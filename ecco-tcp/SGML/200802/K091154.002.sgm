<P>A Sincere e&s;teem for the Drama, ardent wi&s;hes for the pro&s;perity of the Stage, admiration of the beauties, and concern for the defects, both in compo&s;ition and action, fir&s;t dictated this work; which from ma|ny flattering in&s;tances of approbation, has, we appre|hend, been conducted with &s;ome &s;hare of ability, upon commendable principles: wherefore, the &s;ame plan will be pur&s;ued that we have hitherto adopted. Not one objection has been offered to our critici&s;ms on the plays which have fallen under our notice; as to our &s;trictures on the performers, we have been accu&s;ed by &s;ome of too much lenity, by others, of too much &s;everity; a few of the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable objects mentioned, have taken great umbrage at the &s;uppo&s;ed injury done their imaginary merits; of their ignorant, illiberal re&s;ent|ment we have heard, with an equal mixture of pity and contempt; re&s;olved neither through fear nor fa|vour to abate the &s;malle&s;t particle of that critical pre|rogative we have a&s;&s;umed; however, the mo&s;t abject, di&s;contented murderers of common &s;en&s;e in either hou&s;e, may rail at the <HI>DRAMATIC CENSOR,</HI> &s;ecure from any trace of re&s;entment for &s;o doing, in this work, if as it is eagerly hoped &s;ome of the deficiencies pointed out are reformed, the ultimate view of this and the former Volume will be fulfilled.</P>
<P>In the wide field of ob&s;ervation before us, &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages and circum&s;tances mu&s;t no doubt e&s;cape, though equally de&s;erving regard with &s;everal of tho&s;e we note: however, we flatter our&s;elves, nothing material has
<PB REF="5">
as yet &s;lipped us, or will hereafter be omitted; and that a review of the work when compleated will prove, that intere&s;t and malevolence, the two wor&s;t in|fluences authors can write under, have been equally di&s;tant both from our heads and hearts.</P>

<HEAD>JULIUS CAESAR. A TRAGEDY by SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>IF powerfully inculcating one of the noble&s;t principles that actuates the human mind, the love of national liberty, can &s;tamp additional value upon works of genius, we may venture to pronounce the tragedy now before us, as to the &s;ubject of it, high|ly de&s;erving of attention from an Engli&s;h audience; in re&s;pect of the executive part, a review of the &s;e|veral &s;cenes will, we hope, furni&s;h a competent idea.</P>
<P>At the commencement of this piece, the author introduces two Romans of character and public &s;pirit reproving the mob with great energy for making holiday on Cae&s;ar's account, in who&s;e am|bition the freedom of their country had found a grave. The remon&s;trances of Marullus and Fla|vius
<PB N="2" REF="8">
are pathetically per&s;ua&s;ive, and the mob reply with humorous, characteri&s;tic bluntne&s;s; however, we are not fond of &s;uch ludicrous matter in a tra|gedy, and wi&s;h the piece could have been &s;aved from the intru&s;ion of inadequate characters, with|out enervating &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, which as they &s;tand at pre&s;ent di&s;cover peculiar force.</P>
<P>As Cae&s;ar goes to the Cour&s;e he is acco&s;ted by a Sooth&s;ayer, who warns him to beware of the Ides of March, this prediction, however, he treats with contempt, and pa&s;&s;es on to the games, leaving Bru|tus and Ca&s;&s;ius on the &s;tage; from the former's declining to join the public fe&s;tivity, his friend takes occa&s;ion to hint a gloomine&s;s which &s;eems to have hung for &s;ome time on his di&s;po&s;ition; Bru|tus being &s;o touched, confe&s;&s;es that pa&s;&s;ions of &s;ome difference cloud his mind; upon this foundation Ca&s;&s;ius works with great &s;ubtlety to feel the pul&s;e of his political principles; a di&s;tant &s;hout occa&s;ions Brutus to expre&s;s apprehen&s;ion that the people are conferring royalty upon Cae&s;ar, whom Ca&s;&s;ius, in a long, &s;pirited, and picture&s;que &s;peech endeavours to depreciate, by an unfavourable compari&s;on with him&s;elf; however, there is more of o&s;tentatious va|nity than found argument in it, for the &s;trength of a very brave and good man might fail in &s;wimming, and his tongue, parched with feveri&s;h thir&s;t, call for drink without any ju&s;t imputation again&s;t his cou|rage; the next &s;peech of Ca&s;&s;ius, where he accu&s;es the Romans of en&s;laving them&s;elves, and compares Brutus with Cae&s;ar, applies clo&s;ely to the point in view.</P>
<P>Brutus perceiving the drift of Ca&s;&s;ius, replies with &s;en&s;ible re&s;erve, but delivers one po&s;itive and
<PB N="3" REF="9">
noble declaration, that he would prefer a &s;tate of rural ob&s;curity rather than confe&s;s him&s;elf a citizen of Rome, under a di&s;graceful &s;tate of public af|fairs. Here their conver&s;ation is judiciou&s;ly inter|rupted by the return of Cae&s;ar and his train: what the conqueror of the world &s;ays in this &s;cene is very unimportant, and we heartily concur with BEN JOHNSON, that his quaint remark upon the leanne&s;s of Ca&s;&s;ius de&s;erves to be &s;neered at; indeed, &s;ome good rea&s;ons for &s;u&s;pecting that &s;enator of gloomy de&s;igns are &s;ubjoined, but how the author could carry Cae&s;ar off the &s;tage with an une&s;&s;ential, ridi|culous remark on the deafne&s;s of one of his own ears, we cannot conceive.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene Ca&s;ca, with a blunt peculiarity, informs Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius what happened while the people were offering Cae&s;ar a crown; his picture of popular vehemence, irregularity and weakne&s;s, is ju&s;t and &s;triking, but &s;weaty nightcaps need not have been mentioned: upon Brutus's ob&s;erving that Cae&s;ar is liable to the falling &s;ickne&s;s, Ca&s;&s;ius makes a mo&s;t emphatic and comprehen&s;ive reply in two lines: at the conclu&s;ion of this interview, our author has, with &s;ingular judgment, given Ca&s;|&s;ius a &s;oliloquy, which fully explains his own prin|ciples and character, while it throws &s;ome di&s;tant light on the contra&s;t di&s;po&s;ition of Brutus, which being generous, open and un&s;u&s;pecting, Ca&s;&s;ius ju&s;tly thinks well calculated for him to work upon, thereby to gratify his per&s;onal re&s;entment again&s;t Cae&s;ar.</P>
<P>Ca&s;ca and Cicero are next brought in view, a|larmed at violent, elementary concu&s;&s;ions and &s;trange prodigies; the de&s;criptive part is powerful
<PB N="4" REF="10">
and poetical. When Cicero retires, Ca&s;&s;ius ap|pears, who &s;eems to rejoice in the a&s;toni&s;hing cir|cum&s;tances which &s;urround Rome, and infers from them, matters of important dependancy relative to the &s;tate: upon mention of Cae&s;ar, as king, Ca&s;&s;ius proclaims a re&s;olution of never &s;ubmitting to what he terms &s;lavery; to this Ca&s;ca agrees, and hence a dawn of the con&s;piracy, again&s;t Cae&s;ar breaks upon the audience; when Cinna enters, Ca&s;&s;ius declares him one of his faction: Brutus being mentioned as a mo&s;t de&s;irable addition to the party, Ca&s;&s;ius gives &s;ome papers calculated for that purpo&s;e, and directs how they may be thrown in the way of Brutus's ob&s;ervation; with which preparative circum&s;tances, and a &s;hort, but energetic elogium on the popularity of Brutus, the fir&s;t act properly and agreeably con|cludes.</P>
<P>Brutus is introduced at the beginning of the &s;e|cond act, as meditating by &s;tar-light; and his &s;o|liloquy re&s;pecting Cae&s;ar's greatne&s;s, is finely ima|gined, e&s;pecially that part of it which touches on ambition. Upon Lucius's bringing &s;ome papers found in his ma&s;ter's &s;tudy, Brutus que&s;tions him, whether to-morrow is not the Ides of March; this, though apparently a trifling point of interrogation, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a good preparative for the death of Cae&s;ar, which has been predicted at that time.</P>
<P>Upon peru&s;al of what Lucius has brought him, he finds a dark, yet forcible in&s;inuation, relative to the en&s;laved &s;tate of Rome, and his own inactivity. He explains the matter, takes the point home to him&s;elf, and with ju&s;t, patriotic feeling, determines to attempt the redre&s;s of his country's wrongs,
<PB N="5" REF="11">
upon being told that Ca&s;&s;ius and &s;ome other per&s;ons are come to wait upon him, he concludes, we think rather too ha&s;tily, that they are the con&s;piracy; he has rea&s;on to apprehend much public di&s;content, but there does not appear any foundation for his &s;uppo&s;ing an actual con&s;piracy is formed.</P>
<P>When the con&s;pirators enter, Ca&s;&s;ius introduces them &s;everally, and the reception they meet is cor|dial. Our author manife&s;ts great judgment in communicating the matter they come upon a|&s;ide, and happily threw in to fill up, the digre&s;|&s;ion of where the &s;un ri&s;es. At the propo&s;ition or an oath to bind mutual fidelity, Brutus characteri&s;ti|cally refu&s;es &s;o &s;u&s;picious an obligation upon noble, generous minds, and eloquently &s;hews why the cau&s;e alone is &s;ufficient to bind them, or if not that, nothing can; the manner of debating who are fit for their purpo&s;e is very natural, and Brutus's ob|jection to cutting off Antony, merely as a friend to Cae&s;ar, heroically humane; the knowledge De|cius di&s;plays of Cae&s;ar's di&s;po&s;ition, and the u&s;e he propo&s;es to make of it, &s;hew deep policy; the warning Brutus gives his friends to wear di&s;engaged looks, is prudent: upon calling to Lucius, and per|ceiving that he is a&s;leep, Brutus &s;hews mo&s;t plea|&s;ing benevolence of di&s;po&s;ition, by leaving his boy's &s;lumber undi&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Introducing Portia, though what &s;he &s;ays cannot affect an audience much, is judicious, as it is a re|lief to the other &s;cenes, and approaches the pathetic, though it cannot touch the tender feelings. Her method of &s;ounding the care which lies heavy on him, and his method of declining an explanation, are &s;en&s;ibly natural; however, to &s;often the pre&s;ent
<PB N="6" REF="12">
re&s;erve, he promi&s;es future information, and &s;ends her off to make way for a vi&s;itant, Caius Ligarius, with whom a very unimportant conference en&s;ues, which we think is left out and properly in the re|pre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Cae&s;ar appears next in his palace, evidently a|larmed at the turbulence of the preceding night, and orders the prie&s;ts to do pre&s;ent &s;acrifice; Cal|phurnia approaches, filled with dreadful apprehen|&s;ions, and by drawing a &s;trong picture of tho&s;e prodigies which have been recounted to her, endea|vours to di&s;&s;uade Cae&s;ar from going to the capitol; however, he &s;eems to treat omens with &s;en&s;ible con|tempt, and even rejects the unfavourable opinion of the Augurs; at la&s;t, Calphurnia's tender remon|&s;trances prevail, and he con&s;ents that Antony &s;hall acquaint the &s;enate with his re&s;olution not to go.</P>
<P>Matters thus circum&s;tanced, Decius Brutus ap|pears, as being deputed to &s;olicit Cae&s;ar's appear|ance at the capitol, which, after &s;ome refu&s;al, by touching Cae&s;ar's vanity, and alarming him with the imputation of fear, he works him up to go; the re&s;t of the con&s;pirators coming to attend him, he re|&s;olves to accompany them, and propo&s;es previous refre&s;hment, which occa&s;ions Brutus to make a mo&s;t beautiful reflection on Cae&s;ar's un&s;u&s;pecting mind, and their own fatal di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<Q><L>That every like is not the &s;ame, oh Cae&s;ar!</L>
<L>The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon.</L></Q>
<P>In the next &s;cene we meet Artemidorus, a &s;ooth|&s;ayer, peru&s;ing a paper de&s;igned for Cae&s;ar, wherein he warns that monarch of all the con&s;pirators by name, Portia, anxious for the great event depend|ing,
<PB N="7" REF="13">
comes on in a &s;tate of very natural confu&s;ion, di&s;patching Lucius for intelligence; her disjointed manner of &s;peaking is well imagined; upon que&s;|tioning Artemidorus, &s;he collects fre&s;h fear of a di&s;covery, and retires confe&s;&s;ing the full force of womani&s;h apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>The third act opens with Cae&s;ar entering the &s;e|nate, when he is addre&s;&s;ed by Artemidorus, who urges attention to the paper he offers, as being of near concern to him&s;elf, which Cae&s;ar therefore very nobly declines, as being lea&s;t worthy of pre&s;ent re|gard; tho&s;e doubts which SHAKESPEARE has fur|ni&s;hed the con&s;pirators with, are naturally the con|&s;equence of feelings concerned in &s;uch an important and precarious undertaking.</P>
<P>When Metellus kneeling adulates Cae&s;ar with multiplied titles, the monarch replies like a truly great man, but u&s;es &s;ome terms too much in the ba&s;haw &s;tile; upon the repeated &s;olicitations of dif|ferent &s;enators to favour Cimber's &s;uit, he well de|&s;cribes and manife&s;ts his own firmne&s;s: upon his confirmed refu&s;al, Ca&s;ca, according to appointment, gives the fir&s;t &s;tab, upon which all the re&s;t follow his blow, and the world's great conqueror falls be|neath a multitude of wounds, &s;eeming to di&s;dain every me&s;&s;enger of fate, but that &s;ent by Brutus; here our author's judgment de&s;erves great prai&s;e, in giving Cae&s;ar no more to &s;ay than hi&s;tory autho|rizes; but after &s;peaking Engli&s;h through every &s;cene and &s;peech before, why he &s;hould introduce <HI>et tu Brut&eacute;</HI> is not &s;o obvious as might be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>The exultation of the con&s;pirators, and the me|thods they propo&s;e for reconciling this great, un|thought of event to the people, are well conceived;
<PB N="8" REF="14">
however we may applaud the glorious impul&s;e of patrioti&s;m which cau&s;ed Brutus to &s;acrifice &s;o &s;in|cere and powerful a friend to the liberties of his country, yet we heartily concur with Mr. POPE, that the &s;peech concerning dipping their hands in Cae&s;ar's blood, is much more &s;uitable to any other con&s;pirator than him.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEARE was judiciou&s;ly fond of realizing mimic repre&s;entation as much as po&s;&s;ible, for which purpo&s;e the following lines in this piece were cer|tainly and happily intended.</P>
<Q><L>How many ages hence,</L>
<L>Shall this our lofty &s;cene be acted o'er</L>
<L>In &s;tates unborn, and accents yet unknown;</L>
<L>How many times &s;hall Cae&s;ar bleed in &s;port,</L>
<L>Who now on Pompey's ba&s;is lies along,</L>
<L>No worthier than the du&s;t.</L></Q>
<P>Antony's &s;ervant, in a very plau&s;ible &s;tile, offers from his ma&s;ter conciliating motives to the con&s;pi|rators, who promi&s;e him &s;afety for his appearance; he is introduced much too &s;oon, as there are but three lines from the &s;ervant's going till he comes on, which mu&s;t oblige us to imagine him waiting at the door, where he would by no means have tru&s;ted him&s;elf, after he had fled to his hou&s;e amazed, without &s;ome credible a&s;&s;urance of protection.</P>
<P>When Mark Antony enters he follows an amiable, natural impul&s;e, which directs him to pay his fir&s;t regard to the dead body of his royal friend, with|out even ca&s;ting a glance at his &s;urrounding mur|derers; his addre&s;s to tho&s;e real or pretending pa|triots is pathetic and &s;pirited, Brutus's reply cordial and &s;en&s;ible; there is &s;omething hypocritical, yet
<PB N="9" REF="15">
politic, in &s;haking hands with the blood-&s;tained con&s;pirators, the action le&s;&s;ens him in our e&s;teem, yet the de&s;ign, which may be ea&s;ily perceived, com|mands our approbation. Ca&s;&s;ius pinching him clo&s;e, he makes a &s;econd &s;erious declaration of at|tachment to the popular party, which rather lays him low in the view of truth, but to be upon a level with rogues, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in power, integrity mu&s;t become flexible, and &s;ometimes &s;ubmit to wear a ma&s;k.</P>
<P>Antony's de&s;ire of leave to pronounce Cae&s;ar's funeral elogium, &s;trikes even &s;low perception with a more exten&s;ive meaning than is expre&s;&s;ed, which Ca&s;&s;ius very prudently adverts to; however, Bru|tus gives a rea&s;on, &s;avouring of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, why it is not dangerous to give Antony the privilege of the ro&s;trum; therefore con&s;igns Cae&s;ar's corp&s;e to his care, only re&s;erves to him&s;elf the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;peaking to the people: this point being &s;ettled, the con&s;pirators retire, and leave Antony to vent his feelings more at large, which he does in a very ma&s;t|erly &s;oliloquy, admirably &s;uited to his &s;ituation. Upon the appearance of a me&s;&s;enger from Octavius Cae&s;ar, he warns the young Prince to avoid the dan|ger of entering Rome in &s;o critical a &s;tate of af|fairs, mentions the trial he intends to make of po|pular affection, and then goes off with his imperial ma&s;ter's body.</P>
<P>Brutus, attended by the Plebeians, next &s;trikes our view, he mounts the ro&s;trum, and di&s;patches Ca&s;|&s;ius to divide the multitude; in his addre&s;s to tho&s;e who &s;tay to hear him, his oratory di&s;covers it&s;elf in that warm glow of &s;entiment, that nervous, yet un|adorned flow of expre&s;&s;ion, which di&s;tingui&s;hes elo|quence,
<PB N="10" REF="16">
founded upon con&s;cious hone&s;ty: he ap|peals to feelings of a &s;ocial, virtuous and patriotic nature; he appeals to the dulle&s;t conception, by a beautiful antithe&s;is of his great love for Cae&s;ar, and his &s;uperior regard for the liberties of Rome; &s;ub|mitting, at la&s;t, with tempered dignity, and ju&s;t confidence, his part in the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of great Ju|lius, to public opinion, even among the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of the people; &s;uch as &s;ome of our pre&s;ent, &s;mart Engli&s;h &s;enators have called the <HI>&s;cum of the earth.</HI> Upon Antony's approach with Cae&s;ar's body, he, according to promi&s;e, gives place, and retires with a glorious ob&s;ervation, that the &s;ame weapon which &s;tabbed his be&s;t friend, is ready to a&s;&s;ail his own heart, if ever the public &s;afety &s;hould require it.</P>
<P>Upon Antony's mounting the ro&s;trum, it imme|diately occurs, that a great contra&s;t of manner, &s;tile and argument, &s;hould be adopted; this ardu|ous variation we hope SHAKESPEARE will appear amply qualified for upon due in&s;pection. The Plebeians &s;eem to have received &s;o &s;trong a preju|dice in favour of the con&s;piracy from Brutus's ora|tion, that to impre&s;s an oppo&s;ite opinion, appears al|mo&s;t impracticable; in&s;omuch, that upon Antony's even mentioning the name of Brutus, a jealou&s;y of his meaning &s;tarts up among&s;t the mob; this circum|&s;tance is a very artful and natural preparation for what follows.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;peech of Antony, we di&s;cover a beau|tiful, yet mode&s;t elogium, upon the merits of Cae|&s;ar, mingled with ironic&aacute;l compliments to the con|&s;pirators, particularly Brutus; he clo&s;es it with a proper, pathetic appeal, to his own mournful feel|ings on the occa&s;ion, which evidently touches the
<PB N="11" REF="17">
Plebeians, and lays their hearts open to the im|pre&s;&s;ion he apparently wi&s;hes to work upon them. In the next &s;peech, our orator, with deep policy, obliquely hints, that he could communicate &s;ome inflammatory intelligence, but through his re&s;pect to Brutus, declines the office; he then plays a prin|cipal engine again&s;t their prejudice, by mentioning the will of Cae&s;ar, as a mo&s;t intere&s;ting concern to them; with the true violence of mobbi&s;h &s;pirits, they de&s;ire the will may be read, this the orator mo&s;t &s;hrewdly evades to increa&s;e their eagerne&s;s, and that it may work the more powerful effect, &s;hews them the &s;everal wounds in Cae&s;ar's coar&s;e, pointing out each man who &s;tabbed him, by name.</P>
<P>The piteous &s;pectacle inflames the mob to &s;udden exclamations of de&s;perate tendency; this agitation of mind Antony avails him&s;elf of, by &s;eeming to &s;often their re&s;entment, which, like an inadequate quantity of water thrown upon powerful flames, tends to make it rage the fiercer. Thus rou&s;ed, he confirms their fury, by reminding them of, and reading to them Cae&s;ar's will, wherein they find a re&s;pectful and con&s;iderable remembrance of the Roman citi|zens; this corroborates all preceding circum&s;tances, and they go off, denouncing mo&s;t terrible threats again&s;t the con&s;pirators. This &s;cene finely exhibits the mutability and incon&s;i&s;tency of popular affec|tion, which an artful, plau&s;ible orator, can warp from attachment to antipathy, from the mo&s;t wor|thy to the mo&s;t worthle&s;s object of human con&s;ide|ration: an excellent le&s;&s;on this for all &s;tates, more e&s;pecially free ones.</P>
<P>By a &s;ervant Antony is informed of Octavius's arrival at Rome, and goes to meet him at Cae&s;ar's
<PB N="12" REF="18">
hou&s;e: after this, comes a mo&s;t une&s;&s;ential &s;cene, omitted in repre&s;entation; a &s;cene without any meaning, unle&s;s from the treatment Cinna meets with: we deduce a truth, mo&s;t generally known, that an enraged mob, in the mid&s;t of precipitation, will as &s;oon &s;acrifice an innocent as a guilty object, &s;o wild, &s;o unprincipled are in general their re&s;o|lutions.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act, we find the bloody triumvirate, Octavius, Antonius and Lepidus, con&s;ulting who &s;hall fall the victim of their di&s;plea|&s;ure, or ambitious views, in which cruel &s;cheme we perceive they proceed upon principles of great con|de&s;cen&s;ion to each other; however, when Lepidus di&s;appears, we find he is made a mere tool to the other two, particularly Antony; they go off, de|termining to make head again&s;t the warlike prepa|tions of Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene Brutus appears, encamped near Sardis; after &s;ome previous conver&s;e with Pindarus and Lucilius, by which we are informed, that he &s;u&s;pects a decline of friend&s;hip in Ca&s;&s;ius; the ac|cu&s;ed per&s;on appears, and recriminates a charge of wrong upon Brutus; an explanation is warmly urged, when the latter prudently advi&s;es an ab&s;tract|ed di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of their affairs, that their armies may not be acquainted with &s;o important and prejudicial a di&s;&s;ention: for this powerful rea&s;on they retire to Brutus's tent, where the matter is re&s;umed with great eagerne&s;s by Ca&s;&s;ius, and maintained with much philo&s;ophical dignity by Brutus.</P>
<P>A money matter &s;eems the point in di&s;pute: Brutus, with a noble elevation of mind, expre&s;&s;es his contempt of &s;ordid &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and with con&s;iderable
<PB N="13" REF="19">
a&s;perity, reproaches Ca&s;&s;ius, not only for refu&s;ing him &s;ome &s;upplies he had &s;olicited, but even with venality in &s;elling public offices; &s;uch &s;tinging al|legations would rou&s;e a more patient &s;pirit than Ca&s;&s;ius &s;eems to have: in &s;hort, the whole &s;cene is a powerful, beautiful, in&s;tructive contra&s;t; &s;hew|ing the great advantage cool deliberation of mind has over intemperate ra&s;hne&s;s. Their reconciliation is brought about in a very becoming manner. SHAKESPEARE, immediately after this noble inter|view, for what rea&s;on we cannot divine, has intro|duced a poet, to &s;peak &s;ome as trifling and &s;uperflu|ous lines as ever were penned; &s;o di&s;graceful a rhimer is ju&s;tly bani&s;hed the &s;tage.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of Portia's death is well men|tioned, and Brutus's behaviour quite characteri&s;tic; we al&s;o much approve the &s;hort debate which ari&s;es upon marching to Philippi, as it brings to view the main &s;tory. If we could reli&s;h gho&s;ts, Julius Cae|&s;ar's, in the tent of Brutus, would be very admi&s;&s;ible; in action, it certainly gives &s;olemnity, and makes a &s;triking conclu&s;ion to the fourth act. This gho&s;t is introduced upon the &s;tage, and we think very ab|&s;urdly, a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>Antony and Octavius begin the fifth act, in the fields of Philippi; after a few &s;hort &s;peeches, Bru|tus, Ca&s;&s;ius, and their party appear, when a parly and conference en&s;ue; it may perhaps be an in|&s;tance of over&s;trained delicacy, to make an objecti|on to what pa&s;&s;es between the ho&s;tile leaders upon this occa&s;ion, but we apprehend the terms of re|probation they exchange, are not quite con&s;i&s;tent with &s;uch exalted characters.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20">What Ca&s;&s;ius &s;ays to Me&s;&s;ala, after Octavius and Antony go off, concerning unfavourable omens, is very preparative for the cata&s;trophe of the piece; the parting of Brutus and Ca&s;&s;ius, from the po&s;&s;ibi|lity of never meeting again, is truly pathetic, and well performed, mu&s;t deeply &s;trike every generous mind.</P>
<P>The battle now begins, Ca&s;&s;ius's party gives way; unable to bear the idea of defeat, that chief, with the &s;ame precipitation of temper which has all a|long marked his character, determines upon death; and commands Pindarus to perform, what among&s;t the Romans was deemed an act of friend&s;hip, ad|mini&s;tring of fate: from what follows, it appears, that a mi&s;take has led him into this irreparable &s;tep, which affects Titinius &s;o much, that he puts an end to his own burthen&s;ome being with Ca&s;&s;ius's &s;word. The &s;cenes between this, and that of Brutus and his friends, after a total defeat, are very trifling; nor can we think that SHAKESPEARE has taken &s;o much care to render his amiable hero's fall impor|tant, as he might have done: in the la&s;t &s;cene An|tony pronounces a very ju&s;t and conci&s;e, yet copious elogium upon Brutus.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject of this tragedy is of a very intere&s;t|ing nature, and its tendency &s;ingularly u&s;eful in a &s;tate like that of Great Britain. The unities are no doubt &s;adly mutilated, yet does it not appear in re|pre&s;entation &s;o irregular as it really is; the cha|racters are very numerous, and tho&s;e of any con&s;i|deration, &s;upported with great con&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>Julius Cae&s;ar appears po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch intrepidity and openne&s;s of mind, as recommend him, though the en&s;laver of his country, to the re&s;pect of an
<PB N="15" REF="21">
audience; as a part, there is no opportunity for an actor to di&s;play capital abilities; the be&s;t per&s;onators of him we remember were Me&s;&s;rs. BRIDGWATER and SPARKS.</P>
<P>Brutus is a character of &s;ingular dignity, amiable in every point of view, except that violent breach of gratitude, con&s;piring again&s;t, and per&s;onally a&s;&s;ail|ing the life of a man, who, upon mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted principles, had proved him&s;elf his fa&s;t friend; this is a point of doubt, which has been often debated, and as often left undetermined: however, as the Ro|man idea of patrioti&s;m, not only ju&s;tified, but applaud|ed a man, even in the act of &s;uicide, where the good of his country was e&s;&s;entially concerned. It may ea&s;ily be admitted an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule, to &s;acrifice the deare&s;t friend, nay, the neare&s;t relation, for the &s;ame glorious cau&s;e; and, in this view, Brutus &s;tands ex|culpated, for Cae&s;ar's u&s;urpation of power, mo&s;t certainly broke off all &s;ocial connection between him and every citizen, influenced by the principles of liberty.</P>
<P>After this defence, we are &s;orry that he appears only as a tool of Ca&s;&s;ius's policy, in the piece before us; his own virtue and &s;en&s;ibility do not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient activity to lead in the cau&s;e of patrioti&s;m, though, when rou&s;ed, they join the general concern with cordiality and firmne&s;s. A mind of &s;potle&s;s integrity, &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s him through the whole; and though there is a &s;light charge of weakne&s;s a|gain&s;t him, yet there is an engaging uniformity which pre&s;erves him in our e&s;teem while alive, and renders his fall an incident of tender concern.</P>
<P>Brutus requires good, but not exten&s;ive powers of repre&s;entation; a graceful figure, with full, pla|cid
<PB N="16" REF="22">
articulation of voice, mu&s;t, in this part, &s;uffici|ently gratify a &s;en&s;ible &s;pectator. Mr. QUIN hav|ing much le&s;s monotony in Brutus than any other tragedy part, that is the ver&s;e not affording him &s;o many opportunities for periodical cadences, he ap|peared more re&s;pectable, and le&s;s offen&s;ive than the bu&s;kin generally rendered him. His oration to the Plebeians had great, and his &s;cene with Ca&s;&s;ius very &s;ingular merit; in &s;everal other places he was heavy and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN, curtailed by nature of almo&s;t every favourable, adequate, external requi&s;ite, yet manife&s;ted great judgment in this character, main|taining &s;tricter equality through the whole than Mr. QUIN; if he could not ri&s;e &s;o high in the view of critici&s;m, neither did he fall &s;o low. His per&s;on, though unimportant, by the aid of dre&s;s, was not totally void of re&s;pect: but a &s;tiff &s;amene&s;s of action, frequently ri&s;ing to extravagance, &s;uper-added artificial to natural deficiency. SHAKE|SPEARE's meaning he clearly conceived, and fully conveyed, but frequent, ungracious &s;nip-&s;nap breaks of voice, and a painful attempt to keep up the la&s;t &s;yllable of every &s;entence, his peculiar fault, gave &s;trong &s;pecimens of oratorical di&s;&s;onance. Mr. WALKER, within the&s;e few years, made a decent &s;hift with the part at Covent Garden; at pre&s;ent, there is not the &s;lighte&s;t trace of it to be found at either hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ius is in every re&s;pect a &s;triking contract to Brutus; an enemy to Cae&s;ar rather from envy and private pique, than public &s;pirited principles: proud, impatient, &s;ubtle, ira&s;cible, without any kind of virtue, but the military one of courage, to re|commend
<PB N="17" REF="23">
him; yet from &s;ome &s;pirited and plau&s;i|ble declarations in the cau&s;e of freedom, an audi|ence are induced to view him as a more valuable object than he really is, and though his fall appears to be an unju&s;tifiable effect of impetuo&s;ity, yet we are apt to lament it.</P>
<P>As a part, the repre&s;entation of Ca&s;&s;ius is more difficult, and requires much greater powers of ex|pre&s;&s;ion than Brutus; however, this is to be re|marked, that an indifferent actor can much more ea&s;ily catch applau&s;e from an injudicious audience in the former, than the latter; indeed, if two capital performers, of equal merit, pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the public in the&s;e characters, the odds are great but Ca&s;&s;ius out&s;trips his competitor in noi&s;y appro|bation. In the cour&s;e of our theatrical ob&s;ervation, we recollect but one good Ca&s;&s;ius, Mr. RYAN; the techy degree of pa&s;&s;ion de&s;cribed in this part, and the general mode of mind which actuates it, he hit off in a very characteri&s;tic manner. Mr. MOS|SOP, in attempting this fiery Roman, &s;hewed much power, but very little nature; and every other can|didate we have &s;een &s;unk below contempt; he is, like Brutus, &s;o unhappily &s;ituated, as not to have the &s;hadow of a repre&s;entative at either theatre,</P>
<P>Ca&s;ca's cynical roughne&s;s was admirably de|&s;cribed by Mr. SPARKS, nor did he &s;u&s;tain much injury from Mr. RIDOUT's abilities; yet even this con&s;pirator would find but indifferent &s;upport from any exi&s;ting &s;on of the bu&s;kin.</P>
<P>From the outlines of Mark Antony's character, as drawn not only by his friend Cae&s;ar, but the con|&s;pirators al&s;o, we &s;hould be apt to deem him a mere trifling, unimportant reveller; yet, when circum|&s;tances
<PB N="18" REF="24">
call for &s;erious attention, we perceive him to be a very &s;hrewd, plau&s;ible and deep politician; a per&s;ua&s;ive orator, an active and re&s;olute &s;oldier: his manner of working up the Plebeians is ma&s;terly, and &s;hews a thorough knowledge of life.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY, beyond a doubt, &s;tands foremo&s;t in our approbation for this part, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a very adequate figure, an harmonious voice, and all the plau&s;ibility of in&s;inuation that SHAKESPEARE meant; however, we think that critic an enthu&s;ia&s;tic ad|mirer, who, &s;peaking of him in the ro&s;trum, ex|claimed, that Paul never preached &s;o well at Athens. It is certain, nature in this, as well as all his drama|tic undertakings, furni&s;hed him with almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;t|able recommendations; but judgment did not &s;eem &s;o much his friend as might have been wi&s;hed. Mr. DIGGES figured, and imagined the part ex|tremely well, but wanted that flow of voice e&s;&s;en|tial to &s;mooth oratory. Mr. DEXTER was pretty and inoffen&s;ive, but very faint and lukewarm. Mr. ROSS &s;tands next to what Mr. BARRY was, and has it in his power to make a very e&s;timable Antony; but with re&s;pect to the &s;tage, this gentleman's incli|nation and abilities &s;eldom accompany each other.</P>
<P>As to the long, &amp;c. of male characters in this tragedy, they are not worth regard; and as to the ladies, all we can &s;ay of them is, that Mrs. WOF|FINGTON, in Portia, de&s;erved more notice than any other lady we have &s;een.</P>
<P>To differ with great men, or e&s;tabli&s;hed opini|ons, is rather hazardous; however, we mu&s;t venture to blame Dr. JOHNSON's feelings, which con&s;ider this piece as cold and unaffecting; we readily admit there is a total want of tho&s;e tender pa&s;&s;ions which
<PB N="19" REF="25">
are e&s;&s;ential to move and plea&s;e female &s;pectators, which prevents it from commanding that &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage it de&s;erves: however, we are hardy enough to contend, that the &s;ubject is truly intere&s;ting, that the thoughts are noble and in&s;tructive, the ver&s;ifica|tion &s;uitable, the orations happily contra&s;ted, the characters well pre&s;erved; and that the whole toge|ther re&s;embles a beautiful fabric, which in general &s;trikes with &s;ingular &s;atisfaction, in &s;pite of &s;ome &s;mall irregularities and blemi&s;hes which appear: had the fifth act been adequate to the other four, we &s;hould not he&s;itate to pronounce SHAKESPEARE's JULIUS CAESAR, a very capital ornament to the &s;tage, and a mo&s;t de&s;irable companion in the clo&s;et; containing many pa&s;&s;ages and circum&s;tances which may improve, not one which can taint the mind.</P>

<HEAD>SCHOOL for RAKES. A COMEDY. ANONYMOUS.</HEAD>
<P>BY a conver&s;ation between Frampton and Willes, at the beginning of this comedy, we find, that Sir William Evans, a Welch baronet, and his family, are arrived at the town-hou&s;e of Lord Eu&s;tace; and from what occurs, e&s;pecially from what Willis lets fall, we may infer that they are not very agreeable gue&s;ts; the baronet's daughter Har|riet is mentioned, and &s;ome de&s;ign, relative to her, dawns upon us: the pertne&s;s of a valet, buoyed up by a ma&s;ter's confidence, is well de&s;cribed in this &s;cene; and the in&s;ults a dependant upon quality is liable to, equally well &s;et forth.</P>
<P>Frampton, who appears a man of principle and &s;en&s;ibility, though by a decay of circum&s;tances re|duced to humour and a&s;&s;i&s;t the licentious pur&s;uits of a di&s;&s;ipated young nobleman, in a very rational &s;oliloquy, after Willis retires, reflects upon his pain|ful &s;ituation, but expre&s;&s;es &s;ome &s;atisfaction, that he has e&s;caped an iniquitous affair then on the tapis, and goes off with a commendable re&s;olution, not to abandon his patron, while &s;urrounded with perplexi|ties, nor to a&s;&s;i&s;t him further than honour and peace of mind allow.</P>
<P>Sir William Evans, his &s;i&s;ter Winifred, and daugh|ter Harriet, as fre&s;h from a journey, next appear: the baronet &s;eems di&s;plea&s;ed at his lordly ho&s;t, but is rallied by his &s;i&s;ter for not having notions of po|litene&s;s
<PB N="21" REF="27">
and family con&s;equence equal to her own; he &s;eems loth to incur obligations; &s;he con&s;iders an interchange of civilities as none. Their altercation &s;ub&s;iding, Sir William addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to Harriet, who appears unexpectedly thoughtful and grave, which, being que&s;tioned, &s;he attributes to fatigue; however, a &s;mall intimation is dropped a&s;ide, &s;igni|fying, that the hou&s;e without its owner, cannot be very agreeable to her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Winifred's de&s;ire that all their acquaintance &s;hould know of the intimacy with Lord Eu&s;tace, is a well applied &s;troke of &s;atire again&s;t the ridiculous admirers of elevated &s;tations.</P>
<P>Upon the baronet's mentioning a de&s;ign of vi&s;it|ing Captain Lloyd, the maiden lady expre&s;&s;es great apprehen&s;ions at the gentleman's coming to Lord Eu&s;tace's; this Sir William is &s;urprized at, the cap|tain being uncle to the per&s;on intended for Mi&s;s Harriet's hu&s;band; here a fre&s;h altercation ari&s;es between the brother and &s;i&s;ter, which is terminated by the former going on his propo&s;ed vi&s;it to Cap|tain Lloyd. When the baronet di&s;appears, Wini|fred drops a piece of information, by which we learn, that her niece's hand is already di&s;po&s;ed of, and therefore beyond the father's power. Here Mi&s;s Harriet appears, and from what pa&s;&s;es between the young lady and her aunt, we perceive that the former entertains unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations for two rea&s;ons fir&s;t, that her marriage is concealed from the baro|net, and next that her hu&s;band has not been in town to receive them; from which la&s;t cau&s;e &s;he draws &s;ome di&s;agreeable doubts of his con&s;tancy. This delicate agitation of mind, Mrs. Winifred endea|vours to compo&s;e, by de&s;canting on her noble con|nection,
<PB N="22" REF="28">
her &s;upporters, coronets, &amp;c. Robin ac|quaints Harriet that Mr. Frampton de&s;ires to &s;peak to her, the ladies go off to meet him immediately in the parlour.</P>
<P>Frampton, in two &s;hort &s;oliloquies, previous to the appearance of the ladies, intimates a &s;trong un|ea&s;ine&s;s of mind at a bu&s;ine&s;s he has in hand, and makes this ju&s;t, in&s;tructive remark, that it is the lowe&s;t, we may add the mo&s;t cruel ba&s;ene&s;s, to be capable of admiring, and betraying an innocent young creature in the &s;ame moment.</P>
<P>From the &s;ucceeding &s;cene we learn, that the ill|ne&s;s of Lord Eu&s;tace's father has been the cau&s;e of that ab&s;ence which Harriet takes unkindly; Framp|ton delivers a very plau&s;ible exculpation of his friend, and expre&s;&s;ing a hope of his &s;peedy arrival, the ladies go off to mend their external appearance again&s;t my lord's approach.</P>
<P>Frampton is now again in &s;oliloquy, which Lord Eu&s;tace interrupts by his approach; a conver&s;ation en&s;ues between the friends, which plainly &s;hews, that Lord Eu&s;tace has &s;en&s;ibility to know that he acts upon very culpable principles, re&s;pecting Harriet; e&s;pecially by drawing her into a feigned marriage, and wanting to ca&s;t her off. Frampton's remon|&s;trances are candid, per&s;ua&s;ive and well applied; among other points of perplexity, Lord Eu&s;tace expre&s;&s;es &s;trong apprehen&s;ion that his villainy will be di&s;covered to Sir William Evans and family, by the compunction of a &s;teward who is dying, and has declared an intention of confe&s;&s;ing his own guilt, in acting the part of a clergyman. To de|feat the chance of a letter from this man reaching improper hands, Lord Eu&s;tace de&s;ires that Framp|ton
<PB N="23" REF="29">
may &s;tay in the hou&s;e, and take care that all letters are fir&s;t brought to him; Frampton re|marks, that it is an irk&s;ome and hateful undertaking, but having promi&s;ed, he &s;eems willing to give all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards preventing a di&s;covery; Lord Eu&s;tace expre&s;&s;es a de&s;ire of &s;eeing Harriet, but Frampton, for prudential rea&s;ons, di&s;&s;uades him, and the fir&s;t ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> concludes here with &s;ome ju&s;t remarks on the e&s;&s;ential, preparatory grounds of amendment in tainted minds; indeed, this entire &s;cene may be called a good, agreeable le&s;&s;on of moral and &s;ocial in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Lord Eu&s;tace begins the &s;econd act, ruminating on his own di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, and the pride of family, which reduces him to &s;uch a dilemma; Ro|bert, as me&s;&s;enger, acquaints him that the ladies are approaching; after a few lines Harriet appears, and with a very natural eagerne&s;s of mind, approaches to embrace the man &s;he con&s;iders as her hu&s;band; but from a &s;udden check of delicacy &s;tops &s;hort, and di&s;covers marks of confu&s;ion for having appeared &s;o forward: Lord Eu&s;tace que&s;tions the cau&s;e of her timidity, and upon Mrs. Winifred's entrance im|mediately after, apologizes for his ab&s;ence at the time of their arrival in town; the old lady grants her excu&s;e with great readine&s;s; Harriet, however, cannot &s;hake off her concern entirely, which occa|&s;ions her aunt to make &s;ome tart ob&s;ervations on &s;uch unbecoming behaviour.</P>
<P>A propo&s;al is made to Lord Eu&s;tace, of opening the marriage affair to Sir William, and Mrs. Wini|fred's kind interpo&s;ition is &s;olicited, but having pro|mi&s;ed his lord&s;hip to maintain &s;ecrecy, &s;he goes off, determined to fulfil the treaty, as &s;he phra&s;es it, and
<PB N="24" REF="30">
leaves the young couple to a tete-a-tete, wherein Harriet continues to urge unfolding the matter to her father; this encrea&s;es his lord&s;hip's embarra&s;|ment much, from which he at length makes a tem|porary e&s;cape, by &s;ugge&s;ting a de&s;ign of going into the country, on pretence of joining his regiment, and promi&s;ing that he will there comply with her reque&s;t. On being que&s;tioned why in his letters to Harriet he has never &s;tiled her wife, the danger of di&s;covery by his father, Lord Delville, is urged as a rea&s;on, and thus the tender, believing, deceived la|dy, is quieted for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Mrs. Winifred re-enters ha&s;tily, and announces the approach of her brother Sir William, who &s;peaks at his entrance &s;ome rough but &s;en&s;ible truths again&s;t the prevalence of luxury; after mak|ing &s;ome ju&s;t remarks on the general relaxation of military duty, and the partial indulgence that is &s;hewn to officers of quality in particular, the baro|net comments upon his daughter's evident altera|tion, and unu&s;ual depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits; being in|terrupted upon that point by Mrs. Winifred, he pa&s;&s;es on to the report of Lord Eu&s;tace's approach|ing marriage, as &s;et forth in one of the public pa|pers. At this unexpected piece of intelligence, Harriet very naturally takes an alarm, while Mrs. Winifred treats the matter with contempt; Lord Eu&s;tace puts a good face on the affair, laughs at news-paper information, and ob&s;erves, that it is one con&s;equence of the liberty of the pre&s;s, for para|graph-writers to marry couples who have &s;carce &s;een each other; however, he admits &s;ome grounds for the report relative to him&s;elf, as Lord Delville had expre&s;&s;ed great liking to Lady Ann Mountfort's
<PB N="25" REF="31">
large fortune. Sir William, in his rough &s;tile, com|ments upon the unnece&s;&s;ary pains of explanation Lord Eu&s;tace has taken, as not thinking the mat|ter of any concern to him or his family. An en|gagement of bu&s;ine&s;s calling the young lord away, he goes off, &s;oliciting leave to vi&s;it the ladies, which is granted. We think the reque&s;t a little odd, and imagine the author forgot that the Evans's were lodged in his lord&s;hip's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Winifred, after chiding her neice for en|couraging groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ions, dips into her favourite theme politics, and by di&s;playing gro&s;s ab&s;urdity, &s;tands before us a &s;evere &s;atire upon tho&s;e who bu&s;y them&s;elves with concerns out of their &s;phere, and quite beyond their conception.</P>
<P>Sir William re-entering with Robert, que&s;tions him fir&s;t about my lord's valet, who is &s;aid to be a very u&s;eful creature in his way; and next concern|ing Frampton, of whom Robert can &s;ay no more than he believes him hone&s;t, becau&s;e Willis does not like him. Towards the end of this conver&s;a|tion, with his tru&s;ty dome&s;tic, the baronet declares he will leave town in a few days, and that his only remaining care is the marriage of his daughter Har|riet with Colonel Lloyd, which he determines &s;hall &s;oon take place.</P>
<P>Frampton and Willis next claim our attention, the latter giving an arch account to the former of the precautionary orders left by Lord Eu&s;tace, to watch clo&s;e and exclude all Sir William's friends. In the cour&s;e of this interview, Willis gives his tongue &s;everal pert liberties re&s;pecting Harriet, which occa&s;ions Frampton to check him with be|coming &s;pirit; an account of Captain Lloyd's con|nection
<PB N="26" REF="32">
with Lord Eu&s;tace, and the foundation of it occurs, when a knocking at the door calls off Willis; Frampton is left to meditate alone; what he utters is to the purpo&s;e, and has force, but we could wi&s;h this gentleman had not been loaded with &s;uch a number of &s;oliloquies; however, his views being worthy a man of honour, every good, tender mind mu&s;t &s;ympathize with and applaud him.</P>
<P>We are now introduced to Sir William and Har|riet, he appears to be engaging his daughter's ap|probation of Colonel Lloyd as a hu&s;band; Robert mentions the approach of Captain Lloyd, and the blunt tar enters clo&s;e at his heels; after a &s;hort com|pliment, he complains of &s;ome difficulty he had in getting to his friends, and in the &s;ea phra&s;e &s;ays, he was near tacking about, had not Robert, by clearing the deck of my lord's impertinent valet, got conve|nient entrance. Upon pointing out the ladies as his &s;i&s;ter and daughter, Lloyd ludicrou&s;ly replies to Sir William, that they are much altered &s;ince la&s;t he &s;aw them, one being grown a young, and the other an old woman; the latter part of this ob&s;er|vation affecting Mrs. Winifred, &s;he retorts upon the captain rather churli&s;hly, by remarking, that he is not <HI>grown</HI> a brute, for he has always been one; this &s;eems the prelude to an altercation of &s;ome bitter|ne&s;s, but the captain gives it a turn, by a&s;king for Sir William's &s;on, the young colonel, who, by his account, has made a &s;lip to London from his quar|ters in Ireland, and therefore, to &s;creen the affair, has changed his name to We&s;ton; this intelligence, with the additional hint that &s;ome female has occa|&s;ioned his journey, ruffies Sir William.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33">A fre&s;h point of debate ari&s;ing between the cap|tain and Mrs. Winifred, Lord Eu&s;tace is mentioned, with whom they both claim a particular intimacy; his lord&s;hip's approaching marriage being again &s;poken of, Harriet feels a fre&s;h alarm, which her aunt endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s; but Captain Lloyd's declaration that he has &s;een the equipage, jewels, liveries, &amp;c. preparatory to the wedding, the young lady's fears appear confirmed, and her confu&s;ion proportionably ri&s;es, till at la&s;t mention being made of &s;ome ea&s;y, country girl, who has been made a fool of by Lord Eu&s;tace, &s;he lo&s;es every trace of re|&s;olution, and faints; this puts her father into a flurry of &s;pirits, &s;he is conducted off by Mrs. Wini|fred, Captain Lloyd goes in &s;earch of the colonel; and Sir William, in a &s;oliloquy, which concludes the &s;econd act, endeavours to account for this &s;udden and extraordinary emotion; however, he &s;hoots wide of the real mark, and might as well have &s;aid nothing, but for the following remark, which is very pregnant with truth and good &s;en&s;e.  <Q REND="inline">"The foibles of youth &s;hould rather be counteracted than op|po&s;ed, le&s;t in endeavouring to weed them out, we may de&s;troy a kindred virtue."</Q></P>
<P>Frampton begins the third act with a few une&s;|&s;ential lines before Willis comes on with &s;ome let|ters he has intercepted; the voluble valet paints his own political dexterity in plea&s;ant, &s;pirited terms, and &s;eems to urge a claim of reward for his a&s;&s;i|duity very home to Frampton, who con&s;idering him as a kind of villainous, though nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;il, di&s;mi&s;&s;es him the room in pretty rough terms, after &s;ecuring the letters, which latter circum&s;tance Wil|lis &s;eems to regret, and goes off grumbling deeply.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="34">Frampton now again &s;oliloquizes, and entertains us with exculpatory meditation re&s;pecting him&s;elf, as intermeddling with the di&s;honourable purpo&s;es of Lord Eu&s;tace, and to relieve his mind re&s;olves up|on delivering the letters to Sir William; at which cri&s;is Lord Eu&s;tace enters to him, enquiring eagerly if he has &s;ecured tho&s;e letters; this draws on a full and emphatic explanation of Frampton's &s;entiments, wherein the breach of ho&s;pitality, as well as common civility, is charged home again&s;t his lord&s;hip, who offers no palliation but the nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation, and warmly de&s;ires to &s;ee the letters; this Framp|ton commendably evades, and baits him with &s;eve|ral in&s;tructive reproaches; the young peer replies in a &s;tile of warm &s;arca&s;m, and the matter ri&s;es to &s;uch a pitch, that Frampton re&s;igns his charge, and renounces his lord&s;hip's friend&s;hip, finding it mu&s;t be held on unworthy terms, and retires.</P>
<P>Willis now comes forward, full of expectation to work on his noble ma&s;ter's weakne&s;s for the reward of his diligence, but Frampton's &s;peedy and unex|pected return interrupts his de&s;ign; he is ordered out of the room, and a fre&s;h conver&s;ation between Lord Eu&s;tace and Frampton en&s;ues, wherein the latter &s;hews a very delicate &s;en&s;ibility for his pa|tron's perplexed &s;ituation, and impre&s;&s;es him with a &s;trong idea of his own mi&s;conduct; this produces a great conce&s;&s;ion from his lord&s;hip, and a cordial reconciliation is the con&s;equence; it is al&s;o re&s;olved, that all Sir William's letters, &s;ave that from Lang|wood, the dying &s;teward, &s;hall be delivered him, for this purpo&s;e they are delivered to Willis.</P>
<P>When his lord&s;hip and Frampton retire, the active valet, with a true &s;pirit of intrigue, deter|mines
<PB N="29" REF="35">
to &s;ee what the important, excepted letter contains; and fiddling about the &s;eal, breaks it before he is aware. This rather alarms him, but a gratification of his curio&s;ity &s;oftens the accident, and he explores the contents with &s;ome laughable ob|&s;ervations, drawing favourable hopes of advantage from the di&s;covery he has made.</P>
<P>Harriet is next di&s;covered alone, expre&s;&s;ing much love for, with painful doubts of Lord Eu&s;tace; en|tering upon &s;o &s;olemn an obligation, in direct breach of offilial duty, adds to her irk&s;ome &s;en&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ons. Sir William enters upon her meditation, and &s;hews a letter he has received from her brother, confirming Captain Lloyd's in&s;inuation, that a lady is the cau&s;e of his vi&s;iting London. Speaking of his &s;on's ma|trimonial views, the baronet utters a &s;entiment every parent &s;hould invariably adopt, that worth and vir|tue are &s;uperior to every con&s;ideration of fortune. Strong marks of melancholly &s;till hanging upon Harriet's countenance, her tender father wants to come at the cau&s;e, which again brings Lord Eu&s;tace under con&s;ideration; the &s;ubject works &s;o &s;trongly upon the young lady, that &s;he a&s;toni&s;hes Sir William with falling at his feet, and works him into &s;trong perplexity by &s;oliciting, in broken &s;entences, his pardon, for having become Lord Eu&s;tace's wife without his knowledge. This circum&s;tance deeply impre&s;&s;es the old man, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e perceives a &s;trong objection, his lord&s;hip's di&s;&s;ipated, licentious di&s;po&s;ition, which cannot afford the pro&s;pect of much conjugal felicity. Harriet, however, pur|&s;ues her tender &s;olicitation, and urges &s;ome excul|patory arguments in her lord's favour, which work the wi&s;hed for effect, and obtain Sir William's for|givene&s;s;
<PB N="30" REF="36">
this &s;ends off the young lady in perfect harmony of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>By the &s;cene which immediately follows between Sir William and Robert, we learn, that the latter has made &s;ome di&s;agreeable ob&s;ervations, and even heard of the impo&s;ition which has been pa&s;&s;ed upon Harriet. This di&s;tracting explanation rou&s;es the baronet, who hearing that Willis is confidante, or|ders Robert to call him: upon the valet's appear|ance he is at fir&s;t que&s;tioned mildly, then with a de|gree of intimidating warmth, concerning Lord Eu&s;tace's marriage; he he&s;itates for &s;ome time, but having a &s;word pointed to his brea&s;t, and fancying Sir William has had information from Langwood, pulls the letter Prampton had charged him to &s;e|crete from his pocket, which the baronet &s;natches; after puzzling each other for a few &s;peeches lon|ger, the valet, terrified for what he has done, makes a confu&s;ed and laughable retreat.</P>
<P>Here Sir William, re&s;olving to have a further explanation, after reading the fatal letter, calls for his &s;i&s;ter and daughter, who both appear on the in|&s;tant; he immediately pronounces the deceit, which overpowers Harriet, and gives Langwood's letter to Mrs. Winifred, who, with her u&s;ual &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, con&s;iders it as a fal&s;e, forged affair; and &s;eems to wonder that her brother can be &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon. This but enflames the baronet's pa&s;&s;ion more, and cau&s;es him, after &s;ome &s;tinging reproaches vented again&s;t his daughter, to hurry off the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Harriet, in the mid&s;t of her confu&s;ion, propo&s;es to fly from Lord Eu&s;tace's dwelling, but Mrs. Wi|nifred per&s;i&s;ting in her opinion, that there is &s;ome impo&s;ition in the affair, advi&s;es her neice to &s;end
<PB N="31" REF="37">
Lord Eu&s;tace a letter; this, though warmly urged, is ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, &s;o that when Harriet retires to avoid further importunity, the aunt determines to write her&s;elf; and though &s;ome doubts re&s;pect|ing Lord Eu&s;tace intrude upon her, yet &s;he cheri&s;hes the comfortable idea, that he dare not deceive her, or, if he does, that the ap Evans's are not to be in|jured with impunity.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act, a new cha|racter is pre&s;ented to us, Colonel Evans. In the conver&s;ation between him and Captain Lloyd, the latter, after blaming young Evans for leaving his regiment &s;o abruptly on a woman's account, apo|logizes in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the indi&s;cretion, by tell|ing what influence a Donna I&s;abella at Gibraltar, had once like to have gained over him&s;elf; after this, the talkative tar enquires minutely into the circum&s;tances of the colonel's fair one, to which he only obtains the general reply, that &s;he is young, hand&s;ome, and of rank above her admirer's expecta|tion; expo&s;ition of her name is declined. After the&s;e gentlemen di&s;appear, who, in our opinion, have &s;aid nothing any way e&s;&s;ential to the piece, nor much to place them in e&s;teem with an audience, Mrs. Winifred and Robert appear, when &s;he receives further proof of Lord Eu&s;tace's treachery. After a few lines, &s;he di&s;patches the hone&s;t dome&s;tic to watch a private door in the garden; here Sir Wil|liam joins his &s;i&s;ter, who wants to argue matters with him, but his temper of mind not &s;uiting her pur|po&s;e, he at fir&s;t an&s;wers rather churli&s;hly; however, &s;he forces her di&s;cour&s;e on him, and propo&s;es to try her influence and Harriet's tears upon Lord Eu&s;tace. This de&s;ign the baronet treats with contempt, and
<PB N="32" REF="38">
thereby irritates his vain &s;i&s;ter; be&s;ides, with be|coming pride, he di&s;dains the thought of his daugh|ter's &s;uing &s;o ba&s;e a man. Another thought ari&s;es in Mrs. Winifred's prolific brain, that as Lord Eu&s;tace has a place at court, Sir William &s;hould complain of him to the king; this romantic idea produces &s;ome ju&s;t compliments to virtuous royalty, but Sir William ca&s;ts &s;o ineffectual a proceeding a&s;ide, and determines upon taking per&s;onal &s;atisfaction, with which &s;pirited re&s;olution he withdraws.</P>
<P>Another very immaterial &s;oliloquy occurs here, at the end of which Robert appears, and informs Winifred, that he has heard the private door in the garden unlocked, this hurries her off to prevent Lord Eu&s;tace's meeting her enraged brother.</P>
<P>Colonel Evans, who as we find has been a&s;&s;ault|ed by footpads, enters with Lord Eu&s;tace, by whom he has been re&s;cued; thanks are returned for the &s;ervice. By a conver&s;ation which en&s;ues, we find, that upon being told the title of his deliverer, Colo|nel Evans looks on him as a rival in the affections of Lady Ann Mountfort; a meeting is propo&s;ed, but declined, as each of the gentlemen is otherwi&s;e particularly engaged: Lord Eu&s;tace partly unfolds his critical &s;ituation with Harriet, but as her name is not mentioned, the colonel remains ignorant that &s;he is his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The next &s;cene Mrs. Winifred brings on Harriet, when Lord Eu&s;tace immediately enters, and endea|vours to &s;ooth that heavy concern which hangs on the young lady; for &s;ome time the aunt harangues him on the charge of infidelity, which he evades with tolerable effrontery, but is reduced to a pain|ful dilemma upon her producing Langwood's letter;
<PB N="33" REF="39">
however, he profe&s;&s;es an hone&s;t de&s;ign, dictated by ardent love, in the clande&s;tine marriage effected him; this &s;trikes Mrs. Winifred with the plea&s;ing hopes of repairing every thing, and &s;he goes off to prevent Sir William from coming abruptly upon the young couple, as they &s;eem to be in a fair train of reconciliation; but this female politician appears much out in her calculation, for Harriet's offended virtue and delicacy remain inexorable to entreaty, and &s;he retires, di&s;claiming every idea of connection with &s;o unworthy a betrayer: here Sir William en|ters, full of the injury done him through his daugh|ter, and a very warm altercation en&s;ues, which is &s;upported on Lord Eu&s;tace's &s;ide with as much de|cent &s;pirit as the circum&s;tances will admit; to Sir William's violent deci&s;ion, he very properly oppo&s;es his own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of error, which is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on why courage &s;hould not exert it&s;elf again&s;t an injured per&s;on; however, the baronet's per&s;i&s;ting in aggravation, compels him at la&s;t to accept the chal|lenge, in con&s;equence of which, a meeting is ap|pointed at eight o'clock the next morning, with &s;e|conds.</P>
<P>After Sir William has expre&s;&s;ed &s;atisfaction that his &s;on the colonel is ab&s;ent, as this affair of the duel mu&s;t have fallen upon him, Mrs. Winifred bolts in, and accu&s;es her brother of turning matters top&s;y|turvy; &s;he al&s;o mentions Harriet's haughty refu&s;al, which &s;eems to give the old gentleman &s;ingular &s;a|tisfaction. His &s;i&s;ter's wi&s;h for being attached to nobility at any rate, gives ri&s;e to &s;ome pertinent re|flections upon the mingled pride and meanne&s;s which mark her character; Sir William treats her notions with a&s;perity and contempt, and then ha&s;tes to
<PB N="34" REF="40">
comfort Harriet, who&s;e rejection of Lord Eu&s;tace, has replaced her in his favour. Mrs. Winifred, in a high mi&s;&s; at the &s;light &s;he has received, wants to a&s;&s;ert her own infallibility, by ca&s;ting the blame of what has happened upon others, and concludes, with ap|plying to her&s;elf Lord Chatham's declaration, of not being accountable for mea&s;ures that &s;he is not &s;uf|fered to guide.</P>
<P>Lord Eu&s;tace and Frampton begin the fifth act, conferring on the unlucky circum&s;tance of the for|mer having met Sir William, and the challenge con|&s;equential to it, which Frampton &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erves, ought not to be fulfilled; however, Lord Eu&s;tace &s;olicits him to act as a &s;econd, which for &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons he denies. Marriage of Harriet is urged as a palliative, but the young peer dreads an imputa|tion of cowardice. Upon Frampton's ab&s;olute de|nial to be concerned, Lord Eu&s;tace reque&s;ts his de|livery of a letter, in ca&s;e he &s;hould fall, to his father, and goes off to &s;earch a le&s;s &s;crupulous friend to act as a &s;econd. Frampton de&s;cants &s;ome time on the contrariety of Lord Eu&s;tace's di&s;po&s;ition, and goes off, re&s;olved to avert, if po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e perils which hang over his head.</P>
<P>Harriet, accompanied by her aunt, gives vent to an unequalled, and apparently incurable perplexity of mind, occa&s;ioned not only by the ba&s;ene&s;s of her &s;uppo&s;ed hu&s;band, but by the impending duel, which &s;he urges Mrs. Winifred to prevent at any rate, for which purpo&s;e the old lady retires ju&s;t as Sir Wil|liam appears: he perceives Harriet's concern, and tenderly tries to &s;often her, but endangering his life on her account, prevents the de&s;ired effect; as the baronet will not relax tho&s;e &s;trict notions of honour,
<PB N="35" REF="41">
which urge him on to &s;o de&s;perate a mode of &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>Captain Lloyd's approach occa&s;ions the afflicted Harriet to retire; we find that the captain has been &s;ummoned to act as Sir William's &s;econd; to this end the baronet acquaints him with the duel he is engaged in; a circum&s;tance which draws from the &s;on of Neptune &s;ome whim&s;ical remarks on fight|ing, for which he &s;eems to have a very good &s;tomach, but thinks breakfa&s;t an e&s;&s;ential preparative. This cau&s;es Sir William to take him into another room, and leaves the &s;tage open for Lord Eu&s;tace, who comes on with Colonel Evans, as his &s;econd.</P>
<P>By what drops from the colonel, we find, his lord|&s;hip, through romantic notions of ju&s;tice, has de|termined to &s;tand Sir William's fire, without re|turning it. At the &s;ame in&s;tant, Harriet and her father enter at oppo&s;ite doors, the colonel is imme|diately &s;aluted with the titles of &s;on and brother, but is reproved as appearing the abettor of that man who has di&s;graced his &s;i&s;ter; this young Evans di&s;claims, and treats Harriet with rough contempt; then takes the quarrel upon him&s;elf, and gives Lord Eu&s;tace a regular challenge, which, upon finding Harriet's innocence, he &s;eems more warmly bent to enforce. As he and Lord Eu&s;tace are going off, Frampton enters, who, hearing Harriet exclaim,  <Q REND="inline">"when will my mi&s;eries end,"</Q> replies,  <Q REND="inline">"I hope this moment, madam."</Q> This dawning of an e|clairci&s;&s;ement occa&s;ions &s;urprize in all the parties, and enquiries of what he means; when he declares, that he has been with, and is ju&s;t come from Lord Delville, who approves Harriet for a daughter-in-law, and has charged him with a letter to Sir Wil|liam
<PB N="36" REF="42">
Evans upon that &s;ubject. This letter being peru&s;ed, the baronet pronounces it a mark of ho|nour in the old peer, yet &s;ays it cannot atone for the mi&s;conduct of his &s;on Lord Eu&s;tace; this &s;tarts a fre&s;h difficulty, which however is removed by a declaration, that Lady Anne Mountfort never was an object of &s;erious attention to Lord Eu&s;tace, and is in reality the lady who&s;e hand is de&s;tined for Co|lonel Evans: hence a reconciliation and mutual congratulations en&s;ue on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Captain Lloyd, upon &s;eeing &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of unexpected characters, &s;eems di&s;appointed that the propo&s;ed engagement is not likely to take place; however, like an hone&s;t, good natured man, &s;ympa|thizes in the general joy, with which the comedy concludes. But what could induce the author to tag half a dozen very indifferent lines together, by way of deducing a moral, we &s;hall not pretend to &s;ugge&s;t; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that we could wi&s;h na|ture and the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode, which rejects rhimes, had been more &s;trictly regarded.</P>
<P>Upon a general view of this comedy, it appears to be written with a good intention; the dialogue has con&s;iderable ea&s;e, but not much &s;pirit or ele|gance; the plot is tolerably intere&s;ting, and the &s;cenes regularly enough di&s;po&s;ed, but the cata&s;trophe is rather huddled up; and the delicacy which Sir William Evans and his daughter &s;eem &s;o &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, at la&s;t vani&s;hes almo&s;t imperceptibly.</P>
<P>The characters, without a grain of originality, are well imagined, and &s;upported with tolerable con&s;i&s;tence; Lord Eu&s;tace is an odd medley of vir|tues and weakne&s;s, for his errors are certainly more the effect of warm pa&s;&s;ions and inadequate judg|ment
<PB N="37" REF="43">
than ab&s;olute vice; there is a face of meanne&s;s in his propo&s;ed connection with Lady Anne, which ca&s;ts a &s;hade that re&s;ts on him, even when matters are made up. In repre&s;entation, he is what per|formers call a tolerable walking gentleman, and is not much beyond the abilities of Mr. CAUTHERLY, who, by never attempting any thing higher, would de&s;erve &s;ome degree of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir William is a per&s;on of nice feelings, and a fond, without being a fooli&s;h father. Mr. HOL|LAND, who was certainly better calculated for a par|ticular ca&s;t in comedy, than any thing he ever did, or could do of a tragic nature, gave ju&s;t and &s;ingu|lar &s;atisfaction in the Welch baronet; &s;ince his death, Mr. HURST has undertaken him, with &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s, which could not happen without &s;ome merit; though certainly the audiences of Lon|don have lately been much weaker in their judg|ment, or more exten&s;ive in good nature, than they were &s;even years ago. May the di&s;po&s;ition conti|nue till there is a fre&s;h &s;upply of intrin&s;ic merit to &s;tand the te&s;t of critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Colonel Evans is a very immaterial object, and can never gain any credit for either author or actor; what can be done for him in action Mr. PALMER &s;upplies agreeably enough.</P>
<P>Frampton is certainly a well drawn child of na|ture; one who, notwith&s;tanding the want of pru|dence to pre&s;erve his circum&s;tances in a &s;tate of comfort and re&s;pect, neverthele&s;s has a heart which &s;corns, even in the mid&s;t of dependance, to flatter or promote for intere&s;t, the vices of an opulent patron; nay, who hazards the favour of that patron by la|bouring to &s;ave him from him&s;elf: he is a mo&s;t ami|able
<PB N="38" REF="44">
agent in the piece, and &s;hould not after his e&s;&s;en|tial, good offices, have been left in &s;uch an unprovided &s;tate at the conclu&s;ion. We know not any character more cha&s;tely or more agreeably performed on ei|ther of the &s;tages than this by Mr. REDDISH, from who&s;e expre&s;&s;ion the valuable &s;entiments flow with peculiar grace and &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Captain Lloyd is well de&s;igned, but underwritten, the lea&s;t entertaining of any &s;ea character on the &s;tage, and mo&s;t evidently borrowed from all who went before him; nothing but the happy conception and exqui&s;ite talents of Mr. KING, could render him &s;o agreeable as he now appears.</P>
<P>Willis &s;eems drawn with judgment and viva|city by the author; nor is the e&s;&s;ential whim and &s;prightline&s;s of repre&s;entation any way deficient in Mr. DODD's very plea&s;ing performance of this laughable and &s;pirited valet. Mr. W. PALMER has upon emergencies made a tolerable &s;hift.</P>
<P>Robert has an agreeable, blunt &s;implicity, and commendable hone&s;ty of character in his compo&s;i|tion; and &s;tood much indebted for the notice he obtained to Mr. BADDELY's characteri&s;tic naivet&egrave; of action.</P>
<P>Mrs. Winifred is a painful, mi&s;erable copy of Mrs. Margate Maxwell, in the DEVIL upon two STICKS: &s;o flat, &s;o impoveri&s;hed, that Mrs. CLIVE's powerful talents alone could have rendered her bear|able: poor Mrs. HOPKINS is as much a&s;leep in the performance, as the author was in writing this part.</P>
<P>Harriet is a tender, &s;en&s;ible, delicate young lady, and in every one of tho&s;e ideas received ample ju&s;tice from the intere&s;ting appearance, and pathetic ex|pre&s;&s;ion of Mrs. BADDELY.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="45">Being much di&s;gu&s;ted, both in the theatre and clo&s;et with a &s;uperabundance of &s;oliloquies in this piece, we have taken pains to count them, and find no le&s;s than twenty-two; the greate&s;t part of which, or at lea&s;t half, falls to Frampton alone; the plot mu&s;t be very hard &s;trained which requires &s;uch aid; however, the SCHOOL for RAKES, from its moral tendency, and the excellent &s;entiments with which in &s;everal places it is &s;prinkled, may be recommended as a comedy more de&s;erving of attention, both in public and private, than many other pieces of much greater critical merit; virtue is patronized and in|culcated through the whole, without being once put to the blu&s;h, or in the lea&s;t degree &s;acrificed to ap|plau&s;e catching humour.</P>

<P>It is u&s;ual to omit the fir&s;t &s;cene of this tragedy in repre&s;entation, which is a &s;tretch of theatrical pre|rogative we do not altogether approve; for though what pa&s;&s;es between Erne&s;to and Paulino is not ab|&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential, yet their conver&s;ation is beyond doubt a very good introduction to the piece, better, as we apprehend, than that with which it now com|mences; however we &s;hall not give the &s;ub&s;tance of what is &s;o little regarded, but begin with the two brothers, who being ju&s;t returned from the chace, mention &s;ome danger that Ca&s;talio has been in, and then pa&s;s on to other matters, till they come at la&s;t
<PB N="41" REF="47">
to mention Monimia, their father's ward. The at|tachment of each to this young lady, occa&s;ions an appearance of di&s;agreement between them, but a &s;oftening conce&s;&s;ion from one, draws from the other a mo&s;t &s;olemn declaration of unalterable friend&s;hip; uttered partly according to the ta&s;te of the day, in rhime, and very little above the degree of doggrel.</P>
<P>When Monimia enters with the page, we &s;oon perceive that her heart is con&s;iderably prejudiced in favour of Ca&s;talio; all her que&s;tions and ob&s;ervations &s;trongly indicate it. Cordelio's replies to her que&s;|tions are in an arch characteri&s;tic &s;tile, but in one &s;peech rather licentious; his account of what he has heard from the brothers, in regard to their love for Monimia, is di&s;tinct and natural; we think Moni|mia's re&s;entment again&s;t the de&s;ign of Ca&s;talio's in|troducing Polydore to a private conference, is very becoming; indeed, there does not &s;eem any colour for &s;uch a paltry conde&s;cen&s;ion in the former, as the latter might have gained an interview without &s;uch an introduction.</P>
<P>When the brothers appear, and Ca&s;talio, accord|ing to promi&s;e, &s;tands ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, the lady expre&s;&s;es confu&s;ion; but why &s;he &s;hould &s;eem to entertain &s;uch dreadful, previous apprehen&s;ions of Polydore, we cannot &s;ay. Ca&s;talio's &s;udden, and we may add, &s;trange departure, ruffles her extreme|ly, and &s;eems to be the only cau&s;e for her ungracious charge of ill gature again&s;t Polydore's countenance, even before he has &s;poke a word; &s;uch treatment is rather cavalier on her &s;ide, yet at fir&s;t occa&s;ions no return but warm declarations of amorous pa&s;|&s;ion, which are well expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;uitably replied to: however, when Monimia comes to a peremp|tory
<PB N="42" REF="48">
refu&s;al of &s;acrificing her honour, why &s;he &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e his profe&s;&s;ions di&s;honourable, we know not. Polydore throws off every trace of the gentleman, and &s;hews him&s;elf the brute Monimia &s;eems to have imagined him. His general &s;arca&s;m again&s;t the whole &s;ex is illiberal, but not without &s;ome truth and con&s;iderable fancy; her reply is couched in very proper and &s;trong terms: what Polydore &s;peaks after &s;he goes off, his allu&s;ion to the bull, &amp;c. is almo&s;t too gro&s;s for a &s;atyr to utter, or a Billing&s;gate fi&s;h-wife to hear; it is highly &s;hameful that &s;omewhat more bearable has not been &s;ub&s;tituted, in&s;tead of &s;uch &s;en&s;ual, filthy tra&s;h.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, Aca&s;to, with his two &s;ons, are pre&s;ented to our view; the old gentleman de&s;cants on the plea&s;ures and dangers of that day's chace; particularly remarking his own critical &s;ituation from the attack of a wild boar, and his fortunate conque&s;t over that furious animal. Recital of this la&s;t circum&s;tance draws from Ca&s;ta|lio a complimentary line, which his father ju&s;tly con&s;iders as bordering on flattery; a depravation of mind he treats with a&s;perity, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing it with great propriety from &s;ocial connections, to the intere&s;ted dependance of court &s;ycophancy; a di&s;&s;embling de|pendance, which he illu&s;trates in very &s;trong co|lours, and corrects with a keen la&s;h of &s;atire: but poets may exhau&s;t their imaginations, and morali&s;ts declaim on the &s;ubject till they are weary; yet mo|de&s;t merit will never gain an equal &s;hare of favour at any court, with &s;ervile effrontery and low artifice.</P>
<P>Serina bringing on the news of Chamont's arri|val, gives Aca&s;to &s;ingular plea&s;ure; he having, as appears, a warm attachment to that young &s;oldier,
<PB N="43" REF="49">
whom he welcomes with the mo&s;t cordial tenderne&s;s. Chamont replies with manly feeling, interchanges &s;ome kind expre&s;&s;ions with his &s;i&s;ter Monimia, and then pays a delicate compliment to Aca&s;to's daugh|ter Serina, which &s;he &s;eems to receive with &s;ome de|gree of tender &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>Aca&s;to, in the flow of dome&s;tic happine&s;s, and in re&s;pect of his royal ma&s;ter's birth-day, orders fe&s;ti|vity through all his hou&s;e; and upon his &s;on's letting fall &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of ardent loyalty, he manife&s;ts a little of the vanity of age, in proclaiming an anecdote of once killing a rebel who uttered di&s;|re&s;pectful terms of his monarch. The laboured panegyrics upon royalty in this &s;cene, were &s;o many &s;ugar-plumbs dropped by our bard to &s;weeten the leading character of his day.</P>
<P>As Aca&s;to is going off to receive &s;ome gue&s;ts who are arrived, Chamont de&s;ires a conference upon matter of &s;erious concern, which being granted, he draws a pathetic, preparative picture of his dying parents, to introduce more &s;trongly the old gentle|man's kind patronage to him&s;elf and his &s;i&s;ter; he then &s;ugge&s;ts a doubt concerning Monimia's &s;itua|tion and behaviour, which Aca&s;to de&s;ires him to clear up, adding a mo&s;t friendly declaration, that he will defend her cau&s;e, even though it &s;hould &s;ubject his own children to prejudice.</P>
<P>Here a conference en&s;ues between Chamont and his &s;i&s;ter, from whence we may infer, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es honour to almo&s;t a romantic degree; but is unac|countably credulous, and unpardonably choleric. His account of their dead father is truly amiable; the dream is fanciful, but a &s;trange foundation for a man of even tolerable under&s;tanding to ground jea|lous
<PB N="44" REF="50">
apprehen&s;ions upon; and the picture of the old hag, who gave his fears confirmation, is inimi|table, &s;o worthy regard, as a beautiful de&s;cription, that we beg leave to tran&s;cribe it; though after all, we judge it a &s;ufficient proof of Chamont's weak|ne&s;s, and wonder at our author for inculcating &s;o ri|diculous an idea of witchcraft.</P>
<Q><L>Through a clo&s;e lane as I pur&s;u'd my journey,</L>
<L>And meditating on my la&s;t night's vi&s;ion,</L>
<L>I &s;pied a wrinkled hag with age grown double,</L>
<L>Picking dry &s;ticks, and mumbling to her&s;elf;</L>
<L>Her eyes with &s;calding rheum were galled and red,</L>
<L>Cold pal&s;y &s;hook her head, her hands &s;eemed wither'd;</L>

<L>Which &s;erv'd to keep her carca&s;e from the cold,</L>

<L>With different colour'd rags; black, red, white, yellow,</L>
<L>And &s;eem'd to &s;peak variety of wretchedne&s;s.</L></Q>
<P>Upon Monimia's &s;olemn declaration of &s;trict ad|herence to virtue, Chamont's &s;trange pa&s;&s;ion cools, and gives her &s;ome friendly, &s;en&s;ible hints, re&s;pect|ing the di&s;&s;imulation of men in &s;ubjects of love. He retires, and the young lady, irritated by Poly|dore's ungenteel treatment, determines, even at the expence of her own peace, to treat Ca&s;talio with &s;everity. His immediate appearance gives her an opportunity of putting this re&s;olution in practice, which &s;he does in part, by quitting the &s;tage as he comes on; this occa&s;ions Ca&s;talio to utter his di&s;&s;a|tisfaction in &s;oliloquy, as al&s;o to &s;ugge&s;t, that he has
<PB N="45" REF="51">
a natural pliantne&s;s of temper which his mi&s;tre&s;s plays upon; he al&s;o confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf wrong in tri|fling with his brother, where &s;o &s;erious a matter is concerned; but flatters him&s;elf, that as it is his fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, no ill con&s;equences will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Polydore here enters, and places that young agent of intrigue, the page, as a &s;py upon his brother and Monimia; when the lovers come forward, we find the lady in a fit of warm re&s;entment, much beyond, as we think, any provocation &s;he has received, and the gentleman for &s;ome time tenderly conde&s;cend|ing; however, &s;tung with reproaches which ari&s;e from mention of Polydore, his temper ri&s;es on the fret, yet his re&s;olution &s;hortly fails, and he &s;inks again into the whine with &s;uch effect, that Monimia &s;oftens into forgivene&s;s, and a &s;udden reconciliation, in the true love &s;tile, en&s;ues; this cau&s;es Ca&s;talio to vent his extraordinary &s;atisfaction in the full &s;low of poe|tical frenzy, rhiming him&s;elf and the fair Monimia mo&s;t harmoniou&s;ly off the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Polydore, with his little &s;py, begin the third act, when a full di&s;covery is made to the former by the latter, of all that pa&s;&s;ed in the foregoing &s;cene; the page having told his tale, is &s;ent off, when a &s;ervant enters with intelligence that Aca&s;to has been &s;ud|denly and violently taken ill at the banquet; the old gentleman &s;oon enters in a &s;tate of weakne&s;s, but recovery; having his children about him, he declares the di&s;po&s;ition of his fortune, in ca&s;e of de|cea&s;e, to be an equal divi&s;ion of his e&s;tate between the brothers, &s;ave a re&s;erve of ten thou&s;and crowns for Monimia. This &s;cene furni&s;hes a &s;trange con|tradictory lap&s;e in Aca&s;to's conduct; for after an equal divi&s;ion of his fortune between Ca&s;talio and
<PB N="46" REF="52">
Polydore, he allots one third of it to Chamont, in ca&s;e of his marriage with Serina, who, in the fir&s;t di&s;po&s;ition of affairs, poor lady! was totally for|got. The&s;e points &s;ettled, Aca&s;to retires to re&s;t, attended by all the characters, except Chamont and the Chaplain.</P>
<P>Our young &s;oldier's phra&s;e of addre&s;s to the cler|gyman, &s;tiling him Sir Gravity, is rather an unpo|lite, ludicrous beginning of conver&s;ation; the in|tention of Chamont evidently appears to be getting at the connection, if any, between his &s;i&s;ter and Ca&s;talio; however, not being an&s;wered &s;o fully, nor &s;o &s;oon as he wi&s;hes, he breaks out into the &s;quib and cracker &s;tile of pa&s;&s;ion, uttering &s;uch a train of ill-grounded, irrational, ungentleman-like abu&s;e, upon the clerical profe&s;&s;ion in general, as cannot be ju&s;ti|fied: however, the Chaplain, with a mo&s;t ea&s;y, con|de&s;cending nature, teeming with Chri&s;tian forgive|ne&s;s, for the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abu&s;e, tru&s;ts one he has great rea&s;on to think half a madman, with what at pre|&s;ent &s;eems e&s;&s;entially a &s;ecret, the marriage; this &s;oftens the frantic red-coat, and they part upon very obliging terms.</P>
<P>Ca&s;talio and Monimia now appear, he fully &s;a|tisfied with being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the idol of his heart; &s;he confe&s;&s;es &s;ome female fears from ominous circum&s;tances which &s;he has taken notice of; the&s;e apprehen&s;ions the bridegroom imputes to her tender nature, and urges a &s;peedy con&s;ummation of his bli&s;s. Here Polydore &s;hews him&s;elf, in the mean office of li&s;tening at the door: Monimia repre&s;ents &s;ome probable ill con&s;equences from her new hu&s;|band's coming to her bed chamber; however, be|ing clo&s;ely urged, &s;he gives him a &s;ignal to &s;ecure
<PB N="47" REF="53">
his admittance, and leaves him full of &s;atisfaction at the near completion of his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Polydore pre&s;enting him&s;elf, as if ca&s;ually, to the view of Ca&s;talio, and enquiring rather particularly after Monimia, he receives equivocal an&s;wers, which warm him into an ab&s;olute a&s;&s;ertion of his pa&s;&s;ion; he delivers him&s;elf with warmth and roughne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, while his eva&s;ive brother treats the mat|ter with affected indifference, and retires &s;neeringly: this behaviour, and his own licentious di&s;po&s;ition, prevail on Polydore to attempt a fatal impo&s;ition upon haple&s;s Monimia; having heard the appointed &s;ignal, he derives from thence &s;trong hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s; for the purpo&s;e of gaining time, he calls the page, and in&s;tructs him to attend Ca&s;talio while he is undre&s;&s;ing, and to &s;tay with him till he is gone to bed.</P>
<P>Matters thus di&s;po&s;ed, he approaches the chamber door, and by giving the &s;ignal, brings Florella to the window, who, &s;uppo&s;ing him Ca&s;talio, tells him Mo|nimia wonders at his <HI>unkind</HI> delay; tho' it is certain, as the &s;tage has not been vacant &s;ince &s;he went into her chamber, that &s;he has &s;carce had time to get un|dre&s;&s;ed; Polydore being admitted, with a very ful|&s;ome addre&s;s to his limbs, Ca&s;talio enters, followed by the page, whom he wants to get quit of; how|ever, true to his ma&s;ter's in&s;tructions, he per&s;everes in attendance, and obliges Ca&s;talio to hear &s;ome proofs of his archne&s;s, though not much to the cre|dit of his mode&s;ty; indeed our author &s;eems indu|&s;trious to call a blu&s;h upon the cheeks of delicacy as often as po&s;&s;ible; for he has made this page, which is generally repre&s;ented by a child, utter &s;ome very gro&s;s &s;entiments.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="54">Being at length di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, Ca&s;talio prepares for admittance to the man&s;ion of his joy; but, we think, if le&s;s had been given him to &s;ay, where ab|&s;olute &s;ilence &s;eemed &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, it would have been more con&s;onant to the nature of things. Up|on Florella's coming to the window, &s;uppo&s;ing him an impo&s;tor, &s;he treats him contemptuou&s;ly; this unexpected and provoking di&s;appointment of his hopes, enflames him &s;o much, that being ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, he throws him&s;elf upon the ground, ex|claiming again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed faithle&s;sne&s;s of Mo|nimia. Here Erne&s;to, an old &s;ervant, following, as he &s;ays, the &s;ound of &s;orrow, finds his young ma&s;ter in that melancholy &s;tate; with dutiful tenderne&s;s he &s;trives to &s;ooth his anxiety: on being told a woman is the cau&s;e, he declares a hatred of the &s;ex; this plea&s;es and flatters Ca&s;talio's perturbed &s;tate of mind, which cau&s;es him to exclaim in &s;evere, ge|neral terms, again&s;t women, from whom hi&s;torically he deduces &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;ignal mi&s;chiefs which &s;tand recorded; and with this rhap&s;odical, frenzied exclamation, he concludes the third act, in &s;uch a vociferous manner, as we might rea&s;onably expect to draw the whole family about his ears.</P>
<P>Aca&s;to, in &s;oliloquy, commences the fourth act, congratulating him&s;elf upon a re&s;toration of health, which he imputes to a happy re&s;t, and yet in the lines immediately after, complains of painful, omi|nous dreams, which are the bane, the imbitterers of nature's &s;econd fea&s;t, hag-riding his imagination all night; this is &s;o gro&s;s a contradiction, that it is wonderful how the author could fall into it. Polydore appearing, his father enquires for Ca&s;talio, and de&s;ires to meet him in the chapel;
<PB N="49" REF="55">
then in a &s;econd &s;oliloquy, &s;peaks of having heard Ca&s;talio's voice, during the night, conveying melan|choly &s;ounds.</P>
<P>Here Monimia approaches the old gentleman, who, after &s;ome kind ob&s;ervations upon her engag|ing looks, a&s;ks if &s;he has not heard &s;ome particular noi&s;e at night, being an&s;wered in the negative, he goes off to make further enquiry.</P>
<P>Our Orphan now left with Florella, declares ap|prehen&s;ion that her marriage is di&s;covered, which mu&s;t operate much to the di&s;advantage of her hu&s;|band; a kind of complaint is dropped at the bride|groom's cool method of taking leave in the morn|ing. Upon &s;eeing Ca&s;talio &s;he retires for &s;ake of meeting him in her chamber, we think it would have been more natural to have met his &s;teps half way: however, her leaving the &s;tage, affords him an opportunity of &s;peaking a very poetical, de&s;crip|tive &s;oliloquy; but a mo&s;t unnatural effu&s;ion for one under &s;uch a violent &s;tate of mental perturbation as Ca&s;talio is.</P>
<P>Monimia, who has but ju&s;t now retired, without any fre&s;h rea&s;on returns, and flies into the arms of her lord, as &s;he &s;hould have done before the une&s;&s;en|tial di&s;&s;ertation upon mountains, &s;hepherds, flocks, huts, birds, trees, &amp;c. which he has &s;o &s;ancifully entertained us with. Con&s;cious of her own inno|cence and virtuous affection, the reception &s;he meets naturally gives her a great &s;hock; and though we confe&s;s Ca&s;talio's provocation poignant, yet we think the author has con&s;ulted the progre&s;s of his plot more than nature, in making him vent his pa&s;|&s;ions &s;o outrageou&s;ly, without the minute&s;t article of enquiry why he was refu&s;ed admittance, as common
<PB N="50" REF="56">
&s;en&s;e might &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome cau&s;e for &s;uch refu&s;al, though not the real one; be it as it may, the bride|groom behaves in a mo&s;t tyrannical, unintelligible manner, and leaves his unhappy bride in a &s;tate of di&s;tracted grief, which circum&s;tance, however it may offend our rea&s;on, neverthele&s;s touches com|pa&s;&s;ion very feelingly.</P>
<P>Chamont, at this intere&s;ting, alarming cri&s;is en|ters, and finds his &s;i&s;ter in a &s;ituation of the mo&s;t affecting nature: he tenderly enquires the cau&s;e, and hearing Ca&s;talio named, very ju&s;tly takes fire, but &s;omewhat checks the tumult of his mind, till the whole affair is explained in very pathetic terms; upon which he flames irre&s;i&s;tably, and vows ven|geance on Ca&s;talio. This dreadful re&s;olution Mo|nimia is endeavouring to avert ju&s;t as Aca&s;to enters; Chamont's impetuo&s;ity cau&s;es him to a&s;&s;ail the old man in a blameable, though natural manner.</P>
<P>Giving the epithet of villain to one of his &s;ons, impre&s;&s;es the old man &s;trongly, and the &s;cene is agi|tated with warmth on both &s;ides; the firmne&s;s of age, and flightine&s;s of youth, are finely contra&s;ted; &s;oftening Chamont, and then precipitating him a|gain into ungovernable rage, are well imagined, well executed tran&s;itions; finely drawn, but rather too highly coloured for &s;trict adherence to nature. On being promi&s;ed ju&s;tice, the young &s;oldier retires, leaving Monimia to receive a very &s;tinging, though brief ob&s;ervation from Aca&s;to; importing, that her fir&s;t complaint &s;hould have been to him as a father, which might have prevented &s;uch dome&s;tic com|bu&s;tion.</P>
<P>Thus wretchedly circum&s;tanced, ill treated by her hu&s;band, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure ca&s;t off by his
<PB N="15" REF="57">
father, Monimia is left comfortle&s;s, amid&s;t a thou|&s;and apprehen&s;ions for both her brother and Ca&s;ta|lio, when Polydore comes in, and endeavours to &s;ooth the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fair one with tender expre&s;&s;ions; however, not being a very agreeable object, it is not likely his kindne&s;s &s;hould take the de&s;ired effect. Upon mentioning that he knows Ca&s;talio to be the cau&s;e of her &s;ighs and tears, and urging his own pa&s;&s;ion, Monimia reproaches him with having at|tempted to enter her chamber, under &s;emblance of his brother; upon which, with a degree of precipi|tate triumph, he not only avows the de&s;ign, but boa&s;ts his ab&s;olute &s;ucce&s;s. This rai&s;es a tremen|dous alarm in the heart of Monimia, and &s;he cau|tions him to avoid &s;uch a dreadful a&s;&s;ertion; how|ever, upon a clear, explicit declaration, of having pa&s;&s;ed the night in her bed-chamber, nature faints under &s;o violent a &s;hock, and Monimia is rendered for a moment in&s;en&s;ible of her horrid &s;ituation.</P>
<P>On the revival of her &s;en&s;es, &s;he breaks out into a general execration, and acquaints Polydore with the dreadful crime his precipitate inadvertence has hurried him into. Their intercour&s;e now takes the affecting turn of deep, mutual contrition, and pun|gent &s;orrow. One thought of Polydore's, which &s;ug|ge&s;ts murdering, if any, the fruit of their guilty joys, is dete&s;tably &s;hocking, and the more &s;o, as there is no rea&s;on for mentioning &s;uch a thing; and of all extravagant excur&s;ions of fancy which have offended critici&s;m and propriety, we know not one more hateful and unnatural, than Polydore's con|clu&s;ive &s;peech to the fourth act; the notion of witches, at any rate, is contemptible, but to intro|duce a picture of their noi&s;ome rendezvous, and to
<PB N="52" REF="58">
pre&s;ent them as feeding upon imps, fattened with the blood of babes, is as di&s;gu&s;tful as it is unnatural. The &s;tage has, we think, commendably &s;oftened this mo&s;t cen&s;urable pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The fifth act begins with Ca&s;talio lying on the ground, and, as we under&s;tand from his words, taking a view of deer which are pa&s;&s;ing; from whence he draws a &s;hort compari&s;on between the tranquil &s;tate of brutality, and the perturbed &s;itua|tion of rational beings. His &s;oliloquy ends with a very gro&s;s and &s;uperfluous remark: being called upon by his father, he enquires who is &s;o wretched but to name him; Aca&s;to's de&s;ign is that of a &s;en|&s;ible, benevolent parent, to reconcile the breach be|tween his &s;on and daughter-in-law; this de&s;irable point he urges warmly, and in&s;i&s;ts upon Ca&s;talio's conde&s;cending to a per&s;onal interview with Moni|mia, but cannot prevail. While they are in debate, Chamont appears, full fraught with injuries: Ca&s;|talio having heard the rough treatment his father has received from the young &s;oldier, is prepared to meet him on the mo&s;t de&s;perate terms; from mu|tual heat, and aggravating expre&s;&s;ions, a fatal deci|&s;ion &s;eems impending, the fearful effects of which are prevented by Aca&s;to's manly, &s;pirited interpo|&s;ition, and the timely appearance of Serina; how|ever, the &s;torm &s;eems to be lulled only for the pre|&s;ent, and the young men part on very angry terms. Aca&s;to here again renews his &s;uit, in favour of Mo|nimia, but without effect, till Florella enters with a pathetic account of her di&s;tre&s;s, and an urgent &s;oli|citation to &s;ee Ca&s;talio; this melts all his obdurate re&s;olves, and he hurries off to &s;ooth her angui&s;h. To &s;ay truth, he has &s;hewn him&s;elf more than &s;uffi|ciently
<PB N="53" REF="59">
inexorable for any provocation he has re|ceived, as the material circum&s;tance, of which &s;he is innocent, as yet remains unknown to him.</P>
<P>Monimia enters in &s;oliloquy, &s;eeking di&s;tractedly for Ca&s;talio, who comes on with all the ardor of re|vived pa&s;&s;ion, with every trace of re&s;entment &s;unk in oblivion.</P>
<P>Throughout this whole &s;cene there is an affecting pathos of expre&s;&s;ion, and con&s;iderable variety of action: Monimia hints unintelligibly &s;ome hidden cau&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ome un&s;een bar to the happine&s;s he aims at, and which he &s;uppo&s;es re&s;ts totally in her power. Grief and tenderne&s;s agitate him al|ternately, in a pitiable manner; at length Monimia leaves him without any explanation, an entire prey to doubts and fears.</P>
<P>At this gloomy period, upon this perilous tem|per of mind, Polydore enters, meditating on his own deplorable condition, which ju&s;tly makes him weary of life. The brothers encounter, Ca&s;talio enquires for Monimia, of whom Polydore gloomily affects a total ignorance; the word friend&s;hip being mentioned, Po|lydore catches at it, and throws out terms of &s;u&s;picion again&s;t Ca&s;talio; this urges the latter to a very af|fectionate declaration, and a &s;olicitation of comfort from the former, who intimates he has none to give. At length, Ca&s;talio enters upon a perplexed expla|nation of his marriage with Monimia, this cau&s;es Polydore to break into violent re&s;entment, which he gives &s;cope to in very gro&s;s terms: Ca&s;talio mani|fe&s;ts an extraordinary &s;pirit of forbearance; till, at la&s;t, being repeatedly &s;tigmatized as a coward, he draws his &s;word, upon which Polydore voluntarily ru&s;hes, to end a being which the effects of his own
<PB N="54" REF="60">
intemperance has rendered hateful to him. Upon Ca&s;talio's perceiving the &s;ituation his brother is in, all enmity vani&s;hes, and he laments the circum&s;tance which occa&s;ions Polydore to own his de&s;ign, to ex|plain the occa&s;ion. Monimia comes in upon this blood-&s;tained &s;cene, and &s;eeing the fatal circum|&s;tance which has happened, very ju&s;tly &s;tarts at the object. Ca&s;talio now viewing her as an object of &s;ingular guilt, &s;eems to threaten death; the expiring brother exculpates our unfortunate orphan in &s;uch a manner, that her unhappy hu&s;band perceives his di&s;|&s;imulation has been the original and ultimate cau&s;e of &s;uch &s;ad di&s;a&s;ters. Thus the plot comes to a mo&s;t intere&s;ting cri&s;is; Ca&s;talio becomes convinced of his own mi&s;conduct, and its fatal effects; while the inno|cent object of his rage and ill-treatment dies of poi&s;on, admini&s;tered by her&s;elf&mdash;A circum&s;tance we could have wi&s;hed our author to avoid, as &s;uicide &s;hould never be rendered pitiable.</P>
<P>Chamont immediately enters upon the decea&s;e of his &s;i&s;ter, fraught with the &s;ame vindictive rage as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him when la&s;t he left the &s;tage; but the ir|re&s;i&s;table tempe&s;t in Ca&s;talio's brea&s;t overbears him, till that unhappy victim of violent love and a weak mind, falls by his own hand. Polydore, who has lingered much too long on the &s;tage, yields his breath on Ca&s;talio's receiving the fatal &s;tab, and Ca&s;talio him&s;elf expires in a few lines, lamenting the &s;orrows which are brought upon his aged, kind father, and bequeathing his birthright to Chamont; who, after being a madman through all preceding &s;cenes where he has been concerned, immediately commences morali&s;t, and concludes the piece with a mo&s;t uncomfortable, vague and indefen&s;ible po&s;i|tion,
<PB N="55" REF="61">
that heaven maintains its empire by the mi&s;e|ries of mankind; whereas, we think, that the boun|ties and indulgences of providence, as they are much more exten&s;ive and worthy of divine power, &s;o they are infinitely a greater proof of it than tho&s;e di&s;agreeable, painful circum&s;tances, which the fol|lies and vices of mankind bring upon them&s;elves and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>In this tragedy we meet with many &s;trokes of pe|culiar &s;en&s;ibility; the &s;tory affords great opportu|nity for &s;uch, and yet the plot not only abounds with improbable irregularities, but is originally founded upon a mo&s;t gro&s;s and offen&s;ive principle; every idea of delicacy is ca&s;t a&s;ide, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s made the vehicle of melting impre&s;&s;ions; the &s;tage is &s;o incumbered with blood and death, that it becomes a &s;pectacle of real horror; the characters give us in general a very unfavourable idea of human nature; however, they are well &s;upported, according to the principles on which each appears to be founded.</P>
<P>Aca&s;to is an elderly nobleman, who has pa&s;&s;ed part of his life in a &s;tate of honourable activity; but being like many other worthy objects, neglected to make way for the preferment of more pliant, courtly tem|pers, now ab&s;tracts him&s;elf from all public concerns, and means to enjoy the comforts of dome&s;tic felicity. He appears to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good under&s;tanding, and a liberal mind; to his children a tender parent, to Monimia, as the daughter of a decea&s;ed friend and dependent on him, a kind protector. No great requi&s;ites are wanting to render him re&s;pectable in repre&s;entation, yet have we never &s;een any performer equal to our idea of this character; Me&s;&s;rs. SPARKS and BERRY, were neare&s;t the mark. Me&s;&s;rs. BRANS|BY
<PB N="56" REF="62">
and GIBSON, are at pre&s;ent very poor apologies for it. Whatever ideas theatrical gentlemen may form of Aca&s;to, we are perfectly of opinion, that he merits a capital actor to give him due con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Ca&s;talio is di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;oft, amorous turn of mind, who&s;e want of generous, open confidence, cau&s;es all the di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances which hap|pen; he is much more an object of partial pity than e&s;timation. With re&s;pect to his brother, he certain|ly acts a mean, eva&s;ive part; and with Monimia, he alternately &s;hews him&s;elf a fool and a tyrant: his circum&s;tances give great &s;cope for the exertion of various capital powers, which were amazingly well &s;upplied in the elegant figure, bewitching voice, and excellent acting of Mr. BARRY; who, in this part, defied the &s;evere&s;t critici&s;m, and ju&s;tly claimed what he always obtained, the warme&s;t applau&s;e that en|chanted feelings could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Mr. ROSS, tho' much fainter, has yet con&s;iderable merit; he figured the part well, his voice had the merit of harmony, but wanted extent of power for the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned &s;cenes. Mr. REDDISH is hea|vy and inadequate through the whole; neither his love, grief nor rage, keeps pace with the author's meaning. Mr. SMITH's con&s;tant failing, &s;amene&s;s, lies remarkably heavy on him in this part; it is true, he ri&s;es above in&s;ipidity, but does not &s;trike out a gleam of leading merit. Mr. POWELL hit off the tender pa&s;&s;ages much better than any other com|petitor, except Mr. BARRY; but in the &s;cenes of mere dialogue, he fell very &s;hort of Mr. ROSS; who perhaps for characteri&s;tic ea&s;e and gentility in them &s;hould be placed fir&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="63">Polydore is bold, open, licentious, rather brutal, both in character and expre&s;&s;ion; ungenerous and ba&s;e in his conduct to Monimia to the la&s;t degree; an object of much di&s;like, and very little e&s;teem; de&s;pi&s;ed, or rather dete&s;ted in life, unpitied in his fall, more again&s;t the actor than for him.</P>
<P>Mr. SPARKS was the mo&s;t characteri&s;tic performer out of many that we have ob&s;erved; the &s;pirit and &s;ubtlety of this part, he marked with peculiar merit. We remember to have &s;een Mr. SHERIDAN make a mo&s;t lamentable attempt at this character, and are bold to &s;ay upon recollection, that except the bare meaning of tho&s;e words he uttered, the whole was &s;uch a piece of impotent, di&s;gu&s;tful performance, as &s;carce any actor of repute ever &s;hewed before or &s;ince. Me&s;&s;rs. CAUTHERLY and WROUGHTON are pretty equal competitors for the palm of in&s;ipidity; to &s;ay which is wor&s;t would puzzle the acute&s;t cri|tici&s;m, and imagination is almo&s;t at a lo&s;s to con|ceive the wretchedne&s;s of either.</P>
<P>Chamont, in our account of the piece, has been marked as an oddity, and an extraordinary one he really is, but well calculated to &s;hew an able actor advantageou&s;ly. The quickne&s;s and fire of look, as well as expre&s;&s;ion and ge&s;ture, which &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;h Mr. GARRICK from all his cotempo|raries, no where operate more happily than in Cha|mont; pa&s;&s;ions which are really ab&s;urd and laugha|ble, as the author has drawn them, are by him ren|dered re&s;pectable and &s;triking; the calmer pa&s;&s;ages he delivers with unequalled &s;en&s;ibility, and his tran|&s;itions to the impetuous ones are &s;o ma&s;terly, that all attempts to de&s;cribe his excellence mu&s;t injure it.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="64">It will perhaps &s;carcely be credited, yet is mo&s;t &s;olemnly true, that we have &s;een Mr. QUIN, when at lea&s;t &s;ixty years old, and of &s;uch corpulence as to weigh twenty &s;tone, roll on for the young Chamont, in a &s;uit of cloaths heavy enough for Othello; a pair of &s;tiff-topped white gloves, then only worn by at|tendants on a funeral, an old fa&s;hioned major wig, and black &s;tockings; yet odd as this external ap|pearance may &s;eem, his performance was not one jot le&s;s &s;o; and, without exaggeration, we may a&s;&s;ert, that there never was any thing &s;o like bur|le&s;que, except the thing it&s;elf, as this veteran's droni&s;h apology for the juvenile &s;oldier.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN&mdash; why, why did we ever meet him in this play, except for Aca&s;to? was untunably for|mal and &s;tiff in the mild &s;cenes, irk&s;omely boi&s;ter|ous in the impetuous ones; not a glimp&s;e of merit appeaved through the whole, except his de&s;cription of the witch, and the account of his father's inte|grity. Mr. HOLLAND would have been equally di&s;agreeable, but that his expre&s;&s;ion was more lively, and his powers, as well as figure, more adequate; though the buckram of affectation &s;tiffened him mo&s;t abominably.</P>
<P>The Chaplain is as well &s;upported by Mr. LOVE, as any audience can po&s;&s;ibly wi&s;h.</P>
<P>The page we have &s;een done extremely well by &s;everal different children, but apprehend, Mi&s;s ROSE, who played la&s;t &s;ummer at Mr. FOOTE's, with &s;o much and well de&s;erved applau&s;e, would from her diminitive &s;ize, archne&s;s of look, and peculiar &s;hrewd|ne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;urpa&s;s any who have come under our notice.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="65">Monimia is drawn a character of great e&s;timation, and touches the feelings of pity in a very peculiar manner; her attachment to Ca&s;talio is open, gene|rous and con&s;tant; in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, it is true, &s;he di&s;covers a temper bordering on the violent; how|ever, &s;he undergoes circum&s;tances of peculiar pro|vocation, and is at la&s;t thrown into a mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate. It is hard to &s;ay how any human mind, e&s;|pecially one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;ibility, could &s;u&s;tain &s;o di&s;tracting a &s;ituation; but we could heartily wi&s;h that the author had found a more ju&s;tifiable method of relea&s;ing her from care, than by the act of &s;uicide, which takes off much from the regard &s;he has ob|tained, and manife&s;tly ca&s;ts a heavy &s;hade on her fall; her taking poi&s;on in &s;uch violent perturbation of mind, may be authorized by too many examples in real life, and therefore is not unnatural, but it &s;hould have been avoided, as not only highly im|moral, but irrational al&s;o.</P>
<P>The opinion we gave of Mrs. CIBBER and Mrs. BELLAMY, in Belvidera, may nearly point out the merits of tho&s;e ladies in this character; equal in the error of &s;ing-&s;ong, we think the latter looked and &s;poke all pa&s;&s;ages of amorous feeling, much better than the former; but in rage and di&s;tre&s;s Mrs. CIBBER was no doubt equal to every degree of con|ception. In the fir&s;t, &s;econd and third acts, we have very little doubt of Mrs. BELLAMY's &s;uperiority: In the fourth and fifth, her great competitor, or ra|ther example, took the lead con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>Mrs. YATES, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of powerful and plea&s;ing talents for tragedy, has a certain &s;tudied haughtine&s;s of look, and &s;tiff mechani&s;m of ge&s;ture, very ill adapted to &s;uch a per&s;onage as Monimia;
<PB N="60" REF="66">
therefore we never ta&s;ted critical plea&s;ure from her performance of it; the mode being much better &s;uited to Roxana than our orphan.</P>
<P>Mrs. BARRY rather overfigures Monimia, but by uniting every excellence of the two fir&s;t mentioned ladies, except Mrs. CIBBER's amazingly de&s;criptive countenance, wherein every feature &s;poke; &s;he ap|pears to us the be&s;t in our recollection. We have &s;een Mrs. W. BARRY make &s;uch a &s;hift with the part as might do well enough on a country &s;tage, but mu&s;t be very in&s;ipid upon a Theatre Royal. Mi&s;s MILLER, who appeared at Covent Garden la&s;t winter in Monimia, has agreeable capabilities; but, as we apprehend, will never become a capital, &s;tand|ing di&s;h for critici&s;m to fea&s;t upon.</P>
<P>Serina being merely introduced to give Chamont a &s;weet-heart, and Florella to joke upon the di&s;ap|pointment of Ca&s;talio, they cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed of &s;ufficient note to fix any actre&s;s in remembrance; therefore we &s;hall pa&s;s them without further remark.</P>
<P>After admitting much of the pathos in this tra|gedy, &s;o much as even to render it a good acting piece, we are again to complain of gro&s;s licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, without the &s;hadow of a moral; wherefore we deem it highly cen&s;urable, and &s;incerely lamenting &s;uch a vile pro&s;titution of OTWAY's ma&s;terly talents, mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h it bani&s;hed by general con&s;ent, both from the clo&s;et and the &s;tage.</P>

<HEAD>The LAME LOVER. A COMEDY by Mr. FOOTE.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we inve&s;tigate the comedy now in view, we hope our readers will concur in opi|nion, that as the author of it is at pre&s;ent living, and has had heavy charges of per&s;onality in characters laid again&s;t him, it may be an e&s;&s;ential point of that impartiality we profe&s;s, to take a &s;hort view of the comic Mu&s;e's prerogative; and having e&s;tabli&s;hed her power within due, that is &s;alutary limits, a fair trial of the modern Ari&s;tophanes may en&s;ue.</P>
<P>We fir&s;t then lay it down for an irrefragable prin|ciple, that as &s;atire could have no ju&s;t exi&s;tence without vices and follies, all knaves and fools, of whatever country or denomination, are the natural, lawful game of comedy, general ideas of both may be &s;truck out to the proper ends of amu&s;ement and in&s;truction; but how faint are the effects of &s;uch compared with tho&s;e where individuals have &s;at for a well drawn picture? but then, &s;ay &s;ome per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of fal&s;e delicacy, is it not cruel to render any particular character laughable or obnoxious? to this we readily an&s;wer, that it is really nature or habit, not the &s;atiri&s;t, that furni&s;hes the cau&s;e of &s;uch effects. For in&s;tance, a printer, with one leg, could never have been rendered the butt of ridicule, if a coxcomical vanity of appearing quite the fine gentleman, and a wit, with intellects very little a|bove

common &s;en&s;e, had not marked him out as a character of ri&s;ibility. If &s;uch a per&s;onage as Cad|wallader ever lived, of which there is no doubt, could there be richer or more de&s;irable food for ge|nius to fea&s;t on? his convul&s;ed motion is not the foundation of the mirth he occa&s;ions, his boa&s;ted courage, learning, love for, and contempt of his wife, are &s;uch an olio of whim, that it would have been unpardonable in a writer of Mr. FOOTE's talents, not to have &s;acrificed him at the &s;hrine of &s;atire; however &s;ome may argue of cruelty, we a&s;&s;ert, that a dramatic author, as well as a critic, or judge on the bench, &s;hould be proof again&s;t all influence of affi|nity, intimacy, and partial connections. If you ap|ply the rod to a favourite child, it mu&s;t wound your feelings; but will you therefore refrain due cor|rection, and let him vegetate a wild, uncultivated, and perhaps poi&s;onous weed in the field of nature.</P>
<P>If then an acquaintance, or even a friend, who would perhaps take umbrage from advice in private, renders him&s;elf ridiculous or hateful, what more probable method of working a reformation, than by &s;hewing him a &s;trong reflecting mirror of his own defects or deformities? thus then, &s;uppo&s;ing the per&s;on aimed at takes it to him&s;elf, it bears a &s;trong probability of rendering him &s;ervice, though by a painful me|thod; if, as is mo&s;tly the ca&s;e, he joins the public laugh at his own picture, without knowing it, then there can be no cruelty, becau&s;e he &s;uffers no pain from it, indeed, if a man's circum&s;tances were in|vaded, or any branch of trade injured, except that mo&s;t pernicious one, methodi&s;t preaching, the ca&s;e would alter much, and even &s;trict truth, too pub|licly &s;poken, be cen&s;urable.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="69">That writer who comes neare&s;t the grand point of teaching us to <HI>know our&s;elves,</HI> is certainly the mo&s;t u&s;eful; and in the dramatic &s;phere, if he &s;uperadds peculiar humour, de&s;erves the greate&s;t &s;hare of prai&s;e.

<P>The LAME LOVER opens with Serjeant Circuit, we fear a very common character, and his daughter Charlotte, in warm conference about &s;ome gallant, which the former favours, but to whom Charlotte makes &s;ome &s;trong and &s;en&s;ible objections. The old &s;plitter of cau&s;es, as he is afterwards emphatically called, argues humorou&s;ly in quaint terms of litiga|tion, and endeavouring to explain the matter, by a ca&s;e in point, he puzzles him&s;elf in a very laughable manner, leaving the point more unintelligible than he found it.</P>
<P>Upon mention of Sir Luke Limp, the young lady &s;ugge&s;ts that he has other motives or attraction than his pretended pa&s;&s;ion for her, to bring him to the &s;erjeant's hou&s;e; upon being interrogated concern|ing her meaning, &s;he hints a view upon her mother-in-law, Mrs. Circuit; this, as &s;he cannot bring any po&s;itive proof, the lawyer treats with indifference, and imputes it to her jealou&s;y of the baronet. Here a de&s;cription of that gentleman drawn in lively terms occurs: &s;peaking of Sir Luke's being vain, even of defects, we meet this excellent remark;  <Q REND="inline">"To be &s;ure, &s;u&s;taining unavoidable evils with con&s;tancy, is a certain &s;ign of greatne&s;s of mind; but then, to derive vanity from a misfortune, will not, I am afraid,

With the&s;e preparatives he enters, full of vivacity, loquacity, and &s;elf-opinion; his very out&s;et, de&s;cribing his companions, and the new chri&s;tening of Charlotte, as he calls it, has a &s;trong ze&s;t of humour. Upon the lawyer's ob&s;erving that Sir Luke is nothing wor&s;e for the lo&s;s of a leg, our whim&s;ical baronet turns his misfortune to advantage, by ob&s;erving, that a fal&s;e limb is free from all the apprehen&s;ions of injury and &s;en&s;ations of pain, which commonly attend a real one; there is &s;omething extremely whim&s;ical in his remarks upon what he calls the redundancies of human nature, and his challenging the hot-headed Swi&s;s to run corking pins into the calves of their legs, is not only laughable from the oddity of idea, but a ju&s;t and &s;evere &s;arca&s;m a|gain&s;t boa&s;ters of courage and &s;toici&s;m.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant here enters with Sir Gregory Goo&s;e's complimentary invitation to Sir Luke, who men|tions a previous engagement; but, upon hearing that Sir Greg. is returned a member of parliament, he throws a&s;ide his promi&s;e to Alderman Inkle, and complies with the reque&s;t of his brother baronet. In a very &s;hort &s;pace the footman returns with a letter, which proves to be a &s;olicitation of Sir Luke's company from Lord Brentford; this occa&s;ions an embarra&s;&s;ment, how to get off with Sir Greg. but he &s;ends an apology for that purpo&s;e. Charlotte
<PB N="65" REF="71">
takes notice how the gradations of rank mu&s;t give way to each other; upon which, Sir Luke, by way of defence, pays &s;ome compliments to the attractive qualifications, e&s;pecially the wit of Lord Brentford, of which &s;ome very laughable proofs are given; &s;uch as taking ready furni&s;hed lodgings, and hiring a coach by the month to evade a late act, which li|mits privilege, al&s;o paying his debts alphabetically; nothing can be more whim&s;ically plea&s;ant than the &s;tory of his lord&s;hip and the coachmaker.</P>
<P>Upon Serjeant Circuit's appearing loth to part with Sir Luke, the loquacious baronet enumerates &s;everal curious engagements which call for his im|mediate attention. As he is going off, the &s;ervant returns in violent ha&s;te, with compliments from a duke; this puts Sir Luke into an irre&s;i&s;table flutter; his promi&s;es to Sir Greg and Lord Brentford throw him into great perplexity; but being informed that the duke is waiting for him in his <HI>own coach,</HI> with the <HI>coronets</HI> on, every idea of his other friends is &s;a|crificed, and he frames a mo&s;t extraordinary excu&s;e for Lord Brentford, no le&s;s than his being rendered incapable of attending, as two bailiffs had arre&s;ted and carried him into the Borough.</P>
<P>Mrs. Circuit finding upon her entrance that Sir Luke is gone, throws out &s;ome oblique hints as if her ab&s;ence had ha&s;tened his departure. The &s;er|jeant mentioning that he had been &s;olicited to attend King&s;ton a&s;&s;izes, for one of the judges, a&s;ks if his going will be agreeable to his lady, who &s;eems well plea&s;ed at the idea of getting rid of him for a little time. The name of his &s;on Jack occurring, Mrs. Circuit objects to the lad's being brought up to the bar, and gives it as her opinion, that a commi&s;&s;ion

in the army would enliven his natural &s;tupidity with a little fire; to which the &s;erjeant makes this very pregnant reply,  <Q REND="inline">"True, love; and a knowledge of the law, may'nt be ami&s;s to re&s;train his fire a little."</Q> Where this excellent &s;troke points it is needle&s;s to explain.</P>

<P>Act the &s;econd begins with the &s;erjeant and his hopeful &s;on Jack; Mr. Fairplay, an attorney, is in|troduced, who recommends the ca&s;e of one Mr. Woodford to the &s;erjeant, who, after &s;ome interro|gations and doubts, de&s;ires Fairplay to call on him &s;ome other time.

humour; particularly the ca&s;e of the cow, which, however ludicrous it may &s;eem, certainly gave a hint of the mo&s;t &s;erious importance for pre&s;ervation of that worthy gentleman who was tried lately for &s;et|ting his hou&s;e on fire; who&s;e acquittal depended upon &s;omething extremely &s;imilar to the &s;hrewd a&s;&s;er|tion, that though cattle may be cows, it by no means follows that cows mu&s;t be cattle.</P>
<P>After the &s;erjeant's departure for King&s;ton, Char|lotte enters, for whom Jack has a letter from young Woodford which he delivers, and recommends to his &s;i&s;ter's notice, with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of boyi&s;h humour; upon reading the tender epi&s;tle, Char|lotte di&s;claims all knowledge of its author.</P>
<P>After Jack has exerted his &s;imple eloquence in favour of Woodford, and prevailed upon his &s;i&s;ter to give &s;ome gleam of hope, Mrs. Circuit enters, and di&s;mi&s;&s;es both the brother and &s;i&s;ter from her pre&s;ence; then enquires after a letter or me&s;&s;age, and orders a collation for &s;ome company &s;he expects to be got ready. Being alone, &s;he meditates on her &s;ituation as candidate to be a member of the female coterie, and throws out &s;ome curious remarks on the di&s;po&s;ition of time among&s;t fine ladies. In the mid&s;t of a mo&s;t plea&s;ing reverie, Betty brings on a letter, which being opened with great eagerne&s;s, un|folds the lamentable chance of having lo&s;t the very intere&s;ting election; this &s;o much overpowers her agitated &s;pirits that &s;he faints, a circum&s;tance which nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ions much bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion; in the mid&s;t of it Sir Luke enters, and exerts all his care to recover the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed lady. This being ef|fected, the &s;ervants are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and Mrs. Circuit de&s;ires the knight to read the letter, which he does,
<PB N="69" REF="75">
and at the bottom finds what he thinks a circum|&s;tance of great comfort, viz. that &s;he has had &s;ixteen almonds, and but two rai&s;ins again&s;t her. This &s;cene is ju&s;tly and plea&s;antly pointed at an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment ridiculous to the highe&s;t degree, which has been &s;ugge&s;ted and countenanced by &s;ome ladies of leading fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Upon the appearance of Colonel Secret and Mrs. Simper, who mention Mrs. Circuit's di&s;appoint|ment, &s;he affects great indifference, and declares, that the matter has happened entirely through her own de&s;ign, then invites her gue&s;ts to the collation in another room; this makes room for Jack and Woodford, the former Introduces the latter to his &s;i&s;ter's room, and then returns to keep watch; his &s;oliloquy is fraught with real humour, ari&s;ing from very plea&s;ant and characteri&s;tic tran&s;itions: while he is making ob&s;ervations Betty, the maid, &s;urprizes him, and &s;eeing young Woodford in Charlotte's room, declares &s;he will acquaint the &s;erjeant; this alarms Jack, who endeavours to di&s;&s;uade her, but finds &s;ome difficulty, as Mi&s;s has offended Betty by mentioning her drums. Some good &s;trokes are thrown out again&s;t the ignorant vanity of &s;ervants apeing the extravagancies of their ma&s;ters and mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es; when this pert chamber-maid is called off, by the ringing of her mi&s;tre&s;s's bell, Woodford re-enters, and is que&s;tioned by Jack, in low terms, whe|ther he has gained his &s;uit, to which replying, that he thought it too hard to pre&s;s for &s;entence &s;o &s;oon, Jack reproves his diffidence, and is going to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when &s;ight of his father frights them into Charlotte's chamber again.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="76">At the beginning of the third act, Sir Luke, &amp;c. are di&s;covered at the collation, and a very entertain|ing burle&s;que upon the di&s;jointed nothingne&s;s of polite chit-chat en&s;ues; at length the &s;erjeant being mentioned, Sir Luke offers to introduce him, which &s;urprizes Mrs. Circuit, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es him at King|&s;ton. The baronet, with a degree of whim very &s;uitable to his character, brings forward a block with one of the lawyer's large whigs on it, this Mrs. Circuit &s;alutes, as the image of her lord: be|ing determined to have him at table as an object of mirth, &s;he goes off for a &s;erjeant's gown; the mock figure being thus complete, Sir Luke's prolific brain &s;ugge&s;ts another &s;troke of humour, which is to plead a cau&s;e before the &s;erjeant, as an indulgence to his darling pa&s;&s;ion. No &s;ooner &s;aid than agreed to, when the two ladies and gentlemen go off to get proper habiliments. While they are preparing Serjeant Circuit comes on, ruminating on the hint Charlotte had given him, re&s;pecting Sir Luke and her mother-in-law; &s;eeing the collation, he is re&s;olved to par|take, and for that purpo&s;e going to a chair, he &s;ees his own &s;imilitude at the head of the table, which at fir&s;t &s;tartles and puzzles him to know the meaning; however, he puts the favourable con&s;truction upon it, that his wife's &s;ingular regard makes her &s;tudious of having &s;omething in his ab&s;ence to re&s;emble him; happy in this idea, he &s;its down and enjoys the wine, &amp;c. very freely: approaching feet interrupt his jollity, when looking out, and &s;eeing the appearance of four lawyers, he determines to &s;ecrete him&s;elf, and &s;lips to that end under the gown, with this very poignant remark, that it is not the fir&s;t fraud it has covered.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77">Preparatory to the pleading, Sir Luke throws out &s;ome cutting &s;arca&s;ms again&s;t perver&s;ions of law, by fir&s;t ob&s;erving, that they are only to debate upon the cutting down of a tree, without taking any no|tice of a borough, which is the real point in di&s;pute; and next by expre&s;&s;ing his hopes that none of his brethren have <HI>touched</HI> on <HI>both</HI> &s;ides.</P>
<P>Mrs. Circuit, as coun&s;el for Hob&s;on, the plaintiff, with mo&s;t loquacious volubility and abundance of circumlocution, not only &s;tates but illu&s;trates the ca&s;e; &s;he de&s;cribes the utility and beauty of the plumb-tree in que&s;tion, giving al&s;o an account of the clande&s;tine and injurious manner in which it has been cut down; from thence deducing in the u&s;ual manner, &s;trong hope that a verdict will be found for the plaintiff.</P>
<P>Sir Luke, for the defendant ri&s;es, and after &s;ome imagined interruptions, proceeds with much formal pompo&s;ity, to &s;et a&s;ide his antagoni&s;t's arguments, which he traces with &s;trict method, pur&s;uing, as he phra&s;es it, the probable and the po&s;itive proofs, both which he controverts in a very ludicrous manner; contending, that the plumb-tree which has been re|pre&s;ented as &s;o beautiful and &s;o excellent, was not only leafle&s;s, limble&s;s, and almo&s;t lifele&s;s, but al&s;o of an impoveri&s;hed &s;pecies, far inferior to &s;everal other he mentions. Here, by a kind of in&s;tinct, the real &s;erjeant bolts forward, and mentions green-gages as of &s;uperior quality; the &s;ight of &s;o unexpected a per&s;on concludes the trial, and leaves only the &s;er|jeant, with his friend Sir Luke, on the &s;tage; the former has been &s;o delighted with the pleadings, that in full glee he in&s;i&s;ts upon the baronet's &s;itting down and taking a chearful gla&s;s with him; both of the&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="78">
gentlemen being previou&s;ly flu&s;tered, a few bum|pers force the flow of &s;pirits to intoxication.</P>
<P>Arrived at this critical point, Sir Luke begins to unbo&s;om him&s;elf, and by very natural degrees for &s;uch a &s;ituation, furni&s;hes the &s;erjeant with very in|telligible hints of his intimacy with Mrs. Circuit: the &s;erjeant for &s;ome time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a particular portion of confident &s;tupidity, forms no clear idea of what he hears; at la&s;t, having &s;uch an explana|tion as he cannot po&s;&s;ibly re&s;i&s;t or mi&s;apprehend, he breaks out in terms of high re&s;entment again&s;t his wife, but thoroughly exculpates Sir Luke, and a mo&s;t whim&s;ical compact of friend&s;hip is entered into by the offender and offended; when Mrs. Circuit, who, as it appears, has been li&s;tening to this curious tete-a-tete, bolts in, and rates her intimidated, cre|dulous hu&s;band mo&s;t &s;oundly; upon which, he joins her in attacking Sir Luke, and bids him with terms of infamy get out of his hou&s;e: thus Sir Luke is driven into Charlotte's chamber, whence his appearance draws Jack, Woodford, and the young lady; fre&s;h &s;urprize here breaks in upon the &s;erjeant, however, upon recognizing Woodford, and hoping that the young man's view of fortune may be at|tainable, hearing from Sir Luke al&s;o that the &s;tory of his wife was to prevent the baronet's marriage with his daughter, matters &s;ub&s;ide into a tolerable calm, and the comedy ends with a promi&s;e of con|jugal obedience from the &s;erjeant to his dear, injured lady.</P>
<P>Having thus traced the &s;cenes and general pur|port of this piece, we are now to con&s;ider the uni|ties and the characters, in a more di&s;tinct manner; as to the former, Ari&s;totle him&s;elf could not have
<PB N="73" REF="79">
wi&s;hed them more &s;trictly adhered to, as to the latter they have con&s;iderable force, variety and novelty: the moral of this piece is rather complicate than &s;ingle; more deducible from the per&s;onages of the drama di&s;tinctly, than the general action.</P>
<P>In the Serjeant we find abu&s;e of law and equity &s;atirized with a very keen and plea&s;ant degree of humour; in his wife the fal&s;e &s;pirit of wi&s;hing to join in even the vicious di&s;&s;ipations of high life is laughably ridiculed; and by Sir Luke Limp, bu&s;t|ling, talking in&s;ignificance, united to a ridiculous affection for titles, is admirably &s;et forth. The dialogue of this piece is lively, pregnant and ter&s;e, to a con&s;iderable degree of excellence.</P>
<P>Serjeant Circuit is one of tho&s;e dete&s;table practi|tioners who &s;tudy the wrong &s;ide of law more than the right, and prefer perver&s;ion to ju&s;tice; as know|ing, according to an ob&s;ervation in this comedy, that a bad cau&s;e is more profitable than a good one; he is a knave in &s;ociety, yet credulous and a dupe to his wife; an admirer of Sir Luke's oddi|ties, which he mi&s;takes for wit, humour, &s;pirit and politene&s;s. This character is drawn with great abi|lity, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a kind of dry, intricate plea&s;antry, &s;omewhat difficult to hit off &s;ucce&s;sfully; notwith|&s;tanding which Mr. VANDERMERE gave us con&s;i|derable &s;atisfaction; and we doubt whether his per|formance of the Serjeant would be mended by any gentleman of either hou&s;e, unle&s;s Mr. YATES un|dertook him, who&s;e talents in &s;uch a vein of hu|mour are inimitable.</P>
<P>Sir Luke Limp is as laughable a compound as ever was mingled, made up of vanity, a&s;&s;urance and verbo&s;e nothingne&s;s, an ob&s;equious appendage of
<PB N="74" REF="80">
quality, and the humble &s;ervant of any body who will gratify his bu&s;y di&s;po&s;ition, by tran&s;acting any commi&s;&s;ion, however trifling or ridiculous; it is impo&s;&s;ible to read this part without ta&s;ting its high reli&s;hed ingredients, but we are very certain that the fine&s;t conception which has not been pre&s;ent at the animating action of Mr. FOOTE, mu&s;t have but a very faint idea of the baronet; his vivacity, variety, and force of expre&s;&s;ion through the whole, rather &s;urpa&s;&s;es than falls &s;hort of his u&s;ual excellence.</P>
<P>Jack Circuit is a well drawn piece of &s;hrewd &s;im|plicity, and enlivened by Mr. WESTON's peculiar humour, &s;o forceable to an audience, afforded rich food for laughter.</P>
<P>Mrs. Circuit is a mixture of vanity and weak|ne&s;s, which indeed are commonly united: to &s;ay that Mrs. GARDNER &s;hewed talents peculiarly hap|py, e&s;pecially in pleading the cau&s;e of the plumb-tree, is rather too faint prai&s;e for her ri&s;ing and ex|ten&s;ive merit.</P>
<P>Charlotte, the Serjeant's daughter, &s;eems to be a &s;en&s;ible young lady, and rallies her father in the fir&s;t &s;cene very agreeably; her &s;trictures upon Sir Luke Limp, and &s;ome other characters, di&s;cover di&s;cernment, under&s;tanding and humour. Mrs. JEWELL, who&s;e chief fault is a little want of e&s;&s;en|tial &s;pirit in expre&s;&s;ion, &s;upported the delicacy of this part in an agreeable manner.</P>
<P>The Chambermaid, who varies little from the general run of that ca&s;t, was well enough per&s;onated by Mrs. READ. The re&s;t of the characters are too incon&s;iderable to &s;ay more, than that the performers did them as well as could be expected.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="81">Upon the whole, this comedy, well acted, mu&s;t ever plea&s;e the general ear, but in the clo&s;et, if we judge right, it will only be acceptable to the intel|ligent few who can ta&s;te the poignancy of its &s;atire, and comprehend the bent of its humour; a &s;trong proof of &s;terling worth is its having every night ri&s;en above a capricious prejudice which attended the fir&s;t repre&s;entation.</P>

<HEAD>CYMBELINE. A TRAGEDY. Altered from SHAKESPEARE by GARRICK.</HEAD>
<P>NO author's works were ever inve&s;tigated by &s;o many, and &s;uch able commentators, in the &s;ame &s;pace of time as SHAKESPEARE's have been, within the la&s;t half century: in many places he &s;tands in|debted to their elucidations, in many others they have rather clouded than thrown light upon his ideas; &s;everal of his pieces have undergone advan|tageous alteration, and we repeat a wi&s;h already mentioned, that an edition of his plays, cleared from the abundance of &s;uperfluous, trifling, offen&s;ive, incoherent pa&s;&s;ages which incumber them, was pre|pared for, and given to the public.</P>
<P>Reconciling any play written by &s;o unparalelled a genius to the &s;tage, de&s;erves particular prai&s;e, as thereby public entertainment is much enriched, and noble flights of genius brought to a general know|ledge; the ta&s;k is arduous, and attended with much hazard; in this light we are to con&s;ider the piece before us, and &s;hould rather give Mr. GARRICK ge|neral approbation for his bold attempt, than point out indu&s;triou&s;ly the defects of his alteration; but how|ever goodnaturedly inclined the DRAMATIC CENSOR may be, yet &s;trict ju&s;tice, as heretofore, mu&s;t be aimed at, void of all prejudiced prai&s;e or cen&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="83">CYMBELINE opens with Pi&s;anio and a gentleman conver&s;ing on the &s;tate of affairs at court; from their conference we learn that the old monarch is unea&s;ily &s;ituated, as his daughter, by a former wife, whom he intended for the &s;on of a widow lately e&s;|pou&s;ed by him, has given her&s;elf in marriage to a per&s;on of much inferior rank, but great worth as a man: the account of Po&s;thumus's birth and qua|lifications prepare an audience well for admitting him to favour; mention is made of two of Cym|beline's &s;ons lo&s;t in their infancy, which as one of the characters ob&s;erves, is a circum&s;tance calculated to &s;train credibility.</P>
<P>The Queen entering with Po&s;thumus and Imo|gen makes fair-faced profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip to the young pair; but the prince&s;s rightly &s;ees through the thin veil of her hypocri&s;y, and tender|ly intimates it to her hu&s;band, who&s;e departure &s;he requires, yet pathetically laments; his return is af|fectionate. The royal &s;tep-dame re-enters, and &s;eems apprehen&s;ive of the king's &s;eeing Po&s;thumus, yet mentions a&s;ide her intention of bringing him to the view &s;he feigns to dread &s;o much; a ring and bracelet, as mutual remembrancers of affection are interchanged, with expre&s;&s;ions of delicate &s;oftne&s;s. Cymbeline's abrupt entrance and terms of reproach, hurry Po&s;thumus off the &s;tage; Imogen &s;u&s;tains many har&s;h terms from her enraged father, and the Queen gets her &s;hare for &s;uffering the interview with Po&s;thumus.</P>
<P>From Pi&s;anio, who was &s;ent to &s;ee his lord on board, we learn that he has &s;ailed; it appears to us, that the alterer of this play might, without throwing any weight on repre&s;entation, have fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="78" REF="84">
matter to give Pi&s;anio more probable time for what he de&s;cribes; what pa&s;&s;es between the prince&s;s and him re&s;pecting her hu&s;band's depar|ture is pathetically picture&s;que.</P>
<P>The Queen next appears, with Cornelius a phy|&s;ician, from whom &s;he receives a phial of &s;uppo&s;ed poi&s;on, which with mo&s;t murderous intention &s;he forces upon Pi&s;anio, under a ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, &s;oliciting him to influence his mi&s;tre&s;s Imogen in favour of her &s;on; this female mon&s;ter is truly of|fen&s;ive, and rather di&s;graceful to human nature; however, the feeling mind has a comfort in prophe|tically perceiving that her abominable de&s;igns are not likely to take effect; for Pi&s;anio, as well as the phy&s;ician, appears to have a right idea of her, and faithfully profe&s;&s;es attachment to his exiled ma&s;ter Po&s;thumus.</P>
<P>By the power of poetical magic we are in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly conveyed from the Engli&s;h court to Italy, without even the intervention of a chorus, which though an imperfect, is yet a plau&s;ible apology for &s;uch palpable breaches of time and place.</P>
<P>Philario, Jachimo, and a Frenchman&mdash;why was not the latter equipped with a name? pre&s;ent them|&s;elves; their conver&s;ation, which is expre&s;&s;ed in a cramp, ob&s;olete, quibbling &s;tile, turns upon and in favour of Po&s;thumus, who &s;hortly appears, and is recommended to a cordial intimacy with the other characters by Philario. A &s;ubject of debate ari&s;ing upon the qualifications of females, Jachimo ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf lightly, and Po&s;thumus warms into an elogium upon Imogen, without naming her; the oppo&s;ition of opinions at length increa&s;es &s;o much, that Po&s;thumus, we mu&s;t &s;ay very fooli&s;hly, enters
<PB N="79" REF="85">
into a wager upon the impracticability of Jachimo's obtaining any countenance from his wife. This point being agreed between the ab&s;urd gallant Ja|chimo, and the more ab&s;urd hu&s;band Po&s;thumus, we are brought to the conclu&s;ion of the fir&s;t act, by a forced, chimerical incident, &s;et forth in a &s;cene of quaint, unimportant expre&s;&s;ion, which cannot help the &s;peakers, nor plea&s;e a judicious audience, unle&s;s &s;upported by very agreeable capabilities.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act we find Imo|gen in &s;oliloquy upon her unhappy &s;ituation; after a few lines Pi&s;anio introduces Jachimo, as bringing letters from Po&s;thumus. By the by, courtly eti|quette is laid entirely a&s;ide, and &s;omething of a que&s;tion ari&s;es how a &s;tranger &s;hould gain &s;uch ready, cordial admittance to a prince&s;s, watched in all her motions, and labouring under the di&s;plea&s;ure of her royal father. However, the adventurous Roman was to be introduced, and SHAKESPEARE thought the manner of little importance, el&s;e by charging him with &s;ome commi&s;&s;ion from Rome, which might have been mentioned in the preceding &s;cene, Jachimo's journey would not have been founded upon &s;o romantic and improbable a crcum&s;tance as the wager alone, and his free acce&s;s to court would in &s;uch ca&s;e be very natural.</P>
<P>From the part of Po&s;thumus's note which Imo|gen reads, it appears, that he gives Jachimo's vil|lainous de&s;ign the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, by re|commending him to the lady's confidence in terms of very kind re&s;pect. The forward gallant, &s;truck with her beauty, and willing to make trial at once, arms him&s;elf with uncommon confidence, and begins his attack politically enough, by de&s;canting on the
<PB N="80" REF="86">
&s;uperior value of <HI>her</HI> charms, and the depravity of human nature, particularly in Po&s;thumus; who be|ing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch matchle&s;s excellence, can pro&s;|titute his attention and regard to objects of far le&s;s e&s;timation. There is art di&s;covered in this part of the &s;cene, and fancy gilds the conduct, but we think Imogen too tame, too dull of conception; and Ja|chimo &s;tands reprehen&s;ible for &s;everal very indeli|cate ideas, which we imagine the alterer of this play &s;hould have &s;oftened: how could delicacy let &s;lip?</P>

<P>Not one of the preceding pa&s;&s;ages has the lea&s;t gleam of poetical beauty, to apologize for ful&s;ome|ne&s;s; and to make a cha&s;te prince&s;s violate her own mode&s;ty, by mention of Roman &s;tews, though high|ly provoked, is a violent tre&s;pa&s;s upon decorum: the turn which Jachimo gives to his intention upon Imogen's re&s;entment, is well imagined, and has in action a very plea&s;ing effect.

and her immediately re&s;olving to place it in her <HI>bed-chamber,</HI> &s;till more &s;trange; this circum&s;tance we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e Jachimo has thought of previou&s;ly, in ca&s;e other means &s;hould fail, and the un&s;u&s;pecting prince&s;s meeting his de&s;ign half way, they part for the night in friendly terms.</P>
<P>Cloten, the Queen's &s;on, next enters, with two namele&s;s lords&mdash;Sure titles were very &s;carce when this tragedy was written, el&s;e SHAKESPEARE could never have incumbered it with &s;uch a parcel of a|nonymous peers. The &s;hallow-pated prince and his companions, are engaged in conver&s;ation upon a mo&s;t important quarrel, occa&s;ioned by Cloten's &s;wearing at a game of bowls. This &s;hort &s;cene ap|pears to be merely introduced as a &s;pecimen of this royal &s;prig. Upon Cymbeline's entering with the Queen, the ob&s;tinacy of Imogen is mentioned, but hopes given that when Po&s;thumus is a little worn from her recollection, &s;he &s;hall be di&s;po&s;ed of ac|cording to their wi&s;hes. Here intelligence is brought in of Caius Lucius's arrival, the Roman amba&s;&s;ador; Cymbeline propo&s;ing to give him audience on the morrow, retires.</P>
<P>Upon being told of Jachimo, as one of Leona|tus's friends, Cloten di&s;plays his mental abilities more at large &s;hews him&s;elf perfectly the incohe|rent, vain fool, and goes off, leaving one of the lords to de&s;cant on his weakne&s;s; and to tell in half a dozen &s;uperfluous lines, what even the dulle&s;t au|ditor is already &s;ufficiently acquainted with.</P>
<P>We are now conducted to the bed-chamber of Imogen, who expre&s;&s;ing wearine&s;s of reading, and ripene&s;s for &s;leep, &s;ends her attending woman to re&s;t, and with becoming piety commends her&s;elf to ce|le&s;tial
<PB N="82" REF="88">
protection. When &s;he is locked in the &s;oft &s;emblance of death, Jachimo ri&s;es from the trunk, in which he has lain concealed; and in a &s;peech of great variety, judgment, and poetical fancy, takes into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and remembrance, &s;uch &s;trong proofs of particular freedom and intimacy with the innocent prince&s;s, as cannot be controverted: this done, he retires to his covert.</P>
<P>What the &s;hort &s;ucceeding &s;cene between Cloten and lords is introduced for we cannot apprehend, unle&s;s to give an opportunity of clearing the bed, &amp;c. away. When the ma&s;querade is over&mdash; &s;uch an entertainment &s;eems rather improper for a morning&mdash;the &s;imple prince makes a very character|i&s;tic &s;peech, but we wi&s;h the phra&s;e, <HI>unpaved eunuch,</HI> had not been retained, under&s;tood it is &s;hamefully gro&s;s; if unintelligible, it de&s;erves the cen&s;ure of ob&s;curity. In his &s;oliloquy, previous to knock|ing at the prince&s;s's chamber-door, Cloten makes &s;ome remarks on the power and influence of gold, too &s;hrewd for &s;uch a &s;uperficial coxcomb; what pa&s;&s;es between him and the prince&s;s is &s;hallow fop|pery on his &s;ide, and peevi&s;h quibble on hers; the &s;pirit &s;he &s;hews in favour of Po&s;thumus, is indeed plea&s;ing and commendable; her mi&s;&s;ing the brace|let, and the contemptuous manner of leaving Clo|ten, conclude this act with tolerable propriety and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Now, by the irre&s;i&s;table power of dramatic con|juration, we are&mdash;hey!&mdash;pre&s;to! pa&s;s!&mdash;carried a|gain to Rome; where we find Philario and Po&s;thu|mus in conference. The latter drops a hint of his confidence in Imogen's invincible mode&s;ty; they then pa&s;s on to the &s;ubject of Caius Lucius's em|ba&s;&s;y;
<PB N="83" REF="89">
demanding tribute from Britain: this gives Po&s;thumus an opportunity of paying a pretty com|pliment to the courage and independant principles of his countrymen; to which the poet has added a forced panegyric upon living royalty; we call it forced, becau&s;e applied to Cymbeline, who from what is &s;aid of him in the beginning, and his con|duct through the piece, can &s;carcely be de&s;erving of this pa&s;&s;age, which we think inelegant as well as &s;uperfluous.</P>
<Q><L><HI>and more than that,</HI></L>
<L>They have a KING who&s;e love and ju&s;tice to them,</L>
<L><HI>May a&s;k and have</HI> their trea&s;ures and their blood.</L></Q>
<P>The fir&s;t hemi&s;tich in Italics, is not only impo|veri&s;hed but ungrammatical; the la&s;t faint and vulgar. Be&s;ides, bringing this trite, thread-bare compliment down to the pre&s;ent day, is taking a large jump over &s;eventeen centuries, to draw a &s;imi|litude by no means de&s;irable, in courtly terms of very &s;teril prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation of Po&s;thumus, on &s;eeing Jachimo, is a pretty fanciful apology for his miraculous &s;peed, and de&s;erves to be particularly noted,
<Q><L>The &s;wifte&s;t harts have po&s;ted you by land,</L>
<L>And winds of all the corners ki&s;s'd your &s;ails,</L>
<L>To make your ve&s;&s;el nimble.</L></Q></P>
<P>After peru&s;ing &s;ome letters delivered by Jachimo, Po&s;thumus enters directly upon the grand point, their wager. The &s;ubject is &s;ported with for a few &s;peeches, at length his rival enters upon proofs, which his good opinion waves, while the room, its furniture, and &s;uch dubious externals are mentioned.
<PB N="84" REF="90">
At length the bracelet is produced, which &s;trikes deep; however, the confidence of &s;incere love &s;ug|ge&s;ts that &s;he might have delivered it to Jachimo for Po&s;thumus's u&s;e: this gleam of comfort is clouded with one &s;hort que&s;tion, and the unhappy hu&s;band is harrowed with pa&s;&s;ion; when Philario intimating &s;he might have dropped the jewel, another pau&s;e of calmer rea&s;on en&s;ues, and he de&s;ires &s;ome corporal &s;ign; jealous relap&s;es neverthele&s;s break in even before the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial proof of di&s;loyalty is uttered. At length, when Jachimo mentions the mole, cinque &s;potted, upon Imogen's brea&s;t, her di&s;tracted lord is &s;o &s;welled with rage, as to be &s;carce|ly eapable of utterance, wherefore he is judiciou&s;ly carried off the &s;tage in a &s;tate of outrageous dubi|tation.</P>
<P>In the &s;oliloquy of Po&s;thumus, &s;ucceeding the la&s;t mentioned &s;cene, there are many fine opportu|nities afforded the able actor for &s;triking tran&s;itions of tones, look and ge&s;tures; and his virulent charge again&s;t the character of woman in general, empha|tically natural, for a man in his di&s;tracted &s;tate of provocation. But we mu&s;t lament retaining the following pa&s;&s;ages, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, that we have cen&s;ured &s;ome preceding ones:

<P>Cymbeline giving audience to the Roman am|ba&s;&s;ador, next &s;trikes our view; here we have in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly
<PB N="85" REF="91">
travelled, even without an act tune, from Italy to Britain. The notion of tribute is treated with contempt by Cymbeline, as echo of his Queen, and the worthy Cloten; who, to &s;ay truth, &s;teps in this &s;cene a little from him&s;elf, and &s;peaks with &s;ome degree of &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit, though in a quaint &s;tile.</P>
<P>Whether in a royal audience any per&s;ons are al|lowed to &s;peak but the monarch and the amba&s;&s;a|dor, we are not courtly enough to determine, but we apprehend not; if &s;o the Queen and her &s;on are improperly introduced, without any nece&s;&s;ity; for the matter in agitation might have been as well &s;ettled in their ab&s;ence, unle&s;s it was deemed nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;hew female influence over public councils.</P>
<P>Pi&s;anio &s;ucceeds the &s;cene of emba&s;&s;y, peru&s;ing a letter from Po&s;thumus, who, in the heat of jealous rage, has directed him to murder the &s;uppo&s;ed adul|tre&s;s Imogen; and for this de&s;perate purpo&s;e, has al&s;o &s;ent a letter to his un&s;u&s;pecting wi&s;e, advi&s;ing her that he is at Milford Haven, and wi&s;hes to &s;ee her there. Po&s;thumus here manife&s;ts a cruel, pre|meditate, vindictive, rather than generous &s;pirit of re&s;entment; an injured hu&s;band, with quick and warm feelings, might naturally &s;acrifice an abu&s;er of love and honour with his own hand; but to play the hypocrite, and become a political murderer, &s;a|vours much more of the Italian than Briti&s;h di&s;po&s;i|tion. However, &s;uch our author has drawn his hero; and Imogen, with all the eager impatience of a tender, loving wife, falls into the &s;nare, at once re|&s;olving to &s;et out with Pi&s;anio on the journey: if the tender-hearted dome&s;tic had not in his &s;oliloquy expre&s;&s;ed proper dete&s;tation of his ma&s;ter's bloody
<PB N="86" REF="92">
command, the andience mu&s;t here have been in a &s;tate of very painful apprehen&s;ion for Imogen; even as it is, our &s;u&s;pen&s;e mu&s;t be touched with tender concern.</P>
<P>Three fre&s;h characters now offer them&s;elves to view; Bellarius, an old man, and his two &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ons, Guiderius and Arviragus. After a &s;hort, &s;ig|nificant and poetical ori&s;on, applicable to their low|ly and ab&s;tracted &s;tate, the old man takes occa&s;ion to mention mountain &s;ports, and de&s;cants with a plea&s;ing, de&s;criptive degree of philo&s;ophical in|&s;truction, upon the elevated and humbler &s;tations of life, preferring the latter to the former; to this the youths reply, with a &s;en&s;ible activity of &s;pirit, that their years require a more bu&s;tling &s;phere: we could gladly tran&s;cribe this whole &s;cene as teeming with beauties, but &s;hall confine our&s;elves to the fol|lowing lines of Bellarius, in an&s;wer to what Arvira|gus and Guiderius have urged:
<Q><L>Did you but know the city's u&s;uries</L>
<L>And felt them knowingly&mdash;the art <HI>o'th</HI>' court</L>
<L>As hard to learn as keep, who&s;e top to climb</L>
<L>Is certain falling&mdash;the toil <HI>o'th</HI>' war,</L>
<L>A pain that only &s;eems to &s;eek out danger</L>
<L><HI>I'th</HI>' name of fame and honour; which dies <HI>i'th</HI>' &s;earch,</L>
<L>And hath as oft a &s;tanderous epitaph</L>
<L>As record of fair Act&mdash;</L>
<L>When a &s;oldier was the theme, my name</L>

<L>And left me bare to weather.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="93">We have marked &s;ome di&s;&s;onant contractions by italics in the preceding lines, which might and &s;hould have been &s;oftened.</P>
<P>Bellarius's account of his own exile and the young princes, is al&s;o very nervous and plea&s;ing; howe|ver, his &s;oliloquy is a palpable piece of explanatory information to the audience, and therefore cen&s;ura|ble: by it we find, that Bellarius, in revenge of his unju&s;t bani&s;hment, &s;tole Cymbeline's two infant &s;ons, and that they know nothing of their real birth, but imagine them&s;elves his children, as being brought up from two and three years old with him and his wife Euriphile.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding &s;cene we perceive Lucius taking leave of Cymbeline: after the amba&s;&s;ador's depar|ture, the old monarch enquires for Imogen, and complaining of her undutiful ab&s;traction, orders her into his pre&s;ence. The Queen faintly apologizes for her cold di&s;tance: on being informed that her chambers are all locked, Cymbeline confe&s;&s;es fear of what may be the meaning, and goes off; Cloten follows by the Queen's direction, while &s;he, in a &s;o|liloquy, expre&s;&s;es hope that Pi&s;anio has taken the quieting draught which &s;he gave him; as to Imo|gen, the hopeful &s;tep-mother encourages, flattering ideas, that de&s;pair or voluntary exile has put her &s;o effectually out of the way, as to leave the Briti&s;h crown entirely at her di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>Pi&s;anio, and his royal mi&s;tre&s;s, appear next, on their journey; a &s;trong perplexity of countenance, apparent in him, cau&s;es her to que&s;tion the rea&s;on of it. Being urged clo&s;e, he gives Po&s;thumus's letter into her hands with di&s;tre&s;sful reluctance; the paper, or rather the matter it contains, proves dag|gers
<PB N="88" REF="94">
to her &s;ight, and &s;he is &s;truck dumb, while Pi|&s;anio expre&s;&s;es warmly his invincible confidence and good opinion re&s;pecting her innocence.</P>
<P>The remaining part of this &s;cene is truly intere&s;t|ing; her &s;olicitation for fulfilling her hu&s;band's barbarous command, and the &s;truggles of Pi&s;anio, play powerfully on our feelings. His advice for her to join the Roman amba&s;&s;ador's train in di&s;gui&s;e, from thence deriving a probability of being near Po&s;thumus, is politic and humane. Imogen re|&s;olves to take his friendly coun&s;el, and being told he has garments fit for the purpo&s;e in their cloak bag, &s;he agrees to put on a ma&s;culine appearance.</P>
<P>The parting of Pi&s;anio from his royal mi&s;tre&s;s, his leavlng her to pro&s;ecute the propo&s;ed pilgrimage alone, though there may be &s;ome colour of rea&s;on for it, is rather indefen&s;ible; for we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that a faithful &s;ervant, who had dared to elope with her, would have continued his attachment, by partaking her di&s;gui&s;e and future fortunes; however, the poor prince&s;s is left to encounter alone a precarious and perilous adventure: Pi&s;anio pre&s;enting her with the phial he received from the Queen, as a benign and &s;pirit-cheering cordial, they &s;eparate and conclude the third act.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act, we find di&s;|appointed Cloten teeming with re&s;entment again&s;t Imogen. To him Pi&s;anio enters, and is accu&s;ed of abetting her elopement; urged with heavy threats, he delivers a paper to Cloten, importing, as he &s;ays, the &s;tory of her flight, but in reality calculated not only to deceive, but to lead him into danger. The royal gudgeon &s;wallows the bait laid for him, and bribing Pi&s;anio to become his friend, re&s;olves to
<PB N="89" REF="95">
pur&s;ue his mi&s;tre&s;s in a &s;uit of Po&s;thumus's cloaths; declaring al&s;o, an intention of killing that unfortu|nate man, upon meeting him at Milford Haven.</P>
<P>Imogen, now in boyi&s;h habiliments enters, and having lo&s;t her way, approaches the cave of Bella|rius; into which, after &s;trong marks of natural in|timidation, &s;he enters, to &s;eek or obtain &s;ome re|fre&s;hment to &s;upport langui&s;hing nature. The hunt&s;men returned from their &s;ports, Bellarius looks into his cave, and di&s;covers an unexpected gue&s;t, upon who&s;e beauty and innocence he pa&s;&s;es a kind and comprehen&s;ive compliment.</P>
<P>Upon being &s;een, Imogen enters from the cave, and prettily apologizes for her intru&s;ion, offering al|&s;o to pay for what &s;he has had. Inqui&s;ition being made concerning her name and de&s;tination, &s;he a&s;|&s;umes the title of Fidele, and &s;ays &s;he is following a relation bound to Italy from Milford. After this explanation, the good old man, ca&s;ting a&s;ide every con&s;ideration, but the plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from ho&s;|pitality, invites her to better cheer; and, as night is coming on, to take up her repo&s;e with them. Being pre&s;ented to her unknown brothers, a kind of in&s;tan|taneous, &s;ympathetic regard ri&s;es between them, and terms of mutual regard are exchanged; after which they retire into the cave.</P>
<P>Cloten next appears, upon the hunt for Po&s;thu|mus, and in his &s;oliloquy, declares terrible intentions again&s;t Imogen, when in his power; relying for ex|culpation from any crime he can commit, upon his mother's influence over Cymbeline. The fop and fool, in this adventure, &s;eems to have a &s;trong tinct|ure of the de&s;perado, which, according to our idea, is making him a kind of paradox in character.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="96">Upon returning from the cave, Imogen declares her&s;elf &s;ick, and is therefore left behind, while Bel|larius, &amp;c. go to the chace, one of the young princes having previou&s;ly offered to &s;tay with her as an a&s;|&s;i&s;tant: by way of re&s;torative, &s;he applies the cor|dial furni&s;hed by Pi&s;anio.</P>
<P>As the hunters are going off, Cloten enters, and from his u&s;ing the word runnagates, Bellarius ap|prehends a di&s;covery of their retreat; the old gen|tleman's immediate knowledge of this prince, after an ab&s;ence from court of twenty years, di&s;gui&s;ed too in Po&s;thumus's cloaths, is rather an encroachment on probability. Guiderius, by his own de&s;ire, is left to encounter Cloten, while his brother and &s;up|po&s;ed father, look out to &s;ee if he has any atten|dants; after a tart altercation, Guiderius and Clo|ten engage, fighting off the &s;tage. After a few in|tervening lines, the former returns victorious, ac|quainting Bellarius and Arviragus that he has con|quered, by the death of his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of Cloten's death, alarms Bel|larius with ju&s;t fears of fatal con&s;equences; Gui|derius re&s;olves upon committing Cloten's corp&s;e to a neighbouring creek of the &s;ea, and retires for that purpo&s;e; while Arviragus receives in&s;tructions to go and a&s;&s;i&s;t Fidele in preparing &s;ome provi&s;ions. The old man's &s;oliloquy, re&s;pecting his two adopt|ed &s;ons, is &s;o beautiful, that it would be an unpar|donable omi&s;&s;ion not to gratify the readers ta&s;te, by tran&s;cribing it.</P>
<Q><L>Oh thou godde&s;s!</L>
<L>Thou divine nature! how thy&s;elf thou blazone&s;t</L>
<L>In the&s;e two princely boys; they are as gentle</L>

<L>Civility not &s;een from other; valour</L>
<L>That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop</L>
<L>As if it had been &s;owed.</L></Q>
<P>After Guiderius has acquainted us with his com|mitting Cloten's body to the &s;tream, Bellarius is &s;truck with the &s;ound of &s;olemn mu&s;ic from his cave, occa&s;ioned, as we &s;oon learn, by Arviragus having di&s;covered Imogen in an apparent &s;tate of death. This circum&s;tance proves of much concern, interment is &s;poken of, and Bellarius, with true dig|nity of &s;pirit, re&s;olves that Cloten, though a foe, &s;hall in his remains be treated with re&s;pect, where|fore, he directs that his body may be found and laid by Imogen's.</P>
<P>Cymbeline now pre&s;ents him&s;elf, deeply agitated for the perilous, &s;ickly &s;tate of his queen, the elope|ment of Imogen, the ab&s;ence of Cloten, and the near approach of war. Per&s;uaded that Pi&s;anio has aided his daughter's flight, he breaths heavy threats, but is &s;oftened by one of his attendant lords, who draws his attention to the public danger, from the Roman legions being landed on his coa&s;t.</P>
<P>When Cymbeline goes off, Pi&s;anio, in &s;oliloquy, gives us to under&s;tand, that though he has wrote to Po&s;thumus, &s;ignifying Imogen's intention, yet no an&s;wer has reached his hands. In the mid&s;t of a
<PB N="92" REF="98">
perplexed, dubitable &s;tate, he re&s;olves to prove him|&s;elf, by acting in defence of his country, a good ci|tizen, and a loyal &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Imogen and Cloten, by a change of &s;cene, are di&s;covered; the former awaking from the trance &s;he had been thrown into, by the liquid which Pi&s;a|nio gave her, utters disjointed expre&s;&s;ions, pointing, however, to the chief object of her attention and re|gard: upon di&s;covering the dead body be&s;ide her, and &s;uppo&s;ing it, through knowledge of his cloaths, the actual coar&s;e of her hu&s;band, &s;he breaths out heart-felt lamentation for his fate, notwith&s;tanding the relentle&s;s &s;entence he pronounced again&s;t her life. While &s;he is in this pitiable &s;tate, Lucius en|ters, with &s;ome other Romans; on &s;eeing the dead, headle&s;s body, and Imogen pro&s;trate over it, tender feelings impel them to &s;eek a little further in the matter. Upon que&s;tion, the prince&s;s &s;ays it is her ma&s;ter, who lies &s;lain by mountaineers; the faith ex|pre&s;&s;ed by Imogen works a favourable impre&s;&s;ion upon Lucius, who, with his a&s;&s;ociates, determine to give the &s;uppo&s;ed Po&s;thumus as re&s;pectable inter|ment as their &s;ituation and means will admit: the amba&s;&s;ador's con&s;olative addre&s;s to Imogen, with which the fourth act concludes, is humane and phi|lo&s;ophical:
<Q><L>&mdash; be chearful, wipe thine eyes,</L>
<L>Some falls are means the happier to ari&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>Bellarius, and his adopted &s;ons, begin the fifth act; alarmed at an unaccu&s;tomed bu&s;tle they hear round them, the young princes manife&s;t a becoming &s;pirit, by wi&s;hing to mingle with the war: by the glow of their expre&s;&s;ion, and the warmth of their
<PB N="93" REF="99">
eager example, the old man kindles into &s;imilar feelings, and they unite in re&s;olution to take an active part in the field.</P>
<P>Po&s;thumus now pre&s;ents him&s;elf, ruminating on the death of his wife, and &s;eems deeply to repent the too har&s;h obedience of Pi&s;anio, in executing his &s;anguine order; it appears, this unhappy man has been brought from Italy to fight again&s;t his native &s;oil; &s;o ungracious a ta&s;k, however, he re&s;olves a|gain&s;t, and utters a de&s;ign of ob&s;curing him&s;elf in pea&s;ant's weeds, that under &s;uch cover, he may turn his &s;word again&s;t the enemies of Britain, and meet that death his di&s;tre&s;s of mind makes him wi&s;h for. We are amazed why the alterer of this piece &s;hould have retained &s;o many in&s;ignificant, jingling tags, at the end of &s;cenes, &s;uch as want even the merit of harmony.</P>
<P>Immediately after a general encounter of the Ro|man and Briti&s;h armies, Po&s;thumus meets and di&s;|arms Jachimo, but di&s;dains to take his life. This is generous, yet, if we con&s;ider that Jachimo has been the foundation of all Po&s;thumus's woes, and that he is a capital enemy to his country, the inci|dent does not appear &s;o natural as we could wi&s;h; however, &s;uch we find it, and the effect it has on Jachimo, is &s;uitable to a mind filled with con&s;cious guilt.</P>
<P>In the &s;hort &s;cene which follows, Pi&s;anio gives us to under&s;tand, that Cymbeline's victory was almo&s;t &s;olely derived from the intrepid behaviour of four per&s;ons, who, from his de&s;cription, appear to be Bellarius, Arviragus, Guiderius and Po&s;thumus.</P>
<P>Wearied with glorious action, dead to the charms of fame, and torn with perturbation of mind, Po&s;t|humus
<PB N="94" REF="100">
determines, in &s;oliloquy, to rea&s;&s;ume his Ita|lian garment, that he may fall by Briti&s;h hands.</P>
<P>Cymbeline is now di&s;covered in his tent, deliver|ing gracious thanks to Bellarius, and the two young warriors; at the &s;ame time, lamenting that the brave pea&s;ant who &s;hewed &s;uch heroi&s;m is not to be found. We think the omi&s;&s;ion of what concerns Cymbe|line's vile queen, and bringing on Lucius, &amp;c. im|mediately the monarch has conferred knighthood on his unknown heroes, is perfectly right.</P>
<P>When Cymbeline acquaints the Roman leader that a &s;acrifice is to be made of all the captives, to atone the &s;laughter of his &s;ubjects, Lucius not only &s;hews great magnanimity of mind, but tenderne&s;s of feeling, by confining his &s;olicitation of mercy to Imogen, in the character of Fidele; &s;truck by his daughter's countenance, the old monarch readily grants the reque&s;t, and admits the &s;uppo&s;ed page even to clo&s;e conference with him.</P>
<P>While Bellarius, &amp;c. are expre&s;&s;ing their &s;ur|prize to &s;ee the boy alive whom they &s;uppo&s;ed dead, Imogen moves her father to que&s;tion Jac|himo; this being granted, &s;he a&s;ks him concern|ing a ring he wears; terms of compul&s;ion are u&s;ed to draw an an&s;wer from him; this brings on gradually an explanation of Po&s;thumus's worth, Imogen's innocence, and Jachimo's villainy; the circum&s;tances related, though already known to the audience, bear repetition very well; what Jac|himo relates, works upon Po&s;thumus's grief and warmer pa&s;&s;ions &s;o &s;trongly, that he abruptly di&s;|covers him&s;elf, and &s;ollicits puni&s;hment for the de&s;truction of his wife; on Imogen's interpo&s;ing he ca&s;ts her &s;o rudely off, that Pi&s;anio inadvertent|ly
<PB N="95" REF="101">
di&s;covers Fidele to be the real Imogen; here a mo&s;t agreeable eclairci&s;&s;ement &s;trikes us, while Cymbeline and Po&s;thumus become in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly happier than &s;o har&s;h a father, and &s;o preci|pitate a hu&s;band could de&s;erve to be.</P>
<P>Cloten being mentioned, Guiderius avows hav|ing put him to death, and is for that action order|ed into cu&s;tody by Cymbeline; hence ari&s;es Bel|larius's di&s;clo&s;ure of the two young Princes, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment and joy of the old monarch; after their being received into the arms of pater|nal affection, Cymbeline again mentions the poor &s;oldier, when Po&s;thumus confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the per&s;on, and appeals to Jachimo, as having been vanqui&s;hed by him; this the Italian corroborates, at the &s;ame time, begging death from that hand which he has &s;o grievou&s;ly provoked: but the Bri|ton wraps his injuries in oblivion, and by an exam|ple of generous humanity, prevails on Cymbeline to grant a general pardon, with which the piece con|cludes.</P>
<P>The plot of this play has too &s;trong a taint of romance, and the ab&s;olute annihilation of unities is rather offen&s;ive; notwith&s;tanding Mr. GARRICK's pains, there are ab&s;urdities of a very gro&s;s nature. We remember to have &s;een an alteration of this play by one Mr. HAWKINS, played at YORK, and think it has con&s;iderable merit; however, we view SHAKESPEARE between the&s;e gentlemen as a &s;tately tree, abounding with di&s;proportionate &s;uperfluities; the former has been &s;o very tender of pruning, that a number of luxuriances remain; and the latter ad|mired the vegetation of his own brain &s;o much, that he has not only cut the noble plant into the &s;tiffne&s;s
<PB N="96" REF="102">
of an yew hedge, but decked it like a may-pole, with poetical garlands, which prove rather gaudy than u&s;eful ornaments. Mr. GARRICK's is, no doubt, be&s;t calculated for action, but Mr. HAW|KINS's will &s;tand a chance of plea&s;ing every fanciful reader better, becau&s;e he has in many places har|monized the expre&s;&s;ion, and rendered the ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages more intelligible, however, we wi&s;h he had retained more of the original, and Mr. GARRICK le&s;s.</P>
<P>In point of character, this play is well &s;upplied with a judicious variety, the lights and &s;hades are &s;o blended as to furni&s;h a picture of human nature, both &s;triking and in&s;tructive. As to Cymbeline, he is drawn, what we have &s;trong rea&s;on to believe &s;e|veral monarchs have been, and what no doubt many in future will be, a fool; ea&s;ily wrought upon, by de&s;igning per&s;ons, to actions totally below and in|con&s;i&s;tent with his rank in life. Upon the &s;tage, he is no more nor le&s;s than a very poor creature, hav|ing nothing to &s;ay as a counter-balance to the con|temptible light in which he appears.</P>
<P>If an actor can have any merit in the part, we are willing to allow Mr. HURST &s;ome; indeed, this gentleman &s;eems to have good capabilities for pa|rental feelings. As to Mr. GIBSON, we have men|tioned him &s;o often di&s;advantageou&s;ly, that we are ab&s;olutely weary of finding fault with his perform|ance; and therefore &s;hall only &s;ay for the pre&s;ent, that he is &s;econd be&s;t in this &s;imple monarch.</P>
<P>Cloten is a &s;trange and hateful compo&s;ition, tri|fling, coxcomical, malevolent, pert and proud; yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which is &s;omewhat &s;trange in &s;uch a creature, of re&s;olution. His circum&s;tances mo&s;tly
<PB N="97" REF="103">
pre&s;ent him as an object of contempt, mingled with laughter, and his fall is a very fit &s;acrifice to poeti|cal ju&s;tice. This empty-headed prince can never gain much favourable notice from an audience, Mr. KING and Mr. YATES, both make more of him than critici&s;m &s;hould expect, nor is Mr. DODD any way deficient.</P>
<P>Po&s;thumus, as drawn by the author, has two mo&s;t amiable qualities, con&s;tancy in love, and courage in the field; yet, if we examine them narrowly, we &s;hall perceive the former &s;trongly tainted with jea|lou&s;y, the latter impelled by de&s;pair. That he is weak in his under&s;tanding, we need only appeal to his &s;trange wager with Jachimo, on which the plot is founded; a circum&s;tance, which would lead us to think, that in SHAKESPEARE's days, as well as at pre&s;ent, it was the method to determine argu|ments, not by rea&s;on, but betting. That this hero is clouded with ra&s;hne&s;s and a mixture of cru|elty, witne&s;s his commi&s;&s;ion to Pi&s;anio; however, his &s;ituation is &s;uch, that through the whole we find him an object of very intere&s;ting concern, and are led to pity, even where we mu&s;t blame.</P>
<P>A multitude of in&s;tances concur to prove, that no performer ever knew his own abilities better, or &s;trove more earne&s;tly to keep them in the proper channel, than Mr. GARRICK; his revival of this play, were there no other motives but a fre&s;h oppor|tunity of di&s;playing his unparalelled powers, merits a large portion of public prai&s;e; for, we are bold to affirm, that con&s;idering an actor mu&s;t make the part, not the part an actor, his a&s;toni&s;hing talents were never more happily exerted; this a&s;&s;ertion be|comes more evident, by con&s;idering that the falling
<PB N="98" REF="104">
off from him to any other per&s;on who has &s;ince done it, is greater than in any other character; the ten|derne&s;s of his love, the pathos of his grief, the fire of his rage, and the di&s;traction of his jealou&s;y, have never been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, and po&s;&s;ibly, in Po&s;thumus, will never be equalled.</P>
<P>Mr. POWELL, who pa&s;&s;ed through this part with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of public e&s;timation, was in his merit confined to tenderne&s;s alone; he much wanted e&s;&s;ential rapidity of expre&s;&s;ion, and the natural va|riety of &s;udden tran&s;itions, incident to jealou&s;y, rage and de&s;pair. Notwith&s;tanding general opinion, we are inclined to think this gentleman's voice and fea|tures fell very &s;hort of the bolder pa&s;&s;ions, for which rea&s;on his Po&s;thumus, though an agreeable piece of acting, could never be ju&s;tly deemed great. Mr. REDDISH, who&s;e general merit we are glad to al|low, is &s;till more deficient. La&s;t winter a remarka|ble piece of managerical ignorance or cruelty, was manife&s;ted at Covent Garden, by <HI>popping</HI> on a young per&s;on, who had never played before, in this ardu|ous, tickli&s;h, and, as we think, unfavourable cha|racter; had he been tried in one of many more practicable parts, which the people are u&s;ed to &s;ee murdered, &s;ucce&s;s might have been the con&s;equence. Mr. BENSLEY has &s;ince done it, ha! ha! ha!</P>
<P>Bellarius is an old gentleman, well worthy of that re&s;pect he generally meets; virtuou&s;ly philo&s;ophi|cal, cooly brave, &s;en&s;ible, humane and benevolent; his &s;entiments and expre&s;&s;ions are &s;uch as mu&s;t plea&s;e and in&s;truct; for this rea&s;on he is acceptable even in Mr. BURTON's repre&s;entation, which we deem for the mo&s;t part very dry and unaffecting. Mr. CLARKE renders him much more greeable;
<PB N="99" REF="105">
but we are obliged to travel as far as YORK for the be&s;t that we have &s;een, one Mr. ORAM, who&s;e merit both in tragedy and comedy, &s;hould have tran&s;plant|ed him to the capital many years &s;ince.</P>
<P>Arviragus and Guiderius are in no &s;hape remark|able, nor are any forcible requi&s;ites wanting to re|pre&s;ent them; wherefore, the four following <HI>charm|ing</HI> performers, whom we lump together from equa|lity and &s;imilarity of merit, may continue to <HI>do</HI> them without much offence; Me&s;&s;rs. CAUTHERLY and BRERETON, at Drury Lane; PERRY and WROUGH|N, at Covent Garden.</P>
<P>In the alteration of this play by Mr. HAWKINS, Palador, the elde&s;t prince, is made rather more con|&s;picuous than Po&s;thumus, and we remember an ec|centric genius at YORK, Mr. FRODSHAM, who per|formed him with &s;ingular merit. This per&s;on, though he never reached a Theatre Royal, had ex|ten&s;ive powers, good feelings, and the advantage of a liberal education to improve natural under&s;tand|ing, yet was often as great an oddity as ever pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to the public eye; wild and unculti|vated, his beauties and faults re&s;embled a paterre of flowers, choaked up with weeds; the &s;tage is &s;el|dom enriched with &s;uch a genius, had he been early placed under critical limitation.</P>
<P>Pi&s;anio we mu&s;t regard as a &s;teady, prudent, faithful &s;ervant; he is a very amiable object in the drama, and is &s;upported at both hou&s;es with plea|&s;ing propriety by Mr. HULL and Mr. PACKER.</P>
<P>Jachimo is a villain of the deepe&s;t die, who from a principle of o&s;tentatious gallantry, frames the mo&s;t iniquitous fal&s;hood; and lays the foundation, not on|ly of mi&s;ery but murder, merely to win a paltry wa|ger.
<PB N="100" REF="106">
Iago, Shylock, Richard, &amp;c. have &s;ome co|lour for their abominable behaviour, but this Ita|lian none. Con&s;idered in a &s;tate of action, the part de&s;erves a capital actor; Mr. SMITH po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es that ea&s;y elegance and &s;pirit which the character requires; but, we mu&s;t be of opinion, that Mr. HOLLAND, notwith&s;tanding his affectation, claimed a &s;uperiori|ty, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t act. Mr. PALMER, though not equal to either of the&s;e gentlemen, &s;tands better in this part than could be expected from his &s;tation, and his experience of the &s;tage. We cordially re|commend moderation in acting to this young per|former, loudne&s;s of &s;peaking, and violence of acti|on, under the fal&s;e notion of &s;pirit, are, with few ex|ceptions, very offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Philario Lucius, &amp;c. may be done with &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of executive abilities, that the mention of any particular per&s;ons in &s;uch parts would be to|tally &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>The Queen is a fini&s;hed female mon&s;ter, deceit|ful, ambitious, and cruel, without any one recom|mendation, either from word or &s;entiment; a terri|ble weight upon any actre&s;s, and an offence to hu|manity. She generally falls to the &s;hare of a third and fourth rate performer, and indeed de&s;erves no better; we think a total omi&s;&s;ion of her would have mended the piece: Mrs. REDDISH and Mrs. VIN|CENT are pa&s;&s;able enough in this hateful, immate|rial weed of royalty.</P>
<P>Imogen, for tender, &s;teady affection, is a com|pliment to her &s;ex, and opens a fair field for happy talents to di&s;play them&s;elves with &s;ucce&s;s; &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es great force and variety, but falls off unpardon|ably towards the conclu&s;ion. Mrs. CIBBER's very
<PB N="101" REF="107">
affecting capabilities, were much better &s;uited to this character than tho&s;e of any other lady we have &s;een; Mrs. YATES has great merit in repre&s;enting the prince&s;s, but wants an e&s;&s;ential, elegant innocence; Mrs. BULKLEY has given us more plea&s;ure than could be expected, from a lady &s;o little &s;een; and Mi&s;s YOUNGE has &s;ome title to prai&s;e, though a proper melifluous flow of expre&s;&s;ion and ea&s;e of action, are wanting.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, CYMBELINE, as it is now per|formed, &s;tands a good chance of being a &s;tock, or living play, as long as theatrical entertainments are in e&s;teem, To atone for gro&s;s irregularities, the incidents are well imagined, the language nervous, the &s;entiments elevated, and the characters, except in the la&s;t &s;cene, where there is a &s;trange huddle of di&s;coveries, well &s;upported; as to moral, we cannot di&s;cover any, but that providence, by un&s;een means, re&s;tores &s;uffering innocence to happine&s;s: jadicious readers will ever find plea&s;ure from this tragedy in the clo&s;et, but decorations and action will mo&s;t recommend it to general ta&s;te.</P>

<HEAD>MAID of the MILL. A COMIC OPERA. By Mr. BICKERSTAFF.</HEAD>
<P>A Chorus and duett in prai&s;e of rural compe|tence, plea&s;ure and content, open this opera; after which, Fairfield, the miller, expre&s;&s;ing &s;atisfaction at &s;uch chearfulne&s;s, as gives &s;pirit to labour, orders his &s;on Ralph to load flour for Lord Aimworth's; to this the lad replies churli&s;hly, and remarks on a partiality to his &s;i&s;ter Pat, both in re&s;pect of educa|tion, and her manner of living. His ob&s;ervations are plea&s;ant and pertinent; the old man &s;ugge&s;ts from &s;uch a glibne&s;s of tongue, that his &s;on is drunk, but Ralph denies the charge, though he acknow|ledges having been treated with &s;ome wine by a gentleman from London; to whom he &s;peaks of returning, and therefore in defiance of all his father's threats, determines not to do any work for the day, concluding their di&s;putes with a &s;ong characteri&s;ti|cally worded, and well calculated for comic ex|pre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Patty, called by her father, comes forward, and in|troduces her&s;elf to our acquaintance with a &s;ong, intimating that love, and of a hopele&s;s nature, has invaded her brea&s;t: from the conver&s;ation between Patty and her father, we learn, that a match is de|pending between one Mi&s;s Sycamore and Lord Aimworth; &s;ome ob&s;ervations occur re&s;pecting a melancholly which hangs round our Maid of the

Mill, and Fairfield, like a prudent, affectionate fa|ther, propo&s;es farmer Giles to her as a &s;uitable hus|band; her reply is complacent and dutiful; on the miller's mention that he may prove a much better man than many who move in the character of gen|tlemen, Patty corroborates his &s;entiment in an agree|able air, which has both good &s;en&s;e and a &s;hare of fancy to recommend it, for which rea&s;on we &s;hall pre&s;ent the reader with an opportunity to peru&s;e it.</P>

<P>The word <HI>&s;hows</HI> in the fir&s;t line, and that which rhimes to it in the third, we apprehend exceptiona|ble; not only as mere make&s;hifts, but al&s;o being uncha&s;te, and rather ungrammatical.</P>
<P>Upon Patty's going off, farmer Giles enters, and enquires what hopes; Fairfield encourages him, by &s;eeming to think there is no doubt of his &s;ucce&s;s, but intimates, that her peculiar obligations to Lord Aimworth's family, requires their con&s;ent to every material &s;tep &s;he takes. Giles from hence hints a prevailing report that Lord Aimworth, as he phra&s;es it, has a &s;neaking kindne&s;s for Patty; this &s;uppo|&s;ition her father treats as an idle tale, and immedi|ately advi&s;es to &s;ollicit the peer's con&s;ent to his pro|po&s;ed match; this the hearty ru&s;tic gladly con&s;ents
<PB N="104" REF="110">
to, but wi&s;hing to pay his mi&s;tre&s;s a per&s;onal com|pliment, the miller points her out in the next room; upon which he addre&s;&s;es her in a &s;ong of &s;ome hu|mour, and without waiting for any reply, or any immediate interview, he retires.</P>
<P>Patty now appears, and receives from her father the painful information, that her di&s;gu&s;tful admirer is gone to &s;olicit Lord Aimworth's approbation of the depending match; this throws her into a &s;trong agitation of mind, and by he&s;itative intimations &s;he &s;ignifies it; however, upon the miller's warm re|mon&s;trances, &s;he &s;eems to acquie&s;ce, when he leaves her to a &s;oliloquy, in which &s;he di&s;covers the real bent of her pa&s;&s;ion is to Lord Aimworth; who, ac|cording to her &s;uppo&s;ition, does not hold her indif|ferently; neverthele&s;s, &s;everal irk&s;ome doubts ari&s;e, which in the true operatical &s;tile, are compo&s;ed for the pre&s;ent with a &s;ong, very languid, both in ver&s;i|fication and &s;entiment.</P>
<P>Sir Harry Sycamore, and his daughter Theodo&s;ia, now mount the &s;tage; by what pa&s;&s;es, we are in|formed, that love is playing cro&s;s purpo&s;es in this family al&s;o. Theodo&s;ia upbraids the old gentleman with having encouraged her to receive the addre&s;&s;es of one Mr. Mervin, and having di&s;carded him to make way for a treaty of alliance with Lord Aim|worth; the baronet's defence is rather eva&s;ively lu|dicrous than rational, and he is at la&s;t obliged to own, that he has &s;acrificed his own opinion to that of Lady Sycamore. Such conde&s;cen&s;ion the young lady rather objects to, as the effect of good nature improperly extended; and, with a becoming &s;pirit of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, upon being a&s;ked if &s;he could give up the view of titles and ample fortune, de|clares
<PB N="105" REF="111">
&s;he would mo&s;t willingly; rather chu&s;ing to embrace a cupid of her own liking, in the humble&s;t garb, than one with golden wings contrary to her free, generous inclination.</P>
<P>Lady Sycamore now enters, full of the dazzling appearance of jewels her daughter is to become mi|&s;tre&s;s of, and calls them with other appendages of quality, the ble&s;&s;ings of life. Theodo&s;ia's more ra|tional idea of things brings on an altercation, and &s;he is taxed with lowne&s;s of &s;pirit, in preferring a pitiful citizen to a noble peer; there is a con&s;idera|ble &s;hare of plea&s;ing humour in what pa&s;&s;es here, and Sir Harry is brought into a kind of dilemma by Theodo&s;ia's ob&s;erving, that he is not aver&s;e to her match with Mervin; however, the old lady pre|vails, and the knight &s;ings forth his re&s;entment for the young lady's contradicting her mama.</P>
<P>Lord Aimworth comes forward, introducing Giles; after paying a &s;hort compliment to Sir Har|ry, his lord&s;hip enters upon the farmer's bu&s;ine&s;s: being informed it is for his leave to marry, he gives it with conde&s;cending cordiality, and adds his hopes, that Giles has made a prudent choice. After &s;ome &s;imple, ludicrous circumlocution, the ru&s;tic names his &s;weetheart; upon which the peer pronounces her a de&s;erving object, but &s;eems a little particular, in a&s;king whether the girl is willing, whether &s;he &s;ent to a&s;k his con&s;ent, and whether her genteel edu|cation may not render her unfit for &s;uch a match. Giles's &s;ong in prai&s;e of his mi&s;tre&s;s's notable quali|fications, has &s;pirit and humour.</P>
<P>After Giles is gone off, Sir Harry &s;lily in&s;inuates, that a tenant to take off a ca&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, is very con|venient; then talks of his own youthful gallantry plea&s;antly enough, but carries the joke too far when
<PB N="106" REF="112">
his matrimonial cha&s;tity is mentioned; for which Lady Sycamore, with &s;trict propriety, drives him out of the room.</P>
<P>Lord Aimworth left alone, meditates on, and acknowledges his embarra&s;&s;ed &s;tate between Theo|do&s;ia, to whom he is engaged by promi&s;e, and Patty, to whom he is attached by inclination; &s;ome pretty remarks upon the hard re&s;trictions of birth and &s;ta|tion occur, but his lord&s;hip's &s;ong we are not very fond of, as the idea is &s;omewhat forced, and the &s;imi|litude rather ob&s;cure, though trite.</P>
<P>Ralph and Mervin here enter, followed by Fan|ny, who, as a gyp&s;ey, pre&s;&s;es the latter hard for charity, but her &s;uit is not attended to immediately, as his attention is engaged by Theodo&s;ia's &s;uppo&s;ed fal&s;hood; however, he is at length &s;ung out of a bounty, at which Ralph &s;eems very angry, and threatens to take it from her. By the following part of this &s;cene we find, that Ralph has a parti|cular tendre for her, which he communicates as a profound and important &s;ecret. Mervin, through Ralph's intimacy with the gyp&s;ies, &s;trikes out a &s;cheme of di&s;gui&s;ing him&s;elf as one of the gang, that he may thereby get a &s;ight of his mi&s;tre&s;s; Ralph promi&s;es him what he de&s;ires, the cit then makes a mu&s;ical exit, and aptly compares his ha|zardous metamorpho&s;e to the ventures of a mer|chant, who runs known hazards in pur&s;uit of what he admires.</P>
<P>Giles enters with Patty and Fanny, full of his &s;ucce&s;s with Lord Aimworth, which he relates; but does not meet with the reception he &s;eems to expect. Churli&s;h Ralph throws in a remark, that his &s;i&s;ter &s;hould change her cloaths for &s;uch as &s;uit her &s;ta|tion
<PB N="107" REF="113">
better; &s;he promi&s;es to obey her father, and a quartetto, which concludes the fir&s;t act, is &s;ung; as to pieces of this &s;ort, the words being mere pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments for mu&s;ic and action, &s;hould not be cri|tici&s;ed.</P>
<P>Lord Aimworth opens the &s;econd act with a &s;oli|loquy, expre&s;&s;ing &s;entiments of virtuous tendency, and a delicate attachment to Patty; &s;ongs are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make an opera, el&s;e what his lord&s;hip &s;ings here might as well have been omitted. Our Maid of the Mill, with very natural awe and palpi|tation of heart, approaches her noble admirer; the encounter is well managed, and their conver&s;ation opens in an ea&s;y, plea&s;ing manner; her thanking him for favours conferred, and his manner of re|ceiving tho&s;e thanks, are prettily conceived; his lord&s;hip's remark upon the change of her dre&s;s, &s;hews that &s;he has &s;ome intere&s;t in his thoughts, and aptly introduces the indulgence his mother had &s;hewn the girl. There is a well connected chain of gradation from one &s;ubject to another in this &s;cene, and Lord Aimworth's dubitable, round about men|tion of farmer Giles, with Patty's replies, are, we conceive, a good picture of nature in &s;uch circum|&s;tances; his lord&s;hip's declaration of turning the hone&s;t, well-meaning ru&s;tic off his farm, may be a|pologized for as a probable &s;tart of jealou&s;y, but it infringes upon genero&s;ity of principle; however, there is &s;ome rea&s;on to think he does it merely to try whether &s;he has a po&s;itive regard for his rival or not. The feelings of two youthful minds in love with each other, yet ignorant of the mutual attach|ment, is very well de&s;cribed in this tete-a-tete; his lord&s;hip being good-naturedly peevi&s;h, and Patty

timerou&s;ly ob&s;cure; the tran&s;ition to a marriage with Theodo&s;ia is well introduced. At the con|clu&s;ion of this &s;cene Lord Aimworth's feelings ri&s;e into a ju&s;t degree of perplexity, and he goes off with a very tolerable &s;ong.</P>
<P>Upon the peer's departure Giles enters, informing Patty of &s;ome rural honours the tenants are going to pay Lord Aimworth's arrival, and &s;oliciting her as a partner in the fe&s;tival dance, being, as he &s;ays, intended his partner for life; upon mention of this la&s;t circum&s;tance, Patty enters into a &s;erious remon|&s;trance again&s;t Giles's hopes of a matrimonial union with her; nay, &s;he goes &s;o far as to declare an ab|&s;olute di&s;like, which even the authority of her father cannot remove, or, as &s;he expre&s;&s;es it in her &s;ong, fears of the greate&s;t hard&s;hips; leaving him with an earne&s;t reque&s;t not to harra&s;s her with &s;o irk&s;ome a &s;ubject: &s;he throws poor Giles into a con&s;terna|tion; his &s;uppo&s;ition that learning has cracked her brain, is extremely characteri&s;tic; and his method of accounting for the repul&s;e &s;he has given him, we hold in the &s;ame view; his &s;ong is nothing but a repetition of what he has &s;aid before, however, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a degree of humour that mu&s;t recommend it.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene we are entertained with &s;ome agreeable remarks on rural felicity, of which Patty and Theodo&s;ia &s;eem to have a ju&s;t and &s;pirited idea: Fanny, at Mervin's de&s;ire, approaches Theodo&s;ia, and addre&s;&s;es her in the right gip&s;ey, begging, for|tune-telling cant, but without effect. Mervin, un|der favour of his di&s;gui&s;e, pretends to pick up a pa|per, which is in reality a letter from him&s;elf to The|odo&s;ia; upon reading it, &s;he eagerly de&s;ires to be conducted to the writer of it; this induces the lover
<PB N="109" REF="115">
to di&s;cover him&s;elf, which he has but ju&s;t done when Sir Harry and Lady Sycamore come upon them. The knight happening to cough is humour|ou&s;ly reproved by his lady for not ob&s;erving her directions concerning health: upon mention of gyp&s;ies, Sir Harry a&s;&s;umes the magi&s;terial &s;tile, and rates them &s;oundly; however, urged and led on by Mervin, they pre&s;s after him; this occa&s;ions Lady Sycamore to expre&s;s apprehen&s;ions, while her va|lorous &s;pou&s;e &s;ings forth his re&s;entment in a rhap|&s;ody of abu&s;e again&s;t the mendicant crew; a cir|cum&s;tance which throws the gyp&s;ies into a con&s;ter|nation, le&s;t he &s;hould be a ju&s;tice of peace.</P>
<P>Mervin, who had followed Theodo&s;ia, returns much chagrined at her departure, drives off the gyp|&s;ies, and is in violent agitation about his mi&s;tre&s;s, who unexpectedly appears in the pavillion; upon &s;eeing her, with the true phrenzy of impatient love, he is for climbing up to her; however, this &s;he pru|dently forbids, and, as time pre&s;&s;es clo&s;e, &s;he comes at once not only to a declaration of love, but of her readine&s;s to elope with him. Here a fre&s;h difficulty ari&s;es, how to carry the lady off, having no car|riage or hor&s;es; &s;he de&s;ires him to expect her at the Mill, and to devi&s;e in the mean time &s;ome me|thod to accompli&s;h their mutual wi&s;hes; the amo|rous ditty &s;he &s;ings is made up of agreeable nothing|ne&s;s, founded on the pilfered idea of Juliet's calling Romeo back, and forgetting what &s;he has to &s;ay.</P>
<P>When Theodo&s;ia di&s;appears, Fanny claims from Mervin the reward he promi&s;ed her &s;ociety, which he gives her, &s;ugge&s;ting to him&s;elf a &s;cheme of get|ting Theodo&s;ia di&s;gui&s;ed as a gyp&s;y al&s;o. To fur|ther this purpo&s;e, and to make Fanny a fa&s;ter friend,
<PB N="110" REF="116">
he gives her a guinea, as earne&s;t of twenty more, if &s;he will fulfil his de&s;ires; Fanny, by mi&s;taking Mervin's meaning, gives the &s;cene an arch turn, fa|vourable to acting merit.</P>
<P>Ralph's appearance makes Fanny re&s;olve, that unle&s;s he fulfils his promi&s;e of marriage, he mu&s;t conver&s;e no more with her; &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s look gloomy, and receiving very &s;hort an&s;wers from her, the young miller enquires the cau&s;e, and intimates his having a bout with the gentleman, if he has been uncivil to her. This brings her to an explanation, and &s;he claims his promi&s;e; hence a well-conceived &s;quabble ari&s;es, and very ungentle terms en&s;ue: quite cock-a-hoop with her views from Mervin, Fanny rates him &s;oundly, and he in return treats her with as good as &s;he brings. This whole &s;cene is perfectly founded in nature, and expre&s;&s;ed happi|ly; Ralph's &s;oliloquy, wherein he vows revenge again&s;t his &s;uppo&s;ed rival, Mr. Mervin, is &s;pirited, humourous, and very much in character.</P>
<P>We are now conducted to the Mill, where we meet Fairfield and Giles over a pot of beer, the for|mer lamenting that his daughter is deaf to all per|&s;ua&s;ion, re&s;pecting the marriage; while the latter, with a blunt, generous degree of compo&s;ure, im|putes it to the right cau&s;e, her liking another better. His di&s;intere&s;ted &s;entiments in this &s;cene recommend him much, and his &s;en&s;ible re&s;ignation of the hopes he had formed, &s;hew a good head, as well as an ho|ne&s;t heart.</P>
<P>Lord Aimworth coming unexpectedly, Fairfield is rather puzzled to pay his re&s;pects with propriety, but is relieved by the peer's affable conde&s;cen&s;ion; who &s;hortly introduces the &s;ubject of Patty's mar|riage,
<PB N="111" REF="117">
and ob&s;erves, that nothing but the &s;udden death of his mother could-have prevented a genteel provi&s;ion being made for the girl; to repair which lo&s;s, with very delicate genero&s;ity, his lord&s;hip pre|&s;ents to the Miller a bill of a thou&s;and pounds, and takes on him&s;elf the expence of Patty's nuptials: Fairfield, after expre&s;&s;ing &s;uitable gratitude, ac|quaints Lord Aimworth with his daughter's aver|&s;ion to the match, and begs his influence to recon|cile her. This intelligence and reque&s;t cau&s;e his lord&s;hip fre&s;h perplexity; however, the miller &s;ends in Patty, between whom and the peer a &s;cene of cri|tical delicacy en&s;ues.</P>
<P>The manner in which Lord Aimworth &s;ounds Patty's real inclination, his playing moth like round the flame of his own pa&s;&s;ion, her diffidence and tre|mor of heart, his avowal of love, her declining the fir&s;t wi&s;h of her heart, to prevent any di&s;grace from falling on his rank, by an inadequate connection, all do the author of this piece great credit. Mat|ters are left in an undetermined &s;tate when Sir Har|ry enters, flu&s;tered with an idea that his daughter was near being carried off by a gyp&s;ey man; after expre&s;&s;ing his re&s;entment, he takes Lord Aimworth a&s;ide, in favour of Giles, who has been relating his di&s;appointment; while the peer and her father are in conver&s;e apart, Theodo&s;ia lets us hear her appro|bation of the gyp&s;ey &s;cheme.</P>
<P>Sir Harry acquaints Giles of my lord's good di&s;|po&s;ition towards him, and declaring that he will make all up, a quintetto, expre&s;&s;ive of their &s;everal feelings, concludes the &s;econd act.</P>
<P>Lady Sycamore, and her mate, at the beginning of the third act, are much agitated about their daugh|ter's
<PB N="112" REF="118">
elopement with a gyp&s;ey; Lord Aimworth en|deavours to &s;often matters, and de&s;ires that he may have the management of the affair, e&s;pecially as he has been the cau&s;e of Mi&s;s Sycamore's unea&s;ine&s;s. The knight's remarks upon ladies are rather har&s;h, and not very characteri&s;tic for a man &s;o much under the dominion of a crooked rib as he &s;eems to be. Ralph, under apprehen&s;ion of having done &s;omething wrong, apologizes to Lord Aimworth, who acquits him, and &s;eeing the miller, enquires his bu&s;ine&s;s; Fairfield, from a very delicate principle, acquaints him, that as talkative people have thrown out &s;can|dalous in&s;inuations, re&s;pecting the thou&s;and pound note given to him for Patty, he begs to return it; adding, that farmer Giles has been prejudiced a|gain&s;t Patty by means of it. Lord Aimworth con|de&s;cends to take back the note, and having been, though inadvertently, the cau&s;e of Patty's lo&s;ing one hu&s;band, promi&s;es to get her another, for which purpo&s;e he de&s;ires the miller to bring her immedi|ately, but detains him to take a letter he is going to write; then gives the audience a hint of his in|tention by a &s;ong.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene Fanny becomes petitioner to Ralph, who humorou&s;ly retorts upon her the rough treatment &s;he gave him, and &s;tands proof again&s;t all her &s;olicitation; we apprehend his &s;ong, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t ver&s;e, di&s;covers a delicacy of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion rather out of character for ma&s;ter Ralph. Fanny, finding his obduracy, laments her own for|&s;aken &s;tate; when &s;he mentions the gentleman, though an enraged gyp&s;ey might &s;ay, <HI>the devil run away with him,</HI> yet we apprehend it a very blamea|ble mode of expre&s;&s;ion for the &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="119">Farmer Giles now appears, nettled at &s;omething Patty has &s;aid to him, and from the warmth of con|ver&s;ation declares, that he wont have her; this a|larms her pride, le&s;t he &s;hould think her temper moved on that account, &s;he declares that nothing but painful nece&s;&s;ity could have obliged her even to a &s;eeming con&s;ent; here Giles exhibits a touch of the brute, and very ju&s;tly irritates Patty till her pa&s;&s;ion gets vent at her eyes, when &s;he &s;ings the fol|lowing air, which we think worth tran&s;cribing.</P>

to his lord&s;hip's. On peru&s;al of the letter, their &s;cheme of running away is laid a&s;ide, and they re|&s;olve to obey the peer's &s;ummons. Theodo&s;ia throwing out a good-natured doubt of Mervin's &s;incerity, he an&s;wers by a &s;ong, founded upon one of the mo&s;t hackneyed &s;entiments in poetical com|po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Giles, in a &s;oliloquy of &s;ome humour, acquaints us that he has heard of Lord Aimworth's promi&s;e to get Patty a hu&s;band, and throws out his con|jectures who it may be; he al&s;o expre&s;&s;es his &s;atis|faction at having e&s;caped the noo&s;e, with one he &s;uppo&s;es a ca&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, and re&s;olves to live a batche|lor, that he may avoid the chance of being a cuckold.</P>
<P>From the Mill we are again conveyed to Lord Aimworth's hou&s;e, where we meet with his lord&s;hip removing Fairfield's unea&s;ine&s;s, at the attack which has been made upon his daughter's reputation. When the miller declares him&s;elf content, and is go|ing home, the peer &s;urprizes him with a propo&s;ition of taking Patty for his lady; the old man's &s;well of heart at &s;uch unexpected honour, the young wo|man's a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;uch unfore&s;een happine&s;s, with his lord&s;hip's tender declarations, render this &s;cene affecting; and, we venture to affirm, that what Ralph &s;ays upon his &s;i&s;ter's wanting a proper ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nowledgment, is as natural, comprehen&s;ive, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne an effu&s;ion of &s;implicity, as ever fell from any author's pen,  <Q REND="inline">"Down on your knees, and fall a crying."</Q></P>

the wi&s;hes of Theodo&s;ia and her lover are to be fulfilled. Upon his lord&s;hip's pre&s;enting Patty as his intended bride, &s;ome objections are &s;tarted by Sir Harry and his lady, which the peer genteely and &s;en&s;ibly &s;ets a&s;ide; then proceeds to provide for his hone&s;t father-in-law, and declares an intention of get|ting Ralph a commi&s;&s;ion. The forward young ru&s;tic's re&s;olution of keeping Fan when he is an of|ficer, and his elevated pertne&s;s, are circum&s;tances highly in nature. Giles joining the company, is introduced to his former &s;weetheart, and promi&s;ed remi&s;&s;ion of a year's rent; all parties thus accomo|dated, the piece concludes with an alternate &s;ong.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the plot of this opera, it is &s;im|ple, uniform and intere&s;ting; the &s;cenes are ranged in an agreeable &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the &s;ongs flow natu|rally from the dialogue, which we think well varied for, and adapted to the characters; neither the &s;en|timents nor ver&s;ification of the &s;ongs de&s;erves much prai&s;e, and we &s;uppo&s;e the author only meant them as mere in&s;truments for combining and conveying mu&s;ical &s;ounds.</P>
<P>In a review of the characters, we find Lord Aim|worth what every nobleman &s;hould be, and what we fear very few are, humane, generous, virtuous and di&s;intere&s;ted; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing too much good &s;en&s;e to be &s;wayed by an irrational pride of birth, and too much delicacy of &s;entiment to approach the object of his love upon unworthy terms. As the part in repre&s;entation requires more of the feeling actor, than the harmonious &s;inger, however we may like Mr. MATTOCKS in the airs, we mu&s;t rather object to him in the dialogue; nervele&s;s expre&s;&s;ion and unvarying features, throw a great damp on this part.
<PB N="116" REF="122">
We are &s;orry to &s;ay, that the &s;ame remark is equally applicable to Mr. DUBELLAMY, who has confe&s;&s;ed|ly much merit as a &s;inger, not one grain as a &s;peak|er. Mr. REDDISH did it for his benefit, as we re|member, and appeared the exact rever&s;e of tho&s;e gentlemen we have mentioned; &s;uppo&s;ing his view was more to get money than fame, and that he did not mean to impo&s;e him&s;elf on the public as a mu|&s;ical performer, his Lord Aimworth was re&s;pectable.</P>
<P>Sir Harry Sycamore is a talkative, vain, igno|rant baronet, well calculated for Mr. SHUTER, who certainly exhibits him with whim&s;ical plea&s;antry; however, though we give him the foremo&s;t prai&s;e, ju&s;tice obliges us to &s;ay, that Mr. PARSONS treads clo&s;e on his heels and &s;hews him&s;elf a very capable &s;ervitor in the temple of Momus.</P>
<P>Mervin is a loving gentleman, of very little merit, and at each hou&s;e has fallen into very feeble hands; Me&s;&s;rs. BAKER and FAWCET do, if po&s;&s;ible, le&s;s for him than the author has done; &s;o that what Mr. BICKERSTAFF has faintly conceived, they as in&s;ipid|ly execute.</P>
<P>Fairfield, the miller, is a mo&s;t amiable ru&s;tic, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of feelings and ideas equal to a more exalted character, a kind parent, and an hone&s;t man; the &s;ituation he is placed in, and his mode of behaviour, render him an object of re&s;pect and concern. We are extremely plea&s;ed at meeting an opportunity of giving Mr. GIBSON our approbation in this part, and we have never mentioned him di&s;advantageou&s;ly, but his worth in private life made us peculiarly la|ment his deficiencies on the &s;tage. Mr. JEFFERSON having the advantage of much freer expre&s;&s;ion than Mr. GIBSON, we mu&s;t give him &s;o far the preference.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="123">Giles is an extreme well-drawn, rural character, and Mr. BEARD did that hone&s;t, unaffected &s;implicity which di&s;tingui&s;h him, particular ju&s;tice; his hu|mour was natural, forcible and intelligible. The farmer has never been quite him&s;elf &s;ince that very excellent &s;inging actor has left the &s;tage; however, impartiality demands that we &s;hould allow Mr. BAN|NISTER a very happy &s;hare of execution, both in the &s;peaking and &s;inging, con&s;iderably more than any competitor &s;ince the original. Mr. REINHOLD has performed the part with a con&s;iderable &s;hare of merit, but wants an e&s;&s;ential mellowne&s;s of humour; and Mr. BARNSHAW has exbibited the farmer, but having more of the Clare Market knock-me-down knowing-one, than ru&s;tic &s;implicity, was by no means an agreeable repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>Ralph is drawn with much plea&s;ant propriety, and &s;upported equally through the whole. What|ever merit Mr. DIBDIN may have in compo&s;ition, he certainly has not the &s;hadow of any in acting; wherefore, we are hardy enough to &s;ay, the young miller could &s;carce have fallen into wor&s;e hands.</P>
<P>Mr. DYER has &s;ome degree of &s;pirit and nature, yet, if we may allude to painting, his performance is little more than dead colouring the character. If Mr. KING had not nece&s;&s;arily a ca&s;t of parts, which &s;carce allows him proper relaxation, the young mil|ler &s;hould mo&s;t certainly be rendered a public fa|vourite, by the recommendation of his truly comic powers.</P>
<P>Lady Sycamore is a vain, po&s;itive old lady, who holds her lord and ma&s;ter in that light we fear many wives do; and thinks her own under&s;tanding is &s;hewn to more advantage, by taking him into the
<PB N="118" REF="124">
leading-&s;trnigs of her direction. Her over&s;trained mode&s;ty in catching at the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of licentious ideas, is very characteri&s;tic; her formality and fal&s;e con&s;equence, are excellently &s;upported by Mrs. PITT; and Mrs. BRADSHAW, though inferior, cannot fail to gratify an audience.</P>
<P>Theodo&s;ia, who has nothing particular to mark her character, and is like mo&s;t other marriagable young ladies, &s;uffers no injury from Mrs. BAKER, or Mi&s;s RADLEY, but we apprehend the &s;uperior &s;en|&s;ibility of Mrs. MATTOCKS, renders her more plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Patty appears to be an object of the author's par|ticular attention; he has drawn her with &s;o many amiable qualities, that even pride mu&s;t allow Lord Aimworth ju&s;tifiable, in de&s;cending &s;o much below his rank to &s;ecure happine&s;s. Mrs. PINTO's execu|tion of the &s;ongs has been &s;o generally allowed, and had &s;uch amazing influence at the original perform|ance of this piece, that we doubt whether in that re&s;pect, the &s;tage will ever find her equal; as to the &s;peaking, &s;he was much wor&s;e than any one we have ever heard: however, be her deficiencies what they may, Covent Garden theatre, in common gratitude, owes her a pen&s;ion of two hundred a year, for im|men&s;e advantages received, even though &s;he was ne|ver to &s;peak or &s;ing a line more. Mrs. MATTOCKS has given us more plea&s;ure in Patty than Mrs. PIN|TO, but beyond all doubt the feelings and expre&s;|&s;ion of Mrs. BADDELY, rank her fir&s;t in critical e&s;|teem.</P>
<P>Placed between tho&s;e very engaging and &s;pirited gyp&s;ies, Mrs. THOMPSON and Mi&s;s POPE, we may &s;ay with Macheath,  <Q REND="inline">"Which way &s;hall we turn us,

<P>The author of this opera has candidly acknow|ledged taking his plan from Pamela, and we are happy to congratulate him on having made a very good and agreeable u&s;e of the materials furni&s;hed by that romance; his humour is not tainted with licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and the nicer feelings are wrought up with a probable and in&s;tructive delicacy; upon the whole, we think the MAID of the MILL po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch charms, &s;uch a cha&s;te, plea&s;ing &s;implicity, that both in repre&s;entation and peru&s;al, &s;he mu&s;t have many admirers.</P>

<HEAD>DOUGLAS. A TRAGEDY. By Mr. JOHN HOME.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Randolph, formerly married to a chief of the name of Douglas, but at the time of this tra|gedy e&s;pou&s;ed to Lord Randolph, opens the piece with a &s;oliloquy, expre&s;&s;ing that &s;ettled grief which hangs upon her heart, for the lo&s;s of her decea&s;ed lord, and infant &s;on. While in this &s;tate of mourn|ful meditation, her living lord appears, and in mild terms reproves the melancholy &s;he wears; nay, is &s;o very moderate in his expectations, that he only requires from her a decent affection; failing of which, his wi&s;h is to mingle with the war, threatened by a Dani&s;h inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>The lady here lets a ray of kindne&s;s break through the clouds of &s;orrow, and &s;peaking of war, &s;he makes a ju&s;t and plea&s;ing di&s;tinction between that waged with a foreign power, and different ends of the &s;ame i&s;land, which nature has united, conflicting with each other. There is a pretty compliment to the union, and the courage of South and North Britain, in this &s;peech: Lord Randolph retiring, Anna ap|pears; this kind confidant, by &s;triving to balm her lady's wounded heart, probes and pains it the more; the pretence of grief being for a lo&s;t brother, Anna a&s;ks, what her feelings mu&s;t be, had a tender, be|loved hu&s;band been &s;natched from her arms. Touch|ing upon this ma&s;ter-&s;tring of her heart, &s;he leads
<PB N="121" REF="127">
Lady Randolph to a full di&s;clo&s;ure of her mind: the narration of her &s;ecret marriage, and the fate of her hu&s;band is natural and pathetic; her grief for expo&s;ing her child to the fate &s;he &s;uppo&s;es he met, is well de&s;cribed. When Lady Randolph ob&s;erves, that a fore knowledge of the evils which had em|bittered her pa&s;t life, would certainly have broken her heart, Anna makes this very &s;en&s;ible and moral reply:
<Q><L>That God who&s;e mini&s;ters good angels are,</L>
<L>Hath &s;hut the book in mercy to mankind.</L></Q></P>
<P>This conver&s;ation, which we think rather too much extended for &s;tage action, is interrupted by the approach of Glenalvon, a per&s;on, who, from what &s;he &s;ays, is rather di&s;agreeable to Lady Ran|dolph, for which &s;he a&s;&s;igns &s;ufficient rea&s;on, by &s;ketching his character, and retires. A very imma|terial &s;oliloquy, trite in &s;entiment, but tolerably well expre&s;&s;ed, intervenes between Lady Randolph's exit and Glenalvon's entrance; this enterprizing blade que&s;tions Anna re&s;pecting the thoughtfulne&s;s of her a&s;pect, and pays &s;ome compliment to her charms; this fading advantage &s;he holds light, from Lady Randolph's woes, and with dutiful feeling for her mi&s;tre&s;s's painful &s;tate, follows to relieve her.</P>
<P>When alone, Glenalvon lays him&s;elf open to the audience for a con&s;ummate villain, declares him&s;elf Randolph's &s;ecret rival, and &s;ignifies, that there is a &s;cheme on foot to deprive the un&s;u&s;pecting baron of his lady, fortunes and life.</P>

as a young &s;hepherd, who has re&s;cued him from the de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault of four a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins: after thanks re|turned to the gallant &s;tranger, both by the baron and his lady, enquiry is made concerning who the brave deliverer is; to this Douglas replies with a mode&s;ty peculiar to great minds, that his name is Norval, and that his father is a &s;hepherd on the Grampian Hills, that an attack made upon their property, by a band of ruffians, &s;ome days before, had given his active &s;pirit an opportunity of exerting it&s;elf, that his &s;ucce&s;s in defeating the banditti, had in&s;pired him with martial ideas, and that having heard of an impending war, he propo&s;ed entering the field in his country's cau&s;e, as a volunteer. On Lord Ran|dolph's promi&s;ing him protection and patronage, he replies with a manly &s;en&s;e of favour, and his noble friend takes him off to vi&s;it and view the camp.</P>
<P>The feelings of maternal &s;ympathy dawn in this &s;cene, and the following one with Anna, they are judiciou&s;ly manife&s;ted in Lady Randolph's regard for her unknown &s;on; well knowing the treachery of Glenalvon's heart, and his jealou&s;y of any one who may rival him in Randolph's e&s;teem, &s;he determines to be young Norval's guardian. The following &s;imilitude of her&s;elf to a flower, is fanciful and pretty, but poetical allu&s;ions we deem unnatural to a mind di&s;ea&s;ed; peru&s;al however may not be un|plea&s;ing:
<Q><L>I'll be the arti&s;t of young Norval's fortune;</L>
<L>'Tis plea&s;ing to admire! mo&s;t apt was I</L>
<L>To this affection in my better days:</L>
<L>Though now I &s;eem to you &s;hrunk up, retired</L>
<L>Within the narrow compa&s;s of my woe;</L>
<L><PB N="123" REF="129">Have you not &s;ometimes &s;een an early flow'r</L>
<L>Open its bud, and &s;pread its &s;ilken leaves</L>
<L>To catch &s;weet airs, and odours to be&s;tow;</L>
<L>Then by the keen bla&s;t nipp'd&mdash;pull in its leaves</L>
<L>And though &s;till living die to &s;cent and beauty?</L>
<L>Emblem of me; affliction like a &s;torm</L>
<L>Has kill'd the forward blo&s;&s;om of my heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon Glenalvon's appearance and enquiry after Randolph's welfare, Matilda gives him to under|&s;tand, we think too plainly, her knowledge of his character and real feelings; &s;tartled with her charge and con&s;cious guilt, he endeavours to apologize, but by the mention of love, increa&s;es her contempt and dete&s;tation. At length, &s;he acquaints him, rather indi&s;creetly, with Randolph's attachment to his de|liverer, and by threats alarms his jealou&s;y; this, upon going off, plainly appears, for in the &s;ucceeding &s;oliloquy, he determines to aggravate his former crimes, by removing young Norval at any rate; and, for that purpo&s;e, re&s;olves to try the cowardly attendant who for&s;ook him in re&s;cuing Lord Ran|dolph, &s;hrewdly ob&s;erving, that the greate&s;t da&s;tards are capable of harbouring dangerous revenge.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, we meet Mrs. Anna &s;oliloquizing to very little purpo&s;e, as all &s;he &s;ays amounts to no more than telling us in a diffu&s;e, flowery &s;tile, that Lady Randolph is a&s;leep, and that &s;he heartily wi&s;hes her a good nap; indeed, &s;he prays for it prettily enough, but placing immortal &s;pirits upon <HI>golden beds,</HI> &s;avours too much of gro&s;s mortality; be&s;ides, if we take the idea literally, a bed of &s;traw is preferable to a bed of gold, if figu|ratively it means nothing: but poets are wedded to
<PB N="124" REF="130">
fancy, and too often con&s;ider propriety as a mere dome&s;tic, to be employed or di&s;carded at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant acquaints Anna that one of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins is &s;ecured, and produces &s;ome jewels taken from the pri&s;oner, which are &s;trong pre&s;umptive proofs of his guilt. Upon viewing the jewels, Anna di&s;covers the family cre&s;t of Douglas, and goes off to acquaint her lady with &s;o alarming a circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Here an aged pea&s;ant is brought on, a&s;&s;erting his own innocence and ignorance of the crime laid to his charge: upon Lady Randolph's entrance, we find, that &s;he expects to hear how her child peri&s;h|ed; the old &s;hepherd &s;olicits Lady Randolph's pro|tection from the torture with which he is threatened, which &s;he grants, on condition that he truly relates the manner of his obtaining the jewels found upon him; this he would gladly evade, but through fear of compul&s;ion, enters upon the narration, which we think happily related, and the following de&s;criptive lines we particularly approve.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; whil&s;t thus we poorly lived,</L>
<L>One &s;tormy night, as I remember well,</L>
<L>The wind and rain beat hard upon our roof;</L>
<L>Red came the river down, and loud and oft</L>
<L>The angry &s;pirit of the water roar'd.</L></Q>
<P>From Norval's tale it appears, that he found a child floating in a ba&s;ket, that he brought up the child as his own, keeping from him every idea of noble birth; that this adopted &s;on had left him &s;ome days, purpo&s;ing for the camp, and that he was following to deliver him the jewels that were found in the ba&s;ket, as from them the real lineage of his charge
<PB N="125" REF="131">
might po&s;&s;ibly be traced. The whole of this rela|tion is well conducted, and free from &s;uperfluity; the interruptions thrown in by Lady Randolph du|ring the progre&s;s of it are natural; and upon full conviction that the young &s;hepherd is her identical child, the bur&s;t of overflowing &s;atisfaction is very de&s;criptive of maternal affection. From Anna's advi&s;ing a prudent re&s;triction of her joy for fear of di&s;covery, and her agitation, Norval &s;ugge&s;ts that &s;he is the daughter of his ancient ma&s;ter, which &s;he acknowledges, as al&s;o that the re&s;cued child is hers. Lady Randolph de&s;ires that the old man, till matters are ripe for a di&s;covery, may go to an old &s;ervant of her father's, who lives retired from the world; and charges him, if he &s;hould meet Douglas, not to ac|quaint him with the di&s;covery that has been made. The&s;e precautions taken, &s;he orders the &s;ervants not only to &s;et the old &s;hepherd at liberty, as being in|nocent, but to conduct him &s;ome part of his way, as reparation for the injury of having detained him as a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>When all are retired but her confidant, the en|raptured mother gives a &s;cope to joy, expre&s;&s;ing her ideas in a plea&s;ing flow of expre&s;&s;ion; and &s;he deter|mines upon an interview with Douglas, not only to indulge her tender feelings, but al&s;o to concert with him proper mea&s;ures for a&s;&s;erting his rank and birth-right. Here Glenalvon enters, with intelli|gence that the Danes are landed upon the Ea&s;t coa&s;t of Lothian: Lady Randolph's remark upon the mi&s;ery war brings to mothers and wives, is plea&s;ing|ly compa&s;&s;ionate. By Glenalvon's ob&s;ervation, that &s;corn from tho&s;e we love is more wounding than the &s;word, the &s;ubject of his pa&s;&s;ion for Matilda ari&s;es,
<PB N="126" REF="132">
which &s;he replies to with &s;en&s;ible and friendly advice, couched in terms of politic complacence; with hypocritical penitence he receives it, and not only promi&s;es to lay a&s;ide his guilty pa&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o to become the guardian of young Norval in the field. Plea&s;ed with this promi&s;e, the lady retires, a&s;&s;uring Glenalvon, that upon &s;uch terms he may rely on her friend&s;hip, or, what is much more than any other degree of reward, the con&s;cious approbation of his own heart.</P>
<P>Glenalvon alone, and fit for mi&s;chief, ca&s;ts off the occa&s;ional veil of virtue a&s;&s;umed for a few moments, and triumphs in the effects he thinks his &s;mooth ar|tifice may work upon the lady. He &s;ugge&s;ts, that his own dependance and &s;ituation are tickli&s;h, where|fore, he determines to make young Norval an in|&s;trument for rai&s;ing jealou&s;y in the brea&s;t of Lord Randolph; &s;o fini&s;hed a ra&s;cal as Glenalvon appears to be, would no doubt be capable of &s;aying, as well as doing any thing vile. Yet his illiberal remark upon the female &s;ex, with which the third act con|cludes, might as well have been omitted.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act, Lord and Lady Randolph are brought forward, conver&s;ing upon the Dani&s;h inva&s;ion; &s;he expre&s;&s;ing female ap|prehen&s;ions, he manife&s;ting the &s;pirit of a brave man. Upon Douglas's entrance, Lord Randolph a&s;ks how he has learned &s;o much of military &s;ciences in the mid&s;t of rural ob&s;curity; this he ac|counts for by a very picture&s;que narration, but ra|ther tedious to that part of an audience, who are not furni&s;hed with a conception as fanciful as the au|thor's; and burthen&s;ome to a &s;peaker who is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of flowing, variable, declamatory expre&s;&s;i|on.
<PB N="127" REF="133">
The account of why his in&s;tructor became a hermit, is, we apprehend, quite &s;uperfluous, and we have a &s;trong objection to the following remark made by Lady Randolph:
<Q><L>There is a de&s;tiny in this &s;trange world,</L>
<L>Which oft decrees an unde&s;erved doom;</L>
<L>Let &s;choolmen tell us why.</L></Q></P>
<P>However &s;trange the world may be, this a&s;&s;er|tion is equally &s;o, having no meaning at all, or a very dangerous one, accu&s;ing eternal ju&s;tice of a partial di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash;De&s;tiny! we need go but a &s;hort time to the &s;chool of rea&s;on for proof that there is no &s;uch principle in the providential &s;cheme of life; wherefore, it cannot be thought har&s;h to con|&s;ider &s;uch a po&s;ition as incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound phi|lo&s;ophy, and rather an in&s;ult upon our &s;ober &s;en&s;es. Let fatali&s;m be buried in the &s;ame oblivion and con|tempt with witches, fairies, gho&s;ts, goblins, and every other phantom of gloomy, troubled minds.</P>
<P>Here &s;everal &s;peeches occur, no otherwi&s;e e&s;&s;ential than to indulge the poet's fancy with unnece&s;&s;ary mention of a warrior who never appears. Indeed, through this whole &s;cene the plot &s;tands &s;tock-&s;till, merely that the hobby-hor&s;e of genius may prance about in the parterres of flowery de&s;cription; this will evidently appear by ob&s;erving, that if all which pa&s;&s;es from the beginning of the fourth act, to the &s;cene between Lady Randolph and her &s;on, was cut out, &s;uch an omi&s;&s;ion would not occa&s;ion the lea&s;t cha&s;m.</P>
<P>Left alone with her &s;on, impatient to make the di&s;covery, &s;he enters upon the &s;ubject, though di|&s;tantly
<PB N="128" REF="134">
at fir&s;t, and invites him to a place of more &s;ecrecy, yet proceeds without removing. The ex|planation of his birth is brought about with &s;ome merit, but the effect of this &s;cene is anticipated, and much weakened by what pa&s;&s;ed between her and the old &s;hepherd in the third act; be&s;ides, the con|ver&s;ation is &s;tretched out to a length which no force of action can &s;upport: feeling &s;hould not be kept long on the &s;tretch, for in &s;uch ca&s;e it mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured|ly dulls.</P>
<P>After the tender tumults of joy &s;ub&s;ide, &s;he tells Douglas of his claim to the ca&s;tle and deme&s;nes which Lord Randolph holds in right of her; then mentions a de&s;ign of putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his birth-right by means of the king; &s;he prudent|ly checks &s;ome impetuous &s;tarts which break forth from him. After advi&s;ing him to conduct him&s;elf &s;till as Norval's &s;on, and to beware of Glenalvon, he retires, leaving her to make a pious and very emphatic &s;upplication to heaven in his behalf; a &s;upplication which could have no effect if de&s;tiny prevailed. The following lines relative to the dif|ficulty &s;he finds to di&s;&s;emble, are very &s;ignificant and plea&s;ing;
<Q><L>&mdash; how do bad women find</L>
<L>Unchanging a&s;pects to conceal their guilt,</L>
<L>When I by rea&s;on and by ju&s;tice urged,</L>
<L>Full hardly can di&s;&s;emble with the&s;e men,</L>
<L>In nature's pious cau&s;e?</L></Q></P>
<P>Lord Randolph, who, from his fir&s;t appearance, has talked of nothing but the Danes and battles, here enters with the &s;ame &s;ubject; wherefore, we think his lady, upon going off, gives him a very
<PB N="129" REF="135">
proper hint, <HI>to talk of war no more.</HI> From what oc|curs between Randolph and Glenalvon we di&s;cover, that the latter has infected his patron and kin&s;man with jealou&s;y; and that Randolph has in a letter from his lady to Norval, appointing a meeting, plau&s;ible proof of what Glenalvon has &s;ugge&s;ted. The villain, with great depth of policy, advi&s;es Lord Randolph to wait for more particular proof, and for that purpo&s;e to forward the intercepted bil|let to the young &s;wain, that by watching their mo|tions he may have ocular demon&s;tration of their behaviour: this coun&s;el the baron approves, while his pretending friend de&s;ires leave to &s;ound Norval on the &s;ubject, as from the weakne&s;s and vanity of youth &s;ome di&s;covery may be made; this bait his lord&s;hip al&s;o catches at, and leaves Glenalvon to pur&s;ue his in&s;iduous purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>By a &s;hort &s;oliloquy it appears, that even he is deceived into an opinion that Lady Randolph enter|tains a criminal pa&s;&s;ion for the young &s;tranger: by premeditate irony, Glenalvon works up the temper of Douglas to warmth, for which his mother's ac|count of the villain has prepared him. The terms run high and reproachful on both &s;ides, till at length their di&s;pute is referred to the deci&s;ion of the &s;word; when Lord Randolph re-entering interpo&s;es, and enjoins peace, demanding al&s;o the cau&s;e of quarrel and offering his arbitration. This, with becoming &s;pirit, Douglas declines; another alternative is then propo&s;ed, that their private quarrel &s;hall re&s;t unde|cided till the fate of war is known; the parties a|greeing to this, the act concludes.</P>
<P>Douglas begins the fifth act with a &s;oliloquy, wherein, though the characters mu&s;t labour under
<PB N="130" REF="136">
&s;trong agitation of mind, yet we meet the author a|gain &s;porting wantonly with his imagination, and al|&s;o introducing the ridiculous, irrational idea of &s;u|pernatural &s;pirits conver&s;ing with mortals, in the re|tirements of night and &s;olitude: we can forgive poets any degree of fiction but this, which we hold pernicious as well as contemptible,</P>
<P>Old Norval wandering in the wood, &s;eeing the fondling of many years, approaches, and notwith|&s;tanding Lady Randolph's caution to the contrary, acco&s;ts him in his real character, and begs excu&s;e for having &s;o long kept him in a &s;tate of ob&s;curity; this tender conde&s;cen&s;ion of the old man, draws af|fectionate expre&s;&s;ions of regard from Douglas, who, with great good &s;en&s;e and humility ob&s;erves, that in his &s;ylvan &s;tate, he learned &s;ome in&s;tructive le&s;&s;ons, which he will ever retain; particularly to treat his inferiors with re&s;pect, remembring that he once was &s;hepherd Norval.</P>
<P>The old &s;hepherd having heard &s;ome de&s;igns a|gain&s;t his young lord's life, warns him of Lord Randolph and Glenalvon, who have vowed revenge; uncon&s;cious of having done any injury, the noble youth is at a lo&s;s to know their in&s;tigation, but pro|mi&s;es to acquaint his mother with the danger, and to take her advice. The old man here admini&s;ters a ble&s;&s;ing, and retires.</P>
<P>Again the hero of our piece &s;oliloquizes in a lux|uriant, poetical, and therefore, for his &s;ituation, un|natural &s;train. There is an elevation of &s;pirit in &s;ome of the&s;e &s;entiments well worthy a great mind; but others are trifling excur&s;ions of a luxuriant mu&s;e. Lady Randolph entering, a conver&s;ation fol|lows, in which her &s;on repeats what old Norval in|formed
<PB N="131" REF="137">
him of; from this &s;he draws fearful appre|hen&s;ions that the &s;ecret of his birth is di&s;covered, and that he con&s;equently &s;tands in much danger; for which rea&s;on &s;he advi&s;es him to &s;eek the camp, which he with a courageous glow of mind di&s;dains, and propo&s;es to drive the treacherous &s;poilers from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The fond mother admires his intrepidity, yet fearing for his life, and a&s;&s;uring him of her own &s;afe|ty, &s;he per&s;uades him to &s;eek his kin&s;man Lord Douglas, in the camp; this, after &s;ome he&s;itation, he complies with, and in compa&s;&s;ion to maternal fears, promi&s;es he will re&s;train his ardor in the ap|proaching fight, as far as the honour of his endan|gered country and great name will admit. Here, as the mother and &s;on are affectionately &s;eparating, Lord Randolph comes forward, with his murderous a&s;&s;o|ciate Glenalvon; however, di&s;daining a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, the baron determines to attack him &s;ingly, and for that purpo&s;e follows Douglas, while Glenalvon remains, and di&s;clo&s;es his intention of fini&s;hing them both.</P>
<P>A &s;cuffle and cla&s;hing of &s;words is heard behind the &s;cenes, which calls Glenalvon off to execute his fell purpo&s;e. Lady Randolph enters in wild con|fu&s;ion, and &s;oon after Douglas, having di&s;armed Lord Randolph, and &s;lain Glenalvon, returns, but not before the bloody villain had effected the de&s;ign of treacherou&s;ly &s;tabbing him. This incident pro|duces a &s;hort &s;cene of melting tendency, and every generous mind mu&s;t give a tear of pity to &s;uffering virtue. Upon her &s;on's decea&s;e, Lady Randolph very naturally lo&s;es &s;en&s;ation &s;ome moments, through exce&s;s of grief; during which interval, her hu&s;band receives the painful intelligence from Anna,
<PB N="132" REF="138">
that he who was deemed a rival, was his wife's &s;on. This throws Randolph into deep concern; when the unhappy mother revives, &s;he gives &s;ome vent to woe in frantic, disjointed expre&s;&s;ions, and preci|pitately hurries off the &s;tage to make way for old Norval, who comes to view and weep over the me|lancholy &s;cene; being checked by Lord Randolph for intru&s;ion, his grief vents it&s;elf at large, in terms of bitter lamentation, over the cor&s;e of Douglas. Anna, who followed her mi&s;tre&s;s, returns with the lamentable intelligence of her having clo&s;ed a wretched life, by precipitating her&s;elf headlong from a rock; this heaps additional woe upon her hu&s;|band's head, who con&s;idering him&s;elf as the princi|pal cau&s;e of her di&s;traction, re&s;olves, after giving Anna directions for all funeral re&s;pect, to ru&s;h into the field of war, wi&s;hing never to return.</P>
<P>Thus ends a piece which has regularity of plot and unity of action to recommend it; the incidents are few, and &s;ome trifling; the &s;cenes long, and in &s;everal places they run too much into a flattening &s;imilarity; the &s;entiments are moral and poetical, but want originality; the language is ea&s;y and cha&s;te, and the ver&s;ification well broke for tho&s;e who &s;peak the parts to avoid monotony; the number of characters is &s;mall, hence &s;ome weight on action, however they are well cho&s;en and uniformly &s;up|ported; time and place are al&s;o adhered to &s;trictly enough.</P>
<P>Lord Randolph is &s;o &s;ituated, that we can hardly collect the component parts of his character; from what are di&s;tingui&s;hable, he &s;eems to be a lover of his country, a friend to merit, and as far as his la|dy's coldne&s;s will allow, a tender hu&s;band; brave,
<PB N="133" REF="139">
but weak; with a heart to oppo&s;e and conquer open foes, but wanting a head to di&s;cern and counteract &s;ecret ones. Till the touch of jealou&s;y he feels in the fourth act, and the la&s;t &s;cene, what he &s;ays is entirely compo&s;ed of unimportant declamation; it is not ea&s;y for an actor to render him plea&s;ing to any audience, repre&s;enting him may be called rowing a|gain&s;t tide; wherefore, Mr. YOUNGER, who was the original at EDINBURGH, and Mr. RIDOUT in LONDON, both merited prai&s;e for &s;teering clear of offence; yet &s;o far as recollection will authorize compari&s;on, we think it a duty to place Mr. JEF|FERSON foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>Glenalvon is, as we have already ob&s;erved, a horrid picture of deformed humanity, capable of vile actions upon the &s;lighte&s;t views. The author has in working up this part, mingled &s;ubtlety with &s;pi|rit, and given a capable performer favourable op|portunities to gain from humane feelings the ap|plau&s;e of dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>Mr. LOVE, the fir&s;t murderer of this murderous villain, was hateful indeed; not from marking the character with propriety, not as Glenalvon, but as him&s;elf; there never was &s;ure a more rumbling, in|&s;ipid, uncharacteri&s;tic exhibition &s;ince the days of The&s;pis. Mr. SMITH was a very great contra&s;t to this gentleman, yet as much out of character; one growled like a thunder &s;torm, the other &s;impered like an April fit of &s;un&s;hine. Mr. PALMER has capacity, well in|&s;tructed and re&s;trained, to do Glenalvon with pro|priety; but if the play could be otherwi&s;e adequate|ly ca&s;t, Mr. REDDISH would certainly do him that ju&s;tice he has hitherto been wronged of, and give the
<PB N="134" REF="140">
author's full meaning with &s;uitable force to an au|dience.</P>
<P>Douglas is drawn an object of great re&s;pect, as to his filial, &s;ocial &s;entiments, and peculiarly &s;o for his ideas of glory; but the author too often &s;peaks in this part, forgetting character. The young hero's &s;ituation is intere&s;ting, and his fall claims pity, but we wi&s;h it had been effected by &s;ome other means, or rather that he had been &s;aved, as his death is a violent breach of poetical ju&s;tice, and might have been avoided, even to an amendment of the plot. There is &s;ome fire and con&s;iderable pathos in him, yet we think if he had &s;aid le&s;s, he would have meant more.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY never &s;hewed le&s;s of capital merit than in this part, almo&s;t the whole of it &s;eemed to drag upon his tongue, for which we can a&s;&s;ign only two rea&s;ons; that he did not think the writing and de|lineation equal to his execution, therefore was neg|ligent; or, which we think mo&s;t probable, the pa&s;|&s;ions not being wrought up to that degree of ex|pre&s;&s;ion in which he excells, the part &s;lipped from him without any perception of his own deficiency.</P>
<P>Mr. DIGGES was extremely plea&s;ing and happy in the narrative and de&s;criptive parts, nor was he any way deficient in the &s;trokes of tenderne&s;s; the author &s;tood very much indebted to this gentleman for the pro&s;perous exi&s;tence of his piece. Mr. BRERETON may walk through it to fill up time be|fore a pantomime or the jubilee, but &s;ure neither the managers, nor he him&s;elf, would wi&s;h to &s;ee the whole of our opinion re&s;pecting this attempt.</P>
<P>Old Norval's &s;implicity, &s;en&s;ibility, and tender fi|delity of heart, engage us deeply in his favour; he
<PB N="135" REF="141">
is extremely well imagined, and fini&s;hed in a ma&s;ter|ly manner. As it is hard for a performer to render Lord Randolph re&s;pectable, &s;o we think it would be difficult to find one of even decent capacity, who could be flat and unaffecting in the old &s;hepherd: Mr. SPARKS di&s;covered judgment and ma&s;terly &s;trokes of acting, but was too mechanical and labo|rious; his &s;implicity wore &s;trong marks of affecta|tion, and his grief, in general, was di&s;coverably pumped up by artificial feelings. Mr. PACKER, avoiding &s;uch faults, and &s;ucce&s;sfully pur&s;uing the path of nature, de&s;erves preference.</P>
<P>Mrs. WOFFINGTON, who&s;e tragic utterance was, in general, the bane of tender ears, never appeared to le&s;s advantage than in Lady Randolph; flat in the calm, and di&s;&s;onant in the impa&s;&s;ioned pa&s;&s;ages; who Mr. HOME might mean the part for originally, we cannot &s;ay, but Mrs. WARD, into who&s;e hands it fortunately fell, did it as much ju&s;tice as the poet or audience could wi&s;h, and de&s;erves the prai&s;e of having exhibited in this tragedy, a very correct and affecting piece of performance.

<HEAD>The CONSCIOUS LOVERS. A COMEDY. By Sir RICHARD STEELE</HEAD>
<P>A Conver&s;ation between Sir John Bevil and his old &s;ervant Humphry, opens this comedy; the ba|ronet &s;eems full of concern about his &s;on, and relates an incident which happened at a ma&s;querade, from whence he draws apprehen&s;ion, that young Bevil is married to, or reproachably connected with a young lady, who was at the forementioned public meeting.</P>
<P>From an ob&s;ervation that Humphry makes, we find that one Mr. Sealand, who&s;e daughter was in treaty of marriage with young Bevil, has taken an alarm, and po&s;tponed the match. Sir John, upon this declares, that to clear up matters he will in&s;i&s;t upon his &s;on's pur&s;uing the contract with Sea|land; and orders Humphry to pump his valet, as po&s;&s;ibly from him they may learn if his ma&s;ter is engaged in any private amour. The prince of poor coxcombs, as the old dome&s;tic calls him, enters in a full flow of &s;pirits, and rallies hone&s;t Humphry, exulting in his own gayer and more unlimited &s;tate of &s;ervitude; the volubility of his expre&s;&s;ion, the vivacity of his remarks, and the humour of his ideas, are a very entertaining combination of plea|&s;antries. The remark he makes of having never taken a mug of beer for his vote&mdash;would every &s;e|nator could &s;ay as much with truth&mdash;is &s;atirical and laughable.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="144">Upon Tom's mentioning that he has a letter from his ma&s;ter to Lucinda, Humphry a&s;ks why he does not ha&s;ten to deliver it; this que&s;tion brings about an explanation that it is not ea&s;y to obtain ac|ce&s;s to her, Mrs. Sealand, the young lady's mother, being aver&s;e to her daughter's match with Mr. Be|vil, through a de&s;ire the old lady has of matching Lucinda to a relation of her own; this intelligence, it appears, the loquacious valet has received from one Mrs. Phillis, a chambermaid, who, as he in&s;i|nuates, looks on him with a very tender eye, and therefore lets him into the &s;ecrets of the family. Upon the appearance of this &s;econd-hand lady of fa&s;hion, Humphry retires, nau&s;eated with the party-coloured beau's intolerable vanity.</P>
<P>A &s;cene of very peculiar &s;pirit here en&s;ues between the valet and waiting-woman; their affected polite|ne&s;s, their jealou&s;y, and reconciliation, make up a ju&s;t and amu&s;ing picture of their &s;phere in life, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for mimic gentility. When their own concerns have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, Tom recommends his ma&s;ter's letter for delivery to Phillis's care; encou|raged thereto by a hand&s;ome bribe, &s;he undertakes the matter, and concludes the &s;cene with two lines which have more of plau&s;ibility than &s;trict truth to recommend them.</P>
<Q><L>They may be fal&s;e who langui&s;h and complain,</L>
<L>But they who part with money never feign.</L></Q>
<P>A multitude of melancholy in&s;tances prove, that in affairs of gallantry, money is often freely parted with to promote the mo&s;t culpable, vile&s;t purpo&s;es, of which deceit and treachery are the ba&s;e founda|tion;
<PB N="139" REF="145">
however, the maxim is natural enough for a chamber-maid, who wi&s;hes fees at any rate.</P>
<P>We next meet young Bevil in his &s;tudy alone, meditating on the difficulties his propo&s;ed marriage throws him into, and remarking, that his only hope is Lucinda's refu&s;al of the match. This plea&s;ing expectation he entertains for two rea&s;ons; fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e &s;he is pre-engaged to Myrtle; and next, be|cau&s;e he has by letter acquainted her with his incli|nation towards another: collecting re&s;olution from this favourable view of matters, he determines to declare a readine&s;s of con&s;ummating the nuptial rites, according to his father's earne&s;t de&s;ire. When he has thus prepared him&s;elf for an interview, Sir John approaches, and enters upon the matrimonial &s;ubject, expre&s;&s;ing great &s;atisfaction at his &s;on's du|tiful acquie&s;cence; the young man propo&s;es imme|diately waiting on his bride, but the baronet waves that, as knowing Sealand is not in a favourable mood of mind to &s;ee his intended &s;on-in-law; there|fore, he leaves Humphry as a &s;py upon his &s;on, and ha&s;tens to put Sealand into better temper.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner does Sir John di&s;appear, than Hum|phry, with a faithful, ingenuous openne&s;s of temper, mentions to his young ma&s;ter a lady that gives the old man pain. This draws from Bevil a confiden|tial confe&s;&s;ion, and in an extreme pretty, well con|ducted tale, he relates the di&s;tre&s;sful hazards Indi|ana, a lady whom he had &s;een and conceived a pa&s;|&s;ion for on his travels, experienced from the lo&s;s of parents, friends, and the villainy of one who was left her guardian, but would have proved her de|&s;troyer.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="146">The circum&s;tance of Bevil's meeting her on the brink of impri&s;onment, his humane, generous deli|verance by concealed bounty, and his conducting her &s;afe to England, on the mo&s;t honourable and di&s;intere&s;ted principles, place him in a very favour|able point of view. Upon Humphry's a&s;king whe|ther it was the young lady's pa&s;&s;ion for him, or his for her, that gave him an aver&s;ion to the match of his father's propo&s;ing, he gives him an an&s;wer that &s;hews him rather uncommonly refined in his notions, never having once hinted to her the warm intere&s;t &s;he claimed in his heart; and this re&s;erve he imputes to an inviolable filial re&s;pect, which checks him from entering into any engagement that might prove di&s;agreeable to Sir John.</P>
<P>Upon being informed that Mr. Myrtle is at the next door, and would be glad of a conference, he expre&s;&s;es readine&s;s to receive him; then a&s;ks Tom for an an&s;wer to his letter, who informs his ma&s;ter he was de&s;ired to call again. Here Humphry with|draws, dropping the &s;atisfactory hint, that there is a &s;ecret impediment which will check the dreaded marriage with Lucinda. Bevil agreeably feels for his friend Myrtle's unea&s;y &s;ituation, judging of it from his own; and concludes the act with a rhim|ing couplet, which would have been much better turned into pro&s;e.</P>
<P>Myrtle being introduced by Tom at the begin|ning of the &s;econd act, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with &s;ome degree of re&s;entment, on the &s;ubject of rival&s;hip to young Bevil, who endeavours, by proper degrees, to explain the &s;tate of affairs; however, Myrtle, &s;purred by a kind of jealou&s;y, rather warms, from a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of Bevil's meaning. At length
<PB N="141" REF="147">
they come to under&s;tand one another, and a third per&s;on is mentioned as a formidable rival, who though old and an egregious coxcomb, &s;tands a fair chance of &s;ucce&s;s. After &s;ome doubts ari&s;ing, as coun&s;el are to be con&s;ulted, it is re&s;olved, that Myrtle and Tom &s;hall a&s;&s;ume the appearance of the law|yers employed, and thereby delay matters at lea&s;t. This point &s;ettled, Myrtle goes off, and leaves Bevil to his ju&s;t and friendly reflections upon the perplexed &s;tate of Indiana, whom he re&s;olves to vi|&s;it; generou&s;ly, as well as &s;en&s;ibly remarking, that though filial duty will prevent him from ever mar|rying contrary to his father's inclination, yet that duty does not deter him from the innocent company of a virtuous woman, who is particularly agreeable to him.</P>
<P>The &s;cene changing to Indiana's lodgings, &s;he and her aunt I&s;abella come forward, conver&s;ing upon the behaviour of Bevil, which appears intere&s;ted and de|&s;igning to the former, totally generous and honour|able to the latter. I&s;abella &s;peaks with more pre|caution and knowledge than her neice, but Indiana expre&s;&s;es the genuine gratitude and delicacy of a good and &s;u&s;ceptible mind; in the full flow of which, &s;he produces a fre&s;h in&s;tance of his benevo|lence, two hundred and fifty pounds in bank notes, to pay for a new &s;et of dre&s;&s;ing-plate.</P>
<P>After an altercation of con&s;iderable length, in which Indiana defends her admirer with rea&s;on, af|fection and delicacy, her aunt &s;till per&s;everes in a &s;u&s;picion of danger, and, even continues her doubts till Indiana's re&s;entment is rather wrought up, and
<PB N="142" REF="148">
leaves her to make &s;ome old maidi&s;h reflections upon the perils waiting un&s;u&s;pecting innocence.</P>
<P>Indiana immediately re-enters, and having been informed of Mr. Bevil's approach, orders his ad|mi&s;&s;ion, previous to which &s;he reflects upon an alteration in behaviour, a re&s;erve a&s;&s;umed &s;ince the report of his marriage; however, love at his ap|pearance bani&s;hes all doubts, he appears inno|cently amiable in her eyes, and their encounter is &s;uch as may be properly expected from per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and true politene&s;s. The conver&s;ation at fir&s;t is employed upon matters merely indifferent; at length, the &s;ubject turns upon the e&s;&s;ential dif|ference of love and e&s;teem, upon which topic &s;ome agreeable remarks occur.</P>
<P>At length an opportunity offers for Bevil to &s;hew a feeling of heart extremely recommendatory, that of not being content with barely recompen&s;ing merit, but treating it with re&s;pect al&s;o; this intro|duces for Bevil's opinion the di&s;pute Indiana has had with her aunt, whether a man who confers favours on a woman he is no way allied to mu&s;t not be in|tere&s;ted; Bevil's an&s;wer in the affirmative, rather puzzles the young lady, who is evidently endea|vouring to work out &s;ome explanation relative to her&s;elf; however, this is evaded on his &s;ide, till, at length, probably from an apprehen&s;ion of what her drift is, he retires &s;omewhat abruptly.</P>
<P>At this juncture I&s;abella returns, and &s;oftens her neice's doubts concerning the real bent of Be|vil's heart, but declares it nece&s;&s;ary for further &s;atis|faction and &s;afety, to find out whether Mr. Bevil and Mr. Myrtle are really friends or rivals; India|na,
<PB N="143" REF="149">
wrapping her heart in confidence of her lov|er's faith, concludes this act, as every act of this piece cen&s;urably does, with rhime; and that, to &s;ay truth, neither very &s;ignificant nor poetical.</P>
<P>Tom and the volatile ludicrous object of his ad|miration meet and open the third act; but not|with&s;tanding a free, kind &s;alutation from him, the coquetti&s;h jade to&s;&s;es up her no&s;e, and pa&s;&s;es him with an air of quality di&s;dain; &s;tung with this treatment, and knowing her di&s;po&s;ition, he deter|mines upon a&s;&s;uming airs al&s;o, and the repartee of flirtation is bandied about for &s;ome time with equal dexterity on both &s;ides; at length, the &s;wain &s;oftens, and relates with much natural whim, the impor|tant day and hour, and manner of his falling in love; this, after a few taunts and con&s;equential airs, &s;oftens the nympth into an acknowledgement, that her lover's eloquence is very forceable; and &s;he then acquaints him with the effect of his ma&s;ter's letter; how happy it has made Lucinda, giving him al&s;o one in return.</P>
<P>Tom applauds their negotiation, as &s;omething may be derived from it for their mutual advantage and &s;ettlement; here the interview takes a very &s;oft, amorous turn, and &s;ome ki&s;&s;es are &s;eemingly ra|vi&s;hed by Tom, for which his mi&s;tre&s;s gives a faint repul&s;e, acquainting him with the different views of Mr. and Mrs. Sealand, re&s;pecting Lucinda's wed|ding, then archly de&s;ires him to give her but one ki&s;s more; after which they take leave of each other with great and laughable ceremony.</P>
<P>Lucinda, upon her entrance, enquires of Phillis who &s;he has been hurrying off, and receives for an|&s;wer,
<PB N="144" REF="150">
a &s;weetheart; here the young lady, we ap|prehend, de&s;cends a little out of her &s;phere, by ob|&s;erving, that &s;he has heard &s;omething like ki&s;&s;ing; to which Phillis makes a facetious and ingenuous reply; this draws on mention of Cimberton, and the &s;pirited chambermaid a&s;&s;erts, that he is as much married to Lucinda as quality generally are, that is, by con&s;ent of friends, &s;ettlements and other pecuniary agreements. In the progre&s;s of this con|ver&s;ation, we di&s;cover that Myrtle, who&s;e preten|&s;ions were once favoured by the young lady's pa|rents, has won her heart; the account &s;he gives of her mother's re&s;erved peculiarity is plea&s;ant enough; Phillis, who &s;eems to be the friend of her young mi&s;tre&s;s's inclination's declares, that by li&s;ten|ing &s;he has di&s;covered the whole of Mrs. Sealand's de&s;ign in favour of Cimberton; particularly the means u&s;ed to gain con&s;ent from a rich uncle of his, &s;tiled Sir Geoffery. Upon the approach of Mr. Cimberton and her mother, Lucinda puts Phillis off the &s;tage; the old lady opens her own character by &s;ome formal ob&s;ervations upon keeping family blood pure; to which her &s;tarched, antiquated kin&s;|man replies in terms adequately ludicrous; &s;ome of his remarks upon the matrimonial connection are gro&s;s, and not a little heightened in that &s;en&s;e, both by Lucinda and her mother; the Lacedemoni|an in&s;titution and other points being di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, they enter upon the main &s;ubject. Mrs. Sealand point|ing out her daughter to Cimberton as his intended wife; he with his &s;upercilious, philo&s;ophical mode of delivery, &s;peaks of her &s;hape and motions, ac|cording to her own phra&s;e, as if &s;he was a &s;teed at
<PB N="145" REF="151">
&s;ale; another of his remarks of not allowing her a fallow &s;ea&s;on when married, though characteri&s;tic, is ful&s;ome.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sealand being informed that the lawyers are come, orders them to be &s;hewn in; here Myr|tle as &s;erjeant Bramble, and Tom as councellor Tar|get appear; being &s;eated, they enter immediately on the debate; and while the former puzzles the &s;ubject with a verbo&s;e, voluble introduction, the other &s;tammers out impatient interruption till the &s;cene grows very laughable; at length, Cimberton naturally a&s;ks, as not under&s;tanding the purport of their pleading, to have a copy of it in Engli&s;h, this offends Bramble; a very good and &s;atirical &s;troke again&s;t tedious letigation occurs by Bramble's re|ply, when Cimberton de&s;ires to have their opinions without delay,  <Q REND="inline">"that the law will not admit of"</Q> there is con&s;iderable humour in the remark of Tar|get after his opponent is gone; though he has not uttered one perfect word, yet he &s;ays  <Q REND="inline">"I touched him to the quick upon Grimgribber.</Q> This &s;cene has a great deal of &s;pirit and humour, but the in|cident is rather forced and improbable.</P>
<P>Sealand ob&s;erving that men of learned profe&s;|&s;ions &s;hould talk as intelligibly as po&s;&s;ible, which render what they &s;ay of more e&s;timation, Cimber|ton makes this very &s;en&s;ible reply.</P>
<P> <Q REND="inline">"They might perhaps, madam, (gain by it) with people of your good &s;en&s;e; but with the gene|rality it will never do: the vulgar would have no re&s;pect for truth and knowledge, if they were ex|po&s;ed to naked view.</Q></P>
<Q><L>Truth is too &s;imple of all art bereaved,</L>
<L>Since the world will&mdash;why let it be deceiv'd.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="146" REF="152">At the beginning of the fourth act we find Tom in confu&s;ion, and his ma&s;ter chagrined at a kind of a blunder he has made, by letting Myrtle fi&s;h out of him Bevil's having received a letter from Lu|cinda; this, we learn, has produced a challenge from Myrtle to Bevil, for &s;uppo&s;ed double dealing. When Tom, according to order, retires, his ma&s;ter meditates with &s;ome warmth on his friend's precipi|tation; then reads Lucinda's letter, thanking him for declining the marriage, and making him even a confidant of her attention to Myrtle.</P>
<P>Bevil here kindly con&s;iders that &s;ome &s;teps &s;hould be taken to cure the impatience and jealou&s;y of his friend, for which rea&s;on he thinks it prudent to keep the forementioned letter &s;ometime from his know|ledge; having read Myrtle's challenge al&s;o, which is couched in brief and &s;ignificant terms, that gen|tleman appears, and with a peremptory &s;tile, re|quires that notice may be taken of his me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Bevil's reply to this abrupt addre&s;s is &s;en&s;ible and cool, de&s;iring an explanation face to face; the &s;ub|ject, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, ri&s;es fa&s;t, and Myrtle throws out an intimation of timidity, which draws from young Bevil the&s;e truly excellent and moral re|marks, worthy a brave man, and which ought to be &s;tamped upon every forward mind.  <Q REND="inline">"Sir, you know I have often dared to di&s;approve a deci&s;ion the tyrant cu&s;tom has introduced, to the breach of all laws divine and human: I have often told you, in the confidence of heart, I abhorred daring to offend the author of life, and ru&s;hing into his pre&s;ence&mdash;I &s;ay, by the &s;ame act, to commit the crime again&s;t him, and immediately urge on to his tribunal."</Q>&mdash; Read, read, and trea&s;ure up in memory's &s;ecure&s;t
<PB N="147" REF="153">
cell, this &s;alutary in&s;truction, ye &s;avage, vindictive duelli&s;ts.</P>
<P>As there is a bound in every brea&s;t beyond which patience cannot reach, &s;o Bevil, hearing the mo|de&s;t woman of his heart mentioned lightly, takes fire, and accepts the ho&s;tile invitation; here we tremble for good &s;en&s;e, virtue and friend&s;hip, tot|tering on the verge of de&s;truction; however, the author, by a mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;troke, the intervention of Tom, gives Bevil a pau&s;e of rea&s;on, which plea|&s;ingly and reputably brings him to the proper way of thinking. He &s;hews his ra&s;h antagoni&s;t Lucin|da's letter; &s;o convincing a proof of his friend's in|nocence, reduces Myrtle to a degree of pity as well as cen&s;ure; however, the delicate cordiality of Be|vil, anticipates any mortifying conde&s;cen&s;ion from his repentant challenger, and Myrtle is left, in&s;tead of &s;ervile acknowledgments, to make &s;ome very in|&s;tructive ob&s;ervations upon the precipiece they have both e&s;caped, by Bevil's &s;uperior conduct. We con|template this &s;cene with great plea&s;ure, and a&s;&s;ert, that it is as happily conceived, as judiciou&s;ly con|ducted, and as finely written as any other in the En|gli&s;h drama.</P>
<P>Sir John Bevil and Mr. Sealand &s;ucceed the young gentlemen: at the beginning of their conver&s;ation, the baronet &s;eems to plume him&s;elf on genealogy, which the re&s;pectable merchant holds in a cheap light, and rallies Sir John upon it with &s;ome degree of cynical humour. Sealand, in re&s;pect to his daughter's marriage, objects his keeping a mi&s;tre&s;s; this charge, the baronet, like a kind father, endea|vours to exculpate his &s;on of; however, the cit puts the matter to this i&s;&s;ue, vi&s;iting the unknown lady
<PB N="148" REF="154">
him&s;elf; and if, upon the interview, he finds no|thing to confirm his apprehen&s;ions, then there can be no impediment to the match Sir John &s;o much urges, upon this propo&s;al they &s;eparate.</P>
<P>From what pa&s;&s;es between Humphry and his old ma&s;ter, after the Cit is gone, it appears, that Sir John's anxiety is chiefly about Lucinda's large fortune, which at any rate he wi&s;hes his &s;on to ob|tain, the baronet frets very naturally, however re|ceives &s;ome &s;atisfaction from hearing his &s;on's de|claration of never marrying without his con&s;ent; this &s;cene brings about no determination, but leaves matters in a proper &s;tate of doubt.</P>
<P>Phillis in the next &s;cene, acquaints Myrtle that he is in the utmo&s;t hazard of lo&s;ing his mi&s;tre&s;s, Sir Geoffry being hourly expected to compleat the marriage &s;ettlements; this perplexes the lover, when our chambermaid, with the true &s;pirit of in|trigue, advi&s;es him to per&s;onate the old gentleman, this wears &s;o good a face, that he rewards her for &s;o happy a thought, both with money and ki&s;&s;es, concluding the fourth act with a re&s;olution to put her &s;cheme in practice, as well as his di&s;turbed &s;tate of mind will admit.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act Myrtle, meta|morpho&s;ed into the &s;hape of Sir Geoffry, is brought forward by Mrs. Sealand, Lucinda and Cimberton; he a&s;&s;umes the old knights peculiarity of expre&s;&s;ion, as well as his antiquity of &s;hape; Mrs. Sealand, af|ter &s;eeing him &s;eated, goes off to give nece&s;&s;ary di|rections; and is followed by Phillis, that &s;he may give the di&s;gui&s;ed lover an opportunity of being alone with his mi&s;tre&s;s; after &s;ome ludicrous marks
<PB N="149" REF="155">
in the Cimberton &s;tile have been made, Phillis ef|fects her purpo&s;e in favour of Myrtle, by deliver|ing a me&s;&s;age to Cimberton from Mrs. Sealand; this removes him, and the &s;tage is left clear for the lover to di&s;clo&s;e him&s;elf, which he does with &s;uch rapturous precipitation, that through &s;ur|prize Lucinda &s;creams out, which brings back the company; here, upon apprehen&s;ion of a di&s;covery, Myrtle, with very quick addre&s;s, feigns him&s;elf in a fit, which &s;erves as a good apology for Lucin|da's &s;urprize and confu&s;ion; the matter being thus &s;ettled, the &s;uppo&s;ed old gentleman is conduct|ed off. The circum&s;tance of pulling his nephew's ear is farcial to the la&s;t degree, therefore much below the dignity of this piece.</P>
<P>Mr. Sealand, conducted by Humphry to Indi|ana's hou&s;e, next appears, knocks at the door, when Daniel, a high fini&s;hed picture of ru&s;tic &s;im|plicity, furni&s;hed with &s;ome degree of urbanic cun|ning and eva&s;ion, is produced; his an&s;wers to the merchant's enquiry for his mi&s;tre&s;s are replete with humour, and never fail of having a powerful ef|fect; at length, by the help of that argument which &s;eldom fails to influence both the &s;imple and wi&s;e, a bribe, Sealand gains admittance; fir&s;t ob|tains a &s;hort audience of I&s;abella, who recollects him, but does not make her&s;elf known, and then is introduced to Indiana; he addre&s;&s;es her with re|&s;pect, as having &s;ome money to pay her, which cir|cum&s;tance brings on the main &s;ubject, Mr. Be|vil's connection with her; the citizen reproaches that young gentleman with deceiving &s;o de&s;erving a per&s;on, while &s;he, with generous gratitude, vindi|cates
<PB N="150" REF="156">
his honourable conduct; at length, judging Sealand to be his intended father-in-law, her pa&s;&s;ion works up into a &s;well of grief.</P>
<P>In the flow of anxiety for lo&s;ing a man &s;o dear to to her, &s;he indulges her painful feelings with tears, and very naturally recapitulates a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mis|fortunes which have fallen upon her, even from ear|lie&s;t infancy; &s;ome of the circum&s;tances &s;trike Sea|land, who, at length by the circum&s;tance of a brace|let &s;he throws from her, and an enquiry into the real name, he perceives her to be his own daughter; her identity is verified by I&s;abella, and the &s;cene, which is beautifully wrought up, here cau&s;es the mo&s;t plea|&s;ing &s;en&s;ations. The other characters now enter, hav|ing been told the wonderful di&s;covery by I&s;abella, Sir John congratulates the happy father and daughter; by the by, it is a little odd how they &s;hould meet &s;o &s;uddenly at Indiana's hou&s;e, and how Sir John &s;hould know that Sealand intended to give her a fortune equal to his wi&s;hes: however, the author wanted to bring about his cata&s;trophe, &s;o claps Bevil and In|diana together as expeditiou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible. This circum&s;tance depriving Lucinda of half her fortune, Cimberton, who&s;e views were founded more upon intere&s;t than love, gives up his claim, and thereby affords Myrtle an opportunity of throwing off his di&s;gui&s;e, and propo&s;ing his own generous pa&s;&s;ion, which Sealand immediately ratifies with his con&s;ent. Matters thus agreeably &s;ettled, Sir John briefly de|duces from pa&s;t tran&s;actions this excellent moral, That providence &s;uperintends and rewards the per|&s;everance of virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="157">Having pa&s;&s;ed through this comedy with great plea&s;ure to our&s;elves, and we hope &s;atisfaction to the reader, we mu&s;t give its author great prai&s;e, both for his de&s;ign and execution. The plot is regular; intricate, yet obvious; the &s;entiments moral; the language ea&s;y and genteel; there is &s;pirit without licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;urprize without improbability; the characters exhibit nature and variety.</P>
<P>Sir John Bevil, as a fond father, de&s;erves re&s;pect; but there is a &s;elfi&s;h, narrow-minded principle, capa|ble of &s;acrificing even the &s;on he loves to intere&s;t, that greatly lowers our opinion of him; he has nothing to &s;ay but what the mediocrity of Me&s;&s;rs. GIBSON and BURTON may utter decently enough; we have &s;een &s;everal others exhibit the old knight, but &s;o little worth notice that we cannot recollect them.</P>
<P>Mr. Sealand is a plain, unaffected, generous citi|zen; a man of liberal principles without o&s;tentation, and &s;ound &s;en&s;e without pedantry, bred in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity. This hone&s;t citizen was extremely well figured, and &s;uitably performed by Mr. SPARKS; his anxiety, &s;urprize, tenderne&s;s and joy, in the &s;cene where Indiana is di&s;covered to be his long lo&s;t daugh|ter, were well expre&s;&s;ed, and he &s;truck out many ju|dicious beauties. Mr. BERRY, as was u&s;ual with him, mouthed the conver&s;ation, and blubbered the pathetic; and, as to his per&s;onal appearance, it was very ungentleman-like, both in figure and deport|ment. At pre&s;ent, we know not any performer, at either hou&s;e, however &s;trange the a&s;&s;ertion may &s;eem, calculated to do the merchant ju&s;tice; who, though he requires no capital powers, yet calls for judgment and expre&s;&s;ion not ea&s;ily found. We are by no means fond of Mr. AICKIN's paternal feel|ings;
<PB N="152" REF="158">
nor do tho&s;e of Mr. CLARKE give us much plea&s;ure. Mr. HULL, we apprehend, mu&s;t come neare&s;t him, unle&s;s Mr. BARRY would vouch&s;afe to perform the part.</P>
<P>Young Bevil is drawn a fine pattern for young gentlemen of fortune; virtuou&s;ly generous, coolly brave; a di&s;intere&s;ted lover, a dutiful &s;on, and a &s;incere friend. He has been &s;tiled  <Q REND="inline">"a faultle&s;s mon&s;ter, which the world ne'er &s;aw;"</Q> but we can|not find any rea&s;on for &s;uppo&s;ing that an author, though he ornaments a character with many valua|ble qualifications, pre&s;ents him to view as perfect; and &s;uch a man as young Bevil might have not only &s;ome weakne&s;s, nay &s;ome vice about him, though the circum&s;tances of this play don't call either into action.</P>
<P>To carry recollection back as far as we are able, with any degree of preci&s;ion, we remember Mr. QUIN, when he was big enough to do Fal&s;taff with|out &s;tuffing, rumbling forth this part with very near as great pompo&s;ity as he &s;ounded Cato with; a major wig, as in the <HI>young</HI> Chamont, graced his large head; and though young Bevil mentions gaiety of dre&s;s, by calling his cloaths the &s;plendid covering of &s;orrow, yet this <HI>great</HI> actor once, per|haps oftner, ornamented the part with the very cloaths which he played the Old Batchelor in.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN barked out young Bevil &s;everal years in DUBLIN with great applau&s;e&mdash;a notable proof of critical judgment in the audience there&mdash; for, beyond every degree of di&s;pute, he was not fur|ni&s;hed with any one requi&s;ite; the &s;nap of his ex|pre&s;&s;ion, the &s;tiffne&s;s of his deportment, with the natural alternate &s;queaks and croaks of his unhappy
<PB N="153" REF="159">
voice, were &s;uch a group of impediments, as never before incumbered an audience, or lowered an actor of any e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Mr. ROSS, when fir&s;t he played the character at Drury Lane, was as correct, ea&s;y, &s;pirited and gen|teel, as critici&s;m could wi&s;h; he looked, moved, and &s;poke like a gentleman. From what we have &s;een of him lately, he is grown too corpulent for the requi&s;ite freedom, and too carele&s;s for the e&s;&s;ential &s;pirit; performance &s;eems rather a fatigue to him, and any trace of that mu&s;t be injurious to &s;uch a part as young Bevil. Mr. FLEETWOOD, who has left the &s;tage &s;ome few years pa&s;t, had a great deal of merit in this character; his figure, manner, and delivery, all corre&s;onpded to place him in a very fa|vourable light.</P>
<P>Mr. REDDISH is much the mo&s;t capable at pre|&s;ent, as Mr. BARRY's age de&s;troys the merit he once had.</P>
<P>Myrtle has no particular characteri&s;tical di&s;|tinction, his principles appear generally good, his temper &s;omewhat warm; he requires more acting than Bevil, as he a&s;&s;umes different &s;hapes, a volu|bility is wanting for Bramble, a low comedy feeble|ne&s;s for Sir Geoffry. Mr. RYAN, allowing for age and oddity, was not at all ami&s;s in per&s;onating of him: Mr. SMITH is no way di&s;plea&s;ing, nor in any &s;hape capital: Mr. JEFFERSON is faint indeed: Mr. LEE through the whole cha&s;tely excellent.</P>
<P>Cimberton is a coxcomb of peculiar mold, face|tiou&s;ly con&s;equential, ludicrou&s;ly &s;ententious; his vein of humour is not hard to hit, and his words &s;peak for them&s;elves; however, we have &s;een him con&s;iderably flattened in performance. Mr. SHU|TER
<PB N="154" REF="160">
is too luxuriant, Mr. LOVE too dry, yet both have con&s;iderable merit; there was a medium be|tween the&s;e two gentlemen which Mr. TASWELL ex|hibited, thereby irre&s;i&s;tably working upon the comic feelings.</P>
<P>There never was a better drawn coxcomb of the party-coloured corps than Tom; the outlines are highly natural, and the fini&s;hing exqui&s;ite. If an actor has any merit in the fop ca&s;t, he mu&s;t give plea&s;ure in this part, there is a pert <HI>jen &s;e quoy</HI> about him truly diverting: it is &s;aid this part and Phillis were added to the piece by Mr. CIBBER; if &s;o, it is indebted to him for a very happy addition of vi|vacity; we have &s;een his &s;on perform it with con|&s;iderable plea&s;ure, but think he rather grimaced it too much; the &s;ame fault we find with Mr. WOODWARD, yet allow his &s;tudied deportment more ju&s;tifiable in this than many other parts, be|cau&s;e affected gentility will plan attitudes, while real grace of figure and motion proceeds from what Dr. JOHNSON calls &s;pontaniety. Mr. DYER, by help of a &s;ong, has &s;kipped through the valet agreeably enough; but for the author's meaning, and nature without any trick, we mu&s;t appeal to the animated critical execution of Mr. KING.</P>
<P>Daniel, as we have already intimated, is a mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;impleton, as well written for the length of him as any part in the piece, and though &s;o &s;hort a time in &s;ight, is by many of an audience longe&s;t remembered. Mr. HAMILTON well de&s;erves ap|plau&s;e for the <HI>navit&eacute;</HI> of his expre&s;&s;ion, but nature's own comedian, Mr. WESTON, is droll beyond every degree of conception; tho&s;e who have not &s;een or heard him mu&s;t fail of an adequate idea. Mr. WALDRON has lately &s;lipped into his &s;hoes, but hob|bles mo&s;t horribly &s;lip-&s;hod.</P>

<HEAD>KING JOHN. A TRAGEDY: By SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Play opens with peculiar dignity, being the royal audience of a French amba&s;&s;ador, who&s;e very in&s;olent addre&s;s and arrogant demands, are re|plied to with &s;uch &s;pirit as we wi&s;h Briti&s;h monarchs upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion may ever &s;hew. From an ob&s;ervation made by the queen mother, upon Cha|tillion's departure, it appears, that the kindling flame of war has been lighted by Lady Con&s;tance, in favour of her &s;on Prince Arthur, who&s;e ju&s;t title the queen &s;eems to admit.</P>
<P>Robert Falconbridge, and his brother Philip, are introduced for King John's deci&s;ion concerning a plea of birth-right, Robert urging ba&s;tardy again&s;t his brother. Philip's blunt, &s;portive method of expre&s;&s;ion, tainted too with licentiou&s;ne&s;s, is abo|minable &s;tuff for the ears and re&s;pectful decorum of royalty to be violated with; however, from tracing &s;ome marks in his vi&s;age of that corrupt de&s;cent he &s;eems to boa&s;t, after a &s;light altercation, the matter is &s;ettled thus; heritage of the paternal e&s;tate is granted to the legitimate brother, and Philip, with an invitation to join the warlike preparation, is knighted and confirmed in ba&s;tardy, by being or|dered to take the royal name of Plantagenet.</P>
<P>After King John goes off, declaring his immedi|ate intentions of invading France, our new made
<PB N="156" REF="162">
knight &s;tays behind to meditate upon the change of his &s;ituation, which he does in a &s;oliloquy of very quaint conceit; burthen&s;ome to an audience, be|cau&s;e three-fourths of it is unintelligible to the ge|neral ear; and indeed, if not, is of very immaterial tendency. What en&s;ues between this &s;lighty blade and his mother, only &s;erves to confirm what the king and queen took as fact, merely from appre|hen&s;ion.</P>
<P>We cannot think our author had any kind of rea|&s;on for bringing Lady Falconbridge before an au|dience to confe&s;s her &s;hame with &s;uch effrontery, therefore cen&s;ure this &s;cene highly; and are of opi|nion, that the la&s;t &s;even lines of this Act, &s;poken by the Ba&s;tard, are much more &s;uitable to the bully of a brothel, than a per&s;on of good &s;en&s;e, good breed|ing, and real &s;pirit. This character might have been marked with oddity, as is evidently intended, without &s;o much offence.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, by poetical conveyance, we meet the French king and his pow|ers before the walls of Angiers, where Con&s;tance and her &s;on Arthur, yield him thanks for e&s;pou&s;ing their di&s;tre&s;sful cau&s;e. Upon the arrival of Chatillion, his ma&s;ter is informed not only of King John's war|like re&s;olution, but that he has cour&s;ed him at the heels with &s;uch unaccountable expedition, as to be within the &s;ound of beaten drums. We apprehend the play would have begun with much more pro|priety at this period, and there is not a &s;ingle pa&s;|&s;age in the fir&s;t act, &s;ave King John's reply to Cha|tillion, that could cau&s;e ta&s;te or judgment to lament the omi&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="163">Upon meeting his brother of France, King John fir&s;t utters peace, and then, on refu&s;al, denounces war. To this the French monarch replies by argu|ments, in favour of Arthur's right; an altercation en&s;ues, in which the ladies join, without &s;eeming to have the lea&s;t regard for e&s;&s;ential delicacy: what pa&s;&s;es between Au&s;tria and the Ba&s;tard al&s;o, is fitter for coalheavers than men of rank and education.</P>
<P>Upon a propo&s;ition of &s;urrendering all his domi|nions in right of Arthur, John treats King Philip with contempt, but offers protection to the young prince; this brings on a fre&s;h brawl between the ladies; at length, the citizens of Angiers being &s;ummoned to their walls by &s;ound of trumpet, the two kings &s;everally addre&s;s them, denouncing threats on each &s;ide. Thus embarra&s;&s;ed, and equally en|dangered, the citizens very prudently intimate, that whoever proves &s;tronge&s;t will prevail with them. This occa&s;ions immediate determination of a battle, for which purpo&s;e both kings go off. Here a &s;cene of tumult, and what we may ju&s;tly &s;tile theatrical confu&s;ion, en&s;ues, alarms! heralds! and a victory; after which the kings again meet, again debate, and &s;till talk in a high &s;train, while Falconbridge flames between them with the &s;pirit of At&eacute;.</P>
<P>After much controver&s;y, to very little purpo&s;e, more than to gratify a di&s;po&s;ition for talking, they agree to unite their powers again&s;t the re&s;i&s;ting town; this &s;harpens the wits of the citizens, who, by way of palliating matters, propo&s;e a match be|tween the Dauphin and Lady Blanche, a Spani&s;h prince&s;s, nearly related to England; which matter being, like all other &s;tate marriages, concluded by &s;udden con&s;ent of parties, without any appeal to
<PB N="158" REF="164">
love, the gates of Angiers are thrown open, and our two kings enter in friendly terms. John promi|&s;ing to alleviate the pain &s;uch a coalition mu&s;t give Con&s;tance, by creating young Arthur Duke of Bretagny, and giving him the Town of Angiers.</P>
<P>Here Falconbridge is again left alone to de&s;cant upon the late tran&s;actions, which he does with keen and ju&s;t &s;atire; there is a &s;ort of word-catching in this &s;oliloquy, &s;ome of the ideas are incumbered with &s;uperfluous expre&s;&s;ion, and the auditor's con|ception is fatigued with blameable ob&s;curity; not|with&s;tanding which faults, we allow it to contain u&s;eful thoughts and lamentable truths, re&s;pecting the influence intere&s;t has upon the highe&s;t as well as lowe&s;t characters of life.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;cene of the third act, as it has been rightly &s;ettled by the able&s;t editors, Con&s;tance ap|pears, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trong and natural re&s;entment again&s;t the French monarch, for entering into paci|fic connections with her enemy King John; &s;he ra|ther rates Lord Sali&s;bury for bringing her the news, and when he propo&s;es her going into the royal pre|&s;ence, &s;he replies with di&s;dainful refu&s;al, pro&s;trating her&s;elf, and making the ground her throne, as &s;he phra&s;es it.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t returned from the Dauphin's nuptials, the two kings encounter this monument of grief. Up|on Philip's mention that &s;o happy a day &s;hall each annual return be kept a holy one, &s;he ri&s;es, and vents her pa&s;&s;ion with much bitterne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion; her widow's cur&s;e in the following terms is awfully nervous, and judiciou&s;ly introduced by the author, as prophetic of what follows.</P>
<Q><PB N="159" REF="165">
<L>Arm, arm, ye heav'ns, again&s;t the&s;e perjur'd kings,</L>
<L>A widow cries, be hu&s;band to me heav'n:</L>
<L>Let not the hours of this ungodly day</L>
<L>Wear out the day in peace, but ere &s;un &s;et</L>
<L>Set armed di&s;cord 'twixt the&s;e perjur'd kings.</L></Q>
<P>Her reproaches to boa&s;ting Au&s;tria are of a very &s;tinging nature, and the Ba&s;tard's continuation of them &s;harpens their pointedne&s;s exceedingly. Mr. POPE, and other commentators, have added &s;ome lines to make the Ba&s;tard's behaviour more ju&s;tifia|ble; but, if we con&s;ider what pa&s;&s;es in the &s;econd Act, we find that Falconbridge indulges a general blunt oddity, that even treads clo&s;e upon the heels of maje&s;ty; indeed, mention of Au&s;tria's having killed his father, is very proper to lay the foundation of hearted re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Pandulph, legate from the Pope, con&s;equently in tho&s;e days a mi&s;chief-making prie&s;t, here enters; and, in terms of peremptory demand, enquires why the then Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury was deprived of his &s;ee: to this King John replies with very be|coming independency of &s;pirit, but we think in ra|ther too har&s;h terms; dignity never &s;its with grace upon abu&s;e. The thunderbolt of papal authority, excommunication, here i&s;&s;ues from the enraged car|dinal, who urges King Philip to &s;upport the church's quarrel again&s;t John; which, after &s;ome tolerable re&s;i&s;tance, and &s;ome well principled arguments, he is at la&s;t per&s;uaded to by the churchman's able &s;o|phi&s;try. This occa&s;ions in&s;tantaneous declarations of ho&s;tility, and &s;o very conveniently are both ar|mies &s;ituated, that without a &s;ingle line to give time for preparation, the battle joins. We apprehend
<PB N="160" REF="166">
that the cardinal and Con&s;tance might have been furni&s;hed with &s;omething to &s;ay, that would have been not only intere&s;ting but of u&s;e, to give &s;ome trace of probability to the time of action.</P>
<P>After &s;ome martial flouri&s;hes, Falconbridge enters, as conqueror of Au&s;tria; we think the lion's &s;kin as a trophy of honour worn by his father, &s;hould be worn by the Ba&s;tard through the remainder of the play. King John having taken Prince Arthur pri|&s;oner, commits him to the care of Hubert; here a few more alarms &s;ucceed, and the Engli&s;h monarch beats the French behind the &s;cenes; after which he comes on with the Queen Mother, &amp;c. orders Fal|conbridge to ha&s;te for England, there to rai&s;e again&s;t his coming taxes or contributions from the &s;everal orders of clergy.</P>
<P>We do not know any pa&s;&s;age, in any piece, that can boa&s;t merit &s;uperior to the method King John takes of working Hubert to the de&s;truction of Ar|thur. His diffidence, his &s;oothing, his breaks, pau&s;es, and di&s;tant hints, are mo&s;t de&s;criptive lines of nature in &s;uch a depraved &s;tate of agitation. What follows we think &s;o rich a regale for poetical ta&s;te, that we &s;hould deem our&s;elves very blameable not to offer it to the reader's palate.</P>
<Q><L>The &s;un is in the heav'n, and the proud day</L>
<L>Attended with the plea&s;ures of the world,</L>
<L>Is all too wanton and too full of gawds</L>
<L>To grant me audience&mdash;if the <HI>midnight</HI> bell</L>
<L>Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,</L>
<L>Sound one unto the drow&s;y race of night:</L>
<L>If this &s;ame were a church-yard where we &s;tand,</L>
<L>And thou po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a thou&s;and wrongs:</L>
<L>Or if that &s;urly &s;pirit melancholly</L>

<L>Then in de&s;pight of broad-ey'd watchful day</L>
<L>I would into thy bo&s;om pour my thoughts.</L></Q>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the approbation we allow to that general excellence which di&s;tingui&s;hes this &s;peech, yet we cannot avoid remarking the two words di&s;tingui&s;hed by Italics. One o'clock in the <HI>morning,</HI> cannot with propriety be &s;tiled the <HI>midnight</HI> bell&mdash;The word <HI>&s;olemn</HI> would remove this objecti|on&mdash;<HI>Had baked thy blood</HI>; to us it appears that me|lancholy is a cold, chilling di&s;po&s;ition of mind; <HI>baked</HI> furni&s;hes an idea of heat, therefore we would &s;ub&s;titute <HI>caked,</HI> as more con&s;onant to the meaning.</P>
<P>After King John has wrought up Hubert to his murderous purpo&s;e, and goes for England, the au|dience &s;till remain in France, to hear Philip lament the effects of his late defeat; and Con&s;tance breath deep lamentation for the captivity of her &s;on. The unhappy mother's plaints are extremely forceable and tender; yet, among&s;t many beauties, we mu&s;t object to that &s;peech wherein &s;he &s;peaks of the court&s;hip of death, in &s;uch figurative extravagance. When Con&s;tance and the French king retire, Pan|dulph works on the Dauphin by &s;ome arguments of deep and probable policy, to retrieve his own ho|nour and that of France, by undertaking the inva|&s;ion of England; furni&s;hing warm hopes of &s;uc|ce&s;s
<PB N="162" REF="168">
from the internal di&s;quiets of King John's go|vernment, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the enraged clergy, plundered by that monarch's order&mdash;A mo&s;t alarm|ing circum&s;tance to churchmen, who, notwith|&s;tanding they preach up contempt of this world, are peculiarly remarkable for coveting and holding fa&s;t its riches.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act, humanity en|counters the painful circum&s;tance of Hubert's com|mi&s;&s;ion to burn out Arthur's eyes, to prevent, by the Ottoman method, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or advancement to the throne; this &s;cene, with re&s;pect to the young prince's part of it, does our author great credit; he has mo&s;t happily traced nature, and has touched the tender feelings in a powerful manner, without &s;train|ing them too much. Hubert's reluctance and pity are well de&s;cribed, the two characters impre&s;s an au|dience with compa&s;&s;ion and e&s;teem, in&s;omuch, that tears of concern and &s;atisfaction alternately flow.</P>
<P>When King John acquaints his peers with his &s;econd coronation, the Lords Sali&s;bury and Pem|broke expre&s;s them&s;elves in very free terms con|cerning that mea&s;ure: the latter complains of Ar|thur's impri&s;onment, and claims his enlargement, which the monarch con&s;ents to, as &s;uppo&s;ing him di&s;patched. Here Hubert enters, and tells the king that his order has been fulfilled: when Sali&s;|bury and Pembroke are told of Arthur's death, they utter &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of vindictive di&s;content, and leave the king to con&s;ider his perturbed, tickli&s;h &s;ituation. At this point of time a me&s;&s;enger enters, and increa&s;es his embarra&s;&s;ment, by an account of the French inva&s;ion, and his mother's death. The warlike operations of this play are conducted with
<PB N="163" REF="169">
a&s;toni&s;hing rapidity, for King John, between the fir&s;t and &s;econd acts, carried an army to France, which he landed before the French king heard of it; and between the third and fourth, the Dauphin lands a formidable power before the Eng|li&s;h know any thing of his approach. After Fal|conbridge is di&s;patched to &s;ooth the di&s;contented lords, Hubert re-enters, to acquaint the king of &s;ome prodigies which have appeared, and the popular confu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by Arthur's death; his de|&s;cription, particularly in the latter part, has &s;ingular merit. The guilty monarch's recriminating upon one he &s;uppo&s;es a ready agent to his &s;anguine or|ders, is highly natural; the wicked always endea|vour to lighten the oppre&s;&s;ive load of a bad con|&s;cience, by throwing part of it upon another: Hu|bert's exculpation of him&s;elf comes favourably from the actor, but has more plau&s;ibility than truth; for his a&s;&s;ertion of a mind free from the taint of any murderous thought, is contradicted by the readine&s;s with which he under&s;tood and coincided with John's meaning; to have rendered him truly amiable, &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages might have been added to &s;ignify, that he only undertook the horrid charge to &s;ave young Arthur; at pre&s;ent he is left a very dubious or ra|ther culpable character.</P>
<P>The unhappy young prince, rai&s;ed to a &s;tate of de&s;paration by his captivity, and other painful cir|cum&s;tances, appears on the battlements of his pri|&s;on, and re&s;olves upon attempting an e&s;cape; but by the fall puts an end to his life. The di&s;con|tented Engli&s;h peers going to meet the Dauphin now enter, and are acco&s;ted by Falconbridge with me&s;&s;age from the king, which they receive with
<PB N="164" REF="170">
haughty terms. Upon &s;eeing Arthur's body, their wrath grows more enflamed, and a &s;olemn vow of vengeance is entered into.</P>
<P>Hubert, with a &s;econd me&s;&s;age from the king, and intelligence that the prince is alive, comes in, when a warm altercation en&s;ues; being &s;hewn the corp&s;e of Arthur, Hubert pathetically a&s;&s;erts his own innocence, yet cannot gain credit from the lords, who openly avouch their de&s;ign of joining the Dauphin: even Falconbridge &s;eems &s;truck with Arthur's fate, and &s;peaks his doubts of Hubert. The picture he draws of the reigning political con|fu&s;ion, is nervous and &s;triking, and merits being of|fered to the reader, but that we have already ex|ceeded in this play the propo&s;ed limits of quota|tion.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, we meet an in|cident utterly di&s;graceful to Engli&s;h annals, King John's re&s;ignation of his crown, and receiving it from Pandulph, as a mean dependancy on the Pope. His &s;ituation might politically require &s;uch a con|ce&s;&s;ion, but any man of even tolerable &s;pirit would rather have died than &s;hame an exalted &s;tation &s;o ba&s;ely; in return for the Engli&s;h monarch's &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, the cardinal goes to &s;top the Dauphin's ho&s;tile operations. Here the Ba&s;tard enters with intelligence that &s;eems to &s;tagger John, who&s;e em|barra&s;&s;ment gives Falconbridge an opportunity of remon&s;trating with great &s;pirit and fire, e&s;pecially again&s;t Pandulph's palliative commi&s;&s;ion; his ar|guments &s;o far prevail, that he receives the royal authority to repel force by force.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene a &s;olemn compact is entered into between the Dauphin and the Engli&s;h lords. Up|on
<PB N="165" REF="171">
the cardinal's appearance, and the communicati|on of his pacific di&s;po&s;ition, the prince, with very becoming judgment and &s;pirit, declines being pro|pertied by the churchman; who con&s;iders no fur|ther than as circum&s;tances relate to his ma&s;ter the Pope. During this parley, Falconbridge demands conference, in which he &s;upports with &s;oldierly de|meanour, the dignity of his king and native land; however, he lo&s;es the gentleman in &s;ome of his re|marks, particularly where he poorly and indelicate|ly puns upon the beating of drums; bluntne&s;s and rudene&s;s are very di&s;tinct operations of temper; good &s;en&s;e approves the fir&s;t, but condemns the la&s;t.</P>
<P>A battle here en&s;ues, during which King John appears, labouring under a heavy indi&s;po&s;ition. Some tidings of great importance are brought by a me&s;&s;enger, but though of the favourable kind, the &s;ick monarch cannot reli&s;h them, but de&s;ires to be conveyed to Swin&s;tead Abbey.</P>
<P>We are now conveyed to the French camp, where we meet Sali&s;bury, Pembroke, &amp;c. in a &s;tate of &s;ur|prize, at the &s;trength, number, and &s;ucce&s;s of King John's arms; to fill them with more a&s;toni&s;hment and confu&s;ion, Melun, a French count, who has received his death's wound, acquaints them with the Dauphin's de&s;ign of cutting off all the revolters who have joined him, in ca&s;e of victory; this de|termines them upon an immediate return to their allegiance, of which the Dauphin is informed, as well as of the fate his expected &s;upplies have met, of being wrecked upon the Goodwin Sands; how|ever, he bears up with re&s;olution, and determines to &s;tand the i&s;&s;ue of another battle.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="172">A &s;cene merely expletive, occurs between Fal|conbridge and Hubert, which is, and we think with ju&s;tice, generally omitted in repre&s;entation; howe|ver, Hubert's account of the king's being poi&s;oned, &s;hould be retained, and might come well enough from Sali&s;bury or Pembroke, ju&s;t before John's en|trance.</P>
<P>We have now brought royalty to the la&s;t thread of life, and are &s;orry to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving, that our author has not di&s;played his u&s;ual force of genius in what the expiring monarch &s;ays; his &s;peeches are too figurative for one in great pain, and are otherwi&s;e far &s;hort of the circum&s;tances; he re&s;igns his breath too in a manner very unfavour|able for &s;tage action; though a mo&s;t abandoned politician, not one pang of a guilty con&s;cience is mentioned, which even in the mid&s;t of di&s;traction, &s;eldom fails to &s;hew it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The king no more, Falconbridge, with com|mendable &s;pirit, urges union of forces, to expel the Dauphin and his invading powers; however, it appears, that lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments have ob|liged that prince to concur in Pandulph's pacific plan, which the Engli&s;h lords and prince Henry &s;eem ready to admit. This draws our piece to a conclu|&s;ion, and the whole is &s;ummed up with this excel|lent and truly Briti&s;h remark, uttered by Falcon|bridge.</P>
<Q><L>Come, the three corners of the world in arms,</L>
<L>And we &s;hall &s;hock them!&mdash;nought &s;hall make us rue</L>
<L>If England to it&s;elf do prove but true.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="167" REF="173">In writing this play, SHAKESPEARE di&s;claimed every idea of regularity, and has huddled &s;uch a &s;eries of hi&s;torical events on the back of one ano|ther, as &s;hame the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of probability; his mu&s;e travels lightning winged, being here, there, and every where, in the &s;pace of a few mi|nutes. We are by no means advocates for that pinching limitation which &s;o di&s;advantageou&s;ly fet|ters modern compo&s;ition; imagination will indulge &s;everal tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of liberty, but mu&s;t be offended when all the bounds of conception are arbitrarily trodden under foot.</P>
<P>In point of characters King John is a very di&s;a|greeable picture of royalty; ambitious and cruel; not void of &s;pirit in the field, yet irre&s;olute and mean in adver&s;ity; covetous, overbearing and im|politic; from what we can ob&s;erve, totally unprin|cipled; &s;trongly tainted with the oppo&s;ite appella|tions which often meet, fool and knave; during his life we have nothing to admire, at his fall nothing to pity.</P>
<P>There is no capital character within our know|ledge of more inequality; the greater part of what he has to &s;ay is a heavy yoke on the &s;houlders of an actor. His two &s;cenes with Hubert are indeed ma&s;terly, and do the author credit; like charity they may &s;erve to cover a multitude of &s;ins; the dying &s;cene is not favourable to action.</P>
<P>Mr. QUIN was the fir&s;t we remember to &s;ee figure away in royal John; and, as in mo&s;t of his tragedy undertakings, he lumbered through the part in a painful manner; growled &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, bellowed others, and chaunted the re&s;t. Mr. CHURCHILL has &s;neered at Mr. MOSSOP for brow-beating the French
<PB N="168" REF="174">
king; had he &s;een and remembered the gentleman under con&s;ideration, he would have thought the poor tame monarch in danger of being &s;wallowed up alive by his voracious brother of England. Mr. SHERIDAN has, no doubt, impaired as his faculties are at pre&s;ent, very &s;triking merit, where he is working Hubert to the murder of the prince; his utterance and attendant looks are highly picture&s;que. We allow him to be al&s;o de&s;erving of prai&s;e where he upbraids Hubert with &s;o readily obeying his bloody orders; but in the other &s;cenes of the four fir&s;t acts, low as they are, he &s;inks beneath them; in dying, he overacts to a degree of particular of|fence.</P>
<P>Mr. MOSSOP, whom we have been obliged to find fault with upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, here de|&s;erves our warme&s;t prai&s;e, and we are happy to give it him. That &s;tiffne&s;s and premeditate method which, in other characters, took off from his great powers and good conception, being le&s;s vi&s;ible in his King John. The rays of glowing merit here broke upon us unclouded and dazzling; where the author's genius &s;oared aloft, he kept pace with equal wing; where Shake&s;peare flagged, he bore him up; wherefore, we are venturous enough to affirm, that no performer ever made more of good and bad materials mingled together, than Mr. MOSSOP did in this play. Mr. POWELL was too boyi&s;h, he want|ed weight and depth of expre&s;&s;ion to excel in John.</P>
<P>Of the chip-in-pottage French king, we &s;hall &s;ay nothing, as no actor can make any thing of him; nor can his &s;on, for the like rea&s;on, de&s;erve much notice. However, we remember two performers that are worth mention, one Mr. LACY, who did
<PB N="169" REF="175">
in the Dauphin than critici&s;m had any right to ex|pect; and Mr. THE. CIBBER, who was undoubted|ly the verie&s;t bantam-cock of tragedy that ever crowed, &s;trutted, and flapped its wings on a &s;tage.</P>
<P>The Cardinal is a very well drawn churchman of tho&s;e times, &s;ubtle, proud, ira&s;cible; rather prone to promote than prevent public calamities, where his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t &s;eems concerned; a mere politician, not incumbered with delicacy of principle, or the feelings of humanity; he is not in favour of the actor, yet appeared very re&s;pectable in Mr. HA|VARD's performance of him, no other per&s;on &s;trikes our recollection.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;tard is a character of great peculiarity, bold, &s;pirited, free&mdash;indeed too free &s;poken; he utters many noble &s;entiments, and performs brave actions; but in &s;everal places de&s;cends to keep at|tention from drow&s;ing, at the expence of all due decorum; and what is very di&s;graceful to &s;erious compo&s;ition, cau&s;es the weaker part of an audience to laugh at &s;ome very weak, punning conceits.</P>
<P>Mr. RYAN had &s;ome merit in this part, by no means equal to what he &s;hewed in many others. The unhappy impediment of his utterance being more con&s;picuous in it than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Mr. SHERIDAN has apologized for it, but from what we have already &s;aid concerning his executive abilities, the reader may ea&s;ily judge how very unlike the character he mu&s;t be. Mr. HOLLAND was too &s;tiff, and made too much u&s;e of his &s;trong lungs. Mr. SMITH is pretty and &s;pirited, but wants weight and bluntne&s;s. We have &s;een one Mr. FLEETWOOD appear in it this &s;ea&s;on, at the Haymarket, with eve|ry
<PB N="170" REF="176">
fault of Mr. HOLLAND improved, and all his &s;trokes of merit dimini&s;hed.</P>
<P>If ever Mr. GARRICK's figure made again&s;t him, it was in this part; he &s;truck out &s;ome lights and beauties which we never di&s;covered in the per|formance of any other per&s;on, but there was a cer|tain petitne&s;s which rather &s;hrunk the character, and cut &s;hort the u&s;ual excellence of this truly great actor. Upon the whole, we are obliged to declare, that our idea of the Ba&s;tard and SHAKESPEARE's meaning, to our knowledge, has never been pro|perly filled. Mr. BARRY, for external appearance and general execution, comes neare&s;t the point. This remark may &s;erve to &s;hew, that though we greatly admire, and have hitherto warmly prai&s;ed our Engli&s;h Ro&s;cius, we are not &s;o idolatrou&s;ly fond of his exten&s;ive merit, as to think him always fore|mo&s;t in the race of fame.</P>
<P>Hubert, though upon the whole an agreeable agent, is by no means an e&s;timable per&s;onage; he appears in a very recommendatory light, and fa|vours repre&s;entation where there are any tolerable feelings. Me&s;&s;rs. SPARKS and BERRY did him very con&s;iderable ju&s;tice, and Mr. BENSLEY has exhibited him with de&s;erved approbation; we cannot &s;ay &s;o much for Mr. GIBSON. At the Haymarket, Mr. GENTLEMAN has pa&s;&s;ed mu&s;ter, as not having mi&s;|conceived or ill expre&s;&s;ed the part; but we cannot, as a public performer, congratulate him much on the happine&s;s of his figure or features.</P>
<P>Prince Arthur is a very amiable and intere&s;ting character of the drama; we have &s;een it done af|fectingly by &s;everal children, who&s;e names we for|get; however recollect being particularly plea&s;ed
<PB N="171" REF="177">
with Mi&s;s REYNOLDS, now Mrs. SAUNDERS, &s;ome twenty years &s;ince.</P>
<P>Who did the revolting lords has entirely e&s;caped our memory, except at Mr. FOOTE's, this &s;ummer, and tho&s;e gentlemen who per&s;onated them there may wi&s;h to be forgot al&s;o.</P>
<P>Every one of the female characters are too con|temptible for notice except Con&s;tance; &s;he indeed &s;eems to have been an object of great concern with the author, and very &s;eldom fails to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon the audience; her circum&s;tances are peculiarly calculated to &s;trike the feeling heart; dull, very dull mu&s;t that &s;en&s;ation be which is not affected with the di&s;tre&s;s of a tender parent, expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch pathetic, forceable terms; even Mrs. WOF|FINGTON, who, from di&s;&s;onance of tones might be called the &s;creech-owl of tragedy, drew many tears in this part; to which her elegant figure and ade|quate deportment did not a little contribute. A fine woman robed with grief, is a leading object of pity.</P>
<P>Mrs. CIBBER, in the whole &s;cope of her great ex|cellence, never &s;hewed her tragic feelings and ex|pre&s;&s;ion to more advantage than in Con&s;tance; there was a natural tendency to melancholly in her fea|tures, which heightened in action, and became &s;o true an index of a woe-fraught mind, that with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her nightingale voice, &s;he became irre|&s;i&s;table; and almo&s;t obliged us to forget every other character in raptured contemplation of her merit.</P>
<P>Mrs. BELLAMY fell far, very far &s;hort of the fore|mentioned lady, and cathedralized the unhappy prince&s;s offen&s;ively. Mrs. YATES and Mrs. BARRY,
<PB N="172" REF="178">
have both powerful capabilities for the part, but can never ju&s;tly hope to equal their great predece&s;&s;or Mrs. CIBBER, who mu&s;t be always remembered with plea&s;ure and regret by all per&s;ons of ta&s;te, who had the happine&s;s to &s;hed the &s;acrifice of tears at the &s;hrine of her melting powers. Mrs. PHIL|LIPPINA BURTON was indi&s;cribably deplorable.</P>
<P>The &s;hameful irregularity of plot we have alrea|dy remarked; in the characters there is variety. The Ba&s;tard is an original and plea&s;ing oddity, though &s;omewhat upon the extravaganza; the lan|guage is bold, flowing, and, where it ought to be, pathetic; yet in many places too figurative, ob|&s;cure and turgid. As to moral, there &s;eems to be no other deduction but this; that King John's crimes having merited his fate, the ju&s;tice of provi|dential di&s;pen&s;ation is thereby vindicated. This play wants much alteration to make it quite agree|able on the &s;tage, and is at pre&s;ent we think a better reading than acting piece.</P>
<P>Before we di&s;mi&s;s this tragedy, permit us to offer a &s;hort anecdote related by a gentleman who &s;aw it performed at Port&s;mouth la&s;t war. The French party coming on with white cockades, a zealous tar &s;houts from the gallery, Harkee, you Mr. Moun|&s;eers, &s;trike the white flags out of your nabs, or b&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; my eyes, but I'll bombard you. A general laugh went through the hou&s;e, but the actors deem|ing it merely a tran&s;ient joke, took no notice; up|on which, our enraged &s;on of Neptune gave the word fire, and immediately half a dozen apples flew, which worked the de&s;ired effect; three cheers en&s;ued, and this incident diffu&s;ed &s;uch a &s;pirit through the hou&s;e, that during the re&s;t of the play loud huzza's attended the exits and entrances of King John's
<PB N="173" REF="179">
party, while King Philip and the Dauphin, notwith|&s;tanding the polite removal of their cockades, &s;u&s;|tained many rough &s;trokes of &s;ea wit.</P>

<HEAD>The HYPOCRITE. A COMEDY altered from CIBBER: By Mr. BICKERSTAFF.</HEAD>
<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the NON JUROR did its author great credit in its original &s;tate, yet we mu&s;t cordi|ally applaud the de&s;ign of turning it into the pre|&s;ent form. The laureat's &s;atire was political, the objects of which being now almo&s;t forgotten, it be|came ob&s;olete; be&s;ides, we always looked on the old piece as heavy for want of &s;uch &s;ea&s;oning as is mingled with this alteration, which we are now a|bout to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>It opens with a &s;cene between Sir John Lambert and the Colonel, his &s;on, who is expo&s;tulating warm|ly again&s;t the influence allowed to Dr. Cantwell: Sir John, the weak pro&s;elyte of enthu&s;ia&s;m, backs his own opinion with &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, and much pre|judice. The conver&s;ation turning upon Mr. Darn|ley's addre&s;&s;es to Charlotte, the baronet objects to that gentleman, as not being pious enough for a &s;on-in-law; and being told of his coming to obtain final con&s;ent, the father determines to go out that he
<PB N="174" REF="180">
may avoid &s;eeing him; declaring, at the &s;ame time, that he has another man in view to marry his daugh|ter. Colonel Lambert is &s;tartled at this informa|tion, and &s;eems to apprehend it may be &s;ome favourite of the Doctor's. Charlotte appearing, he opens the &s;ubject; from her natural vivacity &s;he &s;ports with his grave beginning, till he calls her a giddy <HI>devil</HI>; we wi&s;h the la&s;t word had been changed for a politer one; a lady may, by an ex|travagant admirer, be called a <HI>&s;aint,</HI> and that's &s;uf|ficiently ridiculous, but in plea&s;antry to &s;tile one a <HI>fiend,</HI> is not a mark of good breeding; we know there are precedents, but they don't invalidate our objection, which lies as much again&s;t lack of mean|ing as indelicacy.</P>
<P>On being told that her father is violently again&s;t the match with Darnley, the young lady expre&s;&s;es &s;atisfaction, as &s;he &s;eems to think that difficulties render an amour more engaging: her contempt of the addition her fortune may receive from Sir John's con&s;ent, is &s;pirited, and declaring her&s;elf a fine wo|man, plea&s;ant. When the Colonel mentions that Sir John has a per&s;on in his eye for her, &s;he, with the true feelings of coquetry, enquires who it is, and appears to find great plea&s;ure from the idea of an additional lover. We have a &s;trong objection to what this lady &s;ays when pre&s;&s;ed to a &s;ingle attach|ment in Darnley's favour, notwith&s;tanding the pa&s;|&s;age always creates a laugh; the compari&s;on of her|&s;elf to an <HI>empty hou&s;e to let,</HI> is at lea&s;t vulgar and trite, if not licentious; it is mere gallery wit.</P>
<P>Charlotte, by &s;lipping out an ob&s;ervation of Darn|ley's being rather jealous in his temper, &s;hews that he claims &s;ome degree of her notice, which the Colonel
<PB N="175" REF="181">
remarks: her lover enters, and for &s;ome time &s;he pretends not to perceive him, but repeats, as if in &s;oliloquy, &s;ome poetical lines; the lover pre&s;&s;es to gain her attention. At la&s;t, he makes rather a peevi&s;h remark, and draws upon him&s;elf &s;ome &s;pirit|ed raillery; this gives him a turn, which we think of an ungracious ca&s;t. Mention of a rival agitates Darnley very much, and he makes eager enquiry concerning who the per&s;on is; the Colonel &s;ugge&s;t|ing that it is probably &s;omebody of Cantwell's recommendation, the lover &s;eems to think the Doctor is his friend; Charlotte here takes an odd turn, and makes a whim&s;ical exit, very advantageous to a capable actre&s;s.</P>
<P>After his &s;i&s;ter is gone, the Colonel a&s;&s;ures Darn|ley of being in his mi&s;tre&s;s's favour; and hints, that if Sir John's con&s;ent can be obtained, the Doctor may be brought over by young Lady Lambert, who apparently has great intere&s;t over him, and as &s;uppo&s;ed from amorous motives; this inclination of the Hypocrite for his patron's wife, is going to be accounted for, when the explanation is &s;topped by the appearance of Lady Lambert, Seyward, and the Doctor. Cantwell &s;ets off in the true methodi&s;tical &s;tile of &s;elf accu&s;ation; and ob&s;erving, that he is maintained too luxuriou&s;ly for his &s;piritual welfare, declares his intention of quitting the family for a le&s;s &s;en&s;ual &s;ituation: &s;uch an irreparable lo&s;s &s;hocks her lady&s;hip, who reprobates her&s;elf al&s;o, and there|fore intreats his &s;tay upon the tendere&s;t terms of per&s;ua&s;ion, to promote her thorough reformation.</P>
<P>The Colonel returns with Darnley, when, after reciprocal &s;alutation, the wickedne&s;s of going to plays is brought in view, and the old lady warmly
<PB N="176" REF="182">
&s;econds her gho&s;tly guide. Some words ari&s;ing be|tween the Colonel and Cantwell, the former reproves the latter's in&s;olence with becoming &s;pirit, which &s;acrilegious violence drives off her lady&s;hip, filled with apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome extraordinary puni&s;h|ment for &s;uch violence to &s;o pious a character; and the Doctor him&s;elf retires, with threatning to ac|quaint Sir John. A few &s;peeches intervene, re|&s;pecting the manner of his getting into the family, when he returns, following Charlotte, who &s;eems to be much offended at his intru&s;ion upon her; the Colonel and her lover al&s;o, both expre&s;s re&s;entment at his bolting into her room, without any previous notice; the Doctor pleads Sir John's authority for what he has done, and deports him&s;elf with much haughtine&s;s; Charlotte being que&s;tioned as to the particular offence &s;he has received, gives a plea&s;ant, but we think reprehen&s;ible account of it.</P>
<P>In the following part of this &s;cene, Charlotte a|gain indulges her &s;portive humour with Darnley, who&s;e patience is put to &s;evere trial; however, at la&s;t, &s;he gives him leave to hope. They are inter|rupted and &s;urprized by the entrance of Sir John, who, without uttering one &s;yllable, takes his daugh|ter off the &s;tage in a very abrupt manner: this Co|lonel Lambert imputes to the Doctor, and laments the weakne&s;s of a father, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition and un|der&s;tanding are naturally good; however, he hints having a thought that may prevent the Hypocrite's bringing ruin on the family: &s;o ends the fir&s;t act.</P>
<P>By a &s;oliloquy of Seyward's, at the beginning of the &s;econd, we find he is deeply in Cantwell's &s;ecret tran&s;actions; and he mentions one of his villainous de&s;igns, which appears to be no other
<PB N="177" REF="183">
than cutting off Charlotte, by a deed of &s;ettlement, with a &s;hilling, unle&s;s &s;he marries him. It appears, that Seyward is &s;hocked at this knavery, and &s;ti|mulated by a pa&s;&s;ion he has conceived for the young lady, determines upon u&s;ing his power to prevent the pernicious &s;ettlement from being per|fected. Sir John enters, and &s;ends Seyward off to tran&s;cribe hymns for his &s;uppo&s;ed uncle, the pious Doctor.</P>
<P>Upon Charlotte's &s;peaking in favourable terms of Seyward's good breeding and neatne&s;s, her father up|braids her with not con&s;idering a man's real merit; from whence, after &s;ome grave, preparatory &s;peeches, he explains his intention, and propo&s;es the Doctor, not by name, but de&s;criptively; the young lady rallies, her father's notions of life and matrimony in a &s;en&s;ible and agreeable manner. At length, when he orders her to think no more of Darnley, and plumply names Cantwell, &s;he bur&s;ts into a hor&s;e-laugh; then growing &s;erious, &s;ugge&s;ts an ob|jection which, as &s;he rightly ob&s;erves, is with fathers in general a weighty one, the Doctor's want of for|tune; however, Sir John intimates a de&s;ign of giv|ing him one. The baronet being called by a me&s;|&s;age from his &s;piritual guide, Charlotte confe&s;&s;es to her &s;tep-mother, young Lady Lambert, painful ap|prehen&s;ion of her father's doing any thing that may impair the fortune of her brother, the Colonel, who, upon being informed that his &s;i&s;ter is de&s;tined &s;o: Cantwell, is &s;o enraged, that he hints to Lady Lam|bert the Doctor's pa&s;&s;ion for her, which, upon being pre&s;&s;ed, &s;he acknowledges to have perceived. What Colonel Lambert &s;ays about the Turkey-cocks, might as well have been omitted; the characters
<PB N="178" REF="184">
are too &s;erious for joking here; be&s;ides, the idea con|veyed is not very &s;uitable to mode&s;t ladies.</P>
<P>When the Colonel hears of his father's intention of &s;ettling a fortune on his chaplain, he thinks it time to lay &s;ome plan for the Hypocrite's de&s;tructi|on, and this he throws upon Lady Lambert, re|que&s;ting her to encourage the Doctor's addre&s;&s;es, from which he will devi&s;e the means of overturning all his &s;chemes and influence; this &s;he promi&s;es to con&s;ider of. The Colonel then goes off upon an appointment to meet Darnley.</P>
<P>Old Lady Lambert enters, and complains of Charlotte's wearing thin lace over her brea&s;t, as Dr. Cantwell deems it indecent; Charlotte gives her opinion of the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;aint in pretty tart terms, yet the old lady per&s;everes, and makes the following truly characteri&s;tical remark:  <Q REND="inline">"How has he wean|ed me from temporal connections; my heart is now &s;et upon nothing &s;ublunary, and I thank hea|ven, I am now &s;o in&s;en&s;ible to every thing in this limbo of vanity, that I could &s;ee you, my &s;on, my daughters, my brothers, my grand children, all ex|pire before me, and mind it no more than the going out of &s;o many &s;nuffs of candle."</Q> There never was a better picture of methodi&s;tical philo&s;ophy, which annihilates every trace of &s;ocial feelings to a mi&s;taken, ridiculous &s;pirituality.</P>
<P>Sir John and Cantwell join the old lady, when the baronet, with much &s;eeming anxiety of mind, begs of his mother to join in &s;oliciting the Doctor to &s;tay in his family, from whence the dear creature pre|tends to go, as thinking him&s;elf obnoxious to Sir John's children, con&s;equently the cau&s;e of animo&s;i|ties and di&s;turbances among&s;t the family: this
<PB N="179" REF="185">
plau&s;ible humiliation of mind, plays a deep game of policy, e&s;pecially where he propo&s;es to return Sir John his deed of &s;ettlement, and &s;eems to lament the Colonel's perilous, reprobate &s;ituation. Char|lotte being mentioned, Cantwell imputes her refu&s;al to female mode&s;ty, and thinks &s;he may be wrought upon, but advi&s;es that the matter may re&s;t awhile.</P>
<P>Maw-worm, a new character, and one of the &s;elect, is introduced; as laughable and well-drawn a per|&s;onage as we know. This ignorant, melancholly &s;prig of enthu&s;ia&s;m, is mo&s;t exqui&s;itely delineated, and calls powerfully on the ri&s;ible faculties; if it was not too great an infringement upon our due bounds, we would tran&s;cribe the whole of this ex|cellent &s;cene; to give only a part would be injuri|ous, for there is an admirable connection of plea|&s;antries, the jokes and blunders happily ari&s;ing out of each other. It is much to be lamented that there are &s;o many Maw-worms in real life.</P>
<P>After old Lady Lambert departs, Cantwell gives Seyward &s;ome papers, with an ob&s;ervation to lay them where they may be &s;oon found, as he &s;hall have occa&s;ion for them in the afternoon. This fur|ni&s;hes Seyward with an idea that matters are ripe|ning fa&s;t, &s;o he determines to acquaint Charlotte; &s;he appears, reading Pope's Homer, and a&s;ks &s;ome que&s;tions concerning the original, of which &s;he knows two words. Upon repeating them, and de|&s;iring an explanation, Seyward applies them to his own purpo&s;e, &s;peaking both the original and tran|&s;lation with &s;uch a glow of amorous empha&s;is, that Charlotte takes notice of it. In what follows, he di&s;covers to her, that Cantwell, though &s;uppo&s;ed his uncle, is not really &s;o; then pathetically tells his
<PB N="180" REF="186">
&s;ituation, lamenting that he has joined in any of the Doctor's vile &s;chemes, even by connivance. Char|lotte perceives in the progre&s;s of their interview, that Seyward loves her: when he has acquainted her with the deed of &s;ettlement, containing a provi&s;o of four thou&s;and pounds for her in ca&s;e &s;he marries the Doctor, and a total di&s;inheritance of her brother, her volatility vani&s;hes; &s;he feels &s;eriou&s;ly, and reque&s;t|ing the deed from Seyward, &s;he concludes the act, with de&s;iring him to meet her at a lawyer's in the Temple.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act we are intro|duced into Charlotte's dre&s;&s;ing-room, where &s;he is acquainted by Betty, her maid, that Mr. Darnley had been to enquire for her, and &s;eemed unea&s;y at her not being at home, which &s;he interprets into jealou&s;y, and re&s;olves to teize him. At this unlucky moment he comes, and meets with &s;o whim&s;ical a reception, that he remarks upon it; the colli&s;ion of conver&s;a|tion of two lovers is de&s;cribed here with &s;pirit, a good deal of acid, as Lady Townly calls it, is mingled, and Charlotte very ju&s;tly mortifies the im|patience of her gallant. At length the &s;ubject is waved, and Darnley informs his mi&s;tre&s;s that he has heard from Colonel Lambert, Sir John's de&s;ign of e&s;pou&s;ing her to the Doctor; here the amantium irae breaks out again, and poor Darnley is wound up to a pitiable pitch of unea&s;ine&s;s; he makes an effort to &s;hake off her power, but &s;he plays him &s;o very judi|ciou&s;ly, that he turns &s;oft, and almo&s;t melts her.</P>
<P>When brought to a very critical point of feeling, Seyward's entrance gives Charlotte a very &s;ea&s;onable pau&s;e: what &s;he &s;ays to that young man again a|larms Darnley's jealou&s;y, who que&s;tions him what bu&s;ine&s;s he has with the lady. Colonel Lambert
<PB N="181" REF="187">
enters, and finding his friend &s;trongly agitated, kindly endeavours to talk him into a calm, promi&s;es his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and appoints a meeting in the Park: Charlotte re-enters, and the Colonel a&s;&s;umes his friend's bu&s;ine&s;s directly, but cannot bring his &s;i&s;ter to any &s;atisfactory explanation.</P>
<P>Young Lady Lambert appears, &s;ays &s;he has de|&s;ired a conference with Cantwell, and mentions her determination to give a good account of him. At &s;ight of the Doctor, Charlotte and her brother retire: after a well conducted tete-a-tete with the lady, wherein the lamblike wolf plainly &s;hews his iniqui|tous de&s;ign upon his patron's wife, the Colonel ru&s;hes precipitately in, and menaces di&s;covery to his father; Cantwell, with quick policy, turns his meaning to the love he has for Charlotte. During this confu&s;ion Sir John enters, and is told by his &s;on of the Doctor's paying addre&s;&s;es to Lady Lam|bert; this gives the &s;actified knave an opportunity of working upon the baronet's credulity, with all the plau&s;ible addre&s;s of hypocri&s;y, and &s;o far tri|umphs, that Sir John in rage forbids the Colonel his hou&s;e. Here Cantwell's Chri&s;tian charity art|fully interpo&s;es in favour of his enemy, and he pro|po&s;es a reconciliation, which the Colonel very pro|perly declines; this confirms Sir John in re&s;pect of the &s;ettlement, and gives the Doctor a plea for ac|cepting it, which he declares is only as a tru&s;tee.</P>
<P>Seyward and Charlotte begin the fourth act; by their conver&s;ation we are informed that a deed has been &s;igned in pre&s;ence of the former, who, for his friendly interpo&s;ition, is promi&s;ed favour with re|gard to his own circum&s;tances; however, he hints that intere&s;t was not his motive &s;o much as love:
<PB N="182" REF="188">
the young lady's treatment of him here &s;hews a good under&s;tanding, and a candid mind; &s;he commends his mode&s;ty, avows a previous pa&s;&s;ion, and recom|mends avoiding to play, moth like, about a flame which may be fatal.</P>
<P>After a very characteri&s;tic &s;oliloquy, Lady Lam|bert informs Charlotte that the Doctor, by Sir John's expre&s;s de&s;ire, is coming to be his own ad|vocate for her favour: being introduced by Betty, the chambermaid, Cantwell opens the interview with ob&s;erving, that he con&s;iders him&s;elf as a per&s;on not very agreeable to Charlotte, which opinion &s;he mo&s;t cordially confirms; after receiving her con|temptuous treatment of him with much compo&s;ure, he acquaints her that &s;he mu&s;t not marry without his con&s;ent; then cau&s;es her to confe&s;s an inclina|tion for Darnley, and mode&s;tly offers to favour that propo&s;al, in ca&s;e &s;he gives up half the four thou&s;and pounds allotted for her by Sir John; this &s;he comes into, and receives warning from Cantwell not to at|tempt any prejudice again&s;t him, as any thing of that nature mu&s;t retort upon her&s;elf. When he is gone off, a &s;hort &s;cene occurs, wherein the Colonel informs his &s;i&s;ter of having laid the foundation of Cantwell's overthrow. Darnley appears; after &s;ome &s;trokes of amorous dalliance, he relates what has been done in Seyward's affair, and how far the Doctor's villainy is detected. The young lady, with much good nature, recommends Seyward to her lover's patronage, and he with great gentility promi&s;es it. The Colonel returning un&s;een, hears his &s;i&s;ter &s;till trifling with her gallant, and interpo&s;es, going &s;o far as even to fix a wedding-day for her; and, at length, he &s;o far prevails, that &s;he gives her
<PB N="183" REF="189">
hand to Darnley, and taking the gallant into another chamber, the fourth act is concluded.</P>
<P>We meet the lady and her &s;wain at the beginning of the fifth act, conver&s;ing upon the bargain &s;he has provi&s;ionally made with Cantwell for his con|&s;ent, which Darnley &s;eems willing to fulfil. Sir John joins them, and after apologizing for his abrupt behaviour, enters upon the topic of his daughter's marriage; he acknowledges the Doctor has quitted his claim, yet &s;till &s;eems determined to have him for a &s;on-in-law. Charlotte, warmed with indignation, lays a heavy charge again&s;t the Doctor, and being provoked by her father's ob&s;tinate credu|lity, declares her re&s;olution to marry Darnley at all events. Charlotte's earne&s;tne&s;s, and his lady's pro|po&s;ition of giving him occular demon&s;tration, make him con&s;ent to &s;tand behind a &s;creen, while Lady Lambert gives his hypocritical favourite an audience.</P>
<P>When the fair &s;poken &s;on of impiety appears, her lady&s;hip, with powerful artifice, &s;eems apprehen&s;ive of another &s;urprize, and cautions him to fa&s;ten the doors; then enters upon the declaration of love he has made, and plainly intimates, that it was not on|ly acceptable, but very agreeable to her. Thus &s;he lures him on till he comes to the point, and goes &s;o far as to &s;ay openly, that he can lead Sir John by the no&s;e; here the enraged baronet ru&s;hes forwards, and loads him with ju&s;t accu&s;ations, which Cantwell &s;trives for &s;ome time to throw off by calm eva&s;ion; but, being pre&s;&s;ed, fires into re&s;entment, and advert|ing to the deed of &s;ettlement, de&s;ires Sir John to walk out of his hou&s;e. While matters are in this &s;tate, Maw-worm and old Lady Lambert enter; upon the baronet's telling his mother that the
<PB N="184" REF="190">
Doctor is a villain, &s;ome very ludicrous remarks drop from his di&s;ciple, who wont believe any thing to his prejudice. Charlotte, in a fright, acquaints her father that &s;he apprehends murder, as the Doctor was heard at high words with Seyward, and immediately after a pi&s;tol went off. This matter is &s;oon cleared up by Seyward; after which Cantwell is going off, but Colonel Lambert meets him with a tip&s;taff, properly attended, and delivers him into cu&s;tody. Even in this &s;ituation of conviction and dilemma, his in&s;olence continues, and he boa&s;ts of being ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e: in this, however, he is defeated, by having a deed quite the rever&s;e of what he imagines; here he is carried off, we think with too much tamene&s;s on his &s;ide: the old lady and Maw-worm go off, not convinced.</P>
<P>After the hero is thus di&s;po&s;ed of, the piece is brought to an excellent conclu&s;ion by the following &s;peech, delivered by Charlotte, when Sir John, in the heat of his vexation &s;ays, that henceforth he &s;hall hold in abhorrence every thing which bears the ap|pearance of piety:  <Q REND="inline">"Nay now, dear &s;ir, I mu&s;t take the liberty to tell you, you carry things too far, and go from one extreme to another&mdash;What? becau&s;e a worthle&s;s wretch has impo&s;ed upon you, under the fallacious &s;hew of au&s;tere grimace, will you needs have it every body is like him, confound the good with the bad, and conclude there are no truly reli|gious in the world? Leave, my dear &s;ir, &s;uch ra&s;h conclu&s;ions to fools and libertines; let us be care|ful to di&s;tingui&s;h between virtue and the appearance of it; guard, if po&s;&s;ible, again&s;t doing honour to hypocri&s;y; but, at the &s;ame time, let us allow there is no character in life greater or more valuable, than
<PB N="185" REF="191">
that of the truly devout; nor any thing more no|ble or more beautiful, than the fervour of a &s;incere piety."</Q></P>
<P>The plot of this play is regular, and &s;ufficiently intricate without being improbable or ob&s;cure; the incidents are well ranged, an agreeable &s;u&s;pence is properly kept up, and the cata&s;trophe gratifies every liberal mind; the characters, which exhibit variety within natural bounds, we &s;hall, according to the rule of this work, con&s;ider &s;eparately.</P>
<P>Sir John Lambert is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that kind of weakne&s;s which de&s;igning men work on at plea|&s;ure: enthu&s;ia&s;m flouri&s;hes, and indeed can only exi&s;t in flexible under&s;tandings; it is a weed that like thi&s;tles among corn, de&s;troys the noble&s;t har|ve&s;t of the mind. The baronet appears to be a very well-meaning man, a good hu&s;band, and a tender father; yet, under the abominable influence of a canting knave, &s;eems ready to violate every princi|ple of tho&s;e two leading characters in the &s;ocial com|pact. In repre&s;entation this baronet is neither for nor again&s;t the actor, and we pre&s;ume our&s;elves right when we think as well of Mr. PACKER, as of any body el&s;e that could be put into the part.</P>
<P>Darnley appears to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of good qualities, but has a taint of &s;u&s;picion and impatience in his temper by no means agreeable. Charlotte's method of making him feel his failing is &s;en&s;ible, and occa|&s;ions much plea&s;antry. The circum&s;tances he is placed in are not very de&s;irable to a performer, and therefore we could wi&s;h that &s;o e&s;timable an actor as Mr. REDDISH was ea&s;ed of him: that gentleman, by being a little &s;pared, would ri&s;e fa&s;ter in public e&s;timation; be&s;ides, we dont conceive Darnley to
<PB N="186" REF="192">
be in his &s;tile of acting. It is no doubt a compli|ment and advantage to an author to have as many capital performers in his drama as po&s;&s;ible, but it is rather &s;evere upon one who &s;tands in the fir&s;t light, to be either put out of or below his &s;phere.</P>
<P>Colonel Lambert is a free, &s;en&s;ible, &s;pirited gen|tleman, who has &s;o little per&s;onal concern with the piece, that he might ea&s;ily be cut out and not be much mi&s;&s;ed; however, he is not at all a di&s;agreea|ble object, and we wi&s;h he was in the hands of &s;ome per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing more vivacity than Mr. JEFFERSON.</P>
<P>Seyward is a very amiable young per&s;on, who&s;e &s;entiments we approve, and who&s;e &s;ituation we pity; the circum&s;tance of his love is at be&s;t but trifling, and vani&s;hes we know not how; it might have been omitted, and then the part he acts again&s;t Cantwell, coming from di&s;intere&s;ted hone&s;ty, would place him in a fairer degree of prai&s;e. We remember to have &s;een Mr. PALMER do this part in the original play, with much more feeling and propriety than Mr. CAUTHERLY manife&s;ts in it at pre&s;ent, not but we allow the latter to be very tolerable, as acting goes at pre&s;ent; Mr. ROSS was much the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Doctor Cantwell, much more emphatically called Wolf, by CIBBER, is a very high fini&s;hed piece of villainy; proud, avaricious, &s;en&s;ual, ungrateful and hypocritical; one who &s;acrifices con&s;cience, hone&s;ty and religion, to the ba&s;e&s;t, underhand purpo&s;es; a mon&s;ter in nature, and a di&s;grace to the human race. We remember to have heard a very &s;en&s;ible remark from a liberal, moral judge of mankind, that chap|lains in general, of every religion, have oftner pro|moted dome&s;tic confu&s;ion than piety; and we can|not help highly approving the expre&s;&s;ion of a Ro|man
<PB N="187" REF="193">
Catholic nobleman, who, during the rebellion of forty-five, &s;hewed him&s;elf zealous in the Pro|te&s;tant cau&s;e; upon being a&s;ked his rea&s;on, he &s;aid he liked the pre&s;ent form of government, and wi&s;hed Popery to be kept out of the kingdom; for if that prevailed, his chaplains, who now would bear a me&s;&s;age for him, would turn the tables, and make him their me&s;&s;age carrier. Cantwell is placed in very judicious points of view, to &s;hew the danger of &s;uch &s;anctified vermin, who creep, &s;nake-like, into your bo&s;om, to &s;ting you mortally. His vil|lainy is revealed by ju&s;t degrees, and his fate is well &s;uited to his de&s;erts.</P>
<P>There is more difficulty in doing this character ju&s;tice than is commonly imagined, much and &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion of countenance is requi&s;ite, as well as &s;mooth and nervous utterance. We have &s;een the Doctor per&s;onated with great ability and much ap|plau&s;e, by both Mr. THE. CIBBER, and Mr. SPARKS; however, they were both too mechanical, wanting that e&s;&s;ential ea&s;e and plau&s;ibility which makes us give Mr. KING the preference.</P>
<P>Maw-worm we owe to the alterer of this piece, and are highly obliged to him for &s;o rich an im|provement of the laureat's production. We are equally obliged to Mr. WESTON for his inimitable &s;upport of it: Mr. MOODY once exhibited this ri&s;i|ble piece of religious in&s;anity, but we hope never will again; and Mr. WALDRON was &s;o much out of his depth, when the managers <HI>popped</HI> him, like Mr. FOOTE's Lindamira on for it, that we are a|mazed the young man was not overwhelmed by the tide of popular di&s;plea&s;ure; if he is held forth as the turtle of low comedy, we beg leave to borrow an
<PB N="188" REF="194">
idea from Mr. COLMAN, and a&s;&s;ert, he has not one bit of the green fat about him.</P>
<P>We hear Mr. WESTON is gone to Scotland; is it not amazing and vexatious to all lovers of the dra|ma, that when there is &s;uch a lamentable, unpa|ralelled lack of merit, at both hou&s;es, two &s;uch in|trin&s;ic performers as Me&s;&s;rs. WOODWARD and WES|TON, &s;hould be driven to a northern migration. Is this gratitude to the public? oh &s;hame!</P>
<P>Old Lady Lambert is al&s;o an additional cha|racter, of no great con&s;equence, yet well conceived; as by her we perceive that per&s;ons of rank and edu|cation are liable to catch the infection of enthu&s;ia&s;m, as well as tho&s;e of the lower and more uncultivated cla&s;s. Her ideas of religious purity are diverting, and we have no objection to Mrs. BRADSHAW's me|thod of delivering them; &s;he maintains the &s;ancti|fied formality in a very &s;uitable manner.</P>
<P>Her daughter-in-law is a very good, conformable young wife, to an odd kind of an elderly hu&s;band; &s;he &s;eems de&s;irous to promote his happine&s;s and the welfare of his family, but has nothing to &s;ay worth notice, and at be&s;t can only be con&s;idered as an a|greeable daudle: Mrs. W. BARRY de&s;erves a better part, and does what &s;he can with this.</P>
<P>Charlotte is undoubtedly the be&s;t drawn coquette, and the mo&s;t defen&s;ible one on the &s;tage; &s;he likes adulation, yet has &s;incerity enough to own it; &s;he loves a man, yet has di&s;cernment to &s;ee his particu|lar failing, and re&s;olution to laugh him plea&s;antly out of it; &s;he is ornamented with genero&s;ity, &s;prightline&s;s and wit, nor is her vanity any way of|fen&s;ive. Mrs. WOFFINGTON, in the NON JUROR, obtained &s;ingular applau&s;e, not without great merit;
<PB N="189" REF="195">
however, there was &s;uch an uncharacteri&s;tic affecta|tion about her, that &s;ome degree of di&s;gu&s;t mu&s;t at|tend it; and &s;he marked tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which had any reli&s;h of licentiou&s;ne&s;s very offen&s;ively. Mrs. PRITCHARD had much more ea&s;e, and equal &s;pirit of expre&s;&s;ion; but was, from corpulence, &s;o very ab&s;urd an appearance, that however our ears might be plea&s;ed, our eyes were offended. Mrs. ABING|TON being a very agreeable mixture of the&s;e ladies much freer than the former, and more delicate than the latter, fills our idea of Charlotte to every degree of &s;atisfaction. Mr. BICKERSTAFF, in his preface, has paid this accompli&s;hed actre&s;s a very genteel and ju&s;t compliment.</P>
<P>As we have ob&s;erved at the beginning of our cri|tici&s;ms on this piece, the NON JUROR was growing ob&s;olete, it was therefore highly judicious to give the &s;atire a new and more intelligible form: CIB|BER's dialogue, though not remarkably correct, is natural, ea&s;y, and &s;pirited; the additions in no &s;hape di&s;grace him, and there are &s;ome omi&s;&s;ions which do him credit. Upon the whole, we heartily wi&s;h the HYPOCRITE encouragement on the &s;tage, and attention in the clo&s;et.</P>

<PB N="190" REF="196">
<HEAD>THEODOSIUS. A TRAGEDY: By LEE.</HEAD>
<P>THE tragedy of THEODOSIUS opens with all the pomp of religious pageantry; a decorated al|tar, the figure of Con&s;tantine kneeling to an air &s;u&s;|pended cro&s;s, prie&s;ts, chori&s;ters and mu&s;ic: after a preparatory hymn and chorus, Atticus, the high prie&s;t, enters into conference with Leontine, a phi|lo&s;opher. By what pa&s;&s;es between them, we find that Theodo&s;ius, from a fixed melancholly on his mind, has determined to lay a&s;ide the reins of go|vernment for holy retirement: Leontine, who had been tutor to him and a Per&s;ian prince, called Va|ranes, delineates the&s;e royal characters, and &s;ignifies, that the latter, attended by his daughter, is coming on a vi&s;it to the former.</P>
<P>Varanes approaching with Athenais they retire; the &s;hort &s;cene which occurs between the&s;e lovers, means no more than to declare his warmth of pa&s;|&s;ion and her diffidence, ari&s;ing from di&s;parity of rank between the heir of empire and a poor philo|&s;opher's daughter. The prince's declarations ma|nife&s;t rather an impetuous than a prudent pa&s;&s;ion. The approach of Theodo&s;ius being announced by &s;ound of in&s;truments they retire, and make way for the Emperor, attended by his two &s;i&s;ters, Marina and Flavilla, who have determined to take the veil.</P>
<P>Previous to his &s;piritual admi&s;&s;ion, the Imperial devotee confe&s;&s;es to Atticus, in a very plea&s;ing de|&s;criptive
<PB N="191" REF="197">
narration, that love, to an incurable degree, is the cau&s;e of that anxiety which exiles him from public life. Leontine pronounces the approach of Varanes, who immediately enters, warmed with the glow of early and &s;incere friend&s;hip; their advert|ing to the &s;ports of former days, the theatre and the field, is very natural for juvenile, as well as aged minds; what Varanes &s;ays of hunting, is poetically imagined and well expre&s;&s;ed: the prince u&s;es his endeavours to per&s;uade Theodo&s;ius from his pur|po&s;e; however, &s;eems &s;truck with the awful cere|mony of admitting nuns, and by the conclu&s;ive &s;peech of the fir&s;t act, &s;hews as if he was half won over to retirement; the &s;entiments he utters, and his remark upon the weight that royalty lays on mental freedom, are pretty, but horridly di&s;graced by rhime.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, Pulcheria, Theodo&s;ius's &s;i&s;ter, who is inve&s;ted with imperial authority, hears the cla&s;h of &s;words, and &s;oon after is acco&s;ted by Marcian, a Roman general, who apo|logizes for quarrelling in the palace, by reciting the particulars of his provocation; in doing of which he throws out many low and indecent ob&s;ervations; the&s;e, we pre&s;ume, the author meant as proofs of martial bluntne&s;s, but are in reality ab&s;olute breaches of decorum, cen&s;urable to the la&s;t degree, and the more &s;o as being quite unnece&s;&s;ary; his reflections upon court effeminacy are, no doubt, very natural effu&s;ions of an hone&s;t mind, irritated by the buzzing, gaudy in&s;ects of court &s;un-&s;hine, and this part of the &s;cene we highly approve.</P>
<P>Openne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion becomes an hone&s;t and brave character, but to bully a lady of exalted &s;ta|tion,
<PB N="192" REF="198">
as this militarian does, is beyond all bearing, and we think &s;he &s;u&s;tains his abu&s;e too long; how|ever, at length, becoming &s;pirit breaks forth, and &s;he reproves him in &s;evere terms, at the &s;ame time bani&s;hing him after three days; there is &s;omething whim&s;ical enough in Pulcheria's intimation a&s;ide, that he is once to lord it over her. Lucius, upon &s;eeing his friend, the general, droop, at receiving &s;o har&s;h and &s;udden a &s;entence, propo&s;es to a&s;&s;ert his cau&s;e by force, which Marcian declines, accepting exile and retirement in the following well fancied, well expre&s;&s;ed lines.</P>
<Q><L>We'll fly to &s;ome far di&s;tant lonely village,</L>

<P>Athenais and Leontine pre&s;ent them&s;elves, the latter ob&s;erving, that they have paid the compli|ment Varanes de&s;ired, of attending him to Theodo|&s;ius's court, propo&s;es returning to Athens; this affects the love-&s;tricken maid, who confe&s;&s;es her un|ea&s;ine&s;s, and draws from Leontine a doubt of the prince's &s;incerity, which Athenais cannot admit; however, upon her father's &s;tarting the idea of a di&s;honourable connection, with the ju&s;t feelings of a cha&s;te re&s;erve, &s;he declares that no con&s;ideration, however intere&s;ting, not a parent's life in danger, &s;hall impair her virtue; this &s;atisfies the old man, who, upon &s;eeing the prince approach, retires.</P>
<P>By what Varanes &s;ays to his friend Aranthes at entrance, it appears, that the latter has been advi&s;ing him again&s;t a matrimonial connection, as di&s;grace|ful,
<PB N="193" REF="199">
which he &s;eems to admit in very ungenerous terms; yet, upon &s;eeing Athenais, he renews his vows with great fervour, and in a very bomba&s;tic flow of expre&s;&s;ion declares, that he prefers her to all the Per&s;ian greatne&s;s. Upon mention of his fa|ther's di&s;plea&s;ure if he &s;hould know of his &s;on's at|tachment to &s;o inadequate a character, he utters the following beautiful effu&s;ion of a fond mind.</P>
<Q><L>No more of this, no more, for I di&s;dain</L>
<L>All pomp when thou art by: far be the noi&s;e</L>
<L>Of kings and courts from us; who&s;e gentle &s;ouls</L>
<L>Our kinder &s;tars have &s;teer'd another cour&s;e;</L>
<L>Free as the fore&s;t birds we'll pair together,</L>
<L>Without remembring who our father's were;</L>
<L>Fly to the arbours, grots, and flow'ry meads,</L>
<L>And in &s;oft murmurs interchange our &s;ouls;</L>
<L>Together drink the chry&s;tal of the &s;tream,</L>
<L>Or ta&s;te the yellow fruit which autumn yields;</L>
<L>And when the golden evening calls us home,</L>
<L>Wing to our downy ne&s;t and &s;leep till morn.</L></Q>
<P>When Athenais mentions a nece&s;&s;ity of parting, Varanes takes alarm, which cau&s;es her to refer him to Leontine for explanation; the philo&s;opher inge|nuou&s;ly que&s;tions the real meaning of his pa&s;&s;ion, which throws the prince into confu&s;ion; and being urged to the critical point of marriage, his illiberal pride, getting the better of genero&s;ity and truth, occa&s;ions him to treat the woman of his heart, and his venerable good old tutor, in a mo&s;t brutal, con|temptuous manner; Leontine warms into a noble re&s;entment, which forces the hot-brained Per&s;ian off in a very di&s;graceful manner.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="200">Every heart, &s;u&s;ceptible of tender feelings, mu&s;t here &s;ympathize in that painful concern which over|whelms the injured father and &s;lighted maid; the latter of whom acknowledges at large her ardent affection, but nobly re&s;olves to &s;acrifice it at the &s;hrine of ju&s;t re&s;entment, and gives her approving &s;ire the mo&s;t &s;olemn, comfortable a&s;&s;urance, of in|violable virtue; this &s;cene takes &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the tender pa&s;&s;ions, but concludes with &s;ome very enervate, pitiful rhimes.</P>
<P>Varanes, totally repenting his treatment of Athe|nais, meets Aranthes at the beginning of the third act, and communicates his readine&s;s to make her any reparation: being informed that &s;he and her father have left the court, without any trace by which they might be followed, with the utmo&s;t vio|lence of anxiety, the hair-brained lover determines upon a per&s;onal pur&s;uit, ordering his chariots to meet him in the Hippodrome. In the next &s;cene we are &s;urprized with the conver&s;ion of Athenais to Chri&s;tianity, for which we have been no way pre|pared; nor do we know whether it is Leontine's choice that his daughter &s;hould go one road into futurity, while he him&s;elf pur&s;ues another. The matter is very &s;oon brought about, and is not &s;uffi|ciently probable; however, we find it &s;o, and that Pulcheria has wrought the change, for which her pro&s;elyte returns thanks in grateful terms: the im|perial prince&s;s vows &s;trict friend&s;hip, and propo&s;es a mutual participation of joys and griefs. Touch|ing upon the ma&s;ter-&s;tring of her heart, Athenais, who, but a few lines &s;ince &s;ays, that conver&s;ion has ea&s;ed her of the <HI>lumber of pa&s;&s;ion</HI>&mdash;a kind of me|thodi&s;tical
<PB N="195" REF="201">
figure&mdash;here gives a loo&s;e to grief, and vents bitter reproaches again&s;t the fallacy of man.</P>
<P>Theodo&s;ius coming in, his &s;i&s;ter pre&s;ents her fair convert, when lo! it appears, that &s;he is the identi|cal unknown beauty who had in&s;pired him with love, and for who&s;e &s;ake he meant to leave the world. This incident tells well in action; his immediate proffer of marriage is violently &s;udden, yet no har&s;h violation of nature. Leontine's approbation of the honourable choice is &s;uitable, and the author has furni&s;hed Athenais with a proper degree of diffident &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in her reply; the new appointed Em|pre&s;s, Pulcheria, &amp;c. being retired, Varanes, who comes to take his leave of Theodo&s;ius, is acquainted with the unexpected change in favour of that mo|narch's happine&s;s; the Per&s;ian prince, though deep|ly wounded in mind him&s;elf, congratulates his friend's joy, and laments that his own painful &s;itua|tion wont let him &s;tay to &s;hare it.</P>
<P>This naturally damps Theodo&s;ius's &s;atisfaction; however, he reque&s;ts Varanes to &s;ee his bride before he goes, which the latter &s;eems willing to decline. There is &s;omething odd in the Emperor's behaviour, not to a&s;k the cau&s;e of his friend's melancholly and &s;udden departure; the plot has here intruded much upon friend&s;hip; Athenais is brought on, and pre|&s;ented by her imperial lover to the Per&s;ian, who&s;e a&s;toni&s;hment and confu&s;ion may be much more ea&s;i|ly imagined than expre&s;&s;ed. To increa&s;e the &s;well and agitation of his heart, &s;he treats him as the pro|vocation he gave her merited, and leaves him to vent his pa&s;&s;ion with Theodo&s;ius. What pa&s;&s;es be|tween the&s;e royal per&s;onages is again very odd, for though the half-headed Emperor &s;ees his friend
<PB N="196" REF="202">
eaten up with pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;uffers him&s;elf to be cate|chized for taking the woman he likes, yet he never enquires into the rea&s;on of all this; indeed, when Varanes clears up the matter, by avowing his pa&s;|&s;ion, he &s;hews &s;ome generous &s;en&s;ibility, by offering to &s;ubmit his claim to the lady's choice. This cau&s;es Varanes to whimper like a whipped &s;chool-boy; and Theodo&s;ius, piou&s;ly leaving the i&s;&s;ue to heaven, goes to prepare Athenais for an interview with his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed rival. Aranthes, by offering to comfort his ma&s;ter, inflames his rage more, and is charged with being the author of his misfortune; notwith&s;tanding the prince is half mad, our author has put into his mouth a poetical de&s;cription of the tranquility of rural ob&s;curity; yet this we could have borne tolerably well, as the thought is pretty, and the lines flowing, had not jingle been intro|duced.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act, we meet Marcian lamenting his fallen &s;tate; he is &s;oon join|ed by that other unentertaining &s;uperfluity, Pul|cheria, who, as it would &s;eem, has &s;neaked after him. The la&s;t time they parted &s;he pronounced his ba|ni&s;hment, yet now &s;he &s;o far forgets her&s;elf, as to tru&s;t him with a very &s;ignal in&s;tance of her imperial brother's folly; andd then as &s;trangely di&s;covers, without any hint to &s;tir recollection, that &s;he has been talking with a pro&s;cribed traitor. This draws on three or four lines of fre&s;h reproach, then &s;he &s;oftens, taking a very dubious leave.</P>
<P>When Lucius concludes &s;he is in love with the general, and tells him &s;o, Marcian very ju&s;tly re|plies, that they neither of them know any thing of her, and that it is out of the power of human nature
<PB N="197" REF="203">
to &s;can her. We mo&s;t heartily concur in the &s;ol|dier's opinion, for, as the author has drawn her, &s;he is equally unintelligible and in&s;ignificant: an un|principled excre&s;cence of a poetical brain.</P>
<P>The token of Theodo&s;ius's weakne&s;s, which &s;he has put into Marcian's hand, he determines to make u&s;e of, for rou&s;ing the Emperor from his lethargic effeminacy. This the author has made him put in practice, but the &s;cene is generally omitted, and we think blameably; for though it wants much foft|ning on Marcian's &s;ide, yet a &s;ubject forcing bold, hone&s;t truths, into a weak monarch's ear, is a very plea&s;ing and in&s;tructive picture for a Briti&s;h &s;tage; though perhaps &s;uch a one, in a new piece, might not now be licenced; po&s;&s;ibly it is from a &s;imilar principle omitted by courtly managers. We re|member the &s;cene once done in Dublin, with very plea&s;ing and proper effect.</P>
<P>The &s;hort &s;cene between Theodo&s;ius and Athe|nais, preparatory to &s;eeing Varanes, &s;hews the Em|peror to be a mo&s;t conde&s;cending rival; and the la|dy ob&s;erves, with great good &s;en&s;e, that it is a &s;evere and dangerous trial, to throw her in the way of one who had once in&s;pired her with &s;o tender a pa&s;&s;ion; he notwith&s;tanding, leaves her to the violent &s;truggle of love and glory. No &s;ooner is he gone off, than Varanes appears, a picture of de&s;pair; &s;he is &s;truck with the &s;ettled melancholly that clouds him, yet re|&s;olves to with&s;tand the &s;ofter feelings: her taunts are remarkably &s;evere, particularly where &s;he mentions hearing him in obedience to the Emperor's com|mand. In &s;hort, &s;he reduces the prince to &s;uch an exqui&s;ite degree of pain, that though &s;ome of his conduct merits contempt, we are obliged to pity
<PB N="198" REF="204">
him. Where he mentions his death, and begs that compa&s;&s;ion which he cannot obtain in life, the &s;cene grows truly pathetic, and the audience mu&s;t melt with Athenais; who, &s;hocked at the &s;ound of an everla&s;ting farewell from the idol of her heart, calls him back, and candidly, with warmth, expre&s;&s;es her love, yet leaves him with the idea, that their incli|nations cannot be fulfilled. What the rea&s;on of this in&s;uperable perplexity is, we dont &s;ee; having for|given the in&s;ult &s;he received, and Theodo&s;ius be|ing di&s;po&s;ed to confirm her choice, what happens appears to be only the author's ob&s;tinate pur&s;uit of a tragical cata&s;trophe. What Varanes &s;ays after &s;he is gone, appears to us very &s;trained and bom|ba&s;tical: comparing him&s;elf to a per&s;on buried a|live, is &s;training idea horridly: it is worthy of re|mark, that in this &s;cene, Varanes &s;wears by, or ap|peals to the gods, no le&s;s than &s;ix times; indeed, through the whole piece, Marcian and he are bring|ing in the deities upon every occa&s;ion; in&s;omuch, that allowing the difference of plurality, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed they had been educated among the Eng|li&s;h foot-guards, where &s;wearing is a capital accom|pli&s;hment, and con&s;tant practice.</P>
<P>Athenais, ornamented with imperial robes for the nuptials, begins the fifth act, with her attendant Delia. She very ju&s;tly complains of being hurried to the Temple at the midnight hour, but is told that the de&s;ign is to keep her marriage as long as po&s;|&s;ible from the knowledge of Varanes, in compa&s;&s;ion to his pains; her confidante di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;he deter|mines upon taking poi&s;on, and empties the deadly cup. Pulcheria, at entrance, takes notice of the Empre&s;s's di&s;tre&s;sful and pallid looks: doubting the
<PB N="199" REF="205">
effect of what &s;he has done in futurity, Athenais a&s;ks what puni&s;hment awaits &s;uicide, which is a very natural que&s;tion, as &s;he has been &s;o lately made a Chri&s;tian, and heathen &s;ects hold it a meritorious action to &s;eek refuge in voluntary death, rather than labour under exce&s;s of pain or di&s;grace. Leontine coming to conduct his daughter to the Temple, ob|&s;erves and reproves her melancholly, charging her to think no more of Varanes, who has u&s;ed her ill; the unforgiving rigidity of unfeeling age is here well contra&s;ted to the relenting &s;oftne&s;s of a female heart, impre&s;&s;ed with a tender regard; the unhappy bride &s;uffers her&s;elf to be led like a tame victim, yet pathetically declares Varanes can never be era&s;ed or bani&s;hed from her mind.</P>
<P>The Per&s;ian prince, wholly a prey to de&s;pair, ap|pears next, in &s;oliloquy. Our author has drawn toge|ther, and furni&s;hed him with various &s;triking images, well adapted to the gloom of melancholly; but what in the name of nature and common &s;en&s;e, could make him run it into rhime: we had &s;ome idea of relieving this &s;peech from &s;uch &s;hameful fetters, in the &s;ame manner we did that of the Fryar in Ro|meo and Juliet, but as the play wants alteration in many other re&s;pects, we have declined it.</P>
<P>Upon the entrance of Aranthes, who has been &s;ent by the prince to Athenais's apartment, he ac|quaints his ma&s;ter that &s;he is gone to be married; this determines Varanes on &s;peedily putting a pe|riod to his intolerable life, and he claims holding the &s;word again&s;t his brea&s;t, as an action of friend|&s;hip, from Aranthes; who propo&s;es to attend his ma&s;ter in death, but is charged to &s;urvive, and bear his bleeding cor&s;e immediately to the Temple.
<PB N="200" REF="206">
Things &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, our broken-hearted hero puts his fatal re&s;olution in practice, and breaths his la&s;t in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable couplet, rather laughable than pa|thetic.</P>
<P>We are once again conducted to the Temple, where, after a nuptial benediction is given, Aranthes enters with the body of his decea&s;ed lord; and in two &s;peeches, intere&s;tingly de&s;criptive, relates the manner of his death. Athenais, overwhelmed with the circum&s;tance, quits the living bridegroom for the dead lover; embraces his body, declares, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of her hu&s;band, father, &amp;c. that tho' &s;he con&s;ented to marriage, her heart was always with Varanes; wherefore, &s;he took a poi&s;onous draught, which &s;oon takes effect, and &s;ends her af|ter the dear object of her fir&s;t inclination. Theo|do&s;ius, &s;truck with this unexpected incident, renews his former intention of laying down the reins of go|vernment, and gives the empire to Pulcheria and Marcian, who have made up matters very &s;trange|ly; thus the piece hurries to a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The tragedy of THEODOSIUS is regular in its plot, and has many &s;cenes of peculiar tenderne&s;s; yet is &s;adly incumbered by tho&s;e di&s;agreeable non-e&s;&s;entials, Marcian and Pulcheria, who have almo&s;t as little bu&s;ine&s;s in that piece, as they would have in Julius Cae&s;ar. The play might ea&s;ily be altered &s;o as to leave them entirely out, by which means the other characters would nece&s;&s;arily be enriched, and the main action more properly attended to: the ver&s;ification is flowing, and many of the &s;entiments brilliant, yet bomba&s;t frequently &s;oars to a di&s;a|greeable, unintelligible height; the author has
<PB N="201" REF="207">
&s;hewn warmth of genius, but coldne&s;s and inactivity of judgment.</P>
<P>Theodo&s;ius&mdash;&s;ure there never was &s;uch an in&s;ipid mor&s;el of royalty, is &s;carce a character in any &s;hape; he has nothing to mark him but a kind of boyi&s;h, amorous weakne&s;s. After his fir&s;t &s;cene, he has not a line to utter that is worth an actor's &s;peaking, or a &s;pectator's hearing: it is hardly rea&s;onable, though he gives name to the piece, to mention the perform|ance of &s;uch an un&s;ea&s;oned incumbrance upon action; if we mi&s;take not, Mr. SMITH made his fir&s;t attempt in this unfavourable part, which he rendered in &s;ome mea&s;ure bearable, and has conti|nued to bear it up ever &s;ince till la&s;t &s;ea&s;on. Mr. DIGGES has been pu&s;hed on for it, but was much too manly in his per&s;on, and too declamatory in his expre&s;&s;ion; the lover, at lea&s;t of this cla&s;s, &s;its un|ea&s;y upon him. Mr. REDDISH! in the name of equity, if any &s;uch principle dwells within a theatre, why &s;hould &s;uch &s;uperior abilities be crammed into &s;o di&s;agreeable an undertaking? e&s;pecially when that <HI>capital</HI> actor, Mr. CAUTHERLY, might much more properly drudge through it, than Hamlet, Romeo, and a dreadful &amp;c. which with mo&s;t cruel kindne&s;s are impo&s;ed upon him.</P>
<P>Marcian, the tragical blunderbu&s;s, who &s;eems to have no idea of any difference between freedom and rudene&s;s of &s;peech, utters &s;everal &s;entiments which, well expre&s;&s;ed, cannot fail of applau&s;e, and Mr. SPARKS u&s;ed to give us &s;ingular plea&s;ure in tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages: Mr. CLARKE is by no means di&s;plea&s;ing, but Mr. AICKIN, mounted on LEE's fiery, hard|mouthed PEGASUS, &s;its in a very tickli&s;h, tottering &s;ituation. Mr. MOSSOP did it one &s;ea&s;on in Dub|lin,
<PB N="202" REF="208">
and thinking it unworthy his powers, acquired, through negligence, an ea&s;e which he wanted in more important characters; &s;o became, by acci|dent, much the mo&s;t agreeable performer we ever &s;aw in this part.</P>
<P>Leontine is a character of worth; he may be ren|dered e&s;timable without any capital requi&s;ites; his &s;olicitude for Athenais's virtue, and contempt of ag|grandi&s;ement upon unworthy terms, &s;peak him e|qually a tender father and a good man; he mu&s;t in|tere&s;t an audience, e&s;pecially where he calls his pu|pil to an explanation. Mr. RIDOUT per&s;onated this amiable philo&s;opher with ability: Mr. GIBSON has had the misfortune to follow him in the part, but never can &s;ucceed to his merit; having either no feeling at all, or &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;tful utterance of it, as is wor&s;e than none: Mr. HULL &s;hould certain|ly do it at Covent Garden.</P>
<P>Aranthes has but two &s;peeches of any regard, they indeed &s;hould be taken care of; wherefore, we cannot &s;ufficiently expre&s;s our &s;urprize to think any manager &s;hould &s;o far mi&s;take his place and judg|ment, as to &s;uffer the marring of them by that di&s;|tingui&s;hed mutilator of &s;en&s;e, language and charact|er, Mr. DAVIS: on the other hand, we cannot re|concile giving this attendant at Drury Lane, to Mr. PALMER, who frequently &s;tands in a fir&s;t light; it is making both head and tail of a man. Certainly, among&s;t the number of young mutes, who &s;erve on|ly to prop up the &s;ide wings, and bow to every ba&s;haw of three tails, &s;ome one might be found to do &s;uch a part as this with tolerable decency.</P>
<P>Varanes, who was mo&s;t the object of our au|thor's attention, is an odd medley of love and pride;
<PB N="203" REF="209">
now he will, then will not; profu&s;e in profe&s;&s;ions, irre&s;olute in practice; tender, impatient; in &s;hort, a romantic madman; yet, notwith&s;tanding incon&s;i&s;t|encies of a glaring nature, he is as a dramatic per&s;onage, highly intere&s;ting. We have under|gone the torture of hearing him preached by Mr. SHERIDAN, who&s;e &s;tage-love was the mo&s;t grating that ever wounded a tender ear; yet we cannot ju&s;tly avoid allowing him a very character|i&s;tical de&s;pondance of features in the la&s;t &s;cene of the fourth act, and con&s;iderable merit in the mid|night &s;oliloquy. Mr. ROSS is very bearable, but wants much of that fire nece&s;&s;ary to keep pace with his author: when Mr. SMITH took leave of the Emperor, and formed an alliance with the Per&s;ian prince, he made a mo&s;t lamentable mi&s;take; and we wi&s;h, for old acquaintance &s;ake, he may return to his original, di&s;agreeable as it is, rather than &s;hew him&s;elf to more con&s;picuous di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY mu&s;t in imagination to tho&s;e who are at all acquainted with his performance, fill up every idea of excellence in this character; his love was enchanting, his rage alarming, his grief melt|ing; even now, though overtaken by time, and im|paired in his con&s;titution, he has not the &s;hadow of a competitor. The rheumatic &s;tiffne&s;s of his joints has been indu&s;triou&s;ly trumpeted forth, and every mean art made u&s;e of to lower him in public opinion: yet true it is, that if he hobbled upon &s;tilts, he would be better than any per&s;ons in his &s;tile upon their be&s;t legs. A gentleman of acknowledged judgment lately made the following ju&s;t and &s;triking &s;imili|tude, that Mr. BARRY was like the time-worn ruins of Palmira and Balbec; which, even in a fallen
<PB N="204" REF="210">
&s;tate, &s;hew more dignity and real beauty, than the compleat productions of modern architecture. We heartily lament that this gentleman's ca&s;t is &s;o in|con&s;i&s;tent with his years, and wi&s;h his prudence had laid up an independancy, that he might have retired ere envy and theatrical policy had &s;apped the foun|dation of his well-earned fame.</P>
<P>Pulcheria, as a character, we have already given our opinion of; what &s;he &s;ays is full as in&s;ignificant as what &s;he does; and Mrs. VINCENT, whom no length of years can make old, if &s;he had never been tru&s;ted with any &s;uperior undertaking in tragedy, might here have been bearable enough: but what dull head, or hard heart, could have put the agreea|ble Mrs. W. BARRY, of Drury Lane, upon &s;o irk&s;ome an undertaking&mdash; Come forth Mrs. HOPKINS, and &s;eize this Roman prince&s;s, more con&s;onant to thy abilities, than the young and beauteous Zara, and as &s;uitable to thy delicate figure.</P>
<P>Athenais is much the mo&s;t e&s;timable character in this piece; for, laying a&s;ide the weakne&s;s of her &s;ex, and re&s;i&s;ting the temptation of a darling object, &s;he maintains that exalted virtue practically, which her father only admires and recommends in &s;peculation; however, tho' we approve her general conduct, yet &s;he manife&s;ts a &s;trong taint of romantic ideas: her &s;elf-denial is carried to an extreme. As to the ter|mination of her own life, we have already exculpated that, by remarking, that &s;he had not been informed how abominable an action &s;elf-murder is deemed in the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>The part of Athenais, though well delivered from the author's pen, has none of tho&s;e ma&s;terly &s;trokes of action, which gave Mrs. CIBBER an opportunity
<PB N="205" REF="211">
of di&s;playing her exqui&s;ite abilities; wherefore, we always thought that lady rather below her&s;elf in the fair Athenian, and allowed Mrs. BELLAMY to come nearer an equality in this, than any other character; they both were &s;ingularly plea&s;ing, but we mu&s;t pre|fer Mrs. BARRY to either, as having equal force with more nature.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s MILLER has certainly given Mr. COL|MAN &s;ome bitter provocation, that he pu&s;hes her on for this and &s;everal other characters equally unfit; indeed, &s;he did it for her benefit, which is a &s;ea&s;on when many performers, to indulge vanity, kindly treat their friends with the barbarous and dreadful, though not bloody murder of a principle character; this is like a&s;king acquaintances to dinner, and giv|ing a thin brea&s;t of mutton in&s;tead of a good &s;irloin of beef, which is equally ready.</P>
<P>This play has no moral, there is no vice to merit puni&s;hment, and what virtue there is falls a &s;acrifice to ill conducted pa&s;&s;ions: we are apt to think its tendency prejudicial to young minds, as it furni&s;hes very extravagant notions of love; and therefore, though it always plea&s;es in repre&s;entation, cannot cordially recommend it.</P>

<P>IN the fir&s;t &s;cene we meet young Belmont ral|lying Colonel Raymond, for making love in a &s;tile of gravity to his &s;i&s;ter, of who&s;e volatile and coquetti&s;h di&s;po&s;ition he draws a very plea|&s;ant picture, and al&s;o, by way of contra&s;t, ludi|crou&s;ly paints the Colonel to him&s;elf; after this, he enters upon an account of women, which we think extremely injurious, to the &s;en&s;ible part of the &s;ex at lea&s;t, and &s;hews his notions to be un|natural; to &s;uppo&s;e that good under&s;tanding will make any female more ready to encourage a fool, is &s;trange doctrine; pride may work &s;uch an ef|fect, but &s;ound &s;en&s;e cannot: freedom, among friends, is the life of &s;ocial enjoyment, but, we think young Belmont places the Colonel in too &s;evere and ridiculous a light; it &s;eems as if the au|thor had &s;acrificed every other con&s;ideration to that of enriching his favourite character. When Fide|lia comes to be mentioned, Belmont goes on in the &s;ame rhap&s;odical &s;tile concerning her, that he has made u&s;e of concerning his &s;i&s;ter, re&s;pecting the uncertainty of her birth; Belmont &s;peaks as a man of gallantry with very vague, undetermined principles; upon the Colonel's enquiry, whether Ro&s;etta knows any thing of Fidelia's real &s;tory, Belmont declares &s;he does not, but believes her to be the &s;i&s;ter of a fellow collegian of his, and in
<PB N="207" REF="213">
that light recommends her as a wife to him; be|ing a&s;ked his father's di&s;po&s;ition towards the young lady, he &s;ays, there is nothing wanting of recom|mendation to the old gentleman but &s;ome cer|tainty of a fortune; here he takes a mo&s;t repre|hen&s;ible method of removing a kind of dilemma he is in, and meanly &s;ays, as he has brought her into the family by one mi&s;repre&s;entation, he'll re|move her by another; and what is that? for&s;ooth, by &s;candalizing her virtue. Belmont favours ac|tion in this &s;cene, but he is no more nor le&s;s than a de&s;picable reptile, furni&s;hed with more words than meaning, more humour than &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding conver&s;ation between Ro&s;etta and Fidelia, we find that the former rattles away in the &s;ame &s;tile and &s;entiment, concerning men, and the treatment of them in love affairs, that her brother, in the preceeding &s;cene, u&s;ed re&s;pecting her; Fidelia charges her with being in love with Colonel Raymond, though &s;he makes him wear &s;uch painful chains. The gay coquette &s;ports with this circum&s;tance a little, yet acknowledges he is not indifferent, and a&s;&s;igns a very generous motive for keeping him off at pre&s;ent; having held his &s;olicitations at a di&s;tance, while his circum|&s;tances wore an unfavourable a&s;pect, &s;he ju&s;tly thinks &s;urrendering, when fortune &s;miles upon her lover, would &s;eem mercenary.</P>
<P>By what &s;he drops, we perceive, that Sir Charles, the Colonel's father, was attainted, as having join|ed the rebellion, but lately pardoned by royal clemency; Ro&s;etta cautions Fidelia again&s;t the wildne&s;s of her brother, which draws from the lat|ter a declaration, that let the danger be what it may,
<PB N="208" REF="214">
he is the man of her choice; here Ro&s;etta archly advi&s;es her friend to marry Sir Charles, who, it appears, has &s;hewn a particular attachment for her; this, however, Fidelia thinks proceeds merely from his humanity, and is laughed at by the coquette for her grave ideas.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as &s;he is uttering the&s;e words,  <Q REND="inline">"What a &s;weet mama &s;hall I have when I marry the Colonel,"</Q> young Belmont and that gentleman enter; the for|mer repeats his &s;i&s;ter's words, which the Colonel calls lucky ones. She aims at giving them a dif|ferent turn; but Fidelia counteracts the de&s;ign, and confirms them, by repeating what &s;he has &s;aid con|cerning Sir Charles; and having her for a mama, &amp;c. thus the grave young lady indulges her mirth, while her gay companion is con&s;iderably puzzled how to turn the tables. Belmont keeps up the fret, and even the Colonel &s;eems to enjoy it; at length, a &s;ervant brings a letter which relieves her; it ap|pears to come from one Mr. Faddle, whom &s;he &s;peaks of with rapture; the Colonel &s;eems much &s;truck, and &s;hewing his unea&s;ine&s;s, gives her an op|portunity of triumphing in turn, which &s;he does by reading the coxcomb's frothy epi&s;tle, and a&s;k|ing her lover's opinion of it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act concludes with a &s;oliloquy of very boyi&s;h import, and the couplet is remarkably feeble; Sir Roger Belmont and Sir Charlos Raymond begin the &s;econd act; complaints are uttered again&s;t his &s;on's conduct by the former, which the latter en|deavours to mitigate; it appears, that Sir Roger's unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es from being at the expence of keep|ing Fidelia, without knowing whether &s;he has any fortune to repay, in ca&s;e of marriage with his
<PB N="209" REF="215">
&s;on; Sir Charles hints that a &s;erious connection is not much to be dreaded, and both the old gentle|men appear concerned for the pre&s;ervation of Fi|delia's honour, who&s;e my&s;terious &s;ituation is &s;o un|accountable: to clear up the doubts that naturally ari&s;e, Sir Charles advi&s;es his friend to bring young Belmont, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to an explanation of whom the young lady really is; Sir Roger &s;eeing his &s;on approach, re&s;olves to attack him on this point.</P>
<P>The young gentleman enters, repeating &s;ome rapturous lines; the father, upon his mentioning that times are hard, ob&s;erves, that he ought, as her Guardian, to improve Fidelia's money, and that a good round &s;um may be thrown into the &s;tocks to advantage; this throws the young gentleman in|to confu&s;ion, and occa&s;ions a very laughable &s;cene of equivocation; after bearing a great deal, the old man &s;eems to conceive matters in the right light, and gives, at his going off, an intimation which &s;tartles young Belmont; he thinks his &s;i&s;ter concern|ed in the affair, and re&s;olves, by the aid of Faddle, to out-plot her; &s;he joins him, and after playing agreeably through &s;ome &s;peeches upon patience, the definition of a coquette, and that of a rake oc|cur, which are both plea&s;antly given; however, we think, as a brother, young Belmont explains him&s;elf too far.</P>
<P>Seeing the Colonel, he goes off, and leaves him to a tete-a-tete with the young lady; this &s;erious &s;on of Mars addre&s;&s;ing his mi&s;tre&s;s in the &s;olemn way, &s;he a&s;ks him if he is a rake; and demanding how he would behave to her if really &s;uch a character, the Colonel collects unu&s;ual &s;pirit; ki&s;&s;es her hand,
<PB N="210" REF="216">
and breaths a glow of rapture, which &s;he receives ironically, and thereby draws him again into the &s;erious mood, nay even works him into a degree of warm re&s;entment, which al&s;o &s;he treats lightly.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as the Colonel is fooled to the top of his bent, Faddle appears, and immediately feels &s;ome effect of the Colonel's choler, while the frighted Fop is in con&s;ternation at the rough treatment he has met, young Belmont and Fidelia join the com|pany; this gives him a re&s;pite, and by degrees he is led on to a laughable account of him&s;elf and his companions; however, the author has certainly given him too much of this whip &s;illabub &s;tuff. A &s;ervant whi&s;pering Ro&s;etta that dinner is ready, &s;he a&s;ks the gentlemen to partake, but Belmont having engaged Faddle to dine at a tavern, they remain while the other characters go off; when by them&s;elves, Belmont gives Faddle a pur&s;e, by way of retaining fee, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in getting Fide|lia out of his father's hou&s;e, as &s;he is there too &s;ecure from his licentious de&s;igns; he owns him&s;elf to be only a fictitious guardian, and partly opens the manner in which he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her; Faddle, who &s;eems, as his employer ob&s;erves, fit for any ra&s;cality, immediately &s;ugge&s;ts to him&s;elf a method of throwing the family into &s;uch confu&s;ion as may an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; pregnant with this hopeful de&s;ign, they ha&s;ten off to dinner and conclude the &s;econd act.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third, Ro&s;etta and Fide|lia pre&s;ent them&s;elves, conver&s;ing upon the &s;ame &s;ubject that employed their fir&s;t &s;cene; the former in&s;i&s;ts that cruelty, or &s;eeming cruelty to gallants, is the be&s;t treatment of them; Fidelia differing
<PB N="211" REF="217">
this opinion, a pretty and pertinent &s;ong is intro|duced; a &s;ervant brings a letter, the contents of which affect Ro&s;etta &s;o &s;trongly, that &s;he de&s;ires him to go for her brother and Faddle to the tavern where they dined. Fidelia reque&s;ts to be a par|taker of her friend's concern, which, after &s;ome he&s;itation is granted, by &s;hewing the letter.</P>
<P>Upon peru&s;ing it, and finding her&s;elf not only repre&s;ented as an impo&s;ter but a pro&s;titute, Fidelia's feelings ri&s;e to a tender pitch, and &s;he confe&s;&s;es her|&s;elf not what the &s;croll repre&s;ents, nor what &s;he has been thought. Ro&s;etta, though di&s;agreeable doubts ari&s;e, treats her with cordial gentility; in con&s;e|quence of the me&s;&s;age Faddle comes in, and is tax|ed with his knowledge of the &s;ubject, or the wri|ter of that letter; his eva&s;ions are whim&s;ical; at length, half owning the matter, and laying &s;ome imputation on Fidelia, her re&s;entment &s;o far gets the better of her delicacy, that &s;he &s;trikes him; Ro&s;etta promi&s;es every kind of protection, if he can make any di&s;covery in which the honour of her fa|mily is concerned; or wi&s;hes him poverty and con|tempt if he has him&s;elf any part in trumping up &s;o illiberal and ba&s;e an accu&s;ation.</P>
<P>With the true effrontery of a villain, he treats the matter lightly, and hurries off, leaving it totally unexplained; Ro&s;etta, agitated with doubt, pre&s;&s;es Fidelia to open the affair as much as in her power; which however &s;he declines, through delicacy of a promi&s;e made to young Belmont that &s;he does not chu&s;e to break. Coming in at this critical point of conver&s;ation, his &s;i&s;ter opens the matter, giving him the letter; which he repre&s;ents as the offspring of &s;candal, and threatens to revenge the matter on
<PB N="212" REF="218">
Faddle; as he makes this an excu&s;e for getting off, Fidelia &s;tops him, and mentions that &s;he has own|ed her&s;elf a counterfeit, which he takes umbrage at; however, &s;he begs of him to clear up her cha|racter from the vile and groundle&s;s imputation of pro&s;titution; this he avoids in a very churli&s;h and ungentlemanlike manner.</P>
<P>After his abrupt exit, Ro&s;etta leaves her abu&s;ed friend with a declaration, that &s;he expects to have her doubts cleared, before &s;he can afford conti|nuance of that cordial e&s;teem &s;he has hitherto mani|fe&s;ted; Fidelia, in a &s;hort &s;oliloquy, laments her perplexed &s;ituation, and goes off to make way for her treacherous gallant, who meditates on his own ra&s;cality, and views it in the proper light, yet &s;eems to think him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of honour above lying, and hone&s;ty above deceit; at the &s;ame time, that he does not &s;hew a gleam of contrition, but even re&s;olves to pur&s;ue his &s;candalous purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort conver&s;ation with his vicious agent, that rhap&s;odical fool hints, by way of getting a fre&s;h bribe, qualms of con&s;cience; after &s;ome threats, young Belmont promi&s;es another pur&s;e, if he will bring him word what pa&s;&s;es between Sir Charles Raymond and Fidelia, who are gone into an adjoining chamber; this Faddle cheerfully un|dertakes, and his employer goes to the King's-arms to wait for his intelligence.</P>
<P>The old Baronet and young lady are next di&s;co|vered, in conference upon the letter which has oc|ca&s;ioned &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s; Sir Charles blames Fidelia for too much re&s;erve with Ro&s;etta; &s;he apo|logizes for it by owning her regard for young Bel|mont, which &s;eals her lips: Faddle, true to his tru&s;t,
<PB N="213" REF="219">
appears li&s;tening, and when the old gentleman humanley propo&s;es taking Fidelia under his protec|tion, if Ro&s;etta's &s;u&s;picions &s;hould make the Bel|mont family unea&s;y to her; he catches the idea of her being, as he phra&s;es it, a bit for Sir Charles, and po&s;ts away to the tavern with what he thinks a rare bit of news. Fidelia's tears draw a con&s;ola|tory remark from the Baronet, that he hopes &s;ome|thing may be &s;oon done for her relief; and &s;he ends the act with a pretty thought relative to pati|ence, if it had not been jingled into rhime.</P>
<P>The Colonel and Ro&s;etta commence the fourth act, he renewing his addre&s;&s;es, and &s;he continuing her coquetti&s;h raillery: the Colonel, in compliance with his mi&s;tre&s;s's de&s;ire, gives the following pretty and ju&s;t de&s;cription of matrimony.  <Q REND="inline">"To fools, madam, it is the jewel of Ae&s;op's cock; to the wi&s;e a diamond of price in a &s;kilful hand to enrich life; it is happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, as minds are differently di&s;|po&s;ed. The nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ites are love, good &s;en&s;e, and good breeding; the fir&s;t to unite, the &s;econd to advi&s;e, and the third to comply; if you add to the&s;e neatne&s;s and a competency, beauty will always plea&s;e, and family cares become agreeable a|mu&s;ements."</Q></P>
<P>Ro&s;etta animadverts plea&s;antly upon this picture of the married life, and &s;till dallies with the amorous Colonel; at la&s;t, &s;he changes the di&s;cour&s;e to Fide|lia, of whom &s;he &s;peaks in a friendly manner; and tells her gallant, that if he hopes to make love &s;uc|ce&s;sfully, it mu&s;t be by endeavouring to clear up the perplexity of her fair friend, then propo&s;es to vi&s;it her with him.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="220">Young Belmont and Faddle pre&s;ent them&s;elves, conver&s;ing upon the &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;ign of Sir Charles, in offering Fidelia apartments, which the latter de|clares to be with a vicious intention. Seeing the old baronet approach, young Belmont retires, and leaves his worthy a&s;&s;i&s;tant to banter him; for which purpo&s;e he addre&s;&s;es Sir Charles with all the fami|liarity of an unblu&s;hing coxcomb, offers his &s;ervice, but &s;neeringly ob&s;erves, that old poachers hunt &s;ure; with other impertinent remarks, which the baronet &s;eems not to under&s;tand, till he draws Faddle into a repetition of his own words, concerning the apart|ments, and Fidelia's acknowledgment for the pro|po&s;ed favour. Rou&s;ed by his in&s;olent ribaldry and &s;candalous in&s;inuation, Sir Charles &s;huts the door; this alarms the con&s;cious &s;coundrel, who, after two or three hearty &s;hakes by the collar, fir&s;t confe&s;&s;es that he did li&s;ten, and next acknowledges his having forged, with young Belmont's connivance, the ano|nymous letter which has cau&s;ed &s;o much pain and confu&s;ion. Having thus made the di&s;covery he wanted, Sir Charles di&s;mi&s;&s;es the para&s;ite, with a mo&s;t excellent lecture; &s;o de&s;criptive of &s;uch rep|tiles, and &s;o pregnant with in&s;tructive truth, that we beg leave to offer it our readers.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Thy life is a di&s;grace to humanity; a fooli&s;h prodigality makes thee needy; need makes thee vi|cious, and both make thee contemptible; thy wit is pro&s;tituted to &s;lander and bu&s;&s;oonery; and thy judg|ment, if thou ha&s;t any, to meanne&s;s and villainy. Thy betters, who laugh with thee, laugh at thee; and who are they? the fools of quality at court, and tho&s;e who ape them in the city; the varieties of thy life, are pitiful rewards and painful abu&s;es; for
<PB N="215" REF="221">
the &s;ame trick that gets thee a guinea to-day, &s;hall get thee beaten out of doors to-morrow; tho&s;e who care&s;s thee are enemies to them&s;elves, and when they know it will be enemies to thee; in thy di&s;tre&s;&s;es they'll de&s;ert thee, and leave thee at la&s;t to &s;ink in thy poverty, unregarded and unpitied; if thou can&s;t be wi&s;e, think of me, and be hone&s;t."</Q></P>
<P>Faddle, thus &s;everely catechi&s;ed, feels him&s;elf in a fre&s;h dilemma, upon the approach of young Bel|mont; however, having cleared him&s;elf of one &s;crape by telling of truth, he determines to e&s;cape another, by means of lying heartily. To this end he tells young Belmont, that Sir Charles has made him a confidante, but the a&s;&s;ertion is deemed apo|cryphal. Seeing Sir Charles returning he decamps, prudently re&s;olving never to &s;et his foot in the hou&s;e again.</P>
<P>The baronet comes on with a &s;ervant, who has delivered him a letter, purporting, that if the intere&s;t of his family be dear to him, it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;|&s;ary that he &s;hould attend the bearer of the letter; this extraordinary &s;ummons &s;tartles him, but howe|ver important, he &s;ays there is another concern that mu&s;t precede it. Here young Belmont a&s;king what news, Sir Charles attacks him in an emphatic &s;train of &s;pirited reproach, for his de&s;ign upon Fidelia, which he only an&s;wers by recrimination; and the baronet's noble, di&s;intere&s;ted &s;entiments, place Bel|mont's equivocation and fal&s;e fire in a contemptible light; even his challenge is foiled with di&s;grace, by the old gentleman's unan&s;werable method of treat|ing it. Being told of Faddle's di&s;covery, he takes &s;hame to him&s;elf with a tolerable grace, and appears ready to make any reparation. Sir Charles de&s;ires
<PB N="216" REF="222">
him to undeceive his &s;i&s;ter, and then goes to the bearer of the letter. When alone, Belmont takes a ju&s;t view of his proceedings, which he finds as weak as they have been de&s;picable; and feels perplexity ri&s;e &s;o fa&s;t, that he re&s;olves to fly upon the wings of penitence to injured Fidelia, and &s;eek from her advice that peace of mind he cannot &s;trike out for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, Sir Roger Bel|mont enters, con&s;iderably fluttered with a letter he has received; which letter, from a pretended guar|dian of Fidelia's, threatning a law-&s;uit for &s;tealing her, he &s;hews to Sir Charles in great anxiety, and de|termines that &s;he &s;hall be packed off immediately; but this ha&s;ty re&s;olution his friend di&s;&s;uades him from, and they retire to con&s;ult upon the matter.</P>
<P>Young Belmont, in the next &s;cene, receives &s;ome very ju&s;t and keen reproaches from Fidelia, for the ba&s;e treatment &s;he has received from him; he pleads hard to obtain forgivene&s;s, yet, though a violence to her love, which &s;he candidly acknowledges, &s;he holds him at a di&s;tance. Thus pre&s;&s;ed in his feel|lings, he offers marriage, but this al&s;o, on a generous principle; &s;he declines. Ro&s;etta here joins them, full of the intelligence that Fidelia has been &s;tolen by her brother, and that her guardian is at hand to demand &s;atisfaction. This, young Belmont receives as a plea&s;ing piece of information; he is going to explain the &s;tory of Fidelia, when Sir Roger, Sir Charles, the Colonel, and Villiard enter, the latter of whom is informed, that if he claims the lady, and makes good his claim, &s;he &s;hall be re&s;tored without any he&s;itation.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;erts her to be his ward, and that &s;he was &s;tolen by violence from him by Belmont. His
<PB N="217" REF="223">
proofs being demanded, he evades the point, and &s;ays, they &s;hall be produced in a court of law. Fi|delia is then que&s;tioned, who, after his accu&s;ations have been heard, draws a pathetic picture of Vil|liard's brutal attempt, which Mr. Belmont, by mere accident, &s;aved her from.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of having relieved di&s;tre&s;&s;ed innocence, gives Sir Roger a generous feeling of joy for his &s;on's humane, gallant interpo&s;ition. Vil|liard, finding no probability of &s;ucce&s;s by &s;taying, goes off, with warm threats. Ro&s;etta a&s;king who the anonymous &s;croll, written by Faddle, came from, her brother frankly owns he had a hand in it; and, by way of reparation, offers to take the young lady for life: here Sir Roger's love of money cuts off his con&s;ent. This draws a mo&s;t generous propo&s;al from Colonel Raymond, which is to take Ro&s;etta without a fortune, &s;o her's may be be&s;towed on Fi|delia. While matters remain dubious, and a good deal of delicacy is manife&s;ted on all &s;ides, Sir Charles &s;teps in, and declares, that he will make Fidelia e|qual to Sir Roger's utmo&s;t wi&s;h, in point of pro|perty; and, in a few lines after, with a melting flow of paternal tenderne&s;s, declares her to be his daugh|ter. The general a&s;toni&s;hment ari&s;ing from this unexpected di&s;covery, he removes by the following explanation: That at the time of his bani&s;hment, he left this daughter, an infant, to the care of a wo|man, who, to &s;ecure &s;ome jewels, made the child believe &s;he was a Foundling, and changed her name of Harriet to Fidelia, that at twelve years old &s;he &s;old her to Villiard; that being &s;eized with &s;udden illne&s;s, and having heard of Sir Charles's return, &s;he had &s;ent for him, and from apprehen&s;ions of death,
<PB N="218" REF="224">
confe&s;&s;ed the whole; thereby proving the idendity of a child, which, during his exile, &s;he &s;ent him word was dead. Matters brought to this agreeable cri&s;is, all parties are made happy; the two young couple, by interchange of hands, and the old baro|nets, by &s;eeing their children united according to mutual inclinations.</P>
<P>Young Belmont concludes the play with a very apt deduction from his own mi&s;conduct, and a &s;en|&s;ible remark&mdash;would it had not been made in rhime&mdash; that libertini&s;m preys upon that beautiful, weak part of the creation, which it is man's natural pro|vince to defend.</P>
<P>The piece now con&s;idered, has proved a very a|greeable &s;ubject for critici&s;m, having much to prai&s;e, and little to cen&s;ure; for however per&s;ons who feel, and &s;hrink at, the touch of our rod, may think we tend to &s;everity, it is an undoubted fact, that we are infinitely better plea&s;ed to point out merit than de|ficiencies, in both writing and performance.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that this play was evidently bor|rowed from the CONSCIOUS LOVERS, but we can perceive no &s;triking &s;imilitude to authori&s;e that opi|nion; the di&s;covery of a daughter in each, is not &s;ufficient to &s;upport the remark; there is indeed &s;ome likene&s;s between Fidelia and Indiana, but all the other characters differ e&s;&s;entially.</P>
<P>In the FOUNDLING, critical unities are well pre|&s;erved, and the plot lays proper hold of &s;u&s;pence and attention; there are no make-&s;hift &s;cenes, nor any that are tedious; &s;everal excellent.</P>
<P>Sir Roger Belmont has nothing peculiar to mark him, and may be called a good kind of an old fel|low; only a little tainted with the love of money.
<PB N="219" REF="225">
If the author had done half as much in writing the part, as Mr. YATES did in acting it, Sir Roger would have been as con&s;picuous as any man in the piece. Mr. LOVE, to tho&s;e who have not &s;een the forementioned gentleman, may pa&s;s very well.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Raymond is an object of great e&s;teem, his tender concern for Fidelia, before he knows any more of her than that &s;he is young, beautiful and in dangerous hands, recommends him much; the manner of cha&s;ti&s;ing both Faddle and Belmont, on her account, does equal honour to his ju&s;tice, his humanity, his &s;pirit, and his good &s;en&s;e. Tho' we never admired Mr. BARRY in pro&s;e dialogue, yet it would be very injurious not to allow, that where the part materially called upon him, he powerfully an|&s;wered. In the fourth act, he &s;upported the cha|racter with emphatic dignity; in the la&s;t, with melt|ing tenderne&s;s; we dont recollect any body who could have been better. Mr. BERRY was heavy, un|graceful, and out of character: Mr. BANNISTER has no expre&s;&s;ion of &s;oft feelings, but &s;peaks the four fir&s;t acts very well, and figures the part agreea|bly. Mr. POWELL had requi&s;ites to render Sir Charles Raymond very plea&s;ing; and Mr. RED|DISH would do him more ju&s;tice than any other part in the play.</P>
<P>Young Belmont is very cen&s;urable as a man; he does the meane&s;t things, even under &s;elf-conviction, with no other plea of excu&s;e than the pitiful one, that his appetites drive him on; had he ru&s;hed up|on vice, without giving him&s;elf time to think, he would have been more bearable; a &s;peculative li|bertine is the mo&s;t dangerous, and mo&s;t incurable. His re&s;cuing Fidelia mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an action

<HEAD>The EARL of ESSEX. A TRAGEDY, by Mr. JONES.</HEAD>
<P>SO intere&s;ting has the &s;tory of E&s;&s;ex been con|&s;idered, at lea&s;t &s;o advantageous a light has BANKS, who fir&s;t wrote upon the &s;ubject, placed it in, that there have been no le&s;s than three plays &s;truck out upon his plan; we have cho&s;en that by Mr. JONES, as being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, and, in many re&s;pects, the be&s;t compo&s;ition; though produced by a man who&s;e whole dependance was on natural genius, of which he gave &s;everal &s;trong proofs, and might have furni&s;hed more, had his conduct any way coincided with his talents; but like many other unhappy &s;ons of the mu&s;e, his life was a di&s;|grace to his writings, and though his capacity gained him many friends, the turbulence and in|gratitude of his temper, prevented him from ever keeping one; but his work being more properly the object of our concern, we'll proceed to that, without further comment on its imprudent au|thor.</P>
<P>Burleigh, the leading and very able mini&s;ter of Eliza's reign, begins this piece with acquainting Raleigh that a bill to clip the wings of E&s;&s;ex's ambition has pa&s;&s;ed; he a&s;ks for coroborating proofs, which Sir Walter &s;ays are arrived; &s;uch as his making a private treaty with Tyrone, and the Scots King, calculated to ruin Burleigh in his Mi&s;tre&s;'s opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="230">Wary Cecil de&s;ires that this plea&s;ing piece of intelligence may be kept, like a battery concealed, to play upon the enemy by &s;urpri&s;e; a me&s;&s;enger announcing the approach of Lady Nottingham, Burleigh con&s;iders what her bu&s;ine&s;s may be, as knowing her to have a partial regard for E&s;&s;ex; he prepares again&s;t any artifice &s;he may u&s;e in that peer's favour, and di&s;patches Raleigh to watch the motions of Southampton and his friends, ob|&s;erving, that as a leader of faction, he mu&s;t be ta|ken care of. After &s;ome compliments from Not|tingham, on his great abilities as a &s;tate&s;man, Cecil is acquainted by her that &s;he has renounced E&s;&s;ex; &s;he acknowledges having heretofore joined with him in his de&s;igns again&s;t the mini&s;ter, but now determines to counteract tho&s;e de&s;igns, which a blind pa&s;&s;ion for E&s;&s;ex made her promote; as her re&s;entment ari&s;es from a &s;light thrown on her charms, Burleigh with great addre&s;s improves her indignation, by mentioning the preference given to Rutland, even &s;o far as their being united by a &s;e|cret marriage before the Earl's &s;etting off for Ire|land.</P>
<P>This intelligence, like oil on flames, throws the Counte&s;s's temper into a blaze, and &s;he execrates them in terms which we think too gro&s;s for her rank, though moved by jealou&s;y. Upon Burleigh's pro|po&s;ing to work him out of royal favour, the only bar to his ruin, &s;he gladly accepts the office of im|bittering his royal mi&s;tre&s;s again&s;t him, and goes off fully determined to try every method for effect|ing, not only his fall but death. Here Raleigh enters, and &s;peaks of Southampton's approach.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="231">That Earl, in the full glow of friendly re&s;ent|ment, accu&s;es Burleigh of putting in practice ini|quitous mea&s;ures, for the de&s;truction of a worthy man and a good &s;ubject; the politician &s;tands his warm reproaches with very prudent coolne&s;s, and a&s;&s;erts his own good intentions with confidence; throwing out an in&s;inuation that too violent an at|tachment to E&s;&s;ex's cau&s;e may involve the hardy friend in his fall. This oblique threat Southamp|ton treats with contempt, and mentions how inef|fectually malice mu&s;t labour to tear the wreaths of honour from E&s;&s;ex's brow; this brings the conference to an end, and Cecil goes off ob&s;erv|ing, that the queen &s;hall judge of their debate; Southampton, after a warm effu&s;ion of friend|&s;hip, in &s;oliloquy, follows him to the royal pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth, &s;eated on her throne, expre&s;&s;es di&s;plea&s;ure at the bill of impeachment pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t E&s;&s;ex, without her privity or con&s;ent; upon this point &s;he &s;peaks warmly to Cecil, charging him with it; this he evades, but confe&s;&s;es a concur|rence of opinion with parliament. While her Maje&s;ty is on the fret, Southampton enters, to whom &s;he &s;hews what &s;he calls the ba&s;e portrait of E&s;&s;ex; this gives him a fair opening for the de|fence of his friend, which he undertakes, by paint|ing in nervous terms his innocence and loyalty. After a general reproof concerning the bill, the Queen di&s;mi&s;&s;es all but Burleigh, to whom &s;he gives an order for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it: he begs the Queen to con&s;ider how unpopular &s;uch a &s;tep would be, and mentions proofs; however, &s;he will hear nothing that way, and with an amiable
<PB N="226" REF="232">
degree of generous ju&s;tice, declares accu&s;ation mu&s;t cea&s;e, till he can make a per&s;onal defence. After Burleigh goes off, Elizabeth expre&s;&s;es her good opinion of E&s;&s;ex, though &s;he knows his weak|ne&s;s: a hint is dropped of the place he has in her heart; &s;he &s;eems to view Burleigh in the right light, and concludes the fir&s;t act, with determining to &s;hield E&s;&s;ex again&s;t his fraudful machinations.</P>
<P>Cecil, at the beginning of the &s;econd act, con|fe&s;&s;es to Raleigh, that the unexpected return of E&s;&s;ex rather confu&s;es him; however, he &s;ends for Nottingham, and determines to alarm the Queen as much as po&s;&s;ible; finding affairs brought to this critical &s;ituation, that E&s;&s;ex or he mu&s;t be &s;acri|ficed. The queen upon her entrance, expre&s;&s;es much &s;urpri&s;e, that her favourite &s;hould return from his command in Ireland without leave; finding her temper warmed, and therefore in &s;ome mea&s;ure fit|ted to receive an unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion of E&s;&s;ex, Burleigh mentions the &s;ecret treaty with Tyrone and the Scots King, tending, through the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of E&s;&s;ex and his friends, to attack even her native I&s;le; at fir&s;t, &s;he doubts this &s;trange a&s;&s;ertion, but upon, con&s;idering &s;o great a breach of duty in her general, as to leave his command without any authority but his own will; &s;he collects all the dig|nity of &s;tation, and orders the culprit into her pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>After an introductory addre&s;s of Southampton's, the Earl of E&s;&s;ex appears, and, with a becom|ing degree of humiliation, addre&s;&s;es his &s;overeign, and apologizes for his conduct, by alledging, that he thought it proper, in per&s;on, to oppo&s;e &s;candal and the undermining efforts of envy; the Queen
<PB N="227" REF="233">
does not &s;eem to con&s;ider this exculpation as he could wi&s;h, and ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that the glow of language is, in his ca&s;e, but of little u&s;e; that having appeal|ed from her to the laws, he mu&s;t abide by the laws.</P>
<P>After Elizabeth and her courtiers are retired, E&s;&s;ex ruminates, in &s;oliloquy, upon the ill return his martial dangers and fatigues meets; he deter|mines to &s;tand the &s;hock of adver&s;ity with re&s;o|lution, &s;eeming to think his ruin inevitable. South|ampton returns, and tells his friend, that the Queen's di&s;plea&s;ure, cheri&s;hed by Lord Burleigh, increa&s;es; the ficklene&s;s of courts E&s;&s;ex &s;eems to de&s;pi&s;e, and de&s;ires, as a more material concern than his political affairs, to be led where he may &s;ee his mourning lady; this he is warned again&s;t, as a dan|gerous &s;tep, it being nece&s;&s;ary that their marriage at this particular juncture, &s;hould be concealed. Burleigh, by the Queen's command, demands E&s;&s;ex's &s;taff of office; this inflames him to utter har&s;h terms again&s;t his undermining foe, and he de|clares, that having from her own hand received it, to her alone he will re&s;ign it. Southampton goes once again upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of interce&s;&s;ion to &s;of|ten the Queen, and leaves his friend &s;till further to con&s;ider the in&s;tability of human greatne&s;s; this &s;oliloquy has con&s;iderable merit, the imagery is agreeable and &s;triking, without any &s;train of con|ception.</P>
<P>Rutland, with all the joy and tenderne&s;s of an affectionate wife, here flies into her hu&s;band's arms, who, for a moment, forgets his fallen &s;tate; and, when he recollects it, re&s;olves to fly from courtly ingratitude to the &s;weets of retirement, with his be|loved

object. Rutland ob&s;erving the danger they &s;tand in of a di&s;covery, being in one of the Queen's apartments, E&s;&s;ex leads her off, with the plea&s;ing idea of calm content, when &s;eparated from the hou&s;e of greatne&s;s, where hone&s;ty and plain dealing are for|bidden &s;helter.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, Nottingham meets Burleigh, and enquires what occurred, after the Earl's audience of the Queen: this Burleigh relates, &s;ignifying, that her maje&s;ty was highly di&s;|plea&s;ed at his refu&s;al to return the &s;taff of office, in compliance with her po&s;itive mandate; that her pa&s;|&s;ion went &s;o far as to threaten him with death; then &s;oftened into a recollection of his many &s;hining qua|lities, and turned reproach on Cecil, for driving him, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, to &s;uch extremes; however, that after many changes for and again&s;t, &s;he had ordered E&s;&s;ex to the Tower; but, in conclu&s;ion, command|ed him to be brought into her pre&s;ence. A me&s;&s;age coming to Nottingham from the Queen, de&s;iring her attendance in the royal clo&s;et, Burleigh &s;ugge&s;ts, that it is to con&s;ult her concerning E&s;&s;ex, and urges her to make the mo&s;t of &s;o favourable an opportu|nity, of &s;tirring maje&s;ty to more e&s;&s;ential re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The Queen, di&s;covered in &s;oliloquy, &s;eems deep|ly concerned for E&s;&s;ex's weakne&s;s of temper; which, with the artifice of his foes, places him in &s;uch a pe|rilous, and pitiable &s;ituation; her pride appears hurt at his re&s;i&s;tance, but love &s;oftens that pride in|to compa&s;&s;ion. Here Nottingham, pregnant with all the fatal malevolence of jealou&s;y, approaches Elizabeth, who tells her of E&s;&s;ex's contemptuous behaviour; at which, to cover her purpo&s;e the bet|ter, &s;he &s;eems &s;urprized; but, as the conference
<PB N="229" REF="235">
proceeds, &s;tirs up the flame again&s;t him &s;o far, that the Queen perceives a de&s;ign of urging &s;everity, which &s;he checks, and de&s;ires Nottingham to &s;end Rutland; then ruminates on the painful &s;tate of &s;olitary grandeur, which, wanting the free, comfort|able communication of &s;ocial equality, is forced to bear its griefs and anxieties alone.</P>
<P>When Rutland appears, Elizabeth a&s;ks her opi|nion and coun&s;el, re&s;pecting E&s;&s;ex: the Counte&s;s a&s;&s;erts, that his faults are created by envy, that they have no real exi&s;tence; and &s;peaks of E&s;&s;ex in &s;uch terms, that the Queen, with eagle-eyed jealou&s;y, which however &s;he conceals for &s;ome time, perceives her partial regard for the Earl: at length, Rutland's zeal goes &s;o far, that her royal mi&s;tre&s;s di&s;mi&s;&s;es her the pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex, conducted by Burleigh and others, pre&s;ents him&s;elf, while the Queen is agitated: &s;he demands why he refu&s;ed to yield his &s;taff; to this he replies, that it was his wi&s;h to lay his honours at the feet of her who had conferred them: on being charged with a &s;elf-&s;ufficiency of &s;peech, he pays him&s;elf &s;ome compliments, which no degree of provocation would draw from a man of real &s;en&s;e. At the charge of making a &s;hameful compromi&s;e with rebels, E&s;&s;ex &s;eems to think his life levelled at; however, as an exculpation, he a&s;&s;erts having been inve&s;ted with di&s;cretionary power, and ob&s;erves, that the circum|&s;tance of affairs obliged him to u&s;e that power as he had done. This defence he makes in terms that we think highly provocative, and therefore applaud the Queen's re&s;entment, till &s;he degrades her rank and &s;ex, by &s;triking him. This, we naturally &s;uppo&s;e, rou&s;es his impetuous temper &s;till more; however,
<PB N="230" REF="236">
his fury vents it&s;elf only again&s;t the court tools, whom he violently threatens. After the Queen's departure, he gives an enlarged &s;cope to rage; and, notwith&s;tanding Southampton's palliative advice, vehemently, at all hazards, determines upon re|venge.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act, we find, by Elizabeth's enquiry and Nottingham's an&s;wer, that E&s;&s;ex has been guilty of &s;ome outrage again&s;t the peace and dignity of government; that force has obliged him to an e&s;cape, and that he is fled to a place near the Thames, where re&s;i&s;tance on his part is re&s;olved. This behaviour, &s;o unpardonable in its nature, wounds the Queen's regard for him deeply, and &s;he expre&s;&s;es her concern pathetically, but recollecting her &s;tation, calls up becoming &s;pi|rit.</P>
<P>Burleigh acquaints the Queen that E&s;&s;ex, South|ampton, and all their factious adherents are &s;ecured; that their de&s;ign, could they have gained over the citizens to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, was no le&s;s than attacking her royal per&s;on; that all the characters of le&s;&s;er note concerned in this traiterous attempt have been &s;ecured, but that the two Earls, and others of di|&s;tingui&s;hed rank, are left to her maje&s;ty's di&s;po&s;al: this account draws from Elizabeth &s;ome pertinent and affecting remarks on the ingratitude of &s;ubjects, ready to ri&s;e again&s;t a monarch, who has always &s;tudied their advantage, collectively and indivi|dually.</P>
<P>She orders E&s;&s;ex to a private audience, and when he appears, addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf to him in very &s;ting|ing terms, which he receives with all the angui&s;h of remor&s;e and &s;elf-conviction; with this &s;he &s;eems
<PB N="231" REF="237">
touched, and coolly expo&s;tulates with him on the ungrateful return he has made her bounty, &s;o pe|culiarly manife&s;ted to him; then ob&s;erves with cor|dial concern, that &s;he fears the public voice will force him to the peril of his life; but to palliate the pain of his &s;u&s;pence declares, that &s;he, as an indivi|dual, is willing to forgive his errors freely and fully. The apology he makes for his conduct is plau&s;ible, but no way conclu&s;ive; however it touches Elizabeth's heart, already &s;o prejudiced in his favour, and &s;he condoles with him mo&s;t hu|manely: at length, being wrought up to a particular pitch of tenderne&s;s, &s;he gives him a ring, with her royal promi&s;e, that if public ju&s;tice &s;hould &s;en|tence his life, upon returning that token of her favour, he may be &s;ure of finding clemency.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ecured from public and private foes, E&s;&s;ex retires, with expre&s;&s;ions of fervent gratitude; after &s;he delivers him to cu&s;tody, a foreboding &s;its heavy on her heart, but &s;he determines to &s;tand between him and danger, however popular clamour may cen&s;ure her protection.</P>
<P>Rutland, naturally afflicted, and urged on by her hu&s;band's &s;ituation, not knowing the degree of favour in which he &s;tands, notwith&s;tanding his mi&s;|conduct, pleads to the Queen for his life and un|happily lets fall that he is her hu&s;band. This un|expected intelligence fixes a dagger in Elizabeth's heart; &s;he orders the Counte&s;s, who&s;e grief bor|ders on di&s;traction, to be taken from her pre&s;ence, and after that order is fulfilled, concludes the fourth act, with painting in &s;trong, and expre&s;&s;ive colours, the melancholly &s;tate of her own mind;
<PB N="232" REF="238">
we look upon her at this period as an object of great pity, agitated between public duty, private affection, and confirmed jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Raleigh, with the lieutenant of the tower, begin the fifth act, and we are informed, that the two Earls, after a very candid trial by the peers, have been condemned; Nottingham enters, and demands admittance to E&s;&s;ex, which is granted; this revengeful lady comes with de&s;ign to effect a con&s;ummation of vengance, therefore wears the &s;emblance of friend&s;hip, and pretends that the Queen had &s;ent her to know if the Earl has no plea to avert his &s;entence.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex, not &s;u&s;pecting any &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign, after &s;ome thankful compliments for the lady's humane interpo&s;ition, gives her the important pledge; and with it a generous &s;ollicitation for his friends life, without any mention of his own: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this mark of royal regard, the Counte&s;s hurries off, ex|ulting in the pro&s;pect of accompli&s;hing her vindic|tive purpo&s;e; the Queen impatient for Notting|ham's return, appears next; upon &s;eeing her me&s;|&s;enger, &s;he a&s;ks what E&s;&s;ex has &s;aid, Nottingham, with &s;ingular art, works her up gradually, and &s;eems to lament the Earl's &s;ullen, unrelenting ob&s;ti|nacy; and &s;ays that even with death in view, he di&s;dained making any conce&s;&s;ion to injured maje&s;|ty. The Queen, at length, enquires particularly if he made any mention of a ring, which is denied; this circum&s;tance is &s;o &s;triking, that Nottingham &s;eldom fails of getting very rough language from one or more of an audience.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="239">After every aggravation again&s;t the man &s;he wi&s;hes to &s;ave, Elizabeth gratifies Nottingham with an or|der that he may be led to the block; nay, her re|&s;entment is wrought up to &s;uch a pitch, that &s;he even determines upon going to the Tower, that his fate may be imbittered by her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ex and Southampton, habited for the &s;caffold, next appear; the former, giving his friend hopes of life, the latter, with philo&s;ophic re&s;olution, ca&s;t|ing a&s;ide &s;uch flattering ideas. Some of the lines he &s;peaks, we think worthy quotation.</P>
<Q><L>Life! what is life? a &s;hadow,</L>

<L>Nor have we &s;urety for a &s;econd gale;</L>

<L>A frail and fickle tenement it is,</L>
<L>Which like the brittle gla&s;s that mea&s;ures time,</L>
<L>Is often broke ere half its &s;ands are run.</L></Q>
<P>The whole of this &s;cene &s;hews warm friend&s;hip in one, noble re&s;olution in the other. When the Lieutenant of the Tower comes on to &s;ignify that a warrant is arrived for both Earls to &s;uffer, E&s;&s;ex emphatically laments the fate of his friend, and Southampton meets it with a determined, vigorous re&s;olution; but when unexpectedly a pardon comes to the la&s;t mentioned nobleman, he melts into &s;oft|ne&s;s at the fate of his friend E&s;&s;ex, and parts from him in terms of noble, un&s;hakeable friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>After this &s;eparation, Rutland comes to give her hu&s;band yet a &s;everer trial of affliction; &s;he clings about his heart, and melts him almo&s;t to a di&s;|graceful degree of tenderne&s;s: at la&s;t, after many

expre&s;&s;ions of mutual endearment, the Lieutenant &s;ignifies, that time calls &s;o pre&s;&s;ingly, he mu&s;t re|quire the Earl's departure; this throws both E&s;&s;ex and Rutland into an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s, which oc|ca&s;ions very &s;trong feelings among&s;t an audience. At length they are &s;eparated, he goes to his fate, and &s;he is left di&s;tractedly to lament it.</P>
<P>Here the Queen enters, we think much too &s;oon; for, according to her forbiddance of the execution immediately, it is improbable, nay impo&s;&s;ible, the place con&s;idered, that his head could be taken off before her mercy is known; however, &s;o the plot takes its cour&s;e, and Rutland, being di&s;appointed of a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe &s;he had conceived from the Queen's cle|mency, fall into a &s;tate of ab&s;olute madne&s;s, in which Elizabeth humanely offers to comfort her. Burleigh, who brings tidings of the execution, re|lates Nottingham's treachery, which &s;trikes the Queen with fre&s;h concern, as con&s;idering that not only her regard for the man is violated, but even her fame &s;tigmatized; her conclu&s;ive lines have a good moral tendency, had it not been enervated with unnatural and unnece&s;&s;ary rhime.</P>

<P>In the EARL of ESSEX, there are but few cha|racters, con&s;equently mo&s;t of them have &s;ome de|gree of importance. We find the hero brave, loy|al, loving and friendly; &s;trongly tinctured with pride and violence of temper; too open and bold in &s;peech for the ambiguity and fine&s;&s;e of court &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY had every requi&s;ite to render this character agreeable; a fine figure to apologize for all the ladies, even maje&s;ty it&s;elf to be in love with him; a mo&s;t harmonious utterance for the amorous pa&s;&s;ages, fine breaks for the grief, and natural &s;pirit for the rage; he was, through the whole, every thing a critical &s;pectator could wi&s;h, and mu&s;t have plea&s;ed the mo&s;t unfeeling. Mr. ROSS, though greatly inferior to the original, has con&s;iderable me|rit in the part, and &s;upports it much better than mo&s;t capital characters are now &s;upported.</P>
<P>Southampton appears only in the light of a ge|nerous friend, warm and &s;teady in his attachment: Mr. SMITH gave us much plea&s;ure in per&s;onating of him, and we may venture to &s;ay it &s;at ea&s;ier on him than any other tragic character he ever played; why then give it to Mr. BENSLEY, who looks and plays it more in the &s;tile of Bajazet, than that of an ac|compli&s;hed nobleman? Mr. REDDISH fills our idea be&s;t. Burleigh, as pre&s;ented on the &s;tage, is cool, politic and re&s;olute; an excellent judge of charact|er, and equal to any ta&s;k of &s;tate. In ju&s;t veneration of that great &s;tate&s;man's name, we could wi&s;h he had not been drawn on the &s;tage &s;o unfavourably; for his plotting again&s;t E&s;&s;ex, merely as a check to
<PB N="236" REF="242">
his ambition, and a rival in the Queen's favour, is a heavy imputation on Cecil's fame.</P>
<P>Mr. SPARKS repre&s;ented him with becoming dig|nity, and gained that attention we have never per|ceived any other performer obtain, or in the lea&s;t de&s;erve. Mr. GIBSON is horrid to a degree of pain; he does not lay the leaden mace of &s;lumber on his audience, but buffets their ears with &s;ounds more di&s;&s;onant than the hum-&s;trum of a hurdy-gurdy, Mr. GARDNER, who played the part in BROOKS's ESSEX at the Haymarket with merit, &s;hould do this part at Covent Garden.</P>
<P>Queen Elizabeth is a character of importance, though we think underwritten. She has &s;ome weakne&s;s as a woman, none as a monarch; how|ever female inclinations ari&s;e, royalty maintains pre|eminence, and &s;he will be Queen even over the man &s;he loves. Mrs. HAMILTON, by an abundance of teaching, for &s;he could never get out of leading-&s;trings, made a very re&s;pectable figure in the cha|racter, and did the author more ju&s;tice than could be expected from her, e&s;pecially in the tragic &s;tile; her per&s;on, deportment and action, were well adapt|ed. Notwith&s;tanding we have &s;aid thus much in favour of the original, our regard for merit obliges us to &s;ay, that no part was ever &s;poke or felt more properly, than Queen Elizabeth was by Mi&s;s IBBOT, who played it as we remember one night, and no more, at Covent Garden, becau&s;e Mr. RICH, who delighted in oppo&s;ing the opinion of the public, did not concur in the approbation &s;he received. Even at this di&s;tance of time, we remember to have been peculiarly &s;truck with her expre&s;&s;ion in that &s;cene where &s;he gives E&s;&s;ex the ring as a pledge of &s;afety
<PB N="237" REF="243">
from his foes; the whole interview was intere&s;ting, but the&s;e lines &s;he uttered inimitably; by reading the pa&s;&s;age we can &s;carce conceive the additional force &s;he gave it.</P>
<Q><L>With prudence make your be&s;t defence; but &s;hould</L>
<L>Severity her iron juri&s;diction</L>
<L>Extend too far, and give thee up condemned</L>
<L>To angry laws, thy Queen will not forget thee.</L></Q>
<P>Mrs. WARD, who once had con&s;iderable merit, is now &s;o mutilated by time, that &s;he has hardly a trace of her former &s;elf; therefore, we need not be &s;urprized that &s;he makes &s;uch a wretched figure in the Queen and more e&s;pecially as the part never came within her compa&s;s; but however we may pity her, as being commended upon &s;uch a forlorn hope, what apology can we make for the managers, indeed, what can they &s;ay for them&s;elves, to obtrude performance in a capital light, &s;o very inadequate and di&s;graceful to a London theatre. Mrs. HOP|KINS does not tre&s;pa&s;s upon the bounds of decency, but merits no other applau&s;e than &s;ilent &s;ufferance.</P>
<P>Rutland is &s;o circum&s;tanced as to claim our con|cern; her anxious love, her perplexed &s;tate, and her di&s;tracted grief for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, all con|cur to touch the melting heart; the character took happy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mrs. CIBBER, and &s;he of the audience. Her merit never &s;hone more con&s;picu|ou&s;ly than in the la&s;t act of this play, when abound|ing &s;ighs and tears gave her ju&s;t tribute of the true&s;t applau&s;e. Mrs. BARRY, though without power to equal this great original, gives very irre&s;i&s;table &s;en|&s;ation in this part. Mi&s;s MILLER, who rubbed through it lately at Covent Garden, was &s;hamefully
<PB N="238" REF="244">
imperfect; &s;hamefully we &s;ay, becau&s;e no doubt &s;he had due time for preparation. It is the duty of tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t abilities to know the author, how much more incumbent upon them who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch &s;lender talents as this lady, of who&s;e executive powers we will venture to &s;ay, that had &s;he been minutely acquainted with every &s;yllable of Rutland, it is not in her power to do one tenth of the part ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Nottingham is a very di&s;agreeable, yet we believe a natural character, for where jealou&s;y taints the mind of either &s;ex, all moral and &s;ocial concerns are rooted up. She requires a good actre&s;s, and is a painful ta&s;k for &s;uch a one, being all up hill per|formance: Mrs. VINCENT was very improperly cho&s;en for the original, &s;eventeen years ago, and we &s;uppo&s;e is to retain it for life; this is rather more ab&s;urd than Mr. RYAN's doing the part of Marcus in CATO, when he was &s;eventy, becau&s;e he had done it when he was five and twenty&mdash;For heaven's &s;ake, Mr. COLMAN, without dimini&s;hing a worthy wo|man's &s;alary, have &s;ome pity upon critici&s;m, dont compel it to &s;ting through public mi&s;application, &s;o excellent a private character. Where is Mrs. MATTOCKS? She &s;ometimes plays tragedy, though not her fort, and mu&s;t, at lea&s;t in &s;tage appearance, give tolerable grace to what Burleigh hints of charms. Mrs. STEPHENS, though her powers were not equal to the part, yet was capable of giving much &s;atisfaction in this Counte&s;s.</P>
<P>At the Haymarket, la&s;t &s;ummer, the ESSEX of BROOKES was exhibited; though not &s;trictly with|in our plan, being a different piece, perhaps our rea|ders may not be di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;ome &s;trictures on

the performance. Mr. SHERIDAN was bomba&s;tic in the pa&s;&s;ages of pa&s;&s;ion, and di&s;cordant in the ten|der ones; hurtful through extravagance of action to eyes, and painful through fal&s;e modulation of vile tones to ears. Mr. J. AICKIN's Southampton was mode&s;t, &s;en&s;ible, feeling, and within the lines of nature, but rather faint for a large audience: if this gentleman could rouze up a little more ex|pre&s;&s;ion, there is a degree of propriety about him which few reach; why he is placed in &s;uch an ob|&s;cure, di&s;advantageous light at Drury Lane, none but tho&s;e who &s;teer that &s;tate can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay. There are &s;everal parts which Mr. PACKER is inju|diciou&s;ly, or partially packed on for, which would &s;it much ea&s;ier upon him. Mr. GARDNER, whom we have already mentioned as fit to take Mr. GIB|SON's po&s;t, &s;hewed, in his playing of Burleigh, ca|pability for &s;upporting a &s;imilar ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. BURTON! Mrs. PHILLIPPINA BURTON! was the mo&s;t mouthing, &s;trutting, &s;taring, Wapping landlady repre&s;entative of poor Elizabeth, that ever tortured the two delicate &s;en&s;es of &s;ight and hear|ing. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, amid&s;t &s;uch a compli|cation of wretchedne&s;s, whether her ungracious countenance, her lumbering figure, aukward action, wild modulation, or barbarous dialect, gave mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;t; let us advi&s;e this poetical adventurer to change her pen and tragedy &s;ceptre for the rolling-pin or mop, and then &s;he may become a u&s;eful mem|ber of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s HAYWARD, for &s;o inexperienced a perform|er, &s;hewed great merit in Rutland; her la&s;t act was truly affecting; a few vulgari&s;ms, and &s;ome Shere|donian oddities of expre&s;&s;ion, clouded her abilities;

but we think &s;he has the materials about her, with proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance and diligence, to make in a &s;ea&s;on or two the third tragic actre&s;s in our London thea|tres; we wi&s;h the managers impartiality to make the be&s;t u&s;e of her capacity, and her the happy pru|dence to make the be&s;t u&s;e of her&s;elf.

<P>From this tragedy ari&s;es the u&s;eful ob&s;ervation of that danger and mutability which attends court fa|vour. In a compari&s;on of BANKS's, JONES's, and BROOKES's, the former mu&s;t be pronounced replete with offen&s;ive bomba&s;t, forced figures, unnatural ideas, and pitiful expre&s;&s;ion; the &s;econd, regular, cha&s;te and affecting; the third, le&s;s turgid than BANKS, more laboured than JONES; nervous, but &s;tiff; wherefore, we recommend that play which has pa&s;&s;ed review both for action and peru&s;al.</P>

<HEAD>The PLAIN DEALER. A COMEDY, altered from WYCHERLY: By Mr. BICKERSTAFF.</HEAD>
<P>THE comedies of CHARLES the SECOND's time were animated with wit, humour and a cha|racter &s;trongly marked; but had in general a vici|ous tendency; our public ta&s;te being moralized; though private vices are as enormous as ever, the dramati&s;ts of our days make an adherence to de|cency apologize for all the other e&s;&s;entials.</P>
<P>To re&s;cue from oblivion the &s;terling ore of anti|quity; to purge it of gro&s;s alloy is an undertaking worthy of prai&s;e; it is like recovering a picture highly fini&s;hed from ob&s;curing filth; when this is done, without impairing the ma&s;ter's beauties, it &s;hews judgment, and if any retouching is nece&s;&s;a|ry, to blend the addition with an able hand ma|nife&s;ts genius; Mr. BICKERSTAFF found the Plain Dealer a good, but an immoral play; this may &s;eem a &s;oleci&s;m in expre&s;&s;ion, but we mean good as to the leading dramatic qualifications; what he has done by refitting it for public in&s;pection we are now to examine, after premi&s;ing that he has dealt candidly with his original and readers, by marking the additions he cho&s;e to make; thus whatever cen&s;ure or prai&s;e they may de&s;erve, becomes direct|ly and fairly his own.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="248">Manly begins this piece, with opening his own character in a conference with Lord Plau&s;ible, who &s;eems a very di&s;agreeable vi&s;itant. In the cour&s;e of their &s;hort conver&s;ation, they appear &s;trong con|tra&s;ts; one &s;eems churli&s;hly fond of viewing and de&s;cribing human nature in the wor&s;t light, while the other plea&s;es him&s;elf with being the white-wa&s;her of frailty; the wide difference of opinion, makes Manly cut &s;hort the thread of di&s;cour&s;e in a very unho&s;pitable, uncivilized manner; however, the roughne&s;s of one and pliancy of the other, have a plea&s;ing effect.</P>
<P>Oakham, a &s;ea dome&s;tic of Manly's, &s;eeing the peer treated &s;o roughly, &s;oliloquizes, with marine plea&s;antry, upon the incident; gives us to under|&s;tand, that the Plain Dealer is a captain in the na|vy, that he is ju&s;t landed from an un&s;ucce&s;sful cruize, and that he had &s;unk his &s;hip to prevent her falling into the hands of the French: we think this &s;peech of the hone&s;t tar's well introduced.</P>
<P>Manly returning with Freeman, is a&s;ked how he could treat a peer &s;o roughly, when he makes a re|ply which we mu&s;t tran&s;cribe as excellent.  <Q REND="inline">"You are one of tho&s;e who e&s;teem men only by the value and marks which fortune has &s;et upon them, and never con&s;ider intrin&s;ic worth; but counterfeit ho|nours will not pa&s;s current with me, I weigh the man, not his title.

<PB N="243" REF="249">
Manly forbids the admi&s;&s;ion of any more, male or female,</P>
<P>In continuation of the conference between Manly and Freeman, we find the latter kindly endeavour|ing to &s;often the rigidity which characteri&s;es the former. One is for &s;trict truth and open &s;peaking upon all occa&s;ions; the other, for giving way rea|&s;onably to &s;ome cu&s;toms and prejudices of life, that he may not be in a &s;tate of continual warfare with his fellow-creatures. Ju&s;t as Freeman is making a tender of cordial friend&s;hip, Fidelia, di&s;gui&s;ed in men's cloths, enters, and torments Manly's patience with &s;imilar profe&s;&s;ions; he charges his female volunteer with cowardice, and upon that principle di&s;mi&s;&s;es her; &s;he remon&s;trates again&s;t this &s;everity, but in vain.</P>
<P>Here Oakham &s;ignifies the boi&s;terous approach of a clamorous old lady, widow Blackacre, who, by de&s;cription, we find to be the e&s;&s;ence of litigation; &s;o fond of a law &s;uit, that &s;he prefers it to any other enjoyment. Upon her entrance &s;he complains of being kept &s;o long in waiting, to which Manly re|plies, by a&s;king for her niece Olivia, regardle&s;s of the que&s;tion, &s;he proceeds to the &s;tating of a cau&s;e &s;he has in hand; Jerry, her &s;on, is ordered to put the ca&s;e, which, after many interruptions, he at|tempts, but blunders &s;o, that the impatient mother proceeds her&s;elf; till Manly, driven beyond pa|tience, damns the cau&s;e, and all the parties con|cerned. Upon being offered a &s;ubpoena, he flounces out of the room, and leaves the widow to lament his Gothic behaviour.</P>
<P>After he is gone, Freeman makes a kind of ma|trimonial attack upon Mrs. Blackacre, which, for the pre&s;ent, is cut &s;hort, under the idea of affection
<PB N="244" REF="250">
for her &s;on. By the next &s;cene, which is an added one, we learn that Manly has fixed his undivided friend&s;hip upon a man called Varni&s;h, and his love upon a woman called Olivia, not remarkable either for beauty or fortune; however, it appears, that this odd &s;on of Neptune, upon going to &s;ea, had pro|vi&s;ionally left this object of his affection po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no le&s;s than ten or twelve thou&s;and pounds; from a partial opinion of her being, what he thinks rare, a faithful woman. Freeman goes off to plead in Fidelia's favour, and leaves that female to inform us that &s;he is in love with Manly, that &s;he has taken a di&s;gui&s;e to watch an opportunity of gaining his affections, though &s;he knows them to be previou&s;ly engaged.</P>
<P>The Plain Dealer appears dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ignifies to Freeman that he is going out; on being told that it is on a vi&s;it to his mi&s;tre&s;s, with an ob&s;ervation that &s;he mu&s;t be in the phenomenon &s;tile to engage &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition as his, he launches out violently in her prai&s;e, becau&s;e &s;he is con&s;onant in temper, as he imagines, to him. A glaring in&s;tance of weakne&s;s drops from the blunt captain here, which is giving her unlimited credit for reque&s;ting to &s;wear &s;he would not hear the addre&s;&s;es of any per&s;on while he was at &s;ea: as a proof of her valuable and amiable qualifications, he de&s;ires Freeman to call on him at her lodgings in an hour, ob&s;erving, that the young volunteer can &s;hew him where &s;he lives.</P>
<P>Olivia and Eliza begin the &s;econd act: from what pa&s;&s;es between them we find, that the former, though &s;he di&s;claims all liking for gay life and ele|gance of dre&s;s, is warmly attached to both: through the whole of this &s;cene, &s;he di&s;plays contempt of
<PB N="245" REF="251">
every thing that is plea&s;ing to her, e&s;pecially any concern with the male &s;ex: her character opens it|&s;elf, and &s;hews a very palpable mixture of pride, peevi&s;hne&s;s, and prudery.</P>
<P>A foot-boy bringing in word that a gentleman, who frequently comes, de&s;ires admittance, &s;he pro|te&s;ts again&s;t the knowledge of any vi&s;itors: on be|ing told the per&s;on's name, &s;he is rather confu&s;ed, and wants to make Eliza the cau&s;e of his vi&s;it; then gives a character that &s;hews &s;he is intimately ac|quainted with him. With admirable effrontery &s;he calls up Novel, as if to plea&s;e her cou&s;in: this alert &s;prig of fa&s;hion no &s;ooner appears, than he enters upon a &s;ubject very common in modi&s;h life, that is, delineating the characters he dined with the day be|fore; however, Olivia, who profe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf a foe to detraction but a few lines &s;ince, out&s;trips Novel &s;o much in the di&s;&s;ection of Lady Autumn and her daughter, that he attempts to march off, but is de|tained.</P>
<P>Lord Plau&s;ible being mentioned, the tender Oli|via cuts him up too; and Novel is &s;peaking of him in very har&s;h terms at the moment he appears. This turns the &s;cales, all immediately becoming complai&s;ance and cordiality. His lord&s;hip ob&s;erv|ing that he met two worthy characters at Olivia's door, Count Levant and Lord Court-title, there is a fre&s;h field for &s;candal opened, and every one who&s;e name happens to fall in is &s;acrificed; till Eliza, wearied with &s;uch &s;tuff, goes off, and Manly is heard &s;quabbling at the door with the foot-boy: he en|ters, and is a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee Olivia in &s;uch compa|ny; his vexation and &s;urprize are expre&s;&s;ed in pretty
<PB N="246" REF="252">
rough terms, and &s;he replies rather with upbraiding than conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>While Novel and Plau&s;ible are on, he is much agitated, and treats the <HI>things,</HI> as he ju&s;tly calls them, with becoming &s;pirit: at length they retire, rather intimidated, to another room.</P>
<P>Olivia's aggravation, when by them&s;elves, ri&s;es &s;o high, that he renounces her; &s;he coolly goes off, and &s;ays &s;he &s;hall return &s;oon. Fidelia and Free|man, who have overheard the &s;quabble, join the captain, and feel &s;ome rubs from his rouzed fury; however, Freeman urges him to demand a re&s;titu|tion of the money and jewels he had placed in &s;o unworthy a mi&s;tre&s;s's hands. When Olivia ap|pears, Fidelia unites with Freeman in this demand; to which &s;he replies, that what they a&s;k have been delivered to another per&s;on. This awakes the cap|tain, he demands who, &s;he returns, her hu&s;band; and that &s;he dare not hint at their being given back, lea&s;t he &s;hould think &s;he had received them upon unworthy terms.</P>
<P>This affirmative confe&s;&s;ion of deceit provokes Manly &s;o much, that he bids her go off to avoid &s;omething wor&s;e than rough words; &s;he complies, with mo&s;t provoking indifference.</P>
<P>Mrs. Blackacre, Jerry, and Major Oldfox, are introduced: Freeman addre&s;&s;es the widow in very plain and po&s;itive terms, which makes her retort &s;harply: this encourages Oldfox to mention his claim, which the choleric old dame repul&s;es with &s;evere warmth, and is humorou&s;ly &s;atirical; her a|bu&s;e of Freeman goes too far, when &s;he calls him a <HI>lath</HI>-backed fellow: full of law &s;he leaves both
<PB N="247" REF="253">
her old and young gallant, to try if Olivia can in|fluence any of the jury in a depending cau&s;e.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, Manly pre|&s;ents him&s;elf, &s;olus, violently di&s;turbed in thought at Olivia's per&s;idious, unexpected behaviour, and lamenting that the injury he &s;u&s;tains &s;o hardly, was not done by a man, that he might have de|manded and compelled adequate &s;atisfaction; how|ever, he confe&s;&s;es love for her, in &s;pite of &s;uch pe|culiar provocation to wean his mi&s;led affection; while he is wrapped in this painful reverie, Fidelia enters and de&s;ires to be heard a few words, which reque&s;t Manly is loth to comply with, however, being pre&s;&s;ed, and mention of Olivia occurring, he joins conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>When the &s;uppo&s;ed volunteer utters har&s;h terms again&s;t his captain's mi&s;tre&s;s, love gets the better of ill u&s;age, and cau&s;es Manly to threaten Fidelia; after this, with great precaution, he acknowledges his pa&s;&s;ion for Olivia, but confe&s;&s;es it as a great &s;ecret; interprets her culpable behaviour in many favourable lights; in&s;i&s;ts upon Fidelia's going to her hou&s;e, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he may have repented her di&s;dainful behaviour, and may be willing to make &s;ome acknowledgment.</P>
<P>The female volunteer undertakes this commi&s;|&s;ion, in hopes of getting the money and jewels returned, but Manly forbids any idea of that kind, and &s;ays he is going to We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall; here the &s;cene concludes, and that which &s;ucceeds, places us in view of the law market; where Mrs. Black|acre appears, &s;urrounded with long robed harpies, railing at a &s;ollicitor who has pacifically recommend|ed a reference.</P>

Jerry wanting to buy Roche&s;ter's je&s;ts, but not having money to pay for the book, Freeman lays down the price, and laments that a young gentleman, of large expectations, &s;hould be kept &s;o bare; then a&s;ks, why he wont give con|&s;ent to his marrying the widow. This draws from Jerry an explanation of his mother's character, her penury, and &s;pirit of litigation.</P>
<P>Freeman, finding Jerry a good &s;ubject to work upon, puts two guineas into his hand, and they form an alliance again&s;t the old lady. The &s;quire, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an immen&s;e &s;um, goes off with a plea&s;ing remark, that he'll go and pay two &s;hillings he owes, becau&s;e he believes the man wants it. Manly, harra&s;&s;ed by Mrs. Blackacre, about her cau&s;e, enters, declaring he'll be plagued no more with it; when the widow mi&s;&s;es her hopeful &s;on, &s;he hurries off with the Major, to &s;earch for him. Freeman ob&s;erving to his captain, that his patience mu&s;t be pretty well tried, the enraged Plain Dealer replies, that &s;ince his coming into the Hall, he has incurred a challenge and two law-&s;uits.</P>
<P>Seeing Novel approach, he wants to &s;heer off, but being hailed by the beau, brings too. The talkative &s;prite propo&s;es &s;ome in&s;ignificant que&s;ti|ons, which are replied to with a mixture of rough|ne&s;s and contempt. We cannot help thinking this
<PB N="249" REF="255">

What pa&s;&s;es between Freeman and No|vel, might al&s;o be very well &s;pared; when the lat|ter, having made a &s;lip concerning Manly's cou|rage, &s;neaks off, Jerry Blackacre, full of re&s;entment again&s;t his mother, enters, claiming the promi&s;ed a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of his friend Freeman.</P>
<P>Seeing her approach, they go off: the widow here pre&s;ents her&s;elf, fuming with pa&s;&s;ion at the in&s;olence of Jerry, who has threatened to go on board Man|ly's &s;hip; her concern &s;eems not for the &s;on, but the writings he has got with him, on which her jointure and law-&s;uits depend. She goes off, threat|ening Manly, as an accomplice in the boy's elope|ment. Fidelia joins the Plain Dealer, and informs him of Olivia's confirmed infidelity; he doubts for &s;ome time, but when the young volunteer &s;ays, that Olivia has not only made love to him in direct terms, but that he is to be admitted to her bed-chamber at midnight, Manly in&s;i&s;ts on his going, which Fidelia declines. Manly then re&s;olves him|&s;elf to make u&s;e of a garden key &s;he has given him. Freeman's appearance cuts &s;hort their di&s;cour&s;e; the lieutenant informs his captain of Jerry's revolt from maternal authority, and that he intends to make a proper u&s;e of that event.</P>
<P>Manly begins the fourth act with Fidelia: after ob&s;erving, that he has been out all night, and that he now con&s;iders Olivia as the vile&s;t of her &s;ex, he di&s;covers di&s;order in Fidelia's countenance, which &s;hews &s;he has been in tears; he &s;peaks in friendly terms, promi&s;ing protection: he explains
<PB N="250" REF="256">
the method of confirming Olivia's treachery, which was by pa&s;&s;ing in the dark for her expected young volunteer; and de&s;ires that Fidelia, in that cha|racter, to favour his de&s;igns, will write a tender letter to the fal&s;e fair: her objecting to this, &s;ug|ge&s;ts an idea of jealou&s;y to Manly. Upon &s;aying he mu&s;t either give up Olivia or her, he &s;ternly a&s;ks what they have to do with each other: at length, upon an explanation that he only wants through this &s;econd appointment, to confront Olivia with ir|re&s;i&s;table conviction, &s;he goes off to write the pro|po&s;ed letter.</P>
<P>Major Oldfox, though they parted upon &s;uch un|gentleman-like terms in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, is here introduced by Freeman to the Captain, both as a &s;oldier and an author. The old militarian pro|po&s;es employing his pen in a relation of Manly's lo&s;ing his &s;hip, which the tar treats with contempt. Oldfox's remarks upon his own abilities, and Free|man's mode of humouring his ab&s;urdity, are agreea|bly imagined; but this, like &s;everal other &s;cenes, has no kind of connexion with the plot, and &s;eems more calculated to make Oldfox a tolerable part, than to enrich the piece. It appears to us, that the &s;cene which now &s;tands third, would have been more properly placed as &s;econd.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of Freeman's wanting &s;pirit to quarrel with one who had called him an impertinent, in&s;ignificant, ignorant fellow, is &s;omewhat odd for the character of an officer: after the Major retires, we are informed by the Lieutenant, that he has new rigged his charge. Hearing a knock, which is known to be Mrs. Blackacre's, they retire.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="257">The &s;cene changes to Covent Garden Piazza, where we perceive the widow, who declares &s;he won't &s;et foot in Manly's hou&s;e without her lawyer. We wi&s;h Mr. BICKERSTAFF had placed Quillet's cham|bers in any other than <HI>Coney</HI> Court, e&s;pecially as it was to come from a female mouth. Upon Jerry's coming forth in his new habiliments, Mrs. Black|acre takes notice of the change, and being told that he has cho&s;en Freeman for a guardian, &s;he &s;oftens, de&s;iring he will go home with her. An altercation here ari&s;es, in which the characters are extremely well and homorou&s;ly &s;upported: being hard pu&s;hed, and much enraged, the widow &s;acrifices her own re|putation at the &s;hrine of re&s;entment; declaring, that Jerry is ba&s;e born: wherefore, his claim to the family e&s;tate, or choice of a guardian, can have no validity. With this very creditable &s;ubterfuge, &s;he ha&s;tens to Doctor's Commons. Jerry, and his new guardian being alarmed with this unexpected decla|ration, they go off to fight her in her own way, by engaging a con&s;iderable detachment of pettifoggers.</P>
<P>We are now conducted to Olivia's lodgings, where we meet that lady bringing on Verni&s;h, her hu&s;band: the remarkable palpitation &s;he appears in alarms &s;u&s;picion, which &s;he takes endearing methods to ca&s;t a&s;ide; and tells him not only of Manly's return from &s;ea, but of her manner of treating him: here Verni&s;h opens his own character, and &s;hews that he is linked with the woman to impo&s;e on an ea&s;y, un|&s;u&s;pecting temper. We perceive this ra&s;cal to be the <HI>one</HI> friend mentioned by our Plain Dealer in the fir&s;t act, with &s;uch cordiality and confidence.</P>
<P>Olivia mentioning the nece&s;&s;ity of taking means to &s;ecure the money placed in her hands by Manly,
<PB N="252" REF="258">
Verni&s;h goes off for that purpo&s;e, and &s;he gets breathing time. By her &s;oliloquy, it appears, that &s;he repents her marriage, and is very apprehen&s;ive of danger to her young favourite, the volunteer, &s;hould &s;o dark and dangerous a temper di&s;cover her attachment. Here Fidelia pre&s;ents her&s;elf: a con|ver&s;ation en&s;ues, which &s;hews Olivia much ena|moured and very forward. She propo&s;es flying from her hu&s;band; then invites her gallant to a collation in the next room, which we think not very probable, under fear of Verni&s;h's return. Being perplexed with &s;olicitation, Fidelia feigns the ap|proach of a fit; Olivia goes into another chamber for &s;ome &s;pirits, and immediately returns in great confu&s;ion, announcing her hu&s;band's approach: it appears, that while the &s;ervant went for a coach, he had changed his riding dre&s;s. On &s;eeing Fidelia, he acco&s;ts her in very rough terms, indeed very vul|gar ones: why would our alterer furni&s;h &s;uch pa&s;|&s;ages as the&s;e?  <Q REND="inline">"By the <HI>Lord,</HI> you &s;hant &s;lip by me&mdash;<HI>Damn</HI> you, &s;irrah"</Q>&mdash;Fear of death cau&s;es Fi|delia to own &s;he is a woman; of this the brute takes an advantage, and pre&s;&s;es his licentious &s;uit with violence. Her &s;ituation here claims pity, and the audience are judiciou&s;ly left at the end of the fourth act, in a &s;tate of anxious concern for her honour and &s;afety.</P>
<P>Olivia, concerned for her rotten reputation, be|gins the fifth act with Eliza, who comforts her on that point, with ob&s;erving, that her character was &s;o bad before any late incident, it is pa&s;t the attack of any fre&s;h injury. Verni&s;h enters, Olivia, con&s;cious of guilt, craves pardon. This draws from him an expla|nation that the volunteer was a woman, in man's
<PB N="253" REF="259">
cloaths, a di&s;covery made by his pretending to be rude with her. When his wife finds the lover, male or fe|male, has e&s;caped, &s;he turns the tables upon him, and charges Verni&s;h with criminality, where &s;he her&s;elf was guilty. Her hypocri&s;y is very well de&s;cribed; he &s;ooths her pa&s;&s;ion, and begs Eliza to work a re|conciliation.</P>
<P>When he is gone, Olivia, true to vice and effron|tery, di&s;claims any knowledge of a gallant, though clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed thereto by her cou&s;in: in &s;hort, her hardened, negative in&s;olence here, is very character|i&s;tic of a mind &s;teeled again&s;t every ju&s;t and delicate feeling. Her unblu&s;hing confidence warms Eliza, and they part with angry terms.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene we meet Freeman and Manly; the latter mentions Fidelia's e&s;cape from Olivia's lodgings, and makes an appointment with Freeman, for him, Oakham, and as many more as he chu&s;es, to meet at half an hour after &s;even in her chamber. Freeman gone off, Verni&s;h appears, to whom the Captain gives a mo&s;t friendly welcome. This &s;cene produces natural and plea&s;ing perplexity, by Man|ly's boa&s;ting of the la&s;t favour from his &s;uppo&s;ed friend's wife. The exultation of the one, and anxi|ety of the other, are entertaining: the Captain, in rapture, mentions a &s;econd appointment of amo|rous nature, and makes his exit, de&s;iring they may meet at &s;upper. In a &s;ucceeding &s;oliloquy, we find, that Verni&s;h, in order to convict his wife, deter|mines upon making her believe he is under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of going immediately to Oxford; by which means he imagines her guilt or innocence will cer|tainly be brought to light.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="260">Major Oldfox, Mrs. Blackacre, and Coun&s;ellor Quillet, pre&s;ent them&s;elves in the next &s;cene: their conver&s;ation amounts to no more than making the widow's litigious character more &s;trongly apparent, and having no further connexion with the piece, may be deemed an excre&s;cence, obtruded upon the original by Mr. BICKERSTAFF: if the &s;cene which now &s;tands eighth, immediately &s;ucceeded Verni&s;h's &s;oliloquy, it would have been better. Upon being arre&s;ted at the &s;uit of Freeman, as guardian to her &s;on, the old lady bends her high &s;pirit into &s;uppli|cation; however, mercy lies open but one way, which is by marrying the Lieutenant.</P>
<P>Frighted at the lo&s;s of her authority by &s;uch a union, &s;he offers Freeman an annuity of three hun|dred pounds a year, and payment of his debts; ju&s;tly &s;urmi&s;ing, that his view upon her is merely pecuniary advantage. He intimates, that her fa|mily has cheated him of four hundred a year, landed e&s;tate, and propo&s;es, upon a &s;urrender of that property, to give up the guardian&s;hip of Jerry; this, and a &s;tipulation that &s;he &s;hall allow the young gentleman one hundred pounds a year, is agreed to, and they go off to ratify the agree|ment.</P>
<P>Olivia is brought forward in fre&s;h expectation of her young volunteer; Fidelia enters, and in her ma&s;culine capacity &s;u&s;tains a very warm attack, with &s;trong &s;olicitation to make an elopement: up|on hearing a noi&s;e, and di&s;covering that it is her hu&s;band returned, Olivia gives a ca&s;ket, containing jewels and bank notes to a con&s;iderable amount, to Fidelia; who, upon Manly's entrance, gives them to him. Verni&s;h forces a door open, and attacks
<PB N="255" REF="261">
Manly and Fidelia; while they are &s;cuffling by the faint glimmers of a dark lanthorn, Freeman, Plau|&s;ible and Novel enter; when lights appear, the Plain Dealer perceives that Olivia's hu&s;band is the identical friend he had &s;elected from mankind. The play now ha&s;tens to a conclu&s;ion, Manly find|ing that his volunteer is a woman&mdash;we wi&s;h this point had been explained more &s;atisfactory&mdash;he pre&s;ents her with a ca&s;ket, and offers his heart; Fidelia gladly accepts the latter, which &s;he has toiled hard to gain; and makes him acquainted that &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of two thou&s;and pounds a year. We think the cata&s;trophe of this piece very defective, as neither Olivia, Verni&s;h, nor widow Blackacre, are &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed for the bad principles they manife&s;t upon every occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Take this comedy as it is now offered to the pub|lic, we find many &s;cenes of powerful humour, &s;eve|ral very languid: for mo&s;t of the former we are indebted to WYCHERLY, for the latter in general to Mr. BIKERSTAFF, who&s;e alteration has rendered the play more cha&s;te, but not more entertaining. We &s;hould have been happy to allow the &s;ame degree of prai&s;e here we have given the HYPOCRITE, but it is by no means de&s;erved; however, the unities are well pre&s;erved, the plot judiciou&s;ly conducted, the characters, &s;uch as they are, properly maintained, and the dialogue ea&s;y.</P>
<P>Manly is an uncommon, yet not an unnatural character, his &s;pirit of &s;peaking what he thinks upon every occa&s;ion, leads him often to the verge of rudene&s;s, and gives his conver&s;ation a very &s;a|turnine ca&s;t; however, plain dealing in one &s;en&s;e may be a jewel, yet in &s;uch a latitude as the Captain
<PB N="256" REF="262">
u&s;es it, &s;ocial communication becomes hurt by unnece&s;&s;ary, ill-timed truths: if it was commonly practi&s;ed, according to the known feelings of mankind in general, we might expect nothing but con&s;tant bickerings among&s;t neighbours: indeed, it is not every man that enjoys &s;ufficient judgment to di&s;tingui&s;h what are really errors and vices, where, as fools are mo&s;t apt to give their opinion, the re&s;traint of cu&s;tom and civility becomes e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>Manly's &s;ingularity plea&s;es in action, but would be di&s;gu&s;tful in private life; he &s;eems to have an hone&s;t, un&s;u&s;pecting heart, but a wretched weak head; we remember to have &s;een Mr. QUIN exhi|bit the Plain Dealer with &s;ingular merit; the cyni|cal roughne&s;s being in a great mea&s;ure his own di&s;|po&s;ition, became him well; yet, as being more &s;pirited, we are apt to conclude Mr. HOLLAND better&mdash;Mr. AICKIN is indeed a lamentable falling off from both.</P>
<P>Freeman has very little to recommend an actor, the pre&s;ent Mr. PALMER de&s;erves as much prai&s;e as can be merited by &s;uch an in&s;ipid undertaking. Lord Plau&s;ible is very little more than a name, he is a very poor contra&s;t to Manly, has nothing to do with the piece, and &s;carce any thing to &s;ay worth attention; he is totally unworthy of &s;uch plea&s;ing talents as both Mr. PARSONS and Mr. DODD po&s;&s;e&s;s. Novel is equally an excre&s;ence, and &s;till more below the happy execution of Mr. KING; however, there is &s;ome policy and a com|pliment to the public in putting good performers on &s;uch ungracious undertakings.</P>
<P>Verni&s;h is a con&s;ummate knave, a dead weight to drag, and will never be &s;o well &s;upported as by Mr.

LEE. Major Oldfox is meant as a humouri&s;t, but his influence upon the ri&s;ible faculties is very weak; Mr. LOVE &s;upports this opiniated, caroethes &s;cri|bendi coxcomb, better in action than the author has in delineation. Jerry Blackacre we find a very laughable ninny-hammer, placed in &s;everal divert|ing points of view; Mr. YATES no doubt &s;hewed him&s;elf a very good actor in the performance of this part; but for true character and powerful &s;implicity, Mr. WESTON goes far beyond him; nor do we think it too indulgent for critici&s;m to place Mr. W. PALMER &s;econd; who with diligence and countenance from the managers, may make a fir&s;t rate low comedian.</P>
<P>In the character of Olivia, we find an entire want of every amiable qualification; &s;he is proud, &s;landerous, deceitful, fal&s;e to a lover who has con|ferred great obligations upon her, and equally di&s;|po&s;ed to abu&s;e her hu&s;band, for &s;ake of a third per|&s;on; &s;he is &s;o hateful in principles that a good ac|tre&s;s is requi&s;ite to make her &s;ufferable, and &s;uch we admit Mi&s;s POPE &s;hews her&s;elf in this part, though both authors have left it very unfini&s;hed for repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>Fidelia is a lady of the romantic ca&s;t, re&s;olved to have a man at any rate; if love is an excu&s;e for gro&s;s breaches of decorum &s;he may &s;tand excu&s;|ed; however, we cannot help con&s;idering her as a reprehen&s;ible object. Mrs. YATES gave very ade|quate &s;atisfaction in per&s;onating this adventurous fair one, yet notwith&s;tanding her great merit and greater name, we are not afraid to declare that Mrs. BADDELY plea&s;es us better. Mrs. Blacka|cre, who gallops on the hobby hor&s;e of law, retir|ed
<PB N="258" REF="264">
with Mrs. CLIVE to the neighbourhood of Straw|berry-hill, and will not in our judgment return, un|le&s;s Mrs. GREEN takes her by the hand; Mrs. STE|PHENS made &s;ome very un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts upon her la&s;t winter, and Mrs. HOPKINS wor&s;e this. In &s;hort we are &s;urprized that the la&s;t mentioned lady, who has as little humour as pathos about her, &s;hould be bundled into &s;o many characters of importance both tragic and comic. Mi&s;s PLYM, and Mrs. W. BARRY may both be ju&s;tly &s;tiled pretty Eli|zas.</P>
<P>The comedy, whatever prai&s;e it might receive in its original &s;tate from the wits and connoi&s;&s;ures of the la&s;t age, or however it may be improved by the pre&s;ent alteration, has yet many very weak parts, and the remarkable fault of having three characters Plau&s;ible, Novel and Eliza, very near &s;uperfluous. Mr. BICKERSTAFF has &s;oftened &s;ome roughne&s;s of character, and omitted many exceptionable pa&s;&s;ages, for which he de&s;erved both the prai&s;e and profit that attended the undertaking; yet we cannot wi&s;h to &s;ee the play often, nor can we, as its moral is at be&s;t very vague, urge the peru&s;al of it.</P>

<HEAD>TAMERLANE. A TRAGEDY: By ROWE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS tragedy opens in the camp of Tamer|lane: the Prince of Tanais, and two other chiefs, make us acquainted with the character of their il|lu&s;trious ma&s;ter; and point out al&s;o that of his bru|tal antagoni&s;t; who&s;e repeated breaches of faith, in contempt of &s;olemn treaties, has brought them to the eve of a deci&s;ive battle. Tamerlane approaches, meditating beautifully on the deva&s;tation of war. Axalla, with Mone&s;es and Selima pri&s;oners, pre&s;ents him&s;elf at the Emperor's feet, introducing his fair captive, who proves to be the Sultan's daughter. She &s;ues for protection, which is promi&s;ed in the kinde&s;t terms, and &s;he is given, with an in&s;inuation of its being a plea&s;ing ta&s;k, to Axalla's care.</P>
<P>Tamerlane enquiring whether there is any other pri&s;oner of con&s;ideration, Mone&s;es is brought for|ward: touched with Tamerlane's benevolent re|ception, he di&s;clo&s;es the royalty of his lineage, de|rived from the Greek emperors; then mentions being made, together with a female he calls a &s;i&s;ter, captives by Bajazet.</P>
<P>It appears, by his narration, that the Turk had compelled him to take arms; that being &s;ent to guard the Prince&s;s Selima to her father's camp, he had left Arpa&s;ia behind as a pledge of faith; and that by Axalla's &s;uperior fortune, he had fallen into new captivity. Tamerlane, though he entertains a
<PB N="260" REF="266">
high opinion of the honour and intrepidity of Mo|ne&s;es, yet, from a very delicate principle, de&s;ires his &s;word may re&s;t neuter during the impending battle. Tamerlane goes off with a pious addre&s;s to the great di&s;po&s;er of all things, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. When left alone with Selima, Axalla, who had contracted a pa&s;&s;ion for her during his emba&s;&s;y at the Sultan's court, prefers his addre&s;&s;es, which from the idea of being brought into a &s;tate of bondage by him, &s;he at fir&s;t treats with &s;everity; but &s;oftens &s;o far as to acknowledge &s;he entertained tender thoughts of him, till the duty of a child obliged her to con&s;ider him as her father's foe.</P>
<P>She reque&s;ts being delivered to the Sultan, but this the general ob&s;erves is impracticable, con&s;ider|ing the &s;ituation of the armies. Being &s;ummoned to the field, Selima, yielding to the impul&s;e of love, forms ideas of his falling in battle, and gives him every con&s;i&s;tent mark of tender regard, which ani|mates and fills him with happy pre&s;ages of &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;imile with which he takes his leave is &s;uper|fluous, and every one of the rhimes, in the two la&s;t &s;peeches of the fir&s;t act, would be better omitted.</P>
<P>Our author having very judiciou&s;ly left the bat|tle entirely to imagination, begins his &s;econd act with Mone&s;es, who mentions the glorious victory Tamerlane has obtained. Stratocles, the Grecian, brings an account that Bajazet is taken; but being que&s;tioned concerning the fate of Arpa&s;ia, he can &s;ay no more than that there are &s;ome women a|mong&s;t the pri&s;oners. This &s;ends Mone&s;es off, with a damp on that plea&s;ure which he received from Tamerlane's triumph.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="267">The conqueror, &s;eated in his pavillion, receives, with &s;en&s;ible re&s;erve, the compliments of his gene|rals, wi&s;ely con&s;idering him&s;elf and his army, but as &s;econdary cau&s;es of the &s;ucce&s;s they have been crowned with. The following addre&s;s to Axalla, ought to be imprinted upon every royal, indeed every &s;ubject heart:
<Q><L>Oh Axalla,</L>
<L>Could I forget I am a man as thou art,</L>
<L>Would not the winter's cold, or &s;ummer's heat,</L>
<L>Sickne&s;s, or thir&s;t and hunger, all the train</L>
<L>Of nature's clamorous appetites, a&s;&s;erting</L>
<L>An equal right in kings and common men,</L>
<L>Reprove me daily?&mdash;No, if I boa&s;t of ought,</L>
<L>Be it to have been heav'ns happy in&s;trument,</L>
<L>The means of good to all my fellow-creatures.</L>
<L>This is a king's be&s;t prai&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>Bajazet is here introduced, &s;welled with di&s;ap|pointment, rage, and horror. Upon the victor's mentioning that he has a right to demand attone|ment for the torrents of blood &s;hed by and through the Sultan's ambition, a reply of great &s;pirit is made, and even defiance hurled in the victorious monarch's face. Through the whole of this interview, Ta|merlane contra&s;ts a &s;pirit of philo&s;ophic dignity, to a kind of &s;avage fury; indeed maje&s;ty, in &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages, ca&s;ts a&s;ide every idea of royalty, to become ab&s;olutely &s;currilous: he rails, cur&s;es, &s;wears, and gives the lie mo&s;t gro&s;sly. The manner in which his life is given him, the a&s;&s;ignment of a royal tent for his accommodation, and the propo&s;ition of mode|rate terms, reflect great honour upon his humane, generous conqueror; while his churli&s;h refu&s;al of every favour &s;tamps him a brute.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="268">Tamerlane's remark of virtuous delicacy, which does not admini&s;ter benefits through mercenary hopes of reward, would have been much better if it had been expre&s;&s;ed without jingle. Upon the en|trance of Arpa&s;ia, Bajazet makes a fine picture&s;que a&s;&s;imilation of his own feelings, at &s;ight of the wo|man he loves, in &s;uch a fallen &s;tate. When Haly pre&s;ents her to him, he comments nervou&s;ly on her di&s;dainful looks, which &s;he returns with bitter re|proaches, for cau&s;ing the wrongs &s;he has &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The appearance of Mone&s;es kindles Bajazet's in|dignation, which ri&s;es higher on the Prince's pre|&s;uming to approach Arpa&s;ia. Being accu&s;ed by the Sultan of wanting courage and faith, he offers a &s;pi|rited vindication, which puts the tyrant pa&s;t all pa|tience, and cau&s;es him to hurry off in a frantic fit of pa&s;&s;ion, leaving the two lovers to a mournful inter|view; mournful, as Arpa&s;ia pathetically informs Mone&s;es, that in his ab&s;ence, though &s;he had con|fe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf his wife, yet Bajazet, deaf to tears and intreaties, had forced her into the ceremony and con&s;ummation of a marriage. This &s;cene is wrought up to a degree of melting tenderne&s;s, and the act concludes with an affecting &s;eparation.</P>
<P>It is a misfortune that the third act &s;hould begin with another love &s;cene, &s;o much inferior to that we have ju&s;t looked over. Axalla, as we find, has with painful &s;truggles, determined to yield up Seli|ma to her father: when the Emperor comes on, murmuring at the thoughts of obligations received, &s;he pre&s;ents her&s;elf, and for a moment he feels pater|nal &s;oftne&s;s; but, being told by the Prince that he mu&s;t receive her as a fre&s;h mark of Tamerlane's in|dulgence, the mon&s;ter of pride and ingratitude
<PB N="263" REF="269">
breaks out, and he goes near giving his benefactor that polite title given the electors of Middle&s;ex&mdash; <HI>&s;cum of the earth</HI>&mdash;When Selima &s;peaks favourably of Axalla, &s;he comes in for her &s;hare: the Prince a&s;&s;erts his own dignity in &s;o becoming a manner, that he puts the imperial &s;cold into a corner. Upon promi&s;ing to re&s;tore him his crown and empire, the &s;avage fixes Tamerlane's head as the only price that can purcha&s;e his daughter.</P>
<P>Seeing Axalla &s;hrink, like a man of honour and loyalty, from &s;o ba&s;e a propo&s;ition, he again puts on the bully, drags off Selima, and leaves Axalla without any comfort but that con&s;cious integrity which prevents even the &s;trong impul&s;e of ardent love, from making him undertake a ba&s;e action.</P>
<P>We next meet Mone&s;es, &s;oliciting an audience of Tamerlane; but being told by the Prince of Ta|nais that the Emperor is in private conference with a Dervi&s;e, he goes off to make way for the two la&s;t mentioned characters, who enter conferring on a religious &s;ubject. The prie&s;t, like a true &s;anguine bigot, rates Tamerlane for giving protection and countenance to Chri&s;tians. The narrowne&s;s of thought, the uncharitable, exclu&s;ive opinion of &s;ectari&s;ts, which devote to temporal and &s;piritual de&s;truction all who are not of their own cla&s;s, are &s;et in a light of ju&s;t contempt by the following very moral, argumentative, conclu&s;ive and beautiful lines:
<Q><L>&mdash;No law divine condemns the virtuous</L>
<L>For differing from the rules your &s;chools devi&s;e;</L>
<L>Look round how providence be&s;tows alike,</L>
<L>Sun&s;hine and rain, to ble&s;s the fruitful year,</L>
<L>On different nations all of different faiths;</L>
<L><PB N="264" REF="270">And though by different names and titles wor&s;hipp'd,</L>
<L>Heav'n takes the various tribute of their prai&s;e,</L>
<L>Since all agree to own, at lea&s;t to mean,</L>
<L>One great, one good, one only Lord of all.</L></Q></P>
<P>We are bold to a&s;&s;ert, that no pulpit ever ad|vanced a more u&s;eful, liberal piece of in&s;truction, which wi&s;ely con&s;iders human nature whether in the torrid, frigid, or temperate zone; whether of com|plexion black or white, brown or copper colour, as children of one univer&s;al, impartial parent.</P>
<P>Being foiled in all his arguments by the noble&s;t principles of rea&s;on and humanity, the hot-brained prie&s;t tries what a dagger will do, but is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re too prevented, by the magnanimous monarch who di&s;arms, and mercifully, we think too mercifully, di&s;mi&s;&s;es him without any other puni&s;hment than reproof. The holy A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in being departed, Mo|ne&s;es, oppre&s;&s;ed with griefs, pro&s;trates him&s;elf at the Emperor's feet, confe&s;&s;es the fal&s;hood he had been guilty of, in calling Arpa&s;ia his &s;i&s;ter, and &s;ollicits having her re&s;tored as his contracted bride. Tamerlane, knowing her to be Bajazet's queen, ju&s;tly declines any interpo&s;ition, and prudently re|commends the weaning his affection by martial ac|tivity, from the &s;oft bands of love to the thir&s;t of glory.</P>
<P>A very plea&s;ing, and poetical picture of the mind under the&s;e different influences clo&s;es the third act; the Dervi&s;e, who con&s;iders Tamerlane's clemency as folly, begins the fourth act, acquainting Haly that he has &s;truck out another &s;cheme for Bajazet's &s;ervice; by inflaming the di&s;content of Omar, a powerful chief, who having claimed Selima from
<PB N="265" REF="271">
the Emperor, is refu&s;ed on account of a preference given to Axalla.</P>
<P>By what Omar &s;ays at his entrance, we find, that he con&s;iders Tamerlane as under peculiar obligati|ons to him, and ungrateful in refu&s;ing his reque&s;t. The Dervi&s;e re&s;umes his inflammatory in&s;inuations, and Haly, mentioning that Selima may be had at her father's hands, the Tartar determines to join Bajazet's cau&s;e: hearing, by &s;ound of trumpet, the Emperor's approach, they retire.</P>
<P>A &s;ong, &s;uited to the di&s;tre&s;s of Arpa&s;ia, and much better written than &s;ongs in general, occurs here. The mu&s;ic ended, &s;he meditates on death, as a de&s;irable refuge from &s;orrow; but, as a Chri|&s;tian, nobly re&s;i&s;ts &s;ome great examples of &s;elf-de|&s;truction. Tamerlane, upon the humane principle of con&s;olation appears, and endeavours to balm the fair one's wounded mind. Bajazet entering while they are in conference, takes a jealous alarm, and bur&s;ts into fury like a &s;prung mine. His vulgarity in the fir&s;t &s;cene we have been &s;evere upon, but that we find in the &s;cene before us, no la&s;h of criti|ci&s;m is any way equal to.</P>
<P>After bearing more than is po&s;&s;ible to imagine, Tamerlane warms &s;o far into re&s;entment, that he de|livers Bajazet to the guards, and orders him to be executed: this, by Arpa&s;ia's interpo&s;ition, with the Emperor's lenity, is &s;et a&s;ide, and Tamerlane pru|dently retreats, le&s;t he &s;hould be kindled into rage again. What pity it is that Mr. ROWE has made him &s;peak a &s;ort of epilogue to every &s;cene.</P>
<P>The ira&s;cible Turk, who&s;e barbarous mind no weight of obligation can impre&s;s, goes off, &s;torming
<PB N="266" REF="272">
at Arpa&s;ia for having &s;aved his life; and di&s;claim|ing paradi&s;e, becau&s;e <HI>woman</HI> is placed there. This thought admits of an objection, if we con&s;ider the Mahometan opinion, that all the females of this life are, after death, annihilated; 'tis true, the prophet has furni&s;hed the future world with black-eyed girls, but we know not whether this ju&s;tifies Bajazet's extrava|gant idea. Arpa&s;ia, almo&s;t &s;unk with accumulating &s;orrows, &s;o much increa&s;ed by the tyrant's vile in&s;i|nuation of criminality with Tamerlane, is joined by Mone&s;es; their mutual plaints are extremely pa|thetic, the interchange of affection highly intere&s;t|ing, but the &s;cene concludes with two triplets which we can by no means approve; they are, if we may be allowed the &s;imilitude, like yellow fringe upon the border of a mourning gown.</P>
<P>Bajazet now comes forward, making large pro|mi&s;es to his new ally Omar, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance there are favourable appearances of his gaining ample re|venge upon Tamerlane. There is &s;omething odd here, that Axalla &s;hould be made and detained a pri&s;oner in his ma&s;ter's camp; however, he is brought on by Omar in that &s;tate. The Sultan propo&s;es to the prince, either joining with him or death; Axalla, with noble firmne&s;s, prefers the latter, which, but for Selima's &s;olicitation is re&s;olved on: at his daughter's reque&s;t, the Sultan defers his &s;entence, and Selima takes him off to try the power of her per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Affairs being thus &s;eemingly well di&s;po&s;ed for Bajazet's grand de&s;ign of recovering empire, he con|cludes the fourth act with a mo&s;t noble a&s;&s;imulation of him&s;elf to Jove engaged with the Titans. Ar|pa&s;ia, again in &s;oliloquy, commences the fifth act:
<PB N="267" REF="273">
we think there is a &s;amene&s;s in this lady's lonely meditations, which rather palls: &s;he informs us of what we already know, that Mone&s;es is made a pri|&s;oner. While &s;he is indulging gloomy thought, Bajazet enters, confe&s;&s;ing what influence &s;he has over his mind, even in the mid&s;t of mo&s;t important con|cerns; that even empire and revenge hold but the &s;econd place in his heart. He determines, either by gentle means or force, to take her with him; the former he tries in terms, for him, unu&s;ually &s;mooth; her di&s;dainful treatment of his &s;olicitation, again kindles up the flames of pa&s;&s;ion, and he threatens her with death; but &s;uppo&s;ing that the execution of Mone&s;es will wound deeper than the lo&s;s of her own life, he orders the unhappy prince to be &s;trangled in her &s;ight.</P>
<P>The parting of the&s;e lovers is particularly pathe|tic, though we think there is &s;omething very di&s;a|greeable in the mode of Mone&s;es's cata&s;trophe. Arpa&s;ia's end is not totally unnatural, but bears rather too hard upon probability; the word <HI>bla&s;t,</HI> twice u&s;ed in her la&s;t &s;peech, is much more becom|ing a lady of ea&s;y virtue than a tragedy heroine, however agitated: the confu&s;ion of Bajazet, at lo&s;ing the woman he loves &s;o &s;trangely, is interrupt|ed by the Dervi&s;e, who brings intelligence, that as there are apparent movements in the camp, it be|comes nece&s;&s;ary to ha&s;ten flight: &s;carce has he fi|ni&s;hed his me&s;&s;age, when Omar declares that they are &s;urrounded, and imputes the di&s;covery of their de|&s;igns to a pri&s;oner, who, by the Prince&s;s's order, was &s;uffered to e&s;cape. Bajazet, &s;truck with his daughter's treachery, re&s;olves to take revenge upon Axalla.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="274">Being told he was the per&s;on that had e&s;|caped, his fury rages again&s;t her, and he makes &s;e|veral attempts to kill her, but &s;ome feelings of the father prevent his fatal purpo&s;e; at length, hearing the approach of Tamerlane, he con&s;igns her fate to the mutes, from whom &s;he is re&s;cued by Axalla, while the tyrant is once more taken into cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>After &s;uch repeated and capital provocations, we are not to be &s;urprized that the Emperor's lenity gives way to his ju&s;tice; further forgivene&s;s would have been a pro&s;titution of mercy: the &s;entence he pa&s;&s;es upon Bajazet of being caged, is &s;everer than death, by &s;o much as pain of mind is more in&s;uffer|able than that of the body. The Sultan's departure is &s;trictly con&s;onant to his behaviour all through the piece, which concludes with a very noble remark upon that impious pride, which forgets the depen|dant &s;tate of human nature, and arrogates to it&s;elf the advantages and grandeur of life.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this play is merely u&s;ed as an anniver&s;ary one, yet, we think, when actors capable of &s;upporting it can be found, that it &s;hould &s;tand more forward in the rank of living tragedies. The incidents are various and affecting, the unities tole|rably well pre&s;erved, the &s;entiments elevated, and the language adequate without bomba&s;t. It is in &s;ome places rather too flowery, and the ver&s;ification &s;o flowing, &s;o &s;eldom broke, that it requires great judgment in &s;everal of the parts to avoid monotony.</P>
<P>Tamerlane is a character worth every monarch's imitation, active and intrepid as a &s;oldier; wi&s;e, ju&s;t and merciful, as a &s;overeign; affable, friendly, and benevolent, as a man: he reflects that credit upon his &s;tation, which no &s;tation nor dignity can give an
<PB N="269" REF="275">
unworthy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. No higher compliment could be paid King William than marking him out as the original of this plea&s;ing picture.</P>
<P>Mr. QUIN &s;upported Tamerlane with great dig|nity, but offended by his unnatural &s;well of utte|rance. Mr. HAVARD had all the e&s;&s;ential placidity, but wanted con&s;equence both of figure and deport|ment. Mr. SHERIDAN &s;hewed more propriety than either, as to expre&s;&s;ion, but in appearance and de|portment fell very &s;hort of the fir&s;t mentioned gen|tleman. We have &s;een Mr. SOWDON do the part re&s;pectably. The two pre&s;ent Tamerlanes are not worth mention, they want both internal and external requi&s;ites. Omar would do much better for Me&s;&s;rs. BENSLEY and AICKIN; the former of the&s;e gentle|men has been placed in &s;uch a variety of acting, though always the &s;ame, as was &s;carce ever known; fops, lovers, declaimers, tyrants. Who, but Mr. COLMAN, could have allotted Sir Brilliant Fa&s;hion and Barbaro&s;&s;a to the &s;ame performer? e&s;pecially one who has no variation.</P>
<P>Bajazet, though a hateful, and indeed vulgar cha|racter, always claims particular notice from an au|dience; there is a re&s;i&s;tive &s;pirit about him which gives plea&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding it is founded upon the wor&s;t principles. His pride, ambition, ingra|titude and cruelty, are dete&s;table, yet greatly coun|terballanced by his noble ideas of independance; he is the mo&s;t agreeable mon&s;ter we know, and very great powers are wanted to do the author ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Mr. QUIN, in the brutal part, excelled all the Bajazets we have &s;een, but had no part of the requi|&s;ite &s;pirit. Mr. BARRY, though better in the latter, had too much harmony of voice and feature to
<PB N="270" REF="276">
mark the former properly; for though a &s;oft &s;poken or fair looking man may be a brute, yet &s;uch being a deceptive character, does not fill our idea on the &s;tage. In the la&s;t &s;cene with Selima, Mr. BARRY's excellence &s;urpa&s;&s;es our prai&s;e. Mr. BERRY la|boured through the part abominably, and Mr. SMITH has made lamentable attempts upon it: for e&s;&s;ential fire, contemptuous a&s;pect, extent and varie|ty of voice, we place Mr. MOSSOP fir&s;t, at the &s;ame time that we allow Mr. HOLLAND great merit; as the chains and Turki&s;h habit rendered his mecha|nical movements le&s;s offen&s;ive than they were in modern cloaths.</P>
<P>Mone&s;es is di&s;tingui&s;hed by nothing but his love and misfortunes, which reduce him to a mo&s;t whin|ing &s;tate: he is generally given to &s;econd-rate actors, though he certainly was drawn for, and de&s;erves capital ones. We have had plea&s;ure from &s;eeing Mr. RYAN exhibit this prince, and pain from Mr. HULL. It hurries us beyond all patience, to think that any degree of managerical authority, whether ignorant or malicious, &s;hould force &s;o re&s;pectable a performer totally out of his way.</P>
<P>Mr. REDDISH is extremely plea&s;ing and characte|ri&s;tic; he neither ri&s;es above, nor falls below his au|thor, and has more merit than all the other men put together, as it is now played at Drury Lane: why does not Mr. ROSS do it at Covent Garden, where, without any great degree of eminence, he mu&s;t &s;tand foremo&s;t.</P>
<P>Axalla, we thought, could &s;carcely be wor&s;e than in the late Mr. PALMER's hands, but Mr. PACKER and Mr. PERRY, are &s;trong proofs of our mi&s;take; &s;uch a brace of heroic lovers&mdash;hoh! hoh! hoh!
<PB N="271" REF="277">
were &s;urely never &s;een before. Omar, when per|formed by Mr. SPARKS, made a very con&s;picuous figure; at pre&s;ent, he falls off con&s;iderably in the hands of Mr. HURST, though he is &s;econd be&s;t in the play, for we have &s;poken of Mr. BARRY in the Sultan as he <HI>was,</HI> not as he <HI>is.</HI> The remaining male characters are too incon&s;iderable for notice, being generally given to the tag-rag and bob-tail of a theatre.</P>
<P>Arpa&s;ia's painful &s;ituation touches &s;en&s;ibility; we &s;ympathize with her tears, while we are plea&s;ed with her &s;pirit and con&s;tancy. We could never admire Mrs. WOFFINGTON's croaking of this part; 'tis true, &s;he figured it &s;o elegantly, that her fir&s;t ap|pearance prejudiced &s;pectators in her favour; but harmony of per&s;on was greatly injured by di&s;&s;onance of voice. Mrs. PRITCHARD played the prince&s;s much better, but had not the nece&s;&s;ary &s;oftne&s;s. Mrs. BELLAMY had the proper degree of pathos, but whined. Mi&s;s MILLER has &s;tumbled upon the part mo&s;t injudiciou&s;ly; while Mrs. BARRY looks, moves, &s;peaks, and feels up to the highe&s;t degree of critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Selima is a mere foil to Arpa&s;ia, of very little con|&s;equence, and therefore very little attended to, yet we remember to have &s;een Mrs. ELMY give her un|common graces. Mrs. W. BARRY and Mrs. MAT|TOCKS are agreeable, but we beg leave to hint that the la&s;t mentioned lady has a &s;trong taint of the cathedral &s;tile.</P>
<P>We think the play of TAMERLANE has two con|&s;picuous faults; fir&s;t, the double love plot, which renders Axalla and Selima very unaffecting: next, the author's neglect of giving Ea&s;tern characters
<PB N="272" REF="278">
&s;omething of the Ea&s;tern &s;tile; this is a commenda|ble propriety which the author of Zingis has ad|hered to. The frequent execrations we meet are al&s;o cen&s;urable, nor can we forgive &s;o many repeti|tions of the word ALHA, the immediate title of the Supreme Being is not fit for &s;tage expre&s;&s;ion; how|ever, this tragedy, well performed, mu&s;t plea&s;e in repre&s;entation, and we cannot apprehend any pre|judice from peru&s;al of it: indeed, &s;ome &s;cenes are highly in&s;tructive, and worthy recollection of the mo&s;t &s;erious mind.</P>

<HEAD>ALL IN THE WRONG. A COMEDY: By Mr. MURPHY.</HEAD>
<P>SIR John Re&s;tle&s;s begins this play, reflecting on him&s;elf for taking to wife an improper per&s;on; and enquires of Robin which door &s;he went out, that towards the &s;treet, or one to the Park; being an|&s;wered through the latter, jealous &s;u&s;picions ari&s;e, which the dome&s;tic hone&s;tly and &s;en&s;ibly endeavours to remove from his ma&s;ter's mind; but, like a true &s;elf-tormenter, Sir John, though much in love with his lady, from which principle alone he married her, increa&s;es &s;hadows into &s;ub&s;tances, for the &s;trange purpo&s;e of working his own perplexity. Robert ob&s;erves, that this &s;trange mode of behaviour has tainted her lady&s;hip al&s;o with jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>The baronet, on hearing that &s;he bent her cour&s;e towards the Hor&s;e Guards, grows very warm; and &s;ending off Robin, goes him&s;elf, fraught with ideas of cuckoldom, in pur&s;uit of her. Belmont and Beverley meet; the purport of their conver&s;ation is a mutual confe&s;&s;ion of love, the former with Clari&s;&s;a, and the latter with Belinda. From what pa&s;&s;es, it appears, that Beverley has a temper &s;omewhat &s;imilar to Sir John's, which is rou&s;ed into a &s;tate of con&s;i|derable &s;olicitude, by mention that Belinda's father and Belmont's have determined upon uniting their children by marriage; however, to relieve his friend's pain, Belmont declares, that Clari&s;&s;a and he have agreed matters &s;o as to counteract the old gen|tlemen's
<PB N="274" REF="280">
de&s;igns. This gives Beverley great &s;atis|faction, and to increa&s;e his rapture Belinda appears, whom he addre&s;&s;es with much gallantry: he pre|&s;ents her his picture, which &s;he partly approves, but thinks a better painter might have been found, meaning Cupid, who forms the mo&s;t plea&s;ing im|pre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Clari&s;&s;a and Belmont, who indeed &s;ay nothing worth &s;taying on for, retire, and leave their friends to a tete-a-tete. Beverley &s;eems to think Belinda's inclination is not totally his, and from this idea he behaves to her in a &s;trange manner, for which &s;he properly reproves him; many trifling motives of irritation &s;tart up, and the conver&s;ation is a kind of &s;nip-&s;nap. At length, ju&s;tly irritated at his peevi&s;h &s;u&s;picions, &s;he retorts upon him emphatically, and he endeavours to repre&s;ent the whims of his unea&s;y, capricious mind, as delicacy. Lady Re&s;tle&s;s cro&s;|&s;ing the &s;tage interrupts them, and they go off with a promi&s;e from Belinda, that &s;he will let him into that lady's character. The baronet's perturbed con|&s;ort, upon not being immediately an&s;wered upon ringing at her own door, &s;uppo&s;es that &s;ome ba&s;e tran&s;actions are going forward in the hou&s;e, and &s;teps a&s;ide to watch.</P>
<P>Having heard the bell tattle, the chambermaid opens the door. Marmalet, a vi&s;itor, after &s;ome reflections upon their different &s;ervices, is going off; her lady&s;hip coming again to the door, and &s;eeing this &s;econd-hand gentlewoman neatly decked out, demands her bu&s;ine&s;s, intimating, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;es it has been with Sir John; the girl's natural con|fu&s;ion at &s;uch an imputation, &s;trengthens &s;u&s;picion. During Marmalet's vindication, ob&s;erving her to
<PB N="275" REF="281">
have a fre&s;h complexion, Lady Re&s;tle&s;s, &s;uppo&s;ing her to be painted, attempts rubbing off the unnatu|ral ornament: finding it real, &s;uch a complexion gives her fre&s;h unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;he orders the con|founded waiting-woman to come no more near her doors. Marmalet's going off rather petti&s;hly, helps to feed her jealou&s;y, as annexing &s;uch pertne&s;s to the idea of a mi&s;tre&s;s; and it grows to &s;uch a whim&s;ical pitch, that &s;he &s;uppo&s;es Sir John has given her the hand&s;ome gown &s;he wears. She then enquires for her &s;pou&s;e, and being told he is gone out, expo&s;es &s;till more her own weakne&s;s, by rating of Tattle, her maid.</P>
<P>Belinda and Beverley here enter, again re&s;uming the former &s;ubject; his uncertain temper, of which the lady &s;eems to have a very clear idea; therefore, brings him to expletive preliminaries, which he im|plicitly &s;ub&s;cribes to. Seeing Sir William and Blandford, &s;he hurries him off, and in three lines ob&s;erves, that though the old gentlemen are laying their heads together to counteract the &s;chemes of love, yet they mu&s;t be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>The fathers, in a few lines, expre&s;s what we have been previou&s;ly acquainted with, their mutual inten|tions concerning their children. Belinda being &s;poken to on the &s;ubject, mentions Beverley, as hav|ing been once encouraged by her father; but he ob&s;erving that he has changed his mind, perempto|rily in&s;i&s;ts upon her obeying the dictates of his will: this tyrannical ob&s;tinacy throws her into an over-powering di&s;tre&s;s of mind, &s;o that &s;he faints, ju&s;t as Sir John Re&s;tle&s;s comes on, and in her fainting drops Beverley's picture. While the baronet is engaged upon a principle of humanity in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="276" REF="282">
fair one, his turbulent con&s;ort &s;ees him from a win|dow, and mi&s;interprets his meaning into gallantry; upon his propo&s;ing to take Belinda into his hou&s;e, her lady&s;hip flies down to confront them.</P>
<P>The young lady chu&s;ing to go home, Sir John humanely and politely gives her per&s;onal conduct: Lady Re&s;tle&s;s entering upon their departure, is quite enraged that &s;he mi&s;&s;ed them, but picks up the picture Belinda dropped, and hopes from thence to make &s;ome di&s;covery.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, we meet Sir John enquiring of Robert for his lady; &s;eeing her approach with Tattle, he &s;teps a&s;ide, to hear, if po&s;|&s;ible, any thing con&s;onant to his &s;u&s;picions. When Lady Re&s;tle&s;s enters, &s;he blames Tattle for being in a con&s;piracy again&s;t her; then reflects upon the picture, which being that of a man, &s;he &s;uppo&s;es to be a former gallant of the unknown lady. At this point of time, while &s;he is railing again&s;t hu&s;bands, her lord and ma&s;ter peeps in; during &s;ome remarks &s;he makes upon the unequal re&s;trictions of men and women in the married &s;tate, he &s;wallows what &s;he &s;ays as a proof of infidelity. Tattle being ordered down &s;tairs, the jealous lady wi&s;hes &s;he had never &s;een her hu&s;band's face, which kind compliment he returns a&s;ide: &s;he contemplates the picture, admires its beauty, and feeling perfume puts it near her no&s;e, this Sir John takes for ki&s;&s;ing it. While &s;he goes on to compliment the portrait, wi&s;hing that &s;he had &s;uch a man, the baronet enters tip-toe, comes behind, looks over her &s;houlder, and &s;eems to approve her choice of a gallant: at length, his patience being quite ex|hau&s;ted, he &s;natches the bauble; a &s;quabble en&s;ues, wherein mutual mi&s;takes occur laughably; he
<PB N="777" REF="283">
charges her with guilt, and &s;he warmly recriminates upon him; he upbraids her with the picture, and &s;he him with the lady he was a&s;&s;i&s;ting, till the &s;cene ri&s;es into a degree of peculiar plea&s;antry: at la&s;t he goes off to find &s;ome proofs again&s;t her, and &s;he goes off to attain &s;ome again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Sir John re-enters &s;oon with Robert, de&s;iring him to look at the picture, and enquires if he can di&s;tin|gui&s;h who it is, in&s;i&s;ting at the &s;ame time that he can tell if he will, he tries every means to pump &s;ome intelligence out of him, but without a &s;ati&s;|factory an&s;wer. A Footman comes on and enquires for Sir John's; the Baronet a&s;ks his bu&s;ine&s;s, and takes a letter for Lady Re&s;tle&s;s from him; which upon peru&s;al appears to be written by Lord Con|que&s;t in his Lady's ab&s;ence, as an exculpation of the guilt with which Marmalet was charged in the fir&s;t act; and which, by the tenor of his Lord&s;hip's letter, has &s;ince been enforced by Lady Re&s;tle&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir John, &s;till in a &s;tate of egregious mi&s;take, in|terprets all this to his wife's di&s;honour, employs Robert to go and enquire for Mrs. Marmalet, and &s;eems more alarmed at being told &s;he vi&s;its Tattle; he appoints a meeting too with the waiting-wo|man in the Bird-Cage-Walk, and cautions Robert to extreme &s;ecrecy, de&s;iring at the &s;ame time that &s;he may meet him ma&s;ked. Matters thus &s;ettled, he goes to &s;earch for the original of that picture which he found in his wife's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Belmont and Beverley &s;ucceed the di&s;contented &s;prite conver&s;ing upon their amorous concerns; and it appears that Belmont's father, Sir William, has po&s;itively declared again&s;t his union with Cla|ri&s;&s;a; however he a&s;&s;ures Beverley of never interfer|ing
<PB N="278" REF="284">
with his mi&s;tre&s;s, Belinda; notwith&s;tanding which, that very odd mortal goes off in a &s;tile that we know not well whether he is plea&s;ed or di&s;plea&s;|ed. Sir John enters, and by the introduction of what's o'clock joins Belmont, in whom he can di&s;|cover no likene&s;s of the picture: Beverley re-enter|ing acco&s;ts Belmont, in phra&s;eology the author &s;eems fond of, my boy, dear rogue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sir John crui&s;es round for the purpo&s;e of di&s;covery, con|&s;iders Beverley very minutely, and draws conclu&s;i|ons of his being the original of that picture which has given him &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s. The behaviour of Sir John here has no doubt humour, but we think the author has &s;acrificed probable nature to catch at laughter. Belmont and Beverley being very ju&s;t|ly &s;urpri&s;ed at his behaviour, he thinks they laugh at him; indeed the exerci&s;e of a cane over his &s;houlders would better &s;uit his behaviour, but that he e&s;capes.</P>
<P>At length Beverley knowing the picture to be that he gave Belinda, catches jealous feelings, e&s;pe|cially as Sir John puts it ha&s;tily into his pocket, and upon being a&s;ked another &s;ight of it retires precipitately into his hou&s;e; this &s;ets the tinder-tempered lover into a blaze, as &s;uppo&s;ing his mi&s;|tre&s;s has given that taken of regard to another gallant; the act concludes with a &s;hort and unne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;oliloquy of Sir John's, intimating that he mu&s;t prove the identity of Beverley.</P>
<P>The two young ladies, Belinda and Clari&s;&s;a, meet us at the beginning of the third act, &s;till con|ver&s;ing upon their matrimonial projects; the latter &s;eems to he&s;itate at &s;ome re&s;olves &s;he has taken, while the former appears to laugh at her diffidence;
<PB N="279" REF="285">
the caprice of Beverley is mentioned again by Be|linda, who, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch a tickli&s;h temper, cannot avoid loving the man: Clari&s;&s;a very ju&s;tly remarks that there is &s;ome rea&s;on to doubt her friend's temper, being rather like the man's &s;he complains of; this Belinda denies, and Beverley is introduced to &s;peak for him&s;elf; after a few lines, Belmont a&s;ks for the picture, which &s;he cannot find, and charges one or other of them with having it, this nettles Beverley: Seeing the capricious lo|vers ready to &s;quabble again, Belmont and his mi&s;|tre&s;s very prudently retire from the approaching &s;torm.</P>
<P>When they are gone the agitated &s;wain upbraids his lady very &s;everely, for having given, as he &s;uppo&s;es, his picture to a more favoured gallant; his childi&s;h behaviour &s;he only laughs at, and indeed it de&s;erves no other treatment. She leaves him in a &s;tate of di&s;&s;atisfaction; but returns &s;oon with Clari&s;&s;a, they pa&s;s him by, &s;neer at his unea&s;ine&s;s, and thereby increa&s;e it much; in &s;oliloquy he ex|pre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with vehemence, and determining to know the bottom of the matter he re&s;olves, when they are out of &s;ight, to vi&s;it Sir John, who&s;e hou&s;e he knows by having &s;een him go into it.</P>
<P>Lady Re&s;tle&s;s meeting Robert with &s;ome cloaths over his own, &s;tops him to &s;earch the pockets for letters; not finding any, &s;he renews her former ac|cu&s;ation again&s;t the &s;ervant, that he is her enemy and in combination with his ma&s;ter; hearing a rap at the door &s;he li&s;tens, and, Tattle coming on, en|quires who is at the door, then upbraids her for going out without leave; on being informed that &s;he went to bring Marmalet for their mutual ju&s;ti|fication,
<PB N="280" REF="286">
this is con&s;trued into a fre&s;h crime by her Lady&s;hip, and &s;he re&s;olves upon vi&s;iting Lady Con|que&s;t, having had no an&s;wer to her letter; Tattle, true to her name and &s;tation, throws out a &s;uppo&s;i|tion which gratifies Lady Re&s;tle&s;s's &s;u&s;picions, by telling that Robert was at Lord Conque&s;t's, de&s;i|ring Marmalet to meet his ma&s;ter in the evening.</P>
<P>While the wretched wife is enjoying this piece of information, a &s;ervant acquaints her that a gentle|man below wants to &s;peak to Sir John about a pic|ture; hoping &s;ome di&s;covery from this interview, &s;he orders him to be &s;hewn up &s;tairs; Tattle's in|telligence, which &s;he &s;eems willing to enrich with all the ornaments of &s;candal, is interrupted by Be|verley's approach. After mutual &s;alutation they enter upon the &s;ubject of his vi&s;it, when they plant thorns in each other's brea&s;t by a chain of mi&s;in|terpretations; he looks upon it as certain that Belinda gave Sir John the picture, and to confirm the matter her Lady&s;hip feelingly de&s;cribes the &s;i|tuation &s;he &s;aw them in during the fainting fit; adding, that &s;he believes her hu&s;band capable of any vile action.</P>
<P>This &s;cene is admirably well wrought up, as the confu&s;ion of mi&s;takes ari&s;e from very probable ap|pearances, and the characters part under conviction that their fears have been well founded. The &s;cene changing to the Park, Sir John enters before his own hou&s;e, fully per&s;uaded that he has di&s;co|vered his wife's paramour; ju&s;t at this in&s;tant he &s;ees Beverley coming from his hou&s;e, and giving Robert a gratification for his trouble; when the jealous lover perceives the jealous hu&s;band, he ac|co&s;ts him with a degree of peevi&s;hne&s;s which is an|&s;wered
<PB N="281" REF="287">
in the &s;ame &s;tile: Here recrimination plea|&s;antly en&s;ues, and the puzzle of circum&s;tances is kept up in a plea&s;ing manner; each catches eagerly at what flatters his own opinion, while jealou&s;y gives applau&s;e that &s;he makes them &s;uch ridiculous fools.</P>
<P>Stung to the quick, when Sir John leaves him, Beverley declares that he will have one interview with his fal&s;e mi&s;tre&s;s to vent his mind, and then, however painful it may be, renounce her for ever; here &s;he enters with Belmont, and Clari&s;&s;a, who are the mo&s;t commode polite companions we know; for they come on without any bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ay little, help to make out a laugh, and complai&s;antly leave their friends to battle as long as they like.</P>
<P>Belinda &s;eems inclined to coquette it with her gallant, but neither her &s;miles, nor &s;allies of wit, can clear the wintry gloom of Beverley's brow; it &s;cowls heavily upon her till the &s;torm bur&s;ts in his pronouncing an everla&s;ting farewel: At length, after con&s;iderable acrimony on both &s;ides, by his men|tioning the circum&s;tance of her being &s;een in the arms of a gentleman, &s;hews her his mi&s;take, which, from a &s;pirit of re&s;entment, &s;he determines to im|prove for the &s;ake of additional mortification.</P>
<P>His declaration of love, and the regard he has for her future happine&s;s, notwith&s;tanding the ba&s;e|ne&s;s he thinks her guilty of, are marks of an inge|nuous and delicate mind; however, &s;he properly triumphs and keeps him on the fret till he almo&s;t becomes an object of pity; his a&s;&s;everations of ne|ver approaching her again are carried too far; in|deed the &s;cene wants curtailing, for it harps too long upon one &s;tring. Belinda concludes the third act with placing jealous lovers in the light DRYDEN
<PB N="282" REF="288">
has done great wits, that it is within the pale of madne&s;s or ju&s;t on the edge of it.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act he &s;eems to verify her remark by meditating in a manner almo&s;t frantic, and upon receiving, by the hands of his &s;ervant, a letter from her, the delirium ri&s;es; our author has here given a fine &s;cope for acting merit, but it is not ea&s;ily hit off: The in&s;eparable pair, Clari&s;&s;a and Belmont, come on while he is in a painful reverie, they rou&s;e him, and recommend a reconciliation with a woman they think he cannot help loving; he remains ob&s;tinate, yet drops &s;everal ex|pre&s;&s;ions which plainly indicate that his heart bends that way; the circum&s;tance of her fainting fit, which gave ri&s;e to Lady Re&s;tle&s;s's &s;trange narration being explained to him, he is &s;hocked at the idea of his own brutal behaviour, and fears to approach the injured fair, but by the encouragement of friends re|&s;olves to attempt the reconciliation he &s;o much wi&s;hes: The plea&s;ing di&s;covery of Belinda's inno|cence tran&s;ports her lover into almo&s;t as extravagant joy as her imaginary fal&s;hood gave him pain, he goes off, and his dove-like friends follow.</P>
<P>Belinda mourning her lover's unaccountable tem|per appears next, enquiring of Tippet whether any me&s;&s;age is come from him: Sir John enters, when by Belinda's charging his Lady with having weaned Beverley's affection from her, Sir John opens a fre&s;h field of perplexity, by accu&s;ing Beverley with a de|&s;ign upon his wife; Belinda's regard makes her he|&s;itate for &s;ome time, but on being a&s;&s;ured by the Baronet that what he has &s;aid may be relied on, &s;he in her turn re&s;olves to di&s;claim him.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="289">Sir John, &s;oon after leaving her, appears in the Park, in expectation of Marmalet; a woman comes on ma&s;ked, who, confe&s;&s;ing great fear, begs ad|mittance to his hou&s;e; knowing that Lady Re&s;tle&s;s is not at home he admits her, and orders that they may be private. We next meet Tattle acquaint|ing Beverley with the mi&s;chief his picture had occa|&s;ioned; he wants to &s;ee Sir John for &s;ake of expla|nation, but &s;he advi&s;es him not to &s;tay on any ac|count, however the argument is ended by her &s;ee|ing the Baronet conducting a woman in a ma&s;k. Beverley's &s;u&s;picion takes alarm, and for the &s;ake of di&s;covery he con&s;ents to be put into a clo&s;et where he may overhear.</P>
<P>By the by, this li&s;tening is a mo&s;t ungentleman-like action, the worthle&s;s fruit of a mean, &s;u&s;pici|ous heart. Sir John leads forward his Ma&s;k, which proves to be no other than his own crooked rib; having gone &s;omething too far while he &s;up|po&s;ed her Marmalet, he tries what &s;oothing will do, but &s;he remains inexorable, and going for pen and ink, as re&s;olving to give her brother an ac|count of the di&s;agreeable &s;ituation &s;he is in, &s;he finds the clo&s;et where Beverley lies concealed locked; this proves fre&s;h cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, and being laughed at by Sir John &s;he grows more impatient. The Maid is thrown into confu&s;ion and pretends to know nothing of the key, but being forced to pro|duce it, throws it on the ground and runs away.</P>
<P>On perceiving a man, her Lady&s;hip &s;creams out, and Sir John, at Beverley's unaccountable appear|ance, revives his jealou&s;y; Beverley endeavours to apologize, but cannot obtain a hearing; he is be&s;et both by Sir John and the Lady, who&s;e mutual at|tacks
<PB N="284" REF="290">
place him in a very di&s;agreeable &s;ituation; at length Beverley threatening a duel if his picture is not returned, the Baronet's courage fails him, and he gives it up; after which the young gentleman retires with a declaration, that when rea&s;on can be heard he &s;hall be ready to convince them of their error. Sir John, glowing with &s;u&s;picion, renews the verbal war with her Lady&s;hip, in which, like a true female, &s;he maintains her part ably; threats and reproaches of an angry nature are vented reci|procally, and they conclude the fourth act with very virulent terms.</P>
<P>Blandford, Sir William, and Belmont, meet us, the former ob&s;erving that all matters relative to the marriage are &s;ettled, goes to call his daughter Be|linda. From an intermediate conference between Sir William and his &s;on, the latter di&s;covers an in|clination to evade the match his father has provided for him, and pleads the lady's aver&s;ion to it; the old fellow grows warm and in&s;i&s;ts upon the point, which obliges Belmont to &s;ay, if the Lady is wil|ling he &s;hall be ready; but this conde&s;cen&s;ion he only makes from an a&s;&s;urance that &s;he will never be brought to compliance; however in this he &s;eems greatly di&s;appointed, for Blandford comes on pro|claiming with joy his daughter's readine&s;s to obey; &s;he formally declares her &s;entiments to the utter confu&s;ion of Belmont, the fathers go off to take a cheering gla&s;s and invite him to participate, after a &s;ingle que&s;tion to Belinda he follows them.</P>
<P>She in a &s;hort &s;oliquy declares that her determi|nation is &s;erious, but Clari&s;&s;a's claim to Belmont &s;triking upon her mind cau&s;es &s;ome impediment; to her maid Tippet &s;he vents her &s;pleen again&s;t Be|verley,
<PB N="285" REF="291">
de&s;iring that all his letters, and a bracelet, may be returned, claiming her's in exchange; &s;he gives one al&s;o to inform him that his fal&s;hood has forced her into a compliance with the match her fa|ther has propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding part of this &s;cene &s;hews Belinda in a very natural plea&s;ant view of love-&s;ick agitati|on; ju&s;t as &s;he is entering into the mo&s;t &s;olemn re|&s;olutions never to &s;ee his face again, a &s;ervant ac|quaints her that Beverley reque&s;ts admittance, &s;he orders him to be &s;hewn up, and bids Tippet retire. Her gallant at his entrance pleads pardon for his mi&s;conduct, which &s;he peremptorily denies, he &s;oli|cits her acceptance of the picture recovered from Sir John, but &s;he a&s;&s;erts it is come from Lady Re&s;t|le&s;s; when &s;he mentions her marriage with Belmont, his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;upplication changes to very &s;e|vere retorts, which work her into tears, and drive her off with a farewel for ever.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort &s;cene with Tippet he &s;hews what fa&s;t hold &s;he has of his heart, and goes off to find means of clearing matters; &s;he returns, and having the &s;ame feelings for him which he has for her, is per&s;uaded by the waiting-woman to &s;eek an expla|nation from Lady Re&s;tle&s;s, for which purpo&s;e &s;he orders a chair. Belmont enters and blames her for cau&s;ing him &s;uch perplexity, &s;he pleads Beverley's fal&s;hood. The gentle Clari&s;&s;a appears, much warm|ed with a &s;uppo&s;ition that has been much im|po&s;ed on by Belmont and Belinda; when the la&s;t mentioned lady goes off, Belmont wants to per&s;uade Clari&s;&s;a that &s;he mi&s;conceives matters, but intima|ting that her behaviour &s;eems the effect of jealou&s;y, her pride is hurt, and &s;he leaves him abruptly, de|claring
<PB N="286" REF="292">
that Belinda &s;hall have her thoughts upon paper.</P>
<P>Sir William enters to his &s;on, declaring all is now ready for con&s;ummation: Belmont, by way of gaining time, gives a material rea&s;on for declining the match, no le&s;s than the lady's having a blemi&s;h|ed reputation; this alarms the old baronet. Bland|ford, full of the wedding, comes enquiring for his daughter; being informed that &s;he is gone to Sir John Re&s;tle&s;s's, he entertains &s;ome fear, and this circum&s;tance corroborates Belmont's in&s;inuation to his father; they all go off in pur&s;uit of her. Tattle conducts Beverley in; a few &s;peeches pa&s;s between him and Lady Re&s;tle&s;s, when Sir John ru&s;hes in with fre&s;h complaint: Beverley attempts to di&s;cu&s;s the point calmly, when Belinda enters, which occa&s;ions a very laughable jumble of jealou&s;y. While their pa&s;&s;ions are in the full tide of recrimination, Bland|ford and Sir William appear, Lady Re&s;tle&s;s main|tains perplexity, by charging Belinda with making her mi&s;erable. Belmont and Clari&s;&s;a appear: Sir William, confirmed by what he hears of Belinda's blemi&s;hed reputation, de&s;ires his &s;on to take the la|dy of his choice. This occa&s;ions &s;ome rubs between the old gentlemen, and Blandford declares again&s;t any connexion with tho&s;e who could &s;light his daughter.</P>
<P>Clari&s;&s;a, without any point being cleared up, patient|ly &s;uffers Belmont to take her hand. Belinda is offer|ed to Beverley by her father; Lady Re&s;tle&s;s &s;ays, if he will marry the object of her jealou&s;y, &s;he will be &s;a|tisfied; and Sir John &s;ays, that Belinda's con&s;ent will quiet his mind. This brings matters to an expla|nation, with regard to the picture; but Sir John
<PB N="287" REF="293">
and his lady laying fre&s;h charges again&s;t each other, he goes off to bring on conviction, and &s;he follows to prevent his having a private conference with his confidante Robert.</P>
<P>All the characters go off, and leave Belinda and Beverly to make up their bickerings in a tender, natural, agreeable manner. The other characters &s;oon return, when it appears, that Sir John and his lady, by what conviction we know not, are &s;atisfied; the union of Belinda and Beverly is agreeably con|firmed by Blandford's in&s;i&s;ting upon it; the piece concludes with mutual a&s;&s;urances of regulating tem|per better for the future; the lady's concluding rhimes we dont admire.</P>
<P>Never did critici&s;m toil through &s;uch a pantomi|mical jumble of incidents as this comedy, e&s;pecially in the la&s;t act; and there is &s;uch a &s;imilarity in mo&s;t of the &s;cenes, that we have been extremely puzzled to find words for the account of them, without &s;ay|ing the &s;ame thing over and over again.</P>
<P>Time and place are very well pre&s;erved, but the plot is unpardonably intricate, and not &s;ufficiently elucidated at the cata&s;trophe; the four leading cha|racters are exactly alike, &s;ave two being married and two &s;ingle. From a natural impetuo&s;ity in Mr. YATES's temper, and his knowledge of the &s;tage, great expectations might have been formed from his exhibition of the precipitate, weak, chimerical Sir John Re&s;tle&s;s, who catches at the &s;hadow of of|fence, and entirely &s;ets a&s;ide the rea&s;onable inve&s;ti|gation of the circum&s;tances which pain his mind; not one critical idea could be formed but he ful|filled to a very particular degree of &s;atisfaction; and we are &s;urprized how Mr. KING has brought
<PB N="288" REF="294">
him&s;elf to &s;uch an exact equilibre with the original: without borrowing from his predece&s;&s;or any thing, he equally gains and plea&s;es our attention; we can|not point out any precedence that &s;hould take place between the&s;e two gentlemen in this play; if any preference mu&s;t be given, the la&s;t mentioned per|haps may claim it, as having a more plea&s;ing, though not a more cha&s;te utterance.</P>
<P>Beverley is a &s;tranger object for a batchelor, than Sir John is for a hu&s;band, captious, fretful, and &s;u&s;picious to an intolerable degree, &s;o much that we think Belinda's &s;uffering &s;uch repetition of his in&s;o|lent airs, and uniting with him at la&s;t, is an impeach|ment of her under&s;tanding; love we know works unaccountable effects, but we think the jealou&s;y of this play &s;o &s;trained and improbable, that to us it &s;eems carried to the la&s;t degree of folly.</P>
<P>The gentleman who fir&s;t appeared in this amo|rous Quixote being retired from theatrical connec|tions we are not at liberty to name him, but mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert that his merit was inimitable; Mr. CAUTHER|LEY, oh la! oh la! oh la! only &s;erves to pain re|membrance with a di&s;mal contra&s;t to what we have &s;een. Belmont is &s;uch an in&s;ipid daudle, it would be cruel to expect any thing from an actor in the repre&s;entation of him; no body need wi&s;h to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s Mr. PACKER of him, and whoever does will not, we imagine, have more merit; Sir Willi|am Belmont and Blandford being equally in&s;ignifi|cant may repo&s;e quietly enough in the &s;omniferous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Me&s;&s;rs. BRANSBY and BURTON, as came a pair as e'er made audience nod.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="295">The character of Lady Re&s;tle&s;s is exactly &s;imi|lar to that of her hu&s;band, a childi&s;h &s;hadow-hun|ter, a perplexing termagant, fond of mi&s;ery, and con&s;tantly in pur&s;uit of it: Mi&s;s HOUGHTON, not|with&s;tanding a li&s;p, and the Newca&s;tle mode of pronouncing the letter R, had a very particular merit in this turbulent Lady; yet we have great rea|&s;on to be &s;urprized why Mrs. PRITCHARD was not the original, who&s;e acting in the JEALOUS WIFE gave &s;uch ju&s;t and general &s;atisfaction; at pre&s;ent the parts is &s;upplied by Mrs. HOPKINS with more ability than &s;he &s;hews in mo&s;t of her undertak|ings.</P>
<P>Belinda is very like, though not quite &s;o great an oddity as her lover; how Mrs. YATES could be appointed her repre&s;entative is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, as &s;he never had, nor never will have, any degree of comic expre&s;&s;ion: Mrs. ABINGTON goes infinitely beyond her, and &s;eems to fill up the author's inten|tion perfectly. Clari&s;&s;a is too in&s;ipid for any ac|tre&s;s to make a figure in, &s;he impaired the real me|rit of Mrs. PALMER, and lies heavy on Mrs. W. BARRY.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we mu&s;t condemn that hurry of incidents, and that &s;amene&s;s of character which we find in this piece; nor do we perceive any very obvious moral; the dialogue is ea&s;y and &s;pirited, but not enriched with &s;entiment; it is almo&s;t entirely a kind of peevi&s;h chit-chat: This comedy, had there not been one previou&s;ly called &s;o, &s;hould have been named the PICTURE, for that is the axis on which it turns; this brings to mind a remark of Mr. QUIN's, at a con&s;ultation, what name to give the

<HEAD>BARBAROSSA. A TRAGEDY: By Dr. BROWN.</HEAD>
<P>OTHMAN, an officer belonging to Barbaro&s;&s;a's court, and a &s;lave, open this piece: the former, being told that a &s;tranger reque&s;ts admittance, after a pretty account of the unknown per&s;on, de&s;ires him to be conducted in. Upon Sadi's entrance, Othman approaches to embrace, and give him the mo&s;t cordial &s;alutation, which he declines in angry terms: from what en&s;ues, it appears, that this ho|ne&s;t Algerine, filled with indignation again&s;t Barba|ro&s;&s;a, as murderer of their late good king, con&s;iders Othman, from his place and habiliments, as an a|bettor of the u&s;urper. His zeal, for &s;ome time, is deaf to rea&s;on; but, when Othman mentions that his &s;tay at court was in pity to the Queen, and to watch &s;ome favourable opportunity of ju&s;t revenge upon the tyrant, Sadi &s;oftens. A melting picture is given of the oppre&s;&s;ion Algiers labours under, and the &s;ad &s;ituation Zaphira is in from the murder of her hu&s;band, the exile of her &s;on, and being tor|mented with the amorous &s;olicitation of him who has been the cau&s;e of all her woes.</P>
<P>Othman ob&s;erving that a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins are di&s;patched to find and de&s;troy Selim, Sadi's impatience again breaks out, but is moderated by his cooler and more politic friend, who advi&s;es him to leave the court, which advice, hearing trumpets proclaim the ap|proach of Barbaro&s;&s;a, he takes. The tyrant, on his
<PB N="292" REF="298">
entrance, a&s;ks concerning the execution of five per|&s;ons, &s;acrificed for what he him&s;elf had been guilty of, and delivers him&s;elf in the haughtie&s;t terms of ambitious pride. Ob&s;erving a pen&s;ive ca&s;t in Oth|man's countenance, he demands the meaning of it; then mentions his &s;urprize that young Selim &s;hould be a voluntary exile, when he might find protection from him.</P>
<P>Aladin here brings intelligence that Selim is no more, the circum&s;tance &s;trikes Othman &s;o that Bar|baro&s;&s;a perceives it; however, he gives it a favour|able turn. The Prince thus di&s;po&s;ed of, another care takes up the u&s;urper's thoughts, how to prevail on Zaphira: for this he a&s;ks the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Oth|man, with promi&s;es of great reward if he &s;ucceeds, and bids him go before the account of her &s;on's death has gloomed her temper. His &s;uppo&s;ed friend being gone, he indulges his &s;atisfaction at Selim's fate, and confers with Aladin, a very proper agent of barbarity, de&s;iring him to &s;pread a report that the widowed Queen has at length con&s;ented to become his wife.</P>
<P>As he is going to vi&s;it her, his daughter Irene meets him; perceiving her in tears, he checks the untimely &s;orrow &s;he wears. She comes, as it ap|pears, a &s;uppliant from the Queen, to beg he wont per&s;i&s;t in his command to &s;ee her; this &s;he urges very tenderly: when he &s;peaks of Selim's death, her tears flow afre&s;h. This enflames him, and he demands the cau&s;e, which appears to be gratitude for his having ran&s;omed her from a &s;tate of capti|vity: in&s;tead of applauding her delicate &s;en&s;ibility, Barbaro&s;&s;a is enraged that &s;he &s;hould have received freedom from his foe, and goes off, commanding
<PB N="293" REF="299">
her not to acquaint the Queen, whom he re&s;olves to po&s;&s;e&s;s, with Selim's fate.</P>
<P>Irene, &s;truck with her father's &s;tern, obdurate re|&s;olves, declares her intention of aiding Zaphira's e&s;|cape, the fir&s;t favourable opportunity. The hu|mane attachment of this prince&s;s to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed inno|cence is very amiable, and gives a mo&s;t favourable impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, we meet Za|phira, bewailing her haple&s;s lot, bereft both of hu&s;band and child, and en&s;laved by their de&s;troyer. Upon Othman's appearance &s;he mentions her &s;on's fate; being told that Barbaro&s;&s;a a&s;&s;umes the name of king, and means to &s;ee her, &s;he execrates the mon&s;ter, and ardently wi&s;hes &s;ome means of e&s;cape, but as there is a &s;trict watch kept Othman deems that impo&s;&s;ible; therefore, recommends external acquie&s;cence, as the only method of gaining that li|berty which may make her e&s;cape practicable: however hard to put on di&s;&s;imulation in her ca&s;e, however painful to a mourning wife and mother, &s;he, after many &s;truggles, to work the means of re|venge, promi&s;es that her friend's advice &s;hall be pur|&s;ued. Barbaro&s;&s;a approaches, with &s;oftened looks and amorous &s;alutation, which &s;he evades, by ob|&s;erving, that her heart cannot be weaned from the fir&s;t object of its regard, that &s;he could not return his affection, and begs, if he really loves, a proof of it, by giving her liberty to &s;eek her father.</P>
<P>The u&s;urper endeavours to per&s;uade, by drawing a pompous compari&s;on between his own powerful grandeur, and the un&s;ettled ob&s;curity of that &s;tate which &s;he wi&s;hes to be in: dead to all joys and &s;plendor, &s;he per&s;everes &s;o far in her reque&s;t, as to
<PB N="294" REF="300">
kneel at his feet. This moves Barbaro&s;&s;a to re|proach, which &s;he returns with great bitterne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion: when, as a &s;troke of art, he offers to en|throne her &s;on if &s;he will marry him, her pa&s;&s;ion ri&s;es to its utmo&s;t pitch, and &s;he pours cur&s;es on him. Finding &s;he has been informed of what he meant to keep from her knowledge, he &s;ays the re|port is not true; however, &s;eeing through and de|te&s;ting his de&s;igns, &s;he peremptorily declares again&s;t his &s;uit; this draws threats from Barbaro&s;&s;a, which &s;he replies to with &s;pirited dignity.</P>
<P>Thus baffled, the tyrant &s;oliloquizes in great per|turbation, during which Aladin enters, to whom he tells his di&s;appointment and di&s;traction; to calm which, the convenient tool of royalty acquaints him, that the murderer of Selim is arrived: he imme|diately de&s;ires to &s;ee him, and Selim, under the title of Achmet, is introduced. Upon receiving a ring from the &s;uppo&s;ed &s;lave, Barbaro&s;&s;a, after giving him freedom, enquires how the affair was tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>His curio&s;ity being gratified, he promi&s;es Ach|met con&s;iderable reward, bids him go to the Queen, and tell her that Selim, with his dying breath, re|que&s;ted to heal the wounds of his country, that &s;he would &s;hare Barbaro&s;&s;a's bed and throne: he al&s;o recommends the &s;tranger to Othman's care, and goes off with Aladin to a banquet.</P>
<P>An anxiety of thought, perceptible in Othman, occa&s;ions Selim to enquire the cau&s;e of it, but he obtains no di&s;tinct an&s;wer: the loyal Algerine, fired with indignation, not only at his lawful prince's death, but having the murderer before him, throws off his a&s;&s;umed allegiance to Barbaro&s;&s;a, and lays his hatred open; this, we think, very in|con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="295" REF="301">
con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;cheme of policy he has laid down for a&s;&s;i&s;ting Zaphira; however, it gives him an op|portunity of declaring his friendly &s;entiments re|&s;pecting the Prince, who, with gradual caution at length reveals him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t dramatic di&s;coveries, of this nature, are ei|ther trifling or improbable; Selim's we take to have a touch of both: for though Othman &s;ays no time can blot out the remembrance of his lu&s;trous eye and graceful features, yet he cannot recollect him without adverting to a &s;car, which the poet has ve|ry unaccountably called beauteous; had he been an Iri&s;h author, this would have been named a bull. Well, this ornamental &s;car is produced, at which Othman very properly exclaims, Am I awake! and recognizes the Prince immediately; nay, &s;ees every lineament of his father's face in his countenance. Selim mentions the manner of getting Barbaro&s;&s;a's ring, by which he has pa&s;&s;ed un&s;u&s;pected; he a&s;ks tenderly for his mother, and mentions the tyrant's order for &s;eeing her; but Othman, fearful of di&s;|covery, wi&s;hes him to quit the court.</P>
<P>Secure in his di&s;gui&s;e, he determines to &s;tay and watch a fit opportunity of revenging his father's blood; that his de&s;ign may not appear romantic, he &s;peaks of having &s;een Sadi and Almanzor, who, with a cho&s;en band of citizens, have promi&s;ed to &s;torm Barbaro&s;&s;a's palace. Othman gives precau|tionary advice, and Selim concludes the &s;econd act with an intere&s;ting and very &s;pirited &s;upplication to his father's &s;hade.</P>
<P>Irene, notwith&s;tanding her father's har&s;h com|mands, holds Selim in tender regard; and knowing him through his di&s;gui&s;e, expre&s;&s;es, at the beginning
<PB N="296" REF="302">
of the third act, anxious concern for his &s;afety. He enters, and endeavours to avoid her, but &s;he avows knowledge of him, and with great genero&s;ity of &s;pirit, warns him from the court, taking on her&s;elf the ta&s;k to tell the Queen he lives. When he men|tions revenge, as a main motive of his &s;taying in the palace, her filial affection is alarmed, and &s;he utters &s;trong apprehen&s;ions for her father. He urges Bar|baro&s;&s;a's guilt, &s;he pleads her&s;elf his daughter, and again tenderly urges his departure, which he &s;eems to acquie&s;ce in, if allowed an interview with his mo|ther. She retires, and leaves him to view his peri|lous &s;ituation, which he does with very becoming fortitude; then reque&s;ts from an attendant &s;lave audience of the Queen.</P>
<P>Zaphira appears, who, as well as Othman, has &s;trangely forgot the features of her darling &s;on: &s;he enquires re&s;pecting Selim's fate, he tells her that he was witne&s;s of it, and literally fulfils Barbaro&s;&s;a's commands re&s;pecting Selim's la&s;t reque&s;t: Zaphira fires with indignation at &s;uch an in&s;ult to her &s;on's me|mory; &s;eeing and pitying her agitation, he changes his tone, and gives her a glimmering of hope that the prince is &s;till alive; &s;ays he was his companion in exile, and &s;pread the &s;tory of his death to gain an interview with her, he bids her maintain her re&s;olution with becoming confidence, till a &s;troke can be &s;truck for her delivery, and &s;ends her off in a &s;tate of much greater comfort than he met her.</P>
<P>Being alone he indulges that grief which in her pre&s;ence he was obliged to &s;mother; when Othman and Sadi appear, he a&s;ks how the night wears, which they inform him approaches the mid-hour; he communicates the purport of his interview with
<PB N="297" REF="303">
the Queen, and is told his friends in the city burn for the hour of action; mentioning that Irene knew him, his friends pre&s;s immediate departure, but he determines to be near for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a mother, threatened with violation. He de&s;ires, upon hearing how matters are concerted, that the tyrant may be left for his particular vengeance; Othman reminds him of Irene, but with noble firmne&s;s he declares him&s;elf above the influence of love in &s;uch a cau&s;e. When the midnight watch warns them to part, Selim gives a humane charge to &s;hed none but guilty blood; the Prince, in &s;oli|loquy, ruminates upon the awful circum&s;tances de|pending; he examines his heart, and emphatically apologizes for working by underhand means, that re|venge which he could wi&s;h to obtain by open and honourable war. The author has laboured, and not un&s;ucce&s;sfully, to make this &s;cene a &s;olemn pre|paration for the great event that is in agitation; the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, the murmuring &s;urge, the moon ri&s;ing in blood, all call attention, to the wi&s;hed for point.</P>
<P>Irene begins the fourth act with Aladin; it ap|pears, that terrified by an ominous dream, &s;he has de&s;ired to &s;ee her father, who comes on in a very churli&s;h mood at being di&s;turbed during his ban|quet; &s;he expre&s;&s;es her apprehen&s;ion of lurking danger, and relates her dream with &s;trong colour|ing, which Barbaro&s;&s;a treats with contempt.</P>
<P>Aladin comes on, and informs him, that a ru|mour prevails of young Selim's being alive, and in the city; though loth to admit fear, he orders the watch to be doubled, and commands Achmet to be brought before him; this alarms Irene, who
<PB N="298" REF="304">
begs hard that he may not &s;ee Achmet, but the u&s;urper will have his way, and drives her off the &s;tage in a &s;tate of painful perplexity; being alone, con&s;cious guilt ri&s;es to his view, and &s;eems to &s;tagger his re&s;olution; but knowing in his &s;ituation, the danger of remor&s;e, he re&s;olves to &s;uppre&s;s the feel|ings of con&s;cience. He demands of Selim, if he be really what he has repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>This unexpected que&s;tion rather confounds the prince; Barbaro&s;&s;a, with violent threats, a&s;ks if Selim is not alive; Selim, with a dagger's point at his brea&s;t, evades fate, by braving it; how|ever, the u&s;urper commands he may be &s;trictly watched, then orders the marriage writes, vowing, that Zaphira &s;hall, during the current night, be joined to him in wedlock; &s;he comes on and is que&s;tioned, whether her heart has relented, by per|&s;i&s;ting in refu&s;al, &s;he enflames him &s;o that he calls his guards to drag her to the altar; whether Maho|metans have any altars we are not entirely clear; the&s;e compul&s;ive mea&s;ures occa&s;ion her to cry out for her ab&s;ent &s;on. Selim hearing her voice, enters, Barbaro&s;&s;a orders him to retire; Zaphira very oddly we think, prays his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for what could the aid of a &s;ingle, unarmed &s;lave avail again&s;t the de|termination of a monarch &s;urrounded by guards; however, Selim tries what &s;olicitation will do; find|ing that vain, he makes a final effort with his dag|ger; Barbaro&s;&s;a evades the blow, and delivers him to the guards, when pri&s;oner he avows him&s;elf the identical Selim; this &s;udden di&s;covery of her &s;on, and his de&s;parate &s;ituation, overwhelms Zaphira; &s;he faints, and he, running to embrace her, they are torn a&s;under.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="305">When the Queen recovers, Barbaro&s;&s;a renews his order for her being forceably borne off; this again reduces Selim to his knees, the u&s;urper wi&s;h|ing to touch her heart in the tendere&s;t vein, orders her &s;on to be borne to the rack; &s;o &s;evere a trial works her to compliance with the marriage; the Prince, with noble di&s;dain and un&s;hakeable re|&s;olution, declines life, gained by &s;o &s;hameful a purcha&s;e; &s;he catches the noble flame, and both defying the tyrant's power, they are carried off &s;eparately.</P>
<P>Aladin increa&s;es the confu&s;ion and rage of Bar|baro&s;&s;a, by giving certain intelligence of a con|&s;piracy in the city; he orders out &s;pies to di&s;cover, if po&s;&s;ible, the members of it, then commands Selim's immediate death, and goes off breathing threats, dreadful in their tenor.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, we again meet him; enquiring whether proper precautions are ta|ken, and ob&s;erving, that the &s;pies which were &s;ent out, have found no trace of tumult; the &s;econd watch he dooms for Selim's final moment. Irene once more comes a &s;uppliant to her father, and with tears offers up petitionary plaints, yet is treated with unu&s;ual, or rather increa&s;ed &s;everity; however the urgent occa&s;ion, and the violent emotion of her heart, in favour of the man &s;he loves, oblige her to per&s;evere till her enraged fire orders the guards to force her off.</P>
<P>Left alone, the perilous condition ambition has brought him to, pre&s;ents it&s;elf to his di&s;heartened mind; upon enquiring for Othman, Aladin &s;ays, that he is fled, and that much danger may be ap|prehended; the following line uttered in Barbaro&s;|&s;a's
<PB N="300" REF="306">
fury is unpardonably vulgar,  <Q REND="inline">"Why then, may all hell's cur&s;es follow him,"</Q> this fre&s;h alarm pre|cipitates the Prince's fate, and the u&s;urper with mo&s;t vindictive ideas goes to &s;ee him put to the rack, unle&s;s propo&s;ed conce&s;&s;ions mitigate his &s;entence.</P>
<P>Selim, &s;urrounded by executioners, appears no further concerned than that his remains may not be treated with di&s;re&s;pect; but that &s;eems an unnece&s;|&s;ary application, &s;ince the great foe who robs him of life mu&s;t have equal power, with perhaps equal antipathy over his breathle&s;s body, that he has to the animated; Barbaro&s;&s;a entering, orders him to be rai&s;ed from the ground, and a&s;ks if his life is not forfeited upon his own principles; the Prince de|&s;ires him to take it; however, the tyrant, for Za|phira's &s;ake expo&s;tulates, till contemptuous refu|&s;al, and &s;ound of the &s;econd watch, end the fruit|le&s;s conference, Selim is left to the rack, and they are binding him with cords when Irene's entrance gains him a &s;mall re&s;pite. Far from upbraiding her with her father's cruelty, he treats her in the ten|dere&s;t manner, and &s;trives to &s;often that woe &s;he feels, as &s;uppo&s;ing her&s;elf the means of his being di&s;covered, &s;he begs forgivene&s;s, which he mo&s;t readily grants, and commits his mother to her care.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as they are fixing him to the rack, a tumult is heard, which fills him with &s;pirit, and the guards with di&s;may. Aladin enters in confu&s;ion, and calls off the officers, &amp;c. to a&s;&s;i&s;t Barbaro&s;&s;a. Irene now again melts with tenderne&s;s for her father's danger, and hearing the cla&s;h of &s;words goes off in a &s;tate of di&s;tracted grief: Othman entering with a party frees
<PB N="301" REF="307">
Selim, and gives him a &s;word, with which he goes to &s;eek his mortal foe.</P>
<P>The tyrant, like Macbeth, tied to a &s;take, knows not what &s;tep to take. Othman encounters, and gives him a mortal wound, at which in&s;tant Selim enters. Seeing Barbaro&s;&s;a pro&s;trate, he regrets that his hand had not given the blow, and calls on the murderer, that he may awake the &s;tings of remor&s;e. His words have the de&s;ired effect, and when he finds the expiring mon&s;ter contrite, his generous temper takes &s;o humane a turn, that he &s;olicits heaven's mercy in his favour.</P>
<P>After the tyrant begs protection for his daugh|ter, and draws his la&s;t breath, the Prince gives or|ders to &s;top all ho&s;tilities. It is an amiable &s;troke when Sadi moves that the body of Barbaro&s;&s;a &s;hould be dragged about the &s;treets, for Selim to forbid &s;uch inhumanity. Zaphira, filled with apprehen|&s;ions, enters, jealous of her &s;teps, and fearful of every one &s;he &s;ees; but &s;oon perceives with joy the happy revolution of affairs. After mutual congratulations, and pious acknowledgment to heaven, Selim a&s;ks for Irene, who, by Othman's order, has been taken care of. Zaphira pronounces her worthy to partake his throne, which he acquie&s;ces in, and then con|cludes the piece, deducing its general moral in the following agreeable lines:
<Q><L>Now let us thank the eternal pow'r: convinc'd</L>
<L>That heav'n but tries our virtue by affliction:</L>
<L>That oft the cloud which wraps the pre&s;ent hour,</L>
<L>Serves but to brighten all our future days.</L></Q></P>
<P>Though Dr. Brown has in a previous adverti&s;e|ment, pompou&s;ly paraded his &s;teady adherence to
<PB N="302" REF="308">
the ancient drama in this compo&s;ition, yet, I be|lieve, had he not mentioned it, no reader would have found it out; he has indeed, been &s;crupulou&s;ly nice with re&s;pect to time and place, but vigour of genius is wanting, and there is much more labour than fancy: from the former he has devi&s;ed a plot, which pre&s;ents us with &s;everal &s;triking incidents, and works on to a ju&s;t, agreeable and in&s;tructive cata&s;trophe; but being deficient of the latter, ex|pre&s;&s;ion in many of the &s;cenes is &s;o languid, that if it does affect, it mu&s;t be more through the merit of the actor than the poet.</P>
<P>Barbaro&s;&s;a is an ample &s;ubject for dete&s;tation to work, not a ray of virtue can we perceive to light his gloomy frame; haughty, revengeful, lu&s;tful, and cruel. A wretch, eaten up with impious pa&s;|&s;ions, and an entire &s;lave to each of them; a cur&s;e to him&s;elf, and a plague to human kind; at lea&s;t, that part of it which unhappily came within his &s;phere. There is &s;uch a mixture of gloom, fire and affected &s;oftne&s;s, that it requires very uncommon powers to give this part due force. Mr. MOSSOP made it &s;o con&s;picuous, that we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, as the author no doubt formed the character for him, &s;o nature formed him for it. We cannot de&s;cribe how amazingly he improved his original, and &s;trengthened many weak pa&s;&s;ages which mu&s;t lie heavy on performers of le&s;s ability. Alas! Mr. BENSLEY, Mr. COLMAN puts you as Marlborough did John Duke of Argyle, upon all the mo&s;t hazard|ous attempts: for heaven's &s;ake, re&s;ign the &s;ove|reignty of Algiers; dont mi&s;lead your&s;elf, by think|ing that goggling the eye-balls will give the idea of a &s;tern a&s;pect; nor imagine, that pu&s;hing one &s;hould|er
<PB N="303" REF="309">
before the other, and rolling like a Dutch long|boat in a rough &s;ea, can pa&s;s for dignity of deport|ment. We would mo&s;t humbly, in the &s;incerity of friendly wi&s;hes, advi&s;e you to change places with Mr. CLARKE; a prudent retreat is no &s;mall part of general&s;hip; if the managers &s;hould threaten you with a Chancery &s;uit for declining his mighty ap|pointment, try if you cant get him to &s;tand the roa&s;t in a &s;imilar manner.</P>
<P>Achmet is an object as amiable as his vile com|petitor is horrid; his &s;ituation very critical, his un|dertaking noble, his filial piety un&s;hakeable, his ho|nour inviolate, his love di&s;intere&s;ted, his friend&s;hip warm, permanent and affable; his di&s;po&s;ition gen|tle, even to foes, and his courage equal to any dan|ger. As a part, he is much better written than Barbaro&s;&s;a, yet many of his &s;peeches want nerve, which indeed Mr. GARRICK mo&s;t amply &s;upplied. There are &s;everal breaks and pa&s;&s;ages in this cha|racter, which &s;eem in peru&s;al to have very little meaning; yet he &s;ent them thrilling through the heart, and then brought them flowing from the eyes.</P>
<P>Mr. SAVIGNY, being as yet a very young per|former, in point of practice, which is highly e&s;&s;ential to perfection, we mu&s;t, as far as impartiality will admit, touch him with a lenient hand. Whether this part was cho&s;en by him&s;elf, or recommended by &s;ome anxious friend, we can by no means ap|prove it for a beginning; there is &s;uch an intricacy, &s;o many tran&s;itions, &s;uch a variety of manoeuvres, commonly called &s;tage bu&s;ine&s;s, that two &s;ea&s;ons, at lea&s;t, are nece&s;&s;aay to cultivate properly even &s;uch a|bilities as are naturally adequate to the undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="310">The gentleman who has lately appeared, &s;eems to &s;peak, bating the barbari&s;m of <HI>furm</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>firm, &s;turn</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>&s;tern,</HI> and being faultily emphatic upon <HI>thy, thee,</HI> and <HI>thou,</HI> with propriety: the middle and lower notes of his voice harmoniou&s;ly di&s;tinct, and either from nature or imitation, very like tho&s;e of Mr. GARRICK. We are told, that he has very exten&s;ive powers, we wi&s;h it may prove &s;o, but we could not perceive any pro&s;pect of &s;uch. In the mid&s;t of fir&s;t night fear, they will break out, though irregularly. Mr. BARRY and Mr. MOSSOP, &s;hewed their excellent voices in their fir&s;t attempts, though doubtle&s;s not &s;o well as they have &s;ince exerted them.</P>

<HEAD>MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. A COMEDY: By SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>LEONATO Governor of Me&s;&s;ina, begins this piece, peru&s;ing a letter from Don Pedro, of Arra|gon, by which he is informed of that Prince's ar|rival the &s;ame evening; he que&s;tions the me&s;&s;enger concerning a battle which has been fought; this occa&s;ions honourable mention to be made of one Claudio, a young Florentine; Beatrice enquires for Benedick, and is tartly witty at his expence. The Prince entering with his &s;uit, &s;alutes Leonato; Benedict happening to let fall &s;ome words, Beatrice immediately attacks him, and a &s;hort altercation of quibbling raillery en&s;ues, more pregnant with plea|&s;antry than meaning. While they are playing the game of &s;nip-&s;nap, we find Don Pedro has accept|ed Leonato's invitation, to &s;tay a month or more at his hou&s;e,</P>
<P>When all go off but Claudio and Benedict, the former a&s;ks the latter if he has noticed Leonato's daughter; after humorou&s;ly giving his opinion of her, he obtains from Claudio a confe&s;&s;ion of love for the young lady; this he acquaints the Prince with on his return, who &s;eems to approve Hero as an object worthy of affection: Benedick, from an a&s;&s;umed contempt of amorous feelings, puns and quibbles ludicrou&s;ly, not only upon the &s;ubject of Claudio's pa&s;&s;ion, but upon matrimonial connec|tions
<PB N="308" REF="314">
in general; his remarks occa&s;ion the Prince and lover to retort, by ob&s;erving, that he, for all his boa&s;ting will fall into the &s;nare; however, the confident batchelor thinks his freedom in no danger, and proclaims him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of un&s;hakeable in|dependance; Pedro &s;ends Benedick off to acquaint Leonato he will attend his &s;upper.</P>
<P>Claudio being alone with the Prince, profe&s;&s;es at large his affection for Hero, and that it may not &s;eem a &s;udden &s;tart of fancy, declares, that he loved her before his going to the war, they have lately been engaged in; then &s;ollicits Pedro's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in fa|vour of his &s;uit, which is readily and cordially granted to him, for which purpo&s;e the Prince, knowing there is to be a ma&s;querade, lays a &s;cheme for &s;ounding Hero's inclination; which is to a&s;&s;ume the character of Claudio, and in that &s;hape to make &s;trong declarations of love.</P>
<P>This &s;ettled, they go off to make way for Anto|nio and Leonato; the former tells the latter that a &s;ervant of his has overheard the Prince declaring a pa&s;&s;ion for Hero, and that he intended mention of it to her during the ma&s;querade; this &s;eems very improbable, there being no time for Antonio's re|ceiving &s;uch a piece of information, as one party enter immediately upon the other's departure; Leo|nato, though he does not &s;eem to lay much weight on the di&s;covery, neverthele&s;s, determines to ac|quaint his daughter with the matter, that in ca&s;e it &s;hould be fact, &s;he may be the better prepared.</P>
<P>When the old gentlemen di&s;appear, Don John and Conrade come forward; from their conver|&s;ation, it appears, that Don John is of a &s;urly mi&s;|chievous di&s;po&s;ition; that he hates obligations, and
<PB N="309" REF="315">
would injure the Prince, his brother, who has late|ly re&s;tored him to that place in fraternal affection, which his ill behaviour had forfeited. Conrade advi&s;es him to a &s;moother mode of behaviour, but villainy being the fir&s;t fruit of his heart, he deter|mines to pur&s;ue it. Upon being informed by Bo|rachio of an intended marriage, he goes off with the malevolent intention of di&s;turbing the peace of tho&s;e who never injured him.</P>
<P>At the begginning of the &s;econd act, Leonato enquires whether Don John was not at &s;upper; mention of this gloomy blade, occa&s;ions &s;prightly Beatrice to remark &s;hrewdly upon the contra&s;t be|tween him and Benedick; the following part of this &s;cene is made up of rhap&s;odical ob&s;ervations, upon love, marriage, maids and batchelors, by this loquacious lady; the ma&s;quers coming on, Pedro &s;ingles out Hero, who has been prepared by her father; he &s;ollicits conference, but is baffled by her an&s;wers; while they retire, other characters play on each other; among the re&s;t Benedick and Beatrice encounter, who&s;e phra&s;es are bandied to and fro with all the quickne&s;s and levity of a &s;hut|tle-cock: under cover, &s;he cuts him up to him|&s;elf; after a dance, Don John comes forward with Borachio, they mi&s;take Claudio for Benedick, and acquaint him that the Prince is in love with Hero, de&s;iring him to prevent &s;o inadequate a connection; when they are gone off, Claudio meditates upon what he has heard with mo&s;t &s;trange feelings of jealou&s;y; the Prince had to him declared a de&s;ign of wooing Hero in his favour; yet now he is &s;ur|prized to hear that what they had agreed upon has been put in practice; nothing but the ab&s;urdi|ties
<PB N="310" REF="316">
lovers are capable of, could po&s;&s;ibly ju&s;tify this.</P>
<P>While he is in peevi&s;h mood, Benedick comes on, and je&s;tingly confirms his jealou&s;y, which teizing of his ruffled temper, occa&s;ions a &s;udden retreat. Pedro approaching, is charged with having caught the affection of Hero, which he declares to be won in favour of Claudio; the Prince mentioning a quarrel Beatrice has to Benedick, he gives a very fanciful and humorous account of his own me&s;|&s;age by that volatile dame; ju&s;t as he has fini&s;hed his account, &s;he appears; &s;eeing her, he ha&s;tens off, as if terrified at the thoughts of encountering &s;o nimble and bitter a tongue.</P>
<P>When Pedro &s;ays to Beatrice that &s;he has <HI>put down</HI> Benedick, &s;he makes a reply rather reprehen|&s;ible, as rai&s;ing a gro&s;s idea,  <Q REND="inline">"So I would not he &s;hould do me, my Lord, le&s;t I &s;hould <HI>prove</HI> the <HI>mother</HI> of <HI>fools.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The Prince, perceiving a cloud on Claudio's coun|tenance, demands the rea&s;on, to which he receives equivocal replies; Benedick is guilty of a vulgari&s;m when he &s;ays the Count is <HI>civil</HI> as an orange, the name being <HI>Seville</HI>; at be&s;t, like many others in this play it is a &s;trained pun.</P>
<P>When Pedro declares that he wooed Hero for Claudio, Leonato gives her in form to the raptured lover; this di&s;po&s;al of her cou&s;in, &s;ets Beatrice rat|tling once more; &s;he is again blameable for reply|ing to Pedro as &s;he does, when he &s;ays,  <Q REND="inline">"&s;hall I get you a hu&s;band, I had rather have one of your <HI>father's getting</HI>"</Q>. When &s;he is &s;ent off by her un|cle, Claudio's wedding is fixed for that day week, and by way of making the interval tedious to im|patient
<PB N="311" REF="317">
love, pa&s;s more agreeably, Pedro propo&s;es to attempt working Benedick and Beatrice into a violent affection for each other; with this plea&s;ant propo&s;al the &s;cene concludes.</P>
<P>Don John enters with his hopeful a&s;&s;ociate Borachio; the former wi&s;hing, at any rate, by any impediment to cro&s;s Claudio's marriage; to effect this purpo&s;e, Borachio lays a villainous plan, through his intimacy with Margaret, Hero's wait|ing-woman; for this infamous project John pro|mi&s;es the tool of his iniquity a thou&s;and ducats, and they go off to forward their execrable plan.</P>
<P>Benedick enters in Leonato's garden, with a boy, whom he &s;ends for a book: In &s;oliloquy, he ex|pre&s;&s;es &s;urprize, that Claudio, who formerly u&s;ed to laugh at love, &s;hould fall &s;o effectually into the &s;nare him&s;elf: He then proceeds to enquire, whether his own mind can be &s;o &s;trangely altered; and, with a very natural, plea&s;ant degree of confidence, &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch a metamorpho&s;e impo&s;&s;ible. This &s;peech is much in favour of the actor, and truly agreeable to the audience.</P>
<P>Seeing the Prince, Claudio and Balthazar ap|proach, he retires behind an arbour: after a plea|&s;ing &s;ong, they enter upon the &s;ubject of Beatrice's love for Benedick; perceiving that he li&s;tens, all po&s;&s;ible &s;ymptoms of violent affection in that lady are mentioned, which Benedick &s;wallows the more greedily, as being advanced and avouched by &s;o grave and venerable a character as grey-headed Leonato. The train of deception is admirably carried on through this &s;cene, and when Benedick is left alone to ruminate upon what he has heard, he
<PB N="312" REF="318">
does it mo&s;t humorou&s;ly. He &s;eems to fear &s;ome fla&s;hes of wit, if he &s;hould appear &s;erious in a love affair, yet argues him&s;elf into a favourable opinion. She enters, and invites him to dinner; her words, though not kind, or even polite, he interprets fa|vourably; and concludes the &s;econd act with re|&s;olving to get her picture.</P>
<P>Hero, Margaret, and Ur&s;ula, open the third act. Hero &s;ends Margaret to draw Beatrice into the gar|den; it appears, that the &s;ame de&s;ign is now to be put in practice upon her, as Leonato and Claudio wrought upon Benedick, in the foregoing act; for this purpo&s;e Hero in&s;tructs Ur&s;ula. Seeing Bea|trice &s;teal into a woodbine arbour, they proceed on the &s;ubject of Benedick's love for her, and anatomize her &s;pirit of pride and coquettry pretty &s;everely: while they blazon him with the warme&s;t terms of commendation. After they have exhau&s;ted prai&s;e upon one, and &s;atire on the other, they go off. From what Beatrice &s;ays, when alone, it appears, that their conver&s;ation has produced the de&s;ired ef|fect, and occa&s;ioned her to think &s;eriou&s;ly of Bene|dick. This &s;cene has con&s;iderable merit, but being exactly &s;imilar to that which ends the &s;econd act, cannot take equal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an audience.</P>
<P>Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick and Leonato, ap|pear next: the Prince declares his intention of &s;tay|ing till Claudio's marriage is con&s;ummated; then propo&s;es going for Arragon, and that Benedick &s;hould go with him. This draws on &s;ome ob&s;erva|tions which charge Benedick with being in love, the Prince and Claudio mention &s;everal plea&s;ant &s;ymp|toms to prove their &s;ugge&s;tion: when Benedick
<PB N="313" REF="319">
walks a&s;ide to &s;peak with Leonato, Don John en|ters, and charges Hero with being di&s;loyal; this naturally &s;urprizes the Prince and her lover; who, upon being offered ocular demon&s;tration of her licentiou&s;ne&s;s, jointly determine to expo&s;e her, and break off the marriage.</P>
<P>When they go off, we are pre&s;ented with Dog|berry, Verges, and Watchmen. This &s;cene exhi|bits in the Con&s;table and his a&s;&s;ociate, a very laugh|able picture of blundering, ignorant con&s;equence; the neglect and villainy of nocturnal guards, is very well, and keenly touched upon: after giving the watchmen charge to look &s;harply about Leonato's hou&s;e, Dogberry goes off. Here Borachio and Conrade enter; the&s;e worthy gentlemen, not &s;u&s;|pecting eves-droppers, talk over the whole of the plot again&s;t Hero, how Margaret being &s;ub&s;tituted for her, Claudio had &s;wallowed the deceit, and de|termined upon expo&s;ing his intended bride in the temple; the watchmen having overheard this hope|ful conference, take them into cu&s;tody, and hurry them off the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Hero next enters with Margaret, they conver&s;e about a wedding-&s;uit; Beatrice joins them, and profe&s;&s;ing her&s;elf ill at ea&s;e, Margaret archly puns upon Benedick's name, by advi&s;ing her to lay &s;ome <HI>Carduus Benedictus</HI> to her heart. After &s;ome plea|&s;ant raillery upon Beatrice's complaint, they retire to dre&s;s Hero for her nuptials.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene we are entertained with a very whim&s;ical account which Dogberry and Verges give Leonato of the two men the watch have taken up; their roundabout, &s;uperfluous manner, is truly diverting. Leonato, wearied with their verbo&s;ity,
<PB N="314" REF="320">
de&s;ires them to que&s;tion the culprits, and bring him the examination. At the beginning of the fourth act, we meet the bride, bridgeroom, prie&s;t, and all the nuptial gue&s;ts. Upon the Friar's a&s;king Clau|dio if he is not come to marry the lady, he an&s;wers no; upon que&s;tioning Hero, &s;he replies in the af|firmative; to the next interrogation, whether any lawful impediment is known, Claudio replies in a &s;train not very intelligible to the company, till he explains the matter in &s;uch lines as we think wor|thy tran&s;cribing.</P>
<Q><L>She's but the &s;ign and &s;emblance of her honour;</L>
<L>Behold how like a maid &s;he blu&s;hes here:</L>
<L>Oh what authority and &s;hew of truth,</L>
<L>Can cunning &s;in cover it&s;elf withal:</L>
<L>Comes not that blood as mode&s;t evidence</L>
<L>To witne&s;s &s;imple virtue? would you not &s;wear</L>
<L>All you that &s;ee her that &s;he is maid,</L>
<L>By the&s;e exterior &s;hows? yet &s;he is none,</L>
<L>She knows the heat of a luxurious bed,</L>
<L>Her blu&s;h is guiltine&s;s not mode&s;ty.</L></Q>
<P>So unexpected and heavy a charge, &s;upported by the Prince and Don John, &s;trikes Leonato to the heart; and &s;o far overpowers his unhappy daugh|ter, that &s;he faints. When the accu&s;ers are gone, the wretched father breaths forth his &s;orrow in very pathetic and bitter plaints; patience is urged, and a vindication of Hero attempted by Benedick and Beatrice, but Leonato &s;eems from &s;uch reputable evidence, to think the accu&s;ation ju&s;t. The Friar, in a mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, humane, fanciful addre&s;s, takes up the injured lady's cau&s;e, who &s;peaks of her own innocence with melting mode&s;ty. Her father, up|on a &s;urmi&s;e that it may be the effect of &s;ome ba&s;e
<PB N="315" REF="321">
de&s;ign, delivers him&s;elf with very emphatic &s;pirit: the Friar, who prudently prefers moderate mea|&s;ures, de&s;ires that a report of her death, in con&s;e|quence of &s;lander, may be &s;pread, in order to work out her exculpation; or to give an opportunity, if guilt is confirmed, of &s;ecreting her from the world. To this &s;alutary advice Leonato agrees. The o|ther characters being gone off, Benedick and Bea|trice remain, who both entertain a favourable opi|nion of Hero; after urging him to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of her cou&s;in, a pretty entertaining declara|tion of mutual affection, comes from the&s;e whim&s;i|cal lovers; and Benedick, in compliance with his mi&s;tre&s;s's earne&s;t de&s;ire, goes off, fully bent on chal|lenging Claudio.</P>
<P>Dogberry and Verges, with their pri&s;oners and others, next appear; this examination of Conrade and Borachio, confirms the laughable idea we have already entertained of their con&s;equential examiners: after much quibble, they are confronted by the watchmen, who unfold the affair of Don John's bribing Borachio with a thou&s;and ducats to &s;lander Hero; this di&s;covery being made, they are or|dered to be carried before Leonato; this part of the bu&s;ine&s;s falls to the lot of Dogberry and Ver|ges, the former of whom, upon being called an a&s;s by Conrade, makes &s;ome very ri&s;ible remarks.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, Antonio is comforting his brother Leonato, who replies to his con&s;olation, in terms that we mu&s;t offer to our rea|der's peru&s;al, as truly beautiful, and &s;trictly argu|mentative:
<Q><PB N="316" REF="322">
<L>I pray thee cea&s;e thy coun&s;el,</L>
<L>Which falls into my ears as profitle&s;s</L>
<L>As water in a &s;ieve; give not me coun&s;el</L>
<L>Nor let no comfort el&s;e delight mine ear;</L>
<L>But &s;uch a one who&s;e wrongs doth &s;uit with mine;</L>
<L>Bring me a father who &s;o lov'd his child,</L>
<L>Who&s;e joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,</L>
<L>And bid him &s;peak to me of patience.</L>
<L>But there is no &s;uch man; for, brother, men</L>
<L>Can coun&s;el and give comfort to that grief</L>
<L>Which they them&s;elves not feel; but ta&s;ting it,</L>
<L>Their coun&s;el turns to pa&s;&s;ion, which before</L>
<L>Would give preceptial medicine to rage,</L>
<L>Fetter &s;trong madne&s;s with a &s;ilken thread,</L>
<L>Charm ach with air, and agony with words:</L>
<L>No, no, 'tis all men's office to &s;peak patience</L>
<L>To tho&s;e that wring under the load of &s;orrow;</L>
<L>But no man's virtue nor &s;ufficiency</L>
<L>To be &s;o moral when he &s;hall endure</L>
<L>The like him&s;elf: therefore, give me no coun&s;el,</L>
<L>For there was never yet philo&s;opher</L>
<L>Who could endure the tooth-ach patiently;</L>
<L>However, they have writ the &s;tile of gods,</L>
<L>And made a pi&s;h at chance and &s;ufferance.</L></Q></P>
<P>Don Pedro and Claudio entering, the old man acco&s;ts them in angry terms, which they wave, though Claudio receives a regular challenge from him, and both of them from Antonio. The Prince, in palliative terms, laments Hero's death, but a&s;&s;erts, that the charge which occa&s;ioned it was founded in truth; this, as he refu&s;es to hear a vindication of her, &s;ends off the old gentlemen violently agitated with pa&s;&s;ion. No &s;ooner do they di&s;appear, than Benedict, ripe for quarrel, comes forward; they joke with him, but find that he is thoroughly bent upon a forceable vindication of Hero's bla&s;ted re|putation;
<PB N="317" REF="323">
however, they jeer him, by giving the matter a ludicrous turn, and make mention of Bea|trice. Benedick is neither to be frighted nor &s;oothed, and leaves them, promi&s;ing revenge upon Claudio.</P>
<P>Dogberry and Verges here bring on the pri&s;o|ners Borachio and Conrade, who make a full con|fe&s;&s;ion of their &s;landerous guilt to the Prince: this unexpected intelligence, as may be well &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;trikes him and Claudio with &s;orrowful a&s;toni&s;h|ment. Leonato entering, after having been ac|quainted with the villainy, receives from Borachio a &s;econd confe&s;&s;ion; however, in the zeal of re&s;ent|ment, he charges the injury his daughter has re|ceived again&s;t the Prince and Claudio. After &s;ome exculpatory addre&s;&s;es upon their &s;ide, he &s;oftens, and propo&s;es, as Hero is irrecoverable, that Claudio &s;hall marry a neice of his; this being agreed to, they go off, after Dogberry, with farcical &s;olemnity, has complained of being called an a&s;s.</P>
<P>Benedick comes on with Margaret, whom, after &s;ome quibbling, and not very decent &s;peeches, he &s;ends for Beatrice. When alone, he plea&s;antly de|&s;cribes his love-&s;ick &s;ituation: the lady comes on, when a very unimportant conference en&s;ues, which ends ju&s;t as it begins: Ur&s;ula communicating the di&s;covery of Hero's innocence, they go off to hear it more at large. The next &s;cene at Hero's monu|ment is, and we think ju&s;tly, omitted in repre&s;enta|tion.</P>
<P>When the author brings us to Leonato's hou&s;e, we find Benedick &s;oliciting the Friar's matrimonial a&s;&s;i&s;tance, upon which Leonato mentions the man|ner how he had been tricked into love. Pedro and
<PB N="318" REF="324">
Claudio appearing, according to appointment, He|ro, under cover of a ma&s;k, is brought on; when Claudio &s;olemnly receives her at the Friar's hand, &s;he reveals her&s;elf to the a&s;toni&s;hment and joy of her fir&s;t intended hu&s;band. The explanation of this &s;eeming riddle being referred to another op|portunity, Benedick and Beatrice, by the interven|tion of other parties, conclude their match, and &s;o concludes the piece.</P>
<P>When we take a general view of this comedy, we mu&s;t be &s;urprized that SHAKESPEARE him&s;elf could make &s;o much of &s;o little; the plot has ra|ther a romantic air, and is, in point of merit, but very moderate; the unities are not gro&s;sly violated; the cata&s;trophe is &s;atisfactory, the language ea&s;y and &s;pirited; many of the &s;entiments di&s;cover fancy and good &s;en&s;e, and the characters are well &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>Benedick is a very plea&s;ant effu&s;ion of genius, we have no rea&s;on to allow him any virtue, or to charge him with any vices. He is a humori&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very laughable peculiarity, we dont often meet &s;uch a per&s;onage in private life, yet we are glad to &s;ee him on the &s;tage, e&s;pecially when repre&s;ented by Mr. GARRICK.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of our modern ROSCIUS, after what has already been offered, we mu&s;t either limit our prai&s;e, or &s;ay over again what has been &s;aid before: general &s;uffrage has for many years authorized the warme&s;t encomiums upon this great man in Bene|dick; it has been &s;et down by many leading critics as his be&s;t comic character, but this opinion we cannot implicitly admit, notwith&s;tanding we are willing to allow the pre-eminence of his &s;ignificant
<PB N="319" REF="325">
features, the di&s;tinct volubility of his expre&s;&s;ion, and his &s;tage manoeuvres; in the &s;cenes of repartee with Beatrice, his di&s;tinct vivacity gives uncommon &s;atisfaction. It is a character not &s;o well &s;uited to his age and figure as it was &s;ome years ago, yet we have no idea of any performer now on the &s;tage who could render it &s;o agreeable as he &s;till can.</P>
<P>We have attended Mr. KING's performance of Benedick with much critical plea&s;ure, and if we had never fea&s;ted upon Mr. GARRICK's &s;uperior merit, 'tis highly probable we &s;hould never have wi&s;hed for any thing better.</P>
<P>Mr. LEE, if he had not laboriou&s;ly methodized good natural requi&s;ites into mo&s;t offen&s;ive oddity, might have de&s;erved con&s;iderable reputation in this part; as it is, though nature has &s;uffered &s;o much from palpable art, he has his admirers, and in &s;ome few pa&s;&s;ages really merits them. It is painful to think that any man who does not want &s;en&s;e, &s;hould become &s;uch a clock-work actor, mi&s;taking mecha|ni&s;m for ea&s;e, and &s;tiffne&s;s for propriety. We have been tortured both in eyes and ears by Mr. SHE|RIDAN's barbarous attempts on this part.</P>
<P>Claudio is a gentle youth, who falls &s;uddenly in love, and gives up the object of his pa&s;&s;ion with le&s;s feeling, in our apprehen&s;ion, than he ought: there is nothing in the part which requires, or could &s;hew great abilities, yet it is much too important for Mr. CAUTHERLY's very feeble abilities, and was much better &s;upplied by the late Mr. PALMER, though in &s;ome mea&s;ure a marrer of blank ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Leonato is a very re&s;pectable, uniform per&s;o|nage; a &s;en&s;ible, feeling father, who utters &s;everal &s;entiments decked with &s;uitable &s;tile, that do the
<PB N="320" REF="326">
author great credit. When warmed by the &s;up|po&s;ed guilt of his daughter, his expre&s;&s;ions, if the actor does them ju&s;tice, mu&s;t affect every heart ca|pable of impre&s;&s;ion: we are &s;orry to remark, that Mr. AICKIN is by no means capable of working this e&s;&s;ential effect, or, if capable, has not been able to &s;hew the lea&s;t trace of it; he fails extremely in attempting to de&s;cribe the force and delicacy of paternal feelings.</P>
<P>Mr. BERRY went as much beyond the tender parts of Leonato, as the la&s;t mentioned gentleman falls below them. It is much to be wi&s;hed that old men of a &s;erious ca&s;t were put into abler hands; the &s;tage has had an irreparable lo&s;s, in this parti|cular, by the death of Mr. POWELL, e&s;pecially as Mr. ROSS, who&s;e capabilities might be very re|&s;pectable in this view, manife&s;ts mo&s;t weari&s;ome negligence.</P>
<P>There is no point of excellence in which SHAKE|SPEARE has more di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf than in the variety and propriety of his characters: if we look through many pieces, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the la&s;t twenty years, we &s;hall perceive a di&s;gu&s;tful &s;ame|ne&s;s of &s;tile; lords and valets, ladies and chamber|maids, maintain nearly the &s;ame dialogue; &s;uch in|&s;ipidity SHAKESPEARE's good &s;en&s;e, knowledge of nature, and powerful genius di&s;dained: a great number of &s;triking in&s;tances might be offered from his works, in proof of this a&s;&s;ertion; and, among the re&s;t, his Dogberry and Verges, who are as whim&s;ically imagined, and as well &s;upported, as any characters we know; their &s;olemn buffoonery and blundering importance, mu&s;t be rich enter|tainment for the grave&s;t mind.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="327">Mr. TASWELL, who&s;e dryne&s;s of humour, quaintne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, and laughable ca&s;t of fea|tures will never be excelled, gave every idea of Dogberry that the author &s;eems to have meant; at pre&s;ent, Mr. PARSONS, though not quite equal in excellence to his humorous predece&s;&s;or, well de|&s;erves the warm applau&s;e he receives. Mr. HAR|TRY, who has a mo&s;t peculiar and happy counte|nance for the caricature of low comedy, is the be&s;t Verges we remember to have &s;een; laughter feels &s;ome injury from not having a little more of him. All the other male characters in this play are &s;o im|material, with re&s;pect to performance, that we deem our&s;elves excu&s;able in declining mention of them; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on two of the females only will come under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Hero is an amiable young lady, thrown into a painful and pitiable predicament; the part is pret|ty, but feeble; it requires an agreeable, though not a great actre&s;s. Having &s;aid thus much, we be|lieve our readers will readily concur in opinion, that it need not be more plea&s;ingly &s;upplied than by Mrs. W. BARRY.</P>
<P>Beatrice &s;eems to have engaged as much of our author's attention as Benedick, and is equally well &s;upported; as a child of whim &s;he is extremely plea&s;ant. Mrs. PRITCHARD was &s;o excellent in this part, and &s;truck out &s;uch uni&s;on merit with Mr. GARRICK, that her uncharacteri&s;tic corpulence was always overlooked. Mrs. WOFFINGTON we have heard receive con&s;iderable applau&s;e, which &s;he well de&s;erved; and though we could wi&s;h to &s;ee Mrs. ABINGTON's &s;uperior talents put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion

<HEAD>The REVENGE. A TRAGEDY: By Dr. YOUNG.</HEAD>
<P>THIS piece opens with judicious &s;olemnity. A night &s;cene, attended with elementary concu&s;&s;ions, lightning, thunder, wind, hail, &amp;c. introduces Zanga, the captive Moor, who, from perturbation of mind, enjoys the &s;torm. I&s;abella, who appears to be his mi&s;tre&s;s, through tenderne&s;s of regard, follows him into the lonely retreat of gloomy me|ditation; her &s;olicitations and tears draw from him an elegant and &s;pirited acount of what has laid the foundation of his di&s;content.</P>
<P>Hence, it appears, that being &s;on of a Moori&s;h monarch, at war with Spain, he fought in a battle where his father was killed, and he him&s;elf made pri&s;oner. That becoming Alonzo's, the Spani&s;h general's &s;lave, the victorious commander had given him as humane and friendly treatment as could be wi&s;hed; but, upon &s;ome &s;light occa&s;ion, in heat of pa&s;&s;ion, gave him a blow, which to Moori&s;h tem|pers, proves an offence never to be forgiven.</P>
<P>Having painted the agony of his mind to I&s;a|bella, who in vain urges patience, &s;he tells him that an expre&s;s is arrived from Alonzo; having devi&s;ed &s;ome means to damp the progre&s;s of that chief, he prays for favourable intelligence, and goes off to que&s;tion Don Carlos concerning it.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="330">Manuel and Carlos are now introduced, by whom we find that Alonzo, notwith&s;tanding Zan|ga's treachery, has obtained another compleat victory, attended with much &s;laughter of his foes. We are al&s;o informed, that Carlos was freed from a bondage among the Moors by that general, whom as a friend he had deputed as an advocate in love to the beauteous Leonora. We find likewi&s;e, that Alvarez, the young lady's father, from a love of wealth, countenances Don Carlos's pa&s;&s;ion, knowing that he is in hourly expectation of a &s;leet immen&s;ely rich.</P>
<P>Here the object of his affection appears, led by her hoary father, who, after warmly urging her ac|ceptance of Don Carlos, leaves them to an amorous tete-a-tete; the lover pre&s;&s;es his &s;uit with much tenderne&s;s, but her inclinations dont appear to wear that cordial conde&s;cen&s;ion he &s;eems to wi&s;h.</P>
<P>She evades his warme&s;t attacks, and leaves him to receive the triumphant Alonzo; who, upon his entrance, declares more &s;atisfaction in meeting his friend, than in the charms of fame and conque&s;t. After terms of &s;alutation and reciprocal regard are interchanged, Zanga comes on, informing Carlos of news from the port, to receive which he goes off.</P>
<P>Alonzo being left with the Moor, opens the &s;e|cret feelings of his heart, which, &s;urrounded by a blaze of glory, is yet wretched. He informs Zan|ga, that while he &s;hould have acted as the amba&s;&s;a|dor of love for his friend, Leonora's charms had compelled him to become the principal; a faint exculpatory circum&s;tance is mentioned, that having received no letters from Carlos, he concluded him dead; this mi&s;carriage in corre&s;pondence, it ap|pears,
<PB N="325" REF="331">
has happened through Zanga's treacherous, underhand dealing, to work his own &s;ini&s;ter pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>Seeing Leonora, the captivated conqueror goes off to meet her, which gives Zanga an opportunity of uttering &s;ome lines, fraught with mo&s;t vindictive malevolence. When the lovers come on, a long, laborious, and, in &s;ome places, laughable &s;cene en|&s;ues; the whole purport of which, is a violent &s;truggle of pride and love in the woman; love and friend&s;hip in the man. Our author has here made an attempt upon the power of action, injurious to that power; he has indulged his own imagina|tion contrary to the probability, at lea&s;t the repre|&s;entable probability of nature; for which rea&s;on the la&s;t &s;cene of the fir&s;t act is generally much and commendably curtailed on the &s;tage: at the con|clu&s;ion, Alonzo gives us a mo&s;t unmeaning jingle of rhimes, &s;ounding much, meaning little.</P>
<P>The &s;econd act commences with Zanga and Ma|nuel, informing the audience that Don Carlos's fleet is wrecked, and with it his fortune; hence Zanga &s;ugge&s;ts Alonzo's union with Leonora.</P>
<P>I&s;abella coming on, he makes enquiry of her con|cerning &s;ome material circum&s;tances, &s;ends for his tablets, and ruminates, in an emphatic &s;oliloquy, upon the connexion of circum&s;tances; wherein he di&s;plays a fund of policy for deep intrigue.</P>
<P>He determines upon working Alonzo to a mar|riage with Leonora, from which he draws hopes of a tempe&s;t that may wreck their peace; &s;ome lines he utters concerning that pa&s;&s;ion which he is endea|vouring to rai&s;e, being nearly equal to any we have
<PB N="326" REF="332">
met in any author, it would be unpardonable not to tran&s;cribe them.</P>
<Q><L>I have turn'd o'er the catalogue of woes</L>
<L>Which &s;ting the heart of man, and find none equal</L>
<L>It is the hydra of calamities:</L>
<L>The &s;even-fold death&mdash;the jealous are the damn'd&mdash;</L>
<L>Oh jealou&s;y! each other pa&s;&s;ion's calm</L>
<L>To thee, thou conflagration of the &s;oul,</L>
<L>Thou king of torments! thou grand counterpoi&s;e!</L>
<L>To all the torments beauty can in&s;pire.</L></Q>
<P>Upon Alonzo's entrance, Zanga, with profound artifice, congratulates him upon the certainty of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Leonora; the generous minded Spa|niard, though he doats on the woman, &s;till &s;truggles with the re&s;trictions of friend&s;hip. The artifices of Zanga are ma&s;terly, and at length determine Alon|zo to confer with Don Carlos.</P>
<P>After his departure, the author has again furni&s;h|ed his Moor with &s;ome lines of a ma&s;terly nature; boldly imagined, copiou&s;ly arranged, and emphati|cally expre&s;&s;ed. Don Carlos comes in upon his meditation, wrapped up in thought likewi&s;e. Don Carlos moralizes, in &s;oliloquy, with judgment and feeling; his &s;entiments, re&s;pecting hope and human happine&s;s, are founded in philo&s;ophical truth.</P>
<P>The Moor, warmly intent upon his evil purpo&s;es, pre&s;&s;es the melancholly lover to a re&s;ignation of his mi&s;tre&s;s, in favour of Alonzo; the voluntary &s;acri|fice of his deare&s;t wi&s;hes, though in de&s;pair of their ever being fulfilled, pains him &s;o much that he can|not comply; therefore, reque&s;ts Zanga to prevent an interview with his friend. This the Moor pro|mi&s;es,
<PB N="327" REF="333">
yet goes off with a determination to bring it about.</P>
<P>Carlos again ruminates upon the in&s;tability of temporal enjoyments; his remark on the power of beauty is ju&s;t and plea&s;ing. As he is going off, Zanga brings on Alonzo&mdash;Here a very delicate and pathetic &s;cene en&s;ues, wherein the friends manife&s;t a cordial feeling for each other. Alonzo's diffidence works the de&s;ired effect upon Carlos; who, at length, triumphs over the agony of his mind &s;o far, as not only to re&s;ign Leonora, but even to reque&s;t his friend's acceptance of that happine&s;s which he has been di&s;appointed of.</P>
<P>The general's mind is &s;o affected with this beha|viour, that he retires, and Carlos concludes the act with a very de&s;criptive a&s;&s;imulation of his own ca&s;e to that of Epaminondas, who lived with an arrow in his &s;ide till victory was proclaimed, and then draw|ing forth the mortal &s;haft expired.</P>
<P>The third act commences with Zanga, in a &s;tate of malevolent rejoicing, that his de&s;igns are in &s;o fair a train: by what he &s;ays to I&s;abella, we find Alonzo's nuptials have been compleated, and that a letter, forged by him, as from Carlos to Leonora, had fallen into the bridegroom's hands, on whom it had wrought a very powerful effect. Zanga's de|&s;cription of Alonzo, upon peru&s;al of the infamous &s;croll, is ma&s;terly painting.</P>
<P>When the general enters, teeming with jealous doubts, the Moor pretends to go off, that he may be called upon. After much preparation, which Zanga receives with artful &s;urprize; Alonzo com|municates the letter: here the Moor's hypocritical attachment is exhibited in &s;trong colours; to give
<PB N="328" REF="334">
the forgery fre&s;h force, he &s;hews the utmo&s;t con|cern for its contents; then, under a friendly pre|text, tears the paper. What follows in this &s;cene, &s;hews Alonzo to be of an open, un&s;u&s;pecting na|ture; an apt &s;ubject for impo&s;ition, and the Moor &s;hrewdly villainous.</P>
<P>The traitor draws forth every collateral circum|&s;tance which may increa&s;e the taint of his ma&s;ter's mind; after which, with fair faced tenderne&s;s, he &s;ends off the unhappy, deluded hu&s;band, to reflect upon a &s;ubject which he knows the more it is thought of, the more pain it gives. After putting a picture of Carlos into I&s;abella's hand, that &s;he may place it in Leonora's chamber, to ri&s;e up a corrobo|rative proof of infidelity, a gleam of remor&s;e breaks in upon the traiterous gloom of Zanga's mind; for a moment he feels compunction, and with great dignity of &s;entiment, reflects upon the di&s;graceful &s;tate of mental depravation his antipathy has led him to; however, his darling principle of revenge &s;uppre&s;&s;es every idea of remor&s;e, and even renders infamy meritorious. This is one ba&s;e effect of vio|lent prejudices, which &s;eldom fail to beautify the mo&s;t culpable and horrid purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act, we meet Alonzo labouring with increa&s;ed perplexity; he propo&s;es going to his wife, and by terrifying threats, to force the &s;ecret from her. This &s;tep, &s;o very dangerous to his hopes and views, the Moor art|fully evades, by taking upon him&s;elf, with much &s;eeming reluctance, the ta&s;k of explaining matters Ju&s;t as he commences his artful tale, the author has introduced Leonora, without, in our apprehen&s;ion, any purpo&s;e; therefore, the omi&s;&s;ion of her &s;hort,
<PB N="329" REF="335">
in&s;ignificant &s;cene, in action is judiciou&s;ly left out. The lady being di&s;patched, Zanga gives a formal account of what, in a garden by moonlight, he had &s;een pa&s;s between her and Carlos. The picture wears &s;uch &s;triking features of criminality, that Alonzo is even overwhelmed with conviction. When the confirmation of his wife's guilt is invin|cibly impre&s;&s;ed upon Alonzo's mind, &s;he is again introduced, and reproves him for avoiding his friends.</P>
<P>By a disjointed, unintelligible mode of behaviour, he alarms her feelings, and &s;he goes off, filled with very painful &s;en&s;ibility. Zanga returns, and hear|ing his ma&s;ter talk of death, gives him joy of having &s;acrificed Leonora to his ju&s;t jealou&s;y. Being in|formed that &s;he &s;till lives, he &s;ets at work every en|gine of in&s;inuation and di&s;&s;imulation to affect her de&s;truction; this point, at length, he gets deter|mined, and even obtains Alonzo's commi&s;&s;ion to get Carlos murdered. This act ends with a fan|ciful, but bomba&s;t &s;peech.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, we encounter the general, haunted with the imaginary gho&s;t of his murdered friend. Zanga comes on, and tells him, that his orders re&s;pecting Carlos has been &s;trictly fulfilled; this intelligence &s;omewhat awakens remor&s;e; however, having thus begun the work of blood, he determines to carry it on as far as his wife, and mentions the place he has appointed for this &s;acrifice to jealous rage. The Moor, view|ing his mi&s;chievous plan in &s;o thriving a &s;ituation, breathes out &s;ome ma&s;terly lines of emphatic exul|tation.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="336">Leonora is next di&s;covered &s;leeping in an arbour, the &s;ight of her occa&s;ions a tenderne&s;s in Alonzo's mind, which he expre&s;&s;es in an agreeable manner, but too florid and picture&s;que for the &s;tate of agi|tation he is in. At length, he works his pa&s;&s;ion up to the fatal act, and even lifts his dagger to give the blow, but is &s;topped by her waking: love here in|terpo&s;es, and checks his rage, which extends no further than the utterance of &s;ome incoherent &s;peeches; &s;he &s;ooths him, and aims at explanation, but in vain.</P>
<P>Going off, he drops his dagger, at &s;ight of &s;uch an object &s;he is &s;taggered, and, like a faithful wife, fears for her hu&s;band's &s;afety; however, when the bo&s;om-&s;nake Zanga hints to her, that her life &s;tands endangered from Alonzo's jealou&s;y, with the true &s;pirit of con&s;cious innocence, &s;he determines to vin|dicate her own honour from &s;o foul a charge; and to free him from a feeling, which &s;he can hardly &s;uppo&s;e him mean enough to indulge.</P>
<P>Alonzo returning, Zanga urges afre&s;h Leonora's guilt, but is &s;ent off with a churli&s;h reproof. When the lady re-enters, &s;he is acco&s;ted by her hu&s;band in terms of very &s;oft and tender re&s;pect: their con|ver&s;e, for &s;ome time, promi&s;es reunion, harmony and mutual &s;atisfaction; but, upon her producing the dagger, takes quite a different turn. He is thrown into fre&s;h agitation by &s;eeing the in&s;trument of his jealou&s;y, which Leonora perceiving, &s;he expre&s;&s;es her&s;elf in &s;uch terms as warm him into a direct ac|cu&s;ation of guilt: after &s;ome violent altercation, the pride of &s;lander ri&s;es &s;o high, that &s;he &s;tabs her|&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="337">This act of fatal extremity &s;trikes Alonzo's af|fection deeply; after apologizing for &s;uicide in plau&s;ible terms, &s;he is carried off, and Alonzo fol|lows, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t horrid doubts. Zan|ga now comes forward, bent on filling up the mea|&s;ure of his revenge, by the mo&s;t de&s;perate means; which, upon Alonzo's return, he puts in practice, by an open and triumphant declaration of his vil|lainy; this has the de&s;ired effect, and &s;uperadds &s;uch a weight of woe, that the unhappy victim of his implacable re&s;entment, faints under the load. At length, having with great, though fal&s;e dignity of &s;entiment, endeavoured to ju&s;tify his cruel and treacherous proceedings, Zanga attempts to kill him&s;elf, but is prevented by Alonzo, and delivered as a pri&s;oner to guards, who enter with Alvarez.</P>
<P>Upon hearing that Leonora is dead, the general puts a period to his own wretched exi&s;tence; this &s;trikes the Moor with remor&s;e, which he utters in very generous and forceable terms. When Zanga is carried to the fate his crimes de&s;erve, Alvarez concludes the piece, with &s;ome rhimes which we cannot greatly approve.</P>
<P>The REVENGE, upon a general view, exhibits indi&s;putable marks of a powerful genius: the ver|&s;ification is flowing and nervous; the &s;entiments noble and comprehen&s;ive; the moral, a warning again&s;t that hydra of calamities, jealou&s;y. Yet, if we &s;crutinize, we &s;hall find a barrenne&s;s of incident, a palling &s;amene&s;s in the &s;cenes, and a weari&s;ome length of laboured dialogue. There is al&s;o a mo&s;t di&s;advantageous and palpable &s;imilitude to OTHELLO.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="338">The characters are few, and of them only four de&s;erve any notice. Alonzo is introduced to our regard as a brave and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;oldier; yet, upon examination, we mu&s;t con&s;ider him as a weak or a wicked per&s;onage: the former undoubtedly he is, and he borders clo&s;e upon the latter, by fir&s;t &s;up|planting his friend in the bu&s;ine&s;s of love, and then authorizing his murder; though, as a jealous Spa|niard, with whom, as well as the Moors, revenge is virtue, he &s;tands excu&s;able.</P>
<P>In repre&s;entation, he requires exten&s;ive and va|riable powers; there are very difficult tran&s;itions in many pa&s;&s;ages, and he is a leading object for critical attention till his la&s;t &s;cene, where he falls off mo&s;t mi&s;erably.</P>
<P>Mr. RYAN was in voice and years, when we &s;aw him, very unfit for the love &s;cenes of this character; yet, in the jealou&s;y and di&s;traction, he &s;truck out con&s;iderable beauties. Mr. HAVARD looked the part better, and was more characteri&s;tic in the ten|der &s;cenes. Mr. REDDISH, though deficient in powers for the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned &s;peeches, has, we apprehend, more equality of merit, and is, upon the whole, more agreeable than his predece&s;&s;ors. Had Mr. GARRICK ever conde&s;cended to repre&s;ent the Spani&s;h general, he would, beyond doubt, have made him one of the greate&s;t parts on the &s;tage; whereas, wanting &s;uch incomparable abilities, he ever has been but a kind of foil to Zanga.</P>
<P>Carlos, though a very poetical character, is &s;adly in&s;ipid; Mr. ROSS did him more ju&s;tice than any other per&s;on we recollect. It was barbarous in the managers to load Mr. J. AICKIN with this part. In a proper &s;tile, we entertain a very favourable
<PB N="333" REF="339">
idea of this gentleman's &s;en&s;ibility; but, we are &s;orry to &s;ay, that his Don Carlos was a mo&s;t &s;omni|ferous exhibition: why might not the &s;weet &s;wain, Mr. CAUTHERLY, whine through this un&s;ea&s;oned lover? though, to confe&s;s truth, the matter would in that ca&s;e be very little mended.</P>
<P>Zanga is a fini&s;hed villain, with &s;ome greatne&s;s of mind: we do not know any character more fa|vourable to the actor; this is plainly evinced by con&s;idering that in a great variety of performers we have &s;een undertake it, every one has met and de|&s;erved con&s;iderable applau&s;e. Mr. QUIN, in the &s;oliloquies, and la&s;t &s;cene, acquitted him&s;elf with great ability, but wanted ea&s;e of in&s;inuation, and was heavy in the other parts. Mr. SHERIDAN, with powers va&s;tly inferior, was more in character upon the whole. Mr. HOLLAND was better than either, by mingling the merit of both, yet fell greatly &s;hort of Mr. MOSSOP, who mo&s;t certainly &s;tands in this part him&s;elf alone; as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and happily adapting an unequalled &s;pirit, extent and propriety of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Leonora has been rendered very agreeable by Mrs. BELLAMY, but we are inclined to prefer Mrs. BADDELY.</P>
<P>Auditors and readers, of florid conceptions, will be entertained with this play, both on the &s;tage and in the clo&s;et; however, we are inclined rather to prai&s;e it as a poem than a tragedy.</P>

<P>When Frankly comes on, a mo&s;t indelicate idea is rai&s;ed by his remark upon Ranger's looking &s;adly; we wi&s;h his que&s;tion and the an&s;wer totally ex|punged. The remaining part of this &s;cene is filled up with very agreeable conver&s;ation, upon the &s;ub|ject of gallantry and the fair &s;ex; by which each di&s;covers the bent of his own mind, with re&s;pect to the ladies. The vi&s;it is a mere chit-chat one, and &s;eems to have no other meaning than opening the characters.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="341">In the following &s;cene, we meet Mrs. Strictland and Jacintha, by whom we are made acquainted with Clarinda; and that Cupid's arrow has touched her heart, in favour of a young fellow &s;he danced with at Bath. We al&s;o receive a hint of Mr. Strictland's gloomy &s;tate of mind. When that gen|tleman makes his appearance, we find, that as guar|dian to Jacintha, he has received a letter from Bel|lamy, &s;oliciting his con&s;ent to marry that lady; upon which &s;ubject he makes &s;ome churli&s;h re|marks, but at la&s;t con&s;ents to &s;ee the lover.</P>
<P>After Jacintha goes off, Strictland opens at large his &s;u&s;picious temper, by expre&s;&s;ing di&s;like to Cla|rinda, as a companion for his wife. His expre&s;&s;ions are full of ill nature and a&s;perity, in&s;omuch, that the lady bur&s;t into tears, which &s;often him into a faint, aukward kind of an apology, with which he retires, leaving Mrs. Strictland in doubt of his mo|tives for &s;uch behaviour, and &s;urprize at the foun|dation of them.</P>
<P>We are now carried into the Park, where Frank|ly and Bellamy pre&s;ent them&s;elves, the former di&s;|clo&s;ing to his friend the pa&s;&s;ion he has conceived for an unknown lady; his account of the matter is plea&s;ant and &s;pirited. When Jack Meggot comes on, the &s;ubject gives way to his frothy, rhap&s;odical prattle: which, with very little meaning, is tolera|bly plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>After the butterfly of fa&s;hion runs in pur&s;uit of one of his favourite dilettanti, Frankly gives a fa|vourable idea of his heart, though we cannot enter|tain any re&s;pect for his head. Our author has in the following pa&s;&s;age, we apprehend, been guilty of unpardonable di&s;re&s;pect to the fair &s;ex&mdash;"There is
<PB N="336" REF="342">
a heart, <HI>even</HI> in a woman's brea&s;t, that is worth the purcha&s;e," why the emphatic word <HI>even,</HI> as if worth and generous feelings were more rare to be met with in the female, than the male &s;ex. A mo&s;t il|liberal, as well as fal&s;e idea.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t act ends with Frankly's determining to &s;earch out, if po&s;&s;ible, his fair incognita. At the beginning of the &s;econd, three ladies pre&s;ent them|&s;elves, Clarinda, Jacintha and Mrs. Strictland; the former being taxed with her Bath partner, &s;he throws out &s;ome &s;prightly ob&s;ervations upon gal|lants, and the manner of treating them. Jacintha's prudent and &s;ettled notions of love are well op|po&s;ed to Clarinda's levity; &s;he having met with a worthy and agreeable man, has given him unre|&s;erved po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart. Mrs. Strictland's unhappy &s;ituation being mentioned, the gay lady re|commends re&s;i&s;tive behaviour, which the &s;en&s;ible wife declines. To remove Strictland's unea&s;y ap|prehen&s;ions, Clarinda goes off, with a re&s;olution of leaving his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>After two or three &s;peeches, &s;he returns in a great flurry of &s;pirits, having met her admirer; the trick of letting him know where &s;he lives is natural: a kind of pantomime pur&s;uit en&s;ues, till, at length, Frankly having hou&s;ed her, takes the advantage of an open door, and obtains a &s;hort conference with her, in which he &s;peaks plainly as to the pa&s;&s;ion he has conceived for her.</P>
<P>Her diffidence is delicate, and the lover makes no further progre&s;s than receiving information, that he will find or hear of her at Mr. Strictland's hou&s;e. After he goes off, Clarinda makes an open confe&s;&s;ion to Mrs. Strictland of her captivated
<PB N="337" REF="343">
&s;tate. Mr. Strictland, in &s;oliloquy, expre&s;&s;es much unea&s;ine&s;s at the vi&s;itors and me&s;&s;ages which come to Clarinda, as &s;uppo&s;ing his wife may have &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter concern in them. Seeing Lucetta, his wife's waiting-woman, he determines to examine her; but thinking &s;he may deceive him, calls for Te&s;ter, who&s;e &s;implicity he thinks may be more &s;afely tru&s;ted than the chambermaid's cunning; however, upon con&s;ideration, he deems him too weak and fallible an object for confidence to re&s;t upon, therefore again calls for Lucetta, to whom he addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with &s;uch whim&s;ical caution, that &s;he very artfully pretends to apprehend an attack upon her virtue; this, and her laughing at his per|plexity, increa&s;es it &s;o much, that he hurries her off; and makes a very forceable remark on the tor|menting &s;ituation of his own mind, &s;o painfully en|&s;laved by &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>From Bellamy and Jack Meggot, in the next &s;cene, we learn, that if Jacintha, who has determined to elope, effects her purpo&s;e, &s;he is to be lodged at Jack's hou&s;e. Frankly enters to them, on the wings of tran&s;port, at having found his Perdita; of whom, however, he can give no further account, than that he has &s;een and obtained leave to vi&s;it her again.</P>
<P>When Jack Meggot retires, Bellamy acknow|ledges him&s;elf in the li&s;t of lovers: plea&s;ed with their &s;ympathetic feelings, Frankly and he embrace, a circum&s;tance merely introduced for Ranger to je&s;t upon their in&s;ipid &s;ituation. His entrance ra|ther interrupts their amorous ideas, as deeming him a heretic in love affairs; however, he delivers a let|ter from Jacintha to Bellamy, which informs the
<PB N="338" REF="344">
audience that &s;he has planned her elopement. Ranger's advice of carrying her to a bagnio, howe|ver &s;mart, is rather gro&s;s.</P>
<P>When Bellamy claims Ranger's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he calls him&s;elf a <HI>damnable</HI> unlucky fellow, we wi&s;h he had found another epithet, for though it may be natural enough in a Covent Garden buck, it is re|prehen&s;ible on the &s;tage. Buckle, Bellamy's &s;er|vant, informs his ma&s;ter that Jacintha, having no other means of e&s;cape, intends to de&s;cend from her chamber-window by a ladder of ropes, and that &s;he is to be di&s;gui&s;ed in boy's cloaths: matters thus &s;ettled, the &s;econd act concludes.</P>
<P>Bellamy, di&s;gui&s;ed in a chairman's coat, begins the third act, before Strictland's hou&s;e, to which &s;pot al&s;o love has conveyed Frankly. Lucetta, from below, informs Jacintha at the window, that &s;he mu&s;t be very cautious, as her guardian is up and on the watch. Frankly, from what he imperfectly hears and &s;ees, imagines that &s;ome intrigue is going forward, therefore re&s;olves to li&s;ten. While he is clo&s;ely attending Jacintha's motions, Clarinda en|ters, returning from a whi&s;t party, and overhears &s;ome conver&s;ation between them. Jacintha, &s;up|po&s;ing it is Bellamy, throws down the rope ladder; ju&s;t as &s;he is going to de&s;cend, Lucetta informs her that &s;he may come down the back &s;tairs; this change of &s;ituations gives Clarinda an opportunity of detecting, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;es, her faithle&s;s &s;park. He endeavours to exculpate him&s;elf, but &s;he flounces into the hou&s;e without affording him an idea of forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Here Bellamy enters, and &s;eeing a man under his mi&s;tre&s;s's window, entertains jealous apprehen&s;ions
<PB N="339" REF="345">
of rival&s;hip. Jacintha, in the hurry of her e&s;cape, runs into Frankly's arms&mdash;How he immediately di&s;covers her to be a woman is not obvious. Bel|lamy's alarm increa&s;es, and he gives the &s;uppo&s;ed rival an oblique challenge. No &s;ooner are the&s;e characters off the &s;tage, than Strictland appears, in pur&s;uit of his ward. To him &s;ucceeds Ranger, who having more liquor than prudence in his head, &s;eems eager to have what he calls a frolic.</P>
<P>Reeling along, he encounters the rope ladder, and in the flow of &s;pirits determines to mount it. Up|on reaching the window, he &s;pies an agreeable wo|man, and very mode&s;tly re&s;olves to follow, deter|mining to make an amorous attack upon her. Mrs. Strictland and Lucetta next appear; from &s;ome words which the maid drops, Ranger di&s;covers that the lady's hu&s;band is jealous, and from that cir|cum&s;tance draws favourable hopes re&s;pecting his own de&s;ign upon her; when Lucetta, for deliver|ing her &s;entiments rather too freely, is ordered to quit the room, our gallant templar pre&s;ents him&s;elf, in a manner not very delicate. His purpo&s;e thro' the whole &s;cene is culpably licentious, and the lady's behaviour, as we think, much too tame for &s;uch an unpardonable intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>Strictland's approach occa&s;ions Ranger to retreat precipitately; in his hurry he inadvertently drops his hat; it appears, that Strictland has recovered Ja|cintha, and &s;he is brought on as his pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Having &s;harply reproved the young lady for her adventurous elopement, Strictland &s;trikes his foot again&s;t Ranger's hat, which, in his hurry, that gal|lant had dropped. Such an object found in a wife's dre&s;&s;ing room, might naturally alarm a man
<PB N="340" REF="346">
le&s;s tainted with &s;u&s;picion. Mrs. Strictland, bold in her own innocence, though with &s;uch an unfa|vourable circum&s;tance again&s;t her, endeavours, with becoming &s;pirit, to &s;et her precipitate lord and ma&s;ter right; who cannot, however, be reduced to any degree of rea&s;on, till wrought upon by a fine&s;&s;e which Lucetta &s;ugge&s;ts, that of Jacintha's owning the hat.</P>
<P>This turn is plea&s;ant enough, and works the de|&s;ired effect. A reconciliation, at lea&s;t an aukward, temporary one, takes place between the married couple; but the di&s;appointed &s;ingle lady is &s;ent clo&s;e pri&s;oner to her chamber, with a declaration from her guardian, that in the morning &s;he mu&s;t be removed to the country.</P>
<P>The &s;cene being changed, Ranger comes for|ward, groping his way in a dark chamber, bent upon &s;eeking out game: Jacintha enters with a candle, whom, from appearance, he takes to be a boy; however, by &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions &s;he drops in &s;o|liloquy, he di&s;covers his mi&s;take, and as &s;he is going to attempt a &s;econd e&s;cape, by means of the ladder of ropes, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;es is &s;till at the window, he pre&s;ents him&s;elf: with humorous freedom he pays his devoirs in &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing terms, that, being afraid, on Mrs. Strictland's account, to cry out, &s;he is at length obliged to mention Bellamy's name; this &s;trikes Ranger, who plays her off agreeably, concerning her letter, which mentioned the plan of elopement.</P>
<P>Perceiving hereby that Ranger is in her lover's confidence, &s;he readily agrees to his propo&s;al of helping her from confinement, and conducting her to the man of her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="347">Act the fourth begins with Bellamy and Frank|ly, the former rating the latter, as being, though without de&s;ign, the occa&s;ion of his lo&s;ing Jacintha. While he is in this critical &s;tate of temper, Lucetta comes in great confu&s;ion to enquire for Jacintha; he knowing nothing about her, the maid remarks, that Clarinda &s;uppo&s;es her to be gone off with one Frankly. On this information Bellamy &s;ends Lu|cetta to &s;earch for the lo&s;t fair one, and &s;eeing a confu&s;ion in Frankly's face, which might very na|turally ari&s;e in &s;uch a ca&s;e, he draws, demanding what is called gentleman's &s;atisfaction for the &s;up|po&s;ed injury.</P>
<P>Here Ranger opportunely enters, and Iudicrou&s;ly remarks, that they manife&s;t a &s;trange contrariety of behaviour&mdash;One moment hugging each other, and the next tilting. In the account he gives of his la&s;t night's adventure, &s;ome very plea&s;ant mi&s;appre|hen&s;ions ari&s;e, which bring on the alternate re&s;ent|ment of Bellamy and Frankly, again&s;t their merry friend; who de&s;ignedly plays upon them the game of cro&s;s purpo&s;es, till he is both threatened and wheedled to give an explanation that may ea&s;e their anxiety.</P>
<P>This, however, he refers to Jack Meggot, which the &s;prightly prattle enters upon immediately, by informing them that Jacintha is at his hou&s;e. This ea&s;es Bellamy's painful feelings, and Frankly's new rai&s;ed jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;ides by being told, that the other lady Ranger had encountered is a wife. Each hav|ing mentioned a particular de&s;tination, the four gen|tlemen go off to make way for Mrs. Strictland and Clarinda.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="348">The latter, we perceive, is preparing for a &s;peedy removal from Mr. Strictland's hou&s;e: he appears, and receives ironical, cold thanks, for the civilities &s;he has received from him. Having conducted her off, he re-enters, expre&s;&s;es &s;atisfaction at her depar|ture, and then leads his wife off al&s;o.</P>
<P>Lucetta being left alone, &s;tates to her&s;elf the &s;u&s;|picious &s;ituation of affairs, and &s;eems, from the hat, to think her mi&s;tre&s;s guilty. While &s;he is thus me|ditating, Frankly comes, de&s;iring to &s;peak with Cla|rinda; being informed that &s;he has left the hou&s;e, with warm per&s;ua&s;ion, and a golden bribe, &s;he pro|mi&s;es to deliver a letter to her.</P>
<P>Strictland, alarmed by hearing a knock at the door, and a man's voice, li&s;tens. When Frankly goes off, he &s;teals behind Lucetta, and &s;natches the epi&s;tle out of her hand; reads it, and finding an apology for an un&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it, he concludes it to be from the owner of the hat to his wife; from mention of a companion at Bath, he &s;uppo&s;es Cla|rinda to be an acce&s;&s;ary. His jealous ideas thus confirmed, he &s;torms at Lucetta, who de&s;ires him to look at the cover of the letter, a point his impa|tience had neglected.</P>
<P>By this he finds that it is directed to Clarinda: the maid, ju&s;tly reproving his folly, he concludes that they are all confederates, that his wife is in|di&s;putably guilty, and that in con&s;equence thereof, a po&s;itive &s;eparation mu&s;t take place.</P>
<P>Clarinda next appears, cro&s;&s;ing the &s;tage in a chair, and goes into a lodging hou&s;e: Ranger pur&s;ues her, and, by bribing the chairman, gains free acce&s;s. The lady di&s;covers who he is, and a&s;ks for a ma&s;k, under which &s;he re&s;olves to try her mad-cap cou&s;in.
<PB N="343" REF="349">
Upon his approach, he &s;uppo&s;es her to be a lady of ea&s;y virtue, and as &s;uch, though with delicacy, makes his attack in very &s;lattering terms, till being wrought up to a particular degree of rapture, &s;he di&s;clo&s;es her face, and throws him into a laughable confu&s;ion; however, he turns it off with agreeable addre&s;s, profe&s;&s;ing a knowledge of her, though di&s;|gui&s;ed.</P>
<P>In their conver&s;ation Jacintha is mentioned, and Clarinda &s;peaks of the hat dropped in Mrs. Strict|land's chamber; this leads to a di&s;covery which Ranger avails him&s;elf of, that his cou&s;in is Frankly's mi&s;tre&s;s. After receiving from her a kind of cate|chetical admonition, by way of retaliation, he a|larms her with a fictitious incident of Frankly's being wounded.</P>
<P>Here, by &s;hewing palpable concern for her lover, &s;he convinces Ranger of her regard, and he teizes her pretty hand&s;omely; however, &s;he at la&s;t gets rid of him, and then determines upon enquiring fur|ther into the truth of &s;o intere&s;ting a circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, we &s;ee Strictland at one end of a table writing, and his wife at the other end weeping; the purport of his letter is to acquaint Mrs. Strictland's brother in the country what a &s;i&s;ter he is like to receive; the thoughts of being &s;o criminated affect her deeply. Hearing two &s;oft taps at the door, her &s;u&s;picious hu&s;band &s;tarts, and thinks to make &s;ome di&s;covery again&s;t her: upon opening the door, he &s;ees Te&s;ter, and enraged at his di&s;appointment, &s;trikes the unde&s;igning &s;im|pleton, who, by way of vindication, declares, that his mi&s;tre&s;s had ordered him never to come in with|out knocking; this is con&s;idered as a fre&s;h corrobo|ration
<PB N="344" REF="350">
of guilt. Upon reading a letter from Bel|lamy and his bride Jacintha, he determines upon going to Jack Meggot's, where an ecclairci&s;&s;ement is promi&s;ed, though he &s;uppo&s;es all the parties com|bined to deceive him.</P>
<P>Soon after he goes off, Lucetta comes on, and acquaints Mrs. Strictland, that Mrs. Bellamy de&s;ires her appearance al&s;o at Mr. Meggot's, particularly as the young gentleman, Ranger, who was &s;o un|expectedly in her room the night before, is to be at the general rendezvous. We next meet Frankly, Ranger, Bellamy and Jacintha; the former being informed that Clarinda is not only a lady of fortune and Ranger's cou&s;in, but that &s;he loves him, ex|pre&s;&s;es warm &s;atisfaction. In a &s;hort time the lady appears; not &s;eeing Frankly, her fears of his being wounded increa&s;e; a concern which &s;he cannot hide is plea&s;antly rallied by the other characters: at length the men retire.</P>
<P>When the women are alone, Jacintha, with much formality of countenance and phra&s;e, plays upon her friend's feelings, but immediately relieves them, by declaring, that her gallant has no wounds but tho&s;e of love; &s;he then calls Mr. Frankly from his concealment, and leaves the enamoured pair to an explanation of their own concerns.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort tete-a-tete, the lover makes clo&s;e ap|proaches, while the lady &s;hews a delicate, but not an unkind re&s;i&s;tance. When they are both puzzled what to &s;ay, Ranger appears, and laughingly points out the aukwardne&s;s of &s;peechle&s;s love: he then comes to the deci&s;ive point of &s;ettling matters; at once a&s;ks his cou&s;in if &s;he has not given con&s;ent to make her lover happy, which que&s;tion not being
<PB N="345" REF="351">
an&s;wered &s;atisfactorily, he mentions the letter Mr. Strictland had intercepted, and goes off to bring proof of what he a&s;&s;erts.</P>
<P>When he is gone, Frankly confe&s;&s;es having given &s;uch a letter to Lucetta: matters now take a very tender turn, when they are again interrupted by the entrance of Ranger, Strictland, Bellamy, Jacintha, and Jack Meggot. Mr. Strictland being promi&s;ed &s;atisfaction in the affair of the letter, &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to entertain a more favourable turn of mind. Cla|rinda, being per&s;uaded that Mrs. Strictland's future happine&s;s, in a great mea&s;ure, depends on her agree|ing to Frankly's &s;olicitations, acquie&s;ces. Strictland &s;eeing her with the very per&s;on who&s;e letter he had &s;topped, &s;eems to apprehend his folly; and, upon Frankly's openly declaring the matter, confe&s;&s;es his error.</P>
<P>Ranger here takes a plea&s;ant advantage of the &s;tate of things to ha&s;ten Clarinda's marriage, by telling Strictland not to tru&s;t their declaration, un|le&s;s confirmed by a po&s;itive match; this being in|&s;i&s;ted on, the point is &s;ettled agreeably to all parties. Seeing Mrs. Strictland approach, Ranger, con&s;cious of his own cen&s;urable indi&s;cretion, takes alarm: the injured wife, perceiving her occa&s;ional gallant, points him out to Strictland, as the per&s;on who was in her chamber the night before; to prevent &s;erious re&s;entment he recapitulates his adventure, and in the relation gives Strictland a &s;evere reproof for his jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>Finding conviction fla&s;h upon him from all &s;ides, the reformed hu&s;band encounters his jealou&s;y, and is reconciled to his wife with tears of joy. All matters being thus agreeably di&s;po&s;ed, Ranger con|cludes
<PB N="346" REF="352">
the piece with a &s;en&s;ible compliment to ma|trimony, when attended with &s;en&s;e and virtue.</P>
<P>No play has appeared with greater eclat for many years than the SUSPICIOUS HUSBAND did at its fir&s;t appearance, nor is any comedy more likely to live from an uncommon vivacity of dialogue, variety and plea&s;antry of incidents. There are &s;ome improba|bilities in the plot, which occur in the third act, but they are rather plea&s;ing than offen&s;ive, and the de|&s;ign is entertaining, though trifling.</P>
<P>Wit there is none and very little &s;entiment, yet na|ture need not be a&s;hamed of our author's delinea|tion, who has neither heightened her charms, nor caricatured her defects.</P>
<P>The denouement is mo&s;t &s;atisfactorily wrought up; the circum&s;tances are &s;piritedly and convictive|ly explained; as to the characters, let them &s;peak for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Strictland, who is confe&s;&s;edly drawn from JOHN|SON's Kitely, wants much of that nervous beauty which appears in the original, yet is not without merit; his jealou&s;y is well de&s;cribed, and his &s;itua|tions properly imagined; his reformation is brought about by very powerful per&s;ua&s;ive; and, at the cata&s;trophe, we have great rea&s;on to believe he is cured of his folly.</P>
<P>To perform this part requires judgment and ex|pre&s;&s;ion; it has never been better done than by Mr. BRIDGEWATER, Mr. SPARKS, notwith&s;tanding we only place him &s;econd, bu&s;tled through the jea|lou&s;y very well; his fault was aiming at more than is nece&s;&s;ary. Mr. BERRY, and the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, Mr. LOVE, got to the other extreme, a mo&s;t drow|&s;ing in&s;ipidity.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="353">Ranger is a very plea&s;ant and plau&s;ible rake, who commits many culpable actions, but without any fundamental, ill de&s;ign; his clambering into a gen|tleman's hou&s;e at midnight, is a very indi&s;creet joke; but to ballance his foibles, he &s;eems to have friend|&s;hip, genero&s;ity and honour, at the bottom.</P>
<P>Mr. GARRICK was his faithful, excellent repre|&s;entative; the volatile humour of the incon&s;iderate templar, was admirably de&s;cribed by this mo&s;t meta|morpho&s;able actor; in&s;omuch, that we well remember &s;everal young fellows, who, having more &s;pirit than &s;en&s;e, attempted to imitate his Ranger in real life, for which both their bones and pockets &s;uffered &s;martly.</P>
<P>Doctor HOADLY's jokes would not do retailed in &s;uch a manner; we laugh at tran&s;actions upon the &s;tage, which would be very di&s;plea&s;ing at home. Mr. LEE had undoubted merit in Ranger, but wanted that voluble &s;pirit which places Mr. KING, in our opinion, next to Mr. GARRICK, and not far behind him. Mr. DYER has made &s;everal inade|quate efforts, but for a London theatre has always appeared more like the &s;ketch of a character than a real one. Would you, kind reader, believe &s;o gro&s;s an improbability, as that Mr. SHERIDAN, not hav|ing the fear of murder before his eyes, &s;hould, with more than &s;avage barbarity, mutilate poor Ranger? yet, true it is: upon this occa&s;ion, as well as many others, we were induced to wi&s;h, that, <HI>as an actor,</HI> he had &s;tudied that excellent admonition, KNOW THYSELF; a maxim quite as e&s;&s;ential to public as private life, yet as little attended to in the former as the latter.</P>
<P>Frankly is a gay young fellow, &s;u&s;ceptible of the tender pa&s;&s;ions; though he cannot obtain &s;uch ap|plau&s;e
<PB N="348" REF="354">
and attention as Ranger, he is neverthele&s;s more re&s;pectable as a man; he loves one object, and pur&s;ues her only. His &s;ituations, though not very critical, are yet well di&s;po&s;ed; and though he can never add much to a performer's reputation, yet, if there are adequate abilities, he wont injure them.</P>
<P>Mr. RYAN was the fir&s;t repre&s;entative we recol|lect of this character, and had a con&s;iderable &s;hare of &s;prightly ea&s;e; but age and figure were both a|gain&s;t him. Mr. HAVARD was genteel, but want|ed life. Mr. PALMER had &s;ufficient &s;pirit, but was rather coxcomical. As to Mr. JEFFERSON, we think the part above his cut.</P>
<P>Bellamy is a &s;ober, regular gallant; and we think he is ju&s;t as well &s;upported by Mr. PACKER, as by any body el&s;e. Jack Meggot was mo&s;t happy with Mr. WOODWARD; and has no manner of rea&s;on to complain of Mr. DODD. Mr. VAUGHAN's &s;imple Te&s;ter cannot be mended.</P>
<P>Mrs. Strictland is an agreeable picture of what a wife &s;hould be, only we think her patience and con|de&s;cen&s;ion are carried rather too far: there is a commendable degree of pliancy in dome&s;tic di&s;|putes, which often prevents extremities; but, in this character, there is a cen&s;urable tamene&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. ELMY, who had a peculiar grace and hap|pine&s;s in making characters con&s;picuous, which &s;carce any other actre&s;s could gain attention to, &s;up|ported the ta&s;k of playing this part, for &s;uch it really is, with plea&s;ing ability. Mrs. PALMER, though not equal to her predece&s;&s;or, was extremely amiable in this gentle wife; and we are not at all di&s;plea&s;ed to find her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mrs. W. BARRY.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="355">Clarinda we may perceive to be an object of the author's particular regard; &s;he is furni&s;hed with a large fund of &s;pirits, and a &s;light da&s;h of the co|quette; yet capable of a &s;ettled, &s;incere pa&s;&s;ion, without any tendency to imprudent actions. She likes to rally, and has a plea&s;ant flow of expre&s;&s;ion, but never &s;acrifices delicacy at the &s;hrine of licen|tious wit.</P>
<P>Mrs. WOFFINGTON was plea&s;ant in Clarinda, but &s;tiffened her too much with the affectation, both in deportment and delivery, of a fine lady. Mrs. PRITCHARD, by equalling her excellence, and a|voiding her faults, took the lead con&s;iderably; there was a freedom and fire of expre&s;&s;ion in her performance, that we have never &s;een &s;urpa&s;&s;ed. Mi&s;s HAUGHTON was by no means unentertaining, yet far below either of the&s;e ladies; and Mi&s;s POPE, at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of compari&s;on, makes but a very moderate &s;hift.</P>
<P>Jacintha, in the circum&s;tance of her elopement, &s;hews more of a romantic, adventurous di&s;po&s;ition, than prudence; however, &s;he has ardent love on one &s;ide, and confinement on the other, to plead her excu&s;e; and the mo&s;t rigid ob&s;erver mu&s;t be plea&s;ed that &s;he effects her e&s;cape. When Mrs. WIL|LOUGHBY played this part, &s;ome years &s;ince, &s;he gave us great plea&s;ure, though an actre&s;s little known, and by &s;ew now remembered; by giving her the pre|ference, we dont mean to deprive Mrs. JEFFERIES of the prai&s;e &s;he de&s;erves.</P>
<P>Lucetta is a &s;hort, unimportant chambermaid, yet well drawn, and u&s;eful to the play; Mrs. GREEN made every line of her tell; but, for Mrs. LOVE&mdash;oh! oh! oh!</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="356">We are &s;orry, after a &s;erious, candid enquiry, into the nature and tendency of this play, to condemn &s;o agreeable a piece of entertainment.

Will it re&s;t neuter, and leave the &s;u&s;ceptible mind no wor&s;e than it finds it? we are apprehen&s;ive, no.

<HEAD>King HENRY the Fifth. An Hi&s;torical TRAGEDY: SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;ome where ob&s;erved, in re&s;pect of our author, that he not only &s;ucce&s;sfully availed him&s;elf of hi&s;torical &s;ubjects in general, but, with peculiar addre&s;s, turned to advantage, many re|markable characters and tran&s;actions of his own country; which from a very natural and commend|able partiality to our native &s;oil, prove particularly intere&s;ting to Briti&s;h audiences.</P>
<P>The poet's idea of that unexpectedly great mo|narch the fifth Henry, may be collected from his prologue to this play; which, not only for the e&s;|&s;ential connection, but its &s;ublimity, &s;hould always be &s;poken; it is a noble apology for the gro&s;s tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es upon time and place, which &s;o often occur to &s;hock nice and rigid critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Ely and the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury open this play, like true churchmen who love to hold fa&s;t temporalities, they con&s;ult how to ward off a parliamentary attack upon a con&s;iderable part of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; they &s;eem happy in having the king of their &s;ide, of who&s;e reformation, from the di&s;graceful follies of his youth, they give a very fa|vourable account; the royal favour &s;eems to have been purcha&s;ed by a politic propo&s;al of Canterbu|ry's, to furni&s;h the king with a larger voluntary contribution than ever had been given by the cler|gy, to his predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358">In the &s;econd &s;cene we meet King Henry, &s;ur|rounded by &s;everal noblemen; upon the Archbi|&s;hop's entrance, his maje&s;ty a&s;ks his opinion, rela|tive to the &s;alique law of France; whether it &s;hould or &s;hould not affect the Engli&s;h claims upon that kingdom; this propo&s;ition Canterbury an&s;wers with nice political di&s;tinctions, and decides in fa|vour of England.</P>
<P>How the author could &s;uppo&s;e any actor could gain attention through &s;o long, laborious and in|tricate a &s;peech, we know not: the prelate &s;trong|ly urging war, is backed by the other nobles, when Henry takes occa&s;ion to utter his apprehen&s;ion that the Scots may take a dangerous advantage of fo|reign ho&s;tilities; this point is overuled by his coun|&s;ellors, upon which the king orders the amba&s;&s;ador of France to be called in.</P>
<P>During his audience, we perceive the French|man to be very pert, particularly in his mention of the ton of tennis balls, &s;ent by the Dauphin as an ironical equivalent for the territories claimed by England; the monarch's reply is pregnant with truly royal &s;pirit, and becomingly denounces the cha&s;ti&s;ement of France for &s;uch pre&s;umtuous in&s;o|lence; the Amba&s;&s;ador being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, Henry urges &s;peedy, vigorous preparation for the expediti|on; declaring that he will return the Dauphin's com|pliment at his father's door.</P>
<P>In the &s;ucceeding &s;cene, we find a &s;trange tran&s;i|tion of characters; from the highe&s;t rank in life, we are immediately popped amid&s;t the &s;cum of the earth, Nim and Bardolph; we find, that the for|mer has had &s;ome quarrel with Ancient Pi&s;tol, which the latter wants to make up between them.
<PB N="353" REF="359">
They are &s;oon joined by the &s;waggering blade and Ho&s;te&s;s Quickly; the quarrel is renewed, and a conver&s;ation in the fla&s;h &s;tile en&s;ues.</P>
<P>It is painful to think that &s;uch low, unintelligible jargon, &s;hould have been obtruded upon a &s;erious piece. The Ho&s;te&s;s gives them an intimation, that their old leader, Sir John Fal&s;taff, is at the point of death, and de&s;ires them to vi&s;it him.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act we meet a chorus, which never &s;hould be omitted; the tale of connexion is fine, and expre&s;&s;ed with nervous elegance. Exeter, Bedford and We&s;tmoreland, come forward, mentioning &s;ome traitors who have been di&s;covered. The king, upon his entrance, ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the culprits, in very gentle terms, de&s;iring their opinion concerning the expedition: from this he leads them on to warm profe&s;&s;ions of loyalty; at length, giving each a paper, they per|ceive their detection, and cannot conceal their con|fu&s;ion; but in&s;tantaneou&s;ly acknowledge their guilt, and &s;ue for mercy, which the king, upon their own principles, very ju&s;tly refu&s;es; for having &s;ome &s;peeches before propo&s;ed pardoning a man, who, in heat of liquor, had &s;poken di&s;re&s;pectfully of his maje&s;ty, the&s;e con&s;cious villains expre&s;&s;ed di&s;appro|bation of &s;uch royal lenity.</P>
<P>After recapitulating in a ma&s;terly, but rather too minute a manner, their ingratitude and treache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> he delivers them over to the cour&s;e of law, and, with great humanity, prays for their acquittal. They are formally arre&s;ted by Exeter, and be|have with becoming contrition: they are borne to their fate, and Henry goes off with a &s;pirited re&s;o|lution
<PB N="354" REF="360">
of &s;eating him&s;elf on the throne of France, or falling in the bold attempt.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene we are placed among&s;t the raga|muffins, from whom we learn, that Fal&s;taff is no more: the Ho&s;te&s;s's de&s;cription of his final exit is ma&s;terly; and, we doubt not, all lovers of the fat knight, feel, at this pa&s;&s;age, &s;ome regret for the lo&s;s of him. We are inclined to wi&s;h that all his followers, who could only be &s;ufferable through their connexion with him, had tripped off the &s;tage of life al&s;o; but, as the author has cho&s;en to retain them, we mu&s;t compound for their company, how|ever irk&s;ome; e&s;pecially as they follow the king to France.</P>
<P>The grand monarch and his &s;on, the Dauphin, next appear, conferring with the Duke of Burgun|dy and Con&s;table, concerning the Engli&s;h inva&s;ion. Henry's character is lightly treated by the volatile Dauphin, who&s;e opinion is controverted by the peers; and even the French king &s;eems to think him formidable, as having &s;prung from that victo|rious &s;tock which &s;hook the power of France, at the memorable, fatal battle of Cre&s;&s;y. A me&s;&s;enger announcing the approach of amba&s;&s;adors from Eng|land, they are admitted to an immediate audience.</P>
<P>Exeter, on the part of his royal ma&s;ter, plainly and directly urges a renunciation of the French crown, in favour of Henry, under claim of his illu&s;trious ance&s;tor, Edward the Third; denouncing warlike compul&s;ion in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. The Dauphin a&s;k|ing what reply the Engli&s;h monarch has &s;ent to his me&s;&s;age, receives threats of cha&s;ti&s;ement. The French king, though &s;o roughly attacked, tamely
<PB N="355" REF="361">
promi&s;es an an&s;wer on the following day; and thus with the conference, ends the &s;econd act.</P>
<P>Here again we meet with a very e&s;&s;ential, becau&s;e explanatory and connective chorus; after which King Henry appears before the gates of Harfleur, where he has begun ho&s;tilities; the propo&s;als from France not being equal to his va&s;t ideas. His ad|dre&s;s to the a&s;&s;ailants is truly heroic, and worthy a royal character, rou&s;ed to vindictive mea&s;ures. He leads them on to the a&s;&s;ault with becoming dignity and re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Here a &s;cene follows, which is a &s;trange and tri|fling intru&s;ion upon the &s;erious circum&s;tances of affairs. Three captains, Scotch, Wel&s;h and Iri&s;h, are introduced; the two la&s;t enter into a di&s;pute of &s;ome humour, though a very un&s;ea&s;onable one, con|cerning di&s;cipline. Hearing a parley &s;ounded, they go off, and Henry appears again before the gates; declaring, that he will no longer be trifled with, by the governor of Harfleur; but, on refu&s;al of &s;urrender, will &s;acrifice the town to his ju&s;t re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The governor, de&s;pairing of &s;uccour, yields, and the victorious monarch enters his new conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Catherine, a French prince&s;s of France, is next introduced, endeavouring to learn &s;ome Engli&s;h words; &s;ure there never was a more trifling and &s;u|per&s;tuous &s;cene written. The French king, with his &s;on, and &s;everal nobles, are now brought for|ward, de&s;canting on the Engli&s;h &s;pirit. Touched with &s;hame at the unchecked approaches of &s;o daring a &s;oe, the monarch gives orders for a &s;udden and vigorous oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We next meet Gower, an officer, and the Wel&s;h captain, Fluellin; who remarks, that a per&s;on of little note, Ancient Pi&s;tol, has &s;hewed him&s;elf a man
<PB N="356" REF="362">
of &s;pirit: the Ancient immediately appears, and &s;olicits the Wel&s;hman's interpo&s;ition to &s;ave Bar|dolph, who has committed a robbery. The Cambo|briton di&s;dains &s;uch an office, and declares, he would not, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, &s;eek favour for a brother. This irritates Pi&s;tol, who goes off in a violent huff.</P>
<P>Gower explains his character to Fluellin, who, it appears, had no proof of his bravery, but his own boa&s;ting. Upon this di&s;covery, and his contemp|tuous words, the Wel&s;hman determines to watch an opportunity of putting him to the te&s;t. Here Hen|ry enters, and is addre&s;&s;ed by the captain, with &s;ome compliments upon the Duke of Exeter's martial abilities. Upon his mentioning Bardolph's &s;itua|tion, the king properly declares, that &s;uch per&s;ons are fit objects of puni&s;hment; and declares again&s;t all exerci&s;e of cruelty and rapine, though in an ene|my's country.</P>
<P>Mountjoy, as amba&s;&s;ador from the French king, enters, and, in an addre&s;s of con&s;iderable &s;pirit, de|livers his ma&s;ter's defiance. Henry mentions the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, &s;ickly &s;tate of his army; yet, with an exalted re&s;olution, declares his purpo&s;e to advance to Calais, and his determination, if oppo&s;ed, to fight his way.</P>
<P>We do not approve the national reflections thrown out by the king in this &s;cene; they are uncha|racteri&s;tic, both as to his under&s;tanding and &s;tation; the &s;um total of this audience is, that he will neither &s;eek nor &s;hun a battle. It appears, that the Engli&s;h monarch is reduced to a very tickli&s;h and perilous &s;ituation, which however no way appalls his mighty heart.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="363">The Dauphin, and peers of France, next exhibit them&s;elves; between whom a mo&s;t trifling conver|&s;ation, upon the merit of hor&s;es, en&s;ues. When the prince goes off, his character is freely and &s;lightly handled by one of the lords. In the latter part of this &s;cene, being informed that Henry is within fifteen hundred paces of the French camp, the &s;prightly and confident mon&s;ieurs divert them&s;elves at the expence of the Engli&s;h, whom they &s;eem to con&s;ider as an ea&s;y prey, and go off to prepare for certain victory.</P>
<P>Well met again, at the beginning of the fourth act, hone&s;t chorus. Some part of this addre&s;s to the audience, as well as other pa&s;&s;ages in the play, CIBBER has tran&s;planted into his RICHARD THE THIRD. A mo&s;t pitiable picture is drawn of Hen|ry's &s;ituation, yet the author has taken particular care to &s;u&s;tain the dignity of his character; this painting is very political, as his future, wonderful victory, is thereby thrown into a more con&s;picuous and advantageous light.</P>
<P>His de&s;cription of the king is &s;o ma&s;terly and a|miable, that we cannot avoid pre&s;enting our readers with a part of it.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;forth he goes and vi&s;its all the ho&s;t;</L>
<L>Bids them good-morrow with a mode&s;t &s;mile,</L>
<L>And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.</L>
<L>Upon his royal face there is no note</L>
<L>How dread an army has &s;urrounded him;</L>
<L>Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour,</L>
<L>Unto the weary and all-watch'd night:</L>
<L>But fre&s;hly looks, and overbears attaint</L>
<L>With chearful &s;emblance and &s;weet maje&s;ty;</L>
<L>That every wretch, pining and pale before,</L>
<L>Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="358" REF="364">After this very favourable impre&s;&s;ion is &s;truck by the chorus, Henry appears, remarking, with &s;uit|able compo&s;ure, to Bedford and Glouce&s;ter, the danger they are in. Upon the entrance of an aged knight, Sir Thomas Erpingham, the king good naturedly ob&s;erves, that the &s;oft pillow of peace is more adapted to his enfeebled age, than war's flinty couch; however, the &s;pirited baronet returns a brief and pithy an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Henry takes a &s;hort leave of them, as wi&s;hing to con&s;ult his own heart, previous to the impending conflict. When the peers have left him, the king, wrapped up in Sir Thomas Erpingham's cloak, is acco&s;ted by Pi&s;tol, who, in his pompous cant, pays Henry &s;ome compliments; but denounces heavy threats again&s;t Fluellin, which the king banters plea&s;antly.</P>
<P>After Pi&s;tol goes off, Gower and Fluellin meet; the latter, who greatly admires the Romans, de&s;cants warmly on military decorum, he contends hard for &s;ilence in a camp; and, upon being told that the French do not maintain any &s;uch re&s;erve, but are loud, very &s;en&s;ibly ob&s;erves, that their di&s;&s;ipated and irregular folly, is no ju&s;t &s;tandard for &s;oldiers, who regard reputation and &s;ucce&s;s to go by.</P>
<P>Three &s;oldiers, Bates, Court and Williams enter; the latter acco&s;ts King Henry, demanding whom he &s;erves under; he is an&s;wered, Sir Thomas Erping|ham. A very &s;ignificant conference en&s;ues, wherein the &s;oldiers exhibit melancholy ideas of their &s;ituation; the king rea&s;ons with them, and throws their danger upon the nece&s;&s;ity of invaded honour. Williams a&s;&s;erting, that a king who urges
<PB N="359" REF="365">
war, has the lives and limbs of his fellow-creatures to an&s;wer for, Henry enters into a very cool, candid and rational exculpation of royalty.</P>
<P>There is con&s;iderable in&s;truction, e&s;pecially for militarians, to be collected from this &s;peech: an ob&s;ervation that Williams makes, occa&s;ions the king to give a rebuke, which produces a challenge; Williams gives a glove, and Henry pre&s;ents him a|nother. When the &s;oldiers di&s;appear, his maje&s;ty ruminates upon what has pa&s;&s;ed, and ju&s;tly con&s;i|ders the regal &s;tate, as a fountain of ever &s;pringing cares. Some lines he utters on this occa&s;ion, we mu&s;t tran&s;cribe.</P>
<Q><L>And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?</L>
<L>What kind of God art thou that &s;uffere&s;t more</L>
<L>Of mortal grief than do thy wor&s;hippers?</L>
<L>What are thy rents, what are thy comings-in?</L>
<L>O ceremony, &s;hew me but thy worth;</L>
<L>What is thy &s;oul of adoration?</L>
<L>Art thou ought el&s;e but place, degree and form;</L>
<L>Creating awe and fear in other men?</L>
<L>Wherein thou art le&s;s happy being fear'd,</L>
<L>Than they in fearing.</L>
<L>What drinks thou oft in&s;tead of homage &s;weet</L>
<L>But poi&s;on'd flattery? oh be &s;ick, great greatne&s;s,</L>
<L>And bid thy ceremony give thee cure.</L></Q>
<P>The whole of this &s;peech is fine, but our fanciful author has run it to a length, beyond the power of any actor to &s;upport; it mu&s;t, in &s;ome places, hang heavy on expre&s;&s;ion, though every line plea&s;es in peru&s;al.</P>
<P>Being informed that his nobles are impatient to &s;ee him, the king de&s;ires they may be &s;ummoned to
<PB N="360" REF="366">
his tent; and, after a very pious ejaculation, though rather reli&s;hing of the proud Samaritan, who confi|dently boa&s;ted of his own good works, he goes off to meet them. In the next &s;cene we hear the Dauphin, and other French chiefs, proudly vaunting their &s;upe|riority over the drooping Engli&s;h; they ha&s;ten to the field, confident of &s;ucce&s;s, and leave the &s;tage for Henry and his party. There is an Irici&s;m in this line of We&s;tmorland's, <HI>but</HI> ONE <HI>ten thou&s;and of tho&s;e men in England.</HI></P>
<P>The royal Briton, though con&s;cious of the fear|ful odds again&s;t him, addre&s;&s;es his peers with heroic cheerfulne&s;s; and when Mountjoy comes with in|&s;olent propo&s;al of a ran&s;om, the gallant monarch declares they &s;hall have none but his bones. After this &s;cene the armies join in battle: while we are waiting and anxious for the great event, our author has unaccountably brought in a &s;cene between Pi&s;tol and a Frenchman, he has taken pri&s;oner; the whole of which is contemptibly farcical, and this pa&s;&s;age very reprehen&s;ible,  <Q REND="inline">"Signieur DEWE &s;hould be a gentleman;"</Q> playing upon &s;acred terms, though by mi&s;take, is no way allowable.</P>
<P>After this Bartholomew-fair dialogue, we learn from the Dauphin and Con&s;table, that the victory has gone again&s;t France; however, they go off to make a final effort. Henry enters, when a pathetic account is given of York and Suffolk, who have fallen in the battle: hearing a fre&s;h alarm, the Engli&s;h monarch gives an order, &s;hocking to human nature, however ju&s;tified by nece&s;&s;ity; that is to kill all the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>While the deci&s;ive &s;troke of battle is giving, we are entertained with Fluellin's ludicrous a&s;&s;imula|tion of King Henry to Alexander; and when the
<PB N="361" REF="367">
monarch comes on, the &s;ame humorous captain laughably mentions his being a Wel&s;hman. Wil|liams, to whom Henry, in di&s;gui&s;e, gave a glove, is brought on; being que&s;tioned why he wears that token of a challenge in his hat, he a&s;&s;igns the rea|&s;on; being &s;ent off for Gower, his captain, the king gives that glove he received from Williams to Fluellin, telling him, he took it from Alan&s;on in the battle, and that if any one challenges it, he mu&s;t be a friend of Alan&s;on's; Fluellin receives it with par|ticular &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>This &s;eems a boyi&s;h, unmeaning circum&s;tance, in the king's conduct, to put two men in the path of quarrel; and the moment he has done &s;o, di&s;patches two of his nobles to prevent any &s;erious con&s;e|quence. SHAKESPEARE has in this &s;acrificed the dignity of his hero to a de&s;ire of enriching Fluellin's character; and &s;hewing Henry's liberality, by fill|ing the glove with crowns for Williams.</P>
<P>After this frivolous, une&s;&s;ential point is &s;ettled, a herald recapitulates the lo&s;s of the French, which appears to be prodigious! e&s;pecially when com|pared to that of the Engli&s;h. The king, as a man of &s;ound &s;en&s;e and religion, mo&s;t ju&s;tly attributes the miraculous difference, to providential influence in his favour. The fourth act clo&s;es with Henry's order to embark for England.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act, we again meet our friendly chorus, who gives many &s;ubjects for imagination to work upon; without which the piece really makes a very disjointed and irreconci|liable figure. The choleric Wel&s;hman is pre&s;ented to us with a leek in his hat; which, according to
<PB N="362" REF="368">
his own account, he wears for &s;ake of Ancient Pi&s;tol, who had &s;lightingly mentioned that national ornament: opportunely his antagoni&s;t appears, to whom he gives terms of provocation, which the An|cient replies to by a fre&s;h in&s;ult upon leeks; this occa&s;ions Fluellin to in&s;i&s;t upon Pi&s;tol's eating that he has in his hat. So &s;evere a ta&s;k is contemptuou&s;ly declined at fir&s;t, but a few &s;tripes cau&s;e the boa&s;t|ing poltroon to comply, which however he does with high &s;ounding prai&s;e.</P>
<P>The kings of England and France are next brought to a friendly interview, which turns upon the &s;ubject of a pacific alliance, planned and urged by the Duke of Burgundy: Henry ob&s;erves, that the terms are before his Gallic maje&s;ty, and that on his an&s;wer peace depends. The French monarch de&s;ires time to recon&s;ider matters, which is allowed, and five Engli&s;h nobles are authorized to &s;ettle mat|ters with him.</P>
<P>All the other characters being gone, a very in&s;i|pid, aukward &s;cene of court&s;hip en&s;ues, between Henry and Catherine, a prince&s;s of France; words are played upon in a mo&s;t childi&s;h manner: we &s;ee no rea&s;on why Catherine &s;hould be the only per&s;on in the French court who does not &s;peak Engli&s;h; and that Henry, though the French language was not in his time &s;o fa&s;hionable as at pre&s;ent, &s;hould be ignorant of it when he claimed France as his na|tural, lawful inheritance. Had the&s;e ab&s;urdities in character &s;erved any &s;triking purpo&s;e, there would have been &s;ome degree of palliation; but the whole purport of four in&s;ignificant, word-catching pages,
<PB N="363" REF="369">
is to acquaint us with the monarch's de&s;ire to make Catherine his queen.</P>
<P>After this interview, the French king comes on, and all articles being agreed upon, particularly the propo&s;ed marriage, the play concludes. We &s;ee no rea&s;on for introducing the la&s;t chorus, as it is no|thing but a piece of unnece&s;&s;ary, hi&s;torical informa|tion.</P>
<P>The principal event of this tragedy, renders the &s;ubject dear to every Engli&s;h mind, el&s;e we cannot find &s;o many &s;hining proofs of SHAKESPEARE's ge|nius in HENRY the FIFTH, as in many of his plays: incidents are &s;adly crouded, and the la&s;t act is la|mentably languid; the comic parts are a mo&s;t un|natural connexion, and notwith&s;tanding we allow Fluellin to be well drawn, mo&s;t contemptible; there is very little to &s;trike in action, and as little to plea&s;ure in peru&s;al.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h monarch is drawn a mo&s;t excellent picture of what a king &s;hould be, wi&s;e, cool, politic, liberal, merciful and brave; fond of fame, but not in an unju&s;t cau&s;e. We have &s;een Mr. SHERIDAN di&s;play &s;olidity of judgment in this part, though royalty was much injured by his external appear|ance, and harmony of expre&s;&s;ion violently wounded by the di&s;cord of his voice. The ju&s;tification of a king, in ca&s;e of waging war, he delivered better than any other per&s;on we have &s;een.</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH is, upon the whole, more plea&s;ing, yet wants con&s;equence and variety.</P>
<P>Mr. BARRY, in this part, &s;teps far beyond any degree of competition, within our knowledge; his figure and manner happily unite to fill up our idea of the fifth Henry.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="370">The other &s;erious characters of this piece are too immaterial for recollection; however, we can ven|ture to &s;ay, that we have &s;een Exeter and the Con|&s;table of France, well &s;upported by Me&s;&s;rs. CLARKE and HULL; nor have we any fault to find with Mr. GARDNER, in the Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. Flu|ellin is a part of great oddity, and requires peculiar acting; we are inclined to think Mr. MACKLIN much more characteri&s;tic in this part than Mr. SHUTER.</P>
<P>Mr. THE. CIBBER made more of the popgun Ancient Pi&s;tol than po&s;&s;ibly ever will be &s;een again, by a laughable importance of deportment, extrava|gant grimaces, and &s;peaking it in the &s;onorous cant of old tragedizers, he exhibited a very entertaining piece of acting merit. Mr. DYER is nobody.</P>
<P>Mrs. PITT's Ho&s;te&s;s is worth notice, though &s;hort of Mrs. MACKLIN, who&s;e de&s;cription of Fal|&s;taff's dying was inimitable.</P>
<P>AARON HILL, favoured the town with a piece on the &s;ubject of this play, in which he pre&s;erved much more dramatic regularity, and approached nearer the tender pa&s;&s;ions, but has rather eclip&s;ed the blaze of genius. With all its irregularities, SHAKESPERAE's mu&s;t take the lead con&s;iderably, as indeed he always will in a &s;tate of compari&s;on; for even his weake&s;t, and mo&s;t cen&s;urable efforts, have in them an affluent originality, beyond the reach of any other dramatic author.</P>

<HEAD>The BUSY BODY. A COMEDY: By Mrs. CENTLIVRE.</HEAD>
<P>SIR George Airy meets Charles in the Park; the former appears to be a little unea&s;y in his mind, which the latter rallies him for plea&s;antly; in&s;inu|ating, that a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of omnipotent gold, may obtain any thing to lull unquiet feelings. Be|ing told that the cau&s;e is love, he &s;eems to think Plutus a more powerful deity than Cupid, and that the blind God mu&s;t yield to the God of Wealth.</P>
<P>It appears, that Sir George's pa&s;&s;ion is engaged by two ladies, one who&s;e face he has never &s;een, but is charmed by her wit; the other he has &s;een, and is captivated by her beauty, without having ever exchanged a word with her; Miranda, who is the ward of Charles's father, claims a preference. Sir Francis Gripe's avaritious character is opened, and his intention of marrying the young lady him&s;elf, for the &s;ake of her fortune, di&s;clo&s;ed to the baronet, who gains a promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Charles, to obtain the lady. Their conference is broke in upon by the appearance of Marplot, of whom a prepa|rative picture is given. The forward blade, after having eagerly urged an introduction to Sir George, accounts laughably for a black patch which appears on his no&s;e. Having formed &s;ome intimacy with the baronet, Marplot is a&s;ked by that gentleman to convey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> letter to Miranda; Charles ju&s;tifies his
<PB N="366" REF="372">
readine&s;s to go upon &s;uch &s;ervices, but paints him as a very blundering emi&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Hearing bu&s;ine&s;s mentioned, Marplot's curio&s;ity ri&s;es; Sir George excu&s;es his &s;taying any longer in the Park, by ob&s;erving, that he has an appointment with Sir Francis Gripe. Whi&s;per coming on, ac|quaints Charles that I&s;abinda can't meet him in the Park, but that her rigid, jealous father, will cer|tainly go out in the afternoon; he then goes to know the hour. Here Marplot is &s;adly mortified, at not knowing the purport of his me&s;&s;age, and de|termining to find out the occa&s;ion of Charles's a|brupt departure, follows him.</P>
<P>Miranda coming out of her chair, meets Patch, of whom &s;he enquires for I&s;abinda; and is told, that her father, Sir Jealous Traffic, has detained her at home; this knight's ridiculous attachment to the formal and tyrannical cu&s;toms of Spain, is here &s;et forth. It appears, that Patch, though really I&s;abinda's friend, has gained &s;o much of the father's confidence, that he tru&s;ts her in the &s;tile of a duenna, with the care of his daughter.</P>
<P>The waiting woman, who had formerly &s;erved Miranda in that capacity, takes the liberty of en|quiring about a common report, that Miranda is going to be married to her guardian; to this the lady replies, that &s;uch a report is nece&s;&s;ary, though not founded in truth. She then acquaints us, that &s;eeing a man &s;he likes, is the motive of her coming into the Park: Sir George appears to be the man, and comes forward in conference with Sir Francis. Miranda and Mrs. Patch, &s;tand a&s;ide and li&s;ten.</P>
<P>We find, that the young knight is bargaining with the old one, for a limited interview with his
<PB N="367" REF="373">
ward; in con&s;ideration of the &s;um of one hundred guineas, he con&s;ents to a conference of ten minutes, with this provi&s;o, that he &s;hall be pre&s;ent all the time; the old blade chuckles at having taken the baronet in, and leaves him. During their &s;cene, two remarks drop, one from the lady, and the other from the maid, not very delicate.</P>
<P>After Sir Francis retires, Miranda, under cover or a ma&s;k, comes forward. Seeing his incognita, Sir George &s;olicits a view of her face; this is de|nied, and he undergoes &s;ome &s;pirited raillery, which he &s;u&s;tains, and replies to in an agreeable manner. Being brought to a &s;ituation rather critical, and fearing a di&s;covery, &s;he &s;ugge&s;ts a method of get|ting off; which is by promi&s;ing, if he will turn his back, to let him know her meaning, who &s;he is, and her place of re&s;idence; this he complies with.</P>
<P>She retires gradually, confe&s;&s;ing, that he has in|&s;pired her with a very tender pa&s;&s;ion for him, then &s;he rhimes her&s;elf off. The baronet, plea&s;ed with his conque&s;t, hopes &s;he may prove hand&s;ome, and promi&s;es the behaviour of a gentleman. Hearing no voice &s;ound, he imputes the pau&s;e to her mode&s;ty, but begs &s;he will proceed; receiving no an&s;wer to repeated &s;olicitation, he turns round, and expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome chagrin at being &s;o jilted, concludes the act with &s;ix very flimzy lines, which we may ju&s;tly &s;tile pro&s;e ba&s;tardized into hobbling, unnatural ver&s;e.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the &s;econd act, we meet Sir Francis, telling his ward, with triumphant &s;atis|faction, of the bargain he has made with Sir George. She, to forward her own de&s;igns, &s;eems to reli&s;h the circum&s;tance highly; and pays the
<PB N="368" REF="374">
old fool &s;ome compliments, which cau&s;e him to think, that he has &s;ecured a place in her heart. She makes a propo&s;al to him, which, in the &s;low of good humour, &s;he hopes he may comply with; that is, if he will give her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her own fortune, &s;he will marry him the day after.</P>
<P>The danger of this he is aware of, and declines the propo&s;al; finding her&s;elf di&s;appointed, &s;he tacks about, and mentions a &s;cheme &s;he has formed to baffle Sir George, which is to maintain &s;trict &s;i|lence, and not an&s;wer a word he &s;ays. This plea&s;es the old knight greatly; however, his &s;atisfaction is rather damped by the appearance of his &s;on Charles, who pleads hard, re&s;pecting his nece&s;&s;itous circum&s;tances, but without any effect.</P>
<P>While the father and &s;on are parlying, Marplot enters, who, ob&s;erving Charle&s;s melancholy face, a&s;ks Sir Francis for a hundred guineas, for which the curmudgeon gives him an order on his clerk. When Marplot goes to receive his money, Sir Fran|cis makes a propo&s;al to Charles for mending his circum&s;tances, that is by marrying Lady Wrinkle, who&s;e age and deformities are &s;ufficiently compen|&s;ated for, by her having forty thou&s;and pounds. The young man's declining this propo&s;ition, occa|&s;ions the old one to drive him forth with very har&s;h terms. No &s;ooner is he gone than Marplot re|turns, counting his ca&s;h; when he mi&s;&s;es Charles, he hurries out after him, for fear of lo&s;ing &s;ome &s;ecret. Sir George Airy being &s;hewn in, Miranda is called; Sir Francis &s;ets his watch, and the inter|view immediately begins.</P>
<P>Sir George's attack upon the lady's inclinations is warm and &s;ignificant; the old centinel, who
<PB N="369" REF="375">
keeps watch, throws in &s;ome interruptive lines, but is by threats kept out of ear-&s;hot. The lady's un|accountable and invincible &s;ilence, cau&s;es the ena|moured baronet to teach her &s;igns, by which &s;he may an&s;wer &s;uch interrogations as he may chu&s;e to propo&s;e.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be a mi&s;take in the printed copy, where Sir Francis &s;ays there are <HI>three quarters</HI> of an <HI>hour</HI> gone, becau&s;e the time &s;pecified was <HI>ten minutes.</HI> Sir George having &s;ettled the mode of reply, he proceeds to offer his que&s;tions; her an&s;wers are &s;ome favourable, others doubtful. At length, tired with his un&s;atisfactory &s;tate, he tries another method, which is to &s;peak both for her and him&s;elf; and, in her behalf, produces a letter, which he reads and ki&s;&s;es rapturou&s;ly. In the heighth of his plea&s;ing emotion, Sir Francis acquaints him, that the time is expired., and giving Miranda the guineas, &s;ends her off.</P>
<P>Sir George's imperfect audience occa&s;ions Gripe to chuckle, which nettling the lover, he throws out a progno&s;tication of cuckoldom, and both the cha|racters clink them&s;elves off the &s;tage with &s;ome Grub-&s;treet lines. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how actors, or public ta&s;te, could bear &s;uch frequent intru&s;ions upon &s;en&s;e and nature; rhimes were, I &s;uppo&s;e, found to be clap-traps, and con&s;equently gained &s;ome de|gree of e&s;timation; but why are they not now re|jected in the old plays, as well as the new ones.</P>
<P>We are next introduced to Sir Jealous, who we hear lecturing his daughter, in favour of Spani&s;h re&s;erve and gravity. Patch, with politic addre&s;s, backs his opinion, and in&s;inuates, that I&s;abinda is rather prone to levity and re&s;i&s;tance; in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="370" REF="376">
of this, he gives the maid a fre&s;h authority and charge to lock her up, till the arrival of one Signior Babinetto, whom he expects hourly from Spain.</P>
<P>Whi&s;per, who has watched Sir Jealous going out, ha&s;tes to the door, where he meets Patch; &s;he informs him that I&s;abinda is now alone, and de&s;ires him to acquaint Charles. Ju&s;t as he is going off, he meets Sir Jealous, whom &s;u&s;picion has brought back: the knight que&s;tions him very roughly, as to what bu&s;ine&s;s has brought him near his door. This puzzles the valet; however, he &s;tarts a whim|&s;ical apology, of having lo&s;t his lady's lap-dog, and a&s;ks Sir Jealous if he has found the creature; by this device, he gets clear of the choleric old blade, who neverthele&s;s &s;eems to have &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Charles and Marplot next pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and are &s;oon joined by Sir George, who appears in the dumps: on a&s;king Marplot if Miranda's &s;ilence proceeded from her folly, he ju&s;tifies her title to wit, by mentioning, that &s;he has often rallied him till he had not a word to &s;ay for him&s;elf. Whi&s;per enters, and by &s;peaking a&s;ide to his ma&s;ter, &s;tirs afre&s;h the inqui&s;itive faculties of Marplot, who is a mortal enemy to all re&s;erve: his &s;troke of de&s;iring Sir George to a&s;k Charles what his &s;ervant has been &s;aying, is droll and in character. When Charles and the baronet propo&s;e going different ways, Marplot has &s;o &s;trong an in|clination to di&s;cover what the former is about, that though he is roughly refu&s;ed the privilege of going with him, he follows directly.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="377">At the beginning of the third act, Charles ap|pears at Sir Jealous Traffic's door, and is intro|duced by Patch: ju&s;t as he enters the hou&s;e, Mar|plot &s;pies him; and, by way of friend&s;hip, deter|mines to watch him out again. The lovers being met, they lay a plan for their own happine&s;s, and to defeat Sir Jealous's de&s;igns. An alarm of the old knight's approach, throws them into extreme confu&s;ion, amid&s;t which it is determined, that Charles &s;hall effect his e&s;cape from the balcony; this &s;ettled, they part.</P>
<P>Sir Jealous now appears in the &s;treet, and breathes out &s;uch terrible threats, in ca&s;e of finding a man in his hou&s;e, that Marplot, who overhears, in zeal for Charles's &s;afety, and to prove his courage, ac|co&s;ts the knight; and threatens, if any mi&s;chief is done his friend, he will retaliate it &s;everely. This di&s;covery rou&s;es Sir Jealous into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion, that he belabours the poor, unlucky, blundering intruder, mo&s;t unmercifully. Still &s;olicitous for Charles, he cries murder; the lover de&s;cending from the balcomy, perceives who it is that's rai&s;ing the tumult: here Marplot improves the mi&s;take he has made, by boa&s;ting of what he has done; but, upon getting a hearty &s;hake by the collar from en|raged Charles, he conceives his errors, and, droop|ing like a dog that had lo&s;t his ears, retires lament|ing his ill luck; but not without &s;ome hopes of gaining &s;uch intelligence for Sir George, concern|ing Miranda, as may bring him into favour again.</P>
<P>Sir Jealous, full of conviction that a man is in his hou&s;e, though not to be found, enters with &s;er|vants, enquiring if they have &s;earched every where: Patch &s;till pre&s;erving his confidence, he renews his
<PB N="372" REF="378">
orders for locking up I&s;abinda, then goes to renew his &s;earch. The maid comforts her mi&s;tre&s;s with the idea of gaining at la&s;t the man &s;he wi&s;hes, and they retire.</P>
<P>Sir Francis meets his lovely ward in the next &s;cene, and &s;he plays him off &s;o admirably, that he thinks her his own beyond a &s;hadow of doubt. Marplot enters to them, who mentions Sir George's hundred pounds, and upbraids Miranda with cheat|ing him of it: warm words ari&s;ing, Sir Francis bids the inqui&s;itive meddler get out of his hou&s;e. Upon hearing Miranda declare that &s;he will take her guardian for better for wor&s;e, Marplot banters the idea till he is threatened with the knight's cane, but having &s;o lately felt one, he de&s;i&s;ts. Miranda, with great addre&s;s, &s;ends an a&s;&s;ignation to Sir George, by bidding him keep from his old haunt, the gar|den gate, at the hour of eight. Her meaning is gro&s;sly mi&s;taken by both the old fool and young one, and her openne&s;s increa&s;es the old &s;wain's confidence, who leads her off, full of joy, with a Latin quotation.</P>
<P>The &s;cene now changes to a tavern, where Sir George and Charles are di&s;covered over a bottle: the baronet offers his friend &s;ome con&s;olation, to free his &s;pirits from that gloom which his late mi&s;|carriage has occa&s;ioned. The waiter mentioning that Mr. Marplot de&s;ires leave to wait on them, they de&s;ire him to be admitted: on his appearance, the unhappy adventurer puts on a face of confe&s;|&s;ion, and endeavours to apologize.</P>
<P>When Sir George enquires after Miranda, he gives a very unpromi&s;ing account, and declares her &s;ettled determination to marry Sir Francis; to
<PB N="373" REF="379">
which al&s;o, he adds her warning about the garden gate. Sir George does not immediately perceive her meaning, but, after a few &s;hort &s;peeches, catches it; and thanks Marplot for &s;o plea&s;ing a piece of intelligence. His &s;atisfaction puzzles our Bu&s;y Body.</P>
<P>In order to take &s;o unlucky an object out of the way, Charles urges Marplot to go with him; he is plea&s;ed at being forgiven, but &s;u&s;pecting, from Sir George's behaviour, &s;omething that de does not under&s;tand, he re&s;olves upon going to Sir Francis Gripe's, that he may &s;tand a chance of finding it out.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;cene of the fourth act is before Sir Jealous's door, where Patch receives a letter from Whi&s;per for her mi&s;tre&s;s; and de&s;ires him to ac|quaint his ma&s;ter, there will be a fair opportunity for paying a vi&s;it to I&s;abinda, by means of a ladder of ropes: hearing the old man, &s;he hurries the va|let off; and, in her confu&s;ion, drops the letter: no &s;ooner does &s;he di&s;appear, than Sir Jealous comes on; he perceives the billet, which, upon opening, he finds to be hieroglyphically in&s;cribed. This unintelligible object cau&s;es fre&s;h &s;u&s;picion, and a glimp&s;e he got of Patch's tail &s;weeping by, throws &s;ome part of it on her.</P>
<P>A &s;ervant entering, Sir Jealous enquires for &s;ome company he had invited; being told that they will all wait upon him, he countermands the invi|tation; calls for his butler, and orders that &s;upper may be brought into his daughter's chamber. I&s;a|binda and Patch are thrown into &s;trong perplexity about the letter, which cannot be found. The maid running out to &s;ee if &s;he had dropped it by
<PB N="374" REF="380">
the way, is met at the door by the butler, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s being a&s;ked, he &s;ays it is to lay the cloth in that room, for his ma&s;ter's &s;upper. This cir|cum&s;tance &s;ugge&s;ts to the young lady &s;ome fre&s;h mi&s;chance: the old man approaches, &s;tops Patch, and que&s;tions his daughter about the letter; &s;he pleads ignorance, and the chambermaid, to make up for her blunder, invents an a&s;&s;ertion, that the paper is hers; declares it was given her as a charm for the tooth ach, and throws her&s;elf into violent agitation at the misfortune of its being opened, as the magic power is thereby de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>This bait takes with the old knight, and I&s;abin|da, collecting &s;ome &s;pirit from the &s;ucce&s;s of it, accu&s;es her father of &s;everity; to which he an&s;wers, that Signior Babinetto's arrival, will free her from all parental authority. Supper being placed on table, he a&s;ks the young lady to partake; which, from her &s;tomach being already too full, &s;he de|clines. He next de&s;ires, that as &s;he can't eat, &s;he will entertain him with a tune on the &s;pinnet, while her maid &s;ings a &s;ong; both the&s;e reque&s;ts, through con|fu&s;ion, they are &s;o unable to comply with, that one plays, and the other &s;qualls mo&s;t mi&s;erably out of tune, which provokes the old man to threats.</P>
<P>While they are endeavouring to proceed, Charles bolts in upon the wings of rapture; but &s;eeing Sir Jealous, retires ha&s;tily, though not &s;o &s;oon but that he is perceived: to cover his retreat, the women cry, a gho&s;t! a gho&s;t! and throw them&s;elves acro&s;s the door. Having given the lover time to e&s;cape, they make way for the impa&s;&s;ioned knight, who ru&s;hes into the clo&s;et, bent on di&s;covery and de|&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="381">He &s;oon returns, and not having found the main object of re&s;entment, lets his wrath wreak it&s;elf on the females; his daughter he locks up in a clo|&s;et, and then drives Patch out of doors. In this exiled &s;tate &s;he meets Charles, and acquaints him, not only of I&s;abinda's impri&s;onment, but al&s;o that her de&s;tined Spani&s;h hu&s;band is expected on the following day, and is to con&s;ummate the nuptials with all po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of Charles's di&s;traction, Patch &s;ug|ge&s;ts his per&s;onating Babinetto, and furni&s;hes him a letter, by counterfeiting which, he may gain credit with Sir Jealous, who knows nothing more of the young Don, than what occurs by corre&s;|ponding with his father. This politic hint revives the lover, and they go off to concert matters, by which room is made for Sir George, who appears at the garden gate; through which he is &s;oon con|veyed by Scentwell into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Miranda, in &s;oliloquy, apologizes for a &s;eeming breach of delicacy, in bringing Sir George to vi&s;it her in a clande&s;tine manner, but the ju&s;tification &s;he offers is very allowable; &s;uch a guardian as her's would ju&s;tify any young woman for taking all &s;teps, but vicious ones, to defeat his loath&s;ome de|&s;igns upon her per&s;on, and knavi&s;h views upon her fortune.</P>
<P>The baronet advances with polite rapture: in the conference which en&s;ues, we find Miranda &s;o prudent, that &s;he wont gratify her inclination by a violent attack upon circum&s;tances, but determines, before &s;he leaves Sir Francis's hou&s;e, to take the writings relative to her fortune along with her. Sir Francis's unexpected return obliges Sir George
<PB N="376" REF="382">
to make a precipitate retreat behind the chimney|board; it appears, that Gripe's return has been oc|ca&s;ioned by Marplot's per&s;uading him, that Mi|randa had certainly &s;ome fatal, barbarous meaning, in the blunderbu&s;s. Sir Francis de&s;ires Scentwell to throw an orange peel behind the chimney|board, this &s;he evades, by de&s;iring to eat it; but that be|ing refu&s;ed, Miranda de&s;ires the board may not be removed, as &s;he has a monkey, which being very wild, might do mi&s;chief, if let out.</P>
<P>Marplot immediately expre&s;&s;es &s;trong curio&s;ity to &s;ee what he calls, aptly enough, a miniature of man; however, he is forced to de&s;i&s;t by threats, and Sir Francis goes off to vi&s;it his rich neighbour at Ep&s;om, from whom he expects a large legacy.</P>
<P>While Miranda attends her guardian to his coach, Marplot lifts up the board, when out bolts Sir George, and thropples the frightened, inqui&s;i|tive blade; who, in his confu&s;ion, de&s;ires the ba|ronet to break &s;ome china, as an apology for the uproar he has made.</P>
<P>Sir Francis and Miranda returning, Marplot frames a &s;tory of the monkey's e&s;cape, for which he receives a &s;evere rebuke from the old fellow; who, after ordering &s;earch to be made for the little favo|rite, goes off again to pro&s;ecute his journey. Miranda upbraids Marplot, who accounts laughably for his mi&s;apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir George returns, when Marplot begs to be excu&s;ed, and is, upon his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, forgiven. Patch enters, and acquaints Sir George, that a friend of his wants a&s;&s;i&s;tance: on being told that it is Charles, he determines to wait on him, but de|clines Marplot's company, who expre&s;&s;es great de|&s;ire

of going al&s;o; and to prevent him, in&s;i&s;ts he may &s;tay with Miranda, &s;o concludes the fourth act.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth, we meet Mi|randa, telling Patch that &s;he has taken a bold and hazardous &s;tep, by venturing upon a hu&s;band, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition &s;he is not &s;ufficiently acquainted with: after ordering Scentwell to pack up her jewels, &s;he is going to leave the hou&s;e; at which time mo&s;t inopportunely, &s;he meets Sir Francis, who having found him&s;elf &s;ummoned upon a &s;ham me&s;&s;age, has declined the continuation of his journey.</P>
<P>Scentwell entering abruptly with a diamond necklace in her hand, occa&s;ions &s;ome confu&s;ion; but Miranda pa&s;&s;es it off with ready addre&s;s, and turns the matter quite off, by telling him of I&s;a|binda's approaching marriage with a Spani&s;h Don, to which &s;he is invited: the amorous guardian, hoping that the &s;ight of matrimony may whet his ward's appetite for a &s;imilar fea&s;t; he promi&s;es to go, and receiving an equivocal declaration from Miranda, that if ever &s;he marries, it mu&s;t be in the cour&s;e of that day; he leads her off with terms of mo&s;t triumphant joy.</P>
<P>Sir Jealous next appears, who being told by a &s;ervant that Signior Babinetto is arrived, receives, and brings Charles, attended by Sir George, as Mr. Meanwell, forward: after &s;ome attempts at Spa|ni&s;h, which Sir Jealous is very imperfect in, the conver&s;ation is continued in Engli&s;h. Sir George, with great art, as a deputed guardian to the young Don, and many plau&s;ible arguments, urges an im|mediate marriage; which the father &s;eems very well inclined to, after being &s;atisfied in one point;
<PB N="378" REF="384">
that is, why no mention has been made in the in|troductory letter of tho&s;e five thou&s;and crowns, which were to be &s;ettled on his daughter, in ca&s;e of her becoming a widow.</P>
<P>This unexpected circum&s;tance occa&s;ions &s;ome he&s;itation; but Sir George an&s;wering that the value of that &s;um is con&s;igned to his care, for the pro|po&s;ed purpo&s;e, in various kinds of valuable mer|chandize, Sir Jealous is &s;atisfied, &s;ends for Mr. Tackum, who, as it appears, is ready.</P>
<P>The angry father goes off, and drags on his daughter, who &s;olicits hard again&s;t a forced mar|riage, but to no purpo&s;e, &s;he adheres to her re&s;o|lution; after much threatning, and many violent remon&s;trances from Sir Jealous, Sir George under|takes the per&s;ua&s;ion, and by privately communi|cating who the apparent Spaniard really is, gains her to the de&s;ired point. Her rapture, which breaks out a little untimely, is re&s;trained; the fa|ther, heartily rejoiced at this unexpected and &s;ud|den conver&s;ion of his perver&s;e child, gives her with tears of &s;atisfaction, to Don Diego, and they all go off, highly &s;atisfied, to the celebration of tho&s;e nup|tials which the young couple &s;o eagerly wi&s;h, and Sir George has earne&s;tly laboured to promote.</P>
<P>Marplot, without adverting to his former blun|ders, which have brought him into &s;uch di&s;agreea+ble &s;ituations, now runs headlong into a from &s;crape; and having heard that Charles has bor|rowed a Spani&s;h habit, determines to enquire about him at Sir Jealous Traffic's. Pat to his purpo&s;e, a &s;ervant comes out of the hou&s;e, of whom he a&s;ks if there be a gentleman in a Spani&s;h habit at his ma&s;ter's; from the minutene&s;s of his enquiry, and
<PB N="379" REF="385">
&s;aying he thought a friend of his might be there in di&s;gui&s;e, the footman &s;u&s;pects a po&s;&s;ibility of im|po&s;ition, and calls his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>When Sir Jealous comes forth, he acco&s;ts Mar|plot churli&s;hly, demanding his bu&s;ine&s;s; on men|tion of a Spani&s;h habit, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a friend of Babinetto's, and is que&s;tioned as &s;uch, but not being able to give any intelligent account of who or what he wants, the old gentleman grows warm, and perceiving that he is the per&s;on who had threatened him with half a dozen mirmidons, he frightens poor Marplot in &s;uch a manner, that he comes to an explanation about Charles, which a|larming the father, he calls in to &s;top the mar|riage.</P>
<P>This noi&s;e brings out Sir George, with his &s;word drawn; &s;eeing Marplot, he finds out the &s;ource of evil incidents, which, to confirm, the bu&s;tling Bu&s;y Body calls the baronet by title and name, which unfolds the deceit, and an attempt is again made to &s;top the marriage; however, Sir George &s;tanding centinel between the door and him, orders it to go on: finding him&s;elf foiled, he wreaks his vengeance on Marplot, who once more feels the di&s;cipline of his cane.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is Charles and his bride enter; &s;oon after them Sir Francis and Miranda come forward. Sir Jealous accu&s;es Gripe with being acce&s;&s;ary to cheating him of his child; Sir Francis being de|&s;ired to open his pur&s;e in favour of Charles, he de|clines any concern with him as a &s;on, and declares his &s;ettled connexion with Miranda.</P>
<P>Here Sir George &s;teps in, and claims the lady as his; this, &s;he confirms, and, as it appears, has not
<PB N="380" REF="386">
only taken care to get her own writings, but Charles's too, relative to an e&s;tate left by an uncle, which the Jew, his father, kept from him. Thus totally over-reached, Sir Francis leaves them with great heat of pa&s;&s;ion: after his departure, matters take a more favourable turn, and Sir Jealous, with a commendable &s;hare of good &s;en&s;e, cools into good humour.</P>
<P>The &s;everal parties being agreeably di&s;po&s;ed of, Marplot a&s;ks, what reparation he is to have for the hard u&s;age he has received; forgivene&s;s of his blunders, and a promi&s;e from Sir George, that his guardian &s;hall give him his e&s;tate, and make him happy. Thus the piece concludes, a very incon|te&s;tible moral being deduced from pa&s;t tran&s;actions in three lines: if we &s;earch for &s;olidity of &s;entiment, or purity of language in this comedy, our enquiry will be fruitle&s;s; yet there is a pertne&s;s of dialogue, and a womani&s;h whim of incident, that mu&s;t ever tickle the lighter pa&s;&s;ions, and keep attention upon a plea&s;ing bent.</P>
<P>As to the characters, they are natural and well cho&s;en; as will appear upon their being &s;eparately examined. Sir George is a fine gentleman, with elegant ideas, lively feelings, and a large e&s;tate; he meets with a woman he likes, and &s;pares neither money nor pains to obtain her honourably. One circum&s;tance is odd, that he never once mentions his fair incognita after the fir&s;t act: the author might ea&s;ily have di&s;covered to him that Miranda was the per&s;on, and a good &s;cene might have been &s;truck out, of her rallying him upon the ma&s;ked lady; however, this is a very pardonable lap&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="387">Mr. PALMER, was in this gay baronet too much of the fop, indeed, it was &s;o natural to him, he could not &s;hake it off. Mr. SMITH has &s;ufficient vivacity, without dimini&s;hing e&s;&s;ential elegance; we never de&s;ire to &s;ee the part better &s;upported than by this gentleman.</P>
<P>Sir Francis Gripe we find &s;o complete a &s;on of avarice, as warmly to wave every principle as a father, guardian, or man, to the in&s;atiable love of gain; his prepo&s;terous amour is more founded in wealth than regard; his &s;ituations are plea&s;ant, and render him rather an object of laughter, than of the contempt he really de&s;erves. Mr. YATES, a great favorite of ours, for &s;trict adherence to nature in his proper ca&s;t, was remarkably cha&s;te in this cha|racter, which he played upon the mo&s;t critical prin|ciples; and, certain it is, that though Mr. SHUTER may make the galleries laugh more, by a luxuriance of humour, yet he never can be &s;o correct.</P>
<P>Mr. PACKER has done the inoffen&s;ive Charles for many years inoffen&s;ively enough; we have &s;een Mr. CLARKE exhibit him, but think the part far beneath his abilities; and, as to Mr. HULL, who goes on for him at pre&s;ent in Covent Garden, we never wi&s;h to meet him in any but the graver parts of comedy, many of which he would &s;upport in a very re&s;pect|able manner. Why is not Charles given to Mr. LEWES, who ought to be brought forward in &s;uch a light, till practice and improved merit make him fit for a more favourable one.</P>
<P>Sir Jealous Traffic is extremely well contra&s;ted to Sir Francis, as his folly does not ari&s;e from a bad heart, but a deficient head; violent regard for his daughter, makes him anxious for her happine&s;s, and
<PB N="382" REF="388">
a mi&s;taken notion of the means to prevent any &s;ini&s;ter accident, makes him &s;eem cruel, when he really means well; there is an open bluntne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion about him, which Mr. LOVE is very characteri&s;tic in, and we think Mr. DUNSTALL e|qually happy.</P>
<P>Marplot, the main engine of this piece, is a very well conceived caricature of nature, adequately drawn, and prettily fini&s;hed: notwith&s;tanding a Bu&s;y Body in private life, is a very mi&s;chievous and obnoxious character, yet Mrs. CENTLIVRE has con|trived to pre&s;ent us with one &s;o inoffen&s;ive and laughable, that we believe many of the audience would be glad of &s;uch an acquaintance to exhile|rate their &s;pirits occa&s;ionally: we remember many performers in this character, Mr. MACKLIN very dry, in&s;ipid and &s;aturnine: Mr. THE. CIBBER, e|gregiou&s;ly comical, extravagant and incorrect: Mr. BROWN, by &s;ome thought a good actor, though certainly the wor&s;t that ever was &s;een, faint, inde|&s;criptive and laborious: Mr. GARRICK, lively and expre&s;&s;ive, but too mechanical: Mr. KING, &s;pirited and picture&s;que, with rather too much &s;en&s;ibility: Mr. WOODWARD, every thing the author or &s;pecta|tor could wi&s;h, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every beauty his compe|titors could boa&s;t, and exhibiting a &s;uitable naiv&eacute;te above them all.</P>
<P>Miranda has nothing blameable, but being a lit|tle too forward in her love affair; &s;he &s;eems to have good &s;en&s;e, &s;teadine&s;s and genero&s;ity. Mrs. PAL|MER was very unequal to the repre&s;entation of this part, yet, being an amiable actre&s;s, pa&s;&s;ed off with|out giving offence, Mrs. BULKLEY mended the
<PB N="383" REF="389">
matter a good deal, but we are much inclined to place Mi&s;s MACKLIN fir&s;t.</P>
<P>I&s;abinda was very improperly given to Mrs. MATTOCKS, who is much fitter for Patch; howe|ver, &s;he repre&s;ented the young lady in a re&s;pectable manner: Mi&s;s PLYM was well &s;uited to the part, as is Mrs. BAKER.</P>
<P>Patch &s;hould always be in the hands of Mrs. GREEN, though we have &s;een Mrs. PITT &s;hew act|ing merit in the character, and Mi&s;s MINORS per|form it extremely well. We readily admit this play to a &s;tage exi&s;tence, but we think it &s;carce worth any body's purcha&s;e for the clo&s;et; notwith|&s;tanding it is free from the heavy charge of licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, which ju&s;tly lies again&s;t &s;ome abler com|po&s;itions.</P>

<PB N="384" REF="390">
<HEAD>King HENRY the Fourth. An Hi&s;torical PLAY: SHAKESPEARE.</HEAD>
<P>THE King, attended by his &s;on, Lord John of Lanca&s;ter, and other peers, gives us to under|&s;tand, that the play opens with a newly commenced peace; yet from what We&s;tmoreland &s;ays, we find that a general calm is not e&s;tabli&s;hed, notwith&s;tand|ing a deci&s;ive victory gained by Piercy, over the Scots. Mention of this young nobleman occa&s;ions Henry to paint, with &s;trong feeling, the di&s;reputa|ble contra&s;t between Hot&s;pur and his &s;on, the Prince of Wales: nothing further material occurs in this &s;cene, except that Piercy has refu&s;ed to deli|ver up the pri&s;oners taken in battle. In the next we meet Prince Henry and Fal&s;taff; the lat|ter enquiring what time of the day it is, is rallied by the Prince for demanding any information con|cerning a circum&s;tance &s;o totally immaterial to his irregular cour&s;e of life; the fat knight retorts, by painting his royal companion as gracele&s;s as him|&s;elf. This is very natural, for the di&s;&s;olute always endeavour to level other characters with their own; or, if po&s;&s;ible, to make them wor&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;cene is chiefly made up of a quibble of words, yet is &s;en&s;ible and entertaining. When Poins comes on, there is a fine equivocal turn in Fal&s;taff's character: &s;ome few lines before, we find him bent on a new cour&s;e of life, but, upon men|tion
<PB N="385" REF="391">
of a robbery, which is likely to produce de|&s;ireable &s;poil, he hears the matter, and joins in it with great glee; wi&s;hing that the Prince may be an a&s;&s;ociate, he goes to Ea&s;tcheap.</P>
<P>After the knight has waddled out of &s;ight, Poins propo&s;es a &s;cheme of amu&s;ement, that is, to rob Fal&s;taff, Bardolph, Peto and Gad&s;hill, after they have acquired the booty: to this project the vola|tile Prince agrees readily; the mode of proceeding is &s;ettled, and Poins retires to provide nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>When alone, Henry, though linked with &s;uch a di&s;&s;ipated crew, and &s;eemingly involved amid&s;t the depths of iniquity, makes &s;ome glorious reflections; wherein, his &s;pirit as a man and a royal character, break brightly forth.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation that his latter years will &s;hine more bright by a comparative view with the gloom of his former ones, is not a very allowable apology for joining in a cour&s;e of life, which, in his own conviction, is held de&s;picable; however, the &s;oli|loquy throws a plau&s;ible glo&s;s on his character, and prepares us agreeably for the reformation he &s;ug|ge&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene we meet the King, highly net|tled at being cro&s;&s;ed, as it &s;hould &s;eem, by Hot|&s;pur, and his relations. Upon Worce&s;ter's at|tempting an apology, he is forbid the pre&s;ence: af|ter a palliative introduction, delivered by Northum|berland, Hot&s;pur enters upon his own defence, con|cerning refu&s;al of tho&s;e pri&s;oners which the King had demanded: his addre&s;s is very peculiar and &s;pirit|ed; his contra&s;t of the rough &s;oldier's character, to a perfumed, effeminate peer, is finely imagined, and happily expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="392">King Henry, however, con&s;iders his reply as equivocal, and founded on provi&s;o, that Mortimer, a &s;ubject hateful to maje&s;ty, &s;hould be ran&s;omed. Hearing an imputation of Mortimer's revolting, Hot&s;pur, with characteri&s;tic impatience, contends this point warmly with the King, and maintains his brother-in-law's character, both as a &s;ubject and commander. This altercation rou&s;es Henry to &s;ome &s;evere terms, and a po&s;itive in&s;inuation, that further di&s;obedience of his orders, will be attended with di&s;agreeable con&s;equences.</P>
<P>This peremptory threat occa&s;ions a flow of pa&s;|&s;ion, which vents it&s;elf on Hot&s;pur's &s;ide, in a very glowing &s;tile. Being forbid even to &s;peak of Mor|timer, &s;tings &s;o home, that every trace of patience is obliterated; and, with the utmo&s;t heat of temper, he charges ingratitude and tyranny again&s;t the King. After &s;pending the fire of his re&s;entment in frenzied &s;tarts and bitter reproaches, he conde|&s;cends to hear &s;ome cool and politic advice from his cou&s;in Worce&s;ter; who points out &s;ome vin|dictive mea&s;ures by the path of rebellion, which he deems very practicable, from powerful di&s;contents which agitate many leading characters of the realm.</P>
<P>Piercy's expectation warms from this view, &s;o con&s;onant to his de&s;ires, and he concludes the fir&s;t act with a wi&s;h, formed by wounded pride, and a kind of military enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the &s;econd act, two car|riers are introduced, throwing &s;ome very low reflect|ions upon their quarters and accommodations. After having informed us of their &s;tation, and that they are going to continue their journey, they make room for the Prince and Poins, who having re|moved
<PB N="387" REF="393">
Fal&s;taff's hor&s;e out of his reach, the puffed knight comes on, almo&s;t breathle&s;s with fatigue, calling for them, and de&s;cribing his own cumber|&s;ome, painful &s;ituation: when they appear, he a&s;ks, partly in a pa&s;&s;ion, and partly &s;oothing, for his hor&s;e. Gad&s;hill and Bardolph giving notice that the monied travellers are at hand, they take their &s;tations; while Henry and Poins retire to put on their di&s;gui&s;es.</P>
<P>Hearing a furious noi&s;e of  <Q REND="inline">"&s;tand, down with them,"</Q> &amp;c. the travellers drop their ca&s;h, which the valorous Sir John and his mirmidons have no &s;oon|er taken, than it is taken from them again by the Prince and Poins, in buckram &s;uits. This jocular de&s;ign being happily executed, the victorious cou|ple go off, enjoying their cheap conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Hot&s;pur, in &s;oliloquy, now pre&s;ents him&s;elf, pe|ru&s;ing a letter, on which he makes &s;ome whim&s;ical comments, as the contents are matter of excu&s;e from &s;ome de&s;ireable parti&s;an, whom he expected to join in his enterprize. In the following &s;cene with his lady, which, by the bye, is very immaterial, he di&s;covers much peculiarity and flightine&s;s of tem|per; &s;he, with a kind of childi&s;hne&s;s, endeavours to wheedle from him, the cau&s;e of manife&s;t pertur|bation, which, neverthele&s;s, he declines communi|cating, and in a manner we think unnece&s;&s;ary un|genteel, though bluntne&s;s &s;eems to be a material part of his character.</P>
<P>We are now tran&s;planted to the tavern in Ea&s;t|cheap, where the Prince and Poins appear, &s;till en|joying their adventure. Henry, in the flow of &s;pi|rits, boa&s;ts an intimacy with a parcel of drawers, and with Poins's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, plays upon the &s;impli|city
<PB N="388" REF="394">
of one, in a manner that might very well be|come a Bartholomew-fair droll, but is too meanly farcical for the &s;tage, though it &s;eldom fails of a laughable effect.</P>
<P>After this unmeaning piece of buffoonry, Fal|&s;taff and his crew are introduced: the knight &s;ets forward with a furious exclamation again&s;t cowards, not forgetting to compliment him&s;elf, as being one of the only three hone&s;t, valuable men in England. At length, he broadly in&s;inuates, that Henry is a|mong the li&s;t of cowards, but, upon getting a re|buff from the Prince, readily and humorou&s;ly re|tracts his meaning, yet continues the in&s;inuation: having mentioned taking a prize of a thou&s;and pounds, and its being mo&s;t violently forced from him again, he enters into a very curious account of his own valorous re&s;i&s;tance, wherein &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances and contradictions occur, as mu&s;t di|late the rigide&s;t features.</P>
<P>After he has gone through the detail with mo&s;t entertaining prevarication, the Prince enters upon his account, which reduces Fal&s;taff to a dilemma apparently inextricable; yet with invincible effron|tery, and quick addre&s;s, he exhibits a ma&s;terly &s;troke of equivocation, by ob&s;erving, that he knew it was the Prince who attacked him, and out of re&s;pect to the blood royal, would not make any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as this point is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the Ho&s;te&s;s enters in a violent hurry, acquainting the Prince, that a nobleman of the court de&s;ires to &s;peak with him: Fal&s;taff is deputed to give him an an&s;wer, which charge he &s;peedily fulfills, and upon return, gives &s;ome hints of the civil commotions which are on
<PB N="389" REF="395">
foot. The Ho&s;te&s;s again enters, and acquaints them that the Sheriff is at the door, demanding en|trance, to &s;earch for &s;ome men who have committed a robbery. Fal&s;ta&s;t, con&s;cious, claims protection; he is ordered behind the arras, and the Sheriff ad|mitted, who, being que&s;tioned of his bu&s;ine&s;s, de|clares it: the knight being plainly pointed at, Prince Henry &s;creens him, by a&s;&s;erting his ab&s;ence upon bu&s;ine&s;s; and that he will him&s;elf undertake to an&s;wer any charge that may be brought again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed guilty per&s;on.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trate being di&s;patched, and danger with him, Fal&s;taff is heard &s;noring: the Prince or|ders Poins to pick his pocket, from whence he ex|tracts nothing but papers; one of which, being read, proves a curious tavern bill, the principal ar|ticle of which is an enormous quantity of &s;ack&punc; Henry declares his intention of going to court in the morning, and &s;ays, he will not only provide for Poins, but procure Fal&s;taff a company of foot. With this &s;trange intention the act concludes, &s;trange, we &s;ay, becau&s;e however flighty the Prince might be in his general conduct, we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that in &s;o &s;erious and critical an affair as civil war, he would put a proved poltroon, a known &s;coun|drel, into commi&s;&s;ion: but the author found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, &s;o without any &s;cruple or apology, he has &s;acrificed royal prudence and decorum, to the pre|&s;ervation and enlargement of his favorite character.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, we find our|&s;elves in the pre&s;ence chamber at Wind&s;or: the King having de&s;ired his nobles to retire, lectures the Pr. of Wales with much paternal feeling, and eloquent energy; his &s;peeches, though fine and pithy, are
<PB N="390" REF="396">
beyond doubt, too laboriou&s;ly long for the actor's expre&s;&s;ion: his &s;on's vindication of him&s;elf, and promi&s;e of future actions, &s;uitable to his dignity, &s;how a &s;pirited &s;en&s;ibility, which melts the King into a cordial reconciliation, who immediately gives him an honourable command, and appoints the day for his marching to meet the rebels.</P>
<P>Sir John and Bardolph &s;ucceed this royal inter|view; the former complains that he finds him&s;elf in a con&s;umptive &s;tate, and therefore &s;eems inclined to repent of his di&s;&s;olute cour&s;es; but, upon Bar|dolph's blaming him for fretting, reverts again to vice, and je&s;ts upon the red no&s;e of his Bacchana|lian follower. Seeing the Ho&s;te&s;s, our fat knight mentions his having his pocket picked, which irri|tates the lady much, as being a heavy charge again&s;t the credit of her hou&s;e: a warm altercation en&s;ues, in which they both di&s;play con&s;iderable abilities.</P>
<P>He a&s;&s;erts having lo&s;t a &s;eal ring, worth forty marks, which &s;he declares the Prince had often told her was copper. This occa&s;ions Sir John to utter &s;ome heavy threats, but, upon &s;eeing Henry, he turns the &s;ubject off; however, Mrs. Quickly re|&s;olves to have it handled, and to that end tells the Prince, that Fal&s;taff had threatened to cudgel him. This cau&s;es a fre&s;h and very laughable altercation, in which the knight is con&s;iderably embarra&s;&s;ed; however, his old and con&s;tant friend equivocation &s;tands by him, till Henry fla&s;hes conviction, by declaring, that he was the cau&s;e of this exaggerated robbery, which produced nothing but tavern bills, and a halfpenny worth of &s;ugar-candy. This ex|planation, after a conce&s;&s;ion from Fal&s;taff, brings all matters to a right under&s;tanding; the Prince
<PB N="391" REF="397">
acquaints his fat favorite, that he has procured him a charge of foot, then gives Bardolph &s;ome di&s;|patches for Lord John of Lanca&s;ter.</P>
<P>From the two conclu&s;ive lines of this act, we very plainly perceive that Fal&s;taff is much better inclined to a tavern than military operations.</P>
<P>Hot&s;pur, Worce&s;ter and Douglas, begin the fourth act, in Shrew&s;bury: the former compliments the latter with generous terms of e&s;teem. A me&s;|&s;enger brings &s;ome letters, and the di&s;agreeable in|telligence, that &s;ickne&s;s prevents Piercy's father from joining per&s;onally the common cau&s;e. Wor|ce&s;ter &s;eems to think his ab&s;ence a great damp upon their enterprize; however, Hot&s;pur, with unbate|ing &s;pirit, thinks it will reflect greater credit upon their daring attempt. Sir Richard Vernon informs them of the powerful preparations which are moving forwards, to make head again&s;t them. Piercy enquires particularly after the Prince of Wales, which gives Sir Richard an opportunity of de&s;cribing him and his warlike companions, with very beautiful imagery. This fires Hot&s;pur, who longs to enter the li&s;ts again&s;t &s;uch gallant oppo|nents, though una&s;&s;i&s;ted by his father and Glen|dower.</P>
<P>Sir John and Bardolph now appear upon their march to Coventry: having di&s;patched his follower for a bottle of &s;ack, the knight, in &s;oliloquy, gives a mo&s;t diverting account of the &s;oldiers he has picked up; his in&s;inuation of mi&s;u&s;ing the king's pre&s;s money, we believe fits many a recruiting of|ficer. Prince Henry coming on with We&s;tmore|land, a&s;ks who&s;e fellows they are that come after, and make &s;o wretched a figure. Fal&s;taff acknow|ledges

them to be his, and humorou&s;ly con&s;iders them as merely food for powder, con&s;equently good enough for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Hot&s;pur, Worce&s;ter, Douglas and Vernon, again come forward, debating whether they &s;hall give battle the &s;ame night, or refer it to another day. Piercy's impatience wi&s;hes to &s;eize the earlie&s;t oppor|tunity, and Douglas &s;upports his opinion; Vernon and Worce&s;ter di&s;&s;ent. After rea&s;ons urged on both &s;ides, it remains &s;till an undetermined point; when Sir Walter Blunt addre&s;&s;es them on emba&s;&s;y from the king, who &s;ent by him &s;ome plau&s;ible offers of pacific redre&s;s, in ca&s;e any real grievances can be made out. In Hot&s;pur's reply, which is nervous and circum&s;tantial, he accu&s;es the king of ambi|tion, duplicity and ingratitude, not to be tru&s;ted; however, he de&s;ires a night to con&s;ider the royal propo&s;ition, and promi&s;es to &s;end a categorical re|ply by his uncle Worce&s;ter in the morning.</P>
<P>Our author has judiciou&s;ly concluded this act with probable ideas of peace, which bring on more forceably the operations of the next.</P>
<P>King Henry, at the beginning of the fifth act, gives audience in his camp to Worce&s;ter, who reca|pitulates the cau&s;es of complaint, which his ma|je&s;ty treats with contempt. The Prince of Wales, perceiving that all hopes of accommodation are va|ni&s;hed, and that war is to be the arbitrator, with a gallant genero&s;ity, propo&s;es to re&s;t the general di&s;|pute upon a &s;ingle combat between him and Hot|&s;pur. This plea&s;es the King, his father, highly; however, with humane conde&s;cen&s;ion, he once more offers, upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to decline ho&s;tilities, nay,
<PB N="393" REF="399">
even a renewal of royal favour, to his rebellious op|ponents.</P>
<P>There is a mo&s;t centemptible piece of &s;tage buf|foonery introduced here, which ought to be repul&s;ed, not laughed at; we mean Fal&s;taff's &s;itting upon the &s;ame drum with the King, and tumbling down when Henry gets up; SHAKESPEARE's luxuriant humour needs no &s;uch pitiful re&s;ources. Fal&s;taff's &s;oliloquy, where he inve&s;tigates the meaning and value of honour, is as laughable an apology for cowardice as ever was penned.</P>
<P>Worce&s;ter, from a &s;uppo&s;ition that the King's &s;mooth propo&s;itions are founded in fallacy, declines acquainting his nephew with them; and, on Hot|&s;pur's appearance, mentions &s;uch aggravating terms as precipitate a battle. Vernon's de&s;cription of the Prince of Wales's challenge, is delicate and gene|rous. On being told that the royal army comes forward, Hot&s;pur and party go off to meet them, with a truly martial &s;pirit. Here alarms are heard, and Sir Walter Blunt is &s;lain by Douglas. A good deal of the &s;kirmi&s;hing introduced by SHAKE|SPEARE, is properly omitted in repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>The fat knight has another &s;oliloquy, and though horribly frightened, pre&s;erves his humour; the giving him a bottle of &s;ack in a pi&s;tol hol&s;ter, is whim&s;ically characteri&s;tic. While Hot&s;pur and the Prince of Wales are engaged, he comes on va|pouring, but &s;eeing Douglas, falls down as if dead. When Hot&s;pur has yielded his breath to his victo|rious competitor for glory, the generous conqueror pays an expre&s;&s;ive and pathetic compliment to his qualifications: &s;eeing his old companion Jack
<PB N="394" REF="400">
pro&s;trate, he &s;peaks of his fall with friendly though ludicrous regret.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t being clear, our prudent knight gets up, rejoicing in his own &s;afety, and applauding the means of it. The &s;ight of Piercy, though dead, touches him with fre&s;h panic; however, he collects re&s;olution enough to make him &s;ure, and giving him a wound in the thigh, declares his re&s;olution to claim the honour of killing him. Here the Prince of Wales returns, with his brother Prince John of Lanca&s;ter. Seeing Fal&s;taff with Hot&s;pur on his back, he is &s;urprized, and is &s;till more &s;o at Sir John's a&s;&s;erting him&s;elf to be the conqueror of Hot&s;pur; however, he good-naturedly inclines to countenance his humour, and the knight lugs off his honourable burden.</P>
<P>King Henry, after &s;entencing Worce&s;ter and Vernon to death, declares his intention of pur&s;uing rebellion through all its haunts, and thus the play concludes.</P>
<P>Though we do not he&s;itate to pronounce tragi|comedy to be the mo&s;t heterogenious production that ever entered the human imagination, yet we mu&s;t contend that our author has in this piece made it as pardonable and probable as a union &s;o unnatural would admit. In the tragic &s;cenes there is great dignity and fire of expre&s;&s;ion; in the comic ones, unparalleled plea&s;antry. The plot, though void of unities, has a face of regularity, and keeps attention agreeably employed through the whole.</P>
<P>As to characters, we find Henry cool, politic and re&s;olute, well &s;uited to his elevated &s;tation; in per|formance, little more is requi&s;ite than importance
<PB N="395" REF="401">
of deportment, and propriety of declamation. Mr. SPARKS, in the former was &s;tiffly mechanical, in the latter, irk&s;omely laborious; yet &s;hewed more merit in the fir&s;t &s;cene with Piercy, than any other per|former within our notice. Mr. GIBSON, is un|doubtedly a burthen to him&s;elf in this part, con&s;e|quently can't &s;it very light on the eyes, ears or feel|ings, of an audience. Mr. BANNISTER is better than either.</P>
<P>The Prince of Wales is totally made up of light and &s;hade, his di&s;&s;ipated &s;tate and &s;hameful compa|nions, render him an object of contempt; but his martial &s;pirit, when called upon, and his real cou|rage, &s;o happily tempered with genero&s;ity, pre&s;ent him to view a very e&s;timable character. As a rake he is plea&s;ant, as a hero &s;triking; in the tavern a trifler, but in the field important. Mr. RYAN had an ea&s;e in this mad-cap prince, which pre&s;ented him in a very agreeable manner. Mr. PALMER did the comic part well, but was egre|giou&s;ly deficient in the &s;erious &s;cenes. Mr. CAU|THERLY is boyi&s;h at fir&s;t, and in&s;ipid at la&s;t. We do not recollect any per&s;on better calculated to do the character general ju&s;tice than Mr. SMITH, he is well adapted by nature to give us an idea of the gentleman and prince.</P>
<P>Hot&s;pur is marked a very peculiar character, exactly an&s;wering our author's de&s;cription of a &s;ol|dier in AS YOU LIKE IT,  <Q REND="inline">"jealous of honour, &s;udden and quick in quarrel:"</Q> an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer of fame, who enters the li&s;ts of rebellion, rather from ill founded re&s;entment than any ambitious view; however his cau&s;e de&s;erves cen&s;ure, the original mo|tive of it admits of &s;ome defence; while his &s;pi|rited
<PB N="396" REF="402">
conduct commands applau&s;e, and his fall de|mands pity from every generous mind.</P>
<P>A martial figure, with great voluble powers, are the requi&s;ites for this character; we have heard one Mr. DELANE much &s;poke of, but have too faint an idea to corroborate report. Mr. BARRY we often attended with great plea&s;ure, his externals pleaded powerfully for him, and he &s;hewed many capital &s;trokes; but in the la&s;t &s;cene of the fir&s;t act, was re|markably deficient; the breaks and tran&s;itions wanted e&s;&s;ential &s;pirit and variety.</P>
<P>Mr. MOSSOP has power well &s;uited to Hot&s;pur, but having le&s;s ea&s;e and more &s;amene&s;s than Mr. BARRY, is con&s;equently le&s;s plea&s;ing. Mr. SMITH, who indeed is &s;eldom any thing but Mr. SMITH, can never do the gallant Piercy ju&s;tice; had Mr. GARRICK martial con&s;equence, his other requi&s;ites would &s;urpa&s;s all competition.</P>
<P>The other tragedy parts we don't &s;ufficiently re|collect for critici&s;m; indeed, they afford no great opportunity for con&s;picuous merit to &s;hew it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fal&s;taff is, beyond doubt, one of the mo&s;t luxu|riant productions that ever &s;prung from human imagination; a character &s;o inimitably drawn, that by the force of irre&s;i&s;table humour, we are led not only to forgive the unprincipled knight, but even to view him as an object of &s;ingular regard. There is not a &s;entence he utters but fea&s;ts atten|tention. The author has in this part &s;hewn mo&s;t powerful originality, and Mr. QUIN was in the repre&s;entation of him a true di&s;ciple of Mo|mus; his comely countenance, his expre&s;&s;ive eye, his happy &s;well of voice, and his natural im|portance of deportment, all united to make up a
<PB N="397" REF="403">
mo&s;t characteri&s;tic piece of acting. To point out one &s;troke where &s;uch uniformity of merit adorned the whole, may &s;eem &s;uperfluous; yet it would be ingratitude to the remarkable plea&s;ure we felt from unu&s;ual excellence, not to mention that pa&s;&s;age, where Fal&s;taff's lies about the battle and buck|ram men, are pinched &s;o clo&s;e, that he has no no refuge but the very unexpected one of pretend|ing that he knew the concealed a&s;&s;ailants, and therefore con&s;idered the whole matter as a joke. There was in this place &s;uch a glow of feature and expre&s;&s;ion, as we &s;hall never &s;ee equalled.</P>
<P>Mr. BERRY was a deplorable falling off, as heavy and unmeaning as a bare repetition of the words would admit. Mr. SHUTER's common fault, that of being too comical, lies much again&s;t him in the corpulent knight. Mr. LOVE is certainly correct, and &s;tands next in our idea to Mr. QUIN. His fi|gure, features, eyes and manner, are agreeable to critici&s;m; but we wi&s;h him a little more animation, a little of that luxuriance which Mr. SHUTER has too much of. Poins is well &s;upplied by Mr. PACKER.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing of the la|dies, they are &s;o trifling: Lady Piercy is the very &s;impleton of tragedy, totally u&s;ele&s;s, and unenter|taining; we have &s;een Mrs. WOFFINGTON, Mrs. BELLAMY, Mrs. HAMILTON, and Mrs. PALMER, daudle on for this part, without being able to di&s;|cover any &s;uperiority of merit, &s;o very in&s;ipid is the compo&s;ition; indeed, were it not to compliment Hot&s;pur, an indifferent actre&s;s would &s;uit it better than a fir&s;t rate one; becau&s;e the former would probably take &s;ome pains, while the latter mu&s;t un|doubtedly de&s;pi&s;e &s;o ungracious an undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="404">The Ho&s;te&s;s, for what &s;he &s;ays, is well deline|ated; Mrs. MACKLIN made her appear to great advantage, and we are &s;ufficiently plea&s;ed with Mrs. PITT, and Mrs. BRADSHAW.</P>
<P>From what we have &s;aid it will evidently follow, that the author of this play, though he has mani|fe&s;ted great abilities in the compo&s;ition, for want of female characters and familiar incidents, has greatly abated the &s;ucce&s;s of it on the &s;tage; few ladies have the &s;ame reli&s;h for Fal&s;taff's rhodomon|tades that Queen Elizabeth had. In the clo&s;et it mu&s;t ever plea&s;e &s;ub&s;tantial ta&s;te.</P>

<HEAD>The MOURNING BRIDE. A TRAGEDY: By CONGREVE.</HEAD>
<P>WE are told that the ingenious parent of this tragedy, was four years fini&s;hing it, an old adage, &s;ignifying, that too much cookery &s;poils the broth, here &s;trikes us, and we wi&s;h it may not be verified by the pre&s;ent object of con&s;ideration; but as we have hitherto avoided anticipation of judgment, let examination fir&s;t take place, and candor, as hereto|fore, decide.</P>
<P>The MOURNING BRIDE begins with &s;ome very happy lines, &s;poken by Almeria. By the &s;cene be|tween her and her confidante Leonora, which is too diffu&s;e and prolix, we find, that the Prince&s;s's father, Manuel, had depo&s;ed King An&s;elmo, to who&s;e &s;on Alphon&s;o, &s;he had been married unknown to her father; we are al&s;o informed, in a very poetical, but unnatural manner, that Alphon&s;o, flying with his bride from Manuel's fury, was wrecked, and in her idea lo&s;t for ever; hence Almeria's di&s;tre&s;s, which &s;he expre&s;&s;es emphatically.</P>
<P>Shouts of triumph are heard: after Almeria's re&s;olving to vi&s;it the tomb of An&s;elmo, Gonzales enters. From him we receive a pompous account of King Manuel's triumphant entry: the Prince&s;s hears of her father's &s;ucce&s;s with cold indifference; the old &s;tate&s;man hints his &s;on Garcia's devotion of
<PB N="400" REF="406">
heart for Almeria, but that &s;ubject is interrupted by the victorious monarch's approach.</P>
<P>Manuel &s;eeing his daughter and her train in the &s;able weeds of mourning, while &s;plendor and joy gild every other part ot his palace and kingdom, con&s;iders her &s;ingularity as a mark of di&s;re&s;pect, and checks her in &s;evere terms. She apologizes, by &s;aying, &s;he keeps that day as the anniver&s;ary of her deliverance from &s;hipwreck. This vague excu&s;e, rather irritates than &s;oftens the King, who orders her from his &s;ight, enjoining a change of dre&s;s. We think this order &s;hould be complied with in the remainder of the play, as certainly a per&s;on of Ma|nuel's violent temper, would have re&s;ented in ex|pre&s;s terms, a fre&s;h in&s;tance or continuance of di&s;o|bedience; we don't remember to have &s;een this point ob&s;erved upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>As the Prince&s;s is going off, Garcia puts in his claim; which Manuel confirms, by giving his daughter's hand, and appoints the next day for their nuptials. This &s;udden, irre&s;i&s;table &s;troke, o|verwhelms Almeria with a fainting fit, by which &s;he gets clear for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Alonzo here acquaints the King, that his lovely captive Zara, the Moori&s;h Queen, is arrived. Be|fore her entrance, &s;ome intimation is given of O&s;|myn's character. Zara is received by her con|queror, not only with benevolent, but amorous po|litene&s;s, which &s;he receives with haughty re&s;erve; however, the monarch re&s;olving to per&s;evere, frees her with his own hand, then addre&s;&s;es O&s;myn, who replies with enigmatical fullenne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="407">Zara, fearful of any ill con&s;equence, apologizes for him, hy imputing his concern to having lo&s;t, in the confu&s;ion of battle, a valued friend called Heli. The King orders &s;earch to be made for him, and concludes the act with a rapturous decla|ration of his pa&s;&s;ion in &s;ome tolerable lines, if they did not rhime.</P>
<P>The &s;econd act begins with Garcia, Perez and Heli, in &s;earch of O&s;myn; they get &s;ight of him gliding acro&s;s the I&s;le of a Temple. Heli intreats to follow his friend alone: when they are gone off, Almeria and Leonora come forward; the latter feels very natural, womani&s;h fear, at being amid&s;t &s;o awful and terrifying a &s;cene; but the former, made de&s;perate by grief, &s;eems to enjoy the horrors of &s;o gloomy a place. Having gained the tomb of An|&s;elmo, &s;he perceives, with &s;urprize, the iron and marble gates open: after making an addre&s;s to the grave, as a refuge from care, and con&s;equently the &s;eat of peace, &s;he mounts her fancy in very bomba&s;t terms to &s;tarry orbs, milky ways, liquid light, and &s;eats of bli&s;s; mere poetical trumpery, when thus made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>After &s;everal emphatic repetitions of Alphon&s;o's name, he, in the habit and character of O&s;myn, ri&s;es from his father's tomb; &s;o unexpected an ob|ject &s;trikes the Prince&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment, that brings on another fainting fit: he endeavours to call her &s;en&s;ation back, while Heli enters unob|&s;erved by him. At length, being re&s;tored and convinced of her hu&s;band's identity, terms of the mo&s;t endearing nature are interchanged; but our author has certainly rendered the &s;cene heavy, by extending it too far: he &s;eems to have con&s;ulted
<PB N="402" REF="408">
the indulgence of his own genius, more than nature and the ea&s;e of attention.</P>
<P>Perceiving Antonio, known by the name of He|li, their &s;atisfaction is con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed: while they are employed in mutual congratulations, upon &s;o unexpected a meeting, Leonora perceives &s;ome per&s;ons in &s;hining garments cro&s;&s;ing the I&s;le, whom Heli di&s;covers to be Zara and Selim: her ill-placed pa&s;&s;ion for O&s;myn is mentioned to Al|meria, and he reque&s;ts, for mutual &s;afety, that the Prince&s;s may retire, which &s;he does.</P>
<P>Previous to Zara's entrance, O&s;myn reflects up|on the penury of &s;ight, which only admits exterior objects, and tho&s;e through nece&s;&s;ity. This is not unnatural for a lover's extravagant ideas, but though common &s;en&s;e admits the great latitude and &s;uperiority of mental perception, we are not to throw a kind of philo&s;ophical contempt on &s;uch refined organization as the &s;ource of vi&s;ion: but love and rea&s;on &s;o very &s;eldom meet, that this pa&s;|&s;age, though it might be &s;pared, neverthele&s;s &s;tands in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>Zara, urged on by her violent pa&s;&s;ion for the noble captive, pur&s;ues him even to the gloomy re|gion of death. Seeing him in a &s;tate of deep, and to her regardle&s;s contemplation, &s;he upbraids him with &s;lighting the affection &s;he has &s;hewn for him, and urges &s;ome powerful proofs of love. In this &s;cene, the lady di&s;covers more romantic warmth than delicacy of feeling, and ca&s;ts off every trace of becoming pride: &s;he offers, through her influ|ence over Manuel, to give him liberty, which, knowing her terms, he declines. This rou&s;es her to the rage of a di&s;appointed female, tinctured with
<PB N="403" REF="409">
jealou&s;y, and &s;he re&s;olves to irritate Manuel again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at this cri&s;is, the amorous monarch enters; who, hearing that O&s;myn dares to be a rival, orders him to pri&s;on and puni&s;hment: then concludes with a boyi&s;h ob&s;ervation, that love is the main &s;pring of life.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act, we meet O&s;|myn, a pri&s;oner, ruminating upon the tran&s;ition from his father's tomb to an ignominious dungeon. He reads a paper, found in his cell, which, by the by, is very unnaturally thrown into blank ver&s;e: this &s;croll appears to be a tender, &s;upplicatory ad|dre&s;s to heaven, from his decea&s;ed father An&s;elmo, for his deliverance and protection; one word being torn off, cau&s;es an abrupt conclu&s;ion, and O&s;myn moralizes on that circum&s;tance, in a &s;trange, per|plexed manner.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, he comes upon the point of eternal ju&s;|tice, which, notwith&s;tanding the profe&s;&s;ed privilege of thinking, he leaves ju&s;t as he finds it: we agree with our author, that thought precedes the will to think, but cannot own that error lives, ere rea&s;on can be born; or that rea&s;on, though a fallible, can ju&s;tly be deemed a mere twinkling light, fooling the follower.</P>
<P>WHITFIELD him&s;elf, nor any other enthu&s;ia&s;t, could have given a more unworthy picture of hu|man nature's foremo&s;t attribute: Heli comes op|portunely to break this chain of fal&s;e, or, at lea&s;t, partial philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving that he has gained admi&s;&s;ion by Al|meria's influence over the guard, O&s;myn enquires how &s;he is, and whether he may hope to &s;ee her:
<PB N="404" REF="410">
being an&s;wered affirmatively re&s;pecting the la&s;t point, he expre&s;&s;es fears for her pur&s;uing misfor|tunes in his per&s;on. The following compari&s;on of him&s;elf to chaff, is abominably far fetched:
<Q><L>One driven about the world like bla&s;ted leaves</L>
<L>And chaff, the &s;port of adver&s;e winds; till late</L>
<L>At length impri&s;on'd in &s;ome cleft of rock,</L>
<L>On earth it re&s;ts, and rots to &s;ilent du&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>Heli offers friendly con&s;olation, and acquaints him, that there are di&s;orders ripening in the &s;tate, which hang as a &s;torm over the head of Manuel, and promi&s;e fair in O&s;myn's favour. This rai&s;es the noble captive's &s;pirits, and, for a moment, he fancies him&s;elf at the head of a conquering army; which idea of exultation is &s;oon turned into rage, on feeling the re&s;triction of his chains: his friend judiciou&s;ly recommends a moderation of &s;uch violent feelings, and advi&s;es, at lea&s;t in appearance, an a|batement of his aver&s;ion to Zara; adding a de&s;ire, that he may ca&s;t his main hopes upon providence.</P>
<P>Heli going off, O&s;myn, in &s;oliloquy, accu&s;es him|&s;elf for que&s;tioning the impartial care of heaven, in temporal di&s;pen&s;ations; and, at the &s;ame time, bla|zons his father's piety in that re&s;pect. We are &s;orry to find in a &s;peech of &s;uch moral and religious intention, the Book of Pre&s;cience mentioned; as it immediately draws the thinking mind into an idea of prede&s;tination, which we deem the mo&s;t uncom|fortable opinion that human nature can &s;u&s;tain, The pa&s;&s;age we here object to, reminds us of four lines in one of DRYDEN's plays, which &s;eem to us
<PB N="405" REF="411">
the odde&s;t &s;light of &s;peculative fancy, that ever was committed to paper:
<Q><L>If fate be not, then how can we fore&s;ee?</L>
<L>Or how can we avoid it if it be?</L>
<L>Whether we drive, or whether we are driven,</L>
<L>All ill belongs to us; all good to heav'n.</L></Q></P>
<P>What a &s;pacious and intricate &s;cope of &s;pecula|tion, do the two fir&s;t lines propo&s;e? how vague and un&s;atisfactory a come off, do we find the two la&s;t exhibit?</P>
<P>Zara entering, covered with a veil, is mi&s;taken by O&s;myn for Almeria, and therefore tenderly ad|dre&s;&s;ed: upon perceiving his mi&s;take, he manife&s;ts &s;urprize, which betrays feelings no way con&s;onant to the Moori&s;h Queen's wi&s;hes. This cau&s;es her again to upbraid him, though in tender terms; at the &s;ame time, &s;he pities his mournful &s;ituation, and &s;eems painfully to con&s;ider her&s;elf as the cau&s;e of it: his reply is generous, but his exculpation of her, by bringing in <HI>fate</HI> as the &s;ource of his woes, is blameable.</P>
<P>Expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h that he had not been a &s;lave, particularly at &s;uch a time, the enamoured Queen promi&s;es, ere the ri&s;e of morn, to procure him li|berty: the account &s;he gives of love forcing his eye-balls abroad, at the dead hour of night, is a &s;trained, unnatural effu&s;ion of fancy.</P>
<P>When Zara retires, O&s;myn pronounces a &s;hort eulogium upon her internal virtues, and external charms; yet concludes with con&s;idering her, from the violence of pa&s;&s;ions, as an object more to be feared than loved: here Almeria appears, whom he receives with the utmo&s;t tran&s;port, though in|cumbring
<PB N="406" REF="412">
chains damp his tender feelings; to be a captive without probable hope of enlargement, &s;tings his heart. The Prince&s;s &s;trives to &s;ooth his pangs, yet is too &s;en&s;ible of them to check her melt|ing &s;ympathy.</P>
<P>Several &s;peeches which occur between this di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed pair, are totally in the bomba&s;t &s;tile; par|ticularly where O&s;myn puts in practice that con|temptible &s;tage trick, da&s;hing on the ground; and the de&s;cription of the effects de&s;pair is like to have on him, is highly offen&s;ive. In &s;hort, this whole &s;cene, though of pathetic tendency, is an impo&s;ition upon nature; equally injurious to humanity and common &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>While they are &s;unk into a &s;tate of undi&s;cerning grief, Zara re-enters, producing the King's &s;ignet for O&s;myn's liberation: being reque&s;ted by Perez, Captain of the Guard, to &s;top till the Prince&s;s is retired, her Moori&s;h maje&s;ty catches the gleam of jealou&s;y. O&s;myn perceiving her, conducts Almeria off, returning thanks for the conde&s;cending notice &s;he has been plea&s;ed to take of an unknown captive.</P>
<P>Zara &s;ees through his di&s;&s;imulation, and addre&s;&s;es him in terms which are a very &s;mall degree above Billing&s;gate; for which we think the author highly blameable, &s;ince a royal character, though as &s;ub|ject to the unruly pa&s;&s;ions as tho&s;e of lower &s;tation, &s;hould &s;till maintain a &s;uitable dignity of &s;entiment.</P>
<P>After indulging her fury in reproaches, &s;he or|ders the guard, not only to confine him more &s;trictly, but to watch that he makes no attempt at &s;elf-de&s;truction. Then concludes the act, with an ob&s;ervation, which we take to be very well ground|ed; that there is nothing more dangerous than love
<PB N="407" REF="413">
turned into hatred, nor any thing more vindictive than an amorous, jealous woman &s;corned.</P>
<P>Zara and Selim open the fourth act; by what pa&s;&s;es between them, we find that &s;he has deeply incen&s;ed the King, and that Manuel's rage has re|ceived fre&s;h fuel from &s;ome accounts of a revolt among&s;t his troops, and the flight of Heli, with &s;ome other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. Being told that the fate of O&s;myn, even for immediate execution, is &s;igned, the Queen relents, and re&s;olves to defer his death. The agitations of a female mind in love, are here well de&s;cribed; the turbulence of rage and hate give way to &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;o cir|cum&s;tanced we believe natural enough, even in a virago.</P>
<P>Puzzled to find probable means of &s;aving the man &s;he loves, we hear her threaten the eunuch Selim with in&s;tant death, unle&s;s he &s;ugge&s;ts &s;ome|thing for her purpo&s;e: at this exigence he advi&s;es her not to di&s;cover any change in favour of O&s;myn, but to reque&s;t that execution may be done upon the noble pri&s;oner in private, and by her mutes, as &s;uppo&s;ing the royal guard to be bribed. Here Manuel comes forward, dooming &s;ome rebellious leaders to death: by what Gonzales intimates to the King, we find &s;ome imperfect information has been received that Alphon&s;o is &s;till alive; by com|parative circum&s;tances Zara di&s;covers that O&s;myn is Alphon&s;o.</P>
<P>This cau&s;es fre&s;h anxiety, as his fate &s;eems ine|vitable; however, &s;he re&s;olves, at all events, to at|tempt his pre&s;ervation: for this purpo&s;e, &s;he urges the nece&s;&s;ity of his death, and frames a deceptive tale, importing that &s;he knows of a triple league
<PB N="408" REF="414">
between Alphon&s;o, Heli, and O&s;myn. This gains Zara confidence with Manuel, who readily falls into her &s;cheme of having him put to death by the mutes, and &s;eems highly &s;en&s;ible of the obligation conferred by the zeal &s;he &s;hews for his intere&s;t up|on &s;o important an occa&s;ion. Orders in con&s;e|quence of this arrangement are given, that no per|&s;on &s;hall have admittance to the Captive Moor, but &s;uch per&s;ons as have authority from Zara.</P>
<P>In the recollection of her jealous feelings, &s;he throws in a &s;u&s;picious hint, that even the Prince&s;s mu&s;t not be allowed to vi&s;it him. Gonzales, with the true penetration of a practi&s;ed politician, &s;u&s;|pects the Moori&s;h Queen's &s;incerity, from &s;o parti|cular and &s;o emphatic an interdiction. Upon hinting the matter, Zara inadvertently &s;lips out that &s;he had heard of an interview between O&s;myn and Almeria: this fires the King's re&s;entment, to which &s;he gives an artful turn, and retires, under pretence of preparing her mini&s;ters for the execution of O&s;myn. No &s;ooner is &s;he retired than Gonzales mentions his doubts in explicit terms to the King, who for &s;ome time con&s;iders her as a &s;anguine friend; but being awaked from the lethargy of confidence, at length &s;ees with the eyes of unpre|judiced caution, and fires at the thought of his daughter's di&s;obedient infidelity.</P>
<P>At this unlucky cri&s;is the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Prince&s;s comes before her father, who indulges his rage, and loads her with reproach for the my&s;terious and ill-timed grief &s;he wears; his pa&s;&s;ion throws her into &s;till greater confu&s;ion of mind, and this her intem|perature he concludes to be proof of &s;ome hidden, dangerous guilt. At length, the King's mention
<PB N="409" REF="415">
that he knows <HI>who</HI> O&s;myn is, throws her into a &s;tate of mental agony, bordering on de&s;peration, and &s;he drops &s;ome hints re&s;pecting her hu&s;band; which, but that they are deemed the offspring of di&s;traction, mu&s;t cau&s;e the ruin of all her deare&s;t hopes.</P>
<P>Another convenient fainting bout is introduced, which rather checks the &s;ubject. After &s;ome dis|jointed flights on her file, the King orders her to be taken care of as an infane object; when her fa|ther retires, Gonzales endeavours to &s;ooth Almeria's grief, which increa&s;es to &s;uch an height, that &s;he explains at full the &s;ecret of O&s;myn's being Al|phon&s;o; then impelled by the force of a frenzied imagination, runs off, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he hears her&s;elf &s;ummoned by the mournful &s;ound of Alphon&s;o's dying voice.</P>
<P>Gonzales finding a fir&s;t hu&s;band in the way to impede his &s;on's progre&s;s to royalty, by marriage with the Prince&s;s, deliberates how he may be&s;t work his own ambitious views for the aggrandi&s;ement of his family: he fears to tell the King of the di&s;co|very he has made, lea&s;t paternal feelings &s;hould work him to a reconciliation; the captive Queen he al&s;o apprehends danger from, on account of her &s;ecret attachment.</P>
<P>At length he re&s;olves, without opening his de|&s;ign any farther than by ordering Alonzo to procure him the dre&s;s of a mute; with this, and an intima|tion that Alphon&s;o mu&s;t be &s;lain, he concludes the act, a&s;&s;erting al&s;o his re&s;olution to place the crown at all events on Garcia's head.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth act we meet the King, rather di&s;turbed that Zara, nor any of her
<PB N="410" REF="416">
attendants are to be found. Ju&s;t as Perez is giv|ing an account how O&s;myn is bound to earth with double chains, a mute appears, who, on &s;ight of Manuel, retires precipitately. Alonzo is di&s;patched to &s;eize him, on account of his having di&s;covered &s;uch di&s;order, and concealed &s;omewhat in his bo|&s;om; Alonzo quickly returns with a paper, and information that the mute had &s;tabbed him&s;elf on its being forced from him.</P>
<P>Upon peru&s;al of the paper, it appears that the King is mo&s;t violently agitated: turning &s;hort, and perceiving Perez to be within ear-&s;hot, he fir&s;t reproves him for &s;o pre&s;uming a &s;ituation, and then charges him with not only being privy to the di&s;|gui&s;e of Alphon&s;o, as O&s;myn, but al&s;o of Almeria's intercour&s;e with him, and Zara's attachment in proof of which latter charge he reads &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the intercepted letter.</P>
<P>The injured officer pleads his &s;ervices, as de&s;erv|ing better u&s;age, but obtains no other return than the unkingly one of a blow; after which he is or|dered to drench his dagger in Alphon&s;o's heart; this he &s;tartles at, but promi&s;es, on a threat again&s;t his own life, to perform. Enraged maje&s;ty then gives way to an after thought, and propo&s;ing to confront Zara, orders the cell where &s;he intends &s;eeing O&s;|myn to be darkened, intending to be him&s;elf robed in Alphon&s;o's habit, and laid pro&s;trate as the cap|tive is, that &s;he may have no idea of deception till conviction fla&s;hes upon her.</P>
<P>Seeing the Queen approach he avoids an inter|view, and retires. Zara perceives him, and draws apprehen&s;ion from his enflamed looks: we wi&s;h, at &s;uch an anxious period, &s;he had not &s;tepped a&s;ide for
<PB N="411" REF="417">
the a&s;&s;imulation of his eye to the dog &s;tar, which al|lu&s;ion would be forced and &s;uperfluous in any cha|racter, but is egregiou&s;ly wrong for a <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> lady, &s;ince in that country they have not &s;uch ideas of a&s;tronomy as we have, even among the men, and the females are totally ignorant of every &s;cience, the mo&s;t familiar; therefore, mention of an ab&s;tru&s;e one here is peculiarly ab&s;urd, but our author &s;eems determined to wrap her up with &s;imilitudes this &s;eene.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing Selim deficient in &s;ome of his pro|ceedings &s;he upbraids him, while he, in a very mo|ral &s;train, ju&s;tifies him&s;elf under the idea of mortal imperfection. Two mutes, with that common tra|gedy appurtenance, a bowl of poi&s;on, are ordered to attend this wrong-headed Queen, which, as &s;he hopes, and is determined to &s;et Alphon&s;o free, we don't &s;ee occa&s;ion for, unle&s;s it be to prepare the audience for death. Gonzales next enters to the pri&s;on, di&s;gui&s;ed and alone; he &s;urveys the man|&s;ion of mi&s;ery, he perceives the inner door to be unbarred, and enters with murderous intention.</P>
<P>Garcia comes on at this critical point of time, calling eagerly for his father; Gonzales &s;oon re|turns, chafed at the interruptive clamours, howe|ver it appears he has done the deed of death. When Garcia mentions the city is all in confu&s;ion, and that O&s;myn is fled with Perez to the foe, Gon|zales a&s;&s;erts that part of the intelligence is fal&s;e, as his poinard reeks with the Moor's blood. To prove this a&s;&s;ertion, Garcia goes into the cell, and returning in&s;tantly proclaims his father murderer of the King.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="418">This dire mi&s;take throws them into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and the old &s;tate&s;man wi&s;hes to atone it with the &s;acrifice of his own life; however, as things are circum&s;tanced, they re&s;olve to conceal Manuel's fate, and for this purpo&s;e Alonzo is or|dered to &s;ever his head from the dead trunk. This done, they go off to oppo&s;e the in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>Zara, teening with gloomy &s;entiments and fatal re&s;olutions, comes forward, attended by Selim and her mutes: the &s;till horror of the &s;cene affects her, &s;he &s;ends the mutes to tell Alphon&s;o that &s;he waits him, and orders Selim to acquaint the King &s;he has done what he commanded. When the mutes re|turn, with unu&s;ual terror in their eyes, &s;he enquires the cau&s;e, which they di&s;clo&s;e by opening the back &s;cene. Perceiving the horrid, headle&s;s trunk, and from the garment &s;uppo&s;ing it to be O&s;myn, &s;he indulges deep grief, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ugh it appears that &s;he came re&s;olved to die, and to carry the object of af|fection to the grave with her.</P>
<P>While &s;he is in the utmo&s;t agony of mind, Selim enters, and telling her the King is no where to be found, &s;he &s;tabs him. The faithful eunuch, wi&s;h|ing to &s;ave his mi&s;tre&s;s, warns her not to drink the poi&s;on, and is going to inform her that Alphon&s;o is alive, but death checks him in the in&s;tant of in|formation. Zara proceeds to fini&s;h her weary life, but the author has run her into a &s;ad mi&s;take; be|ing a Mahometan, &s;he &s;hould not talk of her &s;pi|rit's meeting Alphon&s;o's in a future world, for in that faith women are not allowed immortality.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner is the unhappy Queen expired, but Almeria and her confidante enter; the Prince&s;s al&s;o comes to &s;eek the object of her affection; up|on
<PB N="413" REF="419">
&s;eeing the headle&s;s trunk her grief ri&s;es to a di&s;tracted height: viewing the fatal cups, &s;he deter|mines to end her cares; at the moment &s;he is go|ing to drink the poi&s;on Alphon&s;o enters, and &s;natches her from the gaping jaws of fate; the &s;urprize of joy overpowers her, and &s;he faints for the third time.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of this play draws a very moral inference, ju&s;tly ob&s;erving, that though virtue may labour under occa&s;ional cha&s;ti&s;ement, yet per&s;e|verance in rectitude cannot fail of reward. The MOURNING BRIDE has been, at different times, &s;upported by very able performance, and has drawn many brilliant audiences, yet we cannot help thinking it one of the wor&s;t living tragedies: it is apparently laboured, the &s;entiments in general &s;trained, the ver&s;ification in many places monoto|nous, and the plot equivocal.</P>
<P>In point of characters, we find the King a weak, blu&s;tering, tyrannical object; a credulous lover, and a har&s;h father. His pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially in the fourth act, are laughable, and the device which oc|ca&s;ions his death, farcical; he is altogether the mo&s;t ungracious load that ever lay heavy on the &s;houlders of a performer. The highe&s;t merit that can be attained is to pa&s;s through him inoffen&s;ive|ly, and in this view we have &s;een Mr. SPARKS. Mr. BERRY rumbled him out in a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting man|ner: why he &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon Mr. J. AICKIN, we cannot conceive, unle&s;s to prejudice his merit in public opinion, his brother's general ca&s;t and &s;tile of acting, &s;hould have royalized him in this play.</P>
<P>O&s;myn is de&s;cribed to us as a hero, but appears in no other light than that of an affectionate,
<PB N="414" REF="420">
con&s;tant hu&s;band. His &s;ituations and embarra&s;|ments rai&s;e &s;en&s;ations of pity, but being totally out of the fourth act, and &s;o immaterialiy concerned in the fir&s;t and fifth, he becomes a very imperfect hero for repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>We have &s;een Mr. SHERIDAN make Gothic at|tempts upon this part, for which he had not a &s;in|gle requi&s;ite: an in&s;ufficiency of figure, di&s;&s;onance of expre&s;&s;ion, and limitation of voice, conjoined to over&s;hadow every trace of merit. Mr. BARRY was happy enough to be the very rever&s;e of the fore|mentioned gentleman; his love, grief and rage, were all expre&s;&s;ed by very adequate powers. Mr. GARRICK, we think, in the &s;oliloquies, and the &s;cene with Heli, out&s;tripped every competitor; but the Moori&s;h habit proved rather too much for his figure, and the amorous pa&s;&s;ages did not flow from him with that natural &s;incerity, of which Mr. BAR|RY gave us an ample and very plea&s;ing idea. Mr. MOSSOP is much too mechanical and boi&s;terous, he cannot &s;hake off the ba&s;haw; he &s;hould never at|tempt any thing in the amorous &s;tile, but that &s;ul|tanic hint of dropping the handkerchief. Mr. HOLLAND &s;tiffened his deportment into a degree of aukwardne&s;s, and tortured the tones of his voice into an irk&s;ome degree of di&s;&s;onance. Mr. INCH|BALD has pre&s;ented him&s;elf in O&s;myn this &s;ea&s;on with a very &s;lender degree of credit, being in every re&s;pect much wor&s;e than any we have named, ex|cept Mr. SHERIDAN. Gonzales, like mo&s;t &s;tate&s;|men, of all ages, moves upon that ruling principle &s;elf-intere&s;t, and aggrandi&s;ement of his family. As a part he &s;tands in a &s;tate of mediocrity, neither for or again&s;t the actor: we remember to have &s;een
<PB N="415" REF="421">
him well done by Mr. HAVARD; and Mr. PACK|ER, who may be &s;tiled the <HI>Pack-hor&s;e</HI> of DRURY LANE, does him &s;ufficiently well. Mr. HULL has abilities, if required, to render the part re&s;pectable. As to all the other male characters, we &s;hall leave them to their own in&s;ignificancy.</P>
<P>Almeria, who gives name to the play, is amiable in her principles, and pitiable in her circum&s;tances; the author has run her a little into the romantic &s;train, but &s;he has the happine&s;s of opening the play with two of the be&s;t lines in the whole piece. There is a variety of acting in this part, yet her royal highne&s;s is undoubtedly too much upon the whine: no per&s;on whom we have &s;een had equal capabilities to Mrs. CIBBER for this part; Mrs. BELLAMY, though inferior in requi&s;ites, mu&s;t not be placed far behind; her painting of di&s;traction was more faint, but love and tenderne&s;s &s;he always expre&s;&s;ed with admirable feeling. Mi&s;s MACK|LIN, about &s;eventeen years ago, by the in&s;truction of, and playing with Mr. GARRICK, &s;upported Al|meria through a con&s;iderable run, with much cre|dit, and really &s;truck out &s;everal beauties; but her feelings, though correct in tragedy, always wanted the animation of expre&s;&s;ion; her voice was too thin and contracted. Mi&s;s YOUNG, whom we con|&s;ider as a ri&s;ing actre&s;s, has &s;hewn ability in the part, but we object to this lady's frequent attempts at what &s;he can't execute; &s;triving to excel is, no doubt, a laudable ambition, but as a performer &s;hould not over&s;tep the <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> of nature, no more &s;hould he or &s;he &s;train the <HI>powers</HI> of nature; it is better to be a little below, than above the point of rectitude.</P>
<P><PB N="416" REF="422">Zara is, beyond di&s;pute, the mo&s;t indelicate Queen that can well be imagined; &s;he is vicious and mean, gro&s;s in &s;entiment, and vulgar in ex|pre&s;&s;ion. Had &s;he been more delicate in the for|mer, and more re&s;erved in the latter, &s;he might have attracted &s;ome degree of humane concern; but, as &s;he is, good &s;en&s;e and decorum mu&s;t frown through the four fir&s;t acts, while ridicule attends her and the head-&s;haking mini&s;ters of death in the fifth. The author's peculiar unhappine&s;s in the cata&s;trophe of this leading character, is plainly evinced by an ob&s;ervation we have repeatedly made, that &s;carce any degree of merit can &s;ave ex|piring Zara and her di&s;mal attendants from being laughed at.</P>
<P>Mrs. WOFFINGTON's figure and deportment were well adapted to the captive Queen; but the vio|lent, as well as tender pa&s;&s;ions, grated abominably in her di&s;&s;onant voice. Mrs. PRITCHARD was ma|je&s;tic, but rather too corpulent; in &s;peaking and acting the part, &s;he &s;hewed correct and fine pre&s;er|vation of character. The amorous pa&s;&s;ages were indeed not &s;o harmonious as might be wi&s;hed, but in the jealou&s;y &s;he made ample amends.</P>
<P>We remember to have &s;een Mrs. CLIVE make a laughable a&s;&s;ault upon Zara, which was nearer burle&s;que than could well be imagined. Had it not been to excite curio&s;ity upon her night, it would have been one of the mo&s;t unpardonable at|tempts that ever was made: exclu&s;ive of a voice dreadfully unfit for &s;erious &s;peaking, her per&s;on rendered all the King's amorous compliments ludi|crous; and ju&s;tified O&s;myn's coldne&s;s, admitting
<PB N="417" REF="423">
he had no other engagement to warp his inclina|tion.</P>
<P>It is amazing that a principle of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s &s;hould cau&s;e people of great merit and good circum&s;tances, for the &s;ake of a few pounds, to exhibit them&s;elves in a contemptible point of view. Mrs. HOPKINS, who now apologizes for mo&s;t of the above excel|lent comedian's parts, makes rather a better figure in Zara, yet is bad enough, heaven knows. We have now got to the end of our remarks upon this laborious tragedy, and, without any he&s;itation, ven|ture to pronounce it, though capable of drawing tears when well acted, the wor&s;t compo&s;ition that any man of equal genius to Mr. CONGREVE ever produced.</P>

<HEAD>LOVE MAKES A MAN; OR, The FOP's FORTUNE. A COMEDY: By CIBBER.</HEAD>
<P>THE piece now offered to view took its origin from two plays of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, which we think the Laureat &s;hould have owned; but cannot find any trace of &s;uch ju&s;tice and mo|de&s;ty in his prologue: two old dons, Antonio and Charino, open this play, talking upon a marriage between one of Antonio's &s;ons and Charino's daughter; the choice of who &s;hall be his &s;on-in-law, and other matters being agreed upon, Sancho enters and pre&s;ents a letter from Carlos to his fa|ther Antonio; &s;oon after Clodio's valet appears, and in broken Engli&s;h announces his ma&s;ter's &s;peedy approach.</P>
<P>The brothers next come forward; when Clo|dio's vivacity, oppo&s;ed to Carlos's &s;tiffne&s;s, makes a favourable impre&s;&s;ion upon Charino; who though old &s;eems fond of fe&s;tivity; the Beaux's remarks upon his brother's formal univer&s;ity air improve the prejudice in his favour; Clodio retires to change his dre&s;s, which gives Antonio an oppor|tunity to con&s;ult Charles's inclination or ideas re|&s;pecting matrimony; being de&s;ired to become a
<PB N="419" REF="425">
man of the world, the ab&s;tracted &s;cholar &s;eems to point out books as the mo&s;t valuable and com|prehen&s;ive enjoyment; when told that he &s;hould marry for &s;ake of an heir to continue the family, he de&s;ires that care to be ca&s;t upon his brother, and &s;eems ambitious of nothing but exalted know|ledge.</P>
<P>This throws the matrimonial &s;cheme entirely upon Clodio, who returns and entertains the two old dons with a very whim&s;ical and plea&s;ant ac|count of the French princes and prince&s;&s;es he has been familiar with in Paris, the father, and pro|po&s;ed father-in-law enjoy his rhap&s;odical volubility &s;o highly, that Charino propo&s;es immediate intro|duction to his daughter Angelina, which Clody gladly accepts, and they go off highly plea&s;ed with each other.</P>
<P>Sancho, who has overheard the de&s;ign of &s;ettling the greater part of his ma&s;ter's inheritance upon Clodio, determines to acquaint don Lewis, Anto|nio's brother, with the matter; the cynical old blade entering ju&s;t at this point of time, and de|&s;iring to &s;ee Charles, Sancho opens the matter to him by degrees; upon hearing it he denies credit to the tale till Antonio, who comes on with a law|yer, confirms the truth of it; this cau&s;es don Lewis to u&s;e &s;ome very angry expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t Clody, and favourable ones in re&s;pect of Charles; his admiration of and regard for literary know|ledge, though he knows nothing at all of the matter him&s;elf, further than that Greek has a lofty &s;ound, is humourou&s;ly imagined.</P>
<P>There is a very grote&s;que and diverting oddity throughout this &s;cene, and the fir&s;t act concludes
<PB N="420" REF="426">
with a furious declaration of don Lewis's again&s;t the proceedings of his brother, and the hopes of his younger nephew.</P>
<P>Sancho is pre&s;ented at the beginning of the &s;e|cond act in anxious &s;ollicitation for his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, but the po&s;itive father, bent on his own determination, cuts the matter very &s;hort; then calls all his &s;ervants to prepare the wedding enter|tainment: Carlos from his &s;tudy hears an unu&s;ual bu&s;tle, the noi&s;e of which di&s;turbs him; on &s;eeing Sancho he a&s;ks the meaning of it; being told it is the cooks, he lays by his book, then enquires about his younger brother's knowledge of languages; the marriage being mentioned, Sancho gives a lu&s;|cious de&s;cription of Angelina, by way of warming his ma&s;ter's numb'd feelings.</P>
<P>Upon hearing that all his birthright is to be &s;ettled upon Clody, he bears the intelligence with philo&s;ophic patience. While he is in this &s;tate of cold re&s;ignation, the original of Sancho's picture comes on and immediately &s;trikes the &s;cholar's wondering eyes; from &s;ome &s;en&s;ible replies he re|ceives proof of her under&s;tanding, but finding him&s;elf touched more than he could wi&s;h, he retires.</P>
<P>The thought of his calling for an OVID is very characteri&s;tic and pretty; Clody, don Lewis, An|tonio, and the lawyer, now come forward; upon being bid welcome, don Lewis afre&s;h expre&s;&s;es his di&s;plea&s;ure, particularly again&s;t Clodio; concern|ing whom he &s;peaks to Angelina in very whim&s;ical terms; tired with being fretted, he goes off and returns immediately to Charles in his &s;tudy; with whom he parleys about his ill-timed negligent in|difference;
<PB N="421" REF="427">
at length he per&s;uades him to go and wi&s;h his intended &s;i&s;ter joy. Antonio enters with the lawyer to get Charles's ratification of his in|tended &s;ettlement, which he promi&s;es to execute; but wi&s;hing to do it in pre&s;ence of the lady, they retire for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Charino, Angelina, Clody, a lawyer and prie&s;t next appear; don Lewis hints again to Angelina his di&s;like of her match. Carlos enters with his father, and confe&s;&s;es upon the &s;econd view of his purpo&s;ed &s;i&s;ter, tho&s;e affectionate &s;en&s;ations which dawn'd at the fir&s;t &s;ight of her.</P>
<P>Upon &s;aluting Angelina, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf with all the warmth of rapture; &s;he &s;ympathizes, which occa&s;ions him to declare that he could wi&s;h his brother happy with any other beauty: here Antonio and Charino interpo&s;e, while don Lewis encourages his nephew's amorous feelings, and &s;eems determined to defend his claim.</P>
<P>The interruptions of Clody, and the replies of don Lewis, are very laughable; there is &s;omething plea&s;ingly delicate in Carlos's readine&s;s to &s;acrifice his own views and happine&s;s, to the lady's real in|clination if again&s;t him. At length finding, as far as mode&s;ty will permit, that &s;he pronounces him the man of her heart, he re&s;olves to &s;upport the privilege of encouraged love; and being rou&s;ed by a challenge which Clody gives, he decides the matter by di&s;arming his confident coxcombly bro|ther, and carrying off the lady.</P>
<P>Her father highly enraged pur&s;ues, and the vanqui&s;hed Clody is left in a very whim&s;ical &s;itua|tion; here the plot takes a romantic and unpar|donable turn; finding that don Lewis, Carlos,
<PB N="422" REF="428">
and Angelina have got on board &s;hip, the two fa|thers and Clody re&s;olve to pur&s;ue them; thus af|fairs are &s;tated at the conclu&s;ion of the &s;econd act; between which and the beginning of the third, we are &s;afely, though not very probably, conveyed to Li&s;bon, where we encounter don Duart the go|vernor, and Elvira, &s;i&s;ter to the former.</P>
<P>From what pa&s;&s;es we find the don is a mo&s;t fu|rious creature, violently prone to quarrel on ridi|culous, chimerical notions of honour; being ad||vi&s;ed to a moderation of temper, he flounces off with a degree of brutal pa&s;&s;ion: here a &s;cene fol|lows which is generally omitted, but we think ne|ce&s;&s;ary for explanation of the plot; as by it we know how Angelina has come on &s;hore, and by what means &s;he is placed in Loui&s;a's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the next &s;cene we meet Loui&s;a and Ho|noria returning from ve&s;pers. From what the former drops, it appears that her devotion has been interrupted by the &s;ight of a mo&s;t engaging young man; here don Lewis and Carlos enter; the for|mer mentions their narrow e&s;cape from drowning, and their impoveri&s;hed circum&s;tances; the latter &s;eems to think the&s;e matters of trivial concern, compared with the lo&s;s of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>His tenderne&s;s impre&s;&s;es Loui&s;a, &s;he re&s;olves to &s;et a watch upon his &s;teps, and for the pre&s;ent, under cover of a veil, gives him a pur&s;e to relieve their nece&s;&s;ity; don Lewis, at &s;ight of the gold, concludes her &s;ome woman of great fortune in love with Charles; and upon very mean, mercenary principles advi&s;es him to ca&s;t a&s;ide the remem|brance of his fir&s;t love, for &s;ake of the emolu|ment which pre&s;ents it&s;elf; however Charles un|touched
<PB N="423" REF="429">
with the avarice of age, and con&s;tant in his affections, rejects &s;o unworthy a propo&s;ition, re&s;olving to &s;earch for his lo&s;t Angelina.</P>
<P>Antonio and Charino appear next upon a hot &s;cent of the run-aways; Clody joins them in the utmo&s;t anxiety for the lo&s;s of a favourite &s;nuff-box; this concern for &s;o trifling an object, when the lo&s;s of a daughter and bride claims notice, &s;eems to abate Charino's favourable opinion of his de&s;igned &s;on-in-law.</P>
<P>The old fellows go off on their pur&s;uit, Clodio &s;tays behind looking for his toy; while he is thus employed a page, preceding don Duart, orders him out of his ma&s;ter's way, the don him&s;elf com|ing up Clody banters him with plea&s;antry; a blow given, brings on a tilting match, wherein Clodio wounds and brings his violent antagoni&s;t to the ground.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething ungenerou&s;ly cruel in Clo|dio's ludicrous remark of  <Q REND="inline">"having never fenced better in his life;"</Q> a man of real courage, and Clody though a fop might be &s;uch, will never ex|ult over a pro&s;trate, much le&s;s an expiring foe; an alarm being given by the page, and in con&s;e|quence a hue-and-cry rai&s;ed, the conqueror finds it prudent to &s;eek &s;afety in flight; accordingly he e&s;capes by a precipitate retreat from the officers of ju&s;tice, who upon &s;eeing don Duart think he has only received his de&s;erts; however they take up the body in order to convey it to his &s;i&s;ter's.</P>
<P>Don Lewis and Carlos now enter, having had &s;ome notice of Angelina; Carlos is forced by Loui&s;a's emi&s;&s;aries into a chair, and don Lewis violently dragged after him, with a gag in his
<PB N="424" REF="430">
mouth; the next &s;cene places us in Elvira's cham|ber, where we find the young lady preparing for devotion, and very oddly ordering <HI>all the lights</HI> away, as, according to her own meaning, &s;he can meditate without light.</P>
<P>Clodio having perceived the door of this lady's hou&s;e open, in the hurry of flight makes it a re|fuge, and &s;teals into the chamber where &s;he is; being heard by her, &s;he mo&s;t unaccountably enters into conver&s;ation with a &s;trange man, in the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious circum&s;tances, whom &s;he cannot even &s;ee; we are at a lo&s;s to know whether &s;he &s;hews mo&s;t folly or re&s;olution in her behaviour; if the latter it is not very delicate or characteri&s;tic.</P>
<P>Immediately upon confe&s;&s;ing that the officers are at his heels for having killed an antagoni&s;t, though in &s;elf-defence, &s;he by a violent &s;tretch of huma|nity pities, and affords him protection; &s;he indeed palliates her proceeding by an ob&s;ervation that her ra&s;h brother may want &s;uch indulgence; no &s;ooner is Clody placed in a &s;ecure retreat than his pur&s;uers enter with don Duart's body.</P>
<P>Here Elvira receives a violent &s;hock from the &s;ight of a dead brother, and the in&s;tantaneous conviction that &s;he has taken the murderer under her care; &s;he indulges proper concern, but deter|mines to keep her vow of protection to the un|known per&s;on. Clodio interprets this very unde|&s;erved, and culpable favour as a proof that &s;he has a tender for his per&s;on; but how he could &s;up|po&s;e that, as &s;he has never &s;een him, we cannot tell; after the governors are gone &s;he calls Clody forth, and de&s;ires him to take advantage of the
<PB N="425" REF="431">
night for his e&s;cape; this he gladly complies with, but intimates a future de&s;ign upon his protectre&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;ucceeding &s;cene carries us to Loui&s;a's hou&s;e; that lady enquires whether her orders have been obeyed; being told that the gentlemen are &s;ecured, &s;he orders that all pa&s;&s;ages of egre&s;s may be &s;hut up, and a &s;trict &s;ilence ob&s;erved; upon Carlos's enquiring why he has been forceably con|veyed he knows not whither, Jaques declines a reply, and leaves him with his uncle, whom he finds gagged on the floor, and who&s;e dumb lan|guage he does not under&s;tand.</P>
<P>Jaques however returns and relea&s;es don Lewis; Charles and the old man upon &s;eeing each other feel &s;ome comfort, though both of them are puz|zled to find out what the treatment they have met with proceeds from; while they are expre&s;&s;ing a mixture of doubt and apprehen&s;ion the &s;ervants re-enter with an entertainment, the &s;ight of which &s;eems to remove every di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation from don Lewis's mind; he refre&s;hes him&s;elf very hear|tily, but cannot per&s;uade Charles to partake; after &s;upper it is intimated that he mu&s;t retire, he obeys with a kind of whim&s;ical reluctance.</P>
<P>The old don, &s;u&s;picious of &s;omewhat extraordi|nary, gropes his way to a window, from whence he &s;ees Loui&s;a encounter Charles; this fair dame with very little re&s;erve, nay we might &s;ay licentiou&s;ne&s;s, confe&s;&s;es and urges her amorous inclination; &s;he pre&s;ents him with jewels as a token of affection, and u&s;es every method of tender per&s;ua&s;ion but in vain; the con&s;tant and di&s;intere&s;ted lover rejects her propo&s;als and flies her temptations precipi|tately; this naturally enrages her, and don Lewis,
<PB N="426" REF="432">
who has wi&s;hed an accommodation of matters agreeable to her de&s;ires, determines to try if he can't talk her into good humour; but his attempt is made in &s;uch ful&s;ome, though laughable terms, and is &s;o far un&s;ucce&s;sful, that Loui&s;a orders him to be again gagged, tied neck and heels, and thrown into a garret.</P>
<P>Carlos enters endeavouring to find a way for his e&s;cape but cannot effect it; in his progre&s;s from chamber to chamber he accidentally gets into that where Angelina is alone, meditating upon the aenigmatical behaviour of the people &s;he has got among&s;t; Carlos &s;eeing a lady alone hopes to make her a friend, his voice &s;trikes Angelina's ear with a well known &s;ound, &s;he turns upon him and fills him with joyful a&s;toni&s;hment; Jaques who has un|perceived traced Carlos's &s;teps, goes to inform his lady of the interview he has been witne&s;s of.</P>
<P>He &s;oon returns with Loui&s;a, who hears their mutual declarations of love, and al&s;o hears &s;ome &s;evere &s;trictures upon her&s;elf; finding an e&s;cape meditated, &s;purred by jealou&s;y, di&s;appointed love and pride, &s;he takes preventive mea&s;ures; however not time enough to hinder Carlos from getting over the garden wall; the lady feels this incident &s;trongly but finds &s;ome comfort in the idea of his returning within an hour, when &s;he re&s;olves that vengeance &s;hall wait and intercept him.</P>
<P>The next &s;cene introduces us to Clodio and Du|art who meet in the &s;treet; it appears that the latter has been &s;eeking after the former; to what end will appear by what follows: a conver&s;ation en&s;ues, rather general than particular, and a bottle of wine is called for, we think a little oddly, in the
<PB N="427" REF="433">
&s;treet; Clody's account of gallantry in different nations is certainly licentious, and in our idea vul|gar; he may divert di&s;&s;ipated minds, but cannot be acceptable to good &s;en&s;e and delicacy.</P>
<P>His duel with don Duart falls in as a part of di&s;cour&s;e, but why he &s;hould mention &s;o dangerous an incident to a perfect &s;tranger is very irreconcile|able; when don Duart confe&s;&s;es a thorough know|ledge of the affair, he &s;eems alarmed; but gives up apprehen&s;ion at an a&s;&s;urance that he is free from all danger; why don Duart &s;hould give Clody a pur&s;e, and why a man of his figure &s;hould accept of it, is not ea&s;ily accounted for, however thus we find it; and Clodio in the fullne&s;s of confidence, manife&s;ting a very weak and uncautious head, communicates to his new friend Elvira's humane protection of him, which his vanity interprets love.</P>
<P>Don Duart feels very ju&s;t re&s;entment at &s;uch be|haviour as his &s;i&s;ter's appears to him, and under|takes to carry a letter that he may come more par|ticularly at the real feelings of Elvira; thus con|cludes the fourth act.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fifth, we perceive the lady, la&s;t mentioned, in a &s;tate of deep mourning and profound melancholly; don Duart enters in di&s;gui&s;e and delivers the letter; in order to effect that ju&s;tice for a brother's death which her ra&s;h vow of protection prevented, &s;he &s;eems to receive the addre&s;s of her gallant favourably; to draw him within her power &s;he expre&s;&s;es to the me&s;&s;enger rapturous wi&s;hes for his appearance, and propo&s;es an&s;wering his letter; this behaviour fills the brother with rage, which however he &s;uppre&s;&s;es till more
<PB N="428" REF="434">
&s;ub&s;tantial proof of her unnatural hypocri&s;y can be made out.</P>
<P>We next meet Loui&s;a and Jaques; &s;he enquires if Angelina is &s;eized; being an&s;wered in the affir|mative, &s;he orders that when the &s;tranger is taken al&s;o, immediate intelligence may be brought to her; &s;he has a &s;hort &s;oliloquy expre&s;&s;ive of her re|&s;entment at being &s;lighted for one &s;he calls a girl; at the end of which intelligence is brought that the cold object of her affection is &s;eized; Carlos di|rectly appears in a &s;tate of captivity; after a few lines of upbraiding, Loui&s;a vindictively orders a door to be opened which &s;hews Angelina in the Turki&s;h &s;tate of a bow-&s;tring, on the point of being &s;trangled; the &s;ituation of Carlos and his innocent mi&s;tre&s;s here grows very pathetic, while Loui&s;a's tyrannical exultation over their di&s;tre&s;s renders her for &s;ome time a very hateful object; at length melt|ed by the &s;upplications of the man &s;he has impro|perly fixed her de&s;ires upon, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;es the bra|voes, and re&s;tores the unhappy lovers to mutual affection and peace. This is an unexpected and plea&s;ing turn, but rather deficient in probability; for if CONGREVE's maxim, which we are apt to ad|mit, be right; that
<Q><L>"Earth has no plague like love to hatred turn'd;</L>
<L>"Nor hell a fury like a woman &s;corn'd."</L></Q>
This favourable turn of affairs &s;eems brought about unaccountably; yet be it as it may, it has a &s;atis|factory effect upon the audience, and &s;oftens the di&s;agreeable view of a female mon&s;ter, which hi|therto Loui&s;a has invariably appeared.</P>
<P>Carlos having returned thanks for deliverance, enquires after his uncle don Lewis, who is ordered
<PB N="429" REF="435">
in; the old gentleman, upon &s;eeing Charles, for|gets his pa&s;t ill treatment, and enjoys the plea&s;ing circum&s;tance of meeting his nephew; &s;eeing Loui&s;a he begs excu&s;e for his freedom at a former meet|ing; being introduced to Angelina he expre&s;&s;es his &s;atisfaction in very whim&s;ical terms.</P>
<P>The governor is here introduced, who comes to &s;earch for Carlos and Angelina upon the oaths of their pur&s;uers; Loui&s;a be&s;peaks his favour for the lovers, which he promi&s;es; Charino now comes forward, with Antonio and Clody; he appears in a violent heat, demanding of ju&s;tiee, while Antonio acknowledges a reconciliation to Charles's proceed|ing, and gives the young pair his ble&s;&s;ing: this ir|ritates Angelina's te&s;ty father a-fre&s;h; &s;he interpo&s;es with mode&s;t, emphatic per&s;ua&s;ion, which however he makes no immediate reply to; don Duart enters and pre&s;ents Clodio with the an&s;wer to his letter; finding it kind, he re&s;igns all claim to Angelina, and invites the company to his wedding with the lady Elvira.</P>
<P>The &s;cene now changes to her hou&s;e, where all the characters &s;oon appear; Clodio approaches her in terms of &s;pirited nothingne&s;s, and introduces the whole company to her; when matters are at the point of an agreeable conclu&s;ion, Elvira calls the officers of ju&s;tice whom &s;he has placed in wait|ing, and demands from the governor ju&s;tice on the murderer of her brother; here circum&s;tances are thrown into confu&s;ion; Charino finding Clody's dilemma, receives Charles as his &s;on-in-law; and don Lewis with great humour, though very little humanity, diverts him&s;elf at his unhappy nephew's expence, till don Duart's di&s;covering him&s;elf gives
<PB N="430" REF="436">
a plea&s;ing explanation, and renders all the parties agreeable to each other.</P>
<P>After painfully toiling through this piece, which is highly offen&s;ive in many places to critici&s;m, we are to expre&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment that a per&s;on &s;o well ac|quainted with the drama, both as a writer and a performer, &s;hould have plunged into &s;uch unju&s;ti|fiable irregularity: even in hi&s;torical tragedies, where importance of events and dignity of cha|racters may in &s;ome &s;hape apologize for a breach of the unities, violent tre&s;pa&s;&s;es are not admi&s;&s;ible; how much le&s;s &s;o in a repre&s;entation of private life, where only common tran&s;actions are exhibited; but the laureat &s;eems to have &s;tudied character alone in this play, and con&s;ideration will &s;hew that he has in his favourite point rather caracatured than followed nature.</P>
<P>The two old gentlemen, Antonio and Charino, are very whim&s;ical fathers; the former wants to have one of his &s;ons married by way of continuing the family; which of them fulfils this natural duty he does not &s;eem to care, and upon Charles's de|clining a connection &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with his ab&s;tract ideas, very tenderly attempts to &s;trip him of his birthright.</P>
<P>Charino is violently fond of his daughter, wants to &s;ee her happy, yet never con&s;ults her inclination re&s;pecting the mo&s;t material concern of human life; he takes a fancy to the o&s;tentatious, unmean|ing rattle of a &s;pirited coxcomb, and immediately &s;ets him down as a mo&s;t de&s;ireable &s;on-in-law; without any other recommendation than a vivacity, and that rather licentious, &s;eldom agreeable to de|clining age, there being nothing material in the
<PB N="431" REF="437">
repre&s;entation of the&s;e two characters, and indeed many more parts of this play, we cannot charge our recollection with any but the three leading ones.</P>
<P>Don Lewis is a very extraordinary creature, he &s;eems to have good nature, but then it appears to be merely founded upon the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition; he is peevi&s;h and po&s;itive, more of a humori&s;t than an object of e&s;teem; many of his expre&s;&s;ions, though gro&s;s, are laughable; the mode of per|forming this part is a cynic dryne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion, which we are apt to think Mr. MACKLIN hit off more happily than any other performer we have &s;een; he was extremely plea&s;ant without being co|mical; his retorts upon Clodio were inimitably contra&s;ted; Mr. YATES is no le&s;s cha&s;te and cor|rect; but wants an equal degree of force: Mr. SHUTER manife&s;ts a glow of uncharacteri&s;tic good nature, and plays off too many variations of fea|ture; he &s;eems too &s;en&s;ible of his own humour, and palpably chuckles where he &s;hould leave that totally to the audience.</P>
<P>Clodio is made up of rhap&s;odical volatility; he appears to have no idea beyond the character of courage and volatility; he &s;eems ready to addre&s;s any woman, or to fight with any man: intrigue, marriage or duelling are all alike to him; he is thrown into a variety of whim&s;ical &s;ituations, and mu&s;t be allowed a mo&s;t favourable part for any actor who has &s;uitable capabilities.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding Mr. THE. CIBBER mu&s;t have collected many advantageous ideas from the origi|nal, his father, and author of the piece; we never could think him &s;ufficiently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of negligent &s;prightline&s;s; he too often mixed the formal ele|gance
<PB N="432" REF="438">
of a Foppington, and &s;unk the coxcomb in the man of fa&s;hion; he had al&s;o an unpardona|ble fault which di&s;graced many of his principal characters; that was making ludicrous faces, more adapted to Abel Drugger than any cla&s;s of genti|lity: to Mr. WOODWARD's Clody we give a great preference; as, to us, his figure, deportment and expre&s;&s;ion, fill up every &s;atisfactory idea; he makes u&s;e of &s;ome theatrical manoeuvres, which &s;eem more calculated to catch the million than critical judgement, but as they are upon the whole inno|cent baits to gain applau&s;e, we do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to particularize them. If plea&s;ing the majority be the actor's mo&s;t profitable con&s;idera|tion, as certainly it is, this gentleman may be de|fended in mo&s;t, if not all of his outr&eacute; &s;trokes; the theatre frequently verifies what Cimberton remarks;
<Q><L>"Nature's too &s;imple, of all art bereav'd;</L>
<L>"If the world will, why let it be deceiv'd."</L></Q>
Mr. KING has every plea&s;ing and e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite for Clody, but we never had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee him perform it.</P>
<P>Carlos, as a &s;tudent, is mo&s;t formally pedantic, totally unacquainred with life; as a lover, enthu|&s;ia&s;tically amorous and romantic; he has courage when called upon, and appears not only con&s;tant in his affection, but commendably di&s;intere&s;ted in his love; he is, through the former part of the play, a &s;ubject of e&s;teem, in the latter an object of pity; we re&s;pect though we cannot admire.</P>
<P>As a part he is not very favourable to the actor, as &s;ome of his &s;cenes are incumbered with a tedi|ous &s;amene&s;s.; Mr. DEXTER, who had very much of the gentleman in his appearance and expre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="433" REF="439">
filled up this part &s;ome years ago with very plea&s;ing ability, yet we mu&s;t give a preference to Mr. ROSS's requi&s;ites, ere his per&s;on increa&s;ed beyond the idea of a &s;tudious life; Mr. BENSLEY is lean enough, but wants the &s;oft flow of expre&s;&s;ion, and philo&s;ophical compo&s;ure of look, which &s;hould picture Carlos; he is too au&s;tere in the beginning, and too boi&s;terous where the pa&s;&s;ions come in: we remember one Mr. W. GIFFARD marching on for this part &s;ome fifteen years ago at Covent-Garden, who had &s;o much of the antique paternal pompo|&s;ity &s;tamped on his performance, that in &s;ome places he might have pa&s;&s;ed for Alexander; in others for Bajazet; now Cato, then Ca&s;talio, all exaggerated: &s;uch gro&s;s violations of nature, &s;uch an unharmonious gallimaufry of acting, &s;ure never was &s;een, and can hardly be conceived.</P>
<P>Elvira and Angelina are very lukewarm ladies, e&s;pecially the former, who is much more of a fool than a philo&s;opher; if any thing can be made of Angelina in repre&s;entation, Mrs. BULKLEY's talents appear well adapted to make the burthen agree|able.</P>
<P>Loui&s;a is as contemptible a female as we know; gro&s;sly licentious, and naturally cruel in her tem|per; indeed &s;he &s;oftens at la&s;t, and throws off the mon&s;ter; but we think that &s;ince &s;o unworthy a female was introduced, it would have been but barely con&s;onant to public ju&s;tice to have puni&s;hed her in &s;ome manner &s;uitable to her culpable beha|viour; in&s;tead of which, &s;he is allowed to huddle up an advantageous match with a worthy man, who has addre&s;&s;ed her for years: Mrs. HAMILTON did this lady great ju&s;tice; we may &s;ay entered too
<PB N="434" REF="440">
far into the author's meaning, for it is blameable to exhibit offen&s;ive pictures of nature in &s;trong co|lours.</P>
<P>When we look back upon this piece, we mu&s;t again cen&s;ure and lament Mr. CIBBER's hardine&s;s to venture and work upon &s;o pantomimical a plot, highly improbable and gro&s;sly irregular; the &s;enti|ments, in many parts of this comedy, convey gro&s;s ideas; many of the &s;cenes are too long, others to|tally in&s;ignificant: the dialogue is natural and &s;prightly, though void of wit and elegance; the moral very vague, lying wholly in this, that the pa&s;&s;ion of love will in&s;pire a man to rou&s;e up prin|ciples of rea&s;on and action, which, till he feels that pa&s;&s;ion, lie dormant in his brea&s;t: what utility is inculcated hereby, we know not; but this we know, that young minds may be prejudiced by the capital figure in this piece of theatrical paint|ing.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if an audience chu&s;e merely to laugh, the FOP's FORTUNE, when well performed, will gratify that wi&s;h; but we cannot by any means recommend it to peru&s;al; if in the clo&s;et it e&s;capes tainting the mind, which we doubt, it may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that no in&s;truction can be derived from the piece.</P>

<P>ORESTES, the &s;on of Agamemnon, in cha|racter of amba&s;&s;ador from &s;everal Grecian &s;tates, opens this piece meeting mo&s;t unexpectedly, and with much joy, his faithful friend Pylades, from whom he had been &s;eparated by a &s;torm at &s;ea; his appearance and &s;plendid retinue occa&s;ion friend|ly congratulation upon the apparent favourable rever&s;e of fortune; but we find that an amorous feeling damps any plea&s;ure which might be de|rived from the eminence of his &s;tation.</P>
<P>Pylades expre&s;&s;es &s;urprize and concern at this painful weakne&s;s, e&s;pecially as he &s;uppo&s;ed his princely intimate long &s;ince freed from &s;uch an ef|feminating bondage.

Ore&s;tes in this &s;cene &s;hews him&s;elf a man of very violent pa&s;&s;ions, and therefore ill calculated for public tru&s;t; a gleam of hope breaks in upon the agitated lover, on being informed that a preference &s;hewn to Andromache by Pyrrhus, occa&s;ions Her|mione to turn her thoughts from the cold monarch to her fir&s;t lover's tran&s;ports.</P>
<P>Here Pyrrhus enters to give audience; when Ore&s;tes delivers his addre&s;s, in as manly, nervous, and plau&s;ible terms, as the &s;ubject of it will admit; a great &s;hare of dignified humanity breaks forth from Pyrrhus in his replies; his determination to guard the fatherle&s;s and widow, amid&s;t every peril, would manife&s;t true magnanimity of mind, but that we find an amorous inclination at the bottom of it; after many remon&s;trances, the amba&s;&s;ador &s;ounds Pyrrhus re&s;pecting Hermione; the mo|narch's an&s;wer is doubtful, however he &s;ends Ore&s;tes upon the agreeable errand of &s;eeing the idol of his heart.</P>
<P>Upon Phoenix's ob&s;ervation to Pyrrhus, that he is encouraging a rival, he expre&s;&s;es a de&s;ire of be|ing, freed from the Prince&s;s, at any rate; here An|dromache and her con&s;idante Cephi&s;a approach; the former being addre&s;&s;ed by Pyrrhus, &s;he weep|ingly turns the di&s;cour&s;e to her &s;on A&s;tyanax: mention of him occa&s;ions the king to tell her what the Grecian &s;tates demand; &s;he claims protection, which he promi&s;es, but taxed with a provi&s;o of having his love returned.</P>
<P>His propo&s;itions are ardent and flattering, but the royal widow's inflexible attachment to the me|mory of her fir&s;t lord, thwarts his views and &s;ol|licitations, in&s;omuch that he &s;hews re&s;entment, but

gives her time for con&s;ideration; de&s;iring &s;he may vi&s;it the child, and reflect while &s;he is embracing him, whether to become a queen, and &s;ave her darling boy, or remain deaf to intreaty, and lo&s;e him by an ob&s;tinate per&s;i&s;tance in widowhood.</P>
<P>Andromache in a &s;hort, pathetic &s;oliloquy, founded more on ma&s;culine heroi&s;m than maternal tenderne&s;s, &s;eems to re&s;olve upon his fate, and expre&s;&s;es a determination to &s;hare it; thus ends the fir&s;t act.</P>
<P>Hermione begins the &s;econd with her attendant Cleone, whom we perceive to be a partner of her bo&s;om &s;ecrets; it appears that the prince&s;s had re|fu&s;ed an audience to Ore&s;tes, but by per&s;ua&s;ion now agrees with his reque&s;t; a point of confu&s;ion, wrought by her &s;en&s;e of the unworthy treat|ment &s;he has given him, occa&s;ioned the refu&s;al, and a &s;park of pride that he &s;hould find her in a foreign court, neglected by the man to whom &s;he is be|trothed, &s;trengthens her di&s;tre&s;s of mind; being irritated again&s;t Pyrrhus by Cleone, &s;he determines, amid&s;t the warmth of jealous re&s;entment, to take the advantage of Ore&s;tes's amba&s;&s;y, and, under his care, once again to &s;eek her father's kingdom.</P>
<P>This prince&s;s, though &s;omewhat ju&s;tified by the idea of a rival, triumphs rather too vindictively over the unhappy mother and her di&s;tracted &s;on; her pa&s;&s;ion for Pyrrhus appears very warm, though her &s;en&s;ibility perceives and allows the merit of Ore&s;tes. Here the amba&s;&s;ador makes his appear|ance, and paints his &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s, yet unabating pa&s;|&s;ion, in very emphatic terms; hearing that Pyr|rhus refu&s;es to deliver up A&s;tyanax, her jealous re&s;entment kindles a-fre&s;h, and &s;he cheers her lover's
<PB N="438" REF="444">
drooping &s;pirits with &s;ome tender expre&s;&s;ions; but upon being told by him that Pyrrhus neglects her charms, wounded pride confe&s;&s;es impatient feel|ings, and Ore&s;tes falls under blame for &s;ugge&s;ting an idea &s;o mortifying to beauty.</P>
<P>After &s;everal &s;truggles and changes of pa&s;&s;ion &s;he re&s;olves, unle&s;s Pyrrhus delivers up the captive boy, to return with Ore&s;tes; this gives the prince &s;ingular &s;atisfaction, as he cannot &s;uppo&s;e compli|ance from the monarch; Pyrrhus approaches, and to the amba&s;&s;ador's great a&s;toni&s;hment, con&s;ents to the demand made by the Grecians. Thunder|&s;truck with &s;o unexpected a change, Ore&s;tes makes a confu&s;ed, and indeed very uncharacteri&s;tic reply; the agitation of his mind is much increa&s;ed by Pyrrhus's declaration, that he will, on the &s;ucceed|ing day, receive Hermione as his bride, and from Ore&s;tes, as repre&s;entative of her father. Pyrrhus having gained a momentary triumph over his pre|judice in favour of Andromache, boa&s;t of it in &s;uch a &s;tile that his bo&s;om coun&s;ellor Phoenix, who &s;ees with the di&s;cerning eyes of unimpa&s;&s;ioned age, &s;eems to think his &s;truggles like tho&s;e of a lion in the foils, which only &s;erve to entangle him more deeply; the &s;tate&s;man expre&s;&s;es his doubts, which the royal lover deems ill grounded, though he is ob|liged to &s;lip out an acknowledgement, how difficult it is to root up a &s;ettled attachment from the heart; the &s;econd act concludes with a &s;imile too flowery and poetical for an agitated mind.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the third act we meet the two friends, Pylades and Ore&s;tes, the latter vio|lently lamenting his wayward fate, the former en|deavouring, by cool per&s;ua&s;ion, to appea&s;e his pa&s;|&s;ions;
<PB N="439" REF="445">
which however hurry on to the de&s;perate and unju&s;tifiable extremity of hearing his mi&s;tre&s;s off by force: being made &s;en&s;ible how contrary to his &s;tation and public faith &s;uch an act would be, he reque&s;ts Pylades to take charge of A&s;tya|nax, while he re&s;olves to undertake the enterprize alone; but rather than &s;uffer this, his faithful companion re&s;olves to &s;hare the enterprize however dangerous and culpable.</P>
<P>This point &s;ettled, Hermione enters, and is ac|quainted by Ore&s;tes that Pyrrhus has con&s;ented to e&s;pou&s;e her; though &s;he doubts the principle on which the monarch's &s;udden change is founded, yet &s;he appears extremely willing to embrace it. Ore&s;tes goes off with a &s;eeming reconciliation to the circum&s;tance, upon which, like a true woman, &s;he &s;eems nettled that her old lover &s;hould &s;o tamely yield his hopes to the new one; however the approaching gratification of her real inclination di&s;&s;ipates the tran&s;ient cloud into &s;miles of joy, and &s;he breaks into a rapturous elogium on the heroi&s;m of her intended bridegroom.</P>
<P>Andromache here with untimely grief comes upon the prince&s;s, and in very moving terms &s;ol|licits her interpo&s;ition in favour of A&s;tyanax; to which &s;he makes a cold and rather di&s;dainful re|ply, that concludes with an in&s;ulting taunt, the offspring of a little, rather than a great mind, which latter &s;pecies maintains dignity even in re|&s;entment.</P>
<P>Soon after Hermione retires, Pyrrhus enters en|quiring for her; perceiving him di&s;tant, Andro|mache's fears for her child increa&s;e, and for &s;ome time &s;he wants re&s;olution to addre&s;s him on the
<PB N="440" REF="446">
&s;ubject; this he interprets coldne&s;s tinctured with pride; &s;he makes a motion to retire, which occa|&s;ions him to mention, with &s;ome degree of ruffled temper, the &s;urrender of her &s;on; &s;o heart-wound|ing a circum&s;tance gets the better of mode&s;t, timid re&s;erve, and &s;he &s;ues for pity.</P>
<P>Pyrrhus &s;u&s;tains her &s;upplications for &s;ome time with unmoved firmne&s;s; at length, touched with her plaints, he orders their attendants to with|draw, then explains the &s;tate of his own heart, and his political concerns; tells her he is ready to &s;end away Hermione, even at the utmo&s;t peril of vin|dictive nations, if &s;he will become partner of his bed; he retires with again, and finally, &s;ubmitting to her choice, meeting him in the temple, or lo&s;ing her &s;on for ever.</P>
<P>Brought to this painful dilemma, &s;he recapitu|lates &s;ome very powerful motives for declining a marriage with Pyrrhus, who was a main agent in the de&s;truction of her former hu&s;band Hector, his family and country; however maternal feelings at length prevail, &s;he gives up every other con&s;idera|tion to the pre&s;ervation of her &s;on, and then rhimes her&s;elf off with more jingle than meaning.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the fourth act we again meet the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mourner confirming the re&s;olu|tion ju&s;t mentioned, and hinting to Cephi&s;a &s;ome &s;ecret de&s;ign which demands her confidence: mat|ters thus &s;ettled, &s;he goes off to be robed for roy|alty, and &s;eems for the pre&s;ent to wear a heart &s;omewhat lightened of its mortifying load. Her|mione now pre&s;ents her&s;elf with a countenance full of &s;ullen and vindictive &s;orrow; it appears &s;he has heard of the intended nuptials, and enquires for

<P>He very ju&s;tly remon&s;trates again&s;t a proceeding &s;o contrary to the law of nations, as for him to make an a&s;&s;ault upon a monarch who has ho&s;pitably and honourably received him in the confidential &s;tile of an amba&s;&s;ador; however, the re&s;ult of this conference &s;hews, that a truly jealous woman is not to be per&s;uaded by rea&s;on nor humanity, and that a man totally en&s;laved by love is liable to commit the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable actions, under per|&s;ua&s;ion of the object he adores.</P>
<P>After Ore&s;tes retires to execute the dire com|mand Hermione has enjoined, &s;he triumphs in the idea of vengeance, but &s;eeing Pyrrhus approach, immediately &s;oftens from her &s;anguinary purpo&s;es, and &s;ends Cleone after Ore&s;tes; a &s;hort &s;cene en|&s;ues between her and the monarch, when being again enraged by his coldne&s;s, &s;he goes off with threats of fatal tendency.</P>
<P>Phoenix after her departure expre&s;&s;es fear of his ma&s;ter's &s;afety, while Pyrrhus, intoxicated with love, has no apprehen&s;ion but for the &s;afety of Andromache and her &s;on: the intended queen, decked in the magnificence of bridal garments, next appears; however the mental gloom &s;eems invariably fixed, and we perceive that external grandeur, often the ca&s;e, is but the covering of internal &s;orrow.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="448">She relates with feminine credulity a dream, from whence &s;he forms the gloomy re&s;olution, which was very common in her days, of ending her cares by &s;uicide, after &s;he had &s;ecured A&s;tyanax's life by fulfilling her promi&s;e to Pyrrhus; this may have a portion of heathen heroi&s;m and delicacy in it, but wants our idea of true re&s;olution, which makes it cowardice to fly cares by &s;uch means, and maternal tenderne&s;s, which will encounter any difficulty to watch the tender years of an infant offspring, &s;he concludes the fourth act with a&s;&s;imi|lating her&s;elf to a victim going to &s;acrifice, a &s;enti|ment very trite, but well enough applied to her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Act the fifth commences with Hermione in &s;o|liloquy, full of horrors at having doomed the ob|ject of her affection to death; there is great va|riety of acting merit in this &s;peech, and the ago|nizing throws of a mind torn between love, jea|lou&s;y, revenge and repentance, are pictured &s;trik|ingly by the pencil of nature. Cleone comes to the aid of her unhappy mi&s;tre&s;s, and rou&s;es up her vengeance, by de&s;cribing Pyrrhus's progre&s;s to the temple, and the mortifying &s;atisfaction which &s;hone in his countenance; borne beyond every de|gree of calm reflection, or patient &s;ufferance, &s;he indulges the mo&s;t ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion, and re|news her vindictive threats with double fury.

<PB N="443" REF="449">
in the fullne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t Ore&s;tes, for having &s;o readily obeyed the precipitate order of unthink|ing jealou&s;y; the amba&s;&s;ador vainly endeavours to vindicate his proceeding, while &s;he leaves him with mo&s;t virulent terms of reprobation.</P>
<P>In &s;oliloquy he reflects upon him&s;elf for being hurried by love into &s;o unju&s;tifiable an action, e&s;|pecially for one &s;o ready to accu&s;e him of the mi&s;|chief occa&s;ioned by her&s;elf; Pylades entering urges the prince to a nece&s;&s;ary retreat: lo&s;t to all feelings for his own &s;afety, he determines to remain at all events with Hermione. Hearing from his friend that the unhappy fair one has expired on the corp&s;e of the decea&s;ed monarch, his rea&s;on gives way to accumulating horrors, and at length re&s;igns its throne to the mo&s;t furious di&s;traction; a variety of unconnected images di&s;tract his ideas, till at length nature yielding to &s;uch heart-racking &s;truggles, he is borne off void of all &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Phoenix enters with guards &s;eeking the Grecian a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins who have fled; Andromache comes for|ward, who declares that vengeance &s;hall be taken of the faithle&s;s Greeks; then gives orders for the funeral of Pyrrhus, and concludes the play with that common, but moral inference; that the inno|cent, however oppre&s;&s;ed, meet when they lea&s;t ex|pect it, effectual comfort and relief.</P>
<P>To con&s;ider this tragedy at large, we find it cri|tically regular, both in the plot and connection of &s;cenes, which perhaps takes from it a portion of &s;pirit that plays better &s;upplied with bu&s;ine&s;s ma|nife&s;t; it is &s;o thin of characters, that a &s;amene&s;s creeps through many pa&s;&s;ages; the ver&s;ification is &s;ufficiently &s;mooth, without an enervating mono|tony,
<PB N="444" REF="450">
and the &s;entiments are elevated without &s;uch an indulgence of fancy as &s;hocks nature; however at the cata&s;trophe we perceive a fault, which is, leaving the audience in doubt concerning the fate of Ore&s;tes; as we have no ground to form an idea of what becomes of him, whether he dies di&s;tract|ed or gets back &s;afe to Greece.</P>
<P>As the author has not &s;crupled to violate real hi&s;tory in the fate of Hermione, he might as well have fixed that of the prince: we are al&s;o of opi|nion that the boy A&s;tyanax might have been intro|duced to con&s;iderable advantage, as a real per&s;oni|fied object mu&s;t ever influence an audience more than an ideal character, witne&s;s the gho&s;t in Ham|let, who makes a much greater impre&s;&s;ion by ap|pearance than the previous de&s;criptions of him, though awful and emphatic can do; we hope it will not appear an Hibernici&s;m to mention a gho&s;t, where per&s;onification is hinted, &s;ince tho&s;e chimeri|cal children of the brain are cloathed with corpo|real &s;emblance.</P>
<P>In point of characters we find that Pyrrhus, who has been a victorious pro&s;elyte of Mars, like many other military heroes, &s;acrifices the dignity of his mind to the charms of Andromache; nay, he gives up common hone&s;ty by a breach of his plighted faith to Hermione; his pa&s;&s;ion is ob&s;tinately fixed, neither danger from abroad nor his own reflection can deter him. In performance he is a good, but not a great part; while in view he commands at|tention and re&s;pect, but he takes leave of the au|dience in an imperfect and uncon&s;equential man|ner; he melts from our view without affording the lea&s;t rea&s;on to think we &s;hall not &s;ee him again.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="451">Dignity of appearance, and placidity of ex|pre&s;&s;ion are e&s;&s;ential to the repre&s;entation of this character; Mr. QUIN po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the former, but rather in a bruti&s;h degree, and the latter he was totally deficient in; he neither looked or &s;poke the lover. Mr. BARRY has done the part with more merit than any other per&s;on we remember, and &s;a|tisfactorily fulfilled every idea we could form of it; he looked like a man that might well engage Hermione's affection, and &s;poke like one who mu&s;t melt the heart of Andromache, had not grief ren|dered it callous to all other feeling. Mr. DIGGES &s;upport<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> it in a manly becoming manner; we know not any per&s;on now at either hou&s;e, who would not be trifling or heavy in it.</P>
<P>The character of Ore&s;tes, as a man, makes a mean figure, though as a lover &s;everely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he engages &s;ome concern; he &s;eems willing to be|tray his tru&s;t as an amba&s;&s;ador, and then turns a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in obedience to his ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion; he has many rapid and violent tran&s;itions, which offer an actor fair opportunities of di&s;playing ca|pital powers to advantage: Mr. RYAN, though very unintere&s;ting through the four fir&s;t acts, threw more fire into the fifth than any of his competitors we remember; his painting of the di&s;traction was truly fine, and the following words in particular he expre&s;&s;ed inimitably:  <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hiver&mdash;oh, I freeze."</Q> Mr. BARRY was uniformly re&s;pectable through the character, but wanted that quick fire of expre&s;&s;ion &s;o requi&s;ite in many pa&s;&s;ages; Mr. MOSSOP is too boi&s;terous in expre&s;&s;ing the pa&s;&s;ions, and toils through the whole piece in a mo&s;t painful manner, incumbered with a &s;tiffne&s;s of deportment incom|patible

with real dignity. Mr. POWELL was languid, totally unequal to the princely Greek; Mr. HOL|LAND had &s;ufficient powers, but mo&s;t rude and in|dige&s;ted; his mechanical formality, and ungovern|able violence, rendered his performance in general, either in&s;ipid or offen&s;ive; Pylades and Phoenix are in point of acting merit below critici&s;m.</P>
<P>Andromache, in our view, appears rather a ro|mantic than a natural character; however the au|thor has made her favourable to the actre&s;s, and very intere&s;ting to the audience. Mrs. CIBBER was undoubtedly her&s;elf alone in the DISTRESSED MOTHER; her feelings were deeply pathetic, and her expre&s;&s;ion entirely adequate; Mrs. BELLAMY di&s;played con&s;iderable merit, but was not equal to her great cotemporary and competitor, though con|&s;iderably beyond any other lady who has come with|in our notice; Mrs. BARRY we have not &s;een, but think &s;he has requi&s;ites and judgment to do An|dromache great ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The Grecian prince&s;s is placed in very odd cir|cum&s;tances, and indeed her conduct &s;eems full as odd as her &s;ituation; love is extremely capricious, and often runs the wi&s;e&s;t heads into actions either very ridiculous or highly culpable. Hermione's violent affection for Pyrrhus may therefore apolo|gize for the incon&s;i&s;tencies which form her cha|racter; but her making &s;uch a fool of poor Ore&s;tes, and her in&s;ulting the di&s;tre&s;s of Andromache, are &s;trong indications of a &s;ubtle, ungenerous, &s;elfi&s;h mind; in action &s;he mu&s;t be very con&s;picuous, giving full &s;cope for the di&s;play of every capital tragic attribute.</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="453">Mrs. WOFFINGTON, in point of voice, was not equal to the pa&s;&s;ions of this part, but filled up every other idea with plea&s;ing and forceable ability. Mrs. FITZHENRY, had &s;he not been a &s;ervile copy of the above-mentioned lady, would have given much &s;a|tisfaction; but ju&s;t and impartial critici&s;m mu&s;t ever frown upon &s;econd-hand acting: if it was di&s;|plea&s;ing in no other view, this alone would render it &s;o, bringing to recollection the merit of an ori|ginal, which mu&s;t ever &s;trike more than the hap|pie&s;t imitation.</P>
<P>Mrs. HAMILTON, an uncertain, excentric actre&s;s, was not without &s;ome excellence in per&s;onating Hermione; Mrs. PRITCHARD, bating figure, did the prince&s;s peculiar ju&s;tice, but upon the whole we are well di&s;po&s;ed to give the capabilities of Mrs. YATES con&s;iderable preference to any who have gone before her.</P>
<P>The Frenchified regularity of this play, which &s;ome very able, but over-nice critics admired at its fir&s;t coming into the world, is in our apprehen&s;ion an enervating circum&s;tance; the characters are too confined, and but indifferently di&s;po&s;ed; Mr. PHILLIPS was happy in being per&s;onally acquaint|ed with tho&s;e eminent geniu&s;&s;es who &s;hed &s;o great a lu&s;tre on QUEEN ANNE's reign; from their par|tial friend&s;hip a much more reputable account was given of this tragedy than it de&s;erves, for beyond all doubt it is heavy in repre&s;entation, and languid in the clo&s;et.</P>

<HEAD>A SHORT DISSERTATION ON Theatrical Management.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the many &s;imilitudes which have been applied to a Theatre, down from a kingdom to a cook's-&s;hop, the former &s;trikes us mo&s;t; we view it as a little but intricate &s;tate, where he who provides &s;hould, like the monarch of a political con&s;titution, &s;eek without any prejudice for or a|gain&s;t individuals, after merit; which, when found, ought to be cheri&s;hed and rewarded: regularity of bu&s;ine&s;s, and propriety of decorations, are mattters of e&s;&s;ential concern; but mechanical &s;tiffne&s;s in the one, which too often appears, and glare in the other, not only offend but mi&s;lead judgment.</P>
<P>A manager as caterer for public ta&s;te, &s;hould &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid adulterating that ta&s;te with &s;pecious trifles, &s;plendid nothingne&s;s; Sadlers Wells would be laughed at &s;hould they attempt tragedies, and Comedies; why then &s;hould Royal Theatres tre&s;pa&s;s on the prerogative of buffoonery? we remember a prologue of Mr. GARRICK's, wherein he was re|markably &s;evere on harlequinades, yet, by &s;ome un|accountable influence, he &s;oon entered warmly into
<PB N="452" REF="458">
an emulative exhibition of tho&s;e exotic unmean|ing whims which he had &s;o ju&s;tly condemned.</P>
<P>How much credit would have beeen reflected on his name had he bani&s;hed &s;uch illegitimate bant|lings of the drama, &s;uch incongruous medleys from the &s;tage; to &s;ay that his own &s;terling merit, &s;up|ported by &s;o excellent a company as he then had, could not have defended the breach of common &s;en&s;e again&s;t the patched coat and wooden &s;word, is paying national ta&s;te a mi&s;erable compliment; in|deed matters are now gone &s;o far that according to the common proverb, we may &s;oon hope to &s;ee them mend, &s;ince it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Is it not equally a&s;toni&s;hing that Mr. COLMAN, who has given &s;ome plea&s;ing proofs of genius, ever &s;ince he has a&s;&s;umed the reins of theatrical go|vernment, &s;hould have laid down the quill (for MAN and WIFE, and the OXONIAN, we e&s;teem as nothing,) to mix with carpenters, projectors, &amp;c. in the fabrication of &s;nip &s;nap changes, Witches, Demons, Mother Shiptons, paltry ballads, face making, tumbling, jumping, and all the wild &amp;c. of pantomimical mummery; poor RICH, as knowing no better, was at lea&s;t pardonable, if not commen|dable, for he gave the public what he loved him|&s;elf; what excu&s;e can be made for tho&s;e who furni&s;h their audience with &s;uch &s;tuff as they mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily and naturally de&s;pi&s;e? there is but one, and that &s;hamefully awkward; that their &s;ole motive is to get money, and if non&s;en&s;e can obtain that gol|den aim with more ea&s;e and advantage than ele|gant in&s;tructive compo&s;itions, vani&s;h genius, what have we to do with thee! no, let dulne&s;s wave her

leaden &s;ceptre, and lay the piercing eyes of critici&s;m fa&s;t a&s;leep, while our pur&s;es &s;well with golden harve&s;t.</P>
<P>But is the genius of writing alone hurt by the&s;e dumb burle&s;ques upon the dignity of human rea|&s;on? no, the genius of acting is &s;till more deeply wounded, as may be plainly evinced; in an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed winter-theatre, it u&s;ed, and ought to be the rule, to have every di&s;tinct ca&s;t of playing &s;upplied by per&s;ons who kept uniformly in that tract; now we find the hero of to-night, often more properly to-morrow night, performing a character of no con|&s;equence, in&s;tance Me&s;&s;rs. HURST, and PALMER, at Drury Lane, and many others at each hou&s;e, who occa&s;ionally mount aloft; this is certainly oeconomical, though not commendable; for the managers hereby get two or three performers for the price of one; and are freed not only from the weighty charge, but al&s;o the painful con&s;equence of men really meritorious.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if one, two, or three, of the &s;top-gaps either retire of them&s;elves or are taken off by death, their places are ea&s;ily filled by &s;ome of the thirty &s;hillings a week tribe, who &s;natch greedily at an additional guinea to become capital, and bind them&s;elves three or four years for a penurious pit|tance.</P>
<P>There is another re&s;ource for recruiting, which, though private emolument may have occurred, has the&s;e three or four years pa&s;t afforded very lit|tle public entertainment; I mean collecting from itinerant companies people who have a&s;toni&s;hed villages and market towns for years; of whom there is not the lea&s;t hope of improvement; and
<PB N="454" REF="460">
&s;hoving them on under the artful &s;helter of a fir&s;t appearance; each of the&s;e adventurers is engaged at &s;uch a rate, that the attraction of a fir&s;t night, generally pays his, or her whole &s;alary for the &s;ea|&s;on, if critici&s;m withers all hope the fir&s;t attempt, there is no lo&s;s but to the unhappy individual, who meets condemnation; if they exi&s;t three, four, or half a dozen nights, which <HI>orders,</HI> and <HI>paragraphs</HI> may ea&s;ily effect, the managers are &s;ure to gain; and then the neglected objects may &s;ink as fa&s;t as they can, to make way for others equally in&s;ipid, but le&s;s known, and therefore more attractive.</P>
<P>That this game has been mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly played of late, and with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s, is evi|dent to the &s;hame of London audiences, who, by a&s;&s;erting their own judgement and dignity, &s;hould prevent the practice of kidnapping performers who might live decently in the country, to render them de&s;picable and obnoxious in the capital.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance of power which we ap|prehend contributes to render the &s;ituation of our patentees rather unea&s;y to them&s;elves, as well as prejudicial to genius; we mean the reception or rejection of new pieces; we lay it down as a po&s;i|tive rule that, in duty to the public, each hou&s;e, if furni&s;hed with &s;o many &s;hould produce &s;ix new plays, and as many after pieces every winter; if &s;o many are not furni&s;hed and approved, they cannot be expected from the managers; but if they <HI>are</HI> pro|duced, no Mother Shiptons, no Jubilees&mdash;mere cu&s;|ards of folly, &s;hould be &s;erved up &s;uch a multitude of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive nights; &s;uch an opening would give every dramatic writer a fair chance; and that intrin&s;ic merit alone &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf without the in&s;tructive,
<PB N="455" REF="461">
dogmatical recommendations of titled blockheads, which is at pre&s;ent almo&s;t the only path to admi&s;&s;ion; that men of liberal education might not be taxed with the mortifying nece&s;&s;ity, of tedious and &s;ervile atten|dance, let a DRAMATIC SOCIETY, or INQUEST, for the examination of every new piece, that may be &s;ent for their in&s;pection, be e&s;tabli&s;hed; let the au|thors be under the &s;tricte&s;t obligation not to di&s;clo&s;e them&s;elves till the fate of their productions take place, let that be determined by a majority of votes, and let the &s;eal of the inque&s;t be an undeniable re|commendation to the managers, whom we would &s;o far indulge as to be con&s;tant members of the &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>Upon this plan we are confident more plays, and with much more credit, would annually appear; genius would then apply it&s;elf in a becoming man|ner, and &s;eldom fail of due reward.</P>
<P>That we may not &s;eem too hard upon managers, we cannot avoid ob&s;erving that the third and &s;ixth night, with the advantage of Printing, mu&s;t be a very adequate reward for any play, &s;uppo&s;ing it to co&s;t the author twelve months application; and if any production of that kind takes more than half the time, we are ready to believe it will prove labo|rious, and unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>As to dre&s;&s;es and &s;cenery, tho&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible pa|raphernalia, they have been extremely well attended to, and elegantly &s;upplied for the la&s;t &s;even years, in &s;o much that we may truly &s;ay the &s;tage has propor|tionally improved in decorations, as it has declined in acting merit; it is now for the mo&s;t part &s;plen|didly in&s;ipid; we have the robes and proce&s;&s;ions of tragedy, but want her &s;pirit; how ju&s;t an applica|tion

<HEAD>A SUMMARY VIEW OF THE Mo&s;t Known DRAMATIC WRITERS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING offered &s;ome hints to abate that rancorous prejudice which attacks the character of a player; that illiberal cen&s;ure which &s;tigmatizes the profe&s;&s;ion, as not only obnoxious to moral rectitude, but contemptible in &s;ociety; it becomes a duty to offer our readers &s;ome remarks upon theatrical authors, with this re&s;erve, that our cri|tici&s;ms upon them mu&s;t rather be general than particular.</P>
<P>Mr. POPE has &s;tiled an hone&s;t man the noble&s;t work of God. This is perhaps an exaggerated compliment to the human &s;pecies, e&s;pecially if, as the Chri&s;tian faith directs, we allow the exi&s;tence of beings much more refined, much nearer the purity of ab&s;olute perfection, than we in a &s;tate of frail mortality can come; in the &s;ame light we con|&s;ider Mr. ADDISON's a&s;&s;ertion, that a good tragedy
<PB N="458" REF="464">
is the noble&s;t work of man. However thus much advantage we may derive from his opinion, that a play founded on virtuous principles is a valuable acqui&s;ition, and that the author of it may be deem|ed an ornament as well as a friend to his coun|try.</P>
<P>The moral rectitude of Mr. ADDISON never has been called in que&s;tion, his writings are all cha&s;te and in&s;tructive; his circum&s;tances were indepen|dant of emoluments as an author, therefore we may very ju&s;tly infer, that his approbation of the &s;tage proceeded from cool, di&s;intere&s;ted, impartial, conviction; that it was worthy countenance, not merely as an amu&s;ement, but as a &s;chool of im|provement; that it has been pro&s;tituted to very un|worthy views by &s;ome men of great abilities, mu&s;t be acknowledged, &s;o has the pulpit by &s;ordid &s;cep|tics, and wild enthu&s;ia&s;ts; &s;o have the courts of ju&s;tice by venal judges, and corrupt practitioners; in &s;hort plays and players may reduce their plea of reputation to one &s;ingle obvious point, where rea&s;on readily and powerfully &s;upports their cau&s;e; if in common, with every circum&s;tance and &s;tation of life they manife&s;t an alloy, &s;ure they cannot merit general condemnation for not being totally free from blame.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that not one of the hot-mouthed preachers, or bedlamite authors who have declaimed and wrote again&s;t the &s;tage, ever offered more than a diffu&s;e, un&s;upported, malevolent charge, that the in&s;titution is diabolical; if they are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of any arguments to make good this gloomy a&s;&s;ertion, they take care never to let them &s;lip into
<PB N="459" REF="465">
public view, lea&s;t inve&s;tigation &s;hould prove them to be the froth of fermented malice.</P>
<P>It is in vain to contend any point with wretches whom avaricious views, or ob&s;tinate ignorance, for|tify again&s;t all approaches of rea&s;on; animals in the human &s;hape, who cover wolfi&s;h hearts with the inoffen&s;ive &s;emblance of &s;heep, who endeavour to render the paternal di&s;pen&s;ations of providence in|effectual; who change the comfortable &s;miles of religion into the mo&s;t mortifying frowns; who pre|tend that mi&s;ery here is the &s;afe&s;t road to happine&s;s hereafter; who would break the &s;pirit, and re&s;train the faculties of man, under pretence of rectify|ing his mind; who would upon the whole prevent or &s;uppre&s;s the mo&s;t laudable, and e&s;&s;ential ordina|tions of &s;ociety, to make the great and multitudi|nous &s;tage of nature, one deplorable, unvarying &s;cene of &s;lumbering in&s;ipidity, frenzied di&s;content, or tragic exhibition.</P>
<P>The mimic &s;tage derives from &s;uch foes much more credit than prejudice; wherefore to their own dulne&s;s, hypocri&s;y, or avarice, we leave them, not forgetting in Chri&s;tian charity, to wi&s;h every pitiable or dete&s;table character, a &s;peedy and entire refor|mation.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEARE, who has by general con&s;ent, been &s;tiled father of the Engli&s;h drama, fir&s;t pre&s;ents him&s;elf; his characteri&s;tics intragedy are &s;upporting and pur&s;uing all the pa&s;&s;ions which agitate, adorn, or di&s;grace human nature to their utmo&s;t extent; a &s;trict and mo&s;t prai&s;e worthy adherence to unifor|mity of character, both in conduct and language; he never &s;inks an elevated per&s;onage in dialogue, nor rai&s;es a low one by improper dignity of phra&s;e;
<PB N="460" REF="466">
variety and &s;trong contra&s;ts &s;eem always in his view, he well knew the force of his own genius and &s;ought &s;ubjects &s;uitable; his choice of hi&s;torical plots was highly judicious, as a more exten&s;ive field than any other, a field in which &s;carce any other author has ranged, with &s;ucce&s;s, except BANKES, who&s;e well cho&s;en &s;ubjects made the wor&s;t writing that ever e&s;caped poetical pen bearable.</P>
<P>Though we &s;hould have been &s;orry to perceive the trammels of critici&s;m, on SHAKESPEARE's fire-eyed Pega&s;us, yet we rather wi&s;h that he had not &s;hown &s;o total a contempt for probable regularity; he certainly might have ob&s;erved &s;ome bounds, without any prejudice to his imagination, and we particularly lament tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;ting &s;craps of fa&s;hio|nable buffoonery which occur in, and di&s;grace, ma|ny of his be&s;t pieces: in comedy we find him fan|ciful and plea&s;ant, his characters are rich and plea&s;ing, though ob&s;olete; his plots in general good, though irregular, mo&s;t of his cata&s;trophes &s;atisfactory; his conver&s;ation nervous and pointed, but in &s;ome places rather &s;tiff; faults frequently occur, but they are hid amid&s;t a blaze of beauties; and it may be truly &s;aid of this author, that criti|ci&s;m reluctantly &s;tumbles upon his blemi&s;hes, hav|ing &s;o rich a fund for prai&s;e and admiration.</P>
<P>DRYDEN, as a tragic writer, encouraged bomba&s;t ideas and pompo&s;ity of ver&s;ification, aiming more at the marvellous than ju&s;t pictures of nature; how|ever his ALL for LOVE has merit, and there are &s;ome ma&s;terly &s;trokes in the character of DORAX, in DON SEBASTION; in tho&s;e &s;cenes of OEDIPUS, &s;aid to be written by him, we di&s;cover great merit, and may ju&s;tly conclude, that his plays in rhime
<PB N="461" REF="467">
were the effect of a &s;ervile compliance with fal&s;e ta&s;te, occa&s;ioned by very unfavourable circum|&s;tances, which perverted his genius, and en&s;laved his opinion; indeed his principles appeared, upon every occa&s;ion, &s;ub&s;ervient to pecuniary advan|tage.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding there are &s;ome well imagined whim&s;ical characters in his comic writings, the de|te&s;table licentiou&s;ne&s;s with which they are loaded, renders them obnoxious, and we could wi&s;h them &s;unk in oblivion; a di&s;&s;olute court will ever taint public entertainments, as well as private conduct; and it &s;eems DRYDEN's peculiar misfortune to have written in a reign when vice was patronized by the highe&s;t authority; a reign which wanted the hone&s;t indignation and keen &s;atire of a JUVENAL to cha&s;tize and expo&s;e its infamy.</P>
<P>BEN JOHNSON, though ranked &s;o high in literary fame, does not appear to us de&s;erving of &s;o honou|rable a &s;tation; his tragedies are the mo&s;t &s;tiff, un|couth, laborious, unaffecting, productions we know, &s;pun out to an intolerable length, by tedious, un|e&s;&s;ential, declamatory pa&s;&s;ages, tran&s;lated from the cla&s;&s;ics; three of his comedies have ju&s;tly received the &s;tamp of general approbation; VOLPONE, SI|LENT WOMAN, and EVERY MAN in his HUMOUR; yet even in the&s;e nature &s;eems rather carricatur'd, and there are many blamable intru&s;ions upon de|licacy of idea and expre&s;&s;ion; the remainder of his works might have dubbed any man, le&s;s lucky, with the title of a bad writer, and we are perfectly of opinion that naming him with his great cotem|porary, is pairing authors as poulterers do rabbits, a fat and a lean one.</P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="468">OTWAY was peculiarly happy in a full and un|rivalled po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the true Pathos; in his two plays of VENICE PRESERVED and the ORPHAN, the audience are never left to a &s;tate of indifference, but tied down by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of intere&s;ting &s;trokes to a mo&s;t feeling, &s;ympathetic attention; his ver&s;i|fication is the mo&s;t unaffected and natural for dia|logue of any we know; but the whole of his re|putation &s;hould re&s;t upon the two pieces we have mentioned; his other productions, of the &s;erious ca&s;t, are very meagre, and his comedies not only poor, but infamous; it &s;eems to have been a &s;ettled maxim with OTWAY, to &s;how the mo&s;t unfavoura|ble pictures of human life, yet, by a kind of be|witching power, he annexes pity to the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;uch characters as &s;hould rather fall under con|tempt.</P>
<P>ROWE de&s;erves the prai&s;e of being cha&s;te, moral, and pathetic; he has evidently in&s;truction con&s;tant|ly in view; his merit, &s;ave one unfortunate at|tempt upon comedy, is more uniform than that of any other writer; it is true he does not ri&s;e within many degrees of SHAKESPEARE's peculiar eleva|tion, but at the &s;ame time, he never &s;inks &s;o low, and it is not an exaggerated compliment to &s;ay of him, as LORD LITTLETON has done of THOMPSON, that he never wrote a line which, dying, he might wi&s;h to blot; his FAIR PENITENT and JANE SHORE, keep the &s;tage mo&s;t con&s;tantly, though we think his TAMERLANE rather &s;uperior, and his AMBITI|OUS STEP MOTHER equal to either; one, and only one, fault we find with this amiable author, which is, making all his characters &s;peak in exactly the &s;ame &s;tile, furni&s;hing them with too rich, too fanciful a
<PB N="463" REF="469">
&s;train of expre&s;&s;ion, and frequently making the poet take place of the character.</P>
<P>LEE po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great fire of imagination and much tenderne&s;s; but we need no other information than peru&s;al of his pieces to know that his brain was frenzied; THEODOSIUS notwith&s;tanding many &s;trange extravagancies, is &s;ufficient to fix his claim to poetical merit.</P>
<P>The mu&s;es be&s;towed &s;miles of peculiar favour on Mr. ADDISON, but his poem of CATO hardly gives him title to the &s;tile of a dramatic author; if he was really writer of that plea&s;ing, natural, &s;imple, comedy, the DRUMMER, we readily admit him, and wi&s;h he had favoured the world with more produc|tions of a &s;imilar kind.</P>
<P>THOMPSON &s;eems to have been much better cal|culated for ea&s;y poetry than theatrical compo&s;ition; yet his plays &s;trongly manife&s;t a knowledge of na|ture, a moral delicacy of judgment, and great &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion; but they are wanting in point of bu&s;ine&s;s, incidents are too thinly &s;cattered, and his &s;cenes frequently fall from their length, he does not appear to have known, or con&s;idered, the effect of repre&s;entation, and critici&s;m may ea&s;ily di&s;cover that he wrote more for the clo&s;et than the &s;tage.</P>
<P>From all we can collect of this re&s;pectable au|thor, we may conclude that he was &s;o tenacious of a virtuous tendency, he never could have been pre|vailed upon to flatter depraved ta&s;te, as DRYDEN did.</P>
<P>We recollect a circum&s;tance in his life, which, though foreign to our plan, mu&s;t be plea&s;ing to eve|ry generous mind; a very &s;trict cordial intimacy
<PB N="464" REF="470">
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted between THOMPSON and QUIN, the former, who was often in low circum&s;tances, invited his friend to dine with him at Kew, where he then lived; after the ho&s;pitable repa&s;t was over, the author, who was as remarkable for mode&s;ty as genius, with much he&s;itation told the player he wanted fifty pounds, and would e&s;teem the loan of that &s;um as a great favour. QUIN, with his u&s;ual roughne&s;s, replied, look ye JEMMY THOMPSON, this is an odd invitation of yours; you have given me a good dinner, and I have done it ju&s;tice, but did not think I was to pay &s;o confounded dear for it; this brutal rebuff &s;ilenced the diffident bard, and not a &s;yllable more was then mentioned of the matter.</P>
<P>Next morning THOMPSON received a letter from his churli&s;h friend to this effect, JEMMY QUIN in|forms JEMMY THOMPSON that he hates the word <HI>lend,</HI> but if the inclo&s;ed bit of paper is of any u&s;e, &s;hall be happy: here a bank note for two hundred pounds unfolded it&s;elf, and in a po&s;t&s;cript were the&s;e words; my wine merchant will this day &s;end you a hog&s;head of his be&s;t claret, which I will come and help you to demoli&s;h, as often as health, lei&s;ure, and inclination, will permit; there was a con&s;ide|rable &s;hare of oddity in this action, but it is bet|ter to do good, even ungraciou&s;ly, than to neglect drooping, oppre&s;&s;ed, merit; and it is no &s;mall ad|dition to Mr. QUIN's character, that he afterwards reproved his friend &s;harply for making the matter known.</P>
<P>DOUGLASS HOME, we title this author from his fir&s;t piece, becau&s;e not one he has written &s;ince po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es any tolerable degree of dramatic merit; he enjoys &s;ome &s;hare of genius; his de&s;criptions are

in general picture&s;que, and &s;ometimes pathetic; but upon the whole, he traces the more powerful pa&s;&s;ions languidly; his characters want variety, his plots are barren, and his cata&s;trophes very imper|fect; his language is &s;ufficiently cha&s;te and flowing, but wants vigour, and many &s;cenes drag through a dull unintere&s;ting &s;amene&s;s; church per&s;ecution has made many nations bleed in every age; however the au&s;tere pre&s;bytery of Scotland forced this gen|tleman's pen and circum&s;tances into a &s;ituation which they could never have reached without &s;uch illiberal oppre&s;&s;ion; it may be truly &s;aid this bard, like par&s;ley, has vegetated the better for being trod upon, and though we cannot admit, yet we cordi|ally congratulate him on his peculiar &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

<P>MOORE, author of the Fables for the fair &s;ex, has left us one tragedy, which, being written in an unu&s;ual &s;tile, and upon a very unfa&s;hionable &s;ub|ject, does not pre&s;erve the &s;tation it has a right to claim; for we are bold to pronounce it a mo&s;t &s;triking and in&s;tructive picture of nature, e&s;pecial|ly as &s;he is depraved in Great Britain at pre&s;ent, though perhaps he has tinctured his piece towards

the latter end with too high a colouring of hor|ror.</P>
<P>The GAMESTER certainly attacks one of the mo&s;t pernicious national vices that can prevail, and the familiar pro&s;e dialogue renders it more intelligible to all degrees of an audience: Some critics &s;eemed to think it lo&s;t con&s;equence and politene&s;s for want of being expre&s;&s;ed in mea&s;ured &s;yllables. Indeed it is no wonder that the boxes in general &s;hould be afraid to view the horrid con&s;equences of tran&s;ac|tions they them&s;elves are &s;o devoted to, and &s;o deep|ly involved in; however, we give the author great prai&s;e for all and every part of this play; in the comic &s;tile he was delicate and &s;pirited; his aim in writing &s;eemed to center in the production of &s;ome|thing u&s;eful, therefore his deficiencies, which were but &s;light, &s;hould not be mentioned.</P>
<P>MURPHY, by picking up materials from the French and &s;ome of our own writers, has manu|factured &s;everal prai&s;eworthy pieces in both the &s;e|rious and gay; the latter &s;eems mo&s;t his talent, but he has &s;o excellent a knack of pilfering, that no author ever &s;eemed to maintain a greater equality in the contra&s;t &s;tiles; without one grain of origi|nality he has pieced together &s;everal plays that mu&s;t plea&s;e, by a very exten&s;ive knowledge of theatrical action, and its effects; he has compo&s;ed tragedy without poetry, unle&s;s &s;trained and multiplied me|taphors de&s;erve the name, and comedy without wit; he ranks well among&s;t living authors, but let the dead call out for their own, and like the bird with borrowed feathers you would &s;oon perceive him in a &s;tate of poetical nakedne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="473">HOOLE, a &s;ucce&s;sful tran&s;lator, who has to his own con&s;iderable emolument plundered Meta&s;ta&s;io of two flim&s;y mor&s;els, which are well enough cal|culated to &s;lip down and reli&s;h with palled appe|tites, but have nothing in them truly &s;ub&s;tantial for vigorous critical dige&s;tion; they &s;eem made for the actors who are too weak to bear up a heavier ta&s;k, and the actors appear calculated for them, which greater abilities could make nothing of; &s;o far a happy junction: But what mu&s;t ta&s;te, and tho&s;e fine feelings we have had gratified, exclaim when they are forced to be patient with &s;uch acting, and &s;uch compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>We now come to authors who have chiefly pro|fe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves votaries of the comic mu&s;e, and fir&s;t mention CONGREVE, not only in point of time, but, as we think, of merit; no man who ever wrote for the &s;tage has &s;hewn more capital, more correct, or more plea&s;ing delineations of life; his characters are beautifully contra&s;ted, his language pointed, his wit brilliant, his plots amazingly regular and plea&s;ingly intricate, his &s;cenes variegated, and his di&s;po&s;ition of the whole ma&s;terly, two faults, one of a very heavy nature, countervail his exten&s;ive merit, his fla&s;hes of wit are too frequent, often too much for the per&s;on who utters them, his dia|logue rather profu&s;e, and a mo&s;t abominable vein of licentiou&s;ne&s;s runs through the whole; virtue reluctantly peeps in, while vice with brazen front bolts forward unblu&s;hing, unre&s;trained: Had this author written under the commendable re&s;trictions of this age, his luxuriou&s;ne&s;s would have been brought within better bounds. His pieces mu&s;t give great plea&s;ure either in action or peru&s;al, but
<PB N="468" REF="474">
are like the &s;weet &s;cented ro&s;e, with prickles beneath, which while it gratifies one &s;en&s;e wounds another; it is with reluctance we pronounce the &s;entence of moral ju&s;tice which condemns his four comedies to ob|livion, as pernicious; but we doom his tragedy to con|tempt, with the full &s;atisfaction of critical propriety.</P>
<P>FARQUHAR is not &s;o rich, but more natural than CONGREVE, his plots are not &s;o laboured and cor|rect, yet are full as agreeable; his characters are all well &s;elected from the volume of life, plea&s;ing|ly grouped, and well di&s;po&s;ed of at the cata&s;trophes; &s;ome &s;cenes are rather improbable, as Tom Errand's getting into Lady Lurewell's chamber and &s;trip|ping before her; be&s;ides &s;ome others which we could point out; however they are introduced with a de|gree of whim, which renders them excu&s;able; no doubt the STRATAGEM and RECRUTING OFFICER are far before any other production of his, yet the remainder are not without very great unforced plea&s;antry.</P>
<P>CIBBER, the laurelled CIBBER, though he had no claim even to the &s;malle&s;t &s;prig of a poetical tree, has neverthele&s;s by way of attonement, for his doleful birth day odes, furni&s;hed the &s;tage with &s;ome agreeable pieces; there is a vivacity and pert|ne&s;s di&s;coverable peculiar to him&s;elf; his comedies are not very original, yet are they in general very laughable; they had the e&s;&s;ential &s;upport of mo&s;t capital acting at their fir&s;t appearance; el&s;e we think they might have &s;unk into the Lethean &s;tream; the much boa&s;ted CaARELESS HUSBAND is, no doubt, remarkable for elegance of dialogue and character; yet it is a very drow&s;y exhibition.</P>

<P>VANBRUGH, as an artichect, was accu&s;ed of hav|ing a very phlegmatic ta&s;te; in writing he appears to po&s;&s;e&s;s exactly the contra&s;t; &s;pirit, propriety, and character; he &s;eems to have known life well, and has in his dramatic compo&s;itions made good u&s;e of that knowledge; his language is free, his &s;cenes well di&s;po&s;ed, incidents plea&s;ant, and plots regular; his play of the PROVOKED WIFE, notwith|&s;tanding a &s;trong vein of humour, is &s;candalou&s;ly licentious, even as it is now performed; how much more &s;o when he adopted the character of a cler|gyman for rioting, beating the watch, &amp;c. we are &s;urprized, however great Mr. GARRICK may be in Sir John Brute, that he contributes to keep alive &s;o cen&s;urable a piece; its merits are, or ought to be, totally &s;unk into its infamy.</P>

<P>Mrs. CENTLIVRE had a pretty, whim&s;ical talent of compo&s;ition, and &s;ome originality; but her pro|ductions are more of froth than &s;olidity; they may divert but cannot improve, and often, for want of decency, &s;hame a female pen.</P>
<P>SOUTHERNE, as a tragic writer, made very power|ful attacks upon the tender pa&s;&s;ions, and is remar|kably free in his ver&s;ification; his comedy is not without &s;pirit, humour, and character; but the in|fectious ta&s;te of Charles's reign, rendered it gro&s;s enough for the entertainment of a brothel.</P>

<P>GARRICK has employed his pen rather exten&s;ive|ly, and if he had let alone at lea&s;t two thirds of his Prologues we &s;hould gladly have allowed him a better place as an author than we can do; he has introduced &s;o much of the ludicrous, and played

&s;o repeatedly on the &s;ame ideas, that critici&s;m, though it may be forced to laugh, mu&s;t be much offended. In one he &s;tiles him&s;elf a Prologue|&s;mith, we wi&s;h he had wrought up more &s;teel, and rejected much of the dro&s;s he has forged into rhime; when the advantages of &s;peaking are with|drawn, we fear they will not be deemed any addi|tion to the writer's name.

<P>Thus much our impartiality obliges us to &s;ay at the &s;ame time, we mo&s;t gladly allow this gentle|man warm prai&s;e for his alterations, and judicious amendments of &s;everal plays, be&s;ides the production of &s;ome very plea&s;ing originals; his perfect know|ledge of the &s;tage makes him ma&s;ter of di&s;po&s;ition; he has &s;pirit and correctne&s;s, but &s;eems, in our idea, much better &s;upplied with ta&s;te than genius, with humour than wit: we &s;ee him prefixed, in a kind of poetical partner&s;hip, to the CLANDESTINE MAR|RIAGE; we know not what part he had in that co|medy, but readily admit that the compo&s;ition does him and Mr. COLMAN great credit.</P>
<P>FOOTE, this writer we &s;tile the dramatic noun &s;ub&s;tantive, who &s;tands entirely upon his own bot|tom; who&s;e peculiarity of genius, &s;trength of judgment, knowledge of life, &s;election of charac|ters, application of &s;atire, vivacity of &s;entiment, and ter&s;ene&s;s of dialogue, place him di&s;tinct from any other writer, pa&s;t and pre&s;ent. There is one point worth ob&s;erving, which is, that though he often ap|pears negligent in working up his cata&s;trophe, yet he &s;tudiou&s;ly, and in the mo&s;t agreeable manner, impre&s;&s;es moral inferences upon &s;uch of his audi|ence

as chu&s;e to think; and tho&s;e who only come to laugh, receive no taint from vitiated ideas. The charge of per&s;onal &s;everity that has been le|velled again&s;t him, mu&s;t, upon a moment's con&s;i|deration, fall to the ground; for if there are &s;uch knaves, fools, hypocrites, and coxcombs, as he pre|&s;ents to public view, there is no doubt but &s;uch are fit objects of &s;atire, and ought to feel her keene&s;t la&s;h.</P>
<P>COLMAN, as we called the la&s;t mentioned author a noun &s;ub&s;tantive, we are induced to &s;tile this gen|tleman a noun adjective; for by his productions, ever &s;ince he has &s;eparated from Mr. GARRICK, we receive melancholy proofs that he cannot &s;tand a|lone. His JEALOUS WIFE, no doubt, gives him claim to a very honourable &s;tation in the dramatic li&s;t, but we have great rea&s;on to apprehend he had &s;ome powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance in compo&s;ing that play; however, we imagine, that &s;en&s;ible of his own in|tellectual decay, or natural weakne&s;s, he has &s;hrewdly appealed to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pantomime, and turned his pen into a wooden &s;word, for the patch coat conjuror. Mercy deliver us! what a tran&s;i|tion for even common &s;en&s;e to make, unle&s;s urged by the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity? how would JOHNNY RICH exult, take &s;nuff, and &s;troke his cats, were he alive again, to &s;ee an author &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of &s;peechle&s;s mummery, before which he had &s;o many years pro&s;trated his empty noddle? how would he rejoice to &s;ee the Nine Mu&s;es &s;wallowed up by MOTHER SHIPTON, as greedily as the Dragon of Wantly devoured hou&s;es and churches? would the voracious old lady had been buried in a real York&s;hire coal-pit, never to have appeared again,

As a dramati&s;t, this gentle|man is as much upon the medium as any writer we know; his tragic &s;trains will never make any body cry, nor will his comic ones ever rai&s;e a laugh; however, though he cannot reach ab&s;olute prai&s;e, he e&s;capes po&s;itive blame. His &s;entiments are ju&s;t and commendable, his dialogne poli&s;hed, but a dreadful &s;oporific languor drow&s;es over the whole, throwing both auditors and readers into a poppean lethargy. His la&s;t Trip, that to Scotland we mean, was un|luckily imagined; there could not be a wor&s;e clime for the production of humour.

<HEAD>THEATRICAL REPRESENTATION AND PERFORMERS.</HEAD>
<P>TO give a ju&s;t delineation of nature for the &s;tage, either in compo&s;ition or action, claims very peculiar and powerful talents; wherefore it is more a matter of &s;urprize, that &s;o many &s;hould arrive at decency in both, than that &s;o few &s;hould attain ex|cellence in either. Of the former, we have already &s;poken as far as our plan &s;eemed to admit; of the latter, we &s;hall now deliver our &s;entiments on the &s;ame principle, with unchecked freedom, and we hope with &s;ome propriety.</P>
<P>Mimic repre&s;entation of the incidents and cha|racters which fill up this great &s;tage of life would be almo&s;t an un&s;urmountable difficulty, if every &s;pectator was a competent judge of the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es; but critici&s;m being for the mo&s;t part con|fined to one &s;phere, by individuals, though feelings are pretty general, fal&s;e colouring and di&s;proportion often go down. We remember the circum&s;tance, &s;everal years &s;ince, of an intelligent countryman, who was carried to &s;ee the STRATAGEM, in which our
<PB N="476" REF="482">
Engli&s;h Ro&s;cius was &s;o do Archer. The per&s;ons who accompanied this natural critic, had previou&s;ly given this great actor his due prai&s;e; however, they left the ru&s;tic to find him out. His &s;en&s;ations be|ing properly operated upon, he di&s;covered, that brother Martin was a woundy comical blade, and gave him, as well as Scrub, a hearty tribute of laughter; but being told it was Garrick, he would not give credit, becau&s;e, &s;aid he, a <HI>great</HI> man would never wear a livery; however, in the la&s;t act, where Archer was dre&s;&s;ed like a gay and blooming bride|groom, he readily admitted the truth. From this and a multitude of in&s;tances which might be ad|vanced, it is demon&s;trable, that though nature has &s;trings of &s;ympathetic uni&s;on, when judiciou&s;ly touched, yet her feelings are often checked or per|verted by external prejudices, wherein the eye &s;u|percedes the heart.</P>
<P>It is an odd remark, but it may be fully ju&s;tified, that the blind in general are much better judges of tones than tho&s;e who &s;ee; that the dumb and deaf are the able&s;t judges of action, and the rea&s;on ob|viou&s;ly is, their being confined to the perception of a &s;ingle &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Theatrical repre&s;entation &s;hould undoubtedly be con&s;idered and conducted as the water colour paint|ing of life; for, as oil &s;cenes, though fini&s;hed by the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed ma&s;ters, would melt away to an undi&s;tingui&s;hable glare of &s;amene&s;s by the rays of an artificial light, &s;o, in the &s;ame &s;ituation, animated characters mu&s;t be &s;u&s;tained with more forceable &s;trokes than we meet in real life; but then tho&s;e &s;trokes &s;hould be tempered &s;o to the di&s;tance, that

to an audience they may &s;eem no &s;tronger nor fainter.</P>
<P>The natural mode of exhibiting tragedy, and in|deed comedy al&s;o, no doubt, owes its ri&s;e to Mr. Garrick; for, before him, it is agreed on all hands, that not only blank ver&s;e was &s;welled to a mo&s;t di&s;|gu&s;tful monotonous pompo&s;ity, but even common pro&s;e dialogue was ver&s;ified by utterance. It may &s;eem &s;trange, but we aver it to be true, that Mr. Delane, who had many fine requi&s;ites for a great actor, u&s;ed to tell Boniface
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have heard your town of Litchfield much commended for its ale,"</Q>
in as con&s;equential a manner, and as regular a ca|dence, as he u&s;ed in Pyrrhus, when replying to the emba&s;&s;y of Ore&s;tes.</P>
<P>We have one capital living in&s;tance of what is called the old way, we mean Mr. Wignell, of Covent Garden, who is, to borrow from the title of Tom Thumb, the mo&s;t tragical tragedian that ever tra|gedized on any &s;tage. We heartily wi&s;h, to &s;hew what nature in repre&s;entation is, and what &s;he is not, and al&s;o to prove that the general approbation of Mr. Garrick's mode is not founded upon fa&s;hiona|ble acquie&s;cence, that the afore&s;aid gentlemen were to play Jaffier and Pierre, or Dumont and Ha&s;tings, in contra&s;t, then would ari&s;e a conviction in favour of propriety, which mu&s;t impre&s;s the mo&s;t ru&s;ticated ob&s;ervation; however. Mr. Wignell may certainly claim nature at &s;econd hand, &s;ince cu&s;tom has &s;o far wrought upon him, that he is the &s;ame off as on the &s;tage; and always, in either ca&s;e, appears no other than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In &s;tage oratory there is amazing variation, and great part of this depends upon the performer's

happy conception. We cannot enter minutely in|to a &s;ubject, which, properly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, would fill a volume; therefore, only &s;ome general outlines can be offered. All unimpa&s;&s;ioned declamation &s;hould be delivered in a full, di&s;tinct, level, tone of voice, &s;o modulated as ju&s;tly to mark the cadences, ac|cording to the &s;tops: all exclamations, whether of grief or rapture, violence of rage, or climaxes of &s;urpri&s;e, &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed by upper notes; and all pa&s;&s;ages of gloomy rage, de&s;pair, revenge, &amp;c. by the lower. In point of empha&s;is there is a ta&s;te as well as propriety; the former of which ari&s;es on|ly from a thorough knowledge of the author, and a refined ear; the latter, by it&s;elf, will ever appear &s;tiff and mechanical. There may be in&s;tances where &s;uperior judgment may a&s;&s;i&s;t inferior, re|&s;pecting a difficult pa&s;&s;age; but marking every em|pha&s;is in a performer's part, as we have heard of the late Mrs. Ward, and &s;ome others, is en&s;laving ideas wretchedly, reducing the performer to almo&s;t the &s;tate of wood and wire; leading-&s;tring actors and actre&s;&s;es may be pa&s;&s;able, but can never be great. There is one remarkable peculiarity which we are inclined to cen&s;ure highly, yet modi&s;hly a|dopted on the &s;tage at pre&s;ent, particularly at Co|vent Garden: a kind of une&s;&s;ential empha&s;is hunting, that lays powerful &s;tre&s;s upon words which by no means require it, lifting up the conclu&s;ive word of a period, which mo&s;t erroneou&s;ly gives force, not only to per&s;ons but particles, almo&s;t wherever they are met <HI>by, my, the, you, thou, thy,</HI> &amp;c. we wi&s;h this was &s;o reformed as to ob&s;erve where antithe&s;is, which chiefly governs the empha&s;is of the&s;e and &s;uch

<P>Breaks and pau&s;es, &s;uch as occur in HAMLET, LEAR, MACBETH, and other plays of Shake&s;peare, are very difficult to execute happily.

<P>Stage deportment &s;hould be free, and void of all affectation; &s;olemnity of &s;tep, by breaking half way, the old mode, or dragging the hind foot with a kind of &s;lide, are both unmeaning and ungrace|ful; &s;tooping, unle&s;s where nece&s;&s;ary, maims a fi|gure much, and di&s;plea&s;es the ob&s;erving eye; turning too often from the per&s;on &s;poken to, for &s;ake of di&s;playing figure, by traver&s;ing the &s;tage, is a breach of decorum, not only incon&s;i&s;tent with civility but rea&s;on; and looking from the object of conver&s;ation, to take a view of the audience, or, as we have too often &s;een, to &s;alute an acquaintance, is reprehen&s;ible to the la&s;t degree, di&s;re&s;pectful both to the actor on the &s;tage, and to the public; &s;peak|ing or not, a performer &s;hould never lo&s;e &s;ight of character, yet many we have viewed waking as it were from a reverie ju&s;t when alarmed by their cue.</P>
<P>As action is the life of public &s;peaking, we think it &s;hould be mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly cultivated, and that rather by a &s;tudious, rational, enquiry into motions of ea&s;e, grace, and explanation, than the reflection of a looking-gla&s;s. Shake&s;peare's general rule, let the action &s;uit the words, the words the action, is conci&s;e, comprehen&s;ive, and ju&s;t; as is al&s;o his in|terdiction again&s;t &s;awing the air. We think that a
<PB N="480" REF="486">
&s;et of drawing, to &s;hew all the variations of action in the different &s;ituations of character, would be highly u&s;eful, not only a rich &s;ubject for de&s;cribing all the pa&s;&s;ions of the features, but all the po&s;iti|ons of the body; we wi&s;h Mr. Garrick to be the &s;ubject of &s;uch a de&s;ign, for &s;uch &s;ized prints as would come at a price &s;uitable to general purcha&s;e; but it is a matter of too great fatigue to be ever hoped for; however tho&s;e capital pieces, in which we have &s;een his excellence de&s;cribed, ju&s;tify our wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Attitudes, we mean tho&s;e of a picture&s;que na|ture, &s;hould never be obtruded upon unimportant pa&s;&s;ages; a con&s;tant di&s;play of &s;uch is the peculiar province of Pantomime; but when they are called for, they &s;hould be executed with all &s;pirit and exactne&s;s; the extent of figure being con&s;ulted; for what may appear graceful in a large, may be the contrary in a &s;mall one, and what may well &s;uit the latter, will often render the former puppet like.</P>
<P>If there is a ju&s;t feeling, all movements of the features will be ju&s;t, although more &s;trongly de|&s;cribed in &s;ome than in others; but the di&s;po&s;ition of body and limbs may yet be very awkward and unplea&s;ing; which is frequently verified by country actors, and &s;ometimes by tho&s;e in town; it is cer|tain that tho&s;e who under&s;tand action lea&s;t u&s;e it mo&s;t; willing to do &s;omething clever they undo, and mi&s;apply mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly; we remember amid&s;t a multitude of in&s;tances, an actor well received in Jaffier, who &s;peaking this line,  <Q REND="inline">"how I could pull thee down into my heart;"</Q> &s;o far anticipated propri|ety of motion, as to clap his hand to his brea&s;t at the

<P>Mr. Barry has often offended us, with cla&s;ping his hands five or &s;ix times in a &s;peech of as many lines; this is a proper, and becoming action upon many occa&s;ions, but, too often u&s;ed, di&s;gu&s;ts: Mr. Palmer imitates this particular fault, with great indu&s;try; upon the whole it is much to be lament|ed by all admirers of the drama, that performers don't make them&s;elves better acquainted with dif|ferent &s;tations in life; that they don't rather &s;tudy characters than gallantry and di&s;&s;ipation; that they don't collect and lay down for them&s;elves &s;ome rules, not play &s;uch a precarious game of hap hazard, right and wrong, as they do now; which occa&s;ions them to commit ten faults for the di&s;play of one beauty; a&s;k three fourths of them, why they do &s;o, and &s;o, the reply is, Mr. Garrick, Mr. Barry, Mrs. Yates, or Mrs. Barry, do &s;o; let me a&s;k tho&s;e complai&s;ant, cloying imitators, why they don't get the identical dre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e gentlemen and ladies they &s;o implicitly follow; the garments without taking mea&s;ure, will probably fit them as well as the modes they a&s;&s;ume; for &s;hame &s;ons and daughters of The&s;pis, &s;earch into, and im|prove, your own talents, capability is not &s;o much wanting at pre&s;ent as originality; work for that jewel, and you'll obtain reward; do not all old men of Drury Lane hobble mi&s;erably after Mr. Gar|rick's Lear, nor young men of Covent Garden mo|notonize after Mr. Smith's every thing.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of this work we have often expe|rienced and lamented what we fore&s;aw at fir&s;t, the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of multiplied repetitions; &s;o
<PB N="482" REF="488">
many &s;imilar circum&s;tances relative to both perfor|mers and plays, that we have found our&s;elves de|prived of language to expre&s;s our ideas differently; this however we hope will find excu&s;e and we &s;hall go forward without further mention of an in|convenience in&s;eparable from the undertaking.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick, whom we are to con&s;ider merely as an actor, is indebted to nature for an almo&s;t matchle&s;s &s;ignificance of feature, enlivened with eyes peculiarly brilliant; from an amazing flexibility of countenance, he can expre&s;s the mo&s;t contra&s;t feelings; &s;implicity, mirth, rage, grief, de&s;pair, and horror, with nearly equal excellence; hence his Abel Drugger, Benedick, Ranger, Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear, and &s;everal other characters, have no equal, po&s;&s;ibly never had; what may lie in the womb of time we know not, but think it would not be a very extravagant prophecy, to &s;et him up again&s;t any future excellencies taken in a general view; great, no doubt, he is in both depart|ments, the &s;ock and bu&s;kin; however, though that eminent genius, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, has plac|ed him equally between both, we have no &s;cruple to pronounce him mo&s;t con&s;picuous in the latter; in light &s;cenes he exhilirates, 'tis true, in a very peculiar manner; but in the graver and more impa&s;&s;ioned ones, he leads the heart captive as he plea&s;es, and rou&s;es feelings of a much more important, difficult, nature, than can ari&s;e from comedy; with her he is very plea&s;ingly &s;portive, but with her &s;i&s;ter a&s;to|ni&s;hingly powerful.</P>
<P>His peculiar excellencies are, an harmonious, di&s;|tinct, voluble, and exten&s;ive voice; without any unnatural &s;naps, the la&s;t word of all his periods, is
<PB N="483" REF="489">
as intelligible as the loude&s;t; in all &s;udden tran&s;itions his correctne&s;s, force, and judgment, are &s;carcely to be de&s;cribed; in his &s;oliloquies he happily avoids that ab&s;urd method of &s;peaking &s;olitary meditation to the audience; he appears really alone.</P>
<P>His defects, for every light has its &s;hade; is &s;hortne&s;s of figure, which however by art he evades, as much as po&s;&s;ible, by not only di&s;po&s;ing it to the greate&s;t advantage, but al&s;o by taking care to &s;hift &s;ituations &s;o often, that the eye can hardly have time to find out, and dwell upon the defect; though graceful in motion, and very much &s;o in attitude, he never could picture dignity, nor attain what is called the fine gentleman, a character indeed too languid for his active powers; though generally correct in modulation, and almo&s;t invariably &s;o, in expre&s;&s;ing the &s;en&s;e of his author, there is a re|&s;pirative drag, as if to catch breath, and &s;ome un|nece&s;&s;ary pauzes, &s;eemingly for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, which we have often been under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ilent|ly objecting to; and the &s;ame &s;ort of cen&s;ure &s;hould have &s;ufficed &s;till, but that we &s;et out with a po&s;i|tive re&s;olution to be ju&s;t, and having thus far main|tained it, we mu&s;t continue to the end.</P>
<P>The leading figures &s;hould be more minutely inve&s;tigated than tho&s;e who have le&s;s advantages; we have often regretted an adulteration of lan|guage, by changing the <HI>e</HI> and <HI>i</HI> into <HI>u</HI>; this gentle|man, and &s;everal after him, have pronounced <HI>&s;tern, &s;turn, mirth, murth, birth, burth,</HI> which is really rendering our language, already &s;ufficiently di&s;&s;o|nant, &s;till more &s;o; our Engli&s;h Ro&s;cius we could never admire in declamation, indeed he has kept pretty clear of it, and we heartily wi&s;h that, for &s;ake
<PB N="484" REF="490">
of his fame, Benedick, Ranger, Archer; Don Fe|lix, or any thing in that juvenile &s;tile, may not here|after &s;erve to &s;how his advance in life; it is not enough to &s;ay he is <HI>greater</HI> than <HI>any body el&s;e,</HI> in the true cordiality of heart, we form a hope, that he will not in any future &s;ea&s;on appear <HI>le&s;s</HI> than <HI>him|&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Quin found his deficiency, and retired, but rather too late by &s;ix or &s;even years; however what he performed in that period wanted neither freedom of figure, nor much limitation of years.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of tho&s;e ob&s;ervations we have al|ready made upon this gentleman, we have attacked the public reputation he obtained, with a&s;perity, but could not avoid it, as his tragedy, bating &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in Cato, Brutus, Zanga, Tamerlane, and Bajazet, was intolerable; he often &s;truck out a beauty, but was upon the whole &s;o unnaturally con&s;equential, &s;o monotonous and heavy, that criti|ci&s;m recollects mo&s;t part of his performance with pain, his comedy, from a cynical roughne&s;s, and where it wanted a mellow jocundity of humour, was truly plea&s;ing, and it is &s;carce any exaggeration to &s;ay, we &s;hall never &s;ee the OLD BATCHELOR, SPANISH FRYAR, PLAIN DEALER, and MASK|WELL, half &s;o ably &s;upported.</P>
<P>His figure was graceful and important, his coun|tenance open, regular, and authoritative, his eyes expre&s;&s;ive, and his voice di&s;tinctly &s;onorous; but affectation of utterance hurt the latter, and fal&s;e con&s;equence of deportment often rendered a good per&s;on ridiculous; his action was often bur|le&s;que, &s;eldom graceful, or well applied; we have mentioned this gentleman, as we &s;hall &s;ome other
<PB N="485" REF="491">
decea&s;ed capital performers, becau&s;e they come within our own aera, and may furni&s;h &s;uch as never &s;aw, or do not remember them with comparative ideas.</P>
<P>Mr. Barry, in the meridian of life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t &s;hewy, and agreeable externals, he could not fail to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s a female audience, at fir&s;t &s;ight, in his fa|vour, and even male critics mu&s;t have felt con&s;ide|rable recommendation from &s;o much elegance of ap|pearance, and harmony of countenance; his voice might ju&s;tly be called, the pipe of love, and in his eyes dwelt a langui&s;hing &s;oftne&s;s which &s;et him a|bove all competition in &s;oft &s;en&s;ations; his paternal feelings were refined and pathetic, but his decla|mation trifling; his climaxes unequalled, yet too fre|quently called upon; he often &s;eemed at a lo&s;s how to di&s;po&s;e of his hands, but was, when requi&s;ite, happy in attitude; indeed his heighth, and expan&s;e of limbs, were particularly advantageous to him in this point; in all his performance, execution &s;eemed to ri&s;e far above judgement; we have been extreme|ly concerned to &s;ee &s;uch a decayed remnant of what we once thought fabricated by nature with pecu|liar grace, crippling about this la&s;t winter, under the chill of public neglect, and the irk&s;ome pains of a &s;hattered, enfeebled, con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Look back twenty years, who would have for|med an idea of this lamentable decline, or, at lea&s;t, that there would have been a nece&s;&s;ity for expo&s;|ing it; however joco&s;e Mr. Garrick, in his occa&s;io|nal epilogue for the theatrical fund, may be, he mu&s;t have his joke in &s;uch compo&s;itions, re&s;pecting decayed actors wanting half a crown or a pot of por|ter; we &s;eriou&s;ly lament that any con&s;picuous &s;er|vant
<PB N="486" REF="492">
of the public &s;hould come to live upon cha|rity, and are certain that no per&s;on of either &s;ex, who has filled for twenty years, or more, a fir&s;t, &s;econd, or third rate, with re&s;pect, need want &s;uch an irk&s;ome, though benevolently calculated refuge; want of oeconomy is in all &s;tations pernicious, but in none more &s;o than the theatrical.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan, who does not come in improperly here, mounted the &s;tage at an early period, with the advantage of good education and natural under|&s;tanding, which gives him a ju&s;t title to the &s;tile of a &s;en&s;ible man; he appeared too at a time when the Dublin &s;tage was an Augean-&s;table of theatrical filth; no wonder any degree of merit &s;hould then be received; add to this, that he was bred in the Col|lege, which gained him countenance and protec|tion from his fellow &s;tudents; &s;o that the public, having nothing better to regale upon, and &s;eeing him over and over again, like tho&s;e very collegians who think, from u&s;e, mutton the be&s;t eating, Mr&punc; Sheridan became a &s;tandard di&s;h, till the introduc|tion of more luxurious theatrical dainties removed him to London, where he was never even fairly reli&s;hed; no performer ever conceived his author better, or marked him more correctly, but his or|gans of delivery were &s;o di&s;&s;onant, &s;o imperfect, his manner &s;o &s;tudied, his per&s;on &s;o trifling, and his action in general &s;o extravagant, that his defects greatly out-number his merits.</P>
<P>It is matter of much concern that, as a perfor|mer, he had not been confined to very few parts; as the conductor of a theatre he had great requi&s;ites, &s;pirit, knowledge, and integrity; genteel, generous, and ju&s;t, to his performers; but rather unhappy in
<PB N="487" REF="493">
a taint of courtly attachment, which drew on him a ruinous popular prejudice; his &s;tudy of oratory rendered him more &s;tiff and di&s;agreeable as an actor.</P>
<P>We mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h he had wi&s;ely con&s;idered his own intere&s;t, and made, as he might have done, a genteel independant provi&s;ion for the pre&s;ent and future days; he has made &s;ome little attempts in the dramatic way, as a writer, but &s;o trifling as not to de&s;erve mention; his treati&s;e on education, and his lectures on elocution, do him credit, not only as an author, but as a man.</P>
<P>Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, in point of literary knowledge, and &s;trong natural parts, &s;tands very high in the theatri|cal li&s;t, nor are his public talents, in &s;ome re&s;pects, exceeded by any; his externals are not very favou|rable, his countenance is not exceptionable, nor yet &s;triking; his eyes, otherwi&s;e well calculated for a &s;tage, are injured by a nearne&s;s of &s;ight, which occa&s;ions him often to contract and wink them; his action, by too much u&s;e of the left hand, is uncouth; his attitudes forced, and his deportment rather pe|dantic than graceful; his voice has power almo&s;t without end; full, harmonious and variable; his feelings are fine, and generally ju&s;t, yet his enunci|ation is &s;o incumbered with unnece&s;&s;ary multiplied empha&s;is, that he often appears in the painful &s;itua|tion of a man ga&s;ping for breath.</P>
<P>This gentleman has been but an unfortunate ma|nager, and we wi&s;h for his own &s;ake, as well as that of the Engli&s;h &s;tage, which has been, and is deplo|rably &s;upplied in his &s;tile, that he had never left London; from his medium time of life he may be e&s;teemed with all faults, the tragedy &s;heet anchor at pre&s;ent; but never let the luring jade, comedy, de|coy
<PB N="488" REF="494">
him into the circle of ridicule, or contempt, with her enticing &s;miles; &s;he was not made for him, nor he for her.</P>
<P>Mr. Ro&s;s! perhaps the mo&s;t ungrateful &s;on of nature that &s;he ever produced; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of exceeding good requi&s;ites, &s;ave an unmeaning countenance, has by matchle&s;s neglect &s;unk him&s;elf almo&s;t below no|tice; indu&s;try and per&s;everance might by this time have &s;et him foremo&s;t in public e&s;teem, whereas we find him very little u&s;ed, and le&s;s &s;poken of, &s;o early, we imagine as the age of forty: his voice is plea&s;ing and exten&s;ive, his feelings, when properly called upon, have &s;pirit, and pathos; his per&s;on, before corpulence enlarged it, was very agreeable, his de|portment and action free, his utterance ea&s;y, yet pointed and di&s;tinct; even now, if he would promi&s;e, and keep his word, to take pains with Jaffier, Ca&s;|talio, E&s;&s;ex, &amp;c. we &s;hould &s;ee him with much more plea&s;ure than any other pre&s;ent performer; we never wi&s;h any thing more agreeable than his Lord Townly and young Bevil <HI>have</HI> been.</P>
<P>Mr. Smith, a meritorius contra&s;t to the pre|ceding gentleman, recommends him&s;elf to ma|nagers and familiarizes him&s;elf to the public, by an uncommon &s;hare of a&s;&s;iduity; the talents he has are not &s;pared but often through nece&s;&s;ity, mi&s;ap|plied, as we have &s;hewn in the cour&s;e of our re|marks; we could wi&s;h him totally devoted to gen|teel, &s;prightly comedy, as his expre&s;&s;ion and feelings never do ju&s;tice to the more important pa&s;&s;ages of pa&s;&s;ion, and his declamation lo&s;es due effect from levity, we believe, not only from our own, but very extended critical opinion, that &s;carce any per|former ever played &s;o much, to affect the heart &s;o
<PB N="489" REF="495">
little; but an agreeable per&s;on, genteel carriage, engaging countenance, and a di&s;tinct, &s;mooth, pow|erful, voice, though monotonous, carry him re&s;pec|tably.</P>
<P>Mr. Reddi&s;h, in point of pecuniary advantage and &s;tation, is on the &s;tage at a very lucky time, but we cannot &s;ay &s;o much in re&s;pect of critical fame; for though a very u&s;eful performer, he never was de&s;igned to be a great one, he ever &s;hould have been in Mr. Havard's line, and that only; his expre&s;&s;ion is not always a ju&s;t comment upon his author; his feelings are not adequate to violent pa&s;&s;ions, which has occa&s;ioned us more than once to &s;mile at his ef|forts in Alexander; the be&s;t character he plays of any force and variety is Edgar, level &s;peaking &s;eems be&s;t &s;uited to his voice and manner, his per&s;on is manly, but neither genteel nor con&s;equential; his tones are di&s;tinct and agreeable enough, but too limited for climaxes of material extent; we were &s;hocked at the malevolent irony of &s;ome news paper remarks in the <HI>Ledger</HI> &s;ome time &s;ince, which &s;aid this gentleman, in many capital parts, was &s;econd to none but Mr. Garrick; how could he have pro|voked any writer to advance &s;uch an ab&s;urdity, or how could any writer, unprovoked, attempt to damn him with &s;uch fal&s;e prai&s;e?</P>
<P>Mr. Savigny we wi&s;h not to &s;peak of, as we are under an indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing Obadiah Prim's words, who, when a&s;ked what he di&s;likes a|bout Sir Phillip Modelove, replies, thy per&s;on, thy manner, thy every thing; if nece&s;&s;ity had forced this gentleman on the &s;tage we &s;hould have lament|ed him &s;incerely, but as it is, we are rather induced to wonder at, than condemn the devotion of &s;uch
<PB N="490" REF="496">
trifling requi&s;ites to theatric action; a diminutive per&s;on, without any grace, and a voice that has not one tolerable note above the level of a common con|ver&s;ation; there is an evident aim at, and very faint, therefore di&s;agreeable, &s;imilitude to Mr. Garrick, that is, to his greate&s;t dificiencies: we heard a &s;ort of a critical pun uttered on &s;eeing this performer in Cyrus, which may not be unworthy notice; if, &s;ays a wag, Mr. Savigny's razors touch a beard no bet|ter than his features, and utterance, do the pa&s;&s;ions, it mu&s;t be torture to be &s;haved by them.</P>
<P>Mr. Powell, though alas! no more, mu&s;t not pa&s;s unnoticed; his per&s;on was no way &s;triking, yet of good &s;ize and proportion; his face rather vacant, but plea&s;ing; his voice harmonious, and pathetic; his addre&s;s genteel, but his action limited, and inex|pre&s;&s;ive: in old men, where his features were ren|dered more expre&s;&s;ive by art, and where the feel|ings &s;eemed natural to him, he perhaps never had a &s;uperior but Mr. Garrick, 'tis true he took, or ra|ther was obliged to take, too large a field of action, and &s;ometimes get out of his depth; but almo&s;t in every point of view, he was much better than any thing he has left behind him.</P>
<P>Mr. Holland, as a tragedian, made up of &s;tiff|ne&s;s, di&s;&s;onance, and violence, re&s;pectable in figure, and powerful in voice, both which he mi&s;|u&s;ed abominably; as a comedian, in the Plain Dea|ler, Sir William Evans, and that &s;tile, he de&s;erved the prai&s;e which was lavi&s;hed on him in ether parts that he did not do half &s;o well: he &s;trutted &s;everal years in Mr&punc; Garrick's &s;hoes, &s;lip-&s;hod, and was, with all his faults, a great lo&s;s to the theatre, as may appear from viewing the dreadful partition of

<P>Mr. Ben&s;ley, if this gentleman was but half as great a favourite with the public as he is with the manager, he would be happily &s;tationed; but very partial advantages cannot effect this; his per&s;on is &s;light, his features contracted and peevi&s;h, his deportment fal&s;ely con&s;equential, his action mo&s;tly extravagant, and his voice rather har&s;h; we always view him mo&s;t favourably in a Turki&s;h dre&s;s, though he can never make a Turki&s;h countenance, his features being much more of the Chine&s;e ca&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Clarke is very re&s;pectable in appearance, and performance; he is as &s;eldom out of his lati|tude as any one we know, and if he never mounts a great height, he never &s;inks much below a proper level, he is literally a good, cha&s;te, actor, but &s;ome|times rather phlegmatic.</P>

Mr. Vernon, an exceeding good comic performer, though merely u&s;ed as a &s;inger, which we profe&s;s not to judge off. Mr. Dodd, the theatrical cockatoo, &s;pirited and plea&s;ing in the coxcomb-&s;tile. Mr. Love, the bloody murderer of blank ver&s;e, but a good Boni|face,
<PB N="493" REF="499">
Cacafogo, and a re&s;pectable Fal&s;taff; not a|mi&s;s in Sir John Brute.</P>
<P>Mr. King, in the comic walk of acting, has for &s;ome years &s;hewn more force, and variety, than any cotemporary; his figure is &s;mart, ea&s;y, genteel, his countenance plea&s;ing, his features archly expre&s;&s;ive, his eyes &s;pirited, and &s;ignificant, his voice di&s;tinct; his utterance remarkably voluble, and his action well adapted.</P>
<P>Mr. Woodward, who has &s;uffered le&s;s impair from time, than any man in public life of his &s;tanding, is amazingly great in <HI>outr&eacute;,</HI> and whim&s;ical, charac|ters, far beyond competition: in the fop &s;tile he is al&s;o him&s;elf alone; his per&s;on is genteel, his deport|ment plea&s;ing, but rather too picture&s;que, too &s;tudied; comedy has &s;et her &s;eal upon his features, and laughter dwells in his eye; we have &s;een this gentleman lately with as much, or more, plea&s;ure, than we did twenty years ago; his vivacity is ama|zing.</P>
<P>Mr. Yates, a very ju&s;t comedian, who is &s;eldom beholden to trick for applau&s;e; his forte we have always thought is old men, yet we admit his Sharp, and Brainworm, to be inimitable.</P>
<P>Mr. Shuter, a luxurious performer, who has great humour both in looks and expre&s;&s;ion, but wants cha&s;tity of character, and diligence; the former of|ten runs him into buffoonery, the latter into imper|fectne&s;s, and non&s;en&s;e. Mr. Par&s;ons has not &s;o much fun, but more correctne&s;s. Mr We&s;ton, the unparalelled elde&s;t born of &s;implicity, who&s;e Dr. La&s;t and Mawworm, mu&s;t unbend the mo&s;t rigid brow.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="500">We &s;hall conclude male performers with Mr. Foote, who, as he never has attached him&s;elf to a &s;phere of general action, we mu&s;t merely con&s;ider in his own pieces; in which he acts with the &s;ame inimitable &s;pirit that he writes; as his ideas and cha|racters are truly original, &s;o is his repre&s;entation of the parts he plays; his forceable merit has been &s;ub&s;tantially proved by the amazing &s;ums he has drawn at different periods, but particularly the la&s;t four &s;ummers &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; if any other proof was nece&s;&s;ary, we could furni&s;h a very &s;trong one by of|fering to comparative view the impotent, di&s;gu&s;tful, illiberal, attempts that have lately been made upon his pieces, at both hou&s;es, by &s;ome theatrical quix|ote's, to their own utter di&s;grace, and indeed that of the managers; his pointed rapidity, his peculiar &s;ignificance, and his laughable tran&s;itions, &s;upport|ed with unbating fire, and uncommon whim, &s;et him above all efforts of imitation; and it may be &s;aid of him not only as an author, but as an actor, that he &s;natches graces beyond the reach of art.</P>
<P>The lower members of each theatre, whom we have not mentioned, nor could not without being tedious, certainly in general de&s;erve the compli|ment of being much fitter for their humble &s;tations than the leaders are for theirs; the rank, and file, rather &s;hame their field officers.</P>
<P>Mrs. Woffington had an elegant, plea&s;ing, appear|ance, and great comic &s;pirit, but there was a pe|culiar taint of affectation, not &s;uitable to a real fine lady; &s;he always &s;eemed too con&s;cious of her per|&s;onal charms, therefore too &s;eldom threw off &s;elf to a&s;&s;ume character, hence aro&s;e a &s;amene&s;s that we could not approve; her tragedy exhibited &s;ome
<PB N="495" REF="501">
&s;trokes finely imagined, and well executed, but up|on the whole, &s;he wore the bu&s;kin with a very ill grace; &s;he appeared to more advantage in mens cloaths, than any other female we have &s;aw, and was not only very plea&s;ing, but very characteri&s;tic, in that difficult undertaking, Sir Harry Wildair; &s;he was relieved by death from the near approach|ing neglect of both public and private admirers; her voice was the greate&s;t defect &s;he laboured under.</P>
<P>Mrs. Cibber, was very agreeable in her per&s;on, happy in the di&s;po&s;ition of it, more happy in a &s;et of features uncommonly expre&s;&s;ive, and mo&s;t happy in a plaintive, mellow, powerful, voice, &s;he had no turn at all for comedy; in grief and di&s;traction, no idea could go beyond her execution; and her Ali|cia, Con&s;tance, &amp;c. mu&s;t ever be remembered with admiration; yet after all &s;he had a reli&s;h of the old ti-tum-ti, which often gave us offence.</P>
<P>Mrs. Pritchard was graceful and engaging, ca|pable of commanding not only re&s;pect but regard; her merits were very general, nearly equal both in the grave and the gay; it is not ea&s;y to conceive one and the &s;ame per&s;on &s;o capital in Lady Mac|beth, Jane Shore, Beatrice, and Catharine, &s;he had good feelings, but blubbered in grief; her voice was rather coar&s;e, but well modulated, and her per&s;on too corpulent, yet &s;o well deported as to carry off its &s;uperfluity with ea&s;e; her equal will not adorn the theatre, the&s;e many years.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bellamy trod clo&s;e on the heels of Mrs. Cibber, &s;he had, we think, the more amiable counte|nance of the two, though it was not marked with &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility, her per&s;on though &s;mall, was very &s;atisfactory, and her expre&s;&s;ions of rapture, be|yond
<PB N="496" REF="502">
any thing we have ever heard; &s;he came &s;ome|what nearer comedy, than her great competitor, but never de&s;erved much prai&s;e in that &s;tile.</P>
<P>Mrs. Barry has great advantage over the fir&s;t, and la&s;t mentioned ladies, as being far beyond either in comedy, and not much behind them in tragedy; &s;he is graceful, genteel, &s;pirited, and feeling; but from a defect in her eyes, not &s;o de&s;criptive in counte|nance, as might be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Yates, in the pre&s;ent clouded, theatrical hemi&s;phere, &s;hines a con&s;tellation, but we think her merit very confined; a good per&s;on, regular but haughty features, and powerful voice, carry her well through rage, and di&s;dain; but &s;he is deficient in tender feelings, and hurries the forceable ones to a degree of violence, which critici&s;m mu&s;t condemn; we are &s;orry to differ &s;o much from public opinion, which &s;eems &s;o warm in this lady's favour; &s;he has not a trace of comedy about her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Abington has all the advantages of Mrs. Woffington, with more variety and more plea&s;antry; &s;he is beyond a doubt our be&s;t comic actre&s;s, and fully de&s;erves the favour &s;he enjoys. Mi&s;s Pope has con&s;iderable merit, in &s;mart voluble comedy, but is not totally engaging as to her per&s;on. Mi&s;s Macklin had exten&s;ive, &s;pirited, abilities, but is on the decline. Mrs. Bulkley, and Mrs. Baddely, are both pretty women, and agreeable actre&s;&s;es, where nothing great is wanting. Mrs. Mattocks, a very u&s;eful actre&s;s, but rather under-acts tragedy, and over-does comedy, &s;inging we take no notice of. Mi&s;s Catley nothing of a &s;peaker: Mrs. Fitz|gerald, very little better. Mrs. Gardner, in Mr.
<PB N="497" REF="503">
Foote's pieces excellent. Mrs. Green, a very good &s;ub&s;titute for Mrs. Clive. Mrs. Hopkins, a very bad one. Mrs. Clive, peculiarly happy in low hu|mour; who with a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable face, and per|&s;on, was always the joy of her audience, when &s;he kept clear of any thing &s;erious or genteel. Mrs. W. Barry, a very tolerable &s;econd Woman. Mi&s;s Miller, nothing but partial managerical favour could have produced, or &s;upported, this Lady.</P>
<P>Thus the DRAMATIC CENSOR takes cordial leave of the reader, con&s;cious of many faults, not without hopes of &s;ome merit; and wi&s;hes, that if any other work, upon this plan, and &s;ubject, &s;hould hereafter be &s;tarted, there may be more &s;ubjects for prai&s;e, and fewer for cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>We cannot di&s;mi&s;s this volume, without grate|fully acknowledging the general encouragement with which the public have honoured our critical pur&s;uit, and the &s;elf approbation we feel from hav|ing pre&s;erved one uniform &s;pirit of impartiality through the whole, agreeable to our free and un|bia&s;&s;ed judgment. As a candid review of the &s;tage was the only motive for this undertaking, and a &s;e|cond edition is now preparing for the pre&s;s, we take this opportunity of &s;oliciting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the ingenious in general, in order to render the work as perfect and plea&s;ing as po&s;&s;ible. At the &s;ame time, we hereby promi&s;e, that whatever al|terations

<HEAD>ANSWER to our late CORRESPONDENTS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER thanking A. B. and E. M. for the friendly corre&s;pondence with which the Dramatic Cen&s;or has been indulged, we declare our&s;elves hap|py in the idea of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for a &s;econd edition, every remark for enrichment, or correction, &s;hall be carefully attended to, every judicious alteration adopted, and every po&s;&s;ible &s;tep taken to make the work complete; we lament the indi&s;po&s;ition of our friend E.
