<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE LAKE AT <HI>KESWICK.</HI></HEAD>
<P>&mdash;IN my way to the north from <HI>Hagley</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed thro' <HI>Dovedale</HI>; and to &s;ay the truth, was di&s;appointed in it. When I came to <HI>Buxton,</HI> I vi&s;ited another or two of their romantic &s;cenes; but the&s;e are in|ferior to <HI>Dovedale.</HI> They are but poor mi|niatures of KESWICK; which exceeds them more in grandeur than I can give you to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">magine; and more if po&s;&s;ible in beauty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">han in grandeur.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of the narrow &s;lip of valley which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;een at <HI>Dovedale,</HI> you have at KESWICK a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t amphitheatre, in circumference above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">wenty miles. In&s;tead of a meagre rivulet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> noble living lake, ten miles round, of an
<PB N="4" REF="3">
oblong form, adorned with variety of wood|ed i&s;lands. The rocks indeed of <HI>Dovedale</HI> are finely wild, pointed, and irregular; but the hills are both little and unanimated; and the margin of the brook is poorly edg|ed with weeds, mora&s;s, and bru&s;hwood.&mdash; But at KESWICK, you will, on one &s;ide of the lake, &s;ee a rich and beautiful land&s;kip of cultivated fields, ri&s;ing to the eye in fine inequalities, with noble groves of oak, hap|pily di&s;per&s;ed; and climbing the adjacent hills, &s;hade above &s;hade, in the mo&s;t vari|ous and picture&s;que forms. On the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore, you will find rocks and cliffs of &s;tupendous height, hanging broken over the lake in horrible grandeur, &s;ome of them a thou&s;and feet high, the woods climbing up their &s;teep and &s;haggy &s;ides, where mor|tal foot never yet approached. On the&s;e dreadful heights the eagles build their ne&s;ts: A variety of waterfalls are &s;een pouring from their &s;ummits, and tumbling in va&s;t &s;heets from rock to rock in rude and terrible magnificence: While on all &s;ides of this immen&s;e amphitheatre the lofty mountains ri&s;e round, piercing the clouds in &s;hapes as &s;piry and fanta&s;tic, as the very rocks of <HI>Dovedale.</HI>&mdash;To this I mu&s;t add
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the frequent and bold projection of the cliffs into the lake, forming noble bays and pro|montories: In other parts they finely retire from it, and often open in abrupt cha&s;ms or clefts, thro' which at hand, you &s;ee rich and cultivated vales, and beyond the&s;e at va|rious di&s;tances, mountain ri&s;ing over moun|tain; among which, new pro&s;pects pre&s;ent them&s;elves in mi&s;t, till the eye is lo&s;t in an agreeable perplexity:
<Q><L>Where active Fancy travels beyond Sen&s;e,</L>
<L>And pictures things un&s;een.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>Were I to analy&s;e the two places into their con&s;tituent principles, I &s;hould tell you that the full perfection of KESWICK con&s;i&s;ts of three circum&s;tances, <HI>Beauty, Hor|ror,</HI> and <HI>Immen&s;ity</HI> united; the &s;econd of which is alone found in <HI>Dovedale.</HI> Of beau|ty it hath little: Nature having left it al|mo&s;t a de&s;art: Neither its &s;mall extent, nor the diminutive and lifele&s;s form of the hills admit magnificence.&mdash;But to give you a complete idea of the&s;e three perfections, as they are joined in KESWICK, would require the united powers of <HI>Claude, Salvator,</HI> and <HI>Pou&s;&s;in.</HI> The fir&s;t &s;hould throw his delicate &s;un&s;hine over the cultivated vales, the &s;cat|tered
<PB N="6" REF="5">
cots, the groves, the lake, and wood|ed i&s;lands. The &s;econd &s;hould da&s;h out the horror of the rugged cliffs, the &s;teeps, the hanging woods, and foaming waterfalls; while the grand pencil of <HI>Pou&s;&s;in</HI> &s;hould crown the whole with the maje&s;ty of the impending mountains.</P>
<P>So much for what I would call the <HI>per|manent</HI> beauties of this a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene. Were I not afraid of being tire&s;ome, I could now dwell as long on its <HI>varying</HI> or <HI>acciden|tal</HI> beauties. I would &s;ail round the lake, anchor in every bay, and land you on every promontory and i&s;land. I would point out the perpetual change of pro&s;pect: The woods, rocks, cliffs, and mountains, by turns vani&s;hing or ri&s;ing into view: Now gaining on the &s;ight, hanging over our heads in their full dimen&s;ions, beautifully dreadful; and now, by a change of &s;ituation, a&s;&s;uming new romantic &s;hapes, retiring and le&s;&s;ening on the eye, and in&s;en&s;ibly lo&s;ing them&s;elves in an azure mi&s;t. I would re|mark the contra&s;t of light and &s;hade, pro|duced by the morning and evening &s;un; the one gilding the we&s;tern, and the other the ea&s;tern &s;ide of this immen&s;e amphithea|tre; while the va&s;t &s;hadow projected by the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
mountains buries the oppo&s;ite part in a deep and purple gloom, which the eye can hardly penetrate: The natural variety of colouring which the &s;everal objects produce is no le&s;s wonderful and plea&s;ing: The rul|ing tincts in the valley being tho&s;e of azure, green, and gold, yet ever various, ari&s;ing from an intermixture of the lake, the woods, the gra&s;s, and corn-fields: The&s;e are fine|ly contra&s;ted by the grey rocks and cliffs; and the whole heightened by the yellow &s;treams of light, the purple hues, and mi&s;ty azure of the mountains. Sometimes a &s;e|rene air and clear &s;ky di&s;clo&s;e the tops of the highe&s;t hills: At others, you &s;ee clouds in|volving their &s;ummits, re&s;ting on their &s;ides, or de&s;cending to their ba&s;e, and rolling among the vallies, as in a va&s;t furnace.&mdash; When the winds are high, they roar among the cliffs and caverns like peals of thunder; then, too, the clouds are &s;een in va&s;t bodies &s;weeping along the hills in gloomy great|ne&s;s, while the lake joins the tumult and to&s;&s;es like a &s;ea: But in calm weather the whole &s;cene becomes new: The lake is a perfect mirror; and the land&s;kip in all its beauty, i&s;lands, fields, woods, rocks, and mountains, are &s;een inverted, and floating
<PB N="8" REF="7">
on its &s;urface. I will now carry you to the top of a cliff, where if you dare approach the ridge, a new &s;cene of a&s;toni&s;hment pre|&s;ents it&s;elf, where the valley, lake, and i&s;lands, &s;eem laying at your feet; where this expan&s;e of water appears dimini&s;hed to a little pool amid&s;t the va&s;t immea&s;ureable objects that &s;urround it; for here the &s;um|mits of more di&s;tant hill appear before tho&s;e you had already &s;een; and ri&s;ing behind each other in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ranges and azure groups of craggy and broken &s;teeps, form an immen&s;e and awful picture, which can only be expre&s;&s;ed by the image of a tem|pe&s;tuous &s;ea of mountains.&mdash;Let me now conduct you down again to the valley, and conclude with one circum&s;tance more; which is, that a walk by &s;till moon-light (at which time the di&s;tant water-falls are heard in all their variety of &s;ound) among the&s;e inchanting dales, opens a &s;cene of &s;uch de|licate beauty, repo&s;e, and &s;olemnity, as ex|ceeds all de&s;cription.</P>
