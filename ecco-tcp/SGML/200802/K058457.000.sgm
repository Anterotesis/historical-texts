<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>ALMOST every moral Writer or E&s;&s;ayi&s;t that I have happened to meet with, from the days of Solomon to the pre&s;ent aera, have com|plained of the profligacy and degeneracy of their Times. From hence we are led to be|lieve, that folly and vice have been equally prevalent in all ages, and that there is no &s;uch
<PB N="ii" REF="4">
period to be found in the an|nals of Human Nature, as that Golden Age in which Wi&s;dom and Virtue dwelt with Men.</P>
<P>THAT perfection is not the lot of mortals, I readily admit, and cannot therefore prefume to point out the exact modes of any particular period of time as objects of general imi|tation; but without venturing to oppo&s;e my &s;light opinion again&s;t the common and wil|lingly-received
<PB N="iii" REF="5">
adage, <HI>that the world is ju&s;t as good as it was a thou&s;and years ago,</HI> I will pro|nounce, that though Virtue and Vice may have travelled progre&s;&s;ively upon the &s;ame &s;cale &s;ince the Creation to this day, the influence of Folly, and her in&s;eparable companions Vanity and Di&s;&s;ipation, have, within the pre&s;ent century, been extended in Britain to a degree not only unknown to, but inconceivable by, our Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="6">THE chief cau&s;es of this &s;ad effect, we are told, originate in the improper plan of educa|tion which has been adopted for our young Ladies. But as new and u&s;eful lights have been thrown upon this &s;ubject by abler pens than mine, par|ticularly by tho&s;e two excel|lent and elegant Writers Mrs. CHAPONE and Mi&s;s MORE, I &s;hall not dwell upon it; but mean humbly to offer my &s;en|timents to tho&s;e of my &s;ex who,
<PB N="v" REF="7">
having pa&s;&s;ed through the re|&s;traints nece&s;&s;arily impo&s;ed on youth, are ready to launch into the tempe&s;tuous ocean of life, without any chart to &s;ail by but their native innocence and un&s;u&s;pecting chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHILE they pre&s;erve the fir&s;t, they will not &s;trike again&s;t the rock mo&s;t fatal to their peace; but grant they &s;hould e&s;cape that imminent danger, there are a thou&s;and hidden
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
&s;hoals within this &s;tormy &s;ea, where female happine&s;s may &s;uffer wreck. From the&s;e it is my mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ave them, and &s;end them floating down the &s;tream of Time load|ed with days and honour.</P>
<P>AS it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed that a thorough knowledge of the art we mean to teach is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in every &s;cience, the Author of the fol|lowing E&s;&s;ays, with the true&s;t
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
gratitude to the Almighty for &s;uch an ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing, pre&s;umes to hope, that after thirty years of uninterrupted happine&s;s in the marriage-&s;tate, &s;he may be deemed qualified, at lea&s;t as far as experience can direct, to &s;peak upon the mo&s;t intere&s;ting of all earthly &s;ub|jects to tho&s;e who are but entering on that &s;tate of pro|bation, wherein a &s;trict ad|herence to its delightful duties mu&s;t lead to the final reward of happine&s;s here and hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the time that a Woman enters into the holy and ho|nourable &s;tate of matrimony, &s;he becomes accountable for her con|duct both towards God and Man. Separated from the fo&s;tering care of tender and indulgent parents,
<PB N="2" REF="11">
who have hitherto directed her foot&s;teps in the way that &s;he &s;hould walk, and left to chu&s;e her path amid&s;t the &s;tormy or the flowery way, where &s;hall &s;he find a clue to direct her inexperience through the labyrinth that now lies before her? One unerring guide remains, which if &s;he truly &s;eeks,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his word will be a lanthorn to her feet, and a light unto her paths;"</Q>
and when her father and her mother for&s;ake her, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he will take her up."</Q></P>
<P>AS the &s;pring to the year, &s;o is youth to the &s;oul, the &s;ea&s;on of blooming virtue; without blo&s;|&s;oms
<PB N="3" REF="12">
there can be no fruit, and the barren mind that is not early im|bued with the knowledge of the love of God, which alone con&s;ti|tutes our happine&s;s here, and our hopes hereafter, will &s;eek in vain for the delight it yields in tho&s;e maturer days, when worldly cares and di&s;appointments have &s;oured the natural benevolence of the heart, and rendered it callous to the refined feelings of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>ZEAL without knowledge is the parent of bigotry; and bigotry is too often the adopted religion of wrinkles and grey hairs. From
<PB N="4" REF="13">
hence it &s;ometimes happens, that devotion a&s;&s;umes the ma&s;k of au|&s;terity, which, by concealing the <HI>beauty of holine&s;s,</HI> mu&s;t rather deter than invite the inexperienced mind from entering into that &s;ervice
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"which is perfect freedom; who&s;e ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and who&s;e paths are tho&s;e of peace."</Q></P>
<P>BUT whil&s;t the ble&s;&s;ings and plea&s;ures of youth flow around us, the heart mu&s;t naturally be ex|panded with gratitude; gratitude produces prai&s;e, and prai&s;e is &s;urely the mo&s;t acceptable &s;acrifice that a
<PB N="5" REF="14">
human creature can offer to the great Author of good. But, alas! &s;urrounded by the delights of life, we too frequently become forget|ful of the &s;ource from whence they are derived; and whil&s;t we are indulging all our appetites in the delicious &s;tream of happine&s;s, it becomes impregnated with the qualities of <HI>Leth&eacute;,</HI> and renders us unmindful of its fountain.</P>
<P>LET then the &s;en&s;ible and inno|cent Bride
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"remember her Creator in the days of her youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh when &s;he &s;hall &s;ay,

Doctor Young &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The whole creation cannot furni&s;h a more lovely &s;ight, than a beautiful young woman upon her knees addre&s;&s;ing her Maker in fervent prayer;"</Q>
and if I might pre|&s;ume to add my &s;entiments, I would &s;ay, that it is a &s;ight at which men and angels &s;hould rejoice.</P>
<P>EVERY young and innocent wo|man mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily feel a painful diffidence on her fir&s;t entrance into
<PB N="7" REF="16">
the bu&s;tle of life. A thorough &s;en&s;e of religion alone can di&s;pel her apprehen&s;ions, give calmne&s;s to her mind, and &s;teadine&s;s to her conduct. For while we con&s;ider our&s;elves under the immediate guidance and protection of an all-wi&s;e and all-powerful Being, what have we to fear? True confidence ari&s;es from &s;uch a dependence, and fills the mind with
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that &s;weet peace which goodne&s;s bo&s;oms ever."</Q></P>
<P>MR. ADDISON very ju&s;tly ob|&s;erves,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a mind which has the lea&s;t turn to religion, na|turally flies to it in affliction."</Q>
<PB N="8" REF="17">
We then begin to feel our own in&s;ufficiency, we are humbled by &s;orrow, and perhaps only then de|duce real &s;atisfaction from a tho|rough conviction that there is a &s;uperior Being, who&s;e aid is gra|ciou&s;ly promi&s;ed to tho&s;e who &s;in|cerely &s;eek it.</P>
<P>BUT though
<Q><L>" Religion's force divine is be&s;t di&s;play'd</L>
<L>" In a de&s;ertion of all human aid,"</L></Q>
we mu&s;t by no means pre&s;ume to hope for the con&s;olation it can be&s;tow in the days of affliction, if we have neglected to receive and
<PB N="9" REF="18">
&s;ubmit to its legi&s;lative authority in the hours of youth and pro&s;pe|rity. <Q REND="inline">"You mu&s;t fir&s;t apply to it as the guide of life, before you can have recour&s;e to it as the refuge of &s;orrow<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Blair's Sermons.</NOTE>."</Q> But if labouring under the &s;evere&s;t ills which this world can inflict, we can truly &s;ay, I have endeavoured to do my duty in the &s;tate I have been called to, I have walked humbly with my God, have made my peace with him, and pa|tiently &s;ubmit to his all-wi&s;e de|crees;

&s;oothe the complaints of grief, lighten the pre&s;&s;ure of old age, and furni&s;h to the bed of &s;ickne&s;s a cordial of more grate|ful reli&s;h and more &s;overeign virtue, than any which this world can afford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Blair's Sermons.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH the motives which I have hitherto urged for an early attachment to our religious duties &s;eem only to relate to the happy individual who, like Solomon,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"has &s;ought Wi&s;dom early, and found her,"</Q>
there can be no
<PB N="11" REF="20">
doubt of the innumerable bene|fits which &s;ociety mu&s;t reap, as far as her influence extends, from the conduct and example of a truly religious woman. In whatever point of view &s;he may be placed, as Daughter, Wife, Mother, Si&s;ter, or Friend, the governing principle of her life, the love of God, will operate upon her conduct in the relative duties of her &s;tation, and render that perfect in each and every degree.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude this im|portant &s;ubject, without pre&s;enting to my fair Readers that elegant
<PB N="12" REF="21">
portrait which the wi&s;e&s;t of men and divine&s;t of poets has given them, of one whom they &s;hould endeavour to imitate, if they de|&s;ire to attain happine&s;s and honour in this life, and everla&s;ting felicity in that to come:</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the union of hearts is uni|ver&s;ally allowed to be the bond of marriage, &s;o the entering into &s;uch a connection without po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing
<PB N="16" REF="25">
the e&s;&s;ence or fir&s;t principle on which it &s;hould be founded, mu&s;t render the ceremony of none effect, and can in rea&s;on and equity only be con&s;idered as a &s;tate of legal pro&s;titution. To &s;peak of conjugal felicity to the wretched victims of parental authority, of avarice, or poverty, would be ab&s;urd or cruel, as they mu&s;t either be incapable of forming an idea of it, or doomed for ever to lament its lo&s;s.</P>
<P>I THEREFORE, in this &s;ection, particularly addre&s;s my&s;elf to the happy few whom Love unites in
<PB N="17" REF="26">
Hymen's ro&s;y bands, and profe&s;s to teach the art of making their happine&s;s as permanent as the in|&s;tability of mere mortal natures will admit of.</P>
<P>LOVE is a term &s;o very vague and indi&s;criminate, as it is gene|rally applied, that it would be ex|tremely difficult to inve&s;tigate its nature from its effects, in any other ca&s;e but that of marriage; as the modes, perhaps, of feeling, or at lea&s;t of expre&s;&s;ing it, vary, ac|cording to the temper, manner, or
<PB N="18" REF="27">
&s;ituation, of each individual who either feels or feigns the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT Conjugal Affection is by no means &s;ubject to &s;uch equivocal ap|pearances; it is tenderne&s;s height|ened by pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;trengthened by e&s;teem. It is unmixed with any &s;elfi&s;h or &s;en&s;ual allay, tending &s;olely to promote the happine&s;s of its object here and hereafter.</P>
<P>SUCH an elevated &s;tate of happi|ne&s;s as mu&s;t re&s;ult from the af|fection I have de&s;cribed, when mutual, mu&s;t &s;urely be the acm&eacute;
<PB N="19" REF="28">
of human felicity. But, as the point of perfection is that of de|clen&s;ion al&s;o, it will require much pains, but they are plea&s;ing ones, to make the ever-turning wheel of &s;ublunary bli&s;s keep &s;teady to the &s;ummit it has reached, or at lea&s;t to prevent its rolling down the rugged precipice where jealou&s;y, di&s;gu&s;t, and grief, have marked the horrid road.</P>
<P>THE di&s;appointments of human life mu&s;t ever be proportioned to the extravagance of our expecta|tions. Too great an ardour to be
<PB N="02" REF="29">
ble&s;&s;ed is frequently the &s;ource of mi&s;ery. A life of tran&s;port is not the lot of mortals. While we ac|cept, we &s;hould cha&s;ti&s;e our joys, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"le&s;t while we cla&s;p we kill them."</Q></P>
<P>THAT concord of &s;ouls which con&s;titutes the happine&s;s of mar|riage, like a full concert, requires all <HI>the parts obliged</HI> to fill their &s;e|veral &s;tations in perfect time and place; for though the heart may lead the band, and &s;et out in per|fect harmony, one jarring note de|&s;troys the rapturous &s;train, and turns the whole to di&s;cord. For this rea&s;on, I con&s;ider a parity of
<PB N="21" REF="30">
under&s;tanding and temper to be as nece&s;&s;ary towards forming an happy marriage, as an equality of years, rank and fortune.</P>
<P>BUT grant the&s;e circum&s;tances all conjoin and make the union perfect, remember, my fair Friends, &s;atiety &s;ucceeds to rapture, as &s;ure as night to day. Be it your pro|vince, then, to keep your hu&s;band's heart from &s;inking into the incur|able di&s;ea&s;e of ta&s;tele&s;s apathy. Do not rely too much upon your per&s;onal charms, however great, to pre&s;erve the conque&s;t they may have gained.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="31">BY a proper attention to your hu&s;band, you will ea&s;ily di&s;cover the bent of his genius and inclina|tions. To that turn all your thoughts, and let your words and actions &s;olely tend to that great point. The kindne&s;s of your at|tention will awaken his, and gra|titude will &s;trengthen his affection, imperceptibly even to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>OUR fir&s;t Parent ju&s;tifies his fondne&s;s for Eve, to Raphael, upon this principle:
<Q><L>" Neither her out&s;ide formed &s;o fair, &amp;c.</L>
<L>" So much delights me, as tho&s;e graceful acts,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="32">" Tho&s;e thou&s;and decencies, that daily flow</L>
<L>" From all her words and actions mixed with love,</L>
<L>" And &s;weet compliance, which declare unfeigned</L>
<L>" Union of mind, or in us both one &s;oul;</L>
<L>" Harmony to behold in wedded pair,</L>
<L>" More grateful than harmonious &s;ound to the ear."</L></Q></P>
<P>IN an age like this, when we may &s;uppo&s;e that every young Lady de&s;erves the epithet with which Adam addre&s;&s;es his wife, <HI>Accompli&s;hed Eve,</HI> it mu&s;t be le&s;s difficult than it might have been for their female ance&s;tors, to &s;e|cure
<PB N="24" REF="33">
the affections of a hu&s;band already prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in their favour. Let them but exert the &s;ame talents, with the &s;ame de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, which they &s;hewed before marriage, and I venture to pronounce that they will &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>A LOVE of power and authority is natural to men; and wherever this inclination is mo&s;t indulged, will be the &s;ituation of their choice. Every man ought to be the prin|cipal object of attention in his fa|mily; of cour&s;e he &s;hould feel him&s;elf happier at home than in
<PB N="25" REF="34">
any other place. It is, doubtle&s;s, the great bu&s;ine&s;s of a woman's life to render his home plea&s;ing to her hu&s;band; he will then delight in her &s;ociety, and not &s;eek abroad for alien amu&s;ements. A hu&s;band may, po&s;&s;ibly, in his daily excur|&s;ions, &s;ee many women whom he thinks hand&s;omer than his wife; but it is generally her fault if he meet with one that he thinks more amiable. A de&s;ire of plea&s;ing very rarely fails of its effect; but in a wife, that de&s;ire mu&s;t be managed with the nice&s;t delicacy; it &s;hould appear rather in the re&s;ult, than in the
<PB N="26" REF="35">
de&s;ign; <Q REND="inline">"not obvious, not ob|tru&s;ive."</Q> The&s;e <HI>petits &s;oins</HI> are the be&s;t &s;upplement to our great duties, and render the commerce of life delightful. Like an elegant de&s;|&s;ert, they complete the fea&s;t, and leave not a wi&s;h un&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>WE have hitherto looked only on the plea&s;ing &s;ide of the tape&s;try, and &s;een Marriage in its mo&s;t fa|vourable light. Let us now turn the canvas, and take a view of its defects.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e, then, what I think the wor&s;t of all &s;ituations,
<PB N="27" REF="36">
an amiable young woman po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing the tendere&s;t affection for her hu&s;band, while he, from the natural depravity and incon&s;tancy of his nature, has withdrawn his love from her, and perhaps be&s;towed it on &s;ome unworthy object, to whom he devotes his time and fortune.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a &s;tate of wretchedne&s;s what line &s;hall our neglected wife pur&s;ue? The fir&s;t &s;tep that I would recommend to her, is, that of en|tering into a &s;erious, &s;trict, and im|partial review of her own conduct, even to the minutiae of her dre&s;s,
<PB N="28" REF="37">
and the expre&s;&s;ions of her looks, from the fir&s;t of her acquaintance of her hu&s;band. If, after &s;uch exami|nation, &s;he cannot di&s;cover any fault in her manners that might have given offence, or created di&s;gu&s;t, let her &s;teadily pur&s;ue the &s;ame behaviour &s;he has hitherto prac|ti&s;ed; for, if that be totally free from error, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any alteration can give an additional efficacy to it. For to re&s;ent, or to retaliate, neither her duty, nor her religion will permit.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="38"><Q REND="inline">"To carry &s;miles upon the face, when di&s;contentent &s;its brooding at the heart,"</Q> is, I confe&s;s, one of the mo&s;t difficult ta&s;ks that can po&s;&s;ibly be impo&s;ed on an ingenuous and feel|ing &s;oul. But a thorough convic|tion that it is her province to en|deavour to recal the wanderer back, for his own happine&s;s, as well as her's, and a certainty that there are no other means of accompli&s;hing &s;o de&s;irable an end, will enable her to pur&s;ue this arduous undertaking, till either her heart &s;hall rejoice in its &s;ucce&s;s, or from reiterated di&s;ap|pointments become indifferent to
<PB N="30" REF="39">
the worthle&s;s object of its former e&s;teem and attention.</P>
<P>GRANTING the la&s;t to be the ca&s;e, &s;he has a right to expect the good opinion of the world will at|tend her conduct: but an higher and more certain reward awaits it; &s;elf-approbation, ari&s;ing from a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having fulfilled her duty, and an a&s;&s;urance of having e&s;&s;ayed the only method that was likely to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s: for never yet was love recalled by lamenta|tions or upbraidings. The fir&s;t may &s;ometimes, perhaps, create
<PB N="31" REF="40">
pity, but oftener begets contempt; and the latter never did, nor can produce any pa&s;&s;ion but in&s;tant rage, or cool determined hate.</P>
<P>RECOLLECTION may furni&s;h to my fair Readers many in&s;tances where patient &s;ufferings have been rewarded with returning love; but I think there is &s;carcely one to be met with, where female violence has ever conquered male outrage; or where di&s;&s;ipation and coquetry, though they may have alarmed the pride, ever reclaimed the alien|ated affections of a hu&s;band.</P>

<P>MONTAIGNE, among&s;t the Mo|derns, &s;eems to have felt a &s;tronger emanation of this virtue, than any Author I am acquainted with; and tho' the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of his warm

imagination gives us but a faint ray of its ancient lu&s;tre, yet even this &s;light re&s;emblance appears too &s;trong for our weak eyes, and &s;eems rather to dazzle than attract our regards.</P>
<P>OUR cotemporary, Dr. YOUNG, has left us &s;everal very beautiful de&s;criptions of Friend&s;hip, which, though deficient of that fire which not only blazed but burned in this ancient virtue, are, however, &s;uf|ficient to form both our theory and our practice upon.
<Q><L>" True Friend&s;hip warms, it rai&s;es, it tran&s;ports,</L>
<L><PB N="74" REF="83">" Like mu&s;ic pure the joy, without allay,</L>
<L>" Who&s;e very rapture is tranquillity."</L></Q>
This is a very plea&s;ing and ju&s;t de|&s;cription of Friend&s;hip in the ab|&s;tract; but it wants that energy which particular attachments add to all our &s;entiments, and without which, like a winter's &s;un, they &s;hine, but do not warm.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Author has given us a more intere&s;ting, tho', perhaps, le&s;s elevated idea of this affection of the mind, in his addre&s;s to a particular per&s;on:
<Q><L>" Lorenzo, pride &s;uppre&s;s, nor hope to find</L>
<L>" A Friend, but what has found a Friend in thee."</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="84">THIS is a new, and I think a ju&s;t, light in which we may con&s;ider this &s;entiment; for though love may be formed without &s;ympathy, Friend&s;hip never can. It is, even in its degenerate &s;tate, an affection that cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in vicious minds; and among the mo&s;t virtuous, it requires a parity of &s;entiment, manners, and rank, for its ba&s;is. Of all the nice ties and dependen|cies which con&s;titute the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of life, it is the mo&s;t de|licate, and even the mo&s;t fragile. Wealth cannot purcha&s;e, nor gifts en&s;ure, its permanence.

The Great, alas! rarely enjoy this ble&s;&s;ing; vanity and emulation prevent its growth among equals; and the humiliating conde&s;cen&s;ion with which &s;uperiors &s;ometimes deign to affect Friend&s;hip for their inferiors, &s;trikes at the very foun|dation of the &s;entiment; from which there can only ari&s;e a tot|tering &s;uper&s;tructure, who&s;e pillars, like tho&s;e of modern compo&s;ition, bear the glo&s;s, but want the durable

quality of the mental marble, &s;in|cerity. Yet there have been in|&s;tances, though rare, of real Friend|&s;hip between per&s;ons of different ranks in life, particularly Henry the Fourth and Sully; but the virtues of the latter placed him on a level with Monarchs, and the magnanimity of the former made him &s;en&s;ible of their equality.</P>
<P>YET how often are complaints uttered by di&s;appointed pride, again&s;t the ingratitude of tho&s;e whom they have <HI>honoured</HI> with the title of Friend, nay, and have even
<PB N="78" REF="87">
&s;erved and obliged as &s;uch; without reflecting that obligations to a ge|nerous mind are in&s;ults, when ac|companied with the lea&s;t &s;light or mortification.</P>
<P>ON the other hand we, perhaps, too willingly attach our&s;elves to our &s;uperiors. Our &s;elf-love is flattered by their approbation, as it naturally imagines it can only be for our good and amiable qua|lities that they like or di&s;tingui&s;h us. But tho'
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"love, like death, makes all di&s;tinction void,"</Q>
Friend|&s;hip has no &s;uch levelling power.

Superiority of rank or fortune is generally felt by the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es either; and they are en|titled to &s;ome degree of prai&s;e, if they do not make others feel it al&s;o.</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e, then, who have de|licate minds, remember that equa|lity is the true ba&s;is of Friend&s;hip; let them &s;et a ju&s;t value on their own worth, as well as on the inebri|ating &s;miles of greatne&s;s, and not expo&s;e their &s;en&s;ibility to the pangs it mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain, on di&s;covering that neither virtues or talents can al|ways

<P>THUS far my remarks upon this &s;ubject are general. Let me now apply them to their u&s;e for whom this little work is peculiarly de|&s;igned, by earne&s;tly recommending it to every young married woman to &s;eek the friend of her heart in the hu&s;band of her affection. There, and there only, is that true equali|ty, both of rank and fortune, &s;trengthened by mutual intere&s;ts
<PB N="81" REF="90">
and cemented by mutual pledges, to be found. There only conde|&s;cen&s;ions will not mortify, as they will be conce&s;&s;ions but of kindne&s;s, not of pride. There, and there only, will &s;he be &s;ure to meet with reciprocal confidence, unfeigned attachment, and tender &s;olicitude, to &s;oothe her every care. The ties of wedded love will be rivetted by the bands of Friend&s;hip; the virtues of her mind, when called &s;orth by occa&s;ion, will unfold them&s;elves by degrees to her hu&s;bands per|ception, like the opening ro&s;e be|fore the morning ray; and when

<P>AS the word Friend&s;hip is at pre&s;ent generally under&s;tood to be a term of little import, or at mo&s;t that extends merely to a preference of liking, or e&s;teem; I would by no means exclude my fair Readers from that kind of commerce which is now accepted under that

title, in &s;ociety. But even this &s;ort of connection requires much caution in the choice of its object; for I &s;hould wi&s;h it might be re|&s;trained to one; and that one ought to obtain this preference, from the qualities of the heart rather than tho&s;e of the head. A long and intimate acquaintance can alone di&s;cover the former; the latter are ea&s;ily and willingly di&s;played; for love without e&s;teem is as a <HI>&s;hower,</HI> &s;oon &s;pent.

<P><PB N="84" REF="93">FOR this rea&s;on, it always ap|pears to me a proof of mutual me|rit, when two &s;i&s;ters, or two young women, who have been brought up together, are &s;trongly attached to each other; and I will admit, that while they remain unmarried, &s;uch a connection is capable of forming a pure and di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip, provided that the &s;ym|pathy of their affections does not tend to make them like or admire the &s;ame male object; for though Love may, Friend&s;hip cannot exi&s;t with jealou&s;y.<Q><L>" Re&s;erve will wound it, and di&s;tru&s;t de&s;troy."</L></Q></P>

<P>THE minds of mo&s;t young wo|men &s;eem, and indeed ought to do &s;o in reality, to acquire a new bent after marriage: &s;cenes different from tho&s;e to which they had been accu&s;tomed, open to their view; different objects engro&s;s their at|tention; every &s;tate has its cares; and, from the queen to the pea&s;ant, every wife has duties to fulfil.

be, renounced, for the more plea|&s;ing and re&s;pectable avocations of an affectionate Wife, a tender Mo|ther, and a beloved and honoured Matron of a family.</P>
<P>I HOPE it is impo&s;&s;ible that I &s;hould be &s;o far mi&s;under&s;tood, as to be thought to exclude married women from any innocent plea&s;ure or rational amu&s;ement that is &s;uited to their age, rank, or fortune.

But &s;till there is, or &s;hould be, a difference in the enjoyment of their plea&s;ures; between the thoughtle&s;s gaiety of girls, and the decent chearfulne&s;s of married women.

<P>I MAY be thought to have &s;ome|what wandered from the particular &s;ubject of this chapter, though, I hope, not from the general ob|ject of the work. I &s;hall now con|clude
<PB N="91" REF="100">
with ob&s;erving, that as the characters and conduct of even her common acquaintance reflect ho|nour or di&s;grace upon a young married woman, &s;he will be an ine|vitable &s;harer in that degree of re&s;pect or contempt which her <HI>cho&s;en</HI> friend po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the e&s;teem of the world: and though its cen&s;ures may &s;ometimes involve the innocent with the guilty; yet, in general, there is no fairer way of forming our opinions of per&s;ons we do not know, than from their intimate a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="101">THERE is &s;omething &s;till more alarming to be dreaded for a young woman who is thoughtle&s;s enough to form indi&s;criminate friend&s;hips.

The ro&s;y blu&s;h that gives the intuitive alarm to decency, even before the perceptions of the mind are awake to danger, glows not upon their cheek; the &s;nowy purity of inno|cence beams not upon their daunt|le&s;s

<P>AN intimacy with &s;uch per&s;ons is, of all others, the mo&s;t danger|ous. The frankne&s;s and liveline&s;s of their conver&s;ation render them too generally agreeable, and they frequently undermine the prin|ciples of virtue, before we find it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tand upon our guard.</P>

<PB N="99" REF="108">
this failure appears in per&s;ons of otherwi&s;e good and amiable di&s;|po&s;itions, I am inclined to believe that there mu&s;t have been &s;omething peculiarly wrong in the bias of their education, or the conduct of their parents towards them; for in a &s;tate of infancy every child mu&s;t naturally love its parents; they are the fir&s;t objects which awaken in us the ideas of power and kindne&s;s; of a power that enables, and a kindne&s;s that prompts, to &s;upply all our little wants, and to &s;oothe and alleviate all our pains and di|&s;tre&s;&s;es.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and knoweth whereof we are made,"</Q>
has thought proper to command the exertion of this virtue in its fulle&s;t extent, by the emphatic term of <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</HI> and has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to add the promi&s;e of length of days to tho&s;e who fulfil this law.</P>
<P>WHEN the ties of natural af|fection are thus enforced by the Divine &s;anction, it appears almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that any ca&s;ualty &s;hould di&s;&s;olve this double band, or that

<P>THE union which is formed by wedded love, can never &s;lacken or abate its &s;trength; for in liberal minds the encrea&s;e of happine&s;s, like the &s;un's beams upon a fertile &s;oil, calls every virtue forth; the tender <HI>charities</HI> which gladden life are ripened and matured beneath its influence; while the flowers of connubial fondne&s;s bloom faire&s;t, and are &s;weete&s;t to the &s;en&s;e, when they grow on the rich &s;tem of filial love: and a hu&s;band mu&s;t

for their kindne&s;s, combined with the tender apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing them, add &s;trength to our former affectionate feelings, and awaken that almo&s;t divine enthu|&s;ia&s;m which in&s;pired Pope's filial prayer:

<P>THERE is an oeconomy of time, too, as well as of fortune, which I would earne&s;tly recommend. A little attention to this very im|portant article would &s;erve to lighten that &s;ad load of which we oft complain, while yet with childi&s;h fondne&s;s we lament its

<P><PB N="115" REF="124">ACTION is the great &s;pring on which Creation turns; it is that pre&s;erves and harmonizes all. Even things inanimate, trees, plants, and flowers, obey the voice of Nature, and act in their own &s;phere. Un|bidden they &s;end forth their fruits and odours, and pay their tribute to Creation's laws. The elements them|&s;elves &s;ub&s;i&s;t by motion. Without its actuating &s;pirit the earth no more could turn upon its axis; the fire would be extinct, and air and water &s;tagnate to putrefaction.

<P>NO rea&s;oning being can doubt, but that the u&s;e or abu&s;e of time

<P>BUT for a moment let us admit that con&s;cience could be lulled to re&s;t on beds of ro&s;es, or that the wa&s;te of time might not be deemed a vice; is there on earth a human being &s;o lo&s;t to every &s;en&s;e of its own dignity as to acquie&s;ce in bare exi&s;tence, and to look back upon the &s;um of that exi&s;tence as a blank?

to me &s;o fully &s;ufficient to awaken that noble pride, that true &s;elf-e&s;timation which Heaven has im|planted in our &s;ouls, for the great purpo&s;e of exalting our nature above the &s;ubordinate cla&s;&s;es of animals, who are debarred the glo|rious prerogative of looking for|ward with humble hope to an happy immortality, that I &s;hould think any other incitement would be &s;uperfluous upon this &s;ubject; which I &s;hall therefore conclude with the intere&s;ting picture which the la&s;t Author quoted above has given, of tho&s;e happy few who

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have now, though perhaps but faintly, touched upon the duties mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential in the marriage-&s;tate, it appears to me unnece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue this work any farther; though I am certain there are many follies, not to give them a har&s;her name, incident to my &s;ex, which are not even glanced at in the&s;e E&s;&s;ays. The mo&s;t glar|ing, perhaps, that has been left unnoticed, is the univer&s;al &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation which &s;eems to reign among all ranks of women. But

though I have not particularly at|tacked this Arch-demon, this greate&s;t enemy to dome&s;tic hap|pine&s;s, I hope I have in &s;ome de|gree undermined his batteries, and &s;apped his intrenchments in the female heart. At lea&s;t, I have of|fered to tho&s;e who chu&s;e to accept them, the powerful auxiliaries of Religion, Conjugal Affection, and Parental Love, to oppo&s;e his force, and render them &s;uperior to his allurements; for tho&s;e who &s;erve under the banner of the&s;e mild Virtues, will never fall a prey to the tyrannic power of Vice, how|ever

it may be &s;upported by cu&s;|tom, or adorned by the &s;eductive arts of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e E&s;&s;ays are meant to be <HI>generally</HI> u&s;eful, it would be impo&s;|&s;ible to confine their precepts to any particular rank or &s;ituation; of cour&s;e there can be no rules laid down for the conduct of in|dividuals under any peculiar cir|cum&s;tances: and indeed the whole Work may rather be con&s;idered as a &s;ketch, from which the intelli|gent mind may deduce inferences and make applications, than as a
<PB N="123" REF="132">
regular plan to be diligently pur|&s;ued.</P>
<P>UNCANDID and unfavourable as the pre&s;enttimes may be deemed to moral literature, and unequal as I may be thought to &s;o arduous a &s;ubject as that I have undertaken, I &s;till pre&s;ume to hope there is no Critic &s;o &s;evere as to deny me the merit of meaning well, though I may have fallen infinitely &s;hort of the real motive that prompted this publication; which is, to re&s;tore my fair Countrywomen to that pre|eminence they formerly held over

the re&s;t of their &s;ex through the known world, and to bring back that glorious aera when the Epitaph of the LUCAS family characteri&s;ed the whole Briti&s;h Nation:
<Q><L>" All the Brothers were valiant,</L>
<L>" And all the Si&s;ters virtuous."</L></Q></P>
<P>I HAVE humbly pre&s;umed to lay this little Work at the feet of our mo&s;t amiable and gracious QUEEN, who&s;e private virtues, as a Wife and Mother, add lu&s;tre to her exalted rank, and would adorn the Throne of Univer&s;al Monarchy.</P>
