<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF NORFOLK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD DUKE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO a patron of the Mu&s;es this would indeed be an intru&s;ive and contemptible offering, as I cannot claim even the mo&s;t di&s;tant relation&s;hip with the Si&s;ter Arts; and if I were to a&s;&s;ume only a familiar and ea&s;y acquaintance, I &s;hould be in|&s;tantly detected as a &s;illy, though <HI>not</HI> an <HI>artful</HI> impo&s;tor: I mu&s;t therefore &s;lide imperceptibly into your Grace's pre&s;ence, under the fallacious and &s;pecious pretext of being a dangling twig-cou&s;in of the alluring theatres, to which your Grace is a well-known avowed friend, <HI>amateur,</HI> and protector; as they evidently are honoured with your Grace's never-failing tribute and &s;upport:&mdash;Therefore, under the guardian &s;hades of Melpo|mene and Thalia, I am emboldened <HI>(by Hope)</HI> to ca&s;t my defencele&s;s work at your Grace's feet, imploring mercy and pity for my lack of &s;kill and non-acquaintance with the Mu&s;es. The work, indeed, is a true picture of its ma&s;ter, being as de|&s;titute of wit as wealth:&mdash;The concurring evils of
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
its poverty, and want of natural brilliant endow|ments, preclude, I fear, every po&s;&s;ible chance of good fortune for pre&s;erving its life with the world's approbation, unle&s;s when they behold with won|der your Grace's conde&s;cen&s;ion in rai&s;ing the &s;up|plicating mendicant from the ground, and crown|ing its in&s;ignificance with your good wi&s;hes, which mu&s;t be ever regarded as an honoured and gra|cious fo&s;tering. And who knows, by being thus adorned with the Duke of Norfolk's name in its front, but it may make &s;o brilliant an appearance as to obtain a pa&s;&s;port into the pre&s;ence of the mo&s;t noble and worthy, and by &s;uch unmerited good fortune, its &s;ickly life may not only be pre|&s;erved from in&s;tant peri&s;hing, but prolonged even after its in&s;ignificant parent &s;hall inevitably be obliterated from the &s;malle&s;t traces of memory; as your Grace's goodne&s;s, wit, and under&s;tand|ing, will live for ages, and perhaps occa&s;ionally be the means of re&s;toring a faint gli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mering (in theatrical dark pa&s;&s;ages) of him who, during his life, has ever been with true gratitude and re&s;pect|ful homage,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GOOD READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BE kind, courteous, merciful, and forgiving; for how would you be, if <HI>HE,</HI> who is the top of judgment, &s;hould but judge you as you are? Oh! think on that, and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made.</P>
<P>This confu&s;ed, motley, incoherent medley&mdash;this &s;omething, or this nothing of a work, was un|dertaken without any premeditation or note what|ever, and fini&s;hed heedle&s;sly, during a &s;evere, pain|ful, and tedious illne&s;s, occa&s;ioned by a dreadful fractured leg&mdash;the time greatly interfered upon with the con&s;tant and unavoidable vexations, di&s;|appointments, and accidents, that will ever be the natural attendants on the conductor of a theatre; as the difficulty of plea&s;ing before and behind the curtain <HI>requires, at lea&s;t,</HI> no <HI>common &s;hare</HI> of <HI>wit:</HI> but as I was unable to move, and was ever ad|dicted to the witching time of night, it helped to alleviate many di&s;tre&s;&s;ed hours.</P>
<P>As to wit I profe&s;s it not, yet here and there it will &s;tart unexpectedly, as the quotations are &s;o variou&s;ly &s;prinkled, and either witne&s;s for or again&s;t me; but
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
I may &s;urely be permitted to quote, as the able&s;t and mo&s;t ingenious men do the &s;ame (no matter how elevated in rank and &s;tation) and are frequently heard by the Lords and Commons, and even at the learned bar on the mo&s;t &s;erious occa&s;ions; nei|ther is the holy pulpit entirely exempt from this practice. The e&s;teemed Samuel Whyte, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of Dublin, remarks, that <Q REND="inline">"every cla&s;s of life has its pedants; tho&s;e of a theatrical turn &s;hew their pre|dilection in their u&s;e of theatrical allu&s;ions and ci|tations from plays on every occa&s;ion, happily ex|emplified in the character of the Apprentice; here the writer takes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eave, once for all, to acknow|ledge, that he has &s;tudiou&s;ly imitated the turn of expre&s;&s;ion, and adopted a favourite phra&s;e from any pa&s;&s;age alluded to in other writers, without particularizing it by any mark or intimation, deeming it &s;uperfluous to the learned reader, who needs no monitor to recogni&s;e an old acquaint|ance, and may be plea&s;ed to meet it in a novel and unexpected &s;ituation: To the le&s;s learned it would be empty parade, and disfigure the page to no end. Our mo&s;t eminent poets have freely in|dulged them&s;elves in this practice;&mdash;Pope e&s;pe|cially;&mdash;but as he re&s;orted to the ancients, and works not commonly known it has not been ge|nerally noticed; and by mo&s;t who have ob&s;erved it, e&s;teemed a beauty."</Q> As a &s;tage chronologer, I

flatter my&s;elf this work (be&s;ides its authenticity) po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;tage materials, and many whim&s;ical &s;itu|tions, that, in the hands of a Mr. Mu p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y, might have been &s;o plea&s;ingly dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, as to have &s;u&s;tain|ed the being viewed and examined: But I fear, like Bayes, I have a kna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">k of making my&s;elf not under&s;tood.&mdash;I mean it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> a kind of regi&s;ter for all per&s;ons attached to the theatres, and who wi&s;h for information relative to the London and Dub|lin &s;tages: It may r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">eve an heavy hour on a rainy day; and to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">atrical pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ors I think I may recommend it, as containing as impartial and true an account of the progre&s;s of the principal events of playhou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">es as any book I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an recollect on the &s;ubje<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t; and at the &s;ame time truly lament its thou&s;and deficiencies, and improprieties, which, I am &s;en&s;ible, will be in&s;uperab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e bars to its pro|&s;perity.</P>
<P>However, I wrap my&s;elf in one idea, which is, I think it will not, cannot be, on examination, more indifferently and contemptuou&s;ly e&s;timated, than all my frien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ven my foes combined, (I dare &s;up|po&s;e) expect it to be; and I as freely declare, on the peru&s;al, it is better, with all its prolixity, than I ever expected it would or could be. But I mu&s;t in its be|half reque&s;t my readers to ob&s;erve, as a &s;trict truth, that the printers, to their ince&s;&s;ant fatigue, can te&s;tify, there never has been <HI>one regular</HI> &s;heet, <HI>or</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="8">
<HI>a legible</HI> one; and, though a &s;trange a&s;&s;ertion, it is <HI>incontrovertibly true:</HI> the incorrectne&s;s of what I had <HI>&s;cratched</HI> down <HI>from one corner to the other,</HI> was not intelligible even to my&s;elf the day fol|lowing, and therefore it was next to impo&s;&s;ible to properly divine the meaning; con&s;equently many pa&s;&s;ages and words have been mi&s;con&s;trued, and unavoidably retained and printed; and hence &s;e|veral of my <HI>wi&s;e</HI> ob&s;ervations and informations, from <HI>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> have been entirely oblite|rated, or not properly in&s;erted; frequently from my own &s;pla&s;hings and alterations, as I &s;o bewil|dered the printers, that they declared it incompre|hen&s;ible and impo&s;&s;ible to proceed;&mdash;that they never had &s;uch a job in their lives, and heartily prayed they never might have &s;uch another.&mdash;However, the pre&s;s, after groaning, has produced to light the mi&s;hapen deformity. Indeed it may with propriety be ob&s;erved as matter of &s;urpri&s;e, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, that my truly good friend, (in the ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word) Mr. WILSON, has accompli&s;hed a work in ten months, in &s;pight of the &s;everal in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles, and &s;triking impediments, which ob&s;tructed its ever gliding &s;moothly into the road of either credit or fame. All this con&s;idered will ea&s;ily gain kind allowance why its delay need not be wondered at, and my lamene&s;s apologize for tardy &s;teps; for

when I <HI>fir&s;t</HI> printed the propo&s;als, I had at that time only begun the toil&s;ome ta&s;k I had &s;et my|&s;elf; and though <HI>brevity</HI> is the fir&s;t word, I fear <HI>tautology</HI> would with ju&s;tice &s;eize the elder&s;hip and right<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tablet being an after-thought, rendered &s;ome re|petition requi&s;ite, and &s;everal anecdotes are omitted there, as a reference to the fir&s;t and &s;econd volumes will &s;upply many deficiencies.&mdash;The reader will allow for the different dates I have mentioned when writing, and not allude to the year of peru&s;al.

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF TATE WILKINSON.</HEAD>
<P>BREVITY is the &s;oul of WIT.&mdash;I am &s;orry for my own &s;ake, as well as for tho&s;e who have the patience and good nature to peru&s;e this motley work, to ob&s;erve, that it will be dreadfully deficient in both the&s;e material articles.&mdash;However, that the reader may not be kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and then com|plain that the <HI>mountain,</HI> after a <HI>tedious labour,</HI> has at length <HI>brought forth only a mou&s;e,</HI> I will, without further ceremony, proceed.</P>
<P>I, <HI>Tate Wilkin&s;on,</HI> who&s;e various &s;tage adven|tures and <HI>&s;parrings</HI> have been permitted, and fa|voured with acceptance, more or le&s;s, in almo&s;t every principal theatre in the three kingdoms, as Drury-Lane, Covent-Garden, Hay-Market,&mdash;Smock-Alley and Crow-Street, Dublin,&mdash;Bath, Edinburgh, Port&s;mouth, Winche&s;ter, Maid&s;tone,

Birmingham, Che&s;ter, Bri&s;tol, Norwich, York, Shrew&s;bury, Richmond in Surry, Exeter, Gla&s;|gow, Newca&s;tle, Leeds, Lynn, Pontefract, Hali|fax, Donca&s;ter, Hull, Wakefield, &amp;c.&mdash;am the &s;on of the late Rev. Dr. John Wilkin&s;on, who was educated at St. Bees in Cumberland, and fini&s;hed his &s;tudies at the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and who &s;uffer|ed tran&s;portation under the well remembered Mar|riage Act in 1755. He was his Maje&s;ty's chaplain of the Savoy, al&s;o chaplain to his late Royal High|ne&s;s Frederic Prince of Wales, rector of Coyty in the county of Glamorgan, and &s;tipendary-curate of Wi&s;e in the county of Kent.&mdash;The late Lord Galway, with whom he was particularly acquaint|ed, pre&s;ented him with a gift, which yielded a right to open plai&s;ter-pits in the honour of Pontefract: The original grant was to Robert Monkton, late of Hoderoyde, in the county of York, father to the afore&s;aid Lord Galway: The right from the Duchy-office was in 1740.&mdash;Tho&s;e plai&s;ter-pits were &s;old to a Mr. Jenkin&s;on, near Ferrybridge; but how they turned out it never lay in my way to get information.&mdash;Grace Wilkin&s;on, his wife, was daughter of William Tate, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who was for many years one of the aldermen of the city of Carli&s;le, and often cho&s;en mayor of that ancient corporation; for above forty years patent &s;earcher of his Maje&s;ty's cu&s;toms there and at the port of
<PB N="3" REF="25">
Whitehaven&mdash;a gentleman of undoubted loyalty. The &s;aid Grace Wilkin&s;on, when &s;he intermarried with the Rev. John Wilkin&s;on, brought him two thou&s;and pounds, at that time judged a very gen|teel fortune.&mdash;Dr. Wilkin&s;on's affairs having been for many years greatly embarra&s;&s;ed, not only hers, but all his own acqui&s;itions were entirely exhau&s;ted to &s;atisfy the demands of his own cre|ditors, and tho&s;e of others, for whom he had be|come indi&s;creetly engaged.</P>
<P>I, Tate Wilkin&s;on, (&s;on to the &s;aid John and Grace) was born October 27, 1739; and, by my father's &s;entence of tran&s;portation, was likely to have been irretrievably ruined. I was at that cri|tical period at the age of &s;eventeen&mdash;not brought up to any bu&s;ine&s;s or profe&s;&s;ion&mdash;of a very indif|ferent con&s;titution&mdash;and neither mother nor &s;on had the lea&s;t independency.</P>
<P>Previous to this unfortunate event, my father and mother had been connected with the mo&s;t leading families, and were univer&s;ally acquainted in London; the con&s;equence (mo&s;t fortunately for my&s;elf, as will appear hereafter,) was, that from the intercour&s;e of vi&s;iting they formed intimate connexions with &s;everal leading per&s;ons of the kingdom of Ireland, which was the foundation of the happie&s;t future con&s;equences to me, as will, in the narrative, be verified.&mdash;Several of the&s;e fa|milies
<PB N="4" REF="26">
every year re&s;orted to London, where they ever found ho&s;pitality, and a cheerful welcome, at our man&s;ion in the Savoy.&mdash;Among&s;t our various vi&s;itors were Lord and Lady Forbes, from the &s;i&s;ter kingdom. They were &s;o attached to my father and mother, as to be almo&s;t in&s;eparable: That intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on &s;o &s;trong a ba&s;is, and formed &s;o firm a friend&s;hip, that they u&s;ed to call me their <HI>own boy Tate,</HI> and their <HI>dear George's only particular friend.</HI> They promi&s;ed to fix me genteelly in life; and were certain, if George lived to be Earl of Granard, <HI>Tate</HI> would be well provided for.&mdash;Airy ca&s;tles too often gain belief and dependence, when of a &s;udden they di&s;appear, and wake the deluded dreamer from his tran&s;itory vi&s;ion, and in lieu pre&s;ent a true mirror, in which he views his actual &s;tate.&mdash;Not that I mean the&s;e promi&s;es in all probability would not have been performed, but the wheel of Fate is &s;o un|certain, perplexing, and various, as evinces the truth of Shak&s;peare,&mdash;<HI>We all know what we are; but know not what we may be.</HI></P>
<P>This intimacy with the Forbes' family was carried on more like a modern novel than a com|mon acquaintance. Young George Forbes was born April 2, 1740:&mdash;I was not permitted to wear breeches until the &s;ame day appointed for George, the 2d of April, 1745. Lady Forbes,
<PB N="5" REF="27">
notwith&s;tanding title and great expectations in life, was not without many of her days being embit|tered:&mdash;Her heart and mind were &s;oftened by the too often experiencing humiliating events, di&s;ap|pointments, and afflictions. She was related to Lord Ble&s;&s;ington and Lady Tyrawley, and was niece to Lady Granard, and bred up under her care. Her elde&s;t &s;on, young Lord Forbes, as he ripened into manhood, by frequent intercour&s;e with his lovely relation, &s;oon became a willing &s;lave to the irre&s;i&s;tible qualities of his captivating cou&s;in: She gave him grace for grace, and love for love, yielded to his entreaties, and they were privately married&mdash;<Q><L>&mdash;The maid that loves</L>
<L>Goes out to &s;ea upon a &s;hatter'd plank,</L>
<L>And puts her tru&s;t in miracles for &s;afety,</L></Q> tru&s;ting, as many young couples do, when the irre|vocable knot was tied, that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and in|treaty, with a promi&s;e of forgivene&s;s,&mdash;<HI>This once, and I will do &s;o no more:</HI> But age, on the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, is either &s;oon &s;oftened, or, like the ever|la&s;ting flint, is hard and obdurate; and, in that in&s;tance, was &s;o to &s;uch a degree, as rendered &s;upplication, tears, and remon&s;trance, only incen|tives to increa&s;e in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening the vengeance denounced.&mdash;That &s;teeled character, on that occa|&s;ion, was exemplified in the &s;evere&s;t degree, and
<PB N="6" REF="28">
executed with a Roman &s;trictne&s;s&mdash;For the Earl of Granard not only bani&s;hed his &s;on, Lord Forbes, from his pre&s;ence for ever, but, on the cruel &s;uppo&s;ition that Lady Granard had con|nived at the match, he, in the mo&s;t &s;tern and &s;udden manner, &s;eparated him&s;elf from her La|dy&s;hip, and never after &s;aw or &s;poke to her; all m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">diation of families, no matter of what rank, were vain:&mdash;In this he was fixed, and acted as re|&s;olutely as our &s;tage Count of Narbonne.</P>
<P>Lady Granard, to prove her di&s;approbation of the match, and to regain the affections of her Lord, in&s;tead of con&s;olation and comfort to her niece, Lady Forbes, in her then calamitous &s;itu|ation, vowed never to behold her more; and in this determination &s;he was as re&s;olute as a Ro|man matron, and proved &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as &s;teeled a mind as her inexorable Lord.&mdash;In one point only the female brea&s;t gave way to natural feeling:&mdash;Young George &s;he &s;aw, cheri&s;hed, and adored; and often had him, while young, at her hou&s;e in Argyle Buildings, near Soho-&s;quare:&mdash;But the grandfather never yielded to the ties of affinity;&mdash;he lived chiefly retired, at his own &s;eat of Ca&s;tle Forbes in Ireland.</P>
<P>Lord Forbes was generally with his regiment at Gibraltar, or with the regiment on its return to Ireland:&mdash;He had a hou&s;e in Stephen's-Green,
<PB N="7" REF="29">
Dublin, and occa&s;ionally made a &s;ecret excur&s;ion to England to vi&s;it his wife and &s;on, who chiefly re&s;ided at her hou&s;e in Richmond Buildings, Dean-&s;treet, Soho. The &s;on was, at or before &s;even years old, put to a Mr. Black's boarding|&s;chool at Chi&s;wick, where I was often taken as a vi&s;itor.&mdash;When turned of eleven, her Lady&s;hip and &s;on received orders to repair to Dublin: On this occa&s;ion her Lady&s;hip took with her a carpet for her drawing-room, e&s;teemed beautiful, the work of my mother, and I dare &s;ay it is in the fa|mily to this day, with &s;everal elegant worked &s;kreens, in tent &s;titch, executed by the &s;ame good ingenious hand.</P>
<P>About the age of thirteen he was brought back to England to fini&s;h his education, and then to be placed in his Maje&s;ty's Guards. Our meeting, on his arrival in England, as may be imagined, was very joyous; he was placed under the care of a Mr. Gib&s;on, a rigid Scotchman, al&s;o under the eye of his uncle Admiral Forbes. He was &s;oon &s;ent to Harrow-&s;chool; I was eager to follow him, and in another year that wi&s;h was accompli&s;hed; of which a particular account will occur in the Theatrical Hi&s;tory, and it will claim a &s;hort attention.</P>
<P>But of the young hero I am now &s;peaking, when about &s;ixteen he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Maje&s;ty's colours, and often on guard at the
<PB N="8" REF="30">
Savoy; he grew very di&s;&s;ipated, while under the direction of a Mr. Durel, (when not on duty) at his academy in King's-&s;treet, Golden-&s;quare; but as he could not be kept within bounds, Lady Forbes, from the accounts tran&s;mitted to Ireland, being greatly alarmed, and fearful he &s;hould incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of his father, intreated his Lord|&s;hip to grant her, the in&s;pection and guardian&s;hip of her &s;on in London, till he grew nearer a proper time of life to be tru&s;ted to the care of him&s;elf; this point was &s;ettled, and an hou&s;e once more taken in the old &s;pot, Richmond Buildings.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t all &s;eemed to promi&s;e fair, and a Mrs. Wil&s;on, who had for many years been companion to Lady Forbes, (a &s;i&s;ter of Mrs. Kelly, wife of hone&s;t old Cornelius Kelly, now living in Dub|lin,) was the per&s;on appointed to hint any private di&s;plea&s;ure to our young Captain. The fond mo|ther &s;eemed intoxicated with the pro&s;pect of hap|pine&s;s before her delighted imagination; but of a &s;udden, on the non-appearance of George for a few days, &s;he experienced the mo&s;t alarming anxiety, which, after fruitle&s;s enquiries, was at la&s;t cleared up by a young couple from Gretna Green im|ploring her ble&s;&s;ing. Her fortitude for&s;ook her, and her exclamations of grief, &s;urpri&s;e, and terror, for the con&s;equences with Lord Forbes, and the dread of every horrid indignation from the old
<PB N="9" REF="31">
Earl, overwhelmed her with the mo&s;t poignant di&s;tre&s;s; for &s;he well fore&s;aw that every ill that fa|tally occurred, would be attributed to her needle&s;s a&s;&s;umption of re&s;iding in London&mdash;and, in&s;tead of preventing, would be accu&s;ed of encouraging her &s;on in every fal&s;e &s;tep. Nor had &s;he pre&s;ence of mind, nor fortitude &s;ufficient at the fir&s;t &s;hock, to enquire who this daughter was; but as &s;oon as Rea&s;on could re&s;ume its &s;eat, dreading an increa&s;|ing tale of woe, yet obliged to require information; which being truly given, mitigated her unea&s;ine&s;s, and was mo&s;t happily relieved on being plea&s;ingly informed he had married a daughter of Sir Nicholas Baily, tho' her expectations of fortune, on enquiring, were but &s;mall: She proved a young lady of promi&s;e, fit to adorn any exalted &s;tation in life. Matters were ill received in Ireland; but by degrees his Lord|&s;hip became better reconciled than could be ex|pected.&mdash;By this amiable young lady, the family were ble&s;&s;ed with the pre&s;ent Earl of Granard, now in Dublin, 1789, but &s;he &s;oon after fell into a decay, and, like a lily drooping, died. It was during this part of their hi&s;tory the reader will &s;uppo&s;e, when I hereafter &s;peak of Lady Forbes, (that young gentleman's mother) that I received &s;uch favours when fir&s;t acting in London.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of that amiable young lady, the Earl of Granard died, but not before
<PB N="10" REF="32">
he was reconciled at the la&s;t to his &s;on and grand|&s;on, then become Lord Forbes, and his father of cour&s;e the Earl of Granard. The young Lord married a lady of quality in London: Soon after his &s;econd marriage he became Earl of Granard, but from modern fa&s;hions was &s;eparated from his Lady&mdash;He went to Ireland, his mother went with him; but, being then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his wi&s;hes in point of rank and fortune, I am truly grieved to add, he grew di&s;&s;ipated, and of cour&s;e &s;o very rapidly involved, as inevitably lo&s;t him all con|&s;equence and e&s;teem among&s;t tho&s;e where his rank entitled him to every re&s;pect and increa&s;e of popularity and dignity. To clo&s;e my account of a gentleman &s;o much my &s;uperior, and for whom I had the &s;tronge&s;t attachments, and every rea&s;on to expect friend&s;hip and la&s;ting regard, if promi&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions may be &s;uppo&s;ed to allow a claim, added to the intercour&s;e of many years, I will fini&s;h this portrait, by mentioning when I was la&s;t in Dublin, in 1772, he was con&s;tantly with me by ten o'clock in a morning, and I often pa&s;&s;ed the evening with him, at his hou&s;e in Myrion-&s;treet, near Myrion-&s;quare. But, three nights before my return to England, my company, on Thur&s;day June 4, was particularly de&s;ired to meet Mr. Lee, attorney at law, on urgent bu&s;ine&s;s. It was our la&s;t meeting: The mighty bu&s;ine&s;s was to be a witne&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="33">
to his will, which he, Mr. Lee (now living in Dublin) drew up&mdash;No not even a ring to his me|mory&mdash;nor at my benefit, which was on the 28th of May, did he &s;o much as take a box or even a box ticket&mdash;but was there in per&s;on.&mdash;So much for friend&s;hip!&mdash;&s;o much for dependence!&mdash;But I mu&s;t not omit, that whenever I paid my re&s;pects in Myrion-&s;treet, there was plenty&mdash;nay, even a profu&s;ion of half pints of Claret, Burgundy, &amp;c. Had he regarded him&s;elf more, I might perhaps, have profited by our &s;trong intimacy, imbibed from childhood.</P>
<P>Let this be a le&s;&s;on to place as much as po&s;&s;ible our chief dependence on our&s;elves, ra|ther than rely on ideal hopes or promi&s;es from &s;uperiors.&mdash;How did I retire home to my lodging that evening, is a natural que&s;tion?&mdash;Why, good reader, whoever thou art, I a&s;&s;ure you not unhap|pily&mdash;I reflected, that had the Earl felt for his own welfare, he would in all probability have re|tained &s;ome portion of feeling and humanity for his old&mdash;his intimate friend;&mdash;and, when reclined on my pillow, found my&s;elf at that moment po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of every &s;upply for my wants, with health and &s;pirits to &s;upport tho&s;e wants; I felt my&s;elf comparatively the greate&s;t man of the two. He did not live many years after the Spring 1772. The young Lady Granard, (of whom I have not
<PB N="12" REF="34">
the lea&s;t knowledge) I believe, is married in Ire|land&mdash;The Lady Dowager Granard, was ever my &s;taunch friend; &s;he retired to England, and died, within the&s;e few years, at her villa &s;ome miles from London.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Lord Granard, I am told, bears his blu&s;hing honours thick upon him; pray God he may have no fro&s;t to nip them, but re&s;tore his family laurels to their pri&s;tine health and vigour, and with many years enjoy that felicity long want|ing to his predece&s;&s;ors.&mdash;He is &s;poke of in the warme&s;t terms by all that know him, as a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed nobleman and a fini&s;hed gentleman&mdash;I never &s;aw him, but feel an attachment from my knowledge of, and favours conferred by his family in a cour&s;e of years.</P>
<P>This little hi&s;tory, I hope, will not be found tire&s;ome to the reader, particularly if peru&s;ed by a native of Ireland; and flatter my&s;elf it will pa&s;s without cen&s;ure: for, be&s;ides being authentic, I mean, as I pur&s;ue my hi&s;torical journal, to mix various anecdotes and occurrences, without ma|king it merely a languid &s;tage repetition; &s;everal little traits of the &s;ame complexion and degree will be introduced, which I hope the reader will honour me with patience to endure, as they will in &s;ome mea&s;ure prove relieving, explanatory, en|tertaining, and, indeed, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary as a key to the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="35">
But to return to my Savoy hi&s;tory:&mdash;Added to the noble family lately recurred to, were Mr. and Mrs. William Chaigneau, from Dublin. He was agent to mo&s;t of the regiments on the Iri&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment, a gentleman univer&s;ally known, and who&s;e memory is greatly re&s;pected: He wrote, for his amu&s;ement, the novel in two volumes called <HI>Jack Connor.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Chaigneau was a lady who attracted the good opinion of every one: They had only one daughter, whom they termed their <HI>Darling Peggy:</HI> This lovely pledge they could not part with on their excur&s;ions from Ireland to England; indeed, &s;o careful were they,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They permitted not the winds of heaven to vi&s;it her face too roughly."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. Teague, Mrs. Chaigneau's &s;i&s;ter, an in|timate of my mother's, honoured me by &s;tanding as my godmother at my bapti&s;m; and in the chit chat and want of matter for conver&s;ation, when all were convened a few years after at the friendly fire-&s;ide, they propo&s;ed a wedding between Ma&s;ter Tate Wilkin&s;on and Mi&s;s Peggy Chaigneau. This was agreed to, and my father actually per|formed the ceremony; and we were afterwards jokingly called <HI>man and wife.</HI> I believe I might be, at this mock marriage, &s;ix or &s;even&mdash;young Peggy about five or &s;ix. But to the la&s;ting grief of Mr. and Mrs. Chaigneau they lo&s;t the idol of
<PB N="14" REF="36">
their heart in two or three years afterwards, and I was left a di&s;con&s;olate young widower. I men|tion this childi&s;h incident as it leads to more &s;erious matter, hereafter, in this journal of <Q REND="inline">"events and momentous hi&s;tory."</Q></P>
<P>Alderman Forbes and his Lady&mdash;the well known ancient Cornelius Kelly and his wife&mdash;and many others made up a convivial Iri&s;h party at our cheer|ful board. My father being more attentive to the plea&s;ures, than the cares of the world, I was &s;ome|times at a boarding-&s;chool, &s;ometimes not; per|haps &s;ix months in the year at Chel&s;ea with a Mr. Bellas in Church-lane there; the other &s;ix at home; the next &s;ix months at Mr. Tempe&s;t's near Wand&s;worth; then again at home, particularly if the winter was &s;evere. Some time afterwards I had tutors at home; then I went to Harrow School; but that I &s;hall hereafter have occa&s;ion to mention, as introductory to &s;omething hi&s;torical and whim|&s;ical.</P>
<P>It will here ea&s;ily be perceived I was a great pet, which too often produces ignorance and &s;tupidity, and ends in misfortunes; in &s;hort, the be&s;t part of my little education may be chiefly attributed to the cares and ob&s;ervations of a truly &s;en&s;ible, worthy, affectionate, and amiable mother, who&s;e conduct was &s;uch, as not only to attract, but pre|&s;erve the e&s;teem of all who knew her; nor is her

name ever mentioned to this hour, by any per&s;on who retains the lea&s;t recollection of her, but it is followed by the &s;igh of affection and true regard; and this equally from &s;uperiors or inferiors.</P>
<P>My idle hours, however, were not be&s;towed on marbles, cricket, or mixing with intimates of my own age and complexion;&mdash;for, except my friend George Forbes, I had but few play|mates&mdash;For, lo! a prayer-book was ever in my hand&mdash;the whole day was employed in read|ing exhortations, and every part of the church|&s;ervice: So great a proficient was I in repeating it, that I was often invited to many families to read prayers. This early &s;erious turn, gave ri&s;e to the particular notice of Mrs. Town&s;end, wife of Mr. Richard Town&s;end, who lived at the cor|ner of Durham-yard, near the we&s;t end of the &s;ince built Adelphi. This lady was remarkable for exemplary piety, accompanied with cheerful|ne&s;s and good humour; from which occurred many acts of charity and benevolence. My fa|ther had &s;uch attraction as a preacher, that &s;he would not have mi&s;&s;ed the Savoy-church on a Sunday on any account; no &s;light indi&s;po&s;ition could keep her away; though, from a bad &s;tate of health, the Savoy-church was the only place &s;he vi&s;ited, unle&s;s on &s;ome particular occa&s;ion not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.&mdash;This good old lady was
<PB N="16" REF="38">
own &s;i&s;ter to the late Jonas Hanway; a gentle|man univer&s;ally known and e&s;teemed for his many benevolent acts. With this &s;aid &s;i&s;ter, Mr. Jonas Hanway <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ived many years: He had been a friend of my father's, continued his good will to me, and was indefatigable in the Spring 1769 in removing the objections &s;tarted by Lord Sondes, in regard to my obtaining acts of Parliament for the York and Hull patents: For, unle&s;s Mr. Jonas Hanway's influence and per&s;everance had prevailed on his Lord&s;hip to withdraw his oppo&s;ition (which at that time, from his &s;ituation and con&s;e|quence in the Hou&s;e, had great weight), it would have prevented, in all probability, my having ac|quired the honour and credit of either. Captain Hanway, the brother of Jonas, was married by my father to Mi&s;s Stowe, the then reigning toa&s;t of Newark-upon-Trent.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Town&s;ends' con&s;tant attendance to their religious duties at the Savoy, among&s;t my father's pious admirers as a preacher, I remember Mrs. Graham, late Mrs. Yates, never mi&s;&s;ed her pew near the pulpit. Mr. Yates, now living, was a frequent attendant, and can and will te&s;tify that Dr. Wilkin&s;on's manner of reading and preach|ing commanded re&s;pect and admiration. His di&s;|cour&s;es were excellent, his voice clear, &s;trong, and &s;onorous, and his per&s;on graceful and hand&s;ome.
<PB N="17" REF="39">
The few remaining per&s;ons who knew him then will now verify what I advance; for though only re&s;ident &s;ix weeks at Wakefield, and that not le&s;s than forty-five years ago, yet his man|ner of preaching, and forcible oratory, &amp;c. had &s;uch &s;trong effects, as to be well recollected at that place to this hour; and was often mentioned by the late Sir Michael Pilkington, who was at that time his intimate.</P>
<P>I being forcibly &s;truck with my father's man|ner in the &s;everal church &s;ervices, was never ea&s;y unle&s;s I had an old &s;urplice thrown over my &s;houlders, and my whole delight was in praying&punc; preaching, burials, &amp;c. I was generally locked up in a room, &s;uppo&s;ing it a church; and in a large chair, the bottom taken out, went through the morning or evening &s;ervice as it happened to occur in the cour&s;e of the day; then replacing the chair bottom, and throwing off the old &s;urplice of my father's that had ju&s;t before occupied my &s;houlders, I mounted and leaned over the back of the &s;aid chair, and with mighty authority pro|ceeded with the &s;ermon; &s;everal of which di&s;|cour&s;es were my father's.</P>
<P>My father was much plea&s;ed with this preaching turn, and on his hearing from Mrs. Town&s;end, my mother, and &s;everal others, how remarkably well I read prayers, and by all univer&s;ally allow|ed
<PB N="18" REF="40">
to be the father's own &s;on in voice, manner, energy, &amp;c. he pronounced Tate would make a great figure, if brought up to the church.</P>
<P>As it occurs to me this moment, &s;o I am cer|tain it will to my reader, who will a&s;k, How could you, Mr. Tate, &s;o audibly go on with this practice of preaching and praying a-loud under the &s;ame roof with your father, and without his knowledge? That is ea&s;ily an&s;wered:&mdash;For know, good Sir, or Madam, the hou&s;e we then occupied was large enough for three modern ones; old double &s;tone &s;tair-ca&s;es; and were truly the apart|ments of King John of France<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Hi&s;tory of the Savoy.</NOTE>, when he was pri&s;oner in England: So I had always apart|ments which I called my own, and they were in con&s;equence appropriated to my religious rites.</P>
<P>My father, on the intelligence he had received of my pious inclinations, importuned me to read prayers, the litany, &amp;c. by way of &s;ample, to cor|roborate what he had heard from Mrs. Town&s;|end, my mother, and others. I cheerfully com|plied; and on hearing me he much approved, and &s;aid he judged my &s;eeing plays might aid my &s;trong inclination, as well as contribute and a&s;&s;i&s;t me in the mode of public &s;peaking. Now, reader, don't &s;uppo&s;e this fond father and mo|ther

were wicked play-goers;&mdash;I do not remember ever hearing of their being at three plays in their whole lives. Mo&s;t probably, had that been the ca&s;e, a playhou&s;e would have been familiarized to my ear: Not that I mean to convey they had a di&s;like to plays; indeed, quite the rever&s;e: But my father's affairs were generally in an embarra&s;&s;ed &s;tate, and my mother's pocket too much deranged to allow money for &s;uch an entertainment; con|&s;equently, tho' &s;he admired and approved of a good play, &s;he was contented with the reading in|&s;tead of &s;eeing it: However they both wi&s;hed to have Tate &s;ee a play. But having been, when five years old, with my father at a puppet-&s;hew at Bartholemew-Fair, which I thought a play, I there &s;aw a &s;ea fight, and a mo&s;t terrible battle, which determined me never to &s;ee one again;&mdash;therefore all propo&s;als to go to the Theatre were in vain.</P>
<P>When about eight years old, chance threw a Mr. Page in my way. He was then Hou&s;e-keeper of Covent-Garden Theatre, known at that time only by, <Q REND="inline">"Which hou&s;e do you go to this evening&mdash;the New Hou&s;e, or the Old?"</Q> (Drury Lane.) Mr. Page wi&s;hed for &s;ome place then in the power of Lord Cholmondley, with whom my father was intimate; and to ingratiate him&s;elf the more, (finding neither Dr. Wilkin&s;on nor his wife vi&s;ited
<PB N="20" REF="42">
either old or new hou&s;e) he ob&s;erved it was a pity Ma&s;ter Tate &s;hould not enjoy the diver&s;ions of the theatre.&mdash;When I heard this conver&s;ation, I felt an inconceivable objection, and dreaded the being forced into &s;o terrible a place. My mother ob&s;erved, that Tate would think of prayers only, and could not be per&s;uaded to &s;et his foot in a theatre; but, on after-reflection, they ob&s;erved at what an ea&s;y rate, from the civility of Mr. Page, this entertainment could be procured, they determined to conquer my ob&s;tinacy by force. So, after my repeated refu&s;als, my reverend dad at la&s;t grew really angry, and in&s;i&s;ted on my going there, with this conditional &s;alvo, that if I was not plea&s;ed, he pledged his honour he would never urge me to &s;ee another. I, choked with grief, a&s;&s;ented to this cruelty, as I really thought it was; and when from the Savoy I had with &s;low &s;teps arrived at Southampton-&s;treet, I grew &s;ulky, and the &s;ervant to whom I was intru&s;ted had actually to drag me to Covent-Garden Theatre. On &s;eeing Mr. Page, the man being in livery, Ma&s;ter Tate could not be let into the boxes or pit: this I e&s;teemed a lucky circum&s;tance to fa|vour my return; indeed had I been left to my&s;elf, &s;oon would I have &s;aluted the Savoy &s;teps; but the man wi&s;hing to &s;ee the play, during this new &s;tarted difficulty kept me fa&s;t as his pri&s;oner, I was
<PB N="21" REF="43">
conveyed with him, and &s;afely &s;towed in the upper gallery: in&s;tead of receiving plea&s;ure, &s;ighs and &s;obs employed my time in this terrible place. Neither the noble theatre, nor the mu&s;ic had any charms for me: the whi&s;tling of the gods, and other noi&s;es of the gallery, only added to my di&s;|gu&s;t and terror. The play, I well remember, was the Bu&s;y Body, with Mr. Foote's Tea&mdash;But, O reader! of what materials are we com|po&s;ed!&mdash;&s;carcely had the fir&s;t act fini&s;hed before I imagined I was in the ely&s;ium I had been praying for; the charms of the church, which the day be|fore were &s;o attractive and &s;ublime, were di&s;&s;olved&mdash;
<Q><L>And, like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a Vi&s;ion,</L>
<L>Left not a wreck behind.</L></Q></P>
<P>The theatre from that time bani&s;hed all my &s;ervent piety, and my whole thoughts were oc|cupied with the fa&s;cinating charms of the play|hou&s;e, actors, and actre&s;&s;es. My father&mdash;(O wicked man! &s;ays one of the mock &s;aints) was plea&s;ed with the change, and &s;aid he was &s;ure it would be the means of making me a better preacher: I now rever&s;ed my late tabernacle&mdash;and employed my evenings in lighting pieces of candle, dre&s;&s;ing in any fanta&s;tical attire, and re|peated, as well as I could recollect, parts in plays I had &s;een; which that Spring were nine in num|ber. From early in January to March, I took
<PB N="22" REF="44">
great care to vi&s;it Mr. Page every morning for play bills; and was a con&s;tant attendant by per|mi&s;&s;ion, at the morning rehear&s;als. In March I was &s;ent to Mr. Tempe&s;t's &s;chool near Wand&s;|worth, where a nephew and two &s;ons of Mr. Page's were placed; and I &s;aw no more plays till the Winter following.</P>
<P>At the time I have now mentioned &s;eeing plays at Covent-Garden Theatre, Mr. Quin had re|tired to Bath, from whence he wrote the follow|ing laconic note, in November, 1747:<LETTER>
<P>I am at Bath.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, JAMES QUIN.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER> Which note was as laconically an&s;wered:<LETTER>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Every actor of con&s;equence was engaged by Mr. Garrick for Drury-Lane, except the Mr. Quin ju&s;t mentioned: This was Garrick's fir&s;t year a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> manager. At Covent Garden&punc; in the mont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of February, they only acted three times in the week, and frequently di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and were in truth a wretched company, and low in public e&s;timation. Mr. Foote's Tea, which he had given as an en|tertainment at Covent-Garden Theatre in Fe|bruary 1748, he had fir&s;t acted in 1746, at the
<PB N="23" REF="45">
Hay Market; it was then called The Diver&s;ions of the Morning, attended with great good for|tune, and every &s;ucce&s;s his mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes could &s;ugge&s;t; but this being noticed by the Patentees of Drury-Lane and Covent-Garden, as an entertainment &s;tarted in defiance of the &s;evere act about that time pa&s;&s;ed, when Lord Che&s;terfield had ob&s;erved in the Hou&s;e of Lords, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How cruel it was to lay a tax on &s;o &s;carce a commodity as wit."&mdash;"Wit," continues Lord Che&s;terfield, "is a &s;ort of property of tho&s;e that have it, and too often the only property they have to depend on.&mdash;It is, indeed, but a precari|ous dependence.&mdash;Thank God! we, my Lords, have a dependence of another kind."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Foote had in this moment not only alarmed the trea&s;ury of the royal theatres; but, from his mimicry, had rou&s;ed the indignation and re&s;ent|ment of all the performers. Application was made in con&s;equence to the Lord Chamberlain, who &s;ent to the ju&s;tices of that di&s;trict, and the new rai&s;ed troops were put to flight, by a &s;uperior force of con&s;tables entering the theatre in terrible array! The audience was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,&mdash;and the laughing Ari&s;tophanes left leaning towards Mel|pomene, in doleful &s;oliloquy.</P>
<P>After many days anxiety from &s;uffering this di&s;|grace, a lucky thought occurred to him:&mdash;Being
<PB N="24" REF="46">
certain of the good will of the Town, he adverti&s;ed <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Mr. Foote's compliments to his friends and the public, de&s;iring them to drink Tea at the Little Theatre at the Hay-Market, every morning, at the play-hou&s;e prices."</Q>&mdash;The joke &s;ucceeded&mdash;the hou&s;e was crowded&mdash;and he advanced before the curtain&mdash;being privately a&s;&s;ured of protection, (his friends having been previou&s;ly convened and informed of his intention) and &s;aid&mdash;That while the Tea was preparing, as he was then training &s;ome young actors for the &s;tage, he would, with their permi&s;&s;ion, proceed with his in&s;tructions. This manoeuvre was highly reli&s;hed; and it be|came the univer&s;al fa&s;hion every noon to drink a di&s;h of Mr. Foote's Tea; and, for two or three years, he termed pieces of imitation <HI>giving of Tea.</HI> And thence aro&s;e the puzzle which often hap|pened to my&s;elf (&s;ome years after) on my giving Tea; and it frequently &s;tarted difficulties and chagrin to a country audience.</P>
<P>The run of this morning's diver&s;ion occa&s;ioned the actors one and all to exclaim they &s;hould be ruined by his mimicry; therefore Mr. Foote very plea&s;antly &s;aid, Since that was the ca&s;e, it was his duty to provide a &s;ituation for each lady and gentleman, &s;o circum&s;tanced; and that, in&s;tead of murdering blank ver&s;e, and a&s;&s;uming the characters of Kings and Queens, Lords and Ladies,
<PB N="25" REF="47">
for which their abilities were far from being &s;uitable, he would place them where their talents and behaviour could with more propriety be employed:</P>
<P>Mr. QUIN,&mdash;from his &s;onorous voice and weighty manner he appointed&mdash;<HI>a Watchman:</HI> <LB>AS THUS;<Q>"Pa&s;t twelve o'clock, and a cloudy morning."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. DELANE&mdash;was &s;uppo&s;ed to have but one eye, therefore he fixed him as&mdash;<HI>a Beggar Man in St. Paul's Church-yard:</HI><Q>"Would you be&s;tow your pity on a poor blind man."</Q></P>
<P>Mr. RYAN,&mdash;who&s;e voice for oddity and &s;hrill|ne&s;s was remarkable,&mdash;<HI>a Razor Grinder:</HI><Q>"Razors to grind, &s;ci&s;&s;ars to grind, penknives to grind."</Q></P>
<P>Mrs. WOFFINGTON,&mdash;though beautiful to a degree had a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant &s;queaking pipe,&mdash;<HI>an Orange Woman to the Playhou&s;e:</HI><Q>"Would you have &s;ome oranges,&mdash;have &s;ome orange chips, ladies and gentlemen,&mdash;would you have &s;ome nonpareils,&mdash;would you have a bill of the play?"</Q></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="48">Mr. WOODWARD,&mdash;he was puzzled to find any trade he was fit for, therefore &s;poke the fol|lowing &s;peech, in his voice and manner, from Sir Fopling Flutter.<Q>"Wherever I go, there goes a gentleman&mdash;upon my life a gentleman, and when you have &s;aid a gentleman, why, O! [<HI>here Foote dropt Woodward's voice and manner</HI>] you have &s;aid more than is true."</Q></P>
<P>He was al&s;o very &s;evere on GARRICK, who was apt to he&s;itate, (in his dying &s;cenes in particular) as in the character of Lothario&mdash;<Q>&mdash;"adorns my fall, and chea&mdash;chea&mdash;chea&mdash;chea&mdash;chea&mdash;chears my heart in dy&mdash;dy&mdash;dying."</Q></P>
<P>Foote's Tea, remembered by me &s;o well from that time, when I became advanced in life made it &s;eem &s;trange that almo&s;t every per&s;on two hun|dred miles from the metropolis was not as well ac|quainted with it as my&s;elf, who had lived in Lon|don, without con&s;idering my long re&s;idence there had &s;tamped a &s;tronger remembrance on me than on three parts out of four of the re&s;t of the inha|bitants of that city.</P>
<P>To elucidate this matter I need only in&s;tance Mr. Foote's pieces even of modern date, mo&s;t of
<PB N="27" REF="49">
them &s;trongly pointed, animated, and bold in the drawing, not de&s;titute of great wit in the com|po&s;ition, and plea&s;ing to a degree in the repre&s;en|tation,&mdash;yet being local, and at the &s;ame time merely drawn for reflections on the follies of the day, their merit and claim to &s;upport cannot pre|vent their po&s;ting to oblivion; while, for years to come, we &s;hall behold pieces of inferior merit, only aided by flim&s;y in&s;ipid mediocrity, proceed with dulne&s;s, and make their exit with a natural decay.

When in town, every morning, by Mr. Page's permi&s;&s;ion, I attended the rehear&s;al: There the de&s;ire to become an actor at only ten years of age appeared very con&s;picuous, and will fully prove and clear an error conceived by Mr. Churchill, (who was afterwards convinced to the contrary) that Mr. Foote in&s;tructed me in the art of imita|tion; which was neither truth, nor within the bounds of po&s;&s;ibility: My frequent morning's admittance at the theatre, for two years, intoxica|ted my brain, and when I returned from that (to me) mo&s;t luxurious treat, my mind was &s;olely employed with acting and &s;tudying plays, particu|larly tho&s;e I had &s;een and which had made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. I formed a mad idea thus early that I was certainly a manager of a theatre; and when locked up in a room, I there &s;uppo&s;ed my&s;elf, by turns, the different per&s;ons I had ob&s;erved. This rehear&s;ing frenzy increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree that at la&s;t I fitted up a room in a theatrical manner; as a proof I have now &s;everal hundred of my play|bills, in full-&s;ized paper, wrote in red and black, and could at this in&s;tant as ea&s;ily tell what plays, farces, and pantomimes were performed at my theatre in the Savoy, with a knowledge of all the performers, whether married, &s;ingle, old, or young, and what they played, as if all the vi&s;ion had been realized&mdash;The bills I have often produ|ced,
<PB N="33" REF="55">
not as a proof of my &s;en&s;e, but in&s;anity, or theatrical influenza.</P>
<P>The rehear&s;als that year were very regular at Covent-Garden. The &s;cenes for Volpone, Hen|ry IV. and their &s;tock plays, (for, at that hou&s;e, they &s;eldom acted new ones or revived old ones) were regularly changed&mdash;and all was awful &s;ilence.&mdash;Mr. Quin was &s;ole monarch, and had a manner mo&s;t terrible to the under performers, car|penters, &amp;c.; if he &s;pied me within two yards of the wings&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Get away, boy!"</Q>&mdash;and &s;truck his cane with &s;uch violence as made me tremble.</P>
<P>Mrs. Woffington had that year left David Gar|rick for more rea&s;ons than one:&mdash;Fir&s;t, &s;he had (before he proved a fal&s;e &s;wain) lived with the charming Garrick, who wrote a favourite &s;ong called <HI>Lovely Peggy</HI>&mdash;
<Q><L>Once more I'll tune the vocal &s;hell,</L>

She was mortified at his marriage, for &s;he lo&s;t the reigning &s;way &s;he expected to have had in &s;ha|ring the cares of monarchy.&mdash;Mrs. Pritchard's divi&s;ion of characters hurt her; and Mrs. Clive, who was &s;uperior to fear, was a con&s;tant thorn. So much has been &s;aid of Mrs. Woffington, that it is needle&s;s to mention her Lady Townly, Lady Betty, &amp;c.&mdash;An elegant figure in breeches&mdash;&s;he looked and acted Sir Harry Wildair with &s;uch &s;pi|rit
<PB N="34" REF="56">
and deportment, that &s;he gave flat contradic|tion to what Farquhar a&s;&s;erted,&mdash;That when Wilks died, Sir Harry Wildair might go to the Jubilee;&mdash;and yet &s;o far has his prophecy been fully verified, no male performer, even Garrick or Woodward, &s;uc|ceeded, but all have failed in that part; &s;he repeated it with never cea&s;ing applau&s;e for &s;everal years. Her ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ellence, when at Drury-Lane, occa&s;ioned the following joke, which I do not give as new, but hope it will bear the repeating.</P>
<P>Dame Clive and that lady were ever at variance: Mrs. Woffington coming into the green-room, after a favourite &s;cene in Sir Harry, in high &s;pirits, exultingly &s;aid to Mrs Clive&mdash;She had got &s;o much applau&s;e, that, by the living God! &s;he believed one half of the audience took her for a man.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O!"&mdash;&s;ays Clive, <HI>archly</HI>&mdash;"do not be unea&s;y, as you are &s;atisfied the other half know the con|trary"</Q></P>
<P>The early part of this &s;ea&s;on I had been at a correct rehear&s;al of the Carele&s;s Hu&s;band&mdash;Lord Foppington, Mr Cibber; Sir Charles Ea&s;y, Mr. Ryan; Lord Morelove, Mr. Delane; Lady Ea&s;y, Mrs. Ward; Lady Graveairs, Mrs. Hale; Edging, Mrs. Ridout; Lady Betty Modi&s;h, Mrs. Woffington;&mdash;after which I ha&s;tened home to repeat what I could recollect. My mother ob&s;er|ving me &s;o particular, &s;tood at the room door to li&s;ten, as &s;he thought &s;he heard a talking, and
<PB N="35" REF="57">
hearing me pronounce in a &s;trange voice&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"My Lord Foppington give me my &s;nuff-box."</Q>&mdash;She, after dinner, de&s;ired to know what I was talk|ing of when &s;hut up by my&s;elf? I was rather perplexed, and &s;aid&mdash;I had fancied all that day I was &s;ometimes Mr. Cibber, but oftener Mrs. Woffington, as &s;he had acted Lady Betty delight|fully. On this &s;he &s;ent for the play, and I &s;tudied different parts of it, and al&s;o the fir&s;t &s;cene of Sir John and Lady Brute, which I had &s;een that win|ter: I was then, I believe, very like Mr. Quin and Mrs. Woffington; nay, am certain I was, as I can repeat the &s;ame at this in&s;tant in like manner; a proof what force fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions make in the days of our youth.</P>
<P>This &s;oon produced (when I was vi&s;iting abroad, or when we had company at home) an intreaty for Ma&s;ter Tate to act Mr. Quin and Mrs. Wof|fington: The applau&s;e of the company added fuel to the flame.&mdash;Drury-Lane Theatre I did not &s;ee till the &s;ea&s;on 1750, and, &s;trange to tell! did not wi&s;h to go there, &s;o &s;trongly was I attached to &s;weet Covent-Garden;&mdash;and a &s;omething like hal|lowed ground, to this moment, occa&s;ions reve|rence and awe for the &s;teps and avenues of that theatre. A full hou&s;e at Covent-Garden, then, was plea&s;ing intelligence:&mdash;The preference and &s;ucce&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">f Garrick and Drury-Lane I could not reli&s;h.&mdash;
<PB N="36" REF="58">
This employment I pur&s;ued with unremitting &s;la|very, even to the prejudice of health.</P>
<P>In September 1749, I had an ague and fever, which could not be conquered, but kept me con|fined all the winter, except being permitted to &s;ee three plays: Lady Jane Grey was one, and to this moment I recollect Quin, &s;aying in Gardiner, <Q REND="inline">"I hold no &s;peech with hereticks and traitors."</Q></P>
<P>September 1750 was the remarkable year Barry and Cibber joined forces with Quin and Woffing|ton at Covent-Garden, as al&s;o Macklin. On &s;ee|ing Mr. Barry and Mrs. Cibber, le&s;&s;ened in my opi|nion the merit I had alone allowed to my fir&s;t fa|vorites, Mr. Quin and Mrs. Woffington.

The fir&s;t play I &s;aw at Drury-Lane was that year;&mdash;it was the Mourning Bride&mdash;O&s;myn, Mr. Garrick; Zara, Mrs. Pritchard; Almeria, Mi&s;s Bellamy.&mdash;Garrick was not in my &s;ecret opinion &s;o enchanting as Barry&mdash;Mi&s;s Bellamy very infe|rior indeed to Mrs. Cibber&mdash;but Mrs. Pritchard's Zara &s;truck me with admiration. The farce was Lethe; in which the characters were &s;o inimitably performed by Woodward, Yates, Shuter, Blakes, Mi&s;s Minors, and Mrs. Clive, that I felt actually angry at my&s;elf for being &s;o plea&s;ed with the performers of the Old Hou&s;e, when in a comparative view with my favorites of the New. I mention this, as an in&s;tance of the force of ob&s;tinate and head&s;trong par|tiality, whether we are young or old; and am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that conviction or rea&s;on, will not conquer our prejudices as we grow old, any more than prevail over the &s;entiments of waxen youth.</P>
<P>The Winter of 1750, I &s;aw &s;everal plays; and for fear of being tainted with the prevailing powers of Drury-Lane, entered not that fa&s;hion|able p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ace of re&s;ort. The end of the &s;ea&s;on Mr. Quin left the &s;tage; the opening play in the Sep|tember following, (1751) was the Recruiting Of|ficer, at Covent-Garden; Mrs. Woffington's name was in&s;erted for Sylvia, but on &s;ome &s;udden

<P>In October 1751, was Mr. Mo&s;&s;op's and Mr. Ro&s;s's fir&s;t appearance at Drury-Lane, in the characters of Richard and young Bevil. I pa&s;&s;ed my time as the preceding &s;ea&s;on, only with this difference, that I attended both Theatres; they clo&s;ed as u&s;ual.&mdash;In the Autumn, what I had ar|dently wi&s;hed for, two years before, came to pa&s;s; as my being &s;ent to Harrow School was put into real practice, by my coming to the age of thir|teen, the en&s;uing 7th of Nov. 1752, (being the year of the New Style). This, when at a di&s;tance, I thought plea&s;ing, but for a Manager a Critic, to be &s;ent to &s;chool, was a &s;troke of real grief and horror; my pride prevented me from owning the truth, for I had &s;ometime before petitioned for this indulgence, therefore would not let my vera|city or re&s;olution be called in que&s;tion.&mdash;So, O woeful day! to Harrow School I was conveyed by my mother; where, on &s;eeing my friend George Forbes, I endeavoured to compo&s;e my&s;elf, and &s;ubmit to &s;lavery. He introduced me to the Duke of Gordon, and his brother, Lord Adam Gordon; al&s;o at that &s;chool, (which was then &s;econd only to Eaton in this kingdom,) were Lord Downe, Sir John Ru&s;&s;iate, and the Capt. Dives's, to whom I have been much obliged. But
<PB N="40" REF="62">
in&s;tead of the place becoming more ea&s;y by habit, the manager ro&s;e &s;trongly in my heated imagina|tion:&mdash;Studying a play was the employment of a man, but going to &s;chool, the God of Idlene&s;s convinced me was intolerable;&mdash;I therefore re|&s;olved on a retreat, not doubting but if I related to my mother, that I had &s;een three boys whipt, &s;he would relent and receive me home again, and &s;often all re&s;entment from my father, who hu|moured me to a greater degree than &s;he did her|&s;elf; but when he was in a pa&s;&s;ion, which thank God was but &s;eldom, it was dreadful! To exe|cute with wi&s;dom and di&s;cretion, &s;uch a dangerous undertaking, the good, the unfortunate Andr&eacute;e u&s;ed not more precaution.&mdash;I waited for a public holiday, and loading my pockets with oranges and gingerbread the night before, got up at &s;ix in the morning, and proceeded down Harrow-Hill; unfortunately, not being accu&s;tomed to the road, I turned to the right, and every now and then looked up to &s;py if any one was pur&s;uing me, &s;o &s;trong is guilt.&mdash;
<Q><L>Su&s;picion ever haunts the guilty mind&mdash;</L>
<L>The thief doth fear each bu&s;h an officer.</L></Q></P>
<P>Having walked for &s;ome time, I read on a &s;tone <Q REND="inline">"One mile to Partington,"</Q> or &s;ome &s;uch name; I was alarmed, and ha&s;tened back to my old
<PB N="41" REF="63">
ground, the bottom of the hill: If I looked be|hind, and &s;aw a man on hor&s;eback, I was &s;ure he was in pur&s;uit of me. I &s;oon reached the fifth mile-&s;tone, where &s;ome men were at work on the roads; here I was again puzzled, by a &s;eparation of two broad carriage-ways, and fearing a &s;econd blunder, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Pray, good men, which is the road to London?" "Why," &s;ays one of them&mdash;"to the left; but I am afraid, young gentleman, you have run away from &s;chool?"&mdash;"No indeed," &s;ays I, and to convince him he was wrong, took the only me|thod to prove him quite in the right, by imme|diately taking to my heels. The men laughed, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d cried, "Catch him,&mdash;&s;top him."</Q>&mdash;I was tru|ly a frightened hare. After &s;tumbling, running, &amp;c. at la&s;t I was obliged from &s;ickne&s;s and great fatigue to &s;top; but, finding no pur&s;uers, in about ten minutes I continued my journey, and got &s;afe into London: When advanced beyond the pur|lieus, I &s;topped at a coffee-hou&s;e, and breakfa&s;t|ed. One danger being over, I now began, when hunger was &s;atisfied, to feel other qualms, which were the approach of home: I walked very &s;low, and got to the Savoy, ju&s;t as the bell was ringing for prayers; I &s;auntered till it cea&s;ed, well knowing that my father was then &s;ecure, and for fear of mi&s;take took a peep to be certain that he read the prayers. That point being &s;ettled to my &s;a|tisfaction,
<PB N="42" REF="64">
I rapped at the door, and &s;oon with perfect ea&s;e, a&s;ked my mother how &s;he did.&mdash;Her &s;urpri&s;e was great&mdash;all my relation of cruel|ties, and whipping the little boys would not avail; &s;he expo&s;tulated on the great expence of the en|trance to the ma&s;ters, as Dr. Thackerey, Mr. Prior, &amp;c.&mdash;&s;aid &s;he would &s;often the matter as well as &s;he could&mdash;but back I mu&s;t go&mdash;I was ordered to retire; and on &s;o doing, my reflections were by no means the mo&s;t plea&s;ant. When com|manded into the pre&s;ence of my father, I was conditionally pardoned; but after a bit of dinner, for which I had not the lea&s;t appetite, a chai&s;e was ordered, and a &s;ervant &s;ent with me, who was to &s;top the carriage at the bottom of Harrow Hill, in order if po&s;&s;ible, that my difgrace of running away might be a &s;ecret. This I was obliged to &s;ubmit to, and I arrived at the fatal &s;pot, like a culprit prepared for execution; but when I came to the borders of the village, I &s;oon heard the warhoop of Indians, and perceived almo&s;t the whole &s;chool a&s;&s;embled, and ready to tar and fea|ther me for my flight.</P>
<P>From many tokens of intelligence and &s;earching enquiries, I was &s;oon di&s;covered to have been more than merely out of bounds. I therefore like a poor de&s;erter, wanted no more than hand|cuffs, to make my appearance and contrition truly
<PB N="43" REF="65">
in character, when, like a god, my friend George Forbes appeared, (who was held in great re&s;pect and e&s;teem) drew me from my di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, and under his arm conveyed me &s;afe to Mr. Reeves's (the writing ma&s;ter) hou&s;e, where I was boarded, and delivered me from the hands of the Phili&s;tines. Mr. and Mrs. Reeves were of a a genteel turn; and what do you think, good rea|der, better than that,&mdash;they were critics, and fond of plays; and what was better &s;till, Mrs. Reeves's &s;i&s;ter (then on a vi&s;it) was play and romance mad; but at this time of di&s;tre&s;s, I was not acquainted with tho&s;e delightful circum&s;tances; however they were kind, not au&s;tere upon my di&s;grace; and Mr. Reeves interfered to prevent the de&s;erter's corporal puni&s;hment; but the adventure reached the ear of Admiral Forbes, who fearing my bad example might have an ill effect on his newphew, over whom he judged I had great influence, which might occa&s;ion his taking a trip over to Dublin, to &s;ee <HI>his mamma,</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on my being made an example of terror, by way of prevention.</P>
<P>Dr. Thackerey, was as benign and humane a man, as ever was placed at the head of &s;uch an unruly community as a public &s;chool; but the Reverend Prior, loved to lift his arm up for the awful flogging, better than Fielding's Par&s;on Thwackum, and judged him&s;elf robbed of his
<PB N="44" REF="66">
rights, when he was prevented from putting in force his love of torture; he was in truth a de|&s;picable, &s;evere, and di&s;agreeable tyrant: But on the hint being given, while he went out of the great &s;chool-room, I believe I might be &s;peaking a little too loud, when the head &s;cholar ordered me to &s;tand before the throne, and am &s;orry to &s;ay, except from my friend George Forbes, I perceived univer&s;al exultation; for the lad that runs away is looked on like the cowardly &s;oldier who retires on the day of battle: Soon entered Governor Prior, who with exulting features, ordered me to be prepared and brought immediately to the block, and, to &s;trike terror, de&s;ired attention to his &s;kill on the occa&s;ion; and as what mu&s;t be, mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, I patiently re&s;igned to my cruel fate. He ne|ver acted the barbarian better&mdash;<Q><L>The blood did follow where the rod was driven,</L>
<L>The fle&s;h did quiver where the birchen tore;</L>
<L>But that was foreign to the &s;oul&mdash;</L>

<L>Cou'd force a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an away that he might gue&s;s at.</L></Q></P>
<P>This proved in fact a mo&s;t lucky adventure&mdash;as misfortunes pa&s;t prove &s;tories of delight; for, when &s;chool was over, I was generally &s;aluted and applauded for my heroi&s;m, and from that time was on good terms with all the &s;cholars. My boarding-hou&s;e became every day more &s;a|tisfactory;
<PB N="45" REF="67">
for my fond mother, to keep me ea&s;y under my bondage, after &s;uch a life of indulgence as I had been accu&s;tomed to, was even near in her family expences, and denied her&s;elf what was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;end Tate luxuries, &s;uch as tea, &s;ugar, nice chickens, bottles of wine, pound cake, &amp;c. with the play-bills of the week: tho&s;e pre&s;ents I gave to Mrs. Reeves, which occa&s;ioned an intimacy, and my &s;itting up to &s;upper; this brought on &s;tage conver&s;ation, and from that I was a&s;ked, whenever they had com|pany, to act plays. So con&s;idering my&s;elf as a ma|nager in di&s;tre&s;s, the time pa&s;&s;ed tolerably plea&s;ant till December. We had only one di&s;pute, which was Mr. Reeves's pronouncing Garrick not only the be&s;t actor, but what was more intolerable, the be&s;t Romeo; to which I mu&s;t have yielded, had not the wife declared entirely on my &s;ide of the argument, and wondered her hu&s;band could make &s;uch a compari&s;on&mdash;the &s;i&s;ter avowed the &s;ame; and they both agreed that Barry was a charming man, and made love like an angel, to which I a&s;&s;ented and &s;ignificantly &s;aid, It was not worth contending; for it really was not every one that &s;aw a play who was a perfect judge of acting.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to ob&s;erve how nece&s;&s;a|ry it is to make every one a wellwi&s;her, in&s;tead of an enemy:&mdash;Friends are happy circum&s;tances;
<PB N="46" REF="68">
they are the foundation-&s;tone of human greatne&s;s, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t;&mdash;civility is worth the pre&s;erving, for if offended, a Star and Garter may find him&s;elf hurt by the rudene&s;s of a black|guard: Therefore as many friends as po&s;&s;ible it is our intere&s;t to procure, provided they can be gained without de&s;cending to meanne&s;s.&mdash;A few in&s;ignificant enemies are not ami&s;s, they rou&s;e the &s;pirits to action and vigour; while the kindne&s;s of friends and &s;elf-love are &s;o far from improving the mental faculties, that they only act on the under&s;tanding as laudanum, and all real genius is lulled into lethargy and &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>From my civility to Mrs. Reeves's &s;i&s;ter, I was not only made of &s;ome little con&s;equence at Harrow; but the &s;equel will prove it led to an <HI>important</HI> part of my future life.</P>
<P>While at Mr. Reeves's, a theatrical f&ecirc;te was to be given before the Chri&s;tmas holidays in the great &s;chool-room, as the cu&s;tom had been for &s;ome years to act three nights before that period, to which all the families from Stanmore and the adjacent villages were invited; the room was very commodious for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. Shapes were borrowed from Mr. Rich, who, it &s;eems, always obliged the &s;chool on &s;uch occa&s;ions. Dr. Thackerey (the good governor) fixed on the Roman Father for the leading &s;cholars to enact.

The fir&s;t night the play was pre&s;ented I was an auditor, but Mrs. Reeves and her &s;i&s;ter were &s;tung to the quick; their pride was hurt to think their favourite boarder, and &s;uch a promi&s;ing actor, had not a chance for fame, and a &s;hare of the ap|plau&s;e at this public time.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reeves's &s;i&s;ter felt her&s;elf &s;o unhappy on this trivial matter, that &s;he waited on Dr. Thac|kerey with me in her hand, and reque&s;ted I might reh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ar&s;e Lord and Lady Townly, which the Doctor good-naturedly a&s;&s;ented to; and I in&s;tantly performed Lord Townly, <HI>a-la-mode</HI> Barry&mdash;Lady Townly, <HI>a-la-mode</HI> Woffington, which actually broke through the buckram of the college and the Doctor's accu&s;tomed &s;olemnity, and he and his good woman laughed very heartily; for though he never &s;aw more than three or four plays in a year, and that during the Chri&s;tmas rece&s;s, the tran&s;ition of voice and manner from Barry to Woffington, plea&s;ed the Doctor &s;o much, that he actually &s;ent for his elde&s;t &s;on Frederick, and de|&s;ired him to &s;tudy the fir&s;t &s;cene of Lord Townly, and ordered it to precede the Roman Father the next play-night; to which Mr. Frederick like a good &s;on acquie&s;ced, promi&s;ed to be perfect, bowed, retired, and kept his word.

<P>After, not le&s;s than three hours in the equip|ment, a chair (which I wonder at in &s;o &s;mall a place) was to be hired, to convey me to Harrow-Theatre, and not I a&s;&s;ure you without &s;ome emo|tion: not that my fir&s;t acting &s;eemed di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, nor was it particular my playing Lady Townly, as two young gentlemen of family per&s;onated Horatia, and Valeria; and as to dre&s;s, my Engli&s;h attire as much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Roman ladies on this occa&s;ion, as Mrs. Bellamy's new Paris-dre&s;s is a&s;&s;erted by her to have out&s;hone Mrs. Woffing|ton's, when they acted the Rival Queens: How|ever not having in reality played before any num|ber of per&s;ons fit to be termed an audience, it gave me a tremor natural to all young actors. My performance was &s;o much &s;uperior, and &s;o in|finitely more like a theatrical one, than that of the young gentlemen who acted in the Roman Father, that I bore away the palm, notwith&s;tand|ing Publius was repre&s;ented by a Lord! Nor is it to be wondered at, as they played only from an

e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom of the &s;chool; therefore merely judged it a plea&s;ing relief, as by &s;o doing for ten or twelve days they relinqui&s;hed the dryer &s;tudies of Greek and Latin; but no more likely to make a figure as actors, without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the God, than tho&s;e young per&s;ons were, who are related to have acted with Garrick when he was a child at Litchfield; for they, as his play-mates, performed merely from civility and compliance to his will, whil&s;t we may venture to pronounce <HI>his</HI> whole &s;oul was in agitation.</P>
<P>The effect of my Lady Townly was &s;urpri&s;ing indeed; &s;o much &s;o, that every one of the audience &s;poke to me with marks of attention, and an univer&s;al reque&s;t was made the next night, (the la&s;t of playing) that I would not only oblige them with Lady Townly, but &s;ome other part, to try my &s;kill in contra&s;t&mdash;for they were plea&s;ed to add, that every one was delighted; and tho&s;e phra&s;es are not to be wondered at as the &s;peeches of pa|rents and neighbours at a &s;chool play. I do not imagine any one night of real &s;ucce&s;s, when even attended with the <HI>pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">unia,</HI> ever gave me more ex|qui&s;ite plea&s;ure;&mdash;joy without mea&s;ure to feel my|&s;elf, on &s;uch a public occa&s;ion, the fir&s;t mark of attention, as a theatrical performer, at a place of &s;uch con&s;equence as Harrow School.</P>
<P>The reque&s;t of the additional performance the

en&s;uing play-night, (which had my &s;ecret and eager wi&s;hes of compliance) Dr. Thackerey not only a&s;&s;ented to, but gave his approbation. I, being attached to Mr. Barry's acting, fixed on the garden-&s;cene in Romeo and Juliet to pre|cede the Roman Father, and Lady Townly after the play. But here a difficulty &s;tarted, which was no le&s;s than the want of a Juliet; for though Mr. Frederick Thackerey had con|&s;ented to be Lord Townly, he would not &s;ub|mit to be my Juliet. This occa&s;ioned a demur; but Sir John Ru&s;&s;iate, on hearing of the ob&s;tacle, removed all inconvenience, by obligingly offering him&s;elf for Juliet, and this mighty matter was immediately concluded, and as &s;peedily put into practice; but as I did not &s;uppo&s;e a man of quali|ty could be &s;o good a performer as my&s;elf, I therefore, manager-like, taught Sir John &s;ome of Mrs. Cibber's &s;triking manner in the particular pa&s;&s;ages,&mdash;which did not a little add to my &s;elf-opinion. The third night fini&s;hed to the extent of my ambition&mdash;I <HI>looked, talked, walked,</HI> and <HI>felt</HI> my&s;elf a great actor.&mdash;Such Things Were! Such Things Are! and Such Things may be yet to come, as mu&s;t decide whether my play of life will end with, All in the Right, or All in the Wrong?

<P>I cannot quit Harrow for the Chri&s;tmas rece&s;s without recollecting that my &s;tage &s;ucce&s;s, as I then termed it, at that place, occa&s;ioned &s;erious reflections from the wi&s;e directors: For my exhibition (from the peculiarity of what I attempted) was the ground|work of public conver&s;ation in the circle of Harrow critics; it was therefore judged truly nece&s;&s;ary to con|vene a cabinet council, which was directly &s;ummoned, where it was agreed on mature deliberation, <HI>nemine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">tradicente,</HI> not in future to have any more plays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cted by the young gentlemen at Harrow School: The annual cu&s;tom was therefore aboli&s;hed, and I

am told that law has been &s;trictly adhered to from that time to this, as they feared it might get the appellation of (and an idle report be circulated in the world, that it was) a &s;chool for breeding up actors in lieu of &s;cholars. Though without doubt, &s;ince that period, private plays having been &s;o very fa&s;hionable, many changes of opinion mu&s;t have occurred for the improvement of that little &s;tate &s;ince my happy acting there in Dec. 1752&mdash;but I judge, had the ancient cu&s;tom been revived and tolerated, the new&s;papers or &s;ome chance intelligence would have before this fully informed me.

<P>I was received at home, as u&s;ual, with fondne&s;s and partiality even to a fault: If a&s;ked a que&s;tion relative to the progre&s;s I had made in my learning, I quickly an&s;wered it with relating the fine play we had performed, and that was &s;ufficient; but more &s;o, when I a&s;&s;ured them, I was the leading actor; and father and mother were &s;o plea&s;ed they determined Tate &s;hould not be di&s;appointed of his darling amu&s;ement.

<P>When the drum beat for marching orders to the camp at Harrow, I feigned &s;ickne&s;s very well; and by continuing at home I was at the height of bli&s;s. Mr. and Mrs. Reeves were, on account of their civilities to me at Harrow, con&s;tant vi&s;itors at my father's during the rece&s;s. Mr. Wier, gen|tleman to Sir Francis Delaval, was &s;mitten with my friend Mrs. Reeves's &s;i&s;ter, <HI>the La&s;s of the Hill;</HI> and Dr. Wilkin&s;on was appointed to per|form the holy rites.&mdash;I was father on the oc|ca&s;ion, and gave her away.&mdash;I remember it was a cheerful evening with us all; and a genteel &s;upper was ordered by Sir Francis Delaval, and &s;o ended the marriage with the u&s;ual ceremony.</P>
<P>My attention to the &s;tage was truly unremitting&mdash;it was my day&mdash;my life;&mdash;and it is not to be won|dered at that my imitations, when really produced on the &s;tage, were thought &s;uperior to Mr. Gar|rick's or Mr. Foote's: For tho&s;e particular actors and actre&s;&s;es, who&s;e manner and voice I &s;o &s;trongly pre&s;ented to the public, were taken on the true&s;t ground, that of feeling my&s;elf at the time the per&s;on I imitated, and not exaggerated into buf|foonery;&mdash;and this was my work, my toil, my con&s;tant practice for &s;ome years before I played in

Now, ex|cept Lady Townly, Lady Grace, and Mr. Manly (for I played all the parts) had each a different voice and manner, it did not plea&s;e the buildings of my fancy unle&s;s that I had performers &s;up|po&s;ed to be under my command, as thus:</P>

<P>I will put a &s;top for the pre&s;ent to Theatrical Anecdotes, as well as of my family and &s;elf and mu&s;t here intreat leave to introduce a little hi&s;tory of</P>
<P>LADY CORNWALLIS'S FATHER</P>
<P>a year before its real date, that it may not inter|vene too much with that part of my life, which on reflection, from that hour to my la&s;t, will be truly intere&s;ting to my feelings; and I doubt not, but it will claim and obtain the tear of pity. Among&s;t the variety of our acquaintance and vi&s;itors, my mother's mo&s;t con&s;tant intimate was a Mrs. Jones, wife of Captain James Jones, of his Maje&s;ty's third regiment of guards, who lived in the hou&s;e allotted for the &s;uperintendant officer in the Savoy-Square, and not above two hundred yards from ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> dwelling. As a private family hi&s;tory, this tale might be thought intruding, tire&s;ome, and impertinent; but when I announce Capt. James Jones as the father of the <HI>late Lady Cornwallis,</HI> I hope I &s;hall be permitted to proceed, and be honour|ed with attention; nor will his Lord&s;hip, I tru&s;t, be offended with any matter I &s;hall here in&s;ert; for I pronounce that it is the pen of Truth which writes this relation of all my various and hi&s;torical

<Q><L>Cur&s;t be the lines, howe'er &s;o well they flow,</L>
<L>If they but make one &s;ingle man my foe.</L></Q></P>
<P>At the time I give this &s;hort detail of change and chances in Life's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ickle dance, I mu&s;t notice I have been for many years thrown &s;o di&s;tant from my ancient friends and patrons, and my vi&s;its of late, when in London, were &s;o limited that I know not whether Mrs. Jones (mother-in-law to Lord Cornwallis) is living or dead. How|ever if that good Lady is now in our earthly re|gion, I take the liberty to mention that the ma|terial part, &s;uch as the grand change in Captain Jones's latter fortune, I had from her own lips, or rather my mother was honoured with the relation.</P>
<P>Captain Jones was of a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed turn of mind, to which was added every requi&s;ite to con&s;titute the true gentleman&mdash;a &s;trong under|&s;tanding, wit, vivacity, and genero&s;ity; his per&s;on well made, &s;mart, elegant, but not hand&s;ome. I cannot a&s;certain Capt. Jones and his Lady's mode and manners better than by referring the reader <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o Fielding's "Capt. Booth and his Amelia."
<PB N="59" REF="81">
I could &s;uppo&s;e Mrs. Jones the Amelia in every re&s;pect, and have my doubts whether Fielding did not take exact mea&s;ure, and actually founded that novel on his knowledge of tho&s;e two per|&s;ons&mdash;Nay, I could almo&s;t &s;wear it, for I never can believe that Captain Jones and his Lady would have been &s;o very complai&s;ant as to have &s;tudied their very foibles, and ru&s;h into &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, merely to imitate characters drawn by a noveli&s;t.</P>
<P>To the&s;e worthy per&s;ons the world was obli|ged for a &s;on and daughter.&mdash;The &s;on, Mr. James Jones, is &s;till living near Whitehaven, his e&s;tate being in that part of the kingdom: Mi&s;s Jones, the daughter, was, when a child, of a remarkably quick genius, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a theatrical turn; at eight years old could repeat all the &s;peeches of Juliet with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion, and her father's judgment and attention made her quite correct. But Dame Fortune will have her frolics, and like a naughty woman, makes no &s;cruple of introducing her daughter, <HI>Mi&s;s,</HI> on every occa&s;ion&mdash;Nay, &s;o abandoned is &s;he, that &s;he forces her into the wor&s;t as well as the be&s;t company; and what is truly lamentable, no living mortal will ever hear of her death, for the wicked jade will live and triumph, while the world is a world; and &s;he too often from her whims, by being an univer&s;al

plague, obliged Captain Jones to make the verge of the Court his mo&s;t frequented walks&mdash;and of cour&s;e, being often weary in body and mind in &s;uch walks of recreation and the reflections on this noon lounge, he would frequently &s;it down in a reverie on one of the benches in St. James's Park. Mrs. Chance (not her daughter) met him one morning, and &s;ugge&s;ted his re&s;ting him&s;elf on the &s;ame bench with General Skelton, who was then an entire &s;tranger to him, of an ill tempered moro&s;e turn, like old Rueful in the Natural Son. This happened often, and by the&s;e interviews and chit chat they of cour&s;e became mutually ac|quainted as Park-frequenters, to create an appetite for dinner, but no more; for the General never once a&s;ked him to his hou&s;e, or formed any fur|ther intercour&s;e. In the variety of ups and downs which Capt. Jones's &s;pirit and humour occa&s;ioned, that hydra-headed mon&s;ter Gaming, the origin of mo&s;t human ills, precipitately urged him to the brink of ruin. His affairs grew &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed, that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to have a &s;ecret retire|ment, about eight miles from the metropolis, near Mortlake upon the Thames; and by art and di&s;gui&s;e he found means to &s;ee his family: Some time elap&s;ed, when after a long ab&s;ence he was obliged to appear at St. James's;&mdash;being in a hurry to reach that place of royal protection, fearing

every in&s;tant a rude fi&s;ted bailiff, he was po&s;ting with the eyes of Argus to get within the &s;acred verge, when he was &s;uddenly called on by an audible voice, which he took to be that of an ac|quaintance. He did not wi&s;h to be near, therefore made the be&s;t of his way, the other continuing in full &s;peed after our Captain; fear did not add wings on this occa&s;ion, for he looked on this fa|tal demon as one that would &s;o far prove a de|vil, as to plunge him into ruin and irretrieveable di&s;tre&s;s. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to gain the wi&s;hed for a&s;ylum, he determined to face his enemy, and wheeled about as in a po&s;ture of defence.&mdash;This &s;hort pau&s;e &s;oon brought the parties to a &s;tate of parley. Jones, on looking &s;tedfa&s;tly on his &s;uppo&s;ed enemy, knew him to be a gentleman of the law and of reputation, therefore &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"What is the rea|&s;on, Sir, you hazard my re&s;entment, by treating me in this rude and contemptible manner?"&mdash;"Why," &s;ays the lawyer, "damn it, Jemmy! what are you afraid of?&mdash;I am Mr. Brown the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ttorney, and have had the plea&s;ure of knowing you for &s;ome time."&mdash;"True," &s;aid the Cap|tain, "but you are not at pre&s;ent one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant acquaintance I could wi&s;h to meet in my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances."</Q></P>

<P>Here the joy, the rapture of our captain may be imagined much ea&s;ier than expre&s;&s;ed, yet what follows will too fully prove how tran&s;itory are all human events, and the extraordinary fact plead, with the feeling heart, a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for my in&s;ertion of it.</P>
<P>Jones immediately, with his good genius the hone&s;t attorney, ha&s;tened to Mrs. Jones, and after the forms of nece&s;&s;ary preparation informed her of the glad tidings.&mdash;The fortunate Captain and his Lady went with Brown to view the New Palace in Henrietta Street; from which place her impa|tience made her elope to &s;ee her friend Mrs. Wil|kin&s;on in Little Bedford-Street, to inform her of the&s;e wonderful and delightful particulars.</P>

<P>The hou&s;e in Henrietta-Street, (after the &s;olemn and re&s;pectful interment of General Skelton) was &s;oon new decked; they remained there till the &s;ummer had made &s;ome approach, it was then judged nece&s;&s;ary on account of bu&s;ine&s;s, plea&s;ure, and inclination, to vi&s;it his e&s;tates, left by the

General, in Cumberland. The &s;on was at &s;chool, and the Captain, his Lady, and daughter, &s;et off with that kind of &s;elf-&s;atisfaction, which &s;uch a journey would naturally in&s;pire; they &s;afely arrived, and for about three weeks &s;eemed not only in an enchanted &s;pot, but a paradi&s;e; and, O delightful! that paradi&s;e their own. Unfortunately the Cap|tain wilfully, and again&s;t the per&s;ua&s;ion of his friends, would be let down to view a lead-mine, from which indeed he did return, but was in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;eized with a di&s;order of the mo&s;t malignant and fatal kind, which in a few days baffled all &s;kill, and he died in the arms of as &s;en&s;ible and endearing a wife as ever ble&s;&s;ed a hu&s;|band, or honoured the world. Her feelings on this occa&s;ion were poignant indeed; but by degrees her &s;trength of mind ro&s;e &s;uperior to her grief&mdash;her lo&s;s was great and irrevocable!

Mrs. Jones reflected, that though &s;he had lo&s;t her hu&s;|band, her protector; yet not many months be|fore had this melancholy event happened in her book of fate, &s;he had been left de&s;titute, without friends, or means of &s;upport; and that a &s;on and daughter, who would now attain rank and affluence, would then have been obliged to &s;ubmit for their

<P>Mrs. Jones's fir&s;t cares were employed in the further improvement of her daughter's education, adding every accompli&s;hment of art, to tho&s;e ble&s;|&s;ings Nature had be&s;towed, with a profu&s;e and bountiful hand on her darling child; a few years completed the plea&s;ing ta&s;k, when the mother in|troduced her bewitching and attractive daughter under her matron <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ing into the more elegant and poli&s;hed &s;cenes of life. Mrs. Jones was of a mo&s;t lively and entertaining di&s;po&s;ition; when once more returned to mix with the world, &s;he was willingly vi&s;ited by the gay, the good, and the great: among&s;t her round of acquaintance was the brave, the pre&s;ent Lord Cornwallis. He &s;oon felt an impre&s;&s;ion not to be effaced, by the fre|quent conver&s;ations he had the happine&s;s to enjoy with the lovely Mi&s;s Jones; nor was the young Lady le&s;s plea&s;ed with the great attention his Lord&s;hip honoured her with.

<P>When lo! the dreadful, the unfortunate war with America appeared! and to her Lady&s;hip in|deed a view of horror. His Lord&s;hip, though all the lover and affectionate hu&s;band, would not &s;uf|fer his honour to forget that he was a &s;oldier, and eager to hazard blood and life for his king and country, he entreated not to be an idle &s;pectator in the time of danger, if his &s;ervices could be ren|dered acceptable, which was immediately granted; and his Maje&s;ty conferred particular command and honors on his Lord&s;hip&mdash;who&s;e regiment was or|dered into immediate &s;ervice.

Lord Cornwallis's continued re&s;idence in England.

<P>The&s;e little anecdotes of the theatres I have merely given a place, to fill up the cha&s;m of my life from Chri&s;tmas 1752; nor would I have offered the&s;e notes here, as I intend a regular account of the &s;ucce&s;s of every performer, their &s;ea&s;ons, &amp;c. in a publication that will not only contain much information, but be of real &s;ervice to every young candidate for the &s;ock or bu&s;kin, whether lady or gentleman, with the terms, advantages, and di&s;|advantages, of all the principal play-hou&s;es, and circuits in the three kingdoms, and the particulars of my own theatres, from my commencing ma|nager to the pre&s;ent date; but without any idea of another &s;ub&s;cription: therefore this little &s;ketch is only done by way of &s;upply for my &s;amene&s;s of life till November 1756, being entirely at home.</P>
<P>In 1755, my father began the dreadful experi|ment of exerting his &s;uppo&s;ed rights as mini&s;ter o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Savoy; and my con&s;tant attendance at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> theatres was aided by a pocket full of money&punc; for &s;oon after the <HI>fatal</HI> Marriage Act (as I ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>truly</HI> term it) took place; my father judged h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> had a right to grant licences as u&s;ual; and that i was a privilege annexed to the Savoy, as bein extra-parochial.

<P>The famous Doctor Killigrew, who had been many years mini&s;ter of the Savoy, and all my father's predece&s;&s;ors had ever retained the power and right of granting licences for marrying from their own authority; and being extra-parochial, my father judged him&s;elf &s;ecure, and not within the reach of that &s;evere act.

Many per&s;ons came on a Sunday out of curio&s;ity to hear &s;uch a long li&s;t of &s;pin&s;ters an|nounced; all females of &s;pirit engaging for the public good. The Pari&s;ian dames were not le&s;s

<P>And&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Wi&s;ely and &s;low; they &s;tumble that run fa&s;t,"</Q> might have been my father's motto. Debts, that had been the plague of our hou&s;e were now almo&s;t unknown; and I mu&s;t &s;ay in ju&s;tice to Government, from my own knowledge, he had hints of the terrible con&s;equences that would cer|tainly en&s;ue, and they wi&s;hed him to drop a prac|tice that mu&s;t inevitably end in unavoidable ruin; he &s;uppo&s;ed tho&s;e hints proceeded from their fears of his undoubted right, and that was the real cau&s;e of their lenity, without keeping in mind, that had it been &s;o,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Might will overcome Right."</Q>&mdash;So it proved, for the laws were put into immediate execution.</P>
<P>There was then, and I &s;uppo&s;e there is &s;till, a regular walk over the leads at the Savoy, through the kitchen of the pri&s;on to a private door into the chapel, where the condemned de&s;erters were taken to hear &s;ervice the Sunday before they were to be &s;hot; and that road he took for the purpo&s;e of evading the King's me&s;&s;engers, &s;uppo&s;ed to be at times on the watch.

Mr. Vernon, of Drury-Lane Theatre, was at that time married by Mr. Grier&s;on, to Mi&s;s Poitier of the &s;ame &s;tage, and this circum&s;tance has occa&s;ioned a thou&s;and ill founded &s;tories.&mdash;We all know, &s;tories beget &s;tories; but then we <HI>make 'em,</HI> and <HI>when made</HI> we <HI>tell 'em.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Vernon was bani&s;hed the &s;tage by the au|dience in London as an informer, in Septem|ber 1756. The fact was &s;imply this&mdash;Mr. David Garrick ever loved to be meddling; and though the Marriage Act concerned him not half &s;o much as&mdash;whether the Emperor of Morocco's Sultana was the daughter of an Iri&s;h oy&s;ter wo|man or not;&mdash;yet &s;till he would be bu&s;y.&mdash;Mr. George Garrick, attorney at law, his brother, had wedded a daughter of Mr. Carrington's, the King's me&s;&s;enger, and lived at Somer&s;et Hou&s;e&punc; on hearing of Mr. Vernon's being married, he (Mr. George Garrick) judged it a glorious op|portunity to prove his vigilance, and Mr. Carring|ton's diligence in the &s;ervice of Government; therefore they &s;ummoned Mr. Vernon to appear, and to give King David a &s;atisfactory account of his marriage, as to the where and the when. For as to the tale of Vernon's being immediately after marriage tired of his Lady, it is merely a fictitious &s;tory.</P>

Infidelity was &s;o demon&s;trative on both &s;ides, that the archbi&s;hop's licence would have had very l <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tle force in tying fa&s;ter the marriage noo&s;e.&mdash;The lady liked a variety of hu&s;bands, and the gentleman a plurality of wives. They frequently changed their mates, till at la&s;t in Dublin, he became acquainted with Mi&s;s Macartney, who was well-bred, &s;en&s;ible, and hand&s;ome. She fixed the rambling rover, and with that amiable woman he lived happily, till death robbed the pub|lic of one, at lea&s;t, of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;ingers the &s;tage or Vauxhall could ever boa&s;t of.&mdash;He had a great advantage added to his ta&s;te and ex|pre&s;&s;ion as a &s;inger, as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed (what &s;eldom accompanies vocal performers) &s;trong abilities as an actor, which, aided by a plea&s;ing per&s;on gave united force to his performances on every occa|&s;ion. Mr. Vernon's a&s;&s;ertion as to his being really married at the Savoy to Mi&s;s Poitier, Mr. David Garrick affected not to believe; but a&s;ked, who married them&mdash;if it was Doctor Wilkin&s;on? Mr. Vernon, replied, <Q REND="inline">"No,&mdash;the clergyman's name was Grier&s;on."</Q>&mdash;Mr. David Garrick &s;till &s;eemed not convinced, but in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing the certificate, which Mr. Vernon immediately ob|tained from Mr. Grier&s;on, and gave it to Mr. David Garrick, who delivered it to Mr. Carring|ton; and Mr. Grier&s;on was, in con&s;equence, for|ced
<PB N="80" REF="102">
out of his lodgings in open day, and com|mitted to Newgate, tried, and condemned to tran&s;portation for fourteen years.&mdash;Mr. Vernon was &s;ubpoened to the trial, and was obliged to ap|pear when called on. Mr. Grier&s;on had a iarge family in great want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence&mdash;had no liv|ing, and nothing but the name of a poor cler|gyman for his &s;upport. In circum&s;tances &s;o de|&s;perate, he was glad to lay hold of any decent means for their &s;upport; and if the wor&s;t came to the wor&s;t, and the law &s;hould make a clergy|man's joining people in wedlock a crime, which for ages had been a ceremony held in the fir&s;t e&s;timation in the minds of men, why he would reconcile him&s;elf to the con&s;equence, well know|ing that whatever land he &s;hould be thrown upon it could not be wor&s;e than this. After he was &s;entenced a &s;ub&s;cription was rai&s;ed; but I have been informed he died on the voyage&mdash;his family were with him; but my knowledge of him was &s;o trifling, never having &s;een him except in tho&s;e few months, that he was engaged as the marrying clergyman at the Savoy, that it is not likely I &s;hould be fully acquainted with particulars relative to that unfortunate clergyman.</P>
<P>My father in the intervening &s;pace, &s;upplied by Grier&s;on, had &s;o arranged his matters, as in his opinion would carry all before the wind; it
<PB N="81" REF="103">
was not four weeks before he returned home. Mr. Brooks was his attorney, and the Reverend Mr. Brooks, brother to the attorney, who lately died at Norwich, was my father's curate for the pub|lic duties of the church. He was hu&s;band to Mrs. Brooks the authore&s;s who favoured the world with <HI>Ro&s;ina, Marian,</HI> &amp;c. A perpetual round of company went on, but the family &s;trong|pur&s;e was waining into a &s;udden decay with fea&s;t|ing the coun&s;ellors and lawyers who were to &s;up|port his cau&s;e; and one and all a&s;&s;ured him, over the flowing bowl, that victory was certain&mdash;but the event of war no mortal knows. Mr. Brooks being my father's officiate, an acquaintance with his family naturally occurred. Mrs. Brooks was his &s;econd wife&mdash;her mind was good, but her per|&s;on much the contrary&mdash;&s;he then had a literary turn, and her agreeable, &s;en&s;ible remarks, ob&s;er|vations, and in&s;tructions, were given with affabili|ty, and proved to me of great advantage.</P>
<P>At her hou&s;e I frequently met with Mr. Quin, who was u&s;ing his intere&s;t with Mr. Rich to pro|duce Mrs. Brooks's Tragedy of Virginia, which was very properly rejected, as it was not only a very poor play, but one on the &s;ame &s;ubject, by Crofts at Drury-Lane, and another by Moncrief at Covent-Garden, had been performed in 1753
<PB N="82" REF="104">
and 1754, and neither of them attended with &s;ucce&s;s; but Crofts's was by much the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Woffington and Mrs. Elmy were al&s;o her vi&s;itors. Mrs. Elmy knowing my inclination for the &s;tage, corrected many of my faults; her under&s;tanding was allowed by all to be very ex|ten&s;ive. She is &s;till living, and now mu&s;t be greatly in the vale of years; and I beg leave to a&s;&s;ure her, that where&s;oever &s;he dwells, I have not forgot her le&s;&s;ons on pronunciation, manners, and characters. Nor can her merit in Octavia, Lady Grace, or Mrs. Marwood, be ever erazed from my mind. Mrs. Cholmondley, &s;i&s;ter to Mrs. Woffington, was often there; but hearing I had dared at that time to imitate Mrs. Woffing|ton, Mrs. Brooks never had influence to get me into any degree of favour with either of tho&s;e ladies. I twice or thrice vi&s;ited Mrs. Woffing|ton, in York-buildings, with Dr. and Mrs. Brooks, but it was a forced civility in compliance to them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Woffington had conceived a di&s;gu&s;t not to be removed, and it was rooted even to hatred, as will hereafter appear. It mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that thirty years ago, mimicking of the performers had not been attempted at the theatres, except by Mr. Garrick, and that when he was at Goodman's Fields, and by Mr. Foote at the Hay-Market. For
<PB N="83" REF="105">
when Mr. Foote acted at Covent-Garden, he left out that part of his performance, and the Hay-Market was the &s;pot for him to be the hero of each tale, and where he &s;hone in a con&s;picuous light to every advantage. His mimickry at Covent-Gar|den, con&s;i&s;ted of a whim&s;ical teaching of &s;tage pupils, the Puppets&mdash;the Chevalier Taylor and a Doctor Heberden, two very public characters, and well known by every body.</P>
<P>I was the fir&s;t that ever gave an entertainment of that kind at Drury-Lane or Covent-Garden Theatres; &s;ince which, it has been &s;o often well and ill attempted, that though the actors and actre&s;&s;es naturally do not approve of the practice, nor admire the talents of &s;uch an exhibitor, yet it does not by any means create the &s;pleen and unhappine&s;s it did formerly; for the frequent ex|ertion of &s;uch comic powers certainly have taken off that edge, which thirty years ago was judged mo&s;t cutting, and not to be endured. The pecu|liarities of Mr. Delane, an actor of the fir&s;t rank, were &s;o &s;everely pointed out by Mr. Garrick, in the character of Bayes, that it is &s;aid to have ac|tually occa&s;ioned Mr. Delane's flying to the bottle for relief to his hurt mind; he continued to u&s;e it with &s;uch exce&s;s that he never was him&s;elf again.<Q><L>In other men we faults can &s;py,</L>

<L>To our own &s;tronger errors blind."</L></Q> Mr. Delane is mentioned as a gentleman of fa|mily in Ireland, of liberal education, and great qualifications for the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick at the &s;ollicitation of his friends&mdash;remon&s;trances of the actors, (without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance he could not live, for what avails a general without an army,) and from full conviction his own merit required not &s;uch aid as mimickry, as it was merely a trifling feather in his cap of fame; he, for once in his life did a generous action, and gave up what he no longer wanted.</P>
<P>But to return again to my father, who was at home fairing mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly every day on the gleanings of the marriage harve&s;t, but with very little attention or anxiety paid to the evil hour; and I was in my glory, full of fea&s;ting, company, per&s;onating a hero at night in my own play-hou&s;e, or vi&s;iting one of the theatres, and &s;ometimes both. If I did reflect, it was very briefly&mdash;I argued thus, that if the wor&s;t &s;hould happen, I could be a great a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">or in time, and did not doubt but that I &s;hould be a manager in reality&mdash;<Q><L>O glorious thought, I did enjoy it,</L>

<P>My father having per&s;i&s;ted in the pur&s;uit of his
<PB N="85" REF="107">
golden vi&s;ion, and being of an intrepid &s;pirit, and, as he thought, &s;ecure of victory on the day of trial. The week previous to it, in July 1756, he vi&s;ited &s;everal of his friends, and on the Sunday evening, attended by two or three of his intimates, took an affectionate leave of my mother and my&s;elf, and delivered him&s;elf up at Newgate, as he had given notice, that he was ready to abide trial the next &s;e&s;&s;ions, which was to begin on the Mon|day following; and on the Friday in the &s;ame week came on his dreadful day&mdash;a dreadful day indeed was it to my di&s;con&s;olate mother, who&s;e features indicated a mind replete with woe. The trial of my father was not a &s;cene for me to be pre&s;ent at; but I remember to have heard he urged, in his defence, that he, <Q REND="inline">"had been pur&s;ued with unrelenting vengeance."</Q></P>
<P>As he was chaplain to his Maje&s;ty, had they been determined on no other act of &s;everity, they certainly for his ho&s;tile demeanor in defiance of Government, would have taken his place of chap|lain from him. However it is too well known, whatever he might think as to his rights and privile|ges, that the court found him guilty of the offence; and it is as well known, that though the public at large wi&s;hed him well, and dete&s;ted the act in force, yet mo&s;t of his rea&s;onable friends thought he would at la&s;t &s;uffer the con&s;equences announced
<PB N="86" REF="108">
by law, by which he was &s;entenced to fourteen years tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>This was a &s;troke he mo&s;t &s;everely felt, for it &s;truck at his affections, his pride, and his fal&s;e de|pendence, which was the mo&s;t mortifying of all: for the condolence of what we &s;uffer from con&s;e|quent effects and cau&s;es, clears in &s;ome degree the rugged paths of Misfortune; but what our own wi&s;dom fails in, when in oppo&s;ition to the opinion of wi&s;er heads, makes the di&s;appointment terribly mortifying&mdash;and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing indeed!&mdash;The general or admiral, who on a great undertaking does not prove victor, however able in judgment and valour, &s;eldom or ever e&s;capes cen&s;ure. My father therefore fell an unfortunate victim to the memorable Marriage Act. His pur&s;e was drained to the la&s;t for the purcha&s;e of being promi&s;e-crammed by the alluring and flattering hopes given him by the gentlemen of the law.</P>
<P>It now became an act of nece&s;&s;ity for the pub|lic and his friends to be &s;tretched to the extent of their humanity, to equip and &s;upport him as a gentleman for his voyage to America. His con|nections were con&s;iderable, con&s;equently his re|commendations were &s;uch, as would doubtle&s;s have placed him in a light of admiration as a man of the go&s;pel, had he arrived and lived in that country. His qualifications as a &s;cholar, and as

It was after &s;ome con&s;ultation determined, as &s;oon as he was well and happily &s;ituated in America, that my mother and my&s;elf &s;hould go after him.</P>
<P>The following petition, which I now pre&s;ent to the reader from his own hand writing, was deli|vered by my mother her&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty King George the Second, but without effect or notice.

<P>When the Marriage Act took place in 1754, the Duchy of the Savoy certainly was in a lawle&s;s &s;tate, as acts of parliament have pa&s;&s;ed within the&s;e fif|teen years to put it under the power of Govern|ment. I recollect &s;everal in&s;tances&mdash;two will ex|plain as well as five hundred. From the Savoy|&s;teps in the Strand, on to Duchy-Lane, which is the <HI>la&s;t</HI> turning before you come to Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e, down to the water-&s;ide, and next the water on to Somer&s;et-&s;tairs, (that u&s;ed to be for water|men) is all the Savoy precincts. I remember that a Mr. Wood, a timber-merchant, purcha&s;ed the hou&s;e next door to ours, near the Savoy water|gate, and placed in it one Pugh, who belonged to
<PB N="93" REF="115">
Covent-Garden Theatre, to take care of it, but Wood neglecting at the time to put furniture into the premi&s;es; when he (Wood) wanted his hou&s;e, Pugh not only refu&s;ed, but kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it for him&s;elf, and Wood could not get any remedy at law. The rea&s;on I do &s;uppo&s;e was, that no ori|ginal right could be proved by him. Pugh after living in this hou&s;e for &s;ome years, &s;old it to one Meredith, a Welchman; and Taffy well know|ing how to turn the penny, even &s;tripped the lead off the roof of the hou&s;e, which he afterwards covered with boards, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">arred them over. The lead I believe was the property of Government, for it reached over that, a part of my father's hou&s;e, and &s;ome of the Savoy pri&s;on.</P>
<P>A man who&s;e name was Waller, kept a public hou&s;e near the Savoy-&s;quare; he heard of a hou&s;e being empty next the Savoy water-gate, where Mrs. Porter, a celebrated actre&s;s in Cibber's time had lived. The hou&s;e had been left, and &s;tripped of all the furniture.&mdash;Breaking a lock was a &s;er|vice of danger; therefore this Waller, who kept the &s;uttling-hou&s;e near the barracks, with a ladder fixed again&s;t it from a lighter, mounted and got in with ea&s;e at the old balcony, and by the &s;ame means in the might, conveyed chairs, &amp;c. into the hou&s;e; took off the lock on the in&s;ide, and became &s;o dexterous thereby, as to be firm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y e&s;tabli&s;hed in

<P>Waller was &s;till more lucky&mdash;for one Burdet, a very rich old German, I dare &s;ay near eighty years of age, who walked the &s;treets in rags, and was a picture of mi&s;ery equal to Otway's Witch, for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his eyes with burning rheum were &s;cald and red, and went about picking up dry &s;ticks and mumbling"</Q>&mdash;would not allow him&s;elf the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life&mdash;was filthy in every &s;en&s;e of the word.

Mrs. Barrington replied, that the young man was &s;aying, that Lady Dainty looked beautiful that night, and added, &s;he had told him, there needed not that information, as &s;he always looked &s;o.&mdash;Mrs. Woffington viewing me di&s;dainfully, cried, Poor Creature!&mdash;O God! &s;ays I, what &s;hall I do for bread!&mdash;I had better exhibit in a barn, but am not &s;ure if I can even get that &s;ituation.&mdash;My only com|fort was my acquaintance with the facetious Ned Shuter; it grew &s;oon to a &s;trong friend&s;hip, for he took me to all his parties, and that made my time glide more plea&s;antly. I mentioned his kind|ne&s;s to my confidant Captain Forbes; and al&s;o in|formed him what excellent company Shuter was&mdash;He &s;aid he looked upon his civility &s;hewn to me as an obligation to him&s;elf. He was then appointed on the command of the Savoy Guard, and he de|&s;ired&punc; I would con&s;tantly be with him, and pre&s;ent a general invitation to Mr. Shuter; the compli|ment Shuter &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with, accepted
<PB N="111" REF="133">
of the favour offered him, and went with me there very often.</P>
<P>We had many plea&s;ant parties; Captain Forbes and Shuter grew very intimate. Shuter's talents were wonderfully &s;hrewd, quick, &s;en&s;ible, and to a degree highly entertaining.&mdash;He was no man's enemy but his own. One evening over our bottle Shuter told me, that his benefit was to be on the 28th of March, and he would <HI>get up</HI> (never per|formed at Covent-Garden) the farce of Lethe, and would play Mr. Garrick's character of Lord Chalk&s;tone; and I &s;hould repre&s;ent the Fine Gen|tleman, a difficult part for any actor, and at that time playing by Woodward at Drury-Lane, who was in his zenith, and was certainly the mo&s;t im|proper character for <HI>me</HI> of any in the whole round of the drama. But mo&s;t young actors think if it be a principal one, the bu&s;ine&s;s is done; for it is a rule fixed in the theatrical corps, that parts make the actor&mdash;not the actor the parts. They will al&s;o urge, that managers can always by &s;uch partial means and &s;ubterfuge create as many great per|formers as they plea&s;e; but a very little reflection would evidently contradict it, to the mortification of mo&s;t of them; becau&s;e at that rate, the lo&s;s of a grand actor or actre&s;s could always be &s;upplied by the managers: &s;o, if their doctrine be true, the favourites of the public &s;hould not at any place
<PB N="112" REF="134">
trifle with the manager, as according to that &s;up|po&s;ition, the performer may fooli&s;hly and wan|tonly quit a good &s;ituation, and the manager from his own creative quality, as the carpenter of genius, could mould and chi&s;el any block to &s;upply &s;uch a lo&s;s; but true genius will &s;hew it&s;elf in the flighte&s;t character. Nor did Shake&s;pear ever write a We&s;tmoreland or Northumberland, without &s;trict attention to their true quality. Now and then actors, nay, even the ladies, mi&s;take their ta|talents; nor was Mr. Garrick exempt, who acted Lord Townly and Sir Harry Wildair, Othello, Lord Foppington, Pierre, &amp;c. all unfit for him, and they were judged &s;o by the Town.&mdash;Mr. Mo&s;&s;op, the We&s;t Indian; Mr. Ryan, Varanes; Mrs. Cibber, Lady Townly and Lady Brute; Mr. Barry, Richard; Mrs. Clive, Zara; Quin, Cha|mont and Young Bevil, and all this by their own choice; therefore, if &s;uch per&s;ons of judgment and experience were led away by their performing characters unfit for them, it is not to be won|dered at that I, young and inexperienced, &s;hould attempt the Fine Gentleman.</P>
<P>However, adverti&s;ed for it I was; and away went Shuter and my&s;elf to Monmouth Street, where for two guineas, I was equipped with the loan of a heavy, rich, glaring, &s;pangled, embroidered velvet &s;uit of clothes, and in this full dre&s;s, fit for the King

in Hamlet, with my hair in papers, did I advance with timid &s;teps, through crowds of people; for Shuter's popularity had brought the whole Lon|don world. A large amphitheatre was built on the &s;tage, numbers were lying on the ground; and only one entrance on each &s;ide to get on the &s;tage, and that was with great difficulty obtained; however at la&s;t I was produced on the centre of Covent-Garden boards as a performer&mdash;and, O grief of griefs! as a <HI>Fine Gentleman!</HI>&mdash;A great number of my late father's friends were a&s;&s;em|bled. The prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of his &s;uffer|ings&mdash;the public clamour, and pity of the audi|ence on my known de&s;titute &s;ituation, gained me &s;uch a reception as might have mi&s;led a wi&s;er head than mine; as audiences every where, but at Lon|don in particular, are ever con&s;iderate and en|couraging to a young performer. I do not mean to in&s;inuate here that I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Promethean heat, but it gave me courage to proceed; for it was a perpetual applau&s;e. I endeavoured to copy Woodward, but with aukwardne&s;s, and having no knowledge of the &s;tage, &amp;c. it certainly was a dreadful performance; not, but that &s;ome of my friends thought, from the great approbation that was given, and having no opinion of their own, I had done wonders.</P>
<P>I was &s;o highly &s;atisfied with my&s;elf, that as &s;oon
<PB N="114" REF="136">
as the &s;cene was over, and not having patience to wait till I was &s;ummoned with the other characters by Mercury at the end of the farce, I took a chair to Mrs. Town&s;end's, where my mother was &s;it|ting, and entered among&s;t the a&s;toni&s;hed circle of old ladies a&s;&s;embled together&mdash;all glittering with my fine dre&s;s, and quite elevated with the ap|plau&s;e and my own conceit, my&s;elf being the har|binger of the joyful news. The partial mother &s;eeing her &s;on &s;o fine, and fully per&s;uaded he had acted well, could not re&s;train the gli&s;tening tear, no doubt progno&s;ticating in her mind, that &s;he beheld in her offspring a &s;econd Garrick&mdash;My ig|norance was &s;o great that I had intended al&s;o to have obliged the town with the Frenchman, in the &s;ame farce, but was luckily per&s;uaded from it, for if that had really happened, it mu&s;t not only have deprived me of that happy night, but have made it one of horror, and irretrievable damna|tion.</P>
<P>Friday, April the 19th, was fixed for the bene|fit of Mr. Bencraft, and Mr. Co&s;tollo, at Covent-Garden; the play was Alexander, and the part of Alexander, by Mr. Barry; they applied to me for to &s;tudy Don Quixote in England, and I readily agreed to it; but thanks for once to my &s;tupidity, I was under the nece&s;&s;ity of giving it up, as I could not by any means drive the words into my
<PB N="115" REF="137">
pate, and if I had, it mu&s;t have proved an unfor|tunate attempt; therefore that Quixote &s;cheme being abandoned, Lethe was again &s;ub&s;tituted, and they reque&s;ted of me to act the Fine Gentle|man, which I con&s;ented to; not but that I in|wardly thought <HI>my</HI> Alexander would have done as much for their intere&s;t as Mr. Barry's. How|ever as that was not their opinion, why, hey for the river Styx once more! and I &s;urely that night needed a draught of Lethean waters to forget my cares.</P>
<P>A dre&s;s was to &s;eek; for Bencraft and Co&s;tollo would not pay &s;o extravagantly as Shuter had, for the hire of the grand velvet &s;uit; therefore the wardrobe of the theatre was to furni&s;h me: but all the decent modern clothes were appropriated to the principal actors; and on in&s;pecting the grand repo&s;itory, Mr. Whitfield the wardrobe-keeper, produced a very &s;hort old &s;uit of clothes, with a black velvet ground, and broad gold flowers, as dingy as the twenty four letters on a piece of gild|ed gingerbread&mdash;this apparel had not been brought t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">t &s;ince the fir&s;t year Garrick played Lothario, at that theatre in 1746; when Quin acted Horatio, which was the la&s;t character that he performed, in the la&s;t week of May 1751, as an engaged actor, though he played twice after that his favourite character of Fal&s;taff, for his friend Ryan's benefits, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">52 and 1753.</P>

The &s;uit being Garrick's, I with eagerne&s;s &s;natched at it.

<P>So my dear, agreeable Mi&s;s Farren, for the pre&s;ent adieu&mdash;and now let me inform the reader, that on the night of Mrs. Woffington's fatal illne&s;s, Mr. Wignell, an under actor at Covent-Garden, was enli&s;ting troops to form a party at Maid&s;tone in Kent, where it was &s;aid there had not been a com|pany of comedians for &s;ome years; and that one from London would of cour&s;e do wonders. I a&s;ked Mrs. Barrington to intercede for me, but &s;he refu&s;ed any interference; I therefore waited on Mr. Wignell, who told me, he was erecting a wooden booth at Maid&s;tone, and that Mr. and Mrs. Barrington, who u&s;ually went to Bri&s;tol, were di&s;appointed that year on account of &s;ome di&s;pute with the mayor, and he &s;hould find in them (his cou&s;ins) a tower of &s;trength.</P>
<P>Mr. Barrington, was not a very good comedian; but yet was in low Iri&s;hmen, (Mr. Moody indeed excepted) the be&s;t I ever &s;aw&mdash;&s;uch as the Teagues, in the Committee, Twin Rivals, &amp;c. but would have been a bad Major O'Flaharty, as he was in

fact a very indifferent Sir Callaghan. Mi&s;s Hal|lam was to be there, niece to Mrs. Barrington, and had been bred under her with the utmo&s;t care and reared to be an accompli&s;hed actre&s;s, as the reader will allow, when I announce that Mi&s;s Hallam is the pre&s;ent Mrs. Mattocks; for whom I have, and &s;hall ever retain the highe&s;t re|gard; and am indebted to both Mr. and Mrs. Mattocks, for repeated acts of kindne&s;s and friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>I was, from the emergency of Mr. Wignell's company not being filled, to my delight accepted as a &s;harer, and enrolled one of their common|wealth. The performers collected for this Ken|ti&s;h expedition were&mdash;Mr. Wignell, Mr. Barring|ton, Mr. Morgan, Mr. Smith, Mr. Haughton, Mr. Clough, Mr. Jones, Mr. Wilkin&s;on, Mr. Buck, Mr. Ca&s;tle;&mdash;Mrs. Barrington, Mi&s;s Mor|ri&s;on (now Mrs. Hull), Mi&s;s Brad&s;haw, Mrs. Roberts, Mrs. Wignell, Mrs. Haughton, and Mi&s;s Hallam.</P>
<P>I got home, and judged that I had for once done &s;omething like a tran&s;action of bu&s;ine&s;s; and al&s;o found I had the intere&s;t of a great friend of my mother's, who I have the honour at this day to call a relation, and to whom I am and have been greatly obliged;&mdash;the Lady's name was Wardale, &s;he lived at Carli&s;le. To tho&s;e who
<PB N="125" REF="147">
knew her, I need not add prai&s;e; tho&s;e who did not, may regret that they had not the plea&s;ure of being acquainted with &s;uch an agreeable, &s;en&s;ible, well bred woman.</P>
<P>This Mrs. Wardale, anxious for my &s;ituation and welfare, had prevailed on the Honourable Mi&s;s Foley, &s;i&s;ter to Lord Foley, to a&s;k the fa|vour of a letter of recommendation from her inti|mate friend, Lord Mansfield, to Mr. Garrick; which his Lord&s;hip immediately complied with: &s;o with tho&s;e credentials I was to proceed on a vi|&s;it the next day, and which I a&s;&s;ure the reader &s;eemed to me to require more than common for|titude. I marched up and down Southampton &s;treet three or four times before I dared rap at this great man's door, as fearing in&s;tant di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion might follow; or what appeared to me al|mo&s;t as dreadful, if graciou&s;ly admitted, how I &s;hould be able to walk, move, or &s;peak before him. However the rap was at la&s;t given, and the deed was done pa&s;t all retreating.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Is Mr. Gar|rick at home?"&mdash;"Yes."</Q>&mdash;Then delivering the letter from Mi&s;s Foley, with an enclo&s;ed one from Lord Mansfield, and after waiting in a parlour for about ten minutes, I was ordered to approach. Mr. Garrick glanced his &s;crutinizing eye fir&s;t at me, then at the letter, and &s;o alternately; at la&s;t&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Well, Sir&mdash;Hey!&mdash;What, now you are a &s;tage

candidate? Well, Sir, let me have a ta&s;te of your quality."</Q>&mdash;I, di&s;tilled almo&s;t to jelly with my fear, attempted a &s;peech from Richard, and ano|ther from E&s;&s;ex; which he encouraged, by ob|&s;erving, I was &s;o much frightened, that he could not form any judgment of my abilities; but a&s;|&s;ured me, it was not a bad omen, as fear was by no means a &s;ign of want of merit, but often the contrary. We then chatted for a few minutes, and I felt my&s;elf more ea&s;y, and reque&s;ted leave to repeat a few &s;peeches in imitation of the then principal &s;tage repre&s;entatives. <Q REND="inline">"Nay&mdash;now," &s;ays Garrick, "Sir, you mu&s;t take care of this, for I u&s;ed to call my&s;elf the fir&s;t at this bu&s;ine&s;s."</Q>&mdash;I luckily began with an imitation of Foote. It is difficult here to determine whether Garrick hated or feared Foote the mo&s;t; &s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes the other was predominant; but from the attention of a few minutes, his looks bright|ened&mdash;the glow of his countenance transfu&s;ed to mine, and he eagerly de&s;ired a repetition of the &s;ame &s;peech.

<P>In a week my expedition to Maid&s;tone com|menced. My mother with much difficulty equip|ped me with five guineas; Capt.

<P>I &s;tepped into the Grave&s;end boat, and for one &s;hilling, &s;ailed with a fair wind, and arrived at the end of my voyage &s;afe, (but &s;ick) and from Grave&s;end a &s;tage-coach conveyed me to Cha|them, and the next day in a chai&s;e I arrived at Maid&s;tone. It &s;eemed to me a very long journey, for going once with my father to Sheerne&s;s, when about the age of fourteen, (on &s;ome election bu|&s;ine&s;s for a Mr. Taffe of Ireland) was my extent of travelling; and Richmond, Hampton Court, and Greenwich, what I called going into the country; and Cockney-like, thought my being once with Captain Forbes to Wind&s;or, a tedi|ous journey. The country about Maid&s;tone &s;eemed delightful, but now it is almo&s;t pa&s;t my remembrance.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick had, unknown to me, &s;poke to

Mi&s;s Brad&s;haw, then of his theatre, (but now no more) to keep me as much as po&s;&s;ible under pet|ticoat government, and to be one of her party at tea, cards, &amp;c. and to ob&s;erve how I went on, and to &s;end him <HI>minute</HI> information.

If riches immen&s;e could be added to her other good qualities, my prai&s;e here would not be neglected, but read with plea|&s;ure.

<P>We opened at Maid&s;tone with the Beaux Stratagem.&mdash;Archer, Mr. Wignell; Aimwell, Mr. Wilkin&s;on; Foigard, Mr. Barrington; Dorinda,

The little motley troop from London certainly de&s;erved more attention and encouragement than was be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Barrington had an excellent wardrobe of her own; and being the intimate of Mrs. Wof|fington, had the entire trea&s;ure of her tragedy jewels, which at that time Mrs. Barrington eyed as her own property, by having nine parts of the law in her favour&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Her royal train &s;hould alone have been &s;ufficient to have allured the country Bumpkins. Added to the tragedy dia|monds, Mr. and Mrs. Barrington amazed the eyes and ears of the little &s;treets with a very hand&s;ome one-hor&s;e chair, and every noon took a genteel airing; they were well-bred, &s;en&s;ible, and behaved properly to every body there; living with oeconomy and every decency, which could cau&s;e them to be e&s;teemed and re&s;pected, and were a credit to their profe&s;&s;ion. Our hou&s;es were &s;hockingly attended, though even I, was the Ro|meo, Barnwell, Shore, Ore&s;tes, and the Douglas. In Douglas, (without a joke) I was very well re|ceived; but not even my Ore&s;tes, nor Mrs. Bar|rington's

Andromache, could attract a &s;ufficient audience. Tho&s;e who attended we were obliged to di&s;mi&s;s from our booth.

If the performers do not approve of the parts allotted them, they will again&s;t ob&s;ervation, decency, and common &s;en&s;e, ever take pains to be ridiculous, rude, and ab&s;urd, by which behaviour they are certain every judici|ous thinking &s;pectator, be&s;tows the cen&s;ure on them which &s;uch conduct de&s;erves&mdash;be it in a village, a barn, or theatre.</P>
<P>A performer will never convert an audience to the belief, of finding him worthy of being tru&s;ted with a thou&s;and lines, if he does not &s;peak <HI>&s;ix</HI> with great care, attention and propriety. What leads actors in &s;ome mea&s;ure into this unfortunate and ill-conceived practice for their future welfare, is li&s;tening to idle, di&s;&s;ipated companions, who too often are termed their friends, and encourage them in &s;uch behaviour, while they are laughing on the &s;tage, becau&s;e they do not know three lines of their damned parts, as they term them; and

<P>Mr. Quin had wit, genero&s;ity, and a &s;trong un|der&s;tanding, and by never forgetting his own dig|nity, he was never forgot by others: He obtained the re&s;pect and e&s;teem of all; his death was as much lamented by all ranks at Bath, where he re&s;ided, as if the fir&s;t man of quality there had de|parted this life, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame good

<P>The conver&s;ation the next day, particularly of all my eager partial friends, was an univer&s;al cry of <Q REND="inline">"Foote outdone!

been in their wi&s;hes for my welfare, but trembled for the event; they felt unhappy le&s;t I &s;hould make a de&s;picable attempt, and be univer&s;ally di&s;|approved; and then reflected within them&s;elves, <Q REND="inline">"Good Heaven! what is to become of this poor youth? what can he do for a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence?"</Q> After my performance, from the &s;ucce&s;s I had met with, I could neither eat, drink, or &s;leep, that night; plea&s;ant dreams I needed not; my waking thoughts were &s;o much &s;uperior.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tea</HI> was acted in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;everal nights, nay, it was commanded by the Duke and Duche&s;s of Bedford; his Grace was at that time Lord Lieutenant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rehear&s;al</HI> was repeated, in which I per|formed the Prince&s;s Chloris.

Let it be here con&s;idered that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">itation was univer&s;ally felt above and below, as Mrs. Woffington lad played three years in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> her &s;alary not le&s;s than 800<HI>l. per</HI> &s;ea&s;on, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> benefits.

more public, it all ended in the de&s;truction of the theatre, and the bani&s;hment of the manager, who relied on &s;omething better, and &s;ecretly expected from courtiers' promi&s;es that his greatne&s;s would ri&s;e from his de&s;truction.&mdash;But plays (without his own learning) might have taught him better.&mdash;Alas&punc; who wants not teaching?</P>
<P>Mrs Woffington being &s;o well known to all ranks and degrees, was of infinite a&s;&s;i&s;tance to me as an imitator. After the fir&s;t night of my per|formance, Mr. Sheridan appointed me a &s;alary of three guineas per week, and reque&s;ted, with my approbation, (which was readily obtained) that Mr. Foote would write to Mr. Garrick to grant permi&s;&s;ion for my continuance in Dublin till the end of February. Foote was oblige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to go to England with all &s;peed, as he had &s;taid beyond his time; but I was left behind, waiting for Mr. Garrick's an&s;wer to Mr. Sheridan's reque&s;t, but which &s;oon arrived, and granted the petition re|que&s;ted by Mr. Foote.</P>
<P>Before January expired, I played Cadwallader, &s;poke the prologue, and acted Othello with much applau&s;e and credit to my&s;elf, the latter was certainly a very bold attempt; for, by the bye, Barry had performed that, his favourite cha|racter, repeatedly two winters before, Mr. King performed Iago, and Mi&s;s G. Philips (Mrs. Jor|dan's mother) De&s;demona. Here it would be

unju&s;t and ungrateful in me not to reflect with plea&s;ure on the great civilities and kindne&s;&s;es which I received from Mr. and Mrs. King in that early &s;tage of life. There are different kinds of memories; a good memory, a bad memory, and a convenient memory. What I am going to re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elate requires a bad memory, as not proper to be retained; but I in&s;ert it to plea&s;e my&s;elf; and be|ing a <HI>&s;weet</HI> &s;tory, will with it refre&s;h the memory of my friend Mr. King.</P>
<P>This &s;aid Mr. Thomas King had &s;et his heart on well preparing a new pantomime, in order to give his manager (Mr. Sheridan) a lift, and it was adverti&s;ed for the Thur&s;day, but it was not fit for preparation on the Wedne&s;day. It was called the Whim, or Harlequin Villager. As Mr. King is, and ever was, indefatigable, he was de|termined to be at the theatre the whole Wedne&s;|day night, that he might be a &s;pur to indu&s;try, and ob&s;erve, that the painters, carpenters, &amp;c. were &s;trictly at their duty; and to make the time pa&s;s more plea&s;antly in his dreary man&s;ion, (for a large theatre certainly is &s;o, when only lighted with three or four pieces of candle, and being a &s;pot where murders of various kinds are weekly committed, and where gho&s;ts undoubtedly are known to &s;talk) he therefore, to cheer his &s;pirits, de&s;ired Mrs. King and my&s;elf to be with him

in the green-room; we agreed, but I made it conditional, which was, provided we had &s;ome|thing to eat as well as to drink, as mutton-chops or beef-&s;teaks. He a&s;&s;ented, and Mrs. King agreed to cook them, and I was to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. About ten o'clock, wine, rum, and oranges, en|tered the room, and the mutton-chops, properly &s;prinkled with pepper and &s;alt, were placed in or|der on the well-rubbed gridiron, which a &s;er|vant &s;et clo&s;e to the fender, waiting for further orders.

<P>It had not at this time been u&s;ual to have plays acted on Saturday nights, as they never had turned out beneficial or fa&s;hionable, though put into practice, when Woodward and Barry opened at Crow-&s;treet, and from u&s;e &s;oon became as good a night as any other for the manager, but not I believe to this day as a benefit.&mdash;The prevalence of cu&s;tom is a&s;troni&s;hing&mdash;a Lady in London will go to a known bad opera on the Saturday, and though &s;he profe&s;&s;es being an amateur in mu&s;ic will not go on the Tue&s;day, though a good opera, becau&s;e it <HI>is</HI> Tue&s;day.

<P>I am led to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, by recollecting, when in Dublin, on this my fir&s;t excur&s;ion, I judged it nece&s;&s;ary, early in February, to wait upon Mr. Sheridan, in order to appoint a night for my benefit, which had been &s;tipulated to be in that month, in con&s;equence of my continuing with him. Mr. Sheridan ob&s;erved, that my be|ing a young man and a &s;tranger, it could never an&s;wer for me, to venture on the expences of the theatre, the charge being forty pounds (but at pre&s;ent, &s;ixty or &s;eventy pounds per night). But he had an expedient to &s;erve me more effectually, which was, to permit me the privilege of di&s;po|&s;ing of tickets, dividing the &s;um taken for tho&s;e tickets between us; and he would him&s;elf play, and &s;ecure its being &s;erviceable to me. In fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t, this &s;ecret &s;ervice of his playing, he thought would make my &s;trenuous friends pour in tickets, and he

That argument &s;eemed with Mr. Sheridan, to have but little weight; he per&s;i&s;ted angrily. I then in|timated, that if I complied, I hoped he would not have any objection to my u&s;ing his name, and that I did not do it of my own accord, but had his ex|pre&s;s command for that purpo&s;e; and further urged, Surely, Sir, will they not think it unkind of the manager, that he &s;hould order a &s;atirical performance on them, which they mu&s;t feel and term a cruelty in their governor to inflict? Mr. Sheridan &s;eemed much vexed; &s;aid, that what he had a&s;ked me to do, was to get me ap|plau&s;e, and to &s;erve <HI>me</HI>&mdash;not <HI>him&s;elf;</HI> but he &s;hould by no means con&s;ent to my expo&s;ing the peculiarities of his actors and actre&s;&s;es, under the &s;anction of his de&s;ire and approbation; he wi&s;hed it to come before the audience as a &s;udden &s;ur|pri&s;e, and as my own voluntary act, and after that had been done, he would have taken care to have had it &s;o called for by the audience, as to prevent a po&s;&s;ibility of the performers' anger, being of weight &s;ufficient to prevent its repetition; and the more it vexed the actors and actre&s;&s;es, the greater
<PB N="187" REF="209">
reli&s;h it would give the audience; that I believe was too true.</P>
<P>However, I continued my objection, but at la&s;t (like a fool in the knowledge of mankind and the human heart) a lucky bright thought, as I judged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r&punc; occurred to me; and I &s;aid, my good Mr. Sheridan, I have hit upon the very thing to e&s;ta|bli&s;h my&s;elf as a favourite with you, and the town. He &s;eemed all impatience to know what it could be. My dear Sir, a thought has ju&s;t entered my pate, which I think will draw money, and be of infinite &s;ervice to my&s;elf. What is it! What is it! &s;ays Sheridan, with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s.&mdash;Why, Sir, &s;ays I, your rank in the theatre, and a gentleman &s;o well known in Dublin, on and off the &s;tage, mu&s;t naturally occa&s;ion any &s;triking imi|tation of your&s;elf, to have a wonderful effect. I have paid great attention to your whole mode of acting, not only &s;ince I have been in Dublin; but two years before, when you played the whole &s;ea|&s;on at Covent-Garden theatre; and do actually think, I can do a great deal on your &s;tage with you <HI>alone,</HI> without interfering with any other actor's manner whatever.</P>

And as to mimicry, what is it? Why, a proceeding which he never could countenance; that he even de&s;pi&s;ed Garrick and Foote, for hav|ing introduced &s;o mean an art; and he then very politely de&s;ired me to walk down &s;tairs. This was truly on the &s;econd, not the fir&s;t floor, it be|ing more convenient for his communication with the theatre, from that part of his dwelling hou&s;e. I was obliged to march, and really felt petrified with my bright thought, which had turned out &s;o contrary from what I had ignorant|ly expected. Mr. Sheridan held the candle for me only till I got to the fir&s;t landing, and then ha&s;tily removed it, grumbling and &s;queaking to him&s;elf, and leaving me to feel my way in the dark, down a pair and a half of &s;teep &s;tairs&punc; and to gue&s;s my road in hopes of finding the &s;treet door.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan's voice was deep, and as oppo&s;itely &s;harp; and I &s;hould not have di&s;liked then to have put in practice what I propo&s;ed, had he given leave; for I was really perfect and ready. To a reader, this may appear in&s;ipid, but any per&s;on who can well recollect Mr. Sheridan's manner,
<PB N="189" REF="211">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ould be entertained to hear me in the proper vein relate it, as much depends on that; for there is a great deal in being in &s;pirits.</P>
<P>After that fracas he neither permitted me to play; or &s;poke to me during my &s;tay in Ireland, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ny own night excepted). I fixed on Jane Shore and Tom Thumb, for my play and farce, on the night allotted me, Saturday, February 25, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">58.</P>
<P>Mr. Chaigneau him&s;elf waited on Mrs. Fitz|henry to reque&s;t her powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance in Alicia, to which reque&s;t &s;he kindly a&s;&s;ented.

<P>At the bottom of the bill, tickets were to be had of Mr. Wilkin&s;on, at <HI>his hou&s;e</HI> in Big Strand Street; for be it known, that in three or four weeks after my recovering from my illne&s;s, when in Abbey-Street, my good cheer, round of friends, and company, occa&s;ioned me to keep very late <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">uts The <HI>then</HI> Bi&s;hop of Lantaff lodged dur|ing the winter, on the floor under mine; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> I made on coming home, and the added rumbling when got into my own apartment, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">d acting, &s;inging, &amp;c. made the Bi&s;hop's lodging very uncomfortable to him. He &s;ent for

The landlord, per force, waited on his next door neighbours (Mr. and Mrs. Chaigneau) and informed them in full of this unfortunate alledgement of his Grace, and humbly hoped they would not be offended at his not continuing Mr. Wilkin&s;on as a lodger, as he could not permit it without &s;u&s;taining the lo&s;s of his good and generous Bi&s;hop. Mr. and Mrs. Chaigneau laughed very heartily at the complaint, agreed in opinion with the landlord, allowed that he and the Bi&s;hop were both right, the latter hav|ing ju&s;t cau&s;e for his &s;tated objections.

We dined at five; ob&s;erve reader, that the cu&s;tom of dining in Dublin was and <HI>is</HI> much later than in London; very few, if any per&s;on or per&s;ons in e&s;tabli&s;hed trade there, ever dine till three o'clock, but in general at four. I kept my appointment at Mr. Hamilton's, and a happy day and evening I had; I got home about three o'clock in the morning; proud and &s;a|tisfied was I when conveyed in a chair to my new man&s;ion, where all &s;eemed to be conducted with the utmo&s;t care, and made comfortable for my reception.</P>
<P>A merry day, and plenty of good things, had prepared me for &s;leep. The dining-room was &s;pacious, the bed-chamber large, the bed excel|lent, and I laid my&s;elf down, expecting a delicious repo&s;e, to repair the fatigues of luxury: To relate what follows may &s;eem &s;uperfluous.

it is po&s;&s;ible you may laugh at me, and I beg you will make &s;ome little allowance for what you do not feel; but if you do &s;matter of the like &s;en&s;a|tion, I am certain of your bounty. I can be a&s;toni&s;hed how any man, woman, or child, can faint at &s;eeing a cat, becau&s;e a cat I am partial to, and like as a companion; another will faint at the &s;mell of chee&s;e; a lady will &s;hudder at a leg of mutton not being cut to plea&s;e her; and a thou&s;and in&s;tances might be given of the weakne&s;s of human nature in &s;uch trifling matters: Yet they are in truth terrible to the per&s;ons who labour under the like unhappy prejudices, and too often laughed at by the ob&s;ervers, which is cruelty in the extreme: for how can I reconcile to my&s;elf, in con&s;cience, the being plea&s;ed with the terrors of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> ther on &s;eeing a cat, where I feel no unea&s;ine&s;s, but, on the contrary, plea&s;ure?

prove, and explain: For a &s;word or pi&s;tol at my brea&s;t I do not think would prove &s;o great an alarm to me, as a rat would in my pocket or bed&punc; my di&s;tre&s;s on &s;uch an accidental misfortune would be attended, not only with agonizing &s;en&s;ations&punc; but, I verily believe, immediate danger.</P>
<P>To prove that fear is the re&s;ult of nature, I will ob&s;erve, that by my living on the banks o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Thames in London for many years, rats were as familiar as kittens to my &s;ight; nay, more &s;o, for where I &s;aw one cat I mu&s;t have &s;een twenty rats, at low water, about the logs of wood, lighters, &amp;c. On a fine day they &s;warmed, and towards evening it was their grand rendezvous. My mother had the &s;ame prejudice. I have heard her mention repeatedly, that when &s;he was near her time with me, one day, when dre&s;&s;ed to dine out with company, being near the top of the &s;tairs, a rat pa&s;&s;ed &s;uddenly between her legs, which alarm cau&s;ed her immediately to fall from the top to the bottom; and, in&s;tead of vi&s;iting, was put to bed extremely ill, and judged to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in imminent danger: Whether that might b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> the original cau&s;e to ground the&s;e fears in me, I cannot decide; but am certain I am &s;o.</P>

<PB N="195" REF="217">
but that hour &s;eemed to me the longe&s;t and mo&s;t painful I had ever experienced, (the fever and bli&s;ters on my ancles not forgot); indeed we generally feel our pre&s;ent woes as the wor&s;t. I was waked by a lump falling on my brea&s;t: My fir&s;t conjecture was, that a thief was in the room, and had placed his hand there. I then thought, by no more moving, it might be a cat; which re|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ection was of great comfort and con&s;olation; and next, like Richard the Third, concluded it was but a dream, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed heroi&s;m &s;ufficient to &s;tart my&s;elf up in the bed, and, like our &s;tage Harry the Eighth, to cry out <HI>Hough! hough!</HI>&mdash;which act of va|lour was no &s;ooner performed than I was immedi|ately &s;aluted with the &s;queaking of vermin, and their running up and down the curtains, and over the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">d, and under the bed.

they would &s;oon have conquered me, their petrified foe. What re&s;i&s;tance immediate danger might have enabled me to perform I know not; but as I feel at this moment on the relation, I am certain the bribe mu&s;t be enormous that could prevail on me to touch a living rat.</P>
<P>When day-light had befriended me, and the gentry had retired to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ecret apartments, I found the bell, and couragiou&s;ly rung and called for the &s;ervants.

<P>Mr. Dexter was the gentleman who appeared at Drury-Lane in 1752 in Oroonoko with more than common expectation of great &s;ucce&s;s, and was in 1758 noted as a leading actor in the he|roes and fine gentlemen on Smock-Alley &s;tage. I mu&s;t &s;ay in ju&s;tice to my&s;elf, that I was perfect to the line, if not to the letter, con&s;equently the play went &s;moothly on, and I obtained applau&s;e of cour&s;e from &s;o numerous a &s;et of friends. Mrs. Fitzhenry, in Alicia, gave (as was u&s;ual) great &s;a|tisfaction, as I did to an extravagant degree when magnificently arrayed for Queen Dollalolla in Tom Thumb, which obtained a continued roar, as I played it as Woffington; and I certainly may be allowed to &s;ay, the &s;teadine&s;s and earne&s;tne&s;s of the imitation was at lea&s;t equal to any modern profe&s;&s;or's attempt.</P>

that day, week, or month, but never effaced to the pre&s;ent moment, now including above thirty-two years, I took leave of my good friends, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two valuable gifts, health and wealth.&mdash;Indeed to the wonderful care of the&s;e good and unde&s;cribable per&s;ons can I only attribute my exi&s;t|ence, and al&s;o my wealth, as from that time, till encumbered with the cares of my pre&s;ent unpro|mi&s;ing and perplexed &s;tate, I never knew, in the cour&s;e of &s;everal years, the want of ca&s;h; which &s;tate of happine&s;s my after frequent vi&s;its to Dub|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">n made me, as a young man, in a kind of inde|pendence.</P>

only with this difference, the cobbler might have been in health and happy, but I had been ill, very ill, and a poverty-&s;truck youth&mdash;I &s;ailed from Ireland with a fair wind, attended by the waft of numberle&s;s good wi&s;hes for my &s;afe arrival in Old England.</P>
<P>At Che&s;ter I met young Mr. Bagnal, (a gentle|man of family in Ireland) and as I was become a man of fortune, we travelled po&s;t, like gentlemen, and arrived &s;afe in the metropolis. I felt my<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">elf in &s;tep, air, and mind, a very different per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on from what I was when I left London.</P>
<P>Soon after my arrival I took leave of Mr. Bag|nal, and pre&s;ented my&s;elf with as much duty as plea&s;ure to my dear mother, as every &s;on &s;hould and ought to do, and am certain the return was overpaid by her.

<HI>friend.</HI> And what might be termed coldly that of duty, did not create the ground-work only of my e&s;teem, for all I did &s;prung &s;olely from &s;elf-love, as making her happy was my inclination, plea&s;ure, and delight; nor do I mean by the&s;e prote&s;tations to convey merit in any extraordinary degree to my&s;elf, for had &s;he not been a &s;en&s;ible and an en|dearing mother, I doubt whether my good beha|viour had been con&s;picuous beyond mediocrity. The giving to her an account of my riches, and my friends in Ireland was a fea&s;t; and my pro|ducing the 130l. bill was a dazzling &s;ight indeed, though only in black and white letters.</P>
<P>Soon after my arrival I paid a vi&s;it to Mr. Gar|rick, who wi&s;hed me joy, though not in a joy|ful manner. I gave him an account of my bene|fit, &amp;c. and thanked him for his leave of ab&s;ence. The &s;econd Saturday after my being in London, as I had &s;taid in Ireland by permi&s;&s;ion only, I went to the trea&s;urer's office for my weekly &s;ti|pend of thirty &s;hillings, as &s;tipulated in my article, but which at that time would only have been twenty &s;hillings, as the &s;ea&s;on of Lent was not expired.</P>
<P>On my a&s;king for my &s;alary, Mr. Pritchard, fir&s;t trea&s;urer, and Mr. Wood, &s;ub-trea&s;urer, in|formed me, that as they had not received any or|ders from Mr. Garrick or Mr. Lacey, they dared
<PB N="204" REF="226">
not pay me, and I could not, as they apprehended, have any right to it, but would inquire what they were to do when they &s;aw either of the ma|nagers. I argued my right of payment was un|doubtable by my article, but of cour&s;e was obliged to depart as I came, neither richer nor poorer.</P>
<P>A few days after I met Mr. Garrick in Bridge|&s;treet, who, on &s;eeing me, in&s;tantly, with upbraid|ing and &s;evere terms, acco&s;ted me for my being &s;o audacious (as he termed it) to call at his office for money. He added, (in a &s;upercilious manner) that I had met with a little accidental &s;uc|ce&s;s in Ireland, a circum&s;tance that never could happen again; and he had from motives of <HI>cha|rity</HI> obtained me a retreat to &s;ecure me from want of bread, and I repaid his kindne&s;s with impudent a&s;&s;urance and ingratitude. This &s;udden attack really alarmed me, as I had &s;till formed great hopes for my future &s;ucce&s;s on Mr. Garrick's power and friend&s;hip from what he had &s;o often profe&s;&s;ed, though not yet put into practice. In my defence I urged, (with the aid of truth) that I had only been ab&s;ent upon furlow, and by his permi&s;&s;ion had only continued on the &s;ame granted authority, not having pre&s;umed to &s;tay in Dublin, though a &s;evere and dangerous illne&s;s had intervened; but under the &s;anction of that grant, and having an article for that and the fol|lowing

year, I e&s;teemed my&s;elf much obliged to him. But <HI>inwardly</HI> pre&s;uming on my right of ar|ticle, I could not in word, manner, or obedience, in duty to my&s;elf, give up a point I had &s;o far en|gaged in with that great monarch, but per&s;i&s;ted, that on my return to London, and his theatre, I was every way entitled to my &s;alary.</P>
<P>He au&s;terely an&s;wered, had I returned (as he ex|expected I &s;hould) in great di&s;tre&s;s, his own good|ne&s;s and feelings would have allowed me the &s;a|lary; but as I a&s;&s;erted a fal&s;ehood, and was not in want, my in&s;olence de&s;erved puni&s;hment, for there was not any &s;uch agreement &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us. I, all &s;ecurity, and full of open conviction again&s;t him, in the face of day not only a&s;&s;er|ted my right, but ha&s;tily produced my bond, which was worded thus on the back, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Articles of agreement between David Garrick and James Lacey, E&s;quires, and Tate Wilkin&s;on, Gentleman, for two years, from October 24, 1757."</Q> Here I concluded my&s;elf quite &s;ure, and of cour&s;e felt as elate as any plaintiff on the gaining a verdict in his favour.

This &s;hews how careful people &s;hould be to read every thing before they &s;ign; and never to tru&s;t the &s;eeming genero&s;ity and good nature of others. The contents of the in&s;ide of this great and mighty article did not take place till the September fol|lowing, 1758. How he could think it worth his notice to treat &s;o in&s;ignificant an object, as he termed me &s;ome months before, in &s;o mean, &s;o art|ful, and &s;o ungentlemanlike a manner, I from that time to this could never devi&s;e, unle&s;s through fear of my talents as an imitator, he held me in a contemptuous light; yet &s;till, ever watchful and careful in regard to him&s;elf, he might perhaps think me worth retaining for a trifling &s;alary, as an exotic for his hot-hou&s;e (for he always u&s;ed to term me his exotic); therefore he cho&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ock me up like a wild bea&s;t, to prevent my di&s;tract|ing his repo&s;e or his con&s;equence. Thus with|out &s;alary was I obliged to remain, and have re|cour&s;e to my philo&s;ophy, and &s;it down contented; but being a man of fortune as I <HI>then</HI> thought my|&s;elf, I went on a vi&s;it to a new &s;pot, the fa&s;hionable city of Bath, to drink the waters, having had an

invitation from my friend Mr. Hull. My intima|cy with that gentleman and Mi&s;s Morri&s;on, now Mrs. Hull, was fixed from our fir&s;t acquaintance the &s;ummer before at Maid&s;tone; from that time to the pre&s;ent, I have ever been favoured with their &s;tudy to oblige and &s;erve me, which I have never yet had it in my power to return according to my wi&s;hes. This acknowledgment I offer as a debt of honour; and though not &s;ub&s;tantial, my gratitude and good opinion could not let &s;lip this opportu|nity of paying a tributary compliment, to the me|rit of tho&s;e particular and worthy friends.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t appearance at Bath, was on Monday the 8th of May, 1758, for Mi&s;s Morri&s;on's bene|fit. Othello, Mr. Wilkin&s;on, from the theatre|royal, Dublin; al&s;o, Mr. Wilkin&s;on will treat Mr. <HI>Foote</HI> with a Di&s;h of his own Tea. I was kindly received, Mr. Quin was at the play; the imita|tions were well received; but from my not being known on the &s;tage, and not having had the &s;anc|tion of a London audience, the applau&s;e was very different from what I had been honoured with in Dublin, and what I afterwards gained <HI>at Bath,</HI> when I had become more u&s;ed to the &s;tage by a variety of playing, and the prai&s;es and applau&s;e of London had wreathed my brow with that all powerful phra&s;e termed <HI>the fa&s;hion:</HI> &s;o prevalent

<P>I gave Tea for Mr. Hull, on Wedne&s;day the 10th of May; and acted E&s;&s;ex (for the fir&s;t time), with Cadwallader in the farce of the Author, for Mi&s;s Ibbott. In the interim, the families of the Town&s;ends and the Hanways in London, were all well-wi&s;hers for my mother's and my welfare, and were ever devi&s;ing ways and means to advance and e&s;tabli&s;h my future &s;ucce&s;s; their tables, when I was in London, were my con&s;tant welcome places of re&s;ort. While I was figuring away at Bath for my own diver&s;ion from May, without any engage|ment, till September following at Drury-Lane, they were deliberating for my real pro&s;perity much more than I could my&s;elf. The Town&s;ends had at that very juncture Major Strode and his lady, from Port&s;mouth, at their hou&s;e on a vi&s;it: Major Strode was the fir&s;t in command at the Port&s;|mouth garri&s;on; at the &s;ame time there were a Mrs. Arnold and Mi&s;s Arnolds her daughters, from Port&s;mouth, al&s;o on a vi&s;it in London; they were di&s;tant relations to the Hanways. My mother who was a frequent and a welcome vi&s;itor, and in|deed a de&s;irable gue&s;t, being at dinner at the

Town&s;ends on a grand gala day, and where the above ladies and gentlemen were pre&s;ent, the good old lady Mrs. Town&s;end, with her genuine marks of benevolence and kindne&s;s, de&s;ired a gla&s;s round to the health of her young friend and pupil for prayers, Tate Wilkin&s;on, which was of cour&s;e immediately a&s;&s;ented to, and complied with ac|cording to her wi&s;h. This gave my truly good mother an opportunity to inform the worthy cir|cle, that after all the afflictions and misfortunes that had unremittingly pur&s;ued her through life, &s;he was, &s;he thanked the great Being, ble&s;&s;ed with a &s;on who made it his &s;tudy to &s;upport her and to be&s;tow every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power to render her latter days comfortable and ea&s;y. They all agreed that being &s;o good a &s;on as my mother had de&s;cribed, I de&s;erved every prai&s;e and every encouragement.&mdash;Mr. Jonas Hanway confirmed what my mother had related, and they all joined in wi&s;hes for my &s;ucce&s;s, and a continuance of re|gard and duty being paid to her allowed worth.

tempting and beautiful effect from Port&s;mouth ramparts. The Bath company were there at that time, with them I had nearly engaged my|&s;elf on the late trip to Bath, had not Mrs. Strode's lucky thought intervened, and put a &s;top to the bu&s;ine&s;s, and a fortunate preventative it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>The Bath comedians were induced to the I&s;le of Wight by the &s;elf &s;ame bait, that at one time or the other &s;educes all mankind, that is the love of lucre; and which great mini&s;ters, as well as great players ever have in view.

<P>Their theatrical Bath maje&s;ties therefore ordered

a baggage waggon, well loaded with armour, foils, truncheons, &s;pears, daggers, and all the implements of war were carefully packed up in ca&s;e of danger, to repel the French in their flat-bottomed boats, as well as to prove to the regiments, how ably the female warriors were prepared to face the ene|my. The waggon was intru&s;ted not only with all the theatrical wardrobe, but with all their own private geer, and that &s;eriou&s;ly &s;peaking was a property of real value, con&s;i&s;ting of linen, clothes, jewels, regalia, &amp;c. to repre&s;ent kings and queens of France and England, Spain, Portugal, &amp;c. al&s;o emperours and empre&s;&s;es, that never were or ever will be; all the&s;e trea&s;ures and nece&s;&s;aries were &s;afely &s;towed, not forgetting the bones ap|pertaining to Hamlet, Cali&s;ta, &amp;c.

not more &s;trange than true, Mr. Kea&s;berry, now manager of the Bath theatre, can te&s;tify the fact.

<P>Early in October I met Lord Robert Manners, who was cro&s;&s;ing James-&s;treet, Covent Garden, and whom I had forgot to mention as one of our party at Park-Gate and Holyhead on my journey the year before to Ireland.

When I &s;olicited Lord Harcourt, &s;ome few years ago, to intercede with his Maje&s;ty for a re|newal of my York and Hull patents, I was high|ly favoured by my fellow traveller, Lord Robert Manners, for the permi&s;&s;ion he gave me of his name to Lord Harcourt: He &s;aw me twice in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">itting-room below &s;tairs in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare; he declared he could chat, but he could not write; he was a picture of reverence and decay, for he had dignity to the la&s;t, but death &s;eemed entirely to have full and fa&s;t hold; he a&s;&s;ured me he &s;aw no vi&s;itors, therefore this permi&s;&s;ion was the more kind; he complained of excruciating agony, and in a very <HI>&s;hort time</HI> after, that worthy, friendly, brave &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ldier, and nobleman departed this life.</P>
<P>On Lord Robert Manners &s;topping to &s;peak to me in James-&s;treet, after one of our u&s;ual chats, he wi&s;hed my &s;ucce&s;s in London might equal that of Dublin, and we parted; but he had no &s;oon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">r left me than, as I was pur&s;uing my walk, a &s;trong voice i&s;&s;ued from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ining-room window with great vehemence, calling out&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Wilkin&s;on!

Dublin, never to trouble my&s;elf as to any future intimacy or acquaintance with him; but life's chapter of accidents is &s;o various, and hangs by &s;uch nice threads, that there is no directing, being directed, or advi&s;ed for the be&s;t. It would cer|tainly have appeared very rude not to have com|plied with &s;o &s;miling and earne&s;t a &s;ummons, and after ten minutes conver&s;ation all my &s;lights and wrongs were forgot and forgiven; and &s;ure if ever <HI>one</HI> per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the talents of plea&s;ing more than another, Mr. Foote was certainly the man. I can aver in all my ob&s;ervations that I never met with his equal.

Mr. Foote was not confined to any particular topic; he was equal in all; religion, law, politics, manners of this or any age, and the &s;tage of cour&s;e. Indeed a poli&s;hed &s;tranger would find it rare to meet with &s;o many agreeable qualities for the conviviality of any company &s;o combined as in a &s;ociety with Mr. Foote.

As a blemi&s;h to his entertaining and im|proving qualities I mu&s;t, as a relater of truth re|mark, that all the&s;e &s;hining talents did not dazzle or an&s;wer the eager expectation, unle&s;s he him|&s;elf was the &s;ole object of every directed eye; for if a man of genius (I will &s;uppo&s;e a Murphy or a Hender&s;on) had &s;lipt in a good &s;tory, or had given any entertaining information, and thereby gained the approbation and merit of the flowing &s;ouls, Foote not only immediately felt le&s;&s;ened, but could not ea&s;ily recover his chagrin and jealou&s;y; and the in&s;tant the gue&s;t had taken his leave and departed, he could not help expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with great contempt, and a&s;king the per&s;on or per&s;ons re|maining if they had ever heard &s;uch d&mdash;d non|&s;ence as that man had been uttering? and added expre&s;&s;ions of wonder why the hounds at table &s;hould be entertained with &s;uch ab&s;urdity.
