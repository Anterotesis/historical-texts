<P>The flattering Reception which this little Opera, &s;o trifling, and &s;o temporary, has met with from the Public, mu&s;t chiefly be attributed to the friendly Care and Attention of <HI>Mr. Coleman,</HI> and the exerted Abilities of all the Performers.</P>

<P>Why that's the rea&s;on they are &s;o de&s;irous to vi&s;it ours. But lo&s;e no time, my lads; I expect our chief lord down every in&s;tant, and as he is a great friend to harmony, I beg we may have no di&s;cord.</P>

No, papa, I have no &s;uch fears, I a&s;&s;ure you; but can you wonder at my being pen&s;ive, when one I hold &s;o dear is now encount'ring the dangers of the &s;ea, or the attacks of the enemy?</P>
