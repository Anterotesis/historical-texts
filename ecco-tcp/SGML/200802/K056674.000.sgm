<HEAD>A VIEW Of the real Dangers of the SUCCESSION, FROM The Peace with <HI>France,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion is a Thing of that Con&s;equence to this Nation, and upon which the Peace and Pro|&s;perity of the People does &s;o entirely depend, as from its Nature and Con&s;equences very much ju&s;ti|fies the Anxieties of our Minds about it; this is the rea&s;on of mo&s;t of that Unea&s;ine&s;s in the &s;everal publick Tran&s;actions, which many People expre&s;s, for fear le&s;t that Se|curity for this Succe&s;&s;ion, which we have &s;o much depended upon, &s;hould Suffer, be Le&s;|&s;en'd, Invaded, or any way made Precarious.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">The&s;e Fears have been very much en|crea&s;ed among us, and the common People render'd very Jealous, by the publick Re|ports &s;o frequent, and &s;o warmly &s;pread among us, of the Encrea&s;e of the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s <HI>Intere&s;t</HI>; the Concert between the <HI>Friends</HI> of the <HI>Pretender</HI> at Home, and their <HI>Confede|rates</HI> Abroad; particularly the terrible Ac|counts of the <HI>French</HI> Power, which are now repre&s;ented to us, not only as Formidable, but as al&s;o firmly Engaged to A&s;&s;i&s;t and Rein|&s;tate the Intere&s;t, and Title, and Per&s;on, of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e have been the Rea&s;ons why many People have been &s;o warm again&s;t the <HI>Treaty of Peace with France:</HI> And indeed, what|ever may have been objected by the Friends of the Mini&s;try again&s;t tho&s;e Fears, and Unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of the People about the <HI>Peace,</HI> this mu&s;t be own'd, that if all that has been &s;aid on the other Side be true, tho&s;e Fears and Unea&s;ine&s;&s;e&s;s may be very rational. No one can rea&s;onably blame People for di&s;like|ing the <HI>Peace,</HI> if that <HI>Peace</HI> is calculated for bringing in the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and by Con&s;e|quence for over-throwing our <HI>Prote&s;tant Settlement,</HI> on which our Religion, Proper|ties, Liberties, Trade, and General Peace do entirely depend.</P>
<P>As the Di&s;contents on one Hand have been fomented, or encrea&s;ed, upon tho&s;e Suppo&s;i|tions as above&s;aid, <HI>viz.</HI> that the <HI>Peace</HI> was ill
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Made; that there was no Security in <HI>it</HI> for the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI>; that the <HI>French</HI> King was Strengthen'd by <HI>it</HI> to &s;uch a De|gree, as to make him more Dangerous than ever; and, that he was not di&s;couraged by <HI>it</HI> from the <HI>Jacobite Intere&s;t</HI>; &s;o, on the other Hand, it was Confronted at fir&s;t by little or nothing of Argument founded upon Fact. But in general a&s;&s;uring the People, that it was not &s;o; that the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> was confirm'd; the Power of <HI>France</HI> reduced; the <HI>Pretender</HI> ba|ni&s;h'd; the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> recognized, and the like: But nothing appearing on either Side, the People remain'd fluctuating between va|rious Uncertainties. Influenc'd as to Hopes and Fears, as their Parties, their In&s;tructers, or rather Deceivers, on both Sides, prevail'd; and as the In&s;inuations they offer'd work'd upon their Pa&s;&s;ions. In this unfix'd Po&s;ture of Mens Minds, it is no wonder if the Gene|rallity of the People fall into the wor&s;t; for Fear of Evil is &s;o ea&s;ily capable to prevail above the Hope of Good, having natural Propen&s;ity always ready to fall into the Scale with it, that it is not to be wonder'd at, if the Rea&s;oning part was over-come, and we began Univer&s;ally to di&s;tru&s;t, that the <HI>Pretender</HI> was hid in the Secret of the <HI>Peace,</HI> and that the Treaty was but a <HI>French</HI> Ma&s;k to deceive the People.</P>
<P>While the Treaty remain'd an Embrio, Imperfect, and Unfini&s;h'd, it could not be
<PB N="6" REF="5">
expected that this Uncertainty on both Sides could be Ma&s;ter'd, or that Satisfactory Ar|guments could be given, either by one Par|ty or other, to confirm what they had al|ledged before, and gain the People one Way or other.</P>
<P>That <HI>Difficulty</HI> is now over; the <HI>Treaty</HI> is fini&s;hed; the <HI>Peace</HI> made; the <HI>Ratifications</HI> exchang'd; and the <HI>Articles</HI> made publick: It has been the receiv'd Opinion, that the End and De&s;ign of Publications in &s;uch Ca&s;es is allow'd to be in order to general Satisfac|tion; and we are thereby tacitly admitted to Rea&s;on upon, Debate, and Explain to one another the Sub&s;tance and Meaning of the Treaty, that we may know what it is we have obtain'd by the <HI>War</HI>; what Confirm'd, Gain'd, and E&s;tabli&s;hed by the <HI>Peace</HI>; and upon what Foundation of Security our <HI>Li|berties, Religion,</HI> and <HI>E&s;tates</HI> &s;tand for the time to come. To do this Calmly, and Im|partially, is the De&s;ign of this Work; and the End is the more ju&s;t, in that two Things of great Con&s;equence are propo&s;ed to be inclu|ded in the De&s;ign of doing it.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If any Difficulties &s;hould offer, as pri|vate By-&s;tanding Judgments may &s;ome|times give hints to publick Tran&s;actions, which even the Per&s;ons acting, how|ever Wi&s;e, might not fore&s;ee, it may not be too late to obtain &s;uch Provi&s;ion
<PB N="7" REF="6">
again&s;t them, or again&s;t the Con&s;equen|ces of them, as may make up the De|ficiencies, <HI>if any &s;uch were,</HI> in the fir&s;t Part of the Conduct; that &s;o the Evil may be anticipated, and the Di&s;&s;atis|factions which attend &s;uch Things prevented.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That if there are no Difficulties, but that all Things are provided for, &s;uffi|ciently e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and the <HI>Peace, Li|berty,</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> of the Nation &s;ecu|red by all the needful and due Pro|vi&s;ion which was po&s;&s;ible, being made for the Safety and Certainty of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> People may be made duly Sen&s;ible of it; their Doubts, Fears, Jealou&s;ies, and Apprehen&s;ions be removed, and the real Securities of their State placed in &s;uch a true Light, that they may no more be capable of being made unea&s;y by Mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions, and Sugge&s;tions of Per&s;ons wick|edly di&s;po&s;ed.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>There are divers other good Ends and Pur|po&s;es contain'd in a De&s;ign &s;o u&s;eful as this, of Di&s;cu&s;ing the <HI>Articles of Peace</HI>; which, perhaps, may, in the following Work, be hinted at, particularly the Stating and Exa|mining into the real Power and Capacity of the <HI>French</HI> King to impo&s;e upon <HI>Europe,</HI> after this <HI>Peace</HI>; the Validity of the <HI>Renun|ciations</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> King, and the Proba|bility which there is, or is not before us, that the&s;e Treaties &s;hall be kept &s;acred by the <HI>French,</HI> as they are like to be by us. In brief, the great que&s;tion of the Validity of a Treaty as &s;uch with the <HI>French,</HI> may be Exa|mined as it re&s;pects not his Honour and Faith only, which &s;ome People, in Matters of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> have been very free with; but as it re&s;pects the Power and Influence the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Court may hereafter have in the World, to enforce the Treaty, and to do the Nation Ju&s;tice on the Agre&s;&s;ors in any Contraven|tions that may happen.</P>
<P>In doing this an entire Impartiallity is nece&s;&s;ary, neither on the one Hand adher|ing too warmly to tho&s;e Opinions, who give up the Securities of this Treaty as entirely Void, and In&s;ignificant, with re&s;pect to the Faith and Honour of the Parties we have Treated with; and run down as Ridiculous and Ab&s;urd, the Notion of <HI>Britain</HI>'s holding the Ballance, or being able to enforce the Performance in time to come: And on the other Hand, not altogether &s;uppo&s;ing that there is nothing of Danger, either in the Will or Abillity of the <HI>French</HI> Court to make unju&s;t Improvements, and Advantages, in breach of the Treaty hereafter.</P>
<P>In order to come directly to the Ca&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary to give the Reader an Ab&s;tract of what Provi&s;ions are really made in the <HI>Trea|ty</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8">
with <HI>France,</HI> for the Security of the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> in <HI>Great Britain</HI>; for that many who may, perhaps, &s;ee this Tract, may not have &s;een the Treaty it&s;elf, or may not have the Articles by them to refer to.</P>
<P>I'll take no Advantage here of what, how|ever, I do really believe, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Trea|ty is very &s;urprizing to &s;ome People; who, having been made to believe that there was no Care taken in it for the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;|&s;ion,</HI> did not expect to find two &s;uch Articles as the Fourth and Fifth to be incerted in it, and that they &s;hould be Worded in &s;uch a Manner. And therefore, before we proceed to Animadvert on that Opinion, or to Exa|mine, whether that Surprize is ju&s;t, or, whe|ther the Objections others make again&s;t the Security of tho&s;e Articles are &s;ufficient to continue the general Di&s;&s;atisfactions, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to place the Articles them&s;elves in View as follows:
<Q><P N="4">IV. Furthermore for adding a greater Strength to the Peace which is re&s;tored, and to the faithful Friend&s;hip which is never to be violated, and for cutting off all Occa&s;ions of di&s;tru&s;t, which might at any time ari&s;e from the e&s;tabli&s;hed Right and Order of the Hereditary Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the Limitation thereof by the Laws of <HI>Great Britain</HI> (made and enacted in the Reigns
<PB N="10" REF="9">
of the late King <HI>William</HI> the Third, of glorious Memory, and of the pre&s;ent Queen) to the I&s;&s;ue of the above&s;aid Queen, and in default thereof, to the mo&s;t Serene Prince&s;s <HI>Sophia,</HI> Dowager of <HI>Brun&s;wick-Hanover,</HI> and her Heirs in the Prote&s;tant Line of <HI>Hanover.</HI> That therefore the &s;aid Succe&s;&s;ion may remain &s;afe and &s;ecure, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King &s;incerely and &s;olemnly acknowledges the above&s;aid Limitation of the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and on the Faith and Word of a King, on the Pledge of His own and His Succe&s;&s;ors Honour, He does declare and engage, That He accepts and approves the &s;ame, and that His Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors do and &s;hall accept and approve the &s;ame for ever. And under the &s;ame Obliga|tion of the Word and Honour of a King, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King promi&s;es, That NO ONE be&s;ides the Queen Her Self, and Her Succe&s;&s;ors, according to the Series of the &s;aid Limitation, &s;hall ever by Him, or by His Heirs or Succe&s;&s;ors, be acknow|ledged, or reputed to be King or Queen of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> And for adding more ample Credit to the &s;aid Acknowledgment and Promi&s;es, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King does engage, That whereas the Per&s;on who, in the Life-time of the late King <HI>James</HI> the Second, did take upon him
<PB N="11" REF="10">
the Title of Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and &s;ince his Decea&s;e, that of King of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> is lately gone, of his own accord, out of the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> to re&s;ide in &s;ome other place, He the afore&s;aid mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, His Heirs and Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, will take all po&s;&s;ible Care, that he &s;hall not at any time hereafter, or un|der any pretence what&s;oever, return into the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> or any the Do|minions thereof.</P>
<P N="5">V. Moreover the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King pro|mi&s;es, as well in His own name, as in that of His Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, That they will at no time whatever Di&s;turb, or give any Mole&s;tation to the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> Her Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, de&s;cended from the afore&s;aid Prote&s;tant Line, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the Dominions belonging thereunto. Neither will the afore&s;aid mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, or any one of His Heirs, give at any time any Aid, Succour, Favour, or Council, directly or indirect|ly, by Land, or by Sea, in Money, Arms, Ammunition, Warlike Provi&s;ion, Ships, Soldiers, Seamen, or any other way, to any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons, who&s;oever they be, who for any Cau&s;e, or under any Pre|text what&s;oever, &s;hould hereafter, en|deavour

to oppo&s;e the &s;aid Succe&s;&s;ion, either by open War, or by fomenting Se|ditions, and forming Con&s;piracies again&s;t &s;uch Prince or Princes who are in Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Throne of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> by Virtue of the Acts of Parliament a|forementioned, or again&s;t that Prince or Prince&s;s, to whom the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain</HI> &s;hall be open ac|cording to the &s;aid Acts of Parliament.</P></Q></P>
<P>Immediately after the&s;e Two Articles fol|lows the formal Renunciations of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> which, as they are not within the Compa&s;s of our pre&s;ent Con&s;iderations, &s;o it will be needle&s;s to repeat them here; nei|ther will the narrow Compa&s;s of this Tract admit of it. But it may not, neverthele&s;s, be ami&s;s to &s;et down a few Words of the In|troduction to tho&s;e Renunciations, as they &s;eem to lay down the Foundation upon which the whole Treaty &s;tands, and upon which much of the pre&s;ent Peace, and Secu|rity of <HI>Europe</HI> depends. The Words are the&s;e:
<Q>VI. Whereas the mo&s;t de&s;tructive Flame of War, which is to be extingui&s;hed by this Peace, aro&s;e chiefly from thence, That the Security and Liberties of <HI>Europe</HI> could by no means bear the Union of the Kingdoms of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> under
<PB N="13" REF="14">
one and the &s;ame King; And whereas it has at length been brought to pa&s;s by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Divine Power, upon the mo&s;t earne&s;t In&s;tances of Her Sacred Royal Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and with the Con&s;ent both of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian, and of the Catholick King, that this Evil &s;hould in all times to come be obviated, by means of Renunciations drawn in the mo&s;t effectual Form, and executed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner.</Q></P>
<P>But to begin with the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> as the main thing upon which our Eyes are fix'd in this Treaty, and without which the whole is of very little Con&s;equence to us: And here it is nece&s;&s;ary to lay down a &s;hort View of the Rea&s;ons, and Foundation of the War, which, without doubt, are to be al&s;o &s;ome part of the Rea&s;on and Foundation of the <HI>Peace,</HI> or el&s;e the <HI>War</HI> will be no more to be ju&s;tify'd than the <HI>Peace,</HI> or the <HI>Peace</HI> to be thought adequate to the Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>War.</HI> The Rea&s;ons and Foundation of the <HI>War</HI> are abundantly expre&s;s'd in the &s;everal Declarations made as well by the Queen, and the late King <HI>William,</HI> as by the &s;everal Prin|ces and States, their Confederates; in which, if the Safety of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t</HI> is laid down, as the Thing mo&s;t at Heart among the Confederates, the &s;ame ought to be al&s;o the main De&s;ign, or at lea&s;t mo&s;t Regarded in the

making a <HI>Peace</HI>; for no <HI>Peace</HI> can be &s;up|po&s;ed to be effectual, but &s;uch as an&s;wers the Ends of the <HI>War</HI>; &s;uch as are &s;quared to the Purpo&s;es, which in the &s;aid Declarations of the <HI>War,</HI> are laid down to be the ju&s;t Rea&s;on for the Breach at the Beginning.</P>
<P>In the Declaration of <HI>War</HI> again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> Publi&s;hed in <HI>England</HI> by King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary, May</HI> the 7th, 1689, among divers other Rea&s;ons for the &s;ame, it is ex|pre&s;s'd in the&s;e Words: <HI>And,</HI> la&s;tly, <HI>as the &s;aid King of</HI> France <HI>has, for divers Years pa&s;t, endeavoured, by In&s;inuations, and Promi&s;es of A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to Over-throw the Government of</HI> England. And in the Preamble to the &s;aid Declaration it is thus expre&s;s'd: <HI>To the ut|mo&s;t to promote the Welfare of our People, by preventing the Mi&s;eries which threaten them from Abroad.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;econd Declaration of <HI>War</HI> again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> enter'd into by Her Pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, and publi&s;h'd <HI>May</HI> the 4th 1702. The Rea|&s;ons and Cau&s;es of the <HI>War</HI> are thus enume|rated.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Exorbitant Power of <HI>France,</HI> which mu&s;t be reduced.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Alliances which <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;tands engaged in, particularly the Grand Alliance, and that tho&s;e Allies ought to have rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="15" REF="16">3. And e&s;pecially the following Particu|lars, <HI>The</HI> French <HI>King has not only pro|ceeded to farther Violence, but has ad|ded thereunto a great Affront and In|dignity to us and our Kingdoms, in ta|king upon him to declare the pretended Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>King of</HI> England, Scot|land, <HI>and</HI> Ireland, <HI>and has al&s;o Influ|enced</HI> Spain <HI>to concur in the &s;ame Af|front and Indignity, as well as in other Oppre&s;&s;ions: Wherafore we find our &s;elves oblig'd for maintaining the publick Faith, for Vindication of the Honour of our Crown, and to prevent the Mi&s;chiefs which all</HI> Europe <HI>is threatned with, to declare War,</HI> &amp;c.

</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e being the propo&s;ed Rea&s;ons, and the ju&s;t Occa&s;ions of the pre&s;ent War, there &s;eems &s;everal Arguments to occur here, which I &s;hall mention previous to the en&s;uing Di&s;|cour&s;e.<LIST>
<ITEM>1.

<PB N="16" REF="17">
thereof, ought to be a Capital Con&s;ide|ration of the <HI>Peace</HI>; otherwi&s;e the End for which the <HI>War</HI> was begun was not &s;ufficiently an&s;wer'd; the Repo&s;e of <HI>Europe</HI> not atall obtain'd by the Trea|ty; the Queen's Honour &s;ufficiently repair'd, or the Affront given made amends for.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If the <HI>French</HI> King's bare Owning and Receiving the <HI>Pretender</HI> as King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> was made a &s;ufficient Foundation of the War; though he had then made no Effort for his E&s;tabli&s;h|ment, or had any way attempted to place him on the Throne; then the &s;aid <HI>French</HI> King retracting the &s;aid Owning and Recieving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and pro|mi&s;ing, as by the Treaty of Peace, Ar|ticle the 4th he does, on the Faith and Word of a King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Never to Receive him again, or any way to Aid or A&s;&s;i&s;t him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in Di&s;turbing Her Maje&s;ty, or Her Succe&s;&s;ors in the Line of <HI>Han|over,</HI> is as much Security as could be a&s;k'd of the <HI>French</HI> King, and may be taken in full Satisfaction of that Parti|cular, till <HI>France</HI> makes &s;ome vi&s;ible Infraction of that Engagement.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>For the fir&s;t of the&s;e that the King of <HI>France</HI> Revoking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Acknowledgment
<PB N="17" REF="18">
he had made of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and Recog|nizing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Queen and the Succe&s;&s;ion ought to be a Capital Con&s;ideration of the Peace; there &s;eems to be no occa&s;ion to enter into any Debate about it; e&s;pecially &s;ince the King of <HI>France</HI> has yielded to the Ju&s;tice of it in Expre&s;&s;ions &s;o full, and to the utmo&s;t Extent of all that could be de&s;i|red, as appears by the Fourth Article: But it is chiefly mention'd here as matter of Wonder, that any among us &s;hould object again&s;t the Mea&s;ures taken at the Beginning, and indeed thro' the Progre&s;s of this Treaty, as if the mo&s;t &s;olemn Recognitions of Her Maje&s;ty's Title to the Crown, and of the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Succe&s;&s;ion in the Prote&s;tant Line of <HI>Hanover</HI> could be forgotten.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t the Objection, as it was former|ly made again&s;t the Six Propo&s;als of <HI>France,</HI> called (however mi&s;takenly) <HI>Preliminaries, viz. That the</HI> French <HI>King did not &s;ufficient|ly Acknowledge the Queen's Rightful and Lawful Title to the Crown.</HI> This I think ought to be an&s;wer'd in the &s;ame manner that the <HI>Germans</HI> at this time reply to the Propo&s;als of Peace made by <HI>France</HI> to the Emperor; where the <HI>French</HI> King offers it as an Article, that he will acknowledge the Emperor as &s;uch: I &s;ay, it ought to be an|&s;wer'd in the &s;ame Manner, <HI>viz.</HI> with Con|tempt
<PB N="18" REF="19">
&s;ignifying, That the Imperial Crown having not the lea&s;t dependence upon the Vote Suffrage, or Acknowledgment of the King of <HI>France,</HI> they can by no means make his Acknowledging, or not Acknowledging the Election of the Per&s;on of his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty to that Crown to be an Article of a Treaty; or accept of &s;uch his Acknowledg|ment as any Condition of Peace. But that his bare Treating of Peace with his Imperial Maje&s;ty, as it is nece&s;&s;arily attended with &s;uch Acknowledgment, &s;o his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty cannot be Treated with, under any o|ther Title, Figure, or Denomination: For Example; that it would be ab&s;ur'd to treat with an Arch-Duke of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> in the Affairs and Properties of the Imperial Crown, or with the Empire, in the Matter of the Rights and Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, in the Ca&s;e of Her Maje&s;ty's Right|ful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Regal Titles, and Sove|reign Authority of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> there was no need to Capitulate with the <HI>French</HI> King to acknowledge Her Maje&s;ty in the u&s;ual Forms; for that the Crowns of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Succe&s;&s;ion of Her Maje&s;ty, having no manner of Dependence upon the <HI>French</HI> King, or the <HI>French</HI> Go|vernment, or upon any Vote Suffrage, or Recognition, on the part of <HI>France</HI> to be
<PB N="19" REF="20">
made. It would derogate from the Honour of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nation, from the Per&s;onal Right of Her Maje&s;ty, and the Authority of Parliament, to accept of any &s;uch Recog|nition of the Queen's Title from the King of <HI>France,</HI> as any Condition, Article, or Pre|liminary to an Article, in any Treaty what|&s;oever. But that, in the very Act of Treat|ing, &s;uch Recognition is &s;o effectually &s;up|ply'd and contain'd, that nothing can be more compleat; &s;ince the <HI>French</HI> King can|not commence any Treaty, but in the Name of Her Maje&s;ty, and with Her Maje&s;ty in Per&s;on, as repre&s;ented by Her Plenipotentia|ries, Clothed with all the Royal Stile and Dignity, Titles, and Appellations which at|tend the Per&s;ons of the Kings and Queens of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; which Names, Stile, Titles, Appellations, and Dignities are of meer Cour&s;e, and by the U&s;age and Cu&s;tom of all Treaties, always expre&s;s'd in the very fir&s;t Powers produced by the Mini&s;ters and Amba&s;&s;adors of each Prince, or Sovereign, &s;o Treating; and accepted by the other; and after that, are again nece&s;&s;arily repeated in the very Title and Introduction to &s;uch Treaty, or Agreement, which &s;hall after|ward be made, and as is for Example in the &s;everal Treaties as well of Peace as of Com|merce, now under Con&s;ideration; in the&s;e Words in Latin and in Engli&s;h. <Q><PB N="20" REF="21">Tractatus Pacis &amp; Amicitiae inter Sereni&s;&s;i|mam ac Potenti&s;&s;imam, Principem <HI>Annam,</HI> Dei Grati&acirc;, <HI>magnae Britanniae, Franciae,</HI> &amp; <HI>Hiberniae,</HI> Reginam.</Q>
In Ingli&s;h thus:<Q>A Treaty of Peace and Friend&s;hip between the mo&s;t Serene and mo&s;t Potent Prince&s;s <HI>Anne,</HI> by the Grace of God, Queen of <HI>Great Britain, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mark, the King of <HI>France</HI> here owns Her Maje&s;ty to be Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> &amp;c. and that She is &s;o by the GRACE OF GOD; not atall &s;uppo&s;ing Her Title de|pended upon his Recognition, or received any confirmation thereby.</P>
<P>Having then acknowledged Her Maje&s;ty to be Rightful and Lawful Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King could make no Scruple of coming into the re&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> to ac|knowledge the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> which is a Con&s;equence of the Revolution; upon which, as the Occa&s;ion, Her pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty's Right of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is built, and which is &s;ettled upon the Ba&s;is of Par|liamentary Limitation; which Parliamenta|ry Authority is the Rightful and Lawful

Power, among others, from which Her Maje&s;ty's Right of Claim immediately pro|ceeds.</P>
<P>Having al&s;o acknowledg'd the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, recognized the Authority that E&s;tabli&s;h'd it, and own'd the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Race of <HI>Hanover</HI> to be the only Rightful and Lawful Heir to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown, the re&s;t fell in as natural Con&s;equences, <HI>viz. Fir&s;t,</HI> That he &s;hould Expunge, Di&s;own, and Bani&s;h from his Dominions, the Per&s;on of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> engaging never to admit him to come again into his Kingdoms. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That he &s;hould, in the &s;olemne&s;t Manner po&s;&s;ible, engage never to Aid or A&s;&s;i&s;t him, or any one for him, directly, or indirectly, in making any Claim to the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or in offering any Di&s;turbance, either to Her Maje&s;ty's Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, or to the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion, as it is E&s;tabli&s;hed by the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>Let us then enquire how this is done, and in what manner expre&s;&s;ed, that the great Que&s;tion may afterwards come to be clearly Di&s;cu&s;s'd, <HI>viz. What Security this is to the</HI> Prote&s;tant <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion?</HI></P>
<P>The Words of the Article are as &s;trongly expre&s;s'd, and as full as can be devi&s;ed: And
<PB N="22" REF="23">
I hear many People expre&s;s them&s;elves with an agreeable Surprize that it is &s;o; for tho' all that is alledg'd of the Perfidy and Di&s;|ingenuous Principles of the <HI>French</HI> King, were to be acknowledg'd; yet, &s;ince Verbal A&s;&s;urances are &s;ometimes to be taken; and, perhaps, no other can be obtain'd in &s;ome things, of which this is one; it is as &s;a|tisfactory as the Nature of the Thing will allow, that tho&s;e Verbal A&s;&s;urances be full and compleat.</P>
<P>The Nature of Treaties is now &s;uch, and the Conduct of Princes Abroad is allow'd &s;uch a Latitude, that, in &s;ome re&s;pect, it may be &s;aid of all Treaties, nothing is to be Depended on but what either you have Power to Enforce, or the other gives &s;uffici|ent Security to Perform.</P>
<P>Thus, where Security could be obtain'd in this Affair of the Treaty, Her Maje&s;ty made a demand of &s;uch Security that &s;he might be in a Condition to Enforce the Ex|ecution: As for Example, The <HI>French</HI> King Offers, on a Peace, to Demoli&s;h <HI>Dunkirk. How &s;hall I be &s;ure of that?</HI> &s;ays Her Maje|&s;ty. <HI>Will you put it into my Hands immedi|ately, that I may have Power to &s;ee that Promi&s;e put in Execution?</HI> The <HI>French</HI> King Con&s;ents, &s;o that now the Queen of <HI>Great</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="24">
<HI>Britain</HI> demoli&s;hes <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> not the <HI>French</HI> King; that is, She holds it in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till it is done, and Her Forces are to Encamp in the Neighbourhood to &s;ee the Execu|tion.</P>
<P>It is but too well known a Truth, that there are &s;ome People, be&s;ides the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who are &s;urpriz'd, and ill-plea&s;ed to &s;ee this Affair &s;o remarkably &s;ettled by the Treaty, and that the <HI>French</HI> King has thereby &s;toop'd to &s;uch Declarations and Prote&s;tations again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender:</HI> And the&s;e are tho&s;e who, for other Ends, had much rather have been furni&s;h'd from the Articles them|&s;elves with &s;ufficient Grounds of Complaint, that the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion had been neg|lected; and the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender</HI> had not been &s;ufficiently Weakned, and Di&s;|courag'd. Such a Complaint being in its Nature very E&s;&s;ential to the Publick Good, and to the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Things in this Nation, would have been very Popular, and would have been capable of many ways of Improvement, to the Advantage of tho&s;e who &s;tudy to keep the People unea&s;ie, and di&s;temper'd, about the Publick Manage|ment of Affairs, and to whom nothing has contributed &s;o much, as the Notion of the Danger of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">The Complaints of the&s;e People have been &s;o loud, that no one could have thought but that they really knew what <HI>France</HI> was act|ing in this Affair; and that, even in the Articles them&s;elves, there had appear'd more Foundation for their Di&s;&s;atisfactions; it was no more que&s;tion'd by tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;ed all tho&s;e Complaints were well Grounded; I &s;ay, it was no more que&s;tion'd, but that when the Articles came to be made Publick, it would appear, that the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Han|over</HI> was very &s;lightly taken Notice of, and that room was left for the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender</HI> to be carry'd on; &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> King might at any time, after the Queen was Decea&s;ed, concern him&s;elf in that Mat|ter, without any dammage to his Honour and Faith; and any Branch of his Treaty with the Queen to the contrary, in any|wi&s;e notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>But I do not find, upon a &s;erious Revi&s;ing the Articles, but that the&s;e People, the fir&s;t movers of tho&s;e Complaints only excepted, are under very great Di&s;appointments upon the Articles fir&s;t appearing in Publick; nay, the mo&s;t Angry have not yet been able to find the lea&s;t Fault in the Recognitions and Provi&s;ions made, either on the Part of the <HI>French,</HI> or on Our Part, for the Security of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI>; or, to &s;ay what they
<PB N="25" REF="26">
could have demanded of the <HI>French</HI> King more than is Granted by the Treaty, with re&s;pect to that Particular. The Truth of the Ca&s;e being this, that the <HI>French</HI> King was not able to do more; or was it Hon|ourable for the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Plenipotentiaries to a&s;k more of him in that Particular.</P>
<P>It might be thought &s;ome Te&s;timonial to the Validity of the&s;e Articles, That the <HI>Ja|cobites</HI> in <HI>Great Britain</HI> are &s;o univer&s;ally Thunder-&s;truck with them, that there is &s;o profound a Silence thro' the whole Nation among them; nothing is heard from them of the u&s;ual Boa&s;ts they have, for &s;ome time, made of their Growing Intere&s;t, and of the great A&s;&s;i&s;tance their Prince &s;hould receive, upon any Occa&s;ion, for the E&s;tabli&s;hing him on the Throne of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Where|as now nothing is heard among them but very &s;ecret and private Reproaches, and Re|flections upon the <HI>French</HI> King, for &s;uffer|ing him&s;elf to yield to &s;uch &s;evere Condi|tions, and &s;o effectually to bind him&s;elf again&s;t the Intere&s;t of their Prince, as they call him, as never to A&s;&s;i&s;t him after the Queen's Death, and never to admit him to return into <HI>France</HI> again.</P>
<P>The&s;e Complaints, I &s;ay, are very &s;ecret|ly and &s;oftly expre&s;s'd among them too;
<PB N="26" REF="27">
for they cannot, without manife&s;t Ingrati|tude, complain of any one Step the <HI>French</HI> King has taken; they cannot deny, with|out the Reproaches of the whole World, but that the <HI>French</HI> King has gone a greater Length for the Propagation of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> than any Prince in the World could have done; and has done more for them than all the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Powers in the World would have done. The hazard of a Ruinous <HI>War,</HI> undertaken for the Re&s;toring King <HI>James</HI> II. and car|ry'd with no other View, thro' innumerable Di&s;a&s;ters to the <HI>Peace</HI> of <HI>Ry&s;wick</HI>; the Un|dertaking this &s;econd <HI>War</HI> under that di&s;ad|vantageous Step to <HI>France,</HI> of Acknowledg|ing the pre&s;ent <HI>Pretender</HI> as King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which ju&s;tly Enflam'd and Pro|vok'd this Nation to &s;uch a Degree, as to make all the Parts of the I&s;land Addre&s;s the late King <HI>William</HI> to renew the <HI>War,</HI> which otherwi&s;e the Nation, at that time, were not much inclin'd to. The&s;e things, at|tempted by the King of <HI>France,</HI> for the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Intere&s;t, leave the Friends of the <HI>Pretender</HI> no room to Exclaim again&s;t him, as otherwi&s;e they would have done, as a Man abandoning his Friend.</P>
<P>On the contrary, to reckon the divers Attempts, Hazards, Lo&s;&s;es, and Expence
<PB N="27" REF="28">
the <HI>French</HI> King has been at, in Behalf of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and of King <HI>James</HI> II. would be to Write the greate&s;t Panegyrick upon the Friend&s;hip, Con&s;tancy, and Genero&s;ity of the King of <HI>France</HI> that could po&s;&s;ibly be Written: In which the Armies &s;ent into <HI>Ireland</HI> to his Relief; the Lo&s;s of his Fleet at <HI>La Hogue</HI>; the Attempt upon <HI>Scotland</HI>; the con&s;tant Expence of Supporting the Court of St. <HI>Germans,</HI> and all its Hangers on, and Dependencies, for above Twenty Four Years, mu&s;t come to be reckon'd up; all which being con&s;ider'd, it is but in &s;ilent Murmurs that the <HI>Jacobites</HI> can complain of the <HI>French</HI> King, for giving up the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Pretender</HI> as he has done.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, his own Circum&s;tan|ces tell them plainly, that he has e&s;pou&s;ed their Cau&s;e as long as he was able to &s;upport him&s;elf; and that his Affairs were reduc'd to that Extremity, that he could no longer car|ry on the <HI>War</HI> with &s;afety; nor could he make any <HI>Peace</HI> without relinqui&s;hing, en|tirely, a Prince, and an Intere&s;t which he was not able to &s;upport.</P>
<P>The&s;e things &s;top their Mouths, I &s;ay as to Complaint, and therefore they te&s;tify their Surprize and De&s;pair, by a profound Silence; which Silence al&s;o tacitly acknow|ledges,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
that they look upon the Acknowledg|ments and Recognitions made by the <HI>French</HI> King, of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion to be too effectual a Blow to their Intere&s;t in <HI>Britain,</HI> which, on the other Hand, is an Argument to us to look upon it as &s;ome Security to the &s;aid Succe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>With the Silence of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> Party, and as a Con&s;equence thereof, the Fears and Apprehen&s;ions of Hone&s;t and Well-minded People abate al&s;o; I mean of &s;uch People who, being guided by no Party-Intere&s;t, kept their Eyes only upon the Publick Good, yet were made unea&s;ie, and alarm'd by the continued Sugge&s;tions of others, that the Mini&s;try, and even the Queen Her&s;elf, were in the Inte|re&s;t of the <HI>Pretender.</HI> It might take up &s;ome room here to Convince you that &s;uch Peo|ple were made Unea&s;ie, and by what Me|thod, on what Account, by Whom, and for what Rea&s;on. But I am willing to forget tho&s;e Things; the remembrance whereof &s;erve only to promote that which will help to Divide us, and to make us yet Unea&s;ie to one another.</P>
<P>That many good People were alarm'd with the Notion of the <HI>Pretender</HI> being at hand; and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a belief that the Mini&s;try and the <HI>French</HI> King were in Con|cert
<PB N="29" REF="30">
for the Re&s;toring him in the&s;e King|doms. This is what needs no Evidence; the very In&s;olence of the <HI>Jacobites</HI> as it was gi|ven for a Rea&s;on of their Apprehen&s;ions, &s;o it was a Confirmation of the Arguments others had u&s;ed for the rai&s;ing tho&s;e Jealou&s;ies and Apprehen&s;ions in the People.</P>
<P>They were told, that the Mini&s;try encou|rag'd and employ'd none but <HI>Jacobites</HI>; that the profe&s;s'd Friends of the <HI>Pretender</HI> had di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks of Favour &s;how'd them; that even the Dialect &s;poken at Court was different from what u&s;ed to be the Lan|guage in the Ca&s;e of the Succe&s;&s;ion; that Addre&s;&s;es were pre&s;ented, in which not on|ly the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> was not mention|ed, but in which the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender</HI> was expre&s;&s;lly recommended; and, that yet &s;uch Addre&s;&s;es were equally accepted, and received equally Graciou&s;ly with others; that the greate&s;t In&s;olences of &s;everal Per|&s;ons upon the Name of <HI>Hanover,</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> were left Unpuni&s;hed, and the like.</P>
<P>The Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Memorial was in the next Place mention'd, and the Re&s;entments expre&s;s'd by the Queen and Mini&s;try at the Publication thereof, with &s;e|veral other Things which were call'd to

mind, to confirm the Su&s;picions, and to per|&s;wade the People here, that the &s;ame Af|fection which promoted the Settlement of the Crown upon that Hou&s;e was not now to be found among us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>While the Treaty of Peace was in Agi|tation, the&s;e Su&s;pitions encrea&s;ed; and it was expected by &s;ome, that the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender</HI> was in immediate agitation; that the <HI>French</HI> Influence having a Governing Power among us, would not fail to attempt that by Treaty which they had &s;o often, and &s;o long attempted in the Field by the Sword.</P>
<P>It was a happy &s;urprize then to &s;uch Peo|ple as the&s;e, to find the afore&s;aid Articles Incerted in the Treaty of <HI>Peace,</HI> where the mo&s;t they could expect in favour of the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion was, that nothing expre&s;ly, on the other Side, &s;hould be incerted; and that the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould be prevail'd with to leave the <HI>Pretender</HI> to his own Fortunes, and to &s;ay nothing of him; nay, &s;ome Peo|ple would have thought this a great deal, and would even have compounded with us for &s;uch a Thing as a Favour to the Succe&s;|&s;ion of <HI>Hanover,</HI> which they had &s;carce rea|&s;on to expect.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">What then could &s;uch People &s;ay, when they found the utmo&s;t Care taken, and the &s;tronge&s;t Engagements enter'd into with the <HI>French</HI> King, for the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and the Recognizing, upon all Occa&s;ions, the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> as the Rightful and Law|ful Succe&s;&s;or to the Crown.</P>
<P>What could they &s;ay, but acknowledge them&s;elves Surpriz'd, Satisfy'd, and Pleas'd; as al&s;o, that they had been impos'd upon before: When they found the <HI>French</HI> King brought to Compliment the Queen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> with the &s;olemn and declar'd Ex|pul&s;ion of the Per&s;on of the <HI>Pretender</HI> from, not the Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Britain</HI> only, but even from the Dominions of <HI>France</HI>; and en|gaging to make that Expul&s;ion Perpetual, and that he &s;hall never be admitted to &s;et his Foot within the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> again.</P>
<P>Would any Man have thought that the King of <HI>France,</HI> who had formerly acted &s;o avowedly in the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and had voluntarily brought down upon his Kingdom &s;o heavy a War, by the meer de|claring him by the Titles of <HI>Britain</HI>; who had made &s;uch Efforts for him, and had Pro|mi&s;ed never to for&s;ake his Intere&s;t till he had e&s;tabli&s;hed him on the Throne, would
<PB N="32" REF="33">
be brought &s;o entirely to give him up, &s;o effectually to relinqui&s;h his Intere&s;t and Concerns, as to engage never to Own him again by tho&s;e Titles, which he him&s;elf had before acknowledged to him.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things having been &s;o openly de|clar'd again&s;t before, by the <HI>French</HI> King, it was the more Rational to expect, that the Party here might have been prevail'd upon, and Influenced by the <HI>French</HI> to have Coun|tenanced that Intere&s;t, or at lea&s;t to have contented them&s;elves with very moderate Provi&s;ions again&s;t him; and till the contrary appear'd, there was too much force in their Rea&s;oning the other way, not to take with the People who&s;e Minds were already pre|judiced as above&s;aid.</P>
<P>But when the Articles appear, the&s;e People &s;eem'd &s;urpriz'd; began to exclaim at the Inju&s;tice done the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, and to approve of what was done in behalf of the <HI>Hanover</HI> Succe&s;&s;ion; till they met with new Scruples and Sugge&s;tions, in order to keep up the Temper of Complaint, and to bring the Notions of the Danger of the <HI>Pretender</HI> into play again; and the&s;e were the ill Opinions which Common Fame had deeply Imprinted in the Minds of the People, of the <HI>French</HI> King being to the la&s;t Degree Perfidious;
<PB N="33" REF="34">
that he made no Scruple of breaking in up|on the mo&s;t &s;acred Engagement when ever his Ambition, Avarice, Super&s;tition, of e&s;pe|cially Thir&s;t of Glory, prompted; that he made no farther U&s;e of Treaties and Po&s;tu|lations, Articles and &s;olemn Conventions, than to amu&s;e and &s;eparate the Conjunction and Confederacies of his Enemies; and made it his con&s;tant avow'd Practice, or Maxim, to keep the mo&s;t &s;acred Engagements of Treaties no longer than till he had the Op|portunity to break them to his Advantage, and much more to this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Things they a&s;k us now, what &s;ignify all the Treaties and Engagements which the <HI>French</HI> King has made in the Affair of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI>; and what Dependance can we, or ought we to have upon them?</P>
<P>Now it is a Mi&s;take if any Reader ex|pects to find this Tract attempting to take off any of the above Reproaches ca&s;t upon the Honour and Character of the <HI>French</HI> King, his regard to his Word, or holding &s;acred the Engagements he has enter'd into.&mdash;Not at all: This &s;hall be no part of my Ta&s;k; let it go; let it be taken all for gran|ted, if they plea&s;e; or not taken for granted, as you &s;hall plea&s;e.

</LIST></P>
<P>This Que&s;tion has been a&s;k'd before now, and &s;o many abrupt and ab&s;urd An&s;wers have been given to it, that even the Per|&s;ons who have given tho&s;e An&s;wers, de&s;ire not to have the Que&s;tion repeated; and are willing to hear as little of it as they can. Some have an&s;wer'd, the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould have deliver'd him up to us: But this is liable to many Exceptions; and to &s;peak in general only, the be&s;t Friends of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> have declared, they did not de&s;ire to have that Method taken as
<PB N="35" REF="36">
a dangerous Experiment for many Rea&s;ons, &s;ome of them fitter to be gue&s;s'd at than expre&s;s'd. Some have &s;ugge&s;ted, That the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould have cau&s;ed him to be made away privately, rather than to have &s;uffered him&s;elf to be brought to &s;o Di&s;|honourable a Submi&s;&s;ion, as to For&s;ake, and Abandon a Per&s;on who had, from his Infancy, been &s;helter'd under his Pro|tection. But this was too Barbarous and Unho&s;pitable, for even the wor&s;t Enemies of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> if they were Chri&s;tians, to approve of; and no one could maintain it without Horror, even at the &s;ame time that they were for entirely Expelling him from hence. Others &s;ugge&s;ted, That we &s;hould have procur'd him to be Confin'd in the <HI>Pierre Enci&s;e</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where Pri&s;oners for Life are generally &s;ent, near <HI>Lyons</HI>; and that he &s;hould be &s;uffer'd there to end his Days quietly: But this was liable to the &s;ame Objections of the <HI>French</HI> King's break|ing his Word, that the pre&s;ent Articles are liable too; &s;ince he might cau&s;e the Gates to be Opened when ever he thought fit, and might let him out from thence with the &s;ame Ea&s;e that he may now Recall him into his Dominions.</P>
<P>What, then, can we propo&s;e that the King of <HI>France</HI> could have done, in re&s;pect
<PB N="36" REF="37">
to the Di&s;po&s;ing the Per&s;on of the <HI>Pre|tender,</HI> more than fir&s;t having cau&s;ed him, or de&s;ired him (<HI>call it as you plea&s;e</HI>) Vo|luntarily to withdraw out of his Domi|nions; to engage, in the &s;olemne&s;t man|ner, not to admit him to Return thither any more; and no more to own him for ever hereafter under the Titles of King of <HI>Eng|land, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> or, in &s;hort, any of Her Maje&s;ty's Titles and Royal Stile, as he did be|fore.</P>
<P>It is true, The <HI>French</HI> King may break his Word, may renounce the Faith and Honour of a King, pledg'd to Her Maje|&s;ty, and the Faith and Honour of the ve|ry Throne of <HI>France,</HI> which he has en|gaged, as far as in him lies, in the Name of all his Succe&s;&s;ors; and there is no help|ing this: But I do not &s;ee what farther could be done; what more could have been a&s;ked of the King of <HI>France</HI>; or what more he could have granted, to have made us more &s;afe.</P>
<P>Pledges of Towns, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Fron|tiers, and Cautionary Gari&s;ons, could be of no &s;ignification here; neither did ever any one of the other Opinion &s;ay what Town or City they would accept as a
<PB N="37" REF="38">
&s;ufficient Caution, or Pledge, for the Se|curity of his Performance: Nor, indeed, could any thing the <HI>French</HI> King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es have given us the lea&s;t Security in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. On the contrary, had any of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> been made over in a way of Security, or as a Preliminary for the performance of this Negative, and to a&s;&s;ure us, That he never would A&s;&s;i&s;t, or Entertain this <HI>Pretender</HI> again: This would, even it&s;elf, have been a mo&s;t forcible Motive to the <HI>French</HI> King to have broke that very Engagement, and to have made the Attempt, that having &s;et him up here, and obtain'd the Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown for him, He, <HI>the Pretender,</HI> &s;hould clear him, <HI>the</HI> French <HI>King,</HI> of tho&s;e Engagements, and re&s;tore to him tho&s;e Pledges.</P>
<P>Nor in &s;uch a Ca&s;e would there have lain &s;o much of the Charge of a breach of Honour, or a Charge of Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ince he that takes Security is &s;uppo&s;ed not to depend upon the Promi&s;e, or Engagement, but relinqui&s;hing the Honour of the Per|&s;on takes the Equivalent, <HI>viz.</HI> the Pledge for his Satisfaction.</P>
<P>What then, any Amba&s;&s;ador, or Pleni|potentiaries, could have a&s;k'd more than
<PB N="38" REF="39">
the pre&s;ent Treaty has taken: Or, indeed, what could have been propo&s;ed farther to the <HI>French</HI> King to have done for our Security and Satisfaction in this Ca&s;e, re|mains for any to &s;et down that knows, for I do not pretend to it.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>2. How, with &s;afety to the Honour and Re|putation of our Arms, could we aledge, that our Safety again&s;t the <HI>Pretender</HI> was not &s;ufficiently &s;ecured by this?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Safety of <HI>Britain</HI> mu&s;t be e&s;teem'd by us to be very weakly Defended, and our E&s;tabli&s;hment to be in a very preca|rious Condition, if we may &s;uppo&s;e it to depend &s;o entirely upon the <HI>French</HI> King's performance of his Engagements, as that without it we are given up, and lo&s;t to the <HI>Pretender.</HI> Tho&s;e who are thus Flegmatick in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> very much Di&s;honour their own Country, and the Confidence they have either in the Power or Unanimity of the People of <HI>Great Britain</HI>; that they &s;hould think we &s;hould be &s;o much at the Mercy of the <HI>French</HI> King, that when ever he plea&s;es to break his Engagements, we are to be &s;ubdued to the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Pretender.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, The Intere&s;t of the <HI>Preten|der,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="40">
back'd by the Power of the <HI>French</HI> King, is not to be di&s;pi&s;ed; nor the Dan|ger of it to be made light of; and there|fore, every thing that is rea&s;onable and practicable ought to be done, to keep that Apprehen&s;ion off: And the Treaty has made &s;o much Provi&s;ion, that whether it be &s;ufficient or no, it &s;eems to be all that the Nature of the Ca&s;e would admit of; and all that was really practicable in the Thing: To be Flegmatick and Di&s;may'd now, would &s;ugge&s;t to us, that our own Power is of no weight in this Ca&s;e; that we mu&s;t de|pend entirely upon the Conduct of the <HI>French</HI> King to pre&s;erve the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI>; and, that we are to be Happy or Mi&s;erable, ju&s;t as he is, or is not plea&s;ed to be faith|ful to his Engagement.</P>
<P>This, I mu&s;t acknowledge, I think is Complimenting the <HI>French</HI> King too much at our own Expence, and placing the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Strength at &s;o low an Ebb, as no rea&s;on can be given for.</P>
<P><HI>Britain,</HI> or the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> no doubt, were we Hearty and Unanimous in the Intere&s;t of the Nation, are able to keep up the Re&s;olutions already taken in the Affair of the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and are able to Support our own Laws and Con&s;titution
<PB N="40" REF="41">
again&s;t the whole World: And tho' it is highly rea&s;onable that, on a Treaty, the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould engage, as he has done, to relinqui&s;h the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and acknow|ledge the Succe&s;&s;or, yet our Safety is very far from depending entirely on the Perfor|mance of that Engagement; and we ought to be in very little Concern, whether the <HI>French</HI> King will perform his Promi&s;es or not.</P>
<P>The Que&s;tion, therefore, does not &s;o much re&s;t upon this Point, whether the <HI>French</HI> King will perform the Treaty he has made or no; but whether any thing farther could have been done for our Se|curity or no in a Treaty, whether with the <HI>French</HI> King, or any-body el&s;e; what the <HI>French</HI> King could have granted farther, or what we could Honourably to our &s;elves have demanded farther, that we may &s;ee if the People that mady the Treaty have been faithful or no.</P>
<P>I &s;hall readily grant, that if our Securi|ty depends upon the <HI>French</HI> King's per|formance of his Promi&s;es and Engagements, the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> may be a very pre|carious Thing. The Faith and Honour of the be&s;t Princes in the World being too weak a Ba&s;is to build a Thing of that Con&s;equence upon, e&s;pecially while, accor|ding
<PB N="41" REF="42">
to the pre&s;ent Practices, the Faith and Honour of Treaties are always Interpreted by Princes their own way, when they have any Preten&s;ions to make, or find it for their Conveniency to break in upon their Word given.</P>
<P>And for this Rea&s;on tho&s;e People who lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s upon our Treaty with <HI>France,</HI> and place &s;o much weight there, as if the whole, and only Security of our <HI>Prote&s;tant Settlement</HI> depended upon this Treaty; not only Di&s;honour our own Na|tion, but really Weaken the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> it&s;elf. Do &s;uch People know, or con&s;ider, that the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> is our Fundamental Se|curity for the <HI>Peace, Pro&s;perity, Liberty, Pro|perty, Religion, Po&s;terity</HI> of this Nation, and all that is, or can be dear to us, or them, now and for ever? What a Condition &s;hould we be all in, if the&s;e Things, of &s;o much Con&s;equence to us, depended for their Safety, upon the Veracity, Faith, and Honour of the <HI>French</HI> King; aye, or any King upon Earth? Such People have too mean an Opinion of our Con&s;titution, and of our Power to maintain it. It is, no doubt, convenient and &s;afe for us to tye up the Hands of tho&s;e who are Enemies to the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> as far as po&s;&s;ible: And it &s;eems to be as much done that way as it was
<PB N="42" REF="43">
po&s;&s;ible could be done in the Treaty. But when all that is over, we hope the Secu|rity of our E&s;tabli&s;hment has better Foun|dations than any that could be furni&s;hed from Foreign Contracts, or provided in a Treaty with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>As far as Treaty could provide, as far as could either be offer'd by the <HI>French</HI> King, or propo&s;ed by us in a Treaty, &s;eems to be Obtain'd and Settled by this Treaty; and it is yet unknown what tho&s;e People who complain of the In&s;ufficiency of this Treaty, do propo&s;e; either as what might have been done, or as what would have been &s;ufficient if it had been done in the Treaty, I mean as it relates to the <HI>Prote|&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>If then, nothing can be thought of far|ther for the Security of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Suc|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI> which either was in the Power of the <HI>French</HI> King to grant, or which we ought to have accepted from him, or pro|po&s;ed to him, then the pre&s;ent Treaty is as &s;ufficient a Security to the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> as it was po&s;&s;ible to make it be, or as a Treaty could admit.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Thing might be &s;aid in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Renunciations, which
<PB N="43" REF="44">
lay it down as a Foundation, that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> ought to be joyn'd together in the &s;ame Per&s;on; &s;ince then the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or King <HI>Philip</HI> was not driven Out; and that yet it appear'd nece&s;&s;ary to make a Treaty of Peace on all Sides. Nothing more effectual could be devi&s;ed, or propo&s;ed than tho&s;e Renunciations: And however Invalid Re|nunciations have been, in like Ca&s;es, thro' the Accidents that may have happen'd, yet upon a due Examination, it will appear that &s;uch Formal Proceedings are not e&s;teem'd &s;o very In&s;ufficient as we now make them, or &s;o appointed to be broken, as that they cannot be kept; and in the Pro&s;ecution of this Argument there &s;hall be &s;hewn in due time.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the pre&s;ent Renunciations are of a different kind from all that ever were propo&s;ed in an Affair of the like Na|ture, as far as Hi&s;tory can in&s;truct us in the Ca&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That there is &s;omething in the Nature of the Thing, that makes the&s;e Valid; and that tho' all the former Contracts of the like Nature in the World have, or had proved ineffectual, yet that the&s;e cannot do &s;o.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="44" REF="45">3 That King <HI>William</HI> accepted of Re|nunciations, in Ca&s;es of like Nature, as the only Method to bind Princes, in Ca&s;es where other Obligations could not be taken or given.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But the&s;e Things are re&s;erved to a Trea|ti&s;e of the Renunciations, which may be Publi&s;hed by it&s;elf.</P>
