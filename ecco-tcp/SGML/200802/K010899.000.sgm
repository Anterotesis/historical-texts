<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHen I fir&s;t arriv'd in <HI>England,</HI> every one was curious to Di&s;cour&s;e me about my own Country; and fora&s;much as my Account of it was entirely new, they thought it my Duty to publi&s;h it; and I readily comply'd with their Advice, both for my own ea&s;e and their &s;atisfaction. But when I had met with &s;o many Romantic Stories of all tho&s;e remote Ea&s;tern Countries, e&s;pecially of my own, which had been impos'd upon you as undoubted Truths, and univer|&s;ally believed, then I was much di&s;courag'd from proceeding in my De&s;cription of it; yet &s;ince Truth ought to di&s;pel the&s;e Clouds of fabulous Reports, and I cou'd not e&s;cape un|cen&s;ur'd even by my &s;elf, &s;hould I (by my &s;ilence) &s;uffer you to remain in Ignorance, or rather deceiv'd by Mi&s;repre&s;entations, I thought my &s;elf indi&s;pen&s;ably oblig'd to give you a more faithful Hi&s;tory of the I&s;le of
<PB N="ii" REF="8">
<HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> than as yet you have met with. But before I enter upon this Subject, 'tis con|venient I &s;hould premi&s;e &s;ome few things. Since then (as I before ob&s;erved) there are &s;uch various Accounts, and all different from what I &s;hall give you, this is no Rea&s;on for me to expect greater Credit; but I leave it to the unbia&s;s'd Judge to prefer which he plea|&s;eth, for 'tis not &s;o much my Concern to be reputed &s;incere, as 'tis really to be &s;o. But here I mu&s;t entreat you diligently to ob&s;erve what followeth, becau&s;e the Reputation of my Book depends much upon it. In the fir&s;t place there are &s;everal things in their Story which you are oblig'd to &s;u&s;pect, becau&s;e they contradict one another in tho&s;e Matters which every Relater a&s;&s;ures you he has been an Eye-witne&s;s of; &s;ince then their Tale is &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent, there is very little in it that you ought to depend upon. But that I may expo&s;e &s;ome of their Fal&s;hoods, I will &s;treng|then what I a&s;&s;ert by the Authority of &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants trading to <HI>China,</HI> who&s;e Relations are much the &s;ame with mine, but va&s;tly different from theirs. As for exam|ple: <HI>Candidius,</HI> and others, in their Ac|count of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> tell us, there is neither Monarchical nor Democratical Government in the I&s;land; that there is no Law nor Pu|ni&s;hment again&s;t Theft, Adultery, or Mur|ther,
<PB N="iii" REF="9">
and &s;uch black Crimes; but every Man judgeth and revengeth in his own Ca&s;e: For in&s;tance, if a Man rob me of a hundred Pound, I may &s;teal from him as much by way of reprizal. If a Man murthers me, any of my Family, or Friends, may, by the Murther of him revenge mine; and &s;o of Adultery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They tell us farther, that there is no Oeconomy or Order among&s;t the Natives, that they are even Strangers to the di&s;tinction of Ma&s;ter and Servant; that nei|ther Mines of Gold or Silver are to be found there, and that they have no Spices. In an|&s;wer to which, let me tell you, that tho&s;e Merchants I before mention'd, inform us, that there is a Governour to whom they paid large Cu&s;toms for every thing they exported. If then there be a Governour, certainly there mu&s;t be Laws, let <HI>Candidius,</HI> and others, &s;ay what they plea&s;e. That they have Gold, Silver, and Spices al&s;o, is likewi&s;e prov'd by tho&s;e Traders, who have exported va&s;t Sums of the one, and large Quantities of the other.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on it &s;elf is &s;ufficient to confute what they &s;ay of Anarchy in our I&s;land: For how is it po&s;&s;ible for any Kingdom to &s;tand, if no Law or Degrees of Dignity are ob&s;erv'd? Or how can a Community be pre&s;erv'd, if there are no Penal Statutes to correct Offen|ders?
<PB N="iv" REF="10">
In my Opinion, if every one was left to revenge him&s;elf, &s;uch a Place mu&s;t be a continued Scene of Murther and Rapine; e&s;pecially &s;ince the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> (as <HI>Candi|dius,</HI> and others wou'd have you believe) do not look upon the&s;e Facts as mon&s;trous Crimes, but only as little Tricks and <HI>Picca|dillo's.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;ome likewi&s;e that tell you, that the I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> belongs to the Chann of <HI>China;</HI> but if &s;o, why do the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> pay &s;o great Tribute to our Governour? For the truth of this, I dare appeal even to the <HI>Dutch</HI> them&s;elves, who are competent Judges in the Ca&s;e, ever &s;ince the Emperor of <HI>Japan</HI> has given them leave to renew their Trade in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> after they had many Years been bani&s;h'd from thence; as you may &s;ee in the Book, <HI>Chap. 37.</HI> Of the Succe&s;s of the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> I could here al&s;o add much more, which for brevity-&s;ake I omit: For 'tis convincing enough to &s;ay, that he who &s;o gro&s;ly errs in one particular, may rea&s;onably be thought an un|faithful Relater of every thing el&s;e. But whe|ther the&s;e ridiculous Story-Tellers above-men|tion'd, vend their Legends out of a De&s;ign, or for want of a true Knowledge of Matter of Fact, is not my Bu&s;ine&s;s now to enquire.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="v" REF="11">2. The &s;econd thing I wou'd have you take notice of, is, That I pretend not to give you a perfect and complete Hi&s;tory of my I&s;land, becau&s;e I was a meer Youth when I left it, but nineteen Years of Age, and therefore un|capable of giving an exact Account of it: Be&s;ides I have now been &s;ix Years from home, &s;o many things of moment may perhaps &s;lip my Memory which would have adorn'd the De&s;cription of my Country. But what&s;oever I can recollect, I have freely publi&s;h'd; and I a&s;&s;ure you, I have not po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted any thing which is not as po&s;itively true; but if I have &s;aid what I did not know, as a certain Truth, as &s;uch I have admoni&s;h'd you of it. I have di&s;charged my Con&s;cience, receive it as you plea&s;e; for &s;ince I have done my Duty, I &s;hall no more be con|cern'd about it.</P>
<P N="3">3. In my Book I have told you the Rea|&s;ons that mov'd my Country-men to make &s;o great a Slaughter of the Chri&s;tians; for the Je&s;uits then made &s;uch weak Excu&s;es for them&s;elves, that many, not without Rea&s;on, believ'd they had other De&s;igns than what they pretended; I thought it therefore proper to give you from the Records and Tradition of my Country, the be&s;t Account of the&s;e
<PB N="vi" REF="12">
Matters I could. In vain the Je&s;uits a&s;|&s;ign the Envy of our Pagan Prie&s;ts, and the Emulation of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as the Cau&s;es of this Per&s;ecution, &s;uch things could never in|duce us to treat &s;o cruelly all that profe&s;s'd Chri&s;tianity: Certainly there was a Snake in the Gra&s;s, which they would not, but I have di&s;cover'd. I am confident by my revealing this and much more, I &s;hall draw all the Spite and Malice of the Je&s;uits upon me, of which I have already met with a notorious In&s;tance in Father <HI>Fountenay,</HI> who is lately return'd from <HI>China,</HI> having been eighteen Years a Mi&s;&s;ionary there; this Man is now in <HI>London,</HI> and &s;ome Body had told him I was publi&s;hing a Book, in which I &s;peak much again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and e&s;pecially again&s;t the <HI>Je&s;uits:</HI> This has &s;o enrag'd him, that he endeavours by all means imaginable to de&s;troy my Credit, as I am daily inform'd by many Gentlemen; to whom I only reply'd, Let him alone, I am little concern'd at what &s;uch a &s;u&s;picious Per&s;on &s;ays again&s;t me: The truth is, and will be, I hope, evident, notwith&s;tanding his Attempts to &s;tifle it, &s;o I &s;hall apply the Words of the Poet to him,
<Q>Parturiunt montes, na&s;cetur ridiculus mus.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="13">I have had three Conferences with him, without coming to any conclu&s;ion; the fir&s;t was before the Royal Society, on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the &s;econd of this in&s;tant <HI>February,</HI> when there was a Publick Meeting of the illu&s;trious Members of that celebrated Body: That he might the more ea&s;ily defend him&s;elf, he had Notice of my coming: After we had &s;aluted each other, we began our Di&s;cour&s;e. The fir&s;t Que&s;tion that was propos'd to him, was, To whom doth the I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> belong? He pre&s;ently reply'd, It was tributary to the Emperor of <HI>China.</HI> Some of the Gentlemen ask'd him how he knew it to be &s;o; he quick|ly an&s;wer'd, That a certain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship call'd the <HI>Harwich,</HI> was by &s;tormy Weather forc'd upon the Shore of <HI>Formo&s;a;</HI> that five Je&s;uits were Pa&s;&s;engers in it, one of them was drown'd, the other four e&s;cap'd to the I&s;land, from whence they &s;ent Letters to this Father <HI>Fontenay,</HI> who then was in a cer|tain City in <HI>China.</HI> Father <HI>Fontenay</HI> writes to the Chann, or Emperor; the Chann &s;ends a Letter to the <HI>Formo&s;ans,</HI> demanding them and the Ship; and &s;o the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> were compell'd to re&s;tore both them and the Ship, I an&s;wer'd, That this Story was nothing to the purpo&s;e; for &s;ince we are not at Wars with the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> if any of their Ships &s;hould be driven on our Coast, and the Chann &s;hould
<PB N="viii" REF="14">
reclaim them, altho' we live not in his Do|minions, we are in Ju&s;tice oblig'd to re&s;tore them: And thus I then an&s;wered his Story. But it appears &s;ince by the Te&s;timony of &s;eve|ral Merchants, that the afore-mentioned Ship was ca&s;t upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>China,</HI> and not of <HI>Formo&s;a:</HI> Had I known as much then, I would before the illu&s;trious Society have dete|cted the Fal&s;hood of the Je&s;uit; but mi&s;tru&s;t|ing he might be mi&s;taken in the Name of the the Place, and take another I&s;land for <HI>For|mo&s;a,</HI> I de&s;ir'd him to tell me by what Name the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> call'd <HI>Formo&s;a;</HI> he an&s;wer'd, That he knew no other Name for it but <HI>For|mo&s;a,</HI> or <HI>Tyowan;</HI> but it's very plain, not only from what I <HI>(who &s;hould know be&s;t)</HI> a&s;&s;ert, but al&s;o from a certain Gentleman who has been in <HI>Tyowan,</HI> that it is an I&s;land &s;omewhat remote and di&s;tinct from ours, and is now a Colony belonging to the before|mention'd <HI>Dutch.</HI> This indeed he confe&s;s'd he was ignorant of. I told him farther, That the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> call our I&s;land by the Name of <HI>Pak-Ando,</HI> which agrees with <HI>Gad-Avia,</HI> as we call it, both which &s;ignifie the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a. Pak, Pak,</HI> &s;ays he, there is not &s;uch a word in the whole <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Language, that ended with a Con&s;onant as <HI>Pak</HI> doth; which is very fal&s;e, for the Name of almo&s;t all their great Cities end with a Con&s;onant,
<PB N="ix" REF="15">
as <HI>Nanking, Kanton, Peking,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>2.</HI> When at my de&s;ire he di&s;cours'd in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Language, near half his Words terminated with Con&s;onants: This was &s;o plain a Con|tradiction, that all the Auditory ob&s;erv'd it. At the &s;ame Meeting al&s;o he deny'd there was any variety of Languages, or Dialects, thro' the whole Empire of <HI>China,</HI> but that all the Natives &s;poke with one and the &s;ame Tongue; which when it was demon&s;trated to be fal&s;e by many then pre&s;ent, he made no manner of Reply, only unrea&s;onably and ob|&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted in affirming what he before had &s;aid. At length, that if po&s;&s;ible I might make the matter yet more plain, I told him, Either what all the Je&s;uits, and others, had written of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Language, was not true, or what he &s;aid mu&s;t be fal&s;e; for they a&s;&s;ure us, the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> in every Province &s;peak various Dialects, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> the Lord's Prayer in a hundred Languages.</NOTE> and they have diffe|rent Languages, according to their Degrees or Quality; as for in&s;tance, the Noble-men &s;peak the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Language; the Bonzees, or Prie&s;ts, u&s;e another for the Divine Service, which is unintelligible to the Lay-People; and the Plebeans a third; &s;o that I told him, either they, or he, (pardon the expre&s;&s;ion) mu&s;t lye gro&s;ly: But he endeavour'd by im|pertinent
<PB N="x" REF="16">
Shifts to excu&s;e him&s;elf. He de|ny'd al&s;o, that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> had any Tone in their Speech by which they di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ig|nification of a word: This I likewi&s;e affirm'd to be fal&s;e: For I have, in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> heard many <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> talking together; but they &s;eem'd to me rather to &s;ing than di&s;cour&s;e; be&s;ides, this contradicts what the Je&s;uits them&s;elves tell us. At length, after &s;o many Interruptions, we ended our Confe|rence: Let the Reader judge who had the better.</P>
<P>I have &s;ince had two A&s;&s;ignations to meet him, once at my Lady <HI>Powis</HI>'s, another time at <HI>Sion</HI>-College; but he fail'd to an&s;wer the Appointments.</P>
<P>Eight Days after, being <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the Ninth of <HI>February,</HI> I was to Dine with Dr. <HI>Sloane,</HI> Secretary to the Royal Society; where were pre&s;ent the Right Honourable my Lord <HI>Pembroke;</HI> his Excellency, <HI>Spanhe|mins,</HI> the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s Envoy; another Noble-man, and this Father <HI>Fontenay;</HI> when he was ask'd by his Excellency, to whom the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> belong'd; he re|ply'd, Here is a young Man, (pointing to me) who is a Native of that Country, he can better inform you than I, who have only been
<PB N="xi" REF="17">
in <HI>China.</HI> I then an&s;wer'd him, that it did belong to the Emperor of <HI>Japan.</HI> We had nothing el&s;e remarkable in this Confe|rence; neither had he the A&s;&s;urance at this time to &s;ay any thing more to me: He wondred indeed to &s;ee me eat raw Fle&s;h; becau&s;e, &s;ays he, the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> dre&s;s their Meat after the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Europe|ans,</HI> tho' at the &s;ame time he confe&s;s'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> differ'd from them in their Cookery; for they only warm'd their Fle&s;h before they eat it.</P>
<P>A third time I met him in the <HI>Temple</HI>-Coffee-Hou&s;e in <HI>Devereux</HI>-Court in the <HI>Strand,</HI> near <HI>Temple-Bar,</HI> where &s;everal Noble-men were pre&s;ent; and there he ask'd me the Manner, Time, and Rea&s;ons of my leaving my Country; and I rightly informed him: Neither had he the Face to rai&s;e any Obje|ctions, unle&s;s that he never knew Father <HI>de Rhode,</HI> who brought me out of my Coun|try.</P>
<P>I am well inform'd he takes a great deal of freedom in a&s;per&s;ing me; but I &s;hall re|turn him no other An&s;wer than that of the Mendicant Friar, to &s;ome fal&s;e Accu|&s;ations again&s;t him, <HI>Mentitur impuden|ti&s;&s;im&eacute;.</HI> But &s;ure 'tis much more becoming
<PB N="xii" REF="18">
a Man of Probity to &s;peak openly, and Face to Face, than thus clande&s;tinely to backbite and calumniate. I have ju&s;t touch'd upon this Subject, that you may &s;ee how much this Narrative will incen&s;e the Je&s;uits a|gain&s;t me; but I tru&s;t that Providence which &s;o often has deliver'd me out of their Hands, will fru&s;trate all their De&s;igns and Contri|vances, that I may &s;ay with the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t, He &s;hall reward Evil unto mine Enemies: de&s;troy thou them in thy Truth,</HI> P&s;al. <HI>54.</HI> v. <HI>5.</HI></P>
<P>I fear this trifling Performance will not be very acceptable to you, becau&s;e 'tis not &s;o elegant and polite as you perhaps might wi&s;h; I was &s;en&s;ible of my own Weakne&s;s and In|capacity for it, and therefore depend upon your Goodne&s;s to pardon my Errors, and &s;up|ply my Defects; elegant Expre&s;&s;ions, and pomp of Words, are not to be expected from a raw and unpoli&s;h'd <HI>Japane&s;e.</HI> But &s;ince I wrote this Treati&s;e in <HI>Latine,</HI> that it might be afterwards turn'd into <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and oblig'd the Tran&s;lator to make no Ad|ditions or Alterations, 'tis mine, and not his Fault, if you meet with any Imperfecti|ons in it.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="19">It was tran&s;lated out of <HI>Latin</HI> by Mr <HI>O&s;wald,</HI> except from <HI>Page 94.</HI> to <HI>144.</HI> which part I wrote in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and was prepar'd for the Pre&s;s by another Hand.</P>
<P>I thought it might not be ami&s;s to begin with an Account of my Travels and Conver|&s;ion, which will (I hope) afford you &s;ome things that are entertaining.</P>
<P>'Tis not my delight, but my grief, that I am obliged to publi&s;h my Arguments again&s;t tho&s;e Religions which I could not conform to, becau&s;e &s;ome perhaps will interpret what I have &s;aid to reflect upon them; but that was far from my intentions, who only de|&s;ign'd to give you my Rea&s;ons why I could not &s;ub&s;cribe to them; which if they plea&s;e not others, yet they do abundantly &s;atisfie me, e&s;pecially &s;ince I as yet was tinctur'd with the Prejudices of the Idolatry I was educated in. Far be it from me to con|demn any Man; but as I &s;aid before, I only acquaint you, that the&s;e things were of|fen&s;ive to me, which perhaps are not &s;o to others.</P>
<P>Now to the Omnipotent and All-wi&s;e GOD, I return my mo&s;t humble Thanks,
<PB N="xiv" REF="20">
who by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Holy Spirit, has brought me to the knowledge of that Reli|gion in which only Salvation is to be found, and to that Chri&s;tian Communion which is mo&s;t conformable to the In&s;titutions of our Saviour: To whom be all Honour and Prai&s;e now and for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

that Place, and after this the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and other <HI>Mi&s;&s;ionaries,</HI> being encourag'd by the kind Reception they met with, flock'd in great Numbers to <HI>Japan,</HI> and there boldly profe&s;s'd and propagated the Chri&s;tian Faith, with good &s;ucce&s;s, for many years: But &s;ince the Emperour of <HI>Japan,</HI> about the year 1616, (for certain rea&s;ons hereafter mention'd) has forbidden any Chri&s;tian to come into his Dominions under pain of Death, and hath appointed Searchers in e|very City to examine all Forreigners, whe|ther they be Chri&s;tians or no, by this te&s;t, of Trampling upon the Crucifix; the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and other Mi&s;&s;ionaries of the <HI>Romi&s;h-Church,</HI> are &s;o far from venturing to appear there bare-fac'd, or making publick Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and endeavour|ing to make Pro&s;elites, to it, that they in|du&s;triou&s;ly mask them&s;elves under &s;everal di&s;gui&s;es, le&s;t they &s;hould be known to be Chri&s;tians or Forreigners. And to this end they fir&s;t Travel to <HI>Goa, where there are Aca|demies in which all the Oriental Languages are Taught</HI>; and after they have Perfectly Learn'd the <HI>Japane&s;e</HI> Language, and can &s;peak it as ea&s;ily and readily as any Native, Then they Cloth them&s;elves in a <HI>Japan</HI> Ha|bit, and &s;o they venture to Travel into &s;ome I&s;land within the Dominions of the Empire
<PB N="3" REF="26">
of <HI>Japan.</HI> When they are come there, they pretend to be Natives of &s;ome other I&s;land in the &s;ame Empire&punc; which is ea&s;ily be|liev'd to be true by the Inhabitants, who have no &s;u&s;picion of them, becau&s;e they &s;peak their Language exactly, and wear their Cloths after the mode of the Country. And thus having &s;ecur'd their admi&s;&s;ion in|to a City with &s;afety, their next bu&s;ine&s;s is to prevent any umbrage of &s;u&s;picion which may ari&s;e from their idle way of living, and to this purpo&s;e they &s;eem as much con|cern'd for &s;ome Trade, or Employment, as if they really wanted means of Sub&s;i&s;tance. Thus &s;ome &s;et up for Merchants, Artificers, or Toy-&s;ellers, others for School-ma&s;ters or Pedagogues, to teach the Natives Children &s;ome Language they want to learn: And &s;o every one acts his part, and Cloaks him|&s;elf with &s;ome di&s;gui&s;e, le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;|cover'd to be a Forreigner, and con&s;equent|ly be oblig'd to trample upon the Crucifix. By this means they continue &s;ecurely and free from danger, in any City of <HI>Japan, for the &s;pace of four years,</HI> which is the time allotted by their Superiors for their &s;tay in tho&s;e parts; after which time they are oblig'd to return to their own Country, and give place to other Mi&s;&s;ionaries who are then &s;ent to &s;ucceed them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="27">Among the re&s;t, there was a certain <HI>Je&s;u|it</HI> of <HI>Avignon,</HI> who&s;e true Name was Fa|ther <HI>de Rode,</HI> de&s;cended of an Honourable Family, who after he had learned the <HI>Japa|ne&s;e Language</HI> at the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Goa,</HI> came into the I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> about the Year 1694, which <HI>was then and had been for &s;ome years Subject to the Empire of Japan</HI>; and, be|ing better qualified to be a Tutor to young Men than for any other Employment, he gave out, that he was a Native of <HI>Japan,</HI> de|&s;cended of a rich Father, and that all his e&s;tate was divided among four Wives, and 13 Sons, he had left behind him, be&s;ides Daughters; that he being the younge&s;t, the Portion which fell to his &s;hare was &s;o &s;mall, that he was forc'd, at Twenty Years of Age, to leave his Fathers Hou&s;e, and Travel abroad, to get a Lively-hood by teaching the Latin Tongue. Which he had been taught; and that for this end he was come to <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> after he had been in &s;everal other parts of <HI>Japan</HI>; by chance this Story happen'd to come to my Father's Ears, who &s;ent for him, and after he had &s;een and di&s;cour&s;ed him, he took him for a Learned and well-di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;on; and therefore re&s;olv'd to take him into his Hou&s;e to teach <HI>me the Latin Tongue.</HI> My Fa+ther acquainted me with the de&s;ign, and told me that I &s;hould give over the <HI>Learning of
<PB N="5" REF="28">
the Greek Tongue,</HI> which I was then, Studying becau&s;e I might Learn it at any time in our own Academies, and that I mu&s;t make u&s;e of the pre&s;ent opportunity of Learning the La|tin Tongue by this Man, becau&s;e he did not know when he &s;hould meet with the like opportunity. I readily &s;ubmitted to my Fa|ther's Commands, as in Duty bound, and Father <HI>de Rode</HI> &s;eem'd to be as glad of the opportunity as we were. My Father of|fer'd to allow him yearly 17 <HI>Copans</HI> for in&s;tructing me in the Latin Tongue, be&s;ides Diet and Cloths, which he accept|ed of; and &s;o a Bargain was &s;truck be|tween them: Now a <HI>Copan</HI> is one pound weight in Gold, which in Engli&s;h Money, according to our way of value, is about &s;ix Crowns.</P>
<P>After this he came and liv'd at my Fa|thers Hou&s;e in <HI>Xternet&s;a</HI> the Capital City of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> for the &s;pace of four Years, and be|hav'd him&s;elf &s;o well in all re&s;pects towards my Father and my &s;elf, that we were both very well &s;atisfi'd with him. He accompanied me to all places whither I went, except when I entred into our Temples, for then he always left me at the Gate, becau&s;e, as he pretended, he being a <HI>Japanner</HI> was of a different Religion, from that which was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> and there|fore,
<PB N="6" REF="29">
he &s;aid, he would return home and wor&s;hip his God after his own way. In the mean time he took care to in&s;truct me <HI>in all the Articles of our Religion, as exactly as</HI> if he had believ'd it him&s;elf, and never &s;poke &s;o much to me as one word of Chri&s;tianity; and indeed he <HI>employed his whole time</HI> and pains in Teaching me the Latin Tongue, and in&s;tructing me in the Principles of our Faith, and of Moral Hone&s;ty: In fine, he appear'd to me, in all his di&s;cour&s;e and acti|ons, to be a Per&s;on of &s;o great probity, hon|e&s;ty and candor, that I lov'd him almo&s;t as well as my Father. But at length, after four Years were expir'd, when I had acquir'd a competent knowledge in the Latin Tongue, he received Letters whereby he was oblig'd to return into his own Country; and there|fore he begg'd the Favour of me, that I would acquaint my Father with his de&s;ign of going away, and pray him, on his behalf, that he would di&s;mi&s;s him, and pay him the Salary that was due to him, according to the Agreement made between them; I lov'd him &s;o well, that I was mightily troubled to hear of his departure, and therefore, being ignorant of the &s;ecret Mi&s;tery of his Mi&s;|&s;ion, I did all that I could to divert him from leaving the place; but he declard
<PB N="7" REF="30">
that he was fully re&s;olv'd to be gone, and Travel over the World, and &s;ee all other other Countries, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e that were Chri&s;tian, which he extoll'd above all o|thers, commending them highly upon &s;everal accounts, which <HI>I afterwards found to be fal&s;e</HI>; In an&s;wer to this I told him, &s;miling, what are you mad to go among the Chri&s;tians, where you will be kill'd for your Religion, as we kill them here upon the account of theirs: But he very &s;eriou&s;ly affirmed the contrary, and a&s;&s;ured me that the Chri&s;tians were very good Men, and that they were &s;o far from any Cruelty, that they were al|ways kind and generous to Strangers, and entertain'd them very Civilly and Nobly. Be&s;ides, he told me, that he did not believe tho&s;e Men who were formerly in <HI>Japan,</HI> to be true Chri&s;tians, as they pretended them|&s;elves to be, for, <HI>&s;aid he, I have di&s;cours'd with many</HI> Japanners <HI>who</HI> have been in Chri|&s;tian Countries, and they mightily com|mended both the Country and the Inhabi|tants; for the Country &s;aid they was the mo&s;t Plea&s;ant place in the World, and the Chri&s;tian Natives gave them a very honourable reception, they &s;howed them all the Curio&s;ities of Art and Nature that were in tho&s;e Parts, and when they came away, the Chri&s;tians &s;o loaded them with Gifts and
<PB N="8" REF="31">
Pre&s;ents, that they returned home to their own Country with great Riches; upon which accounts the &s;ame <HI>Japanners</HI> continue &s;till to Prai&s;e the Chri&s;tians, and their Coun|tries. My Tutor added farther, that in the&s;e Countries there is great plenty of tho&s;e things which are here very &s;carce and pre|cious, and be&s;ides there are many curious and valuable things in the Chri&s;tian Coun|tries, which were never &s;een nor known in <HI>Japan</HI> or <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI> La&s;tly, he told me, that he would not &s;tay any long time in Chri&s;t|endom, but only for the &s;pace of two or three Years at mo&s;t, that he intended to &s;pend three Years in his Travels, for a&s;&s;oon as he departed hence he would go to <HI>China,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and after he had continued &s;ome time in the&s;e parts, he re&s;olved to &s;ail for <HI>Africa,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Europe,</HI> and there, continued he, I &s;hall &s;ee <HI>Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Holland</HI> &amp;c. The wor&s;t of which is more Beautiful and plea&s;ant than this I&s;land of <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI> And at length after I have Travelled over all the parts of the known World, which are mo&s;t Celebrated, either for the Curio&s;ities of Nature, or the im|provements of Arts and Sciences, I &s;hall re|turn home to my own Native Country, full Freighted with the Riches and experience I
<PB N="9" REF="32">
have gained, and then I &s;hall have nothing el&s;e to do, but to &s;pend the remaining part of my Life in Mirth and good Company, for all Per&s;ons of Ingenuity will be glad to &s;ee me, and delight to hear me di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;trange Rarities I have ob&s;erved in o|ther Countries, of their different and &s;ur|pri&s;ing Manners and Cu&s;toms; of their Laws and Politicks in time of Peace and War, of the wonderful improvments of Arts be|yond what is known in our Native Coun|try, of their Methods of Trade and Com|merce; And la&s;tly, of the &s;everal Notable Accidents which happened to me in my Travels: And by the&s;e &s;o Plea&s;ant and u&s;eful Relations, I &s;hall Purcha&s;e to my&s;elf great Honour and E&s;teem. The&s;e things he repre&s;ented to me with &s;uch enticing Circum&s;tances, that I could not but think with my &s;elf he had a mind to per&s;wade me to go along with him, and I being then a young Man, about 19 Years of Age, was the more ea&s;ily prevailed upon: For by the allurements he mentioned, he did &s;o &s;trike my Fancy, and excite my Curio&s;ity of &s;ee|ing the Chri&s;tian Countries he &s;o much commended, that I could not forbear to tell him, That if there was no Danger, but we might &s;afely return again after five or &s;ix Years into our Native Country;
<PB N="10" REF="33">
I had a great mind to be his Compani|on, and Travel with him thro' all the&s;e Countries; But he, di&s;&s;embling his de&s;ign upon me, &s;eem'd to be very aver&s;e to my Propo&s;al, and told me in a feigned Pa&s;&s;ion, God forbid, that ever I &s;hould entice you a|way from your Father's Hou&s;e, If he &s;hould know that I had any &s;uch De&s;ign, what could I expect, but that he would pre&s;ently put me to Death, and therefore I pray you, continued he, talk no more to me of any &s;uch things: But after he had inflamed my de&s;ire of &s;eeing of the fore&s;aid Countries, by the charming pro&s;pect he gave of them, this &s;eeming refu&s;al did rather irritate than extingui&s;h my Curio&s;ity, and therefore I was &s;till the more importunate that I might ac|company him in his Travels; and to remove his jealou&s;ies and fears, I promi&s;ed him very &s;eriou&s;ly, that I would never &s;peak one word of our de&s;ign to any Soul alive, but carry it on with the greate&s;t Secrecy that his own Heart could wi&s;h. But notwith&s;tanding my pro|mi&s;es he &s;till &s;eemed to continue backwards and unwilling to con&s;ent to my de&s;ire, up|on account of the danger that attended him, which provoked me to repeat with greater earne&s;tne&s;s my Solemn a&s;&s;everations and vows of Secrecy and Fidelity; until at la&s;t af|ter a long Conference, and reiterated &s;upplica|tions
<PB N="11" REF="34">
and a&s;&s;urances, he conde&s;cended to tell me plainly, that he had always a great opi|nion of my Candor and Sincerity, and he be|lieved I had &s;ome re&s;pect for him, (as in|deed I had a great Love and honour for him) that now he was re&s;olved to &s;how the great confidence he had in me, by put|ting his Life in my Hands, which he looked upon as the &s;tronge&s;t obligation to Fidelity, and therefore continued he, &s;ince you are &s;o urgent to be my Fellow-traveller, I am willing to take you along with me; but then you mu&s;t be &s;ure to be very cautious, and manage all things &s;o &s;ecretly, that no|thing may happen which will give the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of our de&s;ign. After the main matter was thus agreed between us, he u&s;ed great Freedom with me, in concerting the manner of our E&s;cape, and &s;ecuring &s;ome part of a Fund for Sub&s;i&s;ting us in our Tra|vels. To this purpo&s;e, he told me one day, in our private Conver&s;ation, your Father is a rich Man and has great plenty of Gold both in Money and Goods, and &s;ince we are to undertake &s;o long and expen&s;ive a Voyage, it will be very convenient that we &s;hould take a good quantity of this Gold along with us, which will help to defray our Ex|pences; but then to prevent all Danger of Di&s;covery, nothing of this nature mu&s;t be at|tempted,
<PB N="12" REF="35">
till &s;uch time as we intend to make our e&s;cape; and then about midnight we &s;hall &s;eize upon all the Gold and Money we can &s;afely come at, and pack up our Bagage, and march off to the <HI>next Port, were we may have a Ship.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus fix'd our matters, when the time appointed came, I made ready to be gone, and carried off with me, (be&s;ides o|ther Nece&s;&s;aries for our Journey) 25 pound weight in Gold, partly in Money and partly in <HI>&V;ten&s;ils; viz.</HI> one piece of coin'd Gold, call'd <HI>Rockmo</HI> weighing; 8 pounds 3 <HI>Copans,</HI> whereof each being a piece of coin'd Gold weighs 1 pound; and 14 pound weight of Gold in Uten&s;ils, as Pots, Plates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be&s;ides what I took in Silver and Steel Money, to the value of 600 Crowns or thereabout. With this Stock of Gold and Money, my Tutor and I &s;et forth, having left all my Father's Family fa&s;t a&s;leep, and we arrived about midnight at a Port of the Sea, called by the <HI>Formo&s;ans Khadzey,</HI> which is di&s;tant from my Father's Hou&s;e, in <HI>Xter|net&s;a,</HI> about Nine <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles: And there I met with one of my Fathers <HI>Baleons</HI> or Gallies, and commanded the Steers-Man to carry me to <HI>Luconia,</HI> pretending I had earne&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;patch there for my Father. <HI>Luconia</HI> is the chief of the <HI>Philippine</HI> I&s;les, di&s;tant from
<PB N="13" REF="36">
<HI>Khadzey</HI> about 100 Leagues, where we &s;tay'd about Eight Days, during which time, I kept the Steers Man and all the Marriners there, le&s;t they &s;hould return back and ac|quaint my Father where I was: And after Eight Days we found a Ship going to <HI>Goa,</HI> in which we embark'd, and arriv'd at <HI>Goa,</HI> di&s;tant from <HI>Luconia</HI> about a 1000 Leagues. There we continued about &s;ix Weeks, du|ring which time we were very Civily and Nobly treated in the Mona&s;tery of the Je|&s;uits, which my Tutor told me, was a Hou&s;e built by the Chri&s;tians for entertain|ing Forreigners, and indeed by the kind reception we met with there, he did in &s;ome mea&s;ure convince me of the truth of what he had formerly told me in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> about the Probity and Genero&s;ity of the Chri&s;tians. After &s;ix weeks were expir'd, we went a board on Ship that was going from <HI>Goa</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> and arriv'd at <HI>Gibralter,</HI> in the &s;pace of Nine or Ten Months, where I was forced to &s;tay for the &s;pace of five Weeks, being very much indi&s;po&s;ed by the change of Climates, Air and Diet. At length after my Recovery we &s;ailed from <HI>Gibralter</HI> towards <HI>Toulon,</HI> which is a Sea-Port-Town in <HI>France,</HI> where I &s;aw a great many &s;everal &s;orts of Monks in different Habits, which &s;eem'd &s;trange to me, where|upon
<PB N="14" REF="37">
I ask'd my Tutor who the&s;e Men were, who told me they were Men come from different parts of the World for Trade and Commerce; and that every one of them wore the Habit of his own Country. And as we pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Thoulon, Mar&s;eils</HI> and <HI>Aix,</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> I ob&s;erved a great many Cro&s;&s;es on the Road, which moved me to tell my Tutor; &s;urely there mu&s;t be a great many Thieves in this Country where there are &s;o many Gallows; but he an|&s;wer'd, that the&s;e Gallows were only in|tended to fright Thieves and Robbers, by the Terror of &s;uch a violent Death. And we arrived at la&s;t at <HI>Avignon,</HI> before I knew my Tutor to be a Chri&s;tian: But af|ter we went into the Mona&s;tery of the Je|&s;uits there; when I perceived the Porter call him by his Name, &s;how him great re&s;pect, and talk to him in their Langage, I began to doubt of my Tutor whether he were not a Chri&s;tian; and when I &s;aw all the Fathers of the Convent come to him, &s;alute him, and congratulate his &s;afe Return; and after that, all his Kindred, and la&s;tly all the No|ble Men and Gentlemen of the City, came to vi&s;it him, and expre&s;s their great joy for his &s;afe Arrival; I could no longer keep &s;ilence, but ask'd him, Whether he had not been here before? How it came to pa&s;s

that &s;o many People in this City received him very gladly, and pray'd him to tell the me truth how the matter &s;tood.

<PB N="16" REF="39">
However, this Di&s;cour&s;e made me very thoughtful and anxious, and when I reflected &s;eriou&s;ly upon my condition, and the great danger to which I was reduc'd, I was &s;o a&s;toni&s;h'd, that I knew not what to &s;ay or do: Yet I concluded with my &s;elf, it would be my &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t way, to give my Tutor and the re&s;t of the Fathers good Words, and carry my &s;elf fairly towards them, le&s;t they &s;hould treat me after the &s;ame way as we do the Chri&s;tians in our Country; of which I was &s;ometimes very apprehen&s;ive. At length to &s;how my &s;elf tractable, and gain their good Opinion, I made them this frank offer, That if they could &s;how me greater Evidence for the truth of their Religion, than I could &s;how for the truth of mine, I was ready to re|nounce my own Religion and embrace theirs. Father <HI>de Rode</HI> pre&s;ently accepted of this Propo&s;al, hoping I would yield to his Arguments upon the fir&s;t on&s;et: But to procure him&s;elf the greater Glory, he gave out that I was the Son of a King, <HI>(how truly God knows),</HI> and that I had accompanied him into <HI>Europe,</HI> out of a de&s;ire I had to embrace the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>There were only three ways by which they could hope to make a Convert of me, by Arguments and Demon&s;trative Proofs,
<PB N="17" REF="40">
by flattering In&s;inuations and fair Promi&s;es, or by Threats and Violence. By Argu|ments they could not convince me, for I was able to &s;how <HI>greater ab&s;urdities</HI> in their Religion than they could prove in mine; and particularly, in their Doctrine of Tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation; Again&s;t which I argu'd &s;e|veral ways: As, Fir&s;t from the Te&s;timony of our Sen&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> of &s;eeing, feeling, ta&s;t|ing, all which do a&s;&s;ure us, that it is Bread, which we receive in the Sacrament and not Fle&s;h: If therefore we believe our Sen|&s;es, we cannot believe that the Sub&s;tance of the Bread is chang'd into the natural Fle&s;h of Chri&s;t, which is corporally pre&s;ent in this Sacrament: And then I prov'd that we mu&s;t believe the Te&s;timony of our Sen|&s;es; becau&s;e upon them depends the cer|tainty of the Relations we have concern|ing the Miracles wrought by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the confirmation of his Doctrine: For if tho&s;e who were Eye-witne&s;&s;es, could not be certain by their Sen&s;es, that &s;uch Mi|racles were wrought, as are related in the Life of Chri&s;t, than we have no certainty of the truth of the&s;e Relations which de|pends upon the Te&s;timony of tho&s;e Eye-witne&s;&s;es, who affirm that they &s;aw &s;uch Miracles wrought by Chri&s;t, and con&s;e|quently all the Evidence for the truth of
<PB N="18" REF="41">
Chri&s;tianity, from the Miracles pretended to be wrought in confirmation of it, is &s;ub|verted and de&s;troyed. Thus the belief of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Belief of the&s;e Miracles; for if we believe them we mu&s;t allow the Te&s;timony of Sen&s;e to be a &s;ufficient proof of them; But if we believe Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation we mu&s;t renounce our Sen&s;es, and deny them to be a certain proof of any thing we &s;ee or feel.</P>
<P>Secondly, I argu'd, That their Doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tanatition mu&s;t be fal&s;e; becau&s;e the &s;ame Body cannot, at the &s;ame time, be in two di&s;tant places: But according to their Doctrine, the &s;ame Body of Chri&s;t was cor|porally pre&s;ent in a 1000 di&s;tant places at the &s;ame time, <HI>viz.</HI> in all tho&s;e places where this Sacrament is Celebrated, over the face of the whole Earth, however di&s;tant and remote from one another. Their di&s;tincti|on which they applied to this Argument, That the &s;ame Body could not be in more places than one <HI>Circum&s;criptive,</HI> but only <HI>Definitive,</HI> appear'd to me frivolous and im|pertinent; for &s;till it appeared to me impo&s;|&s;ible, that the &s;ame Body &s;hould be Cor|porally pre&s;ent (tho' it were only <HI>Definitive</HI> as they called it) in &s;everal di&s;tant places at the &s;ame time; for then the &s;ame Body
<PB N="19" REF="42">
might be kill'd and dead in one place, while it was alive in another.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I argu'd, That when Chri&s;t &s;aid at the In&s;titution of this Sacrament, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me,</HI> he &s;uppo&s;ed that he would be ab&s;ent from them when they &s;hould Celebrate this Sacrament; for it is neither nece&s;&s;ary nor u&s;ual to remem|ber a Friend pre&s;ent, but only one that is ab&s;ent; And therefore, the&s;e words of Chri&s;t, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me,</HI> do plainly imply, that he is not Bodily pre&s;ent (in this Sacrament.) I argu'd that their Doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation could not be true, becau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;ed, that the ac|cidents of Bread (as they call them) re|mained without the Sub&s;tance, and the Sub&s;tance of Chri&s;t's Fle&s;h was corporally pre&s;ent without the accidents that are pe|culiar to Fle&s;h, both which appeared to me impo&s;&s;ible: For I cannot conceive how the whitene&s;s of Bread can &s;ub&s;i&s;t, when there is nothing that is white, and how there can be the Sub&s;tance of Fle&s;h, which can neither be &s;een, felt nor ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ome of the Arguments I urg'd again&s;t their Doctrine of Tran&s;ub|&s;tantiation, to which I could never receive a Satisfactory An&s;wer, and tho' they al|ledg'd &s;everal Arguments to turn me from
<PB N="20" REF="43">
Heatheni&s;m; yet becau&s;e I thought there were greater ab&s;urdities in their Religion than they could &s;hew in mine, I &s;till ad|hered to my own Religion. And there|fore finding that by Arguments they could not prevail, they attempted to bribe my Affections, and &s;o win me over to their Party, by many fair Promi&s;es, and wheed|ling In&s;inuations; But I <HI>knew &s;o well their In&s;incerity and cheating Tricks,</HI> by their coun|terfeiting them&s;elves to be Heathens in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> and by breaking their Promi&s;e of allowing me Liberty of Con&s;cience, that I could put no Confidence in any Promi&s;es they made me. And be&s;ides, I very well knew, that I could have more Riches and Honour, if I &s;hould return into my own Native Country, than I could expect from them. In fine, the earne&s;t de&s;ire and probable hope I had of returning to my Father, being join'd with the fear of continuing in this remote Country, far di|&s;tant from my Relations, among Strangers and Hypocrites, made me flight all the offers they made me: Which induced them at la&s;t to u&s;e Threats and Violence; and the&s;e I endur'd with great meekne&s;s, and endea|vour'd to mittigate their Anger with &s;oft words, while in the mean time, I was con|triving and preparing, by the mo&s;t probable
<PB N="21" REF="44">
means I could think of to make my e&s;|cape out of their Hands.</P>
<P>I continued at <HI>Avignon</HI> for the &s;pace of 15 Months, &s;ix in the Mona&s;tery of the Je&s;uits, and nine in other places: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See the Appendix.</NOTE> While I continued in the Mona&s;tery, I found they were continually tea&s;ing and per&s;ecuting me with Enticements, and Arguments to embrace their Religion, and therefore to get rid of them, I pretended a great de&s;ire to hear their publick Prelections, for which end I went &s;ometimes to their Schools of Philo&s;ophy, and &s;ometimes of Theology. But being &s;till liable to their trouble&s;ome Solicitations, at la&s;t I left the Mona&s;tery, and took a private Lodging in the City, where I lived at my own proper Charges: And becau&s;e they had a great part of my Money in their Hands, which they thought I would not leave behind me, they gave me leave to &s;atisfie my Curio&s;ity, and ram|ble over the Countries round about, which I did, travelling from City to City, for the &s;pace of &s;ix Months: After I returned to <HI>Avignon</HI> again, I continued there only for the &s;pace of three Months, from the time I fir&s;t took a private Lodging in that City. And they welcom'd me, and &s;eem'd at fir&s;t to receive me very kindly, but when they found that I put off from Day to Day, to
<PB N="22" REF="45">
declare my &s;elf a Convert, then they begun to attack me more clo&s;ely, and told me plainly, We have waited a long time to receive you into the Bo&s;om of the Catholick Church, and u&s;ed many arguments to con|vince you of the truth of our Religion, but &s;ince you &s;till continue ob&s;tinate, we mu&s;t de&s;ire you to take notice, that we can no longer bear with your delays; for hitherto we have entreated the Fathers Inqui&s;itors that they would not give you any trouble, which they have forbore to do upon our reque&s;t: But now &s;ince you have rejected all the fair means that we have u&s;ed for &s;o long a time for your Conver&s;ion, they are re|&s;olved not to wait any longer. And to &s;how they were in good earne&s;t, about eight Days after there came Letters from the Grand Inqui&s;itor, expre&s;ly requiring that I &s;hould be put into the Inqui&s;ition, unle&s;s I would embrace the Chri&s;tian Religion. Whether the&s;e Letters were real or &s;uppo|&s;ititious I know not, but this is certain, that the Inqui&s;itors &s;how'd me &s;uch Letters, and withal told me, <HI>That if I did not change my Religion within Ten Days, they were ob|liged to impri&s;on me.</HI> The Je&s;uits were pre|&s;ent, when the&s;e things were done, who having con&s;ulted with the Inqui&s;itors, they both agreed to allow me Fifteen Days
<PB N="23" REF="46">
wherein to make a publick profe&s;&s;ion of their Religion. The rea&s;on of granting me this further time, was this, becau&s;e the Day on which they &s;poke to me was the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and the 15th of that Month being, according to them, the Day of the A&s;&s;umption of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, they had a great mind that I &s;hould publickly declare my Conver&s;ion, and be baptized on that Solemn Fe&s;tival. All the&s;e Propo&s;als I was forc'd to &s;ubmit unto, and dur&s;t not refu&s;e them in my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances: Where|upon they, conceiving good hopes of me, began anew to explain to me the My&s;teries of their Religion, which they did by &s;imili|tudes; Thus, for Example, they illu&s;trated to me the My&s;tery of the Trinity, by the &s;imilitude of a piece of Cloth which is thrice folded, which, notwith&s;tanding the three folds, is one and the &s;ame Cloth. They would never allow me to read the Bible, but they furni&s;h'd me with abundance of Books about the Miracles pretended to be wrought by &s;ome of their Saints, in con|firmation of their peculiar Opinions. For the fir&s;t four or five Days, of the Fifteen which were allotted me, I heard, with great appearance of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, all the demon|&s;trations they pretended to give for their Doctrines, and when they an&s;wered my
<PB N="24" REF="47">
Arguments with Philo&s;ophical di&s;tinctions, and u&s;ed a multitude of hard words, which were to me unintelligible, I granted all that they &s;aid, and confe&s;&s;ed they had almo&s;t made me a Convert. For when I &s;aid that I could not under&s;tand tho&s;e An&s;wers, or Philo&s;ophical Arguments; This Father <HI>De Rode</HI> began to &s;ay to me, My dear, &s;ince you cannot under&s;tand what this Reverend Father &s;ays, I will explain it to you in your own <HI>Japanois</HI> Language; and &s;o in&s;tead of explaining it to me, he &s;aid, <HI>My dear Son, You &s;ee that the Fa|thers Inqui&s;itors, have a great mind to put you into the Inqui&s;ition, becau&s;e you won't confe&s;s your &s;elf a Convert; therefore it would be better for you to &s;ay that you under&s;tand what they &s;ay, than to be any longer ob&s;tinate; their Arguments are very well grounded and rea&s;onable, but you cannot conceive the &s;trength of them; therefore let me de&s;ire you to &s;ay publickly, that you are now per&s;waded of the goodne&s;s of their Arguments, and that you don't require any more.</HI> So I was obliged to &s;peak in Latin, and &s;ay, <HI>Now I under|&s;tand very well, Let us come to another Ar|ticle.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;till I tru&s;ted, under God, to my heels, hoping by &s;ome means or other to get out of their Hands, and to run away in &s;uch
<PB N="25" REF="48">
a Road that they &s;hould not be able to find me out again. After Ten Days of the Fifteen were expired, I had &s;old all that I had, and then I attempted to get out of the City, but I found that the Centinel, who watched at the Gate to which I came, was expre&s;ly forbidden to &s;uffer me to go out; &s;uch care was taken by the Inqui&s;itors to prevent my E&s;cape. However I did not de&s;pair, but being returned to my Lodging, I put off my <HI>Japan</HI> Clothes, which I had hitherto wore, and clad my &s;elf after the Mode of the Country; and then I at|tempted to pa&s;s out by another Gate: But I was &s;o much taken notice of by all the People that were in the City, that the Soldier who &s;tood Centinel at that Gate, knew me under the di&s;gui&s;e of my Clothes, and &s;topp'd me. This &s;econd di&s;appoint|ment frighted me not a little, but having recollected my Spirits, I con&s;idered that Money rules the World, and prevails over the generallity of Men, and therefore I offered the Soldier a Pi&s;tol if he would &s;uffer me to go out, which he accepted of, and &s;o let me go, hoping it could never be di&s;covered that he was the Man that did it. Thus God delivered me out of the Hands of the Je&s;uits and Inqui&s;itors, from whom I could expect no Mercy, if I had not in
<PB N="26" REF="49">
Hypocri&s;ie profe&s;&s;ed <HI>their Religion, which I could never heartily believe.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus made my e&s;cape out of <HI>Avignon,</HI> I travelled along the River <HI>Rhone</HI> with all the &s;peed I could, as far as <HI>Lyons,</HI> from <HI>Lyons</HI> I went to <HI>Salines,</HI> from <HI>Salines</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;ac,</HI> and at la&s;t from <HI>Bri&s;ac</HI> I tra|velled by the &s;ide of the <HI>Rhone,</HI> as far as <HI>An|dernach,</HI> where the Soldiers of the Elector of <HI>Colen</HI> &s;eized me by force, according to the Orders they had received from the E|lector, to Pre&s;s all Pa&s;&s;engers that came that way, to fill up the New Regiments he was Rai&s;ing. There were then three Com|panies in <HI>Andernach,</HI> three in <HI>Lintz,</HI> and &s;ix in <HI>Bonn,</HI> whether all the other Companies re&s;orted, being the place appointed for their Rendezvous; And when they were all come together, my Captain, thinking to gratifie the Colonel's Curio&s;ity, acquainted him with what I had told him, that I was a Native of the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> belonging to Emperor of <HI>Japan,</HI> and by Religion a <HI>Pa|gan</HI>; that I had travelled from this far di&s;tant Country to &s;atisfie my Curio&s;ity of &s;eeing <HI>Europe,</HI> having heard &s;trange things about it: But the Colonel who was a <HI>Savoy|ard,</HI> and call'd <HI>le Chevalier</HI> St. <HI>Maurice,</HI> be|ing a Bigot of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, thought it a damnable thing to retain a <HI>Pagan</HI> in the
<PB N="27" REF="50">
Service of the Elector; who being inform|ed about me, commanded me to be car|ried to &s;ome Je&s;uits, that they might en|deavour to Convert me. Whereupon I was obliged to go with the Colonel and &s;ome other Officers to the Je&s;uits, with whom I was to di&s;pute about Religion; tho' I knew very well by my former ex|perience, that they are not able by &s;trength of Argument to convince any Man, and much le&s;s, a <HI>Jew,</HI> a <HI>Turk,</HI> or a <HI>Heathen.</HI> And now, being well acquainted with their Opinions before hand, and the &s;everal Eva|&s;ions and Di&s;tinctions they made u&s;e of to defend them, I was the better prepared to enter the Li&s;ts with the Je&s;uits, again&s;t whom I endeavoured to demon&s;trate; that there were greater Ab&s;urdities in their Religion, than they could &s;how in mine; which I did with &s;o much readine&s;s and briskne&s;s, and &s;uch a fair appearance of Rea&s;on, that the Colonel cried out, like one a&s;toni&s;hed, It was not I that &s;poke, but &s;ome Devil that &s;poke within me. At la&s;t one of the Je&s;uits took me a&s;ide to a private place, and told me, that I was in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable condition, if I &s;hould continue in the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion, but if I would declare my &s;elf a Convert to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Faith, he was able to obtain great
<PB N="28" REF="51">
things for me from the Prince Elector; But I told him he &s;hould fir&s;t convince me of the Truth of his Religion, before he made me any &s;uch Promi&s;es; which he not being able to do I &s;lighted his offer, and con|tinued &s;till in my own Religion. Where|upon the Colonel was &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t me, that he threatned to throw me into Pri&s;on, and feed me with Bread and Wa|ter, until &s;uch time as I &s;hould declare my &s;elf a Convert. But my Captain, who was much the hone&s;ter Man of the two, ha|ving &s;eized me by force, would not &s;uffer any hurt to be done me; and therefore prayed the Colonel to permit me to go off, and to grant me a Pa&s;s, for traveling whe|ther&s;oever I would; which was pre&s;ently done. After I got out of <HI>Bonn,</HI> I con|tinued my Journey till I came to <HI>Colen,</HI> and there the Centinel who kept the Gate &s;eized me again, and carried me before the Captain of the main Guard, to whom I &s;howed my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion out of <HI>Bonn,</HI> upon the account of my Religion; but he told me, <HI>If others be Fools, I am not, though you are a</HI> Pagan, <HI>you may &s;erve in the Army as well as the be&s;t</HI> Chri&s;tian, and &s;o I was ob|liged to Li&s;t my &s;elf a Soldier in that Re|giment. The Colonel who&s;e Name was <HI>Buchwald,</HI> and the Major who was my
<PB N="29" REF="52">
Captain, and who&s;e Name was <HI>Warm&s;|dorff,</HI> were both <HI>Lutherans:</HI> The Lieuten|ant Colonel, who&s;e Name was <HI>Vanduil,</HI> was a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> and many of the Officers in the Regiment were <HI>Calvini&s;ts,</HI> and all of them belonged to the Prince of <HI>Mechlenburg,</HI> but the Regiment was hir'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> for &s;ome Years.</P>
<P>The Colonel and my Captain &s;ent for &s;ome <HI>Lutheran</HI> Mini&s;ters, whereof one was at <HI>Colen,</HI> another at a Village about an Hour di&s;tant, and two more who &s;erved in the <HI>Brandenburg</HI> Regiments. All the&s;e four came and di&s;puted with me about Religi|on for a whole Day; but their Con&s;ub|&s;tantiation offended me as much as the <HI>Roman</HI> Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.</P>
<P>For it is liable to many of the &s;ame ab|&s;urdities with the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Doctrine, about the Euchari&s;t; Fir&s;t, becau&s;e it denies the certainty of our Sen&s;es in the proper ob|jects, and con&s;equently de&s;troys their great Evidence of the Chri&s;tian Religion, from the Miracles wrought in confirmation of it, which depends upon the Te&s;timony of their Sen&s;es, who were Eye-witne&s;&s;es of them. Secondly, The <HI>Lutheran</HI> Doctrine, as well as the <HI>Romi&s;h,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, that the Body of Chri&s;t which is now Glorious and Immor|tal in Heaven, is Corporally pre&s;ent in the
<PB N="30" REF="53">
Euchari&s;t, and at the &s;ame time in all tho&s;e places where this Sacrament is celebrated, which appeared to me impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e Ab&s;urdities, which are common to them both, the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Do|ctrine is encumbred with &s;everal that are peculiar to it: For fir&s;t they &s;ay, that the&s;e Words, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> are to be under&s;tood literally, and that the Sub&s;tance of the Bread is really pre&s;ent; &s;o that ac|cording to their Interpretation the meaning of the Words is, This Sub&s;tance of the Bread is really the Fle&s;h of Chri&s;t, which is a contradiction <HI>in terminis</HI>; for it is plain|ly impo&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ame Sub&s;tance &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, be both Bread and Fle&s;h. Secondly, They affirm that the Bread in the Euchari&s;t is the Sacrament and Sign of Chri&s;t's Body, and at the &s;ame time that it is the real Body; whereas it is im|po&s;&s;ible that the &s;ame thing &s;hould be both the Sign and the Thing &s;ignified, or that any thing &s;hould be a &s;ign of it &s;elf. Thirdly, They maintain that the Body of Chri&s;t is alive in the Euchari&s;t (for they deny the Popi&s;h Sacrifice of the Ma&s;s, wherein the Body is &s;lain and offered up) which being united to the Divinity, is certainly the object of Adoration, and yet they deny that it is to be wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="54">The&s;e and &s;everal other Arguments I urged again&s;t the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> whereby they perceived that they were not likely to con|vince me of the Truth of their Doctrine about the Euchari&s;t: Whereupon the Mi|ni&s;ter who lived at the Village near <HI>Colen,</HI> took me home with him, and kept me there for Fifteen Days, and thither the Cap|tain came al&s;o, and both of them joined together in making me many large Pro|mi&s;es to entice me to declare for their Re|ligion; but I continued inflexible, and could not be prevailed upon by any &s;uch Motives. After this the Lieutenant Colonel, who was a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick, carried me to the Ca|puchins, and from them to the Je&s;uits; but all the means they could u&s;e with me proved ineffectual. At la&s;t the Officers that were <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> carried me to a Mi|ni&s;ter of their Church, who dealt &s;o ef|fectually with me, that he almo&s;t convinc'd me of the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion, becau&s;e he removed tho&s;e &s;tumbling blocks which were laid in the way by the Papi&s;ts and <HI>Lutherans</HI>: But when he propo&s;ed to me the Doctrine of <HI>Ab&s;olute Pre|de&s;tination,</HI> and endeavoured to prove it from Scripture, I was &s;o &s;hock'd by the apparent ab&s;urdity of it, that I be|gun to doubt of all tho&s;e things he had
<PB N="32" REF="55">
convinced me of before: Whereupon I told him, if ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination was nece&s;&s;ary to be believed, then it was a &s;ign of my Reprobation, that I could not be per|&s;waded to believe it. Be&s;ides I added fur|ther, That, &s;uppo&s;ing ab&s;olute Prede&s;tina|tion I &s;hould never be condemned for my Infidelity, but becau&s;e I was reprobated by an Ab&s;olute and Eternal Decree of God. And La&s;tly, I in&s;i&s;ted upon this Argument, That I could not be per&s;waded to believe in Chri&s;t, unle&s;s I were certain that Chri&s;t died for me; but, &s;uppo&s;ing ab&s;olute Pre|de&s;tination, I could never be certain of this, becau&s;e Chri&s;t died only for tho&s;e who were to be &s;aved by an ab&s;olute Decree, and it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to know whether I was one of that number or no. The&s;e, and &s;uch-like arguments, I propo&s;ed to him, but he, to excu&s;e him&s;elf for not an&s;wering them, pretended that I was ob&s;tinate and would not be convinced by Rea&s;on: And thus, after all the attempts that had been made to convert me to Chri&s;tianity, I con|tinued &s;till firm in my old Religion. In the mean time our Regiment marched from <HI>Colen</HI> to <HI>Boi&s;leduc</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> where &s;ome <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> Mini&s;ters came to &s;ee me, rather out of curio&s;ity, than any de&s;ign of con|verting me, whom I oppo&s;ed with the ar|gument
<PB N="33" REF="56">
again&s;t Prede&s;tination which I la&s;t mentioned, but could never meet with any &s;atisfactory An&s;wer to it. From the <HI>Bo&s;ch</HI> we marched to <HI>Slu&s;e</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where we &s;tay'd for the &s;pace of Three Months and a half, during which time, the mo&s;t generous and candid Brigadier <HI>Lauder,</HI> who was then Governor of <HI>Slu&s;e,</HI> invited to his Hou&s;e a Mini&s;ter of the <HI>French</HI> Church, called <HI>D' Amalvy.</HI> This <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter who had a good Opinion of him|&s;elf, for a very learned Man, challenged me to Di&s;pute with him about Religion, and time and place were agreed upon. When the Day came, there appeared a great mul|titude of learned Men, who came to hear us: And in the pre&s;ence of them all <HI>D' Amalvy</HI> made me this offer; That if I could &s;how greater Evidence for my Religion than he could &s;how for his, he was ready to re|nounce his own Religion and embrace mine; and in return for this frank offer, I promi&s;ed him to do the &s;ame thing, if he could give me clearer demon&s;trations for the truth of his Religion, than I could for mine. Ha|ving thus &s;ettled the Preliminaries, I was fir&s;t to give an account of the God we adored, and our manner of wor&s;hipping him, which I did as well as I could <HI>Ex|tempore</HI>; But when I told him, that we
<PB N="34" REF="57">
are commanded by our God to offer up Infants in Sacrifice to him, he &s;topp'd me, and ask'd, Does not this &s;avour of Cruelty in your God, that he will have Men Sa|crific'd to him; To which I an&s;wer'd, that it was indeed mo&s;t cruel to require &s;uch Human Sacrifices; but from hence I took occa&s;ion to retort the argument upon him, by &s;hewing that his God was yet more cruel, according to his Opinion of him, For if it be cruel to deprive Men of this Temporal Life, tho' by this means they are admitted to Eternal Life; certainly it is infinitely more cruel to create Men on purpo&s;e to make them Eternally mi&s;erable, and to condemn them to this Mi&s;ery before they are Born, without any re&s;pect to the Good or Evil they &s;hall do, and &s;o to Sacrifice them to the Devil. To this Retortion he could not an&s;wer, and &s;o I proceeded fur|ther to inform him, that our God did ap|pear to us in the &s;hape of an Elephant, an Oxe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that under the&s;e &s;hapes we wor&s;hipp'd him: Again&s;t this Apparition of God under &s;uch Figures, he objected, That it was impo&s;&s;ible that God who was Omnipotent, Infinite, Immen&s;e, Incompre|hen&s;ible and Eternal, could be included in the Body of &s;uch a Bea&s;t. To which I an&s;wer'd, That if it is impo&s;&s;ible for God
<PB N="35" REF="58">
to be included in the Body of &s;uch a Bea&s;t, he was bound to maintain the like ab&s;ur|dity by the Principles of his own Religion; For, &s;aid I, you believe that the Holy Gho&s;t, who is God Infinite, Immen&s;e, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did appear under the &s;hape of a Dove, which is much le&s;s than either an Elephant or an Oxe. To this he made no reply, and tho' there were many pre&s;ent who would have an&s;wer'd this and other Arguments, yet he commanded them all to be &s;ilent, and would &s;uffer no body to &s;peak but him|&s;elf. In fine he exhorted me very much to the practice of Chri&s;tian Humility and Meekne&s;s, as if he intended to re&s;erve to him&s;elf alone the <HI>Priviledge of Pride and Arrogance,</HI> which I could plainly di&s;cern, by his Words and Actions, to be very predo|minant in his Temper. Thus this Con|ference ended, without producing any good effect upon me, and if by God's Provi|dence I had not met with a better Guide to direct me in the Cour&s;e I &s;hould Steer to arrive at a &s;afe Harbour in this dangerous Sea of Controver&s;ies, I mu&s;t have &s;plit up|on the Rocks and Shelves of the ab&s;urd O|pinions I met with among &s;ome &s;ort of Chri&s;tians, and adhear'd more ob&s;tinately than ever to the Idoltry in which I was educated. For I could never bring my
<PB N="36" REF="59">
Mind to believe &s;uch a Scheme of the Chri&s;tian Religion, as was propo&s;ed, but not <HI>demon&s;trated by him</HI>; Such a Sy&s;tem of Religion could never find en|tertainment with me, which places <HI>Cer|berus</HI> in the very Thre&s;hold, I mean, which impo&s;es as a nece&s;&s;ary Article of Faith, the horrible decree of ab&s;olute Reprobation, for this Doctrine gives a very odious and fright|ful Idea of a mo&s;t Good and Gracious God, by repre&s;enting him as Cruel and Tyrani|cal to his poor Creatures, as one that de|&s;igns and delights in their Eternal Ruine; it perfectly overturns all Religion, by de|&s;troying the u&s;e of all Laws, and their Re|wards and Puni&s;hments, to tho&s;e that are f etter'd with the Adamantine Chains of this fatal Decree; who according to the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> are the greate&s;t part of Man|kind. But while I was in this uncertain and dangerous Condition, it plea&s;ed God, who is infinitely Wi&s;e and Good, and will not &s;uffer that Religion which he has planted and maintain'd by his own Al|mighty Power, to be check'd in its progre&s;s by the Ignorance or Mi&s;take of his Mini|&s;ters: I &s;ay, it plea&s;ed this good God to provide for me &s;uch a Judicious and Ho|ne&s;t Guide, as was very &s;ucce&s;sful in all things relating to my Conver&s;ion, who

<P>But before I proceed to the&s;e Arguments, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the various Opinions of learned Men concerning the means of attaining the Knowledge of God: Some think that the notion of God is im|printed on the Hearts of all Men by na|ture; others deny that there is any &s;uch Idea of a God in the Minds of Men by nature: Some think that the Knowledge of God is convey'd to us by Revelation, or deriv'd by Tradition from the fir&s;t Man, who was immediately created by God.

If it be from it &s;elf, then it is uncreated, independent and eternal, and con&s;equently God: If from another, &s;eeing all &s;econd Cau&s;es are produced by &s;ome other which give them being, (as we derive our original from our Fathers, and they from their Fathers, and &s;o upwards) then either the&s;e &s;econd Cau&s;es mu&s;t produce one another <HI>in infi|nitum,</HI> without any beginning; or the effect mu&s;t &s;ometimes produce a prior Cau&s;e, and &s;o they mu&s;t produce one ano|ther in a Circle, or we mu&s;t acknowledge &s;ome fir&s;t Cau&s;e, by which all other things are produced, which is God.</P>
<P>Now there cannot be an infinite &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of Cau&s;es producing one another from all Eternity: For every Cau&s;e that pro|duces a new thing out of nothing, mu&s;t have &s;ome beginning of its operation, which mu&s;t be perfected in a limited time, and therefore there can be no &s;uch pro|duction of any thing from all Eternity, but every thing mu&s;t be produced in a cer|tain determinate time, which is plainly in|con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of Eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="74">And neither can there be any &s;uch cir|cular production of Cau&s;es, whereby the la&s;t effect is the efficient of the fir&s;t Cau&s;e, for then the &s;ame thing would be the Cau&s;e of its Cau&s;e, it would be Prior and Po&s;terior to its Cau&s;e, and to it &s;elf, which is plainly impo&s;&s;ible, and therefore we mu&s;t conclude, that there is a fir&s;t Cau&s;e which is uncreated, and the Creator of all things el&s;e.</P>

<P>I am &s;ure that there is &s;omething now in the World, for I am con&s;cious to my &s;elf, that I think, I perceive, I doubt; which Actions cannot proceed from nothing, and therefore I am certain, that there is a thinking Being. And from hence the&s;e two things will undeniably follow, 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> That there was &s;omething from all Eternity, for either there was always &s;omething, and &s;o there was an eternal Being, or there was a time when there was nothing, and then nothing could ever have been; for there is no Principle more certain than this, that nothing can produce nothing; but every thing that has a Being, mu&s;t be produc'd by &s;omething; and therefore if there was a time when there was nothing, nothing could ever have been produced.
<PB N="52" REF="75">
2<HI>dly,</HI> Since 'tis certain that there is now in the World a thinking Being, which knows and under&s;tands; from hence it will no le&s;s evidently follow, that there was a Knowing, Under&s;tanding Being from all Eternity; for it is no le&s;s impo&s;|&s;ible for a Being devoid of Knowledge to produce a knowing Being, than for no|thing to produce &s;omething; and if there was a time when there was no &s;uch know|ing Being, it could never have begun to be, becau&s;e there was no cau&s;e to produce it; and therefore &s;uch a knowing Being mu&s;t be from Eternity. After the &s;ame manner we may deduce all the perfecti|ons of God, for we find there is Power, Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s in the World; all which mu&s;t be deriv'd from the &s;ame eter|nal Source: For if there had been a time when the&s;e things were not, they could never have begun to be, there being then no cau&s;e to produce them; and there|fore this eternal Being mu&s;t be al&s;o mo&s;t Knowing, Powerful, Wi&s;e and Good, and be the fir&s;t cau&s;e and original of all the&s;e Perfections we find in the World; for no|thing can ever give to another any Per|fection that it hath not in it &s;elf, and there|fore the fir&s;t eternal Cau&s;e of all things mu&s;t contain in it all the Perfections that can ever after exi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="76">Having thus e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Exi&s;tence of a God, I &s;hall next proceed to prove, that he is the Ruler of the World, who di|rects and governs all things by his wi&s;e Pro|vidence: Which will appear by con&s;ider|ing, 1. That all things in nature do act for certain ends, which they attain by u&s;ing proper means fitted to tho&s;e ends that are de&s;ign'd; but to de&s;ign and pur&s;ue an end, and make choice of fit means for compa&s;&s;ing that end, are &s;uch actions as re|quire Rea&s;on, Wi&s;dom, and Fore&s;ight, which no inanimate Creature is capable of; and therefore all inanimate Creatures mu&s;t be directed and guided by &s;ome wi&s;e Superintendent, in pur&s;uing their &s;everal ends by proper means, which them&s;elves know nothing of. 2. We &s;ee that all things in nature are &s;ubordinate to one another, and made &s;ub&s;ervient to &s;everal excellent u&s;es and purpo&s;es, which mu&s;t be the contrivance of a wi&s;e Governour that ruleth over all.</P>
<P>Thus the Plants and Herbs &s;erve for food to Animals, and both Plants and Animals are u&s;eful for many purpo&s;es to Man, as for Food and Phy&s;ick, and &s;eve|ral other nece&s;&s;ary ends in humane Life: Man him&s;elf is wonderfully made, all the parts of his Body being wi&s;ely adapted to perform their &s;everal Functions, and mu|tually
<PB N="54" REF="77">
&s;ub&s;ervient to one another, and to the good of the whole, as might be largely prov'd by particular in&s;tances, if it were nece&s;&s;ary. We cannot open our Eyes but we meet with many Arguments of a wi&s;e over-ruling Providence; for the Air &s;erves us to breath in, and is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to our Life, that it cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t many Minutes without it. The Earth &s;upplies us with Corn for food, and Wood for firing; it &s;upports or hou&s;es, and furni&s;hes the ma|terials for buildings of them: The Sea &s;erves to tran&s;port our Ships and Commo|dities to the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of the Earth, and to bring home into our Harbours the Products of all other Countries. The Sun does not &s;hine for him&s;elf, but appears to be made on purpo&s;e to give Light to them that live upon the Earth, and it is placed at &s;uch a convenient di|&s;tance, and moves in &s;uch a con&s;tant uni|form cour&s;e, as is nece&s;&s;ary to refre&s;h all things on Earth with its heat, and to ri|pen all the Fruits of the Ground. By which, and many thou&s;and other In&s;tances wherein the Creatures are admirably fitted for u&s;eful and excellent purpo&s;es, it plainly appears, that the Works of Nature cannot po&s;&s;ibly be the Effects of blind Chance and Nece&s;&s;ity, but mu&s;t be the contrivance of an All-wi&s;e Creator and Governour. 3. To
<PB N="55" REF="78">
the&s;e Arguments we might add for a far|ther confirmation of this Truth, 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> The Univer&s;al con&s;ent of all Nations, which generally agree, that there is one &s;upreme God, who made and governs the World. 2<HI>dly,</HI> The Natural Power of Con&s;cience, which reproves and torments a Man for the heinous Crimes he has committed, tho' the Per&s;on be above the fear of human Puni&s;h|ment, or the Crime be committed &s;o &s;ecret|ly, as to e&s;cape all natural means of di&s;co|very; in which Ca&s;es Con&s;cience by its Sentence does, as it were, bind a Man over to the Judgment of a &s;uperiour invi&s;ible Judge. But I &s;hall conclude all with this Reflexion: That from what has been &s;aid it appears, that tho' Mankind had not any innate Notion of a God, yet they are en|dow'd with &s;uch a rational Faculty, by which they can deduce the exi&s;tence of a God, from &s;uch Principles as are univer|&s;ally known and acknowledg'd by the Light of Nature: And this they can do without the help of Revelation, which mu&s;t al|ways pre&s;uppo&s;e the being of a God who makes that Revelation.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the Attributes of GOD in general.</HEAD>
<P>ALtho' we conceive the Divine E&s;&s;ence in it &s;elf to be one and the &s;ame, which con&s;i&s;ts in all po&s;&s;ible perfection; yet the Attributes of God may be di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd and call'd by peculiar Names, with re&s;pect to the different Objects upon which they are exercis'd, and the different Ope|rations that are exerted upon them; not that there is any real diver&s;ity in God him|&s;elf, but only in our Conceptions of him; for &s;uch is the weakne&s;s of our Under|&s;tanding, that we cannot in one Thought comprehend all the Divine Perfections, but are forc'd to repre&s;ent them to our Minds &s;everally, as exerting them&s;elves up|on different Objects; and &s;o there is no difference in the Attributes them&s;elves, but only in our manner of conceiving, with re&s;pect to their different Operations.</P>
<P>But before we proceed to a particular enumeration of the Divine Attributes, we mu&s;t premi&s;e, that the&s;e Attributes are not to be confounded with the peculiar Ef|fects proceeding from them, but the&s;e two are to be di&s;tinctly con&s;ider'd and explain'd.
<PB N="57" REF="80">
Thus Ju&s;tice is to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from Puni&s;hment, and Goodne&s;s from Benefi|cence, as Cau&s;es are commonly di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd from their proper Effects.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, we may divide the Divine Attributes into two &s;orts: For ther God is con&s;ider'd &s;imply as a Being, and &s;o Spirituality and Eternity are attri|buted to him; or as a living Being, and &s;o Under&s;tanding and Will are a&s;crib'd to him. The Attributes of God that are in the Will, may be con&s;ider'd two ways, ei|ther after the manner of Affections, &s;uch as we feel in our &s;elves, and &s;o Love, Ha|tred, Anger, De&s;ire, Joy, and Sorrow, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are attributed to God; or after the man|ner of Moral Vertues, as Ju&s;tice, Good|ne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering, Severity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to which we may add, as that which re&s;ults from all his other Attributes, his Glory and Happine&s;s.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="58" REF="81">
<HEAD>SECT. III. Of the Divine Attributes in particular.</HEAD>
<P>OF the Attributes which belong to to God as he is &s;imply a Being, we &s;hall reckon in the fir&s;t place Unity; for God is properly and numerically one, as being undivided in him&s;elf, and divided from all other things; and becau&s;e the Divine Nature cannot be multiplied into different Gods, as the Human Nature is into &s;everal Men, therefore there is one only true God, and there is no other God be&s;ides him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Attribute which belongs to God as he is &s;imply a Being, is Spirituali|ty; for God is a Spirit, <HI>i. e.</HI> a mo&s;t pure and immaterial Being, devoid of all bulk, who&s;e mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Act is Cogitation; and he is not only incorporeal, but the mo&s;t pure and &s;imple of all Spirits.</P>
<P>The third Attribute of this &s;ort belong|ing to God, is Eternity, which is nothing el&s;e but a Duration that has neither be|ginning nor end. But when we &s;ay that God is eternal, both <HI>a parte ante,</HI> and <HI>a parte po&s;t,</HI> we include under this Notion his Immutability, and affirm, that God
<PB N="59" REF="82">
is free from all variation and change.</P>
<P>The fourth Attribute of God is his Im|men&s;ity, whereby he filleth all places: And therefore when we &s;ay that God is immen&s;e, we affirm that no place can con|tain him, and that he is every-where pre|&s;ent in all imaginable &s;paces. And &s;o much may &s;uffice for the Explication of the fir&s;t &s;ort of Attributes.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort of Attributes are &s;uch as belong to him as he is a living Being: And in &s;peaking to them, we are fir&s;t to con&s;i|der his Life, as being the Foundation of all this kind of Attributes and their Ope|rations, without which he could neither exi&s;t, nor act as an intelligent Being, nor be capable of Happine&s;s, which is contrary to the Idea we have already fram'd of God.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Attribute of this &s;ort is Un|der&s;tanding, which may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd into Knowledge and Wi&s;dom. The Ob|ject of the Divine Knowledge is every thing that is knowable, all things that are, have been, or &s;hall be, all things that are po&s;&s;i|ble and impo&s;&s;ible. When therefore we &s;ay that God is Omni&s;cient, we affirm that God does, 1. Know him&s;elf, and all his own infinite Perfections. 2. That he knows all things that are in him&s;elf, or from him|&s;elf, or without him&s;elf; within him&s;elf,
<PB N="60" REF="83">
as his Decrees; from him&s;elf, as his ex|ternal Actions of Creation, Pre&s;ervation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without him&s;elf, as the Sins of Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom of God is that Perfection in God, whereby he foreknows and di|rects the means which he thinks fit for at|taining a certain End, which is either &s;ub|ordinate, as the Redemption of Mankind, which he accompli&s;h'd by the Incarnation of his only Son, or ultimate, which is the demon&s;tration of his own Glory, to which all other things are made &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>
<P>The third Attribute is the Divine Will, which may be either con&s;ider'd as the Fa|culty, or the Act of willing &s;uch and &s;uch things to be done, for wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and good Ends: Such are all the Decrees of God whereby he re&s;olves within him&s;elf to ac|compli&s;h certain Ends, by &s;uch means as conduce mo&s;t to his own Glory. And the&s;e Decrees are either ab&s;olute, as tho&s;e of the Creation, and &s;ending his own Son into the World; or conditional, as the Decrees of &s;aving Mankind, upon the Con|ditions of Faith and Repentance.</P>
<P>In the Divine Will we may con&s;ider two kinds of Attributes, whereof the fir&s;t is conceiv'd after the manner of the Affe|ctions we feel in our &s;elves; the &s;econd is conceiv'd after the manner of the Moral
<PB N="61" REF="84">
Vertues, which in us do govern the Affe|ctions.</P>
<P>Love in God is an Affection whereby he delights in that which is good, and in communicating him&s;elf unto it, whence ari&s;es Goodne&s;s. This Love includes in it &s;elf, Grace, Mercy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Hatred is that Affection which is oppo|&s;ite to Love, whereby God abhors every thing that is evil.</P>
<P>Anger hath great affinity with Hatred, and in us it is an Affection whereby we keep off any thing that is evil from our &s;elves, but in God it &s;ignifies his purpo&s;e of puni&s;hing Evil-doers.</P>
<P>The Ju&s;tice of God does perfectly agree with his Holine&s;s, and is that Perfection whereby he always wills and does that which is good, holy, ju&s;t, and right, and this is call'd Univer&s;al Ju&s;tice; but his particular Ju&s;tice is that which di&s;tributes to every one what is due, or that whereby he rewards the Good, and puni&s;hes the E|vil, and &s;o it re&s;pects Man as &s;ubject to the Law of Nature.</P>
<P>This Ju&s;tice is temper'd with Mildne&s;s and Long-&s;uffering, which are tho&s;e Per|fections in God that re&s;train his Anger again&s;t Sinners without a great cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The Omnipotence of God is that Per|fection whereby he can do all things that
<PB N="62" REF="85">
do not imply a contradiction, and is &s;uch a Power as nothing can re&s;i&s;t. The Glory of God is the Excellency of the Divine Nature, whereby he infinitely exceeds all the Creatures. The Happine&s;s of God is the re&s;ult of all the Divine Perfections, in which he cannot but take great compla|cency, and &s;o they make him infinitely happy by the contemplation of them.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, we may infer, That &s;ince God is a mo&s;t &s;imple Being, and his Attributes are not really di&s;tingui&s;h'd from one another, his Actions do not pro|ceed from one Attribute alone, but from an harmonious concurrence of all his Attri|butes together.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Of God's End in Creating the World.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Exi&s;tence of a God, and prov'd him to be the Creator and Governor of all things, &s;o far as was nece&s;&s;ary in a matter &s;o clear and evident in it &s;elf, I proceed now to con&s;ider the End which God might pro|po&s;e to him&s;elf in creating the World, which mu&s;t be &s;uch as is &s;utable to his own infinite Perfections: And &s;eeing the Glory of God is the re&s;ult of his mo&s;t excellent Nature, we cannot imagine, that he did propo&s;e to him&s;elf any other End in all his Works, be&s;ides his own Glory. And this &s;eems to me as clear as the Sun at Noon-day. But if all the Creatures were made for the Glory of God, then 'tis cer|tain that every one of them is bound to glorifie God in that Station wherein it was created; and &s;o we &s;ay, that the Heavens declare the Glory of God, becau&s;e by them we come to the knowledge of God: But Man being the mo&s;t perfect of all the vi&s;i|ble Creatures, and endow'd with the mo&s;t excellent Faculties, ought &s;o much the more to &s;hew forth the Glory of God
<PB N="64" REF="87">
above all the other Creatures, by how much he is more capable and adapted by Nature to that end. And indeed the in|animate Creatures can only &s;ilently com|mend their Maker, but it is the Duty of Man to make their Prai&s;es vocal, and to declare the infinite Power, Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s of God, which plainly appear in the Works of the Creation. And this is the Great End for which his Faculties were given him by God; for therefore has he Eyes to &s;ee, and an Under&s;tanding to perceive and apprehend the wonderful Works; therefore has he a Tongue given him to publi&s;h the Prai&s;e that's due to his mo&s;t excellent and bountiful Creator. Whether therefore we con&s;ider the End for which Man was created, or the many and great Benefits he has receiv'd from God, as the creating him of &s;uch an excellent Na|ture, his Pre&s;ervation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he cannot but be &s;en&s;ible that he is &s;trictly oblig'd to wor&s;hip and &s;erve him in &s;ome way or other: For all Men will own, that we ought not only to remember our Benefa|ctors, but to return them hearty Thanks &s;uitable to the greatne&s;s of the Benefits we have receiv'd.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V. Of the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Divine Revelation.</HEAD>
<P>AND, 1. Since the Divine Favours are &s;o great and &s;o valuable, 'tis cer|tain that no Man can render him any Wor|&s;hip and Service that is equivalent to them. 2. Since God is a mo&s;t perfect and &s;imple Being, he will be wor&s;hipp'd in a perfect and &s;imple manner; but 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that Mankind &s;hould now in its pre&s;ent State of Corruption, unanimou&s;ly agree in the true Way of wor&s;hipping God, if it were left to their Invention; for be&s;ides that the Rea&s;on of Men is infinitely va|rious, according to their different Tempers, Capacities, Prejudices of Education, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Human Nature is &s;o much corrupted, and does daily &s;o far degenerate more and more, as we find by &s;ad Experience, that they can neither di&s;cern the right manner of wor&s;hipping God, nor perform him pure and acceptable Service.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;uppo&s;ing that Mankind could agree in a certain Form of Divine Service, and pre&s;erve it &s;ound and entire, yet &s;till this Doubt would always remain in their Minds, Whether &s;uch a Wor&s;hip were ac|ceptable
<PB N="66" REF="89">
to God or no? For whether we offer to him Gifts or Sacrifices, they all belong to him as Lord of the whole Crea|tion; nay, if we &s;hould &s;acrifice to him our Soul and Body, we give him nothing but what we have receiv'd of his free Bounty; and therefore we can never be certain that we are acceptable to him by any thing we can do, or offering we can make. And this is what <HI>Socrates</HI> &s;aid of old, a little before his Death: <HI>I have la|bour'd all my Life-time, and done what I could to render my &s;elf acceptable to God, and yet I &s;till doubt whether I have pleas'd him:</HI> As <HI>Regis</HI> relates in his <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e of Philo&s;ophy.</HI> From whence we may con|clude, that Mankind by Nature is &s;o much mi&s;taken in their Notions of God, and has &s;o far err'd from the right way of wor&s;hip|ping him, being wholly addicted to &s;en&s;i|ble Things and Plea&s;ures, that a Revela|tion from God was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to teach him the true Knowledge of God and of his Will, particularly as to the man|ner of performing him acceptable Service; and therefore our infinitely-good and mer|ciful God, taking pity of the natural Blind|ne&s;s of Mankind, was plea&s;ed of his infi|nite Goodne&s;s to reveal his Will to them, and the particular manner wherein he will be wor&s;hipt. And this Revelation being
<PB N="67" REF="90">
once made, all Men to whom it is &s;uffi|ciently propos'd, are bound, as they hope for Salvation, and would avoid eternal Torment, to keep the Commands of God, and ob&s;erve that Form of Divine Wor&s;hip which he him&s;elf has pre&s;crib'd: Which Ob&s;ervation of Divine Wor&s;hip is that which is commonly call'd Religion.</P>
<P>But before we proceed to treat of Re|ligion, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that becau&s;e Men are &s;tiff-necked, and &s;low to believe Divine Truth, therefore le&s;t any &s;hould call in que&s;tion the Revelation that comes from God, and take him for an Im|po&s;tor who deliver'd it, 'twas nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be confirm'd by certain Evidence, the better to per&s;uade Men to believe that it came from God; and &s;o we find that the Chri&s;tian Religion was confirm'd by Miracles, and &s;upernatural Signs at the time of its fir&s;t publication: And becau&s;e cun|ning and ingenious Men may do many things by their extraordinary Art and Skill, which may &s;eem to us miraculous when they really are not, we &s;hall hereafter &s;hew how any Man may di&s;cern between a true Miracle, and that which is fal&s;ly pretended to be one.

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Of Religion in general.</HEAD>
<P>SInce God is a mo&s;t perfect Being, 'tis certain that he cannot contradict him|&s;elf, and e&s;tabli&s;h two contrary Religions, having different and incon&s;i&s;tent Objects of Wor&s;hip; and therefore when we &s;ee &s;o many different Religions in the World, every one of which is contrary to ano|ther, and condemns another, we mu&s;t conclude that only one of the&s;e Religions is true, and of Divine Authority, and that the re&s;t are Human Inventions, Frauds, and Forgeries: It concerns us therefore to en|quire after the Means whereby we may di|&s;tingui&s;h the true Religion from tho&s;e that are fal&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Means may be con&s;ider'd two ways, either with re&s;pect to the Evidence, or to the Object. We have already ob&s;erv'd, that the great Evidence of the true Reli|gion, is the Miracles that are wrought for the confirmation of it; but that we may be able to di&s;cern true Miracles from tho&s;e that are counterfeit, I &s;hall lay down the three chief Conditions which are requi&s;ite in a true Miracle. The fir&s;t is, That he
<PB N="69" REF="92">
who works a Miracle, &s;hould know before|hand that he is to work it, and have a mind to do it. The &s;econd is, That it be certainly known that the Miracle, or Sign, was wrought, and that the Effect of it be obvious to our Sen&s;es. The third, That the Thing done be &s;uch as tran&s;cends all the Power of natural Cau&s;es; which may be done two ways: The fir&s;t is, when it &s;o far tran&s;cends all the Powers of Nature, that it appears plainly impo&s;&s;ible to be wrought by them, as the rai&s;ing of the Dead to Life again. The &s;econd is, when the thing done is &s;uch as does not exceed the force of natural Cau&s;es, but the man|ner of doing it is plainly &s;upernatural, as the curing of Di&s;ea&s;es by a Word-&s;peaking, without applying any Remedy.</P>
<P>As to the Object of true Religion, it ought to re&s;pect the Glory of God, the Publick Good, and the Private Good of every particular Man. And the&s;e are the Means which I think &s;ufficient for di&s;cern|ing a true Religion from that which is fal&s;e. For, 1. As to Miracles, 'tis certain, that God will not exert his Almighty Power to confirm a Lye, and ju&s;tifie an Im|po&s;tor. 2. As to the Object of Religion, 'tis likewi&s;e certain, that every fal&s;e Reli|gion which is invented by a Deceiver, is attended with &s;ome ab&s;urdity in its Do|ctrine
<PB N="70" REF="93">
or Precepts, and contains in it &s;ome|thing either contrary to the Divine Na|ture, or the Good and Welfare of Man|kind. If therefore we can di&s;cover &s;uch a Religion as has the above-mention'd Evi|dence and Object, we may &s;afely conclude that it is revealed by God; but if it be de|fective in either of the&s;e two, we mu&s;t be|lieve that it is fal&s;e, and ought to be reject|ed by all.</P>

<P>IT would be an endle&s;s as well as u&s;ele&s;s Work, to run over all the &s;everal Reli|gions that are in the World, for choo&s;ing one from among them which is e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon good Principles and &s;ure Founda|tions; and therefore I &s;hall &s;ingle out the Chri&s;tian Religion, as that which &s;eems to me, at the fir&s;t propo&s;al, to be more excel|lent than the re&s;t, and endeavour to prove, That it is founded upon the cleare&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t Evidence, that any rational Man
<PB N="71" REF="94">
can de&s;ire in matters of that nature. And this I hope will give full Satisfaction to the Reader of the following Di&s;cour&s;e, if he be a Chri&s;tian; and I de&s;ire him to judge for him&s;elf in this Ca&s;e, by comparing his own Religion with all the other Re|ligions profe&s;s'd in the World, and he will undoubtedly find it to excel all the re&s;t, for the rea&s;onablene&s;s and certainty of its Doctrines, and the holine&s;s and goodne&s;s of its Laws. But if the Reader be a Jew, a Turk, or Heathen, I hope he will take the pains to compare his own Religion impartially with the Chri&s;tian, and I doubt not he will quickly perceive on which &s;ide the advantage lies, as to the evidence of Principles, and goodne&s;s of Precepts. For 1. The Miracles of Chri&s;t were infinitely more numerous and greater than tho&s;e of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>; and <HI>Mahomet</HI> never pretended to work any Miracles for Confirmation of his Religion, but us'd the Sword only for its propagation: And as to the Pagans, the &s;trange Feats which they pretend to, are either ridiculous and incredible, or the Tricks and Forgeries of their Prie&s;ts, which cannot endure a fair Trial, as will appear more fully hereafter. At pre&s;ent I &s;hall apply my &s;elf to the Con&s;ideration of Chri&s;t's Miracles, and &s;hew that they have all the Characteri&s;ticks of true Miracles,
<PB N="72" REF="95">
and that they were undoubtedly wrought by him for the Confirmation of his Re|ligion, when it was fir&s;t delivered in <HI>Judaea.</HI></P>
<P>And, 1. The Miracles of Chri&s;t have all the three Conditions afore-mention'd which are requi&s;ite in true Miracles: For, 1. Chri&s;t knew before-hand that he was to do his Miracles, and freely cho&s;e to work them in &s;ome places, and not in others, as appears from the Hi&s;tory of his Life, re|corded by the Evangeli&s;ts. 2. He did not work his Miracles in &s;ecret places, or in a corner, but publickly and openly, in the Face of the Sun, before great Multitudes of People&punc; of all &s;orts, not only Friends but Enemies, and the wonderful Effects of them were apparent to the Sen&s;es of all that were pre&s;ent: And therefore that &s;uch Miracles were wrought by him, is own'd not only by Chri&s;tians, but even by the Jews in their <HI>Talmud,</HI> by <HI>Mahomet</HI> in his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and by many Pagan Au|thors, who&s;e Names and Te&s;timonies &s;hall be hereafter mention'd. And La&s;tly, The Miracles of Chri&s;t were &s;uch as tran&s;cend|ed all the Powers of natural Cau&s;es; as to rai&s;e the Dead to Life again, to give Sight to the Blind, Hearing to the Deaf, Health to the Sick, without the u&s;e of any Medi|cines, or natural Means, that are proper
<PB N="73" REF="96">
to cure tho&s;e People; all which Effects therefore mu&s;t needs proceed from a &s;uper|natural Power, and can be a&s;crib'd to God only.</P>
<P>Tho' what has been &s;aid may be thought &s;ufficient, yet to convince all Men more fully of the &s;upernatural force and energy that was con&s;picuous in Chri&s;t's Miracles, I &s;hall add the following Con&s;iderations: 1. That they were in a manner infinite for number, &s;o that they cannot be particu|larly reckon'd up; for he went thro' all the Cities and Villages of <HI>Judaea,</HI> curing all Di&s;ea&s;es, and heal'd all that were po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of the Devil: And the Writers of his Life declare, that he wrought many other Miracles be&s;ides tho&s;e which are mention'd in their Hi&s;tory. 2. That they extended univer&s;ally to all &s;orts of Crea|tures, over which he &s;hew'd an ab&s;olute Dominion, by the miraculous Effects he produc'd; as over Devils, by driving them out of Men that were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with them; over the Winds and Seas, by allaying the Storm and Tempe&s;t at his Command; over the Fi&s;hes and Loaves, by multiplying a few of them to &s;uch a prodigious quantity as was &s;ufficient to feed Five thou&s;and; over the Swine, by &s;uffering the Devils to enter into them, and drive them head-long into the Sea; over the Fig-Tree, by bla&s;t|ing
<PB N="74" REF="97">
it with his Word; over the Water, by changing it into Wine; over all &s;orts of Di&s;ea&s;es, by healing of them; and la&s;tly, over Death it &s;elf, by rai&s;ing the Dead to Life again. 3. The Miracles of Chri&s;t pro|duc'd &s;uch Effects as were not tran&s;ient but permanent: For the Dead being rais'd to Life, continu'd to live; the Blind having receiv'd their Sight, continu'd to &s;ee; the Lepers being cleans'd, continu'd clean: And all the&s;e things were done in the pre|&s;ence of many Beholders, who &s;aw and ob&s;erv'd the wonderful change that was wrought. 4. All the Miracles of Chri&s;t but two, were Miracles of great Mercy and Goodne&s;s as well as Power; as the healing of Di&s;ea&s;es, the rai&s;ing the Dead to Life again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I &s;ay, except two, which were his &s;ending the Devils into the Herd of Swine, and the cur&s;ing of the Fig-Tree: And the&s;e &s;erv'd to &s;hew his ab&s;olute Do|minion over Plants and Animals. 5. All the Miracles of Chri&s;t, even tho&s;e that re|quire the greate&s;t Power and Energy, were wrought by a Word-&s;peaking. After <HI>La|zarus</HI> had lain three Days in the Grave, he did but &s;ay to him, <HI>Come forth</HI>; and immediately he aro&s;e, with all his Grave-Cloaths upon him: He did but take the Ruler's Daughter by the Hand, and &s;ay unto her, <HI>Maid, ari&s;e</HI>; and pre&s;ently her
<PB N="75" REF="98">
Spirit came again, and &s;he aro&s;e &s;traight|way. He had &s;uch a divine commanding Power over all natural Cau&s;es, that he cur'd the mo&s;t de&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;es, even at a di&s;tance, by &s;peaking a few Words: Thus he cur'd the Noble-man's Son, when he was at the point of Death, by &s;aying, <HI>Thy Son liveth</HI>; and the Centurion's Ser|vant, by &s;aying, <HI>As thou ha&s;t believ'd, &s;o be it done unto thee:</HI> Nay, the di&s;ea&s;ed Woman that follow'd him in a Croud was cur'd by touching the Hem of his Garment, becau&s;e &s;he believ'd, when he perceiv'd that Vertue was gone out of him. All the&s;e Miracles he wrought without u&s;ing means; and when he applied &s;ome means, they were &s;uch as were naturally unfit to produce the Effect intended: As when he cur'd the Man born blind, by &s;pitting on the Ground, and making Clay of his Spit|tle, and anointing his Eyes with it, &s;end|ing him to the Pool of <HI>Siloam</HI>; and the performing this Cure by &s;uch unfit means, was no le&s;s an Argument of his Divine Power in working the Miracle, than if he had us'd no means at all. 6. Chri&s;t had not only this Power in him&s;elf of working Miracles, but he di&s;pos'd of that Power to his Apo&s;tles, who wrought many Signs and Wonders in his Name: So St. <HI>Peter</HI> cur'd the lame Man, by commanding him
<PB N="76" REF="99">
in the Name of Je&s;us to ri&s;e up and walk; a Miracle that was notoriou&s;ly known to all that dwelt at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and which the Rulers of the Jews could not deny, tho' they were their malicious Enemies. Nay, the Dead were rai&s;ed by them, <HI>Tabitha</HI> by St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>Eutychus</HI> by St. <HI>Paul</HI>; and Handkerchiefs and Napkins obtain'd the Virtue of doing mighty Cures, by being &s;ent from the Apo&s;tles Hands; and St. <HI>Pe|ter</HI>'s Shadow heal'd all that were afflicted with evil Spirits throughout all <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and all the Cities round about it, as we read in the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI> This was a wonderful demon&s;tration of the Divine Power in Chri&s;t, that he could communi|cate the Gift of Miracles to his Di&s;ciples; as it was of his Divine Pre&s;cience, that he foretold a thing &s;o &s;trange, which requir'd an Almighty Power to accompli&s;h, by a&s;&s;u|ring tho&s;e that believed in him, that they &s;hould out-do the many Miracles he him|&s;elf had wrought; both which were his peculiar Prerogatives, whereby he excell'd the fir&s;t Founders of all the other pretend|ed Religions in the World, who never pretended to the Power of be&s;towing the Gift of Miracles upon their Di&s;ciples, or to foretel the working of them. 7. The Apo&s;tles, after they receiv'd their Commi&s;|&s;ion from Chri&s;t to preach the Go&s;pel to
<PB N="77" REF="100">
all Nations, wrought Miracles not only in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and the Land of <HI>Judaea,</HI> but in <HI>Samaria, Phenice, Cyprus, Antioch, Ephe&s;us,</HI> and many other Cities and Countries thro' which the Apo&s;tles travell'd for planting the Chri&s;tian Faith, in all which places God confirm'd the Word of his Grace, by doing Signs and Wonders by the Apo&s;tles Hands, as we read in the <HI>Acts of the Apo|&s;tles</HI>; and St. <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> round about unto <HI>Illyricum,</HI> the Go&s;pel had been preach'd by him with mighty Signs and Wonders: Nay, &s;o uni|ver&s;ally &s;pread was the Fame of the Apo|&s;tles Doctrine and Miracles, that their Sound went into all the Earth, and their Words unto the Ends of the World; for not only the Jews but Gentiles, the <HI>Romans, Co|rinthians,</HI> and &s;ome of all the mo&s;t famous Countries then known, were converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, by the Preaching and Miracles of the Apo&s;tles, who could all te|&s;tifie, that they &s;aw &s;uch mighty Works done by them, as convinc'd them that their Doctrine was from God: So that this Evi|dence was not only publickly but univer|&s;ally known. 8. This Gift of Miracles was not confin'd to the Days of the Apo|&s;tles, but was continued in the Chri&s;tian Church for the fir&s;t three Centuries, as ap|pears from the Writings of <HI>Irenaeus, Ori|gen,
<PB N="78" REF="101">
Tertullian,</HI> and other Primitive Chri|&s;tians, who relate innumerable In&s;tances of this miraculous Power in the &s;econd and third Ages of the Church, and appeal for the Truth of their Relations to the Hea|thens who liv'd in tho&s;e Times: And of its continuance in the fourth Century, <HI>Eu|&s;ebius, Cyril,</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> are &s;ufficient Wit|ne&s;&s;es; all which are cited in &s;everal late Writers, to whom I refer the Reader. And &s;ome of the Miracles wrought in the&s;e Ages, are not only te&s;tified by Chri&s;tians, but al&s;o by Heathens; for <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> him&s;elf te&s;tified publickly in his Letters to the Senate, the Miracle that was wrought at his Battle with the <HI>Marcomanni,</HI> when the Chri&s;tian Soldiers obtain'd by their Prayers, a refre&s;hing Shower to the <HI>Roman</HI> Army di&s;tre&s;s'd for want of Water; while at the &s;ame time the Forces of the Barba|rians were overwhelm'd with Hail and Thunder. It appears to be a thing &s;o commonly known, that it is mention'd by the Poet <HI>Claudian,</HI> in 6. <HI>Con&s;. Hon.</HI></P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Chaldaea mago &s;eu carmina ritu</L>

<P><PB N="79" REF="102">And the Prodigy by which <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> cru&s;h'd the Rebellion of <HI>Eugenius,</HI> and <HI>Ar|bega&s;tes</HI> is al&s;o mention'd by the &s;ame Poet, in the&s;e words:

And that the Heathen Gods could give no help to Men, after that Je&s;us began to be wor&s;hipp'd, <HI>Eu&s;eb. lib.</HI> 5. <HI>praep. Evang.</HI> And <HI>Apollo</HI> de|clar'd from the Oracle, That certain ju&s;t Men, <HI>viz.</HI> the Chri&s;tians, hinder'd him to foretel the Truth, <HI>Eu&s;eb. de Vit. Con|&s;tant.</HI> and the Oracle at <HI>Delphos</HI> con|fe&s;s'd, That he could give no Re&s;pon&s;es, becau&s;e <HI>Babylas,</HI> the Martyr's Bones, were buried near him, as is related by <HI>Chry&s;oft. Orat.</HI> 2. <HI>in Babylam.</HI> In fine, it was a thing &s;o commonly known and ta|ken Notice of in the fir&s;t Ages of Chri|&s;tianity, that the Heathen Oracles were &s;truck dumb; that <HI>Plutarch</HI> wrote a Book concerning the Rea&s;on why the Oracles had ceas'd. And hence it appears, that this Power of working Miracles was con|tinu'd in the Chri&s;tian Church for the fir&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="103">
four Centuries; which adds great &s;trength and force to the Evidence, as being atte&s;ted by &s;uch a va&s;t Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es as liv'd in that large compa&s;s of time.</P>
<P>To conclude, I mu&s;t de&s;ire the Reader to take Notice, that the force of this Argu|ment con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the&s;e three things: 1. That if &s;uch Works were really per|form'd, as is pretended, they were true and proper Miracles, &s;uch as could only be done by the Almighty Power of God. 2. That we have &s;ufficient A&s;&s;urance that the&s;e Miracles were wrought by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and the other Di&s;ciples, to whom they are a&s;crib'd by tho&s;e that re|late them. 3. That the&s;e mighty Works were done in Confirmation of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the wonderful Works pretended to be done by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were true and real Miracles, &s;uch as could only be wrought by an Almighty Power, will appear, by con&s;idering, 1. That they could not be perform'd by the mo&s;t improved Arts and Skill of Men, or by any juggling Tricks and Frauds. To cure all Di&s;ea&s;es, and rai&s;e the Dead to Life again, by a Word-&s;peaking, are too great and mighty Works for Human Power and Skill in the highe&s;t improvement; they cannot cure Di&s;ea&s;es without the application of &s;ome
<PB N="81" REF="104">
proper Medicines, they cannot command a dead Carca&s;e to ri&s;e out of the Grave, and re&s;tore the Life and Soul to it again, after it has been dead three Days. The&s;e things appear &s;o plainly impo&s;&s;ible to the natural Powers of Mankind, that as it were ridi|culous for any Man to a&s;&s;ert the contrary, &s;o it were needle&s;s to confute them. But neither can they be done by the Tricks of Jugglers and Conjurers, who cheat and gull the People with the counterfeit ap|pearance of wonderful Feats, which they perform by unheeded Cau&s;es, and &s;ecret Ways of acting; for there could be no Trick us'd in mo&s;t of tho&s;e Miracles which were wrought; as in rai&s;ing <HI>Lazarus</HI> from the Dead, after he had lain three Days in the Grave, before many Specta|tors who knew that he was dead, and that the &s;ame <HI>Lazarus</HI> was now rais'd again; and it is altogether incredible, that a Cheat of this nature &s;hould be carried on thro' &s;o many in&s;tances, for &s;o long a time, and that none of the great Numbers that were concern'd in the Contrivance, nor of the Spectators, many of whom were Jews and Heathens, &s;hould di&s;cover the Cheat, e&s;pecially con&s;idering that the Contrivers could &s;erve no worldly End by impo&s;ing upon the World; but on the contrary they met with Bonds and Death for this
<PB N="82" REF="105">
pretended Trick; and many of the Specta|tors being learned and ingenious Men, of a contrary Religion, were &s;ufficiently able and &s;trongly inclin'd to have di&s;cover'd the Cheat, if there had been any, which yet was never done; and therefore we may certainly conclude, that the pretended Mi|racles were not wrought by juggling Tricks.</P>
<P N="2">2. Seeing the&s;e wonderful Works could not be done by the Power or Artifice of Men, they mu&s;t be wrought either by the Power of created Spirits, or the Almighty Power of God: But that they were not wrought by the Power of any created Spi|rits, will appear by con&s;idering, that they mu&s;t either be done by good Angels, or evil Spirits: As to good Angels, be&s;ides that many of the Works afore-mention'd appear to be above the Power of any Crea|ture, as we &s;hall &s;hew pre&s;ently, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that if they had been done by good Angels, this would be a demon&s;tra|tion of the truth of Chri&s;t's Revelation, no le&s;s than if they were wrought by a Power inherent in him&s;elf; for the good Angels are the Mini&s;ters of the heavenly Kingdom, and are &s;uppos'd always to do the Will of God, and de&s;ign the Welfare of Mankind. And it is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with all the Notions we have of them,
<PB N="83" REF="106">
that they &s;hould contribute &s;uch a mighty a&s;&s;i&s;tance to delude the World with a fal&s;e Doctrine; and to per&s;uade &s;o many Thou|&s;ands of its Preachers and Profe&s;&s;ors to endure the greate&s;t Mi&s;eries, and mo&s;t painful Deaths in the World, without any hopes of a future Reward in another Life for their pre&s;ent Sufferings: &s;uch a wic|ked Impo&s;ture is agreeable only to the Fal&s;hood and Malice of evil Spirits; and this indeed is the la&s;t Refuge and Strong|hold of Infidels, who denying the Truth of Chri&s;t's Revelation, a&s;cribe his wonder|ful Works to the Power of wicked Spirits, with whom, they &s;ay, he was confederate. So did the Jews in his own time; for when the Phari&s;ees heard of his healing one blind and dumb, who was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Devil, they &s;aid, <HI>This Fellow does not ca&s;t out Devils, but by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils,</HI> Mat. 12.24. <HI>i.e.</HI> He does it by a Confederacy with evil Spirits. A|gain&s;t which pretence Chri&s;t him&s;elf argues very &s;trongly in the following Ver&s;es, <HI>Eve|ry Kingdom divided again&s;t it &s;elf is brought to de&s;olation.&mdash;And if Satan ca&s;t out Sa|tan, he is divided again&s;t him&s;elf, how &s;hall then his Kingdom &s;tand?</HI> The meaning of which Argument is this, That he who op|po&s;es Devils and unclean Spirits, and drives them by force from the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="84" REF="107">
they have enjoy'd of Mens Bodies, cannot be &s;uppos'd to act by Collu&s;ion and Con|federacy with them, but mu&s;t be an Ene|my to them, and their De&s;igns; for the Devil cannot be thought to joyn with another to di&s;grace him&s;elf, to defeat his own De&s;igns, and ruin his Kingdom: but this appear'd plainly to be the De&s;ign of Chri&s;t, who <HI>went about doing good, and healing all that were oppre&s;s'd of the Devil:</HI> For he being a malicious Spirit, who de|lights in the Mi&s;ery and Ruin of Mankind, exercis'd a Dominion over the Bodies he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, inflicting upon them &s;everal Di|&s;ea&s;es, and depriving them of the u&s;e of their Sen&s;es, that he might keep them in &s;ubjection to him, and maintain his King|dom in the World: But, 1. Chri&s;t by di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Devils o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mens Bodies, and healing the Di&s;ea&s;es they had inflicted, de|&s;troy'd their Dominion, and ruin'd their De|&s;igns of Mi&s;chief again&s;t Mankind, which cannot be &s;uppos'd to be done by the De|vil's Concurrence, but mu&s;t be the Work of one that is an Enemy to him. 2. Our Saviour argues, that it mu&s;t not only be the Force of an Enemy, but a Force &s;upe|riour to the Power of the Devil, <HI>v.</HI>29. of the &s;aid twelfth Chapter of <HI>Matthew How can one enter into a &s;trong Man's Hou&s;e, and &s;poil his Goods, except he fir&s;t bind the &s;trong
<PB N="95" REF="108">
Man, and then he will &s;poil his Hou&s;e,</HI> i.e. the Devil having a quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mens Bodies, will hold it until he is forc'd to quit it; and he cannot be forc'd to leave it, but by a Power &s;uperiour to his own, which can conquer and overcome him. 3. I may add, that the Miracles of Chri&s;t were for the mo&s;t part Miracles of Mercy and Goodne&s;s to Mankind, whereby he fed the hungry, cur'd the &s;ick, and rais'd the dead to life; and &s;o they were directly contrary to the Temper and De&s;igns of the Devil, who &s;eeks by all means the Mi&s;ery and De&s;truction of Mankind; as appears plain|ly in tho&s;e Idolatrous Countries, where he requires the &s;acrificing of many thou&s;and Children every Year to &s;atiate his Cruelty, and therefore he cannot be &s;uppos'd to contribute to the good and merciful De|&s;ign of Chri&s;t's Miracles, which was &s;o contrary to his malicious and cruel Tem|per. 4. The Miracles of Chri&s;t were wrought to confirm his Doctrine, which tended directly to the overthrow of the Devil's Kingdom: For <HI>the Son of God was manife&s;ted to de&s;troy the Works of the Devil:</HI> Which he did effectually by turning Men from all their Idolatrous Practices, to wor|&s;hip the only true and living God, and from all tho&s;e unclean Lu&s;ts which reign'd with|out controul among the Gentiles, to a Life
<PB N="86" REF="109">
of the greate&s;t Purity and Holine&s;s: For the great De&s;ign of the Devil was to with|draw Mens Hearts from the true God, and their dependence upon him, to put their tru&s;t in Idols, and to draw to him&s;elf, and &s;uch-like wicked Spirits, all that Wor&s;hip and Adoration which is the peculiar Glory of God, whereby he gain'd an ab&s;olute Dominion over the Souls of Men, making them do that Homage to him&s;elf, which was only due to their Natural Lord and Maker, as he did over their Bodies, by alluring them to tho&s;e vile Lu&s;ts, which e&s;trange their Minds from God, and make them &s;it Receptacles for unclean Spirits. And in the&s;e two things the Kingdom of the Devil did chiefly con&s;i&s;t: But by the preaching of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t, this Kingdom of Darkne&s;s was &s;ubverted, his Altars were de&s;erted, his Temples demo|li&s;h'd, and all Men were taught every|where to wor&s;hip the true God, in Spirit and in Truth, and to abhor tho&s;e ob&s;cene Rites which &s;ome of the Gentiles made a part of their Religion. Seeing therefore that by the Doctrine of Chri&s;t Men were turn'd from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God, tho&s;e won|derful Works could not be wrought by the Power of evil Spirits, which confirm'd &s;uch a Doctrine as was directly contrary
<PB N="87" REF="110">
to the De&s;ign, and did effectually over|throw the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s. And this I think may be &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the Miracles of Chri&s;t were not wrought by the Power of evil Spirits, as the Pha|ri&s;ees alledg'd again&s;t him. But becau&s;e the &s;ame pretence has been made u&s;e of not only by Jews but Heathens, again&s;t all the Miracles which were pretended to be done by Chri&s;t, or his Apo&s;tles, or the Primitive Chri&s;tians in the fir&s;t four Centuries, which are a&s;crib'd to Magical or <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Arts, to Inchantments, or the &s;trange Power of Words, I &s;ay, becau&s;e the &s;ame pretence has been made u&s;e of again&s;t all other Miracles pretended to be done by any Chri&s;tians; (for the&s;e Magi|cal Arts, whatever they be, mu&s;t &s;ignifie a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with, and Concur|rence of evil Spirits, or el&s;e they &s;ignifie nothing di&s;tinct from the Power and Skill of Men) I &s;hall therefore add two or three Con&s;iderations relating to all the Miracles in general, which are pretended to be wrought for Confirmation of the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine. And, 1. The Miracles of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were &s;o many, &s;o great, done &s;o publickly and univer&s;ally, through &s;o many &s;everal Coun|tries, and the Power of working them was continued &s;o long in the Chri&s;tian Church,

that it is altogether incredible they &s;hould be done by Magical Arts, or the Power of evil Spirits; for who can believe that &s;uch a va&s;t number of mighty Works, for the &s;pace of four Centuries, as are pretended to be done in Confirmation of the Chri|&s;tian Religion, &s;hould be done by the Power of evil Spirits, when the like was never pretended to be done to confirm any other Religion that ever appear'd in the World: What Account can be given why evil Spirits &s;hould be &s;o mightily con|cern'd to propagate the Chri&s;tian Religi|on, above all the other Religions in the World?

If Chri&s;t learn'd his Magical Art in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and taught it to his Di&s;ciples, whereby they were ena|bled to work Miracles, as many both Jews and Heathens have alledg'd, how comes it to pa&s;s, that others who have been there, could never attain to the &s;ame Art, or teach it to others? Or why do not the <HI>Egyptians</HI> them&s;elves, who are the great Ma&s;ters of that Magical Art, &s;hew their Skill in it, by doing &s;o many and &s;o great Miracles as they taught Chri&s;t to do? But &s;ince neither they have ever done, nor any other from them could ever learn the Art of doing &s;uch mighty Works, &s;o far as has hitherto appear'd to the World, we may &s;afely conclude, that this pretence is a groundle&s;s and incredible &s;urmi&s;e. Be&s;ides, if Chri&s;t in&s;tructed his Apo&s;tles in the&s;e Magical Arts, they mu&s;t believe and know him to be an Impo&s;tor: And who then can

imagine, that ever any Men in their &s;ound Sen&s;es, &s;hould be willing to &s;acrifice their Lives and Fortunes for the &s;ake of a vile Forgery, as the Apo&s;tles did, when they might have &s;av'd them by detecting the Impo&s;ture.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are &s;everal Miracles attributed to Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, which &s;eem to be above the Power of evil Spirits: But &s;uppo&s;ing it were po&s;&s;ible for them to do all the&s;e Miracles, yet being &s;ubject to the Government of God, the great Creator and Governor of all things vi&s;ible and in|vi&s;ible, they could not do them without his leave and permi&s;&s;ion, which we cannot believe that he would grant, becau&s;e it ap|pears to be incon&s;i&s;tent with his infinite Goodne&s;s, to permit evil Spirits to work &s;o many and great Miracles, on purpo&s;e to delude the World with a Lye, and thereby expo&s;e Mankind to an invincible Tempta|tion to believe it. 'Tis true indeed, other Religions have pretended to Miracles wrought in Confirmation of them; but be&s;ides that they were neither &s;o many nor &s;o great, as are pretended by Chri&s;tians, there was always &s;ome means left for di&s;|covering the Impo&s;ture, either by the mul|titude of Gods which they wor&s;hipp'd, contrary to the Unity of the Godhead, which may be known, as has been prov'd,
<PB N="91" REF="114">
by natural Rea&s;on, or by the filthy and ob&s;cene, the barbarous and cruel Practices they enjoyn'd, which are plainly contrary to the natural Notions we have of God, and of Vertue and Vice: And it was ju&s;t with God to give them up to &s;trong Delu|&s;ions, that they &s;hould believe a Lye, be|cau&s;e that when they knew God, or might have known him by the Works of Crea|tion, they <HI>did not glorifie him as God, but wor&s;hipt the Creature more than the Creator,</HI> and allow'd them&s;elves in &s;uch unclean and cruel Rites, as are contrary to the na|tural Notions of the Divine Purity and Goodne&s;s; and we are certain that &s;uch a Religion cannot be from God, tho' it be confirm'd by Signs and Wonders. But when the Chri&s;tian Religion commands the Wor&s;hip of one God only, and en|joyns no Practice but what is pure, ju&s;t, and gentle, [as will appear in the next Chapter;] if God &s;hould be pleas'd to per|mit &s;uch a Religion to be confirm'd by evil Spirits, doing more and greater Mira|cles than ever were wrought for proof of any other Religion in the World, every one mu&s;t think him&s;elf oblig'd to believe it to be from God; becau&s;e there is no way left to di&s;cover &s;uch a Religion, ha|ving &s;uch &s;trong Evidence, to be an Im|po&s;ture: And therefore, &s;ince it is incon|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="92" REF="115">
with the Goodne&s;s of God to offer &s;uch a violent Temptation to Mankind to believe a Lye, we mu&s;t conclude, that he would never &s;uffer evil Spirits to work &s;o many and great Miracles in Confirmation of it.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides the Miracles which Chri&s;t him&s;elf wrought here on Earth, there were &s;everal illu&s;trious Te&s;timonies given to him from Heaven, which I &s;hall but briefly mention, as a farther Confirmation of his being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a Divine Power in the Miracles which he wrought. Of this nature was the Star which conducted the Wi&s;e Men from the <HI>East</HI> to <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> where he was born; the frequent Appa|ritions of Angels to mini&s;ter unto him, at his Conception and Birth, at his Tempta|tion in the Wilderne&s;s, in his Agony, at his Re&s;urrection and A&s;cen&s;ion into Hea|ven; &s;uch were the Voices that were heard from Heaven, te&s;tifying, that he was the beloved Son of God; at his Bapti&s;m, when <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t &s;aw the Heavens open'd, and the Spirit of God de&s;cending like a Dove, and lighting upon him; at his Transfiguration, when a bright Cloud over&s;hadow'd him and two of his Di&s;ci|ples, <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI>; and again, in his Agony, when Chri&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Father, glorifie thy Name</HI>; and a Voice was heard from
<PB N="93" REF="116">
Heaven, <HI>I have both glorified it, and will glorifie it again:</HI> Of the &s;ame nature were the Miracles and Prodigies that accompa|nied his Death on the Cro&s;s, both in Hea|ven and Earth, when there was Darkne&s;s over all the Earth, from the Sixth Hour to the Ninth, when the Veil of the Tem|ple was rent in twain, and the Earth did quake, and the Rocks rent, and the Graves were open'd, and many Bodies of Saints which &s;lept aro&s;e, and came out of the Graves after his Re&s;urrection, and went into the Holy City, and appear'd unto many; which Signs &s;o a&s;toni&s;h'd the Cen|turion and the <HI>Roman</HI> Soldiers that watch'd him, that they were forc'd to confe&s;s, <HI>Truly this was the Son of God, certainly this was a righteous Man.</HI> And indeed all the&s;e Miracles were &s;o many Divine Atte&s;tations of his Mi&s;&s;ion from God, and that he was the peculiar Favourite of Heaven, whom God was plea&s;ed &s;o far to honour; for as 'tis certain that no Human Power and Skill could perform or counterfeit &s;uch Signs from Heaven, &s;o neither is it conceivable that evil Spirits either could, or would give &s;o many glorious Te&s;timonies to him. But to conclude, The Miracles wrought by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and tho&s;e that were done by a &s;uperiour invi&s;ible Power in Atte&s;tation of him, were &s;o many and
<PB N="94" REF="117">
&s;o great, and extended to &s;o many Crea|tures both in Heaven and Earth, that none but he who had an univer&s;al and ab|&s;olute Dominion over all the Works of Nature could perform them, and therefore they were above the Power of evil Spi|rits, and could only be done by the Al|mighty Power of God, the Great Creator and Governor of all things.</P>
<P N="2">II. Having thus demon&s;trated, that the Miracles which we believe Je&s;us did, had all the Conditions of true Miracles, and were &s;uch that no Power but that of Al|mighty God could effect: Our next Bu&s;i|ne&s;s is to prove, that Chri&s;t did really work &s;uch Miracles; and this from the following Con&s;iderations will plainly ap|pear.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Miracles of our Saviour were not like Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and others of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, which are the Objects of <HI>Faith only,</HI> but they were plain Objects <HI>of our Sen&s;es,</HI> every Body pre&s;ent could &s;ee them; they were not done in a Corner, or in a particular &s;ecret Place, but publickly, before the Face of the Sun, &s;o that it can never be &s;aid that the&s;e Demon&s;trations of Omnipotency were &s;ubtile Deceits and Im|po&s;tures.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="95" REF="118">2. We have a con&s;tant Tradition of Chri&s;t's Miracles from the Apo&s;tles, thro' all Ages of Chri&s;tianity, even until now; the Hi&s;tory of them has been always the &s;ame, and never was, or can be contra|dicted.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e Miracles are not only acknow|ledged by the Chri&s;tians, but by their great|e&s;t Enemies: For even the Jews, among&s;t other things which they relate of Chri&s;t in their <HI>Talmud,</HI> make mention of his Miracles al&s;o. The <HI>Turks</HI> in their <HI>Alchoran</HI> have recorded &s;ome of Chri&s;t's Miracles, his Re|&s;urrection is commonly believ'd among&s;t them, they look upon him as a great Pro|phet, and as &s;uch profe&s;s a profound Ve|neration for him. La&s;tly, Several of the <HI>Jewi&s;h, Mahometan,</HI> and <HI>Heathen</HI> Writers, frequently mention Chri&s;t's Miracles; this the whole Chri&s;tian World knows better than I my &s;elf, I &s;hall not therefore now trouble you with particular Quotations out of the&s;e Authors.</P>
<P N="4">4. But &s;uppo&s;ing that we had not all the&s;e Te&s;timonies of Chri&s;t's Enemies to prove his Miracles, yet that of the Apo|&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts would be abundantly &s;ufficient, as we &s;hall more clearly &s;hew hereafter: For they had not the lea&s;t pro&s;pect of any temporal advantage by
<PB N="96" REF="119">
publi&s;hing the&s;e things; on the contrary they exa&s;perated the Powers of the World by it, and with their Blood &s;eal'd the Doctrines they had taught: this &s;urely is a valid Proof that the Miracles related in the Life of Chri&s;t, were really done by him.</P>
<P N="3">III. That our Saviour wrought the&s;e Miracles in Confirmation of his Religion, appears, from what he &s;aid to the Di|&s;ciples of <HI>John</HI> when they came and ask|ed him whether he was the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>he that is to come</HI>; he an&s;wered, <HI>Go, and tell John what you have &s;een,</HI> &amp;c. And from what he had &s;aid to the Jews, <HI>If you will not believe me, at lea&s;t believe the Works I do in the Name of my Father.</HI> There are many other places in Holy Scripture, which &s;hew that the principal End of Chri&s;t's Miracles was to confirm his Doctrine.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Of the Object of Chri&s;tian Religion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Evidences for the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion being thus produc'd and exa|min'd, we come next to the <HI>Object</HI> of it. We have already a&s;&s;erted, that the true Religion mu&s;t have for its Object, 1. A|bove all things the Honour and Glory of God. 2. The univer&s;al Happine&s;s of Man|kind. 3. The Good of every Man in particular. For the clearer under&s;tanding of this, we &s;hall divide the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, 1. Into the <HI>Credenda,</HI> or what a Chri&s;tian ought to believe. 2. The <HI>Agen|da,</HI> or the Precepts he &s;hould practice; and if we find both the&s;e Parts of Chri&s;tian Religion have the afore&s;aid Object, we may &s;afely conclude it is the true Religion. My De&s;ign (as I have intimated el&s;ewhere) is not to run over and repeat the Princi|ples of all Religions, but only to demon|&s;trate the Excellency of the Chri&s;tian by its Object, well knowing that all other Religions fall infinitely &s;hort of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to its <HI>Credenda.</HI> It is true there are but few Nations which do not believe one Supreme Being; but how gro&s;ly are
<PB N="98" REF="121">
they mi&s;taken in their Notions of him? Some rob him of his chiefe&s;t Attributes: Some repre&s;ent him &s;ubject to almo&s;t all the Pa&s;&s;ions of Human Nature, and this leads them into &s;uch weak and pernicious Principles and Practices, that Men [of com|mon Sence] of contrary Opinions, are a|&s;ham'd to hear of; but the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion teacheth not only God's Exi&s;tence, but his Attributes al&s;o in the highe&s;t per|fection that our Under&s;tanding is capable to bear. Whereas other Religions adore a plurality of Gods, this teacheth to wor|&s;hip one God in Unity: Some make him material, this an incomprehen&s;ible Spirit. Some again deny his Providence, or &s;o a&s;|&s;ert his Sublimity that he neglects &s;ublu|nary Things, as Matters much beneath his Government: But the Chri&s;tian Religion teacheth us, that his Providence is Omni|pre&s;ent, and a&s;&s;ures us of his great Love and tender Care over all his Creatures. In &s;hort, his Goodne&s;s, Mercy, Long-&s;uffer|ing, Ju&s;tice, his infinite Power, Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are plainly preach'd and de|mon&s;trated by Je&s;us the Author of Chri|&s;tian Religion. What a mi&s;erable State then are tho&s;e in who deny the Provi|dence of God? They are Men without Faith, without Hope; are they groaning under Afflictions, they dare not call upon
<PB N="99" REF="122">
him for Deliverance! Are they in their la&s;t Agonies, where can be their Tru&s;t and Confidence? But we are taught that this God is the Creator, Pre&s;erver, and Governour of all Things; we know he ob&s;erveth all our Actions, and this makes us mindful of our Duty; we are &s;ure that he giveth us the Fruits of the Earth, Suc|ce&s;s, Honour, Life, Health, Children, and all other Ble&s;&s;ings; and this obligeth us to be thankful to that infinite Goodne&s;s which be&s;tow'd them upon us: We be|lieve he orders all Events, as Di&s;ea&s;es, Death of Friends, Cro&s;&s;es and Afflictions; this &s;hews us the great Mercy of God, who &s;courgeth and puni&s;heth us, that we may repent, and return to our Obedience. Other Religions indeed oblige Men to con|fe&s;s the Frailty of their Nature, to acknow|ledge the Crimes they daily commit, and the Evils to which they are inclin'd; yet it gives them no other Remedies for the appea&s;ing the Ju&s;tice of an angry God, but the Sacrifices of Bea&s;ts and of Men. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, it is not &s;o with us, we know we are Sinners, but we are con|fident that the God of infinite Mercy will, upon Repentance, forgive us all our Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t his be|loved Son, who died for our Sins, ro&s;e again for our Ju&s;tification, and a&s;cended
<PB N="100" REF="123">
into Heaven, to be our Advocate, Me|diator, and Interce&s;&s;or with the Father: This is the greate&s;t Con&s;olation Man can wi&s;h; for whil&s;t others are concern'd to appea&s;e their God by an infinite multitude of Sacrifices, and the&s;e attended with &s;o great a number of Ceremonies, Chri&s;tians enjoy a perfect Ttranquility and Freedom, relying entirely upon God's infinite Mercy, praying, extolling, and magnifying it without end. Yet this is not all that God hath done for us; he hath not only &s;ent his Son to be an Expiation for our Sins, but al&s;o to be our Prophet and Teacher, to in&s;truct us in the Will of his Father, by preaching publickly in the Synagogues of the Jews, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e whom he had cho&s;en to be Witne&s;&s;es of his Life and Doctrine; and after the time of his Mi&s;|&s;ion was expired, and he a&s;cended into Heaven, he &s;ent the Holy Gho&s;t the Com|forter to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, in planting the Reli|gion he left with them; be&s;tow'd the Gift of Miracles upon them to confirm it; and for the better propagation of it he e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd a Communion and Congregation of Saints, into which all Men may be intro|duced who repent and have Faith. La&s;tly, He has left two Covenants, <HI>viz.</HI> the Sa|craments, in his Church, by which he con|veys his Graces and Ble&s;&s;ings to us. The&s;e,
<PB N="101" REF="124">
and more, are the wonderful Works of the infinite Goodne&s;s and Mercy of God; which when we reflect upon, we cannot but &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>What is Man, O Lord! that thou art mindful of him,</HI> &amp;c. This I think &s;ufficient, to &s;hew how much the <HI>Credenda</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Religion are for the Honour and Glory of God, the uni|ver&s;al Happine&s;s of Mankind, and the Good of every Man in particular.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Agenda,</HI> or Precepts which a Chri&s;tian ought to practice, are no le&s;s for the Honour and Glory of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That they far excel the Rules of all other Reli|gions there can be no di&s;pute. The Jews indeed have the Decalogue, or Ten Com|mandments, as well as we; But how &s;trict|ly do they interpret them? And how far has Chri&s;t extended them? The Jews think if they are not Idolaters, or Bla&s;phemers, if they ob&s;erve the Sabbath by not doing any manner of Work, if they honour Fa|ther and Mother, if they do not Murther, Steal, commit Adultery, bear Fal&s;e Wit|ne&s;s, or are not Covetous; if they ob&s;erve the Ceremonies and Fe&s;tivals which the Law pre&s;cribeth, and ab&s;tain from the &s;e|veral Meats it forbiddeth, then they think they have done their Duty, and that God is obliged to give them the promi&s;ed Re|ward. But the Precepts of the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="102" REF="125">
Religion extend yet farther, as we &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew.</P>
<P>God forbid the Pagan Religion &s;hould any ways be compared to the Chri&s;tian, which is &s;o far from glorifying God, that the Honour which is only due to the Crea|tor it giveth to the Creature, and teacheth Men to wor&s;hip Idols, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, nay [for fear] the very Devils, and to &s;acrifice their very Children to them; it obligeth its Devotees to the utmo&s;t Cruel|ty to their own Bodies, under the Notion of Holine&s;s, Merit; it allows, even pre|&s;cribes the Impurity of Polygamy, and o|ther Uncleanne&s;s: In a word, in&s;tead of bringing Men to that degree of Holine&s;s, without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord, it makes them Reprobates, and throws them into the la&s;t degree of Imperfection, condemning all Graces and Vertues where|by we over-rule our Pa&s;&s;ions as fooli&s;h and idle Notions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But lea&s;t, contrary to my purpo&s;e, I &s;hould make too great a di|gre&s;&s;ion in comparing the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion to all others, I &s;hall return, and em|ploy the re&s;t of this Section in &s;hewing, that the Chri&s;tian Religion is not only a|bove all others, but al&s;o that it brings a Man to Regeneration and that perfect Holi|ne&s;s, which is the end of his Creation.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="126">If we con&s;ider the Precepts of Chri&s;tia|nity as the Rules of Human Life, we &s;hall find them the mo&s;t accurately adapted to our Nature, as ever were made known to the World, no ways contradictory to our Rea&s;on, but tend to make mortal Man per|fect, even as God is perfect: The greate&s;t Libertines who do not live up to them, yet approve of them. By the&s;e Precepts we are taught, Fir&s;t, Our Duty to our Maker, to believe in him, to fear him, to love him above all things; to tru&s;t and depend entirely upon him, to do his Will with all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; to wor&s;hip him with pure Hearts, not with Sacrifices, for he eats not the Fle&s;h of Bulls, or drinks the Blood of Goats; they in&s;truct us how to call upon him, and with fervent Zeal and Under&s;tanding, and unwearied Con&s;tancy, to offer up our Petitions to him; to prai&s;e and glorifie his Holy Name for all the Be|nefits we and all Mankind have receiv'd from him &s;ince the Creation of the World. The&s;e Duties are founded upon the highe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olid Rea&s;on; and all that be|lieve there is a God mu&s;t perform them: For whom &s;hall we fear, but him that is Almighty?

Shall we wor&s;hip him with Sacrifices of Bea&s;ts, who is an eternal Spirit? Briefly, &s;ince on Earth we petition our Superiours, if we will ob|tain any Favours from them, and we pay our grateful Acknowledgments for them when received; infinitely more are we obliged upon all occa&s;ions to pray to that God, upon whom our being and well-being depends; and to offer up our Prai&s;e and Thank&s;|givings to him who hath be&s;tow'd &s;o ma|ny Benefits upon us. Thus our Duty to God has not only his Glory for its Ob|ject, but our own Good and Welfare al&s;o.</P>
<P>Our Duty to our Neighbour gives us the mo&s;t incomparable Rules for Government, Society, and Friend&s;hip; for it aims at the good of all Men in general, and of every Man in particular; it requires from us O|bedience to our Governours and Superiors, even when they unju&s;tly u&s;e us, and per|&s;ecute us; it teacheth us the greate&s;t Mer|cy, Love, and Humanity, one to another, obliging us to forgive our bittere&s;t Ene|mies, and to pray for our Slanderers and Tormenters; it will not permit us to ren|der evil for evil, but on the contrary com|mands

<P>Our Duty to our &s;elves has the &s;ame Ob|ject as the two former: It commands us the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t profound Humility, the greate&s;t Meekne&s;s and Patience under our Sufferings and Reproaches; to be content in what&s;oever State of Life it &s;hall plea&s;e God to call us; to have an un&s;haken Faith, un&s;potted Cha&s;tity, and to pre&s;evere to the la&s;t Moment of our Lives; to be tempe|rate in Meats and Drinks, and all Recrea|tions; to follow our Callings with dili|gence; it gives us a &s;ingular Mode&s;ty, Sim|plicity, Gravity, and Sincerity of Heart; it teacheth us to deny our &s;elves, to de|&s;pi&s;e worldly things, and hunger and thir&s;t after Righteou&s;ne&s;s; to husband well the Talent God hath given us; to follow the things that are pure, hone&s;t, of good re|port, and prai&s;e-worthy; it commands nothing that is unaccountable, nothing

that is ba&s;e and unbecoming rea&s;onable Creatures; all our Actions are moderated by it, we ought to be as innocent as Doves, but as wi&s;e as Serpents; we ought to be mode&s;t and humble, but not afraid to appear in the defence of Truth; we ought to do Ju&s;tice, but not to be unmer|ciful; we ought to bear Injuries, but not to be &s;en&s;le&s;s of them; we mu&s;t be kind to all Men, but without any Pride or Af|fectation; and thus are all Chri&s;tian Ver|tues moderated.

Our Corruption is &s;o great, and our vicious Inclinations &s;o &s;trong, that without a certain belief of future Re|wards and Puni&s;hments, it would be very difficult for us to walk in the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Paths of Religion: For how can we con|ceive a Man &s;hould extingui&s;h his violent Pa&s;&s;ion for a darling Plea&s;ure, had he not &s;ure hopes (by thus mortifying him&s;elf to the World) of a more &s;ub&s;tantial Good, and of avoiding an everla&s;ting Mi&s;ery?</P>
<P>Whether we con&s;ider the&s;e Rewards in re&s;pect to God, or regard to our own Souls,
<PB N="108" REF="131">
they are far more glorious and adapt than what any other Religion affords. What others have feigned to encourage Men to do good, is indeed not a little enticing, but yet it is directly contrary to the Na|ture of God, and our Souls; for in&s;tance: Their Notions of Metemp&s;ycho&s;is, or the Tran&s;migration of the Soul into another Body, more noble or ignoble; delightful charming Places; Riches; Plurality of Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which can never agree with the Eternal Almighty God, neither with our rea&s;onable Souls, they are Spirits which can never be &s;atisfied with temporal things, they came from God, and naturally de&s;ire to return to him, no Plea&s;ure can &s;uffi|ciently content them, but the infinite Hap|pine&s;s of enjoying their Creator. 2. Our Bodies have their part in the&s;e Promi&s;es as well as our Souls: For is it not ju&s;t, that the Body which has accompanied the Soul through many Trials and Afflictions, for the &s;ake of God, &s;hould &s;hare in its Re|wards al&s;o? Is it not rea&s;onable, that the Body which has been depriv'd of &s;o many Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures, &s;hould, with the Soul, be Partaker of eternal Happine&s;s? The Re&s;urrection of the Body mu&s;t therefore be a great Con&s;olation to us; our Saviour proved it to the Jews, out of the Books of the Law and the Prophets, he laid the
<PB N="109" REF="132">
Foundation of this Truth, and we are &s;ure our Faith is not vain, &s;ince he is ri&s;en from the dead. To &s;ay, that the &s;catter'd Particles of our di&s;&s;olv'd Bodies cannot be collected again, is an Objection &s;o weak, that it de&s;erves not an An&s;wer; for cer|tainly the Almighty Creator of Man out of nothing, cannot only re&s;tore him to his former State after his di&s;&s;olution, but en|due him al&s;o with a perfect Under&s;tand|ing, and a perpetual Vigour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We &s;ee then the&s;e Rewards are not &s;uch &s;en|&s;ual Banquets as the Jews vulgarly believe; nor &s;uch a Fool's Paradi&s;e, a plurality of Women, as the <HI>Turks</HI> expect; nor the Wandrings of the Soul from one Body to another, as the Heathens dream; but it is an infinite Spiritual Happine&s;s we are promi&s;ed, the greate&s;t our Heart can wi&s;h, or that a created Being is capable of, we &s;hall enjoy the Beatific Vi&s;ion, God will dwell in us, we &s;hall prai&s;e him with joy|ful Hallelujahs for ever and ever; we &s;hall be free from Hunger and Thir&s;t, from all Doubtfulne&s;s of Thought, Sorrow, Pain, and Death; in &s;hort, we &s;hall be perfectly happy, for we &s;hall live in the Lord, and he in us. When we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider this, we &s;hall be ready to part with everything, even our Lives, for eternal Salvation; &s;uch perfection of Bli&s;s will make all the
<PB N="110" REF="133">
Righteous (with St. <HI>Paul</HI>) mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;irous to leave this World of Sin and Mi&s;eries, and to be di&s;&s;olv'd to be with Chri&s;t; the Apo&s;tle experimentally knew what this Happine&s;s was, when he thus explain'd it to the <HI>Corinthians, Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither hath it en|tred into the Heart of Man to conceive, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</HI> We &s;hall now briefly con|&s;ider the Woes and Puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>As God hath promi&s;ed &s;uch great and glorious Rewards to them that love him, and are obedient to his Commands, &s;o he hath pronounced mo&s;t terrible Woes and Judgments again&s;t them that act the con|trary: Is it not rea&s;onable to think, that God who is merciful to the Righteous, &s;hould be ju&s;t to the Wicked and the Im|penitent? And if the Rewards of the Good are inexpre&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t not the Pu|ni&s;hments of tho&s;e who die in their Sins be the utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery? I &s;hould be too tedi|ous if I repeated here all the Expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed in Holy Scripture, to make us &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;erable State of the Damned; I &s;hall therefore make &s;ome Reflections on what has been &s;aid, and &s;o conclude this Section.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="111" REF="134">1. The belief of the&s;e Woes and Tor|ments deterreth us from committing Sin, and quickens us to Repentance and a holy Life: For no Man can hope for eternal Life, but by doing the Will of God; ever|la&s;ting Flames mu&s;t be his Portion, who dies without Repentance.</P>
<P N="2">2. It breeds a dread and fear in us of the great and jealous God, a God that will not be mocked; it teacheth us to tremble at his Word, to con&s;ider his in|finite Ju&s;tice, and the fiercene&s;s of his Wrath.</P>
<P N="3">3. We are hereby taught to put a true Value upon the Work of our Redemption, for if we believe not an Eternity of Tor|ments, we can never &s;ufficiently e&s;teem the Ran&s;om Chri&s;t paid for us; whereas he who reflects upon the Glories he had lo&s;t, and the infinite Mi&s;ery he had de&s;erv'd, cannot but be mo&s;t thankful for &s;o plente|ous a Redemption.</P>
<P>The belief that God has laid up glori|ous Rewards for tho&s;e that love him, is u&s;eful,</P>
<P N="1">1. To wean our Affections and De&s;ires from the Plea&s;ures of this Life, to create in us a contempt of this World, and to teach us to prefer Heaven before all things.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="112" REF="135">2. It encourageth us to take up the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and willingly and cheer|fully to &s;uffer all Afflictions for his Name|&s;ake, a&s;&s;uring us in the Words of the Apo|&s;tle St. <HI>Paul, That the Sufferings of this pre|&s;ent time are not to be compared with the Glory that &s;hall be reveal'd.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. X. Several other Proofs for the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HEAD>
<P>MY Guide having thus proved the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion by its Evidences and its Object, he gave me &s;ome other Arguments to confirm me, which are not of a little value. I &s;hall con|tract them as much as I can.</P>
<P N="1">1. As the Jews own that there was a Me&s;&s;ias promi&s;ed, &s;o they cannot deny but that they crucified a Man who&s;e Name was <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> in whom we find all that's foretold of the Me&s;&s;ias in the Old Te&s;tament ful|filled; as, that he &s;hould be born of a Virgin, in the City of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> of the Tribe
<PB N="113" REF="136">
of <HI>Judah,</HI> and of the Po&s;terity of <HI>David</HI>; that he &s;hould begin to preach in <HI>Galilee,</HI> do many Miracles, be the Saviour not only of the Jews but the Gentiles al&s;o, that he &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h the Wor&s;hip of one true God, and de&s;troy that of Idols and fal&s;e Gods; that he &s;hould be betray'd, and &s;old for Thirty Pieces of Silver, the Time, Manner, and Circum&s;tances of his Suffer|ings and Death; the very parting his Garment, the Scoffs of the Multitude, his Behaviour, la&s;t Words, the exempting his Bones from being broken, his honourable Burial, his Re&s;urrection, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All that was predicted and prefigur'd of old, was ac|compli&s;h'd in him, &s;o that undoubtedly this Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, and his Religion came from God.</P>
<P N="2">2. My Guide noted to me the extraor|dinary manner how the&s;e Prophecies were fulfilled; of which take two or three Ex|amples: Is it not wonderful, that he who had &s;o many Enemies, &s;hould be betrayed by one of his own Di&s;ciples; that he &s;hould be condemn'd to Death whom the Judge declared innocent; that he who had of|tentimes e&s;caped being &s;toned, &s;hould at la&s;t be crucified; and yet had he been guilty of what he was accu&s;ed, by the Law of the Country, he ought to have been &s;toned; that he who was crucified (which
<PB N="114" REF="137">
was a <HI>Roman</HI> and not a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Puni&s;hment) &s;hould be &s;o honourably buried; that none of his Bones &s;hould be broken, tho' it was the Cu&s;tom to break the Bones of the Cru|cified, and it was then practis'd upon the two Thieves? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e things are &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing, that we cannot &s;ufficiently ad|mire and adore the infinite Wi&s;dom of God, who in his Son Je&s;us has fulfilled what&s;oever was foretold of the Me&s;|&s;ias.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fulfilling of Chri&s;t's Prophecies again&s;t the Jews, their Temple and City: For in the time foretold by our Saviour, the <HI>Romans,</HI> under their Emperor <HI>Titus,</HI> did conquer the City, demoli&s;h'd the Tem|ple, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and ever &s;ince that time the Jews have been di&s;pers'd over the whole Earth, and never &s;ince have had any Power or Government.</P>
<P N="4">4. The wonderful progre&s;s of the Apo|&s;tles and their Succe&s;&s;ors, in propagating the Chri&s;tian Religion. This Argument will be no advantage to the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> for their Opinions were propagated by other Methods. And here, 1. Let us con|&s;ider the Author and Preachers of the Chri|&s;tian Religion. 2. The Religion it &s;elf. 3. The Manner of its propagation.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Author of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion was <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Son of a poor Virgin,
<PB N="115" REF="138">
and the reputed Son of a Carpenter, his Birth in a Stable in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> his Educa|tion in <HI>Galilaea,</HI> his Sufferings, and igno|minious Death on the Cro&s;s among&s;t Ma|lefactors; the&s;e are greater Hindrances than Helps to the &s;preading of Chri&s;t's Doctrines; but notwith&s;tanding &s;o mighti|ly grew the Word of Chri&s;t, and prevail'd, that it threw down all Super&s;tition and fal&s;e Religion; which it could never have done, had not the Power of Almighty God went along with it. The Preachers of the Go&s;pel were not Princes of great Wealth and Authority, but poor Trade&s;|men; they were not Men of great Learn|ing, educated in famous Univer&s;ities, but mean ob&s;cure <HI>Galileans,</HI> Men of Peace and Humility, they were very unlikely to do any notable things, &s;ince they wanted world|ly Wi&s;dom and Power to gain them Repu|tation and Authority. This is the true Character of the Primitive Preachers of the Go&s;pel. The&s;e Men therefore by their own Cunning and Strength, could never have been able to baffle the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> the Power of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Malice of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Ob&s;tinacy of <HI>Idolaters</HI>; we may as ea&s;ily believe that a Sheep could worry a hundred ravenous Wolves, as that the&s;e Men &s;hould have prevail'd again&s;t &s;o many Ob&s;tacles of Men
<PB N="116" REF="139">
and Devils, and per&s;uaded the World to for&s;ake their old Way of Wor&s;hip, and to believe in Chri&s;t crucified: We mu&s;t then conclude, that &s;ince they have done all this, the Omnipotent God a&s;&s;i&s;ted them; it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be an infinite Power, that by &s;uch weak ob&s;cure Men could bring &s;uch mighty Things to pa&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the Religion it &s;elf, altho' as we have already prov'd, it is the mo&s;t ex|cellent and perfect of all, yet it had &s;everal Articles of Faith, and Rules of Practice, that were as &s;o many Stumbling-blocks to the Heathen; among the former, is the Creation of the World, which &s;urely was &s;trange Doctrine to them who believ'd, <HI>Ex nihilo nihil fit,</HI> i. e. Out of nothing can be made nothing; they that had hi|therto believed there were many Gods, could not ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded there is but one. The Doctrines of the Trinity in Unity, and the Unity in Trinity, and of the Re&s;urrection of Bodies, &s;eem'd very ab&s;urd at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens</HI>; and yet all the&s;e Doctrines as &s;trange and di&s;agreeable as they appear'd, were received in the&s;e places, which could never have been, had not God's miraculous Providence given &s;uch wonderful Succe&s;s: And had not the &s;ame Power attended the Preaching the Rules of Practice, the corrupt World had
<PB N="117" REF="140">
never receiv'd them; for the Go&s;pel com|mands us to deny all Ungodline&s;s, and to live righteou&s;ly, ju&s;tly, and &s;oberly; it forbids not only evil Actions, but evil Thoughts al&s;o; it is &s;o far from permit|ting us to do Injuries, that it will not al|low us Vengeance for tho&s;e offer'd to us; not only Adultery, but even impure Ima|ginations are forbidden by it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But it will &s;eem yet more &s;trange, if we con|&s;ider,</P>
<P N="3">3. The Manner of the fir&s;t propagation of the Go&s;pel: It owes not its Succe&s;s to the Eloquence or Rhetorick of the Apo|&s;tles, they were illiterate ignorant Men, and under&s;tood no more of School-Learn|ing, than one born blind does of Colours; their Birth and Fortune were mean and ob&s;cure, they never a&s;&s;i&s;ted in Senates, or in the Councils of Princes; they were not great Lawyers, able to defend any Cau&s;e; in &s;hort, they had no bright Qualifications to recommend them to the Princes of the World; under the&s;e heavy Di&s;advantages they propagated the Chri&s;tian Religion to a wicked, perver&s;e, and powerful Genera|tion. St. <HI>Paul</HI> indeed was a Learned Man, and had all the Benefits of a Generous Education, neverthele&s;s he tells us, that <HI>he determin'd to know nothing but Je&s;us Chri&s;t and him crucified</HI>; and <HI>that neither his
<PB N="118" REF="141">
&s;peech, nor his preaching, was with the en|ticing words of man's wi&s;dom.</HI> So that the Succe&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Religion is &s;till owing to the Power of God alone.</P>
<P>War, and the Arm of Fle&s;h, by which <HI>Mahomet</HI> propagated his Opinions, had no &s;hare in the advancement of the Go&s;pel; the Jew nor the Gentile need not be afraid of the Sword of the Apo&s;tles, for they were forbidden all Violence and Cruelty, their Ma&s;ter did not &s;end them out as Bea&s;ts of Prey, but like Sheep in the mid&s;t of Wolves, he was the Ma&s;ter of Peace, and they his Servants, and therefore they came not to denounce War, but to bring Peace and Glad-Tidings, and to per&s;uade the Soldier to &s;heath his Sword: Princes and States, in&s;tead of protecting them, u&s;e them cruelly, and per&s;ecuted them from City to City, and yet they had no other Armour but Faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, nor any Sword but that of the Word of God, and with the&s;e they overcame the Nations, and brought them under the Obedience of the Go&s;pel. The continual Sufferings, Tri|bulations, Afflictions, and Per&s;ecutions, which the Apo&s;tles and their Pro&s;elytes were expo&s;ed to, one would think &s;hould very much hinder the &s;preading of the Doctrine they preach'd; Prayers and Tears were the only Weapons they u&s;ed, and yet
<PB N="119" REF="142">
the Blood of the Martyrs was that fruitful Seed of the Church, &s;o that Thou&s;ands daily embrac'd Chri&s;tianity. This won|derful Progre&s;s of it my Guide laid before me, as one Argument, that it is the only true Religion: He urged many more than what I have mention'd, as the Re&s;urre|ction and A&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, his &s;ending the Holy Gho&s;t to his Apo&s;tles, the won|derful Gifts they receiv'd by it, of &s;peak|ing all Languages; working Miracles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But I need not mention any more, being convinc'd that every rea&s;onable Man (if he con&s;idereth what has been &s;aid) mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the Chri&s;tian Religion excels all others in its Evidences, Object, Matters of Faith, Precepts, Rewards and Puni&s;h|ments, and that it comes from God, and is the only true Religion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, in the la&s;t place, proceed to tell you the Objections I brought again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Religion, and the An&s;wers my good Guide made to them.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XI. The Objections I made against the Chri&s;tian Religion, with their So|lutions.</HEAD>
<P>THE Arguments I brought again&s;t the Exi&s;tence of a God, his Attributes, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of a reveal'd Religion were &s;o weak, that they are not worth mentioning; they were only the common Opinions of my Country-men, and my Guide an&s;wer'd them &s;o clearly that I could make no manner of Reply: So that the fir&s;t Objection that &s;eem'd to have any force was this:</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. How can I now be certain, that what the Evangeli&s;ts and Apo&s;tles a&s;|&s;ert is Truth; for they might impo&s;e upon us, and write things which never were perform'd.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> To this my Guide an&s;werd: 1. That he &s;uppos'd the Divine Writers were able to tell us the Truth, and to give us a true and perfect Hi&s;tory of the Life and Death of the Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS. 2. That they were very willing to do &s;o. No
<PB N="121" REF="144">
Man can doubt that they were able to &s;peak the truth; for they did not write the Hi&s;tory of Things which happen'd in Ages pa&s;t, and long before they were born, or of what was done in remote Parts of the World: But the things they deliver down to us they &s;aw with their own Eyes, heard with their own Ears, and felt with their own Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>John</HI> ob&s;erves. Mo&s;t of the&s;e Writers were con|&s;tant Attendants on our Saviour, from his fir&s;t preaching to the end of his Life; &s;o that if they publi&s;h'd any Untruths, we mu&s;t attribute them rather to their De&s;igns and Intentions to impo&s;e upon us, than their Ignorance: But by the following Con&s;iderations it will appear, they were willing as well as able to tell us the naked Truth.</P>
<P N="1">1. It cannot be imagin'd they could forge the Hi&s;tory of the Life of Chri&s;t; How could poor Fi&s;her-men, ignorant Me|chanicks, Men without Learning, contrive &s;uch a Fiction as &s;hould in all re&s;pects &s;o exactly agree?</P>
<P N="2">2. Suppo&s;ing they had been cunning Sophi&s;ters, and &s;ubtle enough to invent &s;uch a Hi&s;tory, could they have the Face to undertake &s;uch a De&s;ign, and impo&s;e &s;uch a Forgery on the World, when there were multitudes of living Witne&s;&s;es (and
<PB N="122" REF="145">
tho&s;e their implacable Enemies) to contra|dict them? If the&s;e Writers had been found Liars, they would &s;oon have been detected and carried before the Magi&s;trate, and pu|ni&s;h'd according to their De&s;erts; be&s;ides, it was the Intere&s;t and Re&s;olution of tho&s;e Magi&s;trates to hinder the propagation of that Doctrine, who&s;e Author they had with the utmo&s;t Malice and Aver&s;ion per&s;e|cuted even unto Death.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e Writers were godly, righteous, and &s;ober Men; they have confe&s;s'd their own Faults publickly which before were unknown to us, as their &s;lowne&s;s in belie|ving, their Di&s;putes about preheminence, their leaving and for&s;aking their Lord and Ma&s;ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and con&s;equently they can|not be thought guilty of this wicked de|&s;ign.</P>
<P N="4">4. And la&s;tly, For what end &s;hould they thus delude us? What advantage could they expect by &s;o doing? Not Honour and Glory, for they were continually re|vil'd and derided as Fools and Mad-men; not Riches, or any other Temporal Bene|fit, for the Go&s;pel they preach'd, taught them to renounce all and follow Chri&s;t, and accordingly their Reputation, Goods, and Lives, were daily in danger, they were hurried from one place to another, as Re|bels and Bla&s;phemers, they were per&s;ecu|ted
<PB N="123" REF="146">
and tormented, and at la&s;t &s;uffer'd the cruelle&s;t Deaths that Malice could invent. Impo&s;tors would never have &s;ubmitted to &s;uch Trials. Is it po&s;&s;ible for Men joy|fully, and with alacrity to undergo all man|ner of Racks and Tortures for the &s;ake of a Religion they knew to be fal&s;e, e&s;pecial|ly when they might have been crown'd with Honours and Preferments had they deny'd it? The&s;e things well con&s;ider'd, we cannot but believe the Divine Writers were true and faithful Hi&s;torians.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. How can I be &s;ure that the Books we now have of the New Te&s;ta|ment, are the &s;ame the Evangeli&s;ts and the Apo&s;tles penn'd, and that in Succe&s;&s;ion of Time they have not been changed and al|tered?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. He an&s;wer'd me, That the va&s;t Numbers of the&s;e Books which have been di&s;pers'd thro' the whole World, and tran&s;|lated almo&s;t into all Languages, their &s;till bearing the Names of the &s;ame Authors, and the agreement of the different Ver|&s;ions, plainly prove, they have been al|ways the &s;ame; neither can it be con|ceiv'd that di&s;tant Nations that &s;carce ever had any Commerce or Corre&s;pondence with each other, &s;hould all con&s;pire in the &s;ame Cheat, and alter the Holy Wri|tings.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="124" REF="147">2. Since there are &s;uch Divi&s;ions, and &s;o many Sects among&s;t the Chri&s;tians, had either of them added or dimini&s;h'd any thing in favour of their own Opinions, the re&s;t would have done the like; but it appears thro' all Ages the Bible has been appeal'd to by all Parties. This &s;atisfied me, that the Holy Scripture is now the &s;ame as was generally given to us.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. I objected again&s;t the Miracles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, as not &s;ufficient to denominate it the true Religion; for the Jewi&s;h, and &s;ome of the Pagan Reli|gions, have been e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Miracles; &s;o that were Miracles &s;ufficient, all the&s;e Religions would be true; which is con|trary to what has el&s;ewhere been a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. Miracles are not alone a &s;uffi|cient Proof of the true Religion, but only a Confirmation of it (as we have before ob&s;erv'd); if therefore they are not agree|able to the Doctrines and Precepts of the true Religion they will be of very little value.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Wonders done by the Pagans have not the three Conditions of a true Miracle; <HI>viz.</HI> 1. He that does the Miracle mu&s;t know it, and be willing to do it. 2. It mu&s;t exceed all Art and Natural Power. 3. It mu&s;t be certainly perform'd and come to pa&s;s. But the Wonders the&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="148">
Pagan Prophets are reported to have done, was only the foretelling the Calamities that &s;hould befal their Country; their Predictions did not exceed the Knowledge of Natural Philo&s;ophers, they only told you of the probability of Thunders, Light|nings, Earthquakes, and other Effects of Natural Cau&s;es. La&s;tly, There is no cer|tainty that the&s;e things happened accord|ing to the Times they mention'd; for the <HI>Jarhabadiond,</HI> or the Pagans Book of their Law, in which the&s;e Wonders are record|ed, is &s;o carefully kept by their Prie&s;ts, that no Man el&s;e is &s;uffer'd to read it, if he were able. The&s;e Wonders therefore of the Pagans wanting the three nece&s;&s;ary Conditions, cannot properly be called Mi|racles; but tho&s;e done by our Saviour I have abundantly proved to have the&s;e three Conditions, and con&s;equently were true Miracles.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. If you will not believe the Wonders or Miracles that were done by the Pagans, at lea&s;t you will give Credit to what I my &s;elf have &s;een, <HI>viz.</HI> That our God appears in a bodily vi&s;ible Shape in our Temple; for in&s;tance, if he be an|gry with us, he appears in the form of a Lion; but if well plea&s;ed, in the &s;hape of a Bull or a Ram; in a few Hours &s;ome|times he changes his Shape, and in the

That A&s;&s;ertion of the &s;tupid Jews, That his Di&s;ciples took away his Body, will appear mo&s;t ab&s;urd, if we con|&s;ider the following Circum&s;tances of his Death and Re&s;urrection; the Jews them|&s;elves deny not Chri&s;t's Death and Burial, and that his Sepulchre was &s;trongly guard|ed by Soldiers; but they &s;ay, whil&s;t the&s;e Soldiers &s;lept, his Di&s;ciples came and &s;tole him away: But we mu&s;t think it impo&s;&s;i|ble for them to attempt &s;o bold an Action, for when our Saviour was betray'd, his Di&s;ciples were &s;truck with &s;uch fear, that they all ran away, and left their Lord in the hands of his Murtherers; even St. <HI>Peter,</HI> who was the mo&s;t forward Zealot of them all, and &s;aid, <HI>Tho' all &s;hould be offended yet
<PB N="128" REF="151">
will not I, tho' I &s;hould die with thee, yet I will not deny thee in any wi&s;e:</HI> Neverthe|le&s;s fear made St. <HI>Peter</HI> fly, and thrice de|ny his Ma&s;ter. But &s;uppo&s;ing the Di&s;ci|ples recovered from their fear and &s;urprize, and that they couragiou&s;ly attempted to take away his Body, how can we imagine the whole Company of Soldiers &s;lept at the &s;ame time, without &s;etting one vigilant Centinel? But yet granting they did all &s;leep together, how was it po&s;&s;ible the Di|&s;ciples &s;hould know at what Hour the Sol|diers were all a&s;leep? Let us &s;uppo&s;e they knew this al&s;o, how could they roll away the great Stone, enter into the Sepulchre, and take away the Body, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without ma|king noi&s;e enough to awake one Soldier? But again, &s;uppo&s;ing hitherto they did all &s;oftly and &s;ecretly, yet they mu&s;t do every thing ha&s;tily for fear of being apprehend|ed; but on the contrary, there was no Di&s;|order, no Confu&s;ion, the Grave-Cloaths in which the precious Body was wrapp'd, were decently folded up, and laid in one place, and the Napkin that was about his Head in another; which &s;hews it was done with a Pre&s;ence of Mind, and deli|berately. Granting &s;till, that the Di&s;ci|ples did carry away the Body, why did not the Jews accu&s;e them before the Ma|gi&s;trates, who certainly would have con|demn'd
<PB N="129" REF="152">

And &s;uppo&s;ing the Soldiers had &s;lept whil&s;t the Body was &s;tollen, why did not the&s;e Soldiers &s;uffer Death, according to the Laws of both Jews and <HI>Romans?</HI> La&s;tly, The A&s;&s;ertion of the Jews plainly contradicts it &s;elf; for if the Soldiers were awake, why did they not hinder the Di&s;ciples from taking away the Body? But if they were a&s;leep, how can they tell which way it was taken, or who did it? Thus you may &s;ee the Stupi|dity, Partiality, and Unbelief of the Jews, who give Credit to the Miracles of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the Prophets, for which they had on|ly Hi&s;tory and Tradition; and yet would not believe the Miracles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t of which they every Day were Eye-witne&s;&s;es.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> We mu&s;t not confound what is above Rea&s;on with that which is contrary to Rea&s;on: We now by Experience know many things which at fir&s;t &s;eem'd above our Rea&s;on. One or two fami|liar In&s;tances will make this Matter clear: Sup|po&s;e a Man born in a very cold Climate, &s;hould go into a hot Country, where the Natives never &s;aw Snow nor Ice, and &s;hould tell them, That where he was born, the Water, at a certain Sea|&s;on of the Year, was &s;o hard that a Hor&s;e can run over it; the&s;e People would &s;ay, It is a|gain&s;t Rea&s;on, and contrary to the Nature of Water to grow hard; and therefore becau&s;e nei|ther Rea&s;on nor Experience taught them other|wi&s;e, they would conclude the Traveller had a mind to impo&s;e upon them: But if the&s;e Inha|bitants were per&s;uaded he was a faithful hone&s;t Man, and &s;aid he &s;aw it with his own Eyes, and would not tell a Lye for the greate&s;t advan|tage, then certainly they would believe it upon his Te&s;timony, tho' they could not conceive how &s;uch a thing &s;hould be. Another In&s;tance is the u&s;e of the Load&s;tone; the fir&s;t that found it out was &s;urely contradicted, &s;ome perhaps believ'd him upon his Word, &s;ome doubted, and others utterly deny'd the po&s;&s;ibility of it; but Expe|rience having convinc'd us, now no Body in the&s;e Parts di&s;puteth it, tho' we cannot conceive the Rea&s;on for it; the wi&s;e&s;t Philo&s;ophers have en|quir'd into the Nature of it, but after all their Suppo&s;itions and pretended Demon&s;trations, they are forc'd to place it among&s;t <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s occult

Qualities, and to &s;ay with me it is above Rea&s;on. So we may &s;ay of the Chri&s;tian My|&s;teries: A Jew or a Gentile, who was never in|&s;tructed in this Doctrine, takes it to be ab&s;urd, again&s;t Rea&s;on, and the very Being of a God; but when they are convinc'd that Chri&s;t was the Author of it, and that he was greater than all the Prophets, the Son of God that could not impo&s;e upon us, or be impos'd upon, that he had confirm'd this Doctrine by almo&s;t an infinite number of Miracles, that God from Heaven had declar'd him to be his beloved Son, and com|manded us to hear him; I &s;ay, after we are con|vinc'd of all this, we mu&s;t then conclude it is above, but not again&s;t Rea&s;on; then we mu&s;t condemn our too great pre&s;umption, and con|fe&s;s the weakne&s;s of our Rea&s;on, which would comprehend the My&s;teries of God, and yet can|not under&s;tand a multitude of Natural Things: By the&s;e means it was, that this Holy Doctrine was propagated and prevail'd: Afterwards &s;ome Writers began to argue upon it, and &s;ome en|deavour'd to render it intelligible; but their Ex|planations are rather a di&s;&s;ervice than advantage to it. 'Tis too true this Holy Doctrine has been condemn'd by &s;ome Sects of Chri&s;tians, but that never will de&s;troy it; I am very much mi&s;taken if there be any Truth, let it be never &s;o clear and evident, but has been contradicted by &s;ome &s;ort of Men or another.</P>
<P><HI>The Author's Application.</HI></P>
<P>I don't wonder then that &s;o many Chri&s;tians deny this; for my own part I mu&s;t to my &s;hame confe&s;s, that for &s;ome time after my Conver&s;ion, I had my &s;hare of Doubts and Scruples about it; but having farther examin'd it, I have been ob|lig'd to acknowledge my weakne&s;s and ignorance,

I &s;hall not detain the Reader by ci|ting all the Texts of Holy Scripture which teach this Truth, every one has his Bible at home, and I wi&s;h they frequently may read, mark, learn, and inwardly dige&s;t what's contain'd therein.

I have brought to you are able to con|vince any thinking Man.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the great Revolutions which have happen'd in the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE find in our Chronicles, that a|bove 200 Years ago, the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> had been Govern'd for &s;ome Ages by one King, who in his Admini&s;tration depended upon the Repre&s;entatives of the People, who are two or three Men cho&s;en in every City and Village, to take care of their publick Concerns. This King whom the Natives in their Language called <HI>Ba|galo,</HI> had one Governor in each of the afore|mentioned I&s;les, &s;ubject to his Power, and accountable to him for their Admini&s;tration; and this Governour was called by the Na|tives <HI>Tano.</HI> But about 200 Years ago the Emperor of <HI>Tartary</HI> invaded this I&s;land and &s;ubdued; which continued under the Do|minion of the <HI>Tartars</HI> until the third Ge|neration:
<PB N="148" REF="171">
But the third Emperor who &s;uc|ceeded after this Conque&s;t, being an Au|&s;tere Tyranical Prince, who was very cruel to the Natives, and had formed a de&s;ign to extirpate their Religion, did &s;o provoke their natural Rage, that at la&s;t they did all with one con&s;ent take up Arms, and ro&s;e again&s;t his Deputy and the Forces by which he ruled them, and drove them all out of the Country, after a bloody Battle, And thus they &s;hook off the Yoke of <HI>Tar|tarian</HI> Bondage, under which they had groan'd above 70 Years; and re&s;tored their Natural Prince to the rightful Throne of of his Ance&s;tors, who now became inde|pendent not only of a Foreign Prince, but of all the little Commonwealths within his own Dominions; in which &s;tate they con|tinued above 70 Years. During which time the <HI>Eueopeans</HI> came thither, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who maintained a great Trade with the Natives, e&s;pecially in <HI>Great Peorko,</HI> where the <HI>Dutch</HI> built a Ca&s;tle called <HI>Tyowan.</HI> At the &s;ame time while the <HI>Dutch</HI> were there the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> came and attempted to land in the I&s;land, with a de&s;ign to Conquer it, but were &s;toutly repul&s;ed by the Natives, who took up Arms in defence of their Country, and
<PB N="149" REF="172">
maintained a War with the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> for &s;ome Years; until at la&s;t they drove them back into their own Country. And the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> finding that the <HI>Dutch</HI> under a fal&s;e pretence of joining with them to force back the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> had treacherou&s;ly under|hand a&s;&s;i&s;ted them to Conquer <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> hoping at la&s;t to wre&s;t it out of their hands and make it their own; the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were thereupon bani&s;hed, and prohibited to come any more into that I&s;land, and their Ca&s;tle <HI>Tyowan</HI> was Demoli&s;hed: Yet upon &s;ome fair Promi&s;es they were afterwards permitted again to Land there, provided they &s;hould &s;tay but a little while, and a &s;ufficient Guard &s;hould attend them and ob|&s;erve their Motions. Thither therefore they come, and when they can find what they have a mind to in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> they go no farther; but when they mi&s;s of their aim there, then they travel further into <HI>Japan, viz.</HI> to the I&s;le of <HI>Nanga&s;aque,</HI> for they are not permitted to go to any other place. However under the&s;e Commotions <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> &s;till pre&s;erved its form of Government in|dependent of a Foreign Prince, until <HI>Me|ryaandanoo</HI> fir&s;t ravi&s;hed <HI>Japan</HI> by Villany, and then conquer'd <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> by a trick, of both which Revolutions I &s;hall now give the Reader a &s;hort and true Account,
<PB N="150" REF="173">
as it is to be found in our Hi&s;tories, and is firmly believed by all the People of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> upon a con&s;tant Tradition from Father to Son, for the &s;pace of Fifty Years and up|wards.</P>
<P><HI>Meryaandanoo</HI> was by Nation a <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> but coming to <HI>Japan</HI> while he was Young, he was by the favour of &s;ome Great Man admitted to &s;ome mean Office, in the Court of the Emperor <HI>Chazadijn,</HI> where he con|tinued &s;ome time, and had his Education. But the Emperor perceiving that he was a a very Ingenious Young-Man, and well qualified for a better Office, gave him at fir&s;t &s;ome inferiour Place in the Army, in which he behaved him&s;elf &s;o well, that he was quickly preferr'd to a higher Po&s;t, and by his winning behaviour and admirable Conduct, he &s;o far in&s;innuated him&s;elf into the favour of the Emperor, that he was gradually advanced from one Po&s;t of Ho|nour in the Army to another; until at la&s;t he arrived at the highe&s;t, and was made Carilhan, or Chief General of all the Im|perial Forces, which is the highe&s;t Office in the Empire, not only for Honour, but for Power and Tru&s;t. And in the admini|&s;tration of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Office, he behaved him&s;elf with &s;o much Prudence and Courage, that the Emperor loved him exceedingly; but
<PB N="151" REF="174">
much more did he win the Heart of the Empere&s;s, who was &s;o taken with his gal|lant Mien, that &s;he could not live with|out him: So great was her kindne&s;s to him, and &s;he put &s;uch an entire confidence in his fair Speeches, that &s;he would often meet him in private places; which was a favour very rare and unu&s;ual in that Coun|try, e&s;pecially from &s;o great a Per&s;on as the Empere&s;s. Having thus gained the Love of the Emperor and Empere&s;s, to &s;o great a degree, this ungrateful Villain made u&s;e of that familiarity to which the Em|pre&s;s admitted him, and of that confidence they both put in him, fir&s;t to rai&s;e a Jea|lou&s;ie in the Mind of the Emperor again&s;t the Empere&s;s; and then by this means to contrive an opportunity for murdering them both: which Barbarous de&s;ign this Bloody Villain accompli&s;hed after this manner. Fir&s;t, he per&s;waded the Emperor that his Empere&s;s was in Love with a certain Noble|man, whom he &s;uppo&s;ed, and &s;he often met him, and had private conver&s;ation with him in the Garden: Whereupon the Em|peror being highly enrag'd both again&s;t this Nobleman, whom he fal&s;ly accu&s;ed, and a|gain&s;t the Empere&s;s, who was &s;uppos'd to have kept company with him, de&s;ired <HI>Meryaan|danoo</HI> to enquire diligently at what Hour,
<PB N="152" REF="175">
and in what place they were to meet toge|ther in the Garden, if it were po&s;&s;ible for him to find it out; and then &s;ays he, come and acquaint me with it, and I will take care that neither of them &s;hall e&s;cape out of my hands, until they have both &s;uffer'd Death, according to the demerit of their Crime. This <HI>Meryaandanoo</HI> promi&s;ed to do, as the Emperor had de&s;ired him; and &s;ometime after he came out of the Empe|ror's pre&s;ence, he went to the Apartment of the Empere&s;s, and having good a&s;&s;u|rance of her ready compliance, by his former private conver&s;ations with her, he pray'd her to meet him, at a cer|tain Hour of that Day, in a certain place of the Garden, which &s;he, mi&s;tru&s;ting no|thing, readily promi&s;ed to do, and appoint|ed the time and place for their meeting. Having gained this point, which was a great &s;tep towards fini&s;hing his de&s;ign, he went and acquainted the Emperor, that at &s;uch an Hour the Nobleman was to come, and to meet his Empere&s;s in &s;uch a place of the Garden. Whereupon the Emperor pre&s;ently commanded his Guards to be got ready, with which he intended to &s;eize them both together, and bring them to de&s;erved puni&s;hment. In the mean time <HI>Meryaandanoo</HI> having changed his Clothes,
<PB N="153" REF="176">
and mask'd his Face, that he might not be known to the Emperor, under this di&s;|gui&s;e meets the Empere&s;s at the time and place appointed, whom he mo&s;t Barbar|ou&s;ly &s;tabb'd, with a poi&s;on'd Dagger, to conceal the Murder, by &s;topping the Effu|&s;ion of Blood: The Emperor comes at fir&s;t all alone into that place of the Garden to &s;atisfie his Curio&s;ity of &s;eeing them toge|ther, fearing le&s;t the appearance of the Guards would make them run away; and he perceiv'd a certain Nobleman, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, lying upon the Empere&s;s in an un&s;eemly po&s;ture, he called for his Guards, who were at &s;ome di&s;tance from the place: But while he advanced towards the Noble|man, not knowing him to be <HI>Meryaan|danoo, Meryaandanoo</HI> was too nimble for him, who come fully prepared to execute the wicked de&s;ign he had plotted, for he had no &s;ooner called for his Guards, but he clo&s;ed in with him, and gave him his Deaths wound with the &s;ame poi&s;on'd Dagger; and immediately after he had &s;truck the blow, he fled away with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, through unbeaten Paths a|mong Trees and Bu&s;hes, and &s;o made his E&s;cape without being di&s;cover'd: When the Guards came and found the Emperor and Empere&s;s both kill'd, they &s;tood for
<PB N="154" REF="177">
&s;ome time a&s;toni&s;h'd, at this &s;trange and &s;urprizing Event; but they wonder'd mo&s;t of all at the Murder of the Emperor, who &s;o lately parted from them, and whom they heard but a little before call upon them to come to him; &s;ome condoled the &s;udden Death of two &s;uch great Per&s;ons, while others &s;earch'd every where about the Garden, among the Trees and Bu&s;hes, to find out the Murderer; But when they &s;aw that no di&s;covery could be made, the Sol|diers began to Mutiny, had not the Captain of the Guards diverted their Fury, by telling them, That they mu&s;t do nothing until they had fir&s;t acquainted the Carilhan with what had happened; whereupon a Party was immediately di&s;patch'd to his Hou&s;e, (whither he had made his E&s;cape after he had committed the Murder) and when they came there, and told him, he &s;eem'd to be mightily &s;urpris'd and troubl'd, as if he knew nothing of the matter: But to lo&s;e no time in a ca&s;e of &s;o great con&s;e|quence, he went in all ha&s;te to the place, where having viewed the dead Bodies, he evpre&s;s'd his great Sorrow, with many Sighs and Tears, for the lo&s;s of two Per|&s;ons &s;o great and &s;o good, to whom he had been infinitely obliged, and declared that this execrable Murder had been committed
<PB N="155" REF="178">
by a certain Nobleman, naming him, who had frequently kept Company with the Empere&s;s in private, and had appointed a meeting with her this very Day, as he was well a&s;&s;ur'd. This di&s;covery gave great &s;atisfaction to the Guards, who being glad of the opportunity to revenge the Death of their Ma&s;ter, went pre&s;ently and &s;truck off the Innocent Nobleman's Head, by his Order, who was the Murderer him&s;elf. <HI>Meryaandanoo</HI> having thus far &s;ucceeded in his de&s;ign, wanted now only to be de|clared Emperor, which met with &s;ome op|po&s;ition from tho&s;e in the Army, who fa|voured the Family of <HI>Chazadijn,</HI> though he had no Children by his Empere&s;s, but only by his Concubines; and for &s;ome time there were many Cabals and Facti|ons about the next Succe&s;&s;or to the Emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">e; But at la&s;t <HI>Meryaandanoo,</HI> having pre-en|gaged a great Party for him, and being generally beloved by the Soldiers, by his prevailing Intere&s;t in the Army, was cho|&s;en and declar'd Emperor of <HI>Japan</HI>; which was the finni&s;hing of the great de&s;ign he intended to accompli&s;h, by all the afore|mentioned Villainies and Cruelties.</P>
<P>About two Years after he was promo|ted to the Imperial Crown of <HI>Japan</HI> he counterfeited him&s;elf to be &s;ick, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">d

Sacrifice, told the King, that they had con&s;ulted their God, and he had con&s;ented, that they &s;hould come here to offer Sacri|fices, but he had not declar'd what &s;ucce&s;s their Oblations &s;hould have as to re&s;toring the Health of their Emperor. The King having received this An&s;wer from his Prie&s;ts, &s;ent for the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Emperor of <HI>Japan,</HI> and told them, <HI>Go and &s;alute your Emperor in my Name, and tell him, that he has leave from my God, and from me, to &s;end &s;ome of his Subjects to offer Sa|crifices to our God; and if our God &s;hall re|&s;tore his Health, I hope he will perform what he has promi&s;ed of e&s;tabli&s;hing the Wor&s;hip of our God in all his Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors having taken their leave of our King returned home, into their own Country, and acquainted the Em|peror of <HI>Japan</HI> with the An&s;wer of the King of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> to his Letter, who was very glad at the good &s;ucce&s;s of their Negoti|ation, having further de&s;igns in it than they were aware of: And therefore he pre&s;ently commanded a great Army to be made ready, and order'd the Soldiers to be put in great Litters, carried by two Ele|phants, which will hold Thirty, or Forty Men; and to prevent any &s;u&s;picion of the the <HI>Formo&s;ans,</HI> they placed Ox|en or Rams to be &s;een at the Windows
<PB N="159" REF="182">
of the Litters. Thus he covertly convey'd a numerous Army into the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> with many of the Nobility of his Court, under the Religious pretence of Offering Sacrifice for the Recovery of his Health, but really with a de&s;ign to Conquer the Country. The numerous Chariots were divided into three parts, the greate&s;t of which was &s;ent into the Capital City <HI>Xter|net&s;a,</HI> and the two other parts into two o|ther Cities, called <HI>Bigno</HI> and <HI>Khadzey</HI>; And at a certain Hour appointed the Chariots were opened in all the three Cities, the Soldiers came out, and with Sword in Hand, threatning pre&s;ent Death to the King, and all the Inhabitants of the City <HI>Xternet&s;a</HI> (which was likewi&s;e done in the other Cities at the &s;ame time) unle&s;s they would &s;ubmit them&s;elves to be governed by the Emperor of <HI>Japan.</HI> The King con|&s;idering that he had no other pro&s;pect but that of imminent and unavoidable Death before him, and that there was no hopes by his Death to pre&s;erve the Ancient Liberties of his Country, cho&s;e rather to &s;ubmit to the fatal nece&s;&s;ity he was under, than throw away his Life to no purpo&s;e; and the re&s;t of the Inhabitants every where fol|low'd his example in this &s;urpri&s;ing danger of Death, &s;o that the whole Kingdom was quickly reduc'd under the Yoke of the Em|peror
<PB N="160" REF="183">
of <HI>Japan,</HI> without the Effu&s;ion of much Blood. And from that time the Em|peror of <HI>Japan</HI> &s;ends a King into the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> who is called <HI>Tano Angon,</HI> or the &s;uperintendent King: But he who was King before, in that I&s;le, is only as a <HI>Baga|landro</HI> or Viceroy, or one that is next to the King in Dignity without any Power. And this is a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of the manner how the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> was &s;ubdued by the Villany of the Emperor <HI>Meryaandanoo,</HI> who in&s;tead of Sacrificing Bea&s;ts to the God of the Country, as he pretended, would have Sacrificed the Inhabitants to his own Am|bition, if they had not prevented him by a voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Rule and Go|vernment. I &s;hall therefore in the next place give an account of the Form of Go|vernment in this I&s;le, which is now almo&s;t the &s;ame with that which is in the other I&s;les of <HI>Japan.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the Form of Government in the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> and of the New Laws made by the Emperor <HI>Meryaan|danoo.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>MEryaandanoo</HI> being thus &s;ettled Em|peror of <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> made new Laws relating to the Deputy King, and enforced the old Laws relating to the Sub|jects, with grievous Penalties, as will ap|pear hereafter.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Law is, Concerning the Kings that are &s;ubject to him, who are Twenty Five in number (be&s;ides the Eight who are not properly called <HI>Angons</HI> or <HI>Bagalos</HI> but <HI>Viceroys</HI> or <HI>Bagelanders</HI>) And the&s;e Kings are oblieged, by this Law, twice in a Year to wait upon the Emperor, and then every one of them is to give an account of his Admini&s;tration of the Government, and of all the Notable Occurrences which have happened in his Kingdom for the &s;pace of half a Year, and to receive the new Com|mands of the Emperor, if he &s;hall think fit to give any.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="185">The Second Law is, That none of them &s;hall tran&s;gre&s;s the Commands of the Em|peror, unle&s;s he fir&s;t acquaints him with the nece&s;&s;ity that forces him to do it; yet in a ca&s;e of urgent nece&s;&s;ity, this Law is moderated by Equity.</P>
<P>The Third Law is, That they &s;hall do nothing to the detriment of the People, &s;ub|ject to their Government; That they &s;hall not be unju&s;t, or cruel to them, or any ways prejudice them in their Life, Fortune, or Re|putation, without a ju&s;t cau&s;e: which Law he mde to gain the Love of the People.</P>
<P>The Fourth is, That none of the Kings &s;hall &s;uffer a Chri&s;tian to live in his Coun|try, but every one of them &s;hall keep Sear|chers, or Centinels in the &s;everal Sea Ports, who &s;hall Try all Foreigners, as &s;oon as they arrive in the Harbour whether they be Chri&s;tians or no, by this Te&s;t, of trampling upon the Crucifix; which Te&s;t was chiefly de&s;ign'd again&s;t the Papi&s;ts, who wor&s;hip the Crucifix, and therefore dare not trample upon it: But as to other Foreigners who do trample upon the Crucifix, the Governour is to grant them a Pa&s;s to Travel through all the Cities un|der his Dominion, provided they are not above Twenty in number.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is, That no King can prohibit or enjoin any Religion, in his Country, but every &s;ubject &s;hall enjoy the Liberty of
<PB N="163" REF="186">
his Con&s;cience to wor&s;hip his God after his own way, except there &s;hall be any found that are Chri&s;tians; for the di&s;covery of whom there &s;hall be Searchers appoint|ed in all Cities and Villages, who &s;hall try them by the Te&s;t aforementioned. And to all the&s;e Laws this Sanction is added, That if any Per&s;on &s;hall violate any one of the&s;e Laws they &s;hall pre&s;ently be put to Death, which is the true Rea&s;on, why the Com|mands of the Emperor are every where &s;o exactly obey'd.</P>
<P>He made no new Laws relating to the Subjects, but only revived the Natural and Ancient Laws, which he enforced with new Penalties proportionable to the Crimes.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t is again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, That if any Foreigner &s;hall be found who is a Chri&s;tian, and who hath &s;educ'd or endea|voured to &s;educe the Inhabitants to Chri|&s;tianity, he &s;hall be impri&s;on'd, together with all tho&s;e whom he hath &s;educed. And if he will Renounce the Chri&s;tian Faith, and wor&s;hip Idols, he &s;hall not only be pardon'd, but have a certain Pen&s;ion al|lowed him for his Sub&s;i&s;tence; but if he refu&s;e to do this, he &s;hall be burnt alive; And as to tho&s;e who have been &s;educ'd, if they will return to their former Idolatry, they &s;hall be &s;et at liberty; but if they will not, they &s;hall be hang'd.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="187">The Second is again&s;t Murderers, Thieves and Robbers, <HI>viz.</HI> Who&s;oever &s;hall kill another Man unju&s;tly, &s;hall be hang'd up by the Feet with his head downward, and after this manner &s;hall hang alive a longer or &s;horter time, according to the aggravation of his Crime, until he be Shot to Death with Arrows: But if he be both a Robber and a Murderer he &s;hall be Crucified. A Thief &s;hall be puni&s;hed according to the heinou&s;ne&s;s of his Crime, either with Hang|ing, or continual Impri&s;onment, or with Whipping, or a Fine.</P>
<P>The Third Law is again&s;t Adulterers, <HI>viz.</HI> They &s;hall for the fir&s;t Offence pay a Fine of 100 <HI>Copans</HI> (each <HI>Copan</HI> being a piece of Gold weighing a Pound) and tho&s;e who have not Money to pay &s;uch a Fine, they &s;hall be publickly Whipt by the Hand of the Hangman: But if any Per&s;on be guilty of the &s;ame Crime a &s;econd time, he or &s;he &s;hall be beheaded. For though, as will appear in the following Chapter a|bout Religion, every Man may have as many Wives, as his E&s;tate is able to main|tain; yet if any Man &s;hall carnally know another Woman be&s;ides his own Wives, to whom he has promi&s;ed Fidelity, he is guilty of Adultery. The &s;ame Law ob|liges all tho&s;e who are unmarried provi|ded they be Natives of the Country: But
<PB N="165" REF="188">
this Law does not extend to Foreigners, to whom the Natives are wont to offer Virgins or Whores, to be made u&s;e of at their Plea|&s;ure, with Impunity.</P>
<P>But here I mu&s;t de&s;ire the Reader to ob|&s;erve, that the Husband has &s;uch full power over his Wife, that if he apprehend her in the act of Adultery; he may puni&s;h her after what manner, and to what degree he plea&s;es, even unto Death: But if the thing be not commonly known, he may &s;pare her, if he thinks fit, upon her promi&s;e of amendment for the future.</P>
<P>The Fourth Law is, Who&s;oever &s;hall Suborn fal&s;e Witne&s;s again&s;t any Man, both he and the fal&s;e Witne&s;&s;es &s;hall have their Tongue cut out, and be further puni&s;h'd according to the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Crime, and the damage done to the Party, again&s;t whom they te&s;tified.</P>
<P>The Fifth Law is, Who&s;oever &s;hall bal&s;|pheme the God of the Country he &s;hall be burnt alive.</P>
<P>The Sixth is, If a Son or a Daughter &s;hall &s;trike their Father or Mother, or one of their Kindred that is Ancient, or one that is &s;uperiour to them in Power, their Arms and Legs &s;hall be cut off, and a Stone be|ing tied about their Neck, they &s;hall be thrown into the Sea, or a River. But if any one &s;hall &s;trike a Prie&s;t, their Arms &s;hall
<PB N="166" REF="189">
be burnt off, and then their Body &s;hall be buried alive.</P>
<P>Who&s;oever &s;hall &s;trike his King, Inten|dant or Governour, &s;hall be hang'd up by the Feet till he die, having four Dogs fa&s;ten'd to his Body to tear it in pieces.</P>
<P>The Seventh is, Who&s;oever &s;hall Re|proach or Slander any Man, &s;hall have his Tongue bored through with a hot Iron: But who&s;oever refu&s;es to obey his Superiour in things Lawful, &s;hall be beheaded.</P>
<P>The Eighth is, Who&s;oever &s;hall Plot any Trea&s;on again&s;t the Emperor, or any of the Kings, or &s;hall endeavour the Subver|&s;ion of the Religion e&s;tabli&s;h'd, he &s;hall be tortur'd with all imaginable Torments.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Laws <HI>Meryaandanoo</HI> made, or revived in the fourth Year of his Empire, at a meeting of all the Kings of his Empire, and of all the chief Prie&s;ts of every City: And by verture of them, all the Inhabi|tants enjoy a profound Peace; for as the Subjects do readily obey the Laws relating to them&s;elves, &s;o the Governours and Of|ficers are careful to put them in Execution whenever there is occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This is what I chiefly intended in this Chapter, to give an account of the Laws and their Sanctions, by which <HI>Meryaandanoo</HI> governs his Deputy-Kings and their Sub|jects; and though there are other things
<PB N="167" REF="190">
which might be placed here under this head of Government, yet becau&s;e they are here|after to be in&s;erted in their proper places, they are here omitted.</P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Religion of the <HI>Formo&s;ans.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SInce my de&s;ign is only to give an ac|count of the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> I &s;hall briefly mention but three kinds of Religion that are ob&s;erved in <HI>Japan,</HI> becau&s;e of the Af|finity &s;ome of them have with that which is e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The Fir&s;t kind of Religion is Idolatry, or the Wor&s;hip of Idols: And this kind of Wor&s;hip mo&s;t generally prevails above all others in <HI>Japan,</HI> &s;o that in one Temple call'd <HI>Amida,</HI> in the Capital City of <HI>Meaco,</HI> there are no fewer than 3500 Idols; whereof 1000 are of Gold, 1000 of Silver, and 1000 of Bra&s;s, and 500 of Wood and Stone, and to the&s;e Idols they Sacrifice Oxen, Rams, Goats, and &s;uch like Bea&s;ts, and &s;ometimes they Sacrifice Infants to them, when their God is not ap|pea&s;ed by other Sacrifices.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="191">The &s;econd kind of Religion is that of tho&s;e who acknowledge one God, whom they believe to be &s;o Sublime and Great, that they dare not Sacrifice to him; and therefore they have e&s;tabli&s;h'd the Sun as the great Power of God which Rules and Governs the World, and the Moon and Stars as powers inferior to the Sun, which more exactly in&s;pect and take care of Terre&s;trial affairs: Wherefore they Sa|crifice Infants to the Sun, and Bea&s;ts to the Moon and Stars.</P>
<P>The Third &s;ort is rather a Sect of Athei&s;m than Religion, for they deny the being of God, and affirm that the World was from Eternity and &s;hall continue to Eternity. Hence &s;ome of them think rhat the Soul is Mortal and dies with the Body, like that of Bea&s;ts; but others of them &s;ay that the Soul is not Mortal, but informs another Body after Death, and &s;o it pa&s;&s;es out of one Body into another to Eternity. When|&s;oever the Soul has done well, they think it pa&s;&s;es into the Body of a Rich man who lives in great ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, but if it has done evil it pa&s;&s;es into the Body of &s;ome poor Wretch to &s;uffer Pain and Mi&s;ery; and &s;o the Soul is liable to endle&s;s Vici&s;&s;i|tudes of Vertue and Vice, of plea&s;ure and Pain. The&s;e Athei&s;ts u&s;e no Religious Wor&s;hip, &s;aving that they all offer Sacrifice
<PB N="169" REF="192">
to evil Spirits or Devils, that they may not hurt them. But the Tran&s;migration of Souls, is believ'd not only by them but by all the <HI>Jappanne&s;e,</HI> except tho&s;e who think that the Soul is Mortal.</P>
<P>But my bu&s;ine&s;s is not to give a particular account of their &s;everal opinions, and dif|ferent ways of Wor&s;hip, and therefore I have noted the&s;e things only <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant</HI> to &s;how wherein they agree, and wherein they differ from the Religion e&s;tabli&s;h'd in <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>The Religion of the <HI>Forma&s;ans</HI> was re|veal'd by their God, if we may believe their <HI>Jarhabadiond (i. e.</HI> the Election of the Land) which makes mention of the Re|velation upon which they found the Reli|gious Wor&s;hip now us'd among them, and gives the following account of it: That about 900 Years ago, the Inhabitants of <HI>For|mo&s;a</HI> knew no other Gods but the Sun and the Moon, whom they believed to be Supreme, and the Stars, which they looked upon to be as it were <HI>Semidei,</HI> or Subordi|nate Gods; and then their whole Wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ted in adoring them Morning and Evening, and offering them the Sacrifices of Bea&s;ts, But after &s;ome time there a|ro&s;e two Philo&s;ophers, who had led a Pious and Au&s;tere kind of Life in the De|&s;erts, and pretended that God had appear'd to them, and &s;poke to them, to this purpo&s;e; <HI>I am much Troubled for the Blindne&s;s of
<PB N="170" REF="193">
this People becau&s;e they Wor&s;hip the Sun, Moon and Stars &s;o devoutly, as the Supreme Deity; go and tell them, I am the Lord of the Sun, Moon and Stars, of the Heaven, the Earth, the Sea and all things that are in them, I Govern the Creatures by the Sun and Moon and the</HI> 10 <HI>Stars, and without me they cannot exi&s;t: Go and tell them, that God has ap|pear'd to you, and &s;aid, if they will wor&s;hip and adore him, he will be their Protector, and will appear to them in the Churches, which they Build to his honour, and promi&s;e them in my Name, that if they Wor&s;hip and obay me, they &s;hall receive great rewards after this Life.</HI> The Names of the&s;e two Philo&s;ophers, were <HI>Zeroaboabel,</HI> which is a Name unknown to to the <HI>Japanne&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Chorhe Mathcin,</HI> which in the <HI>Japan</HI> Language &s;ignifies Creator <HI>Annunciat,</HI> for <HI>Chorhe</HI> &s;ignifies the Creator, and <HI>Mathcin</HI> declares. Now the&s;e two preten|ding that God had &s;poke to them, came to a certain Mountain call'd <HI>Tanalio</HI> near the Capital City, where the People were met together to offer Sacrifice to the Sun, and told them to this Effect. <HI>O ye Blind Mor|tals, who Wor&s;hip the Stars &s;o devoutly, and are ignorant of the God who is above them; that God who Created the Sun and Moon, and all things in Heaven and Earth, has this day taken pity on you, and appeared to us, and com|manded us to declare him unto you:</HI> And
<PB N="171" REF="194">
after they had &s;aid this, they Demon&s;trated by many Arguments, that there is one Su|preme God, who is above all the vi&s;ible things in this World. This di&s;cour&s;e &s;o much affected the People, that they de&s;ired to know of them, how that God would be Wor&s;hiped, whether they &s;hould Wor&s;hip him after the &s;ame manner, as they now Wor&s;hiped the Sun. To which they an|&s;wered, no. <HI>But if they would Wor&s;hip him according to his mind, in an acceptable manner, they &s;hould fir&s;t Build him a Temple, and in that they &s;hould make a Tabernacle, and an Altar, and upon the Altar they &s;hould Burn</HI> 20000 <HI>Hearts of young Children, under</HI> 9 <HI>Years of Age. And when ye have done the&s;e things,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>then God will appear to you in this Tabernacle, and tell you what you are to do further for his Service.</HI> When the Peo|ple heard the&s;e things, they could no longer refrain them&s;elves, but exclaimed again&s;t the&s;e two Prophets as Hypocrites and Im|po&s;tors; and asked them in great rage, how can your God be &s;o Cruel as to require us to kill &s;o many of our Sons, and offer them up in Sacrifice to him: Whereupon the two Prophets fled away into the De&s;ert again, having left the&s;e Threatning words behind them, <HI>We have told you what our God Commanded us to &s;ay unto you; but if ye will not believe our words, and obey
<PB N="172" REF="195">
his will, ye &s;hall quickly find, that the Divine Vengeance will pur&s;ue you.</HI></P>
<P>A little while after it was ob&s;erv'd, that the Sky was Darkned, there fell much Rain with Hail, which de&s;troyed the Fruits of the Ground, innumerable claps of Thunder were heard in the Air, there were great Earth quakes in &s;everal places, and the Air became &s;o Pe&s;tilential, that the greate&s;t part of the Inhabitants were vi&s;i&s;ted with the Plague, the wild Bea&s;ts came into their Cities, and even into their Hou&s;es, and de|voured their young Children: And the&s;e Calamities la&s;ted for a day and a half, which were &s;o Terrible, that the whole I&s;land &s;eemed to be in danger of utter Ruin and De&s;truction, Which &s;ad Pro&s;pect moved all the Inhabitants to return Unanimou&s;ly to the Mountain afore&s;aid, and there they confe&s;&s;ed their great fault in refu&s;ing to be|lieve the two Prophets, and cry'd earne&s;tly with all their Hearts to that God, who had &s;poken to them by tho&s;e Prophets, de|precating his Wrath for their pa&s;t Offences, and Promi&s;ing they would do what&s;oever he &s;hould command them if he would now &s;pare them.

The fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e Days &s;hall be ob&s;erv'd by ri&s;ing early in the Morn|ing and Adoring, and after ye have wor|&s;hipp'd, ye &s;hall come into the Temple, and Pray and Sing Hymns from One a Clock until Two: At Two a Clock ye &s;hall go to a Fountain or River without the City, and there ye &s;hall throw Water upon your Head twelve Times, and then ye &s;hall re|turn into the Temple, ye &s;hall go and re|turn all together, and while ye are on the way which &s;hall take up the &s;pace of an Hour in going and returning, ye &s;hall be all the while Praying.

The time of &s;laying and offering the Sacri|fices &s;hall la&s;t for three Hours, <HI>viz.</HI> from three a Clock till Six, and at Six there &s;hall be a Sermon, or an Explication of the fir&s;t Principles of Religion, and then a Thank&s;|giving, which being ended, ye &s;hall return Home, and continue there Eating and Drinking until the &s;econd Hour: After which ye &s;hall return to the Temple again, and continue there until the &s;ixth Hour, Praying and Singing, with the In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick playing; and then there &s;hall be again a Lecture upon the Catechetical Do|ctrins, which being ended, ye &s;hall return Home and recreate your &s;elves with any lawful Diver&s;ions.</P>

<P>Ye &s;hall call the fir&s;t and la&s;t Day of the Fe&s;tival a double Fea&s;t, and the other Days &s;imple Fea&s;ts.

<P>Note, That a Fe&s;tival is therefore call'd double, becau&s;e the People go twice to the Temple on that Day, and it is call'd &s;imple becau&s;e they go but once.</P>
<P>And further it is to be noted, that in&s;tead of our Clocks and Watches, they mea&s;ure Time by an In&s;trument made of Wood, in the form of our Hour Gla&s;s, which being fill'd with Sand, runs all out in the &s;pace of an Hour: And this being ob&s;erv'd by cer|tain Watchmen appointed on purpo&s;e for that end, as &s;oon as the Sand is run out, they beat a Drum, and give notice what Hour it is, which is the Cu&s;tom us'd in all Cities, but the Country People judge as ex|actly as they can what Hour it is by the Sun Moon or Stars.</P>

in the mean time joyning in their Hearts with the Words of the Prie&s;t. After the Thank&s;giving the People ri&s;e up, and &s;ome Hymns made by the Chief Prie&s;ts are &s;ung, the Flute and Tymbrel and other In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick playing all the while: Then the Prie&s;ts begin to pray for the Sanctification of the Victims, and after that they &s;lay them and receive the Blood into a Copper; they divide the Fle&s;h into Pieces, and then Boil it with the Blood in a Chaldron which is upon the Altar; while the Fle&s;h is a Boil|ing, the Chief Prie&s;t Prays to God, that he would be pleas'd to accept of the&s;e Sacrifices for the Remi&s;&s;ion of the Sins of the People: And after the Fle&s;h is Boil'd, the People draw near before the Altar, and every one of them receives a piece of it from the Hand of the Prie&s;t, bowing down his Head when he takes it, and all this time the re&s;t are Sing|ing, and the In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick play|ing. After the&s;e Ceremonies are ended, a Prie&s;t goes up to a Place higher than the Seats of the People, and there he Preaches and in&s;tructs the People, who ask him Que&s;tions, and he an&s;wers them. At la&s;t Thanks are return'd, and Prayers are made for all Things nece&s;&s;ary, and then all the People go Home to Dinner, where they are to continue only for the &s;pace of two Hours, which is all the time allow'd them between

Morning and Evening Service, during which time they mu&s;t not indulge them|&s;elves to exce&s;s, or do any thing that's un|lawful, but behave them&s;elves very mode&s;t|ly; and then they return to the Temple, where the &s;ame Ceremonies are us'd as were in the Morning, except the Sacrifices; and the Service being ended they go to their own Hou&s;es, and after Supper they may Walk, Play, or u&s;e any other lawful Re|creation; but they mu&s;t not do any &s;ervile Work on that Day.</P>
<P>Simple Fe&s;tivals are celebrated after the &s;ame manner as the Ve&s;pers of the double Fe&s;tivals.</P>
<P>It is further to be remark'd, That on Fe|&s;tival Days, after the Sacrifice is ended, and the Tabernacle in which their God dwells is open'd, when God appears in the form of a Lyon, or a Bear, or &s;ome other fierce Bea&s;t, that then God is thought to be Angry with the People: And therefore in &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Tabernacle is to be &s;hut up again, and new Sacrifices of Bea&s;ts are to be offer'd, until God &s;hall appear in ano|ther Shape, <HI>viz.</HI> of an Ox, a Calf, a Lamb, or &s;uch like Bea&s;ts: And if the&s;e Sacrifices of Bea&s;ts are not &s;ufficient to change the angry God into another &s;hape, then Infants are to be offer'd in Sacrifice unto him, un|til &s;uch time as, their God appearing in ano|ther

form, &s;hows him&s;elf to be pacified and reconcil'd unto the People: And if at any time he appears in the form of an Elephant, then we hope that he will do great Things for us.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts are to prepare them&s;elves by Fa&s;ting and Prayer, before they pre&s;ume to &s;peak to God in &s;ecret, and after they have been with him, they declare to the People what he &s;ays.</P>
<P>'Tis yet further to be noted, That their God always a&s;&s;umes the &s;hape of a ma&s;cu|line Creature, and never of a Female, from whence they have been induc'd to believe, that a Woman is &s;o impure, that &s;he can never attain to Happine&s;s, until &s;he be Transform'd into the Body either of a Man, or &s;ome Male Bea&s;t.</P>

The Office of the&s;e Regulars, is to in&s;truct the Youth in the Principles of their Religion, to teach them to Read and Write, and what&s;oever el&s;e may conduce to their Edification. Be&s;ides, the&s;e Regulars are oblig'd to lead Religi|ous Lives, and to Cloath them&s;elves in di&s;tingui&s;hing Habits; they are to &s;have their Head, but not to cut their Beard&punc; They are to wear a Gown that does not open before or behind, and a Hood upo their Heads: And la&s;tly, they may retire from the World, and live in de&s;ert Places, if they think fit to choo&s;e &s;uch an au&s;tere kind of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="211">As their God had Commanded, &s;o did <HI>P&s;almanaazaar.</HI> He created one ancient Philo&s;opher of the Royal Progeny High-prie&s;t, to whom he gave the power of or|daining all the other inferior Prie&s;ts: This High-prie&s;t therefore cho&s;e three out of the Citizens of every City, whom he ordain'd Prie&s;ts, and one in every Village, until &s;uch time as Temples were every where built: And then the number of Prie&s;ts was more encreas'd, in&s;omuch that in the City <HI>Xter|net&s;a</HI> the number grew at la&s;t to 160, and was proportionably augmented in other places, whether Cities or Villages. <HI>P&s;al|manaazaar</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd al&s;o a Mona&s;tery in <HI>Xternet&s;a,</HI> and in many other Cities, in which the Regulars were to live according to the Rules abovemention'd, which were pre&s;crib'd by their God. La&s;tly he gave order, That this High-prie&s;t &s;hould ordain in every City one Prie&s;t, who might ordain others; and he was call'd the Chief Sacri|ficator, and has the power to ordain other &s;ubordinate Prie&s;ts and Sacrificators. The&s;e are the Rites and Ceremonies deliver'd to the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> from their God, by his Pro|phet <HI>P&s;almanaazaar,</HI> which have been ever &s;ince ob&s;erved in their Country.</P>
<P>Now the Names of all the &s;everal kinds of Prie&s;ts in our Language are the&s;e: The High prie&s;t is call'd <HI>Gnotoy Bonzo,</HI> the

<P>The Office of the High-prie&s;t is to ordain others, to &s;peak to God in private, and de|clare his Will to all the other Prie&s;ts, and to cha&s;ti&s;e tho&s;e who do not faithfully di&s;|charge their Office.</P>
<P>The Office of the Chief-Sacrificator is to ordain other Prie&s;ts within his own Precinct, which is as it were his Dioce&s;e, to rule over them, and to take care of the Sacrifices, but chiefly of the Infants that are to be Sacri|fic'd; for which end he is to take an ac|compt how many Boys each Family can furni&s;h, and to admoni&s;h them in time to &s;end in their number.</P>
<P>Moreover he alone is to cut the Throats of the Infants, and pluck out their Hearts; others are to lay them upon the Gridiron, but he is to Pray publickly all the time they are a Burning.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="213">The Office of the Subordinate Sacrfica|tors, is to &s;lay the Bea&s;ts, to wa&s;h and Boil them, and di&s;tribute pieces of their Fle&s;h to the People; and &s;ome of them are oblig'd to pray with the High-prie&s;t all the time that the&s;e things are a doing.</P>
<P>The Office of the &s;ecular Prie&s;ts is vari|ous, for &s;ome of them are Readers, others Preachers, or In&s;tructors of Youth, and others of them look after the Temple and Tabernacle, to &s;ee that all the Uten&s;ils be|longing to them be kept in good Order.</P>
<P>The regular Prie&s;ts, as I have already told you, u&s;e to in&s;truct Youth, and to Preach; but moreover they &s;hould live re|tir'd from the World, pre&s;erve Cha&s;tity, and continue in Celibacy; they &s;hould &s;ub|mit them&s;elves to their &s;uperiors, fa&s;t once a Week, and by all means improve in Ver|tue. But if once they be debauch'd, they do no longer ob&s;erve the Rule deliver'd as they believe, by their God, and their Ance|&s;tors.</P>
<P>And here it is to be noted, That the&s;e Regulars do not make &s;uch Vows as the Popi&s;h Monks do; for they only take the Vow of Celibacy, neither do they Vow That &s;o ab&s;olutely, but that they are &s;till left at liberty, if they find that they cannot re|frain from Women, to leave the Mona&s;te|ry, and then to marry a Wife: But they
<PB N="189" REF="214">
make no Vows of a blind obedience to their Superiors, of an affected poverty, and Humility, and of renouncing the Riches of this World. The only general Law of the&s;e Societies is this, who&s;oever finds him&s;elf fit and di&s;po&s;ed to embrace a retir'd kind of Life, provided he be Pious, Learned and &s;incere, whether he be Rich or Poor, is to be admitted into a Convent, and when he enters, he is to bring with him that part of his Fathers E&s;tate that belongs to him, and add it to the Revenues of the Convent. But if he be oblig'd, out of a de&s;ire of Marrying, to leave it, then all the Goods he brought with him into the Convent are re&s;tor'd to him, and nece&s;&s;ary Food and Raiment are <HI>gratis</HI> given him, while he continued in it. But if he require any thing extraordinary, over and above the common allowance of the Convent, as &s;ome do, then this is to be Furni&s;hed at his own proper Charge, yet he is never permit|ted to go out of the bounds of the Convent, until he leave it for good and all. If any one die in the Convent, he is to leave all his Goods to it, and while he lives in it, he is to obey his Superior in all things which concern their Rules, but no further: For if any Su|perior &s;hould command one of the Regulars to Eat only Roots, while others fare Deli|ciou&s;ly,
<PB N="190" REF="215">
he may refu&s;e to obey him: But this is a Ca&s;e that has never happen'd.</P>
<P>Thus all Religious Rites and Ceremonies, are Admini&s;tred by one High-prie&s;t, by &s;ome Sacrificators, and &s;ome that are Subordi|nate to them, and by Regular and Secular Prie&s;ts. But becau&s;e all that has been hi|therto &s;aid, relates only to the Wor&s;hip of their God, we &s;hall now add &s;omething con|cerning the way of Wor&s;hipping the Sun, Moon and Stars, which are their Ancient Vi&s;ible Deities.</P>

And in the night time, at the fir&s;t hour ye &s;hall Wor&s;hip the Moon and the other five Stars, after the &s;ame manner. For ye mu&s;t know that the Sun is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ex|cellent Creature, which I have Created to govern you, and to him I have given power of conferring Benefits upon you, according as you de&s;erve well of me and him.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of the Po&s;tures of the Body in Adoring.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> in Adoring God, u&s;e various Po&s;tures of Body according to the &s;everal Parts of Religious Wor&s;hip they are performing: For 1&s;t, When the <HI>Jarha|badiond</HI> is publickly read in their Temples, every one of them, at lea&s;t if he be capa|ble of doing it, bends a little the right Knee, and lifts up the right Hand towards Heaven. 2. When Thanks are given to God, then all of them fall pro&s;trate on the Ground. 3. After the Thank&s;giving, when they Sing Songs or Hymns, they are to &s;tand up with their Hands joyn'd together. 4. When Prayers are made for the Sanctification of the Sacrifices, then every one bends the left Knee, and &s;tretches out his Arms wide open. But when the <HI>Victims</HI> are a &s;laying, every one may &s;it upon the ground (for they have no Seats or Pews, &s;uch as you u&s;e here in <HI>England</HI>) only the Richer &s;ort have a Cu|&s;hion to &s;it on; while the Fle&s;h is a boyling, every one &s;tands with his Hands joyn'd to|gether, looking towards the upper Part of the Tabernacle. After the Fle&s;h is boyl'd,
<PB N="196" REF="222">
every one of the People takes a piece of the Fle&s;h from the Prie&s;t and eats it, and what remains, the Prie&s;ts keep for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When all the&s;e Ceremonies are ended, the Tabernacle is opened, and then every one for &s;ometime lies pro&s;trate on the ground to adore; and after they ri&s;e up, they may look upon their God, and if he appears in the &s;hape of an Ox, or &s;uch-like tame Bea&s;t, then they leap for Joy, becau&s;e they believe that God is well-pleas'd with them: But if he appears in the &s;hape of a Lyon, then they think &s;ome Great Crime has been commit|ted, whereby God is much offended, and therefore they endeavour by New Sacrifices to appea&s;e him. After the Tabernacle is open'd and every one has ador'd, then there is a Sermon, and while that la&s;ts, the People &s;tand; and after Sermon, there is a &s;hort Prayer, and then a Than&s;giving; after which the people bow down their Body, and touch the ground with the fore-finger of their right Hand, and then depart.</P>
<P>When the Sun, Moon and Stars, are ador'd upon the Mountain, then they bend the right Knee, and hold up the right Hand toward Heaven; when that Chapter of <HI>Jar|habadiond</HI> is read, wherein our God com|mands them to Wor&s;hip, the &s;ame po&s;ture of Body is ob&s;erv'd in their Songs and Hymns, they &s;tand with their Hands joyn'd
<PB N="197" REF="223">
together. In their Prayers they bend the left Knee and &s;tretch out their Arms. At their Than&s;giving the People &s;tand, looking to|wards Heaven with their Arms extended and wide open; and the &s;ame po&s;ture they u&s;e on their common Days, when they wor|&s;hip the Sun and the 5 Stars; but at Night when they wor&s;hip the Moon and the 5 Stars, they &s;tand with their Hands joyn'd together. And this is all that is remarkable, as to the &s;everal po&s;tures of Body they u&s;e in their Religious Wor&s;hip.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the Ceremonies that are ob&s;erv'd at the Birth of Children.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Command of our God, the fol|lowing Ceremonies are ob&s;erv'd at the Birth of Children. 1&s;t, When the Mother feels the time of Birth approaching, &s;he ought to offer Sacrifices to the 10 Stars, more or le&s;s precious according to her Ability. After &s;he is brought to Bed of a Child, &s;he is to keep the Infant until the 1&s;t Day of the Week, and on that Day &s;he is to wa&s;h her
<PB N="198" REF="224">
&s;elf and the Infant, and go unto the Tem|ple with her Husband, and to carry the In|fant with her, and there to offer a Sacrifice to our God. Then Prayers are made for the Infant, and thanks are return'd for her &s;afe delivery: Then the Mother and Father do &s;olemnly promi&s;e, that they &s;hall be rea|dy to deliver up the Child, (if it be a Son and not the fir&s;t-born) to be Sacrific'd to the Honour of God, when&s;oever it &s;hall be call'd for. Then a &s;mall fire being kindled of &s;traw, the chief Sacrificator takes the Child, and makes it pa&s;s through the flame 12 times; after which there comes another Prie&s;t, and anoints the Child's skin with Oyl, lea&s;t it &s;hould &s;uffer any prejudice by the flame. All the&s;e things being ended, the Mother takes the Child, and the Prie&s;t hav|ing read the Thank&s;giving, &s;he returns Home with it; where it is u&s;ual upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, for the Father and Mother to make an Entertainment for their Kindred, Friends, and &s;ome of the Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the Child arrives at 9 Years of Age, then the Child is to go on a Fe&s;tival Day unto the Temple with its Father and Mother, and there to make a Vow unto God, that &s;ince he was pleas'd not to de&s;ire him for a Sacrifice, he will faithfully ob&s;erve what&s;oever is commanded him in <HI>Jarhaba|diond:</HI> And the Father and Mother do pro|mi&s;e
<PB N="199" REF="225">
on their part, that they will do what|ever lies in their Power for the Honour of our God. And then the Prie&s;t reads a Prayer and Than&s;giving, and they all return Home. The 1&s;t Ceremony is call'd <HI>Abda|lain,</HI> or the Purification; the 2d is call'd <HI>Blado,</HI> or the Vow.</P>
<P>But here it is to be Noted, that tho we u&s;e this Ceremony of Purification, yet we do it not upon the account of any Original Sin in the Infant, which we are altogether Ignorant of: And yet becau&s;e our God has commanded this Purification to be us'd, &s;ome of them believe that it is for the Corruption of our Nature; and others that it is for the Sins of our Ance&s;tors, and chiefly of our Father and Mother: For we think that God Created this World in time, and re|pleni&s;h'd it with Men; but we believe that God did not Create Mankind in the &s;ame Corrupt State in which it now is, but that Men by degrees Corrupted them&s;elves, and that they do daily more and more degene|rate from their Primitive State, as we find too plainly by experience. This is no Arti|cle of our Faith, but only the Opinion of &s;ome concerning the Creation of the World, and the State of the 1&s;t Men Created by God: But our Scripture makes no menti|on of the&s;e things.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of our Marriage, or <HI>Groutacho.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Since our God requires the Hearts of &s;o many young Boys to be offered up in Sa|crifice, therefore le&s;t the whole Race of Man|kind, &s;hould by degrees be extirpated, he has permitted the Men, at lea&s;t tho&s;e of the Lai|ty, to keep more Wives than one: And &s;o &s;ome of them have 3, 4, 5, 6, or more Wives, every one according to his E&s;tate, whereby he is able to maintain a greater or le&s;&s;er number; but if any one takes more Wives then his means will maintain, he is to be beheaded: And therefore to prevent this, before any one Marries a Wife, he is to be examin'd whether he has &s;ufficient means to maintain her: Thus they may have many Wives, that they may beget many Chil|dren every Year; of whom &s;ome of the Sons are Sacrific'd, but the Daughters are all pre&s;erv'd for Matrimony, as will appear more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>In the mean time this is well worthy to be ob&s;erv'd, that neither the Brother can Marry his Si&s;ter, nor the Brother's Son his own Brother's Daughter; all Marriage
<PB N="201" REF="227">
within the&s;e 2 degrees of Con&s;anguinity (but not within the other degrees) being &s;o ab&s;olutely forbidden, that the High Prie&s;t him&s;elf cannot di&s;pen&s;e with it.</P>
<P>Whenever therefore a Man has a mind to take a Wife, whether he has one or more Wives before or no, he is fir&s;t to agree with the Father and Mother for their good will, and then to get the con&s;ent of the Daughter. After this, before he is Married, he is to make known his de&s;ign to the Sacrificator, who is to enquire whether he has &s;ufficient means to maintain this Wife he intends to Marry: And if he has, then all the Friends and Relations are call'd together, and the Bridegroom and Bride come along with them to the Gate of the Temple, where they are met by a Prie&s;t, or the chief Sacrificator, who asks them, what they de&s;ire to have done; to which the Bridegroom and Bride an&s;wer, they de&s;ire to be joyn'd together in Matrimony, after which an&s;wer they are permitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nter into the Temple. The rea&s;on why they are thus interrogated be|fore their Admi&s;&s;ion is this, becau&s;e no Man may enter into the Temple with any Wo|man but his Wife, except at the time when he is to be Married.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the Ceremonies towards the Dead.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ame Ceremonies are ob&s;erv'd towards every one that is Dead, whe|ther it be a Man or a Woman.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, many Prayers are put up and Sacrifices offer'd for the &s;ick Per&s;on: But after Death, the Dead Body is to be kept 32 Hours, and to be anointed with Oyl, whether it be to be burnt by Day or by Night. After this, a little while before the Hour wherein it is to be burnt, all the Friends and Relations of the Decas'd are &s;ent for, and in their pre&s;ence the Dead Bo|dy is plac'd in a Coffin, which Coffin is plac'd upon a Table: And then all the Com|pany that had been invited, &s;it down at this Table which is furni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of Meat, of which they eat freely. At la&s;t, when the Hour is come that the Body mu&s;t be carried away to the place of Burial, then come the Prie&s;ts both Regular and Secular, and the Players upon Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, and the Mourners, <HI>i. e.</HI> tho&s;e who Act the Part of Mourners for Money; And all the&s;e being come, the Coffin is laid upon a Litter

carried by 2 Elephants: All which may be better under&s;tood by the Figure here an|nex'd. But it is to be remark'd, that in the De&s;cription we have given of the Funeral Rites, we &s;uppo&s;e the Per&s;on Deceas'd to die Rich; for as to others, the Poorer they are, the fewer Ceremonies are ob&s;erv'd at their Funeral. Suppo&s;ing therefore that the Per&s;on Deceas'd was Rich, after all the afore&s;aid Ceremonies are ended, which are to be ob&s;erv'd at Home, then all the Com|pany which ought to be pre&s;ent at the Fu|nerals, meet together in the Hou&s;e of the Deceas'd, and having plac'd the Dead Body in a Litter, they walk from the Hou&s;e to the place where the Body is burnt in this order: Fir&s;t, one of the Officers of the City leads the Van, carrying the banner of the Deceas'd, then follow &s;everal Players upon In&s;truments making a doleful noi&s;e: After them (if the Per&s;on Deceas'd be a Noble|man, but not el&s;e) follow the Souldiers who are to guard the Body, whereof &s;ome are Arm'd with Lances, &s;ome with Bows and Arrows, and others walk with naked Swords in their Hands: After them follow the Re|gulars, before whom goes the Officer of the Convent, carrying the Arms of God and of the Abby; after him follows the <HI>Monks,</HI> and la&s;t of all comes the <HI>Abbot.</HI> After them come the Secular Prie&s;ts, and before them

Now when all this Company is come to the place where the Dead Body is to be burnt, then the Prie&s;ts Regular and

Secular are to pray for the purification of the Sacrifices: After this the Bea&s;ts are &s;lain and burnt, upon an Altar which is built there upon this occa&s;ion, and the a&s;hes of the burnt Sacrifices, are thrown upon the Pile of Wood, in which the Dead Body is to be burnt; and after the Coffin containing the Dead Body is plac'd upon the Pile, the fire is put to it, which burns till all is con&s;um'd to a&s;hes; and then the a&s;hes are buried in a place under ground, near the place where the Pile of wood &s;tood.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of our Opinion concerning the State of Souls after Death.</HEAD>
<P>SInce our Scripture or the Book, which they call <HI>Jarhabadiond,</HI> promi&s;es great happine&s;s after this Life, to tho&s;e who have liv'd according to the Natural, Divine and Human Laws, but &s;ays nothing expre&s;ly of the State of Souls after Death, hence we are divided into various Opinions about it.
<PB REF="233">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="207" REF="234">
The Tran&s;migration of Souls is generally believ'd by all of them, which appears to have been the common and ancient Opinion of almo&s;t all <HI>Pagans</HI>; but as to the manner of this Tran&s;migration we differ: For &s;ome believe that the Soul after Death, pa&s;&s;es into the Body of &s;ome Bea&s;t, either wild or tame, &s;ome that it pa&s;&s;es into the Body of another Man, either Poor or Rich, Happy or Mi&s;erable, according to its behaviour in the former body good or bad, and &s;o it conti|nues to pa&s;s out of the body of one Bea&s;t into another, or of one Man into another, in endle&s;s circuits of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery. Others have more &s;ublime Notions of a de|parted Soul, for they believe that the Soul which is to be rewarded with Happine&s;s af|ter this Life, &s;hall at la&s;t be transform'd into a Star, and then being plac'd in Heaven, it &s;hall enjoy all imaginable Happine&s;s, which will con&s;i&s;t in the vi&s;ion and fruition of our God: But becau&s;e the Sins of &s;uch a Soul de&s;ign'd for this Happine&s;s, which have been committed in this Life, are not always fully and perfectly blotted out before Death, but only cover'd, by the Sacrifices that have been offer'd for them; therefore they appoint a certain place, in which the Soul, before it arrives at this Happine&s;s, may do penance for its Sins, which place they think to be the bodies of &s;ome Bea&s;ts: And for this rea&s;on,
<PB N="208" REF="235">
they believe that God forbids the u&s;e of the&s;e Bea&s;ts for Food, and will not &s;uffer them to be kill'd, but only for Sacrifices, <HI>viz.</HI> Oxen, Rams, Elephants, Harts, Goats, Doves, Dogs, Hor&s;es, Camels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All which Bea&s;ts are forbidden to be &s;lain by any one, but only for Sacrifices; and if any of them die of them&s;elves, then they are Buried after their Death, lea&s;t they &s;hould be devour'd by wild Bea&s;ts. They believe therefore, that the&s;e Souls de&s;ign'd for Happine&s;s, &s;hall remain in the bodies of Bea&s;ts, until they have done penance for the Sins committed in their former bodies; But after &s;uch a Bea&s;t dies of it &s;elf, or is offer'd in Sacrifice to our God, then they believe that the Soul which was in it, &s;hall be transform'd into a Star in Heaven, where it &s;hall enjoy eternal Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>But all this &s;eems to me to be a fiction in|vented by our Prie&s;ts, becau&s;e they reap great profit and advantage by it; for when any one dies, the Relations of the Decea&s;ed, are to pay them a great Summ of Money, more or le&s;s, according to their Ability, which they promi&s;e to convey to the Soul under penance: For they per&s;wade the Peo|ple, that the Souls under penance &s;tand in need of Money, which none know how to tran&s;mit to them but them&s;elves: And be|&s;ides, they receive as much Money for the
<PB N="209" REF="236">
Prayers and Sacrifices, that are offer'd for the&s;e Souls while they continue in a State of penance.</P>
<P>As for the damn'd Souls, they determine nothing for a certain truth, but are divided into various Opinions. For &s;ome think that the&s;e Souls &s;hall inform the Bodies of evil Bea&s;ts, as they call the Lyons, Wolfs, Ti|gers, Apes, Cats, Swine, Serpents, and other &s;uch like Bea&s;ts. Others believe that they are in a manner annihilated, after they de|part out of the Body of a Man: But the more common Opinion is that of tho&s;e, who believe that they wander eternally in the Air, and that God Creates in them &s;uch a pain for the lo&s;s of their Happine&s;s, and &s;uch a &s;hame for the Sins they have committed, as fills them with a grief too great for Human Nature to bear. And the&s;e damn'd Souls they believe to be, what here in <HI>Europe</HI> you call Devils, and there they call <HI>os Pago&s;tos:</HI> And therefore they offer Sacrifices to the&s;e evil Spirits, becau&s;e they believe that the&s;e Sacrifices give them &s;ome ea&s;e of their pain, and &s;o hinder them from doing them&s;elves a mi&s;chief.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of the Prie&s;tly Garments.</HEAD>
<P>THE Prie&s;ts were formerly left at their liberty to wear any kind of Garments they pleas'd, provided they were &s;uch as would di&s;tingui&s;h them from the Laity: But now they have different kinds of Garments, every one according to their &s;everal Offices; which Cu&s;tom is never any more to be al|ter'd. What the&s;e Garments are may appear by the following de&s;cription of them.</P>
<P>The High Prie&s;t has a Sky-colour'd Mitre, the lower part of which is &s;hap'd like a Crown, and is placd upon a Bonnet; the Hair of his Head is &s;hort, and of his Beard long; he wears a little Cloak of a Sky-colour, which is round before, tapering be|hind, and reaches down only to the Elbow. He wears al&s;o a long Cloak like a Gown, which hath &s;leeves open in the middle thro' which he puts his Arms, and that al&s;o is of a Sky-colour. Under this Cloak there is a Cloth of a Violet-colour, which hangs down before and behind, and al&s;o a white Tunick. His &s;tockins are &s;uch as are commonly worn, but he has no breeches. He wears &s;hoes
<PB N="211" REF="238">
like <HI>Sandals,</HI> &s;uch as are commonly us'd by the <HI>Capuchines</HI> in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church. He carries an Iron-Rod in his Hand, being a Cubit long, having a round Head on which his Coat of Arms is Engraven.</P>
<P>The chief Sacrificator has al&s;o a Mitre upon his Bonnet, but no &s;hape of a Crown, and from the round part of the Bonnet there hangs a Cloth which reaches down to the ground: He has al&s;o a long Gown which is tied about with a Girdle. The Mitre is of a Sky-colour, &s;ignifying his dignity, and the Bonnet of a Red-colour, &s;ignifying his Of|fice of Sacrificator. The Cloth which hangs down from his Bonnet is of a Sky-colour, and his Gown is Red: He always carries a Sword in his Hand, in token of his bloody Office; his &s;hoes and &s;tockens are like tho&s;e of the High-Prie&s;t, and his Girdle is u&s;ually of a White-colour.</P>
<P>The common Sacrificator of our God, has a &s;harp-pointed Bonnet of a Red-colour, bending a little downward behind: He wears a Cloak like that of the High-Prie&s;t, but of a Red-colour, and it is &s;o &s;hort be|fore, that it covers only the Knee; but be|hind, it hangs down to the ground: He has al&s;o a Red Gown under his Cloak.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="239">The Sacrificators of the Sun, Moon and 10 Stars, have the &s;ame Garments, but of a different colour. The Sacrificator of the Sun, has a white Bonnet with the figure of the Sun on the top of it: He wears al&s;o a red Cloak and a white Tunick. The Sa|crificator of the Moon has a white Bonnet, and the figure of the Moon for di&s;tinction upon the top of it, a white Cloak and a red Gown. The Sacrificator of the 10 Stars, has the figure of them upon a white Bonnet, and behind, there is a &s;hort piece of Cloth hanging down from the Bonnet, he wears a red Cloak with a white Sleeve, and a white Tunick. All Sacrificators carry a Sword in their Hand.</P>
<P>The common Prie&s;ts have a kind of a Bonnet, upon which there is a &s;hort Mitre, &s;horter behind then before: They wear a long Gown of a white colour, who&s;e Sleeves are long and broad; they do not tye their Gown with a Girdle, but they have a &s;hort Tunick under it made of Cotton.</P>
<P>The Officers or Servants belonging to the Temples, have al&s;o a habit di&s;tinct from the Laity, for they wear a Bonnet different from the common People, a black Gown, and a black Rod about a Cubit long; and at all the common Meetings they carry the Arms of the Pari&s;h, and of Religion like a Ban|ner.</P>

Their &s;tockens and &s;hoes are like tho&s;e of other Prie&s;ts. Their Superior at publick Meetings has a Mitre upon his Head, and his Cowle hangs down behind: Be&s;ides, he has a little &s;hort Cloak like that of the High-Prie&s;ts, but it is of a Violet-colour; and a Violet-colour'd Cloth hanging down before and behind, and a long Tunick of a white-colour, and la&s;tly a long Cloak between the Tunick and the little Cloak, which u&s;ually is of Divers Colours: He ought to have a long Beard and &s;hort Hair on his Head, he carries an iron-rod in his Hand like the High-Prie&s;t; his &s;hoes and breeches are like the re&s;t of the Regulars: But when he is in the Abby, he wears the &s;ame kind of Cloaths as the other <HI>Monks.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Concerning their Manners and Cu&s;toms.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS certain that the Manners of the <HI>Formo&s;ans,</HI> are not &s;o Corrupt as the People are in other Places; and the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they are &s;trictly oblig'd to ob|&s;erve the Laws of their Policy and Religion under &s;evere Penalties, with which the Laws are enforc'd again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ion of any Villany or Impiety; &s;o that none dare to violate them, being re&s;train'd by the dread of their Penalties, which are certainly and impartially Executed.</P>
<P>They have divers Cu&s;toms which will plea&s;e &s;ome, and di&s;plea&s;e others: For fir&s;t, 'tis cu&s;tomary with them to adore the Em|peror as a God: He never &s;ets his Foot upon
<PB N="215" REF="242">
the ground, nor &s;uffers the Sun to &s;hine upon his Face. None but Noblemen are permit|ted to Vi&s;it him, nor are the Inferior People admitted to &s;ee him, except at the Great Fe|&s;tivals, which are but 3 in a Year; and then he &s;hows him&s;elf to all the People: But fir&s;t, they are to bend their Knees and fall pro&s;trate on the ground, and adore him: After they have done this, they may ri&s;e up and look upon him.</P>
<P>They Salute the Kings by bending their Knee, joyning their Hands and bowing their Head. They Salute the Vice-Roys al&s;o by bending one Knee, (<HI>viz.</HI> The Left, if he be the Vice-Roy of a Foreign King, and the Right if he be Vice-Roy of one of his own Kings) and al&s;o by carrying his Right Hand from his Head down to the ground.</P>
<P>They Salute an High-Prie&s;t as they do a King, and the chief Sacrificators as they do Vice-Roys. The Noblemen and Prie&s;ts are Saluted by carrying the Hand from the Head down to the &s;hoe, and by bowing the Head. One Friend Salutes another by ki&s;&s;ing both his Hands, and joyning them with his Friends. Superiors do not Salute an Infe|rior, but by a nod of their Head they &s;ig|nify, that they have &s;een him Saluting them. Servants Salute their Ma&s;ters, by carrying their Hand from their Mouth down to the ground, and falling pro&s;trate on their Face.
<PB N="216" REF="243">
Wives do Salute, and are Saluted after the &s;ame manner as their Husbands. In &s;peak|ing to Noblemen, they u&s;e not any particu|lar di&s;tinct Language as the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> do, nor any Circum-locutions, or different way of Con&s;truction from what is us'd to Inferior Per&s;ons, but calling them by their Title; and in &s;peaking to them, and even to the Empe|ror him&s;elf, they make u&s;e of the &s;econd Per&s;on of the &s;ingular Number: And this is the Cu&s;tomary way of &s;peaking to Great Men, which is ob&s;erv'd in all <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>No Conver&s;ation is allow'd between any Man and another Man's Wife, nor between a Batchelor and a Maid, but in the greate&s;t Fea&s;ts and Diver&s;ions every one keeps among tho&s;e of their own Family, the Wives with their own Husband, the Sons and Daughters with their Father and Mother; for if any Man &s;hould &s;ee one Man with another's Wife, or a Maid with a Batchelor that is a &s;tranger, he would certainly account them Adulterers.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing that a Man has 6 Wives, each Wife has a private Chamber for her &s;elf, in which &s;he lives with her own Sons and Daughters, and takes pains in &s;ome kind of work, and when the hour of Dinner or Sup|per comes, a Servant goes and knocks at their Doors; and then they come out of their Chambers into the Parlour where they
<PB N="217" REF="244">
are to eat. After Dinner, they may walk for &s;ometime with their Husband in the Gar|den, and then every one of them returns to her own Chamber again, and continues there until the time of Supper; only &s;ometimes they are allow'd to meet, and drink toge|ther, &s;uch Liquors as <HI>Thee, Chila, &amp;c.</HI> A&s;&s;oon as the hour of Supper is come, then a Ser|vant goes and calls them all, and they come to Supper. After Supper they walk, and divert them&s;elves with Dancing, Singing, or telling old Stories, or any &s;uch like Recrea|tion. At la&s;t, at the third hour of the Night (which is the 9th hour here in <HI>England</HI>) every one of them goes to her own Cham|ber, and the Husband &s;ends for one of them whom he has a mind to lye with that Night; and in the Day-time he &s;ometimes Vi&s;its one of them, &s;ometimes another, according to his fancy. This kind of Life is &s;weet and plea&s;ant enough, as long as every one of them is of an agreeable humor; but if the Husband begins to love one Wife more then another, then ari&s;es Envy and Emulation again&s;t that Woman whom he loves mo&s;t, and hence &s;trife and di&s;cord is &s;pread thro' the whole Family: But when the Hus|band is civil and di&s;creet, and imparts to each of them an equal &s;hare of his good will and friend&s;hip, then all the Wives en|deavour to plea&s;e him in all things, and the
<PB N="218" REF="245">
Hou&s;e is like a Paradi&s;e, by their good agree|ment, and dutiful care of their Husband. The Women employ them&s;elves in &s;ome kind of work proper for them, in teaching and taking care of their Children: And &s;ometimes they Vi&s;it one another, or &s;pend their time in Innocent Recreations. And while they continue dutiful and peaceable, they may have any thing of their Husbands that they de&s;ire: Who always Marry them when they are very young, <HI>viz.</HI> Between 10 and 15 Years of Age, that they may the more ea&s;ily bend them to comply with their humor. Every Wife takes care of her own Children; but if one die and leave Children behind her, then the Husband Marries ano|ther and commits the care of them to her.</P>
<P>This Prerogative is granted to the fir&s;t Wife above all the re&s;t: That &s;he is to take care of the Family, and is not &s;o much &s;ub|ject to the Husband as the others are; for the other Wives cannot go out of the Hou&s;e, unle&s;s the Husband be with them, but the fir&s;t Wife may. Be&s;ides, her fir&s;t Son is ne|ver to be Sacrific'd, but is the Heir of the Fa|mily, as we &s;hall &s;how hereafter; and when the Husband dies, the fir&s;t Wife governs the Family, and the re&s;t are &s;ubject to her. And this Cu&s;tom prevails al&s;o among the <HI>Japan|ners,</HI> but with this difference: That the <HI>Ja|pan</HI> Women after the Death of their Hus|band
<PB N="219" REF="246">
may Marry again, but the <HI>Formo&s;an</HI> cannot; the former receives &s;ome Portion of their Father's E&s;tate, but the latter do not.</P>
<P>When any Man has a mind to Marry a Maid, with whom he is in love, he mu&s;t fir&s;t acquaint the Father and Mother with his de&s;ign, and di&s;cover to them what E&s;tate he has, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And if the Father and Mother con&s;ent to give him their Daughter in Mar|riage, then he is permitted to &s;peak to the Daughter, but never before: Neither then is he allow'd to conver&s;e with her in private, but only in the pre&s;ence of the Father or Mo|ther, or one of the Maids Kindred: And if the Daughter con&s;ent, then the Father and Mother pre&s;ent him with &s;ome Gift of &s;mall Value, as a Ring, &s;ome Clothes, or the like, but they give him no Portion out of the Fa|ther's E&s;tate with her.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Born Son of the fir&s;t Wife, as has been already noted, is not to be Sacri|fic'd, and is the Heir of the Family: Now the Right of Inheritance con&s;i&s;ts in this, that he receives one half of the E&s;tate after the Father's Death: But the Brethren di|vide the other half among them; and if any one of them will Marry a Wife before the Death of the Father, then the Wife whom he Marries, continues in the Hus|band's Family until the Father be Dead, and then the E&s;tate is divided, and each Brother
<PB N="220" REF="247">
takes his &s;hare of it, and lives by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Tis Cu&s;tomary on Solemn Days, between the fir&s;t and la&s;t Day of a Fe&s;tival, for all &s;orts of People, to Fea&s;t their Relations and Friends, as they u&s;e to do at Births, Mar|riages and Burials, which has been already ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>The Poor are not &s;uffer'd to beg in the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> but every Precinct has &s;ome Publick Hou&s;e, wherein they keep all their Poor, who are Fed and Cloth'd at the Charge of the whole Precinct; and tho&s;e of them who are able, are put to Work and Labour, but others who are di&s;abled by Age or Sickne&s;s, are maintain'd <HI>Gratis.</HI> This Publick Hou&s;e is call'd the Hou&s;e of God for the Poor, or in the Language of the Na|tives, <HI>Caa tuen pagot ack chabis-collinos.</HI> If any &s;tranger, who comes from &s;ome other I&s;land of the <HI>Japan</HI> Empire, happens to want &s;ub&s;i&s;tence while he is Travelling thro' the Country, he is furni&s;h'd with nece&s;&s;aries in every City and Village that he pa&s;&s;es thro' at the expence of the publick.</P>
<P>They have al&s;o Taverns and Victualling-Hou&s;es, which Men frequent for Eating and Drinking, Smoking and Playing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But no Woman mu&s;t come into any of the&s;e Publick Hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="248">All <HI>Japanners</HI> were wont to be very curi|ous to &s;ee &s;trangers, and to entertain them very civilly; but ever &s;ince the great &s;laugh|ter was made of the Chri&s;tians that were there, they hate all &s;trangers that come into their Country, unle&s;s they come from &s;ome other I&s;land of <HI>Japan,</HI> as will appear more fully hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. A De&s;cription of the Men in <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALtho' the Country be very hot, yet the Men in all <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> are very fair, at lea&s;t tho&s;e who can live upon their Means; but the Country People, Servants, and others, who are expos'd to the heat of the Sun, and are forc'd to work in the open Air all Day, are very much tawn'd by the burning heat. The Men of E&s;tates, but e&s;pecially the Wo|men, are very fair; for they during the hot &s;ea&s;on, live under ground in places that are very cold: They have al&s;o Gardens and Groves in them &s;o thick &s;et with Trees, that the Sun cannot penetrate thro' them; and they have Tents which they u&s;e to &s;prinkle with water, &s;o that the heat can do them no
<PB N="222" REF="249">
hurt: And hence it comes to pa&s;s, that altho the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> live in a hotter Country than the Engli&s;h, yet they cannot &s;o well endure heat.</P>
<P>They u&s;e Di&s;till'd Waters, not only to wa&s;h them&s;elves, but al&s;o to remove any &s;peck upon the skin, which is not rooted in the fle&s;h: And this is one means which makes them &s;o fair.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t not omit to give &s;ome account of a Controver&s;ie, between the <HI>Chi|ne&s;e</HI> and <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> on the one &s;ide, and the Natives of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> on the other, relating to the Cu&s;toms of the&s;e Countries. Ye mu&s;t know then that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> make their Teeth artificially black, but the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> pre&s;erve theirs white. The <HI>Jap|pane&s;e</HI> plead for their Cu&s;tom, that all Beau|ty con&s;i&s;ts in Variety of Colours, and there|fore as an <HI>Ethiopian</HI> is counted mo&s;t Beauti|ful, who has a black Face and white Teeth; So the Beauty of the Natives in our Coun|try who have a fair Face, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in having black Teeth. But the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> granting this argument, an&s;wer for them|&s;elves, that Beauty may con&s;i&s;t in &s;ome things, which cannot be had: Thus it would be Beautiful to have black Eyes, which yet cannot be made &s;o, and therefore, &s;ay they, nothing artificial ought to be made u&s;e of, to make us appear otherwi&s;e than Nature has fram'd us.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="250">Hence the Reader may ob&s;erve, that the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> are al&s;o white and very fair, but chiefly the Women; and if we may believe the Proverb, <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Japan</HI> breeds the faire&s;t Women in the World. The <HI>Formo|&s;ans,</HI> generally &s;peaking, are of a &s;hort &s;tature, but they make up in thickne&s;s what they want in tallne&s;s. They are commonly &s;trong-bodied Men and indefatigable in La|bour; they are very good Souldiers, and love War better then Peace. They are very kind and good-natur'd towards their Coun|trymen: Whom they love, they love &s;o well, that they would lo&s;e their Lives for them in a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; but whom they hate, they hate mortally, and u&s;ually con|trive their Death in any way that's po&s;&s;ible to them. They are very Indu&s;trious and Cunning, and quickly learn any thing they &s;ee done before them. They abhor all fal&s;e|hood and lying, and therefore they have no value for Merchants, becau&s;e they u&s;e many lies to commend their Wares, and put them off at a better Price.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the Cloaths worn in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> by all Ranks of People.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> are certainly very curi|ous in their Cloaths, but they affect no new fa&s;hions as the <HI>Europians</HI> do; wherefore they &s;eem to be &s;till Cloathed according to their Ancient Cu&s;tom. In this they excel the <HI>Europeans,</HI> that the Qualities and Condi|tions of Men may be di&s;cern'd there by the di&s;tinction of their Habits, whereas here a Nobleman cannot be known from a Trade&s;|man by his Cloaths.

The great difference be|tween the <HI>Jappanne&s;e</HI> and <HI>Forma&s;ans,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in this, that the <HI>Jappanne&s;e</HI> wear 2 or 3 Coats, which they tye about with a Girdle; but the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> have only one Coat, and u&s;e no Girdle. They walk with their Brea&s;t open, and cover their Privy parts with a Plate tied about them made of Bra&s;s, Gold, or Silver. The <HI>Jappanne&s;e</HI> al&s;o wear little

<P>We &s;hall add no more about the <HI>Jappan|ne&s;e,</HI> &s;ince our de&s;ign is only to give an ac|count of the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a:</HI> And &s;eeing, as I have &s;aid, the dignity and condition of every one may be di&s;cern'd by their different Ha|bits, I &s;hall now briefly de&s;cribe them.</P>
<P>The King wears a &s;hort Coat of Silk, which he ties with a mo&s;t precious Girdle, and above that a long open Gown made of very co&s;tly Silk, wrought with Gold and Silver: He has a Scarf that hangs over the Right Shoulder, and reaches down to the left &s;ide, of Cloth of Gold or Silver curiou&s;ly wrought with the Needle, which is the Badge of his Dignity. He wears al&s;o a Bonnet, from who&s;e top the &s;tuff hangs down to the ground, which Bonnet is en|compa&s;s'd with a kind of a Crown, that gli|&s;ters with precious Stones and Carbuncles. He has no Breeches, but his Knees are nak|ed; he wears &s;tockens made of Silk, adorn'd with many Ribbons. His &s;hoes, like tho&s;e of the Prie&s;ts afore-mention'd, are a &s;ort of Sandals, but mo&s;t curiou&s;ly wrought. When he or any Nobleman Rides, then he wears Stockens and Breeches together in one piece,
<PB N="226" REF="255">
and a little Bonnet. His Collar is made of Silk, but &s;et with precious Stones; the Hair of his Head is &s;hort, as is u&s;ual thro' all <HI>Ja|pan,</HI> and his Beard is about a Thumb's length.</P>
<P>The Queen wears mo&s;t Beautiful Gar|ments, that gli&s;ter with precious Stones; &s;he has no &s;uch Headgeer as the Women wear here in <HI>England,</HI> but &s;omething made of Gold or Silver wrought with Silk, and &s;o adorn'd with Diamonds, that it &s;eems to be a Crown. Her Neck-cloth is made of &s;ome precious matter: Her Garments are very precious, curiou&s;ly wrought with the Nee|dle, and long enough to reach down to her Heel; and the upper part of her &s;leeve is &s;o broad that it touches the ground, as does al&s;o her Manto which hangs down &s;o low be|hind. Her &s;hoes and &s;tockens are like her Husband's, but of a le&s;s &s;ize, and have a higher Heel. She wears her Hair hanging down behind, over her Gown which is not wide, nor hath many plaits. She wears a Girdle tied about her body very precious.</P>
<P>The Sons are clad after the &s;ame manner as the Father; only in&s;tead of the &s;hort Gown, they go with their Brea&s;ts wide open, and have a half-girdle about their Loyns. They wear not a Bonnet until they be 9 Years old. The Daughters al&s;o are Cloath'd after the &s;ame manner as the Mother, except

as to their Head-gear, for they wear nothing upon their Head, but a little Crown made of flowers, or the feathers of &s;ome Bird; and they have no Manto.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roy who had formerly been a King, is &s;till very &s;plendid in his Cloaths. His Bonnet is very great and precious, both for the matter of it, and the Curio&s;ity of the Workman&s;hip, and it is adorn'd with preci|ous Stones; the Hair of his Head, and his Beard is &s;hort; his Collar is of black Silk finely wrought with Silver. He wears a &s;hort Coat of white Silk, which is tied about with a precious Girdle, and over that a long Gown open and wide; he has al&s;o a Scarf like the King, which hangs on the right-&s;houlder down to the left-&s;ide; and la&s;tly, over his &s;houlders he has a little Cloak made of red and black Silk; his Ve&s;t is lin'd with the skin of &s;ome Tyger or Leo|pard; he has no breeches, but only &s;tockens, and his &s;hoes are like tho&s;e afore-menti|on'd.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roys Queen is Dre&s;s'd much after the &s;ame manner as the Queen, &s;aving that the Queen has a Coyff, &s;uch as above-de&s;crib'd; but the Vice-Roy's Queen, wears only her own Hair adorn'd with Silk and Ribbons: Her Gown is made after the &s;ame fa&s;hion as the Queen's; but her Manto is different in this, that the Queen's Manto
<PB N="228" REF="259">
hangs down behind only from her &s;houl|ders; but that of the Vice-Roy's Queen is like a large Morning-Gown, which is worn here in <HI>England:</HI> Only it wants &s;leeves, and is lin'd with &s;ome Beautiful skin. The Vice-Roy's Son has 2 Coats, a &s;hort one and ano|ther long; but the &s;horter one is uppermo&s;t, and comes down only to the Knee: His Daughters are clad after the &s;ame manner as the Mother, &s;aving that they have no Man|to.</P>
<P>The Noblemen wear the &s;ame Coats as the Vice-Roy, but with this difference, that the Vice-Roy has no Girdle about his long Coat, which the Noblemen have: They wear a Scarf of Silk from the right-&s;houlder to the left-&s;ide, but their Bonnet is like that of the Citizens.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carillan,</HI> or Chief-General, has a Bon|net like the Vice-Roys, but not &s;o Great: In the fore-part it is adorn'd with a Diamond and Precious Stones: His Collar is of Silk, which encompa&s;&s;es his Neck, but does not hang down. In&s;tead of a Scarf, he has a &s;hort Cloak of Silk, which covers only his &s;houlders; and a &s;hort Tunick of Silk; his breeches and &s;tockens are tied together; his &s;hoes are like other Men's: And la&s;tly, he has a long and wide open Gown, like the Morning Gowns that are worn here, but much larger, who&s;e &s;leeves being open in

<P>The Citizens wear one Gown only, ought to keep the Hair of their Head &s;hort, have a Bonnet like the Noblemen, who&s;e top made of Silk or Cotton, reaches down to the ground: They wear a Collar, but no &s;hirt, except in the Night-time when they go to Bed, which is the Cu&s;tom of them all. They walk in a long Gown with Naked Brea&s;t and Thighs, but their Privy-parts are cover'd with a Plate tied about them made of Bra&s;s or Silver, or Gold: Their &s;tockens and &s;hoes are &s;uch as are commonly us'd by others.</P>

Infants wear a &s;hort Gown that reaches down to the mid|dle of their Thigh; they have &s;tockens and &s;hoes like others, but they do not cover their Head until they be 9 Years old. Virgins after they are 9 Years old, adorn their Head with Birds feathers, or artificial flowers done up with Ribbons: They wear a &s;hort Gown above another, that is long and

reaches to the ground, both which they tie about them with a green Girdle. The long Gown is divided into two in the lower part, &s;o that their Legs appear as high as their Knee. They have &s;tockens and &s;hoes like other Women.</P>
<P>The Brides at the time of their Marriage do wonderfully adorn them&s;elves; their Head is encompa&s;s'd round with Flowers, Laurels and Feathers, which make a great &s;how: They have two Coats equally long, whereof the under Coat is white and the upper black, and both of them are tied with a black Girdle. They wear a Scarf of red Silk hanging on the left &s;houlder down to the right &s;ide. The black Gown which is uppermo&s;t is open, &s;o that the white Petti|coat underneath may be &s;een. And after this manner they are clad during all the time of Court&s;hip, but 9 Days after the Celebra|tion of Marriage, they put on the Habit of Married Women.</P>
<P>The Married Women wear a long open Gown, and below it a &s;hort Coat which reaches down to their Knee. They have a kind of a Cap upon their Head like a Plat|ter, and let their Hair hang down in wreaths before their Brea&s;t; and when they go out, they &s;o cover their Face, that it can hardly be &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="266">Widdows have another kind of a Cap which is twofold: The fir&s;t which they put on their Head, is almo&s;t round like an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman's Coyff, the other is a little &s;harp|pointed. They dre&s;s their Hair in wreaths; they wear 2 Gowns, one long and another &s;hort one over it; the &s;hort one ought always to be of a black colour, but the other, which may be of any other colour, has long and broad &s;leeves, which reach down to the Knee; and both the Gowns are tied about with a Girdle.</P>
<P>The Country Women have nothing but a Bear's skin upon their &s;houlders, and a Cloth about their middle which reaches down to their Knee: They tye a piece of Linnen about their Head and Hair; they have no &s;tockens, but &s;hoes, &s;uch as are worn by others. Their Daughters wear nothing but a Cloth about their middle, and a Scarf on the right &s;houlder hanging down to the left &s;ide, and they have &s;hoes like their Mo|ther.</P>
<P>And here 'tis to be ob&s;erv'd, that all of them generally wear a Bracelet about their Arm; but the Women wear it both about their Arm and their Neck. And this is all that I know to be remarkable as to their Apparel; I &s;hall now only add &s;omething as to the Military Habit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Of their Cities, Hou&s;es, Palaces, Ca&s;tles.</HEAD>
<P>THere are only &s;ix Towns in the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> which de&s;erve the Name of a City: Two of them are in the Principal I&s;land, and they are call'd <HI>Xternet&s;a</HI> and <HI>Big|no</HI>; there is one in great <HI>Peorko,</HI> which is call'd <HI>Chabat</HI>; and the 4th is in one of the I&s;les of Robbers, and is call'd <HI>Arriow:</HI> The 5th and 6th are in the other I&s;le of Robbers, and they are call'd <HI>Pineto</HI> and <HI>Jarabut:</HI> But in the little I&s;le <HI>Peorko</HI> there are none, as will appear afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Xternet&s;a,</HI> as it is the Capital City, &s;o it is the mo&s;t Beautiful of all the re&s;t; being &s;i|tuated in a very plea&s;ant Plain: It's Walls are 20 Cubits high and 8 broad; It's length is about 12 Day's Journey for an Ele|phant, <HI>i. e.</HI> about &s;ix <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles. There are in it De&s;ert-places, Fields and Moun|tains,
<PB N="236" REF="271">
Orchards, Meadows, and the like Places which are not Inhabited; but about the middle of it, the Hou&s;es are very mag|nificent and &s;tately: Not far from it, there is a Mountain which abounds with many whole&s;om Springs. It is built by the &s;ide of a River, which was made there on pur|po&s;e for its convenience; It abounds with Fi&s;h and runs over the whole I&s;le. That which contributes much to make it Beauti|ful, are the many Palaces that are in it, <HI>viz.</HI> Of the King, the Vice-Roy, and the No|bles; of the High-Prie&s;t and Chief Sacrifi|cator; all which are built after a wonderful manner, as may appear by the Figure here annex'd, which is a Repre&s;entation of the Vice-Roy's Palace.</P>
<P>This Palace is built of four-&s;quare &s;tones, curiou&s;ly cut, as all the re&s;t are, whereof the greate&s;t part is cover'd with Gold: This Hou&s;e alone is three <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles in Circum|ference, having a great Ditch round about it. Be&s;ides there belong to it, Greens, Gar|dens, Walks, Groves, all which are enclos'd with a Wall.</P>
<P>The High-Prie&s;t and Vice-Roy have Pa|laces there almo&s;t as good; but the King and <HI>Carillan,</HI> who&s;e Offices do not de&s;cend by Succe&s;&s;ion to their Po&s;terity, do not care to have &s;uch &s;tately Hou&s;es. But the No|bles have there very Beautiful and Magnifi|cent
<PB N="237" REF="272">
Hou&s;es. There are al&s;o in the City <HI>Xter|net&s;a</HI> 3 great Abbies, and 5 Temples, and ma|ny Beautiful Hou&s;es of the Citizens. 'Tis ob|&s;ervable, that in the whole I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> there are no Hou&s;es very high, but in mo&s;t Great Hou&s;es there are 2 &s;tories, one above ground for the Cold &s;ea&s;on, and the other under ground for the Hot &s;ea&s;on; which in all re|&s;pects are very Magnificent, whether you look upon them within or without.</P>
<P>The Rich Men and Nobles, build their Hou&s;es of four-&s;quare Stones; but others build the outer-part of plain Timber, while the inner-part is adorn'd with Painted Wood, or fine Earthen Ware Gilded and Painted, which the Natives there call <HI>Porchellano,</HI> but the <HI>Engli&s;h China</HI>-Ware. The Citizens Hou&s;es are long, and the Country People's round, in &s;uch manner as they appear in the Figures here annex'd.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The Place above the Roof of the Hou&s;e, where they adore the Sun, Moon and Stars twice a Day. <HI>B.</HI> The Roof of the Hou&s;e. C. The Place above ground. <HI>D.</HI> The Place of the Hou&s;e which is under ground.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;uch long Hou&s;es are &s;ome|times to be found in the Villages, and tho&s;e that are round in the Cities, at lea&s;t in the remote Places of them.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="273"><HI>Bigno</HI> is a fine City, but has nothing pe|culiar that is remarkable. In the &s;ame Prin|cipal I&s;land, is the Sea-Port Town call'd <HI>Kadzey,</HI> which is very large and contains many Villages, and yet becau&s;e it is not Wall'd about, it is accounted only a Vil|lage.</P>
<P><HI>Chabat, Arriow</HI> and <HI>Pineto</HI> are Cities, which have nothing peculiar that is remark|able, but in <HI>Jarabut</HI> 'tis worth ob&s;ervation, that the City is build round about a Moun|tain, which is a Mile high; And upon the top of it, is built the Palace of the Go|vernour, who from his Hou&s;e can &s;ee the whole City, and &s;o can every Citizen from the Roof of his Hou&s;e behold the Gover|nour's Palace. Be&s;ides in the &s;ame City, there is a Fountain repre&s;enting an Elephant Dan|cing upon 2 Feet, which is 20 Cubits high, and throws forth water out of all the Parts of the Body.</P>
<P>This Fountain is believ'd by the <HI>Jappan|ne&s;e</HI> to have been built above 11500 Years ago, by a certain God or Hero, who had been Bani&s;h'd thither when the I&s;le was yet uninhabited. This God was call'd <HI>Arbalo,</HI> or Wanderer: And the &s;tory &s;ays, that when he had built this Fountain there, it furni&s;h'd him with Fruit, fle&s;h and &s;weet Wine; but that after &s;uch time as he left the I&s;land, it became barren, and produc'd
<PB N="239" REF="274">
none of the&s;e things. After this I&s;land came to be Inhabited, &s;ome Men coming there and finding the curious fabrick of this Foun|tain, convey'd water into it by Aquaeducts, from a Mountain which is in the mid&s;t of the City: From whence the <HI>Jappanne&s;e</HI> have &s;till in their Temple <HI>Amida,</HI> the God <HI>Arbalo</HI> with a Painted Fountain. But the Natives of the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> give no credit to this &s;to|ry: Tho they know not by whom, nor when this Fountain was built, yet they call the Place of the Fountain by the Name <HI>Arbalo.</HI></P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory I do not deliver for a certain Truth, but neither do I account it altogether fabulous; for it &s;eems to me very probable, that there is &s;omething of truth in it, and therefore for the explication of it, I &s;hall add the following remarks.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, the Reader is to take notice, that all the Gods which are call'd by any particular Name, &s;uch as <HI>Amida, Xakha, Na|kon, Arbalo, &amp;c.</HI> Are only Saints, or Heroes and Illu&s;trious Men, who in former times were deified, either for their reputed Sancti|ty or &s;ome Noble Exploits, or wonderful Feats which they had perform'd. Such an one was <HI>Arbalo,</HI> who is the God of Harve&s;t among the <HI>Japone&s;e,</HI> and who&s;e Image is commonly &s;et in the husk of a Grain of Bar|ley. He is called <HI>Arbalo, i. e.</HI> a Wanderer,
<PB N="240" REF="275">
becau&s;e he continually went about the Fields and Woods, ble&s;&s;ing the Fruits of the Ground.</P>
<P>Now 'tis po&s;&s;ible, that this Man while he was alive did &s;omething that di&s;pleas'd the Emperor, or the <HI>Dairo,</HI> for which rea&s;on he was Bani&s;h'd from his Native Country, and there is no difficulty in conceiving this: But how he &s;hould Travel from <HI>Japan</HI> to <HI>For|mo&s;a,</HI> which is 200 Leagues di&s;tant from it, and was then unknown to the <HI>Japone&s;e,</HI> and uninhabited, is &s;omething difficult to appre|hend. Let us therefore &s;uppo&s;e, that this God <HI>Arbalo</HI> was de&s;cended of &s;ome Noble Race, for &s;uch are all the Heroes in <HI>Japan,</HI> who were either come of &s;ome Illu&s;trious Family, or had been promoted to &s;ome Emi|nent Po&s;t of Honour: And this is the more probable, becau&s;e if he had been &s;ome infe|rior and mean Family, he would rather have been puni&s;h'd with Death, than &s;ent in|to Bani&s;hment for his offence. This being granted, we may &s;uppo&s;e further, that this Honourable Per&s;on carried along with him as his Retinue a great Multitude of Servants, and was &s;ent at fir&s;t, at an I&s;le next adjoyning to <HI>Japan,</HI> and from thence pa&s;&s;ing on in a direct Line through many little I&s;les, (which are &s;o near, that you may &s;ee from one to the other in a clear Day) he came at la&s;t in &s;ight of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> where out of Curio&s;ity he
<PB N="241" REF="276">
landed with his Servants; and finding it a plea&s;ant and fruitful Country, he &s;ettled there for &s;ome time, and built the Fountain above-mention'd. And then we may &s;up|po&s;e, that he return'd again to <HI>Japan,</HI> and &s;ent from thence &s;ome Colonies to Inhabit <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI> But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that we have no Hi&s;tory in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> &s;o Ancient as this, which is only to be found in <HI>Japan,</HI> and therefore we can give no account of any thing that happen'd between us and the <HI>Ja|pone&s;e,</HI> after this fir&s;t Settlement; for we have lo&s;t all the Memoirs of our fir&s;t Original, and the tran&s;actions which happen'd after the fir&s;t Plantation of our Country, until the <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> ravi&s;h'd our Kingdom from us, and re&s;tor'd it to the Empire of <HI>Japan.</HI> How|ever it may appear from what has been &s;aid, that the &s;tory of <HI>Arbalo</HI> is not fabulous, nor &s;o improbable as at fir&s;t blu&s;h it may &s;eem to be.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Cities already Nam'd, there are 3 Sea-Port Towns which exceed &s;ome Cities for bigne&s;s; but becau&s;e they are not Wall'd about, they are held only Villages or Towns. The&s;e 3 are call'd <HI>Aok, Louctau,</HI> and <HI>Voo,</HI> and be&s;ides them, there are many other Villages of the like bigne&s;s. But this is to be noted of Villages, Sea-Port Towns and others, that they all depend on their
<PB N="242" REF="277">
own Cities, and that the other Cities depend upon the Capital City <HI>Xternet&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>In the little <HI>Peorko,</HI> there is neither City nor Village to be found: But concerning this I&s;land it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that at fir&s;t it belong'd to the King who is now Vice-Roy, but afterwards the Prie&s;ts purchas'd it, to feed in it the four-footed Bea&s;ts which are de&s;ign'd for Sacrifice: And now every one is oblig'd to give not the fir&s;t Fruits of their flocks, but one out of every three Bea&s;ts that fall, which is to be kept there until it be fit to be Sacrific'd: And therefore in little <HI>Peorko,</HI> there are only &s;ome Shepherd's who look after the Bea&s;ts that are fed in that I&s;land, which is very fruitful in Gra&s;s and Hay, and might perhaps produce many other things if they were Planted there: But this is not done becau&s;e it is de&s;ign'd only for the Bea&s;ts afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the notable things that oc|cur to me concerning their Cities, Villages and Hou&s;es; yet it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that there is a great deal of difference be|tween the Cities of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Japan,</HI> both for their Bigne&s;s and the Rich|ne&s;s of their Materials, tho the <HI>Jappanne&s;e</HI> when they come to <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> cannot &s;uffici|ently admire its Cities, for their Beauty, Si|tuation and Conveniences.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of the Commodities which they have, and &s;ome that they want.</HEAD>
<P>THE great quantity of Gold and Silver that is in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> is that which brings them the greate&s;t Profit; for in the Princi|pal I&s;land, they have two Mines of Gold and two of Bra&s;s, tho none of Silver; In Great <HI>Peorko</HI> there are 2 Mines, one of Gold and another of Silver. In one of the <HI>I&s;les of Robbers</HI> there is a Mine call'd a Gold-Mine, which is not valued in others Coun|ties becau&s;e it is not truly and properly Gold; but it is highly e&s;teem'd in the I&s;le where it is found, becau&s;e it is fitter for ma|ny nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es among them than Gold it &s;elf is. In the other <HI>I&s;le of Robbers</HI> there are 2 little Silver-Mines; So that in all, there are 3 Mines of Gold and 3 of Silver. All the&s;e Mines formerly pertain'd to the Vice-Roy, but now the King has one third Part, and the Emperor another.</P>
<P>Silver in <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> is almo&s;t e&s;teem'd as much as Gold, becau&s;e it is fitter for u&s;e, being a &s;of|ter Mettal which is more ea&s;ily wrought in|to any &s;hape. They have no Iron or Steel,
<PB N="244" REF="279">
but what the <HI>Jappanne&s;e</HI> bring thither, who have one Mine of Iron: And therefore Iron, and al&s;o Copper, which is brought from other Parts, is more e&s;teem'd there than Gold and Silver: But Bra&s;s is very common among them.</P>
<P>Uten&s;ils and Di&s;hes, are u&s;ually made of Gold or <HI>China</HI> Earth: Their Temples and Hou&s;es are often cover'd with Gold, both in Cities and Villages: But &s;ince the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> came there and exchanged their Iron for our Gold, the Natives have more rarely made any Gold.</P>
<P>Lead and Tinn are not the product of the I&s;le, but they are abundantly &s;upplied with it from the Neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P><HI>Silks,</HI> and <HI>Cotton,</HI> of two &s;orts, they have in great quantities, which are very Artificially Inter-woven with Gold and Silver: One &s;ort of Cotten grows upon Trees in bags and is the finer &s;ort, another grows up|on a Shrub like a Thi&s;tle and is a coar&s;er &s;ort. And this is the great Employment of the Women, who of the&s;e Materials make Clothes, Carpets, Tape&s;try, and &s;uch kind of things; wonderfully fine. Of Silk and Hair are made Velvet and Plu&s;h: But this kind of Work belongs to the Men and not to the Women. They have not Woollen-cloth becau&s;e they know not how to make it but they receive great quantities of this
<PB N="245" REF="280">
Cloth from the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> They make Stuffs of Hair and Cotton, but no Cloth of Flax, which does not grow there; but Flax|en Cloth they receive from the <HI>Dutch.</HI> They Work, paint, and Gild <HI>China-Earth</HI> very Wonderfully, nay even much finer then they do in <HI>China.</HI> They have learn'd from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to make a kind of Paper, which they knew not how to do before; for they wrote either upon plates of Copper or upon Parchment. But now they Write on Paper made of Silk after the &s;ame man|ner as it is made here.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of Leather to make Shoes of, they u&s;e the bark of Trees for the Soles, and &s;ome skins of Bea&s;ts to &s;erve for the Upper|leather.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Of Weights and Mea&s;ures.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore the <HI>Dutch</HI> arriv'd on our Coa&s;ts, we had a certain way of reckoning things, whereby we could know when their Numbers were equal or unequal; but we had no kind of weight, &s;uch as a Pound or an Ounce, and therefore we bought and &s;old
<PB N="246" REF="281">
things by View, and not by Weight. But after the <HI>Hollanders</HI> came among us, and &s;how'd us how Profitable the u&s;e of Pounds and Ounces would be in Commerce, we be|gun to weigh things that are rare by Ounces, and Pounds; but things that are common and le&s;s valuable, by 50, or 100<HI>l.</HI> weight at a time, as the Buyer and Seller had a mind: Our Pound agrees with the <HI>Dutch</HI> Pound, which con&s;i&s;ts of 16 Ounces, and is more then that Pound which is us'd in <HI>France:</HI> Which I found by a <HI>Copan</HI> of our Money that I brought with me to <HI>France,</HI> which weigh'd more then one of the <HI>French</HI> Pounds, tho it was but a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pound.</P>
<P>Things are mea&s;ur'd in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> accord|ing to the People's various humors, for &s;ome u&s;e a greater, &s;ome a le&s;s mea&s;ure; but the price is always fix'd according to the Great|ne&s;s of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument wherewith they weigh things, is &s;uch as is us'd by the Butchers here in <HI>England</HI> when they weigh their Meat, but &s;ome are Bigger, &s;ome le&s;s as their oc|ca&s;ions require.</P>
<P>They had no Names for Numbers be|fore the <HI>Dutch</HI> came here, but they &s;uffici|ently declar'd to one another what Num|ber they meant by their Signs and Fingers; but becau&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> did not under&s;tand this way of Reckoning, they per&s;waded us
<PB N="247" REF="282">

<PB N="248" REF="283">
of which they do not make a good or bad Omen, and Particularly they lay a great &s;tre&s;s on Dreams; of all which I &s;hall give &s;ome In&s;tances, &s;o far as I can Remember. If any one Dreams that he is at a great Fea&s;t among Women, this Sig|nifies that he has many Enemies, who are Contriving to kill him or do him &s;ome Mi&s;chief. If any one Dreams that he is bit or hurt by a <HI>Lyon,</HI> a <HI>Serpent,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch Bea&s;t, he ought to have a care of a certain E|nemy who will attempt to do him an Injury; but if he Dreams that he has kill'd a Wild Bea&s;t, then he thinks him&s;elf Secure from all Danger until a contrary Dream happens: If any one Dreams that one of his Relations or him&s;elf is Dead, they believe that God is angry with him, and therefore they u&s;ually con&s;ult the Prie&s;ts what they are to do in this ca&s;e, who always advi&s;e them to give &s;omething wherewithal to Atone their angry God. If any one Dreams that he has Lice, Gnats, or Ants, upon his Body, then they think that the Soul of &s;ome of their deceas'd Relations is detain'd in the Body of &s;ome Bea&s;t, (as was before-men|tioned) and wants Money and other things; which they therefore take care to give to the Prie&s;ts, that they may convey them to the Soul in di&s;tre&s;s. If any one dreams that he has lain with another man's Wife, then he is afraid le&s;t &s;ome man lie with one
<PB N="249" REF="284">
of his Wives, and therefore he more narrowly ob&s;erves them then at other times. And &s;o much may &s;uffice concerning Dreams.</P>
<P>They ob&s;erve al&s;o other Omens, as the fir&s;t thought that comes into their mind in a Morning after &s;leep, and the fir&s;t Bea&s;t they &s;ee in a Morning: But then they &s;ay, if &s;uch a thing which comes into their mind do not &s;trike their Fancy, the Omen concerns &s;ome other Body, but if it &s;trikes the Imagination, then they apply it to them|&s;elves. There were a certain &s;ort of men who pretended to explain very clearly all kinds of Omens for a very &s;mall Matter; but being for the mo&s;t part mi&s;taken in their Conjectures, the People complain'd of them to the Prie&s;ts, who accu&s;ed them to the Viceroy as Guilty of a Capital Crime, for which the Viceroy Condemn'd them to Dye: And ever &s;ince the Prie&s;ts alone Challenge to them&s;elves the Priviledge, who &s;o explain all &s;orts of Omens, that they can never be convicted of Lying in what they Say: For either they pretend that their God is well-pleas'd, or that he is angry with &s;uch a Man, or that the Souls of &s;ome of his Deceas'd Relations want Money, or that in the &s;ame In&s;tant when they &s;aw &s;uch an Omen the Soul of &s;ome of his Relations was Transform'd into a Star; all which the People do ea&s;ily believe, who are therefore per&s;waded by
<PB N="250" REF="285">
the Prie&s;ts to acquaint them with all the Omens they meet with.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall briefly relate a Not|able Story concerning this Matter. A cer|tain Rich Countryman being much Ad|dicted to this kind of Super&s;tition, had us'd for a long time to con&s;ult the Prie&s;ts, who were wont very often to expound his Omens of the need &s;ome of his Rela|tions Souls &s;tood in of Money, becau&s;e he was Rich. The Countryman at la&s;t grew weary of &s;uch expen&s;ive Enquiries, and thought he had given Money enough to Re|deem all the Souls that belonged to the <HI>I&s;le,</HI> and therefore contriv'd a way to cheat the Prie&s;t: For which end he went and told him, that in the Morning he had &s;een in his Garden more then a 100 Birds Sing|ing, which after a &s;hort &s;tay Flew away: But the Prie&s;t told him, If the&s;e Birds had continued a Longer time in the Garden, then for certain the Souls of your Deceas'd Relations had been Transform'd into Stars, but their &s;udden departure Signified that they &s;till wanted &s;omething, which being Furni&s;h'd, then, &s;ays he you may &s;ee them, this night a&s;cending into Heaven; For which end you mu&s;t give me &s;o much Gold, &s;o much Rice, and &s;o much of other Commodities, and then you may remain two hours upon the Roof of the Hou&s;e, and
<PB N="251" REF="286">
you &s;hall &s;ee the Stars, as it were, moving them&s;elves, which are the Souls &s;ignified by the Birds you &s;aw in the Garden. The Country-man, tho' much again&s;t his Will, gave the Prie&s;t what he demanded, and perhaps did &s;till believe that there was &s;omething of Truth in what he &s;aid; and therefore he went up to the top of his Hou&s;e, and as the Prie&s;t had &s;aid, he &s;aw the Stars moving them&s;elves; but having continu'd there all night, he ob&s;erved a great Multi|tude of Stars thus moving: And this ob|&s;ervation he renew'd every night for a whole week, untill at la&s;t he recckoned more Stars thus moving, then the Number of Men who were known to be Dead in the whole I&s;land for the &s;pace of three Years amounted to: Whereupon he went to the Prie&s;t and told him of it, and the Prie&s;t, perceiving that he had detected the Im|po&s;ture, carried him before the chief Sacri|ficator, who carried them both before the High Prie&s;t, or their Pope, who upon hear|ing the whole matter condemned the Prie&s;t to perpetual Impri&s;onment, becau&s;e he had expo&s;s'd to the Country-man the Mi&s;tery of Transforming Souls into Stars, but con|demned the Country-man to death for not yeilding due Deference and Submi&s;&s;ion to the Prie&s;t; from whence every one may clear|ly perceive, what Tyranny the Prie&s;ts exer|ci&s;e
<PB N="252" REF="287">
over the common People, who are not permitted to declare Publickly any doubt they have even of tho&s;e things they know to be fal&s;e. I could add &s;everal other things to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, but that I think they will be Tedious to the Reader; as the Noi&s;e which is made by the Dogs when they Bark aloud or Houle, the Crowing of a Hen like a Cock, the time when the Serpents hi&s;s in the Fields, when the Bears do not go out of the Wood, when the Eagles &s;it upon &s;ome Turrets, Hou&s;es or Trees, all which are in|terpreted to be good or bad Omens. But I have &s;aid enough of the&s;e Fopperies.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. Of the Di&s;ea&s;es in <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> and their Cures.</HEAD>
<P>THe greate&s;t Di&s;ea&s;e to which the Na|tives are Subject is the Plague, which they believe does not proceed from Natural Cau&s;es, but from the common con&s;ent of the Sun Moon and Stars, who agree in &s;ending it for a Puni&s;hment to Men, and therefore they rather make u&s;e of Sacrifices than Medicins for the cure of it. This does not happen frequently, for
<PB N="253" REF="288">
'tis now 170 years, &s;ince there was a Pla|gue in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> if we may believe their written Books and Tradition. One Cu&s;tom they have during the time of the Plague which is very remarkable; They a&s;cend to the Tops of the Highe&s;t Mountains, that at other times are not Inhabited for the thinne&s;s of the Air, which is then accounted very whole&s;om; and there they &s;eek out a Fountain of Water, of which they drink to exce&s;s, Eating nothing but herbs and certain Fruits: And this they continue to do till they think that the Plague is cea&s;'d, and then every one returns to his own Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As to other Di&s;ea&s;es which are very com|mon here, as the Gout, the Tertian and Quartan Ague, they are not at all known there, yet they are &s;ometimes, but very &s;eldom, troubled with burning Fevers; at other times they have a pain in the Head or Stomach, but it la&s;ts not long. If at any time they find them&s;elves indi&s;|pos'd, or any Di&s;ea&s;e coming upon them, they commonly u&s;e this Method for a Cure. They run 2 or 3 Miles as &s;wiftly as they can, and in the mean time one prepares a Potion for him that runs, made of &s;ome Herbs and Roots, which he drinks off, after he has run his Race, while he is very hot, and Immediately goes to Bed,
<PB N="254" REF="289">
where he &s;weats till he has cured the Di&s;|ea&s;e. And be&s;ides, their temperate way of Living conduces very much either to pre|vent or cure their Di&s;ea&s;es, e&s;pecially when they take Tobacco, which purges the Head and Body of ill humours. Here in <HI>England</HI> the generality of People fre|quent Taverns or Alehou&s;es, and the con|&s;tant cu&s;tom of Drinking &s;uch Liquors as are &s;old there, proves prejudicial to the Health; but in <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> they commonly &s;pend their Idle hours, in Walking or Chat|ting together, and Smoking a Pipe of To|bacco; and if they drink any thing, it is only a di&s;h or two of <HI>Tea</HI> or <HI>Chila,</HI> which if it does not any good, at lea&s;t is no ways hurtful to the Health: And hence it comes to pa&s;s, that Men generally Live longer there than they do here, and are free from many di&s;ea&s;es to which <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are lia|ble. 'Tis a mi&s;take to think that the Air alone will pre&s;erve our Health, unle&s;s we be al&s;o Temperate in Eating and Drinking; And this I have found true by experience, that no di&s;tinction of Climates has ever deprav'd my Temper and Con&s;titution of Body, but by the help of Temperance I have &s;till pre&s;erved my Health, thanks be to God, not only in my own Country, but in all the other Countries thro' which I have Travelled. But to return to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ea&s;es
<PB N="255" REF="290">
of <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> the &s;mall Pox is very rife there, and &s;carce one e&s;capes them; but they have them commonly whil&s;t they are very young as in the 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> or 6<HI>th.</HI> Month, or the 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> or 2<HI>d.</HI> Year after they are Born, but they very &s;eldom have them after they are three Years old, neither do I remember that I have ever heard of one that died of that di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>After the Small-pox, there commonly Succeeds a certain Di&s;ea&s;e which we call <HI>Schimpyo</HI> which is only a Redne&s;s of the Fle&s;h, together with a great Internal heat: And the Infants which are troubled with this Di&s;ea&s;e run the hazard of Death, unle&s;s they be kept at a di&s;tance from a Serene Air, and mu&s;t live in places that are very warm until they be cur'd. But the&s;e 2 Di&s;ea&s;es Incident to Children la&s;t no longer then 3, or at mo&s;t 4 Weeks.</P>
<P>Colicks are al&s;o very frequent in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> in which the pain is &s;ometimes &s;o Into|lerable, that &s;ome kill them&s;elves, others Com|mand another to kill them.</P>
<P>Women in Child-bed are in great danger of Death. Which I think proceeds from want of Exerci&s;e, becau&s;e when they are with Child they never Stir out of the Chamber, but &s;it and Work there all the day long: Many of them die before they bring forth, or if they e&s;cape Death yet at lea&s;t they are Cruelly Tormented with
<PB N="256" REF="291">
pains, which &s;ome of them endure for a whole Month before they are brought to Bed.</P>
<P>Maids, for the mo&s;t part, when they come to be 18 or 20 years Old, are trou|bled with a certain Di&s;ea&s;e, which we call <HI>Chatarsko,</HI> and here in <HI>England</HI> is called the <HI>Green-&s;ickne&s;s,</HI> which makes them Me|lancholy, and de&s;troys all their appetite to any thing except Matrimony, corrupts the Blood, and makes them pale-colour'd. This Di&s;ea&s;e is peculiar to the Female Sex, for which there is no other Remedy but Marriage.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the Di&s;ea&s;es which I can Remember; but there may be others un|known to me. I will conclude with this General Ob&s;ervation, that both Men and Women, for the mo&s;t part, die rather of a great Old Age, than of any other pains, except in Child-bearing and fits of the Colick; and you may frequently &s;ee Men a 100 years Old, without Labouring un|der any grievous Di&s;ea&s;e. If any ask me whether there be any &s;uch thing as the French-pox there, I an&s;wer I never heard of any &s;uch Di&s;ea&s;e, and probably there is no &s;uch thing in <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>; becau&s;e they allow Polygamy and prohibit Adultery.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. Of the Revenues of the King, the Vice-Roy, the General of the Army, and of all others in high Places of Power and Tru&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THE King, be&s;ides the third part of the Gold and Silver dug out of the Mines, which is paid him by the Vice-Roy, as has been ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Chapter of Metals,</HI> receives al&s;o from the Empe|ror of <HI>Japan</HI> 400000 Copans; out of which Revenue he is to pay 15000 <HI>Japan</HI> Soldi|ers above mention'd, his own Guards, and to maintain the Port of his Court. The <HI>Caril|lan</HI> or General has every Year about 70000 Copans. The Vice-Roy has 168760 Copans; out of which he pays to the Gnotoy Bon|zo, or the High Prie&s;t, 50000 for him&s;elf: To the &s;even Gnotoi, Tarhadiazos, or chief Sacrificators 7700: To the four Governours of the four I&s;les 3600, <HI>viz.</HI> to each of them 900: To the &s;ix Governours of the &s;ix Cities 3000, <HI>viz.</HI> to each of them 500: To the &s;ix|teen Governours of the Villages and Towns 4000, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;ome of them 300, to others 250, and to others 200. But the

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. Of all the Fruits of the Ground.</HEAD>
<P>NO Corn, &s;uch as Wheat and Barley does grow in the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a</HI>; and the rea&s;on of it is this, becau&s;e the Sun being very hot, the Soil is &s;andy and dry, and &s;o the Grain is dry'd up, not having &s;ufficient moi&s;ture, before it is fully ripen'd: But in&s;tead of Corn they make u&s;e of Roots to make Bread withal. There are two Roots of which they make Bread, where|of one is call'd <HI>Chitok,</HI> and the other <HI>Mag|nok:</HI> Both the&s;e Roots are &s;own like Rape-Seed, and when they are grown ripe they are as big as a Man's Thigh. The&s;e Roots grow twice, and &s;ometimes thrice in a year, when it is a good &s;ea&s;on; and as &s;oon as they are fully ripe, they are cut off and laid in the Sun to be dried, and when they are dried they are cut in pieces and ground into a kind of Flower: And then this Flower being mix'd with Milk, Water, Sugar and Spices, is bak'd; and &s;o it makes a very good &s;ort of Bread, which is as white as Snow, and is call'd by the Natives <HI>Kahatzadao.</HI> They have Bread
<PB N="260" REF="295">
al&s;o made of Wheat, whichis brought thither from Foreign Parts; but that is too dear for the common &s;ort of People. They have a kind of Bread al&s;o made of Rice boil'd with Saffron, which Bread is like an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pudding, and is call'd by the Natives <HI>Kdekh</HI>; but this Bread will not keep like the former.</P>
<P>They have Vines al&s;o, and make Wine of the Grapes in &s;ome few places; but this Wine is not &s;o &s;weet as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine in <HI>Europe</HI>; from whence they have that and other Wines, and al&s;o Ale, brought thither by the <HI>Dutch</HI>; but they are very dear, and are not &s;o much lov'd by the Natives as they are by the <HI>Europeans.</HI> They have many other kinds of Drink, as <HI>Ar-mag|nok, Puntet, Charpok, Chilak, Caffe</HI> and <HI>Tea. Ar-magnok, i. e.</HI> the fellow of <HI>Mag|nok,</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e two are an agree|able mixture for health, which Liquor is made after this manner. They boil a great quantity of Rice in &s;pring-Water till it grows very thick, and then they make Balls of it as big as a Man's Fi&s;t, which they dry in the Sun, and then boil them in fre&s;h &s;pring-Water; and when it is boil'd enough, they put it into great earthen Ve&s;&s;els, and let it ferment, and after that, it is as &s;trong or rather &s;tronger than <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer; and the longer
<PB N="261" REF="296">
it is kept the &s;tronger it grows. <HI>Puntet</HI> is a Liquor that runs from &s;ome Trees, which they tap at a certain &s;ea&s;on of the Year: And the Liquor that comes from them they receive into Ve&s;&s;els, and mix it with Sugar, and then having kept it for &s;ome time, it has the &s;ame ta&s;te as &s;oft Ale made of Oat-Malt. <HI>Charpok</HI> is the name of the Fruit of a Tree, and of the Liquor that comes out of it: The Trees is like a Wall|nut Tree, but in this differs from all other Trees, that whereas their Fruit hangs downward, the Fruit of this &s;tands up|right. The Fruit in &s;hape and bigne&s;s re|&s;embles a Gourd, and when it is ripe, it is cut off and pierc'd through, that the Liquor may run out of it, which is very &s;trong; for if it be not pre&s;s'd, the Li|quor is more intoxicating than di&s;tilled Waters, or Brandy-Wine. <HI>Chilak</HI> is a kind of a Powder made like Coffee, and is boil'd after the &s;ame manner, either with Milk or Water; but in this it differs from Coffee, that it may be drunk cold, where|as Coffee is always drunk hot. <HI>Tea</HI> and <HI>Coffee</HI> are of the &s;ame &s;ort, and the Li|quors are made after the &s;ame manner there as every-where el&s;e. Be&s;ides the&s;e Liquors they have many others &s;orts: Such are the <HI>Bullan,</HI> which is made of Apples and Pears, or of Oranges and Lemmons,
<PB N="262" REF="297">
and another Liquor, which is made like the <HI>Orgeat</HI> of the &s;ame Materials: And la&s;tly, they who can get no other Liquor drink Milk and Water.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all &s;orts of Fruits which are to be found here in <HI>England,</HI> as Apples, Pears, Cherries, Nuts, Plums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they have many other things, &s;uch as Oranges, Lem|mons, Sugar in great quantities, and Spices, as Pepper, Cinamon, Cloves, Nutmegs, Tea, Coco's, Coffee, and the like, which are either wholly wanting here, or at lea&s;t grow very rarely in <HI>England.</HI> Their Trees bear twice in a Year, and the Fig-tree three or four times: And the&s;e Fruits ye have here of the &s;ame kind with theirs, are not half &s;o good or &s;o great, or &s;o well-ta&s;ted; &s;o that the Ground there &s;eems to have a peculiar virtue for ripening and improving the Fruit, which here it has not. As for in&s;tance, ye have here the &s;ame &s;ort of Trees, which are there call'd <HI>Puniet</HI>; but pierce the&s;e Trees here when you will, and ye will find they will not run the 20th part of the Liquor which they yield there, neither is it &s;o well-ta&s;ted.

They commonly eat the Fle&s;h of Veni&s;on and of Fowls raw: And, which may &s;eem &s;trange here in <HI>England,</HI> they eat Serpents al&s;o, which they look upon as very good Meat and very &s;avoury, being broil'd up|on the Coals: But before they eat them, they take care to extract all the Poi&s;on out of them, which they do after this man|ner: They take them when they are alive
<PB N="264" REF="299">
and beat them with Rods until they be very angry; and when they are in this furious pa&s;&s;ion, all the Venom that was in the Body a&s;cends to the Head, which be|ing then cut off, there remains no more Poi&s;on in the Body, which may therefore be &s;afely eaten.

added, and the &s;ame elevation and falling of the Voice is ob&s;erv'd as in the preterit. The future Ten&s;e of <HI>Jerh Chato</HI> is pronoun|ced by falling the Voice in the fir&s;t Syl|lable, and rai&s;ing it in the re&s;t; and the <HI>paulo po&s;t futurum</HI> is pronounced after the &s;ame manner, only adding the Verb <HI>Viar,</HI> as <HI>Jerh viar Chato, ego ero amo.</HI> But the <HI>Ja|panne&s;e</HI> &s;ay, <HI>Jerh Chato, Jerh Chataye, Jerh Chatar,</HI> pronouncing the auxiliary Verb always after the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japan</HI> Language has three Genders; all &s;orts of Animals are either of the Ma&s;|culine or Feminine Gender, and all inani|mate Creatures are of the Neuter: But the Gender is only known by the Articles, <HI>e. g. oi hic, ey haec,</HI> and <HI>ay hoc</HI>; but in the Plural number all the three Articles are alike.</P>
<P>They have no Ca&s;es, and they u&s;e only the &s;ingular and plural Number, but not the Dual: As for example, <HI>oi banajo, hic ho|mo, os banajos, hi homines.</HI> But &s;ince I do not intend to write a Grammar of the Language, but only to give &s;ome Idea of it, it may be &s;ufficient to add this general Ob|&s;ervation. That it is very ea&s;y, &s;ounds mu|&s;ically, and is very copious. If any one &s;hall ask from what Language it is deriv'd? I an&s;wer, That I know of no other Lan|guage, except that of <HI>Japan,</HI> that has any great affinity with it; but I find many
<PB N="268" REF="303">
Words in it which &s;eem to be deriv'd from &s;everal other Languages, only chang|ing either the &s;ignification or termina|tion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> wrote formerly in a &s;ort of Characters mo&s;t like tho&s;e of the <HI>Chine|&s;es</HI>; but &s;ince they have held corre&s;pon|dence with the <HI>Formo&s;ans,</HI> they have ge|nerally made u&s;e of their way of writing, as more ea&s;y and more beautiful; in&s;omuch that there are few now in <HI>Japan</HI> who un|der&s;tand the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Characters.</P>
<P>But here it is to be noted, that the &s;ame Prophet <HI>P&s;almanaazar,</HI> who delivered the Law to the <HI>Formo&s;ans,</HI> did al&s;o teach them this way of writing, as is commonly be|liev'd.</P>
<P>They u&s;e only twenty Letters in their Language, which are to be read from the right Hand to the left; who&s;e Names and Figures are as follows.</P>

<P>The rea&s;on why the <HI>Japan</HI> Language differs from that of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and <HI>For|mo&s;ans,</HI> is this, becau&s;e the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> be|ing bani&s;h'd from <HI>China,</HI> &s;etled in the I&s;les of <HI>Japan</HI>; upon which account they &s;o much hate the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> that they have chang'd all things they had in common

<P>EVery one I think knows that the <HI>Ja|panne&s;e</HI> u&s;e no &s;uch Arms as are com|monly us'd here in <HI>Europe:</HI> But after the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> came there, they gave them &s;ome Guns and Muskets, which are not &s;o many as to be &s;erviceable to them in making War again&s;t their Enemies, but are laid up and kept as Curio&s;ities to be &s;hewn. The warlike In&s;truments which they make u&s;e of, are as follows.</P>

<P>They make <HI>Swords</HI> and <HI>Daggers</HI> &s;o won|derfully fine, that they are highly e&s;teem|ed in all the Ea&s;tern Countries.

<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that the Art of Mu&s;ick was not known for many Years in any of the Ea&s;tern Countries, neither had they any certain method of &s;inging and playing upon In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick, though they had then &s;uch as re&s;embled the <HI>Drum</HI> and the <HI>Tabor,</HI> the <HI>Trumpet</HI> and <HI>Flagellet,</HI> the <HI>Lute</HI> and <HI>Harp:</HI> But &s;ince the time that the <HI>Europeans</HI> came thither, they have learn'd the way of making and u&s;ing the&s;e In&s;truments, which are now made almo&s;t after the &s;ame fa&s;hion as they are here in <HI>England:</HI> For when they heard the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> play upon the <HI>Organs</HI> in their Churches, and &s;ing Mu&s;ically after the manner of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, they were mightily taken with it, and inflam'd with a de&s;ire of learning the Art of Mu&s;ick, which now by their indu&s;try and ingenui|ty they have attained, tho' not in perfecti|on, yet to &s;uch a degree as wonderfully plea&s;es them&s;elves; and therefore they commonly u&s;e both vocal and in&s;trumen|tal Mu&s;ick at their Marriages, Funerals,
<PB N="285" REF="324">
Sports and Recreations; and at their of|fering Sacrifices, chiefly when they Sacri|fice Infants.</P>
<P>Thus it is in <HI>Japan</HI>; but in the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> the Natives &s;till ob&s;erve their ancient method of &s;inging and playing up|on Mu&s;ical In&s;truments, if their way of &s;ing|ing may be call'd a method; for except &s;ome few particular Prayers, which are &s;ung by the Prie&s;ts only, the People &s;ing all other things, every one after a different man|ner, according to his fancy; which they do not look upon as ridiculous, becau&s;e they know no better; but on the contrary the different voices and tones, which every one u&s;es at plea&s;ure, &s;eems to them to make a plea&s;ant harmony.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII. Of the way of Educating their Children.</HEAD>
<P>I Have already &s;aid, that every Wife takes care of her own Children, but if &s;he be the Wife of a Nobleman, &s;he has Ser|vant-Maids to look after them. They be|gin to teach a Child to read at three Years of age, and &s;ome of them will both read and write very well when they come to be five Years old; and from five to eight they in&s;truct them in the Principles of Religion and Morality, and teach them how to behave them&s;elves in company: After eight they &s;end them to the Schools or Academies, which they do not before that time, becau&s;e they think their Un|der&s;tanding is not ripe enough to appre|hend &s;uch things as are taught there, tho' many of them go to Schools before they are &s;even Years of age. The Mothers take a great deal of care in their Education, and their Fathers often examine them what
<PB N="287" REF="326">
progre&s;s they have made in their Learning: But their Parents never beat them, which they think improper, even when it may &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to reform their manners, and deter them from the Vices to which they are addicted, (much le&s;s do they u&s;e &s;uch imprecations upon them as &s;ome <HI>Europeans</HI> do upon their Children,) but they in&s;truct them the more carefully in their Duty, admoni&s;h them of their Faults, and by the mo&s;t winning Per&s;ua&s;ives exhort them to amend; for they hope that as their Rea|&s;on encrea&s;es with their Years, they will of them&s;elves abandon their Vices. And indeed this gentle method of Admonition and Exhortation does commonly prove &s;o effectual, that young Men of &s;ix or nine Years of age will behave them&s;elves with as much civility and mode&s;ty in their Di&s;cour&s;es and Ge&s;tures as an old Man can do, which de&s;erves no &s;mall admira|tion.</P>
<P>They have a very &s;harp natural Wit, which readily learns the Languages and li|beral Arts: And if any one think that I boa&s;t too much of my Countrymen, they may read the Account that is given of them in the Relations of &s;everal Au|thors.</P>
<P>When they are arriv'd at the fifth or &s;ixth Year of age, then their Parents &s;end
<PB N="288" REF="327">
them to the School, and after that tho' they be negligent in their Studies, they never force them by threats to do any thing to mind their Book, but encourage them by good Words and fair Promi&s;es, and by propo&s;ing to them the Examples of others, either real or feign'd, who by im|provement in their Studies have arriv'd at great Honours and Dignities; and by the&s;e and &s;uch-like means they prevail more over the Youth, than they could by blows and menaces; for to &s;peak the Truth, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that the Natives of <HI>Ja|pan</HI> and <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> are naturally &s;o &s;tubborn and &s;urly, that they cannot endure blows; and hence it often happens, that Servants when they are unde&s;ervedly and unmer|cifully beaten, will in revenge kill their Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The Infants of Noblemen are carefully tended, and very carefully brought up by their Mothers and Nur&s;es, who con&s;tantly attend them to &s;ee that they want for no|thing, and cover them with Silk or Cotton to keep them warm; but never wrap them in &s;wadling Cloths as they <HI>Euro|peans</HI> do: But their Country People are carele&s;s in cloathing their Children, and keeping them warm while they are In|fants; and when they come to be two Years old, they &s;uffer them to run na|ked

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII. Of the Liberal and Mechanical Art in <HI>Japan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Though the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> are inferiour to the <HI>Europeans</HI> in the Knowledge of the liberal Arts, yet this mu&s;t be &s;aid for them, that as to all Arts whether Liberal or Mechanical, they excel all the other Ea|&s;tern People. And though the Je&s;uits do mightily extol the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> above all the other <HI>Orientali&s;ts</HI> for their Ingenuity, yet I think they are much inferiour to the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> in &s;agacity and &s;harpne&s;s of Wit: for many of them, chiefly the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> &s;pend their whole Life in &s;tudying; but their Wit for the mo&s;t part con&s;i&s;ts in Riddles, Paradoxes and dark-&s;ayings. They write many Books of Theology, which are chiefly de&s;ign'd for the explication of their Articles of Re|ligion, and the defence of their Idolatrous Wor&s;hip: And in all their Meditations they chiefly apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of Philo&s;ophy, which with them is no|thing
<PB N="290" REF="329">
el&s;e, but a collection of the Opinions of all the ancient Philo&s;ophers they know, which favour their own Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>Altho' the <HI>Bonzii</HI> are bound to mini&s;ter in holy Things, and by their office are pe|culiarly &s;et apart for that &s;ervice, yet they do not only &s;tudy Philo&s;ophy and Theo|logy, but Mathematicks, Medicine and Law; &s;o that their Academies &s;eem to re&s;emble Univer&s;ities here in teaching all the liberal Sciences. They teach al&s;o the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue in the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> and every one may learn it in their Academies, who has Money enough to pay the Prie&s;ts; but the <HI>Japan Bonzii</HI> teach it only among them&s;elves, but not to the Laity.</P>
<P>The&s;e Colleges in which the Youth are taught, are endow'd with great Revenues; for all Princes, Noblemen and Gentlemen, &s;end their Sons thither, and give great Gifts to them.</P>
<P>As to the Law, they have no Rules, but &s;uch as are di&s;cover'd by natural Light, or the dictates of Rea&s;on, or are founded up|on the Authority of their Superiours, who&s;e Will is a Law to their Subjects: Thus the An&s;wer of the Prince decides any Controver&s;ie, and puts an end to the Suit of the contending Parties. But, as we have before ob&s;erv'd, <HI>Meriandanoo</HI> made new Laws to re&s;train the Kings and
<PB N="291" REF="330">
Princes from en&s;laving their Subjects &s;o much as they were wont to do.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians and Chyrurgeons in <HI>For|mo&s;a</HI> are very ignorant and unskilful, tho' they are very much honoured by all &s;orts of People. They know nothing of the art of Mu&s;ick, as has been before ob&s;erv'd: But as to the other liberal Arts, all the Sons of Citizens and Gentlemen &s;tudy them in their Academies, provided their Fa|thers have &s;ufficient means to maintain them there. They are excellent at making Ver&s;es, but chiefly the <HI>Bonzii</HI> in the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> who do not only compo&s;e Prayers, but al&s;o Sermons in Ver&s;e. They mighti|ly affect Brevity in all their Writings, and labour only to expre&s;s in a few Words the &s;ub&s;tance of any matter of fact, without taking notice of many Circum&s;tances which &s;et off the Hi&s;tory: And therefore when they write Libels to any Prince, they con|trive them wonderful &s;hort, yet &s;o that nothing which is pertinent to the matter or &s;ub&s;tance of the Libel is omitted. Some of them are great lovers of Eloquence, but chiefly the <HI>Bonzii,</HI> and practi&s;e it very much in their Sermons, the better to move the Affections of their Hearers, and per|&s;uade them to do what they have a mind to.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="331">The <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> did formerly write from the top down the bottom: Which way of writing they learn'd from the &s;hape of a Man, who&s;e Head is the highe&s;t part, and the Feet the lowe&s;t. But after that <HI>Meri|andanoo</HI> had once obtain'd the I&s;le <HI>For|mo&s;a,</HI> and annex'd it to the Empire of <HI>Ja|pan,</HI> the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> &s;eeing the way of wri|ting that was us'd by the <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> to be much better and more ea&s;y, have ever &s;ince continued to write after that man|ner: And this they do &s;o generally, that none but the <HI>Bonzii</HI> under&s;tand the an|cient way of writing; for the re&s;t are al|together ignorant of it.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have treated of their liberal Arts, I &s;hall only add a few Words of their mechanical Arts. The <HI>Formo&s;ans</HI> have Painters who draw fine Pictures with great Art and Skill; and their Engravers are very famous for working both in Wood and Stone. They have al&s;o Potters, who are very curious in making Di&s;hes, which they call <HI>Porcellane,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h China</HI>-Ware; and 'tis very well known, that in this Art they excel the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and all the oriental People. But they have no Shoe-makers, Brewers or Bakers there; neither do they know the way of making Candles as you do here; but in&s;tead of them they u&s;e Lamps, with Oil, Links and Torches,
<PB N="293" REF="332">
made of the Pine-tree; and the Country People kindle Straw, or any kind of Wood which will flame and give light. The art of making Gla&s;s is not known over all the Ea&s;t, and when it was fir&s;t brought to <HI>Japan,</HI> it appear'd to the Natives &s;o ad|mirable for its clearne&s;s and tran&s;parency, that the Mariners would &s;ell a piece of Gla&s;s worth no more than a penny here for half a Copan; but now &s;ince Ships have frequently arriv'd in the&s;e parts, the value of them is very much fallen; and yet they co&s;t twenty times more there than here. Some Noblemen have Gla&s;s-Win|dows in their Hou&s;es, but the&s;e co&s;t &s;o much that they are very rare, for the ge|nerality of the Natives u&s;e a thin waxen Silk-&s;tuff, or Paper made of Silk, for their Windows, which they receive from the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> Their chief Arts are the Pot|ters art, and the art of working with the Needle, in which they are ingenious to admiration: But above all they excel in the art of purging and preparing Metals, as has been ob&s;erv'd in the Chapter of their Arms. And la&s;tly, their Husbandmen are skilful enough in ordering and improving the Ground, according to the nature of the Soil.</P>
<P>And here it is to be noted, that all Ar|tificers, and &s;uch as get their livelihood by
<PB N="294" REF="333">
their labour, are very little e&s;teemed: And the Merchants the richer they are, are &s;o much the le&s;s valued, becau&s;e they believe they mu&s;t u&s;e many Lyes in commending and putting off their Merchandize, to en|crea&s;e their Gain and Riches: And be|cau&s;e the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> abhor a Lye, there|fore they de&s;pi&s;e the Merchants, whom they look upon as great Lyars; as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> de&s;pi&s;e the Mountebanks, who tell many Lyes of the Operations of their Medicines, which they &s;ell upon a Stage. I &s;hall only add, that as to other Me|chanical Arts which are us'd here in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Natives are always learning &s;ome|thing new from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> having a very &s;harp Wit, which ea&s;ily apprehends any Arts they once &s;ee.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV. Of the Splendid Retinue that attends the Vice-Roy of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> when he goes to wait upon the Emperor.</HEAD>
<P>SInce all Kings have not the &s;ame Dig|nity and Revenues, but &s;ome are more, &s;ome le&s;s rich and honourable, therefore every one of the King's Subject to the Em|peror of <HI>Japan,</HI> hath a Retinue propor|tionable to his Dignity. But the King of the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> being &s;ent from the Em|peror, is therefore always attended by the Vice-Roy and Carillan when he goes to wait upon the Emperor. 'Tis the office of the Carillan to give the Emperor that account of the I&s;le which is made by the King; and the Vice-Roy relates as from him&s;elf the &s;ame things which the King relates by the Carillan, <HI>viz.</HI> all things which concern the Government, the Sub|jects or the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roy of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> does u&s;ually travel twice a-Year to wait upon the Em|peror of <HI>Japan</HI>; and then he has his own Balcon, which has been before de&s;crib'd, and thirty &s;ix Balcons of the Noblemen,
<PB N="296" REF="335">
who attend him: But the Carillan travels in the &s;ame Balcon with the King, as be|ing his Companion. Be&s;ides the&s;e Bal|cons there are eighty floating Villages, in which are the Guards of the Vice-Roy and Carillan, and the Litters or Palan|quins, in which they travel when they pa&s;s through the I&s;land. All things are &s;et in order when they come to the I&s;le <HI>Xyphon</HI>; forty floating Villages go before, and eighteen Balcons of Noblemen, then comes the Balcons of the Vice-Roy, and after it eighteen Balcons of Noblemen, and la&s;t of all forty floating Villages, whereof one or two belongs to each Nobleman.</P>
<P>In this order they make their Progre&s;s till they come to the Sea-Port Town, where they are to Land, and then they all go out, and Noblemen go into the Lit|ters which are carried a&s;hore for them, and the Balcons remain there till the Vice-Roy returns. There are thirty-&s;ix Litters which belong to the Noblemen, who ac|company the Vice-Roy, and there is one for the Vice-Roy, with whom the Caril|lan travels to bear him Company. All the Litters of the Nobility are an Ell and a half in height and length, and are made of Wood, curiou&s;ly adorn'd within and
<PB N="297" REF="336">
without with Silks and Tape&s;try, finely wrought with the Needle, with plates of Bra&s;s or Copper, and many Pictures, and are u&s;ually carried by two Elephants.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roy and Carillan travel in one Litter, which is two Ells and a half high, and three Ells long, and is carried by two Elephants: Inwardly it is adorn'd with Silks and Cloth of Gold, finely wrought with the Needle; and outwardly it is co|vered with mo&s;t pure Gold. In this Lit|ter, be&s;ides the Vice-Roy and Carillan, are one Nobleman and ten Ladies of Ho|nour, which are branches of the King's Fa|mily: It goes in the middle of all the other Litters, and is guarded with Soldiers be|fore and behind, and on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>All things being thus di&s;pos'd, they enter into the Emperor's Palace, where they con|tinue for a Month, and then return into their own Country. The Emperor does them this Honour, as to &s;end twenty of his Courtiers to receive them when they land at the Sea-Port Town, and as many to accompany them, in Litters guarded with Soldiers, when they return to the Sea-Port. And during all the time they &s;tay at the Emperor's Court, he puts all kinds of Ho|nour upon them; for he diverts them with Hunting, Sports and Comedies, and ad|mits them to a hearing every Day for an
<PB N="298" REF="337">
Hour in a publick A&s;&s;embly: And la&s;tly, when they are to go away, he loads them with Gifts, and very honourably takes a farewel of them.</P>
<P>'Tis a part of the Office of the King of <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> to accompany the Vice-Roy to the Sea-Port Town call'd <HI>Khad&s;ey,</HI> where he takes Shipping, and to receive him at the &s;ame place when he returns, and attend him as far as the Ca&s;tle.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV. Of the Succe&s;s of the Je&s;uits in pro|pagating the Chri&s;tian Faith in <HI>Ja|pan,</HI> from <HI>1549</HI> to <HI>1615.</HI> More e&s;pecially of the Rea&s;ons of the ter|rible Slaughter that was made of them about the Year <HI>1616.</HI> And of the Law prohibiting Chri&s;tians un|der pain of Death to come into <HI>Japan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SInce my de&s;ign is only to give an Ac|count of the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> and to touch upon the Affairs of <HI>Japan</HI> &s;o far as they have Relation to it; I &s;hall not pretend to give a particular Hi&s;tory of the various &s;ucce&s;s the Je&s;uits met with in propagating the Chri&s;tian Religion through the &s;eve|ral Kingdoms of <HI>Japan,</HI> of which I have receiv'd no certain information. But in general I am very well a&s;&s;ur'd, by the con|&s;tant uncontroll'd Tradition of my Coun|trymen; that notwith&s;tanding all the dif|ficulties they met with, they made a won|derful progre&s;s in the conver&s;ion of that Empire between the Year 1549. in which <HI>Xaverius</HI> &s;ays he, fir&s;t arriv'd at <HI>Cangoxima,</HI> and the Year 1616 or thereabout; for 'tis commonly believ'd in <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> that in this
<PB N="300" REF="339">
&s;pace of time more than a third part of <HI>Japan</HI> was converted to the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion; and <HI>Tampou&s;amma</HI> him&s;elf, who was Emperor of <HI>Japan</HI> in the &s;aid Year 1616.</P>
<P>Though many other cau&s;es might con|cur to promote the &s;preading of the Chri&s;ti|an Religion in <HI>Japan</HI> by the Je&s;uits, of which I can give no particular account, yet I am very certainly inform'd that one thing which contributed very much to the propagation of it, was their propo&s;ing the Chri&s;tian Religion, after &s;uch a man|ner as was mo&s;t agreeable to natural Rea|&s;on, and the Doctrines and Practices com|monly receiv'd among the <HI>Japanne&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Je&s;uits taught them in their fir&s;t Lectures, That there was but one God, the Creator and Governour of all things in Heaven and Earth, and demon&s;trated his Eternity and other Attributes by natu|ral Rea&s;on; but &s;aid nothing of a Trinity of Per&s;ons in the Unity of the God-head, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;hock their Belief of the one true God. And as to Chri&s;t, they affirm'd that he was a Divine Vertue re&s;iding in a human Body, or a mighty Hero &s;ent from God to reveal his Mind and Will to Mankind; and they enlarged upon the Holine&s;s of his Life, the Rea&s;onable|ne&s;s and Excellency of his Doctrine, the many Miracles he wrought for confirma|tion
<PB N="301" REF="340">
of it, and the bitter and painful Death he endur'd on the Cro&s;s for the ex|piation of the Sins of Mankind: All which were agreeable enough to the opi|nions the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> had conceiv'd of their pretended Heroes, That they had done many wonderful Feats, and endur'd great and la&s;ting Pains to deliver their Follow|ers from future Torments. But all this while the Je&s;uits &s;aid nothing of his be|ing God and Man in one Per&s;on, but con|ceal'd that My&s;tery, as being too difficult for the apprehen&s;ion of the <HI>Japanne&s;e,</HI> un|til a more convenient opportunity.</P>
<P>They taught the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> to wor&s;hip the only true God, and his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who was rais'd from the Dead by the Almighty Power of God, and a&s;cend|ed into Heaven, and was exalted in the humane Nature to all Power in Heaven and Earth, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve his faith|ful Servants; which was agreeable enough to the notions they had of their Deified Men, &s;uch as <HI>Xaca</HI> and <HI>Amida,</HI> to whom they pray'd for Relief in all their Straits and Nece&s;&s;ities. And as to the Wor&s;hip of Images and Saints departed, there was &s;uch a perfect Harmony between the Je|&s;uits and the <HI>Japanne&s;e,</HI> That they de&s;ir'd them only to change their Idols for the Images of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="341">
and other Saints of the only true God, and to continue the &s;ame way of wor&s;hip|ping and tru&s;ting to the Saints, as Inter|ce&s;&s;ors with God for them, but not to offer Sacrifices to them.</P>
<P>They admini&s;tred Bapti&s;m in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Gho&s;t, as the Rite of admitting Men into the Chri&s;tian Church, and never declared the Holy Gho&s;t to be a Divine Per&s;on in the ever-ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, but repre&s;ented him as the Power of God.</P>
<P>They admini&s;tred the Lord's Supper in commemoration of the Death of Chri&s;t, but never offer'd to explain the My&s;tery of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, or the Sacrifice of the Me&s;s.</P>
<P>And by this way of repre&s;enting the Chri&s;tian Religion, and concealing tho&s;e My&s;teries which are more difficult to be ap|prehended and believ'd, and the peculiar Ab&s;urdities of the Popi&s;h Doctrines, it ap|pear'd to contain nothing but what was agreeable to natural Rea&s;on, and the Noti|ons and Practices commonly receiv'd among the <HI>Japanne&s;e,</HI> and &s;o it ea&s;ily gain'd credit and &s;pread mightily among the ingenious <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI>; e&s;pecially being recommended by &s;ome peculiar advantages it has above all other Religions, as particularly by the full a&s;&s;urance it gives of a future &s;tate of eternal Life and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="342">But as this Artifice gain'd the Je&s;uits ma|ny Followers, while they conceal'd the afore&s;aid Doctrines, which they did for many Years, until they found their Party very &s;trong and powerful: So when they declar'd them to the People, and impos'd them as nece&s;&s;ary Articles of Faith, the Chri&s;tian Converts murmur'd again&s;t them for changing the Religion they had for|merly taught; and the <HI>Pagans,</HI> but e&s;peci|ally the <HI>Bonzies</HI> exclaim'd again&s;t them as Impo&s;tors, for deceiving the People with new Devices, which occa&s;ion'd many to make defection from them, and rais'd in all a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion of their In&s;incerity: So that this Declaration of the&s;e new Doctrines prov'd very much to their di&s;|advantage, and may be reckon'd one cau&s;e of their utter Ruin and Extirpation.</P>
<P>A &s;econd Cau&s;e was the great Envy and Indignation which all the <HI>Pagans,</HI> but chiefly the <HI>Bonzies,</HI> conceiv'd again&s;t the Je&s;uits, becau&s;e they in&s;inuated them&s;elves &s;o far into the favour of Kings and Prin|ces, and all the rich Men who were Con|verts to their Religion, that they &s;etled great Revenues upon the Chri&s;tian Mona|&s;teries, which us'd formerly to be given to the <HI>Bonzies</HI>; nay, the Fathers di&s;inhe|rited their Sons to enrich their Mona&s;te|ries, which &s;o exa&s;perated the Minds of
<PB N="304" REF="343">
the <HI>Pagans</HI> again&s;t them, that they endea|voured by all means to extirpate them.</P>
<P>A third Cau&s;e was the di&s;covery of a Con&s;piracy, carried on by the Je&s;uits, to betray the Empire of <HI>Japan</HI> into the Hands of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>; for which end they had &s;ent him Letters, which were found out, giving him an account of the &s;itua|tion of their Harbours, and of their &s;e|veral Cities, Ca&s;tles and Forts, and the manner how they might be be&s;ieg'd and taken. The Je&s;uits confe&s;s, that the great Dominions which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> gave the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> a great Umbrage; and this they &s;ay mov'd them to &s;et on foot a de|&s;ign of aboli&s;hing their Religion, and dri|ving them out of their Country: But they deny that they ever wrote &s;uch Letters to that King, giving him an account of the Strength of the <HI>Japan</HI> Empire, and the ways of attacking it; and pretend that the&s;e Letters were forged by the <HI>Hollan|ders,</HI> on purpo&s;e to render the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> odious, and get their Trade in <HI>Japan</HI> out of their Hands. But this Forgery was ne|ver prov'd again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI>; and there|fore 'tis commonly believ'd in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> that the Je&s;uits were the Authors and Con|trivers of the afore&s;aid Letters, which mu&s;t certainly render them very odious to all the <HI>Pigans.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="344">But all the&s;e three Cau&s;es were only preparatory to that which follows, which was the la&s;t and immediate Cau&s;e of the great &s;laughter of the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Japan.</HI> For the better under&s;tanding of which we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that in the great progre&s;s which the Chri&s;tian Religion had made in <HI>Japan,</HI> by the preaching of the Je&s;uits and other Mi&s;&s;ionaries of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, there were not only &s;everal Kings and Princes and many great Lords, but al&s;o an Emperor who had em|braced Chri&s;tianity, who&s;e name was <HI>Tampou&s;ama</HI>; and he gave them not only a Toleration, but all manner of Encouragement to propagate and &s;ettle their Religion in all parts of the Empire. The Je&s;uits being puffed up with this &s;uc|ce&s;s, and &s;upported by &s;o great an Autho|rity, ventur'd boldly to expo&s;e their pe|culiar <HI>Dogmata</HI> of <HI>Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,</HI> and the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the <HI>Me&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. which they required all the Chri&s;tians to believe, un|der pain of Damnation; and to u&s;e all the pious Frauds they could invent, for drain|ing the Riches of <HI>Japan</HI> into their own Coffers. And having by this means given great offence to the Chri&s;tians, and in|curr'd the great hatred of the <HI>Pagans,</HI> and rai&s;ed a vehement &s;u&s;picion in all &s;orts of People of their being Impo&s;tors; they
<PB N="306" REF="345">
began to be afraid, le&s;t the <HI>Pagans</HI> &s;hould con&s;pire together to work their Ruin, and therefore were re&s;olv'd to be beforehand with them, and to take the &s;horte&s;t way for converting the whole Em|pire to their Religion.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e they forg'd a Lye, which they went and told the Emperor, That the <HI>Pagans</HI> were contriving to rai&s;e a Rebel|lion again&s;t him, and to cut the Throats of all the Chri&s;tians. That they had al|ready had &s;everal Con&s;ultations about car|rying on this wicked Con&s;piracy, which they would certainly put in execution, un|le&s;s they were timely prevented. The Em|peror who look'd upon them as very wi&s;e Men, and put an entire confidence in them, asked them, what they would have him to do? To which they readily an&s;wered, That to &s;ecure him&s;elf and the Chri&s;tians from this Con&s;piracy, he could do nothing better, than to &s;end his Letters to all the Chri&s;tian Churches, requiring the Chri&s;ti|ans every-where throughout the Empire, to ri&s;e up in Arms on &s;uch a Day, about a certain Hour of the Night, and kill all the <HI>Pagans:</HI> For by this means, continued they, the wicked De&s;ign again&s;t your Ma|je&s;ty and the Chri&s;tians will be prevented, and the Chri&s;tian Faith alone will flouri&s;h through all your Empire, and there will
<PB N="307" REF="346">
be none left alive to trouble you, or di&s;turb the Peace of your Government. Be&s;ides, the better to excite the Emperor to this undertaking, they a&s;&s;ur'd him that he was oblig'd to do it, not only in point of Po|licy, but of Religion, becau&s;e this would be &s;uch a commendable and meritorious Work, to extirpate Heatheni&s;m and &s;ettle Chri&s;tianity in all his Dominions, that he might certainly expect the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, and of Chri&s;t upon him&s;elf, and all his Chri&s;tian Subjects, for fini&s;hing &s;uch a glorious De&s;ign. But, added they, if you delay much longer to put it in execution, you will certainly find by woful experi|ence, that your Maje&s;ty and all the Chri|&s;tians will be murther'd in one Night; the con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be the utter Extirpation of Chri&s;tianity in <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things they repre&s;ented with &s;o much &s;eeming Zeal and affectionate Con|cern for the Chri&s;tian Religion, that the Emperor was prevail'd upon, as is com|monly reported, to grant them his Letters to be &s;ent to all the Chri&s;tians, requiring them to de&s;troy all the <HI>Pagans</HI> in his Do|minions; though others &s;ay that the Je|&s;uits pre&s;um'd &s;o far upon the Emperor's good Affection to their Cau&s;e, that they wrote the&s;e Letters in the Emperor's Name without his Knowledge, and di&s;patch'd
<PB N="308" REF="347">
them to all the Chri&s;tian Churches. How|ever this is certain, that all the Churches receiv'd Orders written in the Emperor's Name, to ri&s;e up in Arms on &s;uch a Day, at &s;uch an Hour of the Night, and de&s;troy all the <HI>Pagans.</HI> And though this De&s;ign was managed with all the Artifice of the Je&s;uits&punc; to conceal it until the time of execution, yet they could not carry it on &s;o &s;ecretly but the <HI>Pagans</HI> came by &s;ome means or other to hear of it, time enough to prevent the fatal Blow: For either the Chri&s;tians, who had Fathers or Mothers, or other near Relations that were <HI>Pagans,</HI> out of natural Affection to them, di&s;co|ver'd the Plot, that they might have an opportunity to &s;ave their Lives; or others being touch'd with an Horror of the Bloody Con&s;piracy again&s;t their Countrymen and Friends, found their good Nature too hard for their Religion; and therefore gave timely notice to the <HI>Pagan</HI> Kings and Princes to fortify them&s;elves again&s;t the intended Ma&s;&s;acre: Which they did &s;o effectually, that having got all things ready, they ro&s;e up in Arms with their <HI>Pagan</HI> Sub|jects on the very Day before that in which the Chri&s;tians were to put their De&s;ign in execution, and fell upon them, and de|&s;troy'd them with a very great &s;laughter where&s;oever any Chri&s;tians could be found.
<PB N="309" REF="348">
The Emperor being a Chri&s;tian, and ha|ving too much countenanced the Je&s;uits in their intended Ma&s;&s;acre, was forc'd by the <HI>Pagans</HI> to leave his own Dominions, and went into the City of <HI>Goa,</HI> where he died, and his Body is &s;till pre&s;erved in the Church of the Je&s;uits, where a &s;tately Monument is erected to his Memory, with an In&s;cription to this purpo&s;e, <HI>Here lies</HI> Tampou&s;ama <HI>Emperor of</HI> Japan, <HI>who was bani&s;hed out of his Dominions, and died a Martyr for the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> At the &s;ame time there were five Kings and two Vice-Roys apprehended, who had pro|moted the Chri&s;tian Religion in their &s;e|veral Kingdoms; and they were thrown into Pri&s;on, and there remain'd until they died.</P>
<P>The &s;laughter was &s;o general, that not only the Je&s;uits and other Mi&s;&s;ionaries of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, but all the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> that had been converted by them, were put to Death when&s;oever they were &s;eiz'd: Some were hang'd, &s;ome thrown into the Rivers, or old Ditches, others were be|headed, and great numbers &s;uffered the mo&s;t cruel Deaths the <HI>Pagans</HI> could in|vent. But though the &s;laughter was very general, yet it cannot be imagin'd, that all the Chri&s;tians were apprehended at the &s;ame time, but many of them lay conceal'd,
<PB N="310" REF="349">
and skulk'd up and down in Corners for &s;everal Years before they were di&s;cover'd; and after the fir&s;t Heats of the Per&s;ecution were over, many of tho&s;e Je&s;uits and Monks who were &s;eiz'd, were for &s;ome time re&s;pited, and being ca&s;t into Pri&s;on, continued there until a new Emperor was Created, and then were put to cruel Deaths, with mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Torments.</P>
<P>After this time the name of a Chri&s;tian grew &s;o odious through all the Empire of <HI>Japan,</HI> that no Chri&s;tian was &s;uffered to live in it, but the <HI>Pagans</HI> &s;lew them all when&s;oever they di&s;covered them. And this wicked and bloody Con&s;piracy, which was &s;o contrary to the mild and charita|ble Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, was &s;uch a Scan|dal to the <HI>Pagans,</HI> and reproach to the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> that henceforward they were all e&s;teem'd Villains, Rebels, Impo&s;tors, and the wor&s;t of Men; and therefore when any of them were found out, all the People cry'd out, <HI>Away with them, Crucifie them:</HI> And Searchers were appointed to enquire diligently in all places, if any of them could be di&s;covered; as has been al|ready ob&s;erv'd in the <HI>Chapter of Laws.</HI></P>
<P>And this Relation of the Con&s;piracy of the Je&s;uits and other Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts, a|gain&s;t the <HI>Pagans,</HI> and the great Slaughter of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> which follow'd upon
<PB N="311" REF="350">
the Di&s;covery of it, is as firmly believ'd in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> by Tradition from Father to Son, as the Gunpowder-Plot is believ'd here in <HI>England,</HI> to have been contriv'd by the Je&s;uits and other Papi&s;ts: But I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that I cannot po&s;itively determine the time when it happen'd; only I think it mo&s;t probable, that it was about the Year 1616.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI. Of the coming of the <HI>Dutch</HI> into <HI>Ja|pan,</HI> with their Succe&s;s, and the Tricks they play'd.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> hearing of the great Slaughter of the Papi&s;ts in <HI>Japan,</HI> and that they were for ever bani&s;hed from that Empire, laid hold of this Opportuni|ty to &s;ettle a great Trade with the <HI>Japan|ne&s;e</HI>; and for that end having laded &s;eve|ral Ships with great Stores of &s;uch Com|modities as they thought mo&s;t vendible in that Country; they &s;ail'd to <HI>Japan,</HI> where being arriv'd, they were pre&s;ently
<PB N="312" REF="351">
call'd to an account, what they were? and from whence they came? They an|&s;wer'd, They were <HI>Hollanders</HI>; and when the <HI>Japan</HI> Inqui&s;itors urg'd them farther to declare, whether they were Chri&s;tians or no? They pretended at fir&s;t they did not under&s;tand what they meant by that Name, and therefore they could only tell them they profe&s;s'd the <HI>Holland</HI>'s Religion. But at la&s;t &s;ome of them told the <HI>Japanne&s;e,</HI> That they had heard of &s;ome call'd <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> who were Impo&s;tors, and wor&s;hip|ped a Crucified Man: By which Character the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> under&s;tood that the&s;e were the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> who had formerly been in <HI>Japan.</HI> And then the <HI>Dutch</HI> added far|ther, That there were none &s;uch in their Country, but in other parts of <HI>Europe</HI>; and that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were &s;o far from being of the &s;ame Religion with them, that they had always been hated and per|&s;ecuted by the&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> upon the account of Religion.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being related to the Em|peror, he commanded that they &s;hould have leave to land, and to bring them before him: When they were come into the Em|peror's pre&s;ence, they pre&s;ented him with two great Guns, and a &s;triking Clock with an Alarm, and a mu&s;ical Bell; both which wonderfully plea&s;ed the Emperor, but
<PB N="313" REF="352">
chiefly he admired the two Guns when he &s;aw them charg'd and di&s;charg'd be|fore him: Whereupon he gave them free leave to come and import their Commodi|ties into his Country, as thinking that their Commerce would be not only &s;afe, but very advantageous to <HI>Japan.</HI> But af|ter they had traded there for &s;ome Years, they begg'd leave of the Emperor to build a great Store-hou&s;e, in which they might lay up all their Merchandize; pretending it was a great lo&s;s to them to carry their Goods up and down the Country before they could &s;ell them; and that it would be more convenient, not only for them|&s;elves, but al&s;o for the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> to have a certain place appointed whither all Per|&s;ons might re&s;ort, either to buy their Com|modities, or take them in exchange for the Product of their Country. The Em|peror granted them leave to build &s;uch a Hou&s;e for containing their Goods: But they in&s;tead of a Ware-hou&s;e, built a ve|ry &s;trong Ca&s;tle, with very good Fortifi|cations; yet none of the Natives ever &s;u&s;|pected them of any ill de&s;ign, (but thought that the Hou&s;e was built after the <HI>Dutch</HI> way,) until &s;ome time after it was fini&s;h'd. But their de&s;ign was di&s;cover'd when a new Fleet of Ships arriv'd from <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>Japan</HI>; for the&s;e Ships were laden with
<PB N="314" REF="353">
Guns, Muskets, Pi&s;tols, and all &s;orts of Warlike In&s;truments, and great Stores of Gunpowder and Bullets; as plainly ap|pear'd by this Accident: The <HI>Dutch</HI> ha|ving conceal'd their Arms and Ammuni|tion in Wooden Frames, that they might not be &s;een by the <HI>Japanne&s;e,</HI> convey'd them out of their Ships, and laid them upon Carts to be carried to their Ca&s;tle: But it happen'd, unluckily for them, that &s;ome of the Carts were broken by the way, and the Wooden Frames bur&s;t in pieces by the fall, which di&s;cover'd their hidden Trea&s;ure of Arms and Ammuni|tion, and alarm'd the <HI>Japanne&s;e,</HI> who &s;aw them, with the apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome wick|ed De&s;ign, which was to be executed by &s;uch great quantities of Warlike Prepara|tions: Whereupon &s;ome of them run pre|&s;ently and acquainted the Emperor with what they had &s;een, and the danger that threatned his Country by the Tricks of the&s;e deceitful <HI>Hollanders</HI>; and he &s;ent away in all ha&s;te 10 or 12 Companies of Soldiers, who kill'd as many as they could find of them, but the greate&s;t part of them had e&s;cap'd from the Ca&s;tle, and were got into their Ships which had put to Sea, be|fore the Soldiers arriv'd: which happen'd by the over-&s;ight of the Natives, who might ea&s;ily have encompa&s;s'd the Ca&s;tle
<PB N="315" REF="354">
at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;o that none could enter in or go out of it, whereby all that were in it would have been forced either to &s;ur|render them&s;elves or die for Hunger. Af|ter this their Ca&s;tle and all the Guns they could find were &s;eized by the <HI>Japanne&s;e</HI> for the u&s;e of the Emperor; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> were for &s;ome time prohibited any Com|merce with <HI>Japan.</HI> But upon their hum|ble Petition and fair Promi&s;es, the Empe|ror gave them leave to come into <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> which was then under his Dominion, and thither they re&s;orted for &s;ome time: But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> not finding in <HI>Formo&s;a</HI> all the Commodities they wanted, did a|gain beg leave of the Emperor to trade in|to <HI>Japan</HI>; which the Emperor would not allow, until at la&s;t the King of <HI>Nanga&s;ak,</HI> interpos'd on their behalf, and pray'd that he might be permitted to receive them in|to his I&s;le, which is not far di&s;tant from the re&s;t of <HI>Japan.</HI> And this the Emperor granted upon the following Conditions, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That they &s;hould trample upon the Crucifix. 2<HI>dly,</HI> That the Inqui&s;itors &s;hould take out of their Ships all their Guns and Ammunition, all their Sails, Ma&s;ts, Ropes, and other Furniture, to be kept in a Store-hou&s;e as long as the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;tay'd in the Country. 3<HI>dly,</HI> That he &s;hould appoint Soldiers to go along with them through the
<PB N="316" REF="355">

<P>The&s;e Conditions have been hitherto very exactly ob&s;erv'd; whenever therefore they have &s;old off, or barter'd all their Com|modities, and are ready to put to Sea a|gain, then all their Warlike In&s;truments and Ship-Tackle, that were taken away at their fir&s;t coming, are re&s;tor'd to them again, and they have free liberty to return into their own Country.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Dutch</HI> had got footing in <HI>Japan,</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were prohibited to come there under pain of Death, the <HI>Dutch</HI> advi&s;ed the Emperor to di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> from all other <HI>Foreigners</HI> by this Te&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> by making an Image of Chri&s;t Crucified, which the&s;e <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> adore, and keeping it in all their Sea-Port Towns, and requiring all <HI>Foreigners</HI> to trample up|on this Image: For, &s;aid they, If the&s;e <HI>Foreigners</HI> be <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> they will not trample upon it; and all others who do trample upon it, are certainly no <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>This Te&s;t was afterwards try'd upon &s;ome <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> or other <HI>Monks</HI> of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVII. Of the new Devices of the Je&s;uits for getting into <HI>Japan.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THus the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> by denying Chri|&s;tianity, &s;ecur'd their freedom of Trade in <HI>Japan,</HI> but the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> were for ever &s;hut out of that Country by this Te&s;t of Chri&s;tianity, until the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> by their &s;ubtilty invented a new way for procuring their admi&s;&s;ion into it, which was this: They learn in the fir&s;t place the <HI>Japan</HI> Lan|guage in the City of <HI>Goa,</HI> where it is taught in the Academy; and when they can &s;peak it very well, they put on the <HI>Ja|pan</HI> Habit, and thus accoutred, they go to &s;ome Port in <HI>Japan,</HI> and being examined by the Searchers what Country they be|long to, and from whence they come? They readily an&s;wer, That they are <HI>Ja|panne&s;e,</HI> and come from &s;uch an I&s;land, and &s;uch a City in <HI>Japan,</HI> naming them, which is ea&s;ily believ'd by the Searchers, becau&s;e of their Language and Habit.</P>
<P>And having thus &s;ecurely pa&s;s'd the Te&s;t, when they come a&s;hore they di&s;gui&s;e them&s;elves under various &s;hapes; for &s;ome &s;et up for Merchants and Toy-&s;ellers,
<PB N="319" REF="358">
others for Tutors or Mechanicks, and they live in a private Hou&s;e, and follow their &s;everal Employments, with as much care and indu&s;try, as if they depended upon them for a livelihood, though 'tis certain they are otherwi&s;e provided with &s;ufficient means to maintain them, by tho&s;e who &s;end them thither. For the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ends every Year a certain number into <HI>Japan,</HI> and takes care to furni&s;h them with all things nece&s;&s;ary, and they are allow'd two Years for learning the <HI>Japan</HI> Lan|guage, four Years for their &s;tay in <HI>Ja|pan,</HI> and about three Years for their Jour|ney backward and forward. They have a certain <HI>Japan</HI> Word, which they pro|nounce after a manner peculiar to them|&s;elves, whereby they know one another; the Word is <HI>Abo,</HI> which in <HI>Japan</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>quickly,</HI> by which the new-comers, as they walk through the Cities and Villages, know their Brethren that have been there before them; and after they know one another, they meet together in private places to di&s;cour&s;e about their own Affairs.</P>
<P>Thus there is a continual Succe&s;&s;ion of a new Mi&s;&s;ionary after four Years are ex|pir'd, to &s;upply the place of him who then returns home, as I am very well a&s;&s;ur'd by my own experience, though 'tis not ea&s;y to gue&s;s for what end they are &s;ent, or
<PB N="320" REF="359">
what good they do when they come there. For it is in vain for them to pretend that they convert many of the Natives, du|ring their four Years &s;tay, to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, as I know that &s;ome of them boa&s;t after their return, &s;ince it is impo&s;|&s;ible they &s;hould e&s;cape the diligence of &s;o many Searchers, as are every-where appointed to detect them, if they &s;hould publickly own them&s;elves to be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and endeavour to convert the <HI>Pagans:</HI> And indeed, if it were true what they relate, that one had converted twenty, another thir|ty, and a third fifty, during their &s;tay in <HI>Japan,</HI> ever &s;ince the time of their Bani&s;hment, there would be very few <HI>Pa|gans</HI> left in that Country, according to their account of Conver&s;ions. 'Tis true, that &s;ome Years ago there were <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> or <HI>Po|pi&s;h Prie&s;ts,</HI> who made &s;ome Converts to Chri&s;tianity; but in a little time they were di&s;cover'd by the Searchers, and both they and their Converts were burnt alive, ex|cept a few who renounced Chri&s;tianity and embraced their ancient Idolatry, for fear of the Torments of &s;uch a cruel Death: But at <HI>Rome</HI> they talk nothing of any &s;uch di&s;a&s;ters, but every one boa&s;ts of the nu|merous Converts he has made in the Em|pire of <HI>Japan,</HI> and plea&s;es him&s;elf with the Relation of his Travels, and the many
<PB N="321" REF="360">
wonderful things he has &s;een, being greatly puffed up with an Opinion of the great Glory and Fame he has merited by &s;uch a difficult and noble Undertaking. Upon the whole matter it &s;eems to me mo&s;t pro|bable, that the great De&s;ign of the Mi&s;|&s;ionaries, who are &s;ent to <HI>Japan,</HI> &s;ince the time of their Bani&s;hment from it, is to &s;py out the Country, and to inform them|&s;elves exactly of the Situation of their Har|bours, the Number of their Forts and Ca|&s;tles, and all the Strength of the Empire, and to take Aim by what Methods they may be attack'd with be&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, hoping that at length &s;ome magnanimous Chri|&s;tian Prince will undertake a glorious Ex|pedition, with &s;ufficient Forces to conquer that Empire by their direction, and to plant the Chri&s;tian Religion among the Natives, in &s;pite of all the Prejudices wherewith they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd at pre&s;ent again&s;t it: For indeed I cannot perceive what other Benefit and Advantage they can propo&s;e to them&s;elves by all the Trou|ble and Expences they are at, in &s;ending &s;o many Mi&s;&s;ionaries into <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P>Within a few Years after the Per&s;ecu|tion of the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Japan,</HI> the Empe|ror having obtain'd the I&s;le <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> as has been above related, began to per&s;ecute al&s;o
<PB N="322" REF="361">
the Chri&s;tians that were in that Country; but tho' he treated the Je&s;uits and Popi&s;h Prie&s;ts there with the &s;ame &s;everity he had us'd in <HI>Japan,</HI> burning &s;ome alive, cruci|fying others, or hanging them up by the Legs till they were dead; yet to the Na|tives who were Chri&s;tians he &s;hew'd more Mercy, leaving it to their own free Choice, either to renounce Chri&s;tianity, or to de|part for ever out of their own Country; whereupon many of them cho&s;e rather to fly into other Countries than deny Chri&s;t; but others being unwilling to leave their E&s;tates and their Country, renounc'd Chri|&s;tianity, and embrac'd their former Super|&s;tition. And after that time the &s;ame Law was in force again&s;t the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> as was made again&s;t them in <HI>Japan.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The CONCL&V;SION.</HEAD>
<P>FRom what has been &s;aid of the Cau&s;es of the great Per&s;ecution of the Chri|&s;tians in <HI>Japan,</HI> we may clearly under&s;tand how great a prejudice the Je&s;uits have done to Chri&s;tianity, and what a Re|proach
<PB N="323" REF="362">
and Di&s;grace they have brought upon the Chri&s;tian Name, by impo&s;ing their Popi&s;h Errors upon the People as ne|ce&s;&s;ary Articles of Faith, and by contri|ving that barbarous and bloody Ma&s;&s;acre which they intended again&s;t all the poor Pagans: Whereas if they had propos'd the Chri&s;tian Religion in its purity and &s;implicity, and behav'd them&s;elves towards their Pro&s;elytes with that Meekne&s;s, Cha|rity, and Sincerity, which became their Apo&s;tolical Office, I dare be confident to affirm, that in all probability the whole Empire of <HI>Japan</HI> had now been Chri&s;tian: But now by their Mi&s;repre&s;entations, and wicked Practices, the <HI>Japone&s;e</HI> have &s;uch a fal&s;e Notion of Chri&s;tianity, and &s;uch &s;trong Prejudices again&s;t it, that it would be much more difficult now to convert them; nay, the Door is &s;hut again&s;t any Chri&s;tians who might have &s;uch a charita|ble De&s;ign, or would attempt to remove their Prejudices, and po&s;&s;e&s;s their Minds with a ju&s;t Idea of Chri&s;tianity. How de|te&s;table then was the Wickedne&s;s of the Je&s;uits, which occa&s;ion'd all this Mi&s;chief! And how deplorable is the Ca&s;e of the&s;e poor Pagans, who are now &s;o fetter'd in Chains of Darkne&s;s, and bound up to their Idolatrous Practices, that they can never hope to &s;ee the glorious Light of the Go|&s;pel,
<PB N="324" REF="363">
or feel the Power of it in their Hearts and Lives, as might have been rea&s;onably expected from them: For if they do &s;o exactly ob&s;erve the Precepts of their own Religion, altho' it be uncertain and con|trary to the Divine Nature, altho' it en|joyn them &s;uch a horrible and cruel Pra|ctice as to &s;acrifice their own Sons; with what Cheerfulne&s;s, Humility, and Venera|tion, would they have perform'd the rea|&s;onable Service and Obedience of Chri|&s;tianity, had they been enlightned with that heavenly Doctrine in its purity, and ta&s;ted the Power of it, in purging their Hearts, and reforming their Lives.</P>
<P>Some perhaps may think that I have done too much Honour to the Pagan Re|ligion as it is profe&s;s'd in <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> by gi|ving &s;uch a long and particular Explica|tion of it, as if I were &s;till per&s;uaded of the truth of it; which God forbid: And therefore I mu&s;t de&s;ire &s;uch Per&s;ons to con|&s;ider, that I was oblig'd to give an Account of all things relating to that Religion, as they are to be found in <HI>Jarhabadiond,</HI> which is our Scripture, tho' I am very far from believing them to be true; nay, I am fully per&s;uaded that they are fal&s;e, by the following Rea&s;ons which I &s;hall briefly mention: 'Tis a certain and infallible Ar|gument of the Fal&s;hood of any Religion,
<PB N="325" REF="364">
that it commandeth &s;uch things as are contrary to the Divine Nature, and to tho&s;e Notions which every one hath of God's infinite Goodne&s;s: Such is the Com|mand in our <HI>Jarhabadiond,</HI> which requires us to &s;acrifice &s;o many thou&s;and innocent Babes every Year; which is a thing &s;o cruel, and &s;o contrary to the Tenderne&s;s of Hu|man Nature, that we cannot believe it to be the Command of a good and gracious God, but of &s;ome evil Spirit who delights in Human Blood, and in the Mi&s;ery and De&s;truction of Mankind. And when once I was convinc'd of the Fal&s;hood of our Religion, by requiring &s;uch a cruel and bloody Sacrifice, I pre&s;ently concluded, that all the Miracles pretended to be wrought in confirmation of it, were meer trick and forgery; becau&s;e I am certain that God would not exert his Omnipotent Power to confirm a Lye, and maintain an Impo&s;ture. Be&s;ides that, any one may quick|ly be &s;atisfied how little Rea&s;on there is to believe, that the pretended Miracles were really wrought, &s;ince they are only men|tion'd in our <HI>Jarhabadiond,</HI> which the Prie&s;ts keep in their own hands, and will not &s;uf|fer any of the common People to have a Copy of it; which gives a &s;hrewd &s;u&s;pi|cion, that there is &s;ome Trick and Impo|&s;ture, &s;ince they do &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid any
<PB N="326" REF="365">
means of di&s;covering the Truth; which &s;u&s;picion is very much increas'd by the Ty|ranny which the Prie&s;ts exerci&s;e over the common People, in exacting an implicit Faith to their Dictates, without giving them any rational Grounds for believing, and obliging them under pain of Death never to accu&s;e the Prie&s;ts of any Fal&s;hood, tho' they be very certain that he is guilty of it. The Prie&s;ts indeed pretend, that their God does &s;ometimes appear to the People in the form of a Lion, when he is angry with them; and at other times, in the form of a Camel, when he is pacified: But every one may plainly perceive, that this pretended Miracle is nothing but a Trick of the Prie&s;ts, who have the oppor|tunity of &s;hewing &s;uch or &s;uch a Bea&s;t to the People, without being di&s;cover'd, &s;ince the whole management of the matter is left to them&s;elves, having the Bea&s;ts ready to &s;et up at their plea&s;ure with all &s;ecrecy. If any one &s;hould ask me, How can the Prie&s;ts put &s;uch Tricks upon the common People, and carry on &s;uch Impo&s;tures? I an&s;wer, There are many In&s;tances of the &s;ame na|ture in other Nations, who having no Re|velation, believe and do &s;uch things as are more ab&s;urd than what is here pretended: Such were the <HI>Egyptians</HI> who were famous for all parts of Learning, and yet were
<PB N="327" REF="366">
per&s;uaded to wor&s;hip Crocodiles and Oni|ons. Nay, even in the <HI>Roman</HI> Church we &s;ee, that many Ab&s;urdities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mpos'd up|on the common People to be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">v'd con|trary to Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on: And why then may not &s;uch a rude and ignorant People as the <HI>Formo&s;ans,</HI> be impos'd upon by the Tricks of cunning Men? But how this Im|po&s;ture is manag'd, 'tis not my bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent to enquire, 'tis &s;ufficient for me, that I am fully per&s;uaded by undeniable Arguments of the Fal&s;hood of the Religion of <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI> Now to this Omnipotent and Merciful GOD who hath by the Grace of his Holy Spirit call'd me from Error and Super&s;tition, to the true Knowledge of his Will, and of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, my Re|deemer and Mediator, be a&s;crib'd eternal Prai&s;e, Honour, Magnificence, and Glory, by all the Creatures for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, CONCERNING The AUTHOR's Journey from <HI>Avignon</HI> to <HI>Rome.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 1700, being the Year of <HI>Jubilee,</HI> I was invited by the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> to accompany &s;eventeen young Gentlemen to <HI>Rome</HI>; who undertook that Journey rather out of Curio&s;ity than Devotion, to &s;ee the Pomp and Magnificence of the Ceremonies that are then ob&s;erv'd in that City: And the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> per&s;uaded me to go, hoping that by the &s;ight of the&s;e Ceremonies I &s;hould be induc'd to embrace their Reli|gion. I was ea&s;ily prevail'd upon to com|ply with their De&s;ires, and &s;o we travell'd together to <HI>Rome,</HI> the other Gentlemen in Pilgrims Habit, and I in <HI>Japan</HI> Cloaths, and arriv'd there a little before the Death of the Pope, who being then &s;ick, would not admit of any to come and &s;ee him; but we &s;aw all the valuable Curio&s;ities that are kept in that famous City. And the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> at <HI>Avignon</HI> having given me Let|ters
<PB N="129" REF="368">
of Recommendation, I was nobly entertain'd thereby the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> of that City, who were very civil and obliging: But when they exhorted me to embrace the Chri&s;tian Faith, I excus'd my &s;elf for not complying with their de&s;ire, and told them, That I intended to return again to <HI>Avignon,</HI> and to be baptiz'd there by the &s;ame Father who had brought me out of my own Country. After we had &s;tay'd a|bove a Month in <HI>Rome,</HI> we return'd a|gain to <HI>Avignon,</HI> where I was civilly re|ceiv'd by the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI>; who, as I have rea&s;on to believe, had charg'd the young Gentlemen my Fellow-Travellers to take care of me, that I &s;hould not make an e&s;cape; for they watch'd me as narrowly during the whole Journey, as Serjeants u&s;e to do a Pri&s;oner. Pre&s;ently after my Re|turn, the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> ask'd me, how I lik'd all the&s;e Ceremonies I had &s;een at <HI>Rome?</HI> To whom I an&s;wer'd, That I was very well pleas'd with them, and did greatly admire them: But then withal I added, Since you condemn our Pagan Religion, becau&s;e our Religious Wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts only in Externals, how can you alledge your external Ceremonies in Confirmation of your Religion: To which they an|&s;wered well enough, That they did not
<PB N="130" REF="369">
condemn our Ceremonies merely as exter|nal, but becau&s;e they were de&s;titute of any internal Virtue: Whereas the Chri|&s;tian Religion con&s;i&s;ts much more in its internal Power, than any external Shew: And therefore, &s;aid they, all our Cere|monies are unprofitable, unle&s;s the Heart be joyn'd with them; and we only make u&s;e of them to excite Men to Devotion, and to in&s;pire them with greater Reve|rence and Fervor in the Wor&s;hip of God. With this An&s;wer I &s;eem'd to be &s;o far &s;a|tisfy'd, that I made no Reply; tho' I might have told them, that we us'd the external Ceremonies of our Pagan Reli|gion for the &s;ame ends and purpo&s;es as they do theirs. This indeed was a great &s;candal to me, to &s;ee the corrupt Lives of all &s;orts of People, both great and &s;mall, at <HI>Rome,</HI> where they appear'd &s;o publickly to be guilty of Adultery and Sodomy, that all Travellers might perceive them; which made me &s;ay to my &s;elf, Certainly if the&s;e Men did heartily believe their Religion, they would better ob&s;erve its Preceps, and live according to it; but by their wicked Practices it appears, that they impo&s;e &s;uch things upon the common People, which they them&s;elves do not believe to be true: Be&s;ides, I had heard &s;o many Stories of
<PB N="131" REF="370">
the Miracles wrought by the Relicks of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and other Saints, and chiefly of tho&s;e which are pretended to be done in the Chapel of <HI>Loretto,</HI> which I believe to be fal&s;e, that from thence I concluded their Relations of the Miracles wrought by Chri&s;t, to be no le&s;s fal&s;e: So that my Journey to <HI>Rome</HI> was &s;o far from inducing me to embrace the Chri&s;tian Religion, that it rather prejudic'd me &s;trongly again&s;t it.</P>
