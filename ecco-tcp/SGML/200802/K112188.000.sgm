<P>Upon my Soul Man you &s;ay too much to an unworthy Brother&mdash;I am a Stranger to <HI>England,</HI> but extraordinarily pleas'd with your good Acquaintance, which recompences the Toil of my fatiguing Journey from the City of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>

<P>You &s;peak like a Man of Judgment, Bro|ther, and I doubt not to convince the ignorant World, that <HI>Virgil,</HI> amid&s;t his &s;oaring Flights and pompous Elegance, was an A&s;s to <HI>S&mdash;l.</HI></P>

<P>But we &s;hall find it a plaguy Task to per|&s;uade the giddy Multitude to this Opinion: You may &s;eem to re&s;emble the Style and Manner of the Ancients, but I fear the Colours are faint, and will not bear Examination&mdash;They are <HI>&s;trong and &s;ublime,</HI> we <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>&s;piritle&s;s.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goo&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you Gentlemen had more of the <HI>Hibernian</HI> Quality than to entertain a mean Opinion of your &s;elves, and your own Capacities: Lay a&s;ide Humility, if you intend to thrive in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Territories, and let Conceit, Hy|pocri&s;y and Pride take place; be bold and auda|cious in &s;elf-prai&s;es; learn to Cabal, flatter, and Condemn, and the Game's your own.</P>

<P>But hold! 'tis not too late to learn&mdash;I believe I can de&s;pi&s;e Merit, and for a con&s;ide|rable Sum be a con&s;iderable Flatterer; but the greate&s;t Work is to compliment my &s;elf.</P>

<P>Pugh, that's the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in the World; you've Nature on your &s;ide, which in|cites Fondne&s;s in all to Works of their own Pro|duction; I can do it with an Air of Gravity, and damn with a Grace the Misbelievers of an Un|truth.</P>

<P>Every airy Female tells ye her Ware is the be&s;t, mo&s;t charming, the mo&s;t inviting, and all that&mdash;And cannot we extoll our own Ver&s;es, many whereof de&s;cribe tho&s;e Beauties they fal&s;ly pretend to be Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>Goo&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no &s;uch thing as real Worth, my Friend, 'tis all imaginary: The whole Univer&s;e is a &s;ham, and fal&s;e Repre&s;entation&mdash;Generals are not always made with Fighting, Scholars by Learning, nor Divines by Study: No, Manage|ment and Caballing will &s;ave infinite Trouble of that kind&mdash;'Tis but to place proper Fame-brokers at the mo&s;t remarkable Parts of the Town, Fellows of good Lungs to bellow out your Prai&s;e, the Work is done; the ignorant Populace, fam'd for Credulity, will believe it with as much Eager|ne&s;s as they entertain Scandal again&s;t true Merit; and thus is a Reputation at once acquired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this &s;eems, according to my Notion of Things, to be incon&s;i&s;tent with true Sen&s;e, and 'tis contrary to all Scotti&s;h Politicks; we are equally backward in Prai&s;ing as in Condemning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Goo&s;e.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sen&s;e, Sir, is nothing el&s;e but a Rule of acting on the Principle of Intere&s;t; &s;o that if it promotes my Profit, I'll applaud my &s;elf, or any &s;en&s;ele&s;s Wretch; and if my Fortune cannot be rai&s;ed without calumniating what is truly Great and Glorious, the doing it is an Argument of &s;ound Sen&s;e, and perfectly con&s;onant with the Di|ctates of Nature, and the great <HI>SENECA</HI>'s Philo&s;ophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saun.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot be of your Opinion, Brother, I mu&s;t term that <HI>Abu&s;e,</HI> which you are pleas'd to call Sen&s;e, in Spite of the greate&s;t Oratory to recommend it.</P>

your be&s;t Scenes of Love are notoriou&s;ly wor&s;e than tho&s;e of the lowe&s;t Poet in this or any other Age.&mdash;The few Similies are no way adapted, and really appear like Flowers in a Dung|hill.&mdash;In your other Poetical Writings all the Beauties are borrow'd: If we dive&s;t you of your Thefts, you'll re&s;emble the Crow in the Fable, and little will remain but Froth and Rhime.</P>

<P>You may compliment your Genius as you plea&s;e, and your Friends may give it out, but I &s;hall take Liberty to affirm that 'tis far from being a perfect one in Poetry: A perfect Genius is capable of producing a fini&s;h'd Piece of the greate&s;t Length, which is what you will never be Ma&s;ter of.&mdash;A few good Lines I confe&s;s you &s;ometimes happen to write, but more from a <HI>Fla&s;hy Wit,</HI> than a true <HI>Native Genius.</HI></P>
