<P>Ruin'd! how?&mdash;But no matter. I thank fortune that has put in my power&mdash;But here &s;he comes!&mdash;My dear Cleora, love and happine&s;s await thee! The chai&s;e is at the bottom of the avenue, and nothing can retard our felicity!</P>

<P>I cannot con&s;ent, Glanville! I have made a &s;olemn promi&s;e to my mother&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cleo.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Glan.</SPEAKER>
<P>That E&s;tella has bred you up, and taken care of your fortune, out of re&s;pect to your real parents; but has carefully conceal'd from you the amount of one, and the quality of the other.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="26" REF="26">

<P>'Tis truth: I can give you indubitable proof of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cleo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am ruined!&mdash;For the implicit con&s;ent I have given her, at fir&s;t verbally, and at length under my hand has certainly put me entirely in her power!</P>

<P>Accept his offer, Cleora; he has told you the truth. I am not your mother, though I hope to be &s;o to-morrow morning.</P>

<P>Yes, my child! Come to my arms! Upon the death of your mother, who&s;e lo&s;s I could not bear, I left you in E&s;tella's care, and travell'd to improve my fortune. The extravagant frolic I put in practice has an&s;wered my purpo&s;e beyond ex|pectation; for I find my old friend Glanville's nephew as ho|ne&s;t a fellow as his uncle; therefore, to reward the fidelity of E&s;tella, and his affection, we'll go all to church to-morrow morning. I make but few words about any thing!</P>
