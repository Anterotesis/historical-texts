<P>A DAY IN TURKEY; OR, THE RUSSIAN SLAVES.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>HINTS have been thrown out, and the idea in|du&s;triou&s;ly circulated, that the following comedy is tainted with POLITICS. I prote&s;t I know nothing about politics;&mdash;will Mi&s;s Wol&s;tonecraft forgive me&mdash;who&s;e book contains &s;uch a body of mind as I hardly ever met with&mdash;if I &s;ay that politics are <HI>unfe|minine?</HI> I never in my life could attend to their di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>TRUE COMEDY has always been defined to be a picture of life&mdash;a record of pa&s;&s;ing manners&mdash;a mirror to reflect to &s;ucceeding times the characters and follies of the pre&s;ent. How then could I, pretending to be a comic poet, bring an emigrant Frenchman before
<PB REF="3">
the public at this day, and not make him hint at the events which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, or were then pa&s;&s;ing in his native country? A character &s;o written would have been anomalous&mdash;the critics ought to have had no mercy on me. It is A LA GREQUE who &s;peaks, not <HI>I</HI>; nor can I be accountable for <HI>his</HI> &s;entiments. <HI>Such</HI> is my idea of tracing CHARACTER; and were I to continue to write for the &s;tage, I &s;hould always govern my&s;elf by it.</P>
<P>THE illiberal and <HI>fal&s;e</HI> &s;ugge&s;tions concerning the politics of the comedy I could frankly forgive, had they not deprived it of the honour of a COMMAND. The pa&s;&s;ages on which tho&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations were built, were on the &s;econd night omitted, but imme|diately afterwards re&s;tored; and the DAY IN TURKEY leaves the pre&s;s exactly as it has continued to be performed amid&s;t the mo&s;t vivid and uninter|rupted plaudits&mdash;or interrupted only by the glitter of &s;oft tears; a &s;pecies of applau&s;e not le&s;s flattering than the &s;pontaneous laugh, or the voluntary colli&s;ion of hands.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">SOME of the performers in this comedy have play'd &s;o tran&s;cendently well, that their names de&s;erve to be recorded; but to particulari&s;e any, when <HI>all</HI> have aim'd at perfection, would be invidious.</P>

<P>A pretty girl faith, and daughter to one of our great Ru&s;&s;ian boyards&mdash;a boyard ranks as a mar|quis did in France, and as a laird &s;till does in Scotland &mdash;I love to elucidate.</P>

<P>That's the very thing he would get at. &mdash;Ma'am and he were walking like two doves in the boyard's garden, which garden was border'd by trees, which trees were border'd by the &s;ea&mdash;Out &s;prings from the wood forty Turks with forty &s;abres, and forty pair of great mon&s;trous whi&s;kers, which &s;o frighten'd the bride, that, in&s;tead of running away, &s;he fainted away, and &s;taid there.</P>

<P>Hah, hah! then my countrymen had a prize.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they had, worth two Jew's eyes. Six of them hurried off with her to a Felucca, which lay at the edge of the wood; and all the re&s;t employ'd my ma&s;ter. I &s;uppo&s;e they would have had him too, but the boyard, with a large party of friends, appearing at the top of a walk, they thought fit to make off with what they had.&mdash;Well, my ma&s;ter's bridal bed was, that night, the beach, where he &s;taid raving and beat|ing him&s;elf, as tho' he took him&s;elf for one of the Turk|i&s;h ravi&s;hers.</P>

<SPEAKER>AZIM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! thy &s;tory is well&mdash;&s;o, all that night, he walk'd in the garden&mdash;Oh, and the night|ingales, I warrant, &s;ung re&s;pon&s;es to his complaints, and the melancholy wood dove cooed in &s;ympathetic &s;orrow.&mdash;It mu&s;t have been very plea&s;ant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A LA GR.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, a plea&s;ant night as could be; but it co&s;t him a fortnight's lying in bed; for a hi&s;&s;ing hot fever laid hold of him; and the doctors, with all their rank and file of phials and bolu&s;&s;es, could hardly drive him out of his veins.</P>
