<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE importance of Hi&s;tory, as an object of &s;tu|dious attention, has been &s;o frequently illu&s;trated, and &s;o generally admitted, that to attempt fre&s;h arguments in &s;upport of its exten&s;ive utility, would be as &s;uperfluous, as it would be &s;ceptical and ri|diculous to bring it into que&s;tion. But Hi&s;tory, when employed in elucidating <HI>Public Concerns,</HI> and re|cording NATIONAL TRANSACTIONS, however import|ant to the State&s;man, or amu&s;ive to the Politician, does not come &s;o immediately home to the concerns and feelings of mankind, as the particular branch of this literary &s;cience which develops the &s;ources of in|dividual action, and traces the foot&s;teps of eminent Characters, from the vale of ob&s;curity to the &s;ublimi|ties of Fame, or the &s;plendid abodes of opulence and power. The fate of brave or injured nations, may, it is true, call forth our &s;ympathetic feelings, and the exploits of heroic armies may warm the gratified &s;oul with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of admiration; but he who devotes his labours to the narrative of facts like the&s;e, though he may claim a more un|fading laurel as his reward, confers not an equal obligation on &s;ociety, with him who, dedicating his attention to the minuter, but more philo&s;ophi|cal branch of hi&s;tory, perpetuates the Conduct and
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
Characters of Individuals, and pre&s;erves, in durable colours, the mental features of tho&s;e with whom we might de&s;ire to a&s;&s;imulate, or who&s;e example it &s;hould be our wi&s;h to &s;hun. The former province of the Hi&s;torian, it is true, fills the mind with more grand ideas, and better &s;erves to produce the &s;pe|culative plea&s;ures, or awakens &s;urpri&s;e and admira|tion; it is from the latter we are to &s;eek for the in&s;truction, which, in every department of life, may be found of practical importance.</P>
<P>Biography does not only rou&s;e to emulation, by &s;hewing the rewards of genius and application, point|ing out the proper objects of patronage and renown, and holding up to our view the mo&s;t &s;plendid and at|tractive examples: it furni&s;hes al&s;o the means of &s;uc|ce&s;s, by putting us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the experience of former candidates; and thus &s;moothing before us the thorny and intricate paths which conduct to the favoured goal. To &s;peak by a more familiar figure, Biography unfolds the motives and &s;ources of human conduct; it di&s;plays the minute &s;prings which fir&s;t &s;et the grand machine in action; and traces, from wheel to wheel, the intricate movements by which the whole &s;y&s;tem is put in motion, and the important effects are produced: while general Hi&s;tory affords only the repre&s;entation of Facts; leaving the mind to wander in the regions of uncertainty, vaguely con|jecturing by what means &s;imilar attainments are again to be expected. In &s;hort, Biography may be
<PB N="v" REF="6">
called the Key of the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> by means of which we are initiated among the &s;ecret my&s;te|ries of tho&s;e apparent miracels which, in the grand &s;phere of human action, have contributed to &s;urpri&s;e and ennoble mankind; while the Hi&s;tory of Na|tions and Events, leaves us awe-&s;truck without the Temple, gazing with wonder at the dazzling phoeno|mena.</P>
<P>The foregoing remarks are applicable to Biogra|phy in general; and would, in &s;ome re&s;pects, not only &s;uit the pre&s;ent publication, but be equally per|tinent as an introduction to the labours of the philo|&s;ophic Plutarch, and the light &s;ketches of the play|ful but penetrating Che&s;terfield. But the Biogra|phia Addenda, with which we have enriched our work, makes it nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould particularly no|tice the &s;uperior advantages of <HI>modern</HI> Biography.</P>
<P>Man is at all times, and in all countries, the &s;ame; that is to &s;ay, as to the admixture of vices and vir|tues, powers and weakne&s;s; and, therefore, the HIS|TORY OF MAN, in every Age, in every Country, is a &s;erious and in&s;tructive object for MAN'S ATTEN|TION. But tho&s;e qualities and endowments, tho&s;e blemi&s;hes and perfections, are differently called into action at different periods, and in different places, by means of the prevalence of climate and of habit, of cu&s;toms, of accidents, and examples, &s;o as to produce various and widely di&s;&s;imilar modulations. Nay, with &s;o much latitude is the general maxim of
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
the uniformity of human nature, as a Ma&s;s, to be under&s;tood, that blind indeed, to rationality and ex|perience, mu&s;t be the pretended philo&s;opher, who &s;hould not admit, that the different influences of ex|ternal cau&s;es, at different times, and in different coun|tries, produce, not only an infinite diver&s;ity of exte|rior deportment and appearances, but al&s;o the mo&s;t material actual differences and changes in human character: &s;o far as relates to the &s;tate and intere&s;ts of Society, and to whatever endowments are nece&s;|&s;ary for the advancement and happine&s;s of indivi|duals.</P>
<P><HI>Ages,</HI> as well as <HI>Nations,</HI> have their <HI>different com|plexions</HI>; nor are the &s;hades of <HI>mind,</HI> le&s;s curiou&s;ly and progre&s;&s;ively diver&s;ified, than tho&s;e of cutaneous tint and phy&s;iognomical expre&s;&s;ion The &s;ame prin|ciple of human nature, therefore, which leads us ra|ther to be delighted with the portraiture of a contem|porary friend, than with the effigy of long mouldered ance&s;tors, or the heroes of di&s;tant climes, will occa|&s;ion us to peru&s;e with more <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> the lives of tho&s;e who have become famous in our own days, and who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves within the &s;phere we our&s;elves are to move, than the recorded exploits of &s;uch as have, neither by age nor country, any hold upon our prejudices, or claim to our affections. Nor is this the only foundation of preference upon which this &s;pecies of Biography re&s;ts. Plea&s;ure, it is true, is a u&s;eful auxiliary to literature and &s;tudy, whether
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
con&s;idered as an object of allurement, or a con&s;e|quent gratification. But u&s;ele&s;s above every rank and order of &s;ociety, are the <HI>tribe</HI> of <HI>writers,</HI> if to amu&s;e is the only object at which they aim. A prin|ciple like this would degrade the &s;ons of Science to a level with the gra&s;shopper that chirrips in the fields, or the fly that flutters his painted wings among the blo&s;&s;oms of the &s;pring.</P>
<P>If it be <HI>in&s;tructive</HI> to con over the le&s;&s;ons of POLICY <HI>and</HI> VALOUR which our plain rough ance&s;tors taught, when POLICY and VALOUR were in their infant &s;tate, and to note the rude manner in which the&s;e princi|ples were by them exerted, how <HI>indi&s;pen&s;ible</HI> is it that we call in the aid of Biography to conduct us to the Camps and the Cabinets of tho&s;e who have entered upon the &s;cene of exertion but &s;hortly before us, and who, con&s;equently, are our more proper guides and our more able in&s;tructors.</P>
<P>Ancient and foreign Biography, may, it is true, &s;hew us the general principles and grand traits of hu|man nature, and tend to the formation of &s;teady cha|racter; but they are the <HI>minutiae</HI> which &s;ecure a man's pro&s;perity in life, and tend to &s;tamp his reputation with the world; and he who &s;hould attempt the ac|quirement of the&s;e from any but his contemporaries and compatriots, would make no better figure in the &s;ea&s;on of bu&s;tle and action, than he who, with untu|tored and antiquated courage, &s;hould, twanging the Indian Bow in the face of an European phalanx, defend him&s;elf with a brea&s;t-plate and target, again&s;t
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
the thunder of modern Artillery. Hence then it is evident, not only that "the proper <HI>&s;tudy</HI> of <HI>mankind</HI> is man," but that the mo&s;t important le&s;&s;on in the cour&s;e of this &s;tudy, is that which teaches us to con&s;ider <HI>man</HI> under all the impre&s;&s;ions which the <HI>climate</HI> and <HI>age</HI> we live in, have &s;tamped upon his <HI>character</HI></P>
<P>This branch of &s;tudy is equally e&s;&s;ential, whether we con&s;ider it as the mean of diving into the hearts and characters of others, or of a&s;&s;i&s;ting and directing our|&s;elves in the departments of life to which by chance or inclination we are attached. In the former ca&s;e it enables us to detect the fallacy of habitual delu&s;ion, in the latter it points out the track which we ought, in prudence, to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>As to the particular object to which the &s;tudy of Biography &s;hould be directed, inclination and caprice may be the directors of many, while, with others, profe&s;&s;ion, or other circum&s;tances of intere&s;t or at|tachment, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily determine; And though this fir&s;t volume pre&s;ents but few examples of this mo|dern ca&s;t, it is intended, in the pro&s;ecution of the work, to give &s;o ample a collection, as to furni&s;h abun|dance of argument, both for the amu&s;ement and in|&s;truction of the Reader, by whatever ta&s;te or profe&s;|&s;ion he may be directed in his &s;tudies.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG all the literary pur&s;uits of life, none claim a greater attention than the in&s;tructive &s;tudy of BIOGRAPHY.&mdash;It has advantages &s;uperior to general hi&s;tory; it repre&s;ents great men detached from the crowd of other actors, and by de&s;cending into a detail of their actions and characters, it throws more light on human nature, excites more to imitation, and exhibits the human mind in all forms and &s;itua|tions. The &s;triking facts of hi&s;tory, the ri&s;e of &s;tates, or the fall of kingdoms, affect the reader but for a moment; the monarch or the &s;tate&s;man alone find opportunities to reduce the knowledge gained from them to practice. But when BIOGRAPHY &s;hews the effects of vice or folly in an individual; or when by the exertion of any virtue, we behold a &s;hining character ri&s;ing to honour, or enabled to drive mi&s;|fortunes far from him&mdash;then each per&s;on naturally makes the application to him&s;elf, and, if he is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of common &s;en&s;e, will avoid the vice which
<PB N="ii" REF="11">
may reduce him to the &s;ituation of the former, and carefully cheri&s;h that virtue which has befriended the latter.</P>
<P>In depicting the manners of a monarch, we may not only admire the &s;hining traits of the character, but al&s;o learn to imitate him in his dome&s;tic virtues: in characters of a lower rank, we all find our&s;elves highly intere&s;ted, and may from every recited fact draw &s;ome u&s;eful in&s;truction.</P>
<P>A Select Sy&s;tem of BIOGRAPHY therefore is and ought to be e&s;teemed a mo&s;t u&s;eful as well as enter|taining publication. And it will be the &s;tudy of the Editor to make choice of &s;uch Lives only as will in|&s;truct the Reader, without proving tedious.</P>

<HEAD>LIFE OF FRANCIS AARSENS.</HEAD>
<P>FRANCIS AARSENS, Lord of Someldyck and Spyck, was one of the greate&s;t mini&s;ters for negociation the United Provinces could ever boa&s;t of. His father, Cornelius Aar&s;ens, was Regi&s;ter to the States; and being acquainted with Mr. Ple&s;&s;is Mornay, at the Court of Wil|liam Prince of Orange, he prevailed upon him to take his &s;on under him, with whom he continued &s;ome years. John Olden Barnevelt, who pre|&s;ided over the affairs of Holland and the United Provinces, &s;ent him afterwards agent into France, where he learned to negociate under tho&s;e profound politicians, Henry IV. Villeroy, Silleri, Ro&s;&s;ie, Jaonnin, &amp;c. and acquitted him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as to attain their approbation. Soon after he was inve&s;ted with the character of an amba&s;&s;ador, being the fir&s;t who was recognized as &s;uch by the French court; at which time Henry IV. declared, that he &s;hould take precedence next to the Vene|tian mini&s;ter. He re&s;ided in France fifteen years; during which time he received great marks of e&s;teem from the king, who created him a knight and baron; and for this rea&s;on he was received among&s;t the nobles of the province of Holland. However, he became at length &s;o odious to the French court, that they de&s;ired to have him recalled. He was afterwards deputed to Venice, and to &s;everal German and Italian princes, upon occa&s;ion of the troubles in Bohemia. He was the fir&s;t of three extraordinary amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent to England in 1620, and the &s;econd in 1641; in which latter emba&s;&s;y he was accompanied by the Lord of Brederode as fir&s;t amba&s;&s;ador, and Heem&s;vliet as third, to treat about the marriage of Prince William, &s;on to the Prince of Orange. He was likewi&s;e amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary at the French court in 1624; and

the Cardinal de Richlieu having ju&s;t taken the admini&s;tration of affairs into his hands, and knowing he was an able man, made u&s;e of him to &s;erve his own purpo&s;e. He died in a very advanced age; and his &s;on, who &s;urvived him, was reputed the wealthie&s;t man in Holland.</P>

<HEAD>ABARIS.</HEAD>
<P>A CELEBRATED &s;age of antiquity, who&s;e hi&s;tory and travels have been the &s;ubject of much learned di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Such a number of fabulous &s;tories were told of him, that Herodotus him&s;elf &s;eems to &s;cruple to relate them. He tells us only, that this Barbarian was &s;aid to have tra|velled with an arrow, and to have taken no &s;u&s;tenance: but does not acquaint us with the marvellous properties which were attributed to that arrow; nor that it had been given him by the Hyperborean Apollo. With regard to the occa&s;ion of his leaving his native country, Harpo|cration tells us, that the whole earth being infe&s;ted with a deadly plague, Apollo, upon being con&s;ulted, gave no other an&s;wer than that the Athenians &s;hould offer up prayers in behalf of all other nations: upon which, &s;everal countries deputed amba&s;&s;adors to Athens, among whom was Abaris the Hyperborean. In this journey, he renewed the alliance between his countrymen and the inhabitants of the i&s;land of Delos. It appears that he al&s;o went to Lacedaemon; &s;ince, according to &s;ome writers, he there built a temple con&s;ecrated to Pro&s;erpine the Salutary. It is a&s;&s;erted, that he was capable of foretelling earthquakes, driving away plagues, laying &s;torms, &amp;c. He wrote &s;everal books, as Suidas informs us. Himerius the &s;ophi&s;t applauds him for &s;peaking pure Greek; which attainment will be no matter of wonder to &s;uch as con&s;ider the ancient intercour&s;e there was between the Greeks and Hy|perboreans. If the Hebrides, or We&s;tern I&s;lands of Scotland (&s;ays Mr. Toland), were the Hyperboreans of Diodorus, then the celebrated Abaris was of that country; and likewi&s;e a Druid, having been the prie&s;t of Apollo. Suidas, who knew not the di&s;tinction of the in&s;ular Hyperboreans, makes him a Scythian; as do &s;ome others, mi&s;led by the &s;ame vulgar error; though Diodorus has truly fixed his country in an i&s;land, and not on the continent. Indeed the fictions and mi&s;takes concerning our Abaris are infinite: however, it is by all agreed that he travelled quite over Greece, and from thence into Italy, where he con|ver&s;ed familiarly with Pythagoras, who favoured him beyond all his di&s;ciples, by in&s;tructing him in his doctrines (e&s;pecially his thoughts of nature) in a more compendious method than he did any other. This di&s;tinction could not but be very advantageous to Abaris. The Hyper|borean in return pre&s;ented the Samian, as though he equalled Apollo him&s;elf in wi&s;dom, with the &s;acred arrow, on which the Greeks have
<PB N="5" REF="14">
fabulou&s;ly related that he &s;at a&s;tride, and flew upon it through the air, over rivers and lakes, fore&s;ts and mountains; in like manner as our vul|gar &s;till believe, particularly tho&s;e of the Hebrides, that wizards and witches fly whither&s;oever they plea&s;e on their broom&s;ticks. The ora|tor Himerius abovementioned, though one of tho&s;e who, from the equivocal &s;en&s;e of the word Hyperborean, &s;eem to have mi&s;taken Abaris for a Scythian, yet de&s;cribes his per&s;on accurately, and gives him a very noble character.
<Q REND="inline">"They relate (&s;ays he) that Abaris the &s;age was by nation an Hyperborean, appeared a Grecian in &s;peech, and re&s;embled a Scythian in his habit and appearance. He came to Athens, holding a bow in his hand, having a quiver hanging on his &s;houlders, his body wrapt up in a plaid, girt about the loins with a gilded belt, and wearing trow&s;ers reaching from his wai&s;t down|ward."</Q>
By this it is evident (continues Mr. Toland) that he was not habited like the Scythians, who were always covered with &s;kins; but appeared in the native garb of an Aboriginal Scot. As to what relates to his abilities, Himerius informs us, that
<Q REND="inline">"he was affable and plea&s;ant in conver&s;ation, in di&s;patching great affairs &s;ecret and in|du&s;trious, quick-&s;ighted in pre&s;ent exigencies, in preventing future dangers circum&s;pect, a &s;earcher after wi&s;dom, de&s;irous of friend|&s;hip, tru&s;ting little to fortune, and having every thing tru&s;ted him for his prudence."</Q>
Neither the Academy nor the Lycaeum could have furni&s;hed a man with fitter qualities to travel &s;o far abroad, and to &s;uch wi&s;e nations, about affairs no le&s;s arduous than important. And if we further attentively con&s;ider his moderation in eating, drinking, and the u&s;e of all tho&s;e things which our natural appetites ince&s;&s;antly crave; joining the candour and &s;implicity of his manners with the &s;olidity and wi&s;dom of his an&s;wers, all which we find &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted; it mu&s;t be owned, that the world at that time had few to compare with Abaris.</P>

<HEAD>ABBADIE (JAMES).</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent Prote&s;tant divine, born at Nay in Bern in 1654; fir&s;t educated there under the famous John la Placette, and afterward at the univer&s;ity of Sedan. From thence he went into Holland and Germany, and was mini&s;ter in the French church at Berlin. He left that place in 1690; came into England; was &s;ome time mini&s;ter of the French church in the Savoy, London; and was made dean of Killaloe in Ire|land. He died at St. Mary le Bonne, near London, in 1727, aged 73. He was &s;trongly attached to the cau&s;e of King William, as appears in his elaborate defence of the revolution, and his hi&s;tory of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination-plot. He had great natural abilities, which he improved by true and u&s;eful learning. He was a mo&s;t zealous defender of the primitive doc|trine
<PB N="6" REF="15">
of the prote&s;tants, as appears by his writings; and that &s;trong ner|vous eloquence, for which he was &s;o remarkable, enabled him to enforce the doctrines of his profe&s;&s;ion from the pulpit with great &s;pirit and energy. He publi&s;hed &s;everal works in French that were much e&s;teemed; the principal of which are, A Treati&s;e on the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion; The Art of Knowing one's Self; A Defence of the Briti&s;h Na|tion; The Deity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the Chri&s;tian Religion; The Hi&s;tory of the la&s;t Con&s;piracy in England, written by order of King William III.; and the Triumph of Providence and Religion, or the opening the Seven Seals by the Son of God.</P>

While his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was pregnant with this &s;on, &s;he is &s;aid to have had a remarkable dream, which proved at once an omen and an in&s;trument of his fortune. She dreamed &s;he was told, if &s;he would eat a jack or pike, the child &s;he went with would prove a &s;on, and ri&s;e to great preferment. Not long after, &s;he accidentally caught a jack in a pail of water taken out of the river Way, and had an opportunity of fulfilling her dream. This &s;tory was much talked of; and coming to the ears of &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion, they offered to become &s;pon&s;ors to the child, which was accepted; and they afterwards &s;hewed many te&s;timonies of their affection to their god&s;on while at &s;chool, and at the univer&s;ity. This is the account given by Mr. Aubrey in his Antiquities of Surry, who &s;eems to have in|quired much about it. When he was of a proper age, he was &s;ent with his elder brother Robert to a free &s;chool, erected by King Edward VI. in their native town of Guilford; and having pa&s;&s;ed through the rudi|ments of literature, he was in 1578 removed to the univer&s;ity of Ox|ford, and entered a &s;tudent in Baliol College.</P>
<P>November 29, 1588, being then bachelor of arts, he was elected pro|bationer fellow of his college, and afterward proceeding in the faculty of arts, he entered into holy orders, and became a celebrated preacher in the univer&s;ity. He commenced bachelor of divinity in 1593, and proceeded doctor in that faculty in May 1597; and in the month of September of the &s;ame year he was elected ma&s;ter of Univer&s;ity College. At this time the fir&s;t differences began between him and Doc|tor Laud, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted as long as they lived, and were the cau&s;e of

great unea&s;ine&s;s to both. In the year 1598, he publi&s;hed a Latin work which did him great honour, and was afterwards reprinted at Frank|fort in Germany; the title <HI>Que&s;tiones &s;ex totidem Praelectionibus in Scholae Theologica Oxoniae pro forma habitis di&s;cu&s;&s;ae et di&s;ceptatae, Anno</HI> 1597. In March 1599, he was in&s;talled dean of Winche&s;ter, in the room of Dr. Heron, who was preferred to the bi&s;hoprick of Ely. He was never dean of Glouce&s;ter, as a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome writers. In 1600 he was vice-chancellor of Oxford, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf while in that high of|fice by the opinion he gave with re&s;pect to refixing the cro&s;s in Cheap&s;ide, about which there were great di&s;putes; but in the end he carried his point again&s;t Dr. Bancroft, then Bi&s;hop of London, which gained him great reputation. He publi&s;hed the &s;ame year his Sermons on the pro|phet Jonah, which were received with great applau&s;e. In 1603 he was again cho&s;en vice-chancellor of the univer&s;ity, and di&s;charged that of|fice with general approbation. The &s;ucceeding year, the tran&s;lation of the Bible, which is now in u&s;e, was made by direction of King James; Dr. Abbot was one of the eight divines in the univer&s;ity of Oxford to whom the care of tran&s;lating part of the New Te&s;tament was committed. He likewi&s;e publi&s;hed this year an an&s;wer to Dr. Hill's Rea&s;ons for up|holding Popery. In 1605, he was a third time vice-chancellor; and the &s;ucceeding year he is &s;aid to have had a &s;hare in the troubles of Laud, who was called to an account by the vice-chancellor, Dr. Ayrey, for a &s;ermon preached before the univer&s;ity: that year he lo&s;t both his father and mother. In 1608, Dr. Abbot's great patron, Thomas Sack|ville Earl of Dor&s;et, lord high trea&s;urer of England, and chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, died &s;uddenly at the council table, at who&s;e fu|neral Dr. Abbot preached a &s;ermon, which was afterwards printed, and generally commended. After his decea&s;e, Dr. Abbot became chaplain to George Earl of Dunbar, trea&s;urer of Scotland, one of King James's early favourites, and who had long a very high &s;hare in his e&s;teem; with him he went this year into Scotland, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the execution of an important de&s;ign, for e&s;tabli&s;hing an union between the churches of the two kingdoms: in this he behaved with &s;uch prudence and mo|deration, as gained him a very high character, and is thought to have been the fir&s;t &s;tep to his future preferment. While he was at Edinburgh a pro&s;ecution was commenced again&s;t George Sprot, a notary of Ay|mouth, for having been concerned in Gowrie's con&s;piracy, eight years before, for which he was tried before Sir William Hart, lord ju&s;tice general of Scotland, condemned and executed. A large account of this affair was drawn up by the judge, and a narrative prefixed thereto by Dr. Abbot, who had been eye-witne&s;s of all that pa&s;&s;ed; this was publi&s;hed at London, in order to &s;ettle the minds of the people with re|gard
<PB N="8" REF="18">
to that con&s;piracy, which had been hitherto looked upon as a very my&s;terious affair. The king well knew the difficulties to be encounter|ed in tho&s;e northern parts, and it gave him a high opinion of the abili|ties of the man who was able to overcome them; and when another &s;et of men rai&s;ed apprehen&s;ions in the king's mind, he had recour&s;e to Dr. Abbot. Thus, when the king was engaged in the mediation of peace between Spain and the United Provinces, he demanded the advice of the convocation then fitting as to the lawfulne&s;s of e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of the States in their claim of independence. The convocation, in&s;tead of &s;atisfying the king's &s;cruples, launched at once into the wide &s;ea of politics: the king wrote a letter on this &s;ubject to Dr. Abbot, which is an inconte&s;tible proof of the confidence he had in him; and the Doctor &s;tood &s;o high in favour, that on the death of Dr. Overton in April 1689, he was, on the king's recommendation, promoted to the united &s;ees of Litchfield and Coventry. But this did not appear to his maje&s;ty a &s;uffi|cient recompence, and therefore in le&s;s than a month he was tran&s;lated to the bi&s;hoprick of London, vacant by the death of Dr. Ravis.</P>
<P>It was but a &s;hort time that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the&s;e bi&s;hopricks, and yet he &s;o remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the diligent performance of his function, by con&s;tant preaching, and by expre&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t readine&s;s to promote learning and learned men, that he obtained a general good character.</P>
<P>While the bi&s;hop was thus employed, a new opportunity offered of the king's te&s;tifying his e&s;teem of, and confidence in him, by the vacan|cy of the archiepi&s;copal &s;ee of Canterbury, on the 2d of November, 1610, on the death of Dr. Bancroft. The court bi&s;hops immediately ca&s;t their eyes upon the celebrated Dr. Andrews, then Bi&s;hop of Ely, and pointed him out to the king as one &s;ufficiently qualified to under|take the government of the church. They thought this recommendation, joined to the king's known regard for this eminent man, enough to &s;e|cure his promotion to the primacy; but without taking the advice of tho&s;e prelates, his maje&s;ty preferred Bi&s;hop Abbot to the throne of Can|terbury, on which he was &s;eated on the 9th of April, 1611, and on the 23d of June following, was &s;worn of his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t honourable privy council: thus we &s;ee him, before he had arrived at the age of fifty, exalted to the highe&s;t dignity in the church.</P>
<P>At this time he was in favour both with prince and people, and ap|pears to have had a con&s;iderable hand in all the great tran&s;actions in church and &s;tate. He was never e&s;teemed very fond of power, or de|&s;irous of carrying his prerogative to an extraordinary height, yet as &s;oon as he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the archbi&s;hoprick, he &s;hewed a &s;teady re&s;olution in the maintenance of the rights of the high commi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="9" REF="19">
court, and would not &s;ubmit to Lord Coke's prohibition: he likewi&s;e &s;hewed his concern for the intere&s;t of the prote&s;tant religion abroad, by pro|curing his maje&s;ty's application to the States General again&s;t Conrade Vor|&s;tius, whom they called to the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of Leyden. In which affair Sir Ralph Winwood was employed; and when it was found difficult to obtain from the States that &s;atisfaction which the king de&s;ired, his grace, in conjunction with the Lord Trea&s;urer Sali&s;bury, framed an expedient for contenting both parties. In all probability this alarmed &s;ome of the warm churchmen at home, who were by no means plea&s;ed with the king's di&s;countenancing abroad tho&s;e opinions which them&s;elves favoured in both univer&s;ities: but whatever their &s;entiments upon this matter might be, Archbi&s;hop Abbot &s;eems to have had as great concern for the church as any one, when he thought it really in danger; this appears by a &s;hort and plain letter of his to Sir Ralph Winwood, about one Mr. Ammiot who had been appointed preacher in the congregation at the Hague; of whom the bi&s;hop &s;ays, that he was very capable to breed up the captains and &s;oldiers there in mutiny and faction, and con&s;equently very unfit for his office. His great concern for the true intere&s;t of religion made him a zealous promoter of the match between the Elector Palatine and the Prince&s;s Elizabeth; and that prince coming here in October 1612, his grace invited the nobility his attendants to an entertainment at his archiepi&s;copal palace at Lambeth, where, though unexpected, the Elector him&s;elf appeared, to &s;hew his great re&s;pect for the archbi&s;hop; and was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his welcome, that when he fea&s;ted the members of the privy council at E&s;&s;ex Hou&s;e, he &s;hewed particular re&s;pect to the archbi&s;hop and tho&s;e who attended him. The fe&s;tivity occa&s;ioned by the arrival of the Elector Palatine, was interrupted for a time by the illne&s;s and death of Henry Prince of Wales, in the 19th year of his age: our prelate had the melancholy office of attending that accompli&s;hed prince in his dying moments, and of preaching his funeral &s;ermon.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth of February following, the marriage of the Elector with the Prince&s;s Elizabeth was &s;olemnized with great &s;plendour, the archbi&s;hop performing the ceremony on a &s;tage erected in the middle of the royal chapel; and his electoral Highne&s;s before his departure, made a pre&s;ent of plate to the archbi&s;hop as a proof of the ju&s;t &s;en&s;e he had of the pains his grace had taken in accompli&s;hing his marriage; and as an additional mark of his confidence, he wrote to him from Canter|bury, relative to the cau&s;es of that di&s;content with which he left England.</P>
<P>The concern his maje&s;ty had &s;hewn for removing Arminius and Vor&s;tius, had given their followers in Holland &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s, that Hugo Grotius, the great champion of their cau&s;e, was &s;ent over to Eng|land
<PB N="10" REF="20">
to endeavour to mitigate the king's di&s;plea&s;ure, and if po&s;&s;ible to give him a better opinion of the Remon&s;trants, as they began to be call|ed; and we have a very &s;ingular account of the man and of his negocia|tion from the pen of our archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1613, the affair of the Charter-hou&s;e was &s;ettled; his grace and the re&s;t of the tru&s;tees took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that place, pur&s;uant to the will of Mr. Sutton. An affair happened about the &s;ame time, which di&s;turbed the primate not a little:&mdash;This was the famous ca&s;e of the divorce between the Lady Francis Howard, daughter to the Earl of Suffolk, and Robert Earl of E&s;&s;ex, her hu&s;band, which has been always con&s;idered as one of the greate&s;t blemi&s;hes of King James's reign, though the part the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury acted, added much to his repu|tation. The circum&s;tances that attended this affair might po&s;&s;ibly le&s;&s;en the king's favour to him in &s;ome re&s;pects, but he &s;till retained a great &s;hare of it, as appears by the rai&s;ing of his brother to the &s;ee of Sali&s;|bury, in the year 1615; but with Queen Anne he &s;tood always on the be&s;t terms. He made u&s;e of his intere&s;t with her maje&s;ty, to engage her to recommend Mr. George Villiers, &s;o well known afterwards, to his maje&s;ty's favour, for which at that time the young man was &s;o grateful as to call him father, and de&s;ire his advice as to his behaviour, which the archbi&s;hop very freely gave him: happy would it have been for him if he had always followed tho&s;e coun&s;els.</P>
<P>Towards the clo&s;e of the next year, the famous Antonio de Dominis, archbi&s;hop of Spalato, took &s;helter here from the per&s;ecution with which he was threatened by the pope, for di&s;covering his di&s;like both of the doctrine and di&s;cipline of the church of Rome, and was very kindly received by his maje&s;ty, who was plea&s;ed to order the archbi&s;hop to entertain him till he was otherwi&s;e provided for by the king.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of the year 1618 our archbi&s;hop lo&s;t his brother the Bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury; and before his grief was well over for &s;o near a rela|tion, he met with fre&s;h di&s;turbance from the king's declaration, for per|mitting &s;ports and pa&s;times on the Lord's day. This declaration was ordered to be read in church, and the archbi&s;hop being at Croydon when it came thither, had the courage to forbid it being read; which however the king winked at, notwith&s;tanding there were &s;ome about him who let no opportunity &s;lip of irritating him again&s;t this prelate: his grace did a great &s;ervice this year to the prote&s;tant religion, by procuring the manu&s;cript of Father Paul's excellent Hi&s;tory of the Council of Trent. The per&s;on employed to negociate the affair was Mr. Nathaniel Brent, who, with no &s;mall hazard to him&s;elf, found means to convey the whole copy &s;afe to England. The end of this year proved as di&s;agreeable to the bi&s;hop as its beginning; in autumn the queen, his gracious mi&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="11" REF="21">
fell ill of that di&s;temper which brought her to her end. The archbi&s;hop him&s;elf began al&s;o to grow infirm; and finding him&s;elf le&s;s fit for the affairs of the world, re&s;olved to enter upon a great and good de&s;ign, which he had long meditated, as a te&s;timony of his regard to his na|tive town of Guilford, where, on the fifth of April, 1619, he was pre&s;ent when Sir Nicholas Kemp laid the fir&s;t &s;tone of his ho&s;pital, which the archbi&s;hop afterward nobly endowed. Towards the end of this year the Elector Palatine accepted the crown of Bohemia, which occa&s;ioned great di&s;putes in the councils of King James; &s;ome de&s;iring that his maje&s;ty &s;hould not interfere in this matter, from a fore&s;ight that it would produce a war in Germany; others again believing that both natural affection to his &s;on and daughter, and a ju&s;t concern for the prote&s;tant intere&s;t ought to have engaged him warmly to &s;upport the new election. The archbi&s;hop agreed in &s;entiment with the la&s;t mentioned party; and not being able at that time to attend the privy council, he wrote his mind with great plainne&s;s and freedom to the &s;ecretary of &s;tate. The next year was in a great mea&s;ure &s;pent in debates and nego|ciations upon this &s;ubject. The archbi&s;hop's declining &s;tate of health making exerci&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for him, he was accu&s;tomed to make a tour in &s;ummer into Hamp&s;hire, and being invited by the Lord Zouch to hunt in his park, he there met with the greate&s;t misfortune that ever befel him; for while hunting, he let fly a barbed arrow from a cro&s;s|bow, at one of the deer, and it unfortunately &s;truck Peter Hawkins, Lord Zouch's keeper, in the left arm, who had been warned more than once to keep out of the way; by which wound a large blood ve&s;&s;el being pierced, he bled to death in an hour's time: this unfore&s;een accident threw the archbi&s;hop into a deep melancholy, though he was not con&s;cious to him&s;elf of the lea&s;t inadvertency or indi&s;cretion; and throughout his whole life he ob&s;erved a monthly fa&s;t on a Tue&s;day, the day on which this fatal accident happened: he al&s;o &s;ettled an annuity of twenty pounds on the widow.</P>
<P>This affair made a very great noi&s;e, and there wanted not &s;ome to repre&s;ent it in a &s;ini&s;ter light to King James; but his maje&s;ty gave his judgment of the matter in a &s;hort and clear &s;entence.&mdash;"An angel, " &s;aid he, "might have mi&s;carried in this &s;ort." When he was after|wards informed of the legal penalties which his grace had incurred by this accident, he wrote him a con&s;olatory letter, in which, among other things, he told him that he would not add affliction to his &s;orrow, or take one farthing from his chattels, which were forfeited by law. The archbi&s;hop immediately retired to his ho&s;pital at Guilford, there to wait the deci&s;ion of the great points, as to the irregularity which &s;ome ima|gined he had incurred; for it happened that at this juncture there were four bi&s;hops elected, but not con&s;ecrated, and all, except Dr. Davenant,
<PB N="12" REF="22">
&s;crupled the archbi&s;hop's capacity to lay hands upon them till he was de|clared free from all imputation as to this fact. The king being informed of this, directed a commi&s;&s;ion to con&s;ider and re&s;olve the three follow|ing que&s;tions: 1. <HI>Whether the archbi&s;hop was irregular by the fact of invo|luntary homicide?</HI> The Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the two judges, and the two civilians, were very clear that he was not irregular, but the other five thought he was. 2. <HI>Whether that act might tend to &s;candal in a church|man?</HI> The Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hobart, and Dr. Steward doubted, all the re&s;t agreed that a &s;candal might be taken, though not given. 3. <HI>How his grace &s;hould be re&s;tored in ca&s;e the king &s;hould fol|low the deci&s;ion of tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners who had found him irregular?</HI> All agreed that could not be otherwi&s;e done than by re&s;titution from the king; but they varied in the manner: &s;ome thought it &s;hould be done by the king, and by him alone, in the &s;ame patent with the pardon; others were for a commi&s;&s;ion from the king directed to &s;ome bi&s;hops; Judge Dodderidge and Sir Henry Martin were de&s;irous it &s;hould be done both ways, for abundant caution. This return was made to his ma|je&s;ty; and accordingly a pardon and a di&s;pen&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed the great &s;eal, by which his maje&s;ty a&s;&s;oiled the archbi&s;hop from all irregula|rity, &amp;c. (if any was incurred) and declared him capable of all metro-political authority. Such was the clo&s;e of this bu&s;ine&s;s, after a great variety of proceedings and many arguments publi&s;hed on both &s;ides. Yet all this could not &s;atisfy the minds of tho&s;e who had &s;crupled his power of laying on hands; they petitioned the king that they might not be compelled to wound their con&s;ciences by &s;ubmitting to &s;uch con|&s;ecration; and in compliance with their de&s;ire, the Bi&s;hop of Lincoln was con&s;ecrated in King Henry the Seventh's chapel, by the Bi&s;hops of London, Worce&s;ter, &amp;c.; and the Bi&s;hop of Sarum, Exeter, and St. David's, in the chapel of the Bi&s;hop of London's palace, by the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It does not appear that his grace was at all le&s;&s;ened in the king's fa|vour, or his courage in any degree abated, by the &s;ugge&s;tions of his enemies; on the contrary we find him, in the year 1622, oppo&s;ing the Spani&s;h match (a thing the king had &s;et his heart upon) with the greate&s;t firmne&s;s, and even venturing to give his &s;entiments under his hand on that &s;ubject in terms vigorous and emphatic. The king however remained fixed in his re&s;olution, and the articles agreed on for the &s;aid marriage were &s;worn to in the pre&s;ence of the archbi&s;hop, and other great officers of &s;tate; notwith&s;tanding which they never took effect. In the parliament that met on the 19th of February 1623-4 our prelate took an active part in the mea&s;ures which were then pur&s;ued for per&s;uading the king to di&s;|&s;olve his treaties with Spain, relating to the marriage and the palatinate. He delivered both the addre&s;s and the remon&s;trance which were pre&s;ent|ed
<PB N="13" REF="23">
to his maje&s;ty from the two Hou&s;es on this occa&s;ion, and introduced the remon&s;trance with a preamble expre&s;&s;ing the joy of the parliament that the king had &s;hewn him&s;elf &s;en&s;ible of the in&s;incerity of the Spa|niards, and of the indignities offered by them to his &s;on and daughter. This part of the preamble appears to have given &s;ome offence to James the Fir&s;t: indeed Dr. Abbot was remarkably zealous in every thing in which the prote&s;tant religion was concerned. The archbi&s;hop thence|forward a&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;eldom at council, being hindered chiefly by his infirmi|ties; but in the king's la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s he was called, and attended with great con&s;tancy, received the highe&s;t marks of the king's confidence, and was near him when he expired.</P>
<P>At the coronation of King Charles the Fir&s;t, the archbi&s;hop &s;et the crown upon his head, though he was extremely weak, and much troubled with the gout. But he vi&s;ibly declined in that monarch's favour; and the Duke of Buckingham, who was his declared enemy, watched an opportunity to make him feel the weight of his di&s;plea&s;ure. This was at la&s;t taken, on his refu&s;ing to licence a &s;ermon preached by one Dr. Sibthorpe, to ju&s;tify and promote a loan which the king had demanded. This &s;ermon was preached at Northampton in the lent a&s;&s;izes 1627, be|fore the judges, and was tran&s;mitted to the bi&s;hop, with the king's di|rection to licence it; which he refu&s;ed to do, and a&s;&s;igned rea&s;ons for it. The &s;ermon was licen&s;ed by the Bi&s;hop of London (Dr. Moun|taigne) after many things had been corrected. It was re&s;olved that he &s;hould &s;uffer. Di&s;cour&s;es of this nature were &s;o loud at court, that &s;ome of his grace's friends reported them to him; upon which he thought fit to retire to his palace at Croydon a month before his u&s;ual time. On the 5th of July, Lord Conway, who was then &s;ecretary of &s;tate, made him a vi&s;it, and intimated to him that the king expected he would withdraw to Canterbury; which the archbi&s;hop declined, becau&s;e he had a law-&s;uit at that time with the city; and de&s;ired he might rather have leave to go to his hou&s;e at Ford, five miles beyond Canterbury, which was yielded to. And on the 9th of October fol|lowing, the king granted a commi&s;&s;ion to the Bi&s;hop of London, &amp;c. to execute archiepi&s;copal authority: the cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned being, that the archbi&s;hop could not at that time in his own per&s;on attend tho&s;e &s;ervices which were proper for his cognizance and juri&s;diction. Some writers have pretended that his &s;uppo&s;ed irregularity, occa&s;ioned by the death of Peter Hawkins, was revived; but the commi&s;&s;ion on record &s;hews the contrary. But the archbi&s;hop did not remain long in this &s;ituation, for the nece&s;&s;ities of the times rendering a parliament nece&s;&s;ary, his grace was &s;ent for about Chri&s;tmas, and not only re&s;tored to his authority and juri&s;diction; but on his coming to court from his palace at Lambeth,
<PB N="14" REF="24">
was received by the Archbi&s;hop of York and the Earl of Dor&s;et, who conducted him to his maje&s;ty; where having ki&s;&s;ed the king's hand, he was de&s;ired not to fail being at the council table twice a week. He &s;at in the parliament which began on the &s;eventeenth of March follow|ing, and continued the full exerci&s;e of his office ever after; of which it may not be ami&s;s to take notice in this &s;ingular in&s;tance:</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of Augu&s;t 1628, he con&s;ecrated Richard Mon|tagu to the &s;ee of Chiche&s;ter, a man who had been remarkably bu&s;y in &s;upporting the pretence of his irregularity, and at this con&s;ecration Dr. Laud, then Bi&s;hop of London a&s;&s;i&s;ted, which is the cleare&s;t proof that no doubts longer remained as to his irregularity, even with tho&s;e who loved him lea&s;t. In parliament the archbi&s;hop maintained his credit in a high degree, and it is more than probable that the knowledge of this procured &s;uch marks of re&s;pect as were at this time afforded him by the court. When the petition of right, that great pillar of the Eng|li&s;h liberty was under con&s;ideration, the archbi&s;hop delivered the &s;en&s;e of the Hou&s;e of Lords thereupon at a conference with the Hou&s;e of Commons; and at the &s;ame time laid before them &s;uch propo&s;itions as their lord&s;hips had agreed upon; for which thanks were returned in a &s;et &s;peech by Sir Dudley Diggs.</P>
<P>When Dr. Manwaring was brought before the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords by impeachment of the Commons, for having maintained in two &s;ermons preached before his maje&s;ty, and afterwards publi&s;hed, that the king's royal will and command in impo&s;ing loans, taxes, and other aids upon his people without common con&s;ent in parliament, did &s;o far bind the con&s;ciences of the &s;ubjects of this kingdom, that they could not refu&s;e the &s;ame without peril of damnation, and that the authority of parliament is not nece&s;&s;ary for the rai&s;ing of aids and &s;ub&s;idies; the archbi&s;hop, by leave of the king, gave the doctor a &s;evere but ju&s;t admonition, and declared that he both di&s;liked and abhorred his two &s;ermons. The intere&s;t of Bi&s;hop Laud was now &s;o great at court that he drew up a &s;cheme of in&s;tructions, which having the king's name at the head of them, were in the month of December 1629 tran&s;mitted to his grace, under the pompous title of His Maje&s;ty's In&s;tructions to the mo&s;t Reverend George Lord Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, containing cer|tain orders to be ob&s;erved and put in execution by the &s;everal bi&s;hops in his province. The&s;e in&s;tructions his grace communicated to his &s;uffragan bi&s;hops, in which he acted mini&s;terially; but to &s;hew that he &s;till meant to exerci&s;e his authority in his own dioce&s;e, he re&s;tored Mr. Palmer and Mr. Unday to their lecture&s;hips after the Dean and Arch|deacon of Canterbury had &s;u&s;pended them, and in other re&s;pects &s;often|ed the rigour of tho&s;e in&s;tructions, which were contrived to enforce the
<PB N="15" REF="25">
particular notions of a prevailing party in the church. His conduct in this and other re&s;pects is &s;aid to have made his pre&s;ence unwelcome at court; and &s;o indeed it &s;eems, for upon the birth of Charles Prince of Wales (afterwards King Charles II.) which happened on the 29th of of May 1630; Laud, then Bi&s;hop of London, had the honour to bap|tize him, as dean of the chapel, notwith&s;tanding the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury is the ordinary of the court, and the king's hou&s;hold, wherever it is, are regarded as his pari&s;hioners, &s;o that this was as much a &s;light upon the archbi&s;hop, as a favour towards his antagoni&s;t. The arch|bi&s;hop however went on doing his duty without fear or favour; and yet one of the la&s;t acts of his life plainly &s;hews that he was very far from being &s;o indifferent towards the di&s;cipline and ceremonies of the church of England as &s;ome have repre&s;ented him: by an order of his dated the 3d of July, 1633, requiring the pari&s;hioners of Crayford in Kent to receive the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper on their knees at the &s;teps a&s;cending to the communion table. A month afterwards, viz. on the 4th of Augu&s;t in the &s;ame year he died at his palace of Croydon, worn out with cares and infirmities, at the age of &s;eventy-one. He was buried, according to his own expre&s;s direction, in the chapel of our Lady, within the church dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in his native town of Guilford. Soon after his decea&s;e a noble monument was erect|ed, with the effigies of the archbi&s;hop in his robes, &s;upported by &s;ix marble pillars of the Doric order, rai&s;ed on pede&s;tals of books piled. On his tomb there is a large Latin in&s;cription to his honour.</P>
<P>The facts above related clearly evince that he was a man of great natural parts; and the&s;e &s;ufficiently improved for the worthy performance of what ever his high &s;tation in the church required. He &s;hewed him&s;elf in many circum&s;tances of his life a man of great moderation towards all parties; a &s;teady friend to the prote&s;tant religion; an hone&s;t though perhaps not an humble courtier; and one who was de&s;irous that the clergy &s;hould have attracted the reverence and e&s;teem of the laity by the &s;anctity of their manners, and the uprightne&s;s of their behaviour, rather than have claimed them as nece&s;&s;arily annexed to their function. The&s;e notions of his &s;quaring little with the humours of &s;ome writers, have drawn upon him many reflections. A late writer, ju&s;tly e&s;teemed for his ex|ten&s;ive knowledge of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, and not &s;o much addicted to party, has done much more ju&s;tice to the virtues and abilities of this great prelate. His charity and public &s;pirit (&s;ays he) ought certainly to have been &s;et in a clearer light than hitherto they have been by the friends to the church. In regard to his learning, &s;ucceeding ages may judge thereof from his writings upon various &s;ubjects. It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that there was another writer, of both his names,

<P>BROTHER to George, was bred to trade, and became an eminent merchant in the city of London; he more particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by an application to the direction of the affairs of the Ea&s;t-India Company, and his earne&s;t attention to whatever might promote the exten&s;ive commerce of this nation, or &s;trengthen the foreign colonies. In this quality, we find him one of the commi&s;&s;ioners employed in the negociation and conclu&s;ion of a treaty with the Dutch Ea&s;t-India com|pany, by which the Molucca I&s;lands and the commerce to them, is de|clared to be two-thirds belonging to the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company, and one to the Engli&s;h. This treaty was concluded at London on the 17th of July, 1619, and ratified by the king the 16th of the &s;ame month, and is as remarkable a tran&s;action as any in that reign. It was in con&s;equence of this treaty, and in order to recover the goods of &s;ome Engli&s;h merchants, that Sir Dudley Diggs and Maurice Abbot were &s;ent over to Holland in the &s;ucceeding year 1620; but with what &s;uc|ce&s;s does not appear. He was afterwards one of the farmers of the cu&s;toms, as appears from a commi&s;&s;ion granted in 1623 to him and to many other per&s;ons, for admini&s;tering the oaths to &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hould either de&s;ire to pa&s;s the &s;eas from this kingdom, or to enter it from foreign countries. In the &s;ucceeding year 1624, he was appointed one of the council for &s;ettling and e&s;tabli&s;hing the colony of Virginia, with very full powers for the government of that colony, as by that commi&s;&s;ion appears.</P>
<P>On the acce&s;&s;ion of King Charles I. to the throne, Mr. Abbot was the fir&s;t per&s;on upon whom he conferred the honour of knighthood; and &s;o great was his intere&s;t at that time in the city, that we find him cho&s;en to the fir&s;t parliament called in that king's reign, viz. in 1625, in conjunction with Sir Thomas Middleton, Sir Heneage Finch, and Mr. Robert Bateman; in 1627 he was one of the &s;heriffs of London with Henry Garway, Sir Cuthbert Hacket being then mayor. About the year 1635, he erected a noble monument to the memory of his brother George, archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, in his native town of Guilford: in 1638 he was lord mayor of London; and died on the tenth of January 1640.&mdash;He was a great lover and encourager of trade, as well as very fortunate therein.</P>

<HEAD>ABBOT (ROBERT),</HEAD>
<P>BROTHER to the two former, was al&s;o born at Guilford, anno 1560, and bred up under the &s;ame &s;chool-ma&s;ter, from whence he was &s;ent to Baliol College, Oxford, in 1575. He took his ma&s;ter's degree in 1582, and became a noted preacher there, al&s;o a con&s;tant lecturer at St. Martin's church in the Quadrivium, and &s;ometimes at Abingdon. His preferment was chiefly owing to his excellence in preaching. Notwith&s;tanding the di&s;tinction which &s;ome wi&s;h to make between the talents and tempers of the&s;e two brothers:&mdash;that George was the more plau&s;ible preacher, Robert the greater &s;cholar; George the abler &s;tate&s;man, Robert the deeper divine; that gravity did frown in George and &s;mile in Robert. Such were the qualities of this Robert, that upon the fir&s;t &s;ermon he preached at Worce&s;ter, he was made lec|turer in that city, and &s;oon after rector of All Saints there: and upon a &s;ermon preached at Paul's-Cro&s;s, he was pre&s;ented to the rich benefice of Bingham, in Nottingham&s;hire, by one of the auditors, John Stan|hope, E&s;q. as Dr. Featly has ob&s;erved in his life. In 1594 he be|came no le&s;s eminent for &s;ome of his writings, particularly again&s;t a cer|tain papi&s;t on the Sacrament; he then took his degrees in divinity, that of doctor being completed in 1597. In the beginning of the reign of King James I. he was made chaplain in ordinary to him; and this king &s;o much e&s;teemed his writings, that when the &s;econd edition of Dr. Abbot's book De Antichri&s;to was publi&s;hed in 1608, his maje&s;ty or|dered his own Commentary upon part of the Apocalyp&s;e to be printed, an honour which that king did to no other of the great clerks in this kingdom: and in truth the doctor's pen had now brought him al&s;o into general e&s;teem; for what he had hitherto publi&s;hed in defence of Wil|liam Perkins's Reformed Catholic, again&s;t Dr. William Bi&s;hop, now a &s;ecular, but afterwards, in the pope's &s;tyle, a titular bi&s;hop of the a&euml;rial dioce&s;e of Chalcedon. It is our author's a&s;&s;ertion, that Dr. Abbot has herein given this William Bi&s;hop as great an overthrow as Jewell to Harding, Bil&s;on to Allen, or Reynolds to Hart. At the end of this excellent work is added, a particular Treati&s;e which he &s;oon after wrote, intitled, The True Ancient Roman Catholic, which he dedi|cated to Prince Henry, to whom it was &s;o acceptable that he returned him many thanks in a letter written with his own hand, and promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon the next vacancy to advance him higher in the church; and though by that prince's untimely death, the doctor lo&s;t &s;ome hopes, yet in the cour&s;e of time his de&s;erts found other friends to do him that ju&s;tice. In 1609 he was unanimou&s;ly elected ma&s;ter of Baliol College; here it is ob&s;erved of him, that he was careful and &s;kil|ful

to &s;et in his nur&s;ery the be&s;t plants, and then took &s;uch care to wa|ter and prune them, that in no plat or knot throughout the univer&s;ity of Oxford there appeared more beautiful flowers, or grew &s;weeter fruit than in Baliol College, while he was ma&s;ter. His diligent read|ing to his &s;cholars, and his continual pre&s;ence at public exerci&s;es, both countenanced the readers and encouraged the hearers. The&s;e re|gulations and improvements he rendered effectual, by e&s;tabli&s;hing piety, which had been much neglected, re&s;toring peace, which had been long wanted, and making temperance more familiar among them, which had been too great a &s;tranger in that &s;ociety. In May 1610 we find him nominated by the king among the fir&s;t fellows of his maje&s;ty's royal college at Chel&s;ea, then newly founded, and de&s;igned as a kind of for|tre&s;s for controver&s;ial divinity, being thus as it were engarri&s;oned with the mo&s;t able and &s;elect champions for the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, again&s;t all a&s;&s;ertors of popery. In November the &s;ame year, he was made preben|dary of Normanton, in the church of Southwell. Upon his preaching a &s;ermon before the king, during his month of waiting at court in 1612, when the news of Dr. Thomas Holland's death was brought from Ox|ford, his maje&s;ty named him &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the theological chair, u&s;ually called the king's profe&s;&s;or of divinity; but he mode&s;tly refu&s;ed the &s;ame, till his brother procured a mandate from the king for him to hold it. Some remarkable circum&s;tances we meet with of him in this &s;tation, and herein he has had the character given him of a profound divine, mo&s;t ad|mirably read in the fathers, councils, and &s;choolmen, and a more mode|rate Calvini&s;t than either of his two predece&s;&s;ors in the divinity chair, Holland and Humphrey, which he expre&s;&s;ed by countenancing the &s;ub|lap&s;arian way of prede&s;tination. La&s;tly, upon the king's peru&s;al of his Antilogia again&s;t the Apology for Garnet; and the &s;ame of his incom|parable Lectures in the univer&s;ity, upon the king's &s;upreme power again&s;t Bellarmine and Suarez (printed after his death), his ma|je&s;ty, when the &s;ee of Sali&s;bury fell void, &s;ent his cong&eacute; d'elire for him to the dean and chapter:&mdash;thus, as he &s;et forward one foot on the temple of honour, though indeed but lei&s;urely, which is imputed to his own humility, the ob&s;truction of his foes who traduced him for a puri|tan (though cordial to the doctrine of the church of England), and to the unwillingne&s;s of &s;ome friends to adorn the church with the &s;poil of the univer&s;ity, and mar a profe&s;&s;or to make a bi&s;hop. He was con&s;ecrated by his own brother the archbi&s;hop on December 3, 1615, in his chapel at Lambeth; herein equalizing the felicity of Seffridus, &s;ome time Bi|&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, who being a bi&s;hop him&s;elf, al&s;o &s;aw his brother at the &s;ame time Archbi&s;hop of Canterbury.

good intentions, in&s;omuch that King James, when the doctor, who was newly con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of Sarum, came to do his homage, &s;aid plea&s;antly to him, Abbot, I have had very much to do to make thee a bi&s;hop, but I know no rea&s;on for it, unle&s;s it were becau&s;e thou ha&s;t written again&s;t one, alluding to the papi&s;h prie&s;t beforementioned. In his way to Sarum he made a farewel oration at the univer&s;ity, with great applau&s;e. We have &s;ome fragments of it pre&s;erved in the original Latin by two authors, and a tran&s;lation thereof or epitome in Engli&s;h, by a third. His brethren, the heads of hou&s;es, and other Oxford friends, parted with him on the edge of his dioce&s;e, with tears of grief; and the gentry of Sarum received him with tho&s;e of joy. He ob&s;erved the beautiful old cathedral to be much decayed through negligence, and the covetou&s;ne&s;s of tho&s;e who filled their pur&s;es with that money which &s;hould have been applied to its repairs: he therefore u&s;ed &s;uch means with the prebenda|ries as drew from them five hundred pounds, which he applied to the reparation of this church, and then laboured to amend the congrega|tion both by doctrine and di&s;cipline, vi&s;iting his whole dioce&s;e in per|&s;on, and preaching every Sabbath day, whil&s;t his health would permit, which was not long, for that &s;edentary cour&s;e to which he had ac|cu&s;tomed him&s;elf, by clo&s;e application to &s;tudy, brought upon him the gravel and &s;tone; but in all the bodily tortures of his la&s;t fit, his &s;oul was at ea&s;e, and his heavenly hopes di&s;po&s;ed him contentedly to re&s;ign all earthly enjoyments.&mdash;He was &s;o far from needing the advice of pa|tience to make the remainder of life &s;upportable, that he gave it to others&punc; even to the judges, who in their circuit came to vi&s;it him on his death bed, he &s;pared not his chri&s;tian admonitions; and be&s;ides his pre|cepts, gave them an example of the comforts that flowed from a clear con&s;cience. And for the inhabitants, he mourned le&s;s to leave the world than they to part with him, who had &s;o much endeared him&s;elf to them, by diligence in his pa&s;toral charge, by his ho&s;pitality and bounty to the poor, and humble carriage to all: having &s;ummoned his dome&s;tics, with de&s;ire to declare his faith, he was per&s;uaded to refrain, it being manife&s;t in his writings. Thus, being quite worn out with exhortations, benedic|tions, and the pains of di&s;ea&s;e, he lay a while in a &s;lumbering &s;tate, and at length, with eyes and hands uplifted for &s;ome &s;pace, departed this life on March 2, 1617, (and not, as &s;ome have mi&s;taken, the year after) in the 58th year of his age, and before he had completely filled this &s;ee two years and three months; being one of the five bi&s;hops which Sali&s;bury &s;aw in &s;ix years.

<HEAD>ABELARD (PETER).</HEAD>
<P>One of the mo&s;t famous doctors of the twelfth century, was born at Palais near Nantz, in Britany: he was well learned in divinity, philo|&s;ophy, and the languages; but was particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by his &s;kill in logic, and fondne&s;s for di&s;putations, which led him to travel into &s;everal provinces in order to give public proofs of his acutene&s;s in that &s;cience.</P>
<P>After having baffled many antagoni&s;ts, he read lectures in divinity with great applau&s;e at Paris; where he boarded with a canon who&s;e name was Fulbert, and who had a very beautiful niece named Heloi&s;e. The canon ardently wi&s;hed to &s;ee this young lady make a figure among the learned, and Abelard was made her preceptor: but in&s;tead of in|&s;tructing her in the &s;ciences, he taught her to love. Abelard now per|formed his public functions very coldly, and wrote nothing but amorous ver&s;es. Heloi&s;e proving with child, Abelard &s;ent her to a &s;i&s;ter of his in Britany, where &s;he was delivered of a &s;on. To &s;often the canon's anger, he offered to marry Heloi&s;e privately; and the old man was bet|ter plea&s;ed with the propo&s;al than the niece; who, from a &s;ingular exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, cho&s;e to be Abelard's mi&s;tre&s;e rather than his wife. She married, however; but u&s;ed often to prote&s;t upon oath that &s;he was &s;ingle, which provoked the canon to u&s;e her ill. Upon this, Abelard &s;ent her to the mona&s;tery of Argenteuil; where &s;he put on a religious habit, but did not take the veil. Heloi&s;e's relations con&s;idering this as a &s;econd treachery, hired ruffians who, forcing into his chamber in the dead of the night, ema&s;culated him. This infamous treatment made him fly to the gloom of a cloi&s;ter. He a&s;&s;umed the mona&s;tic habit in the abbey of St. Dennis; but the di&s;orders of that hou&s;e &s;oon drove him from thence. He was afterwards charged with here&s;y; but after &s;eve|ral

per&s;ecutions for his religious &s;entiments, he &s;ettled in a &s;olitude in the dioce&s;e of Troies, where he built an oratory, to which he gave the name of the Paraclet. He was afterwards cho&s;en &s;uperior of the abbey of Ruis in the dioce&s;e of Vannes: when the nuns being expelled from the nunnery in which Heloi&s;e had been placed, he gave her his ora|tory; where &s;he &s;ettled with &s;ome of her &s;i&s;ter nuns, and became their priore&s;s.</P>
<P>Abelard mixed the philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle with his divinity, and in 1140 was condemned by the council of Rheims and Sens. Pope Inno|cent II. ordered him to be impri&s;oned, his books to be burnt, and forbade him ever teaching again. However, he was &s;oon after pardoned, at the &s;olicitation of Peter the Venerable, who received him into his abbey of Clugni, where he led an exemplary life. He died in the priory of Marcellus at Chalons, April 21, 1142, aged &s;ixty-three. His corp&s;e was &s;ent to Heloi&s;e, who buried it in the Paraclet. He left &s;everal works: the mo&s;t celebrated of which are tho&s;e tender letters that pa&s;&s;ed between him and Heloi&s;e, with the account of their misfortunes pre|fixed; which have been tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, and immortalized by the harmony of Mr. Pope's numbers.</P>

Eu&s;ebius, who believed that this letter was genuine, and al&s;o an an&s;wer our Saviour is &s;aid to have returned to it, has tran&s;lated them both from the Syriac, and a&s;&s;erts that they were taken out of the archives of the city of Ede&s;&s;a. The fir&s;t is as follows:
<Q REND="inline">"Abgarus, prince of Ede&s;&s;a, to Je&s;us the holy Saviour, who hath appeared in the fle&s;h in the con|fines of Jeru&s;alem, greeting. I have heard of thee, and of the cures thou ha&s;t wrought without medicines or herbs. For it is reported thou make&s;t the blind to &s;ee, the lame to walk, lepers to be clean, de|vils and unclean &s;pirits to be expelled, &s;uch as have been long di&s;ea&s;ed to be healed, and the dead to be rai&s;ed; all which when I heard con|cerning thee, I concluded with my&s;elf, That either thou wa&s;t a God come down from heaven, or the &s;on of God &s;ent to do the&s;e things. I have therefore written to thee, be&s;eeching thee to vouch&s;afe to come unto me, and cure my di&s;ea&s;e. For I have al&s;o heard that the Jews u&s;e thee ill, and lay &s;nares to de&s;troy thee. I have here a little city, plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and &s;ufficient for us both. ABGARUS.</Q>
To this letter Je&s;us, it is &s;aid, returned an an&s;wer by Ananias, Abgarus's cou|rier, which was as follows:
<Q REND="inline">Ble&s;&s;ed art thou, O Abgarus! who ha&s;t believed in me whom thou ha&s;t not &s;een; for the Scriptures &s;ay of me, They who have &s;een me have not believed in me, that they who have not &s;een, may, by believing, have life.

<HEAD>ACCIUS.</HEAD>
<P>A LATIN tragic poet, the &s;on of a freedman, and, according to St. Jerom, born in the con&s;ul&s;hip of Ho&s;tilius Mancinus and Attilius Serranus, in the year of Rome 583; but there appears &s;omewhat of confu&s;ion or perplexity in this chronology. He made him&s;elf known before the death of Pacuvius, a dramatic piece of his being exhibited the &s;ame year that Pacuvius brought one upon the &s;tage, the latter being then eighty years of age, and Accius only thirty. We do not know the name of this piece of Accius's, but the titles of &s;everal of his tragedies are mentioned by various authors. He wrote on the mo&s;t celebrated &s;tories which had been repre&s;ented on the Athenian &s;tage; as Andro|mache, Andromeda, Atreus, Clytemne&s;tra, Medea, Meleager, Philo|cletes, the civil wars of Thebes, Tereus, the Troades, &amp;c. He did not always, however, take his &s;ubjects from the Grecian &s;tory; for he com|po&s;ed one dramatic piece wholly Roman: it was intitled Brutus, and related to the expul&s;ion of the Tarquins. It is affirmed by &s;ome, that he al&s;o wrote comedies; which is not unlikely, if he was the author of two pieces, the Wedding and the Merchant, which have been a&s;cribed to him. He did not confine him&s;elf to dramatic writing; for he left other productions, particularly his annals, mentioned by Macrobius, Pri&s;cian, Fe&s;tus, and Nonius Marcellus. He has been cen&s;ured for writing in too har&s;h a &s;tyle. But in all other re&s;pects has been e&s;teemed a very great poet. He was &s;o much e&s;teemed by the public, that a comedian was puni&s;hed for only mentioning his name upon the &s;tage. Cicero &s;peaks in great deri&s;ion of one Accius who had written a hi&s;tory; and, as our author had wrote annals, &s;ome in&s;i&s;t that he is the per&s;on cen&s;ured: but as Cicero him&s;elf, Horace, Quintilian, Ovid, and Paterculus, have &s;poken of our author with &s;o much applau&s;e, we cannot think it is him whom the Roman orator cen&s;ures with &s;o much &s;everity.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o in this age a pretty good orator of the &s;ame name, again&s;t whom Cicero defended Cluentius. He was born in Pi&s;aurum, and perhaps was a relation of our poet.</P>

His mother, it is &s;aid, in order to con&s;ume every mortal part of his body, u&s;ed to lay him every night under live coals, anointing him with ambro&s;ia, which pre&s;erved every part from burning but one of his lips, owing to his having licked it. She dipped him al&s;o in the waters of the river Styx; by which his whole body became invulnerable, except that part of his
<PB N="24" REF="34">
heel by which &s;he held him. But this opinion is not univer&s;al, nor is it a part of his character as drawn by Homer; for in the Iliad (B. xxi. 161.) he is actually wounded in the right arm, by the lance of A&s;teropaus, in the battle near the Scamander. Thetis afterwards intru&s;ted him to the care of the centaur Chiron, who, to give him the &s;trength nece&s;&s;ary for martial toil, fed him with honey and the marrow of lions and wild boars. To prevent his going to the &s;iege of Troy, &s;he di&s;gui&s;ed him in female apparel, and hid him among the maidens at the court of king Ly|comedes: but Uly&s;&s;es di&s;covering him, per&s;uaded him to follow the Greeks. Achilles di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by a number of heroic actions at the &s;iege. Being di&s;gu&s;ted, however, with Agamemnon for the lo&s;s of Bri&s;eis, he retired from the camp. But returning to avenge the death of his friend Patroclus, he &s;lew Hector, fa&s;tened his corp&s;e to his chariot, and dragged it round the walls of Troy. At la&s;t Paris, the brother of Hector, wounded him in the heel with an arrow, while he was in the temple treating about his marriage with Philoxena, daughter to king Priam. Of this wound he died, and was interred on the pro|montary of Sigaeum; and after Troy was taken, the Greeks &s;acrificed Philoxena on his tomb, in obedience to his de&s;ire, that he might enjoy her company in the Ely&s;ian fields. It is &s;aid that Alexander, &s;eeing this tomb, honoured it by placing a crown upon it; at the &s;ame time cry|ing out, that "Achilles was happy in having, during his life, &s;uch a friend at Patroclus, and after his death, a poet like Homer." Achilles is &s;uppo&s;ed to have died 1183 years before the Chri&s;tian aera.</P>

<HEAD>ACIDALIUS (VALENS),</HEAD>
<P>WOULD, in all probability, have been one of the greate&s;t critics in the&s;e latter ages, had he lived longer to perfect tho&s;e talents which na|ture had given him. He was born at Wit&s;tock, in Brandenburg; and having vi&s;ited &s;everal academies in Germany, Italy, and other countries, where he was greatly e&s;teemed, he afterwards took up his re&s;idence at Bre&s;law, the metropolis of Sile&s;ia. Here he remained a con&s;iderable time, in expectation of &s;ome employment; but nothing offering, he turned Roman-catholic, and was cho&s;en rector of a &s;chool at Nie&s;&s;a. It is related, that about four months after, as he was following a proce&s;&s;ion of the ho&s;t, he was &s;eized with a &s;udden phrenzy; and being carried home, expired in a very &s;hort time. But Thuanus tell us, that his exce&s;|&s;ive application to &s;tudy was the occa&s;ion of his untimely death; and that his &s;itting up at night in compo&s;ing his Conjectures on Plautus, brought upon him a di&s;temper which carried him off in three days, on the 25th of May, 1595, being ju&s;t turned of 28. He wrote a Com|mentary on Quintus Curtius, al&s;o Notes on Tacitus, on the Twelve

Panegyrics; be&s;ides &s;peeches, letters, and poems. His poetical pieces are in&s;erted in the <HI>Deliciae</HI> of the German poets, and con&s;i&s;t of epic ver&s;es, odes, and epigrams. A little piece, printed in 1595, under the title of <HI>Mulieres non e&s;&s;e homines,</HI> "That women were not of the human &s;pecies," was fal&s;ely a&s;cribed to him. But the fact was, that Acidalius happening to meet with the manu&s;cript, and thinking it very whim&s;ical, tran&s;cribed it, and give it to the book&s;eller, who printed it. The per|formance was highly exclaimed again&s;t, in&s;omuch that the book&s;eller being &s;eized, he di&s;covered the per&s;on who gave him the manu&s;cript, and a terrible outcry was made again&s;t Acidalius. A &s;tory goes, that being one day to dine at a friend's hou&s;e, there happened to be &s;everal ladies at table; who &s;uppo&s;ing him to be the author, were moved with &s;o much indignation, that they threatened to throw their plates at his head.

<P>ONE of the writers of the Byzantine hi&s;tory, was born at Con&s;tan|tinople, in the year 1220, and brought up at the court of the emperor John Ducas, at Nice. He was employed in the mo&s;t important affairs of the empire, being &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to Lari&s;&s;a, to e&s;tabli&s;h a peace with Michael of Epirus; and was con&s;tituted judge to try Michael Comnenus, &s;u&s;pected of engaging in a con&s;piracy. Theodorus La&s;|caris, the &s;on of John, whom he had taught logic, appointed him governor of all the we&s;tern provinces in his empire.

<HEAD>ACUNA (CHRISTOPHER DE).</HEAD>
<P>A SPANISH Je&s;uit, born at Burgos. He was admitted into the &s;ociety in 1612, being then but 15 years of age. After having devoted &s;ome years to &s;tudy, he went to America, where he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in making converts in Chili and Peru. In 1640, he returned to Spain, and gave the king an account how far he had &s;ucceeded in the commi&s;&s;ion he had received to make di&s;coveries on the river of the Amazons; and the year following he publi&s;hed a de&s;cription of this river, at Madrid. Acuna was &s;ent to Rome as procurator of his province. He returned to Spain with the title of Qualificator of the Inqui&s;ition; but &s;oon after embarked again for the We&s;t Indies, and was at Lima in 1675, when father Southwell publi&s;hed at Rome the Bibliotheque of the Je&s;uit writers. Acuna's work is intitled, <HI>Nuevo de&s;cubrimento del gran rio de las Amazonas; i. e.</HI> "A new di&s;covery of the great river of the Amazons." He was ten months upon this river, having had in&s;tructions to inquire into every thing with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s, that his maje&s;ty might thereby be enabled to render the navigation more ea&s;y and commodious. He went aboard a &s;hip at Quito, with Peter Texiera, who had already been far up the river, and was therefore thought a proper per&s;on to accom|pany him in this expedition. They embarked in February 1639, but did not arrive, at Para till the December following. It is thought that the revolutions of Portugal, by which the Spaniards lo&s;t Brazil, and the colony of Para at the mouth of the river of the Amazons, were the cau&s;es that the relation of this Je&s;uit was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; for as it could not be of any advantage to the Spaniards, they were afraid it might prove of great &s;ervice to the Portugue&s;e. The copies of this work became ex|tremely &s;carce, &s;o that the publi&s;hers of the French tran&s;lations at Paris a&s;&s;erted, that there was not one copy of the original extant, excepting that in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the tran&s;lator; and, perhaps, one in the Vatican library. M. de Gomberville was the author of this tran&s;lation: it was publi&s;hed after his death, with a long di&s;&s;ertation. An account of the original may be &s;een in the Paris Journal, in that of Leip&s;ic, and in Chevereau's Hi&s;tory of the World.</P>

<P>CITIZEN, and lord-mayor of London, was a man highly e&s;teem|ed for his prudence and piety, his loyalty and &s;ufferings, and his acts of munificence: he was born at Wem, in Shrop&s;hire, educated in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, and (Fuller &s;ays) bred a draper in London. In 1609 he was cho&s;en &s;heriff, when he gave a &s;triking proof of his public &s;pirit; he immediately gave up his bu&s;ine&s;s, and applied him&s;elf wholly to

public affairs&mdash;This &s;hews he mu&s;t have been opulent. He made him&s;elf complete ma&s;ter of the cu&s;toms and u&s;ages, rights and privileges, of the city of London, and &s;ucceeded to every honour his fellow-citizens had it in their power to be&s;tow. He was cho&s;en ma&s;ter of the drapers com|pany, alderman, and pre&s;ident of Saint Thomas's ho&s;pital, which in|&s;titution he probably &s;aved from ruin, by di&s;covering the frauds of a di&s;|hone&s;t &s;teward. He was often returned member of parliament; but the violent politics of the times would not permit him to &s;it there. In 1645 he was elected mayor of London, in which office he gave a &s;hining example of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, by declining the advantages u&s;ually made by the &s;ale of places which become vacant. His loyalty to Charles I. was &s;o well known, that his hou&s;e was &s;earched by the republican party to find the king there. Mr. Adams was the next year committed to the Tower by the &s;ame party, and detained there &s;ome time. However, at length he became the olde&s;t alderman upon the bench, and was con&s;equently dig|nified with the honourable title of Father of the City. His affection for his prince was &s;o great, that during the exile of Charles II. he remitted him 10,000l.</P>
<P>When the re&s;toration of the king was agreed on, Mr. Adams, then &s;eventy-four years of age, was deputed by the city to accompany Gen. Monk to Breda in Holland, to congratulate and accompany the king home. For his &s;ignal &s;ervices the king knighted him at the Hague; and &s;oon after the re&s;toration advanced him to the dignity of a baronet, on the 13th of June 1661.</P>
<P>His merit as a benefactor to the public is highly con&s;picuous: he gave the hou&s;e of his nativity, at Wem, as a free-&s;chool to the town, and liberally endowed it; he founded an Arabic profe&s;&s;or&s;hip at Cam|bridge; both which took place before his death. By de&s;ire of his friend, Mr. Wheelock, fellow of Clare-hall, he was at the expence of printing the Go&s;pels in Per&s;ian, and &s;ending them into the Ea&s;t. He was equally benevolent in private as in public life; his hands were open to all ob|jects in want: and although he &s;uffered great lo&s;&s;es in his e&s;tate, he gave liberally in legacies to the poor of many pari&s;hes, to ho&s;pitals, and mi|ni&s;ters' widows. He was particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for his Chri&s;tian pa|tience and fortitude in adver&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>ADAMSON (PATRICK),</HEAD>
<P>ARCHBISHOP of St. Andrew's, was born March 15, 1543, in the town of Perth, of mean but hone&s;t parents, who gave him all the learning they were able, having him educated at a grammar-&s;chool where they dwelt, and &s;ent him from thence to St. Andrew's, where he acquired the degree of ma&s;ter of arts. Their circum&s;tances not permitting them to keep him longer there, he removed to a little village of Fife, where he taught a &s;chool with reputation, and continued four years; when he ac|companied the &s;on of Mr. M'Gill, of Rankellar, one of the &s;enators of the college of ju&s;tice, to Paris in 1566, to &s;tudy the civil law. Here he publi&s;hed a congratulatory poem on the birth of a &s;on to Mary queen of Scots, wherein he &s;tyles Henry Lord Darnley, king of Scotland, Eng|land, and France. The giving the title of king of France and England to his own prince &s;o much alarmed the French court, that he was thrown into pri&s;on, and would not ea&s;ily have e&s;caped, had not his queen, and the fir&s;t nobility of the kingdom, intere&s;ted them&s;elves in his behalf. As &s;oon as he was at large, he retired with his pupil to Bourges, where they both entered &s;tudents at law. He was in that city during the ma&s;|&s;acre of Paris; and as the &s;ame &s;cene was tran&s;acting there, he was ob|liged to conceal him&s;elf at a public hou&s;e for &s;even months. Here he wrote two excellent pieces in Latin ver&s;e, which are &s;till extant. In 1573, he returned to Scotland, and married. Finding no encourage|ment in the law, he entered into holy orders, and became mini&s;ter of Pai&s;ley.</P>
<P>In a general a&s;&s;embly, held the &s;ucceeding year at Edinburgh, he, with Mr. David Lind&s;ay, were appointed to report their proceedings to the Earl of Morton, then regent; and was by that nobleman, in the &s;ame year, appointed one of his chaplains; who in the &s;ame year, on the death of Bi&s;hop Douglas, rai&s;ed him to be archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's, a dignity in which he experienced nothing but trouble and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>On October 24, 1576, the general a&s;&s;embly &s;at, and required Mr. Adam&s;on to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to their examination, and to receive the office of bi&s;hop with &s;uch limitations as they thought fit. This he re|fu&s;ed; and they forbad the chapter of St. Andrew's to proceed to any election. The chapter, however, after the a&s;&s;embly ro&s;e, elected Mr. Adam&s;on. Next year the a&s;&s;embly appointed commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;ummon the archbi&s;hop before them to examine the validity of the election, and to take cognizance of various charges brought again&s;t him. The pre&s;by|terian
<PB N="29" REF="39">
party ran high again&s;t him, and the unfortunate prelate, to &s;oothe the pa&s;&s;ions of the&s;e angry men, compo&s;ed a catechi&s;m in Latin ver&s;e. This they &s;aw and approved, but &s;till continued to per&s;ecute him. In 1578, he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the general a&s;&s;embly; but next year a new commi&s;&s;ion was i&s;&s;ued to inquire into fre&s;h charges again&s;t him, when he retired to St. Andrew's, and continued di&s;puting with them for &s;ome years, being pre&s;erved from de&s;truction by the power of the court.</P>
<P>In 1582, he was &s;eized with a di&s;temper, which his phy&s;icians could not find out, and therefore could not afford him relief. He applied then to an old woman, who did him &s;ome &s;ervice; but &s;o infatuated were his enemies, that they accu&s;ed the poor woman of witchcraft, who was committed to pri&s;on, but made her e&s;cape. Four years after &s;he was taken at Edinburgh, and was ab&s;olutely burned for what &s;he ought to have been rewarded, the &s;aving the archbi&s;hop's life.</P>
<P>In 1583, he preached and di&s;puted before King James when he went to St. Andrew's, and the king was &s;o well &s;atisfied with his wi&s;dom and loyalty, that he &s;ent him as his amba&s;&s;ador to London to Queen Eliza|beth, in which quality he re&s;ided &s;ome years. His conduct, while there, has been variou&s;ly &s;poken of. However, by his preaching, he drew &s;uch large congregations, and rai&s;ed in the minds of the people &s;uch an idea of the young king his ma&s;ter, that Elizabeth prohibited his entering the pulpit. Two things he principally endeavoured to effect, to recom|mend the king his ma&s;ter to the nobility and gentry of England, and to procure &s;ome &s;upport for the epi&s;copal party in Scotland; in both which he in &s;ome degree &s;ucceeded. But his want of economy prevented his full &s;ucce&s;s. This drew on him the reflections of his enemies. As to his being concerned in Throgmorton's con&s;piracy, no &s;ub&s;tantial proof of it has been brought.</P>
<P>Soon after Gourie's con&s;piracy he was recalled, and &s;at in the par|liament at Edinburgh in 1584. The act therein made for &s;ettling the peace of the kingdom, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the king's authority in eccle&s;i|a&s;tical affairs, had but little effect; the mini&s;ters refu&s;ed obedience; and becau&s;e the archbi&s;hop preached before the king, libels were publi&s;hed again&s;t him; and notwith&s;tanding a declaration publi&s;hed by the king, &s;etting forth the rea&s;ons which induced him to enact tho&s;e laws, the kirk faction were &s;o ob&s;tinate and indefatigable as to oblige the king to di&s;|avow his declaration.</P>
<P>At a provincial &s;ynod in 1586, the archbi&s;hop was accu&s;ed and ex|communicated. He appealed to the king and &s;tates of the kingdom, and in return excommunicated Mr. Melvil, the moderator. The mob were &s;o enraged at this, that he dared not appear as moderator. At the next a&s;&s;embly in the &s;ame year he &s;ubmitted, and was ab&s;olved.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="40">In 1587, complaint was made to the general a&s;&s;embly, and he was actually <HI>put to the horn,</HI> that is, outlawed, becau&s;e he did not pay his debts. In 1588. he was accu&s;ed of marrying the Earl of Huntley with|out requiring him to &s;ub&s;cribe a confe&s;&s;ion of faith. He publi&s;hed &s;oon after the Lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah in Latin ver&s;e, and a tran&s;lation of the Apocalyp&s;e al&s;o in Latin ver&s;e; but neither tho&s;e, or a copy of ver&s;es written to the king when in deep di&s;tre&s;s, could procure him any favour. On the contrary, the king finding him no longer of u&s;e to him, granted the revenue of his &s;ee to the Duke of Lenox. This reduced him to greater di&s;tre&s;s, and the brethren taking advantage of it, procured his &s;ub&s;cription to a mo&s;t abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by giving him a poor collection for the immediate &s;upport of his family. In this &s;tate he lingered till 1591, when death put a period to his misfortunes.</P>

<P>WAS the &s;on of a clergyman, and born at Mouldi&s;meaburne, near Cro&s;by Raven&s;worth in We&s;tmoreland, in 1632. He received the fir&s;t tincture of letters at the grammar-&s;chool at Appleby, and in 1650 was &s;ent to Queen's college, Oxford, where he became fir&s;t a poor child on the foundation; but quickly di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by his lively parts and &s;trict application to learning, in 1654 he was admitted bachelor, and in 1657 ma&s;ter of arts; and being then much noticed for his &s;prightly wit, was made choice of for one of the <HI>Terrae Filii</HI> for the act celebrated in 1658. But his loyalty getting the better of his prudence, in his oration he was &s;o &s;evere on the pride, hypocri&s;y, ignorance, and avarice of tho&s;e in power, that he was compelled to make a recantation, and a&s;k pardon on his knees. Shortly after he left the univer&s;ity: he cho&s;e for his retreat the village of Petworth, and &s;pent his time in vi&s;it|ing gentlemen of known loyalty, who had &s;eats in the county of Su&s;&s;ex, where he endeavoured to promote among the youth principles of loyalty.</P>
<P>On the re&s;toration, the gentlemen of that county recommended him to Dr. King, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, as a man of a &s;ound head and hone&s;t heart, and one who had &s;uffered much for the con&s;titution in church and &s;tate. The bi&s;hop probably would have provided for him, if Mr. Ad|di&s;on had not accepted the po&s;t of chaplain to the garri&s;on of Dunkirk contrary to his lord&s;hip's inclination. When that place was delivered up to the French in 1662, he returned to England, and was &s;oon after made chaplain to the garri&s;on of Tangier, whither he went in the next year.

<P>Soon after his arrival, he was made chaplain in ordinary to King Charles II. but the chaplain&s;hip of Tangier was taken from him, and given to another, by which Mr. Addi&s;on's circum&s;tances were much &s;traitened.

The preferments he now enjoyed enabled him to live decently and ho&s;pitably in the country, where he di&s;charged his duty with a con&s;cientious diligence, and lived on terms of friend&s;hip with the mo&s;t eminent per&s;ons in the neighbourhood.</P>

<P>In the year 1687, Dr. Lanca&s;ter, dean of Magdalen college, having by ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;een a Latin poem of Mr. Addi&s;on's, was &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that he immediately got him elected into that hou&s;e, where he took his degrees of bachelor and ma&s;ter of arts. His Latin pieces in the cour&s;e of a few years were exceedingly admired in both univer&s;ities; nor were they le&s;s e&s;teemed abroad, particularly by the celebrated Boileau, who is reported to have &s;aid, that he would not have written again&s;t Perrault, had he before &s;een &s;uch excellent pieces by a modern hand. He publi&s;hed nothing in Engli&s;h before the twenty-&s;econd year of his age; when there appeared a &s;hort copy of ver&s;es written by him, and addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Dryden, which procured him great reputation from the be&s;t judges. This was &s;oon followed by a tran&s;lation of the Fourth Georgic of Virgil (omitting the &s;tory of Ari&s;taeus), much commended by Mr. Dryden. He wrote al&s;o the E&s;&s;ay on the Georgics, prefixed to Mr. Dryden's tran&s;lation. There are &s;everal other pieces written by him about this time; among&s;t the re&s;t, one dated the 3d of April 1694, addre&s;&s;ed to H. S. that is, Dr. Sacheverell, who became afterwards &s;o famous, and with whom Mr. Addi&s;on lived once in the greate&s;t friend|&s;hip; but their intimacy was &s;ome time after broken off by their di&s;|agreement in political principles. In the year 1695, he wrote a poem to King William on one of his campaigns, addre&s;&s;ed to Sir John Somers, lord keeper of the great &s;eal. This gentleman received it with great plea&s;ure, took the author into the number of his friends, and be&s;towed on him many marks of his favour.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on had been clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed, while at the univer&s;ity, to en|ter into holy orders; and had once re&s;olved upon it: but his great mo|de&s;ty, his natural diffidence, and an uncommonly delicate &s;en&s;e of the importance of the &s;acred function, made him afterwards alter his re&s;o|lution; and having expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to travel, he was encouraged thereto by his patron abovementioned, who by his intere&s;t procured him from the crown a pen&s;ion of 300l. <HI>per annum</HI> to &s;upport him in his travels. He accordingly made a tour to Italy in the year 1699; and, in 1701, he wrote a poetical epi&s;tle from Italy to the Earl of Halifax, which has been univer&s;ally e&s;teemed as a mo&s;t excellent performance. It was tran&s;lated into Italian ver&s;e by the Abbot Antonio Maria Salvini, Greek profe&s;&s;or at Florence. In the year 1705, he publi&s;hed an account of his travels, dedicated to Lord Somers; which, though at fir&s;t but in|differently received, yet in a little time met with its de&s;erved applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="43">In the year 1702, he was about to return to England, when he re|ceived advice of his being appointed to attend Prince Eugene, who then commanded for the emperor in Italy: but the death of king William happening &s;oon after, put an end to this affair as well as his pen&s;ion; and he remained for a con&s;iderable time unemployed. An unexpected incident at once rai&s;ed him, and gave him an opportunity of exerting his fine talents to advantage: for in the year 1704, the lord trea&s;urer Godolphin happened to complain to Lord Halifax, that the Duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim had not been celebrated in ver&s;e in the manner it de&s;erved; and intimated, that he would take it kindly, if his lord&s;hip, who was the known patron of the poets, would name a gentleman capable of doing ju&s;tice to &s;o elevated a &s;ubject. Lord Halifax replied, &s;omewhat ha&s;tily, that he did know &s;uch a per&s;on, but would not mention him; adding, that long had he &s;een, with in|dignation, men of no merit maintained in luxury at the public expence, whil&s;t tho&s;e of real worth and mode&s;ty were &s;uffered to langui&s;h in ob|&s;curity. The trea&s;urer an&s;wered very coolly, that he was &s;orry there &s;hould be occa&s;ion for &s;uch an ob&s;ervation, but that he would do his endeavour to wipe off &s;uch reproaches for the future; and he engaged his honour, that whoever his lord&s;hip named, as a per&s;on capable of ce|lebrating this victory, &s;hould meet with a &s;uitable recompence. Lord Halifax thereupon named Mr. Addi&s;on; in&s;i&s;ting, however, that the trea&s;urer him&s;elf &s;hould &s;end to him; which he promi&s;ed. Accordingly he prevailed on Mr. Boyle (afterwards Lord Carlton) then chancellor of the exchequer, to make the propo&s;al to Mr. Addi&s;on; which he did in &s;o polite a manner, that our author readily undertook the ta&s;k. The lord trea&s;urer had a &s;ight of the piece, when it was carried no farther than the celebrated &s;imile of the angel; and was &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that he immediately appointed Mr. Addi&s;on a commi&s;&s;ioner of appeals, va|cant by the promotion of Mr. Locke, cho&s;en one of the lords commi&s;|&s;ioners for trade. The Campaign is addre&s;&s;ed to the Duke of Marlbo|rough; it gives a &s;hort view of the military tran&s;actions in 1704, and contains a noble de&s;cription of the two great actions at Schellemberg and Blenheim. In 1705, he attended Lord Halifax to Hanover; and the en&s;uing year was appointed under-&s;ecretary to Sir Charles Hedges, &s;ecretary of &s;tate; in which office he acquitted him&s;elf &s;o well, that the Earl of Sunderland, who &s;ucceeded Sir Charles in December, continued Mr. Addi&s;on in his employment.</P>
<P>A ta&s;te for operas beginning at this time to prevail in England, and many per&s;ons having &s;olicited Mr. Addi&s;on to write one, he complied with their reque&s;t, and compo&s;ed his Ro&s;amond. This, however, whe|ther from the defect of the mu&s;ic, or from the prejudices in favour of

the Italian ta&s;te, did not &s;ucceed upon the &s;tage; but the poetry of it has, and always will be, ju&s;tly admired. About this time, Sir Richard Steele compo&s;ed his comedy of the Tender Hu&s;band, to which Mr. Ad|di&s;on wrote a prologue. Sir Richard &s;urprized him with a dedication of this play, and acquainted the public, that he was indebted to him for &s;ome of the mo&s;t excellent &s;trokes in the performance. The Marquis of Wharton, being appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1709, took Mr. Addi&s;on with him as his &s;ecretary. Her Maje&s;ty al&s;o made him keeper of the records of Ireland, and, as a farther mark of her favour, con&s;i|derably augmented the &s;alary annexed to that place. Whil&s;t he was in this kingdom, the Tatler was fir&s;t publi&s;hed; and he di&s;covered his friend Sir Richard Steele to be the author, by an ob&s;ervation on Virgil, which he had communicated to him. He afterwards a&s;&s;i&s;ted con&s;idera|bly in carrying on this paper, which the author acknowledges. The Tatler being laid down, the Spectator was &s;et on foot, and Mr. Addi&s;on furni&s;hed great part of the mo&s;t admired papers. The Spectator made its fir&s;t appearance in March 1711, and was brought to a conclu&s;ion in September 1712.</P>
<P>His celebrated Cato appeared in 1713. He formed the de&s;ign of a tragedy upon this &s;ubject when he was very young, and wrote it when on his travels: he retouched it in England, without any intention of bringing it on the &s;tage; but his friends being per&s;uaded it would &s;erve the cau&s;e of liberty, he was prevailed on by their &s;olicitations, and it was accordingly exhibited on the theatre, with a prologue by Mr. Pope, and an epilogue by Dr. Garth. It was received with the mo&s;t uncom|mon applau&s;e, having run thirty-five nights without interruption. The Whigs applauded every line in which liberty was mentioned, as a &s;atire on the Tories; and the Tories echoed every clap, to &s;how that the &s;atire was unfelt. When it was printed, notice was given that the queen would be plea&s;ed if it was dedicated to her; "but as he had de&s;igned that compliment el&s;ewhere, he found him&s;elf obliged," &s;ays Tickell, "by his duty on the one hand, and his honour on the other, to &s;end it into the world without any dedication." It was no le&s;s e&s;teemed abroad, having been tran&s;lated into French, Italian, and German; and was acted at Leghorn, and &s;everal other places, with va&s;t applau&s;e. The Je&s;uits of St. Omers made a Latin ver&s;ion of it, and the &s;tudents acted it with great magnificence.</P>
<P>About this time, another paper called the Guardian was publi&s;hed by Steele, to which Addi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n was a principal contributor. It was a conti|nuation of the Spectator, and was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame elegance and the &s;ame variety; but, in con&s;equence of Steele's propen&s;ity to poli|tics, was abruptly di&s;continued in order to write the Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="45">The papers of Addi&s;on are marked in the Spectator by one of the letters in the name of <HI>Clio,</HI> and in the Guardian by a <HI>Hand.</HI> Many of the&s;e papers were written with powers truly comic, with nice di&s;crimi|nation of characters, and accurate ob&s;ervation of natural or accidental deviations from propriety: but it was not &s;uppo&s;ed that he had tried a comedy on the &s;tage, till Steele, after his death, declared him the au|thor of "The Drummer." This, however, he did not know to be true by any cogent te&s;timony: for when Addi&s;on put the play into his hands, he only told him it was the work of a gentleman in the com|pany; and when it was received, as is confe&s;&s;ed, with cold di&s;appro|bation, he was probably le&s;s willing to claim it. Tickell omitted it in his collection; but the te&s;timony of Steele, and the total &s;ilence of any other claimant, has determined the public to a&s;&s;ign it to Addi&s;on, and it is now printed with his other poetry. Steele carried "The Drummer" to the playhou&s;e, and afterwards to the pre&s;s, and &s;old the copy for 50 guineas. To Steele's opinion may be added the proof &s;upplied by the play it&s;elf, of which the characters are &s;uch as Addi&s;on would have de|lineated, and the tendency &s;uch as Addi&s;on would have promoted.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that Mr. Addi&s;on intended to have compo&s;ed an Engli&s;h dictionary upon the plan of the Italian (Della Cru&s;ca); but, upon the death of the queen, being appointed &s;ecretary to the lords ju&s;tices, he had not lei&s;ure to carry on &s;uch a work. When the Earl of Sunderland was appointed lord lieutenant of Ireland, Mr. Addi&s;on was again made &s;ecretary for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> affairs of that kingdom; and, upon the earl's being re|moved from the lieutenancy, he was cho&s;en one of the lords of trade.</P>
<P>Not long afterwards an attempt was made to revive the Spectator, at a time indeed by no means favourable to literature, when the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a new family to the throne filled the nation with anxiety, di&s;cord, and confu&s;ion; and either the turbulence of the times, or the &s;atiety of the readers, put a &s;top to the publication, after an experiment of 80 numbers, which were afterwards collected into an eighth volume, per|haps more valuable than any of tho&s;e that went before it: Addi&s;on pro|duced more than a fourth part.</P>
<P>In 1715, he began the Freeholder, a political paper, which was much admired, and proved of great u&s;e at that juncture. He publi&s;hed al&s;o, about this time, ver&s;es to Sir Godfrey Kneller upon the king's picture, and &s;ome to the Prince&s;s of Wales with the tragedy of Cato.</P>
<P>Before the arrival of King George he was made &s;ecretary to the re|gency, and was required by his office to &s;end notice to Hanover that the queen was dead, and that the throne was vacant. To do this would not have been difficult to any man but Addi&s;on, who was &s;o overwhelmed with the greatne&s;s of the event, and &s;o di&s;tracted by choice of expre&s;&s;ion,

that the lords, who could not wait for the niceties of critici&s;m, called Mr. Southwell, a clerk in the hou&s;e, and ordered him to di&s;patch the me&s;&s;age. Southwell readily told what was nece&s;&s;ary, in the common &s;tyle of bu&s;ine&s;s, and valued him&s;elf upon having done what was too hard for Addi&s;on.</P>
<P>In 1716, he married the Counte&s;s Dowager of Warwick, whom he had &s;olicited by a very long and anxious court&s;hip. He is &s;aid to have fir&s;t known her by becoming tutor to her &s;on. The marriage, if un|contradicted report can be credited, made no addition to his happine&s;s; it neither found them nor made them equal. She always remembered her own rank, and thought her&s;elf intitled to treat with very little cere|mony the tutor of her &s;on. It is certain that Addi&s;on has left behind him no encouragement for ambitious love. The year after, 1717, he ro&s;e to his highe&s;t elevation, being made &s;ecretary of &s;tate; but is repre|&s;ented as having proved unequal to the duties of his place. In the hou&s;e of commons he could not &s;peak, and therefore was u&s;ele&s;s to the defence of the government. In the office he could not i&s;&s;ue an order without lo&s;ing his time in que&s;t of fine expre&s;&s;ions. At la&s;t, finding by experi|ence his own inability for public bu&s;ine&s;s, he was forced to &s;olicit his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, with a pen&s;ion of 1500l. a year. Such was the account of tho&s;e who were inclined to detract from his abilities; but by others his relinqui&s;hment was attributed to declining health, and the nece&s;&s;ity of rece&s;s and quiet.</P>
<P>In his retirement, he wrote his Evidences of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which he had begun long before; part of which, &s;carce fini&s;hed, has been printed in his works. He intended al&s;o to have given an Engli&s;h paraphra&s;e of &s;ome of David's p&s;alms. But his ailments increa&s;ed, and cut &s;hort his de&s;igns. He had for &s;ome time been oppre&s;&s;ed by an a&s;thmatic di&s;order, which was now aggravated by a drop&s;y, and he prepared to die con|formably to his precepts and profe&s;&s;ions. He &s;ent, as Mr. Pope relates, a me&s;&s;age by the Earl of Warwick to Mr. Gay, de&s;iring to &s;ee him: Gay, who had not vi&s;ited him for &s;ome time before, obeyed the &s;um|mons, and found him&s;elf received with great kindne&s;s. The purpo&s;e for which the interview had been &s;olicited was then di&s;covered: Addi|&s;on told him, that he had injured him; but that, if he recovered, he would recompen&s;e him. What the injury was he did not explain, nor did Gay ever know; but &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;ome preferment de&s;igned for him had by Addi&s;on's inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ention been withheld.&mdash;Another death-bed in|terview, of a more &s;olemn nature, is recorded: Lord Warwick was a young man of ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> irregular life, and perhaps of loo&s;e opinions. Addi|&s;on, for whom he did not want re&s;pect, had very diligently endeavoured to reclaim him; but his arguments and expo&s;tulations had no effect:
<PB N="37" REF="49">
one experiment, however, remained to be tried. When he found his life near its end, he directed the young lord to be called; and when he de&s;ired, with great tenderne&s;s, to hear his la&s;t injunctions, told him, "I have &s;ent for you that you may &s;ee how a Chri&s;tian can die.' What effect this aweful &s;cene had on the earl's behaviour is not known; he died him&s;elf in a &s;hort time. Having given directions to Mr. Tickell for the publication of his works, and dedicated them on his death-bed to his friend Mr. Craggs, he died June 17, 1719, at Holland-hou&s;e, leaving no child but a daughter who is &s;till living.</P>
<P>Addi&s;on's cour&s;e of life before his marriage has been detailed by Pope. He had in the hou&s;e with him Budgell, and perhaps Philips. His chief companions were Steele, Budgell, Philips, Carey, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ant, and Colonel Brett. With one or other of the&s;e he always breakfa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. He &s;tudied all morning; then dined at a tavern, and went afterwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds to Button's. From the coffee-hou&s;e he went again to the tavern, where he often &s;at late, and drank too much wine.</P>
<P>Dr. John&s;on, in delineating the character of Addi&s;on, ob&s;erves with Tickell, that he employed wit on the &s;ide of virtue and religion. He not only made the proper u&s;e of wit him&s;elf, but taught it to others; and from his time it has been generally &s;ub&s;ervient to the cau&s;e of rea|&s;on and truth. He has di&s;&s;ipated the prejudice that had long connected gaiety with vice, and ea&s;ine&s;s of manners with laxity of principles. He re&s;tored virtue to its dignity, and taught innocence not to be a&s;hamed. This is an elevation of literary character, "above all Greek, above all Roman fame." No greater felicity can genius attain than that of having purified intellectual plea&s;ure, &s;eparated mirth from inde|cency, and wit from licentiou&s;ne&s;s; of having taught a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of writers to bring elegance and gaiety to the aid of goodne&s;s; and, to u&s;e expre&s;&s;ions yet more aweful, "of having turned many to righteou&s;ne&s;s." As a delineator of life and manners, he mu&s;t be allowed to &s;tand perhaps the fir&s;t of the fir&s;t rank. His humour, which, as Steele ob&s;erves, is pe|culiar to him&s;elf, is &s;o happily diffu&s;ed, as to give the grace of novelty to dome&s;tic &s;cenes and daily occurrences. He never "out&s;teps the mo|de&s;ty of nature," nor rai&s;es merriment or wonder by the violation of truth. His figures neither divert by di&s;tortion, nor amaze by aggrava|tion. He copies life with &s;o much fidelity, that he can be hardly &s;aid to invent; yet his exhibitions have an air &s;o much original, that it is difficult to &s;uppo&s;e them not merely the product of imagination. As a teacher of wi&s;dom he may be confidently followed. His religion has nothing in it enthu&s;ia&s;tic or &s;uper&s;titious; he appears neither weakly credulous nor wantonly &s;ceptical; his morality is neither dangerou&s;ly lax nor impracticably rigid. All the enchantment of fancy and all the
<PB N="38" REF="50">
cogency of argument are employed to recommend to the reader his real intere&s;t, the care of plea&s;ing the Author of his being. Truth is &s;hown &s;ometimes as the phantom of a vi&s;ion, &s;ometimes appears half-veiled in an allegory; &s;ometimes attracts regard in the robes of fancy, and &s;ome|times &s;teps forth in the confidence of rea&s;on. She wears a thou&s;and dre&s;&s;es, and in all is plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Doctor, however, has related the following anecdote, which every admirer of Addi&s;on, every man of feeling, mu&s;t be reluctant to be|lieve. "Steele (&s;ays the Doctor), who&s;e imprudence of genero&s;ity, or vanity of profu&s;ion, kept him always incurably nece&s;&s;itous, upon &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing exigence, in an evil hour, borrowed an hundred pounds of his friend, probably without much purpo&s;e of repayment; but Addi&s;on, who &s;eems to have had other notions of an hundred pounds, grew impa|tient of delay, and reclaimed his loan by an execution. Steele felt, with great &s;en&s;ibility, the obduracy of his creditor; but with emotions of &s;orrow rather than of anger." It is much to be wi&s;hed, &s;ays Dr. Kippis, that Dr. John&s;on had produced his authority for this narration. It is very po&s;&s;ible, that it may be only a &s;tory the Doctor had &s;omewhere heard in conver&s;ation, and which is entirely groundle&s;s: "and this I am rather inclined to believe, as I have been a&s;&s;ured, by one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable characters in the kingdom, that the fact hath no foundation in truth." Mr. Potter, in a late publication, hath informed us, that he is told by the be&s;t authority, that the &s;tory is an ab&s;olute fal&s;ehood.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyers, in "An hi&s;torical E&s;&s;ay on Mr. Addi&s;on," printed, but not publi&s;hed, has mentioned &s;ome facts concerning him, with which we were not before acquainted. The&s;e are, That he was laid out for dead as &s;oon as he was born: that, when he addre&s;&s;ed his ver&s;es on the Engli&s;h poets to Henry Sacheverell, he courted that gentleman's &s;i&s;ter: that, whenever Jacob Ton&s;on came to him for the Spectator, Bayle's French Hi&s;torical and Critical Dictionary lay always open before him: that, upon his return to England, after his travels, he di&s;charged &s;ome old debts he had contracted at Oxford, with the genero&s;ity of good intere&s;t: that he was put into plentiful circum&s;tances by the death of a brother in the Ea&s;t Indies: that, having received encouragement from a married lady, of whom he had been formerly enamoured, he had the integrity to re&s;i&s;t the temptation: that he refu&s;ed a gratification of a three hundred pounds bank-note, and afterwards of a diamond-ring of the &s;ame value, from a Major Dunbar, whom he had endeavoured to &s;erve in Ireland by his intere&s;t with Lord Sunderland: and that his daughter by Lady Warwick is &s;till alive and unmarried, re&s;iding at Bilton near Rugby, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an income of near twelve hundred a year.</P>
<P>The following letter, which probably relates to the ca&s;e of Major
<PB N="39" REF="51">
Dunbar, reflects great honour on Mr. Addi&s;on's integrity. "<HI>June</HI> 26, 1715. SIR, I find there is a very &s;trong oppo&s;ition formed again&s;t you; but I &s;hall wait on my lord lieutenant this morning, and lay your ca&s;e before him as advantageou&s;ly as I can, if he is not engaged in other company. I am afraid what you &s;ay of his grace does not portend you any good. And now, Sir, believe me, when I a&s;&s;ure you I never did, nor ever will, on any pretence what&s;oever, take more than the &s;tated and cu&s;tomary fees of my office. I might keep the contrary practice concealed from the world, were I capable of it, but I could not from my&s;elf; and I hope I &s;hall always fear the reproaches of my own heart more than tho&s;e of all mankind. In the mean time, if I can &s;erve a gen|tleman of merit, and &s;uch a character as you bear in the world, the &s;a|tisfaction I meet with on &s;uch an occa&s;ion is always a &s;ufficient, and the only reward to, Sir, your mo&s;t obedient, humble &s;ervant, J. ADDISON." &mdash;The anecdote which follows was told by the late Dr. Birch. Addi&s;on and Mr. Temple Stanyan were very intimate. In the familiar conver&s;a|tions which pa&s;&s;ed between them, they were accu&s;tomed freely to di&s;pute each other's opinions. Upon &s;ome occa&s;ion, Mr. Addi&s;on lent Stanyan five hundred pounds. After this, Mr. Stanyan behaved with a timid re|&s;erve, deference, and re&s;pect; not conver&s;ing with the &s;ame freedom as formerly, or canva&s;&s;ing his friend's &s;entiments. This gave great unea&s;i|ne&s;s to Mr. Addi&s;on. One day they happened to fall upon a &s;ubject, on which Mr. Stanyan had always been u&s;ed &s;trenuou&s;ly to oppo&s;e his opinion. But, even upon this occa&s;ion, he gave way to what his friend advanced, without interpo&s;ing his own view of the matter. This hurt Mr. Addi&s;on &s;o much, that he &s;aid to Mr. Stanyan, "Either contradict me, or pay me the money."</P>
<P>In Tickell's edition of Mr. Addi&s;on's works there are &s;everal pieces hitherto unmentioned, viz. The Di&s;&s;ertation on Medals; which, though not publi&s;hed till after his death, yet he had collected the materials, and began to put them in order, at Vienna, in 1702. A pamphlet, intitled, The pre&s;ent State of the War, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of an Augmentation, con&s;idered. The late Trial and Conviction of Count Tariff.

He accompanied Trajan in mo&s;t of his expeditions, and particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the &s;econd war again&s;t the Daci; and having before been quae&s;tor, as well as tribune of the people, he was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively praetor, governor of Pannonia, and con&s;ul. After the &s;iege of Atra in Arabia was rai&s;ed, Trajan, who had already given him the government of Syria, left him the command of the army: and at length, when he found death ap|proaching, it is &s;aid adopted him. Adrian, who was then in Antio|chia, as &s;oon as he received the news thereof, and of Trajan's death, declared him&s;elf emperor, on the 11th of Augu&s;t, 117. No &s;ooner had he arrived at the imperial dignity, than he made peace with the Per|&s;ians, to whom he yielded up great part of the conque&s;ts of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors; and from genero&s;ity, or policy, he remitted the debts of the Ro|man people, which, according to the calculation of tho&s;e who have re|duced them to modern money, amounted to 22,500,000 golden crowns; and he burnt all the bonds and obligations relating to tho&s;e debts, that the people might be under no apprehen&s;ion of being called to an account for them afterwards. There are medals in commemoration of this fact, in which he is repre&s;ented holding a flambeau in his hand; to &s;et fire to all tho&s;e bonds which he had made void. He went to vi&s;it all the pro|vinces; and did not return to Rome till the year 118, when the &s;enate decreed him a triumph, and honoured him with the title of Father of his Country; but he refu&s;ed both, and de&s;ired that Trajan's image might triumph. No prince travelled more than Adrian; there being hardly one province in the empire which he did not vi&s;it. In 120 he went into Gaul; from thence he went to Britain, in order to &s;ubdue the Ca|ledonians, who were making continual inroads into the provinces. Upon his arrival they retired towards the north: he advanced however as far as York, where he was diverted from his intended conque&s;t by the de|&s;cription &s;ome old &s;oldiers he found there, who had &s;erved under Agri|cola, gave him of the country. In hopes, therefore, of keeping them quiet by enlarging their bounds, he delivered up to the Caledonians all the lands lying between the two Friths and the Tyne; and at the &s;ame time, to &s;ecure the Roman province from their future incur&s;ions, built the famous wall which &s;till bears his name. Having thus &s;ettled mat|ters in Britain, he returned to Rome, where he was honoured with the title of Re&s;torer of Britain, as appears by &s;ome medals. He &s;oon after went into Spain, to Mauritania, and at length into the Ea&s;t, where he
<PB N="41" REF="53">
quieted the commotions rai&s;ed by the Parthians. After having vi&s;ited all the provinces of A&s;ia, he returned to Athens in 125, where he pa&s;&s;ed the winter, and was initiated in the my&s;teries of Eleu&s;inian Ceres. He went from thence to Sicily, chiefly to view mount Aetna, contemplate its phenomena, and enjoy the beautiful and exten&s;ive pro&s;pect afforded from its top. He returned to Rome the beginning of the year 129; and, according to &s;ome, went again the &s;ame year to Africa; and, after his return from thence, to the Ea&s;t. He was in Egypt in the year 132, revi&s;ited Syria the year following, returned to Athens in 134, and to Rome in 135. The per&s;ecution again&s;t the Chri&s;tians was very vio|lent under his reign; but it was at length &s;u&s;pended, in con&s;equence of the remon&s;trances of Quadrat bi&s;hop of Athens, and Ari&s;tides, two Chri&s;tian philo&s;ophers, who pre&s;ented the emperor with &s;ome books in favour of the Chri&s;tian religion. He conquered the Jews; and, by way of in&s;ult, erected a temple to Jupiter on Calvary, and placed a &s;tatue of Adonis in the manger of Bethlehem; he cau&s;ed al&s;o the images of &s;wine to be engraven on the gates of Jeru&s;alem. At la&s;t he was &s;eized with a drop&s;y, which tormented him to &s;uch a degree, that he became almo&s;t ra|ving mad. A great number of phy&s;icians were &s;ent for, and to the multitude of them he a&s;cribed his death. He died at Baiae in the 63d year of his age, having reigned 21 years. The Latin ver&s;es he addre&s;&s;ed to his &s;oul have been much critici&s;ed and variou&s;ly interpreted. There are &s;ome fragments of his Latin poems extant, and there are Greek ver&s;es of his in the Anthology. He al&s;o wrote the hi&s;tory of his own life: to which, however, he did not choo&s;e to put his name; but that of Phle|gon, one of his freed-men, a very learned per&s;on, was prefixed to it. He had great wit, and an exten&s;ive memory. He under&s;tood the &s;ci|ences perfectly well; but was very jealous of others who excelled in them. He was al&s;o cruel, envious, and la&s;civious. Antoninus, his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, obtained his apotheo&s;is; and prevented the re&s;ci&s;&s;ion of his acts, which the &s;enate once intended.</P>

<HEAD>ADRIAN IV. (POPE),</HEAD>
<P>THE only Engli&s;hman who ever had the honour of &s;itting in the papal chair. His name was Nicholas Breke&s;pere; and he was born at Langley, near St. Alban's, in Hertford&s;hire. His father having left his family, and taken the habit of the mona&s;tery of St. Alban's, Nicholas was obliged to &s;ubmit to the lowe&s;t offices in that hou&s;e for daily &s;up|port. After &s;ome time, he de&s;ired to take the habit in that mona&s;tery, but was rejected by the Abbot Richard. Upon this he re&s;olved to try his fortune in another country, and accordingly went to Paris; where, though in very poor circum&s;tances, he applied him&s;elf to his &s;tudies with
<PB N="42" REF="54">
great a&s;&s;iduity, and made a wonderful proficiency. But having &s;till a &s;trong inclination to a religious life, he left Paris, and removed to Pro|vence, where he became a regular clerk in the mona&s;tery of St. Rufus. He was not immediately allowed to take the habit; but pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time, by way of trial, in recommending him&s;elf to the monks by a &s;trict attention to all their commands. This behaviour, together with the beauty of his per&s;on, and prudent conver&s;ation, rendered him &s;o accep|table to tho&s;e religious, that after &s;ome time they intreated him to take the habit of the canonical order. Here he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o much by his learning and &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the mona&s;tic di&s;cipline, that, upon the death of the abbot, he was cho&s;en &s;uperior of that hou&s;e; and we are told that he rebuilt that convent. Pope Eugenius III. being appri&s;ed of the great merit of Nicholas, and thinking he might be &s;er|viceable to the church in a higher &s;tation, created him cardinal-bi&s;hop of Alba in 1146. In 1148, his holine&s;s &s;ent him legate to Denmark and Norway; where, by his fervent preaching and diligent in&s;tructions, he converted tho&s;e barbarous nations to the Chri&s;tian faith; and erected Up&s;al into an archiepi&s;copal &s;ee. When he returned to Rome, he was received by the pope and cardinals with great marks of honour: and Pope Ana&s;ta&s;ius, who &s;ucceeded Eugenius, happening to die at this time, Nicholas was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to the holy &s;ee, in November 1154, and he took the name of <HI>Adrian.</HI> When the news of his promo|tion reached England, King Henry II. &s;ent Robert, Abbot of St. Alban's, and three bi&s;hops, to Rome, to congratulate him on his elec|tion; upon which occa&s;ion Adrian granted very con&s;iderable privileges to the mona&s;tery of St. Alban's, particularly an exemption from all epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, excepting to the &s;ee of Rome. Adrian, in the beginning of his pontificate, boldly with&s;tood the attempts of the Roman people to recover their ancient liberty under the con&s;uls, and obliged tho&s;e magi&s;trates to abdicate their authority, and leave the government of the city to the pope. In 1155, he drove the heretic Arnaud of Bre&s;&s;e, and his followers, out of Rome. The &s;ame year he excommu|nicated William, king of Sicily, who ravaged the territories of the church, and ab&s;olved that prince's &s;ubjects from their allegiance. About the &s;ame time, Frederic king of the Romans having entered Italy with a powerful army, Adrian met him near Sutrium, and concluded a peace with him. At this interview, Frederic con&s;ented to hold the pope's &s;tirrup whil&s;t he mounted on hor&s;eback. After which, his holine&s;s con|ducted that prince to Rome, and in St. Peter's church placed the impe|rial crown on his head, to the great mortification of the Roman people, who a&s;&s;embled in a tumultuous manner, and killed &s;everal of the Impe|riali&s;ts.

The next year a reconciliation was brought about between the pope and the Sicilian king, that prince taking an oath to do nothing farther to the prejudice of the church, and Adrian granting him the title of <HI>King of the Two Sicilies.</HI> He built and fortified &s;everal ca&s;tles, and left the papal dominions in a more flouri&s;hing condition than he found them. But notwith&s;tanding all his &s;ucce&s;s, he was extremely &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;quietudes attending &s;o high a &s;tation; and declared to his countryman, John of Sali&s;bury, that all the former hard&s;hips of his life were mere amu&s;ement to the misfortunes of the popedom: that he looked upon St. Peter's chair to be the mo&s;t unea&s;y &s;eat in the world; and that his crown &s;eemed to be clapped burning on his head. He died September 1, 1159, in the fourth year and tenth month of his pon|tificate; and was buried in St. Peter's church, near the tomb of his predece&s;&s;or Eugenius, There are extant &s;everal letters, and &s;ome ho|milies, written by Pope Adrian.</P>

<HEAD>AELFRID, OR ALFRED (THE GREAT),</HEAD>
<P>BY &s;ome called Elfred, and by others Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red, was the younge&s;t &s;on of Aethelwolf, king of the We&s;t Saxons. He was born anno 849. His father, a wi&s;e and religious prince, believing that he &s;aw in him a brighter and a more promi&s;ing genius than in his other children, &s;ent him, when in his fifth year, to Rome, where he was adopted by Pope Leo IV. and anointed by him. This &s;ome conceive to have been a regal unction, others think he was only confirmed. His father, in the decline of life, paying a vi&s;it to the Holy See, took this favourite &s;on with him, which afforded him an opportunity to make great improvement.</P>
<P>On his return to England, his parents were as fond of him as ever; but this tenderne&s;s was not of &s;ervice to Aelfrid, &s;ince it e&s;tranged him from learning, and cau&s;ed him to indulge idlene&s;s and a pur&s;uit of youth|ful plea&s;ures. On his father's death, he had an appanage left him by will; but his brothers, who &s;ucceeded to the throne, deluded him with fair promi&s;es, and limited his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. However, his grave and philo&s;ophic turn of mind induced him to think of recovering the time he had lo&s;t in his nonage, which made him the more readily admit the&s;e excu&s;es, and he would have been well contented with his books and ea&s;e. But he was not long permitted to enjoy even the&s;e &s;mall comforts. For the Danes invading the kingdom, he was obligated to quit a contem|plative life for an active one. He &s;erved his brothers, both with his advice and per&s;on, till their deaths, when he became king in his own right A. D. 871, at the age of twenty-two. He a&s;&s;umed this dignity with much reluctance, not only from his love of a retired life, but be|cau&s;e he was well convinced that a crown, though adorned with jewels, was lined with cares, and often proved a heavy burthen to the wearer.
<PB N="46" REF="59">
He had &s;carcely buried his brothers, ere he was obliged to fight for that crown he had &s;o unwillingly accepted. He engaged the Dani&s;h army at Wilton, and had the advantage on the fir&s;t on&s;et; but the Danes per|ceiving his weakne&s;s, rallied in the pur&s;uit, and drove him out of the field. This cannot be wondered at&punc; when we con&s;ider that, exclu&s;ive of their inferiority in numbers, the Saxons had fought eight or nine battles that year, and mu&s;t have been harra&s;&s;ed exce&s;&s;ively. Soon after this a treaty was concluded, which the Danes paid little attention to, as they continued roaming about the country, and plundering wherever they came. They at length de&s;troyed the kingdom of Mercia, and forced its monarch to leave his dominions, and the i&s;land. The next year they acted in a manner that gave Aelfrid to under&s;tand he had nothing to tru&s;t to but arms: for this rea&s;on he fitted out a fleet to guard the coa&s;ts, and keep the&s;e rovers from landing. This de&s;ign produced, in &s;ome degree, the de&s;ired effect; for a &s;quadron of Dani&s;h &s;hips coming on the coa&s;t, one was taken. But a large army of Danes, commanded by &s;everal of their kings, marched as far as Grant Bridge, and quartered there the be&s;t part of the year. The next &s;ummer they advanced to Werham, where king Aelfrid met them with all the forces he could rai&s;e; but finding him&s;elf too weak to encounter them, concluded a peace; which, if &s;ome hi&s;to|rians are to be credited, was not done without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of money. However, the peace was made, and the Danes &s;wore never to invade his dominions. This oath, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, they broke in a very few months; and the year following, 876, committed fre&s;h and great ho&s;tilities, which cau&s;ed the king to march again&s;t them with all the forces he could get together. He found them at Exeter, where he kept them be&s;ieged for &s;ome time. In the mean while, his fleet &s;ucce&s;sfully engaged the enemy at &s;ea; for notwith&s;tanding theirs con&s;i&s;ted of an hundred and twenty &s;ail, many were &s;unk, and the re&s;t di&s;per&s;ed, which in attempting to gain &s;ome of the Engli&s;h ports, were driven by a &s;torm on the coa&s;ts, and all peri&s;hed The barbarians were &s;o di&s;couraged at this, that they made peace once more, and gave ho&s;tages. But in 877, having gained fre&s;h &s;upplies, they revi&s;ited Wilt&s;hire in &s;uch numbers, that the Saxons could not be prevailed on to make head again&s;t them. Many, to avoid them, fled from the kingdom; others &s;ubmitted them|&s;elves; and the re&s;t, &s;uffering their fear to &s;uper&s;ede their duty, fled to the mo&s;t likely place of &s;ecurity. Aelfrid no longer conceiving him&s;elf a king, laid a&s;ide all &s;igns of royalty; and to &s;ecure his per&s;on, took &s;helter in the hou&s;e of a pea&s;ant who kept his cattle. While he con|tinued in this retreat, a trifling adventure occurred which is noticed by &s;everal hi&s;torians. The good woman of the hou&s;e having made &s;ome cakes, put them before the fire to toa&s;t, and &s;eeing Aelfrid &s;itting by, trimming
<PB N="47" REF="60">
his bow and arrows, &s;he made no doubt but he would take care of them; but he, it &s;eems, intent on what he was about, let the cakes burn, which &s;o enraged the woman, that &s;he &s;colded him &s;everely, telling him that he would be glad to eat them, and therefore ought to have looked after them. The king, however, did not long remain in this deplorable &s;ituation; for ob&s;erving that a part of Somer&s;et&s;hire was &s;o inclo&s;ed by the waters of the Perrot and the Thone, as to form a mora&s;s, which it was almo&s;t impracticable to force, he built a fort in the center, where there were about two acres of firm ground, for the &s;ecurity of him|&s;elf, his family, and a few faithful &s;ervants who repaired thither to him. This place he named Aethelingey, or rather Aethelinga-igge, that is, the <HI>I&s;le of Nobles,</HI> now called Athelney. He continued there &s;ome months, frequently &s;allying out upon the Danes with incredible &s;ecre&s;y and &s;ucce&s;s. When he had &s;pent almo&s;t a year in this manner, he learnt that &s;ome of his &s;ubjects had routed a great army of Danes, killed their chiefs or kings, and taken their magical &s;tandard. He then i&s;&s;ued out letters to acquaint them with the place where he was, and to invite the nobility to come and con&s;ult with him. This they did, and were much, plea&s;ed when the king propo&s;ed taking the field with an army, and not to act any longer by &s;tealth with the enemy. But before they came to a final re&s;olution, Aelfrid, that his &s;ubjects might not hazard too much, expo&s;ed his own per&s;on in an extraordinary manner:&mdash;He went in the habit of a harper into the enemy's camp, and was admitted every where about it without &s;u&s;picion; he even had the honour to play before their princes. Having furni&s;hed him&s;elf with an exact knowledge of their &s;ituation, he returned with great &s;ecre&s;y to his friends, whom he directed to go to their &s;everal homes, and each of them to draw together as great a force as he po&s;&s;ibly could; with which, on a day prefixed, he was to come to the great wood, now called Selwood, in Wilt&s;hire. This they punctually performed; and the Danes were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed when they heard that king Aelfrid, whom they looked upon as a fugitive, was preparing to attack them with a royal army. The king took advantage of their confu&s;ion, fell upon, and totally defeated them at Aethendune, now called Eddington. Tho&s;e who e&s;caped took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a ruined ca&s;tle in the neighbourhood, which they fortified, but they were &s;oon be&s;ieged by the victorious Saxons. After a long and clo&s;e &s;iege, the Danes were obliged to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Aelfrid behaved to them like a merciful prince, by giving up the kingdom of the Ea&s;t Angles to &s;uch as would embrace the Chri&s;tian religion, on condition that they would oblige the re&s;t of their countrymen to quit the i&s;land, and prevent, as far as was in their power, the landing of any more foreigners. For the performance of the&s;e articles he took ho&s;tages; and when, in pur|&s;uance
<PB N="48" REF="61">
of the treaty Guthrum, the Dani&s;h captain or king, came with thirty of his chief officers to Aelfrid, who then lay encamped at Aalre, now Auler, a &s;mall village in Somer&s;et&s;hire, to be baptized, the king an&s;wered for him at the fort, gave him the name of Aethel&s;tan, and adopted him for his &s;on. He then entertained him and his friends twelve days at his hou&s;e at Wedmore, or Wetmore, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with noble pre&s;ents. By the Danes turning Chri&s;tians, the Saxons gained this great advantage, that they now kept their oaths, and for the pre&s;ent remained very quiet. Some time after this, a fre&s;h &s;et of Danes came up the river Thames, and wintered at Fulham; but finding Aelfrid well prepared to receive them, thought proper to go off and try their fortunes in France. The Saxon fleet being very &s;ucce&s;sful at &s;ea, the king &s;pared neither pains nor expence to keep it in good order. In 884 the Danes landed in Kent, and laid &s;iege to Roche&s;ter; but it was &s;o bravely defended by the inhabitants, that the king came in time to relieve them, forced the enemy to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and return once more to France. Soon after, his fleet had the good fortune to beat a very con|&s;iderable one of the Danes, de&s;troyed thirteen &s;hips, and according to the king's orders, gave no quarter to any of the men on board. In a &s;hort time after this the Saxons them&s;elves were defeated; but this was an advantage to them, as it cau&s;ed them to be more vigilant for the fu|ture. Aelfrid having &s;ome lei&s;ure time now, re&s;olved to repair, refor|tify, and repeople the city of London, which he had lately recovered from the Danes, and meant to keep as a frontier. Accordingly he re|edified it, placed a garri&s;on in it, and e&s;tabli&s;hed Aethered as the gover|nor. He created him Earl of Mercia, and gave him his daughter Aethel|fleda in marriage. This earl was a gallant officer and great &s;tate&s;man; for which rea&s;on the Saxons that had &s;ubmitted to the Danes, and the Danes that had began to learn the Saxon manners, were obedient to him, and &s;ettled in London, and the other places under his juri&s;diction. After a peace of &s;ome years, Aelfrid was again called into the field; for the Danes, who had been &s;everely beaten in the We&s;t of France, came with a fleet of two hundred and &s;ixty &s;ail on the Ea&s;t coa&s;t of Kent, and landing, fixed them&s;elves at Appletree. Shortly after another fleet came up the Thames, con&s;i&s;ting of eighty ve&s;&s;els; they landed the &s;oldiers, and built a fort at Middleton. Aelfrid, on finding him&s;elf in this &s;itua|tion, drew together a con&s;iderable army; but before he marched again&s;t the enemy, he obliged the Danes that were &s;ettled in Northumberland and E&s;&s;ex, to give ho&s;tages for their good behaviour. He then moved towards the invaders, and very prudently cho&s;e a camp between their armies, by which means he prevented their junction. A great body of them moved into E&s;&s;ex, and from thence, cro&s;&s;ing the river, came into
<PB N="49" REF="62">
Surrey. The king's forces met and defeated them at Farnham. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e confu&s;ions, the Danes who were &s;ettled in Northumber|land broke their faith; and, notwith&s;tanding the ho&s;tages they had given, equipped two fleets, the one of a hundred, and the other of forty ve&s;&s;els. After plundering the northern and &s;outhern coa&s;ts, they &s;ailed round, came to Exeter, and be&s;ieged it. As &s;oon as the king heard of their perfidious behaviour, he re&s;olved to march immediately to Exeter, leaving behind him a great body of Wel&s;h. The Danes had got po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the place before he arrived; however he &s;hut them up in it, and notwith&s;tanding they made many de&s;perate &s;allies, kept them effectually blocked up. The body of Wel&s;h he had left behind him, thinking it neither their intere&s;t nor duty to be idle, marched to London and joined the citizens. They had not been long in London, before news came that Hae&s;ten, one of the Dani&s;h kings, with mo&s;t of his forces, was marched out to forage, and had left his family and riches at Beamfleet, where he had built a fort. They re&s;olved to attack it in his ab&s;ence, and &s;uc|ceeded in their enterpri&s;e; not only taking the place, with his wife and children, but al&s;o all the riches they had collected by many years rapine. Hae&s;ten, when he received the news, was &s;o much grieved, that he &s;ent to Aelfrid, who was then before Exeter, to beg a peace, which the good king granted upon very rea&s;onable terms; and which he, like a true Dane, broke as &s;oon as it was concluded. He plundered the di&s;trict belonging to Earl Aethered, though he had &s;tood godfather to one of this prince's &s;ons; and, after all, joining the other Dani&s;h army, march|ed with them to Shobury in E&s;&s;ex, where they built another ca&s;tle. Then pa&s;&s;ing the Thames with tho&s;e who joined them from Northumber|land, and the territories of the Ea&s;t Angles, they marched on to the Severn, laying wa&s;te all in their way. On the banks of this river, viz. at the Buttington, in Montgomery&s;hire, Aelfrid's generals gave them a check; and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river hindered them from pa&s;&s;ing for many weeks. In the mean time the king had kept &s;uch a clo&s;e &s;iege at Exeter, and drove the people to &s;uch extremities, that having eaten their hor&s;es, they were ready to devour one another. Rendered de&s;pe|rate by de&s;pair, they &s;allied on the king's forces, but were beaten, though with great lo&s;s on the king's &s;ide. The remains of this body of the Danes fled to their &s;hips, and to their fort they had built in E&s;&s;ex. Be|fore the king had time to recruit, another Dani&s;h leader, who&s;e name was Laf, came with a great army out of Northumberland, and de&s;troyed all before them, marching on to the city of Werheal, or Che&s;ter. There they remained the re&s;t of that year; the next they invaded North Wales, which they plundered and de&s;troyed; and when there was nothing more to be taken, they divided, one party returning into Northumberland,
<PB N="50" REF="63">
and the other into the territories of the Ea&s;t Angles; whence proceeding into E&s;&s;ex, they &s;eized upon a &s;mall i&s;land, called Mere&s;ig. They parted &s;oon after this, &s;ome &s;ailing up the river Thames, and others up to Lee Road; where drawing up their &s;hips, they built a fort twenty miles from London, which proved a great curb upon the citizens. The Londoners, unable to bear this re&s;traint with any patience, went in a large body, and attacked the fort; but were repul&s;ed with con&s;iderable lo&s;s: which obliged the king, about harve&s;t-time, to encamp in the neighbourhood of that city, in order to cover the reapers from the incur&s;ions of the Danes. Aelfrid one day riding by the river Lee, formed an opinion, that by cutting certain trenches the Dani&s;h &s;hips might be laid quite dry. This he attempted, and &s;ucceeded in &s;o well, that the Danes abandoned their fort, and marched away to the banks of the Severn; where having built a fortre&s;s at a place called Quatbrig, they wintered there. Such of the Dani&s;h &s;hips as could be got off, the Londoners carried in tri|umph into their own road, and de&s;troyed the re&s;t. During three years, the Engli&s;h were not only vexed with the continual irruptions of the&s;e barbarous people, but &s;uffered greatly by a dreadful plague, which af|fected both people and cattle. The Danes, ever re&s;tle&s;s, began again to invade the territories of the We&s;t Saxons both by land and &s;ea; having acquired the art of building long and large &s;hips, they were in a manner ma&s;ters of that element, and of cour&s;e depopulated all the coa&s;t. Aelfrid having long ruminated on the be&s;t method to prevent tho&s;e evils, con|trived larger and better &s;hips than the Danes, and &s;ent them on the coa&s;ts of the I&s;le of Wight, and of Devon&s;hire, which were at that time infe&s;ted by pirates. Aelfrid's &s;quadron &s;ucceeded as well as could be ex|pected, driving two of their &s;hips on &s;hore, &s;inking three, and &s;uffer|ing only one to e&s;cape. This was not executed without great lo&s;s on the king's &s;ide, particularly among the officers. Such of the Danes as landed when their &s;hips ran on &s;hore, were taken pri&s;oners, and brought to the king at Winche&s;ter; where he pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence upon them, to be hanged, as pirates and murderers. In the &s;ub&s;equent part of the king's life, viz. in the years 898 and 899, nothing remarkable happened, except that the king employed the peace and lei&s;ure he then enjoyed, in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing effectually that government which he had been at &s;uch pains to frame, not more for the &s;ecurity of him&s;elf and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, than for the benefit of his &s;ubjects in general.</P>
<P>Before the reign of Aelfrid, there were many kings who took the title, but none who could with propriety be called Monarch of the Engli&s;h nation. For though there always remained, after the time of Egbert, a prince who held a kind of pre-eminence over the re&s;t, yet he had not the direct dominion over his &s;ubjects; this Aelfrid had, in the latter part
<PB N="51" REF="64">
of his reign; to him all parts of England, not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Danes, &s;ubmitted, and a great part of Wales: this great power was attained more by his wi&s;dom and mildne&s;s, than his &s;word, or ambition of ruling. We have already mentioned the laws he made; and though there are few remaining, which we can a&s;certain to be his, yet we are well informed, that to his regulations we owe many advantages, which render our con&s;titution dear to us: for in&s;tance, trials by juries. His in|&s;titutions were what is called the Common Law; &s;o &s;tyled, &s;ays a great author, either on account of its being the common law of all the Saxons, without re&s;pect to the kingdoms where they lived, or becau&s;e it was common both to the Saxons and Danes. It is, indeed, a di&s;puted point, whether he was the fir&s;t who divided the kingdom into &s;hires; but that he &s;ettled tho&s;e boundaries and le&s;&s;er di&s;tinctions that remain to this day, admits of no doubt. On this &s;ubject he formed a book, which contained a &s;urvey of the kingdom, and of which the Doome&s;day Book is in &s;ome re&s;pect a &s;econd edition. He al&s;o made u&s;e of tho&s;e divi&s;ions for the proper di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice &s;o happily, that though he found the kingdom in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, and the people in it &s;o indigent and given to rapine, that it was equally difficult to acquire wealth, or to keep it when acquired. Yet by his prudent government he &s;o effectually cured the covetous &s;pirit which induces one man to take from another, that authors tell us, money and jewels might be left on the public roads, with the greate&s;t &s;afety. In the direction of &s;tate affairs he followed the cu&s;toms of his ance&s;tors, the kings of the We&s;t Saxons. He made u&s;e of the great council of the kingdom, con&s;i&s;ting of bi&s;hops, earls, the king's aldermen, and his chief thanes, or barons, whom in the fir&s;t part of his reign he convoked, as occa&s;ion required; but when things were better &s;ettled, he made a law, that twice in the year an a&s;&s;embly, or parliament, &s;hould be held at London, to provide for the well-governing of the commonwealth. As to extraordinary affairs, and &s;uch emergencies as would not admit of calling great councils, the king then acted by the advice of his bi&s;hops, earls, and officers of the army who happened to be near his per&s;on. With re&s;pect to military concerns, there has been &s;o much &s;aid already, that it renders it almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to add much here. Let it however be ob&s;erved, that though this nation could never boa&s;t of a greater &s;oldier, he was neither cruel, blood-thir&s;ty, or ambi|tious; he never made war willingly with any, or refu&s;ed to grant peace when it was de&s;ired: he fought fifty-&s;ix &s;et battles by &s;ea and land, eight of which happened in one year. By degrees he rendered his troops invincible, by a ju&s;t and regular di&s;cipline; and appointed &s;uch methods of rai&s;ing, recruiting, and di&s;tributing them in winter quarters, that his &s;ubjects and militia were &s;ynonymous terms; every man who could bear
<PB N="52" REF="65">
arms was a &s;oldier, and no one &s;erved out of his turn. His coa&s;ts he &s;ecured by guard&s;hips; his frontiers were covered with ca&s;tles, well for|tified, which, before his time, the Saxons had never rai&s;ed. Added to all this, his in&s;tructions and example rai&s;ed numbers of abl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> officers, who&s;e abilities the king con&s;tantly cheri&s;hed by proportionable rewards. In other affairs Aelfrid was equally great and indu&s;trious, as appears by his repairing the cities throughout his dominions which were demoli&s;hed by the Danes, erecting new ones, and adorning and embelli&s;hing &s;uch as were in a mean and low condition. We may judge of the great things he per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ormed in this way, &s;ince it is affirmed that one &s;ixth part of his clear revenu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s was applied to the payment of his workmen's wages. This prince was extremely remarkable for his piety with re&s;pect to reli|gious foundations, and excelled mo&s;t of his predece&s;&s;ors in this point: for be&s;ides re-edifying and re&s;toring almo&s;t every mona&s;tery in his do|minions, which the prevailing poverty of the times, or the &s;acrilegious fury of the Danes, had brought to ruin, he built many, and improved more; be&s;ides other acts of munificence towards the church. As to his founding the univer&s;ity of Oxford, it is a matter that has been &s;o warmly di&s;puted, that we &s;hall only &s;ay what is certainly due to him on that head: he re&s;tored and &s;ettled it, endowed it with revenues, and placed there the mo&s;t celebrated profe&s;&s;ors of &s;everal &s;ciences. A king, who was &s;o careful of his people, might well allow &s;omething to his royal magnificence, e&s;pecially as he was ever mindful of his &s;ubjects' honour, and attentive to their ea&s;e. He repaired all the royal palaces, which the confu&s;ion of the times before his reign had brought to decay; adorned the hou&s;es of plea&s;ure in the country, and built many from the ground, where the &s;ituation was tempting. He had always a very nu|merous court, and above all things took great plea&s;ure in &s;eeing his no|bility about him. To do this without prejudice to the public, he fell upon a method which ought not to be forgotten; he framed three dif|ferent hou&s;holds, each under a &s;eparate lord chamberlain: the&s;e waited in their turns a month every quarter; &s;o that in the year each of the king's menial &s;ervants was four months at court, and eight at home. In all other re&s;pects he was extremely careful to keep up both the dignity and lu&s;tre of his court; but whether he made u&s;e of an imperial crown, enriched with jewels (as &s;ome affirm), is a point which may admit of di&s;pute. To conclude his character as a king, and there is not a brighter in the Engli&s;h, or perhaps any chronicles, we &s;hall take notice of the manner in which he &s;ettled his revenue, and to which he &s;trictly adhered throughout his life: he fir&s;t divided it equally, a&s;&s;igning one part to &s;a|cred, the other to civil u&s;es. The former he divided into four parts; one to be be&s;towed in alms upon the poor in general; another he
<PB N="53" REF="66">
de&s;tined for the &s;upport of religious hou&s;es which he had founded; a third was given to the public &s;chools; and the fourth employed in re|building or relieving mona&s;teries, and other public foundations at home and abroad. The other moiety of his revenue was divided into three parts; one for the &s;upport of his hou&s;hold, another for the payment of his workmen, and a third for the entertainment and relief of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>In his private life he was the mo&s;t worthy, the mo&s;t indu&s;trious, and the mo&s;t amiable man in his dominions; of &s;o equal a temper, that after he had once taken the crown, he never &s;uffered either &s;adne&s;s or unbe|coming gaiety to enter his mind; but appeared always of a calm, yet chearful di&s;po&s;ition; familiar with his friends, and ju&s;t, even to his ene|mies; kind and tender to all: he watched over his time with great care, and gave &s;trong evidences of much learning. With all the&s;e qua|lifications, &s;o many virtues, and &s;o few vices, we need not wonder that he died univer&s;ally lamented by his &s;ubjects. This happened, after a glorious reign of upwards of twenty-eight years, on the 20th of Octo|ber, A. D. 900. This king had to wife Ael&s;with, or Aethelwith, daugh|ter to Earl Aethelred; by whom he had two &s;ons, and three daughters. Edward, the elde&s;t, &s;ucceeded him on the throne; and is by mo&s;t hi&s;tori|ans called Edward the Elder, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the Confe&s;&s;or. His &s;econd &s;on was Aetheward, the younge&s;t of all his children, and bred a &s;cholar. His elde&s;t daughter, Aethelfleda, was a woman of more than feminine &s;pirit, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;hare of her father's virtues, as enabled her to be very u&s;eful to her brother Edward, by giving him good advice. She married Aethered, Earl of Mercia, and, together with him, had the care of her nephew, Aethel&s;tan. Aelfrid's &s;econd daughter was called Aethelgeow, or Aethelgora, and was abbe&s;s of her father's new foundation at Athelney. His younge&s;t daughter, called Aelfreda, married Baldwin, Earl of Flanders. When we con&s;ider the fame of this great king, we need not be &s;urpri&s;ed, that all our hi&s;torians have been particular in tran&s;mitting the memory of his exploits to po&s;|terity, or that many con&s;iderable per&s;ons &s;hould compo&s;e &s;pecial me|moirs of his life. Among&s;t the&s;e, the fir&s;t was A&s;&s;erius Meneven&s;is, who wrote in the king's lifetime, and dedicated his book to Aelfrid him&s;elf. In later times, Sir John Spelman compo&s;ed in Engli&s;h the life of this great prince, which he depo&s;ited in manu&s;cript in the Bodleian library, where it remained a long time, before it was given to the pub|lic. At la&s;t it appeared in a Latin tran&s;lation, by the ingenious Mr. Chri&s;topher Wi&s;e. This only &s;erved to rai&s;e a de&s;ire of &s;eeing Sir John Spelman's life as he left it; which, after much expectation, was gratified by Mr. Thomas Hearne. Be&s;ides the&s;e, is a life, or rather a parallel be|tween the life of Aelfrid and that of Charles I. written by a Mr.

It would be doing this na|tion infinite &s;ervice, if a per&s;on equal to the ta&s;k would, from the&s;e and other helps which might be met with, compo&s;e a new life of Aelfrid, in|&s;erting his laws and other things in their proper places, and illu&s;trating them, as well as whatever pa&s;&s;ages might require it, with copious di&s;&s;er|tations. This would place one of the mo&s;t glorious periods of our hi&s;|tory in a proper light, and give us a very plea&s;ing view of our ancient con&s;titution; which, the better it is under&s;tood, will appear to have been the be&s;t conducted for promoting the glory of the monarch and the good of the &s;ubject, that ever the world &s;aw, or in all probability ever will, unle&s;s &s;ome future Aelfrid ari&s;e, and reform all the errors that time and accidents have brought into our &s;y&s;tem.</P>

<P>THE tragic poet, was born at Athens. Authors differ in regard to the time of his birth, &s;ome placing it in the 65th, others in the 70th Olympiad; but according to Stanley, who relies on the Arundelian mar|bles, he was born in the 63d Olympiad. He was the &s;on of Euphorion, and brother to Cynegirus and Aminias, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the battle of Marathon, and the &s;ea-fight of Salamis, at which engage|ments Ae&s;chylus was likewi&s;e pre&s;ent. In this la&s;t action, according to Diodorus Siculus, Aminias, the younger of the three brothers, com|manded a &s;quadron of &s;hips, and behaved with &s;o much conduct and bravery, that he &s;unk the admiral of the Per&s;ian fleet, and &s;ignalized him&s;elf above all the Athenians. To this brother our poet was, upon a particular occa&s;ion, obliged for &s;aving his life: Aelian relates, that
<PB N="57" REF="70">
Ae&s;chylus being charged by the Athenians with certain bla&s;phemous ex|pre&s;&s;ions in &s;ome of his pieces, was accu&s;ed of impiety, and condemned to be &s;toned to death: they were ju&s;t going to put the &s;entence into execution, when Aminias, with a happy pre&s;ence of mind, throwing a&s;ide his cloak, &s;hewed his arm without a hand, which he had lo&s;t at the battle of Salamis in defence of his country. This &s;ight made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the judges, that, touched with the remembrance of his va|lour, and with the friend&s;hip he &s;howed for his brother, they pardoned Ae&s;chylus. Our poet, however, re&s;ented the indignity of this pro&s;ecu|tion, and re&s;olved to leave a place where his life had been in danger. He became more determined in this re&s;olution when he found his pieces le&s;s plea&s;ing to the Athenians than tho&s;e of Sophocles, though a much younger writer. Some affirm, that Ae&s;chylus never &s;at down to compo&s;e but when he had drank liberally. He wrote a great number of trage|dies, of which there are but &s;even remaining: and notwith&s;tanding the &s;harp cen&s;ures of &s;ome critics, he mu&s;t be allowed to have been the fa|ther of the tragic art. In the time of The&s;pis, there was no public thea|tre to act upon; the &s;trollers driving about from place to place in a cart. Ae&s;chylus furni&s;hed his actors with ma&s;ks, and dre&s;&s;ed them &s;uitably to their characters. He likewi&s;e introduced the bu&s;kin, to make them more like heroes.&mdash;The ancients gave Ae&s;chylus al&s;o the prai&s;e of having been the fir&s;t who removed murders and &s;hocking &s;ights from the eyes of the &s;pectators. He is &s;aid likewi&s;e to have le&s;&s;ened the number of the chorus. M. Le Fevre has ob&s;erved, that Ae&s;chylus never repre&s;ented women in love in his tragedies; which, he &s;ays, was not &s;uited to his genius; but, in repre&s;enting a woman tran&s;ported with fury, he was incomparable. Longinus &s;ays, that Ae&s;chylus has a noble boldne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion; and that his imagination is lofty and heroic. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that he affected pompous words, and that his &s;en&s;e is too often ob&s;cured by figures: this gave Salma&s;ius occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that he was more difficult to be under&s;tood than the &s;cripture it&s;elf. But not|with&s;tanding the&s;e imperfections, this poet was held in great veneration by the Athenians, who made a public decree that his tragedies &s;hould be played after his death. He was killed in the 69th year of his age, by an eagle letting fall a tortoi&s;e upon his head as he was walking in the fields. He had the honour of a pompous funeral from the Sicilians, who buried him near the river Gela; and the tragedians of the country performed plays and theatrical exerci&s;es at his tomb.&mdash;The be&s;t edition of his plays is that of London, 1663, fol. with a Latin tran&s;lation and a learned commentary by Thomas Stanly.</P>

<HEAD>AESCULAPIUS,</HEAD>
<P>IN the Heathen mythology, the god of phy&s;ic, was the &s;on of Apollo and the nymph Coronis. He was educated by the centaur Chiron, who taught him phy&s;ic; by which means Ae&s;culapius cured the mo&s;t de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es. But Jupiter, enraged at his re&s;toring to life Hippolitus, who had been torn in pieces by his own hor&s;es, killed him with a thunderbolt. According to Cicero, there were three deities of this name: the fir&s;t, the &s;on of Apollo, wor&s;hipped in Arcadia, who invented the probe, and bandages for wounds; the &s;econd, the brother of Mercury, killed by lightning; and the third, the &s;on of Ari&s;ippus and Ar&s;inoe, who fir&s;t taught the art of tooth-drawing and purging. At Epidaurus, Ae&s;cula|pius's &s;tatue was of gold and ivory, with a long beard, his head &s;ur|rounded with rays, holding in one hand a knotty &s;tick, and the other entwined with a &s;erpent; he was &s;eated on a throne of the &s;ame materials as his &s;tatue, and had a dog lying at his feet. The Romans crowned him with laurel, to repre&s;ent his de&s;cent from Apollo; and the Phalia&s;ins repre&s;ented him as beardle&s;s. The cock, the raven, and the goat, were &s;acred to this deity. His chief temples were at Pergamus, Smyrna, Trica a city in Ionia, and the i&s;le of Coos; in all which, votive t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">blets were hung up, &s;howing the di&s;ea&s;es cured by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

He travelled through Greece, and pa&s;&s;ed by Athens &s;oon after Pi&s;i&s;tratus had a&s;&s;umed the &s;overeign power: finding the Athenians very impatient under their yoke, he told them the fable of the frogs, who petitioned Jupiter for a king. Ae&s;op was certainly happy in his inventions to in&s;truct mankind: the images he makes u&s;e of are all that is nece&s;&s;ary to perfect a precept, and are both u&s;eful and agreeable. He may be ju&s;tly e&s;teemed wi&s;e, &s;ince he wrote in an entertaining and per|&s;ua&s;ive &s;tyle, which charms and captivates the human mind. Ae&s;op &s;uf|fered death at Delphi.

For this they contrived an accu&s;ation of &s;acrilege again&s;t him; and pretending they had convicted him, threw him headlong from a rock. For this cruel action, we are told, they were vi&s;ited by a famine and pe&s;tilence: and on con&s;ulting the oracle, they received for an&s;wer, that the god de&s;igned this as a puni&s;hment for the treatment of Ae&s;op.

<HEAD>AGARD (ARTHUR),</HEAD>
<P>A LEARNED and indu&s;trious antiquary, was born 1540, and edu|cated for the practice of the law. In proce&s;s of time he became a clerk in the Exchequer office, and in 1570 deputy chamberlain of the Exche|quer, under Sir Nicholas Throgmorton; which place he held forty-five years. The great love he had for Engli&s;h antiquities led him to make large and laborious collections; and the office he held, afforded him an opportunity to acquire great &s;kill in the mo&s;t intricate part of the anti|quary's &s;tudy. A conformity of &s;tudies brought him acquainted with the elder Sir Robert Cotton, with whom he ever had a &s;trict friend&s;hip. Indeed, Anthony Wood tells us, he received all his knowledge in anti|quities from him; which is not very probable; as he came into the Ex|chequer office the &s;ame year Sir Robert Cotton was born. Be&s;ides Sir Robert Cotton, Mr. Agard had the mo&s;t learned and eminent men in the kingdom for his friends and acquaintance. There exi&s;ted, in his time, a mo&s;t illu&s;trious a&s;&s;embly of learned per&s;ons, who &s;tyled them|&s;elves a Society of Antiquaries, Mr. Agard was one of the principal members, as appears from &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es read in that &s;ociety, and &s;ince printed and publi&s;hed by Mr. Hearne. Be&s;ides five di&s;cour&s;es in this collection, and another of much older date, it is not known that our author had more in print. The&s;e, however, &s;hew, that in antiquities he had few equals, and no &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>In the bu&s;ine&s;s of his office he was particularly expert, as is evident from his di&s;covering <HI>Richardus filius Nigelli</HI> to be the author of The Di|alogue of the Exchequer, which generally goes under the name of Gi|raldus Tilburien&s;is. Mr. Madox, who publi&s;hed the Hi&s;tory of the Ex|chequer, owned that this had been di&s;covered by our author, Agard, who communicated it to the famous Selden. The Doome&s;day Book our author had made his chief and particular &s;tudy; and publi&s;hed a large and learned work on purpo&s;e to explain it; which was pre&s;erved in the Cotton library. He likewi&s;e employed three years in compo&s;ing
<PB N="62" REF="75">
a book for the ca&s;e of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; containing a catalogue of &s;uch re|cords as were in the four trea&s;uries, and an account of all leagues, trea|ties of peace, &amp;c. with foreign nations. This treati&s;e he depo&s;ited with the officers of the receipt, for the u&s;e of &s;ucceeding officers.</P>
<P>By his will he directed, that eleven other manu&s;cript treati&s;es, relative to Exchequer matters, &s;hould be delivered up to the office. All the re&s;t of his valuable collections he bequeathed to his old friend, Sir Robert Cotton; in who&s;e library as many as remain are &s;till to be found. For, notwith&s;tanding his making &s;o much u&s;e of his pen, his mode&s;ty would not permit him to publi&s;h any thing. After having thus &s;pent his days in learned tranquillity, he thought of death before it came, and cau&s;ed a monument to be erected in the cloi&s;ter, We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey, near the chapel-door. He died Augu&s;t 20, 1615. Mr. Camden &s;tyles him a mo&s;t excellent antiquary. Mr. Selden &s;ays, he was mo&s;t painful and in|du&s;trious in things of that nature.

<HEAD>AGRIPPA (HEROD),</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;on of Ari&s;tobolus, was grand&s;on of Herod the Great, and born in the year of the world 3997. After the death of his father, He|rod his grandfather completed his education, and &s;ent him to Rome, to pay his court to Tiberius. The emperor profe&s;&s;ed a great regard for Agrippa. and placed him in a &s;ituation under his &s;on Dru&s;us, who&s;e af|fection he &s;oon gained. But the &s;udden death of Dru&s;us cau&s;ed all tho&s;e who had been much e&s;teemed by him to be removed from Rome, by the command of Tiberius, who was fearful their pre&s;ence might add to his affliction. Agrippa, after having indulged his inclination almo&s;t to ex|ce&s;s, found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of quitting Rome, involved in debt, and very indigent. He abandoned the idea of returning to Jeru|&s;alem, being con&s;cious he could not make a figure there &s;uitable to his birth. For this rea&s;on he retired to the ca&s;tle of Ma&s;&s;ada, where he lived for &s;ome time, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his uncle Herod, more like a prince, than what he really was. He made him principal magi&s;trate of Tiberias, and gave him a large &s;um of money: but the expences of Agrippa were &s;o enormous, that his uncle grew weary of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, and reproached him with his extravagance. Agrippa took offence at this, and re&s;olved to return to Rome. When he arrived there, he was received favourably by Tiberius, and commanded to attend the &s;on of Dru&s;us. But Agrippa preferring Caius, the &s;on of Germanicus (and grand&s;on of the Empre&s;s Antonia), who&s;e favour he had formerly en|ioyed, attached him&s;elf to him with great a&s;&s;iduity. The behaviour and
<PB N="64" REF="77">
abilities of Agrippa made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on this prince, that he kept him con&s;tantly about his per&s;on.</P>
<P>Eutyches, a &s;lave, whom Agrippa had made free, overheard him one day expre&s;s a wi&s;h for the death of Tiberius, and advancement of Caius, which he made known to the emperor. In con&s;equence of this, Agrippa was committed to the cu&s;tody of an officer, and loaded with fetters; but was &s;oon relea&s;ed from his confinement by the death of Ti|berius, who was &s;ucceeded by Caius Caligula. The new emperor be|&s;towed many favours upon Agrippa, gave him a chain of gold in ex|change for his iron fetters, placed a crown upon his head, and granted him the tetrarchy, which Philip, the &s;on of Herod the Great, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that is, Batanaea and Trachonitis; and added to this that of Ly&s;anias. Agrippa &s;oon went to Judea, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new kingdom.</P>
<P>Caius was &s;oon after killed; and Agrippa being then at Rome, ad|vi&s;ed Claudius to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the imperial dignity, to which he had been advanced by the army. Agrippa in this affair &s;hewed more cunning and addre&s;s, than &s;incerity and hone&s;ty; for while he pretended to be in the intere&s;t of the &s;enate, he &s;ecretly prevailed upon Claudius to be re&s;olute, and not abandon his good fortune. For this advice the emperor gave him all Judea and the kingdom of Chalcis, which had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his brother Herod. Thus Agrippa became &s;uddenly one of the greate&s;t princes of the Ea&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of as many territo|ries, if not more, than Herod the Great had ever held. Agrippa now returned to Judea, and reigned with great &s;atisfaction to the Jews. But through too great a de&s;ire of plea&s;ing them, and a mi&s;taken zeal for their religion, he committed an action, the inju&s;tice of which is related in Scripture, Acts xii. 1, 2, &amp;c. For about the fea&s;t of pa&s;&s;over, in the year of Je&s;us Chri&s;t 44, St. James Major, the &s;on of Zebedee, and bro|ther to St. John the Evangeli&s;t, was &s;eized by his order, and put to death. He al&s;o laid hands on St. Peter, and impri&s;oned him, with an intent to execute him when the fe&s;tival was over. But God having mi|raculou&s;ly delivered St. Peter from his confinement, fru&s;trated the de|&s;igns of Agrippa. After the pa&s;&s;over, this prince went to Ce&s;area, and had games performed there in honour of Claudius. The inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon waited on him here, to &s;ue for peace. Agrippa came early in the morning to the theatre, with a de&s;ign to give them audi|ence; and &s;eated him&s;elf on his throne, dre&s;&s;ed in a robe of &s;ilver ti&s;&s;ue, embroidered in an elegant &s;tyle. The rays of the ri&s;ing &s;un darting on it, gave it &s;uch a lu&s;tre, that the eyes of the &s;pectators were dazzled with looking on it. And when the king &s;poke to the Tyrians or Sido|nians, the para&s;ites around &s;aid it was the voice of a god, and not that
<PB N="65" REF="78">

<HEAD>AIDAN.</HEAD>
<P>SON of Goran, king of Scotland. His father was murdered by con|&s;pirators, in the year 535, at which time this prince was very young. Eugenius, nephew to the la&s;t king, &s;ucceeded to the throne. He was a good officer and a wi&s;e prince, having gained much experience in the &s;ervice of the celebrated Arthur, king of the Britons, whom he long &s;erved under, but at the &s;ame time very artful. He laid a&s;ide all thoughts of revenging his uncle's murder, and even took into his favour Donald of Athol, who was chief promoter of it. The queen Dowager was &s;o much alarmed at this, that notwith&s;tanding his pretended friend|&s;hip for her and her family, &s;he took the fir&s;t opportunity of quitting the kingdom, and retiring, with her two &s;ons, Reginans and Aidan, into Ireland, the latter was then about &s;even years of age. They were very kindly received by Tauthalius the reigning king. The queen, and her elde&s;t &s;on, died there. Aidan continued there forty-eight years, great part of which time Eugenius reigned; and after him his brother Congallus. This la&s;t mentioned king being con&s;cious of the wrong done to the right heir of the crown, ordered Aidan to be brought home, which was un|dertaken and performed by the celebrated St. Columb. But on their ar|rival in Scotland, they were informed the king was dead, and that his brother, Kennatillus, was by the Scots put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. After the burial of the decea&s;ed prince, Columb went to court with Aidan; and, to the &s;urpri&s;e of all people, was received by the new king with much kindne&s;s and re&s;pect, he telling Aidan, he &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t him in governing the kingdom, which would become his very &s;hortly, to whom of right it pertained. The king being old and infirm, died &s;oon after, and was &s;ucceeded by Aidan, according to Bo&euml;tius, in the year 578. He was crowned king of Scotland by Columb, who, in an ele|gant oration, made for the occa&s;ion, excited the prince to ju&s;tice, and the people to obedience. Aidan went into Galloway, immediately after his coronation, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed certain robbers who had infe&s;ted that country, and committed great outrages in it. He in&s;tituted annual a&s;&s;izes there, at Lochaber, and Caithne&s;s. But &s;ome of the young no|bility quarrelling at a hunting match, &s;uddenly interrupted the&s;e works of peace. This affray ending in blood&s;hed, cau&s;ed &s;everal of them to retire into the dominions of the Briti&s;h king. Aidan, in virtue of a treaty with this prince, often demanded them, and was con&s;tantly re|fu&s;ed. Incen&s;ed at this treatment, he entered his country, took a great number pri&s;oners, and carried off a quantity of cattle. Brudeus re&s;ent|ing this, made an attack upon Galloway, and did much mi&s;chief. At length a general engagement en&s;ued, the Picts were routed with great
<PB N="67" REF="80">
&s;laughter; the Scots lo&s;t a number of men, and among&s;t them Arthur, the king's &s;on. St. Columb hearing of this war, came to the king, and charged him with &s;hewing too much willingne&s;s to &s;hed blood; this made &s;o &s;trong an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the prince, that he would not &s;uffer this excellent man to depart till he undertook to negociate a peace, which he executed with great &s;ucce&s;s. The Saxons, having driven the Britons into Wales, were now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of England. Ethelfrid, who then reigned in Northumberland, was an artful and ambitious prince. He wi&s;hed to make a conque&s;t of the Picti&s;h kingdom; but finding him&s;elf too weak to accompli&s;h it, prevailed on Brudeus to break the peace with the Scots, thinking by this means to weaken and obtain a victory over him. Aidan hearing of the&s;e negociations, con|cluded a treaty, offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, with Maelgwyn, the Briti&s;h king. As &s;oon as the Saxons were informed of this, they determined to invade the Briti&s;h territories, in order to draw the Scots from their own coun|try. This manoeuvre &s;ucceeded, for Aidan in&s;tantly marched to a&s;&s;i&s;t his allies; and, joining the Briti&s;h army, offered battle to Ethelfrid and Brudeus, which, for two rea&s;ons, they cho&s;e to decline; fir&s;t, that they were weary of the Scots; next, to give Ceuline, king of the We&s;t Saxons, an opportunity of joining them. Aidan, and his a&s;&s;o|ciates being appri&s;ed of their intention, re&s;olved to attack Ceuline, before his junction &s;hould render them too powerful. They performed this with great bravery, and by forcing their camp, cut to pieces and de&s;troyed a great number of their armies, and among them Cutha, &s;on to the king of the We&s;t Saxons. Notwith&s;tanding this, the remainder joined their friends, and offered battle a &s;econd time to Aidan, who be|haved very gallantly in this engagement, but was &s;o unfortunate as to lo&s;e his &s;on Griffin, and his nephew Brennius, Earl of Man. The Saxons and Picts had a great number of private men killed, and both their princes wounded. Ethelfrid lo&s;t one of his eyes, and Brudeus received a deep wound on his hip. Ethelfrid joined the Picts early the next &s;ummer, and with a numerous army invaded Galloway. Aidan was better prepared to receive them than they had rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e; and taking the advantage of their &s;traggling about the country, he cut off &s;everal of their parties; but finding that the&s;e lo&s;&s;es obliged them to keep clo&s;e in camp, he re&s;olved to march &s;ilently by it on a dark night, to join the Britons, and encamped in a narrow valley in Annandale, where the Saxons and Picts with a great army &s;urrounded them, and flattered them&s;elves that &s;eizing all the pa&s;&s;ages, they &s;hould ea&s;ily rout their enemies. But Aidan con&s;ulting his generals, they agreed to make great preparations, by fortifying their camp, and to appear as if they waited for an attack; when they had completed this, they lighted up a
<PB N="68" REF="81">
number of fires, and decamped in the night. By pa&s;&s;ing certain rivers, deemed not fordable by the Saxons, they entered Northumberland, de&s;troying the country with fire and &s;word. This obliged the Saxons and Picts to follow them; a pitched battle en&s;ued; the Saxons and Picts, after an ob&s;tinate engagement, were totally routed with prodi|gious &s;laughter. Ceuline, king of the We&s;t Saxons, was killed on the &s;pot. Aidan having gained this great victory, cau&s;ed all the &s;poil which they had brought out of Galloway to be re&s;tored to the right owners; a tenth of the remaining booty he gave to be di&s;tributed in alms, the re&s;t was divided equally among&s;t the Scotti&s;h and Briti&s;h &s;oldiers. All the trophies of this conque&s;t he &s;ent to St. Columb, in the i&s;land of Columb-Kill, to be depo&s;ited in his abbey.</P>
<P>He reigned quietly after this, for about eleven years, when Ethelfrid prevailed on the Picts to renew the war. Aidan, though very old, marched to the place where he expected the Briti&s;h army to have joined him; but his allies failing, gave his enemies &s;uch an advantage over him, that they cut to pieces the chief of his forces; the king him&s;elf had a narrow e&s;cape. The fall of Theobald, the king's brother, proves this to have been a hard-fought battle, the con&s;equences of which, and the news of the death of St. Columb, ha&s;tened the end of the good old king, and brought him to the grave in the year 606. He reigned thirty-two years, and was, when he died, &s;eventy-eight years old.</P>

<HEAD>AKENSIDE (MARK).</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent poet and phy&s;ician, was born at Newca&s;tle upon Tyne, on the 9th of November, 1721. He was the &s;econd &s;on of a &s;ub&s;tan|tial butcher of that town.</P>
<P>At the free-&s;chool of Newca&s;tle he received the fir&s;t part of his gram|matical education, and was afterwards put under the care of Mr. Wil|&s;on, a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, who kept a private academy at Newca&s;tle. At eighteen he was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh, with a view to be brought up for a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, his parents and relations in ge|neral being of the Pre&s;byterian per&s;ua&s;ion. He pro&s;ecuted his &s;tudies on this plan for one year only, during which time he received &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the funds which the Engli&s;h di&s;&s;enters employ in edu|cating young men of no fortune. But his views as to the mini&s;try al|tering, he turned his thoughts to phy&s;ic, and &s;crupulou&s;ly repaid his benefactors the money they had advanced him; which having been con|tributed to a different purpo&s;e, he thought it di&s;honourable to retain. Whether in relinqui&s;hing his de&s;ign to be a di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ter, he cea&s;ed to be a di&s;&s;enter, is not certainly known.</P>
<P>His genius and ta&s;te for poetry di&s;played them&s;elves when he was at the &s;chools at Newca&s;tle; and it is &s;aid that his "Plea&s;ures of Imagina|tion," and &s;everal other pieces, were fir&s;t written by him at Morpeth, while he was upon a vi&s;it to his relations, before he went to the univer|&s;ity of Edinburgh. At Edinburgh he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his poeti|cal compo&s;itions. His Ode on the Winter Sol&s;tice was certainly com|po&s;ed at that place. After &s;taying three years at Edinburgh, he removed to Leyden, where he &s;tudied two years; and there, in May 1744, took his degree of doctor in phy&s;ic. In his inaugural di&s;&s;ertation, he is &s;aid to have di&s;played his medical &s;agacity, by attacking &s;ome opinions of Leuwenhoek, and other writers, at that time very generally receiv|ed, but which have &s;ince been di&s;carded by the be&s;t phy&s;icians and phi|lo&s;ophers; and by propo&s;ing an hypothe&s;is which is now con&s;idered as founded in truth.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year his poem "on the Plea&s;ures of Imagination" appeared; which was, in general, received with great applau&s;e, and rai&s;ed his repu|tation high in the poetical world. But Mr. Warburton, &s;o much cele|brated for his learning, and afterwards Bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, being di&s;|&s;atisfied with a note in the third book, concerning the nature and objects of ridicule, thought proper, in a preface to certain remarks on his antago|ni&s;t, to make &s;ome &s;evere &s;trictures on our author, in which he attacked him as a philo&s;opher only, and not as a poet. Dr. Aken&s;ide in return was warmly vindicated by an anonymous friend, who was the late Jeremiah Dy&s;on, E&s;q.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="87">In this pamphlet, which is intitled "An Epi&s;tle to the Reverend Mr. Warburton," there are &s;everal &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervations, but the &s;tyle is un|plea&s;ant. The review of the controver&s;y, whether ridicule be the touch|&s;tone of truth, will be more &s;uitably introduced when we come to the life of Lord Shaft&s;bury, the noble author of the Characteri&s;tics. The poem "on the Plea&s;ures of Imagination" was quickly followed by "An Epi&s;tle to Curio," containing a warm invective under that name again&s;t the right honourable William Pulteney, Earl of Bath, whom he &s;tigmatizes as the betrayer of his country. Dr. Aken&s;ide was afterwards &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied with this piece, that he altered it greatly, changing it into the form of an ode, and reducing it to half the number of lines it then contained. In 1741, he publi&s;hed ten odes on different &s;ubjects; written, as he tells us, with a view to vary different manners of expre&s;&s;ion and ver&s;ification. The merit which he chiefly pretended to, was that of be|ing correct, and of carefully attending to the be&s;t models. The&s;e dif|ferent productions appeared before he was twenty-four years of age; but he was afterwards more &s;low in his publications. His Ode to the Earl of Harrington came out in 1748, and in 1758 he expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire of rouzing his countrymen by "An Ode to the Country Gentlemen of England." Few of his other poetical pieces were publi&s;hed &s;eparately, except "An Ode to Thomas Edwards, E&s;q." on the late edition of Mr. Pope's works, which had been written in 1751 (but was not printed till 1766); with a view to &s;hew the author's di&s;like to Dr. Warburton. The re&s;t of Dr. Aken&s;ide's poems have been printed in Dod&s;ley's collection.</P>
<P>His principal work as a phy&s;ician, was "A Treati&s;e on the Dy&s;entery," written in Latin, and publi&s;hed in 1764.</P>
<P>To return to the circum&s;tances of Dr. Aken&s;ide's private life:&mdash;Soon after his quitting Leyden, he &s;ettled for &s;ome time in Northampton; while here, he carried on with Dr. Dodderidge an amicable debate, con|cerning the opinions of the ancient philo&s;ophers, with regard to a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments; in which Dr. Aken&s;ide &s;upported the opinion of Cicero in this important article of natural religion. But he, either not meeting with &s;ufficient encouragement, or being ambitious of moving in a larger field, removed to Hamp&s;tead, where he re&s;ided two years and an half, and then &s;ettled in London. He had but little practice when he fir&s;t began, and in order to enable him to make a proper figure in the world, his generous and intimate friend, Mr. Dy&s;on, allowed him three hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>It is uncertain whether Mr. Dy&s;on had any bond or &s;ecurity from him on this account, but it appears that this gentleman, at his decea&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his effects, particularly his books and prints; the la&s;t he took great plea|&s;ure in collecting.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="88">Dr. Aken&s;ide in a &s;hort time gained great reputation, came into full practice, and arrived at mo&s;t of the honours incident to his profe&s;&s;ion. He was cho&s;en fellow of the royal &s;ociety, became phy&s;ician to St. Thomas's ho&s;pital; was admitted, by mandamus, to the degree of doctor in phy&s;ic in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge; and was elected a fellow of the royal college of phy&s;icians in London. Upon the &s;ettle|ment of the queen's hou&s;hold, he was appointed one of the phy&s;icians to her maje&s;ty. He died on the 23d of June, 1770, of a putrid fever, in the 49th year of his age, and was buried in the pari&s;h of St. James's, We&s;tmin&s;ter. Dr. Aken&s;ide was particularly attached to ancient literature, and was a great admirer of Plato, Cicero, and the be&s;t philo&s;ophers of antiquity. His ta&s;te and judgment in this re&s;pect are con&s;picuous in his poems, and in his notes and illu&s;trations annexed to them. That he en|tertained a &s;incere reverence for the great and fundamental principles of religion, is &s;trikingly apparent in &s;everal of his writings; e&s;pecially in his Ode to the Author of the Memoirs of the Hou&s;e of Brandenburgh: in &s;hort, Dr. Aken&s;ide's high veneration for the Supreme Being, his noble &s;entiments of the wi&s;dom of Divine Providence, and his love of virtue, &s;hine through all his poems. In his Ode to William Hall, E&s;q. with the works of Chalieu, he ju&s;tly condemns the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of that poet. His &s;trong attachment to the cau&s;e of civil and religious liberty, bears a di&s;tingui&s;hed feature in the character of his poetical writings. He embraces every opportunity of di&s;playing his zeal concerning this &s;ubject, two of his principal odes are devoted entirely to it, one of which is to the Earl of Huntingdon, the other to the Bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter. He and his friend Mr. Dy&s;on, in early life, were &s;uch &s;trenuous advo|cates for liberty in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, that they were &s;u&s;pected to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome tincture of republicani&s;m; but Dr. Aken&s;ide's poems are by no means a &s;ufficient proof of this, for when he celebrates the cau&s;e of free|dom, with a reference to our own country, he doth it in no other light than that of a zealous whig, who was warmly attached to the revolution, and to the great men who effected it. He is remarkable in te&s;tifying his veneration and regard for William III.; and if there be any truth in the &s;uppo&s;ition that he and his friend po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed republican ideas in their youth, it is more than probable that they &s;oftened, if not quite re|linqui&s;hed, the rigour of their &s;entiments. The alteration of &s;ome lines in the Ode on leaving Holland, and in that to the Earl of Huntingdon, have been taken notice of in this light; Mr. Dy&s;on, in 1772, publi&s;hed a beautiful and complete edition of Dr. Aken&s;ide's Poems, with his la&s;t corrections and amendments. The fir&s;t poem in this collection, is "The Plea&s;ures of Imagination," as it had originally appeared. We have before ob&s;erved, that it in general met with great applau&s;e, and
<PB N="76" REF="89">
rai&s;ed the author's reputation high in the poetical world. Mr. Cooper, in his fourth edition of Letters concerning Ta&s;te, has &s;poken of him in the following &s;train of commendation "For my part I am of opinion, that there is now living a poet of as genuine a genius, as this kingdom ever produced, Shake&s;peare alone excepted. The gentleman I mean is Dr. Aken&s;ide, the worthy author of "The Plea&s;ures of Imagination," the mo&s;t beautiful didactic poem that ever adorned the Engli&s;h language." Mr. Cooper, in the fir&s;t edition of his work, carried his prai&s;e of the doctor to a ridiculous height of extravagance. On the other hand, the late eminent poet, Mr. Gray, in a letter to Dr. Wharton, treats this poem with great &s;everity. "You de&s;ire to know," &s;ays he, "what character the poem of your young friend (Dr. Aken&s;ide) bears here? I wonder you a&s;k the opinion of a nation, where tho&s;e who pretend to judge, do not judge at all, and the re&s;t (the wi&s;er part) wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them, that is Dick's, and the Rainbow Coffee-hou&s;es. Your readier way would be to a&s;k the ladies who keep the bars in tho&s;e two theatres of critici&s;m. However, to &s;hew you that I am a judge as well as my countrymen, I will tell you, though I have only turned it over (any more than them), that it appears to me above the middling; and now and then, for a little while, equal to the be&s;t, particularly in de&s;cription. It is often ob&s;cure, and often un|intelligible; and too much infected with the Hutchin&s;on jargon; in &s;hort, its great fault is, that it was publi&s;hed nine years too &s;oon. And &s;o methinks, in a few words, I have very pertly di&s;patched, what per|haps might for &s;everal years have employed a very ingenious man, worth fifty of my&s;elf." The&s;e ob&s;ervations being delivered before the poem had been maturely examined, we may be allowed to think them too &s;evere, and &s;teer a middling cour&s;e between Mr. Gray and Mr. Cooper. The ob&s;curity of "The Plea&s;ures of Imagination," is mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous in the allegory of the &s;econd book. It might, likewi&s;e, have been better, if the peculiar language of Hutchin&s;on, or rather Shaft&s;bury, had &s;ometimes been omitted. Neverthele&s;s, we cannot but regard it as a noble and beautiful poem, di&s;playing great genius and fancy, and hold|ing out &s;ublime views of nature, providence, and morality. We en|tirely agree with Mr. Gray in &s;uppo&s;ing it came out too early; the author him&s;elf, afterwards, entertained the &s;ame &s;entiments. He was convinced that the poem was defective in &s;ome re&s;pects, and redundant in others. "His editor" &s;ays he "was perfectly &s;en&s;ible that it wanted revi&s;ion and correction;" but the demand was &s;o quick for &s;everal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive re-publications, that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to have com|pleted the whole of this correction; and to have gone on from time to time, making fre&s;h improvements in every edition, would he thought
<PB N="77" REF="90">
have at lea&s;t the appearance of abu&s;ing the favour of the public. On this account he continued to print it without alterations, for &s;everal years, with a view of giving at once his corrections and improvements complete to the public. He meant to review and correct this poem at his lei&s;ure, but he found the ta&s;k grow &s;o much upon his hands, that he abandoned the purpo&s;e of correcting, and determined to write it over again, upon a more enlarged, and &s;omewhat different plan. Dr. Aken&s;ide did not live to fini&s;h his plan. He de&s;igned, at fir&s;t, to compri&s;e the whole of his &s;ubject in four books, but he afterwards changed his purpo&s;e, and re&s;olved to di&s;tribute "The Plea&s;ures of Imagination" into a greater number. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how far his &s;cheme would have carried him, if he had lived to execute it; for at his death he had only fini&s;hed his fir&s;t and &s;econd books, a con&s;iderable part of the third, and the introduction to the la&s;t. The fir&s;t book of the new edition bears a &s;tronger re&s;emblance to the fir&s;t book of the former than any of the re&s;t do. There are, however, perceptible corrections, alterations, and additions. Dr. Aken&s;ide has introduced a tribute of re&s;pect to his friend Mr. Dy&s;on. He has referred "The Plea&s;ures of Imagination" to two &s;ources only, greatne&s;s and beauty. His delinea|tion of beautiful objects is greatly enlarged, and his fir&s;t book &s;eems to have received much improvement. The &s;econd book differs e&s;&s;entially from the former editions, indeed &s;o much, that they will not bear a compari&s;on. The author enters into a di&s;play of truth, and its three cla&s;&s;es; matter of fact, experimental or &s;cientifical truth, and univer&s;al truth. He treats al&s;o of virtue, as exciting in the divine mind; of hu|man virtue, of vice and its origin, of ridicule, and of the pa&s;&s;ions; what he &s;ays upon the &s;ubject of ridicule, is greatly reduced from what it was in the preceding copies. The allegorical vi&s;ion, which con&s;tituted a principal part of the &s;econd book, in his fir&s;t poem, is likewi&s;e omitted. The character of the &s;econd book as it now &s;tands is, that it is correct, moral, and noble. The third book is an epi&s;ode, in which Solon the Athenian lawgiver is the chief &s;ubject; this part is entirely new, and would have proved a beautiful addition to the poem, if Dr. Aken&s;ide had lived to fini&s;h it, it is greatly to be regreted that he died before he completed his de&s;ign. We &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding, have been &s;orry to have had the original poem entirely &s;uper&s;eded, for whatever may be its faults, we find in it a certain brightne&s;s of imagination, and a degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m, which &s;eem to have for&s;aken the doctor in the latter part of his life.</P>

advi&s;ed, into Lanca&s;hire, where he was born; and there, without any re|gard to his own &s;afety, exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in making con|verts, and di&s;&s;uading &s;uch as were already Catholics from going to heretical conventicles. In order to carry his point the more effectually, he wrote, and di&s;tributed &s;everal little pieces, which were afterwards printed; but rendered him&s;elf &s;o obnoxious to the government by the&s;e endeavours, that a &s;trict &s;earch was made after him by the magi&s;trates; which forced him to quit that country, and to &s;eek an a&s;ylum in the neighbourhood of the city of Oxford, where he concealed him&s;elf for &s;ome time. In this retreat, he wrote a kind of apology for his party, under the title of "Brief Rea&s;ons concerning the Catholic Faith. Some indeed &s;ay, this was written at the hou&s;e of the Duke of Norfolk, in Norfolk, where it is certain Alan was concealed &s;ome time, though he returned again into the neighbourhood of Oxford, where he di&s;tributed copies of the work, to fix the minds of tho&s;e who wavered between the two religions; and to draw over &s;uch as already doubted their &s;afety, while remaining in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Such &s;ucce&s;s attended his endeavours, that he refu&s;ed to take the opportunity of a &s;hip going to the Netherlands, and cho&s;e to &s;tay in that dangerous &s;ituation, promoting as far as lay in his power the doctrine of popery, and the juri&s;diction of his Holine&s;s, and &s;uch as derived their authority from him. With this view, he ventured to e&s;tabli&s;h a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of his old friends in the univer&s;ity, and among the re&s;t, with a per&s;on who was formerly a Papi&s;t, but then of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and one of who&s;e preferment his family had great hopes; our author, by his unwearied applications drew back this man to his former opinions, which ex|a&s;perated his relations &s;o much, that they per&s;ecuted Alan with unre|mitted diligence; this obliged him to fly towards London; and not long after, with &s;ome difficulty he made his e&s;cape into Flanders in 1568, having remained in England three years. It is more than proba|ble he had &s;ome great friends here, who, in re&s;pect to their former ac|quaintance with him, were well plea&s;ed at his withdrawing a &s;econd time beyond &s;ea. Among&s;t whom we may reckon Sir Chri&s;topher Hatton, afterwards chancellor, who received part of his education in St. Mary's Hall, at Oxford, while our author was principal thereof. On this account, Sir Chri&s;topher had a great regard for Alan; and Alan en|tertained &s;o high an opinion of him, that he rai&s;ed his reputation to the greate&s;t height abroad, which cau&s;ed &s;ome invidious reflections at home. After Alan came a &s;econd time into the Spani&s;h low countries, he went to Mechlin, in the dutchy of Brabant, and read a divinity lecture in a mona&s;tery there, with great applau&s;e. He went from thence to Douay, where he became doctor in divinity, and took great pains to e&s;tabli&s;h a
<PB N="80" REF="93">
&s;eminary there, for the &s;upport of Engli&s;h &s;cholars; this being looked upon with an evil eye by the government in England, cau&s;ed him to write a book in defence of &s;uch in&s;titutions. While he was thus em|ployed, he was made canon of Cambray, a very con&s;iderable and honour|able preferment, conferred on him purely to reward his zeal for the catholic church. In this &s;eminary of Douay, many books were wrote to ju&s;tify the popi&s;h religion, and to an&s;wer the books wrote in defence of the church of England, which occa&s;ioned queen Elizabeth to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation, forbidding &s;uch books to be either &s;old or read. In 1567, our author, Alan, appointed one Bri&s;tow, who became afterwards a very eminent man, moderator of &s;tudies at Douay; this Bri&s;tow, in all probability, was the man whom Alan drew over to his opinions when he was in England, as is before mentioned. Not long after, Dr. Alan was appointed canon of Rheims, through the intere&s;t of the Gui&s;es, and to this city he transferred the &s;eminary which had been &s;ettled at Douay; his motive for making this alteration, was, becau&s;e Don Lewis de Reque|&s;ens, the then governor of the Netherlands, had obliged the Engli&s;h fugitives to withdraw out of his government. From this time Dr. Alan was e&s;teemed the chief of his party; and indeed he laboured ince&s;&s;antly to do it &s;ervice, by writing various treati&s;es in defence of the doctrines, and &s;everal by way of apology for the practices of the Papi&s;ts; by licen&s;ing and recommending many books written by others, and by journies into Spain and Italy. By his diligence he procured a &s;eminary to be e&s;tabli&s;hed at Rome, and two others in Spain, where Engli&s;h &s;tudents were not only educated, but were al&s;o maintained, and provided for. At home, Dr. Alan was ju&s;tly reputed a capital enemy of the &s;tate; all corre&s;pondence with him was looked upon as the highe&s;t kind of trea&s;on, and Thomas Alfield, a Je&s;uit, was actually executed for bringing cer|tain books of his writing into England. The celebrated Robert Par&s;ons, the Je&s;uit, was Dr. Alan's great friend and coun&s;ellor, and very probably put him upon that de&s;perate project, which, if it had &s;ucceeded, would have overwhelmed the Engli&s;h; and which, as it mi&s;carried, did in a manner enervate the Spani&s;h monarchy. For many years there had been differences, di&s;contents, and even actual injuries committed between the Engli&s;h and the Spaniards; but now Dr. Alan, and the fugitive noblemen from England prevailed upon King Philip the &s;econd openly to undertake the conque&s;t of their native country. To facilitate this, Sixtus the fifth, who was then pope, was per&s;uaded to renew the excom|munication thundered again&s;t Queen Elizabeth by his predece&s;&s;or Pope Pius V. While this was in agitation, Sir William Stanley, who com|manded a con&s;iderable garri&s;on of Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h in the important town of Daventer, ba&s;ely betrayed it, and went with his whole regi|ment

of twelve hundred men into that &s;ervice. Rowland York, who had been likewi&s;e intru&s;ted with a &s;trong fort in the &s;ame country, acted in the like infamous manner, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;tates general of the United Provinces, and brought much &s;candal on the Engli&s;h nation. Dr. Alan wrote a treati&s;e in defence of this ba&s;e proceeding, and &s;ent &s;everal prie&s;ts to Stanley, in order to in&s;truct tho&s;e he had drawn over to the king of Spain's &s;ervice. To add to the weight of tho&s;e writings, the Dr. on the twenty-eighth of July, 1587, was created cardinal, by the title of St. Martin in Montibus, and &s;oon after the king of Spain gave him an abbey of great value, in the kingdom of Naples, with &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of much greater preferment, which was afterwards performed. In April 1588, he compo&s;ed that work which rendered him famous abroad, and infamous at home. It con&s;i&s;ted of two parts, the fir&s;t explaining the pope's bull, for the excommunication and deprivation of Queen Elizabeth; the &s;econd exhorting the nobility, and people of England to de&s;ert her, and take up arms in favour of the Spaniards. Of this book it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that it was by far the &s;evere&s;t piece ever written again&s;t an Engli&s;h prince, and very capable of producing mi&s;chievous effects; many papi&s;ts are inclined to believe that the cardinal was compelled to take this book upon him&s;elf, and that in reality it was either written or altered by Father Par&s;ons and other Je&s;uits. Many thou&s;and copies were printed at Antwerp, in order to have been put on board the Spani&s;h armada, that they might have been di&s;tributed by the Papi&s;ts all over England, upon the fir&s;t landing of the Spaniards. But this enterprize failing, the&s;e books were &s;o carefully de&s;troyed, that very few were pre&s;erved. One of the printed copies was tran&s;mitted by &s;ome of the lord trea&s;urer's &s;pies, to the Engli&s;h council, and Queen Elizabeth &s;ent Dr. Dale into the Low Countries, to make a complaint of &s;uch a proceeding to the Prince of Parma, who pretended to have much friend&s;hip for her maje&s;ty. He heard this account with a great deal of phlegm; and an&s;wered, that as he knew of no &s;uch book, he could not &s;ay any thing to its contents. After the armada was de&s;troyed, Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, who had been three years in pri&s;on, under the charge of high trea&s;on, was brought to his trial, and the great charge upon him was, his corre&s;ponding with cardinal Alan, which being proved, he was found guilty by the peers. In the &s;ame year the king of Spain promoted the cardinal, as he had promi&s;ed him, to the archbi&s;hopric of Mechlin, in Flanders, where he would have wi&s;hed him to have con&s;tantly re&s;ided, in order to his more effec|tually cheri&s;hing the Popi&s;h and Spani&s;h intere&s;ts in England. But the pope entertained &s;o high an opinion of the cardinal's merit, and found him of &s;uch great &s;ervice in con&s;i&s;tories, that he would not &s;uffer him to
<PB N="82" REF="95">
leave Rome, where he continued to labour as earne&s;tly as ever in the &s;ervice of his countrymen, and the catholic faith. It has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, that he and Sir Francis Englefield a&s;&s;i&s;ted Father Par&s;ons in compo&s;ing his traiterous book concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which he publi&s;hed under the name of Doleman, and which was of &s;uch danger|ous con&s;equence, that it was made capital by law for any per&s;on to have it in his cu&s;tody. Others affirm that he had no hand in it, and was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with this treati&s;e, as it tended to perpetuate tho&s;e di&s;&s;entions, which had for &s;o many years torn and di&s;tracted his nativ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> country. The remainder of his life he &s;pent at Rome in great honour and reputation, living in much &s;plendor, and u&s;ing all his intere&s;t for the comfort and maintenance of &s;uch poor catholics as fled out of England. The admini&s;tration here had many &s;pies upon him, and it appeared by the papers of the trea&s;urer Burleigh, that he had con&s;tantly very di&s;tinct accounts of every &s;tep the cardinal took. In the la&s;t years of his life, he is &s;aid to have changed his &s;entiments, as to government, and to hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> been heartily &s;orry for the pains he took in promoting the inva&s;ion of England by the Spaniards: and we are told by a very eminent Popi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> writer, that when he perceived the Je&s;uits' intended nothing but de&s;o|lating and de&s;troying his native land, he wept bitterly, not knowing how to remedy it, much le&s;s to bridle their in&s;olence.

On his death-bed he was very de&s;irous of &s;peaking to the Engli&s;h &s;tudents then in Rome, but was pre+vented by a Je&s;uit, who was father rector, and was fearful he &s;houl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have per&s;uaded them to a loyal re&s;pect for their prince, and a tender re+gard for their country.

him, that he was well gone, for if he had lived but a little longer, he would have di&s;graced him&s;elf, &s;hamed his country, and lo&s;t the credit he had gained; yet they &s;hortly after, for many rea&s;ons, altered their tone; and when they found how little credit the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es met with, they mag|nified the cardinal's memory, as if he lived a &s;aint, and died a confe&s;|&s;or. But in order to give the reader a proper idea of this behaviour we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that before the Spani&s;h inva&s;ion, in 1582, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome Engli&s;hman promoted to the rank of cardinal. The candidates were Dr. Lewis, Bi&s;hop of Ca&s;&s;ana, and Dr. Alan; and much intere&s;t was made on both &s;ides. But the Je&s;uits being apprehen&s;ive of Bi&s;hop Lewis's coming to the honour, it was procured for him of whom we are writing; when they found he would not go the&s;e lengths, they treated him as ill as ever they had done any of their greate&s;t enemies. They were &s;till fearful that Bi&s;hop Lewis might put on that hat which Alan had left, and began to ob&s;erve in all companies, that the cardinal was a perfect &s;aint, that he was ju&s;tly admired by &s;everal popes, re&s;pected by all the princes of Europe, who either knew, or heard of him; that his whole &s;tudy was for the good of his country, and the maintenance of the catholic religion; that notwith&s;tanding all this, the Bi&s;hop of Ca&s;&s;ana had made it the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to per&s;ecute and di&s;turb this holy man. We &s;hall, no doubt, find it a difficult ta&s;k to give this eminent per&s;on his true character: however, &s;ince it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, we &s;hall attempt to do it with as much truth as po&s;&s;i|ble, and from the be&s;t authority. If we con&s;ider him as an Engli&s;h &s;ubject, writing, advi&s;ing, and acting again&s;t his prince, we mu&s;t look upon him as a bu&s;y, enterprizing, and dangerous rebel, labouring con|tinually the de&s;truction of his prince, and her people, equally ready to per&s;uade foreigners to invade, or &s;ubjects to ri&s;e up in arms: and if on the other hand, we look on him as a zealous papi&s;t, and as one con|vinced in his con&s;cience, that what he did was agreeable to the doctrines of the church, we cannot then deny him the title of a learned, active, and indu&s;trious per&s;on; and far from being an enemy, in the latter part of his life particularly, either to his country or to his lawful &s;overeign Queen Elizabeth. La&s;tly, taking him merely as an author, he was un|que&s;tionably, for matter, method, wit, learning, and language, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable writers of the age. It is &s;trange, that many of our writers of controver&s;y, and &s;ome not unlearned, have treated our author as a Je&s;uit; whereas, in all controver&s;ies between that order and the &s;ecular prie&s;ts, the latter always gloried in Cardinal Alan, as a man to whom no Je&s;uit could be ju&s;tly compared in any re&s;pect. Before we clo&s;e this life, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to remark, that at Rome, and every where abroad, Cardinal Alan was &s;tyled Cardinal of England, regarded
<PB N="84" REF="97">
as the protector of the nation, and honoured with extraordinary re&s;pect. He had about him &s;everal per&s;ons of &s;ome di&s;tinction, particularly Mr. Fitzherbert, who wrote a large account of his life, which was never printed. To maintain his magnificence, he had 15,000 crowns per annum, then computed 4,500 pounds of our money.</P>

<HEAD>ALAND (SIR JOHN FORTESCUE). [Never before publi&s;hed.]</HEAD>
<P>ALAND, Sir John Forte&s;cue, LLD. R.S.S. baron of the Exche|quer, pui&s;ne judge of both benches to king George the Fir&s;t, and a peer of Ireland in the &s;ub&s;equent reign; was born 7th March, A. D. 1670. Being &s;econd &s;on to Edmund Forte&s;cue, of London, E&s;q. by Sarah his wife.</P>
<P>Our judge was de&s;cended from Sir John Forte&s;cue, lord chief ju&s;tice, and lord high chancellor of England, under King Henry the Sixth. [See Greg. Pref. ap. Forte&s;c. de Laud. Leg. Angl. V. Hickes' Pref. ap. The&s;aur. XLVI.] Sir John Forte&s;cue Aland added his latter name of Aland in compliment to his lady, who was the elde&s;t daughter to Henry Aland, E&s;q. of Waterford, in our &s;i&s;ter kingdom; and &s;ure it was a very great compliment indeed (whether the &s;ame was paid to mental accompli&s;hments, per&s;onal charms, or large fortune) to &s;uffer any name to &s;uper&s;ede that of Forte&s;cue, in the honour of his de&s;cent from which ance&s;tor he &s;eems to have gloried very much.</P>
<P>Whether our judge was educated at a public &s;chool, or privately at home, we have not been able to learn, but that he was at college, &s;eems not to admit a doubt; becau&s;e Oxford complimented him with the ho|norary degrees of doctor of laws, as a member of that univer&s;ity, if the following extract from the diploma (which may be &s;een prefixed to his volume of Reports) authorizes us in the a&s;&s;ertion, viz. "mir&acirc; &s;em|per in has mu&s;arum &s;edes benevolenti&acirc; propendentem, nec minorem inde reportantem."</P>
<P>Sir John Forte&s;cue Aland, as an Oxonian, greatly improved his na|tural endowments, and de&s;ervedly had the reputation of being a general &s;cholar [See Greg. Pr. ap. Forte&s;cue de Laud. Leg. Angl. V.] and as he was intended for the profe&s;&s;ion of the Law, upon leaving the univer&s;ity, he, Sir John, became a member of the Inner Temple, where he was cho&s;en reader in the year 1716, 2 Geo.

<P>He was called to the bar about the happy aera of the glorious Revo|lution; this we a&s;&s;ert from conjecture, made on the following calculation: Sir John Forte&s;cue Aland was born in the year 1670, and the Re|volution happened in 1690, &s;o that our barri&s;ter was at that period twenty years old, the u&s;ual age at which young gentlemen are gene|rally called to the bar.

<P>On Monday the 9th of June, 1727, Trinity term, 13 Geo. I. Mr. Ju&s;tice Aland, in a very &s;erious &s;peech, pronounced &s;entence for the execution of Major Oneby, convicted on a &s;pecial verdict, found at the Old Bailey, in February &s;e&s;&s;ions, 12 Geo.

This ought to be a caution to people, not to make u&s;e of &s;uch &s;ort of expre&s;&s;ions, as many are apt to do, in heat, anger, vexation, and pa&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Robert Price, &s;enior Baron, afterwards a Judge of the Bench.</P>
<P>The opinions of all the judges, with their rea&s;ons, are in&s;erted at large, in our article of the la&s;t-mentioned judge, viz. Sir Robert Price.</P>
<P>Ten judges were of opinion (which, with the rea&s;ons at large, may be &s;een in our judge's Reports) that their education and the approbation of their marriages did belong to his maje&s;ty; but we very much doubt the authenticity of the &s;aid general a&s;&s;ertion of the cau&s;e for removing Sir John Forte&s;cue Aland, becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty King George the Second hath immortalized his fame as the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the world in three memorable in&s;tances, viz. of Major Oneby, above mentioned, Admiral Byng, and Earl Ferrers, names that will ever &s;ecure his maje&s;ty in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that tran&s;cendant character; for though the king admired the valour of his army, honoured the bravery of his navy, and revered the exalted rank of the nobility, yet his maje&s;ty at the &s;ame time abhorred the cruelty of a &s;oldier, in the per&s;on of Major Oneby; dete&s;ted a da&s;tard &s;eaman, in that of Admiral Byng; and execrated the ba&s;ene&s;s of a peer, in the per&s;on of Earl Ferrers; and, therefore, the fir&s;t was to have been executed, had he not committed &s;uicide; the next was &s;hot for cowardice; and the third, though a baron of the realm, hanged for murder at Tyburn. But yet, though his maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to execute the law with Roman &s;trictne&s;s, he did it al&s;o with Roman ju&s;tice, for he gave the two
<PB N="90" REF="105">
honourable delinquents an opportunity, not only to vindicate their inno|cence, but al&s;o to avail them&s;elves of every circum&s;tance in point of law, and that too after judgment, condemnation, and &s;entence; for he re&s;pited the execution of the admiral, in order that he might have the opinion, not only of the twelve judges, but al&s;o of the high court of parliament, which he had. The judges were unanimous in confirming the &s;entence of the court-martial, and the parliament declined impeach|ing it, or otherwi&s;e to interfere in their public capacity on his behalf.</P>
<P>Earl Ferrers being tried before the Hou&s;e of Lords, where all the twelve judges attended during the whole trial, the ju&s;tice, the integrity, the abilities, and the candor of the judicature, rendered it the mo&s;t ho|nourable and faire&s;t trial that man could po&s;&s;ibly have here on earth.</P>
<P>Nothing appearing on the&s;e very extraordinary proceedings in favour of either the illu&s;trious pri&s;oners, they were both executed in the man|ner above related; as to all private interce&s;&s;ion, his maje&s;ty told the friends of the admiral, that he could &s;hew him no mercy, as a king; and to the latter, none as a man; and a&s;ked, "Whether if the earl's &s;teward had murdered his lord&s;hip, the &s;ervant would have found even a &s;ingle friend at court?"</P>
<P>Could a prince thus eminent for his regard to public ju&s;tice, remove a judge, merely for giving his opinion in his judicial capacity, for exe|cuting his office faithfully, impartially, hone&s;tly, and according to the be&s;t of his &s;kill and knowledge, without fear or affection, prejudice or malice, becau&s;e his opinion happened to counteract the wi&s;hes of the heir apparent to the crown? incredible! e&s;pecially &s;ince his predece&s;&s;or, Sir William Ga&s;coigne, chief ju&s;tice of England, hath been univer&s;ally admired for his courage in committing &s;uch heir, in the time of King Henry the Fourth; be&s;ides, his royal highne&s;s well knew, that the point was a public matter, a national concern, and there|fore that it would have been highly indecent in our judge to have &s;uf|fered his own private per&s;onal &s;atisfaction to have interfered; in that &s;uch conduct would militate again&s;t &s;ome of the mo&s;t approved as well as ancient maxims of the law; &s;uch as, for in&s;tance, "Salus populi &s;u|prema lex e&s;to;" "Privatum commodum publico cedat, ne re&s;pub. periat, aut quid detrimenti capiat;" "Lex citius tolerare vult privatum dam|num, quam publicum incommodum," and the like: and this is not all, for the Prince of Wales could not but con&s;ider, that in time he might him&s;elf become king, and a grandfather in the lifetime of the father; &s;o that taking our judge's opinion in this point of view, it was really a&s;&s;erting and &s;upporting the prince's future authority, in a bu&s;ine&s;s of the very like nature.</P>
<P>If the prince, when &s;overeign, did &s;uper&s;ede our judge actually for the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by the lord chief ju&s;tice Raymond, he mu&s;t, and de|&s;ervedly

too, have incurred the odium of an unju&s;t, tyrannical de&s;pot; for it ought to be recollected, that Sir John Forte&s;cue Aland was the younge&s;t of the twelve judges at the time the opinion in que&s;tion was given, which was in the year 1717, and that the prince did not accede to the throne till the year 1727, ten years after the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;plea&s;ure, for no abu&s;e of language, no mi&s;con&s;truction of actions, can torture our judge's opinion into an offence.</P>
<P>George the Second was plea&s;ed not only to continue Sir Peter King (who was one of the ten judges that gave his opinion on the &s;aid que&s;tion, which was called the grande&s;t prerogative of the royal family), in fa|vour of King George the Fir&s;t, in his office of chief ju&s;tice of the bench, but al&s;o made him lord high chancellor.</P>
<P>So that George the Second mu&s;t have conceived an in&s;uperable per|&s;onal antipathy to Sir John Forte&s;cue Aland, and that too for ten years together, <HI>tantaene animis coele&s;tibus irae!</HI> and have acted therein in direct oppo&s;ition to the great example of his royal Sire, on the very &s;ame oc|ca&s;ion of affront; it cannot be; for a king of the di&s;po&s;ition of George the Second would, on the contrary, revere a judge of &s;uch Roman forti|tude, and ble&s;&s;ed with all the cardinal virtues of his office, courage, integrity, and abilities; and who gave &s;o convincing a proof of his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every qualification requi&s;ite for forming the complete character of a judge. But be our arguments well founded or not, and whether his late maje&s;ty did act from the unju&s;t motive above &s;ugge&s;ted, he &s;oon &s;atisfied mankind and the judge that all re&s;entment had &s;ub&s;ided, and that he was re&s;olved to pay to our judge the tribute due to his merit; for, upon the death of Spencer Cowper, (which happened the very next year after Sir John Forte&s;cue Aland's removal) his maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to con&s;titute him one of the ju&s;tices of his court of common pleas, viz. 27 January 1728, Hilary Term, 2 Geo. II.; and what is rather a &s;in|gular circum&s;tance, he &s;ucceeded Spencer Cowper, who &s;ucceeded our judge, on being &s;uper&s;eded in manner and for the cau&s;e abovementioned.</P>

Diocletian. He then returned home, and &s;ettled in the town of Verulam, where he was highly e&s;teemed by his countrymen, till the per&s;ecution under the emperor, through the example and in&s;tructions of Amphibalus, he renounced the errors of Pagani&s;m, in which he had been educated, and became a thorough convert to the Chri&s;tian religion. He was put to death in the year of Chri&s;t 303, during the tenth, and la&s;t general per&s;ecution of the church. The &s;tory of his martyrdom, as related by Bede, is as follows:</P>
<P>The Roman governor being informed that he entertained in his hou&s;e Amphibalus, who was a Chri&s;tian, and not knowing that Alban had be|come one, &s;ent a party of &s;oldiers to apprehend his gue&s;t. But Alban putting on the habit of his vi&s;itor, pre&s;ented him&s;elf to the officers in his &s;tead, and was carried before the magi&s;trate. The firmne&s;s with which he behaved, and the declaration he made of his conver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, &s;o enraged the judge, that he ordered him to be beheaded immediately. He had to pa&s;s over a bridge in his way to execution, which was &s;o thronged with &s;pectators, that his pa&s;&s;age was impeded. The &s;aint, impatient for the crown of martyrdom, approached the brink, (&s;ays the hi&s;torian) and lifting up his eyes to heaven, the &s;tream was miraculou&s;ly divided, and afforded a pa&s;&s;age for him&s;elf and a thou&s;and people. This miracle converted the executioner, who threw away his drawn &s;word, and falling at St. Alban's feet, de&s;ired he might have the honour to die with him, or rather for him. This &s;udden con|ver&s;ion of the executioner, occa&s;ioning a delay in the execution, St. Alban walked up to a neighbouring hill, where praying for water to quench his thir&s;t, a fountain &s;prung up under his feet. Here he received the crown of martyrdom, on the tenth of the kalends of July. The executioner was a &s;ignal example of divine vengeance; for, at the in&s;tant that the &s;troke was given to the &s;aint, his eyes dropped out of his head. The behaviour of St. Alban at his death, and the miraculous circum&s;tances attending it, were in&s;trumental in converting many of the &s;pectators to Chri&s;tianity. Between four and five hundred years afterwards, Offa, king of the Mercians, built a very large and &s;tately mona&s;tery to the memory of St. Alban, in the place where he &s;uffered martyrdom.</P>

<P>A NATIVE of Portugal.&mdash;Little is known of this great commander before he was appointed by his king, Emanuel, to the command of a &s;qua|dron de&s;tined for India, where by his exploits he rai&s;ed the arms of his country to the highe&s;t pitch of glory.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="110">Emanuel, A.D. 1503, di&s;patched &s;ix &s;hips to India, under the command of Albuquerque, and the &s;ame year three more under his cou&s;in, Francis Albuquerque. The latter arrived in India &s;ome time before the other, with two &s;hips only, the other having peri&s;hed by the way. Arriving at the i&s;lands of Anchedive, he found &s;ome Portugueze officers, from whom he learned the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of their ally Trimumpar, King of Cochin, and &s;ailed to Vipian, where the king then was. The arrival of the Portugueze &s;o alarmed the garri&s;on that then had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Cochin, that they precipitately left it. Here one of the &s;hips that had &s;ailed from Portugal with Alphon&s;o, joined him. Francis re&s;tored Trimumpar to his capital, and &s;ubdued &s;ome i&s;lands near it.</P>
<P>Having rendered the king &s;uch e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, he de&s;ired leave to build a fort as a mutual defence again&s;t their enemies; this was granted, and the fort immediately begun. Four days after it began, Alphon&s;o joined him, and with the additional number of hands he brought with him it was &s;oon completed.</P>
<P>A con&s;ultation was then held among the Portugueze officers, when it was re&s;olved to attack &s;ome towns belonging to the Prince of Repel&s;in, about twenty miles di&s;tant from Cochin.

They returned to Cochin, and the &s;ame night made an attack on &s;ome other villages. When Alphon&s;o being advanced with a fre&s;h party, was attacked by &s;ome of the enemy who lay in ambu&s;h, and in this dangerous &s;ituation &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his courage, having fought with great intrepidity till break of day, when his brother Francis came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The Portugueze then put the enemy to flight, pur&s;ued, and &s;lew a great number of them.</P>
<P>The fame of the Portugueze being &s;pread every where, Alphon&s;o Albuquerque &s;ailed to Coulon to load three &s;hips, which he completed without oppo&s;ition, made an alliance with the people, and returned to Cochin. On his return, he found the Zamorin ready to enter into a a treaty of peace with him, which was concluded.</P>
<P>The two brothers &s;oon after &s;ailed to Cananor, and thence proceeded for Portugal. Alphon&s;o arrived &s;afe at Li&s;bon; but it is mo&s;t probable Francis peri&s;hed at &s;ea, as he was never more heard of.</P>
<P>In 1508, Alphon&s;o was appointed to &s;ucceed to the government of India, and di&s;patched with five &s;hips; he &s;ailed in company with Cugna, another Portugueze officer. Having plundered and taken &s;ome towns on the coa&s;t of Arabia, they &s;ailed to Zocatora, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the fort there. After which Cugna returned to Portugal, and Albu|querque began to act alone.</P>
<P>He immediately formed the de&s;ign of attacking Ormuz i&s;land, &s;ituated at the mouth of the Per&s;ian Gulph, and &s;ubject to a king of its own,

&s;hips, and evacuate the city, which he effected after a fierce combat, having fir&s;t &s;et fire to the magazines.</P>
<P>He then &s;teered to a place called Rapander to winter; but the enemy &s;oon obliged him to remove, and take &s;helter between the continent and the i&s;land of Divar, where he was informed his enemies were al&s;o pre|paring to make an attack upon him. In this extremity, being al&s;o very &s;care of provi&s;ions, he determined to make a de&s;perate effort on a &s;trong ca&s;tle, called Pangin. Accordingly, having &s;tationed a force to prevent &s;uccours being &s;ent to it, he proceeded under cover of the night, and &s;ucceeded in &s;urpri&s;ing both the fort and camp of the enemy, both which were taken without much re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Such an unexpected turn of good fortune determined him not only to object to offers of peace, but al&s;o to make an attack on Goa. In this he &s;ucceeded, having in the attack killed 3000 of the enemy.</P>
<P>Such &s;ucce&s;s induced him to aim at greater enterprizes. Having col|lected his forces, he &s;ailed from Goa for the i&s;land of Sumatra, and in every voyage made many captures; there having concluded a treaty with the princes of this i&s;land, he proceeded to the city of Malacca, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it. Having &s;ettled affairs there, he returned to Goa, laid &s;eige to the city of Bena&s;tar, and having been un&s;ucce&s;sful, con|&s;ented to a peace with the Zamorin. He then built a fort at Calicut, and &s;ailed to Aden, in hopes of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, but was di&s;ap|pointed, and obliged to return. Soon after he fell &s;ick and died, having fir&s;t had the mortification to hear of his being recalled by the king.</P>
<P>To this great man the Portugueze owe the foundation of the immen&s;e power they once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in India; and, had they pur&s;ued the maxims he laid down, might po&s;&s;ibly have enjoyed to this day. He was a man of great humanity, dreaded for his bravery, and beloved for his benevo|lent di&s;po&s;ition. His death was mo&s;t &s;incerely felt by all the people of Goa, where he was buried with great funeral honours.</P>

<P>IN elevation of birth, yielded to none of the Greeks; he was the &s;on of Clinias, nephew of Pericles, and lineally de&s;cended from Ajax; in his per&s;on, while a youth, he was beautiful, and when a man, remark|able for his comeline&s;s: his fortune was large beyond mo&s;t of the nobi|lity of Athens. His abilities were &s;o great, that an ancient author (C. Nepos) has a&s;&s;erted that nature in him had exerted her utmo&s;t force, &s;ince, whether we con&s;ider his virtues or his vices, he was di&s;tingui&s;hed from all his fellow citizens; he was learned, eloquent, indefatigable, liberal, magnificent, affable, and knew exactly how to comply with the times; that is, he could a&s;&s;ume all tho&s;e virtues when he thought pro|per;
<PB N="98" REF="113">
for, when he gave a loo&s;e to his pa&s;&s;ions, he was indolent, luxu|rious, di&s;&s;olute, addicted to women, intemperate, and even inclined to profanene&s;s. Socrates had a great friend&s;hip for him, corrected in &s;ome degree his manners, and brought him to the knowledge of many things of which he would otherwi&s;e have remained ignorant; he al&s;o prevented the Athenians from re&s;enting many of tho&s;e wanton acts of pride and vanity which he committed when a lad. His family had al|ways been on good terms with the Lacedemonians; Clinias, his father, indeed, di&s;claimed their friend&s;hip, but Aleibiades renewed it, and affected to &s;hew great re&s;pect to people of that country, until he ob|&s;erved the amba&s;&s;adors of Lacedemon applied them&s;elves wholly to Ni|cias, his rival, and his dependants; he then re&s;ented it very much, and u&s;ed every influence to work on the minds of the Athenians to the pre|judice of that people.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t public affair of any material con&s;equence in which he em|barked, was &s;oon after the peace for fifty years was concluded between the Athenians and Lacedemonians; &s;ome di&s;contents &s;till prevailed. The people of Athens had complied with the terms of the peace, but the Lacedemonians having got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of and demoli&s;hed the town of Panactus, made them unea&s;y; the&s;e di&s;contents were heightened by Alcibiades, who began now to rival Nicias, who, with his party, at that time ruled in Athens. Alcibiades declaimed, that the Spartans were now taking mea&s;ures for humbling Argos, that they might after|wards attack the Athenians; he artfully put them in mind of Nicias having declined making a de&s;cent on Spacteria, and drew conclu&s;ions from thence very much again&s;t him. When the amba&s;&s;adors from Sparta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> arrived, and were introduced into the &s;enate by Nicias, as they retired, Alcibiades, as the old friend of their nation, invited them to his hou&s;e, a&s;&s;ured them of his friend&s;hip, and per&s;uaded them to declare that they were not ve&s;ted with full powers (although they had in the &s;enate de|clared they were), to avoid making unrea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions. When therefore, they fir&s;t appeared in the forum, Alcibiades addre&s;&s;ed him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the people, &s;aying, <HI>You &s;ee, my countrymen, what credit ought to be give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Lacedemonians, who deny to you to-day what they affirmed ye&s;terday.</HI> The people actually refu&s;ed to hear them.</P>
<P>Alcibiades next promoted a league with the Argives, in order to keep the war at a di&s;tance, in ca&s;e the feuds between Sparta and Athens were revived. This happened in the twelfth year of the Peloponne&s;ian war&punc; The next &s;ummer he was inve&s;ted with the command of a con&s;iderable army, pa&s;&s;ed into the territory of Argos and to Patrae; at both places he laboured to per&s;uade them to build walls towards the &s;ea, to enabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

them to receive &s;uccours from Athens; but jealou&s;y of the Athenian power prevented them. No action took place this year.</P>
<P>Two years after, &s;ome di&s;&s;en&s;ions taking place at Argos, Alcibiades &s;ailed with a fleet of twenty &s;hips into their territories, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his friends, and put an end to their di&s;putes. To effect this, he cau&s;ed three hundred of the inhabitants, who were &s;u&s;pected of favouring the Lacedemonians, to be &s;eized and carried away. After this, he &s;ailed to the i&s;land of Melos, which, although &s;mall and of incon&s;iderable force, had always acted with inflexible ob&s;tinacy again&s;t the Athenians. Alcibiades laid &s;iege to it; but finding the &s;iege attended with diffi|culties, he turned it into a blockade, and leaving a con&s;iderable body of forces there, returned to Athens: the place afterwards &s;urrendered at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The Athenians, in the &s;ixteenth year of the war, determined to &s;end a fleet into Sicily, to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Egi&s;tines; Nicias was ap|pointed to command, Alcibiades and Lamachus as his colleagues. Dur|ing the preparations for this expedition, an accident happened which put the whole city of Athens into confu&s;ion: the Hermae, or &s;tatues of Mercury, of which there were a multitude in the city and neighbour|hood, were all defaced in one night, nor could the authors of this fact be di&s;covered, notwith&s;tanding a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, offering im|punity and a reward for the informer; yet, in con&s;equence of a clau&s;e therein, inviting any per&s;on of what condition &s;oever to di&s;cover any former &s;acrileges, &s;ome &s;ervants and &s;laves depo&s;ed, that a long time before, certain young men, heated by wine, had ridiculed &s;ome religi|ous my&s;tery, and that Alcibiades was among them: his enemies caught at this, and commenced a pro&s;ecution again&s;t him, to which Alcibiades offered to an&s;wer, a&s;&s;erting his innocence, and prote&s;ting again&s;t accu|&s;ations brought again&s;t him while he &s;hould be ab&s;ent. His enemies, determined to attempt his de&s;truction, procured others to move that he &s;hould have liberty to depart on his command, and that, after his re|turn, a day of trial &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned him; to this propo&s;ition he was unwillingly obliged to con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The fleet &s;ailed; but they had not been long in Sicily, before orders from Athens arrived, directing Alcibiades to return and take his trial; the whole city being in a confu&s;ion on the old affair of defacing the Hermae. This was a &s;tate trick played by the enemies of Alcibiades, to ruin his mighty intere&s;t, which his birth, fortune, and accompli&s;hments had gained him in Athens: to effect their purpo&s;e, they al&s;o reported that he had entered into a con&s;piracy to betray the city to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">acede|monians, and that he had per&s;uaded the Argives to undertake &s;omething to their prejudice. It was therefore determined to put him to death on
<PB N="100" REF="115">
his return; but it being apprehended, that the attempt to arre&s;t him in fight of the army might produce great commotions, tho&s;e who were &s;ent to bring him home, were ordered to treat him with great decency, and not to di&s;cover by any means the &s;evere re&s;olution taken again&s;t him. They executed their commi&s;&s;ion very exactly, &s;o that neither he nor his army, who were likewi&s;e accu&s;ed, had any &s;u&s;picion: but, in the cour&s;e of the voyage, gathering from the &s;eamen &s;omething of what was in|tended, and being informed that a per&s;on, out of fear of death, had acknowledged him&s;elf guilty, and impeached them, they wi&s;ely deter|mined not to tru&s;t an enraged and &s;uper&s;titious multitude, but to pro|vide for their own &s;afety by withdrawing as &s;oon as they had an oppor|tunity: this offered quickly after; they gave their convoy the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ip, and retired to &s;uch parts of Greece as, out of hatred to Athens, were mo&s;t likely to give them &s;helter.</P>
<P>Alcibiades went to Sparta, where he was well received. In the &s;pring, when Agis King of Sparta invaded Attica, he gave him advice to &s;eize and fortify Dicelea. This was a &s;evere &s;troke on the Athenians; but their misfortunes fell much heavier on them in Sicily, and their allies began to waver. They afterwards had &s;ome &s;light &s;ucce&s;&s;es at &s;ea, which di&s;couraged the Peloponne&s;ians; but Alcibiades exerted his elo|quence to per&s;uade them to continue the war; he advi&s;ed them to &s;end a &s;mall fleet to Ionia, promi&s;ing to engage the cities to revolt from the Athenians, and to negociate a league between Sparta and the King of Per&s;ia, the advantages of which he pointed out to them. The Lacede|monians entering into his mea&s;ures, he pa&s;&s;ed over into Ionia, and there actually effected what he had promi&s;ed. He al&s;o found means to draw Ti&s;&s;aphernes, the King of Per&s;ia's lieutenant, into a league with them. The Spartans, however, were di&s;plea&s;ed with the terms of it, and &s;eek|ing to have them altered, the Per&s;ians likewi&s;e grew di&s;plea&s;ed. Alci|biades did not long continue in favour with the Spartans; and having debauched the wife of Agis, that prince conceived the mo&s;t inveterate hatred again&s;t him, and per&s;uaded the Lacedemonians to &s;end orders to their general in Ionia to put the Athenian to death. Alcibiades gained &s;ome intelligence of this, retired to Ti&s;&s;aphernes, and laying a&s;ide the Lacedemonian, as he had before done the Athenian, became a perfect Per&s;ian. By the politene&s;s of his addre&s;s, he gained &s;o much on Ti&s;&s;a|phernes, although a profe&s;&s;ed enemy to all Greeks, that he gave his name to his gardens of plea&s;ure, after he had &s;pent immen&s;e &s;ums in adorning them; they were afterwards called Alcibiades. When the Athenian &s;aw that Ti&s;&s;aphernes placed a confidence in him, he gave him great information re&s;pecting the affairs of Greece; told him that it was not the intere&s;t of the Per&s;ian monarch that Athens &s;hould be de&s;troyed, but
<PB N="101" REF="116">
that &s;he and Sparta &s;hould be &s;upported as rivals to each other, and that then the Greeks would never have an opportunity to turn their united arms again&s;t his ma&s;ter; but added, that if it &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary to rely on one of them, he advi&s;ed him to tru&s;t to Athens, becau&s;e &s;he would be content with the dominion of the &s;ea; but that the pride of the Spartans would always &s;timulate them to new conque&s;ts, and excite in them a de&s;ire of &s;etting the Greek cities in A&s;ia at liberty.</P>
<P>Ti&s;&s;aphernes approving of the&s;e councils, Alcibiades wrote privately to &s;ome officers of the Athenian army at Samos, intimating that he was treating with the Per&s;ian on their behalf; but would not return to his native country until the democratical form of government was aboli&s;hed. The rea&s;ons he advanced for this mea&s;ure were, that the Per&s;ian king hated a democracy, but would immediately a&s;&s;i&s;t Athens, if the govern|ment was put into the hands of a few. The&s;e fickle people, the Athe|nians, prone to novelty, di&s;&s;olved the democracy, and &s;ent deputies to treat with Alcibiades and Ti&s;&s;aphemes; and, in ca&s;e the terms offered by the Per&s;ian were rea&s;onable, they were to declare that the Athenians would ve&s;t the &s;overeignty in the hands of a few. Before the deputies arrived, Alcibiades had di&s;covered that Ti&s;&s;aphernes did not incline to keep the Athenians on any terms; therefore, he &s;et up &s;uch high terms in the name of the Per&s;ians, that the Athenians them&s;elves broke off the treaty. The democracy of Athens was, however, de&s;troyed, and a new form of government was &s;et up. This did not give general &s;atisfaction; the army at Samos declared for the democracy, and, at the reque&s;t of their general Thra&s;ybulus, recalled Alcibiades.</P>
<P>On his return, he made a mo&s;t eloquent &s;peech to the army, &s;hewing them the true &s;ource of his misfortunes, the inju&s;tice of his countrymen, and the danger attending the &s;tate. The &s;oldiers, plea&s;ed with his ha|rangue, created him general, with full power, and propo&s;ed &s;ailing im|mediately to Athens to re&s;tore the ancient form of government: Alci|biades oppo&s;ed this extravagant mea&s;ure, and told them, that &s;ince they had cho&s;en him general, he mu&s;t return to Ti&s;&s;aphernes to prepare things to make a &s;peedy end of the war: accordingly, with the con&s;ent of the army, he departed. When he came to Ti&s;&s;aphernes, he extolled the great power of the Athenians; and, by this means, made him&s;elf formi|dable to the one party, and nece&s;&s;ary to the other.</P>
<P>On his return to the army, the deputies from Athens were, by his re|que&s;t, received. The army declared to them they would not acknow|ledge the pre&s;ent government, but would fail to Athens and re&s;tore the democracy: this he oppo&s;ed, and per&s;uaded them to remain where they were; and told the deputies, to return and demand of the tyrants to re|&s;ign their authority. On their return, every thing was in confu&s;ion at
<PB N="102" REF="117">
Athens; a new form of government was propo&s;ed, and Alcibiades re|called, and the favourers of an oligarchy withdrew to the enemy. Al|cibiades mean time &s;ailed with thirteen galleys to Arpendus, where he had frequent conferences with the Per&s;ian lieutenant. In his return, he took nine galleys belonging to the Peloponne&s;ian fleet: with this ad|dition to his own &s;quadron, he con&s;trained the Halicarna&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans to pay a large &s;um of money, and fortified Cos. An engagement &s;oon after took place between the Athenian and Peloponne&s;ian fleets, and, while the event was doubtful, Alcibiades came in &s;ight with twenty galleys, and &s;ecured the victory.</P>
<P>The Athenians, after this, dividing their fleet into three parts, Alci|biades, with his &s;quadron, fell in with the enemy's fleet under Minda|rus, and fled from them, till he came in fight of the other divi&s;ions, and then pur&s;ued them in his turn towards Claros, &s;inking and taking their &s;hips. When the enemy approached the &s;hore, they were joined by the Per&s;ians; a &s;econd battle en&s;ued, and a &s;econd victory was obtained. Thus, to his immortal honour, Alcibiades gained two victories in one day.</P>
<P>His fame now ro&s;e high among his countrymen; they &s;ent 1000 foot, 300 hor&s;e, and 30 galleys, to reinforce him. He &s;ailed and did good &s;ervice in the Helle&s;pont; afterwards &s;at down before Byzantium, then well fortified and defended by a Lacedemonian garri&s;on. Some of the inhabitants betrayed the city, and let in Alcibiades and his army; the garri&s;on made &s;o brave a defence, that he was on the point of being driven out; but, making a proclamation that the Byzantines &s;hould be &s;afe in their per&s;ons and effects, they joined him; the garri&s;on was al|mo&s;t all put to the &s;word.</P>
<P>Alcibiades, and his colleague Theramenes, returned in triumph to Athens; they brought with them &s;uch immen&s;e &s;poils as had not been &s;een at Athens &s;ince the Per&s;ian war. The people almo&s;t de&s;erted the city to behold Alcibiades when he landed. After he had made his ha|rangue in the a&s;&s;embly, they directed the record of his bani&s;hment to be thrown into the &s;ea, ordered him to be ab&s;olved from the cur&s;es he lay under, created him general, and conferred many other favours upon him. The &s;weetne&s;s of his temper, his complacence, and his applying the riches he brought home to the di&s;charge of taxes, made the mo&s;t virtuous of the citizens confe&s;s he de&s;erved the honours that were paid him. He did not long remain in a &s;tate of inactivity, but put to &s;ea again with a fleet of one hundred &s;hips for the Helle&s;pont, to a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;ome cities which &s;till kept firm to the Athenians: he left part of his fleet under Antiochus, with &s;trict orders not to engage; but the latter di&s;re|garded his in&s;tructions, and was defeated. On this news, Alcibiades re|turned;
<PB N="103" REF="118">
but met with another &s;troke of ill fortune; for his enemies had found means to per&s;uade the Athenians that the defeat was owing to his inattention, and that he held a corre&s;pondence with the Lacedemonians; they in&s;tantly deprived him of his command, and appointed ten new ge|nerals. To Conon, one of the ten, he delivered the fleet; but refu&s;ed to return to Athens, and in his own &s;hip pa&s;&s;ed into Thrace, built a ca&s;tle there for his own &s;ecurity, and founded a little principality in the &s;ight of his many and powerful enemies.</P>
<P>Alcibiades, though an exile, endeavoured to re&s;tore the power of his country; of which the Spartans having intelligence, procured him to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. He was a man of admirable accompli&s;hments, but indif|ferently principled; of great parts; and of an amazing ver&s;atility of genius.</P>

<P>BISHOP of Roche&s;ter, Worce&s;ter, and Ely &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the latter end of the fifteenth century, was born at Beverly in York&s;hire, and educated at the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, where he took the degree of doctor of laws. In the year 1460, he was collated to the church of St. Margaret's, New Fi&s;h-&s;treet; and, in the &s;ame year, was advanced to the deanery of St. Stephen's college, We&s;tmin&s;ter. He was appointed ma&s;ter of the rolls in 1462. Six years after, he obtained two prebends, one in the church of Sarum, the other in that of St. Paul's, London. In 1470, he was made a privy coun&s;ellor, and one of the amba&s;&s;adors to the King of Ca&s;tile; and, the next year, was among the commi&s;&s;ion|ers who treated with the commi&s;&s;ioners of the King of Scotland. About the &s;ame time he was appointed, by Edward the Fourth, to be of the privy council to his &s;on Edward Prince of Wales. In 1471, he was promoted to the bi&s;hoprick of Roche&s;ter; and, in 1472, con&s;tituted lord high chancellor of England, which great po&s;t he did not hold longer than ten months. In 1476, he was tran&s;lated to the &s;ee of Wor|ce&s;ter, and appointed lord pre&s;ident of Wales. While he was bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, he greatly enlarged the collegiate church of We&s;tbury. The Protector, Richard Duke of York, removed him from his office of preceptor to Edward the Fifth, on account of his having incurred his di&s;plea&s;ure, by his &s;trong attachment to the prince. Soon after the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Henry the Seventh to the throne, he again held the great &s;eal for a &s;hort time. In 1486, he was rai&s;ed to the bi&s;hoprick of Ely, in the room of Dr. John Morton, tran&s;lated to Canterbury. In 1488, he preached a &s;ermon in St. Mary's church, at Cambridge, which la&s;ted from one o'clock in the afternoon till pa&s;t three. He was a prelate of great learning and piety, a con&s;iderable writer, and an excellent archi|tect;
<PB N="104" REF="119">
which accounts for his being made comptroller of the royal works and buildings under Henry the Seventh. He founded a &s;chool at King|&s;ton upon Hull, and a chapel on the &s;outh &s;ide of the church in which his parents were buried. He built the beautiful and &s;pacious hall be|longing to the epi&s;copal palace at Ely, and made great improvements in all his other palaces. La&s;tly, he founded Je&s;us college in Cambridge, for a ma&s;ter, &s;ix fellows, and as many &s;cholars. This prelate wrote &s;everal works, which have been publi&s;hed. He died the fir&s;t of Octo|ber, 1500, at his ca&s;tle of Wi&s;bich; and was buried in the middle of an elegant chapel, which he had built for him&s;elf, at the ea&s;t end of the north i&s;le of the pre&s;bytery of his cathedral church.</P>

<HEAD>ALCRED, ALCREDUS, OR ALREDUS,</HEAD>
<P>KING of Northumberland, was lineally de&s;cended from the King of Bernicia, and was born about the year 740. When he attained to man's e&s;tate, he found his country mi&s;erably di&s;tracted, partly by the vices of the kings, and partly through the madne&s;s of the people. O&s;ulph, who was the lawful heir to the kingdom of Northumberland, peri&s;hed by a con&s;piracy of his own family in 758. To him &s;ucceeded Aethelwold, otherwi&s;e called Moll, by a popular election. This di&s;|plea&s;ed many of the great lords, who under the command of O&s;|win took arms again&s;t him; but with little &s;ucce&s;s, their army being routed, and O&s;win &s;lain. Alcred then a&s;&s;erted his right to the throne, in which he proved &s;ucce&s;sful. Aethelwold had reigned &s;ix years.</P>
<P>Alcred, &s;oon after his acce&s;&s;ion, married O&s;gerna: he took pains to live on good terms with his neighbours, but was far from plea&s;ing his &s;ubjects; for, in 774, they compelled him to fly from York with a &s;mall number of attendants. He retired to the &s;trong city of Bebba, thought to be the town now called Bamborrough in Northumberland: and thinking him&s;elf not &s;afe here, he &s;ought protection of Cynoth king of the Picts, who treated him kindly. The hi&s;torians affirm, that Al|cred was depo&s;ed by the unanimous con&s;ent of all the princes of the royal family, and other great lords of the kingdom. This circum&s;tance led the earl of Stamford, who was lord lieutenant of the county of Leice&s;ter in 1691, to introduce into a &s;peech he made at Leice&s;ter, to prove the legality of the Revolution, the right the people of this country had to expel a king for mal-admini&s;tration.

<HEAD>ALCUINUS (FLACCUS),</HEAD>
<P>AN eccle&s;ia&s;tic of the eighth century. Born, according to the mo&s;t probable opinion, in York&s;hire. It is pretty certain he was educated at York, under the direction of archbi&s;hop Egbert, as we learn from his own letters, in which he frequently calls that great prelate his beloved ma&s;ter, and the clergy of York the companions of his youthful &s;tudies. As he &s;urvived venerable Bede about 70 years, it is hardly po&s;&s;ible that he could have received any part of his education under him, as &s;ome writers of literary hi&s;tory have affirmed; and it is worthy of ob&s;erva|tion, that he never calls that great man his ma&s;ter, though he &s;peaks of him with the highe&s;t veneration. It is not well known to what prefer|ments he had attained in the church before he left England, though &s;ome &s;ay he was abbot of Canterbury. The occa&s;ion of his leaving his na|tive country, was by his being &s;ent on an emba&s;&s;y by Offa king of Mercia to the emperor Charlemagne; who contracted &s;o great an e&s;teem and friend&s;hip for him, that he earne&s;tly &s;olicited, and at length prevailed upon him, to &s;ettle in his court, and become his preceptor in the &s;ciences. Alcuinus accordingly in&s;tructed that great prince in rhetoric, logic, mathematics, and divinity; which rendered him one of his greate&s;t fa|vourites. "He was treated with &s;o much kindne&s;s and familiarity (&s;ays a cotemporary writer) by the emperor, that the other courtiers called him, by way of eminence, <HI>the emperor's delight.</HI>" Charlemagne em|ployed his learned favourite to write &s;everal books again&s;t the heretical opinions of Felix bi&s;hop of Urgil in Catalonia, and to defend the ortho|dox faith again&s;t that here&s;iarch, in the council of Francfort, A. D. 894; which he performed to the entire &s;atisfaction of the emperor and council, and even to the conviction of Felix and his followers, who abandoned their errors. The emperor con&s;ulted chiefly with Alcuinus on all things relating to religion and learning; and, by his advice, did many great things for the advancement of both. An academy was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the imperial palace, over which Alcuinus pre&s;ided, and in which the princes and prime nobility were educated; and other acade|mies were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the chief towns of Italy and France, at his in&s;ti|gation, and under his in&s;pection. "France (&s;ays one of our be&s;t writers of literary hi&s;tory) is indebted to Alcuinus for all the polite learning it boa&s;ted of in that and the following ages. The univer&s;ities of Paris, Tours, Fulden, Soi&s;&s;ons, and many others, owe to him their origin and increa&s;e; tho&s;e of whom he was not the &s;uperior and founder, being at lea&s;t enlightened by his doctrine and example, and enriched by the bene|fits he procured for them from Charlemagne." After Alcuinus had &s;pent many years in the mo&s;t intimate familiarity with the greate&s;t prince of his age, he at length, with great difficulty, obtained leave to retire from
<PB N="106" REF="121">
court to his abbey of St. Martin at Tours. Here he kept up a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence by letters with Charlemagne; from which it appears, that both the emperor and his learned friend were animated with the mo&s;t ardent love to learning and religion, and con&s;tantly employed in contriving and executing the noble&s;t de&s;igns for their advancement. He compo&s;ed many treati&s;es on a great variety of &s;ubjects, in a &s;tyle much &s;uperior in purity and elegance to that of the generality of writers in the age in which he flouri&s;hed. Charlemagne often &s;olicited him, with all the warmth of an affectionate friend, to return to court, and favour him with his company and advice; but he &s;till excu&s;ed him&s;elf; and nothing could draw him from his retirement in the abbey of St. Martin at Tours, where he died A. D. 804. His works were collected and publi&s;hed by Andrew du Che&s;ne in one volume folio, Paris, 1617. They con&s;i&s;t of, 1. Tracts upon &s;cripture. 2. Tracts upon doctrine, di&s;cipline, and morality. 3. Hi&s;torical treati&s;es, letters, and poems. Since that edi|tion, there has been publi&s;hed an incredible number of tracts, poems, &amp;c. a&s;cribed to this author, mo&s;t of which, in all probability, were not his.</P>

<P>A LEARNED Italian, who flouri&s;hed in the &s;ixteenth century. He was well ver&s;ed in the Greek and Latin tongues, and wrote &s;ome pieces of eloquence which met with great approbation. He was corrector of the pre&s;s a con&s;iderable time for Aldus Manutius, and is intitled to a &s;hare in the prai&s;es given to the editions of that learned printer. He publi&s;hed a treati&s;e concerning bani&s;hment, which contained &s;o many fine pa&s;&s;ages intermixed with others quite the rever&s;e, that it was thought he had tacked to &s;omewhat of his own, &s;everal fragments of a treati&s;e of <HI>Cicero de Gloria;</HI> and that afterwards, in order to &s;ave him&s;elf from being detected in this theft, he burnt the manu&s;cript of Cicero, the only one extant. Paulus Manutius, in his commentary upon the&s;e words of Cicero <HI>Librum tibi celeriter mittam de Gloria,</HI> " I will &s;peedily &s;end you my treati&s;e on Glory;" has the following pa&s;&s;age relating to the affair: "He means, &s;ays he, his two books on Glory, which were handed down to the age of our fathers for Bernard Ju&s;tinian, in the index of his books, men|tions <HI>Cicero de Gloria.</HI> This treati&s;e, however, when Bernard had left his whole library to a nunnery, could not be found, though &s;ought after with great care: nobody doubted but Peter Alcyonius, who, being phy|&s;ician to the nunnery, was intru&s;ted with the library, had ba&s;ely &s;tole it. And truly, in his treati&s;e of Bani&s;hment, &s;ome things are found inter|&s;per&s;ed here and there, which &s;eem not to favour of Alcyonius, but of &s;ome higher author." The two orations he made after the taking of Rome, wherein he repre&s;ented very &s;trongly the inju&s;tice of Charles V. and the barbarity of his &s;oldiers, were excellent pieces.

<HEAD>ALDHELM (SAINT),</HEAD>
<P>BISHOP of Shereburn in the time of the Saxon heptarchy. He is &s;aid to have been the &s;on of Kenred, brother to Ina, king of the We&s;t Saxons; but, in the opinion of William of Malm&s;bury, his father was no more than a di&s;tant relation to the king. Having received the fir&s;t part of his education in the &s;chool which one Macduff, a learned Scot, had &s;et up in the place where Malm&s;bury now &s;tands, he travelled into France and Italy for his improvement. At his return home, he &s;tudied for &s;ome time under Adrian, abbot of St. Augu&s;tine's in Canterbury, the mo&s;t learned profe&s;&s;or of the &s;ciences who had ever been in England. In the&s;e different &s;eminaries he acquired an uncommon &s;tock of know|ledge; and became famous for his learning, not only in England, but in foreign countries: whence &s;everal learned men &s;ent him their writings for his peru&s;al and correction; particularly Prince Arcivil, a &s;on of the king of Scotland, who wrote many pieces, which he &s;ent to Aldhelm, "intreating him to give them the la&s;t poli&s;h, by rubbing off their Scots ru&s;t." He was the fir&s;t Engli&s;hman who wrote in the Latin language both in pro&s;e and ver&s;e, and compo&s;ed a book for the in&s;truction of his countrymen in the pro&s;ody of that language. Be&s;ides this, he wrote &s;e|veral other treati&s;es on various &s;ubjects; &s;ome of which are lo&s;t, and others publi&s;hed by Martin Delrio and Cani&s;ius. Venerable Bede, who flouri&s;hed in the end of this and the beginning of the next century, gives the following character of Aldhelm: "He was a man of univer&s;al eru|dition, having an elegant &s;tyle, and being wonderfully well acquainted with books, both on philo&s;ophical and religious &s;ubjects." In fact, con|&s;idering the cloud of ignorance by which he was &s;urrounded, and the great difficulty of obtaining knowledge without proper in&s;truction, Ald|helm was a very extraordinary man. From one of his letters to Hedda bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, concerning the nature of his &s;tudies whil&s;t at Canterbury, he appears to have been indefatigably determined to ac|quire every &s;pecies of learning in his power. For a copy of this curi|ous epi&s;tle, &s;ee Henry's Hi&s;tory, vol. ii. p. 320. King Alfred the Great declared, that Aldhelm was the be&s;t of all the Saxon poets; and that a favourite &s;ong, which was univer&s;ally &s;ung in his time, near 200 years after its author's death, was of his compo&s;ition. When he was abbot of Malm&s;bury, having a fine voice, and great &s;kill in mu&s;ic as well as poetry, and ob&s;erving the backwardne&s;s of his barbarous countrymen to li&s;ten to grave in&s;tructions, he compo&s;ed a number of little poems, which he &s;ung to them after ma&s;s in the &s;weete&s;t manner; by which they were gradually in&s;tructed and civilized. After this excellent per&s;on had governed the mona&s;tery of Malm&s;bury, of which he was the founder,

<HEAD>ALDRED,</HEAD>
<P>ABBOT of Tavi&s;tock, was promoted to the bi&s;hopric of Worce&s;ter in the year 1046. He was &s;o much in favour with King Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, and had &s;o much power over his mind, that he obliged him to be reconciled with the wor&s;t of his enemies, particularly with Swane &s;on of the Earl Goodwin, who had revolted again&s;t him, and came with an army to invade the kingdom. Aldred al&s;o re&s;tored the union and friend&s;hip between King Edward and Griffin King of Wales. He took afterwards a journey to Rome; and being returned into England, in the year 1054, he was &s;ent amba&s;&s;ador to the Emperor Henry II.: he &s;taid a whole year in Germany, and was very honourably entertained by Herman archbi&s;hop of Cologn, from whom he learned many things re|lative to eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, which on his return he e&s;tabli&s;hed in his own dioce&s;s. In the year 1058, he went to Jeru&s;alem, which no archbi&s;hop or bi&s;hop of England had ever done before him. Two years after, he returned to England; and Kin&s;ius archbi&s;hop of York dying the 22d of December, 1060, Aldred was elected in his &s;tead on Chri&s;tmas day following, and thought fit to keep his bi&s;hopric of Worce&s;ter with the archbi&s;hopric of Canterbury, as &s;ome of his predece&s;&s;ors had done. Aldred went &s;oon after to Rome, in order to receive the pallium from the pope: he was attended by To&s;ton Earl of Northumberland, Gi&s;o bi&s;hop of Wells, and Walter bi&s;hop of Hereford. The pope received To&s;ton very honourably, and made him &s;it by him in the &s;ynod which he held again&s;t the &s;imoni&s;ts. He granted to Gi&s;o and Walter their re|que&s;t, becau&s;e they were tolerably well learned, and not accu&s;ed of &s;imony. But Aldred being by his an&s;wers found ignorant, and guilty of &s;imony, the pope deprived him very &s;everely of all honours and dig|nities; &s;o that he was obliged to return without the pallium. On his way home, he and his fellow-travellers were attacked by &s;ome robbers, who took from them all that they had, though they did not offer to kill them. This obliged them to return to Rome; and the pope, either out
<PB REF="124">
of compa&s;&s;ion, or by the threatenings of the Earl of Northumberland, gave Aldred the pallium; but he was obliged to re&s;ign his bi&s;hopric of Worce&s;ter. However, as the archbi&s;hop of York had been almo&s;t entirely ruined by the many inva&s;ions of foreigners, King Edward gave the new archbi&s;hop leave to keep twelve villages or manors which be|longed to the bi&s;hoprick of Worce&s;ter. Edward the Confe&s;&s;or dying in 1066, Aldred crowned Harold his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. He al&s;o crowned William the Conqueror, after he had made him take the following oath, viz. That he would protect the holy church of God and its leaders: that he would e&s;tabli&s;h and ob&s;erve righteous laws: that he would entirely prohibit and &s;uppre&s;s all rapines and unju&s;t judgments. He was &s;o much in favour with the Conqueror, that this prince looked upon him as a father; and, though imperious in regard to every body el&s;e, he yet &s;ub|mitted to obey this archbi&s;hop; John Bromton gives us an in&s;tance of the king's &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which at the &s;ame time &s;hows the prelate's haugh|tine&s;s. It happened one day, as the archbi&s;hop was at York, that the deputy-governor or lord-lieutenant going out of the city with a great number of people, met the archbi&s;hop's &s;ervants, who came to town with &s;everal carts and hor&s;es loaded with provi&s;ions. The governor a&s;ked to whom they belonged; and they having an&s;wered they were Aldred's &s;ervants, the governor ordered that all the&s;e provi&s;ions &s;hould be carried to the king's &s;tore-hou&s;e. The archbi&s;hop &s;ent immediately &s;ome of his clergy to the governor, commanding him to deliver the provi&s;ions, and to make &s;atisfaction to St. Peter, and to him the &s;aint's vicar, for the injury he had done them; adding, that if he refu&s;ed to comply, the archbi&s;hop would make u&s;e of his apo&s;tolic authority again&s;t him, (inti|mating thereby that he would excommunicate him). The governor, offended at this proud me&s;&s;age, u&s;ed the per&s;ons whom the archbi&s;hop had &s;ent him very ill, and returned an an&s;wer as haughty as the me&s;&s;age was. Aldred thereupon went to London to make his complaint to the king; but in this very complaint he acted with his wonted in&s;olence; for meeting the king in the church of St. Peter at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he &s;poke to him in the&s;e words: "Hearken, O William: when thou wa&s;t but a foreigner, and God, to puni&s;h the &s;ins of this nation, permitted thee to become ma&s;ter of it, after having &s;hed a great deal of blood, I con&s;e|crated thee, and put the crown upon thy head with ble&s;&s;ings; but now, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t de&s;erved it, I pronounce a cur&s;e over thee, in&s;tead of a ble&s;&s;ing, &s;ince thou art become the per&s;ecutor of God's church, and of his mini&s;ters, and ha&s;t broken the promi&s;es and oaths which thou made&s;t to me before St. Peter's altar." The king terrified at this di&s;|cour&s;e, fell upon his knees, and humbly begged the prelate to tell him, by what crime he had de&s;erved &s;o &s;evere a &s;entence. The noblemen, who were pre&s;ent, were enraged again&s;t the archbi&s;hop, and loudly cried
<PB REF="125">
out he de&s;erved death, or at lea&s;t bani&s;hment, for having offered &s;uch an injury to his &s;overeign, and they pre&s;&s;ed him with threatenings to rai&s;e the king from the ground. But the prelate, unmoved at all this, an|&s;wered calmly, "Good men, let him lie there, for he is not at Aldred's but at St. Peter's feet; let him feel St. Peter's power, &s;ince he dared to injure his vicegerent." Having thus reproved the nobles by his epi&s;|copal authority, he vouch&s;afed to take the king by the hand, and to tell him the ground of his complaint. The king humbly excu&s;ed him&s;elf, by &s;aying he had been ignorant of the whole matter; and begged of the noblemen to intreat the prelate, that he might take off the cur&s;e he had pronounced, and to change it into a ble&s;&s;ing. Aldred was at la&s;t pre|vailed upon to favour the king thus far; but not without the promi&s;e of &s;everal pre&s;ents and favours, and only after the king had granted him to take &s;uch a revenge on the governor as he thought fit. Since that time (adds the hi&s;torian) none of the noblemen ever dared to offer the lea&s;t injury. It may be que&s;tioned, which was more &s;urpri&s;ing here, whether the archbi&s;hop's haughtine&s;s, who dared to treat his &s;overeign after &s;o unbecoming a manner; or the king's &s;tupidity, who &s;uffered &s;uch in&s;olence and audaciou&s;ne&s;s from a prie&s;t?&mdash;The Danes having made an inva&s;ion in the north of England in the year 1068, under the command of Harold and Canute the &s;ons of King Swane, Aldred was &s;o much afflicted at it, that he died of grief in the 11th of September in that &s;ame year, having be&s;ought God that he might not &s;ee the de&s;olation of his church and country.</P>

Be&s;ides his preferments, above mentioned, Dr. Aldrich was al&s;o rector of Wem in Shrop&s;hire. He was cho&s;en prolocutor of the convocation in 1702.

As to his character, he was a mo&s;t univer&s;al &s;cholar, and had a ta&s;te for all &s;orts of learning, e&s;pecially architecture. Sir John Hawkins has favoured the public with &s;everal particulars relative to Dr. Aldrich's &s;kill in mu&s;ic; and, on account of the doctor's eminence in this re&s;pect, Sir John hath given his life, with his head prefixed.

By the happy talent which Dr. Aldrich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of naturalizing the compo&s;i|tions of the old Italian ma&s;ters, and accommodating them to an Engli&s;h ear, he increa&s;ed the &s;tores of our own church. Though the doctor chiefly applied him&s;elf to the cultivation of &s;acred mu&s;ic, yet, being a man of humour, he could divert him&s;elf by producing pieces of a lighter kind. There are two catches of his; the one, "Hark, the bonny Chri&s;t-church Bells;" the other intitled, "a Smoking Catch," to be &s;ung by four men &s;moking their pipes, which is not more difficult to &s;ing than diverting to hear. His love of &s;moking was, it &s;eems, &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to be an entertaining topick of di&s;cour&s;e in the univer&s;ity. Such was Dr. Aldrich's regard for the advancement of mu&s;ic, and the honour of its profe&s;&s;ors, that he had formed a de&s;ign of writing a hi&s;tory of the &s;cience; and the materials from which he propo&s;ed to compile it are yet extant in the library of his own college. It appears from the&s;e ma|terials, that he had marked down every thing he had met with con|cerning mu&s;ic and mu&s;icians; but that he had wrought no part of them into any kind of form.</P>
<P>Dr. Aldrich is of &s;ome note as a Latin poet. In the <HI>Mu&s;ae Anglica|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ae,</HI> we find two elegant copies of ver&s;es by him; one on the acce&s;&s;ion of King William III. and the other on the death of the Duke of Glou|ce&s;ter.</P>
<P>He was a man of a very chearful and plea&s;ant turn of mind. In|deed, he is always &s;poken of as having been a man of wit; and as one who, to his great talents and virtues, joined tho&s;e amiable qualities, which rendered him the object of general affection, as well as of general

<HEAD>ALEMBERT (JOHN LE ROND D'),</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent French philo&s;opher, was born at Paris in 1717, He derived the name of John le Rond from that of the church near which, after his birth, he was expo&s;ed as a foundling. His father, informed of this circum&s;tance, li&s;tened to the voice of nature and duty, took mea|&s;ures for the proper education of his child, and for his future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in a &s;tate of ea&s;e and independence.</P>
<P>He received his fir&s;t education in the college of the Four Nations, among the Jan&s;eni&s;ts, where he gave early marks of capacity and genius. In the fir&s;t year of his philo&s;ophical &s;tudies, he compo&s;ed a commentary on the epi&s;tle of St. Paul to the Romans. The Jan&s;eni&s;ts con&s;idered this production as an omen that portended to the party of Port-Royal a re&s;toration to &s;ome part of their ancient &s;plendor, and hoped to find one day in M. d'Alembert a &s;econd Pa&s;cal. To render this re&s;emblance more complete, they engaged their ri&s;ing pupil in the &s;tudy of mathe|matics; but they &s;oon perceived that his growing attachment to this &s;cience was likely to di&s;appoint the hopes they had formed with re&s;pect to his future de&s;tination: they, therefore, endeavoured to divert him from this line; but their endeavours were fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>At his leaving the college, he found him&s;elf alone and unconnected in the world; and &s;ought an a&s;ylum in the hou&s;e of his <HI>nur&s;e.</HI> He comforted him&s;elf with the hope, that his fortune, though not ample, would better the condition and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of that family, which was the only one that he could con&s;ider as his own: here, therefore, he took up his re&s;idence, re&s;olving to apply him&s;elf entirely to the &s;tudy of goe|metry. And here he lived, during the &s;pace of forty years, with the greate&s;t &s;implicity, di&s;covering the augmentation of his means only by increa&s;ing di&s;plays of his beneficence, concealing his growing reputation and celebrity from the&s;e hone&s;t people, and making their plain and un|couth manners the &s;ubject of good-natured plea&s;antry and philo&s;ophical ob&s;ervation. His good nur&s;e perceived his ardent activity; heard him mentioned as the writer of many books; but never took it into her head that he was a great man, and rather beheld him with a kind of compa&s;|&s;ion. "<HI>You will never,</HI>" &s;aid &s;he to him one day, "<HI>be any thing but a philo&s;opher&mdash;and what is a philo&s;opher?&mdash;a fool, who toils and plagues him&s;elf during his life, that people may talk of him when</HI> HE IS NO MORE."</P>
<P>As M. d'Alembert's fortune did not far exceed the demands of nece&s;|&s;ity, his friends advi&s;ed him to think of a profe&s;&s;ion that might enable him to augment it. He accordingly turned his views to the law, and took his degrees in that line; but &s;oon abandoned this plan, and applied to the &s;tudy of medicine. Geometry, however, was always drawing
<PB N="114" REF="129">
him back to his former pur&s;uits, and after many ineffectual efforts to re&s;i&s;t its attractions, he renounced all views of a lucrative profe&s;&s;ion, and gave him&s;elf over entirely to mathematics and poverty.</P>
<P>In the year 1741, he was admitted member of the academy of &s;ci|ences; for which di&s;tingui&s;hed literary promotion, at &s;uch an early age, he had prepared the way by correcting the errors of a celebrated work, which was deemed <HI>cla&s;&s;ical</HI> in France in the line of geometry. He af|terwards &s;et him&s;elf to examine, with deep attention and a&s;&s;iduity, what mu&s;t be the motion of a body which pa&s;&s;es from one fluid into another more den&s;e, in a direction not perpendicular to the &s;urface &s;eparating the two fluids. Every one knows the phenomenon which happens in this ca&s;e, and which amu&s;es children under the denomination of <HI>duck<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and drakes</HI>; but M. d'Alembert was the fir&s;t who explained it in a &s;atis|factory and philo&s;ophical manner.</P>
<P>Two years after his election to a place in the academy, he publi&s;hed his <HI>Treati&s;e on Dynamics.</HI> The new principle developed in this treati&s;e con&s;i&s;ted in e&s;tabli&s;hing equality, at each in&s;tant, between the changes that the motion of a body has undergone, and the forces or powers which have been employed to produce them; or to expre&s;s them other|wi&s;e, in &s;eparating into <HI>two parts</HI> the action of the moving powers, and con&s;idering the <HI>one</HI> as producing alone the motion of the body, in the &s;econd in&s;tant, and the <HI>other</HI> as employed to de&s;troy that which it had in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>So early as the year 1744, M. d'Alembert had applied this principle to the theory of the equilibrium, and the motion of fluids; and all the problems before &s;olved by geometricians became, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, in corollaries. The di&s;covery of this new principle was followed by that of a new calculus, the fir&s;t trials of which were publi&s;hed in a <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e on the general Theory of the Winds,</HI> to which the prize-medal was adjudged by the academy of Berlin in the year 1746, and which was a new and brilliant addition to the fame of M. d'Alembert. This new calculus of partial differences he applied, the year following, to the problem of vi|brating chords, who&s;e &s;olution, as well as the theory of the o&s;cillation of the air and the propagation of &s;ound, had been given but incom|pletely by the geometricians who preceded him, and the&s;e were hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ma&s;ters or his rivals.</P>
<P>In the year 1749, he furni&s;hed a method of applying his principle a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the motion of any body of a given figure; and he &s;olved the problem o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the prece&s;&s;ion of the equinoxes, determined its <HI>quantity,</HI> and explaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the phenomenon of the nutation of the terre&s;trial axis di&s;covered by D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bradley.</P>
<P>In 1752, M. d'Alembert publi&s;hed a treati&s;e on the <HI>Re&s;i&s;tance of Fluid</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="130">
to which he gave the mode&s;t title of an <HI>E&s;&s;ay;</HI> but which contains a multitude of original ideas and new ob&s;ervations. About the &s;ame time, he publi&s;hed, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, <HI>Re&s;earches con|cerning the Integral Calculus,</HI> which is greatly indebted to him for the ra|pid progre&s;s it has made in the pre&s;ent century.</P>
<P>While the &s;tudies of M. d'Alembert were confined to goemetry, he was little known or celebrated in his native country. His connections were limited to a &s;mall &s;ociety of &s;elect friends: he had never &s;een any man in high office except Me&s;&s;rs d'Argen&s;on. Satisfied with an income which furni&s;hed him with the nece&s;&s;aries of life, he did not a&s;pire after opulence or honours, nor had they been hitherto be&s;towed upon him, as it is ea&s;ier to confer them on tho&s;e who &s;olicit them, than to look out for men who de&s;erve them. His chearful conver&s;ation, his &s;mart and lively &s;allies, a happy knack at telling a &s;tory, a &s;ingular mixture of malice of &s;peech with goodne&s;s of heart, and of delicacy of wit with &s;implicity of manners, rendered him a plea&s;ing and intere&s;ting compa|nion, and his company con&s;equently was much &s;ought after in the fa&s;hionable circles. His reputation, at length, made its way to the throne, and rendered him the object of royal attention and beneficence. He received al&s;o a pen&s;ion from government, which he owed to the friend&s;hip of Count d'Argen&s;on.</P>
<P>The tranquillity of M. d'Alembert was abated when his fame grew more exten&s;ive, and when it was known beyond the circle of his friends, that a fine and enlightened genius for literature and philo&s;ophy accom|panied his mathematical genius. Our author's eulogi&s;t a&s;cribes to envy, detraction, and to other motives nearly as ungenerous, all the di&s;appro|bation, oppo&s;ition, and cen&s;ure that M. d'Alembert met with on account of the publication of the famous Encyclopedical Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with Diderot. None &s;urely will refu&s;e the ju&s;t tribute of applau&s;e to the eminent di&s;plays of genius, judgment, and true literary ta&s;te, with which M. d'Alembert has enriched the great work now mentioned. Among others, the Preliminary Di&s;cour&s;e he has af|fixed to it, concerning the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, connections, and affinities of all the branches of human knowledge, is perhaps one of the mo&s;t capital productions of which the philo&s;ophy of the pre&s;ent age can boa&s;t. Nor will it be di&s;puted, that the ma&s;ter-builders of this new and &s;tupendous temple of &s;cience, for the wor&s;hip of Nature, had al&s;o really in view the advancement of human knowledge, and the improvement of the arts and &s;ciences. This, no true, no candid philo&s;opher, will call in que&s;tion. But that in the <HI>inner court</HI> of this temple there was a confederacy formed again&s;t all tho&s;e who looked higher than <HI>nature,</HI> for the principal object
<PB N="116" REF="131">
of their veneration and confidence, is a fact too palpable, nay too boldly avowed, to &s;tand in need of any proof.</P>
<P>Some time after this, d'Alembert publi&s;hed his Philo&s;ophical, Hi&s;to|rical, and Philological Mi&s;cellanies: the&s;e were followed by the Me|moirs of Chri&s;tina Queen of Sweden; in which M. d'Alembert &s;howed that he was acquainted with the natural rights of mankind, and was bold enough to a&s;&s;ert them. His <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Intercour&s;e of Men of Let|ters with Per&s;ons high in Rank and Office,</HI> wounded the former to the quick, as it expo&s;ed to the eyes of the public the ignominy of tho&s;e &s;er|vile chains, which they feared to &s;hake off, or were proud to wear. A lady of the court hearing one day the author accu&s;ed of having exaggerated the de&s;poti&s;m of the great, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion they require, an&s;wered &s;lyly, <HI>If he had con&s;ulted me, I would have told him &s;till more of the matter.</HI></P>
<P>M. d'Alembert gave very elegant &s;pecimens of his literary abilities in his tran&s;lations of &s;ome &s;elect pieces of Tacitus. But the&s;e occupa|tions did not divert him from his mathematical &s;tudies; for about the &s;ame time he enriched the Encyclop&eacute;die with a multitude of excellent articles in that line, and compo&s;ed his <HI>Re&s;earches on &s;everal important Points of the Sy&s;tem of the World,</HI> in which he carried to a higher degree of perfection the &s;olution of the problem of the perturbations of the pla|nets, that had &s;everal years before been pre&s;ented to the academy.</P>
<P>In 1759, he publi&s;hed his <HI>Elements of Philo&s;ophy</HI>; a work extolled as remarkable for its preci&s;ion and per&s;picuity; in which, however, are &s;ome tenets relative both to metaphy&s;ics and moral &s;cience, that are far from being admi&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The re&s;entment that was kindled (and the di&s;putes that followed it) by the article <HI>Geneva,</HI> in&s;erted in the Encyclop&eacute;die, are well known. M. d'Alembert did not leave this field of controver&s;y with flying co|lours. Voltaire was an auxiliary in the conte&s;t; but as, in point of candour and decency, he had no reputation to lo&s;e; and as he weaken|ed the blows of his enemies, by throwing both them and the &s;pectator into fits of laughter, the i&s;&s;ue of the war gave him little unea&s;ine&s;s. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fell more heavily on d'Alembert; and expo&s;ed him, even at home, to much contradiction and oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It was on this occa&s;ion that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia offered him an honour+able a&s;ylum at his court, and the place of pre&s;ident of his academy; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was not offended at his refu&s;al of the&s;e di&s;tinctions, but cultivated an in+timate friend&s;hip with him during the re&s;t of his life. He had refu&s;ed &s;ome time before this, a propo&s;al made by the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia to in+tru&s;t him with the education of the Grand Duke; a propo&s;al accompa+nied with all the flattering offers that could tempt a man, ambitious o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="117" REF="132">
titles, or de&s;irous of making an ample fortune: but the objects of his ambition were tranquillity and &s;tudy.</P>
<P>In the year 1765, he publi&s;hed his <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on the De&s;truction of the Je&s;ui&s;ts.</HI> This piece drew upon him a &s;warm of adver&s;aries, who con|firmed the merit and credit of his work by their manner of attacking it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the works already mentioned, he publi&s;hed nine volumes of memoirs and treati&s;es, under the title of <HI>Opu&s;cules</HI>; in which he has &s;olved a multitude of problems relative to a&s;tronomy, mathematics, and natural philo&s;ophy; of which our panegyri&s;t gives a particular ac|count, more e&s;pecially of tho&s;e which exhibit new &s;ubjects, or new me|thods of inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>He publi&s;hed al&s;o <HI>Elements of Mu&s;ic</HI>; and rendered, at length, the &s;y&s;tem of Rameau intelligible; but he did not think the mathematical theory of the &s;onorous body &s;ufficient to account for the rules of that art. He was always fond of mu&s;ic; which, on the one hand, is con|nected with the mo&s;t &s;ubtle and learned re&s;earches of rational mecha|nics; while, on the other, its power over the &s;en&s;es and the &s;oul exhi|bits to philo&s;ophers phenomena no le&s;s &s;ingular, and &s;till more inexpli|cable.</P>
<P>In the year 1772, he was cho&s;en &s;ecretary to the French academy. He formed, &s;oon after this preferment, the de&s;ign of writing the lives of all the decea&s;ed academicians, from 1700 to 1772; and in the &s;pace three years he executed this de&s;ign, by compo&s;ing 70 eulogies.</P>
<P>M. d'Alembert died on the 29th of October, 1783. There were many amiable lines of candour, mode&s;ty, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and benefi|cence, in his moral character; which are de&s;cribed, with a diffu&s;ive de|tail, in his eulogium, by M. Condorcet, Hi&s;t. de l'Acad. Royale des Sciences, 1783.</P>

<HEAD>ALEXANDER THE GREAT,</HEAD>
<P>KING of Macedon. His father Philip laid the plan of that exten|&s;ive empire, which his &s;on afterwards executed. Philip, having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Greece, began to ca&s;t his eyes upon Per&s;ia, with a view to retaliate upon that haughty empire the injuries of former times. It was the popular topic of the day. But this prince was cut off in the mid&s;t of his enterpri&s;e. Such, however, was the influence of Alexander in the a&s;&s;embly of the Grecian &s;tates, that he was created general of their combined forces in the room of his father. Having made every needful preparation, at the head of a veteran army he invaded A&s;ia. The lieutenants of Darius, who was then king of Per&s;ia, oppo&s;ed him at the river Granicus, where Alexander obtained a complete victory, after
<PB N="118" REF="133">
which he pur&s;ued his march through A&s;ia. At I&s;&s;us, near Scanderoon, he was met by Darius in per&s;on, at the head of a prodigious army. Here he obtained a &s;econd victory; and took the camp of Darius, toge|ther with his family, whom he treated with the utmo&s;t humanity. Con|trary to all the maxims of war, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing Darius, he made an excur&s;ion into Egypt; and, as far as appears, through no better motives than tho&s;e of vanity. Here he was acknowledged to be the &s;on of Ju|piter Ammon. In the mean time Darius recruited his &s;trength, and got together an army &s;uperior to what he brought into the plain of I&s;&s;us, Alexander having fini&s;hed his Egyptian expedition, traver&s;ed A&s;ia, and pa&s;&s;ed the Euphrates. At Arbella, a town in A&s;&s;yria, he met Darius. Here a deci&s;ive battle was fought, which put all Per&s;ia into the hands of Alexander. His ambition not being &s;atisfied with the conque&s;t of that va&s;t country, he projected an expedition into India. Here he met with great oppo&s;ition from Porus, a gallant prince, whom in the end he re|duced. Beyond the Ganges lay a country &s;till un&s;ubdued. He notified it to his army, that he propo&s;ed to pa&s;s the river. But the&s;e veterans, hara&s;&s;ed with the fatigues, and &s;eeing no end of their labour, mutinied, and refu&s;ed to march further. The di&s;appointed chief was therefore obliged to return. At Babylon he propo&s;ed to receive amba&s;&s;adors, appoint governors, and &s;ettle his va&s;t monarchy; but his exce&s;&s;es put an and to his life in the mid&s;t of his de&s;igns, and in the flower of his age.</P>
<P>The character of this hero is &s;o familiar to every body, that it is al|mo&s;t needle&s;s labour to draw it. All the world knows, &s;ays Mr. Bayle, that it was equally compo&s;ed of very great virtues and very great vices. He had no mediocrity in any thing but his &s;tature: in his other proper|ties, whether good or bad, he was all extremes. His ambition ro&s;e even to madne&s;s. His father was not at all mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing the bounds of Macedon too &s;mall for his &s;on: for how could Macedon bound the ambition of a man, who reckoned the world too &s;mall a dominion? He wept at hearing the philo&s;opher Anaxarchus &s;ay, that there was an infi|nite number of worlds: his tears were owing to his de&s;pair of conquer|ing them all, &s;ince he had not yet been able to conquer one. Livy, in a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion, has attempted to inquire into the events which might have happened, if Alexander, after the conque&s;t of A&s;ia, had brought his arms into Italy? Doubtle&s;s things might have taken a very different turn with him; and all the grand projects, which &s;ucceeded &s;o well again&s;t an effeminate Per&s;ian monarch, might ea&s;ily have mi&s;carried if he had to do with rough hardy Roman armies. And yet the va&s;t aims of this mighty conqueror, if &s;een under another point of view, may ap|pear to have been confined in a very narrow compa&s;s; &s;ince, as we are told, the utmo&s;t wi&s;h of that great heart, for which the whole earth was
<PB N="119" REF="134">
not big enough, was, after all, to be prai&s;ed by the Athenians: for it is related, that the difficulties which he encountered in order to pa&s;s the Hyda&s;pes, forced him to cry out,
<Q REND="inline">"O Athenians, could you believe to what dangers I expo&s;e my&s;elf for the &s;ake of being celebrated by you?"</Q>
But Bayle affirms, that this was quite con&s;i&s;tent with the va&s;t unbounded extent of his ambition, as he wanted to make all future time his own, and be an object of admiration to the late&s;t po&s;terity; yet did not expect this from the conque&s;t of worlds, but from books.
<Q REND="inline">"He was perfectly in the right; &s;ays Bayle; "for if Greece had not fur|ni&s;hed him with good writers, he would long ago have been as much forgotten as the kings who reigned in Macedon before Amphi|tryon."</Q></P>
<P>Alexander has been prai&s;ed upon the &s;core of continency, yet his life could not &s;urely be quite regular in that re&s;pect. Indeed, the fire of his early youth appeared &s;o cold towards women, that his mother &s;u&s;pected him to be impotent; and, to &s;atisfy her&s;elf in this point, did, with the con&s;ent of Philip, procure a very hand&s;ome courtezan to lie with him, who&s;e care&s;&s;es, however, were all to no purpo&s;e. His behaviour after|wards to the Per&s;ian captives &s;hows him to have had a great command over him&s;elf in this particular. The wife of Darius was a fini&s;hed beauty; her daughters likewi&s;e were all beauties; yet this young prince, who had them in his power, not only be&s;towed on them all the honours due to their high rank, but managed their reputation with the utmo&s;t delicacy. They were kept as in a cloy&s;ter concealed from the world, and &s;ecured from the reach of every di&s;honourable (not only attack, but) imputation. He did not give the lea&s;t handle to &s;candal, either by his vi&s;its, his looks, or his words: and for other Per&s;ian dames his pri&s;oners, equally beautiful in face and &s;hape, he contented him&s;elf with &s;aying gaily, that they gave indeed much pain to his eyes. The amazon Tha|le&s;tris could not obtain from him a compliance with her gallant reque&s;t till after a delay of thirteen days. In the mean time, what are we to con|clude from his cau&s;ing his favourite mi&s;tre&s;s Panca&s;te to be drawn naked by Apelles, though it is true he gave her to the painter, who fell in love with her? What of that immoderate love of boys, which Athenaeus re|lates of him? What of that prodigious number of wives and concubines which he kept?</P>
<P>His exce&s;&s;es with regard to wine were notorious, and beyond all ima|gination; and he committed, when drunk, a thou&s;and extravagancies. It was owing to wine, that he killed Clytus who &s;aved his life, and burnt Per&s;epolis, one of the mo&s;t beautiful cities of the Ea&s;t: he did this la&s;t indeed at the in&s;tigation of the courtezan Thais; but this circum&s;tance made it only the more heinous. It is generally believed, that he died
<PB N="120" REF="135">
by drinking immoderately: and even Plutarch, who affects to contra|dict it, owns that he did nothing but drink the whole day he was taken ill.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, to &s;um up the character of this prince, we cannot be of opi|nion, that his good qualities did in any wi&s;e compen&s;ate for his bad ones. Heroes make a noi&s;e: their actions glare, and &s;trike the &s;en&s;es forcibly; while the infinite de&s;truction and mi&s;ery they occa&s;ion lies more in the &s;hade, and out of &s;ight. One good legi&s;lator is worth all the heroes that ever did or will exi&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>ALEXANDER (NOEL),</HEAD>
<P>AN indefatigable writer of the 17th century, born at Roan in Nor|mandy, 1639. After fini&s;hing his &s;tudies at Roan, he entered into the order of Dominican friars, and was profe&s;&s;ed there in 1655. Soon af|ter he went to Paris, to go through a cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy and divinity in the great convent, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf &s;o, that he was ap|pointed to teach philo&s;ophy there, which he did for twelve years. Mr. Colbert &s;howed him many marks of his e&s;teem; and being determined to omit nothing to perfect the education of his &s;on, afterwards archbi|&s;hop of Roan, he formed an a&s;&s;embly of the mo&s;t learned per&s;ons, who&s;e conferences upon eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory might be of advantage to him. Father Alexander was invited to this a&s;&s;embly, where he exerted him&s;elf with &s;o much genius and ability, that he gained the particular friend&s;hip of young Colbert, who &s;howed him the utmo&s;t regard as long as he lived. The&s;e conferences gave ri&s;e to Alexander's de&s;ign of writing an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory; for, being de&s;ired to reduce what was material in the&s;e conferences to writing, he did it with &s;o much accuracy, that the learn|ed men who compo&s;ed this a&s;&s;embly, advi&s;ed him to undertake a com|plete body of church-hi&s;tory. This he executed with great a&s;&s;iduity, collecting and dige&s;ting the materials him&s;elf, and writing even the tables with his own hand. He at la&s;t completed his work in 1686. Towards the latter part of his life, he was afflicted with the lo&s;s of his fight; a mo&s;t inexpre&s;&s;ible misfortune to one who&s;e whole plea&s;ure was in &s;tudy, yet he bore it with great patience and re&s;ignation.

<P>AN eminent &s;tate&s;man and poet of Scotland in the reigns of James I. and Charles I. His &s;urname is &s;aid to have been taken from the proper name of his predece&s;&s;or Alexander Macdonald, who, under the family of Argyle held the lands of Men&s;tris. Andrew Alexander in the reign of James V. is the fir&s;t of the name mentioned in the records of Scotland. From him our William is de&s;cended. He was born in 1580. He
<PB N="122" REF="138">
&s;oon di&s;covered con&s;picuous parts, which made his friends de&s;irous to improve them to the utmo&s;t, by a liberal education, and was &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed for both, that he was recommended as tutor, or rather companion to the Earl of Argyle. After &s;ome time &s;pent in foreign parts he returned to Scotland, and betook him&s;elf a while to a rural re|tirement. Here he fini&s;hed his poetical complaint of the un&s;ucce&s;sful addre&s;s he had made to his fir&s;t mi&s;tre&s;s, which he entitled <HI>Aurora.</HI> After his return this court&s;hip was revived, and he wrote above an hun|dred &s;onnets upon it. The lady marrying &s;oon after, he removed to the court of King James VI. and lived there in the capacity of a private gentleman, but with the character of a learned and accompli&s;hed one. Here he &s;till found occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e his poetical talents, as they re|commended him much to the King. The poetry Alexander now turned his mind to was of a more &s;ublime kind than that which he had for|merly wrote; he now held the mirror up to kings and princes, endea|voured to animate the precepts of philo&s;ophy, and to render its grave&s;t le&s;&s;ons affecting. He formed his works on the plan of the Greek and Roman tragedies. And in 1600, he publi&s;hed at Edinburgh a tragedy upon the &s;tory of Darius. In this, and in his other plays, his mea&s;ure is alternate rhyme: his &s;tyle is not always &s;ound, for which, in his pre|face he pleads his country. This was the year after reprinted at London, without the preface, but with two poems of our author's; one congratu|lating the King upon his entry into England, the other written after an inundation which happened at Dover, a place where his maje&s;ty u&s;ed to amu&s;e him&s;elf with hawking.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame year his Paraene&s;is to Prince Henry was al&s;o publi&s;hed. In this poem, he &s;hews how the happine&s;s of the prince depends on the choice of his coun&s;ellors. He &s;hews al&s;o the u&s;e of hi&s;tory, and how the lives of great men are to be read with profit. Whether our author had yet arrived in England does not appear, or whether he publi&s;hed any thing more before the year 1609 we have not learned; but in that year came out his three other plays, which, with that before-mentioned, are entitled the Monarchie Tragedies: Croe&s;us, Darius, the Alexandrian Julius Cae&s;ar; by William Alexander, gentleman of the prince's privy-chamber, and with them are bound the above-mentioned poems. They are dedicated to King James in a poem of thirteen &s;tanzas. King James is &s;aid to have been delighted with the&s;e plays, and with our author's conver&s;ation. Many authors have &s;poken highly of the&s;e tragedies.</P>
<P>Not long after, Mr. Alexander publi&s;hed a &s;upplement to Sir Philip Sidney's celebrated romance, which is to be found in the fourth, and &s;ub&s;equent editions of that work, with the initials of his name to it. This was a proper exerci&s;e for his mu&s;e. In the &s;ame year, 1613, we find him
<PB N="123" REF="139">
mentioned to have been &s;worn in one of the gentlemen u&s;hers of the pre&s;ence to Prince Charles.</P>
<P>His mu&s;e now laboured with a poem of a different kind. He brought forth a &s;acred poem, called Doom&s;day, or the Great Day of the Lord's Judgment; it was fir&s;t printed at Edinburgh, in 4to, in 1614, and afterwards in the folio edition of his works. It is divided into twelve books, or hours, as the author calls them. The fir&s;t book was repr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nted by a Mr. John&s;toun, who tells us the work had received the approbation of Mr. Addi&s;on. In the year above-mentioned, the King made him ma&s;ter of the reque&s;ts, and conferred on him the honour of knighthood.</P>
<P>From this time he commenced a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, and became ambi|tious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;pacious e&s;tate. He projected the &s;ettlement of a large c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lony in Nova Scotia, at the expence of &s;uch adventurers as &s;hould be engaged in the undertaking. His maje&s;ty made him a grant of that country, and intended to create an order of baronets for the encourage|ment and &s;upport of &s;o great a work; but the jealou&s;ies which exi&s;ted in the latter part of this reign, &s;u&s;pended the execution of it. King Charles I. on his coming to the crown, was very forward to counte|nance it; as it appeared from a pamphlet publi&s;hed by Sir William, entitled "An Encouragement to Colonies," to promi&s;e great advantages to the nation. The king made Sir William Alexander, Lieutenant of Nova Scotia, and founded in the fir&s;t year of his reign the order of Knights Baronets of Scotland, who&s;e aid was appropriated for the &s;aid plantation and &s;ettlement, upon con&s;ideration of each having a li|beral portion of land allotted him there. Their number was not to ex|ceed 150, and they were endowed with certain privileges, as that their title &s;hould be hereditary, that they &s;hould take place before all knights, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll le&s;&s;er barons, and all gentlemen, except Sir William Alexander, who, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd his heir, have an expre&s;s exemption.

<P>A MAN who has acted a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed part again&s;t the Otto|man empire in this century, was born in Natolia in 1728, and received at his birth the name of Jo&s;eph. His father was a Greek prie&s;t, of a di&s;tingui&s;hed family, who educated him with great care, de&s;igning him to &s;ucceed him: but, at thirteen years of age, Jo&s;eph being hunting in a neighbouring fore&s;t, robbers fell on his company, and carried him off to Grand Cairo: here he was &s;old to Ibrahim, a lieutenant of the jani|&s;aries, who had him circumci&s;ed, clothed him in the dre&s;s of the Ma|malukes, and called him Ali: he gave him ma&s;ters in the Turki&s;h and Arabic languages, and in hor&s;eman&s;hip; and, by kind treatment, made him by degrees &s;atisfied with his new &s;tation. In a cour&s;e of years, he &s;ucceeded in the&s;e languages, &s;hewed wonderful dexterity in the u&s;e of his arms, and became &s;o dear to his ma&s;ter, that he rai&s;ed him rapidly in his hou&s;ehold, and created him a <HI>cachef</HI> or governor, at the age of twenty-two.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="142">In this &s;tation, he manife&s;ted his equity and good admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, improved the di&s;cipline of the Mamalukes, and laid the founda|tion of his future greatne&s;s. Here he gained the favour of the pacha Rahiph, who, di&s;covering his merit, became his protector. He remain|ed &s;everal years in this &s;tation, until his patron Ibrahim was elected emir al hagi, or prince of the caravan, who took him with him to e&s;cort the pilgrims: in their march they were attacked by the Arabs; Ali fell up|on them at the head of the Mamalukes, repul&s;ed the enemy, and killed a great number on the &s;pot. On his return, &s;everal tribes being col|lected, were determined to avenge their defeat: the young cachef gave them battle, and obtained a &s;ignal victory. Ibrahim did ju&s;tice to the &s;ervices of his lieutenant in full council, and propo&s;ed to create him a &s;angiak. Ibrahim the Circa&s;&s;ian oppo&s;ed it with all his might; but the emir al hagi prevailed; Ali was nominated by the divan: the pacha con|firmed this choice, clothed him with a caftan, and gave him the firmaun of bey.</P>
<P>Become now one of the members of the republic, he never forgot his obligations to his patron. In 1758, the emir al hagi was murdered by the party of Ibrahim the Circa&s;&s;ian. From this moment, Ali meditated vengeance: he concealed his re&s;entment, and employed all the re&s;ources of his mind to arrive at the po&s;t of &s;cheik elbalad, the fir&s;t dignity of the republic. In 1763, he attained that po&s;t; and &s;oon after revenged the blood of his patron, by &s;acrificing Ibrahim the Circa&s;&s;ian with his own hand. This action rai&s;ed him up numerous enemies: the &s;angiaks, at|tached to the party of the Circa&s;&s;ian, con&s;pired again&s;t him; he was on the point of being murdered, but &s;aved him&s;elf by flight, and repaired to Jeru&s;alem. Having gained the e&s;teem of the governor of that city, he thought him&s;elf in &s;afety; but his enemies fearing him even in exile, wrote to the Porte to demand his death; and orders were immediately &s;ent to the governor to &s;trike off his head. Fortunately, Rahiph, his old friend, was one of the divan, and gave him notice to fly from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eru|&s;alem: Ali therefore anticipated the arrival of the capigi bachi, and took refuge with &s;cheik Daker, prince of St. John of Acre.</P>
<P>This re&s;pectable old man received him with open arms: he was not long in di&s;covering the merit of his new gue&s;t, and from that moment loaded him with care&s;&s;es; he exhorted him to bear adver&s;ity with cou|rage, flattered his hopes, &s;oothed his &s;orrows, and made him ta&s;te of plea&s;ures even in his di&s;grace. Ali Bey might have pa&s;&s;ed his days hap|pily with &s;cheik Daker; but ambition would not permit him to remain inactive; he carried on a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the &s;angiaks attached to his intere&s;t. The prince of Acre, on his part, wrote to his friends at Grand Cairo, and urged them to ha&s;ten the recal of the &s;cheik

elbalad. While this was going on, Rahiph, now grand vizier, pro|cured him to be invited to return to Grand Cairo, and re&s;ume his dig|nity: he &s;et off immediately, and was received with the acclamations of the people. On all &s;ides the &s;torm was gathering around him: all tho&s;e who were offended at the murder of Ibrahim the Circa&s;&s;ian were con|&s;tantly laying &s;nares for him; they only waited a favourable opportu|nity: the death of Rahiph, which happened in 1763, furni&s;hed them with it; they threw off the ma&s;k, and declared openly again&s;t him. He e&s;caped into Arabia Felix, vi&s;ited the coa&s;ts of the Red Sea, and once more took refuge with the &s;cheik of Acre, who received him with the &s;ame tenderne&s;s. Whil&s;t he was there, the &s;angiaks of the party of the Circa&s;&s;ian per&s;ecuted tho&s;e who were devoted to the intere&s;ts of Ali. This imprudence opened the eyes of the majority; they perceived that they were the dupes of a few ambitious men; and, to &s;trengthen their party, recalled the &s;cheik elbalad, and promi&s;ed to &s;upport him with all their power: he &s;et off immediately. On his return to Grand Cairo, in 1766, Ali held a council: he repre&s;ented to them that moderation had only excited the friends of Ibrahim to revenge; that nothing but flight would have &s;aved him from their plots; and that, to &s;ecure the common &s;afety, the&s;e turbulent &s;pirits mu&s;t be &s;acrificed. The whole a&s;&s;embly applauded this re&s;olution; and, the next day, they took off the heads of four of them. This execution in&s;ured the tranquillity of Ali: he &s;aw him&s;elf at the head of the government; and, in the &s;pace of &s;ix years, rai&s;ed &s;ixteen of his Mamalukes to the dignity of beys, and one of them to that of aga of the jani&s;aries.</P>
<P>Supreme chief of the republic, he adopted every mea&s;ure to render his power durable: not content with increa&s;ing his Mamalukes to &s;ix thou&s;and, he took into pay ten thou&s;and Mograbi: he cau&s;ed his troops to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t rigid di&s;cipline, and, by continual exerci&s;e, made them good &s;oldiers. He attached the young men of his hou&s;ehold to him, by the paternal attention he paid to their education, and above all by be&s;towing favours and rewards on tho&s;e who were the mo&s;t worthy. His party became &s;o powerful, that &s;uch of his colleagues as were not his friends dreaded his power, nor dared to thwart his projects. Be|lieving his authority e&s;tabli&s;hed on a &s;olid ba&s;is, he turned his attention to the welfare of his people: the Arabs, di&s;per&s;ed over the de&s;arts, and on the frontiers of Egypt, committed ravages not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctuating government: he declared war, and &s;ent again&s;t them bodies of cavalry, which beat them every where, and drove them back into the depth of their &s;olitudes. Egypt began to re&s;pire, and agriculture, encouraged, flouri&s;hed once more in that rich country. Having ren|dered the chief of each village re&s;pon&s;ible for the crimes of the inhabi|tants,
<PB N="128" REF="144">
he puni&s;hed them until the authors of the offence were delivered into the hands of ju&s;tice. In this manner, the principal citizens looked after the public &s;afety; and, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince the commencement of the Turki&s;h empire, the traveller and merchant could pa&s;s through the whole extent of the kingdom without the apprehen&s;ion of an in&s;ult.</P>
<P>The &s;cheik elbalad unfortunately accumulated favours on Mahomed Abou Dahab, a traitor, who &s;ecretly a&s;pired to the &s;overeign power. The &s;angiaks bribed him to put the &s;cheik out of the way; but fearing for his own life, he deferred it, and kept the gold: to increa&s;e the confidence of his friend, he di&s;covered the con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>In 1768, the Ru&s;&s;ians declared war again&s;t the Porte: the &s;cheik &s;ent twelve thou&s;and men to &s;erve in the Turki&s;h army. Even this circum|&s;tance of duty was made u&s;e of to his di&s;advantage; and it was repre|&s;ented at Con&s;tantinople, that the&s;e troops were de&s;igned to &s;erve in the Ru&s;&s;ian army: the calumny was credited, and a capigi, with four at|tendants, &s;ent to take off his head. Ali had intelligence by his friends, and di&s;patched a confident, with twelve Mamalukes, who &s;eized the capigi and his attendants, took from them their order, and put them to death. The whole will &s;hew us by how precarious a tenure life is held in the Ottoman empire. The &s;cheik, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this order, a&s;&s;embled the chiefs, and laid before them the de&s;poti&s;m of the Ottoman court. This had the de&s;ired effect; &s;ixteen of the beys exclaimed, that war ought to be declared again&s;t the Grand Signior. The Turki&s;h pacha was or|dered to quit Egypt: and the &s;cheik &s;ecured the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the prince of Acre.</P>
<P>Ali levied two armies; of one he gave the command to his brother Abou Dahab, to attack Arabia Felix, and the interior provinces; the other, to I&s;ma&euml;l, to attack the maritime towns: he al&s;o equipped a good fleet for the Red Sea. Mean time, he remained at home, attentive to the internal police of the kingdom. He reformed the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, granted immunities to the European merchants, encouraged commerce, protected the caravans, and the inland merchants. He was not long be|fore he reaped the fruits of his wi&s;e admini&s;tration; Egypt was relieved, the public &s;afety e&s;tabli&s;hed, and agriculture encouraged.</P>
<P>Mean time, Abou Dahab conquered Yemen, depo&s;ed the &s;cheriff of Mecca, and &s;ub&s;tituted in his place emir Abdalla, who, to pay his court to Ali, gratified him with the title of Sultan of Egypt. I&s;ma&euml;l made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all the towns on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of the Arabian gulf.</P>
<P>In 1771, Ali &s;ent Abou Dahab with forty thou&s;and men to attempt the conque&s;t of Syria, and wrote to Count Orlow, the Ru&s;&s;ian admiral, then at Leghorn, making him large offers to form an alliance with him.
<PB N="129" REF="145">
The Count in return thanked him, wi&s;hed him &s;ucce&s;s, and made him great promi&s;es, which were never realized. He al&s;o negociated with Venice, promi&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t her to retake her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from the Turks, but the Republic declined this bold enterprize.</P>
<P>Abou Dahab took &s;ome towns of Syria, and drove the Ottomans be|fore him. This wretch had long meditated the ruin of Ali, his patron and his friend. He had accepted the command of the army, in order to gain it to his intere&s;t. Having &s;ecured them, he erected the &s;tandard of rebellion, withdrew the garri&s;ons from the conquered places, and re-en|tered Egypt. Not daring to attack the capital, he kept along the Red Sea, cro&s;&s;ed the De&s;erts, and entered Upper Egypt. His revolt was now manife&s;t, he gained the beys who commanded there, and marched towards Cairo.</P>
<P>Ali repented his placing the command in the hands of a traitor. He collected an army, which he entru&s;ted to I&s;ma&euml;l Bey, who likewi&s;e be|trayed him and joined Abou Dahab.</P>
<P>Ali, by the advice of his friends, determined to retire to St. John of Acre. He wrote to Count Orlow for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and in the middle of the night, accompanied by the beys his friends, and 7000 troops, he left Cairo, and fled acro&s;s the De&s;erts. He reached Gaza, but from agita|tion of mind, was taken very ill: in this &s;ituation the venerable &s;cheik Daher came to vi&s;it him, con&s;oled him that his &s;ituation was not de&s;pe|rate, and that the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron was at hand. With this con&s;olation, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Ru&s;&s;ian phy&s;ician, in a few weeks he recovered.</P>
<P>A Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron appearing before Acre, he wrote again to Count Orlow for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;ent al&s;o an amba&s;&s;ador to the Empre&s;s. In Augu&s;t, 1772, Ali took Jaffa and Rama. The&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es in&s;pired him with the hope of returning to Cairo. The chiefs of the Jani&s;aries in that capital al&s;o invited him to do &s;o. Therefore collecting the garri|&s;ons of the conquered towns, he began his march with 2250 Mamalukes, 3400 Mograbi, and 650 hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Abou Dahab met him with 12,000 men, and was defeated. Abou, by in&s;tilling into the minds of the Mahomedans, that Ali de&s;igned to abo|li&s;h their religion, and introduce Chri&s;tianity, procured an army of 20,000 men. The Jani&s;aries, however, refu&s;ed to join him.</P>
<P>Ali was unprepared for this event, he abandoned him&s;elf to de&s;pair, and fell dangerou&s;ly ill. His friends advi&s;ed him to retire to St. John of Acre, but he declared he would &s;ooner peri&s;h than retreat an inch.</P>
<P>On the 13th of April, 1773, the armies met. Both parties charged with fury, and notwith&s;tanding the inferiority of Ali's troops, they had at fir&s;t the advantage; but the Mograbi, corrupted by the promi&s;es of
<PB N="130" REF="146">
Abou Dahab, de&s;erted, and the fortune of the day was changed. Mo&s;t of Ali's friends fell round him; the &s;urvivors pre&s;&s;ed him to retire, but he replied, that his hour was come. The Mamalukes bravely peri&s;hed with their arms in their hands. Ali &s;lew two &s;oldiers who attempted to &s;eize him; and the lieutenant of Abou Dahab advancing, Ali, though wound|ed with two balls, &s;hot him with a pi&s;tol. He fought like a lion; but being beat down by the back &s;troke of a &s;abre, was &s;eized and carried to the tent of the conqueror, where he died of his wounds eight days after.</P>
<P>Ali was of the middle &s;ize, his carriage noble, and his character open and generous: he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an in&s;urmountable courage, and a lofty ge|nius. He died the victim of an ill-placed friend&s;hip. Had Ru&s;&s;ia availed her&s;elf of his offers, &s;he might have &s;ecured to her&s;elf the commerce of Arabia. He was only 45 years of age when he died. The Egyptians long mourned his lo&s;s; and &s;aw them&s;elves again plunged into all the mi&s;eries from which he had delivered them.</P>

<HEAD>ALLATIUS (LEO),</HEAD>
<P>KEEPER of the Vatican library, a native of Scio, and a celebrated writer of the 17th century. He was of great &s;ervice to the gentlemen of Port Royal in the controver&s;y they had with M.

<HEAD>ALLEGRI (ANTONIO),</HEAD>
<P>CALLED <HI>Corregio</HI> from the place of his birth, an eminent hi&s;torical painter, was born in the year 1494. Being de&s;cended of poor parents, and educated in an ob&s;cure village, he enjoyed none of tho&s;e advantages which contributed to form the other great painters of that illu&s;trious age. He &s;aw none of the &s;tatues of ancient Greece or Rome; nor any of the works of the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;chools of Rome and Venice. But Nature was his guide; and Corregio was one of her favourite pupils. To expre&s;s the facility with which he painted, he u&s;ed to &s;ay that he always had his thoughts ready at the end of his pencil.</P>
<P>The agreeable &s;mile, and the profu&s;ion of graces which he gave to his madonas, &s;aints, and children, have been taxed with being &s;ometimes un|natural; but &s;till they are amiable and &s;educing: an ea&s;y and flowing pencil, an union and harmony of colours, and a perfect intelligence of light and &s;hade, give an a&s;toni&s;hing relief to all his pictures, and have been the admiration both of his cotemporaries and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Annibal
<PB N="132" REF="148">
Caracci, who flouri&s;hed 50 years after him, &s;tudied and adopted his manner in preference to that of any other ma&s;ter. In a letter to his cou&s;in Louis, he expre&s;&s;es with great warmth the impre&s;&s;ion which was made on him by the fir&s;t &s;ight of Corregio's paintings:
<Q REND="inline">"Every thing which I &s;ee here," &s;ays he, "a&s;toni&s;hes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e; particularly the colour|ing and the beauty of the children. They live&mdash;they breathe&mdash;They &s;mile with &s;o much grace and &s;o much reality, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to refrain from &s;miling and partaking of their enjoyment. My heart is ready to break with grief when I think on the unhappy fate of poor Corregio&mdash;that &s;o wonderful a man (if he ought not rather to be called an angel) &s;hould fini&s;h his days &s;o mi&s;erably, in a country where his talents were never known!"</Q></P>
<P>From want of curio&s;ity or of re&s;olution, or from want of patronage, Corregio never vi&s;ited Rome, but remained his whole life at Parma, where the art of painting was little e&s;teemed, and of con&s;equence poorly rewarded. This concurrence of unfavourable circum&s;tances occa&s;ioned at la&s;t his premature death, at the age of 40. He was employed to paint the cupola of the cathedral at Parma, the &s;ubject of which is an a&s;&s;ump|tion of the Virgin; and having executed it in a manner that has long been the admiration of every per&s;on of good ta&s;te, for the grandeur of de&s;ign, and e&s;pecially for the boldne&s;s of the fore-&s;hortenings (an art which he fir&s;t and at once brought to the utmo&s;t perfection), he went to receive his payment. The canons of the church, either through ignorance or ba&s;e|ne&s;s, found fault with his work; and although the price originally agreed upon had been very moderate, they alledged that it was far above the merit of the arti&s;t, and forced him to accept of the paultry &s;um of 200 livres; which, to add to the indignity, they paid him in copper money. To carry home this unworthy load to his indigent wife and children, poor Corregio had to travel &s;ix or eight miles from Parma. The weight of his burden, the heat of the weather, and his chagrin at this villainous treatment, immediately threw him into a pleuri&s;y, which in three days put an end to his life and his misfortunes.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ervation of this magnificent work the world is indebted to Titian. As he pa&s;&s;ed through Parma, in the <HI>&s;uite</HI> of Charles V. he run in&s;tantly to &s;ee the <HI>chef d'oeavre</HI> of Corregio. While he was atten|tively viewing it, one of the principal canons of the church told him that &s;uch a grote&s;que performance did not merit his notice, and that they intended &s;oon to have the whole defaced.
<Q>"Have a care of what you do," replied the other, "if I were not Titian, I would certainly wi&s;h to be Corregio."</Q></P>
<P>Corregio's exclamation upon viewing a picture by Raphael is well known. Having long been accu&s;tomed to hear the mo&s;t unbounded ap|plau&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="149">
be&s;towed on the works of that divine painter, he by degrees be|came le&s;s de&s;irous than afraid of &s;eeing any of them. One, however, he at la&s;t had occa&s;ion to &s;ee. He examined it attentively for &s;ome minutes in profound &s;ilence; and then with an air of &s;atisfaction exclaimed, "I am &s;till a painter." Julio Romano, on &s;eeing &s;ome of Corregio's pictures at Parma, declared they were &s;uperior to any thing in painting he had yet beheld. One of the&s;e no doubt would be the famous Virgin and Child, with Mary Magdalene and St. Jerom: but whether our readers are to depend upon his opinion, or upon that of Lady Millar, who in her Letters from Italy, gives a very unfavourable account of it, we &s;hall not pre&s;ume to determine. This lady, however, &s;peaks in a very different &s;tyle of the no le&s;s famous <HI>Notte</HI> or Night of Corregio, of which &s;he &s;aw only a copy in the Duke's palace at Modena, the original having been &s;old for a great &s;um of money to the king of Poland.
<Q REND="inline">"It &s;urpri&s;es me very much, &s;ays &s;he, "to &s;ee how different the charac|ters are in this picture from that which I already have de&s;cribed to you. The &s;ubject is a Nativity; and the extraordinary beauty of this picture proceeds from the <HI>clair ob&s;cure:</HI> there are two different lights introduced, by means of which the per&s;onages are vi&s;ible; namely, the light proceeding from the body of the child, and the moon-light. The&s;e two are pre&s;erved di&s;tinct, and produce a mo&s;t wonderful effect. The child's body is &s;o luminous, that the &s;uperficies is nearly tran&s;pa|rent, and the rays of light emitted by it are verified in the effect they produce upon the &s;urrounding objects. They are not rays di&s;tinct and &s;eparate, like tho&s;e round the face of a &s;un that indicates an in|&s;urance-office; nor linear, like tho&s;e proceeding from the man in the almanack; but of a dazzling brightne&s;s: by their light you &s;ee clear|ly the face, neck, and hands, of the Virgin (the re&s;t of the per&s;on be|ing in &s;trong &s;hadow), the faces of the <HI>pa&s;tori</HI> who croud round the child, and particularly one woman, who holds her hand before her face, le&s;t her eyes &s;hould be &s;o dazzled as to prevent her from behold|ing the infant. This is a beautiful natural action, and is mo&s;t inge|niou&s;ly introduced. The &s;traw on which the child is laid appears gilt, from the light of his body &s;hining on it. The moon lights up the back-ground of the picture, which repre&s;ents a land&s;cape. Every object is di&s;tinct, as in a bright moon-light night; and there cannot be two lights in nature more different than tho&s;e which appear in the &s;ame picture. The virgin and the child are of the mo&s;t perfect beau|ty. There is a great variety of character in the different per&s;ons pre|&s;ent, yet that uniformity common to all herd&s;men and pea&s;ants. In &s;hort, this copy is &s;o admirable, that I was quite &s;orry to be obliged to lo&s;e &s;ight of it &s;o &s;oon; but I never &s;hall forget it. The Duke of

<P>THE &s;on of a clergyman of the &s;ame name, rector of Ditchet, Somer|&s;et&s;hire, for fifty years: his &s;on Richard was born at that place in 1611; the fir&s;t part of his education under his father, fitted him for the univer|&s;ity in 1627. That year he entered a commoner of St. Alban's Hall, in Oxford, where he took the degree of bachelor of arts. Thence he re|moved to New Inn, where he took his ma&s;ter's degree, and entering into holy orders, became an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to his father. The old gentleman being inclined to puritani&s;m, the &s;on fell into the &s;ame opinions, and be|ing a man of great zeal and learning, he was &s;oon con&s;idered as a man fit to be followed. In March, 1641, he &s;ucceeded to the living of Bat|comb, in Dor&s;et&s;hire, the duty of which he performed with much in|du&s;try and fidelity; and being a zealous covenanter, had &s;ome di&s;tur|bances with the king's forces in tho&s;e parts. He was, however, a great enemy to that enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit which prevailed in this country, on the ruin of the epi&s;copal church; this appears by his &s;ub&s;cribing a repre&s;en|tation, intitled,
<Q REND="inline">"The Te&s;timony of the Mini&s;try of Somer&s;et&s;hire to the Truth of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to the &s;olemn League and Covenant,"</Q>
printed in 1648. His indu&s;try and affection to the cau&s;e, procured him|&s;elf and his father to be con&s;tituted a&s;&s;i&s;tants to the commi&s;&s;ioners ap|pointed by parliament, for ejecting &s;candalous mini&s;ters. This was in 1654; and Mr. Wood tells us they acted with &s;everity enough. How|ever, on the Re&s;toration Mr. Allein &s;hewed a di&s;po&s;ition to yield obe|dience to the government, but could not come up to the terms of con|formity, which occa&s;ioned his being ejected from his living, after he had held it upwards of twenty years. After this, he continued to exerci&s;e his function privately, preaching &s;ometimes in his own hou&s;e, at others in the hou&s;es of gentlemen in the neighbourhood. He was once appre|hended at the &s;eat of Mr. Moore, who had been a member of parlia|ment, and who had invited him thither to preach to his family and &s;ome of his neighbours. Mr. Moore paid the fine, which was five pounds, for him.

He, however, e&s;caped impri&s;onment, as his great learning, piety, and exemplary life, had gained him &s;o high a reputation, that it would have been very unpopular to have &s;ent him to gaol.

He was di&s;tingui&s;hed for his plain, practical manner of preach|ing, and for the delight he took in the pa&s;toral office. His writings, which were mo&s;tly &s;mall tracts on religious &s;ubjects were much e&s;teemed and often printed. Although a non-conformi&s;t, he was not tinctured either with &s;pleen to the church, or di&s;loyalty to his prince; on the con|trary he lived in a fair corre&s;pondence with the clergy of his neighbour|hood, and the gentry paid him great re&s;pect, although of oppo&s;ite &s;enti|ments.</P>

In July, 1653, he was ad|mitted bachelor of arts, and became a tutor. In this arduous employ|ment he behaved him&s;elf with equal &s;kill and diligence; &s;everal of his pupils became very eminent non-conforming mini&s;ters, and not a few at|tained to good preferment in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. In 1655, he be|came a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the mini&s;try to Mr. G. Newton, of Taunton, in Somer|&s;et&s;hire, where he married the &s;ame year. His income was &s;mall, but that was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the profits of a boarding-&s;chool, which Mrs. Allein kept. During &s;even years that he lived in this manner, he di&s;charged his pa&s;|toral duty with incredible diligence; for be&s;ides preaching and catechi&s;|ing in the church, he &s;pent &s;everal afternoons in a week in vi&s;iting the people of the town, and exhorting them to a religious life. The&s;e appli|cations were at fir&s;t far from being welcome to many families; but his meekne&s;s, moderation, and unaffected piety, made him by degrees the delight of his pari&s;hioners. He was deprived in 1662, for noncon|formity. He preached, however, privately. His zeal and indu&s;try in
<PB N="136" REF="152">
this cour&s;e, brought him at length into trouble; &s;o that on the 26th day of May, 1663, he was committed to Ivelche&s;ter gaol, and was with &s;eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mini&s;ters, and fifty quakers, confined in one room, where they &s;uffere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> great hard&s;hips: however, they &s;till continued to preach till the a&s;&s;ize<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> The&s;e were held before Mr. Ju&s;tice Fo&s;ter, and at them, he was indite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for preaching on the 17th of May preceding; of which inditement h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was found guilty, and &s;entenced to pay a hundred marke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and to remain in pri&s;on till his fine was paid.

However when he was at liberty, he applied him&s;elf to his mini&s;try as earne&s;tly as ever, which brought him a grievous &s;ickne&s;s. The five miles act tak|ing place, he retired from Taunton to Wellington, where he continued but a &s;hort time, Mr. Mallack, a merchant, inviting him to lodge at a hou&s;e of his &s;ome di&s;tance from Taunton. In the &s;ummer of 1665, he was advi&s;ed to drink the waters near the Devizes, for his health. But before he left Mr. Mallack's hou&s;e, viz. on the 10th of July in that year, &s;ome friends came to take their leaves of him; they were &s;urpri&s;ed praying together, and for this were &s;entenced to &s;ixty days impri&s;on|ment, which him&s;elf, &s;even mini&s;ters, and forty private per&s;ons, &s;uffered in the county gaol. This hindered his going to the waters; and his di&s;|ea&s;e returning, he lo&s;t another &s;ummer. At length, in 1667, he went, but was far from receiving the benefit he expected. After &s;ome time he went to Dorche&s;ter, where he grew better; but applying him&s;elf again to preaching, catechi&s;ing, and other duties, his di&s;temper returned with &s;uch violence, that he lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs. His death was then daily expected; but by degrees he grew &s;omewhat better, and at length went to Bath, where his health altered &s;o much, that his friends were in hopes he would have held out &s;everal years; but growing &s;uddenly wor&s;e again, he fini&s;hed his life there, in the month of November, 1668, be|ing &s;omewhat above 35 years old. He was a man of great learning, and greater charity; zealous in his own way of wor&s;hipping God, but not in the lea&s;t bitter towards any Chri&s;tians who wor&s;hipped in another manner. He pre&s;erved a great re&s;pect for the church, notwith&s;tanding all his &s;ufferings; and was eminently loyal to his prince, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everities of the times. His writings breathe a true &s;pirit of piety, for which they have been always and de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed. Anthony Wood has treated his memory very rudely, and betrayed that &s;pleen he

<HEAD>ALLEYN (EDWARD),</HEAD>
<P>A CELEBRATED comedian in the reigns of Elizabeth and James I. and the founder of a college at Dulwich, in the county of Surrey, which flouri&s;hes to this day. He was of re&s;pectable parents, who lived in good fa&s;hion and credit; his father, who, it appears, was of the hou&s;hold to queen Elizabeth, is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an e&s;tate in York|&s;hire. Our Mr. Alleyn was born in the pari&s;h of St. Botolph, Bi&s;hop&s;|gate, London, September 1, 1566, as we learn from a memorandum in his own hand writing. Dr. Fuller expre&s;sly &s;ays, near Devon&s;hire Hou&s;e, the &s;pot where Devon&s;hire Square now &s;tands, where, in his time, was the &s;ign of the Pye. The &s;ame author &s;ays he commenced &s;tage player very young, which is not improbable, notwith&s;tanding his father's ea&s;y circum&s;tances, as he might be aver&s;e to any more &s;erious cour&s;e of life. He is &s;aid to have applied to the &s;tudy of literature; but, by what he has left of his writing, it does not appear he ever engaged him&s;elf deeply in &s;chola&s;tic &s;tudy. From various te&s;timonies which have been given of him, it appears he was a man of excellent natural parts. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a flexible genius, great corporal agility, a lively temper, faithful memory,
<PB N="139" REF="155">
and fluent elocution, and was in per&s;on, as appears by a picture pre&s;erv|ed at Dulwich, of a &s;tately mien and appearance: all this might induce a young man to engage him&s;elf in that gay and popular profe&s;&s;ion. And there are al&s;o &s;ome other authorities which affirm he applied early to that vocation. It appears from &s;ome of the papers of the lord keeper Pickering, &s;till in being, that Alleyn acted in &s;everal of the tragedies of Chri&s;topher Marlow, the poet, and was arrived at great excellence there|in. Now as Marlow died in 1592, he mu&s;t have been on the &s;tage be|fore that time. He had then &s;o captivated the town, and monopolized the favour of the public, by his ready command of voice, countenance, and ge&s;ture, and &s;o judiciou&s;ly adapted them to the characters he played, that he could animate and improve the mo&s;t lifele&s;s compo&s;itions, as wholly to engage his audience; &s;o that in the perfection of the player they forgot the defects of the poet. Haywood, in his prologue to Marlow's Jew of Malta, calls him, Proteus for &s;hapes, and Ro&s;cius for a tongue. His character we have in a little tract written by Mr. Na&s;h, a celebrated &s;atiri&s;t of tho&s;e times. Thus we &s;ee Mr. Alleyn was early famous upon the &s;tage; he u&s;ually played in the be&s;t dramatic pieces, and the mo&s;t capital parts in them. He was certainly one of the original actors in the plays of our immortal Shake&s;peare, as al&s;o in &s;ome of Ben Jon&s;on's; but what characters he performed is difficult now to a&s;certain, as the editors of tho&s;e times did not di&s;tingui&s;h the character each actor played. We find his celebrity as an actor mentioned not only in pro&s;e but in ver&s;e. Many writers for and concerning the &s;tage have be&s;towed &s;ome fine general characters on him; and Sir Richard Baker &s;ays, he was as famous for his hone&s;ty as his acting. But any particulars of his own life, except what may be gleaned from detached notes and minutes he has left of his own affairs, we have none. It is &s;trange, and rather an in&s;tance of ingratitude in his cotemporaries, that no one &s;hould have collected &s;ufficient materials to have compiled &s;ome monument to his memory. However, by help of his papers &s;till extant, and by other antiquities of his college, &s;ome part of the ob&s;curity with which his ac|tions have been hidden, has been done away: and his biographers have been enabled to di&s;charge him of &s;ome mi&s;repre&s;entations with which he has been unju&s;tly accu&s;ed, and to &s;hew him in a fairer and &s;tronger light than has been hitherto done.</P>
<P>How he accumulated a fortune &s;ufficient to lay the foundation, and endow &s;uch a large and commodious edifice, was naturally one of the fir&s;t objects of inquiry. Be&s;ides his paternal inheritance, which would lay a foundation for his fortune, the advantages he mu&s;t make by acting plays, to a man of his provident di&s;po&s;ition would con&s;iderably improve
<PB N="140" REF="156">
it. He was not only an actor, but manager and owner of a theatre, and had a company of comedians of his own, by whom he is &s;aid to have ama&s;&s;ed a good fortune. This was the Fortune playhou&s;e, near Whitecro&s;s-&s;treet, Moor Fields. He was al&s;o keeper of the king's wild bea&s;ts, and ma&s;ter of the bear garden, &s;ituated at Bank&s;ide, Southwark; both which places were much re&s;orted to, and mu&s;t yield him a great profit, it is &s;aid not le&s;s than 500l. per annum. A little before his death he &s;old his &s;hare and patent. By marriages al&s;o, for he was twice, if not thrice, married, and into good families, he gained &s;omething hand|&s;ome. Thus his riches were derived from various &s;ources.</P>
<P>The motives which have been a&s;cribed to Mr. Alleyn for founding his college, and which have been readily believed by many who &s;hould have had &s;en&s;e enough to reject them, are too ridiculous to need repeti|tion; the &s;tory of the devil appearing in a dance, and frightening Mr. Alleyn &s;o much as to induce him to quit his profe&s;&s;ion and build this college as an atonement, is &s;ufficiently refuted by an entry in his own diary, by which it appears that he continued his connection with the &s;tage &s;ome time after he had built his college. To a&s;cribe &s;uch a mo|tive to an action, which &s;eems to have ari&s;en only from a due &s;en&s;e of piety and benevolence, is highly reprehen&s;ible. A peru&s;al of Mr. Al|leyn's private papers, &s;hew him to be a man habituated to devotion, for at the end of his quarterly account, he concludes with a pious ejacu|lation, acknowledging all he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of to be from God; indeed the &s;tage &s;eems rather to have in&s;pired him with a principle of goodne&s;s, from the le&s;&s;ons of virtue he had there imbibed. When Mr. Alleyn had re&s;olved on his foundation, he did not like others po&s;tpone it until his death, but immediately &s;et about the execution of it while in health and &s;trength, and before he was forty-eight years of age. He began, there|fore, to build his college at Dulwich in Surrey, about five miles from London, after a de&s;ign of Mr. Inigo Jones, who was a witne&s;s to the deed of &s;ettlement; and it appears it was in good forwardne&s;s in 1614. He de&s;igned it for the re&s;idence of &s;ix poor men, &s;ix poor women, and twelve poor children, between the age of four and &s;ix, to be there kept, taught, and maintained, a &s;choolma&s;ter to be provided for them, who was to have his diet, lodging, and a &s;tipend; the children to be main|tained there until they are fourteen or &s;ixteen years of age. The edi|fice con&s;i&s;ts of the college and chapel, which, with the fitting up of the gardens, co&s;t him betwixt 8 and 10,000l. It was fini&s;hed in 1617, as appears by a diary which he kept of all his college accounts, proceed|ings, and occurrences, and which afford his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors an opportunity of &s;eeing how this noble foundation was begun and carried on. After he had built the college, he found &s;ome difficulty to obtain a charter to
<PB N="141" REF="157">
&s;ettle his lands in mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tmain, as he propo&s;ed to endow it with 800l. per annum, for the &s;upport of the above objects of charity, and of a ma&s;ter, warden, and four fellows, three of which were to be eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and the other a &s;kilful organi&s;t. This ob&s;truction aro&s;e from the lord chan|cellor Bacon; but at length he was allowed to &s;ettle his lands his own way, and obtained a patent in 1619, by virtue whereof, Mr. Alleyn, on the 1&s;t of June that year, in the chapel of the college, called the Chapel of God's Gift, did execute a proper deed of &s;ettlement, in pre&s;ence of many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. His diary he kept for five years longer, we find no book of accounts of his kept after his wife lived with him until 1623, when &s;he died, and in about a year or two after he married his la&s;t wife, who &s;urvived him. He died the 21&s;t of November, 1626, in the 61&s;t year of his age, and was buried in the chapel of his college, and has a tomb-&s;tone over his grave, with an in&s;cription.</P>
<P>By his will, dated November 13, 1626, he bequeathed his wife 1500l. chargeable on an inn in Southwark, and &s;ome tenements in St. Saviour's pari&s;h, and all his jewels. He al&s;o gave his &s;eal ring with his arms, to be worn by the ma&s;ter and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to the college, and ap|pointed a common &s;eal to be made for it. He al&s;o wills, that his execu|tors &s;hould build ten alms-hou&s;es in the pari&s;h of St. Botolph, Bi&s;hop&s;|gate, and the like number in the pari&s;h of St. Saviour, Southwark, for the poor of the&s;e re&s;pective pari&s;hes, to be likewi&s;e members of the &s;aid college.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much of the founder, we mu&s;t now enter further in|to the account of his college. By the deed he a&s;&s;igned &s;everal parcels of land, to the amount of 800l. per annum, for the maintenance of a ma&s;ter, a warden, (both which mu&s;t be unmarried, and always of the name of Alleyn or Allen) and four fellows, in the&s;e the government of the col|lege is inve&s;ted; of &s;ix poor brethren and &s;ix poor &s;i&s;ters, and twelve poor children. In the deed is recited of what degree the fellows, bro|thers, and &s;i&s;ters, and of what condition the &s;cholars are to be, the form of election and admittance, the oaths to be re&s;pectively taken, and the duties of each office. The ma&s;ter or fellows are not to be ab&s;ent but by leave of all. The government is conducted with great decorum. The per&s;ons in the college a&s;&s;emble at prayers twice a day, in the chapel, by one of the clergymen belonging to the foundation. When the ma&s;ter dies the warden &s;ucceeds. The old men and women mu&s;t be &s;ingle, and of undoubted character. The front of the building is occupied by the chapel and the ma&s;ter's apartments; in the wings the inhabitants have apartments: the right wing was rebuilt in 1739; and by the care and attention of the pre&s;ent members of the college, money is now accumu|lating to rebuild the left wing, a part of which is at pre&s;ent occupied by

<P>In the letters patent granted by James I. that monarch &s;tyles Mr. Al|leyn, "Our tru&s;tie and well beloved Edward Alleyn, E&s;q. of Dulwich, in our county of Surrey, chief ma&s;ter, ruler and over&s;eer of all and &s;in|gular our games of bears and bulls, and ma&s;tiff dogs and ma&s;tiff bitches." By this we may perceive that bull-baiting was in great vogue in tho&s;e days, and may conclude as the ma&s;tiff was at that time in great repute, Mr. Alleyn mu&s;t have made great profit by the &s;ale of them.</P>
<P>The manor of Dulwich is given (among other things) to the ma&s;ter, warden, &amp;c. and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever, and for no other intent or purpo&s;e what&s;oever. Yet Mr. Alleyn before his death was &s;o ill advi&s;ed as to make an addition to the foundation by directing that there &s;hould be &s;ix chaunters for mu&s;ic and &s;inging, and thirty members. But lord chancellor King, on its being heard before him, declared that Mr. Al|leyn could not by his order or &s;tatute of 1626, add any per&s;ons to the corporation, or make any new members, he having, in 1619, conveyed all his effects to the &s;ole and only u&s;e of the ma&s;ter, warden, &amp;c. and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors for ever.</P>

Af|ter he had taken the degree of bachelor of arts, he was cho&s;en mode|rator in philo&s;ophy; which office he continued to di&s;charge, till the di&s;|turbances
<PB N="143" REF="161">
of the kingdom interrupted the &s;tudies and repo&s;e of the uni|ver&s;ity. In 1641, Mr. Alle&s;try, among other Oxford &s;cholars engaged in the king's &s;ervice, and continued therein till Sir John Biron, who was &s;ent with a party of hor&s;e to countenance and &s;upport the &s;cholars in arms, withdrew from Oxford; upon which he returned, with many others, to his gown and &s;tudies. Soon after a party of the rebels hav|ing entered Oxford, and plundered the colleges, Mr. Alle&s;try narrowly e&s;caped being &s;everely handled by them. In October following he took arms again, and was pre&s;ent in the battle fought by king Charles, and the rebels under the command of the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, in Keinton Field, in Warwick&s;hire; after which, under&s;tanding that the king de&s;igned immediately to march to Oxford, and to take up his re&s;idence at the deanery of Chri&s;t Church, he ha&s;tened thither to prepare for his ma|je&s;ty's reception; but, in his way, was taken pri&s;oner by a party of hor&s;e from Broughton Hou&s;e, which was garri&s;oned by the Lord Say, for the parliament. His confinement was very &s;hort, the garri&s;on &s;urrender|ing it&s;elf to the king's forces, who &s;ummoned it in their march. And now Mr. Alle&s;try &s;ettled him&s;elf again to his &s;tudies, and in the next &s;pring took his degree of ma&s;ter of arts; and the &s;ame year his life was greatly endangered by a pe&s;tilential di&s;temper, which raged in the gar|ri&s;on of Oxford. Soon after his recovery, he entered a third time into his maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, in a regiment formed out of the Oxford <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cholars. In this &s;ervice he continued till the end of the war, and then went into holy orders, at a time when he had no pro&s;pect of worldly advantage. He was tutor to &s;everal young gentlemen and &s;tudents, and di&s;charged the office of cen&s;or of the college. He bore a part in that &s;ignal te&s;t of loyalty, which the univer&s;ity of Oxford gave, in their decree and judgment again&s;t the Solemn League and Covenant; for which, in July, 1648, he was pro&s;cribed and expelled the univer&s;ity by the parliament vi&s;iters. Being thus driven from Oxford, he retired into Shrop&s;hire, and was en|tertained as chaplain to the honourable Francis Newport, and upon the death of his father Lord Newport, he was &s;ent over into France to take care of that nobleman's effects. Having di&s;patched this affair with good &s;ucce&s;s, he came back to his employment, and continued in it till king Charles II. marched into England with his Scotch army, and until his wonderful e&s;cape at Worce&s;ter; at which time the managers of the king's affairs wanting an intelligent and faithful per&s;on to &s;end over to his ma|je&s;ty, Mr. Alle&s;try was de&s;ired to undertake the journey; which he did, and having attended the king at Rouen, and received his di&s;patches, he returned to England. Here he found his friends Mr. Dolben and Mr. Fell, who had likewi&s;e been bani&s;hed the univer&s;ity, re&s;iding privately,

and performing the offices of the church of England for the loyali&s;ts; upon which he joined them, and continued with them, till Sir Anthony Cope, a loyal gentleman of con&s;iderable quality and fortune, in Oxford|&s;hire, prevailed upon him to live in his family; where he continued &s;e|veral years, with liberty of going or &s;taying as occa&s;ion required; and by this means he was enabled, without being taken notice of, to convey me&s;&s;ages to the king from his friends. After &s;everal difficult journies &s;ucce&s;sfully performed, he was &s;ent over in the winter before his maje&s;|ty's re&s;toration, into Flanders; from whence returning with letters, he was &s;eized, upon his landing at Dover, by a party of &s;oldiers; but had the addre&s;s to &s;ecure his letters, by conveying them to a faithful hand. Being guarded up to London, he was examined by a committee of the council of &s;afety, and &s;ent pri&s;oner to Lambeth Hou&s;e, where he con|tracted a dangerous &s;ickne&s;s. After &s;ix or eight weeks confinement, he was &s;et at liberty, and returned into Oxford&s;hire; from whence, after a &s;hort &s;tay, he went into Shrop&s;hire to vi&s;it his relations. Soon after the re&s;toration, Mr. Alle&s;try was made a canon of Chri&s;t Church, and readily concurred in repairing the injuries and decays that church and college had &s;uffered during the u&s;urpation. At the &s;ame time he under|took one of the lecture&s;hips of the city of Oxford, with a view to in&s;til principles of loyalty into the minds of the citizens; yet he never received any part of the profits, but con&s;tantly di&s;tributed it among the poor. He took the degree of doctor of divinity, on the 3d of October, 1660, and was appointed one of the king's chaplains in ordinary; and &s;oon after, upon a vacancy of the divinity chair, he was cho&s;en regis profe&s;|&s;or. In 1665, the king conferred upon Dr. Alle&s;try the provo&s;t&s;hip of Eton college, which he held to his death. In 1679, finding his health, and particularly his &s;ight, much impaired, he re&s;igned the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of divinity, and had the &s;atisfaction to be &s;ucceeded therein by Dr. Jane, of who&s;e abilities he had perfect knowledge. And now the decay of his con&s;titution terminating in a drop&s;y, he removed to London, to be nearer the advice of phy&s;icians; but medicines proving ineffectual, he died in January, 1680, and was buried in Eton chapel, under a mo|nument of white marble. We &s;hall give his character from the account of his life contained in the preface to his &s;ermons. He was a con&s;ider|able benefactor to Eton college, and rai&s;ed the credit and reputation of the &s;chool, which he found in a very low condition. There are extant forty &s;ermons of Dr. Alle&s;try's, the greate&s;t part of which were preached before the king, and upon &s;olemn occa&s;ions. It is much to be regretted, that he could not be prevailed upon to publi&s;h his lectures, which, when fir&s;t delivered, were heard with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction and applau&s;e.

<P>A VERY learned and eminent divine of the church of England, al|though a native of France, and well known in the republic of letters for his many and excellent writings. He was born at Alen&ccedil;on, in the year 1641; and having received an excellent education, which highly improved his natural parts, he became mini&s;ter to a reformed church at Rouen; where he publi&s;hed many learned and curious pieces, by which he acquired a great reputation. He was called from Rouen to Charen|ton, which was the principal reformed church in France, the village in which it &s;tood lying a little more than a league from Paris; we mu&s;t therefore con&s;ider this removal as the highe&s;t te&s;timony of re&s;pect his

brethren could &s;hew him. Being now in the zenith of his preferment, and in a condition to do good &s;ervice to the church, he applied him&s;elf to the ta&s;k with the utmo&s;t zeal, and preached many excellent &s;ermons in defence of the faith, again&s;t the archbi&s;hop of Meaux; who was then labouring to overturn the reformed religion, by &s;eeming conce&s;&s;ions to its profe&s;&s;ors. Some of his &s;ermons were afterwards printed in Hol|land, and are de&s;ervedly commended by Bayle.</P>
<P>Upon the revocation of the edict of Nantz, Mr. Alfix found him&s;elf obliged to quit France, and prepared an affecting farewel di&s;cour&s;e to his congregation, which he had not an opportunity to deliver; it was afterwards printed, and de&s;ervedly celebrated. This edict was revoked in 1685, and the reformed bani&s;hed France; on which Mr. Allix, by advice of his friends, repaired to England. Here, on account of his exten&s;ive learning and great knowledge of eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, he met a very favourable reception. He applied him&s;elf clo&s;ely to learn the Engli&s;h language; and &s;oon attained to a &s;urpri&s;ing perfection, as appeared by a book he publi&s;hed in defence of the Chri&s;tian religion, which he dedicated to King James, in very re&s;pectful terms; acknow|ledging at the &s;ame time, not only his per&s;onal obligations to that prince, but al&s;o his kindne&s;s to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed refugees in general. He was &s;oon complimented with the degree of doctor in divinity, and in 1690, had the trea&s;urer&s;hip of the church of Sali&s;bury be&s;towed on him. It was propo&s;ed he &s;hould have publi&s;hed an authentic hi&s;tory of the councils; but this mi&s;carried for want of encouragement. He wrote however &s;everal treati&s;es on eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, equally learned and entertaining, which were very u&s;eful to the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, and attacked warmly both by the Romi&s;h prie&s;ts and princes. The&s;e pieces rai&s;|ed Dr. Allix's credit as high in this country as it was in France. In 1699, he wrote a very learned book in defence of the Trinity, which had con&s;iderable effect, and has always been looked upon as a piece of great value, with re&s;pect to Hebrew literature. He wrote likewi&s;e &s;everal other learned and ingenious treati&s;es, on curious and important &s;ubjects. He continued, for upwards of thirty years, an active mem|ber of the republic of letters, and an able and affectionate defender of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. Some of his pieces have been &s;everely cen&s;ured, particularly by Mr. Bayle, and his orthodoxy has by many been called in que&s;tion. Our author however continued &s;teady in his principles and was &s;o well known to be a zealous defender of the church of Eng|land, that Mr. Whi&s;ton thought proper to con&s;ult him when he fir&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> propo&s;ed writing in &s;upport of his opinions.</P>

He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great learning, a wonderful liveline&s;s of temper; and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf on all &s;ubjects with &s;o much &s;prightline&s;s, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to flag in his company. He was con&s;ulted by the greate&s;t men of the age, and acknowledged as a man of the fir&s;t abilities by the mo&s;t e&s;teemed critics. His attention was given to the whole circle of &s;ciences, which fall under the cognizance of a &s;cho|lar or divine. All the&s;e he had well dige&s;ted, and his &s;ermons evince him to be an admirable orator, and a profound &s;cholar. The ancient authors which he publi&s;hed te&s;tify his &s;kill in critici&s;m, and his perfect knowledge of antiquity. His treati&s;es on eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory di&s;cover a prodigious fund of reading, an exact comprehen&s;ion of his &s;ubject, and his &s;incere zeal for the prote&s;tant religion. His thorough ac|quaintance with the Hebrew and Rabbinical learning, was di&s;played in his laborious performance re&s;pecting the Trinity.

At la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they reached Quiloa. The king of that place having given &s;ome cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect his conduct, Almeida re&s;olved to be&s;iege the city.

<P><PB N="149" REF="167">From hence they &s;ailed to Momba&s;&s;a, and immediately attacked that place. A &s;hot from the Portugueze &s;et fire to the powder magazine, which &s;o terrified the inhabitants that they abandoned the fort. Hav|ing cau&s;ed the port to be &s;ounded, and finding water &s;ufficient, he entered the harbour, and then &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to require the king to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the king of Portugal; but the me&s;&s;enger was refu&s;ed admittance. Almeida endeavoured to &s;eize &s;ome of the natives, and took pri&s;oner a dome&s;tic of the king, from whom he had intelligence that the king had received into his pay 4000 auxiliaries, and expected more. On this intelligence he re&s;olved to be&s;iege the place; and &s;et fire to a part of the city. The natives attacked the Portugueze, although at the &s;ame time employed in extingui&s;hing the flames; which however proved their be&s;t friends, and obliged the enemy to retire. Next day, when the flames abated, the Portugueze again entered the city, and were much annoyed by the narrowne&s;s of the &s;treets, and the darts of the ene|my flung from the hou&s;es. However, Almeida &s;oon having &s;ecured the palace, the Portugueze joined their &s;trength, and obliged the natives to &s;eek their &s;afety by flight, and make off to a wood, to which the king had retreated. The city was plundered, but mo&s;t of the valuable effects had been carried away. The Portugueze writers tell us, they killed in this action 1500, and took 2000 pri&s;oners, with the lo&s;s only of five men killed, and &s;everal wounded.</P>
<P>From hence he &s;ailed with his fleet for Melinda, but by tempe&s;tuous weather, was driven three leagues beyond; from thence they proceed|ed to the i&s;land of Anchidive, where he built a fort, and &s;ent &s;ome of his &s;hips out to cruize. Here he received deputies from the king of Onor, to treat of peace, and al&s;o the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a pyratical chief, of the name of Timoia. However a circum&s;tance &s;oon happened to &s;hew the former was not &s;incere; and the viceroy &s;ailed to Onor, and burned &s;ome &s;hips in the harbour. A day or two after, he &s;ent his &s;on to burn the other &s;hips: a &s;mart action en&s;ued, and the Por|tugueze were obliged to retreat. Almeida &s;ailed next day to Cananor, where he found it nece&s;&s;ary to build a &s;trong fort to protect his country|men again&s;t the Arabians, who, jealous of the Portugueze, did them every injury in their power.</P>
<P>While Almeida remained here, he had the happine&s;s to receive an emba&s;&s;y from the king of Nar&s;inga, offering friend&s;hip, and his daughter as a wife for John the &s;on of Emanuel.

On his pa&s;&s;age he was in|formed that the &s;hips were not yet afloat, but lay in the docks, under cover of a rampart, and a &s;trong garri&s;on of 4000 men. Almeida had only 700, and with the&s;e he re&s;olved to attack the enemy. He attempt|ed to land and burn the &s;hips; and after a violent conflict &s;ucceeded. A &s;trong proof of the &s;uperiority of the Portugueze at this time in war, for the enemy &s;ought with de&s;perate courage, there being many among them who had taken an oath to conquer or die. The&s;e devotees had all their heads &s;haven, and were de&s;troyed to a man. Almeida having made good his landing, advanced to the city, and &s;et it on fire, being fearful of the con&s;equences of permitting his men to plunder it. The men murmured at being deprived of &s;uch a rich booty; but this the viceroy di&s;regarded, and to keep them employed, di&s;patched his &s;on with a &s;quadron to cruize again&s;t the Arabians, who in an engagement with the enemy's fleet lo&s;t his life. Almeida, who had often &s;hewn that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great fortitude, now gave a &s;triking proof of it; and tho&s;e who lamented the death of young Almeida with too much &s;orrow, he told them, "That he had never wi&s;hed a long, but a glorious life for his &s;on; and for his part, he thanked God for honouring him with &s;o glorious a death."</P>
<P>While he commanded in India, Albuquerque was making conque&s;ts for his country to the northward; but as he did not act under Almeida's in&s;tructions, the latter was offended, and even wrote to &s;ome of the ene|my's Chiefs, that Albuquerque acted without his orders. However, the exploits of the latter drew the attention of the court of Portugal, and be was appointed to &s;uper&s;ede Almeida in his viceroy&s;hip. When the or|der for the viceroy's return was brought, he was employed in fitting out a fleet to revenge the death of his &s;on. This furni&s;hed him with an excu&s;e for not delivering up his government; and he &s;ailed on an ex|pedition to Dabul, landed there, defeated the enemy, and made a mo&s;t dreadful &s;laughter, not &s;paring even the infants. The next day the city was given up to be plundered, and afterwards burned. This was the fate of many other places on the&s;e coa&s;ts. He then cruized along the coa&s;t until he fell in with the enemy's fleet, engaged and totally defeated it, killing 4000 men.

On his return, he was ordered to the Anchidive i&s;lands; when being informed of a large fleet fitting out at Calicut, Lawrence imme|diately &s;ailed to that place, engaged it, and after a fierce conflict, gave them a total defeat.

He was di&s;patched with eight &s;hips to annoy the Arabians, and at fir&s;t was &s;ucce&s;sful. He put into the port of Chaul, a large and opulent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ity, adjoining to the king|dom

of Cambaya. Here he received advice that the &s;ultan of Egypt had fitted out a con&s;iderable force, manned with his brave&s;t &s;oldiers. It con&s;i&s;ted of five large &s;hips, and &s;ix galleys, to which the king of Cam|baya joined thirty &s;loops of war. When they appeared off Chaul, the Portugueze concluded they were the &s;hips of Albuquerque, and made no preparation to engage; the Egyptian admiral entered the river, but his allies remained out at &s;ea.</P>
<P>The next day Lawrence Almeida weighed anchor and attacked the admiral's &s;hip. In this action Almeida was wounded. His officers, find|ing they were becalmed, and could not come to clo&s;e quarters with the enemy, advi&s;ed him to return. This he declined, and &s;oon receiv|ed another de&s;perate wound in the face with a dart. The action con|tinued at a di&s;tance, Almeida not being able to get near his enemy. Other captains were more fortunate, they boarded and took two &s;hips. The next day, the fleet from &s;ea came in and joined the enemy. The Portugueze held a council, and were almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly of opi|nion, that they ought to put to &s;ea in the night; this they endeavoured to effect; but the enemy pur&s;ued and came up with the admiral's &s;hip, which was in the rear, and &s;urrounded her. An unfortunate &s;hot ren|dering it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;teer her, &s;he ran aground. The Portugueze captains had a &s;trong de&s;ire to a&s;&s;i&s;t their admiral, but the violence of the tide prevented them. However they &s;ent a boat to bring Almeida away; but he refu&s;ed to quit his fellow &s;oldiers in this di&s;tre&s;s.

Almeida at la&s;t received another wound in his thigh, which quite di&s;abled him; but being placed in a chair which was la&s;hed to the ma&s;t, he &s;till continued to animate his men, until a &s;hot in the brea&s;t killed him. The Portu|gueze on board this unfortunate &s;hip were now reduced to twenty, who &s;till continued to defend them&s;elves; but the enemy attempting to board her, &s;ucceeded.

where the &s;mall-pox unhappily prevailing, two of them died of it. We know not if this &s;urviving brother took any degrees or not, but it is pro|bable he did, &s;ince he entered into holy orders, and in the year 1618 had the rectory of Wooley in Huntingdon&s;hire. Here he performed his duty with great chearfulne&s;s and alacrity; and notwith&s;tanding he was twice invited back to his native country, by &s;ome who would have ventured their utmo&s;t to have placed him on the throne of Ru&s;&s;ia; yet he preferred remaining with his flock, and &s;erving God in the humble &s;tation of a pari&s;h prie&s;t. Yet in 1643, he underwent the &s;evere&s;t trials from the rage of the fanatics, who, not &s;atisfied with depriving him of his living, in&s;ulted him in a mo&s;t barbarous manner; and having &s;ent a file of mu&s;keteers to pull him out of the pulpit, as he was preaching on Sunday, they turned his wife and children out of doors, and threw his goods into the &s;treet. In this di&s;tre&s;s, he rai&s;ed a tent under &s;ome tree<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the church-yard near his hou&s;e, where he and his family lived for a week. One day having procured a few eggs, and picked up &s;ome rotten wood and dried &s;ticks, with which he made a fire in the church porch to boil them, his implacable adver&s;aries came and kicked out his fire, and de&s;troyed his eggs. After this, as he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a little property, he made a &s;mall purcha&s;e in that neighbourhood, built a hou&s;e, and lived there for &s;ome years. He was enabled to do this in &s;ome degree by the pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter who &s;ucceeded him, who hone&s;tly paid him a fifth part of the income of the living, (being the allowance made by parliament to ejected mini&s;ters,) treated him with great humanity, and did him all the &s;ervices in his power. It is a pity this man's name is not pre&s;erved; his conduct in this re&s;pect being more laudable, as it was &s;ingular. Afterwards, probably on the death or removal of this gentle|man, Mr. Alphery left Huntingdon&s;hire, and re&s;ided at Hammer&s;mith, until by the re&s;toration he was re&s;tored to his living. He then returned to Huntingdon&s;hire, where he did not remain long, for being then near eighty years of age, and very infirm, he could not perform the duty of his function. He therefore appointed a curate, and returned to his &s;on's hou&s;e at Hammer&s;mith, where he &s;hortly after died, full of years and honour.

<HEAD>ALREDUS, ALURED, or ALUREDUS, <HI>of Beverly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AN ancient Engli&s;h hi&s;torian; he is &s;aid to have had his education in the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, where he acquired not only great &s;kill in
<PB N="156" REF="174">
divinity, but al&s;o became a good philo&s;opher and hi&s;torian. He return|ed afterwards into his native country, York&s;hire; where he became a &s;ecular prie&s;t, one of the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nons and trea&s;urers of the church of St. John of Beverly. Some hi&s;torians po&s;itively affirm, that he flouri&s;hed under king Stephen, and continued his annals to the year 1136. But others, with more appearance of truth, tell us that he flouri&s;hed under Henry I. and died in the year 1126, in which year they a&s;&s;ert that he ended his annals. His hi&s;tory however contradicts this, as it is continued to the twenty-ninth of Henry I. con&s;equently he died in 1128, or 9. His preface to his work informs us, that he was a man devoted to his &s;tudies, and rather in narrow circum&s;tances. He intended at fir&s;t no more than an abridgement of the hi&s;tory of the ancient Britons; but when he had gone thus far, a de&s;ire of pur&s;uing the thread of his &s;tory, led him to add the Saxon, and then the Norman hi&s;tory, down to his own time. This was the only piece he wrote, notwith&s;tanding the a&s;&s;ertions of &s;everal great men. This abridgement of our hi&s;tory from Brutus to Henry I. is one of the mo&s;t valuable pieces that has e&s;caped the rage of time. It is written in a conci&s;e, elegant Latin &s;tyle, with great per&s;pi|cuity, and a more than ordinary attention to dates and authorities. He may with great propriety be called the Engli&s;h Florus; his plan being nearly the &s;ame, and equally happy in the execution. It &s;eems won|derful that Leland does not give him a place among our Engli&s;h writers, as it is clear he had &s;een our author's hi&s;tory. The rea&s;on &s;eems to have been, that Leland con&s;idered him only as the author of an abridgement of Jeffery of Monmouth's hi&s;tory. In this he was mi&s;taken, for our author is by no means a mere tran&s;criber of the Briti&s;h hi&s;tory, but went much further than the author he is &s;aid to have copied. Be&s;ides, it is doubtful whether he ever &s;aw Jeffery of Monmouth's hi&s;tory; if he had, it is difficult to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on why he did not mention the au|thor, as he is very exact in other places. If he had really been Jeffery of Monmouth's tran&s;lator, why &s;hould he have concealed it?</P>
<P>The MSS. of his work are very &s;carce, and very few who mention it, have &s;een it. Mr. Jo&s;&s;elin, in his catalogue of Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, a&s;&s;ures us the MS. was in the hands of Mr. Nettleton. The MS. from whence Mr. Hearne publi&s;hed it at Oxford, in 1716, belonged to T. Rawlin&s;on, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Mr. Hearne acknowledges it was the only one he ever &s;aw. He calls it the Annals of Alured of Beverly, which, as the dates are con&s;tantly pre&s;erved, it may with propriety be called. John Witham&s;ted, a very ancient writer, &s;peaking of our author, &s;ays, that he wrote a chronicle of what happened from the &s;ettlement of Brutus, to the time of the Normans. This authority is much to the honour of our hi&s;torian, for Witham&s;ted was a critic. This work therefore, and
<PB N="157" REF="175">
the hi&s;tory of St. John of Beverly, are all that fall from our author's pen. The hi&s;tory of St. John of Beverly is in being, in the Cotton library: but it appears by the title to be a collection of records, rather than a hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Mr. Hearne has added &s;ome notes to his edition, and a preface, wherein he endeavours to vindicate our author from the charge of pla|giari&s;m. And we may affirm, that if any epitome of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory de&s;erved well of the public in general, we would &s;ay this hi&s;tory of Al|tedus is it.

He had &s;ome warm di&s;putes with the mini&s;ter, Sam. des Marets, a theologian who referred every thing to &s;chola&s;tic learning, and who could not bear that theology &s;hould be guided by the Holy Scriptures and the fathers.

<P>The fir&s;t of this name, king of Jeru&s;alem in 1162, after the death of Baldwin III. his brother, when he &s;ucceeded him he was a young man of twenty-&s;even years of age, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many good qualities, and &s;ome great faults. Avarice induced him to undertake a war again&s;t Egypt, which was fortunate in the beginning, but very de&s;tructive in the end. He drove Gyraco twice out of Egypt, took Damietta, and might have taken Cairo with the &s;ame facility, if the fear that his army would have taken to them&s;elves the plunder of that city, had not induced him to attend to the &s;ultan's propo&s;als. The Mahomedan general informed of Amauri's mean pa&s;&s;ion, amu&s;ed him &s;o long under pretence of collecting two millions of gold for him, that he gained time for the army of Noradin to arrive, who forced him to rai&s;e the &s;iege. Amauri was obliged to return home, with the &s;hame of having lo&s;t his trouble, his honour, and the tribute the Egyptians had paid him. Saladin, &s;ucce&s;&s;or and nephew to Gyraco, united with Noradin, and pre&s;&s;ed the Chri&s;tians vigorou&s;ly. Amauri neglected nothing to break their mea&s;ures, and &s;upported by a powerful fleet belonging to the Greek emperor, he laid &s;iege to Damietta; but heavy rains and a fa|mine compelled him to rai&s;e the &s;iege. Meantime Saladin entered Pale&s;tine, took Gaza, and committed horrible ravages, while Noradin was doing the &s;ame at Antioch. Amauri, who was oppo&s;ing with an invincible courage the efforts of &s;o many enemies, was taken out of the world the 11th July, 1173, in the 38th year of his age.

into dangerous errors. He formed to him&s;elf a new &s;y&s;tem of religion, which, according to the Abb&eacute; Pluguet, he thus explained. Ari&s;totle &s;uppo&s;es that all beings are compo&s;ed of matter, which has in it&s;elf neither form nor &s;hape, this he calls the <HI>fir&s;t matter.</HI> This Amauri called God, becau&s;e it is a nece&s;&s;ary and infinite being. He acknow|ledged in God, three per&s;ons, Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, to whom he attributed the empire of the world, and whom he regarded as the object of religious wor&s;hip. But as this matter was endowed with a property of continual motion, it nece&s;&s;arily followed that this world mu&s;t &s;ome time have an end, and that all the beings therein mu&s;t return to that fir&s;t matter, which was the &s;upreme of all beings&mdash;the fir&s;t exi&s;t|ing, and the only one eternal. Religion, according to Amauri's opinion, had three epocha's, which bore a &s;imilitude to the reign of the three per&s;ons in the Trinity, the reign of God had exi&s;ted as long as the law of Mo&s;es. The reign of the Son would not always la&s;t; the ceremonies and &s;acrifices, which according to Amauri con&s;tituted the e&s;&s;ence of it, would not be eternal. A time would come when the &s;acra|ments &s;hould cea&s;e, and then the religion of the Holy Gho&s;t would begin, in which men would have no need of &s;acraments, and would render a &s;piritual wor&s;hip to the Supreme Being. This epocha was the reign of the Holy Gho&s;t, which according to Amauri was foretold by the &s;cripture, and which would &s;ucceed to the Chri&s;tian religion, as the Chri&s;|tian religon had &s;ucceeded to that of Mo&s;es. The Chri&s;tian religion therefore was the reign of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in the world, and every man under that law ought to look on him&s;elf as one of the members of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Amauri had many pro&s;elytes, and his opinions were condemned by Pope Innocent III. His di&s;ciples added other extravagances, as that the &s;acraments were u&s;ele&s;s, and that no action dictated by charity could be bad. They were condemned by the council of Paris in 1209, and many of them burned. Amauri appealed to the pope, who al&s;o condemned his doctrines: for fear of a rigorous puni&s;hment he retracted his opinions, retired to <HI>St. Martin des Champs,</HI> and died there of chagrin and di&s;ap|pointment.

<P>OF the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Amboi&s;e in France, &s;o called from their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;eignory of that name, was born in 1460. Being de&s;tined at a very early age for the church, he was elected bi&s;hop of Montauban when only fourteen. He was afterwards made one of the almoners to Lewis XI. to whom he behaved with great prudence. After the death of this prince in 1480, he entered into &s;ome of the intrigues of the court with a de&s;ign to favour the Duke of Orleans, with whom he was
<PB N="164" REF="182">
clo&s;ely connected; but tho&s;e intrigues being di&s;covered, D'Amboi&s;e and his protector were both impri&s;oned. The Duke of Orleans was at la&s;t re&s;tored to his liberty; and this prince having negociated the mar|riage of the king with the prince&s;s Anne of Britanny, acquired great reputation and credit at court. Of this his favourite D'Amboi&s;e felt the happy effects, for &s;oon after the archbi&s;hopric of Narbonne was be&s;towed on him. But as that was at too great a di&s;tance from the court, he changed it for that of Rouen, to which a chapter elected him in 1493. As &s;oon as he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new &s;ee, the Duke of Orleans, who was governor of Normandy, made him lieutenant-general, with the &s;ame power as if he had been governor in chief. This province was at that time in great di&s;order: the noble&s;&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed the people, the judges were all corrupted or intimidated; the &s;oldiers, who had been licentious &s;ince the late wars, infe&s;ted the high ways, plundering and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating all travellers they met. But in le&s;s than a year, D'Am|boi&s;e by his care and prudence, e&s;tabli&s;hed public tranquillity in the province committed to his care. The king dying in 1498, the Duke of Orleans a&s;cended the throne, by the name of Lewis XII. and D'Amboi&s;e became his prime mini&s;ter. By his fir&s;t operation in that office, he conciliated the affection of the whole nation. It had been a cu&s;tom when a new monarch a&s;cended the throne, to lay an extraordinary tax on the people, to defray the expences of the coronation, but by the coun&s;el of D'Amboi&s;e, this tax was not levied; and the im|po&s;ts were &s;oon reduced one tenth. His virtues coinciding with his knowledge, he made the French nation happy, and endeavoured to pre|&s;erve the glory they had acquired. By his advice Lewis XII. under|took the conque&s;t of the Milane&s;e in 1499. Lewis the Moor, uncle and va&s;&s;al of Maximilian, was then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that province. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> revolted &s;oon after the conque&s;t, but D'Amboi&s;e brought it back to its duty.

the marriage between Lewis XII. and Joan of France, to which he greatly contributed; and after he had procured for Cae&s;ar Borgia, &s;on of pope Alexander the VI. the dutchy of Valentinois, with a con&s;ider|able pen&s;ion. His ambition was to be pope, but he &s;aid only with a view to labour at the reform of abu&s;es, and the correction of manners. After the death of Pius III. he might have &s;ucceeded in his wi&s;hes, if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as much cunning as the Italian cardinals. He took mea|&s;ures to procure the tiara, but Cardinal Julian de Rovera (afterwards Julius II.) found means to circumvent him. The Venetians had contributed greatly to his exclu&s;ion; he therefore took the fir&s;t op|portunity to excite Lewis XII. to make war on them. This celebrated cardinal died in 1510, in the convent of the Cele&s;tines at Lyons, of the gout in his &s;tomach, aged 50 years. They &s;ay that he often repeated to the friar who attended him in his illne&s;s, "<HI>Brother John, why have I not during my whole life, been brother John?</HI>" This mini&s;ter has been greatly prai&s;ed for having laboured for the happine&s;s of France; but he has been much cen&s;ured for having advi&s;ed his ma&s;ter to &s;ign the treaty of Blois, in 1504, by which France ran the ri&s;k of being di&s;|membered. He governed both the king and the &s;tate; laborious, kind, hone&s;t, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed good &s;en&s;e, firmne&s;s, and experience: but he was not a great genius, nor were his views exten&s;ive. The de&s;ire he had to ea&s;e the people in their taxes, procured him during his life, but much more after his death, the title of Father of the People. He merited this title &s;till more, by the care he took to reform the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. Mo&s;t of the judges were venal, and permitted them&s;elves either to be corrupted or intimidated; the poor, and tho&s;e who had no &s;upport, could never obtain ju&s;tice, when their oppo&s;ers were either powerful or rich. Another evil not le&s;s enormous troubled the king|dom; law-&s;uits were &s;pun out to &s;uch a length, were &s;o expen&s;ive, and accompanied by &s;o much trick and chicanery, that mo&s;t people rather cho&s;e to abandon their right, than engage in the recovery of them by &s;uits which had no pro&s;pect of coming to an end. D'Amboi&s;e re&s;olved to remedy this abu&s;e. He called to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance many lawyers and civilians, the mo&s;t learned and of the greate&s;t integrity; and charged them to form a plan, by which ju&s;tice might be admini&s;tered without partiality, the duration of law-&s;uits abridged and rendered le&s;s ruinous; and al&s;o to prevent the corruption of the judges. When the&s;e commi&s;|&s;ioners had made their report, D'Amboi&s;e undertook the laborious ta&s;k of examining into the changes they had propo&s;ed in the old laws, and the new regulations they de&s;igned to e&s;tabli&s;h; and after having made &s;ome changes, the&s;e new regulations were publi&s;hed throughout the king|dom. As he was governor of Normandy, he made a progre&s;s through that

<HEAD>AMBROSE (ST).</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t eminent fathers of the Chri&s;tian church in the fourth century, born in Gaul, while his father was <HI>Praefectus praetorio</HI> of that province. The birth of Saint Ambro&s;e is &s;aid to have been fol|lowed with a remarkable pre&s;age of his future eloquence, for we are told that a &s;warm of bees came and &s;ettled upon his mouth, as he lay in his cradle. He &s;oon made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;everal parts of &s;ecular learning, and pleaded cau&s;es before Probus with &s;o much eloquence, that he was appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and &s;oon after governor of the provinces of Liguria and Emilia. He &s;ettled at Milan, where, in the year 374, upon the death of Auxentius bi&s;hop of that city, there being a great conte&s;t between the Catholics and Arians concerning the choice of a new bi&s;hop, Ambro&s;e thought it his duty as governor to go to church, in order to compo&s;e the tumult. He accordingly addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the people, in a gentle pathetic &s;peech, exhort|ing them to proceed in their choice in a calm and friendly manner; while he was &s;peaking to them, the whole a&s;&s;embly cried out "Let Ambro&s;e be bi&s;hop." Such a &s;udden and unexpected incident &s;ur|pri&s;ed him exceedingly, &s;o that he retired immediately, and u&s;ed every method to divert them from their re&s;olution of choo&s;ing him; but at la&s;t
<PB N="167" REF="185">
he was obliged to comply, and was baptized; being before only a ca|techumen, and ordained bi&s;hop towards the latter end of the year 374. About the year 377, the barbarous nations making an incur&s;ion into the Roman empire, he fled to Illyricum, and afterwards to Rome. In the year 384, he was &s;ent to the tyrant Maximus, who had u&s;urped the empire, and prevailed upon him not to pa&s;s into Italy. The heathens encouraged by the&s;e inte&s;tine commotions in the empire, attempted to re&s;tore their religion, and employed Aurelius Symmachus, a man of great eloquence to plead their cau&s;e. But Symmachus having lo&s;t his cau&s;e, was expelled the city, and commanded not to approach within an hundred miles of it. The petition which he pre&s;ented to the Emperor Valentinian the younger, is &s;till extant. St. Ambro&s;e wrote a confutation of this petition. St. Ambro&s;e met with great op|po&s;ition from the Arians, again&s;t whom he acted with great &s;pirit and intrepidity. Ju&s;tinia, the empre&s;s, and mother of Valentinian, who was an Arian, and de&s;irous to re&s;tore that religion in Milan, demanded of St. Ambro&s;e one of the churches there, which he refu&s;ed, and the people taking his part, &s;he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t, and even to a&s;k his in|tere&s;t with the people to pacify them.</P>
<P>Ambro&s;e was &s;ent a &s;econd time to the tyrant Maximus; for Va|lentinian found no per&s;on &s;o proper to negociate with him. He &s;poke to him with great courage and boldne&s;s, but could obtain nothing; for Maximus &s;oon after marched into Italy, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the we&s;tern empire; &s;o that Valentinian was obliged to retire with his mother Ju&s;tinia and his &s;i&s;ter Galla, to The&s;&s;alonica in Illyricum, in order to de&s;ire Theodo&s;ius's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who defeated Maximus, and re&s;tored Valentinian to the empire.</P>
<P>While Theodo&s;ius continued in Italy, after the defeat of Maximus, an in&s;urrection happened at The&s;&s;alonica, in which &s;everal of the ma|gi&s;trates were &s;toned, and their bodies dragged along the &s;treets. Theo|do&s;ius being informed of this, ra&s;hly commanded a certain number to be put to death promi&s;cuou&s;ly; by which means the city was filled with the blood of many innocent per&s;ons, and among&s;t the re&s;t &s;everal &s;trangers, who had but ju&s;t come there: no regard was paid to any di&s;|tinction of per&s;ons, no form of trial was ob&s;erved, but they were cut down like corn in the harve&s;t, as Theodoret expre&s;&s;es it, to the number of 7000. At this time an a&s;&s;embly of bi&s;hops was held at Milan, who all expre&s;&s;ed an abhorrence of &s;uch cruelty in the emperor Ambro&s;e wrote a letter to him, in which he repre&s;ented the enormity of his crime, and exhorted him to make &s;atisfaction, by a &s;incere &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re|pentance. Some time after Theodo&s;ius coming to Milan, went to re|ceive the &s;acrament at the great church; where Ambro&s;e meeting him at
<PB N="168" REF="186">
the door, denied him entrance, and repre&s;ented his guilt in the mo&s;t forcible and pathetic terms. The emperor was &s;truck with his words, and with great unea&s;ine&s;s of mind returned to his palace: but about a year after, Ambro&s;e being convinced of the &s;incerity of his repentance, admitted him into the church. In 392, Valentinian the emperor being a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the contrivance of Argoba&s;tes, and Eugenius u&s;urping the empire, Ambro&s;e was obliged to leave Milan, but he returned the year following, after Eugenius was defeated.</P>
<P>He died at Milan the 4th of April, 397; being 57 years of age, ac|cording to M. Du Pin, and &s;ome other writers; but Dr. Cave and Olearius &s;ay that he was 64 years old at his death. He was buried in the great church at Milan. He wrote &s;everal works, the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable of which is that De Officiis. He is conci&s;e and &s;ententious in his manner of writing, and full of turns of wit; his terms are well cho&s;en, and his expre&s;&s;ions noble; he diver&s;ifies his &s;ubject by an admirable co|piou&s;ne&s;s of thoughts and language: he is very ingenious in giving an ea&s;y and natural turn to every thing which he treats of, and is not with|out &s;trength and pathos when there is occa&s;ion for it. This is the character which Du Pin gives him as a writer; but Era&s;mus ob&s;erves, that he has many quaint and affected &s;entences, and frequently very ob&s;cure ones; and it is certain that his writings are intermixed with many &s;trange and peculiar opinions. Paulinus wrote his life, and dedicated it to St. Au|gu&s;tin: this life is prefixed to St. Ambro&s;e's works, the be&s;t edition of which is reckoned to be that publi&s;hed by the Benedictine monks, in two volumes in folio, at Paris, in 1686 and 1690.</P>

<HEAD>AMERICUS VESPUTIUS,</HEAD>
<P>BORN at Florence, of a very ancient family in 1451. He di&s;covered very early a ta&s;te for philo&s;ophy, mathematics, and &s;ea-voyages. As &s;oon as he was informed of Columbus's return from the di&s;covery of the We&s;t Indies, he burned with impatience to be partaker of his glory. He applied to Ferdinand king of Spain, who &s;upplied him with four &s;hips, with which he departed from Cadiz in 1497. He fell in with the coa&s;t of Paria, and ran along it, and al&s;o the coa&s;t of Terra Firma, as far as the gulph of Mexico, returning to Spain in about eighteen months. He did not di&s;pute with Columbus the glory of having di&s;covered the We&s;t India i&s;lands; but pretended that he fir&s;t di&s;covered the continent of America. For this the Spani&s;h writers are very &s;evere, and charge him with having fal&s;ified dates to &s;upport his claim. A year after his fir&s;t voyage, Ve&s;putius performed a &s;econd with &s;ix &s;hips, &s;till under the au&s;pices of Ferdinand and I&s;abella. In this voyage he proceeded to the Antilla i&s;lands, and from thence to the coa&s;t of Guiana and

Vennezuela, and returned &s;afe to Cadiz, in the month of November 1500; bringing with him many valuable &s;tones, and other commodities. He met with but a cool reception from the Spaniards for all his &s;ervices, and their ingratitude &s;en&s;ibly affected him. Emanuel king of Portugal, jealous of the &s;ucce&s;s of the catholic &s;overeign, had taken great pains to &s;hare in the new di&s;coveries: and being informed of Ve&s;putius's di&s;con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nt, invited him to Portugal, and gave him the command of three &s;hips to undertake a third voyage on di&s;covery. Ve&s;putius &s;ailed from Li&s;bon in May 1501. He ran down the coa&s;t of Africa as far as Sierra Leon, and the coa&s;t of Angola. He then &s;tood over for the coa&s;t of America, and fell in with Brazil, which he di&s;covered entirely, &s;outh as far as Patagonia, and north to the river of Plata. This illu&s;trious navigator then &s;ailed back to Sierra Leon, and keeping along the coa&s;t of Guinea, returned to Portugal, arriving at Li&s;bon in September, 1502. King Emanuel highly &s;atisfied with this &s;ucce&s;s, equipped &s;ix &s;hips, with which our navigator made a fourth voyage. In this voyage he de&s;igned to &s;tand along the coa&s;t of America to the &s;outh, until he di&s;|covered a pa&s;&s;age to the Molucca I&s;lands to the we&s;tward.

<HEAD>AMHURST (NICHOLAS).</HEAD>
<P>A MAN who has been greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed as a poet, and a poeti|cal writer of the pre&s;ent century, was &s;o much talked of for a time, and &s;o clo&s;ely connected with the leaders of the grand oppo&s;ition to Sir Ro|bert Walpole's admini&s;tration, that, although we have but few materials with regard to the circum&s;tances of his life, he cannot be entirely omit|ted. He was born at Marden in Kent, but in what year is uncertain. Under the protection and care of his grandfather, who was a clergyman, he received his grammatical education at merchant-taylor's &s;chool, in London; and from thence was removed to St. John's college, Oxford, where his behaviour was &s;uch as occa&s;ioned his expul&s;ion. What the par|ticular and &s;pecific charges again&s;t him were, we are not informed; but in general, he is &s;aid to have been expelled for the libertini&s;m of his principles, the irregularity of his conduct, and &s;ome offence which he had given to the heads of the college. From his own account of the matter, in the dedication of his poems to Dr. Delaune, pre&s;ident of St. John's, and in his Terrae Filius, we may collect that he wi&s;hed to have it under&s;tood, he was &s;olely per&s;ecuted for the liberality of his &s;enti|ments, and his attachment to the cau&s;e of the Revolution, and of the Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but he had probably been guilty of real mi&s;beha|viour. Whatever were the cau&s;es of his expul&s;ion, his re&s;entment on the account of it was very great. He made it therefore his bu&s;ine&s;s to fatirize the learning and di&s;cipline of the univer&s;ity of Oxford, and to expo&s;e the characters of &s;everal gentlemen who were deemed a part of its mo&s;t re&s;pectable members. This he did in a poem, which he called Oculus Britanniae, and again in his Terrae Filius, a work in
<PB N="173" REF="191">
which there is a con&s;iderable portion of wit, intermixed with much abu&s;e and &s;currility. Soon after Mr. Amhur&s;t quitted Oxford, he &s;eems to have &s;ettled in London as a writer by profe&s;&s;ion. He publi&s;hed a volume of mi&s;cellanies, which had principally been written at the uni|ver&s;ity. The mi&s;cellanies are upon a variety of &s;ubjects, both &s;acred and profane. They are partly originals, and partly paraphra&s;es, imi|tations, and tran&s;lations; and con&s;i&s;t of tales, epigrams, epi&s;tles, love ver&s;es, elegies, and &s;atires. They begin with a beautiful paraphra&s;e on the Mo&s;aic account of the creation, and with a very humorous tale on the di&s;covery of that u&s;eful uten&s;il a bottle-&s;crew. Mr. Amhur&s;t was the author likewi&s;e of an epi&s;tle to Sir John Blount, Bart. one of the South-Sea company in 1720; of the Briti&s;h General, a poem &s;acred to the memory of his Grace John Duke of Marlborough; and of Strephon's revenge, a &s;atire on the Oxford toa&s;ts. Our poet, who had a great enmity to the exorbitant demands and domineering &s;pirit of the high church clergy, and who had early at Oxford di&s;played his zeal again&s;t prie&s;tly power, di&s;covered this particularly in a poem, en|titled the Convocation, in five cantos; which is a kind of &s;atire again&s;t all the writers who had oppo&s;ed the bi&s;hop Hoadley, in the famous Bangorian controver&s;y. He tran&s;lated al&s;o Mr. Addi&s;on's Re&s;urrection, and &s;ome other of his Latin poems. But his principal literary under|taking, was conducting the celebrated political paper called the Craft&s;|man, which was written again&s;t Sir Robert Walpole's mini&s;try, and was carried on for a number of years with great &s;pirit and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This paper was more read and attended to than any production of the kind which had hitherto been publi&s;hed in England. Ten or twelve thou&s;and were &s;old in a day; and the effect which it had in rai&s;ing the indignation of the people, and in controlling the power of admini&s;tra|tion, was very con&s;iderable. This effect was not entirely, or chiefly, owing to the abilities of Mr. Amhur&s;t. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Lord Bolin|broke, and Mr. Pulteney, and probably by other leaders of the oppo&s;i|tion. Their fame, and their writings were the grand &s;upport of the Craft&s;man. Neverthele&s;s Mr. Amhur&s;t's own papers are allowed to have been compo&s;ed with ability and &s;pirit; and he conducted the Craft&s;man, in the very zenith of its pro&s;perity, with no &s;mall reputation to him&s;elf. On the 2d of July 1737, there appeared in that publica|tion an ironical letter, written in the name of Colley Cibber, the de&s;ign of which was to ridicule the act which had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed for licen&s;ing plays. In this letter the laureat propo&s;es him&s;elf to the lord chamberlain to be made &s;uperintendant of the old plays, as &s;tanding equally in need of correction with the new ones; and produces &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages from Shake&s;peare, and other poets, in relation to kings, queens, princes,
<PB N="174" REF="192">
and mini&s;ters of &s;tate, which, he &s;ays, are now fit to be brought on the &s;tage. The printer, &amp;c. having been taken up, by order of government, Mr. Amhur&s;t voluntarily &s;urrendered him&s;elf in their &s;tead, and after having been kept in cu&s;tody ten days, was obliged to bring his habeas corpus for his liberty before he could obtain it, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to give bail for his good behaviour, as well as his appearance. The mi|ni&s;try, we believe prudently, dropped the pro&s;ecution. Notwith&s;tand|ing Mr. Amhur&s;t's merit with his party, he was totally neglected by them, when they made their terms with the crown; and he died &s;oon after, of a fever, at Twickenham. His death happened on the 27th of April, 1742; his di&s;order was probably occa&s;ioned, in a great mea&s;ure, by the ill u&s;age he had received. Mr. Ralph, in his Ca&s;e of Authors, &s;peaks with a ju&s;t feeling and indignation upon the &s;ubject. "Poor Amhur&s;t! after having been the drudge of his party, for the be&s;t part of twenty years, was as much forgotten in the famous compromi&s;e of 1742, as if he had never been born! and died of what is called a broken heart, which happened a few months afterwards; he was indebted to the charity of a book&s;eller for a grave; not to be traced now, becau&s;e then no otherwi&s;e to be di&s;tingui&s;hed than by the fre&s;hne&s;s of a turf, bor|rowed from the next common to cover it." A very late writer, in the character of Mr. Pulteney, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf concerning the treatment of Mr. Amhur&s;t in the following terms. "But if the Earl of Bath had his li&s;t of pen&s;ioners, how comes it that Amhur&s;t was forgotten? The fate of this poor man is &s;ingular. He was the able a&s;&s;ociate of Bolinbroke and Pulteney, in writing the celebrated weekly paper, called The Craft&s;man. His abilities were unque&s;tionable: he had almo&s;t as much wit, learning, and various knowledge, as his two partners; and when the&s;e great ma&s;ters cho&s;e not to appear in public them&s;elves, he &s;upplied their places &s;o well, that his e&s;&s;ays were often a&s;cribed to them."</P>

for in&s;truction in the French language, which when he had obtained, he returned again to Mr. Chadwick. At Lady-day 1717, he, with his &s;chool-fellow, Mr. Towgood, who has &s;ince made &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a figure among the di&s;&s;enters, were put under Mr. James and Mr. Grove, who had been long employed before the &s;chi&s;m bill, in educating young men for the mini&s;try, but had de&s;i&s;ted from that employment, until George the Fir&s;t was firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed on the throne. Under the&s;e gentlemen Mr. Amory went through his learning, and in 1722 was examined and approved of as a candidate for the mini&s;try. The u&s;ual examination for the di&s;&s;enting mini&s;ters, is to deliver a &s;ermon, maintain a the&s;is, and &s;ub|mit to &s;uch other exerci&s;es as are thought proper.

Mr. Darch, of Hall-bi&s;hops. He al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted his uncle Mr. Grove, in the in&s;truction of the pupils, in the room of Mr. James: this employment he di&s;charged with the greate&s;t ability and diligence.

In the year 1741 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e married the daughter of the Rev. Mr. Baker, a diffencing mini&s;ter near London; a woman of an excellent di&s;po&s;ition, with whom he lived in the greate&s;t happine&s;s.

<P>His conduct, in a di&s;pute which the Bapti&s;t &s;ociety in Taunton had with their pa&s;tor, reflects high honour upon him.

In 1759, he was induced to quit Taunton, and remove to London, to a&s;&s;i&s;t as afternoon preacher at the meeting in the Old Jury, belonging to the learned Dr. Chandler.

and he was too liberal in his &s;entiments to plea&s;e the bigots and en|thu&s;ia&s;ts. He had, however, the happine&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s the e&s;teem of the mo&s;t judicious part of the di&s;&s;enters. In 1767, he was cho&s;en one of the tru&s;tees to Dr. Williams' charities, and next year the univer&s;ity of Edinburgh conferred on him the degree of doctor in divinity; and the &s;ame year he was elected a lecturer at Salters Hall. He had been &s;ome time before cho&s;en pa&s;tor of the &s;ociety at the Old Jury, jointly with Mr. White. Here he continued until his decea&s;e.

In 1772, when the di&s;&s;enting mi|ni&s;ters had formed a de&s;ign to procure an enlargement of the tolera|tion act, Dr. Amory was one of the committee, and extremely zealous in the &s;cheme, being convinced in his mind of the natural ju&s;tice of the mea&s;ure. He continued indefatigable in the &s;ervice of the di&s;&s;enters until the la&s;t, and expired on the 24th of July 1774, in the 74th year of his age.</P>
<P>Dr. Amory was an excellent man in every point of view.&mdash;A ratio|nal and fervent piety, and enlarged &s;entiments of the divine providence, eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed him; none could excel him as a ma&s;ter, a hu&s;band, a father, or a friend. As a companion, he was remarkably plea&s;ing and engaging; and the whole of his private life was &s;ingularly amiable.</P>
<P>In public, as a clergyman, he was greatly re&s;pected; he conducted the public wor&s;hip with admirable propriety. His di&s;cour&s;es were &s;olid and affectionate. He was peculiarly fond of dwelling on the providence and perfections of the Deity, the love and obedience we owe him, the evidences of a future &s;tate, the excellency of the Go&s;pel, and the duties of a Chri&s;tian life. He &s;eldom entered on any di&s;puted point, if he did, it was to expo&s;e Calvini&s;m, of which he much di&s;approved. His &s;entiments of religion coincided with Dr. Samuel Clarke. His learning was &s;olid and exten&s;ive. He diligently &s;tudied the &s;cripture, and was well acquainted with theology, ethics, experi|mental philo&s;ophy, and the writings of the ancients. The following is an account of his works:&mdash;1. a Letter to a Friend, publi&s;hed in the Literary Journal, 1731.&mdash;2. A Dialogue on Devotion, after the manner of Xenophon.&mdash;3. Forms of Devotion for the clo&s;et, 8vo, 1763.&mdash; 4. An Account of the Life of Dr. Groves, from which the life in the Biographia Britannica is taken.&mdash;5. A preface to Dr. Groves's &s;ermons.

<P>BISHOP of Auxerre and great almoner of France, one of the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> celebrated men for learning of the &s;ixteenth century. He was born at Melun, the 30th of October, 1514, and &s;tudied philo&s;ophy at Paris, in the college of cardinal Le Moine. He was naturally dull and heavy, but his diligence and application made amends for the&s;e natural defects. Having taken his degree of ma&s;ter of arts at the age of nineteen, he pur&s;ued his &s;tudies under the royal profe&s;&s;ors e&s;tabli&s;hed by Francis I. viz. James Tu&s;en, who explained the Greek poets; Peter Dones, profe&s;&s;or of rhetoric; and O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">once Fin&eacute;, profe&s;&s;or of mathematics. He left Paris at the age of twenty-three, and went to Bourges with the Sien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Colin, who had the abbey of St. Ambro&s;e in that city. At the recom|mendation of this abbot, a &s;ecretary of &s;tate took Amyot into his hou&s;e, to be tutor to his children. The great improvements they made under his direction, induced the &s;ecretary to recommend him to the prince&s;s Margaret, duche&s;s of Berry, only &s;i&s;ter of Francis I. and by means of this recommendation Amyot was made public profe&s;&s;or of Greek and Latin in the univer&s;ity of Bourges: he read two lectures a day, for ten years, a Latin lecture in the morning, and a Greek one in the afternoon. It was during this time he tran&s;lated into French the Amours of Thea|genes and Chariclea, which Francis I. was &s;o plea&s;ed with, that he conferred upon him the abbey of Bello&s;ane. The death of this prince happening &s;oon after, Amyot thought it would be better to try his for|tune el&s;ewhere, than to expect any preferment at the court of France; he therefore accompanied Morvillier to Venice, on his emba&s;&s;y from Henry II. to that republic. When Morvillier was recalled from hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> emba&s;&s;y, Amyot would not repa&s;s the Alps with him, choo&s;ing rather to go to Rome, where he was kindly received by the bi&s;hop of Mirepoix, at who&s;e hou&s;e he lived two years. It was here, that, looking over the manu&s;cripts of the Vatican (whither he was allowed a free acce&s;s by Romulus Ama&s;eiis, keeper of that famous library), he di&s;covered that Heliodorus, bi&s;hop of Tricca, was the author of the Amours of Thea|genes. He found al&s;o a manu&s;cript of this work, more correct and complete than that which he had tran&s;lated, and took care to enable him&s;elf thereby to give a better edition of this work. His la|bours, however, in this way did not engage him &s;o as to divert him from pu&s;hing his fortune: he in&s;inuated him&s;elf &s;o far into the favour of car|dinal de Tournon, that the cardinal recommended him to the king, to to be preceptor to his two younger &s;ons. While he was in this employ|ment, he fini&s;hed his tran&s;lation of Plutarch's Lives, which he dedicated to

the king: he afterwards undertook that of Plutarch's Morals, which he ended in the reign of Charles IX. and dedicated to that prince. Charles conferred upon him the abbey of St. Cornelius de Compiegne, and made him great almoner of France and bi&s;hop of Auxerre; and that of curator of the univer&s;ity of Paris happening to be vacant at the &s;ame time, he was al&s;o inve&s;ted in both the&s;e employments, which Thuanus greatly complains of. Henry III. perhaps would have yielded to the pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations of the bi&s;hop of St. Flour, who had attended him on his journey into Poland, and made great intere&s;t for the po&s;t of great almoner; but the duche&s;s of Savoy, the king's aunt, recommend|ed Amyot &s;o earne&s;tly to him, when he pa&s;&s;ed through Turin, on his return from Poland, that he was not only continued in his employment, but a new honour was added to it for his &s;ake, for when Henry III. named Amyot commander of the order of the Holy Gho&s;t, he decreed at the &s;ame time, as a mark of re&s;pect to him, all the great almoners of France &s;hould be of cour&s;e commanders of that order.

<HEAD>AMYRAUT (MOSES),</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent French divine, mini&s;ter and profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Saumur. He was born in September 1596, at Bourgueil, a &s;mall town of Touraine, of an ancient family originally from Orleans. Hav|ing gone through his cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy, he was &s;ent to Poictiers, to read law, to which he applied him&s;elf with great a&s;&s;iduity, and is &s;aid to have &s;pent fourteen hours a day in that &s;tudy. At the end of his fir&s;t year, he took his degree of licentiate. But Mr. Bouchereau, mini&s;ter of Saumur, having advi&s;ed him to &s;tudy divinity, and the reading of Calvin's In&s;titutions having &s;trongly inclined him to follow this advice, he acquainted his father that he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be a clergyman, and obtained his a&s;&s;ent, though not without a great deal of difficulty. He went to &s;tudy at Saumur, where he continued a con|&s;iderable time as &s;tudent of divinity. Upon his admi&s;&s;ion into orders, he was pre&s;ented to the church of St. Agnau, in the country of Mayne, where, after having lived eighteen months, he was invited to Saumur, to &s;ucceed Mr. Daille, appointed mini&s;ter of Charenton. About the &s;ame time that the church of Saumur de&s;ired him for their mini&s;ter, the academic council fixed upon him for profe&s;&s;or of divinity. His admi&s;|&s;ion to the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, with his previous examination, and his in|augural the&s;is De Sacerdotio Chri&s;ti, redounded much to his reputation.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="198">In 1613, Mr. Amyraut was &s;ent deputy to the national council at Charenton; and by this a&s;&s;embly was appointed to addre&s;s the king, and lay before his maje&s;ty their complaints concerning the infraction of the edicts: he was particularly charged not to deliver his &s;peech upon his knees, as the deputies for the former national &s;ynod had done. He managed this affair with &s;o much addre&s;s, that he was introduced to the king according to the ancient cu&s;tom, and in the manner that was agreeable to the a&s;&s;embly. It was on this occa&s;ion that he became ac|quainted with cardinal Richlieu, who conceived a great e&s;teem for him. About this time he publi&s;hed a piece, wherein he explained the my&s;tery of prede&s;tination and grace, according to the hypothe&s;is of Camero, which occa&s;ioned a kind of civil war among&s;t the prote&s;tant divines of France. Tho&s;e who di&s;liked the hypothe&s;is, derided it as a novelty, e&s;pecially when they &s;aw them&s;elves joined by the great Du Moulin, who accu&s;ed Amyraut of Ariani&s;m. The authority of this famous divine, to whom the people paid a great re&s;pect and veneration, on account of the many books of controver&s;y he had publi&s;hed, made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion in the minds of many mini&s;ters, that, though Mr. Amyraut had publi&s;hed a piece, wherein he maintained that Calvin had held univer&s;al grace, yet many deputies at the national &s;ynod of Alencon came charged with in&s;tructions again&s;t him, and &s;ome were even for depo&s;ing him. The deputies of the provinces beyond the Loire were the mo&s;t violent again&s;t him: however, the &s;ynod, after having heard Mr. Amyraut explain his opinion, in &s;everal &s;e&s;&s;ions, and an&s;wer the objections made thereto, honourably acquitted him, and enjoined &s;ilence in re&s;pect to que&s;tions of this nature: but this was not ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by either &s;ide, for complaints were made again&s;t Mr. Amyraut, in the national &s;ynod of Charenton, for having acted con|trary to the regulations concerning that &s;ilence; and he, in his turn, complained of infractions of the &s;ame nature. The a&s;&s;embly, by an holy amne&s;ty, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the&s;e mutual complaints, and having renew|ed the injunction of &s;ilence, &s;ent back Amyraut to his employment, and permitted him to oppo&s;e foreigners who &s;hould attack him, in what manner the &s;ynod of Anjou &s;hould think proper. This &s;ynod allowed him to publi&s;h an an&s;wer to the three volumes of Span|hemius upon univer&s;al grace, which occa&s;ioned the writing of &s;everal others.</P>
<P>When the national &s;ynod was &s;itting in the year 1645, Mr. Amyraut was de&s;ired to enter into a conference with Mr. De la Milletiere, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> order to bring him over to his opinion: the conference continued &s;everal days, but they could no more agree in verbal di&s;putation than in their writings. The doctrine of Mr. De la Place, concerning
<PB N="181" REF="199">
original &s;in, being attacked in this &s;ynod, Mr. Amyraut appeared be|fore the a&s;&s;embly to plead the cau&s;e of his colleague; and he made it appear, that the doctrine complained of, was no ways dangerous. His conduct in this affair was highly commended on account of the excellent defence he made in favour of Mr. De la Place's opinion, and becau&s;e he had no other motive than the intere&s;t of his colleague; his own opinion as to original &s;in being different from that of Mr. De la Place. Amyraut being a man well acquainted with the world, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very entertaining in conver&s;ation, which contributed no le&s;s than the reputation of his learning to render him e&s;teemed by &s;o many per&s;ons of quality, though of oppo&s;ite principles in religious matters: among tho&s;e who particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him, were the mar&s;hals De Brez&eacute; and De la Meilleraic, Mr. Le Goux de la Berchere, fir&s;t pre&s;ident of the parliament of Burgundy, and cardinal Mazarin. What gained him the favour of this cardinal, was, in all probability, his openly de|claring in favour of the obedience due to &s;overeigns, which proved very advantageous to the court of France during the troubles of the league again&s;t cardinal Mazarin, called de la Fronde. In his apology, publi&s;hed in 1647, in behalf of the prote&s;tants, he excu&s;es, as well as he can, the civil wars of France; but he declares at the &s;ame time, that he by no means intends to ju&s;tify the taking up of arms again&s;t one's lawful &s;overeign upon any pretence what&s;oever; and that he always looked upon it as more agreeable to the nature of the go&s;pel, and the practice of the primitive church, to u&s;e no other arms but patience, tears, and prayers. But notwith&s;tanding his attachment to this doc|trine, he was not for obeying in matters of con&s;cience, which plainly appeared, when the &s;ene&s;chal of Saumur imparted to him an order from the council of &s;tate, enjoining all tho&s;e of the reformed religion to hang the out&s;ide of their hou&s;es on corpus Chri&s;ti day. The &s;ene&s;|chal notified this order to him the eve of this holiday, entreating him at the &s;ame time to per&s;uade the prote&s;tants to comply with it. To this Mr. Amyraut made an&s;wer, that, on the contrary, he would go directly and exhort his pari&s;hioners not to comply with it, as he him&s;elf was re&s;olved not to obey &s;uch orders; that in all his &s;ermons he had en|deavoured to in&s;pire his hearers with obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to &s;uperior powers, but not when their con&s;ciences were concerned. Having thus acquainted the &s;ene&s;chal with his re&s;olution, he went from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, laying before his pari&s;hioners the rea&s;ons why he thought they ought not to obey the order of the council. The king's lieutenant, however, not thinking it proper to &s;upport the &s;ene&s;chal, this prevented any tumult on that occa&s;ion. Amyraut was a man of &s;uch charity and compa&s;&s;ion, that he be&s;towed on the poor his whole

&s;alary during the la&s;t ten years of his life, without di&s;tinction of catholic or prote&s;tant. He died the 8th of February, in 1664, and was inter|red with the u&s;ual ceremonies of the academy.</P>

<HEAD>ANACREON.</HEAD>
<P>A GREEK poet, born at Teos, a &s;ea-port of Ionia. Madam Dacier endeavours to prove, from Plato, that he was a kin&s;man of Solon's, and con&s;equently allied to the Codridae, the noble&s;t family in Athens; but this is not &s;ufficiently &s;upported. The time when he flouri&s;hed is uncertain; Eu&s;ebius placing it in the 62d, Suidas in the 52d, and Mr. Le Fevre in the 72d Olympiad. He is &s;aid to have been eighteen years of age when Harpagus, the general of Cyrus, came with an army again&s;t the confederate cities of the Ionians and Aeolians. The Mile&s;ians immediately &s;ubmitted them&s;elves; but the Phocaeans, when they found they were unable to with&s;tand the enemy, cho&s;e rather to abandon their country than their liberty, and getting a fleet to|gether, tran&s;ported them&s;elves and families to the coa&s;t of France, where being ho&s;pitably received by Nannus the king of the country, they built Mar&s;eilles. The Teians &s;oon followed their example; for Har|pagus having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of their walls, they unanimou&s;ly went on board their &s;hips, and &s;ailing to Thrace, fixed them&s;elves in the city Abdera; where they had not been long, when the Thracians, jealous of their neighbours, endeavoured to give them di&s;turbance; and in the&s;e conflicts it &s;eems to be, that Anacreon lo&s;t tho&s;e friends whom he celebrates in his epigrams. This poet had certainly a delicate wit, as may be judged from the many beauties which &s;hine throughout his works; but he was rather too fond of plea&s;ures, for love and wine had the di&s;po&s;al of all his hours.</P>
<P>Anacreon left Abdera, and went to the court of Polycrates at Samo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, where he was received with great marks of friend&s;hip; and it was here he became enamoured with the hand&s;ome Bathyllus.</P>
<P>He had another favourite, named Smerdias, the &s;on of a Thracian prince, who had been given as a pre&s;ent to Polycrates by &s;ome Grecian pirates.</P>
<P>He is &s;aid to have been in love with the fair Cleobulus, whom he had like to have killed when a child, in the arms of his nur&s;e, by rudely jo&s;tling her as he reeled one day through the &s;treets, when he was in liquor; and not content with this, he abu&s;ed the child with &s;cur|rilous language: the nur&s;e w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">hed he might one day commend him as much as he had the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> abu&s;ed him. Her wi&s;hes were fulfilled, for Cleo|bulus grew to be a beautiful youth, and Anacreon falling in love with
<PB N="183" REF="201">
him, wrote &s;everal ver&s;es in his prai&s;e. Aelian has endeavoured to clear Anacreon of the &s;u&s;picion of entertaining any di&s;honourable pa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e youths; but the general charge again&s;t him in this re&s;pect is &s;o &s;trong that the imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tation lies heavy upon his memory. How long Anacreon continued at Samos is uncertain, but it is probable he remain|ed there during the greate&s;t part of the reign of Polycrates, which &s;eems to be confirmed by Herodotus, who a&s;&s;ures us, that Anacreon was with that prince in his chamber when he received a me&s;&s;age from Oraetes governor of Sardys, by who&s;e treachery Polycrates was &s;oon after be|trayed and inhumanly crucified. It &s;eems to have been a little before this that Anacreon left Samos and removed to Athens, having been invited thither by Hipparchus the elde&s;t &s;on of Pi&s;i&s;tratus, one of the mo&s;t vir|tuous and learned princes of his time, who, as Plato a&s;&s;ures us, &s;ent an obliging letter, with a ve&s;&s;el of fifty oars to convey him over the Aegean &s;ea. After Hipparchus was &s;lain by the con&s;piracy of Harmodius and Ari&s;togiton, Anacreon returned to Teos, where he remained till the re|volt of Hi&s;tiaeus, when he was obliged once more to remove to Abdera, where he died. The manner of his death is &s;aid to have been very ex|traordinary, for they tell us that he was choaked with a grape-&s;tone, which he &s;wallowed as he was regaling on &s;ome new wine.</P>
<P>There is but a &s;mall part of Anacreon's works which remain. Be&s;ides his odes and epigrams, he compo&s;ed elegies, hymns, and iambics. His poems which are extant con&s;i&s;t chiefly of Bacchanalian &s;ongs and love-&s;onnets. How much he was the delight of both ancients and modern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> appears from the prai&s;es they have be&s;towed upon him.</P>
<P>The ver&s;es of Anacreon, &s;ays Scaliger, are &s;weeter than Indian &s;ugar. His beauty, &s;ays Madam Dacier, and chiefe&s;t excellence lay in imitating nature, and in following rea&s;on, &s;o that he pre&s;ented to the mind no images but what were noble and natural. The odes of Anacreon, &s;ays Rapin, are flowers, beauties, and perpetual graces; it is familiar to him to write what is natural, and to the life, he having an air &s;o delicate, &s;o ea&s;y, and &s;o graceful, that among all the ancients there is nothing comparable to the method he took, nor to that kind of writing he followed. He flows &s;oft and ea&s;y, every where diffu&s;ing the joy and indolence of his mind through his ver&s;e, and tuning his harp to the &s;mooth and plea&s;ant temper of his &s;oul</P>

He went to Geneva in 1633, and went through a cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy under Mr. Du Pan, and his divinity &s;tudies under Span|heim, Diodati, and Tronchin, who conceived a very great e&s;teem for him. He left Geneva in April 1641, and offered him&s;elf to the &s;ynod of Charenton in order to take upon him the office of a mini&s;ter: his abi|lities were greatly admited by the examiners, and the whole a&s;&s;embly was &s;o highly plea&s;ed with him, that they gave him the church of Meaux, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable then unprovided for.

He returned to his own country in the year 1653, where he remained till the revocation of the edict of Nantz in 1685. He retired to Francfort after this fatal blow; and having preached in the French church at Hanau, the whole a&s;&s;embly was &s;o edified by it, that they immediately called together the heads of the families, in order to propo&s;e that he might be invited to accept of being mini&s;ter there.

His preaching made &s;o great a noi&s;e at Hanau, that the profe&s;|&s;ors of divinity, and the German and Dutch mini&s;ters attended his &s;er|mons frequently; the count of Hanau him&s;elf, who had never been &s;een in the French church, came thither to hear Mr. Ancillon: they came from the neighbouring parts, and even from Francfort; peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who under&s;tood nothing of French, flocked together with great eager|ne&s;s, and &s;aid they loved to &s;ee him &s;peak.

<P>Mr. Ancillon having got a good deal of money by marriage, was enabled thereby to gratify his pa&s;&s;ion for books; his library was accord|ingly very curious and large, and he increa&s;ed it every day with all that appeared new and important in the republic of letters, &s;o that at la&s;t it was one of the noble&s;t collections in the hands of any private per&s;on in the kingdom; &s;uch foreigners as were curious vi&s;ited it, when they pa&s;&s;ed through the city of Metz, as the mo&s;t valuable curio|&s;ity there. Mr. Ancillon publi&s;hed at Sedan a volume in quarto, in the year 1657, in which the whole di&s;pute concerning traditions is amply and &s;olidly examined. This is a faithful account of all that pa&s;&s;ed in the conference which he had with Mr. Bedacier, doctor of Sorbonne, bi&s;hop of Augu&s;te, and &s;uffragan of the bi&s;hop of Metz: he di&s;puted with him before &s;everal per&s;ons, at fir&s;t in his own hou&s;e, and afterwards before a large audience in the bi&s;hop's palace. Mr. Bedacier thought proper to break off the di&s;pute, alledging it was much better to con|tinue the argument by writing than per&s;onal di&s;putation: it was agreed however that neither party &s;hould publi&s;h the particulars of this confer|ence. There was a monk, notwith&s;tanding, who took upon him to print a fal&s;e account of it, who&s;e impudence was &s;o flagrant, that although Mr. Ancillon had managed this conte&s;t with great honour to him&s;elf, yet he attempted to per&s;uade the public that it was very fatal to him and to his party, and that he lo&s;t the victory in it irrecoverably. This oc|ca&s;ioned Mr. Ancillon to publi&s;h the book abovementioned. When the Method of cardinal Richlieu appeared, Ancillon wrote a full and excellent an&s;wer to it; but he under&s;tood that Mr. Martel, profe&s;&s;or at Montauban, had written one, which was ready to be publi&s;hed; and that Mr. Claude, who had the &s;ame de&s;ign, had de&s;i&s;ted from executing it for the &s;ame rea&s;on, as appears from the third letter of his collection of letters in the fifth tome of his po&s;thumous works; he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed there|fore what he had done, and publi&s;hed only &s;ome &s;heets, which contain an an&s;wer to the &s;ixth chapter of that Method, or, an Apology for Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, and Beza; which was the title of this piece in the edition publi&s;hed at Hanau in 1666. He publi&s;hed al&s;o the Life of William Farel, or the Idea of a faithful Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The famous Mr. Conrart, who was one of his intimate friends, read this, and approved it, and wrote with his own hands &s;everal remarks in the margin of the manu&s;cript. Though Mr. Ancillon explained &s;everal entire books of the holy Scripture, and wrote all his &s;ermons, yet he never could be per&s;uaded to print them: all that we have of him of that kind is a &s;ermon preached at Metz on a fa&s;t-day; the con&s;i&s;tory

<HEAD>ANDERSON. (SIR EDMUND).</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNGER brother of a good family in Lincoln&s;hire, de&s;cended originally from Scotland. He received the fir&s;t part of his education in the country, and went afterwards to Lincoln college in Oxford: from thence he removed to the Inner Temple, where he read law with great a&s;&s;iduity, and in due time was called to the bar; and in the nine|teenth year of the reign of queen Elizabeth, he was appointed one of the queen's &s;erjeants at law. Some time after, he was made a judge; and, in 1581, being upon the Norfolk circuit, at Bury, he exerted him&s;elf again&s;t the famous Browne, who was the author of tho&s;e opi|nions which were afterwards maintained by a &s;ect called, from him, Browni&s;ts: for this conduct of judge Ander&s;on, the bi&s;hop of Norwich wrote a letter to trea&s;urer Burleigh, de&s;iring the &s;aid judge might receive the queen's thanks. In 1582, he was made lord chief ju&s;tice of the common pleas, and took his place the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the 4th of May, with great formality and ceremony. The year following he received the honour of knighthood. In 1586, he was appointed one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for trying Mary queen of Scots; on the 12th of October, the &s;ame year, he &s;at in judgment upon her, and on the 25th of the &s;ame month he &s;at again in the &s;tar-chamber, when &s;entence was pronounced again&s;t that unhappy queen. In 1587, he &s;at in the &s;tar-chamber, on &s;ecretary Davi&s;on, who was charged with i&s;&s;uing the warrant for the execution of the queen of Scots, contrary to queen Elizabeth's command, and without her knowledge: after the cau&s;e had been heard, Sir Roger Man|wood, chief baron of the exchequer, gave his opinion fir&s;t, wherein he extolled the queen's clemency, which he &s;aid Davi&s;on had prevented, and therefore he was for fining him ten thou&s;and pounds, and impri&s;on|ment during the queen's plea&s;ure.

It is highly probable the judge him&s;elf was &s;en&s;ible of the ill-will his proceedings again&s;t the di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church drew upon him; but it does not appear that it gave him any great pain, &s;ince in 1596, we have an account of his going to
<PB N="188" REF="206">
the northern circuit, where he behaved with the &s;ame rigour, declaring in his charges, that &s;uch per&s;ons as oppo&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, oppo&s;ed her maje&s;ty's authority, and were in that light enemies to the &s;tate, and di&s;turbers of the public peace; wherefore, of &s;uch he directed the grand juries to inquire, that they might be puni&s;hed. He was in|deed a very &s;trict lawyer, who governed him&s;elf entirely by &s;tatutes: this he &s;hewed on many occa&s;ions, particularly at the trial of Henry Cuffe, &s;ecretary to the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, where the attorney-general charg|ing the pri&s;oner &s;yllogi&s;tically, and Cuffe an&s;wering him in the &s;ame &s;tyle, lord chief ju&s;tice Ander&s;on &s;aid &s;martly, "I &s;it here to judge of law, and not of logic;" and directed Mr. attorney to pre&s;s the &s;tatute of Edward III. on which Mr. Cuffe was indicted. He was reputed &s;evere, and &s;trict in the ob&s;ervation of what was taught in courts, and laid down as law by reports; but this ought to be con&s;idered a vulgar opinion, for we have his expre&s;s declaration to the contrary, and that he neither expected precedents in all ca&s;es, nor would be bound by them where he &s;aw they were not founded upon ju&s;tice, but would act as if there were no &s;uch precedents. Of this we have a proof from the Re|ports in his time, publi&s;hed by Mr. Golde&s;borough: "The ca&s;e of Re&s;ceit was moved again; and Shuttleworth &s;aid, that he cannot be re|ceived, becau&s;e he is named in the writ; and &s;aid, that he had &s;earched all the books, and there is not one ca&s;e where he which is named in the writ, may be received." "What of that? (&s;aid judge Ander&s;on) &s;hall we not give judgment, becau&s;e it is not adjudged in the books before? we will give judgment according to rea&s;on; and if there be no rea&s;on in the books, I will not regard them." His &s;teadine&s;s was &s;o great, that he would not be driven from what he thought right, by any authority whatever, as appeared in the ca&s;e of Cavendi&s;h, a creature of the Earl of Leice&s;ter's, who had procured, by his intere&s;t, the queen's letters patent for making out writs of &s;uper&s;edeas upon exigents in the court of common pleas, and a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to the judges to admit him to that office; with which, as they conceived the queen had no right to grant any &s;uch patent, they did not comply. Upon this, Mr. Caven|di&s;h, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his patron, obtained a letter from the queen to quicken them, which however did not produce what was expected from it. The courtier however pur&s;ued his point, and obtained another let|ter under the queen's &s;ignet and &s;ign manual; this letter was delivered in pre&s;ence of the lord chancellor and the Earl of Leice&s;ter, in the begin|ning of Ea&s;ter term, and the judges de&s;ired time to con&s;ider it; and then an&s;wered, that they could not comply with the letter, becau&s;e it was incon&s;i&s;tent with their duty and their oaths of office. The queen upon this appointed the chancellor, the lord chief ju&s;tice of the queen's
<PB N="189" REF="207">
bench, and the ma&s;ter of the rolls, to hear this matter; and the queen's &s;erjeant having &s;et forth her prerogative, it was &s;hewn by the judges, that they could not grant offices by virtue of the queen's letters, where it did not appear to them that &s;he had a power to grant; that as the judges were bound by their oaths of office, &s;o her maje&s;ty was re&s;trained by her coronation-oath from &s;uch arbitrary interpo&s;itions: with which her maje&s;ty was &s;atisfied. He concurred al&s;o with his brethren in re|mon&s;trating boldly again&s;t &s;everal acts of power practi&s;ed in Elizabeth's reign, as appears in that memorable remon&s;trance recorded by him in his Reports. On the acce&s;&s;ion of King James I. he was continued in his office, which he held upwards of twenty-four years, to the time of his death, which happened at London, Augu&s;t 1, 1605: his body was interred on the 15th of September following, at Eyworth in Bedford|&s;hire, with great funeral pomp.

Upon the publication of the conference at Mompelgard abovementioned, he was accu&s;ed of having fal&s;ely imputed &s;ome things to Beza, which the latter had never a&s;&s;erted; he therefore went to Bern, to clear him&s;elf of the charge. His la&s;t

public act was a conference at Baden, in November 1589, with John Pi&s;torius. When he found death drawing near, he made a declaration to &s;everal of his friends, of his con&s;tancy in the faith which he had a&s;&s;ert|ed, and &s;hewed the mo&s;t undoubted &s;igns of a &s;incere devotion till he expired, on the 7th of January, 1590, being &s;ixty-one years and nine months old. The following character is given him by Melchior Adam: "He was (&s;ays this author) an excellent preacher, had an ea&s;y manner of in&s;tructing the people, and delivered the mo&s;t ob&s;cure points in &s;uch a per&s;picuous &s;tyle, that they were under&s;tood by the generality of the audience. When he exhorted them to the reformation of their lives, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emon&s;trated again&s;t vice, he made u&s;e of great energy of language and elevation of voice, being extremely well qualified both by nature and art for moving the pa&s;&s;ions; and when there was occa&s;ion for it, his eloquence was forcible like thunder, and he &s;poke with &s;uch vehemence that he would &s;weat all over his body, even in the mid&s;t of winter. In executing the &s;everal branches of his duty, he &s;pared no labour, and was deterred by no fatigue. He was perpetually engaged in compo&s;ing &s;ome work or other, or in writing letters, upon various &s;ubjects, to per&s;ons of all ranks who con&s;ulted him: the&s;e things he di&s;patched with admirable quickne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s. There was hardly a day pa&s;&s;ed, but he gave advice to &s;everal per&s;ons; being always ready to gratify tho&s;e who &s;olicited his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He was in great favour with princes and men of the highe&s;t rank, his conver&s;ation being very agreeable and faceti|ous. He had a warm zeal for the religion which he profe&s;&s;ed, and was extremely &s;orry whenever he heard that any per&s;on had abandoned it." He wrote a great number of books, the mo&s;t remarkable of which was his book on Concord, and &s;ome treati&s;es he had wrote on the Ubi|quity of Chri&s;t.</P>

<PB N="193" REF="211">
where he acquired the greate&s;t reputation. We are told wonderful things concerning the au&s;terity of his life, that he macerated his body with prayer and fa&s;ting, and lay upon the bare ground for twenty years together, covered only with a bear-&s;kin: this is atte&s;ted by very good authors; but if the &s;tory which Poggius tells of him, in his je&s;ts, be true, he mu&s;t afterwards have relaxed much of this continency: "<HI>Jo|annem Andream</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>doctorem Bononien&s;em cujus fama admodum vul|gata e&s;t, &s;ubagitantem ancillam dome&s;ticam uxor deprehendit: re in&s;ueta &s;tu|pefacta mulier in virum ver&s;a, Ubi nunc, ait, Joannes, e&s;t &s;apientia ve&s;tra? ille nil amplius locutus.

To perpetuate the memory of his daughter, he intitled his Commentary upon the Decretals of Gregory IX. the Novellae. He married her to John Calderinus, a learned canoni&s;t. The fir&s;t work of Andreas was his Glo&s;s upon the &s;ixth book of the Decretals, which he wrote when he was very young. He wrote al&s;o Glo&s;&s;es upon the Clementines, and a Commentary in Regulas Sexti, which he intitled Mercuriales, becau&s;e he either engaged in it on Wedne&s;days, diebus Mercurii, or becau&s;e he in&s;erted his Wedne&s;days' di&s;putes in it. He enlarged the Speculum of Durant, in the year 1347. This is all which Mr. Bayle mentions of his writings, though he wrote many more. Andreas died of the plague at Bologna, in 1348, after he had been a profe&s;&s;or five-and-forty years, and was buried in the church of the Dominicans. Many eulo|giums have been be&s;towed upon him, having been called archidoctor decretorum; in his epitaph he has the title of "<HI>Rabbi doctorum, lux, cen|&s;or, normaque morum:</HI> rabbi of the doctors, the light, cen&s;or, and rule of manners." And it is &s;aid, that Pope Boniface called him <HI>lumen mundi,</HI> the light of the world. Mr. Bayle &s;ays it was pity Andreas followed the method of the Pyrrhoni&s;ts &s;o much; that he proved his own opinion very &s;olidly when he had a mind to it, but this he &s;eldom did, chu&s;ing rather to relate the &s;entiments of others, and to leave his readers in the mid&s;t of the di&s;pute.</P>

<P>A NATIVE of Padua, and mo&s;t celebrated actre&s;s towards the be|ginning of the &s;eventeenth century.

<HEAD>ANDREWS (LANCELOT),</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent Engli&s;h divine, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in the reigns of James I. and Charles I. born in London, in 1565. He had the rudi|ments of his education in the Coopers free-&s;chool at Radcliffe, and was afterwards &s;ent to Merchant-taylors: here he made a great proficiency in the learned languages; and Dr. Watts, re&s;identiary of St. Paul's and archdeacon of Middle&s;ex, who had lately founded &s;ome &s;cholar|&s;hips at Pembroke hall in Cambridge, &s;ent him to that college on the fir&s;t of his exhibitions. After he had taken the degree of bachelor of arts, he was cho&s;en fellow of the college: &s;oon after having taken the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, he applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of divinity; and being cho&s;en catechi&s;t in the college, he read a lecture on the ten
<PB N="196" REF="214">
commandments every Saturday and Sunday, to which great numbers out of the other colleges of the univer&s;ity, and even out of the country, re&s;orted as to a divinity lecture. His reputation increa&s;ing daily, he began to be taken notice of by Sir Francis Wal&s;ingham, &s;ecretary of &s;tate to queen Elizabeth, who being unwilling &s;o fine a genius &s;hould be buried in the country, procured him the vicarage of St. Giles's Crip|plegate, in London; and got him afterwards cho&s;en a prebendary and re&s;identiary of St. Paul's, and al&s;o prebendary of the collegiate church of Southwell. Being thus preferred, he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a dili|gent and excellent preacher, and read divinity lectures three times a week at St. Paul's, in term time. Upon the death of Dr. Fulke, he was cho&s;en ma&s;ter of Pembroke hall, to which college he became a con&s;i|derable benefactor. He was al&s;o appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to queen Elizabeth, who took great delight in his preaching. He was in no le&s;s e&s;teem with her &s;ucce&s;&s;or James I. who gave him the preference above all other divines as a preacher, and made choice of him to vindicate his &s;overeignty. His maje&s;ty having, in his Defence of the Rights of Kings, a&s;&s;erted the authority of Chri&s;tian princes over cau&s;es and per&s;ons eccle&s;ia&s;tical, Cardinal Bellarmine, under the name of Matthew Tortus, attacked him with great vehemency and bitterne&s;s. The king employed Andrews to an&s;wer the cardinal, who did it with great &s;pirit and judgment, in a piece intitled Tortura Torti, etc. His maje&s;ty upon this promoted him to the bi&s;hopric of Chiche&s;ter, to which he was con&s;ecrated November 3, 1605: and at the &s;ame time made him his almoner; in which place Dr. Andrews behaved with great honour and fidelity, not even making tho&s;e advantages to him&s;elf which he might legally have done. Upon the vacancy of the bi&s;hopric of Ely, he was advanced to that &s;ee, and con&s;ecrated September 22, 1609. He was al&s;o nominated one of the king's privy coun&s;ellors of England, and afterwards of Scotland when he attended his maje&s;ty to that kingdom. When he had been nine years in the &s;ee of Ely, he was advanced to the bi&s;hopric of Winche&s;ter, and deanry of the king's chapel, which two la&s;t preferments he held till his death. There is a plea&s;ant &s;tory related of him, while he was bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, in the life of Waller the poet: Waller going to &s;ee the king at dinner, over|heard a very extraordinary conver&s;ation between his maje&s;ty, the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter, and Dr. Neale, bi&s;hop of Durham. The&s;e two prelates &s;tanding behind the king's chair, his maje&s;ty a&s;ked them, "My lords (&s;aid he) cannot I take my &s;ubjects money when I want it, without all this formality in parliament?" the bi&s;hop of Durham readily an&s;wered, "God forbid, Sir, but you &s;hould; you are the breath of our no&s;trils." Whereupon the king turned, and &s;aid to the bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter,
<Q REND="inline">"well,
<PB N="197" REF="215">
my lord, what &s;ay you?"</Q>
"Sir (replied the bi&s;hop) I have no &s;kill to judge of parliamentary ca&s;es." The king an&s;wered, "No put-offs, my lord; an&s;wer me pre&s;ently." "Then, Sir, (&s;aid he), I think it lawful for you to take my brother Neale's money, for he offers it." Mr. Wal|ler &s;ays, the company was plea&s;ed with this an&s;wer, but the wit of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eemed to affect the king, for a certain lord coming in &s;oon after, his maje&s;ty cried out, "O, my lord, they &s;ay that you lig with my lady." "No, Sir, (&s;ays his lord&s;hip in confu&s;ion), but I like her company, becau&s;e &s;he has &s;o much wit." "Why then (&s;ays the king) do not you lig with my lord of Winche&s;ter there." This great prelate was in no le&s;s reputation and e&s;teem with king Charles I. than he had been with his predece&s;&s;ors. He died at Winche&s;ter-hou&s;e in Southwark, Septem|ber 27, 1626, in the &s;eventy-fir&s;t year of his age, and was buried in the pari&s;h church of St. Saviour's, where his executors erected to him a very fair monument of marble and alaba&s;ter, on which is an elegant in&s;cription, written by one of his chaplains. Mr. Milton has wrote al&s;o a beautiful elegy on his death, in the &s;ame language. In the dedication of his &s;ermons, publi&s;hed under the care and in&s;pection of Dr. Laud, bi&s;hop of London, and the bi&s;hop of Ely above mentioned, we have the following character of this prelate: "The per&s;on who&s;e works the&s;e are, was from his youth a man of extraordinary worth and note; a man as if he had been made up of learning and virtue, both of them &s;o eminent in him, that it is hard to judge which had precedency. His virtue (which we mu&s;t &s;till judge the more worthy in any man) was comparable to that which was to be found in the primitive bi&s;hop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the church; and had he lived among&s;t tho&s;e ancient fathers, his virtues would have &s;hined even among&s;t tho&s;e virtuous men. And for his learning, it was as well, if not better, known abroad than re&s;pected at home: and take him in his latitude, we, which knew him well, knew not any &s;ort of learning to which he was a &s;tranger; but in his profe&s;&s;ion, admirable. None &s;tronger than he, where he wre&s;tled with an adver&s;ary; and that Bellarmine felt, who was as well able to &s;hift for him&s;elf as any that &s;tood up for the Roman party. None more exact, more judicious, than he, where he was to in&s;truct and inform others; and that as they knew, who often heard him preach, &s;o they may learn which will read this which he hath left behind him. And yet this fulne&s;s of his material learning left room enough in the temper of his brain for almo&s;t all languages, learned and modern, to &s;eat them|&s;elves: &s;o that his learning had all the helps language could afford, and his languages learning enough for the be&s;t of them to expre&s;s; his judgment, in the mean time, &s;o commanding over both, as that neither of them was &s;uffered idly or curiou&s;ly to &s;tart from or fall &s;hort of their

intended &s;cope: &s;o that we may better &s;ay of him, than was &s;ometimes &s;aid of Claudius Dru&s;us. "He was of as many and as great virtues, as mortal nature could receive, or indu&s;try make perfect." Be&s;ides the Tortura Torti, already mentioned, bi&s;hop Andrews wrote a Manual of private Devotions and Meditations for every Day in the Week; and a Manual of Directions for the Vi&s;itation of the Sick: there were like|wi&s;e &s;everal &s;ermons and tracts in Engli&s;h and Latin of his, publi&s;hed after his death.

&s;eems to have had a great e&s;teem for the opinions of this gentleman, as may be &s;een in his writings, particularly in the preface to his Latin work, concerning the In&s;titutions of the Peripatetic Philo&s;ophy, according to the hypothe&s;is of Sir Kenelm. He was a great advocate for the peripa|tetic philo&s;ophy. He attempted even to make the principles of Ari&s;|totle &s;ub&s;ervient to the explaining the mo&s;t impenetrable my&s;teries of religion: and with this view he engaged in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of prede&s;tina|tion, free-will, and grace. Mr. Baillet &s;ays, "What he wrote upon this &s;ubject re&s;embles the ancient oracles for ob&s;curity." His an&s;wer to this accu&s;ation brought again&s;t him by &s;everal authors, may not perhaps be improperly mentioned here, as it gives an idea of the pecu|liarity of his temper and genius: "I value my&s;elf (&s;ays he) upon a bre|vity and conci&s;ene&s;s, which is &s;uitable to the teachers of &s;cience. The divines are the cau&s;e that my writings are ob&s;cure, for they refu&s;e to give me any opportunity of explaining my&s;elf: in &s;hort, either the learn|ed under&s;tand me, or they do not: if they do under&s;tand me, and find me in an error, it is ea&s;y for them to refute me; if they do not un|der&s;tand me, it is unrea&s;onable for them to exclaim again&s;t my doc|trines." In &s;uch ab&s;tru&s;e points as we have mentioned he was much embarra&s;&s;ed, and by giving too great &s;cope to his own thoughts, he plea&s;ed neither the Molini&s;ts nor Jan&s;eni&s;ts. He is allowed, how|ever, to have been a man of an exten&s;ive and penetrating genius, but having no talent at di&s;tingui&s;hing the ideas which &s;hould have &s;erved as the rule and foundation of his rea&s;oning, he could not clear up the difficulties wherein he involved him&s;elf. On the 10th of June, 1658, the congregation of the Index expurgatorius at Rome, condemned &s;ome treati&s;es of Thomas Anglus. The doctors of Douay cen&s;ured al&s;o two-and-twenty propo&s;itions extracted from his Sacred In&s;titutions. He publi&s;hed his Supplicatio po&s;tulativa Ju&s;titiae, in oppo&s;ition to their cen|&s;ure, wherein he complains that they had given him a vague undeter|mined cen&s;ure, without taxing any particular propo&s;ition. He died &s;ome time after the re&s;toration of Charles II. but in what year is un|certain.</P>

<P>The great &s;chi&s;m which divided the church after the death of pope Gregory IX. occa&s;ioned likewi&s;e a divi&s;ion among&s;t the religious orders, particularly that of the Carmelites.

The chapter obeyed the pope's directions, and cho&s;e Angriani under the title of vicar general, which was confirmed by a bull of that pope, dated the 19th of April, 1380; and the year following he was cho&s;en general of the order by the chapter held at Verona; the pro|vincials of the provinces who declared for Clement VII. not being pre|&s;ent, their places were &s;upplied by other monks named in their room; and in 1385, he had the &s;ame honour conferred on him by the general chapter held at Bamberge, in the province of Upper Germany. But the year following going to Genoa, to wait upon pope Urban VI. he was depo&s;ed from his office, without any cau&s;e alledged for it; &s;ome per&s;ons indeed &s;uppo&s;ed it might be oweing to his being an intimate friend and confident of certain cardinals whom the pope cau&s;ed to be put to death about that time; others imagined it to be owing to &s;ome &s;u&s;picions which the pope entertained again&s;t the archdeacon of Bruges, who had been Angriani's &s;cholar.

<HEAD>ANNESLEY (ARTHUR),</HEAD>
<P>EARL of Angle&s;ey, and Lord Privy Seal in the reign of Charles II. He was the &s;on of Sir Francis Anne&s;ley, Baronet, Lord Mount Norris,
<PB N="202" REF="220">
and Vi&s;count Valentia, in Ireland; by his fir&s;t wife Dorothy, daughter to Sir John Phillips of Picton ca&s;tle, Pembroke&s;hire. He was born in Dublin, July 10th, 1614, and had his Chri&s;tian name from his god|father, the Lord Chiche&s;ter deputy of Ireland. He was removed to Eng|land when ten years old, was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Oxford when &s;ixteen, and becoming a fellow commoner in Magdalen college, was placed under an experienced tutor, in 1630. Here he pur&s;ued his &s;tudies for three or four years, e&s;teemed as a youth who&s;e hopeful genius was an honour to his college, and enjoying the friend&s;hip of the pre&s;ident, Dr. Frewen, (afterwards archbi&s;hop of York), and many eminent per&s;ons, among whom was the celebrated Dr. Hammond. In 1634, he was removed to Lincoln's-Inn, where he &s;tudied law with great &s;ucce&s;s, till his father thought proper to &s;end him on the tour of Europe; from which, after &s;ome &s;tay at Rome, he returned to England in 1640. The &s;ame year he was elected knight of the &s;hire for Radnor; but quickly lo&s;t his &s;eat by a vote of the commons, which declared C. Price <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> duly elected. In the beginning of the civil war he inclined to the royal cau&s;e; but af|terwards &s;o perfectly reconciled him&s;elf to the parliament, that he was &s;ent by that body as commi&s;&s;ioner into Ul&s;ter, in the year 1645. An arduous undertaking, con&s;idering to how low an ebb the Engli&s;h intere&s;t was brought by means of the Scotch forces, under General Monroe, having been long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e parts. However Mr. Anne&s;ley conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch addre&s;s, that the great rebel, Owen O'Neil was di&s;appointed in his de&s;igns, both on this province and on that of Connaught. The popi&s;h archbi&s;hop of Tuam, who was the great oracle of his party, and who&s;e councils had hitherto been very &s;ucce&s;s|ful, was not only taken pri&s;oner, but his papers &s;eized, and his foreign corre&s;pondence di&s;covered, by which all the de&s;igns of the rebels were broken, and va&s;t advantages accrued to the prote&s;tant intere&s;t. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> parliament had &s;ent commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the Marquis of Ormond, for the delivering up of Dublin, though without &s;ucce&s;s. But the &s;tate of affairs rendering it nece&s;&s;ary to renew their corre&s;pondence with him, they made choice of a &s;econd commi&s;&s;ion, con&s;i&s;ting of men, who in their judgment were more agreeable to him, and at the head of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> commi&s;&s;ion Mr. Anne&s;ley was placed. The&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners landed at Dublin on the 7th of June, 1647, and were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in their nego|ciations, that in a few days a treaty was concluded between them and the lord-lieutenant: it was &s;igned on the 19th of that month, and very &s;oon after Dublin was put into the hands of the parliament. This was certainly a very &s;ignal &s;ervice not only to tho&s;e who employed him, but to the whole prote&s;tant intere&s;t in Ireland, which was then on the very point of being extingui&s;hed. However after the commi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="203" REF="221">
a&s;&s;umed the &s;upreme power, he was not able to hinder them from doing many things again&s;t his judgment; and, therefore, ought not to be blam|ed f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r tho&s;e irregularities, which were &s;uch as the times &s;eemed to re|quire, though they could not excu&s;e. Mr. Anne&s;ley, not liking his &s;ituation, returned &s;peedily home, where he found all things in confu&s;ion, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">overment being on the very point of di&s;&s;olution, which however did not di&s;courage him from doing all that lay in his power to &s;erve his coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry; and though he did this without effect, yet &s;ure it is very unju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to charge him with it as an offence, as Wood does, who repre|&s;ents him as an ab&s;olute time &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rver, though he was one of the &s;ecluded members, and as eminent for oppo&s;ing the illegal things done after the murder of the king, as any man in the nation, who had not borne arms in his &s;ervice. After the death of Cromwell, when the rump re&s;umed their old power, Mr. Anne&s;ley, though he doubted whether the parlia|ment was not di&s;&s;olved by the death of the king, re&s;olved to get into the hou&s;e if it were po&s;&s;ible; in which good de&s;ign he got &s;everal wor|thy gentlemen to concur with him, but with little &s;ucce&s;s, though the &s;cheme was managed with great wi&s;dom and &s;pirit, &s;uch as &s;ufficiently declared what his real &s;entiments were, and how much he had the re|&s;ettling the con&s;titution at heart. In the confu&s;ions which followed he had little or no &s;hare, as being too well known to be tru&s;ted either by the rump or the army; and be&s;ides, he was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected of know|ing at lea&s;t of Sir George Booth's in&s;urrection, if not of being concerned in it. But when things began to take a better turn, by the re&s;toring of the &s;ecluded members to their &s;eats, February 21, 1660, Mr. Anne&s;ley began again to make a figure, and to appear in his old character, that of a true patriot. In this he appeared with &s;uch lu&s;tre, that he was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of the new council of &s;tate, having at that time a corre&s;|pondence with his maje&s;ty King Charles II. then in exile; which co&s;t him the life of his dear brother, who was drowned in &s;topping into a packet-boat with letters for his maje&s;ty. Soon after the re&s;toration, viz. on the 20th of April, 1661, he was rai&s;ed to the dignity of a ba|ron of England, by the title of Lord Anne&s;ley of Newport Pagnel, in the county of Bucks; as al&s;o of an earl, by the &s;tyle of * * * * * * which &s;ome little time after was changed for that of Angle&s;ey. In the preamble of the patent, notice is expre&s;sly taken of the &s;ervices rendered by him in the king's re&s;toration: nay, &s;ome tell us, that his lord&s;hip might have been prime mini&s;ter, if he had not declined it, to avoid envy. However he had always a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the king's favour; and was heard with great attention at council, and in the hou&s;e of lords. He certainly &s;howed his extreme dete&s;tation of the king's murder, by his &s;itting in judgment on the regicides at Hicks's hall, and the Old

Bailey, though the Oxford hi&s;torian reflects upon this, in&s;inuating that he had been as deep in tho&s;e matters as the per&s;ons then tried, which is a palpable fal&s;ity. Many reflections of this &s;ort he bore in his life-time with great con&s;tancy, or rather indifference, being de&s;irous of di&s;charg|ing his duty to his king and country without hurting others, and with|out being &s;olicitous of making great advantages to him&s;elf; yet as he &s;erved a generous ma&s;ter, he received from him offices both of profit and tru&s;t. In 1667 he was made trea&s;urer of the navy; and on the 4th of Fe|bruary, 1671-2, his maje&s;ty in council was plea&s;ed to appoint the Duke of Buckingham, the Earl of Angle&s;ey, the Lord Holles, the Lord A&s;hley, and Mr. Secretary Trevor, or any three of them, to be a committee, to peru&s;e and revi&s;e all the papers and writings concerning the &s;ettlement of Ireland, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t, and to make an ab&s;tract of the &s;tate thereof in writing. And accordingly, on the 12th of June, 1672, they made their report at large, which was the foundation of a commi&s;&s;ion, dated the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1672, to Prince Rupert, the Dukes of Buck|ingham and Lauderdale, Earl of Angle&s;ey, Lords A&s;hley and Holles, Sir John Trevor, and Sir Thomas Chichley, to in&s;pect the &s;ettlement of Ireland, and all proceedings in order thereunto. And this was follow|ed by another commi&s;&s;ion of the &s;eventeenth of January, 1672-3, to Prince Rupert, &amp;c. whereunto the Duke of Ormond, the Earl of Shafts|bury, and the lord trea&s;urer Clifford, were added to in&s;pect the affairs of Ireland, viz. the acts of &s;ettlement and explanation, and the exe|cution of them, and the di&s;po&s;ing the forfeited lands, and the &s;tate of his maje&s;ty's revenue, &amp;c. After which, by rea&s;on of his &s;ingular pru|dence and fidelity the Earl of Angle&s;ey had the great office of lord privy &s;eal conferred on him, the 22d of April, 1673, and all this, notwith&s;tand|ing a great variety of attempts made to prejudice him, as well in the king's as in the public opinion; all which he not only effectually defeated by clearly expo&s;ing them, and manife&s;ting his own innocence, but al&s;o turned them to his advantage, &s;o as to ri&s;e more by the intrigues of his enemies, than by any art of his own. The long experience his lord&s;hip had of men and things, rendered him &s;o true a judge of merit, that he could di&s;cover it in men of all per&s;ua&s;ions, and his freedom from prejudice was &s;uch, that he could hate it in none, how different &s;oever from him|&s;elf they might be in religious or political opinions. This noble di&s;|po&s;ition rendered him liable to a formidable attack, during the time of the popi&s;h plot; when to have behaved with decency towards the Roman Catholics of any rank, was &s;ufficient to &s;tigmatize the &s;incere&s;t Prote&s;tant, with the dangerous character of being a favourer of Papi&s;ts. One Danger-field, who&s;e name will be tran&s;mitted to late po&s;terity, as a di&s;coverer of plots, true and fal&s;e, on the 20th of Oct. 1680, charged his lord&s;hip, in
<PB N="205" REF="223">
an information delivered upon oath, at the bar of the hou&s;e of com|mons, with endeavouring to &s;tifle evidence, with relation to the popi&s;h plot, and to promote the belief of a Pre&s;byterian one, with many other things alike probable, or rather alike improbable, yet &s;o far credited at that time as to receive countenance from the hou&s;e. The trouble he received from this ba&s;e attack, did not hinder him from &s;peaking his opinion freely upon tho&s;e matters in the hou&s;e of lords, particularly in relation to the Iri&s;h plot, of which he declared his ab&s;olute di&s;belief, when few dur&s;t own they &s;u&s;pected it, notwith&s;tanding the apparent im|po&s;ture in the accounts given of it. His charity for men of all religions did not, however, abate either his zeal for the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, or his affection for the true intere&s;t of his country. The Earl of Ca&s;tlehaven thought fit, in the year 1680, to write his Memoirs, in which he took a great deal of pains to repre&s;ent the general rebellion in Ireland, in the lighte&s;t colours po&s;&s;ible, and as if it had been far from univer&s;al at fir&s;t, and that it was made &s;o, at lea&s;t as much by the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by &s;uch as ought to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them, as by any ill intention of the Catholics concerned in it. The Earl of Angle&s;ey having received the&s;e memoirs from their author, thought fit to write &s;ome animadver|&s;ions upon them, which he did in a letter to the Earl of Ca&s;tlehaven, wherein he takes notice of abundance of remarkable pa&s;&s;ages in tho&s;e di&s;tracted times; and, as his &s;ubject led him, delivered his opinion freely in re&s;pect to the Duke of Ormond, and his management of affairs in that kingdom. This letter to the Earl of Ca&s;tlehaven was written in Augu&s;t 1680, but was not publi&s;hed till 1681. The Duke of Ormond, about a year afterwards, expo&s;tulated with the lord privy &s;eal, on this &s;ubject, by letter, to which the earl replied; and there the matter re&s;ted. In 1682, when the nation was in a high ferment, the earl drew up a very particular remon&s;trance, dated April the 27th, the &s;ame year, and pre&s;ented it to his maje&s;ty. It was very warm and very loyal; and yet it was far from being well received. It was not, however, thought proper to remove him from his high office on this account; and therefore, in the month of June, 1682, the Duke of Ormond, then lord-lieutenant of Ireland, was prevailed upon to exhibit a charge again&s;t the lord privy &s;eal, on account of his reflections on the Earl of Ca&s;tlehaven's Memoirs. This produced a &s;harp di&s;pute between tho&s;e two peers, which ended in the Earl of Angle&s;ey's lo&s;ing his place of lord privy &s;eal, though it certainly rai&s;ed his reputation; his very ene|mies being forced to confe&s;s, that he was both hardly and unju&s;tly treated. After this misfortune, which happened in Augu&s;t 1682, his lord&s;hip remained pretty much at his country-&s;eat at Blechingdon, in Oxford|&s;hire, where he devoted his time to his &s;tudies, and meddled very little
<PB N="206" REF="224">
with public affairs: yet did he not entirely abandon bu&s;ine&s;s, much le&s;s di&s;cover any pique or di&s;re&s;pect towards the royal family, on ac|count of what he had &s;uffered; but behaved with &s;o much temper and duty, that without betraying or even di&s;&s;embling his principles, he re|covered the favour of king James II. &s;o that it is generally believed he would very &s;peedily have been declared lord chancellor of England, if this had not been prevented by his death, which happened April the 6th, 1686, at his hou&s;e in Drury-lane, without any long &s;ickne&s;s, by a quin&s;y, in the &s;eventy-third year of his age. He left behind him a numerous po&s;terity. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay any thing worthy of &s;o great a man's character, and yet &s;omething is nece&s;&s;ary to complete the de&s;ign of this life, and to give the reader &s;ome idea of his mind, as well as his fortune. As he had an excellent and univer&s;al education, becoming the heir of a noble family, &s;o he was always remarkably prone to learning, and to the encouragement of learned men. He was well read in the Cla&s;&s;ics, and perfectly ver&s;ed not only in the Greek and Roman hi&s;tory, but in the &s;pirit and policy of the&s;e famous nations. His intercour&s;e, however, with foreign wri|ters, did not hinder him from retaining a &s;uperior pa&s;&s;ion for all the branches of learning, which had any re&s;pect to his own country. He had &s;tudied the laws with &s;uch diligence, as to be &s;tyled and e&s;teemed a lawyer, even by the mo&s;t conceited lawyers of his time. In hi&s;tory he was a very great critic; and with re&s;pect to records, and whatever el&s;e fell under the con&s;ideration of a judicious antiquary, no man of his time de&s;erved greater reputation than he: he was al&s;o well ver&s;ed in the civil and canon law, under&s;tood ehurch hi&s;tory perfectly, and was a great divine. His writings which are extant, will fully &s;upport all that has been hitherto &s;aid; and the world would have had &s;till higher proofs of his lord&s;hip's great learning and abilities, if the large&s;t and mo&s;t valuable of all his works had not been unluckily lo&s;t, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, injuriou&s;ly de&s;troyed. However, as Anthony Wood, who never &s;peaks well of this nobleman, but again&s;t his will, allows that he had a &s;mooth, &s;harp, and keen pen, we pre&s;ume that nobody will doubt it. As to the a&s;per&s;ions thrown on his memory, by a reverend prelate his contemporary, they would have de&s;erved a more particular con&s;ide|ration, if it had been u&s;ual for that writer to have given good characters of his acquaintance, or to have avoided characterizing &s;uch as he had little or no acquaintance with. We will conclude our account of this noble per&s;on, with ob&s;erving, that he was one of the fir&s;t Engli&s;h peers who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by collecting a fine library, which he per|formed with great care, as well as at a large expence; and as he was de&s;irous that &s;o valuable a collection might not quickly be di&s;&s;ipated,
<PB N="207" REF="225">
but remain in his family, he cau&s;ed it to be di&s;po&s;ed in a manner &s;uit|able to its worth, in a particular apartment in Angle&s;ey hou&s;e. But the&s;e precautions proved fruitle&s;s, as his lord&s;hip's good intentions likewi&s;e did; his books within a few months after his decea&s;e being expo&s;ed to public &s;ale by Mr. Millington, a famous auctioneer. Yet this &s;ale was attended with an accident, which will hinder its being ever forgotten. We mean the di&s;covery of the Earl's famous Memo|randum in the blank leaf of an <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the pourtraiture of his &s;acred maje&s;ty in his &s;olitudes and &s;ufferings, in order to di&s;abu&s;e the world as to the true author of that book, who, according to that memorandum, was not king Charles I. but bi&s;hop Gauden, which produced a long controver&s;y, managed by various hands, and in &s;everal books. James, the &s;econd Earl of Angle&s;ey, who &s;ucceeded his fa|ther in 1686, died in 1690, and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on James, who married her grace the late Duche&s;s of Buckingham&s;hire. He died in the beginning of the year 1702, and was &s;ucceeded by his brother John Earl of Angle&s;ey, who was vice trea&s;urer, receiver-general, and pay|ma&s;ter of the forces in Ireland. He was &s;ucceeded at his death, 1710, by his brother Arthur, who, while he &s;at in the hou&s;e of commons in Ireland, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the weight and eloquence of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;peeches, and was always heard, after his acce&s;&s;ion to the title of Earl of Angle&s;ey, with the utmo&s;t attention in the Briti&s;h hou&s;e of peers.

<HEAD>ANSELM.</HEAD>
<P>ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury in the reign of William Rufus and Henry I. was an Italian by birth, being born in the year 1033, at Ao&s;t&punc;
<PB N="208" REF="226">
a town at the foot of the Alps, belonging to the Duke of Savoy. He was de&s;cended of a con&s;iderable family: his father's name was Gundul|phus, and his mother's Hemeberga. After he had gone through a cour&s;e of &s;tudies, and travelled for &s;ome time in Burgundy and France, he took the mona&s;tic habit in the abbey of Becc, in Normandy, of which Lanfranc, afterwards archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was then prior. At that time An&s;elm was no more than 27 years of age. Three years af|ter, when Lanfranc was made abbot of Caen, An&s;elm &s;ucceeded him in the priory of Becc; and when Herluin, abbot of that mona&s;tery, died, An&s;elm was promoted to the abbacy. About the year 1092, An&s;elm came over into England, being invited thither by Hugh Earl of Che&s;ter, who reque&s;ted his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his &s;ickne&s;s. Soon after his arrival, William Rufus, falling &s;ick at Glouce&s;ter, and being pre&s;&s;ed to fill up the &s;ee of Canterbury, which had been vacant above four years, thought fit to nominate An&s;elm; who with much difficulty was pre|vailed upon to accept that dignity. Before his con&s;ecration, he gained a promi&s;e from the king for the re&s;titution of all the lands, which were in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that &s;ee in Lanfranc's time. And thus having &s;ecu|red the temporalities of the archbi&s;hopric, and done homage to the king, he was con&s;ecrated with great &s;olemnity on the 4th of December, 1093. Soon after his con&s;ecration, the king intending to wre&s;t the duchy of Normandy from his brother Robert, endeavouring to rai&s;e what mo|ney he could for that purpo&s;e, An&s;elm made him an offer of five hun|dred pounds; which the king thinking too little, refu&s;ed to accept, and the archbi&s;hop thereby fell under the king's di&s;plea&s;ure. About that time he had a di&s;pute with the bi&s;hop of London, touching the right of con|&s;ecrating churches in a foreign dioce&s;e. The next year the king being ready to embark for Normandy, An&s;elm waited upon him, and de&s;ired his leave to convene a national &s;ynod, in which the di&s;orders of the church and &s;tate, and the general di&s;&s;olution of manners, might be reme|died: but the king refu&s;ed his reque&s;t, and even treated him very roughly; upon which the archbi&s;hop and his retinue withdrew from court. Ano|ther cau&s;e of di&s;content between the king and the archbi&s;hop, was, An&s;elm's de&s;iring leave to go to Rome, to receive the pall from pope Urban II. whom the king of England did not acknowledge as pope, being more inclined to favour the party of his competitor Guibert. This mi&s;under&s;tanding occa&s;ioned great di&s;putes; and to put an end to the controver&s;y, a council or convention was held at Rockingham ca&s;tle; the i&s;&s;ue of which was, that the majority of the bi&s;hops, being either gained or overawed by the court, threw up their canonical obedience, and renounced An&s;elm for their archbi&s;hop. In con&s;equence of this proceeding An&s;elm de&s;ired a pa&s;&s;port, to go beyond the &s;ea, till the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="209" REF="227">
mi&s;under&s;tandings could be made up. But the king ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ed his reque&s;t, and would only con&s;ent, that there &s;hould be a kind of truce or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the affair from March to Whit&s;untide, during which interval the difference was to &s;leep. But before the expiration of this term, the king broke through the agreement, bani&s;hed &s;everal cler|gymen who were An&s;elm's favourites, and mi&s;erably hara&s;&s;ed the te|nants of his &s;ee. Whit&s;untide being come, and the bi&s;hops having in vain endeavoured to &s;often An&s;elm into a compliance; the king, with the advice of his great men, received him into favour, upon his own terms; and becau&s;e An&s;elm per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to receive the pall from the king's hands, it was at la&s;t agreed, that the pope's nuncio, who had brought the pall into England, &s;hould carry it down to Canterbury, and lay it upon the altar of the cathedral; from whence An&s;elm was to receive it, as if it had been put into his hands by St. Peter him&s;elf. Things being thus adju&s;ted, the archbi&s;hop went to Canterbury, and received the pall with great &s;olemnity, the June following. And now it was generally hoped, that all occa&s;ion of difference between the king and the archbi&s;hop was removed: but it appeared &s;oon after, that the reconciliation on the king's part was not &s;incere. For William having marched his forces into Wales, and brought that country to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, took that opportunity to quarrel with An&s;elm, pretending he was not &s;atisfied with the quota the archbi&s;hop had furni&s;hed for that expedition. Finding therefore his authority too weak to oppo&s;e the corruptions of the times, he re&s;olved to go in per&s;on to Rome, and con&s;ult the pope. But the king, to whom he applied for leave to go out of the kingdom, &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at the reque&s;t, and gave him a flat denial. Notwith|&s;tanding this the archbi&s;hop re&s;olved upon the voyage, and accordingly embarked at Dover. But when the king heard that he had cro&s;&s;ed the Channel, he &s;eized upon the archbi&s;hopric, and made every thing void which An&s;elm had done. The archbi&s;hop got &s;afe to Rome, and was honourably received by the pope. After a &s;hort &s;tay in that city, he accompanied the pope to a country &s;eat near Capua, whither his holine&s;s retired on account of the unhealthine&s;s of the town. And here An&s;elm wrote a book, in which he gave an account of the rea&s;on of our Saviour's Incarnation. The Pope wrote to the King of England in a &s;train of authority, enjoining him to rein&s;tate An&s;elm in all the profits and privileges of his &s;ee. An&s;elm likewi&s;e wrote into England upon the &s;ame &s;ubject. As for the king, he endeavoured to get An&s;elm di&s;countenanced abroad, and wrote to Roger Duke of Apulia, and others, to that purpo&s;e. But he had not credit enough it &s;eems, to gain his point: for An&s;elm was treated with all imaginable re&s;pect wherever he came. This famous archbi&s;hop was very &s;erviceable to the pope in
<PB N="210" REF="228">
the council of Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i, which was held to oppo&s;e the errors of the Greek church, with re&s;pect to the proce&s;&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t. In this &s;ynod An&s;elm an&s;wered the objections of the Greeks, and managed the argu|ment with &s;o much judgment, learning, and penetration, that he &s;ilen|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d his adver&s;aries, and gave general &s;atisfaction to the We&s;tern church. This argument was afterwards dige&s;ted by him into a tract, and is ex|tant among his other works.

After the &s;ynod of Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i was ended, the pope and An&s;elm returned to Rome, where an amba&s;&s;ador from the king of England was arrived, in order to di&s;prove An&s;elm's allegations and complaints again&s;t his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ter. And, the better to effect his purpo&s;e, he tried the intere&s;t of his pur&s;e; and partly by pre&s;ents, and partly by promi&s;es, he bribed the court of Rome to de&s;ert An&s;elm. The archbi&s;hop, per|ceiving how matters went, would have returned to Lyons, but the pope would not part with him; and to &s;weeten him after his di&s;appointment, lodged him in a noble palace, where his holine&s;s made him frequent vi&s;its. About that time the pope having &s;ummoned a council to fit at Rome, An&s;elm had a very honourable &s;eat a&s;&s;igned him and his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors; this being the fir&s;t time of an archbi&s;hop of Canterbury's appear|ing at a Roman &s;ynod. When the council broke up, An&s;elm immedi|ately left Rome, and returned to Lyons, where he was entertained for &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> time by Hugo, the archbi&s;hop. He &s;taid there till he heard the news of king William's and Pope Urban's death, which happened not long after. Henry I. the new king of England, having re&s;tored the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of Canterbury, Winche&s;ter, and Sali&s;bury, which had been &s;eized by his predece&s;&s;or, An&s;elm was &s;olicited to return into England; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing come as far as Clugny, an agent from the king met him with a letter inviting him to return to his archbi&s;hopric. In this letter the king <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s;ed him&s;elf for not &s;taying till An&s;elm's return, and being crowned by another prelate. The archbi&s;hop being arrived in England, was re|ceived with extraordinary re&s;pect by the king and the people, and thus for matters went &s;moothly enough. But when it was required of An|&s;elm, that he &s;hould be re-inve&s;ted by the king, and do the cu&s;tomary homage of his predece&s;&s;ors, he refu&s;ed to comply, alledging the canons of the late &s;ynod at Rome about inve&s;titures. The king was greatly di&s;g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed at An&s;elm's non-compliance: however, not being well &s;ettled on the throne, he was unwilling to come to a rupture. It was agreed, therefore, that the di&s;pute &s;hould re&s;t till the Ea&s;ter following: and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> time both parties were to &s;end their agents to Rome, to try if they could per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de the pope to di&s;pen&s;e with the canons of the late &s;ynod
<PB N="211" REF="229">
in relation to inve&s;titures. About this time An&s;elm &s;ummoned a &s;ynod to meet at Lambeth, on occa&s;ion of the king's intended marriage with Maud or Matilda, elde&s;t daughter of Malcolm king of Scotland. In this &s;ynod it was determined, that the king might lawfully marry that prince&s;s, notwith&s;tanding &s;he was generally reported to be a nun, hav|ing worn the veil, and had her education in a religious hou&s;e. Soon after this marriage, An&s;elm was of &s;ignal &s;ervice to King Henry again&s;t his brother the Duke of Normandy, who invaded England, and landed with a formidable army at Port&s;mouth. For the archbi&s;hop not only furni&s;hed the king with a large body of men, but was very active, like|wi&s;e, in preventing a revolt from him. The agents, &s;ent by the king and the archbi&s;hop to Rome, being returned, brought with them a letter from Pope Pa&s;chal to the king, in which his holine&s;s ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e with the canons concerning inve&s;titures. The king, on his part, re&s;olved not to give up what for &s;ome reigns had pa&s;&s;ed for part of the royal prerogative. And thus the difference was kept on foot between the king and An&s;elm. In this di&s;pute the majority of the bi&s;hops and temporal nobility were on the court &s;ide: and &s;ome of them were very earne&s;t with the king, to break entirely with the &s;ee of Rome. However, it was not thought advi&s;eable to proceed to an open rupture, without trying a farther expedient; and therefore fre&s;h agents were di&s;patched by the king to Rome, with in&s;tructions to offer the pope this alternative; either to depart from his former declaration, and relax in the point of inve&s;titures, or to be content with the bani&s;hment of An&s;elm, and to lo&s;e the obedience of the Engli&s;h, and the yearly profits accruing from that kingdom. At the &s;ame time, An&s;elm di&s;patched two monks, to inform the pope of the menaces of the Engli&s;h court. But the king's amba&s;&s;adors could not prevail with the pope to recede from his declaration; his holine&s;s prote&s;ting he would &s;ooner lo&s;e his life than cancel the decrees of the holy fathers: which re&s;olution he &s;ig|nified&punc; by letters to the king and An&s;elm. Soon after the king, having convened the great men of the kingdom at London, &s;ent An&s;elm word, that he mu&s;t either comply with the u&s;ages of his father's reign, or quit England. But the agents di&s;agreeing in their report of the pope's an&s;wer, An&s;elm thought proper not to return a po&s;itive an&s;wer, till farther information. And thus the controver&s;y &s;lept for the pre&s;ent. The next year a national &s;ynod was held under An&s;elm at St. Peter's, We&s;tmin&s;ter; at which the king and the principal nobility were pre&s;ent. The year following the king was plea&s;ed to relent, and de&s;ire An&s;elm to take a journey to Rome, to try if he could per&s;uade the pope to relax. An&s;elm, at the reque&s;t of the bi&s;hops and barons, undertook the voyage. At the &s;ame time, the king di&s;patched one William Warelwa&s;t to Rome.
<PB N="212" REF="230">
This agent, arriving there before An&s;elm, &s;olicited for the king his ma&s;ter, but to no purpo&s;e; for the pope per&s;i&s;ted in refu&s;ing to grant the king the right of inve&s;titure. But at the &s;ame time his holine&s;s, wrote a very ceremonious letter to the king of England, entreating him to wave the conte&s;t, and promi&s;ing all imaginable compliance in other matters. An&s;elm having taken leave of the court of Rome, returned to Lyons, where he received a &s;harp and reprimanding letter from a monk, acquainting him with the lamentable condition of the province of Canterbury. During the archbi&s;hop's &s;tay at Lyons, the king &s;ent another emba&s;&s;y to Rome, to try if he could prevail with the pope to being An&s;elm to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But the pope, in&s;tead of being gained, excommunicated &s;ome of the Engli&s;h court, who had di&s;&s;uaded the king from parting with the inve&s;titures. However, his holine&s;s declined pronouncing any cen&s;ure again&s;t the king. An&s;elm perceiving the court of Rome dilatory in its proceedings, removed from Lyons, and made a vi&s;it to the Counte&s;s Adela, the Conqueror's daughter, at her ca&s;tle in Blois. This lady inquiring into the bu&s;ine&s;s of An&s;elm's jour|ney, he told her that, after a great deal of patience and expectation, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t now be forced to excommunicate the king of England. The counte&s;s was extremely concerned for her brother, and wrote to the pope to procure an accommodation. The king, who was come into Nor|mandy, hearing that An&s;elm de&s;igned to excommunicate him, de&s;ired his &s;i&s;ter to bring him with her into Normandy, with a promi&s;e of con|de&s;cen&s;ion in &s;everal articles. To this An&s;elm agreed, and waited upon the king at a ca&s;tle called L'Aigle, where the king re&s;tored to him the revenues of the archbi&s;hopric, but would not permit him to come into England, unle&s;s he would comply in the affair of the inve&s;titures: which An&s;elm refu&s;ing to do, continued in France, till the matter was once more laid before the pope. And now the Engli&s;h bi&s;hops, who had taken part with the court again&s;t An&s;elm, began to change their minds, as appears by their letter to him in Normandy. In this letter, after having &s;et forth the deplorable &s;tate of the church, they pre&s;s him to come over with all &s;peed, promi&s;ing to &s;tand by him, and pay him the regard due to his character: it is &s;ub&s;cribed by Gerrard archbi&s;hop of York, Robert bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, Herbert bi&s;hop of Norwich, Ralph bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, Samp&s;on bi&s;hop of Worce&s;ter, and William elect of Winche&s;ter. An&s;elm expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction at this conduct of the bi&s;hops, but acquainted them that it was not in his power to return, till he was further informed of the proceedings of the court of Rome. In the mean time, being informed, that the king had fined &s;ome of the clergy for a late breach of the canons, he wrote to his highne&s;s to com|plain of that &s;tretch of his prerogative. At length the amba&s;&s;adors re|turned
<PB N="213" REF="231">
from Rome, and brought with them a deci&s;ion more agreeable than the former: for now the pope thought fit to make &s;ome advances towards gratifying the king; and though he would not give up the point of inve&s;titures, yet he di&s;pen&s;ed &s;o far as to give the bi&s;hops and abbots leave to do homage for their temporalities. The king, who was highly plea&s;ed with this conde&s;cen&s;ion in the pope, &s;ent immediately to invite An&s;elm into England: but the me&s;&s;enger finding him &s;ick, the king him&s;elf went over into Normandy, and made him a vi&s;it at the abbey of Becc; where all differences between them were perfectly adju&s;ted. And now An&s;elm, being recovered from his &s;ickne&s;s, embarked for England, and, landing at Dover, was received with extraordinary marks of welcome. To omit other circum&s;tances of re&s;pect, the queen her&s;elf travelled before him upon the road, to provide for his better entertain|ment. From this time nothing remarkable happened in the life of this famous archbi&s;hop, excepting only his conte&s;t with Thomas elected archbi&s;hop of York, who endeavoured to di&s;engage him&s;elf from a de|pendency upon the &s;ee of Canterbury. Before the termination of this di&s;pute, An&s;elm died at Canterbury, in the &s;eventy-&s;ixth year of his age, and the &s;eventeenth of his prelacy, on the twenty-fir&s;t of April, A. D. 1109. This great prelate was author of &s;everal pieces. The large&s;t edition of his works is that publi&s;hed by Father Gerberon. It is divided into three parts. The fir&s;t of the&s;e containing Dogmatical Tracts, is intitled Monologia. The &s;econd part contains practical and devotional tracts. The third part takes in An&s;elm's letters, in four books. As to the character of archbi&s;hop An&s;elm, it may be partly collected from the circum&s;tances of his life above recited. He has been much prai&s;ed for the re&s;olution he &s;hewed in the di&s;putes he had with William Rufus and Henry I. Where he believed the rights of the church and the intere&s;t of religion concerned, no greatne&s;s, no menaces of princes, nor pro&s;pect of danger, could di&s;courage him in the pur&s;uit of his point. Malme&s;bury tells us, he was a per&s;on of great &s;trictne&s;s and &s;elf-denial: his temper and &s;edatene&s;s were &s;uch, that, after he turned monk, he never was heard to utter the lea&s;t reproachful word. This archbi&s;hop was the fir&s;t who re&s;trained the Engli&s;h clergy from marrying. He was canonized in the reign of Henry VII. at the in&s;tance of Cardinal Morton, then arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury. Johannes Sari&s;burien&s;is, who wrote the life of archbi&s;hop An&s;elm, has recorded &s;everal miracles &s;aid to be wrought by him. Particularly he tells us, that a Flemi&s;h nobleman was cured of a lepro&s;y by drinking the water, in which An&s;elm had wa&s;hed his hands in celebrating the ma&s;s: that he extingui&s;hed fires, calmed tempe&s;ts, and healed di&s;ea&s;es only by making the &s;ign of the cro&s;s: that he re&s;cued a hare, which had taken refuge under his hor&s;e's feet, by commanding

the&s;e early and &s;peedy promotions, from his connection with the Earl of Macclesfield, then lord chancellor of England, yet it can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed that they could have been &s;o quickly attained, in a time of peace, if he had not given peculiar proofs of merit in his profe&s;&s;ion. Soon after his appointment to the Scarborough, he was ordered in her to South Carolina, in which &s;tation he continued for three years; and while he re&s;ided in that province, he erected a town, An&s;on Bourgh, and gave name to a county, which is &s;till called An&s;on County. After his return from his &s;ettlement in South Carolina, he always &s;poke with &s;atisfaction both of that country and its inhabitants. Being commanded home in October, 1727, he returned to England in the following &s;pring, and was paid off in May, 1728. On the 11th of October in the &s;ame year, Mr. An&s;on was appointed captain of the Garland man of war, and went out in her to South Carolina; from whence he was ordered back, in December, 1729, and the &s;hip was put out of commi&s;&s;ion at Sheerne&s;s. However, having the good fortune to be well with Lord Torringto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Sir Charles Wager, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively fir&s;t lords of the admiralty, he did not remain long out of employ; for on the 19th of May, 1731, the com|mand of the Diamond, one of the Downs &s;quadron, was be&s;towed upon him: which command he held but about three months, the Diamond be|ing then paid off. On the 25th of January, 1731-2, he was again call|ed into public &s;ervice, and appointed captain of the Squirrel man of war; in which &s;hip he was ordered, in the following April, for South Carolina. This was the third time of his being placed upon that &s;tation, and it was probably peculiarly agreeable to him, on account of the pro|perty he had acquired, and the &s;ettlement he had made in the province. Here he continued till the &s;pring of the year 1735, when, in con&s;e|quence of an order, given in December, 1734, he returned to England; and, in the month of June, was paid off at Woolwich. It appears from &s;ome original letters of Mr. An&s;on to the board of admiralty, with the fight of which we have been favoured, that he conducted him&s;elf, in the&s;e &s;everal employments, with an ability and di&s;cretion which gave general &s;atisfaction. After his la&s;t return from South Carolina, we find that he had &s;taid at home between two and three years; it being the 9th of December, 1737, when he was put into the command of the Centurion. In this &s;hip, he was ordered in the February following, to the coa&s;t of Guinea; from which &s;tation he returned to his own country, by way of Barbadoes and South Carolina, on the 10th of July, 1739. It is evident from the journal of the Centurion, during this period, compared with the in&s;tructions given to Captain An&s;on, by the board of admiralty, that he executed, with great prudence and fidelity, the di|rections of government; and it is under&s;tood in the family, that he

obliged the French to de&s;i&s;t from their attempt to hinder our trade upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that coa&s;t, without coming to any action, at a time when it would have been very inconvenient to the Briti&s;h court to have had an open rupture with the court of France.</P>
<P>Mr. An&s;on's conduct, in his various &s;ituations and employments, had produced &s;o favourable a character of his capacity and &s;pirit, that when, in the war which broke out with Spain in 1739, it was determined to attack the American &s;ettlements of the Spaniards in the great Pacific ocean, and by this means to affect them in their mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible parts, he was from the beginning, fixed upon to be the commander of the fleet, which was de&s;igned for that purpo&s;e. As the hi&s;tory of this expedition, which laid the foundation of his future fortunes, hath in con&s;equence of the excellent account that has been written of it by the late Mr. Robins, and the curious and intere&s;ting nature of the &s;ubject, been more read than almo&s;t any other which hath ever appeared, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to give a detail of it in the pre&s;ent article. It is well known that he de|parted from St. Helen's on the 18th of September, 1740, at the head of a &s;quadron of five men of war, a &s;loop of war, and two victualling &s;hips; that he &s;topped fir&s;t at Madeira, then on the coa&s;t of Bra&s;il, and next at port St. Julian in Patagonia; that they encountered prodigious diffi|culties in doubling Cape Horn; that in this perilous pa&s;&s;age, the re|mainder of his fleet was &s;cattered from him, and part of it never joined him again; that, at length, he arrived at the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes; that from thence he proceeded to Peru, took the town of Paita, anchor|ed a few days at Quibo, &s;ailed to the coa&s;t of Mexico, and formed the de&s;ign of intercepting the Acapulco &s;hip; that, after &s;topping a while at the harbour of Chequetan, he determined to cro&s;s the Pacific ocean; that, at la&s;t, his &s;quadron was reduced to his own &s;ingle &s;hip, the Cen|turion, that he made &s;ome &s;tay at Tinian, one of the Ladrones or Marian i&s;lands, from which he immediately went to Macao; and that &s;ailing back from Macao, in que&s;t of the Manilla galleon, he had the good fortune of meeting with it and of taking it, on the 30th of June, 1743; that, after this enterprize, he returned to Canton, from whence he embark|ed to England by the Cape of Good Hope; that, having completed his voyage round the world, he came &s;afe to an anchor at Spithead, on the 15th of June, 1744; and that he executed the whole of the under|taking with &s;ingular honour and advantage to him&s;elf, and the officers and people under him, though, from original errors and defects in the embarkation, and from cau&s;es in which he was in no wi&s;e concerned, the grand de&s;ign of the expedition was not fully an&s;wered. If any of our readers &s;hould happen to be unacquainted with the&s;e tran&s;actions, they will have recour&s;e to the account of them at large, that has been publi&s;hed

under the name of Mr. Walter; it being only our intention to &s;elect &s;uch circum&s;tances as have a more immediate relation to the per&s;onal character of Mr. An&s;on, and which indicate the turn of his mind. As before he &s;et &s;ail upon the expedition, he took care to furni&s;h him&s;elf with the printed journals of the voyages to the South Seas, and the be&s;t manu&s;cript accounts he could procure of all the Spani&s;h &s;ettlements upon the coa&s;ts of Chili, Peru, and Mexico, which he afterwards care|fully compared with the examinations of his pri&s;oners, and the informa|tion of &s;everal intelligent per&s;ons, who fell into his hands; &s;o, through the whole enterprize, he acted with a remarkable di&s;cretion, and with a calm|ne&s;s which particularly di&s;tingui&s;hes his character. When he was ready to depart from St. Catharine's, and con&s;idered that his own &s;hip might po&s;&s;ibly be lo&s;t, or di&s;abled from getting round Cape Horn, he gave &s;uch directions to the other commanders, as would have prevented the undertaking's being, even in that ca&s;e, abandoned. His huma|nity was di&s;played at the i&s;land of Juan Fernandes, in his a&s;&s;i&s;ting with his own labour, and obliging the officers, without di&s;tinction, to give a helping hand, in carrying the &s;ick &s;ailors in their hammocks, to &s;hore. At the &s;ame place he &s;owed lettuces, carrots, and other garden plants, and &s;et, in the woods, a great variety of plumb, apricot and peach-&s;tones, for the better accommodation of his countrymen who &s;hould hereafter touch there. From a like regard to future na|vigators, Commodore An&s;on was particularly indu&s;trious in directing the roads and coa&s;ts to be &s;urveyed, and other ob&s;ervations to be made; for he well knew by his own experience of the want of the&s;e materials, of how great con&s;equence they might prove to any Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els, which, in &s;ucceeding times, might be employed in tho&s;e &s;eas. His integrity and genero&s;ity in the treatment of &s;ome female pri&s;oners who had fallen into his hands, and his care to prevent their meeting with any degree of rudene&s;s, from a &s;et of &s;ailors who had not &s;een a woman for near a twelvemonth, are greatly to his honour. By the wi&s;e and proper u&s;e which he made of the intelligence he had obtained from &s;ome Spani&s;h captures, the Commodore was encouraged to form the de&s;ign of attacking the town of Paita; and his conduct in that attack, added much to his reputation. Such was the excellent di&s;cipline to which he had accu&s;tomed his men, that, in the taking of the town, only one man was found, who was known to have &s;o far neglected his duty as to get drunk. After the attack upon Paita, when a &s;pirit of envy and jealou&s;y aro&s;e concerning the di&s;tribution of the plunder, he manife&s;ted his prudence and equity in allaying this &s;pirit, and his liberality in giving up his own &s;hare. But there was nothing from which Mr. An&s;on derived greater per&s;onal credit, or which reflected greater
<PB N="218" REF="236">
glory upon the Engli&s;h nation, than his behaviour to his pri&s;oners in general, and e&s;pecially to the women before mentioned. This beha|viour was &s;o honourable in it&s;elf, and &s;o beneficent in its con&s;equences, that it de&s;erves to be particularly noticed. Though his force was ren|dered weak by the &s;ickne&s;s and death of numbers of his men, and by the &s;eparation or lo&s;s of the larger part of his &s;mall &s;quadron, we find that he was always intent upon contriving &s;ome &s;cheme or other, by which, if po&s;&s;ible, the de&s;ign of his expedition might be an&s;wered. When no purpo&s;e was likely to be effectual, but the taking of the Aca|pulco &s;hip, he pur&s;ued that plan with the greate&s;t &s;agacity and per&s;e|verance. In no in&s;tance was the fortitude of his mind more tried, than when the Centurion was driven out to &s;ea, from the uninhabited i&s;land of Tinian; him&s;elf, many of the officers, and part of the crew being left on &s;hore. Neverthele&s;s, in this gloomy and di&s;con&s;olate &s;ituation, he pre&s;erved his u&s;ual compo&s;ure and &s;teadine&s;s, though he could not be without his &s;hare of inward di&s;quietude. He calmly applied to every mea&s;ure which was likely to keep up the courage of his men, and to facilitate their departure from the i&s;land. He per&s;onally engaged in the mo&s;t laborious part of the work which was nece&s;&s;ary to the con|&s;tructing of a ve&s;&s;el for this purpo&s;e; and it was only upon the plea&s;ing and unexpected news of the return of the Centurion, that, throwing down his axe, he by his joy broke through, for the fir&s;t time, the equable and unvaried character which he had hitherto pre&s;erved. Commodore An&s;on, when he was at Macao, exerted great &s;pirit and addre&s;s in procuring the nece&s;&s;ary aid from the Chine&s;e, for the re|&s;itting of his &s;hip. In the &s;cheme of taking the Manilla galleon, and in the actual taking of it, he di&s;played united wi&s;dom and courage; nor did the accu&s;tomed calmne&s;s of his mind for&s;ake him on a mo&s;t trying and critical occa&s;ion; when, in the moment of victory, the Cen|turion was dangerou&s;ly on fire near the powder-room. During his &s;ub&s;equent &s;tay at Canton, he acted, in all re&s;pects, with the greate&s;t &s;pirit, and firmly maintained the privileges and honour of the Briti&s;h flag. The perils, with which he had &s;o often been threatened, pur|&s;ued him to the la&s;t; for on his arrival in England, he found that he had &s;ailed through the mid&s;t of a French fleet then cruizing in the Channel; from which he had the whole time been concealed by a fog. Thus was his expedition fini&s;hed, when it had la&s;ted three years and nine months; <Q REND="inline">'after having by its event,' &s;ays the writer of his voyage, '&s;trongly evinced this important truth, That though prudence, intre|pidity, and per&s;everance united, are not exempted from the blows of adver&s;e fortune; yet, in a long &s;eries of tran&s;actions, they u&s;ually ri&s;e &s;uperior to its power, and in the end rarely fail of proving &s;ucce&s;sful.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="237">Mr. An&s;on, a few days after his return to his own country, was made a rear admiral of the blue; and in a very &s;hort time, he was cho&s;en member of parliament for Heydon in York&s;hire. On the 27th of December, 1744, when the Duke of Bedford was appointed fir&s;t lord of the admiralty, he was appointed one of the commi&s;&s;ioners; and on the 23d of April in the following year, he was made a rear admiral of the white. On the 14th of July, 1746, he was rai&s;ed to the rank of vice-admiral. In the latter end of the year 1746, and the beginning of 1747, he commanded the &s;quadron in the Channel &s;ervice; and bore the inconveniences of a long and tempe&s;tuous win|ter navigation, with his u&s;ual per&s;everance. Nothing would have fru&s;trated the &s;ucce&s;s of this expedition, but the accidental intelligence which was given by the ma&s;ter of a Dutch ve&s;&s;el, to the Duke d'An|ville's fleet, of Admiral An&s;on's &s;tation and intention. However, being employed again early in the en&s;uing &s;pring, he had an opportu|nity of rendering a &s;ignal &s;ervice to his country. Being then on board the Prince George of 90 guns, with rear admiral Warren, in the De|von&s;hire, and twelve &s;hips more under his command, he intercepted, on the 3d of May, 1747, off Cape Fini&s;terre, a con&s;iderable fleet, bound from France to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and laden with mer|chandi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, trea&s;ure, and warlike &s;tores; and took &s;ix men of war, and four Ea&s;t Indiamen, not one of the enemy's &s;hips of war e&s;caping. By this great and &s;ucce&s;sful exploit, he defeated the pernicious de|&s;igns of two ho&s;tile expeditions, made a con&s;iderable addition to the force and the riches of our own kingdom, and thus converted into a public benefit, the intended means of a public calamity.

St. George, Captain of the Invincible, in allu&s;ion to the names of the two &s;hips which had been taken, and pointing to them at the &s;ame time, &s;aid, when he pre&s;ented his &s;word to the conqueror; <HI>Mon|&s;ieur, vouz avez vaincu</HI> l'invincible, <HI>et</HI> la gloire <HI>vous &s;uit.</HI> On the 13th of June following, his Maje&s;ty king George the &s;econd, in con&s;idera|tion of Mr. An&s;on's eminent &s;ervices, was plea&s;ed to rai&s;e him to the honour of an Engli&s;h peerage, by the &s;tyle and title of Lord An&s;on, Baron of Soberton in the county of Southampton; and his Lord&s;hip made choice of a motto, very happily &s;uited to the dangers he had gone through, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;es he had met with, <HI>Nil de&s;perandum.</HI> On the 25th of April, 1748, he married Elizabeth, elde&s;t daughter of Philip Lord Hardwicke, at that time Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, which lady died without i&s;&s;ue, on the fir&s;t of June, 1760. He had frequently the honour of convoying the late king from England to Holland. The fir&s;t time was in the year 1748; and ever after he con|&s;tantly attended his maje&s;ty on his going abroad, and on his return to
<PB N="220" REF="238">
this kingdom. On the 12th of July, 1749, his lord&s;hip was made vice-admiral of Great Britain, an appointment that is more of a civil than a military nature; but which neverthele&s;s, is always given to a military man. On the 12th of June, 1751, he was preferred to be fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the admiralty, in the room of the Earl of Sandwich; and in the years 1752 and 1755, he was one of the Lords Ju&s;tices of the kingdom, during his Maje&s;ty's ab&s;ence. The &s;quadrons fitted out in the la&s;t mentioned year, on the pro&s;pect of a war with France, were got ready with &s;ingular di&s;patch, the officers &s;ent to the ports ex|erting them&s;elves in a remarkable manner. That more &s;ucce&s;s did not attend them was owing to accidents. Mr. Bo&s;cawen commanded one divi&s;ion of the fleet, and Sir Edward Hawke the other; and both the&s;e gallant admirals always &s;erved with credit, often with the mo&s;t bril|liant &s;ucce&s;s. It was the run of the times, inflamed by party writers, to blame Lord An&s;on, for not &s;ending a fleet to relieve Minorca in time, when Port Mahon was be&s;ieged by the Duke of Richlieu; and it was alledged, that when he did &s;end one, it was not &s;trong enough. As to his not &s;ending it &s;ooner, this was occa&s;ioned in a great mea&s;ure by Mr. Bo&s;cawen's &s;quadron (on which we depended for a &s;upply of &s;eamen) not coming in, by &s;everal weeks, &s;o early as was expected. And after that the government was kept in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, by the alarms of an inva&s;ion, founded on very particular intelligence. With regard to the &s;trength of the fleet, the able&s;t &s;ea-officers (men who&s;e judgments no one could di&s;pute) always thought that the force under Byng was quite &s;ufficient. It was a match in numbers for the French admiral, and was a &s;quadron remarkably well appointed. To this may be add|ed, that neither the time of &s;ending a fleet, nor the &s;trength of it, de|pended &s;olely upon the fir&s;t lord of the admiralty, but mu&s;t have had the concurrent opinion of the whole cabinet. On the 16th of Novem|ber, 1756, Lord An&s;on, upon a change in the admini&s;tration, re&s;igned his po&s;t as fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the admiralty. A very accurate inquiry was made, in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, into the affair of Minorca; and the mini&s;try of that time were, by &s;everal re&s;olutions of the hou&s;e of commons, acquitted of any blame or neglect of duty. On the 24th of February, 1757, he was made an admiral; and on the 2d of July, he was again placed at the head of the admiralty board, where he continued during the remainder of his life. He came in with his old friends, the Duke of Newca&s;tle and the Earl of Hardwicke, and in the mo&s;t honourable manner: for he renewed his &s;eat with the concurrence of every individual in the mini&s;try, Mr. Pitt re&s;uming the &s;eals as &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and with the particular approbation of king George the Second. All the re&s;t of his conduct, as fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the
<PB N="221" REF="239">
admiralty, was crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, under the mo&s;t glorious admini|&s;tration which this country ever &s;aw. The la&s;t time that Lord An&s;on commanded at &s;ea, was in 1758, to cover the expedition again&s;t the coa&s;t of France. Being then admiral of the white, and having hoi&s;ted his flag on board the Royal George of 100 guns, he &s;ailed from Spit|head on the fir&s;t of June, with a formidable fleet, Sir Edward Hawke &s;erving under him; and by continually cruizing before Bre&s;t, he pro|tected the &s;everal de&s;cents which were made that &s;ummer at St. Maloes, Cherburg, &amp;c. The French fleet not venturing to come out, he kept his own &s;quadron and &s;eamen in con&s;tant exerci&s;e; a thing, which he thought, had been too much di&s;regarded. On the 30th of July, 1761, his lord&s;hip was rai&s;ed to the dignity of admiral and commander in chief of the fleet; and in a few days he &s;ailed from Harwich, in the Char|lotte yacht, to convoy her pre&s;ent maje&s;ty to England; whom he land|ed, after a rough and tedious pa&s;&s;age, on the 7th of September. In Fe|bruary, 1762, he went to Port&s;mouth to accompany the Queen's brother, Prince Charles of Mecklenburgh, and to &s;hew him the ar&s;enal, and the fleet which was then upon the point of &s;ailing, under the command of Sir George Pocock, for the Havanna. Lord An&s;on, in attending the Prince, caught a violent cold, that was accompanied with a gouty di&s;order, under which he langui&s;hed two or three months. This cold, at length, &s;ettled upon his lungs, and was the immediate cau&s;e of his death. He died, at his &s;eat at Moorpark, in Hertford&s;hire, on the 6th of June, 1762, and was buried in the family vault at Colwich. Be&s;ides the other honours we have mentioned, he was a member of his maje&s;ty's privy council, one of the elder brethren of Trinity-hou&s;e, and a gover|nor of the charter-hou&s;e. He was very a&s;&s;iduous at the admiralty board, and remarkably quick in making naval di&s;po&s;itions of every kind, and in appropriating the proper &s;trength and proper &s;ort of &s;hips to the dif|ferent &s;ervices. He liked to &s;ee his table filled with the gentlemen of the navy; and many eminent and valuable men of that profe&s;&s;ion frequently met there. Among the various &s;ervices which will render the name of An&s;on illu&s;trious, his di&s;creet and &s;ucce&s;sful choice of officers de&s;erves particularly to be mentioned; as will be allowed by all who recollect, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, as Sir Charles Saunders, Captain Saumarez, Sir Percy Brett, Admiral Keppel, Sir Peter Denis, Admiral Campbell, and others, were either his lieutenants in the Centurion, or &s;erved under him on different occa&s;ions. He may, in general, be &s;aid to have been a true friend and patron to men of real merit and capacity in the &s;ervice. In a late work, the editor of which hath taken very little pains to obtain authentic information concerning the per&s;ons treated of, it is a&s;&s;erted;
<Q>'that Lord An&s;on, at home, le&s;&s;ened his great reputation
<PB N="222" REF="240">
by a fooli&s;h attachment to gaming; that, having &s;een little of the polite world, he ea&s;ily became the dupe of &s;harpers in high life, who ea&s;ed him of a con&s;iderable &s;hare of his wealth: and that the ridicule he in|curred upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, it is thought, affected his &s;pirits, and contributed not a little, to bring on that decline which &s;hortened his days.'</Q>
But we have the be&s;t authority for &s;aying, that this repre&s;en|tation of things is as fal&s;e as it is injurious to his lord&s;hip's character. Upon the whole, he neither won nor lo&s;t by gaming; and he made it, like hundreds of others, who pa&s;s uncen&s;ured, his amu&s;ement rather than his bu&s;ine&s;s. To affirm, that any ridicule affected his &s;pirits, is an ab&s;olutely groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertion. The great regard which was &s;hewn him in all the companies he frequented, mu&s;t put his memory above &s;uch an a&s;per&s;ion. Lord An&s;on left his whole fortune to his brother, Tho|mas An&s;on, E&s;q. who was member of parliament for Litchfield, and with whom he had always lived in the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip. This gentle|man was well known for his liberal patronage of, and his exqui&s;ite &s;kill in the fine arts.

<P>A very learned phy&s;ician and chemi&s;t in the latter end of the &s;ixteenth and beginning of the &s;eventeenth centuries. His father was an eminent gold&s;mith in the city of London, and had an employment of con&s;ider|able value in the jewel-office under the reign of Queen Elizabeth. This &s;on of his was born April 16, 1550; and having been carefully in&s;tructed in the fir&s;t rudiments of learning while at home, was, about the year 1569, &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, where he &s;tudied with great diligence and &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;ome time in the year 1574, took the degree of ma&s;ter of arts. It appears from his own writings, that he applied him&s;elf, for many years that he &s;tudied in that univer&s;ity, to the theory and practice of chemi&s;try, with &s;edulous indu&s;try, and made no &s;mall progre&s;s. It is not at all clear from any memoirs that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave reached our hands, when he left Cambridge and came up to Lon|don; but it &s;eems highly probable, that it was not before he attained the age of forty.

About a month after he was com|mitted to the Counter-pri&s;on, and fined in the &s;um of five pounds, <HI>propter illicitam Praxin,</HI> that is, for pre&s;cribing phy&s;ic again&s;t the &s;tatutes and privilege of the college; but upon his application to the lord chief ju&s;tice, he was &s;et at liberty, which gave &s;o great an umbrage to the college, that the pre&s;ident and one of the cen&s;ors waited on the chief ju&s;tice, to reque&s;t his favour in defending and pre&s;erving the col|lege privileges; upon which Mr. Anthony &s;ubmitted him&s;elf, promi&s;ed to pay his fine, and was forbidden practice. But not long after he was accu&s;ed again of practi&s;ing phy&s;ic, and, upon his own confe&s;&s;ion, was fined five pounds; which fine, on his refu&s;ing to pay it, was increa&s;ed to twenty pounds, and he committed to pri&s;on till he paid it; neither were the college &s;atisfied with this, but commenced a &s;uit at law again&s;t him in the name of the Queen, as well as of the college, in which they prevailed, and obtained judgment again&s;t him; but after &s;ome time, were prevailed upon by the intreaties of his wife, to remit their &s;hare of the penalty, as appears by their warrant to the keeper of the pri&s;on for his di&s;charge, dated under the college &s;eal the 6th of Augu&s;t, 1602. After his relea&s;e he &s;eems to have met with con&s;iderable patrons, who were able to protect him from the authority of the college; and though Dr. Goodal tells us, that this learned &s;ociety thought him weak and ig|norant in phy&s;ic, yet it &s;eems there were other learned bodies of another opinion; &s;ince after all the&s;e cen&s;ures, and being to&s;&s;ed about from pri&s;on to pri&s;on, he became doctor of phy&s;ic in our own univer&s;ities. This did not hinder new complaints being brought again&s;t him, by Dr. Tay|lor, and another phy&s;ician, who grounded their proceedings chiefly on his giving a certain no&s;trum, which he called <HI>Aurum potabile,</HI> or potable gold, and which he repre&s;ented to the world, as an univer&s;al medicine. There were at this time al&s;o &s;everal things written again&s;t him, and his manner of practice, in&s;inuating that he was very inaccurate in his method of philo&s;ophi&s;ing; that the virtues of metals, as to phy&s;ical u&s;es, were very uncertain; and that the boa&s;ted effects of this medicine were de&s;titute of proof. Dr. Anthony, upon this, publi&s;hed a very learned and mode&s;t defence of him&s;elf and his <HI>Aurum potabile,</HI> in Latin, written with great decency, much &s;kill in chemi&s;try, and with an apparent knowledge in the theory and hi&s;tory of phy&s;ic. This book, which he publi&s;hed in 1610, was printed at the univer&s;ity pre&s;s of Cambridge, and had a very florid dedication to king James prefixed. He likewi&s;e
<PB N="224" REF="242">
annexed &s;uch certificates of cures, under the hands of &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and &s;ome too of the faculty, that it very plainly appeared, he did not by any means de&s;erve to be treated as an ignorant empiric, or a mere pretender to chemi&s;try. His book, however, was quickly an|&s;wered, and the controver&s;y about <HI>Aurum potabile</HI> grew &s;o warm, that he was obliged to publi&s;h another apology in the Engli&s;h language, which was al&s;o tran&s;lated into Latin, and is &s;till in great e&s;teem abroad; yet here at home it was far from an&s;wering the doctor's expectation, for it did not at all abate the oppo&s;ition formed again&s;t his practice by the faculty, or allay that bitterne&s;s with which his opponents treated his argument, and writings. But, con&s;idered in another light, it proved very advantageous to him; for it procured the general good-will of or|dinary readers, and contributed exceedingly to &s;upport and extend his practice, notwith&s;tanding all the pains taken to decry it. Yet what chiefly contributed to maintain his own reputation, and thereby reflected credit on his medicine, was his unblemi&s;hed character in private life. For our Dr. Anthony was a man of unaffected piety, untainted probity, of ea&s;y addre&s;s, great mode&s;ty, and boundle&s;s charity; which procured him many friends, and left it not in the power of his enemies to attack any part of his conduct, except that of di&s;pen&s;ing a medicine, of which they had no opinion. It is not either our inclination, or agreeable to the de&s;ign of this work, to enter deeply into this controver&s;y; but it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that though much has been &s;aid to di&s;credit the u&s;e of gold in medicine, yet &s;ome very able and ingenious men have written very plau&s;ibly in &s;upport of tho&s;e principles on which Dr. An|thony's practice was founded. The age in which Dr. Anthony flouri&s;h|ed was very favourable to his notion, &s;ince chemi&s;try was then full as much admired, though perhaps not &s;o well under&s;tood as at pre&s;ent. He had, therefore, a very exten&s;ive and beneficial practice, which enabled him to live ho&s;pitably at his hou&s;e in Bartholomew-clo&s;e, and to be very liberal in his alms to the poor. He died on the 26th of May, 1623, in the 74th year of his age, and was buried in the church of St. Bartholomew the great, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the i&s;le which joins to the north &s;ide of the chancel, where a hand&s;ome monument has been erected to his memory, with a &s;uitable in&s;cription.

<HEAD>ANTINOUS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS celebrated youth lived in the reign of Adrian, and has been univer&s;ally celebrated for his unrivalled beauty. And indeed if the &s;ta|tues, intaglios, and other remains of antiquity, which were de&s;igned to perpetuate his memory, may be thought faithfully to repre&s;ent his per|&s;on, no one can di&s;pute his claim to external loveline&s;s. But Antinous lived in an age when beauty was more dangerous to male than to female youth. The emperor beheld his blooming graces with the eyes of in|famous de&s;ire: and if nature could permit us to &s;uppo&s;e reciprocity in &s;uch dete&s;table attachments, it would &s;eem that the youth returned the affection of his ma&s;ter with an equal ardour. The unbridled and extra|vagant pa&s;&s;ion of Adrian was as bla&s;phemous as it was otherwi&s;e abhor|rent; for at the death of this minion, he not only in his own per&s;on devoted to him that wor&s;hip which was due to God, but cau&s;ed divine honours to be paid him through all the regions of his exten&s;ive empire. It appears from divers authors that attributes of Mercury, of Apollo, and of Bacchus, were a&s;cribed to him; and that learned antiquarian, Mr. Bowman, in his di&s;&s;ertation on an intaglio of Antinous under the figure of Mercury, gives us good rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e he was honoured by the Egyptians as their Annubius. The manner of his death is variou&s;ly re|lated&mdash; &s;ome authors in&s;i&s;ting that he offered his life a voluntary &s;acrifice for the emperor, upon the ab&s;urd pagan notion that by &s;uch means he might prolong the fated date of the friend who was dear to him; others relate, that from the &s;ame motive he yielded him&s;elf a ready victim for the completion of certain my&s;teries of magic in which Adrian was engaged; while a third cla&s;s a&s;&s;ert, that he drowned him&s;elf in the Nile, on account of Adrian's long &s;tay in Egypt. Be this as it will, the emperor lamented him with tears and angui&s;h; deified him; had temples erected to him; appointed prie&s;ts and prophets to officiate in his wor&s;hip, and deliver his &s;uppo&s;ed oracles; had the town in which he was reputed to have died, rebuilt and called by his name; and being told that a new &s;tar had made its appearance in the heavens, he affirmed it to be the &s;oul of this favourite.</P>

<HEAD>ANTONIDES VANDER GOES (JOHN),</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent Dutch poet, born at Goes in Zealand, the 3d of April, 1647. His parents were anabapti&s;ts, people of good character, but of low circum&s;tances. They went to live at Am&s;terdam when Antonides was about four years old; and in the ninth year of his age he began his &s;tudies, under the direction of Adrian Junius and James Cocceius. Antonides took great plea&s;ure in reading the Latin poets, and carefully
<PB N="226" REF="244">
compared them with Grotius, Hein&s;ius, &amp;c. By this means he acquired a ta&s;te for poetry, and enriched his mind with noble ideas. He fir&s;t attempted to tran&s;late &s;ome pieces of Ovid, Horace, and other ancients; and having formed his ta&s;te on the&s;e excellent models, he at length un|dertook one of the mo&s;t difficult ta&s;ks in poetry, to write a tragedy; this was intitled Trazil, or The Inva&s;ion of China. Antonides how|ever was &s;o mode&s;t as not to permit it to be publi&s;hed. Vondel, who was then engaged in a dramatic piece, which was taken al&s;o from &s;ome event that happened in China, read Antonides's tragedy, and was &s;o well plea&s;ed with it, that he declared, if the author would not print it, he would take &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages out of it, and make u&s;e of them in his own tragedy, which he did accordingly; and it was reckoned much to the honour of Antonides, to have written what might be adopted by &s;o great a poet, as Vondel was acknowledged to be, by all good judges. Upon the conclu&s;ion of the peace betwixt Great Britain and Holland, in the year 1667, Antonides wrote a piece intitled Bellona aan band, <HI>i. e.</HI> Bellona chained, a very elegant poem, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal hundred ver&s;es. The applau&s;e with which this piece was received, excited him to try his genius in &s;omething more con&s;iderable: he accordingly wrote an epic poem, which he intitled The River Y. The de&s;cription of this river, or rather lake, is the &s;ubject of the poem, which is divided into four books; in the fir&s;t the poet gives a very pompous de&s;cription of all that is remarkable on that bank of the Y, on which Am&s;terdam is built. In the &s;econd he opens to him&s;elf a larger field; he begins with the prai&s;es of navigation, and de&s;cribes the large fleets which cover the Y, as an immen&s;e fore&s;t, and thence go to every part of the world, to bring home whatever may &s;atisfy the nece&s;&s;ity, the luxury, or pride of men. The third book is an ingenious fiction; which &s;uppo&s;es the poet all of a &s;udden carried to the bottom of the river Y, where he &s;ees the deity of the river, with his demi-gods and nymphs, adorning and dre&s;&s;|ing them&s;elves to go to a fea&s;t, which was to be celebrated at Neptune's court, upon the anniver&s;ary of the marriage of Thetis with Peleus. In the fourth book he de&s;cribes the other bank of the Y, adorned with &s;e|veral cities of North Holland; and in the clo&s;e of the work addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, to who&s;e wi&s;dom he a&s;cribes the riches and flouri&s;hing condition of that powerful city.</P>
<P>Antonides's parents had bred him up an apothecary; but his remark|able genius for poetry &s;oon gained him the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and particularly of Mr. Bui&s;ero, one of the lords of the admiralty at Am&s;terdam, and a great lover of poetry who &s;ent him at his expence to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies at Leyden, where h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remained till he took his degree of doctor of phy&s;ic, and then his patro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

gave him a place in the admiralty. In the year 1678, Antonides mar|ried Su&s;anna Bermans, a mini&s;ter's daughter, who had al&s;o a talent for poetry. His marriage was celebrated by &s;everal eminent poets, parti|cularly by the celebrated Peter Francius, profe&s;&s;or of eloquence, who compo&s;ed &s;ome Latin ver&s;es on the occa&s;ion. Antonides, in the pre|face to his heroic poem, promi&s;ed the life of the apo&s;tle Paul, which, like Virgil's Aeneid, was to be divided into twelve books; but he never fini&s;hed that de&s;ign, for only a few fragments of it have appeared, and the rea&s;on he gave for not bringing it to a conclu&s;ion, was, that he dur&s;t not meddle with theological &s;ubjects, being per&s;uaded, whatever mode|ration he &s;hould ob&s;erve, he mu&s;t di&s;plea&s;e &s;ome party. After mar|riage, he did not much indulge his poetic genius; and within a few years he fell into a con&s;umption, of which he died on the 18th of Sep|tember, 1684, being then but thirty-&s;even years and a few months old. He is e&s;teemed the mo&s;t eminent Dutch poet, after Vondel, whom he &s;tudied to imitate, and is thought to have excelled in &s;weetne&s;s of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and &s;moothne&s;s of &s;tyle; but in accuracy and loftine&s;s he is greatly inferior to his original. His works have been printed &s;everal times, having been collected by his father, Anthony Tan&s;z. The la&s;t edition was printed by Nicholas Ten Hoom, at Am&s;terdam, in the year 1714, in quarto, under the direction of David Van Hoog&s;traaten, one of the ma&s;ters of the Latin &s;chool of that city, who added to it al&s;o the life of the poet.</P>

<HEAD>ANTONINUS PHILOSOPHUS (MARCUS AURELIUS),</HEAD>
<P>THE Roman emperor, born at Rome, the 26th of April, in the 121&s;t year of the Chri&s;tian aera. He was called by &s;everal names, till he was admitted into the Aurelian family, when he took the name of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus. Hadrian, upon the death of Cejonius Commodus, turned his eyes upon Marcus Aurelius, but as he was not then eighteen years of age, and con&s;equently too young for &s;o important a &s;tation, he fixed upon Antoninus Pius, whom he adopted, upon condition that he &s;hould likewi&s;e adopt Marcus Aurelius. The year after this adoption, Hadrian appointed him que&s;tor, though he had not yet attained the age pre&s;cribed by the laws. After the death of Hadrian, Aurelius married Fau&s;tina, the daughter of Antoninus Pius, by whom he had &s;e|veral children. In the year 139, he was inve&s;ted with new honours by the emperor Pius, in which he behaved in &s;uch a manner, as endeared him to that prince, and the whole people.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Pius, which happened in the year 161, he was obliged by the &s;enate to take upon him the government, in the manage|ment of which he took Lucius Verus as his colleague. Dion Ca&s;&s;ius
<PB N="228" REF="246">
&s;ays, that the rea&s;on of doing this, was that he might have lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue his &s;tudies, and on account of his ill &s;tate of health; Lucius be|ing of a &s;trong vigorous con&s;titution, and con&s;equently more fit for the fatigues of war. The &s;ame day he took upon him the name of Anto|ninus, which he gave likewi&s;e to Verus his colleague, and betrothed his daughter Lucilla to him. The two emperors went afterwards to the camp, where, after having performed the funeral rites of Pius, they pro|nounced each of them a panegyric to his memory. They di&s;charged the government in a very amicable manner. It is &s;aid, that &s;oon after Antoninus had performed the apotheo&s;is of Pius, petitions were pre&s;ented to him by the pagan prie&s;ts, philo&s;ophers and governors of provinces, in order to excite him to per&s;ecute the Chri&s;tians, which he rejected with indignation; and interpo&s;ed his authority to their protection, by writing a letter to the common a&s;&s;embly of A&s;ia, then held at Ephe&s;us. The happine&s;s which the empire began to enjoy under the two emperors, was interrupted in the year 162, by a dreadful inundation of the Tiber, which de&s;troyed a va&s;t number of cattle, and occa&s;ioned a famine at Rome. This calamity was followed by the Parthian war; and at the &s;ame time the Catti ravaged Germany and Rhaetia. Lucius Verus went in per&s;on to oppo&s;e the Parthians, and Antoninus continued at Rome, where his pre&s;ence was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>During this war with the Parthians, about the year 163 or 164, An|toninus &s;ent his daughter Lucilla to Verus, &s;he having been betrothed to him in marriage, and attended her as far as Brundu&s;ium; he intended to have conducted her to Syria; but it having been in&s;inuated by &s;ome per&s;ons, that his de&s;ign of going into the ea&s;t, was to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the honour of having fini&s;hed the Parthian war, he returned to Rome. The Ro|mans having gained a victory over the Parthians, who were obliged to abandon Me&s;opotamia, the two emperors triumphed over them at Rome, in the year 166, and were honoured with the title of Fa|thers of their Country. This year was fatal, on account of a terrible pe&s;tilence which &s;pread it&s;elf over the whole world, and a famine under which Rome laboured; it was likewi&s;e in this year that the Marco|manni, and many other people of Germany, took up arms again&s;t the Romans; but the two emperors having marched in per&s;on again&s;t them, obliged the Germans to &s;ue for peace. The war, however, was renewed the year following, and the two emperors marched again in per&s;on; but Lucius Verus was &s;eized with an apoplectic fit, and died at Altinum.</P>
<P>In the year 170, Antoninus made va&s;t preparations again&s;t the Ger|mans, and carried on the war with great vigour. During this war, in 174, a very extraordinary event is &s;aid to have happened, which, ac|cording to Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, was as follows: Antoninus's army being block|ed
<PB N="229" REF="247">
up by the Quadi, in a very di&s;advantageous place, where there was no po&s;&s;ibility of procuring water; in this &s;ituation, being worn out with fatigue and wounds, oppre&s;&s;ed with heat and thir&s;t, and incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy, in an in&s;tant the &s;ky was covered with clouds, and there fell a va&s;t quantity of rain: the Roman army were about to quench their thir&s;t, when the enemy came upon them with &s;uch fury, that they certainly mu&s;t have been defeated, had it not been for a &s;hower of hail, accompanied with a &s;torm of thunder and lightning, which fell upon the enemy, without the lea&s;t annoyance to the Romans, who by this means gained the victory. In 175, Antoni|nus made a treaty with &s;everal nations of Germany. Soon after, Avi|dius Ca&s;&s;ius, governor of Syria, revolted from the emperor: this in&s;ur|rection, however, was put an end to by the death of Ca&s;&s;ius, who was killed by a centurion named Anthony. Antoninus behaved with great lenity towards tho&s;e who had been engaged in Ca&s;&s;ius's party: he would not put to death, nor impri&s;on, nor even &s;it in judgment him&s;elf upon any of the &s;enators engaged in this revolt; but he referred them to the &s;enate, fixing a day for their appearance, as if it had been only a civil affair. He wrote al&s;o to the &s;enate, de&s;iring them to act with in|dulgence rather than &s;everity; not to &s;hed the blood of any &s;enator or per&s;on of quality, or of any other per&s;on what&s;oever, but to allow this honour to his reign, that even under the misfortune of a rebellion, none had lo&s;t their lives, except in the fir&s;t heat of the tumult: "And I wi&s;h (&s;aid he) that I could even recall to life many of tho&s;e who have been killed; for revenge in a prince hardly ever plea&s;es, for even when ju&s;t, it is con&s;idered too &s;evere." In 176, Antoninus vi&s;ited Syria and Egypt: the kings of tho&s;e countries, and emba&s;&s;adors al&s;o from Parthia, came to vi&s;it him. He &s;tayed &s;everal days at Smyrna; and after he had &s;ettled the affairs of the ea&s;t, went to Athens, on which city he conferred &s;everal honours, and appointed public profe&s;&s;ors there. From thence he returned to Rome with his &s;on Commodus, whom he cho&s;e con&s;ul for the year following, though he was then but &s;ixteen years of age, having obtained a di&s;pen&s;ation for that purpo&s;e. On the 27th of September, the &s;ame year, he gave him the title of Imperator; and on the 23d of December, he entered Rome in triumph, with Commo|dus, on account of the victories gained over the Germans. Dion Ca&s;|&s;ius tells us, that he remitted all the debts which were due to him&s;elf and the public trea&s;ury during forty-&s;ix years, from the time that Ha|drian had granted the &s;ame favour, and burnt all the writings relating to tho&s;e debts. He applied him&s;elf likewi&s;e to correct many enormi|ties, and introduced &s;everal excellent regulations. In the year 178, he left Rome with his &s;on Commodus, in order to go again&s;t the Marco|manni,
<PB N="230" REF="248">
and other barbarous nations; and the year following gained a con&s;iderable victory over them, and would, in all probability, have en|tirely &s;ubdued them in a very &s;hort time, had he not been taken with an illne&s;s, which carried him off on the 17th of March, 180, in the fifty-ninth year of his age, and nineteenth of his reign. The whole empire regretted the lo&s;s of &s;o valuable a prince, and paid the greate&s;t regard to his memory: he was ranked among&s;t the gods, and every per&s;on al|mo&s;t had a &s;tatue of him in their hou&s;es. His book of Meditations has been much admired by the be&s;t judges. It is wrote in Greek, and con|&s;i&s;ts of twelve books: there have been &s;everal editions of it in Greek and Latin. "Of all books (&s;ays the learned Meric Ca&s;aubon, in his preface to the &s;econd edition of his tran&s;lation of this work into Eng|li&s;h,) that have ever been written by any heathen, I know not any, which either in regard of it&s;elf (for the bulk thereof) or in regard of the author, de&s;erves more re&s;pect than this of Marcus Antoninus. The chiefe&s;t &s;ubject of the book is the vanity of the world, and all worldly things, as wealth and honour, life, &amp;c. and the end and &s;cope of it, to teach a man how to &s;ubmit him&s;elf wholly to God's providence, and to live content and thankful in what e&s;tate or calling &s;oever. In the au|thor of it, two main things I conceive very con&s;iderable; fir&s;t, that he was a very great man, one that had good experience of what he &s;pake: and &s;econdly, that he was a very good man; one that had lived as he did write, and exactly (as far as was po&s;&s;ible to a natural man) perform|ed what he exhorted others to. Be it therefore &s;poken to the immortal prai&s;e and commendation of Antoninus, that as he did write, &s;o he did live. Never did writings &s;o con&s;pire to give all po&s;&s;ible te&s;timony of goodne&s;s, uprightne&s;s, innocency, and whatever could, among&s;t heathens, be mo&s;t commendable, as they have done to commend this one: they commend him, not as the be&s;t prince only, but ab&s;olutely as the be&s;t man and be&s;t philo&s;opher that ever was. And it is his proper commen|dation, that being &s;o commended, he is commended without exception. If any thing had ever been talked again&s;t him, the hi&s;torians mention it but as a talk; not credited by them, nor by any that ever were of any credit. His Meditations were his actions: his deeds (if you con&s;ider him as a man and a heathen) did agree with his &s;entences."</P>

<HEAD>ANTONIO (NICHOLAS),</HEAD>
<P>KNIGHT of the order of St. James, and canon of Seville, did great honour to the Spani&s;h nation by his Bibliotheque of their writers. He was born at Seville, in 1617, being the &s;on of a gentleman, whom king Philip IV. made pre&s;ident of the admiralty e&s;tabli&s;hed in that city in 1626. After having gone through a cour&s;e of philo&s;ophy and divinity
<PB N="231" REF="249">
in his own country, he went to &s;tudy law at Salamanca, where he clo&s;ely attended the lectures of Franci&s;co Ramos del Manzano, afterwards coun|&s;ellor to the king, and preceptor to Charles II. Upon his return to Seville, after he had fini&s;hed his law-&s;tudies at Salamanca, he &s;hut him|&s;elf up in the royal mona&s;tery of Benedictines, where he employed him|&s;ell &s;everal years in writing his Bibliotheca Hi&s;panica, having the u&s;e of the books of Bennet de la Sana, abbot of that mona&s;tery, and dean of the faculty of divinity at Salamanca. In the year 1659, he was &s;ent to Rome by king Philip IV. in the character of agent-general from this prince: he had al&s;o particular commi&s;&s;ions from the inqui&s;ition of Spain, the viceroys of Naples and Sicily, and the governor of Milan, to nego|ciate their affairs at Rome. The cardinal of Arragon procured him from pope Alexander VII. a canonry in the church of Seville, the in|come whereof he employed in charity and purcha&s;ing of books: he had above thirty thou&s;and volumes in his library. By this help, joined to a continual labour and indefatigable application, he was at la&s;t enabled to fini&s;h his Bibliotheca Hi&s;panica, in four volumes, in folio, two of which he publi&s;hed at Rome, in the year 1672.

<P>A FAMOUS Roman orator. At his fir&s;t entrance into the &s;ervice of the commonwealth, he gave a remarkable proof of his &s;pirit and good &s;en&s;e, which de&s;erves to be mentioned: he had obtained the que&s;tor&s;hip of the province of A&s;ia, and had gone as far as Brundu|&s;ium to embark, in order to take upon him his office, when his friends &s;ent him word that he was accu&s;ed of ince&s;t, and that his cau&s;e was to
<PB N="232" REF="250">
be heard before Ca&s;&s;ius the pretor, a judge of &s;uch &s;everity, that his tribunal was &s;aid to be the rock of the accu&s;ed. Antonius might have taken the advantage of the law, which forbids any accu&s;ation to be ad|mitted again&s;t tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent on the public &s;ervice; but he cho&s;e rather to ju&s;tify him&s;elf in form, and for this purpo&s;e returned to Rome, where he &s;tood his trial, and was acquitted with great honour. Sicily fell to his lot during his pretor&s;hip, and he cleared the &s;eas of the pirates which infe&s;ted the coa&s;t. He was made con&s;ul with A. Po&s;thu|mius Albinus, in the year of Rome 653, when he oppo&s;ed the turbu|lent de&s;igns of Sextus Titus, tribune of the people, with great re&s;olution and &s;ucce&s;s. Some time after, he was made governor of Cilicia, in quality of procon&s;ul, where he performed &s;o many great exploits, that he obtained the honour of a triumph. We cannot omit ob&s;erving, that in order to improve his great talent for eloquence, he became a &s;cholar to the greate&s;t men at Rhodes and Athens, in his way to Cilicia, and when on his return to Rome. Soon after he was appointed cen&s;or, which office he di&s;charged with great reputation, having carried his cau&s;e before the people, again&s;t Marcus Duronius, who had preferred an accu&s;ation of bribery again&s;t him, in revenge for Antonius's having erazed his name out of the li&s;t of &s;enators, which this wi&s;e cen&s;or had done, becau&s;e Duronius, when tribune of the people, had abrogated a law, which re&s;trained immoderate expence in fea&s;ts. He was one of the greate&s;t orators ever known at Rome; and it was owing to him, accord|ing to the te&s;timony of Cicero, that Rome might boa&s;t her&s;elf a rival even to Greece it&s;elf in the art of eloquence. He defended, among&s;t many others, Marcus Aquilius, and moved the judges in &s;o &s;en&s;ible a manner, by the tears he &s;hed and the &s;cars he &s;hewed upon the brea&s;t of his client, that he carried his cau&s;e. Cicero has given us the character of his eloquence, and of his action. He never would publi&s;h any of his pleadings, that he might not, as he &s;aid, be proved to &s;ay in one cau&s;e, what might be contrary to what he &s;hould advance in another. He affected to be a man of no learning. His mode&s;ty, and many other qualifications, rendered him no le&s;s dear to many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, than his eloquence made him univer&s;ally admired. He was unfortu|nately killed, during the fatal di&s;turbances rai&s;ed by Marius and Cinna: it was di&s;covered where he had concealed him&s;elf, and &s;oldiers were immediately &s;ent to di&s;patch him. He &s;poke to them in &s;uch a manner that they were greatly affected, and there was none but the commander him&s;elf who had the cruelty to kill him, and he had not heard his di&s;|cour&s;e, but had ju&s;t entered into the room, full of indignation that his &s;oldiers had not executed his orders. This happened in the year of Rome 667.</P>

<HEAD>APELLES.</HEAD>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t celebrated painters of antiquity. He was born in the i&s;le of Cos, and flouri&s;hed in the time of Alexander the Great. He was in high favour with this prince, who made a law that no other per&s;on &s;hould draw his picture but Apelles: he accordingly drew him holding a thunderbolt in his hand; the piece was fini&s;hed with &s;o much &s;kill and dexterity, that it u&s;ed to be &s;aid there were two Alexanders, one invincible, the &s;on of Philip, the other inimitable, the production of Apelles. Alexander gave him likewi&s;e another remarkable proof of his regard, for when he employed Apelles do draw Campa&s;pe, one of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, having found that he had conceived an affection for her, he re&s;igned her to him; and it was from her that Apelles is &s;aid to have drawn his Venus Anadyomene. This prince went often to &s;ee Apelles when at work, and one day, when he was overlooking him, we are told that he talked &s;o ab&s;urdly in regard to painting, that Apelles de&s;ired him to hold his tongue, telling him, that the very boys who mixed the colours laughed at him. Mr. Frein&s;hemius, however, thinks it incre|dible that Apelles would make u&s;e of &s;uch an expre&s;&s;ion to Alexander; or that the latter, who had &s;o good an education, and &s;o fine a genius, would talk &s;o impertinently of painting: nor is it likely, perhaps, that Apelles would have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to this prince in the manner which he is reported to have done, upon another occa&s;ion. Alexander, as we are told, having &s;een his picture drawn by Apelles, did not com|mend it &s;o much as it de&s;erved; a little after, a hor&s;e happened to be brought, which neighed at &s;ight of the hor&s;e painted in the &s;ame picture: upon this Apelles is &s;aid to have told Alexander, "Sir, it is plain this hor&s;e under&s;tands painting better than your maje&s;ty."</P>
<P>One of Apelles's chief excellencies was his making his pictures ex|actly re&s;emble the per&s;ons repre&s;ented, in&s;omuch that the phy&s;iogno|mi&s;ts are &s;aid to have been able to form a judgment as readily from his portraits as if they had &s;een the originals. His readine&s;s and dexterity at taking a likene&s;s was of great &s;ervice to him, in extricating him from a difficulty in which he was involved at the court of Egypt: he had not the good fortune to be in favour with Ptolemy; a &s;torm forced him, however, to take &s;helter at Alexandria, during the reign of this prince: a mi&s;chievous fellow, in order to do him an injury, went to him, and in the king's name invited him to dinner. Apelles went, and &s;eeing the king in a prodigious pa&s;&s;ion, told him, by way of ex|cu&s;e, that he &s;hould not have come to his table but by his orders. He was commanded to &s;hew the man who had invited him; this was im|po&s;&s;ible, the per&s;on who had put the trick upon him not being pre&s;ent:

Apelles, however, drew a &s;ketch of his picture on the wall with a coal, the fir&s;t lines of which di&s;covered him immediately to Ptolemy.</P>
<P>Apelles left many excellent pictures, which are mentioned with great honour by the ancients; but his Venus Anadyomene is reckoned his ma&s;ter-piece. His Antigonus has al&s;o been much celebrated; this was drawn with a &s;ide-face to hide the deformity of Antigonus, who had lo&s;t an eye. His picture of Calumny has al&s;o been much taken notice of.</P>

<HEAD>APOLLONIUS RHODIUS,</HEAD>
<P>A GREEK writer, born in Alexandria, under the reign of Ptolemy Euergetes, king of Egypt. He was a &s;cholar of Callimachus, whom he is accu&s;ed of having treated with ingratitude, whereby he drew upon him&s;elf the indignation of this poet, who gave him the name of Ibis, from a bird of Egypt, which u&s;ed to purge it&s;elf with its bill. Apol|lonius wrote a poem upon the expedition of the Golden Fleece; the work is &s;tyled Argonautica, and con&s;i&s;ts of four books. Quintilian, in his In&s;titutiones Oratoriae, &s;ays that this performance is wrote "aequali quadam mediocritate:" that the author ob&s;erved an exact medium between the &s;ublime and low &s;tyle in writing. Longinus &s;ays al&s;o that Apollonius never &s;inks in his poem, but has kept it up in an uniform and equal manner: however, that he falls infinitely &s;hort of Homer, notwith&s;tanding the faults of the latter; becau&s;e the &s;ublime, though &s;ubject to irregularities, is always preferable to every other kind of writing. Gyraldus, &s;peaking of this poem, commends it as a work of great variety and labour; but &s;ays, however, that the &s;tyle and manner of it are har&s;h in &s;ome places, though quite otherwi&s;e where this poet de&s;cribes the pa&s;&s;ion of Medea. This he painted in &s;uch a manner, that Virgil him&s;elf was &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that he made no &s;cruple to copy it almo&s;t entirely in the &s;tory of Dido and Aeneas.</P>
<P>Apollonius not meeting at fir&s;t with that encouragement which he expected at Alexandria, removed to Rhodes, where he &s;et up a &s;chool for rhetoric, and gave lectures for a con&s;iderable time, thence he got the name of Rhodius. Here it was that he corrected and put the fi|ni&s;hing hand to his Argonautics, which being publicly recited, met with univer&s;al applau&s;e, and the author was complimented with the freedom of the city. He is &s;aid to have written a book concerning Archilochus, a treati&s;e of the Origin of Alexandria, Cnidos, and other works. He publi&s;hed his poem of the Argonautics at Alexandria, upon his return thither, when &s;ent for by Ptolemy Euergetes, to &s;uc|ceed Erato&s;thenes as keeper of the public library. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that

he died in this office, and that he was buried in the &s;ame tomb with his ma&s;ter Callimachus. The ancient &s;cholia upon his Argonautics are &s;till extant: they are thought to be written by Tarrhaeus, Theon, and others. Henry Stephens publi&s;hed an edition of this poem in Greek, in quarto, in 1574, with the Scholia and his own annotations.

Adrian; and he &s;peaks of the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem as of an event which happened in his time. He was born of a good family in Alex|andria, from whence he went to Rome, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf &s;o much at the bar, that he was cho&s;en one of the procurators of the emperor, and the government of a province was committed to him. He wrote the Roman hi&s;tory in a very peculiar method; he did not compile it in a continued &s;eries, after the manner of Livy, but wrote di&s;tinct hi&s;tories of all the nations that had been conquered by the Romans, and placed every thing relating to tho&s;e nations in their proper order of time.

<HEAD>ARABELLA STUART,</HEAD>
<P>COMMONLY called the Lady Arabella, &s;o often talked of for a Queen, that cu&s;tom &s;eems to have given her a right to an article in this manner under her Chri&s;tian name, as that by which our hi&s;torians di&s;|tingui&s;h her. She was the daughter of Charles Stuart, Earl of Lenox; who was younger brother to Henry Lord Darnley, father to King James VI. of Scotland, and I. of England; by Elizabeth, daughter of Sir William Cavendi&s;h, knt. She was born, as near as can be comput|ed, in the year 1577, and educated at London, under the eye of the old Counte&s;s of Lenox, her grand-mother. She was far from being eithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> beautiful in her per&s;on, or from being di&s;tingui&s;hed by any extraordinary qualities of mind, and yet &s;he met with many admirers, on account of her royal de&s;cent, and near relation to the crown of England. Her father dying in the year 1579, and leaving her there|by
<PB N="237" REF="255">
&s;ole heire&s;s, as &s;ome under&s;tood, of the hou&s;e of Lenox, &s;everal matches were thought of for her at home and abroad. Her cou&s;in, King James, inclined to have married her to Lord E&s;me Stuart, whom he had created Duke of Lenox, and whom before his marriage he con|&s;idered as his heir; but this match was prevented by Queen Elizabeth, though it was certainly a very fit one in all re&s;pects. As the Engli&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was at this time very problematical, the great powers on the Continent formed many de&s;igns about it, and thought of many hu&s;|bands for the Lady Arabella: &s;uch as the Duke of Savoy, a prince of the hou&s;e of Farne&s;e, and others. In the mean time, this lady had &s;ome thoughts of marrying her&s;elf at home, as a celebrated writer in|forms us, to a &s;on of the Earl of Northumberland's; but it is not cre|dible that this took effect, though he &s;ays it did privately. The very attempt procured her Queen Elizabeth's di&s;plea&s;ure, who confined her for it. In the mean time her title to the crown, &s;uch as it was, became the &s;ubject, among&s;t many others, of father Per&s;ons's famous book, wherein are all the arguments for and again&s;t her, and which &s;erved to divulge her name and de&s;cent all over Europe; and yet this book was not very favourable to her intere&s;t. On the death of the queen, &s;ome malecontents framed an odd de&s;ign of di&s;turbing the public peace, and among&s;t other branches of their dark &s;cheme, one was to &s;eize the Lady Arabella, and to cover their proceedings by the &s;anction of her title, intending al&s;o to have married her to &s;ome Engli&s;h nobleman, the more to increa&s;e their intere&s;t, and the better to plea&s;e the people. But this con&s;piracy was fatal to none but its authors, and tho&s;e who conver&s;ed with them; being &s;peedily defeated, many taken, and &s;ome executed. As for the Lady Arabella, is does not appear that &s;he had any knowledge of this engagement in her behalf, whatever it was; for dome&s;tic writers are perplexed, and foreign hi&s;torians run into ab|&s;urdities when they endeavour to explain it. She continued at liberty, and in &s;ome kind of favour at court, though her circum&s;tances were narrow, till the latter end of the year 1608, when &s;ome way or other &s;he drew upon her King James's di&s;plea&s;ure. However, at Chri&s;tmas, when there was much mirth and good humour at court, &s;he was again taken into favour, and had a &s;ervice of plate pre&s;ented to her of the value of two hundred pounds, a thou&s;and merks given her to pay her debts, and &s;ome addition made to her annual income. This &s;eems to have been done, in order to have gained her to the intere&s;t of the court, and to put the notions of marriage &s;he had entertained out of her head, all which however proved ineffectual; for in the beginning of the month of February, 1609, &s;he was detected in an intrigue with Mr. William Seymour, &s;on to Lord Beauchamp, and grand&s;on
<PB N="238" REF="256">
to the Earl of Hertford, to whom, notwith&s;tanding, &s;he was privately married &s;ome time afterwards. Upon this di&s;covery, they were both carried before the council, and &s;everely reprimanded, and then di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed. In the &s;ummer of the year 1610, the marriage broke out, whereupon the Lady was &s;ent into clo&s;e cu&s;tody, at the hou&s;e of Sir Thomas Parry, in Lambeth; and Mr. Seymour was committed to the Tower for his contempt, in marrying a lady of the royal family, with|out the king's leave. It does not appear that this confinement was at|tended with any great &s;everity to either; for the Lady was allowed the u&s;e of Sir Thomas Parry's hou&s;e and gardens, and the like gentle|ne&s;s, in regard to his high quality, was &s;hewn to Mr. Seymour. Some intercour&s;e they had by letters, was after a time di&s;covered, and a re&s;olution taken thereupon to &s;end the Lady to Durham; a re&s;olution which threw her into deep affliction. Upon this, by the interpo&s;ition of friends, &s;he and her hu&s;band concerted a &s;cheme for their e&s;cape, which was &s;ucce&s;sfully executed in the beginning, though it ended un|luckily. The Lady, under the care of Sir James Crofts, was at the hou&s;e of Mr. Conyers, at Highgate, from whence &s;he was to have gone the next day to Durham, on which &s;he put a fair countenance now, notwith&s;tanding the trouble &s;he had before &s;hewn. This made her keepers the more ea&s;y, and gave her an opportunity of di&s;gui&s;ing her|&s;elf, which &s;he did on Monday the 3d of June, 1611, by drawing over her petticoats a pair of large French-fa&s;hioned ho&s;e, putting on a man's doublet, a peruke which covered her hair, a hat, a black cloak, ru&s;&s;et boots with red tops, and a rapier by her &s;ide. Thus equipped, &s;he walked out between three and four with Mr. Markham. They went a mile and a half to a little inn, where a per&s;on attended with their hor&s;es. The Lady, by that time &s;he came thither, was &s;o weak and faint, that the ho&s;tler, who held the &s;tirrup when &s;he mounted, &s;aid, that gentle|man would hardly hold out to London. Riding, however, &s;o rai&s;ed her &s;pirits, that by the time &s;he came to Blackwall, &s;he was pretty well recovered. There they found waiting for them two men, a gentle|woman, and a chambermaid, with one boat full of Mr. Seymour's and her trunks, and another boat for their per&s;ons, in which they ha&s;ted from thence towards Woolwich. Being come &s;o far, they bade the watermen row on to Grave&s;end. There the poor fellows were de&s;ir|ous to land, but for a double freight were contented to go on to Lee yet being almo&s;t tired by the way, they were forced to lie &s;till at Til|bury, whil&s;t the rowers went on &s;hore to refre&s;h them&s;elves; then they proceeded to Lee, and by that time the day appeared, and they di&s;co|vered a &s;hip at anchor a mile beyond them, which was the French bark that waited for them. Here the Lady would have lain at ancho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="239" REF="257">
expecting Mr. Seymour, but through the importunity of her followers, they forthwith hoi&s;ted &s;ail and put to &s;ea. In the mean time Mr. Seymour, with a peruke and beard of black hair, and in a tawney cloth &s;uit, walked alone without &s;u&s;picion, from his lodging, out at the great we&s;t door of the Tower, following a cart that had brought him billets. From thence he walked along by the Tower-wharf, by the warders of the &s;outh gate, and &s;o to the iron gate, where one Rodney was ready with a pair of oars to receive him. When they came to Lee, they found that the French &s;hip was gone, the billows ri&s;ing high, they hired a fi&s;herman for twenty &s;hillings, to put them on board a certain &s;hip that they &s;aw under &s;ail. That &s;hip they found not to be it they look|ed for, &s;o they made forwards to the next under &s;ail, which was a &s;hip from Newca&s;tle. This, with much ado, they hired for forty pounds, to carry them to Calais, and the ma&s;ter performed his bargain, by which means Mr. Seymour e&s;caped, and continued in Flanders. On Tue&s;day in the afternoon, my Lord Trea&s;urer being adverti&s;ed that the Lady Arabella had made an e&s;cape, &s;ent immediately to the lieutenant of the Tower, to &s;et &s;trict guard over Mr. Seymour, which he promi&s;ed, after his <HI>yare</HI> manner <HI>he would thoroughly do, that he would</HI>; but coming to the pri&s;oner's lodgings, he found, to his great amazement, that he was gone from thence one whole day before. A pink being di&s;patched from the Downs into Calais road, &s;eized the French bark, and brought back the Lady and tho&s;e with her. As &s;oon as &s;he was brought to town, &s;he was, after examination, committed to the Tower, declaring that &s;he was not &s;o &s;orry for her own re&s;traint, as &s;he &s;hould be glad if Mr. Seymour e&s;caped, for who&s;e welfare, &s;he affirmed, &s;he was more concerned than for her own. Her aunt, the Counte&s;s of Shrew&s;bury, was likewi&s;e committed, on &s;u&s;picion of hav|ing prompted the Lady Arabella, not only to her e&s;cape, but to other things, it being known that &s;he had ama&s;&s;ed upwards of twenty thou|&s;and pounds in ready money. The Earl of Shrew&s;bury was confined to his hou&s;e, and the old Earl of Hertford &s;ent for from his &s;eat. By degrees things grew cooler, and though it was known that Mr. Sey|mour continued in the Netherlands, yet the court made no farther ap|plications to the Arch-Duke about him. In the beginning of the year 1612, a new &s;torm began to break out; for the Lady Arabella, either pre&s;&s;ed at an examination, or of her own free will, made &s;ome extra|ordinary di&s;coveries, upon which &s;ome quick &s;teps would have been taken, had it not &s;hortly after appeared, that her misfortunes had turn|ed her head, and that, con&s;equently, no u&s;e could be made of the evi|dence of a per&s;on out of her &s;en&s;es. However, the Counte&s;s of Shrew&s;|bury, who before had leave to attend her hu&s;band in his &s;ickne&s;s, was

very clo&s;ely &s;hut up, and the court was amu&s;ed with abundance of &s;trange &s;tories, which wore out by degrees, and the poor Lady Arabella langui&s;hed in her confinement till the 27th of September, 1615, when her life and &s;orrows ended together. Even in her grave this poor lady was not at peace, a report being &s;pread that &s;he was poi&s;oned, be|cau&s;e &s;he happened to die within two years of Sir Thomas Overbury. As for her hu&s;band, Sir William Seymour, he &s;oon after her decea&s;e procured leave to return, di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by loyally adhering to the king during the civil wars, and, &s;urviving to the time of the re&s;to|ration, was re&s;tored to his great-grandfather's title of Duke of Somer&s;et, by an act of parliament, which entirely cancelled his attainder; and on the giving his royal a&s;&s;ent to this act, King Charles II. was plea&s;ed to &s;ay in full parliament, what perhaps was as honourable for the family as the title to which they are re&s;tored. His words were the&s;e: <HI>As this is an act of an extraordinary nature, &s;o it is in favour of a per&s;on of no ordi|nary merit: he has de&s;erved of my father, and of my&s;elf, as much as any &s;ubject po&s;&s;ibly could do; and I hope this will &s;tir no man's envy, becau&s;e in doing it I do no more than what a good ma&s;ter &s;hould do for &s;uch a &s;ervant.</HI> By his Lady Arabella this noble per&s;on had no i&s;&s;ue; but that he &s;till pre&s;erved a warm affection for her memory, appears from hence, that he called one of his daughters by his &s;econd wife, Frances, daughter and co-heire&s;s of Robert Devereux, Earl of E&s;&s;ex, Arabella Seymour.</P>

<HEAD>ARCHILOCHUS,</HEAD>
<P>A GREEK poet, born in the i&s;le of Paros. He was the &s;on of Te|le&s;icles, and, according to Mr. Bayle, flouri&s;hed in the 29th Olympiad. His poetry abounded with the mo&s;t poignant &s;atire. His &s;atirical vein had &s;uch an effect on Lycambes, that he hanged him&s;elf on account of the &s;evere &s;atire which Archilochus wrote again&s;t him. The indigna|tion of Archilochus again&s;t Lycambes aro&s;e from the latter's not keep|ing his word: Lycambes had promi&s;ed him his daughter, and after|wards refu&s;ed her to him. It is not unlikely that he attacked the whole family of Lycambes in his lampoon, for it is &s;aid that the daughter fol|lowed the example of her father; and there are &s;ome who affirm, that three of Lycambes's daughters died of de&s;pair at the &s;ame time. In this piece of Archilochus, many adventures are mentioned, full of de|famation, and out of the knowledge of the public. There were like|wi&s;e many loo&s;e indelicate pa&s;&s;ages in the poem; and it is &s;aid to have been on account of this &s;atire, that the Lacedaemonians laid a prohi|bition on his ver&s;es; having con&s;idered the reading of &s;uch loo&s;e pieces as not agreeable to the rules of mode&s;ty. "The Lacedaemo|nians (&s;ays Valerius Maximus) commanded the book of Archilochus to
<PB N="241" REF="259">
be carried out of their city, becau&s;e they thought the reading of them not to be very mode&s;t or cha&s;te: for they were unwilling the minds of their children &s;hould be tinctured with them, le&s;t they &s;hould do more harm to their manners than &s;ervice to their genius. And &s;o they bani&s;hed the ver&s;es of the greate&s;t, or at lea&s;t next to the greate&s;t poet, becau&s;e he had attacked a family which he hated, with ob&s;cene abu&s;e." It has been affirmed by &s;ome, that he him&s;elf was bani&s;hed from Lacedaemon; and the maxim that he had in&s;erted in one of his pieces, is a&s;&s;igned for the rea&s;on thereof, "That it was better to fling down one's arms, than to lo&s;e one's life:" he had written this in vindication of him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Archilochus was &s;o much addicted to raillery and abu&s;e, he did not even &s;pare him&s;elf. He is &s;aid, however, to have been much in favour with Apollo; for when he had been killed in a combat, the oracle of Delphi drove the murderer out of the temple, and was not appea&s;ed without a multitude of excu&s;es and prayers; and even after this, the oracle ordered him to a certain hou&s;e, there to pacify the gho&s;t of Ar|chilochus. This poet excelled chiefly in iambic ver&s;es, and was the inventor of them. He is one of the three poets whom Ari&s;tarchus ap|proved in this kind of poetry. Quintilian puts him, in &s;ome re&s;pects, below the other two. Ari&s;tophanes the grammarian thought, that the longer his iambic poems were, the finer they were: Cicero informs us of this particular; "The longe&s;t of your epi&s;tles (&s;ay he to Atticus) &s;eems to me the be&s;t, as the iambics of Archilochus did to Ari&s;to|phanes." The hymn which he wrote to Hercules and Iolus, was &s;o much e&s;teemed, that it u&s;ed to be &s;ung three times to the honour of tho&s;e who had gained the victory at the Olympic games. There are few of his works extant; and this (&s;ays Mr. Bayle) is rather a gain than a lo&s;e, with regard to morality. Heraclides compo&s;ed a dialogue upon the life of this poet; which, if it had remained, would in all probability have furni&s;hed us with many pariculars concerning Archi|lochus.</P>

<HEAD>ARCHIMEDES,</HEAD>
<P>A CELEBRATED geometrician, born at Syracu&s;e, in the i&s;land of Sicily, and related to Hiero, king of Syracu&s;e. He was remarkable for his extraordinary application to mathematical &s;tudies, in which he u&s;ed to be &s;o much engaged, that his &s;ervants were often obliged to take him from thence by force. He had &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;ing invention in mechanics, that he affirmed to Hiero, if he had another earth where|on

to plant his machines, he could move this which we inhabit. He is &s;aid to have formed a gla&s;s &s;phere, of a mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing workman&s;hip, wherein the motions of the heavenly bodies were repre&s;ented. He fell upon a curious method to di&s;cover the deceit which had been practi&s;ed by a workman, employed by king Hiero to make a golden crown. But he became mo&s;t famous by his curious contrivances, whereby the city of Syracu&s;e was &s;o long defended, when be&s;ieged by Marcellus. "The vigorous efforts made to carry the place, had certainly &s;uc|ceeded &s;ooner (&s;ays Levy) had they not been fru&s;trated by one man: this was Archimedes, a man famous for his &s;kill in a&s;tronomy, but more &s;o for his &s;urpri&s;ing invention of war-like machines, with which in an in&s;tant he de&s;troyed what had co&s;t the enemy va&s;t labour to erect. Again&s;t the ve&s;&s;els, which came up clo&s;e to the walls, he contrived a kind of crow, projected above the wall, with an iron grapple fa&s;tened to a &s;trong chain; this was let down upon the prow of a &s;hip, and by means of the weight of a heavy counterpoi&s;e of lead, rai&s;ed up the the prow, and &s;et the ve&s;&s;el upright upon her poop; then letting it down all of a &s;udden, as if the ve&s;&s;el had fallen from the walls, to the great terror of the &s;eamen it &s;unk &s;o far into the &s;ea, that it let in a great deal of water, even when it fell directly on its keel." However, notwith&s;tanding all his art, Syracu&s;e was at length taken by Marcellus, who commanded his &s;oldiers to have a particular regard to the &s;afety of Archimedes; but this ingenious man was unfortunately &s;lain by a &s;ol|dier, who did not know him. "What gave Marcellus the greate&s;t con|cern (&s;ays Plutarch) was the unhappy fate of Archimedes, who was at that time in his mu&s;aeum, and his mind, as well as eyes, &s;o fixed and intent upon &s;ome geometrical figures, that he neither heard the noi&s;e and hurry of the Romans, nor perceived that the city was taken. In this tran&s;|port of &s;tudy and contemplation, a &s;oldier came &s;uddenly upon him, and commanded him to follow him to Marcellus; which he refu&s;ing to do till he had fini&s;hed his problem, and fitted it for demon&s;tration, the &s;oldier, in a rage, drew his &s;word, and ran him through. Others write that Archimedes &s;eeing a &s;oldier coming with a drawn &s;word to kill him, entreated him to hold his hand one moment, that he might not die with the regret of having left his problem unfini&s;hed, and the demon&s;tration imperfect; but that the &s;oldier, without any regard either to his problem or demon&s;tration, killed him immediately.

<HEAD>ARDEN (EDWARD)</HEAD>
<P>WAS de&s;cended of a mo&s;t ancient and honourable family, &s;eated at Parkhall, in Warwick&s;hire. He was born in the year 1532, and his father dying when he was an infant of two years old, he became, before he inherited the e&s;tate of the family, the ward of Sir George Throkmorton, of Coughton, who&s;e daughter Mary he afterwards married. In all probability, it was his engagement with this fa|mily, and being bred in it, that made him &s;o firm a papi&s;t as he was. However that be, &s;ucceeding his grandfather, Thomas Arden, E&s;q. in 1562, in the family e&s;tate, he married Mary (Throkmorton) and &s;ettled in the country, his religion impeding his preferment, and his temper inclining him to a retired life. His being a near neighbour to the great Earl of Leice&s;ter, occa&s;ioned his having &s;ome jars with him, who affected to rule all things in that county. Some per&s;ons therein, though of good families, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable e&s;tates, thought it no di&s;credit to wear that nobleman's livery, which Mr. Arden di&s;|dained. In the cour&s;e of this fatal quarrel, exce&s;&s;ive in&s;olence on one &s;ide, produced &s;ome warm expre&s;&s;ions on the other; in&s;omuch that Mr. Arden openly taxed the Earl with his conver&s;ing criminally with the Counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex, in that Earl's life time; and al&s;o inveighed again&s;t his pride as a thing the more inexcu&s;able in a nobleman newly created. The&s;e taunts having exa&s;perated that Mini&s;ter, he projected, or at lea&s;t forwarded, his de&s;truction. Mr. Arden had married one of his daugh|ters to John Somerville, E&s;q. a young gentleman of an old family, and good fortune, in the &s;ame county. This Mr. Somerville was a man of a hot ra&s;h temper, and by many thought a little crazy. He was drawn in a &s;trange manner to plot (if it may be &s;o called) again&s;t the Queen's life; and thus the trea&s;on is alledged to have been tran&s;acted. In the Whit&s;un-Holidays, 1583, he with his wife was at Mr. Arden's, where Hugh Hall, his father-in-law's Prie&s;t, per&s;uaded him that Queen Eli|zabeth
<PB N="244" REF="262">
being an incorrigible heretic, and growing daily from bad to wor&s;e, it would be doing God and his country good &s;ervice to take her life away. When the holidays were over, he returned to his own hou&s;e with his wife, where he grew melancholy, and irre&s;olute. Up|on this&punc; his wife writes to Hall, her father's Prie&s;t, to come and &s;trengthen the man. Hall excu&s;es his coming, but writes at large, to encourage Somerville to pro&s;ecute what he had undertaken. This letter had its effects; Somerville &s;et out for London, but got no farther than Warwick, where, drawing his &s;word and wounding &s;ome Prote&s;tants, he was in&s;tantly &s;eized. While he was going to Warwick, his wife went over to her father's, and &s;hewed him and her mother Hall's trea|&s;onable letter, which her father threw into the fire; &s;o that only the hear&s;ay of this letter could be alledged again&s;t him and his wife, by Hall who wrote it, who was tried and condemned with them. But to return to Somerville. On his apprehen&s;ion, he &s;aid &s;omewhat of his father and mother-in-law, and immediately orders were &s;ent into War|wick&s;hire for their being &s;eized and impri&s;oned. October 30, 1583, Mr. Somerville was committed to the Tower for high-trea&s;on. No|vember 4, Hall, the Prie&s;t, was committed al&s;o; and on the &s;eventh of the &s;ame month, Mr. Arden. On the &s;ixteenth, Mary the wife of Mr. Arden, Margaret their daughter, wife to Mr. Somerville, and Eli|zabeth, the &s;i&s;ter of Mr. Somerville, were committed. On the twenty-third Mr. Arden was racked in the Tower, and the next day Hugh Hall the Prie&s;t was tortured likewi&s;e. By the&s;e methods &s;ome kind of evidence being brought out, on the &s;ixteenth of December Edward Arden, E&s;q. and Mary his wife, John Somerville, E&s;q. and Hugh Hall the Prie&s;t, were tried and convicted of high-trea&s;on at Guildhall, London; chiefly on Hall's confe&s;&s;ion, who yet received &s;entence with the re&s;t. On the nineteenth of December, Mr. Arden and his &s;on-in-law, Somerville, were removed from the Tower to Newgate, for a night's time only: In this &s;pace Somerville was &s;trangled by his own hands, as it was given out; but, as the world believed, by &s;uch as de|&s;ired to get him &s;ilently out of theirs. The next day, being December 20, 1583, Edward Arden was executed at Smithfield with the general pity of all &s;pectators. He died with the &s;ame high &s;pirit he had &s;hewn throughout his life. After profe&s;&s;ing his innocence, he owned him&s;elf a Papi&s;t, and one who died for his religion, and want of flexibility, though under colour of con&s;piring again&s;t the State. He &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted, that Somerville was murdered, to prevent his &s;haming his pro|&s;ecutors, and having thus extenuated things to &s;uch as heard him, he patiently &s;ubmitted to an ignominious death. His execution was ac|cording to the rigour of the law, his head being &s;et (as Somerville's
<PB N="245" REF="263">
al&s;o was) upon London bridge, and his quarters upon the city gates; but the body of his &s;on-in-law was interred in Moorfields. As for Mrs. Arden, &s;he was pardoned, but the Queen gave the e&s;tate which fell to her, by her's and her hu&s;band's attainder, to Mr. Darcy. As for Hugh Hall, the Prie&s;t, he was pardoned too, but Leice&s;ter doubting his &s;e|crecy, would have engaged Chancellor Hatton to have &s;ent him abroad; which he refu&s;ing, new rumours, little to that proud Earl's honour, flew about. Hollin&s;hed, Stowe, and &s;uch writers, treat Mr. Arden as a traitor fairly convicted, and &s;o have others who knew much better; but Camden was too hone&s;t to write thus, and there is good au|thority to incline our belief, that he died for being a &s;tout Engli&s;hman, rather than a bad &s;ubject. His &s;on and heir Robert Arden, E&s;q. be|ing bred in one of the Inns of Court, proved a very wi&s;e and fortunate per&s;on, in&s;omuch that by various &s;uits he wrung from Edward Darcy, E&s;q. the grantee, mo&s;t of his father's e&s;tates, and by marrying Eliza|beth, daughter of Reginald Corbet, E&s;q. one of the Ju&s;tices of the King's Bench, he re&s;tored the credit and &s;plendor of this ancient family, and was &s;o happy to &s;ee Henry Arden, E&s;q. his elde&s;t &s;on, knighted by King James, and married to Dorothy, the daughter of Ba&s;il Fielding, of Newnham, E&s;q. who&s;e &s;on became Earl of Denbigh. The drawing this embarra&s;&s;ed account out of ob&s;curity, cannot but be grateful to our curious readers, and will an&s;wer one great end of this work, the elu|cidating dark pa&s;&s;ages in Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, by a compari&s;on of lights, a thing not to be expected in general collections, or even in the accounts of particular reigns.</P>

<HEAD>ARETIN (PETER)</HEAD>
<P>A NATIVE of Arezzo, who lived in the &s;ixteenth century. He was famous for his &s;atirical writings, and was &s;o bold as to carry his invectives even again&s;t &s;overeigns, and from thence got the title of the Scourge of Princes. Francis I. the emperor Charles V. mo&s;t of the princes of Italy, &s;everal cardinals, and many nob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emen courted his friend&s;hip by pre&s;ents, either becau&s;e they liked his compo&s;itions, or perhaps from an apprenen&s;ion of falling under the la&s;h of his &s;atire. Aretin became thereupon &s;o in&s;olent, that he is &s;aid to have got a me|dal &s;truck, on one &s;ide of which he is repre&s;ented with the&s;e words, IL DIVINO ARETINO; and on the rever&s;e, &s;itting upon a throne, re|ceiving the pre&s;ents of princes, with the&s;e words, I PRINCIPI TRIBU|TATI DA POPOLI, TRIBUTANO IL SERVIDOR LORO. Some im|agine he gave him&s;elf the title of Divine, &s;ignifying thereby that he performed the functions of a God upon earth by the thunderbolts with which he &s;truck the heads of the highe&s;t per&s;onages. He u&s;ed to boa&s;t,
<PB N="246" REF="264">
that his lampoons did more &s;ervice to the world than &s;ermons; and it was &s;aid of him, that he had &s;ubjected more princes by his pen, than the greate&s;t had ever done by their arms. Aretin wrote many irreligi|ous and ob&s;cene pieces; &s;uch are his dialogues, which were called Ra|gionamenti. We have al&s;o &s;ix volumes of Letters wrote by him, but they are not in much e&s;teem: "I have read (&s;ays Mr. Menage) all Peter Aretin's letters, without finding any thing that I could in&s;ert in any of my books; there is nothing but the &s;tyle of them worth regard|ing," Some &s;ay that Aretin changed his loo&s;e libertine principles; but however this may be, it is certain that he compo&s;ed &s;everal pieces of devotion: he wrote a Paraphra&s;e on the penitential P&s;alms, and another on Gene&s;is; he wrote al&s;o the Life of the Virgin Mary, and that of St. Catherine of Sienna, and of St. Thomas Aquinas. He was author likewi&s;e of &s;ome comedies, which were e&s;teemed pretty good of their kind. He died in the year 1556, being about &s;ixty-five years old.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid by &s;ome, that he fell into &s;uch a fit of laughter, on hearing &s;ome &s;mutty conver&s;ation, that he overturned the chair upon which he &s;at, and that in the fall he hurt his head and died upon the &s;pot. Aretin wrote &s;ome ver&s;es again&s;t Peter Strozzi, but he heartily repented of this&punc; for Strozzi, being a re&s;olute man, threatned to have him &s;tabbed in his bed; which &s;o frightened the poet, that he dur&s;t not allow any body to come into his hou&s;e, nor had he the courage to go out of it him&s;elf, as long as Strozzi &s;taid in the &s;tate of Venice.</P>

<HEAD>ARIOSTO (LODOVICO, OR LEWIS.</HEAD>
<P>A CELEBRATED Italian poet, de&s;cended of a good fumily, and born at the ca&s;tle of Reggio, in Lombardy, in the year 1474. He &s;oon gave marks of his great genius, for when very young, he compo&s;ed &s;everal excellent poetical pieces, one of the mo&s;t remarkable of which is the &s;tory of Pyramus and Thi&s;be, which he formed into a play, and had it acted by his brothers and &s;i&s;ters. This performance gained him great applau&s;e, all who &s;aw it pre&s;aging he would prove one of the greate&s;t poets of the age. His father, however, being a man of no ta&s;te for learning, regarded more what &s;tudy would be mo&s;t pro|fitable for his &s;on to follow, than what &s;uited his genius and inclination: he obliged him therefore to apply to the law, which he did for &s;ome years, though with great reluctance; but upon his father's death, he returned to the more agreeable pur&s;uits of poetry. He was left but in indifferent circum&s;tances, either becau&s;e the e&s;tate was divided among&s;t all his brothers, or becau&s;e his father's income con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of places of profit, which determined at his death. When Ario&s;to was
<PB N="247" REF="265">
about thirty years of age, he was introduced to Hippolito cardinal of E&s;t, a great patron of learned men, who entertained him in a very ho|nourable manner. The &s;ucce&s;s which he had hitherto had in the little poetical pieces which he had publi&s;hed, in&s;pired him with the ambition of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by &s;ome nobler work. Sannazarius, Bembo, Nangerius, and Sadolet, had rendered them&s;elves famous for the beauty of their Latin poems; Ario&s;to had likewi&s;e wrote &s;ome in this language, but finding, as &s;ir John Harrington ob&s;erves, that he could not rai&s;e him&s;elf to the highe&s;t rank among&s;t the Latin poets, which was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by others, he applied him&s;elf chiefly to the cultivation of his native tongue, being de&s;irous to enrich it with &s;uch works as would render it valuable and important to other nations. He read Homer and Virgil with critical a&s;&s;iduity, and having in view the&s;e great origi|nals, he began a poem on the loves of Orlando, taking the &s;ubject from Bojardo's Orlando Inamorato upon who&s;e model he proceeded. He began this poem when he was about thirty years of age; it is the mo&s;t celebrated of all his works, though there have been many different opinions concerning it. But his attachment to poetry did not hinder him from engaging in public affairs, for he was employed in emba&s;&s;ies and negociations in different parts of Italy. The cardinal of E&s;t wanted to have carried him to Hungary, with &s;ome other illu&s;trious per&s;ons who attended him, but Ario&s;to refu&s;ing to go, lo&s;t all his in|tere&s;t with his patron.</P>
<P>Upon the death of Hippolito he engaged in the &s;ervice of Alfon&s;o, duke of Ferrara, who treated him with great e&s;teem and affection, and appointed him governor of Graffignana, which office he di&s;charged with great honour and &s;ucce&s;s. After his return home, he dedicated the re&s;t of his life to retirement, pro&s;ecuting his &s;tudies in a hou&s;e which he built for him&s;elf at Ferrara. He tran&s;lated &s;everal pieces out of French and Spani&s;h into Italian; and wrote al&s;o &s;everal &s;atires, which, according to Mr. Menage, are e&s;teemed by the be&s;t judges. There are likewi&s;e five comedies of his extant, which the duke of Ferrara was &s;o plea&s;ed with, that he erected a magnificent &s;tage in the hall of Ferrara, for the repre&s;entation of them, and made the author &s;everal con&s;iderable pre&s;ents. At his de&s;ire, Ario&s;to tran&s;lated the Maenechmi of Plautus into Italian, which was exhibited with great &s;ucce&s;s; and all his other comedies were frequently acted by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t quality: and when his Lena was fir&s;t repre&s;ented, Ferdinand of E&s;t, afterwards marquis of Ma&s;&s;a, &s;o far honoured the piece, as to &s;peak the prologue. Ario&s;to u&s;ed to read his ver&s;es to his friends and the ladies of his acquaintance. His manner of reading was excellent; &s;o that he thereby gave a peculiar grace to every thing he pronounced.
<PB N="248" REF="266">
He was honoured with the laurel by the emperor Charles V. in the year 1533.</P>
<P>Ario&s;to was of an amorous di&s;po&s;ition, and left two natural &s;ons. He was affable, ea&s;y, and conde&s;cending in his temper. He enjoyed the friend&s;hip of the mo&s;t eminent men of learning of his time, mo&s;t of whom he mentions with great re&s;pect in the la&s;t canto of his Orlando Furio&s;o His con&s;titution was but weakly, &s;o that he was obliged to have recour&s;e to phy&s;icians the greate&s;t part of his life.

He was interred in the church of the Benedictine monks, who, contrary to their cu&s;tom, attended his funeral. He had a bu&s;t erected to him, and an epitaph, written by him&s;elf, in&s;cribed upon his tomb.

<HEAD>ARBUTHNOT (JOHN.)</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent phy&s;ician, a di&s;tingui&s;hed Wit, and a polite Writer, in the latter end of the &s;eventeenth, and the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, was de&s;cended from the noble family of his name in Scotland, and was the &s;on of a Clergyman of the Epi&s;copal Church in that country. He was born at Arbuthnot, in Kincardin&s;hire, near Mon|tro&s;e, not long after the Re&s;toration of King Charles the Second, but in what particular year is uncertain. Having been &s;ent, at a proper age, to the univer&s;ity of Aberdeen, he applied him&s;elf diligently to all the academical &s;tudies, and particularly to that of phy&s;ic, in which he took his Doctor's degree. The political principles of his father not &s;uffering him to comply with the Revolution, he forfeited his Church preferment, and retired for &s;upport to a &s;mall e&s;tate of his own. The &s;ons embraced the &s;ame political principles; on which account they were laid under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking their fortunes abroad. The Doctor, however, travelled no farther than to London, where he was entertained at the hou&s;e of Mr. William Pate, a Woollen-draper; &s;oon after which, he took up the bu&s;ine&s;s of teaching the mathematics, an undertaking for which he was very well qualified. He was probably engaged in this employment, when Dr. Woodward publi&s;hed, in 1695, his "E&s;&s;ay towards a natural Hi&s;tory of the Earth." The account
<PB N="249" REF="267">
which Dr. Woodward, in his E&s;&s;ay, gave of the univer&s;al deluge, appeared to Dr. Arbuthnot to be irreconcileable with ju&s;t philo&s;ophical rea&s;oning upon mathematical principles; and, therefore, he drew up an an&s;wer to that part of the work, under the following title: "An Examination of Dr. Woodward's Account of the Deluge, &amp;c. With a Compari&s;on between Steno's Philo&s;ophy and the Doctor's, in the Ca&s;e of Marine Bodies dug out of the Earth; by J.A. M.D. With a Letter to the Author, concerning <HI>An Ab&s;tract of Ago&s;tino Scilla's Book</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ubject; printed in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, by W. W. F. R. S." This learned piece appeared in 1697, in 8vo. and laid the foundation of Dr. Arbuthnot's literary reputation; which, not long after, received a con&s;iderable and de&s;erved increa&s;e by his "E&s;&s;ay on the U&s;efulne&s;s of Mathematical Learning:" In a Letter from a "Gentleman in the city to his Friend at Oxford." In the mean time, as phy&s;ic was his profe&s;&s;ion, &s;o the practice of it was what he principally had in view. At fir&s;t, indeed, as is u&s;ual with regard to young phy&s;icians, he met with no great encouragement; but, after a while, his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o increa&s;ed to produce a competency; and, by degrees, his &s;kill in it, joined with his plea&s;ing wit and exten&s;ive literature, in|troduced him into good e&s;teem and favour with the polite part of the world. On St Andrew's day, 1704, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society; and on the 30th of October, in the following year, he was &s;worn Phy&s;ician Extraordinary to Queen Anne, by her Maje&s;ty's e&s;pecial command. This honour was conferred upon him, in con|&s;ideration of his &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ervices to his Royal Highne&s;s Prince George of Denmark. That prince being taken &s;uddenly ill at Ep&s;om, was recommended to Dr. Arbuthnot, who happened to be upon the &s;pot; and his Highne&s;s recovering by the Doctor's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, ever af|ter employed him as his Phy&s;ician. Upon the indi&s;po&s;ition of Dr. Hannes, he was appointed, in November 1709, fourth Phy&s;ician in Ordinary to the Queen; and, on the 27th of April 1710, he was ad|mitted a Fellow of the College of Phy&s;icians. About this time, or a little after, Dr. Arbuthnot formed an intimate connection with the ce|lebrated triumvirate, Swift, Pope, and Gay; and it was not long be|fore he added a new lu&s;tre to that con&s;tellation of wits by the bright|ne&s;s of his own. Early in the year 1714, he engaged with Mr. Pope and Dr. Swift in a de&s;ign of writing a &s;atire on the abu&s;es of human learning in every branch; which was to be executed in the manner of Cervantes (the original author of this &s;pecies of &s;atire) under the hi&s;|tory of &s;ome feigned adventures. "They had ob&s;erved," &s;ays the in|genious and learned Editor of Mr. Pope's works, "tho&s;e abu&s;es &s;till kept their ground, again&s;t all that the grave&s;t and able&s;t authors
<PB N="250" REF="268">
could &s;ay to di&s;credit them: They concluded, therefore, the force of ridicule was wanting to quicken their di&s;grace; which was here in its place, when the abu&s;es had already been detected by &s;ober rea&s;oning; and <HI>truth</HI> in no danger to &s;uffer by the <HI>premature</HI> u&s;e of &s;o powerful an in&s;trument." But the pro&s;ecution of this noble de&s;ign, at lea&s;t in a re|gular way, was prevented by the Queen's death, which exceedingly di&s;concerted Pope, Swift, and Arbuthnot, who were all of them warmly attached to Lord Oxford's mini&s;try; and a final period was afterwards put to the project, by the &s;eparation and growing infirmities of Dr. Swift, by the bad health of Dr. Arbuthnot, and other concur|ring cau&s;es. The imperfect E&s;&s;ay which was drawn out towards this de&s;ign, under the title of the fir&s;t Book of the Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus, is &s;ufficient to make us greatly regret that it was not com|pleted. A critical account of this undertaking, and of the &s;hare which Dr. Arbuthnot had in it, we here pre&s;ent to the reader. "Polite letters," adds the celebrated Editor before mentioned, "never lo&s;t more, than in the defeat of this &s;cheme; in the execution of which, each of this illu&s;trious triumvirate would have found exerci&s;e for his own peculiar talents; be&s;ides con&s;tant employment for tho&s;e they all had in common. Dr. Arbuthnot was &s;killed in every thing which re|lated to <HI>Science:</HI> Mr. Pope was a ma&s;ter in the <HI>fine Arts</HI>; and Dr. Swift excelled in the <HI>Knowledge of the World.</HI> WIT they had all in equal mea&s;ure; and this &s;o large, that no age perhaps ever produced three men to whom Nature had more bountifully be&s;towd it, or Art had brought it to higher perfection." We are told by the &s;ame writer, that the travels of Guliver were fir&s;t intended as a part of Scriblerus's Memoirs. Queen Anne's death made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion upon Dr. Arbuthnot's &s;pirits, that, to divert his melancholy, he went to Paris, where a brother of his re&s;ided. His &s;tay there, however, was very &s;hort; for he returned to London in the beginning of September. Du|ring this time, he appears to have been in &s;ome &s;u&s;pence whether he &s;hould be permitted to hold his place at St. James's; but being at length told that he was to lo&s;e it, he philo&s;ophically ob&s;erved to Dr. Swift, that "he hoped to be able to keep a little habitation warm in town." Indeed, con&s;idering his attrchment to former men and mea&s;ures, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that he &s;hould be deprived of his &s;ituation in the royal hou&s;ehold; though it might have been to the honour of Govern|ment to have &s;hewn a peculiar indulgence to a man of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;h|ed genius and merit. Dr. Arbuthnot, having quitted St. James's, where he appears generally to have lived while he was phy&s;ician to Queen Anne, took a hou&s;e in Dover-Street. Some time after, in con|junction with Mr. Pope, he was engaged in giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Mr
<PB N="251" REF="269">
Gay in the Comedy, or rather the Farce, of <HI>Three Hours after Mar|riage.</HI> This play was brought upon the &s;tage in 1717, and was ill re|ceived, being damned on the fir&s;t night of its repre&s;entation. At the Bath &s;ea&s;on, in the latter end of 1722, Dr. Arbuthnot went to that city, apparently for his health, being accompanied by one of his bro|thers, who was lately come to England, and who&s;e &s;ingular and amiable character is well drawn by Mr. Pope, in a letter to Mr. Digby. On the 30th of September 1723, the Doctor was cho&s;en &s;econd Cen&s;or of the Royal College of Phy&s;icians. In 1725 he was &s;eized with a mo&s;t unu&s;ual and dangerous di&s;temper, an impo&s;thume in the bowels; from which he &s;peedily and happily recovered, to the great joy of his friends. He publi&s;hed, in 1727, in quarto, his work, intitled, <HI>Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights and Mea&s;ures, explained and exemplified, in &s;everal Di&s;&s;er|tations.</HI> In the &s;ame year, on the 5th of October, he was made an Elect of the College of Phy&s;icians: and, on the 18th of that month, he pronounced the Harveian Oration. During all this time, he con|tinued the practice of his profe&s;&s;ion with good reputation; and, among other eminent per&s;ons whom he attended in his medical capacity, was the late Earl of Che&s;terfield, who was proud to have &s;uch a man for his friend, as well as for his Phy&s;ician. Dr. Arbuthnot was not, how|ever, &s;o deeply engaged in bu&s;ine&s;s, but that he could find lei&s;ure to write &s;everal pieces of wit and humour, among which his Epitaph on the infamous Colonel Chartres, which came out in 1731, hath been particularly admired. Much about the &s;ame time, he wrote a very entertaining paper, concerning the <HI>Altercation</HI> or <HI>&s;colding of the Ancients.</HI> In 1732 he had an opportunity of contributing his endeavours to|wards detecting and puni&s;hing the &s;candalous frauds and abu&s;es which had been carried on, under the &s;pecious name of <HI>The Charitable Corpo|ration.</HI> In the &s;ame year, he publi&s;hed his treati&s;e concerning the "Nature and Choice of Aliments;" which was followed, in 1733, by his e&s;&s;ay on "The Effects of Air on human Bodies." A little be|fore the la&s;t publication, he met with a &s;evere dome&s;tic affliction, in the lo&s;s of his &s;on Charles, hereafter mentioned, "who&s;e life, he &s;ays, if it had &s;o plea&s;ed God, he would willingly have redeemed with his own." Neverthele&s;s, he added, with the greate&s;t piety, "I thank God for a new le&s;&s;on of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will, and likewi&s;e for what he hath left me." Dr. Arbuthnot is thought to have been led to the medical &s;ubjects ju&s;t mentioned, by the con&s;ideration of his own ca&s;e. His di&s;order was an a&s;thma, which, having gradually increa&s;ed with his years, became, at length, de&s;perate and incurable. Under this af|fliction, he retired, in 1734, with a view of obtaining &s;ome &s;mall re|lief, to Hamp&s;tead; from whence, in an&s;wer to a kind enquiry of Mr. Pope, he gave that friend a particular account of his di&s;temper, and of
<PB N="252" REF="270">
his having no expectations of a recovery. In a letter, written two or three months after, to his other great friend, Dr. Swift, he di&s;plays the re&s;ignation, calmne&s;s, and piety of his mind. Though he met with a temporary relief at Hamp&s;tead, and e&s;pecially from riding, yet, being &s;en&s;ible that an effectual cure of his di&s;ea&s;e was impo&s;&s;ible, he thought proper to return to his own hou&s;e in Cork-Street, Burlington-Gardens, where he departed this life, on the 27th of February 1734-5.</P>
<P>Dr. Arbuthnot appears, in every re&s;pect, to have been a mo&s;t amiable and worthy man; and the ju&s;tne&s;s of the following account of him, which comes from the ingenious pen of Lord Orrery, will be acknow|ledged by all who are acquainted with the Doctor's life and writings. His Lord&s;hip, &s;peaking of that part of Swift's epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence which only was then publi&s;hed, adds, "I &s;hould have been much plea&s;ed in finding &s;ome of Dr. Arbuthnot's letters among this collection. Although he was ju&s;tly celebrated for wit and learning, there was an excellence in his character more amiable than all his other qualifica|tions: I mean the excellence of his heart. He has &s;hewn him&s;elf equal to any of his contemporaries in humour and vivacity; and he was &s;u|perior to mo&s;t men in acts of humanity and benevolence. His very &s;ar|ca&s;ms are the &s;atyrical &s;trokes of good nature: They are like &s;laps in the face given in je&s;t, the effects of which may rai&s;e blu&s;hes, but no blackne&s;s will appear after the blows. He laughs as jovially as an at|tendant upon Bacchus, but continues as &s;ober and con&s;iderate as a di&s;|ciple of Socrates. He is &s;eldom &s;erious, except in his attacks upon vice; and then his &s;pirit ri&s;es with a manly &s;trength, and a noble indig|nation. His epitaph upon Chartres (allowing one &s;mall alteration, the word <HI>permitted,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>connived at</HI>) is a complete and a ma&s;terly compo&s;ition in its kind. No man exceeded him in the moral duties of life: a merit &s;till more to his honour, as the ambitious powers of wit and genius are &s;eldom &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive enough to confine them&s;elves within the limitations of morality. In his letter to Mr. Pope, written, as it were, upon his death-bed, he di&s;covers &s;uch a noble fortitude of mind at the approach of his di&s;&s;olution, as could be in&s;pired only by a clear con&s;cience, and the calm retro&s;pect of an uninterrupted &s;eries of virtue. The DEAN laments the lo&s;s of him with a pathetic &s;incerity. <HI>The deaths of</HI> Mr. Gay, <HI>and the</HI> Doctor, &s;ays he to Mr. Pope, <HI>have been ter|rible wounds near my heart. Their living would have been a great comfort to me, although I &s;hould never have &s;een them: like a &s;um of money in a bank, from which I &s;hould receive at lea&s;t annual intere&s;t, as I do from you, and have done from Bolingbroke.</HI>" This te&s;timony of Lord Orrery's, to the merit of Dr. Arbuthnot, is confirmed by that of Mr. Pope, who u&s;ed to repre&s;ent his morals as equal to any man's, and his wit and hu|mour
<PB N="253" REF="271">
as &s;uperior to tho&s;e of all mankind. So prolific was his wit, that in this quality Swift only held the &s;econd place. No adventure of any con&s;equence ever occurred, on which the Doctor did not write a plea&s;ant e&s;&s;ay, in a great folio book, which u&s;ed to lie in his parlour. Of the&s;e, however, he was &s;o negligent, that while he was writing them at one end, he &s;uffered his children to tear them out at the other, for their paper-kites. We learn, from Mr. George Arburthnot, that his father &s;eldom related any thing of him&s;elf or his writings; which he neglected &s;o much when fini&s;hed, that he was &s;ometimes at a lo&s;s to find them. The integrity of his character is well expre&s;&s;ed in a letter to Dr. Swift: "I have not &s;een any thing as yet, to make me recant a certain inconvenient opinion I have, that one cannot pay too dear for peace of mind." Dr Arbuthnot always made it a point to &s;tand up for the honour of religion. We are told, that he was often with Lord Che&s;terfield in the morning, and more than once declared him&s;elf, in his Lord&s;hip's pre&s;ence, a patron of Chri&s;tianity. But the Doctor's zeal and &s;teadine&s;s in this re&s;pect will be&s;t appear in one of his own letters. "My neighbour, the Pro&s;eman, is wi&s;er, and more cowardly and de&s;pairing than ever. He talks me into a fit of vapours twice or thrice a week. I dream at night of a chain, and rowing in the gal|lies. But, thank God, he has not taken from me the freedom I have been accu&s;tomed to in my di&s;cour&s;e (even with the greate&s;t per&s;ons to whom I have acce&s;s), in defending the cau&s;e of Liberty, Virtue, and Religion. For the la&s;t, I have the &s;atisfaction of &s;uffering &s;ome &s;hare of the ignominy that belonged to the fir&s;t confe&s;&s;ors. This has been my lot, from a &s;teady re&s;olution I have taken of giving the&s;e ignorant impudent fellows battle upon all occa&s;ions." There is nothing which more di&s;tingui&s;hes Dr. Arbuthnot's character, than the cheerfulne&s;s of his temper. In a letter wretten to Dr. Swift, in 1723, he &s;ays, "As for your humble &s;ervant, <HI>with a great &s;tone in his right kidney,</HI> and a fa|mily of men and women to provide for, he is as cheerful as ever in public affairs." It was not to public affairs only that this di&s;po&s;ition was confined: for it evidently appears to have accompanied him in every &s;ituation, and every affliction of life; a circum&s;tance which we the rather take notice of, as a reflection to the di&s;advantage of it hath been thrown out by a late writer. Upon the whole, we may conclude, after the mo&s;t impartial &s;urvey of Dr. Arbuthnot's character, that his memory is intitled to di&s;tingui&s;hed honour, as a man of wit, a man of &s;cience and literature, and a man of religion and virtue. In &s;aying this, we do not mean to a&s;&s;ert, that we entirely approve, in every in|&s;tance, of his choice of the objects again&s;t which his humour and &s;atire were directed. In &s;ome of his political principles we greatly differ from
<PB N="254" REF="272">
him; and we think that ca&s;es might be mentioned, in which his ridi|cule was too &s;everely pointed at men of real abilities and merit. The Doctor is &s;aid, but at what particular period we are not informed, to have been &s;ome time Steward to the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. He was a married man, and, be&s;ides other children, had two &s;ons, George and Charles; the latter of whom was educated at Chri&s;t Church College, Oxford, and entered int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> holy orders. Two daughters &s;urvived him, who are &s;ince dead, unmarried. George, who is &s;till living,, is fir&s;t Secondary in the Remembrance-Office, a place of very con&s;iderable profit. He is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an ample fortune be&s;ides, and is a gentleman of known and acknowledged worth and character. Dr. Arbuthnot &s;hared the &s;ame fate with his friends Pope and Swift, in having &s;everal literary brats illegitimately fathered up|on him; and among the re&s;t, the famous Romance of <HI>Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe.</HI> There came out, in 1751, in two volumes 12 <HI>mo. The Mi&s;cellaneous Works of the late Dr. Arbuthnot</HI>; to which is prefixed the following adverti&s;e|ment: "The contents of the&s;e volumes, and what is in&s;erted in Swift's Mi&s;cellanies, comprehend all the pieces of wit and humour of this admirable author." Although this collection, which hath gone through various editions, undoubtedly contains &s;ome of his genuine productions; yet every reader of ta&s;te and di&s;cernment will ea&s;ily per|ceive, that many, if not mo&s;t of the tracts here a&s;cribed to him, can|not have proceeded from his excellent pen: and George Arbuthnot, E&s;q. upon the peru&s;al of them, hath te&s;tified, that the greate&s;t part of them were not written by his father.</P>

<HEAD>ARISTOPHANES,</HEAD>
<P>A CELEBRATED comic poet of Athens. His place of nativity, however, has been conte&s;ted, for his enemies endeavoured to repre&s;ent him as a &s;tranger: but he fully confuted this &s;ugge&s;tion, repeating on this occa&s;ion a ver&s;e of Telemachus in the Ody&s;&s;ey, thus tran&s;lated:
<Q><L>My mother told me &s;o: 'twas he, &s;he &s;aid;</L>
<L>I know not: and, pray, who has more to plead?</L></Q></P>
<P>He was contemporary with Plato, Socrates, and Euripides, and mo&s;t of his plays were written during the Peloponne&s;ian war. His imagina|tion was warm and lively, and his genius particularly turned to raillery: he had al&s;o great &s;pirit and re&s;olution, and was a declared enemy to &s;lavery, and to all tho&s;e who wanted to oppre&s;s their country. The Athenians &s;uffered them&s;elves in his time to be governed by men, who had no other views than to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the common|wealth.
<PB N="255" REF="273">
Ari&s;tophanes expo&s;ed the de&s;igns of the&s;e men, with great wit and &s;everity, upon the &s;tage. Cleon was the fir&s;t whom he attacked; in his comedy of the Equites; and as there was not one of the come|dians who would venture to per&s;onate a man of his great authority, Ari&s;tophanes played the character him&s;elf, and with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that the Athenians obliged Cleon to pay a fine of five talents, which were given to the poet. He de&s;cribed the affairs of the Athenians in &s;o exact a manner, that his comedies are a faithful hi&s;tory of that people. For this rea&s;on, when Diony&s;ius king of Syracu&s;e de&s;ired to learn the &s;tate and language of Athens, Plato &s;ent him the comedies of Ari&s;tophanes, telling him the&s;e were the be&s;t repre&s;entation thereof. He wrote above fifty comedies, but there are only eleven extant which are perfect; the&s;e are Plutus, the Clouds, the Frogs, Equites, the Acharnen&s;es, the Wa&s;ps, Peace, the Birds, the Eccle&s;iazu&s;ae or Female Orators, the The&s;mopho&s;iazu&s;ae or Prie&s;te&s;&s;es of Ceres, and Ly&s;i&s;trata. The Clouds, which he wrote in ridicule to Socrates, is the mo&s;t cele|brated of all his comedies: Madam Dacier tells us, &s;he was &s;o much charmed with this performance, that after &s;he had tran&s;lated it, and read it over two hundred times, it did not become the lea&s;t tedious to her, which &s;he could not &s;ay of any other piece; and that the plea|&s;ure which &s;he received from it, was &s;o exqui&s;ite, that &s;he forgot all the contempt and indignation which Ari&s;tophanes de&s;erved for employ|ing his wit to ruin a man, who was wi&s;dom it&s;elf, and the greate&s;t or|nament of the city of Athens. Ari&s;tophanes having conceived &s;ome aver&s;ion to the poet Euripides, &s;atirizes him in &s;everal of his plays, particularly in his Frogs and his The&s;mopho&s;iazu&s;ae. He wrote his Peace in the tenth year of the Peloponne&s;ian war, when a treaty for fifty years was concluded between the Athenians and the Lacedemo|nians, though it continued but &s;even years. The Acharnen&s;es was writ|ten after the death of Pericles, and the lo&s;s of the battle in Sicily, in order to di&s;&s;uade the people from intru&s;ting the &s;afety of the common|wealth to &s;uch imprudent generals as Lamachus. Soon after, he re|pre&s;ented his Aves, or Birds, by which he admoni&s;hed the Athenians to fortify Decelaea, which he calls by a fictitious name Nepheloccoccy|gia. The Ve&s;pae or Wa&s;ps, was written after another lo&s;s in Sicily, which the Athenians &s;uffered from the mi&s;conduct of Chares. He wrote the Ly&s;i&s;trata when all Greece was involved in a war; in which comedy the women are introduced debating upon the affairs of the commonwealth, when they came to a re&s;olution, not to go to bed with their hu&s;bands till a peace &s;hould be concluded. His Plutus, and other comedies of that kind, were written after the magi&s;trates had given orders, that no per&s;on &s;hould be expo&s;ed by name upon the
<PB N="256" REF="274">
&s;tage. He invented a peculiar kind of ver&s;e, which was called by his name, and is mentioned by Cicero in his Brutus; and Suidas &s;ays, that he al&s;o was the inventor of the tetrameter and octometer ver&s;e.</P>
<P>Ari&s;tophanes was greatly admired among&s;t the ancients, e&s;pecially for the true attic elegance of his &s;tyle: "It is (&s;ays Madam Dacier) as agreeable as his wit; for be&s;ides its purity, force, and &s;weetne&s;s, it has a certain harmony, which &s;ounds extremely plea&s;ant to the ear: when he has occa&s;ion to u&s;e the common ordinary &s;tyle, he does it with|out u&s;ing any expre&s;&s;ion that is ba&s;e and vulgar; and when he has a mind to expre&s;s him&s;elf loftily, in his highe&s;t flight he is never ob|&s;cure." "Let no man (&s;ays Scaliger) pretend to under&s;tand the attic dialect, who has not Ari&s;tophanes at his fingers ends; in him are to be found all the attic ornaments, which made St. Chry&s;o&s;tom &s;o much admire him, that he always laid him under his pillow when he went to bed." Mr. Frichlin ob&s;erves, that Plautus has a great affinity to Ari|&s;tophanes in his manner of writing, and has imitated him in many parts of his plays. Frichlin has written a vindication of our poet, in an|&s;wer to the objections urged again&s;t him by Plutarch. How great an opinion Plato had of Ari&s;tophanes is evident even from Plutarch's ac|knowledgment, who tells us, that this poet's Di&s;cour&s;e upon Love was in&s;erted by that philo&s;opher in his Sympo&s;ium: and Cicero, in his fir&s;t book, De Legibus, &s;tyles him "the mo&s;t witty poet of the old comedy." There have been &s;everal editions and tran&s;lations of this poet. The time of his death is unknown; but it is certain he was living after the expul&s;ion of the tyrants by Thra&s;ybulus, whom he mentions in his Plu|tus and other comedies.</P>

<HEAD>ARISTOTLE,</HEAD>
<P>THE chief of the peripatetic philo&s;ophers, born at Stagyra, a &s;mall city in Macedon, in the 99th Olympiad, about three hundred and eighty-four years before the birth of Chri&s;t. He was the &s;on of Nicho|machus, phy&s;ician to Amyntas, the grandfather of Alexander the Great. He lo&s;t his parents in his infancy; and Proxenes, a friend of his father's, who had the care of his education, taking but little no|tice of him, he quitted his &s;tudies, and gave him&s;elf up to the follies of youth. After he had &s;pent mo&s;t of his patrimony, he entered into the army; but not &s;ucceeding in this profe&s;&s;ion, he went to Delphos, to con&s;ult the oracle what cour&s;e of life he &s;hould follow; when he was advi&s;ed to go to Athens, and &s;tudy philo&s;ophy. He accordingly went thither when about eighteen years of age, and &s;tudied under Plato till he was thirty-&s;even. By this time he had &s;pent his whole fortune; and we are told that he got his living by &s;elling powders, and &s;ome receipts in
<PB N="257" REF="275">
pharmacy. He followed his &s;tudies with mo&s;t extraordinary dilligence, &s;o that he &s;oon &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all in Plato's &s;chool. He eat little, &s;lept le&s;s; and that he might not over-&s;leep him&s;elf, Diogenes Laertius tells us, that he lay always with one hand out of the bed, having a ball of bra&s;s in it, which, by its falling into a ba&s;on of the &s;ame metal, awaked him. We are told, that Ari&s;totle had &s;everal conferences with a learn-Jew at Athens, and that by this means he in&s;tructed him&s;elf in the &s;ci|ences and religion of the Aegyptians, and that he thereby &s;aved him&s;elf the trouble of travelling into Egypt. When he had &s;tudied about fif|teen years under Plato, he began to form different tenets from tho&s;e of his ma&s;ter, who became highly piqued at his behaviour. Upon the death of Plato, he quitted Athens, and retired to Atarnya, a little city of My&s;ia, where his old friend Hermias reigned. Here he married Pythias, the &s;i&s;ter of this prince, whom he is &s;aid to have loved &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately, that he offered &s;acrifice to her. Some time after, Hermias having been taken pri&s;oner by Meranon, the king of Per&s;ia's general, Ari&s;totle went to Mitylene, the capital of Le&s;bos, where he remained till Philip, king of Macedon, having heard of his great re|putation, &s;ent for him to be tutor to his &s;on Alexander, then about fourteen years of age, Ari&s;totle accepted the offer, and in eight years taught him rhetoric and natural philo&s;ophy, which, according to Plutarch, he taught nobody el&s;e. Philip erected &s;tatues in honour of Ari&s;totle, and for his &s;ake rebuilt Stagyra, which had been almo&s;t ruined by the wars.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle having lo&s;t the favour of Alexander by adhering to Ca|li&s;thenes, his kin&s;man, who was accu&s;ed of a con&s;piracy again&s;t Alex|ander's life, he removed to Athens, where he &s;et up his new &s;chool. The magi&s;trates received him very kindly, and gave him the Lycaeum, &s;o famous afterwards for the concour&s;e of his di&s;ciples: and here it was, according to &s;ome authors, that he compo&s;ed his principal works. Plutarch, however, tells us, that he had already wrote his books of Phy&s;ics, Morals, Metaphy&s;ics and Rhetoric. The &s;ame author &s;ays, that Ari&s;totle being piqued at Alexander, becau&s;e of the pre&s;ents he had &s;ent to Xenocrates, was moved with &s;o much re&s;entment, that he entered into Antipater's con&s;piracy again&s;t this prince. The advocates for Ari&s;totle, however, maintain this charge to have been without foundation; that at lea&s;t it made no impre&s;&s;ion on Alexander, &s;ince about the &s;ame time he ordered him to apply him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of animals; and &s;ent him, in order to defray his expences, eight hun|dred talents, which amounts to four hundred and eighty thou&s;and crowns, be&s;ides a great number of fi&s;hers and hunt&s;men to bring him all &s;orts of animals. When Ari&s;totle was accu&s;ed of impiety by one Eu|rymedon,
<PB N="258" REF="276">
a prie&s;t of Ceres, he wrote a large apology for him&s;elf, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the magi&s;trates: but knowing the Athenians to be extremely jealous in regard to their religion, and remembering the fate of Socrates, he was &s;o much alarmed, that he retired to Chalcis, a city of Eubaea, where he ended his days. Some &s;ay he poi&s;oned him&s;elf, to avoid fal|ling into the hands of his enemies: others affirm, that he threw him|&s;elf into the Euripus, becau&s;e he could not comprehend the rea&s;on of its ebbing and flowing; and there are &s;ome who tell us he died of a cholic, in the &s;ixty-third year of his age, being the third of the 114th Olimpiad, two years after Alexander. The Stagyrites carried away his body, and erected altars to his memory.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides his treati&s;es on philo&s;ophy, he wrote al&s;o on poetry, rhetoric, law, &amp;c. to the number of four hundred treati&s;es, according to Dioge|nes Laertius; or more, according to Francis Patricius of Venice. An account of &s;uch as are extant, and of tho&s;e &s;aid to be lo&s;t, may be &s;een in Fabricius's Bibliotheca Graeca. He left his writings with Theo|phra&s;tus, his beloved di&s;ciple, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the Lycaeum, and forbad that they &s;hould ever be publi&s;hed. Theophra&s;tus, at his death, tru&s;ted them to Neleus, his good friend and di&s;ciple, who&s;e heirs buried them in the ground at Scep&s;is, a town of Troas, to &s;ecure them from the king of Pergamus, who made great &s;earch every where for books to adorn his library. Here they lay concealed one hun|dred and &s;ixty years, until, being almo&s;t &s;poiled, they were &s;old to one Apellicon, a rich citizen of Athens. Sylla found them at this man's hou&s;e, and ordered them to be carried to Rome. They were &s;ome time after purcha&s;ed by Tyrannion a grammarian; and Andronicus of Rhodes having bought them of his heirs, was in a manner the fir&s;t re&s;torer of the works of this great philo&s;opher; for he not only repaired what had been decayed by time and ill keeping, but al&s;o put them in a better order, and got them copied. There were many who followed the doctrine of Ari&s;totle in the reigns of the twelve Cae&s;ars, and their numbers increa&s;ed much under Adrian and Antoni|nus: Alexander Aphrodinus was the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;or of the Peripatetic philo&s;ophy at Rome, being appointed by the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus; and in &s;ucceeding ages the doctrine of Ari&s;totle prevailed almo&s;t among&s;t all men of letters, and many commentaries were wrote upon his works.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Doctors of the church di&s;approved of the doctrine of Ari|&s;totle, as allowing too much to rea&s;on and &s;en&s;e; but Anatolius, bi&s;hop of Laodicea, Didymus of Alexandria, St. Jerom, and St. Augu&s;tin, and &s;everal others, at length wrote and &s;poke in favour of it. In the &s;ixth age, Boethius made him known in the we&s;t, and tran&s;lated &s;ome of his pieces into Latin. But from the time of Boethus to the eighth
<PB N="259" REF="277">
age, Joannes Dama&s;cenus was the only man who made an abridgment of his philo&s;ophy, or wrote any thing concerning him. The Grecians, who took great pains to re&s;tore learning in the eleventh and following ages, applied much to the works of this philo&s;opher, and many learned men wrote commentaries on his writings: among&s;t the&s;e were Alfarabius, Algazel, Avicenna, and Averroes. They taught his doctrine in Africa, and afterwards at Cordoya in Spain. The Spaniards introduced his doctrine into France, with the commentaries of Averroes and Avicenna; and it was taught in the univer&s;ity of Paris, until Amauri, having &s;upport|ed &s;ome particular tenets on the principles of this philo&s;opher, was condemned of here&s;y, in a council held there in 1210, when all the works of Ari&s;totle that could be found were burnt, and the reading them forbidden under pain of excommunication. This prohibition was confirmed, as to the Phy&s;ics and Metaphy&s;ics, in 1215, by the Pope's legate; though at the &s;ame t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me he gave leave for his Logic to be read, in&s;tead of St. Augu&s;tin's, u&s;ed at that time in the univer&s;ity. In the year 1265, Simon, cardinal of St. Cecil, and legate from the holy &s;ee, prohibited the reading of the Phy&s;ics and Metaphy&s;ics of Ari&s;totle. All the&s;e prohibitions, however, were taken off in 1366; for the cardinals of St. Mark and St. Martin, who were deputed by pope Urban V. to reform the univer&s;ity of Paris, permitted the read|ing of tho&s;e books, which had been prohibited: and in the year 1448, pope Stephen approved of all his works, and took care to have a new tran&s;lation of them into Latin.</P>

<HEAD>ARIUS,</HEAD>
<P>A DIVINE of the fourth century, the head and founder of the Arians, a &s;ect which denied the eternal divinity and con&s;ub&s;tantiality of the Word. He was born in Lybia, near Egypt. Eu&s;ebius, bi&s;hop of Nicomedia, a great favourite of Con&s;tantia, &s;i&s;ter of the emperor Con&s;tantine, and wife of Licinius, became a zealous promoter of Ari|ani&s;m. He took Arius under his protection, and introduced him to Con&s;tantia; &s;o that the &s;ect increa&s;ed, and &s;everal bi&s;hops embraced it openly. There aro&s;e, however, &s;uch di&s;putes in the cities, that the emperor, in order to remedy the&s;e di&s;orders, was obliged to a&s;&s;emble the council of Nice, where, in the year 325, the doctrine of Arius was condemned. Arius was bani&s;hed by the emperor, and all his books were ordered to be burnt, and capital puni&s;hment was denounced again&s;t whoever dared to keep them. After five years bani&s;hment, he was recalled to Con&s;tantinople, where he pre&s;ented to the emperor &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion of faith as made him believe Arius quite orthodox. In the year 331, Arius went to Alexandria, where St. Athana&s;ius refu&s;ed to receive him, notwith&s;tanding all his menaces and recommendatory let|ters.
<PB N="260" REF="278">
He came to this city again in 335; but though Athana&s;ius had been &s;ent into exile, yet the people of Alexandria rejected Arius, who began to rai&s;e di&s;turbances in Egypt. Con&s;tantine being informed thereof, &s;ent orders to him to come to Con&s;tantinople, where his friends intended that he &s;hould be received into the communion of that city. Con&s;tantine demanded of Arius, if he followed the Nicene faith? Arius a&s;&s;ured him he did, by an oath; and the emperor having de|manded a profe&s;&s;ion of his faith, he pre&s;ented it to him in writing; but he had clothed his favourite tenets in the &s;implicity of Scrip|ture expre&s;&s;ions, and he took oath of his belief in the contents of the paper which he delivered. Con&s;tantine, being per&s;uaded of the &s;in|cerity of Arius, ordered Alexandria to admit him again into the church. Arius was now conducted in triumph by Eu&s;ebius and his other adhe|rents; but as they approached the great &s;quare of Con&s;tantinople, Arius being pre&s;&s;ed by a natural nece&s;&s;ity, retired to a hou&s;e of con|venience, where he died in&s;tantly on the &s;pot, all his entrails bur&s;ting out with his liver and &s;pleen. This happened in the year 336. Arius's &s;ect however did not die with him, for it was &s;upported by &s;everal bi&s;hops, and &s;everal others of great weight in the church. The Arians, by turns, per&s;ecuted, and were per&s;ecuted. There are &s;everal authors who find fault with Arius, for putting his &s;entiments into ver&s;e, that they might be &s;ung by his di&s;ciples; and they particularly cen&s;ure the matter and form of his Thalia.</P>

<HEAD>ARMINIUS (JAMES,)</HEAD>
<P>THE founder of the &s;ect of Armenians, or Remon&s;trants, born at Oude-water, in Holland, in 1560. He lo&s;t his father in his infancy, and was indebted for the fir&s;t part of his education to a good-natured clergyman, who had imbibed &s;ome of the opinions of the reformed, and who, in order to avoid being obliged to &s;ay ma&s;s, often changed his habitation. Arminius was a &s;tudent at Utrecht when death de|prived him of his patron; this lo&s;s would have embarra&s;&s;ed him greatly, but that he had the good fortune to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Rodolphus Snellius, his countryman, who took him with him to Marpurg in 1575. Soon after his arrival here, he had the news of his country having been &s;acked by the Spaniards: this plunged him into the mo&s;t dreadful af|fliction, nor could he help returning to Holland, to be him&s;elf an eye|witne&s;s of the &s;tate to which things were reduced; but having found that his mother, his &s;i&s;ters, his brethren, and almo&s;t all the inhabitants of Oude-water had been murdered, he returned to Marpurg: his &s;tay here was, however, but &s;hort, for he returned again to Holland, being
<PB N="261" REF="279">
informed of the foundation of the univer&s;ity of Leyden, and pur&s;ued his &s;tudies at this new academy with &s;o much a&s;&s;iduity and &s;ucce&s;s, that he acquired very great reputation. He was &s;ent to Geneva, in 1583, at the expence of the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, to perfect his &s;tudies: and here he applied him&s;elf chiefly to the lectures of Theodore Beza, who was at this time explaining the Epi&s;tle to the Romans. Arminius had the misfortune to di&s;plea&s;e &s;ome of the leading men of the univer|&s;ity, becau&s;e he maintained the philo&s;ophy of Ramus in public with great warmth, and taught it in private: being obliged therefore to re|tire, he went to Ba&s;il, where he was received with great kindne&s;s. Here he acquired &s;uch great reputation, that the faculty of divinity offered him the degree of doctor without any expence; but he mode&s;tly excu&s;ed him&s;elf from receiving this honour, and returned to Geneva; where having found the adver&s;aries of Rami&s;m le&s;s violent than for|merly, he became al&s;o more moderate. He had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee Italy, and particularly to hear the philo&s;ophical lectures of the famous James Zabarella, at Padua. He &s;atisfied this cario&s;ity, and &s;pent &s;ix or &s;even months in the journey: he then returned to Geneva, and af|terwards to Am&s;terdam, where he found many calumnies had been rai&s;ed again&s;t him, on account of his journey to Italy, which had &s;ome|what cooled the affections of the magi&s;trates of Am&s;terdam, his friends and patrons. He ea&s;ily ju&s;tified him&s;elf to men of &s;en&s;e, though many weak and &s;uper&s;titious per&s;ons remained prejudiced again&s;t him. He was ordained mini&s;ter at Am&s;terdam, the 11th of Augu&s;t, 1588, and &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his &s;ermons, which were remarkable for their &s;olidity and learning: &s;o that he was extremely followed, and univer&s;ally applauded. Martin Lydius, profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Fra|neker, thought him a fit per&s;on to refute a writing, wherein the doctrine of Theodore Beza upon prede&s;tination, had been attacked by &s;ome mini&s;ters of Delft: Arminius accordingly, at his earne&s;t entreaty, undertook to refute this work; but upon examining and weighing the arguments on both &s;ides, he embraced the opinions he propo&s;ed to con|fute; and even went farther than the mini&s;ters of Delft. He was threatened with &s;ome trouble about this at Am&s;terdam, being accu&s;ed of departing from the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrine; but the magi&s;trates of Am|&s;terdam interpo&s;ing their authority, prevented any di&s;&s;en&s;ion. In 1603, he was called to the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip of divinity at Leyden: he began his lectures with three elegant orations; the fir&s;t, Of the object of divinity; the &s;econd, Of the author and End of it; and the third, Of the Cer|tainty of it: and then proceeded to the expo&s;ition of the prophet Jonah. The di&s;putes upon grace &s;oon after kindled in the univer&s;ity, and the &s;tates of the province were forced to appoint conferences betwixt him
<PB N="262" REF="280">
and his adver&s;aries. Gomarus was a great per&s;ecutor of Arminius; but the reputation of the latter was &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, that he was con|tinually attended by a numerous audience, who admired the &s;trength of argument and &s;olid learning which he &s;hewed in all his lectures: this expo&s;ed him to the envy of his brethren, who treated him with great outrage. In the year 1607, he wrote an excellent letter to the em|ba&s;&s;ador of the elector palatine, to vindicate his conduct with regard to the conte&s;ts about religion, in which he was engaged: and the &s;ame year gave a full account to the States of Holland, of his &s;entiments with regard to the controverted points. The&s;e conte&s;ts, however, his continual labour, and his unea&s;ine&s;s at &s;eeing his reputation bla&s;ted by a number of &s;landers, threw him into a fit of &s;ickne&s;s, of which he died the 19th of October, 1609. Dominic Baudius and Hugo Grotius wrote each of them a poem upon his death; and Daniel Hein&s;ius did the &s;ame: but this poem was afterwards &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in the addition of his works.</P>
<P>Arminius was e&s;teemed an excellent preacher; his voice was low, but very agreeable; and his pronunciation admirable: he was ea&s;y and affable to per&s;ons of all ranks, and facetious in his conver&s;ation among&s;t his friends. His great de&s;ire was, that Chri&s;tians would bear with one another in all controver&s;ies, which did not affect the funda|mentals of their religion; and when they per&s;ecuted each other for points of indifference, it gave him the utmo&s;t di&s;&s;atisfaction. His enemies endeavoured to repre&s;ent him in the mo&s;t di&s;advantageous light, but his memory has been &s;ufficiently vindicated by men of the greate&s;t di&s;tinction. He left &s;everal works</P>

<P>(JOSEPH CAESAR) a famous painter, born in the year 1560, at the ca&s;tle of Arpinas, in the kingdom of Naples. He lived in great intimacy with pope Clement VIII. who conferred upon him the honour of knighthood, and be&s;towed on him many other marks of his friend&s;hip. In the year 1600, he went to Paris with cardinal Aldobrandin, who was &s;ent legate to the French court, on the marriage of Henry IV. with Mary of Medicis. His Chri&s;tian maje&s;ty gave Arpinas many con|&s;iderable pre&s;ents, and created him a knight of St. Michael. The colouring of this painter is thought to be cold and inanimate; yet there is &s;pirit in his de&s;igns, and his compo&s;itions have &s;omewhat of fire and elevation. The touches of his pencil being free and bold, are there|fore admired by connoi&s;&s;eurs in painting; but they are generally in|correct. What he painted of the Roman hi&s;tory is the mo&s;t e&s;teemed of all his works. The French king has in his collection the following

<HEAD>ARRIAN,</HEAD>
<P>A FAMOUS hi&s;torian and philo&s;opher, who lived under the em|peror Hadrian and the two Antoninu&s;es, born at Nicomedia in Bithynia. He was &s;tyled the &s;econd Xenophon, and was rai&s;ed to the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable dignities of Rome. Mr. Tillemont takes him to be the &s;ame per&s;on with that Flaccus Arrianus, who, being governor of Cappadocia, &s;topped the incur&s;ions of the Alani, and &s;ent an account of his voyage round the Euxine &s;ee to Hadrian. He is &s;aid to have been preceptor to the famous philo&s;opher and emperor Marcus Antoninus. There are extant four books of his Diatribae, or Di&s;&s;ertations upon Epictetus, who&s;e di&s;ciple he had been; and Photius tells us that he compo&s;ed like|wi&s;e twelve books of that philo&s;opher's di&s;cour&s;es. We are told by another author, that he wrote the Life and Death of Epictetus. The mo&s;t celebrated of his works in his Hi&s;tory, in Greek, of Alexander the Great, in &s;even books: a performance much e&s;teemed by the be&s;t judges. Photius mentions al&s;o his hi&s;tory of Bithynia, another of the Alani, and a third of the Parthians in &s;eventeen books, which he brought down to the war carried on by Trajan again&s;t them. He gives us likewi&s;e an abridgment of Arrian's ten books of the Hi&s;tory of the Succe&s;&s;ors of Alexander the Great: and tells us al&s;o, that he wrote an account of the Indies in one book, which is &s;till extant. The work which he fir&s;t entered upon was the Hi&s;tory of Bithynia, but wanting the proper memoirs and materials for it, he &s;u&s;pended the execution of this de&s;ign till he had publi&s;hed &s;ome other performances. This hi&s;tory con&s;i&s;ted of eight books, and was carried down till the time when Ni|comedes re&s;igned Bithynia to the Romans: but there is nothing of it remaining but what is quoted in Photius and Stephanus Byzantinus. Arrian is &s;aid to have written &s;everal other works: Lucian tells us, that he wrote the life of a robber, who&s;e name was Tiliborus: this author, endeavouring to excu&s;e him&s;elf for the pains he had taken in writing the Life of Alexander the Impo&s;tor, &s;peaks in the following manner: "Let no per&s;on (&s;ays he) accu&s;e me of having employed my labour up|on too low and mean a &s;ubject, &s;ince Arrian, the worthy di&s;ciple of Epictetus, who is one of the greate&s;t men among&s;t the Romans, and who has pa&s;&s;ed his whole life among&s;t the Mu&s;es, conde&s;cended to write the Life of Tiliborus." There is likewi&s;e, under the name of Arrian, a Periplus of the Red-&s;ea, that is, of the ea&s;tern coa&s;ts of Af|rica and A&s;ia, as far as the Indies; but authors are not agreed whether this is the production of the author of whom we write. There is like|wi&s;e
<PB N="264" REF="282">
a book of Tactics under his name, the beginning of which is lo&s;t; to the&s;e is added the order which he gave for the marching of the Ro|man army again&s;t the Alani, and giving them battle, which may very properly be a&s;cribed to our author, who was engaged in a war again&s;t that people.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal other per&s;ons of his name: Julius Capitolinus, in his Life of the Emperor Gordian, mentions a Greek hi&s;torian of that name: this cannot be the Arrian of whom we write, &s;ince he lived an age before that emperor. Suetonius, in his Life of Tiberius, mentions a poet of the &s;ame name; but he was more ancient than the other two, &s;ince Tiberius endeavoured to imitate him in his Greek poems: he is very probably the &s;ame, who, according to Suidas, wrote the Alexan|drias, an heroic poem in twenty-four book, upon the actions of Alex|ander the Great.</P>

<HEAD>ARSENIUS,</HEAD>
<P>A DEACON of the Roman church, of great learning and piety. He was pitched upon by the pope to go to the emperor Theodo&s;ius, as tutor to his &s;on Arcadius. Ar&s;enius arrived at Con&s;tantinople in the year 383. The emperor happening one day to go into the room where Ar&s;enius was in&s;tructing Arcadius, he found his &s;on &s;eated and the pre|ceptor &s;tanding; he reproached the latter for not &s;upporting properly the dignity of his employment: Ar&s;enius politely excu&s;ed him&s;elf, al|ledging that having the honour to &s;peak to an emperor (for Arcadius had been a&s;&s;ociated to the empire at eight years of age) he could not, with good manners, remain &s;eated in his pre&s;ence. But Theodo&s;ius not being &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, took from his &s;on the imperial or|naments, made Ar&s;enius fit in his place, and ordered Arcadius for the future to receive his le&s;&s;ons &s;tanding and uncovered. Arcadius, how|ever, profited but little by his tutor's in&s;tructions; for &s;ome time after he formed a de&s;ign of di&s;patching Ar&s;enius.

He accordingly went for Candia, at the time when this city was be&s;ieged by the Turks: he gave there &s;o many proofs of his bravery, that he ob|tained the honour of knighthood in the military order of St. George. When he was upon his return for Italy, he was often obliged to draw his &s;word: he was &s;ometimes wounded in the&s;e rencounters, but be|ing an excellent &s;word&s;man, he had often the advantage of his anta|goni&s;t. He rendered him&s;elf &s;o formidable even in Germany, that they u&s;ed to &s;tyle him Chevalier de Sang. Erne&s;t, duke of Burn&s;wic and Lunenburg, appointed him captain of his guards; but this did not make him neglect the Mu&s;es, for he cultivated them amid&s;t the noi&s;e of arms. He was member of &s;everal academies in Italy, and became highly in favour with many princes, e&s;pecially the emperor Leopold. He died the 11th of February, 1679, at Naples, where he was inter|red in the church of the Dominicans with great magnificence: the academy De gl' Intricati attended his funeral, and Vincent Antonio Capoci made his funeral oration.</P>

<P>FAMOUS for his Treati&s;e upon Dreams.

the glory of the Britons, procured him quickly a competent army, with which he routed Colgrin and all his forces, con&s;i&s;ting of Saxons, Scots, and Picts, on the banks of the river Douglas, but not without very con&s;iderable lo&s;s on his own &s;ide. Upon this, Colgrin retired with the remains of his army into York, where Arthur be&s;ieged him, and while he lay before the place, Cador Duke of Cornwall defeated Baldulph the brother of Colgrin, who with &s;ix thou&s;and men came to his relief. The King however could not take York; for Cheldric, or Cerdic, King of the Saxons, landing in Albania, <HI>i.e.</HI> Scotland, with a prodigious number of men, from on board a fleet of &s;ix hundred &s;ail, marched towards the Britons; upon which, by the advice of his council, Arthur rai&s;ed the &s;iege of York, and marched to Lon|don. On his arrival in that city, he called a general a&s;&s;embly, wherein the &s;tate of affairs having been thoroughly debated, it was agreed to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Hoel King of Armorica, <HI>i. e.</HI> Britanny, who was Arthur's &s;i&s;ter's &s;on, to intreat his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; which being accordingly done, Hoel him&s;elf embarked with fifteen thou&s;and men, and landing at Southampton, then called the Port of Hamo, quickly found his uncle, who received him with all the affection and re&s;pect imaginable. Immediately after this junction, Arthur and his kin&s;|man marched to oblige the Saxons to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Kaerlind coit, now called Lincoln. The Saxons, upon their approach, in&s;tantly ro&s;e from before the place, that with the greater conveniency they might fight the Britons. The battle was bloody and ob&s;tinate; but at la&s;t the Saxons were overthrown with the lo&s;s of &s;ix thou&s;and men, part killed, and part drowned in the rivers. The remains of the army retired to the woods of Caledon, which mo&s;t probably are Celi|don woods in Lincoln&s;hire, where they made a brave &s;tand; but being &s;urrounded by the Britons, were at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender up|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> articles, <HI>viz.</HI> That they &s;hould leave behind them all their booty, retire peaceably to their &s;hips, and tran&s;port them&s;elves back again into Germany. For the performance of the&s;e articles they gave ho&s;tages, and were then &s;uffered to retire in order to embark quietly. But in their voyage repenting of what they had done, they landed at Totne&s;s, burnt all the country as far as the Severn &s;ea, &s;laughtered the pea&s;ants, ruined the villages, and at length laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge to the city of Badon, <HI>i.e.</HI> Bath in Somer&s;et&s;hire. When this news was brought to King Arthur, who was on the point of marching again&s;t the Scots and Picts, he in&s;tantly ordered the Saxon ho&s;tages to be put to death, and then marched to the relief of the be&s;ieged city. When he drew near it, him&s;elf fir&s;t made a &s;peech to the army,
<PB N="268" REF="288">
and then the Archbi&s;hop Dubricius harangued them likewi&s;e, and gave them his ble&s;&s;ing. On the day of battle, Arthur put on an ex|cellent coat of mail, a golden helmet, with the figure of a dragon upon the top thereof: acro&s;s his &s;houlder hung his &s;hield, called Pridwen or Prywen, wherein was pictured the Virgin Mary, bearing the child Je&s;us in her arms: he had likewi&s;e by his &s;ide his &s;word called Calliburn, and in his right hand he bore his lance Rou. Thus equipped, he attacked the Saxons, who were drawn up in the form of a wedge. The battle la&s;ted from morning till evening, when the Saxons withdrew to the top of a high hill, and there encamped. The next day Arthur attacked them again; but they made a gallant defence, till the greate&s;t part of the day was worn out, which &s;o en|raged Arthur, that he threw him&s;elf among the foremo&s;t ranks, and, with great hazard of his per&s;on, performed there incredible feats of valour, for he &s;lew with his own hand four hundred and &s;eventy men. The Britons, encouraged by the example of their prince, forced the Saxon camp on all hands, and put many thou&s;ands of them to the &s;word, among&s;t whom fell Colgrin and Baldulph. But as for Cerdic he carried off the remains of his army, and endeavoured to recover his &s;hips. After the important victory at Badon, Arthur received advice, that the Scots and Picts had be&s;ieged the city of Aclud, which is thought to be Dunbritton in Scotland, where he left his nephew Hoel &s;ick, at the time he marched back again&s;t the Saxons. To his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, therefore, the generous Briti&s;h Prince marched with all the alacrity imaginable, leaving Cador Duke of Cornwall to pur&s;ue the Saxons. On his approach, the Scots and Picts not only rai&s;ed the &s;iege, but fled precipitately to Lough-Lomond, where they endeavoured to fortify them&s;elves in the i&s;lands; but Arthur having quickly equipped a fleet, obliged them to &s;urrender, and out of his great clemency pardoned them. In the mean time Cador, Duke of Cornwall, taking a circuit round the Saxons, and thereby giving them time to collect them&s;elves into a body, and to refre&s;h after their fatigues, &s;uddenly &s;eized and carried away their &s;hips, and then marched in que&s;t of them, who, perceiving their de&s;perate con|dition, retired into the i&s;le of Thanet, where Cador blocked them up with their own &s;hips, and after killing their commander Cerdic in fight, forced them to &s;urrender upon articles, and to give ho&s;tages once more for their departing out of the kingdom. This done, Cador rejoined the king, who kept his Chri&s;tmas at York, where he de&s;troyed the temples of the Pagans, re&s;tored the Chri&s;tian churches and appointed Pyramus, his chaplain, Archbi&s;hop of this See.
<PB N="269" REF="289">
He al&s;o promoted Augu&s;el to the &s;overeignty over the Scots, reward|ed other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, and took him&s;elf to wife Guanhu|mara, a lady de&s;cended from the Romans, of exqui&s;ite beauty, bred up in the family of Cador Duke of Cornwall. The next &s;ummer he fitted out a fleet, and therewith invaded Ireland, of which Guilla|murius was the chief King, who, to oppo&s;e him, drew together a numerous army, which Arthur defeated, and made him pri&s;oner: upon this all the petty princes in the i&s;land &s;ubmitted. Then he &s;ail|ed to Iceland, which he likewi&s;e &s;ubdued, and received the &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions of Doldavius King of Gothland, and Gun&s;a&s;ius King of the Orkneys, whom the very terror of his arms had reduced to obedi|ence. After this he returned into Britain, and governed here twelve years in peace, with &s;uch magnificence and &s;plendor, that all Europe was amazed at it, and the greate&s;t potentates &s;tood in fear of him. At length Sichelin, King of the Norwegians dying, and leaving his kingdom to Lot, Arthur's brother-in-law, the people of Norway, notwith&s;tanding, &s;et up Riculf. On this pretence, therefore, Arthur invaded that kingdom, defeated the Norwegians, killed Riculf, conquered Norway and Dacia, that is, Denmark, and having given the whole to Lot, proceeded with his victorious army to invade Gaul, then a province, as our hi&s;torian tells us, of the Roman empire. The greate&s;t part of the country he quickly &s;ubdued, blocked up the Roman governor in Paris, and reduced him to &s;uch &s;traits there, that he was on the very point of &s;tarving. In this di&s;tre&s;s he chal|lenged Arthur to a &s;ingle combat, which he was too gallant a man to refu&s;e; whereupon a bloody duel en&s;ued, in which at fir&s;t Arthur had the wor&s;t, but at length he conquered and killed Flollo, upon which Paris &s;urrendered. He &s;pent, however, nine years in conquering the re&s;t of France, after which he returned to that city, and kept a royal court, be&s;towing Neu&s;tria, afterwards called Normandy, upon his butler, Bedver, and the re&s;t of the provinces upon his dome&s;tics. Upon the approach of the fea&s;t of Penteco&s;t, Arthur determined to to call a great a&s;&s;embly of the mo&s;t noble of his &s;ubjects, which he appointed to be held at Caerleon in Montgomery&s;hire; becau&s;e &s;tanding on the river U&s;k, near the Severn &s;ea, it was both plea&s;ant and commodious for the coming and going of tho&s;e who were invit|ed. Accordingly there a&s;&s;embled Augu&s;el, King of Scotland, the King of North-Wales, the King of South-Wales, Cador, now called King of Cornwall, the Archbi&s;hops of London, York, and Caer|leon, with a multitude of Briti&s;h Princes; there came likewi&s;e Guilla|murius King of Ireland, Malva&s;ius King of Iceland, Doldavius King
<PB N="270" REF="290">
of Gothland, Gunfa&s;ius King of the Orkneys, Lot King of Norway A&s;chillius King of the Dacians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At this time he was &s;olemnly crowned, the Kings of Scotland, Cornwall, North and South-Wales, carrying four golden &s;words before him. Not long after this, the Romans demanded tribute, which Arthur, by the advice of his council, not only refu&s;ed, but re&s;olved to make war upon them. A mighty army he gathered, and marched to Southampton where he embarked, leaving the government of Britain to his nephew Modred, the &s;on of Lot, by his &s;i&s;ter Anne, before mentioned. But while he was a coa&s;ting about the i&s;land, he had news brought him, that a Spani&s;h giant had forcibly taken away Helena, the daughter of his nephew Hoel, Duke of Britanny, whom he had carried to mount St. Michael in Cornwall. Thither the King pur&s;uing him, &s;lew him in &s;ingle combat, after which he proceeded in the war he had fir&s;t de&s;igned, and having therein triumphed over all the forces of the Roman empire, and &s;lain with his own hand Lucius Tiberius, their General, as he was pa&s;&s;ing the Alps in order to go to Rome, he receiv|ed advice, that Modred his nephew had revolted, and had married Guanhumara his Queen. This, &s;ays our hi&s;torian, obliged him to de&s;i&s;t from his enterprize again&s;t Leo, King of the Romans: where|fore, &s;ending Hoel, King of Britanny, with a great army to &s;ecure the peace of Gaul, he, with the re&s;t of his forces, &s;ailed for Britain. Modred, knowing the badne&s;s of his cau&s;e, endeavoured to fortify him&s;elf by many and great alliances. With this view he once more called in the Saxons, and al&s;o invited, by promi&s;ing great &s;ums of money, the Scots, Picts, and Iri&s;h, to fight under his banner. At length, having a&s;&s;embled eighty thou&s;and men, he led them down into Kent, to oppo&s;e his uncle, who he knew intended to land there. He could not however prevent Arthur's coming on &s;hore; but he pre|&s;ently engaged him, and after a bloody battle, in which many of the King's friends fell, was defeated and forced to fly to Winche&s;ter. As for the Queen, &s;he retired to the city of Caerleon, and there be|came a Nun. King Arthur pur&s;ued his nephew to Winche&s;ter, and there a &s;econd time engaged him, beat him, and forced him to fly towards Cornwall. There, on the banks of the river Camel, Mo|dred made a &s;tand again with &s;ixty thou&s;and men, with whom Ar|thur fought a third battle, wherein, after thou&s;ands had been &s;lain, and, among&s;t them, many of the mo&s;t honourable per&s;ons on both &s;ides, at length, Modred him&s;elf was killed, and his army totally routed. In this engagement, however, our hero Arthur received &s;everal wounds, which forced him to retire into the i&s;land of Avalon,
<PB N="271" REF="291">
where, feeling him&s;elf extremly weak, he re&s;igned the crown to Con&s;tantine, the &s;on of Cador Duke of Cornwall, and a few days after died, A. D. 542. It is nece&s;&s;ary to add a little &s;ober truth to this romantic &s;tory, and therefore let us conclude this article with ob&s;erving, that Henry II. who was the fir&s;t of the Plantagenet line, being, in the la&s;t year of his reign, at Pembroke, and hearing there a Wel&s;h bard &s;inging to his harp the &s;tory of our Arthur, conclud|ing with an account of his death and burial, in the church-yard of Gla&s;tenbury, between two pyramids, the King in&s;tantly gave orders that the matter &s;hould be enquired into, and the body dug up. This was done as the King directed, and at the depth of &s;even feet, was found a va&s;t &s;tone, whereon was fa&s;tened a leaden cro&s;s, with this in|&s;cription on the in&s;ide: Hic Jacet Sepultus Inclytus Rex Arturius in In&s;ula Avalonia; <HI>Here lieth the famous King Arthur, buried in the I&s;le of Avalon.</HI> Digging &s;till lower, they found the King's body in the trunk of a tree, his beautiful Queen lying by him, with long flowing hair, in colour bright as gold, which however &s;unk into du&s;t when touched. The King's bones were very large &s;ized, and in his &s;kull there were ten wounds or more all cicatrized, except that of which he died. This di&s;covery was made in the year 1189, as Gi|raldus Cambren&s;is tells us, who &s;aw the&s;e bones, and examined the whole matter carefully. There was al&s;o a table containing this &s;tory, &s;et up in the mona&s;tery of Gla&s;tenbury, and the leaden cro&s;s, with the in&s;cription, remained there till the di&s;&s;olution of the mona&s;tery, where it was &s;een by the great antiquary, Leland; but what is become of it &s;ince, does not appear.</P>

<HEAD>ARUNDEL (THOMAS),</HEAD>
<P>ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury, in the reigns of Richard II. Henry IV. and Henry V. He was the &s;econd &s;on of Robert earl of Arundel and Warren, and brother of Richard Earl of Arundel, who was beheaded. &mdash; At twenty two years of age, from be|ing archdeacon of Taunton, he was rai&s;ed to the bi&s;hopric of Ely, the 6th of April, 1375, in the reign of Edward III. He was a great benefactor to the church and palace of this &s;ee; among other dona|tions, he gave a curious table of ma&s;&s;y gold, adorned with precious &s;tones, which had been given to prince Edward, by the King of Spain, and &s;old by the latter to bi&s;hop Arundel. In 1386, he was appointed Lord Chancellor of England; two years after, he was tran&s;lated to the &s;ee of York; and in 1396, was advanced to the archiepi&s;copal &s;ee of Canterbury, when he re&s;igned the chancellor|&s;hip. This was the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the tran&s;lation of an archbi&s;hop of York to the &s;ee of Canterbury. Scarce was he fixed in this &s;ee,
<PB N="272" REF="292">
when he had a conte&s;t with the univer&s;ity of Oxford, about the righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of vi&s;itation. The affair was referred to King Richard, who deter|mined it in favour of the archbi&s;hop. At his vi&s;itation in London, he revived an old con&s;titution, by which the inhabitants of the re|&s;pective pari&s;hes were obliged to pay to their rector one half-penny in the pound of the rent of their hou&s;es. In the &s;econd year of his tran&s;lation, a parliament being held at London, the commons, with the king's leave, impeached the archbi&s;hop, together with his brother the earl of Arundel, and the duke of Gloce&s;ter, of high trea&s;on. The archbi&s;hop was &s;entenced to be bani&s;hed, and within forty days to depart the kingdom on pain of death. He retired fir&s;t to France, and then to the court of Rome, where pope Boniface IX. gave him a kind reception, and wrote a letter to King Richard in his favour; but this having no effect, his holine&s;s re&s;olved to interpo&s;e his autho|rity: he accordingly nominated Arundel to the bi&s;hopric of St. An|drew's, and declared his intention of giving him &s;everal preferments in England. The king being informed of the pope's de&s;igns, wrote a letter to him in the following terms: "Thomas, for his trea&s;ona|ble con&s;piracy again&s;t our crown and royal dignity, has been &s;enten|ced only to perpetual bani&s;hment; whereas had he been dealt with, an&s;werably to his demerits, he ought to have &s;uffered the puni&s;hment of high trea&s;on; but in con&s;ideration of his character, and out of regard to religion, we have thought fit to grant him his life, and abated the rigor of the law. But &s;ince his going beyond &s;ea, both our&s;elf and our &s;ubjects are much &s;urprized at the turn of his fortune; for we are in|formed he has been invited to your holine&s;s's court, countenanced in his mi&s;behaviour, taken into your protection, and put in hopes of re|covering his &s;ee, or at lea&s;t of being promoted in our kingdom to be|nefices of greater value than tho&s;e he enjoyed before. How de&s;truc|tive &s;uch unaccountable favours as the&s;e mu&s;t be to our dignity and government, and to what apparent danger it may expo&s;e us, is ea&s;y to imagine: for which rea&s;on we are re&s;olved not to bear with &s;uch treatment, though the whole world were of a different opinion; for we are thoroughly acquainted with this man, we know him to be of a turbulent, &s;editious temper, who, if he were permitted to live in our dominions, would return to his old practices, poi&s;on our &s;ubjects with mi&s;reporting the admini&s;tration, and endeavour to undermine our government; for it is probable he would u&s;e &s;ufficient pre|caution not to fall under the la&s;h of the law. We de&s;ire, therefore, that your Holine&s;s would prevent the&s;e opportunities of mi&s;chief, and not &s;hock our intere&s;ts and inclinations by &s;uch favours; for &s;hould &s;uch mea&s;ures be put in execution, it is po&s;&s;ible they might create<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

&s;uch mi&s;under&s;tandings between the crown and the mitre, as it might prove difficult to remove: for, to &s;peak plainly, we cannot take that per&s;on for our friend, who care&s;&s;es our enemies, and takes them by the hand in &s;o loving a manner.

<P>Next year Arundel returned to England with the Duke of Lanca&s;ter, afterwards Henry IV. upon who&s;e acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, the pope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evoked the bull granted Walden, and re&s;tored Arundel to his &s;ee.

In the year 1408, Arundel began to exert him&s;elf again&s;t the Lollards, or Wickliffites: he &s;ummoned the bi&s;hops and clergy at Oxford, in order to &s;top the progre&s;s of this new &s;ect, and prevent the univer&s;ity's being farther tinctured with their opinions.

<HEAD>ATHELING (EDGAR),</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;on of Edward, the &s;on of Edmond Iron&s;ide, king of England, by Agatha, daughter to Solomon, king of Hungary, or rather of the Emperor Henry II. In what year he was born is not certain; but he was very young in 1057, when his father and family were recalled into their native country, by their kin&s;man Edward the Confe&s;&s;or, then king thereof. His father died &s;oon after his return, before the king had time to give him any e&s;&s;ential marks of that kindne&s;s which he profe&s;&s;ed to him. Edgar was carefully bred up by him, who was his great uncle, and was undoubtedly intended for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, as the be&s;t authors a&s;&s;ure us, and as his title Atheling,
<PB N="278" REF="298">
or Mo&s;t Noble, implies, which is rightly noted by Mr. Selden, cor|recting in this re&s;pect Polydore Virgil, who mi&s;took it for a &s;irname. But on king Edward's death, Edgar was deprived of his right, be|cau&s;e of his youth, his being born abroad, and his having too little experience for a crowned head in &s;uch trouble&s;ome times. Harold, the &s;on of Earl Godwin, chiefly through the intrigues of the clergy, was preferred before him, for which they are &s;everely cen&s;ured by &s;ome writers. This happened in the beginning of A. D. 1066, Ha|rold, however, treated him with great re&s;pect, as long as he lived; after who&s;e death and defeat in the fatal battle of Ha&s;tings, the nobles and people in general looked upon Edgar as king, and even acknow|ledged him as &s;uch. But William Duke of Normandy, awing them with his victorious army, was owned and crowned monarch of Eng|land, at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in the &s;ame year. To him, if we credit &s;ome of our ancient hi&s;torians, Edgar immediately &s;ubmitted, and was among&s;t the number of tho&s;e, whom William carried with him as ho&s;tages into Normandy. Other authors are &s;ilent on this head, but all agree, that in 1067, Edgar, attended by many of the prime nobility, retired fir&s;t into Northumberland, afterwards into Scotland. The per&s;ons who adhered to him, had &s;o con&s;iderable an intere&s;t both at home and abroad, that they quickly drew together a numerous army, and therewith began to bid fair for un&s;ettling the new e&s;tabli&s;hment. In 1068, king William &s;ent Robert Comyn into the north, in order to expel Edgar and his a&s;&s;ociates out of tho&s;e parts, con&s;tituting him Earl of Northumberland. But this great man had but an ill fate, being &s;lain by &s;uch forces as he had about him. The next year a great &s;ucco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r came to the&s;e malcontents from Denmark, and more Engli&s;h Lords reconciling them&s;elves to Edgar, he made head again&s;t the Normans, and after &s;everal &s;ucce&s;sful engagements, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city of York, and wintered between the Ou&s;e and Trent, notwith&s;tanding all efforts of the Conqueror. In 1070, he was le&s;s fortunate. William found means, by money and promi&s;es, to draw off the Danes and &s;ome of the Lords of his party, and in the end, obliged him again to retire into Scotland. Malcolm king of that country, married this year his &s;i&s;ter Margaret, &s;o excel|lent a woman, that in her life-time &s;he was &s;tyled the good, and after her decea&s;e, was regarded as a &s;aint. This marriage enabled Edgar to make new attempts, in which he had mo&s;tly the better, the king of Scots openly a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, notwith&s;tanding king William had demand|ed him, and threatened to invade Scotland in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. Some dome&s;tic troubles hindered that Prince from performing his threat for two years. In 1072, however, king William entered Scotland with
<PB N="279" REF="299">
an army, but with indifferent &s;ucce&s;s. Upon this he readily made peace with Malcolm, and reg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lated, according to ancient treaties, the bounds of their re&s;pective dominions. In this peace, the Scots hi&s;torians &s;ay Edgar Atheling was included, and, on his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, received into king William's favour, which is very probable, &s;ince the war was on his account. In 1074 Edgar left Scotland, where he had been &s;o kindly entertained, and where his &s;i&s;ter was queen. He cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea into Normandy, and was kindly received by king William, who gave him a grand allowance. Some of our authors &s;ay, it was a pound of &s;ilver a day, others twenty &s;hillings. However, he was therewith contented, and lived quietly. William of Malm&s;bury, his cotemporary (and who expre&s;sly takes notice that he was living when he wrote), &s;peaks of him in terms little to his advantage. He &s;ays he behaved meanly and fooli&s;hly in the king's court, and as an in&s;tance thereof, mentions his quitting his great allowance for a hor&s;e. But this is not very con&s;i&s;tent with the te&s;timonies of other authors, or with the general current of hi&s;tory. After this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, our hi&s;to|ries are &s;ilent concerning him for many years. This, however, is a plain proof, that he acted like a man of honour towards the Norman, &s;ince in that &s;pace there were many &s;tirs, of which he might have made his advantage. In 1086, that is about twelve years after his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, Edgar conceiving him&s;elf ill treated at court, retired f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m thence. This does not &s;eem to &s;peak him of quite &s;o mean a &s;pirit as Malm&s;bury would make him. Certain it is, that even now he had the hearts of the Engli&s;h nation; &s;ince in the old Abbey Chronicles, we meet with this prayer on the mention of his retreat, <HI>May the Almighty give him honour,</HI> alluding to the little re&s;pect &s;hewn him at court. But this retreat, however, was not without the king's con&s;ent. On the contrary, Edgar obtained licence to &s;ail with a certain number of &s;hips, and two hundred &s;oldiers on board, to Apu|lia. This therefore was no di&s;graceful flight, but rather an honourable exile. About the &s;ame time, his younger &s;i&s;ter, Chri&s;tina, became a nun in Ram&s;ay abbey. How long Edgar continued in Apulia is uncertain; yet, when he returned from thence, he went into Normandy, where he was well received by Duke Robert, who gave him certain lands for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Whether this was done to awe his brother William Rufus, who &s;eized the kingdom of England, or purely to provide for an unhappy prince, cannot now be determined. But in 1091, on the conclu&s;ion of a &s;olemn treaty between the brethren Robert and William, the latter procured Edgar Atheling's being di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his lands; upon which he withdrew out of Normandy, and went into Scotland, to his brother-in-law king Malcolm. In the

&s;ame year, this la&s;t mentioned prince rai&s;ed a pui&s;&s;ant army, and therewith invaded England, and carried away much &s;poil; on the news whereof both brothers ha&s;tened out of Normandy, and &s;ent a con|&s;iderable force on board tran&s;ports towards the North, that they might more &s;peedily a&s;&s;emble an army in tho&s;e parts; but being near Michaelmas, the weather proved &s;tormy, and mo&s;t of the men were lo&s;t. King William II. and Duke Robert, rai&s;ed, however, an army, and though it was winter, advanced therewith towards Scotland. Upon this Edgar interpo&s;ed, reconciled the two kings, and mediated a good peace. For this &s;ervice he was re&s;tored to king William's favour, and came back with the brothers to London. However, when Duke Robert returned into Normandy, Edgar cho&s;e to accom|pany him, either becau&s;e he loved him be&s;t, or feared him lea&s;t. This was in the beginning of 1092. His &s;tay in Normandy was but &s;hort, for the next year we find him again in England, attending on, and in favour with, William II. That prince re&s;ided at Glouce&s;ter about Ea&s;ter, and was there &s;o ill, that his death was expected. On the 24th of Augu&s;t, 1093, Malcolm king of Scots, importuned him by letters to regulate certain differences according to treaty, on which William &s;ummoned him to Glouce&s;ter, and &s;ent Edgar to conduct him. This he performed; but after all, king William treated Malcolm very ill, who returning into Scotland, levied an army, entered Northum|berland, and be&s;ieging the ca&s;tle of Alnwick, which had been unju&s;tly taken from him, he was there treacherou&s;ly &s;lain, together with his elde&s;t &s;on Edward. This unfortunate event could not but afflict Edgar exceedingly, e&s;pecially when he &s;aw his nephews deprived of their rights, the Scots &s;etting up Donald Bane, <HI>i. e.</HI> Donald the White, whom the Engli&s;h writers call Dufenald, for their king, who was bro|ther to Malcolm. Edgar &s;ent for his five nephews into England, and carefully brought them up; but not without &s;ome danger to him&s;elf, if we credit the Scots hi&s;torians. One Orgar reported to king William Rufus, that Edgar &s;hould &s;ay boa&s;tingly to his nephews, that the right to the Engli&s;h crown was in him and in them. Edgar denied the charge, and was allowed to ju&s;tify him&s;elf by combat: that is, he cho&s;e a knight to enter into the li&s;ts for him, who was &s;o happy as to conquer. Buchanan informs us, that the rea&s;on he did not fight in per|&s;on, was becau&s;e Edgar at this time was old and infirm: but in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he was mi&s;taken, Edgar not exceeding forty-three, and as we &s;hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ee, he went afterwards into Pale&s;tine. Two of Edgar's nephews died before they were of age, which hindered him from doing what he would otherwi&s;e have done for them. His third nephew, Edgar, growing towards man's e&s;tate, and the Scots inviting him when they
<PB N="281" REF="301">
were weary of his uncle, to accept the crown, he re&s;olved to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that undertaking. Applying therefore to king William, he procured a &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, and therewith marched to the borders of Scotland, where his forces quickly encrea&s;ed, &s;o as to enable him to look Donald in the face. It was in the winter of 1097, that he &s;et forward on this expedition, and in the next &s;pring, having de|feated and taken Donald pri&s;oner, he e&s;tabli&s;hed his nephew on the throne, and then came back again into England. After this we meet with no account of him, till &s;uch time as with Robert the &s;on of God|win, a famous knight, he undertook a journey into the Holy Land. It is probable this was in 1099. He was with Baldwin II. king of Jeru&s;alem, when be&s;ieged in Rama, and having, in their hazardous &s;ally, wherein they e&s;caped thence, lo&s;t his knight, he thought of returning. This was in 1102, and accordingly he came back &s;oon after into Europe, received great civilities from the Greek and Ger|man emperors, who importuned him to remain in their courts, which he civilly excu&s;ed, and continued his journey either into England or Normandy. Henry I. had now a&s;cended the Engli&s;h throne, and e&s;pou&s;ed Maud, Edgar's niece; he had therefore all imaginable rea&s;on to expect a good reception at court, which, however, he either did not find, or el&s;e, it may be, declined. For we are certain, that he was &s;ome &s;hort time after his return from the Ea&s;t, in Normandy, with Duke Robert, for whom he had a great kindne&s;s. He even remained firm in his friend&s;hip to him, when king Henry invaded his dominions, and was taken pri&s;oner fighting in his cau&s;e, as al&s;o was Duke Robert him&s;elf, at the fatal battle of Tenchebray, wherein the whole force of Normandy was routed; which fell out in the latter end of 1106. King Henry dealt very &s;everely with the re&s;t of the pri&s;oners; but as for Edgar, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him freely. This is the la&s;t time he is men|tioned in our hi&s;tories, and after his return into England, he went to pa&s;s the remainder of his days in the country; where, according to Malm&s;bury, he was living in 1120, when he mu&s;t have been &s;eventy or thereabouts. In what year he died, appears not, nor do we read that he was ever married. He was born during his father's exile, lo&s;t him when his life would have &s;ecured him a crown, &s;truggled, though to no purpo&s;e, again&s;t the Conqueror, was through his whole life, the &s;port of fortune, and died full of years in a dark ob&s;curity. To which we add, that till now, his life was never written, from a &s;uppo&s;ed want of materials, and from a real want of inclination, to glean from our ancient hi&s;torians, a multitude of little memorandums, concerning an injured unfortunate prince. This ju&s;tice we have at

length done to his memory, and the Engli&s;h Hi&s;tory; which, from this article, we hope will not appear quite &s;o barren, as &s;ome modern writers would repre&s;ent it.</P>

<HEAD>ATTERBURY (FRANCIS),</HEAD>
<P>BISHOP of Roche&s;ter in the reigns of Queen Anne and king George I. was born the 6th of March, 1662, at Middleton, or Mil|ton-Keynes, near Newport-Pagnel, in Buckingham&s;hire. He had his education in grammar learning at We&s;tmin&s;ter School: and from thence, in 1680, was elected a &s;tudent of Chri&s;t-Church college in Oxford: where he &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf for the politene&s;s of his wit and learning; and gave early proofs of his poetical talents, in a latin ver&s;ion of Mr. Dryden's <HI>Ab&s;alom and Achitophel,</HI> An Epigram on a <HI>Lady's Fan</HI>; and a Tran&s;lation of two <HI>Odes of Horace.</HI> He took the degree of Bachelor of Arts, June the thirteenth, 1684; and that of Ma&s;ter, April the twentieth, 1687. This year he made his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay in controver&s;ial writing, in a piece, entitled, <HI>An An&s;wer to &s;ome Con|&s;iderations on the Spirit of Martin Luther, and the Original of the Re|formation.</HI> During his &s;tay in the univer&s;ity, he is generally thought to have borne no incon&s;iderable part in the famous controver&s;y, be|tween Dr. Bentley, and the Honourable Mr. Charles Boyle (after|wards Earl of Orrery), concerning the genuinene&s;s of <HI>Phalaris's Epi&s;|tles</HI>; though Mr. Atterbury's name was not made u&s;e of on that occa|&s;ion. At what time he entered into holy orders, is not certainly known: but, in 1693, upon the death of his father, he made appli|cation to the Earl of Nottingham, to &s;ucceed in the rectory of Milton&punc; which he then called the height of his ambition and wi&s;hes, as being the place of his birth. But, being di&s;appointed in his expectation of this preferment, and long &s;ince tired of a college life, Mr. Atterbury re&s;olved to quit the univer&s;ity, and produce him&s;elf on a more active &s;tage: and accordingly, making London his re&s;idence, he &s;oon di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that he was appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to King William and Queen Mary, and was elected preacher at Bridewell, and Lecturer of St. Bride's. In 1694, our young divine preached a remarkable &s;ermon at Bridewell chapel, before the governors of that and Bethlehem ho&s;pital, on <HI>the Power of Charity to cover Sin</HI>; to which Mr. Benjamin Hoadly (&s;ince bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter) publi&s;hed &s;ome <HI>Exceptions.</HI> The &s;ame year he was warmly attacked for his &s;ermon, preached before the Queen at Whitehall; entitled, <HI>The Scorner incapable of True Wi&s;dom.</HI> But the large&s;t field of controver&s;y, in which he ever engaged, was that which opened it|&s;elf
<PB N="283" REF="303">
in the year 1700, and continued four years, between him, Dr. Wake (afterwards archbi&s;hop of Canterbury), and others, concerning <HI>the Rights Powers, and Privileges of Convocations:</HI> in which, how|ever, the truth of the que&s;tion may be &s;uppo&s;ed to lie, he di&s;played &s;o much learning and ingenuity, as well as zeal for the intere&s;ts of his order, that the Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation returned him their thanks, and the univer&s;ity of Oxford complimented him with the degree of Doctor in Divinity. January the twenty-ninth, 1700, he was in|&s;talled Archdeacon of Totne&s;s, being promoted to that dignity by Sir Jonathan Trelawny, then bi&s;hop of Exeter. The &s;ame year he was engaged with &s;ome other learned divines, in revi&s;ing an intended edition of the Greek Te&s;tament, with Greek Scholia, collected chief|ly from the fathers, by Mr. Archdeacon Gregory. Upon the acce&s;|&s;ion of Queen Anne, in 1702, Dr. Atterbury was appointed one of her Maje&s;ty's chaplains in ordinary; and, in October, 1704, he was ad|vanced to the deanery of Carli&s;le. About two years after this, he was engaged in a di&s;pute with Mr. Hoadly, concerning the advan|tages of <HI>Virtue</HI> with regard to the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> life, occa&s;ioned by his &s;er|mon, preached the thirtieth of Augu&s;t, 1706, at the funeral of Mr. Thomas Bennet, a book&s;eller. In 1707, Sir Jonathan Trelawny, then bi&s;hop of Exeter, appointed him one of the canons re&s;identiaries of that church; and, in 1709, Sir John Trevor, a great di&s;cerner of men and their abilities, was &s;o &s;truck with his fame, and charmed with his eloquence, that he made him preacher of the Rolls chapel. This year he was engaged in a fre&s;h di&s;pute with Mr. Hoadly, concern|ing pa&s;&s;ive obedience, occa&s;ioned by his Latin &s;ermon, entitled <HI>Concio ad Clerum Londinen&s;em habita in Eccle&s;ia S. Elphegi.</HI> In 1710, came on the famous trial of Dr. Sacheverell, who&s;e remarkable &s;peech on that occa&s;ion, was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to have been drawn up by our author, in conjunction with Dr. Smaldridge and Dr. Friend. The &s;ame year Dr. Atterbury was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en Prolocutor of the Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation, and had the chief management of af|fairs in that hou&s;e. The eleventh of May 1711, he was appointed by the convocation, one of the committee for comparing Mr. Whi&s;|ton's doctrines with tho&s;e of the Church of England; and, in June following, he had the chief hand in drawing up <HI>A Repre&s;entation of the pre&s;ent State of Religion.</HI> In 1712, Dr. Atterbury was made Dean of Chri&s;t-Church, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong intere&s;t and warm appli|cation of &s;everal great men, in behalf of his competitor Dr. Smal|dridge. The next year &s;aw him at the top of his preferment, as well as of his reputation: for in the beginning of June, 1713, the Queen, at the recommendation of the Earl of Oxford, advanced him to the
<PB N="284" REF="304">
bi&s;hopric of Roche&s;ter, and deanery of We&s;tmin&s;ter; and he was con|&s;ecrated at Lambeth the 4th of July following. It is &s;aid, he had in view the primacy of all England; and that his credit with the Queen and mini&s;try was &s;o con&s;iderable, and his &s;chemes &s;o well laid, as probably to have carried it, upon a vacancy, had not her Maje&s;ty's death, in Augu&s;t 1714, prevented him. At the beginning of the &s;ucceeding reign, his tide of pro&s;perity be|gan to turn; and he received a &s;en&s;ible mortification pre&s;ently after the coronation of King George I. when, upon his offering to pre|&s;ent his Maje&s;ty (with a view, no doubt, of &s;tanding better in his fa|vour) with the chair of &s;tate and royal canopy, his own perqui&s;ites, as Dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter, the offer was rejected, not without &s;ome evi|dent marks of di&s;like to his per&s;on. During the rebellion in Scotland, which broke out in the fir&s;t year of this reign, Bi&s;hop Atterbury gave an in&s;tance of his growing di&s;affection to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government, in refu&s;ing to &s;ign the Declaration of the bi&s;hops. Be&s;ides which, he con&s;tantly oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures of the Court in the Hou&s;e of Lords, and drew up &s;ome of the mo&s;t violent prote&s;ts with his own hand. Thus he went on till the year 1722, when the government having rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him of being concerned in a plot in favour of the Pretender; he was accordingly apprehended on the twenty-fourth of Augu&s;t, and committed pri&s;oner to the Tower. This com|mitment of a bi&s;hop, upon a &s;u&s;picion of high trea&s;on, as it was a thing rarely practi&s;ed &s;ince the reformation, &s;o it occa&s;ioned various &s;peculations among the people. On the twenty-third of March, 1722-3, a bill was brought into the Hou&s;e of Commons, for <HI>inflicting certain pains and penalties on Francis, Lord Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter</HI>; a copy of which was &s;ent to him, with notice that he had liberty of coun&s;el, and &s;olicitors for making his defence. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the bi&s;hop applied by petition to the Hou&s;e of Lords, for their direction and advice, as to his conduct in this conjuncture; and, on the 4th of April, he acquainted the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, by a letter, that he was determined to give that Hou&s;e no trouble, in rela|tion to the bill depending therein; but &s;hould be ready to make his de|fence again&s;t it, when it &s;hould be argued in another Hou&s;e, of which he had the honour to be a member. On the 9th, the bill pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons, and was the &s;ame day &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e of Lords for their concurrence. On the 6th of May, being the day ap|pointed by the Lords for the fir&s;t reading of the bill, Bi&s;hop Atterbury was brought to We&s;tmin&s;ter, to make his defence. The coun&s;el for the Bi&s;hop were, Sir Con&s;tantine Phipps, and William Wynne, E&s;q. for the king, Mr. Reeve and Mr. Wearg. The proceedings continued
<PB N="285" REF="305">
above a week; and on Saturday May the eleventh, the Bi&s;hop was permitted to plead for him&s;elf; which he did in a very eloquent &s;peech. On Monday the thirteenth, he was carried, for the la&s;t time, from the Tower, to hear the reply of the king's coun&s;el to his defence&punc; On the fifteenth, the bill was read the third time; and, after a very long and warm debate, pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;ixteenth, by a majority of eighty-th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee to forty-three. On the twenty-&s;eventh the king came to the Hou&s;e, and confirmed it by his royal a&s;&s;ent. It is &s;aid, his Maje&s;ty pa&s;&s;ed the bill with &s;ome regret, being much concerned, as he expre&s;&s;ed it, that there &s;hould be ju&s;t cau&s;e of dooming to perpetual bani&s;hment a bi&s;hop of the Church of England, and a man of &s;uch emi|nent parts and learning. To alleviate, however, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the &s;everity of this &s;entence, the Bi&s;hop's daughter, Mrs. Morrice, was permitted to attend her father in his travels: and his &s;on-in-law, Mr. Morrice, by virtue of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ign manual, had leave to corre&s;pond with him. On the eighteenth of June 1723, this emi|nent prelate, having the day before taken leave of his friends, who, from the time of pa&s;&s;ing the bill again&s;t him, to the day of his depar|ture, had free acce&s;s to him in the Tower, embarked on board the Aldborough man of war, and landed the Friday following at Calais. From thence he went to Bru&s;&s;els; and afterwards to Paris, where he re&s;ided till his death; &s;oftening the rigours of his exile by &s;tudy, and conver&s;ation with learned men; and by a con&s;tant epi&s;tolary corre|&s;pondence with the mo&s;t eminent &s;cholars, particularly with M. Thiriot, an ingenious French gentleman, for whom he had a great e&s;teem, and who has obliged the public with &s;ome of the bi&s;hop's original letters, which are chiefly <HI>Critiques</HI> on &s;everal French authors. Bi&s;hop Atter|bury died at Paris the fifteenth of February, 1731. His body was brought over to England, and interred the twelfth of May following, in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey. Some time before his death, he publi&s;hed a vindication of him&s;elf, Bi&s;hop Smaldridge, and Dr. Aldrich, from a charge brought again&s;t them by Mr. Oldmixon, of having altered and interpolated the copy of Lord Clarendon's Hi&s;tory of the Rebelli|on. Bi&s;hop Atterbury's Sermons are extant in four volumes in octavo: tho&s;e contained in the two fir&s;t were publi&s;hed by him&s;elf, and dedicated to his great patron Sir Jonathan Trelawny, bi&s;hop of Winche&s;ter; tho&s;e in the two la&s;t were publi&s;hed after his death, by Dr. Thomas Moore, his Lord&s;hip's chaplain. His epi&s;tolary cor|re&s;pondence with Mr. Pope, is extant in the collection of that poet's letters. As to Bi&s;hop Atterbury's character, however, the moral and political part of it may have been differently repre&s;ented by the oppo|&s;ite

Audley's conduct in this &s;tation, fully an&s;wered the king's expectations. The next year he was made attorney of the duchy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Lanca&s;ter; and May 20, 1532, upon the re&s;ignation of Sir Thomas Moore, the king delivered to him the great &s;eal, with the title of lord keeper, and at the &s;ame time conferred on him the honour of knight|hood. In January following, the king appointed him lord chancel|lor; and &s;oon after granted him the &s;cite of the priory of Chri&s;t Church near Aldgate, now called Duke's Place, with all the church-plate and lands belonging to that hou&s;e. In this high office he was as dili|gent in the king's bu&s;ine&s;s, as he had been when &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons; for in July 1535, he &s;at in judgment, and pronounced &s;en|tence of death upon Sir Thomas Moore, indicted of high trea&s;on, for refu&s;ing to acknowledge the king's &s;upremacy in the church. When &s;entence was pa&s;t, Sir Thomas &s;aid, that he had for &s;even years bent his mind and &s;tudy upon this cau&s;e, but as yet he found it no where writ by any approved doctor of the church, that a layman could be head of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate. To which Audley returned, 'Sir, will you be reckoned wi&s;er, or of a better con&s;cience, than all the bi&s;hops, the nobility, and the whole kingdom?'</P>
<P>As Audley had been very active in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the divorce, &s;o he had a large hand in the proceedings previous to the di&s;&s;olution of &s;uch religious hou&s;es as had not two hundred pounds by the year. His per&s;ua&s;ions, and the king's threats, having procured a bill to be pa&s;|&s;ed for this purpo&s;e (by which the king not only obtained all the lands of the &s;mall mona&s;teries, but al&s;o their jewels and rich move|ables), the next &s;tep was to prevail with the abbots of larger founda|tions to &s;urrender. Audley offered the abbot of Athelny a hundred marks per annum pen&s;ion, which he refu&s;ed, as too &s;mall a &s;um. With the abbot of St. O&s;ithes in E&s;&s;ex, he was more &s;ucce&s;sful: in a

letter to Cromwell the vi&s;itor-general, after mentioning that he had by great &s;olicitation prevailed with this eccle&s;ia&s;tic, he in&s;inuates, that his place of lord chancellor being very chargeable, he wi&s;hed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> king might be moved for an addition of &s;ome profitable offices. An upon making application for the great abbey of Walden in E&s;&s;ex, which with &s;ome difficulty he obtained, he extenuated its worth, and alleged that it would be but a rea&s;onable recompence for the great damage and infamy he had &s;uffered in &s;erving the king.</P>
<P>On the twenty-ninth of November, 1538, he was created baron Audley, of Walden in E&s;&s;ex, and in&s;talled knight of the garter. A little before his death he obtained from the king, a licence to change the name of Buckingham college in Cambridge, into that of Magda|len, or Maudlin. To this college he was a great benefactor, be&s;tow|ed on it his own arms, and is generally reputed its founder. He died on the la&s;t of April, 1544 (having held the &s;eals upwards of twelve years), and in the fifty-&s;ixth year of his life, as appears by the in|&s;cription on his tomb. Mr. Rapin &s;ays he was a man of &s;ound judg|ment, and was &s;erviceable to the reformers, whenever he could be &s;o, without any hazard or danger to him&s;elf; but was too much a cour|tier to in&s;i&s;t even upon what he judged rea&s;onable, if di&s;approved of by the king.

<P>By his lady Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Grey, Marquis of Dor|&s;et, he had two daughters, Margaret and Mary.

In the fir&s;t of king James I. he was created Earl of Suffolk, and afterwards lord high trea&s;urer of England.

<P>THE fir&s;t archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, was originally a monk in the convent of St. Andrew at Rome, and educated under St. Gregory, afterwards pope Gregory I. by whom he was di&s;patched into Britain,
<PB N="288" REF="310">
with forty other monks of the &s;ame order, about the year 596, to con|vert the Engli&s;h Saxons to Chri&s;tianity. They landed in the i&s;le of Thanet, and having &s;ent &s;ome French interpreters to king Ethelbert with an account of their errand, the king gave them leave to convert as many of his &s;ubjects as they could, and a&s;&s;igned their place of re&s;i|dence at Dorovernum, &s;ince called Canterbury, to which they were confined till the king him&s;elf was converted, who&s;e example had a powerful influence in promoting the conver&s;ion of his &s;ubjects, but though he was extremely plea&s;ed at their becoming Chri&s;tians, he never attempted to compel them. He had learned (&s;ays the venerable Bede) from his in&s;tructors in the way of &s;alvation, that force and dragooning was not the method of the Go&s;pel; that the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was to make its way by argument and per&s;ua&s;ion, to be matter of choice and not of compul&s;ion. Augu&s;tin, by direction of the pope, went afterwards to Arles in France, where he was con&s;ecrated arch|bi&s;hop and metropolitan of the Engli&s;h nation, by the archbi&s;hop of that place. On his return to Britain, he di&s;patched a prie&s;t and a monk to Rome, to acquaint the pope with the &s;ucce&s;s of his mi&s;|&s;ion and to de&s;ire his re&s;olution of certain que&s;tions. The&s;e men brought back with them a pall, and &s;everal books, ve&s;tments, uten&s;ils, and ornaments for the churches. His holine&s;s, by the &s;ame me&s;&s;engers, gave Augu&s;tin directions concerning the &s;ettling of epi&s;|copal &s;ees in Britain, and ordered him not to pull down the idol temples, but to convert them into Chri&s;tian churches, only de&s;troying the idols, and &s;prinkling the place with holy water, that the natives, by frequenting the temples they had been always accu&s;tomed to, might be the le&s;s &s;hocked at their entrance into Chri&s;tianity. And whereas it had been their cu&s;tom to &s;acrifice oxen to their fal&s;e gods, he advi&s;ed, that upon the anniver&s;ary of each church's con&s;ecration, the people &s;hould erect booths round about, and fea&s;t therein, not &s;a|crificing their oxen to devils, but killing them for their own refre&s;h|ment, and prai&s;ing God for the ble&s;&s;ing. He further cautioned him not to be puffed up with the miracles he was enabled to work in con|firmation of his mini&s;try; but to con&s;ider how much the Engli&s;h were the favourites of heaven, &s;ince God enabled him to alter the cour&s;e of nature to promote their conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Augu&s;tin fixed his &s;ee at Canterbury, and being &s;upported by the intere&s;t of king Ethelbert, made an attempt to &s;ettle a corre&s;pondence with the Briti&s;h bi&s;hops, and to bring them to conformity with the Roman church. To this purpo&s;e a conference was held at a place in Worce&s;ter&s;hire, &s;ince called Augu&s;tin's oak, but without &s;ucce&s;s. A &s;econd conference was propo&s;ed, at which the appearance was more numerous than at the former, &s;even Briti&s;h bi&s;hops, attending at it,
<PB N="289" REF="311">
with a great many learned monks from the mona&s;tery of Bancorna|burg, or Bangor, who were under the direction of their abbot Dinoth. The&s;e Britons, before they began their journey, applied to a certain hermit of eminent virtue and good &s;en&s;e, to know whether or not they &s;hould give up the u&s;ages and traditions of their church, and acknowledge the preten&s;ions of Augu&s;tine. He told them, that if Augu&s;tine &s;hould prove to be a man of God, they ought to be governed by him. They a&s;ked him how they &s;hould know this. The hermit replied,
<Q REND="inline">'Our Saviour &s;ays, "Take my yoke upon you, for I am meek and low in heart." If Augu&s;tin be affable and humble, he has probably taken Chri&s;t's yoke upon him, and offers you the &s;ame privilege: but if he be haughty and in&s;olent, it is plain he is not commi&s;&s;ioned from heaven, nor are his words to be regarded.'</Q>
The father a&s;ked, by what marks they were to di&s;cover his temper. The hermit de&s;ired them to manage it &s;o, that Augu&s;tin and his com|pany &s;hould be fir&s;t at the place, and if he ro&s;e to &s;alute them at their coming in, they might conclude he was &s;ent from God; but if he neglected this civility, they might return his contempt, and have no|thing to do with him. When the Britons came into the &s;ynod Augu&s;|tin received them &s;itting; in re&s;entment of which affront they warmly oppo&s;ed every thing he offered. The articles in&s;i&s;ted on by Augu&s;|tin were, that they &s;hould celebrate Ea&s;ter, and admini&s;ter bapti&s;m, according to the practice of the Romi&s;h church; and that they &s;hould acknowledge the Pope's authority: if they would comply in the&s;e re&s;pects, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the conver&s;ion of the Saxons, he would bear with the di&s;agreement of their cu&s;toms in other ca&s;es. But the Britons re|plied, they could yield none of the points conte&s;ted.</P>
<P>This apo&s;tle of the Engli&s;h died at Canterbury in the year 604. The popi&s;h writers a&s;cribe &s;everal miracles to him. The ob&s;erva|tion of the fe&s;tival of St. Augu&s;tin was fir&s;t enjoined in a &s;ynod held under Cuthbert archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, and afterwards by the pope's bull in the reign of king Edward III.</P>

<HEAD>AXTEL (DANIEL).</HEAD>
<P>A colonel in the &s;ervice of the long parliament, and executed for the &s;hare he had in the murder of King Charles I. The particulars of this gentleman's life, before he engaged in the &s;ervice of the Par|liament, are &s;o deeply buried in oblivion, that, notwith&s;tanding all the indu&s;try we have u&s;ed, a very few only, and tho&s;e of le&s;s con&s;e|quence than we could wi&s;h, can be brought to light. He was of a good family, and had a tolerable education, that is to &s;ay, &s;uch a one as might fit him for the cour&s;e of life it was intended he &s;hould lead,
<PB N="290" REF="312">
being placed by his relations as an apprentice to a grocer in Wat|ling-&s;treet. As he was of a very &s;erious di&s;po&s;ition, and had been very early tinctured with tho&s;e principles, which were in that age &s;tyled puritanical, he became an eager follower of &s;uch mini&s;ters as di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their zealous preaching. His great at|tachment to the&s;e &s;ort of people, and the natural warmth of his own temper, were the occa&s;ions of his quitting his own calling, and going into the army, to which he was principally determined, by keeping a day of fa&s;ting and prayer with Mr. Simeon A&s;h, Mr. Love, Mr. Woodcocke, and other mini&s;ters in Lawrence-lane, wherein, accord|ing to his judgment, they did &s;o clearly &s;tate the cau&s;e of the parlia|ment, that he was fully convinced of the ju&s;tice of their cau&s;e, and re&s;olved to venture his life for it. Such were the con&s;equences of the profe&s;&s;ors of the Chri&s;tian religion, converting their pulpits into &s;chools of politics, to which it may truly be &s;aid, the civil wars owed its beginning, as mo&s;t of the di&s;mal con&s;equences with which it was attended, flowed but too apparently from the &s;ame &s;ource. After having thus cho&s;en his party, he behaved in the army with &s;o much zeal, courage, and conduct, that he ro&s;e by degrees to the &s;e|veral commands, of Captain, Major, and Lieutenant Colonel, in a regiment of foot. It was in this la&s;t capacity, that he acted with great vehemence again&s;t all endeavours for a reconciliation with the King, and particularly concurred in exhibiting a charge of high trea|&s;on, again&s;t eleven members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, for betraying the cau&s;e of the Parliament, endeavouring to break and de&s;troy the army, with other particulars, which obliged tho&s;e gentlemen to with|draw, which was the fir&s;t force put upon that hou&s;e of commons, and the remembrance of the concern C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lonel Axtel had therein, contri|buted not a little to his de&s;truction. Upon &s;everal changes that after|wards happened, the&s;e members were again admitted, &s;at and voted in the hou&s;e, and new &s;chemes were entered upon, for re&s;toring the con|&s;titution by &s;ettling the government, in order to which the hou&s;e of commons, on the fifth of December, 1648, re&s;olved,
<Q REND="inline">'That his Ma|je&s;ty's conce&s;&s;ions to the propo&s;itions upon the treaty of the I&s;le of Wight, were &s;ufficient grounds for the hou&s;es to proceed upon for the &s;ettl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment of the kingdom.'</Q>
But a great party in the army who thought otherwi&s;e, determined to prevent the effects of this; and accordingly placed one Colonel Pride with a guard at the door of the parliament hou&s;e, having in his hands a li&s;t of tho&s;e members who were to be excluded. Accordingly he prevented all of them from entering the hou&s;e, and &s;ecured &s;ome of them who were mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected, under a guard provided for that purpo&s;e; which act of his was &s;uppo&s;ed,

by &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t men in England, to di&s;&s;olve and de&s;troy the re|pre&s;entatives of the Commons of England, and to leave tho&s;e who re|mained and acted, without any legal authority. Yet this remnant of the Hou&s;e of Commons, on the thirteenth of December, revived the vote of non-addre&s;&s;es, and though they were but twenty-&s;ix in number, took upon them to i&s;&s;ue a commi&s;&s;ion for trying the King, pa&s;&s;ing a vote on New-year's day, <HI>That it was trea&s;on in the King, to levy war again&s;t the Parliament.</HI> On the ninth of January, the trial of the King was proclaimed by &s;ound of trumpet, and beat of drum, in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, at the Old Exchange, and in Cheap&s;ide; and all people were &s;ummoned who had any thing to &s;ay again&s;t the King, to appear and be heard. On the twentieth of January, when the King was brought before the High Court of Ju&s;tice, Colonel Stubberd, and Colonel Axtel, had the command of the &s;oldiers be|low &s;tairs. The King demanded of Serjeant Brad&s;haw, who was the Pre&s;ident, by what authority they brought him there? And the Pre&s;ident appealing to the charge, which was in the name of the Commons and People of England, Lady Fairfax, the General's wife, cried out, <HI>It is a lie, it is fal&s;e, not a half, not a quarter of the people,</HI> Oliver Cromwell <HI>is a rogue and a traitor</HI>; which words were repeated by Mrs. Nel&s;on. Upon this Colonel Axtel cried out, <HI>Down with the whores, &s;hoot them</HI>; which vehemence of his made him be taken notice of. The people, at the time of his Maje&s;ty's pa&s;&s;ing to his trial, moved by the &s;adne&s;s of the &s;ight, cried out, <HI>God &s;ave the KING!</HI> which obliged &s;uch as drove on his death, to procure another cry to countenance their de&s;ign, and therefore Colonel Ax|tel beat the &s;oldiers till they cried, <HI>Ju&s;tice! Ju&s;tice!</HI> And on the la&s;t day of the trial, when the common people cried, <HI>God pre&s;erve your Maje&s;ty!</HI> the &s;oldiers were again taught, by the prevailing argument of the cane, to cry out, <HI>Execution! Execution!</HI> After the &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed, the King was carried through the middle of King-&s;treet, in a common &s;edan, by two porters, who, out of reverence to his per&s;on, went bare-headed, till the &s;oldiers, under Colonel Axtel's command, beat them, and forced them to put on their hats. After the murder of the King, when Cromwell was &s;ent into Ireland, the regiment in which Colonel Axtel &s;erved, was drawn out by lot for that expedition, which occa&s;ioned his going over into that kingdom, where he made a con&s;iderable figure, was much e&s;teemed and tru&s;ted by Cromwell, and rai&s;ed, for his fidelity, courage, and con|duct, as General Ludlow tells us, to the command of a regiment, and the government of Kilkenny and the adjacent precinct, which important tru&s;t, Ludlow farther tells us, he di&s;charged with diligence
<PB N="292" REF="314">
and &s;ucce&s;s, and in his &s;tation &s;hewed a more than ordinary zeal in puni&s;hing tho&s;e Iri&s;h who had been guilty of murdering the Prote&s;tants. Other writers repre&s;ent this in quite a different light, and charge him with &s;everities, not at all inferior in cruelty to tho&s;e committed by the Iri&s;h rebels them&s;elves. After Cromwell, on the twentieth of April, 1653, had turned the Long Parliament out of the Hou&s;e, things took another turn; and he having a&s;&s;umed the &s;upreme power to him&s;elf, &s;ent over his &s;on, Henry, to Ireland, where he commanded at fir&s;t as Major-General, and by his endeavours to e&s;tabli&s;h the new govern|ment, &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted all the godly, but more particularly the Anabapti&s;ts, that on the twenty-eighth of November, 1656, they &s;ent Major Jones, and one Mr. Doyley, to acquaint him, that Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General Vernon, Adjutant Allen, Colonel Barrowe, and Colonel Axtel, de|&s;ired to &s;peak with him; upon which he offered to confer with them immediately. As &s;oon as they came into his pre&s;ence, Colonel Barrowe, premi&s;ing his and their many per&s;onal obligations received from the Major-General, told him, that finding them&s;elves of late not made u&s;e of, they could not, with &s;atisfaction to their con&s;ciences, receive pay from the public, without doing &s;ervice for it, and, therefore, came to acquaint him, that they had, upon &s;olemn &s;eeking of God, and &s;erious deliberation with them&s;elves, repre&s;ented to his Highne&s;s and the Lord Deputy, their re&s;olutions to quit their commands, and had &s;ent their rea&s;ons for doing it; &s;ignifying that they had re&s;erved the delivering up of their commi&s;&s;ions to the Major-General, as a particular mark of their re&s;pect for him; wherefore he did, in his own, and in the name of the re&s;t of the officers, declare, that they were from thenceforward di&s;charged from any public employment in the army; and at the &s;ame time they all of them tendered their commi&s;&s;ions, which the Major-General however did not think fit to accept; but they having publicly declared, that they looked upon their offer as a &s;ufficient di&s;charge, he thought fit to appoint them another meeting, the next day, in the afternoon. He told them at this meeting, that he was very &s;orry to find they were &s;o re&s;olute in what they propo&s;ed the day before, as to giving up their commi&s;&s;ions, and that it was no plea&s;ant thing to him to receive them from per&s;ons who had &s;o long &s;erved the public as they had done. If they quitted indeed upon a con&s;cientious di&s;&s;atisfaction, he knew not well what to reply, but that he hoped, when he parted with them the day before, that they would have given him time to have rea&s;oned the matter with them, and not have put him upon giving &s;o &s;udden an an&s;wer. But &s;ince con&s;idering how po&s;itive they had been, and that they had, contrary to his expectation, and that not in &s;o decent a manner as he could have wi&s;hed, made it the talk of the town, he thought him&s;elf concerned forthwith to declare his acceptance
<PB N="293" REF="315">
of their propo&s;al; and that he &s;hould take care, &s;ince they in&s;i&s;ted &s;o earne&s;tly upon it, without any provocation of his, and contrary to his de&s;ires, they &s;hould be fairly di&s;charged the army, and &s;atisfied what was due to each of them; and that &s;ince they were re&s;olved to retire, he &s;hould wi&s;h them well in their private capacities, and &s;hew them all re&s;pect befitting the place he &s;tood in there; and hoped that they would mind the promi&s;e they made the day before, of &s;erving God, and being always ready to &s;erve the public in order thereto. Upon this they &s;eemed to expre&s;s great thankfulne&s;s, and very high &s;atisfaction in the choice they had made; only Colonel Axtel having fir&s;t premi&s;ed, that he thought him&s;elf now on a level with the Major-General, complained in very rough and bitter language of the ill u&s;age he had met with, and the &s;lights that had been put upon him &s;ince the great Revolution in England, and the power of the Parliament had been devolved upon a &s;ingle per&s;on, which Mr. Cromwell bore as patiently as he could; but it appears clearly enough from the letters he wrote to Secretary Thurloe, that he was extremely &s;en&s;ible of the u&s;age he had met with, and looked upon the&s;e people, as ab&s;olutely di&s;affected both to the government in general, and to his family in particular. The condition of Colonel Axtel from this time was very unplea&s;ant. He lived in a private condition upon the e&s;tate he had acquired in the &s;er|vice; but in&s;tead of that power and authority which he had exerci&s;ed for &s;ix years together over the town and di&s;trict of Kilkenny, he was now in the &s;tate of a di&s;affected man, and not only without tru&s;t and without authority, but al&s;o &s;o much &s;u&s;pected by his &s;uperiors, that he could not take the &s;lighte&s;t journey about his private affairs, without having &s;pies &s;et over him, and being frequently called to account. All this was occa&s;ioned by the wild principles and re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits of the Anabapti&s;ts, which as they had brought about the &s;ubver&s;ion, fir&s;t of one government, and then of another, were now grown as turbulent under a third. Yet Henry Cromwell, when ve&s;ted with the character of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, was contented to watch over them without per&s;ecuting them; and, except the great jealou&s;y that he expre&s;&s;ed of their motions, he kept his word with them very exactly, and treated them as well as they could expect. After the death of the Protector, Oliver, which happened on the third of September, 1658, things took a new turn, and his &s;on Richard, who had a&s;&s;umed the title of Protector, immediately after his father's death, &s;aw him&s;elf, in the beginning of the next year, reduced to the fatal nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;|&s;olving, what he called a Parliament, with which ended his authority; and on the &s;eventh of May, 1659, the remnant of the Long Parlia|ment re&s;umed the power of which they had been deprived by Crom|well; and his &s;on Henry, who commanded as Lord Lieutenant in
<PB N="294" REF="316">
Ireland, having &s;ubmitted, as well as his brother Richard, Lieutenant-General Edmund Ludlow was &s;ent over to take the &s;upreme authority there, and one of the fir&s;t things he did, being to new-model the army, Colonel Axtel came again into play, had a regiment given him, and was one of the few per&s;ons, in whom Ludlow chiefly con|fided. It may not be ami&s;s to remark, that though this gentleman changed his opinion with re&s;pect to church matters, and of a Pre&s;by|terian became an Anabapti&s;t, yet, as to his notions of civil government he remained &s;omewhat more &s;teady, and was always looked upon as a zealous friend to a commonwealth. It was this di&s;po&s;ition of his, and his clear reputation for courage and conduct, as an officer, that in|duced General Ludlow to make choice of him, to command one di|vi&s;ion of the Iri&s;h brigade, that was &s;ent over to maintain the parlia|ment in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their authority, and to keep out the king, which however they were &s;o far from doing, that they contributed very much to his return. The ri&s;ing of Sir George Booth, which happened in Augu&s;t the &s;ame year, was the occa&s;ion of their being tran&s;ported to England; but they had no &s;hare in reducing him, which was per|formed before their arrival, by Major-General Lambert. Their coming, however, was e&s;teemed of great &s;ervice to the parliament, though it proved otherwi&s;e; for Colonel Zanchy, who commanded them, concurred with the army in putting a new force upon that a&s;|&s;embly, which la&s;ted till Chri&s;tmas, and then the Rum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as it was called, was again re&s;tored by the terror of Monk's army, which was marching out of Scotland. As he at the beginning declared po&s;i|tively for the Parliament, Colonel Axtel, and the re&s;t of the officers of the Iri&s;h brigade, kept that body of troops which were e&s;teemed the be&s;t in the kingdom, from acting again&s;t him, which if they had done in conjunction with Lambert, his de&s;ign in all probability had mi&s;carried. But as Monk very well knew that tho&s;e forces would never concur in re&s;toring the king, while under the officers who then commanded them, he re&s;olved to try whether it might not be po&s;&s;ible, to engage them fir&s;t to change their officers, and then to fall into his mea&s;ures, which was the mo&s;t critical point he had to manage. They were at that time quartered in York&s;hire, and thither he &s;ent Colonel Redman, who commanded part of tho&s;e troops in Ireland, under Henry Cromwell, and who was turned out by Ludlow. He carried with him &s;ome of his friends who had &s;erved under him, and on his fir&s;t appearance, the be&s;t part of the Iri&s;h brigade very fairly told Colonel Zanchy, and Colonel Axtel, that they might take what mea|&s;ures they thought fit, but for them&s;elves, they were determined to &s;erve under Colonel Redman, and their old officers. This revolt gave
<PB N="295" REF="317">
the death's wound to the republic; for Colonel Redman, pur&s;uant to the orders he had received from General Monk, immediately march|ed that body of old troops into Che&s;hire, which &s;o weakened Lam|bert's army, that was before &s;uperior to Monk's, that it left him in no condition to oppo&s;e the march of that general to London, which Colonel Axtel perceiving, re&s;olved to &s;hift for him&s;elf, and being thenceforward deprived of all command, endeavoured to &s;ettle his private affairs, and &s;ecure him&s;elf the be&s;t way he could. But when a fre&s;h opportunity offered of a&s;&s;erting the good old cau&s;e, Colonel Axtel &s;hewed his affection to it, by venturing his life in a very de&s;perate undertaking, and that too as a private man. The occa&s;ion was this: the Council of State had committed General Lambert to the Tower, in the beginning of the month of March; but on the ninth of April 1660, he made his e&s;cape from thence, and got down as far as Daventry in Northampton&s;hire, where, having a&s;|&s;embled a con&s;iderable body of hor&s;e, he was joined by Colonel Okey, Colonel Axtel, Colonel Cobbet, Lieutenant Colonel Young, Major Creed, Captain Timothy Clare, Captain Gregory, Captain Spinage, be&s;ides divers &s;oldiers that were Anabapti&s;ts. Colonel Richard Ingold&s;by, and Colonel Streater, who were &s;ent to reduce Lambert, followed him with &s;uch diligence, that on Ea&s;ter-day, which was on that year on the twenty-&s;econd of April, they came up with him in a plain near Daventry, having only a brook between them. When the two bodies came near, ju&s;t as Colonel Ingold&s;by was going to charge, Streater commanded &s;ix files of mu&s;queteers to advance. One file gave fire, and hurt one or two of Lambert's hor&s;e. His drums beat, and in good order he advanced, having given &s;trict command, that his mu&s;queteers &s;hould not fire, till they came as near as pu&s;h of pike. But Lambert's men held the no&s;es of their pi&s;tols towards the ground, and Nelthorp's troop came off to In|gold&s;by, Ha&s;lerigg's troop having de&s;erted him before. For Colonel Ingold&s;by &s;ending Captain El&s;emore before him with a party, as he marched to find Lambert, met Captain Ha&s;lerigg, and took him pri&s;oner, but relea&s;ed him upon his parole, to &s;end his whole troop over to join Ingold&s;by, which he faithfully performed, &s;ending it to them by his quarter-ma&s;ter; but he retired him&s;elf. Colonel In|gold&s;by told Lambert he was his pri&s;oner; whereupon Creed and the re&s;t earne&s;tly intreated him to do what he plea&s;ed with them, but to let Lambert e&s;cape, acquainting him that his life could be of no advan|tage to him; which Ingold&s;by ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed, telling them, that he would not be treacherous to tho&s;e that had commanded him, by &s;uch an ungenerous act. Lambert then turned about his hor&s;e, and at|tempted
<PB N="296" REF="318">
to make his e&s;cape; but Ingold&s;by pur&s;ued him &s;o clo&s;e, that he came quickly up to him, and vowed to pi&s;tol him if he did not im|mediately yield. Lambert, in great depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, twice prayed him to let him e&s;cape; but when he &s;aw he could not pre|vail, &s;ubmitted as well as the re&s;t did, except Okey, Axtel, and Clare, who e&s;caped. This was the la&s;t &s;truggle that was made in fa|vour of the Commonwealth; and Axtel u&s;ed his utmo&s;t indu&s;try af|terwards to conceal him&s;elf, as fore&s;eeing that it would not be long before he might be called to an account, for the large &s;hare he had taken in the trial of the king: but his care in this re&s;pect was to very little purpo&s;e, for before the clo&s;e of the month, he was di&s;covered and committed to pri&s;on. We are told by one of his friends, that he was betrayed by a royali&s;t, who having engaged him to a meeting, on pretence of treating with him for the purcha&s;e of &s;ome lands, gave notice of the time and place, by which he was apprehended and com|mitted to the Tower. After the King's Re&s;toration, the bill of indem|nity being then depending in the Hou&s;e of Commons, they, on the fourteenth of June, 1660, re&s;olved, <HI>That</HI> Daniel Axtel <HI>&s;hould be one of the</HI> Twenty <HI>excepted out of that bill.</HI> On the twelfth of July fol|lowing, a warrant was &s;ent for his detention in the Tower, for high trea&s;on. On the twenty-ninth of Augu&s;t, the King pa&s;&s;ed the &s;o long expected act, of free and general pardon, out of which only two and fifty per&s;ons were excepted, of which Colonel Daniel Axtel was the fiftieth, as al&s;o the two per&s;ons di&s;gui&s;ed in frocks and vizors, who appeared upon the &s;caffold at the murder of King Charles I. which per&s;ons were left to be proceeded again&s;t as traitors, according to the laws of England. On the tenth of October follow|ing, the grand jury for the county of Middle&s;ex, having found bills again&s;t twenty-eight per&s;ons, for their concern in the king's murder, of which Mr. Axtel was the la&s;t, they were brought to the &s;e&s;&s;ions hou&s;e in the Old Bailey, where Colonel Axtel was the &s;ame day arraigned, upon an indictment for compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the death of the late King; when for &s;ome time he refu&s;ed to plead, alleging that what he had done was in pur&s;uance of an Act of Parliament, and therefore he conceived no inferior court ought to judge of it; to which point he de&s;ired he might have coun&s;el a&s;&s;igned. But the Court having rea&s;oned with him, and told him, that in ca&s;e of trea|&s;on, it was the &s;ame thing to &s;tand mute, as to confe&s;s the indictment he was prevailed upon to plead Not Guilty. When he was a&s;ked How he would be tried? and told that the proper an&s;wer was, By God and his country; he &s;aid that was not lawful, <HI>God not being locally pre|&s;ent:</HI> however, he &s;oon after made the u&s;ual an&s;wer, and put him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="297" REF="319">
upon his trial. This did not come on till the 15th of October, 1660, when, after challenging ten of the jury, the indictment was opened, in which the Coun&s;el for the Crown ob&s;erved, That the High Court erected for the trial of the late King, had all the formalities of a court, &s;uch as their Pre&s;ident, their Council, their Chaplain, and Guards; and as &s;ome of their Judges, one of their Coun&s;el, and their Chaplain had been already tried, they had now brought this gentleman to the bar, as the Commander of the Guard, and then pro|ceeded to call their evidence. Mr. Holland Simp&s;on proved, that Colonel Axtel had the command of the &s;oldiers below &s;tairs, and threa|tened to &s;hoot Lady Fairfax for di&s;turbing the Court. Colonel Her|cules Huncks depo&s;ed, that on the day the King died, him&s;elf, Colo|nel Phayre, Colonel Hacker, and Cromwell, being in a room together, Cromwell de&s;ired him to &s;ign a warrant for the King's execution; which he having refu&s;ed to do, and Cromwell having given him &s;ome har&s;h language on that account, Mr. Axtel &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">'Colonel Huncks, I am a&s;hamed of you, the &s;hip is now coming into the harbour, and will you &s;trike &s;ail before we come to an anchor.'</Q>
Mr. Axtel po&s;i|tively denied this, and told Colonel Huncks, that him&s;elf was named in the warrant for execution, and that he wi&s;hed he did not make others a peace-offering to &s;ave him&s;elf. Sir Purbeck Temple &s;wore, That Mr. Axtel beat the &s;oldiers to make them cry, <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Execu|tion!</HI> That he laughed and &s;coffed with them during the trial, and that he &s;uffered, and, as the witne&s;s believed, procured the &s;oldiers to fire powder in the palms of their hands, which threw &s;uch clouds of &s;moke into the King's face, that he was obliged to ri&s;e out of his chair, and beat it off with his hand. Mr. John Jeonar, who was one of the King's dome&s;tic &s;ervants, and attended him at the trial, gave po&s;itive evidence, that when the Court broke up the fir&s;t day, Colonel Axtel ordered the Guards to cry, <HI>Ju&s;tice, Ju&s;tice!</HI> and the la&s;t day, <HI>Execution, Execution!</HI> And he farther depo&s;ed, that being very near the Colonel, he heard him lead that cry, by making u&s;e of the &s;ame words him&s;elf. One Samuel Burden, who had been a &s;oldier in the King's army, but at the time of the trial in Colonel Axtel's regiment, &s;wore, that him&s;elf and others were commanded by the Colonel to give evidence again&s;t the King, and for that purpo&s;e were &s;ent to Mr. Cook, who managed the charge again&s;t the King, to have their exami|nations taken, which was accordingly done. This man likewi&s;e &s;wore, that the Colonel &s;ent one Eli&s;ha Axtel with a file of &s;oldiers to take boat and go down to the common hangman, who lived beyond the Tower, in order to fetch him to execute the King. Lieutenant Colo|nel Nel&s;on depo&s;ed, That in private conver&s;ation at Dublin, Colonel Axtel acknowledged to him, that he was concerned in the &s;ecret of
<PB N="298" REF="320">
managing the King's execution; and being de&s;ired by the witne&s;s to tell him who the per&s;ons were that appeared upon the &s;caffold in vizors, he told him they were two &s;erjeants, well known both to him and to the witne&s;s, and that their names were Hewlet and Walker. Such was the evidence given to &s;upport the charge in the indictment, for compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the death of the King. In his defence Colonel Axtel alledged, that he was a commi&s;&s;ioned officer under the Lord Fairfax, as he had been before under the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, and by his commi&s;&s;ion was to obey his &s;uperior officer (who commanded him that day to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall), according to the cu&s;toms of war; &s;o that if he had di&s;obeyed his &s;uperior officer, then he had died, and now mu&s;t die for obeying him. But the Court told him he might have refu&s;ed without any danger as well as Colonel Huncks; and that <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> as well as <HI>active</HI> obedience was required from every man, and that neither his nor his &s;uperiors commi&s;&s;ion bid him kill his fa|ther, much le&s;s the father of his country. As for the mu&s;quets, mounted towards the lady, he &s;aid, that if a lady grew uncivil to di&s;|turb the Court, he could do no le&s;s than check her: That his &s;triking the &s;oldiers for not crying <HI>Ju&s;tice!</HI> was a mi&s;take; for he &s;aid he &s;truck them becau&s;e they did it, &s;aying, <HI>I'll give you Ju&s;tice</HI>: That his inciting them at the &s;entence to cry <HI>Execution, was the Execution of Ju&s;tice,</HI> and that could do no hurt. The court took a good deal of pains to &s;hew him the in&s;ufficiency of the&s;e pretences, and how in|compatible they were with the con&s;titution of this kingdom, and the laws of the land, upon which &s;ubject we met with a very curious and in&s;tructive pa&s;&s;age, in the Reports of a very learned Judge. The trial la&s;ted, on account of the pri&s;oner's long and large defence, for upwards of three hours; but the Jury, without going from the bar, found him guilty. On the &s;ixteenth of October, he was brought up again to the Se&s;&s;ions-hou&s;e, in order to receive &s;entence, at which time Mr. Axtel in&s;i&s;ted, that there was no overt-act proved again&s;t him &s;ufficient to &s;upport the indictment, and &s;ugge&s;ted, that he died only for want of words; upon which the Lord Chief Baron ob&s;erved, that it was otherwi&s;e, that he was pre&s;ent in the Court, beating the &s;oldiers, and &s;ending for an executioner, which were all of them facts, and not words. Upon this Colonel Axtel appealed to God, that he did not find him&s;elf guilty of con&s;ulting, contriving, or having any hand in the death of the King; and concluded that he was innocent, and prayed God that his blood might not cry again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Then &s;ilence being commanded, the Lord Chief Baron made a long &s;peech, in which he told Colonel Francis Hacker and Mr. Axtel, that they had no cau&s;e to hope for mercy, nor was there any room for
<PB N="299" REF="321">
mercy, and then pronounced that &s;entence which is u&s;ually given in ca&s;es of high-trea&s;on. After he was carried back to Newgate, he &s;hewed him&s;elf very full of &s;pirit and courage, &s;poke to every body that was about him with great vehemence and zeal for the cau&s;e in which he died, as appears very fully from the account of his behaviour, printed after his death, by the care of tho&s;e of his party. In this di&s;|po&s;ition he continued, without the lea&s;t alteration, or &s;inking of his &s;pirits, which mu&s;t be attributed to his notions of religion, that had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind, as entirely prevented his feel|ing any thing of that weakne&s;s and terror which is incident to human nature, at the near approach of death, and of a violent and &s;hameful death especially. But the account before-mentioned &s;hews us, that he remained firm to the la&s;t, and &s;poke with the &s;ame freedom that day he died, as on any other in his whole life. On Friday the nineteenth of October, about nine in the morning, Colonel Francis Hacker, and Co|lonel Daniel Axtel, were drawn on one hurdle, from Newgate to Ty|burn, where they behaved with great boldne&s;s and re&s;olution, more e&s;pecially the latter, who was the better &s;peaker of the two, and who did not fail to ju&s;tify his conduct to the people, with the &s;ame &s;ort of arguments he had u&s;ed before his Judges. After the execution was per|formed, the head of Colonel Axtel was &s;et up at the further end of We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and his quarters were in like manner di&s;po&s;ed of &s;o as to become &s;pectacles, in other public places. But the body of Mr. Hacker was, by his Maje&s;ty's great favour, given entire to his friends, and by their care was decently interred. At the time of his death, the Colonel left behind him a widow and &s;even children, for who&s;e &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence he had made a competent provi&s;ion in the time of his pro|&s;perity.</P>

<HEAD>AYSCUE, AYSCOUGH, or ASKEW, (Sir GEORGE)</HEAD>
<P>An eminent Engli&s;h Admiral in the la&s;t century. He was de&s;cended from a very good family in Lincoln&s;hire, and entered early into the &s;ea &s;ervice, where he obtained the character of an able and expe|rienced officer, and the honour of knighthood from King Charles I. This, however, did not prevent him from adhering to the Parlia|ment, when, by a very &s;ingular intrigue, they got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fleet, and &s;o zealous he was in the &s;ervice of his ma&s;ters, that when, in 1648, the greate&s;t part of the navy went over to the Prince of Wales, he, who then commanded the Lion, &s;ecured that &s;hip for the Parliamient, which was by them e&s;teemed both an acceptable &s;ervice, and an action of great importance. As this was a &s;ufficient proof of his fidelity, he had the command given him in a &s;quadron, that was
<PB N="300" REF="322">
employed to watch the motions of the Prince of Wales; and accord|ingly &s;ailed therewith to the coa&s;t of Ireland, where, by his vigilance, he prevented his Highne&s;s from doing what he would otherwi&s;e have done, and by his great intere&s;t with the &s;eamen he drew many of them back to that &s;ervice from which they had de&s;erted. This re|commended him &s;trongly to the Parliament, who, the next year, &s;ent him with a con&s;iderable number of &s;hips, and the honourable title of Admiral in tho&s;e &s;eas, to the coa&s;t of Ireland, which commi&s;|&s;ion he di&s;charged with equal vigour and vigilance, &s;upplying Dublin with provi&s;ions, attending the army upon all emergencies, and con|tributing in every re&s;pect &s;o effectually to the reduction of Ireland, that the Parliament not only thought fit to continue him in his com|mand for another year, but likewi&s;e ordered an immediate provi&s;ion to be made for the payment of his arrears, and pre&s;ented him with one hundred pounds, as a &s;pecial mark of their favour, and the ju&s;t re|ward of his &s;ervices. After the war was fini&s;hed in Ireland, and the Parliament had thereby time and opportunity, to think of the proper means of &s;ubduing the re&s;t of the dominions of the crown of Eng|land to their obedience, Sir George Ay&s;cue had orders to &s;ail with a &s;mall &s;quadron, to reduce the i&s;land of Barbadoes; but before he was in any readine&s;s to &s;ail, his orders were countermanded. The rea&s;on of this was, that the Parliament had received information, that the Dutch were treating with Sir John Grenville, in order to have the i&s;les of Scilly put into their hands, and therefore it was thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to reduce the&s;e i&s;lands fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Blake and Ay&s;cue were employed in this expedition, in the &s;pring of the year 1651, and performed it with honour and &s;ucce&s;s. They had but a &s;mall body of troops on board, and Sir John Grenville had a con|&s;iderable force in the i&s;land of St. Mary, commanded by &s;ome of the be&s;t officers in the late King's army; &s;o that if tho&s;e di&s;putes had been decided by the &s;word, the engagement mu&s;t have been both bloody and doubtful. Sir John ea&s;ily perceived that this mu&s;t end fa|tally in re&s;pect to him, and the King's forces under his command, and, therefore, entered into a treaty with General Blake, and Admiral Ay&s;|cue, who u&s;ed him very honourably, and gave him fair conditions; after which Blake returned to England, and Ay&s;cue proceeded on his voyage to Barbadoes. The Parliament, when they heard of the re|duction of Scilly, were extremely well plea&s;ed, as indeed they had rea&s;on, &s;ince privateers from thence did &s;o much mi&s;chief, that &s;carcely any trade could be carried on with tolerable &s;ecurity. But when the conditions were known &s;ome great men changed their opinions, and gave Blake to under&s;tand, that he and his colleague had been too for|ward, &s;o that it was doubted whether Parliament would ratify this
<PB N="301" REF="323">
agreement. Blake &s;aid, that if they had given Sir John Grenville good conditions, they had done it with good rea&s;on; that in the fir&s;t place, it &s;aved the effu&s;ion of Engli&s;h blood; and next, that there was a &s;trong &s;quadron of Dutch &s;hips at no great di&s;tance, the commander of which had offered Sir John no le&s;s than 100,000 pounds, to put the&s;e i&s;lands into his hands; that if the Parliament did not approve of his conduct, he &s;hould be &s;orry for it, and &s;hould take care to prevent a mi&s;take of that &s;ort in future, by laying down his commi&s;&s;ion, as he was confident Sir George Ay&s;cue would likewi&s;e do. Upon this there was no more &s;aid of the articles, which were honourably complied with, and Sir George received orders to &s;ail immediately to the We&s;t-Indies, which he obeyed, never expecting to hear any more of the&s;e articles, which, as they were made with good rea&s;on, &s;o he thought they would have met with a good reception; but he had afterwards cau&s;e given him to apprehend, that whatever benefit the Parliament might receive from the &s;ervice it&s;elf, they were far enough from being &s;atisfied with the man|ner in which it was done.</P>
<P>Sir George continued his voyage, without meeting with any cro&s;s accident, till his arrival at Barbadoes; which was on the 26th of Oc|tober, 1651. He then found his enterprize would be attended with great difficulties, and &s;uch as had not been fore&s;een at home. The Lord Willoughby, of Parham, commanded there for the King, and had a&s;&s;embled a body of five thou&s;and men for the defence of the i&s;land. He was a nobleman of great parts and great probity, one who had been extremely reverenced by the parliament before he quitted their party, and who&s;e worth had &s;o &s;trongly recommended him, both to the e&s;teem and affection of the inhabitants, that he had as ab&s;olute a di&s;po&s;al of their per&s;ons and properties, as it was nece&s;|&s;ary for a Governor to have, who was in &s;uch a &s;ituation; and the u&s;e he made of his power and influence, was as perfectly right in it&s;elf, as the critical circum&s;tances of tho&s;e times required. Sir George, though he fully apprehended how many and how great ob&s;tacles lay in his way, yet &s;hewed no &s;igns of concern, but boldly forced his pa&s;|&s;age into the harbour, and made him&s;elf matter of twelve &s;ail of Dutch merchantmen that lay there, hoping that this might rai&s;e an in&s;urrec|tion in the i&s;land, in which, however, he was mi&s;taken. The next morning he &s;ent a &s;ummons to the Lord Willoughby, requiring him to &s;ubmit to the authority of the Parliament of England; to which his Lord&s;hip an&s;wered, that he knew no &s;uch authority, that he had a commi&s;&s;ion from King Charles II. to be governor of that i&s;land, and that he would keep it for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice at the hazard of his life. That he might be able to make good his word, he put the i&s;land and its inhabitants into the be&s;t po&s;ture of defence po&s;&s;ible, and
<PB N="302" REF="324">
being much &s;uperior in &s;trength, Sir George thought it not prudent to land the few troops he had, and thereby di&s;cover his weakne&s;s to &s;o cautious an enemy. In the mean time, he received a letter by an advice-boat from England, with the news of the King's being de|feated at Worce&s;ter, with one intercepted from Lady Willoughby, containing a very particular account of that unhappy affair. Upon this he &s;ummoned Lord Willoughby a &s;econd time, and accompanied his &s;ummons with Lady Willoughby's letter, which, however, made no impre&s;&s;ion upon his Lord&s;hip, who continued firm in his re&s;olution, of holding out the i&s;land as long as he could. All this time, Sir George anchored in Speights bay, and &s;tayed there till December, when the Virginia Merchant fleet arriving, he re&s;olved to take that opportunity to land with the greater advantage; for he made as if they were a reinforcement that had been &s;ent him, and he had only waited for them till then; whereas, the truth was, he had not above two thou&s;and men, and the &s;ight of the little army on &s;hore, made him cautious of venturing his men, till he thought the inhabitants had con|ceived a greater idea of his &s;trength, than they had done before. The Virginia &s;hips were welcomed at their coming in, as a &s;upply of men of war, and he pre&s;ently ordered his men on &s;hore: 150 Scotch &s;ervants aboard that fleet, were added to a regiment of 700 men, and &s;ome &s;eamen, to make their number look more formidable. Sir George had on board his fleet one Colonel Allen, a gentleman of Bar|badoes, who came from thence into England, to &s;olicit from the Par|liament, a force &s;ufficient for the reduction of the i&s;land, and there|fore he was thought the propere&s;t man to command the forces on &s;hore. He accordingly landed with them on &s;eventeenth of Decem|ber, and found Lord Willoughby's torches well entrenched, near a fort which they had on the &s;ea-coa&s;t. They attacked him, however, and, in a &s;harp di&s;pute, wherein about &s;ixty men were killed on both &s;ides, had &s;o much the advantage, that they drove them to the fort, notwith&s;tanding that Colonel Allen, their commander, was killed by a muket &s;hot, as he attempted to land. The &s;oldiers and &s;eamen, however, pu&s;hed on, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the fort, and four pieces of cannon that were in it. After this, the &s;ailors returned to their &s;hips, which cruized up and down, to prevent any &s;uccours coming to the i&s;landers, or any merchants trading with them. The &s;oldiers po&s;ted them&s;elves in the fort, and from thence made incur|&s;ions into the country, upon which the chief of the inhabitants grew weary of the war; which Sir George under&s;tanding, by the corre&s;pon|dence he had in the i&s;land, he by the &s;ame means procured Colonel Moddiford, who was one of the mo&s;t leading men in the place, to
<PB N="303" REF="325">
enter into a treaty with him, and this negociation &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that Moddiford, declared publicly for a peace, and joined with Sir George to bring Lord Willoughby, the Governor, to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> as they phra&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Sir George's men were now all on &s;hore, and made up a body of two thou&s;and foot, and an hundred hor&s;e, for many de&s;erters had come over to him. If Colonel Moddiford had joined him with his party in attacking them, there was no hope of the Governor's e&s;caping, who having before de&s;erted the Parliament, could expect no mercy from them, if he was taken without a treaty. But perhaps all the&s;e con&s;ide|rations would &s;carcely have prevailed with that generous nobleman to have given up the i&s;land, if an accident had not happened, which put mo&s;t of the gentlemen about him into &s;uch confu&s;ion, that he could no longer depend upon their advice or a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The thing happened thus: his Lord&s;hip perceiving his &s;uperiority lay chiefly in his hor&s;e, re&s;olved to make a bri&s;k pu&s;h with the body under his immediate com|mand; and having, previous to the execution of his de&s;ign, called to|gether his officers; while they were &s;itting in council, a cannon-ball beat open the door of the room, and took off the head of the centinel po&s;ted before it, which &s;o frightened all the gentlemen of the i&s;land, that they not only compelled the Governor to lay a&s;ide his former de|&s;ign, but to retire to a place two miles farther from the harbour. Sir George Ay&s;cue, taking advantage of this unexpected good fortune, immediately ordered all his forces on &s;hore, which con&s;i&s;ted, as was &s;aid, of two thou&s;and foot, and one hundred hor&s;e, to advance under the command of Captain Morrice, as if he intended to have attacked them in their entrenchments, which &s;truck &s;uch a terror into &s;ome of the principal per&s;ons about the Governor, that after mature deliberation on his own circum&s;tances, and their di&s;po&s;ition, he began to alter his mind; and thereupon, to avoid the effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian and Engli&s;h blood, both parties appointed commi&s;&s;aries to treat. Sir George named Captain Peck, Mr. Searl, Colonel Thomas Moddiford, and James Colliton, E&s;q. the Lord Willoughby, Sir Richard Peers, Charles Pim, E&s;q. Colonel Ellice, and Major Byham, who on the &s;eventeenth of January agreed on articles of rendition, which were alike comprehen|&s;ive and honourable. The Lord Willoughby had what he mo&s;t de|&s;ired, indemnity and freedom of e&s;tate and per&s;on, upon which, &s;oon after, he returned to England. The i&s;lands of N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vis, Antig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a, and St. Chri&s;topher, were, by the &s;ame capitulation, &s;urrendered to the Parliament, with a provi&s;o, that Lord Willoughby, Colonel Walrond, and &s;ome other per&s;ons mentioned in that treaty, were re&s;tored to their e&s;tates, and the inhabitants were promi&s;ed, not only indemnity but Protection, in the quiet enjoyment of their plantations, upon condi|tion
<PB N="304" REF="326">
that they did nothing to the prejudice of the commonwealth. &mdash;This treaty being &s;igned, Mr. Searl was appointed Governor of Barbadoes, and Mr. Rynell of Antigua and the Leeward I&s;lands, in virtue of a commi&s;&s;ion, granted to Sir George Ay&s;cue, for this pur|po&s;e. The news of the reduction of the&s;e i&s;lands made &s;uch a noi&s;e in that part of the world, that Captain Dennis who was detached with a few &s;hips to Virginia, reduced it without much trouble; after which, Sir George con&s;idering that he had fully executed his commi&s;&s;ion, and that his pre&s;ence was no farther nece&s;&s;ary in America, re&s;olved to return with the &s;quadron under his command to England, which he accordingly did, and arriving at Plymouth on the twenty-fifth of May, 1652, was received with all imaginable te&s;timonies of joy and &s;ati&s;faction by the people there, to whom he was well known before, as his late &s;ucce&s;s al&s;o &s;erved not a little to rai&s;e and heighten his re|putation. It was not long after his arrival, before he found him&s;elf again obliged to enter upon action; for the Dutch war which broke out in his ab&s;ence, was then become extremely warm, and he was forced to take a &s;hare in it, though his &s;hips were &s;o extremely foul, that they were much fitter to be laid up, than to be employed in any farther &s;er|vice. On the twenty-fir&s;t of June, 1652, Sir George Ay&s;cue, in obe|dience to the orders he had received from London, came to Dover, with his eleven &s;ail, and there joined his old friend, Admiral Blake, on board who&s;e &s;hip he dined, and was received with all imaginable marks of re&s;pect and kindne&s;s, by that famous commander. In the beginning of the next month, Blake having received orders to &s;ail northward, and de&s;troy the Dutch herring fi&s;hery, Sir George Ay&s;cue was left to com|mand the fleet in the Downs. Within a few days after Blake's depar|ture, he took five &s;ail of Dutch merchantmen, and had &s;carcely brought them in, before he received advice, that a fleet of forty &s;ail had been &s;een not far from the coa&s;t, upon which he gave chace, fell in among&s;t them, took &s;even, &s;unk four, and ran twenty-four upon the French &s;hose, all the re&s;t being &s;eparated from their convoy, which, con&s;idering that Sir George had with him only the &s;quadron he brought from Barbadoes, was very gallantly performed, as Whitelock judiciou&s;ly informs us. In the account that Sir George gave of this action to the Parliament, he ob&s;erved, that running Dutch &s;hips upon the French &s;hore, was the &s;ame thing as &s;inking or burning them; for though the French defended them vigorou&s;ly from the Engli&s;h &s;hips that pur&s;ued them, yet they afterwards went aboard the Dutch, and plundered them without mercy. The Dutch Admiral, Van Tromp, who was at &s;ea with a great fleet, having information of the &s;ituation that Sir George Ay&s;cue was in, re&s;olved to take advantage of him, and with no le&s;s than one hundred &s;ail, clapped in between him and
<PB N="305" REF="327">
the river, and re&s;olved to &s;urpri&s;e &s;uch &s;hips as &s;hould attempt to go out; or, if that de&s;ign failed, to go in and &s;ink Sir George and his &s;quadron. The Engli&s;h Admiral &s;oon di&s;covered their intention, and, cau&s;ing a &s;ignal to be made from Dover ca&s;tle for all &s;hips to keep to &s;ea, he thereby defeated the fir&s;t part of their project. How|ever, Van Tromp attempted the &s;econd part of his &s;cheme, in hopes of better &s;ucce&s;s, and on the eighth of July, when it was ebb, he began to &s;ail towards the Engli&s;h Fleet; but the wind dying away, he was obliged to come to an anchor about a league off, in order to expect the next ebb. Sir George, in the mean time, cau&s;ed a &s;trong platform to be rai&s;ed between Deal and Sandown ca&s;tles, well fur|ni&s;hed with artillery, &s;o pointed, as to bear directly upon the Dutch as they came in. The militia of the county of Kent were al&s;o order|ed down to the &s;ea-&s;hore, to entertain the enemy with their &s;mall &s;hot; notwith&s;tanding which preparation, the Dutch Admiral did not recede from his point, but at the next ebb weighed anchor, and would have &s;tood into the port; but the wind coming about &s;outh-we&s;t, and blowing directly in his teeth, con&s;trained him to keep out, and, be|ing &s;treightened for time, he was obliged to &s;ail away, and leave Sir George &s;afe in the harbour, with the &s;mall &s;quadron he commanded. He was &s;oon after ordered to Plymouth, to bring in under his convoy five Ea&s;t-India &s;hips, which he did in the latter end of July; and in the fir&s;t week of Augu&s;t, brought in four French and Dutch prizes, for which activity and vigilance in his command, he was univer&s;ally commended. In a few days after this, intelligence was received, that Van Tromp's fleet was &s;een off the back of the I&s;le of Wight, and it was thereupon re&s;olved, that Sir George, with his fleet of for|ty men of war, mo&s;t of them hired merchantmen, except flag-&s;hips, &s;hould &s;tretch over to the coa&s;t of France to meet them. According|ly, on the &s;ixteenth of Augu&s;t, between one and two of the clock at noon, they got &s;ight of the enemy, who quitted their merchantmen, being fifty in number. About four the fight began; the Engli&s;h Ad|miral, with nine others, charging through their fleet; his &s;hips receiv|ed mo&s;t damage in the &s;hrouds, ma&s;ts, &s;ails, and rigging, which was repaid the Dutch in their hulls. Sir George having thus pa&s;&s;ed through them, got the weather-gage, and charged them again; but all his fleet not coming up, and the night already entered, they part|ed with a drawn battle. Captain Peck, the Rear-Admiral, lo&s;t his leg, of which, &s;oon after, he died. Several captains were wound|ed, but no &s;hip lo&s;t, only &s;ome &s;hattered and torn. Of the Dutch not one was &s;aid to be lo&s;t, though many were &s;hot through and through, but &s;o that they were able to proceed on their voyage,
<PB N="306" REF="328">
and anchored the next day after, being followed by the Engli&s;h to the i&s;le of Ba&s;&s;a; but no farther attempt was made by our fleet, by rea&s;on, as it was pretended, of the danger of the French coa&s;ts; from whence they returned to Plymouth-Sound, to mend and repair their rigging. The truth of the matter was, &s;ome of Sir George's Cap|tains were a little ba&s;hful in this affair, and the fleet was in &s;o in|different a condition, that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to refit, before they proceeded again to action. He proceeded next to join Blake in the Northern Seas, where he continued during the be&s;t part of the month of September, and took &s;everal prizes; and, towards the latter end of that month, Sir George returned with General Blake into the Downs, with one hundred and twenty &s;ail of men of war. On the twenty-&s;eventh of that month a great Dutch fleet appeared, after which Blake with his fleet &s;ailed, and Sir George Ay&s;cue, pur&s;uant to the orders he had received, returned to Chatham with his own &s;hip, and &s;ent the re&s;t of his &s;quadron into &s;everal ports to be careened. It does not appear that parliament openly expre&s;&s;ed any di&s;like, or di&s;ta&s;te, at Sir George's behaviour upon his coming home, but, on the contrary, &s;hewed him all the regard and re&s;pect imaginable, though he had &s;ome friends who informed him, that this was in ap|pearance only; &s;ince they could not help expre&s;&s;ing a di&s;like to the terms he had granted to Lord Willoughby at Barbadoes, which they con&s;idered as the &s;econd part of Sir John Grenville's bu&s;ne&s;s, for which they had been &s;o angry both with him and Blake. All this, however, Sir George bore without any vi&s;ible &s;igns of di&s;content, profe&s;&s;ing that he had done what he took to be his duty, and would continue to do &s;o, as long as he commanded in the Engli&s;h fleet, without troubling him&s;elf about the humours of particular men, whom, after all his endeavours, he might find it impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e. But, while the&s;e jealou&s;ies and heart-burnings &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on both &s;ides, an occa&s;ion offered which enabled all parties to &s;atisfy them&s;elves. It &s;o fell out, that towards the end of November, 1652, the famous Ge|neral Blake lying at the mouth of our river, began to think that the &s;ea&s;on of the year left no room to expect farther action, for which rea&s;on he detached twenty of his &s;hips to bring up a fleet of colliers from Newca&s;tle, twelve more he had &s;ent to Plymouth, and our Ad|miral, as is before ob&s;erved, with fifteen &s;ail, had proceeded up the river in order to their being careened. Such was the &s;ituation of things, when Van Tromp appeared with a fleet of eighty-five &s;ail. Upon this Blake &s;ent for the mo&s;t experienced officers on board his own &s;hip, where, after a long con&s;ultation, it was agreed, that he &s;hould wait for, and fight the enemy, though he had but thirty-&s;even
<PB N="307" REF="329">
&s;ail of men of war, and a few &s;mall &s;hips. Accordingly, on the twenty-ninth of November a general engagement en&s;ued, which la&s;t|ed with great fury from one in the afternoon till it was dark. Blake in the Triumph, with his &s;econds, the Victory and the Vanguard, engaged, for a con&s;iderable time, near twenty &s;ail of Dutch men of war, and they were in the utmo&s;t danger of being oppre&s;&s;ed and de|&s;troyed by &s;o unequal a force. This, however, did not hinder Blake forcing his way into a throng of enemies, to relieve the Garland and Bonadventure, in doing which he was attacked by many of their &s;toute&s;t &s;hips, which likewi&s;e boarded him; but after &s;everal times beat|ing them off, he at la&s;t found an opportunity to rejoin his fleet. The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the Engli&s;h con&s;i&s;ted in five &s;hips, either taken or &s;unk, and &s;everal others di&s;abled. The Dutch confe&s;s, that one of their men of war was burnt towards the latter end of the fight, and the Captain and mo&s;t of his men drowned, and al&s;o that the &s;hips of Tromp and Evert&s;on were much di&s;abled. At la&s;t, night having parted the two fleets, Blake &s;uppo&s;ing he had &s;ufficiently &s;ecured the nation's honour and his own, by waiting the attack of an enemy &s;o much &s;uperior, and &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of advantage by renewing the fight, retired up the river; but Sir George Ay&s;cue, who inclined to the bolder, but le&s;s prudent coun&s;el, was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted at this re|treat, that he laid down his commi&s;&s;ion. The &s;ervices this great man had rendered to his country, were none of them more acceptable to the Parliament than this act of laying down his command. They had long wi&s;hed, and waited, for an opportunity of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him from their &s;ervice, and were therefore extremely plea&s;ed that he had &s;aved them this trouble: however, to &s;hew their gratitude for pa&s;t &s;ervices, and to prevent his falling into ab&s;olute di&s;content, they vo|ted him a pre&s;ent of three hundred pounds in money, and likewi&s;e be&s;towed upon him three hundred pounds <HI>per annum</HI> in Ireland. There is good rea&s;on to believe, that Cromwell and his faction were a well plea&s;ed with this gentleman's quitting the &s;ea-&s;ervice: for, as they were then meditating, what they &s;oon afterwards put in execu|tion, the turning the parliament out of doors, it could not but be agreeable to them, to &s;ee an officer who had &s;o great credit in the na|vy, and who was &s;o generally e&s;teemed by the nation, laid a&s;ide in &s;uch a manner, both as it gave them an opportunity of in&s;inuating the ingratitude of that a&s;&s;embly to &s;o worthy a per&s;on, and as it freed them from the apprehen&s;ion of his di&s;turbing their mea&s;ures, in ca&s;e he had continued in the fleet; which is highly probable might have come to pa&s;s, considering that Blake was far enough from being of their party, and only &s;ubmitted to &s;erve the Protector, becau&s;e he
<PB N="308" REF="330">
&s;aw no other way left to &s;erve his country, and did not think he had in|tere&s;t &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the fleet, after the defection of the army, which perhaps might have been the ca&s;e, if Sir George Ay&s;cue had continued in his command. This is &s;o much the more probable, as it is very certain he never entered into the Protector's &s;ervice, or &s;hewed him&s;elf at all willing to concur in his mea&s;ures; though there is no doubt that Cromwell would have been extremely glad of &s;o ex|perienced an officer in his Spani&s;h war. He retired after this to his country &s;eat in the county of Surrey, and lived there in great honour and &s;plendour, vi&s;iting, and being vi&s;ited, by per&s;ons of the greate&s;t di&s;tinction, both natives and foreigners, and pa&s;&s;ing in the general opi|nion of both, for one of the able&s;t &s;ea-captains of that age. Yet there is &s;ome rea&s;on to believe that he had a particular corre&s;pondence with the Protector's &s;econd &s;on, Henry; &s;ince there is &s;till a letter in be|ing from him to Secretary Thurloe, which &s;hews that he had very ju&s;t notions of the worth of this gentleman, and of the expediency of con&s;ulting him in all &s;uch matters as had a relation to maritime power. The Protector, towards the latter end of his life, began to grow di&s;&s;atisfied with the Dutch, the rather, becau&s;e of the &s;hare they had taken in the affairs of the North, where they had e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the King of Denmark to a degree of partiality, and were projecting the total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Swedi&s;h power. This did not by any means agree with the Protector's plan in regard to fo|reign affairs, and as it was not in his nature to bear with any di&s;ap|pointment in his views, &s;o he re&s;olved to de&s;troy this &s;y&s;tem of the Dutch, and yet without entering immediately into a war with them. It was with this view, that he encouraged the Swedes to cultivate, with the utmo&s;t diligence, a maritime force, promi&s;ing in due time to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with a &s;ufficient number of able and experienced officers, and with an Admiral to command them, who, in point of reputa|tion, was not inferior to any then living. It was upon this occa&s;ion, and for this &s;ervice, that he ca&s;t his eyes upon Sir George Ay&s;cue; but not caring to deal directly with a man who had declined acting under his government, and had never frequented his court, he re|&s;olved that the propo&s;ition &s;hould be made him by the Swedi&s;h Am|ba&s;&s;ador, and &s;ent the Lord Keeper, Whitelock, to introduce him to the Admiral, at his country-&s;eat. This interview had its effect: Sir George Ay&s;cue from that time began to entertain favourable thoughts of the de&s;ign, and brought him&s;elf by degrees to approve of the pro|po&s;ition that was made to him, &s;o far as to think, at lea&s;t, not only of quitting the retreat he had cho&s;en, but even of accepting the offer made him, and of going over for that purpo&s;e to Sweden. But as
<PB N="309" REF="331">
great undertakings move &s;lowly, and there is much time nece&s;&s;ary for ripening &s;uch va&s;t projects into execution; &s;o we find that Sir George Ay&s;cue had not brought him&s;elf to an ab&s;olute compliance in refe|rence to this de&s;ign, before the death of the Protector. Yet that did not hinder his clo&s;ing at la&s;t with the propo&s;als made him from Swe|den, and putting every thing in order for his journey, towards the latter end of the year 1658. But as &s;uch a de&s;ign as this was could not be put in execution without making &s;ome &s;tir, and thereby rai|&s;ing public di&s;cour&s;e about it; &s;o this had &s;uch an effect upon the Da|ni&s;h mini&s;ter then re&s;iding here, that he could not forbear writing to Mr. Secretary Thurloe, in pretty &s;trong terms upon the occa&s;ion, in&s;inuating, at the &s;ame time, &s;ome general reflections on the cha|racter of Sr George Ay&s;cue. This, however, had no effect, either in procuring an interpo&s;ition from the State to prevent Sir George from pro&s;ecuting his de&s;ign, or in obliging him to alter his re&s;olu|tion. On the contrary, as &s;oon as he had &s;een the officers embarked, and had di&s;patched &s;ome private bu&s;ine&s;s of his own, he pro&s;ecuted his voyage, though in the very depth of winter. This expo&s;ed him to great hard&s;hips, which, however, he endured with much con|&s;tancy; and, on his arrival in Sweden, he was received with all imaginable demon&s;trations of civility and re&s;pect by the King, who was extremely well plea&s;ed with his coming, and might very probably have made good his promi&s;e, of promoting him to the rank of High-Admiral of Sweden, if he had not been taken off by an unexpected death. This put an end to his hopes in that country, and di&s;po&s;ed Sir George Ay&s;cue to return home, where a great change had been working in his ab&s;ence, which was that of re&s;toring King Charles II. It does not at all appear, that Sir George had any concern in this great affair; but the contrary may be rather pre&s;umed, from his former attachment to parliament, and his making it his choice to have remained in Sweden, if the death of the Monarch, who invited him thither, had not prevented him. On his return, however, he not only &s;ubmitted to the government then e&s;tabli&s;hed, but gave the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances to the admini&s;tration, that he &s;hould be at all times ready to &s;erve the Public, if ever there &s;hould be occa&s;ion; which was very kindly taken, and Sir George Ay&s;cue had the honour to be introduced to his Maje&s;ty, and to ki&s;s his hand. It was not long before he was called to the performance of his promi&s;e; for the Dutch war breaking out in 1664, he was immediately put into com|mi&s;&s;ion by the direction of the Duke of York, who then commanded the Engli&s;h fleet. In the &s;pring of the year 1665, Sir George Ay&s;|cue hoi&s;ted his flag as Rear-Admiral of the Blue, under the Right
<PB N="310" REF="332">
Honourable the Earl of Sandwich, and in the great battle that was fought the third of June in the &s;ame year, that &s;quadron had the ho|nour to break through the Dutch fleet, and thereby made way for one of the mo&s;t glorious victories ever obtained by this nation at &s;ea: For, in this battle, the Dutch had ten of their large&s;t &s;hips &s;unk or burned, be&s;ides their Admiral Opdam's, which blew up in the mid&s;t of the engagement, by which the Admiral him&s;elf, and up|wards of five hundred men peri&s;hed. Eighteen men of war were ta|ken, four fire-&s;hips de&s;troyed, thirteen Captains, and two thou&s;and and fifty private men, made pri&s;oners; and this with &s;o incon&s;idera|ble a lo&s;s, as that of one &s;hip only, and three hundred private men. As there was &s;ome time requi&s;ite for refitting and repairing the Eng|li&s;h navy, after &s;o warm an action, the Duke of York, who com|manded the fleet in that engagement, returned to London; but not till the king had vi&s;ited the navy, where, going on board the Royal Charles, at the Buoy of the Nore, he knighted &s;everal of the offi|cers who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the late battle, and made a grand naval promotion. The fleet being again in a condition to put to &s;ea, was ordered to rendezvous at Southwold-Bay, from whence, to the number of &s;ixty &s;ail, they weighed on the fifth of July, and flood over to the coa&s;t of Holland. The &s;tandard was borne by the gallant Earl of Sandwich, to whom was Vice-Admiral Sir George Ay&s;cue, and Sir Thomas Tyddiman Rear-Admiral; Sir William Penn was Admiral of the White, Sir William Berkley Vice-Admiral, and Sir Jo&s;eph Jordan Rear-Admiral. The Blue flag was carried by Sir Thomas Allen, who&s;e Vice and Rear, were Sir Chri&s;topher Mimms, and Sir John Harman. The de&s;ign they went on was, to intercept de Ruyter in his return, or, at lea&s;t, to take and burn the Turkey and Ea&s;t-India fleets, of which they had certain intelligence. They &s;ucceeded in neither of the&s;e &s;chemes; de Ruyter returned un|expectedly by the north of Scotland, and arrived &s;afely in Holland, where he was immediate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y promoted to the chief command of the fleet. The Turkey and India fleets, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty &s;ail, under the command of Commodore Bitter, cho&s;e to take the &s;ame northern route, in hopes of avoiding the Engli&s;h navy; but having intelli|gence at &s;ea, that this would prove very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, they took &s;helter in the port of Bergen in Norway. The Earl of Sandwich having detached Sir Thomas Tyddiman to attack them there, returned home, and had the good luck to take eight Dutch men of war, which &s;erved as convoys to their Ea&s;t and We&s;t India fleets, and &s;everal merchantmen richly laden, which fini&s;hed the triumph of that year. The plain &s;uperiority of the Engli&s;h over the
<PB N="311" REF="333">
Dutch at &s;ea, engaged the French, in order to keep up the war be|tween the maritime powers, and make them do their bu&s;ine&s;s by de|&s;troying each other, to declare on the &s;ide of the weake&s;t, as did the King of Denmark al&s;o, which, neverthele&s;s, had no effect upon the Engli&s;h, who determined to carry on the war again&s;t the allies, with the &s;ame &s;pirit they had done again&s;t the Dutch alone. In the &s;pring, therefore, of the year 1666, the fleet was very early at &s;ea, under the command of the joint Admirals; for a re&s;olution having been taken at Court, not to expo&s;e the per&s;on of the Duke of York any more, and the Earl of Sandwich being then in Spain, in the cha|racter of Amba&s;&s;ador-Extraordinary, Prince Rupert, and old Ge|neral Monk, now duke of Albermarle, were appointed to command the fleet; having under them as gallant and prudent officers as ever di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the Engli&s;h navy, and, among&s;t the&s;e, Sir William Berkley commanded the Blue, and Sir George Ay&s;cue the White &s;quadron. Prince Rupert, and the Duke of Albemarle, went on board the fleet the twenty-third of April, 1666, and &s;ailed in the beginning of May. Towards the latter end of that month, the Court was informed, that the French fleet, under the command of the Duke of Beaufort, were coming out to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Dutch. This rumour of their joining the Dutch was &s;pread by France, in or|der to deceive us, and di&s;tre&s;s the Dutch; them&s;elves, in reality, having no &s;uch intention. Upon the receiving this news, the Court &s;ent orders to Prince Rupert to &s;ail with the White &s;quadron, the Ad|mirals excepted, to look out and fight the French; which command that brave prince obeyed; but found it what many wi&s;e people thought, a mere groundle&s;s bravado, intended to rai&s;e the courage of their new allies, and thereby bring them into the greater danger. At the &s;ame time Prince Rupert &s;ailed from the Downs, the Dutch put out to &s;ea, the wind at north-ea&s;t, and a fre&s;h gale. This brought the Dutch fleet on the coa&s;t of Dunkirk, and carried his highne&s;s to|wards the I&s;le of Wight; but the wind &s;uddenly &s;hifting to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and blowing hard, brought the Dutch and the Duke to an an|chor. Captain Bacon, in the Bri&s;tol, fir&s;t di&s;covered the enemy, and, by firing his guns, gave notice of it to the Engli&s;h fleet. Upon this a council of war was called, wherein it was re&s;olved to fight the enemy, notwith&s;tanding their great &s;uperiority. After the de|parture of prince Rupert, the Duke had with him only the Red and Blue &s;quadrons, making about &s;ixty &s;ail, whereas the Dutch fleet con&s;i&s;ted of ninety-one men of war, carrying 4716 guns, and 22,460 men. It was the fir&s;t of June when they were di&s;cerned, and the Duke was &s;o warm for engaging, that he attacked the enemy before
<PB N="312" REF="334">
they had time to weigh anchor, and, as de Ruyter him&s;elf &s;ays in his letter, they were obliged to cut their cables; and in the &s;ame letter he owns, that to the la&s;t the Engli&s;h were the aggre&s;&s;ors, notwith|&s;tanding their inferiority and other di&s;advantages. This day's fight was very fierce and bloody; for the Dutch, confiding in their num|bers, pre&s;&s;ed furiou&s;ly upon the Engli&s;h fleet, while the Engli&s;h offi|cers, being men of determined re&s;olution, fought with &s;uch courage and con&s;tancy, that they not only repul&s;ed the Dutch, but renewed the attack, and forced the enemy to maintain the fight longer than they were inclined to do, &s;o that it was ten in the evening before their cannon were &s;ilent. The following night was &s;pent in repair|ing the damages &s;uffered on both &s;ides, and next morning the fight was renewed by the Engli&s;h with fre&s;h vigour. Admiral Van Tromp, with Vice-Admiral Vander Hul&s;t, being on board one &s;hip, ra&s;hly engaged among the Engli&s;h, and were in the utmo&s;t danger, either of being taken or burnt. The Dutch affairs, according to their own ac|count, were now in a de&s;perate condition; but Admiral de Ruyter at la&s;t di&s;engaged them, though not till his &s;hip was di&s;abled, and Vice-Admiral Vander Hul&s;t killed. This only changed the &s;cene; for de Ruyter was now as hard pu&s;hed as Van Tromp had been before; however, a reinforcement arriving, pre&s;erved him al&s;o, and &s;o the &s;econd day's fight ended earlier than the fir&s;t. The Duke, finding that the Dutch had received a reinforcement, and that his &s;mall fleet, on the contrary, was much weakened, through the damages &s;u&s;tain|ed by &s;ome, and the lo&s;s and ab&s;ence of others of his &s;hips, took, to|wards the evening, the re&s;olution to retire, and endeavour to join Prince Rupert, who was coming to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The retreat was performed in good order, twenty-&s;ix or twenty-eight men of war who had &s;uffered lea&s;t, brought up the rear, interpo&s;ing between the enemy and the di&s;abled &s;hips, three of which, being ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y much &s;hat|tered, were burnt by the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, and the men taken on board the other &s;hips. The Dutch fleet followed, but at a di&s;tance. As they thus &s;ailed on, it happened on the the third day that Sir George Ay&s;cue, Admiral of the White, who commanded the Royal Prince (being the large&s;t and heavie&s;t &s;hip of the whole fleet) unfor|tunately &s;truck upon the &s;and called the Galloper, where, being threat|ened by the enemy's fire-&s;hips, and hopele&s;s of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his friends (who&s;e timely return, the near approach of the enemy, and the tide, had ab&s;olutely rendered impo&s;&s;ible), he was forced to &s;ur|render. This was that famous engagement, which did equal ho|nour to both the maritime powers, and in which both their officers and &s;eamen are allowed to have performed as great things as
<PB N="313" REF="335">
were ever attempted on the watery element. Yet our hi&s;torians have given very imperfect accounts of it, even tho&s;e who ought to have made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to be more particularly acquainted with this tran&s;action; &s;o that, if we would learn any particulars relating to it, we mu&s;t look for them in the works of &s;trangers, and even of ene|mies, who, in this re&s;pect, have been both ju&s;ter and kinder than the authors either of our general or naval hi&s;tories. The Dutch Admi|ral, de Ruyter, in his letter to the States-General, &s;ays, in few words, That Sir George Ay&s;cue, Admiral of the White, having run upon a &s;and bank, fell into their hands, and that after taking out the commanders and men that were left, they &s;et the &s;hip on fire. But the large relation, collected by order of the States, out of all the letters written to them upon that occa&s;ion, informs us, That Sir George Ay&s;cue, in the Royal Prince, ran upon the Galloper, an unhappy accident, &s;ays that relation, for an officer who had behaved very gallantly gallantly during the whole engagement, and who only retired in obedience to the admiral's orders. The unfortunate Admi|ral made &s;ignals for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the Engli&s;h fleet continued their route; &s;o that he was left quite alone, and without hope of &s;uccour; in which &s;ituation he was attacked by two Dutch fire-&s;hips, by which, without doubt, he had been burnt, if Lieutenant-Admiral Tromp, who was on board the &s;hip of Rear Admiral Sweers, had not made a &s;ignal to call off the fire-&s;hips, perceiving that his flag was already &s;truck, and a &s;ignal made for quarter; upon which Rear-Admiral Sweers, by order of Tromp, went on board the Engli&s;h &s;hip, and brought off Sir George Ay&s;cue, his officers, and &s;ome of his men, on board his own ve&s;&s;el, and the next morning Sir George was &s;ent to the Dutch coa&s;t, in order to go to the Hague in a galliot, by order of General de Ruyter. The Engli&s;h &s;hip was afterwards got off the &s;ands, notwith&s;tanding which, General de Ruyter ordered the re&s;t of the crew to be taken out, and the ve&s;&s;el &s;et on fire, that his fleet might be the le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed; which was accordingly done. But in tie French relation, publi&s;hed by order of court, we have another circum&s;tance which the Dutch have thought fit to omit, and it is this, That the crew gave up the &s;hip again&s;t the Admiral's will, who had given orders for &s;etting her on fire. There were &s;ome circum|&s;tances which made the lo&s;s of this &s;hip, in this manner, very di&s;a|greeable to the Engli&s;h court, and perhaps this may be the rea&s;on that &s;o little is &s;aid of it in our own relations. In all probability, Ge|neral de Ruyter took this opportunity of &s;ending Sir George Ay&s;cue to the Dutch coa&s;t the next morning, from an apprehen&s;ion that he might be retaken in the next day's fight. On his arrival at the
<PB N="314" REF="336">
Hague, he was very civilly treated; but to rai&s;e the &s;pirits of their people, and to make the mo&s;t of this dubious kind of victory, the States ordered Sir George to be carried, as it were in triumph, through the &s;everal towns of Holland, and then confined him in the ca&s;tle of Louve&s;tein, &s;o famous in the Dutch hi&s;tories for having been the pri|&s;on of &s;ome of their mo&s;t eminent patriots, and from whence the party, that oppo&s;ed the Prince of Orange, were &s;tyled the Louve&s;tein faction. As &s;oon as Sir George Ay&s;cue came to this ca&s;tle, he wrote a letter to king Charles II. to acquaint him with the condition he was in. How long he remained there, or whether he continued a pri&s;oner to the end of the war, is what we cannot determine from any lights that we have been able to procure; but it is &s;aid that he afterwards re|turned to England, and &s;pent the remainder of his days in peace. It is a thing greatly to be regretted, that &s;o little care has been taken, to do ju&s;tice to the memories of &s;o many great men as have &s;erved this nation, &s;ome at the expence of their lives, and others of their li|berties. Their virtues &s;urely de&s;erve a better reward, and it is to be hoped, that the pains we have taken in this collection, will render the doing ju&s;tice to &s;uch great and good men, &s;o vi&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;ucceding generations will have no rea&s;on to make this com|plaint.</P>
<P>It is with a view to this, that even where we cannot render our memoirs of &s;uch illu&s;trious per&s;ons &s;o complete as we could wi&s;h, we labour with the utmo&s;t diligence to make them as perfect as we can, which ob&s;ervation will be &s;ufficient to excu&s;e us to our readers, for concluding this article &s;omewhat abruptly, &s;ince it is done merely through want of materials, and not of inclination.</P>
<P>AYSSERIUS, or ASSERIUS (MENEVENSIS), by &s;ome called ASSER, by others ASKER, a learned Monk of St. David's, con|cerning whom, though much has been &s;aid, yet we find very little has been written with certainty, rather, as we apprehend, for want of considering the matter thoroughly, than from any want of mate|rials, or from any real ob&s;curity in which his &s;tory is involved. We &s;hall, therefore, give as clear and di&s;tinct an account of him as may be, and remove mo&s;t of the difficulties which have been hitherto thought too ob&s;cure in his hi&s;tory. He was of Bri|ti&s;h extraction, probably of that part of South Wales called Pembroke&s;hire, and was bred up in the learning of tho&s;e times, in the Mona&s;tery of St. David's (in Latin Menevia), whence he derived hit &s;urname of Meneven&s;is. There he is &s;aid to have had
<PB N="315" REF="337">
for his tutor Johannes Patricius, one of the mo&s;t celebrated &s;cholars of his age. Here he had al&s;o the countenance of Nobis, or Novis, Archbi&s;hop of that &s;ee, who was al&s;o his relation; but it does not ap|pear that he was either his Secretary or his Chancellor, as &s;ome wri|ters would have us believe. From St. David's he was invited to the Court of Aelfred the Great, merely from the reputation of his learn|ing. This &s;eems to have been about the year 880, or &s;omewhat ear|lier. Tho&s;e who had the charge of bringing him to Court, conduct|ed him from St. David's to the town of Dene (Dean) in Wilt&s;hire, where the King then was. He received him with great civility, and &s;hewed him in a little time the &s;tronge&s;t marks of favour and affection, in&s;omuch that he conde&s;cended to per&s;uade him not to think any more of returning to St. David's, but rather to continue with him as his Dome&s;tic Chaplain and a&s;&s;i&s;tant in his &s;tudies. A&s;&s;erius, howe|ver, mode&s;tly declined this propo&s;al, alleging, that it did not be|come him to de&s;ert that holy place where he had been educated, and received the order of Prie&s;thood, for the &s;ake of any preferment he could meet with el&s;ewhere. King Aelfred then de&s;ired, that he would divide his time between the Court and the Mona&s;tery, that is to &s;ay, that he would &s;pend &s;ix months at Court, and &s;ix at St. David's. A&s;|&s;erius would not lightly comply even with this reque&s;t, but de&s;ired the King's leave to return to St. David's, to a&s;k the advice of his bre|thren, which he obtained; but in his journey falling ill at Winche&s;ter of a fever, he lay there &s;ick twelve months and a week, till the king, wondering at his long &s;tay, wrote him letters, requiring his return to Court. But it &s;eems he was too weak to ride, of which when King Aelfred was informed by his letter, he de&s;i&s;ted from his reque&s;t. As &s;oon as he recovered, A&s;&s;erius made a journey to St. David's, where, con&s;ulting with his brethren on the King's propo&s;al, they unanimou&s;ly agreed that he &s;hould accept it, promi&s;ing them&s;elves great advanta|ges from his favour with the King, of which, at that time, it &s;eems they had great need; one Hemeid, a petty Prince of South Wales, making them exceedingly unea&s;y, and &s;ometimes compelling their Archbi&s;hop to quit the place of his re&s;idence. But, at the &s;ame time, they reque&s;ted of A&s;&s;erius, that he would prevail on the King to al|low him to re&s;ide quarterly at Court and at St. Davids', rather than that he &s;hould remain ab&s;ent &s;ix months at a time. When he came back he found the King at Leoneforde, who received him with great marks of di&s;tinction. He remained with him then eight months at once, reading and explaining to him whatever books were in his li|brary, whereby he grew into &s;o great credit with that generous
<PB N="316" REF="338">
Prince, that on Chri&s;tmas-eve following, he gave him the mona&s;te|ries of Amgre&s;byri, and Banuwille, that is, Ambro&s;bury in Wilt|&s;hire, and Banwell in Somer&s;et&s;hire, with a &s;ilk pall of great value, and as much incen&s;e as a man could carry, &s;ending together with them this compliment, <HI>That the&s;e were but &s;mall things, and by way of earne&s;t of better that &s;hould follow them.</HI> And, indeed, &s;oon after, A&s;&s;erius tells us, he had Exeter be&s;towed upon him, and not long after that, the bi&s;hopric of Sherburn, which, however, he &s;eems to have quitted in 883, though he always retained the title, as Wilfred Archbi&s;hop of York was con&s;tantly &s;o &s;tyled, though he accepted of another bi&s;hopric. Thenceforward he con&s;tantly attended the Court, in the manner before &s;tipulated, and is named as a per&s;on, in whom he had a particular confidence, by King Aelfred in his Te&s;ta|ment, which mu&s;t have been written &s;ome time before the year 885; &s;ince mention is made therein of E&s;na, bi&s;hop of Hereford, who died that year. He is al&s;o mentioned by the King, in his prefatory epi&s;tle placed before his tran&s;lation of Gregory's Pa&s;toral, addre&s;&s;ed to Wulf|fig, bi&s;hop of London; and therein the King does not call him bi&s;hop of Sherburn, but my bi&s;hop, acknowledging the help received from him and others in that tran&s;lation. For, as we learn, both from the King and from A&s;&s;erius him&s;elf, the method u&s;ed by that Prince, in tran&s;lating, was this: he had the &s;en&s;e of his author given him by one or other of the many learned men he had about him, and then he dige&s;t|ed it into an ea&s;y flowing &s;tyle (in which he had a peculiar excellency,) that men might thereby be invited to reading; for Aelfred did not tran&s;late as an author, to get reputation, but as a Prince, to promote the public good; neither did he de&s;ign that the books which he pub|li&s;hed &s;hould pa&s;s for exact tran&s;lations, but for good and u&s;eful trea|ti&s;es, from which &s;uch as under&s;tood none but their mother tongue, might reap profit and in&s;truction. It &s;eems to have been the near re|&s;emblance, which the genius of A&s;&s;erius bore to that of the King, which gained him &s;o great a &s;hare in his confidence; and very proba|bly it was on this account, that A&s;&s;erius drew up tho&s;e memoirs o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the life of Aelfred which we &s;till have, and which he dedicated and pre&s;ented to the King in 893. In which work we have a very re|markable account of the manner wherein that Prince and our autho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pent their time together. A&s;&s;erius tells us, that having one day being the fea&s;t of St. Martin, cited in conver&s;ation a pa&s;&s;age of &s;om<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> famous author, the King was mightily plea&s;ed therewith, and woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have him write it down in the margin of a book he carried in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> brea&s;t; but A&s;&s;erius, finding no room to write any &s;uch thing there and yet being de&s;irous to gratify his ma&s;ter, he a&s;ked King Aelfred

whether he &s;hould not provide a few leaves, in which to &s;et down &s;uch remarkable things, as occurred either in reading or con|ver&s;ation: the King was extremely plea&s;ed with this hint, and di|rected A&s;&s;erius to put it immediately into execution, which he accord|ingly did. Pur&s;uing this method con&s;tantly, their collection began to &s;well, till at length it became of the &s;ize of an ordinary <HI>P&s;alter</HI>; and this was what the King called his <HI>Hand-book</HI> or <HI>Manual.</HI> A&s;&s;e|rius, however, calls it Enchiridion. In all probability A&s;&s;erius con|tinued at court during the whole reign of Aelfred, and, for aught we know, &s;everal years after: but where, or when he died, was matter of di&s;pute, though the Saxon Chronicle po&s;itively fixes it to the year 910, to which, we think, no ju&s;t objection can be made. The reader will ob&s;erve, that we take A&s;&s;er the Monk, and A&s;&s;er bi&s;hop of Sher|burn, for one and the &s;ame per&s;on, which &s;ome, however, have de|nied: yet we go farther &s;till, and a&s;&s;ert him to have been al&s;o Arch|bi&s;hop of St. David's. We do indeed admit, that if there was &s;uch a reader in the public &s;chools at Oxford as A&s;&s;er the Monk, he mu&s;t have been &s;ome other per&s;on of the &s;ame name, and not our au|thor: but we do not think this point &s;o clearly made out, as to de&s;erve much di&s;pute about it, &s;ince it re&s;ts almo&s;t wholly on the au|thority of Harpsfield; for, though he cites the Annals of Winche&s;ter, yet we find no &s;uch thing in the annals that we have, nor is the ac|count con&s;istent with it&s;elf in &s;everal other re&s;pects be&s;ides this of A&s;|&s;er, as Sir John Spelman has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved. There is no le&s;s con|trover&s;y about the works of A&s;&s;erius, than about his preferments: for &s;ome allege that he never wrote any thing but the Annals of King Aelfred; whereas, Pits gives us the idea of no le&s;s than five other books of his writing, and adds, that he wrote many more. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is a <HI>Commentary on Bo&euml;tius,</HI> which is mentioned by Leland, on the authority of the Chronicle of St. Neot's: the truth is, he explained this author to King Aelfred when he made his Saxon tran|&s;lation, whence the cen&s;ure pa&s;&s;ed upon it, that though it was a work of great u&s;e in tho&s;e times, yet it was, in a manner, ridiculous in in ours: the &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of any literal ver&s;ion. The &s;e|cond thing mentioned by Pits, is the annals of Aelfred's life and reign. The third he &s;tyles <HI>Annales Britanniae,</HI> or the <HI>Annals of Bri|tain,</HI> in one book, mentioned al&s;o by Leland and Bale, and which hath been &s;ince publi&s;hed by the learned Dr. Gale, who inclined to think it genuine, which is certainly more than it de&s;erved. The fourth piece, he calls <HI>Aurearum Sententiarum Enchiridion, lib.</HI> 1. id e&s;t, <HI>An Enchiridion of Golden Sayings, in one Book,</HI> which is without que&s;|tion
<PB N="318" REF="340">
the <HI>Manual</HI> or <HI>Common-Place-Book</HI> made for King Aelfred, and reckoned among his works by this very Pits: It mu&s;t be owned that Leland had al&s;o &s;poken of this Enchiridion, but more accurately, and in a manner becoming &s;o great a writer; for he &s;peaks of it as an in|&s;tance of the learning and diligence of A&s;&s;er, which it certainly was: and though the collections he made concerning this author, are much better and larger than tho&s;e of Bale and Pits, yet he mode&s;tly, upon this &s;ubject, apologizes for &s;peaking &s;o little and &s;o ob&s;curely of &s;o great a man. The next in Pits' catalogue, is a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Homilies,</HI> and the la&s;t, a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Epi&s;tles:</HI> he took it for granted, that A&s;&s;er being a bi&s;hop, preached &s;ometimes, and that having &s;o many friends, he mu&s;t needs write letters, which is all the foundation that can be in nature for the&s;e two volumes, no ancient author &s;aying a word of them. Of the like &s;tamp is Bi&s;hop Godwin's account, of his being buried in his cathedral church of Sherburn, which is mere gue&s;s-work, founded on his being bi&s;hop there; and, with equal probabili|ty, we might &s;ay he was buried at St. Davids, though there is not any authority for either. Thus we conclude the article of this mo&s;t excellent per&s;on, who was, without que&s;tion, one of the mo&s;t pious, mo&s;t learned, and, withal, one of the mo&s;t mode&s;t Prelates of the age in which he lived.</P>
<P>ASSHETON (William) doctor of divinity, was the &s;on of Mr. As&s;heton, rector of Middleton in Lanca&s;hire, and de&s;cended of the ancient family of the baronets of his name in that county. He was born in the year 1641, and being in&s;tructed in grammar-learning at a private country-&s;chool, was removed to Brazen No&s;e college at Oxford, July 3, 1658: and elected a fellow of his college in 1663. After taking both his degrees in arts, he went into orders, became chaplain to the duke of Ormond, chancellor of that univer&s;ity; and was admitted doctor in divinity in January, 1673. In the following month he was nominated to the prebend of Knare&s;burgh, in the church of York; and whil&s;t he attended his patron in London, obtained the living of St Antholin. In 1676, by the duke's intere&s;t with the fa|mily of St. John's, he was pre&s;ented to the rectory of Beckenham, in Kent; and was often unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en proctor for Roche&s;ter in con|vocation.</P>
<P>He was the projector of a &s;cheme for providing a maintenance for clergymen's widows and others, by a jointure payable by the Mercers' Company. The bringing this project to perfection, took up his thoughts for many years; for, though encouraged by many judicious per&s;ons to pro&s;ecute it, he found much dif|culty
<PB N="319" REF="341">
in providing &s;uch a fund as might be a proper &s;ecurity to the &s;ub&s;cribers. He fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Corporation of the clergy, who declared they were not in a capacity to accept the propo&s;al. Meettng with no better &s;ucce&s;s in his next application to the Royal Bank of England, the doctor applied him&s;elf to the Mercers Compa|ny, who agreed with him upon certain rules and orders, of which the following are the chief; That the company will not take in &s;ub|&s;criptions beyond the &s;um of one hundred thou&s;and pounds; that all married men of the age of thirty, or under, may &s;ub&s;cribe any &s;um not exceeding one thou&s;and pounds; that all married men not exceed|ing the age of forty, may &s;ub&s;cribe any &s;um not exceeding five hun|dred pounds; and that all married men not exceeding the age of &s;ixty years, may &s;ub&s;cribe any &s;um not exceeding three hundred pounds; and that the widows of all per&s;ons &s;ub&s;cribing according to the&s;e limi|tations, &s;hall receive the benefit of thirty pounds per cent. per ann. free of all taxes and charges, at the two u&s;ual fea&s;ts of Lady-day and Michaelmas; and that the fir&s;t of the&s;e payments &s;hall be made at the fir&s;t of the &s;aid fea&s;t-days, which &s;hall happen four months or more after the decea&s;e of the &s;ub&s;criber; excepting &s;uch as voluntarily make away with them&s;elves, or by any act of their's occa&s;ion their own death, either by duelling or committing any other crime: in any or either of tho&s;e ca&s;es, the widow receives no annuity; but upon deli|vering up the company's bond, to have the &s;ub&s;cription-money re|turned to them: That no &s;ea-faring man may &s;ub&s;cribe; nor others, that go farther than Holland, Ireland, or the coa&s;ts of England; and that any per&s;on may &s;ub&s;cribe for others, whom he &s;hall nominate in his la&s;t will, during the natural life of his wife, if &s;he &s;urvive, and his intention to be declared in his &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>Dr. As&s;heton wrote &s;everal pieces again&s;t the papi&s;ts and di&s;&s;enters, and &s;ome practical and devotional tracts. A few years before his death, he was offered the head&s;hip of his college, which he declined. He died at Beckenham, in 1711, in the &s;eventieth year of his age. To give his character, as drawn by the writer of his life, "He was very regular and a&s;&s;iduous in private devotion, meditation, and read|ing . . . . Hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy, he ju&s;tly u&s;ed as the proper hand|maids to divinity, which was his bu&s;ine&s;s and delight . . . . He rea|dily &s;ub&s;cribed to all critical, learned and laborious works, by which means he completed one of the be&s;t libraries any clergyman can de|&s;ire, laying out at lea&s;t ten pounds per annum to improve and increa&s;e his fir&s;t &s;tock of books. Tho&s;e of devotion were intermixed, or at hand, to begin and end with . . . . He preached twice every Sunday, to keep the people from &s;traggling, and engage them to frequent the

church: otherwi&s;e he knew, and lamented, that we have but too much preaching in the nation. Finding, at length, his labour too great for him, yet, rather than le&s;&s;en it, (though in a &s;mall pari&s;h) he deter|mined to keep an a&s;&s;i&s;tant; to whom he committed the catechi&s;ing part, in his declining age, allowing him five &s;hillings per Sunday over and above thirty pounds per annum, and the benefit of his table all church days, &amp;c. with &s;everal gifts and advantages that made up the whole fifty pounds per annum . . . . He watched diligently over his flock, and would &s;uffer none to peri&s;h for want of admonition or reproof, as well in the &s;pirit of meekne&s;s as with all authority. Though he never &s;ued, cited, or pro&s;ecuted the mo&s;t injurious and ob&s;tinate offenders, yet he rebuked and avoided the unruly, and kept the impertinently cen&s;orious and perver&s;e at a due di&s;tance. He &s;o much the more de&s;erved of his pari&s;h, as he was more generous and charitable among them, than ju&s;t to him&s;elf, in di&s;regarding often his &s;mall tythes and perqui&s;ites, taking quietly what &s;ome left him, and helping all; wherein, to make all ju&s;t and ea&s;y too, he tried all po&s;&s;i|ble fair ways, without contention, by letting out the whole, and let|ting every man his part; and, at la&s;t, taking all in kind, when they would not come near the value. He kept up the true moderate Eng|li&s;h ho&s;pitality, genteelly managed by an excellent virgin-&s;i&s;ter, (who lived and died with him while he remained &s;ingle) and &s;ome few years after by a truly virtuous wife, though &s;ickly, for whom he &s;et up his coach, being mo&s;t tender of her, and &s;orrowful at her death. As he was a mo&s;t affectionate, tender hu&s;band and brother, &s;o he was a ju&s;t, indulgent ma&s;ter, and had, generally, careful and hone&s;t &s;er|vants, whom he took pains to make religious, peaceable, and &s;ober. He daily ob&s;erved the good old religious way of family-devotion. He &s;ometimes u&s;ed extempore &s;ermons (having a body of divinity in his head) until he was di&s;turbed and put into a con&s;ternation with his con|gregation, by a woman &s;wooning away in the church, who was &s;oon carried out and the people became &s;ilent; yet he could not recover his &s;ubject, or recollect any thing he had &s;aid before, which obliged him to make an apology, and come down. Though ea&s;y of acce&s;s, and courteous and affable, he di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons, times, and places&punc; His table-talk was both delightful and improving; he diverted &s;ad &s;tories, and decried fal&s;e ones: he would not willingly know a wick|ed per&s;on, nor &s;uffer a liar or tale-bearer in his fight. He never look|ed &s;o frowning, as when a certain gentleman was backbiting another and telling him a &s;candalous &s;tory; he &s;tarted up, and with emotion a&s;ked him, if he could face the ab&s;ent? which &s;oon confounded th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whi&s;perer.</P>
