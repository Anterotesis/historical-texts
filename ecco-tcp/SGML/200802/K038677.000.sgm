<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN fir&s;t, of a thou&s;and times, I read the&s;e curious epi&s;tles, which here I con&s;ecrate to rhime and immortality, when I found them equally fraught with hi&s;torical truth, as with political wi&s;dom; equally di&s;tingui&s;hed for elegance of man|ners, and accuracy of &s;tyle, I lamented, that they were compo&s;ed of peri&s;hable, pro&s;aick materials. With what &s;incere concern did I re|flect, that they mu&s;t &s;oon, too &s;oon! be lo&s;t to remembrance, or be &s;ent, in their news-papers, perhaps, to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to exerci&s;e the cri|tici&s;m of &s;ugar-planters, Negroes, and Creolians? I deplored the fate of the great man, to whom the &s;econd letter is addre&s;&s;ed, who&s;e <HI>good</HI> fame, <HI>o tempera, o mores!</HI> is hardly likely to &s;urvive his virtue, even in a monument, erected to the VIRO IMMORTALI.</P>
<P>I CONSIDERED from whence this calamity could ari&s;e, and I was immediately convinced, that if Homer had written the wrath of Achil|les, or Virgil the loves of Dido in pro&s;e, the hero and the heroine mu&s;t have long &s;ince experienced the common fate of mortality. The Mu&s;es, the Mu&s;es alone have the privelege of giving immortality. <HI>Mu&s;a vetat mori.</HI> Yet even the Mu&s;es cannot give it in pro&s;e. Shall it then hereafter be &s;aid, that two &s;uch per&s;onages, as the&s;e writers
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
appear to be in each other's Letters; &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed for their integrity, patrioti&s;m, abilities, and how tender is the expre&s;&s;ion! for their <HI>kind friend&s;hip,</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Mr. P--t's Letter.</NOTE> &s;hall they die, like mere mortals, <HI>quia ca|rent vate &s;acro</HI>; becau&s;e, <HI>No bard had they to make all time their own?</HI></P>
<P>ANIMATED by the&s;e, and other reflections, equally powerful, I de|termined to &s;natch the&s;e charming letters from oblivion; to give them to immortality, by <HI>doing</HI> them into ver&s;e, as nearly as the different idioms of pro&s;e and poetry can allow; and then to place them in friendly oppo&s;ition to each other, like pictures hung in contra&s;t to illu&s;trate each other's beauties.</P>
<P>THAT they are equally &s;u&s;ceptible of all the mo&s;t luxurious orna|ments of poetry, every critick mu&s;t allow; nor, if he be a critick of any tolerable &s;agacity, can he he&s;itate, even a moment, in pronounc|ing, that they are the works of the &s;ame ma&s;ter. Is there not the &s;ame everla&s;ting length of period, the &s;ame manly di&s;regard to gram|mar; the &s;ame loo&s;e, unconnected texture of expre&s;&s;ion; the &s;ame inconclu&s;ive, uncon&s;equential rea&s;oning, &s;o peculiarly fitted to the freedom and ea&s;e of epi&s;tolary writing? Beauties, like the&s;e, it is con|fe&s;&s;ed, have a kind of originality, which it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to pre|&s;erve in a tran&s;lation. Yet the reader will find, it hath been boldly attempted, and his candour will determine, I hope, not unfavourably, of the &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>IN an humble con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having merited that <HI>&s;ucce&s;s</HI> by the <HI>fide|lity</HI> of this tran&s;lation, I &s;hall venture to a&s;&s;ert, what few modern tran&s;|lators can pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert, that it &s;ometimes ri&s;es &s;uperior, in &s;ublimity and beauty, even to the original. This &s;uperiority, no doubt, proceeds
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
from a &s;ecret charm, that in general, animates the language of poetry, and particularly from the harmony of the numbers, which I have, not injudiciou&s;ly, cho&s;en. Be it known, therefore to all our minor poets, that doggrel is the proper mea&s;ure for the &s;ublime ideas of modern patrioti&s;m, panegyrick and addre&s;&s;es, of which I &s;hall con|vince the world, as &s;oon as a certain addre&s;s to his M----y, I beg pardon, I mean to his mini&s;ter, &s;hall make its appearance.</P>
<P>BUT not panegyrick alone, nor patrioti&s;m have their proper and peculiar mea&s;ures in poetry. When the ladies write love letters, all the numbers are elegiack. When our patriot-commoner rai&s;es his voice to a&s;&s;ert the rights of the people; to deplore the errour of admini&s;t|ration, or to vindicate his own injured reputation from the mi&s;repre|&s;entations of credulity and calumny, his diction in&s;tantly a&s;&s;umes the pomp of blank ver&s;e. La&s;tly, when Mr. P--t and Mr. B--d oblige the world with a private publick corre&s;pondence, the mutual ac|knowledgments of each other's merit; their <HI>kind</HI> profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip and e&s;teem naturally &s;ink together into doggrel.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I am in chri&s;tian charity; I bear no malice to pro&s;e or pro&s;emen. I think it falls down very naturally in notes, remarks and annotations to the bottom of the page. Witne&s;s doctor W--n's two huge coloumns of critici&s;m to &s;upport and explain two lines of Mr. Pope's poetry. In humble imitation of this right-reverend canoni&s;t in critici&s;m, I have bottomed my pages with notes <HI>variorum.</HI> I do not mean the <HI>variorum</HI> of per&s;ons only, but of learning, morality, cri|tici&s;m, politicks, and panegyrick. I confe&s;s, I have almo&s;t exhau&s;ted my common place-book; no matter; I &s;hall ea&s;ily fill it again with quotations of learning from our illu&s;trious moderns, and maxims of politicks from the common council at Guildhall.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">THE publick, no doubt, ingratitude, as well as curio&s;ity, will ex|pect to be informed, WHO and WHAT are the writers, to whom they are obliged for the&s;e letters: who have publi&s;hed them for their own <HI>&s;pontaneous</HI> bounty, <HI>un&s;olicited,</HI> and <HI>unmerited,</HI> as the pen&s;ion of Kings: who is this right honourable per&s;on, and his friend Mr. -----: this <HI>pius Aeneas</HI> and his <HI>fidus Achiates</HI>; this &s;econd Sir James H----s, who vouches for the &s;entiments of the city.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t Hague Gazette has tran&s;lated one of the&s;e letters into French, and a&s;&s;ures us, that it is writen by the right honourable Mr. Pitt to the Lord Mayor of London, whom it frequently &s;tyles, MON CHER MOXSIEUR. It likewi&s;e informs us, that Mr. Pitt, although di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his Office, yet regularly attends the frequent Councils held at Court. But as we have &s;ome rea&s;on to believe, that this intelligence is a little premature; that it is, at pre&s;ent, and probably will be for ever a mi&s;take, we may therefore believe, there may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome mi&s;take in the other in&s;tance. If indeed it were only a trivial anachron|i&s;m, in calling Mr. B----d, MY LORD; or might we think it pro|phetick of the next Year's Mayorality, then would I cry out with Co|reggio, <HI>I too am a Painter.</HI></P>
<L>Then &s;hould creolian B----d, like him&s;elf,</L>
<L>Start from the Canvas in his Native Hues,</L>
<L>The bronze tartarean, and Jamaica Tint,</L>
<L>Sun-burnt and deep enamell'd,</L>
<P>Then &s;hould he &s;tand in Oratorial Attitude, haranguing, <HI>loud,</HI> His and his Friend's fifteen Aldermen; their hundred common-council.</P>
<P>BUT to my ta&s;k adventurous. <HI>Ca&s;ta, O, Lucina, fave. Diva, pro|ducas &s;obolem, and give the &s;pringing birth to light.</HI></P>

How does a Dutch, or a French man dare to tran&s;late the Writings of our Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter? Can they have any Conception of his &s;ublime Ideas? He has expre&s;&s;ed, by the Word <HI>&s;urpri&s;e,</HI> the gentle&s;t emotion of the human Heart; while that of <HI>etonnement</HI> implies not only a tur|bulence of Pa&s;&s;ion, but a Di&s;order of the Under&s;tanding, unworthy of the right ho|nourable Per&s;on. <HI>Nil admirari</HI> is the motto of a great Man.</P><BIBL>MONITOR.</BIBL></NOTE> Having found with Surpri&s;e, that my late <NOTE N="[2]" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Re&s;ignation.</HI> Why Re&s;ignation? I hate the Word. No; it was an envious, malignant Faction, at a certain Board, that forced from his Maje&s;ty's Conucils the only Per&s;on, capable of directing them; that compelled him to quit the Service of the Publick. His Advice was rejected. The Plans he had formed, and the Mea&s;ures he had calculated for the Good of the Nation, were oppo&s;ed. After all his Labours of <HI>Fi|delity</HI> and <HI>Succe&s;s,</HI> a Peace, di&s;honourable <HI>no doubt,</HI> and di&s;advantageous, was to be concluded. He therefore prudently quitted an Employment, where he could not con|tinue with Honour, and where neither his Abilities, nor his Integrity could be any longer &s;erviceable to his Country.</P><BIBL>VOX POPULI.</BIBL></NOTE> Re&s;ignation,</L>

What a cold Expre&s;&s;ion of that ani|mated Indignation, which fires the Original! <HI>Gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented!</HI> In the&s;e two Words, he proves his Integrity, ju&s;tifies his Conduct, and vindicates the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own Worth. What Ideas are the&s;e! What Power of Language! No wonder, that the French Tongue &s;hould &s;ink under &s;uch im|agery, when the French Monarchy has already &s;unk under his Abilities, and the Weight of his Admini&s;tration.</P><BIBL>MONITOR.</BIBL></NOTE> Mi&s;repre&s;entation</L>
<L>Hath been gro&s;sly abus'd; that his Maje&s;ty's Grace,</L>
<L>Which follow'd, <NOTE N="[4]" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Spontaneous.</HI> That the King's Bounty was uncontrouled, uninfluenced, and freely flowing from the munificence of his own Nature, no Man ever doubted; none ever denied. Such, we apprehend, is the Meaning of the Word <HI>&s;pontaneous.</HI> To &s;ay, that this Bounty was <HI>unmerited,</HI> is in|deed a Compliment ju&s;tly paid to his Ma|je&s;ty's Genero&s;ity, though paid, perhaps, not without &s;ome Reproach to his Di&s;cern|ment. That it was <HI>un&s;olicited,</HI> is urged rather too incautiou&s;ly, and may hereafter admit of a Di&s;pute. Happy for the right honourable Per&s;on had he re&s;ted his De|fence, in this Article of it, upon the na|tural Goodne&s;s of his Prince. A grateful People would have unanimou&s;ly acknow|ledged the Ju&s;tice of his Plea.</P><BIBL>ALL THE COMMENTATORS IN ALL THE LANGUAGES OF EUROPE.</BIBL></NOTE> <HI>&s;pontaneous,</HI> my quitting my Place,</L>

There mu&s;t, therefore, &s;uch is the &s;trong Conclu&s;ion, have been &s;ome &s;ecret Merit in this, otherwi&s;e unaccountable, Re&s;ignation, and more than Royal Bounty in this Grant of Pen&s;ions and Honours.</P><BIBL>THE TEST.</BIBL></NOTE> Bargain, for having the Publick de&s;erted,</L>

This <HI>contradicting</HI> the manner is totally new to our Language. The French Tran&s;lator, no wonder, hath wholly lo&s;t the elegant jargon of the original ex|pre&s;&s;ion and ideas, when he renders it, <HI>a' une maniere, qui ne repugne nullement a la probite. A manner by no means repugnant to probity.</HI> Our Engli&s;h tran&s;lator, too, has lo&s;t the &s;pirit of the &s;entiment by coldly endeavouring to make it intelligible. <HI>The manner no gentleman &s;urely will blame.</HI></P><BIBL>CRITICAL REVIEW.</BIBL></NOTE> And the Manner, no Gentleman &s;urely will blame.</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="[1]" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>The City of London.</HI> What an Opening is here! The <HI>va&s;toque immanis hiatu</HI> is nothing to it. How alarming! How full of Expectation! Criticks may tell us of the mode&s;t Opening befitting an Epick Poem, but if Ari&s;totle were to ri&s;e from the Dead, and give us Rules for epi&s;tolary Wri|ting, he would take from this Example, the pathetick, animating Spirit of beginning all future Letters. THE CITY OF LON|DON! that is, the Capital of the World; the Mi&s;tre&s;s of Commerce; the Centre of Trade; who&s;e Shopkeepers are Politi|cians; who&s;e Aldermen are In&s;tructors to their Repre&s;entatives in Parliament, and who&s;e Common-Council Men are&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, what they are. What Ideas are the&s;e! What Images!</P><BIBL>ALL THE COMMENTATORS <HI>pa&s;&s;im &amp; univer&s;aliter.</HI></BIBL><P>What a Parcel of ignorant Blockheads are all the Commentators, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, with their <HI>pa&s;&s;im &amp; univer|&s;aliter,</HI> which, for aught I know, may be better than our City Latin. Not to know, that the City of London <HI>are</HI> only fifteen Aldermen and ninety Common-Council-Men! Yet the&s;e Fellows call them&s;elves Criticks, for&s;ooth, and Commentators!</P><BIBL>SIR JAMES HODGES.</BIBL><P>What! My old Friend, Sir James, again got into Print, and pre&s;enting us <HI>with the Key of Knowledge!</HI> Yet his Knighthood might have remembered, that &s;ix thou&s;and Per&s;ons in London vote for Members of Parliament, and that <HI>his</HI> City, who <HI>&s;end their</HI> In&s;tructions to tho&s;e Members, <HI>are</HI> very little more than one poor, paltry hun|dred. What then? The Secretary acknow|ledges their Authority, and bows him&s;elf to their Title. In one un&s;topped Period of an hundred and eighty Words, brave Words, indeed! magnanimous and &s;ound|ing, he reque&s;ts Sir James <HI>to expre&s;s his high Sen&s;e of the &s;ignal Honour</HI>&mdash;then, <HI>their con|de&s;cending and favourable Re&s;olution</HI>&mdash;then once again, the <HI>Honour, which he receives with true Reverence and Gratitude, not without Confu&s;ion at his own &s;mall De&s;er|vings</HI>&mdash;Was there ever &s;uch a Farce?</P><BIBL>THE TEST.</BIBL></NOTE> THE City of London mu&s;t for ever forget,</L>
<L>Or always remember, They are much in Your Debt,</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13">And that <NOTE N="[2]" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>You accepted the Seals.</HI> What Con|de&s;cen&s;ion! He &s;uffered him&s;elf to be pre|vailed on to accept! As a further Proof of his Mode&s;ty, he informed the late King, when he <HI>accepted</HI> the Seals, that he had never turned his Thoughts to con&s;ider the Nature of that Office, or had ever read any Treati&s;e upon the Subject. Yet, even then, he was determined not to accept of any other Employment.</P><BIBL>ANECDOTE.</BIBL></NOTE> You accepted the Seals, when the Nation&mdash;</L>
<L><NOTE N="[3]" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Never was Country reduced. &amp;c.</HI> The Writer here brings to our Remem|brance the inglorious State of our Affairs, when the honourable Per&s;on accepted the Seals. He fills the Scene with every gloo|my, melancholy Circum&s;tance, that he may afterwards pre&s;ent us with a more chearful Pro&s;pect of our Situation, when the Gentleman re&s;igned. Thus an able Pain|ter deepens and darkens the Ground of his Pictures, to give a greater Warmth to his Colouring, and a bolder Relief to his Fi|gures.</P><BIBL>TASTE.</BIBL><P>The&s;e may, po&s;&s;ibly, be Remarks of Ta&s;te, with regard to painting, but the Letter-Writer might well have been for|given, if he had a little le&s;s wantonly in|dulged him&s;elf in the Plea&s;ure of de&s;cribing the Calamities of his Country. Who does not honour his Friend's Abilities, and ac|knowledge his good Fortune? Yet &s;urely, it was by no means nece&s;&s;ary to the Vin|dication of his Integrity or Wi&s;dom in re|&s;igning, to &s;et him in Oppo&s;ition to the noble Duke, who had the Conduct of our Affairs at that Time of national Di&s;grace and Di&s;tre&s;s. Let it however be remem|bered, that our Patriot covered his Grace from the publick Re&s;entment by a mock Inquiry, and then joined with him in Ad|mini&s;tration.</P><BIBL>HISTORICAL REGISTER.</BIBL></NOTE> Sure never was Country in &s;uch Tribulation;</L>
<L>That our Armies were beaten, our Navy was laid</L>
<L>Inactive in Port, and expos'd was our Trade;</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14">That our Credit was bankrupt with all Corre&s;pondents,</L>
<L><NOTE N="[4]" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Abroad was Contempt.</HI> After this ju&s;t and animated De&s;cription, I do declare, I verily believe, that my Brother, who alone rai&s;ed the Nation from this Di&s;tre&s;s, is not only the greate&s;t, but the only Man in the Kingdom: that in him&s;elf he is King, Lords, Commons, and Cabinet-council: that he is the Sailor's Intrepidity, the Soldier's Courage, and all the Money in the Trea&s;ury; that he was Wolfe's happy Temerity, Amher&s;t's Conduct, and Prince Ferdinand's good Fortune, e&s;pecial|ly at the Battle of Minden: that he was An&s;on's Knowledge, Hawke's Re&s;olution, and Keppel's Ardour: that he withdrew his Spirit from Lord George, and from that Moment his Lord&s;hip &s;unk into a C&mdash;d. All this, and more, I firmly believe.</P><BIBL>LORD TEMPLE's CREED.</BIBL><P>Mu&s;t we not conclude from his Lord|&s;hip's Declaration of his political Faith, &s;o &s;olemnly pronounced, that Mr. Secretary had, by the Power of his Office, created the thirty thou&s;and Troops he &s;ent to Ger|many, and coined his twenty annual Mil|lions, for continental Armies, Sub&s;idies and Expeditions. How could a Nation, <HI>redu|ced to a State of Bankruptcy,</HI> rai&s;e the&s;e Millions; how could <HI>our beaten Armies</HI> rea&s;&s;ume the Courage of Britons? Impo&s;&s;i|ble. One Miracle more we mu&s;t acknow|ledge he has performed. He has made his noble Brother equally an Orator in the Hou&s;e, and a Politician in the Cabinet.</P><BIBL>CREDULITY.</BIBL><P>The Stocks, the great Mea&s;ure of pub|lick Credit, were twenty per cent higher, when the honourable Per&s;on accepted the Seals, than when he re&s;igned them.</P><BIBL>MATTER OF FACT.</BIBL></NOTE> Abroad was Contempt, and at home was De&s;pondence.</L>

<L>The City mu&s;t al&s;o remember for ever,</L>
<L>That when you re&s;ign'd, our Affairs were quite clever;</L>
<L>Our Armies triumphant, our Navies victorious,</L>
<L>And our Trade in a State, which it ne'er knew before us;</L>
<L>Our Credit re&s;tor'd, and the People more willing</L>

Why did they not employ &s;ome of the critical Reviewers, why did they wholly rely upon their City Scribe, Sir James? Even the Monitor could have expre&s;&s;ed &s;omething like a Meaning for them. But what &s;hall be &s;aid of the Mini&s;ter, who&s;e <HI>Fidelity and Succe&s;s</HI> have rendered his Coun|try thus contemptibly glorious, and thus impotently &s;ucce&s;sful?</P><BIBL>COMMON SENSE.</BIBL></NOTE> And the Neutrals amaz'd in profound Veneration.</L>

<HEAD>General REFLECTIONS upon the&s;e Letters.</HEAD>
<P>NEITHER in the Petulance of attempting to be a Wit, nor for the <HI>poor Renown of being &s;mart,</HI> nor yet to vindicate, as may po&s;&s;i|bly be &s;u&s;pected, my Rea&s;on by my Ri&s;ibility, did I a&s;&s;ume the Tone and Air of Plea&s;antry. The right honourable Per&s;on has made his Appeal to the Publick, and every Individual of that Publick is au|thori&s;ed to deliver his Sentiments upon it, in his own Manner, ac|cording to the Mea&s;ure of his Knowledge, his Abilities and Under|&s;tanding. For my Part, I was determined to try the Gentleman's Conduct by every Kind of Proof, even by that of Ridicule. If he &s;inks under this Proof, which is generally allowed to be no mean Te&s;t of Truth, his Re&s;ignation is blameable; and then it is of little Importance, by what Forms of Trial he &s;tands condemned. If he can &s;tand this Proce&s;s, he will come forth from it, like Gold from the Furnace, brighter and purer, and certainly not injured in his Weight.</P>
<P>SOME Expre&s;&s;ions in the&s;e Papers may po&s;&s;ibly be taxed with too much Levity, and others charged with too much Severity; yet when, in the fir&s;t of the&s;e Letters, whoever <HI>withdraws his good Opinion</HI> from the right honourable Per&s;on is repre&s;ented as <HI>capricious</HI> and <HI>ungenerous,</HI> and rated for <HI>a Credulity, weak as injurious</HI> (I pre&s;ume the Gentleman means unju&s;t) when, in the &s;econd Letter, all, who differ from the Writer's Sentiments, are frankly called Fools and Knaves, &s;urely &s;uch Coar&s;ene&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion will ju&s;tify all Kinds of Language in return.</P>
<P>I DO not make any over-earne&s;t Profe&s;&s;ions of my own Impartiality. I do not think my&s;elf exempted from that common Lot of all human
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Under&s;tandings, the being placed between Rea&s;on and Pa&s;&s;ion; be|tween Prejudice and Impartiality. I greatly fear, that our Friends are not always impartial; I truly believe, that our Enemies are not always malignant.</P>
<P>I CONFESS, I did not imagine this extraordinary Re&s;ignation was an Object of &s;uch pre&s;ent Importance, or probably productive of &s;uch future Con&s;equences, either good or evil, as to require any mighty Solemnity in the Manner of treating it; and perhaps the following Reflexions may convince my Readers, it was not for want of many a &s;erious Argument, that I have cho&s;en tho&s;e of Raillery and Ridi|cule. But here let me be permitted to lay before the Publick &s;ome Circum&s;tances concerning it, of which they have not yet been inform|ed, and upon which they may with ab&s;olute Certainty rely.</P>
<P>WHEN the right honourable Gentleman entered into Mini&s;try, he found every thing yielding to his Ambition. The late King, who&s;e Love for his native Country may ju&s;tly be numbered among his Vir|tues, mu&s;t have certainly been highly &s;atisfied with a Mini&s;ter, who &s;o largely gratified his favourite Pa&s;&s;ion: who poured forth the Blood and Trea&s;ures of Great Britain into Hanover, with a Profu&s;ion, which no other Mini&s;ter dur&s;t have ventured, or mu&s;t have ventured at the Hazard of his Head. Such were the effects of that Influence, which he had gained over the People, by repeated Profe&s;&s;ions of his Zeal for their Service; as if their Intere&s;ts were not united with tho&s;e of the other great Members of the State, or as if they could, even in Idea, be &s;eparated from tho&s;e of the Sovereign. His Maje&s;ty's Ser|vants in council &s;ilently acquie&s;ced (nor would I willingly impute it to
<PB N="19" REF="20">
them as a Crime) in this continental Prodigality. Every part of Ad|mini&s;tration concurred in a Compliance with his Directions; I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay, in an implicite Obedience to his Commands. Fleets were equipped; Regiments were rai&s;ed, Expeditions appointed, and the Trea&s;ury gave forth its Millions to his Order.</P>
<P>THUS did he exerci&s;e a Kind of De&s;poti&s;m, unknown to the Con|&s;titution, and de&s;tructive of every Idea of Liberty, until he was oppo&s;|ed, for the fir&s;t Time even by his own Account oppo&s;ed, in a Mea|&s;ure too precipitate, too important and too unju&s;t, to be complied with either by his Maje&s;ty, or his Servants. He propo&s;ed an immediate Declaration of War again&s;t Spain, at a Time, when &s;he was giving us every A&s;&s;urance of her Inclination to pre&s;erve the Peace and Ami|ty, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two Nations, and which it is their mutual Intere&s;t to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>IT is hardly conceivable, that he could either de&s;ire, or expect to &s;ucceed in &s;uch an extravagant Propo&s;al. What! to declare War, and commence Ho&s;tilities again&s;t a friendly Nation, without a&s;king a Sa|tisfaction for any &s;uppo&s;ed In&s;ults, a Redre&s;s of Injuries, or even an Ex|planation of Grievances! The Laws of Nature and Nations; the Ob|ligations of Treaties; the common Sen&s;e of Equity and Rea&s;on equal|ly di&s;claim a Proceeding, as unju&s;t, as precipitate.</P>
<P>BUT what have the Spaniards <HI>already done</HI> to provoke the Gentle|man's Indignation, and ju&s;tify his Re&s;entment? He neither urged any particular In&s;tance of their Partiality to the French; nor any new Vio|lations of our long-conte&s;ted Rights to cutting Logwood, nor even their Inju&s;tice with regard to the Antigallican and her Prize, which, be&s;ides &s;ome other Indignities, he temperately endured through the
<PB N="20" REF="21">
whole Cour&s;e of his admini&s;tration. But, &s;o it &s;eems, the Fulne&s;s of Time for his re&s;igning was not yet arrived; he was not yet tired of <HI>guiding</HI> and governing. But when he had taken a nearer View of the Port, to which the Ve&s;&s;el was driving with all the Sails he had crowd|ed upon her; when he &s;aw the Rocks and Shallows and Breakers, that threatened his Entrance into the Harbour; when he &s;aw the Coa&s;t covered with the &s;hip-wrecked Reputations of former Mini&s;ters, he prudently quitted the Helm, and retired, a &s;imple Pa&s;&s;enger, to his Cabin.</P>
<P>BUT really what had Spain <HI>already done?</HI> She had written to France to de&s;ire her good Offices with Great Britain; that when her Mini&s;ter was forming the general Articles of Peace, he might likewi&s;e pay &s;ome Attention to certain Matters of mutual Complaint between us and the Spaniards, which might po&s;&s;ibly occa&s;ion &s;ome future Rup|ture between the two Kingdoms, and di&s;turb the Tranquility of Eu|rope. What is there either &s;o injurious, or offen&s;ive in this Proceed|ing, that could have ju&s;tified the Nation in declaring War, or could particularly ju&s;tify the Mini&s;ter, who had borne, with rather a too pa&s;|&s;ive Spirit, &s;ome real Indignities from the Spaniards; &s;ome real Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>MR. BUSSY probably exceeded his Commi&s;&s;ion, or executed it with In&s;olence; or if this Letter could rea&s;onably give Umbrage to us, why not call for an Explanation of it? Why not demand a Copy of it, and if denied&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No: the Spaniards will certainly de|clare War again&s;t us. Let us prevent them."</Q> When it was urg|ed that they would think twice before they declared War again&s;t this Kingdom: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will not give them Leave to think,"</Q> was the &s;pirit|ed An&s;wer of our Mini&s;ter. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This is the Time; let us cru&s;h the
<PB N="21" REF="22">
whole Hou&s;e of Bourbon. But, if the Members of this Board are of another Opinion, this is the la&s;t Time I &s;hall ever mix in its Councils. I was called into Mini&s;try by the Voice of the Peo|ple, and to them I hold my&s;elf an&s;werable for my Conduct. I am to thank the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>late</HI> King for their Support. I have &s;erved my Country with Succe&s;s, but I will not be re&s;|pon&s;ible for the Conduct of the War any longer, than while I have the Direction of it."</Q> This la&s;t Declaration was by no means equivocal. It was a frank and open Demand of an unlimited Au|thority, and unconditional Obedience.</P>
<P>THE noble Lord, who pre&s;ided in this Council; to whom Years have added the Wi&s;dom of Experience without abating the Vigour and Fire of Youth; who&s;e natural and acquired Abilities are un|que&s;tionable as great, as ever this Gentleman could boa&s;t; who was him&s;elf as bold a Mini&s;ter, as ever directed the Affairs of this Na|tion, made him this temperate Reply. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I find the Gentleman is determined to leave us, nor can I &s;ay, I am &s;orry for it; &s;ince he would otherwi&s;e have certainly compelled us to leave <HI>Him.</HI> But, if he be re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ume the Right of advi&s;ing his Maje&s;ty, and directing the Operations of the War, to what purpo&s;e are we called to this Council? When he talks of being re&s;pon&s;ible to the People, he talks the Language of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and forgets, that at this Board, he is only re&s;pon&s;ible to the King. However, though he may po&s;&s;ibly have convinced him&s;elf of his Infallibility, &s;till it remains, that we &s;hould be equally convinced before we can re&s;ign our Under&s;tandings to his Direction, or join with him in the Mea&s;ure he propo&s;es."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="23">HE bore the Rebukings of this An&s;wer without making any Reply, but he had gone too far, though perhaps not without repenting, to retreat. He therefore re&s;igned the Seals, which were received with an Ea&s;e and Firmne&s;s, that he probably very little expected. The King, with his u&s;ual Goodne&s;s, expre&s;&s;ed his Concern for the Lo&s;s of &s;o able a Servant, and to &s;hew the favourable Sen&s;e he entertained of his Services, was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to make him an Offer of any Rewards in the Power of the Crown to be&s;tow. His Maje&s;ty then added, with regard to the Mea&s;ure propo&s;ed, that he would certainly have found Him&s;elf under the greate&s;t Difficulty, how to have acted, even though the whole Council had concurred in &s;upporting it. A Sentiment of infinite Honour to him, who uttered it, not only as it a&s;&s;erts a royal Prerogative, which for the Good of his People He &s;hould ever pre&s;erve, but as it vindicates tho&s;e nobler Prerogatives of his Rea&s;on, his Under&s;tanding and his Con&s;cience. But the&s;e Pre|rogatives, in all Probability, the right honourable Gentlem&agrave;n never thought of. However, this Conde&s;cen&s;ion, with which he was treat|ed, affected him &s;trongly. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I confe&s;s, Sir, I had but too much Rea|&s;on to expect your Maje&s;ty Di&s;plea&s;ure. I did not come prepared for this exceeding Goodne&s;s. Pardon me Sir,&mdash;it over-pow|ers; it oppre&s;&s;es me."</Q> He bur&s;t into Tears.</P>
<P>HIS Lady's Title, and his own Pen&s;ion, were &s;ettled next Day between Lord Bute and Him; when certainly the Title, and pro|bably the Sum of the Pen&s;ion, was of his own <HI>free</HI> Choice. His Friends at fir&s;t, warmly di&s;claimed the In&s;inuation of his taking a Pen|&s;ion. They called it a ba&s;e and momentary Artifice to bla&s;t his Re|putation. They di&s;dained his receiving any Honours from a Ma&s;ter, whom he no longer thought proper to &s;erve. "What Title," thus
<PB N="23" REF="24">
they exclaimed, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"can be half &s;o honourable, as being &s;tyled the Patriot Mini&s;ter; the Mini&s;ter of the People? What Honour can de&s;cend to his Po&s;terity, equal to the hi&s;torical Truth, that he has &s;aved his Country from Ruin and Reproach; that he has rai&s;ed her to Glory and Happine&s;s?"</Q> But &s;ince it is no longer an In&s;inuation, that he has received his Pen&s;ion; &s;ince his accepting a Title for his Lady can be no longer an <HI>Artifice of his Enemies,</HI> his Friends endeavour to defend his <HI>bla&s;ted</HI> Reputation.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t attempt for this Purpo&s;e, yet offered to the publick, is in a Pamphlet, entitled, <HI>The Conduct of a right honourable Gen|tleman, ju&s;tified by Facts, and upon the Principles of the Briti&s;h Con|&s;titution.</HI> It is written with Temper, and has a Degree of Know|ledge, though certainly not that of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, rarely found among us Pamphleteers. His fir&s;t Propo&s;ition is, <HI>that</HI> Mr. Pitt <HI>could not, con&s;i&s;tently with his own Safety, continue in the high Po&s;t he held, after being forced to deviate from the great Lines of conduct he had chalked out when he fir&s;t entered upon it.</HI> In page 44, he tells us, <HI>thus, I think, I have fully demon&s;trated my fir&s;t Propo&s;ition.</HI> As he has not thought proper to inform us what the&s;e <HI>great Lines of Conduct</HI> are (perhaps not much &s;traighter than Hogarth's Line of Beauty) from whence the right honourable Per&s;on <HI>was forced to deviate</HI>; nor told us, why, or by whom he was thus forced, we cannot be quite convinced, that he has demon&s;trated his fir&s;t Propo&s;ition. But how demon&s;trated? By a tedious Detail of Injuries, committed again&s;t us by Spain: a Detail of uncertain, unauthenticated Facts. Let me not &s;eem to &s;u&s;pect the Writer's own Belief of the&s;e Facts, but granting them true; granting, that Mr. Pitt was convinced of their Truth, yet it never can be demon&s;trated either from their Truth, or
<PB N="24" REF="25">
his Conviction, that his Re&s;ignation was nece&s;&s;ary to his Safety. The Rectitude or Error of his conduct in this In&s;tance ari&s;es from the Rea&s;on, which he him&s;elf hath given for it, that he was <HI>no longer allowed to guide.</HI></P>
<P>THE great Chillingworth repeatedly cries out, the Bible, the Bible is the Religion of Prote&s;tants. Thus would I repeat, the Law, the Law is the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution. Where therefore is the Law, by which Mr. Pitt's Safety could have been affected, if he had conti|nued in Office, after the Mea&s;ure he propo&s;ed of declaring War again&s;t Spain was rejected? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But evil Councellors are liable by the Law to puni&s;hment."</Q> True; and may they ever be liable. Yet the Mini&s;ter, who does not give any Coun&s;el; who enters his Prote&s;t again&s;t the Coun&s;el, given by others, &s;hall be liable to Puni&s;hment, as an evil Coun&s;ellor? If for the &s;ake of pre&s;erving that unanimity, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary at this dangerous Cri&s;is of our Affairs; if in a mode&s;t Dif|fidence of his own Judgment, or a le&s;s outrageous Contempt for that of others, Mr. Pitt had &s;ilently complied with the united Opinions of His Maje&s;ty, and all the Members of the Cabinet, could &s;uch Com|pliance ever be imputed to him as a Crime; could it endanger his Safety? If there be any Law, that declares the Guilt of &s;uch Com|pliance, or threatens his Safety for it, let it be produced; or let it never be urged hereafter, even by his Fears, whether they be real or affected.</P>
<P>OUR Writer, &s;o learned in the <HI>Principles and Maxims of the Bri|ti&s;h Con&s;titution,</HI> is candid enough to acknowledge, Pag. 51. <HI>that neither the Con&s;titution, nor Laws of this Country define the po&s;t or power of a Mini&s;ter of State, or even &s;uppo&s;e, that any &s;uch can exi&s;t.</HI> True
<PB N="25" REF="26">
indeed. The Con&s;titution di&s;claims, abhors and dreads even the Idea of &s;uch a Mini&s;ter. Yet, &s;trange proof how a bad cau&s;e can pervert a good Under&s;tanding! The very Gentleman, who makes this candid Conce&s;&s;ion, founds Mr. Pitt's Defence upon his being not only a Mini&s;ter, but <HI>a fir&s;t, a directing</HI> Mini&s;ter: Terms, as new as unknown to the Con&s;titution as that of <HI>guiding,</HI> and as heartily to be dete&s;ted.</P>
<P>IT is the peculiar Excellence of this Con&s;titution, that the Powers of Government are divided among the three E&s;tates of which it is compo&s;ed. Should any one of the&s;e E&s;tates become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than its proper &s;hare of Power, the Con&s;titution, with all its Ble&s;&s;ings of Religion, Liberty, and Property, is in&s;tantly di&s;&s;olved. The King becomes a Tyrant, the Hou&s;e of Lords an Ari&s;tocracy, and the People a Democracy. Shall one Man therefore, a &s;imple Citizen, dare to a&s;|&s;ume to him&s;elf all the different Powers of Government? Shall he pre|&s;ume to make War and Peace? Shall he rai&s;e Armies, fit out Fleets, plan Expeditions, and lavi&s;h away the publick Trea&s;ure, under this new-invented Title, <HI>a guiding</HI> Mini&s;ter? The very Claim of &s;uch a Power is an in&s;olent Outrage to the Laws, the Con&s;titution, the Li|berty of our Country, and this Right Honourable Per&s;on is the fir&s;t, that ever made this outrageous Claim. If any one Man were ca|pable of executing &s;uch a Power, yet never &s;hould it be intru&s;ted, (I &s;peak with all po&s;&s;ible Reverence and Re&s;pect,) no, not for a Mo|ment to any one Man, even to THE BEST OF SOVEREIGNS.</P>
<P>IF among the great Lines of this Gentleman's Conduct, he de|termined never to join in any Mea&s;ure, which he was not <HI>allowed to guide</HI>; or in &s;omewhat mode&s;ter Language, if he re&s;olved to re&s;ign,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
whenever he was unable to convince the other Members of the Council, of the Wi&s;dom, the Ju&s;tice, or Utility of the Mea&s;ures he propo&s;ed, permit me to a&s;k, what mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence, if every other Member, (and his equal Right, I pre&s;ume, will not be denied) &s;hould take the &s;ame Re&s;olution? In vain will his Maje&s;ty call to|gether a Number of his Servants for their Advice in Matters of Doubt and Importance, if each of them in his Turn, may withdraw him|&s;elf from his Duty to his Country, for I pre&s;ume &s;uch a Duty will be acknowledged, whenever his Opinion is contradicted.</P>
<P>BUT it &s;eems the right honourable Per&s;on is not di&s;abled by his Re&s;ignation, <HI>from offering his opinion to his Maje&s;ty, his Parliament and his Council with as much Freedom, and with more weight, than he could have had, had he retained the Seals of his Office.</HI> In what manner he will exert his Abilities, or &s;hew forth his Zeal for his Country, and his inviolable Attachment to the Intere&s;ts of the People, he pro|bably has not yet determined. Perhaps, he will endeavour to con|vince the Hou&s;e of Commons, that he is endowed with &s;ome pe|culiar Spirit, &s;ome certain &s;uperior In&s;tinct, fitted for planning and executing all the great Mea&s;ures of Government. But I truly hold it of little Importance to the State of the Nation, whether he &s;its in the &s;ilence of his Pen&s;ion, or ri&s;es, in the Spleen of di&s;appointed Ambition, a futile Declaimer again&s;t the Mea&s;ures of Government.</P>
