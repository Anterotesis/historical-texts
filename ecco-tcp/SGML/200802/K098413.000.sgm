<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantage of a clear, comprehen&s;ive, and regu|lar view of the <HI>FIGURES,</HI> the <HI>TYPES,</HI> and the <HI>PRE|DICTIONS</HI> of &s;cripture, is obvious. In the <HI>FIRST,</HI> we ob|&s;erve the &s;urpri&s;ing eloquence of Heaven, and di&s;cern al|mo&s;t every form in nature, a guide to, and an illu&s;trator of in&s;pired truth. By the <HI>SECOND,</HI> we perceive the whole &s;ub&s;tance of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, truly exhibited in ancient &s;hadows, per&s;ons, and things;&mdash;in laws apparently carnal and trifling. In the <HI>THIRD,</HI> we ob&s;erve how a&s;toni&s;hing|ly in&s;pired predictions properly arranged, and compared with the hi&s;tory of nations and churches, do illu&s;trate each other; and modern events, as with the evidence of mi|racles, confirm our faith in the oracles of God. The u&s;efulne&s;s of what I have attempted, with re&s;pect to all the <HI>THREE,</HI> mu&s;t be le&s;t to the providence of God.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent <HI>MEDITATIONS,</HI> relate to the <HI>FIGURES</HI> of &s;acred writ. To avoid too peremptory parallels, and to awaken devotion, they are ca&s;t into the pre&s;ent form. The <HI>EMBLEMS,</HI> the &s;ignification of which appeared uncertain or DIVer&s;ified, are repeated under different heads. To &s;hun interfering with <HI>TYPES,</HI> many rich <HI>EMBLEMS,</HI> as of <HI>ZION, PRIESTS, &amp;c.</HI> are wholly omitted, or but &s;lightly touched. To &s;hun a tire&s;ome length, and a &s;inking dul|ne&s;s, that which was ju&s;t before hinted on a &s;imilar <HI>EM|BLEM,</HI> is not &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed over; and the hi&s;tory of <HI>EM|BLEMS</HI> is le&s;t to be collected from the account of the <HI>OB|JECTS</HI> which they repre&s;ent; nor on <HI>THIS</HI> are ought but hints offered, and the enlargement is left to the reader's own meditation. What friendly indulgence is requi&s;ite to pardon mi&s;takes, the peru&s;er mu&s;t judge. Meanwhile, it is hoped he will remember, that the e&s;pial of faults is much ea&s;ier work than to avoid them.</P>

<HEAD>BOOK I. <HI>SCRIPTURE-language in general.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the manner of the Ea&s;t, the language of in&s;pira|tion abounds with the mo&s;t &s;triking and in&s;tructive figures. In noble and candid &s;implicity,&mdash;in bold allu&s;ion, not all the writings of men can vie with the&s;e oracles of God. Here,&mdash;as one would expect in the idiom of Godhead, the principal truths are brought down to the weake&s;t capacity, that ignorance may have nothing to plead for excu&s;e; others, chiefly predic|tions, are often wrapped up in figures, ob&s;cure, and hard to be under&s;tood. Thus, till the fulfilment, the learned are forced to acknowledge their ignorance, and malicious oppo&s;ers rendered incapable to &s;top the pre|dicted event.</P>
<P>The figures of &s;acred language are either SIMPLE or COMPLEX. The former, without changing the native &s;en&s;e of the words, embelli&s;h the &s;tile, enliven the re|pre&s;entation, or illu&s;trate the &s;ubject: the latter, while they ennoble the &s;tile, and illu&s;trate the &s;ubject, do al&s;o convert the terms, from their ordinary &s;ignification, to another connected with it.</P>
<P>Simple figures are, 1. A REPETITION of the &s;ame term or phra&s;e; whether in the &s;ame, or in different &s;en|tences
<PB N="2" REF="6">
of a chapter, or &s;ection; as of MY, P&s;al. xviii. 1. 2. 3.; <HI>my</HI> God, P&s;al. xxii. 1. and cxviii. 28.; <HI>my help,</HI> P&s;al. cxxi. 1. 2.;<HI>&mdash;what&s;oever things are,</HI> Phil iv. 8.; <HI>his mercy endureth for ever,</HI> P&s;al. cxxxvi.; <HI>Lord our Lord,</HI> &amp;c. P&s;al. viii. 1. 9. 2. DIVERSIFYING of the &s;en&s;e, while the &s;ound is nearly retained. Thus, <HI>Walk in the fle&s;h;</HI> and <HI>war after the fle&s;h;</HI> agree pretty much in found, but differ va&s;tly in &s;en&s;e. 3. CHANGING of the &s;en&s;e of a word in the &s;ame &s;entence. Thus <HI>good,</HI> in Matth. xix. 16. &s;ignifies, fir&s;t, what is <HI>good</HI> and u&s;eful, in a limited &s;en&s;e; and then, what is infinitely and originally <HI>good: fruit of the vine,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 29. both &s;ignifies natural wine, and eternal happine&s;s. 4. CONFORMATION of the &s;ound of the terms, to the mournful, the joyful, the terrible, deter&s;table, or ami|able nature of the &s;ubject. Thus the portion of the wicked is de&s;cribed in words &s;ounding forth terror, P&s;al. xi. 5. 6.; the la&s;t day, in mo&s;t dreadful language, 2 Pet. iii. 10. 12. 5. OUTCRIES of admiration, ab|horrence, deri&s;ion, commendation, wi&s;hing, pity, joy, grief; as, <HI>How great is his goodne&s;s!</HI> Zech. ix. 17. <HI>O wretched man that I am!</HI> &amp;c. Rom. vii. 24, <HI>O woman great is thy &s;aith!</HI> Matth. xv. 28. 6. CORRECTIONS of what was ju&s;t before a&s;&s;erted; as, <HI>Yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me,</HI> Gal. ii. 20. <HI>Yet not I, but the grace of God,</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 10. 7. In promi&s;es, the re|ward; and e&s;pecially that which is terrible in a threat|ening, complaint, or oath, is &s;ometimes partly SUP|PRESSED: as, <HI>He &s;hall be chief ana captain,</HI> 2 Sam. v. 8. <HI>I will drive him out,</HI> Gen. iii. 22. <HI>Wilt thou ca&s;t me off?</HI> P&s;al. vi. 3. <HI>Let me cea&s;e to exi&s;t,</HI> if I lie, P&s;al. lxxxix. 35. 8. Interrupting ADDRESSES: as, of Ne|hemiah to God, chap. iv. 4. 5.; of God, by Joel, to the Hebrews, chap. ii. 12. 13.; of David to the moun|tains of Gilboa; to the daughters of I&s;rael; to Jona|than, 2 Sam. i. 21. 24. 25. 26. 9. INTRODUCTION of &s;peeches, real or feigned: as, of the cho&s;en ruler of Judah, I&s;. iii. 7.; of their women, I&s;. iv. 1.; of the fir-trees, and of the dead, I&s;. xiv. 8. 9.; of hell and de&s;truction, Job xxviii. 22. When the&s;e &s;peeches are wicked, they are &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed, not as uttered by the author, but as they truly meant. Thus, &s;inful
<PB N="3" REF="7">
means of relief are called <HI>a covenant with hell, and a|greement with death,</HI> I&s;. xxviii. 15.: flattering prophe|cies are called <HI>deceits,</HI> I&s;. xxx. 10.: fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es are called <HI>&s;ons of Belial,</HI> 1 Kings xxi. 10. 10. QUESTIONS, expre&s;&s;ive of ab&s;urdity, wonder, doubt, demon&s;tra|tion, expo&s;tulation, anger, in&s;ult, grief, negation, pity, de&s;ire, refu&s;al, prohibition: as, <HI>How can a man be born when he is old?</HI> John iii. 4. <HI>How excellent is thy loving kindne&s;s!</HI> P&s;al. xxxvi. 7. <HI>Shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</HI> Gen. xvii. 17. <HI>Is anything too hard for the Lord?</HI> Gen. xviii. 14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 11. APPEALS to tho&s;e who are argued again&s;t: as, of the apo&s;tles to the Jewi&s;h rulers, Acts iv. 19.; of Paul to the Galatians, chap. iii. 2. 12. RETORTION, or throwing back an accu&s;ation or objection, on the &s;tarter of it. So God throws back the charge of <HI>inju&s;tice</HI> on the Jews, who charged him with it, Ezek. xviii.: the Syrophenician woman pleads the character of a <HI>dog,</HI> thrown out a|gain&s;t her,&mdash;as an argument for mercy, Matth. xv. 26. 27. To repel the que&s;tion, By what authority he act|ed? Je&s;us po&s;ed the inquirers, <HI>Whether the bapti&s;m of John was from heaven, or of men?</HI> Matth. xxi. 23.&mdash;25. 13. PREVENTION of objections, by an&s;wering them be|fore they be &s;tarted: Thus the objection, of God's de|&s;erting his church, is prevented, I&s;. xlix. 14. 15. 14. An apparent YIELDING of that which an oppo&s;er pleads, in order to &s;hew its ab&s;urdity; or its in&s;ufficiency to e&s;tabli&s;h the point in di&s;pute. So Paul grants the Jews to have great knowledge of the law, and a capacity to in&s;truct others;&mdash;in order to &s;hew them, how their &s;in in breaking the law was aggravated, Rom. ii. 17.&mdash;24. James grants the ungodly profe&s;&s;or, that he <HI>had faith;</HI> but &s;hews that the devils al&s;o <HI>believed and trembled,</HI> Jam. ii. 19. 15. ASSIGNATION of the rea&s;on of an action, or name. Thus, Paul was not a&s;hamed of the go&s;pel, becau&s;e it was <HI>the power of God for &s;alvation to believers;</HI> and it was &s;o, becau&s;e <HI>therein the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God was revealed,</HI> Rom. i. 16. 17. The law &s;ilenceth and condemns all men, becau&s;e <HI>by it is the knowledge of &s;in;</HI> and therefore, <HI>by the deeds of it &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified;</HI> Rom. iii. 19. 20. No man can be &s;aved by the law; <HI>becau&s;e it worketh wrath</HI> in our corrupt nature again&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="8">
God, and condemns us to his ju&s;t wrath, Rom. iv. 14. 15. 16. Lively DESCRIPTIONS; which, as it were, pre|&s;ent the objects to our eyes, and other &s;en&s;es: as, of Tophet, I&s;. xxx. 33.; of Goliah, 1 Sam. xvii. 4.&mdash;6.; of God's compa&s;&s;ion, Jer. xxxi. 20. Ho&s;. xi. 7. 8. 17. DI|GRESSIONS; in which the &s;peaker, for a time, turns a&s;ide from his immediate &s;ubjects, and de&s;cants upon an object occa&s;ionally mentioned. Thus the apo&s;tles often turn a&s;ide to di&s;cour&s;e concerning Je&s;us Chri&s;t: as Rev. i. 5.&mdash;8. Col. i. 14.&mdash;22. 18. TRANSITIONS; in which one part of the &s;entence re&s;pects that which went before, and another what follows. Thus, <HI>Covet ear|ne&s;tly the be&s;t gifts,</HI> re&s;pects what precedes; and, <HI>I &s;hew you a more excellent way,</HI> that which follows, 1 Cor. xii. 31. 19. CONTRASTS; in which &s;ubjects di&s;|&s;imilar are compared, in order to mark clearly the na|ture, value, or unworthine&s;s of the one: &s;o the condi|tion of the wicked is contra&s;ted with that of the righ|teous, P&s;al. i. God's kindne&s;s, and mens unfruitful|ne&s;s and wickedne&s;s, are contra&s;ted, I&s;. v. 1.&mdash;4. Men and the Holy Gho&s;t are contra&s;ted, Acts v. 4. 20. COM|PARISON of things, like or unlike, in order to argue from the one to the other. Thus Chri&s;t argues from the le&s;&s;er to the greater, Matth. vi. 30. and vii. 11.; and that God is to feared rather than men, Matth. x. 28. 21. INDUCTION; by which compound things are repre&s;ented in their various parts. And here there is, generally, an a&s;cending, as to the object, or the lan|guage. Thus the de&s;olation of a country is de&s;cribed from the ca&s;e of the fields, the inhabitants, people, prie&s;t, &s;ervant, ma&s;ter, &s;eller, buyer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I&s;. xxiv. 1. 2. 3. God's ju&s;t judgment is repre&s;ented in his reward|ing the righteous, and puni&s;hing the wicked, Rom. ii. 6.&mdash;9. The re&s;urrection is de&s;cribed, as partly to hap|pine&s;s, and partly to damnation, John v. 28. 29. Chri&s;t's &s;tate is de&s;cribed, from the deba&s;ed and exalted circum&s;tances of it, Phil. i. 6.&mdash;10. Thus the &s;in or the judgment of men is often de&s;cribed, in a variety of particulars, Ezek. xxii. and xxiii. 22. CROWDING of various qualities or things into one &s;entence: as, of &s;a|crifices, rams, bullocks, lambs, he-goats, vain oblations, new moons, &s;abbaths, a&s;&s;emblies, I&s;. i. 11. 13. 14.; of

CIRCUMLOCUTIONS; in which, for mode&s;ty, or to &s;weeten or heighten the language, the proper name of an object is avoided, and an indirect de&s;crip|tion is given in its &s;tead. So a chamber-pot is called a <HI>ve&s;&s;el wherein there is no plea&s;ure,</HI> Jer. xxii. 2. 8. Urine is called the <HI>waters of the feet,</HI> 2 Kings xviii. 27. Heb. Death is called <HI>the king of terrors,</HI> Job xviii. 14. 25. RE|FERENCES; in which the words, or &s;en&s;e of another &s;peaker, or writer, are quoted, or alluded to. Here the words are &s;ometimes quoted, in a &s;en&s;e which they did not originally &s;eem to bear; and &s;ometimes the terms or the &s;en&s;e of DIVers pa&s;&s;ages are conjunctly quo|ted into one.&mdash;Quotations or allu&s;ions abound in the New Te&s;tament, Matth. i. 23. and xxi. 4. 5. Acts vii. 43. <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.:</HI> concerning which, many excellent ob&s;er|vations may be found in Carpzow's <HI>Defence of the Bible.</HI></P>
<P>Complex figures are, metonymy; &s;ynecdoche; meio|&s;is; hyperbole; irony; metaphor.</P>
<P>By METONYMY, the name of <HI>one object</HI> is given to <HI>another,</HI> becau&s;e of &s;ome <HI>connection,</HI> not <HI>&s;imilitude,</HI> be|twixt them. Thus, 1. The name of the matter, the author, the cau&s;e, or in&s;trument, is given to that which is produced from, or by it; or the name of the effect is given to the author, cau&s;e, or in&s;trument. Thus the wood in the hou&s;es and furniture of Jeru&s;alem is called a <HI>fore&s;t,</HI> Jer. xxi. 14. Ezek. xx. 46.; the tem|ple, for its plenty of cedar-wood that grew in Leba|non, is called <HI>Lebanon,</HI> Zech. xi. 1.; a heavenly frame is called <HI>the Spirit,</HI> Rev. i. 10.; the name of a father, as of Jacob, Moab, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is given to his po&s;terity, I&s;. xliii. 22. and xvi.; a te&s;timony is called the <HI>mouth,</HI> Deut. xvii. 6.; &s;peech is called the <HI>tongue,</HI> Prov. xxv. 15.; the benefits God be&s;tows are called his <HI>love,</HI> 1 John
<PB REF="10">
iii. 1. Contrariwi&s;e, Chri&s;t is called <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> becau&s;e he is the author of it, Gen. xlix. 18.; E&s;au's, taking Canaaniti&s;h wives is called a <HI>grief, i. e.</HI> a cau&s;e of grief, Gen. xxvi. 35.; the go&s;pel is called <HI>the power of God, i. e.</HI> the in&s;trument of exerting it, Rom. i. 16.; victory over the world is called <HI>faith,</HI> as faith obtains it, 1 John v. 4.; the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of I&s;rael is called <HI>Samaria;</HI> and the high-places of Judah, <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e cities chiefly promoted wickedne&s;s and idolatry, Mic. i. 5; wi&s;dom and knowledge are called <HI>&s;tability,</HI> be|cau&s;e they are the means of it, I&s;. xxxiii. 6. 2. The name of a &s;ubject is given to its adjunct; and of an ad|junct to its &s;ubject. Thus a city, a country, the earth, the world, is put for the inhabitants of it, Jer. iv. 29. Gen. vi. 11.; a cup, for that which is contained in it, 1 Cor. xi. 25. <HI>This cup,</HI> &amp;c. P&s;al. xxxiii. 4.; a ne&s;t for the pullets in it, Deut xxii. 11.; the heart, for the de&s;ires, or other things, contained in it, P&s;al. lxii. 8.; <HI>Pour out your hearts.</HI> The name of a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, is given to what is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; &s;o Chri&s;t's people are called him&s;elf, Matth. xxv. 35.&mdash;45. Acts ix. 4. 1 Cor. xii. 12.; &s;o <HI>the Lord, i. e.</HI> what offerings belonged to him, is call|ed Levi's inheritance, Deut. x. 9. The name of the thing &s;ignified is given to the &s;ign; &s;o the wine in the Lord's &s;upper is called <HI>Chri&s;t's blood,</HI> or the <HI>New Te&s;tament in it,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 26.; and of the &s;ign to the thing &s;ig|nified; the &s;overeign rule is called a <HI>&s;ceptre,</HI> Gen. xlix. 10. The name of the quality is given to its &s;ubject; &s;o a &s;carlet and crim&s;on coloured thing is called <HI>&s;carlet</HI> and <HI>crim&s;on,</HI> I&s;. i. 18. The name of that which is con|tained, is given to that which contains it; &s;o fields are called <HI>the upper and nether &s;prings,</HI> Jo&s;h. xv. 19. 3. Names are put for the per&s;on or thing named; &s;o the <HI>name</HI> of Chri&s;t, or of God, often &s;ignifies preci&s;ely <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or <HI>God</HI> him&s;elf, Acts iv. 12. Deut xxviii. 58. 4. Per&s;ons and things are named according to appear|ance, not reality: &s;o angels are called <HI>men,</HI> Gen. xviii.; Satan is called <HI>Samuel,</HI> 1 Sam. xxviii. 14.&mdash;20.; error is called a <HI>go&s;pel,</HI> Gal. i. 6&punc;</P>
<P>By SYNCEDOCHE, 1. More univer&s;al terms are put for &s;uch as are more re&s;tricted: as ALL, for <HI>many;</HI> for all kinds; for the greater or better part, Matth. iii. 5.
<PB N="7" REF="11">
and xix. 28.; <HI>the world,</HI> for the Roman empire, the Gentiles, the wicked, the Antichri&s;tians, Luke ii. 1. 1 John ii. 2. and v. 18. Rev. xiii. 8.; <HI>every creature,</HI> for men, Mark xvi. 15.; or the plural number for the &s;ingular, as <HI>children,</HI> for child, Gen. xxi. 7. 2. More re&s;tricted terms are put for &s;uch as are more exten&s;ive: as, <HI>one</HI> for all of the kind, P&s;al. i. 1.; <HI>ye&s;terday,</HI> for time pa&s;t, Heb. xiii. 8,; a limited number, as <HI>thrice, &s;even,</HI> or ten <HI>times,</HI> for frequently, 2 Cor. xii. 8. P&s;al. cxix. 164.; a <HI>thou&s;and, five thou&s;and,</HI> for an uncertain number, I&s;. xxx. 17. 3. A whole per&s;on, thing, place, or time, is put for an adjunct or part of it.

<P>By HYPERBOLE, things are repre&s;ented, as far more in&s;ignificant, great, glorious, or numerous, than they really are.

<P>To under&s;tand Metaphors, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the foundation thereof is LIKENESS between the things from which the metaphor is drawn, and that to which it is applied. When this likene&s;s is exhibited in one or a few expre&s;&s;ions, it is a SIMPLE METAPHOR, When it is pur&s;ued with a variety of expre&s;&s;ions, or there is a continued a&s;&s;emblage of metaphors, it is called an AL|LEGORY. When the re&s;emblance is har&s;h and far fetch|ed, as to <HI>&s;et a voice,</HI> it is a CATACHRESIS. When it is couched in a &s;hort &s;aying, ob&s;cure and ambiguous, it is called a RIDDLE. When it is couched in a &s;hort &s;ay|ing commonly u&s;ed, it is termed a PROVERB. When the metaphoric repre&s;entation is delivered in form of a hi&s;tory, it is a PARABLE. 2. Becau&s;e every thing has various qualities and operations, one thing may be the metaphorical emblem of per&s;ons or things different, or contrary: &s;o a LION is the emblem of God, of Chri&s;t, of Satan, and of men, good and bad. 3. The diffe|rence between the emblem, and the object of the meta|phor; that is, between that from which the metaphor is drawn, and that which it exhibits, renders it impo&s;|&s;ible for any metaphor fully to repre&s;ent its object, and ab&s;urd to expect, that an univer&s;al &s;imilitude betwixt the emblem and the object &s;hould ever be found. 4. Hence it &s;ollows, that to &s;queeze metaphors, by run|ning the parallel further than truth and decency, with re&s;pect to the emblem and object, will admit, is not to illu&s;trate, but to di&s;credit and darken the my&s;teries of God. 5. Nay, in the &s;acred metaphors, one particular is generally the <HI>principal</HI> thing thereby exhibited. THIS, by the attentive reader or preacher, &s;hould, from the circum&s;tances of the text or context, be e&s;pecially enquired after, and con&s;idered</P>

<P N="2">2. She is compared to a HUMAN BODY, or WOMAN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Song i. 5. 8. 9. 10. 11. 13. and iv. 1.&mdash;5. and vi. 5. 6. 7. and vii. 1.&mdash;5. and v. 2. Rev. xii. 1.</NOTE>. She is united to Je&s;us as her Lord and head, whence her honour, her laws, her ordinances, her nouri&s;hment and life are derived. She con&s;i&s;ts of innumerable members, all clo&s;ely connected with him, and with one another; who feel one another's affliction, &s;ympathize with one another's infirmities, care for one another's welfare, and are in con&s;tant readine&s;s to &s;erve one another.

<P N="10">10. Antichri&s;t is compared to a BEAST <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rev. xiii.</NOTE>. What &s;tupidity, ab&s;urdity, and ignorance, prevail in his doc|trines, laws, and members! Its <HI>ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea,</HI> imports his obtaining of power amid&s;t times of trouble, confu&s;ion, perplexity; and over multitudes of un&s;ettled &s;ubjects of the Roman empire. Its <HI>&s;even heads,</HI> &s;ignify &s;even forms of government u&s;ed at Rome, and i&s;&s;uing and concentering in the Papacy. Its <HI>ten horns,</HI> are the ten kingdoms &s;ubject to Popery. <HI>Names of bla&s;phemy in the forehead,</HI> imply open reviling of God and his truths; and of Chri&s;t, in his office and work. Its <HI>feet of a bear,</HI> imply exce&s;&s;ive cruelty; firm retention of votaries; and outrageous murder of men, in their &s;oul, body, and name. Its <HI>appearance of a leopard,</HI> imports craft, cruelty, and being &s;potted with abominations un|numbered. Its <HI>mouth of a lion,</HI> imports the roaring

forth of frightful threatenings; and the powerful exer|ci&s;e of devouring influence. The <HI>healing of one of its wounded heads,</HI> implies the re&s;toration of power to the city of Rome in the per&s;on of the Pope, after the He|ruli and others extirpated the imperial; or the re&s;toring to him the power which he lo&s;t at the Prote&s;tant refor|mation. This fir&s;t bea&s;t repre&s;ents Antichri&s;t in his civil influence. His <HI>ri&s;ing from the earth in form of an|other bea&s;t,</HI> may denote the ri&s;e of his power eccle&s;ia&s;tic, from ob&s;curity, by carnal means, and to promote earth|ly and carnal ends. Its <HI>being like a lamb,</HI> imports his pretence to innocency, purity, and u&s;efulne&s;s; and his u&s;urpation of Chri&s;t's office as a Surety and Prie&s;t. Its <HI>two horns,</HI> denote his connected civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tic power and authority; or his power of order and doc|trine, bniding and loo&s;ing, in the church. Its <HI>&s;peaking like a dragon,</HI> imports his terrible cur&s;es, cen&s;ures, ex|communications, and interdicts again&s;t his oppo&s;ers. <HI>His cau&s;ing men to make and wor&s;hip an image of the fir&s;t bea&s;t,</HI> may &s;ignify his obliging them to reverence the poor &s;hadow of authority re&s;tored to Rome by the Popi&s;h clergy. His <HI>mark in mens hands,</HI> implies their &s;wearing to, or practi&s;ing his abominations. His <HI>mark on their foreheads,</HI> implies their bold and daring profe&s;&s;ion of his errors, idolatry, and &s;uper&s;tition. <HI>Six hundred three|&s;core and &s;ix, the number of his name,</HI> marks out the Latin church, who&s;e Latin &s;ervice was appointed in A.

<HEAD>SECT I. FIRST <HI>Metaphors re&s;pecting nations more generally con&s;idered.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ALL nations are repre&s;ented as the TWO SONS of a family <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxi 28.&mdash;32. Luke. xv. 11. 32.</NOTE>. The Jews are the ELDER, the Gentiles the YOUNGER. The former, God, by his word, required to <HI>work in the vineyard</HI> of his church. Fairly they engaged, and readily they promi&s;ed, to &s;erve him; but quickly broke their engagement. Long the latter lived in open rebellion; but, at la&s;t, influenced by his con|verting grace, they repented and complied with his call. Long, like prodigals, they de&s;erted their Father's fa|mily and church, till deep &s;en&s;e of their &s;piritual need brought them to them&s;elves, and made them enquire what they &s;hould do to be &s;ayed. How readily then did JEHOVAH meet them in mercy! embraced them with love! arrayed them with the <HI>be&s;t robe</HI> of his &s;ons righ|teou&s;ne&s;s! fea&s;ted them with his fle&s;h and blood! adorn|ed them with his ordinances and influences! But why, ye Jews, did you repine at his honouring them above you, who had long been his peculiar children and &s;er|vants! Was it not meet, that there &s;hould be an abun|dant di&s;play of heavenly bounty and gladne&s;s, when God's &s;o-long <HI>lo&s;t children were found?</HI> when your &s;o|long <HI>dead brethren were made alive?&mdash;</HI>Rejoice ye Gen|tiles, with his people, for to him we &s;eek; in him we tru&s;t; and his re&s;t &s;hall be glorious.</P>
<P N="2">2. All nations are compared to the SMALL DROP of a bucket, DUST <HI>of the balance,</HI> and NOTHING before God <HI>(a).</HI> How &s;mall, in&s;ignificant, un&s;ub&s;tantial, <HI>(b)</HI> I&s;. xl. 15. 17.

<P N="3">3. The Gentile nations, before the &s;pread of the go|&s;pel, are called a LITTLE SISTER <HI>without brea&s;ts</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Song viii. 8.</NOTE>. Though many of their progeny were cho&s;en by, and in the purpo&s;e of God united to Chri&s;t; yet they made no appearance as a church, had no brea&s;ts of in&s;pired ora|cles, DIVine ordinances, or go&s;pel-mini&s;ters, wherewith to edify the &s;ouls of men.</P>
<P N="4">4. Perhaps the Gentile nations are compared to a BARREN, DESOLATE, and <HI>refu&s;ed</HI> WOMAN <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">I&s;. liv. 1. 4. 6. and lv. 1.</NOTE>. And they are called a NATION which <HI>Chri&s;t knew not.</HI> Before his death, they, for many ages, produced almo&s;t no children to him. They were de&s;erted and rejected by him. He took no peculiar notice of them; brought them into no church-relation to him. But, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, more have now been the &s;piritual children of this barren wo|man, than ever were of the Jewi&s;h church.&mdash;But perhaps this <HI>barren woman,</HI> &s;ignifies the church during Chri&s;t's per&s;onal pre&s;ence with her on earth. And the <HI>children of the de&s;olate being more than they of the married wife,</HI> Implies, that after Chri&s;t's withdrawment to heaven, the converts to him &s;hould be mo&s;t numerous.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Gentiles, before the &s;pread of the go&s;pel a|mong them, are called FOREIGNERS <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 20.</NOTE>. They were without vi&s;ible intere&s;t in, or connection with God in Chri&s;t; and de&s;titute of the offers of his grace, the doc|trines of his word, or the laws of his kingdom. They had no &s;piritual fellow&s;hip with his holy nation; no claim to his covenants of promi&s;e; no hope of a Me&s;|&s;iah, or &s;alvation by him, or of a re&s;urrection to eternal life; but were de&s;titute of the knowledge, the image, the fear, the wor&s;hip, and &s;aving fellow&s;hip of God.

<HEAD>Metaphors re&s;pecting the go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE di&s;pen&s;ation of God's grace, e&s;pecially under the New Te&s;tament, is called the KING|DOM OF GOD; the KINGDOM OF HEAVEN <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mark i. 14. and Matth. xx. 1.</NOTE>. O the maje&s;tic &s;overeignty, &s;tate, and royalty of God therein manife&s;ted! O its beautiful order, &s;trength, and dura|tion! and the honourable privileges therein conferred! What multitudes are thereby connected, and united un|der Je&s;us their head! God is the devi&s;er, the e&s;tabli&s;her, the manager, and his glory the end of it. It is heaven|ly in its origin; it re&s;embles heaven in holine&s;s, come|line&s;s, and order; and prepares men for entrance into the heavenly inheritance of the &s;aints in light. The New Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation is more God-like and heavenly than the Old; holine&s;s is the univer&s;al <HI>law of the hou&s;e;</HI> and its privileges are more &s;piritual and &s;anctifying.</P>
<P N="2">2. The go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation in the apo&s;tolic age is re|pre&s;ented as a MARRIAGE-DINNER; and that chiefly in the glorious Millennium, is called the MARRIAGE SUPPER <HI>of the Lamb</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxii. 1.&mdash;14. Luke xiv. 15.&mdash;24. Rev. xix. 7.&mdash;9. Matth. viii. 11. 12.</NOTE>. The former is indeed towards the end of time, but nearer its middle than the other, which &s;hall but take place before the la&s;t judgment. God hath <HI>killed his oxen and &s;atlings;</HI> hath &s;lain his own Son, to he our provi&s;ion; hath prepared all po&s;&s;ible ble&s;&s;ings; and invites every &s;ort of &s;inners to e&s;pou&s;e his Son, and accept of his fulne&s;s. From trifling and carnal motives, the Jews, when fir&s;t invited, refu&s;ed to receive this mer|cy and favour; For this they were excluded from the church, and the ordinances thereof; them&s;elves ma&s;&s;ac|red by the murdering Romans, and by one another; and their city burnt with fire. But thrice happy! God extended his invitations to the de&s;titute, the wicked, and infamous Gentiles, in what&s;oever city or nation they are found! O now our rich provi&s;ion! our amazing
<PB N="319" REF="323">
joy and happine&s;s! our honourable fellow&s;hip with God, Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t; with angels, ancient patriarchs, and eminent &s;aints, while the Jewi&s;h <HI>chil|dren of the kingdom</HI> are ca&s;t out! How fitly our enter|tainment prepareth us for our work in the end of the world! qualifieth us to lie down in our du&s;ty beds of the grave! and to enter into our eternal re&s;t! How great JEHOVAH's earne&s;tne&s;s to have his hou&s;e filled with de|&s;titute &s;inners! Upon his invitations what multitudes have entered, and <HI>yet there is room.</HI> By &s;etting before us the &s;infulne&s;s and mi&s;ery of our natural &s;tate, Je&s;us' excellency, ability, and readine&s;s to &s;ave, and u&s;ing eve|ry method to per&s;uade our con&s;cience, he requires his mini&s;terial &s;ervants <HI>to compel</HI> us to come in, that his hou&s;e may be filled. But dreadful &s;hall be our endle&s;s mi&s;ery, if we live in his church, without putting on his Son, as our <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;anctification!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is repre&s;ented as the <HI>letting out of a vineyard to hu&s;bandmen</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxi. 33.&mdash;43.</NOTE>. In the ceremonial form thereof, God gave it to the Jews, and &s;ent his prophets to demand, that they &s;hould give him the glory due to his name; the&s;e being injuriou&s;ly maltreated, he &s;ent his Son, whom, it might have been expected, they would reverence and regard; but they murdered him, that they might live as they li&s;ted. For the&s;e things God mi&s;erably de&s;troy|ed the Jewi&s;h nation, and gave the go&s;pel to the Gen|tiles, that they might bring forth fruits of good works, an&s;werable to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is compared to the <HI>hiring of labourers at differ|ent hours, to work in a vineyard, and giving all equal wages</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xx. 1.&mdash;16.</NOTE>. In the morning of the patriarchal, in the noon-tide of the ceremonial, at the <HI>ninth hour</HI> of the apo&s;tolic age, in the <HI>eleventh hour</HI> of the future Millen|nium, or thou&s;and years reign of the &s;aints, multitudes are DIVinely invited, and brought to Chri&s;t, and to his work in the church. Nor &s;hall the eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the former exceed that of the latter. Murmur not, ye Jews, <HI>who bore the burden</HI> of eremonial rites, <HI>and the heat</HI> of laborious &s;ervice; murmur not, ye primitive Chri&s;ti|ans, who <HI>bore the burden</HI> of trouble&s;ome work, and <HI>the heat</HI> of &s;corching per&s;ecution; may not JEHOVAH do with
<PB N="320" REF="324">
his own as he plea&s;eth? Is not the whole reward of &s;o|vereign grace? Let not your eye be evil, becau&s;e his is good. In the early morning of life, are not &s;ome; in its middle or noon are not others; in its evening of old age, are not others, though more rarely, called and drawn to Chri&s;t? May not a &s;overeign God impart to all an equal &s;hare of his endle&s;s bli&s;s; his gracious reward?</P>
<P N="5">5. It is compared to a <HI>great man's giving pounds or talents to his &s;ervants, as he departs to a far country, that they may occupy till he return, call them to an ac|count, and render them rewards, according to their re|&s;pective improvement</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 14.&mdash;30. Luke xix 11.&mdash;27.</NOTE>. A&s;cending up on high, to receive for him&s;elf a kingdom, Je&s;us committed to men, the precious and u&s;eful <HI>pounds</HI> and <HI>talents</HI> of DIVine &s;crip|tures, of go&s;pel ordinances, of manifold opportunities of grace and happine&s;s, of holy offices, gifts, and gra|ces; to &s;ome in a greater, to others in a le&s;&s;er degree. The&s;e he requires them to improve, <HI>alway abounding in the work of the Lord.</HI> At the end, he will come, and reckon with them. Such as having real grace, have improven their talents, &s;hall be highly and proportion|ally rewarded with everla&s;ting honour and joy. Such as, having no real grace, through hard thoughts of Je|&s;us, have not improved their gifts, offices, and oppor|tunities, &s;hall be &s;elf-condemned, and ca&s;t into endle&s;s mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the end of the world, it is like to <HI>the calling of wi&s;e and fooli&s;h virgins to meet the Bridegroom</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 1.&mdash;13.</NOTE>. Though, church-members be like virgins in outward purity, in blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s of life, and &s;oundne&s;s of princi|ple, and in apparent mode&s;ty, and &s;elf-denial; yet alas how many of them are not <HI>wi&s;e unto &s;alvation!</HI> What multitudes fooli&s;hly name the name of Chri&s;t, without receiving him into their heart! At the end of time, how dreadful &s;hall be the &s;loth and &s;ecurity, of both &s;aints and hypocrites! Ere they are aware, Chri&s;t &s;hall &s;um|mon them to judgment. Happy then, tho&s;e, who have <HI>oil</HI> of true grace, attending their lamps of profe&s;&s;ion! their glory &s;hall be brightne&s;s; their lamps trimmed; their grace perfected; and them&s;elves &s;hall enter into

immediate and everla&s;ting fellow&s;hip with Chri&s;t! but oh unhappy the&s;e, who have lamps, but no &s;aving grace! None can then be given them; no creature &s;hall be able or willing to help them. They &s;hall be irrever&s;ibly ex|cluded from the fellow&s;hip of Chri&s;t; and &s;hut up in everla&s;ting torments, where there &s;hall be <HI>weeping, wailing, and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The go&s;pel-&s;tate of the New-Te&s;tament church is repre&s;ented as a REST <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Heb. iv. 3.</NOTE>. How fully is our free and complete ju&s;tification through the blood of Je&s;us therein di&s;played! and how powerfully applied! how happily we are therein liberated from that &s;ervile frame of &s;pirit, which was &s;o common to the Jews, in their wor&s;hip! The yoke of trouble&s;ome ceremonies is no more impo|&s;ed; nor is our con&s;cience burdened or perplexed, con|cerning the punctual ob&s;ervance thereof. But the &s;pi|ritual and ea&s;y in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel, attended with gracious freedom, &s;trength, and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, are come in their room. Ble&s;&s;ed re&s;t of heaven! ble&s;&s;ed form of wor|&s;hip, never to be changed in time, and wherein JEHO|VAH manife&s;ts his re&s;t in Chri&s;t, and in his love to|wards us!</P>

If burdens be impo&s;ed, if plowers plow upon my back, it is the grief, the load which the Lord hath appointed me: let me therefore patiently bear it; be dumb becau&s;e he doth it.

<P N="40">40. The afflictions of Chri&s;t and his people are called their BAPTISM <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Matth. xx. 22. 23.</NOTE>.

<P N="43">43. The overthrow of a nation or church is likened to an HARVEST and VINTAGE <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Joel iii. 13. Rev. xiv. 15. 20.</NOTE>. Men being ripe in, and having filled up the whole mea&s;ure of iniquity, which DIVine patience intended to bear with, God cuts
