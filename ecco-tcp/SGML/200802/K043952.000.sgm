<P>THIS little Piece was written above three Years &s;ince, and acted for my Benefit.&mdash;The la&s;t Scene was an Addition the Year after. Whatever Faults are in it, I hope, will be pardoned, when I in|form the Public, I had at fir&s;t no De&s;ign of printing it; and do it now at the Re|que&s;t of my Friends, who (as it met with &s;o much Indulgence from the Audience) thought it might give &s;ome Plea&s;ure in the reading.&mdash;The Songs were written by a Gentleman.</P>
<P>I take this Opportunity to a&s;&s;ure the Public, I am, with great Gratitude and Re&s;pect,</P>

<SPEAKER>GATTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>_WELL, I believe we are at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t melancholy Family in Town, that us'd to be the mer|rie&s;t. Since the&s;e Devils, the Mu|&s;es, (as my Lady calls 'em) have got into the Hou&s;e, they have turn'd her Head, and &s;he di&s;tracts every body about her. She really was once a &s;weet|temper'd Woman; but now I can't &s;peak, or &s;tir, but &s;he flies at me, and &s;ays I have flurried her out of one of the fine&s;t Thoughts!&mdash;Hang her! I wi&s;h her Farce may be hi&s;s'd off the Stage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>TOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's but a fooli&s;h kind of Wi&s;h; for if &s;he's &s;o &s;weet-temper'd now, what do you think &s;he'll be then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GATTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't care what &s;he'll be; for I'm determin'd not to &s;tay with her. I am &s;ure &s;he u&s;es me like her Dog.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does &s;he?&mdash;Then you are an ungrateful Hu&s;|&s;ey to complain: for &s;he is fonder of that than ever &s;he was of her Hu&s;band.&mdash;I fancy this Farce of her's is horrid Stuff: for I ob&s;erve, all her Vi|&s;itors &s;he reads it to (which is indeed every bo|dy that comes to the Hou&s;e) whi&s;per as they come down Stairs, and laugh ready to kill them&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GATTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but that's at her A&s;&s;urance. Why, do you know 'tis none of her own? a Gentleman only lent it her to read; he has been ill a great while at <HI>Bath;</HI> &s;o &s;he has taken the Advantage of that, made &s;ome little Alterations, had it &s;et to Mu&s;ic, and has introduc'd it to the Stage as a Performance of her own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear Mr. <HI>Surly,</HI> that every body thought &s;he was going to be married to, is &s;o enrag'd at her, that he'll never &s;peak to her, or &s;ee her again. One of his Footmen told me of it ye&s;terday, as a great Secret, &s;o I promis'd him never to mention it.&mdash;Don't you hear her Bell ring?</P>

<P>As fa&s;t as you could! why, you move like a Snail that has been trod upon, you creeping Crea|ture.&mdash;Let me die, but &s;he has provok'd me into a fine Simile. Come, get the Things to dre&s;s me in&s;tantaneou&s;ly. <STAGE><HI>(Tom</HI> with Tea and Coffee.

<P>Well, do you know I have had &s;uch a Quarrel with <HI>Frank Surly</HI> upon your Account? We met la&s;t Night at Lady <HI>Betty Brag</HI>'s Rout;&mdash;there was a va&s;t deal of Company,&mdash;and they were all talking of your new Piece.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HAZARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, I &s;uppo&s;e I was finely worried.</P>

Oh, thinks I, my dear, you're in a fine Humour to make us &s;ome Diver&s;ion. So, &s;ays I, <HI>Frank,</HI> I hear the Match is quite concluded between Mrs. <HI>Hazard</HI> and you; and that &s;he has fix'd the fir&s;t Night of her Comedy for your Wedding-Night.&mdash;Sir, &s;ays he, (with a very grave Face) you may &s;ay what you plea&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Hazard;</HI> for as &s;he's going to expo&s;e her|&s;elf, &s;he mu&s;t expect that every Fool will be as impertinent as &s;he is ridiculous:&mdash;but I would advi&s;e you not to mention my Name any more

in that Manner, for, if you do, I &s;hall take it extremely ill. Lord! &s;ays Mi&s;s <HI>Giggle,</HI> Mr. <HI>Surly,</HI> how can you be &s;o cro&s;s? expo&s;e her&s;elf!&mdash;I'll &s;wear, I believe Mrs. <HI>Hazard</HI> can write a very pretty Play, for &s;he has a great deal of Wit and Humour.&mdash;Wit and Humour! &s;ays he, why there are not ten Women in the Creation that have Sen&s;e enough to write a con&s;i&s;tent <HI>N.

<P>Why &s;ome time next Week; this is to be the la&s;t Rehear&s;al: and the Managers have promis'd they &s;hall all be dre&s;s'd, that we may &s;ee exact|ly what Effect it will have.</P>

<P>Not in the lea&s;t; the Town never hi&s;s any Thing that is introduc'd to them, by a Per&s;on of Con&s;e|quence and Breeding. Becau&s;e they are &s;ure they'll have nothing low.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HAZARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha!&mdash;Why perhaps they mayn't find out one &s;o &s;oon as t'other. Ha, ha, ha, well, let me die if that is not a very good Thing.&mdash;But 'tis well for me, <HI>Witling,</HI> the Town don't hear me; not that I mean quite what I &s;ay neither, for to do them Ju&s;tice, they're generally in the right in their Cen&s;ure; tho' &s;ometimes indeed they will out of Humanity for|give an Author Stupidity, and overlook his being a Fool; provided he will do them the Favour not to be a Bea&s;t; for which Rea&s;on, <HI>Witling,</HI> I have taken great Care to be delicate; I may be dull, but I am delicate; &s;o that I am not at all afraid of the Town: I wi&s;h I could &s;ay the &s;ame of the Per|formers: Lord, what pity 'tis the great Tragedy Actors can't &s;ing! I'm about a new Thing, which I &s;hall call a Burletto, which I take from &s;ome In|cidents in <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> that I believe will be as high Humour, as was ever brought upon the Stage.

<P>Don't you think <HI>Barry</HI> wou'd be a better! he's &s;o tall you know, and &s;o finely made for't. If I was to advi&s;e, I would carry that to <HI>Covent-Garden.</HI></P>

<P>Bad Air!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HAZARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; the Actors can't play there above three Days a Week. They have more need of a Phy&s;ician, than a Poet, at that Hou&s;e.</P>

<P>Pray how many Characters have you in this Thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HAZARD.</SPEAKER>

<P>And who is to act that, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HAZARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Mrs. <HI>Clive</HI> to be &s;ure; tho' I wi&s;h &s;he don't &s;poil it; for &s;he's &s;o conceited, and in&s;olent, that &s;he won't let me teach it her. You mu&s;t know when I told her I had a Part for her in a Performance of mine, in the prettie&s;t manner I was able, (for one mu&s;t be civil to the&s;e &s;ort of People when one wants them) &s;ays &s;he, Indeed, Madam, I mu&s;t &s;ee the whole Piece, for I &s;hall take no Part in a new Thing, without chu&s;ing that which I think I can

act be&s;t. I have been a great Sufferer already, by the Manager's not doing Ju&s;tice to my Genius; but I hope I &s;hall next Year convince the Town, what fine Judgment they have: for I intend to play a capital Tragedy Part for my own Benefit.</P>

<SPEAKER>WITLING.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I think the Town will be va&s;tly oblig'd to you, for giving them &s;uch an Entertainment, as I am told it is from every body that has heard it; tho' the ill&mdash;natur'd Part of your Acquaintance &s;ay 'tis none of your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HAZARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why who&s;e do they &s;ay it is, pray?&mdash;Not yours, <HI>Witling;</HI> not quite &s;o bad as that I hope. No, my Motive for writing, was really Compa&s;&s;ion; the Town has been &s;o overwhelmed with Tragedies late|ly, that they are in one entire Fit of the Vapours.&mdash;They think they love 'em, but it's no &s;uch Thing. I was there one Night this Sea&s;on at a Tragedy, and there was &s;uch an univer&s;al Yawn in the Hou&s;e, that, if it had not been for a great Quantity of Drums and Trumpets, that mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly every now and then came in to their Relief, the whole Audience would have fallen a&s;leep.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ALBANY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay, Madam, will you give me Leave, as you're going to entertain the Town, (that is, I mean, to endea|vour, or to attempt to entertain them) for let me tell you, fair Lady, 'tis not an ea&s;y thing to bring about. If Men, who are properly graduated in Learning, who have &s;wallow'd the Tincture of a polite Educa|tion, who, as I may &s;ay, are Hand and Glove with the Cla&s;&s;ics, if &s;uch Genius's as I'm de&s;cribing, fail of Succe&s;s in Dramatical Occurrences, or Performances, ('tis the &s;ame Sen&s;e in the Latin) what mu&s;t a poor Lady expect, who is ignorant as the Dirt?</P>

<P>Oh Sir <HI>Albany,</HI> I'll an&s;wer &s;he has taken Care of Time and Place; for it will begin about half an Hour after eight; and be acted at <HI>Drury-lane</HI> Theatre.&mdash;Ha, ha, ha, there's Time and Place for you.</P>

<P>And &s;o, you're Hand and Glove with the Cla&s;&s;ics, are you? Why thou elaborate Idiot, how dur&s;t you venture to talk to any thing that's Rational?&mdash;Con|&s;ult my Male Acquaintance! I thank my Stars, thou art not one of 'em. Where did you pick up this Creature?&mdash;what's his Name?&mdash;Can you &s;pell your own Name, you ugly Brute?</P>

<P>Indeed I am, <HI>Witling,</HI> and very angry too; I don't believe I &s;hall ever &s;peak to you again.
