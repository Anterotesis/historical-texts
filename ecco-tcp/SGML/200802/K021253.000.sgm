<HEAD>PROLOGUE. SPOKEN BY MR. REDDISH.</HEAD>
<L>CRITICS, hark forward! noble game and new;</L>
<L>A fine We&s;t Indian &s;tarted full in view:</L>
<L>Hot as the &s;oil, the clime, which gave him birth,</L>
<L>You'll run him on a burning &s;cent to earth;</L>
<L>Yet don't devour him in his hiding place,</L>
<L>Bag him, he'll &s;erve you for another chace;</L>
<L>For &s;ure that country has no feeble claim,</L>
<L>Which &s;wells your commerce, and &s;upports your fame.</L>
<L>And in this humble &s;ketch, we hope you'll find,</L>
<L>Some emanations of a noble mind;</L>
<L>Some little touches, which, tho' void of art,</L>
<L>May find perhaps their way into the heart.</L>
<L>Another hero your excu&s;e implores,</L>
<L>Sent by your &s;i&s;ter kingdom to your &s;hores;</L>
<L>Doom'd by Religion's too &s;evere command,</L>
<L>To fight for bread again&s;t his native land:</L>
<L>A brave, unthinking, animated rogue,</L>
<L>With here and there a touch upon the brogue;</L>
<L>Laugh, but de&s;pi&s;e him not, for on his lip</L>
<L>His errors lie; his heart can never trip.</L>
<L>Others there are&mdash;&mdash;but may we not prevail</L>
<L>To let the gentry tell their own plain tale?</L>
<L>Shall they come in? They'll plea&s;e you, if they can;</L>
<L>If not, condemn the bard&mdash;&mdash;but &s;pare the <HI>Man.</HI></L>
<L>For &s;peak, think, act, or write in angry times,</L>
<L>A wi&s;h to plea&s;e is made the wor&s;t of crimes;</L>
<L>Dire &s;lander now with black envenom'd dart,</L>
<L>Stands ever arm'd to &s;tab you to the heart.</L>
<L><PB REF="3">Rou&s;e, Britons, rou&s;e, for honour of your i&s;le,</L>
<L>Your old good humour; and be &s;een to &s;mile.</L>
<L>You &s;ay we write not like our fathers&mdash;true,</L>
<L>Nor were our fathers half &s;o &s;trict as you,</L>
<L>Damn'd not each error of the poets pen,</L>
<L>But judging man, remember'd they were men.</L>
<L>Aw'd into &s;ilence by the times abu&s;e,</L>

<L>High on Parna&s;&s;us' lofty &s;ummit &s;tands</L>
<L>The immortal camp; there lie the cho&s;en bands!</L>
<L>But give fair quarter to us puny elves,</L>
<L>The giants then will &s;ally forth them&s;elves;</L>

<STAGE>In an inner room, &s;et off by gla&s;s doors, are di&s;covered &s;everal clerks, employed at their de&s;ks. A writing table in the front room. <HI>STOCKWELL</HI> is di&s;covered reading a letter; <HI>STUKELY</HI> comes gently out of the back room, and ob&s;erves him &s;ome time before he &s;peaks.</STAGE>

<P>HE &s;eems di&s;ordered: &s;ome thing in that letter; and I'm afraid of an unplea&s;ant &s;ort. He has many ventures of great account at &s;ea; a &s;hip richly freighted for Barcelona; another for Li&s;bon; and others expected from Cadiz of &s;till greater value. Be&s;ides the&s;e, I know he has many deep concerns in foreign bottoms, and under-writings to a va&s;t amount. I'll acco&s;t him. Sir! Mr. Stockwell!</P>

<P>Stukely!&mdash;Well, have you &s;hip'd the cloths?</P>

<P>I have, Sir; here's the bill of lading, and copy of the invoice: the a&s;&s;ortments are all compared: Mr. Traffick will give you the policy upon Change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very well; lay the&s;e papers by; and no more of bu&s;ine&s;s for a while. Shut the door Stukely; I have had long proof of your friend&s;hip and fidelity to me; a
<PB N="2" REF="6">
matter of mo&s;t intimate concern lies on my mind, and, 'twill be a &s;en&s;ible relief to unbo&s;om my&s;elf to you; I have ju&s;t now been informed of the arrival of the young We&s;t Indian, I have &s;o long been expecting; you know who I mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; Mr. Belcour, the young gentleman, who inherited old Belcour's great e&s;tates in Jamaica.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hu&s;h, not &s;o loud; come a little nearer this way. This Belcour is now in London; part of his baggage is already arrived; and I expect him every minute. Is it to be wonder'd at, if his coming throws me into &s;ome agitation, when I tell you, Stukely, he is my &s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;on</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, my only &s;on; early in life I accompanied his grandfather to Jamaica as his clerk; he had an only daughter, &s;omewhat older than my&s;elf; the mother of this gentleman; it was my chance (call it good or ill) to engage her affections: and, as the inferiority of my condition made it hopele&s;s to expect her father's con|&s;ent; her fondne&s;s provided an expedient, and we were privately married; the i&s;&s;ue of that concealed engage|ment is, as I have told you, this Belcour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That event, &s;urely, di&s;covered your connexion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;hall hear. Not many days after our marriage old Belcour &s;et out for England; and, during his abode here, my wife was, with great &s;ecre&s;y, delivered of this &s;on. Fruitful in expedients to di&s;gui&s;e her &s;ituation, without parting from her infant, &s;he contrived to have it laid and received at her door as a foundling. After &s;ome time her father returned, having left me here; in one of tho&s;e favourable moments, that decide the for|tunes of pro&s;perous men, this child was introduced; from that in&s;tant, he treated him as his own, gave him his name, and brought him up in his family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="7">
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you never reveal this &s;ecret, either to old Belcour, or your &s;on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUCKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therein you &s;urpri&s;e me; a merchant of your emi|nence, and a member of the Briti&s;h parliament, might &s;urely a&s;pire without offence to the daughter of a planter. In this ca&s;e too, natural affection would prompt to a di&s;covery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your remark is obvious; nor could I have per&s;i&s;ted in this painful &s;ilence, but in obedience to the dying in|junctions of a beloved wife. The letter, you found me reading, conveyed tho&s;e injunctions to me; it was dic|tated in her la&s;t illne&s;s, and almo&s;t in the article of death; (you'll &s;pare me the recital of it) &s;he there con|jures me, in terms as &s;olemn, as they are affecting, never to reveal the &s;ecret of our marriage, or withdraw my &s;on, while her father &s;urviv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STUKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But on what motives did your unhappy lady found the&s;e injunctions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Principally, I believe, from apprehen&s;ion on my ac|count, le&s;t old Belcour, on whom at her decea&s;e I wholly depended, &s;hould withdraw his protection: in part from con&s;ideration of his repo&s;e, as well knowing the di&s;covery would deeply affect his &s;pirit, which was haughty, vehement, and unforgiving: and la&s;tly, in re|gard to the intere&s;t of her infant, whom he had warmly adopted; and for whom, in ca&s;e of a di&s;covery, every thing was to be dreaded from his re&s;entment. And, indeed, though the alteration in my condition might. have ju&s;tified me in di&s;covering my&s;elf, yet I always thought my &s;on &s;afer in tru&s;ting to the caprice than to the ju&s;tice of his grand-father. My judgment has not &s;uffered by the event; old Belcour is dead, and has be|queathed his whole e&s;tate to him we are &s;peaking of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>STUCKELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now then you are no longer bound to &s;ecrecy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STOCKWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but before I publickly reveal my&s;elf, I could wi&s;h to make &s;ome experiment of my &s;on's di&s;po&s;ition; this can be only done by letting his &s;pirit take its cour&s;e without re&s;traint; by the&s;e means, I think I &s;hall di&s;|cover much more of his real character under the title of his merchant, than I &s;hould under that of his father.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mi&s;s Ru&s;port, I de&s;ire to hear no more of Captain Dudley and his de&s;titute family: not a &s;hilling of mine &s;hall ever cro&s;s the hands of any of them: becau&s;e my &s;i&s;ter cho&s;e to marry a beggar, am I bound to &s;upport him and his po&s;terity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You think I am; and pray where do you find the law that tells you &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="14">
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not proficient enough to quote chapter and ver&s;e; but I take charity to be a main clau&s;e in the great &s;tatute of chri&s;tianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ay charity, indeed! And pray, Mi&s;s, are you &s;ure that it is charity, pure charity, which moves you to plead for Captain Dudley? Among&s;t all your pity, do you find no &s;pice of a certain anti-&s;piritual pa&s;&s;ion, called love? Don't mi&s;take your&s;elf, you are no &s;aint, child, believe me; and, I am apt to think, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of old Dudley, and of his daughter into the bargain, would never break your heart, if there was not a certain young fellow of two and twenty in the ca&s;e; who, by the happy recom|mendation of a good per&s;on, and the brilliant appoint|ments of an en&s;igncy, will, if I am not mi&s;taken, cozen you out of a fortune of twice twenty thou&s;and pounds, as &s;oon as ever you are of age to be&s;tow it upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A nephew of your lady&s;hip's can never want any other recommendation with me; and, if my partiality for Charles Dudley is acquitted by the re&s;t of the world, I hope Lady Ru&s;port will not condemn me for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I condemn you! I thank Heaven, Mi&s;s Ru&s;port, I am no ways re&s;pon&s;ible for your conduct; nor is it any concern of mine how you di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf; you are not my daughter; and, when I married your father, poor Sir Stephen Ru&s;port, I found you a forward &s;poiled Mi&s;s of fourteen far above being in&s;tructed by me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps your lady&s;hip calls this in&s;truction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're &s;trangely pert; but 'tis no wonder: your mo|ther, I'm told, was a fine lady; and according to the modern &s;tile of education you was brought up. It was not &s;o in my young days; there was then &s;ome decorum in the world, &s;ome &s;ubordination, as the great Locke ex|pre&s;&s;es it. Oh! 'twas an edifying &s;ight, to &s;ee the re|gular deportment ob&s;erved in our family: no gigling, no go&s;&s;iping was going on there; my good father, Sir Oliver Roundhead, never was &s;een to laugh him&s;elf, nor ever allowed it in his children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="15">
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; tho&s;e were happy times, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, in this forward age, we have coquets in the egg|&s;hell, and philo&s;ophers in the cradle; girls of fifteen that lead the fa&s;hion in new caps and new opinions, that have their &s;entiments and their &s;en&s;ations, and the idle fops encourage 'em in it O' my con&s;cience, I wonder what it is the men can &s;ee in &s;uch babies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam; but all men do not overlook the ma|turer beauties of your lady&s;hip's age, witne&s;s your ad|mirer Major Dennis O'Flaherty; there's an example of &s;ome di&s;cernment; I declare to you, when your lady&s;hip is by, the Major takes no more notice of me than if I was part of the furniture of your chamber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The major, child, has travelled through various king|doms and climates, and has more enlarged notions of fe|male merit than falls to the lot of an Engli&s;h home-bred lover; in mo&s;t other countries, no woman on your &s;ide forty would ever be named in a polite circle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Madam; I've been told that in Vienna they have coquets upon crutches and Venu&s;es in their grand climateric; a lover there celebrates the wrinkles, not the dimples, in his mi&s;tre&s;s's face. The Major, I think, has &s;erved in the imperial army.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LADY RUSPORT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you piqu'd, my young Madam? Had my &s;i&s;ter Loui&s;a now yielded to the addre&s;&s;es of one of Major O'Flaherty's per&s;on and appearance, &s;he would have had &s;ome excu&s;e; but to run away, as &s;he did, at the age of &s;ixteen too, with a man of old Dudley's &s;ort&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was, in my opinion, the mo&s;t venial tre&s;pa&s;s that ever girl of &s;ixteen committed; of a noble family, an engaging per&s;on, &s;trict honour, and &s;ound under&s;tanding, what ac|compli&s;hment was there wanting in Captain Dudley, but that which the prodigality of his ance&s;tors had deprived him of?</P>
</SP>

<P>Mi&s;s Ru&s;port, I in&s;i&s;t upon your retiring to your apartment; when I want your advice I'll &s;end to you. <STAGE>Exit <HI>CHARLOTTE.</HI></STAGE> So you have put on a red coat too, as well as your father; 'tis plain what value you &s;et upon the good advice Sir Oliver u&s;ed to give you; how often has he caution'd you again&s;t the army?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had it plea&s;ed my grandfather to enable me to have obeyed his caution, I would have done it; but you well know how de&s;titute I am; and 'tis not to be wonder'd at if I prefer the &s;ervice of my king to that of any other ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>Well, well, take your own cour&s;e; 'tis no concern of mine: you never con&s;ulted me.</P>

<P>I frequently wrote to your lady&s;hip, but could obtain no an&s;wer; and, &s;ince my grandfather's death, this is the fir&s;t opportunity I have had of waiting upon you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Fulmer, I have borrow'd a book from your &s;hop; 'tis the &s;ixth volume of my decea&s;ed friend Tri&s;tram: he
<PB N="18" REF="22">
is a flattering writer to us poor &s;oldiers; and the divine &s;tory of Le Fevre, which makes part of this book, in my opinion of it, does honour not to its author only, but to human nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is an author I keep in the way of trade, but one I never reli&s;h'd; he is much too loo&s;e and profligate for my ta&s;te.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DUDLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's being too &s;evere: I hold him to be a morali&s;t in the noble&s;t &s;en&s;e; he plays indeed with the fancy, and &s;ome|times perhaps too wantonly; but while he thus de&s;ignedly ma&s;ks his main attack, he comes at once upon the heart; refines, amends it, &s;oftens it; beats down each &s;elfi&s;h barrier from about it, and opens every &s;luice of pity and benevolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FULMER.</SPEAKER>
<P>We of the catholic per&s;ua&s;ion are not much bound to him.&mdash;Well, Sir, I &s;hall not oppo&s;e your opinion; a fevourite author is like a favourite mi&s;tre&s;s; and there you know, Captain, no man likes to have his ta&s;te arraigned.</P>

La&s;t war I followed the fortunes of the German eagle, in the corps of grenadiers; there I had my belly-full of fighting, and a plentiful &s;carcity of every thing el&s;e. After &s;ix and twenty engagements, great and &s;mall, I went off with this ga&s;h on my &s;cull, and a ki&s;s of the empre&s;s queen's &s;weet hand, (Heaven ble&s;s it) for my pains: &s;ince the peace, my dear, I took a little turn with the Confederates there in Poland&mdash;but &s;uch another &s;et of madcaps!&mdash;by the Lord Harry, I never knew what it was they were &s;cuffling about.</P>
