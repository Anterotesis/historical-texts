<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Am unable to account for the My&s;tery with which the <HI>POEM</HI> I &s;end you has been handed about.&mdash;&mdash;In &s;ome part of Doctor <HI>GOLDSMITH's</HI> Works, he confe&s;&s;es him&s;elf &s;o unable to re&s;i&s;t the hungry Attacks of wretched Compilers, that
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
he contents him&s;elf with the Demand of the fat Man, who, when at Sea, and the Crew in great Want of Provi&s;ions, was pitched on by the Sailors as the pro|pere&s;t Subject to &s;upply their Wants: He found the Nece&s;&s;ity of Acquie&s;cence, at the &s;ame Time making the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Demand of the fir&s;t Cut off him&s;elf for <HI>him&s;elf.</HI> When the Doctor in his Life-time was forced by the&s;e Anthropophagi to &s;uch Capitulations, what Re|&s;pect can we <HI>now</HI> expect from them? will they not dine on his memory? To re&s;cue him from this In&s;ult, I &s;end you an authentic Copy of the la&s;t poetic Pro|duction of this Great and Good Man; of which, I re|commend an early Publication, to prevent &s;purious Edi|tions being u&s;hered into the World. &mdash; <HI>Dr. Gold|&s;mith</HI> belonged to a Club of <HI>Beaux E&s;prits,</HI> where Wit
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
&s;parkled &s;ometimes at the Expence of Good-nature.&mdash; It was propo&s;ed to write Epitaphs on the Doctor; his Country, Dialect and Per&s;on, furni&s;hed Subjects of Wit|tici&s;m. &mdash; The Doctor was called on for <HI>Retaliation,</HI> and at their next Meeting produced the following Poem, which I think adds one Leaf to his immortal Wreath.</P>

<LG>
<L>OF old, when Scarron his companions invited,</L>
<L>Each gue&s;t brought his di&s;h, and the fea&s;t was united;</L>
<L>If our landlord &s;upplies us with beef, and with fi&s;h,</L>
<L>Let each gue&s;t bring him&s;elf, and he brings the be&s;t di&s;h:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="6" MS="y">Our Dean &s;hall be veni&s;on, ju&s;t fre&s;h from the plains;</L>
<L>Our Burke &s;hall be tongue, with a garni&s;h of brains;</L>
<L>Our Will &s;hall be wild fowl, of excellent flavour,</L>
<L>And Dick with his pepper, &s;hall heighten their &s;avour:</L>
<L>Our Cumberland's &s;weet-bread, its place &s;hall obtain,</L>
<L>And Dougla&s;s's pudding, &s;ub&s;tantial and plain:</L>
<L>Our Garrick's a &s;allad, for in him we &s;ee</L>
<L>Oil, vinegar, &s;ugar, and &s;altne&s;s agree:</L>
<L>To make out the dinner, full certain I am,</L>
<L>That Ridge is anchovy, and Reynolds is lamb;</L>
<L>That Hickey's a capon, and by the &s;ame rule,</L>
<L>Magnanimous Gold&s;mith, a goo&s;berry fool:</L>
<L>At a dinner &s;o various, at &s;uch a repa&s;t,</L>
<L>Who'd not be a glutton, and &s;tick to the la&s;t:</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="7" MS="y">Here, waiter, more wine, let me &s;it while I'm able,</L>
<L>'Till all my companions &s;ink under the table;</L>
<L>Then with chaos and blunders encircling my head,</L>
<L>Let me ponder, and tell what I think of the dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here lies the good Dean, re-united to earth,</L>
<L>Who mixt rea&s;on with plea&s;ure, and wi&s;dom with mirth:</L>
<L>If he had any faults, he has left us in doubt,</L>
<L>At lea&s;t, in &s;ix weeks, I could not find 'em out;</L>
<L>Yet &s;ome have declar'd, and it can't be denied 'em,</L>
<L>That &s;ly-boots was cur&s;edly cunning to hide 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here lies our good Edmund, who&s;e genius was &s;uch,</L>
<L>We &s;carcely can prai&s;e it, or blame it too much;</L>
<L>Who, born for the Univer&s;e, narrow'd his mind,</L>
<L>And to party gave up, what was meant for mankind.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="8" MS="y">Tho' fraught with all learning, kept &s;training his throat,</L>
<L>To per&s;uade Tommy Town&s;end to lend him a vote;</L>
<L>Who, too deep for his hearers, &s;till went on refining,</L>
<L>And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining;</L>
<L>Tho' equal to all things, for all things he's fit,</L>
<L>Too nice for a &s;tate&s;man, too proud for a wit:</L>
<L>For a patriot too cool; for a drudge, di&s;obedient,</L>
<L>And too fond of the <HI>right</HI> to pur&s;ue the <HI>expedient.</HI></L>
<L>In &s;hort, 'twas his fate, unemploy'd, or in play, Sir,</L>
<L>To eat mutton cold, and cut blocks with a razor.</L>
<L>Here lies hone&s;t William, who&s;e heart was a mint,</L>
<L>While the owner ne'er knew half the good that was in't;</L>
<L>The pupil of impul&s;e, it forc'd him along,</L>
<L>His conduct &s;till right, with his argument wrong;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="9">Still aiming at honour, yet fearing to roam,</L>
<L>The coachman was tip&s;y, the chariot drove home;</L>
<L>Would you a&s;k for his merits, alas! he had none,</L>
<L>What was good was &s;pontaneous, his faults were his own.</L>
<L>Here lies hone&s;t Richard, who&s;e fate I mu&s;t &s;igh at,</L>
<L>Alas, that &s;uch frolic &s;hould now be &s;o quiet!</L>
<L>What &s;pirits were his, what wit and what whim,</L>
<L>Now breaking a je&s;t, and now breaking a limb;</L>
<L>Now rangling and grumbling to keep up the ball,</L>
<L>Now teazing and vexing, yet laughing at all?</L>
<L>In &s;hort &s;o provoking a Devil was Dick,</L>
<L>That we wi&s;h'd him full ten times a day at Old Nick.</L>
<L>But mi&s;&s;ing his mirth and agreeable vein,</L>
<L>As often we wi&s;h'd to have Dick back again.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="10">Here Cumberland lies having acted his parts,</L>
<L>The Terence of England, the mender of hearts;</L>
<L>A flattering painter, who made it his care</L>
<L>To draw men as they ought to be, not as they are.</L>
<L>His gallants are all faultle&s;s, his women divine,</L>
<L>And comedy wonders at being &s;o fine;</L>
<L>Like a tragedy queen he has dizen'd her out,</L>
<L>Or rather like tragedy giving a rout.</L>
<L>His fools have their follies &s;o left in a croud</L>
<L>Of virtues and feelings, that folly grows proud,</L>
<L>And coxcombs alike in their failings alone,</L>
<L>Adopting his portraits are pleas'd with their own.</L>
<L>Say, where has our poet this malady caught,</L>
<L>Or wherefore his characters thus without fault?</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="11">Say was it that vainly directing his view,</L>
<L>To find out mens virtues and finding them few,</L>
<L>Quite &s;ick of pur&s;uing each trouble&s;ome elf,</L>
<L>He grew lazy at la&s;t and drew from him&s;elf?</L>
<L>Here Douglas retires from his toils to relax,</L>
<L>The &s;courge of impo&s;tors, the terror of quacks:</L>
<L>Come all ye quack bards, and ye quacking divines,</L>
<L>Come and dance on the &s;pot where your tyrant reclines,</L>
<L>Where Satire and Cen&s;ure encircl'd his throne,</L>
<L>I fear'd for your &s;afety, I fear'd for my own;</L>
<L>But now he is gone, and we want a detector,</L>
<L>Our Dodds &s;hall be pious, our Kenricks &s;hall lecture;</L>
<L>Macpher&s;on write bomba&s;t, and call it a &s;tyle,</L>
<L>Our Town&s;hend make &s;peeches, and I &s;hall compile;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="12" MS="y">New La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ders and Bowers the Tweed &s;hall cro&s;s over,</L>
<L>No countryman living their tricks to di&s;cover;</L>
<L>Detection her taper &s;hall quench to a &s;park,</L>
<L>And Scotchman meet Scotchman and cheat in the dark.</L>
<L>Here lies David Garrick, de&s;cribe me who can,</L>
<L>An abridgment of all that was plea&s;ant in man;</L>
<L>As an actor, confe&s;t without rival to &s;hine,</L>
<L>As a wit, if not fir&s;t, in the very fir&s;t line,</L>
<L>Yet with talents like the&s;e, and an excellent heart,</L>
<L>The man had his failings, a dupe to his art;</L>
<L>Like an ill judge in beauty, his colours he &s;pread,</L>
<L>And beplai&s;ter'd, with rouge, his own natural red.</L>
<L>On the &s;tage he was natural, &s;imple, affecting,</L>
<L>'Twas only that, when he was off, he was acting:</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="13">With no rea&s;on on earth to go out of his way,</L>
<L>He turn'd and he varied full ten times a day;</L>
<L>Tho' &s;ecure of our hearts, yet confoundedly &s;ick,</L>
<L>If they were not his own by fine&s;&s;ing and trick,</L>
<L>He ca&s;t off his friends, as a hunt&s;man his pack;</L>
<L>For he knew when he plea&s;ed he could whi&s;tle them back.</L>
<L>Of prai&s;e, a mere glutton, he &s;wallowed what came,</L>
<L>And the puff of a dunce, he mi&s;took it for fame;</L>
<L>'Till his reli&s;h grown callous, almo&s;t to di&s;ea&s;e,</L>
<L>Who pepper'd the highe&s;t, was &s;ure&s;t to plea&s;e.</L>
<L>But let us be candid, and &s;peak out our mind,</L>
<L>If dunces applauded, he paid them in kind.</L>
<L>Ye Kenricks, ye Kellys, and Woodfalls &s;o grave,</L>
<L>What a commerce was yours, while you got and you gave?</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="14">How did Grub-&s;treet re-echo the &s;houts that you rais'd,</L>
<L>While he was bero&s;&s;ia'd, and you were beprais'd?</L>
<L>But peace to his &s;pirit, wherever it flies,</L>
<L>To act as an angel, and mix with the &s;kies:</L>
<L>Tho&s;e poets, who owe their be&s;t fame to his &s;kill,</L>
<L>Shall &s;till be his flatterers, go where he will.</L>
<L>Old Shake&s;peare, receive him, with prai&s;e and with love,</L>
<L>And Beaumonts and Bens be his Kellys above.</L>
<L>Here Hickey reclines a mo&s;t blunt, plea&s;ant creature,</L>
<L>And &s;lander it&s;elf mu&s;t allow him good-nature:</L>
<L>He cheri&s;h'd his friend, and he reli&s;h'd a bumper;</L>
<L>Yet one fault he had, and that one was a thumper:</L>
<L>Perhaps you may a&s;k if that man was a mi&s;er?</L>
<L>I an&s;wer, no, no, for he always was wi&s;er;</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="15" MS="y">Too courteous, perhaps, or obligingly flat;</L>
<L>His very wor&s;t foe can't accu&s;e him of that.</L>
<L>Perhaps he confided in men as they go,</L>
<L>And &s;o was too fooli&s;hly hone&s;t; ah, no.</L>
<L>Then what was failing? come tell it, and burn ye,</L>
<L>He was, could he help it? a &s;pecial attorney.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here Reynolds is laid, and to tell you my mind,</L>
<L>He has not left a better or wi&s;er behind;</L>
<L>His pencil was &s;triking, re&s;i&s;tle&s;s and grand,</L>
<L>His manners were gentle, complying and bland;</L>
<L>Still born to improve us in every part,</L>
<L>His pencil our faces, his manners our heart:</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="16">To coxcombs aver&s;e, yet mo&s;t civilly &s;taring,</L>
<L>When they judged without &s;kill he was &s;till hard of hearing:</L>
<L>When they talk'd of their Raphaels, Corregios and &s;tuff,</L>
<L>He &s;hifted his trumpet, and only took &s;nuff.</L>

<P><PB N="18" REF="18">"Here lies the good <HI>Dean,"</HI> page 7, line 5] Dr. Ber|nard, Dean of Derry, in Ireland, author of many ingenious pieces, particularly a reply to Macpher&s;on's Antiquities of Great Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P>"Here lies our <HI>good Edmund,"</HI> page 7, line 11] Mr. Edmund Burke.</P>
<P>"To per&s;uade <HI>Tommy Town&s;hend</HI> to lend him a vote," page 8, line 2] Mr. T. Town&s;hend Junior, Member for Whitchurch, Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>"Here lies hone&s;t <HI>William,</HI> page 8, line 11] Mr. Wil|liam Burke, late Secretary to General Conway, and Mem|ber for Bedwin, Wilt&s;hire.</P>
<P>"Here lies hone&s;t <HI>Richard,"</HI> page 9, line 5] Mr. Richard Burke, Collector of Granada, no le&s;s remarkable in the walks of wit and humour, than his brother Mr. Edmund Burke is ju&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed in all the branches of u&s;eful and polite literature.</P>
<P>"Now <HI>breaking a je&s;t,</HI> and now <HI>breaking a limb,"</HI> page 9, line 8] the above Gentleman having &s;lightly fractured one of his arms and legs, at different times, the Doctor has rallied him on tho&s;e accidents, as a kind of <HI>retributive</HI> ju&s;tice for breaking his je&s;ts upon other people.</P>
<P>"Here <HI>Cumberland</HI> lies," page 10, line 1] Doctor Richard Cumberland, author of the We&s;t Indian, Fa&s;hion|able Lover, the Brothers, and other dramatic pieces.</P>

<L>"The &s;courge of <HI>Impo&s;tors,</HI> the terror of <HI>Quacks,</HI>"</L>
<P>&mdash;page 11, lines 5 and 6] Doctor Douglas, an ingenious Scotch gentleman, who has no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a <HI>Citizen of the World,</HI> than a <HI>&s;ound Critic,</HI> in detecting &s;everal lite|rary mi&s;takes (or rather <HI>forgeries)</HI> of his countrymen; par|ticularly Lauder on Milton, and <HI>Bowyer's Hi&s;tory of the Popes.</HI></P>

<P>"Here lies <HI>David Garrick,"</HI> page 12, line 5] David Garrick, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> joint Patentee and acting Manager of the Theatre-Royal, Drury-lane. For the <HI>other parts</HI> of his character, <HI>vide</HI> the Poem.</P>
<P>"Here <HI>Hickey</HI> reclines," page 14, line 9] A gentleman who&s;e ho&s;pitality and good-humour have acquired him, in this Club, the title of 'hone&s;t Tom Hickey.' His profe&s;|&s;ion, the Doctor tells us, is that of an attorney, but whe|ther he meant the words an echo to the &s;en&s;e or not, he has told us &s;o in, perhaps, the only indifferent couplet of the whole Poem. To &s;often this cen&s;ure, however, in &s;ome re|&s;pect, the Engli&s;h Reader is to be told, that the phra&s;e of "burn ye," in the 5th line of the 15th page, tho' it may &s;eem <HI>forced</HI> to rhyme to "attorney," is a familiar method of &s;alutation in Ireland among&s;t the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people.</P>
