<P>THE PADLOCK: A COMIC OPERA: As it is perform'd by HIS MAJESTY'S SERVANTS, AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SHOULD any one be curious about the origin of this petty Drama, they will find the &s;tory on which it is founded, among the twelve Exemplary Novels written by the celebrated Author of Don Quixote; under the title of The Jealous Hu&s;band. Some little variation has been nece&s;&s;ary in the ground-work, in order to render it dramatic; but the characters are untouched from the inimitable pencil of the fir&s;t de|&s;igner; unle&s;s the dialogue with which the Engli&s;h writer &s;upplies them has done them an injury. The chief addition to the fable is the circum&s;tance of the padlock, and the four la&s;t lines of the opera &s;ufficiently mark the place from whence that is taken.</P>

<P>You know, Ur&s;ula, when I took Leonora from her father and mother, &s;he was to live in the hou&s;e with me three months; at the expiration of which time, I entered into a bond of four thou&s;and pi&s;toles, either to return her to them &s;potle&s;s, with half that &s;um for a dowry, or make her my true and lawful wife.</P>

<P>Ur&s;ula, I do believe it; and, you are parti|cularly happy, that both your age and your per&s;on ex|empt you from any &s;uch temptation. But, be this as it will, Leonora's parents, after &s;ome little difficulty, con&s;ented to comply with my propo&s;al; and, being fully &s;atisfied with their daughter's temper and conduct, which I wanted to be acquainted with, this day being the expiration of the term, I am re&s;olved to fulfil my bond by marrying her to-morrow.</P>
