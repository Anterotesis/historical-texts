<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE Secret HISTORY OF THE <HI>White STAFF,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_AS nothing is more irk&s;om to a Sen&s;ible Man, than to have his Judgment impos'd upon, &s;o nothing can be a greater Obligation to him than to be undeceiv'd. The Ca&s;e now before us is National; it is not a &s;ingle Per&s;on that is deceiv'd here; but the whole Body of the People are Banter'd and made Fools of: And what better Work can a Man &s;et his Hand to, for the Publick Service, than to
<PB N="4" REF="3">
detect the&s;e Frauds, and undeceive the World.</P>
<P>There have not been Two little Pam|phlets, publi&s;h'd for a long Time pa&s;t, which have made more Fooli&s;h Noi&s;e in the World, than the Fir&s;t and Second Part of the <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>White Staff</HI>; and it is the more wonderful, becau&s;e, as &s;hall &s;oon be made appear, there has been no Sub&s;tance, or Foundation in the Matters of Fact for them, or for any of the &s;everal Pamphlets which have follow'd them; but that the World has been very much amus'd and impos'd upon, both in the one and the other, and the whole has been a meer Delu&s;ion, an <HI>Ignis Fatuus,</HI> prepar'd either on Purpo&s;e to get a Penny by the Books, or to Deceive the People, or both: This being premis'd, it &s;eems Nece&s;&s;ary the World &s;hould know &s;omething of the HISTORY of the&s;e Two <HI>Secret Hi&s;to|ries</HI>; becau&s;e, by having this Matter &s;earch'd a little into, there will be brought to Light &s;ome Things very profitable to us in their being known, tho' mo&s;t ab&s;urd in them&s;elves; Things equally wonderful in the Effect, which they have had among the People, and equally &s;trange in the Kna|very of the Contrivers.</P>
<P>That we may arrive to a clear Notion of what is needful to be under&s;tood con|cerning tho&s;e Books, the Matter mu&s;t be
<PB N="5" REF="4">
fir&s;t laid down in General: <HI>Briefly,</HI> That the Book call'd the <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>White Staff</HI> &s;eems to be publi&s;h'd in Order to ju&s;tifie the Conduct, and clear up the Reputation of a late Great Mini&s;ter of State, known throughout the Book by the Title of the <HI>Staff,</HI> or as &s;ome of the An|&s;werers &s;ay, <HI>To rai&s;e a Du&s;t that he may be lo&s;t in the Cloud.</HI></P>
<P>In doing this, they run thro' many of the mo&s;t Con&s;iderable Tran&s;actions of State during the Mini&s;try of that Great Man, from his fir&s;t appearing in a Publick Employment or Office, in Her Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;hold, to the Death of the Queen; and as &s;ome pretend to &s;ay, artfully labours to make the <HI>Staff</HI> appear really a <HI>White Staff,</HI> wa&s;hing him clear from the Dirt ca&s;t up|on him by the Parties who have oppos'd him, and (who it may be likely) have as artfully endeavour'd to Blacken and De|face him, clearing up &s;undry Actions from the &s;uppos'd Guilt, with which they are charg'd, and laying the Blame on &s;uch as are really Blame-worthy upon other Heads.</P>
<P>How well they have perform'd is not the pre&s;ent Enquiry; it is ea&s;ie for Writers this Way, or that Way, to form a &s;pe|cious Tale to clear up the Characters which they would render Bright, or to blacken tho&s;e who they would Mi&s;repre|&s;ent: But what Weight is to be put upon
<PB N="6" REF="5">
&s;uch A&s;&s;urances we &s;hall &s;ee, when the <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory</HI> of the&s;e Books is a little far|ther laid down.</P>
<P>In the mean Time it is provoking to the la&s;t Degree, to &s;ee what Succe&s;s the&s;e Men have had in the Trick they have put upon the Town, and how univer&s;ally all &s;orts of Men have run into the Cheat, and been bubbled to accept the&s;e Romances for a true Narration, and have taken the Fable for a Hi&s;tory, without enquiring in|to the Things whether they were impos'd upon <HI>Yea,</HI> or <HI>No.</HI></P>
<P>The few Friends of the <HI>Staff</HI> on one Hand, (albeit they were not the fir&s;t who were deceiv'd, yet) were very &s;oon drawn into the Snare, taking the Book to be done by a Friend, or perhaps by him&s;elf, in order to Vindicate him to the World, by &s;etting his Actions in a true Light, and ca&s;ting the Blame of &s;undry Things, which common Fame laid at his Door, upon the Conduct of divers other Per&s;ons; perhaps the nearne&s;s of &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages which they found in the&s;e Books, to what they knew &s;omething of, in the Conduct of the <HI>Staff,</HI> or their willingne&s;s to have it be as it was there repre&s;ented; and their Pa&s;&s;ion to have others think as favourably of the <HI>Staff,</HI> as they did them&s;elves, might con|cur to Deceive them; fora&s;much as di|vers Things taken Notice of in tho&s;e Books
<PB N="7" REF="6">
might have &s;ome Connexion with other Pa&s;&s;ages which were really true, &s;o that it would be ea&s;ie for Men to be led a&s;ide at their fir&s;t View of Things. Al&s;o the Part the&s;e Men took with the <HI>Staff,</HI> in his Re|&s;entment of the Conduct of tho&s;e who had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd and &s;upplanted him at Court, bore no &s;mall Share in their Credulity, be|ing very willing that all imaginable Indig|nities &s;hould be offer'd to tho&s;e who had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in their Oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Staff,</HI> as to ca&s;t him out of his Seat, and to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of the Favour of his Prince, and to &s;ee them expos'd to all the World, who had expos'd him in &s;uch a Manner, which, as they &s;aid, was not to be forgiven.</P>
<P>The Enemies of the <HI>Staff, on the other Hand,</HI> &s;eem'd to be mov'd &s;o much at the Attempt made to clear up his Character, in Things which they &s;eem to have unan|&s;werably laid to his Charge, as that they could not let &s;lip &s;o fair an Opportunity, which &s;eem'd to them to offer it&s;elf in this Book, to load him with farther Infamy; and tho' at the fir&s;t View they found them|&s;elves capable to detect the <HI>Fal&s;ity</HI> and <HI>So|phi&s;try</HI> of the Books them&s;elves, as it is expre&s;s'd in &s;ome of their An&s;wers; yet they could not avoid the Snare of taking the Books for Genuine, and for a De&s;ign of
<PB N="8" REF="7">
the <HI>Staff,</HI> to &s;tart &s;omething into the World in his own Vindication.</P>
<P>The Writers of the Books &s;itting &s;till all this while, had their lei&s;ure to Laugh at Mankind, and to plea&s;e them&s;elves with thinking how either Side fell into their Snare, and bought up many Thou&s;ands of the Books, which as &s;hall pre&s;ently be &s;hewn, was the <HI>Summa Totalis</HI> of the De|&s;ign, and to &s;ee with what eagerne&s;s the Party Writers on every Side carried on the Paper War which they had rais'd; and which confirms the Truth of what is here a&s;&s;erted beyond all Contradiction. It &s;hall appear that the &s;ame People employing o|ther Hands, have been the Editors not only of the Books them&s;elves, but al&s;o of &s;everal of the An&s;wers to the&s;e Books, cau&s;ing the deceiv'd People to Dance in the Circles of their drawing, while the&s;e have enjoy'd the Sport of their own Witch|craft; and like the Hangers-on of the Camp, have taken the Spoil of the Field of Battle, as well of the Victors, as of the Vanqui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>It was but a few Days pa&s;t, when com|ing ca&s;ually into a Publick Coffee-Hou&s;e, and finding the whole Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>as for &s;ome Time it was,</HI> carried on by oppo&s;ite Parties upon the Subject of the&s;e Books, I joyn'd my &s;elf to the Company, where it was warmly enquir'd into who &s;hould be
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the Author, or Authors of the&s;e Books. I found One Man who appear'd as a Qua|ker, and &s;poke as a Quaker, altho' as I af|terwards under&s;tood, he was not a thorough Quaker, maintaining a Point, which differ'd from all, that had &s;poken about it; and which put me upon further enquiring into the Matter, than I had done before.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'<HI>Verily,</HI> &s;ays the Quaker, I <HI>think,</HI> that ye err much about this Matter, and I plainly perceive, that ye do not Judge rightly of the Per&s;ons, concerning whom ye are Di&s;cour&s;ing;'</Q> <HI>Why,</HI> &s;aid his Neigh|bour, who was his Oppo&s;er, Do'&s;t not thou think, that the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> has written this Book?</P>
<P><HI>Quaker.</HI> Nay, I do not believe it.</P>
<P><HI>Neigh.</HI> You Quakers are &s;o full of dou|ble Meanings, no Man can talk with you; do you not believe, that he has done it, or caus'd it to be done, that he has employ'd others to do it for him?</P>
<P><HI>Quak.</HI> If thou can&s;t not talk with me, then &s;hould'&s;t thou hold thy Peace. I am a Friend to the Truth, and a Lover of tho&s;e, that &s;peak uprightly, neither have I any double Meaning in my Speech.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
<HI>Neigh.</HI> An&s;wer me directly, Don't you believe, that he has done it, I &s;ay, or cau&s;ed it to be done for him?</P>
<P><HI>Quak.</HI> I do not.</P>
<P><HI>Neigh.</HI> Don't you believe that he has furni&s;h'd Materials for this Book to <HI>Daniel De Foe,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch other Scribler, as for Money he might get, to do &s;uch a Piece o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> Drudgery for him?</P>
<P><HI>Quak.</HI> I know not Lord <HI>Oxford,</HI> neither do I know <HI>Daniel De Foe</HI>; but this may &s;erve thee for an An&s;wer to thy Que&s;tion&punc; that I do not believe either Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> or any one for him had any Concern in Writing, or Compo&s;ing tho&s;e Books.</P>
<P><HI>Neigh.</HI> Pray let us hear your Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P><HI>Quak.</HI> Nay, now thou ask'&s;t of me a Que|&s;tion, which I am not under any Obliga|tion to comply with thee in.</P>
<P><HI>Neigh.</HI> That is true; but &s;aying you do not believe a Thing without telling any Rea&s;on for it, is the &s;tronge&s;t Argument
<PB N="11" REF="10">
you could bring to make us believe the contrary.</P>
<P><HI>Quak.</HI> I will give thee &s;ome of my Rea|&s;ons; but I will a&s;&s;ure thee al&s;o, they are not the chief Rea&s;ons, which I might give, which perchance, it may not be conveni|ent to mention at this Time.</P>
<P><HI>Neigh.</HI> Let us then have &s;uch Rea&s;ons, as you plea&s;e to give.</P>
<P><HI>Quak.</HI> One Rea&s;on is, That if it had been done by Lord <HI>Oxford,</HI> as thou &s;ay'&s;t it was, and that it was for his own Vindica|tion, he would not have Written that, which is &s;o unfit to perform what it is &s;up|pos'd to do, and that he would have vin|dicated him&s;elf in a better Manner, or not have meddled with it in Publick.</P>
<P><HI>Neigh.</HI> That is no Rea&s;on; his Cau&s;e is &s;o bad, it admits no Vindication.</P>
<P><HI>Quak.</HI> Nay, then my Rea&s;on is good, in that I &s;aid he would therefore have let it alone; but &s;eeing thou do&s;t not approve of my Rea&s;ons, I have no need to trouble thee with more of them. And here the Quaker &s;eem'd to make &s;ome Motion to ri&s;e and go away.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
<HI>Neigh.</HI> That is ju&s;t what I &s;aid before, that you have no, Rea&s;on at all.</P>
<P><HI>Quak.</HI> Thou thinke&s;t to move me by thy Words, to enter into Di&s;putations with thee of the&s;e Things; but I &s;hall not com|ply with thy De&s;ire; let it therefore &s;uf|fice thee, that I know what I have &s;aid to be Truth, the which is more than &s;aying, I believe it; and herewith the Quaker ro&s;e up and departed.</P>
<P>The Quaker's, la&s;t Words &s;tir'd up my Curio&s;ity, and I immediately follow'd him, and ask'd him if he would give me an Op|portunity to have a little Friendly Di&s;cour&s;e with him; that I had &s;een, how rudely they had treated him in the Coffee-Hou&s;e; but that I &s;hould let him &s;ee I had more Re&s;pect.</P>
<P>He yielded, and we went to a Publick Hou&s;e, where being &s;at down, I told him that had I read over the Books call'd <HI>The Se|cret Hi&s;tory of the Staff,</HI> &amp;c. And that I had frequent Thoughts about them, That I ob|&s;erv'd a great many Things, which in my Opinion look like Romances; that I often thought the whole was a continu'd Fiction; that &s;ome Things were put in, which if they
<PB N="13" REF="12">
were true, no Body could know, but tho&s;e who&s;e Intere&s;t it was not to make them Publick; That other Things were men|tion'd, which were not probable, &s;undry Speeches fram'd, which I believ'd were ne|ver &s;poken, and that I had long wi&s;h'd, that I might one Time or other come to &s;ome Di&s;covery of the Truth of the Ca&s;e, and that hearing him, tho' a Stranger to me, jump &s;o exactly with my Opinion, and that he &s;eem'd to have more Know|ledge of particular Circum&s;tances than I had, I was very earne&s;t to Di&s;cour&s;e with him about it; and that I might not hinder his being as free with me, as he would be with any Friend of his Acquaintance, I told him my Name, Place of Abode, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and nam'd &s;ome Eminent Quakers to him, whom I &s;uppos'd he might know, and who I knew, would an&s;wer for my Sincerity.</P>
<P>He heeded me very attentively, and when I had ended, he an&s;wer'd thus, or to this Purpo&s;e; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Friend, Thou &s;eem'&s;t to me to be a grave Per&s;on, and one who art &s;oberly &s;earching after the Know|ledge of the Truth, and I think it is meet that I &s;hould inform thee, of what I know concerning this Matter. For albeit I was not free to an&s;wer to a for|ward Man, whom I perceiv'd to &s;peak
<PB N="14" REF="13">
perver&s;ly to me without Cau&s;e; yet I &s;hall not refrain from thee in any Thing, wherein I may a&s;&s;i&s;t thy Under&s;tanding of the Truth.'<P>'I have been Curious in making enqui|ry concerning the Books, whereof thou &s;peake&s;t, and I may a&s;&s;ure thee, that they are no other than Fables, being compos'd by Evil Per&s;ons for Lucre and Gain; and that the Per&s;ons, whereof tho&s;e Men made mention, have had no Knowledge thereof, nor were concern'd in employ|ing, or directing the Writers thereof, and this thou may'&s;t be confirm'd in the Knowledge of, if thou wilt, as I have done, make diligent Enquiry among tho&s;e who are more e&s;pecially employ'd in Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Nature.'</P></Q></P>
<P>I was &s;urpriz'd with this Account, as I might well be, altho' it was nothing, but what I always believ'd; yet it made me &s;till more Curious to enquire of him, in what Manner he came to the Know|ledge of this Thing, &s;o as to be Satisfa|ctory; and that, while we believ'd the World was impos'd upon by the Books, we might not &s;uffer our &s;elves to be im|pos'd upon in our Enquiry after them: For, &s;aid I, in a Thing of this Nature, I
<PB N="15" REF="14">
would not take up with &s;light Evidence; he told me, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He had been very Particular in his Enquiry, and <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That he had obtain'd of a Friend to &s;peak of it to the Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> him&s;elf, and that the &s;aid Lord expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with the utmo&s;t Indignation at the Books them|&s;elves, a&s;&s;ur'd the Per&s;on who mention'd it to him, that he had no Knowledge of them till he &s;aw them in Print; that he always was of Opinion, that printed Vin|dications were u&s;ele&s;s Things, and inju|rious to the Per&s;ons, they would pretend to &s;erve; that he knew nothing he had done that needed any Vindication; but if it were otherwi&s;e, he de&s;ir'd he might be left to Vindicate him&s;elf, as he found Occa&s;ion; that many, if not mo&s;t of the Facts in the&s;e Books were Fal&s;e, and that tho&s;e, which had Truth in them, were mingled with &s;uch abundance of Ro|mance, as that they did not &s;o much as appear to be dre&s;s'd up like the Truth; that he di&s;lik'd every Thing in tho&s;e Books, and al&s;o the Manner, in which it was there plac'd; and that no one could oblige him more, than by letting the World know, that he di&s;own'd what was there reflecting upon others, and de&s;pis'd what pretended to be in behalf of him|&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">Be&s;ides this Account, which was very &s;atisfying, he told me that he had been Curious to get Information among the Writers of Pamphlets, to find out, if he could, either who had a Hand in it, or who they &s;uppos'd to have &s;o; that he had found one Friend, who was acquainted with that Per&s;on, who common Fame had tax'd with it in Publick, and that he had obtain'd from his &s;aid Friend to go to that Per&s;on. It &s;eems, he found the poor Man in a very Dangerous Condition, having had a Fit of an Apoplexy, and being ve|ry Weak, in&s;omuch, that his Life was de&s;pair'd of; but, mentioning the &s;aid Books to him, and that the Town charg'd him with being the Author of them, and that he had Written them by Direction of the &s;aid Lord <HI>Oxford,</HI> the &s;aid Per&s;on an&s;wer'd, That they did him a great deal of Wrong; neither did he believe, that the Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> was any Way concern'd, directly or indirectly in the &s;aid Books, and that he believ'd his Lord&s;hip had ne|ver heard of them till they were publi&s;h'd. It was true, he &s;aid, that he happen'd to &s;ee &s;ome of the Copy, while it was at the Pre&s;s, and that being de&s;ir'd to look upon it, he did Revi&s;e Two or Three Sheets of it, and mark'd &s;ome Things in them,
<PB N="17" REF="16">
which he di&s;lik'd; but for the re&s;t he could &s;afely Swear he never &s;aw them, or knew what was in them, till after they were printed, nor did he know whether the Things which he had mark'd (as a|bove &s;aid) were alter'd in the Print, <HI>Yea,</HI> or <HI>No.</HI></P>
<P>The Per&s;on who went to him, then ask'd him if he did not believe, that they were written at the De&s;ire, and by the Dire|ctions of People, who traded in &s;uch Books, and who did it meerly to get Money by them, without any other De&s;ign this Way or that Way re&s;pecting the Parties, or Di|vi&s;ions of the People: And he an&s;wer'd, <HI>He did verily believe it was &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>My Friend told me, he could not que&s;tion the Truth of what a Man, as it were &s;tep|ping into the Grave, had &s;o freely de|clar'd, and that he thought, Men could not an&s;wer charging Things Publickly upon others, without any Proof of them, &s;aving what was &s;ugge&s;ted to them, by the Sur|mi&s;es of their own Evil Thoughts, or of other Evil Per&s;ons, and he did not know how Men could an&s;wer wronging others in &s;uch a Manner.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">But that, which farther than all this con|firm'd this Quaker, <HI>as he &s;aid,</HI> in his be|leiving that it was not either of the Per|&s;ons above-mention'd who had written the&s;e Books, was a farther Information, which he told me he had met with from Two &s;everal Per&s;ons, <HI>who as he &s;aid,</HI> were of the Tribe of Writers, who are by the World call'd <HI>Hackneys,</HI> as before, who gave him &s;ome Account how the&s;e Books were manag'd, and by whom.</P>
<P>There are, it &s;eems, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> &s;everal Clubs, or Setts of the&s;e Men, who are kept in con&s;tant Employment by the Book|&s;ellers, or Publi&s;hers of Pamphlets, to Write on &s;uch and &s;uch Subjects, as the &s;aid Book&s;ellers &s;hall direct; and the&s;e &s;aid Book&s;ellers, or Publi&s;hers joyn together their Stocks, when &s;uch Books are written, to pay as well the Charge of Writing as of Printing the &s;ame, and then unite their Intere&s;t in their way of Trade, for the more effectual vending the &s;aid Books. And I am a&s;&s;ured, <HI>&s;aid he farther,</HI> That the&s;e Per&s;ons do not Con&s;ult the Side, or Party on which, or in who&s;e behalf the &s;aid Books may be &s;uppos'd to plead; but the great Thing, which they regard, is that the &s;aid Books <HI>may Sell</HI>; and if they
<PB N="19" REF="18">
find it &s;ells, &s;o as to an&s;wer their De&s;ign, they go on, perhaps, to employ the &s;ame Per&s;ons to write an An&s;wer, or An&s;wers thereto, and that he was &s;atisfy'd by his Friend, that the&s;e Books of the <HI>White Staff</HI> were written by &s;ome of the&s;e Men call'd <HI>Hackneys,</HI> as afore&s;aid, and by the Order of, and for the Wages given by &s;ome of the &s;aid Book&s;ellers, Publi&s;hers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that no other Per&s;ons, or De&s;igns were to be found concern'd therein.</P>
<P>I told him, this was a very Infamous Practice, if it was true; but de&s;ir'd to know if he had good Grounds to believe the &s;ame: He told me he thought he had &s;ufficient Ground to believe, that there were &s;uch People, and that there were &s;uch Setts of Men, who employ'd the&s;e Writers; and of this he had &s;uch Evidence, that, as he &s;aid, he was able to name &s;everal Men, who were &s;o em|ploy'd, and al&s;o tho&s;e, who did employ them; he likewi&s;e told me, he was a&s;|&s;ur'd of their doing this upon the &s;ingle View of gaining, by the vending or &s;ell|ing their Books without any other De&s;ign, not being concern'd what Cau&s;e, or what Principle the&s;e Men writ for or upon, &s;ee|ing, as he was inform'd, it was their fre|quent Practice to employ one Man, or Sett
<PB N="20" REF="19">
of Men to write a Book upon this or that Subject; and if that Book &s;ucceeded, that is to &s;ay, if it Sold well, then to employ others, or perhaps the &s;ame Hands to write An&s;wers to the &s;ame Book. And to confirm this, he told me he could a&s;|&s;ure me, that the Book entitled the <HI>Pur&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Mitre,</HI> which was written in Op|po&s;ition to the former Book the <HI>Staff,</HI> were written by the Order, and at the Expence of the very &s;ame Men, who had before caus'd the &s;aid <HI>Secret Hi&s;tory of the White Staff</HI> to be written; that the Writer, or Hackney, who was thus employ'd, was one <HI>Pittis,</HI> of whom more &s;hall be &s;poken afterwards.</P>
<P>And that albeit they were publi&s;h'd by a different Hand, the Principals were the very &s;ame, and they were Publi&s;h'd and Sold on the Account of the &s;ame Sett of Book&s;ellers; and this, he &s;aid, he was able to give &s;uffi|cient Te&s;timony to the Truth of, if there were any Occa&s;ion.</P>

wrong Premi&s;es: And this, <HI>my Friend, &s;aid he,</HI> is my Opinion of this Matter'.</Q></P>
<P>Reflecting after this upon the Quaker's Di&s;cour&s;e; for we went not much farther at that time, it produc'd &s;ome wonder in me, at the &s;trange U&s;age which Men give one another in this Age, and above all, it came very &s;trongly in my Mind; <HI>Good Lord!</HI> &s;aid I, What a Temper of Slander and Reproach is gone forth in the World! Were we to hear &s;ome Men talk of the Books call'd the <HI>White Staff,</HI> one cou'd hardly think but they knew for certain, and were able to prove it in a Court of Ju|&s;tice, that the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> was the Au|thor of them, or that they had &s;een him give the In&s;tructions for the writing them, to the Per&s;ons who he had employ'd. When the Books are read over, which are call'd the An&s;wers and Con&s;iderations upon the&s;e <HI>Hi&s;tories of the White Staff,</HI> where the Per|&s;ons are call'd the mo&s;t &s;candalous Names for writing them, which by this Quaker's Account have had no knowledge of them till they were publi&s;h'd; What Opinion mu&s;t we entertain of the Writers of the&s;e Books? And how will they take off all the Weight which might otherwi&s;e be thought due to the Arguments us'd in the&s;e Books? Where I &s;ee the Per&s;on who is &s;uppos'd
<PB N="28" REF="27">
to be the Original, treated with &s;uch Har&s;hne&s;s; the other who is charg'd with being his Tool, call'd &s;o many Ra&s;cals and &s;uch like Names, and yet in the bottom of the Ca&s;e, for ought I &s;ee, neither of the&s;e are in the lea&s;t concern'd in the original Part of the Books, What &s;hall be in Ju|&s;tice &s;aid to &s;uch a Practice? And what Principle mu&s;t the&s;e Authors have, who dare thus impo&s;e upon the World, in that whereof they know nothing, and dare thus charge Men po&s;itively and publickly, in that of which they have no Evidence, but their own partial Conjectures.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sheets have not the lea&s;t Affinity to a Vindication of the Earl of <HI>Oxford.</HI> The Undertaker hereof knows nothing of <HI>Da|niel de For,</HI> Mr. <HI>Pittis,</HI> or any other of the mercenary &s;cribling Tribe. The Que&s;tion now in debate with me, is, Whether it be true which the Quaker-above mention'd has laid down, yea or nay; and in enqui|ring after this, I have &s;incerely employ'd &s;ome Hours: Let the <HI>White Staff</HI> be as black as the Devil, let his Actions merit all the Reproach that good Men think their Due, or that bad Men can ca&s;t upon them: in fine, let him be all that can be either ju&s;tly or unju&s;tly &s;aid of him; yet it is certain nothing ought to be &s;aid either of
<PB N="29" REF="28">
him, or of any other Per&s;on which is <HI>not true,</HI> nay, nor which cannot be prov'd to be true.</P>
<P>But neither is this the true De&s;ign of this Book, for howbeit Men will take the Liberty to &s;ay of tho&s;e again&s;t whom they write Things not true, or perhaps Things which they have not &s;ufficient Evidence of; yet who &s;hall go about in &s;uch a Day as this is, to reprehend the Vice of our an|gry Party-Men, &s;hall be &s;ure to get no|thing but &s;ome of the Dirt, which they were before throwing at one another, to be thrown at him by both Sides, and be like the Guides who brought the <HI>Dutch</HI> Troops into <HI>Reading,</HI> at the Time of the Revolu|tion, who running too bu&s;ie about to &s;how the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> their Enemy, and to mark out the Villains who were to cut their Throats, were &s;hot in the Fray by their own Friends, for not &s;tanding out of the Way.</P>
<P>But the U&s;e that I would make of this is, to admoni&s;h tho&s;e who write, that how|ever they treat tho&s;e Men they write a|gain&s;t, they would have &s;ome regard for tho&s;e whom they write <HI>unto,</HI> that is to &s;ay, That albeit they may not regard loading tho&s;e they write again&s;t with Accu&s;ations,
<PB N="30" REF="29">
and blackning them with Crimes, whether they may be guilty or no; yet that they would take care of their Friends <HI>to whom</HI> they write, that they do not impo&s;e upon them to believe Lies, and Things which have no Foundation, but in the crazy prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd Imaginations of a Party, putting Su&s;picions and Conjectures upon them for Matters of Fact, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their Minds to be|lieve a Lie.</P>
<P>I could not but reflect with particular A&s;toni&s;hment upon the Book call'd the <HI>Mitre</HI> and the <HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> how I found a Raging, &s;omething like a Frenzy in the very Fron|ti&s;piece, the Man &s;eeming to be in a poe|tick Fury at the Per&s;on call'd the <HI>White Staff</HI>; he talks in his Title of the <HI>Hypocri&s;y and Villany</HI> of the <HI>White Staff</HI>; he draws a Bill upon <HI>Virgil</HI> for that eminent Line, which as he takes it, will be very accepta|ble to all the Enemies of the <HI>White Staff,</HI> viz. <Q>Quo teneam vultus mutantem protea nodo.</Q></P>
<P>Having al&s;o &s;ome Credit with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Poets, he draws another Bill upon <HI>Dry|den,</HI> in his <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> and <HI>Achitophel,</HI> which he &s;hoots like an envenom'd Arrow direct|ly at the <HI>White Staff.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="31" REF="30">He left not Faction, but of that was left.</Q>
<P>When he enters upon his Subject, he remembers what would gratifie the Town, and falls upon the common Topick, thus, <HI>The Mercenary that has been hir'd to rai&s;e a Du&s;t, in order to blind People's Eyes from &s;eeing clearly into the White Staff's true Character, having,</HI> &amp;c.

<P><PB N="37" REF="36">But to put this Matter out of all Que&s;tion, and to put to Silence the Writers, who have taken upon them to publi&s;h to the World, that this, that, and the other Per&s;on have written, or caus'd to be written the&s;e &s;aid Books, En|tituled, <HI>The Secret Hi&s;tory of the Staff; The Se|cret Hi&s;tory of the Mitre and Pur&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. The Writer of the&s;e Sheets makes this brief, but po&s;itive Propo&s;al to them, which if they do not accept, they mu&s;t be Self-condemn'd, and all Men mu&s;t take their Silence for a Confe&s;&s;ion of their Guilt; the Propo&s;al is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI> Let any of the Writers who have fix'd the Writing, or cau&s;ing the&s;e &s;aid Books to be written, upon the Per&s;on or Direction of the &s;aid <HI>White Staff, Mitre</HI> and <HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> bring any Evidence to prove, that it was &s;o in Fact; and that the &s;aid Per&s;ons, known to be meant by the &s;aid Names of the <HI>Staff, Mitre</HI> or <HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> did write, or direct to be written, or know of, or con&s;ent to the Writing of the &s;aid Books, or any Part or Parcel thereof; or that even the &s;aid <HI>Staff, Pur&s;e</HI> or <HI>Mitre,</HI> or any of them did ever &s;ee the &s;aid Books, or hear of them, or any Part of them, before they were printed and publi&s;h'd; I &s;ay, let them bring any Evi|dence other than bare Report, or their own Conjectures; and then the Writer of the&s;e Sheets will be confronted with and again&s;t them, and will ingage him&s;elf to prove, who were the Writers of the &s;aid Books, or at lea&s;t, who were the De&s;igners of, and Employ|ers of tho&s;e, who did write them; and will prove by irrefragable Te&s;timony, that it was impo&s;&s;ible any of the &s;aid Per&s;ons, &s;o repre|&s;ented by the Names of the <HI>Staff,</HI> the <HI>Mitre</HI> and
<PB N="38" REF="37">
<HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> could be concern'd in writing the &s;ame, or have any Knowledge directly or indirectly thereof.</P>
<P>The&s;e Propo&s;als are &s;o equitable, and mu&s;t be acknowledg'd &s;o by every ju&s;t Per&s;on, that we might even Appeal to the Authors them|&s;elves, to be the Cen&s;urers of their own Wri|tings; and if any of them are incumber'd with tho&s;e Things call'd Reflections (as it is fear'd much that they are not) they mu&s;t be brought acknowlege, that they have been too credulous, too forward to charge Men with Crimes, which they could not prove them to be Guilty of; and that they have been too willing to impo&s;e upon the Credulity of the Age, in&s;inuating to them, that &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons have been concern'd in &s;uch and &s;uch Things, when they them&s;elves cannot give any Evidence, that it is &s;o in Truth, or Rea&s;on, why the other &s;hould believe &s;o.</P>
<P>What Satisfaction the&s;e Men would make, for &s;landering other Per&s;ons in &s;uch a Manner; That indeed is a Thing, which, it is to be doubted, &s;uch Men lay little to Heart; the Men who can &s;atisfy them&s;elves to &s;lander their Enemies, and impo&s;e upon their Friends, can ill be &s;uppos'd to concern them&s;elves in making Reparation for the Injury done to the Per&s;ons &s;lander'd, as was remark'd at the Be|ginning. I am not concern'd to defend them, let them An&s;wer for them&s;elves; howbeit, for the innocent common People, who are made <HI>to believe</HI> a Lie by tho&s;e Men, for their Sakes, I &s;ay, it is but ju&s;t, that &s;uch Practices as the&s;e &s;hould be expos'd, as they de&s;erve; that they may be better inform'd, and may be made to
<PB N="39" REF="38">
&s;ee who they are, that delude and deceive them. The&s;e Men, when they read the &s;everal An&s;wers to the Books call'd the <HI>White Staff,</HI> the <HI>Mitre</HI> and <HI>Pur&s;e,</HI> and therein find &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons of Quality charg'd directly with wri|ting, or hiring others to write <HI>thus</HI> and <HI>thus,</HI> have nothing to do but to Enquire, Fir&s;t, <HI>How do we know that the&s;e Men did write the&s;e Things.</HI> Secondly, <HI>How doth it appear? where doth the An&s;werer, or Con&s;iderer prove the Charge?</HI> And if they find that this Charge is not prov'd, or the Proof not attempted in their Writings, why then all the re&s;t is nothing but the mo&s;t impudent begging the Que&s;tion, that has ever been known.</P>
<P>The Writer of the&s;e Sheets is too well ac|quainted with the Spirit of the Men, who will be offended at this Thing; and that they will defend the Crime of which they are Guilty, by joining thereunto another Crime; that is to &s;ay, they will defend one fal&s;e Thing with &s;ay|ing another. They have &s;aid already, that the&s;e Books were written by &s;uch and &s;uch Per|&s;ons, and being able to bring no other, or fur|ther Te&s;timony thereof, they will add &s;till, that they affirm it, that it is and mu&s;t be &s;o: But this is Popery in the mo&s;t Je&s;uitical Branch of it, covering a Fraud with a greater Fraud; Prote&s;tants are come to a Point in &s;uch Things, <HI>viz.</HI> to believe nothing without &s;ome Proof. If it &s;hall be alledg'd, that direct Proof cannot be obtain'd in &s;uch Ca&s;es; it is reply'd to this, that where po&s;itive Proof cannot be obtain'd, no Fact &s;hou'd be po&s;itively charg'd: What cannot be prov'd, &s;hould not be affirm'd; For, <HI>Affirmanti incumbat probatio.</HI> They &s;hould with
<PB N="40" REF="39">
Mode&s;ty and Caution have Argu'd, if the&s;e Things are written by &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons, or by &s;uch and &s;uch mercenary Hirelings by their Direction, then &s;o and &s;o, <HI>prout</HI> in their An&s;wers: But not a Man of the&s;e An&s;werers and Con&s;iderers, that I have met with, have given them&s;elves the Trouble to u&s;e any Mea|&s;ures for a Salvo to their own Reputations; but have &s;hot their Bolts, like the Fool; affirm'd without Probation; Charg'd the Guilt with|out &s;earching for the Evidence; and when the World cometh to be convinc'd of this Part, of what Force can all they have &s;aid after it be, with any con&s;idering Per&s;on?</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave it upon this I&s;&s;ue; Nothing can be more convincing to the Under&s;tanding of any Man, than this; The&s;e Books have been written and publi&s;h'd by Men, unconcern'd in the Fact, who in the Way of their Trade, as Book&s;ellers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have put Romances upon the World; a Sett of Writers, <HI>as bad as they,</HI> have taken hold of the Subject repre&s;ented therein; and pretending to An&s;wer the Books, have be|gun with a Fal&s;hood, without taking the lea&s;t Pains to clear it up: As they went on, have charg'd the Writing upon Per&s;ons no way con|cern'd therein, without taking one Step to prove, that what they had &s;o charg'd was true. This Stumble being made at the Thre&s;hold, all that they have &s;aid therein, is mo&s;t egre|giou&s;ly wicked; and either fal&s;e in Fact, or in Con&s;equence: The Per&s;ons are injur'd, and their Country abus'd and impos'd upon, in a criminal and abominable Manner.</P>
