<HEAD>THE CHARACTER OF A Fine GENTLEMAN.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is nothing reflects a darker Shade on all the Glories Earth can boa&s;t of, than the &s;erious Con&s;idera|tion of their tran&s;itory Nature? How do their riche&s;t Beauties fade as the Colours of a Rainbow? And vani&s;h like the gaudy Ima|ges of a deluding Vi&s;ion? The &s;weete&s;t Plea|&s;ures which charm Mankind, that warble &s;o agreeably on the Sen&s;es, and &s;urprizingly cap|tivate the Imagination, glide away in a Moment, and are often &s;ucceeded by the mo&s;t melancholy Sentiments. Such an ea&s;y Tran&s;ition is there from the Mirth of a Fe&s;tival, to the Gloom of a Funeral; that we cannot but admire the Wi&s;|dom
<PB N="2" REF="11">
of tho&s;e Antients, who mingled the Em|blems of Mortality with the brighte&s;t and gay|e&s;t Scenes of Nature, and thought the glowing Crim&s;on of a Ro&s;e, and the Virgin Whitene&s;s of the Lilly, le&s;s ornamental to their Gardens, than the awful Monuments and venerable Urns of their departed Ance&s;tors. All Conditions of Life are open to the Strokes of Fortune, who&s;e violent and unrelenting Storms will rend alike the Hermitage, the Cottage, and the Palace. Tho' the greater part of Mankind delight in Mirth, and flee from Sorrow as from the Hor|rors of a Midnight Apparition; yet it fre|quently overtakes them, and often pierces the very Soul of the dulle&s;t Pea&s;ant, of the mo&s;t airy Wit, of the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Politician. Di&s;honour and Grief have many times &s;oiled the Royal Purple, and &s;tained the triumphant Lu&s;tre of Imperial En&s;igns. What Favourite of Nature, what Darling of Fortune can then promi&s;e him&s;elf, with Security, a long Conti|nuance of Felicity? Had young <HI>Philindus</HI> well attended to &s;uch Thoughts as the&s;e, had not his ungoverned Fancy rai&s;ed imaginary Scenes, and dre&s;t them in fairy Beauties; his Di&s;appoint|ment would not have been &s;o great, nor the Tide of his Sorrows &s;o con&s;iderable and impe|tuous. Indeed when fir&s;t he began to conver&s;e with the World, and make a publick Appea|rance, 'twas with &s;o much advantage, that per|haps a more &s;olid Genius than his would have
<PB N="3" REF="12">
promi&s;ed him&s;elf not a little Happine&s;s from &s;uch an agreeable Pro&s;pect: The Comeline&s;s of his Per&s;on, the Sweetne&s;s of his Temper, the Bright|ne&s;s of his Parts, and the Lu&s;tre of his Fortune, con&s;pire to di&s;tingui&s;h him, as a Per&s;on born for &s;ome noble End, in who&s;e future Behavi|our one might hope di&s;tinctly to trace the Chri|&s;tian, the Patriot, and the Gentleman; yet, alas! this blooming Youth, enchanted with the Mu&s;ick of the <HI>Syrens,</HI> and &s;educed by Flattery and Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, lo&s;t his Innocence, his Friends, and his Fortune: After which, he would often take a &s;olitary Walk round the neighbouring Fields, and there lament, like <HI>Eve</HI> when &s;he left her Nuptial Bower, and &s;urveyed, with &s;treaming Eyes, the depart|ing Beauties of <HI>Eden.</HI> One Morning in par|ticular he ro&s;e very early, and being full of Me|ditations, and inten&s;ely pur&s;uing a long Train of Thought, he wandered much farther than u&s;ual; whil&s;t the Verdure of the Fields, and the Mu|&s;ick of the Woods, entertained his Sen&s;es in the mo&s;t agreeable manner. Thus roved the unfortunate <HI>Philindus,</HI> till the Heat of the Sun obliged him to &s;top at a little Grove; in the mo&s;t retired part of which he found a pretty Arbour, and there he &s;at down to re&s;t him. At that in&s;tant he was oppre&s;&s;ed with a Torrent of Grief; and the unhappy Youth cry'd out in the greate&s;t Agony of Spirit: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A&s;&s;i&s;t me, mo&s;t merciful Redeemer, and &s;end &s;ome ten|der
<PB N="4" REF="13">
Guardian-Angel to &s;upport my fainting Spi|rits and help an Imagination, which bleeds a fre&s;h at every momentary Reflection. Oh! the fatal Errors of my pa&s;t Life! Were I Ma|&s;ter of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Magnificence, or Lord of the Stars, I would, with Tran&s;port, re&s;ign all for the happy Opportunity of correcting them; but the Months that are gone, are fled for ever."</Q></P>
<P>He had proceeded in his Soliloquy, had not he been hindered by the Approach of a young Clergyman, who was coming to that Arbour, which he almo&s;t daily vi&s;ited. It is a com|mon Ob&s;ervation, that when Per&s;ons of Learn|ing and Politene&s;s meet together, though Stran|gers to each other, they &s;oon fall into an ea&s;y, graceful, and familiar Air; and conver&s;e, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, like intimate Acquaintance. This was the Ca&s;e before us: The Clergyman, after &s;ome little time, began, in an obliging manner, to enquire what Adventure had brought him thi|ther; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I do not remember to have &s;een any here before, except tho&s;e who came from our Family: and no wonder, &s;ince there is no common Path lies any way near it."</Q> <HI>Philindus</HI> told him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was his Cu|&s;tom to walk round the Fields, and there &s;ooth a melancholy Softne&s;s incident to him; that he had wander'd far beyond his u&s;ual Li|mits, and at la&s;t, by Accident, found out that Place of Ea&s;e and Refre&s;hment."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="14">"The Chaplain (for &s;uch it &s;eems he was) gave him to under&s;tand, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he lived about a Mile off, in the Hou&s;e of a great Gentleman: <HI>And then added with a Sigh,</HI> Our Family has this Morning met with the &s;harpe&s;t Afflicti|on imaginable, in the Death of that ine&s;ti|mable Per&s;on. O dear <HI>Serino</HI>! how di&s;mal is the Sound of thy Death to every di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed Neighbour? Whil&s;t each Per&s;on laments, as though he had lo&s;t the Darling of his Hopes and Family, and the Women were pre|paring their Fir&s;t-born for the Funeral: Even this delightful Retirement has now lo&s;t its Beauty, and I find 'twas his endearing Con|ver&s;ation, and reviving Pre&s;ence, that gave the Grove its riche&s;t Charms. How many thou&s;and Eyes will then overflow with Tears, when he &s;hall be carried to his Grave, who&s;e Bounty and Compa&s;&s;ion have re&s;cued many from it? However, he will be laid to Re&s;t with Honour, and his un&s;tained A&s;hes &s;hri|ned in immortal Urns, who&s;e Gold no Ru&s;t can canker; not Malice, nor Envy it-&s;elf, did once attempt to defame him living, much le&s;s will they offer to violate his peaceful Marble."</Q></P>
<P>Here he pau&s;ed, and <HI>Philindus</HI> de&s;ired he would be plea&s;ed to favour him with &s;ome Ac|count of that Gentleman, who&s;e Virtues were &s;o con&s;picuous: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Indeed, <HI>continu'd he,</HI> I have heard of many noble Actions of the brave
<PB N="6" REF="15">
<HI>Serino</HI>; but &s;ince you had the Honour and Happine&s;s to be intimate with him, I may rea&s;onably expect &s;omething more entertain|ing and particular. And &s;ince we are thus by Accident met together, I &s;hould be very glad to &s;pend &s;ome time in free and &s;erious Conver&s;e; which may perhaps prove of more advantage to us, than if we had indulged our&s;elves in melancholy and &s;olitary Medita|tions; which, I perceive, is what we both propo&s;ed at our walking out: And, for my part, I cannot but think, the many tedious Steps I have this Morning taken, &s;ufficiently recompen&s;ed, by my meeting, in this Place, a Gentleman who&s;e A&s;pect and obliging Ad|dre&s;s promi&s;e &s;o much agreeable Entertain|ment."</Q> The Chaplain reply'd, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That no|thing could be more grateful to him than &s;uch a Propo&s;al:"</Q> And then immediately be|gan, after this manner, to give an Account of <HI>Serino.</HI></P>
<P>AS Religion is certainly the chief Con|cern and greate&s;t Ornament of Man|kind, which adds fre&s;h Lu&s;tre to the Jewels of a Crown, and adorns with a new Grace the noble&s;t Scepters, 'twas always <HI>Serino</HI>'s Opinion, That the &s;incere Practice of it did much more re|commend a Gentleman to the E&s;teem of his Con|temporaries, than the mo&s;t &s;tately Buildings, the mo&s;t delicious Gardens, or the mo&s;t &s;hining E|quipage:
<PB N="7" REF="16">
As well knowing and con&s;idering, that all this Pomp and Beauty would &s;oon be lo&s;t in Silence and Ob&s;curity; whil&s;t Vertue re&s;erves, for her Votaries, Rewards which are unknown and eternal. Indeed of late Years, &s;ome, who would be thought Men of uncommon Parts, and &s;et up for Wits of the fir&s;t Rank, are of a quite different Opinion; and whil&s;t they are indu&s;triou&s;ly propagating their Athei&s;ti|cal Notions, make no Scruple of bantering the mo&s;t aweful My&s;teries of Religion: But He always thought there was &s;o much Ab&s;urdity and Contradiction in their impious Schemes, as was &s;ufficient to hinder any wi&s;e Man from em|bracing them. I believe I &s;hall never forget tho&s;e Conferences which I have had with him on this weighty Subject, the Sub&s;tance of which I &s;hall be very ready to impart to You; provi|ded you will be &s;o free as &s;ometimes to relieve me, by intermingling &s;uch Ob&s;ervations, as &s;hall appear mo&s;t natural and proper.</P>

<P>His Rea&s;onings upon this Head were after this manner: That there is a Supreme Being, of infinite Perfection and Glory, is a Notion which the Mind of every Man is apt to a&s;&s;ent to, as &s;oon as 'tis propo&s;ed: And &s;ome
<PB N="8" REF="17">
Great Men, <HI>Cicero</HI> in particular, carry the Mat|ter much farther, and repre&s;ent this Notion of a God as an innate Idea, which is Born with us, and interwoven with our Con&s;titution.

<P>Pray, Sir, before you proceed, give me leave to mention one grand Objection which is brought in behalf of Infidelity, and that is this; That we can have no Idea of God, and therefore can have no Evidence of his Exi&s;tence. And &s;ome athei&s;tical Per&s;ons argue after this manner: The Notion of a Deity, which is commonly entertain'd, is nothing but a Bundle of Incomprehen&s;ibles, Inconceivables, and Im|po&s;&s;ibles; it being only a Compilement of all imaginable Attributes of Honour, Court&s;hip, and Compliment, which the confounded Fear
<PB N="14" REF="23">
and A&s;toni&s;hment of Men's Minds make them huddle up together, without any Sen&s;e or Phi|lo&s;ophical Truth. This &s;eems to be intimated by a modern Writer, in the&s;e Words: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Attributes of God &s;ignify not true, nor fal&s;e, nor any Opinion of our Brain, but the Reverence and Devotion of our Hearts; and therefore they are not &s;ufficient Premi&s;es to infer Truth, or convince Fal&s;hood."</Q> And the &s;ame Thing again is farther &s;et out, with no &s;mall Pretence to Wit, after this manner; They that venture to di&s;pute philo&s;ophically, or rea&s;on of God's Nature, from the&s;e Attri|butes of Honour, lo&s;ing their Under&s;tanding in the very fir&s;t Attempt, fall from one Incon|venience into another, without End, and with|out Number; in the &s;ame manner as when one, ignorant of the Ceremonies of the Court, com|ing into the Pre&s;ence of a greater Per&s;on than he is u&s;ed to &s;peak to, and &s;tumbling at his En|trance, to &s;ave him&s;elf from falling, lets &s;lip his Cloak; to recover his Cloak, lets fall his Hat; and with one Di&s;order after another, di&s;covers his A&s;toni&s;hment and Ru&s;ticity.</P>

<SPEAKER>Chapl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To affirm that there is no Idea of God, is all one as to affirm, that there is no Conception of the Mind an&s;wering to that Word or Name: And indeed the modern A|thei&s;ts &s;tick not to maintain, That the Word GOD has no Signification, and that there is no other Idea or Conception in Men's Minds
<PB N="15" REF="24">
an&s;wering thereunto, be&s;ides the mere Phanta&s;m of the Sound. And &s;ince, as the learned Dr. <HI>Cudworth</HI> ob&s;erves, there are different Words for GOD in &s;everal Languages, and Men have the &s;ame Notion or Conception in their Minds an|&s;wering to them all; it mu&s;t needs be granted, that they have &s;ome other Idea or Conception belonging to tho&s;e Words, be&s;ides the Phan|ta&s;ms of their &s;everal Sounds. And indeed it can be nothing el&s;e, but either mon&s;trous Sot|ti&s;hne&s;s and Stupidity of Mind, or el&s;e prodi|gious Impudence in the&s;e Athei&s;ts, to deny that there is any Idea of God at all in the Minds of Men, or that the Word hath any Signification. But whatever the&s;e Athei&s;ts deny in Words, it is notwith&s;tanding evident, that even them&s;elves have an Idea or Conception in their Minds, an|&s;wering to the Word GOD, when they deny his Exi&s;tence; becau&s;e otherwi&s;e they would deny the Exi&s;tence of nothing. And then as to his being ab&s;olutely perfect, and of infinite Power, the Pagan-Thei&s;ts did acknowledge it, as might be proved from va&s;t Numbers of Pa&s;|&s;ages in their Writings. Thus <HI>Virgil</HI>;

<PB N="16" REF="25">
of the Univer&s;e; and yet &s;o very unrea|&s;onable are the Athei&s;ts, that they will not al|low even of this, but find fault with the Crea|tion, and pretend to &s;py out many con&s;iderable Defects in the Frame of Nature, and Con&s;ti|tution of the Heavens: For in&s;tance, the Di&s;|po&s;ition of the Equator and Ecliptick inter&s;ec|ting each other in an Angle of twenty-three Degrees and upwards, whereby (as they &s;ay) the terre&s;trial Globe is rendered much more un|inhabitable than otherwi&s;e it might be. Again, they remark, that Part of the Earth lies deformed and inho&s;pitable, either by burning Heat, or freezing Cold; they likewi&s;e take notice of the Variety of tho&s;e &s;avage Bea&s;ts which terrify Mankind; and thence, with <HI>Lucretius,</HI> con|clude, that the&s;e Things are not under the Con|duct of a wi&s;e and merciful Being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chapl.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to their Notion of the Equator, it is built upon a fal&s;e Suppo&s;ition of the Antients, That the Torrid Zone, or all between the Tro|picks, was utterly uninhabitable, by rea&s;on of the Extremity of the Heat; and it is certain that there is nothing which doth more demon|&s;trate a Providence, than this very thing, it be|ing the mo&s;t convenient Site or Di&s;po&s;ition that could be devi&s;ed, as will appear if the Inconve|niences of other Di&s;po&s;itions be con&s;idered, e|&s;pecially the&s;e three: (1.) If the Axis of the&s;e Circles &s;hould be parallel, and their Plaries co|incident. (2.) If they &s;hould inter&s;ect each
<PB N="17" REF="26">
other in right Angles. And (3.) which is a Middle betwixt both, if they &s;hould cut one another in an Angle of forty-five Degrees; for it is evident, that each of the&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions would be attended with far greater Inconveni|ences to the terre&s;trial Inhabitants, in re&s;pect of the Length of Days and Nights, Heat and Cold: And that the&s;e two Circles &s;hould con|tinue thus to keep the &s;ame angular Inter&s;ection, when phy&s;ical and mechanical Cau&s;es would bring them &s;till nearer together; this is a far|ther Evidence of a Providence al&s;o. And then as to the &s;avage Animals, as we are a&s;&s;ured by Revelation, that they were not originally noxi|ous to Mankind, but became &s;o by Sin, &s;o even now they are of &s;ome U&s;e and Service to them.</P>

<P>That there is a God, is proved by the general Con&s;ent of Mankind concerning it; by that <Q REND="inline"><HI>Te&s;timonium,</HI> as <HI>Lactantius</HI> &s;peaks, <HI>Populorum atque Gentium in una hac re non di&s;&s;identium,</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That unanimous Te&s;timony of all People and Nations, not di&s;agreeing in this only Point."</Q></Q> If the Authority of &s;ome particular Men, agree|ing in Vote, of one City, of one Nation, doth pa&s;s for an Argument, and &s;hews the Thing probable; how can we decline or contemn the common Suffrage of Mankind? Another Ar|gument of God's Exi&s;tence, which gave great
<PB N="18" REF="27">
Satisfaction to <HI>Serino,</HI> is drawn from the Di&s;co|veries of a Divine Power, in Works that can|not be a&s;cribed to any other Cau&s;e vi&s;ible or natural; &s;uch are the Prediction of future E|vents, (e&s;pecially &s;uch as are contingent, and depend upon Man's free Choice) curing the Sick of great chronical Di&s;tempers, without any medicinal Applications; re&s;toring Limbs to Per&s;ons maimed; Sight to the Blind; and rai|&s;ing the Dead to Life, (a thing which <HI>Pliny</HI> deemed impo&s;&s;ible to God him&s;elf.) To this Head belong tho&s;e Opinions and Te&s;timonies of Mankind concerning Apparitions, Inchant|ments, and Con&s;ederacy with bad Spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Phil.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the general Opinion of Mankind, the Athei&s;t would make us believe, that this Ap|prehen&s;ion of a God doth &s;pring from an infi|nite Jealou&s;y in the Mind of Man, and an end|le&s;s Fear of the wor&s;t that may happen; accor|ding to that divine Saying of the Poet, which he can never &s;ufficiently admire:
<Q>Primus in orbe DEOS fecit TIMOR. <Q>FEAR fir&s;t made GODS.</Q></Q>
So that it is granted on both Sides, that the Fear of a Deity doth univer&s;ally po&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds of Men. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Now the Que&s;tion is, (&s;ays the learned Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on</HI>) whether it be more like|ly that the Exi&s;tence of a God &s;hould be the
<PB N="19" REF="28">
Cau&s;e of this Fear, or that this Fear &s;hould be the Cau&s;e why Men imagine there is a God? If there be a God, who hath impre&s;|&s;ed this Image of him&s;elf upon the Mind of Man, there is great rea&s;on why all Men &s;hould &s;tand in awe of him; but if there be no God, it is not ea&s;y to conceive how Fear &s;hould create an univer&s;al Confidence and A&s;&s;urance in Men that there is one. For whence &s;hould this Fear come? It mu&s;t be either from without, from the Sugge&s;tion of others, who fir&s;t tell us there is &s;uch a Being, and then our Fear believes it; or el&s;e it mu&s;t ari&s;e from within, from the Nature of Man, which is apt to fancy dreadful and terrible Things. If from the Sugge&s;tions of others, who tell us &s;o, the Que&s;tion returns, Who told them &s;o? And will never be &s;atis|fied till the fir&s;t Author of this Report be found out. But if it be &s;aid, that this Fear ari&s;eth from within, from the Nature of Man, which is apt to imagine dreadful Things; this likewi&s;e is liable to inexplicable Difficul|ties: For, fir&s;t, the proper Object of Fear, is &s;omething that is dreadful; that is, &s;ome|thing that threatens Men with Harm or Danger, and that in God mu&s;t be either Power or Ju&s;tice; and &s;uch an Object as this, Fear indeed may create, but Goodne&s;s and Mercy are e&s;&s;ential to the Notion of a God, as well as Power and Ju&s;tice. Now
<PB N="20" REF="29">
how &s;hould Fear put Men upon fancying a Being, that is infinitely good and merciful?"</Q> Indeed, as that great Prelate, ju&s;t now menti|oned, ob&s;erves, if a Man had Arguments &s;uffi|cient to per&s;uade him, that there is no God, (as there is infinite Rea&s;on to the contrary) yet the Belief of a God is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the Com|fort and Happine&s;s of our Lives, that a wi&s;e Man could not but be heartily troubled to quit &s;o plea&s;ant an Error, and to part with a Delu|&s;ion which is apt to yield &s;uch an un&s;peakable Satisfaction to the Mind of Man. Did Men but con&s;ider the true Notion of God, he would appear to be &s;o lovely a Being, and &s;o full of Goodne&s;s, and all de&s;irable Perfections, that even tho&s;e very Per&s;ons, who are of &s;uch irre|gular Under&s;tandings, as not to believe there is a God; yet could not (if they under&s;tood them&s;elves) refrain from wi&s;hing with all their Hearts, that there were one: For is it not really de&s;irable to every Man, that there &s;hould be &s;uch a Being in the World, as takes care of the Frame of it, that it do not run into Confu&s;ion, and in that Di&s;order ruin Mankind? That there &s;hould be &s;uch a Being, as takes particular care of every one of us, and loves us, and delights to do us good; as under&s;tands all our Wants, and is able and willing to relieve us in our grea|te&s;t Straits, when nothing el&s;e can; to pre&s;erve us in our greate&s;t Dangers, to a&s;&s;i&s;t us again&s;t our wor&s;t Enemies, and to comfort us under

<P>After they have &s;aid all they can, na|tural Religion, without revealed, is not a &s;olid Foundation of Happine&s;s; be&s;ides, there ne|ver was any Age or Nation in the World, when or where &s;uch a pure natural Religion as they talk of, without any manner of rituous Wor|&s;hip, was ever practi&s;ed. I know not what &s;ecret Hi&s;tories the&s;e Gentlemen may have of the Golden Age; but as for us dull Believers, we can't &s;ee one word in all the ancient Books we meet withal, that gives us the lea&s;t Hint of &s;uch a naked natural Religion as you &s;peak of: If we have Recour&s;e to the Poets, to whom we are beholden for all that is known of the&s;e Golden Ages, when the&s;e brave Men lived; they make Religion as ritual as it is now, and altogether as full of Sacrifices and Revelations: Nay, the Account we have of the Godde&s;s <HI>A&s;traea,</HI> which is a principal Part of the poetical Hi&s;tory of the Golden Age, is, that &s;he was a <HI>Numen</HI> &s;ent from Heaven, to conver&s;e with Men on Earth, to in&s;pire them with Ju&s;tice and Sobriety, and to teach them Vertue and a good Life: Which Fable is but an antient Tradition of the Frequency of God's conver&s;ing with holy Men in the fir&s;t Ages of the World. Neither do we &s;ee any of the antient poetical Heroes, your <HI>Hercules</HI>'s and <HI>Pollux</HI>'s, your brave Natural-Religion Men; but they fre|quent

Sacrifices as much as other People; as we &s;ee by the Examples of <HI>Priam, &V;ly&s;&s;es, Achilles,</HI> and <HI>Aeneas</HI>; of <HI>Cadmus, Per&s;eus, The&s;eus,</HI> and all the <HI>Argonauts</HI> in <HI>Apollonius,</HI> and other Poets. So that we cannot but conclude, that the Story which the Dei&s;ts tell us of the antient Univer|&s;ality of pure Natural Religion, is all philo&s;o|phical Romance, and never had any Being but in the Brains of the Gentlemen of their Per&s;ua|&s;ion, and tho&s;e of &s;ome Sy&s;tem-Makers and Preachers of late, drawn from the &s;catter'd Sayings and Books of Philo&s;ophers.</P>

<P>Undoubtedly! Concerning which Method, <HI>Serino</HI> would expre&s;s him&s;elf after this Manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The next thing which a con&s;ider|ing Man has to do, after he has di&s;cover'd the In&s;ufficiency of Rea&s;on without Revelation, to make a Man happy, is to enquire into the Nature of tho&s;e Religions that lay claim to a divine Authority. If we take a &s;teddy View of the <HI>Pagan</HI> Scheme, we &s;hall find it &s;o over-run with Ignorance, Barbarity, and mon&s;trous Fiction, that any Per&s;on of to|lerable Parts, might &s;oon draw a better and more rational Plan; in which there is little tending to the Reverence of God, or the good of Man, to the promoting Virtue and Goodne&s;s in Human Conver&s;ation, to the

In a very blind and ob&s;cure Corner of the Earth, among a Crew of wild Thieves and Runa|gates, (&s;uch have tho&s;e <HI>Arabians</HI> been always famed and known to be) this Sect had its Birth and Fo&s;terage; among tho&s;e fierce and &s;avage Over-runners of the World, it got its Growth and Stature: Into this Sort of Peo|ple (being indeed in its Con&s;titution well accommodated to that Humour and Genius) it was partly in&s;inuated by jugling Tricks, and partly driven by &s;editious Violence; the fir&s;t Author hereof being a Per&s;on, according to the De&s;cription given of him in their own Legends, of no hone&s;t or honourable Qua|lities, but having all the Marks of an Impo&s;|tor, rebellious and per&s;idious, inhuman and

cruel, lewd and la&s;civious, of a ba&s;e Educa|tion, of a fraudulent and turbulent Di&s;po&s;i|tion, of a vicious Life, pretending to En|thu&s;ia&s;m, and working of Wonders; but the&s;e &s;uch as were in their Nature mo&s;t ab|&s;urd and incredible. At &s;uch a Sea&s;on, and in &s;uch a Soil, by &s;uch Means, and by &s;uch a Per&s;on, was this Religion fir&s;t planted, and afterwards carried on by the Sword. Now that divine Wi&s;dom &s;hould chu&s;e tho&s;e black and boi&s;terous Times to publi&s;h his Will, is as if the King &s;hould purpo&s;ely order his Proclamations to be made in a tempe&s;tuous Night, when no Man &s;carce dares to &s;tir out, nor could well &s;ee what was done, or hear what was &s;aid; much fitter &s;urely to that Purpo&s;e, were a &s;erene and calm Day, a Time of general Civility and Peace, like that of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar.</HI> That the Declaration of God's Mind &s;hould i&s;&s;ue from the De&s;arts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> (that Den of Robbers) is, as if the King &s;hould cau&s;e his Edicts to be &s;et up in the blinde&s;t and dirtie&s;t Nook of the Su|burbs; the Market-Cro&s;s &s;urely, or the Ex|change, (the Place of mo&s;t general and ordi|nary Concour&s;e) &s;uch as, in re&s;pect to the World, was the flouri&s;hing Empire of <HI>Rome,</HI> were more convenient, and wi&s;ely cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e: That pa&s;&s;ing over the more gentle and tractable Part of his People, a Prince &s;hould &s;end his Laws to a Rabble of

Their Gods were repre&s;ented as cruel, indigent, and lu&s;tful, &s;ubject to the meane&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions of Human Nature; nay, &s;ometimes to the lowe&s;t Inclinations of Brutes: What no|ble Objects of Adoration mu&s;t here be? What admirable Patterns of Sanctity and good Beha|viour? But Chri&s;tians are taught, from the holy Scriptures, to believe, that God is a Being of infinite Purity and Mercy. A &s;econd great Excellency, peculiar to the Chri&s;tian In&s;titu|tion, is this, That it faithfully informs us con|cerning our&s;elves, concerning our Nature, our Original, our End, all our State, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent,
<PB N="36" REF="45">
and final; Points about which otherwi&s;e by no Rea&s;on, no Hi&s;tory, no Experience, we could be well re&s;olved or &s;atisfied. It is al&s;o a pecu|liar Excellency of our Religion, that it pre&s;cribes an accurate Rule of Life, mo&s;t congruous to Rea&s;on, and &s;uitable to our Nature; it &s;ets be|fore us a living Copy, and vi&s;ible Standard of good Practice; it frees us from a tedious Ob|&s;ervance of numerous external Rites, and &s;uper|ficial Formalities, and builds our Duty upon mo&s;t &s;olid Grounds, pre&s;&s;es it with mo&s;t valid Inducements, draweth it from the be&s;t Princi|ples, and driveth it to the be&s;t End, and far|ther (which no other Law or Doctrine &s;o much as pretends to) provides &s;ufficient Help and A|bility to practi&s;e its Commandments: In a word, it alone can appea&s;e and &s;atisfy a Man's Con&s;cience, breeding therein a well-grounded Hope, and a &s;olid Comfort; healing the Wounds of bitter Remor&s;e, and anxious Fear, and &s;o appears manife&s;tly to be the true and direct Way to eternal Happine&s;s. It is ob&s;ervable al&s;o, that the &s;acred Oracles furni&s;h us with the mo&s;t aw|ful De&s;criptions of God's Power and Maje&s;ty, quite different from that Tin&s;el Pageantry, which &s;o glitters in the Machines of the Hea|then Poets.

He has more than once expre&s;&s;ed his Approbation of the Conduct of the <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> in this Particular, That they &s;pare no Co&s;ts to adorn their Church|es; which, however, weak Minds may call a u&s;ele&s;s Pageantry, yet &s;eems very agreeable to tho&s;e Notions, which both Nature and Reve|lation give us of the Divine Maje&s;ty.

He was a very great Admirer of the antient Fathers, and did by no Means approve of the Opinion of &s;ome modern Divines (otherwi&s;e Men of good Judgment) who &s;et too light by tho&s;e venerable Remains of pious Antiquity. He &s;eemed, in a more particular manner, to be delighted with the Writings of <HI>Origen</HI> and St. <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom,</HI> tho' divers Authors, very injuri|ou&s;ly, place the former in their Catalogues of

That he was conver&s;ant in the Works of <HI>Crellius, Volkelius,</HI> and others of that Clan, was not with any De|&s;ign to fall into their Scheme; but only to furni&s;h him&s;elf with &s;ome valuable Flowers that were di&s;per&s;ed among numerous Weeds.

Doctrines were as agreeable to the Apo|&s;tolical and Primitive Rules, as any whatever; and was particularly plea&s;ed with that charming Air of Meekne&s;s, and Charity, which u&s;ually adorns even their Polemical Writings.

Athei&s;tical Wits very often complain of the Meanne&s;s of the Style of Holy Writ; let them

Another favou|rite Author of my dear Friend's, was the ad|mired <HI>Grotius:</HI> He had, al&s;o in his Library, a compleat Set of <HI>Calvin</HI>'s Works, in which, &s;ome|times, he would &s;pend an Hour or two; but tho&s;e har&s;h Po&s;itions, and un&s;criptural A&s;&s;erti|ons, which he there frequently met with con|cerning God's Decrees, made him only con&s;ult them occa&s;ionally, and not with that Plea&s;ure which otherwi&s;e he might have found in the Writings of a Divine, who was very con&s;ide|rable in many other Re&s;pects. He thought his Doctrine of ab&s;olute Reprobation, wholly in|con&s;i&s;tent with all the Attributes of God, and labouring under mon&s;trous Ab&s;urdities. Is it po&s;&s;ible that the God of infinite Mercy, &s;hould re&s;olve from all Eternity, upon the De&s;tructi|on of the far greater Part of Mankind, and yet call upon them, with the mo&s;t moving Tender|ne&s;s, to accept of Happine&s;s?

his Acquaintance, who u&s;ed almo&s;t to drown tho&s;e laudable Qualities they were Ma&s;ters of, in Floods of Wine, and &s;pent a great deal of Time in exce&s;&s;ive Drinking; which Vice has very fatal Effects on the Mind of the Per&s;on who is devoted to it, not to &s;ay that it al&s;o wa&s;tes his Body, and di&s;&s;ipates his Fortune: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For (as a polite Gentleman very well ob|&s;erves)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See, a <HI>Spectator</HI> of Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>'s.</NOTE> as to the Mind, Drunkenne&s;s di&s;|covers every Flaw in it: The &s;ober Man, by the Strength of Rea&s;on, may keep un|der, and &s;ubdue every Vice or Folly, to which he is mo&s;t inclined; but Wine makes every latent Seed &s;prout up in the Soul, and &s;hew it&s;elf: It gives Fury to the Pa&s;&s;ions, and Force to tho&s;e Objects which are apt to produce them.

this Vice only betray the hidden Faults of a Man, and &s;hew them in the mo&s;t odious Colours, but often occa&s;ions Faults, to which he is not naturally &s;ubject. There is more of Turn than of Truth in a Saying of <HI>Se|neca,</HI> That Drunkenne&s;s does not produce, but di&s;cover Faults; common Experience teaches us the contrary. Wine throws a Man out of him&s;elf, and infu&s;es Qualities into the Mind, which &s;he is a Stranger to in her &s;ober Moments. The Per&s;on you con|ver&s;e with after the third Bottle, is not the &s;ame Man who at fir&s;t &s;at down at Table with you. Upon this Maxim is founded a pretty Saying of <HI>Publius Syrus</HI>; <Q REND="inline"><HI>Qui ebrium ludificat, laedit ab&s;entem:</HI></Q> He who je&s;ts upon a Man who is drunk, injures the Ab&s;ent.

But be&s;ides the&s;e ill Effects which this Vice produces in the Per&s;on who is actually under its Dominion, it has al&s;o a bad Influence on the Mind, even in its &s;ober Moments; as it in&s;en&s;ibly weakens the Un|der&s;tanding, impairs the Memory, and makes tho&s;e Faults habitual, which are produced by frequent Exce&s;&s;es."</Q> <HI>Serino</HI> was well aware of this, and therefore &s;trictly guarded

again&s;t all Exce&s;&s;es of this kind. Another pre|vailing Vice of the Age, which he kept at a Di&s;tance from, and was extreamly unea&s;y when in any Company where it was practi&s;ed, was the modi&s;h Rant of Oaths and Imprecations, it being an ungenteel Dialect, as well as un|chri&s;tian, and cla&s;hes both with the Rules of Breeding, and the Go&s;pel. The Folly of them is thus admirably de&s;cribed by a con&s;iderable Ma&s;ter of Learning and Language: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cu&s;tom, indeed (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) has made them fa&s;hionable, but neither civil nor lawful; for Vice can never plead Pre&s;cription: I know it lies un|der the Protection of Numbers and Quali|ty; but ill Things have no Right to San|ctuary. Becau&s;e Vermin &s;warm, mu&s;t they be permitted to Increa&s;e? Shall the Number of Felons plead for Pardon? No, no; the Cu&s;tomarine&s;s of ill Things makes them wor&s;e, and the more they mu&s;t be di&s;coun|tenanced, and taught Di&s;cipline. In a word, whatever jars with Religion, and cuts upon good Breeding, is below a Gentleman; and therefore, in &s;pight of Example and Practice, I mu&s;t caution young Gentlemen again&s;t &s;ome Parts of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Civility; for though they go for Con&s;ent in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Domini|ons, they will not bear the Te&s;t of other Nations. For Example: <HI>Damn ye,</HI> &s;ays one, <HI>I am glad to &s;ee you.</HI> Is not this a quaint Sa|lutation, fir&s;t to pack me away to Hell, and

then prote&s;t he is glad to &s;ee me &s;o conveni|ently lodged? What Provi&s;ion will the&s;e Blades make for their Enemies, if they place their Friends &s;o untowardly? Certainly they fancy Hell is a fine Seat, and that the Damned are in a fair Way of Promotion. <HI>Damn ye, ye Dog, how do&s;t do?</HI> Cries another: This feat Compliment implies Damnation and Transformation too; it's a Compound of Cur&s;e and Raillery, I am plunged into Hell, da&s;hed out of the Li&s;t of Rationals, and then with a Taunt asked how I do. Why, a Man in Fire and Brim&s;tone is not altoge|ther at his Ea&s;e; and a rea&s;onable Creature, cur&s;t into a Dog, not very fond of the Me|tamorpho&s;is. A third very ungenteelly ac|co&s;ts a Friend, he has not, perhaps, &s;een of a Twelve-month; <HI>Ye Son of a Whore, where have you been?</HI> This is an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Addre&s;s to a tittle; it is a kind of Staple Commodi|ty of the Nation, and, like our Wooll, mu&s;t not be tran&s;ported, under Pain of Confi&s;ca|tion. But &s;urely we need not lay &s;o &s;evere an Embargo on the Ware, for 'tis ten to one 'twill never find vent in any other Na|tion on this Side of the <HI>Canaries</HI>; a handful of Dirt, well applied, is as civil a Compli|ment, though not quite &s;o cleanly. <HI>Son of a Whore!</HI> There is Abundance of Freedom in the Expre&s;&s;ion, but not a Grain of Breed|ing; unle&s;s you mea&s;ure Behaviour by the

For Whore &s;tands for a Mark of Qua|lity, a di&s;tingui&s;hing Character; otherwi&s;e the Salutation would appear coar&s;e and home|ly: But, by their leave, few are in Love with Cro&s;s-bars, and to be Brother to a Bye-blow, is to be a Ba&s;tard once removed. I know we fling a Veil on the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, and wa&s;h over their Foulne&s;s with fair Pre|tences. <HI>Damn ye</HI> (&s;ays one) and <HI>Son of a Whore</HI> &s;tand merely for Cyphers, or only &s;erve to enliven a Period, and to make the Expre&s;&s;ion more blu&s;tering: I confe&s;s Whore and Damnation are near a-kin, and often go together; but for all that, the Silline&s;s of the Excu&s;e, can't &s;tifle the mon&s;trous Inci|vility of the Compliment; for though it &s;ignifies nothing to him who receives it, in good time it will &s;ignify much to him who &s;poke it; for though a Friend may let &s;uch Cur&s;es fall to the Ground, God will put them to Account; and though they &s;tand for Cyphers in <HI>England,</HI> they may purcha&s;e Eternal Torments in Hell. They are, &s;ays another, Marks of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Familiarity; pure Sallies of Kindne&s;s, and Demon&s;trations of Friend&s;hip.

<PB N="61" REF="70">
with a Vengeance; but at which End of the Compliment is his Kindne&s;s? In &s;hort, &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions grate the Organ, and turn the very Faculty of Hearing into a Burthen; they are high Symptoms of a lewd Inclina|tion, and of a depraved Complexion; for when the Breath &s;mells rank, the Stomach is infected: In &s;hort, &s;uch a Jargon is a Breach of Civility, it is a ru&s;tick Cant, an uncredirable Dialect; nor is the whole Po&s;&s;e of Bullies able to enoble it".</Q> Per&s;ons of great Fortunes, are tempted to Pride and Haughtine&s;s; therefore <HI>Serino</HI> laboured by all Means to obtain that excellent Virtue of Hu|mility: And was &s;o happy as not to mi&s;s of his De&s;ign, nor lo&s;e his Labour; for, I be|lieve, no Man, in his Circum&s;tances, was ever of a more meek and humble Spirit. There is an admirable Sentence in Holy Writ, which &s;ays, that <HI>Pride was not made for Man:</HI> There is not, indeed, any &s;ingle View of Human Nature, under its pre&s;ent Condition, which is not &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h in us all the &s;ecret Seeds of Pride; and on the contrary, to &s;ink the Soul into the lowe&s;t State of Humility, and what the School-men call Self-Annihilation: There is nothing in his Under&s;tanding, his Will, or in his pre&s;ent Condition, that can tempt any con&s;iderate Creature to Pride or Va|nity; and yet the very Rea&s;ons why he &s;hould not be proud, are, notwith&s;tanding, the Rea|&s;ons
<PB N="62" REF="71">
why he is &s;o. Were he not a &s;inful Crea|ture, he would not be &s;ubject to a Pa&s;&s;ion which ri&s;es from the Depravity of his Nature; were he not an ignorant Creature, he would &s;ee he has nothing to be proud of: And were not the whole Species mi&s;erable, he would not have tho&s;e wretched Objects of Compari&s;on before his Eyes, which are the Occa&s;ions of this Pa&s;&s;ion, and make one Man value him&s;elf more than another. But, methinks, the In|&s;tability of Human Affairs, the Turns and Vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of Fortune, and the &s;udden Falls from the mo&s;t &s;woln Ambition, are Subjects which ought to di&s;countenance Pride. <HI>Shake&s;peare</HI> has an admirable Pa&s;&s;age on this Head, (&s;poken by <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII.) which <HI>Serino</HI> u&s;ed of|ten to repeat.<Q><L>Farewel; a long Farewel to all my Greatne&s;s!</L>
