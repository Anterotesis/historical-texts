Now to the Public tune my grateful lays,</L>
<L>Warm'd with the &s;un-&s;hine of the Public prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Warm'd too with mem'ry of that golden time,</L>
<L>When Almon gave me rea&s;on for my rhyme;</L>
<L>&mdash;glittering orbs, and, what endear'd them more,</L>
<L N="10">Each glittering orb the &s;acred features bore</L>
<L>Of George the good, the gracious, and the great,</L>
<L>Unfil'd, un&s;weated, all of &s;terling weight;</L>
<L>Or, were they not, they pa&s;s'd with current ea&s;e,</L>
<L>Good &s;eemings then were good realities:</L>

<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver&s;e 19. [And find him wanting.] Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. Daniel, chap. 8, v. 27.</P></NOTE>And find him wanting: all &s;ave me alone,</L>
<L N="20">For, &s;ad to &s;ay! my glittering orbs are gone.</L>
<L>But ill be&s;eems a Poet to repent,</L>
<L>Lightly they came, and full as lightly went.</L>
<L>Peace to their manes! may they never feel</L>
<L>Some keen Scotch banker's unrelenting &s;teel;</L>
<L N="25">While I again the Mu&s;e's &s;ickle bring</L>
<L>To cut down Dunces, where&s;oe'er they &s;pring,</L>
<L>Bind in poetic &s;heaves the plenteous crop,</L>
<L>And &s;tack my full-ear'd load in Almon's &s;hop.</L>
<L>For now, my Mu&s;e, thy fame is fixt as fate,</L>

Did China's monarch here in Britain doze,</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver&s;e 34. [A King of Pro&s;e.] Kien-Long, the pre&s;ent Emperor of China is a poet. M. de Voltaire did him the honour to treat him as a brother above two years ago; and my late patron, Sir William Chambers, has given a fine and mo&s;t intelligible pro&s;e ver&s;ion of an ode of his Maje&s;ty upon tea, in his po&s;t&s;cript to his Di&s;&s;ertation. I am, how|ever, vain enough to think, that the Emperor's compo&s;ition would have appeared &s;till bet|ter in my heroic ver&s;e; but Sir William fore&s;talled it; on which account I have entirely broke with him.</P></NOTE>And was, like we&s;tern Kings, a King of Pro&s;e,</L>
<L N="35">Thy &s;ong could cure his A&s;iatic &s;pleen,</L>
<L>And make him wi&s;h to &s;ee and to be &s;een;</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver&s;e 37. [That &s;olemn vein of irony.] "A &s;ine vein of &s;olemn irony runs through this piece." See <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> under the article of the Heroic Epi&s;tle to Sir William Chambers.</P></NOTE>That &s;olemn vein of irony &s;o fine,</L>

<L>Perchance to proud Spithead's imperial bay;</L>
<L><NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>Ver&s;e 43. [There &s;hould he &s;ee.] A certain naval event happened ju&s;t about two calendar months after the publication of the Heroic Epi&s;tle. 'Twas impo&s;&s;ible, con&s;ider|ing the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, it could have been &s;ooner. Facts are &s;tubborn things.</P></NOTE>There &s;hould he &s;ee, as other folks have &s;een,</L>
<L>That &s;hips have anchors, and that &s;eas are green,</L>
<L N="45">Should own the tackling trim, the &s;treamers fine,</L>
<L>With Sandwich prattle, and with Brad&s;haw dine,</L>
<L>And then &s;ail back, amid the cannon's roar,</L>
<L>As &s;afe, as &s;age, as when he left the &s;hore.</L>
<L>Such is thy pow'r, O Godde&s;s of the &s;ong,</L>
<L N="50">Come then and guide my carele&s;s pen along;</L>

Yet keep it in the bounds of &s;en&s;e and ver&s;e,</L>

<L>No, let the flow of the&s;e &s;pontaneous rhymes</L>
<L>So truly touch the temper of the times,</L>
<L N="55">That he who runs may read; while well he knows</L>
<L>I write in metre, what he thinks in pro&s;e;</L>
<L>So &s;hall my &s;ong, undi&s;ciplin'd by art,</L>

<L>If this it's fate, let all the frippery things</L>
<L N="60">Be-plac'd, be-pen&s;ion'd, and be-&s;tarr'd by Kings,</L>

[Fannius.] Before I &s;ent the M. S. to the pre&s;s, I di&s;covered, that an ac|cidental blot had made all but the fir&s;t &s;yllable of this name illegible. I was doubtful, therefore, whether to print it Fannius or Fannia. After much deliberation, I thought it be&s;t to u&s;e the ma&s;culine termination. If I have done wrong, I a&s;k pardon, not only of the Author, but the Lady. <HI>The Editor.</HI></P>

</NOTE>Frown on the page, and with fa&s;tidious eye,</L>
<L>Like old young Fannius, call it bla&s;phemy.</L>
