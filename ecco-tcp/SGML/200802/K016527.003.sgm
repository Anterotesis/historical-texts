<HEAD><HI>LETTER I.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>HARRIET BYRON,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>LUCY SELBY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, March <HI>18.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SELF, my dear Lucy, is a very wicked thing; a &s;anctifier, if one would give way to its partialities, of actions, which, in others, we &s;hould have no doubt to con|demn. DELICACY, too, is often a mi&s;leader; an idol at who&s;e &s;hrine we &s;ometimes offer up oar Sincerity; but, in that ca&s;e, it &s;hould be called <HI>In|delicacy.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing, &s;urely, can be delicate, that is not true, or that gives birth to equivocation: Yet how was I plea&s;ed with Lord and Lady L. and Mi&s;s Crandi&s;on, for endeavouring to pa&s;s me off to good Dr. Bartlett in the light I had no title to appear in!&mdash;As if my mind, in a certain point, remained to be known;
<PB N="2" REF="3">
and would &s;o remain, till the gentleman had di&s;co|vered his.</P>
<P>And are there &s;ome &s;ituations, in which a woman mu&s;t conceal her true &s;entiments? In which it would be thought immode&s;ty to &s;peak out?&mdash;Why was I born with an heart &s;o open and &s;incere? But why, indeed, as Sir Charles has &s;aid in his Letter relating to the Danby's, &s;hould women be blamed, for owning mode&s;tly a pa&s;&s;ion for a worthy and &s;uitable object? Is it, that they will not &s;peak out, le&s;t, if their wi&s;hes &s;hould not be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s by <HI>one</HI> man, they &s;hould deprive them&s;elves of a chance to &s;ucceed with <HI>another?</HI> Do they not propo&s;e to make the man they love, happy?&mdash;And is it a crime to acknowlege, that they are &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to a <HI>worthy</HI> object? A <HI>wor|thy</HI> object, I repeat; for that is what will warrant the open heart. What a littlene&s;s is there in the cu&s;tom that compels us to be in&s;incere? And &s;uppo&s;e we do not &s;ucceed with a fir&s;t object, &s;hall we cheat a future Lover with the notion that <HI>he</HI> was the fir&s;t?</P>
<P>Hitherto I had acted with &s;ome &s;elf-approbation: I told Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick, Mr. Orme, Mr. Fowler, that I had not &s;een the man to whom I could wi&s;h to give my hand at the altar: But when I found my heart engaged, I was de&s;irous Lady D. &s;hould know that it was. But yet, mi&s;led by this &s;ame no|tion of delicacy, I could think my&s;elf obliged to the two &s;i&s;ters, and my Lord, that they endeavoured to throw a blind over the eyes of good Dr. Bartlett: When the right mea&s;ure, I now think, would have been, not to have endeavoured to obtain lights from him, that we all thought he was not commi&s;&s;ioned to give; or, if we had, to have related to him the whole truth, and not have put on di&s;gui&s;es to him; but to have le&s;t him wholly a judge of the fit, and the unfit.</P>
<P>And this is LOVE, is it? that puts an hone&s;t girl upon approving of &s;uch tricks?&mdash;Begone, Love! I
<PB N="3" REF="4">
bani&s;h thee if thou would&s;t corrupt the &s;implicity of that heart, which was taught to glory in truth.</P>
<P>And yet, I had like to have been drawn into a greater fault: For, What do you think?&mdash;Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on had (by &s;ome means or other; &s;he would not tell me how) in Dr. Bartlett's ab&s;ence on a vi&s;it to one of the Canons of Wind&s;or, got at a letter brought early this morning from her brother to that good man, and which he had left opened on his de&s;k.</P>
<P>Here, Harriet, &s;aid &s;he, is the letter &s;o lately brought, not perhaps quite hone&s;tly come at, from my brother to Dr. Bartlett (holding it out to me). You are warmly mentioned in it. Shall I put it where I had it? Or will you &s;o far partake of my fault as to read it fir&s;t?</P>
<P>O Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! &s;aid I: And <HI>am</HI> I warmly men|tioned in it? Pray oblige me with the peru&s;al of it. And I held out my more than half guilty hand, and took it: But (immediately recollecting my&s;elf) did you not hint that you came at it by means not ho|ne&s;t?&mdash;Take it again; I will not partake of your fault.&mdash;But, cruel Charlotte! how could you tempt me &s;o? And I laid it on a chair.</P>
<P>Read the fir&s;t paragraph, Harriet. She took it up, unfolded it, and pointed to the fir&s;t paragraph.</P>
<P>Tempter! &s;aid I, how can you wi&s;h me to imitate our fir&s;t pattern! And down I &s;at, and put both my hands before my eyes. Take it away, take it away, while yet I am innocent! Dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, don't give me cau&s;e for &s;elf-reproach. I will not par|take of your <HI>acknowledged</HI> fault.</P>
<P>She read a line or two; and then &s;aid, Shall I read farther, Harriet? The very next word is your name. I will&mdash;</P>
<P>No, no, no, &s;aid I, putting my fingers in my ears.&mdash;Yet, had you come hone&s;tly by it, I &s;hould have longed to read it&mdash;By what means&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
Why, if people will leave their clo&s;et-doors open, let them take the con&s;equence.</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> people will do &s;o&mdash;But was it &s;o?&mdash;And yet, if it was, would <HI>you</HI> be willing to have your letters look|ed into?</P>
<P>Well then, I will carry it back&mdash;Shall I? (holding it out to me) Shall I, Harriet?&mdash;I will put it where I had it&mdash;Shall I? And twice or thrice went from me, and came back to me with a provoking archne&s;s in her looks.</P>
<P>Only tell me, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, is there any-thing in it that you think your brother would not have us &s;ee?&mdash;But I am &s;ure there is, or the obliging Dr. Bartlett, who has &s;hewn us others, would have fa|voured us with communicating the contents of this.</P>
<P>I would not but have &s;een this letter for half I am worth! O Harriet! there are <HI>&s;uch</HI> things in it.&mdash;Bo|logna! Paris! Grandi&s;on-hall!</P>
<P>Be gone, Siren: Letters are &s;acred things. Re|place it&mdash;Don't you own, that you came not hone&s;tly by it?&mdash;And yet&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah! Lucy, I was ready to yield to the curio&s;ity &s;he had rai&s;ed: But, recollecting my&s;elf, Be gone, &s;aid I: Carry back the letter: I am afraid of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Why, Harriet, here is one pa&s;&s;age, the contents of which you mu&s;t be acquainted with in a very little while&mdash;</P>
<P>I will not be tempted, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. I will &s;tay till it is communicated to me, be it what it will.</P>
<P>But you may be &s;urpri&s;ed, Harriet, at the time, and know not what an&s;wer to give to it.&mdash;You had as good read it&mdash;Here, take it&mdash;Was there ever &s;uch a &s;cru|pulous creature?&mdash;It is about you and Emily&mdash;</P>
<P>About me and Emily! O Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, What can there be about me and Emily?</P>
<P>And where's the difference, Harriet, between a&s;k|ing me a out the contents, and reading them?&mdash;But I ll tell you&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
No, you &s;hall not: I will not hear the contents. I never will a&s;k you. Can nobody act greatly but your brother? Let you and I, Charlotte, be the better for his example. You &s;hall neither read them, nor tell me of them. I would not be &s;o u&s;ed my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Such prai&s;es did I never hear of woman!&mdash;Oh, Harriet!&mdash;Such prai&s;es&mdash;</P>
<P>Prai&s;es, Charlotte!&mdash;From your brother?&mdash;O this curio&s;ity! the fir&s;t fault of our fir&s;t parent! But I will not be tempted. If you provoke me to a&s;k que&s;tions, laugh at me, and welcome: But I be&s;eech you, an|&s;wer me not. Dear creature, if you love me, replace the letter; and do not &s;eek to make me mean in my own eyes.</P>
<P>How you reflect upon me, Harriet!&mdash;But let me a&s;k you, Are you willing, as a third &s;i&s;ter, to take Emily into your guardian&s;hip, and carry her down with you into Northampton&s;hire?&mdash;An&s;wer me that.</P>
<P>Ah! Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! And is there &s;uch a propo|&s;al as that mentioned?&mdash;But an&s;wer me not, I be|&s;eech you. Whatever propo&s;al is intended to be made me, let it be made: It will be too &s;oon, whenever that is, if it be a di&s;agreeable one.</P>
<P>But let me &s;ay, madam (and tears were in my eyes) that I will not be treated with indignity by the be&s;t man on earth. And while I can refu&s;e to yield to a thing that I think unworthy of my&s;elf (you are a &s;i&s;ter, madam, and have nothing either to hope or fear) I have a title to act with &s;pirit, when occa&s;ions call for it.</P>
<P>My dear, you are &s;erious&mdash;Twice <HI>madam,</HI> in one breath! I will not forgive you. You ought now to hear that pa&s;&s;age read, which relates to you and Emily, if you will not read it your&s;elf.</P>
<P>And &s;he was looking for it; I &s;uppo&s;e intending to read it to me.</P>
<P>No, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;aid I, laying my &s;pread hand upon the letter; I will neither read it, nor hear it
<PB N="6" REF="7">
read. I begin to apprehend, that there will be oc|ca&s;ion for me to exert all my fortitude; and while it is yet in my power to do a right or wrong thing, I will not deprive my&s;elf of the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having <HI>merited</HI> well, whatever may be my lot&mdash;Excu&s;e me, madam.</P>
<P>I went to the door and was opening it&mdash;when &s;he ran to me&mdash;Dear creature! you are angry with me: But how that pride becomes you! There is a dignity in it that awes me. O Harriet! how infinitely does it become the only woman in the world, that is wor|thy of the be&s;t man in it! Only &s;ay, you are not an|gry with me. Say that you can and do forgive me.</P>
<P>Forgive you, my Charlotte I&mdash;I do. But can you &s;ay, that you came not hone&s;tly by that letter, and yet forgive your&s;elf? But, my dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, in&s;tantly replace it; and do you watch over me, like a true friend, if in a future hour of weakne&s;s you &s;hould find me de&s;irous to know any of the contents of a paper &s;o naughtily come at. I own that I had like to have been overcome: And if I had, all the in|formation it would have given me, could never have recompen&s;ed me for what I &s;hould have &s;uffered in my own opinion, when I reflected on the means by which I had obtained it.</P>
<P>Superior creature! how you &s;hame me! I will re|place the letter. And I promi&s;e you, that if I cannot forget the contents of it my&s;elf (and yet they are glo|rious to my brother) I will never mention any of them to you; unle&s;s the letter be fairly communicated to you, and to us all.</P>
<P>I threw my arms about her neck. She fervently returned the &s;i&s;terly embrace. We &s;eparated; &s;he retiring at one door, in order to go up to replace the letter; I at the other, to re-con&s;ider all that had pa&s;|&s;ed on the occa&s;ion. And I hope I &s;hall love her the better for taking &s;o kindly a behaviour &s;o contrary to what her own had been.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Well, but, don't you congratulate me, my dear, on my e&s;cape from my curio&s;ity? I am &s;ure my grand|mamma, and my aunt, will be plea&s;ed with their girl. Yet it was an hard &s;truggle, I own: In the &s;u&s;pen&s;e I am in; a very hard &s;truggle. But tho' wi&s;hes will play about my heart, that I knew &s;uch of the con|tents as it might concern me to know; yet I am infi|nitely better plea&s;ed that I yielded not to the temp|tation, than I &s;hould have been, if I had. And then, methinks, my pride is gratified in the &s;uperiority this lady a&s;cribes to me over her&s;elf, whom &s;o lately I thought greatly my &s;uperior.</P>
<P>Yet what merit have I in this? Since if I had con|&s;idered only rules of policy, I &s;hould have been ut|terly wrong, had I yielded to the temptation: For what u&s;e could I have made of any knowlege I might have obtained by this means? If any propo&s;al is to be made me, of what nature &s;oever, it mu&s;t, in that ca&s;e, have appeared to be quite new to me: And what an affectation mu&s;t that have occa&s;ioned, what di&s;&s;i|mulation, in your Harriet?&mdash;And how would a crea|ture, educated as I have been, have behaved under &s;uch trials as might have ari&s;en from a knowledge &s;o faultily obtained?</P>
<P>And had I been di&s;covered; had I given cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion, either to Dr. Bartlett, or Sir Charles; I &s;hould have appeared as the principal in the fact: It would have been mean to accu&s;e Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, as the tempter, in a temptation yielded to with my eyes open. And &s;hould I not have ca&s;t a &s;lur upon that curio&s;ity which Dr. Barlett before had not refu&s;ed to gratify, as well as &s;hut my&s;elf out from all future communications and confidence?</P>
<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible, be&s;ides, that, unu&s;ed as I have been to artifice and di&s;gui&s;e, I &s;hould have betrayed my&s;elf; e&s;pecially had I found any of the contents of the letter very affecting.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee, Lucy, that policy, as well as recti|tude
<PB N="8" REF="9">
of manners, ju&s;tify me: And in this particular I am an happy girl.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on has ju&s;t now told her &s;i&s;ter what pa&s;&s;ed between us. Lady L. &s;ays, &s;he would not have been Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, in taking the letter, by what means &s;oever come at; for how, &s;aid &s;he, did I know what &s;ecrets there might be in it, before I read it? But I think verily, when it <HI>had</HI> been got at, and of|fered me, I could not have been Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>And &s;he threw her arms about me, and hugged me to her. Dear creature, &s;aid &s;he, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be Lady Grandi&s;on&mdash;<HI>Mu&s;t!</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: She <HI>&s;hall.</HI></P>
<P>Who, Lucy, whether that may ever come to pa&s;s, or not, would not, on reflection (thus approved by both &s;i&s;ters) rejoice that &s;he conquered her curio&s;ity, and acted as &s;he did?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on talked to Lady L. of its being likely that her brother would go to Bologna: Of a vi&s;it he is &s;oon to make to Grandi&s;on-hall; and &s;he to go with him: Of his going to Paris, in order to &s;ettle &s;ome matters relating to the Will of his late friend Mr. Danby&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, Lucy, my time in town is ha&s;tening to its period. Why am I not reminded, that my three al|lotted months are near expired? Will you receive the poor girl, who perhaps will not be able to carry down with her the heart &s;he brought up? And yet, to go down to &s;uch dear friends without it, what an un|grateful &s;ound has that!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on began to talk of other &s;ubjects re|lating to her brother, and tho&s;e greatly to his prai&s;e. I could have heard all &s;he had to &s;ay with infinite plea|&s;ure. I <HI>do</HI> love to hear him prai&s;ed. But, as I doubted not but the&s;e &s;ubjects aro&s;e from the letter &s;o &s;urrep|titiou&s;ly obtained, I re&s;trained my&s;elf, and withdrew.</P>
<P>OF what an happy temper is Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! She was much affected with the &s;cene that pa&s;&s;ed between
<PB N="9" REF="10">
us, but all is over with her already. One le&s;&s;on upon her harp&s;ichord &s;ets every-thing right with her. She has been raillying Lord L. with as much life and &s;pi|rit, as if &s;he had done nothing to be vexed at. Had I been induced by her to read the letter which &s;he got at di&s;hone&s;tly, as &s;he owned, what a poor figure &s;hould I have made in my own eyes, for a month to come!</P>
<P>But did &s;he not as &s;oon overcome the mortification given her by her brother, on the detection of captain Ander&s;on's affair? How unmercifully did &s;he railly me, within a few hours after!&mdash;Yet, &s;he has fine qua|lities. One cannot help loving her. I <HI>do</HI> love her. But is it not a weakne&s;s to look without abatement of affection on tho&s;e faults in one per&s;on, which we &s;hould hold utterly inexcu&s;able in another? In Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on's ca&s;e, however, don't &s;ay it is, Lucy. O what a partiality! Yet &s;he has within the&s;e few minutes owned, that &s;he thought the &s;tep &s;he had taken a faulty one, before &s;he came to me with the letter; and hoped to induce me to countenance her in what &s;he had done.</P>
<P>I called her a little Satan on this occa&s;ion. But, after all, what if the dear Charlotte's curio&s;ity was more for my &s;ake than her own? No motive of friend&s;hip, you will &s;ay, can ju&s;tify a wrong action&mdash;Why no, Lucy; that is very true; but if you knew Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on, you would love her dearly.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>[The Letter which Mi&s;s Byron refu&s;ed to read, or hear read.]</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday Night, Mar. <HI>17.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE my Lord L. and my &s;i&s;ters will be able to make Colnebrooke &s;o agreeable to Mi&s;s Byron
<PB N="10" REF="11">
that I may have the plea&s;ure of finding her there in the beginning of the week.</P>
<P>My lord W. is in town. He has invited me to dine with him to-morrow; and mu&s;t not be denied, was a part of his me&s;&s;age, brought me by Halden his &s;teward, who &s;ays, That his lord&s;hip has &s;omething of con&s;equence to con&s;ult me upon.</P>
<P>When, my dear friend, &s;hall I find time for my|&s;elf? Pray make my compliments to my Lord L. and to my <HI>three</HI> &s;i&s;ters; and tell them from me, that when I have the happine&s;s of being in <HI>their</HI> company, then it is that I think I give time to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have a letter from Bologna: From the faithful Camilla. The contents of it give me great concern. She urges me to make one more vi&s;it there. She tells me, that the Bi&s;hop &s;aid in her hearing, it would be <HI>kind</HI> if I would. Were &s;uch a vi&s;it to be reque&s;ted <HI>ge|nerally;</HI> and it were likely to be of &s;ervice; you may believe that I would chearfully make it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould go, for a fortnight at lea&s;t, to Grandi&s;on|hall. Burge&s;s has let me know, that the workmen have gone almo&s;t as far as they can go without my further orders. And the churchwardens have &s;ignified to me, that the church is completely beautified, ac|cording to my directions; &s;o that it will be ready to be opened on the Sunday after next, at farthe&s;t; and intreat my pre&s;ence, both as patron, and benefactor. I will now ha&s;ten my de&s;igned alterations at the Hall.</P>
<P>I had rather not be pre&s;ent at the opening. Yet the propriety of my being there will probably prevail upon me to comply with the intreaties of the church|wardens; who in their letter &s;ignify the expectations of Sir Samuel Clarke, Sir William Turner, and Mr. Barnham, of &s;eeing me, and my &s;i&s;ter Charlotte. You will be plea&s;ed to mention this to her.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, without putting a &s;light upon good Mr. Dob&s;on, that <HI>you,</HI> my dear friend, could oblige us with the fir&s;t &s;ermon. All then would be decent, and
<PB N="11" REF="12">
worthy of the occa&s;ion; and the prai&s;e would be given <HI>properly,</HI> and not to the <HI>agent.</HI> But as it would be a little mortifying to Mr. Dob&s;on (of who&s;e prai&s;e only I am apprehen&s;ive) &s;o much as to hint &s;uch a wi&s;h, I will write to him, that he will oblige me if he &s;ay not one word, that &s;hall carry the eyes of the audi|ence to my &s;eat.</P>
<P>The execution of the orders I gave, that five other pews &s;hould be equally di&s;tingui&s;hed and ornamented with mine, carries not with it the appearance of affectation; does it, my good Dr. Bartlett? e&s;pecially as &s;o many con&s;iderable families have &s;eats there? I would not &s;eem guilty of a fal&s;e mode&s;ty, which, breaking out into &s;ingularity, would give the &s;u&s;picion of a wrong direction, in ca&s;es where it may be of u&s;e to &s;uppo&s;e a right one.</P>
<P>What can I do in relation to my Emily? She is of the &s;tature of woman. She ought, according to the pre&s;ent ta&s;te, to be introduced into public life. I am not fond of that life. And what knowlege &s;he will gain by the introduction, &s;he had better be without. Yet I think we &s;hould conform &s;omething to the ta&s; e of the times in which we live. Women's minds have generally a lighter turn than tho&s;e of men. They &s;hould be innocently indulged. And on this principle it was, that la&s;t winter I attended her, and my &s;i&s;ters, very often to the places of public entertainment; that &s;he, having &s;een every-thing that was the ge|neral &s;ubject of polite conver&s;ation, might judge of &s;uch entertainments as they de&s;erve; and not add ex|pectation (which runs very high in young minds, and is &s;eldom an&s;wered) to the ideal &s;eenes. This indul|gence an&s;wered as I wi&s;h. Emily can now hear talk of the emulation of actors and managers, and of the other public diver&s;ions, with tranquillity; and be &s;a|tisfied, as &s;he reads, with repre&s;enting over again to her&s;elf the parts in which the particular actors excelled. And thus a boundary is &s;et to her imagination; and
<PB N="12" REF="13">
that by her own choice; for &s;he thinks lightly of them, when &s;he can be obliged by the company of my two &s;i&s;ters and Lord L.</P>
<P>But new &s;cenes will ari&s;e, in an age &s;o &s;tudious as this, to gratify the eye and the ear. From the&s;e a young woman of fortune mu&s;t not be totally excluded. I am a young man; and as Emily is &s;o well grown for her years, I think I cannot &s;o properly be her in|troducer to them, as I might, were I fifteen or twen|ty years older.</P>
<P>I live to my own heart; and I know (I think I do) that it is not a bad one: But as I cannot intend any|thing with regard to my Emily, I mu&s;t, for her &s;ake, be more ob&s;ervant of the world's opinion, than I hope I need to be for my own. You have taught me, that it is not good manners to de&s;pi&s;e the world's opinion, tho' we &s;hould regard it only in the &s;econd place.</P>
<P>Emily has too large a fortune. I have an high opi|nion of her di&s;cretion. But &s;he is but a girl. Wo|mens eyes are wanderers: And too often bring home gue&s;ts that are very trouble&s;ome to them, and whom once introduced, they cannot get out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h &s;he had only ten thou&s;and pounds. She would then &s;tand a better chance for happine&s;s, than &s;he can do, I doubt, with five times ten; and would have five per&s;ons, to one that &s;he has now, to choo&s;e out of: For how few are there who can make pro|po&s;als to the father or guardian of a girl who has 50, 000 <HI>l.?</HI></P>
<P>Indeed there are not wanting in our &s;ex forward &s;pirits, who will think that &s;um not too much for their merits, tho' they may not de&s;erve 5000 <HI>l.</HI> nor even one. And hence ari&s;es the danger of a woman of great fortune from tho&s;e who will not dare to make propo&s;als to a guardian. After an introduction (and how ea&s;y is that now made, at public places!) a wo|man of the greate&s;t fortune is <HI>but</HI> a woman, and is to be attacked, and prevailed upon, by the &s;ame me|thods

which &s;ucceed with a per&s;on of the &s;lendere&s;t; and perhaps is won with equal, if not with greater ea&s;e; &s;ince, if the lady has a little romance in her head, and her Lover a great deal of art and flattery, &s;he will call that romantic turn genero&s;ity, and, think|ing &s;he can lay the man who has obtained her atten|tion, under obligation, &s;he will meet him her full half|way.</P>
<P>Emily is de&s;irous to be con&s;tantly with us. My &s;i&s;ter is very obliging. I know &s;he will comply with whatever I &s;hall reque&s;t of her, in relation to Emily. But where the reputation of a lady is concerned, a man &s;hould not depend too much upon his own cha|racter, e&s;pecially a young man, be it ever &s;o unexcep|tionable. Her mother has already given out fooli&s;h hints. She demands her daughter. The unhappy woman has no regard to truth. Her own character lo&s;t, and &s;o de&s;ervedly, will &s;he have any tenderne&s;s for that of Emily? Who will &s;cruple to believe, what a mother, tho' ever &s;o wicked, will report of her daughter under twenty, and her guardian under thirty, if they live con&s;tantly together? Her guardian, at the &s;ame time, carrying his heart in his countenance, and loving the girl; though with as much innocence as if &s;he were his &s;i&s;ter. Once I had thoughts of craving the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Court of Chancery for the protection of her per&s;on and fortune: But an hint of this nature di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her for many days, unknown to me. Had I been acquainted that &s;he took it &s;o hea|vily, I would not have made her unhappy for one day.</P>
<P>I have looked out among the quality for a future hu&s;band for her: But, where can I find one with whom I think &s;he will be happy? There are many who would be glad of her fortune. As I &s;aid, her fortune is too large. It is enough to render every man's ad|dre&s;s to her &s;u&s;pected; and to make a guardian ap|prehen&s;ive, that her per&s;on, agreeable as it is, and every day improving, and her mind opening to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">|vantage

every hour of her life, would be <HI>but</HI> the &s;e|cond, <HI>if</HI> the &s;econd, view of a man profe&s;&s;ing to love her. And were &s;he to marry, what a damp would the &s;lights of an hu&s;band give to the genius of a young lady, who&s;e native mode&s;ty would always make her want encouragement!</P>
<P>I have al&s;o ca&s;t an eye over the gentry within my knowledge: But have not met with one whom I could wi&s;h to be the hu&s;band of my Emily. So tender, &s;o gentle, &s;o ductile, as &s;he is, a fierce, a ra&s;h, an in|delicate, even a carele&s;s or indifferent man, would either harden her heart, or &s;horten her life: And as the latter would be much more ea&s;y to be effected than the former, what mu&s;t &s;he &s;uffer before &s;he could re|turn indifference for di&s;re&s;pect; and reach the quiet end of it!</P>
<P>See what a man Sir Walter Warkyns is! My &s;i&s;ter only could deal with &s;uch an one. A &s;uperiority in her &s;o vi&s;ible, he mu&s;t fear her: Yet a genero&s;ity &s;o great, and a dignity &s;o con&s;picuous, in her whole be|haviour, as well as countenance, he mu&s;t love her: Every-body's re&s;pect to her, would oblige love and reverence from him. But my weak-hearted, diffident Emily, what would &s;he do with &s;uch a man?</P>
<P>What would &s;he do with a Sir Hargrave Pollexfen? What with &s;uch a man, as Mr. Greville, as Sir Har|grave de&s;cribes him? I mention the&s;e men; for are not there many &s;uch?</P>
<P>I am not apt to run into grave declamations again&s;t the times: And yet, by what I have &s;een abroad, and now lately &s;ince my arrival, at home, and have heard from men of greater ob&s;ervation, and who have lived longer in the world, than I have, I cannot but think, that Engli&s;hmen are not what they were. A wretched effeminacy &s;eems to prevail among them. Marriage it&s;elf is every day more and more out of fa&s;hion; and even virtuous women give not the in&s;titution &s;o much of their countenance, as to di&s;courage by their con|tempt
<PB N="15" REF="16">
the free-livers. A good woman, as <HI>&s;uch,</HI> has therefore but few chances for happine&s;s in marriage. Yet &s;hall I not endeavour, the <HI>more</HI> endeavour, to &s;ave and &s;erve my Emily?</P>
<P>I have one encouragement, &s;ince my happy ac|quaintance with Mi&s;s Byron, to think that the age is not entirely lo&s;t to a &s;en&s;e of virtue and goodne&s;s. See we not how every-body reveres her? Even a Sir Har|grave Pollexfen, a Greville, a Fenwick, men of free lives, adore her. And at the &s;ame time &s;he meets with the love of all good men, and the re&s;pect of women, whether gay or &s;erious. But I am afraid, that the fir&s;t attraction with men, is her beauty. I am afraid, that few &s;ee in that admirable young lady what I &s;ee in her: A mind great and noble: A &s;in|cerity beyond that of women: A goodne&s;s unaffected, and which &s;hews it&s;elf in action, and not merely in words, and outward appearance: A wit lively and ino&s;&s;en&s;ive: And an under&s;tanding &s;olid and u&s;eful: All which render her a fit companion, either in the &s;ocial or contemplative hour: And yet &s;he thinks her&s;elf not above the knowlege of tho&s;e duties, the performance of which makes an e&s;&s;ential of the fe|male character.</P>
<P>But I am not giving a character of Mi&s;s Byron to you, my good Dr. Bartlett, who admire her as much as I do.</P>
<P>Do you think it impo&s;&s;ible for me to procure for my Emily &s;uch a guardian and companion as Mi&s;s By|ron, on her return to Northampton&s;hire, would make her?&mdash;Such worthy relations as &s;he would introduce her to, would be a further happine&s;s to my ward.</P>
<P>I am far from undervaluing my &s;i&s;ter's good qualities: But if Emily lives with her, &s;he mu&s;t live al&s;o with me. Indeed the affairs in which I am engaged for other people (if I may call tho&s;e who have a claim upon me for every in&s;tance of my friend|&s;hip, <HI>other</HI> people) will occa&s;ion me to be often ab&s;ent.
<PB N="16" REF="17">
But &s;till, while Grandi&s;on-hall, and St. James's Square, are the vi&s;ible places of re&s;idence equally of the guardian and ward, Emily's mother will tell the world, that we live together.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois does not choo&s;e to return to Mrs. Lane; and indeed I don't think, &s;he would be &s;afe there in a family of women, tho' very worthy ones, from the attempts of one of the &s;ex, who, having brought her into the world, calls her&s;elf her mother; and e&s;pecially now that the unhappy woman has be|gun to be trouble&s;ome there. I beg of you, there|fore, my dear Dr. Bartlett, who know more of my heart and &s;ituation than any one living (my dear Beauchamp excepted) to con&s;ider what I have writ|ten, and give me your opinion of that part of it, which relates to Mi&s;s Byron and Emily.</P>
<P>I was in&s;en&s;ibly drawing my&s;elf in to enumerate the engagements, which at pre&s;ent pre&s;s mo&s;t upon me. Let me add to the &s;ubject&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;oon go to Paris, in order finally to &s;ettle &s;uch of the affairs of my late worthy friend, as cannot be &s;o well done by any other hand. The three thou&s;and pounds, which he has directed to be di&s;po&s;ed of to charitable u&s;es, in France as well as in England, at the di&s;cretion of his executor, is one of them.</P>
<P>Perhaps equity will allow me to add to this limited &s;um from what will remain in my hands after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the nephews and niece. As they are young, and brought up with a hope that they will make a figure in the world by their diligence, I would not, by any means, make them independent on that. The whole e&s;tate, divided among them, would not be &s;ufficient to an&s;wer that purpo&s;e happily, tho' it might be enough to abate the edge of their indu&s;try.</P>
<P>The charity that I am mo&s;t intent upon promoting in France, and in England too, is, that of giving lit|tle fortunes to young maidens in marriage with hone&s;t men of their own degree, who might, from &s;uch an
<PB N="17" REF="18">
out&s;etting, begin the world, as it is called, with &s;ome hope of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>By this time, my dear Dr. Bartlett, you will gue&s;s that I have a de&s;ign upon you. It is, that you will a&s;&s;i&s;t me in executing the Will of my late friend. Make enquiries after, and reccommend to me, objects worthy of relief. You was very de&s;irous, &s;ome time ago, to retire to the Hall: But I knew not how to &s;pare you; and I hoped to attend you thither. You &s;hall now &s;et out for that place as &s;oon as you plea&s;e. And that neither may be (or as little as po&s;&s;ible) lo&s;ers by the &s;eparation, every-thing that we would &s;ay to each other, were we together, <HI>that,</HI> as we u&s;ed to do, we will &s;ay by pen and ink. We will be joint exe|cutors, in the fir&s;t place, for this &s;um of 3000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Make enquiries then, as &s;oon as you get down, for worthy objects&mdash;The indu&s;trious poor, of <HI>all</HI> per|&s;ua&s;ions, reduced either by age, infirmity, or acci|dent; Tho&s;e who labour under incurable maladies; Youth, of either &s;ex, capable of beginning the world to advantage, but de&s;titute of the means; The&s;e, in particular, are the objects we both think worthy of a&s;&s;i&s;tance. You &s;hall take 500 <HI>l.</HI> down with you, for a beginning.</P>
<P>It is my pride, it is my glory, that I can &s;ay, Dr. Bartlett and Charles Grandi&s;on, on all benevolent occa&s;ions, are actuated by one &s;oul. My dear friend, adieu.</P>

<P>I HAVE furni&s;hed the Ladies, and my Lord, with more letters. And &s;o they have all my heart be|fore them!&mdash;I don't care. The man is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; and they railly me not &s;o much as before,
<PB N="18" REF="19">
while they thought I affected re&s;erves to them. Indeed it would be cruel, if they did; and I &s;hould have run away from them.</P>
<P>I am glad you all think, that the two &s;i&s;ters u&s;ed me &s;everely. They really did. But I have this gra|tification of my pride in reflecting upon their treat|ment of me&mdash;I would not have done &s;o by them, had &s;ituations been exchanged. And I think my&s;elf nearer an equality with them, than I had thought my&s;elf before.&mdash;But they are good ladies, and my &s;incere friends and well-wi&s;hers; and I forgive them: And &s;o mu&s;t my dear grandmamma.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">thinks, that her delicacy has been offended on the occa&s;ion. And <HI>did</HI> &s;he weep at the hearing read my account of that attack made upon her girl by the over-lively Charlotte?&mdash;O the dear, the in|dulgent, parent! How tender was it of my aunt too, to be concerned for the poor Harriet's delicacy, &s;o hard put to it as &s;he was! It did indeed (as &s;he di|&s;tingui&s;hes in her u&s;ual charming manner) look, as if they put a great price upon their intended friend&s;hip to me, with regard to my intere&s;t in their brother's heart: As if the favour done to the humbled girl, if they could jointly procure for her their brother's countenance, might well allow of their <HI>raillery.</HI> &mdash;Don't, pray don't, my dear grandmamma, call it by a &s;everer name. They did not, I am <HI>&s;ure</HI> they did not, mean to hurt me &s;o much, as I really was hurt. So let it pa&s;s. Humour and raillery are very difficult things to rein in. They are ever curveting like a prancing hor&s;e; and they will often throw the rider who depends more upon his &s;kill in managing them, than he has rea&s;on to do.</P>
<P>My uncle was charmed with the &s;cene; and thinks the two ladies did ju&s;t as <HI>he</HI> would have done. He means it a compliment to their <HI>delicacy,</HI> I pre&s;ume. But I am of my aunt Selby's opinion, that their <HI>gene|rous</HI> 
<PB N="19" REF="20">
brother would not have given them thanks for their raillery to the poor frighted Harriet. I am very happy, however, that my behaviour and frankne&s;s on the occa&s;ion are not di&s;approved at Selby-hou&s;e, and Shirley-manor, and by you, my Lucy. And here let that matter re&s;t.</P>
<P>Should I not begin to think of going back to you all, my Lucy? I believe I blu&s;h ten times a day, when alone, to find my&s;elf waiting and waiting as if for the gracious motion; yet apprehending that it never <HI>will,</HI> never <HI>can,</HI> be made; and all you, my friends, indulging an ab&s;ence, that your goodne&s;s makes painful to you, in the &s;ame hope. It looks&mdash;Don't it, Lucy?&mdash;&s;o like a de&s;ign upon&mdash;I don't know how it looks!&mdash;But at times, I can't endure my&s;elf. And yet while the love of virtue (a little too per&s;onal, perhaps) is the foundation of the&s;e de&s;igns, the&s;e waitings, the&s;e emotions, I think, I am not wholly inexcu&s;able.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I &s;hould not e&s;teem him, were he not the good man he is.&mdash;Pray, let me a&s;k you&mdash;Do you think he could not be put upon &s;aying &s;omething af|fronting to me; upon doing &s;omething unworthy of his character?&mdash;O then I am &s;ure I &s;hould hate him: All the other in&s;tances of his goodne&s;s would then be as nothing. I will be captious, I think: and &s;tudy to be affronted, whether he intends to affront me, or not.&mdash;But what a multitude of fooli&s;h notions comes into the head of a &s;illy girl, who, little as &s;he knows, knows more of any-thing, or of any-body, than &s;he knows of her&s;elf!</P>
<P>I WISH my godfather had not put it in my head, that Emily is cheri&s;hing (perhaps unknown to her&s;elf) a flame that will devour her peace. For to be &s;ure this young creature can have no hope that&mdash;Yet 50,000<HI>l.</HI> is a va&s;t fortune. But it can never buy her

guardian. Do you think &s;uch a man as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on has a price?&mdash;I am &s;ure he has not.</P>
<P>I watch the countenance, the words, the air of the girl, when he is &s;poken of. And with pity I &s;ee, that he cannot be named, but her eyes &s;parkle. Her eye is taken off her work or book, as &s;he happens to be engaged in either, and &s;he &s;eems as if &s;he would look the per&s;on through who is prai&s;ing her guardian. For the life of her, &s;he cannot <HI>work</HI> and <HI>hear.</HI> And then &s;he &s;ighs&mdash;Upon my word, Lucy, there is no &s;uch thing as proceeding with his prai&s;es before her&mdash;the girl &s;o &s;ighs&mdash;So young a creature!&mdash;Yet how can one caution the poor thing?</P>
<P>But what makes me a little more ob&s;ervant of her, than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e perhaps have been (additional to my godfather's ob&s;ervation) is an hint given me by Lady L. which perhaps &s;he has from Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, and <HI>&s;he</HI> not unlikely from the &s;tolen letter: For Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on hinted at it, but I thought it was only to excite my curio&s;ity [When one is not in good humour, how one's very &s;tile is encumbred!]: The hint is this, That it is more than probable, it will be actually propo&s;ed to me, to take down with me to Northampton&s;hire this young lady&mdash;I, who want a governe&s;s my&s;elf, to be&mdash;But <HI>let</HI> it be propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>In a conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed ju&s;t now, between us women, on the &s;ubject of Love (a favourite topic with all girls), <HI>this</HI> poor thing gave her opinion una&s;ked; and, for a young girl, was quite alert, I thought. She u&s;ed to be more attentive than talkative.</P>
<P>I whi&s;pered Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on once, Don't you think Mi&s;s Jervois talks more than &s;he u&s;ed to do, madam?</P>
<P>I think &s;he does, <HI>madam,</HI> re-whi&s;pered the arch lady.</P>
<P>I beg your pardon&mdash;<HI>Charlotte,</HI> then.</P>
<P>You have it, <HI>Harriet,</HI> then.&mdash;But let her prate. She is not often in the humour.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
Nay, with all my heart; I love Mi&s;s Jervois: But I can't but watch when habits begin to change. And I am always afraid of young creatures expo&s;ing them|&s;elves when they are between girls and women.</P>
<P>I don't love whi&s;pering, &s;aid Mi&s;s Jervois, more pertly than ever: But my guardian loves me; and you, ladies, love me; and &s;o my heart is ea&s;y.</P>

<P>O BUT, Lucy, we are alarmed here on Mi&s;s Jer|vois's account, by a letter which Dr. Bartlett received a little late la&s;t night from Sir Charles; &s;o &s;hewed it us not till this morning as we were at breakfa&s;t.

<P>I HAVE had a vi&s;it, my dear and reverend friend, from Emily's mother. She will very probably make one al&s;o at Colnebrooke, before I can be &s;o happy as to get thither. I di&s;patch this therefore, to appri&s;e you and Lord L. of &s;uch a probability; which is the greater, as &s;he knows Emily to be there, thro' the inadvertence of Saunders, and finds <HI>me</HI> to be in town. I will give you the particulars of what pa&s;&s;ed between us, for your better information, if &s;he goes to Colnebrooke.</P>
<P>I was preparing to attend Lord W. as by appoint|ment, when &s;he &s;ent in her name to me.</P>
<P>I received her civilly. She had the a&s;&s;urance to make up to me with a full expectation that I would &s;alute her; but I took, or rather <HI>received,</HI> her ready hand, and led her to a chair by the fire-&s;ide. You have never &s;een her. She thinks her&s;elf &s;till hand|&s;ome; and, did not her vices make her odious, and her <HI>whole a&s;pect</HI> &s;hew her heart, &s;he would not be much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>How does Emily, Sir? gallanting her fan: Is the girl here? Bid her come to me. I <HI>will</HI> &s;ee her.</P>
<P>She is not here, madam.</P>
<P>Where is &s;he then? She has not been at Mrs. Lane's for &s;ome time.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="24">
She is in the be&s;t protection: She is with my two &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>And pray, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, What do you intend to do with her? The girl begins to be wo|manly.</P>
<P>She laughed; and her heart &s;poke out at her eyes.</P>
<P>Tell me what you propo&s;e to do with her? You know, added &s;he, affecting a &s;erious air, that &s;he is my child.</P>
<P>If, madam, you de&s;erve to be thought her mother, you will be &s;atisfied with the hands &s;he is in.</P>
<P>Pi&s;h!&mdash;I never loved you good men: Where a fine girl comes in their way, I know what I know&mdash;</P>
<P>She looked wantonly, and laughed again.</P>
<P>I am not to talk &s;eriou&s;ly with you, Mrs. Jervois: But what have you to <HI>&s;ay</HI> to my ward?</P>
<P><HI>Say!</HI> &mdash;Why, you know, Sir, I am her mother: And I have a mind to have the care of her per&s;on my|&s;elf. You mu&s;t (&s;o her father directed) have the care of her fortune. But I have a mind, for her reputation|&s;ake, to take the girl out of the hands of &s;o young a guardian. I hope you will not oppo&s;e me.</P>
<P>If this be all your bu&s;ine&s;s, madam, I mu&s;t be ex|cu&s;ed. I am preparing, as you &s;ee, to dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Where is Emily? I <HI>will</HI> &s;ee the girl.</P>
<P>If your motive be motherly love, little, madam, as you have acted the mother by her, you &s;hall &s;ee her when &s;he is in town. But her <HI>per&s;on,</HI> and <HI>repu|tation,</HI> as well as <HI>fortune,</HI> mu&s;t be my care.</P>
<P>I am married, Sir: And my hu&s;band is a man of honour.</P>
<P>Your marriage, madam, gives a new rea&s;on why Emily mu&s;t not be in your care.</P>
<P>Let me tell you, Sir, that my hu&s;band is a man of honour, and as brave a man as your&s;elf; and he will &s;ee me righted.</P>
<P>Be he who he will, he can have no bu&s;ine&s;s with Emily. Did you come to tell me you are married, mama?</P>

I did, Sir, Don't you wi&s;h me joy?&mdash;</P>
<P>Joy, madam! I wi&s;h you to de&s;erve joy, and you will then perhaps have it. You'll excu&s;e me&mdash;I &s;hall make my friends wait.</P>
<P>I could not re&s;train my indignation. This woman marries, as &s;he calls it, twice or thrice a year.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, then you will find time, perhaps, to talk with Major O Hara. He is of one of the be&s;t families in Ireland. And he will not let me be robbed of my daughter.</P>
<P>Major O-Hara, madam, has nothing to do with the daughter of my late unhappy friend. Nor have I any-thing to &s;ay to <HI>him.</HI> Emily is in my protection; and I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that &s;he never had been &s;o, were not the woman who calls her&s;elf her mother, the per&s;on lea&s;t fit to be intru&s;ted with her daughter. Permit me the favour of leading you to your chair.</P>
<P>She then broke out into the language in which &s;he always concludes the&s;e vi&s;its. She threatened me with the re&s;entments of Major O-Hara; and told me, He had been a conqueror in half a dozen duels.</P>
<P>I offered my hand. She refu&s;ed it not. I led her to her chair.</P>
<P>I will call again to-morrow afternoon, &s;aid &s;he (threatning with her head), perhaps with the major, Sir. And I expect you will produce the little har|lotry&mdash;</P>
<P>I withdrew in &s;ilent contempt. Vile woman!</P>
<P>But let nothing of this e&s;cape you to my Emily. I think &s;he &s;hould not &s;ee her but in my pre&s;ence. The poor girl will be terrified into fits, as &s;he was the la&s;t time &s;he &s;aw her, if &s;he comes, and I am not there. But po&s;&s;ibly I may hear no more of this wicked woman for a month or two. Having a power to make her annuity either one or two hundred pounds, according to her behaviour, at my own di&s;cretion, the man &s;he has married, who could have no inducement, but the annuity, if he <HI>has</HI> married her, will not &s;uffer her to
<PB N="25" REF="26">
incur &s;uch a reduction of it; for, you know, I have always hitherto paid her two hundred pounds a year. Her threatening to &s;ee me to-morrow may be to amu&s;s me while &s;he goes. The woman is a fooli&s;h woman; but, being accu&s;tomed to intrigue, &s;he aims at cun|ning and contrivance.</P>
<P>I am now ha&s;tening to Lord W. I hope his woman will not be admitted to his table, as the generally is, let who will be pre&s;ent; yet, it &s;eems, knows not how to be &s;ilent, whatever be the &s;ubject. I have never cho&s;en either to dine or &s;up with my Lord, that I might not be under a nece&s;&s;ity of objecting to her company: And were I <HI>not</HI> to object to it, as I am a near kin&s;man to my Lord, and know the &s;ituation &s;he is in with him, my complai&s;ance might be imputed to motives altogether unworthy of a man of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Yours of this morning was brought me, ju&s;t as I was concluding. There is one paragraph in it, that greatly intere&s;ts me.</P>
<P>You hint to me, that my &s;i&s;ters, tho' my ab&s;ences are &s;hort, would be glad to receive now-and-then a letter from me. You, my dear friend, have engaged me into a kind of habit, which makes me write to you with ea&s;e and plea&s;ure.&mdash;To you, and to our Beau|champ, methinks, I can write any-thing. U&s;e, it is true, would make it equally agreeable to me to write to my &s;i&s;ters. I would not have them think that there is a brother in the world, that better loves his &s;i&s;ters than I do mine: And now, you know, I have three. But why have they not &s;ignified as much to me? Could I give plea&s;ure to any whom I love, without giving great pain to my&s;elf, it would be unpardonable not to do it.</P>
<P>I could ea&s;ily carry on a corre&s;pondence with my &s;i&s;ters, were they to be very earne&s;t about it: But then it mu&s;t be a <HI>corre&s;pondence:</HI> The writing mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t not be all of one &s;ide. Do they think I &s;hould not be equally plea&s;ed to hear what <HI>they</HI> are about, from time
<PB N="26" REF="27">
to time; and what, occa&s;ionally, their &s;entiments are, upon per&s;ons and things? If it fall in your way, and you think it not a mere temporary wi&s;h (for young Ladies often wi&s;h, and think no more of the matter); then propo&s;e the condition.&mdash;But caution them, that the moment I di&s;cover, that they are le&s;s frank, and more re&s;erved, than I am, there will be an end of the corre&s;pondence. My <HI>three</HI> &s;i&s;ters are mo&s;t amiably frank, for women&mdash;But, thus challenged, dare they enter the li&s;ts, upon honour, with a man, a <HI>brother,</HI> upon equal terms?&mdash;O no! They dare not. It is not in woman to be unre&s;erved in &s;ome points; and (to be impartial) perhaps they &s;hould not: Yet, &s;urely, there is now-and-then a man, a brother, to be met with, who would be the more grateful for the confidence repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>Were this propo&s;al to be accepted, I could write to them many of the things that I communicate to you. I have but few &s;ecrets. I only wi&s;h to keep from relations &s;o dear to me, things that could not po&s;&s;ibly yield them plea&s;ure. I am &s;ure I could tru&s;t to your judgment, the pa&s;&s;ages that might be read to them from my letters to you.</P>
<P>Sometimes, indeed, I love to divert my&s;elf with Charlotte's humorous curio&s;ity; for &s;he &s;eems, as I told her lately, to love to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ecrets, where there are none, for a compliment to her own &s;agacity, when &s;he thinks &s;he has found them out; and I love at &s;uch times to &s;ee her puzzled, and at a fault, as a puni&s;hment for her declining to &s;peak out.</P>
<P>You have told me heretofore, in excu&s;e for the di|&s;tance, which my <HI>two elder &s;i&s;ters</HI> ob&s;erve to their brother, when I have complained of it to you, that it proceeded from awe, from reverence for him. But why &s;hould there be that awe, that reverence? Surely, my dear friend, if this is &s;pontaneous, and invincible, in them, there mu&s;t be &s;ome fault in my behaviour, &s;ome &s;eeming want of freedom in my
<PB N="27" REF="28">
manner, with which you will not acquaint me: It is otherwi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible, that between brothers and &s;i&s;ters, where the love is not doubted on either &s;ide, &s;uch a di&s;tance &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t. You mu&s;t con&s;ult them upon it, and get them to explain them&s;elves on this &s;ubject to you; and when they have done &s;o, tell me of my fault, and I will endeavour to render my&s;elf more agree|able (more familiar, &s;hall I &s;ay?) to them. But I will not by any means excu&s;e them, if they give me cau&s;e to think, that the di&s;tance is owing to the will and the power I have been ble&s;&s;ed with to do my <HI>duty</HI> by them. What would this be, but indirectly to declare, that once they expected not ju&s;tice from their brother? But no more of this &s;ubject at pre&s;ent. I am im|patient to be with you all at Colnebrooke; you can|not think how impatient. Self-denial is a very hard doctrine to be learned, my good Dr. Bartlett.

<P>POOR Emily! her heart is almo&s;t broken. This ignoble pa&s;&s;ion, what a mean-&s;pirited creature had it like to have made me!&mdash;Be quiet, be quiet, Lucy!&mdash;I <HI>will</HI> call it <HI>ignoble.</HI> Did you ever know me before &s;o little?&mdash;And had it not like to have put me upon being hard-hearted, envious, and I can't tell what, to a poor fatherle&s;s girl, ju&s;t &s;tarting into woman, and therefore into more danger than &s;he ever was in before; wanting to be protected&mdash;from whom? From a <HI>mother.</HI> &mdash;Dreadful circum&s;tance!&mdash;Yet I am ready to grudge the poor girl her guardian, and her innocent prattle!&mdash;But let me be de&s;pi&s;ed by the man I love, if I do not conquer this new-di&s;covered envy,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
jealou&s;y, littlene&s;s, at lea&s;t with regard to this un|happy girl, who&s;e calamity endears her to me.</P>
<P>Dear child! &s;weet Emily! You <HI>&s;hall</HI> go down with me, if it be propo&s;ed. My grandmamma, and uncle, and aunt, will permit me to carry you with me. They are generous: They have no little pa&s;&s;ion to mi&s;lead their beneficence: They are what I hope to be, now I have found my&s;elf out&mdash;And what if her gratitude &s;hall make her heart overflow into Love, has &s;he not excu&s;e for it, if Harriet has any?</P>
<P>Well, but to the occa&s;ion of the poor Emily's di|&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;About twelve this day, &s;oon after Lord L. and the two &s;i&s;ters and I, came from church (for Emily happened not to go), a coach and four &s;topped at the gate, and a &s;ervant in a &s;orry livery, alighting from behind it, enquired for Lord L. Two gentlemen, who by their dre&s;s and appearance were military men, and one Lady, were in it.</P>
<P>My Lord ordered them to be invited to alight, and received them with his u&s;ual politene&s;s.</P>
<P>Don't let me call this unhappy woman Emily's mother; O Hara is the name &s;he owns.</P>
<P>She addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to my Lord: I am the mother of Emily Jervois, my Lord: This gentleman, Major O Hara is my husband.</P>
<P>The Major bowed, &s;trutted, and acknowleged her for his wife: And this gentleman, my Lord, &s;aid he, is Captain Salmeret; a very brave man: He is in fo|reign &s;ervice. His Lady is my own &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>My Lord took notice of each.</P>
<P>I under&s;tand, my Lord, that my daughter is here. I de&s;ire to &s;ee her.</P>
<P>One of my Lord's &s;ervants, at that time, pa&s;&s;ing by the door, which was open, Pray Sir, &s;aid &s;he to him, let Mi&s;s Jervois know, that her mamma is come to &s;ee her. De&s;ire her to come to me.</P>
<P><HI>Major.</HI> I long to &s;ee my new daughter: I hear &s;he is a charming young Lady. She may depend upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nd e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">s of a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">her from me.</P>

<P><HI>Capt.</HI> De man of honour and good nature be my broder's general cha-<HI>ract</HI> -er, I do a&s;&s;ure your Lord|&s;hip.</P>
<P>He &s;poke Engli&s;h as a Frenchman, my Lord &s;ays; but pronounced the word character as an Iri&s;hman.</P>
<P><HI>Major</HI> (bowing). No need of this, my dear friend. My Lord has the cha-<HI>ract</HI> -er of a fine gentleman him&s;elf, and knows how to receive a gentleman who waits upon him with due re&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> I hope I do. But, madam, you know who&s;e protection the Lady is in.</P>
<P><HI>Mrs. O-Hara.</HI> I do, my Lord. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is a very fine gentleman.</P>
<P><HI>Capt.</HI> De vine&s;t cha-<HI>ract</HI> -er in de vorld. By my &s;alvation, every-body &s;ay &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Mrs. O-Hara.</HI> But Sir Charles, my Lord, is a very young gentleman to be guardian to &s;o young a creature; e&s;pecially now that &s;he is growing into woman. I have had &s;ome few faults, I own. Who lives, that has not? But I have been ba&s;ely &s;canda|lized. My fir&s;t hu&s;band had <HI>his;</HI> and much greater than I had. He was &s;et again&s;t me by &s;ome of his own relations: Vile creatures!&mdash;He left me, and went abroad; but he has an&s;wered for all by this time; and for the &s;canty allowance he made me, his great fortune con&s;idered: But as long as my child will be the better for it, that I can forgive.&mdash;Emily, my dear!&mdash;</P>
<P>She &s;tepped to the door on hearing the ru&s;tling of &s;ilks, &s;uppo&s;ing her at hand; but it was Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on, followed by a &s;ervant with chocolate, to afford her pretence to &s;ee the vi&s;itors; and at the &s;ame time having a mind to hint to them, that they were not to expect to be a&s;ked to &s;tay to dinner.</P>
<P>It is to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on that I owe the de&s;cription of each, the account of what pa&s;&s;ed, and the broken dialect.</P>
<P>Mrs. O-Hara has been an hand&s;ome woman; but
<PB N="30" REF="31">
well might Sir Charles be di&s;gu&s;ted with her a&s;pect. She has a leering, fly, yet confident eye; and a very bold countenance. She is not ungenteel; yet her very dre&s;s denotes her turn of mind. Her com|plexion, &s;allowi&s;h, &s;treaked with red, makes her face (which is not &s;o plump as it once has been) look like a withering John-apple that never ripened kindly</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on has a way of &s;aying ill-natured things in &s;uch a good-natured manner, that one can|not forbear &s;miling, tho' one &s;hould not altogether approve of them; and yet &s;ometimes one would be ready to wonder how &s;he came by her images.</P>
<P>The Major is pert, bold, vain, and &s;eemed parti|cularly &s;ond of his new &s;carlet coat and laced wai&s;t|coat. He is certainly, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;ays, a low man, tho' a &s;oldier. Ander&s;on, added &s;he, is worth fifty of him. His face, fiery and highly pimpled, is &s;et off to advantage by an enormous &s;olitaire. His bad and &s;traggling teeth are &s;hewn continually by an af|fected laugh, and his empty di&s;cour&s;e is interlarded with eaths; which, with my uncle's leave, I &s;hall omit.</P>
<P>Captain Salmonet, &s;he &s;ays, appeared to her in a middle way between a beau and a Dutch boor; aiming at gentility, with a per&s;on and &s;hape uncom|monly clum&s;y.</P>
<P>They both a&s;&s;umed military airs, which not &s;itting naturally, gave them what Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on called, The &s;wagger of &s;oldierly importance.</P>
<P>Emily was in her own apartment, almo&s;t fainting with terror: For the &s;ervant, to whom Mrs. O-Hara had &s;poken, to bid her daughter come to her, had offi|ciou&s;ly carried up the me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>To what Mrs. O-Hara had &s;aid in defence of her own character, my Lord an&s;wered, Mr. Jervois had, a right, madam, to do what he plea&s;ed with a fortune acquired by his own indu&s;try. A di&s;agreement in marriage is very unhappy; but in this ca&s;e, as in a duel, the &s;urvivor is hardly ever in fault. I have
<PB N="31" REF="32">
nothing to do in this matter. Mi&s;s Jervois is very happy in Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's protection. She thinks &s;o; and &s;o does every-body that knows her. It is your misfortune if <HI>you</HI> do not.</P>
<P><HI>Mrs. O Hara.</HI> My Lord, I make no di&s;pute of Sir Charles's being the guardian of her fortune; but no father can give away the authority a mother has, as well as him&s;elf, over her child.</P>
<P><HI>Major.</HI> That child a daughter too, my Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> To all this I have nothing to &s;ay. You will not be able, I believe, to per&s;uade my brother Grandi&s;on to give up his ward's per&s;on to you, madam.</P>
<P><HI>Mrs. O-Hara.</HI> Chancery may, my Lord&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> I have nothing to &s;ay to this, madam. No man in England knows better what is to be done, in this ca&s;e, than Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; and no man will be readier to do what is ju&s;t and fitting, without law: But I enter not into the ca&s;e; you mu&s;t not talk to me on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Do you think, madam, that your mar|riage intitles you the <HI>rather</HI> to have the care of Mi&s;s Jervois?</P>
<P><HI>Major</HI> (with great quickne&s;s). I hope, madam, that my honour and my cha-<HI>ract</HI> -er&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Be they ever &s;o unque&s;tionable, will not intitle you, Sir, to the guardian&s;hip of Mi&s;s Jervois's per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Major.</HI> I do not pretend to it, madam. But I hope that no father's will, no guardian's power, is to &s;et a&s;ide the natural authority which a mother has over her child.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> This is not my affair. I am not <HI>inclined</HI> to enter into a di&s;pute with you, madam, on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Mrs. O-Hara.</HI> Let Emily be called down to her mother. I hope I may &s;ee my child. She is in this hou&s;e, my Lord. I hope, I may &s;ee my child.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="33">
<P><HI>Major.</HI> Your Lord&s;hip, and you, madam, will allow, that it would be the greate&s;t hard&s;hip in the world, to deny to a mother the &s;ight of her child.</P>

<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Her guardian perhaps will not deny it. You mu&s;t apply to him. He is in town. Mi&s;s Jer|vois is here but as a gue&s;t. She will be &s;oon in town. I mu&s;t not have her alarmed. She has very weak &s;pirits.</P>
<P><HI>Mrs. O-Hara.</HI> Weak &s;pirits, my Lord!&mdash;A child to have &s;pirits too weak to &s;ee her mother!&mdash;And &s;he felt for her handkerchief.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> It &s;ounds a little har&s;hly, I own, to deny to a mother the &s;ight of her daughter: But unle&s;s my brother were pre&s;ent, I think, my Lord, it cannot be allowed.</P>
<P><HI>Major.</HI> Not allowed, madam!</P>
<P><HI>Capt.</HI> A moder to be denied to &s;ee her daughter! Je&s;u! And he cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf.</P>

<P><HI>Capt.</HI> Upon my &s;alvation this mu&s;t not pa&s;s&mdash;And he &s;waggered about the room.</P>
<P>Mrs. O-Hara looked with an air of incredulity.</P>
<P>It was true, however: For the poor girl being ready to &s;aint, I was called in to her. Lady L. had been making a vi&s;it in the chariot; and it had ju&s;t brought her back. O &s;ave me, &s;ave me, dear madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s Emily, to me, wringing her hands. I can|not, I cannot &s;ee my mother out of my guardian's, pre&s;ence: And the will make me own her new hu&s;|band. I be&s;eech you, &s;ave me; hide me!</P>
<P>I &s;aw the chariot from the window, and, without a&s;king any que&s;tions, I hurried Mi&s;s Emily down &s;tairs, and conducted the trembling dear into it; and whipping in after her, ordered the coachman to drive any-where, except towards London: And then the poor girl threw her arms about my neck, &s;mothering me with her ki&s;&s;es, and calling me by all the tender names that terror and mingled gratitude could &s;ug|ge&s;t to her.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on told the circum&s;tances pretty near as above; adding, I think, my Lord, that Mi&s;s Emily wants not apology for her terror on this occa&s;ion. That Lady, in her own heart, knows that the poor girl has rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid the Major, my wife is cruelly u&s;ed. Your brother&mdash;But I &s;hall talk to <HI>him</HI> upon the &s;ub|ect. He is &s;aid to be a man of con&s;cience and ho|nour: I hope I &s;hall find him &s;o. I know how to protect and right my wife.</P>

<P>And &s;he looked fierce, and particularly &s;piteful; and then declared, that &s;he would &s;tay there till Emily came back, were it midnight.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> You will have my leave for that, madam?</P>
<P><HI>Major.</HI> Had we not be&s;t go into our coach, and let that drive in que&s;t of her?&mdash;She cannot be far off. It will be ea&s;y to trace a chariot.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Since this matter is carried &s;o far, let me tell you, that, in the ab&s;ence of her guardian, I will protect her. Since Mi&s;s Jervois is thus aver&s;e, &s;he &s;hall be indulged in it. If you &s;ee her, madam, it mu&s;t be by the con&s;ent, and in the pre&s;ence, of her guardian.</P>
<P><HI>Major.</HI> Well, my dear, &s;ince the matter &s;tands thus; &s;ince your child is taught to &s;hun you thus: let us &s;ee what Sir Charles Grandi&s;on will &s;ay to it. He is the principal in this affair, and is not <HI>privileged.</HI> If <HI>he</HI> thinks fit&mdash;And there he &s;topped, and blu&s;tered; and offered his hand to his bride.&mdash;I am able both to protect and right you, madam; and I <HI>will.</HI> But you have a letter for the girl, written on a &s;uppo&s;ition that

&s;he was not here.&mdash;Little did you think, or I think, that &s;he was in the hou&s;e when we came; and that &s;he &s;hould be &s;pirited away to avoid paying her duty to her mother.</P>
<P>Very true. Very true. And, Very true, &s;aid each; and Mrs. O-Hara pulled out the letter, laying it on one of the chairs; and de&s;ired it might be given to her daughter. And then they all went away, very much di&s;&s;atisfied; the two men muttering and threat|ning, and re&s;olving, as they &s;aid, to make a vi&s;it to Sir Charles.</P>
<P>I hope we &s;hall &s;ee him here very &s;oon. I hope the&s;e wretches will not in&s;ult him, or endanger a life &s;o precious. Poor Emily! I pity her from my heart. She is as much grieved on this occa&s;ion, as I was, in dread of the re&s;entment of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen.</P>
<P>Let me give you &s;ome account of what pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Emily and me: You will be charmed with her beautiful &s;implicity.</P>
<P>When we were in the chariot, &s;he told me, that the la&s;t time &s;he &s;aw her mother, it was at Mrs. Lane's: The bad woman made a pretence of private bu&s;ine&s;s with her daughter, and withdrew with her into an|other room, and then in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould go off with her, unknown to any-body. And becau&s;e I de|&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, &s;aid &s;he, my mother laid her hands upon me, and &s;aid &s;he would trample me under her foot. It is true, (unhappy woman!) &s;he was&mdash;[Then the dear girl whi&s;pered me, tho' no-body was near us&mdash;&s;weet mode&s;t creature, loth to reveal this part of her mother's &s;hame even to me aloud, and blu&s;hed as &s;he &s;poke&mdash;] &s;he was in her cups.&mdash;My mamma is as naughty as &s;ome <HI>men</HI> in that re&s;pect: And I believe &s;he would have been as good as her word; but on my &s;creaming (for I was very much frighted) Mrs. Lane, who had an eye upon us, ran in with two &s;ervants, and one of her daughters, and re&s;cued me. She <HI>had</HI> torn my cap&mdash;Yet it was a &s;ad
<PB N="36" REF="37">
thing, you know, madam, to &s;ee one's mother put out of the hou&s;e again&s;t her will. And then &s;he rai&s;ed the neighbourhood. Lord ble&s;s me, I thought I &s;hould have d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. I <HI>did</HI> fall into fits. Then was Mrs. Lane forced to tell every one what a &s;ad woman my mother was! It was &s;uch a di&s;grace to me!&mdash;It was a month before I eould go to church, or look any-body in the face. But Mrs. Lane's character was of her &s;ide; and my guardian's goodne&s;s was a help&mdash;Shall I &s;ay a help again&s;t my mother?&mdash;Poor woman! we heard afterwards, &s;he was dead; but my guardian would not believe it. If it would plea&s;e God to take me, I &s;hould rejoice. Many a tear does my poor mother, and the trouble I give to the be&s;t of men, co&s;t me, when nobody &s;ees me; and many a time do I cry my&s;elf to &s;leep, when I think it impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould get &s;uch a kind relief.</P>
<P>I was moved at the dear girl's melancholy tale. I cla&s;ped my arms about her, and wept on her gentle bo&s;om. Her calamity, which was the greate&s;t that could happen to a good child, I told her, had en|deared her to me: I would love her as my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>And &s;o I will: Dear child, I will for ever love her. And I am ready to hate my&s;elf for &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ages in my la&s;t letter. O how deceitful is the heart! I could not have thought it po&s;&s;ible that mine could have been &s;o narrow.</P>
<P>The dear girl rejoiced in my a&s;&s;urances, and pro|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed grateful love to the late&s;t hour of her life.</P>
<P>Indeed, madam, I have a grateful heart, &s;aid &s;he, for all I am &s;o unhappy in a certain relation. I have none of tho&s;e &s;ort of faults that give me a re&s;emblance in any way to my poor mother. But how &s;hall I make out what I &s;ay? You will mi&s;tru&s;t me, I fear: You will be apt to doubt my principles. But will you promi&s;e to take my heart in your hand, and guide it as you plea&s;e?&mdash;Indeed it is an hone&s;t one. I wi&s;h you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aw it thro' and thro'.&mdash;If ever I do a wrong
<PB N="37" REF="38">
thing, mi&s;tru&s;t my head, if you plea&s;e, but not my heart. But in every-thing I will be directed by you; and then my head will be as right as my heart.</P>
<P>I told her, that good often re&s;ulted from evil. It was an happy thing perhaps for both, that her mo|ther's vi&s;it had been made. Look upon me, my dear Emily, as your entire friend: We will have but one heart between us.</P>
<P>Let me add, Lucy, that if you find me capable of drawing this &s;weet girl into con&s;e&s;&s;ions of her in&s;ant love, and of making ungenerous advantage of them, tho' the event were to be fatal to my peace if I did not; I now call upon all you, my dear friends, to de&s;pi&s;e and renounce the treacherous friend in Harriet Byron.</P>
<P>She be&s;ought me to let her write to me; to let her come to me for advice, as often as &s;he wanted it, whether here, in my dre&s;&s;ing-room or chamber, or at Mr. Reeves's, when I went from Colnebrooke.</P>
<P>I con&s;ented very chearfully, and at her reque&s;t (for indeed, &s;aid &s;he, I would not be an intruder for the world) promi&s;ed by a nod at her entrance, to let her know, if &s;he came when I was bu&s;y, that &s;he mu&s;t retire, and come another time.</P>
<P>You are too young a Lady, added &s;he, to be called my mamma&mdash;Alas! I have never a mamma, you know: But I will love you, and obey you, on the holding up of your finger, as I would my mother, were &s;he as good as you.</P>
<P>Does not the beautiful &s;implicity of this charming girl affect you, Lucy? But her eyes &s;wimming in tears, her earne&s;t looks, her throbbing bo&s;om, her hands now cla&s;ped about me, now in one another, added &s;uch graces to what &s;he &s;aid, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to it: And yet I am affected as I write; but not &s;o much, you may believe, as at the time &s;he told her tender tale.</P>
<P>Indeed her calamity has given her an ab&s;olute po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion

of my heart. I, who had &s;uch good parents, and have had my lo&s;s of them &s;o happily alleviated, and even &s;upplied, by a grandmamma and an aunt &s;o truly maternal, as well as by the love of every one to whom I have the happine&s;s to be related; how un|worthy of &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings &s;hould I be, if I did not know how to pity a poor girl who mu&s;t reckon a liv|ing mother as her heavie&s;t misfortune!</P>
<P>Sir Charles, from the time of the di&s;turbance which this unhappy woman made in Mrs. Lane's neighbour|hood, and of her violence to his Emily, not only threatned to take from her that moiety of the an|nuity which he is at liberty to withdraw; but gave orders that &s;he &s;hould never again be allowed to &s;ee his ward but in his pre&s;ence: And &s;he has been quiet till of late, only threatening and demanding. But now &s;he &s;eems, on this her marriage with Major O-Hara, to have meditated new &s;chemes, or is aim|ing, perhaps, at new methods to bring to bear an old one; of which Sir Charles had private intimation given him by one of the per&s;ons to whom, in her cups, &s;he once boa&s;ted of it: Which was, that as &s;oon as Mi&s;s Emily was marriageable, &s;he would endeavour, either by fair means, or foul, to get her into her hands: And if &s;he did, but for <HI>one</HI> week, &s;he &s;hould the <HI>next</HI> come out the wife of a man &s;he had in view, who would think half the fortune more than &s;ufficient for him&s;elf, and make over the other half to her; and then &s;he &s;hould come into her right, which &s;he deems to be half of the fortune of which her hu&s;band died po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This that follows is a copy of the letter left for Emily by this mother; which, tho' not well &s;pelled, might have been written by a better woman, who had hard&s;hips to complain of which might have intitled her to pity:</P>

<SALUTE>My dear <HI>Emily,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you have any love, any duty, left, for an un|happy mother who&s;e faults have been barbarou&s;ly aggravated, to ju&s;tify the ill u&s;age of a hu&s;band who was not faultle&s;s; I conjure you to in&s;i&s;t upon making me a vi&s;it, either at my new lodgings in Dean-&s;treet Soho; or that you will &s;end me word where I can &s;ee you, &s;uppo&s;ing I am not permitted to &s;ee you as this day, or that you &s;hould not be at Colnebrooke, where, it &s;eems, you have been &s;ome days. I cannot believe that your guardian, for his own reputation-&s;ake, as well as for ju&s;tice-&s;ake, as he is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a good man, will deny you, if you in&s;i&s;t upon it; as you ought to do, if you have half the love for me, that I have for you.</P>
<P>Can I doubt that you <HI>will</HI> in&s;i&s;t upon it; I cannot. I long to &s;ee you: I long to lay you in my bo&s;om. And I have given hopes to Major O-Hara, a man of one of the be&s;t families in Ireland, and a very worthy man, and a brave man too, who knows how to right an injured wife, if he is put to it, but who wi&s;hes to proceed amicably, that you will not &s;cruple, as my hu&s;band, to call him father.</P>
<P>I hear a very good account of your improvements, Emily; and I am told, that you are grown very tall, and pretty. O my Emily!&mdash;What a grievous thing is it to &s;ay, that I am <HI>told</HI> the&s;e things; and not to have been allowed to &s;ee you; and to behold your growth, and tho&s;e improvements, which mu&s;t rejoice my heart, and do, tho' I am &s;o ba&s;ely belied as I have been!

<P>My Lord thought fit to open this letter: He is &s;or|ry that he did; becau&s;e the poor girl is &s;o low-&s;pirit|ed, that he does not choo&s;e to let her &s;ee it; but will leave it to her guardian to give it to her, or not, as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on lifted up her hands and eyes as &s;he read it. Such a wretch as this, &s;aid &s;he, to remind Emily of God's judgments; and that line written as even as the re&s;t! How was it po&s;&s;ible, if her wicked heart could &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch words, that her fingers could &s;teadily write them? But indeed &s;he verifies the words of the wi&s;e man; <HI>There is no wickedne&s;s like the wick|edne&s;s of a woman.</HI></P>
<P>We all long to &s;ee Sir Charles. Poor Emily, in particular, will be unhappy till he comes.</P>
<P>While we expect a favoured per&s;on, tho' rich in the company of the friends we are with, what a di|minution does it give to enjoyments that would be complete were it not for that expectation? The mind is unea&s;y, not content with it&s;elf, and always looking out for the per&s;on wanted.</P>
<P>Emily was told, that her mother left a letter for her; but is advi&s;ed not to be &s;olicitous to &s;ee it till her guardian comes. My Lord owned to her, that he had opened it; and plea&s;ed tenderne&s;s, as he ju&s;tly might, in excu&s;e of having taken that liberty. She thanked his Lord&s;hip, and &s;aid, It was for &s;uch girls as &s;he to be directed by &s;uch good and kind friends.</P>
<P>She has ju&s;t now left me. I was writing, and

wanted to clo&s;e. I gave her a nod, with a &s;mile, as agreed upon a little before. Thank you, thank you, dear madam, &s;aid &s;he, for this freedom. She &s;topped at the door, and, with it in her hand, in a whi&s;pering accent, bending forwards, Only tell me, that you love me as well as you did in the chariot.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, I do; and better, I think, if po&s;|&s;ible: Becau&s;e I have been putting part of our conver|&s;ation upon paper, and &s;o have fa&s;tened your merits on my memory.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, madam, I am gone. And away &s;he tript.</P>
<P>But I will make her amends, before I go to re&s;t; and confirm all that I &s;aid to her in the chariot; for mo&s;t cordially I can.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>London, <DATE>Friday Night, Mar. <HI>17.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU wi&s;hed me, my dear Mrs. Selby, as I was obliged to go to London on my own affairs, to call at Colnebrooke, and to give you my ob&s;ervations on the &s;tate of matters there; and whether there were any likelihood of the event we are all &s;o de&s;irous &s;hould be brought about; and particularly, if an op|portunity offered, that I would at di&s;tance &s;ound Sir Charles him&s;elf on the &s;ubject. I told you, that you need not be afraid of my regard to our dear child's delicacy; and that &s;he her&s;elf &s;hould not have rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t me on this nice &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It &s;eems his great engagements in town, and &s;ome he has had in Kent, have hindered him from giving Lord L. and his &s;i&s;ters much of his company, tho'
<PB N="42" REF="45">
our Harriet is there; which they all extremely re|gret.</P>
<P>I dined at Colnebroke. Lord L. is a very worthy and agreeable man. Lady L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on are charming women. Mi&s;s Jervois is a pretty young Lady.&mdash;But more of her by-and-by.&mdash;The cou&s;in Grandi&s;on you &s;poke of, is gone down to Grandi&s;on|hall: whither Sir Charles him&s;elf thinks &s;hortly of going&mdash;But this and other di&s;tant matters I refer to our Harriet's own account.</P>
<P>My vi&s;it to Sir Charles is mo&s;t in my head, and I will mention that, and give place to other ob&s;erva|tions afterwards.</P>
<P>After dinner I pur&s;ued my journey to London. As my own bu&s;ine&s;s was likely to engage me for the whole time I had to &s;tay in town, I alighted at his hou&s;e in St. James's Square; and was immediately, on &s;ending in my name, introduced to him.</P>
<P>Let me &s;top to &s;ay, He is indeed a very fine gentle|man. Maje&s;ty and &s;weetne&s;s are mingled in every feature of his face; and the latter, rather than the former, predominates in his whole behaviour. Well may Harriet love him.</P>
<P>I told him, that I hoped, on my coming to town on particular affairs, he would excu&s;e the intru&s;ion of a man who was per&s;onally a &s;tranger to him; but who had long wi&s;hed for an opportunity to thank him for the relief he had given to a young lady in whom I claimed an intere&s;t that was truly paternal. At the &s;ame time I congratulated him on the noble manner in which he had extricated him&s;elf, to the confu&s;ion of men, whom he had taught to find out, and to be a&s;hamed, that they were &s;avages.</P>
<P>He received my compliments as a man might be &s;uppo&s;ed to do, to whom prai&s;e is not a new thing; and made me very hand&s;ome ones, declaring him&s;elf acquainted with my character, with my connections with your family, and with one of the mo&s;t excellent of
<PB N="43" REF="46">
young Ladies. This naturally introduced the prai&s;es of our Harriet; in which he joined in &s;o high and &s;o ju&s;t a &s;train, that I &s;aw his heart was touched. I am &s;ure it is: So &s;et yours at re&s;t. It mu&s;t do. Every|thing is moving, and that not &s;lowly, to the event &s;o de&s;ireable. I led to the graces of her per&s;on; he to tho&s;e of her mind&punc; He allowed her to be, for both, one of the mo&s;t perfect beauties he had ever &s;een. In &s;hort, Mrs. Selby, I am convinced, that the impor|tant affair will ripen of it&s;elf. His &s;i&s;ters, Lord L. Dr. Bartlett, all avowedly in our lovely girl's favour, and her merit &s;o extraordinary; it mu&s;t do. Don't you remember what the old &s;ong &s;ays?</P>
<LG>
<L>When <HI>Phoebus</HI> does his beams di&s;play,</L>
<L>To tell men gravely, that 'tis day,</L>
<L>Is, to &s;uppo&s;e them blind.</L>
</LG>
<P>All I want, methinks, is, to have them oftener to|gether. Idlene&s;s, I believe, is a great friend to Love. I wi&s;h his affairs would let him be a little idle. They mu&s;t be di&s;patched &s;oon, be they what they will; for Lord L. &s;aid, that when he is ma&s;ter of a &s;ubject, his execution is as &s;wift as thought, Sir Charles hinted, that he &s;hould &s;oon be obliged to go to France. Seas are nothing to him. Dr. Bartlett &s;aid, that he con|&s;iders all nations as joined on the &s;ame continent; and doubted not but if he had a call, he would undertake a journey to Con&s;tantinople or Pekin, with as little difficulty as &s;ome others would (he might have named me for one) to the Land's-end. Indeed he appears to be ju&s;t that kind of man. Yet he &s;eems not to have any of that &s;ort of fire in his con&s;titution, that goes off with a bounce, and leaves nothing but vapour aod &s;moke behind it.</P>
<P>You are in doubt about our girl's fortune. It is not a de&s;picable one. He may, no que&s;tion, have a woman with a much greater; and &s;o may &s;he a man.&mdash;What &s;ay you to Lady D's propo&s;al, rejected for his &s;ake;
<PB N="44" REF="47">
at <HI>hap-hazard</HI> too, as the &s;aying is? But let it once come to that que&s;tion, and leave it to <HI>me</HI> to an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>You bid me remark how Harriet looks. She is as lovely as ever; but I think, not quite &s;o lively, and &s;omewhat paler; but it is a clear and healthy, not a &s;ickly palene&s;s: And there is a languor in her fine eyes, that I never &s;aw in them before. She never was a pert girl; but &s;he has more meekne&s;s and humility in her countenance, than, methinks, I would <HI>wi&s;h</HI> her to have; becau&s;e it gives to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, who has fine &s;pirits, &s;ome advantages, in conver&s;ation, over Harriet, that, if &s;he <HI>had,</HI> methinks &s;he &s;hould not take. But they perfectly under&s;tand one another.</P>
<P>But now for a word or two about Mi&s;s Jervois. I could not but take notice to our Mi&s;s Byron, of the greedine&s;s, with which &s;he eats and drinks the prai&s;es given her guardian; of the glow that over&s;preads her cheeks, and of a &s;igh that now-and-then &s;eems to e&s;cape even her own ob&s;ervation, when he is &s;poken of; &s;o like a neice of mine, that drew her&s;elf in, and was afterwards unhappy; and by the&s;e &s;ymptoms I con|clude, that this young creature is certainly giving way to Love. She has a very great fortune, is a pretty girl, and an improving beauty. She is tall and womanly. I thought her &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen; but, it &s;eems, &s;he is hardly fourteen. There is as much difference in girls, as in fruits, as to their <HI>maturing,</HI> as I may &s;ay. My mother, I remember, once &s;aid of an early bloom in a neice of her's, that &s;uch were born to woe. I hope it won't be &s;o with this; for &s;he certainly is a good young creature, but has not had great opportu|nities of knowing either the world or her&s;elf. Brought up in a confined manner in her father's hou&s;e at Leg|horn, till twelve or thirteen; whatopportunities could &s;he have? No mother's wings to be &s;heltered under; Her mother's wickedne&s;s giving occa&s;ion the more to &s;treighten her education, and at a time of life &s;o young, and in &s;o re&s;training a country as Italy, for girls and
<PB N="45" REF="48">
young maidens; and, &s;ince brought over, put to board with a retired country gentlewoman&mdash;What can &s;he know, poor thing? She has been but a little while with Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, and that but as a gue&s;t: So that the world before her is all new to her: And, indeed, there &s;eems to be in her pretty wonder, and hone&s;t declarations of her whole heart, a &s;implicity that &s;ometimes borders upon childi&s;hne&s;s, tho' at other times a kind of womanly prudence. I am not afraid of her on our Harriet's account; and yet Harriet (Lover-like, perhaps!) was alarmed at my hinting it to her: But I am on <HI>her own.</HI> I wi&s;h, as I &s;aid before, Sir Charles were more among them: He would &s;oon di&s;cover who&s;e Love is fit to be di&s;countenanced, and who&s;e to be encouraged; and, by that means, give ea&s;e to twenty hearts. For I cannot believe that &s;uch a man as this would be <HI>guilty</HI> (I will call it) of re&s;erve to &s;uch a young Lady as ours, were he but to have the &s;hadow of a thought that he has an intere&s;t in her heart.</P>
<P>My affairs are more untoward than I expected: But on my return to Peterborough I will call at Shir|ley-hou&s;e and Selby-manor&mdash;and then (as I hope to &s;ee Sir Charles again, either in London, or at Colne|brooke) I will talk to you of all the&s;e matters. Mean time, believe me to be</P>

<P>AFTER we had taken leave of one another for the night, I tapt at Fmily's chamber-door; which being immediately opened by her maid, Is it you, my dear Mi&s;s Byron? &s;aid &s;he, running to me. How good this is!</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="49">
I am come, my dear, late as it is, to pa&s;s an agree|able half-hour with you, if it will not be un&s;ea&s;on|able.</P>
<P>That it can never be.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t then let your Anne go to bed, &s;aid I: El&s;e as her time is not her own, I &s;hall &s;horten my vi&s;it. I will a&s;&s;it you in any little &s;ervices my&s;elf. I have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Jenny.</P>
<P>God ble&s;s you, madam, &s;aid &s;he. You con&s;ider every-body. Anne tells me, that the &s;ervants, through|out the hou&s;e, adore you: And I am &s;ure their prin|cipals do.&mdash;Anne, you may go to your re&s;t.</P>
<P>Jenny, who attends me here, has more than once hinted to me, that Mi&s;s Jervois loves to &s;it up late, either reading, or being read to, by Anne; who, tho' &s;he reads well, is not fond of the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Servants, &s;aid I, are as &s;en&s;ible as their ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. They &s;peak to their feelings. I que|&s;tion not but they love Mi&s;s Jervois as well as they do me. I &s;hould as &s;oon choo&s;e to take my mea&s;ures of the goodne&s;s of principals by their &s;ervants love of them, as by any other rule. Don't you &s;ee, by the &s;ilent veneration and a&s;&s;iduities of the &s;ervants of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, how much they adore their ma&s;ter?</P>
<P>I am very fond of being e&s;teemed by &s;ervants, &s;aid &s;he, from that very ob&s;ervation of my guardian's goodne&s;s, and his &s;ervants worthine&s;s, as well as from what my maid tells me, all of them &s;ay of you. But you and my guardian are &s;o much alike in every thing, that you &s;eem to be born for one another.</P>
<P>And then &s;he &s;ighed, involuntarily; yet &s;eemed not to endeavour to re&s;train or recal her &s;igh.</P>
<P>Why &s;ighs my dear young friend? Why &s;ighs my Emily?</P>
<P>That's good of you, to call me <HI>you&punc;</HI> Emily. My guardian calls me <HI>his</HI> Emily. I am always proud when he calls me &s;o&mdash;I don't know why I &s;igh: But I have lately got a trick of &s;ighing, I think. Will

it do me harm? Anne tells me, it will; and &s;ays, I mu&s;t break my&s;elf of it. She &s;ays, is is not pretty in a young Lady to &s;igh: But where is the un-prettine&s;s of it?</P>
<P>Sighing is &s;aid to be a &s;ign of being in Love; and young Ladies&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah! madam! And yet <HI>you</HI> &s;igh, very often&mdash;</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf blu&s;h.</P>
<P>I often catch my&s;elf &s;ighing, my dear, &s;aid I. It is a <HI>trick,</HI> as you call it, which I would not have you learn.</P>
<P>But I have <HI>rea&s;on</HI> for &s;ighing, madam; which you have not&mdash;Such a mother!

<P>I wept on her neck; I could not help it: So <HI>duti|fully</HI> &s;en&s;ible of her calamity! and for <HI>&s;uch</HI> a cala|mity, who could forbear?</P>
<P>Such a di&s;grace too! &s;aid &s;he, rai&s;ing her head. Poor woman!&mdash;Yet &s;he has the wor&s;t of it. Do you think that <HI>that</HI> is not enough to make one &s;igh?</P>
<P>Amiable goodne&s;s! (ki&s;&s;ing her cheek) I &s;hall love you too well.</P>
<P>You are too good to me: You mu&s;t not be &s;o good to me: That, even <HI>that,</HI> will make me &s;igh. My <HI>guardian</HI>'s goodne&s;s to me gives me pain; and I think verily, I &s;igh more &s;ince la&s;t I left Mrs. Lane, and have &s;een more of his goodne&s;s, and how every-body admires, and owns obligation to him, than I did be|fore.&mdash;To have a &s;tranger, as one may &s;ay, and &s;o <HI>very</HI> fine a gentleman, to be &s;o good to one, and to have &s;uch an unhappy mother&mdash;who gives <HI>him</HI> &s;o much trouble&mdash;how can one help &s;ighing for both rea&s;ons?</P>

Dear girl! &s;aid I, my heart overflowing with com|pa&s;&s;ion for her, you and I are bound equally, by the tie of gratitude, to e&s;teem him.</P>
<P>Ah, madam! you will one day be the happie&s;t of all women&mdash;And &s;o you de&s;erve to be.</P>
<P>What means my Emily?</P>
<P>Don't I &s;ee, don't I hear, what is de&s;igned to be brought about by Lord and Lady L. and Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on? And don't I hear from my Anne, what every body expects and wi&s;hes for?</P>
<P>And <HI>does</HI> every-body expect and wi&s;h, my Emily&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;topped. She went on.&mdash;And don't I &s;ee that my guardian him&s;elf loves you?</P>
<P>Do you think &s;o, Emily?</P>
<P>O how he dwells upon your words, when you &s;peak!</P>
<P>You fan&s;y &s;o, my dear.</P>
<P>You have not ob&s;erved his eyes &s;o much as I have done, when he is in your company. I have watched <HI>your</HI> eyes, too; but have not &s;een that you mind him quite &s;o much as he does you.&mdash;Indeed he loves you dearly.&mdash;And then &s;he &s;ighed again.</P>

<P>Envy you!&mdash;I, &s;uch a &s;imple girl as I, envy you! No, indeed. Why &s;hould I envy you?&mdash;But tell me now; dear madam, tell me; Don't you love my guardian?</P>
<P>Every body does. You, my Emily, love him.</P>
<P>And &s;o I do: But you love him, madam, with a hope that no one el&s;e will have rea&s;on to entertain&mdash;Dear now, place a little confidence in your Emily: My guardian &s;hall never know it from me, by the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> hint.

<P><PB N="49" REF="52">
Will you, Emily, be as frank-hearted with me, as you would have me be with you?</P>
<P>Indeed I will.</P>
<P>I do, my dear, greatly e&s;teem your guardian.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;teem!</HI> Is that the word? Is that the Ladies word for Love? And is not the word <HI>Love,</HI> a pretty word for women? I mean no harm by it, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>And I am &s;ure you <HI>cannot</HI> mean harm: I will be &s;incere with my Emily. But you mu&s;t not let any one living know what I &s;ay to you of this nature. I would prefer your guardian, my dear, to a king, in all his glory.</P>
<P>And &s;o, madam, would I, if I were you. I &s;hould be glad to be thought like you in every-thing.</P>
<P>Amiable innocence! But tell me, Mi&s;s Jervois, Would you not <HI>have</HI> me e&s;teem your guardian? You know he was <HI>my</HI> guardian too, and that at an exigence when I mo&s;t wanted one.</P>
<P>Indeed I would. Would you have me wi&s;h &s;uch a good young Lady, as Mi&s;s Byron, to be ungrateful? No, indeed.&mdash;And again &s;he &s;ighed.</P>
<P>Why <HI>then</HI> &s;ighed my Emily? You &s;aid you would be frank-hearted.</P>
<P>So I will, madam. But I really can't tell why I &s;ighed then. I wi&s;h my guardian to be the happie&s;t man in the world: I wi&s;h you, madam, to be the hap|pie&s;t woman: And how can either be &s;o, but in one another?&mdash;But I am grieved, I believe, that there &s;eems to be &s;omething in the way of your mutual happine&s;s&mdash;I don't know whether that is all, neither&mdash;I don't know what it is&mdash;If I did, I would tell you&mdash;But I have &s;uch throbs &s;ometimes at my heart, as make me fetch my breath hard&mdash;I don't know what it is&mdash;Such a weight here, as <HI>makes</HI> me &s;igh; and I have a plea&s;ure, I think, becau&s;e I have an ea&s;e in &s;ighing&mdash;What can it be?&mdash;</P>
<P>Go on, my dear: You are a pretty de&s;criber.</P>
<P>Why now, if any-body, as Anne did la&s;t time my

I &s;hould &s;it down as much out of breath, as if I had ran down an high hill.&mdash;And, for half an hour, may be, &s;o trem|ble, that I &s;hould not be able to &s;ee the dear guardian that perhaps I had wanted to &s;ee. And to hear him with a voice of gentlene&s;s, as if he pitied me for having &s;o unhappy a mother, call me <HI>his</HI> Emily.&mdash;Don't you think he has a &s;weet voice?&mdash;And <HI>your</HI> voice, too, madam, is al&s;o <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;weet&mdash;Every-body &s;ays, that even in your common &s;peech your voice is melody.&mdash;Now Anne &s;ays&mdash;</P>
<P>O my agreeable little flatterer!</P>
<P>I don't flatter, madam. Don't call me a flatterer. I am a very &s;incere girl: Indeed I am.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay you are: But you rai&s;e my vanity, my dear. It is not <HI>your</HI> fault to tell me what people &s;ay of me; but it is <HI>mine</HI> to be proud of their com|mendations&mdash;But you were going to tell me what Anne &s;ays, on your being &s;o much affected, when &s;he tolls you in an hurry that your guardian is come?</P>
<P>Why Anne &s;ays, That all tho&s;e are &s;igns of Love. Fooli&s;h creature!&mdash;And yet &s;o they may: But not of &s;uch Love as &s;he means.&mdash;Such a Love as &s;he as good as owns &s;he had in her days of <HI>&s;lutteration,</HI> as &s;he whim&s;ically calls them; which, as &s;he explains it, were when &s;he was two or three years older than I am. In the fir&s;t place, I am very young, you know, madam; a mere girl: And &s;uch a &s;imple thing!&mdash;I never had a mother, nor &s;i&s;ter neither; nor a com|panion of my own &s;ex.&mdash;Mrs. Lane's daughters, what were they?&mdash;They looked upon me as a child as I was. In the next place, I do love my guardian, that's true: but with as much reverence, as if he were my father. I never had a thought that had not that deep, that profound reverence for him, as I re|member I had for my father.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="54">
But you had not, my dear, any of tho&s;e flutters, tho&s;e throbs, that you &s;poke of, on any returns of your father, after little ab&s;ences?</P>
<P>Why, no; I can't &s;ay I had. Nor, tho' I always rejoiced when my guardian came to &s;ee me at Mrs. Lane's, had I, as I remember, any &s;uch violent emotions, as I have had now of late. I don't know how it is&mdash;Can you tell me?</P>
<P>Do you not, Lucy, both love and pity this &s;weet girl?</P>
<P>My dear Emily!&mdash;The&s;e <HI>are</HI> &s;ymptoms, I doubt&mdash;</P>
<P>Symptoms of what, madam?&mdash;Pray tell me &s;in|cerely. I will not hide a thought of my heart from you.</P>
<P>If encouraged, my dear&mdash;</P>
<P>What then, madam?&mdash;</P>
<P>It <HI>would be</HI> Love, I doubt.&mdash;That &s;ort of Love that would make you unea&s;y&mdash;</P>
<P>No; that cannot be &s;urely. Why, madam, at that rate, I &s;hould never dare to &s;tand in your pre|&s;ence. Upon my word, I wi&s;h no one in the world, but you, to be lady Grandi&s;on. I have but one fear&mdash;</P>
<P>And what is that?</P>
<P>That my guardian won't love me &s;o well, when he marries, as he does now.</P>
<P>Are you afraid that the woman he marries will en|deavour to narrow &s;o large an heart as his?</P>
<P>No; not if that woman were you.&mdash;But, forgive my folly! (and &s;he looked down) he would not take my hand &s;o kindly as now he does: He would not look in my face with plea&s;ure, and with pity on my mother's account, as he does now: He would not call me <HI>his</HI> Emily: He would not be&s;peak ever one's regard for his ward.</P>
<P>My dear, you are now almo&s;t a woman. He will, if he remain a &s;ingle man, &s;oon draw back into his heart that kindne&s;s and love for you, which, while you
<PB N="52" REF="55">
are a girl, he &s;uffers to dwell upon his lips. You mu&s;t expect this change of behaviour &s;oon, from his pru|dence. You your&s;elf, my love, will &s;et him the ex|ample: You will grow more re&s;erved in your outward behaviour, than hitherto there was rea&s;on to be&mdash;</P>
<P>O, madam! never tell me that! I &s;hould break my heart, were I twenty, and he did not treat me with the tenderne&s;s that he has always treated me with. If, indeed, he find me an incroacher; if he find me for|ward, and indi&s;creet, and trouble&s;ome; then let him call me <HI>any</HI> -body's Emily, rather than <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>You will have different notions, my dear, before that time&mdash;</P>
<P>Then, I think, I &s;ha'n't de&s;ire to live to &s;ee the time. Why, madam, all the comfort I have to &s;et again&s;t my unhappine&s;s from my mother, is, that &s;o good, &s;o virtuous, and &s;o prudent a man as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, calls me <HI>his</HI> Emily, and loves me as his child. Would you, madam, were you Lady Gran|di&s;on (now, tell me, would you) grudge me the&s;e in|&s;tances of his favour and affection?</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, I would not: If I know my own heart, I would not.</P>
<P>And would you permit me to live with you?&mdash;Now it is out&mdash;Will you permit me to live with my guardian and you?&mdash;This is a que&s;tion I wanted to put to you; but was both a&s;hamed and afraid, till you thus kindly emboldened me.</P>
<P>Indeed I would, if your guardian had no objection.</P>
<P>That don't &s;atisfy me, madam. Would you be my earne&s;t, my &s;incere advocate, and plead for me? He would not deny you any-thing.

<P>The good Dr. Bartlett has obliged us all with the &s;ight of two letters, which give an account of what he has done for Lord W. his uncle. He has been more than a father to his <HI>uncle:</HI> Does not that &s;ound &s;trange? But he is to be the obliger of every-body.</P>

&s;uch of the letters as he was favoured with by Sir Charles, he believed he could not more unexception|ably oblige Lord L. and the &s;i&s;ters, than by reading to them tho&s;e two letters, as they were a kind of family &s;ubject.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as I had &s;een Mrs. Jervois to her chair, I went to attend Lord W.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="60">
He received me with great expre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem and affection.</P>
<P>He commanded his attendants to withdraw, and told me, taking my hand, that my character ro&s;e upon him from every mouth. He was in love with me, he &s;aid, I was my <HI>mother</HI>'s &s;on.</P>
<P>He commended me for my oeconomy, and compli|mented into <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> I had done to &s;ome of my <HI>friends.</HI></P>
<P>I frankly own, &s;aid he, that at your fir&s;t arrival, and even till <HI>now</HI> (that I am determined to be the man you, cou&s;in, would wi&s;h me to be) I had thought it but prudent to <HI>hold back.</HI> For I imagined, that your father had lived at &s;uch a rate, that you would have applied to me, to extricate you from difficulties; and particularly, for money to marry your elder &s;i&s;ter, at lea&s;t. I took notice, young man, proceeded he, and I heard others ob&s;erve, that you had not eyes to &s;ee any of your father's faults; either when he was living, or departed; and this gave me rea&s;on to ap|prehend, that you had your father's extravagant turn: And I was re&s;olved, if I were applied to, <HI>to wrap my|&s;elf clo&s;e about in a general denial.</HI> El&s;e, all I had been gathering together for &s;o many years pa&s;t, might &s;oon have been di&s;&s;ipated; and I &s;hould only have taken a thorn out of the foot of another, and put it into my own.</P>

My father, and your Lord&s;hip, continued I, had very different ways of thinking. Magnificence was his ta&s;te: Prudence (&s;o your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t account it) is yours. There are people in the world, who would give different names to both ta&s;tes: But would not your Lord&s;hip think it very pre&s;umptuous in any man to arraign you at the
<PB N="58" REF="61">
bar of his judgment, as mi&s;taken in the mea&s;ures of your prudence?</P>
<P>Look you, ne hew, I don't well know what to make of your &s;peech; but I judge, that you <HI>mean not</HI> to affront me.</P>
<P>I do not, my Lord. While you was apprehen&s;ive that you might be a &s;ufferer by me, you acted with your u&s;ual prudence to di&s;courage an application. My father had, in your Lord&s;hip's judgment, but one fault; and he was the principal &s;ufferer by it him&s;elf: Had he looked into his affairs, he would have avoided the nece&s;&s;ity of doing &s;everal things that were di&s;agreeable to him, and mu&s;t ever be, to a man of &s;pirit. His very timber, that <HI>required,</HI> as I may &s;ay, the ax, would have furni&s;hed him with all he wanted: And he paid intere&s;t for a le&s;s &s;um of money than actually was in the hands of his &s;tewards, unaccounted for.</P>
<P>But what a glory to <HI>you,</HI> cou&s;in&mdash;</P>
<P>No compliment to me, my Lord, I pray you, to the di&s;credit of my father's memory. He had a right to do what he did. Your Lord&s;hip does what you think fit. I too, now I am my own ma&s;ter, do as I plea&s;e. My ta&s;te is different from both. I pur&s;ue mine, as he did his. If I &s;hould happen to be more right than my father in &s;ome things, he might have the ad|vantage of me in others; and in tho&s;e I happen to do, that are generally thought laudable, what merit have I? Since all this time (directed by a natural bias) I am pur&s;uing my own predominant pa&s;&s;ion; and that, perhaps, with as much ardour, and as little power to re&s;i&s;t it as my father had to re&s;train his.</P>
<P>Bravo! bravo! &s;aid my Lord&mdash;Let me a&s;k you, nephew&mdash;May <HI>all</HI> young men, if they will, improve by travelling, as you have done?&mdash;If they may, by my troth nine parts in ten of tho&s;e who go abroad, ought to be hanged up at their fathers doors on their return.</P>
<P>Very &s;evere, my Lord. But thinking minds will be thoughtful, whether abroad or at home: Unthink|ing ones call for our pity.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="62">
Well, Sir, I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I am proud of my nephew, whatever you are of your uncle. And there are two or three things that I want to talk to you about; and one or two that I would con&s;ult you upon.</P>
<P>He rang, and a&s;ked, What time dinner would be ready?</P>
<P>In half an hour, was the an&s;wer.</P>
<P>Mrs. Gi&s;&s;ard came in. Her face glowed with pa&s;|&s;ion. My Lord &s;eemed affected at her entrance. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee, that they were upon ill terms with each other; and that my Lord was more afraid of her, than &s;he was of him.</P>
<P>She endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume a complai&s;ant air to me; but it was &s;o vi&s;ibly &s;truggled for, that it &s;at very auk|wardly on her countenance; and her lips trembled when &s;he broke &s;ilence, to a&s;k officiou&s;ly, as &s;he did, after the health of my &s;i&s;ter Charlotte.</P>
<P>I would be alone with my nephew, &s;aid my Lord, in a pa&s;&s;ionate tone.</P>
<P>You <HI>&s;hall</HI> be alone, my Lord, impertinently re|plied &s;he, with an air that looked as if they had quar|relled more then once before, and that &s;he had made it up on her own terms. She pulled the door after her with a rudene&s;s that he only could take, and de|&s;erve, who was con&s;cious of having degraded him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fooli&s;h woman; Why came &s;he in when I was there, except to &s;hew her &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;equence, at the expence of his honour? She knew what my opi|nion was of her. She would, by a third hand, once, have made overtures to me of her intere&s;t with my Lord; but I &s;hould have thought meanly of my&s;elf, had I not, with di&s;dain, rejected the tender of her &s;ervices.</P>
<P>A damned woman! &s;aid my lord; but looked; fi&s;t, as if he would be &s;ure &s;he was out of hearing.</P>
<P>This woman, nephew, and her behaviour, is one of the &s;ubjects I wanted to con&s;ult you upon.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63">
Defer this &s;ubject, my Lord, till you have reco|vered your temper. You did not de&s;ign to begin with it. You are di&s;compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>And &s;o I am: And he puffed, and panted, as if out of breath.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him &s;ome indifferent que&s;tions. To have followed him upon the &s;ubject at that time, whatever re&s;olutions he had taken; they would probably have gone off, when the pa&s;&s;ion, to which they would have owed their vigour, had &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>When he had an&s;wered them, his colour and his wrath went down together.</P>
<P>He then ran out into my prai&s;es again, and, parti|cularly, for my behaviour to Mrs. Oldham; who, he &s;aid, lived now very happily, and very exempla|rily; and never opened her lips, when &s;he was led to mention me, but with ble&s;&s;ings heaped upon me.</P>
<P>That woman, my Lord, &s;aid I was <HI>once</HI> good. A recovery, where a per&s;on is not totally abandoned, is more to be hoped for, than the reformation of one who never was well-principled. All that is wi&s;hed for, in the latter, is that &s;he may be made unhurtful: Her highe&s;t good was never more then harmle&s;&s;ne&s;s. She that was once good, cannot be ea&s;y, when &s;he is in a true &s;tate of penitence, till &s;he is re&s;tored to that from which &s;he was induced to depart.</P>
<P>You under&s;tand the&s;e matters, cou&s;in: I don't. But if you will favour me with more of your com|pany, I &s;hall, I believe, be the better for your no|tions. But I mu&s;t talk about this woman, nephew. I am calm now. I mu&s;t talk of this woman now&mdash;I am re&s;olved to part with her: I can bear her no longer. Did you n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> mind how &s;he pulled the door after her, tho' you were pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>I did, my Lord. But it was plain, that &s;omething di&s;agreeable had pa&s;&s;ed before; or &s;he could not &s;o in|tirely have forgot her&s;elf. But, my Lord, we will po&s;tpone this &s;ubject, if you plea&s;e. If you your&s;elf
<PB N="61" REF="64">
lead to it after dinner, I will attend to it, with all my heart.</P>
<P>Well, then, be it &s;o. But now tell me, Have you, nephew, any thoughts of marriage?</P>
<P>I have great honour for the &s;tate; an hope to be one day happy in it.</P>
<P>Well &s;aid&mdash;And are you at liberty, kin&s;man, to receive a propo&s;al of that nature?</P>
<P>And then, without waiting for my an&s;wer, he pro|po&s;ed Lady Frances N. and &s;aid, he had been &s;poken to on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that the Lady was very de&s;erving; but that I &s;hould think my&s;elf under too great obligations to a wife, for my own ea&s;e, if there were a woman in the world whom I could prefer to her.</P>
<P>Well, what think you of Lady Anne S.? I am told, that &s;he is likely to be the Lady. She has a noble fortune. Your &s;i&s;ters, I hear, are friends to Lady Anne.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ters wi&s;h me happily married. I have &s;uch an opinion of both tho&s;e Ladies, that it would give me &s;ome little pain, to imagine each would not, in her turn, refu&s;e me, were I offered to her, as I cannot, my&s;elf, make the offer. I cannot bear, my Lord, to think of returning &s;light for re&s;pect, to my <HI>own</HI> &s;ex: But as to Ladies; how can we expect that delicacy and dignity from them, which are the bulwarks of their virtue, if we do not treat them with dignity?</P>
<P>Charming notions! If you had them not abroad, you had them from your mother: She was all that was excellent in woman.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he was. Excellent woman! She was al|ways before my eyes.</P>
<P>And excellent kin&s;man too! Now I know your reverence for your mother, I will allow of all you &s;ay of your father; becau&s;e I &s;ee it is all from principle. I have known &s;ome men who have &s;poken with re|verence of their mothers, to give them&s;elves dignity:
<PB N="62" REF="65">
That is to &s;ay, for bringing creatures &s;o important as them&s;elves into the world, and who have exacted re|&s;pect to the good old women who were <HI>merely</HI> good old women, as we call them, in order to take the in|cen&s;e, offered the parent, into their own no&s;trils. This was duty in parade.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation my good Dr. Barlett, I thought above my Lord W. I think I have heard one like it, made by my father, who &s;aw very far into men; but was &s;ometimes led, by his wit, into &s;aying a &s;evere thing: And yet, whenever I hear a man prai&s;ed high|ly for the performance of common duties, as for be|ing a good hu&s;band, a good &s;on, or a kind father; tho' each is <HI>comparatively</HI> prai&s;e-worthy, I conclude, that there is nothing extraordinary to be &s;aid of him. To call a man a good FRIEND, is indeed comprizing all the duties in one word. For friend&s;hip is the balm, as well as &s;ea&s;oning, of life: And a man cannot be defective in <HI>any</HI> of the &s;ocial duties, who is capable of it, when the term is rightly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Well, cou&s;in, &s;ince you cannot think of either of tho&s;e Ladies, how &s;hould you like the rich and beau|tiful Counte&s;s of R.? You know what an excellent character &s;he bears.</P>
<P>I do. But, my Lord, I &s;hould not choo&s;e to mar|ry a widow: And yet, generally, I do not di&s;re&s;pect widows, nor imagine tho&s;e men to blame who marry them. But as my circum&s;tances are not unhappy, and as riches will never be my principal inducement in the choice of a wife, I may be allowed to indulge my peculiarities; e&s;pecially as I &s;hall hope (and I &s;hould not de&s;erve a good wife if I did not) that, when once married, I &s;hall be married for my whole life.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s once declared, &s;aid my Lord, before half a &s;core in company, two of them her particular admirers, That &s;he never would marry any man in the world, except he were ju&s;t &s;uch another, in mind and manners, as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="66">
Ladies, my Lord, who in ab&s;ence &s;peak favourably of a man that forms not preten&s;ions upon them, nor is likely to be trouble&s;ome to them, would &s;oon con|vince that man of his mi&s;take, were his pre&s;umption to ri&s;e upon their declared good opinions.</P>
<P>I wonder, proceeded my Lord, that every young man is not good. I have heard you, cou&s;in, prai&s;ed in all the circles where you have been mentioned. It was certainly an advantage to you to come back to us a &s;tranger, as I may &s;ay. Many youthful follies may perhaps be over-pa&s;&s;ed, that we &s;hall never know any-thing of: But, be that as it will, I can tell you, Sir, that I have heard &s;uch prai&s;es of you, as have made my eyes gli&s;ten, becau&s;e of my relation to you. I was told, within this month pa&s;t, that no fewer than Five Ladies, out of one circle, declared, that they would &s;tand out by con&s;ent, and let you pick and choo&s;e a wife from among them.</P>
<P>What your Lord&s;hip has heard of this nature, let me &s;ay, without affecting to di&s;claim a compliment apparently too high for my merits, is much more to the honour of the one &s;ex, than of the other. I &s;hould be glad, that policy, if not principle (principle might take root, and grow from it), would mend us men.</P>
<P>So &s;hould I, nephew: But I [Poor man! he hung down his head!] have not been a better man than I ought to be. Do you not de&s;pi&s;e me, in your heart, cou&s;in?&mdash;You mu&s;t have heard&mdash;That cur&s;ed wo|man&mdash;But I begin to repent! And the truly good, I believe, cannot be either cen&s;orious, or uncharitable. Tell me, however, Do you not de&s;pi&s;e me?</P>
<P>De&s;pi&s;e my mother's brother! No, my Lord. Yet were a &s;overeign to warrant my freedom, and there was a likelihood that he would be the better for it; I would, with decency, tell him my whole mind. I am &s;orry to &s;ay it; but your Lord&s;hip, if you have not had virtue to make you worthy of being imitated,
<PB N="64" REF="67">
has too many examples among the great, as well as among the middling, to cau&s;e you to be cen&s;ured for <HI>&s;ingularity.</HI> But your Lord&s;hip adds, to a confe&s;&s;ion that is not an ungenerous one, that you begin to repent.</P>
<P>Indeed I do. And your character, cou&s;in, has made me half-a&s;hamed of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am not accu&s;tomed, my Lord, to harangue on the&s;e &s;ubjects to men who know their duty: But let me &s;ay, That your Lord&s;hip's good re&s;olutions, to be efficacious, mu&s;t be built upon a better foundation than occa&s;ional di&s;gu&s;t or di&s;obligation. But here, again, we are verging to a &s;ubject that we are both agreed to defer till after dinner.</P>
<P>I am charmed with your treatment of me, cou&s;in. I &s;hall, for my own &s;ake, adore my &s;i&s;ter's &s;on. Had I con&s;ulted my chaplain, who is a good man too, he would have too roughly treated me.</P>
<P>Divines, my Lord, mu&s;t do their duty.</P>
<P>He then introduced the affair between Sir Hargrave Pollexfen and me, of which, I found, he was more particularly informed, than I could have imagined: And after he had launched out upon that, and upon my refu&s;al of a duel, he, by a tran&s;ition that was very natural, mentioned the <HI>re&s;cued Lady,</HI> as he called her. I have heard, cou&s;in, &s;aid he, that &s;he is the mo&s;t beautiful woman in England.</P>
<P>I think her &s;o, my Lord, replied I: And &s;he has one excellence, that I never before met with in a Beauty: She is not proud of it.</P>
<P>I then gave my opinion of Mi&s;s Byron in &s;uch terms, as made my Lord challenge me, as my &s;i&s;ters once did, on the warmth of my de&s;cription and prai&s;es of her.</P>
<P>And does your Lord&s;hip think, that I cannot do ju&s;tice to the merits of &s;uch a Lady as Mi&s;s Byron, but with an intere&s;ted view? I do a&s;&s;ure you, that what I have &s;aid, is &s;hort of what I think of her.
<PB N="65" REF="68">
But I can prai&s;e a Lady, without meaning a com|pliment to my&s;elf. I look upon it, however, as one of the mo&s;t fortunate accidents of my life, that I have been able to &s;erve her, and &s;ave her from a forced marriage with a man whom &s;he di&s;liked, and who could not de&s;erve her. There is hardly any-thing gives me more pain, than when I &s;ee a worthy woman very unequally yoked, if her own choice has not been at fir&s;t con&s;ulted; and who yet, tho' deeply &s;en&s;ible of her misfortune, irreproachably &s;upports her part of the yoke.</P>
<P>You are a great friend to the &s;ex, kin&s;man.</P>
<P>I am. I think the man who is not, mu&s;t have fal|len into bad company; and de&s;erves not to have been favoured with better. Yet to unwomanly faults, to want of morals, and even to want of delicacy, no man is more quick&s;ighted.</P>
<P>I don't know how it is; but <HI>I</HI> have not, at this rate, fallen into the be&s;t company: But perhaps it is for want of that delicacy, in my own mind, which you are &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>Were we men, my Lord, to value women (and to let it be known that we do) for tho&s;e qualities which are principally valuable in the &s;ex; the le&s;s e&s;timable, if they would not be reformed, would &s;hrink out of our company, into company more &s;uit|able to their ta&s;te; and we &s;hould never want objects worthy of our knowledge, and even of our admiration, to a&s;&s;ociate with. There is a kind of magneti&s;m in goodne&s;s. Bad people will indeed find out bad people, and confederate with them, in order to keep one an|other in countenance; but they are bound together by a rope of &s;and; while tru&s;t, confidence, love, &s;ympathy, and a reciprocation of beneficent actions, twi&s;t a cord which ties good men to good men, and cannot be ea&s;ily broken.</P>
<P>I have never had the&s;e notions, cou&s;in; and yet they are good ones. I took people as I found them; and
<PB N="66" REF="69">
to own the truth, meaning to &s;erve my&s;elf, rather than any-body el&s;e, I never took pains to look out for worthy attachments. The people I had to do with, had the &s;ame views upon <HI>me,</HI> as I had upon <HI>them;</HI> and thus I went on in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with all men; mi&s;tru&s;ting and guarding, as well as I could, and not doubting that every man I had to do with would im|po&s;e upon me, if I placed a confidence in him: But as to this Mi&s;s Byron, nephew, I &s;hall never re&s;t till I &s;ee her&mdash;Pray what is her fortune? They tell me, it is not above 15000<HI>l.</HI> &mdash;What is that, to the offers you have had made you?</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then we were told, dinner was on the table.</P>
<P>I am wi&s;hing for an inclination to re&s;t; but it flies me. The la&s;t Letter from Beauchamp, dated from Bologna, as well as tho&s;e from the Bi&s;hop, afflict me. Why have I &s;uch a feeling heart? Were the unhappy &s;ituation of affairs there owing to my own enter|prizing &s;pirit, I &s;hould de&s;erve the pain it gives me. But I &s;hould be too happy, had I not the&s;e <HI>without|door</HI> perplexities, as I may call them, to torment me. Thank God that they ari&s;e not from <HI>within,</HI> tho' they make them&s;elves too ea&s;y a pa&s;&s;age to my heart!</P>
<P>My paper is written out. If I am likely to find a drow&s;y moment, I &s;hall welcome its approach: If not, I will ri&s;e, and continue my &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER X.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON,</HI> To Dr. <HI>BARTLETT.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday Mar. <HI>19.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had two happy hours of forgetfulne&s;s. I could not, tho' I tried for it, prevail for more: And I will continue my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>After dinner, every attendant being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, my Lord, making me fir&s;t &s;ee that nobody was li&s;tening n the pa&s;&s;ages, began as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70">
I am determined, nephew, to part with this Gif|fard. She is the plague of my life. I would have done it half a year ago, on an occa&s;ion that I will not mention to you, becau&s;e you would de&s;pi&s;e me, if I did, for my weakne&s;s: And now &s;he wants to bring in upon me, a &s;i&s;ter of hers, and her hu&s;band, and to part with two other worthy folks, that I know love me; but of whom, for that rea&s;on, &s;he is jea|lous; and then they would divide me among them: For this man and his wife have &s;ix children; all of whom, of late, make an appearance that cannot be hone&s;tly &s;upported.</P>
<P>And have you any difficulty, my Lord, in parting with her, but what ari&s;es from your own want of re|&s;olution?</P>
<P>The mo&s;t in&s;olent devil that ever was about a man at one time, and the mo&s;t whining at another. Don't de&s;pi&s;e me, nephew; you know I have taken her as&mdash;You know what I mean&mdash;</P>
<P>I under&s;tand you, my Lord.</P>
<P>But &s;ay, you don't de&s;pi&s;e me, Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on. As I hope to live, I am half afraid of you.</P>
<P>My pity, my Lord, where I &s;ee compunction, is &s;tronger than my cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>That is well &s;aid.&mdash;Now I agreed with this woman, in a weak moment, and &s;he has held me to it, to give her an annuity of 150<HI>l.</HI> for life; which was to be made up 250<HI>l.</HI> if I parted with her, without her con&s;ent; and here we have been, for &s;everal months, plaguing one another, whether I &s;hall turn her out of the hou&s;e, or &s;he will leave me: For &s;he has told me, that &s;he will not &s;tay, unle&s;s I take in her &s;i&s;ter and brother; yet will not go, becau&s;e &s;he will then have no more than the 150<HI>l.</HI> a year. And that is too much for her de&s;erts for the&s;e two years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip &s;ees the inconveniencies of this way of life; and I need not mention to you, how
<PB N="68" REF="71">
much happier that &s;tate is, which binds a man and woman together by intere&s;t, as well as by affection, if di&s;cretion be not forgotten in the choice. But let me expre&s;s my &s;urprize, that your Lord&s;hip, who has &s;o ample an e&s;tate, and no child &s;hould &s;eem to value your peace of mind at &s;o low a rate as 100<HI>l.</HI> a year.</P>
<P>I will not let her go away with &s;uch a triumph. She has not de&s;erved from me&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, my Lord, was &s;he of reputation when you took her?</P>
<P>She was a widow&mdash;</P>
<P>But was her character tolerable in the eye of the world? She might be a greater object of pity for be|ing a widow.</P>
<P>My gouty di&s;orders made me want a woman about me. I hated men-fellows&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, my Lord, this regards your <HI>motive.</HI> But have you any previous or later incontinence to charge her with?</P>
<P>I can't &s;ay I have. Her cur&s;ed temper would frighten, rather than invite, Lovers. I <HI>heard,</HI> it was no good one; but it broke not out to me till within the&s;e two years.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip, &s;urely, mu&s;t not di&s;pute the mat|ter with her. If you are determined to part with her, give her the 250<HI>l.</HI> a year, and let her go.</P>
<P>To reward a cur&s;ed woman for mi&s;behaviour!&mdash;I cannot do it.</P>
<P>Give me leave to &s;ay, that your Lord&s;hip has de|&s;erved &s;ome puni&s;hment: Give her the annuity, not as a reward to her, but as a puni&s;hment to your&s;elf.</P>
<P>You hurt my &s;ore place, nephew.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, my Lord, that 250<HI>l.</HI> a year for life, or even for ever, is a poor price, for the reputation of a woman with whom a man of your quality and fortune conde&s;cended to enter into treaty. Every quarterly payment mu&s;t &s;trike her to the heart, if &s;he live to have compunction &s;eize her, when &s;he thinks that &s;he
<PB N="69" REF="72">
is receiving, for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, the wages of her &s;hame. Be that her puni&s;hment. You intimate, that &s;he has &s;o behaved her&s;elf, that &s;he has but few friends: Part with her, without giving her cau&s;e of complaint, that may engage pity for her, if not friends, at your ex|pence. A woman who has lo&s;t her reputation, will not be regardful of yours. Suppo&s;e &s;he &s;ue you for non-performance of covenants: Would your Lord|&s;hip appear to &s;uch a pro&s;ecution? You cannot be <HI>capable</HI> of pleading your privilege on &s;uch a pro&s;ecu|tion as would otherwi&s;e go again&s;t you. You cannot be in earne&s;t to part with this woman, &s;he cannot have offended you beyond forgivene&s;s, if you &s;cruple 100<HI>l.</HI> a year to get rid of her.</P>
<P>He &s;ervently &s;wore, that he was in earne&s;t; and added, I am re&s;olved, nephew, to marry, and live hone&s;t.</P>
<P>He looked at me, as if he expected that I &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>I believe I could not change countenance, on &s;uch an hint as this. You have come to a good re&s;olution, my Lord; and if you marry a prudent woman, your Lord&s;hip will find the difference in your own reflex|ions, as well as in your reputation and intere&s;t.

<P>I know, my Lord, that I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e my&s;elf, were I not to deal freely with you in this re&s;pect. In|deed, my Lord, you have not had &s;o good rea&s;on (for|give me!) to think hardly of my father's &s;pirit, as you had to correct your own.</P>
<P>I cannot bear this, nephew. He looked di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not be angry, my Lord. I will not bear anger from any man breathing, and keep him com|pany, who, con&s;ulting me, &s;hall be di&s;plea&s;ed with me for &s;peaking my mind with freedom and &s;ince|rity.</P>

What a man am I talking to!&mdash;Well, rid me of this torment [You have &s;pirit, nephew; and nobody can reproach you with acting contrary to your own principles] and I will for ever love you. But talk to her: I hardly dare. She whimpers and &s;obs, and threatens, by turns, and I cannot bear it.&mdash;Once &s;he was going to tie her&s;elf up&mdash;Would to God I had not prevented her&mdash;And then (O my folly!) we went on again.</P>
<P>My good Dr. Bartlett, I was a&s;hamed of my uncle. But you &s;ee what an artful, as well as in&s;olent woman, this is. What &s;olly is there in wickedne&s;s! Folly en|counters with folly, or how could it &s;ucceed &s;o often as it does?&mdash;Yet my mother's brother to wi&s;h he had &s;uffered a creature, with whom he had been familiar, to de&s;troy her&s;elf!&mdash;I could hardly bear him. Only that I thought it would be &s;erving both wretches, and giving both a chance for repentance; or I &s;hould not have kept my &s;eat&mdash;But we &s;ee in my mother, and in her brother, how habitual wickedne&s;s deba&s;es, and how habitual goodne&s;s exalts, the human mind. In their youth they were &s;uppo&s;ed nearer an equality in their under&s;tandings and attainments, than in their maturity, when occa&s;ion called out into action their re&s;pective talents. But perhaps the brother was not the better man for the uninterrupted pro&s;perity that attended him, and for having never met with check or controul; whereas the mo&s;t happily married woman in the world mu&s;t have a will to which &s;he mu&s;t &s;ome|times re&s;ign her own. What a glory to a good woman mu&s;t it be, who can not only re&s;ign her will, but make &s;o happy an u&s;e of her re&s;ignation, as my mother did!</P>
<P>My Lord repeated his reque&s;t, that I would talk with the woman; and that directly.</P>
<P>I withdrew, and &s;ent for her, accordingly.</P>
<P>She came to me, out of breath with pa&s;&s;ion; and, as I thought, partly with apprehen&s;ion for what her own behaviour might be before me.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="74">
I &s;ee, Mrs. Giffard, &s;aid I, that you are in great emotion. I am de&s;ired to talk with you; a ta&s;k I am not very fond of: But you will find nothing but civility, &s;uch as is due to you, for your &s;ex's &s;ake, from me. Calm, therefore, your mind: I will &s;ee you again, in a few moments.</P>
<P>I took a turn, and &s;oon came back. Her face looked not quite &s;o bloated; and &s;he bur&s;t into tears. She began to make a merit of her &s;ervices; her care; her hone&s;ty; and then inveighed again&s;t my Lord for the narrowne&s;s of his &s;pirit. She paid &s;ome compli|ments to me, and talked of being a&s;hamed to appear before me as a guilty creature; introductory to what &s;he was prepared to &s;ay of her &s;acrifices, the lo&s;s of her good name, and the like; on which, with re&s;pect to my Lord, and his ingratitude to her, as &s;he called it, &s;he laid great &s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I am never di&s;plea&s;ed, my dear friend, with the te&s;timony which the mo&s;t profligate women bear to the honour of virtue, when they come to &s;et a value upon their departure from it.</P>
<P>You have it not to &s;ay, Mrs. Giffard, that my Lord betrayed, &s;educed, or deceived you. I &s;ay not this &s;o much for reproach, as for ju&s;tice-&s;ake; and not to &s;uffer you to deceive your&s;elf, and to load him with greater faults than he has been guilty of. You were your own mi&s;tre&s;s: You had no father, mother, hu&s;band, to que&s;tion you, or to be offended with you. You knew your duty. You were treated with as a &s;ole and independent per&s;on. One hundred and fifty pounds a year, Mrs. Giffard, tho' a &s;mall price for the virtue of a good woman, which is indeed above all price, is, neverthele&s;s, greatly above the price of common &s;ervice. I never &s;eek to palliate faults of a flagrant nature: tho' it is not my meaning to a&s;&s;ront, a woman e&s;pecially, and one who &s;uppo&s;es her&s;elf in di&s;tre&s;s. You <HI>mu&s;t know,</HI> madam, the frail tenure by which you are likely to hold: You &s;tipulated,
<PB N="72" REF="75">
therefore, for a provi&s;ion, accordingly. The woman who never hoped to be a wife, can have no hard&s;hips to take the &s;tipulation, and once more give her&s;elf the opportunity to recover her lo&s;t fame. This inde|pendence my Lord is de&s;irous to give you&mdash;</P>
<P>What independence, Sir?</P>
<P>One hundred and fifty&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Two</HI> hundred and fifty, Sir, if you plea&s;e&mdash;If my Lord thinks fit to di&s;mi&s;s me.</P>
<P>My Lord has told me, that <HI>that</HI> was indeed the &s;ti|pulation; but he pleads mi&s;behaviour.</P>
<P>I was willing to make a little difficulty of the 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year, tho' I thought my <HI>Lord</HI> ought not&mdash;And as to mi&s;behaviour, Dr. Bartlett, I hardly know how to puni&s;h a woman for that, to her keeper. Does &s;he not fir&s;t mi&s;behave to her&s;elf, and to the laws of God and man? And ought a man, that brings her to vio|late her fir&s;t duties, to expect from her a regard to a mere di&s;cretionary obligation? I would have all the&s;e <HI>morali&s;ts,</HI> as they affect to call them&s;elves, &s;uffer by &s;uch libertine principles as cannot be pur&s;ued, but in violation of the very fir&s;t laws of morality.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;behaviour!</HI> Sir. He makes this plea to cover his own ba&s;ene&s;s of heart. I never mi&s;behaved, as he calls it, till I &s;aw&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, madam, this may lead to a debate that can an&s;wer no end. I pre&s;ume, you are as willing to leave my Lord, as he is to part with you. It mu&s;t be a wretchedne&s;s beyond what I can well imagine, to live a life of guilt (I mu&s;t not palliate in this ca&s;e) and yet of hatred and animo&s;ity, with the per&s;on who is a partaker in that guilt.</P>
<P>I am put upon a very unequal ta&s;k, Sir, to talk with you on this &s;ubject. My Lord will not refu&s;e to &s;ee me, I hope. I know what to &s;ay to him.</P>
<P>He has reque&s;ted me to talk with you, madam. As I told you, I am not fond of the ta&s;k. We have all our faults. God knows what he will pardon, and
<PB N="73" REF="76">
what he will puni&s;h. His pardon, however, in a great mea&s;ure depends upon your&s;elf. You have health and time, to all appearance, before you: Your future life may be a life of penitence. I am no divine, madam; I would not be thought to preach to you: But you have now a pro&s;pect opened of future hap|pine&s;s, thro' your mutual mi&s;under&s;tandings, that you never otherwi&s;e <HI>might</HI> have had. And let me make an ob&s;ervation to you; That where hate or di&s;like have once taken place of liking, the fir&s;t &s;epa|ration, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, is always the be&s;t. Affection or e&s;teem between man and woman, once forfeited, hardly ever is recovered. Tell me truth&mdash;Don't you as heartily di&s;like my Lord, as he does you?</P>
<P>I do, Sir&mdash;He is&mdash;</P>
<P>I will not hear <HI>what</HI> he is, from the mouth of de|clared prejudice. He has his faults. One great fault is, that which you have been joint partakers in&mdash;But if you might, would you choo&s;e to live together to be torments to each other?</P>
<P>I can torment him more than he can me&mdash;</P>
<P>Diabolical temper!&mdash;Woman! (and I &s;tood up, and looked &s;ternly) Can you forget <HI>to</HI> whom you &s;ay this&mdash;and <HI>of</HI> whom?&mdash;Is not Lord W. my uncle?</P>
<P>This (as I intended it &s;hould) &s;tartled her.&punc;She a&s;ked my pardon.</P>
<P>What a fine hand, proceeded I, has a Peer of the realm made of it! to have this &s;aid <HI>of</HI> him, and per|haps, had you been in his pre&s;ence, <HI>to</HI> him, by a woman who&s;e courage is founded in his weakne&s;s?&mdash;Let me tell you, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>She held up her cla&s;ped hands&mdash;For God's &s;ake, for|give me, Sir! and &s;tand my friend.</P>
<P>An hundred and fifty pounds a year, madam, is rich payment for <HI>any</HI> con&s;ideration that a woman could give, who has more &s;pirit than virtue. Had you kept that, madam, you would, tho' the daughter of cot|tagers,
<PB N="74" REF="77">
have been &s;uperior to the greate&s;tman on earth, who wanted to corrupt you.&mdash;But thus far, and as a puni&s;hment to my Lord for his wilful weakne&s;s, I <HI>will</HI> be your friend&mdash;Retire from my Lord: You &s;hall have 250<HI>l.</HI> a year: And as you were not brought up to the expectation of one half of the fortune, be&s;tow the hundred a year, that was in debate, upon young creatures of your &s;ex, as an encouragement to them to pre&s;erve that cha&s;tity, which you, with your eyes open, gave up; and, with the re&s;t, live a life &s;uitable to that di&s;po&s;ition; and then, as my fellow-creature, I will wi&s;h you happy.</P>
<P>She begged leave to withdraw: She could not, &s;he &s;aid, &s;tand in my pre&s;ence. I had, indeed, &s;poken with warmth. She withdrew, trembling, courte&s;ying, mortified; and I returned to my Lord.</P>
<P>He was very earne&s;t to hear my report. I again put it to him, Whether he adhered to his re&s;olution of parting with his woman? He declared in the affirm|ative, with greater earne&s;tne&s;s than before; and begged to know, if I could manage it that &s;he &s;hould go, and that without &s;eeing him? I cannot bear to &s;ee her, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>Bravoes of the Law, cowards and cullies to their paramours, are the&s;e keepers, generally. I have ever &s;u&s;pected the courage (to magnanimity they mu&s;t be &s;trangers) of men who can de&s;y the laws of &s;ociety. I pitied him: And believing that it would not be diffi|cult to manage this heroine, who had made her weak Lord afraid of her; I &s;aid, Have you a mind, my Lord, that &s;he &s;hall quit the hou&s;e this night, and before I leave it? If you have, I think I can under|take, that &s;he &s;hall.</P>
<P>And can you do this for me? If you can, you &s;hall be my great Apollo. That will, indeed, make me happy: For the moment you are gone, &s;he will force her&s;elf into my pre&s;ence, and will throw the gout, per|haps, into my &s;tomach. She reproaches me, as if &s;he
<PB N="75" REF="78">
had been an innocent woman, and I the mo&s;t un|grateful of men. For God's &s;ake, nephew, relea&s;e me from her, and I &s;hall be happy. I would have left her behind me in the country, proceeded he, but &s;he would come with me. She was afraid that I would appeal to you: She &s;tands in awe of nobody el&s;e. You will be my guardian Angel, if you will rid me of this plague.</P>
<P>Well, then, my Lord, you will leave it to me to do the be&s;t I can with her: But it cannot be the be&s;t on your &s;ide, for your honour's &s;ake, if we do her not that ju&s;tice that the law would, or ought to do her. In a word, my Lord, you mu&s;t forgive me for &s;aying, that you &s;hall not re&s;ume that dignity to di|&s;tre&s;s this woman, which you laid a&s;ide when you en|tered into treaty with her.</P>
<P>Well, well, I refer my&s;elf to your management: Only this 100<HI>l.</HI> a year&mdash;Once again, I &s;ay, it would hurt me to reward a woman for plaguing me: And 150<HI>l.</HI> a year is two-thirds more than ever &s;he, or any of her family, were intitled to.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t and meane&s;t are intitled to ju&s;tice, my Lord; and I hope your Lord&s;hip will not refu&s;e to perform engagements that you entered into with your eyes open: You mu&s;t not, if I take any concern in this affair.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then the woman &s;ent in, to beg the favour of an audience, as &s;he called it, of me.</P>
<P>She addre&s;&s;ed me in terms above her education. There is &s;omething, &s;aid &s;he, in your countenance, Sir, &s;o terrible, and yet &s;o &s;weet, that one mu&s;t fear your anger, and yet hope for your forgivene&s;s, when one has offended. I was too free in &s;peaking of my Lord to his nephew&mdash;And then &s;he made a compli|ment to my character, and told me, She would be determined by my plea&s;ure, be it what it would.</P>
<P>How &s;eldom are violent &s;pirits true &s;pirits! When over-awed, how tame are they, generally, in their
<PB N="76" REF="79">
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion! Yet this woman was not without art in hers. She &s;aw, that, di&s;plea&s;ed as &s;he apprehended I was with her, I had given her hopes of the payment of the hundred pounds a year penalty; and this made her &s;o acquie&s;cent.</P>
<P>I was indeed di&s;plea&s;ed with you, Mrs. Giffard; and could not, from what you &s;aid, but conclude in your disfavour, in ju&s;tification of my Lord's complaints again&s;t you.</P>
<P>Will you give me leave, Sir, to lay before you the true &s;tate of every-thing between my Lord and me? Indeed, Sir, you don't know&mdash;</P>
<P>When two per&s;ons, who have lived in familiarity, differ, the fault is &s;eldom wholly on one &s;ide: But thus far I judge between you, and de&s;ire not to hear particulars: The man who di&s;pen&s;es with a known duty, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this before us, mu&s;t render him&s;elf de&s;picable in the eyes of the very per&s;on whom he rai&s;es into con&s;equence by &s;inking his own. Cha&s;tity is the crown and glory of a woman. The mo&s;t profligate of men love mode&s;ty in the &s;ex, at the very time they are forming plots to de&s;troy it in a par|ticular object. When a woman has &s;ubmitted to put a price upon her honour, &s;he mu&s;t appear, at times, de&s;picable in the eyes even of her &s;educer; and when the&s;e two break out into animo&s;ity, ought either to wi&s;h to live with the other?</P>
<P>Indeed, indeed, Sir, I am &s;truck with remor&s;e: I &s;ee my error. And &s;he put her handkerchief to her eyes, and &s;eemed to weep.</P>
<P>I proceeded; You, Mrs. Giffard, doubted the con|tinuance of my Lord's pa&s;&s;ion: You made your terms, therefore, and propo&s;ed a penalty be&s;ides. My Lord &s;ubmitted to the terms, and by that means &s;e|cured his right of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing you, at his plea&s;ure; the only conveniency, that a man di&s;honouring him&s;elf by de&s;pi&s;ing marriage, can think he has. Between him and you, what remains to be &s;aid (tho' you are both
<PB N="77" REF="80">
an&s;werable at a tribunal higher than your own) but that you &s;hould have &s;eparated long ago? Yet you would not con&s;ent to it: You would not leave him at liberty to a&s;&s;ert the right he had re&s;erved to him&s;elf. Strange weakne&s;s in him, that he would &s;uffer that to depend upon you! But one weakne&s;s is the parent of another,</P>
<P>She then vi&s;ibly wept.</P>
<P>You found it out, that you could <HI>torment your Lord in an higher degree, than he could torment you;</HI> and how, acting upon &s;uch principles, you have lived to|gether for &s;ome time pa&s;t, you have let every one &s;ee.</P>
<P>She, on her knees, be&s;ought my pardon for the free|dom of that expre&s;&s;ion; not from motives of con|trition, as I apprehend; but from tho&s;e of policy.</P>
<P>She was &s;trong enough to rai&s;e her&s;elf, without my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She did, unbidden, on &s;eeing me &s;tep backward a pace or two, to give her an opportunity to do &s;o; and looked very &s;illy; and the more, for having mi&s;&s;ed my a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand: By which I &s;up|po&s;ed, that &s;he had u&s;ually better &s;ucce&s;s with my Lord, whenever &s;he had prevailed on her&s;elf to kneel to him.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y, my good Dr. Bartlett, from &s;mall cre|vices, to di&s;cover day in an artful woman's heart. No|thing can be weaker, in the eye of an ob&s;erver, who him&s;elf di&s;dains artifice, than a woman who makes artifice her &s;tudy. In &s;uch a departure from hone&s;t nature, there will be &s;uch curvings, that the eyes, the countenance, mu&s;t ever betray the heart; while the lips, either breaking out into apologies, or aiming at re&s;erve, confirm the &s;u&s;picion, that all is not right in the mind.</P>
<P>I excu&s;e you, Mrs. Giffard, &s;aid I; my Lord has de&s;ervedly brought much of what has di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him, upon him&s;elf: But now it is be&s;t for you to part. My Lord choo&s;es not to &s;ee you. I would advi&s;e you to remove this very afternoon.</P>

<P>Yes, for the whole &s;um.</P>
<P>I will, Sir, with all my heart and &s;oul. Mo&s;t of my things are in the conntry. My Lord came up in a pa&s;&s;ion, to talk with you, Sir. Two or three band|boxes are all I have here.

<P>You are to do with the whole annuity as you plea&s;e. If your relations are worthy, you cannot do better than to relieve their nece&s;&s;ities. But remember, Mrs. Giffard, that every quarter brings you the wages of iniquity, and endeavour at &s;ome atonement.</P>
<P>The woman could too well bear this &s;everity.</P>
<P>Had a finger been &s;ufficient to have made her feel, I would not have laid upon her the weight of my whole hand.</P>

He got up, and embraced me, and called me his good Angel. I advi&s;ed him to give his orders to Halden, or to whom he thought &s;it, to do her and him&s;elf ju&s;tice, as to what belonged to her in the country.</P>
<P>But the terms! the terms! cried my Lord. If you have brought me off for 150 <HI>l.</HI> I will adore you.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the terms (You promi&s;ed to leave them to me): You pay no more than 150 <HI>l.</HI> a year for her life, till you a&s;&s;ure me, upon your honour, that you chearfully, and on mature con&s;ideration, make it up 250 <HI>l.</HI></P>

<P>But how did you manage it, kin&s;man?&mdash;I never &s;hould have brought her to any-thing. How did you manage it?</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip does not repent her going?</P>
<P>He &s;wore, that it was the happie&s;t event that could have befallen him. I hope, &s;aid, he, &s;he will go with|out wi&s;hing to &s;ee me. Whether &s;he would whine, or cur&s;e, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ee her, and be my&s;elf.</P>

<P>Thank God! a fair riddance! Thank God!</P>
<P>But is it po&s;&s;ible, kin&s;man, that you could bring me off for 150 <HI>l.</HI> a year? Tell me, truly.</P>
<P>It is: And I tell your Lord&s;hip, that it &s;hall co&s;t you no more, till you &s;hall know how to value the comfort and happine&s;s of your future life at more than 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year: Till then, the re&s;pect I pay to my mother's brother, and the regard I have for his ho|nour, will make me chearfully pay the 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year in di&s;pute, out of my own pocket.</P>

as well in ju&s;tice to him, as to &s;ave him the pain of attending to an affair that mu&s;t be grievous to him: And I in&s;i&s;ted upon giving him an acknowlegement under my hand, for that &s;um; and to be accountable to him for it, as his banker would in the like ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And thus ended this affair. The woman went away before me. She begged the favour, at the door, of one word with me. My Lord &s;tarted up, at her voice: His complexion varied: He whipt as nimbly be|hind the door, as if he had no gout in his foot. I will not &s;ee her, &s;aid he.</P>
<P>I &s;tepped out. She complimented, thanked me, and wept; but, in the height of her concern, would have uttered bitter things again&s;t my Lord: But I &s;topped her mouth, by telling her, that I was to be her payma&s;ter, quarterly, of the 250 <HI>l.</HI> a year. She turned her execrations, again&s;t her Lord, into ble&s;&s;ings on me: But, after all, departed with reluctance.</P>
<P>Pride, and not tenderne&s;s, was vi&s;ibly the occa&s;ion. Could &s;he have &s;ecured her whole annuity, &s;he would have gratified that pride, by leaving her Lord in tri|umph while &s;he thought her departure would have given him regret: But to be <HI>di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,</HI> was a di&s;grace that affected her, and gave bitterne&s;s to her in&s;olent &s;pirit.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XI.</HI> Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON,</HI> To Dr. <HI>BARTLETT.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>MY Lord, tho' he had acquitted him&s;elf on the occa&s;ion, in &s;uch a manner as darted into my mind a little ray of my beloved mother's &s;pirit, could not forbear giving way to his habitual littlene&s;s, when he was a&s;&s;ured Giffard was out of the hou&s;e. He called Halden to him, who entered with joy in his counte|nance, ari&s;ing, as it came out, from the &s;ame occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="82" REF="85">
and ordered him to make all his dome&s;tics happy for (what he meanly called) his <HI>deliverance:</HI> A&s;king, If there were any-body in the hou&s;e who loved her? Not a &s;ingle &s;oul, &s;aid Halden; and I am &s;ure, that I may venture to congratulate your Lord&s;hip, in the names of all your &s;ervants: For &s;he was proud, im|perious, and indeed a tyranne&s;s to all beneath her.</P>
<P>I then, for the fir&s;t time, pitied the woman; and &s;hould have pitied her &s;till more (true as this might, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be) had &s;he not gone away &s;o amply rewarded: For in this little family I looked forward to the family of the State; the Sovereign and his mi|ni&s;ters. How often has a mini&s;ter, who has made a tyrannical u&s;e of his power (and even &s;ome who have not) experienced, on his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, the like treatment, from tho&s;e who, had they had his power, would per|haps have made as bad u&s;e of it; who, in its pleni|tude, were &s;awning, creeping &s;laves, as the&s;e &s;er|vants might be to this mi&s;tre&s;s of their Lord! We read but of one grateful Cromwell, in all the &s;uperb train of Wol&s;ey, when he had fallen into di&s;grace; and yet he had in it hundreds, &s;ome not ignobly born, and all of them le&s;s meanly de&s;cended than their mag|nificent ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Halden addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, as having been the means of making his Lord, and his whole hou&s;hold, happy. Let the joy be moderate, Halden, &s;aid I: The poor woman might, po&s;&s;ibly, have numbered among her well-wi&s;hers (&s;he could not have di&s;obliged <HI>every</HI> -body) &s;ome of tho&s;e, who now will be mo&s;t forward to load her with obloquy. You mu&s;t not make her too con&s;iderable: It is be&s;t for my Lord, as well as for tho&s;e who loved her not, to forget there ever was &s;uch a woman; except to avoid her faults, and to imitate her in what was commendable. She boa&s;ts of her hone&s;ty and management: My Lord charges her not with infidelity, of any kind.</P>
<P>Halden bowed, and withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">
My Lord &s;wore, by his &s;oul, that I had not my good name for nothing. Ble&s;&s;ed, &s;aid he, be the name of the Grandi&s;ons! This la&s;t plaudit gratified my pride (I need not tell my Dr. Bartlett, that I have pride); the more gratified it, as Lord W.'s animo&s;ity to my father made him out of love with his name.</P>
<P>I did not think, when my Lord began his &s;tory to me, that I &s;hould &s;o &s;oon have brought about a &s;epa|ration of guilt from guilt: But their matual di&s;gu&s;ts had prepared the way; re&s;entment and pride, ming|led with avarice on one &s;ide, and &s;elf-intere&s;tedne&s;s, founded (rea&s;onably) on a &s;tipulation made, and not complied with, on the other; were all that hindred it from taking place as from them&s;elves. A mediator had nothing then to do, but to advi&s;e an act of ju&s;tice, and &s;o to gild it by a precedent of di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s in him&s;elf, as &s;hould in&s;pire an emulation in a proud &s;pi|rit, that, if not then, mu&s;t, when pa&s;&s;ion had &s;ub&s;ided, have ari&s;en, to make all end as it ought.</P>
<P>When I found my Lord's joy a little moderated, I drew my chair near him. Well, my Lord, and now as to your hints of marriage&mdash;</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed God!&mdash;Why, nephew, you <HI>overturn</HI> me with your genero&s;ity. Are you not my next of kin? And can you give your con&s;ent, were I to a&s;k it, that I &s;hould marry?</P>
<P>I give you not only my <HI>con&s;ent,</HI> as you conde&s;cend|ingly phra&s;e it, but my <HI>advice,</HI> to marry.</P>
<P>Good God! <HI>I</HI> could not, in the like ca&s;e, do thus. But, nephew, I am not a young man.</P>
<P>The more need of a prudent, a di&s;creet, a tender a&s;&s;i&s;tant. Your Lord&s;hip hinted, that you liked not men-&s;ervants about your per&s;on, in your illne&s;s. You are often indi&s;po&s;ed with the gout: Servants will not always <HI>be</HI> &s;ervants when they find them&s;elves of u&s;e. Infirmity requires indulgence: In the very nature of the word and thing, indulgence cannot exi&s;t with &s;er|vility; between man and wife it may: The &s;ame in|tere&s;t
<PB N="84" REF="87">
unites them. Mutual confidence! who can enough value the joy, the tranquillity at lea&s;t, that re&s;ults from mutual confidence? A man gives his own con&s;equence to the woman he marries; and he &s;ees him&s;elf re&s;pected in the re&s;pect paid her: She extends his dignity, and confirms it. There is &s;uch a tender|ne&s;s, &s;uch an helpfulne&s;s, &s;uch a &s;ympathy in &s;uffer|ing, in a good woman, that I am always for excu&s;ing men in years, who marry prudently; while I cen&s;ure, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, women in years. Male nur&s;es are unnatural creatures! [There is not &s;uch a cha|racter that can be re&s;pectable] Womens &s;phere is the hou&s;e, and their &s;hining-place the &s;ick chamber, in which they can exert all their amiable, and, &s;hall I &s;ay, lenient qualities? Marry, my-Lord, by all means. You are hardly Fifty; but were you Se|venty, and &s;o often indi&s;po&s;ed; &s;o wealthy; no chil|dren to repine at a mother-in-law, and to render your life or hers uncomfortable by their little jealou&s;ies; I would advi&s;e you to marry. The man or woman de|&s;erves not to be benefited in the di&s;po&s;ition of your affairs, that would wi&s;h you to continue in the hands of mean people, and to rob you of the joys of confi|dence, and the comfort of tender help, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rom an equal, or from one who de&s;erves to be made your equal, in degree. Only, my Lord, marry &s;o, as not to defeat your own end: Marry not a gay creature, who will be &s;luttering about in public, while you are groaning in your chamber, and wi&s;hing for her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ings on your heart, my nephew! Be&s;t of men! I can bold no longer. There was no bearing, <HI>before,</HI> your genero&s;ity: What can I &s;ay now?&mdash;But you mu&s;t be in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>Have you, my Lord, a&s;ked I, any Lady in your eye?</P>
<P>No, &s;aid he; indeed I have not.</P>
<P>I was the better plea&s;ed with him, that he had not; becau&s;e I was afraid, that, like our VIIIth Henry, he
<PB N="85" REF="88">
had &s;ome other woman in view, which might have made him more unea&s;y than he would otherwi&s;e have been with Giffard: For tho' it was better that he &s;hould marry, than live in &s;candal; and a woman of untainted character, rather than one who had let the world &s;ee that &s;he could take a price for her honour; yet I thought him better ju&s;tified in his complaints of that woman's mi&s;behaviour, than in the other ca&s;e he would have been: And that it was an happine&s;s to both (if a right u&s;e were made of the event) that they had been unable to live on, as they had &s;et out.</P>
<P>He told me, that he &s;hould think him&s;elf the hap|pie&s;t of men, if I could find out, and recommend to him, a woman, that I thought worthy of his addre&s;|&s;es; and even would court her for him.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip ought not to expect fortune.</P>
<P>I do not.</P>
<P>She &s;hould be a gentlewoman by birth and edu|cation; a woman of a &s;erious turn: Such an one is not likely in affluence to run into tho&s;e &s;cenes of life, from which, perhaps, only want of fortune has re|&s;trained the gayer creature. I would not have your Lord&s;hip fix an age, tho' I think you &s;hould not marry a girl. Some women, at Thirty, are more di&s;creet than others at Forty: And if your Lord&s;hip &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed with a child or two to inherit your great e&s;tate, that happy event would dome&s;ticate the Lady, and make your latter years more happy than your former.</P>
<P>My Lord held up his hands and eyes, and tears &s;eemed to make them&s;elves &s;urrows on his cheeks.</P>
<P>He made me look at him, by what he &s;aid on this occa&s;ion, and with anger, till he explained him&s;elf.</P>
<P>By my &s;oul, &s;aid he, and clapped his two lifted-up hands together, I have your father: I never heartily loved him; but now I hate him more than ever I did in my life.</P>
<P>My Lord!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="89">
Don't be &s;urpri&s;ed. I hate him for keeping &s;o long abroad a &s;on, who would have converted us both. Le&s;&s;ons of morality, given in &s;o noble a manner by regular <HI>practice,</HI> rather than by preaching <HI>theory</HI> (tho&s;e were his words) not only where there is no in|tere&s;t propo&s;ed to be &s;erved, but <HI>again&s;t</HI> intere&s;t, mu&s;t have &s;ubdued us both; and that by our own con|&s;ents. O my &s;i&s;ter! and he cla&s;ped his hands, and lifted up his eyes, as if he had the dear object of his brotherly addre&s;s before him; how have you ble&s;&s;ed me, in your &s;on!&mdash;</P>
<P>This apo&s;trophe to my mother affected me. What a mixture is there in the character of Lord W.! What a good man might he have made, had he been later his own ma&s;ter!&mdash;His father died before he was of age.</P>
<P>He declared, that I had de&s;cribed the very wife he wi&s;hed to have. Find out &s;uch an one for me, my dear kin&s;man, &s;aid he; and I give you <HI>charte blanche:</HI> But let her not be younger than Fifty. Make the &s;ettlements for me: I am very rich: I will &s;ign them blind&s;old. If the Lady be &s;uch an one as <HI>you</HI> &s;ay I <HI>ought</HI> to love, I <HI>will</HI> love her: Only let her &s;ay, &s;he can be grateful for my love, and for the provi&s;ion you &s;hall direct me to make for her; and my fir&s;t in|terview with her &s;hall be at the altar.</P>
<P>I think, my friend, I have in my eye &s;uch a woman as my Lord ought to do very hand&s;ome things for, if &s;he conde&s;cend to have him. I will not tell you, not even <HI>you,</HI> whom I mean, till I know &s;he will encou|rage &s;uch a propo&s;al; and, for her own fortune's &s;ake, I think &s;he &s;hould: But I had her not in my thoughts when I propo&s;ed to my Lord the character of the woman he &s;hould wi&s;h for.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, Mar. <HI>21.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DR. Bartlett went to town ye&s;terday. He returned early enough to breakfa&s;t with us. He found at dinner with his patron, the whole Danby family and Mr. Sylve&s;ter; as al&s;o, the two ma&s;ters of the young gentlemen, with Mr. Galliard, who&s;e &s;on is in love with Mi&s;s Danby, and &s;he with him. There all the parties had confirmed to them the generous good|ne&s;s of Sir Charle&s;s, of which he had a&s;&s;ured Mr. Syl|ve&s;ter and the two brothers and &s;i&s;ter before.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, methinks, the doctor went to town: We &s;hould otherwi&s;e, perhaps, have had the parti|culars of all, from the pen of the benevolent man. Such joy, &s;uch admiration, &s;uch gratitude, the doctor &s;ays, were expre&s;&s;ed from every mouth, that his own eyes, as well as Mr. Sylve&s;ter's, and mo&s;t of tho&s;e pre&s;ent, more than once, were ready to overflow.</P>
<P>Every thing was there &s;ettled, and even a match propo&s;ed by Sir Charles, and the propo&s;al received with approbation on both &s;ides, between the elder Mi&s;s Galliard, and that audacious young man the drug-merchant; who recovered, by his behaviour in this meeting, his reputation with Sir Charles, and e|very-body.</P>
<P>The doctor &s;ays, that Mr. Hervey and Mr. Pou&s;&s;in, the two ma&s;ters of the young gentlemen, are very worthy men; &s;o is Mr. Galliard: And they behaved &s;o hand&s;omely on the occa&s;ion, that Sir Charles ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf highly plea&s;ed with them all. For Mr. Hervey and Mr. Galliard offered to accept of le&s;s money than Sir Charles made the young people worth; the one for a portion with Mi&s;s Danby; the other for
<PB N="88" REF="91">
admitting the elder Danby into a partner&s;hip with him, on his marriage with his niece: But Sir Charles had no notion, he &s;aid, of putting young men, of good characters and abilities, to difficulties at their en|trance into the world: The greate&s;t expences, he ob|&s;erved, were then incurred. In &s;light or &s;canty be|ginnings, &s;canty plans mu&s;t be laid, and pur&s;ued. Mr. Galliard then declared, that the younger Danby &s;hould have the hand&s;omer fortune with his daughter, if &s;he approved of him, for the very hand&s;ome one Mi&s;s Danby would carry to his &s;on.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's example, in &s;hort, fired every one with emulation; and three marriages, with the happie&s;t pro&s;pects, are likely very &s;oon to follow the&s;e noble in&s;tances of genero&s;ity. Mr. Sylve&s;ter propo&s;ed the celebration on one day: In that ca&s;e, the gentlemen joined to hope Sir Charles would honour them with his pre&s;ence. He a&s;&s;entingly bowed. How many families are here, at once made happy!</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, after he had given us this relation, &s;aid, on our joining in one general ble&s;&s;ing of his pa|tron, You know not, Ladies, you know not, my Lord, what a general <HI>Philanthropi&s;t</HI> your brother is: His whole delight is in doing good. It has always been &s;o: And to mend the hearts, as well as fortunes, of men, is his glory.</P>
<P>We could not but congratulate the doctor on his having &s;o con&s;iderable a hand (as Sir Charles always, Lord L. &s;aid, delighted to own) in cultivating his innate good principles, at &s;o critical a time of life, as that was, in which they became acquainted.</P>
<P>The doctor very mode&s;ty received the compli|ment, and, to wave our prai&s;es, gave us another in|&s;tance of the great manner in which Sir Charles con|ferred benefits, as follows:</P>
<P>He once, &s;aid the doctor, when his fortune was not what it now is, lent a very hone&s;t man, a merchant of Leghorn, when he re&s;ided there (as he did &s;ome|times
<PB N="89" REF="92">
for a month or two together, for the conveniency of the Engli&s;h chapel) a con&s;iderable &s;um; and took his bond for it: After a while, things not an&s;wering to the poor man's expectation, Mr. Grandi&s;on took notice to me, &s;aid the doctor, that he appeared greatly depre&s;&s;ed and dejected, and occa&s;ionally came into his company with &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of obligation in his coun|tenance and behaviour, that he could not bear it: And why, &s;aid he, &s;hould I keep it in my power to di&s;tre&s;s a man, who&s;e mode&s;ty and diffidence &s;hew, that he de&s;erves to be made ea&s;y?&mdash;I may die &s;udden|ly: My executors may think it but ju&s;tice to exact payment: And that exaction may involve him in as great difficulties as tho&s;e were, from which the loan delivered him.&mdash;I will make his heart light. In&s;tead of &s;uffering him to &s;igh over his uncertain pro&s;pects at his board, or in his bed, I will make both his board and his bed ea&s;y to him. His wife and his five children &s;hall rejoice with him; they &s;hall &s;ee the good man's countenance, as it u&s;ed to do, &s;hine upon them; and occa&s;ionally meet mine with grateful comfort.</P>
<P>He then cancelled the bond: And, at the &s;ame time, fearing the man's di&s;tre&s;s might be deeper than he owned, offered him the loan of a further &s;um. But, by his behaviour upon it, I found, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on, that the &s;um he owed, and the doubt he had of being able to pay it in time, were the whole of the hone&s;t man's grievance. He declined, with gratitude, the additional offer, and walked, ever after, erect.</P>
<P>He is now living, and happy, proceeded the doc|tor; and, ju&s;t before Mr. Grandi&s;on left Italy, would have made him &s;ome part of payment, from the hap|pier turn in his affairs; which, probably, was owing to his revived &s;pirits. But Mr. Grandi&s;on a&s;ked, What he thought he meant, when he cancelled the o|bligation?&mdash;Yet he told him, that it was not wrong in him to make the tender: For free minds, he &s;aid, loved not to be ungenerou&s;ly dealt with.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93">
What a man is this, Lucy!</P>
<P>No wonder, thus gloriou&s;ly employed, with my Lord W. and the Danby's, &s;aid Lord L. and perhaps in other acts of goodne&s;s that we know nothing of, be|&s;ides the duties of his executor&s;hip, that we are de|prived of his company! But <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the&s;e, as he has &s;o good a friend as Dr. Bartlett, he might transfer to him&mdash;and oblige us more with his pre&s;ence; and the rather, as he declares it would be obliging him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ah, my Lord! &s;aid the doctor, and looked round him, his eyes dwelling longe&s;t on me&mdash;You don't know&mdash;He &s;topped. We all were &s;ilent. He pro|ceeded&mdash;Sir Charles Grandi&s;on does nothing without rea&s;on: A good man mu&s;t have difficulties to encoun|ter with, that a meer man of the world would not be embarra&s;&s;ed by.&mdash;But how I engage your attention, Ladies!&mdash;</P>
<P>The doctor aro&s;e; for breakfa&s;t was over&mdash;Dear doctor, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, don't leave us&mdash;As to that Bologna, that Camilla, that Bi&s;hop&mdash;Tell us more of them, dear doctor.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Ladies; excu&s;e me, my Lord. He bowed, and withdrew.</P>
<P>How we looked at one another! How the fool, in particular, blu&s;hed! How her heart throbbed!&mdash;At what?&mdash;</P>
<P>But, Lucy, give me your opinion&mdash;Dr. Bartlett gue&s;&s;es, that I am far from being indifferent to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on: He mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ured, that my own heart mu&s;t be ab&s;olutely void of <HI>benevolence,</HI> if I did not more and more e&s;teem Sir Charles, for <HI>his:</HI> And would Dr. Bartlett be &s;o cruel, as to contribute to a flame, that, perhaps, is with difficulty kept from blazing out, as one hears new in&s;tances of his ge|nerous goodne&s;s, if he <HI>knew</HI> that Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on was &s;o engaged, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;What &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;O this cruel, cruel &s;u&s;pen&s;e&mdash;What hopes, what fears, what contradictory con|jectures!
<PB N="91" REF="94">
&mdash;But all will too &s;oon perhaps&mdash;Here he is come&mdash;Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is come&mdash;</P>
<P>O no!&mdash;A fal&s;e alarm!&mdash;He is <HI>not</HI> come: It is only my Lord L. returned from an airing.</P>
<P>I could beat this girl! this Emily!&mdash;It was owing to her!&mdash;A chit!&mdash;How we have fluttered each other!&mdash;But &s;end for me down to Northampton&s;hire, my dear friends, before I am quite a fool.</P>
<P>PRAY&mdash;Do you know, Lucy, What is the bu&s;ine&s;s that calls Mr. Deane to town, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year? He has made a vi&s;it to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on: For Dr. Bartlett told me, as a grateful compliment, that Sir Charles was much plea&s;ed with him; yet Mr. Deane did not tell <HI>me,</HI> that he de&s;igned it. I be&s;eech you, my dear friends&mdash;Do not&mdash;But you would not; you <HI>could</HI> not!&mdash;I would be torn in pieces: I would not accept of&mdash;I don't know what I would &s;ay. Only add not di&s;grace to di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;But I am &s;afe, if nothing be done but at the motion of my grandmamma and aunt Selby. They would not per|mit Mr. Deane, or any-body, to make <HI>improper</HI> vi|&s;its.&mdash;But don't you think, that it mu&s;t look parti|cular to Sir Charles, to have a vi&s;it paid him by a man expre&s;&s;ing for me &s;o much unde&s;erved tenderne&s;s and affection, &s;o long after the affair was over which afforded him a motive for it?&mdash;I dread, as much for Mr. Dean's &s;ake as my own, every-thing that may be con&s;trued into officiou&s;ne&s;s or particularity, by &s;o nice a di&s;cerner. Does he not &s;ay, that no man is more quick-&s;ighted than him&s;elf, to tho&s;e &s;aults in women which are owing to want of delicacy?</P>
<P>I have been very earne&s;t with Lord and Lady L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, that they do not &s;uffer their friend&s;hip for me to lay me under any difficulties with their brother. They all took my meaning, and pro|mi&s;ed to con&s;ult my punctilio, as well as my incli|nation. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on was more kindly in earne&s;t,

in her a&s;&s;urances of this nature, than I was afraid &s;he would be: And my Lord &s;aid, It was fit that I &s;hould find even nicene&s;s gratified, in this particular.</P>
<P>[I ab&s;olutely confide in you, Lucy, to place hooks where I forget to put them; and where, in your de|licate mind, you think I <HI>ought</HI> to put them; that they may direct your eye (when you come to read out be|fore my uncle) to omit tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which very few men have delicacy or &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s enough to be tru&s;ted with.

<P>I AM very much di&s;&s;atisfied with my&s;elf, my dear Dr. Bartlett. What pains have I taken, to con|quer tho&s;e &s;udden gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, to which, from my early youth, I have been &s;ubject, as you have often heard me confe&s;s! yet to find, at times, that I am unequal&mdash;to my&s;elf, &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;To <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> I <HI>will</HI> &s;ay; &s;ince I have been &s;o much amended by your pre|cepts, and example. But I will give you the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>My gue&s;ts, and you, had but ju&s;t left me, when the wretched Jervois, and her O Hara, and another bullying man, de&s;ired to &s;peak with me.</P>
<P>I bid the &s;ervant &s;hew the woman into the drawing|room next my &s;tudy, and the men into the adjoining parlour; but they both followed her into the draw|ing room. I went to her, and, after a little &s;tiff ci|vility (I could not help it) a&s;ked, If the&s;e gentlemen had bu&s;ine&s;s with me?</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="96">
That gentleman is Major O-Hara, Sir: He is my hu&s;band. That gentleman is Captain Salmonet: He is the Major's brother-in-law. He is an officer, of equal worth and bravery.</P>
<P>They gave them&s;elves airs of importance and fa|miliarity; and the Major motioned, as if he would have taken my hand.</P>
<P>I encouraged not the motion. Will you, gentle|men, walk this way?</P>
<P>I led the way to my &s;tudy. The woman aro&s;e, and would have come with them.</P>
<P>If you plea&s;e to &s;tay where you are, madam, I will attend you pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>They entered; and, as if they would have me think them connoi&s;&s;eurs, began to admire the globes, the orrery, the pictures, and bu&s;ts.</P>
<P>I took off that &s;ort of attention&mdash;Pray, gentlemen, what are your commands with me?</P>
<P>I am called Major O-Hara, Sir: I am the hu&s;band of the Lady in the next room, as &s;he told you.</P>
<P>And what, pray, Sir, have I to do, either with you, or your marriage? I pay that Lady, as the widow of Mr. Jervois, 200<HI>l.</HI> a year: I am not obliged to pay her more then one. She has no demands upon me; much le&s;s has her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>The men had &s;o much the air of bullies, and the woman is &s;o very wicked, that my departed friend, and the name by which &s;he &s;o lately called the poor Emily, were in my head, and I had too little com|mand of my temper.</P>
<P>Look ye, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, I would have you to know&mdash;</P>
<P>And he put his left hand upon his &s;word-handle, pre&s;&s;ing it down, which tilted up the point with an air extremely in&s;olent.</P>
<P>What am I to under&s;tand by that motion, Sir?</P>
<P>Nothing at all, Sir Charles&mdash;D-n me, if I mean any thing by it&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97">
You are called <HI>Major,</HI> you &s;ay, Sir&mdash;Do you bear the king's commi&s;&s;ion, Sir?</P>
<P>I <HI>have</HI> borne it, Sir, if I do not now.</P>
<P>That, and the hou&s;e you are in, give you a title to civility. But, Sir, I cannot allow, that your mar|riage with the Lady in the next room gives you pre|tence to bu&s;ine&s;s with me. If you have, on any other account, pray let me know what it is?</P>
<P>The man &s;eemed at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay; but not from ba&s;hfulne&s;s. He looked about him, as if for his woman; &s;et his teeth; bit his lip; and took &s;nuff, with an air &s;o like defiance, that, for fear I &s;hould not be able to forbear taking notice of it, I turned to the other: Pray, Captain Salmonet, &s;aid I, what are <HI>your</HI> commands with me?</P>
<P>He &s;poke in broken Engli&s;h; and &s;aid, He had the honour to be Major O-Hara's brother: He had mar|ried the Major's &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>And why, Sir, might you not have favoured me with the company of all your relations?&mdash;Have you any bu&s;ine&s;s with me, Sir, on your own account?</P>
<P>I come, I come, &s;aid he, to &s;ee my brother righted, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Who has wronged him?&mdash;Take care, gentlemen, how&mdash;But Mr. O-Hara, what are your preten&s;ions?</P>
<P>Why look-ye, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on (throwing open his coat, and &s;ticking one hand in his &s;ide, the other thrown out with a flouri&s;h) Look-ye, Sir, re|peated he&mdash;</P>
<P>I found my choler ri&s;ing. I was afraid of my &s;elf.</P>
<P>When I treat <HI>you</HI> familiarly, Sir, then treat <HI>me</HI> &s;o: Till when, plea&s;e to withdraw&mdash;</P>
<P>I rang: Frederick came in.</P>
<P>Shew the&s;e gentleman into the little parlour&mdash;You will excu&s;e me, Sirs; I attend the Lady.</P>
<P>They muttered, and gave them&s;elves bri&s;k and angry airs; nodding their heads at each other; but followed the &s;ervant into that parlour.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="98">
I went to Mrs. O-Hara, as &s;he calls her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Well, madam, what is your bu&s;ine&s;s with me, <HI>now?</HI></P>
<P>Where are the gentlemen, Sir? Where is my hu&s;band?</P>
<P>They are both in the next room, and within hear|ing of all that &s;hall pa&s;s between you and me.</P>
<P>And do you hold them unworthy of your pre&s;ence, Sir?</P>
<P>Not, madam, while <HI>you</HI> are before me, and if they had any bu&s;ine&s;s with me, or I with them.</P>
<P>Has not an hu&s;band bu&s;ine&s;s where his wife is?</P>
<P>Neither wife nor hu&s;band has bu&s;ine&s;s with me.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, I am come to demand my daughter. I come to demand a mother's right.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer not to &s;uch a demand: You know you have no right to make it.</P>
<P>I have been at Colnebrooke: She was kept from me: My child was carried out of the hou&s;e, that I might not &s;ee her.</P>
<P>And have you then terrified the poor girl?</P>
<P>I have left a Letter for her; and I expect to &s;ee her upon it.&mdash;Her new father, as worthy and as brave a man as your&s;elf, Sir, longs to &s;ee her&mdash;</P>
<P>Her <HI>new father!</HI> madam&mdash;You <HI>expect to &s;ee her!</HI> madam&mdash;What was your behaviour to her? unna|tural woman! the la&s;t time you &s;aw her? But if you do &s;ee her, it mu&s;t be in my pre&s;ence, and without your man, if he form preten&s;ions, on your account, that may give either her or me di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>You are only, Sir, to take care of her fortune; &s;o I am advi&s;ed: I, as her mother, have the natural right over her per&s;on. The Chancery will give it to me.</P>
<P>Then &s;eek your remedy in Chancery: Let me never hear of you again, but by the officers of that cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>I opened the door leading into the room where the two men were.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="99">
They are not officers, I dare &s;ay: Common men of the town, I doubt not, new-dre&s;&s;ed for the oc|ca&s;ion. O-Hara, as &s;he calls him, is, probably, one of her temporary hu&s;bands, only.</P>
<P>Pray walk in, gentlemen, &s;aid I. This Lady inti|mates to me, that &s;he will apply to Chancery again&s;t me. The Chancery, if &s;he have any grievance, will be a proper <HI>recour&s;e.</HI> She can have no bu&s;ine&s;s with me, after &s;uch a declaration&mdash;Much le&s;s can either of you.</P>
<P>And opening the drawing-room door that led to the hall, Frederick, &s;aid I, attend the lady and the gen|tlemen to their coach.</P>
<P>And I turned from them, to go into my &s;tudy.</P>
<P>The Major, as he was called, a&s;ked me, with a fierce air, his hand on his &s;word, If this were treat|ment due to gentlemen?</P>
<P>This hou&s;e, in which, however, you are an in|truder, Sir, is your protection; or that motion, and that air, if you mean any-thing by either, would co&s;t you dear.</P>
<P>I am, Sir, the protector of my wife: You have in|&s;ulted her, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>Have I in&s;ulted your wife, Sir?&mdash;And I &s;tepped up to him; but ju&s;t in time recovered my&s;elf, remem|bering where I was&mdash;Take care, Sir&mdash;But you are &s;afe, here.&mdash;Frederick, wait upon the gentlemen to the door&mdash;</P>
<P>Frederick was not in hearing: The well-meaning man, apprehending con&s;equences, went, it &s;eems, into the offices, to get together &s;ome of his fellow-&s;er|&s;ants.</P>
<P>Salmonet, putting him&s;elf into violent motion&punc; &s;wore, that he would &s;tand by his friend, his brother&punc; to the la&s;t drop of his blood; and, in a po&s;ture of offence, drew his &s;word half way.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, friend, &s;aid I, (but could hardly contain my&s;elf) that I were in <HI>your</HI> hou&s;e, in&s;tead of your
<PB N="97" REF="100">
being in <HI>mine.</HI> &mdash;But if you would have your &s;word broken over your head, draw it quite.</P>
<P>He did, with a vapour. D&mdash;n him, he &s;aid, if he bore that! My <HI>own</HI> hou&s;e, on &s;uch an in&s;ult as this, &s;hould not be my protection; and, retreating, he put him&s;elf into a po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P><HI>Now,</HI> Major! <HI>Now,</HI> Major! &s;aid the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ked woman.</P>
<P>Her Major al&s;o drew, making wretched grimaces.</P>
<P>I was dre&s;&s;ed. I knew not but the men were a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ins. I drew, put by Salmonet's &s;word, clo&s;ed with him, di&s;armed him, and, by the &s;ame effort, laid him on the floor.</P>
<P>O-Hara, &s;kipping about, as if he watched for an opportunity to make a pu&s;h with &s;afety to him&s;elf, lo&s;t his &s;word, by the u&s;ual trick whereby a man, any|thing &s;killed in his weapons, knows how &s;ometimes to di&s;arm a <HI>le&s;s</HI> &s;kilful adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>The woman &s;creamed, and ran into the hall.</P>
<P>I turned the two men, fir&s;t one, then the other, out of the room, with a contempt that they de&s;erved; and Frederick, Richard, and Jerry, who, by that time, were got together in the hall, a little too roughly perhaps, turned them into the Square.</P>
<P>They limped into the coach they came in: The woman, in terror, was already in it. When they were al&s;o in it, they cur&s;ed, &s;wore, and threatened.</P>
<P>The pretended Captain, putting his body half-way out of the coach, bid my &s;ervants tell me, That I was&mdash;That I was&mdash;And avoiding a wor&s;e name, as it &s;eemed <HI>No Gentleman;</HI> and that he would find an opportunity to make me repent the treatment I had given to men of honour, and to a Lady.</P>
<P>The Major, in eagerne&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething, by way of re&s;entment and menace likewi&s;e&mdash;(beginning with damning his blood)&mdash;had his intended threatening cut &s;hort, by meeting the Captain's head with his, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">he other, in a rage, withdrew it, after his &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ech to the
<PB N="98" REF="101">
&s;ervant: And each cur&s;ing the other, one rubbing his forehead, the other putting his hand to his head, away drove the coach.</P>
<P>They forgot to a&s;k for their &s;words; and one of them left his hat behind him.</P>
<P>You cannot imagine, my dear Dr. Bartlett, how much this idle affair has di&s;turbed me: I cannot for|give my&s;elf&mdash;To &s;uffer my&s;elf to be provoked by two &s;uch men, to violate the &s;anction of my own hou&s;e! Yet they came, no doubt, to bully and provoke me; or to lay a foundation for a demand, that they knew, if per&s;onally made, mu&s;t do it.</P>
<P>My only excu&s;e to my&s;elf is, That there were two of them; and that, tho' I drew, yet I had the com|mand of my&s;elf &s;o far as only to defend my&s;elf, when I might have done any thing with them. I have ge|nerally found, that tho&s;e who are the readie&s;t to give offence, are the unfitte&s;t, when brought to the te&s;t, to &s;upport their own in&s;olence.</P>
<P>But my Emily! my poor Emily! How mu&s;t &s;he be terrified!&mdash;I will be with you very &s;oon. Let not her know any-thing of this idle affair; nor any-body but Lord L.</P>

<P>I HAVE ju&s;t parted with one Blagrave, an attorney, who already had been ordered to proceed again&s;t me: But, out of regand to my character, and having, as he owned&punc; no great opinion of his clients, he thought fit to come to me in per&s;on, to acquaint me of it, and to inform him&s;elf, from me, of the whole affair.</P>
<P>The gentleman's civility intitled him to expect an account of it: I gave it him.</P>
<P>He told me, That if I plea&s;ed to re&s;tore the &s;words and the hat, by him&punc; and would promi&s;e not to &s;top the future quarterly payments of the 200 <HI>l.</HI> a year, about which they were very apprehen&s;ive; he dared to &s;ay, that, after &s;uch an exertion of &s;pirit, as he called a choleric exce&s;s, I &s;hould not hear any more
<PB N="99" REF="102">
of them for one while; &s;ince, he believed, they had only been trying an experiment; which had been car|ried farther, he dared to &s;ay, than they had de&s;igned it &s;hould.</P>
<P>He hinted his opinion, that the men were common men of the town; and that they had never been ho|noured with commi&s;&s;ions in any &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The woman (I know not by what name to call her, &s;ince it is very probable, that &s;he has not a real title to that of O-Hara) was taken out of the coach in violent hy&s;terics, as O-Hara told him; who, in con&s;ulting Mr. Blagrave, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to aggravate matters, in order to lay a foundation for an action of damages.</P>
<P>She accu&s;ed the men of cowardice, before Mr. Bla|grave; and that in very opprobrious terms.</P>
<P>They excu&s;ed them&s;elves, as being loth to hurt me; which, they &s;aid, they ea&s;ily could have done; e&s;pecially before I drew.</P>
<P>They both pretended, to Mr. Blagrave, per&s;onal damages; but I hope their hurts are magnified.</P>
<P>I am (however that be) <HI>mo&s;t</HI> hurt; for I am not at all plea&s;ed with my&s;elf. They, po&s;&s;ibly, tho' they have no cau&s;e to be &s;atisfied with their parts in the &s;ray, have been more accu&s;tomed to &s;uch &s;cuf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">les, than I; and are above, or rather beneath, all pun|ctilio.</P>
<P>Mr. Blagrave took the &s;words and the hat with him in the coach that waited for him.</P>
<P>If I thought it would not have looked like a com|promi&s;e, and encouraged their in&s;olence, I co ld freely have &s;ent them <HI>more</HI> than what belonged to hem. I am really greatly hurt by the part I acted to &s;uch men.</P>
<P>As to the annuity; I bid Mr. Blagrave tell the woman, that the payment of that, depended upon her future good behaviour; and yet, that I was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ure, that &s;he was intitled to it, but as the <HI>widow</HI> of my friend.</P>
<P>However, I told this gentleman, That no provo|cation
<PB N="100" REF="103">
&s;hould hinder me from doing &s;trict ju&s;tice, tho' I were &s;ure that they would go to law with the money I &s;hould cau&s;e to be paid to them quarterly. You will therefore know, Sir, added I, that the fund which they have to depend upon, to &s;upport a law-&s;uit, &s;hould they commence one, and think fit to employ in it &s;o hone&s;t a man as you &s;eem to be, is 100 <HI>l.</HI> a year. It would be madne&s;s, if not inju&s;tice, to pay the other 100 <HI>l.</HI> for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, when it was left to my di&s;cretion to pay it, or not, with a view to di&s;|courage that litigious &s;pirit which is one, of an hun|dred, of this poor woman's bad qualities.</P>
<P>And thus, for the pre&s;ent, &s;tands this affair. I look upon my trouble from this woman as over, till &s;ome new &s;cheme ari&s;es, either among the&s;e people, or from others whom &s;he may con&s;ult or employ. You and I, when I have the happine&s;s to attend you and my other friends, will not renew the &s;ubject.</P>

<P>SIR Charles arrived this morning, ju&s;t as we had a&s;&s;embled to breakfa&s;t; for Lady L. is not an early ri&s;er. The moment he entered, &s;un&s;hine broke out in the countenance of every one.</P>
<P>He apologized to all, but me, for his long ab&s;ence, e&s;pecially when they had <HI>&s;uch</HI> a gue&s;t, were his words, bowing to me; and I thought he &s;ighed, and looked with tender regard upon me; but I dared not a&s;k Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on whether &s;he &s;aw any thing particular in his devoirs to me.</P>
<P>It was owing to his politene&s;s, I pre&s;ume, that he did not include me in his apologies; becau&s;e that
<PB N="101" REF="104">
would have been to &s;uppo&s;e, that I had <HI>expected</HI> him. Indeed I was not di&s;plea&s;ed, in the main, that he did not compliment me as a <HI>third</HI> &s;i&s;ter. See, Lucy, what little circum&s;tances a doubtful mind will &s;ometimes dwell upon.</P>
<P>I was not plea&s;ed that he had been &s;o long ab&s;ent, and had my thoughts to my&s;elf upon it; inclining once to have gone back to London; and perhaps &s;hould, could I have &s;an&s;ied my&s;elf of importance enough to make him unea&s;y by it [The &s;ex! the &s;ex! Lucy, will my uncle &s;ay; but I pretend not to be above its little foibles]: But the moment I &s;aw him, all my di&s;gu&s;ts were over. After the Ander&s;on, the Danby, the Lord W. affairs, he appeared to me in a much more &s;hining light than an hero would have done, returning in a triumphal car covered with lau|rels, and dragging captive princes at its wheels. How much more glorious a character is that of <HI>The Friend of Mankind,</HI> than that of <HI>The Conqueror of Nations!</HI></P>
<P>He told me, that he paid his compliments ye&s;terday to Mr. and Mrs. Reeves. He mentioned Mr. Deane's vi&s;it to him; and &s;aid very kind, but ju&s;t things in his prai&s;e. I read not any thing in his eyes, or manner, that gave me unea&s;ine&s;s on the vi&s;it that other good man made him.</P>
<P>My dear Emily &s;at generou&s;ly unea&s;y, I &s;aw, for the trouble &s;he had been the cau&s;e of giving to her be&s;t friend, tho' &s;he knew not of a vi&s;it, that her mother, and O-Hara, and Salmonet, made her guardian on Monday, as the doctor had hinted to us, without giv|ing us particulars.</P>
<P>Sir Charles thanked me for my goodne&s;s, as he called it, in getting the good girl &s;o happily out of her mother's way, as <HI>his</HI> Emily would have been too much terrified to &s;ee her: And he thanked Lord L. for his tenderne&s;s to his ward on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>My Lord gave him the Letter which Mrs. Jervois had left for her daughter. Sir Charles pre&s;ented it to
<PB N="102" REF="105">
the young Lady, without looking into it: She in&s;tantly returned it to him, in a very graceful manner. We will read it together by-and-by, my Emily, &s;aid he. Dr. Bartlett tells me, there is tenderne&s;s in it.</P>
<P>The doctor made apologies to him, for having communicated to us &s;ome of his Letters&mdash;Whatever Dr. Bartlett does, &s;aid Sir Charles, mu&s;t be right But what &s;ay my &s;i&s;ters to my propo&s;al of corre&s;pon|dence with them?</P>
<P>We &s;hould be glad, replied Lady L. to &s;ee all you write to Dr. Bartlett; but could not undertake to write you Letter for Letter.</P>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, has put us quite out of heart as to the talent of narrative Letter|writing.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be greatly honoured with a &s;ight of &s;uch Letters of Mi&s;s Byron as you, my Lord, have &s;een. Will Mi&s;s Byron, applying to me, favour <HI>one</HI> brother, and exclude <HI>another?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother!</HI> Lucy; I thought he was not at that time, quite &s;o hand&s;ome a man as when he fir&s;t entered the room.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent, and blu&s;hed. I knew not what an&s;wer to make; yet thought I &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething.</P>
<P>May we, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, hope for a peru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">al of your Letters to Dr. Bartlett for the &s;ame number of weeks pa&s;t, Letter for Letter, if we could prevail on Mi&s;s Byron to con&s;ent to the pro|po&s;al?</P>
<P>Would Mi&s;s Byron con&s;ent, upon that condition?</P>
<P>What &s;ay you, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid my Lord?</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, that I could not pre&s;ume to think, that the little chit-chat, which I wrote to plea&s;e my partial friends in the country, could appear tolerable in the eye of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>They all an&s;wered with high encomiums on my pen; and Sir Charles, in the mo&s;t re&s;pectful manner,
<PB N="103" REF="106">
in&s;i&s;ting upon not being denied to &s;ee what Lord L. had peru&s;ed; and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on having &s;aid that I had, to oblige them, been favoured with the return of my Letters from the country; I thought it would look like a too meaning particularity, if I refu&s;ed to oblige him, in the light (tho' not a very agreeable one, I own to you, Lucy) of <HI>another</HI> brother: I told him, that I would &s;hew him very willingly, and without condition, all the Letters I had written, of the narrative kind, from my fir&s;t coming to London, down to the dreadful ma&s;querade affair, and even Sir Har|grave's barbarous treatment of me, down to the deli|verance he had &s;o generou&s;ly given me.</P>
<P>How did he extol me, for what he called my noble frankne&s;s of heart! In that grace, he &s;aid, I excelled all the women he had ever conver&s;ed with. He a&s;&s;ured me, that he would not wi&s;h to &s;ee a line that I was not willing he &s;hould &s;ee; and that if he came to a word or pa&s;&s;age that he could &s;uppo&s;e would be of that nature, it &s;hould have no place in his memory.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on called out&mdash;But the <HI>condition,</HI> Sir Charles&mdash;</P>
<P>Is only this, replied I (I am &s;ure of your <HI>candor,</HI> Sir); that you will correct me, where I am wrong, in any of my notions or &s;entiments. I have been very pert and forward in &s;ome of my Letters; particularly, in a di&s;pute that was carried on in relation to Learning and Languages. If I could not, for <HI>improvement</HI> -&s;ake, more heartily be&s;peak your correction than your ap|probation, I &s;hould be afraid of your eye there.</P>
<P>Excellent Mi&s;s Byron! Beauty &s;hall not bribe me on your &s;ide, if I think you wrong in any point that you &s;ubmit to my judgment: And if I am Beauty-proof, I am &s;ure nothing on earth can bia&s;s me.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;aid, &s;he would number the Let|ters according to their dates, and then would give them to me, that I might make &s;uch conditions with

<P>BREAKFAST being over, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on renewed the talk of the vi&s;it made here by Mrs. O-Hara on Sunday la&s;t. Mi&s;s Jervois very prettily expre&s;&s;ed her grief for the trouble given her guardian by her un|happy mother. He drew her to him, as he fat, with looks of tenderne&s;s; and called her his dear Emily; and told her, &s;he was the <HI>Child of his compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> You are called upon, my dear, &s;aid he, young as you are, to a glorious trial; and hitherto you have &s;hone in it: I wi&s;h the poor woman would be but half as much the mother, as you would be the child! But let us read her Letter.</P>
<P>His goodne&s;s overwhelmed her. He took her mo|ther's Letter out of his pocket: She &s;tood before him, drying her eyes, and endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s her emotion: And when he had unfolded the Letter, he put his arm round her wai&s;t. Surely, Lucy, he is the tendere&s;t, as well as brave&s;t of men! What would I give for a picture drawn but with half the life and love which &s;hone out in his looks, as he ca&s;t his eyes, now on the Letter, and now up to his Emily!&mdash;Poor woman! &s;aid he, two or three times, as he read: And, when he had done, You mu&s;t read it, my dear, &s;aid he; there is the mother in it: We will acknow|lege the mother, where-ever we can find her.</P>
<P>Why did not the dear girl throw her arms about his neck, ju&s;t then?&mdash;She was ready to do &s;o. O my be&s;t of guardians! &s;aid &s;he; and, it was plain, was but ju&s;t re&s;trained, by virgin mode&s;ty, from doing &s;o; her hands caught back, as it were, and re&s;ting for a moment on his &s;houlder: And &s;he looked as much aba&s;hed, as if &s;he had <HI>not</HI> checked her&s;elf.</P>
<P>I took more notice of this her grateful motion, than any-body el&s;e. I was affected with the beauti|ful check, and admired her for it.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="108">
And <HI>mu&s;t</HI> I, Sir, would you <HI>have me,</HI> read it? I will retire to my chamber with it.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e, took her hand, and, coming with her to me, put it into mine: Be &s;o good, madam, to for|tify this worthy child's heart, by your prudence and judgment, while &s;he reads the <HI>mother,</HI> in the only in|&s;tance that I have ever known it vi&s;ible in this un|happy woman.</P>
<P>He bowed, and gave me the Letter. I was proud of his compliment, and Emily and I withdrew into the next room; and there the good girl read the Letter, but it was long in reading; her tears often interrupting her: And more than once, as wanting a refuge, &s;he threw her arms about my neck, in &s;ilent grief.</P>
<P>I called her twenty tender names; but I could not &s;ay much: What could I? The Letter in &s;ome places affected <HI>me.</HI> It was the Letter of a mother who &s;eemed extremely &s;en&s;ible of hard&s;hips. Her guardian had promi&s;ed ob&s;ervations upon it: I knew not then all the unhappy woman's wickedne&s;s: I knew not but the hu&s;band might be in &s;ome fault.&mdash;What could I &s;ay? I could not think of giving comfort to a daughter at the expence of even a <HI>bad</HI> mother.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on came to us: She ki&s;&s;ed the &s;obbing girl, and with tenderne&s;s, calling us her two loves, led us into the next room.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, it &s;eems, had owned, in our ab&s;ence, that Mr. and Mrs. O-Hara, and Captain Salmonet, had made him a vi&s;it in town, on their return from Colnebrooke, and expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be vexed at his own behaviour to them.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois gave the Letter to her guardian, and went behind his chair, on the back of which &s;he leaned, while he looked into the Letter, and made ob&s;ervations upon what he read, as nearly in the fol|lowing words as I can remember.</P>
<P><HI>An unhappy mother, who&s;e fau ts have been bar|barou&s;ly</HI> 
<PB N="106" REF="109">
<HI>aggravated</HI> &mdash;My Emily's father was an in|dulgent hu&s;band! He forgave this unhappy woman crimes, which very few men would have forgiven: She was the wife of his choice: He doted on her: His fir&s;t forgivene&s;s of an atrocious crime hardened her.</P>
<P>When he could not live with her, he removed from place to place, to avoid her: At la&s;t, afraid of her private machinations, which were of the blacke&s;t na|ture, he went abroad, in order to pur&s;ue that traffick in per&s;on, which he managed to great advantage by his agents and factors; having fir&s;t, however, made an hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for his wife.</P>
<P>Thither, after &s;ome time pa&s;&s;ed in riot and extra|vagance, &s;he followed him.</P>
<P>I became acquainted with him at Florence. I found him to be a &s;en&s;ible and hone&s;t man; and every one whom he could &s;erve, or a&s;&s;i&s;t, experienced his bene|volence. Not a &s;ingle &s;oul who knew him, but loved him, this wife excepted.</P>
<P>She at <HI>that</HI> time in&s;i&s;ted upon his giving up to her management, his beloved Emily; and &s;olemnly pro|mi&s;ed reformation, on his compliance. She knew that the child would be a great fortune.</P>
<P>I was with Mr. Jervois, on her fir&s;t vi&s;it to him at Leghorn; and, tho' I had heard her character to be very bad, was inclined to befriend her. She was &s;pe|cious. I hoped that a mother, whatever <HI>wife</HI> &s;he made, could not out be a <HI>mother;</HI> and poor Mr. Jer|vois had not been forward to &s;ay the wor&s;t of her: But &s;he did not long &s;ave appearances. The whole Engli&s;h factory at Leghorn were witne&s;&s;es to her fla|grant enormities. She was addicted to an exce&s;s that left her no guard, and made her a &s;tranger to that grace which is the glory of a woman.</P>
<P>I am told, that &s;he is le&s;s frequently intoxicated than heretofore. I &s;hould be glad of the lea&s;t &s;hadow of reformation in her. That odias vice led her int
<PB N="107" REF="110">
every other, and hardened her to a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame. Other vices, perhaps, at fir&s;t, wanted <HI>that</HI> to intro|duce them; but the mo&s;t flagitious have been long ha|bitual to her.</P>
<P>Nothing but the ju&s;tice due to the character of my departed friend, could have induced me to &s;ay what I have &s;aid of this unhappy woman: Forgive me, my Emily. But &s;hall I not defend your father?&mdash;I have not &s;aid the wor&s;t I could &s;ay of his wi&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet &s;he writes, <HI>That her faults have been barba|rou&s;ly aggravated, in order to ju&s;tify the ill u&s;age of an hu&s;band, who,</HI> &s;he &s;ays, <HI>was not &s;aultle&s;s.</HI> Ill u&s;age of an hu&s;band! Wretched woman! She knew I mu&s;t &s;ee this Letter: How could &s;he write thus? She knows that I have authentic proofs in my cu&s;tody, of his unexceptionable goodne&s;s to her; and confe&s;&s;ions, under her own hand, of her guilt, and ingratitude to him.</P>
<P>But, my Emily&mdash;and he aro&s;e, and took her hand, her face over whelmed with tears, You may rejoice in your father's character: He was a good man, in <HI>every</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word. With regard to her, he had but one fault; and that was, his indulgence.&mdash;Shall I &s;ay, That after repeated elopements, after other men had ca&s;t her off, he took her back? When &s;he had for|feited his love, his <HI>pity</HI> operated in her favour; and &s;he was hardened enough to de&s;pi&s;e the man who could much more ea&s;ily forgive than puni&s;h her. I am grieved to be obliged to &s;ay this; but repeat, that the memory of my friend mu&s;t not be unju&s;tly loaded. Would to heaven that I could &s;ugge&s;t the &s;hadow of a plea that would extenuate any part of her vilene&s;s, either re&s;pecting him or her&s;elf; let who&s;e-&s;oever cha|racter &s;uffer by it, I <HI>would</HI> &s;ugge&s;t it. How often has this worthy hu&s;band wept to me, for tho&s;e faults of his wife, for which <HI>&s;he</HI> could not be &s;orry!</P>
<P>I di&s;courage not the&s;e tears, my Emily, on what you have heard me &s;ay; but let me now dry them up.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111">
He took her own handkerchief, and tenderly wiped her cheeks: It is unnece&s;&s;ary, proceeded he, to &s;ay any-thing farther, at this time, in defence of your father's character; we come now to other parts of the Letter, that will not, I hope, be &s;o affecting to the heart of a good child.</P>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ts upon your making her a vi&s;it, or receiv|ing one from her: She longs, &s;he &s;ays, to &s;ee you; to lay you in her bo&s;om. She congratulates you, on your improvements: She very <HI>pathetically</HI> calls upon you, not to de&s;pi&s;e her&mdash;</P>
<P>My dear girl! You <HI>&s;hall</HI> receive her vi&s;it: She &s;hall name her place for it, provided I am pre&s;ent. I &s;hall think it a &s;ign of her amendment, if &s;he is really capable of rejoicing in your improvements. I have always told you, that you mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>crime</HI> and the <HI>mother:</HI> The one is intitled to your pity; the other calls for your abhorrence&mdash;Do you <HI>choo&s;e,</HI> my dear, to &s;ee your mother?&mdash;I hope you do. Let not even the faulty have cau&s;e to complain of unkindne&s;s from us. There are faults that mu&s;t be left to heaven to puni&s;h; and again&s;t the con&s;equences of which, it behoves us only to <HI>guard,</HI> for our own &s;akes. I hope you are in a &s;afe protection, and have nothing to fear from her: You are <HI>guarded,</HI> therefore. Can my Emily forget the terrors of the la&s;t interview, and calmly, in my pre&s;ence, kneel to her mother?</P>
<P>Whatever you command me to do, I will do.</P>
<P>I would have you an&s;wer this Letter. Invite her to the hou&s;e of your guardian&mdash;I think you &s;hould not go to her lodgings: Yet, if you incline to &s;ee her there, and &s;he in&s;i&s;ts upon it, I will attend you.</P>
<P>But, Sir, mu&s;t I own her hu&s;band for my father?</P>
<P>Leave that to me, my dear: Little things, puncti|lios, are not to be &s;tood upon: Pride &s;hall have no concern with us. But I mu&s;t fir&s;t be &s;atisfied, that the man and &s;he are actually married. Who knows, if they <HI>are,</HI> but his dependence on her annuity, and the
<PB N="109" REF="112">
protection &s;he may hope for from him, may make it convenient to both, to live in a more creditable man|ner than hitherto &s;he has aimed to do? If &s;he &s;ave but <HI>appearances,</HI> for the future, it will be a point gained.</P>
<P>I will in every-thing, Sir, do as you would have me.</P>
<P>One thing, my dear, I think I will advi&s;e: If they are really married; if there be any pro&s;pect of their living tolerably together; you &s;hall, if you plea&s;e (your fortune is very large), make them an hand&s;ome pre&s;ent; and give hope, that it will be an annual one, if the man behave with civility to your mother. She complains, that &s;he is made poor, and dependent. Poor if &s;he be, it is her own fault: She brought not 200<HI>l.</HI> to your father. Ungrateful woman! he mar|ried her, as I hinted, for Love. With 200<HI>l.</HI> a year, well paid, &s;he ought not to be poor; but <HI>dependent,</HI> &s;he mu&s;t be. Your father would have given her a larger annuity, had he not known, by experience, that it was but &s;trengthening her hands to do mi&s;chief; and to enable her to be more riotous. I found a de|claration of this kind among his papers, after his death. This his <HI>intention,</HI> if there could have been any hope of a good u&s;e to be made of it, ju&s;tifies my advice to you, to <HI>inlarge</HI> her &s;tipend: I will put it in &s;uch a way, that you, my dear, &s;hall have the credit of it; and I will take upon my&s;elf the advice of re|&s;training it to good behaviour, for their own &s;akes, and for yours.</P>
<P>O Sir! how good you are! You now give me courage to wi&s;h to &s;ee my poor mother, in hopes that it will be in my power to do her good: Continue to your Emily the ble&s;&s;ing of your direction, and I &s;hall be an happy girl indeed. O that my mother <HI>may</HI> be married! that &s;o &s;he may be entitled to the be&s;t you &s;hall advi&s;e me to do for her.</P>
<P>I doubt, her man is a man of the town, added he;
<PB N="110" REF="113">
but he <HI>may</HI> have lived long enough to &s;ee his follies. She <HI>may</HI> be tired of the life &s;he has led. I have made &s;everal efforts to do her &s;ervice; but had no hope to reclaim her; I wi&s;h &s;he may now be a wife in earne&s;t. But this, I think, &s;hall be my la&s;t effort&mdash;Write, my dear; but nothing of your intention. If &s;he is not married, things mu&s;t remain as they are.</P>
<P>She ha&s;tened up-&s;tairs, and very &s;oon returned, with the following lines.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Be&s;eech you to believe, that I am not wanting in duty to my mother. You rejoice my heart, when you tell me, that you love me.

<P>Let me hope, my dear mamma, that you will not be &s;o angry with your poor girl, as you was la&s;t time I &s;aw you at Mrs. Lane's; and then I will &s;ee you with all the duty that a child owes to her mother. For I am, and will ever be,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Sir Charles generou&s;ly &s;crupled the la&s;t paragraph. We will not, I think, Emily, &s;aid he, remind a mother, who has written &s;uch a Letter as that before us, of a behaviour that &s;he &s;hould be glad to forget.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on de&s;ired it might &s;tand. Who knows, &s;ays &s;he, but it may make her a&s;hamed of her outrageous behaviour at that time?</P>
<P>She de&s;erves not generous u&s;age, &s;aid Lady L.; &s;he cannot feel it.</P>
<P>Perhaps <HI>not,</HI> replied Sir Charles; but we &s;hould do proper things, <HI>for our own &s;akes,</HI> whether the per&s;ons
<PB N="111" REF="114">
are capable of feeling them as they ought, or not. What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s Byron, to this la&s;t paragraph?</P>
<P>I was entirely in his way of thinking, and for the rea&s;on he gave; but the two Ladies having given their opinion in a pretty earne&s;t manner, and my Lord &s;ay|ing he thought it might pa&s;s, I was afraid it would look like be&s;peaking his favour at their expence, if I adopted his &s;entiments: I therefore declined giving my opinion. But being willing to keep Emily in coun|tenance, who &s;at &s;u&s;pended in her judgment, as one who feared &s;he had done a wrong thing; I &s;aid, it was a very natural paragraph, I thought, from Mi&s;s Jer|vois's pen, as it was written, I dared to &s;ay, rather in apprehen&s;ion of hard treatment, from what &s;he re|membered of the la&s;t, than in a &s;pirit of recrimination or re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The good girl declared, it was. Both Ladies, and my Lord, &s;aid, I had di&s;tingui&s;hed well: But Sir Charles, tho' he &s;aid no more upon the &s;ubject, look|ed upon each &s;i&s;ter with meaning; which I wondered they did not ob&s;erve. Dr. Bartlett was withdrawn, or I believe he would have had the hone&s;ty to &s;peak out, which I had not: But the point was a point of delicacy and genero&s;ity; and I thought I &s;hould not &s;eem to imagine that I under&s;tood it better than they: Nor did I think that Sir Charles would have acqui|e&s;ced with their opinion.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois retired, to tran&s;cribe her letter. We all &s;eparated, to dre&s;s; and I, having &s;oon made an alteration in mine, dropt in upon Dr. Bartlett in his clo&s;et.</P>
<P>I am &s;tealing from this good man a little improve|ment in my geography: I am delighted with my tutor, and he profe&s;&s;es to be plea&s;ed with his &s;cholar; but &s;ometimes more intere&s;ting articles &s;lide in: But now he had ju&s;t began to talk of Mi&s;s Jervois, as if he would have led, I thought, to the propo&s;al hinted at by Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, from the letter &s;he had &s;o clan|de&s;tinely
<PB N="112" REF="115">
&s;een, of my taking her under my care, when Sir Charles entered the doctor's apartment. He would have withdrawn, when he &s;aw me; but the doctor, ri&s;ing from his chair, be&s;ought him to oblige us with his company.</P>
<P>I was &s;illy: I did not expect to be caught there. But why was I &s;illy on being found with Dr. Bart|lett&mdash;But let me tell you, that I thought Sir Charles him&s;elf, at fir&s;t, addre&s;&s;ing me, &s;eemed a little unpre|pared. You invited me in, doctor: Here I am. But if you were upon a &s;ubject that you do not pur&s;ue, I &s;hall look upon my&s;elf as an intruder, and will with|draw.</P>
<P>We had ju&s;t concluded one &s;ubject, and were be|ginning another&mdash;I had ju&s;t mentioned Mi&s;s Jervois.</P>
<P>Is not Emily a good child, Mi&s;s Byron? &s;aid Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, &s;he is.</P>
<P>We then had &s;ome general talk of the unhappy &s;ituation &s;he is in from &s;uch a mother; and I thought &s;ome hints would have been given of his de&s;ire that &s;he &s;hould accompany me down to Northampton|&s;hire; and my heart throbbed, to think how it would be brought in, and how I &s;hould behave upon it: And the more, as I was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;o much as heard of &s;uch a de&s;igned propo&s;al. What would it have done, had I been prevailed upon to read the letter? But not one word pa&s;&s;ed, leading to that &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>I now begin to <HI>fear,</HI> that he has changed his mind, if that <HI>was</HI> his mind. Methinks I am more fond of having the good girl with us, than I imagined it was po&s;&s;ible I ever could have been. What a different appearance have things to us, when they are out of our power, to what they had when we believed they were in it?</P>
<P>But I &s;ee not, that there is the lea&s;t likelihood that any-thing, on which you had all &s;et your hearts, can happen&mdash;I can't help it.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="116">
Emily, flattering girl! told me, &s;he &s;aw great &s;igns of attachment to me in his eyes and behaviour; but I &s;ee no grounds for &s;uch a &s;urmi&s;e: His affections are certainly engaged. God ble&s;s him, whatever his engagements are!&mdash;When he was ab&s;ent, encouraged by his &s;i&s;ters and Lord L. I thought pretty well of my&s;elf; but, now he is pre&s;ent, I &s;ee &s;o many excel|lencies &s;hining out in his mind, in his air and addre&s;s, that my humility gets the better of my ambition.</P>
<P>Ambition! did I &s;ay? Yes, ambition, Lucy. Is it not the nature of the pa&s;&s;ion we are &s;o fooli&s;hly apt to call <HI>noble,</HI> to exalt the object, and to lower, if not to deba&s;e, one's &s;elf&mdash;You &s;ee how Lord W. depre|ciates me on the &s;core of fortune. I was loth to take notice of that before, becau&s;e I knew, that were &s;len|derne&s;s of fortune the only difficulty, the partiality of all my friends for their Harriet would put them upon making efforts that I would &s;ooner die than &s;uffer to be made.</P>
<P>I forgot the manner in which Lord W.'s objection was permitted to go off&mdash;But I remember, Sir Charles made no attempt to an&s;wer it: And yet he tells my Lord, that fortune is not a principal article with him; and that he has an ample e&s;tate of his own. No que&s;tion but a man's duties will ri&s;e with his oppor|tunities. A man, therefore, may be as good with a le&s;s e&s;tate, as with a larger: And is not goodne&s;s the e&s;&s;ential part of happine&s;s? Be our &s;tation what it will, have we any concern but humbly to acquie&s;ce in it, and fulfil our duties?</P>
<P>But who, for &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations, can wi&s;h to <HI>circum&s;cribe</HI> the power of this good man? The greater opportunities he has of doing good, the higher mu&s;t be his enjoyment.&mdash;No, Lucy, do not let us flatter our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Sir Charles rejoices, on Sir Hargrave's having ju&s;t now, by letter, &s;u&s;pended the appointment till next week, of his dining with him at his hou&s;e on the fo|re&s;t.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XV.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>I Left Sir Charles with Dr. Bartlett. They would both have engaged me to &s;tay longer; but I thought the Ladies would mi&s;s me, and think it parti|cular to find me with him in the doctor's clo&s;et.</P>
<P>My Lord, and the two &s;i&s;ters, were together in the drawing-room adjoining to the library: On my en|trance, Well, Harriet, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, we will now endeavour to find out my brother: You mu&s;t be pre&s;ent to your&s;elf, and put in a word now-and-then. We &s;hall &s;ee if Dr. Bartlett is right, when he &s;ays, that my brother is the mo&s;t unre&s;erved of men.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in Dr. Bartlett&mdash;I think, doctor, &s;aid Lady L. we will take your advice, and a&s;k my brother all the que&s;tions in relation to his engage|ments abroad, that come into our heads.</P>
<P>She had not done &s;peaking, when Sir Charles en|tered, and drew his chair next me; and ju&s;t <HI>then</HI> I thought my&s;elf he looked upon me with equal benig|nity and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on began with taking notice of the letter from which Dr. Bartlett, &s;he &s;aid, had read &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, of the happine&s;s he had procured to Lord W. in ridding him of his woman. She wi&s;hed, &s;he told him, that &s;he knew who was the Lady he had in his thoughts to commend to my Lord for a wife.</P>
<P>I will have a little talk with her before I name her, even to you, my Lord, and my &s;i&s;ters. I am &s;ure my &s;i&s;ters will approve of their aunt, if &s;he accept of my Lord for a hu&s;band: I &s;hall pay my compliments to her, in my return from Grandi&s;on-hall.&mdash;Do you, Charlotte, choo&s;e to accompany me thither?

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Revenge!&mdash;Not revenge, neither&mdash;But when the Lord W. as by the <HI>pa&s;&s;ages</HI> Dr. Bartlett was &s;o good as to read to us, propo&s;ed to you this Lady for a wife, and that Lady; your an&s;wers gave us appre|hen&s;ion that you are not inclined to marry&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> You are very unceremonious, Charlotte&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed, Lucy, &s;he made me tremble. Sure he can have no notion that I have &s;een the <HI>whole</HI> Letter&mdash;&s;een my&s;elf named in it.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> What &s;ignifies ceremony, among relati|ons?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Let Charlotte have her way.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Why then, Sir, I would a&s;k&mdash;Don't you intend one day to marry?</P>
<P><HI>Sir. Ch.</HI> I do, Charlotte. I &s;hall not think my&s;elf happy till I can obtain the hand of a worthy woman.</P>
<P>I was, I am afraid, Lucy, vi&s;ibly affected: I knew
<PB N="116" REF="119">
not how to &s;tay; yet it would have looked wor&s;e to go.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Very well, Sir&mdash;And pray, Have you not, either abroad or at home, &s;een the woman you could wi&s;h to call yours?&mdash;Don't think me imperti|nent, brother.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> You cannot be impertinent, Charlotte. If you want to know any-thing of me, it plea&s;e me be&s;t, when you come directly to the point.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Well, then, if I cannot be impertinent; if you are be&s;t plea&s;ed when you are mo&s;t freely treat|ed; and if you are inclined to marry; pray why did you decline the prpo&s;als mentioned by Lord W. in behalf of Lady Francis N. of Lady Anne S. and I can|not tell how many more?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> The friends of the fir&s;t-named Lady pro|ceeded not generou&s;ly with my father, in that affair. The whole family builds too much on the intere&s;t and title of her father. I wanted not to depend upon any public man: I cho&s;e, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to fix my happine&s;s within my own little circle. I have &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions. I am not without ambition. Had I loo&s;ened the reins to the latter, young man as I am, my tran|quillity would have been pinned to the feather in an|other man's cap. Does this &s;atisfy you, Charlotte, as to Lady Frances?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Why yes: And the ea&s;ier, becau&s;e there is a Lady whom I could have preferred to Lady Frances.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not, thought I, have been pre&s;ent at this conver&s;ation. Lord L. looked at me. Lord L. &s;hould <HI>not</HI> have looked at me: The Ladies did not.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Who is &s;he?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Lady Anne S. you know, Sir&mdash;Pray, may I a&s;k, why that <HI>could not be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Lady Anne is, I believe, a de&s;erving wo|man; but her fortune mu&s;t have been my principal inducement, had I made my addre&s;&s;es to her. I never
<PB N="117" REF="120">
yet went &s;o low as to that alone, for an inducement to &s;ee a Lady three times.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Then, Sir, you <HI>have</HI> made your ad|dre&s;&s;es to Ladies&mdash;Abroad, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I thought, Charlotte, your curio&s;ity ex|tended only to the Ladies in England.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Yes, Sir, it extends to Ladies in Eng|land and out of England, if any there be that have kept my brother a &s;ingle man, when &s;uch offers have been made him as we think would have been unex|ceptionable: But you hint, then, Sir, that there <HI>are</HI> Ladies abroad&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Take care, Charlotte, that you make as free a re&s;pondent, when it comes to your turn, as you are a que&s;tioner.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> By your an&s;wers to my que&s;tions, Sir, teach me how I am to an&s;wer yours, if you have any to make.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Very well, Charlotte. Have I not an|&s;wered &s;atisfactorily your que&s;tions about the Ladies you named?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Pretty well. But, Sir, have you not &s;een Ladies abroad whom you like better than either of tho&s;e I have named?&mdash;An&s;wer me to that.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I <HI>have,</HI> Charlotte, and at home too.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I don't know what to &s;ay to you&mdash;But, pray, Sir, Have you not &s;een Ladies abroad whom you have liked better than any you ever &s;aw at home?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> No. But tell me, Charlotte, to what does all this tend?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Only, brother, that we long to have you happily married; and we are afraid, that your declining this propo&s;al and that, is owing to &s;ome previous attachment&mdash;And now <HI>all</HI> is out.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> And now, my dear brother, all <HI>is</HI> out&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> If our brother will gratify our curio&s;ity&mdash;</P>
<P>Had I ever before, Lucy, &s;o great a call upon me as now, for pre&s;ence of mind?</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="121">
Sir Charles &s;ighed: He pau&s;ed: And at la&s;t &s;aid&mdash;You are very generous, very kind, in your wi&s;hes to &s;ee me married. I <HI>have</HI> &s;een the Lady with whom, of all the women in the world, I think I could be happy.</P>
<P>A fine blu&s;h over&s;pread his face, and he looked down. Why, Sir Charles, did you blu&s;h? Why did you look down? The happy, thrice happy woman, was not pre&s;ent, was &s;he?&mdash;Ah, No! no! no!&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> And now, Charlotte, what other que&s;tions have you to a&s;k, before it comes to your turn to an|&s;wer &s;ome that I have to put to <HI>you?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Only one.&mdash;Is the Lady a foreign Lady?</P>
<P>How every-body but I looked at him, expecting his an&s;wer!&mdash;He really he&s;itated. At la&s;t, I think, Charlotte, you will excu&s;e me, if I &s;ay, that this que&s;tion gives me &s;ome pain&mdash;Becau&s;e it leads to <HI>an|other,</HI> that, <HI>if</HI> made, I <HI>cannot at pre&s;ent my&s;elf an&s;wer</HI> [But why &s;o, Sir, thought I?]: And if <HI>not</HI> made, it cannot be of any &s;ignification to &s;peak to this.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> We would not give you pain, Sir Charles; And yet&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> What <HI>yet,</HI> my dear Lord L.?</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> When I was at Florence, there was much talk&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Of a Lady of that city.&mdash;Olivia, my Lord!&mdash;There was.&mdash;She has fine qualities, but un|happily blended with others le&s;s approveable.&mdash;But I have nothing to wi&s;h for from Olivia: She has done me too much honour. I &s;hould not &s;o readily have named her now, had &s;he been more &s;ollicitous to con|ceal the di&s;tinction &s;he honoured me with. But your Lord&s;hip, I dare hope, never heard even ill-will open its mouth to her di&s;reputation, only that &s;he de&s;cended too much in her regard for one object.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Your character, Sir Charles, was as much to her reputation, as&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch. (interrupting).</HI> O my Lord, how <HI>brotherly</HI> 
<PB N="119" REF="122">
partial! But, this Lady out of the que&s;tion, my peace has been broken in pieces by a tender fault in my con|&s;titution&mdash;And yet I would not be without it.</P>
<P>The &s;weet Emily aro&s;e, and, in tears, went to the window. A &s;ob, endeavoured to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, called our attention to her.</P>
<P>Sir Charles went, and took her hand; Why weeps my Emily?</P>
<P>Becau&s;e you, who &s;o well de&s;erve to be happy, &s;eem not to be &s;o.</P>
<P>Tender examples, Lucy, are catching: I had much ado to re&s;train <HI>my</HI> tears.</P>
<P>He kindly con&s;oled her. My unhappine&s;s, my dear, &s;aid he, ari&s;es chiefly from that of other people. I &s;hould but for <HI>that</HI> be happy in my&s;elf, becau&s;e I endeavour to accommodate my mind to bear inevi|table evils, and to make, if po&s;&s;ible, a virtue of ne|ce&s;&s;ity: But, Charlotte, &s;ee how grave you have made us all! and yet I mu&s;t enter with <HI>you</HI> upon a &s;ubject that po&s;&s;ibly may be thought as &s;erious by you, as that which, at pre&s;ent, I wi&s;h to quit.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Wi&s;h to quit!" "The que&s;tion gave him &s;ome pain, becau&s;e it led to another, which he cannot him&s;elf at pre&s;ent, an&s;wer!&mdash;"</Q></P>
<P>What, Lucy, let me a&s;k you, before I follow him to his next &s;ubject, can you gather from what pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>that</HI> already recited? If he is him&s;elf at an uncer|tainty, he may de&s;erve to be pitied, and not blamed: But don't you think he might have an&s;wered, whether the Lady is a foreigner, or not?&mdash;How could he <HI>know</HI> what the next que&s;tion would have been?</P>
<P>I had the a&s;&s;urance to ask Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on after|wards, a&s;ide, Whether any-thing could be made out, or gue&s;&s;ed at, by his eyes, when he &s;poke of having <HI>&s;een</HI> the woman he could prefer to all others? For he &s;at next me; &s;he over-again&s;t him.</P>
<P>I know not what to make of him, &s;aid &s;he: But be the Lady native or foreigner, it is my humble opinion,
<PB N="120" REF="123">
that my brother is in love. He has all the &s;ymptoms of it, that I can gue&s;s by.</P>
<P>I am of Charlotte's opinion, Lucy. Such tender &s;entiments; &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s of manners; &s;uch gen|tlene&s;s of voice!&mdash;Love has certainly done all this for him: And the Lady, to be &s;ure, is a foreigner. It would be &s;trange if &s;uch a man &s;hould not have en|gaged his heart in the &s;even or eight years pa&s;t; and tho&s;e from Eighteen to Twenty-&s;ix or &s;even, the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible of a man's life.</P>
<P>But what means he by &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His peace has been broken to pieces by a tender fault in his con&s;titu|tion?"</Q>&mdash;Compa&s;&s;ion, I &s;uppo&s;e, for &s;ome unhappy object.&mdash;I will &s;oon return to town, and there prepare to throw my&s;elf into the arms of my deare&s;t relations in Northampton&s;hire: I &s;hall otherwi&s;e, perhaps, add to the number of tho&s;e who have broken his peace.</P>
<P>But it is &s;trange, methinks, that he could not have an&s;wered, Whether the Lady is a foreigner, or not.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, you are mi&s;taken: Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on is not &s;o very <HI>un</HI> -re&s;erved a man as you &s;aid he was.</P>
<P>But Oh! my dear little flattering Emily, how could you tell me, that you watched his eyes, and &s;aw them always kindly bent on me&mdash;Yes, perhaps, when you thought &s;o, he was drawing compari&s;ons to the ad|vantage of his fair foreigner, from my le&s;s agreeable features!&mdash;</P>
<P>But this Olivia! Lucy. I want to know &s;omething more of <HI>her.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nothing," he &s;ays, to wi&s;h for from Olivia."</Q> Poor Lady! Methinks I am very much inclined to pity her.</P>
<P>Well, but I will proceed now to his next &s;ubject. I wi&s;h I could find &s;ome faults in him. It is a <HI>cruel</HI> thing to be under a kind of nece&s;&s;ity to be angry with a man whom we cannot blame: And yet, in the next conver&s;ation, you will &s;ee <HI>him</HI> angry.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XVI.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>NOW, Charlotte, &s;aid he (as if he had fully an|&s;wered the que&s;tions put to him&mdash;O the&s;e men!) let me a&s;k <HI>you</HI> a que&s;tion or two&mdash;I had a vi&s;it made me ye&s;terday, by Lord G.. What, my dear, do you intend to do, with regard to him?&mdash;But perhaps, you would choo&s;e to withdraw with me, on this que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I wi&s;h I had made to you the &s;ame over|ture of withdrawing, Sir Charles, on the que&s;tions I put to you; I &s;hould have had more &s;atisfaction given me, I fan&s;y, than I can boa&s;t of, if I had.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I will withdraw with you, if you plea&s;e, and hear any other que&s;tions you have to put to me.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You can put no que&s;tions to me, Sir, that I &s;hall have any objection to an&s;wer before this company.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> You know my que&s;tion, Charlotte.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> What would <HI>you</HI> advi&s;e me to do in that affair, brother?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I have only one piece of advice to give you:&mdash;It is, That you will either encourage or di&s;|courage his addre&s;s, if you know your own mind.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I believe, brother, you want to get rid of me.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Then you intend to encourage Lord G?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Does that follow, Sir?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Or you could not have &s;upp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ed, that I wanted to part with you. But, come, Charlotte, let us retire. It is very difficult to get a direct an&s;wer to &s;uch que&s;tions as the&s;e, from Ladies, before company, tho' the company be ever &s;o nearly related to them.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I can an&s;wer, before this company, any que&s;tions that relate to Lord G.</P>
<PB N="122" REF="125">
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Then you <HI>don't</HI> intend to encourage him?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I don't &s;ee how that follows, neither, from what I &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> It does, very clearly. I am not an ab&s;o|lute &s;tranger to the language of women, Charlotte.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I thought my brother too polite to re|flect upon the &s;ex.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Is it to reflect upon the &s;ex, to &s;ay, that I am not an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to their language?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I prote&s;t, I think &s;o, in the way you &s;poke it.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Well, then, try if you cannot find a lan|guage to &s;peak in, that may <HI>not</HI> be capable of &s;uch an interpretation.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I am afraid you are di&s;plea&s;ed with me, brother. I will an&s;wer more directly.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Do, my Charlotte: I have promi&s;ed Lord G. to procure him an an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Is the que&s;tion he puts, Sir, a brief one&mdash;<HI>On,</HI> or <HI>off?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Tru&s;t me, Charlotte: You <HI>may,</HI> even with your punctilio.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Will you not advi&s;e me, Sir?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I will&mdash;To pur&s;ue your inclination.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Suppo&s;e, if I knew <HI>yours,</HI> that <HI>that</HI> would turn the &s;cale?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Is the balance even?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I can't &s;ay that, neither.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Then <HI>di&s;mi&s;s</HI> my Lord G.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Indeed, brother, you are angry with me.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> (addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me) I am &s;ure, Mi&s;s Byron, that I &s;hall find, in &s;uch points as this, a very different <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> in you, when I come to be favoured with the peru&s;al of your Letters. Your cou&s;in Reeves once &s;aid, That when you knew your own mind, you never kept any one in &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> But I can't &s;ay that I <HI>know</HI> my mind, ab&s;olutely.</P>
<PB N="123" REF="126">
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> That is another thing. I am &s;ilent. Only when you do, I &s;hall take it for a favour, if you will communicate it to me for your &s;ervice.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I am among my be&s;t friends&mdash;Lord L. what is your advice? Sir Charles does not incline to give me his.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> It is owing to my regard to your own in|clinations, and not to di&s;plea&s;ure or petulance, that I do not.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> I have a very good opinion of Lord G. What is yours, my dear? to Lady L.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> I really think very well of my Lord G. What is yours, Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I believe Mi&s;s Grand&s;on mu&s;t be the &s;ole determiner, on this occa&s;ion. If <HI>&s;he</HI> has no ob|jection, I pre&s;ume to think, that no one el&s;e can have any.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Explain, explain, Harriet&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Mi&s;s Byron an&s;wers as &s;he always does: Penetration and prudence, with her, never quit com|pany. If I have the honour to explain her &s;entiments in giving mine, take both as follow: My Lord G. is a good natured, mild man: He will make a woman happy, who has &s;ome &s;hare of prudence, tho' &s;he has a &s;till greater &s;hare of will. Charlotte is very lively: She loves her je&s;t <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as well as &s;he loves her friend&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> How, brother!</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> And Lord G. will not &s;tand in competition with her, in that re&s;pect: There &s;hould not be a ri|valry in particular qualities, in marriage. I have known a poet commence an hatred to his wife, on her being complimented with making better ver&s;es than he. Let Charlotte agree upon tho&s;e qualities in which &s;he will a low her hu&s;band to excel; and he allow, in her, tho&s;e &s;he has a de&s;ire to monopolize; and all may do well.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Then Lord G. mu&s;t not be di&s;puted
<PB N="124" REF="127">
with, I pre&s;ume, were I to be his wife, on the &s;ub|ject of moths and butterflies.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Yet Lord G. may give them up, when he has a more con&s;iderable trifle to amu&s;e him&s;elf with. Pardon me, Charlotte&mdash;Are you not, as far as we have gone in this conver&s;ation, a pretty trifler?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> (bowing) Thank you, brother. The epithets <HI>pretty,</HI> and <HI>young,</HI> and <HI>little,</HI> are great quali|fiers of har&s;h words.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> But do you like Sir Walter Watkyns bet|ter than Lord G.?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I think not. He is not, I believe, &s;o <HI>good-natured</HI> a man as the other.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I am glad you make that di&s;tinction, Charlotte.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You think it a nece&s;&s;ary one in my ca&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I have a Letter of his to an&s;wer. He is very urgent with me for my intere&s;t with you. I am to an&s;wer it. Will you tell me, my &s;i&s;ter (giving her the Letter), what &s;hall I &s;ay?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> (after peru&s;ing it) Why, ay, poor man! he is very much in love: But I &s;hould have &s;ome trouble to teach him to &s;pell. And yet, they &s;ay, he has both French and Italian at his &s;ingers ends.</P>
<P>She then began to pull in pieces the Letter.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I will not permit that, Charlotte. Pray return me the Letter. No woman is intitled to ri|dicule a Lover whom &s;he does not intend to encourage. If &s;he has a good opinion of her&s;elf, &s;he will pity him. Whether &s;he has or not, if &s;he wounds, &s;he &s;hould heal. Sir Walter may addre&s;s him&s;elf to an hundred women, who, for the &s;ake of his gay appearance and good e&s;tate, will forgive him his indifferent &s;pelling.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> The &s;luttering &s;ea&s;on is approaching. One wants now and&punc;then a <HI>dangling</HI> fellow or two after one in public: Perhaps I have not &s;een enough of <HI>either</HI> of the&s;e to determine which to <HI>choo&s;e.</HI> Will
<PB N="125" REF="128">
you not allow one, &s;ince neither of them have <HI>very</HI> &s;triking merits, to behold them in different lights, in order to enable one's &s;elf to judge which is the mo&s;t <HI>tolerable</HI> of the two? Or, whether a &s;till <HI>more</HI> tole|rable wretch may not offer?</P>
<P>She &s;poke this in her very arche&s;t manner, &s;erious as the &s;ubject was; and &s;eriou&s;ly as her brother wi&s;hed to know her inclinations.</P>
<P>Sir Charles turned to Lord L. and gravely &s;aid, I wonder how our cou&s;in Everard is amu&s;ing him&s;elf, at this in&s;tant, at the Hall.</P>
<P>She was &s;en&s;ible of the intended rebuke, and a&s;ked him to forgive her.</P>
<P>Wit, my Lord, continued he, inattentive to the pardon &s;he a&s;ked, is a dangerous weapon: But that &s;pecies of it which cannot &s;hine without a foil, is not a wit to be proud of. The Lady before me (what is her name?) and I, have been both under a mi&s;take: I took her for my &s;i&s;ter Charlotte: She took me for our cou&s;in Everard.</P>
<P>Every one felt the &s;everity. It &s;eemed to pierce me, as if directed to me. So unu&s;ually &s;evere from Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; and delivered with &s;uch &s;erious unconcern in the manner; I would not, at that mo|ment, have been Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on for the world.</P>
<P>She did not know which way to look. Lady L. (amiable woman!) felt it for her &s;i&s;ter: Tears were in the eyes of both.</P>
<P>At la&s;t&punc; Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on aro&s;e. I will take away the impo&s;tor, Sir; and when I can rectify my mi&s;take, and bring you back your <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> I hope you will re|ceive her with your u&s;ual goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>My Charlotte! my Si&s;ter! (taking her hand) you mu&s;t not be <HI>very</HI> angry with me. I love to feel the <HI>finer</HI> edge of your wit: But when I was be&s;peaking your attention upon a very &s;erious &s;ubject; a &s;ubject that concerned the happine&s;s of your future life, and, if <HI>yours,</HI> mine; and you could be able to &s;ay &s;ome|thing

that became only the mouth of an unprincipled woman to &s;ay; how could I forbear to wi&s;h that &s;ome <HI>other</HI> woman, and not my &s;i&s;ter, had &s;aid it?&mdash;<HI>Times</HI> and <HI>occa&s;ions,</HI> my dear Charlotte!</P>
<P>No more, I be&s;eech you, Sir: I am &s;en&s;ible of my folly. Let me retire.</P>
<P>I, Charlotte, will retire; don't <HI>you;</HI> but take the comfort your friends are di&s;po&s;ed to give you. Emily, one word with you, my dear. She flew to him, and they went out together.</P>
<P>There, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, has he taken the girl with him, to warn her again&s;t falling into my folly.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett retired in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Lady L. expre&s;&s;ed her concern for her &s;i&s;ter; but &s;aid, Indeed, Charlotte, I was afraid you would carry the matter too far.</P>
<P>Lord L. blamed her. Indeed, &s;i&s;ter, he bore with you a great while; and the affair was a &s;erious one. He had engaged very &s;eriou&s;ly, and even from prin|ciple, in it. O Mi&s;s Byron! he will be delighted with you, when he comes to read your papers, and fees your treatment of the humble &s;ervants you re&s;olved not to encourage.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, Harriet will &s;hine, at my expence; but <HI>may</HI> &s;he!&mdash;Since I have lo&s;t my brother's favour, I pray to heaven, that &s;he may gain it: But he &s;hall ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er again have rea&s;on to &s;ay, I take him for my cou&s;in Everard. But was I <HI>very</HI> wicked, Harriet!&mdash;Deal fairly with me: Was I <HI>very</HI> wicked?</P>
<P>I thought you wrong all the way: I was afraid for you. But for what you la&s;t &s;aid, about encouraging men to dangle after you, and &s;eeming to aim at make|ing new conque&s;ts, I could have chidden you, had you <HI>not</HI> had your brother to hear it. Will you forgive me? (whi&s;pering her) They were the words of a very coquet, and the air was &s;o arch!&mdash;Indeed, my Charlotte, you were very much out of the way.</P>
<P>So! Every-body again&s;t me!&mdash;I mu&s;t have been wrong, indeed&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="130">
The <HI>time,</HI> the <HI>occa&s;ion,</HI> was wrong, &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, &s;aid Lord L. Had the &s;ubject been of le&s;s weight, your brother would have pa&s;&s;ed it off as plea&s;antly as he has always before done your vivacities.</P>
<P>Very happy, replied &s;he, to have &s;uch a character, that every-body mu&s;t be in fault who differs from him, or offends him.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of his di&s;plea&s;ure, Charlotte, &s;aid Lady L. he forgot not the brother. The &s;ubject, he told you concerned the happine&s;s of your future life; and, if <HI>yours,</HI> his.</P>
<P>One remark, re&s;umed Lord L. I mu&s;t make, to Sir Charles's honour (take it not ami&s;s, &s;i&s;ter Char|lotte): Not the lea&s;t hint did he give of your error relating to a certain affair; and yet he mu&s;t think of it, &s;o lately as he has extricated you from it. His aim, evidently, is, to amend, not to wound.</P>
<P>I think, my Lord, retorted Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, with a glow in her cheeks, you might have &s;pared your re|mark. If the one brother did not <HI>recriminate,</HI> the other needed not to <HI>remind.</HI> My Lord, you have not my thanks for your remark.</P>
<P>This affected good Lady L. Pray, &s;i&s;ter, blame not my Lord: You will lo&s;e my pity, if you do. Are not we <HI>four</HI> united in one cau&s;e? Surely, Char|lotte, we are to &s;peak our whole hearts to each other!</P>
<P>So! I have brought man and wife upon me now. Plea&s;e the Lord I will be married, in hopes to have <HI>&s;omebody</HI> on my &s;ide. But, Harriet, &s;ay, Am I wrong <HI>again?</HI></P>
<P>I hope, my dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, replied I, that what you &s;aid to my Lord, was in plea&s;antry: And, if &s;o, the fault was, that you &s;poke it with too grave an air.</P>
<P>Well, well, let me take hold of your hand, my dear, to help me out of this <HI>new</HI> difficulty. I am dreadfully out of luck to-day. I am &s;orry I &s;poke not my plea&s;antry with a plea&s;ant air&mdash;Yet were not you
<PB N="128" REF="131">
likewi&s;e guilty of the &s;ame fault, Lady L.? Did not you correct me with too grave an air?</P>
<P>I am very willing, returned Lady L. it &s;hould pa&s;s &s;o: But, my dear, you mu&s;t not, by your petulance, rob your&s;elf of the &s;incerity of one of the be&s;t hearts in the world; looking with complacency at her Lord.</P>
<P>He bowed to her with an affectionate air.&mdash;Happy couple!</P>
<P>As I hope to live, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, I thought you all pitied me, when Sir Charles laid &s;o heavy an hand upon me: And &s;o <HI>he</HI> &s;eemed to think, by what he &s;aid at going out. How did you deceive me, all of you, by your eyes!</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, &s;aid my Lord, I did pity you: But had I not thought my &s;i&s;ter in fault, I &s;hould <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, my Lord. You are a <HI>nice</HI> di&s;tin|gui&s;her.</P>
<P>And a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> one, Charlotte, rejoined Lady L.</P>
<P>No doubt of it, Lady L. and that was <HI>your</HI> motive too. I be&s;eech you, let me not be <HI>deprived of your pity.</HI> I have <HI>yours</HI> al&s;o, Harriet, upon the &s;ame kind con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Why now <HI>this</HI> archne&s;s becomes you, Charlotte, &s;aid I [I was willing it &s;hould pa&s;s &s;o, Lucy]: This is pretty plea&s;antry.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>pretty</HI> &s;pecimen of Charlotte's penitence, &s;aid Lady L.</P>
<P>I was glad Lady L. &s;poke this with an air of good humour; but Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on withdrew upon it, not well plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>We heard her at her harp&s;ichord, and we all joined her. Emily al&s;o was drawn to us, by the mu&s;ic. Tell me, my dear, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on to her (&s;topping), Have you not had all my faults laid before you, for your caution?</P>
<P>Indeed, madam, my guardian &s;aid but one word about you; and this was it: I love my &s;i&s;ter: She has amiable qualities: We are none of us right at all
<PB N="129" REF="132">
times. You &s;ee, Emily, that I, in chiding her, &s;poke with a little too much petulance.</P>
<P>God for ever ble&s;s my brother! &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on in a kind of rapture: But now his goodne&s;s makes my flippancy odious to my&s;elf&mdash;Sit down, my child, and play your Italian air.</P>
<P>This brought in Sir Charles. He entered with a look of &s;erenity, as if nothing had pa&s;&s;ed to di&s;turb him.</P>
<P>When Emily had done playing, and &s;inging, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on began to make apologies: But he &s;aid, Let us forget each other's failings, Charlotte.</P>
<P>Notice being given of dinner, Lord L. took my hand, and Sir Charles complai&s;antly led his &s;i&s;ter Charlotte to her &s;eat at the table; Lady L. being gone into the dining parlour before.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t <HI>intolerable</HI> &s;uperiority!&mdash;I wi&s;h he would do &s;omething wrong; &s;omething cruel: If he would but bear malice, would but &s;tiffen his air by re&s;entment, it would be &s;omething. As a MAN, cannot he be lordly, and a&s;&s;uming, and where he is &s;o much re|garded, I may &s;ay <HI>feared,</HI> nod his imperial &s;ignificance to his va&s;&s;als about him?&mdash;Cannot he be imperious to &s;ervants, to &s;hew his di&s;plea&s;ure with principals?&mdash;No! it is <HI>natural</HI> to him to be good and ju&s;t. His whole aim, as my Lord ob&s;erved, is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to convince and amend; and not to wound or hurt."</Q></P>
<P>After dinner, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on put into my hands the parcel of my Letters which I had con&s;ented Sir Charles &s;hould &s;ee. Mi&s;s Byron, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, will oblige you with the peru&s;al of &s;ome of her Letters. You will in them &s;ee another &s;ort of woman than your Charlotte. May I amend, and be but half as good!&mdash;When you have read them, you will &s;ay, Amen; and, if your prayer take place, will be &s;ati&s;|fied with your &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>He received them from me, &s;tanding up, bowing, and ki&s;&s;ed the papers, with an air of gallantry that I
<PB N="130" REF="133">
thought greatly became him. [O the vanity of the girl! methinks my uncle &s;ays, at this place.] He put them in his pocket.</P>
<P>Without conditions, Harriet? &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. Except tho&s;e of candour, yet correction, an&s;wered I. Again he bowed to me.</P>
<P>I don't know what to &s;ay to it, Lucy; but I think Sir Charles looks highly plea&s;ed to hear me prai&s;ed; and the Ladies and my Lord mi&s;s no opportunity to &s;ay kind things of me. But could he not have an|&s;wered Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's que&s;tion, Whether his fa|vourite was a <HI>foreigner,</HI> or not?&mdash;Had any other que&s;tion ari&s;en afterwards, that he had not cared to an&s;wer, he could but have declined an&s;wering it, as he did that.</P>
<P>What a great deal of writing does the reciting of half an hour or an hour's conver&s;ation make, when there are three or four &s;peakers in company; and one attempts to write what each &s;ays in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> per&s;on! I am amazed at the quantity, on looking back. But it <HI>will</HI> be &s;o in narrative Letter-writing. Did not you, Lucy, write as long Letters, when you went with your brother to Paris?&mdash;I forget. Only this I remember, that I always was &s;orry when I came to the end of them. I am afraid it is quite otherwi&s;e with mine.</P>
<P>By the way, I am concerned that Lady D. is angry with me: Yet, methinks, &s;he &s;hews, by her anger, that &s;he had a value for me. As to what you tell me, of Lord D.'s &s;etting his heart on the propo&s;ed alli|ance; I am not &s;o much concerned at that, becau&s;e he never &s;aw me: And had the affair been in his own power, 'tis likely he would not have been very &s;olici|tous about his &s;ucce&s;s. Many a one, Lucy, I be|lieve, has found an ardor, when repul&s;ed, which they would never have known, had they &s;ucceded.</P>
<P>Lady Betty, and Mi&s;s Clements, were &s;o good as to make me a vi&s;it, this afternoon, in their way to
<PB N="131" REF="134">
Wind&s;or, where they are to pa&s;s two or three days. They lamented my long ab&s;ence from town; and Lady Betty kindly regretted for me, the many fine entertainments I had lo&s;t, both public and private, by my country excur&s;ion at this unpropitious &s;ea&s;on of the year, as &s;he called it, &s;hrugging her &s;houlders, as it in compa&s;&s;ion for my ru&s;tic ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Good Lady! &s;he knew not that I am in company that want not entertainments out of them&s;elves. They have no time to kill, or to delude: On the contrary, our con&s;tant complaint is, that time flies too fa&s;t: And I am &s;ure, for my part, I am forced to be a manager of it; &s;ince, between conver&s;ation and writing, I have not a moment to &s;pare: And I never in my life devoted &s;o &s;ew hours to re&s;t.</P>
<P>I have often wi&s;hed for Mi&s;s Clements to be with us; and &s;o I told her: Sir Charles &s;poke very hand|&s;omely of her, on occa&s;ion of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's &s;ay|ing, &s;he was a plain, but good young woman. She is not a beauty, &s;aid he; but &s;he has qualities that are more admired than mere beauty.</P>
<P>Would &s;he not, a&s;ked Lady L. make a good wife for Lord W.? There is, &s;aid Sir Charles, too great a di&s;parity in years. She has, and mu&s;t have, too many hopes. My Lord W.'s wife will, probably, be confined &s;ix months, out of twelve, to a gouty man's chamber. She mu&s;t therefore be one who has outlived half her hopes: She mu&s;t have been acquainted with affliction, and known di&s;appointment. She mu&s;t con|&s;ider her marriage with him, tho' as an act of con|de&s;cen&s;ion, yet partly as a preferment. Her tender|ne&s;s will, by this means, be engaged; yet her dignity &s;upported: and if &s;he is not too much in years to bring my Lord an heir, he will then be the mo&s;t grateful of men to her.</P>
<P>My dear Brother, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, forgive me all my faults: Your actions, your &s;entiments, &s;hall
<PB N="132" REF="135">
be the rule of mine!&mdash;But who can come up to you? The Danby's&mdash;Lord W.&mdash;</P>
<P>Any-body may, Charlotte, interrupted Sir Charles, who will be guided by the well-known rule of <HI>Doing to others, as you would they &s;hould do unto you.</HI> Were you in the &s;ituation of the Danby's, of Lord W. would you not wi&s;h to be done by, as I have done, and intend to do, by them? What mu&s;t be tho&s;e who, with hungry eyes, wait and wi&s;h for the death of a relation? May they not be compared to &s;avages on the &s;ea-&s;hore, who look out impatiently for a wreck, in order to plunder and prey upon the &s;poils of the mi&s;erable? Lord W. has been long an unhappy man from want of principles: I &s;hall rojoice, if I can be a means of convincing him, by his own experience, that he was in a wrong cour&s;e, and of making his lat|ter days happy. Would I not, in <HI>my</HI> decline, wi&s;h for a nephew that had the &s;ame notions? And can I expect &s;uch an one, if I &s;et not the example?</P>
<P>Pretty &s;oon after &s;upper, Sir Charles left us; and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;eeing me in a re&s;verie, &s;aid, I will lay my life, Harriet, you fan&s;y my brother is gone up to read your Letters&mdash;Nay, you are in the right; for he whi&s;pered as much to me, before he withdrew. But do not be apprehen&s;ive, Harriet (for &s;he &s;aw me concerned); you have nothing to fear, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>Lady L. &s;aid, That her brother's notions and mine were exactly alike, on every &s;ubject: But yet, Lucy, when one knows one's cau&s;e to be under actual examination, one cannot but have &s;ome heart-akes.&mdash;Yet why?&mdash;If his favourite woman is a <HI>foreigner,</HI> what &s;ignifies his opinion of my Letters&mdash;And yet it does: One would be willing to be well thought of by the worthy.</P>

<P>WE &s;at down early to breakfa&s;t this morning: Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the attendants, as &s;oon as Sir Charles entered the room.</P>
<P>He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, the moment he &s;aw me: Admirable Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, what an enter|tainment have your Letters given me, down to a cer|tain period!&mdash;How, at, and after that, have they di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed me, for your &s;ufferings from a Savage!&mdash;It is well for him, and perhaps for me, that I &s;aw not &s;ooner this latter part of your affecting &s;tory: I have read thro' the whole parcel.</P>
<P>He took it from his bo&s;om, and, with a re&s;pectful air, pre&s;ented it to me&mdash;Ten thou&s;and thanks for the favour&mdash;I dare not hope for farther indulgence&mdash;Yet not to &s;ay, how de&s;irous I am&mdash;But, forgive me&mdash;Think me not too great an incroacher&mdash;</P>

<P>And &s;o, thought I, did your <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> Harriet, Sir.</P>
<P>Well, brother, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, and what are the <HI>faults?</HI></P>
<P>Faults! Charlotte.&mdash;Such a noble heart! &s;uch an amiable frankne&s;s! No prudery! No coquetry! Yet &s;o much, and &s;o ju&s;tly admired by as many as have had the happine&s;s to approach her!&mdash;Then, turning to me, I adore, madam, the goodne&s;s, the <HI>greatne&s;s</HI> of your heart.

<P>But I hope, Sir, &s;aid I, that you will correct&mdash;</P>
<P>You called upon me ye&s;terday, interrupted he, to attend to the debate between you and Mr. Walden: I think I have &s;omething to ob&s;erve upon that &s;ubject. I told you, that beauty &s;hould not bribe me. I have very few ob&s;ervations to make upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Will you give us, brother, your opinion, in writing, of what you have read? <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This &s;ubject is &s;poken to hereafter by Sir Charles.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> That would fill a volume: And it would be almo&s;t all panegyric.</P>
<P>How flattering&mdash;But <HI>this</HI> foreign Lady, Lucy!&mdash;</P>
<P>Lady L. began another &s;ubject.&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray, brother, &s;aid &s;he, let me revive one of the topics of ye&s;terday&mdash;Concerning Lord G. and Sir Walter Watkyns&mdash;And I hope you, Charlotte, will excu&s;e me.</P>

<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Then let me manage this article for my &s;i&s;ter. You &s;aid, brother, that you have engaged to give Lord G. either hope, or otherwi&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Lord G. was very earne&s;t with me for my intere&s;t with my &s;i&s;ter. I, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;he is now ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged, did undertake to let him know what room he had for hope, or if any; but told him, That I would not, by any means, endeavour to influ|ence her.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Charlotte is afraid, that you would not, of your&s;elf, from di&s;plea&s;ure, have revived the &s;ubject&mdash;Not that &s;he values&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="138">
There &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I might, at the time, be a little petulant: But I <HI>&s;hould</HI> have revived the &s;ubject, becau&s;e I had engaged my&s;elf to procure an an&s;wer for an ab&s;ent per&s;on, to a que&s;tion that was of the highe&s;t import|ance to him: But, perhaps, I &s;hould have entered in|to the &s;ubject with Charlotte when we were alone.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> She can have no objection, I believe, to let all of us, who are pre&s;ent, know her mind, on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> To be &s;ure I have not.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> What &s;ignifies mincing the matter? I undertook, at <HI>her</HI> de&s;ire, to recal the &s;ubject, becau&s;e you had &s;eemed to intere&s;t your&s;elf in it.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I think I know as much of Charlotte's mind already, from what you have hinted, Lady L. as I ought to be inqui&s;itive about.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> How &s;o, brother? What have I &s;aid?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> What meant the words you &s;topt at&mdash;<HI>Not that &s;he values?</HI> &mdash;Now, tho' I will not endeavour to lead her choice in behalf of a <HI>prince;</HI> yet would I be <HI>earne&s;t</HI> to oppo&s;e her marriage with a man for whom &s;he declaredly has no value.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> You are a little &s;udden upon me, Sir Charles.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> You mu&s;t not think the words you &s;topt at, Lady L. &s;light words: <HI>Principle,</HI> and Charlotte's future happine&s;s, and that of a worthy man, are con|cerned here. But perhaps you mean no more, than to give a little &s;pecimen of Lady-like pride in tho&s;e words. It is a very hard matter for women, on &s;uch occa&s;ions as the&s;e, to be ab&s;olutely right.&mdash;Dear Mi&s;s Byron, bowing to me, excu&s;e me&mdash;There is one Lady in the world that ought not, from what I have had the honour to &s;ee, on her <HI>own</HI> account, to take ami&s;s my freedom with her &s;ex, tho' &s;he perhaps will on <HI>that</HI> of tho&s;e &s;he loves.

for her &s;i&s;ter on this concerning &s;ubject, cannot help throwing in a &s;alvo for the pride of her &s;ex?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I doubt not, Sir, but Lady L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on will explain them&s;elves to your &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Lady L. then called upon her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Why, as to value&mdash;and all that&mdash;To be &s;ure&mdash;Lord G.&mdash;is not a man, that&mdash;(and &s;he looked round her on each per&s;on)&mdash;that a woman&mdash;Hem!&mdash;that a woman&mdash;But, brother, I think you are a little too ready&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;A word and a blow, as the &s;aying is, are two things.&mdash;Not that&mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt.</P>

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Good God! brother.</P>
<P>I was angry at him, in my mind. How came this <HI>good</HI> man, thought I, by &s;uch thoughts as the&s;e, of our &s;ex? What, Lucy, could a woman do with &s;uch a man, were he to apply to her in court&s;hip, whether &s;he denied or accepted of him?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> You will con&s;ider, Lady L. that you and Charlotte have brought this upon your&s;elves. <HI>That</HI> I call female pride, which di&s;tingui&s;hes not either time, company, or occa&s;ion. You will remember, that Lord G. is not <HI>here;</HI> we are <HI>all</HI> brothers and &s;i&s;ters: And why, Charlotte, do you approve of entering upon the &s;ubject in this company; yet come with your ex|ceptions, as if Lord G. had his father pre&s;ent, or plead|ing for him?

<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> With all my heart. I &s;tumbled at the very thre&s;hold. E'en, Charlotte, be your own ad|vocate. The cau&s;e is on.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Why, I don't know what to &s;ay.&mdash;My brother will be <HI>&s;o</HI> peremptory, perhaps&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> A good &s;ign for &s;omebody&mdash;Don't you think &s;o, madam? to me.&mdash;But the &s;nail will draw in its horns, if the finger ha&s;tily touch it&mdash;Come, <HI>no</HI> good &s;ign, perhaps, Charlotte.&mdash;I will <HI>not</HI> be peremp|tory.

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> This is charming!&mdash;But pray, Sir, What is your advice, on this &s;ubject?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> In our former conver&s;ation upon it, I told you what I thought of my Lord's good-humour; what of your vivacity&mdash;Can you, Charlotte, were you the wife of Lord G. content your&s;elf now-and-then to make him &s;tart, by the lancet-like delicacy of your wit, without going deeper than the &s;kin? Without expo&s;ing him (and your&s;elf for doing &s;o) to the ridi|cule of others? Can you bear with <HI>his</HI> &s;oibles, if he can bear with <HI>yours?</HI> And if the forbearance is greater on <HI>his</HI> &s;ide, than on <HI>yours,</HI> can you value him for it, and for his good-humour?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Finely run off, upon my word!</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I am afraid only, that you will be able, Charlotte, to do what you will with him. I am &s;orry to have cau&s;e to &s;ay, that I have &s;een very good women who have not known how to bear indulgence!&mdash;Waller was not ab&s;olutely wrong, as to <HI>&s;uch,</HI> when he &s;aid, "that women were born to be controuled." If controul is <HI>likely</HI> to be nece&s;&s;ary, it will be with women of &s;uch charming &s;pirits as you know who&s;e,

Charlotte, who will not confine to time and place their <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> agreeable vivacities.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Well, but, Sir, if it &s;hould chance to be &s;o, and I were Lord G.'s upper &s;ervant; for <HI>con|troul</HI> implies <HI>dominion;</HI> what a fine advantage would he have in a brother, who could direct him &s;o well (tho' he might &s;till, perhaps, be a bechelor) how to manage a wife &s;o flippant!</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Bachelors, Charlotte, are clo&s;e ob&s;ervers. It is not every married couple, if they were &s;ollicitous to have a bachelor marry, that &s;hould admit him into a very clo&s;e intimacy with them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> (archly) Pray, Lord L. Did we not once hear our <HI>cou&s;in Everard</HI> make an ob&s;ervation of this nature?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Fairly retorted, Charlotte!&mdash;But how <HI>came</HI> your cou&s;in Everard to make this ob&s;ervation? I once heard you &s;ay, that he was but a <HI>common</HI> ob|&s;erver. Every married pair is not Lord and Lady L.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Well, well, I believe married people mu&s;t do as well as they can. But may I a&s;k you, brother, Is it owing to &s;uch ob&s;ervations as tho&s;e you have been making, that you are now a &s;ingle man?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> A fair que&s;tion from you, Charlotte. I an&s;wer, It is not.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I &s;hould be glad, with all my heart, to know what is.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> When the &s;ubject comes fairly on the car|pet, your curio&s;ity may perhaps be gratified. But tell me, Do you intend that the &s;ubject you had engaged Lady L. to introduce, in relation to Lord G. and Sir Walter Watkyns, &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, at pre&s;ent? I mean not to be <HI>peremptory,</HI> Charlotte: Be not <HI>afraid</HI> to an&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Why that's kind. No, I can't &s;ay, that I do: And yet I frankly con&s;e&s;s, that I had much ra|ther <HI>a&s;k,</HI> than <HI>an&s;wer</HI> que&s;tions. You <HI>know,</HI> Sir, that I have a wicked curio&s;ity.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="142">
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Well, Charlotte, you will find me, wicked as you call it, very ready, at a proper time, to gratify it. To &s;ome things that you may want to know, in relation to my &s;ituation, you needed not now to have been a &s;tranger, had I had the plea&s;ure of being more with you, and had you your&s;elf been as explicit as I would have wi&s;hed you to be. But the cri&s;is is at hand. When I am certain my&s;elf, you &s;hall not be in doubt.

<P>See! Lucy. What can be gathered from all this? But yet this &s;peech has a noble &s;ound with it: Don't you think it has? It is, I think, worthy of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> No!&mdash;You did not hear it, Sir, if it will di&s;plea&s;e you. The whi&s;pers in conver&s;ation are no more to be heard, than the <HI>a&s;ides</HI> in a play.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Both the one and the other are wrong, Charlotte. Whi&s;perings in conver&s;ation are cen&s;u|rable, to a proverb: The <HI>a&s;ides,</HI> as you call them, and the &s;oliloquies, in a play, however frequent, are very poor (becau&s;e unnatural) &s;hifts of bungling authors, to make their performances intelligible to the au|dience.

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I think the man my brother &s;o much e&s;teems, mu&s;t be worth an hundred of &s;uch as tho&s;e we have ju&s;t now heard named.</P>

<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Very right. Pray, Sir Charles, don't let my &s;i&s;ter part with the <HI>two,</HI> without being &s;ure of a <HI>third.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Pray, Lord L. do you be quiet: Your &s;i&s;ter is in no hurry, I do a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> The female drawback again, Lady L.&mdash;<HI>Not that &s;he values.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible that Mi&s;s Byron can give offence.&mdash;Mr. Beauchamp is an excellent young man; about Five-and-twenty, not more: He is brave, learned, &s;incere, chearful; gentle in his manners, agreeable in his per&s;on.

<P>I only bowed, and I believe blu&s;hed with compla|cency, at the kind manner in which he &s;poke to me: Every one, by their eyes, took notice of it with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Well, brother, and what think you of the purport of Charlotte's que&s;tion? Charlotte &s;ays, That &s;he does not think highly of either of the other men.</P>

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Why that's the thing!&mdash;I was afraid it would come to this&mdash;Why, Sir, you mu&s;t tell him, I think&mdash;I profe&s;s I can't tell what&mdash;But, Sir, will

you let me know what you would have me tell him?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I will follow your lead as far as I can&mdash;Can you, do you think, love Lord G.?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Love him! love Lord G.? What a que|&s;tion is that!&mdash;Why no! I verily believe, that I can't &s;ay that.</P>
<P><HI>Sir. Ch.</HI> Can you e&s;teem him?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> E&s;teem!&mdash;Why that's a quaint word, tho' a <HI>female</HI> one. I believe, if I were to marry the hone&s;t man, I could be civil to him, if he would be very complai&s;ant, very ob&s;ervant, and all that&mdash;Pray, brother, don't, however, be angry with me.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I will not, Charlotte, &s;miling. It is <HI>con&s;ti|tution,</HI> you &s;ay.&mdash;But if <HI>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">u</HI> cannot be <HI>more</HI> than civil; and if <HI>he</HI> is to be very ob&s;ervant; you'll make it your agreement with him, before you meet him at the altar, that he &s;hall &s;ub&s;cribe to the woman's part of the vow; and that you &s;hall an&s;wer to the man's.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> A good thought, I believe! I'll con&s;i|der of it. If I find, in court&s;hip, the man will bear it, I may make the propo&s;al.&mdash;Yet I don't know, but it will be as well to <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> the vow changed, without <HI>conditioning</HI> for it, as other good women do; and act accordingly. One would not begin with a &s;ingu|larity, for fear of putting the par&s;on out. I heard an excellent Lady once advi&s;e a good wi&s;e, who, how|ever, very little wanted it, to give the man a hearing, and never do any thing that he would wi&s;h to be done, except &s;he cho&s;e to do it. If the man loves quiet, he'll be glad to compound.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Nay now, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, you are much more &s;evere upon your &s;ex, and upon matrimony, than Sir Charles.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Have I been &s;evere upon either, my dear Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Indeed I think &s;o.</P>

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Do as you plea&s;e, Sir.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> That is &s;aying nothing. Is there a man in the world you prefer to Lord G.?</P>

<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Help me, Lady L. You know, better than I, Charlotte's language: Help me to under&s;tand it.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> I believe, brother, you may let Lord G. know, that he will not be denied an audience, if he come&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> "Will not be denied an audience, if he come!" And this to Charlotte's brother! Women! Women!

<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> See, however, brother Grandi&s;on, this excellence in the two &s;i&s;ters! You &s;ay, indeed, but ju&s;t things in prai&s;e of Mi&s;s Byron; but <HI>they</HI> are more than women: For they <HI>enjoy</HI> that prai&s;e, and the acknowleged &s;uperiority of the only woman in Britain to whom they can be inferior.</P>
<P>Do you think I did not thank them both for com|pliments &s;o high? I did.</P>
<P>You DID, Harriet?</P>
<P>Ah, Lucy! I had a mind to &s;urpri&s;e you again. I <HI>did</HI> thank them; but it was in downca&s;t &s;ilence, and by a glow in my cheeks, that was even painful to me to feel.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="152">
The &s;i&s;ters have &s;ince ob&s;erved to me (flattering Ladies!) that their brother's eyes&mdash;But is it not &s;trange, Lucy, that they did not a&s;k him, in this long conver&s;ation, Whether his favourite of our &s;ex is a <HI>foreigner,</HI> or not? If &s;he be, what &s;ignifies the eye of plea&s;ure ca&s;t upon your Harriet?</P>
<P>But be this as it may, you &s;ee, Lucy, that the communicating of my Letters to Lord L. and the two Ladies, and of &s;ome of them to their brother, has rivetted the three fir&s;t in my favour, and done me honour with Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>But what do you think was Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's ad|dre&s;s to me, on this agreeable occa&s;ion? You, my grandmamma, will love her again, I am &s;ure, tho' &s;he &s;o lately incurred your di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Sweet and ever-amiable Harriet! &s;aid &s;he; Si&s;ter! Friend! enjoy the ju&s;t prai&s;es of two of the be&s;t of men!&mdash;You <HI>can</HI> enjoy them with equal mode&s;ty and dignity; and we can (What &s;ay <HI>you,</HI> Lady L.?) find our prai&s;e in the honour you do our &s;ex, and in being allowed to be &s;econds to you.</P>
<P>And what do you think was the an&s;wer of Lady L. (generous woman!) to this call of her &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>I can chearfully, &s;aid &s;he, &s;ub&s;cribe to the vi&s;ible &s;uperiority of my Harriet, as &s;hewn in all her Letters, as well as in her whole conduct: But then you, my Lord, and you, my brother, who in my eye are the fir&s;t of men, mu&s;t not let me have cau&s;e to dread, that your Caroline is &s;unk in yours.</P>
<P>I had hardly power to &s;it, yet had le&s;s to retire; as I had, for a moment, a thought to do. I am glad I did not attempt it: My return to company mu&s;t have been aukward, and made me look particular. But, Lucy, what is in my Letters, to de&s;erve all the&s;e fine &s;peeches?&mdash;But my Lord and his &s;i&s;ters are my true friends, and zealous well-wi&s;hers: No fear that I &s;hall be too proud, on this occa&s;ion. It is hum|bling enough to reflect, that the worthy three thought

it all no more than nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h me with &s;omebody; and yet, after all, if there be a <HI>foreign</HI> Lady&mdash;What &s;ignify all the&s;e fine things?</P>
<P>But how (you will a&s;k) did the brother acknowlege the&s;e generous &s;peeches of his &s;i&s;ters and Lord L?&mdash;How? Why as he ought to do. He gave them for their generous goodne&s;s to their Harriet, in preference to them&s;elves, &s;uch due prai&s;es, as more than re&s;tored them, in my eye, to the &s;uperiority they had &s;o nobly given up.</P>
<P>Sir Charles afterwards addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me jointly with his &s;i&s;ters: I &s;ee, with great plea&s;ure, &s;aid he, the happy under&s;tanding that there is between you three Ladies: It is a demon&s;tration, to me, of &s;urpa&s;&s;ing goodne&s;s in you all. To expre&s;s my&s;elf in the words of an ingenious man, to who&s;e works your &s;ex, and if <HI>yours, ours,</HI> are more obliged, than to tho&s;e of any &s;ingle man in the Briti&s;h world,

<L>Demand alliance, and in friend&s;hip burn.</L></Q></P>
<P>The two &s;i&s;ters and your Harriet bowed as they &s;at.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this happy under&s;tanding among you, let me hope, proceeded he, that <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s Byron, will be &s;o good as to inform your-<HI>&s;elf,</HI> and let <HI>me</HI> know, what I may certainly depend upon to be <HI>our</HI> Charlotte's inclinations with re&s;pect to the two gentle|men who court her favour; and whether there is any man that the <HI>can</HI> or <HI>does</HI> prefer to the mo&s;t favoured of either of them. From <HI>you</HI> I &s;hall not meet with the "Not that &s;he values."&mdash;The depreciating indif|ferences, the affected &s;lights, the <HI>female circumam|bages,</HI> if I may be allowed the words; the coldly|expre&s;&s;ed con&s;ent to vi&s;its not de&s;erving to be di&s;cou|raged, and perhaps not <HI>intended</HI> to be &s;o, that I have had to encounter with in the pa&s;t conver&s;ation. I have been exceedingly diverted with my &s;i&s;ter's vivacity: But as the affair is of a very &s;erious nature; as I would

be extremely tender in my interpo&s;ition, having really no choice but hers; and wanting only to know on whom that choice will fall, or whether on <HI>any</HI> man, at pre&s;ent; on <HI>your</HI> noble frankne&s;s I can rely; and Charlotte will open her mind to you: If not, &s;he has very little profited by the example you have &s;et her in the Letters you have permitted her to read.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e, bowed, and withdrew; Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on called after him, Brother, brother, brother&mdash;One word&mdash;Don't leave us&mdash;But he only ki&s;&s;ed his hand to us at the door; and bowing, with a &s;miling air, left us looking at each other in a &s;ilence that held a few moments.</P>

<P>At afternoon-tea, the Danby's being mentioned, Lord L. a&s;ked Sir Charles, What was the danger from which he relieved their uncle? And we all joining in reque&s;ting particulars he gave the following, which I will endeavour to repeat, as near as po&s;&s;ible, in his own words. My heart intere&s;ted it&s;elf in the relation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Mr. Danby, &s;aid he, was a merchant of equal eminence and integrity: He was &s;ettled at Cambray: He had great dealings in the manufactures of cam|bricks and lace. His brother John, a very profligate man, had demanded of him, and took it ill that he denied him, a thou&s;and guineas; for no better rea|&s;on, but becau&s;e he had generou&s;ly given that &s;um to each of the wicked man's children. Surely, he pleaded, he was as nearly related to his brother as were tho&s;e his children. No plea is too weak for folly and &s;elf-intere&s;t to in&s;i&s;t upon. Yet my Mr. Danby had often given this brother large &s;ums, which he &s;quandered away almo&s;t as &s;oon as he re|ceived them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'My father u&s;ed to make remittances to Mr. Danby, for my u&s;e: for his dealings in other branches of commerce extended to the &s;outh of France and Italy: This brought me acquainted with him.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He took a great liking to me. I &s;aw him fir&s;t at
<PB N="153" REF="156">
Lyons; and he engaged me to vi&s;it him at Cam|bray, whenever I &s;hould go to Paris or Flanders.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Accompanying a friend, &s;oon after, to Paris, I performed my promi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He had a villa in the Cambre&s;is, at a &s;mall di|&s;tance from the city, which he &s;ometimes called his <HI>cottage,</HI> at others his <HI>dormitory.</HI> It was a little lone hou&s;e: He valued it for its elegance. Thither, after I had pa&s;&s;ed two days with him at his hou&s;e in the city, he carried me.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'His brother, enraged at being refu&s;ed the &s;um he had &s;o unrea&s;onably demanded, formed a plot to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his whole fortune. My Mr. Danby was a bachelor, and, it was known, had, to that time, an aver&s;ion to the thought of making his will.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The wretch, in &s;hort, hired three ruffians to murder him. The attempt was to be made in this little hou&s;e, that the fact might have the appearance of being perpetrated by robbers; and the cabinets in the bed-chamber, if there were time for it, after the horrid fact was perpetrated, were to be broken open, and rifled, in order to give credit to that ap|pearance. The villains were each to be rewarded with a thou&s;and crowns, payable on the wicked man's getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his brother's fortune; and they had fifty crowns apiece paid them in hand. Their unnatural employer waited the event at Ca|lais, tho' he told them he &s;hould be at Dunkirk.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I had one &s;ervant with me, who lay with a man|&s;ervant of Mr. Danby in a little room over the &s;table, about an hundred yards from the hou&s;e. There were only conveniences in the hou&s;e for Mr. Danby and a friend, be&s;ides two women &s;ervants in the upper part of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'About midnight I was alarmed by a noi&s;e, as of violence u&s;ed at the window of Mr. Danby's room. Mine communicated with his. The fa&s;tening of the

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I &s;lipt on my cloaths in an in&s;tant, and, drawing my &s;word, ru&s;hed into the next room, ju&s;t as one villain, with a large knife in his hand, had &s;eized the throat of Mr. Danby, who, till then, was in a &s;ound &s;leep. The &s;kin of his neck, and one hand li&s;ted up to defend him&s;elf, were &s;lightly wounded before I ran the ruffian into the &s;houlder, as I did with my &s;word, and in the &s;ame moment di&s;armed him, and threw him, with violence from the bed, again&s;t the door. He roared out, that he was a dead man.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A &s;econd fellow had got up to the window, and was half in: He called out, to a third below, to ha&s;ten up after him on a ladder, which was gene|rally left in an outhou&s;e near the little garden.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I ha&s;tened to this &s;econd fellow, who then fired a pi&s;tol, but happily mi&s;&s;ed me; and who, feeling my &s;word's point in his arm, threw him&s;elf, with a little of my help, out of the window, upon the third fellow, who was mounting the ladder, and knocked him off: And then both made their e&s;cape by the way they came.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The fellow within had fainted, and lay weltering in his blood.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'By this time, the two women-&s;ervants had let in our men, who had been alarmed by the report of the pi&s;tol, and by the report of the pi&s;tol, and by the &s;creams of the women from their window; for they ventured not out of their chamber till they were called upon for entrance, by their fellow-&s;ervant from below.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The two footmen, by my direction, bound up the ruffian's &s;houlder: They dragged him down into the hall: He &s;oon came to him&s;elf, and offered to make an ample confe&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Poor Mr. Danby had crept into my room, and in

<P>We were about to deliver our &s;entiments on this extraordinary event, when Sir Charles, turning to Lady L. Let me a&s;k you, &s;aid he, the &s;ervant being withdrawn, Has Charlotte found out her own mind?</P>
<P>Yes, yes, Sir; I believe &s;he has opened all her heart to Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>Then I &s;hall know more of it in ten minutes, than Charlotte would let me know in as many hours.</P>
<P>Stand by, every-body, &s;aid the humorous Lady&mdash;Let me get up, and make my brother one of my be&s;t courte&s;ies.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was ju&s;t then called out to a me&s;&s;enger, who brought him Letters from town. He returned to us, his complexion heightened, and a little di&s;com|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>I intended, madam, &s;aid he, to me, to have craved the honour of your company for half an hour in my Lord's library, on the &s;ubject we were talking of: But the&s;e Letters require my immediate attention. The me&s;&s;enger mu&s;t return with my an&s;wer to two of

them, early in the morning. You will have the good|ne&s;s, looking round him, to di&s;pen&s;e with my attend|ance on you at &s;upper. But perhaps, madam, to me, you will be &s;o good, as, in one word, to &s;ay, No, or Yes, for Charlotte.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> What, Sir to be <HI>given up</HI> without a preface!&mdash;I beg your pardon. <HI>Le&s;s</HI> than <HI>ten words</HI> &s;hall not do, I a&s;&s;ure you, tho' from my &s;i&s;ter Har|riet.</P>

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Or Lord G.&mdash;I have not &s;aid which. Would you have my poor Lord rejected by a &s;lighting mono&s;yllable only?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Mad girl!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Why, Lady L. don't you &s;ee that Sir Charles wants to take me by <HI>implication?</HI> But my Lord G. is neither &s;o &s;oon lo&s;t, nor Charlotte &s;o ea&s;ily won. Harriet, if <HI>you</HI> would give up your&s;elf at a fir&s;t que&s;tion, then I will excu&s;e you if you give up <HI>me</HI> as ea&s;ily, but not el&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> If Sir Charles thinks a conference upon the &s;ubject unnece&s;&s;ary&mdash;Pray don't let us give him the trouble of holding one. His time, you &s;ee, is very precious.</P>
<P>Can you gue&s;s, Lucy, at the humour I was in when I &s;aid this?&mdash;If you think it was a very good one, you are mi&s;taken; yet I was &s;orry for it after|wards. Fooli&s;h &s;elf-betrayer! Why &s;hould I &s;eem to wi&s;h for a conference with him? But that was not all&mdash;To be petulant with &s;uch a one, when his heart was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; for &s;o it proved: But he was too po|lite, too great, &s;hall I &s;ay? to take notice of my pe|tulance. How little does it make me in my own eyes!</P>
<P>Had I, &s;aid he, ever &s;o ea&s;ily obtained a knowlege of my &s;i&s;ter's mind, I &s;hould not have known how to depend upon it, were it not &s;trengthened, madam,
<PB N="157" REF="160">
from your lips. The conference, therefore, which you gave me hopes you would favour me with, would have been ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. I hope Mi&s;s Byron will allow me to invite her to it to-morrow morning. The intended &s;ubject of it is a very &s;erious one with me. My &s;i&s;ter's happine&s;s, and that of a man not unworthy, are concerned in it, lightly as Charlotte has hitherto treated it. He bowed and was going.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Nay, pray, brother&mdash;You mu&s;t not leave me in anger.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I do not, Charlotte. I had rather bear with you, than you &s;hould with me. I &s;ee you can|not help it. A lively heart is a great ble&s;&s;ing. Indulge it. Now is your time.</P>
<P>Dear doctor, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, when Sir Charles was gone out, What can be the meaning of my bro|ther's gravity? It alarms me.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> If goodne&s;s, madam, would make an heart lively, Sir Charles's would be as lively as your own; but you might have perceived by his air, when he en|tered, that the letters brought him affected him too much to permit him to laugh off a light an&s;wer to a &s;erious que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Dear doctor!&mdash;But I do now recollect, that he entered with &s;ome little di&s;compo&s;ure on his countenance. How could I be &s;o inattentive?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> And I, too, I doubt, was a little captious.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> A <HI>very</HI> little. Pardon me, madam.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in the excellent man.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, I could wi&s;h to a&s;k you one que&s;tion, &s;aid he.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You are angry with me brother.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> No, my dear!&mdash;But I am afraid I with|drew with too grave an air. I have been a thou&s;and times plea&s;ed with you, Charlotte, to one time di&s;|plea&s;ed; and when I have been the latter, you have always known it: I had &s;omething in my hand that ruffled me a little.

I wanted to &s;ay a few words to my good Dr. Bartlett: And, to &s;ay truth, being con&s;cious that I had departed a little abruptly, I could not be ea&s;y till I apologized in per&s;on for it; therefore came to <HI>a&s;k</HI> the favour of the doctor's ad|vice, rather than <HI>reque&s;t</HI> it by me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The doctor and he withdrew together.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;mall in&s;tances, &s;aid my Lord, are the cha|racters of the heart di&s;played, far more than in greater. What excellence &s;hines out in full lu&s;tre, on this un|affected and &s;eemingly little occa&s;ion! Fear of offend|ing; of giving unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;ollicitude to remove doubts; patience recommended in one &s;hort &s;entence, more forcibly than &s;ome would have done it in a long di&s;|cour&s;e, as well as by example; cen&s;uring him&s;elf, not from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being wrong, but of being <HI>taken</HI> wrong. Ah! my dear &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, we &s;hould all edify by &s;uch an example&mdash;But I &s;ay no more.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> And have <HI>you</HI> nothing to &s;ay, Har|riet?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Very little, &s;ince I have been much to blame my&s;elf: Yet let me remind my Charlotte, that her brother was di&s;plea&s;ed with her ye&s;terday, for trea|ting too lightly a &s;ubject he had engaged in &s;eriou&s;ly; and that he has been forced to refer to her friend, rather than to her&s;elf, to help him to the knowlege of her mind. O Charlotte! regret you not the occa&s;ion given for the expedient? And do you not [Yes, I &s;ee you do] blu&s;h for giving it? Yet to &s;ee him come vo|luntarily back, when he had left us in a grave humour, for fear the babies &s;hould think him angry with them; O how great is he! and how little are we!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Your &s;ervant, &s;i&s;ter Harriet!&mdash;You have made a <HI>dainty</HI> &s;peech, I think: But, great and good as my brother is, we know how it comes to pa&s;s, that your pretty imagination is always at work to aggran|dize the man, and to lower the babies!</P>
<PB N="159" REF="162">
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I will not &s;ay another word on the &s;ub|ject. You are not generous, Charlotte.</P>
<P>She took my hand: Forgive me, my dear&mdash;I touch'd too tender a &s;tring. Then turning to Mi&s;s Jervois, and with the other hand taking hers, Why twinkles thus my girl?&mdash;I charge you, Emily, tell me all you think.</P>
<P>I am thinking, &s;aid &s;he, that my guardian is not happy. To &s;ee him bear with every-body; to have him keep all his troubles to him&s;elf, becau&s;e he would not afflict any-body, and yet &s;tudy to lighten and re|move the troubles of every-body el&s;e&mdash;Did he not &s;ay, that he &s;hould be happy, but for the unhappine&s;s of other people?</P>
<P>Excellent young creature! &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: I love you every day better and better. For the future, my dear, do not retire, whatever &s;ubjects we talk of. I &s;ee, that we may confide in your di&s;cretion. But well as you love your guardian, &s;ay nothing to him of what women talk to women. My Lord L. is an ex|ception, in <HI>this</HI> ca&s;e: He is one of us.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> O Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! what a mix'd cha|racter is yours! How good you can be, when you plea&s;e! and how naughty!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Well, and you like me, ju&s;t now?&mdash;That's the beauty of it; to offend and make up, at plea&s;ure. Old Terence was a &s;hrewd man: The fall|ing out of Lovers, &s;ays he (as Lord L. once quoted him), is the renewal of Love. Are we not now bet|ter friends, than if we had never differed? And do you think that I will not, if I marry, exerci&s;e my hu&s;band's patience now-and-then for this very pur|po&s;e?&mdash;Let <HI>me</HI> alone, Harriet: Now a quarrel; now a reconciliation; I warrant I &s;hall be happier than any of the yawning &s;ee-&s;aws in the kingdom. Everla&s;t|ing <HI>&s;ummers</HI> would be a grievance.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> You may be right, if you are exceeding <HI>di&s;creet</HI> in your perver&s;ene&s;&s;es, Charlotte; and yet if
<PB N="160" REF="163">
you <HI>are,</HI> you will not lay out for a quarrel, I fan&s;y. The world, or you will have better luck than your brother &s;eems to have had, will find you opportunities enow, for exerci&s;ing the tempers of both, without your needing to &s;tudy for occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr. Study</HI> for them, Harriet! I &s;ha'n't &s;tudy for them, neither: They will come of cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I was about to a&s;k a que&s;tion&mdash;But 'tis better let alone.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I <HI>will</HI> have it. What was your que|&s;tion? Don't you &s;ee what a good-natured fool I am? You may &s;ay any-thing to me: I won't be angry.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I was going to a&s;k you, If you were ever concernd two hours together, for any fault you ever committed in your life?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Yes, yes, yes; and for two-and-twenty hours: For &s;ometimes the inconveniencies that fol|lowed my errors, were not pre&s;ently over, as in a certain ca&s;e, which I'll be hang'd if you have not in your head, with that fly leer that &s;hews the rogue in your heart: But when I got rid of con&s;equences, no bird in &s;pring was ever more blyth.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday, March <HI>24.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE conference, the impatiently expected con|ference, my Lucy, is over: And what is the re&s;ult?&mdash;Take the account of it, as it was brought on, proceeded with, and concluded. Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on and her Lovers were not our only &s;ubjects. I will &s;oon be with you, my dear.&mdash;But I'll try to be as mi|nute as I u&s;ed to be, notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding what?&mdash;</P>
<P>You &s;hall hear, Lucy.</P>
<P>Sir Charles gave us his company at breakfa&s;t. He entered with a kind of benign &s;olemnity in his coun|tenance, but the benignity increa&s;ed, and the &s;olem|nity went off, after a little while.</P>
<P>My Lord &s;aid, he was very &s;orry that he had met with any-thing to di&s;turb him, in the Letters that were brought him ye&s;terday. Emily joined by her eyes; tho' not in &s;peech, her concern with his Lord&s;hip's: Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on was &s;edately &s;erious: Lady L. had expectation in her fine face; and Dr. Bartlett &s;at like a man that was determined to be &s;ilent. I had appre|hen&s;ion, and hope, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;truggling in mine, as I knew not whether to wi&s;h for the expected confe|rence, or not; my cheeks, as I felt, in a glow.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="165">
Let us think of nothing, my Lord, in this com|pany, &s;aid he, but what is agreeable.</P>
<P>He enquired kindly of my health and la&s;t night's re&s;t, becau&s;e of a &s;light cold that had affected my voice: Of Emily, Why &s;he was &s;o &s;ad? Of Lady L. and my Lord, When they went to town? Of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, Why &s;he looked &s;o <HI>meditatingly?</HI> that was his word&mdash;Don't you &s;ee, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid he, that Charlotte looks as if &s;he had not quite &s;ettled the humour &s;he intends to be in for the next half-hour?</P>
<P>Charlotte looks, I believe, Sir, replied &s;he, as if &s;he were determined to take her humour for the next half-hour from yours, whether grave, or airy.</P>
<P>Then, returned he, I will not be grave, becau&s;e I will not have you &s;o.&mdash;May I hope, madam, by-and-by, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, for the honour of your hand, to my Lord's library?</P>
<P>Sir, I will&mdash;I will&mdash;attend you&mdash;he&s;itated the &s;im|pleton, but &s;he can't tell how &s;he looked.</P>
<P>Thus, Lucy, was the matter brought on.</P>
<P>He conducted me to my Lord's library.&mdash;How did I &s;truggle with my&s;elf for pre&s;ence of mind! What a mixture was there of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect, in his countenance and air!</P>
<P>He &s;eated me; then took his place over-again&s;t me&punc; I believe I looked down, and con&s;cious, and &s;illy; but there was &s;uch a re&s;pectful mode&s;ty in his looks, that one could not be unea&s;y at being now and then with an air of languor, as I thought, contemplated by him: E&s;pecially as, whenever I reared my eye-lids to ca&s;t a momentary look at him as he &s;poke, I was al|ways &s;ure to &s;ee his eye withdrawn: This gave more freedom to mine, than it po&s;&s;ibly otherwi&s;e could have had. What a bold creature, Lucy, ought <HI>&s;he</HI> to be, who prefers a bold man! If &s;he be <HI>not</HI> bold, how &s;illy mu&s;t &s;he look under his &s;taring confident eye! How mu&s;t <HI>her</HI> want of courage add to <HI>his!</HI> and, of cour&s;e, to his &s;elf-con&s;equence!</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="166">
Thus he began the &s;ubject we were to talk of.</P>
<P>I will make no apology for reque&s;ting the favour of this conference with one of the mo&s;t frank and open-hearted young Ladies in the world: I &s;hall have the honour, perhaps, of detaining your ear on <HI>more</HI> than one &s;ubject [How my heart throbbed!] But that which I &s;hall begin with, relates to my Lord G. and <HI>our</HI> &s;i&s;ter Charlotte. I ob&s;erve, from hints thrown out by her&s;elf, as well as from what Lady L. &s;aid, that &s;he intends to encourage his addre&s;&s;es; but it is ea&s;y to &s;ee, that &s;he thinks but &s;lightly of him. I am in|deed apprehen&s;ive, that &s;he is rather induced to favour my Lord, from an opinion that he has my intere&s;t and good wi&s;hes, than from her own inclination. I have told her, more than once, that her's are, and &s;hall be, mine: But &s;uch is her vivacity, that it is very difficult for me to know her real mind. I take it for granted, that &s;he prefers my Lord to Sir Walter.</P>
<P>I believe, Sir&mdash;But why &s;hould I &s;ay <HI>believe,</HI> when Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on has <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned</HI> me to own, that Lord G. is a man whom &s;he greatly prefers to Sir Walter Watkyns.</P>
<P>Does &s;he, <HI>can</HI> &s;he, do you think, madam, prefer Lord G. not only to Sir Walter, but to all the men whom &s;he at pre&s;ent knows? In other words, Is there <HI>any</HI> man that you think &s;he would prefer to Lord G.? I am extremely &s;ollicitous for my &s;i&s;ter's happine&s;s; and the more, becau&s;e of her vivacity, which, I am afraid, will be thought le&s;s to become the wife, than the &s;ingle woman.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, Sir, that if Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on thought of any other man in preference to Lord G. &s;he would not encourage his addre&s;&s;es, upon any account.</P>
<P>I don't expect, madam, that a woman of Char|lotte's &s;pirit and vivacity, who has been di&s;appointed by a &s;ailure of &s;uppo&s;ed merit in her fir&s;t Love (if we may &s;o call it), &s;hould be deeply in love with a man that has not <HI>very</HI> &s;triking qualities. She can play
<PB N="164" REF="167">
with a flame now, and not burn her fingers. Lord G. is a worthy, tho' not a very brilliant man. Ladies have eyes; and the eye expects to be gratified. Hence men of appearance &s;ucceed often, where men of in|trin&s;ic merit fail. Were Charlotte to con&s;ult her hap|pine&s;s, po&s;&s;ibly &s;he would have no objection to Lord G. She cannot, in the &s;ame man, have every-thing. But if Lord G. con&s;ulted <HI>his,</HI> I don't know whether he would wi&s;h for Charlotte. Excu&s;e me, madam; you have heard, as well as &s;he, my opinion of both men. Sir Walter, you &s;ay, has no part in the que|&s;tion; Lord G. wants not under&s;tanding: He is a man of probity; he is a virtuous man; a quality not to be de&s;pi&s;ed in a young nobleman: He is al&s;o a mild man: He will bear a great deal. But contempt, or &s;uch a behaviour as &s;hould look like contempt, in a wife, what hu&s;band can bear? I &s;hould much more dread, for her &s;ake, the exa&s;perated &s;pirit of a meek man, than the &s;udden gu&s;ts of anger of a pa&s;&s;ionate one.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, Sir, has authorized me to &s;ay, That if you approve of Lord G.'s addre&s;&s;es, and will be &s;o good as to take upon your&s;elf the direction of every-thing relating to &s;ettlements, &s;he will be entirely govern'd by you. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, Sir, has known Lord G. &s;ome time: His good character is well known: And I dare an&s;wer, that &s;he will acquit her|&s;elf with honour and prudence, in <HI>every</HI> engagement, but more e&s;pecially in that which is the highe&s;t of all worldly ones.</P>
<P>Pray, madam, may I a&s;k, If you know what &s;he could mean by the que&s;tions &s;he put in relation to Mr. Beauchamp? I think &s;he has never &s;een him. Does &s;he &s;uppo&s;e, from his character, that &s;he could prefer him to Lord G.?</P>
<P>I believe, Sir, what &s;he &s;aid in relation to that gen|tleman, was purely the effect of her vivacity, and which &s;he never thought of before, and probably,
<PB N="165" REF="168">
never will again. Had &s;he meant any-thing by it, I dare &s;ay, &s;he would not have put the que&s;tions about him in the manner &s;he did.</P>
<P>I believe &s;o. I love my &s;i&s;ter, and I love my friend. Mr. Beauchamp has delicacy. I could not bear, for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake, that, were &s;he to behold him in the light hinted at, he &s;hould imagine he had rea&s;on to think &s;lightly of my &s;i&s;ter, for the corre&s;pondence &s;he car|ried on, in &s;o private a manner, with a man ab&s;olutely unworthy of her. But I hope &s;he meant nothing, but to give way to that vein of raillery, which, when opened, &s;he knows not always how to &s;top.</P>
<P>My &s;pirits were not high: I was forced to take out my handkerchief&mdash;O my dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! &s;aid I, I was <HI>afraid</HI> &s;he had forfeited, partly, at lea&s;t, what &s;he holds mo&s;t dear, the good opinion of her brother!</P>
<P>Forgive me, madam; 'tis a generous pain that I have made you &s;uffer: I adore you for it. But I think I can reveal all the &s;ecrets of my heart to you. Your noble frankne&s;s calls for equal frankne&s;s: You would in&s;pire it, where it is not. My &s;i&s;ter, as I told her more than once in your hearing, has not lo&s;t any of my love. I love her, with all her faults; but mu&s;t not be blind to them. Shall not prai&s;e and di&s;prai&s;e be ju&s;tly given? I have faults, great faults, my&s;elf: What &s;hould I think of the man who called them virtues? How dangerous would it be to me, in that ca&s;e, were my opinion of his judgment, joined to &s;elf|partiality, to lead me to believe him, and acquit my &s;elf?</P>
<P>This, Sir, is a manner of thinking worthy of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>It is worthy of every man, my good Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>But, Sir, it would be very hard, that an indi&s;cre|tion (I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> own it to be &s;uch) &s;hould fa&s;ten reproach upon a woman who recovered her&s;elf &s;o &s;oon, and who&s;e virtue was never &s;ullied, or in danger.</P>
<P>Indeed it would: And therefore it was in tender|ne&s;s
<PB N="166" REF="169">
to her that I intimated, that I never could think of promoting an alliance with a man of his nice no|tions, were <HI>both</HI> to incline to it.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, that my dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on will run no ri&s;que of being &s;lighted, by any <HI>other</HI> man&punc; from a &s;tep which has co&s;t her &s;o dear in her peace of mind&mdash;I he&s;itated, and looked down.</P>
<P>I know, madam, what you mean. Altho' I love my friend Beauchamp above all men, yet would I do Lord G. or any other man, as much ju&s;tice, as I would do him. I was &s;o apprehen&s;ive of my &s;i&s;ter's indiffer|ence to Lord G. and of the difference in their tem|pers, tho' both good, that I did my utmo&s;t to di&s;&s;uade him from thinking of her: And when I found that his love was fixed beyond the power of di&s;&s;ua&s;ion, I told him of the affair between her and Captain An|der&s;on; and how lately I had put an end to it. He flattered him&s;elf, that the indifference, with which &s;he had hitherto received his addre&s;&s;es, was principally owing to the difficulty of her &s;ituation; which being now &s;o happily removed, he had hopes of meeting with encouragement; and doubted not, if he did, of making a merit with her, by his affection and grati|tude. And now, madam, give me your opinion&mdash;Do you think Charlotte can be won (I hope &s;he can) by indulgence, by Love? Let me caution her by you, madam, that it is fit &s;he &s;hould &s;till <HI>more</HI> re&s;train her|&s;elf, if &s;he marry a man to whom &s;he thinks &s;he has &s;uperior talents, than &s;he need do if the difference were in his favour.</P>
<P>Permit me to add, That if &s;he &s;hould &s;hew her&s;elf capable of returning &s;light for tenderne&s;s; of taking <HI>&s;uch</HI> liberties with a man who loves her, after &s;he had given him her vows, as &s;hould depreciate him, and, of con&s;equence, <HI>her&s;elf,</HI> in the eye of the world; I &s;hould be apt to forget that I had more than <HI>one</HI> &s;i&s;ter: For, in ca&s;es of right and wrong, we ought not to know either relation or friend.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="170">
Does not this man, Lucy, &s;hew us, that goodne&s;s and greatne&s;s are &s;ynonymous words?</P>
<P>I think, Sir, replied I, that if Lord G. prove the good-natured man he &s;eems to be; if he di&s;like not that brilliancy of temper in his <HI>Lady,</HI> which he &s;eems not to value <HI>him&s;elf</HI> upon, tho' he may have qualities, at lea&s;t, <HI>equally</HI> valuable; I have no doubt but Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on will make him very happy: For has &s;he not great and good qualities? Is &s;he not generous, and perfectly good natured? You know, Sir, that &s;he is. And can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that her charming viva|city will ever carry her &s;o far beyond the bounds of prudence and di&s;cretion, as to make her forget what the nature of the obligation &s;he will have entered in|to, requires of her?</P>
<P>Well, madam, then I may rejoice the heart of Lord G. by telling him, that he is at liberty to vi&s;it my &s;i&s;ter, at her coming to town: or, if &s;he come not &s;oon (for he will be impatient to wait on her) at Colnebrooke?</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay you may, Sir.</P>
<P>As to articles and &s;ettlements, I will undertake for all tho&s;e things: But be plea&s;ed to tell her, that &s;he is ab&s;olutely at her own liberty, for me. If &s;he &s;hall think, when &s;he &s;ees farther of Lord G.'s temper and behaviour, that &s;he cannot e&s;teem him as a wife ought to e&s;teem her hu&s;band; I &s;hall not be concerned, if &s;he di&s;mi&s;s him; provided that &s;he keeps him not on in &s;u&s;pence, after &s;he knows her own mind; but be|haves to him according to the example &s;et her by the be&s;t of women.</P>
<P>I could not but know to whom he de&s;igned this compliment; and had like to have bowed, but was glad I did not.</P>
<P>Well, madam, and now I think this &s;ubject is concluded. I have already written a Letter to Sir Wal|ter, as at the reque&s;t of my &s;i&s;ter, to put an end, in the civille&s;t terms, to his hopes. My Lord G. will be
<PB N="168" REF="171">
impatient for my return to town. I &s;hall go with the more plea&s;ure, becau&s;e of the joy I &s;hall be able to give <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t be very happy, Sir, &s;ince, be&s;ides the plea&s;ure you take in doing good for its own &s;ake, you are intitled to partake, in a very high manner, of the plea&s;ures of every one you know.</P>
<P>He was &s;o nobly mode&s;t, Lucy, that I could talk to him with more confidence than, I believed, at my entrance into my Lord's &s;tudy, would fall to my &s;hare: And I had, be&s;ides, been led into a pre&s;ence of mind, by being made a per&s;on of &s;ome con&s;equence in the Love-ca&s;e of another: But I was &s;oon to have my whole attention engaged in a &s;ubject &s;till nearer to my heart; as you &s;hall hear.</P>
<P>Indeed, madam, &s;aid he, I am not <HI>very</HI> happy in my&s;elf. Is it not right then, to endeavour, by pro|moting the happine&s;s of others, to intitle my&s;elf to a &s;hare of theirs?</P>
<P>If <HI>you</HI> are not happy, Sir&mdash;and I &s;topt. I believe &s;ighed; I looked down: I took out my handkerchief, for fear I &s;hould want it.</P>
<P>There &s;eems, &s;aid he, to be a mixture of generous concern, and kind curio&s;ity, in one of the lovelie&s;t and mo&s;t intelligent faces in the world. My &s;i&s;ters have, in your pre&s;ence, expre&s;&s;ed a great deal of the latter. Had I not been my&s;elf in a manner uncer|tain, as to the event that mu&s;t, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, go|vern my future de&s;tiny, I would have gratified it, e&s;|pecially as my Lord L. has, of late, joined in it. The cri&s;is, I told them, however, as perhaps you remem|ber, was at hand.</P>
<P>I do remember you &s;aid &s;o, Sir. And indeed, Lucy, it was <HI>more</HI> than <HI>perhaps.</HI> I had not thought of any words half &s;o often, &s;ince he &s;poke them.</P>
<P>The cri&s;is, madam, <HI>is</HI> at hand: And I had not in|tended to open my lips upon the &s;ubject till it was over, except to Dr. Bartlett, who knows the whole

<HEAD><HI>LETTER XX.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not intend, madam, to trouble you with an hi&s;tory of all that part of my life which I was obliged to pa&s;s abroad from about the Seventeenth to near the Twenty-fifth year of my age; tho' perhaps it has been as bu&s;y a period as could well be, in the life of a man &s;o young, and who never &s;ought to trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> in oblique or crooked paths. After this en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rance into it, Dr. Bartlett &s;hall be at liberty to &s;atisfy your cu|rio&s;ity in a more <HI>particular</HI> manner; for he and I have corre&s;ponded for years with an intim cy that has few examples between a youth and a man in ad|vanced life. And here let me own the advantage&punc; I have received from his conde&s;cen&s;ion; for I found the following que&s;tions often occur to me, and to be of the highe&s;t &s;ervice in the conduct of my life&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'What
<PB N="170" REF="173">
account &s;hall I give of this to Dr. Bartlett?'</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'How, were I to give way to <HI>this</HI> temptation, &s;hall I re|port it to Dr. Bartlett?'&mdash;Or, 'Shall I be an hypo|crite, and only inform him of the be&s;t, and meanly conceal from him the wor&s;t?'</Q></P>
<P>Thus, madam, was Dr. Bartlett in the place of a &s;econd con&s;cience to me: And many a good thing did I do, many a bad one avoid, for having &s;et up &s;uch a monitor over my conduct. And it was the more nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould, as I am naturally pa&s;&s;ionate, proud, ambitious: and as I had the honour of being early di&s;tingui&s;hed (Pardon, madam, the &s;eeming va|nity) by a &s;ex, of which no man was ever a greater admirer; and, po&s;&s;ibly, the <HI>more</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed, as, for my &s;afety-&s;ake, I was as &s;tudious to decline intimacy with the gay ones of it, however dignified by rank, or celebrated for beauty, as mo&s;t young men are to cultivate their favour.</P>
<P>Nor is it &s;o much to be wondered at, that I had advantages which every-one who travels, has not. Re&s;iding for &s;ome time at the principal courts, and often vi&s;iting the &s;ame places, in the length of time I was abroad, I was con&s;idered, in a manner, as a na|tive, at the &s;ame time, that I was treated with the re|&s;pect that is generally paid to travellers of figure, as well in France, as Italy. I was very genteelly &s;up|ported: I &s;tood in high credit with my countrymen, to whom I had many ways of being &s;erviceable. They made known to every-body my father's affec|tion for me; his magnificent &s;pirit; the antient fa|milies, on both &s;ides, from which I was de&s;cended. I kept the be&s;t company; avoided intrigues; made not my&s;elf obnoxious to &s;erious or pious people, tho' I &s;crupled not to avow, when called upon, my own principles. From all the&s;e advantages, I was re&s;pected beyond my degree.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not, madam, have been thus lavi&s;h in my own prai&s;e, but to account to you for the favour I
<PB N="171" REF="174">
&s;tood in with &s;everal families of the fir&s;t rank; and to &s;ugge&s;t an excu&s;e for more than one of them, which thought it no di&s;grace to wi&s;h me to be allied with them.</P>
<P>Lord L. mentioned to you, madam, and my &s;i&s;ters, a Florentine Lady, by the name of OLIVIA. She is, indeed, a woman of high qualities, nobly born, go|nerous, amiable in her features, genteel in her per&s;on, and mi&s;tre&s;s of a great fortune in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is entirely at her own di&s;po&s;al; having not father, mother, brother, or other near relations. The fir&s;t time I &s;aw her was at the opera. An opportunity offered in her &s;ight, where a Lady, in&s;ulted by a Lover made de&s;perate by her ju&s;t refu&s;al of him, claimed and received my protection. What I did, on the occa&s;ion, was generally applauded: Olivia, in particular, &s;poke highly of it. Twice, afterwards, I &s;aw her in company where I was a vi&s;iter: I had not the pre&s;umption to look up to her with hope; but my countryman Mr. Jervois gave me to under|&s;tand, that I might be ma&s;ter of my own fortune with Lady Olivia. I pleaded difference of religion: He believed, he &s;aid, that matter might be made ea&s;y&mdash;But could I be plea&s;ed with the change, would &s;he have made it, when pa&s;&s;ion, not conviction, was likely to be the motive?&mdash;There could be no objection to her per&s;on: Nobody que&s;tioned her virtue; but &s;he was violent and imperious in her temper. I had never left MIND out of my notions of love: I could not have been happy with her, had &s;he been queen of the globe. I had the mortification of being obliged to declare my&s;elf to the Lady's face: It <HI>was</HI> a mortifi|cation to me, as much for her &s;ake as my own. I was obliged to leave Florence upon it, for &s;ome time; having been apprized, that the &s;pirit of revenge had taken place of a gentler pa&s;&s;ion, and that I was in danger fromit.</P>
<P>How often did I lament the want of that refuge in a

father's arms, and in my native country, which &s;ub|jected me to evils that were more than a match for my tender years. and to all the inconveniencies that can attend a bani&s;hed man! Indeed I often con&s;idered my&s;elf in this light; and, as the inconveniencies hap|pened, was ready to repine; and the more ready, as I could not afflict my&s;elf with the thought of having forfeited my father's love; on the contrary, as the con&s;tant in&s;tances which I received of his paternal goodne&s;s, made me &s;till more earne&s;t to acknowlege it at his feet.</P>
<P>Ought I to have forborn, Lucy, &s;hewing a &s;en&s;ibi|lity at my eyes on this affecting in&s;tance of filial gra|titude? If I ought, I wi&s;h I had had more command of my&s;elf: But con&s;ider, my dear, the affecting &s;ub|ject we were upon. I was going to apologize for the trickling tear, and to have &s;aid, as I <HI>truly</HI> might, Your filial goodne&s;s, Sir, affects me: But, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that mu&s;t have accompanied the words, would not that, to &s;o nice a di&s;cerner, have been to own, that I thought the tender emotion wanted an apology? The&s;e little tricks of ours, Lucy, may &s;a|ti&s;fy our own punctilio, and &s;erve to keep us in coun|tenance with our&s;elves (and that, indeed, is doing &s;omething); but, to a penetrating eye, they tend only to &s;hew, that we imagined a cover, a veil, wanting; and what is that veil, but a veil of gauze?</P>
<P>What makes me &s;o much afraid of this man's di&s;|cernment? Am I not an hone&s;t girl, Lucy?</P>
<P>He proceeded.</P>
<P>From this violent Lady I had great trouble; and to this day&mdash;But this part of my &s;tory I leave to Dr. Bartlett to acquaint you with. I mention it as a mat|ter that yet gives me concern, for her &s;ake, and as what I find has given &s;ome amu&s;ement to my &s;i&s;ter Charlotte's curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> I ha&s;ten to the affair which, of all others, has mo&s;t embarra&s;&s;ed me; and which, engaging my com|pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="173" REF="176">
tho' my honour is free, gives torture to my very &s;oul.</P>
<P>I found my&s;elf not well&mdash;I thought I &s;hould have fainted&mdash;The apprehen&s;ion of his taking it as I wi&s;hed him not to take it (for indeed, Lucy, I don't think it was <HI>that)</HI> made me wor&s;e. Had I been <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> this fainti&s;hne&s;s might have come over my heart. I am &s;ure it was not <HI>that:</HI> But it &s;eized me at a very unlucky moment, you'll &s;ay.</P>
<P>With a countenance full of tender concern, he caught my hand, and rang. In ran his Emily. My dear Mi&s;s Jervois, &s;aid I, leaning upon her&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Sir&mdash;And I withdrew to the door: And, when there, finding my fainti&s;hne&s;s going off, I turned to him, who attended me thither: I am better, Sir, al|ready; I will return, in&s;tantly. I mu&s;t beg of you to proceed with your intere&s;ting &s;tory.</P>
<P>I was well the moment I was out of the Study. It was kept too warm, I believe; and I &s;at too near the fire: That was it, to be &s;ure; and I &s;aid &s;o, on my return; which was the moment I had drank a gla&s;s of cold water.</P>
<P>How tender was his regard for me! He did not aba&s;h me by <HI>cau&s;le&s;ly</HI> laying my di&s;order on his &s;tory, and by offering to di&s;continue or po&s;tpone it. Indeed, Lucy, it was not owing to <HI>that;</HI> I &s;hould ea&s;ily have di&s;tingui&s;hed it, if it had: On the contrary, as I am not generally &s;o much affected at the moment when any-thing unhappy befals me, as I am upon reflexion, when I extend, compare, and weigh con&s;equences, I was quite brave in my heart. Any-thing, thought I, is better than &s;u&s;pen&s;e. Now will my fortitude have a call to exert it&s;elf; and I warrant I bear, as well as he, an evil that is inevitable. At this in&s;tant, this trying in&s;tant, however, I found my&s;elf thus brave: So, my dear, it was nothing but the too great warmth of the room which overcame me.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume all my courage; and de&s;ired
<PB N="174" REF="177">
him to proceed; but held by the arm of my chair, to &s;teady me, le&s;t my little tremblings &s;hould increa&s;e. The faintne&s;s had left &s;ome little tremblings upon me, Lucy; and one would not care, you know, to be thought affected by any-thing in his &s;tory. He pro|ceeded.</P>
<P>AT Bologna, and in the neighbourhood of Urbino, are &s;eated two branches of a noble family, mar|qui&s;es and counts of Porretta, which boa&s;ts its pe|digree from Roman princes, and has given to the church two cardinals; one in the latter age, the other in the beginning of this.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e della Poretta, who re&s;ides in Bo|logna, is a nobleman of great merit: His Lady is il|lu&s;trious by de&s;cent, and &s;till more &s;o for her good|ne&s;s of heart, &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and prudence. They have three &s;ons, and a daughter&mdash;</P>
<P>[Ah, that daughter! thought I.]</P>
<P>The elde&s;t of the &s;ons is a general officers, in the &s;ervice of the king of the two Sicilies; a man of equal honour and bravery, but pa&s;&s;ionate and haughty, valuing him&s;elf on his de&s;cent. The &s;econd is de|voted to the church, and is already a Bi&s;hop. The intere&s;t of his family, and his own merits, it is not doubted, will one day if he lives, give him a place in the &s;acred college. The third, Signor Jeronymo (or, as he is &s;ometimes called, the Barone) della Porretta, has a regiment in the &s;ervice of the king of Sardinia. The &s;i&s;ter is the favourite of them all. She is lovely in her per&s;on, gentle in her manners, and has high, but ju&s;t, notions of the nobility of her de&s;cent, of the honour of her &s;ex, and of what is due to her own character. She is pious, charitable, beneficent. Her three brothers preferred her intere&s;ts to their own. Her father u&s;ed to call her, <HI>The pride of his life;</HI> her mother, <HI>Her other &s;elf; her own Clementina.</HI></P>
<P>[CLEMENTINA!&mdash;Ah! Lucy, what a pretty name is Clementina!]</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178">
I became intimate with Signor Jeronymo at Rome, near two years before I had the honour to be known to the re&s;t of his family, except by his report, which he made run very high in my favour. He was ma&s;ter of many fine qualities; but had contracted friend&s;hip with a &s;et of di&s;&s;olute young men of rank, with whom he was very earne&s;t to make me acquainted. I allowed my&s;elf to be often in their company; but, as they were totally abandoned in their morals, it was in hopes, by degrees, to draw him from them: But a love of plea&s;ure had got fa&s;t hold of him; and his other companions prevailed over his good-nature. He had courage, but not enough to re&s;i&s;t their libertine at|tacks upon his morals.</P>
<P>Such a friend&s;hip could not hold, while each &s;tood his ground; and neither would advance to meet the other. In &s;hort, we parted, nor held a corre&s;pond|ence in ab&s;ence: But afterwards meeting, by acci|dent, at Padua, and Jeronymo having, in the interim, been led into inconveniencies, he avowed a change of principles, and the friend&s;hip was renewed.</P>
<P>It however held not many months: A Lady, le&s;s celebrated for virtue than beauty, obtained an influ|ence over him, again&s;t warning, again&s;t promi&s;e.</P>
<P>On being expo&s;tulated with, and his promi&s;e claimed, he re&s;ented the friendly freedom. He was pa&s;&s;ionate; and, on this occa&s;ion, le&s;s polite than it was natural for him to be: He even defied his friend. My dear Jeronymo how generou&s;ly has he acknow|leged &s;ince, the part his friend, at that time, acted! But the re&s;ult was, they parted, re&s;olving never more to &s;ee each other.</P>
<P>Jeronymo pur&s;ued the adventure which had occa|&s;ioned the difference; and one of the Lady's admi|rers, envying him his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s, hired Bre&s;cian bravoes to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him.</P>
<P>The attempt was made in the Cremone&s;e. They had got him into their toils in a little thicket at &s;ome
<PB N="176" REF="179">
di&s;tance from the road. I, attended by two &s;ervants, happened to be pa&s;&s;ing, when a frighted hor&s;e ran acro&s;s the way, his bridle broken, and his &s;addle bloody: This making me apprehend &s;ome mi&s;chief to the ri|der, I drove down the opening he came from, and &s;oon beheld a man &s;truggling on the ground with two ruf|f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ans; one of whom was ju&s;t &s;topping his mouth, the other &s;tabbing him. I leapt out of the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and drew my &s;word, running towards them as fa&s;t as I could; and, calling to my &s;ervants to follow me, indeed calling as if I had a number with me, in order to alarm them. On this, they fled; and I heard them &s;ay, Let us make off; we have done his bu&s;ine&s;s. Incen&s;ed at the villainy, I pur&s;ued and came up with one of them, who turned upon me. I beat down his <HI>trombone,</HI> a kind of blunderbu&s;s, ju&s;t as he pre&s;ented it at me, and had wounded and thrown him on the ground; but &s;eeing the other ru&s;&s;ian turning back to help his fellow, and, on a &s;udden, two others appear|ing with their hor&s;es, I thought it be&s;t to retreat, tho' I would &s;ain have &s;ecured one of them. My &s;ervants then &s;eeing my danger, ha&s;tened, &s;houting, towards me. The bravoes (perhaps apprehending there were more than two) &s;eemed as glad to get off with their re&s;cued companion, as I was to retire. I ha&s;tened then to the unhappy man: But how much was I &s;urpri&s;ed, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> I found him to be the Barone della Porretta, who, in di&s;gui&s;e, had been actually pur&s;uing his amour!</P>
<P>He gave &s;igns of life. I in&s;tantly di&s;patched one of my &s;ervants to Cremona, for a &s;urgeon: I bound up, mean time, as well as I could, two of his wounds, one in his &s;houlder, the other in his brea&s;t. He had one in his hip-joint, that di&s;abled him from helping him&s;elf, and which I found beyond my &s;kill to do any|thing with; only endeavouring, with my handker|chief, to &s;top its bleeding. I helped him into my chai&s;e, &s;tept in with him, and held him up in it, till one of my men told me, they had, in another part of
<PB N="177" REF="180">
the thicket, found his &s;ervant bound and wounded his hor&s;e lying dead by his &s;ide. I then alighted, and put the poor fellow into the chai&s;e, he being &s;tiff with his hurts, and unable to &s;tand.</P>
<P>I walked by the &s;ide of it, and in this manner moved towards Cremona, in order to &s;horten the way of the expected &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>My &s;ervant &s;oon returned with one. Jeronymo had &s;ainted away. The &s;urgeon dre&s;&s;ed him, and pro|ceeded with him to Cremona. Then it was, that, opening his eyes, he beheld, and knew me; and being told, by the &s;ugeon, that he owed his pre&s;ervation to me, O Grandi&s;on! &s;aid he, that I had followed your advice! that I had kept my promi&s;e with you!&mdash;How did I in&s;ult you!&mdash;Can my deliverer forgive me? You &s;hall be the director of my future life, if it plea&s;e God to re&s;tore me.</P>
<P>His wounds proved not mortal; but he never will be the man he was: Partly from his having been un|&s;kilfully treated by this his fir&s;t &s;urgeon; and partly from his own impatience, and the difficulty of curing the wound in his hip-joint. Excu&s;e this particularity, madam. The &s;ubject requires it; and Signor Jero|nymo now de&s;erves it, and all your pity.</P>
<P>I attended him at Cremona, till he was fit to re|move. He was vi&s;ited there by his whole family from Bologna. There never was a family more affectionate to one another: The &s;uffering of one, is the &s;uffering of every one. The Barone was exceedingly beloved by his father, mother, &s;i&s;ter, for the &s;weetne&s;s of his manners, his affectionate heart, and a wit &s;o delight|fully gay and lively, that his company was &s;ought by every-body.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily believe, madam, from what I have &s;aid, how acceptable to the whole family the &s;ervice was which I had been &s;o happy as to render their Jeronymo. They all joined to ble&s;s me; and the more, when they came to know that I was the per&s;on
<PB N="178" REF="181">
whom their Jeronymo, in the days of our intimacy, had highly extolled in his Letters to his &s;i&s;ter, and to both brothers; and who now related to them, by word of mouth, the occa&s;ion of the coldne&s;s that had pa&s;&s;ed between us, with circum&s;tances as honourable for me, as the contrary for him&s;elf: Such were his penitential confe&s;&s;ions, in the de&s;perate condition to which he found him&s;elf reduced.</P>
<P>He now, as I attended by his bed or his couch|&s;ide, frequently called for a repetition of tho&s;e argu|ments which he had, till <HI>now,</HI> derided. He be&s;ought me to forgive him for treating them before with le|vity, and me with di&s;re&s;pect, next, as he &s;aid, to in|&s;ult: And he begged his family to con&s;ider me not only as the pre&s;erver of his life, but as the re&s;torer of his <HI>morals.</HI> This gave the whole family the highe&s;t opinion of <HI>mine;</HI> and &s;till more to &s;trengthen it, the generous youth produced to them, tho', as I may &s;ay, at his own expence (for his reformation was &s;incere), a Letter which I wrote to lie by him, in hopes to en|force his temporary convictions; for he had a noble nature, and a lively &s;en&s;e of what was due to his cha|racter, and to the love and piety of his parents, the Bi&s;hop, and his &s;i&s;ter; tho' he was loth to think he could be wrong in tho&s;e pur&s;uits in which he was wil|ling to indulge him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Never was there a more grateful family. The no|ble <HI>father</HI> was unea&s;y, becau&s;e he know not how to ac|knowlege, according to the largene&s;s of his heart to a man in genteel circum&s;tances, the obligation laid upon them all. The <HI>mother,</HI> with a freedom more amiably great than the Italian Ladies are accu&s;tomed to expre&s;s, bid her Clementina regard as her fourth brother, the pre&s;erver of the third. The <HI>Barone</HI> de|clared, that he &s;hould never re&s;t, nor <HI>recover,</HI> till he had got me rewarded in &s;uch manner as all the world &s;hould think I had honour done me in it.</P>
<P>When the Barone was removed to Bologna, the
<PB N="179" REF="182">
whole family were &s;tudious to make occa&s;ions to get me among them. The General made me promi&s;e, when <HI>my relations,</HI> as he was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s him|&s;elf, at Bologna, could part with me, to give him my company at Naples. The Bi&s;hop, who pa&s;&s;ed all the time he had to &s;pare from his dioce&s;e, at Bologna, and who is a learned man, in compliment to his <HI>fourth</HI> brother, would have me initiate him into the knowlege of the Engli&s;h tongue.</P>
<P>Our Milton has de&s;ervedly a name among them. The friend&s;hip that there was between him and a learned nobleman of their country, endeared his me|mory to them. Milton, therefore, was a principal author with us. Our lectures were u&s;ually held in the chamber of the wounded brother, in order to di|vert him: <HI>He</HI> al&s;o became my &s;cholar. The father and mother were often pre&s;ent; and at &s;uch times their Clementina was &s;eldom ab&s;ent. <HI>She</HI> al&s;o called me her tutor; and, tho' &s;he was not half &s;o often pre|&s;ent at the lectures as they were, made a greater pro|ficiency than either of her brothers.</P>
<P>[Do you doubt it, Lucy?]</P>
<P>The father, as well as the Bi&s;hop, is learned; the mother well read. She had had the benefit of a French education; being brought up by her uncle, who re&s;id|ed many years at Paris in a public character: And her daughter had, under her own eye, advantages in her education which are hardly ever allowed or &s;ought after by the Italian Ladies. In &s;uch company, you may believe, madam, that I, who was kept abroad again&s;t my wi&s;hes, pa&s;&s;ed my time very agreeably. I was particularly honoured with the confidence of the Marchione&s;s, who opened her heart to me, and con|&s;ulted me on every material occurrence. Her Lord, who is one of the polite&s;t of men, was never better plea&s;ed than when he found us together; and not &s;el|dom, tho' we were not engaged in lectures, the fair
<PB N="180" REF="183">
Clementina claimed a right to be where her mother was.</P>
<P>About this time, the young Count of Belvedere returned to Parma, in order to &s;ettle in his native country. His father was a favourite in the court of the prince&s;s of Parma, and attended that Lady to Madrid, on her marriage with the late king of Spain, where he held a very con&s;iderable po&s;t, and lately died there immen&s;ely rich. On a vi&s;it to this noble fami|ly, the young Lord &s;aw, and loved Clementina.</P>
<P>The Count of Belvedere is a hand&s;ome, a gallant, a &s;en&s;ible man; his fortune is very great: Such an al|liance was not to be &s;lighted. The Marquis gave his countenance to it: The Marchione&s;s favoured me with &s;everal conver&s;ations upon the &s;ubject. She was of opinion, perhaps, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to know my thoughts, on this occa&s;ion; for the younger bro|ther, unknown to me, declared, that he thought there was no way of rewarding my merits to the fa|mily, but by giving me a relation to it. Dr. Bartlett, madam, can &s;hew you, from my Letters to him, &s;ome conver&s;ations, which will convince you, that in Italy, as well as in other countries, there are per&s;ons of honour, of goodne&s;s, of genero&s;ity; and who are above re&s;erve, vindictivene&s;s, jealou&s;y, and tho&s;e other bad pa&s;&s;ions by which &s;ome per&s;ons mark in|di&s;criminately a whole nation.</P>
<P>For my own part, it was impo&s;&s;ible (di&s;tingui&s;hed as I was by every individual of this noble family, and lovely as is this daughter of it, mi&s;tre&s;s of a thou&s;and good qualities, and my&s;elf ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged in my affections) that my vanity &s;hould not &s;ometimes be awakened, and a wi&s;h ari&s;e, that there might be a po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining &s;uch a prize: But I checked the vanity, the moment I could find it begin to play about and warm my heart. To have attempted to recommend my&s;elf to the young Lady's favour, tho'
<PB N="181" REF="184">
but by looks, by a&s;&s;iduities, I &s;hould have thought an infamous breach of the tru&s;t and confidence they all repo&s;ed in me.</P>
<P>The pride of a family &s;o illu&s;trious in its de&s;cent; their fortunes unu&s;ually high for the country which, by the goodne&s;s of their hearts, they adorned; the relation they bore to the church; my foreign extra|ction and intere&s;t; the Lady's exalted merits, which made her of con&s;equence to the hearts of &s;everal illu|&s;trious youths, before the Count of Belvedere made known his pa&s;&s;ion for her; none of which the fond family thought worthy of their Clementina, nor any of whom could engage her heart; but, above all, the difference in religion; the young Lady &s;o remarkably &s;tedfa&s;t in hers, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty they could re&s;train her from a&s;&s;uming the veil; and who once declared, in anger, on hearing me, when called upon, avow my principles, that &s;he grudged to an heretic the glory of having &s;aved the Barone della Poretta; all the&s;e con&s;iderations outweighed any hopes that might otherwi&s;e have ari&s;en in a bo&s;om &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the favours they were continually heaping upon me.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, the troubles, now &s;o happily appea&s;ed, broke out in Scotland: Hardly any thing el&s;e was talked of, in Italy, but the progre&s;s, and &s;up|po&s;ed certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, of the young invader. I was often obliged to &s;tand the triumphs and exulta|tions of per&s;ons of rank and figure; being known to be warm in the intere&s;t of my country. I had a good deal of this kind of &s;pirit to contend with, even in this more moderate Italian family; and this fre|quently brought on debates which I would gladly have avoided holding: But it was impo&s;&s;ible. Every new advice from England revived the di&s;agreeable &s;ubject; for the &s;ucce&s;s of the rebels, it was not doubted, would be attended with the re&s;toration of what they called the Catholic religion: And Clementina particularly
<PB N="182" REF="185">
plea&s;ed her&s;elf, that then her <HI>heretic tutor</HI> would take refuge in the bo&s;om of his holy mother, the church: And &s;he delighted to &s;ay things of this nature in the language I was teaching her, and which, by this time, &s;he &s;poke very intelligibly.</P>
<P>I took a re&s;olution, hereupon, to leave Italy for a while, and to retire to Vienna, or to &s;ome one of the German courts that was le&s;s intere&s;ted than they were in Italy, in the &s;ucce&s;s of the Chevalier's undertaking; and I was the more de&s;irous to do &s;o, as the di&s;plea&s;ure of Olivia again&s;t me began to grow &s;erious, and to be talked of, even by her&s;elf, with le&s;s di&s;cretion than was con&s;i&s;tent with her high &s;pirit, her noble birth, and ample fortune.</P>
<P>I communicated my intention to the Marchione&s;s fir&s;t: The noble Lady expre&s;&s;ed her concern at the thoughts of my quitting Italy, and engaged me to put off my departure for &s;ome weeks; but, at the &s;ame time, hinted to me, with an explicitne&s;s that is pecu|liar to her, her apprehen&s;ions, and her Lord's, that I was in Love with her Clementina. I convinced her of my honour, in this particular; and &s;he &s;o well &s;a|tisfied the Marquis, in this re&s;pect, that, on their daughter's ab&s;olute refu&s;al of the Count of Belvedere, they confided in me to talk to her in favour of that gentleman. The young Lady and I had a conference upon the &s;ubject; Dr. Bartlett can give you the par|ticulars. The father and mother, unknown to us both, had placed them&s;elves in a clo&s;et adjoining to the room we were in, and which communicated to an|other, as well as to that: They had no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with what they heard me &s;ay to their daughter.</P>
<P>The time of my departure from Italy drawing near, and the young Lady repeatedly refu&s;ing the Count of Belvidere, the younger brother (&s;till unknown to me, for he doubted not but I &s;hould rejoice at the honour he hoped to prevail upon them to do me) declared in
<PB N="183" REF="186">
my favour. They objected the more obvious diffi|culties in relation to religion, and my country: He de&s;ired to be commi&s;&s;ioned to talk to me on tho&s;e &s;ub|jects, and to his &s;i&s;ter on her motives for refu&s;ing the Count of Belvedere; but they would not hear of his &s;peaking to me on this &s;ubject; the Marchione&s;s giv|ing generous rea&s;ons, on my behalf, for her joining in the refu&s;al; and undertaking her&s;elf to talk to her daughter, and to demand of her, her rea&s;ons for re|jecting every propo&s;al that had been made her.</P>
<P>She accordingly clo&s;etted her Clementina. She could get nothing from her, but tears: A &s;ilence, without the lea&s;t appearance of &s;ullenne&s;s, had for &s;ome days before &s;hewn, that a deep melancholy had begun to lay hold of her heart: She was, however, offended when Love was attributed to her; yet her mother told me, that &s;he could not but &s;u&s;pect, that &s;he was under the dominion of that pa&s;&s;ion without knowing it; and the rather, as &s;he was never chearful but when &s;he was taking le&s;&s;ons for learning a tongue, that never, as the Marchione&s;s &s;aid, was likely to be of u&s;e to her.</P>
<P>['As the <HI>Marchione&s;s</HI> &s;aid'&mdash;Ah my Lucy!]</P>
<P>The melancholy increa&s;ed. Her tutor, as he was called, was de&s;ired to talk to her. He did. It was a ta&s;k put upon him, that had its difficulties. It was ob&s;erved, that &s;he generally a&s;&s;umed a chearful air while &s;he was with <HI>him,</HI> but &s;aid little: yet &s;eemed plea&s;ed with every-thing he &s;aid to her; and the lit|tle &s;he did an&s;wer, tho' he &s;poke in Italian or French, was in her newly-acquired language: But the mo|ment he was gone, her countenance fell, and &s;he was &s;tudious to find opportunities to get from com|pany.</P>
<P>[What think you of my &s;ortitude, Lucy? Was I not a good girl? But my curio&s;ity kept up my &s;pirits. When I come to reflect, thought I, I &s;hall have it all upon my pillow.]</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="187">
Her parents were in the deepe&s;t affliction. They con&s;ulted phy&s;icians, who all pronounced her malady to be Love. She was taxed with it; and all the in|dulgence promi&s;ed her that her heart could wi&s;h, as to the object; but &s;till &s;he could not, with patience, bear the imputation. Once &s;he a&s;ked her woman, who told her that &s;he was certainly in Love, Would you have me hate my&s;elf?&mdash;Her mother talked to her of the pa&s;&s;ion in favourable terms, and as laudable: She heard her with attention, but made no an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The evening before the day I was to &s;et out for Germany, the family made a &s;umptuous entertain|ment, in honour of a gue&s;t on whom they had con|ferred &s;o many favours. They had brought them|&s;elves to approve of his departure the more readily, as they were willing to &s;ee, whether his ab&s;ence would affect their Clementina; and, if it did, in what manner.</P>
<P>They left it to her choice. Whether &s;he would ap|pear at table, or not. She cho&s;e to be there. They all rejoiced at her recovered &s;pirits. She was ex|ceeding chearful: She &s;upported her part of the con|ver&s;ation, during the whole evening, with her u&s;ual vivacity and good &s;en&s;e, in&s;omuch that I wi&s;hed to my&s;elf, I had departed &s;ooner. Yet it is &s;urpri&s;ing, thought I that this young Lady, who &s;eemed always to be plea&s;ed, and even &s;ince the&s;e re&s;veries have had power over her, to be mo&s;t chearful in my company, &s;hould rejoice in my departure; &s;hould &s;eem to owe her recovery to it; a departure which every one el&s;e kindly regrets: And yet there was nothing in her be|haviour or looks that appeared in the lea&s;t affected. When acknowlegements were made to me of the plea&s;ure I had given to the whole family, &s;he joined in them: When my health and happine&s;s were wi&s;hed, &s;he added <HI>her</HI> wi&s;hes by chearful bows, as &s;he &s;at: When they wi&s;hed to &s;ee me again, before I went to England, &s;he did the &s;ame. So that my heart was

dilated: I was overjoyed to &s;ee &s;uch an happy altera|tion. When I took leave of them, &s;he &s;tood for|ward to receive my compliments, with a polite French freedom. I offered to pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> her hand with my lips: My brother's deliverer, &s;aid &s;he, mu&s;t not affect this di&s;tance, and, in manner, offered her cheek; add|ing, God pre&s;erve my tutor where-ever he &s;et his foot (and in Engli&s;h, God convert you too, Chevalier!) May you never want &s;uch an agreeable friend as you have been to us!</P>
<P>Signor Jeronymo was not able to be with us. I went up to take leave of him: O my Grandi&s;on! &s;aid he, and flung his arms about my neck, and will you go?&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ings attend you!&mdash;But what will be|come of a brother and &s;i&s;ter, when they have lo&s;t you?</P>
<P>You will rejoice me, replied I, if you will favour me with a few lines, by a &s;ervant whom I &s;hall leave behind me for a few days, and who will find me at In&s;pruck, to let me know how you all do; and whe|ther your &s;i&s;ter's health continues.</P>
<P>She mu&s;t, &s;he &s;hall be yours, &s;aid he, if I can manage it. Why, why, will you leave us?</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed to hear him &s;ay this: He had never before been &s;o particular.</P>
<P>That cannot, cannot be, &s;aid I. There are a thou&s;and ob&s;tacles&mdash;</P>
<P>All of which, rejoined he, that depend upon us, I doubt not to overcome. Your heart is not with Olivia?</P>
<P>They all knew, from that Lady's indi&s;cretion, of the propo&s;als that had been made me, relating to her; and of my declining them. I a&s;&s;ured him, that my heart was free.</P>
<P>We agreed upon a corre&s;pondence, and I took leave of one of the mo&s;t grateful of men.</P>
<P>But how much was I afflicted when I received at In&s;pruck the expected Letter, which acquainted me, that this &s;un&s;hine la&s;ted no longer than the next day!
<PB N="186" REF="189">
The young Lady's malady returned, with redoubled force. Shall I, madam, briefly relate to you the manner in which, as her brother wrote, it operated upon her?</P>
<P>She &s;hut her&s;elf up in her chamber, not &s;eeming to regard or know that her woman was in it; nor did &s;he an&s;wer to two or three que&s;tions that her woman a&s;ked her; but, &s;etting her chair with its back to|wards her, over-again&s;t a clo&s;et in the room, after a profound &s;ilence, &s;he bent forwards, and, in a low voice, &s;eemed to be communing with a per&s;on in the clo&s;et.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'And you &s;ay he is actually gone? Gone for ever? No, not for ever!'</Q></P>
<P>Who gone, madam? &s;aid her woman. To whom do you direct your di&s;cour&s;e?</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'We were all obliged to him, no doubt. So bravely to re&s;cue my brother, and to pur&s;ue the bravoes; and, as my brother &s;ays, to put him in his own chai&s;e, and walk on foot by the &s;ide of it&mdash;Why, as you &s;ay, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins might have murdered him: The hor&s;es might have trampled him under their feet.'</Q> Still looking as if &s;he was &s;peaking to &s;omebody in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>Her woman &s;tept to the clo&s;et, and opened the door, and left it open, to take off her attention to the place, and to turn the cour&s;e of her ideas; but &s;till &s;he bent forwards towards, and talked calmly, as if to &s;omebody in it: Then breaking into a faint laugh, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'In Love!&mdash;that is &s;uch a &s;illy notion: And yet I love every-body better than I love my&s;elf.'</Q></P>
<P>Her mother came into the room ju&s;t then. The young Lady aro&s;e in ha&s;te, and &s;hut the clo&s;et-door, as if &s;he had &s;omebody hid there, and, throwing her&s;elf at her mother's feet, My dear, my ever-ho|noured mama, &s;aid &s;he, forgive me for all the trou|ble I have cau&s;ed you&mdash;But I will, I mu&s;t, you can't deny me; I will be God's child, as well as yours.

<P><PB N="187" REF="190">
It came out afterwards, that her confe&s;&s;or, taking advantage of confe&s;&s;ions extorted from her of regard for her tutor, tho' only &s;uch as a &s;i&s;ter might bear to a brother, but which he had &s;u&s;pected might come to be of con&s;equence, had filled her tender mind with terrors, that had thus affected her head. She is, as I have told you, madam, a young Lady of exemplary piety.</P>
<P>I will not dwell on a &s;cene &s;o melancholy. How I afflict your tender heart, my good Mi&s;s Byron!</P>
<P>[Do you think, Lucy, I did not weep?&mdash;Indeed I did&mdash;Poor young Lady!&mdash;But my mind was fitted for the indulging of &s;cenes &s;o melancholy. Pray, Sir, proceed, &s;aid I: What a heart mu&s;t that be, which bleeds not for &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;s! Pray, Sir, proceed.]</P>
<P>Be it Dr. Bartlett's task to give you further parti|culars. I will be briefer&mdash;I will not indulge my own grief.</P>
<P>All that medicine could do, was tried: But her confe&s;&s;or, who, however, is an hone&s;t, a worthy man, kept up her fears and terrors. He &s;aw the favour her tutor was in with the whole family: He knew that the younger brother had declared for rewarding him in a very high manner: He had more than once put this favoured man upon an avowal of his prin|ciples; and, betwixt her piety and her gratitude, had rai&s;ed &s;uch a conflict as her tender nature could not bear.</P>
<P>At Florence lives a family of high rank and honour, the Ladies of which have with them a friend noted for the excellency of her heart, and her genius; and who, having been robbed of her fortune early in life, by an uncle to who&s;e care &s;he was committed by her dying father, was received both as a companion and a ble&s;&s;ing, by the Ladies of the family &s;he has now for many years lived with. She is an Engli&s;h woman, and a Prote&s;tant; but &s;o very di&s;creet, that her being &s;o, tho' at fir&s;t they hoped to pro&s;elyte her, gives
<PB N="188" REF="191">
them not a le&s;s value for her; and yet they are all zealous Roman Catholics. The&s;e two Ladies, and this their companion, were vi&s;iting one day at the Marche&s;e della Porretta's; and there the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother told them the mournful tale: The Ladies, who think nothing that is within the compa&s;s of hu|man prudence impo&s;&s;ible to their dear Mrs. BEAU|MONT, wi&s;hed that the young Lady might be en|tru&s;ted for a week to her care, at their own hou&s;e at Florence.</P>
<P>It was con&s;ented to, as &s;oon as propo&s;ed; and Lady Clementina was as willing to go; there having always been an intimacy between the families; and &s;he (as every-body el&s;e) having an high opinion of Mrs. Beaumont. They took her with them on the day they &s;et out for Florence.</P>
<P>Here, again, for &s;hortening my &s;tory, I will refer to Dr. Bartlett. Mrs. Beaumont went to the bottom of the malady: She gave her advice to the family upon it. They were re&s;olved (Signor Jeronymo &s;upporting her advice) to be governed by it. The young Lady was told, that &s;he &s;hould be indulged in all her wi&s;hes. She then acknowleged what tho&s;e were; and was the ea|&s;ier for the acknowlegement, and for the advice of &s;uch a prudent friend; and returned to Bologna (Mrs. Beau|mont accompanying her) much more compo&s;ed than when &s;he left it. The tutor was &s;ent for, by com|mon con&s;ent; for there had been a convention of the whole family; the Urbino branch, as well as the Ge|neral, being pre&s;ent. There the terms to be propo&s;ed to the &s;uppo&s;ed happy man were &s;ettled; but they were not to be mentioned to him, till after he had &s;een the Lady: A wrong policy, &s;urely.</P>
<P>He was then at Vienna. Signor Jeronymo, in his Letter, congratulated him in high terms; as a man, whom he had it now, at la&s;t, in his power to reward: And he hinted, in general, that the conditions would be &s;uch, as it was impo&s;&s;ible but he mu&s;t find his very
<PB N="189" REF="192">
great advantage in them: As to fortune, to be &s;ure, he meant.</P>
<P>The friend &s;o highly valued could not but be af|fected with the news: Yet, knowing the Lady, and the family, he was afraid that the articles of Re&s;idence and Religion would not be ea&s;ily compromi&s;ed between them. He therefore &s;ummoned up all his prudence to keep his fears alive, and his hope in &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>He arrived at Bologna. He was permitted to pay his compliments to Lady Clementina in her mother's pre&s;ence. How agreeable, how nobly frank, was the reception from both mother and daughter! How high ran the congratulations of Jeronymo! He called the &s;uppo&s;ed happy man <HI>brother.</HI> The Marquis was ready to recognize the <HI>fourth</HI> &s;on in him. A great fortune, additional to an e&s;tate bequeathed her by her two|grandfathers, was propo&s;ed. My father was to be in|vited over, to grace the nuptials by his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>But let me cut &s;hort the re&s;t. The terms could not be complied with: For I was to make a formal renuncia|tion of my religion, and to &s;ettle in Italy; only once, in two or three years, was allowed, if I plea&s;ed, for two or three months, to go to England; and, as a vi&s;it of curio&s;ity, once in her life, if their daughter de&s;ired it, to carry her thither, for a time to be limited by them.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t be my grief, to be obliged to di&s;appoint &s;uch expectations as were rai&s;ed by per&s;ons who had &s;o &s;incere a value for me! You cannot, madam, imagine my di&s;tre&s;s: So little as could be expected to be allowed by them to the principles of a man whom they &s;uppo&s;ed to be in an error that would inevitably ca&s;t him into perdition! But when the friendly bro|the implored my compliance; when the excellent mother, in effect, be&s;ought me to have pity on <HI>her</HI> heart, and on her <HI>child</HI>'s head; and when the tender, the amiable Clementina, putting <HI>her&s;elf</HI> out of the que&s;tion, urged me, for my &s;oul's &s;ake, to embrace the doctrines of her holy mother the church&mdash;What, madam&mdash;But how I grieve you!</P>

I propo&s;ed to leave her entirely at her liberty, in the article of religion; and, in ca&s;e of children by the mar|riage, the daughters to be educated by <HI>her,</HI> the &s;ons by <HI>me;</HI> a condition to which his Holine&s;s him&s;elf, it was pre&s;umed, would not refu&s;e his &s;anction, as there were precedents for it. This, madam, was a great &s;acrifice to Compa&s;&s;ion, to Love.&mdash;What <HI>could</HI> I more!</P>
<P>And would not, Sir, would not Clementina con|&s;ent to this compromi&s;e?</P>
<P>Ah the unhappy Lady! It is this reflexion that &s;trengthens my grief. She <HI>would</HI> have con&s;ented: She was earne&s;t to procure the con&s;ent of her friends upon the&s;e terms.

The noble father forgot his promi&s;ed indulgence; the mother indeed &s;eemed, in a manner, neutral; the younge&s;t brother was &s;till, however, firm in my cau&s;e; but the Marquis, the General, the Bi&s;hop, and the whole Urbino branch of the family, were not to be moved; and the le&s;s, as they con&s;idered the alliance as highly honourable to me (a private, an ob|&s;cure man, as now they began to call me) <HI>as</HI> dero|gatory to their own honour.

<P>I told you, madam, that my Compa&s;&s;ion was en|gaged; but that any Honour was free: I <HI>think</HI> it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> But when you have &s;een all that Dr. Bartlett will &s;hew you, you will be the better able to judge <HI>of</HI> me, and <HI>for</HI> me.

<P>Who, Sir, &s;aid I, knowing only &s;o far as I know of the unhappy Clementina, but mu&s;t wi&s;h her to be&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah Lucy! there I &s;topt&mdash;I had like to have been a fal&s;e girl!&mdash;And yet ought I not, from my heart, to have been able to &s;ay what I was going to &s;ay?&mdash;I do aver, Lucy, upon repeated experience, that Love is a narrower of the heart.

<P>And now, madam, &s;aid he [and he was going to take my hand, but with an air, as if he thought the freedmo would be too great&mdash;A tenderne&s;s <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;peaking in his eyes; a re&s;pectfulne&s;s <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;olemn in his coun|tenance; he ju&s;t touched it, and withdrew his hand] What &s;hall I &s;ay?&mdash;I cannot tell what I &s;hould &s;ay&mdash;But you, I &s;ee, can pity me!&mdash;You can pity the noble Clementina&mdash;Honour forbids me!&mdash;Yet honour bids me&mdash;Yet I cannot be unju&s;t, ungenerous&mdash;&s;elfi&s;h!&mdash;</P>
<P>He aro&s;e from his &s;eat&mdash;Allow me, madam, to thank you for the favour of your ear&mdash;Pardon me for
<PB N="193" REF="196">
the trouble I &s;ee I have given to an heart that is ca|pable of a &s;ympathy &s;o tender&mdash;</P>
<P>And, bowing low, he withdrew with precipitation, as if he would not let me &s;ee his emotion. He left me looking here, looking there, as if for my heart; and then, as giving it up for irrecoverable, I became for a few moments motionle&s;s, and a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>A violent bur&s;t of tears recovered me to &s;en&s;e and motion; and ju&s;t then Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on (who having heard her brother withdraw, forbore for a few mi|nutes to enter, &s;uppo&s;ing he would return, hearing me &s;ob, ru&s;hed in.&mdash;O my Harriet! &s;aid &s;he, cla&s;ping her arms about me, What is done!&mdash;Do I, or do I not, embrace my &s;i&s;ter, my <HI>real</HI> &s;i&s;ter, my &s;i&s;ter Gran|di&s;on?</P>
<P>Ah my Charlotte! No &s;lattering hope is now left me&mdash;No &s;i&s;ter! It mu&s;t not, it cannot be! The Lady is&mdash;But lead me, lead me out of this room!&mdash;I don't love it! &s;preading one hand before my eyes, my tears trickling between my fingers&mdash;Tears that flowed not only for my&s;elf, but for Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on and the unhappy Clementina: For, gather you not from what he &s;aid, that &s;omething di&s;a&s;trous has befallen the poor Lady? And then, &s;upporting my&s;elf with her arm, I hurried out of Lord L.'s Study, and up &s;tairs into my own chamber; &s;he following me&mdash;Leave me, leave me here, dear creature, &s;aid I, for &s;ix minutes: I will attend you then, in your own dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>She kindly retired; I threw my&s;elf into a chair, indulged my tears for a few moments, and was the fitter to receive the two &s;i&s;ters, who, hand-in-hand, came into my room to comfort me.</P>
<P>But I could not relate what had pa&s;&s;ed immediately with any connexion: I told them only, that all was over; that their brother was to be pitied, not blamed: And that if they would allow me to recollect &s;ome things that were mo&s;t affecting, I would attend them;
<PB N="194" REF="197">
and they &s;hould have my narrative the more exact, for the indulgence.</P>
<P>They &s;tayed no longer with me than to &s;ee me a little compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Sir Charles and Dr. Bartlett went out together in his chariot: He enquired more than once of my health; &s;aying to his &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, That he was afraid he had affected me too much, by the melan|choly tale he had been telling me.</P>
<P>He excu&s;ed him&s;elf from dining with us. Poor man! What mu&s;t be his di&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;Not able to &s;ee, to &s;it with us!</P>
<P>I would have excu&s;ed my&s;elf al&s;o, being not very fit to appear; but was not permitted.</P>
<P>I &s;at, however, but a very little while at table after dinner; and how tedious did the dinner-time appear! The &s;ervants eyes were irk&s;ome to me; &s;o were Emily's (dear girl!) gli&s;tening as they did, tho' &s;he knew not for what, but &s;ympathetically, as I may &s;ay; &s;he &s;uppo&s;ing, that all was not as &s;he would have it.</P>
<P>She came up &s;oon after to me&mdash;One word, my deare&s;t madam (the door in her hand, and her head only within it): Tell me only that there is no mi&s;un|der&s;tanding between my guardian and you!&mdash;Tell me only that&mdash;</P>
<P>None, my dear!&mdash;None, none at all, my Emily!</P>
<P>Thank God! cla&s;ping her hands together; thank God!&mdash;If there were, I &s;hould not have known who&s;e part to take!&mdash;But I won't di&s;turb you&mdash;And was going.</P>
<P>Stay, &s;tay, my precious young friend! Stay, my Emily.&mdash;I aro&s;e; took her hand: My &s;weet girl! &s;ay, Will you live with me?</P>
<P>God for ever ble&s;s you, deare&s;t madam!&mdash;<HI>Will</HI> I? It is the wi&s;h next my heart.</P>
<P>Will you go down with me to Northampton&s;hire, my love?</P>
<P>To the world's end I will attend you, madam: I
<PB N="195" REF="198">
will be your handmaid; and I will love you better than I love my guardian, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Ah my dear! but how will you live without &s;eeing your guardian now-and-then?</P>
<P>Why he will live with us, won't he?</P>
<P>No, no, my dear!&mdash;And you would choo&s;e, then, to live with him, not with me, would you not?&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed but I won't&mdash;Indeed I will live and die with you, if you will let me; and I warrant his kind heart will often lead him to us. But tell me, Why the&s;e tears, madam? Why this grief?&mdash;Why do you &s;peak &s;o quick and &s;hort? and why do you &s;eem to be in &s;uch a hurry?</P>
<P><HI>Do</HI> I &s;peak quick and &s;hort? <HI>Do</HI> I &s;eem to be in a hurry?&mdash;Thank you, my love, for your ob&s;ervation. And now leave me: I will profit by it.</P>
<P>The amiable girl withdrew on tiptoe; and I &s;at about compo&s;ing my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I was obliged to her for her ob&s;ervation: It was really of u&s;e to me. But you mu&s;t think, Lucy, that I mu&s;t be fluttered&mdash;His manner of <HI>leaving</HI> me&mdash;Was it not particular?&mdash;To break from me &s;o <HI>ab|ruptly,</HI> as I may &s;ay&mdash;And what he &s;aid with looks &s;o earne&s;t!

I can't &s;ay but I think my &s;u&s;|pen&s;e is over; and in a way not very de&s;ireable&mdash;Yet&mdash;But why &s;hould I puzzle my&s;elf? What mu&s;t be, mu&s;t.</P>
<P>At afternoon-tea, the gentlemen not being returned, and Emily undertaking the walter's office, I gave my Lord and the two Ladies, tho' &s;he was pre&s;ent, &s;ome account of what had pa&s;&s;ed, but briefly; and I had ju&s;t fini&s;hed, and was quitting the room, as the two gentlemen entered the door.</P>
<P>Sir Charles In&s;tantly addre&s;&s;ed me with apologies for
<PB N="196" REF="199">
the concern he had given me. His emotion was vi|&s;ible as he &s;poke to me. He he&s;itated: He trembled. Why did he he&s;itate? Why did he tremble?</P>
<P>I told him, I was not a&s;hamed to own, that I was very much affected by the melancholy &s;tory. The poor Lady, &s;aid I, is greatly to be pitied&mdash;But re|member, Sir, what you promi&s;ed Dr. Bartlett &s;hould do for me.</P>
<P>I have been reque&s;ting the doctor to fulfil my en|gagements.</P>
<P>And I am ready to obey, &s;aid the good man. My agreeable ta&s;k &s;hall &s;oon be performed.</P>
<P>As I was at the door, going up &s;tairs to my clo&s;et, I courte&s;ied, and pur&s;ed my intention.</P>
<P>He bowed, &s;aid nothing, and looked, I thought, as if he were di&s;appointed, that I did not return to company.&mdash;No, indeed!</P>
<P>Yet I pity him, at my heart! How odd is it, then, to be angry with him!&mdash;So much goodne&s;s, &s;o much &s;en&s;ibility, &s;o much compa&s;&s;ion (whence all his woes, I believe), never met together, in a heart &s;o manly.</P>
<P>Tell me, tell me, my dear Lucy&mdash;Yet tell me no|thing till I am favoured with, and you have read, the account that will be given me by Dr. Bartlett: Then, I hope, we &s;hall have every-thing before us.</P>

<P>SIR CHARLES is gone; and I have talked over the matter again with the Ladies and Lord L.</P>
<P>What do you think?&mdash;They all will have it&mdash;and it is a faithful account, to the very <HI>be&s;t</HI> of my recol|lection&mdash;<HI>They all will have it,</HI> That Sir Charles's great &s;truggle, his great grief, is owing&mdash;His great &s;truggle (I don't know what I write, I think&mdash;But let it go) is between his <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> for the unhappy Cle|mentina, and his <HI>Love</HI> &mdash;for&mdash;Somebody el&s;e.</P>
<P>But who, my dear, large as his heart is, can be contented with half an heart? <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> Lucy!&mdash;The compa&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an heart&mdash;It mu&s;t be <HI>Love</HI> &mdash;And ought it not to be &s;o to <HI>&s;uch</HI> a woman?&mdash;Tell me&mdash;Don't you, Lucy, with all <HI>yours,</HI> pity the un|happy Clementina? who loves, again&s;t the principles of her religion; and in that re&s;pect, again&s;t her <HI>in|clination,</HI> a man who cannot be her's, but by a viola|tion of his honour and con&s;cience?

Or, rather, of what ab|&s;urd things does it make its votaries guilty? Let mine be evermore circum&s;cribed by the laws of rea&s;on, of duty; and then my recollections, my reflexions, will never give me la&s;ting di&s;turbance!</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett has de&s;ired me to let him know what the particular pa&s;&s;ages are, of which I more imme|diately

wi&s;h to be informed, for our better under&s;tand|ing the unhappy Clementina's &s;tory, and has promi&s;ed to tran&s;cribe them. I have given him a li&s;t in writing. I have been half guilty of affectation. I have a&s;ked for &s;ome particulars that Sir Charles referred to, which are not &s;o immediately intere&s;ting. The hi&s;tory of Olivia, of Mr. Beaumont; the debates Sir Charles mentioned, between him&s;elf and Signor Jeronymo: But, Lucy, the particulars I am mo&s;t impatient for, are the&s;e:</P>
<P>His fir&s;t conference with Lady Clementina on the &s;ubject of the Count of Belvedere; which her father and mother over-heard.</P>
<P>The conference he was de&s;ired to hold with her, on her being &s;eized with melancholy.</P>
<P>Whether her particularly chearful behaviour, on his departure from Bologna, is any where accounted for.</P>
<P>By what means Mrs. Beaumont prevailed on her to acknowlege a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly concealed from the tendere&s;t of parents.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's reception, on his return from Vienra.</P>
<P>What reception his propo&s;als of compromi&s;e, as to reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters"> and re&s;idence, met with, as well from the fa|mily, as from Clementina.</P>

<P>If the doctor is explicit, with regard to this article, we &s;hall be able to account for their de&s;iring him to revi&s;it them at Bologna, after &s;o long an ab&s;ence, and for his &s;eeming to think it will be to no purpo&s;e to ob|lige them.

<P>DR. Bartlett, &s;eeing our impatience, a&s;ked leave to take the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his nephew in tran&s;cribing from Sir Charles's Letters the pa&s;&s;ages that will enable him to perform the ta&s;k he had &s;o kindly undertaken. By this means, he has already pre&s;ented us with the following tran&s;cripts. We have eagerly peru&s;ed them. When <HI>you</HI> have done &s;o, be plea&s;ed to ha&s;ten them up, that my cou&s;in Reeves's may have the &s;ame opportu|nity. <HI>They</HI> are &s;o good as to give chearfully the pre|ference to the venerable circle, as my cou&s;in, who dined with us ye&s;terday, bid me tell you. O my Lucy! what a glorious young man is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on! But he had the happine&s;s of a Dr. Bartlett, as he is fond of owning, to improve upon a foundation that was &s;o nobly laid, by the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of mothers.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s fir&s;t Letter.</HEAD>
<P>MY ta&s;k, my good Mi&s;s Byron, will be ea&s;y, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance you have allowed me: For what is it, but to tran&s;cribe parts of Sir Charles's Letters, adding a few lines here and there, by way of con|nexion? And I am delighted with it, as it will make known the heart of my beloved patron in all the lights which the mo&s;t intere&s;ting circum&s;tances can throw upon it, to &s;o many worthy per&s;ons as are permitted a &s;hare in this confidence.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of your commands runs thus&mdash;
<Q><PB N="200" REF="203">
<P>I &s;hould imagine, <HI>&s;ay you,</HI> that the debates Sir Charles mentions, between him&s;elf and Signor Jeronymo, and his companions, at their fir&s;t acquaintance, mu&s;t be not only curious, but edi|fying.</P></Q></P>
<P>They <HI>are,</HI> my good Mi&s;s Byron: But as I pre&s;ume that you Ladies are more intent upon being obeyed in the <HI>other</HI> articles [See, Lucy, I had better not have di&s;&s;embled!] I will only at pre&s;ent tran&s;cribe for you, with &s;ome &s;hort connexions, two Letters; by which you will &s;ee how generou&s;ly Mr. Grandi&s;on &s;ought to recover his friend to the paths of virtue and honour, when he had formed &s;chemes, in conjunction with, and by the in&s;tigation of, other gay young men of rank, to draw him in to be a partaker in their guilt, and an abettor of their enterprizes.</P>
<P>You will judge from the&s;e Letters, madam (with|out &s;hocking you by the recital) what were the com|mon-place pleas of tho&s;e libertines, de&s;pi&s;ers of mar|riage, of the laws of &s;ociety, and of WOMEN; but as they were &s;ub&s;ervient to their plea&s;ures.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Barone della <HI>Porretta.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WILL my Jeronymo allow his friend, his Gran|di&s;on, the liberty he is going to take with him? If the friend&s;hip he profe&s;&s;es for him be &s;uch a one, as a great mind can, on reflexion, glory in, he <HI>will.</HI> And what is this liberty, but &s;uch as con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ence of true friend&s;hip? Allow me, on this occa|&s;ion, to &s;ay, that your Grandi&s;on has &s;een more of the world than mo&s;t men, who have lived no longer in it, have had an opportunity to &s;ee. I was &s;ent abroad for improvement, under the care of a man who proved to be the mo&s;t intriguing and profligate of tho&s;e to whom a youth was ever entru&s;ted. I &s;aw in <HI>him,</HI> the inconvenience, the odiou&s;ne&s;s, of libertini&s;m; and, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an excellent monitor, with whom
<PB N="202" REF="204">
I happily became acquainted, and (would it not be fal&s;e &s;hame, and cowardice, if I did not &s;ay) by the Di|vine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I e&s;caped &s;nares that were laid to cor|rupt my morals: Hence my deare&s;t friend will the more readily allow me to impart to him &s;ome of the le&s;&s;ons that were of &s;o much u&s;e to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am the rather encouraged to take this liberty, as I have often flattered my&s;elf, that I have &s;een my Jero|nymo affected by the arguments urged in the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ations that have been held in our &s;elect meetings at Padua, and at Rome; in which the cau&s;e of virtue and true honour has been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and pleaded.</P>
<P>I have now no hopes of influencing any one of the noble youths, whom, at your reque&s;t, I have of late &s;o often met: But of <HI>you</HI> I &s;till have hopes, becau&s;e you continue to declare, that you prefer my friend&s;hip to theirs. You think that I was di&s;gu&s;ted at the ridi|cule with which they generally treated the arguments they could not an&s;wer: But, as far as I innocently could, I followed them in their levity. I returned raillery for ridicule, and not always, as you know, un&s;ucce&s;sfully; but &s;till they renewed the charge, and we had the &s;ame arguments one day to refute, that the preceding were given up. They could not con|vince me, nor I them.</P>
<P>I quit therefore (yet not without regret) the &s;ociety I cannot meet with plea&s;ure: But let not my <HI>Jero|nymo</HI> renounce me. In <HI>his</HI> opinion I had the honour to &s;tand high, before I was prevailed upon to be intro|duced to them; we cultivated, with mutual plea&s;ure, each other's acquaintance, independent of this a&s;&s;ocia|tion. Let us be to each other, what we were for the fir&s;t month of our intimacy. You have noble quali|ties; but are diffident, and too often &s;uffer your&s;elf to be influenced by men of talents inferior to your own.</P>
<P>The ridicule they have aimed at, has weakened, perhaps, the force of the arguments that I wi&s;hed to
<PB N="202" REF="205">
have a more than temporary effect on your heart. Permit me to remind you on paper, of &s;ome of them, and urge to you others: The end I have in view is your good, in hopes to confirm, by the efficacy they may have on you, my own principles: Nor think me too &s;erious. The occa&s;ion, the call that true friend|&s;hip makes upon you, is weighty.</P>
<P>You have &s;hewed me Letters from your noble fa|ther, from your mother, from the pious prelate your brother, and others from your uncle, and &s;till, if po&s;|&s;ible, more admirable ones, from your &s;i&s;ter&mdash;All filled with concern for your pre&s;ent and future wel|fare! How dearly is my Jeronymo beloved by his whole family! and by <HI>&s;uch</HI> a family! And how ten|derly does he love them all&mdash;What ought to be the re&s;ult? Jeronymo cannot be ungrateful. He knows &s;o well what belongs to the character of a dutiful &s;on, an affectionate brother, that I will not attempt to en|force <HI>their</HI> arguments upon him.</P>
<P>By the endeavours of my friend to find excu&s;es for &s;ome of the liberties in which he allows him&s;elf, I infer, that if he thought them criminal, he has too much honour to be guilty of them. He cannot &s;ay, with the mad Medea,
<Q><L>&mdash;Video meliora proboque,</L>
<L>Deteriora &s;equor.&mdash;</L></Q>
No! His judgment mu&s;t be mi&s;led, before he can <HI>al|low</HI> him&s;elf in a deviation. But let him beware; for has not every &s;aulty inclination &s;omething to plead in its own behalf?&mdash;Excu&s;es, my dear friend, are more than tacit confe&s;&s;ions: And the health of the mind, as of the body, is impaired by almo&s;t imper|ceptible degrees.</P>
<P>My Jeronymo has pleaded, and ju&s;tly may he boa&s;t of, a di&s;po&s;ition to benevolence, charity, gene|ro&s;ity&mdash;What pity, that he cannot be &s;till more per|fect!&mdash;that he re&s;olves not again&s;t meditated injuries
<PB N="203" REF="206">
to others of his fellow-creatures! But remember my Lord, that true goodne&s;s is an uniform thing, and will alike influence every part of a man's conduct; and that true genero&s;ity will not be confined to obli|gations, either written or verbal.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, who, tho' in the lea&s;t guilty in&s;tance, and where &s;ome fal&s;e virtue may offer colours to palliate an exce&s;s, can promi&s;e him&s;elf to &s;top, when once he has thrown the reins on the neck of lawle&s;s appetite? And may I not add, that my Jeronymo is not in his own power? He &s;uffers him&s;elf to be a led man!&mdash;O that he would choo&s;e his company anew, and be a leader! Every virtue, then, that warms his heart, would have a &s;i&s;ter-virtue to encourage the noble flame, in&s;tead of a vice to damp it.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tly do you boa&s;t of the nobility of your de&s;cent; of the excellence of every branch of your family. Bear with my que&s;tion, my Lord; Are you determin|ed to &s;it down &s;atisfied with the honour of your ance&s;|tors? Your progenitors, and every one of your family, have given you rea&s;on to applaud their worthine&s;s: Will you not give them cau&s;e to boa&s;t of yours?</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the earne&s;t entreaties of all your friends, that you will marry, you have &s;aid, that, were women angels, you would with joy enter into the &s;tate&mdash;But what ought the <HI>men</HI> to be, who form upon women &s;uch expectations?</P>
<P>Can you, my dear Lord, de&s;pi&s;e matrimony, yet hold it to be a &s;acrament? Can you, defying the maxims of your family, and wi&s;hing to have the Si&s;ter I have heard you mention with &s;uch high de|light and admiration, &s;trengthen your family-intere&s;t in the female line, determine again&s;t adding to its &s;trength in the male?</P>
<P>You have &s;uffered your&s;elf to &s;peak with contempt of the generality of the Italian women, for their illi|teratene&s;s: Let not their misfortune be imputed to them, my noble friend, as their fault. They have the

&s;ame natural genius's that u&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h the men and women of your happy climate. Let not the want of cultivation induce you, a learned man, to hold them cheap. The cau&s;e of virtue, and of the &s;ex, can hardly be &s;eparated.</P>
<P>But, O my friend, my Jeronymo, have I not too much rea&s;on to fear, that guilty attachments have been the cau&s;e of your &s;lighting a legal one? That you are &s;tudying pretences to ju&s;tify the way of life into which you have fallen?</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider the objects of your pur&s;uit&mdash;Alas! there have been more than one: Are they women &s;e|duced from the path of virtue by your&s;elf?&mdash;Who otherwi&s;e perhaps would have married, and made u&s;e|ful members of &s;ociety?&mdash;Con&s;ider, my friend, what a capital crime is a &s;eduction of this kind!&mdash;Can you glory in the virtue of a &s;i&s;ter of your own, and allow your&s;elf in attempts upon the daughter, the &s;i&s;ter, of another? And, let me a&s;k, How can that crime be thought pardonable in a man, which renders a wo|man infamous?</P>
<P>A good heart, a delicate mind, cannot a&s;&s;ociate with a corrupt one. What tie can bind a woman, who has parted with her honour? What, in &s;uch a guilty attachment, mu&s;t be a man's alternative, but either to be the tyrant of a wretch who has given him rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e her, or the dupe of one who de&s;pi&s;es him?</P>
<P>It is the important le&s;&s;on of life (allow me to be &s;erious on a &s;ubject <HI>&s;o</HI> &s;erious) in this union of &s;oul and body, to re&s;train the unruly appetites of the lat|ter, and to improve the faculties of the former&mdash;Can this end be attained by licentious indulgences, and profligate a&s;&s;ociations?</P>
<P>Men, in the pride of their hearts, are apt to &s;up|po&s;e, that nature has de&s;igned them to be &s;uperior to women. The highe&s;t proof that can be given, of &s;uch &s;uperiority, is, in the protection afforded by the
<PB N="205" REF="208">
&s;tronger to the weaker. What can that man &s;ay for him&s;elf, or for his proud preten&s;ion, who employs all his arts to &s;educe, betray, and ruin the creature whom he &s;hould guide and protect&mdash;Sedulous to &s;ave her, perhaps, from every &s;oe, but the devil and him&s;elf!</P>
<P>It is unworthy of a man of &s;pirit to be &s;ollicitous to keep him&s;elf within the boundaries of human laws, on <HI>no other</HI> motive than to avoid the temporal incon|veniencies attending the breach of them. The laws were not made &s;o much for the direction of good men, as to circum&s;cribe the bad. Would a man of honour wi&s;h to be con&s;idered as one of the latter, rather than as one of tho&s;e who would have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the fit from the unfit, had they <HI>not</HI> been di&s;|criminated by human &s;anctions? Men are to approve them&s;elves at an higher tribunal than at that of men.</P>
<P>Shall not public &s;pirit, virtue, and a &s;en&s;e of duty, have as much influence on a manly heart, as a new face? How contemptibly low is that commerce in which <HI>mind</HI> has no &s;hare!</P>
<P>Virtuous love, my dear Jeronymo, looks beyond this temporary &s;cene; while guilty attachments u&s;u|ally find a much earlier period than that of human life. Incon&s;tancy, on one &s;ide or the other, &s;eldom fails to put a di&s;graceful end to them. But were they to endure for <HI>life,</HI> what can the reflexions upon them do towards &s;oftening the agonies of the inevitable hour?</P>
<P>Remember, my Jeronymo, that you are a MAN, a rational and immortal agent; and act up to the dig|nity of your nature. Can &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure be the great end of an immortal &s;pirit in this life?</P>
<P>That plea&s;ure cannot be la&s;ting, and it mu&s;t be fol|lowed by remor&s;e, which is obtained either by doing inju&s;tice to, or degrading, a fellow-creature. And does not a woman, when &s;he forfeits her honour, de|grade her&s;elf, not only in the &s;ight of the world, but in the &s;ecret thoughts of even a profligate lover, de|&s;troying her own con&s;equence with him?</P>

You have heard, my good Mi&s;s Byron, that the friend&s;hip between Mr. Grandi&s;on and Signor Jero|nymo was twice broken off: Once it was, by the un|kindly-taken freedom of the expo&s;tulatory Letter. Je|ronymo, at that time of his life, ill brooked oppo&s;i|tion in any pur&s;uit his heart was engaged in. When pu&s;hed, he was vehement; and Mr. Grandi&s;on could not be over-&s;olicitous to keep up a friend&s;hip with a young man who was under the dominion of his di&s;&s;olute companions; and who would not allow of remon&s;trances, in ca&s;es that concerned his morals.</P>
<P>Jeronymo, having afterwards been drawn into great inconveniencies by his libertine friends, broke with them; and Mr. Grandi&s;on and he meeting by acci|dent at Padua, their friend&s;hip, at the pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tan|ces of Jeronymo, was again renewed.</P>
<P>Jeronymo thought him&s;elf reformed; Mr. Gran|di&s;on hoped he was: But, &s;oon after, a temptation fell in his way, which he could not re&s;i&s;t. It was from a Lady who was more noted for her birth, beauty, and fortune, than for her virtue. She had &s;pread her &s;nares for Mr. Grandi&s;on before Jeronymo became ac|quainted with her; and revenge for her &s;lighted ad|vances taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her heart, &s;he hoped an opportunity would be afforded her of wreaking it upon him.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion was given by the following Letter, which Mr. Grandi&s;on thought him&s;elf obliged, in ho|nour, to write to his friend, on his attachment; the one being then at Padua, the other at Cremona:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I AM extremely concerned, my dear Jeronymo, at your new engagement with a Lady, who, tho' of family and fortune, has &s;hewn but little regard to her character.

But I will not recriminate&mdash;Yet I cannot but regret, that I mu&s;t lo&s;e your company in our projected vi&s;its to the German

courts: This, however, more for your &s;ake than my own; &s;ince to the principal of them I am no &s;tranger. You have excu&s;ed your&s;elf to me; I wi&s;h you had a better motive: But I write rather to warn than to upbraid you. This Lady is mi&s;tre&s;s of all the arts of woman. She may glory in <HI>her</HI> conque&s;t; you ought not to be proud of <HI>yours.</HI> You <HI>will not,</HI> when you know her better. I have had a &s;ingular opportunity of being acquainted with her character. I never judged of characters, of womens e&s;pecially, by <HI>report.</HI> Had the Barone dellaPorretta been the fir&s;t for whom this Lady &s;pread her blandi&s;hments, a man &s;o amiable as he is, might the more a&s;&s;uredly have depended on the love &s;he profe&s;&s;es for him. She has two admirers, men of violence, who, unknown to each other, have equal rea&s;on to look upon her as their own. You propo&s;e not to marry her. I am &s;ilent on this &s;ubject. Would to heaven you <HI>were</HI> married to a woman of virtue! Why will you not oblige all your friends? Thus liable as you are&mdash;But neither do I expo&s;tulate. Well do I know the vehemence with which you are wont to pur&s;ue a new adventure. Yet I <HI>had</HI> hoped&mdash;But again I re&s;train my&s;elf. Only let me add, that the man who &s;hall boa&s;t of his &s;ucce&s;s with this Lady, may have more to apprehend from the competition in which he will find him&s;elf engaged, than he can be aware of. Be prudent, my Jeronymo, in this pur|&s;uit, for your own &s;ake. The heart that dictates this advice is wholly yours: But alas! it boa&s;ts no further intere&s;t in that of its Jeronymo.

<P>And what was the con&s;equence? The unhappy youth, by the in&s;tigation of the revengeful woman, defied his friend, in her behalf. Mr. Grandi&s;on, with a noble di&s;dain, appealed to Jeronymo's cooler deli|beration;

and told him, that he never would meet, as a foe, the man he had ever been de&s;irous to con&s;ider as his friend. You know, my Lord, &s;aid he, that I am under a di&s;advantage in having once been obliged to a&s;&s;ert my&s;elf, in a country where I have no natural connexions; and where you, Jeronymo, have many.

<P>AND now, madam, let me give you, in obedience to your &s;econd command,
<Q><P>The particulars of the conference which Sir Charles was put upon holding with Clementina, in &s;a|vour of the Count of Belvedere; and which her father and mother, unknown to either of them, over-heard.</P></Q>
You mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them &s;eated; a Milton's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t before them: And that, at this time, Mr. Gran|di&s;on did not pre&s;ume that the young Lady had any particular regard for him.</P>
<P><HI>Clementina.</HI> You have taught the prelate, and you have taught the &s;oldier, to be in love with your Milton, Sir: But I &s;hall never admire him, I doubt. Don't you reckon the language hard and crabbed?</P>
<P><HI>Grandi&s;on.</HI> I did not propo&s;e him to you, madam: Your brother cho&s;e him. We &s;hould not have made the proficiency we have, had I not begun with you by ea&s;ier authors. But you have often heard me call him a &s;ublime poet, and your ambition (it is a laudable one) leads you to make him your own too &s;oon.

<P><HI>Gr.</HI> I think, madam, your papa <HI>may</HI> be a little <HI>di&s;plea&s;ed</HI> with you; tho' he loves you too tenderly to be <HI>angry</HI> with you. You reject the Count, without a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Clem.</HI> Is it not rea&s;on enough, that I don't like him?</P>
<P><HI>Gr.</HI> Give me leave to &s;ay, that the Count is an hand&s;ome man. He is young; gallant; &s;en&s;ible; of a family antient and noble; a grace to it. He is learned, good-natured: He adores you&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Clem.</HI> And &s;o let him, if he will, I never can like him.</P>
<P><HI>Gr.</HI> Dear Lady! You mu&s;t not be capricious. You will give the mo&s;t indulgent parents in the world apprehen&s;ion that you have ca&s;t your thoughts on &s;ome other object. Young Ladies, except in a ca&s;e of pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, do not often reject a per&s;on who has &s;o many great and good qualities as thine in this gentle|man; and where equality of degree, and a father's and mother's high approbation, add to his merit.</P>

<P>He begged that, for the &s;ake of their own weight with her on the &s;ame &s;ubject, &s;he might not know that they had heard what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I believe that's be&s;t, Chevalier, an&s;wered the Mar|chione&s;s; and I am apt to think, that the poor girl will be more ready than perhaps one would wi&s;h, to make up with you, were &s;he to find you offended with her in earne&s;t; as you have rea&s;on to be, as a <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted</HI> man.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, Chevalier, I know to whom I am &s;peak|ing; but both my Lord, and &s;elf, hope to &s;ee her of another mind; and that &s;he will &s;oon be Counte&s;s of Belvedere. My Lord's heart is in this alliance; &s;o is that of my &s;on Giacomo.</P>
<P>I come now, madam, to your third command; which is, To give you,
<Q><P>The conference which Sir Charles was put upon holding with the unhappy Clementina, on her being &s;eized with melancholy.</P></Q></P>
<P>[Mr. Grandi&s;on &s;till not pre&s;uming on any parti|cular favour from Clementina.]</P>
<P>The young Lady was walking in one alley of the garden; Mr. Grandi&s;on, and the Marquis and Mar|chione&s;s, in another. She was attended by her wo|man, who walked behind her; and with whom &s;he was di&s;plea&s;ed for endeavouring to divert her; but who, however, &s;eemed to be talking on, tho' without being an&s;wered.</P>
<P>The dear creature! &s;aid the Marquis, tears in his eyes,&mdash;See her there, now walking &s;low, now with quicker &s;teps, as if &s;he would &s;hake off her Camilla. She hates the poor woman for her love to her: But who <HI>is</HI> it that &s;he &s;ees with plea&s;ure? Did I think that I &s;hould ever behold the pride of my heart, with the
<PB N="216" REF="219">
pain that I now feel for her? Yet &s;he is lovely in my eye, in all &s;he does, in all &s;he &s;ays&mdash;But, O my dear Grandi&s;on, we cannot now make her &s;peak, more than Yes, or No. We cannot engage her in a con|ver&s;ation, no not on the &s;ubject of her newly-acquired language. See if you can on <HI>any</HI> &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Ay, Chevalier, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, do you try to engage her. We have told her, that we will not talk of marriage to her at all, till &s;he is her&s;elf inclined to receive propo&s;als. Her weeping eyes thank us for our indulgence: She prays for us with lifted-up hand: She courte&s;ies her thanks, if &s;he &s;tands before us: She bows, in acknowleged gratitude for our goodne&s;s to her, if &s;he &s;its; but &s;he cares not to &s;peak. She is not ea&s;y while we are talking to her. See! &s;he is &s;tepping into the Greek temple; her poor woman, unan&s;wered, talking to her. She has not &s;een us. By that winding walk we can, un&s;een, place our&s;elves in the myrtil-grove, and hear what pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, as we walked, hinted, that in their la&s;t vi&s;it to the General at Naples, there was a Count Marulli, a young nobleman of merit, but a &s;oldier of fortune, who would have clande&s;tinely obtained the attention of their Clementina. They knew no|thing of it till la&s;t night, &s;he &s;aid; when her&s;elf and Camilla, puzzling to what to attribute the &s;udden me|lancholy turn of her daughter, and Camilla mention|ing what was <HI>unlikely,</HI> as well as likely; told her, that the Count would have bribed her to deliver a Letter to the young Lady; but that &s;he repul&s;ed him with indignation: He be&s;ought her then to take no notice of his offer, to the General, on whom all his fortunes depended. She did not, for that rea&s;on, to any-body; but, a few days &s;ince, &s;he heard her young Lady (talk|ing of the gentleman &s;he had &s;een at Naples) mention the young Count favourably&mdash;Now it is impo&s;&s;ible there can be any-thing in it, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s: But do you, however, Chevalier, lead to the &s;ubject of
<PB N="217" REF="220">
Love, but at di&s;tance; nor name Marulli, becau&s;e &s;he will think you have been talking with Camilla. The dear girl has pride: She would not endure you, if &s;he thought you imagined her to be in Love, e&s;pe|cially with a man of inferior degree, or dependent fortunes. But on your prudence we wholly rely; mention it, or not, as matters fall in.</P>
<P>There can be no room for this &s;urmi&s;e, my dear, &s;aid the Marquis; and yet Marulli was lately in Bo|logna: But Clementina's &s;pirit will not permit her to encourage a clande&s;tine addre&s;s.</P>
<P>By this time we had got to the myrtle-grove, be|hind the temple, and over-heard them talk, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Camilla.</HI> And why, why mu&s;t I leave you, ma|dam?&mdash;From infancy you know how I have loved you. You u&s;ed to love to hold conver&s;e with your Camilla. How have I offended you? I will not enter this temple till you give leave; but indeed, indeed, I mu&s;t not, I cannot leave you.</P>
<P><HI>Clem.</HI> Officious Love!&mdash;Can there be a greater torment than an officious prating Love!&mdash;If you lov|ed me, you would wi&s;h to oblige me.</P>
<P><HI>Cam.</HI> I <HI>will</HI> oblige you, my dear young Lady, in every thing I can&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Clem.</HI> Then <HI>leave</HI> me, Camilla. I am <HI>be&s;t</HI> when I am alone: I am <HI>chearfulle&s;t</HI> when I am alone. You haunt me, Camilla; like a gho&s;t you haunt me, Ca|milla. Indeed you are but the gho&s;t of my once ob|liging Camilla.</P>
<P><HI>Cam.</HI> My deare&s;t young Lady, let me be&s;eech you&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Clem.</HI> Ay, now you come with your <HI>be&s;eeches</HI> again: But if you love me, Camilla, leave me. Am I not to be tru&s;ted with my&s;elf? Were I a vile young creature, that was &s;u&s;pected to be running away with &s;ome ba&s;e-born man, you could not be more watchful of my &s;teps.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="221">
Camilla would have entered into farther talk with her; but &s;he ab&s;olutely forbad her.</P>
<P>Talk till dcoms-day, I will not &s;ay one word more to you, Camilla. I will be &s;ilent. I will &s;top my ears.</P>
<P>They were both &s;ilent. Camilla &s;eemed to weep.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Chevalier, whi&s;pered the Marquis, put your&s;elf in her &s;ight; engage her into talk about England, or any-thing: You will have an hour good before dinner. I hope &s;he will be chearful at table: She <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be pre&s;ent; our gue&s;ts will enquire after her. Reports have gone out, as if her head is hurt.</P>
<P>I am afraid, my Lord, that this is an un&s;ea&s;onable moment. She &s;eems to be out of humour; and, par|don me if I &s;ay, that Camilla, good woman as &s;he is, and well-meaning, had better give way to her young Lady's humour, at &s;uch times.</P>
<P>Then, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, will her malady get head; then will it become habit. But my Lord and I will remain where we are, for a few minutes, and do you try to engage her in conver&s;ation. I would have her be chearful before the Patriarch, however; he will expect to &s;ee her. She is as much his delight, as &s;he is ours.</P>
<P>I took a little turn; and entering the walk, which led to the temple, appeared in her &s;ight; but bowed, on &s;eeing her &s;itting in it. Her woman &s;tood &s;ilent, with her handkerchief at her eyes, at the entrance. I quickned my &s;teps, as if I would not break into her retirement, and pa&s;&s;ed by; but, by means of the winding walk, could hear what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e; and &s;tepping forward, looking after me, He iS gone, &s;aid &s;he. Learn, Camilla, of the Che|valier Grandi&s;on&mdash;</P>
<P>Shall I call him back, madam?</P>
<P>No. Yes. No. Let him go. I will walk. You may now leave me, Camilla: There is &s;omebody in the garden who will watch me: Or you may &s;tay,
<PB N="219" REF="222">
Camilla; I don't care which: Only don't talk to me when I wi&s;h you to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>She went into an alley that cro&s;&s;ed the alley in which I was, but took the walk that led from me. When we came to the center of both, and were very near each other, I bowed; &s;he courte&s;ied; but not &s;eeming to encourage my nearer approach, I made a motion, as if I would take another walk. She &s;topt. Learn of the Chevalier Grandi&s;on, Camilla, repeated &s;he.</P>
<P>May I pre&s;ume, madam? Do I not invade&mdash;</P>
<P>Camilla is a little officious to-day: Camilla has teazed me. Are the poets of your country as &s;evere upon womens tongues, as the poets of ours?</P>
<P>Poets, madam, of all countries, boa&s;t the &s;ame in|&s;piration: Poets write, as other men &s;peak, to their <HI>feeling.</HI></P>
<P>So, Sir!&mdash;You make a pretty compliment to us poor women.</P>
<P>Poets have finer imaginations, madam, than other men; they therefore &s;eel quicker: But as they are not often intitled to boa&s;t of Judgment (for imagination and judgment &s;eldom go together) they may, perhaps, <HI>give</HI> the cau&s;e, and then break out into &s;atire upon the effects.</P>
<P>Don't I &s;ee before me, in the Orange-grove, my father and mother? I do. I have not kneeled to them to-day. Don't go, Chevalier.</P>
<P>She ha&s;tened towards them. They &s;topt. She bent her knee to each, and received their tender ble&s;&s;ings. They led her towards me. You &s;eemed engaged in talk with the Chevalier, my dear, &s;aid the Marquis. Your mamma and I were walking in. We leave you&mdash;They did.</P>
<P>The be&s;t of parents! &s;aid &s;he. O that I were a more worthy child!&mdash;Have you not &s;een them, Sir, <HI>before</HI> to day?</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="223">
I have, madam. They think you the worthie&s;t of daughters; but they lament your thoughtful turn.</P>
<P>They are very good. I am grieved to give them trouble. Have they expre&s;&s;ed their concern to you, Sir?&mdash;I will not be &s;o petulant as I was once before, provided you keep clear of the &s;ame &s;ubject. You are the confident of us all; and your noble and di&s;|intere&s;ted behaviour de&s;ervedly endears you to every|body.</P>
<P>They have been this very morning, lamenting the melancholy turn you &s;eem to have taken. With <HI>tears</HI> they have been lamenting it.</P>
<P>Camilla, you may draw near: You will hear your own cau&s;e &s;upported. The rather draw near, and hear all the Chevalier &s;eems to be going to &s;ay; becau&s;e it may &s;ave you and me too a great deal of trouble.</P>
<P>Madam, I have done, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t <HI>not</HI> have done. If you are com|mi&s;&s;ioned, Sir, by my father and mother, I am, I <HI>ought</HI> to be, prepared to hear all you have to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Camilla came up.</P>
<P>My deare&s;t young Lady, &s;aid I, What can I &s;ay? My wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s may make me appear importunate: But what hope have I of obtaining your confidence, when your mother fails?</P>
<P>What, Sir, is aimed at? What is &s;ought to be ob|tained? I am not very well: I u&s;ed to be a very &s;prightly creature: I u&s;ed to talk, to &s;ing, to dance, to play; to vi&s;it, to receive vi&s;its: And I don't like to do any of the&s;e things now. I love to be alone: I am contented with my own company. Other com|pany is, at times, irk&s;ome to me; and I can't help it.</P>
<P>But whence this &s;udden turn, madam, in a Lady &s;o young, &s;o blooming? Your father, mother, bro|thers, cannot account for it; and this di&s;turbs them.</P>
<P>I &s;ee it does, and am &s;orry for it.</P>
<P>No other favourite diver&s;ion takes place in your
<PB N="221" REF="224">
mind. You are a young Lady of exemplary piety: You cannot pay a greater ob&s;ervance than you always paid, to the duties of religion.</P>
<P>You, Sir, an Engli&s;hman, an heretic, give me leave to call you; for are you <HI>not</HI> &s;o?&mdash;Do <HI>you</HI> talk of piety, of religion?</P>
<P>We will not enter into this &s;ubject, madam: What I meant&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, I know what you meant&mdash;And I will own, that I am, at times, a very melancholy &s;trange creature. I know not whence the alteration; but to it is; and I am a greater trouble to my&s;elf than I can be to any-body el&s;e.</P>
<P>But, madam, there mu&s;t be &s;ome cau&s;e&mdash;And for you to an&s;wer the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of mothers with &s;ighs and tears only; yet no ob&s;tinacy, no ful|lenne&s;s, no petulance, appearing: All the &s;ame &s;weet|ne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, ob&s;ervance, that &s;he ever rejoiced to find in her Clementina, &s;till &s;hining out in her mind. She cannot urge her <HI>&s;ilent</HI> daughter; her tenderne&s;s will not permit her to urge her: And how can you, my Si&s;ter (Allow of my claim, madam) How can you &s;till &s;ilently withdraw from &s;uch a mother? How can you, at other times, &s;uffer <HI>her</HI> to withdraw, her heart full, her eyes running over, unable to &s;tay, yet hardly knowing how to go, becau&s;e of the <HI>ineffectual</HI> report &s;he mu&s;t make to your &s;orrowing father; yet the cau&s;e of this very great alteration (which they dread is growing into an habit, at a time of life when you were to crown all their hopes) a Secret fa&s;t locked up in your own heart?</P>
<P>She wept, and turned from me, and leaned upon the arm of her Camilla; and then quitting her arm, and joining me, How you paint my ob&s;tinacy, and my mamma's goodne&s;s! I only wi&s;h&mdash;With all my &s;oul, I wi&s;h&mdash;that I was added to the du&s;t of my ance&s;tors. I who was their comfort, I &s;ee, now, mu&s;t be their torment.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="225">
Fie, fie, my &s;i&s;ter!</P>
<P>Blame me not: I am by no means &s;atisfied with <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> What a mi&s;erable thing mu&s;t &s;he be, who is at variance with her&s;elf?</P>
<P>I do not hope, madam, that you &s;hould place &s;o much confidence in your fourth brother as to open your mind to him: All I beg is, that you will relieve the anxious, the apprehen&s;ive heart of the be&s;t of mothers; and, by &s;o doing, enable her to relieve the equally-anxious heart of the be&s;t of fathers.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed, &s;tood &s;till, turned away her face, and wept; as if half overcome.</P>
<P>Let your faithful Camilla, madam, be commi&s;&s;ioned to acquaint your mamma&mdash;</P>

<P>And pray, <HI>madam</HI> (taking her hand) Do not think of receding thus&mdash;</P>
<P>You are too free, Sir. Yet &s;he withdrew not her hand.</P>
<P>For a brother, madam? Too free for a brother? And I quitted it.</P>
<P>Well, and what farther would my <HI>brother?</HI></P>

<P>Stop, Sir, I be&s;eech you&mdash;What! Whether I have any-thing to reveal, or not?&mdash;Pray, Sir, <HI>tell</HI> me, <HI>invent</HI> for me, a Secret that is fit for me to own; and then, perhaps, if it will &s;ave the trouble of enquiries, I may make, at lea&s;t, my <HI>four</HI> brothers ea&s;y.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed, however, madam, with your agree|able raillery. Continue but in this temper, and the Secret <HI>is</HI> revealed: Enquiry will be at an end.</P>

Camilla, here, is continually teazing me with her <HI>per&s;ua&s;ions</HI> to be <HI>in Love,</HI> as &s;he calls it: That is the &s;illy thing, in our &s;ex, which gives importance to yours.

And if they an&s;wer all your objections, will you act accord|ing to your convictions?</P>
<P>I will not, by any means, madam, enter upon this &s;ubject.</P>

<P>You find, Sir, I have been talkative enough with <HI>you.</HI> &mdash;Shall we go thro' your Shake&s;peare's Hamlet, to-night?&mdash;Farewel, Chevalier. I will try to be chearful at table: But let not your eye, if I am not, reproach me.&mdash;She took another walk.</P>
<P>I was loth, my dear Dr. Bartlett, to impute to my|&s;elf
<PB N="227" REF="230">
the con&s;equence with this amiable Lady, that might but naturally be inferred from the turn which the conver&s;ation took; but I thought it no more than ju&s;tice to the whole family, to ha&s;ten my departure: And when I hinted to Clementina, that I &s;hould &s;oon take leave of them, I was rejoiced to find her un|concerned.</P>
<P>This, my good Mi&s;s Byron, is what I find in my patron's Letters relating to this conference. He takes notice, that the young Lady behaved her&s;elf at table as &s;he was wi&s;hed to do.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on was prevailed upon, by the intrea|ties of the whole family, to &s;u&s;pend his departure for a few days.</P>
<P>The young Lady's melancholy, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible affliction of her friends, increa&s;ed; yet &s;he behaved with &s;o much greatne&s;s of mind, that neither her mother nor her Camilla could per&s;uade them&s;elves that Love was the cau&s;e. They &s;ometimes imagined, that the earne&s;tne&s;s with which they &s;olicited the in|tere&s;t of the Count of Belvedere with her, had hur|ried and affected her delicate &s;pirits; and therefore they were re&s;olved to &s;ay little more on that &s;ubject till they &s;hould &s;ee her di&s;po&s;ed to lend a more fa|vourable ear to it: And the Count retired to his own palace in Parma, expecting and hoping for &s;uch a turn in his favour: For he declared, That it was im|po&s;&s;ible for him to think of any other woman for a wife.</P>
<P>But Signor Jeronymo doubted not, all this time, of the cau&s;e; and, without letting any-body into his opinion, not even Mr. Grandi&s;on, for fear a di&s;ap|pointment would affect him, re&s;olved to make u&s;e of every opportunity that &s;hould offer, in favour of the man he loved, from a principle of gratitude, that reigned with exemplary force in the brea&s;t of every one of this noble family; a principle which took the firmer root in their hearts, as the prudence, genero&s;ity,
<PB N="228" REF="231">
magnanimity, and other great and equally-amiable qualities of Mr. Grandi&s;on, appeared every day more and more con&s;picuous to them all.</P>
<P>I will &s;oon, madam, pre&s;ent you with farther ex|tracts from the Letters in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in pur&s;uance of the articles you have given me in writing. I am not a little proud of my ta&s;k.</P>

</HEADNOTE>
<P>CAN you not, Lucy, gather from the &s;etting-out of this &s;tory, and the &s;hort account of it given by Sir Charles in the Library-conference, that I &s;hall &s;oon pay my duty to you all in Northampton&s;hire? I &s;hall, indeed.</P>
<P>Is it not &s;trange, my dear, that a father and mo|ther, and brothers, &s;o jealous as Italians, in general, are &s;aid to be, of their women; and &s;o proud as this Bologna family is repre&s;ented to be of their rank; &s;hould all agree to give &s;o fine a man, as this is, in mind, per&s;on and addre&s;s, &s;uch free acce&s;s to their daughter, a young Lady of Eighteen?</P>
<P>Teach her Engli&s;h!&mdash;Very di&s;creet in the father and mother, &s;urely! And to commi&s;&s;ion him to talk with the poor girl in favour of a man whom they wi&s;hed her to marry!&mdash;Indeed you will &s;ay, perhaps, that by the <HI>honourable</HI> expedient they fell upon, un|known to either tutor or pupil, of li&s;tening to all that was to pa&s;s in the conference, they found a method to prove his integrity; and that, finding it proof, they were ju&s;tified to prudence in their future confidence.</P>
<P>With all my heart, Lucy: If you will excu&s;e the&s;e parents, you may. But I &s;ay, that <HI>any</HI> body, tho' <HI>not</HI> of Italy, might have thought &s;uch a tutor as this was dangerous to a young Lady; and the more, for being a man of honour and family. In every ca&s;e, the teacher is the obliger. He is called <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> you know: And where there is a <HI>ma&s;ter,</HI> a <HI>&s;ervant</HI> is im|plied.
<PB N="229" REF="232">
Who is it that &s;eeks not out for a married man, among the common tribe of tutors, whether profe&s;&s;ing mu&s;ic, dancing, languages, &s;cience of any kind? But a tutor &s;uch a one as <HI>this</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Well, but I will leave them to pay the price of their indi&s;cretion.</P>
<P>I AM this moment come from the doctor. I in&s;i|nuated to him, as artfully as I could, &s;ome of the above ob&s;ervations. He reminded me, that the Mar|chione&s;s her&s;elf had her education at Paris; and &s;ays, that the manners of the Italians are very much altered of late years; and that the French freedom begins to take place among the people of condition, in a very vi&s;ible manner, of the Italian re&s;erve. The women of the family of Porretta, particularly, he &s;ays, be|cau&s;e of their learning, freedom, and conver&s;ablene&s;s, have been called, by their enemies, Frenchwomen.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ee, that honour, and the laws of ho|&s;pitality, were Mr. Grandi&s;on's guard: And I believe a young flame may be ea&s;ily kept under. But it is a grateful thing, Lucy, to all women, to have a man in Love, whether with our&s;elves, or not; and the more grateful, perhaps, the le&s;s prudent. Yet, <HI>ought</HI> it to be &s;o? Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is u&s;ed to do only what he <HI>ought.</HI> Dr. Bartlett once &s;aid, that the life of a good man was a continual warfare with his pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee, in the &s;econd conference between Mr. Grandi&s;on and the Lady, upon the melancholy way &s;he was in, how artfully, yet, I mu&s;t own, ho|nourably, he reminds her of the <HI>brotherly</HI> character which he pa&s;&s;es under to her! How officiou&s;ly he <HI>&s;i&s;ters</HI> her!</P>
<P>Ah, Lucy! your Harriet is his <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> too, you know! He has been <HI>u&s;ed</HI> to this dialect, and to check the pa&s;&s;ions of us forward girls; and yet I have gone on confe&s;&s;ing mine to the whole venerable circle, and have almo&s;t gloried in it to them. Have not al&s;o his
<PB N="230" REF="233">
&s;i&s;ters detected me? While the noble Clementina, as in that admirable pa&s;&s;age cited by her,</P>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;Never told her love,</L>
<L>But let concealment, like a worm i' th' bud,</L>
<L>Feed on her dama&s;k cheek.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<P>How do I admire her for her &s;ilence! But yet, had &s;he been circum&s;tanced as your Harriet was, would Clementina have been &s;o <HI>very</HI> re&s;erved?</P>
<P>Shall I run a parallel between our two ca&s;es?
<TABLE>
<ROW>
<CELL>Clementina's relations were all &s;olicitous for her marrying the Count of Belvedere, a man of unexceptionable cha|racter, of family, of fortune; and who is &s;aid to be a gallant and an hand&s;ome man, and who adores her, and is of her own faith and country.</CELL>
<CELL>Harriet's relations were all &s;olicitous, from the fir&s;t, for an alliance with their child's deli|verer. They never had encouraged any man's addre&s;s; nor had <HI>&s;he:</HI> And all his neare&s;t and deare&s;t friends were partial to her, and &s;oon grew ardent in her fa|vour.</CELL>

<CELL>What difficulties had Cle|mentina to contend with! It was <HI>great</HI> in her to endeavour to conquer a Love, that &s;he could not, either in duty, or with her judg|ment and con&s;cience, acknowlege.</CELL>
<CELL>Harriet, not knowing of any engagement he had, could have no difficul|ties to contend with; ex|cept inferiority of for|tune were one. She had therefore no rea&s;on to <HI>endeavour</HI> to conquer a pa&s;&s;ion not ignobly founded; and of which duty, judgment, and con&s;cience, approved.</CELL>
</ROW>
<ROW>
<CELL>No wonder, then, that &s;o excellent a young Lady &s;uffered <HI>Concealment,
 like a worm in the bud, to feed on her dama&s;k cheek.</HI></CELL>

And is not &s;u&s;pen&s;e enough to make it pale, tho' it has not yet given it a <HI>green and yellow</HI> ca&s;t? O what tortures has &s;u&s;pen&s;e given me! But certainty is now taking place.</P>
<P>What a right method, Lucy, did Clementina, &s;o much in earne&s;t in her own per&s;ua&s;ion, take, in this &s;econd conference, could &s;he have &s;ucceeded, in her &s;olicitude for his change of religion!&mdash;Could that have been effected, I dare &s;ay &s;he would have been le&s;s re&s;erved, as to the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of her melancholy; e&s;pecially as her friends were all as indulgent to her as mine are to me.</P>
<P>But my pity for the noble Clementina begins to take great hold of my heart. I long to have the whole before me.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, Mar. <HI>28.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LET me now give you a brief account of what we are doing here. Sir Charles &s;o much re|joiced the heart of Lord G. who waited on him the moment he knew he was in town, that he could not defer his attendance on Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, till &s;he left Colnebrooke; and got hither by our breakfa&s;t-time, this morning.</P>
<P>He met with a very kind reception from Lord and Lady L. and a civil one from Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on; but &s;he is already beginning to play her tricks with him.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="235">
O Lucy, where is the &s;en&s;e of parading it with a worthy man, of who&s;e affection we have no rea&s;on to doubt, and who&s;e vi&s;its we allow?</P>
<P>Silly men in Love, or pretending to be in Love, generally &s;ay hyperbolical things, all, in &s;hort, that could be &s;aid to a creature of &s;uperior order (to an angel), becau&s;e they know not how to &s;ay polite, proper, or &s;en&s;ible things. In like manner, from the &s;ame defects in under&s;tanding, &s;ome of us women act as if we thought coyne&s;s and mode&s;ty the &s;ame thing; and others, as if they were &s;en&s;ible, that if they were not in&s;olent, they mu&s;t drop into the arms of a Lover upon his fir&s;t que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, in her behaviour to Lord G. is governed by motives of archne&s;s, and, I may &s;ay, downright roguery of temper. Court&s;hip is play to her. She has a talent for raillery, and in no in&s;tance is &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, yet &s;o improper, as on that &s;ubject. She could not &s;pare her brother upon it, tho' &s;he &s;uf|fered by it.</P>
<P>Yet had &s;he a re&s;pect for Lord G. &s;he could not treat him ludicrou&s;ly. Cannot a witty woman find her own con&s;equence, but by putting a fool's coat on the back of a friend?&mdash;Sterling wit, I imagine, re|quires not a foil to &s;et it off.</P>
<P>She is indeed good-natured; and this is all Lord G. has to depend upon&mdash;Saving a little reliance that he may make upon the influence her brother has over her. I told her, ju&s;t now, that were I Lord G. I would not wi&s;h to have her mine, on any con&s;idera|tion. She called me &s;illy creature, and a&s;ked me, If it were not one of the true&s;t &s;igns of Love, when men were mo&s;t fond of the women who were lea&s;t fit for them, and u&s;ed them wor&s;t? The&s;e men, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, are very &s;orry creatures, and know no me|dium. They will either, &s;paniel-like, fawn at your feet, or be ready to leap into your lap.</P>
<P>She has charming &s;pirits: I wi&s;h I could borrow
<PB N="233" REF="236">
&s;ome of them. But I tell her, that I would not have a &s;ingle drachm of tho&s;e over-lively ones which I &s;ee &s;he will <HI>play off</HI> upon Lord G. Yet he will be plea&s;|ed, at pre&s;ent, with any treatment from her; tho' he wants not feeling, as I can &s;ee already&mdash;Don't, Char|lotte, &s;aid I to her, within this half-hour, let him find his own weight in your levity. He admires your wit; but don't let it wound him.</P>
<P>But perhaps &s;he is the &s;prightlier, in order to give me, and Lord and Lady L. &s;pirits. They are very good to me, and greatly apprehen&s;ive of the &s;tory, which takes up, in a manner, my whole attention: So is Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: And my &s;weet Emily, as often as &s;he may, comes up to me when I am alone, and hangs upon my arm, my &s;houlder, and watches, with looks of Love, every turn of my eyes.</P>
<P>I have opened my whole heart to her, for the bet|ter guarding of hers; and this hi&s;tory of Clementina affords an excellent le&s;&s;on for the good girl. She ble&s;&s;es me for the lectures I read her on this &s;ubject, and &s;ays, that &s;he &s;ees Love is a very &s;ubtile thing, and, like water, will work its way into the banks that are &s;et up to confine it, if it be not watched, and damned out in time.</P>
<P>She pities Clementina; and prettily a&s;ked my leave to do &s;o. I think, &s;aid &s;he, my <HI>heart</HI> loves her; but not &s;o well as it does you. I long to know what my guardian will do about her. How <HI>good</HI> is it in her father and mother to love her &s;o dearly! Her two elder brothers one cannot di&s;like; but Jeronymo is my fa|vourite. He is a man worth &s;aving; i'n't he, madam? But I pity her father and mother, as well as Clementina.</P>
<P>Charming young creature! What an excellent heart &s;he has!</P>
<P>Sir Charles is to dine with Sir Hargrave and his friends to-morrow, on the fore&s;t, in his way to Gran|di&s;on-hall. The doctor &s;ays, he expects to hear from him, when there. What! will he go by this hou&s;e,
<PB N="234" REF="237">
and not call in?&mdash;With all my heart&mdash;We are <HI>only</HI> &s;i&s;ters! Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;ays, &s;he'll be <HI>hanged</HI> (that is her word) if he is not <HI>afraid of me.</HI> Afraid of me! A &s;ign, if he is, he knows not what a poor forward creature I am. But as he &s;eems to be pre-engagged&mdash;Well, but I &s;hall &s;oon know every thing, as to that. But &s;ure he might call in, as he went by.</P>
<P>The doctor &s;ays, he longs to know how he ap|proves of the decorations of his church, and of the alterations that are made and making, by his direction, at the Hall. It is a wonder, methinks, that he takes not Dr. Bartlett with him: Upon my word, I think he is a little unaccountable, &s;uch &s;i&s;ters as he has. Should <HI>you</HI> like it, Lucy, were he <HI>your</HI> brother? I really think his &s;i&s;ters are too acquie&s;cent.</P>
<P>He has a great ta&s;te, the doctor tells us, yet not an expen&s;ive one; for he &s;tudies &s;ituation and conveni|ence; and pretends not to level hills, or to force and di&s;tort nature; but to help it, as he finds it, without letting art be &s;een in his works, where he can po&s;&s;ibly avoid it. For he &s;ays, He would rather let a &s;tranger be plea&s;ed with what he &s;ees, as if it were <HI>always</HI> &s;o; than to obtain comparative prai&s;e by informing him what it was in its former &s;ituation.</P>
<P>As he is to be a &s;uitor for Lord W. before he re|turns, he will not, perhaps, be with us, while I am here. He <HI>may</HI> court for others: He has had very little trouble of that &s;ort for him&s;elf, I find.</P>
<P>A very di&s;turbing thought is ju&s;t come into my head: Sir Charles being him&s;elf in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, as to the cata&s;trophe of this knotty affair, did not intend to let us know it till all was over&mdash;As &s;ure as you are alive, Lucy, he had &s;een my regard for him thro' the thin veil that covered it; and began to be apprehen&s;ive <HI>(generou&s;ly</HI> apprehen&s;ive) for the heart of the poor fool; and &s;o has &s;uffered Dr. Bartlett to tran&s;cribe the particulars of the &s;tory, that they may &s;erve for a check to the over-forward pa&s;&s;ion of your Harriet.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="238">
<HI>This</HI> thought excites my pride; and <HI>that</HI> my con|tempt of my&s;elf: Near borderers, Lucy! What a little creature does it make me, in my own eyes!&mdash;O Dr. Bartlett, your kindly-intended tran&s;cripts &s;hall cure me: Indeed they &s;hall.</P>
<P>But now this &s;ubject is got uppermo&s;t again. What, Lucy, can I do with it?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;ays, that I &s;hall be with her every day when I go to town: I can have no exception, &s;he &s;ays, when her brother is <HI>ab&s;ent</HI> &mdash;Nor when he is <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> I begin now to think.</P>
<P>Lord help me, my dear; I mu&s;t be &s;o very careful of my ponctilio!&mdash;No, thought I, in the true &s;pirit of prudery, I will not go to Sir Charles's hou&s;e for the world: And why? Becau&s;e he is a &s;ingle man; and becau&s;e I think of &s;omething&mdash;that he perhaps has no notion of. But now I may go and vi&s;it his &s;i&s;ter without &s;cruple, may I not? For he perhaps thinks only of his Clementina&mdash;And is not this a charming difficulty got over, Lucy?&mdash;But, as I &s;aid, I will <HI>&s;oon</HI> be with you.</P>
<P>I told Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on that I <HI>would,</HI> ju&s;t now&mdash;Lovers, &s;aid &s;he, are the weake&s;t people in the world; and people of punctilio the mo&s;t <HI>un</HI> -punctilious&mdash;You have not talked till <HI>now</HI> of going in &s;uch an hurry. Would you have it thought that you &s;tayed in town for a <HI>particular</HI> rea&s;on? and, when that cea&s;ed, va|lued nobody el&s;e? She held up her finger&mdash;Con&s;ider! &s;aid &s;he!</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in this, Lucy. Yet what <HI>can</HI> I do?</P>
<P>But Dr. Bartlett &s;ays, he &s;hall &s;oon give me another Letter.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wedne&s;day, Mar. <HI>29.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SIR Charles came hither this morning, time enough to breakfa&s;t with us.</P>
<P>Lady L. is not an early ri&s;er. I am &s;ure this bro|ther of hers is: So is Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. If I &s;ay I <HI>am,</HI> my Lucy, I will not allow you to call it boa&s;ting, becau&s;e you will, by &s;o calling it, acknowlege Early ri&s;ing to be a virtue; and if you thought it &s;uch, I am &s;ure you would di&s;tingui&s;h it by your practice. Forgive me, my dear: This is the only point in which you and I have differed&mdash;And why have I in the main &s;o patiently &s;uffered this difference, and not tried to teaze you out of it? Becau&s;e my Lucy always <HI>&s;o well</HI> employs her time when &s;he is <HI>alive.</HI> But would not one the more wi&s;h that well-employed life to be made as long as po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>I endeavoured to be very chearful at breakfa&s;t; but I believe my behaviour was aukward, and affected. After Sir Charles was gone, on my putting the que|&s;tion to the two &s;i&s;ters, Whether it was not &s;o? they acquitted me&mdash;Yet my heart, when in his company, laboured with a &s;en&s;e of con&s;traint.</P>
<P>My pride made me want to find out pity for me in his looks and behaviour, on purpo&s;e to quarrel with him in my mind; for I could not get out of my head that degrading &s;urmi&s;e, that he had permitted Dr. Bart|lett to ha&s;ten to me the hi&s;tory of Clementina, in order <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> to check any hopes that I might en|tertain, before they had too &s;trongly taken hold of my fooli&s;h heart.</P>
<P>But nothing of this was di&s;coverable. Re&s;pect, ten|der re&s;pect, appeared, as the Ladies afterwards took
<PB N="237" REF="240">
notice, in every word, when he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me; in every look that he ca&s;t upon me.</P>
<P>He &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided &s;peaking of the Bologna fa|mily. We were not indeed any of us fond of leading to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure, I pitied <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Pity, my dear, is a &s;ofter pa&s;&s;ion, I dare &s;ay, in the bo&s;om of a woman, than in that of a man. There <HI>is,</HI> there <HI>mu&s;t be,</HI> I &s;hould fancy, more gene|ro&s;ity, more tenderne&s;s, in the pity of the one, than in that of the other. In a man's pity (I write in the fir&s;t ca&s;e from my own &s;en&s;ibilities, in the other from my apprehen&s;ions) there is, too probably, a mixture of in&s;ult or contempt. Unhappy, indeed, mu&s;t the woman be, who has drawn upon her the <HI>helple&s;s</HI> pity of the man &s;he loves!</P>
<P>The Ladies and Lord L. will have it, that Sir Charles's <HI>Love,</HI> however, is not &s;o much engaged for Clementina as his <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion.</HI> They are my &s;incere friends: They &s;ee that I am pretty delicate in my no|tions of a fir&s;t Love; and they generou&s;ly endeavour to inculcate this di&s;tinction upon me: But to what purpo&s;e, when we evidently &s;ee, from what we al|ready know of this &s;tory, that his engagements, be the motive what it will, are of &s;uch a nature, that they cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with while this Lady's de&s;ti|ny is undetermined?</P>
<P>Poor Lady Clementina! From my heart I pity her: And tenderne&s;s, I am &s;ure, is the &s;ole motive of my compa&s;&s;ion for this fair Unfortunate.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;et out, immediately after breakfa&s;t, for Sir Hargrave's. He will dine with him, and intends to pa&s;s the evening with Lord W. We &s;hall all go to town to-morrow.</P>
<P>WITH this I &s;end the doctor's &s;econd pacquet. O my dear! What a noble young Lady is Clementina! What a purity is there in her pa&s;&s;ion! A Letter of
<PB N="238" REF="241">
Mrs. Beaumout (Mrs. Beaumont her&s;elf an excellent woman) will &s;hew you, that Clementina de&s;erves every good wi&s;h. Such a noble &s;truggle did I never hear of, between Religion and Love. O Lucy! you will be delighted with Clementina: You will even, for a while, forget your Harriet; or, if you are ju&s;t, will think of her but next after Clementina! Never did a young Lady do more honour to her &s;ex, than is done it by Clementina! A flame, the mo&s;t vehement, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed from motives of piety, till, poor Lady! it has devoured her intellects!</P>
<P>Read the Letter, and be lo&s;t, as I was, for half an hour after I had read it, in &s;ilent admiration of her fortitude! O my dear! &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be rewarded with a Sir Charles Grandi&s;on! My rea&s;on, my ju&s;tice, com|pels from me my vote in her favour.</P>
<P>My Lord L. and the two Ladies admire her as much as I do. They look at me with eyes of tender concern. They &s;ay little. What <HI>can</HI> they &s;ay?&mdash;But they kindly applaud me for unfeigned admi|ration of this extraordinary young Lady. But where is <HI>my</HI> merit? Who can forbear admiring her?</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s &s;econd Letter.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR forth enquiry, madam, is,</P>
<P><HI>Whether the particularly chearful behaviour of the young Lady, on the departure of Mr. Grandi&s;on from Bologna, after a cour&s;e of melancholy, is any|where accounted for?</HI></P>
<P>And your fifth is, <HI>What were the particulars of Mrs. Beaumont's management of the Lady, at Flo|rence, by which &s;he brought her to own her Love, after &s;he had &s;o long kept it a &s;ecret from her mo|ther, and all her family?</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>What I &s;hall tran&s;cribe, in order to &s;atisfy you, madam, with regard to the fifth article, will include all that you can wi&s;h to be informed of, re&s;pecting the fourth.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="242">
But let me premi&s;e, That Mrs. Beaumont, at the reque&s;t of the Marchione&s;s, undertook to give an ac|count of the health of the young Lady, and what effect the change of air, of place, and her advice, had upon her mind, after &s;he had been at Florence for two or three days. She, on the fourth day of their being together, wrote to that Lady the de&s;ired parti|culars. The following is a tran&s;lation of her Letter:</P>
<P>YOUR Lady&s;hip will excu&s;e me for not writing till now, when you are acquainted that it was not before la&s;t night that I could give you any tole|rable &s;atisfaction on the &s;ubject upon which I had en|gaged to do my&s;elf that honour.</P>
<P>I have made my&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of the dear young Lady's Secret. Your Lady&s;hip gue&s;&s;ed it, perhaps, too well. Love, but a pure and laudable Love, is the malady that has robbed her of her tranquillity for &s;o long a &s;pace, and your &s;plendid family of all com|fort: But &s;uch a magnanimity, &s;hewn or endeavoured at, that &s;he de&s;erves to be equally pitied and admired. What is it that the dear young Lady has not &s;uffered in a conflict between her duty, her Religion, and her Love?</P>
<P>The di&s;covery, I am afraid, will not give plea&s;ure to your family; yet certainty, in what mu&s;t be, is better than &s;u&s;pen&s;e. You will think me a managing per&s;on, perhaps, from the relation I have to give you: But it was the task pre&s;cribed me; and you com|manded me to be very minute in the account of all my dealings with her, that you might know how to conduct your&s;elves to her for the cure of the unhappy malady. I obey.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;econd days, after our return to Flo|rence, were pa&s;&s;ed in endeavouring to divert her, as our gue&s;t, in all the ways we could think of: But finding, that company was irk&s;ome to her, and that &s;he only bore with it for politene&s;s &s;ake; I told the La|dies,
<PB N="240" REF="243">
that I would take her entirely into my own care, and devote my whole time to her &s;ervice. They acquie&s;ced. And when I told Lady Clemen|tina of my intention, &s;he rejoiced at it, and did me the honour to a&s;&s;ure me, that my conver&s;ation would be balm to her heart, if &s;he could enjoy it without mixt company.</P>
<P>Your Lady&s;hip will &s;ee, however, from what I have mentioned of her regard for me, that I had made u&s;e of my time in the two pa&s;ts days to ingratiate my&s;elf into the favour of your Clementina. She will have me call her nothing but Clementina: Excu&s;e there|fore, madam, the freedom of my &s;tile.</P>
<P>She engaged me la&s;t night to give her a le&s;&s;on, as &s;he called it, in an Engli&s;h author. I was &s;urpri&s;ed at her proficiency in my native tongue. Ah my dear! &s;aid I, what an admirable manner of teaching mu&s;t your tutor have had, if I am to judge by the great progre&s;s you have made in &s;o &s;hort a time, in the acquiring of a tongue that has not the &s;weetne&s;s of your own, tho' it has a force and expre&s;&s;ivene&s;s that is more than equal, I think, to any of the mo|dern languages!</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed&mdash;Do you think &s;o? &s;aid &s;he&mdash;And I &s;aw, by the turn of her eye, and her con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that I had no need to hint to her Count Marulli, nor any other man.</P>
<P>I took upon me, without pu&s;hing her, ju&s;t then, upon the &s;uppo&s;ed light dropt in from this little in|cident, to mention the Count of Belvedere with di|&s;tinction, as the Marquis had de&s;ired I would.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, She could not by any means think of him.</P>
<P>I told her, that as all her family approved highly of the Count, I thought they were intitled to know her objections; and to judge of the rea&s;onablene&s;s or unrea&s;onablene&s;s of them. Indeed, my dear, &s;aid I, you do not, in this point, treat your father and mo|ther with the dutifulne&s;s that their indulgence de|&s;erves.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="244">
She &s;tarted. That is &s;everely &s;aid, is it not, madam?</P>
<P>Con&s;ider of it, my dear, and if you pronounce it &s;o, after an hour's reflection, I will call it &s;o, and a&s;k your pardon.</P>
<P>I am afraid, &s;aid &s;he, I am in fault. I have the be&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent of parents. There are &s;ome things, &s;ome &s;ecrets, that one cannot be forward to divulge. One &s;hould perhaps be commanded out of them with a high hand.</P>
<P>Your acknowlegement, my dear, &s;aid I, is more generous than the occa&s;ion given for it: But if you will not think me impertinent&mdash;</P>
<P>Don't, don't, a&s;k me too clo&s;e que&s;tions, madam, interrupted &s;he; I am afraid I can deny nothing.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, my dear Clementina, that the mu|tual unbo&s;oming of &s;ecrets is the cement of faithful Friend&s;hip, and true Love. Whenever any new turn in one's affairs happens, whenever any new lights open, the friendly heart re&s;ts not, till it has commu|nicated to its fellow-heart the new lights, the inte|re&s;ting events; and this communicativene&s;s knits the true Lover's knot &s;till clo&s;er. But what a &s;olitari|ne&s;s, what a gloom, what a darkne&s;s, mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s that mind that can tru&s;t no friend with its inmo&s;t thoughts! The big &s;ecret, when it is of an intere&s;t|ing nature, will &s;well the heart till it is ready to bur&s;t, Deep melancholy mu&s;t follow&mdash;I would not for the world have it &s;o much as thought, that I had not a &s;oul large enough for friend&s;hip. And is not the e&s;&s;ence of friend&s;hip communication, mingling of hearts, and emptying our very &s;oul into that of a true friend?</P>
<P>Why that's true. But, madam, a young creature may be &s;o circum&s;tanced, as not to have a true friend; or, if &s;he has near her a per&s;on to whom &s;he <HI>might</HI> communicate her whole mind without doubt of her <HI>fidelity;</HI> yet there may be a forbiddingne&s;s in the
<PB N="242" REF="245">
per&s;on; a difference in years, in degree; as in my Camilla, who is, however, a very good woman&mdash;We people of condition, madam, have more courtiers about us than friends: But Camilla's fault is teazing, and always harping upon one &s;tring, and that by my friends commands: It would be therefore more lau|dable to open my mind to my mother, than to her; as it would be the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>Very true, my dear: And as you have a mother, who is le&s;s of the mother than &s;he would be of the &s;i&s;ter, the friend; it is amazing to me, that you have kept &s;uch a mother in the dark &s;o long.</P>
<P>What can I &s;ay?&mdash;Ah, madam!&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt. At la&s;t &s;aid, But my mother is in the intere&s;t of the man I cannot love.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion recurs&mdash;Are not your parents intitled to know your objections to the man who&s;e intere&s;t they &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;e?</P>
<P>I have no particular objections. The Count of Belvedere de&s;erves a better wife than I can make him. I &s;hould re&s;pect him very much, had I a &s;i&s;ter, and he made his addre&s;&s;es to her.</P>
<P>Well then, my dear Clementina, if I <HI>gue&s;s</HI> the rea&s;on why you cannot approve of the Count of Bel|vedere, will you tell me, with that candor, with that friend&s;hip, of the requi&s;ites of which we have been &s;peaking, whether I am right or not?</P>
<P>She he&s;itated. I was &s;ilent in expectation.</P>
<P>She then &s;poke, I am <HI>afraid</HI> of you, madam.</P>
<P>You have rea&s;on to be &s;o, if you think me unwor|thy of your friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>What is your gue&s;s?</P>
<P>That you are prejudiced in favour of &s;ome other man; or you could not, if you had a &s;i&s;ter, wi&s;h her an hu&s;band that you thought unworthy of your&s;elf.</P>
<P>I don't think the Count of Belvedere unworthy neither, madam.</P>
<P>Then my conjecture has received additional &s;trength.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="246">
O Mrs. Beaumont! How you pre&s;s upon me!</P>
<P>If impertinently, &s;ay &s;o; and I have done.</P>
<P>No, no, not impertinently, neither; yet you di|&s;tre&s;s me.</P>
<P>That could not be, if I were not right; and if the per&s;on were not too unworthy of you, to be acknow|leged.</P>
<P>O Mrs. Beaumont! how clo&s;ely you urge me! What can I &s;ay?</P>
<P>If you have any confidence in me&mdash;If you think me capable of advi&s;ing you&mdash;</P>
<P>I <HI>have</HI> confidence: Your known prudence&mdash;And then &s;he made me compliments, that I could not de|&s;erve.</P>
<P>Come, my dear Clementina, I will <HI>gue&s;s</HI> again&mdash;Shall I?</P>
<P>What would you gue&s;s?</P>
<P>That there is a man of low degree&mdash;Of low for|tunes&mdash;Of inferior &s;en&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Hold, hold, hold&mdash;And do you think that the Cle|mentina before you is &s;unk <HI>&s;o</HI> low?&mdash;If you do, Why don't you ca&s;t the abject creature from you?</P>
<P>Well, then, I will <HI>gue&s;s</HI> again&mdash;That there is a man of a royal hou&s;e; of &s;uperior under&s;tanding; of whom you can have no hope.</P>
<P>O Mrs. Beaumont! And cannot you gue&s;s that this prince is a Mahometan, when your hand is in?</P>
<P>Then, madam, and from the hints your Lady&s;hip had given, I had little doubt that Clementina was in Love; and that religion was the apprehended diffi|culty. Zealous Catholics think not better of Pro|te&s;tants, than of Mahometans: Nor, indeed, are zealous Prote&s;tants without their prejudices. Zeal will be zeal, in per&s;ons of whatever denomina|tion.</P>
<P>I would not however, madam, like a &s;udden fro&s;t, nip the opening bud.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="247">
There is, &s;aid I, a young &s;oldier of fortune, who has breathed forth pa&s;&s;ionate wi&s;hes for Clementina.</P>
<P>A &s;oldier of fortune, madam! with an air of di&s;|dain. There cannot be &s;uch a man living, that can have his wi&s;hes an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Well, then, to &s;ay nothing of <HI>him;</HI> there is a Roman nobleman&mdash;a younger brother&mdash;of the Bor|ghe&s;e hou&s;e&mdash;Permit me to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>him</HI> the man.</P>
<P>With all my heart, madam.</P>
<P>She was ea&s;y, while I was at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>But if the Chevalier Grandi&s;on [She coloured at his name] has done him ill offices&mdash;</P>
<P>The Chevalier Grandi&s;on, madam, is incapable of doing <HI>any</HI> man ill offices.</P>
<P>Are you &s;ure, madam, that the Chevalier has not art?&mdash;He has great abilities. Men of great abilities are not always to be tru&s;ted. They don't &s;trike till they are &s;ure.</P>
<P>He has <HI>no</HI> art, madam. He is <HI>above</HI> art. He <HI>wants</HI> it not. He is beloved where-ever he goes. He is equally noted for his prudence and freedom of heart. He is <HI>above</HI> art, repeated &s;he, with warmth.</P>
<P>I own, that he de&s;erves every-thing from your fa|mily. I don't wonder that he is care&s;&s;ed by you all: But it is amazing to me, that, in contradiction to all the prudent maxims and cautions of your country, &s;uch a young gentleman &s;hould have been admitted&mdash;I &s;lopt.</P>
<P>Why, now, you don't imagine, that I&mdash;that I&mdash;She &s;topt, and he&s;itated.</P>
<P>A prudent woman would not put it in any man's power to give her a prejudice to per&s;ons of unexcep|tionable honour; and to manage&mdash;</P>
<P>Nay, madam, now has &s;omebody prejudiced you again&s;t your countryman&mdash;He is the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;|ted of men.</P>
<P>I have heard young Ladies, when he was here, &s;peak of him as an hand&s;ome man.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="248">
An hand&s;ome man! And is not Mr. Grandi&s;on an hand&s;ome man? Where will you &s;ee a man &s;o hand|&s;ome?</P>
<P>And do you think he is &s;o <HI>very</HI> extraordinary a man, as to <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> as I have heard him reported to be? I was twice in his company&mdash;I thought, indeed, he looked upon <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as a man of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Nay, madam, don't &s;ay he is not a <HI>mode&s;t</HI> man. It is true, he knows when to &s;peak, and when to be &s;ilent: But he is not a confident man; nor is he, in the lea&s;t, conceited.</P>
<P>Was there &s;o much bravery in his relieving your brother, as &s;ome people attribute to him in that happy event? Two &s;ervants and him&s;elf, well armed; the chance of pa&s;&s;engers on the &s;ame road: The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins that appeared but two; their own guilt to encounter with&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear, dear Mrs. Beaumont, with what prejudiced people have you conver&s;ed? The Scripture &s;ays, <HI>A prophet has no honour in his own country;</HI> but Mr. Grandi&s;on has not much from his own country|woman.</P>
<P>Well, but did Mr. Grandi&s;on ever &s;peak to you of any one man as a man worthy of your favour?</P>
<P>Did he!&mdash;Yes, of the Count of Belvedere. He was <HI>more</HI> earne&s;t in his favour&mdash;</P>
<P>Really?</P>
<P>Yes, really&mdash;than I thought he ought to be.</P>
<P>Why &s;o?</P>
<P>Why &s;o!&mdash;Why, becau&s;e&mdash;becau&s;e&mdash;Why what was it to him&mdash;you know?</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e he was put upon it&mdash;</P>
<P>I believe &s;o.</P>
<P>Or he would not&mdash;</P>
<P>I believe, if the truth were known, you, Mrs. Beaumont, hate Mr. Grandi&s;on. You are the only per&s;on that I ever in my life heard &s;peak of him, even with indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="249">
Tell me, my dear Clementina, What are you &s;in|cere thoughts of Mr. Grandi&s;on, per&s;on and mind?</P>
<P>You may gather them from what I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>That he is an hand&s;ome man; a generous, a pru|dent, a brave, a polite man.</P>
<P>Indeed I think him to be all you have &s;aid: And I am not &s;ingular.</P>
<P>But he is a <HI>Mahometan</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>A <HI>Mahometan!</HI> madam&mdash;Ah, Mrs. Beaumont!</P>
<P>And ah, my dear Clementina!&mdash;And do you think I have not found you out?&mdash;Had you never known Mr. Grandi&s;on, you would not have &s;crupled to have been Counte&s;s of Belvedere.</P>
<P>And can you think, madam&mdash;</P>
<P>Yes, yes, my dear young Lady, I can.</P>
<P>My good Mrs. Beaumont, you don't know what I was going to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Be &s;incere, my dear young Lady. Cannot a Lover, talking to a &s;econd per&s;on, be &s;incere?</P>
<P>What! madam, a man of another religion! A man ob&s;tinate in his errors! a man who has never pro|fe&s;&s;ed Love to me! a man of inferior degree! A man who owns him&s;elf ab&s;olutely dependent upon his father's bounty! His father living to the height of his e&s;tate!&mdash;Forbid it pride, dignity of birth, duty, religion&mdash;</P>
<P>Well then, I may &s;afely take up the prai&s;es of Mr. Grandi&s;on: You have imputed to me, &s;light, in|ju&s;tice, prejudice again&s;t him: Let me now &s;hew you, that the <HI>Prophet</HI> HAS <HI>honour with his country|woman.</HI> Let me collect his character from the mouth of every man who has &s;poken of him in my hearing or knowlege&mdash;His country has not in this age &s;ent abroad a private man who has done it more credit. He is a man of honour in every &s;en&s;e of the word: If moral rectitude, if practical religion (your brother the Barone te&s;tifies this on his own experience) were lo&s;t in the re&s;t of the world, it would, without glare
<PB N="247" REF="250">
or o&s;entation, be found in him. He is courted by the be&s;t, the wi&s;e&s;t, the mo&s;t eminent men, where|ever he goes; and he does good without di&s;tinction of religion, &s;ects, or nation: His own countrymen boa&s;t of him, and apply to him for credentials to the be&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable men, in their travels thro' more countries than one: In France, particularly, he is as much re&s;pected as in Italy. He is de&s;cended from the be&s;t families in England, both by father and mother; and can be a Senator of it, whenever he plea&s;es. He is heir to a very con&s;iderable e&s;tate, and is, as I am informed, courted to ally with &s;ome of the greate&s;t families in it. Were he not born to a fortune, he would make one. You own him to be generous, brave, hand&s;ome&mdash;</P>
<P>O my dear, dear Mrs. Beaumont! All this is too much, too much!&mdash;Yet all this I think him to be! I can no longer re&s;i&s;t you. I own, I own, that I have no heart but for Mr. Grandi&s;on. And now, as I don't doubt but my friends &s;et you to find out the love-&s;ick girl, how &s;hall I, who cannot di&s;own a &s;ecret you have &s;o fairly, and without condition, come at, ever look them in the face? Yet let them know, (I will enable you to tell them) how all this came about, and how much I have &s;truggled again&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o evidently improper to be encouraged by a daughter of their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He was, in the fir&s;t place, as well you know, the pre&s;erver of a beloved brother's life; and that brother afterwards owned, that had he followed his friendly advice, he never would have fallen into the danger from which he re&s;cued him.</P>
<P>My father and mother pre&s;ented him to me, and bid me regard him as a fourth brother; and it was not immediately that I found out that I <HI>could</HI> have but three brothers.</P>
<P>My brother's deliverer proved to be the mo&s;t ami|able and humane, and yet brave&s;t of men.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="251">
All my friends care&s;&s;ed him. Neither family forms, nor national forms, were &s;tood upon. He had free acce&s;s to us all, as one of us.</P>
<P>My younger brother was continually hinting to me his wi&s;hes that I were his. Mr. Grandi&s;on was above all other reward; and my brother con&s;idered me in a kind light, as <HI>able</HI> to reward him.</P>
<P>My confe&s;&s;or, by his fears and invectives, rather confirmed than le&s;&s;ened my e&s;teem for a man whom I thought injured by them.</P>
<P>His own re&s;pectful and di&s;intere&s;ted behaviour to me contributed to my attachment. He always ad|dre&s;&s;ed me as his <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> when he put on the familiar friend, in the gui&s;e of a tutor: I could not therefore arm again&s;t a man I had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect.</P>
<P>But &s;till I knew not the &s;trength of my pa&s;&s;ion for him, till the Count of Belvedere was propo&s;ed to me with an earne&s;tne&s;s that alarmed me: Then I con&s;i|dered the Count as the interrupter of my hopes; and yet I could not give the rea&s;on <HI>why</HI> I rejected him. How <HI>could</HI> I, when I had none to give but my pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of another man? A prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion entirely hidden in my own heart.</P>
<P>But &s;till I thought I would &s;ooner die, than be the wife of a man of a religion contrary to my own. I am a zealous Catholic my&s;elf: All my relations are zealous Catholics. How angry have I been at this ob&s;tinate Heretic, as I have often called him; the fir&s;t heretic, my dear Mrs. Beaumont (for once I did not love <HI>you)</HI> that my &s;oul dete&s;ted not! For he is as te|nacious a Prote&s;tant as ever came out of England. What had he to do in Italy? Why did he not &s;tay at home? Or why, if he mu&s;t come abroad, did he &s;tay &s;o long among us; yet hold his ob&s;tinacy, as if in de|fiance of the people he was &s;o well received by?</P>
<P>The&s;e were the reproaches that my heart in &s;ilence often ca&s;t upon him.</P>
<P>I was at fir&s;t concerned only for his <HI>&s;oul</HI>'s &s;ake:
<PB N="249" REF="252">
But afterwards, finding him e&s;&s;ential to my earthly happine&s;s, and yet re&s;olving never to think of him if he became not a Catholic, I was earne&s;t for his con|ver&s;ion for my <HI>own</HI> &s;ake; hoping that my friends in|dulgence to me would make my wi&s;hes practicable; for on his part, I doubted not, if that point were got over, he would think an alliance with our family an honour to him.</P>
<P>But when I found him invincible on this article, I was re&s;olved either to conquer my pa&s;&s;ion, or die. What did I not undergo in my endeavours to gain this victory over my&s;elf! My confe&s;&s;or hurt me, by ter|rors; my woman teazed me; my parents, and two elder brothers, and all my more di&s;tant relations, urged me to determine in favour of the Count of Bel|vedere. The Count was importunate: The Cheva|lier was importunate in the Count's behalf&mdash;Good heaven! What could I do?&mdash;I was hurried, as I may &s;ay: I had not time given me to weigh, ponder, re|collect. How could I make my mother, how could I make <HI>any-body</HI> my confident? My judgment was at war with my pa&s;&s;ion; and I hoped it would overcome. I &s;truggled; yet every day the object appearing more worthy, the &s;truggle was too hard for me. O that I had had a Mrs. Beaumont to con&s;ult&mdash;Well might melancholy &s;eize me&mdash;Silent melancholy!</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Chevalier was re&s;olved to leave us. What pain, yet what plea&s;ure, did this his re&s;olution give me! Mo&s;t &s;incerely I hoped, that his ab&s;ence would re&s;tore my tranquillity.</P>
<P>What a &s;ecret triumph did I gave my&s;elf, on my behaviour to him, before all my friends, on the part|ing evening!&mdash;My whole deportment was uniform. I was chearful, &s;erene, happy in my&s;elf, and I made all my friends &s;o. I wi&s;hed him happy where-ever he &s;et his foot, and what&s;oever he engaged in. I thanked him, with the re&s;t of my friends, for the benefits we had received from him&punc; and the plea&s;ure he had given
<PB N="250" REF="253">
us, in the time he had be&s;towed upon us; and I wi&s;hed that he might never want a friend &s;o agree-and entertaining as he had been to us all.</P>
<P>I was the more plea&s;ed with my&s;elf, as I was not under a nece&s;&s;ity of putting on &s;tiffne&s;s or re&s;erve to hide a heart too much affected. I thought my&s;elf &s;ecure, and &s;tood out forwarder than he &s;eemed to hope for, and with <HI>more</HI> than my offered hand, at the moment of his departure. I thought I read in his eyes a concern, for the fir&s;t time, that called for a pity which I imagined I my&s;elf wanted not. Yet I had a pang at parting&mdash;When the door &s;hut out the agreeable man, never again, thought I, to be opened to give him entrance! I &s;ighed at the reflexion: But who perceived it?&mdash;I never could be in&s;en&s;ible in a parting &s;cene, with <HI>le&s;s</HI> agreeable friends: It was the ea&s;ier for me to attribute to the gentlene&s;s of my heart, the in&s;tant &s;en&s;ibility. My father cla&s;ped me to his bo&s;om: My mother embraced me, without morti|fying me by &s;aying for what. My brother, the bi&s;hop, called me twenty fond names; all my friends compli|mented me, but only on my chearfulne&s;s, and &s;aid, I was once more their own Clementina. I went to re&s;t, plea&s;ed that I had &s;o happily acquitted my&s;elf, and that po&s;&s;ibly I contributed to the repo&s;e of dear friends, who&s;e repo&s;e I had been the cau&s;e of di&s;|turbing.</P>
<P>But, alas! this conduct was too great for the poor Clementina to maintain: My &s;oul was too high &s;et.&mdash;You know the re&s;t; and I am lo&s;t to the joys of this life: For I never, never, will be the wife of a man, if I <HI>might,</HI> who by his religion is an enemy to the faith I never wavered in; nor would ever change, were an earthly crown on the head of the man I love to be the reward; and a painful death, in the prime of my life, the contrary.</P>
<P>A flood of tears prevented farther &s;peech. She hid her face in my bo&s;om. She &s;ighed&mdash;Dear Lady! How &s;he &s;ighed!</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="254">
This, madam, is the account I have to give of what has pa&s;&s;ed between your beloved Clementina and me. Never was there a more noble &s;truggle be|tween duty and affection; tho' her heart was too tender, and, in &s;hort, the man's merits too dazling, to allow it to be effectual. She is unwilling that I &s;hould &s;end you the particulars: She &s;hall be a&s;hamed, &s;he &s;ays, to look her father, her mother, in the face; and &s;he dreads &s;till more, if po&s;&s;ible, her confe&s;&s;or's being made acquainted with the &s;tate of her heart, and the cau&s;e of her di&s;order. But I tell her, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her mother to know every|thing that I know, in order to attempt a cure.</P>
<P>This cure, madam, I am afraid will never be ef|fected, but by giving her in marriage to the happy man. I mu&s;t think <HI>him</HI> &s;o, who will be intitled, by general con&s;ent, to &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>You, madam, will act in this affair as you judge proper: But if you can at Bologna, at Urbino, and Naples, get over your family objections, you will perhaps find your&s;elves obliged, &s;uch are the young Lady's <HI>own</HI> &s;cruples, on the &s;core of religion, to take <HI>pains</HI> to per&s;uade her to pur&s;ue her inclination, and accept Mr. Grandi&s;on for an hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, I would humbly recommend a gentle and &s;oothing treatment of her. She never knew yet what the contrary was; and were &s;he to experience <HI>that</HI> contrary now upon an occa&s;ion &s;o very delicate, and in which her Judgment and her Love are, as &s;he hints, at variance; I verily think, &s;he would not be able to bear it&mdash;That God direct you for the be&s;t, whom you and yours have always &s;erved with &s;ignal devotion!</P>
<P>I will only add, That &s;ince the &s;ecret which had &s;o long preyed upon her fine &s;pirits, is revealed, &s;he appears to be much more ea&s;y than before; but yet &s;he dreads the reception &s;he &s;hall meet with on her return to Bologna. She begs of me, when that return
<PB N="252" REF="255">
&s;hall be ordered, to accompany her, in order to enable her, as &s;he &s;ays, to &s;upport her &s;pirits. She is very de&s;irous to enter into a nunnery. She &s;ays, She never can be the wife of any other man; and &s;he thinks &s;he ought not to be his, on whom her heart is fixed.</P>
<P>A word of comfort on paper, from your honoured hand, I know, madam, would do a great deal to|wards healing her wounded heart.</P>

<P>I Inclo&s;e, my Lucy, the doctor's <HI>third</HI> pacquet. From its contents you will pity Sir Charles, as well as Clementina; and if you enter impartially into the &s;ituation of the family, and allow as much to their zeal for a religion they are &s;atisfied with, as you will do for Sir Charles's &s;teadine&s;s in his; you will al&s;o pity <HI>them.</HI> They are all good; they are all con&s;iderate. A great deal is to be &s;aid for them; tho' much more
<PB N="253" REF="256">
for Sir Charles, who in&s;i&s;ted not upon that change of religion in the Lady, which they demanded from him.</P>
<P>How great does he appear in my eyes! A confe&s;|&s;or, tho' not a martyr, one may call him, for his re|ligion and country&mdash;How deep was his di&s;tre&s;s! A mind &s;o delicate as his, and wi&s;hing for the &s;ake of the Sex, and the Lady and Family, as he did, rather to be repul&s;ed by them, than to be obliged him&s;elf to decline their intended favour.</P>
<P>You will admire the Lady in her &s;weetly-mode&s;t behaviour, on his fir&s;t vi&s;it before her mother; but more, for the noble &s;pirit &s;he endeavoured to re&s;ume in her conver&s;ation with him in the garden.</P>
<P>But how great will he appear in your eyes, in the eyes of my grandmother, and aunt Selby, for that noble apo&s;trophe!&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'But, O my Religion and my Country! I cannot, cannot, renounce you! What can this &s;hort life promi&s;e, what can it give, to war|rant &s;uch a &s;acrifice!'</Q></P>
<P>Yet <HI>her</HI> conduct, you will find, is not inferior to <HI>his;</HI> firmly per&s;uaded, as &s;he is, of the truth of her religion; and loving him with an ardor that he had from the fir&s;t re&s;trained in him&s;elf from hopele&s;&s;ne&s;s?</P>
<P>But to admire her as &s;he de&s;erves, I &s;hould tran|&s;cribe all &s;he &s;ays, and his account of her whole be|haviour.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s third Letter.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR &s;ixth command, madam, is,
<Q><P>To give you the particulars of Mr. Grandi&s;on's reception from the Marchione&s;s and her Clemen|tina, on his return to Bologna from Vienna, at the invitation of Signor Jeronymo.</P></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on was received at his arrival with
<PB N="254" REF="257">
great tokens of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip, by the Mar|quis him&s;elf, and by the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>Signor Jeronymo, who &s;till kept his chamber, the introducer being withdrawn, embraced him: And now, &s;aid he, is the affair, that I have had &s;o long in view, determined upon. O Chevalier! you will be a happy man. Clementina will be yours: You will be Clementina's: And now indeed do I embrace my brother&mdash;But I detain you not: Go to the happy girl: She is with her mother, and both are ready to receive and welcome you. Allow for the gentle &s;pi|rit: She will not be able to &s;ay half &s;he thinks.</P>
<P>Camilla then appeared, to conduct me, &s;ays Mr. Grandi&s;on, to her Ladies, in the Marchione&s;s's draw|ing-room. She whi&s;pered me in the pa&s;&s;age: Wel|come, thrice welcome, be&s;t of men! Now will you be rewarded for all your goodne&s;s!</P>
<P>I found the Marchione&s;s &s;itting at her toilette, richly dre&s;&s;ed, as in ceremony; but without attend|ants; even Camilla retired, as &s;oon as &s;he had open|ed the door for me.</P>
<P>The lovely Clementina &s;tood at the back of her mother's chair. She was elegantly dre&s;&s;ed: But her natural mode&s;ty, heightened by a glowing con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s, that &s;eemed to ari&s;e from the occa&s;ion, gave her advantages that her riche&s;t jewels could not have given her.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s &s;tood up. I ki&s;&s;ed her hand&mdash;You are welcome, Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he. The only man on earth that I could <HI>thus</HI> welcome, or is fit to be <HI>&s;o</HI> welcomed!&mdash;Clementina, my dear!&mdash;turning round, and taking her hand.</P>
<P>The young Lady had &s;hrunk back, her complexion varying; now glowing, now pale&mdash;Excu&s;e her <HI>voice,</HI> &s;aid the conde&s;cending mother; her <HI>heart</HI> bids you welcome.</P>
<P>Judge for me, my dear Dr. Bartlett, how I mu&s;t be affected at this gracious reception: I, who knew
<PB N="255" REF="258">
not the terms that were to be pre&s;cribed to me. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Spare me, dear Lady, thought I, &s;pare me my Con|&s;cience, and take all the world's wealth and glory to your&s;elves: I &s;hall be rich enough with Clementina.'</Q></P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s &s;eated her in her own chair. I approached her: But how <HI>could</HI> I with that grateful ardor, that, but for my doubts, would have &s;prung to my lips? Mode&s;t Love, however, was attributed to me; and I had the prai&s;e wholly for that which was but partly due to it.</P>
<P>I drew a chair for the Marchione&s;s, and, at her command, another for my&s;elf. The mother took one hand of her ba&s;hful daughter: I pre&s;umed to take the other: The amiable Lady held down her blu&s;hing face, and reproved me not, as &s;he did once before, on the like freedom, for being <HI>too</HI> free. Her mother a&s;ked me que&s;tions of an indifferent nature; as of my journey; of the courts I had vi&s;ited &s;ince I left them; when I heard from England; after my father; my &s;i&s;ters: The latter que&s;tions in a kind way, as if &s;he were a&s;king after relations that were to be her own.</P>
<P>What a mixture of pain had I with the favour &s;hewn me, and <HI>for</HI> the favour &s;hewn me! For I que|&s;tioned not but a change of religion would be pro|po&s;ed, and in&s;i&s;ted on; and I had no doubt in my mind about my own.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort conver&s;ation the amiable daughter aro&s;e, courte&s;ied low to her mother, with dignity to me; and withdrew.</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier! &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, as &s;oon as &s;he was gone, little did I think, when you le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t us, that we &s;hould &s;o &s;oon &s;ee you again; and on the account we &s;ee you: But you know how to receive your good fortune with gratitude. Your mode&s;ty keeps in coun|tenance our forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>I bowed&mdash;What could I &s;ay?</P>
<P>I &s;hall leave, &s;o will my Lord, particular &s;ubjects to be talked of, between the Bi&s;hop and you. You
<PB N="256" REF="259">
will, if it be not your own fault, have a trea&s;ure in Clementina; and a trea&s;ure with her. We &s;hall do the &s;ame things for her, as if &s;he had married the man we wi&s;hed her to have when we thought her affections di&s;engaged. You may believe we love our daughter&mdash;El&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>I applauded their indulgent goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>I can have no doubt, Mr. Grandi&s;on, that you love Clementina above all women.</P>
<P>[I had never &s;een the woman, Dr. Bartlett, that I <HI>could</HI> have loved &s;o well, had I not re&s;trained my&s;elf, at fir&s;t, from the high notion I knew they had of their quality and rank; from con&s;iderations of the difference in religion; of the tru&s;t and confidence the family placed in me; and by the re&s;olution I had made, as a guard to my&s;elf from the time of my en|tering upon my travels, of never aiming to marry a foreigner.]</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured the Marchione&s;s, that I was ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged in my affections: That not having pre|&s;umed to encourage hopes of the good fortune that &s;eemed to await me, I could hardly <HI>yet</HI> flatter my&s;elf that &s;o great an happine&s;s was re&s;erved for me.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered, That I de&s;erved it all: That I knew the value they had for me: That Clementina's re|gard was founded in virtue: That my character was my happine&s;s: That, however, what the <HI>world</HI> would &s;ay, had been no &s;mall point with them; but that was as good as got over; and &s;he doubted not but all that depended upon me, would, as well from genero|&s;ity as gratitude, be complied with.</P>
<P>[Here, thought I, is couched the expectation: And if &s;o, would to heaven I had never &s;een Italy!]</P>
<P>The Marquis joined his Lady and me &s;oon after. His features had a melancholy ca&s;t. This dear girl, &s;aid he, has fa&s;tened upon me part of her malady. Parents, Chevalier, who are ble&s;&s;ed with even <HI>hopeful</HI> children, are not always happy. This girl&mdash;But no
<PB N="257" REF="260">
more: She is a good child. In the general oeconomy of Providence, none of the &s;ons of men are unhappy, but &s;ome others are the happier for it. Our &s;on the Bi&s;hop will talk to you upon terms.</P>
<P>I have hinted to the Chevalier, my Lord, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, the happine&s;s that waits him.</P>
<P>How <HI>does</HI> the poor girl?&mdash;Ba&s;hful enough, I suppo&s;e!</P>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, &s;he cannot look up, an&s;wered the Lady.</P>
<P>Poor thing! I &s;uppo&s;ed it would be &s;o.</P>
<P>Why, why, thought I, was I &s;uffered to &s;ee this mother, this daughter, before their conditions were propo&s;ed to me!</P>
<P>But what indulgent parents are the&s;e, Dr. Bart|lett? What an excellent daughter? Yet not to be happy! But how much more unhappily circum&s;tan|ced did I think my&s;elf!&mdash;I, who had rather have been rejected with di&s;dain by twenty women in turn, than to be obliged to decline the honour intended me by a family I reverenced!</P>
<P>Thus far Mr. Grandi&s;on. This, madam, will an&s;wer your que&s;tion, as to the VIth article; but I believe a few more particulars will be acceptable.</P>
<P>The Marquis led me, proceeds Mr. Grandi&s;on, into the chamber of Signor Jeronymo. Your good fortune, Chevalier, &s;aid he, as we entered it, is owing to Jeronymo, who owes his life to you. I ble&s;s God, we are a family that know not what ingratitude means.</P>
<P>I made my acknowlegements both to father and &s;on.</P>
<P>The Marquis then went into public affairs; and &s;oon after left us together.</P>
<P>I was con&s;idering, whether I had be&s;t tell that &s;in|cere friend my apprehen&s;ions in relation to the articles of religion and re&s;idence; for he had with an air of humour congratulated me on the philo&s;ophical man|ner
<PB N="258" REF="261">
in which I bore my good fortune; when Camil|la entered, and whi&s;pered me, of her own head, as &s;he &s;aid, That her young Lady was ju&s;t gone into the garden.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, it <HI>was</HI> of her own head: For Camilla has a great deal of good-nature, and is con&s;tantly de|&s;irous of obliging, where &s;he thinks &s;he &s;hall not of|fend any-body.</P>
<P>Follow her then, &s;aid Jeronymo, who heard what Camilla &s;aid: Clementina perhaps expects you.</P>
<P>Camilla waited for me at the entrance into the gar|den. One word, Sir, if you plea&s;e. I am afraid of the return of my young Lady's thoughtfulne&s;s. She &s;ays, &s;he is a&s;hamed of the poor figure &s;he made be|fore her mother: She is &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t look mean in your eyes. A man to be &s;ent for, Camilla, &s;aid &s;he, in compliment to my weakne&s;s! Why did not my too indulgent father bid me conquer my folly, or die? O that I had not owned my attachment! <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Naughty Mrs. Beaumont! &s;aid &s;he, Had it not been for you, my own bo&s;om had contained the &s;ecret; till &s;hame, and indignation again&s;t my&s;elf, had bur&s;t my heart!'</Q> She is re&s;olved, &s;he &s;ays, to re&s;ume a &s;pirit becom|ing her birth and quality; and I am afraid of her ele|vations. Her great apprehen&s;ions are, that, with all this conde&s;cen&s;ion of her parents, ob&s;tacles will ari&s;e on <HI>your</HI> part. If &s;o, &s;he &s;ays &s;he &s;hall not be able to beat her own reflexions, nor look her friends in the face.</P>
<P>My dear Dr. Bartlett, how have I, who have hi|therto &s;o happily e&s;caped the &s;nares by which the feet of unreflectiong youth are often entangled by women of light &s;ame, been embarra&s;&s;ed by perver&s;e accidents that have ari&s;en from my friend&s;hips with the <HI>worthy</HI> of the Sex! Was there ever a more excellent family than this?&mdash;Every individual of it is excellent. And is not then worthine&s;s, and even their piety, the cau&s;e to which our mutual difficulties are owing?</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="262">
But, O my Religion and my Country! I cannot, canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> renounce you! What can this &s;hort life give, what can it promi&s;e, to warrant &s;uch a &s;acrifice!</P>
<P>I &s;aid nothing to Camilla, you may believe, of what I <HI>could</HI> or could <HI>not</HI> do; yet &s;he &s;aw my di&s;tre&s;s: She took notice of it Being firmly per&s;uaded of the ex|cellency of her own religion, &s;he wondered that a man of reflexion and reading could be of a contrary one. Her heart, &s;he &s;aid, as well as the heart of her young Lady, boded an unhappy i&s;&s;ue to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Loves: Heaven avert it! &s;aid the hone&s;t woman: But what m y we not fear by way of judgment, where a young Lady&mdash;Forgive me, Sir&mdash;pre&s;ers a man &s;he thinks &s;he ought <HI>not</HI> to prefer; and where a gentleman will not be convinced of errors which the Church con|demns?</P>
<P>She again begged I would forgive her. I prai&s;ed her good intention, and &s;incere dealing; and leaving her&punc; went into the garden.</P>
<P>I &s;ound the young Lady in the Orange-grove. You have been in that ga den, Dr. Bartlett.</P>
<P>She turned her face towards me, as I drew near her, and &s;eeing who it was, &s;topt.</P>
<P>Clementina, armed with con&s;cious worthine&s;s, as if &s;he had re&s;umed the &s;ame &s;pirit which had animated her on the eve of my departure from Bologna, con|de&s;cended to advance two or three paces towards me.</P>
<P>Lovely woman, thought I, encourage the true dignity that &s;hines in that noble a&s;pect!&mdash;Who knows what may be our de&s;tiny?</P>
<P>I bowed. Veneration, e&s;teem, and concern, from the thought of what <HI>that</HI> might be, all joined to make my obei&s;ance profound.</P>
<P>I was going to &s;peak. She prevented me. Her air and manner were great.</P>
<P>You are welcome, Sir, &s;aid&punc; &s;he. My mamma bid me &s;ay welcome. I could not <HI>then</HI> &s;peak: And &s;he
<PB N="260" REF="263">
was &s;o good to <HI>you,</HI> as to an&s;wer for my heart. My <HI>voice</HI> is now found: But tell me&mdash;Do I &s;ee the &s;ame generous, the &s;ame noble Grandi&s;on, that I have heretofore &s;een?&mdash;Or, do I &s;ee a man inclined to &s;light the creature whom her indulgent parents are deter|mined to oblige, even to the &s;acrifice of all their views?</P>
<P>You &s;ee, madam, the &s;ame Grandi&s;on, his heart only oppre&s;&s;ed with the honour done him; and with the fear that the happine&s;s de&s;igned for him may yet be fru&s;trated. If it &s;hould, how &s;hall I be able to &s;upport my&s;elf?</P>
<P>[What a difficult &s;ituation, my dear Dr. Bartlett, was mine!&mdash;Equally afraid to urge my &s;uit with ar|dor, or to be imagined capable of being indifferent to her favour!]</P>
<P>What do you fear, Sir?&mdash;You have grounds in your own heart, perhaps, for your fear. If you <HI>have,</HI> let me know them. I am not <HI>afraid</HI> to know them. Let me tell you, that I oppo&s;ed the &s;tep taken. I do|clared, that I would &s;ooner die, than it <HI>&s;hould</HI> be taken. It was to YOU, they &s;aid; and you would know how to receive as you ought the di&s;tinction paid you. I have a &s;oul, Sir, not unworthy of the &s;pirit of my ance&s;tors: Tell me what you fear?&mdash;I only fear one thing; and that is, that I &s;hould be thought to be more in your power than in my own.</P>
<P>Noble Lady! And think you, that while my hap|pine&s;s is not yet ab&s;olutely re&s;olved upon, I have not <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to fear?&mdash;You will always, madam, be in your own power: You will be mo&s;t &s;o when in mine. My gratitude will ever prompt me to acknowlege your goodne&s;s to me as a conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>But &s;ay; tell me, Sir; Did you not, at fir&s;t receiv|ing the invitation, de&s;pi&s;e, in ab&s;ence, the Clemen|tina, that now perhaps, in pre&s;ence, you have the <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> to <HI>pity?</HI></P>
<P>O that the high-&s;oul'd Clementina would not think
<PB N="261" REF="264">
&s;o contemptibly of the man before her, as &s;he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> think, when &s;he puts a que&s;tion that would intitle him to infamy, could he pre&s;ume to think an <HI>an&s;wer</HI> to it nece&s;&s;ary!</P>
<P>Well, Sir; I &s;hall &s;ee how far the advances made an the <HI>wrong</HI> &s;ide will be ju&s;tified, or rather counte|nanced, by the advances, or, &s;hall I &s;ay (I will if you plea&s;e) <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ions</HI> to be made on <HI>yours.</HI></P>
<P>[What a petulance, thought I! But can the gene|rous, the noble Clementina, <HI>knowing</HI> that terms will be propo&s;ed, with which in honour and con&s;cience I cannot comply, put my regard for her on &s;uch a te&s;t as this?&mdash;I will not &s;uppo&s;e that &s;he is capable of mingling art with her magnanimity.]</P>
<P>Is this, madam, &s;aid I, a generous anticipation? Forgive me: But when your friends are &s;o good as to think me incapable of returning ingratitude for obli|gation, I hope I &s;hall not be cla&s;&s;ed, by their beloved daughter, among the lowe&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e me, Sir; the woman who has been once wrong, has rea&s;on to be always afraid of her&s;elf. if <HI>you</HI> do not think meanly of me, I will endeavour to think well of <HI>my&s;elf;</HI> and then, Sir, I &s;hall think better of <HI>you,</HI> if better I <HI>can</HI> think: For, after all, did I not more mi&s;tru&s;t <HI>my&s;elf</HI> than I do <HI>you,</HI> I &s;hould not perhaps be &s;o capricious as, I am afraid, I &s;ome|times am.</P>
<P>The Marquis has hinted to me, madam, That your brother the Bi&s;hop is to di&s;cour&s;e with me on the &s;ubject now the neare&s;t to my heart of all others: May I pre&s;ume to addre&s;s my&s;elf to their beloved daughter upon it, without being thought capable of endeavouring to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s her in my favour before my Lord and I meet?</P>
<P>I will an&s;wer you frankly, Sir: There are preli|minaries to be &s;ettled; and, till they are, I that <HI>know</HI> there are, do not think my&s;elf at liberty to hear you upon <HI>any</HI> &s;ubject that may tend to prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="265">
I acquie&s;ce, madam: I would not for the world be thought to wi&s;h for the honour of your attention, while it is improper for you to favour me with it.</P>
<P>[I did not know, Dr. Bartlett, but upon a &s;uppo|&s;ition of a mutual intere&s;t between us, as I had hoped &s;he would allow, Clementina might <HI>wi&s;h</HI> that I would lead to &s;ome particular di&s;cour&s;e. Tho' mode&s;ty be|comes ours as well as the other &s;ex, yet it would be an indelicacy not to prevent a Lady, in &s;ome certain ca&s;es. But thus di&s;couraged,] Perhaps, madam, &s;aid I, the attendance I do my&s;elf the honour to pay you here, may not be agreeable to the Marquis.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, you will choo&s;e, perhaps, to withdraw. But don't&mdash;Yes, do.</P>
<P>I re&s;pectfully withdrew; but &s;he taking a winding alley, which led into that in which I &s;lowly walked, we met again. I am afraid, &s;aid &s;he, I have been a little petulant: Indeed, Sir, I am not &s;atisfied with my&s;elf. I <HI>wi&s;h</HI> &mdash;And there &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>What, madam, do you wi&s;h? Favour me with your wi&s;hes. If it be in my power&mdash;</P>
<P>It is <HI>not,</HI> interrupted &s;he. I wi&s;h I had not been at Florence. The Lady I was with, is a good woman; but &s;he was too hard for me. Perhaps (and &s;he &s;ighed) had I not been with <HI>her,</HI> I had been at re&s;t, and happy, before now; but if I had <HI>not,</HI> there is a plea|&s;ure, as well as pain, in melancholy. But now I am <HI>&s;o</HI> fretful!&mdash;If I hated the bittere&s;t enemy I have, as <HI>much</HI> as at times I hate my&s;elf, I &s;hould be a very bad creature.</P>
<P>This was &s;poken with an air &s;o melancholy, as greatly di&s;turbed me. God grant, thought I, that the articles of Religion and re&s;idence may be agreed upon between the Bi&s;hop and me!</P>
<P>Here, my good Mi&s;s Byron, I clo&s;e this Letter. Sir Charles has told you, briefly, the event of the con|ference between the Bi&s;hop and him; and I ha&s;ten to obey you in your next article.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day Morn. Mar. <HI>30.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Send you now inclo&s;ed the doctor's fourth Letter. I believe I mu&s;t de&s;ire my grandmamma and my aunt Selby to &s;end for me down.</P>
<P>We &s;hall all be in London this evening.</P>
<P>Would to heaven I had never come to it!&mdash;What of plea&s;ure have I had in it?&mdash;This abominable Sir Hargrave Pollexfen!&mdash;But for <HI>him,</HI> I had been ea&s;y and happy; &s;ince but for <HI>him,</HI> I had never wanted the re|lief of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; never had known him. Fame might perhaps have brought to my ears, in general conver&s;ation, as other per&s;ons of di&s;tinction are talked of, &s;ome of his benevolent actions; and he would have attracted my admiration without co&s;ting me one &s;igh. And yet, had it been &s;o, I &s;hould then have known none of tho&s;e lively &s;en&s;ibilities that have mingled plea&s;ure with my pain, on the pride I have had in being di&s;tingui&s;hed as a &s;i&s;ter to the &s;i&s;ters of &s;o extraordinary a man. O that I had kept my fooli&s;h heart free! I &s;hould then have had enough to boa&s;t of for my whole life, enough to talk of to every one. And when I had been a&s;ked by my companions and intimates, What diver&s;ions, what entertainments, I had been at? I &s;hould have &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I have been in company and conver&s;ed with SIR CHARLES GRAN|DISON; and been favoured and di&s;tingui&s;hed by all his family.'</Q> And I &s;hould have pa&s;&s;ed many a happy winter evening, when my companions came to work and read with me at Selby-hou&s;e, in an&s;wering their que&s;tions about all the&s;e; and Sir Charles would have been known among us principally by the name of <HI>The fine Gentleman;</HI> and my young friends would have come about me, and a&s;ked me to tell them &s;ome|thing more of <HI>The Excellent man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="267">
But now my ambition has overthrown me: Aiming, wi&s;hing to be every-thing, I am nothing. If I am a&s;ked about him, or his &s;i&s;ters, I &s;hall &s;eek to evade the &s;ubject; and yet, what other &s;ubject can I talk of? For what have I &s;een; what have I known, &s;ince I left Northampton&s;hire, but Him and Them; and what mu&s;t lead to Him and Them? And what indeed but Him and Them, &s;ince I have known this family, have I wi&s;hed to &s;ee, and to know?</P>
<P>On reviewing the above, how have I, as I &s;ee, &s;uf|fered my childi&s;h fancies to delude me into a &s;hort for|getfulne&s;s of <HI>his,</HI> of <HI>every</HI> -body's di&s;tre&s;&s;es!&mdash;But, O my Lucy, my heart is torn in pieces; and, I verily think, more for the unhappy Clementina's &s;ake, than for my own! How &s;everely do I pay for my curio&s;ity! Yet it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould know the wor&s;t. So Sir Charles &s;eems to have thought, by the permi&s;&s;ion he has given to Dr. Bartlett, to oblige me, and through me, his &s;i&s;ters, and all you my own friends.</P>
<P>Your pity will be more rai&s;ed on reading the Letter I inclo&s;e, not only for Clementina and Sir Charles, but for the whole family; none of whom, tho' all unhappy, are to be blamed. You will dearly love the noble Jeronymo, and be plea&s;ed with the young Lady's faithful Camilla: But, my dear, there is &s;o much tenderne&s;s in Sir Charles's woe&mdash;It mu&s;t be Love&mdash;But he <HI>ought</HI> to love Clementina: She is a glorious, tho'unhappy, young creature. I mu&s;t not have one &s;park of genero&s;ity left in my heart, I mu&s;t be lo&s;t wholly in <HI>Self,</HI> if I did not equally admire and love her.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s fourth Letter.</HEAD>
<P>AS I remember, madam, Sir Charles mentions to you, in a very pathetic manner, the di&s;tre&s;s he was in when the terms and conditions, on which he was to be allowed to call the noble Clementina his,
<PB N="265" REF="268">
were propo&s;ed to him; as they were by the Bi&s;hop. He has briefly told you the terms, and his grief to be obliged to di&s;appoint the expectation of per&s;ons &s;o de|&s;ervedly dear to him. But you will not, I believe, be di&s;plea&s;ed, if I dwell a little more on the&s;e particulars, tho' they are not commanded from me.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop, when he had acquainted Mr. Gran|di&s;on with the terms, &s;aid, You are &s;ilent, my dear Grandi&s;on: You he&s;itate. What, Sir! Is a propo&s;al of a daughter of one of the noble&s;t families in I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aly; that daughter a <HI>Clementina;</HI> to be &s;lighted by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">an of a private family; a foreigner; of dependent for|tunes; her dowry not unworthy of a Prince's accep|tance? Do you he&s;itate upon &s;uch a propo&s;al as this, Sir?</P>
<P>My Lord, I am grieved, rather than &s;urpri&s;ed, at the propo&s;al: I was apprehen&s;ive it would be made. My joy at receiving the conde&s;cending invitation, and at the honours done me, on my arrival, otherwi&s;e would have been immoderate.</P>
<P>A debate then followed, upon &s;ome articles in which the Church of Rome and the Prote&s;tant Churches differ. Mr. Grandi&s;on would fain have avoided it; but the Bi&s;hop, &s;uppo&s;ing he &s;hould have &s;ome advantages in the argument, which he met not with, would not permit him. He was very warm with Mr. Grandi&s;on more than once, which did not help his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The particulars of this debate I will not at this time give you: They would carry me into great length; and I have much to tran&s;cribe, that I believe, from what Sir Charles has let me &s;ee of your manner of writing to your friends, you would prefer. To that I will proceed; after a pa&s;&s;age or two, which will &s;hew you how that debate, about the difference in Religion, went off.</P>
<P>You will call to mind, Chevalier, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop,
<PB N="266" REF="269">
that your church allows of a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation out of its pale&mdash;Ours does not.</P>
<P>My Lord, our church allows not of its members indulging them&s;elves in capital errors, again&s;t con|viction: But I hope that no more need to be &s;aid on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I think, replied the Bi&s;hop, we will quit it. I did not expect that you were &s;o firmly rooted in error, as I find you: But to the point on which we began: I &s;hould think it an extraordinary misfortune, were we to find our&s;elves reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of rea&s;oning a private man into the acceptance of our &s;i&s;ter Cle|mentina. Let me tell you, Sir, that were &s;he to know that you <HI>but he&s;itate</HI> &mdash;He &s;poke with earne&s;tne&s;s, and reddened.</P>
<P>Pardon an interruption, my Lord: You are di&s;po&s;ed to be warm. I will not &s;o much as <HI>offer</HI> to defend my|&s;elf from any imputations that may, in di&s;plea&s;ure, be ca&s;t upon me, as if I were capable of &s;lighting the ho|nour intended me of a Lady who is worthy of a Prince. I am per&s;uaded that your Lord&s;hip cannot think &s;uch a de&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary. I am indeed a private man, but not incon&s;iderable; if the being able to enu|merate a long race of ance&s;tors, whom hitherto I have not di&s;graced, will give me con&s;ideration. But what, my Lord, is ance&s;try? I live to my own heart. My principles were known before I had the con|de&s;cending invitation. Your Lord&s;hip would not per|&s;uade me to change them, when I cannot think them wrong; and &s;ince, as you have heard, I have &s;ome|thing to offer, when called upon, in &s;upport of them.</P>
<P>You will con&s;ider this matter, my dear Chevalier. It is you, I think, that are di&s;po&s;ed to be warm; but you are a valuable man. We, as well as our &s;i&s;ter, wi&s;h to have you among us: Our church would wi&s;h it. Such a pro&s;elyte will ju&s;tify us to every other con&s;ideration, and to all our friends. Con&s;ider of it, Grandi&s;on; but let it not be known to the principals
<PB N="267" REF="270">
of our family, that you think con&s;ideration nece&s;&s;ary: The dear Clementina, particularly, mu&s;t not know it. Your <HI>per&s;on,</HI> Chevalier, is not &s;o dear to the excellent creature, as your <HI>&s;oul.</HI> Hence it is, that we are all willing to encourage in her a flame &s;o pure, and &s;o bright.</P>
<P>My di&s;tre&s;s, my Lord, is beyond the power of words to de&s;cribe. I revere, I honour, and will to my la&s;t, hour, the Marquis and Marchione&s;s of Porretta, and on better motives than for their grandeur or no|bility. Their &s;ons&mdash;You know not, my Lord, the pride I have always had to be di&s;tingui&s;hed even by a nominal relation to <HI>them:</HI> And give me your Cle|mentina, without the hard conditions you pre&s;cribe, and I &s;hall be happy beyond my highe&s;t wi&s;h. I de|&s;ire not dowry with her. I have a father on who&s;e genero&s;ity and affection I can rely. But I mu&s;t re|peat, my Lord, that my principles are &s;o well known, that I hoped a compromi&s;e would be accepted&mdash;I would not for the world compel your &s;i&s;ter. The &s;ame liberty that I crave, I would allow.</P>
<P>And will you not take time, Sir, to con&s;ider? Are you ab&s;olutely determined?</P>
<P>If your Lord&s;hip know the pain it gives me to &s;ay that <HI>I am,</HI> you would pity me.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, I am &s;orry for it. Let us go in to Signor Jeronymo. He has been your advocate ever &s;ince he knew you. Jeronymo has gratitude; but you, Che|valier, have no affections.</P>
<P>I thank God, &s;aid I, that your Lord&s;hip does not do me ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>He led me into his brother's apartment.</P>
<P>There, what did I not &s;uffer, from the Friend&s;hip, from the Love of that brother&punc; and from the urgency of the Bi&s;hop! But what was the re&s;ult?</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop a&s;ked me, If he were to conduct me to his father, to his mother, to his &s;i&s;ter? Or to allow me to depart without &s;eeing them?&mdash;This was the al|ternative. My compliance or non-compliance was to
<PB N="268" REF="271">
be thus indicated. I re&s;pectfully bowed. I recom|mended my&s;elf to the favour of the two brothers, and thro' them to that of the three truly-re&s;pectable per|&s;ons they had named; and withdrew to my lodgings with a heart &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I was unable to &s;tir out for the remainder of the day. The &s;ame chair into which I threw my&s;elf, upon my fir&s;t coming in, held me for hours.</P>
<P>In the evening Camilla, in di&s;gui&s;e, made me a vi&s;it. On my &s;ervant's withdrawing, revealing her&s;elf, O Sir, &s;aid &s;he, what a di&s;tracted family have I left! They know not of my coming hither; but I could not forbear this officiou&s;ne&s;s: I cannot &s;tay. But let me ju&s;t tell you how unhappy we are; and your own genero&s;ity will &s;ugge&s;t to you, what is be&s;t to be done.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as you were gone, my Lord Bi&s;hop ac|quainted my Lady Marchione&s;s with what had pa&s;&s;ed between you. O Sir! you have an affectionate friend in Signor Jeronymo. He endeavoured to &s;often every thing. My Lady Marchione&s;s acquainted my Lord with the Bi&s;hop's report. I never &s;aw that good nobleman in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to tell you what he &s;aid&mdash;</P>
<P>In a pa&s;&s;ion with <HI>me,</HI> Camilla!</P>
<P>Yes. He thought the whole family di&s;honoured, Sir.</P>
<P>The Marquis della Porretta is the worthie&s;t of men, Camilla, &s;aid I. I honour him.&mdash;But proceed.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s, in the tendere&s;t manner, broke the matter to my young Lady: I was pre&s;ent. She apprehended, that there might be occa&s;ion for my at|tendance, and commanded me to &s;tay.</P>
<P>Before &s;he could &s;peak all &s;he had to &s;ay, my young Lady threw her&s;elf on her knees to her mamma, and ble&s;&s;ing her for her goodne&s;s to her, begged her to &s;pare the re&s;t. I &s;ee, &s;aid &s;he, that I, a daughter of the Porretta family, <HI>your</HI> daughter, madam, am refu&s;ed.
<PB N="269" REF="272">
Palliate not, I be&s;eech you, the indignity. You need not. It is enough, that I am refu&s;ed. Surely, madam, your Clementina is not &s;o ba&s;e in &s;pirit, as to need your maternal con&s;olation on &s;uch a contempt as this. I feel for my papa, for you, madam, and for my bro|thers, I feel the indignity. Ble&s;&s;ings follow the man where-ever he goes! It would be mean to be angry with him. He is his own ma&s;ter! and now he has made me my own mi&s;tre&s;s. Never fear, madam, but this affair now will &s;it as light upon me, as it ought. His humility will allow him to be &s;atisfied with a meaner wife. You, madam, my papa, my brothers, &s;hall not find <HI>me</HI> mean.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s embraced, with tears of joy, her beloved daughter. She brought my Lord to her, and reported what her daughter had &s;aid: He al&s;o tenderly embraced the dear young Lady, and rejoyced in her a&s;&s;urances, that now the cure was effected.</P>
<P>But, un&s;ea&s;onably, as the event &s;hewed, Father Mare&s;cotti, being talked with, was earne&s;t to be al|lowed to vi&s;it her: Then, he &s;aid, was the proper time, the very cri&s;is, to urge her to accept of the Count of Belvedere.</P>
<P>I was bid to tell her, that his Reverence de&s;ired to attend her.</P>
<P>O let me go, &s;aid &s;he, to Florence; to my dear Mrs. Beaumont!&mdash;To-morrow morning let me go; and not &s;ee Father Mare&s;cotti, till I can &s;ee him as I wi&s;h to &s;ee him!</P>
<P>But the good Father prevailed: He meant the be&s;t.</P>
<P>He was with her half an hour. He left her in a melancholy way. When her mamma went to her, &s;he &s;ound her &s;piritle&s;s, her eyes fixed, and as gloomy as ever. She was &s;ilent to two or three of her mo|ther's que&s;tions; and when &s;he <HI>did</HI> &s;peak, it was with wildne&s;s; but declaring, without being &s;olicited in the Count of Belvedere's favour, again&s;t marrying him, or any man in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="273">
Her mother told her, &s;he &s;hould go to Florence, as &s;oon as &s;he plea&s;ed: But then the humour was off. Would to Heaven &s;he had gone before &s;he &s;aw his Reverence! So they all now wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;aid &s;he to me, when we were alone, Was it nece&s;&s;ary to load the Chevalier Grandi&s;on? Was it nece&s;&s;ary to inveigh again&s;t him? It was un|generous to do &s;o. Was the man obliged to have the creature who&s;e forwardne&s;s had rendered her con|temptible in his eyes? I could not bear to hear him inveighed again&s;t. But never, never, let me hear his named mentioned. But, Camilla, I cannot bear be|ing de&s;pi&s;ed, neither.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e from her &s;eat, and from that moment her humour took a different turn. She now talks: She raves: She &s;tarts: She neither &s;its nor &s;tands with quietne&s;s&mdash;She walks up and down her room, at other times, with pa&s;&s;ion and hurry; yet weeps not, tho' &s;he makes every-body el&s;e weep. She &s;peaks to her|&s;elf, and an&s;wers her&s;elf; and, as I gue&s;s, repeats part of the talk that pa&s;&s;ed between Father Mare&s;cotti and her: But &s;till, <HI>To be de&s;pi&s;ed!</HI> are the words &s;he oftene&s;t repeats&mdash;<HI>Je&s;u!</HI> once, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;<HI>To be de&s;pi&s;ed!</HI> &mdash;And by an Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant! Who can bear that?</P>
<P>In this way, Sir, is Lady Clementina. The &s;weet|e&s;t creature! I &s;ee, I &s;ee, you have compa&s;&s;ion, Sir! You never wanted humanity! Genero&s;ity is a part of your nature! I am &s;ure you love her&mdash;I <HI>&s;ee</HI> you love her&mdash;I pain your noble heart! Indeed, indeed, Sir, Lady Clementina's Love extended beyond the limits of this world: She hoped to be yours to all eternity.</P>
<P>Well might Camilla, the &s;en&s;ible, the faithful, the affectionate Camilla, the attendant from in&s;ant years of her beloved Clementina, thus run on, without in|terruption. I could not &s;peak. And had I been able, to what purpo&s;e &s;hould I have pleaded to Camilla the &s;uperior attachement which occa&s;ioned an angui&s;h that words cannot de&s;cribe?</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="274">
What can I &s;ay, but thank you, my good Camilla, for your intention? I hope you have ea&s;ed your own heart; but you have loaded mine&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, I thank you. Would to Heaven that your Lady's own wi&s;hes had been complied with; that &s;he had been en|couraged to go to the excellent Mrs. Beaumont! The fir&s;t natural impul&s;es of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed heart often point out the be&s;t alleviation. Would to Heaven they had been pur&s;ued! I have great dependence on the gene|rous friend&s;hip of Signor Jeronymo. All that is in my power to do, I will do, I honour, I venerate, every one of the truly-noble family: I never can de&s;erve their favour. On all occa&s;ions, Camilla, let them know my devotion to them.</P>
<P>I beg of God, &s;aid me, to put it into your hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o re&s;tore the tranquillity of a family that was, till lately, the happie&s;t in Bologna. It may not be yet too late. I beg you to excu&s;e my officiou&s;ne&s;s. Pray take no notice that I have waited on you. I &s;hall be wanted.</P>
<P>She was ha&s;tening away. Good Camilia, &s;aid I, taking a ring of &s;ome value from my finger, and forcing it upon hers (&s;he is above accepting of pecu|niary pre&s;ents, and &s;truggled again&s;t this), Accept this as a remembrance, not acknowlegement. I may be forbid the palace of the Marquis della Porretta, and &s;o have no opportunity again to &s;ee the equally faithful and obliging Camilla.</P>
<P>What other conditions could have been pre&s;cribed, Dr. Bartlett, that I &s;hould have refu&s;ed to comply with? How was I anew di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, at the account Camilla gave me! But my great con&s;olation in the whole tran&s;action is that my own heart, on the ma|ture&s;t deliberation, acquits me: And the rather, as it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to practi&s;e a greater piece of &s;elf-denial: For can there be on earth a nobler Lady than Clementina?</P>
<P>The next morning, early, Mr. Grandi&s;on received the following Letter from his friend Signor Jeronymo.

I tran&s;lated it, my good Mi&s;s Byron, at the time I received it. I will &s;end you the tran&s;lation, only.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Chevalier!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SHALL I blame you?&mdash;I cannot. Shall I blame my father, my mother?&mdash;They blame them|&s;elves, for the free acce&s;s you were allowed to have to their Clementina; yet they own, that you acted nobly. But they had forgot that Clementina had eyes. Yet who knew not her di&s;cernment? Who knew not her regard for merit where-ever &s;he found it? Can I therefore blame my &s;i&s;ter?&mdash;Indeed, no. Has &s;he a <HI>brother</HI> whom I can blame?&mdash;No. But ought I not to blame my&s;elf? The dear creature owned, it &s;eems, to Mrs. Beaumont, that my decla|ration in your favour, which was made long before you knew it, was one of her influences. Mu&s;t I therefore accu&s;e my&s;elf?&mdash;If I regard my intention, gratitude, for a life pre&s;erved by you, and for a &s;en&s;e of my <HI>&s;ocial</HI> duties (&s;oul as well as body indebted to you, tho' a Prote&s;tant your&s;elf) will not &s;uffer it. Is there then nobody whom we can blame for the ca|lamity befallen us?&mdash;How &s;trangely is that calamity circum&s;tanced!</P>
<P>But is there &s;o irreconcileable a difference between the two religious?&mdash;There is: The Bi&s;hop &s;ays there is: Clementina thinks there is: My father, my mo|ther, think there is.</P>
<P>But does <HI>your</HI> father think &s;o? Will you put the whole matter on that i&s;&s;ue, Chevalier?</P>
<P>O no, you will not. You are as determined as we are: Yet, &s;urely, with le&s;s rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But I debate not the matter with you. I know you are a ma&s;ter of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But what is to be done? Shall Clementina peri&s;h? Will not the gallant youth, who ventured his life &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully to &s;ave a brother, exert him&s;elf to pre&s;erve a &s;i&s;ter?</P>

<P>It is to reque&s;t you to make me a vi&s;it. Breakfa&s;t with me, my dear Chevalier, this morning. You will perhaps &s;ee nobody el&s;e.</P>
<P>Camilla has told me, and <HI>only</HI> me, that &s;he attended you la&s;t night: She tells me how greatly you are grieved.

<P>The General, I hear, came to town la&s;t night: We have not &s;een him yet. He had bu&s;ine&s;s with the Gonfalionere. I think you mu&s;t not meet. He is warm. He adores Clementina. He knew not, till la&s;t night, that the Bi&s;hop broke it to him at that magi&s;|trate's, our unhappy &s;ituation. What a di&s;appointment!

<P>I accepted of the invitation. My heart was in this family: I longed, before this Letter came, to &s;ee and to hear from it. The face of the meane&s;t &s;ervant be|longing to it would have been <HI>more</HI> than welcome to me. What, however, were my hopes? Yet, do you think, Dr. Bartlett, that I had not pain in going; a pain that took more than its turn, with the de&s;ire I had once more to enter doors that u&s;ed to be opened to me with &s;o much plea&s;ure on both &s;ides?</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s fifth Letter.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Grandi&s;on thus proceeds: I was introduced to Signor Jeronymo. He &s;at expecting me. He bowed more &s;tiffly than u&s;ual, in return to my freer compliment.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid I, that I have lo&s;t my friend.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he. It cannot be.</P>
<P>Then &s;peaking of his &s;i&s;ter, Dear creature! &s;aid he. A very bad night. My poor mother has been up with her ever &s;ince Three o'clock: Nobody el&s;e has any influence with her. The&s;e talking fits are wor&s;e than her &s;ilent ones.</P>
<P>What could I &s;ay? My &s;oul was vexed. My friend &s;aw it, and was grieved for me. He talked of in|different things. I could not follow him in them.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="278">
He then entered upon the &s;ubject that would not long allow of any other. I expect the General, &s;aid he. I will not, I think, have you &s;ee each other. I have ordered notice to be given me before any one of the family is admitted, while you are with me. If you choo&s;e not to &s;ee the General, or my father or mother, &s;hould they &s;tep in to make their morning compliments, you can walk down the back-&s;tairs in|to the garden, or into the next chamber.</P>
<P>I am not the lea&s;t &s;ufferer in this di&s;tre&s;s, replied I. You have invited me. If on your own account you would have me withdraw, I will; but el&s;e I cannot conceal my&s;elf.</P>
<P>This is like you. It is you your&s;elf. O Grandi&s;on! that we could be <HI>real</HI> brothers!&mdash;In &s;oul we are &s;o. But what is the compromi&s;e you hinted at?</P>
<P>I then told him, That I would re&s;ide one year in Italy, another in England, by turns, if the dear Cle|mentina would accompany me; if not, but three months in England, in every year. As to religion, &s;he &s;hould keep her own; her confe&s;&s;or only to be a man of known di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>He &s;hook his head. I'll propo&s;e it as from your&s;elf, if you would have me do &s;o, Chevalier. It would do with me; but will not with any-body el&s;e. I have undertaken for more than that already; but it will not be heard of. Would to God, Chevalier, that you, for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake, for <HI>all</HI> our &s;akes.&mdash;But I know you have a great deal to &s;ay on this &s;ubject, as you told my brother. New converts, added he, may be zeal|ous; but you old Prote&s;tants, Prote&s;tants by de&s;cent, as I may &s;ay, 'tis &s;trange you &s;hould be &s;o very &s;ted|fa&s;t. You have not many young gentlemen, I be|lieve, who would be &s;o very tenacious; &s;uch offers, &s;uch advantages&mdash;And &s;urely you mu&s;t love my &s;i&s;ter! All our family, you &s;urely love. I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, they de&s;erve your love; and they give the &s;trong|e&s;t proofs that can be given of their regard for you.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="279">
Signor Jeronymo expected not an argumentative an&s;wer to what he &s;aid. My &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s was be&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ed; and &s;urely it was &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ed (the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e &s;o intere&s;ting) by &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in Camilla. The Marchione&s;s, Sir, knows you are here. She de&s;ires you will not go till &s;he &s;ees you. She will attend you here, I believe.</P>
<P>She is per&s;uading Lady Clementina to be blooded. She has an aver&s;ion to that operation. She begs it may not be done. She has been hitherto, on that ac|count, bled by leaches. The Marquis and the Bi&s;hop are both gone out. They could not bear her &s;oli|citations to them to <HI>&s;ave</HI> her, as &s;he called it.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s &s;oon after entered Care, melan|choly, yet trenderne&s;s, was in her a&s;pect: Grief for her daughter's malady &s;eemed fixed in the lines of her fine face. Keep your &s;eat, Chevalier. She &s;at down, &s;ighed, wept; but would not have had her tears &s;een.</P>
<P>Had I not been &s;o deeply concerned in the cau&s;e of her grief, I could have endeavoured to comfort her. But what could I &s;ay? I turned my head a&s;ide. I would al&s;o have concealed <HI>my</HI> emotion, but Signor Jeronymo took notice of it.</P>
<P>The poor Chevalier, kindly &s;aid he, with an accent of compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>I don't doubt it, an&s;wered &s;he, as kindly, tho' he &s;poke not out what he had to &s;ay. He may be ob|durate; but not ungrateful.</P>
<P>Excellent woman! How was I affected by her ge|nero&s;ity! This was taking the direct road to my heart. You know that heart, Dr. Bartlett, and what a ta&s;k it had.</P>
<P>Jeronymo enquired after his &s;i&s;ter's health; <HI>I</HI> was afraid to enquire.</P>
<P>Not wor&s;e, I hope; but &s;o talkative! poor thing! She bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>I pre&s;umed to take her hand&mdash;O Madam! Will no compromi&s;e! Will no&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="280">
It ought not, Chevalier. I cannot urge it. We know your power, <HI>too well</HI> we know your power over the dear creature. She will not be long a Catholic, if &s;he be yours; and you know what we then &s;hould think of her precious &s;oul!&mdash;Better to part with her for ever&mdash;Yet, how can a mother&mdash;Her tears &s;poke what her lips could not utter.</P>
<P>Recovering her voice, I have left her, &s;aid &s;he, contending with the doctors again&s;t being let blood. She was &s;o earne&s;t with me to prevent it, that I could no &s;tay. It is over by this time&mdash;She rang.</P>
<P>At that moment, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all three, in ran the dear Clementina her&s;elf.&mdash;A happy e&s;cape! Thank God! &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Her arm bound up.</P>
<P>She had felt the lancet; but did not bleed more than two or three drops.</P>
<P>O my mamma! And <HI>you</HI> would have run away from me too, would you!&mdash;You don't u&s;e to be cruel; and to leave me with the&s;e doctors&mdash;See! &s;ee! and &s;he held out her lovely arm a little boody, re|garding nobody but her mother; who, as well as w, was &s;peechle&s;s with &s;urprize&mdash;They did attempt to wound; but they could not obtain their cruel ends&mdash;And I ran for &s;helter to my mamma's arms (throwing hers about her neck) Deare&s;t, deare&s;t madam, don't let me be &s;acrificed. What has your poor child done, to be thus treated?&mdash;</P>
<P>O my Clementina!</P>
<P>And O my mamma, too! Have I not &s;uffered enough!&mdash;</P>
<P>The door opened. She ca&s;t her fearful eye to it, clinging fa&s;ter to her mother.&mdash;They are come to take me! Begone, Camilla (It was &s;he) begone, when I bid you! They &s;ha'n't take me&mdash;My mam|ma will &s;ave me from them&mdash;Won't you, my mam|ma? cla&s;ping more &s;ervently her arms about her neck, and hiding her face in her bo&s;om. Then lifting up her face, Begone, I tell you, Camilla. They &s;ha'n't have me.&punc;Camilla withdrew.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="281">
Brother! my dear brother! you will protect me: won't you?</P>
<P>I aro&s;e. I was unable to bear this affecting &s;cene&mdash;She &s;aw me.</P>
<P>Good God! &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;Then in Engli&s;h breaking out into that line of Hamlet, which &s;he had taken great notice of, when we read that play together&mdash;
<Q><L>Angels, and mini&s;ters of grace, defend us!</L></Q>
She left her mother, and &s;tept gently towards me, looking earne&s;tly with her face held out, as if &s;he were doubtful whether it were I, or not.</P>
<P>I &s;natched her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it with my lips&mdash;O madam!&mdash;Deare&s;t Lady!&mdash;I could &s;ay no more.</P>
<P>It is he! It is he, indeed, madam! turning her head to her mother, one hand held up, as in &s;urprize, as I detained the other.</P>
<P>The &s;on's arms &s;upported the almo&s;t fainting mo|ther; his tears mingling with hers.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake! for my &s;ake, dear Grandi&s;on! &s;aid he, and &s;topt.</P>
<P>I quitted Clementina's hand; Jeronymo's unheal|ed wounds had weakened him, and I ha&s;tened to &s;upport the Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>O Chevalier! &s;pare your concern for me, &s;aid &s;he. My child's <HI>head</HI> is of more con&s;equence to me, than my own <HI>heart.</HI></P>
<P>What was it of di&s;tre&s;s that I did not at that mo|ment feel!</P>
<P>The young Lady turning to us&mdash;Well, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, Here is &s;ad work! Sad work, to be &s;ure! Some|body is wrong: I won't &s;ay who.&mdash;But <HI>you</HI> will not let the&s;e doctors u&s;e me ill&mdash;Will you?&mdash;See here! &s;hewing her bound up arm to me&mdash;what they would have done!&mdash;See!

<P>Her mother then taking her attention, My deare&s;t mamma! How do you!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="282">
O my child! and &s;he cla&s;ped her arms about her Clementina.</P>
<P>Camilla came in. She added by <HI>her</HI> grief to the di|&s;tre&s;sful &s;cene. She threw her arms, kneeling, about the Marchione&s;s: O my deare&s;t Lady! &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;The Marchione&s;s feeling for her <HI>&s;alts,</HI> and taking them out of her pocket, and &s;melling to them; Uncla&s;p me, Camilla, &s;aid &s;he: I am better.

<P>No, madam, whi&s;pered Camilla: But they &s;ay, It is highly proper; and they talk of bli&s;tering!&mdash;</P>
<P>Not her head, I hope!&mdash;The dear creature, when &s;he u&s;ed to value her&s;elf upon any-thing, took pride, as well &s;he might, in her hair.</P>

<P>Her brother begged of her to &s;ubmit to the opera|tion.

<P>Per&s;uade her, Chevalier, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>My good young Lady, Will you not obey your mamma? You are not well. Will you not be well? See how you di&s;tre&s;s your noble brother!</P>

And have you not &s;uffered enough from vile a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins? Poor dear brother!&mdash;and again &s;troked his cheek&mdash;How was I affected!</P>

<P>A Scene of another nature took place of this, pro|ceeds Mr. Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;tept in, and &s;aid, The General was come; and was at that moment lamenting with the Mar|chione&s;s the di&s;ordered &s;tate of mind of his beloved &s;i&s;ter; who had again fainted away; but was quiet when Camilla came in.</P>
<P>The General will be here pre&s;ently, &s;aid Jero|nymo. Do you choo&s;e to &s;ee him?</P>
<P>As, perhaps, he has been told I am here, it would look too particular to depart in&s;tantly. If he comes not in &s;oon, I will take my leave of you.</P>
<P>I had hardly done &s;peaking, when the General en|tered, drying his eyes.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Mr. Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he. Brother,
<PB N="283" REF="286">
How do you? Not the better, I dare &s;ay, for the pre|&s;ent affliction. Who the devil would have thought the girl had been &s;o deeply affected?&mdash;Well, Sir, you have a glorious triumph!&mdash;Clementina's heart is not a vulgar one. Her family&mdash;</P>
<P>My Lord, I hope I do not de&s;erve this addre&s;s!&mdash;<HI>Triumph,</HI> my Lord!&mdash;Not a heart in this family can be more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than mine.</P>
<P>And is religion, is con&s;cience, <HI>really</HI> of &s;uch force, Chevalier?</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k that que&s;tion, my Lord, of your own heart: Let me a&s;k it of your brother the Bi&s;hop; of the other principles of your noble family: And the an&s;wer given will be an an&s;wer for me.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed. Explain your&s;elf, Cheva|lier.</P>
<P>If, my Lord, &s;aid I, you think there is &s;o great, &s;o e&s;&s;ential, a difference in the two religions, that you cannot con&s;ent that I &s;hould keep my own; What mu&s;t I be, who think as highly of my own as you can of yours, to give it up, tho' on the highe&s;t temporal con&s;ideration? Make the ca&s;e your own, my Lord.</P>
<P>I <HI>can.</HI> And were I in your &s;ituation, &s;uch a wo|man as my &s;i&s;ter; &s;uch a family as ours; &s;uch a &s;plendid fortune as &s;he will have; I believe, I &s;hould not make the &s;cruples you do. My brother the Bi&s;hop indeed might not have given the &s;ame an&s;wer: He might be more tenacious.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop cannot be better &s;atisfied with <HI>his</HI> re|ligion than I am with <HI>mine.</HI> But I hope, my Lord, <HI>from what you have &s;aid,</HI> that I may claim the honour of your friend&s;hip in this great article. It is propo&s;ed to me, that I renounce my religion: I make no &s;uch propo&s;al to your family: On the contrary, I con&s;ent that Lady Clementina &s;hould keep hers; and I am ready to allow a very hand&s;ome provi&s;ion for a di&s;creet man, her confe&s;&s;or, to attend her, in order to &s;ecure her in it. As to re&s;idence; I will con&s;ent to re&s;ide
<PB N="284" REF="287">
one year in Italy, one in England; and even, if &s;he choo&s;e not to go to England at all, I will acquie&s;ce; and vi&s;it England my&s;elf but for three months in every year.</P>
<P>As to the children, Mr. Grandi&s;on? &s;aid Signor Je|ronymo; de&s;irous of promoting the compromi&s;e.</P>
<P>I will con&s;ent that daughters &s;hall be the mother's care; the education of &s;ons mu&s;t be left to me.</P>
<P>What will the poor daughters have done, Cheva|lier, &s;neeringly &s;poke the General, that <HI>they</HI> &s;hould be left to perdition?</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip, without my entering into the opi|nion of the profe&s;&s;ors of both religions on this &s;ubject, will con&s;ider my propo&s;al as a <HI>compromi&s;e.</HI> I would not have began an addre&s;s upon the&s;e terms with a prince&s;s. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that mere fortune has no bias with me. Pre&s;cribe not to me in the article of religion, and I will, with all my &s;oul, give up every ducat of your &s;i&s;ter's fortune.</P>
<P>Then what will you have to &s;upport&mdash;</P>
<P>My Lord, leave that to your &s;i&s;ter and me. I will deal honourably with her. If &s;he renounce me on that article, you will have rea&s;on to congratulate your&s;elves.</P>
<P>Your fortune, Sir, by marriage, will be much more con&s;iderable than it can be by patrimony, if Clemen|tina be yours: Why then &s;hould you not look forward to your po&s;terity as Italians? And in <HI>that</HI> ca&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topt there&mdash;It was ea&s;y to gue&s;s at his infe|rence.</P>
<P>I would no more renounce my Country than my Religion: I would leave po&s;terity free; but would not deprive them of an attachment that I value my&s;elf upon: Nor yet my country, of a family that never gave it cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed of it.</P>
<P>The General took &s;nuff, and looked on me, and off me, with an air too &s;upercilious. I could not but be &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P>I have no &s;mall difficulty, my Lord, &s;aid I, to bear
<PB N="285" REF="288">
the hard&s;hips of my &s;ituation, added to the di&s;tre&s;s which that &s;ituation gives me, to be looked upon in this family as a delinquent, without having done any|thing to reproach my&s;elf with, either in thought, word, or deed&mdash;My Lord, it is extremely hard.</P>
<P>It is, my Lord, &s;aid Signor Jeronymo. The great misfortune in the ca&s;e before us, is, that the Chevalier Grandi&s;on has merit &s;uperior to that of mo&s;t men; and that our &s;i&s;ter, who was not to be attached by common merit, could not be in&s;en&s;ible to his.</P>
<P>Whatever were my &s;i&s;ter's attachments, Signor Je|ronymo, we know <HI>yours;</HI> and generous ones they are: But we all know how hand&s;ome men may attach young Ladies, without needing to &s;ay a &s;ingle word. The poi&s;on once taken in at the eye, it will &s;oon dif|fu&s;e it&s;elf through the whole ma&s;s.</P>
<P>My honour, yet, my Lord, was never called in que&s;tion, either by man or woman.</P>
<P>Your character is well known, Chevalier&mdash;Had it not been unexceptionable, we &s;hould not have enter|ed into treaty with you on this &s;ubject, I do a&s;&s;ure you; and it piques us not a little to have a daughter of our hou&s;e refu&s;ed. You don't know the con&s;e|quence, I can tell you, of &s;uch an indignity offered in this country.</P>
<P><HI>Refu&s;ed!</HI> my Lord!&mdash;To <HI>endeavour</HI> to obviate this charge, would be to put an affront upon your Lord&s;hip's ju&s;tice, as well as an indignity offered to your truly noble hou&s;e.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e in anger, and &s;wore that he would not be treated with contempt.</P>
<P>I &s;tood up too; And if <HI>I</HI> am, my Lord, with in|diguity, it is not what I have been u&s;ed to bear.</P>
<P>Signor Jeronymo was di&s;turbed. He &s;aid, He was again&s;t our &s;eeing each other. He knew his brother's warmth; and I, he &s;aid, from the &s;cenes that had before pa&s;&s;ed, ought perhaps to have &s;hewn more pity than re&s;entment.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="289">
It was owing to my regard for the delicacy of you &s;i&s;ter, Signor Jeronymo, &s;aid I (for whom I have the tendere&s;t &s;entiments), as well as to do Ju&s;tice to my own conduct towards her, that I could not help &s;how|ing my&s;elf affected by the word <HI>refu&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Affected by the word refu&s;ed!</HI> Sir, &s;aid the Gene|ral&mdash;Yes, you have &s;oft words for hard meanings. But I, who have not your choice of words, make u&s;e of tho&s;e that are explained by actions.</P>
<P>I was in hopes, my Lord, that I might rather have been favoured with your weight in the propo&s;ed com|promi&s;e, than to have met with your di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, Chevalier, coolly con&s;ider this matter: How &s;hall we an&s;wer it to our country? (We are pub|lic people, Sir); to the church, to which we &s;tand re|lated; to our own character: to marry a daughter of our hou&s;e to a Prote&s;tant? You &s;ay you are concern|ed for her honour: What <HI>mu&s;t</HI> we, what <HI>can</HI> we &s;ay in her behalf, when &s;he is reflected upon as a Love|&s;ick girl, who, tho' &s;tedfa&s;t in her religion, could re|fu&s;e men of the fir&s;t con&s;ideration, all of her own re|ligion and country, and let a foreigner, an Engli&s;h|man, carry her off?&mdash;</P>
<P>Pre&s;erving neverthele&s;s by <HI>&s;tipulation,</HI> you will re|member, my Lord, her religion.&mdash;If you &s;hall have &s;o much to an&s;wer for to the world with &s;uch a &s;tipu|lation in the Lady's favour, What &s;hall I be thought of, who, tho' I am not, nor wi&s;h to be, a public man, am not of a low or incon&s;iderable family, if I, again&s;t my con&s;cience, renounce my religion and my coun|try, for a con&s;ideration, that, tho' the highe&s;t in pri|vate life, is a partial and &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration?</P>
<P>No more, no more, Sir&mdash;If you can de&s;pi&s;e worldly grandeur; if you can &s;et light by Riches, Honours, Love; my &s;i&s;ter has this to be &s;aid in her prai&s;e, that &s;he is the fir&s;t woman, that ever I heard of, who f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ll in love with a philo&s;opher: And &s;he mu&s;t, I think, take the con&s;equence of &s;uch a peculiarity. Her ex|ample will not have many followers.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="290">
Yes, my Lord, it will, &s;aid Jeronymo, if Mr. Grandi&s;on be the philo&s;opher. If women were to be regimented, he would carry an army into the field without beat of drum.</P>
<P>I was vexed to find an affair that had penetrated my heart, go off &s;o lightly; but the levity &s;hewn by the General was followed by Jeronymo, in order to make the pa&s;t warmth between us forgotten.</P>
<P>I left the brothers together. As I pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;alon, I had the plea&s;ure of hearing, by a whi&s;per from Camilla, that her young Lady was &s;omewhat more compo&s;ed for the operation &s;he had yielded to.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the General made me a vi&s;it at my lodgings. He told me, he had taken ami&s;s &s;ome things that had fallen from my mouth.</P>
<P>I owned that I was at one time warm; but excu&s;ed my&s;elf by <HI>his</HI> example.</P>
<P>I urged him to promote my intere&s;t as to the pro|po&s;ed compromi&s;e. He gave me no encouragement; but took down my propo&s;als in writing.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked me, If my father were as tenacious in the article of religion as I was?</P>
<P>I told him, That I had forborn to write any-thing of the affair to my father.</P>
<P><HI>That,</HI> he &s;aid, was &s;urpri&s;ing. He had always ap|prehended, that a man who pretended to be &s;trict in religion, be it what religion it would, &s;hould be uni|form. He who could di&s;pen&s;e with one duty, might with another.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered, That having no view to addre&s;s Lady Clementina, I had only given my father general ac|counts of the favour I had met with from a family &s;o con&s;iderable: That it was but <HI>very lately</HI> that I had entertained any hopes <HI>at all,</HI> as he mu&s;t know: That tho&s;e hopes were allayed by my fears that the articles of religion and re&s;idence would be an in&s;uperable ob|&s;tacle: But that it was my re&s;olution, in the &s;ame hour that I could have any pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding, to

lay all before him; and I was &s;ure of his approbation and con&s;ent to an alliance &s;o an&s;werable to the magni|&s;icence of his own &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The General, at parting, with an haughty air, &s;aid, I take my leave, Chevalier: I &s;uppo&s;e you will not be in ha&s;te to <HI>leave</HI> Bologna. I am extremely &s;en&s;ible of the indignity you have ca&s;t upon us all. I <HI>am,</HI> and &s;wore&mdash;We &s;hall not di&s;grace our &s;i&s;ter and our&s;elves, by courting your acceptance of her. I under&s;tand, that Olivia is in Love with you too. The&s;e conten|tions for you may give you con&s;equence with your&s;elf. But Olivia is not a <HI>Clementina.</HI> You are in a country jealous of family-honour. Ours is a fir&s;t family in it. You know not what you have done, Sir.</P>
<P>What you have &s;aid, my Lord, I have not de&s;erved of you. It can-<HI>not</HI> be an&s;wered, at lea&s;t by me. I &s;hall not leave Bologna till I apprize you of it, and till I have the misfortune to be a&s;&s;ured, that I cannot have any hope of the honour once de&s;igned me. I will only add, That my principles were well known before I was written to at Vienna.</P>
<P>And do you reproach us with that &s;tep? It was a <HI>ba&s;e</HI> one: It had not <HI>my</HI> concurrence. He went from me in a pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I had enough at my heart, Dr. Bartlett, had I been &s;pared this in&s;ult from a brother of Clementina. It went very hard with me to be threatened. But I thank God, I do not de&s;erve the treatment.</P>

In reading the two latter, we were &s;truck (for the two &s;i&s;ters and my Lord were with us) with the noblene&s;s of Clementina.

<P>I Had another vi&s;it paid me, proceeds Mr. Gran|di&s;on, two hours after the general left me, by the kind-hearted Camilla, di&s;gui&s;ed as before.</P>
<P>I come now, Chevalier, &s;aid &s;he, with the Mar|chione&s;s's connivance, and I may &s;ay, by her com|mand; and at the &s;ame time, by the command of Signor Jeronymo, who knows of my la&s;t attendance upon you, tho' no one el&s;e does, not even the Mar|chione&s;s. He gave me this Letter for you.</P>
<P>But how does the noble&s;t young Lady in Italy, Ca|milla? How does Lady Clementina?</P>
<P>More compo&s;ed than we could have hoped for from the height of her dilirum. It <HI>was</HI> high; for &s;he has but a very faint idea of having &s;een you this morning.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s had bid her &s;ay, that altho I had now given her de&s;pair in&s;tead of hope, yet that &s;he owed it to my merit, and to the &s;en&s;e &s;he had of the benefits they had actually received at my hands, to let me know, that it was but too likely that re&s;entments might be carried to an unhappy length; and that therefore &s;he wi&s;hed I would leave Bologna for the pre&s;ent. If happier pro&s;pects pre&s;ented, &s;he would be the fir&s;t to congratulate me upon them.</P>

I opened the Letter of my kind Jeronymo. The&s;e were the contents:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Am infinitely concerned, my dear Grandi&s;on, to find a man equally generous and brave as my bro|thor is, hurried away by pa&s;&s;ion. You <HI>may</HI> have acted with your u&s;ual magnaminity in preferring your Religion to your Love, and to your Glory. I, for my part, think you to be a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed man. If you are not, you mu&s;t be very in&s;en&s;ible to the merits of an excellent woman, and very ungrateful to the di|&s;tinction &s;he honours you with. I mu&s;t write in this &s;tile, and think &s;he does honour by it even to my Grandi&s;on. But &s;hould the con&s;equences of this affair be unhappy for either of you; if, in particular, for my <HI>brother;</HI> What cau&s;e of regret would our family have, that a <HI>younger</HI> brother was &s;aved by the hand which deprived them of a more worthy <HI>elder?</HI> If for <HI>you,</HI> how deplorable would be the reflexion, that you &s;aved one brother, and peri&s;hed by the hand of another! Would to God that his pa&s;&s;ion, and your &s;pirit, were more moderate! But let me reque&s;t this favour of you; That you retire to Florence, for a few days, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>How unhappy am I, that I am di&s;abled from taking part in a more active mediation!&mdash;Yet the General admires you. But how can we blame in him a zeal for the honour of this family, in which he would be glad at his &s;oul to include a zeal for yours?</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake quit Bologna for a few days only. Clementina is more &s;edate. I have carried it, that her confe&s;&s;or &s;hall not at pre&s;ent vi&s;it her; yet he is an hone&s;t and a pious man.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I &s;ent my grateful compliments to the Marchione&s;s by Camilla. I be&s;ought her to believe, that my con|duct on this occa&s;ion &s;hould be &s;uch as &s;hould merit her approbation. I expre&s;&s;ed my grief for the appre|hended re&s;entments. I was &s;ure that a man &s;o noble, &s;o generous, &s;o brave, as was the man from whom the re&s;entments might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e, would better con&s;ider of every thing: But it was impo&s;&s;ible for me, I bid Camilla &s;ay, to be far di&s;tant from Bo|logna; becau&s;e I &s;till pre&s;umed to hope for a happy turn in my favour.</P>
<P>I wrote to Signor Jeronymo to the &s;ame effect. I a&s;&s;ured him of my high regard for his gallant brother: I deplored the occa&s;ion which had &s;ubjected me to the General's di&s;plea&s;ure; bid him depend upon my mo|deration. I referred to my known re&s;olution of long &s;tanding, to avoid a meditated rencounter with <HI>any</HI> man; urging, that he might, for that rea&s;on, the more &s;ecurely rely upon my care to &s;hun any acts of offence either to or from a &s;on of the Marquis della Porretta; a brother of my dear friend Jeronymo, and of the mo&s;t excellent and beloved of &s;i&s;ters!</P>
<P>Neither the Marchione&s;s nor Jeronymo were &s;a|tisfied with the an&s;wers I returned: But what could I do? I had promi&s;ed the General that I would not leave Bologna till I had apprized him of my intention to do &s;o; and I &s;till was willing, as I bid Camilla tell the Marchione&s;s, to indulge my hopes of &s;ome happy turn.</P>
<P>The Marquis, the Bi&s;hop, and General, went to Ur|bino; and there, as I learnt from my Jeronymo, it was determined, in full a&s;&s;embly, that Grandi&s;on, as well from difference in Religion, as from inferiority in degree and fortune, was unworthy of their alliance: And it was
<PB N="292" REF="295">
hinted to the General, that he was equally unworthy of his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>While the father and two brothers were at Urbino, Lady Clementina gave hopes of a &s;edate mind. She de&s;ired her mother to allow her to &s;ee me: But the Marchione&s;s believing there were no hopes of my complying with their terms, and being afraid of the con&s;equences, and of incurring blame from the re&s;t of her family, now e&s;pecially, that they were ab&s;ent, and con&s;ulting together on what <HI>was</HI> proper to be done; de&s;ired &s;he would not think of it.</P>
<P>This refu&s;al made Clementina the more earne&s;t for an interview. Signor Jeronymo gave his advice in favour of it. The misfortune he had met with, had added to his weight with the family. It is a fa|mily of harmony and love. They were hardly more particularly fond of Clementina than they were of one another, throughout the &s;everal branches of it: This harmony among them added greatly to the fa|mily-con&s;equence, as well in public as private. Till the attempt that was made upon their Jeronymo, they had not known calamity.</P>
<P>But the confe&s;&s;or &s;trengthening the Marchione&s;s's apprehen&s;ions of what the con&s;equence of indulging the young Lady might be, all Jeronymo's weight would have failed to carry this point, had it not been for an enterprize of Clementina, which ex|tremely alarmed them, and made them give into her wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Camilla has enabled me to give the following mel|ancholy account of it, to the only man on earth to whom I could communicate particulars, the very re|collection of which, tears my heart in pieces.</P>
<P>The young Lady's malady, after &s;ome favourable &s;ymptoms which went off, returned in another &s;hape; her talkativene&s;s continued; but the hurry with which &s;he &s;poke and acted, gave place to a &s;edatene&s;s that &s;he &s;eemed very fond of. They did not &s;uffer her to go
<PB N="293" REF="296">
out of her chamber; which &s;he took not well: But Camilla being ab&s;ent about an hour; on her return mi&s;&s;ed her, and alarmed the whole hou&s;e upon it. Every part of it, and of the garden, was &s;earched. From an apprehen&s;ion that they dared not &s;o much as whi&s;per to one another, they <HI>dreaded</HI> to find her whom they &s;o carefully &s;ought after.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Camilla &s;eeing, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, one of the maid-&s;ervants coming down-&s;tairs with remarkable tranquillity, as &s;he thought, in her air and manner; Wretch! &s;aid &s;he, how compo&s;ed do you &s;eem to be in a &s;torm that agitates every-body el&s;e!</P>
<P>Don't be angry with me, Camilla, returned the &s;up|po&s;ed &s;ervant.</P>
<P>O my Lady! my <HI>very</HI> Lady Clementina, in Laura's cloaths! Whither are you going, madam?&mdash;But let the Marchione&s;s know, &s;aid &s;he, to one of the wo|men-&s;ervants who then appeared in &s;ight, that we have found my young Lady&mdash;What, dear madam, is the meaning of this?&mdash;Go, Martina, to another woman|&s;ervant, go this in&s;tant to my Lady!&mdash;Dear Lady Clementina, what concern have you given us!</P>
<P>And thus &s;he went on, a&s;king que&s;tions of her young Lady, and giving orders, almo&s;t in the &s;ame breath, till the Marchione&s;s came to them in a joyful hurry, from one of the pavilions in the garden, into which &s;he had thrown her&s;elf; tortured by her fears, and dreading the approach of every &s;ervant, with fatal tidings.</P>
<P>The young Lady &s;tood &s;till, but with great com|po&s;ure. I <HI>will</HI> go, Camilla, &s;aid &s;he; indeed I will. You di&s;turb me by your frantic ways, Camilla. I wi&s;h you would be as &s;edate and calm as I am: What's the matter with the woman?</P>
<P>Her mother folding her arms about her&mdash;O my &s;weet girl! &s;aid &s;he, How could you terrify us thus; What's the meaning of this di&s;gui&s;e? Whither were you going?</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="297">
Why, madam, I was going on God's errand; not on my own.&mdash;What is come to Camilla? The poor creature is be&s;ide her&s;elf!</P>
<P>O my dear! &s;aid her mother, taking her hand, and leading her into her own apartment, (Camilla follow|ing, weeping with joy for having found her) Tell me, &s;aid &s;he, tell me, has Laura furni&s;hed you with this dre&s;s?</P>
<P>Why no, madam: I'll tell you the whole truth. I went and hid my&s;elf in Laura's room, while &s;he changed her cloaths: I &s;aw where &s;he put tho&s;e &s;he took off; and when &s;he had left her room, I put them on.</P>
<P>And for what? For what, my dear? Tell me what you de&s;igned?</P>
<P>I am neither afraid nor a&s;hamed to tell. It was God's errand I was going upon.</P>
<P>What <HI>was</HI> the errand?</P>
<P>Don't weep them, my dear mamma, and I'll tell you. Do, let me ki&s;s away the&s;e tears.&mdash;And &s;he tenderly embraced her mother.</P>
<P>Why, I have a great mind to talk to the Chevalier Grandi&s;on. I had many fine thoughts upon my pil|low; and I believed I could &s;ay a great deal to the purpo&s;e to him; and you told me I mu&s;t not &s;ee him: So I thought I would not. But then I had other no|tions came into my head; and I believed, if I could talk freely to him, I &s;hould convince him of his er|rors. Now, thought I, I know he will mind what I &s;ay to him, more than perhaps he will my brother the Bi&s;hop, or Father Mare&s;cotti. I am a &s;imple girl, and can have no intere&s;t in his conver&s;ion; for he has refu&s;ed me, you know: So there is an end of all matters between him and me. I never was refu&s;ed before: <HI>Was</HI> I, my mamma? I never will be twice refu&s;ed. Yet I owe him no ill-will. And if one can &s;ave a &s;oul, you know, madam, there is no harm in that. So it is God's errand I go upon, and not my
<PB N="295" REF="298">
own. And &s;hall I not go? Yes, I &s;hall. I know you will give me leave.&mdash;She courte&s;ied. Silence is permi&s;&s;ion! Thank you, madam.&mdash;And &s;eemed to be going.</P>
<P>Well might her mother be &s;ilent. She could not &s;peak; but ri&s;ing, went after her to the door, and taking her hand, &s;obbed over it her denial (as Camilla de&s;cribed it), and brought her back, and motioned to her to &s;it down&mdash;</P>
<P>She whi&s;pered Camilla, What ails my mamma? Can you tell?&mdash;But &s;ee how calm, how compo&s;ed I am! This world, Camilla! what a vain thing is this world! and &s;he looked up. And &s;o I &s;hall tell the Chevalier. I &s;hall tell him not to refu&s;e heaven, tho' he has refu&s;ed a &s;imple girl, that was no enemy to him, and might have been a faithful guide to him thither, for what he knew. Now all the&s;e things I wanted to &s;ay to him, and a va&s;t deal more; and when I have told him my mind, I &s;hall be ea&s;y.</P>
<P><HI>Will</HI> my precious girl be ea&s;y, broke out into &s;peech her weeping mother, when you have told the Chevalier your mind? You <HI>&s;hall</HI> tell him your mind, my dear; and God re&s;tore my child to peace, and to me!</P>
<P>Well now, my mamma, this is a good &s;ign&mdash;For if I have moved you to oblige me, Why may I not move him to oblige him&s;elf?&mdash;That's all I have in view. He has been my tutor, and I want, methinks, to return the favour, and be his tutre&s;s; and &s;o you will let me go&mdash;Won't you?</P>
<P>No, my dear, we will &s;end for him.</P>
<P>Well, that may do as well, provided you will let us be alone together: For the&s;e proud men may be a&s;hamed before company, to own them&s;elves con|vinced by a &s;imple girl.</P>
<P>But, my deare&s;t Love, Whither would you have gone? Do you know where the Chevalier's lodgings are?</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="299">
She pau&s;ed.&mdash;She does not &s;urely, Camilla!</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s eighth Letter.</HEAD>
<P>I Proceed now to give an account of Mr. Gran|di&s;on's interview with Lady Clementina.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner heard the preceding particulars, than he ha&s;tened to her, tho' with a tortured heart.</P>
<P>He was introduced to&punc; the Marchione&s;s and Signor Jeronymo, in the apartment of the latter.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, after fir&s;t civilities,
<PB N="297" REF="300">
Camilla has told you the way we are now in. The dear creature has a great de&s;ire to talk with you. Who knows, but &s;he may he ea&s;ier after &s;he has been humoured?&mdash;She is more compo&s;ed than &s;he was, &s;ince &s;he knows &s;he may expect to &s;ee you. Poor thing! &s;he has hopes of converting you.</P>
<P>Would to heaven, &s;aid Jeronymo, that compa&s;&s;ion for her di&s;ordered mind, may have that effect upon my Grandi&s;on, which argument has not had!&mdash;Poor Grandi&s;on! I can pity you at my heart. The&s;e are hard trials to your humanity! Your de&s;tre&s;s is written in your countenance!</P>
<P>It is deeper written in my heart, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Indeed, Dr. Bartlett, it was.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s rang. Camilla came in. See, &s;aid &s;he, if Clementina is di&s;po&s;ed now to admit of the Chevalier's vi&s;it; and a&s;k her, If &s;he will have her mamma introduce him to her.</P>
<P>By all means, was the an&s;wer returned.</P>
<P>Clementina at our entrance was &s;itting at the win|dow, a book in her hand. She &s;tood up. A great, but &s;olemn compo&s;ure appeared in her air and a&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s went to the window, holding her handkerchief at her eyes. I approached with pro|found re&s;pect her Clementina; but my heart was too full to &s;peak fir&s;t&mdash;<HI>She</HI> could &s;peak. She did, with|out he&s;itation&mdash;</P>
<P>You are nothing to me now, Chevalier: You have refu&s;ed me, you know; and I thank you: You are in the right, I believe. I am a very proud creature. And you &s;aw what trouble I gave to the be&s;t of pa|rents, and friends. You are certainly in the right. She that can give &s;o much concern to them, mu&s;t make any man afraid of her. But Religion, it &s;eems, is your pretence. Now I am &s;orry that you are an ob&s;tinate m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n. You <HI>know</HI> better, Chevalier. I think you <HI>&s;hould</HI> know better. But you have been my tutor. Shall I be yours?</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="301">
I &s;hall attend to every in&s;truction that you will ho|nour me with.</P>
<P>But let me, Sir, comfort my mamma.</P>
<P>She went to her, and kneeled: Why weeps my mamma? taking a hand in each of hers, and ki&s;&s;ing fir&s;t one, then the other. Be comforted, my mamma. You &s;ee, I am quite well. You &s;ee I am &s;edate.&mdash;Ble&s;s your Clementina!</P>
<P>God ble&s;s my child!</P>
<P>She aro&s;e from her knees; and &s;tepping towards me&mdash;You are very &s;ilent, Sir; and very &s;ad&mdash;But I don't want you to be &s;ad.&mdash;Silent I will allow you to be; becau&s;e the tutored &s;hould be all ear. So I u&s;ed to be to you.</P>
<P>She then turned her face from me, putting her hand to her forehead&mdash;I had a great deal to &s;ay to you; but I have forgot it all&mdash;Why do you look &s;o melan|choly, Chevalier? You know your own mind; and you did what you thought ju&s;t and fit&mdash;Did you not? Tell me, Sir.</P>
<P>Then turning to her weeping mother&mdash;The poor Chevalier cannot &s;peak, madam&mdash;Yet had nobody to bid him do this, or bid him do that&mdash;He is &s;orry, to be &s;ure!&mdash;Well, but, Sir, turning to me, Don't be &s;orry.&mdash;And yet the man who once refu&s;ed me&mdash;Ah, Chevalier! I thought that was very cruel of you: But I &s;oon got over it. You &s;ee how &s;edate I am now. Cannot you be as &s;edate as I am?</P>
<P>What could I &s;ay? I could not &s;ooth her; &s;he boa&s;ted of her &s;edatene&s;s. I could not argue with her. Could I have been hers, could my compromi&s;e have been allowed of, I could have been unre&s;erved in my declarations. Was ever man &s;o unhappily circum|&s;tanced?&mdash;Why did not the family forbid me to come near them? Why did not my Jeronymo renounce friend&s;hip with me? Why did this excellent mother bind me to her, by the &s;weet ties of kindne&s;s and e&s;teem; engaging all my reverence and gratitude?</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="302">
But let me a&s;k you, Chevalier, How could you be &s;o <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> as to expect, that I &s;hould change my religion, when you were &s;o very tenacious of yours? Were you not <HI>very</HI> unrea&s;onable to expect this?&mdash;Upon my word, I believe, you men think, it is no matter for us women to have any con&s;ciences, &s;o as we do but &s;tudy your wills, and do our duty by you. Men look upon them&s;elves as gods of the earth, and on us women but as their mini&s;tring &s;ervants!&mdash;But I did not expect that <HI>you</HI> would be &s;o unrea&s;onable. You u&s;ed to &s;peak highly of our Sex. Good women, You u&s;ed to &s;ay, were angels. And many a time have you made me proud that I <HI>was</HI> a woman. How could <HI>you,</HI> Chevalier, be &s;o unrea&s;onable?</P>
<P>May I, madam, to her mother, acquaint her with the propo&s;als I made?&mdash;She &s;eems to think, that I in&s;i&s;ted upon her change of religion.</P>
<P>It was not de&s;igned &s;he &s;hould think &s;o: But I remember now, that &s;he would not let me tell all I had to &s;ay, when I was making my report to her of what had pa&s;&s;ed between the Bi&s;hop and you. It was enough, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he had been refu&s;ed; &s;he be|&s;ought me to &s;pare the re&s;t: And &s;ince that, &s;he has not been in &s;uch a way that we <HI>could</HI> talk to her on that part of the &s;ubject. We took it for granted, that <HI>&s;he</HI> knew it all, becau&s;e <HI>we</HI> did. Could we have yielded to your propo&s;als, we &s;hould have enforced them upon her.&mdash;If you acquaint her with what you had propo&s;ed, it may make her think &s;he has not been <HI>di&s;pi&s;ed,</HI> as &s;he calls it; the notion of which changed her temper, from over-thoughtful to over-lively.</P>
<P>No need of &s;peaking low to each other, &s;aid the young Lady. After your &s;light, Sir, you may let me hear <HI>any-thing.</HI> &mdash;Madam! you &s;ee how &s;edate I am. I have quite overcome my&s;elf. Don't be afraid of &s;aying <HI>any-thing</HI> before me.</P>

<P>Yes, and me the unhappie&s;t of women. Why you refu&s;ed me, did you not? And putting both her hands &s;pread before her face; Don't let it be told abroad, that a daughter of that be&s;t of mothers was refu&s;ed by any man le&s;s than a Prince!&mdash;Fie upon that daughter! To be able to &s;tand before the proud refu&s;er! [She walked from me.] I am a&s;hamed of my|&s;elf!&mdash;O Mrs. Beaumont!

<P>How her mother wept! How was I affected!</P>
<P>I had a great deal to &s;ay to you, I thought: I wanted to convince you of your errors. I wanted <HI>no</HI> favour of you, Sir: Mine was a pure, di&s;intere&s;ted e&s;teem. A voice from heaven, I thought, bid me convert you. I was &s;etting out to convert you: I &s;hould have been enabled to do it, I doubt not; <HI>Out of the mouth of babes and &s;ucklings;</HI> Do you remem|ber that text, Sir?&mdash;Could I have gone, when I would have gone&mdash;I had it <HI>all</HI> in my head then&mdash;But now I have lo&s;t it&mdash;O that impertinent Camilla!&mdash;<HI>She</HI> mu&s;t que&s;tion me&mdash;The woman addre&s;&s;ed me in a quite frantic way. She was vexed to &s;ee me &s;o &s;edate.</P>
<P>I was going to &s;peak&mdash;Hu&s;h, hu&s;h, when I bid you! and &s;he put her hand before my mouth. With both my hands I held it there for a moment, and ki&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier! &s;aid &s;he, not withdrawing it, I be|lieve you are a flattering man! How <HI>can</HI> you, to a poor <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> girl&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me <HI>now</HI> &s;peak, madam&mdash;U&s;e not a word that I cannot repeat after you. Let me beg of you to hear the propo&s;als I made&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="304">
I mentioned them; and added, Heaven only knows the angui&s;h of my &s;oul&mdash;Hu&s;h, &s;aid &s;he, interrupting, and turning to her mother&mdash;I know nothing of the&s;e men, madam!

<P>Her mother was &s;ilent, through grief.</P>
<P>Ah, Sir! My mamma, tho' &s;he is not your enemy cannot vouch for you!&mdash;But I will have you bound by your own hand. She &s;tept to her clo&s;et in a hurry, and brought out pen, ink, and paper.&mdash;Come, Sir, you mu&s;t not play tricks with me. Give me under your hand, what you have now &s;aid&mdash;But I will write it, and you &s;hall &s;ign it.</P>
<P>She wrote, in an in&s;tant, as follows:</P>
<P>The Chevalier Grandi&s;on &s;olemnly declares, That he did, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, of his own accord, propo&s;e, that he would <HI>allow</HI> a certain young creature, if &s;he might be <HI>al|lowed</HI> to be his wife, the free u&s;e of her reli|gion; and to have a di&s;creet man, at her choice, for her confe&s;&s;or: And that he would never oblige her to go to England with him: And that he would live in Italy with her every other year.</P>
<P>Will you &s;ign this, Sir?&mdash;Mo&s;t willingly.&mdash;Do then.&mdash;I did.</P>
<P>And you <HI>did</HI> propo&s;e this?&mdash;Did he, madam?</P>
<P>My dear, he did. And I would have told you &s;o; but that you were affected at his &s;uppo&s;ed refu&s;al.</P>
<P>Why, to be &s;ure, madam, interrupted &s;he, it was a &s;hocking thing to be <HI>refu&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>Would you have wi&s;hed us, my dear, to comply with the&s;e terms? Would you have cho&s;en to marry a Prote&s;tant? A daughter of the hou&s;e of Porretta, and of the hou&s;e I &s;prung from, to marry an Engli&s;h Prote&s;tant?</P>
<P>Clementina took her mother a&s;ide, but &s;poke loud enough to be heard.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="305">
To be &s;ure, madam, that would have been wrong: But I am glad I was not refu&s;ed with contempt: That my tutor, and the pre&s;erver of my Jeronymo, did not <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> me. To &s;ay truth, I was afraid he liked Oli|via; and &s;o made a pretence.</P>
<P>Don't you think, my dear, that you would have run too great a hazard of your own &s;aith, had you complied with the Chevalier's propo&s;als?</P>
<P>Why no, &s;urely, madam!&mdash;Might I not have had as great a chance of converting him, as he could have had of perverting me? I glory in my Religion, madam.</P>
<P>So does he, my love, in his.</P>
<P>That is his <HI>fault,</HI> madam. Chevalier, &s;tepping towards me, I think you a very ob&s;tinate man. I hope you have not heard our di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Yes, my dear, he has: And I de&s;ire not but he &s;hould.</P>
<P>Would to God, madam, &s;aid I to the Marchione&s;s, that I had yours and my Lord's intere&s;t! From what the dear Lady Clementina has hinted, I might pre|&s;ume&mdash;</P>
<P>But, Sir, you are <HI>mi&s;taken,</HI> perhaps, &s;aid the young Lady. Tho' I an&s;wer for an&s;wering's &s;ake, and to &s;hew that I have no doubt of my &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in an article in which my &s;oul is concerned; yet that is no proof of my attachment to an ob&s;tinate&mdash;I know what!&mdash;Heretic was, no doubt, in her head.</P>
<P>I took her mother a&s;ide: For God's &s;ake, madam, encourage my pre&s;umptuous hopes. Do you not ob|&s;erve already, an alteration in the dear Lady's mind? Is &s;he not more unaffectedly &s;edate than &s;he was be|fore? Is not her mind quieter, now &s;he knows that every thing was yielded up that honour and con|&s;cience would permit to be yielded up? See that &s;weet &s;erenity almo&s;t re&s;tored to tho&s;e eyes, that within the&s;e few moments had a wilder turn!</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier! this depends not on me. And if it
<PB N="303" REF="306">
<HI>did,</HI> I cannot allow of my daughter's marrying a man &s;o bigotted to his errors. Excu&s;e me, Sir! But if you were more indifferent in your religion, I &s;hould have more hopes of you, and le&s;s objection.</P>
<P>If, madam, I <HI>could</HI> be indifferent in my religion, the temptation would have been too great to be re|&s;i&s;ted. Lady Clementina, and an alliance with &s;uch a family.&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah Chevalier! I can give you no hope.</P>
<P>Look at the &s;weet Lady, madam! Behold her, as now, perhaps, balancing in my favour! Think of what &s;he was, the joy of every heart; and what &s;he may be!

<P>The Marchione&s;s was retiring. I beg of you, madam, &s;aid I, to &s;lip unob&s;erved into that clo&s;et. You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> hear all that pa&s;&s;es. The occa&s;ion may be critical. Let me have the opportunity of being either approved or cen&s;ured, as I &s;hall appear to de&s;erve, in the conver&s;ation that may pa&s;s between the dear Lady and me, if you do withdraw.</P>
<P>O Chevalier! you are equally prudent and gene|rous! Why won't you be one of us? Why won't you be a Catholic?</P>
<P>She went out at the door. Clementina courte&s;ied to her. I led her eye from the door, and the Marchione&s;s re-entered, and &s;lipt into the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>I conducted the young Lady to a chair, which I placed with its back to the clo&s;et-door, that her mother
<PB N="307" REF="310">
might hear all that pa&s;&s;ed.&mdash;She &s;at down, and bid me &s;it by her.</P>
<P>I was wiling &s;he &s;hould lead the &s;ubject, that the Marchione&s;s might ob&s;erve I intended not to pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s her.</P>
<P>We were &s;ilent for a few moments. She &s;eemed perplexed; looked up, looked down; then on one &s;ide, then on the other&mdash;At la&s;t, O Chevalier! &s;aid &s;he, they were happy times when I was your pupil, and you were teaching me Engli&s;h!</P>
<P>They were <HI>indeed</HI> happy times, madam.</P>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont was too hard for me, Chevalier!&mdash;Do you know Mrs. Beaumont?</P>
<P>I do. She is one of the be&s;t of women.</P>
<P>Why &s;o I think. But &s;he turned and winded me about mo&s;t &s;trangely. I think I was in a great fault.</P>
<P>How &s;o, madam?&mdash;How &s;o! Why to let her get out of me a &s;ecret that I had kept from my mo|ther. And yet there never was a more indulgent mother.&mdash;Now you look, Chevalier: But I &s;ha'n't tell you what the &s;ecret was.</P>
<P>I do not a&s;k you, madam.</P>
<P>If you did, I would not tell you.&mdash;Well but I had a great deal to &s;ay to you, I thought. I wi&s;h that frantic Camilla had not &s;topt me when I was going to you. I had a great deal to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P>Cannot you recollect, madam, any part of it?</P>
<P>Let me con&s;ider&mdash;Why, in the fir&s;t place, I thought you <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> me, I was not &s;orry for that, I do a&s;&s;ure you: That did me good.

<P>The Marchione&s;s was too near for her&s;elf: She could not bear this &s;peech of her pious, generous, no|ble daughter. She &s;obbed; &s;he groaned.</P>
<P>Clementina &s;tarted&mdash;She looked at me. She looked round her. Whence came the&s;e groans? Did <HI>you</HI> groan, Sir?&mdash;You are not a hard-hearted man, tho' they &s;ay you are.

<P>What could I &s;ay to the dear Lady? Her mind was rai&s;ed above an earthly Love, Circum&s;tanced as we were, how could I expre&s;s the tenderne&s;s for her which overflowed my heart? Compa&s;&s;ion is a motive that a woman of &s;pirit will reject: And how could Love be here pleaded, when the parties believed it to be in my own power to exert it? Could I en|deavour to replace my&s;elf in her affection, when I refu&s;ed to comply with their terms, and they with mine? To have argued again&s;t her religion, and in defence of my own, her mind &s;o di&s;turbed, could not be done: And ought I, in genero&s;ity, in ju&s;tice to

her family, to have attempted to un&s;ettle her in a faith in which &s;he, and all her family, were &s;o well &s;ati&s;|fied?</P>
<P>I could only, when I could &s;peak, applaud her pi|ety, and pronounce her an Angel of a woman, an or|nament of her &s;ex, and an honour to her religion; and endeavour to wave the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Ah, Chevalier! &s;aid &s;he, after a &s;ilence of &s;ome minutes!&mdash;You are an ob&s;tinate man! Indeed you are&mdash;Yet, I think, you do not de&s;pi&s;e me.&mdash;But what &s;ays your paper?</P>
<P>She took it out of her bo&s;om, and read it. She &s;eemed affected by it, as if &s;he had not before con|&s;idered it: And you <HI>really</HI> propo&s;ed the&s;e terms, Sir? And would you have allowed me the full exerci&s;e of my religion; And &s;hould I have had my confe&s;&s;or? And would you have allowed me to convert you, if I could? And would you have treated my confe&s;&s;or kindly? And would you have been dutiful to my papa and mamma? And would you have loved my two other brothers as well as you do Jeronymo?&mdash;And would you have let me live at Bologna? You don't &s;ay, Yes.&mdash;But do you &s;ay, No?</P>
<P>To the&s;e terms, madam, mo&s;t willingly would I have &s;ub&s;cribed: And if, my deare&s;t Lady, they could have had the wi&s;hed-for effect, how happy had I been!</P>
<P>Well!&mdash;She then pau&s;ed; and re&s;uming, What &s;hall we &s;ay to all the&s;e things?</P>
<P>I thought her mother would take it well, to have an opportunity given her to quit the clo&s;et, now her Clementina had changed her &s;ubject to one &s;o con|cerning to the whole family. I favoured her doing &s;o. She &s;lipt out, her face bathed in tears, and &s;oon after came in at the drawing-room door.</P>
<P>Ah, madam; &s;aid Clementina, paying obei&s;ance to her, I have been arguing and pleading with the Chevalier.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="314">
Then, &s;peaking low, I believe he may, in time, be convinced: He has a tender heart. But hu&s;h, putting her finger to her mouth, and then &s;peaking louder. I have been reading this paper again&mdash;</P>
<P>She was going on too favourably for me, as it was evident the Marchione&s;s apprehended (the fir&s;t time that I had rea&s;on to think &s;he was di&s;inclined to the alliance): For &s;he &s;topt her: My Love, &s;aid &s;he, you and I will talk of this matter by our&s;elves.</P>
<P>She rang. Camilla came in. She made a motion for Camilla to attend her daughter, and withdrew, inviting me out with her.</P>
<P>When we were in another room, Ah, Chevalier &s;aid &s;he, How was it po&s;&s;ible that you could with|&s;tand &s;uch an heavenly pleader? You cannot love her as &s;he de&s;erves to be loved: You cannot but act nobly, generou&s;ly; but indeed you are an invincible man.</P>
<P>Not love her, madam!

<P><PB N="312" REF="315">
I believe it may as well be deferred, Chevalier.</P>

<P>Camilla ha&s;tened after me. Chevalier, &s;ays &s;he, my Lady a&s;ks, If you will not vi&s;it Signor Jero|nymo?</P>

<P>O Dr. Bartlett!&mdash;But the mother was right. She was to account for her conduct in the ab&s;ence of her Lord. She knew the determination of the family; and her Clementina was on the point of &s;hewing more favour to me, than, as things were circum&s;tanced, it was proper &s;he &s;hould &s;hew me: Yet they hand found out that Clementina, in the way &s;he was in, was not ea&s;ily diverted from any thing &s;he took &s;trongly into her head; and they never had accu&s;tomed her to con|tradiction.</P>
<P>Well, Lucy, now you have read this Letter, do you not own, that this man, and this woman, can only de&s;erve each other?&mdash;Your Harriet, my dear, is not worthy to be the handmaid of either.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s ninth Letter.</HEAD>
<P>THE young Lady, proceeds Mr. Grandi&s;on, af|ter I had left her, went to her brother Jerony|mo. There I &s;hould have found her, and I, as her mother motioned by Camilla, vi&s;ited my friend: But when I found he was likely to &s;tand alone in his favour to me; when the Marchione&s;s had &s;o unex|pectedly declared her&s;elf again&s;t the compromi&s;e; I was afraid of di&s;turbing his worthy heart, by the grief which at the in&s;tant overwhelmed mine.</P>
<P>The following particulars Jeronymo &s;ent me, with|in three hours after I left their palace.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter, making Camilla retire, &s;hewed him the paper which &s;he had written, and made me &s;ign, and a&s;ked him what he knew of the contents.</P>
<P>He knew not what had pa&s;&s;ed between his mother and me; nor did Clementina.</P>
<P>He told her, that I had actually made tho&s;e pro|po&s;als. He a&s;&s;ured her, that I loved her above all women. He acquainted her with my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>She pitied me. She thought, &s;he &s;aid, that I had not made any overtures, any conce&s;&s;ions; that I de|&s;pi&s;ed her; and &s;en&s;ibly a&s;ked, Why the Chevalier was &s;ent for from Vienna? We all knew his mind, as to religion, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>Then, after a pau&s;e, He never could have per|verted me, proceeded &s;he: He would have allowed me a confe&s;tor, would he not?</P>
<P>He would, an&s;wered Jeronymo&mdash;And he would have left me among my friends in Italy?&mdash;He would,
<PB N="314" REF="317">
replied he.&mdash;Well, brother, and I &s;hould have been glad perhaps to have &s;een England once; and he would perhaps have brought over his &s;i&s;ters and his father to vi&s;it us: And he prai&s;es them highly, <HI>you know.</HI> And if I were their &s;i&s;ter, I could have gone over with them, <HI>you know.</HI> Do you think, if I had loved <HI>them,</HI> they would not have loved <HI>me?</HI> I am not an ill-natured creature, <HI>you know;</HI> and they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be courteous: Are they not <HI>his</HI> &s;i&s;ters? And don't you think his father would love me? I &s;hould have brought no di&s;honour into his family, <HI>you know.</HI> &mdash;Well, but I'll tell you what, Jeronymo: He is really a tender-hearted man. I talked to him of his Soul; and, upon my honour, I believe I could have prevailed, in time. Father Mare&s;cotti is a &s;evere man, <HI>you know;</HI> and he has been always &s;o much con&s;ulted, and don't love the Chevalier, I believe: So that I fancy, if I were to have a venerable &s;weet-tempered man for my con|fe&s;&s;or, between <HI>my</HI> Love, and my <HI>confe&s;&s;or</HI>'s Pru|dence, we &s;hould gain a Soul.&mdash;Don't you think &s;o, Jeronymo?&mdash;And that &s;hould cover a great many &s;ins. And all his family might be converted too, <HI>you know!</HI></P>
<P>He encouraged her in this way of thinking. She believed, &s;he &s;aid, that I was not yet gone. He is <HI>&s;o</HI> tender-hearted, brother! <HI>that</HI> is my dependence: And you &s;ay, he loves me. Are you &s;ure of that?&mdash;But I have rea&s;on to think he does. He &s;hed tears, as I talked to him, more than once; while my eyes were as dry as they are now. I did not &s;hed one tear. Well, I'll go to him, and talk with him.</P>
<P>She went to the door; but came back on tiptoe; and in a whi&s;pering accent&mdash;My mamma is coming; Hu&s;h, Jeronymo! let Hu&s;h be the word!&mdash;</P>
<P>The door opened&mdash;Here, madam, is your girl!&mdash;But it is not my mamma: The impertinent Camilla. She follows me as my &s;hadow!</P>
<P>My Lady de&s;ires to &s;ee you, Lady Clementina, in her dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="318">
I obey. But where is the Chevalier?</P>
<P>Gone, madam. Gone &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Ah, brother! &s;aid &s;he, and her countenance fell.</P>
<P>What, gone! &s;aid Jeronymo, without &s;eeing me! Unkind Grandi&s;on! He did not u&s;e to be &s;o unkind.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the advices &s;ent me by my friend Jeronymo.</P>
<P>I acquainted him in return, by pen and ink, with all that had pa&s;&s;ed between the Marchione&s;s and me, that he might not, by his friend&s;hip for me, involve him&s;elf in difficulties.</P>
<P>In the morning I had a vi&s;it from Camilla, by her Lady's command; with excu&s;es for refu&s;ing to allow me to take leave of Clementina. She hoped I was not di&s;plea&s;ed with her on that account. It was the effect of prudence, and not di&s;re&s;pect. She &s;hould ever regard me, even in a tender manner, as if the de&s;ired relation could have taken place. Her Lord, and his brother the Conte della Porretta (as he is called) with the General and the Bi&s;hop, arrived the night before, accompanied by the Count's elde&s;t &s;on, Signor Seba&s;tiano. She had been much blamed for permitting the interview; but regretted it the le&s;s, as her beloved daughter was more compo&s;ed than before, and gave &s;edate an&s;wers to all the que&s;tions put to her. But, neverthele&s;s, &s;he wi&s;hed that I would retire from Bologna, for Clementina's &s;ake, as well as for my own.</P>
<P>Camilla added from Signor Jeronymo, that he wi&s;hed to hear from me from the Trentine, or Ve|nice: And as from her&s;elf, and in confidence, that her young Lady was greatly concerned, that I did not wait on her again before I went away: That &s;he fell into a &s;ilent fit upon it; and that her mamma, on her not an&s;wering to her que&s;tions, for the fir&s;t time, chid her: That this gave her great di&s;tre&s;s, but pro|duced what they had &s;o much wi&s;hed for, a flood of
<PB N="316" REF="319">
tears; and that now &s;he frequently wept, and la|mented to her, What &s;hould &s;he do? Her mamma did not love her; and her mamma talked again&s;t the Chevalier. She wi&s;hed to be allowed to &s;ee him. Nobody now would love her but the Chevalier and Jeronymo! It would be better for her to be in Eng|land, or any-where, that to be in the &s;weete&s;t country in the world, and hated.</P>
<P>Camilla told me, that the Marquis, the Count his brother, and the General, had indeed blamed the Marchione&s;s for permitting the interview; but were plea&s;ed that I was refu&s;ed taking leave of the young Lady, when &s;he &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to dwell on the con|tents of the note &s;he had made me &s;ign: They &s;eemed now all of a mind, &s;he &s;aid; That were I to comply with their terms, the alliance would not, by any means, be a proper one. Their rank, their degree, their alliances, were dwelt upon: I found that their advantages, in all the&s;e re&s;pects, were heightened, my degree, my con&s;equence, lowered, in order to make the difference greater, and the difficulties in|&s;uperable.</P>
<P>Clementina's uncle, and his elde&s;t &s;on, both men of &s;en&s;e and honour, who u&s;ed to be high in her e&s;teem, had talked to her, but could get nothing from her but No, and Yes. Her father had talked to her alone; but they melted each other, and nothing re|&s;ulted of comfort to either. Her mother joined him, but &s;he threw her&s;elf at her mother's feet, be&s;ought her to forgive her, and not to <HI>chide her again.</HI> They had intended to di&s;courage her from thinking of me upon any terms. The General and the Bi&s;hop were to talk to her that morning. They had expre&s;&s;ed di&s;|plea&s;ure at Signor Jeronymo, for his continued warmth in my favour. Father Mare&s;cotti was now con&s;ulted as an oracle: And I found, that, by an indelicacy of thinking, he imagined, that the hu&s;band would &s;et all right; and was for encouraging the Count of Belve|dere, and getting me at di&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="320">
Camilla obligingly offered to acquaint me, from time to time, with what occurred; but I thought it was not right to accept of a &s;ervant's intelligence out of the family &s;he belonged to, unle&s;s &s;ome one of it authorized her to give it me. Yet, you mu&s;t believe, I wanted not anxious curio&s;ity on a &s;ubject &s;o inte|re&s;ting. I thanked her; but &s;aid, that it might, if di&s;covered, lay her under inconveniencies which would grieve me for her &s;ake. She had the good &s;en&s;e to approve of my declining her offer.</P>
<P>In the morning of the &s;ame day, I had a vi&s;it made me which I little expected: It was from Father Ma|re&s;cotti. It is a common thing to load an enemy, e&s;|pecially if he be in Holy Orders, and comes to us in the gui&s;e of friend&s;hip, with the charge of hypocri&s;y: But partiality may be at the bottom of the accu&s;a|tion. Father Mare&s;cotti is a zealous Roman Catho|lic: I could not hope either for his intere&s;t, or affec|tion: He could not but wi&s;h to fru&s;trate my hopes. As a man in earne&s;t in his own principles, and who knew how &s;tedfa&s;t I was in mine, it was his duty to oppo&s;e this alliance. He is, perhaps, the hone&s;t man for knowing but little of human nature, and of the tender pa&s;&s;ions. As to that of Love, he &s;eemed to have drawn his conclu&s;ions from general ob&s;ervations: He knew not how to allow for particular con&s;titu|tions, nor to account for the delicacy of &s;uch a heart as Clementina's. He thought that Love was always a poor blind boy, led in a &s;tring, either by Folly, or Fancy; and that once the impetus got over, and the Lady &s;ettled into the common offices of life, &s;he would dome&s;ticate her&s;elf, and be as happy with a Count of Belvedere, e&s;pecially as he is a very worthy man, as if &s;he had married the man once mo&s;t favoured. On this pre&s;umption, it was a conde&s;cen&s;ion, in &s;uch a man, to come to me, and to declare him&s;elf my friend; and advi&s;e me what to do for promoting the peace of a family which I profe&s;&s;ed to venerate: and
<PB N="318" REF="321">
hear that his conde&s;cen&s;ion was owing to a real great|ne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>I was, from the moment of his entrance, very open, very frank; more &s;o than he expected, as he owned. He told me, that he was afraid I had con|ceived prejudices again&s;t him. The kinder then in him, I &s;aid, that he conde&s;cended to make me &s;o friendly a vi&s;it. I a&s;&s;ured him, that I regarded him as a good man. I had indeed &s;ometimes thought him &s;evere; but that convinced me that he was very much in earne&s;t in his religion. I was &s;en&s;ible, I &s;aid, that we ought always to look to the intention: To put our&s;elves in the &s;ituation of the per&s;ons of who&s;e actions we pre&s;umed to judge; and even to think well of au&s;terities, which had their foundation in vir|tue, in whatever manner they affected us.</P>
<P>He applauded me; and &s;aid, That I wanted &s;o little to be a Catholic, that it was a thou&s;and pities I was not one: And he was per&s;uaded, that I &s;hould one day be a pro&s;elyte.</P>
<P>This Father's bu&s;ine&s;s was, to convince me of the unfitne&s;s of an alliance between families &s;o very op|po&s;ite in their religious &s;entiments. He went into hi|&s;tory upon it. You may believe, that the unhappy con&s;equences which follow the marriage between our Charles I. and the Prince&s;s Henrietta of France, were not forgotten. He expatiated upon them; but I ob&s;erved to him, That the Monarch was the &s;ufferer, by the zeal of the Queen for her religion, and not the Queen, any otherwi&s;e than as &s;he was involved in the con&s;equences of tho&s;e &s;ufferings which &s;he had brought upon him. In &s;hort, Father, &s;aid I, We Prote&s;tants, &s;ome of us, have zeal; but let us alone, and it is not a per&s;ecuting one. Your doctrine of <HI>me|rits</HI> makes the zeal of your devotees altogether active, and perhaps the more flaming, in proportion as the per&s;on is more hone&s;t and worthy.</P>
<P>I lamented, that I was &s;ent for from Vienna, upon
<PB N="319" REF="322">
hopes, tho' my principles were well known, that o|therwi&s;e I had never pre&s;umed to entertain.</P>
<P>He owned that that was a wrong &s;tep, and valued him&s;elf that he had not been con&s;ulted upon it: And that when he knew it had been taken, he inveighed again&s;t it.</P>
<P>And I am <HI>afraid,</HI> Father, &s;aid I&mdash;</P>
<P>He interrupted me&mdash;Why, I believe &s;o!&mdash;You have made &s;uch generous di&s;tinctions in favour of the duty of a man acting in my function, that, I mu&s;t own, I have not been an idle ob&s;erver on this occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>He advi&s;ed me to quit Bologna. He was profu&s;e in his offers of &s;ervice in any other affair; and, I dare &s;ay, was in earne&s;t.</P>
<P>I told him, That I cho&s;e not to leave it precipi|tately, and as if I had done &s;omething blame-worthy. I had &s;ome hopes of being recalled to my father's arms. I &s;hould &s;et out, when I left Bologna, directly for Paris, to be in the way of &s;uch a long-wi&s;hed for call; and then, &s;aid I, Adieu to travelling! Adieu to Italy, for ever! I &s;hould have been happy, had I never &s;een it, but in the way for which I have been accu|&s;tomed to cen&s;ure the generality of my countrymen.</P>
<P>His behaviour at parting was &s;uch, as will make me for ever revere him; and will <HI>enlarge</HI> a charity for all good men of his religion; which yet, before, was not a narrow one. For, begging my excu&s;e, he kneeled down at the door of my antechamber, and offered up, in a very &s;ervent manner, a prayer for my conver&s;ion. He could not have given me, any other way, &s;o high an opinion of him: No, not, had he offered me his intere&s;t with Clementina, and her fa|mily. I embraced him, as he did me: Tears were in his eyes. I thanked him for the favour of this vi&s;it; and, recommending my&s;elf to his frequent pray|ers, told him, That he might be a&s;&s;ured of all the re|&s;pectful &s;ervices he &s;hould put it in my power to ren|der

him. I longed, Dr. Bartlett, to make him a pre&s;ent worthy of his acceptance, had I known what would have been acceptable, and had I not been afraid of affronting him. I accompanied him to the outward door. I never, &s;aid he, &s;aw a Prote&s;tant that I loved, before. Your mind is &s;till more amiable than your per&s;on. Lady Clementina, I &s;ee, might have been happy with you: But it was not fit, on <HI>our</HI> &s;ide. He &s;natched my hand, before I was aware, and honoured it with his lips, and ha&s;tened from me, leaving me at a lo&s;s, and looking after him, and for him, when he was out of &s;ight; my mind labouring as under a high &s;en&s;e of obligation to his goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Religion and Love, Dr. Bartlett, which heighten our reli&s;h for the things of both worlds, What pity is it, that they &s;hould ever run the human heart either into enthu&s;ia&s;m, or &s;uper&s;tition; and thereby deba&s;e the minds they are both &s;o well fitted to exalt!</P>
<P>I am equally &s;urpri&s;ed and affected by the contents of the following Letter, directed to me. It was put within the door; nobody &s;aw by whom. The daugh|ter of the Lady at who&s;e hou&s;e I lodge, found it, and gave it to one of my &s;ervants for me.</P>
<P>DON'T be &s;urpri&s;ed, Chevalier: don't think a|mi&s;s of me for my forwardne&s;s. I heard &s;ome words drop (&s;o did Camilla, but &s;he can't go out to tell you of them) as if &s;omebody's life was in danger. This di&s;tracts me. I am not treated as I was accu&s;|tomed to be treated. They don't love me now&mdash;They don't love their poor Clementina! Very true, Chevalier! You, who were always telling me how dearly they all loved me, will hardly believe it, I &s;uppo&s;e. Nothing now is &s;aid, but <HI>You &s;hall, Cle|mentina</HI> &mdash;from tho&s;e who u&s;ed to call me Si&s;ter, and dear Si&s;ter, at every word.</P>
<P>They &s;aid, I was well, and quite well, and ought to be treated with a high hand&mdash;I know from whom

they have that. From my&s;elf. I &s;aid &s;o to Mrs. Beaumont; but &s;he need not to have told <HI>them.</HI> I won't go to her again, for that. They &s;ay I <HI>&s;hall.</HI> God help me, I don't know where to go for a quiet mind. A <HI>high hand</HI> won't do, Chevalier: I wi&s;h I knew what would; I would tell it to them. I once thought it would; el&s;e I had not &s;aid it to Mrs. Beaumont: But let them go on with their high hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, with all my heart: That heart will not hold always. It had been gone before now, had not Mrs. Beau|mont got out of me&mdash;Something&mdash;I won't tell you what&mdash;And then they &s;ent for Somebody&mdash;And Some|body came&mdash;And what then?&mdash;They need not threaten me &s;o&mdash;Somebody is not &s;o much to blame as they will have it he is: And that Somebody did make propo&s;als&mdash;Did you not, Chevalier?&mdash;I had like to have betrayed my&s;elf&mdash;I &s;topt ju&s;t in time.</P>
<P>But, Chevalier, I'll tell you a &s;ecret&mdash;Don't &s;peak of it to any-body&mdash;May I depend upon you?&mdash;I know I may. Why, Camilla tells me, that the Count of Belvedere is to come again&mdash;Are you not &s;orry for your poor pupil? But I'll tell you another &s;ecret&mdash;And that is, what I intend to &s;ay to him&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Look you here, my Lord, you are a very good &s;ort of a man; and you have great e&s;tates: You are very rich: You are, in &s;hort, a very good &s;ort of man; but there is, however, a man in the world with whom I had rather live in the poore&s;t hermitage in a wilder|ne&s;s, than with you in the riche&s;t palace in the world.'</Q> After this, if he be not the creeping mean man you &s;aid he was not, he will be an&s;wered&mdash;Every-thing you &s;aid to me in former happy times, I rememher.

But this, you know, will be a &s;uffi|cient an&s;wer to the Count of Belvedere. Don't you think &s;o?</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="325">
Here I have been tormented again!&mdash;Would you think it? I have been pleading for &s;omebody, boldly, confidently. I &s;aid I could depend upon his honour! Ah, Chevalier!

They will quite harden me.</P>
<P>But ju&s;t now my mamma, O &s;he is the be&s;t of mothers!&mdash;My mamma tells me, She will not per&s;uade me, if I will be patient, if I will be good. My dear mamma, as I told her, I will be patient, and good: But don't let them inveigh again&s;t the Chevalier, then. What harm has he done?&mdash;Was he not&mdash;Ah! Sir, now I blu&s;h!&mdash;Was he not &s;ent for?&mdash;And did he not weep over me&mdash;Yet none of your bold men, who look as proudly as if they were &s;ure of your ap|probation!&mdash;Well, but what do you think my mamma &s;aid&mdash;Ah, Clementina! &s;aid &s;he, would to God the Chevalier for <HI>his own &s;ake</HI> (yes, &s;he &s;aid for <HI>his own &s;ake;</HI> and that made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon me; it was &s;o good, you know, of my mamma) that the Chevalier was in England, or a thou&s;and miles off. So, Sir, this is my advice&mdash;Pray take it; for I and Camilla heard &s;ome words, and Camilla, as, well as I, is much troubled about them&mdash;Get away to England as &s;oon as you can&mdash;Be &s;ure do!&mdash;And &s;ome months hence, bring your two &s;i&s;ters over with you; and by that time all our feuds will be over, you know: And you &s;hall take a hou&s;e, and then I can go and vi&s;it your &s;i&s;ters, you know, and your &s;i&s;ters will vi&s;it us. You will come &s;ometimes with them; Won't you? Well, and I'll tell you how we will pa&s;s part of our time: They &s;hall perfect me in my Engli&s;h: I will perfect them in Italian. They know as much of that, I &s;uppo&s;e, at lea&s;t, as I do of Eng|li&s;h: And we will vi&s;it every court, and every city.
<PB N="323" REF="326">
So, God ble&s;s you, Sir, and get away, as &s;oon as you can. I put no name; for fear this &s;hould mi&s;carry, and I &s;hould be found out&mdash;Ah, Sir! they are very &s;evere with me! Pity me: But I know you will; for you have a tender heart. <HI>It is all for you!</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t five words were intended to be &s;cratched out; and are but ju&s;t legible.</P>
<P>How the contents of this Letter afflict me! Words cannot expre&s;s what I feel! I &s;ee, evidently, that they are taking wrong mea&s;ures with the tendere&s;t heart in the world; a heart that never once has &s;werved from its duty; and which is filled with reverence and love for all that boa&s;t a relation to it. Har&s;h treatment, and which is be&s;ides <HI>new</HI> to it, is <HI>not</HI> the method to be taken with &s;uch a heart. Shall I, thought I, when I had peru&s;ed it, a&s;k for an audience of a mother &s;o indulgent, and give her my di&s;intere&s;ted advice upon it? Once I could have done &s;o; and even, in con|fidence, have &s;hewn her this very Letter: But now &s;he is one with the angry part of her family, and I dare not do it&punc; for Clementina's &s;ake. Talk of lock|ing her up! Talk of bringing a Lover to her!&mdash;<HI>Threatening</HI> her with going to Mrs. Beaumont, when they &s;hould <HI>court</HI> her to go thither! Not &s;uffer her to &s;ee her beloved Jeronymo!&mdash;<HI>He</HI> in di&s;grace too&mdash;How hard, how wrong, is all this conduct! I could have written to Jeronymo, thought I, and advi&s;ed gentle mea&s;ures, were he not out of their con ulta|tions&mdash;As to the threatened <HI>re&s;entments,</HI> they are as nothing to me. Clementina's &s;ufferings are every|thing! My &s;oul di&s;dains the thought of fa&s;tening my|&s;elf upon a proud family, that now looks upon me in a mean light. A proud heart undervalued, will &s;well. It will be put upon <HI>over</HI> -valuing it&s;elf. You know, Dr. Bartlett, that I have a <HI>very</HI> proud heart: But when I am trampled upon, or de&s;pi&s;ed, <HI>then</HI> is it mo&s;t proud. I would call my&s;elf a <HI>Man,</HI> to a Prince, who
<PB N="324" REF="327">
&s;hould unju&s;tly hold me in contempt; and let him know that I looked upon <HI>him</HI> to be no more. My pride is rai&s;ed: Yet again&s;t whom? Not Clementina! She has all my pity! She has &s;een, and I have found, that her unhappy delirium, tho' not cau&s;ed by me (I ble&s;s God for that!) has made me tender as a chidden infant. And can I think of quitting Bologna, and not &s;ee if it be po&s;&s;ible for me to gratify my&s;elf, and &s;erve them in her re&s;toration? Setting quite out of the que&s;tion the General's cau&s;ele&s;s re&s;entments, and the engagement I have laid my&s;elf under not to leave it, without apprizing him of my intention.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I re&s;olved to wait the i&s;&s;ue of the new mea&s;ures they have fallen upon. The dear Lady has declared her&s;elf in my favour. Such a frank de|claration mu&s;t &s;oon be followed by important con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>THE third day after the arrival of her father and brothers from Urbino, I received the following Billet from the Marquis him&s;elf:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Chevalier</HI> Grandi&s;on,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. We cannot take upon us to forbid your &s;tay at Bologna; but &s;hall be obliged to you, if you will enable us to ac|quaint our daughter, that you are gone to England, or &s;ome far di&s;tant part. Wi&s;hing you happy, I am, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient humble &s;ervant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>To this I wrote as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am exce&s;&s;ively grieved for your di&s;tre&s;s. I make no he&s;itation to obey you. But as I am not con|&s;cious of having, in word or deed, offended you, or any one of a family to whom I owe infinite obliga|tions;

let me hope, that I may be allowed a farewel vi&s;it to your Lord&s;hip, to your Lady, and to your three &s;ons; that my departure may not appear like that of a criminal, in&s;tead of the parting that, from the knowledge I have of my own heart, as well as of your experienced goodne&s;s, may be claimed by your Lord&s;hip's</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Ever obliged, and affectionate humble Servant,</HI> 
GRANDISON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This reque&s;t, I under&s;tood, occa&s;ioned warm de|bates. It was &s;aid to be a very bold one: But my dear Jeronymo in&s;i&s;ted, that it was worthy of his Friend, his Deliverer, as he called me; and of an in|nocent man.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult was, that I &s;hould be invited in form, to vi&s;it and take leave of the family: And two days were taken, that &s;ome others of the Urbino family might be pre&s;ent, to &s;ee a man, for the la&s;t time (and &s;ome of them for the fir&s;t), who was thought, by his reque&s;t, to have &s;hewn a very extraordinary degree of intrepidity; and who, tho' a Prote&s;tant, was honoured with &s;o great an intere&s;t in the heart of their Clemen|tina.</P>
<P>The day before I was to make this formal vi&s;it (for &s;uch it was to be) I received the following Letter from my friend Jeronymo:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My deare&s;t <HI>Grandi&s;on,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TAKE the particulars of the &s;ituation we are in here, that you may know what to expect&punc; and how to act and comport your&s;elf, to-morrow evening.</P>
<P>Your reception will be, I am afraid, cold; but civil.</P>
<P>You will be looked upon by the Urbino family, who have heard more of you than they have &s;een, as a curio&s;ity; but with more wonder than affection.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="329">
Of them will be pre&s;ent, the Count my father's brother, and his &s;ons Seba&s;tiano and Juliano, my aunt Signora Juliana de Storza, a widow Lady, as you know, and her daughter Signora Laurana, a young woman of my &s;i&s;ter's age, between whom and my &s;i&s;ter u&s;ed to be, as you have heard, the &s;tricte&s;t friend|&s;hip and corre&s;pondence; and who in&s;i&s;ted on being pre&s;ent on this occa&s;ion. They are all good-natured people; but love not either your country or religion.</P>
<P>Father Mare&s;cotti will be pre&s;ent. He is become your very great admirer.</P>
<P>My father thinks to make you his compliments; but if he withdraws the moment he has made them, you mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed.</P>
<P>My mother &s;ays, that as it is the la&s;t time that &s;he may ever &s;ee you, and as &s;he really greatly re&s;pects you, &s;he &s;hall not be able to leave you while you &s;tay.</P>
<P>The General, I hope, will behave with politene&s;s.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop loves you; but will not however, per|haps, be in high good humour with you.</P>
<P>Your Jeronymo will be wheeled into the &s;ame room. If he be more &s;ilent than u&s;ual on the &s;olemn occa&s;ion, you will not do him inju&s;tice, perhaps, if you attribute it to his prudence; but much more to his grief.</P>
<P>And now let me tell you, as briefly as I can, the &s;ituation of the dear creature who mu&s;t not appear, but who is more intere&s;ted in the occa&s;ion of the con|gre&s;s than any per&s;on who will be pre&s;ent at it.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed between you and her at the la&s;t inter|view, has greatly impre&s;&s;ed her in your favour. The Bi&s;hop, the General, and my Father, &s;oon after their return from Urbino, made her a vi&s;it in her dre&s;&s;ing|room. They talked to her of the excellency of her own Religion, and of the errors of the pretended Re|formed, which they called, and I <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> are, <HI>damn|able.</HI> They found her &s;teady in her abhorrence of
<PB N="327" REF="330">
the one, and adherence to the other. They were de|lighted with her rational an&s;wers, and compo&s;ed be|haviour: They all three retired in raptures, to con|gratulate each other upon it; and returned with plea|&s;ure, to enter into farther talk with her: But when they mentioned you to her, &s;he, led by their affection|ate behaviour to her on their return, &s;aid, It had given her great plea&s;ure, and ea&s;e of mind, to find that &s;he was not <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed</HI> by a man whom every one of the fa|mily regarded for his merit and great qualities. The General had hardly patience; he walked to the far|ther end of the room: My Father was in tears: The Bi&s;hop &s;oothed her, in order to induce her to &s;peak her whole mind.</P>
<P>He prai&s;ed you. She &s;eemed plea&s;ed. He led her to believe, that the whole family were willing to oblige her, if &s;he would declare her&s;elf; and a&s;ked her que&s;tions, the an&s;wers to which mu&s;t either be an avowal or a denial of her Love; and then &s;he owned, That &s;he preferred the Chevalier Grandi&s;on to all the men in the world; &s;he would not, again&s;t the opinion of her friends, wi&s;h to be his; but never would be the wife of any other man.</P>
<P>What, &s;aid the General, tho' he continue an He|retic?</P>
<P>He might be converted, &s;he &s;aid. And he was a &s;weet-tempered and compa&s;&s;ionate man: And a man of &s;en&s;e, as <HI>he</HI> was&punc; mu&s;t &s;ee his errors.</P>
<P>Would &s;he run the ri&s;que of her own &s;alvation?</P>
<P>She was &s;ure &s;he &s;hould never give up her faith.</P>
<P>It was tempting God to abandon her to her own perver&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Her reliance on his goodne&s;s to enable her to be &s;tedfa&s;t, was humble, and not pre&s;umptuous, and with a pious view to gain a pro&s;elyte; and God would not for&s;ake a per&s;on &s;o well intending. Was &s;he not to be allowed her confe&s;&s;or? Her confe&s;&s;or &s;hould be ap|pointed by them&s;elves, She did not doubt but the Chevalier would con&s;ent to that.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="331">
The Bi&s;hop, you know, can he cool when he plea&s;es. He bore to talk farther with her.</P>
<P>My father was &s;till in tears.</P>
<P>The General had no farther patience. He with|drew, and came to me, and vented on me his di&s;|plea&s;ure. It is true Grandi&s;on, when it was pro|po&s;ed to &s;end for you from Vienna, I, &s;anguine in my hopes, had expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf as void of all doubt but you would become a Catholic&mdash;Your love, your com|pa&s;&s;ion, your honour as I thought, engaged by &s;uch a &s;tep taken on our &s;ide&mdash;I had no notion that on &s;uch a &s;urprize, with &s;uch motives to urge your com|pliance, a young man like my&s;elf, and with a heart &s;o &s;en&s;ible, could have been &s;o firm: But the&s;e thoughts are all over&mdash;This, however, expo&s;es me to the more reproaches.</P>
<P>We were high; and my mother and uncle came in to mediate between us.</P>
<P>I would not, I could not, renounce my friend; the friend of my &s;oul, as in our fir&s;t acquaintance; and the pre&s;erver of my life.&mdash;Mi&s;erable as that has been, the pre&s;erver of it, at a time when I was en|gaged in an <HI>unlawful</HI> pur&s;uit, in which I had peri&s;hed, what might I have now been, and where?</P>
<P>I ventured to give my opinion in favour of my &s;i&s;ter's marriage with you, as the only method that could be taken to re&s;tore her; who, I &s;aid, loved you becau&s;e you were a virtuous man; and that her Love was not only founded in virtue, but was Virtue it&s;elf.</P>
<P>My brother told me, that I was as much be&s;ide my|&s;elf with my notions of gratitude, as my &s;i&s;ter was with a pa&s;&s;ion le&s;s excu&s;able.</P>
<P>I bid him forbear wounding a wounded man.</P>
<P>Thus high, ran words between u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop, mean time, went on with a true Church &s;ubtlety, to get out of the innocent girl her whole mind.</P>
<P>He boa&s;ted afterwards of his art. But what was
<PB N="329" REF="332">
there in it to boa&s;t of? A mind &s;o pure and &s;o &s;imple as Clementina's ever was, and which only the pride of her Sex, and motives of Religion, had perhaps hindered her from declaring to all the world.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked her, If &s;he was willing to leave her father, mother, brothers, and country, to go to a &s;trange land; to live among a hated People?</P>
<P>No, &s;he &s;aid; you would not wi&s;h her to go out of Italy. You would live nine months out of twelve in Italy.</P>
<P>He told her, That &s;he mu&s;t, when married, do as her husband would have her.</P>
<P>She could tru&s;t to your honour.</P>
<P>Would &s;he con&s;ent that her children &s;hould be trained up Heretics?</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent to this que&s;tion. He repeated it.</P>
<P>Well, my Lord, if I mu&s;t not be allowed to choo&s;e for my&s;elf; only let me not hear the Chevalier &s;poken of di&s;re&s;pectfully: He does not de&s;erve it. He has acted by me with as much honour, as he did by my brother. He is an uniformly good man, and as generous as good&mdash;And don't let me have <HI>other</HI> pro|po&s;als made me; and I will be contented. I had ne|ver &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed him, if every-body had not as well as I.</P>
<P>He was plea&s;ed to find her an&s;wers &s;o rational: He pronounced her quite well; and gave it as his opi|nion that you &s;hould be de&s;ired to quit Bologna: And your ab&s;ence, and a little time, he was &s;ure, would &s;ecure her health of mind.</P>
<P>But when her aunt Sforza and her cou&s;in Laurana talked with her next morning, they found her, on putting que&s;tions about you, ab&s;olutely determined in your favour.</P>
<P>She an&s;wered the objections they made again&s;t you, with equal warmth and clearne&s;s. She &s;eemed &s;en|&s;ible of the unhappy way &s;he had been in, and would have it, that the la&s;t interview &s;he had with you, had
<PB N="330" REF="333">
helped to calm and re&s;tore her: And &s;he hoped that &s;he &s;hould be better every day. She prai&s;ed your be|haviour to her: She expatiated upon, and pitied, your di&s;tre&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>They let her run on till they too had obtained from her a confirmation of all that the Bi&s;hop had reported; and, upon repeating the conver&s;ation, would have it, upon experience, that &s;oothing &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion was not the way to be taken; but that a high hand was to be u&s;ed, and that &s;he was to be &s;hamed out of a Love &s;o improper, &s;o irreligious, &s;o <HI>&s;candalous,</HI> to be encou|raged in a daughter of their hou&s;e with an Heretic; and who had &s;hewn him&s;elf to be a determined one.</P>
<P>They accordingly entered upon their new mea&s;ures. They forbad her to think of you: They told her, That &s;he &s;hould not upon any terms be yours; not now, even if you would change your religion for her. They depreciated your family, your fortune, and even your under&s;tanding; and brought to prove what they &s;aid again&s;t the latter&punc; your ob&s;tinate adherence to your <HI>mu&s;hroom</HI> religion, &s;o they called it; a religion that was founded in the wickedne&s;s of your VIIIth Henry; in the &s;uper&s;tition of a child his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and in the arts of a vile woman who had martyred a Si&s;ter Queen, a better woman than her&s;elf. They in&s;i&s;ted upon her encouraging the Count of Belvedere's addre&s;&s;es, as a mark of her obedience,</P>
<P>They condemned, in terms wounding to her mo|de&s;ty; her pa&s;&s;ion for a foreigner, an enemy to her &s;aith; and on her earne&s;t reque&s;t to &s;ee her father, he was prevailed upon to refu&s;e her that favour.</P>
<P>Lady Juliana Sforza and her daughter Laurana, the companion of her better hours, never &s;ee her, but they inveigh again&s;t you as an artful, an intere&s;ted man.</P>
<P>Her uncle treats her with authority; Signor Seba|&s;tiano with a pity bordering on contempt.</P>
<P>My mother &s;huns her; and indeed avoids me; But
<PB N="331" REF="334">
as &s;he has been blamed for permitting the interview, which they &s;uppo&s;e the wronge&s;t &s;tep that could have been taken; &s;he declares her&s;elf neutral, and re&s;igns to whatever will be done by her Lord, by his brother, her two &s;ons, and Ludy Juliana de Sforza: But I am &s;ure, in her heart, that &s;he approves not of the new mea&s;ures; and which al&s;o, as I have reminded the Bi&s;hop, &s;o contrary to the advice of the worthy Mrs. Beaumont; to whom they began to think of once more &s;ending my &s;i&s;ter, or of prevailing on her to come hither: But Clementina &s;eems not to be de&s;irous of going again to her; we know not why; &s;ince &s;he u&s;ed to &s;peak of her with the highe&s;t re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The dear &s;oul ru&s;ned in to me ye&s;terday. Ah, my Jeronymo! &s;aid &s;he, they will drive me into de&s;pair. They hate me, Jeronymo: But I have written to Somebody!&mdash;Hu&s;h! for your life, hu&s;h.</P>
<P>She was immediately followed in by her aunt Sforza and her cou&s;in Laurana, and the General; who, however, heard not what &s;he &s;aid, but in&s;i&s;ted on her returning to her own apartment.</P>
<P>What! &s;aid &s;he, Mu&s;t I not &s;peak to Jeronymo? Ah, Jeronymo!&mdash;I had a great deal to &s;ay to you!</P>
<P>I raved; but they hurried her out, and have forbid her to vi&s;it me: They, however, have had the civili|ty to de&s;ire my excu&s;e. They are &s;ure, they &s;ay, they are in the right way: And if I will have patience with them for a week, they will change their mea|&s;ures, if they find their new ones ineffectual. But my &s;i&s;ter will be lo&s;t, irrecoverably lo&s;t; I fore&s;ee that.</P>
<P>Ah Grandi&s;on! And can you &s;till&mdash;But now they will not accept of your change of religion. Poor Clementina! Unhappy Jeronymo! Unhappy <HI>Gran|di&s;on!</HI> I will &s;ay. If you are not &s;o, you cannot de|&s;erve the affection of a Clementina!</P>
<P>But are <HI>you</HI> the Somebody to whom &s;he has written? <HI>Has</HI> &s;he written to you? Perhaps you will
<PB N="332" REF="335">
find &s;ome opportunity to morrow to let me know whether &s;he has, or not. Camilla is forbidden to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e, or to write.</P>
<P>The General told me, ju&s;t now, that my gratitude to you. &s;hewed neither more or le&s;s, then the high value I put upon my own life.</P>
<P>I an&s;wered; That his ob&s;ervation <HI>convinced</HI> me, that he put a much le&s;s upon mine, than I, in the &s;ame ca&s;e &s;hould have upon his.</P>
<P>He reconciled him&s;elf to me by an endearment. He embraced me. Don't &s;ay <HI>convinced,</HI> Jeronymo. I love not my&s;elf better than I love my Jeronymo.</P>
<P>What can one do with &s;uch a man? He <HI>does</HI> love me.</P>
<P>My mother, as I &s;aid, is re&s;olved to be neutral: But, it &s;eems, &s;he is always in tears.</P>
<P>MY mother &s;tept in ju&s;t now&mdash;To my que&s;tion after my &s;i&s;ter's health; Ah, Jeronymo! &s;aid &s;he, All is wrong! The dear creature has been bad ever &s;ince ye&s;terday.

<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s tenth Letter.</HEAD>
<P>THE next day, (proceeds my patron) I went to make my vi&s;it to the family. I had nothing to reproach my&s;elf with, and therefore had no other con|cern upon me but what aro&s;e from the unhappine&s;s of the noble Clementina: That indeed was enough. I thought I &s;hould have &s;ome difficulty to manage my own &s;pirit, if I were to find my&s;elf in&s;ulted, e&s;pecially by the General. Soldiers are &s;o apt to value them&s;elves on their knowlege of what, after all, one may call but their trade, that a private gentle|man is often thought too &s;lightly of by them. In&s;o|lence in a great man, a rich man, or a &s;oldier, is a <HI>call</HI> upon a man of &s;pirit to exert him&s;elf. But I hope, thought I, I &s;hall not have this call from any one of a family I &s;o greatly re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I was received by the Bi&s;hop; who politely, after I had paid my compliments to the Marquis and his Lady, pre&s;ented me to tho&s;e of the Urbino family to whom I was a &s;tranger. Every one of tho&s;e named by Signor Jeronymo, in his la&s;t Letter, was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Marquis, after he had returned my compli|ment, looked another way, to hide his emetion: The Marchione&s;s put her handkerchief to her eyes, and looked upon me with tenderne&s;s; and I read in them her concern for her Clementina.</P>
<P>I paid my re&s;pects to the General with an air of freedom, yet of regard; to my Jeronymo, with the tenderne&s;s due to our friend&s;hip, and congratulated
<PB N="334" REF="337">
him on &s;eeing him out of his chamber. His kind eyes gli&s;tened with plea&s;ure; yet it was ea&s;y to read a mixture of pain in them; which grew &s;tronger as the fir&s;t emotions at &s;eeing me enter, gave way to re|flection.</P>
<P>The Conte della Porretta &s;eemed to mea&s;ure me with his eye.</P>
<P>I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to Father Mare&s;cotti, and made my particular acknowlegements to him for the favour of his vi&s;it, and what had pa&s;&s;ed in it. He looked upon me with plea&s;ure; probably with the more, as this was a farewel vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The two Ladies whi&s;pered, and looked upon me, and &s;eemed to be&s;peak each other's attention to what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Signor Seba&s;tiano placed him&s;elf next to Jeronymo, and often whi&s;pered him, and as often ca&s;t his eye upon me. He was partial to me, I believe, becau&s;e my generous friend &s;eemed plea&s;ed with what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>His brother, Signor Juliano, &s;at on the other hand of me. They are agreeable and polite young gen|tlemen.</P>
<P>A profound &s;ilence &s;ucceeded the general compli|ments.</P>
<P>I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the Marquis: Your Lord&s;hip, and you, madam, turning to the Marchione&s;s, I hope will excu&s;e me for having reque&s;ted of you the ho|nour of being once more admitted to your pre&s;ence, and to that of three brothers, for whom I &s;hall ever retain the highe&s;t veneration and re&s;pect. I could not think of leaving a city, where one of the fir&s;t fa|milies in it has done me the highe&s;t honour, without taking &s;uch a leave as might &s;hew my gratitude.&mdash;Ac|cept, my Lords, bowing to each; Accept, madam, more profoundly bowing to the Marchione&s;s, my re|&s;pectful thanks for all your goodne&s;s to me. I &s;hall, to the end of my life, number mo&s;t of the days that I have pa&s;&s;ed at Bologna among its happie&s;t, even
<PB N="335" REF="338">
were the remainder to be as happy as man ever knew.</P>
<P>The Marquis &s;aid, We wi&s;h you, Chevalier, very happy; happier than&mdash;He &s;ighed, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>His Lady only bowed. Her face &s;poke di&s;tre&s;s. Her voice was lo&s;t in &s;ighs, tho' &s;he &s;truggled to &s;up|pre&s;s them.</P>
<P>Chevalier, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, with an air of &s;olemnity, you have given us many happy hours: For them we thank you. Jeronymo, for him&s;elf, will &s;ay more: He is the mo&s;t grateful of men. We thank you al&s;o for what you have done for him.</P>
<P>I cannot, &s;aid Jeronymo, expre&s;s &s;uitably my gra|titude: My prayers&punc; my vows, &s;hall follow you whi|ther&s;oever you go, be&s;t of friends, and be&s;t of men!</P>
<P>The general, with an air and a &s;mile that might have been di&s;pen&s;ed with, oddly &s;aid, High plea&s;ure and high pain are very near neighbours: They are often guilty of exce&s;&s;es, and then are apt to mi&s;take each other's hou&s;e. I am one of tho&s;e who think our whole hou&s;e obliged to the Chevalier for the &s;ea&s;ona|ble a&s;&s;i&s;tance he gave to our Jeronymo&punc; But&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear General, &s;aid Juliana, bear with an interrup|tion: The intent of this meeting is amicable. The Chevalier is a man of honour. Things may have fallen out unhappily; yet nobody to blame.</P>
<P>As to blame, or otherwi&s;e, &s;aid the Conte della Porretta, that is not now to be talked of; el&s;e, I <HI>know</HI> where it lies: In &s;hort, among our&s;elves. The Chevalier acted greatly by Signor Jeronymo: We were all obliged to him: But to let &s;uch a man as <HI>this</HI> have free admi&s;&s;ion to our daughter&mdash;She ought to have had no eyes.</P>
<P>Pray, my Lord, Pray, brother, &s;aid the Marquis, Are we not enough &s;ufferers?</P>
<P>The Chevalier, &s;aid the General, cannot but be gratified by &s;o high a compliment; and &s;miled indig|nantly.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="339">
My Lord, replied I to the General, you know very little of the man before you, if you don't believe him to be the mo&s;t afflicted man pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible! &s;aid the Marquis, with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s aro&s;e from her &s;eat, motioning to go; and turning round to the two Ladies, and the Count, I have re&s;igned my will to the will of you all, my deare&s;t friends, and &s;hall be permitted to with|draw. This te&s;timony, however, before I go, I cannot but bear: Where-ever the fault lay, it lay not with the Chevalier. He has, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t, acted with the nice&s;t honour. He is intitled to our re&s;pect. The unhappine&s;s lies no-where but in the difference of religion.</P>
<P>Well, and that now is ab&s;olutely out of the que|&s;tion, &s;aid the General: It is indeed, Chevalier.</P>
<P>I hope, my Lord, from a de&s;cendant of a family &s;o illu&s;trious, to find an equal exemption from wound|ing words, and wounding looks; and that, Sir, as well from your genero&s;ity, as from your <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>My looks give you offence, Chevalier!&mdash;Do they?</P>
<P>I attended to the Marchione&s;s. She came towards me. I aro&s;e, and re&s;pectfully took her hand.&mdash;Che|valier, &s;aid &s;he, I could not withdraw without bear|ing the te&s;timony I have borne to your merits. I wi&s;h you happy&mdash;God protect you, whither&s;oever you go. Adieu.</P>
<P>She wept. I bowed on her hand with profound re&s;pect. She retired with precipitation. It was with difficulty that I &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the ri&s;ing tear. I took my &s;eat.</P>
<P>I made no an&s;wer to the General's la&s;t que&s;tion, tho' it was &s;poken in &s;uch a way (I &s;aw by their eyes) as took every other per&s;on's notice.</P>
<P>Lady Sforza, when her &s;i&s;ter was retired, hinted, that the la&s;t interview between the young Lady and me was an unadvi&s;ed permi&s;&s;ion, tho' intended for the be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="340">
I then took upon me to defend that &s;tep. Lady Clementina, &s;aid I, had declared, That if &s;he were allowed to &s;peak her whole mind to me, &s;he &s;hould be ea&s;y. I had for &s;ome time given my&s;elf up to ab&s;olute de&s;pair. The Marchione&s;s intended not <HI>favour</HI> to me in allowing of the interview: It was the mo&s;t affect|ing one to me I had ever known. But let me &s;ay, That, far from having bad effects on the young Lady's mind, it had good ones. I hardly knew how to talk upon a &s;ubject &s;o very intere&s;ting to every one pre&s;ent, but not more &s;o to any one than to my&s;elf. I thought of avoiding it; and have been led into it, but did not lead. And &s;ince it is before us, let me recommend, as the mo&s;t effectual way to re&s;tore every one to peace and happine&s;s, <HI>gentle treatment.</HI> The mo&s;t gene|rous of human minds, the mo&s;t meek, the mo&s;t duti|ful, requires not har&s;h methods.&mdash;</P>
<P>How do you know, Sir, &s;aid the General, and looked at Jeronymo, the methods now taken&mdash;</P>
<P>And <HI>are</HI> they then har&s;h, my Lord? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>He was offended.</P>
<P>I had heard, proceeded I, that a change of mea|&s;ures was re&s;olved on. I knew thatthe treatment be|fore had been all gentle, conde&s;cending, indulgent. I received but ye&s;terday Letters from my father, &s;igni|fying his intention of &s;peedily recalling me to my na|tive country. I &s;hall &s;et out very &s;oon for Paris, where I hope to meet with his more direct commands for this long-de&s;ired end. What may be my de&s;tiny, I know not; but I &s;hall carry with me a heart bur|dened with the woes of this family; and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the beloved daughter of it. But let me be&s;peak you all, for your own &s;akes (Mine is out of the que&s;tion: I pre&s;ume not upon any hope on my own account) that you will treat this Angelic-minded Lady with ten|derne&s;s. I pretend to &s;ay, that I know that har&s;h or &s;evere methods will not do.</P>
<P>The General aro&s;e from his &s;eat, and, with a coun|tenance
<PB N="338" REF="341">
of fervor, next to fiercene&s;s&mdash;Let me tell you, Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he&mdash;</P>
<P>I aro&s;e from mine, and going to Lady Sforza who &s;at next him, he &s;topt, &s;uppo&s;ing me going to him, and &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed, and attentive to my motions: But, di&s;regarding him, I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to that Lady. You, madam, are the aunt of Lady Clementina: The tender, the indulgent mother is ab&s;ent, and has declar|ed, that &s;he re&s;igns her will to the will of her friends pre&s;ent&mdash;Allow me to &s;upplicate, that former mea&s;ures may not be changed with her. Great dawn|ings of returning rea&s;on did I di&s;cover in our la&s;t in|terview. Her delicacy (Never was there a more de|licate mind) wanted but to be &s;atisfied. It <HI>was</HI> &s;atis|fied, and &s;he began to be ea&s;y. Were her mind but once compo&s;ed, the &s;en&s;e &s;he has of her duty, and what &s;he owes to her religion, would re&s;tore her to your wi&s;hes: But if &s;he &s;hould be treated har&s;hly (tho' I am &s;ure, if &s;he <HI>&s;hould,</HI> it would be with the be&s;t in|tention) Clementina will be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>The General &s;at down. They all looked upon one another. The two Ladies dried their eyes. The &s;tarting tear <HI>would</HI> accompany my fervor. And then &s;tepping to Jeronymo, who was extremely affected; My dear Jeronymo, &s;aid I, my friend, my beloved friend, cheri&s;h in your noble heart the memory of your Grandi&s;on: Would to God I could attend you to England! We have baths there of &s;overeign effi|cacy. The balm of a friendly and grateful heart would promote the cure. I have urged it before. Con&s;ider of it.</P>
<P>My Grandi&s;on, my dear Grandi&s;on, my friend, my pre&s;erver! You are not going!&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>I am,</HI> my Jeronymo, and embraced him. Love me in ab&s;ence, as I &s;hall you.</P>
<P>Chevalier, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop you don't go? We hope for your company at a &s;mall collation&mdash;We mu&s;t not part with you yet.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="342">
I cannot, my Lord, accept the favour. Altho' I had given my&s;elf up to de&s;pair of obtaining the happi|ne&s;s to which I once a&s;pired; yet I was not willing to quit a city that this family had made dear to me, with the precipitation of a man con&s;cious of mi&s;behaviour. I thank you for the permi&s;&s;ion I had to attend you all in full a&s;&s;embly. May God pro&s;per <HI>you,</HI> my Lord; and may you be inve&s;ted with the fir&s;t honours of that church which mu&s;t be adorned by &s;o worthy a heart; It will be <HI>my</HI> glory, when I am in my native place, or <HI>where-ever</HI> I am, to remember that I was once thought not unworthy of a rank in a family &s;o re&s;pecta|ble. Let me, my Lord, be intitled to your kind re|membrance.</P>
<P>He pulled out his handkerchief. My Lord, &s;aid he, to his father; My Lord, to the General; Grandi&s;on mu&s;t not go!&mdash;and &s;at down with emotion.</P>
<P>Lady Sforza wept: Laurana &s;eemed moved: The two young Lords Seba&s;tino and Juliano, were greatly affected.</P>
<P>I then addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the Marquis, who &s;at undetermined, as to &s;peech: My venerable Lord, forgive me, that my addre&s;s was not fir&s;t paid here. My heart overflows with gratitude for your goodne&s;s in permitting me to throw my&s;elf at your feet, before I took a la&s;t farewel of a city favoured with your re|&s;idence. Be&s;t of fathers, of friends, of men, let me entreat the continuance of your paternal indulgence to the child neare&s;t, and <HI>de&s;erving</HI> to be neare&s;t&punc; to your heart. She is all <HI>you</HI> and <HI>her</HI> mother. Re&s;tore her to your&s;elf, and to her, by your indulgence: That alone, and a ble&s;&s;ing on your prayers, <HI>can</HI> re|&s;tore her. Adieu, my good Lord: Repeated thanks for all your ho&s;pitable goodne&s;s to a man that will ever retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of your favour.</P>
<P>You will not yet go, was all he &s;aid&mdash;He &s;eemed in agitation. He could not &s;ay more.</P>
<P>I then, turning to the Count his brother, who &s;at
<PB N="340" REF="343">
next him, &s;aid, I have had not the honour to be fully known to your Lord&s;hip: Some prejudices from dif|ferences in opinion may have been conceived: But if you ever hear any-thing of the man befoore you <HI>un|worthy</HI> of his name, and of the favour once de&s;igned him: then, my Lord, blame as well as wonder at, the conde&s;cen&s;ion of your noble brother and &s;i&s;ter in my favour.</P>
<P>Who, I! Who I! &s;aid that Lord, in &s;ome hurry.&mdash;I think very well of you. I never &s;aw a man, in my life, that I liked &s;o well!</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip does me honour. I &s;ay this the rather, as I may, on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion, taking leave of &s;uch honourable friends, charge my future life with re&s;olutions to behave worthy of the favour I have met with in this family.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed from him to the General&mdash;Forgive, my Lord, &s;aid I, the &s;eeming formality of my behaviour in this parting &s;cene: It is a very &s;olemn one to me. You have expre&s;&s;ed your&s;elf <HI>of</HI> me, and <HI>to</HI> me, my Lord, with more pa&s;&s;ion (Forgive me, I mean not to offend you) than perhaps you will approve in your|&s;elf when I am far removed from Italy. For have you not a noble mind? And are you not a &s;on of the Marquis della Porretta? Permit me to ob&s;erve, that pa&s;&s;ion will make a man exalt him&s;elf, and de|grade another; and the ju&s;t medium will be then forgot. I am afraid I have been thought more lightly of, than I ought to be, either in ju&s;tice, or for the honour of a per&s;on who is dear to every one pre&s;ent. My country was once mentioned with di&s;|dain: Think not my vanity &s;o much concerned in what I am going to &s;ay, as my honour: I am proud to be thought an Engli&s;hman: Yet I think as highly of every worthy man of every nation under the &s;un, as I do of the worthy men of my own. I am not of a contemptible race in my own country. My father lives in it with the magnificence of a prince.

He loves his &s;on; yet I pre&s;ume to add, that that &s;on deems his good name his riches; his integrity his gran|deur. Princes, tho' they are intitled by their rank to re&s;pect, are princes to him only as they act.</P>
<P>A few words more, my Lord.</P>
<P>I have been of the <HI>hearing,</HI> not of the <HI>&s;peaking</HI> &s;ide of the que&s;tion, in the two la&s;t conferences I had the honour to hold with your Lord&s;hip.

<P>And now, my Lord, allow me the honour of your hand; and as I have given no cau&s;e for di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;ay, that you will remember me with kindne&s;s, as I &s;hall honour you and your whole family to the la&s;t day of my life.</P>
<P>The General heard me out; but it was with great emotion. He accepted not my hand; he returned not any an&s;wer: The Bi&s;hop aro&s;e, and taking him a|&s;ide, endeavoured to calm him.</P>
<P>I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to the two young Lords, and &s;aid, That if ever their curio&s;ity led them to vi&s;it England, where I hoped to be in a few months, I &s;hould be ex|tremely glad of cultivating their e&s;teem and favour, by the be&s;t offices I could do them.</P>
<P>They received my civility with politene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="345">
I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf next to Lady Laurana&mdash;May you madam, the friend, the intimate, the cho&s;en companion of Lady Clementina, never know the hundredth part of the woe that fills the brea&s;t of the man before you, for the calamity that has befallen your admirable cou&s;in, and, becau&s;e of that, a whole excellent family. Let me recommend to you, that tender and &s;oothing treatment to <HI>her,</HI> which her tender heart would &s;hew to <HI>you,</HI> in any calamity that &s;hould befal you. I am not a bad man, madam, tho' of a different communion from yours. Think but half &s;o charitably of me, as I do of every one of your religion who lives up to his profe&s;&s;ions, and I &s;hall be happy in your favourable thoughts when you hear me &s;poken of.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to imagine, Dr. Bartlett, that I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf in this manner to this Lady whom I had never before &s;een, that &s;he might not think the harder of her cou&s;in's prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in favour of a Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>I recommended my&s;elf to the favour of Father Mare&s;cotti. He a&s;&s;ured me of his e&s;teem, in very warm terms.</P>
<P>And ju&s;t as I was again applying to my Jeronymo, the General came to me: You cannot think Sir, &s;aid he, nor did you <HI>de&s;ign</HI> it, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I &s;hould be plea&s;ed with your addre&s;s to me. I have only this que&s;tion to ask, When do you quit Bologna?</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k your Lord&s;hip &s;aid I, When do you re|turn to Naples?</P>
<P>Why that que&s;tion, Sir? haughtily.</P>
<P>I will an&s;wer you frankly. Your Lord&s;hip, at the fir&s;t of my acquaintance with you, invited me to Na|pes, I promi&s;ed to pay my re&s;pects to you there. If you think of being there in a week, I will attend you at your own palace in that city; and there, my Lord, I hope, no cau&s;e to the contrary having ari&s;en from me, to be received by you with the &s;ame kindne&s;s and favour that you &s;hewed when you gave me the invitation. I think to leave Bologna to-morrow.</P>

O brother! &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, Are you not <HI>now</HI> over|come?</P>
<P>And are you in earne&s;t? &s;aid the General.</P>
<P>I am, my Lord. I have many valuable friends at different courts and cities in Italy, to take leave of. I never intend to &s;ee it again. I would look upon your Lord&s;hip as one of tho&s;e friends: But you &s;eem &s;till di&s;plea&s;ed with me. You accepted not my offered hand before: Once more I tender it. A man of &s;pirit cannot be offended at a man of &s;pirit, without le&s;&s;ening him&s;elf. I call upon your dignity, my Lord.</P>
<P>He held out his hand, ju&s;t as I was withdrawing mine. I have pride, you know, Dr. Bartlett; and I was con&s;cious of a &s;uperiority in <HI>this in&s;tance:</HI> I took his hand, however, at his offer; yet pitied him, that his motion was made at all, as it wanted that grace which generally accompanies all he does, and &s;ays.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop embraced me.&mdash;Your moderation, thus exerted, &s;aid he, mu&s;t ever make you triumph. O Grandi&s;on! you are a Prince of the Almighty's creation.</P>
<P>The noble Jeronymo dried his eyes, and held out his arms to embrace me.</P>
<P>The General &s;aid, I &s;hall certainly be at Naples in a week. I am too much affected by the woes of my family, to behave as perhaps I ought on this occa|&s;ion. Indeed, Grandi&s;on, it is difficult for &s;ufferers to act with &s;pirit and temper at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>It <HI>is,</HI> my Lord; I have found it &s;o. My hopes rai&s;ed, as once they were, now &s;unk, and ab&s;olute de&s;pair having taken place of them&mdash;Would to God I had never returned to Italy!&mdash;But I reproach not any-body.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;aid Jeronymo, you have &s;ome rea&s;on&mdash;To be &s;ent for as you were&mdash;He was going on&mdash;Pray, brother, &s;aid the General&mdash;And turning to me, I may expect you, Sir, at Naples?</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="347">
You may, my Lord. But one favour I have to beg of you mean time. It is, That you will not treat har&s;hly <HI>your</HI> dear Clementina.

And permit me to make one other reque&s;t on my own account: And that is, That you will tell her, that I took my leave of your whole family, by their kind permi&s;&s;ion; and that, at my departure, I wi&s;hed her, from my &s;oul, all the happine&s;s that the be&s;t and tendere&s;t of her friends can wi&s;h her! I make this reque&s;t to you, my Lord, rather than to Signor Jeronymo, becau&s;e the tenderne&s;s which he has for me might induce him to mention me to her in a manner which might, at this time, affect her too &s;en&s;ibly for her peace.</P>

<P>I bowed to the Marquis, to the Ladies, to the General, to the Bi&s;hop, particularly; to the re&s;t in general; and was obliged, in order to conceal my e|motion, to hurry out of the door. The &s;ervants had planted them&s;elves in a row; not for &s;elfi&s;h motives, as in England: They bowed to the ground, and ble&s;|&s;ed me, as I went through them. I had ready a pur&s;e of ducats.

every one. The Count &s;aid, He never &s;aw a nobler behaviour in man. Your free, your manly, your po|lite air and addre&s;s, and your calmne&s;s and intrepidi|ty, were applauded by every one.</P>
<P>What joy did this give to your Jeronymo! I thought I wanted neither crutches, helps, nor wheeled chair; and &s;everal times forgot that I ailed any|thing.</P>
<P>I begin to love Father Mare&s;cotti. He was with the foremo&s;t in prai&s;ing you.</P>
<P>The General owned, that he was re&s;olved once to quarrel with you. But will he, do you think, Je|ronymo, &s;aid he, make me a vi&s;it at Naples?&mdash;You may depend upon it, he will, an&s;wered I.&mdash;I will be be there to receive him, replied he.</P>
<P>They admired you particularly for your addre&s;s to my &s;i&s;ter, by the General, rather than by me: And Lady Sforza &s;aid, It was a thou&s;and pities that you and Clementina could not be one. They applauded, all of them, what they had not, any of them, the power to imitate, that largene&s;s of heart which makes you think &s;o well, and &s;peak &s;o tenderly, of tho&s;e of communions different from your own. So much &s;teadine&s;s in your own Religion, yet &s;o much pru|dence, in a man &s;o young, they &s;aid, was a&s;toni&s;h|ing! No wonder that your character ran &s;o high, in every court you had vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>My mother came in &s;oon after you had left us. She was equally &s;urpri&s;ed and grieved to find you gone. She thought &s;he was &s;ure of your &s;taying &s;upper; and, not &s;atisfied with the &s;light leave &s;he had taken, &s;he had been &s;trengthening her mind to pa&s;s an hour in your company, in order to take a more &s;olemn one.</P>
<P>My father a&s;ked her after her daughter.</P>
<P>Poor &s;oul! &s;aid &s;he, &s;he has heard that the Cheva|lier was to be here, to take leave of us.</P>
<P>By whom? By whom? &s;aid my father.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="350">
I cannot tell: But the poor creature is half-raving to be admitted among us. She has dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in one of her be&s;t &s;uits; and I found her &s;itting in a kind of form, expecting to be called down. Indeed, Lady Sforza, the method we are in, does not do.</P>
<P>So the Chevalier &s;aid, replied that Lady. Well let us change it, with all my heart. It is no plea&s;ure to treat the dear Girl har&s;hly&mdash;O &s;i&s;ter! this is a mo&s;t extraordinary man!</P>

<P>Three &s;oft taps at the door, and a hem, let us know &s;he was there.</P>
<P>Let her come in, dear girl, let her come in, &s;aid the Count: The Chevalier is not here.</P>
<P>Laurana aro&s;e, and ran to the door, and led her in by the hand.</P>
<P>Dear creature, How wild &s;he looked!&mdash;Tears ran down my cheeks: I had not &s;een her for two days before. O how earne&s;tly did &s;he look round her! withdrawing her hand from her cou&s;in, who would have led her to a chair, and &s;tanding quite &s;till.</P>
<P>Come and &s;it by me, my &s;weet love, &s;aid her weep|ing mother.&mdash;She &s;tept towards her.</P>
<P>Sit down, my dear girl.</P>
<P>No: You beat me, remember.</P>
<P>Who beat you, my dear?&mdash;Sure nobody would beat my child!&mdash;Who beat you, Clementina?</P>
<P>I don't know&mdash;Still looking round her, as wanting &s;omebody.</P>
<P>Again her mother courted her to &s;it down.</P>
<P>No, madam, you don't love me.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, I do.</P>
<P>So you &s;ay.</P>
<P>Her father held out his open arms to her. Tears ran down his cheeks. He could not &s;peak.&mdash;Ah, my father! &s;aid &s;he, &s;tepping towards him.</P>

He caught her in his arms&mdash;Don't, don't, Sir, faintly &s;truggling, with averted face&mdash;You love me not&mdash;You refu&s;ed to &s;ee your child, when &s;he wanted to claim your protection!&mdash;I was u&s;ed cruelly.</P>
<P>By whom, my dear? by whom?</P>
<P>By every-body. I complained to one, and to an|other; but all were in a tone: And &s;o I thought I would be contented. My mamma, too!&mdash;But it is no matter. I &s;aw it was to be &s;o; and I did not care.</P>
<P>By my &s;oul, &s;aid I, this is not the way with her, Lady Sforza. The Chevalier is in the right. You &s;ee how &s;en&s;ible &s;he is of har&s;h treatment.</P>
<P>Well, well, &s;aid the General, let us change our mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Still the dear girl looked out earne&s;tly, as for Some|body.</P>
<P>She loo&s;ed her&s;elf from the arms of her &s;orrowing father.</P>
<P>Let us in &s;ilence, &s;aid the Count, ob&s;erve her mo|tions.</P>
<P>She went to him on tip-toe, and looking in his face over his &s;houlder, as he &s;at with his back towards her, pa&s;&s;ed him; then to the General; then to Signor Seba&s;tiano; and to every one round, till &s;he came to me; looking at each over his &s;houlder in the &s;ame manner: Then folding her fingers, her hands open, and her arm hanging down to their full extent, &s;he held up her face meditating, with &s;uch a &s;ignificant woe, that I thought my heart would have bur&s;t.&mdash;Not a &s;oul in the company had a dry eye.</P>
<P>Lady Sforza aro&s;e, took her two bands, the fingers &s;till cla&s;ped, and would have &s;poken to her, but could not; and ha&s;tily retired to her &s;eat.</P>
<P>Tears, at la&s;t, began to trickle down her cheeks, as &s;he &s;tood fixedly looking up. She &s;tarted, looked about her, and ha&s;tening to her mother, threw her arms about her neck, and hiding her face in her bo|&s;om, broke out into a &s;tood of tears, mingled with &s;obs that penetrated every heart.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="352">
The fir&s;t words &s;he &s;aid, were, Love me, my mamma! Love your child! your poor child! your Clementina! Then rai&s;ing her head, and again laying it in her mother's bo&s;om&mdash;If ever you loved me, love me now, my mamma!&mdash;I have need of your love!</P>
<P>My father was forced to withdraw. He was led out by his two &s;ons.</P>
<P>Your poor Jeronymo was unable to help him&s;elf. He wanted as much comfort as his father. What were the wounds of his body, at that time, to tho&s;e of his mind?</P>
<P>My two brothers returned. This dear girl, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, will break all our hearts.</P>
<P>Her tears had &s;eemed to relieve her. She held up her head. My mother's bo&s;om &s;eemed wet with her child's tears and her own. Still &s;he looked round her.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, &s;aid I, &s;omebody were to name the man &s;he &s;eems to look for? It may divert this wildne&s;s.</P>
<P>Did &s;he come down, &s;aid Laurana to Camilla, with the expectation of &s;eeing him?</P>
<P>She did.</P>
<P>Let <HI>me,</HI> &s;aid the Bi&s;hop, &s;peak to her. He aro&s;e, and, taking her hand, walked with her about the room. You look pretty, my Clementina! Your or|naments are charmingly fan&s;ied. What made you dre&s;s your&s;elf &s;o prettily?</P>
<P>She looked earne&s;tly at him, in &s;ilence. He re|peated his que&s;tion&mdash;I &s;peak, &s;aid &s;he, all my heart; and then I &s;uffer for it. Every-body is again&s;t me.</P>
<P>You &s;hall not &s;uffer for it: Every-body is for you.</P>
<P>I confe&s;&s;ed to Mrs. Beaumont; I confe&s;&s;ed to you, brother: But what did I get by it?&mdash;Let go my hand. I don't love you, I believe.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry for it. I love you, Clementina, as I love my own &s;oul!</P>
<P>Yet you never chide your own &s;oul!</P>
<P>He turned his &s;ace from her to us. She mu&s;t not be treated har&s;hly, &s;aid he. He &s;oothed her in a truly brotherly manner.</P>

<P>No matter. If you are afraid, I will go by my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Seem to humour her in talk, Camilla, &s;aid the Count; but don't go out of the room with her.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to tell me, madam, what we are to walk in the garden for?</P>
<P>Why, Camilla, I had a horrid dream la&s;t night; and I cannot be ea&s;y till I go into the garden.</P>
<P>What, madam, was your dream?</P>
<P>In the Orange-grove, I thought I &s;tumbled over the body of a dead-man!</P>
<P>And who was it, madam?</P>
<P>Don't you know who was threatned? And was not Somebody here to night? And was not Some|body to &s;up here? And <HI>is</HI> he here?</P>

<P>She went from me to her aunt, and cou&s;in Lau|rana. Love me again, madam, &s;aid &s;he, to the for|mer. You loved me once.</P>
<P>I never loved you better than now, my dear.</P>
<P>Did <HI>you,</HI> Laurana, &s;ee the Chevalier Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>I did.</P>
<P>And did he go away &s;afe, and unhurt?</P>
<P>Indeed he did.</P>
<P>A man who had pre&s;erved the life of our dear Je|ronymo, &s;aid &s;he, to have been hurt by us, would have been dreadful, you know. I wanted to &s;ay a few words to him. I was a&s;toni&s;hed to find him not here: And then my dream came into my head. It was a &s;ad dream, indeed! But, cou&s;in, be good to me: Pray do. You did not u&s;e to be cruel. You u&s;ed to &s;ay, you loved me. I am in calamity, my dear. I know I am mi&s;erable. At times I know I am; and then I am grieved at my heart, and think how happy every one is, but me: But then, again, I ail nothing, and am well. But do, love me, Lau|rana: I am in calamity, my dear. I would love you, if you were in calamity: Indeed I would.&mdash;Ah, Laurana! What is become of all your fine promi&s;es? But then every-body loved me, and I was happy!&mdash;Yet you tell me, It is all for my good. Naughty Laurana&mdash;To wound my heart by your cro&s;&s;ne&s;s, and then &s;ay, It is for my good!&mdash;Do you think I &s;hould have &s;erved you &s;o?</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="356">
Laurana blu&s;hed, and wept. Her aunt promi&s;ed her, that every-body would love her, and comfort her, and not be angry with her, if &s;he would make her heart ea&s;y.</P>
<P>I am very particular, my dear Grandi&s;on. I know you love I &s;hould be &s;o. From this minutene&s;s, you will judge of the workings of her mind. They are re&s;olved to take your advice (It was very &s;ea&s;onable), and treat her with indulgence. The Count is earne&s;t to have it &s;o.</P>
<P>CAMILLA has ju&s;t left me. She &s;ays, That her young Lady had a tolerable night. She thinks it owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to her being indulged in a&s;king the &s;ervants, who &s;aw you depart, how you looked; and being &s;atisfied that you went away un|hurt, and un-affronted.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t, my be&s;t friend. Let me hear from you, as often as you can.</P>
<P>I JUST now under&s;tand from Camilla, that the dear girl has made an earne&s;t reque&s;t to my father, mother, and aunt; and been refu&s;ed. She came back from them deeply afflicted, and, as Camilla fears, is going into one of her gloomy fits again. I hope to write again, if you depart not from Bologna before to-morrow: But I mu&s;t, for my own &s;ake, write &s;horter Letters. Yet how can I? Since, however melancholy the &s;ubject, when I am writing to you, I am conver&s;ing with you. My dear Grandi&s;on, once more</P>

<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s twelfth Letter.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Grandi&s;on proceeds thus:</P>
<P>The next morning I employed my&s;elf in vi|&s;iting and taking leave of &s;everal worthy members of the Univer&s;ity, with whom I had pa&s;&s;ed many very agreeable and improving hours, during my re&s;idence in this noble city. In my Literary Journal you have an account of tho&s;e worthy per&s;ons, and of &s;ome of our conver&s;ations. I paid my duty to the Cardinal Legate, and the Gonfaloniere, and to three of his coun&s;ellors, by whom, you know, I had been like|wi&s;e greatly honoured. My mind was not free enough to <HI>enjoy</HI> their conver&s;ation: Such a weight upon my heart, how could it? But the debt of gratitude and civility was not to be left unpaid.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="358">
On my return to my lodgings, which was not till the evening, I found, the General had been there to enquire after me.</P>
<P>I &s;ent one of my &s;ervants to the palace of Porretta, with my compliments to the General, to the Bi&s;hop, and Jeronymo; and with particular enquiries after the health of the Ladies, and the Marquis; but had only a general an&s;wer, That they were much as I left them.</P>
<P>The two young Lords, Seba&s;tiano and Juliano, made me a vi&s;it of ceremony. They talked of vi&s;it|ing England in a year or two. I a&s;&s;ured them of my be&s;t &s;ervices, and urged them to go thither. I a&s;ked them after the healths of the Marquis, the Mar|chione&s;s, and their beloved cou&s;in Clementina. Sig|nor Seba&s;tiano &s;hook his head: Very, <HI>very</HI> indifferent, were his words. We parted with great civilities.</P>
<P>I will now turn my thoughts to Florence, and to the affairs there that have lain upon me, from the death of my good friend Mr. Jervois, and from my ward&s;hip. I told you in their cour&s;e, the &s;teps I took in tho&s;e affairs; and how happy I had been in &s;ome parts of management. There I hope &s;oon to &s;ee you, my dear Dr. Bartlett, from the Levant, to who&s;e care I can &s;o &s;afely con&s;ign my precious tru&s;t, while I go to Paris, and attend the wi&s;hed-for call of my father to my native country, from which I have been for &s;o many years an exile.</P>
<P>There al&s;o I hope to have &s;ome opportunities of conver&s;ing with my good Mrs. Beaumont; re&s;olving to make another effort to get &s;o valuable a per&s;on to re&s;tore her&s;elf to her beloved England.</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Dr. Bartlett, do I endeavour to con&s;ole my&s;elf, in order to lighten that load of grief which I labour under on the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the dear Clementina. If I can leave her happy, I &s;hall be &s;ooner &s;o, than I could have been in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances, had I, from the fir&s;t of my acquaintance with
<PB N="356" REF="359">
the family (to the breach of all the laws of ho&s;pita|lity) indulged a pa&s;&s;ion for her.</P>
<P>Yet is the unhappy Olivia a damp upon my en|deavours after con&s;olation. When &s;he made her un|&s;ea&s;onable vi&s;it to me at Bologna, &s;he refu&s;ed to re|turn to Florence without me, till I a&s;&s;ured her, that as my affairs would &s;oon call me thither, I would vi&s;it her at her own palace, as often as tho&s;e affairs would permit. Her pretence for coming to Bologna was, to induce me to place Emily with her, till I had &s;et|tled every-thing for my carrying the child to England; &s;he had wrought &s;o with Emily, as to induce her to be an earne&s;t petitioner to me, to permit her to live with Lady Olivia, who&s;e equipages, and the glare in which &s;he lives, had dazled the eyes of the young Lady.</P>
<P>I was impatient to hear again from Jeronymo; and ju&s;t as I was &s;etting out for Florence, in de&s;pair of that &s;avour, it being the &s;econd day after my fare|wel vi&s;it, I had the following Letter from him:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Have not been well, my dear Grandi&s;on. I am afraid the wound in my &s;houlder mu&s;t be laid open again. God give me patience! But my life is a bur|den to me.</P>
<P>We are driving here at a &s;trange rate. They pro|mi&s;ed to keep mea&s;ures with the dear creature; but &s;he has heard that you are leaving Bologna, and raves to &s;ee you.</P>
<P>Poor &s;oul! She endeavoured to prevail upon her father, mother, aunt, to permit her to &s;ee you, but for <HI>five</HI> minutes: That was the petition which was denied her, as I mentioned in my la&s;t.</P>
<P>Camilla was afraid that &s;he would go into a gloomy fit upon it, as I told you&mdash;She did; but it la&s;ted not long: For &s;he made an effort, &s;oon after, to go out of
<PB N="357" REF="360">
the hou&s;e by way of the garden. The gardener re|fu&s;ed his key, and brought Camilla to her, whom &s;he had, by an innocent piece of art, but ju&s;t before, &s;ent to bring her &s;omething from her toilette.</P>
<P>The General went with Camilla to her. They found her ju&s;t &s;etting a ladder again&s;t the wall. She heard them, and &s;creamed, and, leaving the ladder, ran, to avoid them, till &s;he came in &s;ight of the great ca&s;cade; into which, had &s;he not by a cro&s;s alley been intercepted by the General, it is feared &s;he would have thrown her&s;elf.</P>
<P>This has terrified us all: She begs but for one in|terview; one parting interview; and &s;he promi&s;es to make her&s;elf ea&s;y: But it is not thought advi&s;eable. Yet Father Mare&s;cotti him&s;elf thought it be&s;t to in|dulge her. Had my mother been earne&s;t, I believe it had been granted: But &s;he is &s;o much concerned at the blame &s;he met with on permitting the la&s;t in|terview, that &s;he will not contend, tho' &s;he has let them know, that &s;he did not oppo&s;e the reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The unhappy girl ran into my chamber this morn|ing&mdash;Jeronymo! He will be <HI>gone,</HI> &s;aid &s;he; I <HI>know</HI> he will. All I want is, but to &s;ee him! To wi&s;h him happy! And to know, If he will remember me when he is gone, as I &s;hall him!&mdash;Have <HI>you</HI> no intere&s;t, Jeronymo? Cannot I <HI>once</HI> &s;ee him? Not <HI>once?</HI></P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop, before I could an&s;wer, came in que&s;t of her, followed by Laurana, from whom &s;he had forcibly di&s;engaged her&s;elf, to come to me.</P>
<P>Let me have but one parting interview, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, looking to him, and clinging about my neck. He will be gone: Gone for ever. Is there &s;o in being allowed to &s;ay, Farewel, and be happy, Grandi&s;on! and excu&s;e all the trouble I have given you?&mdash;What has my brother's pre&s;erver done, what have I done, that I mu&s;t not &s;ee him, nor he me, for one quarter of an hour only?</P>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, &s;aid I, &s;he &s;hould be complied with. Indeed &s;he &s;hould.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="361">
My <HI>Father</HI> thinks otherwi&s;e, &s;aid the Bi&s;hop: The <HI>Count</HI> thinks otherwi&s;e: <HI>I</HI> think otherwi&s;e. Were the Chevalier a common man, &s;he might. But &s;he dwells upon what pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t interview, and his behaviour to her. <HI>That,</HI> it is plain, did her harm.</P>
<P>The next may drive the thoughts of that out of her head, returned I.</P>
<P>Dear Jeronymo, replied he, a little peevi&s;hly, you will always think differently from every-body el&s;e! Mrs. Beaumont comes to-morrow.</P>
<P>What do I care for Mrs. Beaumont? &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;I don't love her: She tells every-thing I &s;ay.</P>
<P>Come, my dear love, &s;aid Laurana, you afflict your brother Jeronymo. Let us go up to your own chamber.</P>
<P>I afflict every-body, and every-body afflicts me; and you are all cruel. Why, he will be <HI>gone,</HI> I tell you! That makes me &s;o impatient: and I have &s;omething to &s;ay to him. My father won't &s;ee me: My mother renounces me. I have been looking for her, and &s;he hides her&s;elf from me!&mdash;And I am a pri&s;oner, and watched, and u&s;ed ill!</P>
<P>Here comes my mother! &s;aid Laurana. You now <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go up to your chamber, cou&s;in Clementina.</P>
<P>So &s;he does, &s;aid &s;he: Now I mu&s;t go, indeed!&mdash;Ah, Jeronymo! Now there is no &s;aying nay!&mdash;But it is hard! <HI>Very</HI> hard!&mdash;And &s;he bur&s;t into tears. I won't &s;peak tho', &s;aid &s;he, to my aunt. Remember, I will be &s;ilent, madam!&mdash;Then whi&s;pering me, My aunt, brother, is not the aunt &s;he u&s;ed to be to me!&mdash;But hu&s;h, I don't complain, you know!</P>
<P>By this I &s;aw that Lady Sforza was &s;evere with her.</P>
<P>She addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to her aunt: You are not my mamma, are you, madam?</P>
<P>No, child.</P>
<P>No, child, indeed! I know that <HI>too</HI> well. But my brother Giacomo is as cruel to me as any-body. But hu&s;h, Jeronymo!&mdash;Don't you betray me!&mdash;Now my

<P>She was ye&s;terday detected writing a Letter to you. My mother was &s;hewn what &s;he had written, and wept over it. My aunt took it out of my &s;i&s;ter's bo|&s;om, where &s;he had tru&s;t it, on her coming in. This &s;he re&s;ented highly.</P>
<P>When &s;he was led into her own chamber, &s;he re|fu&s;ed to &s;peak; but in great hurry went to her clo&s;et, and taking down her bible, turned over one leaf and another very quick. Lady Sforza had a book in her hand, and &s;at over-again&s;t the clo&s;et-door to ob&s;erve her motions. She came to a place&mdash;<HI>Pretty!</HI> &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop had formerly given her a &s;mattering of Latin&mdash;She took pen and ink, and wrote. You'll &s;ee, Chevalier, the very great purity of her thoughts, by what &s;he omitted, and what &s;he cho&s;e, from the Canticles. <HI>Velut unguentum diffunditur nomen tuum,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>Look not upon me becau&s;e I am black, becau&s;e the &s;un hath looked upon me. My mother's children were angry with me: They made me the keeper of the vineyards, but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</P>

<P>She laid down her pen, and was thoughtful; her elbow re&s;ting on the e&s;critoire &s;he wrote upon, her hand &s;upporting her head.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on, having no hopes of being allowed to &s;ee the unhappy Lady, &s;et out with a heavy heart for Florence. He gave orders there, and at Leghorn, that the clerks and agents of his late friend Mr. Jer|vois &s;hould prepare every thing for his in&s;pection a|gain&s;t his return from Naples; and then he &s;et out for that city, to attend the General.</P>
<P>He had other friends to whom he had endeared him&s;elf at Sienna, Ancona, and particularly at Rome, as he had al&s;o &s;ome at Naples; of whom he intended to take leave, before he &s;et out for Paris: And there|fore went to attend the General with the greater plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Within the appointed time he arrived at Naples.</P>
<P>The General received me, &s;ays Mr. Grandi&s;on, with greater tokens of politene&s;s than affection. You are the happie&s;t man in the world, Chevalier, &s;aid he, after the fir&s;t compliments, in e&s;caping dangers by braving them. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I had great difficulties to deny my&s;elf the favour of paying you a vi&s;it <HI>in my own way</HI> at Bologna. I had indeed re&s;olved to do it, till you propo&s;ed this vi&s;it to me here.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been very &s;orry, replied I, to have &s;een a brother of Lady Clementina in any way that
<PB N="361" REF="364">
&s;hould not have made me con&s;ider him as her brother. But, before I &s;ay another word, let me a&s;k after her health. How does the mo&s;t excellent of women?</P>
<P>You have not heard, then?</P>
<P>I have not, my Lord: But it is not for want of &s;o|licitude. I have &s;ent three &s;everal me&s;&s;engers, but can hear nothing to my &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Nor can you hear any thing from me that will give you any.</P>
<P>I am grieved at my &s;oul, that I cannot. How, my Lord, do the Marquis and Marchione&s;s?</P>
<P>Don't a&s;k. They are extremely unhappy.</P>
<P>I hear that my dear friend Signor Jeronymo, has undergone&mdash;</P>
<P>A dreadful operation, innterrupted the General.&mdash;He has. Poor Jeronymo! He <HI>could not</HI> write to you. God pre&s;erve my brother! But, Chevalier, you did not &s;ave half a life, tho' we thank you for that, when you re&s;tored him to our arms.</P>
<P>I had no rea&s;on to boa&s;t, my Lord, of the acci|dent. I never made a merit of it. It was a <HI>mere</HI> accident, and co&s;t me nothing. The &s;ervice was greatly over-rated.</P>
<P>Would to God, Chevalier, it had been rendered by any other man in the world!</P>
<P>As it has proved, I am &s;ure, my Lord, I have rea|&s;on to join in the wi&s;h.</P>
<P>He &s;hewed me his pictures, &s;tatues, and cabinet of curio&s;ities, while dinner was preparing; but rather for the o&s;tentation of his magnificence and ta&s;te, than to do me plea&s;ure. I even ob&s;erved an increa&s;ing coldne&s;s in his behaviour; and his eye was too often ca&s;t upon me with a fiercene&s;s that &s;hewed re&s;ent|ment; and not with the ho&s;pitable frankne&s;s that be|came him to a vi&s;iter and gue&s;t who had undertaken a journey of above two hundred miles, principally to attend him, and to &s;hew him the confidence he had in his honour. This, as it was more to his di&s;honour
<PB N="362" REF="365">
than mine, I pitied him for. But what mo&s;t of all di&s;turbed me, was, that I could not obtain from him any particular intelligence relating to the health of one per&s;on, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es lay heavy upon my heart.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction at dinner; the di&s;cour&s;e could therefore be only general. He paid me great re&s;pect at his table, but it was a &s;olemn one. I was the more unea&s;y at it, as I apprehended, that the &s;ituation of the Bologna family was more un|happy than when I left that city.</P>
<P>He retired with me into his garden. You &s;tay with me at lea&s;t the week out, Chevalier?</P>
<P>No, my Lord: I have affairs of a decea&s;ed friend at Florence and at Leghorn to &s;ettle. To-morrow, as early as I can, I &s;hall &s;et out for Rome, in my way to Tu&s;cany.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpri&s;ed, Chevalier. You take &s;omething ami&s;s in my behaviour.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ay that your Lord&s;hip's countenance (I am a very free &s;peaker) has that benignity in it, that complacency, which I have had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee in it.</P>
<P>By G. Chevalier, I could have loved you better than any man in the world, next to the men of my own family; but I own I &s;ee you not here with &s;o much love as admiration.</P>
<P>The word <HI>admiration,</HI> my Lord, may require ex|planation. You may admire at my confidence: But I thank you for the manly freedom of your acknow|legement in general.</P>
<P>By <HI>admiration</HI> I mean, all that may do you honour. Your bravery in coming hither, particularly; and your greatne&s;s of mind on your taking leave of us all. But did you not then mean to in&s;ult me?</P>
<P>I meant to ob&s;erve to you then, as I now do in your own palace, that you had not treated me as my heart told me I de&s;erved to be treated: But when I thought your warmth was ri&s;ing to the unea&s;ine&s;s of
<PB N="363" REF="366">
your a&s;&s;embled friends, in&s;tead of an&s;wering your que|&s;tion about my &s;tay at Bologna, as you &s;eemed to mean it, I invited my&s;elf to an attendance upon you here, at Naples, in &s;uch a manner as &s;urely could not be con&s;trued an in&s;ult.</P>
<P>I own, Grandi&s;on, you di&s;concerted me. I had intended to &s;ave you that journey.</P>
<P>Was that your Lord&s;hip's meaning, when, in my ab&s;ence, you called at my lodgings, the day after the farewel-vi&s;it?</P>
<P>Not ab&s;olutely: I was unea&s;y with my&s;elf. I in|tended to talk to you. What that talk might have produced, I know not: But had I invited you out, if I had found you at home, would you have an&s;wered my demands?</P>
<P>According as you had put them.</P>
<P>Will you an&s;wer them now, if I attend you as far as Rome, on your return to Florence?</P>
<P>If they are demands fit to be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Do you expect I will make any that are <HI>not</HI> fit to be an&s;wered?</P>
<P>My Lord, I will explain my&s;elf. You had con|ceived cau&s;ele&s;s prejudices again&s;t me: You &s;eemed inclined to impute to me a misfortune that was not, could not be, greater to you than it was to me. I knew my own innocence: I knew that I was rather an injured man, in having hopes given me, in which I was di&s;appointed, not by my own fault: Whom &s;hall an innocent and an injured man fear?&mdash;Had I feared, my fear might have been my de&s;truction. For was I not in the mid&s;t of your friends? A fo|reigner? If I <HI>would</HI> have avoided you, <HI>could</HI> I, had you been determined to &s;eek me?&mdash;I would choo&s;e to meet even an enemy as a man of honour, rather than to avoid him as a malefactor. In my country, the law &s;uppo&s;es flight a confe&s;&s;ion of guilt. Had you made demands upon me that I had not cho&s;en to an|&s;wer, I would have expo&s;tulated with you. I could

Perhaps have done &s;o as calmly as I now &s;peak. If you would not have been expo&s;tulated with, I would have &s;tood upon my defence: But for the world I would not have hurt a brother of Clementina and Je|ronymo, a &s;on of the Marquis and Marchione&s;s of Porretta, could I have avoided it. Had your pa&s;&s;ion given me any advantage over you, and I had obtained your &s;word (a pi&s;tol, had the choice been left to me, I had refu&s;ed for both our &s;akes), I would have pre|&s;ented both &s;words to you, and bared my brea&s;t: It was before penetrated by the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the dear Clementina, and of all your family&mdash;Perhaps I &s;hould only have &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'If your Lord&s;hip thinks I have in|jured you, take your revenge.'</Q></P>
<P>And now, that I am at Naples, let me &s;ay, that if you are determined, contrary to all my hopes, to accompany me to Rome, or el&s;ewhere, on my re|turn, with an unfriendly purpo&s;e; &s;uch, and no other, &s;hall be my behaviour to you, if the power be given me to &s;hew it.

<P>Superlative pride! angrily &s;aid he, and &s;tood &s;till, mea&s;uring me with his eye: And could you hope for &s;uch an advantage.</P>
<P>While I, my Lord, was calm, and determined only upon &s;elf-defence; while you were pa&s;&s;ionate, and perhaps ra&s;h, as aggre&s;&s;ors generally are; I did not doubt it: But could I have avoided drawing, and pre&s;erved your good opinion, I would not have drawn. Your Lord&s;hip cannot but know my prin|ciples.</P>
<P>Grandi&s;on, I <HI>do</HI> know them; and al&s;o the general report in your favour for &s;kill and courage. Do you think I would have heard with patience of the once propo&s;ed alliance, had not your character&mdash;And then he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay many things in my favour,
<PB N="365" REF="368">
from the report of per&s;ons who had weight with him; &s;ome of whom he named.</P>
<P>But &s;till, Grandi&s;on, &s;aid he, this poor girl&mdash;She could not have been &s;o deeply affected, had not &s;ome Lover-like arts&mdash;</P>
<P>Let me, my Lord, interrupt you&mdash;I cannot bear an imputation of this kind. <HI>Had</HI> &s;uch arts been u&s;ed, the Lady could <HI>not</HI> have been &s;o much affected. Can|not you think of your noble &s;i&s;ter, as a daughter of the two hou&s;es from which you &s;prang&punc; Cannot you &s;ee her, as by Mrs. Beaumont's means we now &s;o lately have been able to &s;ee her, &s;truggling nobly with her own heart [Why am I put upon this tender &s;ubject?] becau&s;e of her duty and her religion; and re|&s;olved to die rather than encourage a wi&s;h that was not warranted by both?&mdash;I cannot, my Lord, urge this &s;ubject: But there never was a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o nobly contended with. There never was a man more di&s;|intere&s;ted, and &s;o circum&s;tanced. Remember only, my voluntary departure from Bologna, again&s;t per&s;ua|&s;ion; and the great behaviour of your &s;i&s;ter on that occa&s;ion, great, as it came out to be, when Mrs. Beaumont brought her to acknowlege what would have been my glory to have kown, could it have been encouraged; but is now made my heavie&s;t con|cern.</P>
<P>Indeed, Grandi&s;on, &s;he ever was a noble girl! We are too apt perhaps to govern our&s;elves by events, without looking into cau&s;es: But the acce&s;s you had to her; &s;uch a man! and who became known to us from circum&s;tances &s;o much in his favour, both as a man of principle and bravery&mdash;</P>
<P>This, my Lord, interrupted I, is &s;till judging from events. You have &s;een Mrs. Beaumont's Letter. Surely you cannot have a nobler monument of mag|nanimity in woman! And to that I refer, for a proof of my own integrity.</P>
<P>I <HI>have</HI> that Letter: Jeronymo gave it me, at my

<P>He took it out of his pocket, walked from me, and read it; and then came to me, and took my hand&mdash;I am half a&s;hamed of my&s;elf, my dear Gran|di&s;on: I own I wanted magnanimity.

I will let our Jeronymo know how greatly you &s;ubdued me before I had recour&s;e to the Letter; but that I have &s;ince read that part of it which accounts for my &s;i&s;ter's pa&s;&s;ion, and wi&s;h I had read it with equal attention before.

<P>REceive now, my dear, the doctor's thirteenth Letter, and the la&s;t he intends to favour us with, till he entertains us with the hi&s;tories of Mrs. Beau|mont, and Lady Olivia.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Dr. <HI>Bartlett</HI>'s thirteenth Letter.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Grandi&s;on &s;et out next morning. The Ge|neral's behaviour to him at his departure, was much more open and free than it was at receiving him.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on, on his return to Florence, entered into the affairs of his late friend Mr. Jervois, with the &s;pirit, and yet with the temper, for which he is noted, when he engages in any bu&s;ine&s;s. He put every thing in a happy train in fewer days than it would have co&s;t &s;ome other per&s;ons months; for he was pre&s;ent him&s;elf on every occa&s;ion, and in every bu&s;ine&s;s, where his pre&s;ence would accelerate it: Yet he had embarra&s;&s;ments from Olivia.</P>
<P>He found, before he &s;et out for Naples, that Mrs. Beaumont, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the Marchione&s;s, was gone to Bologna. At his return, not hearing any-thing from Signor Jeronymo, he wrote to Mrs. Beaumont, reque&s;ting her to inform him of the &s;tate of things in that family, as far as &s;he thought proper;
<PB N="368" REF="371">
and, particularly, of the health of that dear friend, on who&s;e &s;ilence to three Letters he had written, he had the mo&s;t melancholy apprehen&s;ions. He let that Lady know, that he &s;hould &s;et out in a very few days for Paris, if he had no probability of being of &s;ervice to the family &s;he favoured with her company.</P>
<P>To this Letter Mrs. Beaumont returned the follow|ing an&s;wer:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have the favour of yours. We are very mi&s;erable here. The &s;ervants are forbidden to an&s;wer any enquiries, but generally; and that not truly.</P>
<P>Your friend, Signor Jeronymo, has gone through a &s;evere operation. He has been given over; but hopes are now entertained, not of his ab&s;olute recovery, but that he will be no wor&s;e than he was before the ne|ce&s;&s;ity for the operation aro&s;e. Poor man! He forgot not, however, his &s;i&s;ter and you, when he was out of the power of the opiates that were admin&s;tred to him.</P>
<P>On my coming hither, I found Lady Clementina in a deplorable way: Sometimes raving, &s;ometimes gloomy; and in bonds&mdash;Twice had &s;he given them apprehen&s;ions of fatal attempts: They therefore con|fined her hands.</P>
<P>They have been exce&s;&s;ively wrong in their manage|ment of her: Now &s;oothing, now &s;evere; ob&s;erving no method.</P>
<P>She was extremely earne&s;t to &s;ee you before you le&s;t Bologna. On her knees repeatedly &s;he be&s;ought this favour, and promi&s;ed to be ea&s;y if they would comply; but they imagined that their compliance would aggravate the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>I very freely blamed them for not complying, at the time when &s;he was &s;o de&s;irous of &s;eeing you. I told them, that &s;oothing her would probably <HI>then</HI> have done good.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="372">
When they knew you were actually gone from Bologna, they told her &s;o. Camilla &s;hocked me with the de&s;cription of her rage and de&s;pair, on the com|munication. This was followed by fits of &s;ilence, and the deepe&s;t melancholy.</P>
<P>They had hopes, on my arrival, that my company would have been of &s;ervice to her: But for two days together &s;he regarded me not, nor any-thing I could &s;ay to her. On the third of my arrival, finding her confinement extremely unea&s;y to her, I prevailed, but with great difficulty, to have her re&s;tored to the u&s;e of her hands; and to be allowed to walk with me in the garden. They had hinted to me their apprehen|&s;ions about a piece of water.</P>
<P>Her woman being near us, if there had been occa|&s;ion for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I in&s;en&s;ibly led that way. She &s;at down on a &s;eat over-again&s;t the great ca&s;cade; but &s;he made no motion that gave me apprehen&s;ions. From this time &s;he has been fonder of me than be|fore. The day I obtained this liberty for her, &s;he often cla&s;ped her arms about me, and laid her face in my bo&s;om; and I could plainly &s;ee, it was in grati|tude for re&s;toring to her the u&s;e of her arms: But &s;he cared not to &s;peak.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he generally affects deep &s;ilence: Yet, at times, I &s;ee her very &s;oul is fretted. She moves to one place, is tired of that, &s;hifts to another, and an|other, all round the room.</P>
<P>I am grieved at my heart for her: I never knew a more excellent young creature.</P>
<P>She is very attentive at her devotions, and as con|&s;tant in them as &s;he u&s;ed to be: Every good habit &s;he pre&s;erves; yet, at other times, rambles much.</P>
<P>She is often for writing Letters to you; but when what &s;he writes is privately taken from her, &s;he makes no enquiry about it, but takes a new &s;heet, and begins again.</P>
<P>Sometimes &s;he draws: But her &s;ubjects are gene|rally,
<PB N="370" REF="373">
Angels and Saints. She often meditates in a map of the Briti&s;h dominions, and now-and-then wi&s;hes &s;he were in England.</P>
<P>Lady Juliana de Sforza is earne&s;t to have her with her at Urbino, or at Milan, where &s;he has al&s;o a noble palace; but I hope it will not be granted. That Lady profe&s;&s;es to love her; but &s;he cannot be per|&s;uaded out of her notion of harch methods which will never do with Clementina.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not be able to &s;tay long with her. The di&s;|compo&s;ure of &s;o excellent a young creature affects me deeply. Could I do her either good her plea&s;ure, I &s;hould be willing to deny my&s;elf the &s;ociety of my dear friends at Florence: But I am per&s;uaded, and have hinted as much, that one interview with you would do more to &s;ettle her mind, than all the methods they have taken.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, to &s;ee you before you leave Italy. It mu&s;t be at Florence, not at Bologna, I believe. It is generous of you to propo&s;e the latter.</P>
<P>I have now been here a week, without hope. The doctors they have con&s;ulted are all for &s;evere methods, and low diet. The fir&s;t, I think, is in compliment to &s;ome of the family: She is &s;o loth to take nou|ri&s;hment, and when &s;he does, is &s;o very ab&s;temious, that the regimen is hardly nece&s;&s;ary. She never, or but very &s;eldom, u&s;ed to drink any-thing but water.</P>
<P>She took it into her poor head &s;everal times this day, and perhaps it will hold, to &s;it in particular places, to put on attentive looks, as if &s;he were li&s;ten|ing to &s;omebody. She &s;ometimes &s;miled, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed; looked up, as if to &s;omebody, and &s;poke Engli&s;h. I have no doubt, though I was not pre&s;ent when &s;he a&s;&s;umed the&s;e airs, and talked Engli&s;h, but her di&s;ordered imagination brought before her her tutor in&s;tructing her in that tongue.</P>
<P>You de&s;ired me, Sir, to be very particular. I have been &s;o; but at the expence of my eyes: And I &s;hall
<PB N="371" REF="374">
not wonder if your humane heart &s;hould be affected by my &s;ad tale.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Mrs. Beaumont &s;taid at Bologna twelve days, and then left the unhappy young Lady.</P>
<P>At taking leave, &s;he a&s;ked her, What commands &s;he had for her?&mdash;Love me, &s;aid &s;he, and pitty me; that is one. Another is (whi&s;pering her), you will &s;ee the Chevalier, perhaps, tho' I mu&s;t not.&mdash;Tell him, that his poor friend Clementina is &s;ometimes very unhappy!&mdash;Tell him, that &s;he &s;hall rejoice to &s;it next him in Heaven!&mdash;Tell him, that I &s;ay he can|not go thither, good man as he is, while he &s;huts his eyes to the truth.&mdash;Tell him, that I &s;hall take it very kindly of him, if he will not think of marrying till he acquaints me with it; and can give me a&s;&s;urance, that the Lady will love him as well as Somebody el&s;e would have done.&mdash;O Mrs. Beaumont! &s;hould the Chevalier Grandi&s;on marry a woman unworthy of him, what a di&s;grace would that be to me!</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on by this time had prepared every|thing for his journey to Paris. The friend he ho|noured with his Love, was arrived from the Levant, and the Archipelago. Thither, at his patron's re|que&s;t, he had accompanied Mr. Beauchamp, the amiable friend of both; and at parting, engaged to continue by Letter what had been the &s;ubject of their daily conver&s;ations, and tran&s;mit to him as many par|ticulars as he could obtain of Mr. Grandi&s;on's &s;enti|ments and behaviour, on every occa&s;ion; Mr. Beau|champ propo&s;ing him as a pattern to him&s;elf, that he might be worthy of the Credential Letters he had fur|ni&s;hed him with to every one whom he had thought de&s;erving of his own acquaintance, when he was in the parts which Mr. Beauchamp intended to vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="375">
To the care of the per&s;on &s;o much honoured by his confidence, Mr. Grandi&s;on left his agreeable ward, Mi&s;s Jervois; reque&s;ting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mrs. Beau|mont, who kindly promi&s;ed her in&s;pection; and with the goodne&s;s for which &s;he is &s;o eminently noted, performed her promi&s;e in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>He then made an offer to the Bi&s;hop to vi&s;it Bo|logna once more; but that not being accepted, he &s;et out for Paris.</P>
<P>It was not long before his father's death called him to England; and when he had been there a few weeks, he &s;ent for his ward and his friend.</P>
<P>But, my good Mi&s;s Byron, you will &s;ay, That I have not yet fully an&s;wered your la&s;t enquiry, relating to the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the unhappy Clementina.</P>
<P>I will briefly inform you of it.</P>
<P>When it was known, for certain, that Mr. Gran|di&s;on had actually left Italy, the family at Bologna began to wi&s;h that they had permitted the interview &s;o much de&s;ired by the poor Lady: And when they afterwards under&s;tood that he was &s;ent for to England, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his paternal e&s;tate, that farther di&s;tance (the notion likewi&s;e of the &s;eas between them appearing formidable) added to their regrets.</P>
<P>The poor Lady was kept in travelling motion to quiet her mind: For &s;till an interview with Mr. Gran|di&s;on having never been granted, it was her fir&s;t wi&s;h.</P>
<P>They carried her to Urbino, to Rome, to Naples; then back to Florence, then to Milan, to Turin.</P>
<P>Whether they made her hope that it was to meet with Mr. Grandi&s;on, I know not; but it is certain, &s;he her&s;elf expected to &s;ee him at the end of every journey; and, while &s;he was moving, was ea&s;ier, and more compo&s;ed; perhaps in that hope.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s was &s;ometimes of the party. The air and exerci&s;e were thought proper for <HI>her</HI> health, as well as for that of her daughter. Her
<PB N="373" REF="376">
cou&s;in Laurana was always with her in the&s;e excur|&s;ions, and &s;ometimes Lady Sforza; and their e&s;corte was, generally, Signors Seba&s;tiano and Juliano.</P>
<P>But, within the&s;e four months pa&s;t, the&s;e journey|ings have been di&s;continued. The young Lady ac|cu&s;es them of deluding her with vain hopes. She is impatient, and has made two attempts to e&s;cape from them.</P>
<P>She is, for this rea&s;on, clo&s;ely confined, and watched.</P>
<P>They put her once into a nunnery, at the motion of Lady Sforza, as for a trial only. She was not un|ea&s;y in it: But this being done unknown to the Ge|neral, when he was appri&s;ed of it, he, for rea&s;ons I cannot comprehend, was di&s;plea&s;ed, and had her taken out, directly.</P>
<P>Her head runs more than ever upon &s;eeing her tu|tor, her friend, her Chevalier, once more. They have certainly been to blame, if they have let her tra|vel with &s;uch hopes; becau&s;e they have thereby kept up her ardor for an interview. Could &s;he but once more &s;ee him, &s;he &s;ays, and let him know the cru|elty &s;he has been treated with, &s;he &s;hould be &s;atisfied. <HI>He</HI> would pity her, &s;he is &s;ure, tho' nobody el&s;e will.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop has written to beg, that Sir Charles would pay them one more vi&s;it at Bologna.</P>
<P>I will refer to my patron him&s;elf the communi|cating to you, Ladies, his re&s;olution on this &s;ubject. I had but a moment's &s;ight of the Letters which &s;o greatly affected him.</P>
<P>It is but <HI>within</HI> the&s;e few days pa&s;t that this new re|que&s;t has been made to him in a <HI>direct</HI> manner. The que&s;tion was before put, If &s;uch a reque&s;t <HI>&s;hould</HI> be made, would he comply? And once Camilla wrote, as having heard Sir Charles's pre&s;ence wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>Mean-time the poor Lady is ha&s;tening, they are afraid, into a con&s;umptive malady. The Count of Belvedere, however, &s;till adores her. The di&s;order
<PB N="374" REF="377">
in her mind being imputed chiefly to religious melan|choly, and &s;ome of her particular flights not being ge|nerally known, he, who is a pious man him&s;elf, pities her; and declares, that he would run all ri&s;ques of her recovery, would the family give her to him: And yet he knows, that &s;he would choo&s;e to be the wife of the Chevalier Grandi&s;on rather than that of any other man, were the article of religion to be got over; and generou&s;ly applauds her for preferring her Faith to her Love.</P>
<P>Signor Jeronymo is in a very bad way. Sir Charles often writes to him, and with an affection worthy of the merits of that dear friend. He was to undergo another &s;evere operation on the next day after the Let|ters came from Bologna; the &s;ucce&s;s of which was very doubtful.</P>
<P>How nobly does Sir Charles appear to &s;upport him|&s;elf under &s;uch heavy di&s;tre&s;&s;es! For tho&s;e of his friends were ever his. But his heart bleeds in &s;ecret for them. A feeling heart is a ble&s;&s;ing that no one, who has it, would be without; and it is a moral &s;e|curity of innocence; &s;ince the heart that is able to par|take of the di&s;tre&s;s of another, cannot wilfully give it.</P>
<P>I think, my good Mi&s;s Byron, that I have now, as far as I am pre&s;ent able, obeyed all your commands that concern the unhappy Clementina, and her family. I will defer, if you plea&s;e tho&s;e which relate to Olivia and Mrs. Beaumont, Ladies of very different cha|racters from each other, having &s;everal Letters to write.</P>
<P>Permit me, my good Ladies, and my Lord, after contributing &s;o much to afflict your worthy hearts, to refer you, for relief under all the de&s;tre&s;&s;es of life, whether they affect our&s;elves or others, to tho&s;e mo|tives that can alone give true &s;upport to a rational mind. This mortal &s;cene, however perplexing, is a very &s;hort one; and the hour is ha&s;tening when all
