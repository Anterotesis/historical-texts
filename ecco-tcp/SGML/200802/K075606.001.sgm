<HEAD>TO THE REVEREND THOMAS PERCY, D.D. DEAN OF CARLISLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN the&s;e MISCELLANIES are in&s;cribed to a PERCY, I place them under the mo&s;t au&s;picious &s;helter. THE RELIQUES OF ANCIENT POETRY, with which you obliged the world in your younger years, would, independent of all other claims, have pointed you out as a proper Patron to the&s;e Fugitive Remains. But, excellent as your own Publications are, it is neither to them, nor to your elevated Station in Life, that I pay this di&s;intere&s;ted Tribute.</P>
<P>Happy in a Family Connexion, which, how|ever remotely, entitles me to claim Relation&s;hip with the Poet CLEIVELAND (extracts from who&s;e Works will add merit to a future volume
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
of this Collection); I am proud to have it known that the DEAN OF CARLISLE derives his de&s;cent from the &s;ame Family, his father's mother having been niece to the Bard above|mentioned: a Family di&s;tingui&s;hed in private life for having produced a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t excellent Clergymen, treading in the &s;teps of their venerable Ance&s;tor, the Rev. THOMAS CLEIVELAND, father of the Poet, who is upon record<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See "Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy," p. 221.</NOTE> for his very worthy character and mo&s;t exemplary life.</P>
<P>That urbanity, Sir, with which you recog|nized me as of kin to you, and the Friend&s;hip I have &s;ince in con&s;equence experienced from you, as they have made an indelible impre&s;&s;ion, demand the warm acknowledgements with which the&s;e volumes are mo&s;t re&s;pectfully pre&s;ented by,</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Collection, though formed principally from that of Mr. DRYDEN, is by no means a mere republication; which would now have been particularly ill-timed, as a large portion of that excellent Mi&s;cellany (the fir&s;t which appeared in this kingdom with reputation) is very properly arranged among the
"Works of the Engli&s;h Poets;" and &s;ome pages had crept into DRYDEN's Collection, which may be permitted to peri&s;h without regret.
There &s;till, however, are an infinite number of &s;mall poems, which, coming under neither of the&s;e de&s;criptions, mu&s;t be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s con|&s;iderable merit; being the productions of men of real genius, who, from the brevity rather than the inferiority of their writings, have been u&s;ually &s;tyled "Minor Poets."</P>
<P>On DRYDEN's foundation the pre&s;ent &s;uper|&s;tructure is begun. In its progre&s;s, almo&s;t every un|dertaking of a &s;imilar nature has been con&s;ulted, and material parts incorporated. The Collections formed by FENTON and STEELE have been epitomized; whil&s;t POPE's, PEMBERTON's, LINTOT's, and
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
C. TOOKE's, have occa&s;ionally contributed to embelli&s;hment.</P>
<P>The Collection by Mr. R. DODSLEY is allowed to be the complete&s;t of the kind; and with this the pre&s;ent publication is &s;o far from interfering, that not a &s;ingle poem is intended to be printed, which is either in "DODSLEY's Collection," the Supplement to it by Mr. PEARCH, or in the Sixty Volumes of the "Engli&s;h Poets." To all or either of the&s;e, therefore, this Selection will be a &s;uitable appen|dage; and the more &s;o, as I have pre&s;erved &s;ome poems of merit, which before were not known to have exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>The Reader will find in the&s;e volumes &s;ome of the earlie&s;t productions of DRYDEN; &s;ome originals by Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE; an Ode by SWIFT, which had long been con&s;idered as irrecoverable; a con&s;iderable number of good poems by STEELE, PARNELL, FENTON, BROOME, and YALDEN, with a few pieces by HALIFAX, DORSET, RO|CHESTER, SPRAT, PRIOR<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following anecdotes of this excellent Poet being curious, I print them in the words of the friend from whom they are received:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"At lord Oxford's &s;eat at Wimple (now lord Hardwicke's) there hung a fine picture of Harley in his Speaker's robes, with the roll of the bill in his hand for bringing-in the pre&s;ent family; which, if I mi&s;take not, was done by his ca&s;ting vote. In allu&s;ion to Harley's being afterwards &s;ent to The Tower, Prior wrote with a pencil on the white &s;croll, <HI>Bill paid &s;uch a day.</HI>&mdash;The late Recorder of Cambridge [Pont] had &s;een &s;ome MS. Dialogues of the Dead of Prior's; they were pro&s;e, but had ver&s;e intermixed freely: and the &s;pecimen, I heard, proved it. The Dialogue was between Sir Thomas More and the Vicar of Bray. You mu&s;t allow that the cha|racters are well cho&s;en; and the &s;peakers maintain their re&s;pective opinions &s;martly: at la&s;t the Knight &s;eems to come over to his adver&s;ary, at lea&s;t &s;o far as to allow that the doctrine was convenient, if not honourable; but that he did not &s;ee how any man could allow him&s;elf to act thus: when the Vicar concludes; Nothing ea&s;ier, with proper management; &amp;c.
You mu&s;t go the right way to work&mdash;
<Q><L>" For Con&s;cience, like a fiery hor&s;e,</L>
<L>" Will &s;tumble, if you check his cour&s;e:</L>
<L>" But ride him with an ea&s;y rein,</L>
<L>" And rub him down with worldly gain,</L>
<L>" He'll carry you through thick and thin,</L>
<L>" Safe, although dirty, to your inn."</L></Q></Q>
This certainly is &s;terling &s;en&s;e.&mdash;It would give me great plea&s;ure to be enabled to pre&s;ent the&s;e Dialogues to the world; but where they are now depo&s;ited is unknown.</NOTE>, POPE, BOLING-BROKE,
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
PHILIPS, KING, SMITH, WATTS, PITT, HUGHES, A. PHILIPS, and TICKELL, which are not to be found in any edition of their works.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">The a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome intelligent friends has enabled me to add a biographical account of almo&s;t every Writer here &s;elected; and their per&s;ua&s;ions have induced me to lay before the publick FOUR VOLUMES, as part of the plan I have undertaken. Two others are actually in the pre&s;s. There are &s;till an infinite number of Collections, which, amid&s;t a chaos of weeds, would afford a con|&s;iderable quantity of flowers well worth the tran&s;|planting. But the encouragement the&s;e meet with mu&s;t determine whether the publication &s;hall cea&s;e at the end of the SIXTH volume, or be extended &s;till farther. Without any great idea of emolument, which in this ca&s;e is far from being the principal object, I am unwilling to &s;acrifice the little lei&s;ure of a laborious life in a pur&s;uit that I have not rea&s;on to think will in &s;ome &s;mall degree contribute to <Q REND="inline">"the public &s;tock of harmle&s;s plea&s;ure."</Q></P>
<P>To my concluding volume &s;hall be annexed a complete POETICAL INDEX. In the mean time, for the convenience of the Reader, a &s;hort Index to the Notes will follow this Adverti&s;ement.</P>

<HEAD>SAPPHO TO PHAON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This epi&s;tle, after having appeared in a variety of collec|tions, was placed at the beginning of Garth's edition of
"Ovid's Epi&s;tles, by &s;everal hands," 1720;
where it is followed by another tran&s;lation of it by Mr. Pope; undertaken, as that great poet expre&s;sly &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not from any &s;uppo&s;ed defect in Sir Carr's tran&s;lation,"</Q> but becau&s;e he had not taken the whole of the original.
N.</NOTE></HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE HON. SIR CARR SCROPE<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Son of Sir Adrian Scrope, of Cockrington in Lincoln|&s;hire, knight. He became a gentleman commoner of Wad|ham College in 1664; was created a baronet Jan. 16, 1666; and took the degree of M.A. on the fourth of Fe|bruary following. His poems are not numerous; con&s;i&s;ting principally of tran&s;lations and lampoons. In his
"Defence of Satire,"
we are told by Anthony Wood, there are reflec|tions on,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"1. John earl of Roche&s;ter; 2. Edward Griffin; 3. Wroth the page; 4. Franc. Newport; 5. Lord Cul|pepper; 6. Henry Savil; 7. James duke of Monmouth; 8. Tho. Arm&s;trong; 9.&mdash;Loftus; 10. Brandon Ger|rard; 11. Jermyn earl of St. Albans; 12. Finch lord chan|cellor."</Q>
This produced, as might have been expected, the keene&s;t re&s;entment of Roche&s;ter (&s;ee his Poems, 1779, p. 340). Sir Carr tran&s;lated the fourth elegy of Ovid's fir&s;t book, and "The Parting of Sireno and Diana;" wrote the Prologue to Lee's "Rival Queens," and to
"The Man of Mode;" and &s;everal &s;ongs introduced into the plays of tho&s;e times.
He died, in the pari&s;h of St. Martin in the Fields, in or about November, 1680. He is mentioned with re&s;pect by Dr. King, Poems, p. 271. Wood refers to a MS Song "on Scrope, Godolphin, and Dor&s;et," in Mr. Sheldon's Library.
"The Parting of Sireno and Di|ana," Wood &s;ays, was tran&s;lated from the third book of Ovid's Elegies; but it is more probably from an Italian ori|ginal.

<HEAD>ON MR. WALLER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR THOMAS HIGGONS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Dr. Thomas Higgons, &s;ome time rector of We&s;t|burgh in Shrop&s;hire. He was born in that county; became a commoner of St. Albans Hall in the beginning of the year 1638, at the age of 14; when he was put under the tuition of Mr. Edward Corbet, fellow of Merton College, and lodged in the chamber under him in that hou&s;e. Leaving the univer|&s;ity without a degree, he retired to his native county. He married the widow of Robert earl of E&s;&s;ex; and delivered an oration at her funeral, Sept. 16, 1656.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Oratio &s;unebri, a marito ip&s;o, more pri&s;co laudata fuit,"</Q> is part of this lady's epitaph.
He married, &s;econdly, Bridget daughter of Sir Be|vil Greenvill of Stow, and &s;i&s;ter to John earl of Bath; and removed to Grewell in Hamp&s;hire; was elected a burge&s;s for Malm&s;bury in 1658, and for New Wind&s;or in 1661. His &s;ervices to the crown were rewarded with a pen&s;ion of 500&pound;. a year, and gifts to the amount of 4000&pound;. He was afterwards knighted; and in 1669 was &s;ent envoy extraordi|nary to inve&s;t John George duke of Saxony with the order of the Garter. About four years after he was &s;ent envoy to Vi|enna, where he continued three years. In 1685 he was elected burge&s;s for St. Germain's, "being then," &s;ays Wood,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"accounted a loyal and accompli&s;hed per&s;on, and a great lo|ver of the regular clergy."</Q>
He died &s;uddenly, of an apo|plexy, in the king's-bench court, having been &s;ummoned there as a witne&s;s, November 24, 1691; and was buried in Winche&s;|ter cathedral near the relicks of his fir&s;t wife. His literary productions are, 1. "A Panegyric to the King, 1660." fol. 2. "The Funeral Oration on his fir&s;t Lady, 1656." 3.
"The Hi&s;tory of I&s;oof Ba&s;&s;a, 1684."
He al&s;o tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h "The Venetian Triumph;" for which he was com|plimented by Waller, in his Poems, p. 113; who has al&s;o addre&s;&s;ed a poem to <HI>Mrs.</HI> Higgons, p. 201. Mr. Granger, who &s;tyles Sir Thomas <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a gentleman of great merit,"</Q> was favoured by the dutche&s;s dowager of Portland with a manu|&s;cript copy of his Oration; and concludes, from the great &s;carcity of that pamphlet, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the copies of it were, for certain rea&s;ons, indu&s;triou&s;ly collected and de&s;troyed, though few pieces of this kind have le&s;s de&s;erved to peri&s;h. The counte&s;s of E&s;&s;ex had a greatne&s;s of mind which enabled her to bear the whole weight of infamy which was thrown upon her; but it was, neverthele&s;s, attended with a delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility of honour which poi&s;oned all her enjoyments. Mr. Higgons had &s;aid much, and I think, much to the purpo&s;e, in her vin|dication: and was him&s;elf fully convinced from the te|nor of her life, and the words which the &s;poke at the awful clo&s;e of it, that the was perfectly innocent.&mdash;In reading this intere&s;ting oration, I fancied my&s;elf &s;tanding by the grave of injured innocence and beauty; was &s;en|&s;ibly touched with the pious affection of the tendere&s;t and be&s;t of hu&s;bands doing public and &s;olemn ju&s;tice to an ami|able and worthy woman, who had been gro&s;sly and pub|licly defamed. Nor could I with-hold the tribute of a tear; a tribute which, I am confident, was paid at her in|terment by every one who loved virtue, and was not de&s;ti|tute of the feelings of humanity. This is what I immedi|ately wrote upon reading the oration. If I am wrong in my opinion, the benevolent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ader, I am &s;ure, will forgive me. It is not the fir&s;t time that my heart has got the better of my judgment."</Q>
I am not afraid of being cen|&s;ured for having tran&s;cribed this beautiful pa&s;&s;age. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>TO THE DUKE, ON HIS RETURN. <DATE>1682.</DATE></HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY NATHANAEL LEE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This celebrated dramatic poet was the &s;on of a clergy|man, and bred at We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool under the famous Dr. Bu&s;by, whence he removed to Trinity college in Cambridge; became &s;cholar upon that foundation in 1668, and pro|ceeded A.B. the &s;ame year; but not &s;ucceeding to a fellow|&s;hip, he quitted the univer&s;ity, and came to London, where he made an un&s;ucce&s;sful attempt to become an actor in 1672. The part he performed was Duncan in Sir William Dave|nant's alteration of Macbeth. Failing in this de&s;ign, he had recour&s;e to his pen for a &s;upport, and, having a genius for the drama, he compo&s;ed a tragedy called "Nero emperor of Rome," in 1675, which being well received, he pu&s;hed on the &s;ame way, producing a new play almo&s;t every year one with another, till 1681. Though un&s;ucce&s;sful in his performance on the &s;tage, yet it is ob&s;erved by Cibber, that he read his pieces with a degree of excellence which a&s;toni&s;hed the mo&s;t ca|pital actors of that age. Mr. Lee was not only carele&s;s in his oeconomy, a foible incident to the poetic race, but raki&s;hly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ravagant: to that degree, as to be frequently plunged into the lowe&s;t depths of mi&s;ery: his wit and genius were al&s;o of the &s;ame unlucky turn, turgid, unbridled, and apt to break the bounds of &s;en&s;e. Thus gifted by nature, he left the reins loo&s;e to his imagination, till at length indigence and poetical enthu&s;ia&s;m tran&s;ported him into madne&s;s; &s;o that, in November 1684, he was taken into Bedlam, where he continued four years under the care of the phy&s;icians. He was di&s;charged in April 1688, being &s;o much recovered as to be able to return to his occupation of writing for the &s;tage. And he produced two plays afterwards,
"The Prince&s;s of Cleve," in 1689, and "The ma&s;&s;acre of Paris," the fol|lowing year.
However, notwith&s;tanding the profits ari&s;ing from the&s;e performances, he was this year reduced to &s;o low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n ebb, that a weekly &s;tipend of ten &s;hillings from the thea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re royal was his chief dependance. He was not &s;o clear of his phrenzy, as not to &s;uffer &s;ome temporary relap&s;es, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erhaps his untimely end might be occa&s;ioned by one. He died this year, 1690, as it is &s;aid, in a drunken frolic, by night in the &s;treet, and was interred in the pari&s;h of St. Cle|ment Danes, near Temple-bar. He is the author of eleven plays, all acted with applau&s;e, and printed as &s;oon as fini&s;hed, with dedications of mo&s;t of them to the earls of Dor&s;et, Mul|grave, Pembroke, the duche&s;&s;es of Port&s;mouth and Rich|mond, as his patrons. Mr. Addi&s;on declares, that, among our modern Engli&s;h poets, there was none better turned for tragedy than our author, if, in&s;tead of favouring the impe|tuo&s;ity of his genius, he had re&s;trained it, and kept it within proper bounds. His thoughts are wonderfully &s;uited to tra|gedy, but frequently lo&s;t in &s;uch a cloud of words, that it is hard to &s;ee the beauty of them. There is an infinite fire in his works, but &s;o involved in &s;moke, that it does not appear in half its lu&s;tre. He frequently &s;ucceeds in the pa&s;&s;ionate parts of the tragedy, but more particularly where he &s;lackens his efforts, and ea&s;es the &s;tyle of tho&s;e epithets and meta|phors in which he &s;o much abounds. His "Rival Queens," and "Theodo&s;ius or the Force of Love," &s;till keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage. The&s;e plays excel in moving the pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pe|cially that univer&s;al one, love. He is &s;aid to be particularly a ma&s;ter in that art, and for that rea&s;on has been compared to Ovid among the ancients, and to Otway among the mo|derns. Mr. Dryden prefixed a copy of commendatory ver&s;es to the Rival Queens, and our author joined with that laureat in writing the tragedy of the Duke of Gui&s;e and that of Oe|dipus. The&s;e particulars are extracted principally from the Biographical Dictionary. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<L>And as a prince has right his arms to wield,</L>

<HEAD>ARIADNE'S COMPLAINT, UPON A ROCK IN THE ISLAND OF NAXOS ON BEING DESERTED BY THESEUS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY WILLIAM CARTWRIGHT<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of Thomas Cartwright, of Burford, in Oxford&s;hire, was born Aug. 16, 1615. This is the account given by Lloyd. But Wood, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed well-informed, &s;ays, he was the &s;on of a gentleman of broken fortune, who was re|duced to keep an inn at Cirence&s;ter, in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire; was born at Northway, near Tewk&s;bury, in September, 1611; and received the early part of his education at Cirence&s;ter Free-&s;chool: being placed as a king's &s;cholar at We&s;tmin&s;ter, he was elected to Chri&s;t Church, Oxford, in 1628, where he took the degree of M.A. in 1635. The &s;ame writer informs us,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he went through the cla&s;&s;es of Logick and Philo&s;ophy with an unwearied indu&s;try, took holy orders, and became the mo&s;t florid and &s;craphical preacher in the univer&s;ity. He was another Tully and Virgil, as being mo&s;t excellent for Oratory and Poetry; in which faculties, as al&s;o in the Greek tongue, he was &s;o full and ab&s;olute, that tho&s;e that be&s;t knew him, knew not in which he mo&s;t excelled. So admirably well ver&s;ed al&s;o was he in Metaphy&s;icks, that when he was Reader of them in the Univer&s;ity, the ex|po&s;ition of them was never better performed than by him and his predece&s;&s;or Thomas Barlow, of Queen's College. His preaching al&s;o was &s;o graceful, and profound withal, that none of his time or age went beyond him. So that, if the Wits read his Poems, Divines his Sermons, and Philo&s;ophers his Lectures on Ari&s;totle's Metaphy&s;icks, they would &s;carcely believe that he died at a little above thirty years of age. But that which is mo&s;t remarkable is, that the&s;e his high parts and abilities were accompanied with &s;o much candour and &s;weetne&s;s, that they made him equally beloved and admired of all per&s;ons, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Gown and Court; who e&s;teemed al&s;o his life a fair copy of practic piety, a rare example of heroic worth, and in whom Arts, Learning, and Language, made up the true complement of perfection."</Q>
In 1642 bi&s;hop Duppa ap|pointed him to be &s;uccentor in the church of Sali&s;bury, and in 1643 he was cho&s;en junior proctor of the univer&s;ity. He was al&s;o metaphy&s;ical reader to the univer&s;ity. Ben Jon&s;on &s;aid of him, <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on Cartwright writes like a man!"</Q> There are extant, of this author's, four plays, be&s;ides other poems, which were printed together in 1651, accompanied by above fifty copies of commendatory ver&s;es by the wits of the univer&s;ity. A. Wood tells us, Mr. Cartwright wrote al&s;o, 1. Po&euml;mata Graeca et Latina. 2. An offspring of mercy i&s;&s;uing out of the womb of cruelty: a pa&s;&s;ion &s;ermon, preached at Chri&s;t Church in Oxford, on Acts ii. 23. 3. On the &s;ignal days in the month of November, in relation to the crown and royal family: a poem. 4. Poems and ver&s;es containing airs for &s;everal voices, &s;et by Mr. Henry Lawes. His "Royal Slave" was acted before the king and queen by his fellow-&s;tudents of Chri&s;t Church; of whom the mo&s;t applauded was Mr. Bu&s;by, afterwards the celebrated ma&s;ter of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool. Wit, learning, judgement, elocution, a graceful per&s;on and behaviour, occa&s;ioned that well-known encomium of him from dean Fell,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That he was the utmo&s;t man could come to."</Q>
This in&s;tance of the perfection of human nature was al&s;o an in&s;tance of its vanity. He was &s;uddenly &s;natched away by a fever, in the prime of life, on the twenty-ninth of November, 1643; and had the honour to be regretted by his &s;overeign and his queen, who were in Oxford at the time of his death. See Wood and Granger. Jacob &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cartwright was a king's &s;cholar at Eton under Dr. Olba&s;ton; eminent for learning and loyalty; an excellent &s;cholar, and an admirable poet; expert in the Latin, Greek, French, and Italian languages.</Q>
The wits of Oxford prefixed recommendatory ver&s;es to his Works.&mdash;After &s;uch eulogiums, it &s;eems a kind of poetical bla&s;phemy to annex the opinion of Dr. King, who &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Cartwright's poems &s;eem to me very indifferent!"</Q> N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

Fonte|nelle's Hi&s;tory of Oracles, and Plurality of Worlds, to which la&s;t &s;he annexed an e&s;&s;ay on tran&s;lation and tran&s;lated pro&s;e. The paraphra&s;e of Oenone's epi&s;tle to Paris, in the Engli&s;h tran&s;lation of Ovid's epi&s;tles, is Mrs. Behn's; and Mr. Dry|den, in his preface to that work, pays her the following compliment:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I was de&s;ired to &s;ay, that the author, who is of the fair &s;ex, under&s;tood not Latin; but if &s;he does not, I am afraid &s;he has given us occa&s;ion to be a&s;hamed who do."</Q>
She was al&s;o the authore&s;s of the celebrated letters between a nobleman and his &s;i&s;ter, printed in London, 1684; and we have extant of hers eight love-letters, to a gentle|man whom &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately loved, and with whom &s;he cor|re&s;ponded under the name of Lycidas. They are printed in the life and memoirs of Mrs. Behn, prefixed to her hi&s;tories and novels. She died, after a long indi&s;po&s;ition, April 16, 1689, and was buried in the Cloi&s;ters in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey. There are &s;everal encomiums on Mrs. Behn prefixed to her "Lover's Watch;" and Mr. Gildon, who was inti|mately acquainted with our poete&s;s, &s;peaks of her in the highe&s;t terms. Dr. King tells us,
<Q><L>" A&s;traea's lines flow on with &s;o much ea&s;e,</L>
<L>" That &s;he who writes like her mu&s;t &s;urely plea&s;e."</L></Q>
Yet, plea&s;ing as they may be, the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of her dra|matic pieces occa&s;ioned the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of Mr. Pope:

At 17 years of age, he was a fellow commoner of Wadham college, Oxford; and returned to his own country without taking any degree At the Re|&s;toration, he came to London; commenced wit, courtier, poet, and gallant; and was &s;o much e&s;teemed as to be a kind of oracle among the poets. Whil&s;t the reputation of his wit increa&s;ed, he became poor and debauched, his e&s;tate was impaired, and his morals much corrupted. In 1663, being fined five hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ounds for a riot in Bow-&s;treet, he became more &s;erious, and applied to politicks.&mdash;His daughter Catha|rine, having been mi&s;tre&s;s to James II. before he a&s;cended the throne, was created counte&s;s of Dorche&s;ter, Jan. 2, 1685; and, on that king's abdication, &s;he married the earl of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|more.

Among<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them is a comedy called "The Mulberry Garden," acted at the Theatre Royal 1668.

<HEAD>THE COMPLAINT OF ARIADNE.</HEAD>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The poet, in the epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis, de&s;cribes the genial bed, on which was wrought the &s;tory of The&s;eus and Ariadne; and on that occa&s;ion makes a long digre&s;&s;ion, part of which is the &s;ubject of the following poem.</P>

<L>With longing eyes, but all alas in vain!</L>
<L>The winged bark o'er the tempe&s;tuous main;</L>
<L>For buried in fallacious &s;leep &s;he lay,</L>

<L>Regardle&s;s of her fate who &s;av'd his youth;</L>
<L>Winds bore away his promi&s;e and his truth.</L>
<L>Like &s;ome wild Bacchanal unmov'd &s;he &s;tood,</L>
<L>And with fix'd eyes &s;urvey'd the raging flood.</L>
<L>There with alternate waves the &s;ea does roll,</L>
<L>Nor le&s;s the tempe&s;ts that di&s;tract her &s;oul;</L>
<L>Abandon'd to the winds her flowing hair,</L>
<L>Rage in her &s;oul expre&s;t, and wild de&s;pair:</L>
<L>Her ri&s;ing brea&s;ts with indignation &s;well,</L>

See the prologue to this tragedy in Lord Lan&s;downe's Poems, p. 220. He was a &s;teady adherent to the cau&s;e of the exiled family; and ac|companied K.

<BYLINE>BY THE HON. SIR ROBERT HOWARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A younger &s;on of Thomas earl of Berk&s;hire, and edu|cated at Magdalen College in Oxford. During the civil wars he was a zealous royali&s;t; and was knighted at the Re&s;tora|tion, and rewarded by the office of auditor of the exchequer. He was cho&s;en member for Stockbridge in 1661; and for Ca&s;tle Ri&s;ing in 1679 and 1688. He was &s;o &s;trong an ad|vocate for the Revolution, as to di&s;claim all manner of con|ver&s;ation with the Nonjurors; and, by his ob&s;tinacy and pride, made many enemies. His patron the duke of Buck|ingham had in 1663 expo&s;ed him under the name of <HI>Bilboa</HI> in "The Rehear&s;al;" but afterwards altered his re&s;olution, and leveled his ridicule at a much greater name, under that of <HI>Bayes.</HI> He was al&s;o ridiculed in Shadwell's
"Sullen Lovers." 1670, under the name of <HI>Sir Po&s;itive At-all.</HI>
He publi&s;hed &s;ix plays, a volume of poems, and &s;ome treati&s;es in pro&s;e; was four times married; and died Sept. 3, 1698.&mdash;In Dryden, vol. II. p. 117, is a beautiful epi&s;tle

He was the alchemi&s;t and the philo&s;opher; the fiddler and the poet; the mimic and the &s;tate&s;man. He has left us a &s;pecimen of his admirable wit in "The Rehear&s;al," which had a con&s;iderable effect in reforming the &s;tage. It was fini&s;hed before the end of 1664; but the great plague and other accidents prevented its being acted before 1671. He is &s;aid to have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this comedy by Dr. Spratt, Mr. Clifford, and the celebrated author of Hudibras.&mdash;The duke was born Jan. 30, 1627, the year before his fa|ther's a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. After many &s;ufferings in the royal cau&s;e, he &s;olicited one of the daughters of Cromwell in mar|riage; but was mortified with a denial. He afterwards mar|ried the only daughter of lord Fairfax, and was &s;oon commit|ted to The Tower by the protector. On the Re&s;toration, he was at fir&s;t &s;lighted by the king; but the charms of his wit and conver&s;ation &s;oon prevailed, and he was appointed a lord of the bed-chamber. In May 1668, he purcha&s;ed the office of ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e; was in&s;talled chancellor of Cambridge, June 7, 1671, and deprived of that office in 1674. He died, in contempt and mi&s;ery, April 16, 1688; a melancholy ex|ample of the pro&s;titution of talents. His end is pathetically de&s;cribed in Mr. Pope's Epi&s;tle to Lord Bathur&s;t.

<BYLINE>PARAPHRASED BY DR. WALTER POPE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Half-brother to Bp. Wilkins. He was born at Faw&s;ley in Northampton&s;hire, and elected from We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool to Trinity College, Cambridge, 1645. He was afterward a &s;cholar of Wadham College, Oxford, where he took the de|gree of B.A. July 6, 1649; was admitted probationer fel|low July 3, 1651; and commenced B.A. on the 10th of the &s;ame month. In 1658, being junior proctor, an attempt was made to abrogate the &s;tatute for wearing caps and hoods. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s was fru&s;trated by his firmne&s;s, which he called
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the mo&s;t glorious action of his life."</Q>
While Mr. Pope was in his proctor&s;hip, Mr. Sprat (afterwards bi&s;hop) addre&s;&s;ed to him "The Plague of Athens;" which fixes the date of that poem to 1658. He was appointed dean of Wadham College in 1660; a&s;tronomy profe&s;&s;or in Gre&s;ham College, March 8, 1660-1; created doctor of phy&s;ic, Sept. 12, 1661; was ob|liged to give up his fellow&s;hip, June 27, 1662, as incompati|ble with the profe&s;&s;or&s;hip. He was cho&s;en one of the fir&s;t fel|lows of the Royal Society, May 20, 1663; and &s;oon after had licen&s;e to travel for two years, during which time he made the tour of Italy. After the great fire, Sept. 2, 1666, the principal lodgings in Gre&s;ham College were taken up by the lord mayor and other per&s;ons of note; but tho&s;e of Dr. Pope were pre&s;erved for the u&s;e of the profe&s;&s;ors and the Royal Society, who fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled there on Tue&s;day the 11th of that month, but &s;oon after removed to Arundel-Hou&s;e in the Strand. Dr. Pope was cho&s;en into the council of the Royal Society in 1667; and appointed regi&s;ter of the dioce&s;e of Che&s;ter, March 16, 1668. He publi&s;hed, in 1670,
"The Memoirs of Mon&s;ieur Du Vall, with his la&s;t Speech and Epitaph."
[Claude Du Vall, a native of Normandy, was a bri&s;k hand&s;ome fellow; but, being a notorious highway-man, was hanged at Tyburn, Jan. 21, 1669; and in this pamphlet the Doctor humourou&s;ly raillied the fa&s;hion, then prevalent among the ladies, of admiring Frenchmen.] In 1686, Dr. Pope had very nearly lo&s;t his &s;ight by an inflam|mation which had been of many years continuance; but was cured by Dr. Turbervill, as he hand&s;omely acknowledges in the epitaph he wrote on that eminent oculi&s;t. He re&s;igned his profe&s;&s;or&s;hip, Sept. 21, 1687; and in 1693 publi&s;hed "The Wi&s;h," a well-known little poem. On the 16th of November that year he lo&s;t all his books, by a fire in Lom|bard-&s;treet. He publi&s;hed the "Life of Bp. Ward in 1697;" and "Moral and Political Fables" in 1698. The next year he withdrew from the Royal Society, and re&s;ided principally at Ep&s;om; but &s;ettled at la&s;t in Buning-fields, in the &s;uburbs of London, where he died at a very advanced age, and was buried at Cripplegate Church, June 25, 1714. He wrote a copy of Ver&s;es upon Anne Green, who was executed at Ox|ford, Dec. 14, 1650; and afterwards revived. [A narrative of this fact was printed at Oxford in 1651, 4to. intituled, "News from the Dead, &amp;c.," reprinted in Morgan's
"Phoe|nix Britannicus."
See likewi&s;e in Heath's Chronicle, p. 278; Plot's Natural Hi&s;tory of Oxford&s;hire, p. 201; and Warton's "Life of Dr. Bathur&s;t." Sir Wm. Petty was one chiefly concerned in recovering her]. Dr. Pope was author of &s;everal humourous ballads, and of many &s;erious treati&s;es in pro&s;e; which are enumerated in Dr. Ward's Lives of the Gre&s;ham Profe&s;&s;ors; of which a valuable copy, with large MS additions by the author, is in The Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum.

<HEAD>SONG,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This celebrated wit was born near London about the year 1634; and, after receiving &s;ome part of his education at Cambridge, travelled into France and Flanders. At his return, he &s;tudied the law for &s;ome time; which he &s;oon ex|changed for the belles lettres, and commenced dramatic writer in 1664. His fir&s;t comedy,
"The Comical Re|venge," &s;ecured to him the general e&s;teem of the publick.
He was married young to a widow of con&s;iderable fortune, who would not con&s;ent to the match unle&s;s he could make her a lady by obtaining the honour of knighthood; which he applied for, and &s;ucceeded. His accompli&s;hments pro|cured him the favour of James the Second's queen, to whom (whil&s;t &s;he was only daughter of the duke of Modena) he had dedicated his "Man of Mode," 1676; and, by her in|tere&s;t and recommendation, he was &s;ent envoy to Hamburgh. On the Revolution he followed the fortunes of James II. and died either in France, or very &s;oon after his arrival in Eng|land from thence; but there was a report that he came to an untimely end by an accident in con&s;equence of inebriation after a &s;ocial dinner he had given to &s;ome friends at Rati&s;bon.

<HEAD>PART OF VIRGIL'S FOURTH GEORGICK.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. CREECH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Born near Sherborne in Dor&s;et&s;hire in 1659, and bred up at the Free-&s;chool in that town, under Mr. Curganven, to whom he gratefully in&s;cribed an Idyllium of Theocritus. He was &s;ent by Colonel Strangeways to Wadham College in Oxford, where he was admitted a &s;cholar on the foundation 1675, and took the degree of B.A. June 13, 1683. The reputation acquired by his Lucretius, which he publi&s;hed when very young, recommended him to All Souls College, where he was elected Fellow in 1689; proceeded B.D. March 18, 1696; and was pre&s;ented by that College to the living of Welwyn in Hertford&s;hire; but, through &s;ome di&s;|appointment either in love or in his expectations, laid violent hands on him&s;elf in 1701, before he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his living. "He was a man," &s;ays Jacob,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of excellent parts, &s;ound judgement, and perfectly ma&s;ter of the Greek and Latin languages; but naturally of a moro&s;e temper, and too apt to de&s;pi&s;e the under&s;tandings and performances of others. This made him le&s;s e&s;teemed than his great merit de&s;erved; and his re&s;entments on this account fre|quently engaged him in tho&s;e heats and di&s;putes which in the end proved fatal to him."</Q>
On his father's monument at Blandford, he is called
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The learned, much-admired, and much-envied Mr. Creech."</Q>&mdash;He tran&s;lated Lucretius, Theocritus, and Horace; &s;ome eclogues of Virgil; and &s;ome of the &s;atires of Juvenal. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<P>Ari&s;taeus, having lo&s;t his bees, goes by his mother's di|rection to Proteus, to know why the Gods had &s;ent this plague.

<BYLINE>BY LORD FALKLAND<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lucius Cary, elde&s;t &s;on of the fir&s;t lord vi&s;count of Falkland, was born about 1610; and received his academical learning fir&s;t at Trinity College Dublin, and then at St. John's Cambridge. He entered early into the &s;ervice of Charles I; and was &s;hot at the battle of Newbury, Sept. 20, 1643.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The character of Lord Falkland by the Earl of Clarendon is the complete&s;t, if not the fine&s;t, of any in his admirable hi&s;tory. He is repre&s;ented as an a&s;&s;emblage of almo&s;t every virtue and excellency that can dignify or adorn a man. This encomium is doubtle&s;s &s;omewhat ex|aggerated; but there &s;eems to be much truth in it with re&s;pect to the private part of his life, as it appears to have been taken from near and repeated views. A great man in public rather appears to be what it is his intere&s;t or in|clination to be thought, than what he is. The Earl of Clarendon, who knew Lord Falkland in private life, &s;eems therefore to have given us a ju&s;ter portrait of him than if he had &s;een him only in his public character. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that he has drawn him to great advantage: but we are not to impute this to the lea&s;t di&s;regard to truth, but to the amiable lights in which his friend&s;hip had placed him. A friend who draws the portrait of another friend, is apt to be&s;tow as much heightening upon it as a painter would in fini&s;hing the picture of his mi&s;|tre&s;s."</Q>
This extract from Mr. Granger is given without the mo&s;t di&s;tant inclination of
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"throwing a &s;hade on a virtue the brighte&s;t and pure&s;t that hath done honour to the&s;e later ages;"</Q> [&s;ee Bp. Hurd's excellent Dialogues, vol. I. p. 78.]&mdash;Before he was twenty-three years of age, he had read over all the Greek and Latin fathers, and was inde|fatigable in collecting books of value.
He has given &s;pecimens of his own abilities as a poet, a politician, and a polemic writer; but his
"Di&s;cour&s;e of the Infallibility of the Church of Rome," which is written in an ea&s;y and familiar &s;tyle, without the lea&s;t affectation of learning, is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his Works.
It is remarked by Doctor Swift, that in &s;ome of Lord Falkland's writings,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"when he doubted whether a word was perfectly intelligible or no, he u&s;ed to con&s;ult one of his lady's chambermaids (not the waiting-woman, becau&s;e it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he might be conver&s;ant in romances), and by her judgment was guided whether to receive or reject it."</Q>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF BEN JONSON<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ben Jon&s;on, a mo&s;t celebrated Engli&s;h poet in his time, died Aug. 6, 1637, in his 63d year. He is gene|rally repre&s;ented as &s;urly and moro&s;e by the writers of the pre&s;ent time, though, from the attention &s;hewn to him by his contemporaries, it might be &s;u&s;pected that the charge was not well founded. Certain it is that he died much lamented; and in the beginning of 1638 his memory was embalmed by the tears of the Mu&s;es, in a collection of elegies and poems under the title of
"Jon&s;onius Virbius, or The Memorie of Ben Jon&s;on revived by the Friends of the Mu&s;es."
In this collection were poems by mo&s;t of the men of genius of that age. One by Mr. Waller is in his Poems, p. 104; another by Cartwright in this volume, p. 63. Tho&s;e of the Lords Falkland and Buckhur&s;t, Bp. King, and Dr. Mayne, are here exhibited. Sir John Beaumont, Sir Thomas Hawkins, H. Coventry, T. May, D. Diggs, G. Forte&s;cue, W. Abington, J.

Warying the author of "Effigies Amoris," James Howel, and &s;ome others, employed their pens in this collection; which was publi&s;hed by Dr. Duppa, bi&s;hop of Chiche&s;ter, and tutor to Charles II. then prince of Wales.

He took the degrees of B. and M.A, and was pre&s;ented by the College to the livings of Ca&s;&s;ington and Pyrton in Oxford|&s;hire. In the civil wars he preached before the king at Ox|ford, and was made D.D.; but was &s;oon after ejected from his livings by Cromwell's vi&s;itors. He found an a&s;ylum with the Earl of Devon&s;hire; and at the Re&s;toration obtained his livings again, was made canon of Chri&s;t Church, arch|deacon of Chiche&s;ter, and chaplain to Charles II. He died December 6, 1672; and is called by Wood
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a quaint preacher and a noted poet."</Q>
Five only of his &s;ermons are in print, and his poems are not numerous. He publi&s;hed two plays; a poem on the Naval Victory over the Dutch by the Duke of York; tran&s;lated &s;ome of Lucian's Dialogues, 1638; and Donne's Latin Epigrams, 1652, which he called
"A Sheaf of Mi&s;cellany Epigrams."
Though very orthodox in his opinions, and &s;evere in his manners, he was a facetious companion, and his propen&s;ity to mirth attended him in his la&s;t moments; for to a &s;ervant who had lived long with him
he
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"bequeathed a trunk, with &s;omething in it to make him drink;"</Q> which being opened by the expecting &s;ervant, he found the legacy to be nothing but a red herring.

<HEAD>THYRSIS'S PRAISE TO HIS MISTRESS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MR. WILLIAM BROWNE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An excellent writer, who&s;e fate was as uncommon as it was unmerited. He who was admired and beloved by all the be&s;t writers of his time, who was e&s;teemed and highly recommended by the critical Jon&s;on and the learned Selden, was in a few years after his death almo&s;t forgotten. To the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o &s;mall credit of Mr. T. Davies, his writings were for the fir&s;t time completely collected in 1772, in three neat volumes, of a &s;ize which makes them a proper companion for the "Engli&s;h Poets," and con&s;equently renders it unnece&s;&s;ary to print here any more than a &s;pecimen of his poetry. But a few particulars of his life &s;hall be given in the words of Mr. Davies:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"William Browne, de&s;cended of a good family, was born at Tavi&s;tock in Devon&s;hire, in the year 1590; his father, according to Prince, in his "Worthies of Devon," being probably of the knightly family of Browne, of Browne's-Ila&s;h, in the pari&s;h of Langtree, near Great-Torrington. After he had pa&s;&s;ed through the Grammar-&s;chool, he was &s;ent to Exeter College in the Univer&s;ity of Oxford, about the beginning of the reign of king James the Fir&s;t, where he became a great proficient in cla&s;&s;ical learning, and in the Belles Lettres was &s;carcely equalled; from hence, however, before he had taken any academical degree, he removed to the Inner-Temple, London, where he more particularly devoted him&s;elf to the Mu&s;es. In the beginning of the year 1624, he returned again to Exeter College, and became tutor to Robert Dormer, who was af|terwards earl of Carnarvon, and who lo&s;t his life at New|bury Fight, on the 20th of September, 1643. On the 25th of March, 1624, our author received permi&s;&s;ion to be actu|ally created a Ma&s;ter of Arts, although the degree was not conferred upon him till the November following. He is &s;tyled, in the public regi&s;ter of the Univer&s;ity, a man well &s;killed in all kinds of polite literature and u&s;eful arts; <HI>vir omni human&acirc; literatur&acirc; et bonarum artium cognitione in|&s;tructus.</HI> After he had left College with his pupil, he was gladly received into the family of William earl of Pem|broke, who had a great re&s;pect for him; and here, ac|cording to the author of the Athenae Oxonien&s;es, he made his fortune &s;o well that he purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate; he al&s;o adds, that he had a great mind in a little body; but with regard to the time of his death, he is very doubtful, for all that he &s;ays of the matter is, that in his &s;earches he finds that one William Browne, of Ottery St. Mary in De|von&s;hire, died in the year 1645; but that he cannot tell whether he was the &s;ame with our poet."</Q>
To this ac|count I &s;hall only add that Mr. Warburton the herald ap|pears to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome MS. poems by this au|thor, which were &s;old, with the re&s;t of his library, about the year 1759 or 1760. I cannot but wi&s;h that Mr. Davies had met with &s;ufficient encouragement to have proceeded with the work he announced at the conclu&s;ion of his preface, under the title of "England's Helicon." He publi&s;hed, however, in the &s;ame &s;ize, the whole works of Suckling, in 1770, the poems of Marvell and Carew in 1772; and tho&s;e of Sir John Davies in 1773. A &s;mall portion, therefore, of each of the&s;e writers will be &s;ufficient for this collection. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>BY MR. JOHN SELDEN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This famous antiquary, de&s;cended from a good family, was born at Salvington in Su&s;&s;ex, December 16, 1585; edu|cated at Chiche&s;ter free-&s;chool, and admitted of Hart-Hall, Oxon, in 1598; removed to Clifford's Inn in 1602, to &s;tudy the law; admitted of the Inner Temple in May 1604. He &s;oon commenced writer; and publi&s;hed a con&s;iderable num|ber of valuable works, which it is needle&s;s here to enume|rate. In 1612 he publi&s;hed notes and illu&s;trations on the fir&s;t eighteen &s;ongs in
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his worthy friend Michael Dray|ton's"</Q>
Poly-Olbion, and the year after wrote ver&s;es in Greek, Latin, and Engli&s;h, upon Browne's
"Britannia's Pa&s;torals;" which, with divers poems prefixed to the works of other authors, occa&s;ioned Sir John Suckling to give him a place in his "Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets."
Mr. Selden, when not above three and thirty years of age, had &s;hewn him&s;elf a great philologi&s;t, ant'quary, herald, and lingui&s;t; and his name was &s;o wonderfully advanced, not only at home, but in foreign countries, that he was actually then, what he was afterwards u&s;ually &s;tyled, the great dictator of learning to the Engli&s;h nation. In 1618, when he was in his thirty-fourth year, he publi&s;hed his "Hi&s;tory of Tithes;" which alarming the clergy, and offending king James I, it was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the author forced to make public &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. He again offended that monarch in 1621, by an opinion he gave again&s;t the crown as coun&s;el in the hou&s;e of lords, and was committed into the cu&s;tody of the &s;heriff of London; but was relea&s;ed in five weeks by the favour of the lord keeper Williams. He was cho&s;en member for Lan|ca&s;ter that year; but neglected all public bu&s;ine&s;s to apply him&s;elf to &s;tudy. In 1624 he was appointed, by the Inner Temple, reader at Lyon's Inn; but refu&s;ed to accept that office. In 1625 he was cho&s;en burge&s;s for Great Bedwin, Wilt&s;hire, and again in 1626, when he was an active ma|nager again&s;t the duke of Buckingham. In 1627 he was coun&s;el for Mr. Hampden; and in the third parliament of king James was again elected for Lanca&s;ter, and had a con|&s;iderable hand in the Petition of Rights. After the proro|gation in June, retiring to Wre&s;t in Bedford&s;hire, he fini&s;hed his Commentaries on the Arundelian Marbles. In the next &s;e&s;&s;ion he warmly oppo&s;ed the court, and was committed to the Tower, and had his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy &s;ealed up, March 24, 1628. He was clo&s;ely confined three months, but magnificently &s;upported at the king's expence; and being afterwards al|lowed the u&s;e of &s;uch books as he de&s;ired, he proceeded in his &s;tudies. In Hilary Term, 1629, declining to give &s;e|curity for his good behaviour (as unwarrantable by law), he was committed to the King's Ben<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h pri&s;on. He was relea&s;ed the latter end of the year, though it does not appear how; only that the parliament in 1646 ordered him &pound;.5000. for the lo&s;&s;es he had &s;u&s;tained on that occa&s;ion. In 1630 he was again committed to cu&s;tody, with the earls of Bedford and Clare, Sir Robert Cotton, and Mr. St. John, being accu&s;ed of having di&s;per&s;ed a libel, intituled,
"A Propo&s;ition for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice to bridle the impertinency of Parlia|ments;" but it was proved that Sir Robert Dudley, their living in the duke of Tu&s;cany's dominions, was the author.
All the&s;e various impri&s;onments and tumults gave no inter|ruption to his &s;tudies; but he proceeded, in his old way, to write and publi&s;h books. In 1640 he was cho&s;en member of parliament for the Univer&s;ity of Oxford; and though he was again&s;t the court, yet in 1642 the king had thoughts of tak|ing the &s;eal from the lord keeper Littleton, and giving it to him. In 1643 he was appointed one of the lay-members to &s;it in the a&s;&s;embly of divines at We&s;tmin&s;ter, in which he frequently perplexed tho&s;e divines with his va&s;t learning. About this time he took the covenant; and the &s;ame year, 1643, was by the parliament appointed keeper of the records in the Tower. In 1644 he was elected one of the twelve commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty; and the &s;ame year was no|minated to the ma&s;ter&s;hip of Trinity College in Cambridge, which he did not think proper to accept. In the beginning of 1653 his health began to decline; and he died the 30th of November that year, at the Friary Hou&s;e in White-Friars, where he had re&s;ided for &s;ome years, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it in the right of Elizabeth counte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s dowager of Kent, who had appointed him executor of her will, having before, from the fir&s;t of her widowhood, committed the management of her affairs to him. He was buried in the Temple church, where a monume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t was erected to him. He left a mo&s;t valu|able and curious library to his executors; which they gene|rou&s;ly would have be&s;towed on the &s;ociety of the Inner Temple, if a proper place had been provided to receive it; but, this being neglected, they gave it to the Univer&s;ity of Oxford. A good edition of his Works was publi&s;hed by Dr. Wilkins, 1726, in three volumes, folio. N.</NOTE>.</BYLINE>

<HEAD>ON THE DEATH OF MR. SELDEN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY DR. BATHURST<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pre&s;ident of Trinity College, Oxford, and vice-chancellor of that Univer&s;ity.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Dr. Bathur&s;t, in the early part of his life, applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of divinity, in which he made a very con&s;iderable progre&s;s. But when he &s;aw that &s;ome churches were defaced or demoli&s;hed, and others con|verted into barracks and &s;tables, and that a learned mi|ni&s;try was held in the utmo&s;t contempt, he changed the cour&s;e of his &s;tudies, and applied him&s;elf to phy&s;ic. He took a doctor's degree in that faculty, in which he ro&s;e to &s;uch eminence, that he was, in the time of the U&s;urpation, appointed phy&s;ician to the &s;tate. Upon the Re&s;toration, he quitted his profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic, was elected a fell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w of the Royal Society, and pre&s;ident of his college: and having entered into holy orders, he was made chaplain to the king, and in&s;talled dean of Wells, June 28, 1670. His learning and talents were various: he was the orator and the poet, the philo&s;opher and the divine. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an inexhau&s;tible fund of writ, and was the facetious companion at eighty years of age. Ridicule was the weapon that he made u&s;e of to correct the deliquents of his college; and he was &s;o ab&s;olute a ma&s;ter of it, that he had it always at hand. His poetical pieces in the "Mu&s;ae Anglicanae" are excellent in their kind: they are much in the &s;pirit of Ovid, who was his favourite poet. His "Diatribae Theo|logicae" in manu&s;cript, which he began at twenty-three years of age, are much commended by Mr. Warton. He died greatly lamented by all that knew his worth, and particularly by the &s;ociety over which he pre&s;ided, the 14th of June, 1704, in the 84th year of his age."</Q>

<HEAD>VERSES</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY GEORGE CHAPMAN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This writer, who obtained much applau&s;e in his time, and was greatly prai&s;ed by his contemporaries, was born at Hitching-hill, in the county of Hertford, &s;ome time in the year 1557. After being well grounded in &s;chool-learning, he was &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity, but whether to Oxford or Cam|bridge was unknown to Anthony Wood, who declares him|&s;elf certain he re&s;ided &s;ome time at the former, where he was ob&s;erved to be mo&s;t excellent in the Latin and Greek tongues, but not in Logic or Philo&s;ophy, which may be pre&s;umed to be the rea&s;on he took no degree there. He appears to have been a man of a very re&s;pectable character, being countenanced and patronized by &s;everal eminent per&s;ons, particularly Sir Thomas Wal&s;yngham and his &s;on, and by Prince Henry, &s;on of James the Fir&s;t. Wood imagines that he was a &s;worn &s;ervant either to James the Fir&s;t or his Queen, and &s;ays he was highly valued, but not &s;o much as Ben Jon&s;on. The &s;ame writer adds, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was a per&s;on of mo&s;t reverend a&s;pect, religious and temperate qualities, rarely meeting in a poet."</Q>
After living to the age of 77 years, he died on the 12th day of May, 1634, in the pari&s;h of St. Giles in the Fields, and was buried on the South-&s;ide of the Church-yard there. His friend Inigo Jones erected a monument to his memory near the place of his interment. His tran&s;lation of Homer acquired him a con&s;iderable degree of reputation. Mr. Dryden tells us, that Waller u&s;ed to &s;ay he never could read it without incredible tran&s;port. It is much cen&s;ured by Mr. Pope, who, notwith&s;tanding, acknowledges that there is a daring, fiery &s;pirit, which animates it, &s;omething like what one might imagine Homer him&s;elf would have writ before he arrived at years of di&s;cretion. He tran&s;lated al&s;o the Batrachomyomachia, and all the Hymns of Homer, to which he annexed the ver&s;es here printed; fini&s;hed Marlow's Tran&s;|lation of Mu&s;aeus; produced &s;everal original Poems, and &s;ome other Tran&s;lations; was the author of &s;eventeen dra|matick performances, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted Shirley in two others. For this note I am indebted to the new edition of Dod&s;ley's Old Plays, vol. IV. p. 113. where the reader will find &s;ome other curious particulars of Chapman, and an exact li&s;t of his dra|matick writings.</P>
<P>Of the Batrachomyomachia and Hymns, I have the copy pre&s;ented to Lord Ru&s;&s;el, with the following MS. dedi|cation:

<HEAD>CONCLUSION OF <HI>NOSCE TEIPSUM</HI></HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR JOHN DAVIES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Son of a wealthy tanner of Chi&s;grove in Wilt&s;hire, and born there about 1569; commoner of Queen's College, Ox|ford, in Michaelmas term 1583. When he had taken the degree of B.A. he removed to the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar. Being expelled thence on account of a quarrel, he returned to Oxford. He was afterwards rein|&s;tated in the Temple, practi&s;ed as a barri&s;ter, and was cho&s;en a burge&s;s in the parliament held at We&s;tmin&s;ter in 1601. Upon the death of Queen Elizabeth, our author went with Lord Hun&s;don into Scotland, to congratulate King James. That prince was learned him&s;elf, and a great encourager of learned men; when Hun&s;don and his retinue were admitted into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing's pre&s;ence, his maje&s;ty enquired the names of the gentlemen who accompanied him; his lord&s;hip naming among the re&s;t John Davies, the king pre&s;ently a&s;ked whe|ther he was No&s;ce Teiptum, which was the title of his poem on the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mortality of the Soul, and being an&s;wered that he was, he graciou&s;ly embraced him, and a&s;&s;ured him of his fa|vour. The king pre&s;ently after promoted him to the office of &s;olicitor and then attorney-general in Ireland, where in 1606 he was made &s;erjeant at law, and afterwards &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of commons in that kingdom; the year following he received the order of knighthood from the king at Whitehall. In the year 1612 he publi&s;hed a very valuable book, called,
"A Di&s;covery of the true Cau&s;es why Ireland was never en|tirely &s;ubdued, nor brought under obedience of the Crown of England, until the beginning of his Maje&s;ty's happy Reign;" reprinted in 12mo, 1747.
Sir John, in 1612, quitted Ireland, and was made one of his maje&s;ty's Engli&s;h &s;erjeants at law. After his &s;ettling in England he was often appointed one of the judges of a&s;&s;ize in the circuits. He mar|ried Eleanor Tonchet, younge&s;t daughter of George, Lord Audley, by whom he had a &s;on an ideot, who died young, and a daughter named Lucy, married to Ferdinand, Lord Ha&s;tings, afterwards Earl of Huntingdon. In 1626 Sir John was appointed Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the King's Bench; but, before the ceremony of his in&s;tallation could be per|formed, he died &s;uddenly of an apoplexy, the 7th of Decem|ber, at his hou&s;e in the Strand, in the 57th year of his age. Sir John Davies, be&s;ides his Poems and his Account of the reduction of Ireland before-mentioned, publi&s;hed reports and other books relating to the con&s;titution and laws of this kingdom. Anthony Wood &s;ays, there were &s;everal of his manu&s;cripts on various &s;ubjects, which were formerly in the library of Sir James Ware, and &s;ince that in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Edward Earl of Clarendon; be&s;ides the&s;e, which were chiefly of the political kind, the &s;ame author &s;ays there were al&s;o &s;ome epigrams written by Sir John, and a metaphra&s;e of &s;everal of King David's P&s;alms, but never publi&s;hed. The poem on the Soul, which he called No&s;ce Teip&s;um, was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in 1599, and afterwards in 1622 with Hymns to A&s;trea in acro&s;tic ver&s;e; and Orche&s;tra, a poem expre&s;&s;ing the antiquity and excellence of dancing, in a dialogue be|tween Penelope and one of her wooers, containing one hun|dred and thirty-one &s;tanzas unfini&s;hed.

<HEAD>DETRACTION EXECRATED.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SIR JOHN SUCKLING<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A poet of great vivacity and &s;ome elegance, and one of the fine&s;t gentlemen of his time. He was &s;on to Sir John Suckling, comptroller of the hou&s;hold to king Charles the Fir&s;t; and was born at Witham in E&s;&s;ex in 1613. He &s;poke Latin at five years of age, and wrote it when nine. He had a general knowledge of polite literature; but applied him&s;elf more particularly to mu&s;ic and poetry. In the cour&s;e of his foreign travels, he made a campaign under Gu&s;tavus Adol|phus; and, at his return, rai&s;ed a &s;plendid troop of hor&s;e, at the expence of twelve thou&s;and pounds, for the &s;ervice of the king. This troop, with Sir John at its head, behaved &s;o ill in the engagement with the Scots, upon the Engli&s;h borders, in 1639, as to occa&s;ion the famous lampoon by Sir John Mennis, "Sir John he got him an ambling nag," &amp;c. which was &s;et to an Iri&s;h tune, and much &s;ung by the Parliamenta|rians. This di&s;a&s;trous exped<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion, and the ridicule that at|tended it, was &s;uppo&s;ed to have ha&s;tened his death, which happened in 1641, at the age of twenty-eight. His pro&s;e writings, particularly his "Di&s;cour&s;e of Religion," addre&s;&s;ed to lord Dor&s;et, are thought equal to the be&s;t of his poetical performances. His ballad on a wedding, and his
"Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets," are oftener remembered than any of his works.
This ballad was occa&s;ioned by the marriage of Roger Boyle, the fir&s;t earl of Orrery, with lady Margaret Howard, daughter of the earl of Suffolk. There was a great intimacy betwixt Sir John and the earl of Orrery, then lord Broghill. In his "Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets," he has given us &s;ome traits of the characters of his poetical brethren. This article is prin|cipally compiled from Jacob and Granger. The whole of Sir John Suckling's Works, containing his
"Poems, Letters, and Plays," were publi&s;hed &s;everal times by Mr. Ton&s;on; and in two neat volumes, by Mr. Davies, 1770.

<HEAD>SONG,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THOMAS CAREW<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomas Carew, a poet of real elegance, was a younger &s;on of the family of the Carews in Devon&s;hire. He was born in 1589; and after receiving &s;ome part of his education at Corpus Chri&s;ti College, Oxford, he &s;pent many years in France and Italy. Returning from travel, he followed the court, which, &s;ays Lord Clarendon,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the mode&s;ty of that time di&s;po&s;ed men to do &s;ome time, before they pretended to be of it; and he was very much e&s;teemed by the mo&s;t emi|nent per&s;ons in the court, and well looked upon by the King him&s;elf, &s;ome years before he could obtain to be Sewer to the King; and when the King conferred that place upon him it was not without the regret even of the whole Scotch nation, which united them&s;elves in recom|mending another gentleman to it; and of &s;o great value were tho&s;e relations held in that age, when maje&s;ty was beheld with the reverence it ought to be."</Q>
Wood, the ce|lebrated Oxford Biographer, &s;ays that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was adored by the poets of his time"</Q>
Which &s;eems to be true, as we well know that his admirers were the fir&s;t men of the age; that Montague, the Lord Abbot of Pontois, care&s;&s;ed him; that Donne, D' Avenant, and May, loved him. Suckling too admired him; and yet, in his Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets, &s;ays,
<Q><L>" Tom Carew came next, but he had a fault</L>
<L>" That would not well &s;tand with a Laureat;</L>
<L>" His Mu&s;e was hide-bound, and the i&s;&s;ue of 's brain</L>
<L>" Was &s;eldom brought forth but with trouble and pain."</L></Q>
Suckling knew otherwi&s;e: but we mu&s;t remember, that the poet, when he wrote this, was writing a &s;atire. The ele|gance of his love-&s;onnets made them familiar to his Maje&s;ty and his nobles; they were &s;ought after, read, and rehear&s;ed; and by his Maje&s;ty's command were &s;et to mu&s;ic, or (as Wood expre&s;&s;es it) wedded to the charming notes of Mr. Henry Lawes, who was gentleman of the King's chapel, and at that time the greate&s;t mu&s;ical compo&s;er in England. Lord Clarendon &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Carew was a per&s;on of a plea&s;ant and face|tious wit, and made many poems (e&s;pecially in the amorous way) which, for the &s;harpne&s;s of the fancy, and the ele|gance of the language in which that fancy was &s;pread, were at lea&s;t equal, if not &s;uperior, to any of that time: but his glory was, that after fifty years of his life had been &s;pent with le&s;s &s;everity or exactne&s;s than it ought to have been, he died with the greate&s;t remor&s;e for that licen&s;e, and with the greate&s;t manife&s;tation of Chri&s;tianity that his be&s;t friends could de&s;ire."</Q>
He died in the year 1639. I have already mentioned that his poems were publi&s;hed in 1772 by Mr. Davies. N.</NOTE>, ESQ.</BYLINE>
