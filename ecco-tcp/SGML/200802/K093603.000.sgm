<HEAD>To Mr. INCLEDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the very eminent line you are ranked in as a vocal performer, and the great plea&s;ure I have often re|ceived when I have heard you &s;ing &s;ome of the following Songs, I thought there would be no impropriety, tru&s;ting at the &s;ame time that you would not take it ami&s;s, were I to in&s;cribe the following little work to you. I have been the more particularly urged to publi&s;h my &s;ongs in this manner, from hearing of the frequent applications which have been made for them to almo&s;t every book&s;eller in town, who have not had it in their power until now, to gratify their different cu&s;tomers. There are more people
<PB N="4" REF="3">
capable of reading than &s;inging a &s;ong, therefore, tho&s;e that have not &s;tudied mu|&s;ic &s;ufficiently, may have the opportunity of looking over the words in the clo&s;et; many of them have been &s;et by &s;ome of the mo&s;t able compo&s;ers, and many al&s;o by the mo&s;t moderate ones; which have often been the cau&s;e of putting the reader out of humour with the words, from the mu|&s;ician's mi&s;conception of the &s;ubject, or his deficiency in re&s;pect to effect and harmony. Many an author has had the mortification of &s;eeing his words martyred by the com|po&s;er of the mu&s;ic, who has evidently &s;hewn, by his empha&s;is (if I may be allowed that phra&s;e) being wrongly placed, that although he might be full ma&s;ter of his &s;cience, &s;o far as to know a crotchet from a minim, yet if you had &s;et him to read, perhaps, he did not know a &s;ub&s;tantive from a verb, and a total &s;tranger altogether of antithe&s;is or inflection; in &s;uch ca&s;e, good words are often pro&s;tituted through ignorance, which is as mortifying as if any body were to put a valuable piece of broad cloth into the hands of an un&s;kilful Taylor, who having no ta&s;te, in re&s;pect to fa&s;hion or &s;hape,
<PB N="5" REF="4">
often produces a coat not only unfit to be worn, but unfit to be &s;een al&s;o, from which rea&s;on, it has di&s;gu&s;ted, and been thrown upon the &s;helf to rot in oblivion. And on the other hand, many a &s;ong which has been meerly <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> without the lea&s;t pre|tention to the name of Poetry, dive&s;ted at the &s;ame time of in&s;tructive matter as well as of figure or incident, has become a fa|vourite ditty with the Public, from the in|genuity of the compo&s;er of the mu&s;ic, who may have been lucky enough to give it a good tune.</P>
<P>In the above in&s;tance we are told the Italian compo&s;ers do often excel; and the late ingenious Bonnel Thornton, joint writer of the Connoi&s;ieur, has, in &s;ome part of his works, given us a tran&s;lation of one of their popular airs, which we al&s;o find to be &s;trictly <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> and runs thus:
<Q><L>" Where, which, and wherefore,</L>
<L>" There, this, and therefore!!!"</L></Q>
This is a kind of fa&s;hionable <HI>&s;caffolding</HI> for the mu&s;ic, which the compo&s;er <HI>builds</HI> upon,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and fini&s;hes his part by <HI>line</HI> and <HI>rule,</HI> like a good ma&s;on or bricklayer, who never con&s;iders, or looks into the imperfection of the architect, but is perfectly contented that he has fini&s;hed <HI>his</HI> part of the bu&s;ine&s;s well, let the &s;uper&s;tructure be ever &s;o con|temptible; but you are a better judge of mu&s;ic than I am, and if this metaphor &s;hould not hold good, you will be kind enough to pardon,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your mo&s;t obedient Servant, GEO. S. CAREY.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>SEQUEL TO POLL OF PLYMOUTH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Edward fir&s;t heard Poll of Plymouth was dead,</L>
<L>The functions of life made a pau&s;e,</L>
<L>His piteous eyes &s;tood agha&s;t in his head,</L>

<L>And eagerne&s;s fla&s;h'd in his eyes.</L>
