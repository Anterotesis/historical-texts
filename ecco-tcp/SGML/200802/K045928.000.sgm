<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Speech has been much the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; and the de&s;ire of having it printed was la&s;t &s;ummer very general. The means of gratifying the public curio&s;ity were obligingly furni&s;hed from the notes of &s;ome Gentlemen, Members of the la&s;t Parliament.</P>
<P>This piece has been for &s;ome months ready for the pre&s;s. But a delicacy, po&s;&s;ibly over &s;crupulous, has delayed the publi|cation to this time. The friends of admini&s;tration have been u&s;ed to attribute a great deal of the oppo&s;ition to their mea|&s;ures in America to the writings publi&s;hed in England. The Editor of this Speech kept it back, until all the mea&s;ures of government have had their full operation, and can be no longer affected, if ever they could have been affected, by any publi|cation.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t Readers will recollect the uncommon pains taken at the beginning of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t Parliament, and indeed during the whole cour&s;e of it, to a&s;per&s;e the characters, and decry, the mea&s;ures of tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be friends
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
to America; in order to weaken the effect of their oppo&s;ition to the acts of rigour then preparing again&s;t the Colonies. This Speech contains a full refutation of the charges again&s;t that party with which Mr. Burke has all along acted. In doing this, he has taken a review of the effects of all the &s;chemes which have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively adopted in the government of the Plan|tations. The &s;ubject is intere&s;ting; the matters of informa|tion various, and important; and the publication at this time, the Editor hopes, will not be thought un&s;ea&s;onable.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH OF EDMUND BURKE, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t Parliament, on the 19th of April, 1774, Mr. Ro&s;e Fuller, Member for Rye, made the following motion; That an Act made in the &s;eventh Year of the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, intituled, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An Act for granting certain Duties in the Briti&s;h Colonies and Plantations in America; for allowing a Drawback of the Duties of Cu&s;toms upon the Exportation from this Kingdom of Coffee and Cocoa Nuts, of the Produce of the &s;aid Colonies or Plantations; for di&s;continuing the Drawbacks payable on China Earthen Ware exported to America; and for more effectually preventing the clande&s;tine running of Goods in the &s;aid Colonies and Planta|tions;"</Q> might be read.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame being read accordingly; He moved, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That this Hou&s;e will, upon this day &s;even night, re&s;olve it&s;elf into a Com|mittee of the whole Hou&s;e, to take into con&s;ideration the duty of 3 d. <HI>per</HI> pound weight upon tea, payable in all his Maje&s;ty's Dominions in America, impo&s;ed by the &s;aid Act; and al&s;o the appropriation of the &s;aid duty."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">On this latter motion a warm and intere&s;ting debate aro&s;e, in which Mr. Edmund Burke &s;poke as follows.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Agree with the Honourable Gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles Wol&s;ran Cornwall, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> lately appointed one of the Lords of the Trea&s;ury.</NOTE> who &s;poke la&s;t, that this &s;ubject is not new in this Hou&s;e. Very di&s;agreeably to this Hou&s;e, very unfortunately to this Nation, and to the peace and pro&s;perity of this whole Empire, no topic has been more familiar to us. For nine long years, &s;e&s;&s;ion after &s;e&s;&s;ion, we have been la&s;hed round and round this mi&s;erable circle of occa&s;ional arguments and temporary expedients. I am &s;ure our heads mu&s;t turn, and our &s;tomachs nau&s;eate with them. We have had them in every &s;hape; we have looked at them in every point of view. Invention is ex|hau&s;ted; rea&s;on is fatigued; experience has given judgement; but ob&s;tinacy is not yet conquered.</P>
<P>The Hon. Gentleman has made one endeavour more to diver&s;ify the form of this di&s;gu&s;ting argument. He has thrown out a &s;peech com|po&s;ed almo&s;t entirely of challenges. Challenges are &s;erious things; and as he is a man of prudence as well as re&s;olution, I dare &s;ay he has very well weighed tho&s;e challenges before he delivered them. I had long the happine&s;s to &s;it at the &s;ame &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, and to agree with the Hon. Gentleman on all the American que&s;tions. My &s;en|timents, I am &s;ure, are well known to him; and I thought I had been perfectly acquainted with his. Though I find my&s;elf mi&s;ta|ken, he will &s;till permit me to u&s;e the privilege of an old friend|&s;hip; he will permit me to apply my&s;elf to the Hou&s;e under the &s;anction of his authority; and, on the various grounds he has mea&s;ured out, to &s;ubmit to you the poor opinions which I have formed, upon a matter of importance enough to demand the fulle&s;t con&s;ideration I could be&s;tow upon it.</P>
<P>He has &s;tated to the Hou&s;e two grounds of deliberation; one narrow and &s;imple, and merely confined to the que&s;tion on your paper: the other more large and more complicated; comprehending the whole &s;eries of the parliamentary proceedings with regard to
<PB N="3" REF="6">
America, their cau&s;es, and their con&s;equences. With regard to the latter ground, he &s;tates it as u&s;ele&s;s, and thinks it may be even dan|gerous, to enter into &s;o exten&s;ive a field of enquiry. Yet, to my &s;ur|prize, he had hardly laid down this re&s;trictive propo&s;ition, to which his authority would have given &s;o much weight, when directly, and with the &s;ame authority, he condemns it; and declares it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the mo&s;t ample hi&s;torical detail. His zeal has thrown him a little out of his u&s;ual accuracy. In this perplexity what &s;hall we do, Sir, who are willing to &s;ubmit to the law he gives us? He has reprobated in one part of his &s;peech the rule he had laid down for debate in the other; and, after narrowing the ground for all tho&s;e who are to &s;peak after him; he takes an excur&s;ion him&s;elf, as unbounded as the &s;ubject and the extent of his great abilities.</P>
<P>Sir, When I cannot obey all his laws, I will do the be&s;t I can. I will endeavour to obey &s;uch of them as have the &s;anction of his example; and to &s;tick to that rule, which, though not con&s;i&s;tent with the other, is the mo&s;t rational. He was certainly in the right when he took the matter largely. I cannot prevail on my|&s;elf to agree with him in his cen&s;ure of his own conduct. It is not, he will give me leave to &s;ay, either u&s;ele&s;s or dangerous. He a&s;&s;erts, that retro&s;pect is not wi&s;e; and the proper, the only proper, &s;ubject of enquiry is, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not how we got into this difficulty, but how we are to get out of it."</Q> In other words, we are, according to him, to con&s;ult our invention, and to reject our experience. The mode of deliberation he recommends is diametrically oppo&s;ite to every rule of rea&s;on, and every principle of good &s;en&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t mankind. For, that &s;en&s;e and that rea&s;on, I have always under&s;tood, ab&s;olutely to pre&s;cribe, whenever we are involved in difficulties from the mea&s;ures we have pur&s;ued, that we &s;hould take a &s;trict review of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, in order to correct our errors if they &s;hould be corrigible; or at lea&s;t to avoid a dull uniformity in mi&s;chief, and the unpitied calamity of being repeatedly caught in the &s;ame &s;nare.</P>
<P>Sir, I will freely follow the Hon. Gentleman in his hi&s;to|rical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, without the lea&s;t management for men or mea&s;ures, further than as they &s;hall &s;eem to me to de&s;erve it. But before I
<PB N="4" REF="7">
go into that large con&s;ideration, becau&s;e I would omit nothing that can give the Hou&s;e &s;atisfaction, I wi&s;h to tread the narrow ground to which alone the Hon. Gentleman, in one part of his &s;peech has &s;o &s;trictly confined us.</P>
<P>He de&s;ires to know, whether, if we were to repeal this tax, agreeably to the propo&s;ition of the Hon. Gentleman who made the motion, the Americans would not take po&s;t on this con|ce&s;&s;ion, in order to make a new attack on the next body of taxes; and whether they would not call for a repeal of the duty on wine as loudly as they do now for the repeal of the duty on tea? Sir, I can give no &s;ecurity on this &s;ubject. But I will do all that I can, and all that can be fairly demanded. To the <HI>experience</HI> which the Hon. Gentleman reprobates in one in&s;tant, and reverts to in the next; to that experience, without the lea&s;t wavering or he&s;ita|tion on my part, I &s;teadily appeal; and would to God there was no other arbiter to decide on the vote with which the Hou&s;e is to conclude this day.</P>
<P>When Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in the year 1766, I affirm, fir&s;t, that the Americans did <HI>not</HI> in con&s;equence of this mea&s;ure call upon you to give up the former parliamentary revenue which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in that Country; or even any one of the articles which compo&s;e it. I affirm al&s;o, that when, departing from the maxims of that repeal, you revived the &s;cheme of taxation, and thereby filled the minds of the Coloni&s;ts with new jealou&s;y, and all &s;orts of apprehen&s;ions, then it was that they quarreled with the old taxes, as well as the new; then it was, and not till then, that they que&s;tioned all the parts of your legi&s;lative power; and by the battery of &s;uch que&s;tions have &s;haken the &s;olid &s;tructure of this Empire to its deepe&s;t foundations.</P>
<P>Of tho&s;e two propo&s;itions I &s;hall, before I have done, give &s;uch convincing, &s;uch damning proof, that however the contrary may be whi&s;pered in circles, or bawled in news-papers, they never more will dare to rai&s;e their voices in this Hou&s;e. I &s;peak with great confidence. I have rea&s;on for it. The Mini&s;ters are with me. <HI>They</HI> at lea&s;t are convinced that the repeal of the Stamp Act had
<PB N="5" REF="8">
not, and that no repeal can have, the con&s;equences which the Hon. Gentleman who defends their mea&s;ures is &s;o much alarmed at. To their conduct, I refer him for a conclu&s;ive an&s;wer to his objection. I carry my proof irre&s;i&s;tibly into the very body of both Mini&s;try and Parliament; not on any general rea&s;oning growing out of collateral matter, but on the conduct of the Hon. Gentleman's mini&s;terial friends on the new revenue it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Act of 1767, which grants this ten duty, &s;ets forth in its preamble, that it was expedient to rai&s;e a revenue in America, for the &s;upport of the civil government there as well as for purpo&s;es &s;till more exten&s;ive. To this &s;upport the Act a&s;&s;igns &s;ix branches of du|ties. About two years after this Act pa&s;&s;ed, the Mini&s;try, I mean the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, thought it expedient to repeal five of the duties, and to leave (for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves) only the &s;ixth &s;tand|ing. Suppo&s;e any per&s;on, at the time of that repeal, had thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed the Mini&s;ter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North, then Chancellor of the Exchequer.</NOTE>, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Condemning, as you do, the repeal of the Stamp Act, Why do you venture to repeal the duties upon gla&s;s, paper, and painters colours? Let your pretence for the repeal be what it will, are you not thoroughly convinced, that your conce&s;&s;ions will produce, not &s;atisfaction, but in&s;olence in the Americans; and that the giving up the&s;e taxes will nece&s;&s;itate the giving up of all the re&s;t?"</Q> This objection was as palpable then as it is now; and it was as good for pre&s;erving the five duties as for retaining the &s;ixth. Be&s;ides, the Mini&s;ter will recollect, that the repeal of the Stamp Act had but ju&s;t preceded his repeal; and the ill policy of that mea&s;ure (had it been &s;o impolitic as it has been repre&s;ented), and the mi&s;chiefs it produced, were quite recent. Upon the principles therefore of the Hon. Gentleman, upon the principles of the Mini&s;ter him&s;elf, the Mini&s;ter has nothing at all to an&s;wer. He &s;tands condemned by him&s;elf, and by all his a&s;&s;ociates old and new, as a de&s;troyer, in the fir&s;t tru&s;t of finance, of the revenues; and in the fir&s;t rank of honour, as a betrayer of the dignity of his Country.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men, e&s;pecially great men, do not always know their well-wi&s;hers. I come to re&s;cue that Noble Lord out of the hands
<PB N="6" REF="9">
of tho&s;e he calls his friends; and even out of his own. I will do him the ju&s;tice, he is denied at home. He has not been this wicked or imprudent man. He knew that a repeal had no ten|dency to produce the mi&s;chiefs which give &s;o much alarm to his Honourable friend. His work was not bad in its principle, but imperfect in its execution; and the motion on your paper pre&s;&s;es him only to compleat a proper plan, which, by &s;ome unfortunate and unaccountable error, he had left unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P>I hope, Sir, the Hon. Gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t, is tho|roughly &s;atisfied, and &s;atisfied out of the proceedings of Mini&s;try on their own favourite Act, that his fears from a repeal are ground|le&s;s. If he is not, I leave him, and the Noble Lord who &s;its by him, to &s;ettle the matter, as well as they can, together; for if the repeal of American taxes de&s;troys all our government in America&mdash;He is the man!&mdash;and he is the wor&s;t of all the repealers, becau&s;e he is the la&s;t.</P>
<P>But I hear it rung continually in my ears, now and formerly,&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the Preamble! what will become of the Preamble, if you repeal this Tax?"</Q>&mdash;I am &s;orry to be compelled &s;o often to expo&s;e the calamities and di&s;graces of Parliament. The preamble of this law, &s;tanding as it now &s;tands, has the lie direct given to it by the provi&s;ionary part of the Act; if that can be called provi&s;ionary which makes no provi&s;ion. I &s;hould be afraid to expre&s;s my&s;elf in this manner, e&s;pecially in the face of &s;uch a formidable array of ability as is now drawn up before me, compo&s;ed of the antient hou&s;ehold troops of that &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, and the new recruits from this, if the matter were not clear and indi&s;putable. Nothing but truth could give me this firmne&s;s; but plain truth and clear evidence can be beat down by no ability. The Clerk will be &s;o good as to turn to the Act, and to read this favourite preamble.<Q REND="inline"><P><HI>Whereas it is</HI> expedient <HI>that a revenue &s;hould be rai&s;ed in your Ma|je&s;ty's Dominions in America, for making a more</HI> certain <HI>and</HI> adequate <HI>provi&s;ion for defraying the charge of the</HI> admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and &s;upport of civil government, <HI>in &s;uch Provinces where it &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary; and towards</HI> further defraying <HI>the expences of</HI> defending, protecting, and &s;ecuring the &s;aid Dominions.</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="10">You have heard this pompous performance. Now where is the revenue which is to do all the&s;e mighty things? Five &s;ixths re|pealed&mdash;abandoned&mdash;&s;unk&mdash;gone&mdash;lo&s;t for ever. Does the poor &s;olitary tea duty &s;upport the purpo&s;es of this preamble? Is not the &s;upply there &s;tated as effectually abandoned as if the tea duty had peri&s;hed in the general wreck? Here, Mr. Speaker, is a precious mockery&mdash;a preamble without an act&mdash;taxes granted in order to be repealed&mdash;and the rea&s;ons of the grant &s;till carefully kept up! This is rai&s;ing a revenue in America! This is pre|&s;erving dignity in England! If you repeal this tax in compliance with the motion, I readily admit that you lo&s;e this fair preamble. E&s;timate your lo&s;s in it. The object of the act is gone already; and all you &s;uffer is the purging the Statute-book of the oppro|brium of an empty, ab&s;urd, and fal&s;e recital.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid again and again, that the five Taxes were re|pealed on commercial principles. It is &s;o &s;aid in the paper in my hand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Hill&s;borough's Circular Letter to the Governors of the Colonies concerning the Repeal of &s;ome of the Duties laid in the Act of 1767.</NOTE>; a paper which I con&s;tantly carry about; which I have often u&s;ed, and &s;hall often u&s;e again. What is got by this paltry pretence of commercial principles I know not; for, if your govern|ment in America is de&s;troyed by the <HI>repeal of Taxes,</HI> it is of no con&s;equence upon what ideas the repeal is grounded. Repeal this Tax too upon commercial principles if you plea&s;e. The&s;e principles will &s;erve as well now as they did formerly. But you know that, either your Objection to a repeal from the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed con&s;equences has no validity, or that this pretence never could remove it. This commercial motive never was believed by any man, either in Ame|rica, which this Letter is meant to &s;oothe, or in England, which it is meant to deceive. It was impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould. Becau&s;e every man, in the lea&s;t acquainted with the detail of Commerce, mu&s;t know, that &s;everal of the articles on which the Tax was repealed were fitter objects of Duties than almo&s;t any other articles that could po&s;&s;ibly be cho&s;en; without compari&s;on more &s;o, than the Tea that was left taxed; as infinitely le&s;s liable to be eluded by contraband. The Tax upon Red and White Lead was of this na|ture. You have, in this kingdom, an advantage in Lead, that
<PB N="8" REF="11">
amounts to a monopoly. When you find your&s;elf in this &s;ituation of advantage, you &s;ometimes venture to tax even your own export. You did &s;o, &s;oon after the la&s;t war; when, upon this principle, you ventured to impo&s;e a duty on Coals. In all the articles of Ame|rican contraband trade who ever heard of the &s;muggling of Red Lead, and White Lead? You might, therefore, well enough, with|out danger of contraband, and without injury to Commerce (if this were the whole con&s;ideration) have taxed the&s;e commodities. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Gla&s;s. Be&s;ides &s;ome of the things taxed were &s;o trivial, that the lo&s;s of the objects them&s;elves and their utter annihilation out of American Commerce, would have been comparatively as nothing. But is the article of Tea &s;uch an object in the Trade of England, as not to be felt, or felt but &s;lightly, like White Lead, and Red Lead, and Painters Colours? Tea is an object of far other importance. Tea is perhaps the mo&s;t im|portant object, taking it with its nece&s;&s;ary connections, of any in the mighty circle of our Commerce. If commercial principles had been the true motives to the Repeal, or had they been at all attended to, Tea would have been the la&s;t article we &s;hould have left taxed for a &s;ubject of controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Sir, it is not a plea&s;ant con&s;ideration; but nothing in the world can read &s;o awful and &s;o in&s;tructive a le&s;&s;on, as the conduct of Mini&s;try in this bu&s;ine&s;s, upon the mi&s;chief of not having large and liberal ideas in the management of great affairs. Never have the &s;er|vants of the &s;tate looked at the whole of your complicated intere&s;ts in one connected view. They have taken things, by bits and &s;craps, &s;ome at one time and one pretence, and &s;ome at another, ju&s;t as they pre&s;&s;ed, without any &s;ort of regard to their relations or de|pendencies. They never had any kind of &s;y&s;tem, right or wrong; but only invented occa&s;ionally &s;ome mi&s;erable tale for the day, in order meanly to &s;neak out of difficulties, into which they had proudly &s;trutted. And they were put to all the&s;e &s;hifts and devices, full of meane&s;s and full of mi&s;chief, in order to pilfer piecemeal a repeal of an act, which they had not the generous courage, when they found and felt their error, honourably and fairly to di&s;claim. By &s;uch management, by the irre&s;i&s;tible operation of feeble coun|cils, &s;o paltry a &s;um as three-pence in the eyes of a financier, &s;o
<PB N="9" REF="12">
in&s;ignificant an article as tea in the eyes of a philo&s;opher, have &s;haken the pillars of a Commercial Empire that circled the whole globe.</P>
<P>Do you forget that, in the very la&s;t year, you &s;tood on the precipice of general bankruptcy? Your danger was indeed great. You were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the affairs of the Ea&s;t India Company; and you well know what &s;ort of things are involved in the compre|hen&s;ive energy of that &s;ignificant appellation. I am not called upon to enlarge to you on that danger, which you thought proper your&s;elves to aggravate, and to di&s;play to the world with all the pa|rade of indi&s;creet declamation. The monopoly of the mo&s;t lucrative trades, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of imperial revenues, had brought you to the verge of beggary and ruin. Such was your repre&s;entation&mdash;&s;uch, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, was your ca&s;e. The vent of Ten Millions of pounds of this commodity, now locked up by the operation of an injudicious Tax, and rotting in the warehou&s;es of the Company, would have prevented all this di&s;tre&s;s, and all that &s;eries of de&s;perate mea&s;ures which you thought your&s;elves obliged to take in con&s;equence of it. America would have furni&s;hed that vent, which no other part of the world can furni&s;h but America; where Tea is next to a nece&s;&s;ary of life; and where the demand grows upon the &s;upply. I hope our dear-bought Ea&s;t India Committees have done us at lea&s;t &s;o much good, as to let us know, that without a more exten&s;ive &s;ale of that article our Ea&s;t India revenues and acqui&s;itions can have no certain connection with this country. It is through the American trade of Tea that your Ea&s;t India conque&s;ts are to be prevented from cru&s;hing you with their burthen. They are ponderous indeed; and they mu&s;t have that great country to lean upon, or they tumble upon your head. It is the &s;ame folly that has lo&s;t you at once the benefit of the We&s;t and of the Ea&s;t. This folly has thrown open folding-doors to contraband; and will be the means of giving the profits of the trade of your colonies, to every nation but your&s;elves. Never did a people &s;uffer &s;o much for the empty words of a preamble. It mu&s;t be given up. For on what prin|ciple does it &s;tand? This famous revenue &s;tands, at this hour, on all the debate, as a de&s;cription of revenue not as yet known in all the comprehen&s;ive (but too comprehen&s;ive!) vocabulary of finance&mdash;<HI>a</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="13">
<HI>preambulary tax.</HI> It is indeed a tax of &s;ophi&s;try, a tax of pedantry, a tax of di&s;putation, a tax of war and rebellion, a tax for any thing but benefit to the impo&s;ers, or &s;atisfaction to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Well! but whatever it is, gentlemen will force the Coloni&s;ts to take the Teas. You will force them? has &s;even years &s;truggle been yet able to force them? O but it &s;eems <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we are in the right.&mdash;The tax is trifling&mdash;in effect it is rather an exoneration than an impo&s;ition; three-fourths of the duty formerly payable on teas exported to America is taken off; the place of col|lection is only &s;hifted; in&s;tead of the retention of a &s;hilling from the draw-back here, it is three-pence cu&s;tom paid in America."</Q> All this, Sir, is very true. But this is the very folly and mi&s;chief of the act. Incredible as it may &s;eem, you know, that you have deliberately thrown away a large duty which you held &s;ecure and quiet in your hands, for the vain hope of getting one three-fourths le&s;s, through every hazard, through certain litigation, and po&s;&s;ibly through war.</P>
<P>The manner of proceeding in the duties on paper and gla&s;s im|po&s;ed by the &s;ame act, was exactly in the &s;ame &s;pirit. There are heavy exci&s;es on tho&s;e articles when u&s;ed in England. On export the&s;e exci&s;es are drawn back. But in&s;tead of withholding the draw-back, which might have been done, with ea&s;e, without charge, without po&s;&s;ibility of &s;muggling; and in&s;tead of applying the money (money already in your hands) according to your plea|&s;ure, you began your operations in finance by flinging away your revenue; you allowed the whole draw-back on export, and then you charged the duty, (which you had before di&s;charged,) payable in the Colonies; where it was certain the collection would devour it to the bone; if any revenue were ever &s;uffered to be collected at all. One &s;pirit pervades and animates the whole ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Could any thing be a &s;ubject of more ju&s;t alarm to America, than to &s;ee you go out of the plain high road of finance, and give up your mo&s;t certain revenues and your cleare&s;t intere&s;ts, merely for the &s;ake of in&s;ulting your Colonies? No man ever doubted that the commodity of tea could bear an impo&s;ition of three-pence. But
<PB N="11" REF="14">
no commodity will bear three-pence, or will bear a penny, when the general feelings of men are irritated, and two millions of people are re&s;olved not to pay. The feelings of the Colonies were formerly the feelings of Great Britain. Theirs were formerly the feelings of Mr. Hampden when called upon for the payment of twenty &s;hillings. Would twenty &s;hillings have ruined Mr. Hamp|den's fortune? No! but the payment of half twenty &s;hillings, on the principle it was demanded, would have made him a &s;lave. It is the weight of that preamble, of which you are &s;o fond, and not the weight of the duty, that the Americans are unable and unwill|ing to bear.</P>
<P>It is then, Sir, upon the <HI>principle</HI> of this mea&s;ure, and nothing el&s;e, that we are at i&s;&s;ue. It is a principle of political expediency. Your act of 1767 a&s;&s;erts, that it is expedient to rai&s;e a revenue in America; your act of 1769, which takes away that revenue, contra|dicts the act of 1767; and, by &s;omething much &s;tronger than words, a&s;&s;erts, that it is not expedient. It is a reflexion upon your wi&s;dom to per&s;i&s;t in a &s;olemn parliamentary declaration of the expediency of any object, for which, at the &s;ame time, you make no &s;ort of provi&s;ion. And pray, Sir, let not this circum&s;tance e&s;cape you; it is very ma|terial; that the preamble of this act, which we wi&s;h to repeal, is not <HI>declaratory of a right,</HI> as &s;ome gentlemen &s;eem to argue it; it is only a recital of the <HI>expediency</HI> of a certain exerci&s;e of a right &s;uppo&s;ed already to have been a&s;&s;erted; an exerci&s;e you are now contending for by ways and means, which you confe&s;s, though they were obeyed, to be utterly in&s;ufficient for their purpo&s;e. You are there|fore at this moment in the aukward &s;ituation of fighting for a phan|tom; a quiddity; a thing that wants, not only a &s;ub&s;tance, but even a name; for a thing, which is neither ab&s;tract right, nor profitable enjoyment.</P>
<P>They tell you, Sir, that your dignity is tied to it. I know not how it happens, but this dignity of yours is a terrible incumbrance to you; for it has of late been ever at war with your intere&s;t, your equity, and every idea of your policy. Shew the thing you con|tend for to be rea&s;on; &s;hew it to be common &s;en&s;e; &s;hew it to be the means of attaining &s;ome u&s;eful end; and then I am content to allow it what dignity you plea&s;e. But what dignity is derived from
<PB N="12" REF="15">
the per&s;everance in ab&s;urdity is more than ever I could di&s;cern. The Hon. Gentleman has &s;aid well&mdash;indeed, in mo&s;t of his <HI>general</HI> ob&s;ervations I agree with him&mdash;he &s;ays, that this &s;ubject does not &s;tand as it did formerly. Oh, certainly not! every hour you con|tinue on this ill-cho&s;en ground, your difficulties thicken on you; and therefore my conclu&s;ion is, remove from a bad po&s;ition as quickly as you can. The di&s;grace, and the nece&s;&s;ity of yielding, both of them, grow upon you every hour of your delay.</P>
<P>But will you repeal the act, &s;ays the Hon. Gentleman, at this in&s;tant when America is in open re&s;i&s;tance to your authority, and that you have ju&s;t revived your &s;y&s;tem of taxation? He thinks he has driven us into a corner. But thus pent up, I am content to meet him; becau&s;e I enter the li&s;ts &s;upported by my old authority, his new friends, the mini&s;ters them&s;elves. The Hon. Gentleman remembers, that about five years ago as great di&s;turbances as the pre&s;ent prevailed in America on account of the new taxes. The mi|ni&s;ters repre&s;ented the&s;e di&s;turbances as trea&s;onable; and this Hou&s;e thought proper, on that repre&s;entation, to make a famous addre&s;s for a revival, and for a new application of a &s;tatute of H. VIII. We be&s;ought the King, in that well-con&s;idered addre&s;s, to enquire into trea&s;ons, and to bring the &s;uppo&s;ed traytors from America to Great Britain for trial. His Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to promi&s;e a compliance with our reque&s;t. All the attempts from this &s;ide of the Hou&s;e to re&s;i&s;t the&s;e violences, and to bring about a repeal, were treated with the utmo&s;t &s;corn. An apprehen&s;ion of the very con&s;equences now &s;tated by the Hon. Gentleman, was then given as a rea&s;on for &s;hutting the door again&s;t all hope of &s;uch an alteration. And &s;o &s;trong was the &s;pirit for &s;upporting the new taxes, that the &s;e&s;&s;ion concluded with the following remarkable declaration. After &s;tating the vigorous mea&s;ures which had been pur&s;ued, the Speech from the throne proceeds:<Q REND="inline"><P><HI>You have a&s;&s;ured me of your</HI> firm <HI>&s;upport in the</HI> pro&s;ecution <HI>of them. Nothing, in my opinion, could be more likely to enable the well-di&s;po&s;ed among my &s;ubjects in that part of the world, effectually to di&s;|courage and defeat the de&s;igns of the factious and &s;editious, than the hearty concurrence of every branch of the Legi&s;lature, in</HI> maintaining the execution of the laws in every <HI>part of my dominions.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="16">After this no man dreamt that a repeal under this mini&s;try could po&s;&s;ibly take place. The Hon.

Five days after this Speech, that is, on the 13th of the &s;ame month, the public Circular Letter, a part of which I am going to read to you, was written by Lord Hill&s;borough, Secretary of State for the Colonies.

<P>Here, Sir, is a canonical book of mini&s;terial &s;cripture; the general epi&s;tle to the Americans. What does the gentleman &s;ay to it? Here a repeal is promi&s;ed; promi&s;ed without condition; and while your authority was actually re&s;i&s;ted. I pa&s;s by the public promi&s;e of a Peer relative to the repeal of taxes by this Hou&s;e. I pa&s;s by the u&s;e of the King's name in a matter of &s;upply, that &s;acred and re&s;erved right of the Commons. I conceal the ridiculous figure of Parlia|ment, hurling its thunders at the gigantic rebellion of America; and then five days after, pro&s;trate at the feet of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies we

Pa&s;&s;ing, therefore, from the con&s;titutional con&s;ideration to the mere policy, does not this Letter imply, that the idea of taxing America for the purpo&s;e of revenue is an abominable project; when the Mini&s;try &s;uppo&s;e none but <HI>factious</HI> men, and with &s;editious views, could charge them with it? does not this Letter adopt and &s;anctify the American di&s;tinction of <HI>taxing for a revenue?</HI> does it not formally reject all future tax|ation on that principle? does it not &s;tate the mini&s;terial rejection of &s;uch principle of taxation, not as the occa&s;ional, but the con&s;tant opinion of the King's &s;ervants? does it not &s;ay (I care not how con&s;i&s;tently), but does it not &s;ay, that their conduct with regard to America has been <HI>always</HI> governed by this policy? It goes a great deal further.

<P>This Epi&s;tle was not the Letter of Lord Hill&s;borough &s;olely; though he held the official pen. It was the letter of the noble Lord upon the floor<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE>, and of all the King's then Mini&s;ters, who (with I think the exception of two only) are his Mini&s;ters at this hour. The very fir&s;t news that a Briti&s;h Parliament heard of what it was to do with the duties which it had given and granted to the King, was by the publication of the votes of American a&s;|&s;emblies. It was in America that your re&s;olutions were pre-declared. It was from thence that we knew to a certainty, how much exactly, and not a &s;cruple more nor le&s;s, we were to repeal. We were un|worthy to be let into the &s;ecret of our own conduct. The a&s;&s;em|blies had <HI>confidential</HI> communications from his Maje&s;ty's <HI>confidential</HI> &s;ervants. We were nothing but in&s;truments. Do you, after this, wonder that you have no weight and no re&s;pect in the Colonies? After this, are you &s;urprized, that Parliament is every day and every where lo&s;ing (I feel it with &s;orrow, I utter it with reluctance) that reveren|tial affection, which &s;o endearing a name of authority ought ever to

carry with it; that you are obeyed &s;olely from re&s;pect to the bayo|net; and that this Hou&s;e, the ground and pillar of freedom, is it&s;elf held up only by the under-pinning and clum&s;y buttre&s;&s;es of arbitrary power?</P>
<P>If this dignity, which is to &s;tand in the place of ju&s;t policy and common &s;en&s;e, had been con&s;ulted, there was a time for pre&s;erving it, and for reconciling it with any conce&s;&s;ion. If in the &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1768, that &s;e&s;&s;ion of idle terror and empty menaces, you had, as you were often pre&s;&s;ed to do, repealed the&s;e taxes, then your &s;trong operations would have come ju&s;tified and enforced, in ca&s;e your conce&s;&s;ions had been returned by outrages. But, prepo&s;te|rou&s;ly you began with violence; and before terrors could have any effect, either good or bad, your mini&s;ters immediately begged pardon, and promi&s;ed that repeal to the ob&s;tinate Americans which they had refu&s;ed in an ea&s;y, good-natured, complying Briti&s;h Parliament. The a&s;&s;emblies which had been publicly and avowedly di&s;&s;olved for <HI>their</HI> contumacy, are called together to receive <HI>your</HI> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Your mini&s;terial directors blu&s;tered like tragic tyrants here; and then went mumping with a &s;ore leg in America, cant|ing, and whining, and complaining of faction which repre&s;ented them as friends to revenue in the Colonies. I hope nobody in this Hou&s;e will hereafter have the impudence to defend American taxes in the name of Mini&s;try. The moment they do, with this letter of attorney in my hand, I will tell them, in the authori&s;ed terms, they are wretches, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"with factious and &s;editious views; ene|mies to the peace and pro&s;perity of the Mother Country and the Colonies," and &s;ubverters "of the mutual affection and confidence on which the glory and &s;afety of the Briti&s;h Empire depend."</Q></P>
<P>After this letter the que&s;tion is no more on propriety or dignity. They are gone already. The faith of your Sovereign is pledged for the political principle. The general declaration in the Letter goes to the whole of it. You mu&s;t therefore either abandon the &s;cheme of taxing; or you mu&s;t &s;end the Mini&s;ters tarred and feathered to America, who dared to hold out the Royal Faith for a renun|ciation of all taxes for revenue.

or <HI>fool's-cap,</HI> which you have given up, or the three-pence on tea which you retained. The Letter went &s;tampt with the public au|thority of this kingdom. The in&s;tructions for the Colony govern|ment go under no other &s;anction; and America cannot believe, and will not obey you, if you do not pre&s;erve this channel of com|munication &s;acred. You are now puni&s;hing the Colonies for acting on di&s;tinctions, held out by that very Mini&s;try which is here &s;hining in riches, in favour, and in power; and urging the pu|ni&s;hment of the very offence, to which they had them&s;elves been the tempters.</P>
<P>Sir, if rea&s;ons re&s;pecting &s;imply your own commerce, which is your own convenience, were the &s;ole grounds of the repeal of the five duties why does Lord Hill&s;borough, in di&s;claiming in the name of the King and Mini&s;try their ever having had an intent to tax for revenue, mention it as the means <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of ree&s;tabli&s;hing the confidence and affection of the Colonies?"</Q> Is it a way of &s;oothing <HI>others,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure them that you will take good care of <HI>your&s;elf?</HI> The medium, the only medium, for regaining their affection and confidence is, that you will take off &s;omething oppre&s;&s;ive to their minds. Sir, the Letter &s;trongly enforces that idea; for though the repeal of the taxes is promi&s;ed on commercial principles, yet the means of counteracting <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the in&s;inuations of men with factious and &s;editious views,"</Q> is by a di&s;claimer of the intention of taxing for revenue, as a con&s;tant inva|riable &s;entiment and rule of conduct in the government of America.</P>
<P>I remember that the noble Lord on the floor, not in a former debate to be &s;ure (it would be di&s;orderly to refer to it, I &s;uppo&s;e I read it &s;ome where), but the noble Lord was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that he did not conceive how it could enter into the head of man to im|po&s;e &s;uch taxes as tho&s;e of 1767. I mean tho&s;e taxes which he voted for impo&s;ing, and voted for repealing; as being taxes, contrary to all the principles of commerce, laid on <HI>Briti&s;h Manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>I dare &s;ay the noble Lord is perfectly well read, becau&s;e the duty of his particular office requires he &s;hould be &s;o, in all our revenue laws; and in the policy which is to be collected out of them. Now, Sir, when he had read this act of American re|venue, and a little recovered from his a&s;toni&s;hment, I &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="18" REF="21">
he made one &s;tep retrograde (it is but one) and looked at the act, which &s;tands ju&s;t before in the Statute Book. The American revenue act is the forty-fifth chapter; the other to which I refer, is the forty-fourth of the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e two acts are both to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; both revenue acts; both taxing out of the kingdom; and both taxing Briti&s;h manufactures exported. As the 45th is an act for rai&s;ing a revenue in America, the 44th is an act for rai&s;ing a revenue in the I&s;le of Man. The two acts perfectly agree in all re&s;pects, except one. In the act for taxing the I&s;le of Man, the noble Lord will find (not, as in the American act, four or five articles) but almo&s;t the <HI>whole body</HI> of Bri|ti&s;h manufactures, taxed from two and an half to fifteen <HI>per cent.</HI> and &s;ome articles, &s;uch as that of &s;pirits, a great deal higher. You did not think it uncommercial to tax the whole ma&s;s of your manufactures, and, let me add, your agriculture too; for, I now recollect, Briti&s;h corn is there al&s;o taxed up to ten <HI>per cent.</HI> and this too in the very head-quarters the very citadel of &s;muggling, the I&s;le of Man. Now will the noble Lord conde&s;cend to tell me why he repealed the taxes on your manufactures &s;ent out to Ame|rica, and not the taxes on the manufactures exported to the I&s;le of Man? The principle was exactly the &s;ame, the objects charged in|finitely more exten&s;ive, the duties without compari&s;on higher. Why? why, notwith&s;tanding all his childi&s;h pretexts, becau&s;e the taxes were quietly &s;ubmitted to in the I&s;le of Man; and becau&s;e they rai&s;ed a flame in America. Your rea&s;ons were political, not commercial. The repeal was made, as Lord Hill&s;borough's Letter well expre&s;&s;es it, to regain<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "the confidence and affection of the Colonies, on which the glory and &s;afety of the Briti&s;h Empire depend."</Q> A wi&s;e and ju&s;t motive &s;urely, if ever there was &s;uch. But the mi&s;chief and di&s;honour is, that you have not done what you had given the Colonies ju&s;t cau&s;e to expect, when your mi|ni&s;ters di&s;claimed the idea of taxes for a revenue. There is nothing &s;imple, nothing manly, nothing ingenuous, open, deci&s;ive, or &s;teady in the proceding, with regard either to the continuance or the repeal of the taxes. The whole has an air of littlene&s;s and fraud. The article of tea is &s;lurred over in the Circular Letter, as it were by accident&mdash;nothing is &s;aid of a re&s;olution either to keep that tax, or to give it up. There is no fair dealing in any part of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22">If you mean to follow your true motive and your public faith, give up your tax on tea for rai&s;ing a revenue, the principle of which has, in effect, been di&s;claimed in your name; and which produces you no advantage; no, not a penny. Or, if you choo&s;e to go on with a poor pretence in&s;tead of a &s;olid rea&s;on, and will &s;till adhere to your cant of commerce, you have ten thou&s;and times more &s;trong commercial rea&s;ons for giving up this duty on tea, than for abandoning the five others that you have already renounced.</P>
<P>The American con&s;umption of teas is annually, I believe, worth 300,000 l. at the lea&s;t farthing. If you urge the American violence as a ju&s;tification of your per&s;everance in enforcing this tax, you know that you can never an&s;wer this plain que&s;tion&mdash;Why did you repeal the others given in the &s;ame act, whil&s;t the very &s;ame violence &s;ub&s;i&s;ted?&mdash;But you did not find the violence cea&s;e upon that occa&s;ion.&mdash;No! becau&s;e the conce&s;&s;ion was far &s;hort of &s;atis|fying the principle which Lord Hill&s;borough had abjured; or even the pretence on which the repeal of the other taxes was announced: and becau&s;e, by enabling the Ea&s;t India Company to open a &s;hop for defeating the American re&s;olution not to pay that &s;pecific tax, you manife&s;tly &s;hewed a hankering after the principle of the act which you formerly had renounced. Whatever road you take leads to compliance with this motion. It opens to you at the end of every vi&s;to. Your commerce, you policy, your promi&s;es, your rea&s;ons, your pretences, your con&s;i&s;tency, your incon&s;i&s;tency&mdash;all jointly oblige you to this repeal.</P>
<P>But &s;till it &s;ticks in our throats, if we go &s;o far, the Americans will go farther.&mdash;We do not know that. We ought, from expe|rience, rather to pre&s;ume the contrary. Do we not know for certain, that the Americans are going on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, whil&s;t we refu&s;e to gratify them? Can they do more, or can they do wor&s;e, if we yield this point? I think this conce&s;&s;ion will rather fix a turnpike to prevent their further progre&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer for bodies of men.

e&s;teem, on the part of the governed. I would certainly, at lea&s;t, give the&s;e fair principles a fair trial; which, &s;ince the making of act to this hour, they never have had.</P>
<P>Sir, the Hon. Gentleman having &s;poken what he thought nece&s;&s;ary upon the narrow part of the &s;ubject, I have given him, I hope, a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. He next pre&s;&s;es me by a variety of direct challenges and oblique reflexions to &s;ay &s;omething on the hi&s;torical part. I &s;hall therefore, Sir, open my&s;elf fully on that important and delicate &s;ubject; not for the &s;ake of telling you a long &s;tory (which, I know, Mr. Speaker, you are not particularly fond of), but for the &s;ake of the weighty in&s;truction that, I flatter my&s;elf, will nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from it. It &s;hall not be longer, if I can help it, than &s;o &s;erious a matter requires.</P>
<P>Permit me then, Sir, to lead your attention very far back; back to the act of navigation; the corner-&s;tone of the policy of this country with regard to its colonies. Sir, that policy was, from the beginning, purely commercial; and the commercial &s;y&s;tem was wholly re&s;trictive. It was the &s;y&s;tem of a monopoly. No trade was let loo&s;e from that con&s;traint, but merely to enable the Coloni&s;ts to di&s;po&s;e of what, in the cour&s;e of your trade, you could not take; or to enable them to di&s;po&s;e of &s;uch articles as we forced upon them, and for which, without &s;ome degree of liberty, they could not pay. Hence all your &s;pecific and detailed enumerations: hence the innumerable checks and counter-checks: hence that infinite variety of paper chains by which you bind together this complicated &s;y&s;tem of the Colonies. This principle of com|mercial monopoly runs through no le&s;s than twenty-nine Acts of Parliament, from the year 1660 to the unfortunate period of 1764.</P>
<P>In all tho&s;e acts the &s;y&s;tem of commerce is e&s;tabli&s;hed, as that, from whence alone you propo&s;ed to make the Colonies contribute (I mean directly and by the operation of your &s;uperintending le|gi&s;lative power) to the &s;trength of the empire. I venture to &s;ay, that during that whole period, a parliamentary revenue from thence was never once in contemplation. Accordingly in all the number of laws pa&s;&s;ed with regard to the Plantations, the
<PB N="21" REF="24">
words which di&s;tingui&s;h revenue laws, &s;pecifically as &s;uch, were, I think, premeditately avoided. I do not &s;ay, Sir, that a form of words alters the nature of the law, or abridges the power of the lawgiver. It certainly does not. However title, and formal preambles are not always idle words; and the lawyers frequently argue from them. I &s;tate the&s;e facts to &s;hew, not what was your right, but what has been your &s;ettled policy, Our revenue laws have u&s;ually a <HI>title,</HI> purporting their being <HI>grants,</HI> and the words <HI>give and grant</HI> u&s;ually precede the enacting parts. Although duties were impo&s;ed on America in Acts of King Charles the Second, and in Acts of King William, no one title of giving <Q REND="inline">"an aid to His Maje&s;ty,"</Q> or any other of the u&s;ual titles to revenue acts, was to be found in any of them till 1764, nor were the words <Q REND="inline">"give and grant"</Q> in any preamble until the 6th of George the Second. However the title of this Act of George the Second, notwith&s;tanding the words of donation, con&s;iders it merely as a regulation of trade, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An Act for the better &s;ecur|ing of the trade of His Maje&s;ty's Sugar Colonies in America."</Q> This Act was made on a compromi&s;e of all, and at the expre&s;s de&s;ire of a part, of the Colonies them&s;elves. It was therefore in &s;ome mea&s;ure with their con&s;ent; and having a title directly pur|porting no more than a <HI>commercial regulation,</HI> and being in truth nothing more, the words were pa&s;&s;ed by, at a time when no jealou&s;y was entertained, and things were little &s;crutinized. Even Governor Barnard in his &s;econd printed letter, dated in 1763, gives it as his opinion, that <Q REND="inline">"it was an act of <HI>prohibition,</HI> not of revenue."</Q> This is certainly true; that no act avowedly for the purpo&s;e of re|venue, and with the ordinary title and recital taken together, is found in the &s;tatute book until the year I have mentioned; that is the year 1764. All before this period &s;tood on commercial regu|lation and re&s;traint. The &s;cheme of a Colony revenue by Briti&s;h authority appeared therefore to the Americans in the light of a great innovation; the words of Governor Barnard's ninth letter, written in Nov. 1765, &s;tate this idea very &s;trongly;<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "it mu&s;t," &s;ays he, "have been &s;uppo&s;ed, <HI>&s;uch an innovation as a parliamentary taxation,</HI> would cau&s;e a great <HI>alarm,</HI> and meet with much <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> in mo&s;t parts of America; it was <HI>quite new</HI> to the people, and had no <HI>vi&s;ible bounds</HI> &s;et to it."</Q> After &s;tating the weakne&s;s of govern|ment
<PB N="22" REF="25">
there, he &s;ays,<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "was this a time to introduce <HI>&s;o great a no|velty</HI> as a parliamentary inland taxation in America?"</Q> Whatever the right might have been, this mode of u&s;ing it was ab&s;olutely new in policy and practice.</P>
<P>Sir, they who are friends to the &s;chemes of American revenue &s;ay, that the commercial re&s;traint is full as hard a law for America to live under. I think &s;o too. I think it, if uncompen&s;ated, to be a condition of as rigorous &s;ervitude as men can be &s;ubject to. But America bore it from the fundamental act of navi|gation until 1764.&mdash;Why? Becau&s;e men do bear the inevitable con&s;titution of their original nature with all its infirmities. The act of navigation attended the Colonies from their infancy, grew with their growth, and &s;trengthened with their &s;trength. They were confirmed in obedience to it, even more by u&s;age than by law. They &s;carcely had remembered a time when they were not &s;ubject to &s;uch re&s;traint. Be&s;ides, they were indemnified for it by a pecuniary compen&s;ation. Their monopoli&s;t happened to be one of the riche&s;t men in the world. By his immen&s;e capital (primarily employed, not for their benefit, but his own), they were enabled to proceed with their fi&s;heries, their agriculture, their &s;hip|building (and their trade too within the limits), in &s;uch a manner as got far the &s;tart of the &s;low languid operations of una&s;&s;i&s;ted na|ture. This capital was a hot-bed to them. Nothing in the hi&s;|tory of mankind is like their progre&s;s. For my part, I never ca&s;t an eye on their flouri&s;hing commerce, and their cultivated and commodious life, but they &s;eem to me rather antient nations grown to perfection through a long &s;eries of fortunate events, and a train of &s;ucce&s;sful indu&s;try, accumulating wealth in many centuries, than the Colonies of ye&s;terday; than a &s;et of mi&s;erable out-ca&s;ts, a few years ago, not &s;o much &s;ent as thrown out, on the bleak and barren &s;hore of a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s three thou&s;and miles from all civilized intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>All this was done by England, whil&s;t England pur&s;ued trade and forgot revenue. You not only acquired commerce, but you actu|ally created the very objects of trade in America; and by that crea|tion you rai&s;ed the trade of this kingdom at lea&s;t four-fold. Ame|rica
<PB N="23" REF="26">
had the compen&s;ation of your capital, which made her bear her &s;ervitude. She had another compen&s;ation, which you are now going to take away from her. She had, except the commercial re&s;traint, every characteri&s;tic mark of a free people in all her internal concerns. She had the image of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. She had the &s;ub&s;tance. She was taxed by her own repre&s;entatives. She cho&s;e mo&s;t of her own magi&s;trates. She paid them all. She had in effect the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of her own internal government. This whole &s;tate of commercial &s;ervitude and civil liberty taken together, is certainly not perfect freedom; but comparing it with the ordi|nary circum&s;tances of human nature, it was an happy and a liberal condition.</P>
<P>I know, Sir, that great and not un&s;ucce&s;sful pains have been taken to inflame our minds by an outcry, in this Hou&s;e and out of it, that in America the act of navigation neither is, or ever was, obeyed. But if you take the Colonies through, I affirm, that its authority never was di&s;puted; that it was no where di&s;puted for any length of time; and on the whole, that it was well ob&s;erved. Wherever the Act pre&s;&s;ed hard, many individuals indeed evaded it. This is nothing. The&s;e &s;cattered individuals never denied the law, and never obeyed it. Ju&s;t as it happens whenever the laws of trade, whenever the laws of revenue, pre&s;s hard upon the people in Eng|land; in that ca&s;e all your &s;hores are full of contraband. Your right to give a monopoly to the Ea&s;t India Company, your right to lay immen&s;e duties on French brandy, are not di&s;puted in England. You do not make this charge on any man. But you know that there is not a creek from Pentland Frith to the I&s;le of Wight, in which they do not &s;muggle immen&s;e quantities of teas, Ea&s;t India goods, and brandies. I take it for granted, that the authority of Gov. Bernard in this point is indi&s;putable. Speaking of the&s;e laws, as they regarded that part of America now in &s;o unhappy a condition, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I believe they are no where better &s;upported than in this Province; I do not pretend that it is entirely free from a breach of the&s;e laws; but that &s;uch a breach, if di&s;covered, is ju&s;tly puni&s;hed."</Q> What more can you &s;ay of the obedience to any laws in any Country? An obedience to the&s;e laws formed the acknowledgement; in&s;tituted by your&s;elves, for your &s;uperiority; and was the payment you originally impo&s;ed for your protection.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27">Whether you were right or wrong in e&s;tabli&s;hing the Colonies on the principles of commercial monopoly, rather than on that of re|venue, is at this day a problem of mere &s;peculation. You cannot have both by the &s;ame authority. To join together the re&s;traints of an univer&s;al internal and external monopoly, with an univer&s;al internal and external taxation, is an unnatural union; perfect un+compen&s;ated &s;lavery. You have long &s;ince decided for your&s;elf and them; and you and they have pro&s;pered exceedingly under that deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>This nation, Sir, never thought of departing from that choice until the period immediately on the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war. Then a &s;cheme of government new in many things &s;eemed to have been adopted. I &s;aw, or thought I &s;aw, &s;everal &s;ymptoms of a great change, whil&s;t I &s;at in your gallery, a good while before I had the honour of a &s;eat in this Hou&s;e. At that period the nece&s;&s;ity was e&s;tabli&s;hed of keeping up no le&s;s than twenty new regiments, with twenty colonels capable of &s;eats in this Hou&s;e. This &s;cheme was adopted with very general applau&s;e from all &s;ides, at the very time that, by your conque&s;ts in America, your danger from foreign at|tempts in that part of the world was much le&s;&s;ened, or indeed rather quite over. When this huge encrea&s;e of military e&s;tabli&s;hment was re&s;olved on, a revenue was to be found to &s;upport &s;o great a burthen. Country gentlemen, the great patrons of occonomy, and the great re&s;i&s;ters of a &s;tanding armed force, would not have entered with much alacrity into the vote for &s;o large and &s;o expen&s;ive an army, if they had been very &s;ure, that they were to continue to pay for it. But hopes of another kind were held out to them; and in particular, I well remember, that Mr. Town&s;hend, in a brilliant harangue on this &s;ubject, did dazzle them, by playing before their eyes the image of a revenue to be rai&s;ed in America.</P>
<P>Here began to dawn the fir&s;t glimmerings of this new Colony &s;y&s;tem. It appeared more di&s;tinctly afterwards, when it was de|volved upon a per&s;on to whom, on other accounts, this Country owes very great obligations. I do believe, that he had a very &s;eri|ous de&s;ire to benefit the public. But with no &s;mall &s;tudy of the detail,
<PB N="25" REF="28">
he did not &s;eem to have his view, at lea&s;t equally, carried to the total circuit of its affairs. He generally con&s;idered his objects in lights that were rather too detached. Whether the bu&s;ine&s;s of an American revenue was impo&s;ed upon him altogether; whether it was entirely the re&s;ult of his own &s;peculation; or what is more pro|bable, that his own ideas rather coincided with the in&s;tructions he had received; certain it is, that, with the be&s;t intentions in the world, he fir&s;t brought this fatal &s;cheme into form, and e&s;tabli&s;hed it by act of parliament.</P>
<P>No man can believe, that at this time of day I mean to lean on the venerable memory of a great man, who&s;e lo&s;s we deplore in common. Our little party-differences have been long ago com|po&s;ed; and I have acted more with him, and certainly with more plea&s;ure with him, than ever I acted again&s;t him. Undoubtedly Mr. Grenville was a fir&s;t-rate figure in this country. With a ma&s;culine under&s;tanding, and a &s;tout and re&s;olute heart, he had an application undi&s;&s;ipated and unwearied. He took public bu&s;ine&s;s, not as a duty which he was to fulfil, but as a plea&s;ure he was to en|joy; and he &s;eemed to have no delight out of this Hou&s;e, except in &s;uch things as &s;ome way related to the bu&s;ine&s;s that was to be done within it. If he was ambitious, I will &s;ay this for him, his ambi|tion was of a noble and generous &s;train. It was to rai&s;e him&s;elf, not by the low pimping politics of a court, but to win his way to power, through the laborious gradations of public &s;ervice; and to &s;ecure to him&s;elf a well-earned rank in Parliament, by a thorough knowledge of its con&s;titution, and a perfect practice in all its bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Sir, if &s;uch a man fell into errors, it mu&s;t be from defects not intrin&s;ical; they mu&s;t be rather &s;ought in the particular habits of his life; which, though they do not alter the ground-work of character, yet tinge it with their own hue. He was bred in a pro|fe&s;&s;ion. He was bred to the law, which is, in my opinion, one of the fir&s;t and noble&s;t of human &s;ciences; a &s;cience which does more to quicken and invigorate the under&s;tanding, than all the other kinds of learning put together; but it is not apt, except in per&s;ons very happily born, to open and to liberalize the mind
<PB N="26" REF="29">
exactly in the &s;ame proportion. Pa&s;&s;ing from that &s;tudy he did not go very largely into the world; but plunged into bu&s;ine&s;s; I mean into the bu&s;ine&s;s of office; and the limited and fixed methods and forms e&s;tabli&s;hed there. Much knowledge is to be had un|doubtedly in that line; and there is no knowledge which is not valuable. But it may be truly &s;aid, that men too much conver&s;ant in office, are rarely minds of remarkable enlargement. Their habits of office are apt to give them a turn to think the &s;ub&s;tance of bu&s;i|ne&s;s not to be much more important than the forms in which it is conducted. The&s;e forms are adapted to ordinary occa&s;ions; and therefore per&s;ons who are nurtured in office do admirably well, as long as things go on in their common order; but when the high roads are broken up, and the waters out, when a new and troubled &s;cene is opened, and the file affords no precedent, then it is that a greater knowledge of mankind, and a far more exten&s;ive compre|hen&s;ion of things, is requi&s;ite than ever office gave, or than office can ever give. Mr. Grenville thought better of the wi&s;dom and power of human legi&s;lation than in truth it de&s;erves. He conceived, and many conceived along with him, that the flouri&s;hing trade of this country was greatly owing to law and in&s;titution, and not quite &s;o much to liberty; for but too many are apt to believe re|gulation to be commerce, and taxes to be revenue. Among regu|lations, that which &s;tood fir&s;t in reputation was his idol. I mean the act of navigation. He has often profe&s;&s;ed it to be &s;o. The policy of that act is, I readily admit, in many re&s;pects well under|&s;tood. But I do &s;ay, that if the act be &s;uffered to run the full length of its principle, and is not changed and modified according to the change of times and the fluctuation of circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t do great mi&s;chief, and frequently even defeat its own purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After the war, and in the la&s;t years of it, the trade of Americ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> had encrea&s;ed far beyond the &s;peculations of the mo&s;t &s;anguine imagination. It &s;welled out on every &s;ide. It filled all its proper channels to the brim. It overflowed with a rich redundance, and breaking its banks on the right and on the left, it &s;pread out upon &s;ome places where it was indeed improper, upon others where it was only irregular. It is the nature of all greatne&s;s not to be exact; and great trade will always be attended with con&s;iderable abu&s;es.
<PB N="27" REF="30">
The contraband will always keep pace in &s;ome mea&s;ure with the fair trade. It &s;hould &s;tand as a fundamental maxim, that no vul|gar precaution ought to be employed in the cure of evils, which are clo&s;ely connected with the cau&s;e of our pro&s;perity. Perhaps this great per&s;on turned his eye &s;omewhat le&s;s than was ju&s;t, to|wards the incredible increa&s;e of the fair trade; and looked with &s;omething of too exqui&s;ite a jealou&s;y towards the contraband. He certainly felt a &s;ingular degree of anxiety on the &s;ubject; and even began to act from that pa&s;&s;ion earlier than is commonly ima|gined. For whil&s;t he was fir&s;t lord of the admiralty, though not &s;trictly called upon in his official line, he pre&s;ented a very &s;trong memorial to the lords of the trea&s;ury; (my lord Bute was then at the head of the board) heavily complaining of the growth of the illicit commerce in America. Some mi&s;chief happened even at that time from this over-earne&s;t zeal. Much greater happened afterwards when it operated with greater power in the highe&s;t department of the finances. The bonds of the act of navigation were &s;traitned &s;o much, that America was on the point of having no trade, either contraband or legitimate. They found, under the con&s;truction and execution then u&s;ed, the act no longer tying but actually &s;trangling them. All this coming with new enumerations of commodities; with regulations which in a manner put a &s;top to the mutual coa&s;ting intercour&s;e of the Colonies; with the appoint|ment of courts of admiralty under various improper circum&s;tances; with a &s;udden extinction of the paper currencies; with a compul|&s;ory provi&s;ion for the quartering of &s;oldiers, the people of America thought them&s;elves proceeded again&s;t as delinquents, or at be&s;t as people under &s;u&s;picion of delinquency; and in &s;uch a manner, as they imagined, their recent &s;ervices in the war did not at all merit. Any of the&s;e innumerable regulations, perhaps, would not have alarmed alone; &s;ome might be thought rea&s;onable; the multitude &s;truck them with terror.</P>
<P>But the grand manoeuvre in that bu&s;ine&s;s of new regulating the colonies, was the 15th act of the fourth of George III.; which, be&s;ides containing &s;everal of the matters to which I have ju&s;t al|luded, opened a new principle: and here properly began the &s;econd period of the policy of this country with regard to the Colonies;
<PB N="28" REF="31">
by which the &s;cheme of a regular plantation parliamentary revenue was adopted in theory, and &s;ettled in practice. A revenue not &s;ub|&s;tituted in the place of, but &s;uperadded to, a monopoly; which monopoly was enforced at the &s;ame time with additional &s;trictne&s;s, and the execution put into military hands.</P>
<P>This act, Sir, had for the fir&s;t time the title of<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "granting duties in the Colonies and Plantations of America;"</Q> and for the fir&s;t time it was a&s;&s;erted in the preamble, that it was <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that a revenue &s;hould be rai&s;ed there." Then came the technical words of <Q REND="inline">"giving and granting;"</Q> and thus a complete American re|venue act was made in all the forms, and with a full avowal of the right, equity, policy, and even nece&s;&s;ity of taxing the Colonies, without any formal con&s;ent of theirs. There are contained al&s;o in the preamble to that act the&s;e very remakable words&mdash;the Com|mons, &amp;c.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"being de&s;irous to make <HI>&s;ome</HI> provi&s;ion in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament <HI>towards</HI> rai&s;ing the &s;aid revenue."</Q> By the&s;e words it appeared to the Colonies, that this act was but a beginning of &s;orrows; that every &s;e&s;&s;ion was to produce &s;omething of the &s;ame kind; that we were to go on from day to day, in charging them with &s;uch taxes as we plea&s;ed, for &s;uch a military force as we &s;hould think proper. Had this plan been pur&s;ued, it was evident that the provincial a&s;&s;emblies, in which the Americans felt all their portion of importance, and beheld their &s;ole image of freedom were <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> annihilated. This ill pro&s;pect before them &s;eemed to be boundle&s;s in extent, and endle&s;s in duration. Sir, they were not mi&s;taken. The Mini&s;try valued them&s;elves when this act pa&s;&s;ed, and when they gave notice of the Stamp Act, that both of the duties came very &s;hort of their ideas of American taxation. Great was the applau&s;e of this mea&s;ure here. In England we cried out for new taxes on America, whil&s;t they cried out that they were nearly cru&s;hed with tho&s;e which the war and their own grants had brought upon them.</P>
<P>Sir, it has been &s;aid in the debate, that when the fir&s;t American revenue act, (the act in 1764, impo&s;ing the port duties) pa&s;&s;ed, the Americans did not object to the principle. It is true they touched it but very tenderly. It was not a direct attack. They
<PB N="29" REF="32">
were, it is true, as yet novices; as yet unaccum&s;tomed to direct at|tacks upon any of the rights of Parliament. The duties were port duties, like tho&s;e they had been accu&s;tomed to bear; with this difference, that the title was not the &s;ame, the preamble not the &s;ame, and the &s;pirit altogether unlike. But of what &s;ervice is this ob&s;ervation to the cau&s;e of tho&s;e that make it? It is a full refutation of the pretence for their pre&s;ent cruelty to America; for it &s;hews, out of their own mouths, that our Colonies were backward to enter into the pre&s;ent vexatious and ruinous controver&s;y.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another circulation abroad, (&s;pread with a malig|nant intention, which I cannot attribute to tho&s;e who &s;ay the &s;ame thing in this hou&s;e) that Mr. Grenville gave the Colony agents an option for their a&s;&s;emblies to tax them&s;elves, which they had re|fu&s;ed. I find that much &s;tre&s;s is laid on this, as a fact. However, it happens neither to be true nor po&s;&s;ible. I will ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that Mr. Grenville never thought &s;it to make this apology for him&s;elf in the innumerable debates that were had upon the &s;ubject. He might have propo&s;ed to the Colony agents, that they &s;hould agree in &s;ome <HI>mode</HI> of taxation as the ground of an Act of Parliament. But he never could have propo&s;ed that they &s;hould tax them&s;elves on requi&s;ition, which is the a&s;&s;ertion of the day. Indeed, Mr. Grenville well knew, that the Colony agents could have no gene|ral powers to con&s;ent to it; and they had no time to con&s;ult their a&s;&s;emblies for particular powers, before he pa&s;&s;ed his fir&s;t revenue act. If you compare dates, you will find it impo&s;&s;ible. Burthened as the agents knew the Colonies were at that time, they could not give the lea&s;t hope of &s;uch grants. His own favourite gover|nour was of opinion that the Americans were not then taxable objects.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Nor was the time le&s;s favourable to the</HI> equity <HI>of &s;uch a taxation.

<P>The&s;e are the words of Governor Bernard's Letter to a member of the old mini&s;try, and which he has &s;ince printed. Mr. Gren|ville could not have made this propo&s;ition to the agents for another rea&s;on. He was of opinion, which he has declared in this Hou&s;e an hundred times, that the Colonies could not legally grant any revenue to the Crown; and that infinite mi&s;chiefs would be the con&s;equence of &s;uch a power. When Mr. Grenville had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t revenue act, and in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion had made this Hou&s;e come to a re&s;olution for laying a &s;tamp-duty on America, between that time and the pa&s;&s;ing the &s;tamp-act into a law, he told a con&s;iderable and mo&s;t re&s;pectable merchant, a member of this Hou&s;e, whom I am truly &s;orry I do not now &s;ee in his place, when he repre&s;ented again&s;t this proceeding, that if the &s;tamp-duty was di&s;liked, he was willing to exchange it for any other equally productive; but that if he objected to the Americans being taxed by Parliament, he might &s;ave them the trouble of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as he was determined on the mea&s;ure. This is the fact, and, if you plea&s;e, I will mention a very unque&s;tionable authority for it.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have di&s;po&s;ed of this fal&s;ehood. But fal&s;ehood has a perennial &s;pring. It is &s;aid, that no conjecture could be made of the di&s;like of the Colonies to the principle. This is as untrue as the other. After the re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e, and before the pa&s;&s;ing of the &s;tamp-act, the Colonies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay and New York did &s;end remon&s;trances, objecting to this mode of par|liamentary taxation. What was the con&s;equence? They were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; they were put under the table; notwith&s;tanding an order of council to the contrary, by the mini&s;try which com|po&s;ed the very council that had made the order; and thus the Hou&s;e proceeded to its bu&s;ine&s;s of taxing without the lea&s;t regular knowledge of the objections which were made to it. But to give that Hou&s;e its due, it was not over de&s;irous to receive informa|tion,
<PB N="31" REF="34">
or to hear remon&s;trance. On the 15th of February, 1765, whil&s;t the &s;tamp-act was under deliberation, they refu&s;ed with &s;corn even &s;o much as to receive four petitions pre&s;ented from &s;o re&s;pectable Colonies as Connecticut, Rhode I&s;land, Virginia, and Carolina; be&s;ides one from the traders of Jamaica. As to the Colonies, they had no alternative left to them, but to di&s;obey; or to pay the taxes impo&s;ed by that Parliament which was not &s;uffered, or did not &s;uffer it&s;elf, even to hear them remon&s;trate upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>This was the &s;tate of the Colonies before his Maje&s;ty thought fit to change his mini&s;ters. It &s;tands upon no authority of mine. It is proved by uncontrovertible records. The Hon. Gentleman has de&s;ired &s;ome of us to lay our hands upon our hearts and an|&s;wer to his queries upon the hi&s;torical part of this con&s;ideration; and by his manner (as well as my eyes could di&s;cern it) he &s;eemed to addre&s;s him&s;elf to me.</P>
<P>Sir, I will an&s;wer him as clearly as I am able, and with great openne&s;s: I have nothing to conceal. In the year &s;ixty-five, being in a very private &s;tation, far enough from any line of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and not having the honour of a &s;eat in this Hou&s;e, it was my fortune, unknowing and unknown to the then mini&s;try, by the intervention of a common friend, to become connected with a very noble per&s;on, and at the head of the Trea&s;ury department. It was indeed in a &s;ituation of little rank and no con&s;equence, &s;uitable to the mediocrity of my talents and preten|&s;ions. But a &s;ituation near enough to enable me to &s;ee, as well as others, what was going on; and I did &s;ee in that noble per&s;on &s;uch &s;ound principles, &s;uch an enlargement of mind, &s;uch a clear and &s;agacious &s;en&s;e, and &s;uch un&s;haken fortitude, as have bound me, as well as others much better than me, by an inviolable attach|ment to him from that time forward. Sir, Lord Rockingham very early in that &s;ummer received a &s;trong repre&s;entation from many weighty Engli&s;h merchants and manufacturers, from governors of provinces and commanders of men of war, again&s;t almo&s;t the whole of the American commercial regulations: and particularly with regard to the total ruin which was threatened to the Spani&s;h trade. I believe, Sir, the noble Lord &s;oon &s;aw his way in this
<PB N="32" REF="35">
bu&s;ine&s;s. But he did not ra&s;hly determine again&s;t acts which it might be &s;uppo&s;ed were the re&s;ult of much deliberation. However, Sir, he &s;carcely begun to open the ground, when the whole veteran body of office took the alarm. A violent outcry of all (except tho&s;e who knew and felt the mi&s;chief) was rai&s;ed again&s;t any alte|ration. On one hand, his attempt was a direct violation of treaties and public law.&mdash;On the other, the Act of Navigation and all the corps of trade laws were drawn up in array again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep the noble Lord took, was to have the opinion of his excellent, learned, and ever lamented friend the late Mr. Yorke, then attorney general, on the point of law. When he knew that formally and officially, which in &s;ub&s;tance he had known before, he immediately di&s;patched orders to redre&s;s the grievance. But I will &s;ay it for the then mini&s;ter, he is of that con&s;titution of mind, that I know he would have i&s;&s;ued, on the &s;ame critical occa&s;ion, the very &s;ame orders, if the Acts of Trade had been, as they were not, directly again&s;t him; and would have chearfully &s;ubmitted to the equity of Parliament for his indem|nity.</P>
<P>On the conclu&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s of the Spani&s;h trade, the news of the troubles, on account of the &s;tamp-act, arrived in England. It was not until the end of October that the&s;e accounts were received. No &s;ooner had the &s;ound of that mighty tempe&s;t reached us in England, than the whole of the then oppo&s;ition, in&s;tead of feeling humbled by the unhappy i&s;&s;ue of their mea&s;ures, &s;eemed to be infinitely elated, and cried out, that the mini&s;try, from envy to the glory of their predece&s;&s;ors, were prepared to repeal the &s;tamp-act. Near nine years after, the Hon. Gentleman takes quite oppo&s;ite ground, and now challenges me to put my hand to my heart, and &s;ay, whether the mini&s;try had re&s;olved on the repeal till a con&s;ider|able time after the meeting of Parliament. Though I do not very well know what the Hon. Gentleman wi&s;hes to infer from the admi&s;&s;ion, or from the denial, of this fact, on which he &s;o earne&s;tly adjures me; I do put my hand on my heart, and a&s;&s;ure him, that they did <HI>not</HI> come to a re&s;olution directly to repeal. They weighed this matter as its difficulty and importance required. They con|&s;idered
<PB N="33" REF="36">
maturely among them&s;elves. They con&s;ulted with all who could give advice or information. It was not determined until a little before the meeting of Parliament; but it was determined, and the main lines of their own plan marked out before that meeting. Two que&s;tions aro&s;e (I hope I am not to go into a narrative trouble&s;ome to the Hou&s;e)</P>
<P>[A cry of, Go on, go on.]</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the two con&s;iderations was, whether the repeal &s;hould be total, or whether only partial; taking out every thing burthen|&s;ome and productive, and re&s;erving only an empty acknowledgement, &s;uch as a &s;tamp on cards or dice. The other que&s;tion was, On what principle the act &s;hould be repealed? On this head al&s;o two prin|ciples were &s;tarted. One, that the legi&s;lative rights of this country, with regard to America, were not entire, but had certain re&s;trictions and limitations. The other principle was, that taxes of this kind were contrary to the fundamental principles of commerce on which the Colonies were founded; and contrary to every idea of political equity; by which equity we are bound, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to extend the &s;pirit and benefit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution to every part of the Briti&s;h dominions. The option, both of the mea&s;ure and of the principles of repeal, was made before the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and I wonder how any one can read the King's Speech at the opening of that &s;e&s;&s;ion, without &s;eeing in that Speech both the repeal and the declaratory act very &s;ufficiently crayoned out. Tho&s;e who cannot &s;ee this can &s;ee nothing.</P>
<P>Surely the Hon. Gentleman will not think that a great deal le&s;s time than was then employed, ought to have been &s;pent in delibe|beration; when he con&s;iders that the news of the troubles did not arrive till towards the end of October. The Parliament &s;at to fill the vacancies on the 14th day of December, and on bu&s;ine&s;s the 14th of the following January.</P>
<P>Sir, a partial repeal, or, as the <HI>bon ton</HI> of the court then was, a <HI>modification</HI> would have &s;atisfied a timid, un&s;y&s;tematic, procra&s;ti|nating mini&s;try, as &s;uch a mea&s;ure has &s;ince done &s;uch a mini&s;try.
<PB N="34" REF="37">
A modification is the con&s;tant re&s;ource of weak undeciding minds. To repeal by a denial of our right to tax in the preamble (and this too did not want advi&s;ers), would have cut, in the heroic &s;tyle, the Gordian knot with a &s;word. Either mea&s;ure would have co&s;t no more than a day's debate. But when the total repeal was adopted; and adopted on principles of policy, of equity, and of commerce; this plan made it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into many and difficult mea&s;ures. It became nece&s;&s;ary to open a very large field of evidence commen&s;urate to the&s;e exten&s;ive views. But then this labour did knights &s;ervice. It opened the eyes of &s;everal to the true &s;tate of the American affairs; it enlarged their ideas; it removed prejudices; and it conciliated the opinions and affections of men. The noble Lord, who then took the lead in admini&s;tration, my Hon. Friend<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dowde&s;well.</NOTE> under me, and a Right Hon. Gentleman<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE> (if he will not reject his &s;hare, and it was a large one of this bu&s;ine&s;s) exerted the mo&s;t laudable indu&s;try in bringing before you the fulle&s;t, mo&s;t impartial, and lea&s;t-garbled body of evidence that ever was produced to this Hou&s;e. I think the enquiry la&s;ted in the Committee for &s;ix weeks; and at its conclu&s;ion this Hou&s;e, by an independent, noble, &s;pirited, and unexpected majority; by a ma|jority that will redeem all the acts ever done by majorities in Par|liament; in the teeth of all the old mercenary Swi&s;s of &s;tate, in de&s;pite of all the &s;peculators and augurs of political events, in de|fiance of the whole embattled legion of veteran pen&s;ioners and practi&s;ed in&s;truments of a court, gave a total repeal to the &s;tamp|act, and (if it had been &s;o permitted) a la&s;ting peace to this whole empire.</P>
<P>I &s;tate, Sir, the&s;e particulars, becau&s;e this act of &s;pirit and for|titude has lately been, in the circulation of the &s;ea&s;on, and in &s;ome hazarded declamations in this Hou&s;e, attributed to timi|dity. If, Sir, the conduct of mini&s;try, in propo&s;ing the repeal, had ari&s;en from timidity with regard to them&s;elves, it would have been greatly to be condemned. Intere&s;ted timidity di&s;graces as much in the cabinet, as per&s;onal timidity does in the field. But timidity, with regard to the well-being of our country, is heroic
<PB N="35" REF="38">
virtue. The noble Lord who then conducted affairs, and his worthy collegues, whil&s;t they trembled at the pro&s;pect of &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es as you have &s;ince brought upon your&s;elves, was not afraid &s;teadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence at which the eyes of eagles have blenched. He looked in the face one of the able&s;t, and, let me &s;ay, not the mo&s;t &s;crupulous op|po&s;itions, that perhaps ever was in this Hou&s;e, and with&s;tood it; unaided by, even one of, the u&s;ual &s;upports of admini&s;tration. He did this when he repealed the &s;tamp-act. He looked in the face a per&s;on he had long re&s;pected and regarded, and who&s;e aid was then particularly wanting; I mean Lord Chatham. He did this when he pa&s;&s;ed the declaratory act.</P>
<P>It is now given out, for the u&s;ual purpo&s;es, by the u&s;ual emi&s;|&s;aries, that Lord Rockingham did not con&s;ent to the repeal of this act until he was bullied into it by Lord Chatham; and the reporters have gone &s;o far as publickly to a&s;&s;ert, in an hundred companies, that the Hon. Gentleman under the gallery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE>, who pro|po&s;ed the repeal in the American committee, had another &s;ett of re&s;olutions in his pocket directly the rever&s;e of tho&s;e he moved. The&s;e artifices of a de&s;perate cau&s;e are, at this time, &s;pread abroad, with incredible care, in every part of the town, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t companies; as if the indu&s;try of the circula|tion were to make amends for the ab&s;urdity of the report.</P>
<P>Sir, whether the noble Lord is of a complexion to be bullied by Lord Chatham, or by any man, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to tho&s;e who know him. I confe&s;s, when I look back to that time, I con&s;ider him as placed in one of the mo&s;t trying &s;ituations in which, perhaps, any man ever &s;tood. In the Hou&s;e of Peers there were very few of the mini&s;try, out of the noble Lord's own particular connexion, (except Lord Egmont, who acted, as far as I could di&s;cern, an honour|able and manly part,) that did not look to &s;ome other future arrangement, which warped his politicks. There were in both hou&s;es new and menacing appearances, that might very naturally drive any other, than a mo&s;t re&s;olute mini&s;ter, from his mea&s;ure,
<PB N="36" REF="39">
or from his &s;tation. The hou&s;ehold troops openly revolted. The allies of mini&s;try (tho&s;e, I mean, who &s;upported &s;ome of their mea&s;ures, but refu&s;ed re&s;pon&s;ibility for any) endeavoured to under|mine their credit, and to take ground that mu&s;t be fatal to the &s;uccce&s;s of the very cau&s;e which they would be thought to coun|tenance. The que&s;tion of the repeal was brought on by mini&s;try in the Committee of this Hou&s;e, in the very in&s;tant when it was known that more than one court negotiation was carrying on with the heads of the oppo&s;ition. Every thing, upon every &s;ide, was full of traps and mines. Earth below &s;hook; heaven above menaced; all the elements of mini&s;terial &s;afety were di&s;|&s;olved. It was in the mid&s;t of this chaos of plots and counter|plots; it was in the mid&s;t of this complicated warfare again&s;t public oppo&s;ition and private treachery, that the firmne&s;s of that noble Per&s;on was put to the proof. He never &s;tirred from his ground; no, not an inch. He remained fixed and determined, in principle, in mea&s;ure, and in conduct. He practi&s;ed no ma|nagements. He &s;ecured no retreat. He &s;ought no apology.</P>
<P>I will likewi&s;e do ju&s;tice, I ought to do it, to the Hon. Gentle|man who led us in this Hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE>. Far from the duplicity wickedly charged on him, he acted his part with alacrity and re&s;olution. We all felt in&s;pired by the example he gave us, down even to my&s;elf, the weake&s;t in that phalanx. I declare for one, I knew well enough (it could not be concealed from any body) the true &s;tate of things; but, in my life, I never came with &s;o much &s;pi|rits into this Hou&s;e. It was a time for a <HI>man</HI> to act in. We had powerful enemies; but we had faithful and determined friends; and a glorious cau&s;e. We had a great battle to fight; but we had the means of fighting; not as now, when our arms are tied behind us. We did fight that day and conquer.</P>
<P>I remember, Sir, with a melancholy plea&s;ure, the &s;ituation of the Hon. Gentleman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE> who made the motion for the repeal; in that cri&s;is, when the whole trading intere&s;t of this empire crammed into your lobbies, with a trembling and anxious expectation, waited,
<PB N="37" REF="40">
almo&s;t to a winter's return of light, their fate from your re&s;olu|tions. When, at length, you had determined in their favour, and your doors, thrown open, &s;hewed them the figure of their deli|verer in the well-earned triumph of his important victory, from the whole of that grave multitude there aro&s;e an involuntary bur&s;t of gratitude and tran&s;port. They jumped upon him like children on a long ab&s;ent father. They clung about him as captives about their redeemer. All England, all America joined in his applau&s;e. Nor did he &s;eem in&s;en&s;ible to the be&s;t of all earthly rewards, the love and admiration of his fellow-citizens. <HI>Hope elevated and joy brightened his cre&s;t.</HI> I &s;tood near him; and his face, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of the Scripture of the fir&s;t martyr,<Q REND="inline margQuotes"> "his face was as if it had been the face of an angel."</Q> I do not know how others feel; but if I had &s;tood in that &s;ituation, I never would have exchanged it for all that kings in their profu&s;ion could be&s;tow. I did hope, that that day's danger and honour would have been a bond to hold us all together for ever. But, alas! that, with other plea&s;ing vi&s;ions, is long &s;ince vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>Sir, this act of &s;upreme magnanimity has been repre&s;ented, as if it had been a mea&s;ure of an admini&s;tration, that, having no &s;cheme of their own, took a middle line, pilfered a bit from one &s;ide and a bit from the other. Sir, they took <HI>no</HI> middle lines. They dif|fered fundamentally from the &s;chemes of both parties; but they pre&s;erved the objects of both. They pre&s;erved the authority of Great Britain. They pre&s;erved the equity of Great Britain. They made the declaratory act; they repealed the &s;tamp act. They did both <HI>fully</HI>; becau&s;e the declaratory act was <HI>without qualification</HI>; and the repeal of the &s;tamp act <HI>total.</HI> This they did in the &s;itua|tion I have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, what will the adver&s;ary &s;ay to both the&s;e acts? If the principle of the declaratory act was not good, the principle we are contending for this day is mon&s;trous. If the principle of the repeal was not good, why are we not at war for a real &s;ub|&s;tantial effective revenue? If both were bad; why has this mini&s;try incurred all the inconveniences of both and of all &s;chemes? Why
<PB N="38" REF="41">
have they enacted, repealed, enforced, yielded, and now attempt to enforce again?</P>
<P>Sir, I think I may as well now, as at any other time, &s;peak to a certain matter of fact not wholly unrelated to the que&s;tion under your con&s;ideration. We, who would per&s;uade you to revert to the antient policy of this kingdom, labour under the effect of this &s;hort current phra&s;e, which the court leaders have given out to all their corps, in order to take away the credit of tho&s;e who would prevent you from that frantic war you are going to wage upon your Colonies. Their cant is this; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All the di&s;|turbances in America have been created by the repeal of the Stamp Act."</Q> I &s;uppre&s;s for a moment my indignation at the fal&s;ehood, ba&s;ene&s;s, and ab&s;urdity of this mo&s;t audacious a&s;&s;ertion. In&s;tead of remarking on the motives and character of tho&s;e who have i&s;&s;ued it for circulation, I will clearly lay before you the &s;tate of America, antecedently to that repeal; after the repeal; and &s;ince the renewal of the &s;chemes of American taxation.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that the di&s;turbances, if there were any, before the repeal, were &s;light; and without difficulty or inconvenience might have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. For an an&s;wer to this a&s;&s;ertion I will &s;end you to the great author and patron of the Stamp Act, who certainly meaning well to the authority of this Country, and fully apprized of the &s;tate of that, made, before a repeal was &s;o much as agitated in this Hou&s;e, the motion which is on your Journals; and which, to &s;ave the Clerk the trouble of turning to it, I will now read to you. It was for an amendment to the addre&s;s of the 17th of December 1765, <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"<HI>To expre&s;s our ju&s;t re&s;entment and indignation at the</HI> outrageous tumults and in&s;urrections <HI>which have been excited and carried on in North America; and at the re&s;i&s;tance given by</HI> open <HI>and</HI> rebel|lious <HI>force to the execution of the laws in that part of his Maje&s;ty's dominions.

<P>Here was certainly a di&s;turbance preceding the repeal; &s;uch a di&s;turbance as Mr. Grenville thought nece&s;&s;ary to qualify by the name of an <HI>in&s;urrection,</HI> and the epithet of a <HI>rebellious</HI> force: terms much &s;tronger than any, by which, tho&s;e who then &s;upported his motion, have ever &s;ince thought proper to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;turbances in America. They were di&s;turbances which &s;eemed to him and his friends to ju&s;tify as &s;trong a promi&s;e of &s;upport, as hath been u&s;ual to give in the beginning of a war with the mo&s;t powerful and declared enemies. When the accounts of the American Go|vernors came before the Hou&s;e, they appeared &s;tronger even than the warmth of public imagination had painted them; &s;o much &s;tronger, that the papers on your table bear me out in &s;aying, that all the late di&s;turbances, which have been at one time the Mini|&s;ter's motives for the repeal of five out of &s;ix of the new court taxes, and are now his pretences for refu&s;ing to repeal that &s;ixth, did not amount&mdash;why do I compare them? no, not to a tenth part of the tumults and violence which prevailed long before the repeal of that act.</P>
<P>Mini&s;try cannot refu&s;e the authority of the commander in chief General Gage, who, in his Letter of the 4th of November, from New York, thus repre&s;ents the &s;tate of things: <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"<HI>It is difficult to &s;ay, from the</HI> highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, <HI>who has not been</HI> acce&s;&s;ory <HI>to this</HI> in&s;urrection, <HI>either by writing or</HI> mutual agreements <HI>to oppo&s;e the act, by what they are plea&s;ed to term all legal oppo&s;ition to it.

<P><PB N="40" REF="43">It is remarkable, Sir, that the per&s;ons who formerly trumpeted forth the mo&s;t loudly, the violent re&s;olutions of a&s;&s;emblies; the univer&s;al in&s;urrections; the &s;eizing and burning the &s;tamped papers; the forcing &s;tamp officers to re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions under the gallows; the rifling and pulling down of the hou&s;es of magi&s;trates; and the expul&s;ion from their country of all who dared to write or &s;peak a &s;ingle word in defence of the powers of parliament; the&s;e very trumpeters are now the men that repre&s;ent the whole as a mere trifle; and choo&s;e to date all the di&s;turbances from the repeal of the &s;tamp act, which put an end to to them.

<P>Sir, this vermin of court reporters, when they are forced into day upon one point, are &s;ure to burrow in another; but they &s;hall have no refuge: I will make them bolt out of all their holes. Con|&s;cious that they mu&s;t be baffled, when they attribute a precedent di&s;turbance to a &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ure, they take other ground almo&s;t as ab&s;urd, but very common in modern practice, and very wicked; which is, to attribute the ill effect of ill-judged conduct to the arguments which had been u&s;ed to di&s;&s;uade us from it. They &s;ay, that the oppo&s;ition made in parliament to the &s;tamp act at the time of its pa&s;&s;ing, encouraged the Americans to their re&s;i&s;tance. This has even formally appeared in print in a regular volume, from an advocate of that faction, a Dr. Tucker. This Dr. Tucker is already a dean, and his earne&s;t labours in this vineyard will, I &s;up|po&s;e, rai&s;e him to a bi&s;hoprick. But this a&s;&s;ertion too, ju&s;t like the re&s;t, is fal&s;e. In all the papers which have loaded your table; in all the va&s;t crowd of verbal witne&s;&s;es that appeared at your bar, witne&s;&s;es which were indi&s;criminately produced from both &s;ides of the Hou&s;e; not the lea&s;t hint of &s;uch a cau&s;e of di&s;turbance has ever appeared. As to the fact of a &s;trenuous oppo&s;ition to the
<PB N="41" REF="44">
&s;tamp act, I &s;at as a &s;tranger in your gallery when the act was under con&s;ideration. Far from any thing inflammatory, I never heard a more languid debate in this Hou&s;e. No more than two or three gentlemen, as I remember, &s;poke again&s;t the act, and that with great re&s;erve and remarkable temper. There was but one divi&s;ion in the whole progre&s;s of the bill; and the minority did not reach to more than 39 or 40. In the Hou&s;e of Lords I do not recollect that there was any debate or divi&s;ion at all. I am &s;ure there was no prote&s;t. In fact, the affair pa&s;&s;ed with &s;o very, very little noi&s;e, that in town they &s;carcely knew the nature of what you were do|ing. The oppo&s;ition to the bill in England never could have done this mi&s;chief, becau&s;e there &s;carcely ever was le&s;s of oppo&s;ition to a bill of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Sir, the agents and di&s;tributors of fal&s;ehoods have, with their u&s;ual indu&s;try, circulated another lye of the &s;ame nature with the former. It is this, that the di&s;turbances aro&s;e from the account which had been received in America of the change in the mini&s;try. No longer awed, it &s;eems, with the &s;pirit of the former rulers, they thought them&s;elves a match for what our calumniators choo&s;e to qualify by the name of &s;o feeble a mini&s;try as &s;ucceeded. Feeble in one &s;en&s;e the&s;e men certainly may be called; for with all their efforts, and they have made many, they have not been able to re&s;i&s;t the di&s;tempered vigour, and in&s;ane alacrity with which you are ru&s;h|ing to your ruin. But it does &s;o happen, that the fal&s;ity of this circu|lation is (like the re&s;t) demon&s;trated by indi&s;putable dates and records.</P>
<P>So little was the change known in America, that the letters of your governors, giving an account of the&s;e di&s;turbances long after they had arrived at their highe&s;t pitch, were all directed to the <HI>Old Mini&s;try,</HI> and particularly to the <HI>Earl of Halifax,</HI> the &s;ecretary of &s;tate corre&s;ponding with the Colonies, without once in the &s;malle&s;t degree intimating the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any mini&s;terial revolu|tion what&s;oever. The mini&s;try was not changed in England until the tenth day of July 1765. On the 14th of the preceding June, Governor Fauquier from Virginia writes thus; and writes thus to the Earl of Halifax: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Government is &s;et at</HI> defiance, <HI>not having &s;trength enough in her hands to enforce obedience to the laws of the</HI>

Similar accounts, and of as late a date, were &s;ent from other governors, and all directed to Lord Halifax. Not one of the&s;e letters indicates the &s;lighte&s;t idea of a change either known, or even apprehended.</P>
<P>Thus are blown away the infect race of courtly fal&s;ehoods! thus peri&s;h the mi&s;erable inventions of the wretched runners for a wretched cau&s;e, which they have fly-blown into every weak and rotten part of the country, in vain hopes that when their maggots had taken wing, their importunate buzzing might &s;ound &s;ome|thing like the public voice!</P>
<P>Sir, I have troubled you &s;ufficiently with the &s;tate of America before the repeal. Now I turn to the Hon. Gentleman who &s;o &s;toutly challenges us, to tell, whether, after the repeal, the Pro|vinces were quiet? This is coming home to the point. Here I meet him directly; and an&s;wer mo&s;t readily, <HI>They were quiet.</HI> And I, in my turn, challenge him to prove when, and where, and by whom, and in what numbers, and with what violence, the other laws of trade, as gentlemen a&s;&s;ert, were violated in con|&s;equence of your conce&s;&s;ion? or that even your other revenue laws were attacked? But I quit the vantage ground on which I &s;tand, and where I might leave the burthen of the proof upon him: I walk down upon the open plain, and undertake to &s;hew, that they were not only quiet, but &s;hewed many unequivocal marks of acknowledge|ment and gratitude. And to give him every advantage, I &s;elect the obnoxious Colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay, which at this time (but without hearing her) is &s;o heavily a culprit before parliament&mdash;I will &s;elect their proceedings even under circum&s;tances of no &s;mall
<PB N="43" REF="46">
irritation. For, a little imprudently I mu&s;t &s;ay, Governor Bernard mixed in the admini&s;tration of the lenitive of the repeal no &s;mall acrimony ari&s;ing from matters of a &s;eparate nature. Yet &s;ee, Sir, the effect of that lenitive, though mixed with the&s;e bitter ingre|dients; and how this rugged people can expre&s;s them&s;elves on a mea&s;ure of conce&s;&s;ion. <Q REND="inline margQuotes"><P>"<HI>If it is not now in our power</HI>" (&s;ay they in their addre&s;s to Gov. Bernard), "<HI>in &s;o full a manner as will be expected, to &s;hew our re|&s;pectful gratitude to the Mother Country, or to make a dutiful and affec|tionate return to the indulgence of the King and Parliament, it &s;hall be no fault of ours; for this we intend, and hope we &s;hall be able fully to effect.</HI>"</P></Q></P>
<P>Would to God that this temper had been cultivated, managed, and &s;et in action! other effects than tho&s;e which we have &s;ince felt would have re&s;ulted from it. On the requi&s;ition for compen&s;ation to tho&s;e who had &s;uffered from the violence of the populace, in the &s;ame addre&s;s they &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>The recommendation enjoined by Mr. Secre|tary Conway's Letter, and in con&s;equence thereof made to us, we will embrace the fir&s;t convenient opportunity to con&s;ider and act upon.</HI>"</Q> They did con&s;ider; they did act upon it. They obeyed the requi|&s;ition. I know the mode has been chicaned upon; but it was &s;ub|&s;tantially obeyed; and much better obeyed, than I fear the parlia|mentary requi&s;ition of this &s;e&s;&s;ion will be, though enforced by all your rigour, and backed with all your power. In a word, the damages of popular fury were compen&s;ated by legi&s;lative gravity. Almo&s;t every other part of America in various ways demon&s;trated their gratitude. I am bold to &s;ay, that &s;o &s;udden a calm recovered after &s;o violent a &s;torm is without parallel in hi&s;tory. To &s;ay that no other di&s;turbance &s;hould happen from any other cau&s;e is folly. But as far as appearances went, by the judicious &s;acrifice of one law, you procured an acquie&s;cence in all that remained. After this ex|perience, nobody &s;hall per&s;uade me, when an whole people are concerned, that acts of lenity are not means of conciliation.</P>
<P>I hope the Hon. Gentleman has received a fair and full an&s;wer to his que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="47">I have done with the third period of your policy; that of your repeal; and the return of your ancient &s;y&s;tem, and your antient tran|quillity and concord. Sir, this period was not as long as it was happy. Another &s;cene was opened, and other actors appeared on the &s;tage. The &s;tate, in the condition I have de&s;cribed it, was delivered into the hands of Lord Chatham&mdash;a great and celebrated name; a name that keeps the name of this country re&s;pectable in every other on the globe. It may be truly called,
<Q><L>&mdash;Clarum et venerabile nomen</L>
<L>Gentibus, et multum no&s;trae quod proderat urbi.</L></Q></P>
<P>Sir, the venerable age of this great man, his merited rank, his &s;uperior eloquence, his &s;plendid qualities, his eminent &s;ervices, the va&s;t &s;pace he fills in the eye of mankind; and, more than all the re&s;t, his fall from power, which, like death, canonizes and &s;anctifies a great character, will not &s;uffer me to cen&s;ure any part of his conduct. I am afraid to flatter him; I am &s;ure I am not di&s;po&s;ed to blame him. Let tho&s;e who have betrayed him by their adulation, in&s;ult him with their malevolence. But what I do not pre&s;ume to cen&s;ure, I may have leave to lament. For a wi&s;e man, he &s;eemed to me at that time, to be governed too much by general maxims. I &s;peak with the freedom of hi&s;tory, and I hope without offence. One or two of the&s;e maxims, flowing from an opinion not the mo&s;t indulgent to our unhappy &s;pecies, and &s;urely a little too general, led him into mea&s;ures that were greatly mi&s;chievous to him&s;elf; and for that rea&s;on, among others, perhaps fatal to his country; mea&s;ures, the effects of which, I am afraid, are for ever inurable. He made an admini&s;tration, &s;o checkered and &s;peckled; he put together a piece of joinery, &s;o cro&s;sly indented and whim&s;ically dovetailed; a cabinet &s;o variou&s;ly inlaid; &s;uch a piece of diver&s;ified Mo&s;aic; &s;uch a te&s;&s;elated pave|ment without cement; here a bit of black &s;tone, and there a bit of white; patriots and courtiers, kings friends and republicans; whigs and tories; treacherous friends and open enemies: that it was indeed a very curious &s;how; but utterly un&s;afe to touch, and un|&s;ure to &s;tand on. The colleagues whom he had a&s;&s;orted at the &s;ame boards, &s;tared at each other, and were obliged to a&s;k, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, your name?&mdash;Sir, you have the advantage of me&mdash;Mr. Such a
<PB N="45" REF="48">

<P>Sir, in con&s;equence of this arrangement, having put &s;o much the larger part of his enemies and oppo&s;ers into power, the confu&s;ion was &s;uch, that his own principles could not po&s;&s;ibly have any effect or influence in the conduct of affairs. If ever he fell into a fit of the gout, or if any orher cau&s;e withdrew him from public cares, principles directly the contrary were &s;ure to predominate. When he had executed his plan, he had not an inch of ground to &s;tand upon. When he had accompli&s;hed his &s;cheme of admini|&s;tration, he was no longer a mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>When his face was hid but for a moment, his whole &s;y&s;tem was on a wide &s;ea, without chart or compa&s;s. The gentlemen, his particular friends, who, with the names of various departments of mini&s;try, were admitted, to &s;eem, as if they acted a part under him, with a mode&s;ty that becomes all men, and with a confidence in him, which was ju&s;tified even in its extravagance by his &s;uperior abili|ties, had never, in any in&s;tance, pre&s;umed upon any opinion of their own. Deprived of his guiding influence, they were whirled about, the &s;port of every gu&s;t, and ea&s;ily driven into any port; and as tho&s;e who joined with them in manning the ve&s;&s;el were the mo&s;t directly oppo&s;ite to his opinions, mea&s;ures, and character, and far the mo&s;t artful and mo&s;t powerful of the &s;et, they ea&s;ily prevailed, &s;o as to &s;eize upon the vacant, unoccupied, and derelict minds of his friends; and in&s;tantly they turned the ve&s;&s;el wholly out of the cour&s;e of his policy. As if it were to in&s;ult as well as to betray him, even long before the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of his admini&s;tration, when every thing was publickly tran&s;acted, and with great parade in his name, they made an act, declaring it highly ju&s;t and expedient to rai&s;e a revenue in America. For even then, Sir, even before this &s;plendid orb was entirely &s;et, and while the We&s;tern horizon was in a
<PB N="46" REF="49">
blaze with his de&s;cending glory, on the oppo&s;ite quarter of the heavens aro&s;e another luminary, and, for his hour, became lord of the a&s;cendant.</P>
<P>This light too is pa&s;&s;ed and &s;et for ever. You under&s;tand, to be &s;ure, that I &s;peak of Charles Town&s;hend, officially the re-producer of this fatal &s;cheme; whom I cannot even now re|member without &s;ome degree of &s;en&s;ibility. In truth, Sir, he was the delight and ornament of this hou&s;e, and the charm of every private &s;ociety which he honoured with his pre&s;ence. Perhaps there never aro&s;e in this country, nor in any country, a man of a more pointed and fini&s;hed wit; and (where his pa&s;&s;ions were not concerned) of a more refined, exqui&s;ite, and penetrating a judgment. If he had not &s;o great a &s;tock, as &s;ome have had who flouri&s;hed formerly, of knowledge long trea&s;ured up, he knew better by far, than any man I ever was acquainted with, how to bring together within a &s;hort time, all that was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h, to illu&s;trate, and to decorate that &s;ide of the que&s;tion he &s;upported. He &s;tated his matter &s;kilfully and powerfully. He particularly excelled in a mo&s;t luminous explanation, and di&s;play of his &s;ubject. His &s;tyle of argument was neither trite and vulgar, nor &s;ubtle and ab&s;tru&s;e. He hit the hou&s;e ju&s;t between wind and water.&mdash;And not being troubled with too anxious a zeal for any matter in que&s;tion, he was never more tedious, or more earne&s;t, than the pre-conceived opinions, and pre&s;ent temper of his hearers required; to whom he was always in perfect uni&s;on. He conformed exactly to the temper of the hou&s;e; and he &s;eemed to guide, becau&s;e he was always &s;ure to follow it.</P>
<P>I beg pardon, Sir, if when I &s;peak of this and of other great men, I appear to digre&s;s in &s;aying &s;omething of their characters. In this eventful hi&s;tory of the revolutions of America, the characters of &s;uch men are of much importance. Great men are the guide-po&s;ts and land-marks in the &s;tate. The credit of &s;uch men at court, or in the nation, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of all the publick mea&s;ures. It would be an invidious thing, (mo&s;t foreign I tru&s;t to what you think my di&s;po&s;ition) to remark the errors into which the authority of great
<PB N="47" REF="50">
names has brought the nation, without doing ju&s;tice at the &s;ame time to the great qualities, whence that authority aro&s;e. The &s;ubject is in&s;tructive to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to form them&s;elves on what|ever of excellence has gone before them. There are many young members in the hou&s;e (&s;uch of late has been the rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of publick men) who never &s;aw that prodigy Charles Town&s;hend; nor of cour&s;e know what a ferment he was able to excite in every thing by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings. For failings he had undoubtedly&mdash;many of us remember them; we are this day con&s;idering the effect of them. But he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cau&s;e; to an ardent, generous, perhaps an immoderate pa&s;&s;ion for Fame; a pa&s;&s;ion which is the in&s;tinct of all great &s;ouls. He wor|&s;hiped that godde&s;s where&s;oever &s;he appeared; but he paid his par|ticular devotions to her in her favourite habitation, in her cho&s;en temple, the Hou&s;e of Commons. Be&s;ides the characters of the in|dividuals that compo&s;e our body, it is impo&s;&s;ible, Mr. Speaker, not to ob&s;erve, that this hou&s;e has a collective character of its own. That character too, however imperfect, is not unamiable. Like all great public collections of men, you po&s;&s;e&s;s a marked love of virtue, and an abhorence of vice. But among vices, there is none, which the hou&s;e abhors in the &s;ame degree with <HI>ob&s;tinacy.</HI> Ob&s;ti|nacy, Sir, is certainly a great vice; and in the changeful &s;tate of political affairs it is frequently the cau&s;e of great mi&s;chief. It hap|pens, however, very unfortunately, that almo&s;t the whole line of the great and ma&s;culine virtues, con&s;tancy, gravity, magnanimity, fortitude, fidelity, and firmne&s;s, are clo&s;ely allied to this di&s;agree|able quality, of which you have &s;o ju&s;t an abhorrence; and in their exce&s;s, all the&s;e virtues very ea&s;ily fall into it. He, who paid &s;uch a punctilious attention to all your feelings, certainly took care not to &s;hock them by that vice which is the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful to you.</P>
<P>That fear of di&s;plea&s;ing tho&s;e who ought mo&s;t to be plea&s;ed, be|trayed him &s;ometimes into the other extreme. He had voted, and in the year 1766, had been an advocate for the Stamp Act. Things and the di&s;po&s;ition of mens minds were changed. In &s;hort, the Stamp Act began to be no favourite in this hou&s;e. He therefore attended at the private meeting, in which the re&s;olutions
<PB N="48" REF="51">
moved by a Right Honourable Gentleman, were &s;ettled; re&s;olutions leading to the repeal. The next day he voted for that repeal; and he would have &s;poken for it too, if an illne&s;s, (not as was then given out a political) but to my knowledge, a very real illne&s;s, had not prevented it.</P>
<P>The very next &s;e&s;&s;ion, as the fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away, the repeal began to be in as bad an odour in this hou&s;e as the Stamp Act had been in the &s;e&s;&s;ion before. To conform to the temper which began to prevail, and to prevail mo&s;tly among&s;t tho&s;e mo&s;t in power, he declared, very early in the Winter, that a revenue mu&s;t be had out of America. In&s;tantly he was tied down to his engagements by &s;ome, who had no objection to &s;uch ex|periments, when made at the co&s;t of per&s;ons for whom they had no particular regard. The whole body of courtiers drove him onward. They always talked as if the king &s;tood in a &s;ort of hu|miliated &s;tate, until &s;omething of the kind &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>Here this extraordinary man, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, found him&s;elf in great &s;traits. To plea&s;e univer&s;ally was the ob|ject of his life; but to tax and to plea&s;e, no more than to love and to be wi&s;e, is not given to men. However he attempted it. To render the tax palatable to the partizans of American reve|nue, he made a preamble &s;tating the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a revenue. To clo&s;e with the American di&s;tinction, this revenue was an <HI>external</HI> or port-duty; but again, to &s;often it to the other party, it was a duty of <HI>&s;upply.</HI> To gratify the <HI>coloni&s;ts,</HI> it was laid on Briti&s;h manufactures; to &s;atisfy the <HI>merchants of Britain,</HI> the duty was trivial, and (except that on tea, which touched only the devoted Ea&s;t India Company) on none of the grand objects of commerce. To counterwork the American contraband, the duty on tea was reduced from a &s;hilling to three-pence. But to &s;ecure the favour of tho&s;e who would tax America, the &s;cene of collection was changed, and, with the re&s;t, it was levied in the Colonies. What need I &s;ay more? This fine-&s;pun &s;cheme had the u&s;ual fate of all exqui&s;ite policy. But the original plan of the duties, and the mode of executing that plan, both aro&s;e &s;ingly and &s;olely from a love of our applau&s;e. He was truly the child of the hou&s;e. He never thought, did, or
<PB N="49" REF="52">
&s;aid any thing but with a view to you. He every day adapted him&s;elf to your di&s;po&s;ition; and adju&s;ted him&s;elf before it, as at a looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>He had ob&s;erved (indeed it could not e&s;cape him) that &s;everal per&s;ons, infinitely his inferiors in all re&s;pects, had formerly rendered them&s;elves con&s;iderable in this hou&s;e by one method alone. They were a race of men (I hope in God the &s;pecies is extinct) who, when they ro&s;e in their place, no man living could divine, from any known adherence to parties, to opinions, or to principles; from any order or &s;y&s;tem in their politics; or from any &s;equel or connection in their ideas, what part they were going to take in any debate. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how much this uncertainty, e&s;pecially at critical times, called the attention of all parties on &s;uch men. All eyes were fixed on them, all ears open to hear them; each party gaped, and looked alternately for their vote, almo&s;t to the end of their &s;peeches. While the Hou&s;e hung in this uncertainty, now the <HI>Hear-hims</HI> ro&s;e from this &s;ide&mdash;now they re-bellowed from the other; and that party to whom they fell at length from their tremulous and dancing balance, always received them in a tempe&s;t of applau&s;e. The fortune of &s;uch men was a temptation too great to be re&s;i&s;ted by one, to whom, a &s;ingle whiff of incen&s;e withheld gave much greater pain, than he received de|light, in the clouds of it, which daily ro&s;e about him from the prodigal &s;uper&s;tition of innumerable admirers. He was a candi|date for contradictory honours; and his great aim was to make tho&s;e agree in admiration of him who never agreed in any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>Hence aro&s;e this unfortunate act, the &s;ubject of this day's debate; from a di&s;po&s;ition which, after making an American revenue to plea&s;e one, repealed it to plea&s;e others, and again revived it in hopes of plea&s;ing a third, and of catching &s;omething in the ideas of all.</P>
<P>This revenue act of 1767, formed the fourth period of American policy. How we have fared &s;ince then&mdash;what woeful variety of &s;chemes have been adopted; what enforcing, and what repealing; what bullying, and what &s;ubmitting; what doing, and undoing; what &s;training, and what relaxing; what a&s;&s;emblies di&s;&s;olved for not obeying, and called again without obedience; what troops &s;ent out
<PB N="50" REF="53">
to quell re&s;i&s;tance, and on meeting that re&s;i&s;tance, recalled; what &s;hiftings, and changes, and jumblings of all kinds of men at home, which left no po&s;&s;ibility of order, con&s;i&s;tency, vigour, or even &s;o much as a decent unity of colour in any one public mea&s;ure.&mdash;It is a tedious, irk&s;ome ta&s;k. My duty may call me to open it out &s;ome other time;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Re&s;olutions moved in May 1770.</NOTE> on a former occa&s;ion I tried your temper on a part of it; for the pre&s;ent I &s;hall forbear.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e changes and agitations, your immediate &s;ituation upon the que&s;tion on your paper is at length brought to this. You have an act of parliament, &s;tating, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is <HI>expedient</HI> to rai&s;e a revenue in America."</Q> By a partial repeal, you have an|nihilated the greate&s;t part of that revenue, which this preamble declares to be &s;o expedient. You have &s;ub&s;tituted no other in the place of it. A &s;ecretary of &s;tate has di&s;claimed, in the king's name, all thoughts of &s;uch a &s;u&s;titution in future. The principle of this di&s;claimer goes to what has been left, as well as what has been re|pealed. The tax which lingers after its companions, (under a pre|amble declaring an American revenue expedient, and for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of &s;upporting the theory of that preamble) militates with the a&s;&s;urance authentically conveyed to the Colonies; and is an ex|hau&s;tle&s;s &s;ource of jealou&s;y and animo&s;ity. On this &s;tate, which I take to be a fair one; not being able to di&s;cern any grounds of honour, advantage, peace, or power, for adhering, either to the act or to the preamble, I &s;hall vote for the que&s;tion which leads to the repeal of both.</P>
<P>If you do not fall in with this motion, then &s;ecure &s;omething to fight for, con&s;i&s;tent in theory and valuable in practice. If you mu&s;t employ your &s;trength, employ it to uphold you in &s;ome honourable right, or &s;ome profitable wrong. If you are apprehen&s;ive that the con|ce&s;&s;ion recommended to you, though proper, &s;hould be a means of drawing on you further but unrea&s;onable claims,&mdash;why then employ your force in &s;upporting that rea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ion again&s;t tho&s;e un|rea&s;onable demands. You will employ it with more grace; with better effect; and with great probable concurrence of all the quiet and rational people in the provinces; who are now united with, and hurried away by the violent; having indeed different di&s;po&s;i|tions,
<PB N="51" REF="54">
but a common intere&s;t. If you apprehend that on a conce&s;|&s;ion you &s;hall be pu&s;hed by metaphy&s;ical proce&s;s to the extreme lines, and argued out of your whole authority, my advice is this; when you have recovered, your old, your &s;trong, your tenable po&s;ition; then face about&mdash;&s;top &s;hort&mdash;do nothing more&mdash;rea&s;on not at all&mdash;oppo&s;e the antient policy and practice of the empire, as a rampart again&s;t the &s;peculations of innovators on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion; and you will &s;tand on great, manly, and &s;ure ground. On this &s;olid ba&s;is fix your machines, and they will draw worlds to|wards you.</P>
<P>Your mini&s;ters, in their own and his Maje&s;ty's name, have al|ready adopted the American di&s;tinction of internal and external du|ties. It is a di&s;tinction, whatever merit it may have, that was ori|ginally moved by the Americans them&s;elves; and I think they will acquie&s;ce in it, if they are not pu&s;hed with too much logic and too little &s;en&s;e, in all the con&s;equences. That is, if external taxation be under&s;tood, as they and you under&s;tand it when you plea&s;e, to be not a di&s;tinction of Geography, but of policy; that it is a power for regulating trade, and not for &s;upporting e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. The di&s;tinction, which is as nothing with regard to right, is of mo&s;t weighty con&s;ideration in practice. Recover your old ground, and your old tranquillity&mdash;try it&mdash;I am per&s;uaded the Americans will compromi&s;e with you. When confidence is once re&s;tored, the odious and &s;u&s;picious <HI>&s;ummum jus,</HI> will peri&s;h of cour&s;e. The &s;pirit of practicability, of moderation, and mutual convenience, will never call in Geometrical exactne&s;s as the arbi|trator of an amicable &s;ettlement. Con&s;ult and follow your experience. Let not the long &s;tory with which I have exerci&s;ed your patience, prove fruitle&s;s to your intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>For my part, I &s;hould choo&s;e (if I could have my wi&s;h) that the propo&s;ition of the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Fuller.</NOTE>Honourable Gentleman for the repeal, could go to America without the attendance of the penal bills. Alone I could almo&s;t an&s;wer for its &s;ucce&s;s. I cannot be certain of its reception in the bad company it may keep. In &s;uch heterogeneous a&s;&s;ortments, the mo&s;t innocent per&s;on will lo&s;e the effect of his innocency.
<PB N="52" REF="55">
Though you &s;hould &s;end out this angel of peace, yet you are &s;end|ing out a de&s;troying angel too; and what would be the effect of the confli&s;t of the&s;e two adver&s;e &s;pirits, or which would predomi|nate in the end, is what I dare not &s;ay: whether the lenient mea&s;ures would cau&s;e American pa&s;&s;ion to &s;ub&s;ide, or the &s;evere would increa&s;e its fury&mdash;All this is in the hand of Providence; yet now, even now, I &s;hould confide in the prevailing virtue, and efficacious operation of lenity, though working in darkne&s;s, and in chaos, in the mid&s;t of all this unnatural and turbid combination. I &s;hould hope it might produce order and beauty in the end.</P>
<P>Let us, Sir, embrace &s;ome &s;y&s;tem or other before we end this &s;e&s;&s;ion. Do you mean to tax America, and to draw a productive revenue from thence? If you do, &s;peak out: name, fix, a&s;certain this revenue; &s;ettle its quantity; define its objects; provide for its collection; and then fight when you have &s;omething to fight for. If you murder&mdash;rob! If you kill, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and do not appear in the character of madmen, as well as a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, violent, vindictive, bloody, and tyrannical, without an object. But may better coun&s;els guide you!</P>
<P>Again, and again, revert to your old principles&mdash;&s;eek peace and en&s;ure it&mdash;leave America, if &s;he has taxable matter in her, to tax her&s;elf. I am not here going into the di&s;tinctions of rights, nor attempting to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into the&s;e me|taphy&s;ical di&s;tinctions; I hate the very &s;ound of them. Leave the Americans as they antiently &s;tood, and the&s;e di&s;tinctions, born of our unhappy conte&s;t, will die along with it. They, and we, and their and our ance&s;tors, have been happy under that &s;y&s;tem. Let the memory of all actions, in contradiction to that good old mode, on both &s;ides, be extingui&s;hed for ever. Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it. Let this be your rea&s;on for binding their trade. Do not burthen them by taxes; you were not u&s;ed to do &s;o from the beginning. Let this be your rea&s;on for not taxing. The&s;e are the arguments of &s;tates and kingdoms. Leave the re&s;t to the &s;chools; for there only they may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with &s;afety. But if, intemperately, unwi&s;ely, fatally, you &s;ophi&s;ticate and poi&s;on the very &s;ource of government, by
<PB N="53" REF="56">
urging &s;ubtle deductions, and con&s;equences odious to tho&s;e you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of &s;upreme &s;ove|reignty, you will teach them by the&s;e means to call that &s;overeignty it&s;elf in que&s;tion. When you drive him hard, the boar will &s;urely turn upon the hunters. If that &s;overeignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? they will ca&s;t your &s;ove|reignty in your face. No body will be argued into &s;lavery. Sir, let the gentlemen on the other &s;ide call forth all their ability; let the be&s;t of them get up, and tell me, what one character of liberty the Americans have, and what one brand of &s;lavery they are free from, if they are bound in their property and in|du&s;try, by all the re&s;traints you can imagine on commerce, and at the &s;ame time are made pack-hor&s;es of every tax you choo&s;e to im|po&s;e, without the lea&s;t &s;hare in granting them? When they bear the burthens of unlimited monopoly, will you bring them to bear the burthens of unlimited revenue too? The Engli&s;hman in America will feel that this &s;lavery&mdash;that it is <HI>legal</HI> &s;lavery, will be no compen&s;ation, either to his feelings or his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A Noble Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Carmarthen.</NOTE>, who &s;poke &s;ome time ago, is full of the fire of in|genuous youth; and when he has modeled the ideas of a lively ima|gination by further experience, he will be an ornament to his country in either hou&s;e. He has &s;aid, that the Americans are our children; and how can they revolt again&s;t their parent? He &s;ays, that if they are not free in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, England is not free; becau&s;e Manche&s;ter, and other con&s;iderable places, are not repre&s;ented. So then, becau&s;e &s;ome towns in England are not re|pre&s;ented, America is to have no repre&s;entative at all. They are "our children;" but when children a&s;k for bread, we are not to give a &s;tone. Is it becau&s;e the natural re&s;i&s;tance of things, and the various mutations of time, hinders our government, or any &s;cheme of government, from being any more than a &s;ort of approximation to the right, is it therefore that the Colonies are to recede from it infinitely? When this child of ours wi&s;hes to a&s;&s;imilate to its parent, and to reflect with a true filial re&s;emblance the beauteous counte|nance of Briti&s;h liberty; are we to turn to them the &s;hameful parts of our con&s;titution? are we to give them our weakne&s;s for
<PB N="54" REF="57">
their &s;trength; our opprobium for their glory; and the &s;lough of &s;lavery, which we are not able to work off, to &s;erve them for their freedom?</P>
<P>If this be the ca&s;e, a&s;k your&s;elves this que&s;tion, will they be content in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;lavery? If not, look to the con&s;e|quences. Reflect how you are to govern a people, who think they ought to be free, and think they are not. Your &s;cheme yields no revenue; it yields nothing but di&s;content, di&s;order, di&s;obe|dience; and &s;uch is the &s;tate of America, that after wading up to your eyes in blood you could only end ju&s;t where you begun; that is, to tax where no revenue is to be found, to&mdash;my voice fails me; my inclination indeed carries me no further&mdash;all is con|fu&s;ion beyond it.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, I have recovered a little, and before I &s;it down I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething to another point with which gentlemen urge us. What is to become of the declaratory act a&s;&s;erting the en|tirene&s;s of Briti&s;h legi&s;lative authority, if we abandon the practice of taxation?</P>
<P>For my part I look upon the rights &s;tated in that act, exactly in the manner in which I viewed them on its very fir&s;t propo&s;ition, and which I have often taken the liberty, with great humility, to lay before you. I look, I &s;ay, on the imperial rights of Great Britain, and the pri|vileges which the Coloni&s;ts ought to enjoy under the&s;e rights, to be ju&s;t the mo&s;t reconcileable things in the world. The Parliament of Great Britain &s;its at the head of her exten&s;ive empire in two ca|pacities: one as the local legi&s;lature of this i&s;land, providing for all things at home, immediately, and by no other in&s;trument than the executive power.&mdash;The other, and I think her nobler capacity is what I call her <HI>imperial character</HI>; in which, as from the throne of heaven &s;he &s;uperintends all the &s;everal inferior legi&s;latures, and guides, and controls them all without annihilating any. As all the&s;e provincial legi&s;latures are only co-ordinate to each other, they ought all to be &s;ubordinate to her, el&s;e they can neither pre&s;erve mutual peace, nor hope for mutual ju&s;tice, nor effectually afford mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is nece&s;&s;ary to coerce the negligent, to re|&s;train
<PB N="55" REF="58">
the violent, and to aid the weak and deficient, by the over|ruling plenitude of her power. She is never to intrude into the place of the others, whil&s;t they are equal to the common ends of their in&s;titution. But in order to enable parliament to an&s;wer all the&s;e ends of provident and beneficent &s;uperintendance, her powers mu&s;t be boundle&s;s. The gentlemen who think the powers of par|liament limited, may plea&s;e them&s;elves to talk of requi&s;itions. But &s;uppo&s;e the requi&s;itions are not obeyed? What! Shall there be no re&s;erved power in the empire, to &s;upply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and di&s;&s;ipate the whole? We are engaged in war&mdash;the Secre|tary of State calls upon the Colonies to contribute&mdash;&s;ome would do it, I think mo&s;t would chearfully furni&s;h whatever is demanded&mdash;one or two, &s;uppo&s;e, hang back, and ea&s;ing them&s;elves, let the &s;tre&s;s of the draft lie on the others&mdash;&s;urely it is proper, that &s;ome authority might legally &s;ay&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tax your&s;elves for the common &s;upply, or parliament will do it for you."</Q> This backwardne&s;s was, as I am told, actually the ca&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania for &s;ome &s;hort time towards the beginning of the la&s;t war, owing to &s;ome internal di&s;&s;entions in the Colony. But, whether the fact were &s;o, or otherwi&s;e, the ca&s;e is equally to be provided for by a competent &s;overeign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power; nor ever u&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. This is what I meant, when I have &s;aid at various times, that I con&s;ider the power of taxing in parliament as an in&s;trument of empire, and not as a means of &s;upply.</P>
<P>Such, Sir, is my idea of the con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h Empire, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the con&s;titution of Britain; and on the&s;e grounds I think &s;ubordination and liberty may be &s;ufficiently recon|ciled through the whole; whether to &s;erve a refining &s;peculati&s;t, or a factious demagogue, I know not; but enough &s;urely for the ca&s;e and happine&s;s of man.</P>
<P>Sir, whil&s;t we held this happy cour&s;e, we drew more from the Colonies than all the impotent violence of de&s;poti&s;m ever could ex|tors from them. We did this abundantly in the la&s;t war. It has never been once denied&mdash;and what rea&s;on have we to imagine that the Colonies would not have proceeded in &s;upplying government as liberally, if you had not &s;tepped in and hindered them from contri|buting,
<PB N="56" REF="59">
by interrupting the channel in which their liberality flowed with &s;o &s;trong a cour&s;e; by attempting to take, in&s;tead of being &s;a|tisfied to receive. Sir William Temple &s;ays, that Holland has loaded it&s;elf with ten times the impo&s;itions which it revolted from Spain, rather than &s;ubmit to. He &s;ays true. Tyranny is a poor provider. It knows neither how to accumulate, nor how to extract.</P>
<P>I charge therefore to this new and unfortunate &s;y&s;tem the lo&s;s not only of peace, of union, and of commerce, but even of revenue, which its friends are contending for.&mdash;It is morally certain, that we have lo&s;t at lea&s;t a million of free grants &s;ince the peace. I think we have lo&s;t a great deal more; and that tho&s;e who look for a re|venue from the Provinces, never could have pur&s;ued, even in that light, a cour&s;e more directly repugnant to their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, I tru&s;t I have &s;hewn, fir&s;t on that narrow ground which the Hon. Gentleman mea&s;ured, that you are like to lo&s;e no|thing by complying with the motion, except what you have lo&s;t already. I have &s;hewn afterwards, that in time of peace you flou|ri&s;hed in commerce, and when war required it, had &s;ufficient aid from the Colonies, while you pur&s;ued your antient policy; that you threw every thing into confu&s;ion when you made the &s;tamp act; and that you re&s;tored every thing to peace and order when you repealed it. I have &s;hewn that the revival of the &s;y&s;tem of taxation has produced the very wor&s;t effects; and that the partial repeal has produced, not partial good, but univer&s;al evil. Let the&s;e con&s;ider|ations, founded on facts, not one of which can be denied, bring us back to your rea&s;on by the road of your experience.</P>
<P>I cannot, as I have &s;aid, an&s;wer for mixed mea&s;ures; but &s;urely this mixture of lenity would give the whole a better chance of &s;uc|ce&s;s. When you once regain confidence, the way will be clear be|fore you. Then you may enforce the act of navigation when it ought to be enforced. You will your&s;elves open it where it ought &s;till further to be opened. Proceed in what you do, whatever you do, from policy, and not from rancour. Let us act like men, let us act like &s;tate&s;men. Let us hold &s;ome &s;ort of con&s;i&s;tent conduct
<PB N="57" REF="60">
&mdash;It is agreed that a revenue is not to be had in America. If we lo&s;e the profit, let us get rid of the odium.</P>
<P>On this bu&s;ine&s;s of America I confe&s;s I am &s;erious, even to &s;adne&s;s. I have had but one opinion concerning it &s;ince I &s;at, and before I &s;at, in Parliament. The noble Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> will, as u&s;ual, probably, attribute the part taken by me and my friends in this bu&s;ine&s;s, to a de&s;ire of getting his places. Let him enjoy this happy and original idea. If I deprived him of it, I &s;hould take away mo&s;t of his wit, and all his argument. But I had rather bear the brunt of all his wit, and indeed blows much heavier, than &s;tand an&s;werable to God for embracing a &s;y&s;tem that tends to the de&s;truction of &s;ome of the very be&s;t and faire&s;t of his works. But I know the map of England, as well as the noble Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE>, or as any other per&s;on; and I know that the way I take is not the road to preferment. My ex|cellent and honourable friend under me on the floor<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dowde&s;well.</NOTE>, has trod that road with great toil for upwards of twenty years toge|ther. He is not yet arrived at the noble Lord's de&s;tination. However, the tracks of my worthy friend are tho&s;e I have ever wi&s;hed to follow; becau&s;e I know they lead to honour. Long may we tread the &s;ame road together; whoever may accompany us, or whoever may laugh at us on our journey! I hone&s;tly and &s;olemnly declare, I have in all &s;ea&s;ons adhered to the &s;y&s;tem of 1766, for no other rea&s;on, than that I think it laid deep in your true&s;t intere&s;ts&mdash;and that, by limiting the exerci&s;e, it fixes on the firme&s;t foundations, a real, con&s;i&s;tent, well-grounded authority in parliament. Until you come back to that &s;y&s;tem, there will be no peace for England.</P>
