<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of this Addre&s;s is &s;o per|fectly &s;en&s;ible of how little con&s;e|quence &s;uch writings are to the public, that &s;he would mo&s;t willingly have declined troubling them on this occa&s;ion, were &s;he not impelled to it by two very &s;trong motives; a de&s;ire of vindicating her&s;elf from &s;ome of the charges brought again&s;t the following co|medy, from the interpolations thrown into one of the principal parts, on the night of per|formance; and the earne&s;t wi&s;h of expre&s;&s;ing the &s;incere gratitude &s;he is &s;en&s;ible of to the public in general, and to her friends in parti|cular, for the generous patronage they have &s;hewn towards the publication of this little piece, which with true humility and diffi|dence &s;he now &s;ubmits to their candor and indulgence.</P>
<P>The author certainly had no rea&s;on to have apprehended the unlucky event of this comedy, after the very favourable opinion which Mr. Colman, who is undoubtedly a competent judge of dramatic compo&s;itions, had expre&s;&s;ed of it,
<PB REF="3">
all along, from the time he received it, in July 1770, when he pronounced it
<Q>to bid fairer, both for &s;ame and profit, than any of her theatrical writings,</Q>
to the day of its repre|&s;entation, in March la&s;t, on the morning of which he offered
<Q>to underwrite its &s;ucce&s;s, for half a crown.</Q></P>
<P>However, &s;he confe&s;&s;es that, for &s;ome time before the exhibition, &s;he had &s;ufficient cau&s;e to be alarmed, on account of Mr. Shuter, who had a long and principal part in the comedy, &s;eldom attending the rehear&s;als; and when he did, being found to be extremely imperfect&mdash; The author remon&s;trated upon this occa&s;ion, and the manager indeed lamented the difficulty along with her, but redre&s;&s;ed it not.</P>
<P>At length though late, a day was appointed for the repre&s;entation, and on that morning Mr. Shuter appeared at rehear&s;al, pretty much in the &s;ame &s;tate as before, and confe&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf incapable of performing his part, that night. Upon which the play was obliged to be further po&s;tponed, and hand-bills were &s;ent about at noon, to adverti&s;e the town of the di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>This was a mo&s;t unlucky circum&s;tance for the author. The curio&s;ity of the public palls upon &s;uch delays, and many of her friends, who had waited in London to attend the per|formance, went into the country, concluding, from the uncertainty of the performer, joined
<PB REF="4">
to the latene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on, that the comedy could not be exhibited, this year.</P>
<P>A further and final day was afterwards de|termined on, but the audience being out of humour at their former di&s;appointment, called Mr. Shuter to account for it, on his fir&s;t ap|pearance; which threw him into &s;uch a con|fu&s;ion, that he was not able to get the better of it, throughout the whole performance.</P>
<P>This untoward incident occa&s;ioned two very con&s;iderable di&s;advantages to the piece. In the hurry of his &s;pirits the actor not only forgot his part, the deficiency of which he endea|voured to &s;upply with his own dialect, but al&s;o &s;eemed to lo&s;e all idea of the character he was to perform; and made the Governor ap|pear in a light which the author never intend|ed; that of a mean, ridiculous buffoon. This unlucky failure in the performer, was, by &s;ome, unfortunately imputed to the writer, and appeared to be a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for condemn|ing the piece.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e almo&s;t in&s;uper|able di&s;advantages, the play was &s;uffered to proceed, without any &s;ort of reprehen&s;ion, ex|cept in the in&s;tance above-mentioned, and the Epilogue concluding with the&s;e lines,
<Q><L>The author for your pa&s;&s;port trembling &s;tands,</L>
<L>And hopes you'll grant it <HI>under all your hands,</HI></L></Q>
received the fulle&s;t approbation from the au|dience, without one &s;ingle di&s;&s;enting voice.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">Many of her friends immediately quitted the theatre, in perfect a&s;&s;urance of the favourable event, and came to wi&s;h her joy that the co|medy had been &s;ufficiently &s;trong to &s;truggle thro' &s;uch hazardous circum&s;tances, as before recited. But the plea&s;ure &s;he received on this occa&s;ion, was extremely tran&s;ient, for &s;he was in a few minutes after informed, that when the play was going to be given out, for the next night, &s;ome ob&s;cure per&s;ons, in a corner of the gallery, objected to it, who were op|po&s;ed by a con&s;iderable majority in all parts of the hou&s;e; but that after this kind of alter|cation had been continued, for &s;ome minutes, the council behind the curtain, taking alarm at an apple being flung from the upper gallery, and &s;triking a branch of one of the chandeliers, thought proper to obey the malicious, who are ever the mo&s;t active, rather than the friendly, part of the audience, and withdrew the play.</P>
<P>Whether this oppo&s;ition aro&s;e from ill-na|ture, or ill-temper, cannot be now determin|ed; tho' the latter cau&s;e is full &s;ufficient to ac|count for the effect, as every one knows how dangerous a thing it mu&s;t always be, to &s;uffer an audience to be out of humour, at a fir&s;t repre&s;entation of any dramatic performance; and on this account it would certainly have been prudent to have brought Mr. Shuter be|fore them, in &s;ome of his more perfect cha|racters, between the night of the fir&s;t and <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> di&s;appointment, in order to have palliated
<PB REF="6">
the re&s;entment of the public, &s;o as to have prevented any interruption to the performance, on that account, at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>By the advice of tho&s;e friends who were pre&s;ent, the author went, that night, to Mr. Colman's hou&s;e, to confer with him upon this unexpected ebb of fortune. He &s;eemed to be much affected with it him&s;elf, expre&s;&s;ed a friendly concern at her di&s;appointment, and promi&s;ed to con&s;ult with the re&s;t of the pro|prietors, upon what compen&s;ation or redre&s;s it might be rea&s;onable to make her, upon this occa&s;ion. But the next morning he &s;ent her a letter to acquaint her, that
<Q>all her pro|&s;pects from that quarter mu&s;t be at an end, for that &s;he was to expect nothing farther from the theatre.</Q></P>
<P>The author happened to receive this &s;evere &s;entence in the mid&s;t of a large circle of her friends, who were then with her, offering their &s;ervices, for that night, to bring on the comedy again, engaging to prove the po&s;itive part of the audience &s;uperior to the negative one, upon that trial. But this kind and well-intentioned offer &s;he declined.</P>
<P>She adhered to the &s;ame moderation, al&s;o, the next day, when the &s;ame offer was again repeated, and &s;econded by &s;everal per&s;ons, be|fore unknown to her, but who &s;eemed to con|&s;ider hers as a common cau&s;e again&s;t oppre&s;|&s;ion, and declared a full confidence of carrying
<PB REF="7">
the point again&s;t any oppo&s;ition that might be attempted.</P>
<P>The author does not deny that &s;he felt re|&s;entment, and was &s;en&s;ible of inju&s;tice, all the while; but &s;he feared the con&s;equence of a riot to the manager's property; choo&s;ing to &s;uffer an injury, rather than to do one.</P>
<P>All this temper and conduct was then calmly repre&s;ented to the manager, both by letter, and the interpo&s;ition of friends, but no notice was taken of it. The author confe&s;&s;es that &s;he then made a claim of right, to &s;ome com|pen&s;ation, upon the late occa&s;ion, but not till after it had been refu&s;ed her, as a matter of fa|vour. She founded her demand, upon the u&s;age, which is the only law of theatres, and quoted many precedents of the &s;ame kind; &s;ome of them in circum&s;tances too, far more unfavour|able to the client; but neither <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI> nor <HI>courte&s;y,</HI> it &s;eems, were to be allowed &s;ufficient pleas, in her mo&s;t &s;ingular ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The author does not mean, by any thing the &s;ituation of this affair has obliged her to &s;ay here, to charge Mr. Colman with the lea&s;t de&s;ign to her injury, by any part of his con|duct, throughout. She believes him to have been perfectly &s;incere in his profe&s;&s;ions, and ingenuous in his purpo&s;es towards her; and has &s;een him mortified and concerned to the la&s;t degree, at the delays and di&s;appointments &s;he met with, tho' he did not &s;ufficiently exert his authority to prevent, or remedy them.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">The author's friends, upon finding that &s;he would not avail her&s;elf, in the way they had fir&s;t recommended, advi&s;ed her to publi&s;h the comedy, by &s;ub&s;cription; as well to vindicate her writing from the mi&s;repre&s;entation of the night of performance, as to make her&s;elf &s;ome &s;mall amends for the con&s;iderable lo&s;s and mortification &s;he had &s;u&s;tained, from its failure.</P>
<P>This kind propo&s;al &s;he has mo&s;t gratefully accepted of; and after repeating here her ac|knowledgments to the public, and her friends, for the liberal encouragement they have &s;hewn her, upon this, and every occa&s;ion, &s;he takes this opportunity al&s;o of returning her thanks to the other performers in her comedy, who took the pains to be perfect in their &s;everal parts, and &s;o well endeavoured to &s;upport the &s;pirit of their re&s;pective characters, amid&s;t the hurry and confu&s;ion which &s;o unhappily in|terrupted the cour&s;e of the performance.</P>
<P>She now begs leave to make an apology for having pre&s;umed to claim &s;o much of the public attention, on a &s;ubject relative merely to her|&s;elf; and with the &s;incere&s;t gratitude has the honour to &s;ub&s;cribe her&s;elf their much obliged, and mo&s;t obedient &s;ervant,</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<HEAD>WRITTEN BY MR. COLMAN, And &s;poken by Mrs. BULKLEY.</HEAD>
<L>BY your leave, critics! To a female play</L>
<L>A female prologue may prepare the way.</L>
<L>Among the Chronicles of modern fame</L>
<L>Who has not read of gentle Frances' name?</L>
<L>Henry and Frances! a fond tender pair,</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;oft epi&s;tles &s;till amu&s;e the fair.</L>
<L>Some nights ago our couple, all alone,</L>
<L>A fire-&s;ide <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</HI>&mdash;Darby and Joan&mdash;</L>
<L>Frances, &s;aid Henry, give up writing; men,</L>
<L>And men alone &s;hould dare to wield the pen.</L>
<L>Your &s;ex of late all decency confounds,</L>
<L>And breaks 'twixt us and them the mode&s;t bounds.</L>
<L>Whether from pa&s;&s;ion, love of pow'r or riches,</L>
<L>Women, we &s;ee, all like to wear the breeches.</L>
<L>At &s;ea &s;ome madcaps enter volunteers,</L>
<L>Some in the army li&s;t as grenadiers:</L>
<L>Others write hi&s;t'ries, &s;tate-intrigues unriddle,</L>
<L>Ride the great hor&s;e, and play upon the fiddle.</L>
<L>Gently, cries Frances; truce with your reproaches!</L>
<L>And mark which &s;ex on t'other mo&s;t encroaches.</L>
<L>Soft &s;ilky coxcombs, full of nice punctilio,</L>
<L>All pa&s;te, pomatum, e&s;&s;ence, and pulvilio,</L>
<L>With huge boaupots, like boughpots, daily go,</L>
<L>Trick'd out like dolls, to pace in Rotten-row.</L>
<L>Thus flies the morning; and the day to crown,</L>
<L>To quinze and faro ev'ry fop &s;its down.</L>
<L><PB REF="19">Each coat &s;o trim, le&s;t any &s;peck fall on it,</L>
<L>An apron guards,&mdash;each forehead a &s;traw-bonnet;</L>
<L>Nay le&s;t rouleaus them&s;elves &s;hould &s;oil their ruffles,</L>
<L>A muffatee each pretty ma&s;ter muffles.</L>
<L>Women in vain to keep their place have &s;triven;</L>
<L>From ev'ry trade, from each profe&s;&s;ion driven.</L>
<L>Men-midwives &s;warm; men mantuas make, make &s;tays,</L>
<L>Dre&s;s hair, dre&s;s meat&mdash;let women then write plays!</L>
<L>While narrow prejudice deform'd the age,</L>
<L>No actre&s;s play'd, no female trod the &s;tage;</L>
<L>Some &s;mooth unrazor'd youth for Juliet rav'd,</L>
<L>And Kings &s;at waiting till the Queen was &s;hav'd;</L>
<L>But woman once brought forward on the &s;cene,</L>
<L>By man, like Eve, was lik'd as &s;oon as &s;een.</L>
<L>Let females then compo&s;e, as well as play,</L>
<L>And &s;trive to plea&s;e you in the noble&s;t way!</L>
<L>No &s;ulky critic to the play-hou&s;e drawn,</L>
<L>Whom modern comedy provokes to yawn,</L>
<L>But marks of authors pa&s;t the valu'd file,</L>
<L>And owns Centlivre tempted him to &s;mile.</L>
<L>Why may not Ladies too in future plays,</L>
<L>Strike <HI>a Bold Stroke,</HI> and, anxious for the bays,</L>
<L>New <HI>Bu&s;y Bodies</HI> form, new <HI>Wonders</HI> rai&s;e?</L>
<L>Thus Frances &s;poke, and bid her dear good night&mdash;</L>

<P>She had no need to blu&s;h, then, if &s;he was innocent; and I warrant your Lady&s;hip that her face was as red as your Morro &s;atin, all the while my Lord was talking to her; though it is naturally pure and pale, you know, at any other time.

<P>Why really, Ma'am, it would have been a very indi&s;creet thing in me, and contrary to my own intere&s;t, as well as your Lady&s;hip's, to have made mi&s;chief between my Lord and you, be|fore you were married. It might have broken off the match, perhaps, and then every &s;ervant in the hou&s;e would have been a lo&s;er, as well as I, Ma'am. But when once the wedding &s;hould be over, and all &s;ecured, I re&s;olved to watch her clo&s;ely, and if I &s;aw any thing wrong, to acquaint your Lady&s;hip with it then, when it could do no harm. But they have been too cunning for us, this trip. For to be &s;ure and certain, &s;he is now with my Lord, at his hou&s;e in the country.</P>

<P>Softly, &s;oftly, good Mr. Squeezem; you have run your&s;elf out of breath, and taken mine away too, with that la&s;t article. What! five hun|dred

more than Sir William may be willing to give! Why, he may bid three thou&s;and, for aught I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not unlikely, Sir, though as yet he has offered but two. But Sir William is a man of &s;pirit: and honour, honour, Sir, cannot be bought too dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, Sir, that honours that are bought, are not very honourable.</P>

<P>They are doubtle&s;s of more value, when derived from per&s;onal worth&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is exactly the ca&s;e in point, Mr. Nicholas; for if his Excellency was not <HI>worth</HI> the afore&s;aid &s;um of three thou&s;and five hundred pounds, he would not have the honour conferred upon him of repre&s;enting the antient and loyal corporation of Bartertown&mdash;Ergol, it is his worth, or what he is worth, which is the &s;ame thing, that obtains him that honour.</P>

<P>I deny your major, and will prove your po&s;tulatum fal&s;e&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>So much the better. Now to the purpo&s;e, Mr. Squeezem. Suppo&s;e then that this &s;ame gentle|man&mdash;Sir William Wealthy, I think you call him&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that, Sir, is his real name and title. His father was Sir John Wealthy, his grandfather Sir Robert, and his great grandfather, who was the fir&s;t Baronet of the family&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what the plague, man, have I to do with his father or grandfather.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, if you are in a pa&s;&s;ion about the matter, there is no harm done. I don't want
<PB N="20" REF="40">
to per&s;uade you to be a member of parliament, again&s;t your inclination; though I mu&s;t needs own that I know no per&s;on who would make a bet|ter figure in the hou&s;e than your Excellency. Such a pre&s;ence, &s;uch a &s;weet toned voice. I think I hear the people a&s;k, who is that honourable gentle|man who &s;poke la&s;t? Governor Ander&s;on, &s;ays one. O he's a charming man, and a true patriot, &s;ays another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, ay, Mr. Squeezem, if I do come into the hou&s;e, I &s;hall be a true patriot, you may rely on it&mdash;I'll get their &s;treets paved, and their lamps lighted for them, I warrant me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o I have already told them, Sir. Governor Ander&s;on, &s;ays I, is as rich as forty Jews, and no more values money than dirt; he'd &s;corn to do a mean thing, for filthy lucre, but will let his ca&s;h fly among&s;t ye, like du&s;t, my boys. For you know, Sir&punc; they always think him the be&s;t patriot that &s;pends mo&s;t money; and let little Squeezem alone for di&s;po&s;ing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the very thing I would be at, the laying out my money to the be&s;t advantage, and therefore, d'ye hear, I would be glad to know, &s;uppo&s;ing the wor&s;t &s;hould happen, and that Sir William &s;hould out-bid me, how much I may be likely to lo&s;e by the di&s;appointment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a calculation intirely out of my way, Sir.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, &s;tocks are &s;o confounded low, at pre&s;ent, that I can't bear the thoughts of &s;elling
<PB N="21" REF="41">
out, to a di&s;advantage. But you may pa&s;s your word to them, Mr. Squeezem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squeez.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pa&s;s my word, Governor! Such coin will not pa&s;s current, in that quarter, I a&s;&s;ure you. Sterling ca&s;h, and nothing el&s;e will do. But if it is &s;o very inconvenient to you to rai&s;e the money, there are gentlemen enough ready to leap at the offer. There has not been &s;o cheap a borough to be &s;old, the&s;e &s;even years, nor won't be, during this &s;e&s;&s;ion, I'll warrant you. Why, Sir, every man of property in the kingdom wants to get into parlia|ment, now; and you gentlemen Nabobs have rai&s;ed the price of boroughs, as well as of every other commodity, throughout the nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, &s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, we'll &s;ee what's to be done. I &s;hall meet Bull, pre&s;ently, and he &s;hall carry you a thou&s;and. That will be two, and I won't go a &s;hilling farther, remember, Mr. Squeezem.</P>

<P>No, really, Madam, the contents of this letter have nothing either &s;weet or &s;oft, in them.&mdash; 'Tis from my aunt, Lady Walton, who declines receiving me under her protection, from a ridi|culous apprehen&s;ion that her &s;on, Sir William, now ju&s;t coming of age, might po&s;&s;ibly take it into his head to fall in love with his cou&s;en.</P>

<P>I have &s;aid too much of their re&s;pective &s;ituations ever to reveal their names.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Frank.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your conduct, I grant it, was he|roic, Charlotte, and might have made a notable figure in a romance, &s;ome centuries ago; but epic virtue, my dear, is by no means the <HI>ton</HI> of modern times. The pre&s;ent world is not near &s;o difficult as
<PB N="27" REF="47">
it was formerly; and the utmo&s;t that is required of feeble nature, now-a-days, is barely to conceal the vices we have, under the affectation of tho&s;e virtues we are deficient in.</P>

<P>Nay, prithee, Mi&s;s Melville, do not preach again&s;t prudence.

What can this particular in|vitation mean? There &s;eems to be &s;omething odd in this bu&s;ine&s;s, Colonel. Perhaps her Lady&s;hip de&s;igns to rai&s;e my jealou&s;y. I have heard of &s;uch arts put in practice upon lukewarm hu&s;bands, here|tofore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has gone one &s;tep towards it, my Lord, at lea&s;t, by rai&s;ing your curio&s;ity. But where our affections are not much intere&s;ted, I &s;hould think it unnatural for any &s;uch pa&s;&s;ion to be moved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll pardon me, Colonel, for though I am not romantically in love with my wife, I could perhaps be as outrageou&s;ly jealous of her honour, on the lea&s;t alarm, as the mo&s;t amorous coxcomb breathing. But to do her ju&s;tice, her conduct through life has been &s;o irreproachable, that I dare &s;ay her &s;en&s;e and virtue will never &s;uffer her to render me unea&s;y; that way, at lea&s;t.</P>

<P>I &s;hould be better plea&s;ed at hearing you make your wife's encomium, if it did not &s;o &s;trongly
<PB N="40" REF="60">
reflect upon your&s;elf, my Lord. How is it po&s;&s;ible that you can allow her tho&s;e merits which are to be the ba&s;is of your &s;ecurity and peace, and yet withhold from her the ju&s;t reward of them, your tenderne&s;s and e&s;teem?</P>
</SP>

<P>Do not pre&s;s me upon this &s;ubject, Ram&s;ay, for even to you I cannot unfold the &s;ecret of my heart; but will &s;o far confe&s;s to you that I have acted, and &s;till continue to do &s;o, again&s;t the fulle&s;t conviction both of my honour and rea&s;on. But perhaps if I could happen to di&s;cover a few failings in my wife's character, her pre&s;ence would be le&s;s unea&s;y to me; for, in &s;hort, Charles, we cannot love any one cordially, who con&s;tantly re|proaches us, though ever &s;o &s;ilently.</P>

After &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;truggles with my&s;elf, I at length determined to confe&s;s my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Melville, and break off the treaty with you&mdash; I wrote to her, accordingly, on the &s;ubject&mdash;Her an&s;wer was con&s;i&s;tent with that worth which dig|nifies her whole conduct.

<P>I have rea&s;on to believe that &s;he left this hou&s;e, in hopes her ab&s;ence might efface my pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;uffer your beauty and merits, Madam, to produce the effect they mu&s;t naturally have had upon a di&s;engaged heart. From that moment, till this evening, and that by accident merely, I declare I never &s;aw or heard from her; and was, at that in&s;tant, only intreating her return to you again. If therefore you have conceived one doubt to her di&s;honour, bani&s;h it for ever from your mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never had a doubt, my Lord, of Charlotte's worth, nor was it jealou&s;y, but friend|&s;hip, that brought me to be a witne&s;s of that &s;cene which fir&s;t di&s;turbed my confidence in her&mdash;But you have now re&s;tored it, and if I knew where to direct my cour&s;e, I would this moment fly to intreat her pardon, as I do yours; for I have injured you beyond the hope of an atonement&mdash;'Twas &s;elfi&s;h vanity in&s;pired the cruel wi&s;h of being yours, with|out the power of paying back the happine&s;s I re|ceived.</P>

<P>Nay, Madam, do not &s;peak &s;o hum|bly&mdash;The polite attentions which I paid you, joined to your own per&s;onal charms and merits, might,

without vanity, have made you think that you po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed my love; whil&s;t I, fal&s;e to your happine&s;s, as well as to my own, knew but too well I had not then a heart to give.</P>

<P>My dear, my injured Charlotte, I have not words to atone the wrong I have done you, but hope in Colonel Ram&s;ay to obtain an ad|vocate more powerful than my&s;elf, for your for|givene&s;s.</P>

<P>My dear Lady Seaton, this is too good, too conde&s;cending, and too kind! I meant to have gone to you.</P>

<P>No, my friend, nothing can be too much from one who has injured innocence and worth like yours by doubting of your virtue, for a moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot comprehend this mi&s;tery&mdash;it is impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould wrong me. Some &s;pell has &s;urely been ca&s;t round me, for Ram&s;ay too has doubted of my truth and love.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Sea.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, only I, who formed the charm, can break it. (My weak unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions have betrayed you into error; your cen&s;ure and re&s;ent|ment therefore &s;hould light on me alone.

<P>I am perplexed&mdash;What can all this mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>It means, my Charlotte, that my too ha&s;ty credulity has hurried me into a fault; which I can never hope you &s;hould forgive, the &s;u&s;pecting truth and virtue &s;uch as yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>To doubt of pardon, on repentance, ag|gravates the crime; for who that pretends not to perfection in them&s;elves, &s;hall dare to be impla|cable to another's &s;ailings. But &s;till I am in the dark and on the rack, to know how all this &s;trange confu&s;ion has been conjured up.</P>

<P>It aro&s;e intirely from my indi&s;cretion in letting drop to Markam my having met you at Mrs. Frankly's. She happened to &s;ee the Colonel immediately after, and informed him of all, and perhaps more than &s;he knew.</P>

<P>Why, my Lord, I have both que&s;tions and commands to propo&s;e to you, d'ye &s;ee, tho' I think you have been more inclined to a game of cro&s;s-purpo&s;es, than any thing el&s;e, lately.
