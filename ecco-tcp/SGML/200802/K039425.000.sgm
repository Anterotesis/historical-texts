<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your GRACE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Mu&s;es were ever ambitious of being di&s;tingui&s;h'd, by &s;hrouding them&s;elves under the Patronage of the greate&s;t Men in all Ages; not made &s;o by Titles or Preferment; but &s;uch, who&s;e in|nate Principles of Honour, truly &s;uppor|ted tho&s;e their Prince had crown'd them with. From hence &s;prung my Pre&s;ump|tion of laying the following Scenes at Your Grace's Feet; &s;ince the World mu&s;t allow, that all tho&s;e Virtues, which compleat a perfect good, as well as great Man, are
<PB REF="3">
center'd in the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>; the loyale&s;t Subject, the tendere&s;t Hu&s;band, and the kinde&s;t Ma&s;ter, that ever Monarch, Wife, or Servant had; Briliant Graces, but &s;uch as do not &s;hine in every Man of Quali|ty. From &s;uch Patriots, what may not <HI>Britain</HI> hope? Nay, what might not She command, were all her Sons as fervent for her Inte|re&s;t, and di&s;charg'd their re&s;pective Tru&s;ts with that Fidelity, and due Regard to the publick Good, as Your Grace has ever done in Yours: Then the hated Name of Faction wou'd be heard no more, and the &s;candalous Wounds of hot-headed Parties heal'd; which is the only way to &s;ecure this I&s;land from foreign In&s;ults, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h Peace more firmly, than Armies, tho' va&s;t as <HI>Xerxes</HI> led, can do.</P>
<P>To attempt your Grace's Character, is the &s;uperiour bu&s;ine&s;s of a Ma&s;culine Pen, and not to be reach'd by mine: But &s;ince my Hu&s;band has the Honour to &s;erve Her Maje&s;ty, under the Command of Your Grace, as he did the late King of glorious Memory, under that of your noble Father, I cou'd not be prevail'd upon to alter my

Re&s;olution of prefixing your Grace's Name in the front of this Poem, at once to &s;hew my Gratitude, and my Ambition: And if, when Your Grace's Mind's unbended from the Care and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the State, it finds the way in &s;ome lei&s;ure Hour to divert Your Grace, and the Author meet your Pardon for this Liberty, my Wi&s;hes are all an&s;wer'd; as I hope my Prayers will be, that Your Grace may enjoy a perfect Health, free from Pain in Mind, and Body; and &s;ee as many flouri&s;hing happy New Years, as your be&s;t and deare&s;t Friends can de&s;ire; and every one add fre&s;h Honours to tho&s;e that are &s;o de&s;ervedly worn by Your Grace at pre&s;ent, which are the earne&s;t Wi&s;hes of</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I Shou'd not have troubled my Courteous Reader with a Preface, had I not lain under the Nece&s;&s;ity of Clear|ing my &s;elf of what &s;ome People have been pleas'd to charge me with, <HI>viz.</HI> of being the Author of a Paper call'd, <HI>The Female Tattler,</HI> con&s;equently of a Paragraph in that of the <HI>14</HI>th In&s;tant, relating to this Comedy; tho' I think no rea&s;onable Per&s;on will believe I could be guilty of &s;o much Folly. Tho' Vanity is &s;aid to be the darling Vice of Woman|kind, yet nothing but an Idiot wou'd expre&s;s them&s;elves &s;o openly; and I hope the World won't think me guilty of Printing, what I mu&s;t blu&s;h to Read, nor imagine it Wrote even by any Friend of mine, for two Rea&s;ons; Fir&s;t, the Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Flattery. Secondly, the In|jury it mu&s;t of cour&s;e do me, in the Run of my Play, by putting tho&s;e People out of Humour, who&s;e Action was to give Life to the Piece. I &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Rea&s;ons are &s;uf|ficient to convince the Judicious part, that I was no ways concerned in tho&s;e Reflections, but own I was treated with all the &s;eeming Civility in the World, till the &s;econd Night of my Comedy. I willingly &s;ubmitted to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Supe|riour Judgment in &s;hortning the Scene of the Gho&s;t in the la&s;t Act, and believed him perfectly in the Right, becau&s;e too
<PB REF="6">
much Repetition is tire&s;ome. Indeed when Mr. <HI>E&s;tcourt</HI> &s;lic'd mo&s;t of it out, I cou'd not help interpo&s;ing my De&s;ires to the contrary, which the re&s;t readily comply'd with; and I had the Satisfaction to &s;ee I was not deceiv'd in my Opinion, of its plea&s;ing. This Pa&s;&s;age I happen'd to mention among my Acquaintance; for 'tis Natural to have a kind of a Tender for our own Productions, but e&s;pecially if they have the good Fortune to divert others. Now, if from this the Author of the <HI>Tattler</HI> gather'd his Account, I am guilty of &s;peaking, but not de&s;ignedly; for who they are that Write that Paper, or how Di|&s;tingui&s;h'd, I am perfectly ignorant, and declare I never was concern'd, either in Writing, or Publi&s;hing, any of the <HI>Tattlers.</HI></P>
<P>I never had the Vanity to think, much le&s;s to publi&s;h, that any thing I am capable of doing, cou'd &s;upport the Stage, tho' I have had the good Fortune to plea&s;e, or to find the Town willing to be pleas'd; tho' at pre&s;ent it &s;eems a certain Author has enter'd a Caveat again&s;t all Plays running to a &s;ixth Night, but his own. Tho' an Opera interfer'd with this Comedy, yet it brought above Forty Pounds the &s;econd Night, which &s;hew'd it had &s;ome Merit; for I have known many a Play kept up, that fail'd of half that Money the &s;econd Night. Now by the Rules of the Hou&s;e, it ought to have been play'd on: But who can &s;ecure the Life of a Play, when that of a Man is often Sacrific'd to the Malice of Parties? This Play met with a kind Reception in gene|ral, and notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;advantages it had to &s;truggle with, by rai&s;ing the Prices the fir&s;t Day, and the Nearne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> it would have made its way to a &s;ixth Night, if it had had fair Play. Mi|&s;take
<PB REF="7">
me not, I do not mean from the Repre&s;entation; for I mu&s;t do the Players Rea&s;on: Had I &s;earch'd all the Theatres in the World, I cou'd not have &s;elected a better Company, nor had more Ju&s;tice done me in the Action, tho' they have not dealt honourably by me in my Bargain; for they ought not to have &s;top'd the Run, upon any Pique whatever. 'Tis &s;mall Encouragment to Write for the Stage, when the Actors, according to the Caprice of their Humours, mangre the Ta&s;te of the Town, have power to &s;ink the Reputation of a Play; for if they re&s;olve not to Act it, the Town can't &s;upport it.</P>
<P>Well, if there is any Merit in &s;uffering wrongfully, I &s;hall find my Account in't one time or other; in the mean while I intreat the <HI>Female Tattler</HI> to be Witty no more at my Expence. I de&s;ire I may not be rank'd in the Number of tho&s;e that &s;upport the Stage, &s;ince the Stage is become a Noun Sub&s;tantive, and re&s;olves to &s;hew it is able to &s;tand by it&s;elf.</P>

<L>And la&s;h the Vice and Follies of the Age;</L>
<L>Why &s;hou'd tender <HI>Delia</HI> tax the Nation?</L>
<L>Stickle, and make a Noi&s;e for Reformation,</L>
<L>Who always gave a Loo&s;e, her &s;elf, to Inclination.</L>

<L>Cowards may huff, and talk of mighty Wonders,</L>
<L>And Jilts &s;et up&mdash;for Twenty thou&s;and Pounders.</L>
<L>Our Author, even tho' &s;he knows full well,</L>
<L>Is &s;o Good-natur'd, &s;he forbears to tell</L>
<L>What Collonels, lately, have found out the Knack</L>
