<P>THE Author of this Abridgment of Dr. Gold&s;mith's Hi&s;tory of Greece, having long lived in the greate&s;t intimacy with that ingenious Writer, and having thereby had an opportunity to know his &s;entiments on the &s;ubject of hi&s;torical compo&s;ition, and particularly on the me|thod of forming Abridgments, has endea|voured, as far as his abilities would admit, to execute the work in &s;uch a manner, as, he imagines, the Doctor him&s;elf would have done, had he lived to add this, as he certainly intended, to his many other valu|able literary productions.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF GREECE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. OF THE EARLIEST STATE OF GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of ancient Greece, like that of modern Germany, is not &s;o much the hi&s;tory of any particular kingdom, as of a number of petty independent &s;tates, &s;ometimes at war, and &s;ometimes in alliance with one another. Of the&s;e different &s;tates, therefore, we &s;hall now give an account, with as much brevity as is con&s;i&s;tent with per&s;picuity; and we &s;hall begin our narrative at that period, where real and authentic hi&s;tory com|mences: for as to the more early, that is the fabu|lous times of the Grecian republics, the&s;e belong to mythology rather than to hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Sicyon, then, is &s;aid to have been the fir&s;t king|dom that was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Greece. The begin|ning of it is placed by hi&s;torians in the year of the world one thou&s;and nine hundred and fifteen, before Chri&s;t two thou&s;and eighty-nine, and before the fir&s;t Olympiad one thou&s;and three hundred and thirteen. Its fir&s;t king was Aegialeus. It is &s;aid to have la&s;t|ed a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="12"><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2148. </NOTE>The kingdom of Argos, in Pelo|ponne&s;us, began a thou&s;and and eighty years before the fir&s;t Olympiad, in the time of Abra|ham. The fir&s;t king was Inachus.</P>
<P>This was &s;ucceeded by the kingdom of Mycenae, to which place the &s;eat of government was trans|ferred from Argos by Per&s;eus, the grand&s;on of Acri|&s;ius, the king of Argos, whom Per&s;eus unfortunate|ly flew. Eury&s;theus, the third in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from him, was expelled by the Heraclidae, or de&s;cendants of Hercules, who made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Pe|loponne&s;us.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2448. </NOTE>The kingdom of Athens was fir&s;t formed into a regular government by Cecrops, an Egyptian. This prince having quitted Egypt, and &s;pent &s;ome time in travelling through Phoenicia and other parts, came at la&s;t into Attica, where he married the daughter of Actaeus, the king of that country, and, upon his death, &s;ucceeded to the throne. He taught the people, who had hither|to led a wandering life, the u&s;e of fixed habita|tions; re&s;trained all licentious amours, by obliging every man to be content with one wife; and, for the better admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, he in&s;tituted the celebrated court of Areopagus. Amphictyon, the third king of Athens, e&s;tabli&s;hed the famous Amphictyonic Council, which makes &s;o capital a figure in the hi&s;tory of Greece. And Codrus, the la&s;t prince of this line, devoted him&s;elf for the good of his country. For in a war between the Athe|nians and the Heraclidae, in which the latter had penetrated to the very gates of Athens, Codrus hearing that the Oracle had declared, that that peo|ple &s;hould prove conquerors, who&s;e king fir&s;t fell in the conte&s;t, di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in the habit of a pea|&s;ant, and going over to the enemy's camp, pro|voked one of their common &s;oldiers, who in&s;tantly flew him. The Heraclidae, being informed of this
<PB N="3" REF="13">
circum&s;tance, concluded that heaven had declared again&s;t them; and they therefore retreated to their own country without &s;triking another blow. Af|ter the death of Codrus, the title of king was abo|li&s;hed at Athens, and that of Archon, or chief-go|vernor, &s;ub&s;tituted in its &s;tead. The duration of this la&s;t office was at fir&s;t for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or's life. It was afterwards limited to ten years, and finally to one.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2549. Cadmus was the founder of the kingdom of Thebes.</NOTE> To him are attributed &s;ixteen letters of the Greek alphabet; though it is probable he borrowed them from the Phoenician characters, rather than invented them. The adventures of his unhappy po&s;terity, Laius, Joca&s;ta, Oedipus, Eteocles, and Polynices, are well known.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Sparta, or Lacedaemon, is &s;up|po&s;ed to have been fir&s;t in&s;tituted by Lelexa. He|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ena, the tenth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from this monarch, is equally famous for her beauty and her infidelity to the marriage-bed. She had not lived above three years with her hu&s;band Menelaus, when &s;he was carried off by Paris, the &s;on of Priam king of Troy. In revenge the Greeks inve&s;ted that city, and took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t after a &s;iege of ten years, about the time that Jephtha was judge in I&s;rael.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 2820.</NOTE> Corinth began to be formed into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tate at a later period than any of the kingdoms above-mentioned.

<P><PB N="4" REF="14">The kingdom of Macedon was fir&s;t governed by Caranus, de&s;cended from Hercules, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted from his time till the defeat of Per&s;eus by the Ro|mans, a &s;pace of &s;ix hundred and twenty-&s;ix years.</P>
<P>Such was the political &s;ituation of Greece in the early period of its hi&s;tory, during which we &s;ee that kingly government prevailed in all the &s;tates; but this was &s;oon changed every where, except in Ma|cedonia, for a republican mode of government, which however was diver&s;ified into as many various forms as there were different cities, according to the peculiar character of each re&s;pective people.</P>
<P>The&s;e different &s;tates, though totally indepen|dent, and &s;ometimes at war with one another, were yet united by one common language and one reli|gion; by the celebration of public games, at which they all a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and particularly by the famous Am|phictyonic Council, which met twice a year at Ther|mopylae, in order to deliberate about the general intere&s;t of tho&s;e &s;tates of who&s;e deputies it was com|po&s;ed. The &s;tates that &s;ent deputies to this council were twelve, viz. the The&s;&s;alians, the Thebans, the Dorians, the Ionians, the Perhaebeans, the Mag|netes, the Locrians, the Oetans, the Phthiotes, the Maleans, the Phocians, and the Dolopians. Each of the&s;e &s;tates &s;ent two deputies to the council, one of whom was named Hieromnemon, and took care of religion; the other was called Pylagoras, and at|tended to the civil intere&s;ts of his community. Af|ter offering up &s;acrifices to Apollo, Diana, Latona, and Minerva, the deputies took an oath, importing, that they would never &s;ubvert any city of the Am|phictyons, never &s;top the cour&s;e of waters either in war or peace, and that they would oppo&s;e any at|tempts to le&s;&s;en the reverence and authority of the gods, to whom they had paid their adoration.</P>
<P>The&s;e different motives to confederacy united the Greeks for a time into a body of great power, and
<PB N="5" REF="15">
greater renown. By this a&s;&s;ociation a country; not half &s;o large as England, was able to di&s;pute the empire of the world with the greate&s;t monarchs of the earth. By this a&s;&s;ociation they were able not only to oppo&s;e, but even to rout and di&s;per&s;e the mo&s;t numerous armies of Per&s;ia, reducing their power to &s;o low an ebb, as to make them &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t mortifying conditions of peace. But of all the &s;tates of Greece, the two that made the mo&s;t capital figure, were Athens and Lacedaemon; and of the&s;e, therefore, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give a more particular account, than our limits will al|low us to give of the re&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SPARTA, AND THE LAWS OF LYCURGUS.</HEAD>
<P>LACEDAEMON, as we have already ob&s;erved, was in the beginning governed by kings, of which thirteen in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion held the reins of power, of the race of the Pelopidae. Under the Hera|clidae, who &s;ucceeded them, in&s;tead of one king, the people admitted two, who governed with equal authority. This change is &s;aid to have been owing to the following circum&s;tance: Ari&s;todemus dying, left two &s;ons, Euri&s;thenes and Procles, who were twins, and &s;o very much alike, that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other; and the mother, equally attached to both, and de&s;irous of advancing both to the throne, pretended that &s;he really could not tell which of them was fir&s;t born, or which had the be&s;t claim. The people, therefore, inve&s;ted both with the &s;overeign power; and this form of government, however &s;trange, con|tinued to &s;ub&s;i&s;t for &s;everal centuries.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="16">It was during this latter period, that the Helots, or pea&s;ants of Sparta, were in&s;laved; for the&s;e peo|ple having taken up arms, in order to vindicate their right to the &s;ame privileges as the citizens en|joyed, which the two fir&s;t kings had be&s;towed upon them, and of which Agis had deprived them, they were, after a violent &s;truggle, &s;ubdued; and, to puni&s;h them for their rebellion, they and their po|&s;terity were condemned to perpetual &s;lavery; and, to render their condition as di&s;graceful as it was mi&s;erable, all other &s;laves were called by the general name of Helots.</P>
<P>To prevent the repetition of the&s;e and the like di&s;orders, to which this little &s;tate was &s;ubject, Ly|curgus in&s;tituted his celebrated body of laws, which makes &s;o con&s;picuous a figure in the hi&s;tory of Greece; and which continued, for a long time, to render Lacedaemon at once the terror and the umpire of the neighbouring kingdoms. But before he gave this proof of his patrioti&s;m and his abilities as a legi&s;|lator, he gave, if po&s;&s;ible, a &s;till more &s;triking proof of his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and love of ju&s;tice. For hav|ing &s;ucceeded to the throne by the death of his elder brother, Polydectes, without i&s;&s;ue, and the queen-dowager, his &s;i&s;ter-in-law, afterwards proving with child, &s;he offered to de&s;troy the birth, provided he would marry her, and admit her into a &s;hare of power. Lycurgus di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment at &s;o unnatural a propo&s;al, and fearing that &s;he might u&s;e means to put her de&s;ign in execution, a&s;&s;ured her that, as &s;oon as the child was born, he would take care to remove it out of the way. Accordingly, &s;he was delivered of a boy, which Lycurgus com|manded to be brought to him, and pre&s;enting him to the people, as their lawful &s;overeign, by the name of Charilaus, he continued thenceforward to act, not as king, but as regent.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="17">The better to qualify him&s;elf for the office of a legi&s;lator, which he was now about to a&s;&s;ume, he travelled into Crete, and afterwards into A&s;ia, where he is &s;aid to have made the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the works of Homer. From thence he went into Egypt; and having thus made him&s;elf acquainted with the cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions of the various coun|tries through which he pa&s;&s;ed, he at length returned home; and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his de&s;igns by &s;ome of the leading men of the &s;tate, he publi&s;hed his ce|lebrated code of laws, by which it was enacted, that the kings &s;hould retain their right of &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion as before: but their authority was con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed by the in&s;titution of a Senate, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-eight members, cho&s;en from among the principal citizens, into which none were eligible till they were &s;ixty years of age. The kings, how|ever, &s;till enjoyed all their outward marks of dignity and re&s;pect. They had the chief &s;eats in every pub|lic a&s;&s;embly; they gave their votes fir&s;t; they re|ceived amba&s;&s;adors, and other &s;trangers of di&s;tinc|tion; and in time of war they had the command of the army; though upon the&s;e occa&s;ions they were &s;ubject to the controul of the Senate, who &s;ome|times obliged them to march again&s;t the enemy, or return home, when they had lea&s;t inclination to do either.</P>
<P>The Senators, too, were the more re&s;pectable, as they held their places for life; and be&s;ides, being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;hare of the executive, were inve&s;ted with the whole of the judicial power; and this la&s;t part of their duty they executed with &s;uch integrity and di&s;cretion, that though there lay an appeal from them to the people, yet their de|crees were hardly ever rever&s;ed. Their authority, however, was about a century after tempered by the erection of a &s;uperior court, called the Court of the Ephori, con&s;i&s;ting of but five members, cho&s;en
<PB N="8" REF="18">
annually into office, and elected from among the people; and the&s;e had a power to arre&s;t and im|pri&s;on even the per&s;ons of their kings, if they acted in a mannner unbecoming their &s;tation.</P>
<P>In order to reconcile the people to this mode of go|vernment, in which though they had a nominal, they had no real &s;hare, Lycurgus fell upon two expedients, equally bold and deci&s;ive. The&s;e were to divide all the lands of the &s;tate equally among the citizens, and to aboli&s;h the u&s;e of money. The lands of Laconia he divided into thirty thou&s;and parts, and tho&s;e of Sparta into nine thou&s;and; and the&s;e he portioned out to the re&s;pective inhabitants of each di&s;trict. To aboli&s;h the u&s;e of money, he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to deprive tho&s;e, who were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of gold and &s;ilver, of their property. He thought it &s;ufficient to cry down the value of tho&s;e metals, and to order that nothing but iron money &s;hould pa&s;s in exchange for any commodity. This coin al&s;o he made &s;o heavy, and fixed at &s;o low a rate, that a cart and two oxen were required to carry home a &s;um of ten minae, or about twenty pounds &s;terling. As this coin had no currency among the other &s;tates of Greece, it &s;oon fell into contempt even among the Spartans them&s;elves; who de&s;pi&s;ed it &s;o much, that money was at la&s;t brought into difu&s;e, and few troubled them&s;elves with more than was nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer their daily expences.</P>
<P>To enforce the practice of temperance and &s;o|briety, Lycurgus further ordained, that all the men &s;hould eat in one common hall in public. Every one was obliged to &s;end thither his provi&s;ions monthly, con&s;i&s;ting of one bu&s;hel of flour, eight mea&s;ures of wine, five pounds of chee&s;e, and two pounds and a half of figs; and this regulation was &s;o rigidly ob&s;erved, that a long time after, when Agis returned from a &s;ucce&s;sful expedition, he was &s;everely reprimanded for having eaten with his
<PB N="9" REF="19">
queen in private. Black broth was their favourite di&s;h; of what ingredients it was compo&s;ed is not known; but, as they u&s;ed no fle&s;h in their enter|tainments, it probably re&s;embled tho&s;e lenten &s;oups which are &s;till in u&s;e on the continent. Diony&s;ius, the tyrant, found this fare very unpalatable; but, as the cook a&s;&s;erted, the broth was nothing without the &s;ea&s;oning of fatigue and hunger.</P>
<P>To accu&s;tom the youth to early habits of di&s;ci|pline and obedience, Lycurgus took their education out of the hands of their parents, and committed it to ma&s;ters appointed by the &s;tate. So de&s;irous, indeed, was he of having a hardy and robu&s;t race of citizens, that he began the work of education, even from the time of the mother's conception, making it her duty to u&s;e &s;uch diet and exerci&s;e, as might fit her to produce a healthy and vigorous off|&s;pring. Nay, &s;uch children as were born with any capital defect, were not &s;uffered to be brought up, but were expo&s;ed to peri&s;h in a cavern near mount Taygetus; and &s;uch as, upon a public view, were deemed to be &s;ound and healthy, were adopted as children of the &s;tate, and delivered to their parents to be nur&s;ed with rigour and &s;everity. From their tendere&s;t years they were accu&s;tomed to make no choice in their eating, not to be afraid in the dark, or when left alone; not to be peevi&s;h or fretful; to walk barefoot; to lie hard at nights; to wear the &s;ame clothes &s;ummer and winter, and to fear no|thing from their equals. At the age of &s;even they were taken from their parents, and delivered over to the cla&s;&s;es for a public education. Their di&s;|cipline there was &s;till more rigid and &s;evere. They were &s;till obliged to go barefoot, their heads were &s;haved, and they fought with one another naked.</P>
<P>To enable them the better to endure bodily pain without complaining, they were annually whipt at the altar of Diana; and the boy that bore
<PB N="10" REF="20">
this puni&s;hment with the greate&s;t fortitude, came off victorious. Plutarch tells us, that he has &s;een &s;everal children expire under this cruel treatment; and he makes mention of one, who having &s;tolen a fox, and hid it under his coat, cho&s;e rather to let the animal tear out his bowels than di&s;cover the theft. In order to prepare them for the &s;tratagems of war, they were permitted to &s;teal from one another; but if they were caught in the fact, they were puni&s;hed for their want of dexterity. At twelve years of age they were removed into a cla&s;s of a more advanced kind. There their labour and di&s;cipline were increa&s;ed with their years. They had now their &s;kirmi&s;hes between &s;mall parties, and their mock fights between larger bodies; and in the&s;e they &s;ometimes fought with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy, that they were &s;een to lo&s;e their eyes, and even their lives, before they gave up the conte&s;t. Such was the con&s;tant di&s;cipline of their minority, which la&s;ted till the age of thirty, before which they were not permitted to marry, to go into the troops, or to bear any office in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The di&s;cipline of the virgins was as &s;evere as that of the young men. They were enured to a life of labour and indu&s;try till they were twenty years of age, before which time they were not allowed to be marriageable. They had al&s;o their peculiar exerci&s;es. They ran, wre&s;tled, and pitched the bar; and performed all the&s;e feats naked before the whole body of the citizens. Yet this was thought no way indecent, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that the frequent view of the per&s;on would tend rather to check than excite every irregular de&s;ire. An education &s;o man|like, did not fail to be&s;tow upon the Spartan wo|man equal vigour of body and mind. They were bold, hardy, and patriotic, filled with a &s;en&s;e of ho|nour, and a love of military glory. Some foreign women, in conver&s;ation with the wife of Leonidas,
<PB N="11" REF="21">
&s;aying, that the Spartan women alone knew how to govern the men, &s;he boldly replied, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Spartan women alone bring forth men."</Q> A mo|ther was known to give her &s;on, who was going to battle, his &s;hield, with this gallant advice, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Re|turn with it, or return upon it;"</Q> thereby in ef|fect telling him, that, rather than throw it away in flight, he &s;hould be borne home upon it dead. Ano|ther hearing that her &s;on was killed fighting for his country, &s;he an&s;wered without any emotion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was for that I brought him into the world."</Q> After the battle of Leuctra, the parents of tho&s;e who fell in the action, went to the temples to thank the gods that their &s;ons had done their duty, while tho&s;e who&s;e children &s;urvived that dreadful day were over|whelmed with grief.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e general regulations, there were many other &s;ubordinate maxims, that, by long and con|&s;tant practice, obtained the force of laws. The Spartans were expre&s;sly forbid to exerci&s;e any me|chanic art. War was their chief occupation, and in time of peace they employed them&s;elves in hunt|ing, or bodily exerci&s;es. The Helots, or &s;laves, tilled their lands for them, and received for their labour a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Nor was this the only hard&s;hip to which the&s;e unhappy men were &s;ubject. They were in a manner bound to the &s;oil, nor was it even lawful to &s;ell them to &s;trangers, or to make them free. Nay, if at any time their numbers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n|crea&s;ed to &s;uch a degree as to excite the &s;u&s;picion of their cruel ma&s;ters, there was a <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yptia,</HI> or <HI>&s;ecret act,</HI> by which it was permitted to de&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oy them with|out mercy. Thucydides relates, that two thou&s;and of the&s;e &s;laves di&s;appeared at once, without ever after be|ing heard of. Nor were they only thus wantonly put to death, they were even made a mockery of while living. They were frequently intoxicated on pur|po&s;e, and in that condition expo&s;ed before the
<PB N="12" REF="22">
children, in order to deter them from this kind of debauchery.</P>
<P>As to the citizens them&s;elves being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by means of their &s;laves, of competence and lei&s;ure, they were almo&s;t always in company in their large common halls, where they met and conver&s;ed with one another. The love of their country was their ruling pa&s;&s;ion, and all &s;elf-intere&s;t &s;eemed lo&s;t in the general wi&s;h for the welfare of the public. Pe|darctus having mi&s;&s;ed the honour of being cho&s;en one for the three hundred who had a certain rank in the city, converted his di&s;appointment into joy, <Q REND="inline">"that there were three hundred better men in Sparta than he."</Q></P>
<P>The Spartans were forbid to make frequent war upon the &s;ame people, le&s;t they &s;hould teach their di&s;cipline to others. When they had broken and routed their enemies, they never pur&s;ued them far|ther than was nece&s;&s;ary to make them&s;elves &s;ure of the victory. This had an excellent effect; for the enemy, knowing that all who re&s;i&s;ted were put to the &s;word, often fled, as they were convinced that this was the mo&s;t effectual means of en&s;uring their &s;afety. With the Spartans them&s;elves the ca&s;e was directly the rever&s;e. For their fir&s;t and mo&s;t invio|lable maxim, was never to turn their backs on the enemy, however unequal to them in numbers, nor ever to deliver up their arms till they re&s;igned them with their life. Nay, they would not &s;uffer the contrary notion to be propagated, or even men|tioned among them. For when the poet Archilo|chus came to Sparta, he was obliged to quit the city, for having a&s;&s;erted in one of his poems, that it was better for a man to lo&s;e his arms than his life. Thus depending upon their valour alone, their legi&s;|lator would not allow them to wall the city. It was his opinion, that a wall of men was preferable to a wall of brick; and that valour, which is obliged
<PB N="13" REF="23">
to take &s;helter within a fortification, is little better than cowardice.</P>
<P>Such was the general purport of the in&s;titutions of Lycurgus, which from their tendency gained the e&s;teem and admiration of all the &s;urrounding &s;tates. In order to render them as la&s;ting as they were ex|cellent, Lycurgus pretended, that &s;omething was &s;till wanting to the completion of his plan, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to go and con&s;ult the oracle of Delphos. In the mean time, he per&s;uaded his countrymen to take an oath for the &s;trict ob&s;ervance of all his laws till his return, and then left Sparta with a firm re&s;olution of never &s;eeing it more. When he arrived at Delphos, he enquired of the oracle, whether the laws he had made were &s;ufficient to render the Lacedaemonians happy; and being told that they were, he &s;ent this an&s;wer to Sparta, and then voluntarily &s;tarved him&s;elf to death. Others &s;ay, that he died in Crete, ordering his body to be burnt, and his a&s;hes to be thrown into the &s;ea. Whichever of the&s;e was the ca&s;e, he equally obliged his countrymen, by the oath they had taken, to ob|&s;erve his laws for ever; which, indeed, they were &s;ufficiently inclined to do, from a conviction of their real and intrin&s;ic merit.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t opportunity, which the Spartans had, to di&s;|play the &s;uperiority of their power among the neigh|bouring &s;tates, was in the war between them and the Me&s;&s;enians. This war la&s;ted twenty years, and is remarkable for two incidents that are well worthy of notice. The Spartans having drained their city of all its male inhabitants in order to carry on the war, and having bound them&s;elves by an oath not to return home till they had conquered the enemy; their women, in the mean time, remon&s;trated, that from their long ab&s;ence all po&s;terity would be at an end. To remedy this inconvenience, they detached
<PB N="14" REF="24">
fifty of their mo&s;t promi&s;ing young men from the army to go to Sparta, and to lie promi&s;cuou&s;ly with all the young women they plea&s;ed. The offspring of the&s;e virgins were from them called Partheniae, who finding them&s;elves de&s;pi&s;ed by the Spartans, on their return, as a &s;purious race, joined &s;ome years after in an in&s;urrection with the Helots, but were &s;oon &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. Being expelled the &s;tate, they went under the conduct of their Captain Phalantus, and &s;ettled at Tarentum in Italy.</P>
<P>The other incident is this. The Me&s;&s;enians having &s;ent to con&s;ult the oracle of Delphos, re|ceived for an&s;wer, that they mu&s;t offer a virgin of the family of Aepytus as a &s;acrifice. The lot fell upon the daughter of Lyci&s;cus; but &s;he being thought to be &s;uppo&s;ititious, Ari&s;todemus offered his daughter, whom all allowed to be his own. Her lover, however, attempted to avert the blow, by a&s;|&s;erting that &s;he was with child by him; but her father was &s;o enraged at the imputation, that he ripped up her belly with his own hands publicly, in order to vindicate her innocence. The enthu|&s;ia&s;m, produced by this &s;acrifice, &s;erved for a while to give the Me&s;&s;enians the advantage; but being at la&s;t overthrown and be&s;ieged in the city of I thoe, they were obliged to &s;ubmit to the Spartans, and Ari&s;todemus &s;lew him&s;elf on his daughter's grave.</P>
<P>After a rigorous &s;ubjection of thirty-nine years, the Me&s;&s;enians made one effort more for the reco|very of their liberty under the conduct of Ari&s;to|menes, who thrice defeated the Spartan army, and as often merited the Hecatomphonia, a &s;acrifice due to tho&s;e who had killed one hundred of the enemy hand to hand in battle. But the Spartans, being headed by the famous Athenian poet and &s;chool|ma&s;ter Tyrtaeus, who inflamed their courage by his &s;ongs and orations, the Me&s;&s;enians were at la&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="25">

<HEAD>CHAP. III. OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ATHENS, THE LAWS OF SOLON, AND THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC, FROM THE TIME OF SOLON TO THE COM|MENCEMENT OF THE PERSIAN WAR.</HEAD>
<P>THE happy effects produced at Sparta, by the in&s;titutions of Lycurgus, at la&s;t in &s;pired the Athenians with a de&s;ire of being governed by writ|ten laws; and the fir&s;t per&s;on they pitched upon for a legi&s;lator was Draco, a man of equal integrity and wi&s;dom, but rigid and &s;evere in the highe&s;t de|gree. <NOTE PLACE="foot">A. M. 3380.</NOTE>Draco inflicted death on all crimes without exception, and being a&s;ked why he did &s;o, replied, <Q REND="inline">"Small crimes de&s;erve death, and I have no higher puni&s;hment even for the greate&s;t."</Q> His laws, indeed, were &s;o &s;evere, that they were &s;aid to be written not with ink, but with blood. Their &s;everity, however, defeated their intention. It was impo&s;&s;ible to carry them into execution. They therefore fell into di&s;u&s;e; and the people, from the neglect and contempt of laws, &s;oon grew more licentious than ever they had been before any written laws exi&s;ted. It was in this di&s;|tre&s;sful &s;tate of the Republic, that Solon was applied to for his advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in regulating the government.</P>
<P>To mention all the proofs he had given of his wi&s;dom, before he was advanced to the office of legi|&s;lator, would be foreign to our purpo&s;e. Suffice it to &s;ay, that he was one of the &s;even wi&s;e men of
<PB N="16" REF="26">
Greece. The others were, Thales the Mile&s;ian, Chilo of Lacedaemon, Pittacus of Mitylene, Pe|riander of Corinth, and Bias and Cleobulus, who&s;e birth-places are uncertain. One day at the court of Periander, a que&s;tion was pro|po&s;ed, which was the mo&s;t perfect popular go|vernment? That, &s;aid Bias, where the laws have no &s;uperior. That, &s;aid Thales, where the people are neither too rich nor too poor. That, &s;aid Ana|char&s;is the Scythian, where virtue is honoured and vice dete&s;ted. That, &s;aid Pittacus, where dignities are always conferred upon the virtuous, and never upon the ba&s;e. That, &s;aid Cleobulus, where the citizens fear blame more than puni&s;hment. That, &s;aid Chilo, where the laws are more regarded than the orators. But Solon's opinion &s;eems to be be&s;t founded, who &s;aid, where an injury done to the meane&s;t &s;ubject is an in&s;ult upon the whole community.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t we omit his celebrated interview with Croe&s;us, king of Lydia. That monarch, who was reputed the riche&s;t prince of his time, having di&s;|played before him his immen&s;e wealth and trea&s;ures, a&s;ked, whether he did not think him the happie&s;t of mankind? No, replied Solon; I know one man more happy, a poor pea&s;ant of Greece, who, neither in affluence nor poverty, has but few wants, and has learned to &s;upply them by his own labour. But at lea&s;t, &s;aid the vain monarch, do you not think me happy? Alas, cried Solon, what man can be pro|nounced happy before he dies? The &s;agacity of Solon's replies appeared in the &s;equel. The king|dom of Lydia was invaded by Cyrus, the empire de&s;troyed, and Croe&s;us him&s;elf taken pri&s;oner. When he was led out to execution, according to the barbarous manners of the times, he then recol|lected the maxims of Solon, and could not help cry|ing out, when on the &s;caffold, upon Solon's name. Cyrus hearing him repeat the name with great ear|ne&s;tne&s;s,
<PB N="17" REF="27">
was de&s;irous of knowing the rea&s;on; and being informed by Croe&s;us of that philo&s;opher's re|markable ob&s;ervation, he began to fear for him&s;elf, pardoned Croe&s;us, and took him for the future into confidence and friend&s;hip. Thus Solon had the merit of &s;aving one king's life, and of reforming another.</P>
<P>Such was the man whom the Athenians how rai&s;ed to the high dignity of Archon, and inve&s;ted with full power to new-model the government. Solon, however, was &s;en&s;ible that there were cer|tain di&s;orders in the &s;tate that were altogether in|curable; and with the&s;e therefore he re&s;olved not in the lea&s;t to meddle. In a word, as he him&s;elf de|clared, he gave his countrymen not the be&s;t of all po&s;&s;ible laws, but the be&s;t they were capable of re|ceiving. His fir&s;t &s;tep was in favour of the poor, who&s;e debts he aboli&s;hed at once, and who had been grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed by the rich, by the exorbitant intere&s;t they exacted from them. But to do this with the lea&s;t injury he could to the creditor, he rai&s;ed the value of money a little, and by that means nominally increa&s;ed their riches. His next &s;tep was to repeal all the laws of Draco, except tho&s;e again&s;t murder. He then proceeded to the regulation of offices, employments, and magi&s;tracies, all which he left in the hands of the rich. He divided the rich citizens into three cla&s;&s;es, ranging them ac|cording to their incomes. Tho&s;e that had five hun|dred mea&s;ures yearly, as well in corn as liquids, were placed in the fir&s;t rank; tho&s;e that had three hundred were placed in the &s;econd; and tho&s;e that had but two hundred made up the third. All the re&s;t of the citizens, who&s;e income fell &s;hort of two hundred mea&s;ures, were compri&s;ed in a fourth and la&s;t cla&s;s, and were con&s;idered as incapable of hold|ing any employment whatever. But to compen&s;ate for this exclu&s;ion, he gave every private citizen a right
<PB N="18" REF="28">
to vote in the great a&s;&s;embly of the whole body of the people. And this, indeed, was a right of a mo&s;t important nature. For by the laws of Athens it was permitted, after the deci&s;ion of the magi&s;trates, to appeal to the general a&s;&s;embly of the people; and thus, in time, all cau&s;es of weight and con&s;equence came before them.</P>
<P>To counteract, however, the influence of a po|pular a&s;&s;embly, Solon gave greater weight to the court of Areopagus, and al&s;o in&s;tituted another council con&s;i&s;ting of four hundred. Before his time the Areopagus was compo&s;ed of &s;uch citizens as were mo&s;t remarkable for their probity and wi&s;dom. But Solon now ordained, that none &s;hould be ad|mitted into it, but &s;uch as had pa&s;&s;ed through the office of Archon. By this means the dignity, and con&s;equently the authority, of the court were greatly increa&s;ed: and &s;uch was its reputation for integrity and di&s;cernment, that the Romans &s;ometimes refer|red cau&s;es, which were too intricate for their own deci&s;ion, to the determination of this tribunal. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the council of four hundred was to judge upon appeals from the Areopagus, and ma|turely to examine every que&s;tion before it came be|fore the general a&s;&s;embly of the people.</P>
<P>Such was the reformation in the general plan of government; his particular laws for the admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice were more numerous, and equally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udicious. To promote a &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m, and prevent all &s;elfi&s;h indifference about the concerns of the Republic, he ordained, that whoever in public di&s;&s;en&s;ions e&s;pou&s;ed neither party, but remained neuter, &s;hould be declared infamous, condemned to perpetual exile, and to have all his e&s;tates confi&s;|cated. From a &s;imilar motive, he permitted every per&s;on to e&s;pou&s;e the quarrel of any one that was injured or in&s;ulted. He aboli&s;hed the cu&s;tom of giving portions with young women, unle&s;s they were
<PB N="19" REF="29">
only children. He wi&s;hed to render matrimony an honourable connection, and not, as it formerly had too often been, and &s;till continues to be, a mere matter of traffic. He allowed every one that was childle&s;s to di&s;po&s;e of his wealth as he plea&s;ed, with|out being obliged to leave it to the next of kin. By this means, the natural dependence of the young upon the old was &s;trengthened and increa&s;ed. He le&s;&s;ened the rewards of the victors at the Olympic and I&s;thmian games, whom he con&s;idered as an u&s;ele&s;s, and often a dangerous &s;et of citizens, and be&s;towed the money thus &s;aved upon the widows and children of tho&s;e who had fallen in the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>To encourage indu&s;try, he empowered the Areo|pagus to enquire into every man's method of pro|curing a livelihood, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as had no vi&s;ible way of doing &s;o. With the like view he or dained, that a &s;on &s;hould not be obliged to &s;upport his father in old age or nece&s;&s;ity, if the latter had neglected to give him &s;ome trade or calling; and all illegitimate children were exempted from the &s;ame duty, as they owed nothing to their parents but the &s;tigma of their birth. No one was allowed to revile another in public; the magi&s;trates were obliged to be particularly circum&s;pect in their behaviour; and it was even death for an Archon to be taken drunk. Again&s;t the crime of parricide he made no law, as &s;uppo&s;ing it could never exi&s;t in any &s;ociety. To pre&s;erve the &s;anctity of the marriage-bed, he per|mitted any one to kill an adulterer, if he was taken in the fact; and though he allowed of public bro|thels, he branded both the women and men who frequented them, with an indelible mark of di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Such were the chief in&s;titutions of this celebrated lawgiver, which he bound the Athenians, by a pub|lic oath, to ob&s;erve religiou&s;ly, at lea&s;t, for the &s;pace of a hundred years; and having thus completed the

ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, he &s;et out on his travels, leaving his countrymen to become habituated to the new form of government. But it was not ea&s;y for a people long torn by civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions to yield implicit obedience to any laws, however wi&s;ely framed; their for|mer animo&s;ities began to revive, when that authority was removed which alone could hold them in &s;ub|jection. The factions of the &s;tate were headed by three different leaders, Pi&s;i&s;tratus, Megacles, and Lycurgus. Of the&s;e Pi&s;i&s;tratus was at once the mo&s;t powerful, the mo&s;t artful, and in the end the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. He had many virtues, and hardly a &s;ingle vice, except that of an inordinate ambition. He was learned him&s;elf, and an encourager of learn|ing in others. Cicero &s;ays, he was the fir&s;t that made the Athenians acquainted with the works of Homer; that he di&s;po&s;ed of them in the order in which we now have them, and fir&s;t cau&s;ed them to be read at the fea&s;ts called Panathenaea.</P>
<P>By his promi&s;es, his profe&s;&s;ions, his liberality and addre&s;s, he &s;o far gained upon the affections of his countrymen, that he was ju&s;t upon the point of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the government, when he had the mortification to &s;ee Solon return, after an ab&s;ence of ten years, fully appri&s;ed of his treacherous de&s;igns, and determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent their completion. This, however, he could not do for any length of time; for Pi&s;i&s;tratus now finding his &s;chemes ripe for execution, gave him&s;elf &s;everal wounds, which he pretended to have received in the cau&s;e of the people; and in that condition, with his body all bloody, he ordered him&s;elf to be car|ried in his chariot to the market-place, where, by his complaints and eloquence, he &s;o inflamed the minds of the populace, that he obtained a guard of fifty per&s;ons for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on. This was all he aimed at; for having now got the rudiments of a &s;tanding army, he &s;oon increa&s;ed it to &s;uch a de|gree,
<PB N="21" REF="31">
as to enable him to &s;et all oppo&s;ition at de|fiance. In a little time, therefore, he &s;eized upon the citadel, and in effect u&s;urped the &s;upreme power. Solon did not long &s;urvive the liberties of his coun|try. He died about two years after, at the age of eighty, admired and lamented by all the &s;tates of Greece, as the greate&s;t legi&s;lator, and, excepting Ho|mer, the greate&s;t poet that had hitherto appeared.</P>
<P>By adhering to the &s;ame arts by which he had acquired his power, Pi&s;i&s;tratus contrived to main|tain him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it to his dying day, and tran&s;mitted it to his two &s;ons, Hippias and Hipparchus. The&s;e young men &s;eemed to tread in the foot&s;teps of their father. They encouraged learning and learned men. They invited to their court Anacreon, Simonides, and other poets, and honoured them with their friend&s;hip, and loaded them with pre&s;ents. They e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;chools for the improvement of youth, and cau&s;ed Mercuries to be erected in all the highways, with moral &s;en|tences written upon them, for the in&s;truction of the lowe&s;t vulgar. Their reign, however, la&s;ted but eighteen years, and terminated upon the following occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Harmodius and Ari&s;togiton, two citizens of Athens, had contracted a mo&s;t &s;incere and invio|lable friend&s;hip, and re&s;olved to con&s;ider any in&s;ult that &s;hould be offered to either as an injury done to both. Hipparchus, being naturally of an amo|rous di&s;po&s;ition, debauched the &s;i&s;ter of Harmodius, and afterwards publi&s;hed her &s;hame as &s;he was about to walk in one of the &s;acred proce&s;&s;ions, alledging that &s;he was not in a condition to a&s;&s;i&s;t at the cere|mony. Such an indignity was not to be borne; and they therefore re&s;olved to de&s;troy the tyrant, which, after various efforts, they at la&s;t effected, though they them&s;elves fell in the attempt. Hippias naturally wreaked his re&s;entment upon all whom he &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="22" REF="32">
privy to the con&s;piracy, and, among others, upon a courtezan of the name of Leona, who&s;e courage and con&s;tancy de&s;erve to be mentioned. When put to the torture, &s;he bore all the cruelty of her execu|tioners with invincible fortitude; and le&s;t &s;he &s;hould, in the agony of pain, be induced to a confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he bit off her tongue, and &s;pit it in the tyrant's face. To perpetuate her memory, the Athenians erected a &s;tatue, repre&s;enting a lione&s;s without a tongue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3496.</NOTE> Hippias, dreading the fate of his brother, endea|voured to fortify him&s;elf by foreign alliances, and particularly by one with the Lacedaemonians; but in this he was prevented by the family of the Alc|maeonidae, who had been bani&s;hed from Athens at the beginning of the u&s;urpation, and who having rebuilt the temple of Delphos in a mo&s;t magni|ficent manner, had &s;ecured the prie&s;te&s;s in their in|tere&s;t. Whenever, therefore, the Spartans came to con&s;ult the Oracle, they never received any pro|mi&s;e of the God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but upon condition of &s;etting Athens free. This ta&s;k, therefore, they re|&s;olved to undertake; and, though un&s;ucce&s;sful in their fir&s;t attempt, they at la&s;t dethroned the tyrant the very &s;ame year in which the kings were expelled from Rome. The family of Alcmaeon were chiefly in&s;trumental in this great work; but the people &s;eemed fonder of acknowledging their obligations to the two friends who &s;truck the fir&s;t blow.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. FROM THE EXPULSION OF HIPPIAS, TO THE DEATH OF MILTIADES.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Hippias, upon being driven from the throne, was obliged to abandon his native country, he did not, however, abandon all hopes of being able, &s;ome time or other, to recover his lo&s;t power. He fir&s;t applied to the Lacedaemonians, and that people &s;eemed &s;ufficiently willing to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e; and they thought they might the more ea&s;ily effect his re&s;toration, as Athens was at this time thrown into confu&s;ion, by the introduction of the new mode of voting by o&s;traci&s;m, that is of pro|curing the bani&s;hment of any citizen for ten years, who&s;e wealth or popularity rendered him dangerous to the &s;tate, by allowing every one above &s;ixty years of age to give in the name of the obnoxious per&s;on, written upon a tile or oy&s;ter-&s;hell. Before they un|dertook, however, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Hippias in re-a&s;cending the throne, they thought it prudent to con&s;ult the other &s;tates of Greece with regard to the propriety of the mea&s;ure, and finding them all to be totally aver&s;e to it, they abandoned the tyrant and his cau&s;e for ever.</P>
<P>Hippias, di&s;appointed in his hopes of aid from the Lacedaemonians, had recour&s;e to one whom he con|&s;idered as a much more powerful patron. This was Artaphernes, governor of Sardis, for the king of Per&s;ia. To him he repre&s;ented the facility with which an entire conque&s;t might be made of Athens; and the Per&s;ian court, influenced by the pro&s;pect of gaining &s;uch an addition of territory, and particu|larly &s;uch an extent of &s;ea-coa&s;t, readily adopted the propo&s;al. When the Athenians, therefore, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger into Per&s;ia to vindicate their proceed|ings with regard to Hippias, they received for an&s;wer,
<PB N="24" REF="34">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if they wi&s;hed to be &s;afe, they mu&s;t admit Hippias for their king.</Q> But the&s;e gallant re|publicans had too ardent a pa&s;&s;ion for liberty, and too rooted an aver&s;ion to &s;lavery, patiently to &s;ubmit to &s;o imperious a mandate. They, there|fore, returned to it a flat and peremptory refu&s;al. And from that time forward the Athenians and Per&s;ians began to prepare for commencing ho&s;ti|lities again&s;t each other.</P>
<P>The gallantry, indeed, of the Athenians, upon this occa&s;ion, is the more to be admired, as their numbers and re&s;ources bore no proportion to tho&s;e of the prince whom they thus &s;et at defiance. The Per&s;ian monarch was, at that time, the mo&s;t power|ful &s;overeign in the univer&s;e; whereas the &s;mall &s;tate of Athens did not contain above twenty thou&s;and citizens, ten thou&s;and &s;trangers, and about fifty or &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;ervants. The &s;tate of Sparta, which afterwards took &s;uch a con&s;iderable &s;hare, and made &s;o capital a figure in the war again&s;t Per&s;ia, was &s;till more incon&s;iderable with re&s;pect to numbers. The&s;e did not amount to above nine thou&s;and citizens, and about thirty thou&s;and pea&s;ants. And yet the&s;e two &s;tates, with very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the inferior republics, were able not only to re&s;i&s;t, but even to baffle and defeat all the attempts of the Per&s;ian monarch; a memorable in&s;tance what acts of heroi&s;m may be performed by men animated by a love of freedom, and in&s;pired with a pa&s;&s;ion for military glory.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of Hippias was not the only cau&s;e of quarrel between the Per&s;ians and the Athenians. The Greek colonies of lonia, Aeolia, and Caria, that had been &s;ettled for above five hundred years in A&s;ia Minor, were at length &s;ubdued by Croe&s;us king of Lydia; and he, in turn, &s;inking under the power of Cyrus, his conque&s;ts, of cour&s;e, fell in with the re&s;t of his dominions. The&s;e colonies,
<PB N="25" REF="35">
however, had not yet lo&s;t all memory of the liberty they had formerly enjoyed; and they therefore &s;eiz|ed every opportunity of delivering them&s;elves from the Per&s;ian yoke, and recovering their ancient in|dependence. In this they were now encouraged by Hi&s;tiaeus, the governor, or tyrant as he was called, of Miletus; for all the Per&s;ian governors of the&s;e provinces were by the Greeks called tyrants. This man, having rendered his fidelity &s;u&s;pected at the Per&s;ian court, had no other way of providing for his own &s;afety than by exciting the Ionians to a revolt. By his direction, therefore, Ari&s;tagoras, his deputy, fir&s;t applied to the Lacedaemonians for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and failing of &s;ucce&s;s in that quarter, he next had recour&s;e to the Athenians, where he met with a more favourable reception. The Athenians were at this time inflamed with the highe&s;t re&s;entment again&s;t the Per&s;ian monarch, on account of his naughty mandate with regard to the re&s;toration of Hippias; and they therefore &s;upplied the Ionians with twenty &s;hips, to which the Eretrians and Eu|poeans added five more.</P>
<P>Thus &s;upported, Ari&s;tagoras entered the Per&s;ian territories, and penetrating into the heart of Lydia, he burned Sardis the capital city; but being &s;oon after de&s;erted by the Athenians, on account of &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hecks he received, he found him&s;elf altogether un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to make head again&s;t the power of Per&s;ia; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hough he contrived to maintain the &s;truggle for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pace of &s;ix years, yet he was at la&s;t obliged to fly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto Thrace, where he was cut off with all his fol|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owers.

<P><PB N="26" REF="36">The commencement of this war naturally tended to widen the breach between the Athenians and Per&s;ians, and the conclu&s;ion of it was no le&s;s cal|culated to inflame the pride and pre&s;umption of the latter, and to in&s;pire them with the ambitious thoughts of making an entire conque&s;t of Greece. To pave the way for this grand project, Darius, in the twenty-eighth year of his reign, having recalled all his other generals, &s;ent his &s;on-in-law, Mardo|nius, to command throughout the maritime parts of A&s;ia, and particularly to revenge the burning of Sar|dis, which he could neither forgive nor forget. But his fleet being &s;hattered in a &s;torm in doubling the cape of Mount Athos, and his army repul&s;ed, and him&s;elf wounded, by the Thracians, who attacked him &s;uddenly by night, Mardonius returned to the Per&s;ian court, covered with &s;hame and confu&s;ion for having mi&s;carried in his enterprize both by &s;ea and land. Darius, therefore, di&s;placed him, and ap|pointed two older and abler generals, namely, Da|tis, a Mede, and Artaphernes, &s;on of the late go|vernor of Sardis, in his &s;tead. At the &s;ame time he exerted him&s;elf with unwearied diligence, in fur|ni&s;hing them with &s;uch an army and navy as might render them morally certain of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Previous, however, to his inva&s;ion of Greece, he thought it became his dignity and humanity to &s;end heralds into that country to require &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the different &s;tates, or to threaten them with his vengeance in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. The le&s;&s;er &s;tates, intimidated by his power, readily &s;ubmitted; but the Athenians and Spartans nobly di&s;dained to acknow|ledge &s;ubjection to any earthly &s;overeign. When, therefore, the heralds demanded earth and water, the u&s;ual method of requiring &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from infe|rior &s;tates, the&s;e &s;pirited republicans threw the one into a well, and the other into a ditch, and taunt|ingly

bid them take earth and water from thence.

<P>In the mean time Darius, having completed his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vies, &s;ent away his generals, Datis and Arta|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hernes, to what be con&s;idered as a certain con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e&s;t.

<P>To oppo&s;e this formidable inva&s;ion, the Athenians <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d only about ten thou&s;and men, but all of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">imated with that invincible &s;pirit which the love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> liberty ever in&s;pires.

replied he, that I &s;hould ever &s;it upon a tribunal where my friends &s;hould find no more favour than &s;trangers."</Q> As to Ari&s;tides, he was &s;o rigidly and inflexibly ju&s;t, that his name has de&s;cended to po&s;|terity as almo&s;t another term for ju&s;tice it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t brunt of the war fell upon the Eretri|ans, who being utterly unable to oppo&s;e &s;o mighty a force in the field, &s;hut them&s;elves up in the town; but though they defended the place with great gal|lantry, yet, after a &s;iege of &s;even days, it was taken by &s;torm, and reduced to a&s;hes. The inhabitants were put in chains, and &s;ent as the fir&s;t-fruits of vic|tory to the Per&s;ian monarch; but he, contrary to their expectation, treated them with great lenity, and gave them a village in the country of Ci&s;&s;a for their re&s;idence, where Apollonius Tyanaeus found their de&s;cendants &s;ix hundred years after.</P>
<P>Elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, the Per&s;ians advanced into the heart of the country, and being directed in their march by Hippias, the expelled tyrant of Athens, they &s;oon arrived in the plains of Mara|thon, about ten miles di&s;tant from that city. There, however, it was that the Athenians re&s;olved to op|po&s;e them; but not thinking them&s;elves &s;ingly equal to &s;uch an undertaking, they fir&s;t &s;ent to the Spar|tans for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and would certainly have obtain|ed it, had it not been for a fooli&s;h &s;uper&s;tition which prevailed among that people, and which would not allow them to begin a march before the full moon. They then applied to the other &s;tates of Greece; but the&s;e were too much intimidated by the power of Per&s;ia to venture to move in their defence.</P>
<P>Obliged, therefore, to depend upon their own courage alone, they collected all their forces, to the number of ten thou&s;and men, and entru&s;ted the command of them to ten generals, of whom Mil|tiades was the chief; and each of the&s;e was to have the direction of the troops for one day at a time in
<PB N="29" REF="39">
regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. But this arrangement was &s;oon found to be &s;o very inconvenient, that, by the ad|vice of Ari&s;tides, the chief command was ve&s;ted in Miltiades alone, as the able&s;t and mo&s;t experienced of all the generals. At the &s;ame time it was re|&s;olved in a council of war, though only by a ma|jority of one vote, to meet the enemy in the open field, in&s;tead of waiting for them within the walls of the city.</P>
<P>Miltiades, &s;en&s;ible of the inferiority of his num|bers when compared to tho&s;e of the enemy, endea|voured to make up for this defect by taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of an advantageous ground. He, therefore, drew up his army at the foot of a mountain, &s;o that the enemy &s;hould not be able to &s;urround him or charge him in the rear. At the &s;ame time he for|tified his flanks with a number of large trees, that were cut down for the purpo&s;e. Datis &s;aw the ad|vantage which the Athenians mu&s;t derive from this ma&s;terly di&s;po&s;ition; but relying on the &s;uperiority of his numbers, and unwilling to wait till the Spar|tan &s;uccours &s;hould arrive, he re&s;olved to begin the engagement. The &s;ignal for battle, however, was no &s;ooner given than the Athenians, in&s;tead of wait|ing for the on&s;et of the enemy, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, ru&s;hed in upon them with irre&s;i&s;tible fury. The Per&s;ians regarded this fir&s;t &s;tep as the re&s;ult of madne&s;s and de&s;pair, rather than of deli|berate courage; but they were &s;oon convinced of their mi&s;take when they found, that the Athenians maintained the charge with the &s;ame &s;pirit with which they had begun it. Miltiades had purpo&s;ely and judiciou&s;ly made his wings much &s;tronger than his center, which was commanded by Themi&s;tocles and Ari&s;tides. The Per&s;ians, availing them&s;elves of this circum&s;tance, attacked the center with great bravery, and were ju&s;t upon the point of making it give way, when the two wings, having now become
<PB N="30" REF="40">
victorious, &s;uddenly wheeled about, and falling up|on the enemy in both flanks at once, threw them into di&s;order. The rout in a moment became uni|ver&s;al, and they fled to their &s;hips with great precipi|tation. The Athenians pur&s;ued them as far as the beach, and even &s;et &s;everal of their &s;hips on fire. It was on this occa&s;ion that Cynaegyrus, the brother of the poet Ae&s;chylus, &s;eized one of the enemy's &s;hips with his right hand, as they were pu&s;hing it off from the &s;hore. When his right hand was cut off, he laid hold of the ve&s;&s;el with his left; and that likewi&s;e being lopt off, he at la&s;t &s;eized it with his teeth, and in that manner expired.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3514.</NOTE> Seven of the enemy's &s;hips were taken, and above &s;ix thou&s;and of them left dead upon the field of bat|tle, not to mention tho&s;e who were drowned as they were endeavouring to e&s;cape, or were con&s;umed in the &s;hips that were &s;et on fire. Of the Greeks there fell not above two hundred, and among the&s;e was Callimachus, who gave the ca&s;ting vote for fighting the enemy in the field.

<P>Such was the famous battle of Marathon, one of the mo&s;t important that is to be found in hi&s;tory, as it fir&s;t taught the Greeks to de&s;pi&s;e the power of the Per&s;ian monarch, and bravely to maintain their own independence; and thus to go on cultivating tho&s;e arts and &s;ciences, which had &s;o evident a ten|dency to poli&s;h and refine their own manners, and have &s;ince diffu&s;ed their benign influence over all the re&s;t of Europe.</P>
<P>Of the marble which the Per&s;ians had brought with them to erect a monument in memory of their ex|pected victory, the Athenians now cau&s;ed a &s;tatue to be made by the celebrated &s;culptor Phidias, to tran&s;mit

Monuments were at the &s;ame time erected to the memory of all tho&s;e who had fallen in the battle; and upon the&s;e were in&s;cribed their own names, and the name of the tribe to which they belonged. Of the&s;e monuments there were three kinds; one for the Athenians, one for the Plataeans their allies, and one for the &s;laves, who had been enrolled into the troops upon this pre&s;&s;ing emergency. To expre&s;s their gratitude to Miltiades, the Athenians cau&s;ed a picture to be painted by one of their mo&s;t eminent arti&s;ts, named Polygnotus, in which that great commander was repre&s;ented at the head of the other generals, ani|mating the troops, and &s;etting them an example of bravery.</P>
<P>But their gratitude to this celebrated warrior, however &s;incere, was by no means la&s;ting. The Athenians, with all their good qualities, were na|turally fickle, and apt to be jealous of &s;uch as, either by their merit, their power, or popularity, had, in their opinion, rendered them&s;elves dangerous to the &s;tate. Of this Miltiades had very &s;oon after a mor|tifying proof. For having received a wound in an expedition again&s;t the Parians, and being thereby prevented from appearing in public to defend him&s;elf from a charge of bribery, which was brought again&s;t him by one Xanthippus, &s;entence was of cour&s;e pa&s;&s;ed upon him in his ab&s;ence, and he was con|demned to lo&s;e his life. This &s;evere &s;entence, how|ever, the Athenians had not the effrontery to exe|cute upon one who had done them &s;uch e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices, and they therefore changed it into a fine of fifty talents; and as this was a &s;um which Mil|tiades could not pay, he was thrown into pri&s;on, where he &s;oon after died. But the Athenians would not &s;uffer his body to be buried till the fine was

paid. His &s;on Cimon, therefore, by exerting all his intere&s;t among his friends and relations, was at la&s;t able to rai&s;e the requi&s;ite &s;um to pay the fine, and to procure his father an honourable interment.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. FROM THE DEATH OF MILTIADES TO THE RE|TREAT OF XERXES OUT OF GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>DARIUS, rather enraged than intimidated by the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained in the battle of Ma|rathon, was preparing to invade Greece in per&s;on, when, happily for the peace of that country, death put an end to his ambitious project. His &s;on Xerxes, however, who &s;ucceded him on the throne, was determined to execute the plan which his father had formed. Having ju&s;t returned from a &s;ucce&s;s|ful expedition he had made into Egypt, he expected to meet with the like good fortune in Europe. Con|fident of victory, he did not chu&s;e, he &s;aid, for the future to buy the figs of Attica; he would po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the country, and thus have figs of his own. But before he would engage in &s;o important an enterprize, he thought proper to con&s;ult the prin|cipal officers of his court. Mardonius, his brother-in-law, well knowing his &s;ecret &s;entiments, and willing to flatter him in his favourite pur&s;uits, high|ly applauded the re&s;olution he had taken. But Ar|tabanus, his uncle, whom years and experience had rendered wife, u&s;ed every argument he could think of, in order to divert him from his ra&s;h de&s;ign, and he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the king in the following terms:</P>
<P>"Permit me, Sir, &s;aid he, to deliver my &s;enti|ments upon this occa&s;ion with that liberty which be|comes my age, and my regard for your intere&s;t.
<PB N="33" REF="43">
When Darius, your father, and my brother, fir&s;t thought of making war upon the Scythians, I u&s;ed all my endeavours to divert him from it. The people you are going to attack are infinitely more formidable than they. If the Athenians alone could defeat the numerous army commanded by Datis and Artaphernes, what ought we to expect from an op|po&s;ition of all the &s;tates of Greece united? You de&s;ign to pa&s;s from A&s;ia into Europe, by laying a bridge over the &s;ea. But what if the Athenians &s;hould advance and de&s;troy this bridge, and &s;o pre|vent our return? Let us not expo&s;e our&s;elves to &s;uch dangers, e&s;pecially as we have no &s;ufficient motives to induce us to run &s;uch ri&s;ks; at lea&s;t let us take time to reflect upon the matter. When we have maturely con&s;idered an affair, whatever happens to be the &s;ucce&s;s of it, we have nothing to regret. Precipitation is imprudent, and is u&s;ually un&s;uc|ce&s;sful. Above all, do not &s;uffer your&s;elf, great prince, to be dazzled with the &s;plendor of ima|ginary glory. The highe&s;t trees have the mo&s;t rea|&s;on to dread being &s;truck with the thunder. As for you, Mardonius, who &s;o earne&s;tly urge this ex|pedition, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, lead it forward. But let the king, who&s;e life is dear to us all, return into Per&s;ia. In the mean time, let your children and mine be given up as a pledge to an&s;wer for the &s;ucce&s;s of the war. If the i&s;&s;ue be favourable, I con&s;ent that mine be put to death; but if it be otherwi&s;e, as I fore&s;ee it will, then I de&s;ire that you and your children may receive the reward of ra&s;h|ne&s;s." The pride of the Per&s;ian monarch could not ea&s;ily bear &s;uch a plain but hone&s;t &s;peech even from an uncle; and he therefore &s;ternly replied, <Q REND="inline">"Thank the gods that thou art my father's bro|ther; were it not for that, thou &s;hould&s;t this mo|ment receive the ju&s;t reward of thy audacious be|haviour. But you &s;hall have your puni&s;hment;
<PB N="34" REF="44">
remain here behind among the women; the&s;e you but too much re&s;emble in your cowardice and fear. Stay here, while I march at the head of my troops where my duty and glory call me."</Q></P>
<P>Xerxes having thus re&s;olved upon his expedition into Greece, began to make preparations for carry|ing it forward; and the greatne&s;s of the&s;e &s;hewed the high &s;en&s;e he entertained of the power and bravery of the enemy. Sardis was the place of ge|neral rendezvous for his land forces; and the fleet was ordered to advance along the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia Minor, towards the Helle&s;pont. In its way thither, in order to &s;horten its pa&s;&s;age, he cut a canal through the neck of land that joined Mount Athos to the continent; and while this was doing, he addre&s;&s;ed the mountain with all that pomp and o&s;tentation for which the Ea&s;tern princes have ever been &s;o remarkable. <Q REND="inline">"Athos," &s;aid he, "thou proud a&s;|piring mountain, that lifte&s;t up thy head unto the heavens, be not &s;o audacious to put ob&s;tacles in my way. If thou do&s;t, I will cut thee level with the plain, and throw thee headlong into the &s;ea."</Q></P>
<P>In his march to Sardis, he gave a &s;hocking proof of the extreme acts of cruelty he was capable of committing whenever his authority was called in que&s;tion. Having required the elde&s;t &s;on of Py|thias, a Lydian prince, to attend him in the war, the father offered him all his trea&s;ure, amounting to about four millions &s;terling, to purcha&s;e his exemp|tion; and as the young man &s;eemed de&s;irous of &s;taying at home, Xerxes commanded him imme|diately to be put to death before his father's eyes. Then cau&s;ing the body to be cut in two, and one part of it to be placed on the right, and the other on the left, he made his whole army pa&s;s between them, a terrible example of what every one had to expect that dared to di&s;pute his orders.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="45">His army was compo&s;ed not merely of Per&s;ians, but of Medes, Lydians, Bactrians, A&s;&s;yrians, Hyr|canians, in a word, of every people that either ac|knowledged his authority, dreaded his power, or courted his alliance. It is &s;aid to have amounted to above two millions of men. His fleet con&s;i&s;ted of fourteen hundred and twenty-&s;even &s;hips, be&s;ides a thou&s;and le&s;&s;er ve&s;&s;els that were employed in carry|ing provi&s;ions. On board of the&s;e were &s;ix hundred thou&s;and men; &s;o that the whole army might be &s;aid to amount to above two millions and a half; which, with the women, &s;laves, and &s;utlers, always attending a Per&s;ian camp, might make the whole about five millions of &s;ouls: a force which, if rightly conducted, might have given law to the univer&s;e; but being commanded by ignorance and pre&s;ump|tion, was &s;oon after repul&s;ed, and finally defeated by the &s;mall but gallant &s;tates of Greece.</P>
<P>With this mighty armament Xerxes &s;et out on his expedition into Greece, ten years after the battle of Marathon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3523.</NOTE> Upon review|ing his forces his heart was naturally elated with joy, from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;uperior power: but this &s;oon gave place to the feelings of humanity, and he bur&s;t into tears when he reflected that, a hundred years hence, not one of &s;o many thou&s;ands would be alive. He had previou&s;ly given orders for building a bridge of boats acro&s;s the Hel|le&s;pont, or, as it is now called, the Dardanelles, which &s;eparates A&s;ia from Europe, and is about an Engli&s;h mile over. But this bridge, when com|pleted, being carried away by the current, Xerxes, like a tyrant, wreaked his vengeance upon the workmen, and, like a lunatic, upon the &s;ea. He cau&s;ed the heads of the former to be &s;truck off, and a certain number of la&s;hes to be inflicted upon the latter, to puni&s;h it for its in&s;olence; and fetters to be thrown into it, to teach it, for the future, obedi|ence
<PB N="36" REF="46">
to his will: a &s;triking proof how much the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of de&s;potic power tends not only to corrupt the heart, but even to weaken and blind the under|&s;tanding. Another and a &s;tronger bridge was &s;oon after built, and over this the army pa&s;&s;ed; though, &s;uch was its immen&s;e number, the whole could not cro&s;s in le&s;s than &s;even days.</P>
<P>Xerxes having thus reached Europe, began his march directly for Greece, receiving every where the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the countries through which he pa&s;&s;ed. Even the &s;maller &s;tates of Greece, over|awed by his power, &s;ubmitted at the fir&s;t &s;ummons. Athens and Sparta alone, tho&s;e glorious republics, nobly di&s;dained &s;uch pu&s;illanimous conduct. They gallantly re&s;olved to oppo&s;e the invader of their country, and either to pre&s;erve their liberties entire, or to peri&s;h in the attempt. From the moment that Xerxes began his preparations, they had received intelligence of his de&s;igns; and they, in their turn, began to take mea&s;ures for rendering them abortive. They had al&s;o &s;ent &s;pies to Sardis, in order to bring them an exact account of the number and quality of the enemy's forces. The &s;pies, indeed, were &s;eized; but Xerxes, in&s;tead of puni&s;hing, or even detaining them, ordered them to be conducted through his camp, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, de&s;iring them at the &s;ame time, on their return home, to give a faithful rela|tion of what they had &s;een. The Athenians and Spartans, however, neither intimidated by the mighty force that now came again&s;t them, nor by the ba&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the inferior &s;tates, nobly re&s;olved to face the common danger with joint forces. The&s;e forces did not amount to above eleven thou&s;and two hundred men; and yet with this handful of troops, they determined to oppo&s;e the almo&s;t innumerable army of Xerxes.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t care was to appoint a general; and they wi&s;ely made choice of Themi&s;tocles, the able&s;t
<PB N="37" REF="47">
commander that had appeared in Greece &s;ince the death of Miltiades. They likewi&s;e recalled Ari&s;ti|des, who had been driven into bani&s;hment by the faction of his enemies; at the head of which, in|deed, was Themi&s;tocles; &s;uch is the jealou&s;y that &s;ometimes prevails between great men, though equally attached to the intere&s;t of their country! It was upon the occa&s;ion of his bani&s;hment that a pea&s;ant, who could not write, and did not know Ari&s;tides per&s;onally, applied to him, and de&s;ired him to write the name of that citizen upon the &s;hell, by which his vote was given again&s;t him. <Q REND="inline">"Has he done you any wrong," &s;aid Ari&s;tides, "that you are for condemning him in this manner?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No," replied the pea&s;ant, "but I hate to hear him always prai&s;ed for his ju&s;tice."</Q> Ari&s;tides, without &s;aying a word more, calmly took the &s;hell, wrote down his name upon it, and contentedly retired into exile. Themi&s;tocles, however, convinced of his uncom|mon merit, and willing to have the benefit of his coun&s;els, was now as de&s;irous of having him re|called, as ever he had been to &s;ee him bani&s;hed; and the&s;e two great men, generou&s;ly forgetting all their private feuds and animo&s;ities, re&s;olved to exert their joint efforts in promoting the good of the public.</P>
<P>Themi&s;tocles &s;aw that the enemy mu&s;t be op|po&s;ed by &s;ea as well as by land; and to enable him to do this with the greater effect, he had lately cau&s;ed an hundred gallies to be built, and turned all his thoughts towards the improvement of the navy. The oracle had declared &s;ome time before, that Athens &s;hould only defend her&s;elf with wooden walls; and he took the advantage of this ambiguity to per&s;uade his countrymen, that by &s;uch walls was only meant her &s;hipping. The Lacedaemonians u&s;ed no le&s;s indu&s;try in improving their navy, &s;o that, upon the approach of Xerxes, the confederates
<PB N="38" REF="48">
found them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;quadron of two hun|dred and eighty &s;ail, the command of which was conferred upon Eurybiades, a Spartan.</P>
<P>The next point to be determined was, which was the mo&s;t proper place for making the fir&s;t &s;tand again&s;t the enemy; and, after &s;ome deliberation, the &s;traits of Thermopylae were pitched upon for the purpo&s;e. This was a narrow pa&s;s of twenty-five feet broad, between The&s;&s;aly and Phocis, defended by the remains of an old wall, with gates to it, and remarkable for &s;ome hot baths, from whence the place had its name. The command of this im|portant pa&s;s was given to Leonidas, one of the kings of Sparta, who led thither a body of &s;ix thou&s;and men. Of the&s;e three hundred only were Spartans; the re&s;t con&s;i&s;ted of Boeotians, Corinthians, Pho|cians, and other allies. This cho&s;en band were taught from the beginning to look upon them&s;elves as a forlorn hope, only placed there to check the progre&s;s of the enemy, and give them a foreta&s;te of the de&s;perate valour of Greece; nor were even ora|cles wanting to in&s;pire them with enthu&s;ia&s;tic ar|dour. It had been declared, that to procure the &s;afety of Greece, it was nece&s;&s;ary that a king, one of the de&s;cendants of Hercules, &s;hould die; and this ta&s;k was now cheerfully undertaken by Leonidas, who, when he marched out of Lacedaemon, con&s;i|dered him&s;elf as a willing &s;acrifice offered up for the good of his country.</P>
<P>In the mean time Xerxes advanced with his im|men&s;e army, the very &s;ight of which, he thought, would terrify the Greeks into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, without his being obliged to &s;trike a &s;ingle blow. Great, therefore, was his &s;urprize, when he found that a few de&s;perate men were determined to di&s;pute his pa&s;&s;age through the &s;traits of Thermopylae. At fir&s;t be could not believe they would per&s;evere in their re&s;olution; and he therefore gave them four days
<PB N="39" REF="49">
to reflect on their danger, hoping they would at la&s;t think it mo&s;t prudent to retire. But when he found them remain immoveable in their po&s;t, he &s;ent them a &s;ummons to deliver up their arms. Leonidas, with a true Spartan contempt, de&s;ired him <Q REND="inline">"to come and take them."</Q> And when &s;ome people &s;aid that the Per&s;ian forces were &s;o numerous that their very darts would darken the &s;un, <Q REND="inline">"Then," replied Dieneces, a Spartan, "we &s;hall fight in the &s;hade."</Q></P>
<P>Xerxes, provoked at the&s;e &s;arca&s;ms, re&s;olved to begin the attack immediately. The fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault was made by a body of Medes, but the&s;e were in&s;tantly repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter. A body of ten thou|&s;and Per&s;ians, commonly known by the name of the immortal band, made another attempt to di&s;lodge the Grecians, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than the former. In a word, the Greeks maintained their ground again&s;t the whole power of the Per&s;ian army for two days together; and would probably have maintained it much longer, had it not been for the treachery of Epialtes, a Trachinian, who, having de&s;erted to the enemy, conducted a body of twenty thou&s;and Per&s;ians through a by-path to the top of a mountain that overhung the &s;traits.</P>
<P>Leonidas &s;eeing the enemy in this &s;ituation, plain|ly perceived that his po&s;t was no longer tenable. He therefore advi&s;ed his allies to retire, and re&s;erve them&s;elves for better times, and the future &s;afety of Greece. As for him&s;elf and his fellow-Spartans, they were obliged by their laws not to fly; that he owed a life to his country, and that it was now his duty to fall in its defence. Thus, having di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed all but his three hundred Spartans, with &s;ome The&s;pians and Thebans, in all not a thou&s;and men, he exhorted his followers in the mo&s;t cheerful man|ner to prepare for death. <Q REND="inline">"Come, my fellow &s;ol|diers," &s;ays he, "let us dine cheerfully here, for to|night we &s;hall &s;up with Pluto."</Q> His men, upon
<PB N="40" REF="50">
hearing his determined purpo&s;e, &s;et up a loud &s;hout, as if they had been invited to a banquet, and re|&s;olved every man to &s;ell his life as dearly as he could. The night now began to advance, and this was thought the mo&s;t glorious opportunity of meeting death in the enemy's camp, where darkne&s;s, by hiding the &s;mallne&s;s of their numbers, would fill the Per&s;ians with greater con&s;ternation. Thus re|&s;olved, they made directly to the Per&s;ian tents, and, in the &s;ilence of the night, had almo&s;t penetrated to the royal pavilion, with hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing the king. The ob&s;curity added much to the horror of the &s;cene; and the Per&s;ians, incapable of di&s;tingui&s;hing friend from foe, fell furiou&s;ly upon each other, and rather a&s;&s;i&s;ted than oppo&s;ed the Greeks. Thus &s;uc|ce&s;s &s;eemed to crown the ra&s;hne&s;s of their enter|prize, until the morning beginning to dawn, the light &s;oon di&s;covered the &s;mallne&s;s of their numbers. They were &s;oon, therefore, &s;urrounded by the Per|&s;ian forces, who fearing to fall in upon them, flung their javelins from every quarter, till the Greeks, not &s;o much conquered, as tired with conquering, fell amid&s;t heaps of the &s;laughtered enemy, leaving be|hind them an example of courage, to which there is no parallel to be found in hi&s;tory. Leonidas was one of the fir&s;t that fell; and the endeavours of the Lacedaemonians to defend his dead body were in|credible. It was found, after the battle, buried un|der a mountain of the dead, and was nailed to a cro&s;s, by way of infamy, by the brutal victor. Of all the train two only e&s;caped, who&s;e names were Ari&s;todemus and Panites. The latter was treated with &s;uch contempt on his return to Sparta, that he killed him&s;elf in de&s;pair. Ari&s;todemus recovered his lo&s;t honour by his gallant behaviour at the battle of Plataea. The lo&s;s of the Per&s;ians on this occa&s;ion is &s;uppo&s;ed to have amounted to twenty thou&s;and men, among which were two of the king's brothers.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="51">The very day on which the battle of Thermo|pylae was fought, there was a naval engagement be|tween the fleets of Greece and Per&s;ia, in which the former took or &s;unk thirty of the enemy's &s;hips, and forced a hundred and &s;eventy of them to &s;ea, where, by &s;tre&s;s of weather, they were all &s;oon after either &s;unk or &s;tranded.</P>
<P>Xerxes, however, having now pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traits, found nothing capable of oppo&s;ing his progre&s;s in the open country, and he therefore directed his march towards Athens, on which he was determined to take a &s;ignal vengeance. Themi&s;tocles, &s;eeing the impo&s;&s;ibility of defending this place, u&s;ed all his eloquence and addre&s;s in per&s;uading his countrymen to abandon it for the pre&s;ent; and this he was at la&s;t able, though with no little difficulty, to effect. A decree was therefore pa&s;&s;ed, by which it was or|dained, that Athens for awhile &s;hould be given up in tru&s;t to the Gods, and that all the inhabitants, whether in freedom or &s;lavery, &s;hould go on board the fleet. The young and adventurous &s;et &s;ail for Salamis; the old, the women, and children took &s;helter at Trezene, the inhabitants of which gene|rou&s;ly offered them an a&s;ylum. But in this general de&s;ertion of the city, that which rai&s;ed the com|pa&s;&s;ion of all was, the great number of old men they were obliged to leave in the place, on account of their age and infirmities. Many al&s;o voluntarily remained behind, believing that the citadel, which they had fortified with wooden walls, was what the oracle pointed out for general &s;afety. To heighten this &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, the matrons were &s;een cling|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng with fond affection to the places where they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o long re&s;ided; the women filled the &s;treets with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">amentations, and even the poor dome&s;tic animals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eemed to take a part in the general concern. It was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the&s;e poor creatures run howl|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng and crying after their ma&s;ters, who were going
<PB N="42" REF="52">
on &s;hipboard, without being &s;trongly affected. Among the&s;e the faithfulne&s;s of a particular dog is recorded, who jumped into the &s;ea after his ma&s;ter, and continued &s;wimming as near as he could to the ve&s;&s;el, till he landed at Salamis, and died the mo|ment after upon the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e few inhabitants that remained behind re|tired into the citadel, where, literally interpreting the oracle, they fortified it as well as they could, and patiently awaited the approach of the invader. Nor was it long before they &s;aw him arrive at their gates, and &s;ummon them to &s;urrender. This, how|ever, they refu&s;ed to do, or even to li&s;ten to any terms he propo&s;ed to them. The place was there|fore taken by a&s;&s;ault; all who were found in it were put to the &s;word, and the citadel was reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>But though the confederates had been thus obliged to abandon Athens to the fury of the enemy, they were by no means di&s;po&s;ed to let them over-run the whole country. They took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Peloponne|&s;us, built a wall acro&s;s the i&s;thmus that joined it to the continent, and committed the defence of that important po&s;t to Cleombrotus, the brother of Leonidas. In adopting this mea&s;ure they were all of them unanimous, as being the mo&s;t prudent that could be embraced. The ca&s;e was not the &s;ame with regard to the operations of the fleet. Eury|biades was for bringing it into the neighbourhood of the i&s;thmus, that &s;o the &s;ea and land forces might act in conjunction. Themi&s;tocles was of a quite different opinion, and maintained, that it would be the height of folly to abandon &s;o advantageous a po&s;t as that of Salamis, where they were now &s;ta|tioned. They were now, he &s;aid, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the narrow &s;eas, where the number of the enemy's &s;hips could never avail them; that the only hope now left the Athenians was their fleet, and that
<PB N="43" REF="53">
this mu&s;t not capriciou&s;ly be given up by ignorance to the enemy. Eurybiades, who con&s;idered him|&s;elf as glanced at, could not contain his re&s;entment, but was going to &s;trike Themi&s;tocles for his in&s;o|lence. <Q REND="inline">"Strike me," cried the Athenian, "&s;trike me, but hear me."</Q> His moderation, and his rea|&s;oning prevailed; and it was therefore re&s;olved to await the enemy's fleet at Salamis. Fearful, how|ever, that the confederates might change their mind, Themi&s;tocles had recour&s;e to one of tho&s;e &s;trata|gems which mark &s;uperior genius. He contrived to have it privately intimated to Xerxes that the confederates were now a&s;&s;embled at Salamis, pre|paring for flight, and that it would be an ea&s;y mat|ter to attack and de&s;troy them. The artifice &s;uc|ceeded. Xerxes gave orders to his fleet to block up Salamis by night, in order to prevent an e&s;cape, that would have baffled his views of vengeance.</P>
<P>Even Themi&s;tocles him&s;elf was not &s;en&s;ible, for &s;ome time, of the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;cheme, and of his &s;eemingly dangerous &s;ituation. Ari&s;tides, who then commanded a &s;mall body of troops at Egina, no &s;ooner heard it, than, ignorant of the real cau&s;e of all the&s;e manoeuvres, and actually thinking Themi&s;|tocles in danger, he ventured in a &s;mall boat by night through the whole fleet of the enemy. Upon landing he made up to the tent of Themi&s;tocles, and addre&s;&s;ed him in the following manner: <Q REND="inline">"If we are wi&s;e, Themi&s;tocles, we &s;hall henceforth lay a&s;ide all tho&s;e frivolous and puerile di&s;&s;en&s;ions which have hitherto divided us. One &s;trife, and a noble one it is, now remains for us, which of us &s;hall be mo&s;t &s;erviceable to our country. It is your's to command as a general; it is mine to obey as a &s;ubject; and happy &s;hall I be, if my advice can any way contri|bute to your and my country's glory."</Q> He then informed him of the fleet's real &s;ituation, and warm|ly exhorted him to give battle without delay.
<PB N="44" REF="54">
Themi&s;tocles felt all that gratitude, which &s;o ge|nerous and di&s;intere&s;ted a conduct de&s;erved; and eager to make a proper return, he immediately let him into all his &s;chemes and projects, particularly this la&s;t, of &s;uffering him&s;elf to be blocked up. After this they exerted their joint influence with the other commanders to per&s;uade them to engage; and accordingly both fleets prepared them&s;elves for battle.</P>
<P>The Grecian fleet con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred and eighty &s;hips, the Per&s;ian fleet was much more nu|merous. But whatever advantage they had in numbers, and the &s;ize of their &s;hips, they fell in|finitely &s;hort of the Greeks in their naval &s;kill, and their acquaintance with the &s;eas where they fought; but it was chiefly on the &s;uperior abilities of their commanders that the Greeks placed their hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. Eurybiades had nominally the command of the fleet, but Themi&s;tocles directed all its operations. He knowing that a periodical wind, which would be favourable, would &s;oon &s;et in, de|layed the attack till that time; and this had no &s;ooner ari&s;en, than the &s;ignal was given for battle, and the Grecian fleet &s;ailed forward in exact order.</P>
<P>As the Per&s;ians now fought under the eye of their &s;overeign, who beheld the action from a neighbour|ing promontory, they exerted them&s;elves for &s;ome time with great &s;pirit; but their courage abated when they came to a clo&s;er engagement. The nu|merous di&s;advantages of their circum&s;tances and &s;i|tuation then began to appear. The wind blew direct|ly in their faces; the height and heavine&s;s of their ve&s;&s;els rendered them unwieldy and u&s;ele&s;s; and even the number of their &s;hips in the narrow &s;ea only &s;erved to embarra&s;s and perplex them. The Ionians were the fir&s;t that fled; the Phoenicians and Cyprians were &s;oon after driven on &s;hore; and
<PB N="45" REF="55">
in a little time their whole fleet was thrown into confu&s;ion. In the general con&s;ternation which this occa&s;ioned, Artemi&s;ia, queen of Halicarna&s;&s;us, who had come to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Xerxes with five &s;hips, exerted her&s;elf with &s;o much &s;pirit, that that mo|narch was heard to &s;ay, that his &s;oldiers behaved like women in the conflict, and the women like &s;oldiers. Nothing, however, could repair the di&s;order that had now taken place in the Per&s;ian fleet. They in&s;tantly fled on all &s;ides; &s;ome of them were &s;unk, and more taken; above two hundred were burnt, and all the re&s;t were entirely di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>Such was the i&s;&s;ue of the battle of Salamis, in which the Per&s;ians received a more &s;evere blow than any they had hitherto experienced from Greece. Themi&s;tocles is &s;aid to have been &s;o elated with this victory, that he propo&s;ed breaking down the bridge on the Helle&s;pont, and thus cutting off the retreat of the enemy; but from this he was di&s;&s;uaded by Ari&s;tides, who repre&s;ented the great danger of re|ducing &s;o powerful an army to de&s;pair. Xerxes, however, &s;eems to have been &s;o apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome &s;uch &s;tep being taken, that, after leaving about three hundred thou&s;and of his be&s;t troops behind him under Mardonius, not &s;o much with a view of conquering Greece, as in order to prevent a pur&s;uit, he ha&s;tened back with the re&s;t to the Helle&s;pont, where finding the bridge broken down by the vio|lence of the waves, he was obliged to pa&s;s over in a &s;mall boat; and this manner of leaving Europe, when compared to his o&s;tentatious method of enter|ing it, rendered his di&s;grace the more poignant and afflicting.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. FROM THE RETREAT OF XERXES OUT OF GREECE, TO THE BATTLE OF MYCALE.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3524.</NOTE>NOTHING could exceed the joy of the Greeks upon the victory they had obtained at Salamis. It was a cu&s;tom among them, after a battle, for the commanding officers to declare who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves mo&s;t, by writing the names of &s;uch as merited the fir&s;t and &s;econd rewards. On this occa&s;ion, each officer concerned adjudged the fir&s;t rank to him&s;elf, but all allowed the &s;econd to Themi&s;tocles, which was in fact allowing him a tacit &s;uperiority. This was farther confirmed by the Lacedaemonians, who carried him in triumph to Sparta; and who having adjudged the reward of valour to their own countryman, Eurybiades, adjudged that of wi&s;dom to Themi&s;tocles. They crowned him with olive, pre&s;ented him with a rich chariot, and conducted him with three hundred hor&s;e to the confines of their &s;tate. But there was an homage paid him that flattered his pride yet more; when he appeared at the Olympic games, that is before all the &s;tates of Greece a&s;&s;embled, the &s;pectators received him with uncommon acclamations. As &s;oon as he appeared the whole a&s;&s;embly ro&s;e up to do him honour; no|body regarded either the games or the combatants; Themi&s;tocles was the only object worth their at|tention. Struck with &s;uch flattering honours, he could not help crying out, that he that day reaped the fruits of all his labours.</P>
<P>Mardonius, having pa&s;&s;ed the winter in The&s;&s;aly, led his forces in the &s;pring into the province of Boeotia, and from thence &s;ent Alexander, king of
<PB N="47" REF="57">
Macedonia, with very tempting propo&s;als to the Athenians, hoping by that means to detach them from the general intere&s;ts of Greece. He offered to rebuild their city, to pre&s;ent them with a con&s;i|derable &s;um of money, to allow them to enjoy their laws and liberties, and to be&s;tow upon them the government of all Greece. The Spartans were afraid that the Athenians might be apt to accept of the&s;e propo&s;als, and they therefore &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Athens, in order to di&s;&s;uade them from &s;o ba&s;e a conduct. But Ari&s;tides, who was then chief Ar|chon of Athens, needed no other monitor than the dictates of his own heart. Receiving Alexander and the amba&s;&s;adors at the &s;ame time, he addre&s;&s;ed them in the following terms: <Q REND="inline">"For men," &s;aid he, "bred up in plea&s;ure and ignorance, it is natu|ral to proffer great rewards, and to hope by bribes to undermine virtue.

They propo&s;ed to fortify the i&s;thmus of Peloponne&s;us. But the Athenians remon&s;trating again&s;t &s;o partial and ungenerous a proceeding, the Spartans readily gave up the point.</P>
<P>The Grecian army was now a&s;&s;embled to the number of &s;eventy thou&s;and men. Of the&s;e five thou&s;and were Spartans, attended by thirty-five thou|&s;and Helots. The Athenians amounted to eight thou&s;and, and the troops of the allies made up the re&s;t. With this army the Greeks re&s;olved to oppo&s;e Mardonius, though at the head of no le&s;s than three hundred thou&s;and men. That general, fearing to be attacked in the hilly country of Attica, where he could not avail him&s;elf of his great &s;uperiority of numbers, had lately returned into Boeotia, and en|camped his troops on the banks of the river A&s;opus. Thither he was pur&s;ued by the Grecians; but as nei|ther &s;ide could begin the attack without encounter|ing great di&s;advantages, the two armies continued in &s;ight of each other for the &s;pace of ten days, both of them equally eager for a battle, and yet both afraid to &s;trike the fir&s;t blow.</P>
<P>It was during this interval that a mutiny had like to have ari&s;en in the Grecian army about the po&s;t of honour. All parties allowed the Spartans

and immoveable to all the a&s;&s;aults of the enemy. At the &s;ame time, the Athenians being in|formed of the attack, quickly turned back, and, after defeating a body of Greeks in Per&s;ian pay, they came to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spartans, ju&s;t as the&s;e la&s;t had completed the overthrow of the enemy. For Mardonius, enraged at &s;eeing his men give way, ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t of the ranks, in order to re&s;tore the battle; and while he was doing &s;o, he was killed by Aimne&s;tus, a Spartan. Upon this the whole army betook them&s;elves to flight. Artabazis, with a body of forty thou&s;and men, fled towards the Helle&s;pont; the re&s;t retreated to their camp, and there endeavoured to defend them&s;elves with wooden ramparts. But the&s;e being quickly broken down, the confederates ru&s;hed in upon them with irre&s;i&s;tible fury; and eager to rid their coun|try of &s;uch terrible invaders, they &s;ternly refu&s;ed them all quarter, and put upwards of a hundred thou&s;and of them to the &s;word. Thus ended the inva&s;ion of the Per&s;ians into Greece; nor ever after was an army from Per&s;ia &s;een to cro&s;s the Helle|&s;pont. We have already ob&s;erved, that Ari&s;tides commanded the Athenians in this important action. The Spartans were headed by Cleombrotus, and Pau&s;anias, a Lacedaemonian, was the chief com|mander.</P>
<P>The battle was no &s;ooner over, than the Greeks, to te&s;tify their gratitude to heaven, cau&s;ed a &s;tatue of Jupiter to be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the public expence, and placed it in his t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mple at Olympia.

on which the victory at Plataea was won, another, equally glorious, was obtained at Mycale on the coa&s;t of Ionia. After the defeat at Salamis, the re|mains of the Per&s;ian fleet retired to Samos; but the Greeks were not long in pur&s;uing them. The con|federates, on this occa&s;ion, were headed by Leo|cychides, the Spartan, and Xanthippus, the Athenian.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. FROM THE VICTORY AT MYCALE, TO THE PEACE CONCLUDED BETWEEN THE GREEKS AND PERSIANS.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3526.</NOTE>NO &s;ooner were the Greeks freed from the apprehen&s;ions of a fo|reign foe, than they began to entertain jealou&s;ies of each other; and the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of this dange|rous &s;pirit appeared in a mi&s;under&s;tanding that took place between the Athenians and Spartans. The former, with their families, being returned to their own country, began to think of rebuilding the city; and as its late &s;tate of weakne&s;s had rendered it &s;o ea&s;y a prey to the Per&s;ians, they now formed a plan for &s;trengthening and extending the walls, and giv|ing it, for the future, a greater degree of &s;ecurity. This excited the jealou&s;y of the Lacedaemonians, who could not bear to &s;ee any of the other &s;tates of Greece upon an equal footing with them&s;elves. They therefore &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to di&s;&s;uade the Athenians from this undertaking; but being a&s;hamed to avow thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> real motive, they alledged the great detriment which the&s;e fortifications would be of to the general intere&s;ts of Greece, if ever they &s;hould fall into the hands of the enemy. Themi&s;tocles, who then guided all the councils of Athens, at once &s;aw through their de&s;ign, and re&s;olved to meet their duplicity with equal di&s;&s;imulation. He therefore told them that the Athenians would &s;oon &s;end an emba&s;&s;y to Sparta, and fully &s;atisfy all their &s;cruples; and having procured him&s;elf to be cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e, he accordingly went thither, and by &s;tu|died delays kept the Spartans in &s;u&s;pence until the works were completely fini&s;hed. He then boldly
<PB N="53" REF="63">
threw off the ma&s;k, and declared that Athens was now in a condition to keep out any enemy, either foreign or dome&s;tic; and that what &s;he had done was perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the laws of nations, and the common intere&s;ts of Greece. He further added, that if any violence were offered to his per|&s;on, the Athenians would retaliate upon the Spartan amba&s;&s;adors, who were now in their hands; in con|&s;equence of which the amba&s;&s;adors on both &s;ides were &s;uffered quietly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> depart, and Themi&s;tocles, upon his arrival in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">ns, was received as if he had been returning from a triumph.</P>
<P>Encouraged by his &s;ucce&s;s in this undertaking, Themi&s;tocles projected another &s;cheme, far le&s;s ju&s;|tifiable indeed, for increa&s;ing the power and impor|tance of his country. This &s;cheme, however, he declared in a full a&s;&s;embly of the people, would not admit of being publicly mentioned, as its execution required &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch. He therefore begged that &s;ome per&s;on might be appointed, to whom he might communicate his de&s;ign, one who was quali|fied to judge at once of the utility and the practi|cability of the project. Ari&s;tides was pitched upon for this purpo&s;e. To him Themi&s;tocles privately &s;ignified his intention of burning the fleet belonging to the re&s;t of the Grecian &s;tates, which then lay in a neighbouring port, and thus rendering Athens the undi&s;puted &s;overeign of the &s;ea. Ari&s;tides, &s;hocked at &s;o ba&s;e a propo&s;al, made no an&s;wer, but returning to the a&s;&s;embly, informed them, that nothing could be more advantageous to Athens than what The|mi&s;tocles propo&s;ed, but that nothing, at the &s;ame time, could be more unju&s;t. The people, adopting the magnanimous &s;entiments of their magi&s;trate, unanimou&s;ly rejected the propo&s;al, without knowing its contents, and be&s;towed upon Ari&s;tides the &s;ur|name of <HI>Ju&s;t,</HI> which he &s;o well de&s;erved.</P>
<P>The confederates being thus left at liberty to turn their arms again&s;t their foreign foes, in&s;tead of

drawing their &s;words again&s;t one another, fitted out a powerful fleet. Pau&s;anias commanded the Spar|tans; the Athenians were conducted by Ari&s;tides and Cimon, the &s;on of Miltiades. They fir&s;t di|rected their cour&s;e to the i&s;le of Cyprus, where they &s;et all the cities free. Then &s;teering towards the Helle&s;pont, they attacked the city of Byzantium, of which they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters; and, be&s;ides the va&s;t quantity of plunder which they found in it, they took a great number of pri&s;oners, many of whom were of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable fami|lies of Per&s;ia.</P>
<P>But whatever the Greeks gained upon this occa|&s;ion in fame and authority, they lo&s;t in the purity and &s;implicity of their manners. The deluge of wealth poured in upon them from this quarter, naturally tended to corrupt their morals; and from this time forward, neither the magi&s;trates nor the people valued them&s;elves, as formerly, on their per|&s;onal merit, but merely on account of their riches and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The Athenians, being a polite people, bore this change for &s;ome time with tolera|ble moderation; but the contagion&punc; immediately broke out among the Spartans with all its native virulence. It &s;eems to have in&s;pired Pau&s;anias, who was naturally of a haughty and imperious temper, and who had forfeited the good opinion not only of the neighbouring &s;tates, but al&s;o of his own &s;ubjects, with the ambitious hopes of rai&s;ing him&s;elf to a &s;till higher rank than he had yet attained. He offered to deliver up Sparta, and even all Greece, to Xerxes, provided that prince would give him his daughter in marriage. How long this con&s;piracy was carried on is uncertain. Pau&s;anias was twice t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied, and twice acquitted for want of &s;ufficient evi|dence again&s;t him. His guilt, however, became at length too apparent to be any longer concealed; but ju&s;t as the Ephon were upon the point of &s;eizing
<PB N="55" REF="65">
him, he took refuge in the temple of Minerva, where the &s;anctity of the place preventing his being dragged forth, the people blocked up the entry with large &s;tones, and tearing off the roof, left him in that manner to die of cold and hunger. This he in a little time did; and thus peri&s;hed the man who had led on the victorious troops of Greece in the battle of Plataea.</P>
<P>The fate of Pau&s;anias &s;oon after involved that of Themi&s;tocles, who had &s;ome time before been ba|ni&s;hed, and lived in great e&s;teem at Argos. The occa&s;ion of his bani&s;hment was this. He had built near his hou&s;e a temple in honour of Diana, with this in&s;cription, <Q REND="inline">"To Diana, the godde&s;s of good coun&s;el;"</Q> thereby in&s;inuating the benefit his own coun&s;els had been of to his country, and the little gratitude his fellow-citizens had &s;hewn in rewarding them. He was now accu&s;ed, not only of having been privy to the de&s;igns of Pau&s;anias, without re|vealing them to the &s;tate, which part of the charge indeed &s;eems to have been well founded, but like|wi&s;e of having approved and favoured tho&s;e de|&s;igns, a crime, it would appear, of which he was altogether guiltle&s;s. The Spartans, however, who had always been his enemies, now declared them|&s;elves his accu&s;ers before the a&s;&s;embly of the people of Athens; and all tho&s;e of his countrymen, who had formerly either dreaded his power, or envied his popularity, joined in the general charge again&s;t him. In a word, the people were wrought up to &s;uch a degree of rage, that they clamoured for his death with great vehemence; and per&s;ons were actually &s;ent to &s;eize and bring him before the general coun|cil of Greece. Fortunately, however, he had no|tice of their de&s;ign, and &s;aved him&s;elf by a precipi|tate flight. He fir&s;t took refuge in the i&s;land of Corcyra. From thence he repaired to the court of Admetus, king of the Molo&s;&s;ians; but that prince
<PB N="56" REF="66">
not being able to afford him any long or certain protection, he at la&s;t went over to Sardis, where, throwing him&s;elf pro&s;trate before the Per&s;ian mo|narch, he boldly declared his name, his country, and his misfortunes. <Q REND="inline">"I have done," cried he, "my ungrateful country &s;ervices more than once, and I am now come to offer tho&s;e &s;ervices to you. My life is in your hands: you may now exert your clemency, or di&s;play your vengeance. By the for|mer you will pre&s;erve a faithful &s;uppliant; by the latter you will de&s;troy the greate&s;t enemy of Greece."</Q> The king made him no an&s;wer at this audience, though he was &s;truck with admiration at his elo|quence and intrepidity; but he &s;oon gave a loo&s;e to his joy for the event. He told his courtiers, that he con&s;idered the arrival of Themi&s;tocles as a very happy incident, and wi&s;hed that his enemies would always pur&s;ue the &s;ame de&s;tructive policy of bani&s;h|ing from among them the good and wi&s;e. His joys were continued in a dream. In the night he was &s;een to &s;tart from his &s;leep, and three times to cry out, <Q REND="inline">"I have got Themi&s;tocles the Athenian."</Q> He even gave him three cities for his &s;upport, and had him maintained in the utmo&s;t affluence and &s;plendor. It is &s;aid, that &s;uch was his intere&s;t at the Per&s;ian court, and &s;o great was the e&s;timation in which he was held by all ranks of people, that one day at table he was heard to cry out to his wife and children, who &s;at near him, <Q REND="inline">"Children, we &s;hould certainly have been ruined, if we had not formerly been undone."</Q></P>
<P>But nothing could eraze from the brea&s;t of The|mi&s;tocles the love he entertained for his country. Indeed, the &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m appears to have pre|vailed among the Greeks in a higher degree than ever it did among any other people. This was no doubt owing to the many violent &s;truggles they had been obliged to make in defence of their country.
<PB N="57" REF="67">
And perhaps it will be found, that the value we &s;et upon any thing, is always in proportion to the pains we have taken in acquiring or pre&s;erving it. When Xerxes, therefore, propo&s;ed fitting out an expedi|tion again&s;t Athens, and entru&s;ting the command of it to Themi&s;tocles, that patriot, rather than carry arms again&s;t the place of his nativity, put an end to his own life by poi&s;on.</P>
<P>In the mean time Ari&s;tides, in&s;tead of incurring the jealou&s;y of his countrymen by his ambitious and intere&s;ted views, continued every day to acquire a larger &s;hare of their e&s;teem and veneration by his integrity and love of ju&s;tice. So great, indeed, was his character in this re&s;pect, that when it was deliberated among the &s;tates of Greece who was the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to be intru&s;ted with the care of the public trea&s;ure for carrying on the war, all eyes were fixed upon him as the mo&s;t upright man to be found in the country; and his di&s;charge of this important office, to which he was immediately ap|pointed, only &s;erved to confirm the high opinion the world already entertained of him. His merit, be&s;ides, in this particular was &s;o much the greater, as he him&s;elf was extremely poor; but it appeared from the following incident that he was voluntarily poor, and might have been richer, if he had cho&s;en it. Callias, an intimate friend and relation of his, being &s;ummoned before the judges for &s;ome offence, one of the chief objections urged again&s;t him was, that while he rolled in affluence and luxury, he &s;uf|fered his friend and relation, Ari&s;tides, to remain in poverty and want. But Callias appealing to Ari&s;ti|des him&s;elf, it appeared that he had generou&s;ly offer|ed to &s;hare his fortune with him, which the other had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to accept; a&s;&s;erting, that he only might be &s;aid to want, who permitted his ap|petites to tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of his income; and that he who could di&s;pen&s;e with a few things,
<PB N="58" REF="68">
thus rendered him&s;elf more like the gods, that want for nothing.</P>
<P>In this manner he lived, ju&s;t in his public, and independent in his private capacity, and univer&s;ally e&s;teemed and beloved by all that knew him. Hi&s;|tory does not acquaint us with the time or place of his death; but it bears the mo&s;t glorious te&s;ti|mony to his character, in telling us that he who had had the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of the public trea&s;ures, died poor. It is even a&s;&s;erted, that he did not leave money enough behind him to defray the expence of his funeral, but that the government was obliged to bear the charge of it, and to maintain his family. His daughters were portioned, and his &s;on &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at the expence of the public; and &s;ome of his grand|children were &s;upported by a pen&s;ion equal to that be&s;towed upon tho&s;e who had been victorious at the Olympic games.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t man that began to make a figure at Athens after the death of Themi&s;tocles and Ari&s;tides, was Cimon, the &s;on or Miltiades. In his earlier years he had led a very di&s;&s;olute life; but Ari&s;tides perceiving in him, amid&s;t all his di&s;&s;ipation, the &s;eeds of many great and good qualities, advi&s;ed him to change his conduct, and to rai&s;e his mind, from the pur&s;uit of low and ignoble plea&s;ures, to the ambition of directing the affairs of the &s;tate. He did &s;o, and, in a little time, became equal to his father in courage, to Themi&s;tocles in &s;agacity, and even not much inferior to his in&s;tructor him&s;elf in integrity. The fir&s;t &s;pecimen he gave of his mili|tary talents was in &s;couring the A&s;iatic &s;eas, and delivering all the Greek cities on the coa&s;ts of A&s;ia Minor from their dependence upon the Per&s;ian crown, and making them join in the general confe|deracy of Greece again&s;t that very power to which they had formerly acknowledged allegiance. Some of the&s;e, however, that were &s;trongly garri&s;oned by
<PB N="59" REF="69">
Per&s;ian troops, made a de&s;perate defence. The city of Eion de&s;erves to be particularly mentioned. Boges, the governor, re&s;olved either to pre&s;erve it, or to peri&s;h in the attempt. He accordingly de|fended the place with incredible fury, till finding his &s;tation no longer tenable, he killed his wife and children, and laying them on a funeral pile, which he had erected for the purpo&s;e, he immediately &s;et it on fire, and ru&s;hing into the mid&s;t of the flames, in that manner expired.</P>
<P>While Cimon was employed in the&s;e operations, he received intelligence that the whole Per&s;ian fleet was anchored at the mouth of the river Eurymidon. He accordingly &s;ailed thither, and pur&s;uing the ene|my up the &s;tream, where they endeavoured to take &s;helter, he de&s;troyed all their &s;hips; and his men, jumping on &s;hore in pur&s;uit of the Per&s;ian mariners, who had abandonded their ve&s;&s;els, they &s;oon put them to flight, thus obtaining a complete victory both by &s;ea and land on the &s;ame occa&s;ion. This &s;evere blow at la&s;t compelled the Per&s;ians to agree to a peace, the terms of which were as mortifying to them, as they were honourable to the Grecians. It was &s;tipulated that the Greek cities in A&s;ia &s;hould be left in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their liberty, and that neither the &s;ea nor land forces of Per&s;ia &s;hould approach &s;o near the Grecian coa&s;ts, as to give the lea&s;t occa&s;ion for any kind of jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>The trea&s;ures taken in this expedition Cimon laid out in beautifying his native city; and the Athenians gave examples in the art of architecture, that con|tinue to be admired to this very day. About the &s;ame time lived the poet Simonides, &s;ome of who&s;e works &s;till remain; and the&s;e only leave us room to regret that the re&s;t are long &s;ince irretrievably lo&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. FROM THE PEACE WITH PERSIA, TO THE PEACE OF NICIAS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Cimon was for &s;ome time, after the death of Ari&s;tides, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable man at Athens, he did not remain long without a rival. He was &s;oon oppo&s;ed by Pericles, who was much younger than he, and was a man of a very different character. Pericles was de&s;cended from the great|e&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;trious families of Athens: his fa|ther, Xanthippus, defeated the Per&s;ians at Mycale; and his mother Agari&s;ta was niece to Cali&s;thenes, who expelled the tyrants, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a popular government in Athens. In the earlier part of his life he applied him&s;elf with &s;ucce&s;s to all the differ|ent branches of philo&s;ophy; but the chief bent of his mind was directed to the &s;tudy of eloquence, in which he is &s;aid to have out&s;hone all his contempo|raries. Even his great opponent, Thucydides, was often heard to &s;ay, that though he had frequently overthrown him, the power of his eloquence was &s;uch, that the audience could never perceive him fallen. He re&s;embled the tyrant Pi&s;i&s;tratus, not only in the &s;weetne&s;s of his voice, but the features of his face, and his whole air and manner. To the&s;e na|tural and acquired endowments he added tho&s;e of fortune; he was very rich, and intimately connect|ed with all the mo&s;t powerful families of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation of Cimon, however, was for &s;ome time a bar to the ri&s;e of Pericles; but as the former was generally abroad, commanding the fleets or armies of the country, and the latter was always at home, haranguing and making inte|re&s;t
<PB N="61" REF="71">
with the people, he &s;oon found means to over|come this ob&s;tacle. The fir&s;t u&s;e he made of his popu|larity was to le&s;&s;en the power, and con&s;equently the character of the court of Areopagus. This he did chiefly by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one Ephialtes, another popular leader, who contrived to take away the deci&s;ion of almo&s;t all cau&s;es from that celebrated tribunal, and to bring them before the a&s;&s;embly of the people. Cimon's intere&s;t, however, was &s;till able to counter|act, and even to overpower that of Pericles in a very important que&s;tion. This was whether the Athe|nians &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the Lacedaemonians in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing an in&s;urrection of their Helots, or &s;laves, who had taken up arms to re&s;cue them&s;elves from bondage. Cimon gave his opinion in the affirmative; Pericles in the negative. But Cimon's opinion, as being the mo&s;t generous, was for this time adopted, and he was allowed to conduct a large body of troops to Sparta, with which he effectually quelled the in&s;ur|rection. But the Helots taking up arms a &s;econd time, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Ithome, the Spartans were once more obliged to apply to Athens for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The influence, however, of Pericles now prevailed in its turn, and all kind of aid was denied them. Thus left to fini&s;h the war by them&s;elves, they be&s;ieged Ithome, which held out for ten years; at the end of which, how|ever, they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it, though they &s;pared the lives of tho&s;e who defended it, upon condition of their leaving Peloponne&s;us for ever.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Athenians upon this occa&s;ion, and &s;ome in&s;ults they pretended to have received from the Lacedaemonians, revived a jealou&s;y that had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the&s;e rival &s;tates, and which continued thenceforward to operate with greater or le&s;s influence, till both of them were re|duced to &s;uch a low ebb of power, that neither of them was able to with&s;tand the &s;lighte&s;t inva&s;ion
<PB N="62" REF="72">
from abroad. The fir&s;t in&s;tance the Athenians gave of their re&s;entment, was to bani&s;h Cimon, who had been a favourer of the Spartan cau&s;e, for ten years, from the city. They next di&s;&s;olved their alliance with Sparta, and entered into a treaty with the Argives, the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of the former. The &s;laves bani&s;hed from Peloponne&s;us were taken under the protection of Athens, and &s;ettled with their families at Naupactus: and all the privileges or Spartan &s;ubjects were demanded in behalf of tho&s;e Athenians that re&s;ided in Lacedaemon. But what contributed to widen the breach &s;till more, the city of Megara, breaking off its alliance with Sparta, was protected and garri&s;oned by the Athenians; and thus was laid the foundation of an inveterate hatred, that terminated in the de&s;truction of both the&s;e &s;tates.</P>
<P>The chief motive to this in&s;olent and treacherous conduct of the Athenians, was the high opinion they entertained of them&s;elves ever &s;ince the battle of Plataea. That victory had rai&s;ed them to the &s;ame national eminence with the Lacedaemonians. But they were nor &s;atisfied with being their equals; they wanted to be their &s;uperiors. They, there|fore, called them&s;elves the <HI>Protectors of Greece</HI>; they de&s;ired that the convention of the &s;tates &s;hould be held at Athens, and they re&s;olved to declare open war again&s;t any power that &s;hould dare to in&s;ult them.</P>
<P>Exa&s;perated, however, as the&s;e two &s;tates were again&s;t each other, they did not immediately come to rupture. They fir&s;t endeavoured to &s;trengthen them&s;elves by leagues and alliances with the neigh|bouring &s;tates. At la&s;t the armies of the two re|publics came to an engagement near Tangara; and though Cimon, forgetting the injury he had receiv|ed fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m his country, came to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet the Athenians &s;uffered a defeat. A month or two after
<PB N="63" REF="73">
another action happened, and the Athenians were, in their turn, victorious. The conduct of Cimon upon this occa&s;ion re-e&s;tabli&s;hed him in the public favour; he was re&s;tored to his country, after a ba|ni&s;hment of five years; and his rival Pericles was the fir&s;t that propo&s;ed the decree for his recall.</P>
<P>Cimon's fir&s;t care, after his return, was to com|promi&s;e all differences between the rival &s;tates; and this was &s;o far outwardly effected, that a truce was concluded for the &s;pace of five years. This furni&s;h|ed an opportunity for exerting the power of the &s;tate upon a more di&s;tant enemy. A fleet of two hundred &s;ail was fitted out, and the command of it given to Cimon, for conquering the i&s;land of Cyprus. He accordingly &s;ailed thither, over-ran the i&s;land, and laid &s;iege to the capital, Citium. But being ei|ther wounded by &s;ome of the defendants, or wa&s;ted by &s;ickne&s;s, he began to perceive the approaches of death. Still mindful, however, of his duty, he or|dered his attendants to conceal his decea&s;e till their &s;chemes were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. They did &s;o; and thirty days after he was dead, the army, which &s;till &s;uppo&s;ed it&s;elf under his command, obliged the place to &s;urrender. Thus he not only died in the arms of victory, but he even gained battles by the terror of his name. In &s;o great awe, indeed, did the Per&s;ians &s;tand of him, that they univer&s;ally de|&s;erted the &s;ea-coa&s;ts, and would not come within four hundred leagues of any place where he could po&s;&s;ibly be expected.</P>
<P>Pericles being now freed from the oppo&s;ition of &s;o powerful a rival, re&s;olved to complete the work of ambition he had begun; and by dividing the con|quered lands among the people, amu&s;ing them with &s;hows, and adorning the city with public buildings, be at la&s;t acquired &s;uch an a&s;cendancy over the minds of the populace, that he may actually be &s;aid to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;overeign power in a free &s;tate.
<PB N="64" REF="74">
The buildings, indeed, which he rai&s;ed, have en|deared his memory to all the lovers of the fine arts. Some &s;mall remains of them are &s;till to be &s;een; and the&s;e are allowed by the be&s;t judges to be &s;o perfect in their kind, that they have never &s;ince been excelled, and hardly ever equalled. True it is, that, to complete the&s;e works, he was guilty, in &s;ome mea&s;ure of inju&s;tice; for he applied to this pur|po&s;e part of the money that had been rai&s;ed by the different &s;tates of Greece for carrying on the war again&s;t Per&s;ia: but when any of the&s;e &s;tates com|plained of this embezzlement of the public trea&s;ure, Pericles boldly replied, that the Athenians were not accountable to any for their conduct, and that they had the be&s;t right to the trea&s;ures of the confederate &s;tates, who took the greate&s;t care to defend them. He added, that it was fit that ingenious artizans &s;hould have their &s;hare of the public money, &s;ince there was &s;till enough left for carrying on the war.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, however, were by no means &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the other &s;tates of Greece, and lea&s;t of all the Spartans, who beheld the pre&s;ent pro&s;perity of Athens with envy, and the in&s;olence of Pericles with indignation. And the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were &s;till further inflamed by an expedition which the Athenians undertook again&s;t Samos, in favour of the Mile&s;ians, who had craved their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is &s;aid, that Pericles fomented this war, to plea&s;e a famous courtezan named A&s;pa&s;ia, of whom he was particularly enamoured. After &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes not worth mentioning, Pericles be&s;ieged the capi|tal of Samos with tortoi&s;es and battering rams, which was the fir&s;t time the&s;e military engines had been employed in &s;ieges. The Samians, after &s;u&s;|taining a nine months &s;iege, &s;urrendered. Pericles razed their walls, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of their &s;hips, and exacted immen&s;e &s;ums for defraying the expences
<PB N="65" REF="75">
of the war. Elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, he returned to Athens, buried all tho&s;e who had fallen in the mo&s;t &s;plendid manner, and pronounced their funeral oration.</P>
<P>Though the jealou&s;y and rival&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Athens and Sparta was the true cau&s;e of the Peloponne&s;ian war, yet neither of them was willing to avow their real motive; a petty quarrel among the inferior &s;tates of Greece, their allies, furni&s;hed them with an o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on. The Corcyreans, re&s;enting the conduct of the Corinthians with regard to one of their dependent colonies, named Epidamnus, took up arms to revenge the affront; but being wor&s;ted in &s;ome naval engage|ments, they had recour&s;e to the Athenians for &s;up|port, who &s;ent them &s;ome naval &s;uccours, which, however, were of no great &s;ervice. From this war aro&s;e another; for Potidaea, a city belonging to Athens, declaring for Corinth, the&s;e two &s;tates im|mediately came to a rupture, and drawing their forces into the field near Potidaea, a battle en&s;ued, in which the Athenians gained the victory. It was in this battle that Socrates &s;aved the life of Alcibia|des, his pupil; and after the battle was over, pro|cured him the prize of valour, which he him&s;elf more ju&s;tly de&s;erved. The city of Potidaea was &s;oon after be&s;ieged in con&s;equence of this victory, and the Corinthians complained to the &s;tates of Greece again&s;t the Athenians, as having infringed the arti|cles of peace. The Lacedaemonians gave them an audience, and after hearing what the Athenians had to urge in reply, they came to a re&s;olution, that the Athenians were the aggre&s;&s;ors, and ought to be re|duced to a &s;en&s;e of their duty.</P>
<P>To give a colour of ju&s;tice, however, to their pro|ceedings, they began by &s;ending amba&s;&s;adors to Athens; and while they made preparations for act|ing with vigour, they &s;till kept up a &s;hew of &s;eek|ing

redre&s;s by treaty.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 3572.</NOTE>A war between the two principal &s;tates of Greece, naturally drew all the inferior ones into the quarrel; and the&s;e cho&s;e their party, as intere&s;t, inclination, or ideas of ju&s;|tice led them. The majority declared in favour of the Lacedaemonians, who were con&s;idered as the deliverers of Greece. On their &s;ide were ranged the Achaians, the inhabitants of Pellene excepted, the people of Megara, Locris, Boeotia, Phocis, Ambracia, Leucadia, and Anactorium. On the &s;ide of Athens were the people of Chios, Le&s;bos, Plataea, many of the i&s;lands, and &s;everal maritime tributary &s;tates, including tho&s;e of Thrace, Potidaea excepted.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians were not long in taking the field. Their army, including their allies, amounted to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, and was commanded by Archidamus, one of their kings. The forces of the Athenians were not near &s;o numerous. The&s;e did not exceed thirteen thou&s;and heavy-armed &s;oldiers, &s;ixteen thou&s;and inhabitants, twelve hundred hor&s;e, and about double that number of archers. Unable, therefore, to meet the enemy in the field, Pericles advi&s;ed them to &s;hut them&s;elves up in the city, which could not ea&s;ily be &s;tormed. This advice at fir&s;t was but very ill reli&s;hed; but at la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity compelled them to adopt it. Removing, therefore, all their valuable effects out of the open country, which they abandoned to the mercy of the enemy, they took refuge within their walls, where they &s;eemed determined to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t extremity. To compen&s;ate, however, for the weakne&s;s of the land army, they had a great &s;upe|riority
<PB N="68" REF="78">
over the Spartans in their naval force. This con&s;i&s;ted of three hundred &s;hips, and with the&s;e they continually infe&s;ted and plundered the enemy's coa&s;ts, and rai&s;ed contributions &s;ufficient for defray|ing the expences of the war.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Lacedaemonians entered the country of Attica at Oenone, and meeting with no oppo&s;ition, marched forward to Acharne, within &s;even miles of Athens. The Athenians, enraged at the mortification to which they were now expo&s;ed, turned the edge of their re&s;entment from the enemy, and directed it again&s;t Pericles, whom they regarded as the author of their di&s;grace. They, therefore, in&s;i&s;ted upon being led out into the open field, where, notwith&s;tanding the inferiority of their numbers, they &s;aid they would boldly face the enemy. But Pericles cho&s;e the wi&s;er part. He &s;hut up the city gates, placed &s;ufficient guards at all the po&s;ts a|round, &s;ent out parties of hor&s;e to keep the enemy employed, and at the &s;ame time di&s;patched a fleet of an hundred &s;ail to infe&s;t the coa&s;ts of Peloponne&s;us. The&s;e expedients had the de&s;ired effect. The La|cedaemonians, finding the place to be altogether impregnable, gave up the &s;iege, after laying wa&s;te the country around, and in&s;ulting the defenders by their numbers and reproaches. To revenge this in|jury, the Athenians, in their turn, invaded the enemy's country with their whole force, and re|duced Ni&s;aea, a &s;trong &s;ea-port, with walls reaching as far as Megara. Elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, they expre&s;&s;ed their joy, by celebrating funeral games in honour of tho&s;e who had fallen in battle. It was upon this occa&s;ion that Pericles delivered his famous funeral oration, which has come down to our times, and is generally con&s;idered as a proof at once of his eloquence and his gratitude.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the next year the Lacedaemo|nians invaded Attica with the &s;ame number of forces
<PB N="69" REF="79">
as before, and the Athenians were once more obliged to take refuge within their walls. But a more dreadful calamity, than even that of war, now began to vi&s;it the unhappy Athenians. A plague, and one of the mo&s;t terrible that is record|ed in hi&s;tory, now broke out among them. It is &s;aid to have begun in Ethiopia, whence it de&s;cended into Egypt, from thence travelled into Libya and Per&s;ia, and at la&s;t broke like a flood upon Athens. This pe&s;tilence baffled the utmo&s;t efforts of art; the mo&s;t robu&s;t con&s;titutions were unable to with&s;tand its attacks; no &s;kill could obviate, nor no remedy di&s;pel the infection. The in&s;tant a per&s;on was &s;eized, he was &s;truck with de&s;pair, which quite di&s;|abled him from attempting a cure. The humanity of friends was as fatal to them&s;elves, as it was u&s;e|le&s;s to the unhappy &s;ufferers. The prodigious quan|tity of baggage which had been removed out of the country into the city, increa&s;ed the calamity. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants, for want of better lodging, lived in little cottages, in which they could &s;carce breathe, while the burning heat of the &s;ummer inflamed the malignity of the di&s;temper. They were &s;een con|fu&s;edly huddled together, the dead as well as the living; &s;ome crawling through the &s;treets, &s;ome lying along by the &s;ides of fountains, whither they had endeavoured to repair to quench the raging thir&s;t which con&s;umed them. Their very temples were filled with dead bodies, and every part of the city exhibited a dreadful &s;cene of mortality, without the lea&s;t remedy for the pre&s;ent, or the lea&s;t hopes with regard to futurity. It &s;eized the people with &s;uch violence, that they fell one upon another as they pa&s;&s;ed along the &s;treets. It was al&s;o attended with &s;uch uncommon pe&s;tilential vapours, that the very bea&s;ts and birds of prey, though peri&s;hing with hunger round the walls of the city, would not touch the bodies of tho&s;e who died of it. Even tho&s;e who
<PB N="70" REF="80">
recovered, received &s;uch a terrible &s;hock from it, as affected not only their &s;en&s;es, but the very facul|ties of their mind. It effaced the memory of all the occurrences of their pa&s;t lives, and they knew nei|ther them&s;elves not their neare&s;t relations. The effects of this di&s;ea&s;e are de&s;cribed at large by Thu|cydides, who was &s;ick of it him&s;elf; and he ob&s;erves, among other things, that it introduced into the city a more licentious way of living. For the peo|ple at fir&s;t had recour&s;e to their gods to avert this judgment; but finding they were all equally infect|ed, whether they wor&s;hipped them or not, and that the di&s;ea&s;e was generally mortal, they abandoned them&s;elves at once to de&s;pair and riot; for &s;ince they held their lives but as it were by the day, they were re&s;olved to make the mo&s;t of their time and money. The cau&s;e of it was generally imputed to Pericles, who, by drawing &s;uch numbers into the city, was thought to have corrupted the very air. Yet, though this was raging within, and the enemy wa&s;ting the country without, he &s;till continued of the &s;ame mind as before, that they ought not to ri&s;k all their fortunes on the event of a battle. In the mean time, the Lacedaemonians advancing towards the coa&s;t, laid wa&s;te the whole country, and return|ed, after having in&s;ulted the wretched Athenians, already thinned by pe&s;tilence and famine.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that Pericles, the reputed author of all the&s;e calamities, could long e&s;cape the popular re&s;entment. In fact, he began to be as much hated by the people as ever he had been be|loved by them, and they had actually depo&s;ed him from the command of the army; though, actuated by that ficklene&s;s for which they were remarkable, they &s;oon re-in&s;tated him with more than former authority. But he did not live long to enjoy his honours. He was &s;eized with the plague, and in a
<PB N="71" REF="81">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle time died of it; a man certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many great and amiable qualities, and hardly addicted to a &s;ingle vice, except that of an inordinate ambition.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t memorable tran&s;action of the follow|ing years was the &s;iege of Plataea, one of the mo&s;t famous that is to be found in antiquity, on account of the vigorous efforts of both parties, but chiefly for the glorious re&s;i&s;tance made by the be&s;ieged, and the &s;tratagems they employed to elude the fury of the a&s;&s;ailants. The Lacedaemonians be&s;ieged this place in the beginning of the third campaign, and &s;urrounded it with a &s;trong wall, on which to erect their battering-engines. The be&s;ieged &s;eeing the works begin to ri&s;e round them, threw up a wooden wall upon the walls of the city, in order that they might always out-top the be&s;iegers. Thus both walls &s;eemed to vie with each other for &s;upe|riority, till at la&s;t the be&s;ieged, without amu&s;ing them&s;elves at this work any longer, built another within, in the form of a half moon, behind which they might retire in ca&s;e their other works were forced. In the mean time the be&s;iegers, having mounted their engines of war, &s;hook the city wall in a very terrible manner; which, though it alarm|ed the citizens, did not however di&s;courage them; they employed every art that fortification could &s;ugge&s;t again&s;t the enemy's batteries. They caught with ropes the heads of the battering-rams that were played again&s;t them, and deadened their force with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">evers. The be&s;iegers finding their attack did not go on &s;ucce&s;sfully, and that a new wall was rai&s;ed again&s;t their platform, de&s;paired of being able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake the place by &s;torm; and therefore changed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iege into a blockade, after having in vain attempt|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to &s;et fire to the city, which was &s;uddenly quench|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by a &s;hower. The city was now &s;urrounded by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> brick wall, &s;uddenly erected, &s;trengthened on each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide by a deep ditch. The whole army was &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively
<PB N="72" REF="82">
engaged upon this wall, and when it was fini&s;hed, they left a guard over half of it, the Boeo|tians offering to guard the other half, while the re&s;t of the army returned to Sparta.</P>
<P>In this manner the wretched Plataeans were cooped up by a &s;trong wall, without any hopes of relief, and only awaited the mercy of the conquerors. There were now in Plataea but four hundred na|tives, and four&s;core Athenians, with an hundred and ten women to dre&s;s their victuals, and no other per&s;on, whether freeman or &s;lave, all the re&s;t having been &s;ent to Athens before the &s;iege. At la&s;t, the inhabitants of Plataea, having lo&s;t all hopes of &s;uc|cour, and being in the utmo&s;t want of provi&s;ions, formed a re&s;olution to cut their way through the enemy. Half of them, however, &s;truck with the greatne&s;s of the danger, and the boldne&s;s of the en|terprize, entirely lo&s;t courage when they came to the execution; but the re&s;t, who were about two hundred and twenty &s;oldiers, per&s;i&s;ted in their re&s;o|lution, and effected their e&s;cape in the following manner. Having taken the height of the wall, by counting the rows of bricks that compo&s;ed it, and having made a &s;ufficient number of ladders of a proper length, they &s;et out in the middle of a dark night, and during a violent &s;torm of wind and rain, &s;o that it was hardly po&s;&s;ible either to &s;ee or hear them. Having cro&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t ditch, which they did with one of their legs bare, in order to prevent their &s;liding in the mud, they advanced to the bottom of the wall, and fixing their ladders to it, in a place where they knew it to be unguarded, a party of them a&s;cended, and in&s;tantly made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the two next towers by killing tho&s;e that defended them. This gave an opportunity to their comrades to follow them undi&s;turbed; and as &s;oon as they came up on one &s;ide, they went down on the other, and actually cro&s;&s;ed the outer ditch without being
<PB N="73" REF="83">
attacked, though not entirely without being di&s;co|vered. For while they were coming over the wall, one of them happened to throw down a tile from the parapet, which alarmed the enemy, and their whole army advanced towards the place; but the night was &s;o very dark, that it was ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h one object from another. Nay, before they cro&s;&s;ed the outer ditch, a corps de re&s;erve of three hundred men, that were kept for any unfore&s;enn accident, came up to them with lighted torches; but the&s;e, in&s;tead of di&s;covering them, &s;erved only to render the enemy vi&s;ible. After pa&s;&s;ing the ditch, they directed their cour&s;e for &s;ome time towards Thebes, well knowing the ene|my would never pur&s;ue them that way, as not thinking it po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould march towards a ho&s;tile city; but after proceeding about &s;ix or &s;even &s;tadia, they turned &s;hort towards the mountains, and &s;truck into the road to Athens, where two hundred and twelve of them actually arrived, the re&s;t having returned to the city through fear, one archer ex|cepted, who was taken on the &s;ide of the outer ditch.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Plataeans, who remained in the city, &s;uppo&s;ing that all their companions had been killed, becau&s;e tho&s;e who returned, to ju&s;tify them&s;elves, affirmed they were, &s;ent a herald to de|mand their dead bodies; but being told the true &s;tate of the affair, he withdrew. At the end of the following campaign, the Plataeans being in ab&s;olute want of provi&s;ions, and unable to make any farther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;i&s;tance, &s;urrendered upon condition that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hould not be puni&s;hed till they had the benefit of a re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ular trial.

The Plataeans were much &s;urprized, as well

as puzzled at this que&s;tion, and knew it mu&s;t have been &s;ugge&s;ted by the Thebans, their profe&s;&s;ed ene|mies, who had vowed their de&s;truction. They, therefore, put the Lacedaemonians in mind of the &s;ervices they had done to Greece in general, both at the battle of Artemi&s;ium and that of Plataea; and particularly in Lacedaemonia, at the time of the earthquake, which was followed by the revolt of their &s;laves. The only rea&s;on they a&s;&s;igned for their having joined the Athenians afterwards, was to de|fend them&s;elves from the ho&s;tilities of the Thebans, again&s;t whom they had implored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Lacedaemonians to no purpo&s;e. That if that was imputed to them as a crime, which was only their misfortune, it ought not, however, entirely to obliterate the memory of their former &s;ervices. <Q REND="inline">"Ca&s;t your eyes, &s;aid they, on the monuments of your ance&s;tors which you &s;ee here, to whom we annually pay all the honours which can be rendered to the manes of the dead.

And yet you will now give up their a&s;hes to their murderers, in abandoning us to the Thebans, who fought again&s;t them at the battle of Plataea. Will you en&s;lave a province where Greece recovered its Liberty? Will you de&s;troy the temples of tho&s;e gods to whom you owed the vic|tory?

que&s;tion, whether the Plataeans had done them any &s;ervice in this war? and making them pa&s;s one after another, as they &s;everally an&s;wered no, each was immediately butchered, and not one e&s;caped: about two hundred were killed in this manner; and twenty-five Athenians, who were among them, met with the &s;ame unhappy fate. Their wives, who had been taken pri&s;oners, were made &s;laves. The Thebans afterwards peopled their city with exiles from Me|gara and Thebes, but the next year they demoli&s;hed it entirely. It was in this manner the Lacedaemo|nians, in hopes of reaping great advantages from the Thebans, &s;acrificed the Plataeans to their fury, ninety-three years after their fir&s;t alliance with the Athenians.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians, however, were not &s;o elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, as to make them unwilling to agree to a peace, provided it could be obtained upon honourable terms; and &s;everal overtures for this purpo&s;e were made by their amba&s;&s;adors, but with|out effect; for Cleon, who now guided the coun|cils of the Athenians, boa&s;ted, that he would take all the Spartans in the i&s;land of Sphacteria within twenty days. He accordingly &s;ailed thither in com|pany with Demo&s;thenes, the Athenian admiral (who&s;e courage and conduct his eloquent de&s;cen|dant, of the &s;ame name, afterwards celebrated) and having landed their troops, they attacked the enemy with great vigour, drove them from po&s;t to po&s;t, and gaining ground perpetually, at la&s;t forced them to the extremity of the i&s;land. The Lacedaemo|nians had &s;tormed a fort that was thought inacce&s;|&s;ible. There they drew up in order of battle, and facing about to that &s;ide where alone, they ima|gined, they could be attacked, they defended them|&s;elves like &s;o many lions. But a body of troops having clambered over &s;ome &s;teep rocks, and come upon their rear, they were &s;oon obliged to &s;urrender
<PB N="76" REF="86">
at di&s;cretion. They were carried to Athens, where they were told they &s;hould be allowed to remain in &s;afety till a peace was concluded, provided the La|cedaemonians did not invade the Athenian terri|tories; for in that ca&s;e, they were informed, they &s;hould all be put to death. This tended greatly to pave the way for a general pacification; as the La|cedaemonians were extremely de&s;irous of procuring the relea&s;e of the&s;e men, who were &s;ome of the chief of the city. The war, however, continued for two or three years longer, though without being productive of any remarkable event. The Athe|nians, indeed, took the i&s;land of Cythera; but, in their turn, were defeated by the Lacedaemonians at Dellion. At la&s;t both nations began to grow weary of a conte&s;t, that put them to &s;o great an expence, without procuring them any &s;olid advantage. A truce for a year was, therefore, concluded between them, which afterwards terminated in a more la&s;t|ing reconciliation. This happy event was con&s;i|derably facilitated, by the death of the two generals that commanded their armies, and who had hitherto oppo&s;ed a peace, though from very different motives. Bra&s;idas, the Lacedaemonian, was killed in a &s;ally, which he was conducting when be&s;ieged in Amphi|polis; and Cleon, the Athenian, de&s;pi&s;ing an enemy, to whom he knew him&s;elf &s;uperior, was &s;et upon unawares, and flying for &s;afety, was killed by a &s;oldier who happened to meet him. Bran&s;idas was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage and conduct, of moderation and integrity; and his oppo&s;ition to a peace &s;eems to have proceeded merely from a true Spartan zeal for the honour of his country. Courage, indeed, &s;eems to have been hereditary in his family, as it no doubt was in the whole Spartan nation: for when his mother received the news of his death, &s;he a&s;ked the per&s;ons who brought her the intelligence, whe|ther he died honourably; and when they began to
<PB N="77" REF="87">
launch out into encomiums on his gallantry and heroi&s;m, and to prefer him to all the generals of his time; <Q REND="inline">"yes, &s;aid &s;he, my &s;on was a brave man, but Sparta has &s;till many citizens braver than he."</Q></P>
<P>Cleon was a man of a very different character. He was ra&s;h, arrogant, ob&s;tinate and contentious; and though he &s;ucceeded in his expedition to Sphac|teria, he was by no means fitted for war. He only made u&s;e of it as a cloak for his ill practices, and becau&s;e he could not carry on his other views with|out it. He had, indeed, a readine&s;s of wit, with a kind of law drollery that took with the populace, though with better judges it only pa&s;&s;ed for impu|dence and buffoonery. But what he chiefly de|pended upon was his eloquence; yet even this was of the noi&s;y and boi&s;terous kind, and con&s;i&s;ted more in the vehemence of his utterance, and the violence of his action and ge&s;ture, than in the elegance of his &s;tyle, or the &s;trength of his rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>Matters being now brought into this happy train, a peace was concluded in the tenth year of the war, between the two &s;tates and their confederates, for fifty years. The chief articles of it were, that the &s;orts &s;hould be evacuated, and the towns and pri|&s;oners re&s;tored on both &s;ides. This was called the Nician peace, becau&s;e Nicias, who was ju&s;t the re|ver&s;e of his rival, Cleon, was the chief in&s;trument in effecting it. Be&s;ides the tender concern he al|ways entertained for his country, he had more par|ticular ends in view in bringing it about. He wi&s;hed by this means to &s;ecure his reputation. For though he had &s;ucceeded in mo&s;t of the expeditions in which he had been engaged, he well knew how much he owed to his good fortune and his cautious management, and he did not chu&s;e to ri&s;k the fame he had already acquired, by any attempts to procure more.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. FROM THE PEACE OF NICIAS, TO THE END OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR.</HEAD>
<P>TREATIES of peace, however &s;olemn or &s;in|cere, are but feeble barriers again&s;t the in|tere&s;ts, the inclinations, or the prejudices of rival &s;tates, or even again&s;t the ambitious views of tho&s;e that have the chief direction of their councils. This was fatally experienced in the war, that, not|with&s;tanding their late agreement, &s;oon after broke out between the Athenians and Spartans, not to promote the welfare, or advance the power of either people, but merely to gratify the pride and vanity of Alcibiades, who was now become the mo&s;t popular man in Athens. Many things contributed to make him &s;o. He was as remarkable for the beauty of his per&s;on, as the endowments of his mind. He was de&s;cended from one of the greate&s;t families in Athens; he was the riche&s;t man in the place; and his &s;tyle and manner of living was equal to his in|come. Add to this, that though he was frequently drawn into irregularities by the pernicious advice of flatterers, with whom he was naturally &s;ur|rounded, and the violence of his own pa&s;&s;ions, which were ever in the extreme, yet he was as often recalled from the&s;e vicious cour&s;es, and brought back into the paths of virtue, by the &s;alutary coun|&s;els of Socrates, for who&s;e character he had con|ceived the highe&s;t regard, and to who&s;e le&s;&s;ons he always gave the greate&s;t attention.</P>

of cultivating the&s;e, and bringing them to maturity, that &s;o, when he grew up, in&s;tead of being a cur&s;e and di&s;grace, he might prove an honour and a ble&s;|&s;ing to his country. And &s;o fully was he convinced of the a&s;cendant he had acquired over the mind of this young man, that whenever he heard he was in|dulging him&s;elf in any low or vicious plea&s;ures, he would pur&s;ue him as a ma&s;ter does a fugitive &s;lave, and &s;everely reprimand him for his folly; and the other would li&s;ten to him with all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of a dutiful &s;on to the be&s;t of fathers.

<P>His ruling pa&s;&s;ion, indeed, &s;eems to have been the love of power, and a de&s;ire of &s;uperiority; and of this he is &s;aid to have given &s;everal &s;triking in|&s;tances, even while a boy. One day being rather over-matched in wre&s;tling, and fearing to be thrown down, he got the hand of his antagoni&s;t in his mouth, and bit it with all his force; upon which the other let go is hold, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Alcibiades, you bite like a woman."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"No, replied he, I bite like a lion."</Q> At another time when he was playing in the &s;treet at &s;ome game of chance, a loaded cart happenend to come that way when it was his turn to throw. At fir&s;t he called out to the driver to &s;top, becau&s;e he was going to throw in the road, over which the cart was to pa&s;s. But the fellow did not &s;eem to mind him, but &s;till drove on, upon which all the re&s;t of the boys divided and made way; but Alcibiades throwing him&s;elf on his face before the cart, and &s;tretching out his limbs, bid the car|ter drive on if he would; at which the man was &s;o &s;tartled, that he put back his hor&s;es, and Alcibiades was allowed to have his throw before the cart pa&s;&s;ed. His ambition naturally increa&s;ed with his years, and
<PB N="80" REF="90">
when he came to be a man, like Pompey in later times, in&s;tead of being able to bear a &s;uperior, he could not even endure an equal. For this rea&s;on it was, that he &s;et him&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to Nicias, who was as much re&s;pected by his own countrymen, and much more by the Lacedaemonians, who e&s;teem|ed him for his moderation and love of ju&s;tice. And on the &s;ame account, he conceived an incurable prejudice again&s;t the Lacedaemonians them&s;elves for this preference given to his rival, and did every thing in his power to excite a quarrel between them and the Athenians.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep he took for this purpo&s;e was, to in&s;tigate the people of Argos to break with the Lacedaemonians; a&s;&s;uring them, that, if they did &s;o, they &s;hould &s;oon be &s;upported by the whole power of Athens; and the fact is, every thing was in a fair way for a treaty between the Athenians and Argives, when the Lacedaemonians, informed of the&s;e negotiations, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Athens, in order to remon&s;trate, and inve&s;ted them with full power to &s;ettle all matters in di&s;pute in an ami|cable manner. This commi&s;&s;ion &s;eemed to &s;atisfy the council, to whom it was fir&s;t communicated; and the people were to a&s;&s;emble the next day, to give the amba&s;&s;adors an audience. Alcibiades, fearing that this would mar his &s;chemes, had re|cour&s;e to the following artifice. He contrived to have a private conference with the amba&s;&s;adors, and per&s;uaded them, under colour of friend&s;hip, not to let the people know at fir&s;t what full powers they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but merely to intimate that they came to treat and make propo&s;als; for that otherwi&s;e the people would grow exorbitant in their demands, and endeavour to extort from them &s;uch unrea&s;onable terms as they could not with honour con&s;ent to. The &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded. The amba&s;&s;adors be|lieving him &s;incere, withdrew their confidence from
<PB N="81" REF="91">
Nicias, and repo&s;ed it in him; and the next day, when the people were a&s;&s;embled, and the amba&s;&s;adors introduced, Alcibiades, with a very obliging air, demanded of them with what powers they were come. They made an&s;wer, that they were not come as plenipotentiaries. Upon which he in&s;tant|ly changed his voice and countenance, and ex|claiming again&s;t them as notorious liars, bid the people take care how they tran&s;acted any thing with men, on who&s;e veracity they could have &s;o little de|pendence. The people di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the amba&s;&s;adors in a rage; and Nicias, knowing nothing of the deceit, was confounded and in di&s;grace. To re|deem his credit, he propo&s;ed being &s;ent once more to Sparta; but not being able to obtain &s;uch terms as the Athenians demanded, they immediately upon his return &s;truck up a league with the Argives for an hundred years, including the Eleans and Man|tenaeans; which yet did not in terms cancel that with the Lacedaemonians, though it is plain, that the whole &s;cope of it was levelled again&s;t them. Upon this new alliance Alcibiades was declared general; and though even his be&s;t friends could not commend the method by which he had accompli&s;hed his de&s;igns, yet it was looked upon as a great &s;troke in politics thus to divide and &s;hake almo&s;t all Pelo|ponne&s;us, and to remove the war &s;o far from the Athenian frontier, that even &s;ucce&s;s would profit the enemy but little, &s;hould they be conquerors; whereas, if they were defeated, Sparta it&s;elf would hardly be &s;afe.</P>
<P>The Spartans, however, were determined to cru&s;h the evil in the bud; and accordingly drawing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut their whole force, both of citizens and &s;laves, and being joined by their allies, they encamped al|mo&s;t under the walls of Argos. The Argives were not &s;low in meeting them; they immediately marched out, and offered them battle. But ju&s;t as
<PB N="82" REF="92">
the two armies were going to engage, a truce was concluded for four months, as a previous &s;tep to|wards an amicable &s;ettlement of all differences.</P>
<P>The Athenians thinking they had now found the Spartans &s;ufficient employment by the troubles they had excited in Peloponne&s;us, began to extend their views to more di&s;tant objects, and they actually formed a de&s;ign of adding the i&s;land of Sicily to their empire. The people of Ege&s;ta &s;upplied them with a plau&s;ible pretext for executing this project. They applied to the Athenians, in quality of their allies, craving their aid again&s;t the inhabitants of Selinuta, who were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Syracu&s;ans. This opportunity was greedily laid hold of; but not to engage in a war without being &s;ure of the means of carrying it on with &s;pirit, the Athenians &s;ent deputies to Ege&s;ta, to inquire into the &s;tate of affairs, and &s;ee whether there was money enough in the trea&s;ury to defray the expence of &s;o great an un|dertaking. The people of that city had lately bor|rowed from the neighbouring &s;tates a great num|ber of gold and &s;ilver va&s;es, of an immen&s;e value; and of the&s;e they now made a &s;plendid di&s;play to the Athenian deputies. Upon the return, therefore, of the&s;e la&s;t, a re&s;olution was immediately taken to comply with the reque&s;t of the Ege&s;tans; and Al|cibiades, Nicias, and Lamachus were appointed to command the fleet, with full power not only to &s;uc|cour Ege&s;ta, and re&s;tore the inhabitants of Leon|tium to their city, of which they had been deprived by the Syracu&s;ans, but al&s;o to regulate the affairs of Sicily in &s;uch a manner, as might be&s;t &s;uit the in|tere&s;ts of the republic.</P>
<P>Nicias was extremely unea&s;y at his being ap+pointed to this command, partly becau&s;e he di&s;ap|proved of the war it&s;elf, but chiefly becau&s;e he was joined in commi&s;&s;ion with Alcibiades. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Athenians thought it nece&s;&s;ary to temper th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="83" REF="93">
ardour and impetuo&s;ity of the one with the coolne&s;s and deliberation of the other. Nicias, therefore, not daring to oppo&s;e the war openly, endeavoured to do it indirectly, by repre&s;enting the great number of difficulties with which it would be attended. He &s;aid, that a fleet would not be &s;ufficient; that a land army mu&s;t likewi&s;e be rai&s;ed, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted at an immen&s;e expence; for as to the pompous promi&s;es made them by the Ege&s;tans, the&s;e might probably fail them at a time when they &s;tood mo&s;t in need of pecu|niary aid: that they ought to weigh well the great di&s;|parity between them and the enemy, with regard to the conveniencies they would re&s;pectively enjoy: that the Syracu&s;ans would be in their own country, in the mid&s;t of powerful allies, di&s;po&s;ed by inclina|tion, as well as engaged by intere&s;t, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with men, money, hor&s;es, and provi&s;ions; whereas the Athenians would carry on the war in a remote country, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by their enemies, where, in win|ter, news could not be brought them from home in le&s;s than four months; a country where all things would oppo&s;e the Athenians, and nothing be procured but by force of arms: that, even if the expedition &s;ucceeded, it would not be productive of the mighty advantages expected from it; and, if it failed, it would reflect eternal di&s;grace upon the Athenian name: and that, for his own part, he was deter|mined not to go, unle&s;s he was &s;upplied with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the war, as he would not depend upon the caprice or precarious promi&s;es of allies. This &s;peech, however, in&s;tead of cool|ing the ardour of the Athenians, as Nicias expected, &s;erved only to inflame it more: and orders were immediately given for rai&s;ing as many troops, and fitting out as many gallies as the generals thought nece&s;&s;ary; and the levies accordingly were carried on in Athens, and other places, with incredible &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="94">Before we enter upon the narration of the im|portant events that took place in the expedition to Sicily, it will be proper to &s;ay a few words re|&s;pecting Syracu&s;e, the capital of that i&s;land. About the year of the world 2920, Corinth had acquired con&s;iderable reputation as a maritime power. As the improvement of navigation generally leads to di&s;covery, &s;o it leads to commerce al&s;o, and to colonization. It had this effect on the Corinthians. They had not been long acquainted with Sicily, before they projected the &s;cheme of peopling part of it with the natives of Peloponne&s;us. Ar|chias, therefore, a de&s;cendant of Hercules, was &s;ent thither with a fleet, furni&s;hed with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an enterprize. He built and peopled Syracu&s;e, which, from the peculiar advan|tages it derived from its rich &s;oil and capacious har|bour, &s;oon became the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city in Sicily: in &s;ize, indeed, and beauty, it yielded not to any city in Greece. It was long &s;ubject to Corinth, and governed by nearly the &s;ame laws. But as it in|crea&s;ed in power, it aimed at independence, and by degrees renounced its allegiance to Corinth. To its emancipation are owing the occurrences which we are now to recite.</P>
<P>The levies being by this time completed, the generals re&s;olved to &s;et &s;ail immediately, after hav|ing appointed Corcyra as the place of rendezvous for mo&s;t of the allies, and &s;uch &s;hips as were to carry the provi&s;ions and warlike &s;tores. All the citizens, as well as foreigners, in Athens, flocked by day|break to the port of Pyraeus, in order to behold this magnificent &s;ight. It was, indeed, a &s;pectacle well worth their curio&s;ity; for neither Athens, nor any other city had ever fitted out &s;uch a grand and gal|lant fleet as the pre&s;ent. True it is, that tho&s;e which had been &s;ent again&s;t Epidaurus and Potidaea, were as con&s;iderable with re&s;pect to the number of
<PB N="85" REF="95">
&s;oldiers and &s;hips; but then they were not equipped with &s;o much magnificence, neither was their voyage &s;o long, nor the enterprize &s;o important. The city had furni&s;hed an hundred empty gallies, that is, three&s;core light ones, and forty to tran&s;port the heavy-armed &s;oldiers. Every mariner received daily a drachma, or ten pence Engli&s;h, for his pay, exclu&s;ive of what the captains of &s;hips gave the rowers of the fir&s;t bench. When the &s;hips were loaded, and the troops got on board, the trumpet &s;ounded, and &s;olemn prayers were offered up for the &s;ucce&s;s of the expediton. Gold and &s;ilver cups were filling every where with wine, and the accu&s;|tomed libations were poured out; the people, who lined the &s;hore, &s;houting at the &s;ame time, and lift|ing up their hands to heaven, to wi&s;h their fellow-citizens a good voyage and &s;ucce&s;s. And now the hymn being &s;ung, and the ceremonies ended, the &s;hips &s;ailed one after another out of the harbour, after which they &s;trove to out&s;ail one another, till they all arrived at Aegina. From thence they made to Corcyra; where the army of the allies was a&s;&s;em|bled with the re&s;t of the fleet.</P>
<P>Upon their arrival at Sicily, the generals were divided in their opinions with regard to the place where they &s;hould make a de&s;cent. Lamachus was for &s;ailing directly to Syracu&s;e, and attacking the town, before the inhabitants had time to recover from their fir&s;t con&s;ternation. But his propo&s;al was rejected, and it was thought more expedient to reduce the &s;maller cities fir&s;t. Detaching, therefore, ten gallies to take a view of the harbour and &s;itua|tion of Syracu&s;e, they landed with the re&s;t of their forces, and &s;urprized Catana.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the enemies of Alcibiades took advantage of his ab&s;ence to traduce his cha|racter, which, indeed, was &s;ufficiently open to at|tack. They accu&s;ed him of having neglected the
<PB N="86" REF="96">
proper method of invading Sicily, and they further charged him with impiety in profaning the my&s;te|ries of Ceres. This was &s;ufficient to induce the giddy multitude to recal their general; but for fear of exciting a tumult in the army, they only &s;ent him orders to return to Athens, that &s;o he might pacify the people by his pre&s;ence. Alcibiades pre|tended to obey the order with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; but reflecting on the incon&s;tancy and caprice of his judges, he no &s;ooner reached Thurium than he di&s;appeared, and the galley, therefore, returned without him. For this act of contumacy he was condemned to death, his whole e&s;tate was confi&s;|cated, and all the orders of religion were com|manded to cur&s;e him. Some time after upon news being brought him that the Athenians had con|demned him to death, <Q REND="inline">"I hope one day, &s;aid he, to make them &s;en&s;ible that I am &s;till alive."</Q></P>
<P>The Syracu&s;ans had by this time put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of defence, and finding that Nicias did not advance towards them, they talked of attacking him in his camp; and &s;ome of them a&s;ked, in a &s;coffing way, whether he was come into Sicily to &s;ettle at Catana? He was rouzed by this in&s;ult, and determined to &s;hew them that he was deficient neither in courage nor conduct. He was afraid, however, of attacking the place by land for want of cavalry; and it was almo&s;t equally hazardous to make a de&s;cent by &s;ea: neverthele&s;s, he cho&s;e the latter method, and &s;ucceeded in it by a &s;tratagem. He had gained a citizen of Catana to go as a de|&s;erter to the Syracu&s;ans, and to inform them, that the Athenians lay every night in the town without their arms; and that early in the morning, on a certain day appointed, they might &s;urprize them, &s;eize on their camp with all their arms and bag|gage, burn their fleet in the harbour, and de&s;troy their whole army. The Syracu&s;ans gave credit to
<PB N="87" REF="97">
this intelligence, and marched with all their forces towards Catana, which Nicias was no &s;ooner in|formed of, than he embarked his troops, and &s;teer|ing away for Syracu&s;e, landed them there the next morning, and fortified him&s;elf in the out&s;kirts of the town. The Syracu&s;ans were &s;o provoked at this trick being put upon them, that they immedi|ately returned to Syracu&s;e, and pre&s;ented them&s;elves without the walls in order of battle. Nicias marched out of his trenches to meet them, and a very &s;harp action en&s;ued, in which the Athenians, at length, got the better, and forced the enemy back to the city, after having killed two hundred and &s;ixty of them and their allies, with the lo&s;s of fifty of their own men. They were not, however, yet in a condition to attack the city, and they, therefore, took up their winter quarters at Naxus and Catana.</P>
<P>Next &s;pring, having received a &s;upply of hor&s;e from Athens, together with provi&s;ions and other warlike &s;tores, Nicias re&s;olved to block up the place both by &s;ea and land. The fir&s;t thing he did for this purpo&s;e was to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Epipolae, a high hill which commanded the city, and could only be a&s;cended by one very &s;teep and craggy pa&s;&s;age. The Syracu&s;ans were &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the importance of this po&s;t, that they did every thing in their power to prevent his &s;eizing it; but Nicias landed his troops &s;o &s;ecretly and &s;o &s;uddenly, that he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it before they were aware. He even repul&s;ed a body of &s;even hundred men who were coming to di&s;lodge him, having killed three hundred of them together with their leader. Here he built a fort, and began to inve&s;t the town in &s;uch a manner, as to cut off all communication between it and the country. In the cour&s;e of this work &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes happened, in one of which Lamachus was &s;lain, &s;o that the &s;ole command
<PB N="88" REF="98">
now devolved upon Nicias. The Syracu&s;ans made another attempt to regain this po&s;t. Nicias was then &s;ick in the fort, and in bed, with only his &s;er|vants about him. But when he found the enemy were forcing his intrenchments, he got up, and &s;et fire to the engines, and other wood that lay &s;cat|tered about the &s;ort; which had &s;o good an effect, that it &s;erved as a &s;ignal to his own troops to come up to his relief; and &s;o terrified and confounded tho&s;e of the enemy, that they retreated into the city.</P>
<P>From this time Nicias began to conceive great hopes of taking the place, the rather as &s;everal of the other cities of Sicily came over to his intere&s;t, and &s;upplied his troops with all kinds of provi&s;ions. The Syracu&s;ans, on their &s;ide, &s;eeing them&s;elves blocked up both by &s;ea and land, and de&s;pairing of being able to hold out much longer, were already beginning to think of a &s;urrender. Nay, they had actually &s;ummoned a council to &s;ettle the terms of a capitulation, when, to their great joy and &s;ur|prize, becau&s;e contrary to their expectation, they &s;aw Gylippus, the Lacedaemonian general, arrive with a force, that &s;oon relieved them from all their fears, and in a little time reduced the Athenians to a more deplorable &s;ituation than that in which they them&s;elves were now placed. Gylippus, con&s;cious of his own &s;trength, and perhaps a little actuated by Spartan pride, &s;ent a herald to the Athenians to acquaint them, that he would allow them five days to leave Sicily. Nicias did not deign to give any an&s;wer to this propo&s;al, and both &s;ides therefore prepared them&s;elves for battle.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t engagement the Spartans were de|feated, chiefly on account of the narrowne&s;s of ground where they fought, which was between the two walls, which the Athenians had rai&s;ed to inve&s;t the city; and as this prevented Gylippus from ex|tending
<PB N="89" REF="99">
his lines, or making u&s;e of his hor&s;e, the Athenians got the better. Gylippus, however, had the magnanimity, or rather indeed good policy, to take the whole blame of the mi&s;carriage upon him|&s;elf. He declared, that he, and not his men were in fault; and that he would &s;oon give them an op|portunity of recovering his honour and their own; and accordingly the very next day attacking the enemy in a more advantageous &s;pot, he obtained over them a more complete victory than they had done over him: &s;o much does the event of a battle depend upon the nature of the ground where it is fought.</P>
<P>Nicias being by this means obliged to act upon the defen&s;ive, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Plemmyrium near the great harbour, where he built three forts, and almo&s;t &s;hut him&s;elf up in garri&s;on. Be&s;ides, the Lacedaemonians were now con&s;iderably &s;trengthened by a reinforcement they received from Corinth. In this &s;tate of affairs, Nicias wrote home a mo&s;t melancholy account of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. He told his countrymen, that, in&s;tead of be&s;ieging the Syracu&s;ans, he him&s;elf was now be&s;ieged by them and their allies: that the towns revolted from him, the &s;laves and mercenaries de&s;erted, and his troops were employed in guarding the forts and bringing in provi&s;ions, in which la&s;t &s;ervice many of them were cut off by the enemy's hor&s;e. He added, that unle&s;s a reinforcement was &s;ent him, equal to that with which he had originally &s;et out, it was in vain to think of attempting any thing farther: and, in any event, he begged, that he him&s;elf might be recalled, as his health was &s;o much impaired as to render him incapable of going on with the &s;ervice. This la&s;t part of his reque&s;t, however, the Athenians would by no means con|&s;ent to: but they re&s;olved to &s;end out Eurymedon and Demo&s;thenes with fre&s;h &s;upplies; the former
<PB N="90" REF="100">
immediately with ten gallies, and the other early in the &s;pring with a &s;tronger force. At the &s;ame time they appointed Menander and Euthydemus as a&s;&s;i&s;t|ants to Nicias; and the&s;e immediately joined him.</P>
<P>But Gylippus was determined to be beforehand with the Athenians, and to cru&s;h, if po&s;&s;ible, the force they now had in Sicily, before the &s;uccours &s;hould arrive. For this purpo&s;e he per&s;uaded the Syracu&s;ans to hazard a battle by &s;ea, while he &s;hould endeavour to &s;torm the forts of Plemmyrium. The former part of the &s;cheme failed; the latter &s;uc|ceeded. The Athenians had only &s;ixty &s;hips to oppo&s;e to eighty of the Syracu&s;ans; but as they were greatly &s;uperior to them in naval &s;kill, they at la&s;t got the better, though victory &s;eemed at fir&s;t to incline to the &s;ide of the enemy. The Athe|nians lo&s;t three &s;hips in this engagement; but the Syracu&s;ans had nine &s;unk, and three taken. In the mean time, Gylippus attacking the forts at Plem|myrium, while many of tho&s;e, who defended them, were gone to the &s;hore in order to view the &s;ea-fight, he carried the greate&s;t of them by &s;torm; and this &s;o intimidated the garri&s;ons of the other two, that they abandoned them in a moment.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, he re&s;olved to repeat his blow before the arrival of the Athenian &s;uc|cours. He therefore per&s;uaded the Syracu&s;ans to venture another battle by &s;ea. They did &s;o, and with a greater degree of good fortune than had at|tended them on the former occa&s;ion. Nicias would willingly have declined this engagement; but he was over-ruled, or rather over-per&s;uaded, by his two colleagues, Menander and Euthydemus. The Athenians had &s;eventy-five gallies, the Syracu&s;ans eighty. The fir&s;t day the two fleets continued in &s;ight of each other, without coming to a general engagement, and only a few &s;kirmi&s;hes pa&s;&s;ed be|tween them. The Syracu&s;ans did not make the
<PB N="91" REF="101">
lea&s;t motion the &s;econd day. But on the third they came up much &s;ooner than u&s;ual, when a great part of the day was &s;pent in &s;kirmi&s;hing, after which they retired. The Athenians not imagining they would return again that day, did not keep them&s;elves in readine&s;s to receive them. But the Syracu&s;ans hav|ing refre&s;hed them&s;elves in great ha&s;te, and gone on board their gallies, attacked the Athenians un|awares, and in a little time threw them into irre|trievable confu&s;ion. The&s;e la&s;t, indeed, would have received a much more &s;evere blow, had they not taken &s;helter behind their tran&s;ports, which had been previou&s;ly drawn up in a line to protect them. They lo&s;t, however, on this occa&s;ion &s;even gallies; and a great number of their &s;oldiers were either killed or taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>While Nicias was reflecting with grief upon his pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ituation, and looking forward with terror to the &s;till more melancholy pro&s;pect that lay before him, he was relieved from all his unea&s;ine&s;s, by the arrival of Demo&s;thenes's fleet, which now came forward in great pomp and &s;plen|dour. It con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy-three gallies, on board of which were five thou&s;and fighting men, and above three thou&s;and archers, &s;lingers, and bowmen. This was a force, which, if properly managed, might have turned the &s;cale of victory yet once more in favour of the Athenians; but, by the precipitancy of Demo&s;thenes, and the other ge|nerals, in oppo&s;itition to the more cautious mea|&s;ures recommended by Nicias, it only &s;erved to heighten their di&s;grace and the enemy's triumph.</P>
<P>It was re&s;olved, in a council of war, to attack the town immediately; and, as a previous &s;tep to it, to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Epipolae. In their fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault upon this latter place, which was made by night, they &s;tormed the outer entrenchment; but as they were advancing towards the &s;econd,
<PB N="92" REF="102">
they were &s;uddenly attacked by the forces of the city, which had marched under arms out of their lines, and were &s;upported by Gylippus. The&s;e, however, being &s;eized with a&s;toni&s;hment, which the darkne&s;s increa&s;ed, were &s;oon put to flight; but a body of Boeotians, who followed them, made a more vigorous &s;tand, and marching again&s;t the Athenians with their pikes pre&s;ented, repul&s;ed them with great &s;houts, and committed a mo&s;t dreadful &s;laughter. This &s;pread an univer&s;al terror through the re&s;t of the army. Tho&s;e, who fled, either forced along &s;uch as were advancing to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, or el&s;e mi&s;taking them for enemies, turned their arms again&s;t them. They were now all mixed indi&s;criminately, it being impo&s;&s;ible, amid&s;t the horrors of &s;o dark a night, to di&s;tingui&s;h friend from foe; and death was frequently inflicted by that hand, from which, in the day-time, protection would have been received. The Athenians &s;ought for one another to no purpo&s;e; and from their often a&s;king the word, by which only they were able to know one another, a &s;trange confu&s;ion of &s;ounds was heard, which occa&s;ioned no little di&s;order; not to mention that they by this means divulged their watch-word to the enemy, and could not learn theirs; becau&s;e, by their being together, and in a body, they had no occa&s;ion to repeat it. In the mean time, tho&s;e who were pur&s;ued, threw them|&s;elves from the top of the rocks, and many were da&s;hed to pieces by the fall; and as mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who e&s;|caped, &s;traggled from one another up and down the fields and woods, they were cut to pieces the next day by the enemy's hor&s;e who pur&s;ued them. Two thou&s;and Athenians were &s;lain in this engage|ment, and a great quantity of arms was taken; tho&s;e who fled having thrown them away, that they might be the better able to e&s;cape over the preci|pices.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="103">Thus were at once bla&s;ted all the flattering hopes which the Athenians had conceived on the arrival of Demo&s;thenes; and Gylippus having &s;oon after made the tour of Sicily, and brought in with him a great number of fre&s;h troops, acquired by that means &s;uch an indi&s;puted &s;uperiority over the Athe|nians, that the&s;e la&s;t, convinced of their utter in|ability to make any further head again&s;t him, re|&s;olved immediately to abandon the i&s;land, and re|turn to their own country. But ju&s;t as they were upon the point of embarking, (wholly un&s;u&s;pected by the enemy, who never &s;uppo&s;ed they would quit the i&s;land &s;o &s;oon) the moon was &s;uddenly eclip&s;ed: and as this was a phaenomenon, with the real cau&s;e of which they were utterly unacquainted, they con|cluded it to be a prodigy or portent, and therefore dreaded the con&s;equences of it. It had been cu&s;|tomary, upon former occa&s;ions, to &s;u&s;pend the ex|ecution of any enterprize for three days after &s;uch an accident happened. But the &s;ooth&s;ayers, being now con&s;ulted, &s;aid, that the Athenians mu&s;t not &s;ail till nine times three days were pa&s;t (the&s;e are Thucydides's words) which doubtle&s;s was a my&s;te|rious number in the opinion of the people. Nicias, &s;crupulous to a fault, and full of a mi&s;taken vene|ration for tho&s;e blind interpreters of the will of the gods, declared that he would wait a whole revo|lution of the moon, and not &s;et &s;ail till the &s;ame day of the next month, as if he had not &s;een the planet &s;hine with her u&s;ual brightne&s;s the moment &s;he emerged from the &s;hadow of the earth by which &s;he had been darkened.</P>
<P>The Syracu&s;ans, however, being informed of the intended departure of the Athenians, were deter|mined not to let them retire in peace, and, if po&s;|&s;ible, not even retire at all; but either to cut them off entirely, or oblige them to &s;urrender as pri&s;oners of war. For this purpo&s;e, they attacked
<PB N="94" REF="104">
the entrenchments immediately, and gained a &s;light advantage over them. The next day they made a &s;econd attack, and at the &s;ame time &s;ailed with &s;eventy-&s;ix gallies again&s;t eighty-&s;ix of the Athe|nians. After an ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, the Athenians were defeated with the lo&s;s of eighteen of their &s;hips, which were taken by the enemy, and their crews cut to pieces. Eurymedon too, their com|mander, lo&s;t his life in the engagement.</P>
<P>In order to prevent their e&s;caping by &s;ea, the enemy &s;hut up the mouth of the great harbour, which was about five hundred paces wide, with gallies placed cro&s;s-wi&s;e, and other ve&s;&s;els, fixed with anchors and iron chains, and at the &s;ame time made the re|qui&s;ite preparations for a battle, in ca&s;e they &s;hould have courage to engage again. The Athenians &s;eeing them&s;elves cooped up in this manner, and having no other means of procuring provi&s;ions but by being ma&s;ters of the &s;ea, were obliged to hazard another engagement upon that element. Both commanders exerted all their eloquence to animate their men, and none could be actuated by &s;tronger motives than now influenced them; for upon the i&s;&s;ue of the battle, which was going to be fought, depended not only their own lives and liberties, but even the fate of their native country. This battle was more ob&s;tinate and bloody than any of the preceding ones. The Athenians being arrived at the mouth of the port, ea&s;ily took the fir&s;t &s;hips they came to; but when they attempted to break the chain of the re&s;t, the enemy poured in upon them from all quarters. As near two hundred gal|lies came ru&s;hing on each &s;ide into a narrow place, there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be very great confu&s;ion, and the ve&s;&s;els could not ea&s;ily advance, or retire, or turn about to renew the attack. The beaks of the gallies, for this rea&s;on, did little execution; but there were very furious and frequent di&s;charges.
<PB N="95" REF="105">
The Athenians were overwhelmed with a &s;hower of &s;tones, which always did execution from what|ever place they were thrown; whereas they de|fended them&s;elves only by &s;hooting darts and arrows, which, by the motion of the &s;hips, were diverted from their aim, and &s;eldom hit the mark at which they were levelled. Ari&s;ton, the Corinthian, had given the Syracu&s;ans this coun&s;el. The&s;e di&s;|charges being over, the heavy-armed &s;oldiers at|tempted to board the enemy's &s;hips, in order to fight hand to hand: and it frequently happened, that while they were climbing up one &s;ide of the&s;e, their own &s;hips were entered on the other, &s;o that two or three &s;hips were &s;ometime grappled toge|ther, which occa&s;ioned great confu&s;ion. Add to this, that the noi&s;e of the &s;hips which da&s;hed again&s;t one another, and the different cries of the victors and vanqui&s;hed, prevented the orders of the officers from being di&s;tinctly heard. The Athenians wanted to force a pa&s;&s;age, whatever might be the con&s;equence, in order to &s;ecure their return to their own country; and this the enemy endeavoured to prevent, that they might thereby gain a more com|plete victory. The two land armies, which were drawn up on the highe&s;t part of the &s;hore, were &s;pectators of the action, while the inhabitants of the city ran to the walls in order to behold it. All the&s;e &s;aw clearly, becau&s;e of their little di&s;tance from the fleets, every thing that pa&s;&s;ed, and con|templated the battle as from an amphitheatre, but not without great anxiety and terror. Attentive to, and &s;huddering at every movement, and the &s;everal changes of fortune that happened, they di&s;covered the concern they had in the battle, their fears, their hopes, their grief, their joy, by different cries and different ge&s;tures; &s;tretching out their hands &s;ome|times towards the combatants to animate them, at other times towards heaven, to implore the &s;uc|cour
<PB N="96" REF="106">
and protection of the gods. At la&s;t the Athe|nian fleet, after making a long and vigorous re&s;i&s;t|ance, was put to flight, and driven again&s;t the &s;hore. The Syracu&s;ans on the walls, &s;eeing their countrymen victorious, conveyed the news to the whole city by an univer&s;al &s;hout. The victors im|mediately &s;ailed towards Syracu&s;e, where they erected a trophy, while the Athenians were &s;o much dejected, that they did not even reque&s;t the dead bodies of their fellow &s;oldiers to be delivered to them, in order to honour them with the rites of burial.</P>
<P>There now remained but two methods for them to chu&s;e; either to attempt the pa&s;&s;age a &s;econd time, for which they had &s;till &s;hips and &s;oldiers &s;uf|ficient; or to abandon their fleet to the enemy, and retire by land. Demo&s;thenes recommended the former plan; but the &s;oldiers were &s;o much inti|midated by their late defeat, that they had not cou|rage to undertake it. The &s;econd method was therefore adopted; and they accordingly prepared to &s;et out in the night, the better to conceal their march from the enemy. Hermocrates, however, the Syracu&s;an general, was extremely unwilling, that &s;o large a body of men (amounting to near forty thou&s;and) &s;hould be &s;uffered to depart, le&s;t they &s;hould fortify them&s;elves in &s;ome corner of the i&s;land, and renew the war. At the &s;ame time he knew it would be impo&s;&s;ible to per&s;uade the Syracu&s;ans to oppo&s;e their march that evening, as they were then engaged in celebrating their late victory, and &s;olemnizing the fe&s;tival of Hercules. He therefore fell upon another expedient. He &s;ent out a few hor&s;emen, who were to pa&s;s for friends of the Athenians, and ordered them to tell Nicias not to retire till day-light, as the Syracu&s;ans lay in ambu&s;h for him, and had &s;eized on all the pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Nicias was &s;o weak as to believe this intelli|gence, and accordingly delayed his departure not
<PB N="97" REF="107">
only that evening but the whole next day, in order that the &s;oldiers might have more time to prepare for their march, and carry off whatever might be nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But this delay after|wards proved fatal to them. For early next morn|ing the enemy took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the difficult avenues, fortified the banks of the rivers in tho&s;e parts where they were fordable, broke down the bridges, and &s;pread detachments of hor&s;e up and down the plain, &s;o that there was not one place which the Athenians could pa&s;s without fighting.</P>
<P>They &s;et out upon their march the third day after the battle, with a de&s;ign to retire to Catana. Their army was divided into two bodies, both drawn up in the form of a phalanx, the fir&s;t being commanded by Nicias, and the &s;econd by Demo&s;thenes, with the baggage in the centre. In this manner they proceeded for &s;everal days, during which they were terribly harra&s;&s;ed by the enemy, who hung upon their rear, and overwhelmed them with &s;howers of darts and arrows, but never would &s;tand a general engagement, when the Athenians wheeled about.</P>
<P>Finding, therefore, their numbers daily decrea&s;e, and being at the &s;ame time in extreme want of pro|vi&s;ions, they altered their plan, and, in&s;tead of con|tinuing their march to Catana, they directed their route towards Camerina and Gela. As this &s;cheme was executed in the night, it was attended with &s;o much confu&s;ion, that the rear-guard under De|mo&s;thenes &s;oon parted from the main body, and lo&s;t their way. Next day the Syracu&s;ans came up with them, and &s;urrounded them in a narrow place; and though they defended them&s;elves for &s;ome time with incredible bravery, yet finding it impo&s;&s;ible to effect their e&s;cape, they were at la&s;t obliged to &s;urrender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;oners of war, which they did upon condition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat they &s;hould not be put to death, nor con|demned
<PB N="98" REF="108">
to perpetual impri&s;onment. About &s;ix thou&s;and men &s;urrendered upon the&s;e terms.</P>
<P>In the mean time Nicias procceeded on his march, and cro&s;&s;ing the river Erineus, encamped on a mountain, where the enemy overtook him the next day, and &s;ummoned him to &s;urrender, as Demo&s;thenes had done. Nicias at fir&s;t could not believe what they told him concerning De|mo&s;thenes, and therefore begged leave to &s;end &s;ome hor&s;e to inquire into the truth; and when he found that matters really were &s;o, he offered to defray all the expences of the war, provided they would &s;uffer him to quit the i&s;land with his forces. But this pro|po&s;al was rejected by the enemy, who immediately renewed the attack; and though Nicias defended him&s;elf during the whole night, and even conti|nued his march next day to the river A&s;inarus, yet he was quickly pur&s;ued thither by the Syracu&s;ans, who threw mo&s;t of the Athenians into the &s;tream, the re&s;t having already thrown them&s;elves into it, in order to quench their burning thir&s;t. Here the mo&s;t terrible havock was committed; &s;o that Nicias finding all things de&s;perate, was obliged to &s;urren|der upon this &s;ingle condition, that Gylippus &s;hould di&s;continue the fight, and &s;pare the lives of his men. The lives of the men, indeed, were &s;pared; but Nicias and Demo&s;thenes, after being &s;courged with rods, were cruelly put to death, a &s;triking proof of the barbarity of the age. By this &s;avage act the Syracu&s;ans tarni&s;hed the glory they had acquired by the gallant defence of their city, and the &s;ignal victory they had won.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, indeed, that Gylippus, and even many of the Syracu&s;ans them&s;elves, did all they could to &s;ave the lives of the Athenian gene|rals; but the great body of the people, egged on by their orators, and particularly by Diocles, one of their mo&s;t popular leaders, could be &s;atisfied
<PB N="99" REF="109">
with nothing le&s;s than the blood of the&s;e two illu&s;tri|ous men. The fate of Nicias is the more to be la|mented, as no man was ever more remarkable for humanity and good-nature; and though he headed this expedition in obedience to the commands of his countrymen, yet he did every thing in his power to prevent them from undertaking it. Demo&s;t|henes too was a man of &s;o re&s;pectable a character, that the famous orator of the &s;ame name, many years after, valued him&s;elf on account of his being of the &s;ame family.</P>
<P>As to the pri&s;oners, they were &s;hut up in the dungeons of Syracu&s;e, where many of them peri&s;h|ed through want and bad treatment: and tho&s;e that &s;urvived being afterwards &s;old for &s;laves, recom|mended them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly to their ma&s;ters by their mode&s;t, prudent, and ingenuous behaviour, that many of them &s;oon obtained their liberty; and &s;ome of them even owed that favour, to their being able to repeat the fine&s;t &s;cenes of Euripides's tra|gedies, of which the Sicilians were pa&s;&s;ionately fond: &s;o that when they returned to their own country, they went and &s;aluted the poet as their de|liverer, and informed him of the great advantage they had derived from their being acquainted with his ver&s;es.</P>
<P>The Athenians were &s;o little prepared to receive the news of this defeat, or rather, indeed, they were &s;o confident of receiving news of a contrary nature, that they condemned to death the man that fir&s;t brought the intelligence; but when they found, that matters were really wor&s;e than fame had reported, they were at once overwhelmed with grief and de&s;pair. They had never, indeed, been reduced to &s;o deplorable a condition as they were now, having neither hor&s;e, foot, money, &s;hips, nor mariners: in a word, they &s;unk into the deepe&s;t de&s;pondency, and expected every moment, that the
<PB N="100" REF="110">
enemy, elate with &s;o great a victory, and &s;trength|ened by the junction of the allies, would come and invade Athens both by &s;ea and land with all the forces of Peloponne&s;us. Cicero therefore had rea|&s;on to &s;ay, when &s;peaking of the battles in the har|bour of Syracu&s;e, that it was there the troops of Athens, as well as their gallies, were ruined and &s;unk, and that in this harbour the power and glory of the Athenians were mi&s;erably &s;hipwrecked.</P>
<P>The Athenians, however, did not &s;uffer them|&s;elves to be wholly dejected, but a&s;&s;umed courage from de&s;pair. They rai&s;ed money on every &s;ide for building new &s;hips; they retrenched all &s;uperfluous expences; and they e&s;tabli&s;hed a council of old men, to examine every matter before it was brought into the a&s;&s;embly of the people. In a word, they took every &s;tep that could po&s;&s;ibly tend to retrieve their ruined affairs, or at lea&s;t prevent them from growing wor&s;e than they were. But nothing could re&s;tore them to their former &s;plendid condition; for from this time forward, the Athenians pre&s;ent us with a very different picture from what they have hitherto done. We are no longer to behold them making a figure in arts and arms, giving le&s;&s;ons in politene&s;s, humanity, philo&s;ophy, and war, to all the nations around, and aiming at the erection of an empire, which, if once thoroughly e&s;tabli&s;hed, would have bid defiance to all the neighbouring &s;tates. In&s;tead of a&s;piring to the conque&s;t of their neighbours, they are now content with defending their own territories at home: in&s;tead of directing the councils, and conducing the confederate armies of Greece, they now confine all their attention to their own private affairs; they in a manner become annihilated; they fade from the eye of the hi&s;torian; and other nations, who&s;e names have hitherto been &s;carcely mentioned, emerge from ob&s;curity.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="111">It was in this deplorable &s;tate of the Athenian af|fairs, that Alcibiades made propo&s;als of returning home, provided the admini&s;tration of the republic were put into the hands of the great and powerful, and not left to the populace, who had expelled him. In or|der to induce his countrymen to agree to the&s;e terms, he offered to procure them not only the favour of Ti&s;&s;aphernes, the king of Per&s;ia's lieutenant, with whom he had taken refuge, but even that of the king him&s;elf, upon condition they would aboli&s;h the democracy or popular government; becau&s;e the king, he &s;aid, would place more confidence in the engagements of the nobility, than in tho&s;e of the giddy and capricious multitude. The chief man who oppo&s;ed his return was Phrynicus, one of the generals; who, in order to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, &s;ent word to A&s;tyochus, the Lacedaemonian general, that Alcibiades was u&s;ing his utmo&s;t endeavours to engage Ti&s;&s;aphernes in the Athenian intere&s;t. He offered, further, to betray to him the whole army and navy of the Athenians. But his trea&s;onable practices being all detected by the good under&s;tanding between Alcibiades and A&s;tyochus, he was &s;tript of his office, and afterwards &s;tabbed in the market|place.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Athenians proceeded to com|plete that change of government which had been propo&s;ed to them by Alcibiades; the democracy be|gan to be aboli&s;hed in &s;everal of the &s;maller cities, and &s;oon after the &s;cheme was carried boldly into execution in Athens it&s;elf by Py&s;ander, who had the chief hand in this tran&s;action. To give a new form to the government, he cau&s;ed ten commi&s;&s;aries, with ab&s;olute power, to be appointed, who were, how|ever, at a certain fixed time, to give the people an account of what they had done. At the expiration of that term the general a&s;&s;embly was &s;ummoned, in which the fir&s;t re&s;olution was, that every one
<PB N="102" REF="112">
&s;hould be admitted to make &s;uch propo&s;als as he thought fit, without being liable to any accu&s;ation, or con&s;equent penalty, for infringing the law. It was afterwards decreed, that a new council &s;hould be formed, with full power to admini&s;ter the public affairs, and to elect new magi&s;trates. For this pur|po&s;e five pre&s;idents were e&s;tabli&s;hed, who nominated one hundred per&s;ons, including them&s;elves. Each of the&s;e cho&s;e and a&s;&s;ociated three more at his own plea&s;ure, which made in all four hundred, in whom an ab&s;olute power was lodged. But to amu&s;e the people, and gratify them with the &s;hadow of a po|pular government, whil&s;t they in&s;tituted a real oli|garchy, it was &s;aid, that the four hundred would call a council of five thou&s;and citizens to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, whenever they &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary. The a&s;&s;em|blies of the people, indeed, were &s;till held as u&s;ual; but nothing was done in them but by order of the four hundred. In this manner were the Athenians deprived of their liberty, after having enjoyed it almo&s;t a hundred years, from the time of de&s;troying the tyranny of the Pi&s;i&s;tratidae.</P>
<P>This decree having pa&s;&s;ed without oppo&s;ition, after the breaking up of the a&s;&s;embly, the four hundred, armed with daggers, and attended by an hundred and twenty young men, whom they made u&s;e of when any emergency required it, entered the &s;enate, and compelled the &s;enators to retire, after having paid them the arrears of their &s;alaries that were &s;till due. They elected new magi&s;trates out of their own body, ob&s;erving the u&s;ual ceremonies upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. They did not think proper to re|call tho&s;e who had been bani&s;hed, le&s;t they &s;hould authorize the return of Alcibiades, who&s;e uncon|troulable &s;pirit they dreaded, and who would &s;oon have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the government. Abu|&s;ing their power in a tyrannical manner, they put &s;ome to death; others they bani&s;hed, and confi&s;cated
<PB N="103" REF="113">
their e&s;tates with impunity. All who ventured to oppo&s;e this change, or even to complain of it, were butchered upon fal&s;e pretexts, and tho&s;e were inti|midated who demanded ju&s;tice of the murderers. The four hundred, &s;oon after their e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;ent ten deputies to Samos for the army's approba|tion of their conduct.</P>
<P>The army, in the mean time, which was at Samos, prote&s;ted again&s;t the&s;e proceedings in the city; and, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of Thra&s;ybulus, recalled Alcibi|ades, and created him general, with full power to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l directly to the Pyraeus, and cru&s;h this new ty|ranny. Alcibiades, however, would not give way to this ra&s;h opinion, but went fir&s;t to &s;hew him&s;elf to Ti&s;&s;aphernes, and let him know, that it was now in his power to treat with him, either as a friend or an enemy. By which means he awed the Athenians with Ti&s;&s;aphernes, and Ti&s;&s;aphernes with the Athe|nians. When, afterwards, the four hundred &s;ent to Samos to vindicate their proceedings, the army was for putting the me&s;&s;engers to death, and per&s;i&s;ted in the de&s;ign upon the Pyraeus; but Alcibiades, by oppo&s;ing it, manife&s;tly &s;aved the commonwealth.</P>
<P>Mean while the innovation in Athens had occa|&s;ioned &s;uch factions and tumults, that the four hun|dred were more intent upon providing for their own &s;afety, than carrying on the war: and, the better to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e, they fortified that part of the Pyraeus which commands the mouth of the haven, and re&s;olved, in ca&s;e of extremity, rather to let in the Lacedaemonians, than expo&s;e their per&s;ons to the fury of their fellow-citizens. The Spartans took occa&s;ion, from the&s;e di&s;turbances, to hover about with forty-two gallies, under the conduct of Hege&s;andrides; and the Athenians, with thirty-&s;ix under Timochares, were forced to engage them, but lo&s;t part of their fleet, and the re&s;t were di&s;|per&s;ed.
<PB N="104" REF="114">
To add to which, all Euboea, except Oreus, revolted to the Peloponne&s;ians.</P>
<P>This failure of &s;ucce&s;s gave the fini&s;hing blow to the power of the four hundred. The Athenians, without delay, depo&s;ed them, as the authors of all the calamities under which they groaned. Alcibiades was recalled by unanimous con&s;ent, and earne&s;tly &s;olicited to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the city. But judging that if he returned imme|diately to Athens, he &s;hould owe his recall to the compa&s;&s;ion and favour of the people, he re&s;olved to render his return glorious and triumphant, and to de&s;erve it by &s;ome con&s;iderable exploit.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, leaving Samos with a &s;mall number of &s;hips, he cruized about the i&s;lands of Cos and Onidos; and having learnt that Mindarus, the Spartan admiral, had &s;ailed to the Helle&s;pont with his whole fleet, and that the Athenians were in pur|&s;uit of him, he &s;teered that way with the utmo&s;t ex|pedition to &s;upport them, and arrived happily with his eighteen ve&s;&s;els at the time the fleets were en|gaged near Abydos, in a battle which la&s;ted till night, without any advantage on either &s;ide.

<P>Alcibiades, after this victory, went to vi&s;it Ti&s;&s;a|phernes, who was &s;o far from receiving him as he expected, that he immediately cau&s;ed him to be &s;eized, and &s;ent away to Sardis, telling him that he had orders from the king to make war upon the

Athenians; but the truth is, he was afraid of being accu&s;ed to his ma&s;ter by the Peloponne&s;ians, and thought, by this act of inju&s;tice, to purge him&s;elf from all former imputations. Alcibiades, after thirty days, made his e&s;cape to Clazomenae, and &s;oon after bore down upon the Peloponne&s;ian fleet, which rode at anchor before the port of Cyzicus. With twenty of his be&s;t &s;hips he broke through the enemy, pur|&s;ued tho&s;e who abandoned their ve&s;&s;els and fled to land, and made a great &s;laughter. The Athenians took the enemy's whole fleet, and made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of Cyzicus, while Mingimis, the Lacedae|monian general, was found among the number of the &s;lain.</P>
<P>Alcibiades well knew how to make u&s;e of the ad|vantage he had gained; and, at the head of his vic|torious troops, took, &s;everal cities which had revolted from the Athenians. Calcedon, Salymbria, and Byzantium, were among the number. Thus flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;eemed to de&s;ire nothing more than to be once more &s;een by his countrymen, as his pre&s;ence would be a triumph to his friends, and an in&s;ult to his enemies. He accordingly &s;et &s;ail for Athens. Be&s;ides the &s;hips covered with bucklers and &s;poils of all &s;orts, in the manner of trophies, a great number of ve&s;&s;els were al&s;o towed after him by way of triumph: he di&s;played likewi&s;e the en&s;igns and ornaments of tho&s;e he had burnt, which were more than the others, the whole amounting to about two hundred &s;hips.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that reflecting on what had been done again&s;t him, upon approaching the port, he was &s;track with &s;ome apprehen&s;ions, and was afraid to quit his ve&s;&s;el, till he &s;aw from the deck a great number of his friends and relations, who were come to the &s;hore to receive him, and earne&s;tly entreated him to land. As &s;oon as he was landed, the multi|tude, who came out to meet him, fixed their eyes
<PB N="106" REF="116">
upon him, thronged about him, &s;aluted him with loud acclamations, and crowned him with garlands. He received their congratulations with great &s;atisfaction; he de&s;ired to be di&s;charged from his former condem|nation, and obtained from the prie&s;ts an ab&s;olution from all their former denunciations.</P>
<P>Yet, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e triumphs, the real power of Athens was now no more; the &s;trength of the &s;tate was gone; and even the pa&s;&s;ion for liberty was lo&s;t in the common degeneracy of the times. Many of the meaner &s;ort of people earne&s;tly de|&s;ired Alcibiades to take upon him the &s;overeign power, and to &s;et him&s;elf above the reach of envy, by &s;ecuring all authority in his own per&s;on. But the great were neither &s;o warm nor &s;o injudicious in their expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude. They contented them&s;elves with appointing him generali&s;&s;imo of all their forces; they granted him whatever he de|manded, and gave him for colleagues the generals mo&s;t agreeable to him. He &s;et &s;ail accordingly with an hundred &s;hips, and &s;teered for the i&s;land of Andros that had revolted, where having defeated the inhabitants, he went from thence to Samos, intending to make that the &s;eat of war. In the mean time the Lacedaemonians, alarmed at his &s;uc|ce&s;s, made choice of a general every way qualified to make head again&s;t him. This was Ly&s;ander, who, though born of the highe&s;t family, had been enured to hard&s;hips from his earlie&s;t youth, and was &s;trongly attached to the manners and di&s;cipline of his country. He was brave, ambitious, cir|cum&s;pect, but, at the &s;ame time, cunning, crafty and deceitful; and the&s;e latter qualities ran &s;o much through his whole life, that it was u&s;ually &s;aid of him, that he cheated children with foul play, and men with oaths: and it is reported to have been a maxim of his, that when the lion's &s;trength fails, we mu&s;t make u&s;e of the &s;ubtilty of the fox.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="117">Ly&s;ander having brought his army to Ephe&s;us, gave orders for a&s;&s;embling &s;hips of burden from all parts, and erected a dock for the building of gal|lies; he made the ports free for merchants, and by encouraging trade of every kind, he laid the founda|tion of that &s;plendour and magnificence, to which Ephe&s;us afterwards attained. Meanwhile receiving advice that Cyrus, the king of Per&s;ia's &s;on, was ar|rived at Sardis, he went thither to pay him a vi&s;it, and at the &s;ame time to complain to him of the conduct of Ti&s;&s;aphernes, who&s;e duplicity, he &s;aid, had proved fatal to their common cau&s;e. Cyrus was &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to any complaints again&s;t Ti&s;&s;aphernes, to whom he him&s;elf had a per|&s;onal enmity, and he therefore came readily into the views of Ly&s;ander, and at his reque&s;t increa&s;ed the pay of the &s;eamen. This la&s;t circum&s;tance had a &s;ur|pri&s;ing effect. It in&s;tantly almo&s;t unmanned the gallies of the Athenians, and &s;upplied the Lacedae|monian fleet with plenty of &s;ailors, who, without enquiring into the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e on either &s;ide, went over to that party which gave the be&s;t pay.</P>
<P>Nor was this the only misfortune which the Athe|nians now met with. For Alcibiades being obliged to leave the fleet, in order to rai&s;e the &s;upplies, gave the command of it to Antiochus with &s;trict orders not to attack, or engage the enemy in his ab&s;ence. But Antiochus de&s;irous of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by &s;ome great action before the return of Alcibiades, &s;ailed away directly for Ephe&s;us, and u&s;ed every art to provoke the enemy to an engage|ment. Ly&s;ander at fir&s;t contented him&s;elf with &s;ending out a few &s;hips to repel his in&s;ults; but the Athenian gallies advancing to &s;upport their com|mander, other Lacedaemonian ve&s;&s;els likewi&s;e came on, till at la&s;t both fleets arrived, and the engage|ment became general. After a &s;harp &s;truggle, Ly|&s;ander
<PB N="108" REF="118">
obtained the victory, having killed Antiochus, and taken fifteen of the Athenian gallies. It was in vain that Alcibiades &s;oon after came up to the relief of his friends; it was in vain that he offered to renew the combat; Ly&s;ander was too wi&s;e to hazard the advantage he had gained by venturing on a &s;econd engagement.</P>
<P>This misfortune proved fatal to the reputation of Alcibiades, though indeed it was his own glory that ruined him; for the people, from his unin|terrupted &s;ucce&s;s, had conceived &s;uch a high opi|nion of his abilites, that they thought it impo&s;&s;ible for him to fail in any thing he &s;eriou&s;ly undertook: and they therefore now began to que&s;tion his in|tegrity, and deprived him of the command of the army.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time Callicratidas was appointed to &s;ucceed Ly&s;ander, who&s;e year was expired. This man was equal to his predece&s;&s;or in courage, and greatly &s;uperior in probity and ju&s;tice, being as open and ingenuous as the other was cunning and crafty. His fir&s;t attempt was again&s;t Methymna in Le&s;bos, which he took by &s;torm. He then threatened Conon, who had &s;ucceeded Alcibiades, that he would make him leave off <HI>debauching</HI> the &s;ea; and accordingly &s;oon after pur&s;ued him into the port of Mitylene with an hundred and &s;eventy &s;ail, took thirty of his &s;hips, and be&s;ieged him in the town, from which he cut off all provi&s;ions. He &s;oon after took ten &s;hips more out of twelve, that were coming to the relief of Conon. Then hearing that the Athenians had fitted out their whole &s;trength, con&s;i&s;ting of an hundred and fifty &s;ail, he left fifty of his &s;hips under Etonicus, to carry on the &s;iege of Mitylene, and with an hundred and twenty more met the Athenians at Arginu&s;ae, over-again&s;t Le&s;bos. His pilot advi&s;ing him to retreat becau&s;e the enemy were &s;uperior in number,
<PB N="109" REF="119">
"Sparta," replied he, <Q REND="inline">"will be never the wor&s;e inhabited though I &s;hould be &s;lain."</Q> The fight ac|cordingly was immediately begun, and was main|tained for a long time with equal bravery on both &s;ides, till at la&s;t the &s;hip of Callicratidas, charging through the mid&s;t of the enemy, was &s;unk, and the re&s;t fled. The Peloponne&s;ians lo&s;t about &s;eventy &s;ail, and the Athenians twenty-five, with mo&s;t of the men in them.</P>
<P>The Athenian admirials, in&s;tead of being re|warded for the victory they had gained, were &s;e|verely puni&s;hed for a &s;uppo&s;ed neglect of duty. They were accu&s;ed of not having done their utmo&s;t to &s;ave their men who had been &s;hipwrecked; and they were accordingly &s;ent home in irons, to an|&s;wer for their conduct. They alledged in their de|fence, that they were pur&s;uing the enemy; and, at the &s;ame time, gave orders about taking up the men to tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it more peculiarly was; par|ticularly to Theramenes, who now appeared again&s;t them; but yet that their orders could not be exe|cuted, on account of a violent &s;torm which hap|pened at that time. This plea &s;eemed &s;o &s;atisfactory, that &s;everal &s;tood up and offered to bail them: but, in another a&s;&s;embly, the popular incendiaries de|manded ju&s;tice, and &s;o awed the judges, that So|crates was the only man who had courage enough to declare, that he would do nothing contrary to law, and accordingly refu&s;ed to act. After a long debate, eight of the ten were condemned, and &s;ix of them were put to death; among whom was Pericles, &s;on of the great &s;tate&s;man of the &s;ame name. He maintained, that they had failed in no|thing of their duty, as they had given orders for we dead bodies being taken up; that if any one were guilty, it was Theramenes him&s;elf, who being charged with the&s;e orders, had neglected to put them in execution: but that he accu&s;ed nobody,
<PB N="110" REF="120">
and that the tempe&s;t, which came on unexpectedly at the very in&s;tant, was a &s;ufficient apology, and entirely freed the accu&s;ed from all kind of guilt. He demanded, that a whole day &s;hould be allowed them to make their defence, a favour not denied to the mo&s;t criminal, and that they &s;hould be tried &s;eparately. He repre&s;ented, that they were not in the lea&s;t obliged to precipitate a &s;entence, in which the lives of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious citizens were con|cerned; that it was in &s;ome mea&s;ure attacking the gods, to make them re&s;pon&s;ible for the winds and weather; that they could not, without the mo&s;t flagrant ingratitude and inju&s;tice, inflict death upon the conquerors, to whom they ought rather to decree crowns and honours, or give up the de|fenders of their country to the rage of tho&s;e who envied them; that if they did &s;o, their unju&s;t judg|ment will be followed by a &s;udden, but vain repen|tance, which would leave behind it the &s;harpe&s;t re|mor&s;e, and cover them with eternal infamy.</P>
<P>Among the number al&s;o was Diomedon, a per|&s;on equally eminent for his valour and his probity: as he was carrying to execution he demanded to be heard,&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"Athenians," &s;aid he,"I wi&s;h the &s;en|tence you have pa&s;&s;ed upon us may not prove the misfortune of the republic; but I have one fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur to a&s;k of you in behalf of my colleagues and my&s;elf, which is, to acquit us before the gods of the vows we made to them for you and our&s;elves, as we are not in a condition to di&s;charge them; for it is to their aid, invoked before the battle, we acknow|ledge, that we are indebted for the victory gained by us over the enemy."</Q> There was not a good citizen that did not melt into tears at this di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o full of piety and religion, and behold with &s;ur|prize the moderation of a per&s;on, who &s;eeing him|&s;elf unju&s;tly condemned, did not however, expre&s;s the lea&s;t re&s;entment, nor even utter a complaint

again&s;t his judges, but was &s;olely intent, in favour of an ungrateful country which had doomed them to peri&s;h, upon what it owed to the gods in com|mon with them for the victory they had lately ob|tained.</P>
<P>This complication of inju&s;tice and ingratitude gave the fini&s;hing blow to the affairs of the Athe|nians: they &s;truggled for a while after the defeat at Syracu&s;e, but from this time forward they ra|pidly declined, though &s;eemingly in the arms of victory. The enemy, after their defeat, had once more recour&s;e to Ly&s;ander, who had &s;o often led them to conque&s;t; in him they placed their chief confidence, and earne&s;tly &s;olicited his return. The Lacedaemonians therefore, to gratify their allies, and yet to ob&s;erve their laws, which forbade that honour being twice conferred on the &s;ame per&s;on, &s;ent him with an inferior title, but with the power of admiral. Thus appointed, Ly&s;ander &s;ailed to|wards the Helle&s;pont, and laid &s;iege to Lamp&s;acus, which he took by &s;torm, and abandoned it to the mercy of the &s;oldiers. The Athenians, who fol|lowed him clo&s;e, upon the news of his &s;ucce&s;s, &s;teered forward towards Ole&s;tus, and from thence &s;ailing along the coa&s;t, halted over again&s;t the enemy at Aegos Potamos, a place fatal to the Athenians.</P>
<P>The Helle&s;pont is not above two thou&s;and paces broad in that place. The two fleets &s;eeing them|&s;elves &s;o near each other, expected only to re&s;t that day, and hoped to come to an engagement on the next. But Ly&s;ander had another de&s;ign in view. He commanded the &s;eamen and pilots to go on board their gallies, and hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s, as if they were really to fight next morning. He likewi&s;e commanded the land army to be drawn up in battle-array upon the coa&s;t, and to wait his or|ders in profound &s;ilence. On the morning, as &s;oon
<PB N="112" REF="122">
as the &s;un was ri&s;en, the Athenians rowed towards them with their whole fleet, and offered them bat|tle. This, however, Ly&s;ander did not think pro|per to accept, even though his &s;hips were ranged in perfect order, with their heads towards the enemy. The Athenians, a&s;cribing this conduct to fear or cowardice, retired in the evening, and, thinking they were in no danger, went a&s;hore to amu&s;e and regale them&s;elves, as if no enemy had been nigh. Of this la&s;t circum&s;tance Ly&s;ander was fully in|formed, by &s;ome gallies he &s;ent out to ob&s;erve their motions. To throw them, therefore, into &s;till greater &s;ecurity, and put them more off their guard, he allowed the three following days to pa&s;s in the &s;ame manner, during each of which the Athenians came regularly up, and offered him battle, which he as regularly per&s;i&s;ted to decline.</P>
<P>In the mean time Alcibiades, who &s;ince his di&s;|grace had lived in Thrace, and was much better acquainted with the character of the Lacedaemonians, and particularly with that of Ly&s;ander, than the pre&s;ent Athenian generals, came and warned them of their danger: he even offered, with a body of Thracian troops, to attack the enemy by land, and thus force them to a battle. But the Athenian ge|nerals, jealous of their honour, and thinking, that, if the event proved &s;ucce&s;sful, Alcibiades would en|joy all the glory, and, if otherwi&s;e, the whole blame would fall upon them, not only refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but even rejected his &s;alutary advice. The con&s;equence was, that, on the evening of the fifth day, when they had retired as u&s;ual, and their men were all gone on &s;hore, and di&s;per&s;ed up and down the country, Ly&s;ander came &s;uddenly upon them with his whole force, and attacking them in this unprepared and defencele&s;s condition, he ea&s;ily made a capture of their whole fleet, except nine gallies, (including the &s;acred &s;hip) with which
<PB N="113" REF="123">
Conon contrived to e&s;cape to Cyprus, where he took refuge with Evagoras. This was one of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;trokes of general&s;hip that ever was performed in ancient, or perhaps even in modern times; for by it Ly&s;ander, in the &s;pace of an hour, put end to a war, that had already la&s;ted twenty-&s;even years, and but for him would probably have la&s;ted much longer.</P>
<P>The number of pri&s;oners amounted to three thou&s;and, and the fate of the&s;e is a &s;hocking proof of the barbarous manners of the age; for it cannot be denied that, with all their attainments in elo|quence and poetry, and the other arts that depend upon the imagination, the Greeks and Romans were greatly inferior to the moderns, not merely in their knowledge of nature, but in civility, politene&s;s, and in every thing that tends to humanize the mind of man. The fact is, the&s;e unhappy men were in|&s;tantly put to death, though this was &s;aid to be only by way of retaliation; for that the Athenians had cau&s;ed to be thrown down a precipice all the men that were taken in two Lacedaemonian gallies, and had likewi&s;e made a decree for cutting off the thumb of the right hand of all the pri&s;oners of war, in order to di&s;able them from handling the pike, and that they might be fit only to &s;erve at the oar. Philocles, the chief author both of this barbarous act and this &s;evere decree, was now called upon to &s;hew what he could urge in his defence, when he haughtily re|plied,&mdash;"Accu&s;e not people of crimes who have no judges; but as you are victors, u&s;e your right, and do by us as we had done by you if we had con|quered." The only per&s;on that was &s;aved out of the whole number was Adamantus, who had op|po&s;ed the decree.</P>
<P>The Athenians were no &s;ooner informed of the entire defeat of their army, than they were over|wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lmed with con&s;ternation. They already thought
<PB N="114" REF="124">
they &s;aw Ly&s;ander at their gates, nor was it long be|fore he came there. But before he did &s;o, he com|manded all the Athenians, that were &s;cattered up and down in different parts of Greece, to take &s;helter in Athens on pain of death. This he did with a de&s;ign &s;o to croud the city, that he might be able &s;oon to reduce it by famine. And indeed, in a little time, he actually &s;o reduced it. For Agis and Pau&s;anias, the two kings of Sparta, having be&s;ieged it by land, and Ly&s;ander him&s;elf blocking it up by &s;ea, the wretched Athenians, after undergoing the mo&s;t in|tolerable hard&s;hips, were driven to &s;uch extremity, that they &s;ent deputies to Agis, with offers of aban|doning all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, their city and port only excepted. The haughty Lacedaemonian referred their deputies to the &s;tate it&s;elf, and when the&s;e &s;uppliants made known their commi&s;&s;ion to the Ephori, they were ordered to depart, and come again with other propo&s;als if they expected peace.</P>
<P>At length Theramenes, an Athenian, undertook to manage the treaty with Ly&s;ander; and, after a conference which la&s;ted three months, he received full powers to treat at Lacedaemon. When he, attended by nine others, arrived before the Ephori, &s;ome of the confederates repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of de&s;troying Athens entirely, without li&s;tening to any further propo&s;als. But the Lace|daemonians told them, that they would not con|&s;ent to the de&s;truction of a city, which had pre|&s;erved the general independence of Greece in the mo&s;t critical juncture, and they therefore agreed to a peace upon the&s;e conditions: that the long walls and fortifications of the Piraeus &s;hould be demo|li&s;hed; that they &s;hould deliver up all their &s;hips but twelve; that they &s;hould re&s;tore their exiles; that they &s;hould make a league offen&s;ive and de|fen&s;ive with the Lacedaemonians, and &s;erve them in all their expeditions both by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="125">Theramenes being returned with the articles to Athens, was a&s;ked why he acted in a manner &s;o contrary to the intentions of Themi&s;tocles, and gave tho&s;e walls into the hands of the Lacedaemo|nians, which he built in defiance of them? <Q REND="inline">"I have my eye," &s;aid he, "upon Themi&s;tocles's de|&s;ign; he rai&s;ed the&s;e walls for the pre&s;ervation of the city, and I for the very &s;ame rea&s;on would have them de&s;troyed; for, if walls only &s;ecure a city, Sparta, which has none, is in a very bad con|dition."</Q> Such an an&s;wer would not have &s;atisfied the Athenians at any other time; but being now reduced to the la&s;t extremity, it did not admit of a long debate whether they &s;hould accept the treaty. At la&s;t Ly&s;ander, coming to the Piraeus, demoli&s;hed the walls with great &s;olemnity, and all the in&s;ulting triumphs of mu&s;ic; and thus was a period put to the famous Peleponne&s;ian war, the longe&s;t, the mo&s;t expen&s;ive, and the mo&s;t bloody, in which Greece had ever been engaged.</P>
<P>It would be unpardonable in us not to pay that tribute of gratitude and re&s;pect, which is due to the memory of tho&s;e exalted geniu&s;es, who&s;e labours adorned the nations of their own time, and have poli&s;hed and humanized all &s;ucceeding ages. Wars and political conte&s;ts &s;erve but to de|populate the earth, or to fill the minds of men with animo&s;ity and hate; while the labours of the hi&s;torian, the fancies of the poet, and the di&s;cove|ries of the philo&s;opher, enlighten the under&s;tanding, meliorate the heart, and teach us fortitude and re|&s;ignation. Such peaceful and improving arts well de&s;erve our notice. More e&s;pecially does the cul|tivation of them in Greece de&s;erve our attention, as many of the writers of that country were re|nowned for military and political, as as well as li|terary accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="126">Of Homer it were unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much, his merit being well known. It is not probable, that he was the fir&s;t of the Grecian poets.

<P>About the beginning of the war which preceded the peace concluded between the Athenians and Lacedaemonians for fifty years, died Ae&s;chylus, the Athenian dramatic writer.

It was Ae&s;chylus who exchanged the cart of The&s;pis for a theatre; who introduced a variety of performers, each taking a part in the re|pre&s;entation of &s;ome great action, and dre&s;&s;ed in a manner &s;uited to his character. The &s;tyle of Ae&s;|chylus is pompous, and &s;ometimes &s;ublime, but far
<PB N="117" REF="127">
from being harmonious. He is frequently too &s;o very ob&s;cure, that it is no ea&s;y matter to find out his meaning. The chief object of his pieces is <HI>terror</HI>; and, to do him ju&s;tice, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, that few dramatic writers have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him in exciting that pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>During that period, in which Greece was &s;o much di&s;tracted by the Peloponne&s;ian war, there flouri&s;hed Sophocles, Euripedes, Ari&s;tophanes, &amp;c. among the poets; Herodotus and Thucydides among the hi&s;torians; and Socrates among the philo&s;ophers.</P>
<P>Sophocles had applied &s;o inten&s;ely to the &s;tudy of tragedy, when a young man, that his fir&s;t piece was judged not inferior to the very be&s;t of tho&s;e of Ae&s;chylus. Both the&s;e poets were &s;tately in their manner, but Ae&s;chylus was the more &s;ublime. That advantage, however, was more than coun|terbalanced by the ver&s;atility of Sophocles's genius, and by his &s;uperior per&s;picuity and eloquence. He was al&s;o more &s;ucce&s;sful than his ma&s;ter in his ap|peal to the pa&s;&s;ions; and though he did not harrow up the brea&s;t by <HI>terror,</HI> he &s;oftened it more by <HI>pity,</HI> and acquired, of cour&s;e, the reputation of being a more amiable and polite writer. Sophocles was likewi&s;e much more happy than his predece&s;&s;or in the conduct of his plots. He made them more inter|e&s;ting by being more artful. He al&s;o contrived to make the performances of the chorus bear a rela|tion to the main action, and &s;o rendered the whole entire. He wrote a hundred and twenty tragedies, of which &s;even only remain. He lived to the age of 85, and then is &s;aid to have died of joy for the &s;ucce&s;s of his la&s;t piece, as Ae&s;chylus is reported to have done of grief for being foiled by him in his fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Euripides, the rival of Sophocles, aimed not at the lofty &s;trains of Ae&s;chylus, or of his great com|petitor.
<PB N="118" REF="128">
He is more &s;ententious and moral than either of them, and &s;eemed to have as &s;trong a de|&s;ire to in&s;truct mankind, as to obtain their applau&s;e. Correctne&s;s and elegance were the qualities of &s;tyle which he appears to have admired. He is le&s;s artful and magnificent than Sophocles, but then he is more natural and more u&s;eful. We have already mentioned a circum&s;tance much to his honour, the emancipation of many of the Athenians who were made pri&s;oners at Syracu&s;e, becau&s;e they were able to repeat &s;ome of his beautiful ver&s;es.</P>
<P>While tragedy was improving in the hands of Sophocles and Euripedes, comedy was advancing under the guidance of Eupolis, Cratinus, and Ari&s;tophanes. But the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed of this kind was Ari&s;tophanes. At the &s;ame time that he entertained the Athenians with his plea&s;antry, he la&s;hed them with his &s;atire. True it is, he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s much of that fine raillery, which has given &s;o &s;mooth, and yet &s;o &s;harp an edge to modern comedy: but then he had fire and &s;trength; and as he introduced his characters by their real names, occupations, &amp;c. his performances were of|ten more reli&s;hed, and, very probably, more u&s;eful than tho&s;e of the tragedians.</P>
<P>As to hi&s;tory, Herodotus is con&s;idered as the fa|ther of that &s;pecies of compo&s;ition in Greece. He wrote the hi&s;tory of the wars between the Greeks and Per&s;ians, and gave a detail of the affairs of al|mo&s;t all other nations, from the reign of Cyrus to that of Xerxes. His work con&s;i&s;ts of nine books. It is clothed in the Ionic dialect, and is a perfect model of &s;implicity and elegance.</P>
<P>Thucydides is e&s;teemed a more able writer than even Herodotus. He wants, indeed, that native elegance for which his predece&s;&s;or is admired, but then he is more judicious and energetic. He wrote the hi&s;tory of the Peloponne&s;ian war.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="129">Of Socrates, Plato, Ari&s;totle, Demo&s;thenes, and other illu&s;trious Grecian writers and philo&s;ophers, mention is made in the different parts of this work.

<HEAD>CHAP. X. FROM THE DEMOLITION OF THE ATHENIAN POWER, TO THE DEATH OF SOCRATES.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Lacedaemonians would not con|&s;ent to the entire de&s;truction of Athens, as they would not be guilty, they &s;aid, of putting out one of the eyes of Greece, yet they not only re|duced it to the lowe&s;t condition in point of politi|cal con&s;equence, but even altered the form of its government; for they compelled the people to aboli&s;h the democracy, and &s;ubmit to the govern|ment of thirty men, who were commonly known by the name of the thirty tyrants. The Greeks, indeed, were &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to give that name to men of virtuous characters; but the&s;e rulers of Athens, who were the mere creatures of Ly&s;an|der, appear to have de&s;erved, in every re&s;pect, the mo&s;t opprobrious appellation. In&s;tead of com|piling and publi&s;hing a more perfect body of laws, which was the pretence for their being cho&s;en, they began to exerci&s;e their power of life and death; and though they appointed a &s;enate, and other magi&s;trates, they made no farther u&s;e of them than to confirm their own authority, and &s;ee their
<PB N="120" REF="130" MS="y">
commands executed. At fir&s;t, it is true, they pro|ceeded with &s;ome caution, and condemned only the mo&s;t profligate &s;ort of citizens, viz. &s;uch as lived by informing and giving evidence again&s;t their neighbours; but this was only to blind the eyes of the populace; their real de&s;ign was to make them&s;elves ab&s;olute; and as they well knew, that this could not be done without a foreign power, they next contrived to have a guard &s;ent them from Sparta. This guard was commanded by one Callibius, whom they &s;oon won over to their de|&s;igns; and from this time forward they proceeded to act without controul, filling the city with the blood of tho&s;e, who, on account of their riches, intere&s;t, or good qualities, were mo&s;t likely to op|po&s;e them.</P>
<P>One of their fir&s;t acts of cruelty was to procure the death of Alcibiades, who had taken refuge in the dominions of Per&s;ia. This man, though driven from his country, did not cea&s;e to intere&s;t him&s;elf in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> welfare; and the tyrants dreading, that, by his popularity at Athens, where he was &s;till much beloved, he would thwart all their &s;chemes, en|treated the Lacedaemonians to rid them of &s;o for|midable an opponent. This reque&s;t the Lacedae|monians had the meanne&s;s to comply with, and ac|cordingly wrote to Pharnaba&s;us the Per&s;ian gover|nor, for that purpo&s;e; and he, in his turn, was no le&s;s ba&s;e and unprincipled, for, without having re|ceived any per&s;onal injury from Alcibiades, he rea|dily promi&s;ed to take him out of the way. The man|ner of this great man's death did not di&s;grace the high character for courage he had maintained during life. The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, &s;ent again&s;t him, were afraid to at|tack him openly. They, therefore, &s;urrounded the hou&s;e in which he was, and &s;et it on fire. Alci|biades forced his way through the flames, &s;word in hand, and drove the barbarians before him, not one
<PB N="121" REF="131">
of whom had the courage to oppo&s;e him; but all of them di&s;charging their darts and javelins upon him from a di&s;tance, he at la&s;t fell covered with wounds, and in&s;tantly expired. Timandra, his mi&s;tre&s;s, took up his body, and having covered and adorned it with the fine&s;t robes &s;he had, &s;he made as mag|nificent a funeral for it as her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances would allow. To what we have already &s;aid of Alcibiades it may not be improper to add, that his great popularity, wherever he re&s;ided, was princi|pally owing to the extreme ver&s;atility of his genius, and the &s;urpri&s;ing facility with which he accommo|dated him&s;elf to the manners and cu&s;toms of dif|ferent people; for in this re&s;pect no man ever ex|ceeded, or perhaps even equalled him. Plutarch &s;ays, that at Sparta he was hardy, frugal, and re|&s;erved; in Ionia luxurious, indolent, and gay; and when tran&s;acting affairs with the king of Per&s;ia's lieutenants, he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even the&s;e men them&s;elves in pomp and magnificence.</P>
<P>The tyrants, though ea&s;ed of their apprehen&s;ions from this quarter, began to dread an oppo&s;ition from another, that is from the general body of the people, whom they well knew to be di&s;&s;atisfied with their conduct; and they therefore inve&s;ted three thou&s;and citizens with &s;ome part of their power, and by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance kept the re&s;t in awe. En|couraged now by &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, they &s;oon proceeded to &s;till greater extremities than any they had hitherto ventured on; they agreed to &s;ingle out every one his man, to put him to death, and &s;eize their e&s;tates for the maintenance of their guard. Theramenes, one of their number, was the only man that was &s;truck with horror at their proceed|ings: Critias, therefore, the principal author of this dete&s;table re&s;olution, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake him out of the way, and he accordingly ac|cu&s;ed him to the &s;enate of endeavouring to &s;ubvert
<PB N="122" REF="132">
the government. Sentence of death was immediately pa&s;&s;ed upon him, and he was obliged to drink the juice of hemlock, the u&s;ual mode of execution at that time in Athens. Socrates, who&s;e di&s;ciple he had been, was the only per&s;on of the &s;enate who ventured to appear in his defence; he made an at|tempt to re&s;cue him out of the hands of the officer of ju&s;tice, and, after his execution, went about as it were in defiance of the thirty, exhorting and ani|mating the &s;enators and citizens again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The tyrants thus freed from the oppo&s;ition of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> colleague, who&s;e pre&s;ence alone was a continua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> reproach to them, &s;et no longer any bounds to their cruelty and rapacity.

<P>The Lacedaemonians, not content with &s;upport+ing the thirty tyrants in the exerci&s;e of their cru+elty, were unwilling to let any of the Athenian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> e&s;cape from their hands.

with his fellow-citizens, and the re&s;ult was, that &s;ome attempt, with whatever danger it might be attended, &s;hould certainly be made for re&s;toring the public liberty. Accordingly with a party of thirty men only, as Nepos &s;ays, but, as Xenophon more probably relates, of near &s;eventy, he &s;eized upon Phyle, a &s;trong ca&s;tle on the frontiers of At|tica. This enterprize alarmed the tyrants, who immediately marched out of Athens with their three thou&s;and followers, and their Spartan guard, and attempted the recovery of the place, but were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s. Finding they could not carry it by a &s;udden a&s;&s;ault, they re&s;olved upon a &s;iege; but not being &s;ufficiently provided for that purpo&s;e, and a great &s;now falling in the night, they were forced to retire the next day into the city, leaving only part of their guard to prevent any farther in||cur&s;ions into the country.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, Thra&s;ybulus no lon|ger kept upon the defen&s;ive, but marching out of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ple by night at the head of a thou&s;and men, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Pyraeus. The thirty flew thither with their troops, and a battle &s;ufficiently warm en|&s;ued; but as the &s;oldiers, on one &s;ide, fought with &s;pirit and ardour for their liberty, and, on the other, with indolence and neglect for the power of their oppre&s;&s;ors, the victory was not long doubtful, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut followed the better cau&s;e; the tyrants were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thrown; Critias was killed upon the &s;pot; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the re&s;t of the army were taking to flight, Thra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ybulus cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Wherefore do you fly from me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s from a victor, rather than a&s;&s;i&s;t me as the avenger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f your liberty? we are not enemies but fellow-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itizens; neither have we declared war again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty, but again&s;t the thirty tyrants."</Q> He entreated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em to remember, that they had the &s;ame origin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ountry, laws, and religion; he exhorted them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ty their exiled brethren, to re&s;tore to them their

<P>Though the government was thus altered, and the thirty deprived of their power, they &s;till had hopes of being re-in&s;tated in their former authority, and &s;ent deputies to Sparta to demand aid.

Artaxerxes carried his genero&s;ity to a &s;till greater, and even to an imprudent length; for he be&s;towed upon Cyrus the ab&s;olute command of all tho&s;e provinces that had been left him by the will of his father. Cyrus no &s;ooner found him&s;elf in this exalted &s;ituation, than he began to u&s;e every art for the accompli&s;hment of his ambitious project; and with this view he engaged in his &s;ervice a body of thirteen thou&s;and Greeks under the command of Clearchus, an able Lacedaemonian officer, who had been bani&s;hed his native country, and for &s;ome time re&s;ided at the court of Cyrus. The&s;e were joined by a great number of Per&s;ians from the provinces which Cyrus him&s;elf commanded, as well as from tho&s;e under the government of Ti&s;&s;aphernes, where &s;everal cities had revolted in his favour. The com|mon Grecians, however, were entire &s;trangers to the purpo&s;e for which they were enli&s;ted, nor was any one let into Cyrus's de&s;ign but Clearchus him|&s;elf. When the troops, therefore, began their march, and had advanced as far as Tar&s;us, the Greeks refu&s;ed to proceed any farther, rightly &s;u&s;|&s;pecting that they were intended again&s;t the king, and loudly exclaiming that they had not entered into the &s;ervice upon that condition. Clearchus had need of all his dexterity and addre&s;s to &s;tifle this commotion in its birth. At fir&s;t he made u&s;e of authority and force; but finding the&s;e had little effect, he de&s;i&s;ted from an open oppo&s;ition to the &s;entiments of the &s;oldiers: he even affected to enter into their views, and to &s;upport them with his ap|probation and credit. By this artful eva&s;ion he appea&s;ed the tumult, and made the men ea&s;y for the pre&s;ent; and they cho&s;e him and &s;ome others for their deputies. Cyrus, whom he had &s;ecretly apprized of every thing, made an&s;wer, that he was going to attack Abrocomas, his enemy, at twelve days march from thence, upon the Euphrates.
<PB N="126" REF="136">
When this an&s;wer was reported to them, though they plainly &s;aw again&s;t whom they were going, they re&s;olved to proceed, and only demanded an augmentation of their pay. Cyrus, in&s;tead of one daric a month to each &s;oldier, promi&s;ed to give them one and a half. And the more to ingratiate him&s;elf, when he was told, that two officers had de&s;erted from the army, and was advi&s;ed to pur&s;ue and put them to death, he publickly declared, that it &s;hould never be &s;aid had detained any one per|&s;on in his &s;ervice again&s;t his will; and he therefore ordered their wives and children, who had been left as ho&s;tages in his army, to be &s;ent after them. A conduct &s;o wi&s;e, and apparently generous, had a &s;urprizing effect in gaining the affections of the &s;oldiers, and made even tho&s;e his firm adherents who before were aver&s;e to his cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As Cyrus advanced by long marches, he received intelligence from all quarters, that the king did not intend to come to a battle with him directly, but had re&s;olved to wait in the interior parts of Per&s;ia till all his forces were a&s;&s;embled; and that, to &s;top his progre&s;s, he had ordered an intrench|ment to be thrown up on the plains of Babylon, with a ditch of five fathoms broad, and three deep, extending the length of twelve para&s;angs, or leagues, from the Euphrates to the wall of Media. Between the Euphrates and the ditch, a way had been left of twenty feet in breadth, by which Cyrus pa&s;&s;ed with his whole army, having reviewed it the day before. The king had neglected to di&s;pute this pa&s;s with him, and &s;uffered him to continue his march to|wards Babylon.</P>
<P>As Cyrus expected to engage every moment, he took care to proceed in order of battle, giving the command of the right wing of the Greeks to Clearchus, and that of the left to Menon. At length he di&s;covered his brother's army, amounting to
<PB N="127" REF="137">
twelve hundred thou&s;and men, be&s;ides a &s;elect body of &s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;e, approaching and preparing to attack him.</P>
<P>The place where the battle was fought was called Cunaxa, about twenty-five leagues from Babylon. Cyrus getting on hor&s;eback, with his javelin in his hand, commanded his troops to &s;tand to their arms, and proceed in order of battle. The enemy, in the mean time, who were headed by Artaxerxes in per&s;on, advanced &s;lowly and in good order. This &s;ight extremely &s;urprized the Greeks, who expected to have found nothing but tumult and confu&s;ion in &s;o great a multitude, and to have &s;een them ru&s;hing on with &s;trange and hideous outcries.</P>
<P>The armies were not di&s;tant above four or five hundred paces, when the Greeks began to &s;ing the hymn of battle, and to march on &s;oftly at fir&s;t, and with &s;ilence. When they came near the ene|my, they &s;et up great cries, &s;triking their darts up|on their &s;hields to frighten the hor&s;e; and then moving altogether, they &s;prung forward upon the barbarians with all their force, who did not wait their charge, but took to their heels, and fled uni|ver&s;ally, except Ti&s;&s;aphernes, who &s;tood his ground with a &s;mall part of his troops.</P>
<P>Cyrus &s;aw with plea&s;ure the enemy routed by the Greeks, and was proclaimed king by tho&s;e around him; but he did not give him&s;elf up to vain joy, nor as yet reckoned him&s;elf &s;ure of the victory. He peceived that Artaxerxes was wheeling his right wing to attack him in flank, and marched directly again&s;t him with &s;ix hundred hor&s;e. Di&s;covering his brother, he cried out, with eyes &s;parkling with rage, I &s;ee him, and &s;purred again&s;t him, followed only by his principal officers; for his troops had quitted their ranks, to pur&s;ue the fugitives, which was a capital blunder. The battle then became, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a &s;ingle combat between Artaxerxes

and Cyrus; and the two brothers were &s;een tran|&s;ported with rage and fury, endeavouring, like Eteocles and Polynices, to plunge their &s;words into each others hearts, to a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of the throne by the death of their rival.</P>
<P>Cyrus having forced his way through tho&s;e who were drawn up before his brother, joined him, and killed his hor&s;e, that fell with him to the ground: he ro&s;e, and was remounted upon another, when Cyrus attacked him again, gave him a &s;econd wound, and was preparing to give him a third, in hopes that it would prove his la&s;t. The king, like a lion wounded by the hunt&s;man, was only more furious from the &s;mart, and &s;prung forward, impe|tuou&s;ly pu&s;hing his hor&s;e again&s;t Cyrus, who running headlong, and without regard to his per&s;on, threw him&s;elf into the mid&s;t of a flight of darts aimed at him from all &s;ides, and received a wound from the king's javelin, at the &s;ame time that all the re&s;t di&s;|charged upon him. Cyrus fell dead; &s;ome &s;ay by the wound given him by the king; others affirm, that he was killed by a Carian &s;oldier, to whom, as a reward, Artaxerxes granted the privilege of bear|ing a golden cock on the point of his &s;pear at the head of the army. The principal officers of his court, re&s;olving not to &s;urvive &s;o good a ma&s;ter, were all killed around him: a certain proof, &s;ays Xe|nophon, that he well knew how to chu&s;e his friends, and that he was truly beloved by them. Ariaeus, who ought to have been the firme&s;t of all his ad|herents, fled with his right wing, as &s;oon as he heard of his death.</P>
<P>Artaxerxes, after having cau&s;ed the head and right hand of his brother to be cut off, pur&s;ued the enemy into their camp. Ariaeus had not &s;topped there, but having pa&s;&s;ed through it, continued his retreat to the place where the army had encamped
<PB N="129" REF="139">
the day before, which was about four leagues di&s;|tant.</P>
<P>Ti&s;&s;aphernes, after the defeat of the greate&s;t part of his left wing by the Greeks, led on the re&s;t again&s;t them, and by the &s;ide of the river, pa&s;&s;ed through the light-armed infantry of the Greeks, who opened to give him a pa&s;&s;age, and made their di&s;charges upon him as he pa&s;&s;ed, without lo&s;ing a man. They were commanded by Epi&s;thenes of Amphipolis, who was e&s;teemed an able captain. Ti&s;&s;aphernes kept on without returning to the charge, becau&s;e he perceived he was too weak, and went forward to Cyrus's camp, where he found the king who was plundering it, but had not been able to force the quarter defended by the Greeks, who &s;aved their baggage.</P>
<P>The Greeks on their &s;ide, and Artaxerxes on his, who did not know what had pa&s;&s;ed el&s;ewhere, be|lieved each of them that they had gained the vic|tory: the fir&s;t, becau&s;e they had put the enemy to flight, and pur&s;ued them; and the king, becau&s;e he had killed his brother, beat the troops he had fought, and plundered their camp. The matter was &s;oon cleared up on both &s;ides. Ti&s;&s;aphernes, upon his arrival at the camp, informed the king, that the Greeks had defeated his left wing, and pur&s;ued it to a great di&s;tance; and the Greeks, on their &s;ide, learnt, that the king, in pur&s;uing Cy|rus's left, had penetrated into the camp. Upon this advice the king rallied his troops, and marched in que&s;t of the enemy; and Clearchus, being re|turned from pur&s;uing the Per&s;ians, advanced to op|po&s;e him.</P>
<P>The two armies were very &s;oon near each other, when, after &s;everal movements on both &s;ides in order to gain the advantage of the ground, they at la&s;t came to a battle, and the Greeks routed the barbarians with the &s;ame facility as before. They
<PB N="130" REF="140">
even pur&s;ued them to a hill at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance where the enemy ventured to halt, and were preparing to attack them a &s;econd time, when the Per&s;ians dreading another overthrow, betook them|&s;elves again to flight in the utmo&s;t di&s;order.</P>
<P>As it was almo&s;t night, the Greeks laid down their arms to re&s;t them&s;elves, much &s;urprized that neither Cyrus, or any from him, appeared; and imagining, that he was either engaged in the pur|&s;uit of the enemy, or was making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of &s;ome important place (for they were &s;till igno|rant of his death, and the defeat of the left wing of the army) they determined to return to their camp, and found the greate&s;t part of the baggage taken, with all the provi&s;ions, and four hundred waggons laden with corn and wine, which Cyrus had expre&s;sly cau&s;ed to be carried along with the army for the Greeks, in ca&s;e of any pre&s;&s;ing ne|ce&s;&s;ity. They pa&s;&s;ed the night in the camp, the greate&s;t part of them without any refre&s;hment, con|cluding that Cyrus was alive and victorious. But when they heard of his death, they &s;ent to Ariaeus, as conqueror and commander in chief, to offer him the Per&s;ian crown. Meanwhile the king al&s;o con|&s;idering him&s;elf as conqueror, &s;ent to them to &s;ur|render their arms, and implore his mercy; repre|&s;enting to them, at the &s;ame time, that as they were in the heart of his dominions, &s;urrounded with va&s;t rivers and numberle&s;s nations, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape his vengeance, and therefore they had no other choice left but to &s;ub|mit to the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Upon debating among them&s;elves what an&s;wer they &s;hould return, Proxenus de&s;ired to know of the heralds, upon what terms the king demanded their arms: if as a conqueror, it was in his power to take them; if upon any other footing, what would he give them in return. He was &s;econded by Xe|nophon, who &s;aid, that they had nothing left but
<PB N="131" REF="141">
their arms and their liberty, and that they could not pre&s;erve the one without the other. Clearchus ob&s;erved to the &s;ame effect, that if the king was di&s;po&s;ed to be their friend, they &s;hould be better able to &s;erve him with their arms than without; if their enemy, they &s;hould have need of them for their defence. Some, indeed, &s;poke a milder language; that as they had &s;erved Cyrus faithfully, they would al&s;o &s;erve Artaxerxes, if he would employ them; and provided he would, at the &s;ame time, put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Egypt. At la&s;t it was agreed, that they &s;hould remain in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, without either advancing or retreating; and that if they did either, it &s;hould be looked upon as a de|claration of war: &s;o that the treaty &s;eems to have been managed in &s;uch a manner as to avoid giving a direct an&s;wer, and merely to amu&s;e the king and gain time.</P>
<P>While this affair was in agitation, they received Ariaeus's an&s;wer, that there were too many great men in Per&s;ia to let him quietly po&s;&s;e&s;s the throne, for which rea&s;on he intended to &s;et out early the next morning on his return to Greece; and that, it they had a mind to accompany him, they mu&s;t join him that night in his camp; which they ac|cordingly all did, except Milthocytus, a Thracian, who went over with a party of three hundred men and forty hor&s;e to the king. The re&s;t, in conjunc|tion with Ariaeus's forces, decamped by break of day, and continued their march until &s;un-&s;et, when they di&s;covered from the neighbouring villages, that the king was in pur&s;uit of them.</P>
<P>Clearchus who had the command of the Greeks, or|dered his men to halt, and prepared for an engagement. The king of Per&s;ia, intimidated by &s;o re&s;olute a conduct, &s;ent heralds, not to demand their &s;urren|der, but to propo&s;e terms of accommodation. When Clearchus was informed of their arrival, he
<PB N="132" REF="142">
ordered his attendants to bid them wait, and to tell them that he was not yet at lei&s;ure to hear them. He purpo&s;ely put on an air of haughtine&s;s and grandeur, to denote his intrepedity, and, at the &s;ame time, to &s;hew the fine appearance and good condition of his troops. When he advanced with the mo&s;t &s;hewy of his officers, expre&s;sly cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e, and had heard what the heralds had to &s;ay, he made an&s;wer, that they mu&s;t begin with giving battle, becau&s;e his men being in want of provi&s;ions, they had no time to lo&s;e. The heralds having carried back this me&s;&s;age to their ma&s;ter, re|turned immediately; which &s;hewed that the king, or whoever &s;poke in his name, was not far off. They &s;aid they had orders to conduct them to vil|lages where they would find plenty of provi&s;ions, and conducted them thither accordingly.</P>
<P>After three days &s;tay, Ti&s;&s;aphernes arrived, and in&s;inuated to them the good offices he had done them with his ma&s;ter. Clearchus vindicated him|&s;elf and his men by alledging, that they were en|gaged in this expedition without knowing the enemy again&s;t whom they were to fight; that they were free from all engagements, and would commit no act of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Per&s;ian king, if he would allow them to return quietly. Ti&s;&s;aphernes a&s;&s;ured them, that they &s;hould meet with no ob&s;truction: on the contrary, that they &s;hould be &s;upplied with all kinds of provi&s;ions in their march; and, the more effectually to en&s;ure their &s;afety, that he him&s;elf would accompany them on the way. But this &s;atrap's duplicity was equal to his cruelty. For the barbarian army always encamping at about a league's di&s;tance from the Grecians, left &s;ome room for &s;u&s;picion; and when they were arrived on the banks of the river Zabatus, Ti&s;&s;aphernes pretended that &s;ome of Clearchus's principal officers had en|deavoured to &s;ow jealou&s;ies between the two armies;
<PB N="133" REF="143">
and that if he would bring them to his tent the next day, he would point out the per&s;ons he had in his eye. Clearchus was &s;o weak as to agree to this propo&s;al; and accordingly he, together with Menon, Proxenes, Agis, and Socrates, went to the Per&s;ian general's tent, where they had no &s;ooner arrived, than, on a &s;ignal given, they were in&s;tantly &s;eized, their attendants put to the &s;word, and them&s;elves, after being &s;ent bound to the king, were beheaded in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The con&s;ternation of the Greeks, upon being informed of this ma&s;&s;acre of their generals, may be more ea&s;ily conceived than de&s;cribed. They were now near two thou&s;and miles from home, &s;ur|rounded with great rivers, exten&s;ive fore&s;ts, and inimical nations, without any &s;upplies of provi|&s;ions. In this forlorn condition they were almo&s;t overwhelmed with de&s;pair, and could think of taking neither refre&s;hment nor repo&s;e; but they recovered &s;ome faint hopes, when they began to reflect upon the abilities of Xenophon, a young Athenian, who had accompanied Proxenes into A&s;ia, and had hitherto &s;erved as a volunteer in the army. This was that Xenophon, afterwards &s;o famous as an hi&s;torian; and his conduct &s;eemed equal to his elo|quence, in which he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the re&s;t of man|kind. This young &s;oldier went to &s;ome of the Greek officers in the middle of the night, and repre&s;ented to them that they had no time to lo&s;e; that it was of the la&s;t importance to prevent the bad de&s;igns of the enemy; that, however &s;mall their number, they would render them&s;elves formidable, if they be|haved with boldne&s;s and re&s;olution; that valour, and not multitudes, determines the event of bat|tles; and that it was nece&s;&s;ary, above all things, to nominate generals immediately, becau&s;e an army without commanders is like a body without a &s;oul. A council was immediately held, at which an hun|dred
<PB N="134" REF="144">
officers were pre&s;ent; and Xenophon being de&s;ired to &s;peak, explained at large the rea&s;ons he had at fir&s;t but &s;lightly touched upon; and, by his advice, commanders were appointed. They were Tima&s;ion for Clearchus, Xanthicles for Socrates, Cleanor for Agis, Phile&s;ius for Menon, and Xeno|phon for Proxenes.</P>
<P>Before break of day they a&s;&s;embled the army. The generals made &s;peeches to animate the men, and Xenophon among the re&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"Fellow &s;oldiers, &s;aid he, the lo&s;s of &s;o many brave men by vile trea|chery, and the being abandoned by our friends, is very deplorable; but we mu&s;t not &s;ink under our misfortunes; and, if we cannot conquer, let us re&s;olve rather to peri&s;h gloriou&s;ly, than fall into the hands of barbarians, who would inflict upon us the greate&s;t mi&s;eries: let us call to mind the glorious battles of Plataea, Thermopylae, Salamis, and many others, wherein our ance&s;tors, though with a &s;mall number, have fought and defeated the innu|merable armies of the Per&s;ians, and thereby ren|dered the name alone of Greeks for ever formid|able. It is to their invincible valour we owe the honour we po&s;&s;e&s;s, of acknowledging no ma&s;ters upon earth but the gods, nor any happine&s;s but what con&s;i&s;ts with liberty. Tho&s;e gods, the avengers of perjury, and witne&s;&s;es of the enemy's trea&s;on, will be favourable to us; and as they are offended by the violation of treaties, and take plea|&s;ure in humbling the proud, and exalting the humble, they will al&s;o follow us to battle, and combat for us. For the re&s;t fellow-&s;oldiers, we have no refuge but in victory, which mu&s;t be our hope, and will make us ample amends for whatever it co&s;ts us to attain it. And I &s;hould think, if it were your opinion, that, for the making a more ready and le&s;s difficult retreat, it would be proper to rid our&s;elves of all the u&s;ele&s;s baggage, and to keep only what is ab|&s;olutely
<PB N="135" REF="145">
nece&s;&s;ary in our march."</Q> All the &s;oldiers that moment lifted up their hands, to &s;ignify their approbation of what had been &s;aid, and without lo&s;s of time &s;et fire to their tents and baggage; &s;uch of them as had too much equipage, giving it to others who had too little, and de&s;troying the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The van was led by Cheri&s;ophus, the Spartan general, and Xenophon, with Tima&s;ion, brought up the rear. They directed their march towards the heads of the great rivers, in order to pa&s;s them where they where fordable. But they had not ad|vanced far, before they were overtaken by a party of the enemy's archers and &s;lingers, commanded by Mithridates, which galled their rear, and wounded &s;everal of them, who being heavy armed, and with|out cavalry, could make no re&s;i&s;tance. To pre|vent the like inconvenience, Xenophon furni&s;hed two hundred Rhodians with &s;lings, and mounted fifty more of his men upon baggage hor&s;es; &s;o that when Mithridates came up with them a &s;econd time, and with a much greater body, he was repul&s;ed with lo&s;s, and the Greeks made good their retreat to the city of Lari&s;&s;a on the banks of the Tigris. From thence they marched to another de&s;olate city, called Mep&s;ila; and about four leagues from that place, Ti&s;&s;aphernes came up to them with his whole army, but after &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes was obliged to retire. They afterwards met with &s;ome ob&s;truction in pa&s;&s;|ing an eminence which the enemy had &s;eized, but from this they &s;oon found means to di&s;lodge them, and de&s;cended into the plain on the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>Their difficulties, however, &s;eemed to multiply as they advanced; for they were now hemmed in on the one hand by the river Tigris, and on the other by almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able mountains, inhabited by the Carduci, a fierce and warlike people, who, as Xenophon &s;ays, had, in the&s;e dangerous pa&s;&s;es, en|tirely de&s;troyed an army of an hundred and twenty
<PB N="136" REF="146">
thou&s;and Per&s;ians. But as they had no boats to cro&s;s the river, and as the road through the moun|tains led into the rich plains of Armenia, they re|&s;olved to pur&s;ue their march that way. The Car|duci &s;oon took the alarm; but not being prepared to oppo&s;e the Greeks in a body, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of the tops of the rocks and mountains, and from thence annoyed them with darts and great &s;tones, which they threw down upon them as they pa&s;&s;ed through the defiles, where they were likewi&s;e attacked by &s;everal other parties: and though their lo&s;s was not con&s;iderable, yet, what with &s;torms and famine, be&s;ides &s;even days tedious march, and being continually forced to fight their way, they underwent here much greater hard&s;hips than any they had hitherto &s;uffered.</P>
<P>Not far from the foot of the mountain, they met with a fre&s;h ob&s;truction. The river Centrites, about two hundred feet in breadth, pre&s;ented it&s;elf before them. Twice did they attempt to cro&s;s it; at fir&s;t without &s;ucce&s;s, on account of the depth of the water; but the &s;econd time they were more fortunate, and at length got to the other &s;ide.</P>
<P>They now proceeded with le&s;s interruption, pa&s;&s;ed the Tigris near its &s;ource, and arrived at the little river Teleboa, which is the boundary of the We&s;tern Armenia. This province was governed by Tiri|ba&s;us, a great favourite of the king, and who had the honour to help him to mount on hor&s;eback when at Court. He offered to let the army pa&s;s, and to furni&s;h the men with the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions, pro|vided they ab&s;tained from all acts of ho&s;tility; and this propo&s;al was accepted and ratified on both &s;ides. Tiriba&s;us, however, kept a flying camp at a &s;mall di&s;tance from the army. There fell, at the &s;ame time, a great quantity of &s;now, which put the troops to &s;ome inconvenience; and they learnt from a pri&s;oner, that Tiriba&s;us intended to attack
<PB N="137" REF="147">
them in a defile of the mountains, through which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s. They took care, how|ever, to prevent him, by &s;eizing that po&s;t, after having routed the enemy. After &s;ome days march through the de&s;ert, they pa&s;&s;ed the Euphrates near its head, not having the water above their middle.</P>
<P>They were afterwards incommoded by a north wind, which blew in their faces, and prevented re|&s;piration, &s;o that it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;acri|fice to the wind; upon which, we are told, it began to abate. They proceeded through the &s;now five or &s;ix feet deep, which killed &s;everal &s;ervants and bea&s;ts of burden, be&s;ides thirty &s;oldiers. They made fires in the night, for they found plenty of wood. All the next day they continued their march through the &s;now, when many of them, from long fa&s;ting, followed with languor, or fainting, fell down upon the ground through weakne&s;s and want of &s;pirits; but when &s;omething had been given them to eat, they found them&s;elves relieved, and re&s;umed their march.</P>
<P>After a march of &s;even days they arrived at the river Araxes, otherwi&s;e called the Pha&s;us, which is about one hundred feet in breadth. Two days after, they di&s;covered the Pha&s;ians, the Chalybes, and the Taochians, who had &s;eized the pa&s;s of the mountains, to prevent their de&s;cending into the plain. Xenophon, however, ob&s;erved, that they defended only the ordinary pa&s;&s;age; and by his ad|vice, therefore, a party was &s;ent to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heights, which commanded that pa&s;&s;age; by which means the enemy were &s;oon di&s;lodged, and the road effectually cleared. Thus, after a march of twelve or fifteen days more, they arrived at a very high mountain, called Tecqua, from whence they de&s;cried the &s;ea. The fir&s;t who perceived it rai&s;ed great &s;houts of joy for a con&s;iderable time, which made Xenophon imagine the vanguard was
<PB N="138" REF="148">
attacked, and he therefore advanced to &s;upport it with the utmo&s;t expedition. As he approached nearer, the cry of the &s;ea! the &s;ea! was di&s;tinctly heard, and the alarm changed into joy and exulta|tion: and when they came to the top, nothing was heard but a confu&s;ed noi&s;e, of the whole army cry|ing out together, the &s;ea! the &s;ea! whil&s;t they could not refrain from tears, nor from embracing their generals and officers: and then, without waiting for orders, they heaped up a pile of &s;tones, and erected a trophy with broken bucklers and other arms.</P>
<P>From thence they advanced to the mountains of Colchis, one of which was higher than the re&s;t, and of that the people of the country had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. As the ground in this pa&s;s was extremely unequal, the Greeks marched in files, in&s;tead of line of bat|tle; and attacking the enemy with great &s;pirit, they &s;oon put them to flight, and de&s;cended into the plain on the other &s;ide of the mountains. Here a very &s;ingular accident befel them, which at fir&s;t threw them into &s;ome con&s;ternation: for finding a number of bee-hives in the place, and eating greedily of the honey, they were &s;uddenly &s;eized with violent vomitings and fluxes; &s;o that tho&s;e who were lea&s;t ill &s;eemed like drunken men, and the re&s;t either furiou&s;ly mad or dying. The earth was &s;trewed with their bodies as after a defeat; not one of them, however, died, and the di&s;temper cea&s;ed the next day about the &s;ame hour it began. The third or fourth day the &s;oldiers got up, but in that condition which people are u&s;ually in after taking a violent medicine.</P>
<P>Two days after, the army arrived near Trebi&s;ond, a Greek colony of Sinopians, &s;ituated upon the Euxine, or Black &s;ea, in the province of Colchis. Here they lay encamped for thirty days, and acquit|ted them&s;elves of the vows they had made to
<PB N="139" REF="149">
Jupiter, Hercules, and the other deities, to obtain a happy return into their own country. They al&s;o celebrated the games of hor&s;e and foot races, and wre&s;tling and boxing, or the pancratium, the whole attended with the greate&s;t joy and &s;olemnity. Here Xenophon formed a project of &s;ettling them in tho&s;e parts, and founding a Grecian colony, which was approved of by &s;ome; but his enemies repre|&s;enting it to the army as only a more honourable way of abandoning them, and to the inhabitants as a de&s;ign to &s;ubdue and en&s;lave the country, he was obliged to give over the enterprize. The noi&s;e of it, however, had this good effect, that the natives did what they could in a friendly manner to ha&s;ten their departure, advi&s;ing to go by &s;ea as the &s;afe&s;t way, and furni&s;hed them with a &s;ufficient number of tran&s;ports for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Accordingly, they &s;et &s;ail with a fair wind, and the next day got into the harbour of Sinope, where Cheri&s;ophus met them with &s;ome gallies; but in&s;tead of the money he had promi&s;ed to pay them, he only told them they &s;hould recieve their arrears as &s;oon as they got out of the Euxine &s;ea. This an|&s;wer gave them &s;o much di&s;gu&s;t, that they re&s;olved to put them&s;elves under one general; and they de|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">red Xenophon, in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing and affec|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onate terms, to accept of that command, which be mode&s;tly declined, and procured the appoint|ment to fall upon Cheri&s;ophus. But he did not enjoy it above &s;ix or &s;even days; for they were no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ner arrived at Heraclea, than they depo&s;ed him its refu&s;ing to exhort a &s;um of money from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tants of that city; and as this was a Greek colony, Xenophon likewi&s;e refu&s;ed to have any concern in the affair: &s;o that the army, being di&s;|appointed in their hopes of plunder, broke out into a mutiny, and divided into three bodies. In a little time, however, they were happily re-united,
<PB N="140" REF="150">
and encamped at the port of Calpe, where they &s;et|tled the command as before, &s;ub&s;tituting Neon in the room of Cheri&s;ophus, who died here, and making it death for any one hereafter to propo&s;e the divid|ing of the army. But being &s;traitened for provi|&s;ions, they were obliged to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves up and down the country, where Pharnabazus's hor&s;e, being joined by the inhabitants, cut five hundred of them in pieces: the re&s;t e&s;caping to a hill were re&s;cued and brought off by Xenophon, who led them fir&s;t to Chry&s;opolis of Chalcedon, and after|wards to Byzantium.</P>
<P>From thence he conducted them to Salmyde&s;&s;a, to enable Seuthes, prince of Thrace, to recover his father's dominions, of which his enemies had deprived him. This prince had made great pro|mi&s;es to Xenophon and his men, if they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in this important undertaking; but when they had done him the &s;ervice he wanted, he was &s;o far from keeping his word, that he did not even give them the pay agreed on. Xenophon re|proached him &s;everely with this breach of faith, which, however, he attributed to the ill advice of his mini&s;ter, Heraclides, who thought to make his court to his ma&s;ter, by &s;aving him a &s;um of money at the expence of every thing that ought to be dear to a prince.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Charminus and Polynices ar|rived as amba&s;&s;ador from Lacedaemon, with advice, that the republic had declared war again&s;t Ti&s;&s;a|phernes and Pharnabazus; that Thimbron had al|ready embarked with the troops; and that the Spar|tans would give a daric a month to every &s;oldier, two to each officer, and four to the colonels, who &s;hould engage in the &s;ervice. Xenophon accepted the offer, and having obtained from Seuthes, by the mediation of the amba&s;&s;adors, part of the pay due to him, he went by &s;ea to Lamp&s;acus with the
<PB N="141" REF="151">
army, which amounted &s;till, after all its lo&s;&s;es, to about &s;ix thou&s;and men. From thence he advanced to Pergamus, a city in the province of Troas. Having met, near Parthenia, a great nobleman re|turning into Per&s;ia, he took him, his wife and chil|dren, with all their equipage, and by that means was enabled to di&s;tribute among the &s;oldiers very hand&s;ome gratuities, and to make them ample amends for all the lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained. Thim|bron at length arrived, and having a&s;&s;umed the command of the troops, and united them with his own, he marched again&s;t Ti&s;&s;aphernes and Pharnabazus.</P>
<P>Such was the end of Cyrus's expedition. Xeno|phon, who him&s;elf has written a mo&s;t elegant hi&s;|tory of it, computes, from the fir&s;t &s;etting out of that prince's army from the city of Ephe&s;us, to their arrival at the place where the battle was fought, five hundred and thirty para&s;angs, or leagues, and four|&s;core and thirteen days march; and in their retreat from the field of battle to Corcyra, a city upon the coa&s;t of the Euxine, or Black &s;ea, &s;ix hundred and twenty para&s;angs, or leagues, and one hundred and twenty days march: and, adding both together, he &s;ays, the way going and coming was eleven hundred and fifty-five para&s;angs, or leagues, and two hundred and fifteen days march; and that the whole time the army took to perform that journey, including the days of re&s;t, was fifteen months.</P>
<P>We come now to an affair of a more private and dome&s;tic, but not of a le&s;s intere&s;ting nature; we mean the death of Socrates, one of the mo&s;t ami|able and exalted characters that ever appeared in the world, either in ancient or modern times. We have already &s;een this great man, who was the &s;on of a &s;tone-cutter at Athens, emerging from the ob&s;cu|rity of his birth, and giving examples of courage, moderation, and wi&s;dom; we have &s;een him &s;aying the life of Alcibiades in battle, refu&s;ing to concur in the edict which unju&s;tly doomed the &s;ix Athenian
<PB N="142" REF="152">
generals to death, with&s;tanding the proceedings o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the thirty tyrants, and in a word, expre&s;&s;ing his de|te&s;tation of every thing which he deemed incon|&s;i&s;tent with the principles of honour and ju&s;tice. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as he always was, of the mo&s;t unbounded philanthropy, he was ready to forgive tho&s;e vices in others, from which he him&s;elf was in a great mea|&s;ure free. He &s;eemed, &s;ays Libanius, the common father of the republic, &s;o attentive was he to the happine&s;s and welfare of every individual of the &s;tate. But knowing how difficult it is to reform the old, and to make people change tho&s;e prin|ciples, which from their earlie&s;t infancy they have been accu&s;tomed to hold &s;acred, he applied him&s;elf chiefly to the in&s;truction of youth, in order to &s;ow the &s;eeds of virtue in a &s;oil more likely to produce the fruits of it. He had, however, no open &s;chool like the re&s;t of the philo&s;ophers, nor &s;et times for his le&s;&s;ons; he had no benches prepared, nor ever mounted a profe&s;&s;or's chair; he was the philo&s;opher of all times and &s;ea&s;ons; he taught in all places, and upon all occa&s;ions; in walking, conver&s;ation, at meals, in the army, in the mid&s;t of the camp, and in the public a&s;&s;emblies of the people.</P>
<P>Such was the man whom a faction in the city had long devoted to de&s;truction; he had been, for many years before his death, the object of their &s;atire and ridicule. Ari&s;tophanes, the comic poet, was engaged to expo&s;e him upon the &s;tage. He com|po&s;ed a play, called the Clouds, in which he intro|duced the philo&s;opher in a ba&s;ket, uttering the mo&s;t ridiculous ab&s;urdities. Socrates, who was pre&s;ent at the exhibition of his own character, &s;eemed not to feel the lea&s;t emotion; and as &s;ome &s;trangers were pre&s;ent who de&s;ired to know the original for whom the play was intended, he ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and &s;hewed him&s;elf during the whole repre&s;enta|tion. This was the fir&s;t blow &s;truck at him, and it was not till twenty years after, that Melitus ap|peared
<PB N="143" REF="153">
in a more formal manner as his accu&s;er, and entered a regular proce&s;s again&s;t him. The two chief crimes of which he accu&s;ed him, were, that he did not admit the gods acknowledged by the republic, and introduced new divinities; and that he corrupted the youth of Athens: and he therefore concluded with inferring, that &s;entence of death ought to be pa&s;&s;ed upon him.</P>
<P>The &s;econd charge was evidently groundle&s;s. How far the fir&s;t was founded in truth, we cannot, at this di&s;tance of time, pretend to determine. It is not likely, indeed, that amid&s;t &s;o much zeal and &s;uper&s;tition as then prevailed in Athens, he would venture openly to oppo&s;e the received religion; but it is very probable, from the di&s;cour&s;es he frequently held with his friends, that in his heart he de&s;pi&s;ed and laughed at their mon&s;trous opinions and ridi|culous my&s;teries, as having no other foundation than the fables of the poets, and that he had at|tained to the notion of the one true God, the cre|ator and pre&s;erver of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the con&s;piracy broke out, the friends of Socrat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s prepared for his defence. Ly&s;ias, the mo&s;t able orator of his time, brought him an ela|borate di&s;cour&s;e of his own compo&s;ing, in which he vindicated the conduct of Socrates with great fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce of rea&s;oning, and inter&s;per&s;ed the whole with tender and pathetic &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kes, capable of moving the mo&s;t occurate hearts.

nothing would be wanting on his part, but which however, would not &s;uit me. He per&s;i&s;ted, there|fore, inflexibly in the re&s;olution not to demean him|&s;elf, by begging &s;uffrages in the low abject manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> common at that time. He employed neither arti|fice not the glitter of eloquence; he had recour&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to no entreaties; he brought neither his wife no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> children to incline the judges in his favour by their &s;ighs and tears. Neverthele&s;s, though he refu&s;ed to make u&s;e of any other voice but his own in his defence, or to appear before his judges in the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive po&s;ture of a &s;uppliant, he did not behave in that manner out of pride, or contempt of the tri|bunal: it was from a noble and intrepid a&s;&s;urance re&s;ulting from greatne&s;s of &s;oul, and a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own innocence; &s;o that his defence had no|thing weak or timorous in it: his di&s;cour&s;e was bold, manly, generous, without pa&s;&s;ion, without emotion, full of the noble &s;entiments of a philo|&s;opher, with no other ornament than that of truth, and brightened throughout with the character and language of innocence. Plato, who was pre&s;ent, tran&s;cribed it afterwards, and, without any addi|tion, formed from it the work which he calls the apology of Socrates, one of the mo&s;t ma&s;terly compo&s;itions of Antiquity. I &s;hall here make an extract from it.</P>
<P>Upon the day appointed, the proceedings began in the u&s;ual form; the parties appeared before the judges, and Melitus &s;poke: the wor&s;e his cau&s;e, and the le&s;s provided it was with proofs, the more occa&s;ion had he for art and addre&s;s to cover its weakne&s;s; he omitted nothing that might render the adver&s;e party odious; and in&s;tead of rea&s;ons, which he could not produce, he &s;ub&s;tituted the glitter of a pompous declamation. Socrates, in ob&s;erving that he could not tell what impre&s;&s;ion the di&s;cour&s;e of his accu&s;er had made upon the judges,
<PB N="145" REF="155">
owns, that, for his own part, he &s;carce knew how it had affected him&s;elf. Melitus had given &s;uch artful colouring and likelihood to his arguments, though there was not one word of truth in all he had advanced.</P>
<P>"I am accu&s;ed, &s;aid he, of corrupting the youth, and of in&s;tilling dangerous maxims into them, as well in regard to the wor&s;hip of the gods, as the rules of government. You know, Athenians, that I never made it my profe&s;&s;ion to teach, nor can envy, however violent again&s;t me, reproach me with ever having &s;old my in&s;tructions. I have an undeniable evidence for me in this re&s;pect, which is my poverty. Always equally ready to communi|cate my thoughts to the rich and poor, and to give them lei&s;ure to que&s;tion or an&s;wer me, I lend my|&s;elf to every one who is de&s;irous of becoming vir|tuous; and if, among&s;t tho&s;e who hear me, there are any that prove either good or bad, neither the virtues of the one, nor the vices of the other, to which I have not contributed, are to be a&s;cribed to me. My whole employment is to per&s;uade the young and old again&s;t too much love for the body, for riches, and all other precarious things, of what|ever nature they be, and again&s;t too little regard for the &s;oul, which ought to be the object of their affections. For I ince&s;&s;antly urge upon you, that virtue does not proceed from riches, but, on the contrary, riches from virtue; and that all the other goods of human life, as well public as private, have their &s;ource in the &s;ame principle.</P>
<P>"If to &s;peak in this manner be to corrupt youth, I confe&s;s, Athenians, that I am guilty, and de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed. If what I &s;ay be not true, it is mo&s;t ea&s;y to convict me of fal&s;hood. I &s;ee here a great number of my di&s;ciples; they have only to appear. But, perhaps, their regard for a ma&s;ter, who was in&s;tructed them, will prevent them from
<PB N="146" REF="156">
declaring again&s;t me: at lea&s;t their fathers, bro|thers, and uncles cannot, as good relations and good citizens, di&s;pen&s;e with their &s;tanding forth again&s;t me, and demanding vengeance upon the corrupter of their &s;ons, brothers, and nephews. But the&s;e are the per&s;ons who take upon them my defence, and intere&s;t them&s;elves in the &s;ucce&s;s of my cau&s;e.</P>
<P>"Pa&s;s on me, Athenians, what &s;entence you plea&s;e; but I can neither repent nor change my conduct; I mu&s;t not abandon or &s;u&s;pend a function which God him&s;elf has impo&s;ed on me. Now he has charged me with the care of in&s;tructing my fellow-citizens. If, after having faithfully kept all the po&s;ts wherein I was placed by our generals at Potidaea, Amphipolis, and Delium, the fear of death &s;hould at this time make me abandon that in which the divine providence has placed me, by command|ing me to pa&s;s my life in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, for the in&s;truction of my&s;elf and others; this would be a mo&s;t criminal de&s;ertion indeed, and make me highly worthy of being cited before this tribunal as an impious man, who does not believe the gods.</P>
<P>"Should you re&s;olve to acquit me; for the fu|ture, I &s;hould not he&s;itate to make an&s;wer, Athe|nians, I honour and love you; but I &s;hall chu&s;e ra|ther to obey God than you; and to my late&s;t breath &s;hall never renounce my philo&s;ophy, nor cea&s;e to exhort and reprove you according to my cu&s;tom, by &s;aying to each of you when you come in my way, <Q REND="inline">"My good friend, and citizen of the mo&s;t famous city in the world for wi&s;dom and valour, are you not a&s;hamed to have no other thought than that of ama&s;&s;ing wealth and acquiring glory, credit, and dignities, whil&s;t you neglect the trea&s;ures of pru|dence, truth, and wi&s;dom, and take no pains in rendering your &s;oul as good and perfect as it is ca|pable of being."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="157">"I am reproached with abject fear and meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, for being &s;o bu&s;y in imparting my advice to every one in private, and for having always avoided to be pre&s;ent in your a&s;&s;emblies, to give my coun|&s;els to my country. I think I have &s;ufficiently proved my courage and fortitude, both in the field, where I have borne arms with you, and in the &s;enate, where I oppo&s;ed the unju&s;t &s;entence you pro|nounced again&s;t the ten captains, who had not taken up and interred the bodies of tho&s;e who were kill|ed or drowned in the &s;ea-fight near the i&s;land of Arginu&s;ae; and when, upon more than one occa&s;ion, I oppo&s;ed the violent and cruel orders of the thirty tyrants.</P>
<P>"What is it then, that has prevented me from appearing in your a&s;&s;emblies? It is that daemon, that voice divine, which you have &s;o often heard me mention, and Melitus has taken &s;o much pains to ridicule. That &s;pirit has attached it&s;elf to me from my infancy: it is a voice which I never hear, but when it would prevent me from per&s;i&s;ting in &s;omething I have re&s;olved on; for it never exhorts me to undertake any thing: it is the &s;ame being that has always oppo&s;ed me when I would have in|termeddled in the affairs of the republic, and that with the greate&s;t rea&s;on; for I &s;hould have been among&s;t the dead long ago, had I been concerned in the mea&s;ures of the &s;tate, without effecting any thing to the advantage of my country.</P>
<P>"Do not take it ill, I be&s;eech you, if I &s;peak my thoughts without di&s;gui&s;e, and with truth and free|dom. Every man, who would generou&s;ly oppo&s;e a whole people, either among&s;t us or el&s;ewhere, and who inflexibly applies him&s;elf to prevent the vio|lation of the laws, and the commi&s;&s;ion of iniquity in a government, will never do &s;o long with impunity. It is ab&s;olutey nece&s;&s;ary for him, who would con|tend for ju&s;tice, if he has any thoughts of living,
<PB N="148" REF="158">
to remain in a private &s;tation, and never to have any concern in public affairs.</P>
<P>"For the re&s;t, Athenians, if, in the extreme danger I am now in, I do not imitate the behaviour of tho&s;e, who upon le&s;s emergencies have implored and &s;upplicated their judges with tears, and have brought forth their children, relations, and friends; it is not through pride and ob&s;tinacy, or any con|tempt for you, but &s;olely for your honour, and for that of the whole city. You &s;hould know, that there are among&s;t our citizens tho&s;e who do not re|gard death as an evil, and who give that name only to inju&s;tice and infamy. At my age, and with the reputation, true or fal&s;e, which I have, would it be con&s;i&s;tent for me, after all the le&s;&s;ons I have given upon the contempt of death, to be afraid of it my|&s;elf, and to belie, in my la&s;t action, all the prin|ciples and &s;entiments of my pa&s;t life?</P>
<P>"But without &s;peaking of my fame, which I &s;hould extremly injure by &s;uch a conduct, I do not think it allowable to entreat a judge, nor to be ab&s;olv|ed by &s;upplications. He ought to be per&s;uaded and convinced. The judge does not &s;it upon the bench to &s;hew favour by violating the laws, but to do ju&s;|tice, in conforming to them. He does not &s;wear to di&s;charge with impunity whom he plea&s;es, but to do ju&s;tice where it is due. We ought not, therefore, to accu&s;tom you to perjury, nor you to &s;uffer your&s;elves to be accu&s;tomed to it; for, in &s;o doing, both the one and the other of us equally injure ju&s;tice and religion, and both are criminals.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Do not, therefore, expect from me, Athe|nians, that I &s;hould have recour&s;e among&s;t you to means which I believe to be neither hone&s;t nor lawful, e&s;pecially upon this occa&s;ion, wherein I am ac|cu&s;ed of impiety by Melitus; for if I &s;hould in|fluence you by my prayers, and thereby induce you to violate your oaths, it would be undeniably evi|dent,
<PB N="149" REF="159">
that I teach you not to believe in the gods; and, even in defending and ju&s;tifying my&s;elf, &s;hould furni&s;h my adver&s;aries with arms again&s;t me, and prove that I believe no divinity. But I am very far from &s;uch bad thoughts: I am more con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inced of the exi&s;tence of God than my accu&s;ers; and &s;o convinced, that I abandon my&s;elf to God and yet&punc; that you may judge of me as you may deem be&s;t for your&s;elves."</Q></P>
<P>Socrates pronounced this di&s;cour&s;e with a firm and intrepid tone: his air, his action, his vi&s;age, expre&s;&s;ed nothing of the accu&s;ed; he &s;eemed the ma&s;ter of his judges, from the a&s;&s;urance and great|ne&s;s of &s;oul with which he &s;poke, without however lo&s;ing any thing of the mode&s;ty natural to him. But how &s;light &s;oever the proofs were again&s;t him, the faction was powerful enough to find him guilty. By his fir&s;t &s;entence, however, he was only con|victed of the crimes laid to his charge: but when, by his an&s;wer, he &s;eemed to appeal from their tribunal to that of ju&s;tice and po&s;terity; when, in&s;tead of confe&s;&s;ing him&s;elf guilty, he demanded rewards and honours from the &s;tate, the judges were &s;o highly offended, that they condemned him to drink the juice of hemlock, the u&s;ual method of execution at that time in Athens.</P>
<P>Socrates received this &s;entence with the utmo&s;t compo&s;ure. Apollodorus, one of his di&s;ciples, breaking out into invectives and lamentations that his ma&s;ter &s;hould die <HI>innocent:</HI> <Q REND="inline">"What, replied Socrates, with a &s;mile, would you have me die <HI>guilty?</HI> Melitus and Anytus may kill, but they cannot hurt me."</Q></P>
<P>After his &s;entence, he &s;till continued with the &s;ame &s;erene and intrepid a&s;pect, with which he had long enforced virtue, and kept tyrants in awe. When he entered the pri&s;on, which now became the re&s;idence of probity and virtue, his friends fol|lowed him thither, and continued to vi&s;it him
<PB N="150" REF="160">
during the interval between his condemnation and death, which la&s;ted for thirty days. This long de|lay was owing to the following circum&s;tance: the Athenians &s;ent every year a &s;hip to the i&s;le of Delos, to offer certain &s;acrifices; and it was not permitted to put any per&s;on to death in the city, from the time that the prie&s;t of Apollo had crowned the poop of this ve&s;&s;el as a &s;ignal of her departure, till &s;he re|turned home: &s;o that &s;entence having been pa&s;&s;ed upon Socrates the day after this ceremony was performed, it became nece&s;&s;ary to defer the execution of it till the &s;hip &s;hould arrive at Athens.</P>
<P>In this long interval, death had &s;ufficient oppor|tunities to pre&s;ent it&s;elf before his eyes in all its terrors, and to put his fortitude to proof, not only by the &s;evere rigour of a dungeon, and the irons upon his legs, but by the continual pro&s;pect and cruel expectation of an event at which nature al|ways recoils. In this &s;ad condition he did not cea&s;e to enjoy that profound tranquillity of mind, which his friends had always admired in him. He entertained them with the &s;ame cheerfulne&s;s he had always pre|&s;erved; and Crito &s;ays, that the evening before his death, he &s;lept as quietly as at any other time. He compo&s;ed al&s;o an hymn in honour of Apollo and Diana, and turned one of Ae&s;op's fables into ver&s;e.</P>
<P>So little, indeed, was he apprehen&s;ive of death, that he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to e&s;cape from pri&s;on, when it was in his power. For the day before, or the &s;ame day that the &s;hip arrived, Crito, his intimate friend, came to him, and told him, that it now depended upon him&s;elf to quit the pri&s;on; that the jailer was gained; that he would find the doors open; and that he might, if he plea&s;ed, enjoy a &s;afe retreat in The&s;&s;aly. Socrates laughed at this propo&s;al, and a&s;ked him, whether he knew any place out of Attica where people did not die? Crito urged every argument he could think of to
<PB N="151" REF="161">
induce him to accept of his proffered deliverance. Socrates heard him with great attention, com|mended his zeal, and thanked him for his kindne&s;s. But, before he would give into his opinion, he was for examining whether it was ju&s;t for him to de|part out of pri&s;on without the con&s;ent of the Athe|nians. The que&s;tion therefore here was, whether a man condemned to die, though unju&s;tly, could, without a crime, elude the execution of the &s;en|tence that had been pa&s;&s;ed upon him. Socrates held that he could not; and, therefore, nobly re|fu&s;ed to e&s;cape out of pri&s;on. He reverenced the laws of his country, and re&s;olved to obey them in all things, even in death it&s;elf.</P>
<P>At length the fatal &s;hip returned to Athens, which was as it were the &s;ignal for the death of Socrates. The next day all his friends, except Plato, who was &s;ick, repaired to the pri&s;on early in the morn|ing. The jailer de&s;ired them to wait a little, be|cau&s;e the eleven magi&s;trates, who had the &s;uperin|tendence of the pri&s;ons, were at that time acquaint|ing the pri&s;oner, that he was to die the &s;ame day. Pre&s;ently after they entered, and found Socrates, who&s;e chains had been taken off, &s;itting by Xantippe his wife, who held one of his children in her arms. As &s;oon as &s;he perceived them, &s;etting up great cries, &s;obbing, and tearing her face and hair, &s;he made the pri&s;on re&s;ound with her lamentations, ex|claiming, <Q REND="inline">"Oh, my dear Socrates! your friends are come to &s;ee you this day for the la&s;t time!"</Q> He de&s;ired &s;he might be taken way, and &s;he was immediately carried home.</P>
<P>Socrates pa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the day in conver&s;ing with his friends, with great cheerfulne&s;s, upon one of mo&s;t important topics that can engage the atten|tion of the human mind, and one at the &s;ame time the be&s;t adapted to the occa&s;ion: it was upon the immortality of the &s;oul. What gave ri&s;e to this
<PB N="152" REF="162">
conver&s;ation was a que&s;tion introduced in a manner by chance, whether a true philo&s;opher ought not to de&s;ire, and take pains to die? This propo&s;ition, taken too literally, implies an opinion, that a phi|lo&s;opher may kill him&s;elf. Socrates &s;hews, that nothing can be more unju&s;t than this notion; and that man appertaining to God, who formed and placed him with his own hand in the po&s;t he oc|cupies, cannot abandon it without his permi&s;&s;ion, nor depart from life without his order. What is it then that can induce a philo&s;opher to be de&s;irous to die? It can be only the hope of that happine&s;s which he expects in ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her life; and that hope can be founded only upon the belief of the &s;oul's im|mortality.</P>
<P>Socrates employed the la&s;t day of his life in en|tertaining his friends upon this great and important &s;ubject; from which conver&s;ation Plato's admirable dialogue, intitled the Thaedon, is wholly taken. He explains to his friends all the arguments for believing the &s;oul immortal, and refutes all the ob|jections again&s;t it, which are very nearly the &s;ame that are made at this day.</P>
<P>When Socrates had done &s;peaking, Crito begged he would give him, and the re&s;t of his friends, his la&s;t in&s;tructions with regard to his children and other affairs, that, by executing them, they might have the con&s;olation of &s;hewing their re&s;pect for his memory. <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall recommend nothing to you this day, replied Socrates, more than I have al|ready done, which is, to take care of your&s;elves; you cannot give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e and my family a greater &s;atis|faction."</Q> Crito having a&s;ked him afterwards in what manner he would wi&s;h to be buried: <Q REND="inline">"As you plea&s;e, &s;aid Socrates, if you can lay hold of me, and I e&s;cape not out of your hands."</Q> At the &s;ame time, looking on his friends with a &s;mile, <Q REND="inline">"I can never, added he, per&s;uade Crito, that So|crates
<PB N="153" REF="163">
is he who conver&s;es with you, and arranges the &s;everal parts of his di&s;cour&s;e; for he always imagines, that I am what he is going to &s;ee dead in a little time: he confounds me with my carca&s;e, and therefore a&s;ks me how I would be interred."</Q> On fini&s;hing the&s;e words, he ro&s;e up, and went to bathe him&s;elf in a chamber adjoining. After he came out of the bath, his children were brought to him; for he had three, two very little, and the other grown up. He &s;poke to them for &s;ome time, gave his orders to the women who took care of them, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them. Being returned into his chamber, he laid him&s;elf down upon his bed.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant of the eleven entered at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and having informed him that the time for drinking the juice of hemlock was come (which was at &s;un-&s;et) the &s;ervant was &s;o deeply afflicted, that he turned his back, and fell a weeping. <Q REND="inline">"See, &s;aid Socrates, the good heart of this man; &s;ince my impri&s;onment he has often come to &s;ee me, and to conver&s;e with me; he is more worthy than all his fellows: how heartily the poor man weeps for me!"</Q> The fatal cup was now brought. So|crates a&s;ked what it was nece&s;&s;ary for him to do? <Q REND="inline">"Nothing more, replied the &s;ervant, than, as &s;oon as you have drunk off the whole draught, to walk about till you find your legs grow weary, and afterwards lie down upon your bed."</Q> He took the cup without any emotion, or change in his colour or countenance; and regarding the man with a &s;teady and a&s;&s;ured look: <Q REND="inline">"Well, &s;aid he, what &s;ay you of this drink; may one make a libation of it?"</Q> Upon being told there was only enough for one do&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"At lea&s;t, continued he, we may &s;ay our prayers to the gods, as it is our duty, and implore them to make our exit from this world, and our la&s;t &s;tage happy, which is what I mo&s;t ardently beg of them."</Q> After having &s;poke the&s;e words, he
<PB N="154" REF="164">
kept &s;ilence for &s;ome time, and then drank off the whole draught, with an amazing tranquillity, and &s;erenity of a&s;pect not to be expre&s;&s;ed, or hardly even conceived.</P>
<P>Till then his friends had been able, though with great difficulty, to refrain from tears; but after he had drunk the potion, they were no longer ma&s;ters of them&s;elves, but wept abundantly. Apol|lodorus in particular, who had been in tears almo&s;t during the whole day, began then to make &s;uch loud and bitter lamentations, as pierced the hearts of all that were pre&s;ent. Socrates alone remained un|moved, and even reproved his friends, though with his u&s;ual mildne&s;s and good-nature. <Q REND="inline">"What are you doing? &s;aid he to them; I wonder at you! Oh! what is become of your virtue? Was it not for this I &s;ent away the women, that they might not fall into the&s;e weakne&s;&s;es; for I have always heard you &s;ay that we ought to die peaceably, and ble&s;&s;ing the gods. Be at ea&s;e, I beg you, and &s;hew more con|&s;tancy and re&s;olution."</Q> He then obliged them to re&s;train their tears.</P>
<P>In the mean time he kept walking to and fro; and when he found his legs grow weary, he lay down upon his back, as he had been directed. The poi&s;on then operated more and more. When Socrates found it begin to gain upon the heart, un|covering his face, which had been covered, no doubt, to prevent any thing from di&s;turbing him in his la&s;t moments, <Q REND="inline">"Crito, &s;aid he, we owe a cock to Ae&s;culapius; di&s;charge that vow for me, and pray do not forget it."</Q> Soon after which he breathed his la&s;t. Crito went to his body, and clo&s;ed his mouth and eyes. Such was the end of Socrates in the fir&s;t year of the ninety-fifth olympiad, and the &s;eventieth of his age.</P>
<P>It was not till &s;ome time after the death of this great man, that the people of Athens perceived
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="4 pages">
<PB N="159" REF="165">
as favoured the Spartan cau&s;e, had taken refuge in the citadel; and till the&s;e were reduced, Thebes could not be &s;aid to be free. But a party of five thou&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and hor&s;e, arriving next morning from Athens, and &s;everal bodies of troops coming in at the &s;ame time from different parts of Boeotia, Pelopidas &s;oon found him&s;elf at the head of &s;o powerful an army, that he compelled the garri&s;on to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>The Spartans, though mortified, were by no means di&s;pirited with this rever&s;e of fortune. They &s;ent an army of near twenty thou&s;and men, under Age&s;ilaus, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h their power at Thebes. The name of the general alone &s;truck terror into the enemy, who were afraid to meet him in the open field, and they therefore took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a hill in the neighbourhood of the city. Age&s;ilaus &s;ent a party to provoke them to come down, and give him battle; and when he &s;aw they declined this, he drew out his whole army in order to attack them. But Chabrias, who commanded the Theban mercenaries, ordered his men to pre&s;ent them&s;elves, and keep their ranks clo&s;e together, with their &s;hields laid down at their feet, their &s;pears advanced, one leg forward, and the knee upon the half bend. Age&s;ilaus finding them prepared in this manner to receive him, and that they &s;tood as it were in defi|ance of him, thought fit to withdraw his army, and contented him&s;elf with ravaging the country. This was looked upon as an extraordinary &s;tra|tagem; and Chabrias valued him&s;elf &s;o much upon it, that he procured his &s;tatue to be erected in that po&s;ture.</P>
<P>The Spartans had hitherto been deemed unequalled in military prowe&s;s; but they now began to be rival|led, and even excelled, in that noble quality, by the Thebans. This particularly appeared in the battle of Tegyra. Pelopidas, the Theban general, had
<PB N="160" REF="166">
re&s;olved to attack Orchomenus, which was garri|&s;oned by the Spartans, and he therefore marched again&s;t it with a &s;mall party of three hundred foot, and forty hor&s;e; but hearing that a large body of Spartans were ha&s;tening to its relief, he thought it be&s;t to retire. In his retreat he fell in with this reinforcement near Tegyra, and finding it impo&s;|&s;ible to avoid a battle, he re&s;olutely prepared to en|gage. After a violent &s;truggle, which was main|tained with equal bravery on both &s;ides, Gorgoleon and Theopompus, the two Spartan generals, fell; and this &s;o intimidated their men, that they imme|diately retired on either hand, and opened a way for the Thebans to pa&s;s. But a &s;afe retreat could not &s;atisfy Pelopidas. Encouraged by his late &s;ucce&s;s, he drew up his men afre&s;h, and renewed the battle; and after committing a mo&s;t terrible havock among the enemy, he put them to an entire rout.</P>
<P>This was the mo&s;t &s;ignal di&s;grace the Spartans had ever met with. They had never before been known to yield even to an equal number; but here they were beat by a force not one third of their own. It mu&s;t be acknowledged, however, that the&s;e three hundred foot were the flower of the Theban army. They were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>&s;acred band.</HI> They were as remark|able for their fidelity to each other, as for their &s;trength and courage; they were linked together by the bonds of common friend&s;hip, and were &s;worn to &s;tand by each other to the very la&s;t ex|tremity. Thus united they became invincible, and generally turned the &s;cale of victory in their favour for a number of years; till at length they were cut down as one man, by the Macedonian phalanx under Philip.</P>
<P>Pelopidas was not the only, nor even the greate&s;t general that Thebes produced. Epaminondas, his contemporary and colleague in command, was every
<PB N="161" REF="167">
way his equal, and, if po&s;&s;ible, his &s;uperior. The&s;e two great men lived in the &s;tricte&s;t intimacy and friend&s;hip; and the only cau&s;e of rival&s;hip between them was, which of them &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h him|&s;elf mo&s;t in promoting the intere&s;t, or advancing the glory of their native country. Epaminondas had &s;pent the earlier part of his life in the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy, remote from the management of public affairs, either of a civil or military nature, in nei|ther of which he would ever engage, until he was overcome by the importunites of his countrymen, who thought they perceived in him, amid&s;t all his diffidence and &s;elf-denial, the &s;eeds of many great and excellent qualities. Nor were they deceived in their opinion; for when he was placed as it were by force, and again&s;t his will, at the head of an army, he &s;hewed the world, that an application to the polite arts, &s;o far from d &s;qualifying a man for a public &s;tation, only renders him capable of filling it with more di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e two excellent generals, therefore, Thebes was able not only to maintain its own in|dependence, but even to threaten the re&s;t of Greece with &s;ubjection: and it was probably the apprehen|&s;ion of this la&s;t event, that had made the Athe|nians break off their alliance with the Thebans, and join in a confederacy with the Spartans again&s;t their former allies. The Spartans had long con|&s;idered them&s;elves as the umpires and arbitrators of Greece, and could ill bear a rival in this boa&s;ted pre-eminence. They, therefore, re&s;olved to hum|ble the pride of Thebes, and with this view their general, Cleombrotus, marched towards the fron|tiers of Boeotia with a numerous army. But in order to give an air of ju&s;tice to their ho&s;tilities, they fir&s;t &s;ent to demand of the Thebans, that they &s;hould re&s;tore the cities they had &s;eized to their liberties; that they &s;hould rebuild tho&s;e they had
<PB N="162" REF="168">
demoli&s;hed, and make reparation for all the wrongs they had done. To this it was replied, <Q REND="inline">"That the Thebans were accountable to none but heaven for their conduct."</Q> Nothing now remained on either &s;ide, but to prepare for action. Epaminondas immediately rai&s;ed all the troops he could, and began his march; his army did not amount to &s;ix thou&s;and men, and the enemy had above four times that number. As &s;everal bad omens were urged to prevent his &s;etting out, he replied only by repeating a ver&s;e from Homer, importing, that there is but one good omen to fight for one's country. However, to rea&s;&s;ure the &s;oldiers, by nature &s;uper&s;titious, and whom he per|ceived to be di&s;couraged, he in&s;tructed &s;everal per|&s;ons to come from different places, and report au|guries and omens in his favour, which revived the &s;pirit and hopes of his troops.</P>
<P>Epaminondas had wi&s;ely taken care to &s;ecure a pa&s;s, which would have &s;hortened Cleombrotus's march con&s;iderably. The latter, after having taken a large compa&s;s, arrived at Leuctra, a &s;mall town of Boeotia, between Plataea and The&s;piae. Both parties con&s;ulted whether they &s;hould give battle; which Cleombrotus re&s;olved to do by the advice of his officers, who &s;aid, that if he declined fighting with &s;uch a &s;uperiority of troops, it would confirm the current report, that he &s;ecretly favoured the Thebans. And the&s;e la&s;t, on their &s;ide, had an e&s;&s;ential rea&s;on for ha&s;tening a battle before the arrival of the troops, which the enemy daily ex|pected. However, the &s;ix generals, who formed the council of war, being equally divided in their &s;entiments, the &s;eventh, who was Pelopidas, came in very good time to join the three that were for fighting: and his opinion carrying the que&s;tion, it was at la&s;t determined to engage.</P>
<P>The two armies, as we have already &s;aid, were very unequal in number. The Lacedaemonians
<PB N="163" REF="169">
amounted to twenty-four thou&s;and foot, and &s;ixteen hundred hor&s;e. The Thebans had only &s;ix thou&s;and foot and four hundred hor&s;e; but all of them choice troops, animated by the love of glory, and re&s;olved either to conquer or die. The Lacedaemonian cavalry, compo&s;ed of men picked up by chance, without valour, and ill di&s;ciplined, were as much inferior to their enemies in courage, as &s;uperior in number. The infantry could not be depended on, except the Lacedaemonians; the allies having en|gaged in the war with reluctance, becau&s;e they did not approve the motive of it, and being be&s;ides di&s;&s;atisfied with the Spartans. The ability of the generals alone &s;upplied the place of great armies, e&s;pecially that of the Theban commander, who was the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed &s;oldier of his time; and he was nobly &s;upported by Pelopidas, who was then at the head of the &s;acred band.</P>
<P>Upon the day of battle, the two armies drew up on a plain. Cleombrotus was upon the right, at the head of the Lacedaemonians, in whom he mo&s;t confided, and who&s;e files were twelve feet deep. The left wing, con&s;i&s;ting of the allies, was com|manded by Archidamus, the &s;on of Age&s;ilaus. Epaminondas took po&s;t in the left of his army, and was oppo&s;ed to Cleombrotus, whom he was determined to attack, convinced that if once he could break the Lacedaemonian phalanx, the re&s;t of the army would &s;oon be put to flight.</P>
<P>The action began with the cavalry, which were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ted on both &s;ides in the front of the left wing. As the Thebans were better mounted, and braver troops than the Lacedaemonian hor&s;e, the latter were &s;oon broke, and driven upon the infantry, which they put into &s;ome confu&s;ion. Epaminondas, following his hor&s;e clo&s;e, marched &s;wiftly up to Cleombrotus, and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of his heavy battalion. The latter, to make
<PB N="164" REF="170">
a diver&s;ion, detached a body of troops, with orders to take Epaminondas in flank, and to &s;urround him&punc; Pelopidas, upon &s;ight of that movement, advanced with incredible &s;peed and boldne&s;s, at the head of the &s;acred band, to prevent the enemy's de&s;ign, and flanked Cleombrotus him&s;elf; who, by that &s;udden and unexpected attack, was put into di&s;order&punc; The battle was very fierce and ob&s;tinate; and while Cleombrotus could act, the victory continued in &s;u&s;pence, and declared for neither party. But when he fell dead with his wounds, the Thebans to complete the victory, and the Lacedaemonians, to avoid the &s;hame of abandoning the body of their king, redoubled their efforts, and a great &s;laughter en&s;ued on both &s;ides. The Spartans fought with &s;o much fury about the body, that at length they gained their point, and carried it off. Animated by &s;o glorious an advantage, they propo&s;ed to return to the charge, which would perhaps have proved &s;uc|ce&s;sful, had the allies &s;econded their ardour: but the&s;e la&s;t, &s;eeing the Lacedaemonian phalanx broken, and believing all lo&s;t, e&s;pecially when they heard that the king was dead, took to flight, and drew the re&s;t of the army after them. The Thebans re|mained ma&s;ters of the field, erected a trophy, and permitted the enemy to bury their dead.</P>
<P>The Lacedaemonians had never received &s;uch a terrible blow. The mo&s;t bloody defeat, till then, had &s;carce ever co&s;t them more than four or five hundred of their citizens. Here they lo&s;t four thou&s;and men, of whom one thou&s;and were Lace|daemonians, and four hundred Spartans, out of &s;even hundred who were in the battle. The Thebans had only three hundred men killed, among whom were four of their citizens.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that when the news of this de|feat was brought to Sparta, the Ephori would not &s;uffer the public games, which were then celebrating,
<PB N="165" REF="171">
to be interrupted. Whether this proceeded from an affectation of indifference as if they wi&s;hed to repre&s;ent their lo&s;s as but trifling, and were de&s;irous of concealing the real greatne&s;s of it from the peo|ple; or that luxury and di&s;&s;ipation had then made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s even in Sparta it&s;elf; it is dif|ficult, at this di&s;tance of time, to determine. Next day, however, the lo&s;s of each particular family being known, the fathers and relations of tho&s;e who had fallen in battle, went to the temples to thank the gods, and congratulated each other upon their glory and good fortune, whil&s;t the rela|tions of tho&s;e, who had e&s;caped, were overwhelmed with grief and affliction.</P>
<P>But there was another point to be determined with regard to the&s;e la&s;t. They were, by the law, to be degraded from all honour, and rendered in|famous; in&s;omuch, that it was a di&s;grace to inter|marry with them: they were to appear publicly in mean and dirty habits, with patched and party-coloured garments, and to go half &s;haved; and whoever met them in the &s;treets, might in&s;ult and beat them, without their daring to make any re|&s;i&s;tance. This was &s;o &s;evere a law, and &s;uch num|bers had on this occa&s;ion incurred the penalties of it, many of whom were of great families and in|tere&s;t, that they apprehended the execution of it might excite &s;ome public commotion; be&s;ides that the&s;e citizens, &s;uch as they were, could very ill be &s;par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d at this time, when they wanted to recruit the army. Under this difficulty, they gave Age|&s;ilaus a power even over the laws, to di&s;pen&s;e with them, to abrogate them, or to enact &s;uch new ones as the pre&s;ent emergency required. He would not aboli&s;h or alter the law. He only made a public de|claration, that it &s;hould lie dormant for that &s;ingle day, but revive and be in full force again on the morrow; and, by that expedient, he &s;aved the ci|tizens from infamy.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="172">It was not long before the Spartans felt the con&s;equences of this dreadful overthrow. Num|bers of Greek cities, that had hitherto remained neuter, now declared in favour of the Thebans, and increa&s;ed their army to the amount of &s;eventy thou&s;and men. With this mighty force Epami|nondas entered Laconia, and over-ran the open country. He did not, however, attempt any thing again&s;t Sparta it&s;elf; but he re-in&s;tated the Ar|cadians in all their ancient rights and privileges, of which they had been deprived by the Spartans, and he enabled them to build a new city, which, from the name of the old one, was called Me&s;&s;enia.</P>
<P>So jealous were the ancient Greeks of every the lea&s;t encroachment on their liberty, that no action, however great or meritorious in other re&s;pects, was &s;ufficient to atone for it. This was &s;ignally ex|emplified in the ca&s;e of Pelopidas and Epaminondas, who, upon their return home, in&s;tead of being re|cieved as heroes and conquerors, were &s;ummoned as criminals before a court of ju&s;tice, to an&s;wer for their conduct in having retained their command four months beyond the time limited by law. This offence was capital by the laws of Thebes; and tho&s;e, who &s;tood up for the con&s;titution, were zeal|ous for having it adhered to on the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion. Pelopidas was the fir&s;t cited before the tri|bunal. He defended him&s;elf with le&s;s &s;trength and greatne&s;s of mind, than was expected from a man of his character, by nature warm and fiery. That valour, which was haughty and intrepid in fight, for&s;ook him before his judges. His air and di&s;|cour&s;e, which had &s;omething timid and low in it, denoted a man who was afraid of death, and did not in the lea&s;t incline the judges in his favour, who, neverthele&s;s, acquitted him, though not without difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="173">Epaminondas, on the contrary, appeared with all the confidence of con&s;cious innocence. In&s;tead of ju&s;tifying him&s;elf, he enumerated his actions: he related, in haughty terms, in what manner he had ravaged Laconia, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed Me&s;&s;enia, and de|livered the Arcadians. He concluded with &s;aying, that he &s;hould die with plea&s;ure, if the Thebans would relinqui&s;h the &s;ole glory of tho&s;e actions to him, and declare that he had done them by his own authority, and without their participation. All the voices were in his favour, and he returned from his trial as he u&s;ed to do from battle, with glory and univer&s;al applau&s;e. Such dignity has true valour, that it in a manner &s;eizes the admira|tion of mankind by force. This bold and manly deportment had &s;o good an effect, that his enemies declined any further pro&s;ecution; and he and his colleague were honourably acquitted. His enemies, however, jealous of his glory, were determined to mortify him, and with this view, procured him to be elected the city &s;cavenger; but he accepted the place with thanks, and declared, that, in&s;tead of thinking him&s;elf di&s;graced by the office, he would render it honourable by his manner of di&s;charging it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Spartans, &s;truck with con&s;ternation at their late defeat, applied to the Athenians for &s;uccour; and that people, notwith|&s;tanding their jealou&s;y of their old rivals, engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with all their forces. They likewi&s;e had recour&s;e to the Per&s;ian king for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but Pelopidas, undertaking an emba&s;&s;ay to the court of that prince, prevailed upon him to re|main neuter.</P>
<P>Soon after Pelopidas was &s;ent with an army again&s;t Alexander, king of Pherae, one of the mo&s;t blood-thir&s;ty tyrants that ever exi&s;ted, and who had, for &s;ome time, given great di&s;turbance to the
<PB N="168" REF="174">
whole country of The&s;&s;aly. This &s;avage had cau&s;ed &s;everal people to be buried alive, and others to be dre&s;&s;ed in bears and boars &s;kins, and then baited them with dogs, or &s;hot at them for diver|&s;ion. This mon&s;ter, however, Pelopidas compelled to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and even endeavoured, by mild u&s;age, to reform the natural brutality of his temper; but Alexander, in&s;tead of being grateful for the &s;alu|tary coun&s;els that were given him, re&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity of being revenged on his be|nefactor. Nor was it long before &s;uch an occa&s;ion offered; for Pelopidas being appointed amba&s;&s;ador to Alexander, was treacherou&s;ly &s;eized upon, and made pri&s;oner, contrary to all the laws of nations and humanity. It was in vain that the Thebans com|plained of this violation of laws; it was in vain they &s;ent a powerful army, but headed by indifferent generals, to revenge the in&s;ult: their army returned without effect, and Alexander treated his pri&s;oner with great &s;everity. It was re&s;erved for Epami|nondas to bring the tyrant to rea&s;on. Entering The&s;&s;alia at the head of a powerful army, his name &s;pread &s;uch terror, that the tyrant offered terms of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and delivered up Pelopidas from pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Pelopidas was &s;carce &s;et at liberty, when he re|&s;olved to puni&s;h the tyrant for his perfidy and breach of faith. He led a body of troops again&s;t him to a place called Cynocephalus, where a bloody battle en&s;ued, in which the Thebans were victorious, but Pelopidas was unfortunately &s;lain; and his countrymen con&s;idered tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es as very dearly earned, which were purcha&s;ed at the expence of his life. His death was equally lamented by the Thebans and The&s;&s;alians, who begged and obtained the honour of performing his funeral rites, which were very grand and magnificent. Alexander him|&s;elf was &s;oon after killed by his wife Thebe, and her three brothers, who, long &s;hocked at his cruel|ties,
<PB N="169" REF="175">
had re&s;olved to rid the world of &s;uch a mon&s;ter. It is &s;aid, that his whole palace was every night filled with guards, except his bed-chamber, which was an upper room, guarded by a dog, and a&s;cended by a ladder. Thebe allured away the dog, and covered the &s;teps of the ladder with wool, to pre|vent noi&s;e; and then her three brothers a&s;cending, one of them &s;eized him by the feet, and another by the hair, and the third &s;tabbed him to the heart.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the war between the Thebans and Spartans was carried on with unabated vigour. The Theban troops were commanded by their fa|vourite general Epaminondas; Age&s;ilaus, the only man in Greece, then capable of oppo&s;ing him, was at the head of the Spartans. The fir&s;t attempt of Epaminondas in this campaign &s;hewed his great abilities, and his &s;kill in the art of war. Hearing that Age&s;ilaus had begun his march for Mantinea, and had left but few citizens to defend Sparta at home, he marched directly thither by night, with a de&s;ign to take the city by &s;urprize, as it had neither walls nor troops to protect it. But luckily Age&s;i|laus had got &s;cent of his de&s;ign, and di&s;patched one of his hor&s;e to apprize the city of its danger; &s;oon after which he him&s;elf arrived with a powerful &s;uccour: and he had &s;carce entered the town, when the Thebans were &s;een cro&s;&s;ing the Eurotas, and ad|vancing again&s;t the city. Epaminondas, finding that his de&s;ign was di&s;covered, thought it below his character to retire without making &s;ome attempt. He therefore employed valour in&s;tead of &s;tratagem, and attacking the city at &s;everal quarters, penetrated as far as the public place, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that part of Sparta, which lay upon the hither &s;ide of the river. Age&s;ilaus exerted him&s;elf with greater activity than could have been expected from one of his years. He &s;aw well that it was not now a time, as before, to &s;pare him&s;elf, and to
<PB N="170" REF="176">
act only upon the defen&s;ive; but that he had need of all his courage and intrepidity to repel &s;uch an a&s;&s;ailant. His &s;on, Archidamus, at the head of the Spartan youth, behaved with incredible bravery wherever the danger was greate&s;t; and, with his &s;mall troop, &s;topped the enemy, and made head again&s;t them on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>A Spartan youth, named I&s;adas, filled not only his countrymen, but even the enemy with admiration of his valour. He had a beautiful face, an elegant &s;hape, an advantageous &s;tature, and was ju&s;t in the prime of youth; he had neither armour nor clothes upon his body, which &s;hone with oil. Upon the fir&s;t alarm he ran out of his hou&s;e with a &s;pear in one hand, and a &s;word in the other, and ru&s;hing into the thicke&s;t of the enemy, he bore down all before him, laying numbers dead at his feet, with|out him&s;elf receiving the lea&s;t wound. Whether the enemy were confounded at the &s;ight, as think|ing him &s;omething more than human, or whether, &s;ays Plutarch, the gods took plea&s;ure in pre&s;erving him on account of his extraordinary valour, re|mains a que&s;tion. His gallantry, however, was &s;o much admired, that the Ephori decreed him a gar|land; but they afterwards fined him a thou&s;and drach|mas, for having gone out to battle without armour.</P>
<P>Epaminondas having failed in his de&s;ign upon Sparta, was determined to &s;trike &s;ome other blow that might compen&s;ate for his mi&s;carriage. Hear|ing, therefore, that, in order to protect Sparta, al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the troops had been withdrawn from Mantinea, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;olved to march thither without delay.

<PB N="171" REF="177">
ru&s;hed out of the city, and attacked and defeated the Theban hor&s;e. In the mean time, Epaminondas was advancing with his whole army, with the enemy clo&s;e upon his rear. Finding it impo&s;&s;ible to accompli&s;h his purpo&s;e, before he was overtaken, he determined to halt and give them battle. He had now got within a &s;hort way of the town, which has had the honour of giving its name to the conflict of that day; a conflict the mo&s;t &s;plendid, and the be&s;t conte&s;ted, that is to be found in the hi&s;tory of Greece, or perhaps in that of any other country. The Greeks had never fought among them&s;elves with more numerous armies: the Lacedaemonians amounted to above twenty thou&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and hor&s;e; the Thebans to thirty thou&s;and foot, and three thou&s;and hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Epaminondas marched in the &s;ame order of battle in which he intended to fight, that he might not be obliged, when he came up with the enemy, to lo&s;e, in di&s;po&s;ing of his army, a precious time which cannot be recovered. He did not march directly, and with his front to the enemy, but in a column upon the hills, with his left wing foremo&s;t, as if he did not intend to fight that day. When he was over again&s;t them, at a quarter of a league's di&s;tance, he made the troops halt, and lay down their arms, as if he de&s;igned to encamp there. The enemy, in effect, were deceived by this &s;tep; and reckoning no longer upon a battle, they quitted their arms, di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves about the camp, and &s;uffered that ardour to cool, which the near approach of a battle is wont to kindle in the hearts of &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Epaminondas took advantage of this &s;upine con|duct of the enemy. By &s;uddenly wheeling his troops to the right, he changed his column into a line; and having drawn out his choice troops, he made them double their files upon the front of his
<PB N="172" REF="178">
left wing, in order to add to its &s;trength, and ena|ble it to attack in a point the Lacedaemonian pha|lanx, which, by the movement he had made, faced it directly. He ordered the center and right wing of his army to move very &s;low, and to halt before they came up with the enemy, that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon troops of which he had no great opinion.</P>
<P>He expected to decide the victory with that body of cho&s;en troops which he commanded in per&s;on, and which he had di&s;po&s;ed in a column to attack the enemy in the form of a wedge. He was per&s;uaded, that if he could penetrate the Lacedaemonian pha|lanx, in which the enemy's chief &s;trength lay, he &s;hould find it no difficult matter to rout the re&s;t of the army, by charging upon the right and left with his victorious troops.</P>
<P>To prevent the Athenians in the left wing from coming to the &s;upport of their right again&s;t his in|tended attack, he made a detachment of his hor&s;e and foot advance out of the line, and po&s;ted them upon a ri&s;ing ground, in readine&s;s to flank the Athe|nians, if they &s;hould venture to advance to &s;u&s;tain their right.</P>
<P>After having drawn up his army in this manner, he moved on to charge the enemy with the whole weight of his column. They were greatly &s;ur|prized when they &s;aw Epaminondas advancing to|wards them in this order, and immediately flew to their arms, bridled their hor&s;es, and made all the ha&s;te they could to their ranks.</P>
<P>While Epaminondas was marching again&s;t the enemy, the cavalry, that covered his flank on the left, the be&s;t at that time in Greece, con&s;i&s;ting en|tirely of Thebans and The&s;&s;alians, had orders to attack the enemy's hor&s;e. The conte&s;t here was violent, but not long. The Lacedaemonian hor&s;e were &s;oon repul&s;ed, and obliged to take refuge be|hind
<PB N="173" REF="179">
their infantry. In the mean time, Epami|nondas, with his body of foot, had charged the Lacedaemonian phalanx. The troops fought on both &s;ides with incredible ardour&punc; both the Thebans and Lacedaemonians being re&s;olved to peri&s;h, rather than yield the glory of arms to their rivals. They began fighting with their &s;pears; but the&s;e being &s;oon broken in the fury of the combat, they charged each other &s;word in hand. The re&s;i&s;tance was equally ob&s;tinate, and the &s;laughter very great on both &s;ides. De&s;pi&s;ing danger, and de&s;irous only of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves by the gallantry of their conduct, the men cho&s;e rather to die in their ranks, than lo&s;e a &s;tep of their ground.</P>
<P>This terrible &s;laughter having continued for &s;ome time, without the victory inclining to either &s;ide, Epaminondas, to turn the &s;cale in his own favour, determined to make an extraordinary effort in per|&s;on, without regard to the danger of his own life. He formed, therefore, a troop of the brave&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;olute about him; and putting him&s;elf at the head of them, made a vigorous charge upon the enemy, where the fight was hotte&s;t, and wounded the general of the Lacedaemonians with the fir&s;t javelin he threw. The troops, by his example, having wounded or killed all that &s;tood in their way, broke and penetrated the phalanx. The Lacedae|monians, di&s;mayed by the pre&s;ence of Epaminondas, and overpowered by the weight of that intrepid party, were obliged to give ground. The bulk of the Theban army, animated by their general's ex|ample and &s;ucce&s;s, drove back the enemy upon their right and left, and made great havoc among them. But &s;ome troops of the Spartans, perceiv|ing that Epaminondas was carried away by his ardour, &s;uddenly rallied, and returning to the charge, overwhelmed him with a &s;hower of javelins. While he kept off part of tho&s;e darts, &s;hunned &s;ome of
<PB N="174" REF="180">
them, fenced off others, and was fighting with the mo&s;t heroic valour, a Spartan, named Calli|crates, gave him a mortal wound with a javelin in his brea&s;t, acro&s;s his cuira&s;s. The wood of the javelin being broke off, and the iron head remain|ing in the wound, the torment was intolerable, and he fell immediately. The battle began around him with redoubled fury; the one &s;ide exerting their utmo&s;t efforts to take him alive, and the other to &s;ave him. The Thebans at la&s;t gained their point, and carried him off, after having put the enemy to flight.</P>
<P>After &s;everal different movements, and alternate lo&s;&s;es and advantages, the troops on both &s;ides &s;tood &s;till, and re&s;ted upon their arms; and the trumpets of the two armies, as if by mutual con&s;ent, &s;ounded the retreat at the &s;ame time. Each party pretended to the victory, and erected a trophy; the Thebans, becau&s;e they had defeated the right wing, and re|mained ma&s;ters of the field; the Athenians, becau&s;e they had cut the general's detachment in pieces: and from this point of honour, both &s;ides at fir&s;t refu&s;ed to a&s;k leave to bury their dead; which, with the ancients, was confe&s;&s;ing their defeat. The Lacedaemonians, however, &s;ent fir&s;t to demand that permi&s;&s;ion; after which, the re&s;t had no thoughts but of paying the la&s;t duties to the &s;lain.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Epaminondas had been car|ried into the camp. The &s;urgeons, after having examined the wound, declared, that he would ex|pire as &s;oon as the head of the dart was drawn out of it. The&s;e words filled all that were pre&s;ent with the deepe&s;t affliction, who were incon&s;olable on &s;eeing &s;o great a man upon the point of expiring. For him, the only concern he expre&s;&s;ed was about his arms, and the fate of the battle. When they &s;hewed him his &s;hield, and a&s;&s;ured him that the Thebans had gained the victory, turning towards
<PB N="175" REF="181">
his friends with a calm and &s;erene air, <Q REND="inline">"All then is well,"</Q> &s;aid he; and &s;oon after, upon drawing the head of the javelin out of his body, he expired in the arms of victory.</P>
<P>As the glory of Thebes ro&s;e with Epaminondas, &s;o it fell with him; and he is, perhaps, the only in&s;tance of one man's being able to in&s;pire his countrymen with a love of military fame, without having had a predece&s;&s;or, or leaving an imitator of his example.</P>
<P>The battle of Mantinea was followed by a peace, which was ratified by all the &s;tates of Greece, ex|cept Sparta; the conditions of it were, that every &s;tate &s;hould retain what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and hold it independent of any other power. Nothing remark|able happened for &s;ome time after this, except an expedition of Age&s;ilaus into Egypt, whither he went to a&s;&s;i&s;t Tachos, who had u&s;urped the throne of that kingdom. Upon his arrival in Egypt, every one was eager to &s;ee a man, who had ac|quired &s;o &s;plendid a reputation. Accordingly great multitudes of people flocked to the place where he was; but how much were they &s;urprized, when, in&s;tead of an elegant, portly figure, they found a little old man, lying on the gra&s;s, with his clothes thread-bare, and his hair uncombed! They were &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed, upon their offering him pre|&s;ents of perfumes, and other Egyptian luxuries: <Q REND="inline">"Give the&s;e things," &s;aid he, "to my helots; Spartan freemen know not how to u&s;e them."</Q> Being ill u&s;ed by Tachos, whom he found very un|grateful, he joined Nectanebus, his nephew, and rai&s;ed him to the throne: and when he, in his turn, was oppo&s;ed by another competitor, Age&s;ilaus found means to defeat all the attempts of this la&s;t, and left Nectanebus in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;upreme power. As a reward of his &s;ervices, he received a pre&s;ent of two hundred and thirty talents of &s;ilver; and was
<PB N="176" REF="182">
treated, be&s;ides, with every mark of gratitude and re&s;pect. In returning home he was driven into the haven of Menelaus, which lies upon the coa&s;t of Africa, where he was attacked with an acute di&s;|ea&s;e, and carried off, being then upwards of eighty years of age, forty of which he had been king.</P>
<P>The character of Age&s;ilaus was a compound of very different and even oppo&s;ite qualities. He was of a little &s;tature, and lame of a leg; and indeed, he was &s;o fully convinced of the meanne&s;s of his appearance, that he would never &s;uffer any &s;tatue of him to be erected during his life; and he &s;trictly prohibited the Spartans from erecting any after his death. He always paid the utmo&s;t deference to the &s;enate and the Ephori, by which means he had it in his power to execute all his de&s;igns without any oppo&s;ition. A rigid ob&s;erver of the old Spartan plainne&s;s and frugality, he was capable of enduring the greate&s;t labour and fatigue. The love of his chil|dren was a di&s;tingui&s;hed feature in his character. One day, when a friend found him riding with them on a hobby-hor&s;e, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;urprize, <Q REND="inline">"Don't," &s;aid he, "&s;ay one word of this, till you your&s;elf become a father."</Q> His genero&s;ity to his enemies was only exceeded by his partiality to his friends; of the latter of which he gave a remark|able proof in his reque&s;t to Idrieus, prince of Caria, in favour of Nicias: <Q REND="inline">"If Nicias, &s;aid he, be innocent, acquit him on his own account; if guilty, acquit him on mine; in any event, acquit him."</Q> He had a very &s;ingular way of deceiving his enemies. When about to enter upon a march, he took care to publi&s;h the true account of his in|tended route, and time of marching; by which he generally had the plea&s;ure of hearing, that they had moved on a different day, and taken a different road from that which they wi&s;hed to take. So high was his reputation both for courage and con|duct,
<PB N="177" REF="183">
that the Spartans appointed him not only their general, but likewi&s;e their admiral; a mark of honour never conferred upon any one before.</P>
<P> Of all the Greeks, the Athenians were the mo&s;t remarkable for their love of the polite arts, and particularly for their attachment to the &s;tage. This la&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, indeed, they now carried to &s;uch an extravagant length, that, according to Plutarch, it co&s;t more to repre&s;ent &s;ome of the famous pieces of Sophocles and Euripides, than it had done to carry on the war again&s;t the Barbarians. And, in order to &s;upport this charge, they &s;eized upon the fund which had been &s;et apart for the war, with a pro|hibition, upon pain of death, ever to advi&s;e the ap|plying of it to any other purpo&s;e. They not only rever&s;ed this decree, but went as far the other way, making it death to propo&s;e the re&s;toring this fund to the u&s;es for which it had been originally rai&s;ed. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the other &s;tates of Greece would pay much re&s;pect to a people that were thus immer&s;ed in luxury and di&s;&s;ipation; and accordingly many of tho&s;e, who had hitherto been in alliance with the Athenians, now commenced ho&s;tilities again&s;t them. <NOTE PLACE="marg">[A. J. C. 358.</NOTE>This war, however, which was &s;oon ter|minated, was not attended with any remarkable event, except that Chabrias, the Athenian general, at the &s;iege of Chio, preferred his honour to his life, and cho&s;e to peri&s;h in his ve&s;&s;el rather than abandon her. In the mean time, a power was growing up in Greece, hitherto unob&s;erved, but now too con&s;picuous and formidable to be over|looked in the general picture: this was that of the Macedonians, a people hitherto ob&s;cure, and in a manner barbarous; and who, though warlike and hardy, had never yet pre&s;umed to intermeddle in the affairs of Greece: but now &s;everal circum|&s;tances concurred to rai&s;e them from that ob&s;curity,
<PB N="178" REF="184">
and to involve them in mea&s;ures, which, by de|grees, wrought a thorough change in the &s;tate of Greece. It will be nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, to begin with a &s;hort account of their power and origin, before we enter into a detail of that con&s;picuous part, which they afterwards performed on the theatre of the world.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. FROM THE BIRTH TO THE DEATH OF PHILIP, KING OF MACEDON.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t king, who is mentioned, with any degree of certainty, to have reigned in Mace|donia, was Caranus, by birth an Argive, and &s;aid to be the &s;ixteenth in de&s;cent from Hercules. It was upon this foundation, that Philip afterwards grounded his preten&s;ions to be of the race of Hercules, and a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf divine honours. Caranus is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to have led forth a body of his countrymen, by the advice of the oracle, into tho&s;e parts where he &s;ettled, and to have made him&s;elf king. Caranus having, accord|ing to the general account, reigned twenty-eight years, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was continued after him to the times we are now treating of. But there is very little worth notice recorded of the&s;e kings, who were generally employed in defending them|&s;elves again&s;t the incur&s;ions of their neighbours. And as to their dome&s;tic affairs, they were re|markable only for the frequent murders and u&s;ur|pations which happened in the royal family.</P>
<P>Amyntas, the father of Philip, left two elder &s;ons, Alexander and Perdiccas, both of whom po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne in their turn. The &s;econd of the&s;e left a &s;on, named Amyntas, who, while yet an
<PB N="179" REF="185">
infant, &s;ucceeded his father; but the &s;tate of public affairs requiring a prince of mature years, Amyntas was &s;oon depo&s;ed, and his uncle Philip advanced in his room.</P>
<P>Philip began his reign in the twenty-fourth year of his age, and the fir&s;t year of the 105th olympiad. He had received a con&s;iderable part of his educa|tion at Thebes, whither he had been carried, in his youth, as a ho&s;tage; and he there acquired, under Epaminondas, that intimate acquaintance with the art of war, as it was then conducted, which he afterwards di&s;played &s;o &s;ignally during the whole cour&s;e of his reign. He had now, indeed, oc|ca&s;ion for all his activity and addre&s;s, for he was &s;urrounded with almo&s;t as many enemies as he had neighbours. The Illyrians, who had &s;eized a part of his dominions, were preparing to attack him with a great army; the Paeonians were making daily incur&s;ions into his territories: and he had, at the &s;ame time, the misfortune to have two pre|tenders to his crown; Pau&s;anias, the Lacedaemo|nian, who was &s;upported by the Thracians; and Argaeus, whom the Athenians had undertaken to a&s;&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, with &s;o many ene|mies on his hands at once, and that before he was well &s;ettled on the throne, his fir&s;t care was to make &s;ure of his own people, to gain their affections, and to rai&s;e their &s;pirits; for they were very much di&s;heartened, having lo&s;t above four thou&s;and men in a battle they had lately fought with the Illyrians. He &s;ucceeded in the&s;e points by his dexterity and addre&s;s, and &s;till more by the force of his elo|quence, of which he was a great ma&s;ter. His next &s;tep was to train and exerci&s;e them, and reform their di&s;cipline; and it was at this time, that he in|&s;tituted the famous Macedonian phalanx, which did &s;o much execution. It was an improvement upon
<PB N="180" REF="186">
the ancient method of fighting among the Grecians, who generally drew upon their foot &s;o clo&s;e, as to &s;tand the &s;hock of the enemy without being broken.</P>
<P>The complete phalanx was thought to contain above &s;ixteen thou&s;and men; though it was al&s;o taken in general for any company or party of &s;ol|diers, and frequently for the whole body of foot. But this of Philip's invention is de&s;cribed by Poly|bius to be an oblong &s;quare, con&s;i&s;ting of eight thou&s;and pike men, &s;ixteen deep, and five hundred in front; the men &s;tanding &s;o clo&s;e together, that the pikes of the fifth rank were extended three feet beyond the line of the front. The re&s;t, who&s;e di&s;|tance from the front made their pikes u&s;ele&s;s, re&s;ted upon the &s;houlders of tho&s;e who &s;tood before them, and &s;o looking them together in file, pre&s;&s;ed forward to &s;upport and pu&s;h on the former ranks, by which means the a&s;&s;ault was rendered more violent, and almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>Philip having &s;ettled his affairs at home, and compromi&s;ed all differences with &s;uch of his enemies as lay neare&s;t to him, turned his arms again&s;t the Athenians, who were marched up to Methone, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Argaeus. He gave them battle, and defeated them; and the death of Argaeus, who was killed in the action, put an end to that di&s;pute: for he permitted the Athenians, when they were in his power, to return home. This in&s;tance of his mo|deration gained &s;o far upon them, that they &s;oon after concluded a peace with him; which yet he ob&s;erved no longer, than was nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the other part of his dominions.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he marched northward, and &s;ub|dued fir&s;t the Paeonians, and afterwards the Illy|rians, the latter of whom he likewi&s;e compelled to re&s;tore all the conque&s;ts they had made in Mace|donia. He next made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Amphi|polis, which lay upon the river Strymon, and was
<PB N="181" REF="187">
the key of his dominions on that quarter. This place he had &s;eized in the beginning of his reign, but afterwards abandoned it in compliment to the Athenians, to whom it originally belonged; but now being le&s;s apprehen&s;ive of the di&s;plea&s;ure of that people, he made an entire conque&s;t of it, and added it to his dominions. The Athenians, how|ever, them&s;elves, he always treated with great re|&s;pect, whenever they fell into his hands, as he par|ticularly did upon his taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Pydna and Potidaea; for this la&s;t place being garri&s;oned by the Athenians, he &s;ent them home &s;afe with many marks of civility.</P>
<P>Proceeding &s;till in his encroachments upon his neighbours, he &s;eized the city of Crenides, which had been built only two years before, and he now called it Philippi, from his own name. It was here that he di&s;covered a gold mine, which every year produced an hundred and forty four-thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. This, which was an immen&s;e &s;um for that age, was much more &s;erviceable than fleets and armies in fighting his battles; and he &s;eldom failed to make u&s;e of it in every negocia|tion. It is &s;aid, that con&s;ulting the oracle of Del|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">os, concerning the &s;ucce&s;s or an intended expe|dition, he received for an&s;wer, <Q REND="inline">"That with &s;ilver &s;pears he &s;hould conquer all things."</Q> He took the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">int, and, by his &s;ucce&s;s, verified the prediction of the oracle: indeed, he was le&s;s proud of the &s;ucce&s;s of a battle, than of a negociation; well knowing, that his &s;oldiers and generals &s;hared in the former, whereas the honour of the latter was all his own.</P>
<P>But a larger field was now opening to his ambi|tion. The mutual divi&s;ions of the &s;tates of Greece were at no time wholly cemented, and they now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke out upon a very particular occa&s;ion. The fir&s;t cau&s;e of the rupture (which was afterwards called the &s;acred war) aro&s;e from the Phocians hav|ing
<PB N="182" REF="188">
ploughed up a piece of ground belonging to the temple of Apollo at Delphos. Again&s;t this all the neighbouring &s;tates exclaimed as a &s;acrilege: they were cited before the council of the Amphictyons, who had the care of &s;acred matters; and they were ca&s;t, and fined in a very heavy &s;um. This the Pho|cians were unable to pay; they refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the decree; they alledged, that the care and pa|tronage of the temple anciently belonged to them; and to prove this, they quoted a precedent from Homer.</P>
<P>Philomelus, one of their citizens, had the chief hand in exciting them to take up arms; he rai&s;ed their ardour, and was appointed their general. He fir&s;t applied him&s;elf to the Spartans, who had like|wi&s;e been fined by the Amphictyons, for having &s;eized the Cadmea after the battle of Leuctra. For this rea&s;on they were very well di&s;po&s;ed to join him, but did not yet think proper to declare them&s;elves openly: neverthele&s;s, they encouraged him &s;ecretly, and &s;upplied him with money; by which means he rai&s;ed troops, and, without much difficulty, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the temple. The principal oppo&s;ition he met with in the neighbourhood was from the Locrians; but having defeated them, he era&s;ed the decree of the Amphictyons, which was in&s;cribed on the pillars of the temple. Willing, however, to give a colour to his proceedings, he thought it convenient to con&s;ult the oracle, and to procure an an&s;wer in his favour. But when he applied to the prie&s;te&s;s for that purpo&s;e, &s;he refu&s;ed to officiate, until being intimidated by his threats, &s;he told him, the God left him at liberty to act as he plea&s;ed; which he looked upon as a good an&s;wer, and as &s;uch took care to publi&s;h it.</P>
<P>The Amphictyons meeting a &s;econd time, a re|&s;olution was taken to declare war again&s;t the Pho|cians. Mo&s;t of the &s;tates of Greece engaged in
<PB N="183" REF="189">
this quarrel, and e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of the one party or the other. The Thebans, the Locrians, the The&s;&s;alians, and &s;everal other neighbouring &s;tates, declared in favour of the God; whil&s;t Athens, Sparta, and &s;ome other cities of Peloponne&s;us, joined with the Phocians. This war, which la&s;ted for &s;ome time, was not remarkable for any thing el&s;e, except that which di&s;tingui&s;hes, or rather di&s;|graces all religious wars, I mean, the cruelties exer|ci&s;ed by both parties. The Thebans, having taken &s;ome pri&s;oners, condemned them all to die, as &s;acrilegious wretches; and the Phocians in their turn, by way of repri&s;al, inflicted the &s;ame puni&s;h|ment on their captives. Nay, Philomelus, their leader, being attacked on an eminence, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, threw him&s;elf headlong from a rock, rather than fall alive into the hands of his enemies. He was &s;ucceeded by Oenomar|chus.</P>
<P>Philip did not chu&s;e to interfere in this quarrel, which it was rather his intere&s;t to encourage than &s;uppre&s;s; being well plea&s;ed to &s;ee the different &s;tates of Greece weaken one another, and thus render them all an ea&s;ier prey to him when he &s;hould be at lei&s;ure to attack them.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t on the conclu&s;ion of this &s;acred war, that <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> was born. In his earlier years he had &s;everal ma&s;ters to teach him mu&s;ic, and other &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments: but when he grew up, his father wrote to Ari&s;totle, the mo&s;t celebrated philo&s;opher of his time, begging he would come, and undertake the education of his &s;on, and in&s;pire him with tho&s;e &s;entiments of mag|nanimity and ju&s;tice, which every great man ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which no other per&s;on was &s;o ca|pable of inculcating. He added, <Q REND="inline">"I return thanks to the gods, not &s;o much for having given me a
<PB N="184" REF="190">
&s;on, as for having given him to me, in the age in in which Ari&s;totle lives."</Q></P>
<P>Being de&s;irous of reducing Thrace under his dominion, he determined to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Methone, which ob&s;tructed his de&s;igns in that quar|ter. He accordingly be&s;ieged it, obliged it to &s;urrender, and levelled it with the ground. He lo&s;t one of his eyes before this place by a very &s;in|gular accident. After of Amphipolis had offered him his &s;ervices, telling him that he was &s;o excel|lent a mark&s;man, that he could bring down birds in their mo&s;t rapid flight. <Q REND="inline">"Well," &s;aid Philip, "I will take you into my &s;ervice, when I make war upon &s;tarlings;"</Q> which an&s;wer &s;tung the archer to the quick. He immediately threw him&s;elf into the town, and let fly an arrow, on which was written, <Q REND="inline">"To Philip's right eye."</Q> This carried a mo&s;t cruel proof of his &s;kill as an archer, for he hit Philip in the right eye; and that prince &s;ent him back the &s;ame arrow, with this in&s;crip|tion, <Q REND="inline">"If Philip takes the city, he will hang up After;"</Q> and accordingly he was as good as his word.</P>
<P>After this Philip marched to the relief of the The&s;&s;alians, who had implored his a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t their tyrant Lycophron, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of Alexander of Pherae. This man, after having acted the part of a deliverer for &s;ome time, renewed all the cruel|ties and barbarities of his predece&s;&s;or; and being &s;upported by a large body of Phocians under Oeno|marchus, he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from all oppo&s;i|tion. Philip, however, attacked him boldly; routed his army; killed &s;ix thou&s;and men upon the field of battle; and three thou&s;and Phocians, who were taken pri&s;oners, were by his order thrown into the &s;ea, as &s;acrilegious wretches, the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of religion.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="191">Having thus freed the The&s;&s;alians, he re&s;olved to carry his arms into Phocis, and with this view was going to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Thermopylae, the key of Greece, and e&s;pecially of Attica on that &s;ide: but the Athenians being informed of his intention, took care to be beforehand with him, and &s;ent a body of troops to occupy that pa&s;s; and Philip being un|willing to come as yet to an open rupture with them, thought proper for the pre&s;ent to relinqui&s;h his de&s;ign. The Athenians were rou&s;ed to this ex|ertion of &s;pirit by the per&s;ua&s;ion of Demo&s;thenes, the celebrated orator, who, from the beginning, fore&s;aw the ambitious views of Philip, and the power he had of carrying them into effect.</P>
<P>This illu&s;trious orator and &s;tate&s;man, whom we &s;hall hereafter find acting &s;o con&s;iderable a part in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, was born in the la&s;t year of the ninety-ninth olympiad. He was the &s;on not of a mean and ob&s;cure mechanic, as Juvenal has repre&s;ented him, but of an eminent Athenian citi|zen, who had rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable fortune by the making of arms. At the age of &s;even years he lo&s;t his father; and, to add to this misfortune, the guar|dians, to whom he was entru&s;ted, wa&s;ted and em|bezzled a con&s;iderable part of his inheritance. The fir&s;t &s;pecimen he gave of his abilities as a &s;peaker, was in pleading again&s;t the&s;e corrupt guardians; though here the goodne&s;s of his cau&s;e was of more avail than the force of his eloquence; for his early attempts were unpromi&s;ing, and &s;oon convinced him of the nece&s;&s;ity of a graceful and manly pronunciation. In this re&s;pect, indeed, he laboured under impediments, that, at fir&s;t &s;ight, might appear to be altogether in&s;urmountable. He had a &s;tammering in his &s;peech; but this he cor|rected by pronouncing orations with pebbles in his mouth. He had a weak and effeminate voice; but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s he &s;trengthened, by repeating &s;peeches or ver&s;es
<PB N="186" REF="192">
when he was out of breath either with running, or with walking up hill. He had an awkward and ungraceful ge&s;ture; but this he regulated and im|proved, by declaiming privately before a looking-gla&s;s. And con&s;cious of the natural aver&s;ion of the human mind to &s;ubmit to &s;evere &s;tudy, he com|pelled him&s;elf, as it were, to perform this part of his duty; for having built a clo&s;et under ground for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of his improvement, he &s;ome|times confined him&s;elf there for two or three months together; and, in order cut off all po&s;&s;ibi|lity of his coming abroad, &s;haved one half of his head while he left the other un&s;haved.</P>
<P>But even all the&s;e preparations would not have been &s;ufficient, had it not been for the &s;alutary ad|vice and in&s;tructions of the player, Satyrus. This man, having one day met Demo&s;thenes over|whelmed with &s;hame and confu&s;ion on account of his having been hi&s;&s;ed in a public a&s;&s;embly of the people, for his awkward and uncouth delivery, de&s;ired him to repeat &s;ome ver&s;es of Sophocles, which he ac|cordingly did: the other repeated them after him, but with &s;uch a different tone and accent, as fully convinced him that he knew very little of elocution. But by the in&s;tructions of Satyrus, and his own per&s;everance, he at la&s;t attained to &s;uch perfection in the art of delivery, that he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all his contemporaries as much in this, as he did in the more noble and &s;ublime parts of his profe&s;&s;ion. In a word, he &s;oon began to be looked upon as the &s;tandard of true eloquence; in&s;omuch that people flocked from all parts of Greece to hear him, and none of his countrymen have been put in competi|tion with him; nor, even among the Romans, any but Cicero. And though it has been made a que&s;|tion by the ancient writers, to which of the two they &s;hould give the preference, they have not ven|tured to decide it, but have contented them&s;elves
<PB N="187" REF="193">
with de&s;cribing their different beauties, and &s;hew|ing that they were both perfect in their kind.</P>
<P>His eloquence was grave and au&s;tere, like his temper; ma&s;culine and &s;ublime, bold, forcible and impetuous; abounding with metaphors, apo&s;tro|phes and interrogations; which, with his &s;olemn way of invoking and appealing to the gods, the planets, the elements, and the manes of tho&s;e who fell at Salamis and Marathon, had &s;uch a wonder|ful effect upon his hearers, that they thought him in&s;pired. In a word, the councils and conduct of his countrymen were &s;o much under his controul, and he had it &s;o much in his power to lead them into any mea&s;ures he thought proper to recom|mend, that Philip u&s;ed to &s;ay, he was more afraid of him than of all the fleets and armies of the Athe|nians, and that he had no enemy but Demo&s;thenes.</P>
<P>Philip, not chu&s;ing to attack the Athenians at pre&s;ent, turned his arms again&s;t their allies, par|ticularly the Olynthians, whom he ea&s;ily &s;ubdued, notwith&s;tanding a reinforcement &s;ent them from Athens; and having taken their city, he plundered it, and &s;old the inhabitants among the re&s;t of the &s;poil. His two ba&s;tard brothers, who were among the captives, he put to death, as he had formerly done the other. Ju&s;tin &s;ays, that the protection which the Olynthians had given his brothers, was the plea which he u&s;ed for attacking them.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Thebans being unable alone to terminate the war, which they had &s;o long carried on again&s;t the Phocians, addre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves to Philip, and &s;olicited his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This he readily granted them, being glad of &s;o plau&s;ible a pretext for interfering in the affairs of Greece; and de&s;iring, at the &s;ame time, to acquire the character of a religious prince; which he knew he &s;hould ea&s;ily do, by waging war again&s;t tho&s;e who were convicted of &s;acrilege. And in order to pre|vent
<PB N="188" REF="194">
the Athenians from thwarting his de&s;ign by &s;ending aid to the Phocians, he took care to amu&s;e them with propo&s;als of peace; which had &s;o good an effect, that they actually &s;ent ten amba&s;&s;adors, among whom were Ae&s;chines and Demo&s;thenes, into Macedon, to carry on the treaty. All of the&s;e, however, Philip found means to corrupt, except Demo&s;thenes: and he thus continued to pro|tract the negociation, until he had marched into Phocis, and compelled the enemy, by the terror of his name, to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>As to the allies of the Phocians, and particu|larly eight thou&s;and mercenaries from Peloponne&s;us, he allowed them to return home without mole&s;ta|tion, but the Phocians them&s;elves were left entirely at his mercy. As this, however, was an affair, in which the Greeks in general were concerned, he did not think proper to act in it by his own pri|vate authority, but referred it to the Amphictyons, whom he cau&s;ed to be a&s;&s;embled for that purpo&s;e. But they were &s;o much under his influence, that they &s;erved only to give a &s;anction to his determi|nation. They decreed, that all the cities of Phocis &s;hould be be demoli&s;hed; that they who had fled, as being principally concerned in the &s;acrilege, &s;hould be &s;tigmatized as accur&s;ed, and pro&s;cribed as outlaws; that they who remained in the towns, &s;hould be di&s;per&s;ed in villages, and obliged to pay out of their lands a yearly tribute of &s;ixty talents, until the whole of what had been taken out of the temple &s;hould be re&s;tored (for it is to be ob&s;erved, that Philomelus, their fir&s;t leader, had plundered the temple.) To add to their puni&s;hment, they were adjudged to lo&s;e their &s;eat in the council of the Amphictyons, in which they had a double voice. This Philip got transferred to him&s;elf, which was a very material point, and may be looked upon as the principal &s;tep towards his gaining that authority
<PB N="189" REF="195">
which he afterwards exerci&s;ed in the affairs of Greece. At the &s;ame time he gained, in conjunc|tion with the Thebans, the &s;uperintendency of the Pythian games, which the Corinthians had forfeited for their having taken part with the Phocians. Philip having in this manner accompli&s;hed his pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign, did not think it prudent as yet to di&s;|clo&s;e his &s;ecret views of ambition, and he therefore returned in triumph into his own country.</P>
<P>It was about this time that he performed an act of private ju&s;tice, which, in the eye of a philo&s;o|pher, ennobles his character more than all his public victories. A certain &s;oldier in the Macedonian army had, in many in&s;tances, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by extraordinary acts of valour, and had received many marks of Philip's favour and approbation. On &s;ome occa&s;ion he embarked on board a ve&s;&s;el, which was wrecked in a violent &s;torm, and he him|&s;elf ca&s;t on the &s;hore naked and helple&s;s, and &s;carcely with any &s;igns of life. A Macedonian, who&s;e lands were contiguous to the &s;ea, came opportunely to be witne&s;s of his di&s;tre&s;s, and, with all po&s;&s;ible tender|ne&s;s, flew to the relief of the unhappy &s;tranger. He bore him to his hou&s;e, laid him in his own bed, revived, cheri&s;hed, comforted, and for forty days &s;upplied him freely with all the nece&s;&s;aries and con|veniencies which his langui&s;hing condition could re|quire. The &s;oldier, thus happily re&s;cued from death, was ince&s;&s;ant in the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude to his benefactor, and a&s;&s;ured him of his intere&s;t with the king, and of his power and re&s;o|lution of obtaining for him, from the royal bounty, the noble returns which &s;uch extraordinary bene|volence de&s;erved. He was now completely reco|vered, and his kind ho&s;t &s;upplied him with money to pur&s;ue his journey. Some time after, he pre|&s;ented him&s;elf before the king; he recounted his misfortunes, magnified his &s;ervices, and having
<PB N="190" REF="196">
looked with an eye of envy on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the man who had pre&s;erved his life, was &s;o abandoned to every &s;en&s;e of gratitude, as to reque&s;t the king to be&s;tow upon him the hou&s;e and lands where he had been &s;o kindly and tenderly entertained. Un|happily Philip, without examination, incon&s;iderately granted his infamous reque&s;t; and this &s;oldier now returned to his pre&s;erver, and repaid his kindne&s;s by driving him from his &s;ettlement, and taking imme|diate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the fruits of his hone&s;t indu&s;try. The poor man, &s;tung with this in&s;tance of unparal|leled ingratitude, boldly determined to &s;eek relief; and, in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to Philip, repre&s;ented his own and the &s;oldier's conduct, in a lively and affecting manner. The king was in&s;tantly fired with indig|nation; he ordered that ju&s;tice &s;hould be done with|out delay; that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould be immedi|ately re&s;tored to the man, who&s;e charitable offices had been thus horribly repaid; and having &s;eized the &s;oldier, cau&s;ed the&s;e words to be branded on his forehead, <HI>The Ungrateful Gue&s;t:</HI> a character infa|mous in every age, and among all nations, but par|ticularly among the Greeks, who, from the earlie&s;t times, were mo&s;t &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;ervant of the laws of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>The next military operation which Philip un|dertook, was again&s;t the Cher&s;one&s;e. This penin|&s;ula had for many years belonged to the Athenians; and though Cotys, as king of the country, had lately wre&s;ted it from them, and left it to his &s;on Cher&s;opleptes, yet he being unable to defend him|&s;elf again&s;t Philip, re&s;tored it to its former ma&s;ters, and re&s;erved only to him&s;elf the capital city, Cardia. But the Cardians, afraid of falling back under the dominion of the Athenians, implored the protection of Philip, which he readily granted them. Diopi|thes, who was the chief of the Athenian colony
<PB N="191" REF="197">
lately &s;ent to the Cher&s;one&s;e, con&s;idered this pro|ceeding of Philip as an act of ho&s;tility again&s;t A|thens; and he therefore, by way of retaliation, in|vaded the maritime parts of Thrace, which Philip had lately conquered. Philip &s;ent a letter to Athens, complaining of this conduct of Diopithes, which he repre&s;ented as an infraction of the peace; and his creatures there were at great pains to &s;hew that his complaints were well founded, and that Diopi|thes had acted very improperly: but Demo&s;thenes, in a &s;peech which he made upon the occa&s;ion, and which may be con&s;idered as the foundation of all the other orations that go by the name of Philippics, proved that Diopithes had done no more than his duty; and that, in&s;tead of incurring the cen&s;ure, he c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ght to receive the thanks of his country.</P>
<P>Philip, however, was no way intimidated by the wordy re&s;i&s;tance of his eloquent antagoni&s;t; but proceeding &s;till to extend his influence among the different &s;tates of Greece, he offered his protection to the Me&s;&s;enians and Argives, who had been op|pre&s;&s;ed by the Spartans; and the&s;e being &s;oon men joined by the Thebans, formed all together a very powerful confederacy. The natural balance again&s;t it was an union between Athens and Sparta, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ch the Spartans pre&s;&s;ed with great eagerne&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Philip and the Thebans did all they could to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ent. But Demo&s;thenes exerting him&s;elf with great &s;pirit, rou&s;ed up the Athenians, and put them &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their guard, that, without coming to an open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with Philip, they obliged him for the pre|&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t to remain quiet.</P>
<P>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">et, however, he could not long continue. He re&s;tle&s;s and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit was ever at work. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad long fixed his eye upon the I&s;land of Euboea, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> being very conveniently &s;ituated for favouring the re&s;ign he had formed again&s;t Greece; and he now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ntrived, upon pretence of an invitation from

&s;ome of the inhabitants, to &s;end a body of troops thither; by which means he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of &s;e|veral &s;trong places, di&s;mantled Porthmos, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed three tyrants, or kings, over the country. The Athenians were conjured, in this di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation, by Plutarch of Eretria, to come to the relief of the inhabitants; and they accordingly di&s;|patched a few troops thither under the command of Phocion, a general of whom great hopes were enter|tained, and who&s;e conduct ju&s;tified the high opinion the public had of him.</P>
<P>This man would have done honour to the earlie&s;t and mo&s;t uncorrupt times of the Athenian &s;tate. His manners were formed in the academy, accord|ing to the rules of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t rigid virtue. It is &s;aid, that no one ever &s;aw him laugh, or weep, or deviate in the lea&s;t from the mo&s;t &s;ettled gravity and compo&s;ure. He learned the art of war under Chabrias, and frequently moderated the exce&s;&s;es, and corrected the errors of that general: his humanity he admired and imitated, and taught him to ex|erci&s;e it in a more liberal and exten&s;ive manner. When he had received his directions to &s;ail, with twenty &s;hips, to collect the contributions of the allies and dependent cities, <Q REND="inline">"Why this force?" &s;aid Phocion; or if I am to meet them as enemies, it is in&s;ufficient; if as friends and allies, a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el will &s;erve."</Q> He bore the hard&s;hips of a mi|litary life with &s;o much ea&s;e, that if ever he appeared warmly clothed, the &s;oldiers at once pronounced it the &s;ign of a cold &s;ea&s;on. His outward appearance was forbidding, and his enemies taking advantage of this circum&s;tance, &s;ometimes reproached him with his &s;upercilious a&s;pect; and one day when Chares did &s;o, and the Athenians &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the &s;arca&s;m, Phocion quickly replied, <Q REND="inline">"The &s;ternne&s;s of my countenance never made any of you &s;ad, but the mirth of the&s;e &s;neerers has co&s;t you

many a tear."</Q> In popular a&s;&s;emblies, his lively, clo&s;e, and natural manner of &s;peaking &s;eemed, as it were, the echo of the &s;implicity and integrity of his mind, and had frequently a greater effect, than even the dignity and energy of Demo&s;thenes, who called him the pruning-hook of his periods. He &s;tudied only good &s;en&s;e and plain rea&s;oning, and de&s;pi&s;ed every adventitious ornament. He was &s;en|&s;ible of the depravity of his countrymen, and ever treated them with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. He defied their cen&s;ures; and &s;o far did he affect to de&s;pi&s;e their applau&s;e, that once, when his &s;entiments ex|torted their approbation, he turned about in &s;urpri&s;e, and a&s;ked a friend, If any thing weak or imperti|nent had e&s;caped him? His fondne&s;s for pacific mea&s;ures aro&s;e from a thorough per&s;ua&s;ion of the degeneracy of his countrymen. He &s;aw the de&s;igns of Philip, but imagined that the &s;tate was too cor|rupted to give him any effectual oppo&s;ition; &s;o that he was, according to Demo&s;thenes in his third Philippic, of the number of tho&s;e men, who gave up the intere&s;ts of the republic, not ignorantly or corruptly, but from a melancholy conviction of the indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ity of yielding to the fatality of the times, and of &s;ubmitting to an event which could not be avoided. He was, of con&s;equence, ever of the party oppo&s;ite to Demo&s;thenes; and having been taught, by experience, to &s;u&s;pect the popular leaders, con&s;idered his earne&s;tne&s;s to rou&s;e the Athenians to arms, only as an artifice to embroil the &s;tate, and by that means to gain an a&s;cendant in the public a&s;&s;emblies. <Q REND="inline">"Phocion," &s;aid De|mo&s;thenes, "the people, in &s;ome mad fit, will &s;acri|fice you to their fury."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes," replied he, "and you will be their victim, if ever they come to their &s;en&s;es."</Q> Yet they often prevailed on him to act again&s;t his judgment, though never to &s;peak again&s;t his con|&s;cience. He never refu&s;ed or declined the com|mand, whatever might be his opinion of the expe|dition.
<PB N="194" REF="200">
Forty-five times was he cho&s;en to lead their armies, generally in his ab&s;ence, and ever without the lea&s;t application. They knew his merit; and, in the hour of danger, forgot that &s;everity with which he u&s;ually treated their inclinations and opi|nions.</P>
<P>It was to him the Athenians gave the command of the forces they &s;ent to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Plutarch. But this traitor repaid his benefactors with ingrati|tude; he &s;et up his &s;tandard again&s;t them, and en|deavoured openly to repul&s;e the very army he had reque&s;ted. Phocion, however, was not at a lo&s;s how to behave to &s;uch a renegado; he pur&s;ued his enterpri&s;e, won a battle, and drove Plutarch from Eretria.</P>
<P>Philip, di&s;appointed in his de&s;igns upon Euboea, endeavoured to di&s;tre&s;s the Athenians in another quarter. He well knew, that they had mo&s;t of their &s;upplies of corn from Thrace; and he, there|fore, re&s;olved to &s;hut up the ports of that country again&s;t them, and particularly to make him&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ma&s;ter of Perinthus and Byzantium. Unwilling, however, &s;till to break with them entirely, he took care to amu&s;e them with profe&s;&s;ions of his regard, and of his extreme reluctance to give them the lea&s;t offence. Nay, he wrote them a letter, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, in which he &s;trongly in&s;inuated that they, and not he, were the violators of the peace. <Q REND="inline">"In the times of great enmity," &s;ays he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "the mo&s;t you did was to fit out &s;hips of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t me, and to &s;eize and &s;ell the merchant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that come to trade in my dominions; but now yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> carry your hatred and inju&s;tice to &s;uch prodigiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lengths, as even to &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to the king o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Per&s;ia, to make him declare again&s;t me."</Q></P>
<P>This letter gave &s;uch of the orators, as were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Philip's intere&s;t, a fine opportunity of ju&s;tifyin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his conduct.

&s;till continued to expo&s;e his artful de&s;igns; and, in or|der to remove the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions which the peru&s;al of this letter might make, he immediately a&s;cended the tribunal, and from thence harangued the people with all the thunder of his eloquence. He told them, the letter was written in a &s;tyle not &s;uitable to the people of Athens; that it was a plain decla|ration of war again&s;t them; that Philip had long &s;ince made the &s;ame declaration by his actions; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat, by the peace he had concluded with them, he meant nothing more than a bare ce&s;&s;ation of arms, and to fall upon them afre&s;h when they were more unprepared. From thence he proceeded to his u&s;ual topic, of reproving them for their &s;loth, and &s;uffer|ing them&s;elves to be deluded by their orators who were in Philip's pay. <Q REND="inline">"Convinced of the&s;e truths," continued he, "O Athenians, and &s;trongly per|&s;uaded, that we can no longer &s;ay with propriety that we enjoy peace (for Philip has now declared war again&s;t us by his letter, as he has long &s;ince done by his conduct) you ought not to &s;pare either the public trea&s;ure, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of private per|&s;ons, but, when occa&s;ion &s;hall require, ha&s;te to your re&s;pective &s;tandards, and &s;et abler generals at your head, than tho&s;e you have hitherto employed: for no one among you ought to imagine, that the &s;ame men who have ruined your affairs, will have abilities to re&s;tore them to their former happy &s;ituation. Think how infamous it is, that a man from Ma|cedon &s;hould contemn dangers to &s;uch a degree, that, merely to aggrandize his empire, he &s;hould ru&s;h into the mid&s;t of combats, and return from battle covered with wounds; and that the Athe|nians, who&s;e hereditary right it is to obey no man, but to impo&s;e law on others, &s;word in hand; that the Athenians, I &s;ay, merely through dejection of &s;pirit and indolence, &s;hould degenerate from the
<PB N="196" REF="202">
glory of their ance&s;tors, and abandon the intere&s;t of their country!"</Q></P>
<P>Though Phocion &s;eldom agreed with Demo&s;t|henes in any thing, he heartily a&s;&s;ented to what he had now &s;aid. He further urged the incapacity of the generals already cho&s;en; and the&s;e being rejected, he him&s;elf was appointed to command the troops that were to go again&s;t Philip, who was &s;till be|&s;ieging Byzantium.</P>
<P>Phocion's conduct, on this occa&s;ion, did not de|tract from the high character he had already acquir|ed; and he was nobly &s;upported by his officers and &s;oldiers, who had an entire confidence in his gal|lantry and good fortune. He obliged Philip to give over the &s;iege; he drove him out of the Hel|le&s;pont; he took &s;ome of his &s;hips; he recovered many fortre&s;&s;es which he had &s;eized; and having made &s;everal de&s;cents upon different parts of his ter|ritories, he plundered all the open country, till a body of forces a&s;&s;embling to oppo&s;e him, he thought proper to retire.</P>
<P>Philip having met with &s;o &s;evere a check in Greece, turned his arms again&s;t the Scythians, whom he ea&s;ily defeated; but, in his return from Scythia, he was obliged to come to an engagement with the Triballi, when he received a wound in his thigh, and had his hor&s;e killed under him. Alex|ander, who accompanied him in this expedition immediately flew to his father's relief, and cover|ing him with his &s;hield, killed or put to flight al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> who attacked him.</P>
<P>The Athenians con&s;idered the &s;iege of Byzan|tium as an open declaration of war; and therefore in order to retaliate upon Philip, they blocked u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his ports by &s;ea, and put an entire &s;top to his com+merce. Philip at fir&s;t endeavoured to appea&s;e them by offering them terms of peace, which Phocion with his u&s;ual moderation, advi&s;ed them to accep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="197" REF="203">
but Demo&s;thenes per&s;uaded them to reject with in|dignation. Philip, therefore, began to form new alliances again&s;t them, particularly with the The|bans and The&s;&s;alians; but knowing how difficult it would be to per&s;uade the&s;e powers to act directly again&s;t Athens, merely on account of his per&s;onal quarrels, he took care to &s;upply them with a more plau&s;ible pretext for embracing &s;uch a mea&s;ure. He found means, by his artifice and intrigues, to &s;ow di&s;&s;en&s;ions between the Locrians of Amphi&s;&s;a and their capital city. They were accu&s;ed of im|piety, in having ploughed up a &s;pot of &s;acred ground which lay near the temple of Apollo, in the &s;ame manner as the Phocians had done upon a former occa&s;ion. This &s;park, which at fir&s;t might ea&s;ily have been extingui&s;hed, Ae&s;chines, the mo&s;t cele|brated orator of his time next to Demo&s;thenes, and who was entirely in the intere&s;t of Philip, contrived to blow up into a flame; and, by his advice, a re|&s;olution was taken to &s;end a &s;olemn deputation to Philip, inviting him to a&s;&s;i&s;t Apollo and the Am|phictyons, and to repel the outrages of the impious Amphi&s;&s;aeans; and further to declare, that he was con&s;tituted, by the Greeks, a member of the coun|cil of Amphictyons, and general and commander of their forces, with full and unlimited powers.</P>
<P>This was the very &s;tation which Philip had long a&s;pired to, and now thought him&s;elf &s;upremely happy in having attained. Mo&s;t of the inferior &s;tates of Greece approved of the conduct of the Amphictyons, in giving the command of their forces to a man, &s;o eminent and illu&s;trious for his piety, and &s;o capable of executing the vengeance of hea|ven. The Athenians and Spartans, however, con|&s;idered the matter in a very different light. They &s;aw, that while Philip openly affected to vindicate the honour of Apollo, he was &s;ecretly promoting the views of his own ambition; and that under pre|tence
<PB N="198" REF="204">
of aiding one part of the Greeks again&s;t the other, he was in reality forging chains for the whole. Nor was it long before their &s;u&s;picions were ju&s;ti|fied by the event; for Philip had no &s;ooner a&s;&s;embled his forces, than in&s;tead of marching, as he had pro|mi&s;ed, again&s;t the irreverent Locrians, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Elatea, a capital city of Phocis, which was very conveniently &s;ituated for awing the Thebans, of whom he began to grow jealous, and for opening to him a way into the heart of Attica. By &s;o extraordinary and unexpected a &s;tep he fairly threw off the ma&s;k, and bade defiance, as it were, to the whole body of Grecians.</P>
<P>The news of this tran&s;action quickly &s;pread into the neighbouring countries, and, wherever it came, filled the minds of the people with terror and con&s;ternation. They now plainly perceived the de&s;igns of Philip, which his artifice and their own &s;tupidity had hitherto concealed from their eyes; but they were at a lo&s;s to know what &s;teps they ought to take, in order to ren|der them abortive. Nay, even the Athenians them&s;elves, though they had long apprehended &s;ome &s;uch event, were as much confounded and alarmed as their neighbours. For when they met in a ge|neral a&s;&s;embly, in order to deliberate upon the pre|&s;ent critical &s;ituation of affairs, and the herald, as u&s;ual, demanded with a loud voice, <Q REND="inline">"which among them would a&s;cend the tribunal,"</Q> not one of them had the courage to ri&s;e, or open his mouth; till at la&s;t Demo&s;thenes, animated with the greatne&s;s of the approaching danger, and fired with that noble &s;pi|rit of indignation, which he had ever cheri&s;hed and avowed again&s;t the in&s;idious de&s;igns of Philip, aro&s;e, and addre&s;&s;ed the people in the following terms. <Q REND="inline">"Athenians! permit me to explain the circum|&s;tances of that &s;tate which Philip has &s;eized upon.

What then is his de&s;ign? By drawing up his forces, and di&s;playing his powers on the borders of Thebes, he hopes to in&s;pire his adherents with courage and a&s;&s;urance, and to terrify and controul his adver&s;aries, that fear or force may drive them into tho&s;e mea|&s;ures which they have hitherto oppo&s;ed. If then we are re&s;olved, in this conjuncture, to cheri&s;h the remembrance of every act of unkindne&s;s which the Thebans have done to Athens; if we regard them with &s;u&s;picion, as men who have ranged them|&s;elves on the &s;ide of our enemy; in the fir&s;t place we &s;hall act agreeably to Philip's warme&s;t wi&s;hes; and then I am apprehen&s;ive, that the party, who now oppo&s;e him, may be brought over to his in|tere&s;t; the whole city &s;ubmit unanimou&s;ly to his direction; and Thebes and Macedon fall, with their united force, on Attica. Grant the due atten|tion to what I now propo&s;e; let it be calmly weigh|ed without di&s;pute or cavil, and I doubt not but my coun&s;els may direct you to the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;alutary mea&s;ures, and di&s;pel the dangers now im|pending over the &s;tate. What then do I recom|mend? Fir&s;t, &s;hake off that terror which hath po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed your minds; and, in&s;tead of fearing for your|&s;elves, let the Thebans be the objects of your ap|prehen&s;ions: they are more immediately affected; they are the fir&s;t to feel the dangers. In the next place, all tho&s;e of the age for military &s;ervice, both infantry and cavalry, &s;hould march in&s;tantly to Eleu&s;is, that Greece may &s;ee, that you al&s;o are a&s;&s;embled in arms; and your friends in Thebes be emboldened to a&s;&s;ert their rights, when they are a&s;&s;ured, that as they, who have &s;old their country to the Macedonians, have a force at Elatea to &s;up|port them, &s;o you are ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the men who bravely contend for liberty. In the la&s;t place, I recommend to you to nominate ten amba&s;&s;adors, who, with the generals, may have full authority to

determine the time, and all other circum&s;tances of this march. When the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors arrive at Thebes, how are they to conduct this great affair? This is a point worthy of your mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion. Make no demands on the Thebans; at this conjuncture it would be di&s;honourable: a&s;&s;ure them that your a&s;&s;i&s;tance is ready for their acceptance, as you are deeply concerned for their danger, and have been &s;o happy as to fore&s;ee and to guard again&s;t it. It they approve of your &s;entiments, and em|brace your overtures, we &s;hall effect one great pur|po&s;e, and act with a dignity worthy of our &s;tate. But &s;hould it happen that we are not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, whatever misfortunes may befal them, to them&s;elves alone they &s;hall be imputed; while your conduct &s;hall appear, in no one in&s;tance, incon&s;i&s;tent with the honour and renown of Athens."</Q></P>
<P>This &s;peech, dictated by the feelings of a patri|otic heart, and delivered with all that fire and vehe|mence for which the orator was &s;o remarkable, im|mediately produced the de&s;ired effect. The Athe|nians determined to follow the advice that had been now given them; they appointed Demo&s;thenes him|&s;elf to head the emba&s;&s;y to be &s;ent to Thebes; and they re&s;olved to fit out a fleet of two hundred &s;ail, to cruize near Thermopylae.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival at Thebes, Demo&s;thenes found him&s;elf oppo&s;ed by one Python, a man of con&s;ider|able abilties, whom Philip had purpo&s;ely &s;ent thither to counteract the de&s;igns of the Athenian orator. This, however, he was not able to effect. The ma&s;culine eloquence of Demo&s;thenes carried all be|fore it, and in&s;pired the Thebans with &s;o &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion for liberty, that they re&s;olved to join their forces with tho&s;e of the Athenians, in preventing the further progre&s;s of the Macedonian arms.</P>
<P>Philip, di&s;concerted by the union of two &s;uch powerful &s;tates, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Athenians, re|que&s;ting
<PB N="201" REF="207">
them to de&s;i&s;t from their warlike prepara|tions; but finding them determined to adhere to their engagements with Thebes, he endeavoured to intimidate both them and and their allies with omens and predictions, which he took care to pro|cure from the prie&s;te&s;s of Apollo. Demo&s;thenes, however, per&s;uaded them to pay no regard to the&s;e ridiculous oracles. He told them, the prie&s;te&s;s Philipized, thereby in&s;inuating, that it was Philip's money that in&s;pired her, and that opened her mouth, and made her draw from Apollo whatever an&s;wers &s;he thought proper. He bade the Thebans remember their Epaminondas, and the Athenians their Pericles, who con&s;idered the&s;e oracles and pre|dictions as idle &s;carecrows, and con&s;ulted only their rea&s;on. The Athenian army &s;et out immedi|ately, and marched to Eleu&s;is; and the Thebans, &s;urpri&s;ed at the diligence of their confederates, joined them, and waited the approach of the enemy.</P>
<P>Philip, con&s;cious of his own abilities, and at the &s;ame time convinced of the extreme weakne&s;s of tho&s;e who commanded the allied army, determined to bring on a general engagement as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible; and with this view advanced into the plain of Chaeronea, a place rendered famous by the event of this important conte&s;t. His army amounted to about thirty-two thou&s;and men; that of the con|&s;ederates did not exceed thirty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>On the eve of the day on which this deci&s;ive battle was fought, Diogenes, the cynic, who had long looked with equal contempt on either party, was led by curio&s;ity to vi&s;it the camps, as an un|concerned &s;pectator. In the Macedonian camp, where his per&s;on and character were not known, he was &s;topped by the guards, and conducted to Phi|lip's tent. The king a&s;ked him &s;ternly whether he came as a &s;py: <Q REND="inline">"Yes, &s;aid Diogenes, I am
<PB N="202" REF="208">
come to &s;py upon your folly and ambition, in thus &s;etting your life and kingdom to the hazard of an hour."</Q></P>
<P>And now the fatal morning appeared, which was for ever to decide the cau&s;e of liberty and the em|pire of Greece. Before the ri&s;ing of the &s;un both armies were ranged in order of battle. The The|bans, with the &s;acred band in front, occupied the right wing of the confederate Greeks; the Athe|nians, commanded by Ly&s;icles and Chares, formed the left; and the Corinthians and Peloponne&s;ians were po&s;ted in the centre. On the left of the Ma|cedonian army &s;tood Alexander, at the head of a cho&s;en body of noble Macedonians, &s;upported by the famous cavalry of The&s;&s;aly. In the centre were placed tho&s;e Greeks who had united with Phi|lip, and on who&s;e courage he could lea&s;t depend; while the king him&s;elf commanded on the right, where his renowned phalanx &s;tood, to oppo&s;e the mpetuo&s;ity with which the Athenians were well known to begin their on&s;et.</P>
<P>The charge began on each &s;ide with all the cou|rage and violence, which ambition, revenge, the love of glory, and the love of liberty, could excite in the &s;everal combatants. Alexander, at the head of the Macedonian nobles, fir&s;t fell, with all the fury of youthful courage, on the &s;acred band of Thebes; which &s;u&s;tained the attack with a bravery and vigour worthy of its former fame. The gallant youths who compo&s;ed this body, not being timely, or duly &s;upported by their countrymen, bore up for a while again&s;t the torrent of the enemy; till at length, oppre&s;&s;ed and overpowered by &s;uperior num|bers, without yielding or turning their backs on their a&s;&s;ailants, they &s;unk down on that ground where they had been originally &s;tationed, each by the &s;ide of his darling friend, rai&s;ing up a bulwark by their bodies again&s;t the progre&s;s of the enemy.
<PB N="203" REF="209">
But the young prince and his forces, in all the en|thu&s;ia&s;tic ardour of valour, animated by &s;ucce&s;s, pu&s;hed on through all the carnage, and over all the heaps of &s;lain, and fell furiou&s;ly on the main body of the Thebans; where they were oppo&s;ed with ob|&s;tinate and deliberate courage, and the conte&s;t was, for &s;ome time, &s;upported with equal re&s;olution on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Athenians, on the left wing, fought with a &s;pirit and intrepidity worthy of the character which they boa&s;ted, and of the cau&s;e by which they were animated. Many gal|lant efforts were made by either party, and &s;ucce&s;s was for &s;ome time doubtful; till at length part of the centre, and the right wing of the Macedonians (except the phalanx) yielded to the impetuous attack of the Athenians, and fled with &s;ome precipitation. Happy had it been that day for Greece, if the con|duct and abilities of the Grecian generals had been equal to the valour of their &s;oldiers! But tho&s;e brave champions of liberty were led on by the de&s;|picable creatures of intrigue and cabal. Tran|&s;ported by the advantage now obtained, the pre|&s;umptuous Ly&s;icles cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Come on, my gal|lant countrymen; the victory is ours; let us pur&s;ue the&s;e cowards, and drive them back to Macedon;"</Q> and thus, in&s;tead of improving the happy opportu|nity, by charging the phalanx in flank, and &s;o breaking this formidable body, the Athenians wildly and precipitately pre&s;&s;ed forward, in pur&s;uit of the flying enemy, them&s;elves in all the tumult and di&s;|order of a rout.</P>
<P>Philip &s;aw this fatal error with all the contempt of a &s;kilful general, and the &s;ecret exultation ari&s;ing from the a&s;&s;urance of approaching victory. He coolly ob&s;erved to tho&s;e officers that &s;tood round him, that the Athenians knew not how to conquer; and ordered his phalanx to change its po&s;ition, and, by
<PB N="204" REF="210">
a &s;udden evolution, to gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an adja|cent eminence. From thence they marched deli|berately down, firm and collected, and fell, with their united force, on the Athenians, now confi|dent of &s;ucce&s;s, and blind to their danger. The &s;hock was irre&s;i&s;tible; they were at once over|whelmed; many of them lay cru&s;hed by the weight of the enemy, and expiring of their wounds; while the re&s;t e&s;caped from the dreadful &s;laughter, by a &s;hameful and precipitate flight; bearing down, and hurrying along with them, tho&s;e troops which had been &s;tationed for their &s;upport. And here it was, that the great orator and &s;tate&s;man, who had excited his countrymen to make this glorious &s;truggle in defence of their liberty, tarni&s;hed all the honours he had acquired in the &s;enate by his pu&s;illanimity in the field. He took to flight the very fir&s;t on&s;et; and throwing away his &s;hield, on which were in&s;cribed the&s;e words To Good For|tune, he appeared among the foremo&s;t in the ge|neral rout. The ridicule and malice of his enemies related, or perhaps invented, another &s;hameful cir|cum&s;tance; that being impeded in his flight by &s;ome brambles, his imagination was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the pre&s;ence of the enemy, that he loudly cried out for quarter.</P>
<P>While Philip was thus triumphant on his &s;ide, Alexander continued the conflict on the other wing, and at length broke the Thebans, in &s;pite of all their acts of valour, who now fled from the field, and were pur&s;ued with great carnage. The center of the confederates was thus totally abandoned to the fury of a victorious enemy. But enough of &s;laughter had already been made: more than one thou&s;and of the Athenians lay dead on the field of battle, two thou&s;and were made pri&s;oners, and the lo&s;s of the Thebans was not inferior. Phi|lip, therefore, determined to conclude his impor|tant
<PB N="205" REF="211">
victory by an act of apparent clemency, which his policy and ambition really dictated. He gave orders that the Greeks &s;hould be &s;pared, carefully locking up in his own brea&s;t the de&s;ign he had formed again&s;t their liberties, and hoping one day to march at their head to accompli&s;h the conque&s;t of the Per&s;ian monarchy.</P>
<P>Philip's behaviour, upon obtaining this victory, is differently repre&s;ented by different hi&s;torians. Some &s;ay, that he expre&s;&s;ed his joy in &s;o extrava|gant and even ludicrous a manner, as to extort from Demades, one of the Athenian pri&s;oners, the following &s;evere reprimand&mdash;"Fortune," &s;aid that orator to him, <Q REND="inline">"has given you the part of Aga|memnon, but you are acting that of Ther&s;ites."</Q> Ju&s;tin, however, repre&s;ents his conduct in a more amiable and engaging light. He &s;ays, that he was at great pains to di&s;&s;emble his joy; that he affected extreme mo|de&s;ty, and the utmo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion for the pri&s;oners; that he was not even &s;een to laugh; that he would have no &s;acrifice, no crowns, no perfumes; that he forbade all kinds of &s;ports; and did nothing that might make him appear to the conquerors to be elated, nor to the conquered to be in&s;olent. Cer|tain it is, that he immediately concluded a peace with the Athenians; and though he treated the Thebans, as unfaithful allies, with greater &s;everity, yet, after compelling them to pay a ran&s;om for their pri&s;oners, and a large &s;um of money for leave to bury their dead, and after placing a garri&s;on in their citadel, he agreed to make a peace with them al&s;o.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that I&s;ocrates, the celebrated rhetori|cian, was &s;o deeply affected when he heard of the lo&s;s of the battle of Chaeronea, that unable to &s;ur|vive the di&s;grace which that event had brought upon his country, he ha&s;tened his end by ab&s;taining from
<PB N="206" REF="212">
all kind of food: he was then in the ninety-eighth year of his age.</P>
<P>Ly&s;icles, who had the chief command of the Athenians in this engagement, and by who&s;e mi&s;|conduct the battle had been lo&s;t, was &s;oon after &s;ummoned before an a&s;&s;embly of the people, and was condemned to die at the in&s;tance of Lycurgus, who had great credit and influence in the city, but was a &s;evere judge, and a mo&s;t bitter accu&s;er. <Q REND="inline">"You, Ly&s;icles," &s;aid he, "were general of the army; a thou&s;and citizens were &s;lain, two thou&s;and taken pri&s;oners; a trophy has been erected to the di&s;honour of this city, and all Greece is en&s;laved. You had the command when all the&s;e things hap|pened; and yet you dare to live, and view the light of the &s;un, and blu&s;h not to appear publicly in the Forum; you, Ly&s;icles, who are born the mo|nument of your country's &s;hame."</Q> This Lycurgus, who did not di&s;grace the name which he bore, was one of the fir&s;t orators of the age, and was &s;till more remarkable for the integrity of his life than the force of his eloquence. For, after having managed the public trea&s;ure for the &s;pace of twelve years, he cau&s;ed an exact regi&s;ter of every thing he had done during his whole admini&s;tration to be fixed up on a pillar, that every body might &s;ee it, and cen&s;ure it if they plea&s;ed. Nay, he carried this point &s;o far, that, in his la&s;t illne&s;s, he ordered him&s;elf to be carried to the &s;enate-hou&s;e, to give a public ac|count of all his actions; and, after having refuted one who accu&s;ed him there, he went home and died. Though naturally grave and even au&s;tere in his temper, he was a great encourager of the &s;tage; and, as a proof of his regard for dramatic writers, he erected the &s;tatues of Ae&s;chylus, So|phocles, and Euripides.</P>
<P>Chares, who was probably as guilty as Ly&s;icles, appears to have e&s;caped merely through the in&s;ig|nificance

of his character. Indeed, his abilities were &s;o contemptible, that, according to Timo|theus, <Q REND="inline">"he was much fitter to carry the general's baggage, than to be a general him&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Many people thought, that Demo&s;thenes might, on account of his &s;peeches, be con&s;idered as the real cau&s;e of the terrible blow which Athens had now &s;u&s;tained, and that upon him therefore would certainly fall the principal weight of the natural re|&s;entment. But in this they were di&s;appointed. The Athenians were &s;o fully conviced of his in|tegrity and patrioti&s;m, that, at the very moment they were &s;marting under the wound they had ju&s;t re|ceived, they &s;ubmitted entirely to his coun&s;els and direction. Indeed, he appears to have been highly de&s;erving of all the confidence they repo&s;ed in him. For being appointed, at this time, to &s;upply the city with provi&s;ions, and to repair the walls, he ex|ecuted the latter commi&s;&s;ion with &s;o much genero|&s;ity, that as the public trea&s;ure was unequal to the expence, he made up the deficiency out of his own private fortune.</P>
<P>It was for this in&s;tance of public &s;pirit, that his friend Cte&s;iphon propo&s;ed in an a&s;&s;embly of the people, that a crown of gold &s;hould be be&s;towed upon him; and this gave ri&s;e to the celebrated con|te&s;t between Ae&s;chines and Demo&s;thenes, one of the mo&s;t remarkable that is to be found in hi&s;tory. Ae&s;chines, the declared rival of Demo&s;thenes, not only in eloquence but in politics, brought an accu|&s;ation again&s;t Cte&s;iphon for the propo&s;al he had made in favour of his friend, who naturally defended the equity of the mea&s;ure, in which he thought his own honour &s;o e&s;&s;entially concerned.</P>
<P>No cau&s;e ever excited &s;o much curio&s;ity, or was pleaded with &s;o much ability. People flocked to it from all parts, and they had good rea&s;on for &s;o doing; for what &s;ight could be nobler, than a con|flict
<PB N="208" REF="214">
between two orators, each of them excellent in his way, both formed by nature, improved by art, and animated by perpetual di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and an implacable animo&s;ity again&s;t each other. The junc|ture &s;eemed to favour Ae&s;chines very much; for the Macedonian party, whom he always befriended, was very powerful in Athens, e&s;pecially &s;ince the ruin of Thebes. Neverthele&s;s, he lo&s;t his cau&s;e, and was ju&s;tly &s;entenced to bani&s;hment for his ra&s;h ac|cu&s;ation. He thereupon went and &s;ettled him&s;elf at Rhodes, where he opened a &s;chool of eloquence, the fame and glory of which continued for many ages. He began his lectures with the two orations that had occa&s;ioned his bani&s;hment. Great enco|miums were pa&s;&s;ed upon that of Ae&s;chines; but when he repeated the &s;peech of Demo&s;thenes, the plaudits and acclamations were redoubled. And it was then he uttered the&s;e words, &s;o highly prai&s;e-worthy in the mouth of a rival: <Q REND="inline">"Alas, what un|bounded applau&s;es would you have be&s;towed on this &s;peech, had you heard Demo&s;thenes deliver it him&s;elf?"</Q></P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes, thus become victor, made a good u&s;e of his conque&s;t. For the in&s;tant Ae&s;chines left Athens, in order to embark for Rhodes, Demo&s;t|henes ran after him, and forced him to accept of a pur&s;e of money. On this occa&s;ion, Ae&s;chines cried out, <Q REND="inline">"How will it be po&s;&s;ible for me not to regret a country, in which I leave an enemy more generous, than I can hope to find friends in any other part of the world?"</Q></P>
<P>In the mean time, Philip had his ambition plea&s;ed, but not &s;atisfied, with his la&s;t victory. The &s;ove|reignty of Greece, even if he had acquired it, he always con&s;idered but as a &s;econdary object, and only as the means of preparing his way for the con|que&s;t of Per&s;ia, which he had long planned in his mind, and hoped to be able one day to accompli&s;h.
<PB N="209" REF="215">
But this he knew he could not do without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the Greeks, which, however, he thought he could the more ea&s;ily procure for &s;uch an under|taking, as they had long burned with an ardent de|&s;ire of revenging upon Per&s;ia the injuries they had received from it, and of working the total di&s;truc|tion of that empire. Philip, therefore, now pro|po&s;ing to lead them to &s;uch a glorious gratification of their revenge, they readily cho&s;e him generali&s;&s;imo of their forces; and he, accordingly, began to make preparations for invading the dominions of the Per&s;ian monarch.</P>
<P>But while Philip was thus &s;ucce&s;sful in his pub|lic undertakings, the violent di&s;&s;en&s;ions, that reigned in his family, de&s;troyed all his private peace, and at la&s;t brought him to an untimely end. He had married Olympias, the daughter of the king of Epirus, and the early part of their union was crowned with happine&s;s; but as &s;he was naturally of a peevi&s;h and vindictive di&s;po&s;ition, a coldne&s;s fir&s;t, and afterwards a rooted aver&s;ion took place between them. This was probably ha&s;tened by the pa&s;&s;ion which Philip had conceived for Cleopatra, niece to Attalus, one of his principal officers. In a word, his love to this lady, and his aver&s;ion to Olympias, grew at la&s;t &s;o &s;trong, that he re&s;olved to e&s;pou&s;e the former, after having divorced the latter. In vain did Alexander his &s;on remon&s;trate, that by divorcing Olympias, and engaging in a &s;e|cond marriage, he expo&s;ed him to the danger of contending with a number of competitors for the crown, and rendered his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion precarious. <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, &s;aid the king, if I create you a number of competitors, you will have the glorious opportunity of exerting your&s;elf to &s;urpa&s;s them all in merit: thus &s;hall their rival&s;hip only render you more worthy of the throne."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="216">His marriage with Cleopatra was now declared in form, and celebrated with all the pomp and magni|ficence which the occa&s;ion required. The young prince, however di&s;&s;atisfied, was yet obliged to at|tend on the&s;e &s;olemnities, and &s;at in &s;ilent indigna|tion at that fea&s;t which proclaimed the di&s;grace of his mother. In &s;uch circum&s;tances, his youthful and impetuous mind could not fail to take fire at any the lea&s;t &s;hadow of in&s;ult. Attalus, uncle to the new queen, was &s;o unguarded as, in the mid&s;t of the entertainment, to call aloud upon the Macedo|nian nobles, to pour out their libations to the gods, that they might grant the king the happy fruits of the pre&s;ent nuptials, and legitimate heirs to his throne. <Q REND="inline">"Wretch! cried Alexander, with his eyes &s;parkling with that indignation which he had till now &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, do&s;t thou then call me ba&s;tard?"</Q> And in&s;tantly darted his goblet at Attalus, who re|turned the outrage with double violence. Clamour and confu&s;ion aro&s;e, and the king, in a &s;udden fit of rage, &s;natched his &s;word, and flew directly to|wards his &s;on. His precipitation, his lamene&s;s (for he had been wounded in the battle with the Triballi) and the quantity of wine in which he had indulged, happily di&s;appointed his ra&s;h purpo&s;e: he &s;tumbled and fell on the floor, while Alexander, with an un|pardonable in&s;olence, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"Behold, ye Ma|cedonians! this is the king who is preparing to lead you into A&s;ia; &s;ee where, in pa&s;&s;ing from one table to another, he is fallen to the ground."</Q></P>
<P>Philip, however, did not lo&s;e &s;ight of the con|que&s;t of A&s;ia. Full of the mighty project, he con|&s;ulted the gods, to know what would be the event of it; and the prie&s;te&s;s replied, <Q REND="inline">"The victim is already crowned, his end draws nigh, and he will &s;oon be &s;acrificed."</Q> Philip interpreted this oracle in his own favour; though the ambiguity of it might have made him &s;u&s;pect its meaning, and that it was
<PB N="211" REF="217">
as applicable to &s;ome other event as to the conque&s;t of A&s;ia. The fact is, it &s;oon after appeared, that it was more applicable to him&s;elf than to the Per&s;ian monarch. For while he was celebrating the nup|tials of his daughter Cleopatra, with Alexander, king of Epirus, and brother to his queen Olympias, he was &s;uddenly &s;tabbed in the height of the &s;olem|nity, and in the mid&s;t of his guards, by one Pau|&s;anias, a noble Macedonian, whom Attalus, his favourite general, had cruelly abu&s;ed, and who having repeatedly demanded reparation of the king in vain, at la&s;t turned the edge of his re&s;entment from the author of his wrong to his &s;overeign him|&s;elf, and took this dreadful method of &s;atiating his revenge.</P>
<P>Olympias is &s;uppo&s;ed to have in&s;tigated Pau&s;anias to this de&s;perate act. Certain it is, that when his dead body (for he was in&s;tantly di&s;patched by the guards) was hung up on a gibbet, it appeared next morning crowned with a golden diadem; a mark of re&s;pect, which no one could have ventured to &s;hew to it but Olympias. In a few days after, &s;he took a further occa&s;ion of publi&s;hing her triumph and exultation in her hu&s;band's fall, by paying the &s;ame funeral honours to Pau&s;anias, that were paid to Philip: both bodies were burned on the &s;ame pile, and the a&s;hes of both depo&s;ited in the &s;ame tomb. She is even &s;aid to have prevailed on the Macedonians to pay annual honours to Pau&s;anias; as if &s;he feared, that the &s;hare, which he had in the death of Philip, &s;hould not be known to the whole world. She con&s;ecrated to Apollo the dagger which had been the in&s;tru|ment of the fatal deed, in&s;cribed with the name of Myrtalis, the name which &s;he bore when their loves fir&s;t began.</P>
<P>Thus died Philip, a prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great abi|lities both in peace and war, but much fonder of gaining his ends by dexterity and addre&s;s than by
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="212" REF="218">
of arms. The news of his death was a joyful &s;ur|pri&s;e in Greece, and particularly at Athens, where the people crowned them&s;elves with garlands, and decreed a crown to Pau&s;anias. They &s;acrificed to the gods for their deliverance, and &s;ung &s;ongs of triumph, as if Philip had been &s;lain by them in battle. But this exce&s;s of joy very ill became them, becau&s;e it was altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with their late behaviour to that prince; for when he was cho&s;en generali&s;&s;imo of the Greeks, and &s;till more when he celebrated the nuptials of his daughter, the Athe|nians were the mo&s;t forward and the mo&s;t ful&s;ome in their compliments to him, and carried their adu|lation &s;o far, as almo&s;t to exalt him to the rank of a God.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. FROM THE BIRTH OF ALEXANDER TO HIS SET|TING OUT FOR ASIA.</HEAD>
<P>ALEXANDER, the &s;on of Philip, a&s;cended the throne upon the death of his father, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a kingdom rendered flouri&s;hing and powerful by the policy of the preceding reign.</P>
<P>He came into the world the very day the cele|brated temple of Diana at Ephe&s;us was burnt, which gave occa&s;ion to Hege&s;ias the hi&s;torian to &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"that it was no wonder the temple was burnt, as Diana was that day employed at the delivery of Olympias, to facilitate the birth of Alexander."</Q></P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion, by which Alexander was mo&s;t pow|erfully actuated, even in his tender years, was ambi|tion, and a love of glory, but not of every kind of glory. Philip, like a &s;ophi&s;t, valued him&s;elf upon his eloquence, and the beauty of his &s;tyle; and had the vanity to have engraved, on his coins, the
<PB N="213" REF="219">
&s;everal victories he had won in the chariot-race at the Olympic games. But it was not after &s;uch empty honours that his &s;on a&s;pired. When his friends one day a&s;ked him, whether he would con|tend at the&s;e games, <Q REND="inline">"Yes, &s;aid he, I readily will, provided I may have kings to contend with me."</Q></P>
<P>Every time news was brought him that his father had taken &s;ome city, or gained &s;ome great battle, Alexander, &s;o far from &s;haring in the general joy, u&s;ed to &s;ay, in a plaintive tone of voice, to the young per&s;ons that were brought up with him, <Q REND="inline">"Friends, my father will po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of every thing, and leave nothing for me to do."</Q></P>
<P>Some amba&s;&s;adors from the king of Per&s;ia having one day arrived at court in his father's ab&s;ence, and Alexander being obliged to entertain them, he not only charmed them with the politene&s;s of his beha|viour, but he filled them with a&s;toni&s;hment at his common good &s;en&s;e and the &s;agacity of his remarks. For, in&s;tead of a&s;king them que&s;tions about &s;uch trifling circum&s;tances as are commonly the objects of curio&s;ity to people of his years; &s;uch as the &s;o much boa&s;ted gardens &s;u&s;pended in the air; the riches and magnificence of the palace and court of the king of Per&s;ia, which excited the admiration of the whole world; the famous golden plantain-tree; and that golden vine, the grapes of which were emeralds, carbuncles, rubies, and all &s;orts of precious &s;tones, under which the Per&s;ian monarch was &s;aid frequently to give audience&mdash;in&s;tead, I &s;ay, of a&s;king &s;uch frivolous que&s;tions as the&s;e, Alex|ander enquired which was the road to Upper A&s;ia; what was the di&s;tance of the &s;everal places; in what the real &s;trength of the king of Per&s;ia con|&s;i&s;ted; in what part of the battle he fought; how he behaved towards his enemies; and in what man|ner he governed his &s;ubjects. The amba&s;&s;adors, &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him di&s;cover a &s;agacity &s;o greatly be|yond
<PB N="214" REF="220">
his years, could not help exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"This young prince is great, and ours is rich; that man mu&s;t be extremely in&s;ignificant, who has no other merit than his riches."</Q></P>
<P>So ripe a judgment in this young prince, was as much owing to the good education which had been given him, as to the &s;trength of his natural parts. Several preceptors, as we have already ob&s;erved, were employed to teach him mu&s;ic and other &s;u|perficial accompli&s;hments; but the tutor, from whom he received all his real and u&s;eful knowledge, was Ari&s;totle, the mo&s;t famous and mo&s;t learned philo&s;opher of the age: it was he that was en|tru&s;ted with the chief care of Alexander's educa|tion. One of the rea&s;ons which prompted Philip to give him a ma&s;ter of &s;o much eminence and merit, was, as he him&s;elf tells us, that his &s;on might avoid committing a great many faults, of which he him&s;elf had been guilty.</P>
<P>Philip was &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of Ari&s;totle's merit, and he rewarded it with the liberality and munifi|cence of a prince. He not only &s;ettled a genteel &s;alary upon him, but he afterwards expre&s;&s;ed his re|gard for him in a more public and con&s;picuous manner; for having formerly &s;tormed and &s;acked Stagira, the native city of Ari&s;totle, he now re|built it, and rein&s;tated the inhabitants who had fled from it, or were made &s;laves; giving them be&s;ides, a fine park in the neighbourhood as a place for their &s;tudies and exerci&s;es. Plutarch tells us, that, even in his time, the people of Stagira &s;hewed the &s;tone-&s;eats of Ari&s;totle, as al&s;o the &s;hady walks which he u&s;ed to frequent.</P>
<P>Alexander likewi&s;e di&s;covered no le&s;s e&s;teem for his ma&s;ter, whom he believed him&s;elf bound to love as much as if he had been his father; declaring, that he was indebted to the one for living, and to the other for living well. The progre&s;s of the
<PB N="215" REF="221">
pupil was equal to the care and abilities of the pre|ceptor. He grew extremely fond of philo&s;ophy, and learned the &s;everal parts of it. But his favourite &s;tudy was morality, which is properly the &s;cience of kings, becau&s;e it is the knowledge of mankind, and of their duties. To this he applied him&s;elf with unwearied attention, and con&s;idered it even at that time as the foundation of prudence and wi&s;e policy.</P>
<P>Nor was Ari&s;totle le&s;s careful to in&s;truct him in the art of &s;peaking, than in that of thinking and rea&s;oning; and for this purpo&s;e he wrote his cele|brated treati&s;e on rhetoric, in the beginning of which he proves the va&s;t advantages a prince may derive from eloquence, as it gives him the greate&s;t a&s;cendant over the minds of men, which he ought to acquire, as well by his wi&s;dom as authority. Some an&s;wers and letters of Alexander, which are &s;till extant, &s;hew that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in its greate&s;t perfection, that &s;trong, that manly eloquence, which abounds with &s;en&s;e and ideas, and which is &s;o entirely free from &s;uperfluous expre&s;&s;ions, that every &s;ingle word has its meaning, which, properly &s;peak|ing, is the eloquence of kings.</P>
<P>His e&s;teem, or rather his veneration for Homer is well known. When a golden box, enriched with precious &s;tones, was found in the Per&s;ian camp after the battle of Arbela, and it was deliberated to what purpo&s;e it &s;hould be applied, Alexander &s;aid, that there was nothing &s;o worthy of being put into it as Homer's Poems, which he believed to be the mo&s;t per|fect, and mo&s;t complete production of the human mind. He admired particularly the Iliad, which he con&s;ider|ed as a trea&s;ure of military knowledge. He always had with him that copy of it which had been revi&s;ed and corrected by Ari&s;totle, and to which he gave the name of the ca&s;ket-copy; and he laid it with his &s;word every night under his pillow.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="222">Fond, even to exce&s;s, of every kind of glory, he was di&s;plea&s;ed with Ari&s;totle, his ma&s;ter, for having publi&s;hed, in his ab&s;ence, certain metaphy&s;ical pieces which he him&s;elf de&s;ired to po&s;&s;e&s;s exclu&s;ively of all others; and even at the time when he was em|ployed in the conque&s;t of A&s;ia, and the pur&s;uit of Darius, he wrote him a letter, which is &s;till extant, wherein he complains upon that very account. Alexander &s;ays in it, that he had much rather &s;urpa&s;s others in the knowledge of the &s;ublimer &s;ciences, than in the greatne&s;s of his power or the extent of his dominion.</P>
<P>He had al&s;o a ta&s;te for the whole circle of the arts, but in &s;uch a manner as became a prince; that is, he knew the value and utility of them. Mu&s;ic, painting, &s;culpture, architecture, flouri&s;hed in his reign; becau&s;e they found him both a judge and a generous protector; who was able to di&s;tingui&s;h and to reward merit. But he de&s;pi&s;ed certain trifling feats of dexterity, that were of no u&s;e. One day &s;ome Macedonians expre&s;&s;ing their &s;urpri&s;e at the in|genuity of a man, that excelled in throwing &s;mall peas through the eye of a needle, Alexander &s;aid, that he would make him a pre&s;ent &s;uitable to his employment, and he accordingly &s;ent him a ba&s;ket of peas.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t in&s;tance Alexander gave of his bold and daring &s;pirit, was in his management of the fa|mous hor&s;e Bucephalus, which had been brought to his father's court by Philonicus, the The&s;&s;alian, who refu&s;ed to &s;ell him for le&s;s than thirteen talents. The king went into the plains, attended by his courtiers, in order to make a trial of this hor&s;e; but they found him &s;o very wild and unmanageable, that no one would venture to mount him. Philip being angry that &s;o furious and ungovernable a crea|ture had been brought to him, gave orders for their carrying him back again. Alexander, who was
<PB N="217" REF="223">
pre&s;ent at this time, cried out, <Q REND="inline">"What a noble hor&s;e we are going to lo&s;e, for want of addre&s;s and boldne&s;s to back him!"</Q> Philip at fir&s;t con&s;idered the&s;e words as the effect of folly and ra&s;hne&s;s, &s;o common to young men; but as Alexander &s;till in|&s;i&s;ted upon what he had &s;aid, and was very unea&s;y to &s;ee &s;o noble a creature ju&s;t going to be &s;ent home again, his father at la&s;t gave him leave to try what he could do. The young prince, overjoyed at this permi&s;&s;ion, goes up to Bucephalus, takes hold of the bridle, and turns his head to the &s;un, having ob&s;erved that the thing which frightened him was his own &s;hadow. Alexander, therefore, fir&s;t &s;troked him gently with his hand, and &s;oothed him with his voice; then &s;eeing his fiercene&s;s abate, he &s;oftly let fall his cloak, and &s;pringing upon his back at one leap, he fir&s;t &s;lightly tightened the rein, without &s;triking or vexing him; and when he perceived that his fire was cooled, that he was no longer &s;o furi|ous and violent, and that he wanted only to move forward, he gave him the rein, and &s;purring him with great vigour, animated him with his voice to his full &s;peed. While this was doing, Philip and his whole court trembled for fear, and did not once open their lips: but when the prince, after hav|ing run his fir&s;t heat, returned with pride and triumph, at having thus broke a hor&s;e that was deemed ab&s;olutely ungovernable, the courtiers in general bur&s;t out into acclamations of applau&s;e, while Philip, with tears of joy in his eyes, em|braced Alexander, as he alighted, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, &s;eek a kingdom more worthy of thee, for Ma|cedon is below thy merit."</Q></P>
<P>Alexander, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded with danger on every &s;ide; not only from the barbarous nations, with whom Philip had contended during his whole reign, and who were impatient of the yoke he had impo&s;ed upon
<PB N="218" REF="224">
them; but likewi&s;e from the Greeks them&s;elves, who re&s;olved to lay hold of this opportunity to reco|ver their liberties, of which Philip had deprived them in reality, though not in appearance. The danger, indeed, from both the&s;e quarters was &s;o great and &s;o imminent, that the more prudent among the Ma|cedonians advi&s;ed their &s;overeign to ward them off by policy and addre&s;s, rather than repel them by force of arms. But the&s;e timorous coun&s;els were by no means agreeable to the bold and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit of Alexander. He plainly &s;aw, that if his enemies perceived him betraying the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of fear, they would be all upon him at once, would &s;trip him of his father's conque&s;ts, and reduce his dominions to the narrow limits of Macedon.</P>
<P>He therefore marched fir&s;t again&s;t the Barbarians; and cro&s;&s;ing the Danube in one night, he defeated the king of the Triballi in a great battle, and &s;truck &s;uch terror into the neighbouring nations, as obliged them for the pre&s;ent to remain quiet. Returning thence, in a little time, he turned his arms again&s;t the Greeks, and particularly the Thebans, who upon a fal&s;e report of his death, had cut to pieces a great number of the Macedonian garri&s;on in thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> citadel.

willing to allow them time to repent; and only de|manded to have Phoenix and Prothules, the two chief ringleaders of the revolt, delivered up to him; and publi&s;hed, by &s;ound of trumpet, a general pardon to all who &s;hould come over to him. But the Thebans, by way of in&s;ult, demanded to have Philotas and Antipater delivered to them, and in|vited, by proclamation, all who were &s;olicitous for the liberty of Greece to join them in its defence.</P>
<P>Alexander, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to prevail upon them by gentle means, was obliged to employ more powerful arguments, and to decide the matter by force of arms. A great battle was accordingly fought, in which the Thebans behaved with a &s;pirit and intrepidity much beyond their &s;trength, for the enemy exceeded them va&s;tly in numbers. But after a long and ob&s;tinate di&s;pute, the Macedonian garri&s;on coming down from the citadel, and attacking them in the rear, the Thebans were &s;urrounded on all &s;ides, the greate&s;t part of them were cut in pieces, and the city was taken and plundered.</P>
<P>The calamities which they &s;uffered on this oc|ca&s;ion, may be more ea&s;ily conceived than expre&s;&s;ed. Some Thracians having pulled down the hou&s;e of a virtuous lady of quality, Timoclea by name, car|ried off all her goods and trea&s;ures; and their cap|tain naming forcibly violated her cha&s;tity, enquired of her afterwards whether &s;he had not concealed gold and &s;ilver. Timoclea, animated by an ardent de&s;ire of revenge, &s;aid that &s;he had hid &s;ome, and taking him with her alone into the garden, and &s;hewing him a well, told him, that there lay her concealed trea&s;ure. The Barbarian &s;tooping down to look into the well, Timoclea, who was behind him, pu&s;hed him forward with all her might, threw him in, and afterwards killed him with great &s;tones, which &s;he heaped upon him. She was in&s;tantly &s;eized by the Thracians, and being put in chains
<PB N="220" REF="226">
was carried before Alexander. The prince imme|diately perceived by her mien, that &s;he was a woman of quality and of a lofty &s;pirit; for &s;he followed tho&s;e brutal wretches with an undaunted air, and without di&s;covering the lea&s;t &s;ign of fear. Alex|ander a&s;king her who &s;he was, Timoclea replied, <Q REND="inline">"I am &s;i&s;ter to Theagenes, who fought again&s;t Philip for the liberty of Greece, and was killed in the battle of Chaeronea, where he commanded."</Q> The prince, admiring her magnanimous an&s;wer, and the puni&s;hment &s;he had inflicted on her cruel ravi&s;her, gave orders that &s;he &s;hould have leave to retire wherever &s;he plea&s;ed with her children.</P>
<P>Alexander con&s;idered for &s;ome time with him&s;elf how he &s;hould act with regard to Thebes. His own re&s;entment carried him to the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures; and this was &s;till farther inflamed by the repre&s;enta|tions of the Phocians, and the people of Plataea, The&s;piae, and Orchomenus, who were all of them mortal enemies to the Thebans. Tran&s;ported therefore by his own furious pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;till further in&s;tigated by their cruel advice, he unhappily adopted the mo&s;t &s;evere re&s;olution, and the city was in|&s;tantly razed to the ground. But he did not wreak his vengeance upon all the inhabitants indi&s;crimi|nately. He &s;et the prie&s;ts at liberty; as al&s;o all &s;uch as had a right of ho&s;pitality with the Macedonians; the de&s;cendants of Pindar, the famous poet, who had done &s;o much honour to Greece; and &s;uch likewi&s;e as bad oppo&s;ed the revolt. But all the re&s;t, in number about thirty thou&s;and he &s;old; and up|wards of &s;ix thou&s;and had been killed in battle. The Athenians were &s;o deeply affected on hearing of the &s;ad cata&s;trophe of Thebes, that they put off the celebration of the Great My&s;teries, which they were about to &s;olemnize; and they received, with the greate&s;t humanity, all tho&s;e who had e&s;caped
<PB N="221" REF="227">
from the battle, and the &s;acking of Thebes, and made Athens their a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>The Athenians had not only encouraged the Thebans to &s;et Alexander at defiance; they had even formed a league with them and the Lacedae|monians to check the progre&s;s of his arms: but his &s;udden arrival in Greece, and the example he had now given, of the dreadful con&s;equences of incurring his di&s;plea&s;ure, made them begin to abate con&s;iderably of their wonted pride, and, in&s;tead of pre&s;uming to oppo&s;e his power, they judged it, for the pre&s;ent, the mo&s;t eligible cour&s;e to implore his clemency. They therefore &s;ent a deputation to him, in which Demo&s;thenes was included; but he had no &s;ooner arrived at mount Cytheron, than, dreading the anger of the Macedonian prince, he quitted the emba&s;&s;y, and returned home.</P>
<P>Alexander well knew, that it was the orators chiefly that kept alive the love of liberty and the &s;pirit of independence among the people of Athens, and con&s;equently formed the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to the completion of his de&s;igns. He therefore now de|manded, that ten of the&s;e orators &s;hould be put in|to his hands. It was on this occa&s;ion that De|mo&s;thenes related to the people the fable of the wolves and the dogs; in which it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the wolves one day told the &s;heep, that in ca&s;e they de&s;ired to be at peace with them, they mu&s;t deliver up to them the dogs who were their guard. The application was ea&s;y and natural; e&s;pecially with re|&s;pect to the orators, who were ju&s;tly compared to dogs, who&s;e duty it is to watch, to bark, and to fight, in order to &s;ave the lives of the flock.</P>
<P>In this afflicting dilemma of the Athenians, who could not think of delivering up their orators to what they con&s;idered as certain death, though they had no other way to &s;ave their city, Demades, whom Alexander had honoured with his friend&s;hip,
<PB N="222" REF="228">
offered to undertake the emba&s;&s;y alone, and intercede for them. He did &s;o, and &s;ucceeded; whether it was, that the king had already &s;atiated his revenge, and that he was willing, by &s;ome act of clemency, to wipe out the remembrance of the cruelties he had lately committed, or perhaps was de&s;irous of conciliating the affections of the Greeks in general, before he &s;et out on his A&s;iatic expedition. Cer|tain it is, that he waved his demand with regard to the delivery of the Athenian orators, and was pa|cified by their &s;ending into bani&s;hment Caridemus, who, being a native of Oraea, had been pre&s;ented by the Athenians with the freedom of the city.</P>
<P>As for the Athenians them&s;elves, he not only for|gave them the &s;everal injuries he pretended to have received from them, but he even flattered their pride, by advi&s;ing them to give particular attention to public affairs, becau&s;e, in ca&s;e of his death, he &s;aid, they were likely to give law to the re&s;t of Greece. Hi&s;torians relate, that, many years after this expedition, he was &s;eized with remor&s;e for the cruel puni&s;hment he had inflicted on the Thebans, and that this &s;oftened his temper, and made him be|have with greater humanity towards other nations.</P>
<P>Being now freed from all apprehen&s;ions of any further oppo&s;ition from Greece, he &s;ummoned at Corinth an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;everal &s;tates and free cities of that country, in order to obtain from them the &s;upreme command again&s;t the Per&s;ians, which had been granted to his father a little before his death. No a&s;&s;embly ever deliberated upon a more important &s;ubject. It was the we&s;tern world de|ciding upon the fate of the ea&s;t; and concerting methods for executing a revenge, which had been &s;u&s;pended for more than an age. The a&s;&s;embly held at this time gave ri&s;e to events, the relation of which appears a&s;toni&s;hing and almo&s;t incredible; and to
<PB N="223" REF="229">
revolutions, which contributed to change the di&s;|po&s;ition of mo&s;t things in the political world.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h &s;uch a &s;cheme required a prince of Alexander's bold and enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit, and a people like the Greeks, brave, hardy, and active, animated by a love of military glory, and in&s;pired with an implacable re&s;entment again&s;t the nation they were going to attack. The Greeks, indeed, had long wi&s;hed for an opportunity to revenge upon Per&s;ia the injuries they had &s;u&s;tained from that em|pire; and they now therefore accepted with plea&s;ure the offer of Alexander to lead them again&s;t their old and irreconcileable enemies, who&s;e de&s;truction they had repeatedly &s;worn, and whom they hoped in a little time to be able to extirpate. The Lacedaemonians were the only people that made any objections to this propo&s;al. They &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"they had always been accu&s;tomed to point out the way to glorious deeds, and not to be directed by others."</Q> But they were obliged to &s;ubmit to the prevailing &s;en&s;e of the a&s;|&s;embly; and Alexander was, of cour&s;e, appointed generali&s;&s;imo again&s;t the Per&s;ians.</P>
<P>He was no &s;ooner rai&s;ed to this high rank, than he received congratulations from the philo&s;ophers, the governors of cities, and other great men; and he expected the &s;ame compliment from Diogenes of Sy|nope, who was then at Corinth. But as Diogenes did not think proper to come to him, he went attended by his whole court, to vi&s;it that philo&s;opher. He found him lying on the ground, and ba&s;king him|&s;elf in the &s;un; and being &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a man of &s;o much reputation living in &s;uch extreme poverty, he naturally a&s;ked him whether he wanted any thing? <Q REND="inline">"Only, &s;aid Diogenes, that you would &s;tand from between me and the &s;un."</Q> This an&s;wer excited the contempt of all the courtiers; but the king was &s;o &s;truck with the philo&s;opher's greatne&s;s
<PB N="224" REF="230">
of &s;oul, that he could not help exclaiming, <Q REND="inline">"Were I not Alexander, I would be Diogenes."</Q></P>
<P>Before he &s;et out for A&s;ia, he re&s;olved to con&s;ult the oracle of Apollo. He therefore went to Delphos, where he happened to arrive in tho&s;e days which are called unlucky, that is, at a time when it was un|lawful to give re&s;pon&s;es; and accordingly the prie&s;te&s;s refu&s;ed to go to the temple. But Alexander, who could not bear any contradiction to his will, took her forcibly by the arm, and as he was leading her to the temple, &s;he cried out, <Q REND="inline">"My &s;on, thou art invincible."</Q> Alexander, catching hold of the&s;e words as the an&s;wer of the oracle, declared that it was needle&s;s to con&s;ult the God any further, and he therefore returned to Macedon, in order to prepare for his great expedition.</P>
<P>Some of his friends advi&s;ed him, before he em|barked in this undertaking, to make choice of a con&s;ort, in order to &s;ecure him&s;elf a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his throne. But the king, who was of an impetuous temper, di&s;approved of this advice, and &s;aid, that after he had been nominated generali&s;&s;imo of the Greeks, and that his father had left him &s;o gallant an army, it would be a &s;hame for him to lo&s;e time in celebrating his marriage, and waiting for the fruits of it; and that therefore he was determined to &s;et out immediately.</P>
<P>Before he did &s;o, however, he thought proper to &s;ettle the affairs of Macedon. He appointed An|tipater to be viceroy of that kingdom, with an army of twelve thou&s;and &s;hot, and near the &s;ame num|ber of hor&s;e. He then enquired into the private circum&s;tances of his friends, giving to one an e&s;tate in land, to another a village, to a third the revenues of a town, and to a fourth the toll of an harbour. As all the revenues of his crown were already employed, or exhau&s;ted by his donations, Perdiccas &s;aid to him, <Q REND="inline">"My Lord, what is it you
<PB N="225" REF="231">
re&s;erve for your&s;elf?"</Q> Alexander replied, <Q REND="inline">Hope:</Q> upon which Perdiccas &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"the &s;ame hope ought therefore to &s;atisfy us;"</Q> and &s;o refu&s;ed very gene|rou&s;ly to accept of what the king had allotted him.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. FROM ALEXANDER'S ARRIVAL IN ASIA TO HIS DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>ALEXANDER, having taken the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for &s;ecuring the tranquillity of Ma|cedon in his ab&s;ence, &s;et out for A&s;ia in the begin|ning of the &s;pring. His army con&s;i&s;ted of little more than thirty thou&s;and foot, and four or five thou&s;and hor&s;e; but then they were all brave men, well di&s;ciplined, and enured to fatigue. They had made &s;everal campaigns under Philip, and were each of them, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, capable of com|manding: mo&s;t of the officers were near three&s;core years of age, and the common men fifty; and when they were either a&s;&s;embled, or drawn up at the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d of a camp, they had the appearance of a ve|nerable &s;enate. Parmenio commanded the infantry; P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lotas, his &s;on, had eighteen hundred hor&s;e under him; and Callas, the &s;on of Harpalus, the &s;ame na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ger of The&s;&s;alian cavalry. The re&s;t of the hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of natives of the &s;everal &s;tates, were under the direction of a &s;eparate commander. And the Thracians and Poeonians, who were always in front, were headed by Ca&s;&s;andra. Such was the army, which was to decide the fortune, not only of Greece, but of all the ea&s;tern world. Alexander be|gan his march along the lake Cercinum; and after pa&s;&s;ing the rivers Strymon and Hebrus, he came to the &s;hore of the Helle&s;pont, which he cro&s;&s;ed in an hundred and &s;ixty gallies, and &s;everal flat-bottomed
<PB N="226" REF="232">
ve&s;&s;els, him&s;elf &s;teering his own galley; and upon his arrival at the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, as if to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the continent, he leaped from his &s;hip in complete armour, and expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t tran|&s;ports of joy.</P>
<P>It has frequently been thought &s;trange, that the Per&s;ians took no &s;tep to check the progre&s;s of the Macedonians at the Helle&s;pont, where they might certainly have been oppo&s;ed with the greate&s;t ea&s;e; e&s;pecially as the former were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large and powerful fleet, and that of the latter was very incon&s;iderable. Whether this proceeded from &s;upinene&s;s and inattention, or from a contempt of the enemy, it is difficult to determine. What|ever was the cau&s;e, the event proved equally fatal to the Per&s;ians.</P>
<P>Alexander being arrived at Lamp&s;acus, was going to de&s;troy it, in order to puni&s;h the rebellion of the inhabitants; and Anaximenes therefore, a native of the place, came to him with a view of diverting him from his cruel re&s;olution. This man, who was a famous hi&s;torian, had been very intimate with Philip his father; and Alexander him&s;elf had a great e&s;teem for him, having been his pupil. The king, &s;u&s;pecting the purport of his errand, and will|ing to be beforehand with him, &s;wore, that he would never grant his reque&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"The favour I have to de&s;ire of you, &s;ays Anaximenes, is that you would de&s;troy Lamp&s;acus."</Q> By this witty eva&s;ion the hi&s;torian &s;aved his country.</P>
<P>From thence Alexander went to Troy, where he paid great honours to the memory of the heroes who had fallen there, and particularly to that of Achilles, at who&s;e tomb he cau&s;ed funeral games to be performed. He declared that he looked upon Achilles as one of the happie&s;t of men, in having had, during his life, &s;o faithful a friend as a Patro|clus,
<PB N="227" REF="233">
and, after his death, &s;o famous a poet as Homer to celebrate his actions.</P>
<P>When Darius was informed of Alexander's ar|rival in A&s;ia, he expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t contempt for the Macedonian army, and indignation at the pre|&s;umption of their general. He wrote letters to the governors of his different provinces, com|manding them, if they took Alexander alive, to whip him with rods, to make pri&s;oners of his whole army, and to &s;end them as &s;laves to one of the re|mote&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;ert parts of his dominions. It was not long, however, before he had rea&s;on to entertain more ju&s;t and more mode&s;t &s;entiments. Alexander being arrived on the banks of the Gra|nicus, a river of Phrygia, found the Per&s;ians to the number of a hundred and ten thou&s;and men, drawn up on the other &s;ide, and ready to di&s;pute his pa&s;|&s;age. Memnon, who command all the &s;ea-coa&s;t of A&s;ia under Darius, gave it as his opinion, that the wi&s;e&s;t cour&s;e would be to lay wa&s;te the adjacent country, and thus to oblige the Macedonian army either to retreat, or to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion for want of provi&s;ions. But this prudent advice was over-ruled by Ar&s;ites, a Phrygian Satrap, who &s;aid, that he would never &s;uffer the Grecians to make &s;uch havock in the territories he governed.</P>
<P>Nor was Alexander, on his &s;ide, without tho&s;e who advi&s;ed him to proceed with caution, and to refrain from cro&s;&s;ing the river the &s;ame day on which he reached it. This, in particular, was the opi|nion of Parmenio, a brave and experienced officer, who ob&s;erved, that the troops were already too much fatigued with their march, to be equal to the additional labour of cro&s;&s;ing a river, e&s;pecially one which was &s;o deep, and who&s;e banks were &s;o craggy, and that too in the face of &s;uch an immen&s;e body of the enemy, who were perfectly fre&s;h, and were ready to oppo&s;e him. But the&s;e arguments made no im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="228" REF="234">
on Alexander, who declared, that it would be a &s;hame for him, after cro&s;&s;ing the Helle&s;pont, to &s;uffer his progre&s;s to be interrupted by a rivulet, for &s;o he called the Granicus by way of contempt: that, on the contrary, they ought to take advantage of the terror which the &s;uddenne&s;s of his arrival, and the boldne&s;s of his attempt, had &s;pread among the Per&s;ians, and an&s;wer the high opinion the world had conceived of his courage, and the valour of the Macedonians.</P>
<P>The two armies, however, continued for &s;ome time on the oppo&s;ite banks of the river, the one looking out for a proper place to ford it, and the other narrowly watching their motions, and deter|mined, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent their pa&s;&s;age. At la&s;t Alexander ordered his hor&s;e to be brought; and commanding the nobleman of his court to follow him, and behave gallantly, he cau&s;ed a &s;trong de|tachment to march into the river, him&s;elf following it with the right wing of his army, as Parmenio did with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t. The Per&s;ians, &s;eeing the detachment advance, began to let fly their arrows, and march to a place where the bank was not &s;o &s;teep, in order to keep the Macedonians from landing. But now the hor&s;e engaged with great fury, one part endea|vouring to land, and the other &s;triving to prevent them. The Macedonians, who&s;e cavalry were va&s;tly inferior in number, be&s;ides the di&s;advantage of the ground, were overwhelmed with the &s;howers of darts that were poured from the eminence; not to mention that the flower of the Per&s;ian hor&s;e were drawn together here, and were headed by Memnon, the able&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;olute of all the Per&s;ian ge|nerals. The Macedonians, therefore, at la&s;t gave way, after having performed many &s;ignal acts of valour. But Alexander coming up, re&s;tored the battle; he reinforced them with his be&s;t troops; he headed them him&s;elf; he animated them by his pre|&s;ence;
<PB N="229" REF="235">
he pu&s;hed the Per&s;ians, and at la&s;t routed them; upon which the whole army followed after, cro&s;&s;ed the river, and attacked the enemy on all &s;ides.</P>
<P>Alexander fir&s;t charged the thicke&s;t part of the enemy's hor&s;e, in which the generals fought. He him&s;elf was particularly con&s;picuous by his &s;hield, and the plume of feathers that over&s;hadowed his helmet, &s;o that he was ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of the army. The charge, therefore, was very furious about his per&s;on; and though only the hor&s;e engaged, they fought like foot, man to man, with|out giving way on either &s;ide. Spithridates, lieu|tenant-governor of Ionia, and &s;on-in-law to Darius, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf above the re&s;t of the generals by his &s;uperior bravery. Surrounded by forty Per|&s;ian lords, all of them his relations, of experienced valour, and who never moved from his &s;ide, he carried terror wherever he came. Alexander ob|&s;erving in how gallant a manner he &s;ignalized him|&s;elf, clapt &s;purs to his hor&s;e and advanced towards him. Immediately they engaged, and each having thrown a javelin, wounded the other &s;lightly. Spithridates falls furiou&s;ly &s;word in hand upon Alex|ander, who, being prepared for him, thru&s;ts his p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke into his face, and laid him dead at his feet. At that very moment Rhae&s;aces, brother to that nobleman, charging him on the &s;ide, gave him a furious blow on the head with his battle-axe, which beat off his plume, but went no deeper than his hair. As he was going to repeat the blow on his head, which now appeared through the broken hel|met, Clytus cut off Rhae&s;aces's hand with one &s;troke of his &s;cimitar, and by that means &s;aved his &s;ove|reign's life. The danger, to which Alexander had expo&s;ed him&s;elf, added fre&s;h courage to his &s;oldiers, who now performed prodigies of valour. The Per&s;ians, therefore, unable any longer to &s;u&s;tain the a&s;&s;ault of
<PB N="230" REF="236">
the Macedonians, immediately gave way, and were put to a total rout. Alexander did not pur&s;ue them far, but wheeling about &s;uddenly, began in an in&s;tant to make an attack upon the foot.</P>
<P>The conte&s;t here was neither long nor violent; for the enemy &s;eeing the Macedonian phalanx, which had now cro&s;&s;ed the river, and was regu|larly formed, advancing again&s;t them, they imme|diately took to flight, all but the Grecian infantry in Darius's pay. This body of foot, retiring to a hill, demanded permi&s;&s;ion to march away unmole&s;ted; but Alexander, guided by pa&s;&s;ion rather than rea&s;on, ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly into the mid&s;t of them, and had his hor&s;e killed under him by the thru&s;t of a &s;word. The battle here for &s;ome time was &s;o hot, that more of the Macedonians tell in this encounter than in all the preceding action; for they fought again&s;t a body of men, who were well di&s;ciplined, had been enured to war, and were actuated by de&s;pair. They were all cut to pieces, two thou&s;and excepted, who were taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>A great number of the Per&s;ian commanders lay dead on the &s;pot. Ar&s;ites fled into Phrygia, where he is &s;aid to have laid violent hands on him&s;elf, for having advi&s;ed his countrymen to come to an imme|diate engagement. In this action twenty thou&s;and foot, and two thou&s;and five hundred hor&s;e were killed on the &s;ide of the barbarians; and of the Macedonians twenty-five of the royal hor&s;e were killed in the fir&s;t attack. Alexander ordered Ly&s;ip|pus to make their &s;tatues of bra&s;s, all of which were &s;et up in a city of Macedon, called Dia, from whence they were many years after carried to Rome by Metelius. About three&s;core of the other hor&s;e were killed, and near thirty foot, who, the next day, were all laid with their arms and equipage in one grave; and the king granted an exemption to their
<PB N="231" REF="237">
fathers and children from every kind of tribute and &s;ervice.</P>
<P>He al&s;o took the utmo&s;t care of the wounded, vi&s;ited them, and &s;aw their wounds dre&s;&s;ed. He enquired very particularly into their adventures, and permitted every one of them to relate his actions in the battle, and boa&s;t of his bravery. He al&s;o granted the rites of &s;epulture to the principal Per&s;ians, and did not even refu&s;e it to &s;uch Greeks as died in the Per&s;ian &s;ervice; but all tho&s;e whom he took pri|&s;oners, he put in chains, and &s;ent to work as &s;laves in Macedonia, for having fought under the barba|rian &s;tandard again&s;t their country, contrary to the expre&s;s prohibition made by Greece on that head.</P>
<P>Alexander thought it his duty, and made it his plea&s;ure, to &s;hare the honour of his victory with the Greeks. He &s;ent to the Athenians three hundred &s;hields, being part of the plunder taken from the enemy, and cau&s;ed this glorious in&s;cription to be put upon the re&s;t of the &s;poils: <Q REND="inline">"Alexander, &s;on of Philip, with the Greeks (the Lacedaemonians excepted) gained the&s;e &s;poils from the barbarians, who inhabit A&s;ia."</Q> The greate&s;t part of the gold and &s;ilver plate, the purple carpets, and other ar|ticles of Per&s;ian luxury, he &s;ent to his mother.</P>
<P>The terrible defeat, which the Per&s;ians had now &s;u&s;tained, &s;truck &s;uch a terror into their minds, that they could not be brought, for a long time, to oppo&s;e Alexander in the field; and he therefore proceeded, without interruption, to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of one town after another; &s;ome, indeed, with more, and others with le&s;s difficulty. Sardis and Ephe&s;us he ea&s;ily reduced. The inhabitants of the former he took under his protection, and per|mitted them to be governed by their own laws; ob&s;erving to his friends, at the &s;ame time, that &s;uch as lay the foundation of a new empire &s;hould al|ways endeavour to have the fame of being merci|ful.
<PB N="232" REF="238">
At Ephe&s;us he a&s;&s;igned to the temple of Diana, the tributes which had been paid to the Per&s;ian kings.</P>
<P>He next laid &s;iege to Miletus, and afterwards to Halicarna&s;&s;us, both of which he compelled to &s;ur|render, though not till after a &s;harp and ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, as both of them were defended by Mem|non, the brave&s;t and mo&s;t experienced of all Da|rius's generals. The Mile&s;ians he treated with great humanity, but Halicarna&s;&s;us he thought proper to raze to the ground. Soon after this, he re&s;tored Ada, queen of Caria, to her kingdom, of which &s;he had been lately di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and &s;he, in order to te&s;tify her gratitude, &s;ent him meats dre&s;&s;ed in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite manner, and the mo&s;t excellent cooks of every kind. Alexander thanked her for her po|litene&s;s, but at the &s;ame time told her, that he had much better cooks of his own, whom his governor Leonidas had given him, one of whom prepared him a good dinner, and the other an excellent &s;upper; and the&s;e were temperance and exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Advancing &s;till further into the country, he re|ceived the voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;everal of the kings of Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, and, among others, that of Mithridates, king of Pontus, who afterwards ad|hered to him with un&s;haken fidelity, and accompa|nied him in his expedition. This man was the pre|dece&s;&s;or of the famous Mithridates, who &s;o long employed the armies of Rome, and makes &s;o capi|tal a figure in the hi&s;tory of that republic.</P>
<P>Next year Alexander re&s;olved to open the cam|paign very early. But, previous to his beginning his operations, he held a con&s;ultation with his prin|cipal officers, whether he &s;hould march directly in que&s;t of Darius, or fir&s;t &s;ubdue the other maritime provinces. The latter opinion appeared the mo&s;t prudent, as by that means he would be freed from all apprehen&s;ions of being mole&s;ted in his rear, and would leave every thing quiet and &s;ecure behind
<PB N="233" REF="239">
him. Proceeding, therefore, through a narrow de|file near the &s;ea-&s;hore, where the water was &s;o high, that his men were up to the middle in pa&s;&s;ing it, he advanced to Coelenoe, a city of Phrygia, &s;ituated on the banks of the river Mar&s;yas, which the fic|tions of the poets have rendered &s;o famous. This place he immediately inve&s;ted. The garri&s;on at fir&s;t made &s;ome &s;how of re&s;i&s;tance. But finding them|&s;elves unable to with&s;tand the vigorous and repeated a&s;&s;aults of the Grecians, they promi&s;ed to &s;urrender at the end of &s;ixty days, provided they were not re|lieved within that period; and as no aid arrived within the &s;tipulated time, the place was delivered up according to agreement.</P>
<P>From thence Alexander marched to Gordium, the &s;uppo&s;ed re&s;idence of the celebrated king Midas. Here he was de&s;irous of &s;eeing the famous chariot, to which the Gordian knot was tied. This knot, which fa&s;tened the yoke to the beam, was tied with &s;o much intri|cacy, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover where the involutions began, or where the cords terminated. According to an ancient tradition of the country, an oracle had declared, that the man who could untie it &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the empire of A&s;ia. Alex|ander being firmly per&s;uaded that the oracle was meant for him, after many fruitle&s;s trials, in&s;tead of attempting to untie it in the u&s;ual manner, drew his &s;word and cut it in pieces, crying out, that that was the only way to untie. The prie&s;t hailed the omen, and declared that Alexander had fulfilled the oracle.</P>
<P>In the mean time Darius, who now began to be &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed for the &s;afety of his empire, re|&s;olved to rai&s;e an army that might enable him to &s;top the further progre&s;s of the enemy. Alexander, however, &s;till continued to advance; and having &s;ubdued Paphlagonia and Cappadocia, he pa&s;&s;ed the &s;traits of Cilicia, where he might ea&s;ily have been
<PB N="234" REF="240">
oppo&s;ed by a handful of men; but the enemy aban|doned them as &s;oon as he approached. From thence he marched his whole army to the city of Tar&s;us, where he arrived ju&s;t in time to &s;ave it from de|&s;truction, as the Per&s;ians had &s;et fire to it, to pre|vent his becoming ma&s;ter of the trea&s;ures it con|tained. And here he gave an in&s;tance of that mag|nanimity and elevation of mind, which formed &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a part of his character. For having thrown him&s;elf into the river Cydnus, which runs through this city, in order to bathe, he was in|&s;tantly &s;eized with &s;uch a violent &s;hivering, as &s;eemed likely in a little time to put an end to his life. At fir&s;t all his phy&s;icians were afraid to admini&s;ter the nece&s;&s;ary medicines, knowing they mu&s;t be an|&s;werable for the con&s;equences that en&s;ued. But at la&s;t one of them, who&s;e name was Philip, who had always attended upon Alenxander from his youth, and loved him with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, not only as his &s;overeign but his child, rai&s;ing him&s;elf above all prudential con&s;iderations, and being more con|cerned for the life of his prince than his own &s;afety, offered to give him a do&s;e, which, though not vio|lent, would be &s;peedy in its effects, and de&s;ired three days to prepare it. At this propo&s;al every one trembled, except Alexander him&s;elf, who was af|flicted on no other account, than becau&s;e it would keep him &s;o long from appearing at the head of his army.</P>
<P>In the mean time he received a letter from Par|menio, who had been left behind in Cappadocia, advi&s;ing him to beware of Philip, his phy&s;ician; for that Darius had bribed him by the promi&s;e of a thou&s;and talents, and his &s;i&s;ter in marriage. This letter at fir&s;t gave him &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, as he could not believe that Parmenio had wrote it without having received &s;ome &s;uch intelligence. But con|fidence in a phy&s;ician, who&s;e un&s;haken fidelity and
<PB N="235" REF="241">
attachment he had experienced from his youth, at la&s;t removed all &s;u&s;picion. He therefore put the letter under his bol&s;ter without acquainting anyone with the contents; and when Philip entered with the medicine, he readily took it from him, and holding the letter in one hand and the cup in the other, he delivered the former to Philip, while he him&s;elf drank off the draught without di&s;covering the lea&s;t &s;ign of fear. This was a very &s;ingular and affecting &s;cene, Alexander looking at Philip with all the marks of the mo&s;t perfect confidence and a&s;&s;urance, while Philip in peru&s;ing the letter, &s;eemed a&s;toni&s;hed at the accu&s;ation, and called upon the gods to witne&s;s his innocence; &s;ometimes lifting up his hands to heaven, and then throwing him&s;elf down by the bed&s;ide, and be&s;eeching Alexander to lay a&s;ide all &s;u&s;picion, and rely on his fidelity. At fir&s;t the medicine worked &s;o violently, and brought Alexander &s;o low, as &s;eemed to favour Parmenio's accu&s;ation; but at length it produced the de&s;ired effect, and the king in a few days recovered his wonted vigour.</P>
<P>Meanwhile Darius was advancing again&s;t him at the head of an immen&s;e army, of which, however, he did not know how to avail him&s;elf; for, in&s;tead of remaining in the open country, where he might have extended his forces, and &s;urrounded the enemy, he fooli&s;hly marched into the narrow pa&s;&s;es, where his great &s;uperiority of numbers could be of very little &s;ervice. The rea&s;on he a&s;&s;igned for taking this precipitate &s;tep was, that he was afraid Alex|ander would e&s;cape him. But this was a needle&s;s fear. Alexander was as de&s;irous of meeting him, as he was of meeting Alexander. His courtiers, however, encouraged him in the opinion, that Alexander was endeavouring to avoid him; and that if once he could bring this invader of his em|pire to an engagement, he might depend upon ob|taining
<PB N="236" REF="242">
a complete victory. There was one man, indeed, in his army, who had the courage and the hone&s;ty to tell him the truth. This was Cari|demus, the Athenian, of whom when Darius a&s;ked whether he thought him &s;trong enough to defeat the enemy, Caridemus replied in the following terms: <Q REND="inline">"Permit me, Sir, to &s;peak truth now, when only my &s;incerity can be of &s;ervice; your pre&s;ent &s;plen|dour, your prodigious numbers which have drained the ea&s;t, may be terrible indeed to your effeminate neighbours, but can be no way dreadful to a Ma|cedonian army. Di&s;cipline, clo&s;e combat, courage, is all their care; every &s;ingle man among them is almo&s;t him&s;elf a general. The&s;e men are not to be repul&s;ed by the &s;tones of &s;lingers, or &s;takes burnt at the end; none but troops armed like them&s;elves can &s;top their career; let therefore the gold and &s;ilver, which glitters in your camp, be exchanged for &s;oldiers and &s;teel, for weapons for and hearts that are able to defend you."</Q> Darius, though naturally of a mild di&s;po&s;ition, had all his pa&s;&s;ions rouzed at the freedom of this man's advice; he ordered him at once to be executed; Caridemus all the time cry|ing out, that his avenger was at hand. Darius had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent his ra&s;hne&s;s, and experienced, when it was too late, the truth of all that had been told him.</P>
<P>That prince now advanced towards the river Euphrates, but with a parade that more re&s;embled the triumphal entry of a &s;overeign into his capital after &s;ome important victory, than the march of a warrior who was going to put every thing to hazard of the &s;word. Over his tent was exhibited the image of the &s;un in jewels, while wealth and mag|nificence &s;hone in every quarter of the army.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they carried before him &s;ilver altars, on which lay fire, called by them &s;acred and eternal; and the&s;e were followed by the Magi, &s;inging hymns
<PB N="237" REF="243">
after the manner of their country: they were accom|panied by three hundred and &s;ixty-five youths (equal|ling the number of days in a year) clothed in purple robes. Afterwards came a chariot con&s;ecrated to Ju|piter, drawn by white hor&s;es, and followed by a cour&s;er of prodigious &s;ize, to whom they gave the name of the Sun's hor&s;e; and the equerries were dre&s;&s;ed in white, each having a golden rod in his hand.</P>
<P>Ten chariots, adorned with &s;culptures in gold and &s;ilver, followed. Then marched a body of hor&s;e, compo&s;ed of twelve nations, who&s;e manners and cu&s;toms were various, and all armed in a dif|ferent manner. Next advanced tho&s;e whom the Per&s;ians called The Immortals, amounting to ten thou&s;and, who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the barbarians in the &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s of their apparel. They all wore golden collars, and were clothed in robes of gold ti&s;&s;ue, with ve&s;tments having &s;leeves to them quite covered with precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>Thirty paces from them followed tho&s;e called the king's relations, to the number of fifteen thou&s;and, in habits very much re&s;embling tho&s;e of women; and more remarkable for the vain pomp of their dre&s;s, than the glitter of their arms.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e called the Doriphori came after: they car|ried the king's cloak, and walked before his chariot, in which he &s;eemed to &s;it as on a high throne. This chariot was enriched on both &s;ides with images of the gods, in gold and &s;ilver; and from the middle of the yoke, which was covered with jewels, ro&s;e two &s;tatues, a cubit in height, the one repre|&s;enting war, the other peace, having a golden eagle, with wings extended, as ready to take flight.</P>
<P>But nothing could equal the magnificence of the king: he was clothed in a ve&s;t of purple, &s;triped with &s;ilver, and over it a long robe, glittering all over with precious &s;tones, that repre&s;ented two fal|cons, ru&s;hing from the clouds, and pecking at one
<PB N="238" REF="244">
another. Around his wai&s;t he wore a golden gir|dle, after the manner of women, whence his &s;ci|mitar hung, the &s;cabbard of which flamed all over with gems; on his head he wore a tiara, or mitre, round which was a fillet of blue mixed with white.</P>
<P>On each &s;ide of him walked two hundred of his neare&s;t relations, followed by two thou&s;and pikemen, who&s;e pikes were adorned with &s;ilver, and tipped with gold; and la&s;tly thirty thou&s;and infantry, who compo&s;ed the rear-guard. The&s;e were followed by the king's hor&s;es, four hundred in number, all which were led.</P>
<P>About one hundred, or a hundred and twenty paces from thence, came Sy&s;igambis, Darius's mo|ther, &s;eated on a throne, and his con&s;ort on ano|ther; with the &s;everal female attendants of both queens, riding on hor&s;eback. Afterwards came fifteen large chariots, in which were the king's children, and tho&s;e who had the care of their edu|cation, with a band of eunuchs, who are to this day in great e&s;teem in the ea&s;t. Then marched the concubines, to the number of three hundred and &s;ixty, in the equipage of queens, followed by &s;ix hundred mules, and three hundred camels, which carried the king's trea&s;ure, and guarded by a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> body of archers. After the&s;e came the wives of the crown-officers and of the greate&s;t lords of the court &s;eated al&s;o in chariots; and then the &s;uttlers, &s;er|vants, and other followers of the army. In the rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were a body of light-armed troops, with their com|manders, who clo&s;ed the whole march.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;plendor of this pageant monarch who, while, he excited the admiration of his own barbarous &s;ubjects, in&s;pired the Macedonians with nothing but contempt for his military &s;kill, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;trong de&s;ire to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of tho&s;e riches, of which he made &s;o vain and pompous a di&s;play.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="245">Alexander and Darius, being equally eager to come to an engagement, were now advancing again&s;t each other; and, after various marches and counter-marches, they at la&s;t met in the neighbour|hood of I&s;&s;us.</P>
<P>The &s;pot where the battle was fought, and which lay near this city, was bounded on one &s;ide by the mountains, and on the other by the &s;ea. The plain, that was &s;ituated between them, mu&s;t have been of con&s;iderable extent, as the two armies en|camped in it; and Darius's army, as we have al|ready ob&s;erved, was va&s;tly numerous. The river Pinarus ran through the middle of this plain, from the mountain to the &s;ea, and divided it nearly into two equal parts.</P>
<P>Alexander drew up his army in the following order. He po&s;ted at the extremity of the right wing, which &s;tood near the mountains, the Argyra|&s;pides, commanded by Nicanor; then the phalanx of Coenus, and afterwards that of Perdiccas, which terminated in the center of the main army. On the extremity of the left wing he po&s;ted the pha|lanx of Amyntas, then that of Ptolemy, and la&s;tly that of Meleager. Thus the famous Macedonian pha|lanx was formed, which we find was compo&s;ed of &s;ix di&s;tinct bodies. Each of the&s;e were headed by able generals; but Alexander, being always gene|rali&s;&s;imo, had con&s;equently the command of the whole army. The hor&s;e were placed on the two wings; the Macedonians with the The&s;&s;alians on the right, and the Peloponne&s;ians with the other allies on the left. Parmenio commanded the left wing; Alexander him&s;elf conducted the right; while the Agrians (led on by Attalus) and &s;ome other troops lately arrived from Greece, were de&s;tined to oppo&s;e tho&s;e whom Darius had po&s;ted on the mountains.</P>
<P>As for Darius's army, it was drawn up in the following order. Having heard that Alexander was
<PB N="240" REF="246">
advancing again&s;t him in battle array, he com|manded thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e, and twenty thou&s;and bowmen, to cro&s;s the river Pinarus, to keep the enemy in awe, and give him time to draw up his army on the hither &s;ide without interruption. In the center he po&s;ted the thirty thou&s;and Greeks in his &s;ervice, who doubtle&s;s were the flower and chie &s;trength of his army, and were not at all inferior in bravery to the Macedonian phalanx, with thirty thou&s;and barbarians on their right, and as many or their left. The field of battle not being able to contain a greater number, the&s;e were all that were placed in the front line, the re&s;t being ranged behind them, and no doubt to a very great depth, con&s;idering the multitude of the Per&s;ian forces. On the mountain which lay to the left, again&s;t Alex|ander's right wing, Darius po&s;ted twenty thou&s;and men, who were &s;o di&s;po&s;ed in the &s;everal windings of the mountains, that &s;ome of them were before Alexander's army, and others behind it.</P>
<P>Darius having put his army in battle array, and appointed commanders to the different parts of it, took po&s;t him&s;elf in the center, according to the cu&s;tom of the Per&s;ian monarchs. He was deter|mined to keep on the hither &s;ide of the river, that &s;o, if the Macedonians attempted to cro&s;s it, he might attack them while in the middle of the &s;tream, and oblige them to fight in that di&s;advan|tageous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This, however, was not &s;ufficient to damp the &s;pirit, nor to check the progre&s;s of Alexander. He boldly advanced to the &s;ide of the river, and plung|ing into it with great impetuo&s;ity, notwith&s;tanding the &s;howers of arrows that were poured upon him by the Per&s;ians, he &s;oon gained the oppo&s;ite &s;hore where attacking the enemy &s;word in hand, he threw them, in a little time, into confu&s;ion. Eagerly de|&s;iring to engage Darius, and to have the glory o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="241" REF="247">
killing him with his own hand, he was ju&s;t upon the point of charging that monarch, when Oxathres, Darius's brother, ob&s;erving the danger to which he was expo&s;ed, ru&s;hed before his chariot with the hor&s;e he commanded. This, though it &s;aved Da|rius's life, was the immediate cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of the battle. The hor&s;es, that drew his chariot, be|came &s;o unruly, and &s;hook the yoke with &s;o much violence, that they almo&s;t overturned the king; who &s;eeing him&s;elf going to fall alive into the hands of his enemies, leaped down, and mounted another chariot. The re&s;t, ob&s;erving this, fled as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and throwing down their arms made the be&s;t of their way. Alexander received a &s;light wound in his thigh, but it was not attended with any bad con&s;equences.</P>
<P>In the mean time, while the Macedonians under their king had routed the Per&s;ians under Darius, the re&s;t of them, who were engaged with the Greeks, met with a &s;touter and more ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance; but Alexander, having pur&s;ued the fugitives a &s;hort way, returned immediately to the field of battle, and attacking the Grecians vigorou&s;ly in flank, he gave them a total and complete overthrow. The enemy now made no further re&s;i&s;tance, but fled pre|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pitately on all &s;ides. Some of them &s;truck into the high road, which led directly to Per&s;ia; others ran into woods and lonely mountains; and a &s;mall number returned to their camp, which the victori|ous army had already taken and plundered. In this battle &s;ixty thou&s;and of the Per&s;ian infantry, and ten thou&s;and hor&s;emen were &s;lain; forty thou&s;and were taken pri&s;oners; while of Alexander's army were fell but two hundred and eighty in all.</P>
<P>With regard to Darius, the in&s;tant he &s;aw his left wing broke, he was one of the fir&s;t who fled in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s chariot; but getting afterwards into craggy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gged places, he mounted on hor&s;eback, throwing

away his bow, &s;hield, and royal mantle; and had it not been for the nece&s;&s;ity Alexander was under of de&s;i&s;ting from the pur&s;uit, in order to return and complete the overthrow of the Greeks, he would probably have fallen alive into the hands of the conqueror.</P>
<P>Sy&s;igambis, Darius's mother, and that monarch's queen (who was al&s;o his &s;i&s;ter) were found remain|ing in the camp, with two of the king's daughters, his &s;on (yet a child) and &s;ome Per&s;ian ladies; for the re&s;t had been carried to Dama&s;cus, with part of Darius's trea&s;ure, and all &s;uch things as contributed only to the luxury and magnificence of his court. No more than three thou&s;and talents were found in his camp; but the re&s;t of the trea&s;ure fell after|wards into the hands of Parmenio, at the taking of the city of Dama&s;cus.</P>
<P>The evening after the engagement Alexander in|vited his chief officers to a fea&s;t, at which him&s;elf pre&s;ided, notwith&s;tanding the wound he had that day received in battle. The fe&s;tivity however had &s;carce begun, when they were interrupted by &s;ad la|mentations from a neighbouring tent, which at fir&s;t they con&s;idered as a fre&s;h alarm; but they were &s;oon informed, that the noi&s;e came from the tent in which the wife and mother of Darius were kept, who were expre&s;&s;ing their &s;orrow for the &s;up|po&s;ed death of that monarch. An eunuch, who had &s;een his cloak in the hands of a &s;oldier, imagin|ing he was killed, brought them the&s;e dreadfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tidings. Alexander immediately &s;ent Leonatas, one of his principal officers, to undeceive them; and next day he him&s;elf paid them a vi&s;it, when he did every thing in his power to comfort and &s;olace them.

<P>Sy&s;igambis was di&s;tingui&s;hed by extraordinary marks of Alexander's favour; Darius him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not have treated her with greater re&s;pect than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d that generous prince.

much as a city belonging to any particular nation, as the common city of all nations, and the centre of their commerce.</P>
<P>Alexander thought it nece&s;&s;ary both for his glory and his intere&s;t to take this city. The &s;pring was now coming on. Tyre was at that time &s;eated in an i&s;land of the &s;ea, about a quarter of a league from the continent. It was &s;urrounded with a &s;trong wall, an hundred and fifty feet high, which the waves of the &s;ea wa&s;hed; and the Carthaginians, a colony from Tyre, a mighty people, and &s;ove|reigns of the ocean, promi&s;ed to come to the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of their parent &s;tate. Encouraged, therefore, by the&s;e favourable circum&s;tances, the Tyrians de|termined not to &s;urrender, but to hold out the place to the la&s;t extremity. This re&s;olution, however imprudent, was certainly magnanimous; but it was &s;oon after followed by an act, which was as blame|able as the other was prai&s;e-worthy. Alexander was de&s;irous of gaining the place rather by treaty than by force of arms, and with this view he &s;ent heralds into the town with offers of peace; but the inha|bitants were &s;o far from li&s;tening to his propo&s;als, or endeavouring to avert his re&s;entment by any kind of conce&s;&s;ion, that they actually killed his am|ba&s;&s;adors, and threw their bodies from the top of the walls into the &s;ea. It is ea&s;y to imagine what effect &s;o &s;hocking an outrage mu&s;t produce in a mind like Alexander's. He in&s;tantly re&s;olved to be&s;iege the place, and not to de&s;i&s;t till he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it, and razed it to the ground.</P>
<P>As Tyre was divided from the continent by an arm of the &s;ea, there was nece&s;&s;ity for filling up the intermediate &s;pace with a bank or pier, before the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace could be clo&s;ely inve&s;ted. This work, ac|cordingly, was immediately undertaken, and in a great mea&s;ure completed, when all the wood, of which it was principally compo&s;ed, was unexpect|edly
<PB N="248" REF="254">
burned by means of a fire-&s;hip &s;ent in by the enemy. The damage, however, was very &s;oon re|paired, and the mole rendered more perfect than formerly, and carried nearer to the town, when all of a &s;udden a furious tempe&s;t aro&s;e, which under|mining the &s;tone-work that &s;upported the wood, laid the whole at once in the bottom of the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Two &s;uch di&s;a&s;ters, following &s;o clo&s;e on the heels of each other, would have cooled the ardour of almo&s;t any man except Alexander; but nothing could daunt his invincible &s;pirit, or make him re|linqui&s;h an enterprize he had once undertaken. He therefore re&s;olved to pro&s;ecute the &s;iege; and in order to encourage his men to &s;econd his views, he took care to in&s;pire them with a belief that heaven was on their &s;ide, and would &s;oon crown their labours with the wi&s;hed-for &s;ucce&s;s. At one time he gave out, that Apollo was about to abandon the Tyrians to their doom; and that, to prevent his flight, they had bound him to his pede&s;tal with a golden chain: at another he pretended, that Her|cules, the tutelar deity of Macedon, had appeared to him, and, having opened pro&s;pects of the mo&s;t glorious kind, had invited him to proceed to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Tyre. The&s;e favourable circum|&s;tances were announced by the augurs, as intimations from above; and every heart was, of con&s;equence, cheered. The &s;oldiers, as if but that moment ar|rived before the city, now forgetting all the toils they had undergone, and the di&s;appointments they had &s;uffered, began to rai&s;e a new mole, at which they worked ince&s;&s;antly.</P>
<P>To protect them from being annoyed by the &s;hips of the enemy, Alexander fitted out a fleet, with which he not only &s;ecured his own men, but offered the Tyrians battle; which, however, they thought proper to decline, and withdrew all their gallies into the harbour.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="255">The be&s;iegers, now allowed to proceed unmo|le&s;ted, went on with the work with the utmo&s;t vi|gour, and in a little time completed it, and brought it clo&s;e to the walls. A general attack was there|fore re&s;olved on, both by &s;ea and land; and with this view the king having manned his gallies, and joined them together with &s;trong cables, ordered them to approach the walls about midnight, and attack the city with re&s;olution. But ju&s;t as the a&s;&s;ault was going to begin, a dreadful &s;torm aro&s;e, which not only &s;hook the &s;hips a&s;under, but even &s;hattered them in a terrible manner, &s;o that they were all of them obliged to be towed towards the &s;hore, without having made the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on the city.</P>
<P>The Tyrians were elated with this gleam of good fortune: but their joy was but of &s;hort duration; for in a little time after they received intelligence from Carthage, that they mu&s;t expect no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that quarter, as the Carthaginians them&s;elves were then overawed by a powerful army of Syra|cu&s;ans, who had invaded their country. Reduced, therefore, to the hard nece&s;&s;ity of depending en|tirely upon their own &s;trength and their own re|&s;ources, the Tyrians &s;ent all their women and chil|dren to Carthage, and prepared to encounter the very la&s;t extremities. For now the enemy were attacking the place with greater &s;pirit and activity than ever. And, to do the Tyrians ju&s;tice, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that they employed a num|ber of methods of defence, which, con&s;idering the rude &s;tate of the art of war at that early period, were really a&s;toni&s;hing. They warded off the darts di&s;charged from the bali&s;tas again&s;t them, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of turning-wheels, which either broke them to pieces, or carried them another way. They deadened the violence of the &s;tones that were hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led at them, by &s;etting up &s;ails and curtains, made of a &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, which ea&s;ily gave way.
<PB N="250" REF="256">
To annoy the &s;hips which advanced again&s;t their walls, they fixed grappling irons and &s;cythes to joi&s;ts or beams; then &s;training their catapultas (an enormous kind of cro&s;s-bow) they laid tho&s;e great pieces of timber upon them in&s;tead of arrows, and &s;hot them off on a &s;udden at the enemy: the&s;e cru&s;hed &s;ome of their &s;hips by their great weight, and, by means of the hooks or hanging &s;cythes, tore others to pieces. They al&s;o had brazen &s;hields, which they drew red-hot out of the fire; and fill|ing the&s;e with burning &s;and, hurled them in an in|&s;tant from the top of the wall upon the enemy. There was nothing the Macedonians dreaded &s;o much as this fatal in&s;trument; for the moment the burning &s;and got to the fle&s;h through the crevices of the armour, it penetrated to the very bone, and &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e that there was no pulling it off; &s;o that the &s;oldiers throwing down their arms, and tearing their clothes to pieces, were in this man|ner expo&s;ed, naked and defencele&s;s, to the &s;hot of the enemy.</P>
<P>Alexander finding the re&s;ources, and even the courage of the Tyrians increa&s;ed, in proportion as the &s;iege continued, re&s;olved to make a la&s;t effort, and attack them at once both by &s;ea and land, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to overwhelm them with the multiplicity of dangers to which they would be thus expo&s;ed. With this view having manned his gal|lies with &s;ome of the brave&s;t of his troops, he com|manded them to advance again&s;t the enemy's fleet, while he him&s;elf took po&s;t at the head of his men on the mole. And now the attack began on all &s;ides with irre&s;i&s;tible and unremitting fury. Where|ever the battering-rams had beat down any part of the wall, and the bridges were thrown out, in&s;tantly the Argyra&s;pides mounted the breach with the ut|mo&s;t valour, being led on by Admetus, one of the brave&s;t officers in the army, who was killed by
<PB N="251" REF="257">
the thru&s;t of a &s;pear, as he was encouraging his &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of the king, and the example he &s;et, fired his troops with unu&s;ual bravery. He him&s;elf a&s;cended one of the towers on the mole, which was of a prodigious height, and there was expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t dangers he had ever yet en|countered; for being immediately known by his in&s;ignia, and the richne&s;s of his armour, he &s;erved as a mark for all the arrows of the enemy. On this occa&s;ion he performed wonders, killing with javelins &s;everal of tho&s;e who defended the wall; then advancing nearer to them, he forced &s;ome with his &s;word, and others with his &s;hield, either into the city, or the &s;ea, the tower on which he fought almo&s;t touching the wall. He &s;oon a&s;cended the wall, followed by his principal officers, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of two towers, and the &s;pace between them. The battering-rams had already made &s;e|veral breaches; the fleet had forced its way into the harbour; and &s;ome of the Macedonians had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the towers which were aban|doned. The Tyrians &s;eeing the enemy ma&s;ters of their rampart, retired towards an open place, called Agenor, and there &s;tood their ground; but Alex|ander marching up with his regiment of body|guards, killed part of them, and obliged the re&s;t to fly. At the &s;ame time Tyre being taken on that &s;ide which lay towards the harbour, a general car|nage of the citizens en&s;ued, and none were &s;pared, except the few that fell into the hands of the Sido|nians in Alexander's army, who con&s;idering the Ty|rians as countrymen, granted them protection, and carried them privately on board their &s;hips. The numbers that were &s;laughtered on this occa&s;ion are almo&s;t incredible: even after conque&s;t the victor's re&s;entment did not &s;ub&s;ide; he ordered no le&s;s than two thou&s;and men, who were taken in the &s;torm,
<PB N="252" REF="258">
to be nailed to cro&s;&s;es along the the &s;hore. The number of pri&s;oners amounted to thirty thou&s;and, and were all &s;old as &s;laves in different parts of the world. Thus fell Tyre, that had been for many ages the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city in the world, and had &s;pread the arts of commerce into the remote&s;t regions.</P>
<P>While Alexander was employed in the &s;iege of Tyre, he received a &s;econd letter from Darius, in which that monarch treated him with greater re|&s;pect than before. He now gave him the title of king; he offered him ten thou&s;and talents as a ran|&s;om for his captive mother and queen; and he pro|mi&s;ed him his daughter Statira in marriage, with all the country he had conquered as far as the river Euphrates, provided he would agree to a peace. The&s;e terms were &s;o advantageous, that when the king debated upon them in council, Parmenio, one of his generals, could not help ob&s;erving, that he would certainly accept of them, were he Alex|ander. <Q REND="inline">"And &s;o would I," replied the king, "were I Parmenio."</Q> But deeming it incon&s;i&s;tent with his dignity to li&s;ten to any propo&s;als from a man whom he had &s;o lately overcome, he haughtily rejected them, and &s;corned to accept of that as a favour which he already con&s;idered as his own by conque&s;t.</P>
<P>From Tyre Alexander marched to Jeru&s;alem, fully determined to puni&s;h that city for having re|fu&s;ed to &s;upply his army with provi&s;ions during the &s;iege; but his re&s;entment was mollified by a depu|tation of the citizens coming out to meet him, with their high-prie&s;t, <HI>Jaddua,</HI> before them, dre&s;&s;ed in white, and having a mitre on his head, on the front of which the name of God was written. The moment the king perceived the high-prie&s;t, he ad|vanced towards him with an air of the mo&s;t profound re&s;pect, bowed his body, adored the augu&s;t name upon
<PB N="253" REF="259">
his front, and &s;aluted him who wore it with religious veneration. And when &s;ome of his courtiers ex|pre&s;&s;ed their &s;urpri&s;e, that he, who was adored by every one, &s;hould adore the high-prie&s;t of the Jews, <Q REND="inline">"I do not," &s;aid he, "adore the high-prie&s;t, but the God who&s;e mini&s;ter he is; for whil&s;t I was at Dium in Macedonia, my mind wholly fixed on the great de&s;ign of the Per&s;ian war, as I was revolving the methods how to conquer A&s;ia, this very man, dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame robes, appeared to me in a dream, exhorted me to bani&s;h my fear, bade me cro&s;s the Helle&s;pont boldly, and a&s;&s;ured me that God would march at the head of my army, and give me the victory over the Per&s;ians."</Q> This &s;peech, delivered with an air of &s;incerity, no doubt had its effect in encouraging the army, and e&s;tabli&s;hing an opinion that his mi&s;&s;ion was from heaven.</P>
<P>From Jeru&s;alem he went to Gaza, where having met with a more ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance than he ex|pected, he cut the whole garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of ten thou&s;and men, to pieces; and not &s;atisfied with this act of cruelty, he cau&s;ed holes to be bored through the heels of Boetis, the governor, and tying him with cords to the back of his chariot, he dragged him in this manner round the walls of the city. This he did in imitation of Achilles, whom Homer de&s;cribes as having dragged Hector round the walls of Troy in the &s;ame manner; but it was reading the poet to very little, or rather indeed to very bad purpo&s;e, to imitate his hero in the mo&s;t unworthy part of his character.</P>
<P>Alexander, having left a garri&s;on in Gaza, turned his arms towards Egypt, of which he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter without oppo&s;ition. Here he formed the de|&s;ign of vi&s;iting the temple of Jupiter, which was &s;ituated in the &s;andy de&s;erts of Lybia, at the di&s;tance of twelve days journey from Memphis, the capital of Egypt. His chief view in going thither was to
<PB N="254" REF="260">
get him&s;elf acknowledged the &s;on of Jupiter, an honour he had long a&s;pired to. In this journey he founded the city of Alexandria, which &s;oon be|came one of the mo&s;t capital towns in the world for commerce. Nothing could be more dreary than the de&s;ert through which he pa&s;&s;ed, nor any thing more charming, according to the fabulous accounts of the poets, than the particular &s;pot where the temple was &s;ituated. It was a perfect paradi&s;e in the mid&s;t of an immea&s;urable wild. At la&s;t having reached the place, and appeared before the altar of the deity, the prie&s;t, who was no &s;tranger to Alexander's wi&s;hes, declared him to be the &s;on of Jupiter. The conqueror, elated with this high compliment, a&s;ked, whether he &s;hould have &s;ucce&s;s in his expedition: the prie&s;t an&s;wered, that he &s;hould be monarch of the world. The conqueror enquired, if his father's murderers were puni&s;hed: the prie&s;t replied, that his father Jupiter was immortal, but that the murderers of Philip had been all extirpated.</P>
<P>From this time forward Alexander &s;uppo&s;ed him|&s;elf, or would have it &s;uppo&s;ed by others, that he was the &s;on of Jupiter. Tran&s;ported however, as he was, with the idea of being of divine origin, he never forgot the duties of humanity, nor even tho&s;e of genero&s;ity, to his female captives. For Statira, Darius's con&s;ort, dying in child-bed about this period, he honoured her with as grand and mag|nificent a funeral as &s;he could have received, had &s;he expired in her hu&s;band's palace. Darius was &s;o deeply affected with this act of magnanimity in his enemy, that, upon receiving the fir&s;t intelligence of it, he is &s;aid to have lift up his eyes to heaven, and to have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus: <Q REND="inline">"Ye Gods, the guardians of our births, and who decree the fate of nations, grant that I may be enabled to leave the Per&s;ian &s;tate as rich and flouri&s;hing as I &s;ound

it, that I may have it in my power to make Alex|ander a proper return for his genero&s;ity to the deare&s;t objects of my affection.

<P>Generous, however, as Alexander was to the wife and mother of Darius, he &s;till refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to any terms of accommodation from that monarch him&s;elf, who was therefore obliged to a&s;&s;emble ano|ther army, in order, at lea&s;t, to make one effort more for the pre&s;ervation of his crown and empire. He accordingly exerted him&s;elf with great &s;pirit and activity, and in a little time was able to rai&s;e a &s;econd army half as numerous again as the former; and with this he now advanced towards the Tigris, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent Alexander from pa&s;&s;ing that river. This, however, he was not able to effect. Alexander pa&s;&s;ed the Tigris with greater ea&s;e and rapidity than he had pa&s;&s;ed the Granicus; and drawing up his army, on the farther bank, he continued there encamped for two days in expecta|tion of the enemy. But finding that Darius was not di&s;po&s;ed to come in &s;earch of him, he re&s;olved to go in que&s;t of Darius. The minds of his men, however, were con&s;iderably damped by an eclip&s;e of the moon, which happened about that time; for as the cau&s;e of this phaenomenon was not then known, it was always &s;uppo&s;ed to be the progno&s;tic of &s;ome great calamity. But Alexander who was as good a politician as a &s;oldier, immediately produced &s;ome Egyptian &s;ooth&s;ayers, who declared, that the eclip&s;e portended calamities not to the Greeks, but to the Per&s;ians. And having, by this artful con|trivance, revived the &s;pirits of his men, he led them on to meet the enemy, and began his march at midnight.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="262">At break of day he received intelligence, that Darius was but twenty miles di&s;tant; and at the &s;ame time a me&s;&s;enger arrived from that monarch with fre&s;h propo&s;als of peace, which were &s;till more advantageous than the former. But Alexander re|jected all his offers; proudly replying, that the world would not admit of two &s;uns, nor of two &s;overeigns. All hopes of accommodation, there|fore, being now cut off, both &s;ides prepared them|&s;elves for battle, equally irritated, and equally am|bitious. Darius pitched his camp in a plain near the village of Gangamela, and at &s;ome di&s;tance from the city of Arbela, from which la&s;t place the battle that en&s;ued is u&s;ually denominated.</P>
<P>Alexander being informed of this, continued his march till he arrived within a few miles of the enemy. He there encamped, and having re&s;ted four days, in order to refre&s;h his army, he &s;et out on the evening of the fifth, with a view of attack|ing Darius at day-break; but upon his arrival at the mountains, where he could di&s;cover the enemy's army, he made a halt, and having a&s;&s;embled his general officers, he held a con&s;ultation with them whether they &s;hould engage immediately, or pitch their camp in that place. The latter expedient was deemed the mo&s;t eligible, as it would give them an opportunity of viewing the field of battle, and the manner in which the enemy were drawn up. They therefore encamped in the &s;ame order in which they marched; and, in the mean time, Alexander, at the head of his light armed infan|try, and his royal regiments, marched round the plain in which the battle was to be fought.</P>
<P>Parmento advi&s;ed him to attack the enemy by night, and take them by &s;urprize, as by this means he would be &s;ure of giving them a complete over|throw; but Alexander replied, that he &s;corned to &s;teal a victory, and that he was determined to fight
<PB N="257" REF="263">
and conquer in broad day-light. So confident, indeed, was he of &s;ucce&s;s, that the night imme|diately preceding the action he &s;lept more &s;oundly than he commonly was wont to do, &s;o that Parmenio was obliged to awake him in the morning; and upon that general's expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e at his calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure on the eve of a battle, in which his whole fortune lay at &s;take, <Q REND="inline">"How can I, replied he, be otherwi&s;e than calm, when I &s;ee that the enemy is come to deliver him&s;elf into my hands?"</Q> So &s;aying, he took up his arms, mounted his hor&s;e, and rode up and down the ranks, exhort|ing his men to behave gallantly, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;urpa&s;s their former fame, and the glory they had al|ready acquired.</P>
<P>The i&s;&s;ue of this battle was &s;uch as might natu|rally be expected from the character of the comba|tants. On the one &s;ide was a middling army of forty thou&s;and foot, and about &s;even or eight thou|&s;and hor&s;e; but the&s;e were the brave&s;t and be&s;t di&s;|ciplined troops at that time in the world: on the other was a va&s;t and almo&s;t innumerable a&s;&s;emblage of men, rather than of &s;oldiers, without order, without di&s;cipline, and con&s;equently without any common or well directed courage. The Greeks, indeed, in Darius's pay, formed an exception to this general character of his forces; and they behaved on this, as on every other occa&s;ion, with a &s;pirit worthy of their former fame. But nothing could re&s;i&s;t the ardour and impetuo&s;ity of Alexander at the head of his gallant Macedonians, e&s;pecially as he had taken care, with his u&s;ual addre&s;s, to rein|force their native courage with the aid of &s;uper&s;ti|tion. For in the very heat of the action, Ari&s;tander, the &s;ooth&s;ayer, clothed in his white robes, and hold|ing a branch of laurel in his hand, advanced into the thicke&s;t of the fight, according to the orders he had received from the king; and crying out,
<PB N="258" REF="264">
that he &s;aw an eagle hovering over Alexander's head (a &s;ure omen of victory) he &s;hewed, with his finger, the pretended bird to the &s;oldiers; who re|lying on the veracity of the &s;ooth&s;ayer, imagined that they &s;aw it al&s;o, and now believing them&s;elves invincible, they renewed the attack with greater &s;pirit than ever, and in a little time carried all be|fore them.</P>
<P>Alexander expo&s;ed him&s;elf to danger like the meane&s;t &s;oldier in his army. He wounded Darius's equerry with a javelin; and had not that prince &s;aved him&s;elf by a precipitate flight, he would pro|bably have wounded or killed him likewi&s;e. Alex|ander pur&s;ued the fugitives for a conderable way, but was obliged to return, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t Par|menio, who commanded the left wing, and had not yet been able to break the Per&s;ian hor&s;e that op|po&s;ed him. The&s;e, however, he di&s;comfited be|fore the arrival of Alexander, who met the enemy retiring from the field of battle, and put them al|mo&s;t all to the &s;word. And now the Per&s;ians being defeated every where, betook them&s;elves to flight, and were hotly pur&s;ued by the Macedonians, who committed terrible havock among them. Alex|ander rode after Darius as far as Arbela, hoping every moment to overtake him; and he had almo&s;t done &s;o, for he reached that city ju&s;t as Darius had quitted it; but though the latter was thus able to &s;ave his per&s;on, he was obliged to leave his trea&s;ure behind him, which now fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>Such was the i&s;&s;ue of this famous battle, which gave to Alexander the empire of A&s;ia. The lo&s;s of the Per&s;ians on this occa&s;ion was incredible. It amounted, according to Arrian, to three hundred thou&s;and men, be&s;ides tho&s;e who were taken pri|&s;oners; whereas the lo&s;s of the Macedonians was, comparatively &s;peaking, very incon&s;iderable, it not
<PB N="259" REF="265">
exceeding, according to the &s;ame author, twelve hundred men, and mo&s;t of the&s;e were cavalry.</P>
<P>The dreadful defeat, which Darius had now &s;u&s;|tained, &s;truck &s;uch a terror into the neighbouring provinces, that Alexander met with little or no more oppo&s;ition, in making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole kingdom of Per&s;ia. Babylon &s;urrendered to him without &s;triking a blow, as did al&s;o Su&s;a; and in both the&s;e places he found immen&s;e trea&s;ures. Leaving the mother and children of Darius in Su&s;a, he advanced into the country of the Uxii, where he met with &s;ome &s;light re&s;i&s;tance from Madathes, the governor, but this he &s;oon overcame, and pardoned Madathes at the interce&s;&s;ion of Sy&s;igambis, to whom that &s;atrap was nearly related. Thence he continued his march towards Per&s;epolis, which he did with the greater expedition, as he had received in|telligence from Tiridates, who commanded in that city, that the inhabitants were preparing to plunder Darius's trea&s;ures: but Alexander took care to prevent them by his unexpected arrival, and di&s;|tributed all the wealth he found there, as well as in other places, among the brave&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;erving of his &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>As he approached this city, he was met by a large body of men, who exhibited a &s;triking ex|ample of the exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery, which human beings are &s;ometimes doomed to &s;uffer. The&s;e were about four thou&s;and Greeks, very far advanced in years, who, having been made pri&s;oners of war, had un|dergone all the torments which the Per&s;ian tyranny could inflict. The hands of &s;ome had been cut off, the feet of others; and others again had lo&s;t their no&s;es and ears. They appeared like &s;o many &s;pectres, rather than like men; &s;peech being almo&s;t the only thing by which they were known to be &s;uch. Alexander could not refrain from tears at this &s;ight; and as they irre&s;i&s;tibly moved him to
<PB N="260" REF="266">
commi&s;erate their condition, he bade them, with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s, not to de&s;pond, and a&s;&s;ured them, that they &s;hould again &s;ee their wives and country. They cho&s;e, however, to remain in a place where misfortune was now became habitual: he therefore rewarded them liberally for their &s;uf|ferings, and commanded the governor of the pro|vince to treat them with mildne&s;s and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Alexander, upon his fir&s;t entry into Per&s;epolis, was &s;atisfied with the trea&s;ures he found there, and &s;eems not to have thought of wreaking his re&s;ent|ment upon any part of the city it&s;elf. But one day having drank to exce&s;s at a public banquet, and the conver&s;ation turning upon the cruelties com|mitted by the Per&s;ians in Greece, and particularly at Athens, Thais, an Athenian courtezan, who was pre&s;ent, &s;eized this opportunity of &s;aying, that it was mean and pu&s;illanimous, in the highe&s;t de|gree, not to take revenge for &s;uch repeated &s;laughters. <Q REND="inline">"This day, cried &s;he, has fully repaid all my wan|derings and troubles in A&s;ia, by putting it in my power, to humble the pride of the Per&s;ian mo|narchs. To in&s;ult over the palace of Per&s;epolis will be a noble deed; but how much more glorious would it be to fire the palace of that Xerxes, who laid the city of Athens in ruins; and to have it told in future times, that a &s;ingle woman, of Alexander's train, had taken more &s;ignal vengeance on the ene|mies of Greece, than all her former generals had been able to do!"</Q> All the gue&s;ts applauded the di&s;|cour&s;e; when immediately the king, in a fit of phrenzy, ro&s;e from table (his head being crowned with flowers) and taking a torch in his hand, he advanced forward, to execute his mad exploit. The whole company followed him, breaking out into &s;houts of joy, and in a riotous manner with &s;inging and dancing, &s;urrounded the palace. All the re&s;t of the Macedonians, at this noi&s;e, ran in
<PB N="261" REF="267">
crowds, with lighted torches, and &s;et fire to every part of it. However, Alexander &s;oon repented of what he had done, and thereupon gave orders for extingui&s;hing the fire; but it was now too late.</P>
<P>In the mean time Darius continued his flight, and at length arrived at Ecbatana, the capital of Media. But though he was able to e&s;cape the pur|&s;uit of his natural enemies, he could not &s;ecure him&s;elf from the &s;ecret de&s;igns of his treacherous &s;ubjects. Two of them in particular, Nabarzanes and Be&s;&s;us, the one the general of the hor&s;e, the other the commander of the Bactrians, had entered into a plot to &s;eize his per&s;on; and either deliver him alive into the hands of Alexander, if they were overtaken; or, if they e&s;caped, to put him to death, and afterwards u&s;urp his crown, and begin a new war. They even found means to draw over to their party all the forces of Darius, except the Greeks in that monarch's pay; who, &s;hocked at the ba&s;ene&s;s of his natural-born &s;ubjects, generou&s;ly offered to protect his per&s;on at the hazard of their own lives. But Darius was of too noble a &s;pirit to accept of &s;uch a propo&s;al, and he therefore re|plied, that if his own &s;ubjects would not grant him protection, he could not think of receiving it from the hands of &s;trangers. The Greeks &s;eeing they could be of no further &s;ervice to him, immediately threw them&s;elves on the mercy of Alexander, who, in con&s;ideration of their gallant &s;pirit, not only forgave them, but enrolled them among his own forces.</P>
<P>Darius, being thus left de&s;titute of all kind of re&s;ource, was &s;eized by the traitors, who put him in chains, and carried him along with them for &s;ome time; but finding that the Macedonians were in clo&s;e pur&s;uit of them, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible for them either to conciliate the friend&s;hip of Alex|ander,
<PB N="262" REF="268">
or to &s;ecure a crown for them&s;elves, they again &s;et him at liberty, and advi&s;ed him to accom|pany them in their flight. This, however, he re|fu&s;ed to do; and calling upon heaven to revenge the indignities they had already offered him, he openly declared, that he would rather tru&s;t to the mercy of Alexander, than continue any longer in the hands of traitors. At the&s;e words they fell into a furious pa&s;&s;ion, and thru&s;ting him through with their darts and &s;pears, they left him, in that manner, to linger out the remains of his wretched life. The traitors then made their e&s;cape different ways; while the victorious Macedonians, at length coming up, found Darius in a lonely place, lying in his chariot, and drawing near his end. However, he had &s;trength enough, before he died, to call for drink; which a Ma|cedonian, named Poly&s;tratus, brought him. The genero&s;ity of the unfortunate monarch &s;hone forth, on this melancholy occa&s;ion, in the addre&s;s he made to this &s;tranger: <Q REND="inline">"Now indeed, &s;aid he, I &s;uffer the extremity of mi&s;ery, &s;ince it is not in my power to reward thee for this act of humanity."</Q> He had a Per&s;ian pri&s;oner, whom he employed as his inter|preter. Darius, after drinking the liquor that had been given him, turned to the Macedonian, and &s;aid, that in the deplorable &s;tate to which he was reduced, he however, &s;hould have the comfort to &s;peak to one who could under&s;tand him, and that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s la&s;t words would not be lo&s;t. He therefore charged him to tell Alexander, that he had died in his debt; that he gave him many thanks for the great humanity he had exerci&s;ed towards his mother, his wife, and his children, who&s;e lives he had not only &s;pared, but re&s;tored them to their former &s;plendor; that he be&s;ought the gods to give victory to his arms, and make him &s;overeign of the uni|ver&s;e; and that he thought he need not entreat him
<PB N="263" REF="269">
to revenge the execrable murder committed on his per&s;on, as this was the common cau&s;e of kings.</P>
<P>After this, taking Poly&s;tratus by the hand, <Q REND="inline">"give him," &s;aid he, thy hand, as I give thee mine; and carry him, in my name, the only pledge I am able to give of my gratitude and affection."</Q> Saying the&s;e words, he breathed his la&s;t.</P>
<P>Alexander, upon coming up, and viewing the dead body of Darius, was deeply affected; he ge|nerou&s;ly paid it the tribute of a tear; he cau&s;ed it to be embalmed, and inclo&s;ed in a magnificent coffin; and he &s;ent it to Sy&s;igambis, in order to be interred with the honours u&s;ually paid to the Per&s;ian monarchs. At the &s;ame time he pur|&s;ued the traitor Be&s;&s;us, and having taken him pri|&s;oner, and cut off his no&s;e and ears, he cau&s;ed him to be conveyed to Ecbatana, there to &s;uffer what|ever puni&s;hment Darius's mother &s;hould think pro|per to inflict upon him. He was accordingly put to death in the following manner. Four trees were bent by main force, all towards the &s;ame point, and to each of the&s;e one of the limbs of this traitor's b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dy was fa&s;tened; and then the trees being &s;uffered t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> return to their natural po&s;ition, they flew back with &s;o much violence, that each tore away the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mb that was fixed to it, and &s;o quartered him.</P>
<P>It was about this time that Alexander is &s;aid to have received a vi&s;it from Thale&s;tris, queen of the Amazons; but this circum&s;tance, though related as a fact by &s;ome hi&s;torians, is con&s;idered as a fable by the mo&s;t judicious writers.</P>
<P>Among the many good qualities of Alexander, his gallantry and genero&s;ity to the female &s;ex was not the lea&s;t remarkable. Of this he now gave a &s;triking in&s;tance in his behaviour to a Per&s;ian fe|male captive, whom having di&s;covered, by her mode&s;t and re&s;erved air while &s;he was &s;inging at
<PB N="264" REF="270">
one of his public banquets, to be a prince&s;s of the blood-royal, he not only &s;et her at liberty, but re|turned her all her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and even cau&s;ed her hu&s;band, Hy&s;ta&s;pes, to be &s;ought for, in order that &s;he might be re&s;tored to him.</P>
<P>The grandeur and elevation of Alexander's mind appears in nothing more con&s;picuous than this, that he always accu&s;tomed his men to con&s;ider their pre|&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, however great, as nothing in com|pari&s;on of what he would one day be&s;tow upon them. Perceiving that they were now &s;o encumbered with booty, as to be incapable of marching with their u&s;ual celerity and di&s;patch, he commanded them to carry all their baggage (excepting only &s;uch things as were indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary) into a large plain, and there to commit it to the flames.</P>
<P>We have hitherto beheld the fair &s;ide of Alex|ander's character. We mu&s;t now rever&s;e the pic|ture, and take a view of his bad, as well as his good qualities; for no man ever had a more mixed character, or united, in a more eminent degree, the extremes both of virtue and of vice. Hearing that Philotas, one of his chief favourites (and who was likewi&s;e the &s;on of Parmenio) had received in|telligence of a plot formed again&s;t him, and had neglected to inform him of it, he immediately concluded that that nobleman him&s;elf was concerned in the con&s;piracy; and he accordingly had him fir&s;t put to the rack, and afterwards &s;toned to death. Philotas, in the agony of pain, had acknowledged him&s;elf guilty, and named &s;everal of his accomplices, and, among others, his own father. The con&s;e|quence was, that Parmenio, though entirely in|nocent, was likewi&s;e put to death; and in this act Alexander was at once guilty of inju&s;tice, cruelty, and ingratitude; for Parmenio had contributed more to the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms than perhaps any of his other generals.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="271">In order to prevent the ill humour that might have been excited in the army by the&s;e acts of &s;eve|rity, Alexander &s;et out in que&s;t of new nations whom he might &s;ubdue. He totally extirpated the Branchiae, merely on account of their being de|&s;cended from &s;ome traiterous Greeks, that had de|livered up the trea&s;ures of a temple, with which they had been entru&s;ted. The &s;ucce&s;s of his arms again&s;t the Scythians is very problematical. Ac|cording to Arrian and Quintus Curtius, he was able to make little or no impre&s;&s;ion on the bold and un|tractable &s;pirit of the&s;e barbarians. Curtius even &s;ays, that the Scythians gave the Greeks &s;o terrible a de|feat, that Alexander made it death for any one, who had e&s;caped from the battle, to make the lea&s;t men|tion of it. He adds, that they &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Alexander, who had the courage to tell him to his face, that he, who pretended to have no other view in all his military enterpri&s;es than the extirpation of robbers, was him&s;elf the greate&s;t robber that ex|i&s;ted. It appears, however, that after taking and plundering the city of Cyropolis, and cro&s;&s;ing the river Jaxerthes, he defeated a body of thirty thou|&s;and Scythians who were po&s;ted in a &s;trong hold called Petra Oxiani, and having met with a more ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance than he expected, he redu|ced the common men to &s;lavery, and cau&s;ed their leaders to be fixed to cro&s;&s;es at the bottom of the rock that formed the pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Having thus opened to him&s;elf a way into the heart of the country, he advanced fir&s;t into the province of Bar&s;aria, and afterwards into that of Maracanda, of which la&s;t he appointed Clitus go|vernor. But it was not long before this brave and de&s;erving officer met with the &s;ame fate as Par|menio. For having taken upon him, at a public entertainment, where he had drank too freely, to depreciate the king's achievements in compari&s;on of
<PB N="266" REF="272">
tho&s;e of his father Philip, Alexander, who was likewi&s;e very much intoxicated, was &s;o tran&s;ported with pa&s;&s;ion, that taking up a javelin, he laid Cli|tus dead at his feet. He had no &s;ooner committed this barbarous action, than he was &s;eized with the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t bitter affliction. He threw him|&s;elf upon the dead body; he forced out the javelin, and had he not been prevented by the by-&s;tanders, he would in&s;tantly have plunged it in his own brea&s;t. For &s;ome time he continued in a &s;tate of the deepe&s;t melancholy: but at la&s;t having reco|vered his u&s;ual &s;erenity, he &s;et out in que&s;t of new adventures, and entering the country of the Sacae, he was met by Axertes, one of its kings, who&s;e daughter, Roxana, he married.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ubdued all the Per&s;ian provinces, he re&s;olved to carry his arms as far as India, a country deemed at that time, as well as at pre&s;ent, one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;irable in the world. This country, on both &s;ides of the Ganges, was then inhabited by a people, not very unlike the pre|&s;ent Gentoos, or native Indians. They were divided into &s;even ca&s;ts or cla&s;&s;es, which always kept &s;epa|rate and di&s;tinct from each other, no per&s;on of one cla&s;s being permitted to intermarry with one of another; nor any one being allowed to belong to two or more cla&s;&s;es, or to quit one cla&s;s for another. The fir&s;t cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of the guardians of religion; the &s;econd of hu&s;bandmen; the third of &s;hepherds; the fourth of merchants and trade&s;men, including pilots and &s;eamen; the fifth of &s;oldiers; the &s;ixth of magi&s;trates; and the &s;eventh of per&s;ons employed in the public councils, and who a&s;&s;i&s;ted the &s;overeign in the government of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Upon entering this country, Alexander received the voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t of the petty princes that reigned in it. Having reduced Hago&s;a, he attacked the rock of Aornos, which was con&s;idered
<PB N="267" REF="273">
as impregnable, and was &s;aid to have foiled the prowe&s;s even of Hercules him&s;elf; but the garri&s;on, &s;truck with the va&s;tne&s;s of his military preparations, delivered it up after a very faint re&s;i&s;tance. This helped to inflame his natural pride and vanity, in having been able &s;o ea&s;ily to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of a fortre&s;s, that had bid defiance to the might of the great founder of his race.</P>
<P>From thence he proceeded towards the river Indus, and continued his march to the banks of the Hy|da&s;pes, receiving every where, as he pa&s;&s;ed, the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the neighbouring princes, and, among others, that of Omphis, who made him a pre&s;ent of fifty-&s;ix elephants. There was one of them, however, (named Porus) who di&s;dained to relinqui&s;h his independent &s;ituation without a &s;truggle; and Alexander, therefore, re&s;olved to compel him by force of arms. A bloody battle accordingly was fought between them; and though Porus behaved with extraordinary valour, and performed both the duty of an able commander and a gallant &s;oldier, being as remarkable for his great &s;trength and &s;ta|ture, as for his uncommon abilities, he was yet obliged, however unwillingly, to re&s;ign the victory to his antagoni&s;t. The lo&s;s of the Indians on this occa&s;ion was great, amounting to no le&s;s than twenty thou&s;and foot, and three thou&s;and hor&s;e; whereas that of the Macedonians did not exceed two hundred and eighty foot, and between thirty and forty hor&s;emen.</P>
<P>Alexander was &s;o charmed with the extraordi|nary merit of Porus, that he was extremely de&s;irous of &s;aving him from the general carnage that fol|lowed the battle. He therefore &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger after him entreating him to return, which with &s;ome difficulty he was prevailed upon to do; and when he came into the king's pre&s;ence, who, the nearer he viewed him, admired him the more,

Alexander a&s;ked him how he wi&s;hed to be treated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <Q REND="inline">"Like a king,"</Q> replied Porus. <Q REND="inline">"But," con|tinued Alexander, "do you a&s;k nothing more?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"No," replied Porus, "all things are included in that &s;ingle word."</Q> Alexander, &s;truck with this greatne&s;s of &s;oul, the magnanimity of which &s;eemed heightened by di&s;tre&s;s, did not only re&s;tore him his kingdom, but annexed other provinces to it, and treated him ever after with the highe&s;t marks of e&s;teem and regard. Porus continued faithful to him till his death. It is hard to &s;ay whether the victor or the vanqui&s;hed de&s;erved mo&s;t prai&s;e upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Alexander built a city on the &s;pot where the bat|tle was fought; and another in the place where he had cro&s;&s;ed the Hyda&s;pes. He called the one Nicaea, from his victory; and the other Bucephalus, in honour of his hor&s;e, who died there, not of wounds, but of old age.</P>
<P>Having now conquered Porus, he advanced into the interior parts of India, and as the people of that country were never remarkable for their mili|tary &s;pirit, he ea&s;ily added it to his former domi|nions. Pa&s;&s;ing by a place, where there were &s;everal Brachmans or Indian Prie&s;ts, he was &s;eized with a de&s;ire of conver&s;ing with them, and of learning, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;omething of the nature of their religion. But hearing that the&s;e prie&s;ts never made vi&s;its, and thinking it below his dignity to vi&s;it them, he &s;ent One&s;icritus, the philo&s;opher, to wait upon them. This man met, in the neighbourhood of the city, fifteen Brachmans, who from morning till evening always &s;tood naked, in the &s;ame po&s;ture in which they had at fir&s;t placed them&s;elves, and afterwards returned to the city at night. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf fir&s;t to Calanus an Indian, reputed the wi&s;e&s;t man of his country, who, though he profe&s;&s;ed the prac|tice of the mo&s;t &s;evere philo&s;ophy, had however
<PB N="269" REF="275">
been per&s;uaded in his extreme old age to attend upon the court, and to him he told the occa&s;ion of his coming. The latter gazing upon One&s;icritus's clothes and &s;hoes, could not forbear laughing; after which he told him, <Q REND="inline">"That anciently the earth had been covered with barley and wheat, as it was at that time with du&s;t; that, be&s;ides water, the rivers u&s;ed to flow with milk, honey, oil and wine; that man's guilt had occa&s;ioned a change of this happy condition; and that Jupiter, to puni&s;h their ingra|titude, had &s;entenced them to a long and painful labour: that their repentance afterwards moving him to compa&s;&s;ion, he had re&s;tored them their for|mer abundance; however that, by the cour&s;e of things, they &s;eemed to be returning to their ancient confu&s;ion."</Q> All nations, even in the very lowe&s;t &s;tages of &s;ociety, &s;eem to have &s;ome notion of a happier &s;tate that preceded the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Oneficritus endeavoured to per&s;uade two of them, named Mandanis and Calodanus, to accompany him to Alexander, telling them they would find him a generous benefactor. The former haughtily rejected the propo&s;al: it was however accepted by the latter. Alexander's chief ambition was to imi|tate Bacchus and Hercules in their expeditions into the ea&s;t, and he therefore re&s;olved to penetrate, like them, as far as he could meet with new nations to con|quer. But now the Macedonians refu&s;ed to follow him, &s;atiated, as they were, with &s;poil, and worn out with repeated encounters; and though he u&s;ed every argument he could think of to overcome their ob&s;tinacy, he yet could &s;ucceed no farther than to obtain their con&s;ent to attend him towards the &s;outh, in order to di&s;cover the neare&s;t ocean, and to take the cour&s;e of the river Indus for their guide.</P>
<P>In his voyage down this river, he gave a &s;ignal proof of that per&s;onal intrepidity, for which he was &s;o to remarkable; for having landed his troops, and
<PB N="270" REF="276">
attacked the capital of the Oxydraci and the Mallis, he &s;eized a &s;caling-ladder, and was the fir&s;t that mounted the wall. His attendants, &s;eeing his dan|ger, endeavoured to follow him; but the ladder breaking, he left alone; upon which, &s;word in hand, he boldly leaped from the wall into the city, which was crowded with enemies. He re|pul&s;ed &s;uch as were neare&s;t him, and he even killed the governor of the place who advanced in the throng. Thus with his back to a tree that hap|pened to be near, he received all the darts of the enemy in his &s;hield, and kept even the bolde&s;t at a di&s;tance. At la&s;t an Indian di&s;charging an arrow of three feet in length, it pierced his coat of mail and his right brea&s;t; and &s;o great a quantity of blood i&s;&s;ued from the wound, that he dropped his arms and lay as dead. The Indian came to &s;trip him, &s;uppo&s;ing him really what he appeared; but Alexander that in&s;tant recovered his &s;pirits, and plunged a dagger in his &s;ide. By this time a part of the king's attendants had come to his &s;uccour, and forming them&s;elves round his body, till the &s;ol|diers without found means to break the gates, they thus &s;aved him, and put all the inhabitants without di&s;tinction to the &s;word.</P>
<P>Having recovered of his wound, in a few days, he continued his voyage down the river, &s;ubduing the country on each &s;ide as he pa&s;&s;ed along; and at la&s;t having reached the &s;hore, he was &s;truck with &s;urpri&s;e at the high tides of the Indian ocean, e&s;pe|cially as he had never beheld any thing of the kind but the gentle floods of the Mediterranean, where there can hardly be &s;aid to be any tides at all. Here he put an end to his expedition; and ca&s;ting his eyes wi&s;tfully on the broad expan&s;e of waters be|fore him, he is &s;aid to have wept at there being no more worlds left for him to conquer. He now therefore re&s;olved to direct his march homewards;
<PB N="271" REF="277">
and having appointed Nearchus admiral of his fleet, with orders to proceed along the Indian &s;hore as far as the Per&s;ian gulph, he &s;et out with his army for Babylon.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t part of this journey was attended with the greate&s;t difficulties on account of the poverty of the country through which they pa&s;&s;ed, and the con&s;equent want of provi&s;ions; but upon their ar|rival in the province of Gedro&s;ia, the riche&s;t di&s;|trict in that part of the world, they found them&s;elves &s;urrounded with all the nece&s;&s;aries, and conveni|encies, and even the luxuries of life, nor were they backward in enjoying them. The fact is, like true &s;oldiers, they gave them&s;elves up to every &s;pecies of intemperance and exce&s;s. Alexander, &s;till wi&s;hing to imitate Bacchus, was drawn by eight hor&s;es, on a &s;caffold in the form of a &s;quare &s;tage, where he pa&s;&s;ed the days and nights in fea&s;ting; and his men, at humble di&s;tance, did not fail to follow his exam|ple. Here he put Cleander to death, whom he had left behind him as the governor of &s;ome provinces, and who had gro&s;sly abu&s;ed his authority during his ma&s;ter's ab&s;ence. As this man had the chief hand in cutting off the unhappy Parmenio, this act of ri|gorous ju&s;tice gave great &s;atisfaction. He likewi&s;e inflicted the &s;ame puni&s;hment upon &s;ix hundred &s;ol|diers, whom Cleander had employed as the in&s;tru|ments of his extortion.</P>
<P>In his way to Babylon he &s;topped at Pa&s;argada, in order to vi&s;it the tomb of Cyrus, upon which was this humble but &s;ignificant in&s;cription.&mdash;"O man, who&s;oever thou art, or whence&s;oever thou come&s;t, I am Cyrus, the founder of the Per&s;ian em|pire; do not envy me this little quantity of earth which covers my body." Here Or&s;ines a Per&s;ian prince being accu&s;ed (though fal&s;ely) of having robbed this tomb, was condemned to &s;uffer a capital puni&s;hment. Here, too, Calanus, the Indian,
<PB N="272" REF="278">
having completed his eighty-third year, without di&s;|ea&s;e or &s;ickne&s;s, and now feeling the approaches of old age, re&s;olved to put him&s;elf to a voluntary death, agreeable to the &s;trange &s;uper&s;tition of the enthu|&s;ia&s;ts of his country. A funeral pile accordingly was erected for him: this, after taking leave of his friends, he boldly a&s;cended, and laying him&s;elf down upon it, and covering his face, he continued im|moveably in that po&s;ture till he expired in the flames.</P>
<P>From Pa&s;argada Alexander proceeded to Su&s;a, where he married Statira, the elde&s;t daughter of Darius; and at the &s;ame time gave her younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter in wedlock to his favourite Hephae&s;tion, and four&s;core Per&s;ian ladies of rank to as many of his principal officers.</P>
<P>But while he was thus amu&s;ing him&s;elf in Per&s;ia, a commotion had like to have been excited in Greece. Harpalus, governor of Babylon, having ama&s;&s;ed immen&s;e riches, and wi&s;hing to acquire an independent authority, had gone over to Athens, and endeavoured to engage the leading men in his intere&s;t, and, among others, the illu&s;trious Phocion, whom we have already mentioned. But this man lent a deaf ear to all his tempting offers, and &s;hewed him&s;elf to be as much proof again&s;t the &s;eductions of Harpalus, as he had formerly been again&s;t tho&s;e of Philip and Alexander. When Philip pre&s;&s;ed him to accept of a large &s;um, if not for him&s;elf, at lea&s;t for his family: <Q REND="inline">"if my children," &s;aid Phocion, "re&s;emble me, the little &s;pot of ground, upon the produce of which I have hitherto lived, will be &s;ufficient to maintain them; if they do not, I would not wi&s;h to leave them wealth, merely to inflame their luxury and ambition."</Q> And when Alexander &s;ent him a hundred talents, Phocion a&s;ked tho&s;e who brought it, why their ma&s;ter had pre&s;ented him with &s;o great a &s;um, and did not remit any to the re&s;t of the Athenians; <Q REND="inline">"it is, replied they, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="273" REF="279">
he looks upon you as the only ju&s;t and vir|tuous man in the &s;tate."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Then, rejoined Pho|cion, let him &s;uffer me &s;till to enjoy that character, and be really what I am taken for."</Q> Harpalus, di&s;appointed in his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s from this quarter, was obliged to abandon the enterprize.</P>
<P>This commotion was &s;carcely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed when another en&s;ued, and &s;eemingly of a more dangerous nature. Alexander had publi&s;hed a declaration, by which all the Macedonians, who from their age or infirmities were incapable of bearing the fatigues of war, were ordered to return to Greece. This they con&s;idered, not only as the highe&s;t affront, but even as the greate&s;t inju&s;tice. They therefore, with &s;editious cries, unanimou&s;ly demanded to be entirely di&s;charged from his &s;ervice, murmuring again&s;t him as a de&s;pi&s;er of his brave&s;t troops, and as a cruel king, who wanted their de&s;truction and not their ab&s;ence. Alexander, however, on this trying occa&s;ion, acted with that re&s;olution, which always marked his character. Being &s;eated on his tribunal of ju&s;tice, he ru&s;hed among the principal mutineers, &s;eized thirteen, and ordered them to be immediately puni&s;hed. The &s;oldiers amazed at his intrepidity, withheld their complaints, and with down-ca&s;t eyes &s;eemed to beg for mercy. <Q REND="inline">"You de&s;ired a di&s;charge," &s;aid he, "go then, and pub|li&s;h to the world, that you have left your prince to the mercy of &s;trangers; from henceforth, the Per|&s;ians &s;hall be my guards."</Q> This menace was ac|tually executed, and filled the &s;oldiers with &s;uch grief and con&s;ternation, that they never cea&s;ed &s;oli|citing his forgivene&s;s, till at la&s;t he was prevailed upon to re&s;tore them to his favour.</P>
<P>Being now &s;ecure from in&s;urrection, he gave him|&s;elf up to mirth and jollity; he &s;pent whole days and nights in immoderate drinking; and in one of tho&s;e bacchanalian entertainments Hephae&s;tion lo&s;t
<PB N="274" REF="280">
his life. As this was the greate&s;t of all Alexander's favourites, his death made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his mind. He &s;eemed ab&s;olutely incapable of receiving con&s;olation; he even put to death the phy&s;ician who attended him; and, on his arrival in Babylon, he celebrated his funeral rites with the greate&s;t pomp and magnificence.</P>
<P>As he drew near to that city, many &s;ini&s;ter omens were ob&s;erved; on which account the Chaldeans, who pretended to fore&s;ee future events, endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from entering it. But the Greek philo&s;ophers di&s;played the futility of the&s;e predictions, and advi&s;ed him to pur&s;ue the cour&s;e which his glory pointed out. Babylon, they told him, was a proper theatre, on which to di&s;play the greatne&s;s of his power, as amba&s;&s;adors were there expecting his arrival from all the nations he had lately conquered. Accordingly, after making a mo&s;t magnificent entry, he gave audience to the amba&s;&s;adors with a grandeur and dignity &s;uitable to his royal character, yet with all the affability and politene&s;s of a private courtier.</P>
<P>As he intended to make Babylon the &s;eat of his empire, he began to form &s;chemes for beautifying and improving that city. But, amid&s;t all his amu&s;e|ments of this kind, and though he had now at|tained to the height of his ambition, he was far from being happy. The recent lo&s;s of Hephae&s;tion, and the &s;ad remembrance he &s;till had of the murder of Clitus, and of the barbarities exerci&s;ed on Parmenio, and his &s;on Philotas; the recollection, I &s;ay, of the&s;e &s;hocking events fe&s;tered in his mind, and threw a gloom upon his &s;pirits; to di&s;&s;ipate which it was nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to &s;ome powerful remedy. The remedy he employed was intemperance. In con&s;equence of this, he was often invited to enter|tainments, at which he drank immoderately. On a particular occa&s;ion, having &s;pent the whole night in a debauch, he was pre&s;&s;ed to engage in a
<PB N="275" REF="281">
&s;econd, which he unhappily did, and drank to &s;uch exce&s;s, that he fell upon the floor, in appearance dead; and in this lifele&s;s condition was carried, a &s;ad &s;pectacle of debauchery, to his palace. The fever continued, with &s;ome intervals, in which he gave the nece&s;&s;ary orders for the &s;ailing of the fleet, and the marching of his land forces, being per&s;uaded he &s;hould recover. But at la&s;t finding him&s;elf pa&s;t all hopes, and his voice beginning to fail, he gave his ring to Perdiccas, with orders to convey his body to the temple of Ammon. He &s;truggled, however, with death for &s;ome time, and rai&s;ing him&s;elf upon his elbow, he gave his hand to the &s;oldiers who pre&s;&s;ed in to ki&s;s it. Being then a&s;ked to whom he would leave his empire, he an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"To the mo&s;t worthy."</Q> Perdiccas inquiring at what time he &s;hould pay him divine honours, he replied, when you are happy. With the&s;e words he expired, being then upwards of thirty-two years old, of which he had reigned twelve with a glory and renown that no prince, either before or &s;ince, has ever been able to equal.</P>
<P>As to his character, it may be &s;ummed up in a few words. Per&s;onal courage, military &s;kin, un|bounded genero&s;ity, unexampled continence, con|&s;idering his youth, his rank, and the powerful temp|tations to which he was expo&s;ed; &s;uch were his chief and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues: but the&s;e were more than counterbalanced by his intemperance, his cruelty, his vanity, and, above all, by his wild and in&s;atiable ambition. His victories, however, had one good effect. They &s;erved to &s;hew in how high a degree the arts of peace can promote tho&s;e of war. In this picture we becold a combination of petty &s;tates, by the arts of refinement, growing more than a match for the re&s;t of the world united; and leaving mankind an example of the &s;uperiority of intellect over brutal force. Alexander left one &s;on behind him; he was named Hercules, and was born
<PB N="276" REF="282">
of Bar&s;ine, the daughter of Artabazus, and widow of Memnon. Both Roxana and Statira are &s;aid to have been pregnant at the time of his death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. TRANSACTIONS IN GREECE, FROM THE DE|STRUCTION OF THEBES TO THE DEATH OF ANTIPATER.</HEAD>
<P>WE now return to the affairs of Greece, with which Alexander's expedition is, in a great mea&s;ure, unconnected; and hardly, indeed, bears any other relation to them, than that it was carried on by Grecian forces. When the general conven|tion of the States of Greece declared Alexander their generali&s;&s;imo again&s;t the Per&s;ians, the Lacedae|monians were the only people that refu&s;ed to concur in this appointment. With a &s;agacity and penetra|tion, which did them honour, they plainly fore&s;aw, that if that prince &s;hould &s;ucceed in his ambitious &s;cheme of &s;ubduing the Ea&s;t, it would not be long before he put a period to the &s;mall remains of Gre|cian liberty. They therefore did every thing in their power to counteract his views; they even entered into an alliance, for this purpo&s;e, with the Per&s;ian monarch; and Agis, at that time their king, a brave, active, and enterpri&s;ing prince, &s;on to Archidamus, and grand&s;on of the renowned Age&s;ilaus, exerted him&s;elf &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly upon this occa&s;ion, that he actually brought over a good number of the other &s;tates of Greece to join in the confederacy again&s;t Macedon. By this means he was enabled to rai&s;e an army of twenty thou&s;and foot and two thou&s;and hor&s;e, with which he attacked Megalopolis, the only city in Peloponne&s;us that had acknowledged Alexander for its &s;overeign. Anti|pater,
<PB N="277" REF="283">
Alexander's viceroy in Macedon, was not long in meeting him, and that too with an army amounting to above double the number. Agis, however, did not endeavour to avoid the conte&s;t; a general action en&s;ued; and though the Macedo|nians gained the victory, yet was it with the lo&s;s of three thou&s;and five hundred of their be&s;t troops. The &s;ame number fell on the other &s;ide, and, among, the re&s;t, Agis, the Spartan king, one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious characters to be found in antiquity. His end was as glorious as his life had been virtuous. Having received &s;everal wounds in the cour&s;e of the action, his &s;oldiers endeavoured, when the rout be|came general, to carry him off on their &s;houlders; but Agis &s;eeing they were in danger of being &s;ur|rounded, commanded them to &s;et him down, and pre&s;erve them&s;elves by flight for the future &s;ervice of their country. They did &s;o: he was accordingly left alone; and on his knees he fought and killed &s;everal of the Macedonians, whom he continued to engage till he was run through the body with a dart.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;equent reigns of the Spartan kings were productive of few events that are worthy of notice. Eudemidas, the &s;on of Agis, &s;ucceeded him on the throne; and happily, at lea&s;t for the tranquillity of his country, his mind was as much turned to the arts of peace, as his father's had been to tho&s;e of war. While the whole nation was burning with re&s;entment at the lo&s;s of Agis, and calling out for a renewal of ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Macedonians, in order to revenge it, Eudemidas alone re&s;trained their military ardour. And when a certain citi|zen a&s;ked him, why he &s;hould recommend the continuance of peace, when all his &s;ubjects were for war, <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e," replied the king, "I wi&s;h to convince them, that what they de&s;ire would be in|jurious to them."</Q> When another of his &s;ubjects
<PB N="278" REF="284">
was magnifying, in his pre&s;ence, the victories which their ance&s;tors had won from the Per&s;ians, and was, from thence, drawing arguments for recommencing ho&s;tilities again&s;t Macedon, <Q REND="inline">"You perhaps, think," &s;aid Eudemidas, "that it is the &s;ame thing to make war again&s;t a thou&s;and &s;heep, as again&s;t fifty wolves."</Q> Going one day, by chance, into the &s;chool of Xe|nocrates the philo&s;opher, and ob&s;erving that he was very old, he a&s;ked tho&s;e who &s;tood next to him, what was the old man's profe&s;&s;ion. Upon being an|&s;wered, that he was a wi&s;e man, who &s;ought after virtue, <Q REND="inline">"Alas," &s;aid he, "is he &s;eeking it at the&s;e years! When, then, will he make u&s;e of it?"</Q> And when, as we &s;hall &s;ee afterwards, Alexander cau&s;ed the return of all the Greek exiles, tho&s;e of Thebes excepted, to be proclaimed at the Olympic games; <Q REND="inline">"'Tis a hard ca&s;e, O ye Thebans," &s;aid Eude|midas, "but, at the &s;ame time, very honourable; for it is evident, that, of all the Greeks, Alexander fears you only."</Q></P>
<P>Antipater having &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h in cru&s;hing the in&s;urrection in Peloponne&s;us, and having cut off Agis, who was the chief author of that in&s;urrection, re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to take out of the way every other per&s;on that was likely to di&s;pute his ma&s;ter's authority; and the fir&s;t he pitched upon with this view was the celebrated Demo&s;thenes, whom he contrived to bring under a &s;u&s;picion of having proved fal&s;e to the intere&s;ts of his country. For though Harpalus, as we have already ob&s;erved, could not corrupt Phocion, he is &s;aid to have been more &s;uc|ce&s;sful with Demo&s;thenes, who was now accu&s;ed of having accepted a bribe of a golden cup and twenty talents. Certain it is, that when he was to have given his opinion with regard to the propriety of granting protection to a Macedonian culprit, he appeared with his throat bound round with &s;everal rollers. This was probably owing to a real cold he
<PB N="279" REF="285">
had caught, though his enemies alledged it was only a pretended one; and a wit ob&s;erved on the occa&s;ion, <Q REND="inline">"that the orator had got a golden quin&s;ey."</Q> Be this as it will, he was tried for bribery in the court of Areopagus; and being found guilty, was con|demned in a fine of fifty talents: and as this was a &s;um he was unable to pay, he was therefore obliged to go into bani&s;hment. But from this charge of bribery and corruption Demo&s;thenes is fully vindi|cated both by Plutarch and Pau&s;anias, two of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authors of antiquity.</P>
<P>Antipater having now rid him&s;elf of almo&s;t the only man in Greece that dared to que&s;tion his ma&s;ter's authority, Alexander re&s;olved to try how far the minds of the people were prepared to &s;ubmit to that yoke of &s;lavery which he was determined to impo&s;e upon them. With this view he cau&s;ed it to be proclaimed at the Olympic games, <Q REND="inline">"That all the Grecian exiles (tho&s;e only excepted who had been guilty of atrocious crimes) &s;hould be forthwith re&s;tored to their re&s;pective cities; and that tho&s;e cities which &s;hould refu&s;e to admit them, &s;hould be compelled to it by force of arms."</Q> This &s;tep, how|ever, &s;eems to have been rather premature. Cowed is the minds of the people were by the repeated acts of oppre&s;&s;ion they had &s;uffered, they were not yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">po&s;ed to comply with an order, which was a direct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ver&s;ion not only of all free, but of all regular go|vernment. They therefore began to make prepara|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons for a bold and vigorous re&s;i&s;tance; and being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded by Leo&s;thenes, the Athenian, who had al|ready collected a good body of his countrymen, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n found them&s;elves &s;ufficiently &s;trong to &s;et Antipater at defiance.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ituation of affairs in Greece, when the news of Alexander's death reached that country; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ws which added greatly to the &s;pirit and activity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the in&s;urgents. It was at this time too, that
<PB N="280" REF="286">
Demo&s;thenes was recalled from bani&s;hment, as his eloquence and patrioti&s;m would be of the greate&s;t &s;ervice in uniting the different &s;tates of Greece in a general confederacy again&s;t the Macedonians. He was chiefly oppo&s;ed, on this occa&s;ion by Pytheas, a creature of Alexander's. <Q REND="inline">"The Athenians," &s;aid Pytheas, "may be likened unto a&s;s's milk, which is a certain indication of &s;ickne&s;s being in any hou&s;e into which it is brought; for when they appear in any city, we may with certainty pronounce that city to be di&s;tempered."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"True," an&s;wered De|mo&s;thenes, "but as a&s;s's milk is a re&s;torative of health, &s;o are Athenian coun&s;els of di&s;tempered &s;tates."</Q></P>
<P>Antipater, though greatly inferior to the con|federates in number, had the courage to give them battle; but being defeated, he took refuge in La|mia a city of The&s;&s;aly, where he re&s;olved to hold out till a reinforcement &s;hould arrive. The Athenians were &s;o elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, that &s;ome of them propo&s;ed declaring war in form again&s;t the Macedonians; but from this they were di&s;&s;uaded by Phocion, who well knew their inability to main|tain &s;uch a conte&s;t. <Q REND="inline">"When do you think," &s;aid one of the principal citizens to him, "will be the mo&s;t proper time for going to war?"</Q> <Q REND="inline">"When the young men," replied he, "keep within the bounds of regularity; when the rich are liberal in their donations; and the orators cea&s;e to rob the &s;tate."</Q></P>
<P>It was not long before Antipater received the &s;upply of troops he expected; and now thinking him&s;elf more than a match for the enemy, he &s;et out in que&s;t of them, and coming up with them in the neighbourhood of Cranon, a city of The&s;&s;aly, he there gave them a complete overthrow. En|raged, as he was, at the Athenians, more than at any of the other &s;tates of Greece, on account of their having been the original authors, and chief con|ductors
<PB N="281" REF="287">
of this in&s;urrection, he refu&s;ed to grant them peace upon any other terms than their deliver|ing up Demo&s;thenes, and receiving into their city a Macedonian garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Demo&s;thenes, well knowing that he had incurred the re&s;entment of Antipater beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of forgivene&s;s, fled immediately to Calauria, a &s;mall i&s;land in the neighbourhood, and there took refuge in the temple of Neptune. He was followed thither by Archias, a player, whom Antipater &s;ent after him, in order to bring him back. Archias u&s;ed every argument he could think of to per&s;uade him to return, telling him that Antipater would treat him humanely. But Demo&s;thenes, who knew better than Archias, what were the di&s;po&s;i|tions of Antipater, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"O, Archias, I was never much moved with you as a player, and now I am as little moved with you as a negociator."</Q> When Archias began to pre&s;s him hard, he begged leave to withdraw a little farther into the temple, in order to write a few lines to his family. When he had got to the place where he was to write, he put a poi&s;oned quill into his mouth, and chewed it, as he u&s;ually did other quills, when he was very thoughtful. The poi&s;on beginning to operate, he turned towards the tragedian, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Now, &s;ir, you may act the part of Creon, in the tragedy, and ca&s;t out this body of mine unburried."</Q> He de|&s;ired to be &s;upported to the door of the temple, that he might not pollute it by his death; but as he pa&s;&s;ed by the altar he expired.</P>
<P>By the death of this great man, and that of Agis, Antipater e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority in Athens, and in mo&s;t of the other &s;tates, upon a firm foundation; and even &s;o far gained upon the affections of the people, by the mild u&s;e he made of his power, that he re|ceived from them the honourable appellation of. The father and protector of Greece. With the
<PB N="282" REF="288">
Aetolians, however, he was not equally &s;ucce&s;sful. That people were &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied with the terms granted them at the late pacification, that they were determined either to obtain better, or to ri&s;k every thing in the field. With this view they rai&s;ed a large army, with which they invaded the territories of Macedon; but though they gained at fir&s;t &s;ome petty advantages (e&s;pecially during Antipater's ab&s;ence in A&s;ia, whither he had been obliged to go in order to counteract the de&s;igns of Perdiccas, who was plan|ning an in&s;urrection in that part of the world) yet were they finally defeated, and compelled to &s;ubmit to their former ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Even the Athenians, though le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed, than any of the other &s;tates of Greece, with the conduct of Antipater, yet felt their pride hurt at their city's being defended by a Macedonian garri&s;on; and they therefore wi&s;hed to free them&s;elves from this badge of &s;lavery. They fir&s;t entreated Phocion to u&s;e his good offices with Antipater for this purpo&s;e; but that patriot declined the commi&s;&s;ion, well knowing that his countrymen were now become too effeminate to be left entirely to their own protec|tion. They therefore deputed the orator Demades, to wait upon Antipater, and &s;olicit the recal of the garri&s;on. This is the &s;ame Demades we have al|ready mentioned as the enemy of Demo&s;thenes. He was a man of &s;ome abilities, but of more vanity, and of a mo&s;t venal di&s;po&s;ition. Antipater u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he had two friends at Athens; Phocion, who would never accept of any reward for his &s;er|vices; and Demades, who never thought he had received enough. Whether Antipater had di&s;con|tinued his large&s;&s;es to Demades, or whether De|mades expected to be more liberally rewarded by Perdiccas, we cannot &s;ay; but he had entered into a corre&s;pondence with that commander, and had recommended to him to come over, and a&s;&s;ume the
<PB N="283" REF="289">
government of Macedon and Greece. A letter of his to Perdiccas was found, in which were the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"Come, and be the &s;upport of Macedon and Greece, which, at pre&s;ent, lean on an old rotten &s;taff,"</Q> meaning Antipater. This di&s;covery was made at the very time that he and his &s;on were en|deavouring to obtain the recal of the garri&s;on. Antipater immediately cau&s;ed the &s;on of Demades to be &s;lain in his father's pre&s;ence; and the moment he had expired, the father him&s;elf underwent the &s;ame fate.</P>
<P>Antipater did not long &s;urvive this incident. He had how attained to a great age; and the anxiety of his mind, co-operating with an enfeebled and declining habit of body, at la&s;t produced a violent di&s;ea&s;e, that &s;oon left him but little room to hope for a recovery. His end was not unworthy of the high character he had maintained through life. Preferring, as he had always done, the intere&s;t of the nation at large to that of his own family, he contented him&s;elf with appointing his &s;on, Ca&s;&s;ander, to be merely a chiliarch, or commander of a thou|&s;and men, while he left the goverment of Mace|don and Greece to Polyperchon, the elde&s;t of Alexander's captains at that time in Europe. This noble and di&s;intere&s;ted act rai&s;ed him &s;till higher, if po&s;&s;ible, in the opinion of his countrymen, and made them con&s;ider his death, which happened &s;oon after, not only as a national, but almo&s;t as an irreparable lo&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. TRANSACTIONS IN ASIA FROM THE DEATH OF ALEXANDER, TO THE DEATH OF ANTI|GONUS.</HEAD>
<P>THE expre&s;&s;ion which Alexander made u&s;e of on his death-bed, of leaving his empire <Q REND="inline">"To the mo&s;t worthy,"</Q> would probably have produced a war among his principal officers, each of whom thought him&s;elf the mo&s;t de&s;erving, had it not been, that, happily for the country, the ambition of every one of them was re&s;trained by the no le&s;s ardent ambition of the re&s;t. All of them, therefore, being thus obliged to relinqui&s;h for them&s;elves every pre|ten&s;ion to the crown, they placed it, and that too with general con&s;ent, on the head of Alexander's only brother, who was named Aridaeus, or more com|monly Philip Aridaeus. This was a prince of very weak intellects; indeed he is &s;aid to have been ab|&s;olutely in&s;ane: and to this circum&s;tance probably, more than to his being the &s;on of Philip, did he owe his ready admi&s;&s;ion to the throne.</P>
<P>As to Hercules, the &s;on of Alexander by Bar&s;ine, his right was ea&s;ily &s;et a&s;ide, as his mother was not of royal extraction. A &s;hare, however, of the &s;upreme power was re&s;erved for the child, with which Roxana was then big, &s;hould it prove a boy; and as it actually did &s;o, and was named by its mo|ther Alexander, the empire thenceforth may be &s;aid to have had two kings in&s;tead of one. Indeed, in a little time, it might probably have had a third, as Statira, Alexander's other queen, was then pregnant; but Roxana, a cruel and ambitious wo|man, took care to obviate this inconvenience by &s;ecretly making away with Statira, as &s;he &s;oon
<PB N="285" REF="291">
after did with her &s;i&s;ter, Pary&s;atis, the widow of Hephae&s;tion.</P>
<P>Perdiccas, to whom on his death-bed, Alexander had bequeathed his royal &s;ignet, and who was &s;up|po&s;ed to be his greate&s;t favourite, after the death of Hephae&s;tion, was the chief author of the&s;e, and of every other public mea&s;ure. For though, in the outward di&s;tribution of power, he contented him|&s;elf with the humble &s;tation of captain of the hou&s;hold troops, yet was he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more real influence than any other man at court, or even than any of tho&s;e who were appointed governors of the different provinces. As to the&s;e la&s;t, they were di&s;po&s;ed of in the following manner. To Antipater and Cra|terus was a&s;&s;igned the government of Macedon and of all Greece. Ly&s;imachus was &s;et over the Cher|&s;one&s;e and Thrace. Eumenes had Paphlagonia and Cappadocia. Ptolemy had Egypt, and Antigonus Phrygia the greater, Lycia and Pamphylia.</P>
<P>Though none of Alexander's captains had been able to rai&s;e them&s;elves to &s;overeign &s;way, yet were they, mo&s;t of them, by far too powerful to continue long as peaceable &s;ubjects. In a little time, ac|cordingly, a civil war broke out, and it then ap|peared that there were no le&s;s than three parties in the empire. One of the&s;e was headed by Perdiccas, and &s;upported by Eumenes; another was headed by Ptolemy, and &s;upported by Antipater and Craterus; and the third, which ultimately proved the mo&s;t formidable of all, was rai&s;ed and maintained by Antigonus alone. The events, produced by the violent contentions of the&s;e different parties, the narrow limits, to which we are confined, will not allow us to relate at any length: nor indeed, were we to do &s;o, would the detail, after all, be very intere&s;ting. Let it, therefore, &s;uffice to lay before the reader the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="292">Perdiccas marched into Egypt with a large army, in order to cru&s;h the in&s;urrection of Ptolemy, but was there &s;lain by his own &s;oldiers. Antipater likewi&s;e a&s;&s;embled an army; and having divided it into two bodies, he put one of them under the com|mand of Craterus, who had orders to watch the motions of Eumenes, whil&s;t him&s;elf, with the other, went over to Cilicia, for the purpo&s;e of giving a&s;|&s;i&s;tance to Ptolemy, in ca&s;e there &s;hould be need. In his ab&s;ence, Eumenes, &s;eizing a favourable op|portunity, attacked Craterus, who was not only de|feated, but lo&s;t his life in the action. For this lo&s;s, however, Antipater, found &s;ome con&s;olation in being unamimou&s;ly cho&s;en protector of the kings, in the room of Perdiccas. This la&s;t appointment made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to revi&s;it Macedon, and he therefore left the pro&s;ecution of the war again&s;t Eumenes to Antigonus, and to his &s;on Ca&s;&s;ander, whom he privately in&s;tructed to keep a watchful eye on the proceedings of the former, as he well knew his bold and enterprizing character.</P>
<P>Antigonus, though an excellent &s;oldier, had to cope with a man, who was but little, if at all his inferior. A battle en&s;ued between him and Eu|menes; and though the latter was wor&s;ted, chiefly through the treachery of his officers, yet had he the addre&s;s to retire with a handful of men to the ca&s;tle of Nora, where, without any other provi&s;ions than corn, &s;alt, and water, he defended him&s;elf for a whole year, and at la&s;t obliged the enemy to give over the &s;iege.</P>
<P>Antipater died &s;oon after his return to Mace|don, and, as we have already ob&s;erved, he ap|pointed Polyperchon for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. This was a weak, and vain-glorious man; and he now gave a &s;ignal proof of his imprudence in re|calling Olympias to Macedon, from which the policy of Antipater had always kept her at a di&s;|tance.
<PB N="287" REF="293">
On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, however, &s;he did not give way to tho&s;e cruel and vindictive di&s;po&s;i|tions, which had formerly marked her character, and which afterwards rendered her equally infamous and mi&s;erable; on the contrary &s;he di&s;covered the greate&s;t political &s;agacity and di&s;cernment. By her advice umenes was appointed to the chief com|mand in the ea&s;t, and was ordered to make head again&s;t Antigonus, who was every day ri&s;ing into a dangerous degree of power. Eumenes executed this commi&s;&s;ion with great ability, and even with con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. Being much inferior to An|tigonus in number of &s;oldiers, he drew over to his own party &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful officers in that general's intere&s;t, and even the whole body of the Argyra&s;pidae, a &s;et of hardy Macedonian veterans, who derived their name from the &s;ilver &s;hields which they wore, and with which they had been pre&s;ented by Alexander the Great on account of their extra|ordinary valour. By the&s;e and various other means he contrived to thwart all the de&s;igns of Antigonus for the &s;pace of three years, till at la&s;t the other, &s;eizing a favourable opportunity, fell &s;uddenly upon him in his winter-quarters, and not only di&s;com|fited his forces, but took him&s;elf pri&s;oner, and in|&s;tantly put him to death.</P>
<P>Being now freed from &s;uch a formidable enemy, Antigonus began to execute tho&s;e ambitious projects, which he had long been meditating in private, but had never dared hitherto openly to avow. He fir&s;t advanced to Babylon, of which he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter, Seleucus, the governor, having fled into Egypt, and thrown him&s;elf upon the protection of Ptolemy. He next invaded the provinces of Coelo&s;yria and Phoenicia, which he compelled to &s;umbit; and having built a fleet of five hundred &s;ail in le&s;s than a twelvemonth, he attacked and reduced the city of Tyre.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="294">In the mean time, a league was formed between Ptolemy, Ly&s;imachus, Seleucus, and Ca&s;&s;ander, for checking the progre&s;s of Antigonus's arms. Ptolemy advanced with a large army to Gaza, where he attacked and defeated Demetrius, the &s;on of Antigonus, who had been left to command in his father's ab&s;ence. But Demetrius &s;oon recovered the honour he had lo&s;t, by attacking, in his turn, one of Ptolemy's generals, and giving him a com|plete overthrow. Ptolemy, however, was enabled, by his victory at Gaza, to furni&s;h Seleucus with a &s;mall body of forces, with which he returned to Babylon, and re&s;umed the government of that city, which he continued to enjoy till his death.</P>
<P>Though not only Antigonus, but even Ptolemy, Ly&s;imachus, and Ca&s;&s;ander, had for &s;ome time acted as independent princes, &s;till they affected to acknow|ledge a kind of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Alexander the young king of Macedon. But this was a mere pretence to blind the eyes of the people; and that pretence being now no longer thought nece&s;&s;ary, they all of them threw off the ma&s;k, and openly a&s;&s;umed a title to that &s;overeign power, of which they were really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Antigonus and his &s;on were pro|claimed kings of Syria; Ptolemy was declared king of Egypt; Ca&s;&s;ander, king of Macedon; and Ly&s;imachus and Seleucus took the &s;ame badge of royalty in the provinces they governed.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch re&s;tle&s;s and ambitious &s;pirits would long live in harmony and concord among them&s;elves. The Syrian kings in|vaded Egypt, of which they hoped to make a con|que&s;t; but in this they were di&s;appointed. They next turned their arms again&s;t Rhodes; but though Demetrius, who, on account of his wonderful &s;uc|ce&s;s in &s;torming cities, was called Poliorcetes, em|ployed again&s;t it the utmo&s;t efforts of his military &s;kill, yet was he obliged to abandon the enterprize.
<PB N="289" REF="295">
For this, indeed, he was furni&s;hed with a plau&s;ible pretext, in con&s;equence of an emba&s;&s;y from the Athenians, entreating him to come and free them from the oppre&s;&s;ion of Ca&s;&s;ander, who was now be|&s;ieging their city. Demetrius readily complied with their reque&s;t, and not only compelled Ca&s;&s;ander to give over the &s;iege of Athens, but even to retreat with precipitation into Macedon.</P>
<P>By this time the power of the Syrian kings was become &s;o formidable, as to threaten the indepen|dence of all the neighbouring &s;tates, and a general combination was therefore formed again&s;t them. It con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the Macedonians, Thracians, and Egyptians, who a&s;&s;embled a large body of forces, amounting, in the whole, to about &s;eventy-four thou&s;and men. The kings of Syria were not long in meeting them with a &s;till &s;uperior army, and a battle en&s;ued in the neighbourhood of Ip&s;us, a &s;mall town in Phrygia. Both &s;ides behaved with un|common gallantry; but, after a fierce and ob&s;tinate &s;truggle, the Syrians were completely defeated, and their king Antigonus left dead upon the &s;pot. Demetrius e&s;caped with about nine thou&s;and men.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. REVOLUTIONS IN MACEDON AND GREECE, FROM THE DEATH OF ANTIPATER, TO THE FINAL OVERTHROW OF THE FAMILY OF PHILIP.</HEAD>
<P>CASSANDER, as we have already ob&s;erved, had u&s;urped the throne of Macedon. The &s;teps, by which he attained to that high dignity, it may not be improper here a little more particularly to relate. Alarmed, as he ju&s;tly was, at the con|duct of Polyperchon, in recalling Olympias to court, and intru&s;ting her, not only with the care
<PB N="290" REF="296">
of the young king, but even with the direction of the public councils, he began, in concert with his friends, to adopt &s;uch mea&s;ures, as appeared to be the mo&s;t proper for &s;ecuring them&s;elves again&s;t the effects of that woman's re&s;entment; for he well knew, that &s;he bore an implacable hatred to the memory of his father, and to all that were either de&s;cended from, or had been connected with him.</P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t &s;teps, which Polyperchon took by her advice, was to i&s;&s;ue an edict, aboli&s;hing, throughout all the &s;tates of Greece, the ari&s;tocratic form of government which Antipater had revived, and re&s;toring the democratic mode, which had ex|i&s;ted a little before it. His o&s;ten&s;ible rea&s;on for embracing this mea&s;ure, was the be&s;towing upon the people a greater degree of liberty than they then enjoyed; but his real motive was the di&s;placing tho&s;e governors whom Antipater had appointed, and thereby weakening the intere&s;t of Ca&s;&s;ander. The more intelligent part of the citizens ea&s;ily &s;aw through the deceit; but the people in general were caught by it, and clamoured loudly again&s;t all tho&s;e who dared to oppo&s;e the execution of the edict, and, among others, again&s;t the virtuous Pho|cion, who fell a &s;acrifice to their prejudices on this occa&s;ion. Being brought to a trial for this pre|tended crime, he a&s;ked whether he was to be pro|ceeded again&s;t, according to the regular forms of law; and being told that he was, he replied, <Q REND="inline">"How is that po&s;&s;ible, if no hearing is to be allowed me?"</Q> Perceiving, from the violence of the popular re|&s;entment, that no opportunity of defence would be granted him, he exclaimed, <Q REND="inline">"As for my&s;elf, I confe&s;s the crime of which I am accu&s;ed, and &s;ub|mit chearfully to the &s;entence of the law; but con&s;ider, O ye Athenians, what it is that the&s;e men have done, that they &s;hould thus be involved in the &s;ame calamity with me."</Q> The people called
<PB N="291" REF="297">
out vehemently, <Q REND="inline">"They are your accomplices, and we need no farther proof of their guilt."</Q> A de|cree was then drawn up, and read, by which Pho|cion and &s;everal others were condemned to death. As they were leading this great man to the place of execution, a friend a&s;ked him if he had any commands to leave for his &s;on: <Q REND="inline">"Only this," replied he very coolly, "that he forget how ill the Athenians treated his father."</Q></P>
<P>The revenge of his enemies was not &s;atiated even with his death. They pa&s;&s;ed a decree, by which his body was bani&s;hed the Athenian territories, and a penalty was denounced again&s;t any per&s;on, who &s;hould furni&s;h fire for his funeral pile. One Cono|pion conveyed the corp&s;e a little beyond Eleu&s;ina, where he borrowed fire of a Megarian woman, and burned it. A Megarian matron, who attended on that occa&s;ion, rai&s;ed an humble monument on the &s;pot, in memory of the unfortunate orator; and having carried home his a&s;hes, which &s;he had pre|viou&s;ly collected with great care, &s;he buried them under her hearth; putting up, at the &s;ame time, this prayer to her hou&s;hold gods: <Q REND="inline">"To you, O ye deities, who protect this place, do I commit the precious remains of the mo&s;t excellent Phocion: protect them, I be&s;eech you, from every in&s;ult, and deliver them one day to be depo&s;ited in the &s;epulchre of his ance&s;tors, when the Athenians &s;hall have become wi&s;er."</Q></P>
<P>A &s;hort time only had intervened, when the prayer of the pious matron was fulfilled. The Athenians, as in former in&s;tances of a &s;imilar kind, began to abate of their fury, and to have their eyes opened to the truth. They recollected the many &s;ervices which the &s;tate had derived from the &s;upe|rior wi&s;dom of Phocion's coun&s;els: and on that recollection, they could not but wonder at the part they had acted. They decreed, for the victim of
<PB N="992" REF="298">
their rage, a &s;tatue of bra&s;s; they ordered his a&s;hes to be brought back to Athens at the public expence; and pa&s;&s;ed an act, by which all his ac|cu&s;ers were to be put to death. Agnonides, who had a capital hand in carrying on the pro&s;ecution again&s;t Phocion, was &s;eized and executed. Epicurus and Demophilus fled; but Phocion's &s;on overtook them, and revenged the death of his father.</P>
<P>Polyperchon having thus freed him&s;elf from &s;o pow|erful an opponent as Phocion, proceeded to execute his decree with unrelenting &s;everity; and whoever dared to thwart his will in this particular, was in|&s;tantly condemned to death. Olympias too, now thinking &s;he might gratify her revenge without con|troul, and without the fear of future retribution, be|gan to wreak her re&s;entment upon all tho&s;e who were either the objects of her jealou&s;ly or hatred. King Aridaeus, the &s;on of Philip by a concubine, naturally fell under this predicament. She had already deprived him of his under&s;tanding by means of a potion &s;he had given him; and &s;he now had the cruelty to deprive him of his life, and even to inflict the &s;ame puni&s;hment on his queen Eurydice, who was likewi&s;e his niece, and grand-daughter to Philip. She had, indeed, &s;ome &s;hadow of rea&s;on for proceeding to &s;uch extremities again&s;t them. They had not only di&s;approved of her return to Macedon, but even rai&s;ed an army to prevent it; but being de&s;erted by their troops, they were both taken pri&s;oners, and put in confinement. Aridaeus was &s;oon after murdered in pri&s;on by a party of Thracians, whom Olympias &s;ent thither for the purpo&s;e; and in a little time &s;he di&s;patched a me&s;|&s;enger to the queen, with a poniard, a rope, and a cup of poi&s;on, de&s;iring her to chu&s;e which &s;he plea&s;ed. This me&s;&s;age Eurydice received with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure; and after praying the gods, <Q REND="inline">"that Olympias her&s;elf might be rewarded with
<PB N="293" REF="299">
the like pre&s;ents,"</Q> &s;he took the rope, and &s;trangled her&s;elf. Cynane, her mother, had &s;ome time before been cut off by the arts of the &s;ame vindictive woman.</P>
<P>Olympias's thir&s;t of blood &s;eems not to have been quenched by the numerous murders &s;he had com|mitted. She now cau&s;ed Nicanor, the brother of Ca&s;&s;ander, to be put to death. The body of Iolas, another brother of Ca&s;&s;ander's, which had long re&s;ted in the tomb, &s;he ordered to be brought forth, and expo&s;ed on the highway; and an hundred Ma|cedonians of noble birth were &s;eized and executed, on &s;u&s;picion of having been in the intere&s;t of Ca&s;|&s;ander. She had, indeed, great rea&s;on to hate, or at lea&s;t to dread that illu&s;trious commander; but had &s;he been as cunning as &s;he was cruel, &s;he would have endeavoured to &s;often, rather than inflame his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ander, &s;en&s;ible of his utter inability to make head again&s;t her and Polyperchon by any force he could rai&s;e in Europe, had applied for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to An|tigonus in A&s;ia; and having received a &s;mall &s;upply of men from that quarter, he returned with them to Athens, where he was gladly received by Nicanor, the governor, who had oppo&s;ed the execution of Polyperchon's decree with great zeal and activity. Their forces being thus joined, gained &s;everal ad|vantages over tho&s;e of Polypherchon and Olympias: they defeated their fleet near Byzantium, and they rendered all their enterprizes by land perfectly ineffectual.</P>
<P>Ca&s;&s;ander, however, with all his good qualitites, &s;eems to have been as much tran&s;ported with the lu&s;t of power, as any of the other great men of the age; and to this he was always ready to &s;acrifice every tie of ju&s;tice, of honour, and of gratitude. Hearing that Nicanor was beginning to form a &s;e|parate intere&s;t of his own, and aimed at no le&s;s
<PB N="294" REF="300">
than the &s;overeignty of Attica, he contrived to draw him, under pretence of an interview, into an empty hou&s;e, where he had him murdered by &s;ome a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins he had prepared for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>For this barbarous act, indeed, he made the be&s;t amends in his power, by appointing, for his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, a man of a mo&s;t excellent character. This was no other than Demetrius Phalereus, the cele|brated di&s;ciple of Theophra&s;tus. Demetrius was at once a philo&s;opher, an orator, and a man of virtue. Cicero makes mention of his oratory in a very favourable manner; but then he &s;ays, he was the fir&s;t of all the Greeks who changed the bold, nervous, and re&s;i&s;tle&s;s eloquence of the earlier orators, into the mild and pathetic &s;pecies of elo|quence; which he thinks is as much inferior, in point of merit, to the former, <Q REND="inline">"as the power of the gently-gliding &s;tream, is inferior to that of the rough thundering torrent."</Q> Demetrius, however, executed his important tru&s;t with &s;o much ju&s;tice and equity, and with &s;uch an invariable attention to the happine&s;s of the people he governed, that the Athenians erected no le&s;s than three hundred &s;tatues to his honour, and many of the&s;e were eque&s;trian.</P>
<P>Matters were now tending fa&s;t towards a cri&s;is between Ca&s;&s;ander on the one hand, and Polyperchon and Olympias on the other. Ca&s;&s;ander having di|vided his army into two bodies, gave the command of the one to Callas, with orders to march again&s;t Polyperchon, who&s;e troops had been &s;eparated from tho&s;e of Olympias. With the other he him&s;elf &s;et out in pur&s;uit of that woman, who after trying vari|ous arts to &s;tir up the Macedonians in her favour, was at la&s;t obliged to take refuge in the city of Pydna, which was &s;trongly fortified. There &s;he was immediately be&s;ieged by Ca&s;&s;ander, who reduced her at length to &s;uch difficulties for want of provi&s;ions, that &s;he
<PB N="295" REF="301">
was forced to &s;urrender both her&s;elf and her army. In taking this mortifying &s;tep, however, &s;he had the precaution to &s;tipulate for her life; but the kin|dred of tho&s;e whom &s;he had murdered, in&s;i&s;ting on her death, Ca&s;&s;ander pretended, that the &s;tipulation related only to military execution, and he therefore gave her up to the civil laws of her country. The friends of tho&s;e whom &s;he had &s;lain, a&s;&s;embled, and accu&s;ed her before the people, by whom &s;he was condemned without being heard. On this occa&s;ion Ca&s;&s;ander offered her a &s;hip to convey her to Athens, but &s;he rejected the offer. She in&s;i&s;ted upon being heard before the Macedonians; and &s;aid, &s;he was not afraid to an&s;wer for all &s;he had done. Ca&s;|&s;ander was unwilling to abide the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch a trial as &s;he demanded: he therefore &s;ent a band of two hundred &s;oldiers to put her to death. When the &s;oldiers entered the pri&s;on, they were &s;truck with awe at her maje&s;tic appearance, and refu&s;ed to ex|ecute their orders; but the relations of tho&s;e, who had fallen by her re&s;entment, ru&s;hed forward, and cut her throat. She is &s;aid to have behaved with much fortitude on that trying occa&s;ion. Ca&s;&s;ander &s;uffered her body to lie, for &s;ome time, unburied; to revenge, perhaps, the in&s;ult which &s;he had offered to the remains of his brother Iolas. Roxana and her &s;on (as we have already ob&s;erved) were &s;oon after murdered; and the &s;ame was the fate of Her|cules, Alexander's other &s;on whom he had by Bar&s;ine.</P>
<P>Not more than twenty-eight years had elap&s;ed &s;ince the death of that conqueror, and not a &s;ingle branch of his hou&s;e remained to enjoy a portion of the empire, which he and his father had acquired at the price of the greate&s;t policy, dangers, and blood|&s;hed. Such, to the royal family of Macedon, were the effects of that ambition, which had lighted up the flames of war in Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. REVOLUTIONS IN MACEDON AND GREECE, FROM THE OVERTHROW OF THE FAMILY OF PHI|LIP, TO THE CONFEDERACY FORMED BY THE MACEDONIANS AND ACHAEANS AGAINST THE AETCLIANS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Ca&s;&s;ander had now e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf on the throne of Macedon, he did not enjoy all that tranquillity which he thought he had rea&s;on to expect. He found that Polyperchon and his &s;on Alexander were forming a party again&s;t him in Greece; and therefore, in order to counteract their de&s;igns, he marched into Boeotia, where he not only defeated all their machinations, but likewi&s;e rebuilt the city of Thebes, about twenty years after it had been de&s;troyed by Alexander the Great. This tran&s;action he did not long &s;urvive. He died in a little time after, leaving behind him two &s;ons, Antipater and Alexander, who, as u&s;ually happens in &s;uch ca&s;es, &s;oon began to quarrel about their re&s;pective right to the throne; and the latter calling in the aid of Demetrius Poliorcetes, this la&s;t con|trived to make away with the man he pretended to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and him&s;elf got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;overeign power. Of this, however, he was &s;oon deprived by the joint efforts of Ly&s;imachus, and Pyrrhus, king of Epire; the former of whom, partly by open force, and partly by &s;ecret artifices, found means to make him&s;elf &s;ole king of Macedon. But neither did he enjoy his newly acquired power for any length of time, his army being routed, and him&s;elf &s;lain, in a great battle, which he fought with Seleucus, king of Babylon. Seleucus, upon this victory&punc; re&s;igned his A&s;iatic dominions to his
<PB N="297" REF="303">
&s;on Antiochus, and came over to Macedon, in the fond hope of pa&s;&s;ing the remainder of his days in the quiet enjoyment of his native country. But he was treacherou&s;ly murdered, about &s;even months after, by Ptolemy Ceraunus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Thunderer.</NOTE>, the brother of Ca&s;|&s;ander; who, to add to his guilt, prevailed upon the widow of Ly&s;imachus to marry him; but he had no &s;ooner got her and her children into his power, than he put the young princes to death, and bani&s;hed the mother into Samothrace.</P>
<P>Crimes &s;o atrocious did not long go unpuni&s;hed. His kingdom (for he had now &s;eized on the throne of Macedon) was &s;oon over-run by a body of Gauls, who &s;uddenly attacked and defeated her forces, and having cut off the head of the king him&s;elf, they fixed it to the end of a long pole, and thus carried it in triumph through their ranks.</P>
<P>The progre&s;s, however, of the&s;e barbarians was at la&s;t put a &s;top to by the united &s;tates of Greece. They &s;everal times attempted to force the &s;traits of Thermopylae, but were always repul&s;ed with con|&s;iderable lo&s;s. At length they found a pa&s;&s;age into the interior parts of Greece by the way of mount Oeta, and directed their march towards the temple of Delphi, which they intended to plunder. But the inhabitants of that &s;acred city, in&s;pired by re|ligious enthu&s;ia&s;m, made a de&s;perate &s;ally upon the barbarians, who, &s;truck with a panic, fled with pre|cipitation. The pur&s;uit was continued for a whole day and night; and a violent &s;torm and piercing cold co-operating with the fury of the victorious Greeks, mo&s;t of the enemy peri&s;hed either by the &s;word or the &s;everity of the weather. Brennus, their leader, unable to bear the &s;mart of the wounds he had received, and di&s;tracted at the &s;ame time with religious horror, put an end to his own life. The few that &s;urvived, having a&s;&s;embled together,
<PB N="298" REF="304">
endeavoured to effect a retreat from &s;o fatal a country. But the different nations ro&s;e upon them as they pa&s;&s;ed; and of all tho&s;e multitudes, which had poured out of Macedon into Greece, not one returned to his native land. Ju&s;tin &s;ays they were all cut off; though other hi&s;torians alledge, that a remnant of them made their e&s;cape into Thrace and A&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Delphians did not depend entirely on their courage in repelling the barbarians; they employed two very ingenious and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tratagems again&s;t them. They procured an order from the oracle, commanding the inhabitants of the adjacent villages to abandon their dwellings, and to leave them well &s;tored with wines and all kinds of provi&s;ions. The con&s;equence was, that the Gauls, who, like all other barbarians, were naturally voracious, and had their appetites &s;harpened by a long want of &s;u&s;tenance, fell ravenou&s;ly upon the&s;e dainties, and thus through intemperance lo&s;t much of that vigour, which had hitherto been the principal cau&s;e of the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms. The other &s;tratagem was this; mount Parna&s;&s;us, which &s;tood clo&s;e by the city of Delphos, was furni&s;hed with many caves and hollow wind|ings. In the&s;e numbers of people were &s;tationed, with in&s;tructions, on proper occa&s;ions, to &s;et up loud &s;houts, and to make the mo&s;t frightful yellings and &s;creams. The&s;e i&s;&s;uing forth without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e filled the barbarians with terror, as if they proceeded from &s;omething more than human; and therefore believing they were warring with &s;uperior beings, not with men, they betook them&s;elves to a pre|cipitate retreat, even almo&s;t before they were attack|ed. This body of Gauls formed only a part of that immen&s;e &s;hoal, which to the number, it is &s;aid, of no le&s;s than three hundred thou&s;and, poured out of their own country in que&s;t of new &s;ettlements; and though they were defeated and cut off in Greece,
<PB N="299" REF="305">
yet they had the courage to take and plunder Rome.</P>
<P>The Macedonian throne, after the death of Pto|lemy Ceraunus, was filled by Antigonus, the &s;on of Demetrius Poliorcetes; he was depo&s;ed and &s;ucceeded Pyrrhus, king of Epire: but, upon the death of this la&s;t prince, Antigonus once more a&s;&s;umed the &s;ove|reign &s;way. Nothing remarkable happened during the reign of either of the&s;e kings, except that Pyrrhus, the mo&s;t warlike prince of his time, and, in the opinion of Hannibal, the greate&s;t general that ever lived, made an attempt upon the liberty of Sparta; and advancing to the gates of the city with a powerful army, the inhabitants were &s;truck with &s;o much terror, that they propo&s;ed &s;ending off their women to a place of &s;afety. But Archidamia who was delegated by the Spartan ladies, entered the &s;enate-hou&s;e with a &s;word in her hand, and de|livered their &s;entiments and her own in the&s;e words: <Q REND="inline">"Think not, O men of Sparta! &s;o meanly of your country-women, as to imagine that we will &s;urvive the ruin of the &s;tate. Deliberate not then whither we are to fly, but what we are to do."</Q> In con&s;equence of this, the whole body of citizens exerted them&s;elves with &s;uch undaunted courage, that they repul&s;ed Pyrrhus in all his at|tempts to de&s;troy the city. They even pur&s;ued him in his retreat, and &s;lew Ptolemy his &s;on, who was bringing up the rear of his army. Pyrrhus him&s;elf &s;oon after peri&s;hed in a like attempt upon Argos.</P>
<P>Antigonus, upon his re-a&s;cending the throne, defeated a body of Gauls, who had made a fre&s;h ir|ruption into Macedon; and encouraged by this &s;uc|ce&s;s, he began to entertain thoughts of making him&s;elf ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of Greece. He even pro|ceeded &s;o far, as to compel the Athenians to re|ceive a Macedonian garri&s;on; and he would pro|bably
<PB N="300" REF="306">
have impo&s;ed the &s;ame badge of &s;lavery on the other &s;tates of Greece, had not death put an end to all his ambitious projects. He was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on Demetrius, and this la&s;t by his kin&s;man Antigonus, neither of who&s;e reigns were di&s;|tingui&s;hed by any remarkable events.</P>
<P>About this time the republic of Achaia began to make a capital figure, and bade fair for re&s;toring that &s;pirit of liberty in Greece, which had in a great mea&s;ure been extingui&s;hed, partly by the di&s;|&s;en&s;ions of the different &s;tates among them&s;elves, but chiefly by the encroachments of the Macedo|nian monarchs. This republic con&s;i&s;ted originally of twelve towns, that were a&s;&s;ociated together for their mutual defence. They had the &s;ame friend|&s;hips and the &s;ame enmities; the &s;ame coins, weights and mea&s;ures; the &s;ame laws, and the &s;ame magi&s;|trates. The&s;e magi&s;trates were elected annually, by a majority of voices throughout the whole com|munity. Twice in the year, or oftener if nece&s;&s;ary, a general a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of deputies from the different cities, was held for the great purpo&s;es of legi&s;lation and government. The magi&s;trates, who were inve&s;ted with the &s;upreme executive power, were &s;tyled generals of the &s;tates of Achaia. They commanded the military force of the republic, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right of pre&s;iding in the national a&s;|&s;embly. Their number was originally two; but from the inconveniencies attendant on a divided government, was at la&s;t reduced to one. A council of ten, called Demiurgi, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the general with their advice, and examined all matters intended to be brought before the national a&s;&s;embly, and pro|po&s;ed or rejected them at plea&s;ure. The power of the Demiurgi, in this la&s;t re&s;pect, was exactly the &s;ame as that of the lords of articles in the ancient government of Scotland. Be&s;ides the&s;e &s;uperior magi&s;trates, every town had al&s;o its municipal ma|gi&s;tracy,
<PB N="301" REF="307">
con&s;i&s;ting al&s;o, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, like the national con&s;titution, of a popular a&s;&s;embly, a council, and a pre&s;iding magi&s;trate. With re|&s;pect to the laws of the Achaeans, the mo&s;t material object in the hi&s;tory of any people, our knowledge is extremely imperfect. Such of them, however, as have come down to us, are proofs of their political wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>It was enacted, that whatever individual or town, belonging to the Achaean confederacy, &s;hould ac|cept of any gratification what&s;oever, in its public or private capacity, from prince or people, &s;hould be cut off from the commonwealth of Achaia: that no member of the Achaean league &s;hould &s;end any emba&s;&s;y, or contract any alliance or friend&s;hip with any prince or people, without the privity and approbation of the whole Achaean confederacy. The unanimous con&s;ent of the whole confederacy was nece&s;&s;ary for the admi&s;&s;ion into it of any prince, &s;tate, or city. A convention of the national a&s;|&s;embly was not to be granted at the reque&s;t of any foreign prince, unle&s;s the matters to be offered to their con&s;ideration were fir&s;t delivered, in writing, to the general of Achaia, and the council of ten, and pronounced by them to be of &s;ufficient impor|tance. The deliberations of every a&s;&s;embly were to be wholly confined to the matters on account of which they had been convened. In all debates, tho&s;e who &s;poke were to deliver a &s;hort &s;ketch of the arguments they employed, in order to their be|ing con&s;idered the en&s;uing day; and within three days, at farthe&s;t, was the bu&s;ine&s;s before them to be finally determined.</P>
<P>The general tendency of the Achaean league was &s;o favourable to the liberties of mankind, that mo&s;t of the neighbouring &s;tates a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves with it; but when the power of Macedon became para|mount to that of all Greece, many of the mem|bers
<PB N="302" REF="308">
de&s;erted the confederacy, and fell under the dominion of various tyrants. From this &s;tate of &s;lavery, however, they were, in a little time, freed by the &s;pirit and activity of Aratus, a native of Si|cyon, who having fir&s;t delivered his own country from the tyranny of Nicocles, its &s;overeign, and being in con&s;equence of this cho&s;en general of Achaia, proceeded to attack one petty tyrant after another, till at la&s;t he re-e&s;tabli&s;hed all the &s;tates of Greece in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ancient freedom. But this happy &s;ituation of affairs was not of long continuance: it was &s;oon overturned by the jealou&s;y and ambition of tho&s;e very parties, from who&s;e love of liberty it had originally &s;prung.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. FROM THE CONFEDERACY BETWEEN THE AETO|LIANS AND SPARTANS AGAINST THE ACHAE|ANS, TO THE INVASION OF GREECE BY ANTI|OCHUS KING OF SYRIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Aetolians were the fir&s;t that began to look, with a jealous eye, on the &s;uperiority of the Achaeans over the other &s;tates of Greece; and they laboured, and that with but too much &s;ucce&s;s, to in|fu&s;e the like prejudices into the Spartans. The man|ners of this la&s;t people were now totally altered. They had exchanged poverty and hardy di&s;cipline for opulence and a luxurious &s;tile of living. The lands, which were formerly divided, in equal por|tions, among the whole body of the people, were now engro&s;&s;ed by a few families, who lived in the greate&s;t &s;plendour and magnificence, while the re&s;t of the citizens were plunged in the utmo&s;t poverty and di&s;tre&s;s. Agis, one of their mo&s;t virtuous
<PB N="303" REF="309">
kings, was put to death, for attempting to re&s;tore the agrarian and &s;umptuary laws of Lycurgus. Cleo|menes, however, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, was more fortunate. He actually did re&s;tore the&s;e laws, though not till he had acquired &s;ufficient popularity to &s;et all op|po&s;ition at defiance. This popularity he owed chiefly to the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms again&s;t the Achaeans and their allies, &s;everal of who&s;e towns he attacked and &s;ubdued; and he even defeated their army in two pitched battles, the one at Leuctra, and the other at Hecatombaeum.</P>
<P>Aratus, provoked at the conduct of Cleomenes in thus making war upon the Achaeans without any vi&s;ible cau&s;e, threw him&s;elf on the protection of Antigonus, king of Macedon; and in order to induce him to grant the aid he reque&s;ted, he en|tered into a compact with that monarch, the con|ditions of which were: That the citadel of Corinth &s;hould be delivered into the hands of the king; that he &s;hould be at the head of the Achaean confederacy, &s;uperintend their councils, and direct their opera|tions; that his army &s;hould be &s;upported at their expence; that neither emba&s;&s;y nor letter &s;hould be &s;ent to any power without his approbation; and that no city, &s;tate, or people, &s;hould be, from that time, admitted into the Achaean league without his con&s;ent. From the&s;e articles it is evident, that the liberties of Achaia were now no more, and that the real &s;overeign of that country was Antigonus.</P>
<P>The conduct of Aratus in making this treaty, was more unpopular than that of Cleomenes in attack|ing the Achaeans: the con&s;equence was, that mo&s;t of the &s;tates of Greece abandoned the cau&s;e of the former, and e&s;pou&s;ed that of the latter, whom they now con&s;idered as the only protector of their liberties. But Antigonus, be&s;ides being an excel|lent general, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater re&s;ources than any Cleomenes could command; and thus having
<PB N="304" REF="310">
contrived, after various manoeuvres, to bring him to an engagement, he not only gave him a complete overthrow, but compelled him to fly into Egypt, where being &s;u&s;pected of forming de|&s;igns again&s;t the government, he was cruelly put to death.</P>
<P>Antigonus him&s;elf died &s;oon after, and was &s;uc|ceeded by Philip, the &s;on of Demetrius, the la&s;t of the Macedonian kings of that name. This prince, treading in the &s;teps of his predece&s;&s;or, re&s;olved to give effectual aid to the Achaeans; which he accordingly did, by carrying the war into Aetolia it&s;elf, and reducing a great number of its &s;trong holds. Though naturally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great mo|deration, he now began to entertain the hope of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of all Greece, by forming a junction with Hannibal, who was then carrying on war again&s;t the Romans. He &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Carthaginian general, and a treaty was con|cluded between them, importing that Philip &s;hould furni&s;h a fleet and army, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Hannibal in making a conque&s;t of Italy; after which, Hannibal &s;hould pa&s;s into Epire, and having completed the reduc|tion of the whole country, &s;hould yield up to Philip &s;uch places as lay convenient for Macedon. Philip performed his part of the agreement. He entered the Ionian gulf with a large fleet, and took Oricum, a &s;ea-port on the coa&s;t of Epire; but being &s;ur|prized and defeated by the Romans, he was obliged to return di&s;gracefully into his own country.</P>
<P>The Romans had their hands too full of the war with Hannibal, to think of carrying their arms into Macedon; but they took care to find employ|ment for Philip, by encouraging his enemies in Greece to attack him. For this purpo&s;e they entered into a treaty with the Aetolians, of which the following were the principal conditions: That the Aetolians &s;hould immediately commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t
<PB N="305" REF="311">
Philip by land, which the Romans were to &s;up|port by a fleet of twenty gallies; that whatever conque&s;ts might be made, from the confines of Aetolia to Corcyra, the cities, buildings, and ter|ritory &s;hould belong to the Aetolians, but every other kind of plunder to the Romans. The Spar|tans and Eleans, with other &s;tates, were included in this alliance; and the war commenced with the reduction of the i&s;land of Zacynthus, which, as an earne&s;t of Roman genero&s;ity and good faith, was immediately annexed to the dominions of Aetolia. The&s;e things happened about two hundred and eight years before the birth of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The Romans having thus obtained a footing in Greece, &s;oon extended and e&s;tabli&s;hed their power throughout the whole of that renowned country. Agreeably to their u&s;ual policy, they availed them|&s;elves of the credulity, the di&s;&s;en&s;ions, the ambition, and the avarice of the different chiefs; ever vigilant to &s;upport the weaker again&s;t the &s;tronger party, that the dimini&s;hed &s;trength of each individual &s;tate might lead the way to the conque&s;t of the whole.</P>
<P>Mean while the war continued to be carried on between Philip and the Aetolians with equal vigour, and almo&s;t with equal &s;ucce&s;s on both &s;ides, till at la&s;t the former was obliged to return into his own kingdom, to &s;uppre&s;s a rebellion which had there broke out. The Achaeans, however, though de|prived of the aid of &s;o powerful a monarch, were &s;till able to make head again&s;t their enemies. They were now commanded by Philopaemen in the room of Aratus, whom Philip had poi&s;oned, on account of his oppo&s;ing the ambitious de&s;ign which the latter had formed of &s;ubduing all Greece. They even de|feated the armies of Aetolia and Elis in a great battle; but after the war had continued for the &s;pace of &s;ix years, it was at length terminated by a
<PB N="306" REF="312">
peace between the Romans on the one hand, and Philip on the other.</P>
<P>This peace, however, was but of &s;hort duration. For Philip having invaded the dominions of the king of Egypt, as al&s;o the territories of &s;everal of the &s;tates of Greece, complaints were brought again&s;t him, on that account, before the Roman &s;enate, who immediately di&s;patched an amba&s;&s;ador to him, &s;trictly charging him, in the name of the republic, to de&s;i&s;t from all ho&s;tilities again&s;t tho&s;e powers, and to refer the matters in di&s;pute between him and them to a fair arbitration. Marcus Aemilius, who carried this order, delivered it with all that dignity and firmne&s;s which di&s;tingui&s;hed the Roman cha|racter. <Q REND="inline">"The boa&s;tful inexperience of youth," &s;aid the king to him, "thy gracefulne&s;s of per&s;on, and &s;till more, the name of Roman, in&s;pire thee with this haughtine&s;s. It is my wi&s;h that Rome may ob&s;erve the faith of treaties; but &s;hould &s;he be in|clined again to hazard an appeal to arms, I tru&s;t, that, with the protection of the gods, I &s;hall render the Macedonian name as formidable as that of the Roman."</Q> The&s;e events happened about one hun|dred and ninety-nine years before the birth of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Philip &s;oon found, that the &s;tile of the Roman amba&s;&s;adors was not more imperious, than their power was irre&s;i&s;tible; for Titus Quintus Flaminius, be|ing appointed to command again&s;t him, reduced him, in a little time, to the hard nece&s;&s;ity of ac|cepting a peace on the following conditions: <Q REND="inline">"That all the Greek cities, both in A&s;ia and Europe, &s;hould be free, and re&s;tored to the enjoyment of their own laws: that Philip, before the next I&s;th|mian games, &s;hould deliver up to the Romans all the Greeks he had in any part of his dominions, and evacuate all the places he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed either in Greece or in A&s;ia: that he &s;hould give up all pri|&s;oners and de&s;erters: that he &s;hould &s;urrender all
<PB N="307" REF="313">
his decked &s;hips of every kind, five &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and his own galley of &s;ixteen banks of oars, excepted; that he &s;hould pay the Romans a thou&s;and talents, one half down, and the re&s;t at ten equal annual payments; and that, as a &s;ecurity for the perform|ance of the&s;e article, he &s;hould gives ho&s;tages, his &s;on Demetrius being one.</Q> This event happened an hundred and ninety-three years before Chri&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. FROM THE INVASION OF GREECE BY ANTIO|CHUS, TO THE TIME OF ITS BECOMING A ROMAN PROVINCE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Romans, by their treaty with Philip, pretended to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Greeks in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ancient freedom, yet no|thing was farther from their intention. On the contrary, they meant to reduce them under their own dominion. The que&s;tion was not whether the Greeks &s;hould be en&s;laved, but who &s;hould be their ma&s;ters; and the Romans thought, and it mu&s;t be owned with &s;ome &s;hadow of ju&s;tice, that there was no people in the world better intitled to &s;uch a di&s;|tinction than them&s;elves. They therefore &s;ought for a plau&s;ible pretext of carrying their arms a &s;econd time into Greece; and it was not long before this was afforded them by Antiochus, king of Syria. For that prince having invaded Greece, under pre|tence of &s;upporting his own rights, was oppo&s;ed by the Romans on the &s;pecious plea of defending the public liberty; and who not only defeated his forces, but compelled him to retire into his A&s;iatic domi|nions. The Aetolians, too, though they formerly co-operated with the Romans as allies, could not think of enduring them as ma&s;ters; and they
<PB N="308" REF="314">
therefore endeavoured to thwart their de&s;ign of u&s;urping the &s;overeignty of the Grecian republics; but the con&s;ul Acilius Glabrio &s;oon reduced their power to &s;o low an ebb, that they were glad to ac|cept of a peace upon any terms, and even virtually to give up their independence, by promi&s;ing to pay ob&s;ervance to the empire and maje&s;ty of the Roman people.</P>
<P>The efforts of the Achaeans to prevent the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Roman empire in Greece were not more &s;ucce&s;sful. Above a thou&s;and of their leading men were tran&s;ported to Rome, in order to an&s;wer for the pretended crime of having &s;ecretly abetted the king of Macedon, who had had the courage or temerity to oppo&s;e the Romans in the field. But that prince, who&s;e name was Per&s;eus, and who was &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Philip, was not only defeated in a great battle; but being taken pri&s;oner, was carried to Rome, and thrown into a dungeon, where he &s;tarved him&s;elf to death. His only &s;ur|viving &s;on, Alexander, became a clerk to one of the Roman magi&s;trates. Macedon was immediately formed into a Roman province, as were likewi&s;e, in a little time after, all the different &s;tates of Greece. The&s;e things fell out about an hundred and &s;ixty-three years before the birth of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>From this time forward few events of any great con|&s;equence happened in Greece, and tho&s;e that occurred belong more properly to Roman than to Grecian hi&s;tory. We &s;hall therefore pur&s;ue them no farther at pre&s;ent, but conclude with ob&s;erving, that de|pre&s;&s;ed as the Greeks now unhappily were under a foreign yoke, and con&s;equently deprived of their national character as a free and independent people, they yet retained, amid&s;t all their calamities, that &s;trength of genius and delicacy of ta&s;te, that quick|ne&s;s of invention and acutene&s;s of di&s;cernment, for which they had ever been remarkable: that they
<PB N="309" REF="315">
helped to poli&s;h their haughty and as yet but half-civilized conquerors; that, upon the de&s;truction of the we&s;tern empire, they &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated the arts and &s;ciences, while all the re&s;t of the world was &s;unk in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance and barbari&s;m; and that, upon the taking of Con&s;tantinople by the Turks, they carried tho&s;e arts and &s;ciences with them into Italy, and there paved the way for the revival of that learning, which has ever &s;ince enlightened, and &s;till continues to enlighten mankind.</P>
