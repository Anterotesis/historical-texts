<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR friend&s;hip for Dr. <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> is a &s;ufficient inducement for me to in|&s;cribe his Beauties to you. In all ages, the illu&s;trious and the learned have been courted, in the highe&s;t &s;train of panegyric, to take the offspring of Genius under their patronage. This I am prevented from doing here; for the writings from which this cento of excellence is taken, have long &s;ince found innumerable ad|mirers in every poli&s;hed &s;ociety. My &s;ole motive for addre&s;&s;ing your Lord&s;hip,

ari&s;es from your e&s;teem for the Author, who&s;e moral and &s;entimental writings have given birth to a volume every way meriting your Lord&s;hip's countenance.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is merely in compliance with cu&s;tom I &s;it down to write a Preface. Dr. <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI>'s writings need not an eulogium at this hour: they may be compared to the invaluable paint|ings of <HI>Raphael</HI>; the longer they are in the world, their e&s;timation becomes more exten|&s;ive. Time has drawn the veil of oblivion over the works of many writers, once renowned (if we may credit tradition) for every perfection that captivates. Nature was certainly wanting to enrich tho&s;e compo&s;itions. What &s;he has had a hand in, Time reverences, and a final di&s;&s;olution can only de&s;troy. How happy, then, mu&s;t the hallowed &s;pirit of <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> be, who&s;e Beauties wear the &s;imple brilliancy of Nature, and all the decorative charms of Fancy! who&s;e prai&s;e is the theme of the ingenious, from the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">London.</NOTE> Capital of Ta&s;te and Patronage, to the cot|tage of learned tranquillity, and which Time will for ever regard with parental affection!</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">The Pictures I have given from his Poems, are the highe&s;t fini&s;hed in the group; and the whole &s;election will be found, it is hoped, meriting the attention and patronage of the refined lovers of elegant and e&s;timable litera|ture.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH, <HI>M. B.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FAME, the only inflexible friend of Genius, has been &s;ingularly kind to the Author who&s;e life I with much plea&s;ure &s;it down to give &s;ome account of. She has &s;ounded the prai&s;es of her favourite to the extremities of ta&s;te and literary refinement. The Court and the Cottage &s;hare with equal felicity the invaluable fruits of his elegant &s;tudies! The &s;malle&s;t memorial is a beacon for the incautious heart of virtue and &s;implicity, or a balm for the wounded &s;oul of the comfortle&s;s! Hence the lovers of human excellence have been &s;edulous in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing our writer's reputation on the ba&s;is of immortality.</P>
<P><HI>Gold&s;mith</HI>'s biographers have been many; their opinions, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, different; but they all agree that he was a man of elevated genius, un|bounded philanthropy, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the milk of human kindne&s;s in a &s;upereminent degree. I have
<PB N="vi" REF="7">
their &s;everal accounts before me; and, upon an impartial &s;urvey, Dr. <HI>Glover</HI>'s &s;tands highe&s;t in my e&s;timation. He was <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI>'s intimate friend, a companion in many of his literary pur&s;uits, and his enthu&s;ia&s;tic admirer! What &s;uch a writer &s;ays, as far as relates to facts, mu&s;t be li&s;tened to with more plea&s;ure than a mere work of fiction, how|ever elaborate, or &s;plendidly &s;et off. It gives me plea&s;ure to acknowledge the obligations I lie under to this ingenious and excellent companion, for many particulars relative to Dr. <HI>Gold&s;mith.</HI> I &s;hall give his account entire, marked with double com|mas.</P>
<P><HI>"OLIVER GOLDSMITH</HI> was born at <HI>Ro&s;|common,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the year 1731. His father, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;mall e&s;tate in that county, had nine &s;ons, of which <HI>Oliver</HI> was the third. He was originally intended for the church; and with that view, after being well in&s;tructed in the cla&s;|&s;ics, was, with his brother the Rev. <HI>Henry Gold&s;mith,</HI> placed in <HI>Trinity</HI> college, <HI>Dublin,</HI> about the latter end of the year 1749. In this &s;eminary of learn|ing he continued a few years, when he took a Ba|chelor's degree; but his brother not being able to obtain any preferment after he left the college, <HI>Oliver,</HI> by the advice of Dean <HI>Gold&s;mith,</HI> of <HI>Cork,</HI> turned his thoughts to the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic, and, after attending &s;ome cour&s;es of anatomy in <HI>Dublin,</HI> proceeded to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the year 1751, where he &s;tudied the &s;everal branches of medicine
<PB N="vii" REF="8">
under the different Profe&s;&s;ors in that univer&s;ity, which was de&s;ervedly ranked among the fir&s;t &s;chools of phy&s;ic in <HI>Europe.</HI> His beneficent di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon involved him in unexpected difficulties, and he was obliged precipitately to leave <HI>Scotland,</HI> in con&s;equence of engaging him&s;elf to pay a con|&s;iderable &s;um of money for a fellow-&s;tudent.</P>
<P>"A few days after, about the beginning of the year 1754, he arrived at <HI>Sunderland,</HI> near <HI>New|ca&s;tle,</HI> where he was arre&s;ted at the &s;uit of one <HI>Barclay,</HI> a taylor in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to whom he had given &s;ecurity for his friend. By the good graces of <HI>Laughlin Maclane,</HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Dr. <HI>Sleigh,</HI> who were then in the college, he was &s;oon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his pa&s;|&s;age on board a <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hip to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where, after a &s;hort &s;tay, he proceeded to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els.</HI> He then vi&s;ited great part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and, after pa&s;s|ing &s;ome time at <HI>Stra&s;bourg</HI> and <HI>Lovain,</HI> where he obtained a degree of Bachelor in Phy&s;ic, he accom|panied an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gentleman to <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P>"It is undoubtedly fact, that this ingenious, unfortunate man, made mo&s;t part of his tour on foot! He had left <HI>England</HI> with very little money; and, being of a philo&s;ophical turn, and at that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a body capable of &s;u&s;taining every fatigue, and a heart not ea&s;ily terrified at danger, he became an enthu&s;ia&s;t to the de&s;ign he had formed of &s;eeing the manners of different countries. He
<PB N="viii" REF="9">
had &s;ome knowledge of the <HI>French</HI> language, and of mu&s;ic; he played tolerably well on the <HI>German</HI> flute; which, from an amu&s;ement, became at &s;ome times the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. His learn|ing produced him an ho&s;pitable reception at mo&s;t of the religious hou&s;es, and his mu&s;ic made him welcome to the pea&s;ants of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> 'Whenever I approached a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e towards night-fall,' he u&s;ed to &s;ay, 'I played one of my mo&s;t merry tunes, and that generally procured me not only a lodging, but &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the next day: but in truth,' (his con&s;tant expre&s;&s;ion) 'I mu&s;t own, whenever I attempted to entertain per&s;ons of a higher rank, they always thought my perform|ance odious, and never made me any return for my endeavours to plea&s;e them."</P>
<P>"On his arrival at <HI>Geneva,</HI> he was recom|mended as a proper per&s;on for a travelling tutor to a young man, who had been unexpectedly left a con&s;iderable &s;um of money by his uncle, Mr. <HI>S</HI>&mdash;. This youth, who was articled to an at|torney, on receipt of his fortune, determined to &s;ee the world; and, on his engaging with his pre|ceptor, made a provi&s;o, that he &s;hould be permitted to govern him&s;elf; and our traveller &s;oon found his pupil under&s;tood the art of directing in money concerns extremely well, as avarice was his pre|vailing pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="10">"During <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI>'s continuance in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> he a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given &s;ome &s;triking proofs at the college of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> It was from hence he &s;ent the fir&s;t &s;ketch of his delightful epi&s;tle, called <HI>The Traveller,</HI> to his brother, the clergyman, in <HI>Ire|land,</HI> who, giving up fame and fortune, had re|tired, with an amiable wife, to happine&s;s and ob|&s;curity, on an income of only 40l. a year.</P>
<P>"From <HI>Geneva,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> and his pupil vi&s;ited the South of <HI>France,</HI> where the young man, upon &s;ome di&s;agreement with his preceptor, paid him the &s;mall part of his &s;alary which was due, and embarked at <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> for <HI>England.</HI> Our wan|derer was left once more upon the world at large, and pa&s;&s;ed through a number of difficulties in tra|ver&s;ing the greate&s;t part of <HI>France.</HI> At length, his curio&s;ity being gratified, he bent his cour&s;e towards <HI>England,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Dover,</HI> the begin|ning of the winter, in the year 1758.</P>
<P>"His finances were &s;o low on his return to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> that he with difficulty got to this metropolis, his whole &s;tock of ca&s;h amounting to no more than a few halfpence! An entire &s;tranger in <HI>London,</HI> his mind was filled with the mo&s;t gloomy reflections, in con&s;equence of his embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation! He applied to &s;everal apothecaries, in hopes of being received in the capacity of a journeyman; but his broad <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> accent, and the uncouthne&s;s of his ap|pearance,
<PB N="x" REF="11">
occa&s;ioned him to meet with in&s;ult from mo&s;t of the medicinal tribe. The next day, how|ever, a chymi&s;t near <HI>Fi&s;h-&s;treet,</HI> &s;truck with his forlorn condition, and the &s;implicity of his man|ner, took him into his laboratory, where he con|tinued till he di&s;covered his old friend Dr. <HI>Sleigh</HI> was in <HI>London.</HI> This gentleman received him with the warme&s;t affection, and liberally invited him to &s;hare his pur&s;e till &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment could be pro|cured for him. <HI>Gold&s;mith,</HI> unwilling to be a bur|den to his friend, a &s;hort time after eagerly em|braced an offer which was made him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the late Rev. Dr. <HI>Milner,</HI> in in&s;tructing the young gen|tlemen at the academy at <HI>Peckham</HI>; and acquitted him&s;elf greatly to the Doctor's &s;atisfaction for a &s;hort time; but, having obtained &s;ome reputation by the critici&s;ms he had written in the <HI>Monthly Review,</HI> Mr. <HI>Griffiths,</HI> the principal proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of it; and, re|&s;olving to pur&s;ue the profe&s;&s;ion of writing, he re|turned to <HI>London,</HI> as the mart where abilities of every kind were &s;ure of meeting di&s;tinction and reward. Here he determined to adopt a plan of the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy, and took lodgings in <HI>Green-Arbour-court,</HI> in the <HI>Old-Bailey,</HI> where he wrote &s;everal ingenious pieces. The late Mr. <HI>Newbery,</HI> who at that time gave great encouragement to men of literary abilities, became a kind of patron to our young author, and introduced him as one of the writers in the <HI>Public Ledger,</HI> in which his <HI>Citi|zen of the World</HI> originally appeared, under the title of <HI>'Chine&s;e Letters.'</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="12"><HI>"Fortune</HI> now &s;eemed to take &s;ome notice of a man &s;he had long neglected. The &s;implicity of his character, the integrity of his heart, and the me|rit of his productions, made his company very ac|ceptable to a number of re&s;pectable per&s;ons; and he emerged from his &s;habby apartments near the <HI>Old-Bailey</HI> to the politer air of the <HI>Temple,</HI> where he took hand&s;ome chambers, and lived in a gen|teel &s;tyle. The publication of his <HI>Traveller,</HI> his <HI>Vicar of Wakefield,</HI> and his <HI>Letters on the Hi&s;tory of England,</HI> was followed by the performance of his comedy of <HI>The Good-natured Man,</HI> at <HI>Covent-garden</HI> theatre, and placed him in the fir&s;t rank of the poets of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>"Our Doctor, as he was now univer&s;ally called, had a con&s;tant levee of his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed countrymen; who&s;e wants, as far as he was able, he always re|lieved; and he has been often known to leave him|&s;elf even without a guinea, in order to &s;upply the nece&s;&s;ities of others!</P>
<P>"Another feature in his character we cannot help laying before the reader. Previous to the publication of his <HI>De&s;erted Village,</HI> the book&s;eller had given him a note for one hundred guineas for the copy; which the Doctor mentioned, a few hours after, to one of his friends, who ob&s;erved it was a very great &s;um for &s;o &s;hort a performance. 'In truth,' replied <HI>Gold&s;mith,</HI> 'I think &s;o too; it is much more than the hone&s;t man can afford, or
<PB N="xii" REF="13">
the piece is worth; I have not been ea&s;y &s;ince I received it; therefore I will go back and return him his note;' which he ab&s;olutely did, and left it entirely to the book&s;eller to pay him according to the profits produced by the &s;ale of the poem, which turned out very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>"During the la&s;t rehear&s;al of his comedy, in|titled, <HI>She Stoops to Conquer,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Colman</HI> had no opinion would &s;ucceed, on the Doctor's objecting to the repetition of one of <HI>Tony Lumpkin</HI>'s &s;peeches, being apprehen&s;ive it might injure the play, the manager with great keenne&s;s replied, 'P&s;ha, my dear Doctor, do not be fearful of <HI>&s;quibs,</HI> when we have been &s;itting almo&s;t the&s;e two hours upon a <HI>barrel of gunpowder!'</HI> The piece, how|ever, contrary to Mr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s expectation, was received with uncommon applau&s;e by the audience; and <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI>'s pride was &s;o hurt by the &s;everity of the above ob&s;ervation, that it entirely put an end to his friend&s;hip for the gentleman who made it.</P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding the great &s;ucce&s;s of his pieces, by &s;ome of which, it is a&s;&s;erted, upon good autho|rity, he cleared 1800l. in one year, his circum|&s;tances were by no means in a pro&s;perous &s;ituation! partly owing to the liberality of his di&s;po&s;ition, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had con|tracted of gaming, the arts of which he knew very little of, and con&s;equently became the prey of
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">
tho&s;e who were unprincipled enough to take ad|vantage of his ignorance.</P>
<P>"Ju&s;t before his death, he had formed a de&s;ign for executing an <HI>Univer&s;al Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,</HI> the pro&s;pectus of which he actually print|ed, and di&s;tributed among his acquaintance. In this work, &s;everal of his literary friends (particu|larly Sir <HI>Jo&s;hua Reynolds,</HI> Dr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Beau|clerc,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garrick)</HI> had engaged to furni&s;h him with articles upon different &s;ubjects. He had entertained the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations from the &s;ucce&s;s of it. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that encouragement from the book&s;ellers which he had imagined it would un|doubtedly receive; and he u&s;ed to lament this circum&s;tance almo&s;t to the la&s;t hour of his exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>"He had been for &s;ome years afflicted, at different times, with a violent &s;trangury, which contributed not a little to imbitter the latter part of his life; and which, united with the vexations he &s;uffered upon other occa&s;ions, brought on a kind of habitual de&s;pondency. In this unhappy condition he was attacked by a nervous fever, which, being im|properly treated, terminated in his di&s;&s;olution on the 4th day of <HI>April,</HI> 1774, in the forty-third year of his age. His friends, who were very nu|merous and re&s;pectable, had determined to bury him in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey,</HI> where a tablet was to
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
have been erected to his memory. His pall was to have been &s;upported by Lord <HI>Shelburne,</HI> Lord <HI>Louth,</HI> Sir <HI>Jo&s;hua Reynolds,</HI> the Hon. Mr. <HI>Beau|clerc,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edmund Burke,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>; but, from &s;ome unaccountable circum&s;tances, this de|&s;ign was dropped, and his remains were privately depo&s;ited in the <HI>Temple</HI> burial-ground<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As there is no ve&s;tige for &s;trangers to di&s;tingui&s;h the place of his interment, a number of his admirers have long wi&s;hed for a &s;ub&s;cription to be opened towards erecting a tomb, or head-&s;tone, at his grave. The Publi&s;her of this Volume, anxious for this tribute to Genius and Friend&s;hip, will receive &s;ub&s;criptions from any of Dr. <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI>'s friends who may be inclined to patroni&s;e this undertaking.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"As to his character, it is &s;trongly illu&s;trated by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s line;
<Q>'In wit a man, &s;implicity a child.'</Q></P>
<P>"The learned lei&s;ure he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by di&s;tre&s;&s;es which aro&s;e from the openne&s;s of his temper, and which &s;ometimes threw him into loud fits of pa&s;&s;ion; but this impe|tuo&s;ity was corrected upon a moment's reflection; and his &s;ervants have been known, upon the&s;e oc|ca&s;ions, purpo&s;ely to throw them&s;elves in his way, that they might profit by it immediately after; for he who had the good fortune to be reproved, was certain of being rewarded for it. His di&s;ap|pointments at other times made him peevi&s;h and fullen, and he has often left a party of convivial
<PB N="xv" REF="16">
friends abruptly in the evening, in order to go home and brood over his misfortunes: a circum|&s;tance which contributed not a little to the increa&s;e of his malady.</P>
<P>"The univer&s;al e&s;teem in which his poems are held, and the repeated plea&s;ure they give in the peru&s;al, is a &s;triking te&s;t of their merit. He was a &s;tudious and correct ob&s;erver of nature, happy in the &s;election of his images, in the choice of his &s;ubjects, and in the harmony of his ver&s;ification; and, though his embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation prevented him from putting the la&s;t hand to many of his productions, his <HI>Hermit,</HI> his <HI>Traveller,</HI> and his <HI>De|&s;erted Village,</HI> bid fair to claim a place among the mo&s;t fini&s;hed pieces in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> language.</P>
<P>"The writer of the&s;e anecdotes cannot conclude without declaring, that, as different accounts have been given of this ingenious man, the&s;e are all founded upon facts, and collected by one who lived with him upon the mo&s;t friendly footing for a great number of years, and who never felt any &s;orrow more &s;en&s;ibly than that which was occa&s;ioned by his death."</P>
<P>Let it be turned to what theme it will, the opi|nion of an elevated literary character will &s;ucceed be&s;t with the million. Let us hear what Dr. <HI>John|&s;on</HI> &s;ays of our author, in his Life of <HI>Parnell.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="17">"THE Life of Dr. <HI>Parnell</HI> is a ta&s;k which I &s;hould very willingly decline, &s;ince it has been lately written by <HI>Gold&s;mith,</HI> a man of &s;uch variety of powers, and &s;uch felicity of performance, that he always &s;eemed to do be&s;t that which he was doing; a man who had the art of being minute without tediou&s;ne&s;s, and general without confu|&s;ion; who&s;e language was copious without exu|berance, exact without con&s;traint, and ea&s;y with|out weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>"What &s;uch an author has told, who would tell again? I have made an ab&s;tract from his larger narrative; and &s;hall have this gratification from my attempt, that it gives me an opportunity of paying due tribute to the memory of a departed genius."</P>
<P>The mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of the account which Mr. <HI>Davies</HI> has given of our author, in his Life of <HI>Garrick,</HI> de&s;erves the reader's attention The lat|ter part of it exhibits to mankind, feelings of the fir&s;t quality in nature.</P>
<P>EVERY thing of <HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> &s;eems to bear the magical touch of an enchanter; no man took le&s;s pains, and yet produced &s;o powerful an effect: the great beauty of his compo&s;ition con&s;i&s;ts in a clear, copious, and expre&s;&s;ive &s;tyle.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="18"><HI>Gold&s;mith</HI> was &s;o &s;incere a man, that he could not conceal what was uppermo&s;t in his mind: &s;o far from de&s;iring to appear in the eye of the world to the be&s;t advantage, he took more pains to be e&s;teemed wor&s;e than he was, than others do to appear better than they are.</P>
<P>His di&s;po&s;ition of mind was tender and compa&s;|&s;ionate; no unhappy per&s;on ever &s;ued to him for relief, without obtaining it, if he had any thing to give; and, rather than not relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, he would borrow. The poor woman, with whom he had lodged, during his ob&s;curity, &s;everal years in <HI>Green-Arbour Court,</HI> by his death lo&s;t an ex|cellent friend; for the Doctor often &s;upplied her with food from his table, and vi&s;ited her frequently with the &s;ole purpo&s;e to be kind to her. He had his di&s;like, as mo&s;t men have, to particular peo|ple, but unmixed with rancour. He, lea&s;t of all mankind, approved <HI>Baretti</HI>'s conver&s;ation; he con&s;idered him as an in&s;olent, over-bearing fo|reigner; as <HI>Baretti,</HI> in his turn, thought him an unpoli&s;hed man, and an ab&s;urd companion: but, when this unhappy <HI>Italian</HI> was charged with mur|der, and afterwards &s;ent by Sir <HI>John Fielding</HI> to <HI>Newgate, Gold&s;mith</HI> opened his pur&s;e, and would have given him every &s;hilling it contained; he, at the &s;ame time, in&s;i&s;ted upon going in the coach with him to the place of his confinement."</P>

<HEAD>EPITAPH ON DR. <HI>GOLDSMITH. By</HI> W. WOTY.</HEAD>
<L>ADIEU, &s;weet Bard! to each fine feeling true,</L>
<L>Thy virtues many, and thy foibles few;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e form'd to charm e'en vicious minds&mdash;and The&s;e</L>

<L>Yes&mdash;The&s;e &s;urvive to Time's remote&s;t day,</L>

<L>Go tune the lyre, and imitate his &s;train;</L>

<L>THE village-bell tolls out the note of Death,</L>

<L>With dreadful pau&s;e, reverberating deep,</L>
<L>Spreads the &s;ad tidings o'er fair <HI>Auburn</HI>'s vale.</L>

<HEAD>THE BEAUTIES OF GOLDSMITH.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>STORY OF MISS SYLVIA S&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>MISS SYLVIA S&mdash; was de&s;cended from one of the be&s;t families in the kingdom, and was left a large fortune upon her &s;i&s;ter's decea&s;e. She had early in life been introduced into the be&s;t com|pany, and contracted a pa&s;&s;ion for elegance and expence. It is u&s;ual to make the heroine of a &s;tory very witty, and very beautiful; and &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances are &s;o &s;urely expected, that they are &s;carce attended to. But whatever the fine&s;t poet could conceive of wit, or the mo&s;t celebrated painter imagine of beauty, were excelled in the perfections of this young lady. Her &s;uperiority in both was allowed by all, who either heard, or had &s;een her. She was naturally gay, generous to a fault, good-natured to the highe&s;t degree, affable in conver&s;ation; and &s;ome of her letters, and other writings, as well in ver&s;e as pro&s;e, would have &s;hone among&s;t tho&s;e of the mo&s;t celebrated wits of this, or any other age, had they been publi&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="35">But the&s;e great qualifications were marked by another, which le&s;&s;ened the value of them all. She was imprudent! But let it not be imagined, that her reputation or honour &s;uffered by her im|prudence; I only mean, &s;he had no knowledge of the u&s;e of money; &s;he relieved di&s;tre&s;s, by putting her&s;elf into the circum&s;tances of the object who&s;e wants &s;he &s;upplied.</P>
<P>She was arrived at the age of nineteen, when the croud of her lovers, and the continual repeti|tion of new flattery, had taught her to think &s;he could never be for&s;aken, and never poor. Young ladies are apt to expect a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s, from a number of lovers; and yet I have &s;eldom &s;een a girl courted by an hundred lovers, that found an hu&s;band in any. Before the choice is fixed, &s;he has either lo&s;t her reputation, or her good &s;en&s;e; and the lo&s;s of either is &s;ufficient to con&s;ign her to perpetual virginity.</P>
<P>Among the number of this young lady's lovers, was the celebrated <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, who, at that time, went by the name of <HI>the good-natured man.</HI> This gen|tleman, with talents that might have done honour to humanity, &s;uffered him&s;elf to fall at length into the lowe&s;t &s;tate of deba&s;ement. He followed the dictates of every newe&s;t pa&s;&s;ion; his love, his pity, his genero&s;ity, and even his friend&s;hips, were all in exce&s;s: he was unable to make head again&s;t any of his &s;en&s;ations or de&s;ires; but they were in
<PB N="3" REF="36">
general worthy wi&s;hes and de&s;ires; for he was con|&s;titutionally virtuous. This gentleman; who at la&s;t died in a gaol, was, at that time, this lady's envied favourite.</P>
<P>It is probable that he, thoughtle&s;s creature! had no other pro&s;pect from this amour, but that of pa&s;&s;ing the pre&s;ent moments agreeably. He only courted di&s;&s;ipation; but the lady's thoughts were fixed on happine&s;s. At length, however, his debts amounting to a con&s;iderable &s;um, he was arre&s;ted, and thrown into pri&s;on. He endeavoured at fir&s;t to conceal his &s;ituation from his beautiful mi&s;tre&s;s; but &s;he &s;oon came to a knowledge of his di&s;tre&s;s, and took a fatal re&s;olution of freeing him from confinement by di&s;charging all the demands of his creditors.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> was at that time in <HI>London,</HI> and re|pre&s;ented to the thoughtle&s;s young lady, that &s;uch a mea&s;ure would effectually ruin both; that &s;o warm a concern for the intere&s;ts of Mr. <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, would, in the fir&s;t place, quite impair her fortune in the eyes of our &s;ex, and, what was wor&s;e, le&s;&s;en her reputation in tho&s;e of her own. He added, that thus bringing Mr. <HI>S</HI>&mdash; from pri&s;on, would be only a temporary relief; that a mind &s;o gene|rous as his, would become bankrupt under the load of gratitude; and, in&s;tead of improving in friend|&s;hip or affection, he would only &s;tudy to avoid a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Then Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies at Bath.</NOTE>
<PB N="4" REF="37">
creditor he could never repay: that, though &s;mall favours produce good-will, great ones de&s;troy friend&s;hip. The&s;e admonitions, however, were di&s;regarded; and &s;he too late found the prudence and truth of her advi&s;er. In &s;hort, her fortune was by this means exhau&s;ted; and, with all her attractions, &s;he found her acquaintance began to di&s;e&s;teem her, in proportion as &s;he became poor.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation &s;he accepted Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI>'s invita|tion of returning to <HI>Bath.</HI> He promi&s;ed to intro|duce her to the be&s;t company there; and he was a&s;&s;ured that her merit would do the re&s;t. Upon her very fir&s;t appearance, ladies of the highe&s;t di&s;|tinction courted her friend&s;hip and e&s;teem; but a &s;ettled melancholy had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, and no amu&s;ements that they could propo&s;e were &s;ufficient to divert it. Yet &s;till, as if from habit, &s;he followed the crowd in its levities, and frequented tho&s;e places where all per&s;ons endea|vour to forget them&s;elves in the bu&s;tle of cere|mony and &s;how.</P>
<P>Her beauty, her &s;implicity, and her unguarded &s;ituation, &s;oon drew the attention of a de&s;igning wretch, who at that time kept one of the Rooms at <HI>Bath,</HI> and who thought that this lady's merit, properly managed, might turn to good account. This woman's name was Dame <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> a creature, who, though vicious, was in appearance &s;anctified; and, though de&s;igning, had &s;ome wit and humour. She began, by the humble&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, to ingratiate
<PB N="5" REF="38">
her&s;elf with Mi&s;s <HI>S</HI>&mdash;; &s;hewed that &s;he could be amu&s;ing as a companion, and, by frequent offers of money, proved that &s;he could be u&s;eful as a friend. Thus, by degrees, &s;he gained an entire a&s;cendant over this poor, thoughtle&s;s, de&s;erted girl; and, in le&s;s than one year, namely, about 1727, Mi&s;s <HI>S</HI>&mdash;, without ever tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the laws of virtue, had entirely lo&s;t her reputation. Whenever a per&s;on was wanting to make up a party for play at Dame <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI>'s, <HI>Sylvia,</HI> as &s;he was then familiarly called, was &s;ent for, and was obliged to &s;uffer all tho&s;e &s;lights, which the rich but too often let fall upon their inferiors in point of fortune.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t, even the greate&s;t minds, the heart at la&s;t becomes level with the meanne&s;s of its condi|tion; but in this charming girl it &s;truggled hard with adver&s;ity, and yielded to every encroachment of contempt with &s;ullen reluctance.</P>
<P>But though in the cour&s;e of three years &s;he was in the very eye of public in&s;pection, yet Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the architect, avers, that he could never, by the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervations, perceive her to be tainted with any other vice, than that of &s;uffering her&s;elf to be decoyed to the gaming-table, and, at her own hazard, playing for the amu&s;ement and ad|vantage of others. Her friend, Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> there|fore, thought proper to induce her to break off all connections with Dame <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> and to rent part of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s hou&s;e, in <HI>Queen-&s;quare,</HI> where &s;he
<PB N="6" REF="39">
behaved with the utmo&s;t complai&s;ance, regularity, and virtue.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, her dete&s;tation of life &s;till con|tinued; &s;he found, that time would infallibly de|prive her of part of her attractions, and that con|tinual &s;olicitude would impair the re&s;t. With the&s;e reflections &s;he would frequently entertain her&s;elf, and an old faithful maid, in the vales of <HI>Bath,</HI> whenever the weather would permit them to walk out. She would even &s;ometimes &s;tart que&s;tions in company, with &s;eeming unconcern, in order to know what act of &s;uicide was ea&s;ie&s;t, and which was attended with the &s;malle&s;t pain. When tired with exerci&s;e, &s;he generally retired to meditation; and &s;he became habituated to early hours of &s;leep and re&s;t. But when the weather prevented her u&s;ual exerci&s;e, and her &s;leep was thus more diffi|cult, &s;he made it a rule to ri&s;e from her bed, and walk about her chamber, till &s;he began to find an inclination for repo&s;e.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom made it nece&s;&s;ary for her to order a burning candle to be kept all night in her room: and the maid u&s;ually, when &s;he withdrew, locked the chamber-door; and, pu&s;hing the key under it beyond reach, her mi&s;tre&s;s, by that con&s;tant me|thod, lay undi&s;turbed till &s;even o'clock in the morning; then &s;he aro&s;e, unlocked the door, and rang the bell, as a &s;ignal for the maid to return.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="40">This &s;tate of &s;eeming piety, regularity, and prudence, continued for &s;ome time, till the gay, celebrated, toa&s;ted Mi&s;s <HI>Sylvia</HI> was &s;unk into an hou&s;ekeeper to the gentleman at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he lived. She was unable to keep company, for want of the elegancies of dre&s;s, that are the u&s;ual pa&s;s|port among the polite; and &s;he was too haughty to &s;eem to want them. The fa&s;hionable, the amu&s;ing, and the polite, in &s;ociety, now &s;eldom vi&s;ited her; and, from being once the object of every eye, &s;he was now de&s;erted by all, and preyed upon by the bitter reflections of her own impru|dence.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> and part of his family, were gone to <HI>London.</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Sylvia</HI> was left with the re&s;t, as a governe&s;s, at <HI>Bath.</HI> She &s;ometimes &s;aw Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> and acknowledged the friend&s;hip of his admoni|tions, though &s;he refu&s;ed to accept any other marks of his genero&s;ity than that of advice. Upon the clo&s;e of the day in which Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> was expected to re|turn from <HI>London,</HI> &s;he expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at the di&s;appointment of not &s;eeing him; took parti|cular care to &s;ettle the affairs of his family; and then, as u&s;ual, &s;at down to meditation. She now ca&s;t a retro&s;pect over her pa&s;t mi&s;conduct, and her ap|proaching mi&s;ery; &s;he &s;aw, that even affluence gave her no real happine&s;s, and from indigence &s;he thought nothing could be hoped but lingering calamity. She at length conceived the fatal re&s;o|lution of leaving a life, in which &s;he could &s;ee no
<PB N="8" REF="41">
corner for comfort, and terminating a &s;cene of imprudence in &s;uicide.</P>
<P>Thus re&s;olved, &s;he &s;at down at her dining-room window, and with cool intrepidity wrote the following elegant lines on one of the panes of the window:
<Q><L>O Death! thou plea&s;ing end of human woe!</L>
<L>Thou cure for life! Thou greate&s;t good below!</L>
<L>Still may'&s;t thou fly the coward, and the &s;lave,</L>
<L>And thy &s;oft &s;lumbers only ble&s;s the brave.</L></Q></P>
<P>She then went into company with the mo&s;t chearful &s;erenity; talked of indifferent &s;ubjects till &s;upper; which &s;he ordered to be got ready in a little library belonging to the family. There &s;he &s;pent the remaining hours, preceding bed-time, in dandling two of Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s children on her knees. In retiring from thence to her chamber, &s;he went into the nur&s;ery, to take her leave of another child, as it lay &s;leeping in the cradle. Struck with the innocence of the little babe's looks, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her meditated guilt, &s;he could not avoid bur&s;ting into tears, and hugging it in her arms; &s;he then bid her old &s;er|vant a good night, for the fir&s;t time &s;he had ever done &s;o, and went to bed as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>It is probable &s;he &s;oon quitted her bed, and was &s;eized with an alternation of pa&s;&s;ions, before
<PB N="9" REF="42">
&s;he yielded to the impul&s;e of de&s;pair. She dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in clean linen, and white garments of every kind, like a bride-maid. Her gown was pinned over her brea&s;t, ju&s;t as a nur&s;e pins the &s;waddling-clothes of an infant. A pink &s;ilk gir|dle was the in&s;trument with which &s;he re&s;olved to terminate her mi&s;ery, and this was lengthened by another made of gold thread. The end of the former was tied with a noo&s;e, and the latter with three knots, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from one another.</P>
<P>Thus prepared, &s;he &s;at down again, and read; for &s;he left the book open at that place, in the &s;tory of <HI>Olympia,</HI> in the <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o</HI> of <HI>Ari|o&s;to,</HI> where, by the perfidy and ingratitude of her bo&s;om friend, &s;he was ruined, and left to the mercy of an unpitying world. This tragical event gave her fre&s;h &s;pirits to go through her fatal purpo&s;e; &s;o &s;tanding upon a &s;tool, and fling|ing the girdle, which was tied round her neck, over a clo&s;et-door that opened into her chamber, &s;he remained &s;u&s;pended. Her weight however broke the girdle, and the poor de&s;pairer fell upon the floor with &s;uch violence, that her fall awakened a workman that lay in the hou&s;e about half an hour after two o'clock.</P>
<P>Recovering her&s;elf, &s;he began to walk about the room, as her u&s;ual cu&s;tom was when &s;he wanted &s;leep; and the workman imagining it to be only &s;ome ordinary accident, again went to
<PB N="10" REF="43">
&s;leep. She once more, therefore, had recour&s;e to a &s;tronger girdle made of &s;ilver thread; and this kept her &s;u&s;pended till &s;he died.</P>
<P>Her old maid continued in the morning to wait as u&s;ual for the ringing of the bell, and protracted her patience, hour after hour, till two o'clock in the afternoon; when the workmen at length en|tering the room through the window, found their unfortunate mi&s;tre&s;s &s;till hanging, and quite cold. The coroner's jury being impanelled, brought in their verdict, Lunacy; and her corp&s;e was next night decently buried in her father's grave, at the charge of a female companion, with whom &s;he had for many years an in&s;eparable intimacy.</P>
<P>Thus ended a female wit, a toa&s;t, and a game|&s;ter; loved, admired, and for&s;aken; formed for the delight of &s;ociety, fallen by imprudence into an object of pity. Hundreds in high life la|mented her fate, and wi&s;hed, when too late, to redre&s;s her injuries. They who once had helped to impair her fortune, now regretted that they a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;o mean a pur&s;uit. The little effects &s;he had left behind were bought up with the great|e&s;t avidity, by tho&s;e who de&s;ired to pre&s;erve &s;ome token of a companion that once had given them &s;uch delight. The remembrance of every virtue &s;he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of was now improved by pity. Her former follies were few, but the la&s;t &s;welled them to a large amount. As &s;he remains the

<HEAD>CALAMITIES.</HEAD>
<P>MAN little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear, till he tries them. As in a&s;cending the heights of ambition, which look bright from below, every &s;tep we ri&s;e &s;hews us &s;ome new and gloomy pro&s;pect of hidden di&s;ap|pointment; &s;o in our de&s;cent from the &s;ummits of plea&s;ure, though the vale of mi&s;ery below may appear at fir&s;t dark and gloomy, yet the bu&s;y mind, &s;till attentive to its own amu&s;ement, finds, as we de&s;cend, &s;omething to flatter and to plea&s;e. Still as we approach, the darke&s;t objects appear to brighten, and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy &s;ituation.

<P>BOOKS, while they teach us to re&s;pect the in|tere&s;ts of others, often make us unmindful of our own; while they in&s;truct the youthful reader to gra&s;p at &s;ocial happine&s;s, he grows mi&s;erable in detail, and, attentive to univer&s;al harmony, often forgets that he him&s;elf has a part to &s;u&s;tain in the

<P>LOVE is the mo&s;t ea&s;y and agreeable, and gra|titude the mo&s;t humiliating affection of the mind; we never reflect on the man we <HI>love,</HI> without ex|ulting in our choice, while he who has bound us to him by <HI>benefits</HI> alone, ri&s;es to our idea as a per|&s;on to whom we have in &s;ome mea&s;ure forfeited our freedom. Love and gratitude are &s;eldom therefore found in the &s;ame brea&s;t without impair+ing each other; we may tender the one or the other &s;ingly to tho&s;e we conver&s;e with, but can|not command both together. By attempting to in|crea&s;e, we dimini&s;h them; the mind becomes bank|rupt under too large obligations; all additional benefits le&s;&s;en every hope of future return, and bar up every avenue that leads to tenderne&s;s. <BIBL>IBID. v. 2. p. 3.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>OPINION OF WOMEN; WITH AN ACCOUNT OF CATHARINA ALEXOWNA, EMPRESS OF RUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE mode&s;t virgin, the prudent wife, or the careful matron, are much more &s;erviceable in life than petticoated philo&s;ophers, blu&s;tering heroines, or virago queens. She who makes her hu&s;band and her children happy, who reclaims the one from vice, and trains up the other to virtue, is a much greater character than ladies de&s;cribed in romance, who&s;e whole occupation is to murder mankind with &s;hafts from their quiver or their eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="83">Women, it has been ob&s;erved, are not naturally formed for great cares them&s;elves, but to &s;often ours. Their tenderne&s;s is the proper reward for the dangers we undergo for their pre&s;ervation; and the ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s of their conver&s;ation, our de&s;irable retreat from the fatigues of inten&s;e appli|cation. They are confined within the narrow li|mits of dome&s;tic a&s;&s;iduity; and when they &s;tray beyond them, they move beyond their &s;phere, and con&s;equently without grace.</P>
<P>Fame, therefore, has been very unju&s;tly di&s;|pen&s;ed, among the female &s;ex.

from the gaze of the world, by the labour of her hands &s;he &s;upported her parent, who was now incapable of &s;upporting her&s;elf. While <HI>Catharina</HI> &s;pun, the old woman would &s;it by, and read &s;ome book of devotion; thus, when the fatigues of the day were over, both would &s;it down contentedly by their fire-&s;ide, and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>Though her face and per&s;on were models of per|fection, yet her whole attention &s;eemed be&s;towed upon her mind; her mother taught her to read, and an old <HI>Lutheran</HI> mini&s;ter in&s;tructed her in the maxims and duties of religion. Nature had fur|ni&s;hed her not only with a ready, but a &s;olid turn of thought, not only with a &s;trong, but a right un|der&s;tanding. Such truly female accompli&s;hments procured her &s;everal &s;olicitations of marriage from the pea&s;ants of the country; but their offers were refu&s;ed; for &s;he loved her mother too tenderly to think of a &s;eparation.</P>
<P><HI>Catharina</HI> was fifteen when her mother died: &s;he now, therefore, left her cottage, and went to live with the <HI>Lutheran</HI> mini&s;ter, by whom &s;he had been in&s;tructed from her childhood. In his hou&s;e &s;he re&s;ided, in quality of governe&s;s to his children; at once reconciling in her character unerring pru|dence with &s;urpri&s;ing vivacity.</P>
<P>The old man, who regarded her as one of his own children, had her in&s;tructed in dancing and
<PB N="52" REF="85">
mu&s;ic, by the ma&s;ters who attended the re&s;t of his family. Thus &s;he continued to improve, till he died; by which accident &s;he was once more re|duced to pri&s;tine poverty. The country of <HI>Livo|nia</HI> was at this time wa&s;ted by war, and lay in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;tate of de&s;olation. Tho&s;e calami|ties are ever mo&s;t heavy upon the poor; wherefore <HI>Catharina,</HI> though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many accom|pli&s;hments, experienced all the mi&s;eries of hope|le&s;s indigence. Provi&s;ions becoming every day more &s;carce, and her private &s;tock being entirely exhau&s;ted, &s;he re&s;olved at la&s;t to travel to <HI>Marien|burgh,</HI> a city of greater plenty.</P>
<P>With her &s;canty wardrobe, packed up in a wal|let, &s;he &s;et out on her journey, on foot. She was to walk through a region mi&s;erable by nature, but rendered &s;till more hideous by the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> who, as each happened to become ma&s;ters, plundered it at di&s;cretion: but hunger had taught her to de&s;pi&s;e the dangers and fatigues of the way.</P>
<P>One evening, upon her journey, as &s;he had en|tered a cottage by the way-&s;ide, to take up her lodging for the night, &s;he was in&s;ulted by two <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> &s;oldiers, who in&s;i&s;ted upon qualifying her, as they termed it, <HI>to fellow &s;he camp.</HI> They might, probably, have carried their in&s;ults into violence, had not a &s;ubaltern officer, accidentally pa&s;&s;ing by, come in to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Upon his appearing, the &s;oldiers immediately de&s;i&s;ted; but her thank|fulne&s;s

was hardly greater than her &s;urpri&s;e, when &s;he in&s;tantly recollected, in her deliverer, the &s;on of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> mini&s;ter, her former in&s;tructor, benefactor, and friend.</P>
<P>This was an happy interview for <HI>Catharina.</HI> The little &s;tock of money &s;he had brought from home was by this time quite exhau&s;ted; her clothes were gone, piece by piece, in order to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who had entertained her in their hou&s;es: her gene|rous countryman, therefore, parted with what he could &s;pare, to buy her clothes, furni&s;hed her with an hor&s;e, and gave her letters of recommendation to Mr. <HI>Gluck,</HI> a faithful friend of his father's, and Superintendant of <HI>Marienburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Our beautiful &s;tranger had only to appear, to be well received: &s;he was immediately admitted into the Superintendant's family, as governe&s;s to his two daughters; and, though yet but &s;eventeen, &s;hewed her&s;elf capable of in&s;tructing her &s;ex, not only in virtue, but politene&s;s. Such was her good-&s;en&s;e and beauty, that her ma&s;ter him&s;elf in a &s;hort time offered her his hand, which to his great &s;ur|pri&s;e &s;he thought proper to refu&s;e. Actuated by a principle of gratitude, &s;he was re&s;olved to marry her deliverer only, even though he had lo&s;t an arm, and was otherwi&s;e disfigured by wounds, in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, to prevent further &s;olicita|tions from others, as &s;oon as the officer came to
<PB N="54" REF="87">
town upon duty, &s;he offered him her per&s;on, which he accepted with tran&s;port; and their nuptials were &s;olemni&s;ed as u&s;ual. But all the lines of her fortune were to be &s;triking: the very day on which they were married, the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> laid &s;iege to <HI>Ma|rienburgh.</HI> The unhappy &s;oldier had now no time to enjoy the well-earned plea&s;ures of matrimony; he was called off before con&s;ummation to an attack, from which he was never after &s;een to return.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the &s;iege went on with fury, aggravated on one &s;ide by ob&s;tinacy, on the other by revenge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous; the in|nocent pea&s;ant and the harmle&s;s virgin often &s;hared the fate of the &s;oldier in arms. <HI>Marienburgh</HI> was taken by a&s;&s;ault; and &s;uch was the fury of the a&s;|&s;ailants, that not only the garri&s;on, but almo&s;t all the inhabitants, men, women, and children, were put to the &s;word. At length, when the carnage was pretty well over, <HI>Catharina</HI> was found hid in an oven.</P>
<P>She had been hitherto poor, but &s;till was free; &s;he was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what it was to be a &s;lave: in this &s;ituation, how|ever, &s;he behaved with piety and humility; and, though misfortunes had abated her vivacity, yet &s;he was chearful. The fame of her merit and re|&s;ignation reached even Prince <HI>Menzikoff,</HI> the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> General: he de&s;ired to &s;ee her, was &s;truck with her beauty, bought her from the &s;oldier, her ma&s;ter,
<PB N="55" REF="88">
and placed her under the direction of his own &s;i&s;ter. Here &s;he was treated with all the re&s;pect which her merit de&s;erved, while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune.</P>
<P>She had not been long in this &s;ituation, when <HI>Peter the Great</HI> paying the Prince a vi&s;it, <HI>Catharina</HI> happened to come in with &s;ome dry fruits, which &s;he &s;erved round with peculiar mode&s;ty. The mighty monarch &s;aw, and was &s;truck with her beauty. He returned the next day, called for the beautiful &s;lave, a&s;ked her &s;everal que&s;tions, and found her under&s;tanding even more perfect than her per&s;on.</P>
<P>He had been forced, when young, to marry from motives of intere&s;t; he was now re&s;olved to marry pur&s;uant to his own inclinations. He im|mediately enquired the hi&s;tory of the fair <HI>Livonian,</HI> who was not yet eighteen. He traced her through the vale of ob&s;curity, through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of her fortune, and found her truly great in them all. The meanne&s;s of her birth was no ob&s;truc|tion to his de&s;ign; their nuptials were &s;olemni&s;ed in private; the Prince a&s;&s;uring his courtiers, that virtue alone was the propere&s;t ladder to a throne.</P>
<P>We now &s;ee <HI>Catharina,</HI> from the low, mud-walled cottage, Empre&s;s of the greate&s;t kingdom upon earth. The poor &s;olitary wanderer is now &s;urrounded by thou&s;ands, who find happine&s;s in her &s;mile. She, who formerly wanted a meal, is
<PB N="56" REF="89">
now capable of diffu&s;ing plenty upon whole na|tions. To her fortune &s;he owed a part of this pre|eminence, but to her virtues more.</P>
<P>She ever after retained tho&s;e great qualities which fir&s;t placed her on a throne; and while the extraordinary prince, her hu&s;band, laboured for the reformation of his male &s;ubjects, &s;he &s;tudied, in her turn, the improvement of her own &s;ex. She altered their dre&s;&s;es, introduced mixed a&s;&s;emblies, in&s;tituted an order of female knighthood, and, at length, when &s;he had greatly filled all the &s;tations of empre&s;s, friend, wife, and mother, bravely died without regret,&mdash;regretted by all. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>THE MAN OF THE WORLD. A TALE.</HEAD>
<P>IF you are fond of hearing <HI>hair-breadth '&s;capes,</HI> my hi&s;tory mu&s;t certainly plea&s;e; for I have been for twenty years upon the very verge of &s;tarving, without ever being &s;tarved.</P>
<P>My father, the younger &s;on of a good family, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;mall living in the church. His education was above his fortune, and his gene|ro&s;ity greater than his education. Poor as he was, he had his flatterers &s;till poorer than him&s;elf; for every dinner he gave them, they returned him an equivalent in prai&s;e; and this was all he wanted. The &s;ame ambition that actuates a monarch at the head of an army, influenced my father at the head of his table: he told the &s;tory of the ivy-tree, and that was laughed at; he repeated the je&s;t of the two &s;cholars and one pair of breeches, and the company laughed at that; but the &s;tory of Taffy in the &s;edan chair was &s;ure to &s;et the table in a roar. Thus his plea&s;ure increa&s;ed, in propor|tion to the plea&s;ure he gave: he loved all the world, and he fancied all the world loved him.</P>
<P>As his fortune was but &s;mall, he lived up to the very extent of it; he had no intentions of leaving his children money, for that was dro&s;s; he was re&s;olved they &s;hould have learning, for
<PB N="61" REF="94">
learning, he u&s;ed to ob&s;erve, was better than &s;il|ver or gold. For this purpo&s;e he undertook to in&s;truct us him&s;elf; and took as much pains to form our morals, as to improve our under&s;tanding. We were told that univer&s;al benevolence was what fir&s;t cemented &s;ociety: we were taught to con|&s;ider all the wants of mankind as our own; to regard the <HI>human face divine</HI> with affection and e&s;teem: he wound us up to be mere machines of pity, and rendered us incapable of with&s;tanding the &s;lighte&s;t impul&s;e made either by real or ficti|tious di&s;tre&s;s; in a word, we were perfectly in|&s;tructed in the art of <HI>giving away</HI> thou&s;ands, be|fore we were taught the more nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tions of <HI>getting</HI> a farthing.</P>
<P>I cannot avoid imagining, that, thus refined by his le&s;&s;ons out of all my &s;u&s;picion, and dive&s;ted of even all the little cunning which nature had given me, I re&s;embled, upon my fir&s;t entrance into the bu&s;y and in&s;idious world, one of tho&s;e gladiators who were expo&s;ed without armour in the amphi|theatre at Rome. My father, however, who had only &s;een the world on one &s;ide, &s;eemed to triumph in my &s;uperior di&s;cernment; though my whole &s;tock of wi&s;dom con&s;i&s;ted in being able to talk like him&s;elf upon &s;ubjects that once were u&s;eful, becau&s;e they were then topics of the bu&s;y world, but that now were utterly u&s;ele&s;s, becau&s;e con|nected with the bu&s;y world no longer.</P>

<P>After I had re&s;ided at college &s;even years, my father died, and left me&mdash;his ble&s;&s;ing. Thus &s;hoved from &s;hore without ill-nature to protect, or cunning to guide, or proper &s;tores to &s;ub&s;i&s;t me in &s;o dangerous a voyage, I was obliged to embark in the wide world at twenty-two. But, in order to &s;ettle in life, my friends <HI>advi&s;ed</HI> (for they always advi&s;e when they begin to de&s;pi&s;e us) they ad|vi&s;ed me, I &s;ay, to go into orders.</P>
<P>To be obliged to wear a long wig, when I liked a &s;hort one, or a black coat, when I generally dre&s;&s;ed in brown, I thought was &s;uch a re&s;traint upon my liberty, that I ab&s;olutely rejected the
<PB N="63" REF="96">
propo&s;al. A prie&s;t in England, is not the &s;ame mortified creature with a bonze in China; with us, not he that fa&s;ts be&s;t, but eats be&s;t, is reckon|ed the be&s;t liver: yet I rejected a life of luxury, indolence, and ea&s;e, from no other con&s;ideration but that boyi&s;h one of dre&s;s; &s;o that my friends were now perfectly &s;atisfied I was undone; and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the lea&s;t harm in him, and was &s;o very good-natured.</P>
<P>Poverty naturally begets dependance, and I was admitted as flatterer to a great man. At fir&s;t I was &s;urpri&s;ed, that the &s;ituation of a flatterer at a great man's table could be thought di&s;agreeable; there was no great trouble in li&s;tening attentively when his lord&s;hip &s;poke, and laughing when he looked round for applau&s;e. This even good-manners might have obliged me to perform. I found, however, too &s;oon, that his lord&s;hip was a greater dunce than my&s;elf; and from that very moment my power of flattery was at an end. I now rather aimed at &s;etting him right, than at re|ceiving his ab&s;urdities with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. To flatter tho&s;e we do not know, is an ea&s;y ta&s;k; but to flat|ter our intimate acquaintances, all who&s;e foibles are &s;trongly in our eye, is drudgery in&s;upportable. Every time I now opened my lips in prai&s;e, my fal&s;|hood went to my con&s;cience: his lord&s;hip &s;oon per+ceived me to be unfit for &s;ervice; I was therefore di&s;charged; my patron at the &s;ame time being
<PB N="64" REF="97">
graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve, that he believed I was tolerably good-natured, and had not the lea&s;t harm in me.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in ambition, I had recour&s;e to love. A young lady, who lived with her aunt, and was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a pretty fortune in her own di&s;po&s;al, had given me, as I fancied, &s;ome rea&s;ons to expect &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;ymptoms by which I was guided were &s;triking: &s;he had always laughed with me at her aukward acquaintance, and at her aunt among the number; &s;he always ob&s;erved, that a man of &s;en&s;e would make a better hu&s;band than a fool, and I as con&s;tantly applied the ob&s;ervation in my own favour. She continually talked in my company of friend&s;hip, and the beauties of the mind, and &s;poke of Mr. Shrimp my rival's high-heel'd &s;hoes with dete&s;tation. The&s;e were circum&s;tances which I thought &s;trongly in my fa|vour; &s;o, after re&s;olving, and re-re&s;olving, I had courage enough to tell her my mind. Mi&s;s heard my propo&s;al with &s;erenity, &s;eeming at the &s;ame time to &s;tudy the figures of her fan. Out at la&s;t it came. There was but one &s;mall objection to complete our happine&s;s, which was no more than &mdash;that &s;he was married three months before to Mr. Shrimp with high-heel'd &s;hoes! By way of con&s;o|lation, however, &s;he ob&s;erved, that, though I was di&s;appointed in her, my addre&s;&s;es to her aunt would probably kindle her into &s;en&s;ibility; as the old lady always allowed me to be very good-na|tured,
<PB N="65" REF="98">
and not to have the lea&s;t &s;hare of harm in me.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till I had friends, numerous friends; and to them I was re&s;olved to apply. O Friend&s;hip! thou fond &s;oother of the human brea&s;t, to thee we fly in every calamity; to thee the wretched &s;eek for &s;uccour; on thee the care-tired &s;on of mi&s;ery fondly relies; from thy kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance the unfor|tunate always hopes relief, and may be ever &s;ure of&mdash;di&s;appointment! My fir&s;t application was to a city &s;crivener, who had frequently offered to lend me money, when he knew I did not want it. I informed him, that now was the time to put his friend&s;hip to the te&s;t; that I wanted to borrow a couple of hundreds for a certain occa&s;ion, and was re&s;olved to take it up from him. And pray, Sir, cried my friend, do you want all this money? Indeed, I never wanted it more, returned I. I am &s;orry for that, cries the &s;crivener, with all my heart; for they who want money when they come to borrow, will always want money when they &s;hould come to pay.</P>
<P>From him I flew with indignation to one of the be&s;t friends I had in the world, and made the &s;ame reque&s;t. Indeed, Mr. Dry-bone, cries my friend, I always thought it would come to this. You know, Sir, I would not advi&s;e you but for your own good; but your conduct has hitherto been ri|diculous in the highe&s;t degree, and &s;ome of your
<PB N="66" REF="99">
acquaintance always thought you a very &s;illy fel|low. Let me &s;ee&mdash;you want two hundred pounds; do you want only two hundred, Sir, exactly? To confe&s;s a truth, returned I, I &s;hall want three hundred; but then I have another friend, from whom I can borrow the re&s;t. Why then, replied my friend, if you would take my advice&mdash;and you know I &s;hould not pre&s;ume to advi&s;e you but for your own good&mdash;I would recommend it to you to borrow the whole &s;um from that other friend; and then one note will &s;erve for all, you know.</P>
<P>Poverty now began to come fa&s;t upon me; yet, in&s;tead of growing more provident or cautious as I grew poor, I became every day more indolent and &s;imple. A friend was arre&s;ted for fifty pounds; I was unable to extricate him, except by becom|ing his bail. When at liberty, he fled from his creditors, and left me to take his place. In pri|&s;on I expected greater &s;atisfaction than I had en|joyed at large. I hoped to conver&s;e with men in this new world, &s;imple and believing like my&s;elf; but I found them as cunning and as cautious as tho&s;e in the world I had left behind. They &s;punged up my money whil&s;t it la&s;ted; borrowed my coals, and never paid them; and cheated me when I played at cribbage. All this was done becau&s;e they believed me to be very good-natured, and knew that I had no harm in me.</P>
<P>Upon my fir&s;t entrance into this man&s;ion, which is to &s;ome the abode of de&s;pair, I felt no &s;en&s;a|tions
<PB N="67" REF="100">
different from tho&s;e I experienced abroad. I was now on one &s;ide the door, and tho&s;e who were unconfined were on the other; this was all the difference between us. At fir&s;t, indeed, I felt &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, in con&s;idering how I &s;hould be able to provide this week for the wants of the week en&s;uing; but, after, &s;ome time, if I found my&s;elf &s;ure of eating one day, I never troubled my head how I was to be &s;upplied another. I &s;eized every precarious meal with the utmo&s;t good-humour, indulged, no rants of &s;pleen at my &s;itua|tion, never called down heaven and all the &s;tars to behold me dining upon an half-penny-worth of radi&s;hes; my very companions were taught to be|lieve that I liked &s;allad better than mutton. I contented my&s;elf with thinking, that all my life I &s;hould either eat white bread or brown; con|&s;idered that all that happened was be&s;t, laughed when I was not in pain, took the world as it went, and read Tacitus often, for want of more books and company.</P>
<P>How long I might have continued in this tor|pid &s;tate of &s;implicity I cannot tell, had I not been rou&s;ed by &s;eeing an old acquaintance, whom I knew to be a prudent blockhead, preferred to a place in the government. I now found that I had pur&s;ued a wrong track, and that the true way of be|ing able to relieve others, was to aim at indepen|dance my&s;elf. My immediate care, therefore, was to leave my pre&s;ent habitation, and make an entire re|formation
<PB N="68" REF="101">
in my conduct and behaviour. For a free, open, unde&s;igning deportment, I put on that of clo&s;ene&s;s, prudence and oeconomy. One of the mo&s;t heroic actions I ever performed, and for which I &s;hall prai&s;e my&s;elf as long as I live, was the refu&s;ing half a crown to an old acquaint|ance, at the time when he wanted it, and I had it to &s;pare; for this alone I de&s;erve to be decreed an ovation.</P>
<P>I now, therefore, pur&s;ued a cour&s;e of uninter|rupted frugality, &s;eldom wanted a dinner, and was con&s;equently invited to twenty. I &s;oon be|gan to get the character of a &s;aving hunks that had money; and in&s;en&s;ibly grew into e&s;teem. Neighbours have a&s;ked my advice in the di&s;po&s;al of their daughters, and I have always taken care not to give any. I have contracted a friend&s;hip with an alderman, only by ob&s;erving, that if we take a farthing from a thou&s;and pound, it will be a thou&s;and pound no longer. I have been invited to a pawnbroker's table, by pretending to hate gravy; and am now actually upon treaty of mar|riage with a rich widow, for only having ob&s;erved that bread was ri&s;ing. If ever I am a&s;ked a que&s;|tion, whether I know it or not, in&s;tead of an|&s;wering, I only &s;mile, and look wi&s;e. If a cha|rity is propo&s;ed, I go about with the hat, but put nothing in my&s;elf. If a wretch &s;olicits my pity, I ob&s;erve, that the world is filled with impo&s;tors; and take a certain method of not being deceived,
<PB N="69" REF="102">
by never relieving. In &s;hort, I now find the true&s;t way of finding e&s;teem, even from the indigent, is <HI>to give away nothing, and thus have much in our power to give.</HI> <BIBL>CIT. OF THE WORLD, v. 1. p. 103.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>EDUCATING CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE ever found it a vain ta&s;k to try to make a child's learning its amu&s;ement; nor do I &s;ee what good end it would an&s;wer, were it actually attained. The child ought to have its &s;hare of play, and it will be benefited thereby; and for every rea&s;on, al&s;o, it ought to have its &s;hare of labour. The mind, by early labour, will be thus accu&s;tomed to fatigues and &s;ubordination; and whatever be the per&s;on's future employment in life, he will be better fitted to endure it: he will be thus enabled to &s;upport the drudgeries of office with content, or to fill up the vacancies of life with variety. The child, therefore, &s;hould by times be put to its duty; and be taught to know, that the ta&s;k is to be done, or the puni&s;hment to be endured. I do not object again&s;t alluring it to duty by reward; but we well know, that the mind will be more &s;trongly &s;timulated by pain; and both may, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, take their turn to operate. In this manner, a child, by playing with its equals abroad, and labouring with them at &s;chool, will acquire more health and knowledge than by being bred up under the wing of any &s;pe|culative &s;y&s;tem-maker; and will be thus qualified for a life of activity and obedience. It is true, indeed, that, when educated in this manner, the boy may not be &s;o &s;eemingly &s;en&s;ible and forward as one bred up under &s;olitary in&s;truction; and, perhaps, this early forwardne&s;s is more engaging

than u&s;eful. It is well known, that many of tho&s;e children who are &s;uch prodigies of literature before ten, have not made an adequate progre&s;s to twenty.

<P>ALL our plea&s;ures, though &s;eemingly never &s;o remote from &s;en&s;e, derive their origin from &s;ome one of the &s;en&s;es. The mo&s;t exqui&s;ite demon&s;tra|tion in mathematics, or the mo&s;t plea&s;ing di&s;qui&s;i|tion in metaphy&s;ics, if it does not ultimately tend to increa&s;e &s;ome &s;en&s;ual &s;atisfaction, is delightful only to fools, or to men who have by long habit contracted a fal&s;e idea of plea&s;ure; and he who &s;eparates &s;en&s;ual and &s;entimental enjoyments, &s;eek|ing happine&s;s from mind alone, is in fact as wretched as the naked inhabitant of the fore&s;t, who places all happine&s;s in the fir&s;t, regardle&s;s of the latter. There are two extremes in this re&s;pect; the &s;avage who &s;wallows down the draught of plea|&s;ure without &s;taying to reflect on his happine&s;s, and the &s;age who pa&s;&s;eth the cup while he reflects on the conveniences of drinking. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>LOVE.</HEAD>
<P>LOVE, when founded in the heart, will &s;hew it&s;elf in a thou&s;and unpremeditated &s;allies of fond|ne&s;s; but every cool deliberate exhibition of the pa&s;&s;ion, only argues little under&s;tanding, or great in&s;incerity.</P>
<P><HI>Choang</HI> was the fonde&s;t hu&s;band, and <HI>Han&s;i</HI> the mo&s;t endearing wife, in all the kingdom of <HI>Korea:</HI> they were a pattern of conjugal bli&s;s; the inhabi|tants of the country around &s;aw, and envied their felicity; wherever <HI>Choang</HI> came, <HI>Han&s;i</HI> was &s;ure to follow; and in all the plea&s;ures of <HI>Han&s;i, Cho|ang</HI> was admitted a partner. They walked hand in hand wherever they appeared, &s;hewing every mark of mutual &s;atisfaction, embracing, ki&s;&s;ing; their mouths were for ever joined; and, to &s;peak in the language of anatomy, it was with them one per|petual ana&s;tomo&s;is.</P>
<P>Their love was &s;o great, that it was thought no|thing could interrupt their mutual peace; when an accident happened, which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di|mini&s;hed the hu&s;band's a&s;&s;urance of his wife's fide|lity; for love &s;o refined as his, was &s;ubject to a thou&s;and little di&s;quietudes.</P>
<P>Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at &s;ome di&s;tance from his hou&s;e, he there perceived a lady dre&s;&s;ed in the deepe&s;t mourning,
<PB N="81" REF="114">
(being cloathed all over in white) fanning the wet clay that was rai&s;ed over one of the graves with a large fan, which &s;he held in her hand. <HI>Choang,</HI> who had early been taught wi&s;dom in the &s;chool of <HI>Lao,</HI> was unable to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e for her pre|&s;ent employment; and, coming up, civilly demand|ed the rea&s;on. <Q REND="inline">"Alas!" replied the lady, her eyes bathed in tears, "how is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;urvive the lo&s;s of my hu&s;band, who lies buried in this grave?

I have employed two whole days in fulfilling his com|mands, and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed, even though his grave &s;hould take up four days in drying."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Choang,</HI> who was &s;truck with the widow's beauty, could not, however, avoid &s;miling at her ha&s;te to be married; but, concealing the cau&s;e of his mirth, civilly invited her home; adding, that he had a wife who might be capable of giving her &s;ome con&s;olation.

<P><PB N="82" REF="115">It is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe <HI>Han&s;i</HI>'s re&s;entment at &s;o unkind a &s;u&s;picion. As her pa&s;&s;ion for him was not only great, but extremely delicate, &s;he em|ployed tears, anger, frowns, and exclamations, to chide his &s;u&s;picions; the widow her&s;elf was in|veighed again&s;t; and <HI>Han&s;i</HI> declared &s;he was re|&s;olved never to &s;leep under the &s;ame roof with a wretch, who, like her, could be guilty of &s;uch barefaced incon&s;tancy. The night was cold and &s;tormy; however, the &s;tranger was obliged to &s;eek another lodging, for <HI>Choang</HI> was not di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t, and <HI>Han&s;i</HI> would have her way.</P>
<P>The widow had &s;carce been gone an hour, when an old di&s;ciple of <HI>Choang</HI>'s, whom he had not &s;een for many years, came to pay him a vi&s;it. He was received with the utmo&s;t ceremony, placed in the mo&s;t honourable &s;eat at &s;upper, and the wine began to circulate with great freedom. <HI>Choang</HI> and <HI>Han&s;i</HI> exhibited open marks of mutual tenderne&s;s and unfeigned reconciliation: nothing could equal their apparent happine&s;s; &s;o fond an hu&s;band, &s;o obe|dient a wife, few could behold without regretting their own infelicity; when, lo! their happine&s;s was at once di&s;turbed by a mo&s;t fatal accident. <HI>Choang</HI> fell lifele&s;s in an apoplectic fit upon the floor. Every method was u&s;ed, but in vain, for his recovery. <HI>Han&s;i</HI> was at fir&s;t incon&s;olable for his death: after &s;ome hours, however, &s;he found &s;pirits to read his la&s;t will.

<PB N="83" REF="116">
&s;he was able to comfort the young di&s;ciple; and, on the third, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, they both agreed to be married.</P>
<P>There was now no longer mourning in the apart|ments; the body of <HI>Choang</HI> was now thru&s;t into an old coffin, and placed in one of the meane&s;t rooms, there to lie unattended until the time pre|&s;cribed by law for his interment. In the mean time, <HI>Han&s;i,</HI> and the young di&s;ciple, were arrayed in the mo&s;t magnificent habits; the bride wore in her no&s;e a jewel of immen&s;e price, and her lover was dre&s;&s;ed in all the finery of his former ma&s;ter, together with a pair of artificial whi&s;kers that reached down to his toes. The hour of their nup|tials was arrived; the whole family &s;ympathi&s;ed with their approaching happine&s;s; the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffu&s;ed the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite perfume, and a lu&s;tre more bright than noon-day. The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apartment, with impatience; when his &s;ervant approaching with terror in his countenance, informed her, that his ma&s;ter was fallen into a fit, which would certainly be mortal, unle&s;s the heart of a man lately dead, could be obtained, and applied to his brea&s;t. She &s;carce waited to hear the end of his &s;tory, when, tucking up her clothes, &s;he ran with a mattock in her hand to the coffin, where <HI>Choang</HI> lay, re&s;olving to apply the heart of her dead hu&s;band as a cure for the living. She therefore &s;truck the lid with the ut|mo&s;t violence. In a few blows the coffin flew open,
<PB N="84" REF="117">
when the body, which to all appearance had been dead, began to move. Terrified at the &s;ight, <HI>Han&s;i</HI> dropped the mattock, and <HI>Choang</HI> walked out, a&s;toni&s;hed at his own &s;ituation, his wife's un|u&s;ual magnificence, and her more amazing &s;ur|pri&s;e. He went among the apartments, unable to conceive the cau&s;e of &s;o much &s;plendour. He was not long in &s;u&s;pence, before his dome&s;tics informed him of every tran&s;action &s;ince he fir&s;t became in|&s;en&s;ible. He could &s;carce believe what they told him, and went in pur&s;uit of <HI>Han&s;i</HI> her&s;elf, in order to receive more certain information, or to reproach her infidelity. But &s;he prevented his reproaches: he found her weltering in blood; for &s;he had &s;tabbed her&s;elf to the heart, being unable to &s;ur|vive her &s;hame and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P><HI>Choang,</HI> being a philo&s;opher, was too wi&s;e to make any loud lamentations; he thought it be&s;t to bear his lo&s;s with &s;erenity; &s;o, mending up the old coffin where he had lain him&s;elf, he placed his faithle&s;s &s;pou&s;e in his room; and, unwilling that &s;o many nuptial preparations &s;hould be expended in vain, he the &s;ame night married the widow with the large fan.</P>
<P>As they both were appri&s;ed of the foibles of each other before-hand, they knew how to excu&s;e them after marriage. They lived together for many years in great tranquillity, and not expecting rap|ture, made a &s;hift to find contentment. <BIBL>CIT. OF THE WORLD, v. 1. p. 63.</BIBL></P>

<P>JUSTICE may be defined, that virtue which impels us to give to every per&s;on what is his due.

<HEAD>ESSAY ON FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are few &s;ubjects which have been more written upon, and le&s;s under&s;tood, than that of Friend&s;hip. To follow the dictates of &s;ome, this virtue, in&s;tead of being the a&s;&s;uager of pain, be|comes the &s;ource of every inconvenience. Such &s;peculati&s;ts, by expecting too much from friend&s;hip, di&s;&s;olve the connexion, and, by drawing the bands too clo&s;ely, at length break them. Almo&s;t all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind; they per&s;uade us to friend&s;hips, which we find impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;u&s;tain to the la&s;t; &s;o that this &s;weetner of life, under proper regulations, is, by their means, rendered inacce&s;&s;ible or unea&s;y. It is certain, the be&s;t method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, make it&s;elf; a &s;imilitude of minds or &s;tudies, and even &s;ometimes a diver&s;ity of pur&s;uits, will produce all the plea&s;ures that ari&s;e from it. The current of tenderne&s;s widens, as it proceeds: and two men imperceptibly find their hearts warm with good-nature far each other,
<PB N="90" REF="123">
when they were at fir&s;t only in pur&s;uit of mirth or relaxation.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hip is like a debt of honour; the mo|ment it is talked of, it lo&s;es its real name, and a&s;&s;umes the more ungrateful form of obligation. From hence we find, that tho&s;e who regularly undertake to cultivate friend&s;hip, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That circle of beings, which dependance gathers round us, is al|mo&s;t ever unfriendly; they &s;ecretly wi&s;h the term of their connexions more nearly equal; and, where they even have the mo&s;t virtue, are pre|pared to re&s;erve all their affections for their pa|tron, only in the hour of his decline. Increa&s;ing the obligations which are laid upon &s;uch minds, only increa&s;es their burthen; they feel them&s;elves unable to repay the immen&s;ity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent re&s;ent|ment at the hand that it &s;tretched out with offers of &s;ervice and relief.</P>
<P><HI>Plautinus</HI> was a man who thought that every good was bought from riches; and as he was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of great wealth, and had a mind naturally formed for virtue, he re&s;olved to gather a circle of the be&s;t men round him. Among the number of his dependants was <HI>Mu&s;idorus,</HI> with a mind ju&s;t as fond of virtue, yet not le&s;s proud than his pa|tron. His circum&s;tances, however, were &s;uch as forced him to &s;toop to the good offices of his &s;u|perior,
<PB N="91" REF="124">
and he &s;aw him&s;elf daily among a number of others loaded with benefits and prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip. The&s;e, in the u&s;ual cour&s;e of the world, he thought it prudent to accept; but, while he gave his e&s;teem, he could not give his heart. A want of affection breaks out in the mo&s;t trifling in&s;tances, and <HI>Plautinus</HI> had &s;kill enough to ob|&s;erve the minute&s;t actions of the man he wi&s;hed to make his friend. In the&s;e he ever found his aim di&s;appointed; for <HI>Mu&s;idorus</HI> claimed an exchange of hearts, which <HI>Plautinus,</HI> &s;olicited by a variety of claims, could never think of be&s;towing.</P>
<P>It may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed, that the re&s;erve of our poor proud man, was &s;oon con&s;trued into in|gratitude; and &s;uch, indeed, in the common ac|ceptation of the world it was. Wherever <HI>Mu&s;i|dorus</HI> appeared, he was remarked as the ungrate|ful man; he had acccepted favours, it was &s;aid, and had &s;till the in&s;olence to pretend to indepen|dance. The event, however, ju&s;tified his conduct. <HI>Plautinus,</HI> by mi&s;placed liberality, at length be|came poor; and it was then that <HI>Mu&s;idorus</HI> fir&s;t thought of making a friend of him He flew to the man of fallen fortune, with an offer of all he had; wrought under his direction with a&s;&s;iduity; and by uniting their talents, both were at length placed in that &s;tate of life from which one of them had formerly fallen.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="125">To this &s;tory, taken from modern life, I &s;hall add one more, taken from a Greek writer of an|tiquity:&mdash;<Q REND="inline"><P>'Two Jewi&s;h &s;oldiers, in the time of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> had made many campaigns together; and a participation of dangers, at length, bred an union of hearts.

Their friend|&s;hip might have continued, without interruption, till death, had not the good fortune of the one alarmed the pride of the other, which was in his promotion to be a Centurion under the famous John, who headed a particular party of the Jew|i&s;h male-contents.</P>
<P>From this moment their former love was con|verted into the mo&s;t inveterate enmity. They at|tached them&s;elves to oppo&s;ite factions, and &s;ought each other's lives in the conflict of adver&s;e party.

<HEAD>SABINUS AND OLINDA.</HEAD>
<P>IN a fair, rich, flouri&s;hing country, who&s;e cliffs are wa&s;hed by the German ocean, lived <HI>Sabinus,</HI> a youth formed by Nature to make a conque&s;t
<PB N="95" REF="128">
wherever he thought proper; but the con&s;tancy of his di&s;po&s;ition fixed him only with <HI>Olinda.</HI></P>
<P>He was, indeed, &s;uperior to her in fortune; but that defect on her &s;ide was &s;o amply &s;upplied by her merit, that none was thought more worthy of his regards than &s;he. He loved her, he was be|loved by her; and, in a &s;hort time, by joining hands publicly, they avowed the union of their hearts. But, alas! none, however fortunate, however happy, are exempt from the &s;hafts of en|vy, and the malignant effects of ungoverned ap|petite. How un&s;afe, how dete&s;table are they who have this fury for their guide! How certainly will it lead them from them&s;elves, and plunge them in errors they would have &s;huddered at, even in ap|prehen&s;ion! <HI>Ariana,</HI> a lady of many amiable qua|lities, very nearly allied to <HI>Sabinus,</HI> and highly e&s;teemed by him, imagined her&s;elf &s;lighted, and injuriou&s;ly treated, &s;ince his marriage with <HI>Olinda.</HI> By incautiou&s;ly &s;uffering this jealou&s;y to corrode in her brea&s;t, &s;he began to give a loo&s;e to pa&s;&s;ion: &s;he forgot tho&s;e many virtues, for which &s;he had been &s;o long, and &s;o ju&s;tly applauded. Cau&s;e|le&s;s &s;u&s;picion, and mi&s;taken re&s;entment, betrayed her into all the gloom of di&s;content: &s;he &s;ighed without cea&s;ing; the happine&s;s of others gave her intolerable pain: &s;he thought of nothing but re|venge. How unlike what &s;he was, the chearful, the prudent, the compa&s;&s;ionate <HI>Ariana!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="129">She continually laboured to di&s;turb an union &s;o firmly, &s;o affectionately founded, and planned every &s;cheme which &s;he thought mo&s;t likely to di&s;|turb it.</P>
<P>Fortune &s;eemed willing to promote her unju&s;t intentions; the circum&s;tances of <HI>Sabinus</HI> had been long embarra&s;&s;ed by a tedious law-&s;uit, and the court determining the cau&s;e unexpectedly in favour of his opponent, it &s;unk his fortune to the lowe&s;t pitch of penury from the highe&s;t affluence.</P>
<P>From the nearne&s;s of relation&s;hip, <HI>Sabinus</HI> ex|pected from <HI>Ariana</HI> tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances his pre&s;ent &s;ituation required; but &s;he was in&s;en&s;ible to all his entreaties, and the ju&s;tice of every remon|&s;trance, unle&s;s he fir&s;t &s;eparated from <HI>Olinda,</HI> whom &s;he regarded with dete&s;tation. Upon a compliance with her de&s;ires in this re&s;pect, &s;he promi&s;ed her fortune, her intere&s;t, and her all, &s;hould be at his command. <HI>Sabinus</HI> was &s;hocked at the propo&s;al; he loved his wife with inexpre&s;|&s;ible tenderne&s;s, and refu&s;ed tho&s;e offers with in|dignation which were to be purcha&s;ed at &s;o high a price: <HI>Ariana</HI> was no le&s;s di&s;plea&s;ed to find her offers rejected, and gave a loo&s;e to all that warmth which &s;he had long endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>Reproach generally produces recrimination; the quarrel ro&s;e to &s;uch a height, that <HI>Sabinus</HI> was marked for de&s;truction; and the very next day,
<PB N="97" REF="130">
the &s;trength of an old family debt, he was &s;ent to jail, with none but <HI>Olinda</HI> to comfort him in his mi&s;eries. In this man&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s they lived together with re&s;ignation, and even with comfort. She provided the frugal meal, and he read for her while employed in the little offices of dome&s;tic concern. Their fellow-pri&s;oners admired their contentment, and whenever they had a de&s;ire of relaxing into mirth, and enjoying tho&s;e little comforts that a pri&s;on affords, <HI>Sabinus</HI> and <HI>Olinda</HI> were &s;ure to be of the party. In&s;tead of reproach|ing each for their mutual wretchedne&s;s, they both lightened it, by bearing each a &s;hare of the load impo&s;ed by Providence. Whenever <HI>Sabinus</HI> &s;hew|ed the lea&s;t concern on his dear partner's account, &s;he conjured him by the love he bore her, by tho&s;e tender ties which now united them for ever, not to di&s;compo&s;e him&s;elf: that &s;o long as his affection la&s;ted, the defied all the ills of fortune, and every lo&s;s of fame or friend&s;hip: that no thing could make her mi&s;erable, but his &s;eem|ing to want happine&s;s; nothing plea&s;ed but his &s;ympathi&s;ing with her plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>A continuance in pri&s;on &s;oon robbed them of the little they had left, and famine began to make its horrid appearance; yet &s;till was neither found to murmur: they both looked upon their little boy, who, in&s;en&s;ible of their or his own di&s;tre&s;s, was play|ing about the room with inexpre&s;&s;ible yet &s;ilent an|gui&s;h, when a me&s;&s;enger came to inform them that
<PB N="98" REF="131">
<HI>Ariana</HI> was dead; and that her will, in favour of a very di&s;tant relation, and who was now in ano|ther country, might be ea&s;ily procured, and burnt; in which ca&s;e, all her large fortune would revert to him, as being the next heir at law.</P>
<P>A propo&s;al of &s;o ba&s;e a nature filled our un|happy couple with horror; they ordered the me&s;|&s;enger immediately out of the room, and falling upon each other's neck, indulged an agony of &s;orrow: for now even all hopes of relief were ba|ni&s;hed. The me&s;&s;enger who made the propo&s;al, however, was only a &s;py &s;ent by <HI>Ariana</HI> to &s;ound the di&s;po&s;itions of a man &s;he loved at once and per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>This lady, though warped by wrong pa&s;&s;ions, was naturally kind, judicious and friendly. She found that all her attempts to &s;hake the con&s;tancy or the integrity of <HI>Sabinus</HI> were ineffectual: She had, therefore, begun to reflect, and to wonder how &s;he could, &s;o long and &s;o unprovoked, injure &s;uch uncommon fortitude and affection.</P>
<P>She had, from the next room, her&s;elf heard the reception given to the me&s;&s;enger, and could not avoid feeling all the force of &s;uperior virtue; &s;he therefore rea&s;&s;umed her former goodne&s;s of heart; &s;he came into the room with tears in her eyes, and acknowledged the &s;everity of her former treatment. She be&s;towed her fir&s;t care in
<PB N="99" REF="132">
providing them all the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and acknowledged them as the mo&s;t de&s;erving heirs of her fortune. From this moment <HI>Sabinus</HI> en|joyed an uninterrupted happine&s;s with <HI>Olinda,</HI> and both were happy in the friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of <HI>Ariana,</HI> who, dying &s;oon after, left them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large e&s;tate; and in her la&s;t moments confe&s;&s;ed, that Virtue was the only path to true glory; and that, however Innocence may for a time be depre&s;&s;ed, a &s;teady per&s;everance will in time lead it to a certain victory.</P>

<HEAD>DR. PRIMROSE's ADDRESS TO HIS FEL|LOW-PRISONERS. THE EQUAL DEALINGS OF PROVIDENCE DE|MONSTRATED WITH REGARD TO THE HAP|PY AND THE MISERABLE HERE BELOW. THAT FROM THE NATURE OF PLEASURE AND PAIN, THE WRETCHED MUST BE REPAID THE BALANCE OF THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LIFE HEREAFTER.</HEAD>
<P>MY friends, my children, and fellow-&s;ufferers, when I reflect on the di&s;tribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been given man to enjoy, yet &s;till more to &s;uffer. Though we &s;hould examine the whole world, we &s;hall not find one man &s;o happy as to have nothing left to wi&s;h for; but we daily &s;ee thou&s;ands, who, by &s;ui|cide, &s;hew us they have nothing left to hope. In this life, then, it appears that we cannot be en|tirely ble&s;t; but yet we may be completely mi&s;e|rable!</P>
<P>Why man &s;hould thus feel pain; why our wretchedne&s;s &s;hould be requi&s;ite in the formation of univer&s;al felicity; why, when all other &s;y&s;tems are made perfect only by the perfection of their &s;ubordinate parts, the great &s;y&s;tem &s;hould require
<PB N="112" REF="145">
for its perfection, parts that are not only &s;ubordi|nate to others, but imperfect in them&s;elves!&mdash; The&s;e are que&s;tions that never can be explained, and might be u&s;ele&s;s if known. On this &s;ubject, Providence has thought fit to elude our curio&s;ity, &s;atisfied with granting us motives to con&s;olation.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, man has called in the friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Philo&s;ophy; and Heaven, &s;eeing the incapacity of that to con&s;ole him, has given him the aid of Religion. The con&s;olations of Philo&s;o|phy are very amu&s;ing, but often fallacious. It tells us, that life is filled with comforts, if we will but enjoy them; and, on the other hand, that though we unavoidably have mi&s;eries here, life is is &s;hort, and they will &s;oon be over. Thus do the&s;e con&s;olations de&s;troy each other; for if life is a place of comfort, its &s;hortne&s;s mu&s;t be mi&s;ery; and, if it be long, our griefs are protracted. Thus philo&s;ophy is weak; but religion comforts in an higher &s;train. Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind, and preparing it for another abode. When the good man leaves the body, and is all a glorious mind, he will find he has been making him|&s;elf a heaven of happine&s;s here; while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated by his vices, &s;hrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has anticipated the vengeance of Heaven. To Religion, then, we mu&s;t hold, in every circum|&s;tance of life, for our true&s;t comfort; for, if al|ready we are happy, it is a plea&s;ure to think that
<PB N="113" REF="146">
we can make that happine&s;s unending; and, if we are mi&s;erable, it is very con&s;oling to think that there is a place of re&s;t. Thus, to the fortunate, Religion holds out a continuance of bli&s;s; to the wretched, a change from pain.</P>
<P>But, though Religion is very kind to all men, it has promi&s;ed peculiar reward to the unhappy; the &s;ick, the naked, the hou&s;ele&s;s, the heavy-laden, and the pri&s;oner, have ever mo&s;t frequent pro|mi&s;es in our &s;acred law. The Author of our Re|ligion every where profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the wretch's friend; and, unlike the fal&s;e ones of this world, be&s;tows all his care&s;&s;es upon the forlorn. The un|thinking have cen&s;ured this as a partiality, as a preference without merit to de&s;erve it; but they never reflect, that it is not in the power even of Heaven it&s;elf to make the offer of uncea&s;ing feli|city as great a gift to the happy as to the mi&s;e|rable. To the fir&s;t, eternity is but a &s;ingle ble&s;&s;|ing, &s;ince, at mo&s;t, it but increa&s;es what they al|ready po&s;&s;e&s;s. To the latter it is a double advan|tage; for it dimini&s;hes their pain here, and re|wards them with heavenly bli&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>But Providence is in another re&s;pect kinder to the poor than the rich; for, as it thus makes the life after death more de&s;irable, &s;o it &s;mooths the pa&s;|&s;age there. The wretched have long familiarity with every face of terror. The man of &s;orrows
<PB N="114" REF="147">
lays him&s;elf quietly down; he has no po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to regret, and but few ties to &s;top his departure: he feels only Nature's pang in the final &s;eparation, and this is no way greater than he has often faint|ed under before; for, after a certain degree of pain, every new breach that death opens in the con&s;titution, nature kindly covers with in&s;en&s;i|bility.</P>
<P>Thus Providence has given the wretched two advantages over the happy in this life, greater fe|licity in dying, and, in Heaven, all the &s;uperiority of plea&s;ure which ari&s;es from contra&s;ted enjoyment. And this &s;uperiority, my friends, is no &s;mall ad|vantage, and &s;eems to be one of the plea&s;ures of the poor man in the parable; for, though he was already in Heaven, and felt all the raptures it could give, yet it was mentioned as an addition to his happine&s;s, that he had once been wretched, and now was comforted; that he had known what it was to be mi&s;erable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</P>
<P>Thus, my friends, you &s;ee Religion does what Philo&s;ophy could never do: it &s;hews the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the unhap|py, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the &s;ame &s;tandard. It gives to both rich and poor the &s;ame happine&s;s hereafter, and equal hopes to a&s;pire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying plea&s;ure here, the poor have the end|le&s;s
<PB N="115" REF="148">
&s;atisfaction of knowing what it was once to be mi&s;erable, when crowned with endle&s;s feli|city hereafter; and even though this &s;hould be called a &s;mall advantage, yet, being an eternal one, it mu&s;t make up, by duration, what the temporal happine&s;s of the great may have exceeded by inten&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e are, therefore, the con&s;olations which the wretched have peculiar to them&s;elves, and in which they are above the re&s;t of mankind; in other re&s;pects they are below them. They who would know the mi&s;eries of the poor, mu&s;t &s;ee life and endure it. To declaim on the temporal ad|vantages they enjoy, is only repeating what none either believe or practi&s;e. The men who have the nece&s;&s;aries of living are not poor, and they who want them mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. Yes, my friends, we mu&s;t be mi&s;erable. No vain efforts of a re|fined imagination can &s;oothe the wants of nature, can give ela&s;tic &s;weetne&s;s to the dank vapour of a dungeon, or ea&s;e to the throbbings of a woe-worn heart. Let the Philo&s;opher from his couch of &s;oftne&s;s tell us that we can re&s;i&s;t all the&s;e. Alas! the effort by which we re&s;i&s;t them is &s;till the greate&s;t pain! Death is &s;light, and any man may &s;u&s;tain it; but torments are dreadful, and the&s;e no man can endure.</P>
<P>To us, then, my friends, the promi&s;es of hap|pine&s;s in Heaven &s;hould be peculiarly dear; for if
<PB N="116" REF="149">
our reward be in this life alone, we are then, in|deed, of all men the mo&s;t mi&s;erable. When I look round the&s;e gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us; this light that only &s;erves to &s;hew the horrors of the place, tho&s;e &s;hackles that tyranny has impo&s;ed, or crime made nece&s;|&s;ary; when I &s;urvey the&s;e emaciated looks, and hear tho&s;e groans, O my friends, what a glo|rious exchange would Heaven be for the&s;e! To fly through regions unconfined as air; to ba&s;k in the &s;un&s;hine of eternal bli&s;s; to carol over endle&s;s hymns of prai&s;e; to have no ma&s;ter to threaten or in&s;ult us, but the form of Goodne&s;s him&s;elf for ever in our eyes; when I think of the&s;e things, Death becomes the me&s;&s;enger of very glad tidings; when I think of the&s;e things, his &s;harp|e&s;t arrow becomes the &s;taff of my &s;upport; when I think of the&s;e things, what is there in life worth having? when I think of the&s;e things, what is there that &s;hould not be &s;purned away? Kings in their palaces &s;hould groan for &s;uch ad|vantages; but we, humbled as we are, &s;hould yearn for them.</P>
<P>And &s;hall the&s;e things be ours? Ours they will certainly be, if we but try for them; and, what is a comfort, we are &s;hut up from many tempta|tions that would retard our pur&s;uit. Only let us try for them, and they will certainly be ours, and, what is &s;till a comfort, &s;hortly too; for, if we look back on pa&s;t life, it appears but a very &s;hort &s;pan; and, whatever we may think of the re&s;t of
<PB N="117" REF="150">
life, it will yet be found of le&s;s duration: as we grow older, the days &s;eem to grow &s;horter, and our intimacy with time ever le&s;&s;ens the perception of his &s;tay. Then let us take comfort now, for we &s;hall &s;oon be at our journey's end; we &s;hall &s;oon lay down the heavy burthen laid by Heaven upon us; and though Death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the weary traveller with the view, and, like his horizon, &s;till flies before him; yet the time will certainly and &s;hortly come, when we &s;hall cea&s;e from our toil; when the luxurious great ones of the world &s;hall no more tread us to the earth; when we &s;hall think with plea&s;ure on our &s;ufferings below; when we &s;hall be &s;urrounded with all our friends, or &s;uch as de&s;erved our friend|&s;hip; when our bli&s;s &s;hall be unutterable, and &s;till, to crown all, unending. <BIBL>VIC.

<HEAD>STORY OF COLONEL <HI>M</HI>&mdash;.</HEAD>
<P>AT the conclu&s;ion of the treaty of peace at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> Col. <HI>M</HI>&mdash; was one of the thoughtle&s;s, agreeable, gay creatures, that drew the attention of the company at <HI>Bath.</HI> He danced and talked with great vivacity; and when he gamed among the ladies, he &s;hewed, that his attention was em|ployed rather upon their hearts than their fortunes. His own fortune, however, was a trifle, when com|pared to the elegance of his expence; and his im|prudence at la&s;t was &s;o great, that it obliged him to &s;ell an annuity, ari&s;ing from his commi&s;&s;ion, to keep up his &s;plendour a little logger.</P>
<P>However thoughtle&s;s he might be, he had the happine&s;s of gaining the affections of Mi&s;s <HI>L</HI>&mdash;, who&s;e father de&s;igned her a very large fortune. This lady was courted by a nobleman of di&s;tinc+tion; but &s;he refu&s;ed his addre&s;&s;es, re&s;olved upon gratifying rather her inclinations than her avarice.
<PB N="121" REF="154">
The intrigue went on &s;ucce&s;sfully between her and the Colonel, and they both would certainly have been married, and been undone, had not Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> appri&s;ed her father of their intentions. The old gentleman recalled his daughter from <HI>Bath,</HI> and offered Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> a very con&s;iderable pre&s;ent, for the care he had taken, which he refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Col. <HI>M</HI>&mdash; had an intima|tion how his intrigue came to be di&s;covered; and by taxing Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> found that his &s;u&s;picions were not without foundation. A challenge was the im|mediate con&s;equence; which the King of <HI>Bath,</HI> con&s;cious of having only done his duty, thought proper to decline. As none are permitted to wear &s;words at <HI>Bath,</HI> the Colonel found no opportunity of gratifying his re&s;entment, and waited with im|patience to find Mr. <HI>Na&s;h</HI> in town, to require proper &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>During this interval, however, he found his creditors became too importunate for him to re|main longer at <HI>Bath</HI>; and his finances and credit being quite exhau&s;ted, he took the de&s;perate re&s;o|lution of going over to the <HI>Dutch</HI> army in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where he enli&s;ted him&s;elf a volunteer. Here he underwent all the fatigues of a private centinel, with the additional mi&s;ery of receiving no pay; and his friends in <HI>England</HI> gave out, that he was &s;hot at the battle of &mdash;.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="155">In the mean time, the nobleman pre&s;&s;ed his pa&s;|&s;ion with ardour; but, during the progre&s;s of his amour, the young lady's father died, and left her heire&s;s to a fortune of fifteen hundred a year. She thought her&s;elf now di&s;engaged from her former pa&s;&s;ion. An ab&s;ence of two years had in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated her love for the Colonel; and the a&s;&s;iduity, the merit, and real regard, of the gen|tleman who &s;till continued to &s;olicit her, were al|mo&s;t too powerful for her con&s;tancy. Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> in the mean time, took every opportunity of en|quiring after Col. <HI>M</HI>&mdash;, and found that he had for &s;ome time been returned to <HI>England,</HI> but changed his name, in order to avoid the fury of his creditors; and that he was entered into a com|pany of &s;trolling players, who were at that time exhibiting at <HI>Peterborough.</HI></P>
<P>He now therefore thought he owed the Colonel, in ju&s;tice, an opportunity of promoting his for|tune, as he had once deprived him of an occa&s;ion of &s;atisfying his love. Our Beau, therefore, in|vited the lady to be of a party to <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and offered his own equipage, which was then one of the mo&s;t elegant in <HI>England,</HI> to conduct her there.

Thus, after a full indulgence of any one &s;en&s;e, the man of plea&s;ure finds a lan|guor in all, is placed in a cha&s;m between pa&s;t and expected enjoyment, perceives an interval which mu&s;t be filled up. The pre&s;ent can give no &s;atis|faction, becau&s;e he has already robbed it of every charm. A mind thus left without immediate em|ployment, naturally recurs to the pa&s;t or the fu|ture: the reflector finds that he was happy, and knows that he cannot be &s;o now; he &s;ees that he may yet be happy, and wi&s;hes the hour was come: thus every period of his continuance is mi&s;erable, except that very &s;hort one of immediate gratifica|tion.

Men of middling &s;tations are obliged to be content with pre&s;ents &s;omething le&s;s; while the beggar, who may be truly &s;aid to want indeed, is well paid if a farthing rewards his warme&s;t &s;oli|citations.</P>
<P>Every man who has &s;een the world, and has had his ups and downs in life, as the expre&s;&s;ion is, mu&s;t have frequently experienced the truth of this doctrine; and mu&s;t know, that to have much, or to &s;eem to have it, is the only way to have more. <HI>Ovid</HI> finely compares a man of broken fortune to a falling column; the lower it &s;inks, the greater is that weight it is obliged to &s;u&s;tain. Thus, when a man's circum&s;tances are &s;uch that he has no occa&s;ion to borrow, he finds numbers willing to lend him; but, &s;hould his wants be &s;uch that he &s;ues for a trifle, it is two to one whether he may be tru&s;ted with the &s;malle&s;t &s;um. A certain young fellow, whom I knew, whenever he had occa&s;ion to a&s;k his friend for a guinea, u&s;ed to prelude his reque&s;t as if he wanted two hundred; and talked &s;o familiarly of large &s;ums, that none could ever think he wanted a &s;mall one. The
<PB N="141" REF="174">
&s;ame gentleman, whenever he wanted credit for a &s;uit of clothes, always made the propo&s;al in a laced coat; for he found by experience, that, if he appeared &s;habby on the&s;e occa&s;ions, his tailor had taken an oath again&s;t tru&s;ting; or, what was every whit as bad, his foreman was out of the way, and &s;hould not be at home for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>There can be no inducements to reveal our wants, except to find pity, and, by this means, relief; but, before a poor man opens his mind in &s;uch circum&s;tances, he &s;hould fir&s;t con&s;ider whether he is contented to lo&s;e the e&s;teem of the per&s;on he &s;olicits, and whether he is willing to give up friend&s;hip to excite compa&s;&s;ion. Pity and Friend|&s;hip are pa&s;&s;ions incompatible with each other; and it is impo&s;&s;ible that both can re&s;ide in any brea&s;t for the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, without impairing each other. Friend&s;hip is made up of e&s;teem and plea&s;ure; Pity is compo&s;ed of &s;orrow and con|tempt; the mind may, for &s;ome time, fluctuate between them, but it can never entertain both at once.</P>
<P>In fact, Pity, though it may often relieve, is but, at be&s;t, a &s;hort-lived pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;eldom af|fords di&s;tre&s;s more than a tran&s;itory a&s;&s;i&s;tance: with &s;ome it &s;carce la&s;ts from the fir&s;t impul&s;e till the hand can be put into the pocket; with others, it may continue for twice that &s;pace; and on &s;ome, of extraordinary &s;en&s;ibility, I have &s;een it ope|rate

for half an hour together: but &s;till, la&s;t as it may, it generally produces but beggarly effects; and where, from this motive, we give five far|things, from others, we give pounds. Whatever be our feelings from the fir&s;t impul&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, when the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s &s;olicits a &s;econd, we then feel with dimini&s;hed &s;en&s;ibility; and, like the re|petition of an echo, every &s;troke becomes weaker; 'till, at la&s;t, our &s;en&s;ations lo&s;e all mixture of &s;orrow, and degenerate into downright contempt.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;peculations bring to my mind the fate of a very good-natured fellow, who is now no more. He was bred in a compting-hou&s;e, and his father dying ju&s;t as he was out of his time, left him an hand&s;ome fortune, and many friends to advi&s;e with. The re&s;traint in which my friend had been brought up, had thrown a gloom upon his tem|per, which &s;ome regarded as prudence; and, from &s;uch con&s;iderations, he had every day repeated offers of friend&s;hip. Such as had money, were ready to offer him their a&s;&s;i&s;tance that way; and they who had daughters, frequently, in the warmth of affection, advi&s;ed him to marry. My friend, however, was in good circum&s;tances; he wanted neither money, friends, nor a wife; and, there|fore, mode&s;tly declined their propo&s;als.</P>
<P>Some errors, however, in the management of his affairs, and &s;everal lo&s;&s;es in trade, &s;oon brought him to a different way of thinking; and he at
<PB N="143" REF="176">
la&s;t con&s;idered, that it was his be&s;t way to let his friends know that their offers were at length ac|ceptable. His fir&s;t addre&s;s was to a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A few lines here are borrowed, with a &s;light alte|ration, from the Man of the World, p. <HI>60.</HI> of this Vol.</NOTE> &s;crivener, who had formerly made him frequent offers of money and friend&s;hip, at a time when, perhaps, he knew tho&s;e offers would have been refu&s;ed. As a man, therefore, confident of not being refu&s;ed, he re|que&s;ted the u&s;e of a hundred guineas for a few days, as he ju&s;t then had occa&s;ion for money. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"And pray, Sir, replied the &s;crivener, "do you want all this money?"</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Want it, Sir?" &s;ays the other, If I did not want it, I &s;hould not have a&s;ked it."</Q> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;orry for that," &s;ays the friend; for tho&s;e who want money when they borrow, will always want money when they &s;hould come to pay.

<P>Not quite di&s;concerted by this refu&s;al, our ad|venturer was re&s;olved to apply to another, who he knew was the very be&s;t friend he had in the world. The gentleman whom he now addre&s;&s;ed, received his propo&s;al with all the affability that could be expected from generous friend&s;hip. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Let me &s;ee&mdash;you want an hundred guineas&mdash;and pray, dear Jack, would not fifty an&s;wer?"</Q>  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If you have but fifty to &s;pare, Sir, I mu&s;t be

A young lady, a di&s;tant relation by the mother's &s;ide, had a fortune in her own hands; and, as &s;he had already made all the advances that her &s;ex's mode&s;ty would permit, he made his pro|po&s;al with confidence.

&s;till he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure from actual nece&s;|&s;ity; the numberle&s;s invitations he had received to dine, even after his lo&s;&s;es, were yet unan&s;wered: he was therefore now re&s;olved to accent of a din|ner, becau&s;e he wanted one; and in this manner he actually lived among his friends a whole week, without being openly affronted. The la&s;t place I &s;aw him in, was at a reverend divine's. He had, as he fancied, ju&s;t nicked the time of dinner; for he came in as the doth was laying. He took a chair without being de&s;ired, and talked for &s;ome time without being attended to. He a&s;&s;ured the company, that nothing procured &s;o good an appe|tite as a walk in the Park, where he had been that morning. He went on, and prai&s;ed the figure of the dama&s;k table-cloth; talked of a fea&s;t where he had been the day before, but that the veni&s;on was over-done: but all this procured him no invita|tion. Finding, therefore, the gentleman of the hou&s;e in&s;en&s;ible to all his fetches, he thought pro|per, at la&s;t, to retire, and mend his appetite by a &s;econd walk in the Park.</P>

<P>NO ob&s;ervation is more common, and at the &s;ame time more true, than that one half of the world are ignorant how the other half lives. The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of declama|tion; and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble &s;ufferers: the great, under the pre&s;&s;ure of calamity, are con&s;cious of &s;everal others &s;ympa|thizing with their di&s;tre&s;s; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</P>
<P>There is nothing magnanimous in bearing mi&s;|fortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: men in &s;uch circum&s;tances will act bravely, even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of ob&s;curity, can brave adver&s;ity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintances to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his mi&s;|fortunes, can behave with tranquillity and indif|ference, is truly great: whether pea&s;ant or cour|tier, he de&s;erves admiration, and &s;hould be held up for our imitation and re&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="181">While the &s;lighte&s;t inconveniences of the great are magnified into calamities, while Tragedy mouths out their &s;ufferings in all the &s;trains of eloquence, the mi&s;eries of the poor are entirely di&s;regarded; and yet &s;ome of the lower ranks of people under|go more real hard&s;hips in one day, than tho&s;e of a more exalted &s;tation &s;uffer in their whole lives. It is inconceivable what difficulties the meane&s;t of our common &s;ailors and &s;oldiers endure, without mur|muring or regret; without pa&s;&s;ionately declaiming again&s;t providence, or calling their fellows to be gazers on their intrepidity. Every day is to them a day of mi&s;ery, and yet they entertain their hard fate without repining.</P>
<P>With what indignation do I hear an <HI>Ovid,</HI> a <HI>Cicero,</HI> or a <HI>Rabutin,</HI> complain of their misfor|tunes and hard&s;hips; who&s;e greate&s;t calamity was that of being unable to vi&s;it a certain &s;pot of earth, to which they had fooli&s;hly attached an idea of happine&s;s!

<P>I have been led into the&s;e reflections, from ac|cidentally meeting, &s;ome days ago, a poor fellow,
<PB N="149" REF="182">
whom I knew when a boy, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's jacket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been hone&s;t and indu&s;trious when in the country, and was curious to learn what had reduced him to his pre&s;ent &s;ituation; wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I de&s;ired to know the hi&s;|tory of his life and misfortunes, and the manner in which he was reduced to his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s. The di&s;abled &s;oldier, for &s;uch he was, though dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's habit, &s;cratching his head, and leaning on his crutch, put him&s;elf into an attitude to comply with my reque&s;t, and gave me his hi&s;tory, as follows.</P>
<P>"AS for my misfortune, ma&s;ter, I can't pre|tend to have gone through any more than other folks; for, except the lo&s;s of my limb, and my being obliged to beg, I don't know any rea&s;on, thank Heaven, that I have to complain; there is <HI>Bill Tibbs,</HI> of our regiment, he has lo&s;t both his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank Heaven, it is not &s;o bad with me yet.</P>
<P>"I was born in <HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI>; my father was a la|bourer, and died when I was five years old; &s;o I was put upon the pari&s;h. As he had been a wan|dering &s;ort of a man, the pari&s;hioners were not able to tell to what pari&s;h I belonged, or where I was born; &s;o they &s;ent me to another pari&s;h, and that pari&s;h &s;ent me to a third. I thought in my
<PB N="150" REF="183">
heart, they kept &s;ending me about &s;o long, that they would not let me be born in any pari&s;h at all; but, at la&s;t, however, they fixed me. I had &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to be a &s;cholar, and was re&s;olved, at lea&s;t, to know my letters; but the ma&s;ter of the work-hou&s;e put me to bu&s;ine&s;s as &s;oon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an ea&s;y kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not &s;uffered to &s;tir out of the hou&s;e, for fear, as they &s;aid, I &s;hould run away. But what of that? I had the liberty of the whole hou&s;e, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up both early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my bu|&s;ine&s;s well enough, till he died, when I was obliged to provide for my&s;elf; &s;o I was re&s;olved to go &s;eek my fortune.</P>
<P>"In this manner I went from town to town, worked when I could get employment, and &s;tarved when I could get none; when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a ju&s;tice of peace, I &s;pied a hare cro&s;&s;ing the path ju&s;t before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my &s;tick at it. Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away, when the ju&s;tice him&s;elf met me: he called me a poacher and a villain; and, collaring me, de&s;ired I would give an account of my&s;elf. I fell upon my knees,
<PB N="151" REF="184">
begged his wor&s;hip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, &s;eed, and generation; but, though I gave a very true account, the ju&s;tice &s;aid I could give no account; &s;o I was indicted at the &s;e&s;&s;ions, found guilty of being poor, and &s;ent up to <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Newgate,</HI> in order to be tran&s;ported as a vagabond.</P>
<P>"People may &s;ay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found <HI>Newgate</HI> as agreeable a place as ever I was in in all my life. I had my belly full to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to la&s;t for ever; &s;o I was taken out of pri&s;on, after five months, put on board a &s;hip, and &s;ent off, with two hundred more, to the plantations. We had but an indifferent pa&s;&s;age; for, being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of &s;weet air; and tho&s;e that remain+ed were &s;ickly enough, God knows. When we came a-&s;hore, we were &s;old to the planters, and I was bound for &s;even years more. As I was no &s;cholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes; and I &s;erved out my time, as in duty bound to do.</P>
<P>"When my time was expired, I worked my pa&s;&s;age home; and glad I was to &s;ee <HI>Old England</HI> again, becau&s;e I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I &s;hould be indicted for a vagabond once more, &s;o did not much care to go down into
<PB N="152" REF="185">
the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs, when I could get them.</P>
<P>"I was very happy in this manner for &s;ome time; till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then de&s;ired me to &s;tand. They belonged to a pre&s;s-gang. I was carried before the ju&s;tice, and, as I could give no account of my&s;elf, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or li&s;t for a &s;oldier. I cho&s;e the latter; and, in this po&s;t of a gentle|man, I &s;erved two campaigns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> was at the battles of <HI>Val</HI> and <HI>Fontency,</HI> and received but one wound, through the brea&s;t here; but the doc|tor of our regiment &s;oon made me well again.</P>
<P>"When the peace came on, I was di&s;charged; and, as I could not work, becau&s;e my wound was &s;ometimes trouble&s;ome, I li&s;ted for a landman in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> company's &s;ervice. I have fought the <HI>French</HI> in &s;ix pitched battles; and I verily be|lieve, that, if I could read or write, our Captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I &s;oon fell &s;ick, and &s;o got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, and I hoped to be &s;et on &s;hore, and to have the plea&s;ure of &s;pending my money; but the government wanted men, and &s;o I was pre&s;&s;ed for a &s;ailor be|fore ever I could &s;et foot on &s;hore.</P>

<P>"Our crew was carried into <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and many of them died, becau&s;e they were not u&s;ed to live in jail; but, for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was &s;ea&s;oned.

the effect which &s;uch a &s;pectacle has upon the va|riety of faces; the plea&s;ure it excites in &s;ome, the envy in others, and the wi&s;hes it rai&s;es in all. With this de&s;ign I lately went to &s;ee the entry of a foreign amba&s;&s;ador, re&s;olved to make one in the mob, to &s;hout as they &s;houted, to fix with ear|ne&s;tne&s;s upon the &s;ame frivolous objects, and par|ticipate, for a while, the plea&s;ures and the wi&s;hes of the vulgar.</P>
<P>Struggling here for &s;ome time, in order to be fir&s;t to &s;ee the cavalcade as it pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ome one of the crowd unluckily happened to tread upon my &s;hoe, and tore it in &s;uch a manner, that I was ut|terly unqualified to march forward with the main body, and obliged to fall back in the rear.

In&s;tead of our pre&s;ent pri&s;ons, which find or make men guilty, which inclo&s;e wretches for the com|mi&s;&s;ion of one crime, and return them, if returned alive, fitted for the perpetration of thou&s;ands, it were to be wi&s;hed we had, as in other parts of

<HI>Europe,</HI> places of penitence and &s;olitude, where the accu&s;ed might be attended by &s;uch as could give them repentance if guilty, or new motives of virtue if innocent. And this, but not the increa&s;|ing puni&s;hments, is the way to mend a &s;tate: nor can I avoid even que&s;tioning the validity of that right, which &s;ocial combinations have a&s;&s;umed, of capitally puni&s;hing offences of a &s;light nature. In ca&s;es of murder, their right is obvious; as it is the duty of us all, from the law of &s;elf-defence, to cut off that man who has &s;hewn a di&s;regard for the life of another. Again&s;t &s;uch, all nature ri&s;es in arms; but it is not &s;o again&s;t him who &s;teals my property. Natural law gives me no right to take away his life, as by that the hor&s;e he &s;teals is as much his property as mine. If, then, I have any right, it mu&s;t be from a compact made between us, that he who deprives the other of his hor&s;e &s;hall die. But this is a fal&s;e compact; becau&s;e no man has a right to barter his life, no more than to take it away; as it is not his own. And, next, the compact is inadequate, and would be &s;et a&s;ide, even in a court of modern equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience; &s;ince it is far better that two men &s;hould live, than that one man &s;hould ride. But a compact that is fal&s;e between two men, is equally &s;o be|tween an hundred, or an hundred thou&s;and; for as ten millions of circles can never make a &s;quare, &s;o the united voice of myriads cannot lend the &s;malle&s;t foundation to fal&s;ehood. It is thus that
<PB N="168" REF="201">
Rea&s;on &s;peaks; and untutored Nature &s;ays the &s;ame thing. Savages, that are directed nearly by natural law alone, are very tender of the lives of each other; they &s;eldom &s;hed blood but to retaliate former cruelty.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Saxon</HI> ance&s;tors, fierce as they were in war, had but few executions in times of peace; and in all commencing governments that have the print of nature &s;till &s;trong upon them, &s;carce any crime is held capital.</P>
<P>It is among the citizens of a refined community that penal laws, which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor. Government, while it grows older, &s;eems to acquire the moro&s;ene&s;s of age; and, as if our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were become dearer in proportion as they increa&s;ed, as if the more enormous our wealth the more exten&s;ive our fears, our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are paled with new edicts every day, and hung round with gibbets to &s;care every in|vader.</P>
<P>Whether is it from the number of our penal laws, or the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of our people, that this country &s;hould &s;hew more convicts in a year, than half the dominions of Europe united? Perhaps it is owing to both; for they mutually produce each other.

<P>It were to be wi&s;hed, then, that power, in&s;tead of contriving new laws to puni&s;h vice, in&s;tead of drawing hard the cords of &s;ociety till a convul|&s;ion come to bur&s;t them, in&s;tead of cutting away wretches as u&s;ele&s;s, before we have tried their uti|lity, in&s;tead of converting correction into ven|geance, it were to be wi&s;hed, that we tried the re&s;trictive arts of government, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant of the people.

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>DEATH is not that terrible thing which we &s;uppo&s;e it to be; it is a &s;pectre which frights us at a di&s;tance, but which di&s;appears when we come to approach it more clo&s;ely. Our ideas of its terrors are conceived in prejudice, and dre&s;&s;ed up by fancy; we regard it not only as the greate&s;t misfortune, but al&s;o as an evil accompanied with the mo&s;t ex|cruciating tortures: we have even increa&s;ed our apprehen&s;ions, by rea&s;oning on the extent of our &s;ufferings. It mu&s;t be dreadful, &s;ay &s;ome, &s;ince it is &s;ufficient to &s;eparate the &s;oul from the body; it mu&s;t be long, &s;ince our &s;ufferings are proportioned to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of our ideas; and the&s;e being painful, mu&s;t &s;ucceed each other with extreme ra|pidity. In this manner has fal&s;e philo&s;ophy la|boured to augment the mi&s;eries of our nature, and to aggravate that period which nature has kindly covered with in&s;en&s;ibility. Neither the mind, nor the body, can &s;uffer the&s;e calamities; the mind is, at that time, mo&s;tly without ideas; and the body too much enfeebled to be capable of perceiving its pain. A very acute pain produces either death, or fainting, which is a &s;tate &s;imilar to death: the body can &s;uffer but to a certain de|gree; if the torture becomes exce&s;&s;ive, it de&s;troys it&s;elf; and the mind cea&s;es to perceive, when the body can no longer endure.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="204">In this manner, exce&s;&s;ive pain admits of no re|flection; and, wherever there are any &s;igns of it, we may be &s;ure that the &s;ufferings of the patient are no greater than what we our&s;elves may have re|membered to endure.</P>
<P>But, in the article of death, we have many in|&s;tances in which the dying per&s;on has &s;hewn that very reflection which pre-&s;uppo&s;es an ab&s;ence of the greate&s;t pain; and, con&s;equently, that pang which ends life cannot even be &s;o great as tho&s;e which have preceded. Thus, when <HI>Charles</HI> XII. was &s;hot at the &s;iege of <HI>Frederick&s;hall,</HI> he was &s;een to clap his hand on the hilt of his &s;word; and, although the blow was great enough to ter|minate one of the bolde&s;t and brave&s;t lives in the world, yet it was not painful enough to de&s;troy reflection. He perceived him&s;elf attacked; he reflected that he ought to defend him&s;elf, and his body obeyed the impul&s;e of his mind, even in the la&s;t extremity. Thus it is the prejudice of per|&s;ons in health, and not the body in pain, that makes us &s;uffer from the approach of death: we have, all our lives, contracted an habit of making out exce&s;&s;ive plea&s;ures and pains; and nothing but repeated experience &s;hews us how &s;eldom the one can be &s;uffered, or the other enjoyed, to the utmo&s;t. If there be any thing nece&s;&s;ary to con|firm what we have &s;aid concerning the gradual ce&s;&s;ation of life, or the in&s;en&s;ible approaches of our end, nothing can more effectually prove it
<PB N="172" REF="205">
than the uncertainty of the &s;igns of death. If we con&s;ult what <HI>Win&s;low</HI> or <HI>Bruhier</HI> have &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, we &s;hall be convinced, that between life and death, the &s;hade is &s;o very undi&s;tingui&s;h|able, that even all the powers of art can &s;carcely determine where the one ends, and the other be|gins. The colour of the vi&s;age, the warmth of the body, the &s;upplene&s;s of the joints, are but un|certain &s;igns of life &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting; while, on the contrary, the palene&s;s of the complexion, the coldne&s;s of the body, the &s;tiffne&s;s of the extremi|ties, the ce&s;&s;ation of all motion, and the total in|&s;en&s;ibility of the parts, are but uncertain marks of death begun. In the &s;ame manner, al&s;o, with regard to the pul&s;e, and the breathing, the&s;e mo|tions are often &s;o kept under, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to perceive them. By approaching a looking-gla&s;s to the mouth of the per&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be dead, people often expect to find whether he breathes or not; but this is a very uncertain ex|periment: the gla&s;s is frequently &s;ullied by the vapour of the dead man's body; and often the per&s;on is &s;till alive, although the gla&s;s is no way tarni&s;hed. In the &s;ame manner, neither burning, nor &s;carifying; neither noi&s;es in the ears, nor pungent &s;pirits applied to the no&s;trils, give certain &s;igns of the di&s;continuance of life; and there are many in|&s;tances of per&s;ons who have endured them all, and afterwards recovered, without any external a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;pectators. How careful, therefore, &s;hould we be, before we commit

<HEAD>THE STROLLING PLAYER.</HEAD>
<P>I AM fond of amu&s;ement, in whatever company it is to be found; and wit, though dre&s;&s;ed in rags, is ever plea&s;ing to me. I went &s;ome days ago to take a walk in <HI>St. James's Park,</HI> about the hour in which company leave it to go to dinner. There were but few in the walks, and tho&s;e who &s;taid, &s;eemed, by their locks, rather more willing to for|get that they had an appetite than gain one. I &s;at down on one of the benches, at the other end of which was &s;eated a man in very &s;habby clothes.</P>
<P>We continued to groan, to hem, and to cough, as u&s;ual upon &s;uch occa&s;ions; and, at la&s;t, ven|tured upon conver&s;ation. <Q REND="inline">"I beg pardon, Sir," cried I, "but I think I have &s;een you before; your face is familiar to me."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"Yes, Sir," re|plied he, "I have a good familiar face, as my friends tell me. I am as well known in every town in <HI>England</HI> as the dromedary, or live croco|dile.
<PB N="175" REF="208">
You mu&s;t under&s;tand, Sir, that I have been the&s;e &s;ixteen years <HI>Merry Andrew</HI> to a puppet-&s;how; la&s;t <HI>Bartholomew</HI> fair my ma&s;ter and I quar|relled, beat each other, and parted; he to &s;ell his puppets to the pincu&s;hion-makers in <HI>Ro&s;emary|lane,</HI> and I to &s;tarve in <HI>St. James's Park.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"I am &s;orry, Sir, that a per&s;on of your ap|pearance &s;hould labour under any difficulties."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"O, Sir," returned he, "my appearance is very much at your &s;ervice; but, though I cannot boa&s;t of eating much, yet there are few that are merrier: if I had twenty thou&s;and a year, I &s;hould be very merry; and, thank the Fates, though not worth a groat, I am very merry &s;till. If I have three-pence in my pocket, I never refu&s;e to be my three-halfpence; and, if I have no money, I never &s;corn to be treated by any that are kind enough to pay my reckoning. What think you, Sir, of a &s;teak and a tankard? You &s;hall treat me now, and I will treat you again when I find you in the <HI>Park</HI> in love with eating, and without money to pay for a dinner."</Q></P>
<P>As I never refu&s;e a &s;mall expence for the &s;ake of a merry companion, we in&s;tantly adjourned to a neighbouring alehou&s;e; and, in a few moments, had a frothing tankard, and a &s;moaking &s;teak, &s;pread on the table before us. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s how much the &s;ight of &s;uch good cheer improved my companion's vivacity. <Q REND="inline">"I like this

dinner, Sir," &s;ays he, for three rea&s;ons: fir&s;t, becau&s;e I am naturally fond of beef; &s;econdly, becau&s;e I am hungry; and, thirdly and la&s;tly, becau&s;e I get it for nothing: no meat eats &s;o &s;weet as that for which we do not pay."</Q></P>
<P>He therefore now fell to, and his appetite &s;eemed to corre&s;pond with his inclination. After dinner was over, he ob&s;erved that the &s;teak was tough; <Q REND="inline">"and yet, Sir," returns he, "bad as it was, it &s;eemed a rump-&s;teak to me. O the de|lights of poverty and a good appetite! We beg|gars are the very foundlings of Nature: the rich &s;he treats like an errant &s;tep-mother; they are plea&s;ed with nothing: cut a &s;teak from what part you will, and it is in&s;upportably tough; dre&s;s it up with pickles,&mdash;even pickles cannot procure them an appetite. But the whole creation is filled with good things for the beggar; <HI>Calvert</HI>'s butt out-ta&s;tes champaigne, and <HI>Sedgeley</HI>'s home-brewed excels tokay. Joy, joy, my blood! though our e&s;tates lie no where, we have fortunes wherever we go. If an inundation &s;weeps away half the grounds of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> I am content; I have no lands there: if the &s;tocks &s;ink, that gives me no unea&s;ine&s;s; I am no <HI>Jew.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The fellow's vivacity, joined to his poverty, I own, rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity to know &s;omething of his life and circum&s;tances; and I intreated, that he would indulge my de&s;ire.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"That I will, Sir,"
<PB N="177" REF="210">
&s;aid he, "and welcome; only let us drink to pre|vent our &s;leeping; let us have another tankard while we are awake; let us have another tankard; for, ah! how charming a tankard looks when full!"</Q></P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know, then, that I am very well de&s;cended: my ance&s;tors have made &s;ome noi&s;e in the world; for my mother cried oy&s;ters, and my father beat a drum: I am told we have even had &s;ome trumpeters in our family. Many a noble|man cannot &s;hew &s;o re&s;pectful a genealogy: but that is neither here nor there. As I was their only child, my father de&s;igned to breed me up to his own employment, which was that of drummer to a puppet-&s;hew. Thus the whole employment of my younger years was that of interpreter to <HI>Punch</HI> and King <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his glory. But, though my father was very fond of in&s;tructing me in beating all the marches and points of war, I made no very great progre&s;s, becau&s;e I naturally had no ear for mu&s;ic; &s;o, at the age of fifteen, I went and li&s;ted for a &s;oldier. As I had ever hated beating a drum, &s;o I &s;oon found that I di&s;liked carrying a mu&s;ket al&s;o; neither the one trade nor the other were to my ta&s;te, for I was by nature fond of being a gentleman: be&s;ides, I was obliged to obey my captain; he has his will, I have mine, and you have yours: now I very rea&s;onably con|cluded, that it was much more comfortable for a man to obey his own will than another's.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="211">"The life of a &s;oldier &s;oon therefore gave me the &s;pleen: I a&s;ked leave to quit the &s;ervice; but, as I was tall and &s;trong, my captain thanked me for my kind intention, and &s;aid, becau&s;e he had a regard for me, we &s;hould not part. I wrote to my father a very di&s;mal penitent letter, and de&s;ired that he would rai&s;e money to pay for my di&s;charge; but the good man was as fond of drinking as I was (Sir, my &s;ervice to you), and tho&s;e who are fond of drinking never pay for other people's di&s;charges: in &s;hort, he never an&s;wered my letter. What could be done? If I have not moneys, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, to pay for my di&s;charge, I mu&s;t find an equivalent &s;ome other way; and that mu&s;t be by running away. I de&s;erted, and that an&s;wered my purpo&s;e every bit as well as if I had bought my di&s;charge.</P>
<P>"Well, I was now fairly rid of my military employment: I &s;old my &s;oldier's clothes, bought wor&s;e, and, in order not to be overtaken, took the mo&s;t unfrequented roads po&s;&s;ible. One evening, as I was entering a village, I perceived a man, whom I afterwards found to be the curate of the pari&s;h, thrown from his hor&s;e in a miry road, and almo&s;t &s;mothered in the mud. He de&s;ired my a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; I gave it, and drew him out with &s;ome difficulty. He thanked me for my trouble, and was going off; but I followed him home, for I loved always to have a man thank me at his own door. The curate a&s;ked an hundred que&s;tions; as, who&s;e &s;on I was; from whence I came; and whe|ther
<PB N="179" REF="212">
I would be faithful? I an&s;wered him greatly to his &s;atisfaction; and gave my&s;elf one of the be&s;t characters in the world for &s;obriety (Sir, I have the honour of drinking your health), di&s;cretion, and fidelity. To make a long &s;tory &s;hort, he wanted a &s;ervant, and hired me. With him I lived but two months; we did not much like each other: I was fond of eating, and he gave me but little to eat; I loved a pretty girl, and the old woman, my fellow-&s;ervant, was ill-natured and ugly. As they endeavoured to &s;tarve me between them, I made a pious re&s;olution to prevent their committing murder: I &s;tole the eggs as &s;oon as they were laid; I emptied every unfini&s;hed bottle that I could lay my hands on; whatever eatable came in my way was &s;ure to di&s;appear: in &s;hort, they found I would not do; &s;o I was di&s;charged one morning, and paid three &s;hillings and &s;ix|pence for two months wages.</P>
<P>"While my money was getting ready, I em|ployed my&s;elf in making preparations for my de|parture: two hens were hatching in an outhou&s;e; I went and habitually took the eggs, and, not to &s;eparate the parents from the children, I lodged hens and all in my knap&s;ack. After this piece of frugality, I returned to receive my money; and, with my knap&s;ack on my back, and a &s;taff in my hand, I bid adieu, with tears in my eyes, to my old benefactor. I had not gone far from the hou&s;e, when I heard behind me the cry of Stop
<PB N="180" REF="213">
thief! but this only increa&s;ed my di&s;patch; it would have been fooli&s;h to &s;top, as I knew the voice could not be levelled at me. But hold&mdash;I think I pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e two months at the curate's without drinking. Come, the times are dry; and may this be my poi&s;on, if ever I &s;pent two more pious, &s;tupid months in all my life!</P>
<P>"Well, after travelling &s;ome days, whom &s;hould I light upon but a company of &s;trolling players? The moment I &s;aw them at a di&s;tance, my heart warmed to them; I had a &s;ort of natural love for every thing of the vagabond order: they were employed in &s;ettling their baggage, which had been overturned in a narrow way. I offered my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which they accepted; and we &s;oon became &s;o well acquainted, that they took me as a &s;ervant. This was a paradi&s;e to me; they &s;ung, danced, drank, eat, and travelled, all at the &s;ame time. By the blood of the <HI>Mirabels,</HI> I thought I had never lived till then; I grew as merry as a grig, and laughed at every word that was &s;poken. They liked me as much as I liked them; I was a very good figure, as you &s;ee; and, though I was poor, I was not mode&s;t.</P>
<P>"I love a &s;traggling life above all things in the world; &s;ometimes good, &s;ometimes bad; to be warm to-day, and cold to-morrow; to eat when one can get it, and drink when (the tankard is out) it &s;tands before me. We arrived that evening at
<PB N="181" REF="214">
<HI>Tenterden,</HI> and took a large room at the <HI>Greyhound</HI>; where we re&s;olved to exhibit <HI>Romeo</HI> and <HI>Juliet,</HI> with the funeral proce&s;&s;ion, the grave and the garden &s;cene. <HI>Romeo</HI> was to be performed by a gentleman from the Theatre-Royal in <HI>Drury-lane; Juliet</HI> by a lady who never appeared on any &s;tage before; and I was to &s;nuff the candles: all excel|lent in our way. We had figures enough, but the difficulty was to dre&s;s them. The &s;ame coat that &s;erved <HI>Romeo,</HI> turned with the blue lining outwards, &s;erved for his friend <HI>Mercutio:</HI> a large piece of crape &s;ufficed at once for <HI>Juliet</HI>'s petticoat and pall: a pe&s;tle and mortar, from a neighbouring apothecary's, an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es of a bell; and our landlord's own family, wrapped in white &s;heets, &s;erved to fill up the proce&s;&s;ion. In &s;hort, there were but three figures among us that might be &s;aid to be dre&s;&s;ed with any propriety: I mean the nur&s;e, the &s;tarved apothecary, and my&s;elf. Our performance gave univer&s;al &s;atisfaction: the whole audience were enchanted with our powers; and <HI>Tenterden</HI> is a town of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>"There is one rule by which a &s;trolling-player may be ever &s;ecure of &s;ucce&s;s; that is, in our the|atrical way of expre&s;&s;ing it, to make a great deal of the character. To &s;peak and act as in common life, is not playing; nor is it what people come to &s;ee: natural &s;peaking, like &s;weet wine, runs glibly over the palate, and &s;carce leaves any ta&s;te behind it; but being high in a part re&s;embles vinegar,
<PB N="182" REF="215">
which grates upon the ta&s;te, and one feels it while he is drinking. To plea&s;e the town or country, the way is, to cry, wring, cringe into attitudes, mark the empha&s;is, &s;lap the pockets, and labour like one in the falling &s;ickne&s;s: that is the way to work for applau&s;e, that is the way to gain it.</P>
<P>"As we received much reputation for our &s;kill on this fir&s;t exhibition, it was but natural for me to a&s;cribe part of the &s;ucce&s;s to my&s;elf: I &s;nuffed the candles, and, let me tell you, that, without a candle-&s;nuffer, the piece would lo&s;e half its em|belli&s;hments. In this manner we continued a fort|night, and drew tolerable hou&s;es; but the evening before our intended departure, we gave out our very be&s;t piece, in which all our &s;trength was to be exerted. We had great expectations from this, and even doubled our prices; when, behold, one of the principal actors fell ill of a violent fever. This was a &s;troke like thunder to our little com|pany: they were re&s;olved to go, in a body, to &s;cold the man for falling &s;ick at &s;o inconvenient a time, and that, too, of a di&s;order that threatened to be expen&s;ive: I &s;eized the moment, and offered to act the part my&s;elf in his &s;tead. The ca&s;e was de&s;pe|rate; they accepted my offer; and I accordingly &s;at down, with the part in my hand and a tankard before me (Sir, your health), and &s;tudied the cha|racter, which was to be rehear&s;ed the next day, and played &s;oon after.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="216">"I found my memory exce&s;&s;ively helped by drinking: I learned my part with a&s;toni&s;hing ra|pidity, and bid adieu to &s;nuffing candles ever after. I found that Nature had de&s;igned me for more noble employments, and I was re&s;olved to take her when in the humour. We got together in order to rehear&s;e, and I informed, my compa|nions, ma&s;ters now no longer, of the &s;urpri&s;ing change I felt within me. Let the &s;ick man, &s;aid I, be under no unea&s;ine&s;s to get well again; I'll fill his place to univer&s;al &s;atisfaction; he may even die if he thinks proper; I'll engage that he &s;hall never be mi&s;&s;ed. I rehear&s;ed before them, &s;trutted, ranted, and received applau&s;e. They &s;oon gave out that a new actor of eminence was to appear, and immediately all the genteel places were be&s;poke. Before I a&s;cended the &s;tage, how|ever, I concluded within my&s;elf, that, as I brought money to the hou&s;e, I ought to have my &s;hare in the profits. Gentlemen, &s;aid I, addre&s;&s;ing our company, I don't pretend to direct you; far be it from me to treat you with &s;o much, ingratitude: you have publi&s;hed my name in the bills, with the utmo&s;t good-nature; and, as affairs &s;tand, cannot act without me: &s;o, gentlemen, to &s;hew you my gratitude, I expect to be paid for my acting as much as any of you, otherwi&s;e I declare off; I'll brandi&s;h my &s;nuffers, and clip candles as u&s;ual. This was a very di&s;agreeable propo&s;al; but they found that it was impo&s;&s;ible to refu&s;e it; it was ir|re&s;i&s;tible, it was adamant: they con&s;ented, and I
<PB N="184" REF="217">
went on in king <HI>Bajazet.</HI> My frowning brows, bound with a &s;tocking &s;tuffed into a turban, while on my captiv'd arms I brandi&s;hed a jack-chain. Nature &s;eemed to have fitted me for the part; I was tall, and had a loud voice; my very entrance excited univer&s;al applau&s;e; I looked round on the audience with a &s;mile, and made a mo&s;t low and graceful bow, for that is the rule among us. As it was a very pa&s;&s;ionate part, I invigorated my &s;pirits with three full gla&s;&s;es (the tankard is al|mo&s;t out) of brandy. By <HI>Alla!</HI> it is almo&s;t in|conceivable how I went through it; <HI>Tamerlane</HI> was but a fool to me; though he was &s;ometimes loud enough too, yet I was &s;till louder than he: but then, be&s;ides, I had attitudes in abundance: in general I kept my arms folded up thus, upon the pit of my &s;tomach; it is the way at <HI>Drury-Lane,</HI> and has always a fine effect. The tankard would &s;ink to the bottom before I could get through the whole of my merits: in &s;hort, I came off like a prodigy; and &s;uch was my &s;ucce&s;s, that I could ravi&s;h the laurels even from a &s;irloin of beef. The principal gentlemen and ladies of the town came to me after the play was over, to compli|ment me upon my &s;ucce&s;s; one prai&s;ed my voice, another my per&s;on: Upon my word, &s;ays the '&s;quire's lady, he will make one of the fine&s;t ac|tors in <HI>Europe</HI>; I &s;ay it, and I think I am &s;ome|thing of a judge.&mdash;Prai&s;e in the beginning is agreeable enough, and we receive it as a favour; but, when it comes in great quantities, we regard
<PB N="185" REF="218">
it only as a debt, which nothing but our merit could extort: in&s;tead of thanking them, I inter|nally applauded my&s;elf. We were de&s;ired to give our piece a &s;econd time; we obeyed, and I was applauded even more than before.</P>
<P>"At la&s;t we left the town, in order to be at a hor&s;e-race at &s;ome di&s;tance from thence. I &s;hall never think of <HI>Tenterden</HI> without tears of grati|tude and re&s;pect. The ladies and gentlemen there, take my word for it, are very good judges of plays and actors. Come, let us drink their healths, if you plea&s;e, Sir. We quitted the town, I &s;ay; and there was a wide difference between my coming in and going out: I entered the town a candle-&s;nuffer, and I quitted it an hero!&mdash;Such is the world! little to-day, and great to-morrow. I could &s;ay a great deal more upon that &s;ubject; &s;omething truly &s;ublime upon the ups and downs of fortune; but it would give us both the &s;pleen, and &s;o I &s;hall pa&s;s it over.</P>
<P>"The races were ended before we arrived at the next town, which was no &s;mall di&s;appointment to our company; however, we were re&s;olved to take all we could get. I played capital charac|ters there too, and came off with my u&s;ual bril|liancy. I &s;incerely believe I &s;hould have been the fir&s;t actor of <HI>Europe,</HI> had my growing merit been properly cultivated; but there came an unkindly fro&s;t which nipped me in the bud, and levelled me
<PB N="186" REF="219">

<P><PB N="190" REF="223"><HI>A&s;em</HI> had &s;pent his youth with men, had &s;hared in their amu&s;ements, and had been taught to love his fellow-creatures with the mo&s;t ardent affection: but, from the tenderne&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, he ex|hau&s;ted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.

<P>From a fortune thus &s;pent in benevolence, he expected a grateful return from tho&s;e he had for|merly relieved; and made his application with confidence of redre&s;s.

<P>At the foot of the mountain, an exten&s;ive lake di&s;played its gla&s;&s;y bo&s;om; reflecting, on its broad &s;urface, the impending horrors of the mountain.

<HEAD>LITERARY REPUTATION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY writer is now convinced that he mu&s;t be chiefly indebted to good fortune for finding readers willing to allow him any degree of repu|tation. It has been remarked, that almo&s;t every character which has excited either attention or pity, has owed part of its &s;ucce&s;s to merit, and part to an happy concurrence of circum&s;tances in its favour. Had <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> or <HI>Cromwell</HI> exchanged countries, the one might have been a &s;erjeant, and the other an exci&s;eman. So it is with wit, which generally &s;ucceeds more from being happily ad|dre&s;&s;ed, than from its native poignancy. A je&s;t calculated to &s;pread at a gaming-table, may be received with perfect indifference &s;hould it happen to drop in a mackarel-boat.

<HEAD>THE STORY OF <HI>ALCANDER</HI> AND <HI>SEP|TIMIUS,</HI> TAKEN FROM A BYZANTINE HISTORIAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ATHENS,</HI> long after the decline of the <HI>Roman</HI> empire, &s;till continued the &s;eat of learning, po|litene&s;s, and wi&s;dom. <HI>Theodoric,</HI> the <HI>O&s;trogoth,</HI> repaired the &s;chools which barbarity was &s;uffering to fall into decay, and continued tho&s;e pen&s;ions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized.</P>
<P>In this city, and about this period, <HI>Alcander</HI> and <HI>Septimius</HI> were fellow &s;tudents together; the one, the mo&s;t &s;ubtle rea&s;oner of all the <HI>Lyceum</HI>; the other, the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration &s;oon begot a friend|&s;hip. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they
<PB N="205" REF="238">
were natives of the two mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world; for <HI>Alcander</HI> was of <HI>Athens, Septimius</HI> came from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>In this &s;tate of harmony they lived for &s;ome time together, when <HI>Alcander,</HI> after pa&s;&s;ing the fir&s;t part of his youth in the indolence of philo|&s;ophy, thought at length of entering into the bu&s;y world; and, as a &s;tep previous to this, placed his affections on <HI>Hypatia,</HI> a lady of exqui&s;ite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were performed; and nothing now remained, but her being conducted in triumph to the apartment of the intended bridegroom.</P>
<P><HI>Alcander</HI>'s exultation in his own happine&s;s, or being unable to enjoy any &s;atisfaction without making his friend <HI>Septimius</HI> a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce <HI>Hypatia</HI> to his fellow-&s;tu|dent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found him&s;elf equally happy in friend&s;hip and love. But this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both; for <HI>Septimius</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw her, but he was &s;mitten with an involuntary pa&s;&s;ion; and, though he u&s;ed every effort to &s;uppre&s;s de&s;ires at once &s;o imprudent and unju&s;t, the emotions of his mind in a &s;hort time became &s;o &s;trong, that they brought on a fever, which the phy&s;icians judged incurable.</P>
<P>During this illne&s;s, <HI>Alcander</HI> watched him with all the anxiety of fondne&s;s, and brought his mi|&s;tre&s;s
<PB N="206" REF="239">
to join in tho&s;e amiable offices of friend&s;hip. The &s;agacity of the phy&s;icians, by the&s;e means, &s;oon di&s;covered that the cau&s;e of their patient's di&s;order was love; <HI>Alcander,</HI> being appri&s;ed of their di&s;covery, at length extorted a confe&s;&s;ion from the reluctant dying lover.</P>
<P>It would but delay the narrative to de&s;cribe the conflict between love and friend&s;hip in the brea&s;t of <HI>Alcander</HI> on this occa&s;ion; it is enough to &s;ay, that the <HI>Athenians</HI> were at that time arrived at &s;uch refinement in morals, that every virtue was carried to exce&s;s. In &s;hort, forgetful of his own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young <HI>Roman.</HI> They were married privately by his connivance, and this unlooked-for change of fortune wrought as unexpected a change in the con&s;titution of the now happy <HI>Septimius.</HI> In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and &s;et out with his fair partner for <HI>Rome.</HI> Here, by an exertion of tho&s;e talents which he was &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, <HI>Septimius,</HI> in a few years, arrived at the highe&s;t dignities of the &s;tate, and was con&s;tituted the city-judge, or praetor.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Alcander</HI> not only felt the pain of being &s;eparated from his friend and his mi&s;tre&s;s, but a pro&s;ecution was al&s;o commenced again&s;t him, by the relations of <HI>Hypatia,</HI> for having ba&s;ely given up his bride, as was &s;ugge&s;ted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own defence, were not able to
<PB N="207" REF="240">
with&s;tand the influence of a powerful party. He was ca&s;t, and condemned to pay an enormous fine. However, being unable to rai&s;e &s;o large a &s;um at the time appointed, his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were confi&s;cated, he him&s;elf was &s;tripped of the habit of freedom, expo&s;ed as a &s;lave in the market-place, and &s;old to the highe&s;t bidder.</P>
<P>A merchant of <HI>Thrace</HI> becoming his purcha&s;er, <HI>Alcander,</HI> with &s;ome other companions of di&s;tre&s;s, was carried into that region of de&s;olation and &s;teri|lity. His &s;tated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious ma&s;ter, and his &s;ucce&s;s in hunting was all that was allowed him to &s;upply his precarious &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of &s;ea&s;on &s;erved but to aggravate his un|&s;heltered di&s;tre&s;s. After &s;ome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of e&s;caping offered; he embraced it with ardour; &s;o that, travelling by night, and lodging in caverns by day, to &s;horten a long &s;tory, he at la&s;t arrived in <HI>Rome.</HI> The &s;ame day on which <HI>Alcander</HI> arrived, <HI>Septimius</HI> &s;at ad|mini&s;tering ju&s;tice in the forum, whither our wan|derer came, expecting to be in&s;tantly known, and publicly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he &s;tood the whole day among&s;t the crowd, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of; but he was &s;o much altered by a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hard&s;hips, that he continued unnoticed among the re&s;t; and, in the evening,
<PB N="208" REF="241">
when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repul&s;ed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night com|ing on, he now found him&s;elf under a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking a place to lie in, and yet knew not where to apply. All emaciated and in rags, as he was, none of the citizens would harbour &s;o much wretch|edne&s;s; and &s;leeping in the &s;treets might be at|tended with interruption or danger: in &s;hort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the u&s;ual retreat of guilt, poverty, and de&s;pair. In this man&s;ion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his mi&s;eries for a while in &s;leep; and found, on his flinty couch, more ea&s;e than beds of down can &s;upply to the guilty.</P>
<P>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but, hap|pening to di&s;agree about the divi&s;ion of their plun|der, one of them &s;tabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the entrance. In the&s;e circum&s;tances he was found next morning, dead, at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enquiry, an alarm was &s;pread; the cave was examined; and <HI>Alcander</HI> being found, was immediately apprehended, and accu&s;ed of rob|bery and murder. The circum&s;tances again&s;t him were &s;trong, and the wretchedne&s;s of his appear|ance confirmed &s;u&s;picion. Misfortune and he were
<PB N="209" REF="242">
now &s;o long acquainted, that he at la&s;t became re|gardle&s;s of life. He dete&s;ted a world where he had found only ingratitude, fal&s;ehood, and cruelty; he was determined to make no defence; and thus, lowering with re&s;olution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribunal of <HI>Septimius.</HI> As the proofs were po&s;itive again&s;t him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was pro|ceeding to doom him to a mo&s;t cruel and ignomi|nious death, when the attention of the multitude was &s;oon divided by another object. The robber, who had been really guilty, was apprehended &s;ell|ing his plunder, and, &s;truck with a panic, had confe&s;&s;ed his crime. He was brought bound to the &s;ame tribunal, and acquitted every other per|&s;on of any partner&s;hip in his guilt. <HI>alcander</HI>'s in|nocence therefore appeared, but the &s;ullen ra&s;hne&s;s of his conduct remained a wonder to the &s;urround|ing multitude; but their a&s;toni&s;hment was &s;till fur|ther increa&s;ed, when they &s;aw their judge &s;tart from his tribunal to embrace the &s;uppo&s;ed criminal. <HI>Septimius</HI> recollected his friend and former bene|factor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and of joy. Need the &s;equel be related? <HI>Alcander</HI> was acquitted; &s;hared the friend&s;hip and honours of the principal citizens of <HI>Rome</HI>; lived afterwards in happine&s;s and ea&s;e; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circum&s;tances are &s;o de&s;pe|rate, which Providence may not relieve. <BIBL>ESSAY 2.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>PLEASURES OF RURAL RETIREMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I reflect on the unambitious retire|ment in which I pa&s;&s;ed the earlier part of my life in the country, I cannot avoid feeling &s;ome pain
<PB N="211" REF="244">
in thinking that tho&s;e happy days are never to re|turn. In that retreat, all nature &s;eemed capable of affording plea&s;ure: I then made no refinements on happine&s;s, but could be plea&s;ed with the mo&s;t aukward efforts of ru&s;tic mirth; thought cro&s;s-purpo&s;es the highe&s;t &s;tretch of human wit, and que&s;tions and commands the mo&s;t rational way of &s;pending the evening. Happy could &s;o charming an illu&s;ion &s;till continue! I find that age and knowledge only contribute to &s;our our di&s;po&s;itions. My pre&s;ent enjoyments may be more refined, but they are infinitely le&s;s plea&s;ing. The plea&s;ure the be&s;t actor gives, can no way compare to that I have received from a country wag who imitated a Quaker's &s;ermon. The mu&s;ic of the fine&s;t &s;inger is di&s;&s;onance to what I felt when our old dairy-maid &s;ung me into tears with <HI>Johnny Arm&s;trong</HI>'s La&s;t Good Night, or the Cruelty of <HI>Barbara Allen.</HI></P>
<P>Writers of every age have endeavoured to &s;hew that plea&s;ure is in us, and not in the objects of|fered for our amu&s;ement. If the &s;oul be happily di&s;po&s;ed, every thing becomes capable of afford|ing entertainment; and di&s;tre&s;s will almo&s;t want a name. Every occurrence pa&s;&s;es in review like the figures of a proce&s;&s;ion; &s;ome may be aukward, others ill-dre&s;&s;ed; but none but a fool is for this enraged with the ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>I remember to have once &s;een a &s;lave in a forti|fication in <HI>Flanders,</HI> who appeared no way touched
<PB N="212" REF="245">
with his &s;ituation. He was maimed, deformed, and chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till night-fall; and condemned to this for life: yet, with all the&s;e circum&s;tances of apparent wretchedne&s;s, he &s;ang, would have danced but that he wanted a leg, and appeared the merrie&s;t, hap|pie&s;t man of all the garri&s;on. What a practical philo&s;opher was here! An happy con&s;titution &s;up|plied philo&s;ophy; and, though &s;eemingly de&s;titute of wi&s;dom, he was really wi&s;e. No reading or &s;tudy had contributed to di&s;enchant the fairy-land around him: every thing furni&s;hed him with an opportunity of mirth; and, though &s;ome thought him, from his in&s;en&s;ibility, a fool, he was &s;uch an ideot as philo&s;ophers &s;hould wi&s;h to imitate; for all philo&s;ophy is only forcing the trade of happi|ne&s;s, when nature &s;eems to have denied the means.</P>
<P>They who, like our &s;lave, can place them&s;elves on that &s;ide of the world in which every thing ap|pears in a plea&s;ing light, will find &s;omething in every occurrence to excite their good-humour. The mo&s;t calamitous events, either to them&s;elves or others, can bring no new affliction; the whole world is to them a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All the bu&s;tle of heroi&s;m, or the rants of ambition, &s;erve only to heighten the ab|&s;urdity of the &s;cene, and make the humour more poignant. They feel, in &s;hort, as little angui&s;h at their own di&s;tre&s;s; or the complaints of others, as the undertaker, though dre&s;&s;ed in black, feels &s;orrow at a funeral.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="246">Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Car|dinal <HI>de Retz</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this happine&s;s of temper in the highe&s;t degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and de&s;pi&s;ed all that wore the pedantic appearance of philo&s;ophy, wherever plea&s;ure was to be &s;old, he was generally foremo&s;t to rai&s;e the auction. Be|ing an univer&s;al admirer of the fair &s;ex, when he found one lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another, from whom he expected a more fa|vourable reception: if &s;he, too, rejected his ad|dre&s;&s;es, he never thought of retiring into de&s;erts, or pining in hopele&s;s di&s;tre&s;s: he per&s;uaded him|&s;elf, that, in&s;tead of loving the lady, he only fan|cied that he had loved her; and &s;o all was well again. When Fortune wore her angrie&s;t look, and he at la&s;t fell into the power of his mo&s;t deadly enemy, Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> (being confined a clo&s;e pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI>) he never at|tempted to &s;upport his di&s;tre&s;s by wi&s;dom or phi|lo&s;ophy, for he pretented to neither. He only laughed at him&s;elf and his per&s;ecutor, and &s;eemed infinitely plea&s;ed at his new &s;ituation. In this man&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;s, though &s;ecluded from his friends, though denied all the amu&s;ements, and even the conveniences, of life, he &s;till retained his good-humour; laughed at all the little &s;pite of his enemies; and carried the je&s;t &s;o far, as to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.</P>
<P>All that the wi&s;dom of the proud can teach, is to be &s;tubborn or &s;ullen under misfortunes. The

For my own part, I never pa&s;s by one of our pri&s;ons for debt, that I do not envy that feli|city which is &s;till going forward among tho&s;e peo|ple, who forget the cares of the world by being &s;hut out from its ambition.</P>
<P>The happie&s;t &s;illy fellow I ever knew, was of the number of tho&s;e good-natured creatures that are &s;aid to do no harm to any but them&s;elves. Whenever he fell into any mi&s;ery, he u&s;ually called it, Seeing Life. If his head was broke by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a &s;harper, he comforted him&s;elf by imitating the <HI>Hibernian</HI> dia|lect of the one, or the more fa&s;hionable cant of the other. Nothing came ami&s;s to him. His in|attention to money matters had incen&s;ed his father to &s;uch a degree, that all the interce&s;&s;ion of friends in his favour was fruitle&s;s.

<P>Yes, let the world cry out at a bankrupt who appears at a ball; at an author who laughs at the public, which pronounces him a dunce; at a ge|neral who &s;miles at the reproach of the vulgar, or the lady who keeps her good-humour in &s;pite of &s;candal; but &s;uch is the wi&s;e&s;t behaviour that any of us can po&s;&s;ibly a&s;&s;ume; it is certainly a better way to oppo&s;e calamity by di&s;&s;ipation, than to take up the arms of rea&s;on or re&s;olution to oppo&s;e it: by the fir&s;t method, we forget our mi&s;eries; by the la&s;t, we only conceal them from others: by &s;trug|gling with misfortunes, we are &s;ure to receive &s;ome wounds in the conflict; but a &s;ure method to come off victorious, is by running away. <BIBL>ESSAY 3.</BIBL></P>

<HEAD>PICTURE OF A CRITIC.</HEAD>
<P>A CRITIC is often guided by the &s;ame motives that direct his author. The author endeavours to per&s;uade us, that he has written a good book: the critic is equally &s;olicitous to &s;hew that he could write a better, had he thought proper. A critic is a being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the vanity, but not the genius, of a &s;cholar; incapable, from his native weakne&s;s, of lifting him&s;elf from the ground, he applies to contiguous merit for &s;upport, makes the &s;portive &s;allies of another's imagination his &s;erious employment, pretends to take our feelings under
<PB N="221" REF="254">
his care, teaches where to condemn, where to lay the empha&s;is of prai&s;e, and may with as much ju&s;tice be called a man of ta&s;te, as the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> who mea&s;ures his wi&s;dom by the length of his nails.</P>
<P>If, then, a book, &s;pirited or humorous, hap|pens to appear in the republic of letters, &s;everal critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a &s;ingle line of it, for them&s;elves had read it; and they know what is mo&s;t proper to excite laugh|ter. Other critics contradict the fulminations of this tribunal, call them all &s;piders, and a&s;&s;ure the public, that they ought to laugh without re&s;traint. Another &s;et are in the mean time quietly employed in writing notes to the book, intended to &s;hew the particular pa&s;&s;ages to be laughed at: when the&s;e are out, others &s;till there are who write notes upon notes. Thus a &s;ingle new book employs not only the paper-makers, the printers, the pre&s;s-men, the book binders, the hawkers, but twenty critics, and as many compilers. In &s;hort, the body of the learned may be compared to a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> army, where there are many pioneers, &s;everal &s;utlers, number|le&s;s &s;ervants, women and children in abundance, and but few &s;oldiers. <BIBL>CIT.

<HEAD>FORTUNE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF LOVE AND AFFECTION AMONG THE MODERNS.</HEAD>
<P>THE formalities, delays, and di&s;appointments, that precede a treaty of marriage <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">England.</NOTE> here, are u&s;ually as numerous as tho&s;e previous to a treaty of peace. The laws of this country are finely calculated to promote all commerce, but the commerce between the &s;exes. Their encouragements for propagating hemp, madder, and tobacco, are indeed admira|ble! Marriages are the only commodity that meets with di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>Yet, from the vernal &s;oftne&s;s of the air, the verdure of the fields, the tran&s;parency of the &s;treams, and the beauty of the women, I know few countries more proper to invite to court&s;hip. Here Love might &s;port among painted lawns and warbling groves, and revel amid&s;t gales wafting at once both fragrance and harmony. Yet it &s;eems he has for&s;aken the i&s;land; and when a couple are now to be married, mutual love, or an union of minds, is the la&s;t and mo&s;t trifling con&s;ideration. If their goods and chattels can be brought to unite, their &s;ympathetic &s;ouls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty. The gentleman's mort|gaged lawn becomes enamoured of the lady's mar|riageable grove; the match is &s;truck up; and both parties are piou&s;ly in love&mdash;according to act of parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="256">Thus, they who have fortune, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at lea&s;t of &s;omething that is lovely; but I actually pity tho&s;e who have none. I am told there was a time, when ladies, with no other merit but youth, virtue, and beauty, had a chance for hu&s;bands, at lea&s;t among&s;t our clergymen and officers. The blu&s;h and innocence of &s;ixteen was &s;aid to have a powerful influence over the&s;e two profe&s;&s;ions. But of late, all the little traffic of blu&s;hing, ogling, dimpling, and &s;miling, has been forbidden by an act in that ca&s;e wi&s;ely made and provided. A lady's whole cargo of &s;miles, &s;ighs, and whi&s;pers, is declared utterly contraband, till &s;he arrives in the warm latitude of twenty-two, where commo|dities of this nature are too often found to decay. She is then permitted to dimple and &s;mile, when the dimples begin to for&s;ake her; and, when per|haps grown ugly, is charitably intru&s;ted with an unlimited u&s;e of her charms. Her lovers, how|ever, by this time, have for&s;aken her; the captain has changed for another mi&s;tre&s;s; the prie&s;t him|&s;elf leaves her in &s;olitude, to bewail her virginity, and &s;he dies even without benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>Thus you find the <HI>Europeans</HI> di&s;couraging love with as much earne&s;tne&s;s as the rude&s;t &s;avage of <HI>Sofala.</HI> The Genius is &s;urely now no more.

his power. The Genius is certainly bani&s;hed from earth, though once adored under &s;uch a va|riety of forms. He is no where to be found; and all that the ladies of each country can produce, are but a few trifling reliques, as in&s;tances of his former re&s;idence and favour.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Genius of Love," &s;ays the Ea&s;tern Apo|logue, "had long re&s;ided in the happy plains of <HI>Abra,</HI> where every breeze was health, and every &s;ound produced tranquillity.

In return to this proclamation, emba&s;&s;ies were &s;ent from the ladies of every part of the world to invite him, and to di&s;play the &s;uperiority of their claims.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"And, fir&s;t, the beauties of <HI>China</HI> appeared.

They indulged no airs that might expre&s;s loo&s;e de&s;ire, and they &s;eemed to &s;tudy only the

graces of inanimate beauty. Their black teeth and plucked eye-brows were, however, alledged by the Genius again&s;t them; but he &s;et them en|tirely a&s;ide, when he came to examine their little feet.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The beauties of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> next made their ap|pearance.

Their dre&s;s was but half a covering; the neck, the left brea&s;t, and all the limbs were expo&s;ed to view; which, after &s;ome time, &s;eemed rather to &s;atiate than inflame de&s;ire. The lily and the ro&s;e contended in form|ing their complexions; and a &s;oft &s;leepine&s;s of eye added irre&s;i&s;tible poignance to their charms: but their beauties were obtruded, not offered, to their admirers; they &s;eemed to give, rather than receive court&s;hip; and the Genius of Love di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed them as unworthy his regard, &s;ince they exchanged the duties of love, and made them&s;elves not the pur&s;ued, but the pur&s;uing &s;ex.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The kingdom of <HI>Ka&s;hmire</HI> next produced its charming deputies. This happy region &s;eemed peculiarly &s;eque&s;tered by Nature for his abode.

<P><Q REND="inline">"In this proce&s;&s;ion the naked inhabitants of <HI>Southern America</HI> would not be left behind: their charms were found to &s;urpa&s;s whatever the warm|e&s;t imagination could conceive; and &s;erved to &s;hew, that beauty could be perfect, even with the &s;eeming di&s;advantage of a brown complexion. But their &s;avage education rendered them utterly un|qualified to make the proper u&s;e of their power, and they were rejected as being incapable of uni|ting mental with &s;en&s;ual &s;atisfaction. In this man|ner the deputies of other kingdoms had their &s;uits rejected: the black beauties of <HI>Benin,</HI> and the tawny daughters of <HI>Borneo,</HI> the women of <HI>Wida</HI> with &s;carred faces, and the hideous virgins of <HI>Ca|fraria</HI>; the &s;quab ladies of <HI>Lapland,</HI> three feet high, and the giant fair-ones of <HI>Patagonia.</HI></Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline">"The whole a&s;&s;embly was &s;truck with amaze|ment; they now ju&s;tly apprehended that female power would be no more, &s;ince love had for&s;aken them.
