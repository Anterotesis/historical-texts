<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ROM. xiv. 19.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Let us follow after the things which make for Peace, and things wherewith one may edifie another.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>THESE Words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> recommend two things to us, <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Mutual Edification;</HI> very proper to be di&s;cours'd of at this Time, as well as to be pur&s;u'd throughout our whole Lives. To the <HI>One</HI> we owe, whatever is Plea|&s;ant and Grateful to us in this Life; and to the <HI>Other,</HI> all the Happine&s;s we hope to enjoy in the Next.</P>
<P>Nor does the Apo&s;tle alone join the&s;e two together, but even God him&s;elf and the Nature of Things require &s;uch a Connexion. For while we live in <HI>Peace,</HI> we are more Ready in Finding out, more Happy in Executing, and more Succe&s;sful in Promoting tho&s;e Things that
<PB N="2" REF="4">
tend to <HI>Edification;</HI> and whil&s;t we &s;tudy <HI>Edification,</HI> Tranquillity of Mind and Brotherly Love flow in of cour&s;e. From hence it &s;eems very evident, that he will never attain to either, who doth not pro&s;ecute Both; and that the One can never be true and genuine with|out the Other. That <HI>Peace</HI> is fal&s;e and impious which ob&s;tructs <HI>Edification;</HI> and he is not the Servant of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> but of <HI>Satan,</HI> who under pretence of <HI>Edification</HI> violates <HI>Peace.</HI> For thus St. <HI>James</HI> argues; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. iii. <HI>V.</HI> 13, 14, 15.</NOTE><HI>Who</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>is a wi&s;e Man, and endued with Knowledge among&s;t you? Let him &s;hew out of a good Conver&s;ation his Works with Meek|ne&s;s of Wi&s;dom. But if ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not again&s;t the Truth. This Wi&s;dom de&s;cendeth not from Above, but is Earthly, Sen&s;ual, Devili&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>That therefore <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Edification</HI> &s;hould, every where, and in all Ages of the Church, go hand in hand together, is highly nece&s;&s;ary; and our Apo&s;tle, in this his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> recommends <HI>Both</HI> for a &s;pe|cial Rea&s;on: For the Church planted at <HI>Rome</HI> was then but young and tender, its Root not firm and deep, and yet was expos'd to the In&s;ults both of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> There were in that City &s;everal <HI>Weak</HI> Brethren, who were not well acquainted with the true Bounds of a <HI>Chri&s;tian Liberty.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V.</HI> 2. <HI>V.</HI> 5.</NOTE><HI>One believed that he might eat all things; another who was Weak, eat Herbs:</HI> And <HI>one Man e&s;teem'd every day alike, whil&s;t another e&s;teem'd one day above another,</HI> having not as yet &s;ufficiently &s;haken off the Yoke of the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation. From both the&s;e Extreams therefore very dangerous Con&s;equences were to be expected. On one &s;ide it was to be fear'd, le&s;t the better In&s;tructed Chri&s;tians &s;hould, by a vain O&s;ten|tation of their Liberty, draw over the Weaker to do that, with which their Con&s;cience could not as yet comply;
<PB N="3" REF="5">
which could never be con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Edification.</HI> Hence the Apo&s;tle advi&s;es; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V.</HI> 13, 14, 15.</NOTE><HI>Judge this rather, that no Man put a Stumbling-block, or an occa&s;ion to fall in his Brother's Way. I know,</HI> (adds he) <HI>and am per&s;waded by the Lord Je&s;us, that there is nothing unclean of it &s;elf: But to him that e&s;teemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. But if thy Brother be grieved with thy Meat, now walke&s;t thou not Charitably. De&s;troy not him with thy Meat, for whom Chri&s;t died.</HI></P>
<P>The Danger that threatned on the other hand was, le&s;t the mutual Conte&s;ts and Offences ari&s;ing about the&s;e Matters, &s;hould both di&s;turb the Peace of the Church, and give the common Enemy an opportunity of &s;cat|tering the Flock of Chri&s;t. For it was very natural for the <HI>Weak</HI> to condemn tho&s;e as <HI>Sinners,</HI> who made u&s;e of a Liberty, which they look'd upon as Criminal; and it was as natural for tho&s;e who were puff'd up with Knowledge, to de&s;pi&s;e them as <HI>Ignorant,</HI> who declin'd that Liberty, which they knew to be allowed by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. Now, what el&s;e would have been the I&s;&s;ue of the&s;e Conte&s;ts, but that the Weaker-minded, would either have return'd back again to <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> or have torn the Church to pieces by Schi&s;m? And that the Enemies of Chri&s;tianity, would have taken occa&s;ion from the Cen|&s;ure which each Party pa&s;s'd upon the other, to have cru&s;h'd them Both: cutting off tho&s;e who made u&s;e of their Liberty, as being wicked Men, by the Te&s;timony of the Weak; and oppre&s;&s;ing the Weak, who, in the Judgment of their Brethren, were a fooli&s;h and incon&s;iderable &s;ort of People? For how mean an Opi|nion mu&s;t the Infidels needs have conceiv'd of that Church, which by the Confe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tians them|&s;elves, was made up of <HI>Ignorant</HI> and <HI>Impious</HI> Per&s;ons?</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6">
Hence it is that St. <HI>Paul,</HI> as a faithful Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and one who regarded the Salvation of Both Parties, earne&s;tly exhorts them, in the fir&s;t place, to a mutual Forbearance: <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V.</HI> 5, 10, 12, 13.</NOTE><HI>Let every Man</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>be fully per&s;waded in his own Mind: But why do&s;t thou judge thy Brother? or why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy Brother? every one of us &s;hall give account of him&s;elf to God; let us not therefore judge one another any more.</HI> Then he per&s;wades tho&s;e, who had a right Notion of Chri&s;tian Liberty, <HI>not to put it on as a Cloak of Maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the Servants of God</HI> &s;o to temper it with Charity, that di&s;|regarding Matters of le&s;&s;er Moment, they would chiefly mind tho&s;e things that promote the Glory of God, and the good of Souls. After this he tells them, that by the&s;e Means the Church would gain to it &s;elf Protection from God, and Good-will from Men. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V.</HI> 16, 17. 18.</NOTE><HI>Let not then</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>your Good be evil &s;poken of; for the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; For he that in the&s;e things &s;erveth Chri&s;t is acceptable to God, and approved of Men.</HI> And then he &s;ubjoins the Admonition here in the Text, <HI>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for Peace, and things wherewith one may edifie ano|ther.</HI></P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Religion, through the Goodne&s;s of God, was planted very early in the&s;e <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> I&s;lands; And the &s;ame good hand of Divine Providence (to the Glory of God be it &s;poken) has convey'd it down to us, Reform'd in the la&s;t Age, re&s;cued from imminent Danger in our Times, and at pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and in a flouri&s;hing Condition. The&s;e are &s;uch In&s;tances of the Divine Favour as cannot be &s;ufficiently acknowledg'd or proclaim'd. However, the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our Church is not &s;o much better, than that of the <HI>Roman</HI> in the
<PB N="5" REF="7">
Primitive Times, but that this Advice of the Apo&s;tle may be as applicable to <HI>Us,</HI> as it was to tho&s;e <HI>Romans.</HI> The Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has &s;o far departed from the An|cient Doctrine of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> that having trampled under foot that true Faith, for which that Church was for|merly &s;o famous throughout the whole World, it is now become the bittere&s;t Enemy of our Pure and Primitive Religion; Heathen <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf not being more invete|rate again&s;t the Fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, than <HI>Chri&s;tian Rome</HI> (with Shame be it &s;poken!) is at pre&s;ent again&s;t the modern A&s;&s;erters and Maintainers of that Ancient Faith. It &s;eems to be the &s;ole End and De&s;ign of the Abetters of that Tyrannical See, either to reduce the Purer Churches of Chri&s;t to Slavery and Error, or el&s;e to ex|tirpate them by Con&s;piracies, War and Blood&s;hed. In the mean time, into how many Sects and Parties are <HI>We Prote&s;tants</HI> crumbled, too &s;ecure, alas! under all tho&s;e Dangers that hang over our Heads? With how many Conte&s;ts and Di&s;putes (many of which are of the &s;ame nature with tho&s;e treated of by St. <HI>Paul</HI> in this Epi&s;tle) are we con&s;tantly perplexed? And all this while, the E|nemies both of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Reformed</HI> Religion tri|umph openly; the <HI>One</HI> railing again&s;t <HI>Religion</HI> it &s;elf, as the Source of Contentions; and the <HI>Others</HI> arming <HI>Pro|te&s;tants</HI> again&s;t one another, that &s;o all of them in their turn may at la&s;t (without the Interpo&s;ition of Provi|dence) fall a Sacrifice to <HI>Roman</HI> Cruelty.</P>
<P>Not One of us therefore &s;ingly can imploy his private Thoughts and Endeavours better; nor can All of us to|gether, who are met in this <HI>Venerable Synod,</HI> direct our joint Wi&s;hes and Coun&s;els to a nobler End, than <HI>the following tho&s;e things which make for Peace and mutual Edification.</HI> If we neglect the <HI>Latter,</HI> we &s;hall have a Corrupt Church: and if we take no Care of the <HI>For|mer,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
we &s;hall have a Divided and Weak One, or perhaps None at all.</P>
<P>Wherefore my main De&s;ign at pre&s;ent is to lay be|fore you, <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> the&s;e things, which are more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary, being recommended by the Au|thority of the Great Apo&s;tle; that upon a thorough View of their Weight and Value in the Church, we may all of us be con&s;tantly &s;o far concerned for them, as to &s;eek them with our Prayers, promote them by our Coun&s;els, and pro&s;ecute them by our Endeavours. And to this End, I &s;hall make u&s;e only of &s;uch Arguments as occur to my Thoughts, upon con&s;idering the Nature of the Things them&s;elves, and the pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Refor|med Church.</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t of tho&s;e that relate to <HI>Peace;</HI> and Secondly, of &s;uch as belong to <HI>Edifica|tion.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>I. In di&s;cour&s;ing of <HI>Peace,</HI> the&s;e two Things de&s;erve our particular Enquiry. 1. What &s;ort of <HI>Peace</HI> that is, which we ought to follow. 2. Of what Moment &s;uch a <HI>Peace</HI> is, our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> for the right under&s;tanding what &s;ort of <HI>Peace</HI> that is, which we ought to follow, we mu&s;t di|&s;tinctly con&s;ider with whom it is to be made; becau&s;e the Bonds or Obligations of <HI>Peace</HI> vary according to the Variety of the Per&s;ons with whom we are to make it. For by how much the clo&s;er Men are apt to be uni|ted by having the &s;ame Countrey, or Faith, or Di&s;ci|pline; &s;o much the more intimate ought to be their U|nion, who have all the&s;e things in common; provided always, that we take care, if we meet with any with whom we cannot agree in all things, yet we be &s;till rea|dy to agree with them as far as we can; following
<PB N="7" REF="9">
herein the Apo&s;tle's Rule, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3. 16.</NOTE><HI>Neverthele&s;s whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the &s;ame Rule; let us mind the &s;ame thing:</HI> And then 'tis to be hoped, that at la&s;t, <HI>if in any thing we be otherwi&s;e minded, God &s;hall even reveal this unto us.</HI></P>
<P>That there are &s;ome, even among tho&s;e who call them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> unworthy of <HI>Peace,</HI> the Holy Scriptures inform us: And the&s;e the Apo&s;tle, both by Precept and Example, orders to be ca&s;t out of the Church. Such, for In&s;tance, are they who deny the Fundamental Articles of our Faith, or who openly allow of Practices contrary to the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion. Of the former kind, were <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2. 18.</NOTE> who oppo&s;ed the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection; and whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf <HI>delivered unto Satan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1. 20.</NOTE> that by being cha|&s;tiz'd, <HI>they might learn not to bla&s;pheme.</HI> Of the Latter, was that <HI>Corinthian</HI> Teacher, who was guilty of Ince&s;t, whom the Apo&s;tle ordered to be puni&s;hed after the &s;ame manner. <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 5. 5. 13.</NOTE><HI>Let &s;uch an one</HI> (I &s;ay) <HI>be delivered unto Satan for the de&s;truction of the Fle&s;h, that the Spirit may be &s;aved in the Day of the Lord Je&s;us; therefore put away from among your &s;elves that wicked Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>We have too many of &s;uch Chri&s;tians, fal&s;ely &s;o called, among our &s;elves who not only deny the Re&s;urrection of the Fle&s;h but even that Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h: who do not acknowledge <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> the One True God of the Chri&s;tians, in who&s;e Name we were bap|tized. Some we have, who take away the Merits and Satisfaction of our Saviour: and others, who pretend their own are equal to his. On one &s;ide we meet with tho&s;e that reject the Authority of the Scriptures; on the other, with tho&s;e that make their own Traditions equal with them, and impo&s;e upon us their private Fictions of Purgatory, wor&s;hipping of Saints and I|mages,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
and the Infallibility of the Pope, as Articles of Faith nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation. Nor is it any Wonder, that the <HI>Manners</HI> of the&s;e Men are like their <HI>Doctrines.</HI> Hence it is, that the Church of God has been either rent into Factions, or oppre&s;s'd by a Tyrannical Power; That Magi&s;trates have been dive&s;ted of their Authori|ty, tho' deriv'd to them from God him&s;elf: That the Innocent have been exil'd, tortur'd and put to death: And la&s;tly, that at the Will and Plea&s;ure of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> Kings have been depos'd, the People robb'd of their Laws and E&s;tates, and at la&s;t ma&s;&s;acred. But &s;uch Doctrines and &s;uch Practices can never belong to the Church of God: Nor can any Peace be ob&s;erved with tho&s;e who teach and avow &s;uch things; but the utmo&s;t Care ought to be taken, that the Peace of the Church be not de&s;troyed by their Contrivan|ces.</P>
<P>I own indeed, that a Chri&s;tian Charity is to be ex|ercis'd even towards the&s;e Men, how little &s;oever they may de&s;erve it: and that all Methods ought to be us'd to bring them to a better Mind. 'Tis the part of a good-natur'd Man, and a Chri&s;tian Pa&s;tor, to convince &s;uch Per&s;ons of their Error, to repre&s;ent the Danger they are in, and to admoni&s;h, exhort and be&s;eech them to return into the right way. And &s;uch of them, who through an invincible Ignorance, or the Prejudice of Education, or the Craftine&s;s of their Teachers, have been &s;o far &s;educ'd, as to do they know not what, may lay claim to a gentler &s;ort of U&s;age. Herein we fol|low the Rule pre&s;cribed us by St. <HI>Jude,</HI> while <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jud. v. 23.</NOTE><HI>we &s;ave them with Fear, plucking them out of the Fire,</HI> tho' <HI>hating even the Garment &s;potted by the Fle&s;h.</HI> Nor is it to be denied, but that a Man, who is a true Chri&s;ti|an, may in &s;ome Ca&s;es act in Conjunction with the Ene|mies
<PB N="9" REF="11">
of his Religion: as for In&s;tance, in Trade, Civil Offices, the Defence of ones Countrey, and the like: Neither will it be unbecoming us to carry our &s;elves peaceably towards them in common Conver&s;ation and the Affairs of this Life; for this will make them &s;en&s;i|ble, that the Rea&s;on why we differ from them in Mat|ters of Religion, is the Obligation of Con&s;cience, and not a Humour of Oppo&s;ition. However, they are to be excluded from the Communion of our Church, from partaking with us in our Sacraments, and from joining with us in our Publick Prayers; For neither our Temples, nor the Wor&s;hip of God, are to be prophaned by the Enemies of our Religion: According to that Precept of the Apo&s;tle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 6. 14. 15.</NOTE><HI>Be ye not unequally yok'd toge|ther with Unbelievers: for what Fellow&s;hip hath Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s with Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? and what Communion hath Light with Darkne&s;s? And what Concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel?</HI></P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle therefore does not admoni&s;h us to <HI>follow Peace</HI> with tho&s;e that &s;ubvert either the <HI>Faith</HI> or <HI>Man|ners</HI> of Chri&s;tians; but with &s;uch, who, agreeing with Us in the Fundamentals of Religion, are of different Opinions from us in other Matters of le&s;&s;er moment. With the&s;e he per&s;wades us to maintain as &s;trict an U|nion as po&s;&s;ible, and not to divide into Parties, but to &s;tand by one another in a mutual Defence again&s;t the common Enemies of Chri&s;tianity. He informs us, that &s;uch weak Per&s;ons as the&s;e, are to be e&s;teemed as Bre|thren; and that provided the Sub&s;tance of Religion be &s;ecured, we &s;hould not give way to Pa&s;&s;ion and Di&s;&s;en|tion, upon the Account of &s;ome trivial Differences in Opinions.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12">
But becau&s;e (as was hinted before) in the &s;ame Church, &s;ome may happen to be united to others with more and clo&s;er Ties than ordinary, we are to con&s;ider what &s;ort of Peace is to be kept, according to the Va|riety of the &s;everal Per&s;ons, with whom it is to be maintained.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the fir&s;t place then, it certainly becomes <HI>Us,</HI> who are <HI>Pa&s;tors of the &s;ame Flock,</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters attending at the &s;ame Altar,</HI> not only to be united together by the Bonds of <HI>Peace,</HI> but by the clo&s;e&s;t Ties of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Affection.</HI> By this means we &s;hall be the more firm and con&s;tant in oppo&s;ing the Enemies of our Religion and Function; and teach our re&s;pective Flocks to demean them&s;elves after the &s;ame manner towards All of us, as we behave our &s;elves towards one another. For what Thoughts would an Athei&s;t, or an Infidel, or a weaker Chri&s;tian have of the whole Body of the Clergy, if there &s;hould &s;carce be found one among them famous for his Writings, his Dignity, or the Po&s;t he holds in the Church, whom &s;ome of his Equals do not charge with Ignorance, Craft, or Impiety? And how can it be ex|pected that the People &s;hould e&s;teem us as Pious and Faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s we our &s;elves, who, 'tis rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, &s;hould know one another be&s;t, te&s;tifie to the World, both by Word and Deed, that we have really the &s;ame Thoughts of one another.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England,</HI> by the &s;pecial Providence of God, has a double Advantage, which the Unhappine&s;s of the Times in the Beginning of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> de|nied to many of our Neighbours. The One, that <HI>Epi&s;|copacy</HI> is pre&s;erved among us; the Other, that our <HI>Or|dination</HI> is in all re&s;pects perfect, and handed down to us from the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> them&s;elves. To te&s;tifie how much
<PB N="11" REF="13">
we prize the former Advantage, let us honour, re&s;pect, and obey our Bi&s;hops; and that they may govern and protect us with the Affection of <HI>Fathers,</HI> let us behave our &s;elves towards them with the Affection and Duty of <HI>Sons.</HI> If (as it &s;ometimes happens in Human Affairs) we &s;hould engage in any Controver&s;ie with them, let us beware, le&s;t by any undecent Reflections on their <HI>Per|&s;ons,</HI> we vilifie their <HI>Order;</HI> bearing all due Re&s;pect to the Dignity of their Station, and being fully per&s;wa|ded, that whatever Di&s;grace is ca&s;t upon the <HI>Fathers,</HI> will reflect upon the <HI>Sons.</HI></P>
<P>And that the Chri&s;tian World may perceive how high|ly we value our <HI>Ordination,</HI> let us honour and e&s;teem all tho&s;e, who have received the &s;ame Holy Orders with our &s;elves: Let us imitate our Ance&s;tors, on whom the Apo&s;tles laid their Hands; and let us be animated by the &s;ame Spirit of mutual Love with which they were, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12. 10.</NOTE><HI>being kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly Love, in honour preferring one another,</HI> as St. <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;|&s;es him&s;elf. So long as we all preach &s;ound Doctrine, let us neither envy nor cen&s;ure tho&s;e, who do it either more or le&s;s dexterou&s;ly than our &s;elves: Nor let us ac|count him as an Enemy, who, when his Belief of what God has revealed to us, be the &s;ame with ours, yet is not &s;o happy as to explain him&s;elf exactly in the &s;ame Terms with us. But above all things, this Caution is more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary, That when we engage in any Controver&s;ie in Divinity, we do not come to it with exa&s;|perated Minds: If any Doubts ari&s;e, let them be &s;eriou&s;ly weighed, accurately di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, &s;olidly handled; and let Truth be e&s;tabli&s;hed by Dint of Argument, not by opprobrious Language.

Both to con&s;ider, that being Members of a well regu|lated Church, they ought to lay a&s;ide all Contention and Reflections, and leave the Point in que&s;tion to be examined and determined by their Superiours. In do|ing thus, we &s;hall follow the Apo&s;tle's Advice: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 29. 31.</NOTE><HI>Let no Corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth, but that which is good to the u&s;e of Edifying.</HI>&mdash;And again, <HI>Let all Bitterne&s;s, and Wrath, and Clamour, and Evil|&s;peaking be put away from you, with all Malice.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. For the maintaining &s;incere Peace among all tho&s;e, who profe&s;s them&s;elves Sons of our Church, it is nece&s;&s;a|ry that they, as Members of the &s;ame Body, &s;hould be &s;o intimately united, as both to join with their Pa|&s;tors, and with one another, as well in the Publick Wor&s;hip, as in Brotherly Love. True it is, that the Variety of Cu&s;toms, the &s;everal Ways of Living, the particular Con&s;titution of our Bodies, and the like, do occa&s;ion Variety of Opinions, and different Modes of Acting in divers In&s;tances. One is for leading a Life of Au&s;terity, whil&s;t another thinks, that he may take his Freedom in tho&s;e things that are innocent. Some are for the Exerci&s;e of a &s;everer Di&s;cipline towards Offenders, whil&s;t others would have gentler Methods to be applied. Some are of Opinion, that it would be be&s;t for the Security of the Church, if tho&s;e things that are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed already, remain as they are; and tho&s;e Per&s;ons be kept at a di&s;tance from her, who are not fully &s;ati&s;|fied in every Particular: Whil&s;t others, on the contrary, think it more advi&s;eable, that things &s;hould be varied, according to the Diver&s;ity of Times and Occa&s;ions; That &s;ome Allowances &s;hould be made to Mens Prejudi|ces; and that the Terms of Communion &s;hould be enlar|ged for the Reception of Weaker Brethren into the Bo&s;om

of the Church. But in the&s;e and &s;uch like In&s;tances which are Matters of <HI>Prudence,</HI> rather than <HI>Religion,</HI> we may ea&s;ily bear with one another, whil&s;t we all hold the &s;ame Faith, and all make u&s;e of the &s;ame Prayers, Sacraments, Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline. The Church is but little beholden to tho&s;e Men, who are for excluding out of it All, that cannot in every thing think as they do; and look upon them as Enemies, who are not Friends ju&s;t in their own way. Be&s;ides, there are many things, which God has not been pleas'd to reveal to us: Several others, which perhaps it is our Intere&s;t to be Ignorant of; and &s;ome &s;till, wherein we have no Concern on which &s;ide the Truth lies. In &s;uch ca&s;es, if Men differ in their Opinions, it is not to be won|der'd at, nor ought any Offence to be taken from thence. Such Varieties of Opinions &s;hould not divide us into Sects and Parties; for the Church &s;uffers no real detriment by them. They &s;eem to be too fond of Quar|relling, who upon the Account of &s;uch trivial Matters, violate Brotherly Love and Chri&s;tian Communion.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are many <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Churches <HI>Abroad,</HI> who hold the &s;ame Fundamental Articles of Faith as we do, tho' they make u&s;e of different Ceremonies and Di&s;ci|pline: It were to be wi&s;h'd, that they were better united among them&s;elves, and that All of them were in a clo&s;er Union with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than hither|to they have been; that &s;o, tho' di&s;tant one from ano|ther in Place, and differing in &s;ome things, yet they might be truly joyn'd together in Chri&s;tian Peace and Communion. It is indeed to be own'd, that &s;ome of the&s;e might rectifie their Sentiments in particular In|&s;tances; and 'tis matter of great concern, that &s;ome others of them are &s;o unhappy as to want that <HI>Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="16">
<HI>Hierarchy,</HI> which has flouri&s;h'd down from the Apo&s;tle's Times: Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that they commonly decline Communion with one another, and if at any time the Members of tho&s;e Churches happen, in the &s;ame Places, to meet with the Members of our Church, they do not, without &s;ome Difficulty, join to|gether in the &s;ame External Wor&s;hip. And hence ari&s;es that Alienation of Affections, that Di&s;union of Strength, and that un&s;teady Friend&s;hip which is to be ob&s;erved among <HI>Prote&s;tants.</HI> It would certainly be worth our while, and perhaps not unworthy the Thoughts of this Holy Synod, to con&s;ider how we might all become One Body. But by what Means this might be effected, what Abatements or Allowances in order thereunto might be made on either Side, is not Mine, nor any private Man's Province to determine; only thus much we may be allow'd to wi&s;h, that for the Honour of the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and the &s;afety of the <HI>Reform'd</HI> Religion, &s;uch an Union may &s;ome time be brought about, and that God in his Mercy would teach all the <HI>Prote&s;tant Churches</HI> in general, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. xix. 42.</NOTE><HI>to know at lea&s;t in this their Day, the things that belong to their</HI> mutual <HI>Peace before they be hid from their Eyes;</HI> that &s;o at length that Reproach may be remov'd, which is &s;o often ca&s;t upon us by the <HI>Romani&s;ts,</HI> of our not being the <HI>Sons of Peace,</HI> who cannot tell how to agree even among our &s;elves; and that other Means proving ineffectual, we may at la&s;t be in&s;tructed by our Misfortunes, with Brotherly Love, and united Force to defend one ano|ther again&s;t the Subtilty and Power of the Common Enemy; or if at any time (which God prevent) the &s;ame Calamity &s;hould overtake any other of the Refor|med Churches, which has in our days befal'n the <HI>French,</HI> that in &s;uch ca&s;e the Di&s;pers'd and Exil'd Brethren,

<P N="4">4. But the mo&s;t difficult Que&s;tion is &s;till behind, <HI>viz.</HI> What &s;ort of Peace is to be maintain'd with tho&s;e, who having the &s;ame Country, Laws, and Religion in com|mon with us, yet for &s;ome Rea&s;ons (not proper to be enquired into at pre&s;ent) are di&s;&s;atisfied with our <HI>Di&s;ci|pline</HI> or our <HI>Liturgy,</HI> and upon that account divide into Parties, choo&s;e them&s;elves Pa&s;tors, and form them&s;elves into &s;eparate Communions. Their Ca&s;e is different from that of the <HI>Foreign Prote&s;tants;</HI> the&s;e Latter would have been glad of our Church Government, if they could have had it; at lea&s;t they do not condemn it; they are at liberty to u&s;e their own Cu&s;toms and Ceremo|nies; whil&s;t the Former withdraw them&s;elves from the Pa&s;tors of their own Church, and oppo&s;e that Di&s;ci|pline which is e&s;tabli&s;hed by Lawful Authority.</P>
<P>We do indeed maintain &s;ome &s;ort of Peace with the&s;e; for no open War or Per&s;ecution is carry'd on again&s;t them: And herein the truly laudable Charity and Moderation of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> is made ma|nife&s;t to the Chri&s;tian World; that con&s;tant Pains are taken, by Preaching, Writing, and Conference, to &s;a|tisfie the Weaker of them: And Matters are manag'd with &s;o much Gentlene&s;s towards our <HI>Di&s;&s;enting Brethren</HI> that without exa&s;perating their Minds, we chu&s;e rather to gain them over into a willing Compliance with <HI>the Meekne&s;s of Wi&s;dom;</HI> and yet there are &s;till remain|ing &s;eparate Congregations, di&s;tinct Pa&s;tors, and a dif|ferent &s;ort of Di&s;cipline.

Let us therefore put up our Con&s;tant Pe|titions to the Father of Lights, that he would at la&s;t vouch&s;afe to open their Eyes, that they may &s;ee what a gro&s;s Error they lie under, with what a deep Wound they tear and weaken the Church, and what encou|ragement they give to our Common Enemies, by their Separation.</P>
<P>Nor ought we to de&s;pair, but &s;till to add our farther Endeavours, that, at one time or other, this &s;o Pious and Beneficial a De&s;ign may be accompli&s;h'd: The happy Day may come, which may produce what an Age has deny'd us; and at la&s;t a Way be open'd to us, whereby we may &s;atisfie the Scruples of the Di&s;&s;enters, without prejudicing the Doctrine, Authority, or Di&s;cipline of the Church; and they may return into the Bo&s;om of their Mother, after too long an Alienation from her: Than which, nothing certainly could be more de&s;irable to a Chri&s;tian, or more fortunate to this Church: Then we &s;hould have perfect and entire Peace among our &s;elves, which is at pre&s;ent &s;o lamentably broken and di&s;turb'd by &s;eparate A&s;&s;emblies, and mutual Jealou|&s;ies.</P>
<P>It is not my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire, by what Methods this mo&s;t de&s;irable Peace may be obtain'd: This is to be left to the Piety and Prudence of this Venerable Synod, under the Divine Conduct of the Spirit of Peace, and the Author of Concord, when|ever they &s;hall think fit to enter upon the Con&s;idera|tion of the&s;e weighty Concerns. Having thus &s;hewn what &s;ort of Peace is to be follow'd, and with whom; all that remains under this Head, is to excite you to

a vigorous Pro&s;ecution of it: which I cannot do better, than by de&s;iring you, according to my propo&s;ed Me|thod,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P>II. To ob&s;erve of what great Moment this <HI>Peace</HI> is to us, our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd. Now 'tis of &s;o great Moment, that almo&s;t the Whole of Reli|gion depends upon it; nor can it rationally be ex|pected, according to the pre&s;ent State of Affairs, that we &s;hould long have any Church at all, but by the means of Unity and Peace. For the confirmation of this, among many other Arguments, which the time does not permit me to run through, I &s;hall only pro|duce the&s;e Four.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> mo&s;t implacable to Prote|&s;tants, has never &s;hewn her &s;elf more eager, in con|triving our Ruin, both by &s;ecret Con&s;piracies, and open Force, than at this time. I need not tell you what Fury it has exercis'd again&s;t Some, nor what Arts it makes u&s;e of again&s;t Others of the <HI>Reformed Churches;</HI> the&s;e things are but too manife&s;t to every one who reads any thing of the Tran&s;actions of <HI>Europe.</HI> In <HI>France,</HI> in <HI>Bearne,</HI> and in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> the very Name of <HI>Prote|&s;tant</HI> is almo&s;t extinct; every Day we hear of many in tho&s;e Places condemn'd to Pri&s;ons, to Gallies, and to Tortures; the re&s;t who have made their E&s;cape, are reduc'd to live upon Charity, and compell'd to &s;eek new Places of Abode, either here or el&s;ewhere. Nor are we ignorant of the Danger which threatens the Pro|te&s;tants of the <HI>Palatinate, Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;ylvania:</HI> By the&s;e Di&s;a&s;ters we have lo&s;t Some of the Reformed Churches, and from the&s;e Dangers we are in fear for Others. And if once the Ruin of tho&s;e Remoter
<PB N="18" REF="20">
Churches &s;hall be totally accompli&s;h'd, This of ours will become an ea&s;ie Prey to the Tyranny of <HI>Rome:</HI> Nor can we otherwi&s;e be &s;afe, unle&s;s with united Force we make &s;o vigorous an Oppo&s;ition, as to let our Ene|mies know, that, whil&s;t they exerci&s;e their Cruelty to|wards our Brethren, we look upon it as if done to our &s;elves.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a <HI>Peace</HI> and intimate Union among <HI>Prote|&s;tants</HI> is highly nece&s;&s;ary, is what hardly any one can be in&s;en&s;ible of; but &s;ome perhaps will be apt to &s;u|&s;pect, that now 'tis too late: and &s;o it is to be fear'd it will be, if in &s;uch a weighty Concern we do not take &s;ome early Care. Let us then be prevail'd upon, with|out delay, to do our Part towards the attaining of this End, that by being at Peace among our &s;elves, we may open a Way to an <HI>Univer&s;al Peace.</HI> If ever, by the Providence of God, the Churches Abroad &s;hould unite, one may very fairly &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch a Thing would hardly be done, but by the Mediation of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> but how &s;hall others make u&s;e of our Coun|&s;els for the Compo&s;ing their Differences, if we can find out no Remedy to our own? <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. v. 14, 15.</NOTE><HI>All the Law,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, and all our Safety, <HI>is fulfilled in one Word, Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf: but if,</HI> in&s;tead of mutual Love, <HI>we bite and devour one another, let us take heed, that we be not con&s;umed one of another,</HI> and all of us together by our Common Enemy. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matt. xii. 25.</NOTE><HI>For every Kingdom divided again&s;t it &s;elf, is brought to De&s;o|lation; and every City or Hou&s;e divided again&s;t it &s;elf &s;hall not &s;tand.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Faith</HI> it &s;elf is endanger'd by mutual Conten|tions; and whil&s;t warm Debates, and angry Di&s;putes are carry'd on among Brethren about the Punctilio's of
<PB N="19" REF="21">
Religion, the Blow really, tho' not de&s;ignedly, falls up|on Religion it &s;elf. It often happens, that they who believe one and the &s;ame Article of Faith, do differ in their manner of explaining it; and whil&s;t Both are pleas'd with their own Explanation, One contends that it cannot be True in the others way of Expre&s;&s;ing it, and the other, that it mu&s;t be true his way or not at all; in the mean time, the Enemies of Religion, bor|rowing Arguments from each Party, do infer, that it mu&s;t be certainly Fal&s;e, and cannot be at all. Thus whil&s;t &s;ome contend about the Shadow, they occa&s;ion others to lo&s;e the Sub&s;tance. It would certainly be much better, when the Sub&s;tance of our Doctrine is the &s;ame, to be le&s;s &s;olicitous about other Matters; for whil&s;t we are agreed in tho&s;e things, which God him&s;elf teaches, it is not becoming either a Mode&s;t Man, or a Chri&s;tian, to contend eagerly about his own Illu&s;trations. Let the Enemies of our Faith rather perceive, that we aim not at our Own, but at the Glory of God; and that we never fall out with tho&s;e, who, together with our &s;elves, embrace the Scripture Revelation, upon the ac|count of our own private Opinions.</P>
<P>But from the&s;e Contentions, if they happen among Pa&s;tors them&s;elves, a farther danger ari&s;es to the Faith: For we know that Religion is planted, increa&s;es, and flouri&s;hes by their Care and Labours; and that the greater e&s;teem Men have for them, the more ea&s;ily will they be per&s;waded by them: Now if they them|&s;elves charge each other with Ignorance and Error, what el&s;e can be the I&s;&s;ue, but that the People mov'd by the&s;e Reflections, will de&s;pi&s;e or hate them, and by degrees fall from de&s;pi&s;ing the Pa&s;tor, to contemn Re|ligion it &s;elf? It would certainly be more advi&s;eable, for Both Sides to con&s;ult their Mutual Honour and Re|putation;
<PB N="20" REF="22">
and if there &s;hould be a Mi&s;take in any ca&s;e, to conceal it rather, than by expo&s;ing the Weakne&s;s of particular Per&s;ons, to fru&s;trate the Succe&s;s of their com|mon Endeavours.</P>
<P N="3">3. Unle&s;s we maintain <HI>Peace,</HI> farewel to Di&s;cipline and Good-Manners, without which the Church can|not &s;tand long; for whil&s;t Factions prevail, Ju&s;tice, for fear it &s;hould &s;eem to be &s;everer on one &s;ide than the other, is apt to proceed too timerou&s;ly; and ill Men either conceal their Vices in the Mi&s;t of Contention, or if they be too manife&s;t to be conceal'd, then they &s;hel|ter 'em by their Zeal for one of the contending Parties. Whil&s;t the Quarrel on both Sides is manag'd with an immoderate Heat, neither Party examines of what Life or Faith the Men of their own Side are, but only how they &s;tand affected towards the Party: Nor is there any concern, whether they be Good Men or no, but only whether they be on our Side. But if the&s;e Con|tentions are heighten'd into Schi&s;ms, the Ca&s;e is &s;till wor&s;e, for then the wor&s;t of Men, even the Corrupters of our Faith and Manners, by leaving one Communion for another, as occa&s;ion &s;erves, equally e&s;cape the Cen|&s;ure of all. But what &s;ort of Manners can we expect where there is no Di&s;cipline? and what &s;ort of Face is the Church like to have, when 'tis &s;tain'd with corrupt Manners? How valuable &s;oever a pure Faith is, yet a pure Life will be always brighter, and more e&s;teem'd. Vices pollute the Soil in which they grow, nor will any Church pre&s;erve its Honour, who&s;e Members are <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> by <HI>Name,</HI> but <HI>Infidels</HI> in <HI>Practice.</HI> Peace therefore is to be follow'd, that we may pro&s;ecute Vice; and Friend&s;hip maintain'd among Good Men, that we may turn our whole Force again&s;t Impiety, an Enemy
<PB N="21" REF="23">
both to the Salvation of our Souls, and to the Peace of the Church. For neither can a Church flouri&s;h or be &s;ecure, unle&s;s Care be taken of Mens Manners, nor can there be any Regulation of Manners, unle&s;s Peace be pre|&s;erv'd.</P>
<P N="4">4. By the Lo&s;s of <HI>Peace,</HI> we, together with it, lo&s;e <HI>Edification:</HI> For there is no room for Per&s;wa&s;ion in the mid&s;t of Heat and Pa&s;&s;ion: Nor do tho&s;e, who&s;e Minds are po&s;&s;e&s;t with the Prejudices of contending Parties, ea&s;ily attend to him that preaches Faith in Chri&s;t, or Piety towards God, or the Love of Vertue. When Pa&s;&s;ion is laid, the Under&s;tanding is more apt to re|ceive the Truth, and the Will is the more ea&s;ily moved by the weight of Arguments. If one &s;ide is angry, &s;o is the other; nor does either of them con&s;ider what becomes Them&s;elves, but what may prejudice their Ad|ver&s;aries. There is therefore need of Peace, both for the Planting Faith in our Minds, and al&s;o for promo|ting the Fruits of Faith, Integrity of Life, and the Care of our Souls. Conformable to this, is what we meet with in Scripture, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. ix. 31.</NOTE><HI>Then had the Churches re&s;t throughout all</HI> Judea, <HI>and</HI> Galilee, <HI>and</HI> Samaria, <HI>and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t were multiplied.</HI> Whil&s;t we enjoy the Gentle Gale of Peace, Unbelievers are ea&s;ily per&s;waded to embark in the &s;ame Bottom with us; if we are driven to and fro by our Differen|ces, they had rather be at quiet in their own Errors, than be to&s;s'd about by our Contentions. Nor can the Church it &s;elf, in the mid&s;t of perpetual Storms, hold out always again&s;t the Violence of the Waves: It mu&s;t &s;ometimes come into Port to refit; it will want frequent Repair, to &s;ecure it from Shipwreck; and the Care and Vigilance of the <HI>Builder</HI> mu&s;t be con&s;tantly
<PB N="22" REF="24">
employed for its Safety and Pre&s;ervation. And this brings me to the other General Head of my Di&s;|cour&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> To treat of the <HI>Edification</HI> of the Church.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<P>II. This <HI>Edification</HI> has a regard to two things, <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> both of them ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our Salvation. We have already &s;een, that whil&s;t we follow Peace, we take the wi&s;e&s;t Cour&s;e to &s;ecure both our <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Manners;</HI> but it &s;till remains un|der this Head of <HI>Edification,</HI> that we enquire, how much it is our Intere&s;t to take care of the&s;e things, and by what other Methods they may be pre&s;erv'd and maintained.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="subsection">
<P>I. As to <HI>Faith,</HI> the more it is in Danger, the great|er Care ought to be taken of it: But hardly, in any Age of the Church have we heard of more Shipwrecks made of the Faith, than are to be &s;een in our Days. To call in que&s;tion the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, to throw a&s;ide all Revelation as a Cheat; nay, to deny the Exi&s;tence of God, or, which amounts to the &s;ame thing, to di&s;own his Providence; is grown &s;o fa&s;hiona|ble, that tho&s;e who openly do &s;o, are no longer (as for|merly they were) looked upon as Mon&s;ters. That on|ly is reckoned Liberty, to think, not what is mo&s;t pro|bable, but what every one has the mo&s;t mind to. E|very Man &s;ets up his own private Opinion for his Reli|gion; and 'tis reckoned a Meanne&s;s of Spirit to &s;uffer ones &s;elf to be directed by the Word of God, and the Light of Revelation.</P>

<P>For the more remi&s;s we are in defending the <HI>Faith,</HI> the more will the Enemies and Corrupters of our Re|ligion exalt them&s;elves; the more &s;ecurely will Satan, the Betrayer of Man's Salvation, &s;ow his Tares in the Field of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and it may be at la&s;t ju&s;t with God, in Judgment to take away from us that Faith, which we have been &s;o negligent in keeping; and the Light of the Go&s;pel being removed, to &s;uffer this ungrateful Nation to fall back again into the Darkne&s;s of <HI>Infide|lity</HI> or <HI>Popery.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. We &s;hould take care, as far as in us lies, to encou|rage the &s;etting up of Schools, wherein the Poorer Youth may be taught to read the Bible, and to un|der&s;tand the fir&s;t Rudiments of Religion, and to retain them in their Memory.</P>
<P N="5">5. That tho&s;e of riper Years be more fully in&s;tru|cted, in order to their being confirmed by the Benedi|ction of the Bi&s;hop, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 3. 15.</NOTE><HI>That they may be ready always to give an An&s;wer to every Man that asketh them a Rea|&s;on of the Hope that is in them:</HI> And that they may not for want of a &s;olid Foundation, be born down by the Attempts of Deceivers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4. 14.</NOTE><HI>nor be any more Children to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Do|ctrine, by the &s;light of Men, and cunning Craftine&s;s, where|by they lie in wait to deceive.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27">
And all the&s;e things, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, are generally practi&s;ed among us, both to the Good of Souls, and the Honour of this Church. One thing is &s;till to be wi&s;h'd (and how it might be obtained, I leave to the Judgment and Prudence of my Superi|ours,) <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;ome Method may be found out, whereby all tho&s;e who are Eminent for their Birth, Station or Wealth, may be obliged to in&s;till betimes the&s;e important Matters into the Minds of their Chil|dren, and to in&s;truct them throughly, as they grow up, in the Chri&s;tian Religion; to teach them what the Articles of our Faith are, on what Foundations they are built, and by what Arguments defended a|gain&s;t Athei&s;ts, Hereticks and Infidels. For the Ri&s;e and Growth of our Misfortune is chiefly owing to this, that the&s;e young Gentlemen (except &s;ome few, on whom the Care of their Parents, or the Di&s;cipline of an Univer&s;ity, be&s;tow a more happy Education) neg|lecting the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, conform them&s;elves to the Manners of the Age; and being furni&s;hed with a little humane Learning, or rendred more confident by a Smattering in Philo&s;ophy, think it genteel to doubt of Sacred Truths, to laugh at Reve|lation, and to form each for him&s;elf a new, or no Reli|gion, as the Fancy takes him. From the&s;e the Infe|ction de&s;cends to the People; for they are the Per|&s;ons, whom when <HI>young,</HI> tho&s;e of the &s;ame Age imitate, and whom when <HI>grown up,</HI> All Men make their court to. God grant that &s;ome &s;uitable Remedy may be applied to this Unhappine&s;s; that Religion may not be run down chiefly by tho&s;e, who are more indebted to God than others, by who&s;e Authority the Vulgar ought to
<PB N="26" REF="28">
be kept within the Bounds of their Duty, and by who&s;e Example they &s;hould be taught to lead regu|lar Lives, and to reverence things Sacred.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="subsection">
<P>II. The Second, and withal the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Part of <HI>Edification,</HI> is that which relates to <HI>Manners.</HI> For let our Faith be never &s;o Sound and Orthodox, if in our Manners we act counter thereto, our Church will never be e&s;teemed as truly Chri&s;tian. All Men cannot pretend to judge of Opinions; but all may be Judges of our Lives. The wi&s;er &s;ort may perhaps come over to us for the &s;ake of Truth; but to win over the Vulgar, we mu&s;t adorn the Purity of our Doctrine by Integrity of Life. 'Tis true indeed, in the Reformation of Manners, we are to &s;truggle with a very corrupt Age: But the more corrupt the Age is, the more Occa&s;ion is there for us to endeavour in the fir&s;t Place, that things may not grow wor&s;e; and then, that they may alter for the better. Nor can we be&s;tow our Pains on a Work more accepta|ble to God, more becoming our &s;elves, or more be|neficial to our Flocks. The Church of <HI>England</HI> was reformed by our Ance&s;tors from the Corruptions of <HI>Popery</HI> in Matters of <HI>Faith.</HI> How much will it be for our Glory, to be in&s;trumental in tran&s;mitting it down to Po&s;terity, purg'd at la&s;t from a <HI>Practice</HI> un|&s;uitable to its <HI>Doctrine!</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>But that the&s;e our Attempts may meet with a happy I&s;&s;ue, Endeavours ought to be u&s;ed,</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline</HI> may be re&s;tored; that we may obtain this Favour at lea&s;t of the Se|cular
<PB N="27" REF="29">
Power, that they would not weaken, but ra|ther &s;trengthen our Hands, whil&s;t they are employed in promoting the Publick Safety. For the Corrupti|on which we labour under, both in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Man|ners,</HI> is to be imputed to the Lo&s;s of our Di&s;ci|pline.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we procure as far as may be, good Laws to be enacted again&s;t publick and &s;candalous Vices e&s;pecially; and that &s;uch Men may be afraid of the Civil Sword, who do not &s;tand in awe of the Cen|&s;ure of the Church.</P>
<P N="3">3. That Magi&s;trates be excited to add Life to the Laws already in force again&s;t ill Manners, by put|ting them into Execution; that they may not by their Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s &s;uffer Vice to grow head&s;trong, whil&s;t the Remedy grows weak.</P>
<P N="4">4. That we con&s;tantly &s;hew the People the Nece&s;&s;i|ty of a Holy Life, in our Di&s;cour&s;es, Writings, and Preaching; and fully convince them, that there is no hope of Pardon without a &s;incere Repentance; nor any way to Salvation, but by Holine&s;s of Life.</P>
<P>I &s;hall add only this one thing more, which is of the highe&s;t Importance; That the Clergy would by their Examples give Life and Strength to all the&s;e things, and &s;tir up the People committed to their Charge, by &s;hewing, that them&s;elves are concerned for the&s;e weighty Matters, not only in their Preach|ing, but in their Hearts and Practice. Nothing will

have a greater Influence upon the Common People to incline them to perform all the Parts of a good Life, <HI>Piety</HI> towards God, <HI>Obedience</HI> towards the King, <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> towards their Neighbours, and <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> towards them&s;elves, than the perceiving that all the&s;e Duties are not only re|commended by the Di&s;cour&s;es of their Pa&s;tors, but vi&s;ibly propo&s;ed to our Imitation in their Lives and A|ctions.</P>

<P>Let me therefore, <HI>Reverend Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren,</HI> Exhort you, I do not &s;ay, to do the&s;e things, for I am fully per&s;waded that this is your con&s;tant Practice; and I make no que&s;tion but your Flocks will readily acknowledge it: but rather that you would be earne&s;t in your Prayers to God, that all the&s;e things may be con&s;tantly and &s;tedfa&s;tly per|formed both by our &s;elves, and, through the Influ|ence of our Example, by the whole Body of the Clergy.</P>
<P N="1">1. That our <HI>Piety</HI> may be eminently con&s;picuous to our Flocks, through all the Parts of the Sacred Mini|&s;try; that in celebrating the Publick Prayers, in the Admini&s;tration of the Sacraments, in preaching the Word of God, and in all the other Divine Offices we may demean our &s;elves with &s;o much Care, Gravity, and Diligence, as may make it appear that we have al|ways God in our view, that we make his Glory our only Aim, and that as becomes faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, we look upon no Labour and Vigilancy too much, that is be&s;towed in the taking care of Souls.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="29" REF="31">
2. That we &s;till may pre&s;erve that Reputation of <HI>Loyalty</HI> towards our <HI>King,</HI> for which the Church of <HI>England</HI> has been &s;o famous throughout the whole World. We do not find in all our Hi&s;tory, that God ever ble&s;s'd us before with a Prince, who de&s;erv'd more of the Reform'd Religion in General, and of our Church in Particular. May there not be met with in the Annals of Po&s;terity, any In&s;tance of a more grate|ful and Dutiful Clergy. We are &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of the Envy of ill Men, and have found by Experience, that there are &s;ome who would have us pa&s;s for &s;u|&s;pected Per&s;ons, and &s;uch as have not a &s;teady affection for the Government: Let us, by an open-hearted Loy|alty and Obedience, &s;top the Mouths of the&s;e Malici|ous Per&s;ons, and let it appear, that they are only the Enemies of Religion it &s;elf, who calumniate the Mini|&s;ters of our Religion, as defective in their Love, Af|fection, and Duty to their Prince.</P>
<P N="3">3. That we may recommend <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Mutual Love</HI> to our People, it is to be wi&s;h'd, that we may always demean our &s;elves ju&s;tly and affectionately one towards another; that we who are <HI>Sons,</HI> may be ready to pay all due Obedience and Honour to our <HI>Fathers in Chri&s;t;</HI> and that the <HI>Fathers</HI> them&s;elves may not oppre&s;s tho&s;e who are under them, but govern them with Kindne&s;s and Lenity, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. v. 3.</NOTE><HI>Not as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being en&s;amples to the Flock:</HI> That if at any time it &s;hall happen, that we meet and con&s;ult together in one Body, Matters may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed calmly and de|liberately, without Noi&s;e or Clamour; and that it may be evident, that the &s;ole Good of the Church, not
<PB N="30" REF="32">
any private di&s;gu&s;t, does influence our Debates. And that whil&s;t we act &s;eparately in our ordinary Stations, we may always be &s;o far united in mutual Kindne&s;s, Affection, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, that our <HI>Hearts</HI> may con&s;pire in finding out, and our <HI>Hands</HI> be ready to join in executing, whatever conduces to the Honour of God, and the Salvation of Souls.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Let us be&s;eech God, that he would vouch|&s;afe to grant us All the &s;pecial Grace of his Holy Spi|rit, that Sobriety, Mode&s;ty, Temperance, and the Contempt of Worldly Things may &s;hine forth in us; that our Flocks may be convinced, that we are heartily &s;olicitous about our own Souls, and are not over-fond of this World, whil&s;t we preach to them of another to come, but that <NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 27.</NOTE><HI>We bring into Sub|jection our Bodies</HI> and De&s;ires <HI>le&s;t that by any Means when we have preached to others, we our &s;elves &s;hould be Ca&s;t-aways.</HI> Let us walk before them with &s;uch uprightne&s;s of Manners, and Sanctity of Life, that they may &s;ay, that <HI>God is in us of a Truth.</HI> Such Manners will give weight to our Sermons and Coun&s;els. By this Means, whatever we jointly decree, will carry its Authority; what-ever we pub|lickly Preach, will have its Force; and whatever private Admonitions we give, will be accompanied with a plea&s;ing &s;ort of Command over the Minds of Men. By &s;uch an Example as This, we &s;hall truly edifie the <HI>Church,</HI> render it flouri&s;hing in our Times, and durable to after-Ages; and every one of us, after the fini&s;hing of his Pious Labours in the Lord's Vineyard, &s;hall clo&s;e his Days with the &s;ame Con&s;olation wherewith our Holy Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI>
