<P>There lives not, &s;urely, on this globe, a wretch &s;o lo&s;t, &s;o totally forlorn, as I am. In one &s;ad moment depriv'd of friends and fame.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I am glad to &s;ee you any where, my dear Emily, this vi&s;it will evince; but, I confe&s;s, I am &s;urpriz'd at meeting you in &s;uch a place as this, when I, who have the honour of being &s;o nearly re|lated to you, am ma&s;ter of a hou&s;e in London. I think your billet &s;aid you were alone. I now ex|pect you will explain this my&s;tery, by other means than tears and blu&s;hes.&mdash;Pray &s;peak, and clear my doubts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Innocence &s;hou'd be bold, my lord; but maiden innocence is full of fear. Pray pardon my he&s;itation; I know not how, or where I &s;hall begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recollect your &s;pirits, and be a&s;&s;ur'd you &s;peak to one, who, to the utmo&s;t of his power, will prove a brother to you.&mdash;My &s;i&s;ters too, I'll an&s;wer for them, when once acquainted with your per&s;on and merit, will be your &s;i&s;ters al&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your kindne&s;s has encouraged me. Your lord&s;hip knows my mother died while I was yet an in|fant, and that my father married &s;oon again.&mdash;From that unhappy hour, I became an alien to his heart and per&s;on; under pretence of education, I was &s;ent to &s;chool, where I received the honour of your lord|&s;hip's frequent and friendly vi&s;its, and remain'd there 'till about two years &s;ince.&mdash;Wou'd I had never left it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>The taunts, the cruelties I met at home, are not to be de&s;crib'd. 'Till about &s;ix weeks &s;ince, there was a match propo&s;ed to me, with the mo&s;t dete&s;ta|ble of men which I, pro&s;trate at my father's feet, and bathing them with tears, refu&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He cou'd not &s;ure attempt to force your hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every argument was u&s;ed to per&s;uade, every threat to terrify me, into compliance, but in vain. During this time of per&s;ecution, my father's ill health obliged him to vi&s;it Bath; I was permitted to attend him, upon promi&s;ing to try to conquer my aver&s;ion to this hated marriage.&mdash;I promi&s;ed any thing, to gain a re&s;pite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you de&s;cribe your &s;ituation, I cannot blame you.&mdash;But was it aver&s;ion to the match pro|po&s;ed, or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;ome other object, that ruled your will? I beg you will be &s;incere. Your blu&s;hes an&s;wer me.&mdash;But go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean, my lord, to hide a &s;ingle thought; &s;incerity is the fair garb of virtue, and they who know no guilt, need no di&s;gui&s;e. At Bath, I
<PB N="5" REF="9">
met a gentleman, whom I had known at &s;chool, his &s;i&s;ter was my friend and favourite there, and, in my childi&s;h days, he u&s;ed to call him&s;elf my lover.&mdash;Even then I thought him, as &s;ure he is this moment, the mo&s;t amiable of his &s;ex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Emily, I begin to tremble for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>This gentleman renew'd his former court&s;hip, if I may be allow'd the term, while my fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ions recurr'd with added &s;trength. He a&s;ked me of my father, who ab&s;olutely refus'd, and forbad me ever to &s;ee him more&mdash;cruel, inhuman &s;entence!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was indeed &s;evere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I received a billet from him, reque&s;ting me to &s;ee him when the family were retired to re&s;t. My father had ordered every thing to be got ready for leaving Bath next day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you, of cour&s;e, con&s;ented to this la&s;t adieu?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>He came, and while he uttered the tendere&s;t vows of everla&s;ting love, we heard a noi&s;e in my clo&s;et, to which he flew, and, on forcing it open, to our mutual a&s;toni&s;hment, a gentleman ru&s;hed out. My dear, deceived, unhappy lover, called on him to draw; and, ca&s;ting a look of rage, mix'd with con|tempt, at me, &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Life is no longer worth my care, thy perfidy has made it hateful to me."</Q> I threw my&s;elf between their &s;words, and &s;cream'd &s;o loud, that it brought my father, and all the family, into the room. At &s;ight of him, my terror and con|fu&s;ion redoubled. I ran down &s;tairs into the &s;treet, without knowing whither I went, or what to do. The night coach was &s;etting off for London, at that moment; I got into it, without determining on any thing, but that I wou'd not return; and hither it has brought me.</P>

<P>Welcome to London, my dear Charles; but to what happy chance are we indebted for your return? I under&s;tood that you meant to pa&s;s a philo|&s;ophical &s;ummer, at your &s;eat in the we&s;t, in reading and retirement. But it grew dull, I &s;uppo&s;e; it wou'd not do, Sir Charles; tho' you have not made a very long trial of it, I think, neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not indeed, my lord, made the &s;malle&s;t attempt towards the rational &s;cheme you hint at. Thoughts of a very different nature have, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, wholly occupied my mind, and left no room for any thing be&s;ide, but friend&s;hip, and Lord Belmont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord Belmont is much yours. But from this &s;ententious &s;peech, and that grave countenance, I think I may, without being a conjuror, pronounce, that the gay and lively Sir Charles Somerville is on the point of matrimony with &s;ome well-jointur'd widow, or rich heire&s;s; and that he is, at this very moment, making an exact calculation of the fortune he &s;hall allot to his &s;eventh &s;on, by, and of that mar|riage lawfully begotten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your lord&s;hip was never more mi&s;taken.&mdash;So far from it, that I have bid adieu to the whole &s;ex, and am determin'd to quit England, in a few days, with a firm purpo&s;e never to revi&s;it it. <STAGE>[A loud &s;igh heard from the clo&s;et.]</STAGE> Ha! whence cou'd that &s;igh proceed?</P>

<P>Sir Charles, I beg a thou&s;and pardons, but I mu&s;t entreat you to withdraw immediately, and re|que&s;t the plea&s;ure of meeting you at my hou&s;e, in half an hour.</P>

<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not alarmed, my lord, the clo&s;ene&s;s of the place overcame my &s;pirits; I &s;hall recover &s;oon: but is Sir Charles re&s;olv'd then? does he leave England immediately? what have I &s;aid! I mean, my lord, is the gentleman quite gone? is there no fear of his re|turning? one is apt to rave after fainting, you know, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is method in your madne&s;s, Emily; but tho' I dare &s;ay you did not mean to tru&s;t me with the name of your lover, be a&s;&s;ured I am extremely pleas'd at di&s;covering him in the per&s;on of my friend Sir Charles Somerville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is, indeed, my lord, the object of my hopes, and my de&s;pair; but to what purpo&s;e do I own my pa&s;&s;ion? he quits his native land, to fly from me!</P>
</SP>

<P>Mo&s;t willingly, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The way to hope for candour from Somer|ville, the world, and me, is by a frank confe&s;&s;ion. Who was that gentleman he found concealed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all my hopes of candour from the world, of e&s;teem from you, and love from Somerville, I know him not; nor why, or wherefore he came thi|ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mu&s;t believe you, Emily; there is a charm in truth, that &s;trikes upon the mind, like light upon our eyes.&mdash;'Tis irre&s;i&s;tible. Yet pa&s;&s;ion, I will grant, may ca&s;t a veil on either; I therefore can ex|cu&s;e Sir Charles for judging wrong.</P>

<P>Oh! blame him not, my lord, appearances were &s;trong again&s;t me; but while we talk, he flies.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your fears are tho&s;e of love, but let them re&s;t; and be a&s;&s;ur'd he &s;hall not break the double toil, that love and friend&s;hip &s;pread to hold him fa&s;t. But come, my Emily, I am impatient 'till I place you in a fitter &s;ituation, and pre&s;ent you to my &s;i&s;ters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, my lord; think how improper it would be for me to appear in your hou&s;e, or any where in my own character, 'till time &s;hall have un|ravell'd this cruel my&s;tery. Scandal has as many wings as tongues, and in a few hours, I may expect to be the general &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and object of reproach. Be&s;ides, you may &s;uppo&s;e my father will pur&s;ue me, and, if under your roof, I mu&s;t be di&s;|cover'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your objections are ju&s;t, and yet you can be no where &s;o &s;afe, as under my protection. Sup|po&s;e then you were to be introduc'd to my aunt and &s;i&s;|ters, who have never &s;een you, under a feign'd name and character, as the daughter of a clergyman, a particular friend of mine; they have often heard me &s;peak of &s;uch a per&s;on, who has been &s;ome years dead, his name was Law&s;on.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Emi.</SPEAKER>
<P>I put my&s;elf under your lord&s;hips guidance, and &s;hall a&s;&s;ume whatever form you plea&s;e, 'till heaven thinks fit to let me wear my own with honour.</P>

<P>My dear &s;i&s;ter, let me di&s;&s;uade you from carrying on this affair with Mr. Freeman any farther; if he really loves you, and his family and fortune may pretend to &s;uch a match, why not con&s;ult my brother? who has an undoubted right to be con&s;idered as a fa|ther, from having acted on all occa&s;ions like one.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have very vulgar notions, &s;i&s;ter; I &s;uppo&s;e if you &s;hou'd ever have a lover, you will bid him a&s;k your parents whether you &s;hall like him or not?&mdash;poor &s;oul! but is it aunt Bridget, or uncle Frank, he &s;hall apply to? ha, ha! Do you know, my dear, that as well as I love my Strephon, if he were to &s;ay one &s;yllable about me to my grave brother, it is an hun|dred to one, I &s;hou'd dete&s;t him. Secrecy is the very e&s;&s;ence of love, and like all other e&s;&s;ences, it will eva|porate, the moment it gets air.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry to differ &s;o much in opinion with you, Loui&s;a, but I can't help thinking that the mo&s;t innocent corre&s;pondence, which can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub|&s;i&s;t between men and women, becomes in &s;ome de|gree criminal, when it is carried on clande&s;tinely; at lea&s;t, it mu&s;t appear as if one party was a&s;ham'd of the other, which you mu&s;t allow to be a &s;entiment, by no means con&s;i&s;tent with heroic love.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read, read, my dear, and improve your|&s;elf, for you are really very ignorant; did you ever hear of a heroine, in tragedy, or romance, who con|&s;ulted any third per&s;on, in the di&s;po&s;al of her heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't &s;ay I have read many of either; but to &s;uch over-weening confidence in our&s;elves, I believe we are indebted for many tragical &s;ubjects.</P>

<P>A truce! a truce! dear girl; and for this once, a&s;&s;i&s;t me. It is impo&s;&s;ible I can refu&s;e to &s;ee him this evening, when he &s;o ardently intreats it; in your grave mathematical calculation, he has been ab|&s;ent three weeks, but that, you know, is three thou|&s;and years, in a lover's calendar.</P>

<P>That's a bad phra&s;e, niece; revels imply revelling, which is a term indecent for &s;o young a lady to make u&s;e of.

But in &s;hort, Maria, I begin to think this wi&s;e brother of ours has his failings, like other men, and growing indolent, as they all do, chu&s;es to bring his favourites near home: did you ob&s;erve with what an enquiring eye he looked at you?

<P>For &s;hame, Loui&s;a, how can you think &s;o badly of a man who has de&s;erv'd &s;o well? Left to his care, even from our earlie&s;t years, what tender|ne&s;s, what delicacy has he not &s;hewn, both to our &s;ex and age?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Have now, my lord, frankly related to you all the circum&s;tances of this extra|ordinary novel, except the lady's name, which I hope, for her &s;ake, will ever remain a &s;ecret. What the deno&uuml;ement will be on her part, I cannot gue&s;s, but am determin'd it &s;hall not conclude in the u&s;ual &s;tile with me; for, from this hour, I di&s;claim all future thoughts of a &s;erious connection with any of the &s;ex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible, Sir Charles, that pa&s;&s;ion can &s;o far triumph over rea&s;on, as in one moment to de|&s;troy the good opinion of a character, form'd on a long acquaintance? You &s;ay you knew the lady from her childhood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Belmont, you have &s;tated this argument quite wrong, it was not pa&s;&s;ion that tri|umph'd over rea&s;on, but rea&s;on that &s;ubdued pa&s;&s;ion. I can now &s;ee, nay feel, what an abject wretch he mu&s;t be, who tru&s;ts his happine&s;s in a woman's pow|er&mdash;damn'd, &s;miling mi&s;chiefs, all!&mdash;I will, hence|forth, &s;ee, and admire the pretty baubles, as I wou'd a fine piece of china, but no more attribute worth and honour to them, than maleability to that; for if my Emily cou'd deceive, there is no truth in woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is mere common-place, Sir Charles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>By calling it common, my lord, you al|low it the general &s;en&s;e of mankind, which is, no doubt, founded on experience. I am therefore de|termined to profit by it, &s;o far as to retain my free|dom at lea&s;t. I think I almo&s;t feel the &s;hackles I might have worn, but for the old gentleman's refu&s;al.&mdash;Oh! how I thank him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="19">
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you mi&s;place your gratitude. I am not yet &s;ure that you are under any manner of ob|ligation to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly the greate&s;t, tho' his refu&s;al then was daggers to my heart.&mdash;Fool that I was, I thought her what &s;he &s;eem'd, an angel; and, but for him, Ixion like, I had embrac'd a cloud. But why do I &s;till talk, or think of her! &s;he is not worth a thought, and I hope to get quite clear of her idea, before I reach Harwich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, you deceive your&s;elf; her form will haunt you, fly where'er you will, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on that murderers fancy gho&s;ts&mdash;for I am per&s;uad|ed you have injur'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>What &s;hall I not believe my eyes! by heaven, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her guilt even conquer'd female fear; &s;he threw her&s;elf upon a madman's &s;word, &s;uch I then was; but 'twas to &s;ave her lover, and my rival; ungrateful woman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;eem inclin'd to lay hold of the dark &s;ide of every circum&s;tance; but there is one you &s;eem not yet to have attended to, or you cou'd not think of leaving England immediately. May not the gen|tleman, you encounter'd in your mi&s;tre&s;s's chamber, po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e you fled from him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That thought had quite e&s;cap'd me. I left a &s;ervant behind, whom I expect this night, in order to di&s;cover who my rival was; and al&s;o to find out what her father had done, or meant to do, with his unworthy, yet too lovely daughter: I fear he will u&s;e her cruelly, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you think of that, and talk of quitting England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, my lord, I have always look'd upon chivalry as a very ridiculous &s;cience, and yet I begin to think it has its foundation in na|ture, for I never yet heard of a dam&s;el in di&s;tre&s;s, that I did not wi&s;h to relieve her.</P>

<P>Sir Charles, this affair is much too &s;erious to je&s;t with. You have a&s;ked my opinion, and, as a man of honour, and your friend, I now declare, I think your travelling &s;cheme &s;hou'd be entirely laid a&s;ide, until this my&s;tery is properly explain'd.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir Charles, grant you no longer love, you are certainly a man of honour, and mu&s;t therefore think it incumbent on you to clear a lady's character, which may po&s;&s;ibly have &s;uffered as much on your account, in the minds of others, as &s;he has done in yours, from this unlucky accident.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd to heaven that I cou'd clear her to my own heart, from all &s;u&s;picion, with as much ju&s;tice, as I can to the world, of what relates to me; in her whole conduct and behaviour towards me, &s;he was purity her&s;elf, her &s;oul &s;eem'd even lovelier than her form, and ca&s;t a kind of glory round her beauty, which, while it awed, tran&s;ported, rai&s;ed, and cha&s;tis'd de&s;ire&mdash;yet &s;he is fal&s;e!</P>

<P>Permit me, my lord, to bring this argu|ment to a conclu&s;ion, by ob&s;erving, that young la|dies cannot expatiate on the the&s;is of love, without giving an intimation that they are adepts in the &s;cience; which would be rather an oppribrium, than an honour to per&s;ons not yet adult. But if your lord&s;hip plea&s;es, you and I will &s;upport the argument, in a Socratic manner; and treat the &s;ubject, as they would have done in the Athenian porch.</P>

<P>Do I know you, am I awake, or in my &s;en&s;es? If the&s;e things are true, I &s;urely &s;aw him i&s;&s;ue from your garden-door; his image is too &s;trongly fix'd upon my wounded memory, to think I can mi&s;|take; the moon &s;hone bright upon him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Lord Belmont, if I have in|jur'd you, by imagining you to be this unknown per|&s;on's friend, therefore no longer mine, what apology, what atonement can I make?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir Charles, you have wrong'd both truth and friend&s;hip; I never had a friend I dared to injure, or di&s;claim; yet, if it was not a vi&s;ion that you &s;aw, you are in &s;ome degree excu&s;e|able&mdash;yet, why &s;hou'd he come here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is indeed a my&s;tery&mdash;but as I cou'd not imagine he came to any one within the&s;e walls, except your lord&s;hip, I hope you'll pardon the frenzy of a man who thought him&s;elf aggriev'd in the mo&s;t tender points, his love and friend&s;hip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Charles, your &s;eeming motives for re|&s;entment were &s;o &s;trong, that I can readily forget the effects&mdash;I hope we are friends again&mdash;but let the

<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, my too generous friend! let me be happy &s;till in your e&s;teem, but bani&s;h from my mind all thoughts of love. Her guilt is fully proved; &s;he fled, that fatal night, from Bath, with her &s;educer. Cur&s;es bla&s;t him!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;cene of complicated di&s;tre&s;s, may &s;he not have fled for refuge to &s;ome friend? Why will you think the wor&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no, my lord, &s;he had no friend to fly to; for &s;ure he is the wor&s;t of foes, as well as vil|lains, that wou'd de&s;troy her innocence. I doubt not but the wretch may abandon her to want and infamy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think that &s;he is in his power. It is improbable that a well-educated maid &s;hou'd take &s;o ra&s;h a &s;tep, but on a certainty of marriage with the man &s;he lov'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hou'd rejoice to think as you do; and were there but the &s;lighte&s;t foundation for hope, wou'd gladly re&s;t upon it. But all my doubts are at an end; I am therefore determined to quit England. but not 'till I have found the man, who has robbed me of my peace, and Emily. I'll go this moment in pur&s;uit of him.</P>

And Mrs. Southerne, let me tell your lord|&s;hip, is a parlous wi&s;e woman, and never was mi&s;ta|ken in her whole life; at lea&s;t, I never thought her in the wrong, and therefore never contradicted her.</P>

<P>And &s;o &s;he has, my lord. I, like a careful father, as I was, and in regard to her poor mother's memory, provided a proper and convenient match for her; my neighbour Winterbottom, my lord, a man pretty near my own age, one that was fit to conduct and manage &s;uch a raw, head&s;trong chit, as &s;he; a di&s;creet per&s;on, let me tell you; and a great favourite of Mrs. Southerne's.</P>

<P>You cou'd not &s;urely think of marrying my cou&s;in to a per&s;on as old as her father, &s;ir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, why not, my lord, &s;he made no objection to his years, but truly &s;he di&s;lik'd his fa|mily and per&s;on, becau&s;e he was not a fine &s;mock-fac'd beau, and cou'd not trace his pedigree up to Adam, for&s;ooth; a conceited undutiful minx as &s;he was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot blame my cou&s;in's &s;pirit, &s;ir; her birth, youth, and fortune, entitle her to a very dif|ferent match; but were &s;he a beggar, &s;ir, &s;he had better &s;erve, to earn her bread, than wed the man &s;he hates.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever her conduct may have been, &s;ir, I fear yours towards her, has ju&s;tified it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I was too tender of her; when &s;he got into the pouts, and cry'd and roar'd, I promi&s;ed not to force her to this marriage; but if &s;he wou'd be a dutiful child, and con&s;ent to it, I wou'd take her with me to Bath; &s;he promis'd &s;he wou'd try to obey me, and, in an ill hour, to Bath I brought her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he married the fir&s;t man that a&s;k'd her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wor&s;e, much wor&s;e than that: &s;he &s;ent a fine &s;park, a baronet, I think he was, to a&s;k her for his wife, tho' &s;he knew very well, that Mrs. Southerne
<PB N="40" REF="44">
had pa&s;s'd her word &s;he &s;hou'd marry Winterbottom; and did &s;he think I wou'd make my lady a liar? No, no, I &s;ent him a packing, and order'd madam to prepare for Southerne-hall directly.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I not pre&s;ume to &s;ay, &s;ir, that this proceeding was too violent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>South.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray don't interrupt me, my lord, and you &s;hall hear how this gentle lady behaved.&mdash;About eleven that night, when I was &s;moking my pipe, I heard her &s;quall; I ran into her chamber, and there I found the knight, and another of her lovers, I &s;up|po&s;e, tilting at each other; I beat down their pa&s;&s;es with my crutch, the candle fell to the ground, and before the &s;ervants could bring light, madam and all were fled.</P>

<P>Have you heard nothing of her &s;ince?</P>
</SP>

<P>Not a &s;yllable, nor wou'd I ever have en|quired about her, but that my lady's honour is en|gaged to Winterbottom. Now, if you can a&s;&s;i&s;t me to di&s;cover where &s;he is, I'll bring a replevin for her, and carry her home directly. If Winterbottom will marry her, &s;o&mdash;if not, I'll keep her clo&s;e enough to prevent her bringing any farther di&s;grace on me, while I live, I warrant you.</P>

not by a replevin, that her character is to be reco|vered, though her per&s;on may. You, as her father, &s;ir, are fir&s;t bound to do her ju&s;tice; to call the man who has wrong'd her to a &s;trict account, and make him clear her fame by in&s;tant marriage.</P>

But not a penny will I give to buy her a fop, or a coxcomb, or a title; yet if either of tho&s;e fellows &s;he went off with, will marry her without money, why I'll e'en give my con|&s;ent, that I may he no longer plagu'd with her; tho' I am very much afraid that Mrs. Southerne will be angry.</P>

<P>I think he is him&s;elf a greater curio&s;ity, than any in his collection, my lord, but I fancy he has a mind to di&s;po&s;e of them all together, and means to give a bargain of them to Mi&s;s Law&s;on.</P>
</SP>

<P>He has done me the honour to offer me abun|dance of rarities, madam, but I am not di&s;po&s;ed to receive favours that I cannot return; therefore his trea&s;ures are all &s;afe for me</P>

<P>I rather think, my lord, that Mr. Belmont's flame is of that kind, which dying fires emit, to &s;hew their near extinction; and the faint blaze has, but by

accident, ca&s;t it's pale light on me; any other object might have been brighten'd by the &s;ame glimmer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wrong my uncle's ta&s;te; I have not heard of his propo&s;ing to marry any lady the&s;e five years. Before that time, he u&s;ed to be generally in love twice a year, and had his &s;ummer and winter pa&s;&s;ions, which he con&s;tantly chang'd with his cloaths for the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;urpriz'd, my lord, that among &s;uch a variety of mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, he never found one that wou'd marry him; his per&s;on mu&s;t have been tolerable, when he was young; his family and fortune unex|ceptionable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ur'd, &s;i&s;ter, that was not the ca&s;e; but by the time he had brought the lady to think favour|ably of him, he began to di&s;cover &s;ome imperfection in her. Perhaps her no&s;e was a hair's breadth longer or &s;horter than it &s;hou'd be, according to the exact rules of proportion; a foot, or a finger, perhaps, di&s;gu&s;ted him; on which, he immediately quitted his pur&s;uit, and went in &s;earch of another model.</P>
</SP>

<P>It is happy the men are not &s;o nice, now-a-days, or we &s;hou'd never be able to fix a lover.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy, Loui&s;a, that mu&s;t be at all times a difficult matter to accompli&s;h; a fine woman will, doubtle&s;s, captivate many, but there is &s;omething more than beauty, nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve her conque&s;t over one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, &s;o they &s;ay, my lord; but I pro|te&s;t I can't credit it. It is impo&s;&s;ible, I think, for a woman to lo&s;e her power, while &s;he retains her beauty.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>A moment's recollection mu&s;t furni&s;h you with &s;uch a number of in&s;tances to contradict your a&s;&s;ertion, Loui&s;a, that I'm afraid the argument will drop, on your conviction; and I &s;hou'd like va&s;tly to have it carried on.</P>

<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I grant, that while beauty la&s;ts, it will always have admirers. But the&s;e, Loui&s;a, are but pageants to a conqueror; the triumph mu&s;t be found at home, in the heartfelt love and e&s;teem of a man of &s;en&s;e and honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, my lord, but that &s;ame beauty, that cau&s;es admiration and attention in other men, will nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;erve our hu&s;band's love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means, Loui&s;a; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion damps the ardor of de&s;ire; merit alone can keep the flame alive, and hinder every wanton gale from blowing it abroad; that, like the ve&s;tal fire, mu&s;t be pre&s;erv'd by con&s;tant watching.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your account, my lord, a married woman has ju&s;t as bad a life as a ve&s;tal, if her whole time is to be &s;pent in keeping one &s;park alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>L. Bel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will allow her ta&s;k is full as arduous, tho' more plea&s;ing. Men are naturally incon&s;tant; and a hu&s;band may &s;ometimes &s;ee a woman fairer than his wife; but 'tis her fault, if in the whole circle, he can find one that &s;o well de&s;erves his love; who&s;e temper, manners, conduct, and behaviour, are &s;o much &s;uited to his &s;entiments; who knows no wi&s;h or will, but to plea&s;e him&mdash;the&s;e charms, the homelie&s;t woman may acquire; without them, the faire&s;t form that ever &s;truck our eyes, cannot retain one heart.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>L. Mar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my lord, we are va&s;tly obliged to you for this excellent le&s;&s;on; and ought to think our|&s;elves extremely happy in &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible and kind in|&s;tructor.</P>
