</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes it is to me; I never will bear to &s;ee a &s;oldier cheated, with my eyes open. I love a &s;ol|dier, and will always &s;tand by them.</P>

O my con&s;cience, if I had the management of affairs, I would &s;everely puni&s;h all &s;uch fellows who would be &s;o ba&s;e as to cheat a poor &s;oldier.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="9">
You mu&s;t know, I got &s;o much credit at the Fete Champetre there, that little Ro&s;cius recommended me to the Managers of Drury Lane, and &s;o now I am a &s;ort of deputy &s;uperintendant under Mr. Lanturnburg, the great painter; that as &s;oon as he executes a thing, I always de&s;ign it after him, my jewel; &s;o I'm going to take a &s;ide front view of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;arvant Mr. Blaud, though faith to do him ju&s;tice, he has forgot the fa&s;hion of his country, for when he is determined to be a rogue he is hone&s;t enough to own it. But pray what connection have you with the &s;uttlers? You are no victualler here are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not ab&s;olutely a victualler, but I deal in various articles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but no bu&s;ine&s;s is done here only by contract.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>A contractor! Why what the devil you are not ri&s;en to &s;uch preferment as that &s;ure? I never knew you was able to furni&s;h any con|tract.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gage.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing more ea&s;y; the circum&s;tance depends upon the quantity, not the quality. I got on very well lately, but at fir&s;t it brought me in &s;everal confounded &s;crapes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O Daub.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Flower! no, no&mdash;I &s;hould have &s;aved nothing by that: I went to the fountain head&mdash;the pit, and gave 'em a plentiful &s;tock of lime.</P>

<P>Why at fir&s;t it an&s;wered the purpo&s;e very well, while the weather was fine it did charmingly, but one field-day they was all caught in a fine &s;oaking &s;hower; the &s;moke ran along the lines, ecod their heads were all &s;lack'd in an in&s;tant, and by the time they returned to the camp, damme if

all their heads were not as &s;mooth as an old half crown.</P>
</SP>

<P>A very cro&s;s accident indeed.</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes, I &s;tood a near chanceof being tied up to the halberts; but I excu&s;ed my&s;elf by &s;aying, they looked only like raw recruits before; but now they appeared like old veterans of &s;ervice.</P>
