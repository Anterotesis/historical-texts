<HEAD>AN ANSWER To Some OBJECTIONS OF A <HI>Moderate ENQUIRER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Robert Snow,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE received a Paper &s;ub&s;cribed by thee, and directed to the Church or People of God called <HI>Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. Which Paper contains &s;ome <HI>Objections,</HI> which (thou &s;ay&s;t) thou ha&s;t heard &s;poken again&s;t us, and wherein thou de&s;ire&s;t to be &s;a|tisfied. To which we &s;ay, It is no &s;trange Thing to us to be &s;poken again&s;t by the World's Teachers, that being no more than befel the People of God, in the Fir&s;t breaking forth of Chri&s;tianity in the World, Of whom it was &s;aid, <HI>Acts</HI> 28. 22. <HI>As concerning this Sect, we know that every where it is &s;poken again&s;t.</HI> But we are willing to endeavour thy Satisfaction, by An&s;wering the <HI>Objections.</HI></P>
<P>The Fir&s;t is, <HI>You own no Day, either the Fir&s;t or La&s;t, as a Sabbath to the Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer:</HI> The Sabbath (which was the &s;eventh or la&s;t Day of the Week) was given to the <HI>Jews, Ex.</HI> 16. 29. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 4. Not to the <HI>Gentiles, P&s;al.</HI> 147. 19, 20. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. 19. and was to la&s;t (as other typical Or|dinances
<PB N="2" REF="3">
were) <HI>untill the time of Reformation, Heb.</HI> 9. 10. <HI>till the Seed &s;hould come, Gal.</HI> 3. 19. <HI>which was Chri&s;t. ver.</HI> 16. <HI>the Lord of the Sabbath, Mat.</HI> 12. 8. <HI>who, in the Fulne&s;s of time, did blot out the Hand-writing of Ordi|nances,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and took it out the Way, nailing it to his Cro&s;s, Col.</HI> 2. 14. From whence the Apo&s;tle thus in|fers, <HI>Let no man therefore judge you</HI> (the Saints and faithful Brethren, <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 2.) <HI>in Meat or in Drink, or in re&s;pect of an Holy Day, or of the New Moon or of the Sabbath Days, Col.</HI> 2. 16. which, &s;ays he, <HI>are a Shadow of things to come, but the Body is of Chri&s;t. ver.</HI> 17. Thus was that <HI>Sabbath,</HI> which was given by God, to his People the <HI>Jews,</HI> ended and taken away by Chri&s;t, before the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were called to be his People. And as for the <HI>Fir&s;t Day</HI> of the Week, we do not read in the Holy Scriptures, that it is called the <HI>Sabbath-Day,</HI> or commanded to be kept and ob&s;erved for a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> as the <HI>Seventh Day</HI> had been. But, on the contrary, we find the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> writing to the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were <HI>Gentiles</HI> (though not without &s;ome mixture of believing <HI>Jews</HI> among&s;t them, as appears, <HI>Acts</HI> 18. 2.) &s;ays, <HI>One Man e&s;teems one Day above an|other</HI> (there was the believing <HI>Jew</HI>) <HI>Another e&s;teem|eth every Day alike</HI> (there was the believing <HI>Gentile.</HI>) Well, what then! Doth he commend the Former of the&s;e, and condemn the Latter? No but he &s;ays, <HI>Let every Man be fully per&s;waded in his own Mind,</HI> Rom. 14. 5. And in the 4<HI>th.</HI> 10<HI>th.</HI> and 13<HI>th.</HI> ver&s;es di&s;&s;wades them from judging one another about the Ob&s;erving, or not ob&s;erving a Day, as well as about the Eating, or not eating of Meats; and &s;eems to lay no more Stre&s;s upon the one, than the other. And if the Drift of the Apo&s;tle's di&s;cour&s;e there be heedfully minded, it will appear that, as he &s;ets him who believed he might eat all Things, with him that e&s;teemed every Day a like; and him that e&s;teemed one Day above another, with him that eat Herbs: So he imputes the Weakne&s;s to the Latter, <HI>ver.</HI> 2. and &s;ets him&s;elf on
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the other &s;ide, &s;aying, <HI>We then that are &s;trong ought to bear the Infirmities of the Weak,</HI> Chap. 15. 1. And he tells the <HI>Galatians</HI> (which though a <HI>Gentile Chureh,</HI> had al&s;o <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Believers in it) <HI>I am afraid of you, le&s;t I have be&s;towed upon you Labour in vain,</HI> Gal. 4. 11. Why &s;o? <HI>Ye ob&s;erve Days and Months, and Times, and Years,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. So jealous was the Apo&s;tle, le&s;t any that had been gathered from outward Ob&s;er|vations, and from a &s;hadowy State, &s;hould imbon|dage them&s;elves again in Shadows, and fall &s;hort of injoying the Sub&s;tance, which is the true Go&s;pel <HI>Re&s;t that remains to the People of God,</HI> Heb. 4. 9. Which in the next ver&s;e is de&s;cribed to be, Their <HI>Cea&s;ing</HI> from their <HI>own Works, as God did from his. Into which Re&s;t we</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>that have helieved, do en|ter, ver.</HI> 3. and in the 11. ver&s;e he pre&s;&s;es others to labour to enter into that Re&s;t. Now when the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, There Remains a Re&s;t, it plainly implies that the former Re&s;t, the outward Sabbatical Re&s;t, did not remain, but was pa&s;&s;ed away and gone. Nor is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Re&s;t here men|tioned, which is &s;aid to Remain to the People of God, was an outward Bodily Re&s;ting from outward Bodily Labour, on what &s;oever Day; both, as that would be but to change one Type or Figure for an|other, and, as the entring into this Re&s;t is &s;et forth in the Text, as a Matter of Labour and Difficulty, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. as it is indeed, yet ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, he hath enabled &s;ome, that have believed in his Name, and &s;ubjected to his Power, to enter into this Re&s;t, in this his Day; and many are pre&s;&s;ing after it, as the true, abiding Go&s;pel-Re&s;t, which the Legal Sab|bath was but a Type or Shadow of.</P>
<P>The 2. OBJECTION is, <HI>You deny the Scriptures to be any Rule for Man or Woman to walk by, &s;o as to di|rect them to the &s;aving of their Souls.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> In this we are mi&s;repre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ented. We &s;in|cerely own, love and regard the Holy Scriptures, be|lieving
<PB N="4" REF="5">
with the Apo&s;tle, that <HI>they were given by In|&s;piration of God, and are profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furni&s;hed unto all good Works,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16, 17. and that <HI>they are able to make wi&s;e unto Salvation, through Faith that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, ver.</HI> 15. And great be|nefit and delight we &s;ind in them, reading them in the openings of that Divine Spirit, by which they were given forth. We are &s;o far from denying them to be <HI REND="blackletterType">any</HI> Rule, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that we acknowledge them to contain <HI REND="blackletterType">many</HI> excellent Rules, Precepts, Doctrines and In&s;tructions, directing Man and Woman how to walk, that they may obtain the Salvation of their Souls. Yet we do not &s;ay (as &s;ome have done) that the Scriptures are the <HI>only</HI> Rule, or the <HI>chief</HI> and <HI>principal</HI> Rule: becau&s;e we dare not give the Hon|our and Office of the Holy Spirit unto the Scriptures; For the Scriptures them&s;elves declare, That <HI>it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to guide Believers into all Truth, John.</HI> 16. 13. And indeed, the true Meaning and Benefit of the Scriptures them&s;elves is not at|tained to in the Reading of them, unle&s;s the Spirit that gave them forth do open them, and un&s;eal the My&s;teries contained in them. So that the Holy Spi|rit is greater than the Scriptures, and therefore we cannot but give the chief Place unto him. For he is able to manife&s;t him&s;elf unto Man, and to lead man into the Way of Salvation, either with and by the Scriptures, or without them, as he plea&s;es: But the Scriptures cannot do that without the Operation of the Holy Spirit. Ju&s;tly therefore do we affirm the Spirit of God, to be the <HI>Chief</HI> Rule, and yet acknow|ledge the Holy Scriptures to be a true Rule, and pro|per In&s;trument in the Hand of the Spirit, to direct Men and Women how they ought to walk, to obtain Salvation to their Souls, as the Spirit of the Lord makes u&s;e of the Scriptures to that End.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">The 3d OBJECTION is, <HI>You deny the Re&s;urrection of this mortal Body, that this Mortal &s;hall not put on Immortality.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> In this al&s;o we are mi&s;repre&s;ented: We do not deny, but own the Re&s;urrection of the Dead; Believing, with the Apo&s;tle, that <HI>This Corruptible &s;hall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal &s;hall put on Immortality,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 54. And indeed, if we did not believe this, we might well &s;ay (as he did) <HI>If in this Life only we have Hope in Chri&s;t, we were of all Men mo&s;t mi&s;erable,</HI> ver. 19. <HI>And, Why &s;tand we in jeopar|dy every Hour,</HI> ver. 30. But the Lord knows, and we have openly and &s;incerely declared, that we believe and own the Re&s;urrection of the Dead, according as the Holy Scriptures te&s;tify concerning it; Which &s;ay, <HI>Thou &s;owe&s;t not that Body that &s;hall be, but bare Grain</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But God giveth it a Body as it hath plea&s;ed him, and to every Seed his own Body,</HI> ver. 37, 38. <HI>It is &s;own a natural Body; it is rai&s;ed a Spiritual Body,</HI> ver. 44. the rea&s;on of which follows <HI>ver.</HI> 50. namely, <HI>That Fle&s;h and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.</HI> And as we firmly believe this; So we take this to be &s;ufficient, without being &s;o curiou&s;ly inqui&s;itive as he, who would needs ask, <HI>How are the Dead rai&s;ed up? and with what Body do they come?</HI> ver. 35. and was called <HI>Fool</HI> for his Pains, <HI>ver.</HI> 36.</P>
<P>The 4th OBJECTION is, <HI>You &s;uffer Women to be your Teachers, that were forbid by the Apo&s;tle, for he &s;ays, that they &s;hould keep &s;ilence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer,</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> of old had a &s;trong Per&s;ua&s;ion (grounded upon &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tood Places of Scrip|ture) that the Salvation of God was confined to them, and belonged not at all to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And this Opinion had prevailed &s;o far upon them, that even tho&s;e of them that received the Go&s;pel could not ea&s;ily &s;hake it off. In &s;o much that, after <HI>Peter</HI> had been with <HI>Cornelius</HI> the <HI>Centurion,</HI> and was come
<PB N="6" REF="7">
back again to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> he was called before the Church for it, <HI>they that were of the Circumci&s;ion con|tending with him,</HI> and <HI>&s;aying, Thou went'&s;t in to Men uncircumci&s;ed, and did'&s;t eat with them,</HI> Act. 11. 2, 3. To whom, having related the Occa&s;ion and Particulars of that Matter, he concludes his Defence thus, <HI>For as much then as God gave them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, what was I, that I could with&s;tand God?</HI> ver. 17. And in the next ver&s;e it follows, <HI>when they heard the&s;e Things they held their Peace, and glo|ri&s;ied God,</HI> &amp;c. This An&s;wer, which the Apo&s;tle gave in that Ca&s;e, may be &s;uitable (we think) for us to give in this Ca&s;e, to &s;uch as (from &s;ome mi&s;under|&s;tood Places of Scripture) are offended at us for Suf|fering Women to &s;peak in our A&s;&s;emblies, <HI>viz.</HI> For as much as God hath given them the like Gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, what are we that we &s;hould with&s;tand God? God, by his Servant <HI>Joel,</HI> in the Time of the Law, had made this Promi&s;e, with Relation to the Times of the Go&s;pel, <HI>viz. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s afterwards (or in the la&s;t Days, as</HI> Peter <HI>repeats it,</HI> Act. 2. 17.) <HI>that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fle&s;h, and your Sons and your Daughters &s;hall prophecy, your old Men &s;hall dream Dreams, your young Men &s;hall &s;ee Vi&s;ions: And al&s;o upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in the&s;e Days will I pour out my Spirit,</HI> Joel 2. 28, 29. (And they &s;hall prophecy, adds <HI>Peter,</HI> Act. 2. 18.) Here was no Di&s;tinction of Sex made; But this Promi&s;e of <HI>pouring out the Spirit,</HI> and of <HI>prophe&s;ying</HI> thereby, is extended as expre&s;ly and fully to the Daughters as to the Sons, to the Handmaids as to the Servants. And this the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> doth expre&s;ly apply to that great <HI>pouring forth of the Spirit upon the Church,</HI> at the Penteco&s;t immediately after Chri&s;t's A&s;cen|&s;ion, &s;aying, <HI>This is that which was &s;poken by the Pro|phet Joel,</HI> Acts 2. 16. Now at that great and emi|nent
<PB N="7" REF="8">
pouring forth of the Spirit it appears the Wo|men were not excluded: For when, after the A&s;cen|tion, the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples were returned from Mount <HI>Olivet</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> it is &s;aid, <HI>The&s;e all con|tinued with one Accord in Prayer and Supplication with the Women, and Mary the Mother of Je&s;us,</HI> &amp;c. Acts 1. 14. The Number of the Names together being a|bout an hundred and twenty, ver. 15. <HI>And when the Day of Penteco&s;t was fully come, they were <HI REND="blackletterType">all</HI> with one Accord in one Place,</HI> Chap. 2. 1. and in ver&s;. 3. it is &s;aid, the cloven <HI>Tongues &s;ate upon <HI REND="blackletterType">each</HI> of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, and began to &s;peak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance,</HI> ver. 4. Here was no Di&s;tinction made; no &s;hutting out the Women; but all were together, all received the Gift of the Spirit, and began to <HI>Speake with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them ut|terance.</HI> Nor was it thus only at that time, and up|on that extraordinary Occa&s;ion, but continued in the Church afterwards. For we read <HI>that Philip the Evangeli&s;t had four Daughters that did Prophe&s;y;</HI> Acts 21. 8, 9. <HI>Phebe,</HI> a Woman, is recommended by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> to the Church at <HI>Rome,</HI> not only as a <HI>Si&s;ter,</HI> but as a <HI>Servant of the Church,</HI> Rom. 16. 1. <HI>Pri&s;cilla,</HI> a Woman, is called by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, <HI>My Helper</HI> (or Fellow Labourer) <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> ver. 3. <HI>Tryphena</HI> and <HI>Trypho&s;a,</HI> two godly Women, are &s;aluted by him as <HI>Labourers in the Lord;</HI> And of the beloved <HI>Per&s;is,</HI> another Holy Woman, he te&s;ti|fies, that <HI>&s;he laboured much in the Lord,</HI> ver. 12. The &s;ame Apo&s;tle, in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>I intreat thee al&s;o, true Yoke Fellow, help tho&s;e Women which laboured with me in the Go&s;pel,</HI> Phil. 4. 3. Which is the Phra&s;e by which the Apo&s;tle doth frequently expre&s;s his own Mini&s;try, And which he particu|larly applies to <HI>Timotheus,</HI> whom he calls <HI>Our Bro|ther and Mini&s;ter of God, and our Fellow Labourer in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 The&s;. 3. 2. Which is a clear Evi|dence
<PB N="8" REF="9">
that tho&s;e Women, that had received the Gift of Prophe&s;y, did mini&s;ter therein to the Edification of the Church, as well as the Men. Nay the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in that very Epi&s;tle, wherein he is thought by &s;ome to di&s;countenance <HI>Womens Preaching,</HI> doth give Directions for the Manner of their <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Pro|phe&s;ying,</HI> viz. <HI>That they &s;hould do it with their Heads covered.</HI> For having fir&s;t &s;aid, <HI>Every Man praying or prophe&s;ying, having his Head covered, di&s;honoureth his Head,</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 4. He adds, <HI>But every Woman that Prayeth or Prophe&s;yeth with her Head uncovered di&s;|honoured her Head,</HI> ver. 5. This puts it out of doubt, that Womens <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> in the Church, was at that Time both lawful and u&s;ual, as well as Mens.</P>
<P>Now, that by <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> here is meant <HI>Preaching</HI> (not barely foretelling Things to come) may not only be inferred from the u&s;e of the &s;ame Word in the ver&s;e foregoing, where, being &s;poken of Men, it is granted on all Hands to intend <HI>Preaching</HI> (and from thence the general practice of <HI>Mens Preaching uncovered</HI> is defended) but may al&s;o fairly be con|cluded, from the explanation the Apo&s;tle gives of it, in Chap. 14. ver. 31. where he tells that Church in general, <HI>We may all Prophe&s;y one by one that</HI> all <HI>may</HI> learn; Which manife&s;ts that by <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> he in|tended <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> that being the proper way or means of <HI>Learning.</HI> And in the Beginning of that Chapter, where he prefers <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> before <HI>Speaking whith Tongues,</HI> ver. 1. and 5. he &s;ays, <HI>He that Prophe&s;yeth, Speaketh unto Men, to Edification, and Exhortation, and Comfort,</HI> ver. 3. And, <HI>He that Pro|phe&s;yeth, Edifieth the Church,</HI> ver. 4. which plainly &s;hew that by <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> he meant <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> that being the proper means or way of E|difying. And therefore, &s;eeing he not only allowed Women to <HI>Prophecy,</HI> but directed and advi&s;ed them how they &s;hould perform it <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. 5. and that in
<PB N="9" REF="10">
this Place <HI>Prophe&s;ying</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> appear to be one and the &s;ame Thing, it is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e he denied them the Liberty of <HI>Preaching,</HI> being gifted and called thereunto. As for tho&s;e Words of his, 1 Cor. 14. 34. <HI>Let your Women keep &s;ilence in the Churches: &s;or it is not permitted unto them to &s;peak; but to be under Obedience, as al&s;o &s;aith the Law.</HI> Ob|&s;erve fir&s;t, that tho&s;e Words, [<HI>as al&s;o &s;aith the Law</HI>] relate only to the Womens being under <HI>Obedience,</HI> not to their keeping <HI>&s;ilence</HI> in the Church: For that was never enjoyned them in the Law, but they were permitted to &s;peak in the Congregation; And both <HI>Miriam,</HI> who was a Prophete&s;s, did &s;ing the Tri|umphs of the Lord, in the publick Congregation, <HI>Ex.</HI> 15. 20. 21. And <HI>Deborah,</HI> who was a Prophete&s;s, did recount the noble Acts of the Lord, and cele|brate his Prai&s;es in a Triumphant Song, <HI>Judges</HI> 5. Read al&s;o what <HI>Hanna</HI> &s;pake in the Hou&s;e of the Lord in <HI>Shiloh,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2. And <HI>Anna,</HI> who was a Pro|phete&s;s, did not only give thanks unto the Lord, but &s;pake of Chri&s;t to all them that looked for Redem|ption in <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Luke</HI> 2. 38. This was direct <HI>Preaching,</HI> and that <HI>in the Temple.</HI> So that the Wo|men were not enjoyned <HI>&s;ilence</HI> under the Law, but were permitted to <HI>Speak.</HI> In the next Place, con|&s;ider what Speaking it was that was forbidden by the Apo&s;tle in that Place, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. 34. which from his following Words will appear to be, not a Speak|ing of the Words of Life and Salvation, not a Speak|ing as the Spirit of God gives utterance; but &s;peak|ing di&s;orderly, asking Que&s;tions un&s;ea&s;onably, and out of place; not &s;peaking for the Edification of Others, but &s;peaking for their own Information on|ly: for he immediately adds, <HI>If they will learn any Thing, let them ask their Husbands at home,</HI> ver. 35. The&s;e Words [<HI REND="blackletterType">learn</HI> and <HI REND="blackletterType">ask</HI>] plainly &s;hew, that the Speaking here condemned was not a Speaking the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of the Go&s;pel for the Edification of the
<PB N="10" REF="11">
Church; but <HI>asking Que&s;tions</HI> for their own Sati&s;|faction, which they might have done at home, but not there: therefore he adds, <HI>For it is a Shame for Women to &s;peak in the Church.</HI> And &s;o indeed it was, in &s;uch a di&s;orderly manner as they &s;peake, to inter|rogate or Catechi&s;e either the Mini&s;ter, or their Hu&s;bands, openly in the Church; to ask the Meaning of this, or call for an Explanation of that, which might look like a throwing off their Obedience to their Hu&s;band, and mu&s;t needs Occa&s;ion Di&s;orders and Confu&s;ion in the A&s;&s;embly; which we may per|ceive was the Thing that troubled the Apo&s;tle, and which he laboured to reform: for he &s;aid before, <HI>God is not the Author of Confu&s;ion, but of Peace,</HI> ver. 33. and he concludes the Chapter with this Admonition, <HI>Let all Things be done decently and in Order:</HI> So that it was the di&s;orderly Practice of &s;ome Women in that Church which he reproves, who, it &s;eems, when any Thing was &s;poken which they did not under&s;tand, would interpo&s;e, and <HI>ask Que&s;tions</HI> for information Sake, which was uncomely in them, offen&s;ive and trouble&s;ome to the Congregation. This &s;ort of <HI>Speak|ing</HI> was not permitted them, but was a Shame to them, and from which they ought to have kept &s;ilence <HI>in the Church.</HI> And <HI>if they will learn any Thing,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>let them ask their Husbands at home.</HI> Of like import are tho&s;e other Words, of the &s;ame Apo&s;tle to <HI>Timo|thy,</HI> and probably on the &s;ame Occa&s;ion. <HI>Let the Wo|man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>learn in &s;ilence with all Subjection. But I &s;uffer not a Woman to teach, nor to u&s;urp Authority over the Man, but to be in &s;ilence,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 11, 12. For hence it appears &s;till, that the Occa&s;ion they took of &s;peaking, was under pretence of <HI REND="blackletterType">learning,</HI> wherein they took an undue Liberty to <HI>ask Que&s;tions,</HI> as if they would catechi&s;e or teach their Hu&s;bands. But though the Apo&s;tle would not &s;uffer &s;uch &s;ort of Speaking in the Church, as might give Occa&s;ion to any to think that the Women did ca&s;t off the Obe|dience
<PB N="11" REF="12">
they owed, and did u&s;urp Authority over their Hu&s;bands; nor after &s;uch a manner, as might breed Confu&s;ion in the Congregation (for he was &s;o watchful again&s;t that, that he enjoyns the Man to be &s;ilent in that Ca&s;e, as well as the Woman. <HI>If any Man,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;peak in an unknown Tongue,&mdash;let one interpret. But if there be no Interpreter, let him keep &s;ilence in the Church;</HI> 1 Cor. 14. 27, 28. Yet we have before &s;hewed, that he allowed of <HI>Women prophe&s;y|ing,</HI> and that by <HI>Prophe&s;ying,</HI> he meant <HI>Preaching.</HI> We have al&s;o given many In&s;tances of Women that laboured in the Work of the Go&s;pel in that Day; and could, from a living and &s;ure experience, multi|ply In&s;tances of many Women in this Day, whom the Lord hath committed the Word of Life and Re|conciliation unto, and who, in the quickning Power and Vertue thereof, have &s;ounded forth the &s;ame, to the awakening of many that were a &s;leep in Sin, and turning of many <HI>from Darkne&s;s to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God,</HI> who are now become living Seals of their Mini&s;try. Neither would this &s;eem &s;o &s;trange as it doth to &s;ome, did they duly con&s;ider, That <HI>God is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons.</HI> But that, as, in the <HI>old Creation,</HI> Male and Female were Created in the Image of God: So, in the <HI>new Creation,</HI> Male and Female are all one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 28. But, as they that contended with <HI>Peter,</HI> for conver&s;ing with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> when they had heard his Defence, held their Peace, and glorified God, &s;aying, <HI>Then hath God al&s;o to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto Life, Acts</HI> 11. 18. So, we hope they that have taken Offence at us, for &s;uffering Women to <HI>&s;peak</HI> in the Church, when they &s;hall have duly and impartially weighed, what is herein offered for their Satisfaction, will hold their Peace (as to any Oppo&s;ition thereunto) and glorify God, &s;aying, <HI>Then hath God committed unto Women al&s;o the Word of Reconciliation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">The fifth Objection is, <HI>You are a People that have gained Health to your Immortal Souls, and are &s;ure of Heaven, when the Scriptures &s;ay, that</HI> the Righteous Man falls &s;even times a Day; <HI>and the Apo&s;tle</HI> Paul <HI>&s;aid that</HI> Sin was &s;till actually in him.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> We do not de&s;ire to boa&s;t of any Attain|ments. Yet we cannot but confe&s;s, to the Glory of God, and the Prai&s;e of his Holy Name, that His &s;aving Health hath appeared in this his Day, and we (through his Mercy) have ta&s;ted of it. Chri&s;t, the Saviour, is manife&s;ted in Spirit, and we (through Grace) have felt the healing Virtue of his Divine Life and Power. Through the tender Mercy of our God, the Day-&s;pring from on high hath vi&s;ited us, and hath given Light to us that &s;ate in Darkne&s;s and in the Shadow of Death, and hath guided our Feet into the way of Peace, and hath helped us to make our Calling and Election &s;ure. As for the Scripture thou mentione&s;t, we do not find that the Scripture &s;aith, <HI>The Righteous Man falls &s;even times a Day;</HI> but in <HI>Prov.</HI> 24. 16. we find it thus written, <HI>For a Ju&s;t Man falleth &s;even times, and ri&s;eth up a|gain; but the Wicked &s;hall fall into Mi&s;chief.</HI> And as the Ver&s;e before &s;hews the Occa&s;ion of the&s;e Words, where it is &s;aid, <HI>Lay not wait, O wicked Man, again&s;t the Dwelling of the Righteous: &s;poil not his re&s;ting place.</HI> So the latter Part of this 16th Ver&s;e [<HI>but the wicked &s;hall fall into Mi&s;chief</HI>] implies, that the ju&s;t Man doth not fall, as the wicked Man does, <HI>into Mi&s;chief.</HI> And &s;eeing all Sin is Mi&s;chief, it &s;eems as if the Fall here &s;poken of the ju&s;t Man, were not a <HI>falling into Sin,</HI> but into &s;ome outward Calamity or Exerci&s;e.

of the Soul; in &s;ome of which he cried out, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who &s;hall deliver,</HI> &amp;c!

<P>The 6th Objection is, <HI>Why your Teachers per&s;wade you, that all other People are in a barren and de&s;olate Condition, and are out of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Our Teachers do not per&s;wade us &s;o; nor do we Judge &s;o of all other People: For we our &s;elves were gathered out of various Profe&s;&s;ions, States and Conditions; and &s;ome of us, who had been &s;eeking after the Lord in other Profe&s;&s;ions, can remember, that before we were thus gathered to this divine Principle of <HI>Light,</HI> which the Lord hath &s;et up, in this his Day, as an En&s;ign for the Na|tions to be gathered unto, and to walk in: we were not wholly barren and de&s;olate; but had, at Sea&s;ons, &s;ome touches and ta&s;ts of the Vertue of that hidden Life, which we were then Strangers to; the Lord having regard to the Sincerity of our Hearts, and an&s;wering, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the Breathings of our Souls to him; &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as to cheri&s;h and keep alive tho&s;e good De&s;ires which were begotten in us, and to beget in us a greater Hunger and Thir&s;t after him. And it is not hard to us to believe, that
<PB N="14" REF="15">
&s;o it may be with others at this Day, who have an Integrity to the Lord, though not acquainted with his Outgoings, and Manife&s;tations of him&s;elf in this Di&s;pen&s;ation of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Life:</HI> And both our Prayers to God the Father, in and through his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and our Labour and Endeavours, in the Openings of his Love and Life in our Hearts, are, that all the&s;e, in what&s;oever Profe&s;&s;ion, may be drawn off from all the dry Hills and barren Mountains, and gathered into the true Sheepfold. For we remember our Saviour &s;aid, <HI>Other Sheep I have, which are not of this Fold: them al&s;o I mu&s;t bring, and they &s;hall hear my Voice; and there &s;hall be one Fold, and one Shepherd,</HI> Joh. 10. 16. The Lord grant, that none of the&s;e may mi&s;take his Voice, or di&s;obey it.</P>
<P>The la&s;t Objection is, <HI>You deny all outward Ordi|nances, as</HI> Bapti&s;m, <HI>and the</HI> Six Principles, <HI>that were taught to the fir&s;t primitive Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law was <HI>out|ward,</HI> and the Ordinances appertaining to that Di&s;|pen&s;ation were <HI>outward</HI> al&s;o: But the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel is &s;piritual and <HI>inward,</HI> and the Or|dinances appertaining to this Di&s;pen&s;ation are of a &s;piritual Nature. The <HI>Bapti&s;m with Water</HI> was <HI>John</HI>'s, and came up under the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Law, nor did properly belong to the Go&s;pel Di&s;|pen&s;ation, though for a time, by Conde&s;cention, continued, as Circumci&s;ion, and &s;ome other Legal Rites, were. And this was that Bapti&s;m which <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t &s;ent him not to baptize with, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 17. But the <HI>Bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t,</HI> the true Go&s;pel-Bapti&s;m, that by which the true Believer is bap|ti&s;ed into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. 3. and buried with him into Death, ver. 4. <HI>The one Bapti&s;m,</HI> Eph. 4. 5. <HI>is the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t and with Fire,</HI> and is plainly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Bapti&s;m with Wa|ter, both by <HI>John,</HI> to whom the Water-Bapti&s;m
<PB N="15" REF="16">
belonged, and by Chri&s;t, to whom the Spirit-Bap|ti&s;m belonged. For <HI>John</HI> &s;aid, <HI>I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, who&s;e Shoos I am not worthy to bear: He &s;hall Baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t and with Fire,</HI> Mat. 3. 11. And Chri&s;t, as <HI>Luke</HI> records a little before his A&s;cention, &s;aid, <HI>John truly bap|tized with Water, but ye &s;hall be baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t not many days hence,</HI> Acts 1. 5. which was the Promi&s;e of the Father, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. delivered by Chri&s;t to his Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples, ju&s;t before his parting from them, <HI>Luke</HI> 24. 49. Let it therefore be fairly con&s;idered, 1. That the Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel is <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and therefore the Ordinances belonging to it &s;hould be &s;o too. 2 That in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 19. (From which place the Commi&s;&s;ion for Water-Bapti&s;m is u&s;ually fetched) there is no mention of Water. 3. That Bapti&s;m with Water is no where in Scripture called Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m. 4. That Bap|ti&s;m with Water is frequently called <HI>John's Bapti&s;m.</HI> 5. That the Bapti&s;m with the Holy Gho&s;t is called <HI>Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m.</HI> 6. That the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> acknow|ledges but <HI>One Bapti&s;m,</HI> Eph. 4. 5. which cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be that with <HI>Water,</HI> &s;ince then he mu&s;t exclude the Bapti&s;m of the <HI>Spirit.</HI> 7. That the A|po&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;peaking of the Bapti&s;m that &s;aves, &s;ays expre&s;ly, <HI>It is not the putting away the Filth of the Fle&s;h,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 21. (which it is the Property of Water to do) as if he had &s;aid, <HI>The Bapti&s;m which now &s;aves us is not Water-Bapti&s;m.</HI> 8. That Bap|ti&s;m with Water is no where expre&s;ly commanded in Scripture, as it would doubtle&s;s have been, had it been intended by Chri&s;t for a Go&s;pel Ordinance. 9. That tho' it was &s;ometimes u&s;ed after Chri&s;t's A&s;cention, yet that cannot authorize the u&s;e of it now, any more than of Circumci&s;ion, and other Legal Ordinances, which, in Conde&s;cention to the Weakne&s;s of Believers in that Day, were al&s;o u&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="17">
after Chri&s;t's A&s;cention, yet are confe&s;t by all not to be in force now. For <HI>John,</HI> as him&s;elf &s;aid, was to <HI>decrea&s;e,</HI> Joh. 3. 30. which related to his Mini&s;try or Di&s;pen&s;ation, not to his Per&s;on. Now a <HI REND="blackletterType">De|crea&s;ing</HI> implies a growing le&s;s, or wearing away by degrees, not all on a &s;uddain; or at once; and therefore no wonder, if his Water-Bapti&s;m was continued for a time, even after Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m of the Holy Spirit took place. But as Chri&s;t's Bapti&s;m was to <HI>increa&s;e,</HI> &s;o <HI>John</HI>'s was to <HI>decrea&s;e,</HI> till Chri&s;t's came to be <HI>all in all,</HI> and <HI>John</HI>'s Water Bap|ti&s;m wholly to give place. Let the&s;e things, we &s;ay, be duly weighed, and we hope we &s;hall not be blamed, for leaving the Bapti&s;m of <HI>John,</HI> and cleaving to the Bapti&s;m of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Six Principles</HI> thou mentione&s;t, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not declared what they are, it cannot be expected we &s;hould &s;peak to them at this time. But we recommend to thee that holy divine Principle of <HI REND="blackletterType">Light</HI> wherewith Chri&s;t <HI>lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</HI> Joh. 1. 9. <HI>In which Light the Nations of them that are &s;aved &s;hall walk,</HI> Rev. 21. 24.

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF TYTHES in General.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<P>THE only Command from God, that we read of in Holy Scripture, for the Payment of Tythes, was given by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in the time of the <HI>Levitical Law.</HI> Then God fir&s;t re&s;erved to him&s;elf the Tythe of the Land of Ca|naan, <HI>Lev.</HI> 27. 30. Which he did for this rea&s;on, that, intending to take the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> more peculiarly into his Service (as he did, <HI>Numb.</HI> 3. 6. in &s;tead of, or in exchange for all the Fir&s;t born of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> ver. 12. 13. and 45. and Chap. 8. ver. 18. Having before re|&s;erved and appropriated the Fir&s;t born to him&s;elf, <HI>Ex.</HI> 13. 2.) he might be&s;tow tho&s;e Tythes on the <HI>Levites,</HI> for and towards the Maintenance of that whole Tribe, as a Reward for their Service in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, <HI>Numb.</HI> 18. 21. 31. and in lieu of, and Compen&s;ation for, their Part or Share of and in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which thereupon they were expre&s;ly cut off from, ver. 20, 23, 24.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now although it was grounded on a Principle of Moral Ju&s;tice and Equity, that the <HI>Levites,</HI> thus engaged in a continual Attendance on a publick Ser|vice, and &s;hut out from their Share in the Inheritance of the promi&s;ed Land &s;hould receive a &s;ufficient
<PB N="18" REF="19">
Maintenance from them, for whom they performed that Service, and who enjoyed their Part of the Land: Yet the a&s;certaining of the <HI>Quot a</HI> of that Maintenance to the exact proportion of a <HI>Tenth Part</HI> of the Increa&s;e of the Land, was not grounded on Moral Ju&s;tice, but had its dependence on the Ceremonial Law, adapted and limited to the Polity of that Di&s;pen&s;ation and People only. And that it might not be extended be|yond its appointed Time and Bounds, it plea&s;ed the Di|vine Wi&s;dom, to &s;ubject it to &s;uch Ceremonial Cir|cum&s;tances, as plainly rank it among&s;t tho&s;e carnal Ordinances (Rites or Ceremonies) which were impo&s;|ed, but <HI>till the Time of Reformation,</HI> Spoken of <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 10. For as God appointed the <HI>Levites</HI> to be offered for a <HI>Wave-Offering,</HI> by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in the Name and on the behalf of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when he &s;aid to <HI>Mo&s;es, Thou &s;halt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and thou &s;halt gather the whole A&s;&s;embly of the Children of I&s;rael together; And thou &s;halt bring the Levites before the Lord, and the Children of I&s;rael &s;hall put their Hands upon the Levites: And Aaron &s;hall offer</HI> (in the Margin <HI>Wave) the Levites before the Lord, for an Offering</HI> (in the Margin, <HI>Wave-Offering) of the Children of I&s;rael; that they may execute the Service of the Lord,</HI> Num. 8. 9, 10, 11. So the Tythes, which were a&s;&s;igned for the Maintenance of the <HI>Le|vites,</HI> were to be fir&s;t offered, by the People, as an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> unto the Lord. (<HI>The Tythes of the Chil|dren of I&s;rael, which they offer as an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, I have given to the Levites,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Numb.</HI> 18. 24.) And even the Tythes of tho&s;e Tythes, which the <HI>Levites</HI> were to yield unto the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> were to be offered, by the <HI>Levites,</HI> as an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> to the Lord, before the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> might have them. <HI>Thus &s;peak unto the Levites</HI> (&s;aid God to Mo&s;es) <HI>and &s;ay unto them, When ye take of the Children of I&s;rael the Tythe which I have given you from them for your Inheritance; Then ye &s;hall offer up an Heave-Offering of it for the Lord, even</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="20">
<HI>a tenth Part of the Tythe. And this your Heave-Offer|ing &s;hall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the Corn of the thre&s;hing Floor,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Thus ye al&s;o &s;hall offer an Heave-Offering unto the Lord, of all your Tythes, which ye receive of the Children of I&s;rael: And ye &s;hall give there of the Lord's Heave-Offering to Aaron the Prie&s;t,</HI> ver. 26, 27, 28. This makes it evident, beyond doubt|ing, that the Tythes, which were given by the People to the <HI>Levites,</HI> and by the <HI>Levites</HI> to the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> un|der the Law, had their Dependence on the Ceremo|nial Law, as that Prie&s;thood had; And were to &s;tand no longer than that Law and that Prie&s;thood &s;tood: Which was but till <HI>Shiloh</HI> came, and by the Offering of him&s;elf once for all, had put an end to all the &s;ha|dowy Offerings under that Law.</P>
<P N="3">3. This the Author of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> did &s;o well under&s;tand, that he po&s;itively declared, that <HI>the Levitical Prie&s;thood being changed, there was made of Nece&s;&s;ity a Change al&s;o of the Law,</HI> (of that Law, by which that Prie&s;thood and the Maintenance of it had &s;tood) See <HI>Heb.</HI> 7. 12. And 'tis al&s;o evident from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity that neither the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves, nor (for &s;ome ages after them) any of the Chri&s;tians, did meddle with, or at all con|cern them&s;elves about Tythes; But let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated Part, <HI>viz.</HI> Offer|ings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. But after that the My&s;tery of Iniquity, which in the Apo&s;tles time began to work (2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2. 7.) had wrought to that Degree among&s;t &s;ome Chri&s;tians, and had drawn them &s;o far from the Purity and Sim|plicity of the Go&s;pel, as to form and model the Church in many things, by and according to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Pat|tern among&s;t other Ceremonial Parts of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion, which had been aboli&s;hed by the Coming and Death of Chri&s;t. Tythes were preached up again (about the latter end of the fourth Century, and be|ginning of the fifth) by &s;ome, at fir&s;t, under the No|tion
<PB N="20" REF="21">
of Alms and Charity (becau&s;e part of the Tythes under the Levitical Law, were appointed for the Maintenance of the Fatherle&s;s, the Widow and the Stranger, <HI>Deut.</HI> 14. 28, 29.) And by others, as then &s;till due by the Mo&s;aic Law, which had required them to be paid to the Levitical Prie&s;thood. Which Plea afterwards (Corruptions increa&s;ing in the Church, and in tho&s;e e&s;pecially who were called the <HI>Church-Men,</HI> or <HI>Clergy</HI>) more and more prevailing, the Payment of Tythes was re-introduced, as due by tho&s;e Levitical Laws, which had been given to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> of old. And upon that Bottom, Tythes have &s;tood, been claimed and the Claim defended unto this Day.</P>
<P N="5">5. Now, not only he that thus claims, and receives Tythes; but he that con&s;ents to, and complies with &s;uch Claim, by paying Tythes thus brought in, and thus claimed, doth thereby implicitly, and vertu|ally (at lea&s;t) deny that Chri&s;t has put an End to the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and con&s;equently that he is come, and hath &s;uffered in his Fle&s;h for Mankind. And that this may appear as plain as is po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hall draw the Matter into an Argument, thus: <LIST>
<ITEM>To uphold any Thing, as &s;till in force, which was to be taken away, and cea&s;e at and by the Death of Chri&s;t, is to deny that Chri&s;t is come and hath &s;uffered in his Fle&s;h for Mankind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>But to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to uphold a Thing, as &s;till in force, which was to be taken away, and cea&s;e at and by the Death of Chri&s;t:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore to receive, or pay Tythes now, is to deny that Chri&s;t is come, and hath &s;uffered in his Fle&s;h for Mankind.</ITEM>
</LIST> The <HI>Major</HI> mu&s;t be granted, and the <HI>Minor</HI> I thus prove.<LIST>
<ITEM>What&s;oever was <HI>a part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> was to be taken away, and cea&s;e at and by the Death of Chri&s;t;</ITEM>

But Tythes were a part of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore Tythes were to be taken away, and cea&s;e at and by the Death of Chri&s;t:</ITEM>
</LIST> The <HI>Major</HI> here again is unexceptionable; And the <HI>Minor</HI> is thus proved.<LIST>
<ITEM>Every <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> among the <HI>Jews</HI> was <HI>a Part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>But Tythes were an <HI>Heave-Offering</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> Num. 18. 24.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore Tythes were <HI>a Part</HI> of the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="6">6. By this it appears, that without regard had of the Per&s;on to whom, or the U&s;e for which Tythes are paid, the paying of Tythes (as well as the re|ceiving them) being <HI>a Part</HI> of the abrogated Ceremo|nial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> imports a denyal of the Coming, and Death of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Hence it is, that Tythes have been, and are commonly called <HI>Antichri&s;tian,</HI> or <HI>a|gain&s;t Chri&s;t.</HI> And hence hath ri&s;en that &s;aying (often u&s;ed not only by our antient Friends, but by &s;ome of the Martyrs long before) <HI>viz. He that pays Tythes, doth thereby deny that Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h.</HI> That Conclu&s;ion could not have been drawn, from the pay|ing of Tythes to a wrong Mini&s;try, or for a wrong u&s;e only, though &s;uch Payment be evil: Nor could any thing ju&s;tify that Inference, but the Con&s;idera|tion that Tythes, depending on the Ceremonial Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity and in cour&s;e fall, and cea&s;e when Chri&s;t &s;uffered; the paying of Tythes carries in it a &s;uppo&s;al, that that Law is not yet cea|&s;ed, but is &s;till in force: and con&s;equently that Chri&s;t, who&s;e Death mu&s;t needs have ended it, is not yet come, nor has yet &s;uffered in his Fle&s;h for Mankind.</P>

Wherefore having premi&s;ed what is &s;aid before concerning Tythes in general, to what Hand, or for what U&s;e &s;o|ever paid, let us now inquire into tho&s;e Tythes, which are called <HI>Impropriate.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of Impropriate <HI>TYTHES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT the&s;e Tythes, which are claimed by the <HI>Impropriators,</HI> are of the &s;ame Nature, and &s;tand originally on the &s;ame Root and Ground, on which the other Tythes &s;tand, which are claimed and exacted by the <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> is evident from hence, that they were all heretofore, the&s;e as well as tho&s;e, claim|ed by, and paid to &s;ome or other of the <HI>Romi&s;h Clergy,</HI> or their Appendices, the Religious Orders (&s;o called) and upon the &s;ame Foot. That is, The&s;e <HI>Impropriate Tythes</HI> were paid to tho&s;e Religious Orders or Hou&s;es, as being due to God, by vertue, of the <HI>Levitic-Law;</HI> as well as the other Tythes were paid to the <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts,</HI> on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ed Right, from the &s;ame Law. But how the&s;e Ththes came to tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es fir&s;t, and how afterwards from them to the <HI>Impropriators,</HI> is next to be inquired.</P>
<P>Until the <HI>Lateran Council</HI> (&s;o named, becau&s;e it was holden in the <HI>Pope's</HI> Palace at <HI>Rome,</HI> called the <HI>Lateran</HI>) in the Year 1215. It was in the choice of eve|ry Man to give his Tythes to what Church he plea&s;ed, &s;o he gave them to &s;ome Church. And even after that Council, the <HI>Popes,</HI> as Heads of that Church, by their di&s;pencing Power, did give leave to &s;uch as would &s;ue, and pay for it, to give their Tythes from the <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;t,</HI> to &s;uch Order of Religious People (whe|ther <HI>Monks, Friers,</HI> or <HI>Nuns</HI>) as they were be&s;t affected to. By which means, the <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts</HI> (called <HI>Seculars,</HI>)
<PB N="23" REF="24">
and tho&s;e of the &s;everal Religious Orders (called by a general Title, <HI>Regulars</HI>) being left to &s;cramble, as they could, for maintenance, the <HI>Regulars (mendicant Fryers,</HI> and others) &s;warming in all Places, and pre|tending, at lea&s;t, to greater Sanctity, and Au&s;terity of Life, than the <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts,</HI> prevailed with the People, either living or dying, to give not only very con&s;iderable E&s;tates in Lands, but al&s;o the Tythes of other Lands, and of whole Pari&s;hes, from the <HI>Pa|ri&s;h-Prie&s;ts,</HI> to their Religious Hou&s;es or Convents.</P>
<P>The Tythes, or Par&s;onages, &s;o given, were then called <HI>Appropriations,</HI> becau&s;e they were appropriated to this, that, or the other Religious Hou&s;e or Con|vent. And I have read, that there were in <HI>England</HI> about 3845 Par&s;onages thus appropriated. And as Tythes were then held to be <HI>due to God and holy Church;</HI> and tho&s;e Religious Orders were reputed a part of that Church: So the Tythes, as well as the Lands thus given them, were continued to them, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them, till that general Storm aro&s;e, in K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. his time, which overturned tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es and Orders together. And here, by the way, it may be noted, That while tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es &s;tood, a great part of the Lands which had been given to them, were, by Papal Authority, exempted from paying Tythes: Whence it is, that many of tho&s;e E&s;tates, which had belonged to tho&s;e Religious Hou&s;es, remain di&s;charged from the Burden of Tythes &s;till.</P>
<P>As Tythes were &s;et up here on the Authority of the <HI>Levitic Law,</HI> and in imitation of the <HI>Jewi&s;h Pra|ctice,</HI> con&s;onant to that Law: So while tho&s;e Reli|gious Hou&s;es &s;tood, and the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Power prevailed here, not only the <HI>Seculars</HI> or <HI>Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts,</HI> but all tho&s;e <HI>Regulars</HI> who received Tythes, were bound to pay the <HI>Tenths</HI> out of the Tythes they received to the Head of their Church, the <HI>Pope</HI> as the <HI>Levites,</HI> under the Ceremonial Law, were required to do to the Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>But after that K. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. (upon a Quarrel be|tween

<P>The Statute, which countenanced this Proceed|ing, is the 27. of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 28.
