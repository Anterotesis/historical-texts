<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE following pages are the fir&s;t efforts of a youthful mind, and was wrote purely for the Au|thor's amu&s;ement, and now fir&s;t collected and revi&s;ed, (with &s;uch alterations, additions, and improvements, as he thought
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
nece&s;&s;ary to make,) at the par|ticular reque&s;t of the young Lady, to whom the book is addre&s;&s;ed; though he thinks it but ju&s;tice to inform the readers, that many of the articles contained in this work, he has at different times in&s;erted in Magazines and other periodical publications; parti|cularly what he then called, Remarks on the Principal Per|formers; but as they were too precipitately written, he has wrote the following Ob&s;erva|tions on a more judicious and exten&s;ive plan, by &s;electing what u&s;eful matter he thought nece&s;&s;ary from the former, and having inter&s;per&s;ed it with what he has now written, by which,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
he flatters him&s;elf, this underta|king, (trifling as he is &s;en&s;ible it mu&s;t appear) wlll be thought far &s;uperior to the former; as he has given an account of all the Principal Performers that have appeared at either of the Thea|tres from the time he formerly &s;et out to the pre&s;ent Period. He has likewi&s;e added a CON|CLUSION, wherein the Me|rits and Demerits of mo&s;t of the inferior Performers are &s;et forth. Therefore, after &s;aying thus much, he has nothing more to plead to his courteous Readers, (nor to judge Critici&s;m, and his critical Court of Inque&s;t) than by declaring his &s;ole Motive for giving Birth to this Production,
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
was entirely to oblige the afore|&s;aid young Lady; with that View he humbly &s;ubmits it to Peru&s;al of the indulgent Public; at the &s;ame time hoping, the &s;ew auxiliary Forces he has been obliged to call in from other Au|thors, will be deemed Venial, and with humble Dependence on Candour and generous Cri|tici&s;m, he launches his little Pinnance, trembling from the Shore.</P>

<HEAD>DAVID GARRICK, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>_THE fir&s;t on the li&s;t of theatrical fame, &s;tands the inimitable Ro&s;|cius; one of the greate&s;t orna|ments that ever decked the Eng|li&s;h Stage; but who&s;e excellencies are be&s;t de&s;cribed in the words of his favourite and immortal poet <HI>Shake&s;peare.</HI></P>
<Q><L>He is a man take him for all in all,</L>
<L>We ne'er &s;hall look upon his like again. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HAMLET, Act I, Scene 2.</NOTE></L></Q>
<P><PB N="2" REF="25">
So many pens of almo&s;t all ranks and de|nominations in literature, for the&s;e thirty years pa&s;t, have been employed in treating of Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> both as an actor and a wri|ter; that I mu&s;t confe&s;s I find it a difficult ta&s;k to collect untouched materials; as &s;uch I &s;hall not at this time pre&s;ume to enter into the merit, or demerit, of this fir&s;t-rate ornament of the Briti&s;h Stage, for fear I &s;hould become a vile encroacher, and con|&s;equently make u&s;e of another man's pro|perty as my own: therefore, in order to a|void as much as po&s;&s;ible this ob&s;ervation, I &s;hall only give my courteous readers a de|&s;cription of his per&s;on; though at the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t beg leave to inter&s;per&s;e a little borowed matter, in order to &s;peak of him with more preci&s;ion than I probably might without the&s;e materials. But to his per&s;on, Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> though low in &s;tature, is regu|larly made, and well proportioned; his face is &s;trongly and finely featured, but on the whole not hand&s;ome; and yet, much le&s;s cannot be &s;aid to the contrary. His eyes have
<PB N="3" REF="26">
been ever and univer&s;ally admired; their cut is what a painter would call bold and perfect, their &s;ize is big, the pupil large, &s;trong, lively, active, and variable; their colour dark, &s;urrounded and &s;et off with a due proportion of white, that gives to their every motion, a brilliancy, a di&s;tinctne&s;s, a life that &s;peaks in every glance. His com|plexion is dark; and la&s;tly his voice, which, from its harmony, &s;weetne&s;s, and moreover from it's pliancy, and exten&s;ive variety, has ever been admired. Having given a brief and ju&s;t account of Mr. <HI>Garrick's</HI> per&s;on, I &s;hall proceed to relate the names of &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated characters this great actor &s;hines in; without attempting to en|ter into his excellence in any particular, for fear I &s;hould &s;uffer for my pre&s;umption, and run my account of this gentleman into a pro|lixity of u&s;ele&s;s and unmeaning matter; as &s;uch my intention is to touch upon Mr. <HI>Gar|rick,</HI> (as well as the following performers in general) in as true and conci&s;e manner as po&s;&s;ible. But I &s;hall proceed to relate a few
<PB N="4" REF="27">
of the various parts he is mo&s;t eminent in; which in tragedy are Macbeth, Lear, Ri|chard, Hamlet, Lu&s;ignan, Dorilas, &amp;c. &amp;c. In comedy, Able Drugger, Benedick, Kite|ly, Ranger, Archer, Don Felix, &amp;c. &amp;c. Were I capable of communicating to the reader, the names of all the various charac|ters Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> excels in, and likewi&s;e to point out his excellence in each particular part, it problably might &s;well to the &s;ize of a large volume; they are indeed &s;o nume|rous as to leave &s;ufficient room for me to make this remark; that in &s;hort, the mo&s;t explicit and accurate manner I can find in &s;umming up this gentleman's character as an actor, is by the following lines.</P>
<Q><L>The tragic mu&s;e, her laurel crown be&s;tows,</L>
<L>To fix it blooming on her GARRICK's brows;</L>
<L>The comic mu&s;e her ma&s;k has made his own,</L>
<L>And SHAKESPEARE lives, whil&s;t lives his Dar|ling Son.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="5" REF="28">
Having &s;aid thus much, on our Engli&s;h Ro&s;cius, I &s;hall conclude; and proceed to the next on the li&s;t at Drury-Lane theatre, which I believe is cordially allowed to &s;tand</P>

<HEAD>Mr. SMITH.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. SMITH is a very plea&s;ing and judi|cious actor; and in the parts of the unaffected well-bred gentleman, he irreproachably claims the foremo&s;t rank on the &s;tage, for uniform elegance, ea&s;e, and &s;uitable viva|city. His per&s;on is likewi&s;e one of the genteele&s;t that I know; and his whole de|portment admirably polite and affable. What a pity it is, that this actor &s;hould &s;o often mi&s;take his abilities, by &s;traying out of that road which nature has &s;o happily placed him in; did he retain le&s;s thoughts of his unfavourable mu&s;e Melpomene, and confine him&s;elf more to his be&s;t friend Thalia, I would in&s;ure his &s;ucce&s;s to be much greater than it is, as not one upon
<PB N="6" REF="29">
the &s;tage would have a chance to equal him in his walk: not but I mu&s;t allow Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> to have many capital requi&s;ites for a trage|dian, but he is apt to wade out of his depth; and were it not for his agility and good &s;en&s;e, I am per&s;uaded he would &s;ometimes be in danger of drowning: wherefore I greatly prefer in him the comedian to the tragedian; he is more &s;elf-bred, and has a greater variety in the former than in the latter; in tragedy he has too much levity, and wants expre&s;&s;ion, and his voice though clear and &s;onorous, wants variation; as he &s;carce ever &s;peaks but in one continual tone: yet he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great fervour and manly &s;pirit; particularly in his Richard, his Alexander, and the like; his Jachimo, his Phocyas in the &s;iege of Dama&s;cus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are inimitable; and his late attempt in Ore&s;tes in the Di&s;tre&s;&s;'d Mother, has de|&s;ervedly gained him no &s;mall &s;hare of ap|plau&s;e, being cha&s;te and re&s;pectable through|out the whole. And were there not quite &s;uch a repeated &s;amene&s;s in Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s
<PB N="7" REF="30">
action and voice, there would be no doubt of his becoming a very accompli&s;hed actor.</P>
<Q><L>Smith is at once the manly and genteel,</L>
<L>Feels all him&s;elf, and teaches all to feel. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I hope I &s;hall find this gentleman in future to merit this little encomium I have in&s;cribed to him&punc; and I wi&s;h I could with critical ju&s;tice declare it at pre&s;ent.</NOTE></L></Q>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Mr. REDDISH.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. REDDISH po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome &s;trokes of very con&s;picuous merit, though many de|grees inferior to a gentleman he a&s;&s;umes to equal, I mean Mr. Barry; yet vanity (I am told) has often prompted him to declare him&s;elf &s;econd to none but Mr. <HI>Garrick&punc;</HI> O! man, man, why art thou &s;o vain!&mdash;Till Mr. <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI> can dive&s;t him&s;elf of a &s;tiff, heavy figure, a &s;et face, and a broken mo|notony of voice, he may a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf the &s;eeing and &s;agacious public will rate him far
<PB N="8" REF="31">
inferior to the above gentleman. Mr. <HI>Red|di&s;h</HI> without doubt has a tolerable good &s;hare of judgment in his profe&s;&s;ion, whereby it renders him very u&s;eful in the various parts he performs; but with all the vanity he may po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf with, he never will be able to fill a fir&s;t form, at lea&s;t not at &s;uch a theatre as Drury-Lane; for in many characters he wants variety, likewi&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and a pliancy of features to exert his exterior powers: were he endowed with Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s features and voice, no doubt but he'd fall very little &s;hort of that gentle|man's abilities; but as dame Nature has not been &s;o favourable in adapting him with Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s theatrical requi&s;ites, I would advi&s;e him to content him&s;elf as he is, and not let ambition reign in his brea&s;t, for fear it &s;hould prove hurtful to him, as he never can prefume to reach capital excellence, except in a few particular parts, as Edgar, in Lear; Mone&s;es, in Tamerlain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherefore I am under the inde&s;pen&s;able ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="9" REF="32">
of rating Mr. <HI>Reddi&s;h,</HI> not as a very capital, but an exceeding u&s;eful performer.</P>
<Q><L>Reddi&s;h, forbear thy&s;elf to over-rate,</L>
<L>And let not vanity contaminate.</L></Q>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Mr. AICKIN.</HEAD>
<P>This actor's forte &s;eems to lie mo&s;tly in the impa&s;&s;ioned declamatory parts of tra|gedy, in which he without doubt de&s;erves notice. He has of late made &s;ome few at|tempts in comedy; but I cannot by any means admire him in the &s;ock; although his per&s;on and voice are both agreeable, yet he wants that natural ea&s;e and vivacity in his manner, &s;o peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary for the comedian, without which he never can render him&s;elf con&s;iderable in this; though there are &s;ome few parts wherein he makes a tolerable and decent appearance; as Stockwell in the We&s;t Indian, and Sir John Flowerdale in the School for Fathers; the&s;e being be&s;t &s;uited to his manner of acting;
<PB N="10" REF="33">
&s;o that take him altogether, from his judg|ment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the ca&s;t of parts he is in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of, he may be deemed a very u&s;eful and judicious actor.</P>
<Q><L>Aickin was &s;orm'd by judgment and by u&s;e,</L>
<L>Which &s;eldom fail &s;ome merit to produce.</L></Q>

<HEAD>Mr. KING.</HEAD>
<P>This favourite gentleman's out&s;et was in &s;ome of the country companies. After being tired with his country pur&s;uits, he came to London, and engaged him&s;elf at Drury-Lane Theatre, and what is very re|markable, Mr. <HI>King</HI> during the whole time of his engagement at this theatre, never was known once to fill a character that &s;eemed &s;uitable to his talents; this probably was the motive that induced him at that time to quit Drury-Lane, and engage him&s;elf
<PB N="11" REF="34">
under the banners of Mr. Sheridan in Ire|land; it being here where he broke out a co|median of the fir&s;t rank. He remained in Ireland for &s;everal years, but from a fracas happening among the principal performers of that theatre he quitted his &s;ervice like a valiant &s;oldier, and came over once more to general Garrick, where ever &s;ince he has continued to be one of the greate&s;t favou|rites on the &s;tage, by giving &s;uch repeated proofs of his excellent performance, as rank him (Mr. Garrick excepted) the be&s;t come|dian on the Engli&s;h &s;tage; take all in all, perhaps the be&s;t. And as a prologue &s;peaker in the comic &s;tyle, I would a&s;k where is his equal? (the above gentleman once more ex|cepted); he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in an eminent degree, that lively, &s;pirited, and quick &s;en&s;ation in his manner, which is &s;o admirably adapted for &s;peaking this kind of writing. But a|bove all, is that &s;ly knowledge of the world, which is &s;o excellently blended in Mr. <HI>King's</HI> features, and in his action, that it oftimes

&s;ends home effects to the furthermo&s;t and remote&s;t &s;eats of the galleries, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. MOODY.</HEAD>
<P>This performer's ju&s;tly admired abilities are in the parts of Iri&s;hmen; in tho&s;e cha|racters he has ro&s;e to eminence, being pro|&s;e&s;&s;edly the be&s;t exhibiter of Iri&s;hmen, now, on either &s;tage; and yet it is not only in Iri&s;hmen Mr. <HI>Moody</HI> excels, for he is likewi&s;e capital in many parts of low come|dy; I believe we may wi&s;h in vain for a bet|ter Commodore Flip, in the Fair Quaker of Deal; and Adam, in As you like It; or a Vamp, in the Author. There is con&s;idera|ble ea&s;e and propriety in his manner of ac|ting, e&s;pecially in his Iri&s;hmen; the&s;e cha|racters

<HEAD>Mr. DODD.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. DODD, in the genteel affected cox|comb, is certainly an original; and I am informed he is no le&s;s &s;o by nature is his private deportment, as well as on the &s;tage; if this circum&s;tance be true, we need not longer wonder at his excelling every other actor in this &s;pecies of comedy, as he doubt|le&s;s mu&s;t be quite at home in per&s;onating &s;uch characters. Though I have &s;een him with equal merit in &s;ome parts of low co|medy; as &s;uch, I &s;hould imagine Mr. <HI>Dodd</HI> has it in his power to be as much the Sir Gravity as the Sir Fopling: for in&s;tance,
<PB N="14" REF="37">
his Andrew Ague Cheek, in the Twelfth Night; his Cri&s;pn, in the Anatomi&s;t; and Old Kick&s;y, in the Iri&s;h Widow; are laugh|able in the highe&s;t degree. He is likewi&s;e exceeding u&s;eful in &s;everal &s;inging parts, having a tolerable good, though rather arti|ficial, voice. On the whole, Mr. <HI>Dodd</HI> will be found very acceptable in any theatre.</P>

as Fal&s;taff, Jaques, Sir Toby Belch, Caleban, Job&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> tho&s;e characters were be&s;t a|dapted to his unweildy figure, and more|over &s;uited to his manner of acting; his voice was &s;omewhat a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">matical, and a|bounded with many inharmonious tones; however he more than &s;upplied this defect, from his judgment and knowledge in his au|thors, &s;o that he was unequalled in his ca&s;t of parts. This actor was taken off this great &s;tage of life about twelve months &s;ince; his lo&s;s is regretted by all his admirers in his profe&s;&s;ion, and by alll tho&s;e who knew him to be an hone&s;t, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>

<HEAD>SPRANGER BARRY, ESQ;</HEAD>
<P>FEW people in the theatrical province, I believe, are ignorant that we are in|debted to Ireland for the birth of this gentle|man, and likewi&s;e to his early misfortunes that occa&s;ioned him to make an attempt on the &s;tage; a profe&s;&s;ion he certainly by na|ture was de&s;igned for, and where he has &s;hone for upwards of thirty years pa&s;t, with &s;o much profit to him&s;elf, and plea&s;ure to the public, as only to be rivalled by our Engli&s;h Ro&s;cius.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="56">
Mr. BARRY's fir&s;t out&s;et in this &s;phere of life was in the part of Othello, to the &s;urprizing &s;atisfaction and amazement of the general audience; for &s;ure never did young actor &s;hew &s;uch judgment in the choice of his fir&s;t part; he &s;eemed a fini&s;hed Othello (as Chetwood terms it) dropt from the clouds, which has ever &s;ince continued to be his favourite character; and if we take a &s;light &s;urvey of Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s features, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we need not wonder at his &s;ucce&s;s in this part. Fir&s;t, the graces of manly beau|ty which are &s;o favourably blended in his per&s;on; &s;econdly, the prodigious flexibility and harmony of his voice, which is &s;o ex|cellently adapted for the exhibition of Othello; in &s;hort, in this part and others I &s;hall mention, he is beyond critical excep|tion. For example, where is his equal in Jaffier, Romeo, and Ca&s;talio, he is not even &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the mighty chief Mr. <HI>Garrick;</HI> though I am extremely partial to that gentleman's abilities, yet ju&s;tice obliges me to make this ob&s;ervation, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="34" REF="57">
there are many &s;cenes in the two fir&s;t parts, in which Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI> eminently ex|cells: but upon critical examination, I be|lieve it will be generally allowed, through the whole cour&s;e of tho&s;e characters, Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> takes the lead: though to draw any &s;ort of parallel between tho&s;e two gentle|men would be beyond my judgment, and con&s;equently pre&s;umptive, therefore I &s;hall content my&s;elf with only making mention of a circum&s;tance of this &s;ort, and leave the re&s;t for &s;ome more able critic to pur&s;ue. As to Ca&s;talio, I don't at this time recollect an in&s;tance of Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s performing it; Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s &s;uperiority over any other actor in the lover's part, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t undoubtedly render him in this character matchle&s;s, from his amorous harmony of features, melting eyes, and unequalled plaintivene&s;s of voice, which are requi&s;ites &s;o peculiarly happy for forming the lover, that it is no wonder Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> &s;hould excell &s;o far be|yond any other performer in this province.
<PB N="35" REF="58">
I remember once to have &s;een this gentle|man in Romeo, particularly in the garden &s;cene of this favourite play, (where Juliet appears at the window) I thought he &s;poke the following lines incomparably fine, with a &s;yrenic &s;weetne&s;s of voice.</P>
<Q><L>See how &s;he leans her cheek upon her hand.</L>
<L>Oh! that I were a glove upon that hand,</L>
<L>That I might touch that cheek.</L></Q>
<P>And afterwards when Juliet replies, "Ah! me," then with what extacy he immediate|ly &s;poke the&s;e words:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;She &s;peaks! &s;he &s;peaks!</L>
<L>Oh! &s;peak again, bright angel, for thou art</L>
<L>As glorious to this &s;ight, being o'er my head,</L>
<L>As is a winged me&s;&s;enger from Heaven.</L></Q>
<P>In the parting &s;cene in the third act of this play, I likewi&s;e thought him exceeding picture&s;que and affecting, where he takes
<PB N="36" REF="59">
leave of Juliet in a &s;hort &s;entence, ending as follows:</P>
<Q><L>My life! my love! my &s;oul! adieu!</L></Q>
<P>He &s;eemed to penetrate the foregoing line into the hearts of the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;pec|tators: but what I mo&s;tly admired in Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s performance of this part, was the beginning of the tomb &s;cene, where Juliet wakes; here a tran&s;port of joy, love, and tenderne&s;s flows within him; with what acclamation and rapture he delivered this &s;entence:</P>
<Q><L>She &s;peaks! &s;he lives! and we &s;hall &s;till be ble&s;s'd!</L>
<L>My kind p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">opitious &s;tars o'er-pay me now</L>

There are many more beauties and ex|cellencies I could remark in Mr. <HI>Barry</HI>'s performances, in the pathetic and amor|ous; but being too long for the limits of my de&s;ign, they would appear tedious: all the imperfections I can di&s;cover about Mr. <HI>Barry</HI> is in his action, which is &s;ometimes rather flat and unmeaning to the true &s;en&s;e of his words, and likewi&s;e a &s;toop in his &s;houlders, and a bend in his knees, as if he was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hamed of his &s;uperior &s;tature, (as a critic ob&s;erves) and de&s;irous to level it to the common &s;tandard: but I forget that he is bordering on the vale of years, con&s;e|quently &s;uch blemi&s;hes as tho&s;e mu&s;t now be pardoned and forgiven.</P>

&s;uch as are not de&s;titute of merit, although annot be deemed as capitals; the fir&s;t of tho&s;e gentry &s;tands Mr. Lee Lewes, this per|&s;on is a thriving and plea&s;ing comedian; there is a &s;martne&s;s in his manner that mu&s;t one time render him con&s;iderable.

Mr. Dun&s;tall is a good low comedian, but like the preceding gentleman, too much of a mou|ther: notwith&s;tanding, his Hodge, and Sir Jealous Traffick, are inimitable, &s;uch cha|racters being happily &s;uited to his manner. Mr. Jeffer&s;on and Mr. Packer are u&s;eful men, the fir&s;t con&s;iderably the be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t in trage|dy, and pretty equal in comedy, though both bordering on the palm of in&s;ipidity.&mdash;Mr. Hull is a gentleman who under&s;tands

his author, and the drama, exceeding well, is very capable of &s;upporting paternal cha|racters, but for want of powers in other views, he is no ways important as an actor, though a very cha&s;te and re&s;pectable dra|matic writer. Mr Clinch and Mr Diamond, the&s;e two gentlemen &s;tarted the &s;ame &s;ea|&s;on at Drury-lane theatre, <HI>(i. e.)</HI> in October 1772, the one in Alexander the Great, the other in Romeo; Mr. Clinch has &s;ince pro|ved to be a Clinch, for he clinches &s;o voci|ferou&s;ly, that if he is not le&s;s violent, he will inevitably tear him&s;elf, and his parts to rags; therefore I would advi&s;e him not to be &s;o lavi&s;h with his &s;uperfluous fire and action, as by ob&s;erving this ob&s;ervation, he would bu&s;tle through his ca&s;t of characters with much more decency and applau&s;e than he u&s;ually does.

that character (con&s;idering his age, which was then but nineteen,) with tolerable ea&s;e and propriety: Mr. Diamond has left Drury-lane, but in what quarter of the globe he is at pre&s;ent, I will not pre&s;ume to fay. Mr Lacy; this gentleman made his appearance la&s;t winter in Alexander, but not meeting (in his attempt) with &s;o much pu|blic indulgence as was literally expected, he has, I believe, cordially relinqui&s;hed all thoughts of any future trial on the &s;tage. Mr. Melmoth; this ingenious per&s;on came out la&s;t benefit time, in the part of Cyrus, which character he went through with candid applau&s;e; he has &s;ince played Hamlet, and is far from being contempti|ble in it, having a very good knowledge of his author, and a ju&s;t conception of the part, and with a little cultivation of his talents, he may be enabled to make no incon&s;idera|ble &s;tand as a tragedian.

<L>Since you will drive me from you, I mu&s;t go;</L>
<L>But Oh! Monimia, when thou ha&s;t bani&s;hed me&punc;</L>
<L>No creeping &s;lave, though tractable and dull</L>
<L>As artful woman, for her end would chu&s;e,</L>
<L>Shall ever dote as I have done, for Oh!</L>
<L>No tongue my plea&s;ure nor my pains, can tell,</L>
<L>Tis Heav'n to have thee, and without thee Hell.</L></Q>
<P>Then after he has &s;poken the foregoing &s;entence, when his beloved Monimia is &s;o charmed with the mu&s;ic of his tongue, that &s;he forgives and pities him. Then what extatic joy flows immediate within him; with what rapture does the following &s;peech come from his mouth. But never
<PB N="72" REF="95">
more &s;o, than when it is delivered by the &s;weet, melodious, and expre&s;&s;ive voice, and manner of a Barry.</P>
<Q><L>Where am I, &s;urely paradi&s;e is round me,</L>
<L>Sweets planted by the hand of Heav'n grow here,</L>
<L>And ev'ry &s;en&s;e is full of thy perfection;</L>
<L>To hear thee &s;peak, might calm a madman's frenzy,</L>
<L>Till by attention he forgot his &s;orrows.</L>
<L>But to behold thy eyes, the amazing beauties,</L>
<L>Might make him rage again with love, as I do.</L>
<L>To touch thee's Heaven, but to enjoy thee, Oh!</L>
<L>Thou nature's whole perfection in one piece;</L>
<L>Sure framing thee, Heav'n took unu&s;ual care,</L>
<L>As it's own beauty, it de&s;ign'd thee fair,</L>
<L>And form'd thee by the be&s;t lov'd Angel there.</L></Q>
<P>The next and mo&s;t affecting circum&s;tance in this play is in the third act, after Ca&s;ta|lio's marriage with Monimia, when they confer together concerning enjoying at night their nuptial happine&s;s; <Q>which, after &s;ome intreaty, Monimia conde&s;cends, when
<PB N="73" REF="96">
all the family are at re&s;t, to let him into her chamber, when he, Ca&s;talio, by order of Monimia is to make a certain &s;ignal, (<Q>which is three &s;oft taps at the chamber|door</Q>)</Q> at which he is to gain admit|tance: but, alas! unhappily his brother Polidore li&s;tens, and over-hears the whole tenor of their appointment; therefore, not knowing of their marriage, Polidore is much chagrined at the thoughts of Ca&s;ta|lio's happine&s;s, he was going to reap with the fair Monimia. In con&s;equence, he contrives a plot to enjoy her if po&s;&s;ible him|&s;elf: accordingly he gets his little page Cordelia to go and trifle with Ca&s;talio in order to delay the time; in the mean while, he counterfeits his brother, and with the afore&s;aid &s;ignal gains entrance, and enjoys Monimia; &s;he at the &s;ame time mi&s;taking him for her lord Ca&s;talio.&mdash;Unfortunately, the poor fond adorer comes, according to his appointment made, glowing with rap|ture at the thoughts of his bli&s;sful night to come with his dear Monimia; but unhap|pily
<PB N="74" REF="97">
he is refu&s;ed admittance by the maid &s;ervant, being con&s;cious (as &s;he thought) &s;he let Ca&s;talio in before, and imagining the real hu&s;band to be the counterfeit Po|lidore. Who can behold &s;uch a &s;cene as this, without &s;haring in the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Ca&s;talio? and more e&s;pecially, when he lay down at the door almo&s;t di&s;tracted, think|ing it is Monimia's cruelty that has u&s;ed him thus.</P>
<P>In the fourth act, we &s;ee Ca&s;talio up|braid Monimia in the mo&s;t fervent manner po&s;&s;ible, for her &s;evere treatment, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, which &s;he is greatly &s;urpri&s;ed at, and well &s;he may be, when at the &s;ight of him &s;he flies with energy to his arms, ima|gining how happy &s;he was in his embraces the preceding night; at the &s;ame time, as I have ob&s;erved, it was the profligate Poli|dore. What &s;hould mo&s;t excite our feeling in this act, is to &s;ee the injured Monimia dragged like a dog by her beloved Ca&s;talio to the door, when he cruelly breaks from
<PB N="75" REF="98">
her with all the fiercene&s;s of a fiend; and afterwards when &s;he acquaints her brother Chamont, of the &s;evere and unexpected treatment which &s;he has received from her lord; at which, how chagrined and exa&s;|perated is Chamont for the injury done to his &s;i&s;ter, and vows vengeance on Ca&s;talio: with what exclamation he &s;peaks the fol|lowing lines to old Aca&s;to Ca&s;talio's father.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;I &s;ay my &s;i&s;ter's wrong'd,</L>
<L>Monimia my &s;i&s;ter, born as high,</L>
<L>And noble as Ca&s;talio,&mdash;do her ju&s;tice,</L>
<L>Or, by the Gods, I'll lay a &s;cene of blood,</L>
<L>Shall make this dwelling horrible to nature;</L>
<L>I'll do't&mdash;hark you, my lord, your &s;on Ca&s;talio,</L>
<L>Take him to your clo&s;et, and there teach him manners.</L></Q>
<P>With what unbounded excellence Mr. Garrick &s;peaks the above &s;entence; what contempt he &s;hews when he utters the la&s;t two lines, that &s;o elegantly di&s;covers how much he is di&s;plea&s;ed at the cruel u&s;age done
<PB N="76" REF="99">
to Monimia; that in &s;hort, this la&s;t &s;cene is exceeding natural and affecting.&mdash;The la&s;t act, at the ri&s;ing of the curtain, di&s;co|vers the unhappy Ca&s;talio lying on the ground in a &s;tate of lunacy, cur&s;ing Moni|mia, and all the incon&s;tant &s;ex of women, till a &s;ervant enters, and acquaints him, how wild and intemperate Monimia is for to behold her lord; at which he relinqui&s;h|es all of a &s;udden into love and tenderne&s;s for her. <Q>Soon after, Monimia enters, and after &s;ome conference together, &s;he tells him, <Q>She is re&s;olved from that day never more to &s;ee his face again</Q>:</Q> in what di&s;|tre&s;sful accents he immediately after &s;peaks this &s;entence:</P>
<Q><L>Where am I! &s;ure I wander 'mid&s;t enchant|ment,</L>
<L>And never more &s;hall find the way to re&s;t;</L>
<L>But, Oh! Monimia, art thou indeed re&s;olv'd</L>
<L>To puni&s;h me with everla&s;ting ab&s;ence;</L>
<L>Why turn'&s;t thou from me, I am alone al|ready;</L>

<L>And plea&s;e my&s;elf withal, whil&s;t my heart's breaking.</L></Q>
<P>Mrs. Barry, the original Monimia, I am told, always &s;hed tears at this beautiful, or rather bewitching pa&s;&s;age, as it may pro|perly be &s;o called; and afterwards when &s;he replied and exits, "Ah! poor Ca&s;talio," I have heard, in &s;peaking the&s;e three words &s;he has been &s;o much affected, &s;eeing at that in&s;tant the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation Ca&s;talio appeared to be in, that it was always &s;ome
<PB N="78" REF="101">
time before &s;he rightly could recover her|&s;elf; and dull mu&s;t be the apprehen&s;ion of the auditor that is not affected with &s;uch a &s;cene: notwith&s;tanding what we &s;ee is only feigned to us; yet, in all probability, the &s;tory from whence the origin of this tra|gedy was founded was true, wherefore, &s;uch an in&s;tance repre&s;ented &s;hould mo&s;t certainly excite our feelings. But, to pro|ceed, the cata&s;trophe of this play is very judiciou&s;ly wound up by the author, and abounds with a variety of incidents; for here we &s;ee the fall of Monimia, Ca&s;talio, and Polidore, and Chamont vowing de|&s;truction on Aca&s;to and all his hou&s;e, for the injury done his &s;i&s;ter. The conclu&s;ion is prodigiou&s;ly affecting, though our pity &s;hould only be re&s;erved for the good old father Aca&s;to, the injured Monimia, and the poor unfortunate &s;on Ca&s;talio; as the fall of Polidore &s;hould not in the lea&s;t affect us, he being nothing more than a mere pro&s;elyte of vice.&mdash;The author of this play (I believe it will be generally allowed by all
<PB N="79" REF="102">
impartial judges) wrote more immediately to the heart in painting the tender pa&s;&s;ions than any of his predece&s;&s;ors; or, in &s;hort, any of his cotemporaries, excepting Rowe' who in his productions comes the neare&s;t to Otway of any other dramatic author, either ancient or modern, particularly in his favourite tragedy of the Fair Penitent; where all the characters in this play are &s;upported with &s;o much judgment, and the language &s;o extremely elegant, as is the Orphan, that by the great re&s;emblance there is in the &s;tyle of the&s;e two plays, we might almo&s;t imagine them to be the pro|duction of one man: though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, Rowe in his dialogues is more cha&s;te and prai&s;e worthy than Otway; for the latter is in many in&s;tances indecent, and deficient of moral tendency, which the former &s;trictly confined him&s;elf to; for ex|ample, in the Orphan, Polidore's allu&s;ion of the bull is contemptible and ab&s;urd in the highe&s;t degree; and in the little page's cha|racter there are many indecencies, e&s;pecially

<HEAD>LETTER THE SECOND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mifs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING ever (as I told you in my la&s;t) devoted to your &s;ervice; I therefore, in compliance with your reque&s;t, a &s;econd time, and in order to fulfil my promi&s;e, have &s;ent you a few thoughts on the <HI>Fair Penitent</HI> accordingly.&mdash;The &s;ubject of this play is an excellent moral; it &s;hews in an eminent degree, the dangerous con&s;equence of parents forcing their children into mar|riage again&s;t their own inclinations; and
<PB N="82" REF="105">
paints nature in a very con&s;picuous manner. Mr. Wilkes in his general review of the &s;tage, remarks on this tragedy, that there is not one character in the whole play de|&s;erves compa&s;&s;ion; yet, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am of a different opinion: and he further ob&s;erves, the heroine of this play has no manner of right to the above title; <Q>that gentleman &s;ays, <Q>her grief does not &s;pring from compunction, but from a variety of pa&s;&s;ions which &s;he is prevented from gra|tifying:</Q></Q> probably he would have the play termed "The Penitent Pro&s;titute," which I think is far too gro&s;s a title, notwith&s;tand|ing &s;he yields to Lothario before her mar|riage with Altamont. In my poor opinion, I think her rather to be pitied, as many of her &s;ex, that would be &s;trictly virtuous, are liable to the &s;ame failing in the heat of blood, (as I plea&s;e thus vulgarly to term it) and e&s;pecially with a man &s;he &s;incerely loved. Is not Sciolto her father in the wrong, when he knows &s;he loves Lothario, to force her into marriage with another
<PB N="83" REF="106">
man whom &s;he has not the lea&s;t veneration for: though her hu&s;band is pa&s;&s;ionately doating of her, what is this&punc; to the purpo&s;e, when it is quite the rever&s;e with Cali&s;ta; for if both hearts do not mutually agree in the conjugal &s;tate, how is it po&s;&s;ible the parties can be happy? How many, like Cali&s;ta, have been deluded by the &s;oothing tales of the male &s;ex, and by their proffer|ing marriage, as Lothario did to Cali&s;ta, and afterwards deceived them. To be &s;ure, Lothario is a raki&s;h young gentleman, and like many more of the pre&s;ent age, when he has gained his ends, in enjoying the fair flame, he afterwards has no further regard; as Foote &s;ays, "When they are gratified, then they are &s;atisfied."</P>
<P>Therefore, dear Mi&s;s, (though my own &s;ex) be cautious how you li&s;ten to their al|luring enticements, for it is exceeding pre|earious tru&s;ting men, there being &s;o many &s;educers, that your &s;ex cannot have too great a guard over them&s;elves; and they
<PB N="84" REF="107">
have &s;o many wheedling and trepanning ways to decoy poor harmle&s;s and unthinking maids, by telling them (as Mackheath &s;ays) a hundred things which they never mean to perform, things that your &s;ex are apt to put too much confidence in: through which means, they &s;ometimes render them&s;elves a common prey to their lewd and abandoned de&s;ires, and then inevitable ruin con&s;e|quently en&s;ues: and at the &s;ame time, they not only reflect di&s;honour upon them&s;elves, but likewi&s;e bring much trouble and afflic|tion on their aged parents, that have taken great care and diligence in bringing them up to an age of di&s;cretion, and in hopes of &s;eeing them tread in the paths of virtue&punc; in|&s;tead of that, they too, too often fall a &s;a|crifice to their &s;potle&s;s virginity, (like the heroine of the foregoing play) by building their hopes on &s;uch a &s;andy foundation as perfidious men; as &s;uch they become the &s;coff and ridicule of all their former ac|quaintance, and are de&s;pi&s;ed by tho&s;e who before were their mo&s;t ardent friends, I
<PB N="85" REF="108">
could dwell with energy much longer on this &s;ubject, but being rather obliged to proceed with the few remarks I have to make on the play, it will be incon&s;i&s;tent and intruding on your patience: but before I proceed, I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed for the little I have &s;aid on the above topic, as my motive for inter&s;per&s;ing this matter, is en|tirely for the love of your future welfare&punc; as &s;uch, and for no other rea&s;on, was it wrote. But to the play. Though, does not Cali&s;ta after her marriage with Alta|mont reject all Lothario's offers with the utmo&s;t contempt, when he wants to enjoy her a &s;econd time, with tho&s;e words:</P>
<Q><L>How did&s;t thou dare to think that I would live,</L>
<L>A &s;lave to ba&s;e de&s;ires, and brutal plea&s;ures;</L>
<L>To be a wretched wanton for thy lei&s;ures,</L>
<L>To toy, and wa&s;te an hour of idle time with,</L>
<L>My &s;oul di&s;dains thee for &s;o mean a thought.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="86" REF="109">
In &s;hort, I think her all through the play, an object fully de&s;erving pity. As for the poor fond and gentle Altamont, I likewi&s;e pity his ca&s;e much, although the ill u&s;age he treats his friend Horatio with; for it is naturally to be &s;uppo&s;ed, he would put more confidence in the &s;tory the object of his heart related, than that which his friend told him, and e&s;pecially at a time he be|lieves her &s;potle&s;s. How often do we &s;ee a circum&s;tance of this kind among the lower cla&s;s of people, a man and his wife &s;hall quarrel, or what not, a friend comes and in|terferes in behalf of the parties: then af|terwards gets mo&s;t infamou&s;ly abu&s;ed for his civility. As for Sciolto the father, claims &s;carce any compa&s;&s;ion; as he may partly thank him&s;elf for all the &s;orrow and &s;hame he has brought on his old age; and I &s;incerely wi&s;h that every parent whom pro|vidence has endued with a family of chil|dren, would take warning by Sciolto's mi&s;|conduct,
<PB N="87" REF="110">
and not force them into marriage again&s;t their own con&s;ent; but as &s;ir Jea|lous Traffic, in the Bu&s;y Body &s;ays,</P>
<Q><L>By my example let all parents move,</L>
<L>And never &s;trive to cro&s;s their children's love;</L>
<L>They &s;hould &s;ubmit that care to providence above.</L></Q>
