<HEAD>FABLE I. THE RIVER WITH A PETITION.</HEAD>
<L>ACcording to the Romi&s;h creed,</L>
<L>I &s;peak of Rome two thou&s;and years ago,</L>
<L>The life that they &s;uppos'd the Gods to lead,</L>
<L>You would not chu&s;e to undergo.</L>
<L>Jupiter's bu&s;ine&s;s, day and night,</L>
<L>Was to attend with open ears and eyes,</L>
<L>And to write down, as fa&s;t as he could write,</L>
<L>All the impertinence that men devi&s;e.</L>
<L>Be&s;ides mens fopperies and ravings,</L>
<L>The women had &s;o great a &s;hare,</L>
<L>That their ab&s;urdities and cravings</L>
<L>Omnipotence alone could bear.</L>
<L>And furthermore, to try his patience,</L>
<L>He heard the prayers and fanciful di&s;tre&s;&s;es</L>
<L>Of all his children and relations,</L>
<L>And of his wife and his mi&s;-tre&s;&s;es.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20">Once on a time, if you'll believe tradition,</L>
<L>A river in great tribulation,</L>
<L>To Jupiter pre&s;ented a petition,</L>
<L>With an expo&s;tulating exhortation;</L>
<L>Whereby, if the petitioner's refus'd,</L>
<L>He has a right to think him&s;elf ill-us'd;</L>
<L>A form of prayer contriv'd for execution,</L>
<L>Exactly like a double-barrell'd gun,</L>
<L>Which if you fire with re&s;olution,</L>
<L>You have another chance when one is done,</L>
<L>So far from killing two birds with one &s;tone,</L>
<L>An art that's very little known;</L>
<L>All the petitioner de&s;ir'd to do,</L>
<L>Was to kill one with two.</L>
<L>Now this petition &s;hew'd how the petitioner,</L>
<L>For his fidelity, zeal, and devotion,</L>
<L>Had been appointed a commi&s;&s;ioner</L>
<L>Of the revenues of the Ocean,</L>
<L>Which he collected with great pains,</L>
<L>And &s;ent in good and current ca&s;h,</L>
<L>But, for his trouble and clear gains,</L>
<L>The Sea return'd adulterated tra&s;h:</L>
<L>Wherefore he pray'd,</L>
<L>Exhorted and &s;ubmitted,</L>
<L>That all the &s;ums the Ocean paid,</L>
<L>Shall for the future be remitted,</L>
<L>And i&s;&s;ued fair,</L>
<L>Without deba&s;ement or impair.</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21">Ungrateful Thames! the God replied,</L>
<L>Without that mixture and alloy,</L>
<L>Which the Sea pours into thee every tide,</L>
<L>Thy beauty and thy &s;trength would wear away.</L>
<L>Without his aid thou would&s;t remain</L>
<L>Like Tiber, or the poor pretending Seine,</L>
<L>Led thro' parterres, or rolled down a ca&s;cade,</L>
<L>Confin'd to vanity, and lo&s;t to trade.</L>
<L>'Tis thus the Highlander complains,</L>
<L>'Tis thus the Union they abu&s;e</L>
<L>For binding their back-&s;ides in chains,</L>
<L>And &s;hackling their feet in &s;hoes:</L>
<L>For giving them both food and fewel,</L>
<L>And comfortable cloaths,</L>
<L>In&s;tead of cruel oat-meal gruel;</L>
<L>In&s;tead of rags and heritable blows.</L>
<L>Luxury every day grows &s;tronger;</L>
<L>The Highland fair</L>
<L>Beholds her lover now no longer</L>
<L>Trotting with his buttocks bare.</L>
<L>Thus Doctor Brown was taken with the &s;pleen,</L>
<L>And fancied we were all undone,</L>
<L>Raving about a carpet and a &s;creen,</L>
<L>And out of temper with the &s;un:</L>
<L>Becau&s;e it is a crime,</L>
<L>As he &s;uppo&s;es,</L>
<L>For men to run in winter time</L>
<L>Into the &s;un to warm their no&s;es.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22">'Tis an egregious want of &s;en&s;e,</L>
<L>A want of ta&s;te, and want of &s;hame,</L>
<L>To fancy univer&s;al affluence</L>
<L>And luxury the &s;ame.</L>
<L>In &s;pite of Doctor Brown's di&s;cerning,</L>
<L>The term of univer&s;al will agree,</L>
<L>As well with his benevolence and learning,</L>
<L>As univer&s;al &s;uit with luxury.</L>
<L>He may perceive, if he be &s;o inclin'd,</L>
<L>Like his di&s;cernment, luxury's confin'd.</L>
<L>For as the gout torments the hands and feet,</L>
<L>To ea&s;e the nobler &s;tomach and the head,</L>
<L>So luxury, to gratify the great,</L>
<L>In&s;ults and robs the labourer of his bread.</L>
<L>Luxury in a &s;tate is a di&s;ea&s;e,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e 'tis partial, and ob&s;tructed wealth,</L>
<L>But univer&s;al affluence and ea&s;e</L>
<L>Is univer&s;al happine&s;s and health.</L>

<L>A Hen, one evening to enjoy the cool,</L>

<L>They ventur'd their whole &s;tock without en&s;uring,</L>
<L>Tru&s;ting to their oars and tackle.</L>
<L>The hen kept &s;colding like a drab,</L>
<L>Cur&s;ing her rebellious race;</L>
<L>We're not thy children, cried a pert young &s;quab,</L>
<L>If we were chickens, we &s;hould have more grace;</L>
<L>On Nature we depend,</L>
<L>Our cour&s;e &s;he &s;teers,</L>

<L><PB N="25" REF="27">Clo&s;e by the pond, an antient tower</L>
<L>Lifted its venerable head,</L>
<L>A college and &s;eque&s;ter'd bower,</L>
<L>Where owls for ages had been bred;</L>
<L>An old profe&s;&s;or, a great clerk,</L>

<L>Yon hen which you all hear,</L>
<L>In &s;uch a fright,</L>
<L>Undoubtedly affects that fear,</L>

<L>From the &s;ame principle, for the &s;ame end,</L>

<L>We &s;oone&s;t learn, and &s;eldome&s;t mi&s;take.</L>
<L>Hence that pathetic prayer, that tender call,</L>
<L>By which we get our wants di&s;patch'd,</L>

<L>A Cock, an officer of foot,</L>

<L>Where he did nought but crow and &s;trut,</L>
<L>And live by pillage.</L>
<L>Whene'er he had a mind</L>

<L>His robes and train, his &s;enatorial cap,</L>
