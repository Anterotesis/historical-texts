<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>O THOU WICKED SERVANT, I FORGAVE THEE ALL THAT DEBT, BECAUSE THOU DESIRED'ST ME: SHOULD'ST NOT THOU ALSO HAVE HAD COMPASSION ON THY FELLOW-SERVANT, EVEN AS I HAD PITY ON THEE?</P></Q>
<BIBL>MATT. xviii. V. 32, 33.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the frail, corrupt, and di&s;tru&s;tful &s;tate of human nature, when we reflect on the general lot and portion of mortality; when we call to mind how few things there are in this life which can impart real and &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s; and, on the other hand, how many are pregnant with mi&s;ery and &s;orrow, we are naturally led to imagine, that it mu&s;t be the bu&s;ine&s;s as it is the intere&s;t and concern of every individual to lighten as much as po&s;&s;ible the general burthen: That every office of tenderne&s;s and humanity to our fellow-creatures would of cour&s;e be duely and punctually per|formed by every one of us; well-knowing that all the poor aid and
<PB N="2" REF="5">
a&s;&s;i&s;tance which each particular could lend, would &s;till afford but &s;mall and in&s;ignificant pre&s;ervatives again&s;t univer&s;al affliction and calamity; as the mo&s;t that we can do is but to &s;often that di&s;tre&s;s which we cannot prevent, and to &s;ooth tho&s;e &s;orrows which we cannot remove.</P>
<P>And yet the general conduct and behaviour of mankind is directly contrary: It is indeed a melancholy truth, that for the mo&s;t part we employ our wit and &s;agacity but to over reach, our ingenuity to tor|ment, our riches and power to per&s;ecute and oppre&s;s each other.</P>
<P>In the parable now before us, our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, who applied it &s;olely to the purpo&s;e of inculcating mutual love, charity, and forgive|ne&s;s, informs us, that the benevolent king had generou&s;ly, on the humble petition of the poor in&s;olvent, withdrawn his ju&s;t claim to the whole debt, which was no le&s;s than ten thou&s;and talents; and yet this very &s;ervant would not afterwards forgive his fellow-&s;ervant one hundred pence, though mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;olicited by him, but ca&s;t him into pri&s;on: Then it was, &s;ays our Saviour, that his lord called him, and &s;aid unto him, <HI>O thou wicked &s;ervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becau&s;e thou de&s;ired'&s;t me: Should'&s;t not thou al&s;o have had compa&s;&s;ion on thy fellow-&s;ervant, even as I had pity on thee?</HI> The con&s;equence of this cruel and inhuman treatment of his unhappy brother was &s;uch, we are told, as the offender well de&s;erved: <HI>His lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he &s;hould pay all that was due unto him.</HI> The behaviour of the king's &s;ervant on this occa&s;ion, as related by our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, was not, we have rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, recorded by him as any thing &s;ingular or remarkable, but as a circum&s;tance that had frequently happened in times pa&s;t, and probably would but too often happen al&s;o in times to come; he well knew and fore&s;aw that the &s;ame unforgiving temper and di&s;po&s;ition, the &s;ame rancorous malevolence and inhumanity which had actuated the mind of one man,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
might afterwards corrupt the brea&s;ts, and influence the conduct, of thou|&s;ands; and of this there have been but too many evident proofs, in every age and nation, from the days of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles even unto our own.</P>
<P>For the honour of that nature which we partake of, for the intere&s;t and advancement of that virtue which we admire, and that holy religion which we profe&s;s, mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly and devoutly it were to be wi&s;hed that &s;ome method cou'd be found out effectually to pre&s;erve and &s;ecure the property of individuals, without &s;acrificing the liberty of one man to the arbitrary will or caprice, the anger and re&s;entment, the oppre&s;&s;ion and in&s;en&s;ibility of another: But human laws mu&s;t partake of human imperfections: even in the mo&s;t poli&s;hed and refined nations, (for the grievance is by no means confined to our own) puni&s;hments are often inflicted which are very inadequate to the crimes committed; and this is doubtle&s;s a hard&s;hip, more particularly to be lamented with regard to the <HI>In&s;olvent Debtor.</HI></P>
<P>The cruel confinement of a loath&s;ome dungeon, with all the horrors generally attendant on it, is doubtle&s;s by far too &s;evere a &s;entence on the unhappy delinquent; to be cut off at once from all the comforts and con|veniencies of life, to be &s;eparated, perhaps by brutal force and violence, from all that he holds dear, to be deprived of light and air, the com|mon benefits of nature, is &s;urely a dreadful and melancholy tran&s;ition; even when his incapacity of di&s;charging the debt is the con&s;equence of imprudence, &s;olly and extravagance; how much more pitiable is his condition when it &s;prings from unavoidable poverty and misfortune, from a total inability of providing for the exigencies of nature, and the nece&s;&s;ities of human life! Perhaps even &s;ometimes, and it is a cir|cum&s;tance not uncommon, from the ba&s;ene&s;s, fraud or impo&s;ture of tho&s;e with whom he is connected, who take advantage of his ea&s;y na|ture to delude and impo&s;e upon him: how many have been immured for
<PB N="4" REF="7">
their whole lives in a pri&s;on, from their imprudent readine&s;s and alacrity in &s;erving tho&s;e whom they mo&s;t lov'd and e&s;teem'd, by becoming &s;urities for their friends and relations! how many have procured the peace, happine&s;s and liberty of others, at the dear expen&s;e of their own!</P>
<P>When we add to this, what mu&s;t frequently be the ca&s;e, that the un|happy &s;ufferer is burthen'd with a numerous and helple&s;s family, that the tree which is thus bla&s;ted is at the &s;ame time bent down with the weight of its own branches; when the innocent are thus inevitably in|volv'd in the &s;ame puni&s;hment with the guilty, when at the very cri&s;is that the wretched parent wou'd mo&s;t wi&s;h for the power to a&s;&s;i&s;t his children, he is deprived of every means to &s;upport them, when the fountain of indu&s;try, that only &s;ource from whence the waters of com|fort cou'd flow, is dried up in a barren wilderne&s;s, how doth the me|lancholy &s;cene &s;well with complicated mi&s;ery! In this dreadful &s;ituation he is left, delivered over, as the king's &s;ervant was, to the tormentors; confined perhaps within the &s;ame walls, fed with the &s;ame &s;canty pittance, and doom'd to the &s;ame ignominous treatment as the ruffian, the felon and the murderer. <HI>Their</HI> fate, indeed, is more eligible than <HI>his,</HI> guilt alone excepted; their confinement is &s;hort and determined, and death is ready, like a kind friend, to fini&s;h their days and their mi&s;eries together; whil&s;t the unhappy debtor, who langui&s;hes for years in a dark and dreary dungeon, dies a lingering death, and drags on a wretched being, in lengthen'd &s;hame and protracted mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>When indeed we con&s;ider the variety of evils ari&s;ing to individuals, as well as the many inconveniencies felt by the community from this &s;ingle circum&s;tance, we are utterly at a lo&s;s to account for the &s;mall degree of attention which hath hitherto been paid to it; more e&s;pecially when we call to mind that there is &s;carce any &s;pecies of di&s;tre&s;s, which the benevolence of this charitable age and nation hath
<PB N="5" REF="8">
not already endeavoured to relinqui&s;h or remove, we cannot but won|der that amid&s;t all the complaints brought to the ears of the great, the <HI>&s;orrowful &s;ighing of the pri&s;oners</HI> did not &s;ooner <HI>come before them;</HI> that, where there are &s;o many good <HI>Samaritans,</HI> the&s;e <HI>wounds</HI> were not <HI>bound up</HI> and <HI>healed.</HI> The only probable cau&s;e to be a&s;&s;igned, perhaps, is, that what we our&s;elves do neither &s;ee nor feel is &s;eldom the object of our enquiry or con&s;ideration; the cries of poverty are every day heard, bodily pains and di&s;ea&s;es, accidents, and misfortunes of various kinds are frequently &s;een, and &s;ometimes experienced by per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank and fortune; the&s;e therefore the hand of charity hath been &s;tretched forth to &s;often and relieve; but few, very few among&s;t the rich and great, have followed the unhappy debtor into his captivity, or vi&s;ited tho&s;e man&s;ions of grief and &s;orrow which he is doom'd to inhabit; the evil which was not generally known, could not be generally attended to, nor could it be expected that the af|flictions and calamities which were not &s;een, could be &s;o &s;peedily or &s;o effectually removed.</P>
<P>The time, however, is at length come, thanks to the great in&s;pirer of every good word and work, when the groans of the oppre&s;&s;ed captive have reached the ears of the merciful, and pierced the hearts of the benevolent. To take away that reproach of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and inattention which I ju&s;t now mentioned, to counteract the malevolence of &s;ome, the hard|ne&s;s of heart and in&s;en&s;ibility of others, to free the captive and &s;ave the wretched; for the&s;e noble and truly glorious purpo&s;es, was framed that humane and truly excellent in&s;titution which we this day meet to encourage and &s;upport; a laudable and generous de&s;ign which calls for our warme&s;t zeal to recommend, and merits our heartie&s;t endeavours to|wards the furtherance and improvement of it.</P>
<P>Already hath this our age and nation been &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed by its numerous acts of goodne&s;s and beneficence: as the many &s;chools,
<PB N="6" REF="9">
ho&s;pitals and foundations in it do mo&s;t abundantly te&s;tify: There wanted, as it were, but this one wing to fini&s;h and complete the great temple of Charity; that &s;uperb and magnificent &s;tructure which will immortalize our name, and tran&s;mit Briti&s;h compa&s;&s;ion and hu|manity to the admiration of future ages. With regard to the parti|cular in&s;titution I am here to recommend, whether we con&s;ider the benefits re&s;ulting from this charity to individuals, or the advantages that will ari&s;e to &s;ociety, whether we con&s;ider it as di&s;pen&s;ing private happine&s;s or promoting public utility, a more truly pious and u&s;eful work, the good, the benevolent and the charitable could never be engaged in.</P>
<P>The di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of this excellent plan, and which &s;eems to gild it with a &s;uperior lu&s;tre, is, that it is at once an act both of ju&s;tice and of mercy; whil&s;t it imparts its welcome bounties to the unfortunate <HI>debtor,</HI> it &s;atisfies the legal claims of the <HI>creditor</HI> al&s;o: Whil&s;t the light &s;trikes upon, and is directed to, one object, the re|flection as it were illuminates another; it not only, as common flowers in the garden of Charity, delights the &s;en&s;e by the grateful odour peculiar to it, but, like the perfumes of the Ea&s;t, diffu&s;es &s;weetne&s;s and fragrance on every &s;ide of it; not only doth the unhappy pri&s;oner recover his freedom when a&s;&s;i&s;ted by us, but whenever it happens, as it frequently doth, that, on a &s;trict and careful inve&s;tigation of every circum&s;tance, the creditor is him&s;elf found to be in an indigent and di&s;tre&s;sful condition, the whole debt is generou&s;ly di&s;charged; thus the relief of <HI>one</HI> is made &s;ub&s;ervient to the happine&s;s of <HI>both,</HI> and the ble&s;&s;ing is doubled by the mutual participation of it.</P>
<P>But, moreover, whil&s;t this excellent Charity is &s;o in&s;trumental to pri|vate relief, it isno le&s;s &s;ub&s;ervient to the public welfare: The want of hands in every branch of commerce and manufacture is every day felt and lamented by us; and yet we &s;uffer numbers of the mo&s;t able and vigorous to wa&s;te away their youth and &s;trength in a pri&s;on, where, like withered
<PB N="7" REF="10">
boughs, they are <HI>hewed down,</HI> as it were, and <HI>ca&s;t into the fire:</HI> How meritorious then, how prai&s;e-worthy is that benevolence which reflores the&s;e u&s;eful members to &s;ociety, which enables them once more to exert their powers and abilities in their &s;everal callings and profe&s;&s;ions, and to become profitable &s;ervants of that community to which they belong: <HI>When thus we ca&s;t our bread upon the waters, after</HI> not many <HI>days it returneth unto us.</HI></P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to this humane and benevolent in&s;titution (and where is that good work which hath not met with oppo&s;ition) it hath been &s;ugge&s;ted by &s;ome, that it may afford encouragement to the idle and unprincipled to contract &s;uch debts as will thus kindly be di&s;charged for them; that the relief thus con&s;tantly admini&s;tered, will dimini&s;h the apprehen&s;ions and le&s;&s;en the terrors of a pri&s;on, and con&s;equently render men more carele&s;s of their behaviour; that it even lays it&s;elf open to fraud and collu&s;ion between the vicious and immoral, and that debtor and creditor may connive together to &s;hare the advantages re|&s;ulting from the&s;e charitable donations: But the&s;e are fal&s;e, weak and ill-grounded &s;ugge&s;tions, which every day's experience, &s;ince the in&s;titution of this charity, hath enabled us to gain&s;ay and confute. It is impo&s;&s;ible, perhaps, for human wi&s;dom to guard again&s;t all the arts which may be practi&s;ed by the cunning and deceitful to counteract its benevolent purpo&s;es: Every caution, however, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, hath been made u&s;e of to prevent fraud and impo&s;ture, and in the relief of objects the &s;tricte&s;t attention always paid, and the fulle&s;t bounty always be&s;towed on tho&s;e who were mo&s;t de&s;erving of it. It is very ea&s;y for men of affluent fortunes, who never felt the griping hand of penury, to boa&s;t of their punctual and regular di&s;charge of every ju&s;t and legal demand upon them, and no le&s;s ea&s;y
<PB N="8" REF="11">
is it for &s;uch (as is too often the ca&s;e) to deal forth liberal invectives again&s;t the wretched in&s;olvent, who is deficient in that duty which they have &s;o con&s;tantly performed; but little, alas! do they con&s;ider what the ruthle&s;s command of that tyrant Nece&s;&s;ity might have obliged them to; little do they reflect how hard the &s;truggle may &s;ometimes prove in the hone&s;t and con&s;cientious mind, between the powerful plea of pre&s;&s;ing indigence, and the &s;tinging reproaches of forfeited ju&s;tice and integrity.</P>
<P>On the mo&s;t &s;trict and candid examination into the merits of tho&s;e who are intitled to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of this charity, it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged, to the honour of human nature, that among&s;t all the mi&s;erable objects confined in the walls of a pri&s;on, many are indebted for their wretched &s;ituation there, to unavoidable misfortune; many to venial errors, folly and imprudence; many, mo&s;t of them indeed, to the cruel and unfeeling di&s;po&s;ition of their mercile&s;s creditors; but few, very few, to what is too often a&s;cribed as the cau&s;e of it, a total want of principle and common hone&s;ty: This heighth of depravity and cor|ruption, to &s;ay the truth, is generally the portion of tho&s;e who figure in higher life, of tho&s;e, who, though they have never been condemned to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> the mi&s;eries of a pri&s;on, have notwith&s;tanding mo&s;t amply <HI>de&s;erved</HI> it.</P>
<P>Our laws, we know, have been &s;aid (and there is perhaps but too much truth in the compari&s;on) to re&s;emble tho&s;e nets or toils which entangle the &s;maller bea&s;ts of prey, but are at the &s;ame time too weak and feeble to hold fa&s;t the &s;trong and powerful which are driven into them: How el&s;e, indeed, could it happen, that the poor, de&s;titute and friendle&s;s In&s;olvent Debtor is torn to pieces by the cruel fangs of
<PB N="9" REF="12">
ju&s;tice, that he &s;uffers all the rigor which an unrelenting creditor can inflict upon him, for a &s;mall and incon&s;iderable debt; whil&s;t the in&s;olent and fraudful bankrupt, who has ruin'd thou&s;ands, &s;hall &s;talk in open day-light untouch'd and unaba&s;h'd, laugh at his oppre&s;&s;ed, helple&s;s creditors, and bid defiance to law, ju&s;tice, and humanity.</P>
<P>But let us leave the&s;e infamous plunderers to what is wor&s;e than pri&s;ons or death, the reproaches of their own con&s;cience; to tho&s;e <HI>tormentors</HI> let us deliver them, and turn our eyes towards objects far more de&s;erving of our attention; towards the meek and humble, the &s;ober and the diffident, the wretched and the oppre&s;&s;ed, who &s;tretch out their hands to us for &s;uccour, and pray unto us for light and liberty: Tho&s;e, alas! who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this glorious trea&s;ure, &s;eem, as it were, in&s;en&s;ible of its worth; and the true value of this, as of almo&s;t every other ble&s;&s;ing, is &s;eldom known 'till we feel the want of it; it is &s;carce credible, my brethren, to how many, in &s;o &s;hort a time, we have already, by means of this excellent in&s;titution, been able to di&s;pen&s;e this great and noble gift; but true Charity, like true beauty, to be admired need but to be &s;een, the clo&s;er it is examined and with the nicer &s;crutiny it is enquired into, the more lovers and followers will it always attract: It will not &s;urpri&s;e you, therefore, but it will give you infinite plea&s;ure to hear, that within the &s;hort &s;pace of twelve months la&s;t pa&s;t, upwards of twelve thou&s;and pounds hath already been paid or compounded for from the benefactions of this Society; whole families re&s;cued from want, mi&s;ery and de&s;peir, and a number of u&s;eful and indu&s;trious members re&s;tored to the com|munity. Mu&s;t it not, my brethren, expand your hearts with benevo|lent chearfulne&s;s, to reflect that you have &s;pred joy and happine&s;s over the minds of &s;o many of your fellow-creatures? are you not thus amply
<PB N="10" REF="13">
repaid for all the trouble of your &s;olicitous enquiries, for all the expen&s;e of your collections, and all your labour in the di&s;tribution of them?</P>
<P>The power of life and death is doubtle&s;s a truely great and noble, and therefore a <HI>Royal</HI> prerogative; and yours, my brethren, who contribute to this charity, de&s;erves the next place in honour and dignity: To di&s;pen&s;e the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of this life to our fellow|creatures, is almo&s;t as di&s;tingui&s;hing a privilege as to prolong life it&s;elf, which indeed without this is &s;carce worthy of our acceptance. By contributing to this excellent charity, by taking upon you, my brethren, this kind, this benevolent, this pious office, you re&s;emble a &s;uperior order of beings; you re&s;emble, in the noble&s;t of their perfections, tho&s;e mini&s;ters of the Almighty, the holy angels of God, who came to deliver his cho&s;en Apo&s;tle from captivity: as &s;oon as you enter into the gloomy regions of &s;lavery, the darkne&s;s gradually recedeth from them, the <HI>light &s;hineth in the pri&s;on,</HI> the iron doors open of their own accord, and you &s;ay to the wretched and de&s;pairing captive, who looks with wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment upon you, as the Angel did unto Peter: <HI>Gird thy&s;elf, and bind on thy &s;andals, ca&s;t thy garment about thee, and follow</HI> US.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, in whatever light we view this ami|able in&s;titution, which ever &s;ide of the building we turn towards as, it &s;trikes us with fre&s;h plea&s;ure, and ri&s;es upon uswith re|doubled lu&s;tre: Shall we not endeavour then to re&s;t it on a firm and &s;olid foundation? Many mi&s;erable and di&s;tre&s;sful objects have already been relieved; but more, many more, are every day and every hour appealing to our compa&s;&s;ion, and &s;oliciting our bounty; &s;hall we not li&s;ten to the cries of the poor, and hear the voice of the appre&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14">
Let us then, my brethren, like the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nil actum reputans &s;i quid &s;upere&s;&s;et agendum.</NOTE>Roman conqueror of old, think nothing yet <HI>done,</HI> whil&s;t any thing remaineth <HI>undone;</HI> any thing at lea&s;t which it is in our power to perform. Tho&s;e who are ble&s;&s;ed with affluence, health, and pro&s;perity, are bound by every tie of gratitude to con&s;ider the wants and &s;orrows of the &s;ick and needy; and tho&s;e who enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of ea&s;e and freedom, &s;hould look with an eye of tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion on the pains and mi&s;eries of captivity.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider then, my brethren, I be&s;eech you, the wretched condition of the unfortunate debtor, more particularly, my beloved, con&s;ider and reflect upon it at this <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">This Sermon was preach'd when the weather was remarkably fine.</NOTE>genial, fertile, and benignant &s;ea&s;on, when every ray of light diffu&s;eth joy and gladne&s;s, when every gale is im|pregnated with health and plea&s;ure; at &s;uch a time &s;hall we not ca&s;t a thought towards the poor confined pri&s;oner, &s;hut up from that refre&s;h|ing air which we breath, and deprived of that reviving light which we rejoice in; &s;hall we not willingly abridge our&s;elves of any little &s;uperfluous &s;en&s;ual gratification to promote a fellow-creature's freedom, to communicate that plea&s;ure which we po&s;&s;e&s;s, to impart that hap|pine&s;s which we our&s;elves enjoy.</P>
