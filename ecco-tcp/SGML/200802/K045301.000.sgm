<HEAD>SCRUB'S TRIP TO THE JUBILEE. SPOKEN BY MR. WESTON.</HEAD>
<L>FROM Stratford arriv'd&mdash;piping hot&mdash;gentle folks,</L>
<L>From the rare&s;t fine &s;hows and mo&s;t wonderful jokes,</L>
<L>Your &s;imple acquaintance, Scrub, comes to declare</L>
<L>'Twas fuller by far than our Litchfield great fair,</L>
<L>Such crouds of fine ladies, &s;erenading and &s;inging</L>
<L>Such firing of loud pateraroes and ringing,</L>
<L>To tell it in London mu&s;t &s;eem all a fable</L>
<L>And yet I will tell it as well as I'm able:</L>
<L>Fir&s;t &s;omething in linguo of &s;chools call'd an ode;</L>
<L>All critics they told me allow'd very good,</L>
<L>One &s;aid&mdash;you may take it for truth I a&s;&s;ure ye</L>
<L>'Twas made by the little great man of old Drury,</L>
<L>By my brother Martin&mdash;for who&s;e &s;ake d'ye hear,</L>
<L>This night I'd a mind for a touch at Shake&s;peare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This alludes to Mr. We&s;ton's intention of playing Richard.</NOTE>.</L>
<L>But hone&s;tly &s;peaking I take more delight in</L>
<L>A bit of good fun, than drums, trumpets and fighting.</L>
<L>The Proce&s;&s;ion, 'twas &s;aid, would have been a fine train;</L>
<L>But could not move forwards&mdash;oh la, for the rain.</L>
<L>Such tragical, comical folks and &s;o fine&mdash;</L>
<L>What pity it was that the &s;un did not &s;hine,</L>
<L>Since ladies and baronets, aldermen, &s;quires,</L>
<L>All went to this Jubilee full of de&s;ires,</L>
<L>In crouds as they go for to &s;ee a new play</L>
<L>And when it was done&mdash;why they all came away.</L>
<L><PB REF="4">Don't let me forget&mdash;a main part of the &s;how</L>
<L>Was long tailed fine comets by fam'd Angelo,</L>
<L>Some turtle I got which they call'd pa&s;hapee&mdash;</L>
<L>But hone&s;t roa&s;t beef's the be&s;t turtle for me.</L>
<L>I hate all ragouts, and, like a bold Briton,</L>
<L>Prefer good plumb pudding to ought I e'er bit on.</L>
<L>I drank too&mdash;and now I a poet may be&mdash;</L>
<L>From a charming fine cup of the mulberry tree.</L>
<L>To bed I mu&s;t go&mdash;for which like a ninny</L>
<L>I paid&mdash;like my betters&mdash;no le&s;s than a guinea.</L>
<L>For rolling&mdash;not &s;leeping&mdash;in linen &s;o damp</L>
<L>As &s;truck my great toe ever &s;ince with the cramp,</L>
<L>Thus fleec'd&mdash;in my pocket I felt a great &s;marting</L>
<L>Yet griev'd not when I and the &s;plinters were parting,</L>
<L>'Twas worth ten times more to hear &s;weet brother Martin.</L>
<L>He &s;poke till poor Scrub was ju&s;t fit, with one eye</L>
<L>To laugh, while the other was ready to cry:</L>
<L>Which makes me now tell you without any brag</L>
<L>He's &s;econd to none but the Warwick&s;hire wag.</L>
<L>The Jubilee over, I come to this place</L>
<L>To tell you my &s;tory and &s;ue for your grace.</L>
<L>You never refus'd it&mdash;yet never before</L>
<L>With granting &s;uch kindne&s;s bound gratitude more.</L>

<P>Lard, madam! there is &s;uch a variety, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to advi&s;e. When I lived with lady Bab.

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a gentleman, Sir, and not u&s;ed to abu&s;ive language. To &s;peak of my&s;elf may not be &s;o pro|per, but my father, Sir Robert Planwell, was

generally known and e&s;teemed in the North of England.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir</HI> CHARLES</SPEAKER>
<P>If he did not, I do, Sir; I have employed all my &s;pare ca&s;h the&s;e five years in the &s;tocks. Why, Sir, I have wrote two letters, dated India, to come over land, by Holland, one of which will rai&s;e that &s;tock twenty per cent. and the other fall it thirty. Now, Sir, if you will countenance my preten&s;ions to your daughter, I'll kill Heyder Ally, and make him conquer Madra&s;s, as often as you plea&s;e to &s;ell out or buy in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SCRAPEALL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if that's the ca&s;e, you may be a hopeful young fellow: but I hate a title. Howevever, if you can make what you &s;ay appear&mdash;</P>
