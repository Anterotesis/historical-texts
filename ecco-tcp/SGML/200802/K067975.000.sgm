<HEAD>THE LEGISLATIVE INDEPENDENCE OF IRELAND VINDICATED; IN A <HI>SPEECH of Mr. SHERIDAN's On the Iri&s;h Propo&s;itions in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons.</HI> On MONDAY, the 30th of MAY, 1785.</HEAD>
<P>MR. SHERIDAN ro&s;e, as the que&s;tion was going to be put, and &s;aid, that as the per&s;evering &s;ilence of Mini|&s;ters made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to gue&s;s whether they meant to admit the amendment in the fourth Propo&s;ition or not; and as they had pur&s;ued the &s;ame conduct in rejecting the amendment moved by a noble Lord near him, which he had the honour of &s;econding, he would take the opportunity of &s;peaking to the Re&s;olution generally as it had been framed, and defended by the Mini&s;ter, before it &s;hould become &s;till more objectionable, by extending the powers it was to lodge in Great-Britain over the &s;i&s;ter kingdom. This, at lea&s;t, Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, was a que&s;tion on which Gentlemen were no longer to hear the <HI>de|&s;ires and wi&s;hes of Ireland</HI> urged as arguments for their concur|rence; it was a matter wholely and entirely new; it was &s;o far from being any part of the offer made by Ireland, that it had never even been hinted at, or alluded to, in the Iri&s;h Par|liament; it never had been once glanced at by Mr. Orde; it formed no part of the con&s;ideration recommended to the atten|tion of the Parliaments of both kingdoms in his Maje&s;ty's gra|cious Speech from the throne; it was not to be found in the que&s;tions referred to the inve&s;tigation of the Committee of Privy-Council, and the Rt. hon. Gentleman him&s;elf (Mr. Pitt)
<PB N="4" REF="4">
in opening this bu&s;ine&s;s to the Briti&s;h Parliament had not ut|tered one word that tended to &s;hew that this Propo&s;ition was e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ettlement propo&s;ed between the two kingdoms. The que&s;tion then was, whether the new Propo&s;ition, now in debate, contained matter fit to be propo&s;ed from the Parlia|ment of this country to the Parliament of Ireland? In his con|&s;cience he thought it did not;&mdash;it was injurious to make the offer, and it was folly to believe it could be accepted; it was not enough to &s;ay that the Parliament of Ireland <HI>ought</HI> not or <HI>dared</HI> not agree to it; they had not the powers to accede to it;&mdash;it would be a conce&s;&s;ion beyond the limits of their tru&s;t; they would betray the confidence repo&s;ed in them, and the Iri&s;h nation would &s;purn at the bondage which their degene|rate repre&s;entatives had no authority to engage they &s;hould &s;ubmit to. Much had been argued on a former day relative to the extent and &s;pirit of this Propo&s;ition. The event and con|clu&s;ion of all tho&s;e arguments from both &s;ides of the Hou&s;e, warranted him now in a&s;&s;erting, that this Re&s;olution went, in the fulle&s;t extent, to a complete re&s;umption of the right of ex|ternal legi&s;lation &s;o lately exerci&s;ed, but &s;o &s;olemnly renoun+ced, by Great-Britain over Ireland. It was unnece&s;&s;ary to re|peat tho&s;e arguments. No Per&s;on would again attempt to maintain that this was a mea&s;ure of experiment, or that it was in the power of Ireland to po&s;&s;e&s;s her&s;elf of the greate&s;t pre|&s;ent benefits from this country, which &s;o many Gentlemen con|tended &s;he would immediately obtain, as a transfer of Briti&s;h capital, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Briti&s;h manufactures; and then, by refu&s;ing to place upon her Statute-book &s;ome act of this Legi&s;lature which &s;he was bound to have adopted, void and annul the whole of this &s;ettlement, and revert unmole&s;ted to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation. A full explanation had been given on this &s;ubiect, the conclu&s;ion from which went di&s;tinctly to this: that the pre&s;ent &s;ettlement was final and perpetual. That the contracting parties in this momentous bu&s;ine&s;s being pre&s;umed to act with perfect fore&s;ight of the con&s;equences of their irre|vocable engagements, neither party could depart from any ar|ticle &s;tipulated, without breach of faith. Such an infraction in the &s;tronger power, would be an act of de&s;poti&s;m and op|pre&s;&s;ion, and would ju&s;tify the utmo&s;t extent of re&s;&s;i&s;tance; in the weaker, it would be a direct attempt to di&s;engage her|&s;elf from all connection with or relation to the empire, and would authorize the vigour of coercion. This was the footing
<PB N="5" REF="5">
upon which the two countries mu&s;t in future be under&s;tood to be united. Upon this view it would be an impo&s;ition on com|mon &s;en&s;e to pretend that Ireland could in future have the ex|erci&s;e of free will or di&s;cretion upon any of tho&s;e &s;ubjects of legi&s;lation, on which &s;he now &s;tipulated to follow the edicts of Great-Britain; and it was a mi&s;erable &s;ophi&s;try to contend, that her being permitted the ceremony of placing tho&s;e laws upon her own Statute-book, as the form of promulgating them, was an argument that it was not the Briti&s;h, but the Iri&s;h &s;tatute, which bound the people of Ireland. For his part, if he were a Member of the Iri&s;h Parliament, he &s;hould prefer the mea&s;ure of enacting, by one deci&s;ive vote, that all Briti&s;h laws, to the purpo&s;es &s;tipulated, &s;hould have im|mediate operation in Ireland as in Great-Britain; choo&s;ing rather to avoid the ignominious mockery of enacting without deliberation, and deciding where they had no power to di&s;|&s;ent; where &s;etters were to be worn, it was a wretched am|bition to contend for the di&s;tinction of fa&s;tening our own &s;hackles.</P>
<P>If this was a fair con&s;truction of the purport and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the Re&s;olution, was it a light and trifling con|&s;ideration, when we reflected on the &s;olemn and deci&s;ive man|ner in which the faith of the two countries had been engaged on this &s;ubject? whether Great-Britain &s;hould in&s;idiou&s;ly, by &s;urpri&s;e, and collaterally, as it were, make a propo&s;al, which would argue to her a repentance of the bounty, or rather of the ju&s;tice, which &s;he had done to Ireland; and which, if not accepted, would nece&s;&s;arily de&s;troy for ever all confidence in that country towards Great-Britain on tho&s;e great con&s;tituti|onal que&s;tions, which he had &s;hewn were &s;o near to her brea&s;t, and &s;o valuable above all other advantages &s;he had either claimed or acquired? It had been &s;olemnly &s;tipulated be|tween the two kingdoms, that <Q REND="inline">"the right claimed by Ireland, to be bound in all ca&s;es whatever, only by laws made by the King, Lords, and Commons of Ireland, &s;hould never more be que&s;tioned, or que&s;tionable."</Q> This Re&s;olution did not que&s;tion that right. No; certainly it did not; it only offered to bargain for it, and propo&s;ed conditions on which the right was to be relinqui&s;hed for ever by Ireland. But who are the parties ne|gotiating, and under what circum&s;tances is the treaty carried on? A final commercial arrangement is declared to be nece&s;|&s;ary to the future good under&s;tanding between the countries;
<PB N="6" REF="6">
and this final arrangement it is declared by Britain to be an in|di&s;pen&s;able condition that Ireland &s;hould give up all legi&s;lative authority in matters of trade and navigation; and this condi|tion is not fairly put forward in the out&s;et of the treaty, but Ireland is treacherou&s;ly encouraged to demand a benefit, and then a price is exacted greater than any favour Britain can be|&s;tow, while by the manner of granting it, Ireland is at the &s;ame time given to under&s;tand, that there can never be peace or cordiality between the two countries, till &s;he acquie&s;ces in the &s;acrifice. When a &s;trong power, con&s;cious of its &s;uperio|rity, treats with a weaker one upon &s;uch terms; it may not <HI>que&s;tion</HI> indeed the right to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion wi&s;hed for, but it does more, it hints a menace on the con&s;equence of with|holding it; the letter of the compact is not infringed, but the &s;pirit of it is violated. Here Mr. Sheridan &s;aid, he would not enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, whether it was not rea&s;onable in any Admini&s;tration, at any time, to entertain an apprehen&s;ion, that great difficulties might ari&s;e in the government of two countries, each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an independent legi&s;lature, e&s;pecially in matters of commerce and navigation. To argue theoreti|cally on &s;uch a &s;ituation, undoubtedly many apprehen&s;ions might be ju&s;tifiable; but what had been the event? It had not proved them to be well-founded; but whatever fears were en|tertained on the &s;ubject, this he was &s;ure of, that the only mode of treating with Ireland in a point of &s;uch magnitude, was by fair, explicit, and ingenuous plain-dealing. If the Briti&s;h Government really thought it e&s;&s;ential to the future good under&s;tanding, and to the common intere&s;ts of the two kingdoms, that the power of legi&s;lating to particular objects &s;hould be lodged in one kingdom, only for the common bene|fit of both, and of con&s;equence in that kingdom which was the head of the empire, it &s;hould have been di&s;tinctly &s;o &s;ta|ted in the front and out&s;et of the fir&s;t overture made to the Iri&s;h Parliament, as the ba&s;is of a permanent agreement. If then, upon due deliberation, and full communication with their con&s;tituents and with the country at large, the Parliament of that kingdom had thought it advi&s;eable, and had been au|thori&s;ed to treat for the &s;urrender of tho&s;e rights which they had &s;o lately deemed the only &s;afeguard, either of their com|merce or of their con&s;titution, and which they gloried &s;o much to have obtained by their own virtues and &s;pirited exer|tions; then undoubtedly whatever he might have thought of
<PB N="7" REF="7">
their prudence, he &s;hould not have held him&s;elf at liberty to make the &s;ame comments on the proceeding. In&s;tead of this, all had been delu&s;ion, trick, and fallacy; a new &s;cheme of commercial arrangement is propo&s;ed to the Iri&s;h as a boon, and the &s;urrender of their con&s;titution is tacked to it as a mer|cantile regulation. Ireland, newly e&s;caped from har&s;h tram|mels and &s;evere di&s;cipline, is treated like a high mettled hor&s;e, hard to catch; and the Iri&s;h Secretary is to return to the field, &s;oothing and coaxing him, with a &s;ieve of provender in one hand, but with a bridle in the other, ready to &s;lip over his head, while he is &s;nuffling at the food. But this political jockey&s;hip, he was convinced, would not &s;ucceed; Ireland would &s;purn at any offer to which &s;uch a condition was to be annexed! &s;he would now plainly &s;ee that this alarming condi|tion, now indeed declared to be the e&s;&s;ence and vital principle of the whole &s;ettlement, though introduced as an after|thought, as it were, and as a con&s;equence of the tenor of the requi&s;itions made by Ireland, was no doubt the fir&s;t original object, and contained the &s;eed and &s;ource of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. He was the more confirmed in this opinion, from recollect|ing many pa&s;&s;ages in the Rt. hon. Mover's &s;peeches, &s;ince he fir&s;t opened this matter; although it was not then thought pru|dent even to hint that &s;uch a &s;tipulation &s;hould be part of the treaty, he con&s;tantly made it a topic of accu&s;ation again&s;t his Rt. hon. Friend (Mr. Fox) that he had permitted Ireland to a&s;&s;ert the freedom of her con&s;titution, unconditionally, and without re&s;erving to Great Britain, a nece&s;&s;ary controul over her trade and navigation. Here Mr. Sheridan went into a full defence of the conduct of his Rt. hon. Friend on that occa&s;ion, he reminded the Hou&s;e of the circum&s;tances of the times, the &s;ituation in which Ireland then &s;tood, and maintained that the declaratory &s;tatute which Ireland demanded to be repealed, was more di&s;graceful to the Journals of that Hou&s;e, and more a libel on the principles of this country, than injurious to the people it in&s;ulted; but was there a man in that Hou&s;e who would &s;tand up and &s;ay, that conditions ought to have been made with Ireland, annexed to this conce&s;&s;ion, if a conce&s;&s;ion it could be called? Was there a man who &s;tated this to be his opi|nion at the time? If the Rt. hon. Gentleman who &s;o frequently repeats this charge, has to plead in his excu&s;e, that he was not THEN po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that political fore&s;ight, and con&s;ummate &s;agacity which three years experience had given him, how
<PB N="8" REF="8">
came it, that his new ally, the Rt. hon. Gentleman by his &s;ide (Mr. Jenkin&s;on) who&s;e prudence and abilities were certainly not immature at that time, &s;o far de&s;erted his duty, as ne|ver to prote&s;t, while the mea&s;ure was in its progre&s;s, again&s;t the indi&s;cretion and ra&s;hne&s;s of a Mini&s;ter, whom he had no rea&s;on to &s;avour, nor once to warn him, that he was incon&s;ider|ately placing the two countries in a &s;ituation, in which it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;tand, and inducing Parliament to re|linqui&s;h a right, which it would be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary, on the fir&s;t opportunity to re&s;ume; fortunately for the peace and future union of the two kingdoms, no &s;uch mi&s;erable and narrow policy entered into the mind of his Rt. hon. Friend; he di&s;dained the inju&s;tice of bargaining with Ireland on &s;uch a &s;ubject, nor would Ireland have li&s;tened to him if he had attempted it. She had not applied to <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> a con&s;titution, and if a tribute or contribution had been demanded in return for what was then granted, tho&s;e patriotic &s;pirits who were at that time leading the oppre&s;&s;ed people of that in&s;ulted coun|try, to the attainment of their ju&s;t rights, would have point|ed to other modes of acquiring them, would have called to them in the words of Camillus, <HI>arma aptare atque ferro non auro patriam et libertatem recuperare.</HI></P>
<P>But if he had been &s;urprized at this &s;ort of language coming from tho&s;e Gentlemen, he had been much more a&s;toni&s;hed, at another Rt. hon. Gentleman's declaration (Mr. Grenville) that when he had been in an official &s;ituation, in Ireland, he had wi&s;hed for, and meditated a &s;ettlement between the two countries, upon the principle of the pre&s;ent propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tem. Had the Rt. hon. Gentleman forgot the &s;econd legi&s;lative act pa&s;&s;ed by this Parliament, in acknowledgment of the Con&s;ti|tutional rights of Ireland? Had he forgot that that act was a mea&s;ure of his admini&s;tration? and did he remember the &s;o|lemn pledge, there given, to remove for ever all doubt that any power but the King, Lords, and Commons, of Ireland, &s;hould dictate in a legi&s;lative capacity to that country? The Rt. hon. Gentleman had &s;tated, that this act had become ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary, for that Ireland, almo&s;t to a man, had con|ceived that the &s;imple repeal of the 6th of George the Fir&s;t, had not re&s;tored to them the &s;ecurity of their con&s;titution, which yet remained to be acquired, if this was the ca&s;e, and a bargain were nece&s;&s;ary, then was the time for the Rt. hon. Gentleman to have propo&s;ed his conditions, and not to have
<PB N="9" REF="9">
permitted tho&s;e for whom he obtained this new acknowledg|ment, to have conceived him to have been the champion for a more &s;olemn and explicit renunciation of the legi&s;lative claims of Great Britain over Ireland, if he had in his mind a re&s;erve, that a &s;ettlement was even then nece&s;&s;ary, which &s;hould re|a&s;&s;ert tho&s;e claims, and degrade Ireland to her former &s;tate of &s;ervile dependance.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;tate of Ireland, it was ridiculous to argue that any circum&s;tances had &s;ince occurred to ju&s;tify or call for the pre&s;ent arrangement. It had been attempted to be proved in the Report of the Committee of Privy Council that Ireland had begun to &s;hew a ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition towards Great Britain, and that &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed two or three acts, impo&s;ing duties on &s;ome articles of Briti&s;h export. It was idle to rea&s;on from &s;uch trivial circum&s;tances. One or two of the&s;e acts, it was known, had pa&s;&s;ed the Iri&s;h Parliament rather by &s;tealth and through inadvertency. No material principle upon which the two countries were to remain connected, had been violated; and when we con&s;idered the perpetual &s;hifting of the govern|ment and &s;y&s;tem in Ireland, that every three months wa&s;ted over a new Lord Lieutenant, the only wonder was that tho&s;e principles had been &s;o &s;teadily adhered to. The clamour and riots of Dublin had al&s;o been re&s;orted to as pretences for this arrangement; this &s;ort of argument had been &s;ufficiently repro|bated by a Rt. hon. Friend of his (Mr. Burke) on a former day, but if clamour was to be attended to, let the meaning of it, where there was any, be preferred to the noi&s;e. Had the Iri&s;h clamoured for the pre&s;ent &s;ettlement, or for any one article contained in it? Had they been loud in demanding acce&s;s to the Briti&s;h market in preference to protecting duties? Had they reque&s;ted to be tied for ever to the Briti&s;h monopoly in the We&s;t Indies, and to have the price of the commodities of tho&s;e Colonies increa&s;ed upon them. Had they complained that fortune had offered the trade of the United States of America to them without condition or re&s;traint? Had they vehemently expre&s;&s;ed their apprehen&s;ions, that the rich com|merce of the Ea&s;t would &s;peedily be open to them, if effectual mea&s;ures were not taken to prevent it? Had they regretted that they were burthened with a &s;urplus of the hereditary re|venue? Had they called out, that they were tired of their Legi&s;lative Independence, and intreated to be relieved from it? But the fallacy of &s;tating &s;uch flim&s;y ground, as the &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="10" REF="10">
cry of the populace, as the real origin and &s;pur of this important arrangement, was too obvious to be commented on. The true &s;pring and incentive to this artful and complicated bu&s;ine&s;s evidently lurked in this fourth pernicious Re&s;olution, the tendency of which, was of a piece with their whole &s;y&s;|tem of Government in Ireland, with the arbitrary and illegal proceedings of their agents in the bu&s;ine&s;s of attachments, with their attacks on the liberty of the pre&s;s, mea&s;ures arguing a mind ho&s;tile to the true principles of con&s;titutional freedom, and ju&s;tifying us in pre&s;uming that &s;imilar &s;teps would be pur&s;ued in this country, if they could be practi&s;ed with equal impunity.</P>
<P>Mr. Sheridan now adverted to what the noble Lord in the Blue Ribband (Lord North) had &s;aid, was his conception of the &s;pirit of the Propo&s;ition then in debate. The noble Lord had very fairly &s;tated, that it was unque&s;tionably a <HI>propo&s;al</HI> on the part of the Briti&s;h Parliament, that Ireland &s;hould, upon certain conditions, &s;urrender her now acknowledged right of <HI>external legi&s;lation,</HI> and return as to that point to the &s;ituation from which &s;he had emancipated her&s;elf in 1782. The noble Lord had al&s;o added, that though he might not approve of the manner and circum&s;tances under which this offer was made, yet he &s;incerely hoped, that Ireland would forget both, and perceive her intere&s;t in acceding to the propo&s;al. The noble Lord was right in &s;aying, that Ireland mu&s;t <HI>forget</HI> before &s;he could <HI>con&s;ent;</HI> but &s;he had more to forget than the in&s;idious and unfair manner in which this propo&s;al come to her; &s;he mu&s;t forget that Great Britain ever had the power now re|quired to be conceded to her; &s;he mu&s;t forget the u&s;e Great-Britain made of it while &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. And by what ar|guments is Ireland to be induced to relinqui&s;h this right? Can it be &s;tated to her, that &s;he has ever once exerci&s;ed it to the injury of this country? No, but we are told, that it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;he may do &s;o; and is it not equally po&s;&s;ible that Great Britain may abu&s;e the tru&s;t, and employ this power to the oppre&s;&s;ion of Ireland? It is argued that the malice of party, the intere&s;ted views of mercantile &s;peculation, or the folly of narrow politicians, may, at &s;ome time or other, lead Ireland, even at the expence of her own intere&s;t, to mea&s;ures which might embarra&s;s the trade and navigation of the Em|pire. And has Ireland nothing to apprehend from party, from mercantile avarice, or from blind and narrow policy? If it is urged that England is grown too liberal and enlighten|ed
<PB N="11" REF="11">
to ju&s;tify any &s;uch apprehen&s;ions on the part of Ireland, the Chancellor of the Exchequer him&s;elf contradicts this rea|&s;oning, by a&s;&s;erting, that the two hundred thou&s;and manufac|turers who&s;e petitions are on the Table, are all influenced either by the &s;ugge&s;tions of faction, or blinded by prejudice and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; in truth, there is not a &s;ingle argument which can be u&s;ed as an inducement to Great Britain to attempt to re&s;ume this power, which does not equally apply as a motive to Ireland not to part with it, with this difference only, that fact and experience will ju&s;tify the refu&s;al of the one, but have afforded no pretence for the requi&s;ition from the other.</P>
<P>But this power, if returned to Great Britain, is to be re|turned with this qualification. The laws which Ireland is to be bound to adopt and to obey, are <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'to enforce the &s;ame re&s;|traints, and to confer the &s;ame benefits upon the &s;ubjects of both countries.'</Q> Here then ari&s;es a que&s;tion which will ne|ce&s;&s;arily be duly weighed and duly con&s;idered by the Iri&s;h. Is it, or is it not po&s;&s;ible for Great Britain, under the title of <HI>Laws for the Regulation of Trade and Navigation,</HI> or for <HI>regu|lating and re&s;training the Trade of the Briti&s;h Colonies and Plan|tations,</HI> to adopt re&s;trictions and enforce conditions which may materially cripple and embarra&s;s the trade and navigation of Ireland without proportionably affecting the commerce of Great Britain. He took upon him confidently to a&s;&s;ert, that this might be done in innumerable particulars. He had &s;tated for example &s;ake &s;ome in&s;tances upon a former day; he had &s;tated that Great Britain might re&s;train the trade and naviga|tion between the Colonies and the&s;e kingdoms to ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burthen and a proportionable number of &s;eamen. England has large &s;hips and numerous crews, Ireland has nei|ther. The advantage of Ireland has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be her making more frequent voyages to the Plantations and for &s;mall|er cargoes. Such a mea&s;ure of legi&s;lation as is alluded to, would evidently have a different operation on the commerce of the two Countries. He had &s;tated, that Great Britain re|&s;erving the power of pre&s;cribing the form of original certifi|cates to be given by the Revenue Officers of the Colonies, and of requiring them to accompany the importation of every ar|ticle of Colonial produce, imported from Ireland into Great Britain, might, by limiting the time at which they &s;hould be allowed, and by various other means entangle and di&s;tre&s;s the Iri&s;h Trader, and the more &s;o, as the re&s;traint was not even
<PB N="12" REF="12">
to be reciprocal. He had &s;tated, that Great Britain might make it a condition, that no &s;hip &s;hould clear out a cargo from the We&s;t Indies, which did not take out a &s;tipulated quantity of &s;ome Briti&s;h manufacture not to be obtained in Ireland; but it was unnece&s;&s;ary for him to multiply or argue upon examples. If he was wrangled out of one ca&s;e, &s;till the principal he went upon was not defeated, for he was not to be called upon to prove the probability of the in&s;tances he quoted, or that Great Britain would not injure her&s;elf were &s;he to adopt them, becau&s;e the whole of the pre&s;ent arrangement was built upon this foundation, that it was e&s;&s;ential to the &s;y&s;tem that neither country &s;hould retain a power upon any terms to injure the commerce of the other.</P>
<P>But whether it was probable or not that Great Britain would in future exerci&s;e this right of external legi&s;lation over Ireland with ju&s;tice and liberality, &s;hutting her ears to preju|dice and &s;elf-intere&s;t, &s;till it mu&s;t be admitted, that it was claiming a con&s;iderable &s;acrifice from the &s;i&s;ter kingdom; and what were the advantages held out to her to induce her to make this &s;acrifice? He wi&s;hed the Hou&s;e to view the whole of this matter, and not to confine their attention to the &s;ubject of the Briti&s;h market, which had been argued upon as if there was nothing el&s;e to be conceded by one &s;ide or acquired by the other. What was the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Ireland in re&s;pect to all branches of commerce, independent of her intercour&s;e with this kingdom? Here Mr. Sheridan went into a more minute detail, than it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to pur&s;ue, in order to &s;hew the &s;ituation in which Ireland now &s;tood, in re&s;pect to her trade with our Colonies and with Foreign Countries, and that in which &s;he was propo&s;ed to be placed, &s;hould the &s;y&s;tem of arrangement at pre&s;ent in contemplation, be adopted.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the We&s;t Indies, Ireland was to agree to forego every market, but that of the Briti&s;h Plantations, to give up the cheape&s;t for the deare&s;t, to lo&s;e the option &s;he at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of being &s;upplied circuitou&s;ly through Great Britain upon the low duties, if &s;he found it not to her advantage to apply to the direct trade for the whole of her con&s;umption, to double her pre&s;ent duties on the article of rum, to impo&s;e not only equal port duties upon her exports, but to countervail every internal duty, which Great Britain may impo&s;e upon any &s;imilar article of her own manufacture, &s;o that if Great Britain was to lay a duty upon the export of
<PB N="13" REF="13">
her linen to tho&s;e Colonies, which would be of little injury to her, Ireland mu&s;t do the &s;ame, though the rever&s;e would be the con&s;equence; in &s;hort, the whole was &s;acrifice and &s;ur|render on the part of Ireland.</P>
<P>As to America, the difference lay in a word. In&s;tead of a trade to that whole Continent without re&s;triction or duty, but what &s;he &s;hould think proper her&s;elf to impo&s;e, &s;he was to admit into her ports no articles of &s;imilar growth, produce, or ma|nufacture, to tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h Colonies, or which were li|able to be imported from thence as &s;uch, but upon the terms that Great Britain &s;hould hereafter dictate. With Africa, &s;he was to be placed upon the &s;ame footing as with the We&s;t In|dies, and for India, &s;he was to abandon all hope and pro&s;pect of intercour&s;e with tho&s;e countries to the end of time, and con&s;ent that an immoveable boom &s;hould be placed from the Cape of Good Hope to the Straits of Magellan. Thus re|&s;trained and dependent, her pro&s;pects of European commerce were to be proportionably dimini&s;hed; the&s;e &s;acrifices could not be di&s;puted; and it was to be con&s;idered that every article propo&s;ed to be abandoned by Ireland, was an advantage to which her title was not di&s;puted, an advantage that &s;he held as a right, for which &s;he had a claim to compen&s;ation if re|linqui&s;hed.</P>
<P>The&s;e then being the &s;acrifices which Ireland was to make in her pro&s;pects of an extended foreign commerce, where was to be her retribution? In what in&s;tance was the advantage in this treaty to be on her &s;ide? From whence was &s;he to receive the boa&s;ted compen&s;ation? The BRITISH MARKET&mdash;that was to be opened to her. <HI>There,</HI> and <HI>there</HI> only, was &s;he to look for an equivalent for the numerous and important &s;acrifices &s;he was to make both in commerce and con&s;titution. He defied any man to have the confidence to deny, for a moment, that in every other in&s;tance Ireland was not to be placed in an infinite|ly wor&s;e &s;ituation than that in which &s;he now &s;tands, and in which &s;he &s;tands by fair and acknowledged right. But how was this advantage to be given to her? Upon what terms was the Briti&s;h market to be opened? If he was to adopt the lan|guage and &s;entiments of tho&s;e who propo&s;e this boon, he &s;hould an&s;wer, upon &s;uch terms as &s;hall effectually prevent Ireland from ever profiting, in the &s;malle&s;t degree by the con|ce&s;&s;ion. To this point, all their arguments had tended: to this, all their evidence had been pointed; &s;o that if we were
<PB N="14" REF="14">
to give credit to the Mini&s;ter, and his &s;upporters, this <HI>equita|ble</HI> treaty, this bargain upon the ba&s;is of <HI>reciprocity,</HI> would prove neither more nor le&s;s than a direct fraud, cheat, and robbery, &s;tripping Ireland of all the commercial advantages &s;he had obtained, as well as of the con&s;titution which &s;ecured them to her, and giving nothing in return, but a right to render her&s;elf odious in this country, by an attempt at a rival&s;hip, which could not be profitable to her&s;elf, though it might be mi&s;chievous to Great Britain. He was not inclined, however, to give credit to the Mini&s;ter's rea&s;oning on this &s;ubject, and much le&s;s to the evidence he had brought to &s;upport it, the greater part of which had been merely a libel on the character and habits of the Iri&s;h nation, nor did he at the &s;ame time go with the manufacturers of this country to the <HI>extent</HI> of the evils which they apprehended&mdash;many of their arguments were un|doubtedly well founded, and the evidence they had given at the Bar merited the mo&s;t &s;erious attention: there was one point, however, in which he mo&s;t completely agreed with them,&mdash;in their a&s;&s;ertion, that if the Iri&s;h trader &s;hould be enabled to meet the Briti&s;h merchant and manufacturer <HI>in the Briti&s;h market,</HI> the gain of Ireland mu&s;t be the lo&s;s of Eng|land. This was a fact not to be controverted on any principle of common &s;en&s;e, or rea&s;onable argument. The pomp of ge|neral declamation and wa&s;te of fine words, which had on &s;o many occa&s;ions been employed to di&s;gui&s;e and perplex this plain &s;imple truth, or &s;till more fallaciou&s;ly to endeavour to prove, that Great Britain would find her balance in the Iri&s;h market, had only tended to &s;hew the weakne&s;s and incon&s;i&s;t|ency of the doctrine, they were meant to &s;upport. The truth of the argument was with the manufacturers, and this formed, in Mr. Sheridan's mind, a ground of one of the mo&s;t vehement objections he had to the pre&s;ent plan. Ireland mu&s;t not endea|vour to ri&s;e on the ruin of the trade of Great Britain&mdash;&s;he mu&s;t not aim to thrive avowedly at the expence of the Briti&s;h manufacturer, however alluring the pro&s;pect, not ju&s;tice and genero&s;ity alone, but intere&s;t and policy, would call upon her to de&s;i&s;t from the attempt. Po&s;&s;ibly at fir&s;t &s;he might find a profit and an advantage in the conte&s;t&mdash;but how was a great part of this advantage to be obtained?&mdash;by means incompatible with the true &s;pirit and principles, which led to permanent commercial pro&s;perity, by means which had been &s;tated at the bar, to form a great part of the apprehen&s;ions of tho&s;e who
<PB N="15" REF="15">
petitioned again&s;t the&s;e Propo&s;itions, by a lax execution of her revenue laws, by the corrupt countenance of her legi&s;la|ture to &s;uch a conduct, by &s;tealing her own manufactures into this country, by pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e of foreign countries for her own, by obtaining a transfer of capital, and enticing over arti&s;ts and workmen by &s;alfe hopes and ill-founded pro&s;pects, in &s;hort by &s;muggling, by evading, by defrauding, by conniving, by de|ceiving. The profit earned by &s;uch means would by the &s;y&s;tem they tend to introduce be ruinous in the end to the country which practi&s;ed them, while they would immediately deeply injure the &s;i&s;ter kingdom if &s;he &s;ubmitted to them; but that would not long continue, the con&s;equence would be, that even the name of <HI>Iri&s;hman</HI> would become odious and dete&s;table to the commercial intere&s;t of Great Britain, and Ireland would &s;oon be taught to know, that while &s;he was pre&s;&s;ing by all po&s;|&s;ible means her own advantage from this article of the &s;ettle|ment, &s;he had by other conditions of the treaty &s;urrendered into the hands of Great Britain the power of crippling and cru&s;hing the whole &s;cheme of her commerce, of cha&s;ti&s;ing her pre&s;umption, and of reducing her to her former &s;tate of ab|ject dependence, whenever the intere&s;t, the prejudices, or the animo&s;ity of the trading part of this community &s;hould counten|ance the mea&s;ure. Mr. Sheridan urged this in other points of view, and declared, that if he were a per&s;on of con&s;ideration in Ireland, &s;o far from encouraging the people there to &s;truggle for the Briti&s;h market, he &s;hould think it his duty, and what he owed to the intere&s;ts of his countrymen, to call loudly to the whole land to turn away their eyes and thoughts from that one object, to attempt no race or conte&s;t with the Briti&s;h ma|nufacturer, to &s;hun, as the greate&s;t evil, the jealou&s;ies, heart burnings, and de&s;tructive ill will, which would nece&s;&s;arily breed on &s;uch a competition, circum&s;tanced &s;o peculiarly with re&s;pect to burthens as Great Britain was, and bia&s;&s;ed by rooted habits of thinking upon this particular point, but to endea|vour to increa&s;e by fair and gentle means the home con&s;ump|tion of the produce of their own indu&s;try, and by &s;y&s;tematic and vigorous enterprize to aim at a &s;ucce&s;sful intercour&s;e with every foreign port; there, if they met the Briti&s;h merchant, it would be a liberal emulation, there, he could have no inno|vation or unfairne&s;s to complain of, and there, even if &s;ucce&s;&s;|fully rivalled, he would be con&s;cious that the encrea&s;ing wealth of Ireland, from &s;uch a &s;ource, might with truth be &s;tated to
<PB N="16" REF="16">
be a fund wherein the general commerce of England would a&s;|&s;uredly find its compen&s;ation. Thus might Ireland be addre&s;|&s;ed under her pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, but let the &s;ettlement now propo&s;ed be once e&s;tabli&s;hed, what would be the an&s;wer? Would not the Iri&s;h merchant and manufacturer reply&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"What you advi&s;e us to is unrea&s;onable and prepo&s;terous, We have bound our&s;elves for ever to the monopolies of Great Bri|tain in the Ea&s;t and in the We&s;t; we receive the commodities of both at her will, at her prices, and at her duties; we are crippled in our intercour&s;e with America, holding a preca|rious and re&s;trained trade with tho&s;e Sovereign States, as if they were &s;till Briti&s;h Colonies; our dreams of being the de|pot and emporium for the foreign countries of Europe are of con&s;equence become vi&s;ionary and ridiculous; we have violated the principles of our Con&s;titution, by giving a perpetual aid to a military force at the will of the executive Magi&s;trate; we have for ever &s;urrendered our right of external legi&s;lation into the hands of Briti&s;h Parliament: for all this the Briti&s;h mar|ket is our compen&s;ation; upon that we are compelled to fa&s;ten our minds, to that we mu&s;t cling, that we mu&s;t obtain by eve|ry po&s;&s;ible exertion of every kind, and if Great Britain &s;uffers by it, the mi&s;chief is of her own &s;eeking, and the re&s;trictions which force us to this conte&s;t of her own impo&s;ing."</Q> The&s;e would be the happy fruits of a plan, who&s;e boa&s;ted object was to cement the union of the two countries, and connect them by bonds of eternal amity and reciprocal affection!</P>
<P>After enlarging on this, Mr. Sheridan concluded with pre&s;|&s;ing to the attention of the Hou&s;e the Propo&s;itions as they then &s;tood, completely changed in &s;pirit, principle and regula|tion, and begging them to con&s;ider them in their true light, as <HI>new</HI> Propo&s;als from the Briti&s;h Parliament, tho&s;e made by the Iri&s;h Parliament being in fact rejected; and to decide whether they were &s;uch as human rea&s;on could &s;uppo&s;e the Iri&s;h Parlia|ment, weighing what they are to renounce, and what they are to acquire, could accept, if fair time was given them to argue and deliberate; or if by &s;urpri&s;e and management, they were hurried through that Parliament, at a &s;ea&s;on of thin atten|dance and relaxed attention, whether the mo&s;t fatal mi&s;under|&s;tandings might not be apprehended, from the country's after|wards di&s;covering the delu&s;ion which had been practi&s;ed upon them, and the arts and fallacies, which had obtained the irrevocable &s;urrender of their deare&s;t rights. The Re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="17" REF="17">
in debate was declared to be the e&s;&s;ence of this new &s;y&s;|tem: negative that and the plan fell to the ground; if it pa&s;&s;ed that day, a deep wound would in&s;tantly be given to the con|fidence of Ireland in Great Britain; if adopted ra&s;hly by the Iri&s;h Parliament, the deci&s;ive blow would be &s;truck, and af|fection and good faith between the two countries be bani&s;hed for ever.</P>
