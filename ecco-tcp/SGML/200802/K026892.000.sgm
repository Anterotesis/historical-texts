<HEAD>REMARKS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_TRUE Chri&s;tianity breaths no other Spirit than Peace and Love. It is the peculiar Genius of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, to furni&s;h its Di&s;ciples, not with <HI>carnal</HI> but <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Weapons: Now, to be|have becoming the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity, and to wield the Weapons of our Warfare aright, in oppo&s;ing Error, and in defending the Truths of our mo&s;t holy Religion, is com|mendable, it is Prai&s;e-worthy; this is to act the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> this to di&s;play the <HI>Divine.</HI></P>
<P>Now, as you was plea&s;ed to make a public Attack upon me; &s;urely, it behoved you thus to act. For in what ever Light you are plea&s;ed to con&s;ider me, either as a Per&s;on in an inferior Sta|tion of Life to your&s;elf; or as a private Chri&s;tian, though even held in the mo&s;t contemptible View, becau&s;e deemed by you a <HI>Methodi&s;t;</HI> yet &s;urely Sir, this will by no Means ju&s;tify, that Rudene&s;s of <HI>In&s;ult,</HI> that Rant of <HI>Defamation,</HI> that Venom of <HI>Scur|rility,</HI> with which you was plea&s;ed to treat me: And this without the lea&s;t Offence or Provocation. For on my cooly a&s;king you, Why this Treatment of me? have I ever behaved ami&s;s to you? You ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;&s;ed, I had not; and that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"you liked me very well, as from Man to Man; but that my Principles, as a <HI>Methodi&s;t,</HI> you were aver&s;e to, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>"</Q> But, Sir, is it con|&s;i&s;tent with the Character of the <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> the Politene&s;s of the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> the Dignity of the <HI>Clergyman,</HI> or the Eminence of the <HI>Doctor in Divinity,</HI> to in&s;ult, defame and abu&s;e a Per&s;on, upon a &s;uppo&s;ed, or even real Di&s;agreement in religious Principles? and even when you had nothing to charge upon a Per&s;on's Behaviour
<PB N="4" REF="3">
in &s;ocial Life? Surely &s;uch Behaviour is unju&s;tifiable, even to a <HI>Jew</HI> or a <HI>Turk!</HI></P>
<P>But if my Principles did not plea&s;e you, yet why &s;hould my Complexion offend you? Though Nature has not been &s;o liberal with the Tinge of blooming Red, to adorn my Cheeks; or, if Illne&s;s has cau&s;ed Palene&s;s there, yet why the Reflection of <HI>a Smock-faced Fellow?</HI> Who could have expected this from the Re|verend Dr. <HI>Free?</HI> As to what you was plea&s;ed to tell me you &s;hould live to do, after I am dead, the Lord (in who&s;e Hands are the I&s;&s;ues of Life and Death) only knows who may be &s;um|moned to Judgment fir&s;t; may he prepare you and me for it! But if you &s;hould vi&s;it the &s;ilent Man&s;ions of the Dead, even to <HI>kick the Dirt over my Grave,</HI> it will no more affect me when dead, than your Treatment of me when living.</P>
<P>But of this I forbear to add more, as I can't but per&s;uade my|&s;elf, that on the lea&s;t &s;erious and cool Reflection, you mu&s;t be con&s;cious of having acted much out of Character; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, though the public Attack you was plea&s;ed to make on me, was &s;o very furious, though I was really grieved at your extreme Warmth, yet it by no Means excited me to Anger again&s;t you; neither doth it di&s;po&s;e me to be very ready (to u&s;e your own Words) to <HI>run a Tilt, or to change a Word with you</HI> in this public Way.</P>
<P>But, as you was then plea&s;ed to exhibit a general Charge a|gain&s;t me, and declined entring into Particulars, referring me to a <HI>Thing</HI> you produced, (Part of which you then read, and have &s;ince publi&s;hed) entitled, <HI>Certain Articles,</HI> &amp;c. Now this Pam|phlet is intended to a&s;per&s;e tho&s;e Per&s;ons, you are plea&s;ed to call <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> as a Set of People of very dangerous Principles, per|nicious in their Nature, and de&s;tructive in their Con&s;equences, both to Church and State, and therefore unfit Members of Society. And as you publicly read part of the&s;e Articles, in order to load <HI>me</HI> with the unju&s;t Allegations therein contained, and there|by to bring <HI>me</HI> under the Cen&s;ure and Contempt of the Com|pany then pre&s;ent: Silence here I think criminal. In order therefore, to do Ju&s;tice to my Principles, as a Member of the
<PB N="5" REF="4">
e&s;tabli&s;hed Church of <HI>England,</HI> I hope I &s;hall be ju&s;tified in this Reply. Therefore, I embrace this Opportunity of publicly de|claring my Principles, and of giving a <HI>Rea&s;on of the Hope that is in me,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time of detecting and expo&s;ing the Errors you have advanced, and &s;hewing how contrary your Judgment is to the clear Determination of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the expre&s;s Declarations of holy Scripture.</P>
<P>Whether you think it <HI>decent</HI> to reply, or keep <HI>profound Silence,</HI> it weighs nothing with me. But you may be decent without be|ing dumb; write without Wrath; rea&s;on without Scurrility; and <HI>conde&s;cend to Men of low E&s;tate,</HI> without lo&s;ing any Part of your Dignity, or thinking them <HI>beneath your Notice.</HI> But ju&s;t as you plea&s;e, Doctor: Reply or forbear, I am content. I approve your Example of Brevity. You &s;ay, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"all <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>good</HI> People, would choo&s;e to manage a religious Di&s;pute in this Manner."</Q> But, Sir, &s;uffer me to ob&s;erve, had your few Pages abounded with le&s;s of the Wrath of Men, and more of the Mildne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian, and if Chri&s;tian Moderation and Charity had been &s;ub&s;tituted in the Room of that Ferocity of Spirit, and Unchari|tablene&s;s of Cen&s;ure: Had you con&s;ulted this whole&s;ome Advice,<Q><L>" Be calm in arguing, for Fiercene&s;s makes</L>
<L>" Error a Fault, and Truth Di&s;courte&s;y,</L></Q> &s;ure I am, your Performance had met with le&s;s Cen&s;ure, and more Approbation; and the Author would have had a ju&s;ter Claim to the Epithets of <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>But let us attend to this Treati&s;e; or the&s;e Directions to a Wor&s;hipful Court; or this Libel again&s;t a Clergyman, or&mdash;what &s;hall I call it? Why, Page the 1&s;t begins the Preamble of, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Certain Articles propos'd to the &s;erious Con&s;ideration of the <HI>Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants</HI> of the Wor&s;hipful Company of the <HI>Salters,</HI> rela|tive to the Application of a <HI>Methodi&s;t</HI> for their Votes and Inte|re&s;t, in order to his being promoted to the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI>'s Lecture|&s;hip at <HI>St. Dun&s;tans in the Ea&s;t,</HI> at pre&s;ent in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Reverend Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n,</HI> he being &s;till alive, and, by God's Favour, likely to continue to live."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
To be &s;ure, it begins pretty enough. But then, won't the worthy Gentlemen of of this Wor&s;hipful Court, think you take too much upon you? Is it not rather too <HI>Free,</HI> thus publicly to direct or influence them in their Choice, as though they would be remi&s;s in enquiring into, or were not capable to judge of the Merit of the Candidates them&s;elves? What can you &s;ay to this, Sir? Why, you tell them, that you are <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>a Per&s;on</HI> concerned both for their <HI>Honour,</HI> and the <HI>public Good.</HI>"</Q> Va&s;tly kind in|deed! How u&s;eful are your public-&s;pirited Gentlemen to Society! For upon Suppo&s;ition, that the&s;e worthy Gentlemen of this Court, are not duly concerned for <HI>their own Honour,</HI> and the <HI>public Good,</HI> then your Hints and Directions are well timed.</P>
<P>For, you ob&s;erve, Page 12. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>There are, in all Places, &s;ome By|&s;tanders, to ob&s;erve whether &s;uch Duties be</HI> rightly <HI>performed, or not.</HI>"</Q> So, Sir, you, as one of the&s;e <HI>By-&s;tanders,</HI> are ju&s;t looking on, and as you &s;ee Need, are giving all ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Hints and Di|rections to this Wor&s;hipful Court. Well, &s;ince this is the Ca&s;e, what di&s;tingui&s;hed Honours, and what noble Emoluments are to be your Reward, for all your di&s;intere&s;ted Pains and Labour; who is able to &s;ay?</P>
<P>The Freedom of a Company, in a Gold Box, is no incon&s;ide|rable Pre&s;ent, be&s;ides enjoying the much greater Honour of being <HI>Free</HI> of a Company, than making <HI>Free</HI> with the Wor&s;hipful Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants, or&mdash;in Ca&s;e of a Vacancy of this Lecture&s;hip, &s;uppo&s;e, Dr. <HI>Free,</HI> as a Reward for his <HI>Certain Articles,</HI> &amp;c. was to be promoted to it. Sir, what &s;ay you to this? would not this &s;ilence <HI>the Accu&s;ations or Murmurings of the BY-STANDERS, Free</HI> the Gentlemen's <HI>Characters, both from the Cen&s;ure, as well as the Complaints of the PEOPLE,</HI> which you repre&s;ent the Danger of? Page 13. You can have no Objection to this little Dona|tion; it is pretty evident you can't: As it is well known, you &s;tand a Candidate, and are making Intere&s;t for this Lecture|&s;hip.</P>
<P>Now, Doctor, here we have a <HI>Key</HI> to the Whole. Hence 'tis obvious, that all that Preten&s;ion of your being <HI>concerned</HI> for the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Gentlemens <HI>Honour,</HI> and the <HI>Publick Good,</HI> alas Sir! it dwindles into little, low, mean and &s;ordid Motives, tending to &s;ini&s;ter Ends and &s;elfi&s;h Views: For as Dr. <HI>Free</HI> appears to be a Candidate, he therefore looks on this avowed <HI>Methodi&s;t</HI> (as he deems him) as his Rival or Competitor, &s;tanding in the Way of his Intere&s;t. Now, Sir, &s;ince this is the true State of the Ca&s;e, in what Light, think you, will all that Defamation, Obloquy and Reproach with which you have been plea&s;ed to treat this Reverend and worthy Clergyman appear?</P>
<P>Sir, the Di&s;cerning and Judicious will have an Eye to this. They will candidly weigh this Affair. They will take Know|ledge of the Bitterne&s;s of your Spirit, the extreme Virulence of your Language, and the Unchri&s;tian Treatment of the Gen|tleman you thus write again&s;t; and in the Determination of cool Rea&s;on and &s;olid Judgment, you will be cen&s;ured as having ex|ceeded all Bounds of Moderation, Charity and Benevolence; and all this in &s;ub&s;ervient Views to your own Self-Intere&s;t; and in the End, you will be found to have over&s;hot the Mark, and to have counteracted your own <HI>crafty Arts and Schemes.</HI></P>
<P>Here then we &s;ee the Motives and De&s;igns of the&s;e <HI>certain Ar|ticles.</HI> The &s;hort View of the Hi&s;tory of this doughty Performance &s;tands thus.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Here is a <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Lecture&s;hip in the Gift of the Wor|&s;hipful Company of <HI>Salters,</HI> which Dr. <HI>Free</HI> thinks worth his ap|plying for, therefore,</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> Offers him&s;elf as a Candidate, and makes Intere&s;t for the &s;ame, but</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> On Application finds the Rev. Mr. &mdash; has the Favour of &s;ome of the worthy Gentlemen of the Court of A&s;&s;i&s;tants, on which he tells them Mr. &mdash; is a <HI>Methodi&s;t.</HI> But, not think|ing this &s;ufficient to prejudice the Minds of the&s;e Gentlemen a|gain&s;t Mr. &mdash;; Therefore,</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
4<HI>thly,</HI> In an extreme ill Humour, you &s;et about draw|ing up certain Articles, which you pre&s;ent to the Gentlemen, in order to a&s;per&s;e, blacken, and vilify this oppo&s;ing Candidate. How far you have &s;ucceeded herein, the&s;e few Sentences &s;et forth; you a&s;&s;ert, <Q REND="inline">"he acts in open and &s;candalous Oppo&s;ition to the Church of <HI>England</HI>&mdash;with Bla&s;phemy and Impiety,&mdash;Diabolical Phrenzy&mdash;gives our Saviour the Lie&mdash;an Enemy to all good Works&mdash;decries Virtue and Morality&mdash;acting like a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> or Infidel, or the Devil him&s;elf&mdash;Relea&s;ing Men from their natural Fears of a Deity&mdash;Making Room for all Manner of Vice and Villainy&mdash;Not only guilty of Athei&s;m, but Trea&s;on al&s;o again&s;t the State and Government, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI>"</Q> and after all this who would wonder to find that Hint (as a Spe|cimen of your Moderation and Charity) for di&s;patching a Per&s;on &s;o obnoxious in your Eyes, as being not fit to live; for you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline"><HI>Athei&s;ts in &s;ome Countries have been put to Death, as Per&s;ons very dan|gerous to a State.</HI>"</Q> And,</P>
<P>5<HI>thly,</HI> All thro' the&s;e Articles, you admoni&s;h the Gentlemen, <Q REND="inline">"that they can't, as Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> be con|cerned in promoting &s;uch a Per&s;on&mdash;nor as good Subjects to the State, for Fear of the Magi&s;trates Cen&s;ure of their Characters,"&mdash;"incurring the Cen&s;ure of the Bi&s;hop;"</Q> and Page 15 you &s;uppo&s;e the Gentlemen to be governed by <HI>private Intere&s;t,</HI> and influenced by avaritious Views in <HI>Dealing</HI> (not very delicate, not very genteel, this I think, Doctor) you tell them, <Q REND="inline">"if they fall under the Bi&s;hops Cen&s;ure, the be&s;t Excu&s;e they can make"</Q> (too much &s;uppo&s;ed, and too much implied indeed, Sir) is, <Q REND="inline"><HI>that they had</HI> UNWARILY <HI>promi&s;ed an Acquaintance with whom they had &s;ome</HI> DEALINGS or PRIVATE INTEREST, <HI>that they would, at All</HI> ADVENTURES <HI>be &s;erviceable to &s;uch a Per&s;on.</HI>"&mdash;</Q>What all this to Gentlemen of com|mon Prudence, Doctor? Then you &s;hew the Gentlemen a pretty Knack of departing from a PRECIPITATE PROMISE (what at them again, Sir!) after having introduced a Quotation from a Letter of the late Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> wi&s;h the Pre&s;ervation of the Life of Mr. <HI>B&mdash;n,</HI> and the Di&s;appointment of the Arts and Schemes of this crafty <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI> you take your Leave of the Gentlemen, and &s;o&mdash;are their humble Servant. And</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>La&s;tly,</HI> While this peccant Humour was operating, and being <HI>ready to run a-tilt,</HI> (as you &s;ay) I chanced to fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n your Way, and &s;o you vented &s;ome of your Anger and Re&s;entment up|on <HI>me</HI> as a <HI>Methodi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Here ends the Hi&s;tory of Dr. <HI>Free</HI>'s certain Articles and Po&s;t|cript. Thus much for the <HI>Morality</HI> of them. Next, let us attend to the Divinity they contain.</P>
<P>But I would premi&s;e, that after all, I am really at a Lo&s;s to know what you mean by a <HI>Methodi&s;t.</HI> The Appellation is a very &s;im|ple, inoffen&s;ive one: I &s;ee no more Harm in it, than in being cal|led a <HI>Trade&s;man,</HI> a <HI>Mechanick,</HI> or <HI>Doctor in Divinity;</HI> though you are plea&s;ed to u&s;e it as a Term of Reproach, in order to convey &s;ome very bad Idea of the Per&s;ons, you are plea&s;ed to apply it to. I told you my Profe&s;&s;ion, that I am a Member of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed Church of <HI>England;</HI> con&s;equently, that I attend upon her Wor&s;hip, approve her Doctrines, and live in Communion with her. I am of no other Sect or Party.</P>
<P>Now, am I a <HI>Methodi&s;t</HI> for this? "No." What then? <Q REND="inline">"Why, you hear particular Men, &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Romaine, Jones,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> I do; I do hear, and rejoice con&s;tantly to hear them, and all &s;uch Mi|ni&s;ters, who faithfully and con&s;cientiou&s;ly preach the Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Doth this con&s;titute me a <HI>Methodi&s;t?</HI> "Yes." Why, then I'll be a <HI>Methodi&s;t,</HI> one of your <HI>Church of Eng|land Methodi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>But, are not the&s;e Gentlemen Mini&s;ters of our Church? Are they not regularly ordained, and do they not act regularly? <Q REND="inline">"Yes, but they are <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> for all that." "How &s;o?" "Why, they preach different Doctrines from the re&s;t of the Clergy."</Q> This may be Truth, and yet no Fault in them; for no &s;ooner doth a Mini&s;ter preach the antient, Scripture Doctrines of our Church, but he is deemd'd a <HI>Methodi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
I wi&s;h, Doctor, you had obliged the World with your De&s;crip|tion of a <HI>Methodi&s;t;</HI> but, as you have not, I will here lay before you and the World, the be&s;t De&s;cription I am able.</P>
<P>He is one whom GOD hath cho&s;en in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> out of Mankind, to deliver from Cur&s;e and Damnation, and to bring, by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to everla&s;ting Salvation; he is called, according to GOD's Purpo&s;e, by his Spirit working in due Sea&s;on; he, through Grace, obeys the Calling; he is ju&s;tified <HI>Freely;</HI> he is made the Son of GOD by Adoption; he <HI>Feels</HI> in him&s;elf the Workings of the Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> mortifying the Works of the Fle&s;h, and his earthly Mem|bers, and drawing up his Mind to high and heavenly Things; he is made like the Image of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> walks religiou&s;ly in <HI>Good Works,</HI> and at length, by GOD's Mercy, (not for Works of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s he hath done, but according to GOD's Mercy) he is &s;aved, and attains to everla&s;ting Felicity.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, have you any Di&s;like to this View of <HI>Methodi&s;m?</HI> I think you cannot. As I greatly approve the Language of our Church, I have borrow'd the&s;e Words from the 17th Article. May the LORD GOD of Grace and Love make you and I &s;uch Kind of <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> I pray! To &s;pread &s;uch Kind of <HI>Methodi&s;m,</HI> as is here de&s;cribed, and to bring Mankind into this happy, this holy State, is the chief End and De&s;ign of the&s;e truly Reverend and Worthy Clergymen of our Church, who pa&s;s under this Denomination. With many of them, I have the Honour to be pret|ty conver&s;ant, and, as it is my great Happine&s;s to hear the Doc|trines which they publickly deliver, I can, and do venture to affirm, that to promote and propagate true <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> that Men might be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> not in Name only, but al&s;o in true Faith and holy Practice to be their View: To this great and good End they labour, and are indefatigable, and for the Sake of this, they go thro' <HI>evil Report and good Report;</HI> for <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Sake, and the Good of precious Souls, they are content to be accounted <HI>Madmen</HI> and <HI>Fools;</HI> they are <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed, reviled, defamed,</HI> yea, they are treated <HI>as the Filth of the World, and the Offscouring of all Things;</HI> and under all this, they think them&s;elves happy, in being in&s;trumental of be|getting in the Hearts of Sinners Repentance towards GOD, and Faith in our Lord <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> that from a Principle of Love to GOD
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and Man, they might be holy in all Manner of Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s, and zealous of good Works here, and that from being Members of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Church militant on Earth, they might be admitted to the Church triumphant in Glory.</P>
<P>And in order to this, the Doctrines they preach, are &s;uch as are agreeable to GOD's holy Word, and that plain, tho'&s;hort Sy&s;tem of Divinity, laid down in the Articles of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But, you object, Page 5. That, <Q REND="inline">"it is notorious, that the <HI>Me|thodi&s;ts,</HI> under the Ma&s;k of being <HI>true Sons</HI> of the Church, do ever explain the Word <HI>Faith,</HI> as it &s;tands in &s;ome of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Wri|tings, in a Manner &s;o different from the clear Declaration of St. <HI>James,</HI> as to make the Doctrine of one Apo&s;tle a direct and flat Contradiction to the other."</Q></P>
<P>Sir, I affirm this Charge, from Beginning to End, to be noto|riou&s;ly fal&s;e. One Circum&s;tance is wanting there, the Proof, the Proof, Doctor. Where is that Proof to &s;upport the&s;e A&s;&s;er|tions? Which of the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> do this? Why did you not name &s;ome one or more of them? Why have you not produced &s;ome Quotation from &s;ome of their Writings (as many of them have publi&s;hed what they preach) to prove your A&s;&s;ertion? The plain Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e you could not. And</P>
<P>Therefore, in the Judgment of Truth, you would have been equally ju&s;tifiable in &s;aying, that the <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI> put both the Apo&s;tles St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>James</HI> to Death. So far from making the Doctrine of one Apo&s;tle a flat Contradiction to the other, the Doctrines they advance have a direct Tendency to reconcile and explain them: For they allow, and make U&s;e of that ju&s;t and well known Di&s;tinction, approved of by all &s;ound, Prote&s;tant Divines, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of Ju&s;tification before GOD, St. <HI>James</HI> of Ju&s;tification before Men; St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of the Ju&s;tifi|cation of our Per&s;ons, through Faith in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Saviour of Sin|ners; St. <HI>James</HI> of the Ju&s;tification of our Faith in the Sight of Men, by its bringing forth good Works as the certain Evidence and Effects of its being a <HI>lively</HI> Faith. Neither do they preach as
<PB N="12" REF="11">

<P>But, not to do as you have, a&s;&s;ert without Evidence; of the Many that might be brought to invalidate your A&s;&s;ertion, I will produce a &s;ew Sentences from my honoured and much e&s;teemed Friends, the Rev.

And why are we created a-new in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us?</HI> that we may live &s;till to the Fle&s;h and its corrupt Appetites? No: for then we &s;hould be created a-new in the Devil, and not in, <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> but we are created a-new unto good Works.&mdash;GOD gives us Righteou&s;ne&s;s from Heaven, that it may rai&s;e us up to Heaven.&mdash;It will not remain in us as a dead and barren Principle, but will make us fruitful in good Works, even that we may be filled with the Fruits of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, which are by <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> unto the Glory and Prai&s;e of God the Father."</Q> <HI>Vide</HI> Mr. <HI>Romaine</HI>'s Sermon, lately preached before the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> on <HI>The Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Jones</HI> on this very Subject, namely, reconciling St. <HI>Paul</HI> and St. <HI>James</HI> in his Expo&s;ition of the Church Catechi&s;m, we have the&s;e Words. <Q REND="inline">"When we preach up Ju&s;tification by Faith, we mean not a dead, lifele&s;s Faith (the Faith of Devils) but &s;uch a Faith as is <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> witne&s;&s;ed to Souls by his Spirit, and leading them into Holine&s;s of Heart and Life."</Q> And again, <Q REND="inline">"By Faith is meant a certain Principle implanted in the Soul, which will not fail to produce Piety, and Holine&s;s of Heart and Life."</Q> And once more, <Q REND="inline">"We are ju&s;tified only by Faith in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> This Faith, however, is a vital Principle of Holine&s;s within us, and they who really have it, are never de&s;titute of good Fruits.

<P>Hence all that you have &s;aid on this Head, amounts to no more than mere Rant and Declamation, and all the Con&s;equences which
<PB N="13" REF="12">
you have attempted to draw, do not at all affect the Per&s;ons again&s;t whom you de&s;ign them; for this very plain Rea&s;on, becau&s;e the Premi&s;es laid down are fal&s;e, and the farther you advance, the more you lo&s;e Sight of the Truth: Therefore, I need &s;ay no more upon this Head. Tho&s;e who hear the&s;e Mini&s;ters preach, know the Contrary of what you have charged upon them; and tho&s;e who do not (unle&s;s utterly blinded by Prejudice) may have ful|ler Satisfaction of the Unju&s;tne&s;s of your Charge, from the many Tracts, Sermons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which have been publi&s;hed by the&s;e Re|verend Mini&s;ters of your Church, who are called <HI>Methodi&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, before I quit this Part, permit me to remind you, that the Evidence you &s;hould have given to this <HI>wor&s;hipful Court,</HI> (though even again&s;t <HI>Methodi&s;ts</HI>) ought to have been the <HI>Truth,</HI> the <HI>whole Truth,</HI> and <HI>nothing but the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>I do not believe any one of the Reverend Body of the Clergy, (be&s;ide your&s;elf) how much &s;oever they may di&s;approve of what is called <HI>Methodi&s;m,</HI> would have wrote either again&s;t the worthy and pious Clergyman, you in particular oppo&s;e; or the Body of tho&s;e Clergymen, who are deemed <HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> in &s;o unkind, uncharita|ble, and unchri&s;tian Spirit: I am per&s;uaded, that a Regard to Truth, Mode&s;ty, and Decency, would have influenced their Pens to more Mildne&s;s and Humanity. And yet you talk very highly of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Morality,</HI> and &s;ay it is a Rule in Religion to do as we would be done by.&mdash;Here that Que&s;tion from St. <HI>James,</HI> is very pertinent, <HI>Shew me your Faith by your Works.</HI> Is not Gentlene&s;s, Meekne&s;s, Kindne&s;s, brotherly Charity in your Sy&s;tem of Morality? but who&s;e Image and Super&s;cription doth your Per|formance bear?

<P>In the next Ob&s;ervation, here is a mo&s;t egregious Blunder; you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"the Word <HI>alone,</HI> excludes only the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Ceremonies."</Q> Now it happens a little unlucky for you, Doctor; the Word <HI>alone</HI> is not once u&s;ed upon this Subject, in neither of the Epi&s;tles to the <HI>Romans,</HI> or <HI>Galatians.</HI> How is this, Sir?

See <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 31. <HI>Do we then make void the Law, thro' Faith?

<P>Page 7 and 8, you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"we mu&s;t contend that there is Comparative Merit; Compari&s;on being made between Man and Man.

It is bla&s;phemous to &s;ay, that GOD makes no Di&s;tinction between Virtue and Vice, or that he does not love Virtue, and hate Vice. But if he love Virtue, there mu&s;t be &s;omething in Virtue naturally amiable; and that is Merit; not ab&s;olute Merit indeed, but human Merit, Me|rit in one Man above another; otherwi&s;e the Wicked would have as good a Title to Salvation, as the Good."</Q></P>
<P>Should we not expect, as a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Divine, you would have u&s;ed Scripture Language, and &s;criptural Di&s;tinctions? but this you have not done. Be it known unto you, that we Prote&s;tant
<PB N="15" REF="14">
Church of <HI>England Methodi&s;ts,</HI> object to all Kind of <HI>Merit of Man, Merit of Works,</HI> all <HI>human Merit.</HI> We have the Authority of Scripture; we have the Determination of our Church to &s;up|port us herein. We have heard, indeed, of a Champion for the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>good Works</HI> are, <HI>Mercatura Regni Coe|le&s;tis,</HI> the Price we pay for the Kingdom of Heaven. And ano|ther Zealot of that Communion declares, <HI>Coelum Gratis non Acci|piam,</HI> it &s;hall never be &s;aid that I receive Heaven as a Matter of Alms. And tho' you are plea&s;ed to appear as the Triumvirate, and to contend for <HI>comparative Merit,</HI> and <HI>human Merit,</HI> and the <HI>Me|rits of Virtue and Morality,</HI> and I know not what un&s;criptural Jar|gon; yet we, Prote&s;tants, know of no <HI>Merit</HI> to give us a Title to the Kingdom of Heaven, but the Merits of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> alone. Our Church teaches us not to pre&s;ume to approach the Table of the Lord, tru&s;ting in our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; nor to addre&s;s the Throne of Grace, but thro' the Merits and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> only; for thus &s;he concludes all her Prayers. If <HI>you</HI> are <HI>given to change,</HI> we are not. We know the Voice of our Church. We approve her Doctrines. And we will abide by them; let others do as they plea&s;e. We are for none of your arrant Popery, none of the Here&s;ies of that Church, though under the Veil of Prote&s;tanti&s;m.</P>
<P>We own and believe the Mi&s;ery and Depravity of Man's State by the Fall; <Q REND="inline">"that every Man is far gone from original Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is of his own Nature inclined to Evil, and that therefore, thro' original Sin, every Per&s;on born into this World, de&s;erveth God's Wrath and Damnation;"</Q> as our Church teaches us in the ninth Article. And we are taught likewi&s;e, that it is by the free Grace and unmerited Love of God only, that Sinners are deliver'd from &s;uch a lo&s;t and helple&s;s State, as declared in the tenth Article; <Q REND="inline">"for the Condition o&s; Man, after the Fall, is &s;uch, that (&s;o far from meriting any Thing at the Hands of God) he is unable to turn and prepare him&s;elf by his own natural Strength and good Works, to Faith and calling upon God, without the Grace of God, by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> &amp;c."</Q> And &s;o far are we from tru&s;ting to, relying upon, or boa&s;ting of our own Works, or comparative, or human Merit, to procure us a Title to the Kingdom of Hea|ven, which you talk of; that we firmly hold and believe with our eleventh Article, that, <Q REND="inline">"we are accounted righteous before God,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
ONLY for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> by Faith; not for our own Works or De&s;ervings"</Q> (as you tell us); but we are ju&s;tified by Faith <HI>only;</HI> and our Church farther calls this <Q REND="inline">"a <HI>mo&s;t whole&s;ome</HI> Doctrine, and very full of <HI>Godly</HI> Comfort,"</Q> tho' you are plea&s;ed to deny and explode this. We believe, and are firmly per&s;uaded by the Word of God, as well as the Declaration of our Church, Article 12. That <Q REND="inline">"good Works are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after (not go before in order to procure our Ju&s;tification, or Title to Glory) they follow after our Ju&s;tification, yet they cannot put away our Sins, nor endure the Severity of God's Wrath;"</Q> how then, can you, in any Sen&s;e, &s;ay, they give us a Ti|tle to Glory? for ob&s;erve our Church here &s;peaks of the Works of the Saints, real <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> true Believers, &s;uch Works as &s;pring from Faith, done from a right Principle, and to a right End, and yet the&s;e Works our Article declares, <Q REND="inline">"can't put away our Sins, nor endure the Severity of God's Wrath, yet are they plea&s;ing and acceptable to God."</Q> How? thro' their own natural Amiablene&s;s, as you &s;ay? No. Acceptable to God in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> thro' whom our Per&s;ons are ju&s;tified, pardoned, and accepted, and, thro' who&s;e Merits alone, we obtain a Title to eternal Glory, and our Works are al&s;o accepted <HI>in him,</HI> as <Q REND="inline">"&s;pringing nece&s;&s;a|rily out of a true and lively Faith:"</Q></P>
<P>This is what we contend for, not a dead Faith that produceth nothing, as you unju&s;tly charge again&s;t us; we know, without much <HI>Logic,</HI> that a dead Faith, which pro|duceth nothing, cannot produce Salvation. But it is a <HI>lively Faith,</HI> which may be as evidently known, as a Tree di&s;cerned by its Fruit. And we do allow that good Works, Works of Faith in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> Labours of Love to our God and Saviour, &s;hall by no means lo&s;e their Reward, even a Reward of Grace, not of Debt; a Reward of Mercy, not of Merit. Therefore we wi&s;h and pray for the Increa&s;e of Holine&s;s, and the Practice of good Works. We are grieved to &s;ee Iniquity abound. We de&s;ire that the Love of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to Sinners was more preached and in&s;i&s;ted on than it is: For we know, were the Hearts of Men more affected with the Love, the unexampled Love of our only Lord and Sa|viour, <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in laying down his Life to atone for their Sins, and in purcha&s;ing for them a Title to eternal Glory; this Love would con&s;train them to hate &s;in, and love and obey him who &s;o
<PB N="17" REF="16">
loved them. Humility, Repentance, Faith, Holine&s;s, good Works, and all the Graces of the Go&s;pel would be more ex|perienced among Men; whereas filling Mens Heads with un|&s;criptural Notions of their <HI>comparative Merit,</HI> their <HI>human Merit,</HI> and <HI>Merit of one Man above another,</HI> only tends to counteract the Go&s;pel, by leading Men, contrary to our Saviour's Doctrine, to <HI>tru&s;t in them&s;elves that they are righteous, and to de&s;pi&s;e others;</HI> to exalt in&s;tead of humbling them, and keeps them from Repen|tance, fills them with Phari&s;aical Pride, and gives them the Language of <HI>Come not near me, for I am holier than thou,</HI> I&s;a. lxv. 5. which is offen&s;ive to God; in&s;tead of that humble and ac|ceptable Cry, <HI>God be merciful to me, a Sinner!</HI> And thro' Pride it keeps them in a high Conceit of their own Works and De|&s;ervings, &s;o as to &s;light and entertain very &s;uperficial Thoughts of the Love and Merits of our only Saviour, &s;o as not to be|lieve on him for <HI>Ju&s;tification unto Life.</HI></P>
<P>And before a Per&s;on attains to this State, our Church declares, in Article XIII. <HI>of Works done before Ju&s;tification.</HI> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ALL WORKS done before the Grace of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and the In&s;piration of God's Holy Spirit, are not plea&s;ant to God; for as much as they &s;pring not of Faith in <HI>Je&s;u Chri&s;t;</HI> neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, or (as the School-Authors &s;ay) de&s;erve Grace of Congruity; for they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done; we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin."</Q></P>
<P>But you a&s;&s;ert, <Q REND="inline">"&s;ome Men are better than others:"</Q> Do you mean by Nature? if &s;o; you contradict the whole Tenor of God's Word; which declares <HI>all are Sinners, there is no Difference; for all have &s;inned, and come &s;hort of the Glory of God:</HI> But you &s;ay, <Q REND="inline">"there is a Difference in the Behaviour of Men;"</Q> 'tis granted; but our Church declares, that neither the Behaviour of Men, their Virtue or Morality, or any Works they can do, can merit or de&s;erve Grace, procure Ju&s;tification, or purcha&s;e a <HI>Title to Glory.</HI> But what makes a Difference in Men? Grace, not Merit; <HI>by the Grace of God I am what I am,</HI> is the Language of every humble <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> as well as of a holy Apo&s;tle; for thus argues the Apo&s;tle: <HI>Who maketh thee to differ</HI> [or di&s;tingui&s;heth thee] <HI>from another? And what ha&s;t thou, that thou did&s;t not receive? Now if thou did&s;t receive</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HI>it, why do&s;t thou glory as if thou did&s;t not receive it?</HI> 1 Cor. iv. 7. And again, the &s;ame Apo&s;tle declares, <HI>by Grace ye are &s;aved through Faith; and that</HI> [Faith] <HI>not of your&s;elves, it is the Gift of God, not of Works, left any Man &s;hould boa&s;t; for God will have no Fle&s;h to glory in his Pre&s;ence;</HI> [not upon any &s;up|po&s;ed Merit in him&s;elf] <HI>but he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." Where is boa&s;ting then? It is excluded; by what Law? of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</HI> If Sal|vation be by Grace, then argues the Apo&s;tle, <HI>it is no more of Works; otherwi&s;e, Grace is no more Grace: But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace; otherwi&s;e, Work is no more Work:</HI> Therefore we conclude, a Man is ju&s;tified [his Sins pardon'd, his Per&s;on accepted to God's Love and Favour, and his Title to Glory is evidenced to him] <HI>by Faith,</HI> without the Deeds of the Law, either <HI>natural, ceremonial,</HI> or <HI>moral,</HI> &s;aith the much-admired <HI>Burket,</HI> in his Expo&s;ition on this Chapter; &s;o that, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> declares, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 6. <HI>When we were without Strength, in due Time Chri&s;t died for the Ungodly:</HI> And not as being holy, ju&s;t, and righteous Per&s;ons are we ju&s;tified by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> but as Sinners, as <HI>the Ungodly;</HI> as the &s;ame Apo&s;tle declares, <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 5. by being united to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> by Faith, we are, as our Church expre&s;&s;es it, (Communion Service) <HI>one with Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t with us; we dwell in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;t in us.</HI> Hence we partake of the Influences of that Holy Spirit, who&s;e gracious Office it is to <HI>&s;anctify the Un|holy.</HI> So <HI>Milton,</HI><Q><L>&mdash;His Merit</L>
<L>Imputed &s;hall ab&s;olve them who renounce</L>
<L>Their own, both righteous and unrighteous Deeds;</L>
<L>And live in HIM tran&s;planted, and from HIM</L>
<L>Receive new Life.</L></Q></P>
<P>And the venerable Reformers of our Church, in the Ho|mily of Salvation, declare, <Q REND="inline">"That this Saying, that we be ju&s;tified by Faith only, freely, and without Works, is &s;poken to take away clearly <HI>all</HI> Merit of our Works;&mdash;and there|fore, wholly to a&s;cribe the Merit and De&s;erving of our Ju&s;ti|fication unto <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> ONLY, and his mo&s;t precious Blood-&s;hed|ding.
