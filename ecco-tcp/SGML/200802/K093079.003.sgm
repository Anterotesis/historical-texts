Suffice it only to ob&s;erve, that the following facts may be proved to demon&s;tration: The Letters, which have been always e&s;teemed as the principal proof of Queen Mary's guilt, are forged: Buchanan, on who&s;e authority Thuanus and other hi&s;torians have condemned her, has fal|&s;ified &s;everal circum&s;tances of her hi&s;tory, and has cited again&s;t her public records which never exi&s;ted: And, to add no more; The treatment &s;he received from her illu&s;trious Cou&s;in was dictated by a policy truly Machia|velian, which trampled on the obligations of Honour, of Humanity, and Morality. From whence it may be inferred, That, to expre&s;s the indignation at the cruel treatment of Mary which Hi&s;tory mu&s;t ever in&s;pire, and to drop a tear on her &s;ufferings, is not unworthy of a writer who would appear in the cau&s;e of Virtue.</NOTE>.</L>
