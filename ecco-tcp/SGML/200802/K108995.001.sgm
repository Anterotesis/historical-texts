<P>IN addition to the &s;ource of materials whence I derive this work, which were before large, complicate, and redundant; I have been, and no doubt &s;hall continue to be, favoured with much anonymous and other advice, manife&s;tly the re&s;ult of either curio&s;ity, or malignity, or el&s;e kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>As I mean to do my duty faithfully, firmly, and hone&s;tly; I do not, of cour&s;e, &s;et out with an expectation of plea&s;ing every body, a ta&s;k which would reflect no great reputation on him who &s;hould accompli&s;h it. As I hold my&s;elf, however, re&s;pon&s;ible for the validity of tho&s;e motives which may induce me to broach my opi|nions; I &s;hall, after I have gone through the whole body of evidence, &s;um up, in the nature of a charge to a jury, all tho&s;e collateral points which may have go|verned my conduct throughout the whole of this un|dertaking.</P>
<P>To an addre&s;s of this kind which I &s;hall place at the head of this hi&s;tory, by way of preface, I refer all tho&s;e who have appeared, in any re&s;pect, to be &s;olicitous about me or my work, taking, till then, a privilege to my&s;elf to po&s;tpone any public notice of their favours.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4">This, declaration, however, has nothing to do with the warm and zealous exertions of tho&s;e who&s;e kind|ne&s;s and attention have &s;o largely &s;welled my &s;ub&s;crip|tion.

<HEAD>CHAP. I. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THREE que&s;tions &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves on a con&s;i|deration of this undertaking:</P>
<P>Whether the &s;ubject it treats be of &s;ufficient moment, the characters it celebrates of &s;ufficient im|portance, and the events it relates of &s;ufficient authenticity to intere&s;t the public. To which may be added, by way of a fourth propo&s;ition&mdash;Whether, even &s;hould the&s;e points be incontrovertably made out, it can create intere&s;t to &s;uch a degree as e&s;|&s;entially to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of truth and morality.</P>
<P>Of this field for enquiry, over which I mean to
<PB N="2" REF="6">
go at large in my preface, I &s;hall, at pre&s;ent content my&s;elf with taking a cur&s;ory review.</P>
<P>If of all the arts of imitation the mo&s;t &s;educing, the mo&s;t ingenious, the mo&s;t expanded, and the mo&s;t e&s;teemed, that depicts nature by pre&s;enting man to man, and face to face; that teaches us to be friends, brothers, hu&s;bands, and fathers; that ac|celerates the progre&s;s of our ideas, perfects our rea|&s;on and our &s;en&s;ibility, and induces us to blu&s;h at vice, and cheri&s;h virtue. If the &s;tage exhibits this art, then is it of &s;ufficient moment to intere&s;t the public.</P>
<P>The &s;tage, to which denomination I &s;hall beg to reduce all &s;ecular &s;pectacles intended to inculcate morality, has maintained a commanding &s;ituation at all times, and in all countries. Of this religion has furni&s;hed us with many examples, mythology with more. Indeed, as mythology is no other than al|legorical religion, &s;o are the doctrines promulgated from the &s;tage allegorical morality; to which prie&s;ts have ever and wi&s;ely lent their countenance and protection. Altars have been more thronged through the winning medium of poetry, mu&s;ic, and dancing, than through the attraction of religious or moral duty. Out of fiction &s;prings truth. It is in human nature to love entreaties rather than commands, and
<PB N="3" REF="7">
that argument is the &s;ure&s;t to prevail that awakens our plea&s;ure while it conciliates our intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t delightful fountain is the &s;ame by night as by day. Its waters are as pure, as clear, and as delicious; but, though nece&s;&s;ity may, induce us to have recour&s;e to it in the night, it is in the day alone that the draft is &s;weetened, through the medium of contemplation, by an idea of that heaven which is &s;o beautifully reflects. So did man wander in a chaos of truth till the light of &s;cience taught him how to di&s;tingui&s;h its beauty.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd propo&s;ition I &s;hall an&s;wer, that if poets, warriours, philo&s;ophers, and legi&s;lators, if tho&s;e who have united in them&s;elves tho&s;e various cha|racters, if all the promoters and protectors of the imitative arts, who&s;e exertions have &s;o nobly con|tributed to civilize the world, together with tho&s;e men &s;o peculiarly gifted by nature, as to command the pa&s;&s;ions of their auditors, to compel bur&s;ts of laughter, force torrents of tears, and &s;o to transfu&s;e the workings of their own &s;en&s;ibility into their hearers as to rai&s;e pity, excite terror, and in&s;pire delight. If the &s;tage exhibits the&s;e characters, then is it of &s;ufficient importance to intere&s;t the public.</P>
<P>Tis little to &s;ay that the greate&s;t men, both as to
<PB N="4" REF="8">
power and talents, that ever lived, have countenanced the &s;tage. The greate&s;t men, in different coun|tries, and in different times, have been not only au|thors and actors, but even dancers. Tho&s;e great writers, AESCHYLUS and SOPHOCLES, were &s;tate&s;|men and warriours. They wrote for their country, and combated for it; and the &s;ame hand that, to &s;erve the cau&s;e of morality, held the pen; in the cau&s;e of GREECE, held the &s;word. <HI>The Seven Chiefs, before Thebes</HI> of AESCHYLUS, was &s;aid to in&s;pire his audi|tors with all the fury of battle, and they compli|mented him with &s;aying, that though AESCHYLUS wrote the piece, it was dictated by MARS.</P>
<P>This work will adduce a multitude of proofs to make out the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions. In the mean time let us con&s;ider for a moment the real worth and value of a dramatic writer. To be at all a writer, of any eminence, is a proud di&s;tinction; men of letters, the bent of who&s;e genius is worthily conducted, who form the public ta&s;te, who expo&s;e the de|formity of vice, and inculcate the true principles of virtue, merit from their fellow citizens the mo&s;t honourable con&s;ideration; but a dramatic writer, he who puts &s;peculative truth into action, who com|mands our riche&s;t faculties, who pervades the re|ce&s;&s;es of rea&s;on, who opens the trea&s;ures of the heart, excites its pity, and its commi&s;eration, and
<PB N="5" REF="9">
teaches us to be men, and to be virtuous; to ac|quire this art, is to attain the noble&s;t privilege of human nature.</P>
<P>The dramatic art is the mo&s;t precious inherit|ance bequeathed us by the ancients. A dramatic poet is an honour to his fellow creatures. Let us &s;ee why the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor &s;hould be in|volved in unmerited obloquy; and why a man, who delights and in&s;tructs us in his counterfeit cha|racter, &s;hould be an object of indi&s;criminate re|proach in his real character.</P>
<P>It is extremely difficult to conceive upon what principle, or from what circum&s;tance this unworthy prejudice took its ri&s;e. Is it that actors are men of &s;tronger intellectual power and intelligence than the common herd of mankind? No. Individuals may be envious, the public are always generous. Is it that becau&s;e actors are paid to amu&s;e and in&s;truct the world they ought to be con&s;idered as purcha&s;ed &s;laves of the will? No. Barri&s;ters, par|&s;ons, and &s;enators, are treated with re&s;pect.</P>
<P>What is the cau&s;e? That an actor is the main &s;pring of the dramatic art it is impo&s;&s;ible to deny. Vainly &s;hall the poet paint a faithful portrait of men and manners; his labour &s;hall remain a lifele&s;s lump
<PB N="6" REF="10">
till it receive a promethean touch from the fire of the actor. Nay, in this the public &s;eem to ac|quie&s;ce; for the la&s;t in&s;trument, through the me|dium of which they immediately receive their plea|&s;ures, will ever be more con&s;idered as the intimate and welcome object of their commendation than the author, to who&s;e per&s;on they are perfect &s;trangers, and to who&s;e merits they would have remained &s;o but for the actor.</P>
<P>ROSCIUS is &s;aid to have given a mo&s;t perfect idea of all the impa&s;&s;ioned variety contained in the celebrated orations of CICERO without uttering a word. What perfect materials then mu&s;t have com|po&s;ed the extraordinary mind of this wonderful man. But how &s;hall we have to admire the &s;trength of his head, and the goodne&s;s of his heart, if we believe CICERO him&s;elf, who tells us that ROSCIUS not only knew how to di&s;&s;eminate virtue among his auditors better than any other man, but was more correct in his practice of virtue in private life.</P>
<P>I know it may be oppo&s;ed to me that actre&s;&s;es, in all ages, have made terrible &s;avages among the hearts of the &s;pectators, and that the oeconomy of many families has been too often deranged by the influence of their charms. Women, ornamented pro&s;e&s;&s;edly with an intention to captivate, will ever
<PB N="7" REF="11">
improperly attract the notice of the young and the irregular. The graces of beauty and talents, en|hanced by the inticements of dre&s;s, naturally beget admiration and plea&s;ure, and too many hu&s;bands and fathers have certainly &s;acrificed their wives and children at this &s;hrine of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. Nay, I am afraid, the &s;cene has been, in &s;ome in&s;tances, rever&s;ed; and that the actor, while recommending con&s;tancy and honour from the &s;tage, has rai&s;ed &s;en|&s;ations, throughout the boxes, not perfectly con&s;i&s;t|ent with virtue in the brea&s;ts of the matron and the ve&s;&s;al.</P>
<P>But admitting this argument in its fulle&s;t extent, why is this remarked in particular of actors and ac|tre&s;&s;es? I an&s;wer, becau&s;e of the publicity of their &s;ituation. Were the private conduct of individuals in all other &s;tations as well known, the world would be found to be a univer&s;al theatre no le&s;s in its particular then in its general manners. But there every irregularity is as much as po&s;&s;ible hu&s;hed up or glo&s;&s;ed over; and, but for the intervention now and then of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall and Doctor's Com|mons, the great who look down on the &s;tage would be con&s;idered as irreproachable and exemplary characters.</P>
<P>As to the Bar; as there certainly have been
<PB N="8" REF="12">
in&s;tances in the private conduct of its members of rapacity and, I am afraid, di&s;honour; it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that individuals, for I contend for no more, have been remarkable for a &s;uperior degree of propriety, in their families and connections, than their neighbours; and of the Pulpit I &s;hall only &s;ay, that churches are notoriou&s;ly places of a&s;&s;ignation, and that three-fourths of tho&s;e unhappy wretches, who have been driven to pro&s;titution by the arts of &s;ome young rake, or, perhaps, the overbearing landlord of their fathers, always begin the wretched &s;tory of their misfortunes, by telling you that they are clergymens daughters.</P>
<P>I could go a great way into this, but that it would be foreign to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, and I &s;hall have mo&s;t powerful occa&s;ion to illu&s;trate this point hereafter. I &s;hall, therefore, only ob&s;erve, that an object, however perfect, when placed upon a pina|cle, will appear to the purblind view of general ob|&s;ervation to have many deformities, while the mo&s;t rickety piece of real deformity &s;hall halt through the croud without attracting particular notice. In|dividuals, of all profe&s;&s;ions, de&s;erve reprehen&s;ion, actors as well as others. Are all profe&s;&s;ions, there|fore, to be &s;tigmatized much le&s;s the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor exclu&s;ively? The idea is revolting, un+worthy, and unju&s;t. Perfection is not the lot
<PB N="9" REF="13">
of human nature. Let not any part of the public, therefore, become obnoxious to cen&s;ure by acting a perpetual &s;oleci&s;m them&s;elves in decrying tho&s;e with their tongues whom it is their greate&s;t plea&s;ure to applaud with their hands.</P>
<P>As to the third propo&s;ition I &s;tand nearly upon the &s;ame ground with other hi&s;torians; and I can freely an&s;wer, that, if credit may be given to the various authors who have admitted the merit, and pointed out the beauties of the ancient and modern dramatic poets; who, by relating the events of &s;tates and empires, have nece&s;&s;arily involved in their nar|rations a hi&s;tory of tho&s;e arts which have forwarded the great work of civilization; if the fidelity with which men more correctly &s;peak of what intere&s;ts the imagination than what merely relates to their affairs, which is remarkably apparent in whatever can be collected of the theatres; if the&s;e can be re|lied on, then are the events contained in this hi&s;tory of &s;ufficient authority to intere&s;t the public.</P>
<P>I am not to learn the prodigious difficulty of pronouncing any thing to be true; or, with what diffidence and caution men ought to explore the labrynth of events, which cannot be known to him but through the clue of the hi&s;torian, often mi&s;led, and generally partial. Vague tradition may be true: apparent demon&s;tration may be falible.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="14">A biographer of Sir WALTER RALEIGH in|forms us, that when he had nearly fini&s;hed the &s;e|cond volume of his <HI>Hi&s;tory of the World,</HI> being then a pri&s;oner in the Tower, his attention was attracted by a di&s;pute between an officer and a private cen|tinel under his window. It appeared to him that the officer had improperly treated the poor &s;oldier, and that the man had, with equal firmne&s;s and mo|de&s;ty, remon&s;trared again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion. A mob crouded about the di&s;putants, and this was all he could collect of the affair.</P>
<P>A friend &s;oon afterwards came to vi&s;it him, to whom he related what he thought he had witne&s;&s;ed. It turned out, however, that this friend had not only been pre&s;ent at the di&s;pute but a mediator in it, and had been, therefore, perfectly competent to a&s;cer|tain exactly the fact; which was, that the &s;oldier had behaved very ill, and that the officer, in con&s;i|deration of a proper conce&s;&s;ion, had, with great manline&s;s and forbearance, forgiven him, when he might, con&s;i&s;tently with his duty, have puni&s;hed him.</P>
<P>Having heard his friend patiently out, Sir WAL|TER, with great coolne&s;s and determination, is &s;aid to have &s;eized the different papers which compo&s;ed his work and thrown them behind the fire, ex|claiming; <Q REND="inline">"How &s;hould I dare to avouch the au|thenticity
<PB N="11" REF="15">
of facts which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed at &s;uch di&s;tant times, and in &s;uch remote parts of the world, when tho&s;e in a common occurrence that pa&s;&s;es under my window, are directly oppo&s;ite to my comprehen&s;ion of them."</Q></P>
<P>This circum&s;tance is indeed doubted, for we are told by another writer, that Sir WALTER burnt the &s;econd volume of his work becau&s;e the fir&s;t &s;old &s;o &s;lowly as to ruin his book&s;eller; and we are told, by him&s;elf, that this &s;econd and a third volume were only in preparation, but, as it is admitted on all &s;ides, that the materials for &s;uch a work exi&s;ted but were de&s;troyed, this chain of circum&s;tances concur to render the above relation probable. Be it, there|fore, literally or virtually fact, it would be a lamen|table thing that every author &s;hould be actuated by the &s;ame delicate &s;cruples. It would go to the anihilation of enquiry, and facts them&s;elves, how|ever &s;upported, would be &s;uppo&s;ed never to have exi&s;ted. I own that circum&s;tances, univer&s;ally ad|mitted, have been differently attributed; but are we to infer from this that the&s;e circum&s;tances never oc|curred at all? Seven towns are &s;aid to comend for the birth of HOMER. Are we, therefore, to believe that there was no &s;uch per&s;on as HOMER. Indeed this la&s;t has been &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on. The <HI>Fables</HI> of AESOP have been attributed to HOMER, to SO|CRATES,
<PB N="12" REF="16">
and even to SOLOMON. This does not prove they were not written, for by &s;ome means or other we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and a mo&s;t won|derful work they are.</P>
<P>In the&s;e &s;ituations what are we to do? Since the certainty is &s;o difficult to come at, we are to take the probability; which, in the bu&s;ine&s;s of AESOP, appears to be this: Fable was a poeticle vehicle at the time of HOMER and HESIOD; and, no doubt, was u&s;ed by them; but AESOP, having perfected what others began, is con&s;idered as the Father of Fable, ju&s;t as AESCHYLUS is called the Father of Tragedy.</P>
<P>It is not, therefore, that becau&s;e the leading fea|tures of facts are difficult to a&s;certain, that facts them&s;elves are actually to be rejected. The germ of truth &s;eems to be planted in the minds of all in|tellectual beings; and, though uncertain hi&s;tory, and more uncertain tradition, may have involved great events in doubt and contradiction, yet, that very doubt, and that very contradiction, have often gone to e&s;tabli&s;h unan&s;werable confirmation that tho&s;e events did exi&s;t.</P>
<P>How very &s;imilar is the war of the giants with the gods, to the war of the malignant angels with
<PB N="13" REF="17">
the good. How remarkable is the re&s;emblance of <HI>Deucalion and Pyrrha,</HI> to <HI>Noah and the Flood.</HI> So the univer&s;al admiration of a SUPREME BEING, ac|knowledged throughout creation even to the mo&s;t ignorant idolaters&mdash;but the theme is endle&s;s; and, in the inve&s;tigation of great truths, the wonder is not that falible human nature &s;hould err &s;o much, but that it &s;hould err &s;o little.</P>
<P>As to the auxiliary propo&s;ition, its exi&s;tence is made out by e&s;tabli&s;hing the three others; for, if the &s;tage be a vehicle to in&s;truct and amu&s;e; if the primary and relative characters are of univer&s;al celebrity; if the truth of the events are virtually confirmed by as indi&s;putable authority as the events of other hi&s;tories: then the &s;ubject of this work is of &s;ufficient moment, its characters of &s;ufficient im|portance, and its facts of &s;ufficient authenticity to intere&s;t the public; and, if, through this &s;ubject, the&s;e characters, and the&s;e facts, the &s;weete&s;t emo|tions that penetrate the brea&s;t, are excited; if the dangerous pa&s;&s;ions of hate, envy, avarice, and pride, with all their inumerable train of attendant vices, are detected and expo&s;ed; if love, friend&s;hip, gra|titude, and all tho&s;e active and generous virtues which warm and exalt the mind, are held up as ob|jects of emulation; if ignorance is &s;couted, genius
<PB N="14" REF="18">
encouraged, and a true poli&s;h &s;et on that mirror which the wi&s;es men of all ages have &s;elected as the mo&s;t unerring vehicle to reflect the manners of mankind: then mu&s;t this work create intere&s;t to &s;uch a degree as e&s;&s;entially to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of truth and morality.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. ASIATIC THEATRE.</HEAD>
<P>CHINA more than three thou&s;and years ago cul|tivated that art which &s;omewhat later contributed to the renown of GREECE. The early principle of the ancient drama was to pre&s;ent living portraits of the times and manners, to reprehend vice, and in|culcate morality and virtue, through the medium of action and dialogue. The drama, for a con&s;i|derable time, was only held in honour throughout the va&s;t country of CHINA, and the &s;ingle town of ATHENS. ROME did not adopt it till four hundred years afterwards.</P>
<P>The tragedies repre&s;ented by the Chine&s;e were on moral &s;ubjects, &s;upported by the examples of their heroes, and the maxims of their philo&s;ophers. The &s;cenes and habits were prodigiou&s;ly magnifi|cent: their pieces, however, had neither regularity, intere&s;t, nor probability. Angels and devils were indi&s;criminately introduced, and whatever could convey a my&s;tic &s;en&s;e of moral duty was awkwardly enforced, no matter by what means. They had,
<PB N="16" REF="20">
however, performances of various kinds, calculated merely to entertain and &s;urpri&s;e the &s;pectators. An incredible number of extraordinary feats both of legerdemain and tumbling made up &s;ome of the&s;e, which they performed in &s;o wonderful a manner, that if we credit the accounts we read, all we have ever &s;een of this &s;pecies of amu&s;ement in EUROPE, cannot boa&s;t the &s;malle&s;t compari&s;on of the mo&s;t trifling of their tours in this way. The&s;e were per|formed, however, in &s;till greater perfection by monkies and mice, the &s;ubtilties of which animals, it will ea&s;ily be credited, have often made them pa&s;s for devils and &s;orcerers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What an admirable idea for a pantomime in the Chri&s;tmas-holidays! I hope it will be improved upon. A lion, according to AESOP, owed his pre&s;ervation to a mou&s;e: why &s;hould the Engli&s;h theatres, which bear, as their protection, the lion of ENGLAND, he|&s;itate to promote their glory by the &s;ame means. Neither the <HI>learned pig,</HI> the <HI>hare,</HI> nor even <HI>general Jacko</HI> could cope with the mice. Mice have been of con&s;equence ever &s;ince HOMER. I beg I may not be thought wickedly to allude to the mountain and the mou&s;e: we know the theatres are bringing forth &s;uch mice as the&s;e every day, but they are not of the true Chine&s;e breed. I would, therefore, ad|vi&s;e to &s;end for &s;ome of the right &s;ort, in the fir&s;t &s;hips, and who knows, if the mice &s;hould grow as &s;ond of Engli&s;h corn as Eunuchs are of Engli&s;h guineas, but CHINA may prove of as great advantage to the theatre, as ITALY has done to the opera-hou&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We are told by different travellers, that, though the Per&s;ians and the Indians are &s;aid, to be the in|ventors
<PB N="17" REF="21">
of dramatic entertainments, owing, proba|bly, to their grote&s;que and fanciful dances, for which they are &s;o famous, the Chine&s;e claim an indi&s;|putable right to be acknowledged as the original founders of this art, which, though the &s;everity of their manners prevented them from authorizing, was exhibited at the palaces of their riche&s;t mandarines where regular theatres were fitted up.</P>
<P>On days of regaling it was the cu&s;tom to invite friends and &s;end for actors, who brought with them li&s;ts of &s;uch pieces as they were prepared to per|form. I have before me a hi&s;tory of one of tho&s;e days of performance, which will &s;hew, that though the Chine&s;e never arrived to the regularity of the Greeks, at the time of AESCHYLUS, yet the drama, and all its be&s;t purpo&s;es, were as warmly felt then at CHINA as it was afterwards at Athens.</P>
<P>The piece, preceded by a prologue, was taking from hi&s;tory. An Emperor appeared &s;ur|rounded by an admiring multitude on whom he had heaped benefits. His virtues became the &s;ubject of their eulogium, and they &s;ometimes recited, and &s;ometimes chanted orations to his prai&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. GRECIAN THEATRE, FROM ITS ORIGIN TO THE TIME OF AESCHYLUS.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH we find traces of the dramatic art in all nations back to the remote&s;t antiquity, even 'till its origin, is lo&s;t in the night of time, yet it &s;eems to have attained no perfection till it became memora|ble in GREECE. Simplified there, it grew intere&s;t|ing and important. It celebrated among that peo|ple recent events of which their fathers had been witne&s;&s;es. All the &s;ubjects of their theatre were comprized in the hi&s;tories of a few families; no foreign heroes pre&s;umed to u&s;urp tho&s;e tears that deplored the mi&s;fortunes of their proper citizens.</P>
<P>In the theatre, as in the field, and in the areo|pagus the Greeks were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;pirit of real patrioti&s;m. They acknowledged the repre&s;en|tative of no hero but in his true hi&s;tory, and a great action had no charms for them unle&s;s it was legi|timate, and as it were naturalized. Liberty con|verted every town into an empire, and the greatne&s;s
<PB N="27" REF="31">
of &s;oul which in&s;pired this fame in&s;pired poets with the genius to celebrate it.</P>
<P>A tragedy was not merely art amu&s;ement, not an exhibition to beguile a moment of lei&s;ure, it was an affair of &s;tate; and the Athenian &s;pecta|tors &s;aw their duty as men through the tran&s;parent veil of allegory: nor was there a Grecian &s;ailor who did not ta&s;te the beauties of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES.</P>
<P>Inclination to occupy time, with a view to de&s;|troy that la&s;&s;itude natural to man, begat in him a ta&s;te for tho&s;e &s;tudies which are called the arts, and which are purely an imitation of nature. The Gy|mna&s;tic and other exerci&s;es in GREECE were thus improvements of &s;imilar games, to which all people have been accu&s;tomed ever &s;ince the primitive union of man into &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The I&s;thmian games in&s;tituted in honour of NEP|TUNE, and revived with particular attention by THESEUS, king of ATHENS, who reigned twelve hundred years before the chri&s;tian aera, were the fir&s;t, of which poetry and mu&s;ic made apart. In the&s;e games were introduced the &s;ports of the cha&s;e, where were &s;een rare and &s;carce animals, purpo&s;ely brought from all parts of the known world, and
<PB N="28" REF="32">
the&s;e games in the end fixed the epoch of all the inhabitants of the I&s;thmus of CORINTH.</P>
<P>Seven centuries after THESEUS, THEMISTOCLES in&s;tituted a new combat of poetry and mu&s;ic, which made a part of the Panathanean Fea&s;ts, in honour of MINERVA. In the&s;e fea&s;ts dramatic pieces were introduced. Each poet was permitted to bring forward, to the number of four, and this a&s;|&s;emblage was called <HI>Tetralogy.</HI> The prize of the victors was a crown of olive branches and a barrel of oil, which was con&s;idered as a pre&s;ent from the godde&s;s who&s;e glory the&s;e &s;ports celebrated. We know not what the&s;e dramatic pieces were at that time; there were none of any particular di&s;tinction, the term Tragedy confounded every thing, and it was long after this period that the art had its divi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Tragedy, according to an ancient tradition, ge|nerally adopted, owed its origin to an accident. ICARIUS, the proprietor of a village in ATTICA, where it is &s;aid the vine was originally cultivated, having one day found a he-goat fea&s;ting on his grapes, killed it and divided it among his pea&s;ants; who, in their merriment, decorated them&s;elves with branches of trees and danced round the animal de&s;tined for their banquet. This novelty attracted
<PB N="29" REF="33">
numbers of &s;pectators, who were &s;o &s;truck with it, that, at length, it became a cu&s;tom in &s;everal places during the wine harve&s;t.</P>
<P>As the&s;e pea&s;ants grew intoxicated at their fea&s;ts, and the greate&s;t part of them had rea&s;on to com|plain of &s;uch Athenians as had large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the country, they abandoned them&s;elves without re&s;erve to their re&s;entment, braved their oppre&s;&s;ors, and called aloud at their doors for redre&s;s, to the great entertainment of the multitude that &s;urrounded them. The chiefs of ju&s;tice even authorized this annual remon&s;trance of an oppre&s;&s;ed people, taking care, however, that the fear of cha&s;ti&s;ement and the danger of reproach &s;hould operate &s;o as to prevent violence. This method became a remedy again&s;t public di&s;order, and the fea&s;t of the goat was at length introduced at ATHENS.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants were invited from all parts to ap|pear at this &s;pectacle, which was performed in a field near a grove of poplars called OEgyron, and the branches of the trees, interlaced, &s;erved as a &s;ort of &s;caffold, from whence the performers amu&s;ed the multitude. The field being near the Temple of Bacchus, this entertainment in&s;en&s;ibly intro|duced it&s;elf as a part of the wor&s;hip of the God of Wine.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="34">During the &s;acrifice, the prie&s;ts and the people &s;ung hymns to the Deity in chorus, which, from the name of the victim, were called <HI>Tragedy; or Song of the Goat.</HI> The&s;e fea&s;ts became general, not only in the temples, but in the villages, where a man, in the character of SILENUS, rode on an a&s;s, and was followed by a promi&s;cuous troop of vo|taries, who, gla&s;s in hand, &s;ung ver&s;es in honour of BACCHUS.</P>
<P>The&s;e monotonous hymns, however, grew very tire&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting till EPIGENE, a Sicyonian, conceived the idea of giving a new form to this &s;pecies of &s;pectacle. He produced a tragedy le&s;s objectionable, which he entitled <HI>Bacchus</HI>; but it was, however, &s;o little to the honour of the god, that the &s;pectators, at its fir&s;t repre&s;entation, cried put, <Q REND="inline">"What has this to do with BACCHUS?"</Q> This critici&s;m proves that though they yet knew but little of the dramatic art, its germ, which afterwards bur&s;t forth and grew to perfection, exi&s;ted at that time in the Greeks.</P>
<P>THESPIS, who, was born at Icaria, a town of Attica, fatigued like the re&s;t with this barbarous non&s;en&s;e that outraged the under&s;tanding of the people, and di&s;honoured the god it profe&s;&s;ed to idolize, determined to write pieces and introduce
<PB N="31" REF="35">
recitation. This novelty plea&s;ed. He produced &s;everal entertainments of this de&s;cription, which he and others repre&s;ented from village to village mounted on a cart, from whence they declaimed in grote&s;que dre&s;&s;es, and with faces frightfully painted.</P>
<P>BACCHUS was very &s;oon after this left out of the party, for now both THESPIS and EPIGENE em|ployed them&s;elves in expo&s;ing the vices and follies of their countrymen; and to as good a purpo&s;e as ICARIUS and his companions, who, as we have &s;een, brought their oppre&s;&s;ors of ATHENS by the &s;ame method to rea&s;on and a &s;en&s;e of their duty as citizens.</P>
<P>The&s;e laudable attempts, however, were not long attended with &s;ucce&s;s, for, though the people, when they became accu&s;tomed to them li&s;tened with great &s;atisfaction, SOLON oppo&s;ed them as a danger|ous innovation. He forbad THESPIS not only to write but to teach the art of compo&s;ing tragedies at ATHENS, probably becau&s;e he had at that time &s;o many jarring intere&s;ts to reconcile<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At the time when SOLON was in the zenith of his reputation at ATHENS, THESPIS one day was performing a tragedy, at which the people appeared wonderfully plea&s;ed. When it was over, SO|LON a&s;ked the author whether he was not a&s;hamed to tell &s;o many lies in the face of the world? Not at all, &s;aid THESPIS, tis only je&s;t. In je&s;t! cried SOLON, &s;triking his &s;tick vehemently again&s;t the ground, &s;o much the wor&s;e; tho&s;e who encourage fal&s;ehood in je&s;t may at la&s;t approve of it in earned; and I &s;hould not wonder, if this were long permitted, that by rejecting truth, our government and our public affairs &s;hould in like manner become the je&s;t of the people.</NOTE>. This prohi|bition
<PB N="32" REF="36">
&s;eems, however, to be but little regarded, for THESPIS after this not only wrote tragedies but had for a &s;cholar PHRYNICHUS, an Athenian. He is &s;poken of as the fir&s;t who made hi&s;tory the &s;ubject of tragedy, who introduced the characters of wo|men on the &s;tage, and who invented tetrametre ver&s;e.</P>
<P>PHRYNICHUS was condemned to pay a thou|&s;and drachms for having produced a piece called <HI>Miletus taken by Darius.</HI> He was con&s;idered by the Athenians the more culpable becau&s;e he had forced tears from the &s;pectators at the moment he painted in lively colours the de&s;olation of that town; and thus he was at once the victim of their pride, and the object of their plea&s;ure. Notwith&s;tanding, however, his countrymen per&s;ecuted him for plea&s;ing them, he afterwards became a general in the army, and to this was, probably, owing the vehemence which appeared to characterize his tragedies.</P>
<P>ALCEUS, another Grecian, held a high rank
<PB N="33" REF="37">
among the tragic poets of that time. There cannot be collected, however, more than the titles of two of his pieces.</P>
<P>CHOERILUS is &s;aid to have written a hundred and fifty tragedies, and to have been thirteen times crowned victor. The prize obtained upon the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;till adverted to the fea&s;ts of BACCHUS, for it con&s;i&s;ted of a goat and a mea&s;ure of wine. Nothing is known of the&s;e pieces of CHOERILUS, except one of them, but he is memorable for be|ing the fir&s;t who decorated the &s;cene, and habited the actors like the per&s;ons they repre&s;ented<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CHOERILUS was con&s;idered by SUIDAS and ANTHENAEUS as the original author of Ma&s;ques; there can be no doubt, however, but the pieces anterior to THESPIS are of that &s;pecies. HORACE attributes them to AECHYLUS; which, by the bye, is a conjecture ventured very much at hazard, for they are in no re&s;pect in his &s;tyle; but ARISTOTLE, with more good &s;en&s;e, informs us, that the real inventor of them, and even the time when they were originally in|troduced is unknown. The fact is this: All the dramatic pieces, both in ASIA and el&s;ewhere before AECHYLUS, were an irregular jumble of recitation and &s;inging, and therefore Ma&s;ques.

five pieces, which, like the re&s;t, were nothing more than a &s;ort of dithyrambic, begun as we have &s;een by THESPIS, and in &s;ome degree improved after|wards; but it remained for AESCHYLUS, to di&s;pel this mi&s;t and eclip&s;e the&s;e con&s;tellations which, at his appearance, receded like &s;tars at &s;un ri&s;e.</P>

<P>AESCHYLUS, who was hailed the Father of Tragedy, &s;oon &s;implified and regulated dramatic repre&s;enta|tions. He divided his pieces into acts, or epi&s;odes, that contained the expo&s;ition of the &s;ubject, the conduct of the plot, and the development of the cata&s;trophe. He re&s;erved the primitive chorus, no otherwi&s;e, however, than as an auxiliary, for the pur|po&s;e of rendering the &s;ubject more intere&s;ting<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tragedy was originally, as we have &s;een, no more than a &s;ingle per&s;on who &s;ung dithyrambics or hymns in prai&s;e of BACCHUS. THESPIS added a &s;ingle per&s;on to relieve the chorus. AESCHYLUS finding a &s;ingle per&s;on unintere&s;ting, added a &s;econd, and at the &s;ame time threw the chorus, as much as po&s;&s;ible, into the back ground. All that had been performed between the four &s;ongs of the chorus they called <HI>Epi&s;ode</HI>; the &s;ongs of the chorus being the acts, and the epi&s;ode the act time. But when tragedy came to be formed by AESCHYLUS, the matter was rever&s;ed, and what had been the auxiliary became the principal. Then the intere&s;t of the piece was the primary object and the chorus, which was now u&s;ed merely as an interval between the acts, &s;till heightened the effect of the piece it&s;elf by, &s;ometimes reciting, and &s;ometimes &s;inging, &s;uch &s;ubjects as belonged to it im|mediately, or as illu&s;trated &s;ome point relative to it. The recitation was performed by their chief called CHORYPHEUS, who fir&s;t recited and then led the &s;ong followed by the re&s;t, I &s;hould not wonder at &s;eeing an a&s;&s;ertion that this was the original idea of the fugue in mu&s;ic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="40">The degree of perfection to which AESCHYLUS brought the dramatic art in GREECE, procured him great re&s;pect and con&s;ideration, to which his public conduct, as a citizen, materially contributed.

He was the fir&s;t who brought two characters forward on the &s;tage at the &s;ame time; he invented the robe and the bu&s;kin, and con&s;iderably height|ened the effect of his pieces by appropriate deco|rations of the per&s;onages. His improvements were &s;o rapid and &s;o effectual that he was thought to have been in&s;pired.</P>
<P>PAUSANIUS &s;ays, that while AESCHYLUS was a&s;leep under the &s;hadow of a vine, BACCHUS ap|peared to him in a dream, and commanded him to write tragedies. This fable aro&s;e, probably, from his fondne&s;s for wine, for he wrote as he drank; and upon all occa&s;ions, invoked APOLLO le&s;s than BAC|CHUS, if we believe CALLISTHENES and PLUTARCH. Whatever god in&s;pired his ver&s;e, it is certainly full of nature, warmth, and energy. He is, however,
<PB N="37" REF="41">
reproached, and with rea&s;on, for introducing hard|ne&s;&s;es and crudeties; his images were gigantic and frightful, and the whole drift of his pieces was calculated to in&s;pire terror rather than pity or delight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Tragedy of <HI>Eumenides,</HI> written by AESCHYLUS, ORESTES in the fir&s;t act appeared &s;urrounded with furies lulled a&s;leep by APOLLO. Their dre&s;&s;es were black with &s;anguinary ornaments. In one hand they held a torch, from which i&s;&s;ued a faint and quivering flame, and in the other a rod of &s;erpents. Their heads were covered with furious adders, and their faces were &s;o frightfully horrible, that, the moment they awoke and begun to walk tumultuou&s;ly on the &s;tage, women were &s;aid to have mi&s;carried, and children to have died with fear.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be forgotten, however, that, tragedy, at the time of AESCHYLUS, was in its infancy, that; it was his offspring, and that he tru&s;ted it in the world that it might, by the fo&s;tering care of others, grow to maturity.</P>
<P>It has been warmly in&s;i&s;ted on, and &s;urely with good rea&s;on, that AESCHYLUS was le&s;s the perfecter of the works of THESPIS than the imitator of tho&s;e of HOMER. The Epopoeia is a more natural a&s;&s;i|mulation to tragedy than tho&s;e mon&s;trous rhap&s;odies which were chanted in honour of BACCHUS; and, though the prie&s;ts, upon this as upon all other oc|ca&s;ions, were glad enough to beget an intere&s;t in
<PB N="38" REF="42">
favour of their Deity, in who&s;e name they hood|winked the people; yet celebrating the atchieve|ments of kings and heroes among a nation of war|riors, was more likely to rou&s;e their feelings as it brought them acquainted with conduct which it was both their inclination and their duty to emu|late. Of this, mo&s;t probably, AESCHYLUS was aware, and as he imitated the heroes of HOMER with his &s;word, &s;o did he HOMER him&s;elf with his pen.</P>
<P>AESCHYLUS &s;erved at the battle of Marathon, and at the &s;ea fight of Salamis, where AMINIAS his brother commanded a &s;quadron of &s;hips and &s;ig|nalized him&s;elf above all the Athenians. To this brother our poet, upon a particular occa&s;ion, was indebted for his life. In one of his pieces he made THETIS, &s;peaking of APOLLO, utter &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ions which were con&s;idered as bla&s;phemy, and in another he introduced &s;ome equivocal plea&s;antries in allu&s;ion to the my&s;teries of CERES. For the&s;e crimes he was cha&s;ed from the theatre, and would have been &s;toned to death but for AMINIAS; who, throwing a&s;ide his cloak and &s;hewing the &s;lump of his arm, reminded the people of his gallantry at the fight of Salamis. This moved the &s;pectators to pity, and they pardoned AESCHYLUS, who, however, could not &s;tomach this indignity, and was, therefore,
<PB N="39" REF="43">
determined to withdraw from a place where his life had been in danger.</P>
<P>This determination was confirmed by the ne|glect of his pieces, and the ri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s of SO|PHOCLES, who obtained the prize from him, though &s;ome &s;ay it was SIMONIDES in an elegy on the bat|tle of Marathon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fact was that SIMONIDES was victor in the elegy on the battle of Marathon, and SOPHOCLES, as we &s;hall &s;ee hereafter, when CIMON brought back the bones of THESEUS. The battle of Mara|thon was fought three years after SOPHOCLES was born, and SIMON|EDES might certainly have on that occa&s;ion obtained a prize; but it &s;eems to have given AESCHYLUS very little concern, for he continued after that to write with unrivalled reputation for two and twenty years; and being then old, and his genius on the decline, no won|der SOPHOCLES, with the ardour of youth, and the example of &s;o great a ma&s;ter in his favour, got the better in this conte&s;t, which, every thing con&s;idered, appears to be no material deduction from the brilliant reputation of AESCHYLUS.</NOTE>. He, therefore, retired into SI|CILY, and was received into the court of HIERON, who was then building the city of AETNA, which our poet celebrated in a tragedy of the &s;ame name. Here he re&s;ided three years covered with honours, when his death was occa&s;ioned by a &s;ingular ac|cident.</P>
<P>An eagle having &s;oared a great height with a tortoi&s;e in his talons, let it fall on the head of AESCHYLUS, of which blow he died, and by his death
<PB N="40" REF="44">
&s;eemed to be verified a pretended declaration of the Oracle at DELPHOS, that a blow from heaven &s;hould accelerate the death of AESCHYLUS.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that the &s;eats of the theatre broke down during the repre&s;entation of one of the tragedies of AESCHYLUS; and SUIDAS tells us that it was the cau&s;e of his retiring into SICILY; but this is ab&s;urd, for the large croud nece&s;&s;ary to break down the &s;eats is a proof of the celebrity of AESCHYLUS; but he means to in&s;inuate, that with the &s;eats the reputation of AESCHYLUS which was eclip&s;ed by SO|PHOCLES, fell to the ground.</P>
<P>The operation of this accident, however, pro|claims in very loud terms the fame of AESCHYLUS, for from the&s;e ruins &s;prung up tho&s;e magnificent theatres, which were afterwards &s;o nobly imitated by the Romans. They were built circular on one &s;ide, and &s;quare on the other, the &s;emi-circle con|tained the &s;pectators, who were ranged in &s;eats, one above another, and in the quadrangle was exhibited the &s;pectacle. They had machines of every &s;ort for the conveyance of gods and godde&s;&s;es, which they &s;ummoned at plea&s;ure from the &s;ea, from hell, or from heaven. Their &s;cenes repre&s;ented palaces, and temples, &s;quares in per&s;pective, and towns in the di&s;tance. They had tran&s;forma|tions,
<PB N="41" REF="45">
embelli&s;hments, and every &s;pecies of decor|ation and ornament to be &s;een on the modern &s;tage, but prepared at a much greater expence; and, of cour&s;e, repre&s;ented with infinitely more grandeur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SOPHICLES gave additional magnificence to the con&s;truction of the theatres of ATHENS. The expence for the exten&s;ion of the&s;e edifices, and for the acqui&s;ition of what he thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ornament one of his tragedies, brought a reproach on the Athenians of having expended more riches on a &s;ingle dra|matic repre&s;entation, than in their wars again&s;t the barbarians.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Near that part of the building in which the &s;pectators &s;at, there were three porticos where they might retire in ca&s;e of bad weather; for it is re|markable that the ancient theatres were almo&s;t en|tirely uncovered. On the other hand, to prevent inconvenience from the heat of the &s;un, they ex|tended veils&mdash;&s;ome of which were very co&s;tly&mdash;by means of cords attached to the extremity of the building; and, that nothing might be omitted that could in the &s;malle&s;t degree contribute to their plea&s;ure, &s;tatues of excellent workman&s;hip were placed in regular order, &s;upporting urns, beautifully ornamented; tho&s;e urns receiving &s;treams deli|ciou&s;ly perfumed, which i&s;&s;ued from picture&s;que fountains, the whole variou&s;ly formed, and judici|ou&s;ly arranged.</P>
<P>The theatre was &s;o capacious that the actors
<PB N="42" REF="46">
were obliged to wear ma&s;ks, which were perfectly a machine calculated to extend the voice, &s;o that it might reach every ear in &s;o va&s;t a &s;pace; to faci|litate which, there were al&s;o va&s;es of bra&s;s placed in the intervals of the amphitheatre with &s;uch art, in &s;uch a direction, and compo&s;ed of &s;uch tempered materials, that they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the tones of the voice and in&s;truments; and, by this con&s;onance, ren|dered the &s;ound &s;tronger, more agreeable, and more di&s;tinct.</P>
<P>All the&s;e magnificent improvements &s;prung from the fall of AESCHYLUS, who&s;e theatre, like ANTEUS, touched the earth only that it might ri&s;e with renovated &s;trength<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are authors who di&s;pute this fact, and tell us that the accident, de&s;cribed above, happened during the repre&s;entation of a tragedy written by one PRATINAS. The probability appears to lye between the two &s;tories. The word &s;cene is originally from the Greek, and &s;ignifies a hut, a booth, a tent, or other place where dramatic repre&s;entations were anciently performed. The oegyron was u&s;ed as well to form a &s;tage as to &s;erve as a &s;helter for the populace. Thus the&s;e repre&s;entations from the fir&s;t were at times itinerant or &s;tationary according to circum&s;tances; and there can be no doubt but that the &s;cenic art, in the progre&s;s of its improve|ment, improved the &s;cene it&s;elf. Thus, &s;ometimes, fortuitou&s;ly, and &s;ometimes by de&s;ign, it became more and more regular till at length it attained to that &s;plendour which grew into magnificence under SOPHOCLES.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AESCHYLUS had two &s;ons, and five nephews, all
<PB N="43" REF="47">
of whom wrote with various &s;ucce&s;s for the theatre. BION, his &s;econd &s;on, was ranked among the poets called Railers, and was, probably, one of tho&s;e who wrote comedy. They are &s;aid to have written among them a prodigious number of pieces, &s;ome of which are yet to be &s;een; but, as AESCHY|LUS eclip&s;ed his predece&s;&s;ors, &s;o his imitators &s;erved only to rai&s;e the &s;uperior fame of SOPHOCLES.</P>
<P>SOPHOCLES was born at COLONOS, a town of ATTICA, in the fir&s;t year of the &s;eventy fir&s;t Olym|piad, which place he rendered afterwards celebrated by his tragedy of <HI>Oedippus of Colonos.</HI></P>
<P>SOPHOCLES operated a &s;econd revolution in tragedy. He introduced a third actor, and aug|mented the number of the chorus to fifteen in&s;tead of twelve, at which number AESCHYLUS had fixed it. He al&s;o allowed the chorus to have an intere&s;t in the main action, &s;o that by this means every thing was of a piece, and all the performers had &s;uch parts allotted them as contributed to one uniform and regular de&s;ign.</P>
<P>At the age of twenty-five he bore away the prize from his ma&s;ter, AESCHYLUS, in tragedy. An extraordinary occa&s;ion was the cau&s;e of this con|tention. CIMON, the Athenian general, had found
<PB N="44" REF="48">
the bones of THESEUS, and brought them in &s;olemn pomp to the city, on which a trial of &s;kill between the tragedians was in&s;tantly appointed. AESCHYLUS and SOPOHCLES &s;trove nobly for pre-eminence, but, in &s;pight of the acknowledged and admired merit of the ma&s;ter, the &s;uperior fire and eloquence of the &s;cholar bore away the palm.</P>
<P>Before SOPHOCLES, the prize was di&s;puted by four dramatic pieces comprized under the name of Tetralogy. The three fir&s;t were tragedies, and the fourth called <HI>Satire,</HI> being a &s;pecies of comedy; but this SOPHICLES altered, by oppo&s;ing, in all contentions, tragedy to tragedy.</P>
<P>SOPHOCLES did not always appear in his trage|dies on account of the weakne&s;s of his voice. His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ame was not, however, dimini&s;hed by this; for if AESCHYLUS merited the title of Father of Tragedy, SOPHOCLES might, with propriety be called the Ma&s;ter of it. The admiration and wonder with which all GREECE &s;poke of his wi&s;dom induced an opinion that he was the immediate favourite and inti|mate of the gods. We are told that AESCHYLUS conde&s;cended to vi&s;it him at his hou&s;e, and TULLY would have you believe that HERCULES had an equal re&s;pect for him. APOLLONIUS TYANENSIS, in his oration before DOMITIAN, tells the em|peror
<PB N="45" REF="49">
that SOPHOCLES, the Athenian, was able to check and re&s;train the impetuou&s;ity of the winds.</P>
<P>Certainly he was a genius of tran&s;cendant merit. His tragedies &s;erved as a model for ARISTOTLE's <HI>Art of Poetry,</HI> PLATO's advances in philo&s;ophy were compared with the improvements of SOPHO|CLES in tragedy; TULLY calls him the divine poet and VIRGIL has given him a marking pre|ference to all other writers of tragedy. So charm|ing was his poetry that he was called the Bee; and to tran&s;mit this eulogium to po&s;terity, a hive was carved upon his tomb, not le&s;s to impre&s;s the world with an idea of the &s;weetne&s;s of his ver&s;e than the diligence of his indu&s;try.</P>
<P>SOPHOCLES, like his predece&s;&s;or AESCHYLUS, was ranked among the defenders of his country. He commanded an army in conjunction with PER|ICLES to cha&s;ti&s;e the rebellious Samians; from which expedition he returned triumphant. His &s;ame followed him in every thing he undertook, even to old age, at which time, he is reported to have retained his faculties with all the fire and vi|gour of youth, and of this there is a remarkable in&s;tance.</P>
<P>SOPHOCLES had four &s;ons; who, tired with &s;o
<PB N="46" REF="50">
long a dependance on an old man, repre&s;ented him to the judges as a drivler, and a per&s;on inca|pable of governing his family, or taking charge of his affairs, SOPHOCLES confounded them by a trait which they little expected. He had ju&s;t fini&s;hed his <HI>Oedipus of Colonos,</HI> and all his an&s;wer to this unju&s;t accu&s;ation, was a reque&s;t that the judges would read his tragedy. They did &s;o, and found in it &s;uch &s;trength of mind, &s;uch beauty, &s;uch truth, and &s;uch per&s;ua&s;ion, that they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with an acclamation of prai&s;e, and his &s;ons covered with confu&s;ion; nay LUCIAN, who tells the &s;tory, adds, that the &s;ons were voted madmen for having accu&s;ed him.</P>
<P>There are three different accounts of the death of SOPHOCLES. PLINY, and VALERIUS MAXI|MUS, &s;ay that he died of exce&s;s of joy in his ninety-fifth year, at the &s;ucce&s;s of one of his tragedies. Others &s;ay, that in reciting his tragedy of <HI>Anti|gonus,</HI> he kept his breath &s;o long that it &s;topt the action of his lungs; but LUCIAN tells us that he was choked by a grape &s;tone<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis not wonderful that a man of ninety-five &s;hould die &s;ud|denly, nor that his death &s;hould be accelerated by an extraordinary effort of both mind and body. We may, therefore, believe that SOPHOCLES died immediately upon his great &s;ucce&s;s in gaining a prize &s;o late in life. It is al&s;o probable, that a grape &s;tone might accidently ha&s;ten his end, but the very &s;ame thing is told of AN|ACREON, and the a&s;&s;ertion has ever I believe, been con&s;idered more as poetic than true.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="51">PLUTARCH &s;ays, that one of the &s;ons of SO|PHOCLES was a cotemporary writer with his father, and from other authors we learn that another of his &s;ons, and two nephews, wrote pieces both tragic and lyric. We know nothing, however, of the&s;e pieces, or even of their titles.</P>
<P>EURIPIDES, according to &s;ome, was born at PHYLA, a town of ATTICA, and according to others at SALAMIS, about the fir&s;t year of the &s;eventy-fifth Olympiad. He is &s;aid to have been the pupil of ANAXAGORAS, and intimately known to SOCRATES. He fortunately di&s;covered the works of HERACLITUS, which were hid in the Temple of Diana; and from this commerce with the&s;e &s;ages, and the advantage he reaped from con|&s;ulting them, and reading their works, &s;prung that luminous moral which pervaded his tragedies.</P>
<P>SUIDAS &s;ays, that the mother of EURIPIDES was nobly de&s;cended; though ARISTOPHANES calls her a cabbage &s;eller, and VALERIUS MAXIMUS, taking the a&s;&s;ertion, which was probably a je&s;t, for
<PB N="48" REF="52">
truth, gravely records it. It &s;hould &s;eem, how|ever, that his parents were per&s;ons of &s;ome con&s;i|deration, for they con&s;ulted the Oracle of Apollo concerning him before he was born; and, having received an ambiguous promi&s;e that the world &s;hould witne&s;s his fame, and that he &s;hould gain a crown, they bred up their &s;on in a proper man|ner to qualify him for a wre&s;tler, under an idea that the Oracle meant no more than that he &s;hould ob|tain the Athletic crown, which he actually did, at the fea&s;ts in honour of CERES.</P>
<P>The genius of EURIPIDES, however, &s;oon im|pelled him to abandon the exerci&s;es of the body for the exerci&s;es of the mind; and fir&s;t he &s;tudied painting, in which he is &s;aid to have made a con&s;i|derable progre&s;s, but morality and philo&s;ophy were the &s;tudies mo&s;t congenial to his mind, and as the&s;e, philo&s;ophy particularly, had not yet been &s;o much the drift of dramatic repre&s;entations as he wi&s;hed, he determined to add this perfection to the &s;tage.</P>
<P>This gift which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent de|gree, though he improved the &s;tage in no other re|&s;pect, begat for him a mo&s;t extraordinary portion of cotemporary fame. His pieces are not &s;poken &s;o highly of as to perfectne&s;s as tho&s;e of SOPHOCLES, but the ver&s;es they contained were in the mouths
<PB N="49" REF="53">
of all countries where the Greeks were known. If pri&s;oners pleaded their cau&s;e in the language of EU|RIPIDES, their reward was life and liberty.</P>
<P>He was called the Philo&s;ophic poet. ALEX|ANDER is &s;aid to have admired him above all other writers; SOCRATES, who never had been accu&s;|tomed to vi&s;it the theatre, went there to hear the tragedies of EURIPIDES; DEMOSTHENES learnt de|clamation from them, and CICERO was in the act of reading them when he was &s;urrounded and a&s;&s;a|&s;inated.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it cannot be &s;aid that EURIPIDES did &s;o much for the po&s;thumous fame of the drama, or its real intere&s;t as SOPHOCLES. The chorus which SOPHOCLES had regulated, EURIPIDES al|tered and made it entirely independant of the main bu&s;ine&s;s. ARISTOTLE gives SOPHOCLES the pre|ference in manners, oeconomy, and &s;tyle. DIONY|SIUS HARLICARNASSENSIS commends SOPHOCLES for chu&s;ing the mo&s;t, generous and mo&s;t noble pa&s;|&s;ions for his &s;ubjects, whereas EURIPIDES cho&s;e di&s;hone&s;t, abject, and e&s;&s;iminate pa&s;&s;ions; and, again, becau&s;e SOPHOCLES never &s;ays any thing but what is exactly nece&s;&s;ary, while EURIPIDES amu&s;es the reader with oratorical deductions.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="54">In &s;hort, the general agreement between all tho&s;e who have written of the&s;e admirable authors is, that one amu&s;ed, the other convinced; one ap|pealed to the pa&s;&s;ions, the other to rea&s;on; one had the peculiar gift of impo&s;ing any thing for truth, the other had no eloquence but what was derived from truth it&s;elf.</P>
<P>EURIPIDES, it is &s;aid, wrote ninety-two tragedies, but the general belief is, that he wrote no more than &s;eventy-five, nineteen of which are extant, and the titles of fourteen others are recorded, but the pieces them&s;elves are not known. Like AESCHYLUS and SOPHOCLES, he met with an extraordinary death.</P>
<P>About a year after the Sicilians were defeated he left Athens and went to re&s;ide at the court of Macedon, being invited by ARCHILAUS, who was accu&s;tomed to confer acts of munificence on learned men, and even to rai&s;e them to very high honours. EURIPIDES, if SOLINUS &s;peaks truth, was made his prime mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>One evening in a wood, whether he had wan|dered in deep contemplation, he was &s;urrounded by dogs and torne to pieces. Different cau&s;es are a&s;&s;igned for this unfortunate death. Some &s;ay that
<PB N="51" REF="55">
the dogs were let loo&s;e upon him by his rivals, who had rea&s;on enough to be jealous of tho&s;e high di&s;|tinctions paid to him by ARCHELAUS; others that the whole was purely an accident, for that having &s;trayed while he was lo&s;t in meditation near a part of the palace, which was guarded by the&s;e dogs, as a &s;ecurity again&s;t depredators, he was there &s;urprized and thus became their victim.</P>
<P>Exaggerated accounts go &s;o far as to &s;ay that EURIPIDES was torn to pieces by women in re|venge for his having exclaimed again&s;t them in his tragedies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torians are &s;o extremely fond of introducing &s;imilar circum|&s;tances into the deaths of their celebrated men, that we &s;hould be wary as to the degree of credit we give them. Who does not &s;ee in this report of EURIPIDES, that his biographer has borrowed for him the death of ORPHEUS, who met with a &s;imilar fate from the women of THRACE, exactly as SOPHOCLES has been given the death of ANACREON. But on what ground mu&s;t the a&s;&s;ertion &s;tand, if it be true, and we are gravely informed it is &s;o, that there was no &s;uch per&s;on as ORPHEUS; that his adventures are a fable; and that his works, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been tran&s;mitted from the an|cients, and lately di&s;covered, are written by the ingenious and learned Dr. JORTON. But to go on a little further with EURI|PIDES. Not only the novelty of his extraordinary death is given to him, but his tomb is &s;aid to have been &s;truck with lightning as a &s;eal of divinity, which the memory of no man ever was honoured with before except LYCURGUS the lawgiver.</NOTE>, but to this no credit has been given. Indeed the general belief is, that either by accident or de&s;ign he met with the death above related.</P>
<P>With SOPHOCLES, who lived before and died
<PB N="52" REF="56">
after EURIPIDES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This a&s;&s;ertion bears it&s;elf out as well as mo&s;t of tho&s;e which pretend to a&s;certain any thing concerning antiquity. The majority of writers agree that SOPHOCLES was ninety-five when he died; if &s;o, he mu&s;t have lived three years after EURIPIDES. There is, however, a re&s;pectable Chronological Table which &s;ays, that he died at ninety-one, and that EURIPIDES lived a year after him.</NOTE>, died al&s;o every hope of advance|ment in tragedy. A great number of authors are &s;aid to have written tragedies, and to have borne away many prizes, but we know nothing of them of &s;ufficient celebrity to render their names worthy of particular notice; for they grew at la&s;t into &s;uch di&s;repute that their productions only &s;erved as food for the in&s;atiate appetite of ARISTOPHANES, by whom none of them were &s;pared; and nothing can be &s;o &s;trong a proof of degeneracy in tragedy as its falling &s;ucce&s;sfully under the la&s;h of the co|mic mu&s;e.</P>
<P>DIONYSIUS, the tyrant of SICILY, was am|bitious to be ranked among the tragic poets. LU|CIAN &s;ays that he procured &s;ome tablets, on which AESCHYLUS had &s;et down memorandums, that &s;erved as the ground work of his pieces, and, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed

of the&s;e, he thought he had come at the whole my&s;tery; but he was mi&s;erably deceived. No one gave him that credit which he flattered him|&s;elf he merited. To induce a general belief of his talents, he endeavoured to make the poet, PHILOX|ENUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PHILOXENUS was the &s;cholar of TELESTUS, a poet of &s;ome re|putation, they both wrote <HI>Dithyrambics,</HI> but neither of them regu|lar tragedy.</NOTE>, who&s;e pliability, as a courtier, he had rea&s;on to count upon, bol&s;ter up his fame, by te&s;tifying a full approbation of his ver&s;es.

<P>GREECE rendered the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed honours both to the works and the memory of her three tra|gic poets. An edict was i&s;&s;ued to erect their &s;tatues. Their works were pre&s;erved, and the greate&s;t part entered in the archives. PTOLEMY, king of EGYPT, was very anxious to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and above all of the works of EURIPIDES, to embelli&s;h his Alexandrian library; but they were refu&s;ed, and he, in his turn, refu&s;ed corn to the Athenians during a dearth. Nece&s;&s;ity at length obliged the Athenians to comply with his reque&s;t, and he, in return, nobly permitted the Athenian merchants to import as much corn as they plea&s;ed, without pay|ing the ordinary tribute.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. ARISTOPHANES AND MENANDER, AND THE PRO|GRESS OF COMEDY IN GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>THE real plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from comedy, with|out doubt, is founded on that &s;purious pride which delights the human heart when human nature is hu|miliated. Strange paradox! Yet clear as light.</P>
<P>Who does not feel him&s;elf proud when the frail|ties of his neighbour are held up to deri&s;ion? Who, that would choke with &s;pleen at the expo&s;ition of his own folly, does not rejoice with all his &s;oul when the follies of others are laid open to public view? Yet this ever was and is &s;till con&s;idered as the true drift of comedy; fal&s;ely, however, for la&s;h the manners how you may, you cannot correct them; on the contrary they will grow more callous at every &s;troke, and what is wor&s;e, every &s;troke will become more familiar and con&s;equently more tolerable.</P>
<P>The fault &s;eems to be that comedy has been given a latitude by much too exten&s;ive; and, as human frailties, up from the mo&s;t pardonable folly
<PB N="59" REF="63">
to the mo&s;t malicious vice, are a field immea&s;urable; all tho&s;e dramatic productions which have traver&s;ed this prodigious &s;pace, according as cu&s;toms and man|ners have varied, according as times and circum|&s;tances have inclined the public plea&s;ure, or policy, to tolerate them, and according to a number of other local and temporary circum&s;tances, have been denominated comedies.</P>
<P>It will be no difficulty, however, even &s;o early as when the theatre came to be regulated in GREECE, to &s;hew that the particular province of each dramatic production was known and clearly under&s;tood; and, though in &s;peaking of the pro|ductions of ARISTOPHANES, I &s;hall be compelled to &s;hew that comedy fluctuated and became irre|gular, it was only in conformity with tho&s;e manners of which it was bound to be the faithful repre&s;en|tative, and without which no dramatic writer can be popular.</P>
<P>Although all dramatic repre&s;entations were con|founded for a time in the word tragedy, which we have &s;een had not at all originally the &s;ignification which we now annex to it, nothing can be clearer than that the &s;pecies of performance which the French call a <HI>drame,</HI> and we a play, was what the Greeks under&s;tood as the model and criterion of
<PB N="60" REF="64">
their theatrical productions. The word is derived from the Greek, and &s;ignifies, literally, action, the mo&s;t honourable de&s;ignation of a dramatic piece, for without action it could have neither intere&s;t nor life.</P>
<P>Plays repre&s;ent mankind in their common and natural pur&s;uits, tragedies and comedies call them into &s;uch actions as they are not accu&s;tomed to but upon extraordinary occa&s;ions. A play has the pa|thetic of tragedy, and the playfulne&s;s of comedy, and is, in a general acceptation, infinitely more u&s;e|ful, more true, and more intere&s;ting. The end of tragedy is to make you cry, the end of comedy to make you laugh<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have read of a poet who, de&s;cribing the nature of his employ|ment to a clown, tells him, that among other things he writes tra|gedies, and comedies. <Q REND="inline">'What be they?' cries Clodpole.

<PB N="61" REF="65">
without violating either of them. To &s;tart an involuntary tear, as a tribute of &s;ympathy to do|me&s;tic woe, is a greater luxury than to expand a torrent of tears at the death of a heroine; and a &s;ingle benevolent &s;mile excited by a benificent ac|tion, the re&s;ult of nature and goodne&s;s, gladdens the mind more than a convul&s;ion of laughter at the pe|culiarities of a fellow creature, who, though deformed in his manners, is, perhaps, perfect in his heart.</P>

<P>Comedy certainly was attempted in GREECE at the time of THESPIS, and, perhaps, earlier. PHRY|NICHUS is &s;ometimes called the Comic Poet, and there are appearances which ju&s;tify this appellation. His pieces, very likely, were kind of Ma&s;ques; and,

<P>Comedy, however, though it was occa&s;ionally introduced, boa&s;ted no great reputation till after tragedy had grown to perfection, and it is not an unlikely conjecture that the fiat of SOPHOCLES, which had broken the tetralogy and kept tragedy apart as a &s;eparate province, having reduced co|medy to &s;hift for it&s;elf, it, from nece&s;&s;ity, re&s;umed &s;ufficient &s;trength to go alone, for we &s;oon after this &s;ee that it began to be exerci&s;ed &s;y&s;tematically.</P>
<P>Comedy having always been con&s;idered as a vehicle to hold folly up to ridicule, it took a dif|ferent bent according to the &s;pirit of the times. When the &s;upreme power was in the people, the
<PB N="64" REF="68">
poets, of cour&s;e, were at full liberty to &s;ay un|&s;paringly what they plea&s;ed, and of whom they plea&s;ed. Neither quality, office, age or &s;ex were &s;pared; every one was reproached by name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are opinions that this gave ri&s;e to the in&s;titution of the ten judges, to whom were given the power of whipping authors, who had fal&s;ely repre&s;ented the follies of their fellow citizens, and, therefore, arrogated a right to &s;courge others; but this does not ap|pear to be fairly the fact. It &s;hould &s;eem that the&s;e judges were originally appointed at the time when SOPHOCLES bore away the prize from AESCHYLUS: and PLUTARCH is very particular on this head The probability is this: Arbitrators who adjudged prizes to merit there were certainly of &s;ome de&s;cription or other, even as far back, as THESEUS; and, perhaps, earlier. In proportion as merit be|came more perfect and more dicided, the power of the&s;e judges en|crea&s;ed, and the judges them&s;elves were cho&s;en out of more re&s;pec|table tribes; till, at length, finding the comic poets &s;o formidable, it was nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e authority to licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and, therefore, the judges were given a power to humiliate and degrade, by corporal puni&s;hment, all tho&s;e who had unworthily endeavoured to humi|liate and degrade innocent and inoffen&s;ive characters. A meritorious re&s;triction; for while it encouraged the comic mu&s;e to &s;peak plain, it prevented her from offering fal&s;ehood.</NOTE>; and his &s;pecies of comedy was called the Ancient, or the Real, becau&s;e it convinced by &s;peaking truth.</P>
<P>When the people began to lo&s;e their power, and their liberties were ve&s;ted in fewer hands, it was no longer &s;afe to u&s;e &s;o bold a licen&s;e. The poets, therefore, had recour&s;e to a &s;econd di&s;tinction of comedy where the &s;ubject was real, and the cha|racter
<PB N="65" REF="69">
were feigned; and this was called the Mid|dle Comedy, becau&s;e, though it &s;till contained truth, it could only wound by companion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;pirit, however, of the Middle Comedy did not want for boldne&s;s, as the following anecdote of PHILIPPIDES will prove. STRATOCLES, the &s;ervile and abject flatterer of DEMETRIUS, and other per&s;ons of the &s;ame de&s;cription, inveighed again&s;t the dramatic writers on account of the liberties they took with their vices. The&s;e &s;atiri&s;ts avenged their cau&s;e with great &s;pirit. STRATOCLES and the re&s;t procured DEMETRIUS, when he vi&s;ited ATHENS, to be received with the &s;ame honours as CERES and BACCHUS. They even went &s;o far as to change the term Diony&s;ia, or Fea&s;ts of Bacchus, to De|metria. The gods were &s;aid in have been offended at this. The veil which held the figures of DEMETRIUS and ANTIGONUS, together with JUPITER and MINERVA, was rent a&s;under by a &s;udden &s;torm. Hemlock grew up near their altars; and, one day when the Diony&s;ia were to be celebrated, the proce&s;&s;ion was &s;topt by an exce&s;&s;ive and un&s;ea&s;onable cold, which bla&s;ted the corn, the vines, and the fig trees. The comic poets immediately attacked STRATOCLES and the other flatterers. <Q REND="inline">"Who was the cau&s;e," &s;aid PHILIPPIDES in one of his comedies, "that our vines were bla&s;ted by the fro&s;t, and that our &s;acred veil was rent a&s;&s;under? He who tran&s;ferred the ho|nour of the gods to men. It is he, not comedy, that is the ruin of the people."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>At length truth, even by compari&s;on, &s;uited ill with the luxury of the times, and the poets were obliged to invent both names and circum&s;tances; &s;o that if an application hit ever &s;o hard, no man was obliged to acknowledge the blow he had re|ceived; and this &s;ort of comedy, the whole being fictitious, was called The New. This la&s;t, however,
<PB N="66" REF="70">
ill &s;uited the temper of the Greeks and it grew into no repute till it was received among the Romans.</P>
<P>ARISTOPHANES, the boldne&s;s of who&s;e writings &s;pared neither friend nor foe, gave to the Middle Comedy all the force of the ancient, or real. The place of his birth is conte&s;ted; his enemies, of which he had de&s;ervedly a great number, repre&s;ent him as a &s;tranger; and his advocates, who were more &s;o out of fear than love, in&s;i&s;t that he was an Athenian. His pieces were chiefly written during the Pelopenne&s;ian war, &s;o that he was a cotem|porary of PLATO and SOCRATES. His reputation aro&s;e from his being an inveterate enemy to all tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to en&s;lave their country. Though his &s;tyle was by no means refined, his imagination was warm and lively, and his railery irre&s;i&s;tably keen and cutting, which he laid on un&s;paringly, and with a &s;pirit of unfeeling re&s;olution.</P>
<P>ARISTOPHANES was remarkable for expo&s;ing the vices of men in power, which he did with uncommon wit and &s;everity. CLEO was the fir&s;t he attacked, for which purpo&s;e he wrote the comedy of the <HI>Equites.</HI> None of the actors, however, would venture to per&s;onate a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o much power, and, therefore, ARISTOPHANES de|termined to perform the part him&s;elf. This he did
<PB N="67" REF="71">
with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s that the Athenians obliged CLEO to give a fine of five talents to the poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MADAME DACIER, of whom ARISTOPHANES &s;eems to have been a prodigious favourite, &s;ays in her preface to the tran&s;lation of his works, that his ridicule of CLEO was &s;o favourably received by the Athenians, that they ca&s;t flowers upon the head of the author and carried him through the &s;treets with the mo&s;t unbounded applau&s;e. They al&s;o, &s;he tells us, and &s;he &s;eems to have taken a great deal of pains to be certain of the fact, made a decree that he &s;hould be ho|noured with a crown of the &s;acred olive tree in the citadel, as a di&s;|tinction of the highe&s;t nature that could be paid to a citizen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His comedy of <HI>The Clouds</HI> &s;eems to be the mo&s;t celebrated of all his works, both on account of its &s;everity and the mi&s;chief it occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>It is by many believed that ARISTOPHANES, in a great mea&s;ure, occa&s;ioned the death of SOCRATES. At any rate that poet was very culpable in pub|licly accu&s;ing the philo&s;opher of impiety in his comedy of <HI>The Clouds</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">MADAME DACIER tran&s;lated this comedy; and, not contented with that, is &s;aid to have read it over two hundred times, and every time with fre&s;h plea&s;ure. SOCRATES was a man of inoffen&s;ive and irreproachable manners: he di&s;approved of the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the comic poets, both in their writings and in their conduct:&mdash;For this he was thought a proper object of &s;atire: for this ARISTOPHANES became the terror of virtue, and the idle of ATHENS and MADAME DACIER.</NOTE>. It was certainly his mo&s;t
<PB N="68" REF="72">
celebrated piece, and, therefore, it is &s;uppo&s;ed he had &s;ome &s;trong inducement to take &s;o much pains with it. This is &s;aid to be the hi&s;tory of the tran&s;|action.</P>
<P>ANYTUS and his party left no method untried to compa&s;s the de&s;truction of SOCRATES. But they feared the Athenians, who loved him, would revolt at any ouverte mea&s;ures; they, therefore, had re|cour&s;e to &s;tratagem, to execute which they em|ployed ARISTOPHANES. This artful and habile &s;atiri&s;t, who knew &s;o well to apply his arguments that they never failed of their full force, undertook the ta&s;k. He had long looked on the au&s;tere manners of SOCRATES as a fit &s;ubject on which to employ the gall that di&s;tilled from his pen. He accu&s;ed him in the open theatre of being an eloquent &s;educer, who, by the charms of his language and the witchery of his arguments, was &s;peciou&s;ly capable of reconciling every po&s;&s;ible contradiction. That, through the medium of this winning deceit, he had deluded the people and broached the mo&s;t dan|gerous doctrines; that he de&s;pi&s;ed the gods, and in|&s;pired all tho&s;e who li&s;tened to him with errors, tending to produce the mo&s;t &s;erious and alarming con&s;equences.</P>
<P>ARISTOPHANES played upon the &s;ubject with
<PB N="69" REF="73">
the &s;ame glare of fal&s;e rea&s;oning of which he had accu&s;ed SOCRATES; and, while he laboured to make it appear that another had impo&s;ed upon them, his own impo&s;ition was but too &s;ucce&s;sful. The Athenians had not the &s;malle&s;t expectation that any one would dare to broach &s;uch bold accu&s;ations, and, therefore, at fir&s;t, felt &s;ome re&s;entment; but being naturally di&s;tru&s;tful of all di&s;tingui&s;hed and extraordinary men, this comedy began to gain ground; and at length, for prejudice knows not where to &s;top, became more celebrated than any thing that had been exhibited in GREECE.</P>
<P>It cannot, however, but be allowed, that though all the ancients admired ARISTOPHANES for the true attic elegance of his &s;tyle, and though the moderns have in this, as in other things, very often they knew not why, yielded a blind obedience to the ancients, yet it were better that ARISTO|PHANES had never lived, or that he had employed his talents to worthier purpo&s;es; for, however he might have been admired by St. CHRYSOSTOM, who always laid him under his pillow when he went to bed; however SCALIGER may in&s;i&s;t that no one ought to judge of the Attic dialect who had not ARISTOPHANES at his fingers ends; however FRIS|CHLIN may have entered the li&s;ts with PLUTARCH

<P><PB N="71" REF="75">ARISTOPHANES is &s;aid to have written above fifty comedies, eleven of which are extant, and &s;ome of them are printed in different languages.

<P>We know nothing of when or where ARISTO|PHANES died, &s;o that all his extraordinary fortune happened to him in his life time.</P>
<P>After ARISTOPHANES the middle comedy gra|dually declined; for as the wits that came after him had not the merit to imitate him in his bold and &s;atirical &s;tyle of writing, their minor abilities na|turally turned to the fal&s;e and feeble parts of his works, in which he di&s;honoured his genius by pityful parodies of writings, infinitely more valuable to the cau&s;e of truth and literature than his own.</P>
<P>It was, however, the &s;ate of GREECE that the &s;tage &s;hould be once more re&s;cued from barbari&s;m. MENANDER, who was born at ATHENS, in the third year of the hundred and ninth Olympiad, intro|duced the new comedy, and thereby refined an

art that had been exerci&s;ed for fifty years with the mo&s;t unbridled profligacy and licentiou&s;ne&s;s. His incomparable merit quickly &s;pread his name to the remote&s;t nations. PLINY &s;ays, that the kings of EGYPT and MACEDON gave a noble proof of their admiration of him, by &s;ending amba&s;&s;adors, and even fleets, to bring him to their courts; but MENANDER was too much of a philo&s;opher to be tempted by the promi&s;es of the great.</P>
<P>The time continuing, however corrupt, his coun|trymen denied him that merit which he was allowed by &s;trangers, and therefore, e&s;tabli&s;hed, in his favour, the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible proof of his &s;uperior genius. This contumely he pitied and forgave; and though, through the ignorance and partiality of the judges, he often &s;aw the prize awarded to PHILEMON, a mi&s;erable cotemporary poet; he bore it with per|fect indifference, the only notice he ever took of it being when he a&s;ked PHILEMON whether he did not blu&s;h to wear the laurel.</P>
<P>MENANDER is &s;aid to have written above a hundred comedies, which are all unfortunately lo&s;t. We can only come at his works, therefore, through TERENCE, who borrowed four plays from him,
<PB N="73" REF="77">
though &s;ome &s;ay &s;ix, which are allowed to have lo&s;t much of their original &s;pirit.</P>
<P>We know, therefore, but little of MENANDER, but that little may &s;erve to give an exalted idea of his reputation. He &s;eems to have been in comedy what EURIPIDES was in tragedy. The old rhe|toricians recommend his works as the true and per|fect patterns of every thing beautiful and graceful in public &s;peaking. QUINTILIAN advi&s;es an ora|tor to &s;eek in MENANDER for copiou&s;ne&s;s of in|vention, for elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, and all that uni|ver&s;al genius which is able to accommodate it&s;elf to per&s;ons, things and affections.</P>
<P>MENANDER's wonderful talent of portraying na|ture in every condition, and under every accident of life, occa&s;ioned that memorable que&s;tion of AR|ISTOPHANES the grammarian: <Q REND="inline">"Oh MENANDER!

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. ACTORS, AND THE CONCLUSION OF THE GRECIAN THEATRE.</HEAD>
<P>ACTORS were held in honourable e&s;teem in GREECE; but this is only &s;aying that the Greeks honoured all tho&s;e who&s;e pur&s;uits were &s;timulated by any merit|orious emulation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">mi&s;e, that the arts which flouri&s;hed in perfection at ATHENS were little known or reli&s;hed in SPARTA, and it cannot but be con&s;idered as remarkable, that the Greeks, who were, in fact, but one people, &s;hould be divided into two kingdoms merely from manners, habits, and modes of thinking.</P>
<P>This, however, taken one way, may tell to the honour of the Spartans. Their manners were &s;o au&s;tere, and their conduct &s;o exact, that they re|jected every thing &s;uperfluous; and though amu&s;e|ments, poetry and mu&s;ic in particular, were but little encouraged among them, yet, &s;uch as they had
<PB N="76" REF="80">
a ta&s;te for, con&s;i&s;ted of pure &s;implicity and digni|fied expre&s;&s;ion. TERPANDER, who was both a poet and a mu&s;ician, PINDAR and other eminent men, though not Spartans, were admired in SPARTA.</P>
<P>Any thing but the mere &s;entiment in mu&s;ic and poetry, and its force and influence on the mind, the Lacedemonians rejected. Even when LYCURGUS in&s;tituted the &s;enate of thirty, including the two kings, they met in the open air, under an idea that a hall, or building of any kind, prepared for the purpo&s;e, might amu&s;e the attention with &s;uch trifles as pictures, or &s;tatutes, and &s;plendid ornaments, in|&s;tead of occupying it on &s;ubjects relative to the ge|neral welfare.</P>
<P>Theatres, in like manner, were di&s;couraged. AGESILAUS, who reigned in SPARTA forty-one years, held the theatre in contempt. One day CALLIPEDES, a celebrated Greek tragedian, ap|proached AGESILAUS and paid his re&s;pects to him, and having waited a con&s;iderable time in expectation that &s;ome honourable notice would be taken of him, &s;aid, at la&s;t, <Q REND="inline">"Do you not know me Sir?"</Q> The king looking at him with a contemptuous di&s;dain &s;aid, <Q REND="inline">"Are you not CALLIPEDES the &s;tage player?"</Q> Another time AGESILAUS was a&s;ked to hear a
<PB N="77" REF="81">
mimic who imitated the nightingale to perfection. <Q REND="inline">"No," &s;aid he, "I have heard the nightingale her&s;elf."</Q></P>
<P>Nay, this di&s;like, or rather &s;everity of manners, extended even to their &s;laves. When the Thebans invaded LACONIA, they took pri&s;oners a number of the Helotes, whom they ordered to &s;ing the odes of TERPANDER, ALEMON, or SPENDON, the Lacedemonian; but they excu&s;ed them&s;elves, &s;ay|ing, that it was forbidden by their ma&s;ters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PHYRNIS, the mu&s;ician, added two &s;trings to the harp, making them in all nine. The&s;e two &s;trings, were afterwards taken away, but TIMOTHEAN, the famous dithyrambic poet and mu&s;ician, ex|tended the number of &s;trings to twelve. He was, however, &s;everely puni&s;hed by the rigid Spartans, under an idea that luxury of &s;ound would e&s;&s;eminate the people.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But if the dramatic art was &s;lighted in SPARTA, it was care&s;&s;ed with enthu&s;ia&s;m in ATHENS; and, indeed, in all the countries into which the Grecians penetrated. Every general of any eminence had in his camp his poets, his mu&s;icians, and his de|clamers. In the camp of ALEXANDER, HE|PHESTIAN gave to EVIUS, the mu&s;ician, the quar|ters de&s;tined for EUMENES; who, thus affronted, complained to ALEXANDER, and &s;aid that he &s;aw
<PB N="78" REF="82">
plainly the be&s;t way to acquire promotion would be to throw away their arms and learn to play upon the flute, or turn tragedian.</P>
<P>Indeed, ALEXANDER, proud as he was, con|&s;idered it no degradation to countenance actors, and even to place a confidence in them. Having an opinion of the wit and readine&s;s, nay the di&s;cretion and honour of THESSALUS the actor, he &s;ent him on an emba&s;y to PEXODORUS, the Per&s;ian governor in CARIA, to break off a match between the elde&s;t daughter of that chief and ARIDAEUS.</P>
<P>At ALEXANDER's return to PHOENECIA from EGYPT, the people at the &s;acrifices were entertained with mu&s;ic, and dancing; and tragedies were al&s;o performed with the greate&s;t magnificence. Be&s;ides the per&s;ons u&s;ually cho&s;en by lot from the tribes to conduct tho&s;e exhibitions, NICOCREON, king of SALAMIS, and PASICRATES, king of SOLI, parti|cularly di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves upon this occa&s;ion. PASICRATES ri&s;ked the victory upon ATHENODORUS the actor, and NICOCREON upon THESSALUS. AL|EXANDER intere&s;ted him&s;elf mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly in be|half of the latter. He did not, however, le&s;t the a&s;&s;embly &s;hould be bia&s;&s;ed, declare in his favour till ATHENODORUS was proclaimed victor by all the &s;uffrages; when he exclaimed, that he com|mended
<PB N="79" REF="83">
the judges for what they had done, but that he would have given half his kingdom rather than have &s;een THESSALUS conquered.</P>
<P>ALEXANDER had an opportunity afterwards of &s;hewing how unprejudiced his mind was. When the &s;ame ATHENODORUS was fined by the Athenians, for not making his appearance on the &s;tage at the fea&s;ts of BACCHUS, he entreated ALEXANDER to intercede for him; who, though he did not cho&s;e to write in his favour, paid the fine.</P>
<P>Another time LYCON, the actor, a native of SCARPHIA, finding that his performance delighted ALEXANDER, in&s;inuated adroitly in his part, that he was in nece&s;&s;ity for ten talents. ALEXANDER laughed at the conceit, and ordered the actor what he &s;o ingeniou&s;ly demanded.</P>
<P>But the in&s;tances of admiration in which the talents and conduct of the Grecian actors were held are innumerable. We have already &s;een that AESCHYLUS, SOPHOCLES, and EURIPIDES, were all actors, and, indeed, &s;o were mo&s;t of the Grecian dramatic writers. Had not ARISTOPHANES been an excellent actor, the world would have lo&s;t the hateful character of CLEO.</P>
<P>Thus declamation at ATHENS was the criterion
<PB N="80" REF="84">
of oratory. POLUS, an actor, had lo&s;t his only, child, whom he tenderly loved, and he was on that day to perform a part which had an incident &s;imilar to his own &s;ituation. To render his grief more lively and natural, he took an urn containing the a&s;hes of his &s;on, which &s;o wrought upon his feel|ings that he drew tears from the whole a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, declamation was e&s;teemed a great re|qui&s;ite towards obtaining a rank in public life. The fir&s;t men of ATHENS did not di&s;dain to practi&s;e it. Neverthele&s;s actors were not permitted to judge of the merit of public entertainments.</P>
<P>When DEMOSTHENES complained that the wor&s;t orators were heard in the ro&s;trum in pre|ference to him, SATYRUS, the actor, to &s;hew him how much, grace, dignity, and action add to the celebrity of a public man, repeated to him &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages from SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES, with which DEMOSTHENES was &s;o captivated that he ever afterwards modelled his eloquence from the example of the be&s;t actors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We &s;hall &s;ee more of this when we get among the Romans.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have now &s;een that the dramatic art is traceable in GREECE to THESEUS<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">THESEUS, after he had de&s;erted ADRIADNE, in return for her having given him the clue to the labyrinth of CRETE, by which means he conquered the Minotaur, put in at DELOS, where he &s;a|crificed to APOLLO, fir&s;t having dedicated a &s;tatue of VENUS, which he had received as a pre&s;ent from ARIADNE. This ceremony, or dance, by various involutions and evolutions, re&s;embled the labyrinth, and was, therefore, called the Crane, in imitation of that bird, which, in its flight always takes a circular direction. THESEUS is &s;aid to have been &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that he in&s;tituted games at DELOS, where began the cu&s;tom of giving a palm to the victor.</NOTE>. That it gra|dually
<PB N="81" REF="85">
came forward till it was perfected by AESCHY|LUS; that the admirable talents of AESCHYLUS, SOPHOCLES, and EURIPIDES, were &s;uperior, when the infancy of the drama is con&s;idered, to any trium|virate &s;ince that time; that this great compact once broken, comedy, particularly in the hands of AR|ISTOPHANES, degenerated into licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and that the incomparable talents of MENANDER came too late to &s;ave the &s;inking intere&s;t of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>It remains now only to &s;ay, that from the paro|dies of the tragic writers, began by ARISTOPHANES, and awkwardly imitated by his cotemporaries and &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, &s;prung mimes, farces, and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t buffoonery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the Athentan theatre, by the introduction of puerili|ties, lo&s;t its honour, it lo&s;t its con&s;equence, and degenerated in credit as it degenerated in virtue.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. ROMAN THEATRE, FROM ITS ORIGIN TO THE TIME OF LIVIUS AN|DRONICUS.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT nature was to the Greeks the Greeks were to the Romans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, but by no means a&s;toni&s;hing, that the &s;ame may be &s;aid of all nations, in proportion as civilization extended it&s;elf: for we may go on and &s;ay that what the Greeks were to the French, the French were to us. It does not, however, follow that the dramatic art has gradually declined &s;ince the time of the Greeks; for the French improved upon the Romans, and we have, in great mea&s;ure, improved upon the French; but it follows, neverthele&s;s, that if AESCHYLUS, SOPHOCLES, EURIPIDES and MENANDER, had never been born, the theatre might at this moment have retained its original barbarity.</NOTE>, and the re&s;emblance is remarkably perfect; for, as the Greeks attained a &s;plendid degree of perfection by a clo&s;e imitation of nature, the Romans never arrived to any di&s;tingui&s;hed per|fection becau&s;e they imitated man. But, indeed, in greatne&s;s of &s;oul and &s;trength of mind they were in every thing infinitely below the Greeks. A peo|ple who&s;e luxury was to enjoy a &s;pectacle of gla|diators were little calculated to li&s;ten to lectures of
<PB N="84" REF="88">
truth and morality. The ferocious Romans were always rather terrible than great; and the mind ac|commodates it&s;elf ill to a belief that the &s;ame men could attend with any degree of plea&s;ure, or in|tere&s;t, to whatever inculcated the mild duties of clemency and beneficence; who, in cold blood, could murder their defencele&s;s &s;overeign at the foot of the capitol.</P>
<P>All writers agree that the Romans arrived to no degree of perfection in either literature or the arts, and, in particular, the &s;tage, but as they copied the Greeks, and that even of the &s;tage, their copies are faint indeed. The pompous and phlegmatic SENECA, fal&s;ely called the Tragic Poet, with his fettered and dependant &s;tyle, lagged far behind the Greek triumvirate. The cold TERENCE, though full of nature and grace, imprinted nothing on the mind congenial to the Roman character. The &s;ub|jects were Greek, but they were enfeebled and &s;piritle&s;s; and only &s;erved to excite regret in tho&s;e who knew how to ta&s;te the mu&s;e of MENANDER.</P>
<P>The Romans were nearly four hundred years without any &s;cenic repre&s;entations; but it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they were &s;o long without any &s;ort of poetry, or that &s;ome &s;elf-born amu&s;ement did not manife&s;t it&s;elf with them as it did with the Greeks;
<PB N="85" REF="89">
on the contrary mon&s;ters of this de&s;cription were born and nur&s;ed by fea&s;ts and debauches. Their fir&s;t poetry, which was called <HI>Saturnine</HI> and <HI>Fe&s;ci|nine</HI> was hard and crude, re&s;embling rather pro&s;e in cadence than mea&s;ured ver&s;e. In other re&s;pects it was full of gro&s;s raillery, and &s;ung by per&s;ons who accompanied it with ge&s;tures and po&s;tures the mo&s;t indecent and la&s;civious.</P>
<P>This barbarous &s;tuff gave place to raillery more refined; but which, however, became &s;o &s;evere and &s;arca&s;tic, that tho&s;e at whom it was levelled not liking the&s;e &s;ort of je&s;ts, retorted the kindne&s;s manually; till, at length, it cau&s;ed &s;o much mi&s;chief that a law was made which condemned to death any per&s;on who in their ver&s;es &s;hould wound the reputation of his neighbour. This law was made in the three hundred and &s;econd year of ROME; a certain proof that this licentiou&s;ne&s;s had obtained and that they had grown &s;ufficiently civilized at that time to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>This reform la&s;ted a hundred years, at the end of which time a public calamity induced them to &s;eize every opportunity to appea&s;e the anger of Heaven; and thus fea&s;ts in honour of the gods be|came, after a time, theatrical performances.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="90">The&s;e were, however, according to TITUS LIVY, irregular &s;ketches made up wholly of imitation. BALADINES, who came from TUSCANY, danced to the &s;ound of the flute, and exhibited a number of rude ge&s;tures and attitudes in the manner of that country. This amu&s;ement was received with the warme&s;t applau&s;e, and after repeated trials and im|provements it became more endurable. Regular troops named Hi&s;trions, becau&s;e in the Tu&s;can language a baladine is called Hi&s;ter, performed complete pieces entitled <HI>Satires,</HI> in which the ac|tors and the &s;pectators joined promi&s;cuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>The&s;e kind of farces continued about a hundred and twenty years; when the poet ANDRONICUS, about the time ARATUS called in ATICONOUS from MACEDONIA, which proved the ruin of GREECE, about two hundred and forty years after the death of AESCHYLUS, and about a hundred and eighty years after the death of SOPHOCLES and EURI|PIDES, brought forward the fir&s;t perfect dramatic piece in Rome.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. LIVIUS ANDRONICUS, PACUVIUS, ACCIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">LIVIUS ANDRONICUS, PACUVIUS, and ACCIUS, were the earlie&s;t poets in ROME. HOPACE gives to LIVIUS the reputation of invention, to PACUVIUS the merit of regularity, and to ACCIUS the advantage of &s;ublimity.</NOTE>, AND SENECA, AND THE PROGRESS OF TRAGEDY IN ROME.</HEAD>
<P>ANDRONICUS, &s;urnamed LIVIUS, becau&s;e he ob|tained his freedom through LIVIUS SALINATOR, to who&s;e children he was preceptor, was a native of GREECE. It is &s;aid, that, de&s;pairing of any im|provement in the Roman Theatre, he &s;ung his pieces in the manner of his predece&s;&s;ors; but one day as he was &s;urrounded by the populace, be|ing extremely fatigued, he called in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;lave, who relieved him while he fetched breath. The &s;lave, however, not acquitting him|&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of his ma&s;ter, he expo&s;tulated with him; upon this the &s;pectators, &s;uppo&s;ing their altercation to be a part of the piece, were &s;o en|tertained with it that from thence dialogue was adopted.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="92">It is much more probable that being him&s;elf a Greek, and having e&s;caped from the wreck of the Grecian theatre, LIVIUS bore away with him &s;uch part of its trea&s;ure as the &s;torm had &s;pared; and, as a fit opportunity for his purpo&s;e occurred at the end of the fir&s;t Punic war, when the Temple of JANUS was &s;hut for the &s;econd time &s;ince the foundation of ROME, and when the Romans were in friend&s;hip with all the world, he took his mea|&s;ures; and, in pity to the wretched &s;tate of their dra|ma, ventured to innovate upon a more rational ta&s;te.</P>
<P>This he did to &s;o good a purpo&s;e, that, certainly, for a time, the Romans rejected all their former rude and impure dramatic cu&s;toms; and, under the tuition of ANDRONICUS, determined to regulate their ta&s;te on the Grecian model; indeed it will be difficult to controvert, that through ANDRONICUS and ENNIUS, whom SUETONIUS tells us were half Greeks, the cau&s;e of literature at this favour|able period became completely e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Whatever the merit of ANDRONICUS might have been, except giving to Roman ta&s;te Grecian refinement, is very uncertain. He is &s;poken of in general only collaterally; and but for ENNIUS, with whom he is often coupled, and who, &s;ome tra|gedies tran&s;lated from the Greek excepted, has no
<PB N="89" REF="93">
right to be con&s;idered as a dramatic poet, we &s;hould know very little about his particular talents. 'Tis certain, however, that ANDRONICUS turned the tide of opinion for a time, but the Romans, ever changeable, at la&s;t grew tired of tragedy; which, having for &s;ome time undergone a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, was at la&s;t re&s;tored by PACUVIUS.</P>
<P>It is not exactly a&s;certained when PACUVIUS was born, but he flouri&s;hed, as a tragic poet in ROME, about &s;ixty years after ANDRONICUS fir&s;t began to be known; and, if it be true, what &s;ome contend, tragedy had &s;till a &s;mack of its parent &s;tock, for he is &s;aid to have been the grand&s;on of ENNIUS.</P>
<P>PACUVIUS, however, though he re&s;tored tra|gedy, as far as the fluctuating manners of the Ro|mans would admit, certainly did little more, for we know of nothing he produced of any celebrity; and, though he &s;ucce&s;sfuly kept, the Grecian ta&s;te afloat, and thus regulated the wild and extravagant &s;allies, which, in &s;pight of the be&s;t care pervaded the Roman &s;pectacles; yet, ACCIUS &s;eems to have reaped that harve&s;t of reputation which ANDRO|NICUS and PACUVIUS had &s;o carefully &s;own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PACUVIUS was properly by profe&s;&s;ion a painter; and we are informed that his productions, in this way, had con&s;iderable merit.

<P><PB N="90" REF="94">ACCIUS was born in the five hundred and eighty-third year of ROME.

<P>What, however, &s;eems to have given ACCIUS more reputation and con&s;equence than any thing el&s;e, was the ver&s;es he wrote in prai&s;e of DECIMUS BRUTUS, who was honoured with a triumph for his victories in SPAIN; and, who was &s;o charmed upon this occa&s;ion with ACCIUS, that he had the ver&s;es in|&s;cribed at the entrances of tho&s;e temples which he cau&s;ed to be erected out of the &s;poils of the van|qui&s;hed; and thus we have BRUTUS's word, &s;o flattered, that ACCIUS was an excellent poet.</P>
<P>As ACCIUS pa&s;&s;ed through Tarentum, in his way
<PB N="91" REF="95">
to ASIA, he paid a vi&s;it to PACUVIUS, and read to him his tragedy of <HI>Atreus,</HI> which, by the advice of his old ma&s;ter, he had copied from the Greek. PA|CUVIUS told him that his &s;tyle was elevated, but that it was rude. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I dont blu&s;h at that,"</Q> &s;aid ACCIUS,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it will teach me to write better hereafter; for it is with genius as it is with fruit. Apples that are at fir&s;t four become &s;weet as they ripen, while tho&s;e which are un&s;ea&s;onably &s;oft and di&s;coloured rot before they come to maturity."</Q></P>
<P>Certainly ACCIUS has been cen&s;ured for writing har&s;h and crude, but in other re&s;pects he was al|lowed to have had con&s;iderable merit. He was held in &s;uch re&s;pect that an actor was puni&s;hed for only mentioning his name on the &s;tage, and VA|LERIUS MAXIMUS tells us, that when JULIUS CAESAR entered the a&s;&s;embly of poets ACCIUS never paid him the homage of ri&s;ing to receive him; not that he meant to fail in re&s;pect, but be|cau&s;e he con&s;idered that the &s;uperiority lay on the &s;ide of literature; and becau&s;e, in &s;uch an a&s;|&s;embly, the que&s;tion was not who&s;e title was the mo&s;t illu&s;trious but who was the be&s;t writer.</P>
<P>ACCIUS was a&s;ked why he who knew &s;o well how to enforce &s;entiment and eloquence in his tra|gedies did not plead. <Q REND="inline">"Becau&s;e," &s;aid he, "at
<PB N="92" REF="96">
the theatre I make them &s;ay what I plea&s;e, at the bar my adver&s;aries would &s;ay what I &s;hould di&s;like."</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;um up PACUVIUS and ACCIUS in the words of QUINTILIAN; who &s;ays that tho&s;e il|lu&s;trious authors united in their tragedies, greatne&s;s of thought, and energy of &s;tyle; and, for the re&s;t, if they have not expanded more grace through their works, and carried them to a higher degree of perfection, the fault was in the time when they wrote and not in them.</P>
<P>It is not at this moment decided whether the be&s;t Roman tragedies, which are attributed to an author of the name of SENECA, are written by SENECA, the philo&s;opher, or him, who for di&s;|tinction, is called SENECA the Tragic Poet. JUSTUS LIPSIUS, and ERASMUS, give it in favour of the philo&s;opher. ENNIUS, however, in&s;i&s;ts that he wrote only the fir&s;t four, his brother, the tragic poet, three, and that the other three are written by three different authors; but this di&s;pute has given ri&s;e to a hundred conjectures, till, at length, ga|thering as it has gone, FATHER BRUMOY will have it that neither of the SENECAS had any hand in the&s;e pieces, but that they were written by an anonymous author, who concealed his own name to &s;ub&s;titute one much more celebrated in literature.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="97">The probability is, that they had both a con|cern in them. All the biographers of SENECA, the philo&s;opher, agree that he wrote four tragedies; the&s;e his brother might have fathered, and he might al&s;o have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the compo&s;ition of the rest; but the other, being occupied in &s;tudies of a more &s;ublime nature, he might have conceived it improper to enter the li&s;ts on a &s;ubject that would not only have enticed him from his other pur&s;uits, but have involved him in inconvenient con|trover&s;ies.</P>
<P>Leaving this point, however, as it ever will remain undecided, let us examine the tragedies them &s;elves; which, though they were in places heavy, turgid, and inflated, have many true beau|ties; proving that if ta&s;te was &s;acrificed in them, it was as in others, a &s;acrifice to the times.</P>
<P>NERO, who&s;e ridiculous preten&s;ions to works of merit, were as vain as his genius was contempti|ble, gave a mon&s;trous and fanta&s;tic air to all objects around him. The poets took the &s;ame tone, and SENECA was obliged to conform. Again. The extravagance and fal&s;e dignity with which pieces were at that time repre&s;ented to impo&s;e upon the people. The &s;ubject was always taken from re|ligion; gods were brought on the &s;tage; and it was
<PB N="94" REF="98">
impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;ert too much bomba&s;t in their ex|pre&s;&s;ions. The eclat introduced into the mu&s;ic of the chorus, the marvellous magnificence of the &s;cenes, all, to be of a piece, went prodigiou&s;ly be|yond nature.</P>
<P>It was nece&s;&s;ary in every way to &s;trike the pub|lic with a&s;toni&s;hment. In proportion as the thea|tres were enlarged, &s;o they enlarged the figures of the actors. They walked upon &s;tilts, they u&s;ed a porte-voice, and covered their faces with ma&s;ques which re&s;embled tho&s;e characters they repre&s;ented. All this was nece&s;&s;ary to delude a nation who panted to turn now and then from the horrible pic|tures pre&s;ented every day to their &s;ight by that un|natural and in&s;atiable mon&s;ter their &s;overeign; who not content with de&s;troying an infinite number of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious citizens of ROME, conniving at poi&s;oning his father, attempting to drown his mo|ther, and a&s;&s;a&s;inating his wife and his brother, to heap up the mea&s;ure of his abominable crimes, &s;acrificed the very man whom he had compelled to throw this veil over the eyes of his &s;ubjects, that they might be diverted from the ju&s;t and equita|ble revenge which at length, to &s;ave their &s;ink|ing honour, became the reward of his ignorant pride, his de&s;picable cowardice, and his diabolical cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="99">NERO incorporated the natural cruelty of his character with the artificial &s;ubjects on the &s;tage. If a poet would write a piece to plea&s;e him it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;hed too much blood. This mon&s;trous mixture of barbarity and love for theatrical re|pre&s;entations carried him to the mo&s;t extravagant lengths. He in&s;tituted the fea&s;ts Juvenalia, which were celebrated in honour of his mother, at the very moment that he meditated her de&s;truction. The pomp introduced in the&s;e is inconceivable. Nothing could go beyond the parade except the vanity with which he expo&s;ed his incorrigible folly. Among the re&s;t he offered the produce of his chin, when he was &s;haved for the fir&s;t time, to JUPITER CAPITO|LINUS. He obliged per&s;ons of the fir&s;t di&s;|tinction to perform different parts. He him&s;elf &s;ung the fable of <HI>Atis,</HI> and the <HI>Bacchantes,</HI> while BURRHUS and SENECA were commanded to ex|cite the &s;pectarors to applaud.</P>
<P>SUETONIUS informs, us, that when NERO per|formed on the &s;tage, he filled his hair with golden powder to re&s;emble APOLLO; and while he &s;ung and accompanied him&s;elf with the lyre, the &s;ol|diers with the point of the &s;word extorted ap|plau&s;e from the people.</P>
<P>All this &s;erves to induce a belief that however, the &s;toical au&s;terity and gravity of SENECA might
<PB N="96" REF="100">
incline him to be &s;ilent as to the hand he had in tho&s;e tragedies, they were either written or con|nived at by him; and that whatever there is ami&s;s in them he was compelled to admit, and whatever ex|cellent &s;prung from his own genius.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed that they contained, in places, &s;ome mo&s;t admirable morality. In the choru&s;es, in particular, there are brilliant &s;entences, filled with &s;uperb images, and expre&s;&s;ed in beautiful ver&s;e. Upon the whole, though taken altogether, they can|not &s;erve as patterns for dramatic writing; though the admirers of the great &s;toic philo&s;opher, may feel there being attributed to him as degrading to the me|mory of their favourite; yet, with all their faults, and with all his high reputation, they contain, clogged, perhaps, and fettered with unworthy and di&s;graceful pa&s;&s;ages impelled by the glare of a tyrant's fal|chion, &s;entiments which might legitimately emanate from the &s;oul of SENECA.</P>
<P>There were other tragic poets among the Ro|mans, but we know very little of them. MARCUS ATTILIUS wrote tragedies, but his &s;tyle was bar|barous, for &s;o CICERO tells us, and LUCINIUS calls him the Iron Poet.</P>
<P>PUBLIUS POMPONIUS, who was the relation and intimate friend of PLINY, wrote tragedies at
<PB N="97" REF="101">
the time of the emperor CLAUDIUS who very much admired them. PUBLIUS &s;eems to have written with a more independant &s;pirit than SENECA; for, FABIUS &s;ays, that being de&s;ired by the emperor to take certain pa&s;&s;ages out of his pieces, he an|&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">"I &s;hall appeal to the people."</Q> He was not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed in the army than on the the|atre; for TACITUS tells us, that he was once re|warded with the honour of a triumph.</P>
<P>SULPITIUS is &s;poken of as an author of merit CICERO calls him the tragic orator. STRABO &s;peaks of DIODORUS of Alexandria, who acquired con|&s;iderable reputation in his tragedies. ATHENAEUS tells us of LEONTINE, OVID of TURANIUS, AC|RON of ARISTIUS FUSCUS, and PROPERTIUS of PONTHICUS; but, indeed, there was &s;carcely an eminent man among the Romans but had &s;omething to do with the theatre. The ancient grammarians have given an account of the <HI>Thye&s;tus</HI> of GRAC|CHUS, the <HI>Alcmeon</HI> of CATULLUS, the <HI>Adra&s;tus</HI> of CAESAR, the <HI>Ajax</HI> of AUGUSTUS, the <HI>Octavio</HI> of MAECENAS, and the <HI>Medea</HI> of OVID; but they &s;ay that the&s;e tragedies are all lo&s;t, and that the lo&s;s is not worthy to be regretted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. PLAUTUS AND TERENCE, AND THE PROGRESS OF COMEDY IN ROME.</HEAD>
<P>TO this moment, perhaps, comedy has not been critically defined. It is not the ancient, or the comedy of PHRYNICHUS and his followers, becau&s;e there is &s;omething &s;hockingly revolting in holding up men by their names and proclaiming their vices and follies to the world, and comedy ought not to revolt an audience. It is not the middle, or the comedy of ARISTOPHANES and his followers, be|cau&s;e, though the man is not named, if he be not &s;o repre&s;ented as to be known to all the world, the audience cannot be &s;atisfied; if he be &s;o known, they mu&s;t be &s;hocked on the &s;ide of humanity, and comedy ought not to excite either of the&s;e con&s;e|quences. It cannot be the new, or the comedy of MENANDER and his followers, becau&s;e, though in this &s;pecies of comedy both names and circum|&s;tances are feigned, yet the licence is &s;o wide and diffu&s;ive, that there is &s;carcely any province in the
<PB N="99" REF="103">
whole circle of the drama that it might not em|brace, and comedy &s;hould neither &s;oar nor de|generate.</P>
<P>Comedy appears then to be the e&s;&s;ence of ME|NANDER's plan applied by an ingenious poet to man|ners, time, and place; and &s;o managed as to repre|&s;ent common life &s;o exact, &s;o animated, and &s;o faith|ful, that the author, the actors, and the &s;pectators, may go away &s;atisfied with one another. Not a portrait, but a picture; not the likene&s;s of an individual, but a re&s;emblance of the whole audience; nay, of the whole world, of human nature. Every thing above this trenches upon tragedy, every thing below it &s;inks into farce.</P>
<P>Merely to laugh and to cry, is to indulge two emotions of the mind derived from the &s;ame origin, and which have &s;o very little to do with the heart that one is not always a &s;ign of joy, nor the other of grief. When I &s;ee a character put into all &s;ituations but tho&s;e which are natural to it, I think of a groom exerci&s;ing a managed hor&s;e; and after be|coming fatigued with his bounds, his leaps, and his caprioles, I long to &s;ee him walk. In &s;hort let no poet expect to produce a real comedy who cannot excite every emotion of the &s;oul without unworthily
<PB N="100" REF="104">
&s;urpri&s;ing the heart, or reproaching the under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>If this be any thing like the true definition of comedy, we mu&s;t de&s;pair of finding it in any re|pute among the Romans; for TERENCE came very far &s;hort of it in one re&s;pect, and PLAUTUS went very far beyond it in the other; and as to any comic writers but tho&s;e, what did they produce but pityful farce, and contemptible buffoonery.</P>
<P>Comedy, in ROME, did not e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf &s;y&s;te|matically and by degrees as it did in GREECE; for PLAUTUS wrote for the theatre during the time of LIVIUS ANDRONICUS, and TERENCE, who was nine years old when PLAUTUS died, mu&s;t of cour&s;e have been cotemporary with PACUVIUS and ACCIUS; &s;o that every thing &s;erious and comic, good and bad, came at once; and &s;o it was but Grecian, found a kind welcome among the Romans. On this account their theatre adopted indi&s;criminately every &s;pecies of dramatic amu&s;e|ment, from the loftie&s;t tragedy to the mo&s;t mi&s;erable farce, and that which was ab&s;urde&s;t was the mo&s;t admired.</P>
<P>Had the ta&s;te of the Romans admitted of re|gularity, PLAUTUS and TERENCE might certainly
<PB N="101" REF="105">
have gone a great way towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a cri|terion for comedy; but PLAUTUS, in compliance with the times, pro&s;tituted that real wit which he certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which, properly and re&s;o|lutely exerci&s;ed, might have &s;hamed the people out of tho&s;e mon&s;trous &s;atires and gro&s;s farces, which di&s;graced the &s;tage; and TERENCE, determined upon a reform, went to the other extreme and ex|hibited, as an object of public admiration, a mu&s;e, correct indeed, in perfect proportion, mea&s;ured and compa&s;&s;ed to a nicety; but which wanted warmth, animation, and &s;pirit; &s;erious without intere&s;t, good without a motive, and virtuous without in|ducement.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid that the impures of TERENCE &s;poke more mode&s;tly than the hone&s;t women of PLAUTUS; therefore both were out of place. It mu&s;t he al|lowed, however, that the prai&s;e of the candid and the &s;en&s;ible is eminently due to both the&s;e poets; but the manners were too corrupt for any rea&s;onable hope of reformation. The ta&s;k was Herculean; and if ARISTOPHANES, who laid about him &s;oundly, &s;paring neither friend nor foe, could work no reform in poli&s;hed GREECE, but on the contrary much mi&s;chief, how &s;hould PLAUTUS, without the &s;ame club, or the &s;trength to wield it, expect a reform in barbarous ROME; and if MENANDER, with the
<PB N="102" REF="106">
grace of eloquence, the purity of rea&s;on, and the beauty of truth, could make no impre&s;&s;ion on re|creant minds, once accu&s;tomed to love virtue, how &s;hould TERENCE hope that cions from the&s;e exo|tics, which had drooped and died at home, &s;hould flouri&s;h into &s;trength and beauty in an uncongenial foil.</P>
<P>PLAUTUS has been warmly prai&s;ed and &s;everely cen&s;ured. VARRO &s;ays, that if the Mu&s;es were to &s;peak Latin they would certainly &s;peak in the lan|guage of PLAUTUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a trite idea and has been twenty times applied, and in particular by SOCRATES, who &s;aid, and I own the re&s;emblance &s;eems to be more perfect, that if JUPITER conde&s;cended to &s;peak like man he would &s;peak the language of PLATO; but as to the Mu&s;es VARRO, &s;peaking of PLAUTUS, pays no great compliment to tho&s;e ladies when we recollect what we were told ju&s;t now of the language of his mode&s;t women.</NOTE>. It is the opinion of CICERO, GELLIUS, MACROBIUS, LIPSIUS, and others, that his genuine ridicule, the truth of his characters, the plea&s;antry and poignancy of his wit, and the force of his &s;atire, have &s;et him far beyond all the other Roman comic writers. On the contrary, another troop of critics, headed by HORACE, cen&s;ure his wit in the &s;evere&s;t terms, as unintelligible, gro&s;s, ob|&s;cene, and void of that beauty and truth &s;o e&s;&s;ential in the compo&s;ition of comedy.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="107">PLAUTUS, not being able to do what he wi&s;hed, did what he could. 'Tis a con&s;tant, but lamentable excu&s;e, to &s;ay all this mu&s;t be done to comply with the ta&s;te of the times. In this ca&s;e an author does not write for the in&s;truction of the world, the world in&s;truct him what to write. PLAUTUS thus tired out, very &s;oon, by the bye, of in&s;tructing others, was willing enough to take the&s;e in&s;tructions him&s;elf, preferring profit to fame; for which poetic &s;in he is &s;aid to have been &s;everely puni&s;hed; for, being a covetous man, after he had ama&s;&s;ed a fortune by his works, he became a bankrupt, and worked as a jour|neyman miller to procure him&s;elf a &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>As to TERENCE, though PLAUTUS had cer|tainly a &s;tronger genius, and a more fervid imagina|tion, he will long continue to live in the knowledge and e&s;timation of all nations with a certain and decided reputation; and yet it is a reputation that does not excite much envy. It is in vain to deny that without MENANDER there could have been no TERENCE; but yet MENANDER having written plays on a plan which expo&s;ed vice without expo&s;ing individuals, having attempted to &s;implify comedy in GREECE as AESCHYLUS had &s;implified tragedy; the good &s;en&s;e of TERENCE in pre&s;erving this trea&s;ure which he had the fortune to find, and the mode&s;ty to give to the world as free from alloy as po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="104" REF="108">
cannot be enough commended; and it is not becau&s;e he has laboured to tran&s;mit to po&s;terity the reputation of MENANDER that we mu&s;t deny reputation to him.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that though HOMER ought mo&s;t to be admired, VIRGIL ought mo&s;t to be copied, for, though VIRGIL is an imitator of HOMER, yet the &s;tyle of VIRGIL will ever beget him a higher degree of literary reputation; and yet who would not, after all this, rather be HOMER than VIRGIL? And &s;o of TERENCE; his dialogue is full of beauty, poli&s;h, and regularity; his characters are natural, exact, and fini&s;hed; and his conduct cha&s;te, proper, and decorous; but he has no variety, his plots have a tire&s;ome &s;amene&s;s, and his &s;cene and his characters have nothing to do with one another; all which forces his very admirers to remark that he is only perfect as far as he goes. The fact is, that every thing in TERENCE is Greek except the language.</P>
<P>On the other hand, as TERENCE was not original like MENANDER, and had not the genius, the wit and the fire of MENANDER, though his &s;tyle, and the merit of having conveyed the re&s;emblance of that admirable poet to po&s;terity, will be gratefully acknowledged by every admirer of diligent indu&s;try; yet I would rather be MENANDER with all his
<PB N="105" REF="109">
obligations to TERENCE, than TERENCE with all his obligations to MENANDER.</P>
<P>The di&s;tinction between PLAUTUS and TE|RENCE &s;eems to be this. PLAUTUS gave an un|bridled licence to his wit, TERENCE curbed his too tightly; cen&s;urable this in either ca&s;e. CAESAR wi&s;hes that TERENCE had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the <HI>vis comica</HI> of PLAUTUS, and yet he acknowledges that it was indelicate and coar&s;e. QUINTILIAN, PATER|CULLUS, and others of the ancients have wi&s;hed PLAUTUS to have had the urbanity and purity of TERENCE, which ERASMUS &s;ays may be con&s;idered as a criterion of the Latin language, and yet this urbanity is allowed to be cold and tame.</P>
<P>Both Engli&s;h and French critics, &s;upporting their opinions by ancient authorities, have written as oppo&s;itely on this &s;ubject as fro&s;t is to fire; &s;ome maintaining that PLAUTUS is neglected, for that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite of a fir&s;t rate dramatic genius; others that he is a mi&s;erable farce-writer, and beneath contempt or critici&s;m; and, as to TERENCE, &s;carcely have you &s;hut up one au|thority by which you learn that no true beauty or refined elegance can go beyond him, but you open another where he is &s;aid to have been &s;o dull, that
<PB N="106" REF="110">
there are but two pa&s;&s;ages in his &s;ix plays that &s;tand the &s;malle&s;t chance of provoking a &s;mile.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice, therefore, I think, will take a middle cour&s;e, and incline us to believe that though the reputation of PLAUTUS and TERENCE, as imitators of ARISTOPHANES and MENANDER, may admit of a con&s;iderable deduction; yet had they not been fettered by the fal&s;e ta&s;te of that country in which they wrote, and which would admit of no innovation but what was Greek, they might, from their own in|trin&s;ic merit, have e&s;tabli&s;hed a much more brilliant reputation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. FARCES, PANTOMIMES, AND OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>OF ROME, where the dramatic art did not come forward in its natural gradation, but where a ta&s;te for tragedy, comedy, farce, pantomime, &s;atire, ma&s;que, tragic-comedy, and every thing regular and irregular prevailed, ju&s;t as whim or caprice governed the moment, it is difficult to give a di|ge&s;ted account of the &s;tage.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that gro&s;s &s;atires and buffoonery originally prevailed, and that the&s;e &s;atires and this buffoonery were born from drunken fea&s;ts, and, therefore, full of indecency and licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and that after a time they a&s;&s;umed the form of invectives of a mo&s;t vehement kind again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ed vices of particular per&s;ons. In this &s;tate we have &s;een them prohibited; but their &s;pirit, however, was never lo&s;t, for in proportion as they were admitted by different legi&s;lators, &s;o they were, at different
<PB N="108" REF="112">
times, the leading favourites of the people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be here material to notice that the &s;atires of the Greeks differed e&s;&s;entially from tho&s;e of the Romans, though both may be denominated farce; a &s;pecies of dramatic entertainment no doubt antecedent to all others. The &s;atires, or farces, of the Greeks, were little pieces admitting of either tragic or comic &s;ubjects treated in the way of burle&s;que. Tho&s;e of the Romans were poems mingled with bitter invectives again&s;t vice. The objection again&s;t both is that they were impure and indecent to a mon&s;trous degree; for while the Grecians, to relieve their tragedies, than which nothing can be more cha&s;te and pure, introduced mobs of drunken &s;atyrs, whence the title of the&s;e pieces, the Romans expo&s;ed, without mincing the matter, by la&s;civious and ob&s;cene de&s;criptions and attitudes, tho&s;e vices they af|fected to hold up to public &s;corn; nay we are told, by way of a very curious remedy again&s;t vice, which to a degree horrid and compli|cate no people ever encouraged &s;o much as the Romans, that ac|tre&s;&s;es were expo&s;ed naked, after the piece was over, to do away any impre&s;&s;ion the Roman youths might have received from tho&s;e charms which had been veiled from their &s;ight.</NOTE>, to the rejection, at intervals, of the works of tho&s;e poets who had, as we have &s;een, laboured with &s;o much indu&s;try, and to &s;o little purpo&s;e to amend a bad ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Pantomimes were al&s;o, at times, prodigiou&s;ly followed. The&s;e flouri&s;hed in ROME during the reign of AUGUSTUS. Some &s;ay they originated at that time, but this is not the truth; for there can be no doubt but they were antecedent even to the
<PB N="109" REF="113">
Grecian Chorus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be proved in its place that not only pantomime is more than three thou&s;and years old, indeed one in&s;tance has already been given in THESEUS's dance of <HI>The Crane,</HI> but that opera, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had exi&s;tence only two hundred years, is an im|provement of the ancient chorus.</NOTE>. They were introduced at ROME by PYLADES and BATHYLLUS. PYLADES was celebrated for &s;erious &s;ubjects, and BATHYLLUS for comic.</P>
<P>What we are told of the&s;e pantomimes is beyond mea&s;ure a&s;toni&s;hing. SENECA confe&s;&s;es he had a real ta&s;te and pa&s;&s;ion for them. LUCIAN tells us, that though mute and una&s;&s;i&s;ted by either poetry or mu&s;ic, they were as affecting as the tragedies and comedies of their be&s;t writers; but as pantomimes, the only part of the drama in which the Romans im|proved on the Greeks, were the la&s;t and mo&s;t &s;e|rious innovation, and as they led to all tho&s;e factions and di&s;&s;entions, &s;truggling with which the theatre received its death wound, they &s;hall re&s;t till we have &s;een in what manner poor tragedy and comedy were to&s;&s;ed about in that agitated &s;ea of &s;welling, broken, and jarring intere&s;ts, the Roman theatre.</P>
<P>Soon after regular pieces were introduced, &s;a|tires were neglected, and continued to be &s;o during the time the poets them&s;elves performed in their
<PB N="110" REF="114">
own dramas. But the youths of ROME, tired of tragedies, at length took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the theatre, where they performed &s;atires by way of interlude, in the place of the chorus. To conciliate al&s;o the &s;uff|rages of the Romans for this innovation on dramatic regularity, they produced pieces in imitation of the Greek &s;atires, which were partly &s;erious and partly comic.</P>
<P>To &s;uch a pitch was this carried, that the com|mon people, who reli&s;hed nothing but gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and buffoonery, in the mid&s;t of the regular performances were continually calling for athletic feats, tumbling, and bear dancing. One of the comedies of TE|RENCE is &s;aid to have been thus interrupted &s;everal times during the two fir&s;t repre&s;entations, and the performers were obliged to quit the theatre, to make place for rope-dancers and gladiators; for, had this not been complied with, a further repre|&s;entation of the comedy would never have been permitted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">VOLTAIRE &s;ays that in England every thing is mob.

<P><PB N="111" REF="115">The tragi-comedies, however, in a great mea|&s;ure reconciled this; and as the performers were freed men, the citizens con&s;idered them in as re|&s;pectable a light as the poets. Thus an amne&s;ty was at length agreed on, the chorus was permitted in its place, and they were contented to perform the &s;atires by way of after-pieces.</P>
<P>Before the time of SCIPIO, the African&mdash;who &s;ome believe to have had a hand, together with LELIUS his friend, in the comedies of TERENCE&mdash;the &s;enators and the Roman knights a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the &s;pectacles promi&s;cuou&s;ly with the plebeians: the only di&s;tinction paid to the patricians was, the ple|beians were obliged to find every thing in prepara|tion for them. Afterwards, however, there was a con&s;iderable difference made between them, and it was from this time that the theatres grew into regu|larity, which ended in the building of amphitheatres in a &s;tyle prodigiou&s;ly large and a&s;toni&s;hingly mag|nificent. In the amphitheatre built by JULIUS CAESAR we are told that a hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons could be commodiou&s;ly &s;eated. In the&s;e buildings were placed orche&s;tras where the &s;enators &s;at; and, in a di&s;tingui&s;hed eminence, the emperor and his family: the patricians had al&s;o places &s;et apart for them, and the plebeians occupied the remaining &s;pace.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="116">AUGUSTUS added a &s;uperb covering of purple to the theatre for the convenience of the &s;pectators: he al&s;o built porticos; and finding that JULIUS CAESAR had lo&s;t &s;ome of his popularity by not pay|ing that attention to their amu&s;ement expected by the public, he him&s;elf made it his &s;tudy to apply very clo&s;ely to whatever could engage their intere&s;t through the medium of promoting their plea&s;ures. He was very exact in his attendance at the theatre; and when indi&s;po&s;ition, or affairs of &s;tate prevented his per&s;onal appearance, he never failed to &s;end &s;ome of his family to repre&s;ent him and make his excu&s;es to the people. In this manner, mingling policy with their enjoyments, he in&s;inuated him&s;elf with greater certainty into their affections, and carried all his points &s;o well by this ingenious and &s;en&s;ible conduct, that he never found it difficult to broach mea&s;ures which, had they been introduced in a mode le&s;s enticing, might have been con&s;idered as dangerous novelties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Being one day told of this, AUGUSTUS an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'it is right to admini&s;ter to the people's folly that their attention may be diverted from things of con&s;equence.'</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Romans had in their entertainments the mo&s;t &s;uperb machines, in &s;ome of which chariots traver&s;ed the theatre; in others gods de&s;cended
<PB N="113" REF="117">
through the roof; and a third &s;ort were &s;o con&s;tructed &s;o as to &s;upport characters which appeared to be flying. On the&s;e they ventured &s;o much at hazard, that many dreadful accidents befel them. We are told in SUETONIUS that an actor who was perform|ing the part of <HI>Icarus,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of NERO, &s;o exerted him&s;elf that though he fabled the charac|ter, he reali&s;ed the cata&s;trophe; for falling from a prodigious height, he was da&s;hed to pieces, and the emperor was covered with his blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To give at once an idea of the incredible magnificence of the Roman &s;tage. The &s;cene alone in the theatre of MARCUS SCAURUS was ornamented with three hundred and &s;ixty columns and three thou&s;and &s;tatues.</NOTE></P>
<P>Among the Romans it was very frequently the cu&s;tom for two actors to perform the &s;ame part in conjunction, that is to &s;ay, one &s;poke and another acted. The following circum&s;tance is &s;aid to have given ri&s;e to it.</P>
<P>LIVIUS ANDRONICUS, who has been already mentioned as the fir&s;t regular poet, and who per|formed in his own pieces, gave the audience &s;uch &s;atisfaction that they frequently obliged him to re|peat the mo&s;t plea&s;ing pa&s;&s;ages. One day he was encored &s;o often that, by mere dint of exertion, he became extremely hoar&s;e. Rather than fail of their
<PB N="114" REF="118">
entertainment, the audience made another actor re|cite the words, and entreated ANDRONICUS to &s;up|ply the action. This he did &s;o much to their con|tent, that they immediately adopted this mode as an improvement on their former plan; for, having now nothing to attend to but the action, they found that the performer was much more animated; which, it will be &s;een, was extremely nece&s;&s;ary when we con&s;ider how va&s;t their theatres were, that they performed in ma&s;ks, and that the movement of their mouths and mu&s;cles could not be &s;o accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed as to a&s;certain whether they &s;poke or not.</P>
<P>When this cu&s;tom came to be more perfect, a &s;inger was cho&s;en who&s;e voice had the neare&s;t re&s;emblance to that of the actor. This &s;inger was placed in a convenient &s;ituation towards the back of the &s;tage. He always &s;poke in a certain mea&s;ure regulated upon fixed mu&s;ical principles, which mea&s;ure al&s;o regulated the ge&s;ticulation and deportment of the actor. In addition to this, when &s;everal performers &s;ung together, a man with iron &s;hoes beat time with his feet, which could not fail to be heard by all tho&s;e who bore a part.</P>
<P>This extravagant propen&s;ity for action intro|duced, as we have &s;een, pantomimes. The&s;e were found, however, alarming and dangerous. The ex|treme
<PB N="115" REF="119">
pa&s;&s;ion the people had for the&s;e &s;ort of enter|tainments gave ri&s;e to cabals, and cabals begat fac|tions.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. ACTORS, AND THE CONCLUSION OF THE ROMAN THEATRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE manner in which the Romans paid attention to any thing was of &s;o rude a kind, that the compli|ment was &s;eldom either an honour, or an advantage; whereas the Greeks knew how to render a di&s;tinction more welcome by the mode of conferring it. It is on this account, perhaps, we have been told that the profe&s;&s;ion of an actor was di&s;reputable at ROME, though honourable in GREECE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A French author, &s;peaking of this circum&s;tance, &s;ays, that, in regard to actors, FRANCE imitates both GREECE and ROME; for that the French con&s;ider actors after the manner of the Romans, and live among them after the manner of the Greeks.</NOTE>, for there is no|thing el&s;e that &s;eems to lend probability to this report.</P>
<P>The actors in ROME were freed men, and en|joyed all the immunities of other citizens; but there were two circum&s;tances which &s;eemed to place them differently in rank to the actors in GREECE. In GREECE, the be&s;t authors were the be&s;t actors,
<PB N="117" REF="121">
and they were be&s;ides, as we have &s;een, very ho|nourably employed; whereas few of the Roman authors were actors; and, except in one or two in|&s;tances, nothing can be &s;aid of their rank, for PLAUTUS was a miller's man, and TERENCE was a &s;lave<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is no deduction from their merit, but rather an honoura|ble tribute to it. It is only mentioned here to &s;hew that men of ge|nius in &s;ociety are care&s;&s;ed from appearance only, ju&s;t as a book is e&s;timated by the gaudine&s;s of its binding. The mind of the man, and the contents of the book being con&s;idered as matters of no con&s;equence.</NOTE>. The other circum&s;tance is, that though men of high rank and con&s;iderable employment, from ediles to emperors, were actors, yet they were not profe&s;&s;ionally &s;o, but in the nature of amateurs; and on this account they could not have kept up their di&s;tinction off the &s;tage had they not affected to look down on tho&s;e, without who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they would have cut a de&s;picable figure on it.</P>
<P>Thus acting in ROME was a profe&s;&s;ion by it&s;elf; and it is on this account, probably, it grew into &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing repute. In GREECE it was no un|common thing for authors to teach actors their man|ner; to note, mea&s;ure, and point the cadence, that the actors might be tutored into reciting and &s;inging, as regularly as boys are in a cathedral. In ROME
<PB N="118" REF="122">
all this was unnece&s;&s;ary; actors, as to repre&s;entation, could teach authors.</P>
<P>What a&s;toni&s;hing things we are told of AESOP and ROSCIUS, who were preceptors in eloquence, AESOP in particular, to CICERO. The action of this great man, like that of DEMOSTHENES, was de|fective, 'till with unwearied attention he had &s;tudied under the&s;e actors; from whom he imbibed &s;uch commanding powers of attracting and per&s;uading his hearers by the force of his ge&s;ture, the modu|lation of his voice, and the grace of his action, as to be acknowledged the greate&s;t orator of an|tiquity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There cannot be a doubt but AESOP and ROSCIUS in their in&s;tructions to CICERO, laid the foundation of all tho&s;e extraneous and &s;portive &s;allies of humour, through which, at this moment, the lives and property of individuals are eloquently je&s;ted away, for it mu&s;t be allowed that there was much &s;tage wit, and many clap-traps in the oratory of CICERO.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AESOP performed tragedy, and ROSCIUS come|dy; therefore, ju&s;t as we &s;ay tragedy and comedy, or GREECE and ROME, giving the ancient title the fir&s;t di&s;tinction, &s;o we &s;ay AESOP and ROSCIUS, but there can be no doubt but ROSCIUS had more uni|ver&s;al merit than AESOP. Of this his rendering CICERO's oration not only perfectly intelligible
<PB N="119" REF="123">
but greatly intere&s;ting by ge&s;ture alone is a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing proof. His judgment is &s;poken of in terms of wonder. He taught acting to all ranks, by which he ama&s;&s;ed prodigious riches, and never failed at fir&s;t &s;ight to predict the degree of progre&s;s his &s;cholar would make. He had &s;uch &s;trength of mind, and &s;uch acute perception, that he penetrated the very rece&s;&s;es of the heart. No wonder &s;uch a man &s;hould command the pa&s;&s;ions of his audience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ROSCIUS &s;eems, in his way, to have been a LAVATER, yet &s;o good an actor that had he a&s;&s;umed in LAVATER's pre&s;ence a character totally different from his own, he would certainly have created a blemi&s;h in the infallibility of the phi&s;iognomi&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ROSCIUS certainly was immen&s;ely rich. His &s;alary was equal to three thou&s;and pounds a year; and as he performed very late in life, as he made incredible &s;ums by teaching, and as he had led a pretty regular life, a few freaks with SYLLA and others excepted, by which he was rather likely to gain than to lo&s;e, by the time he arrived to eighty-one, at which age he died, he mu&s;t have realized a mon&s;trous &s;um.</P>
<P>All the great men, who were cotemporary with ROSCIUS and &s;urvived him, pay the mo&s;t enthu|&s;ia&s;tic tributes of love and e&s;teem to his memory. CICERO regreted him mo&s;t &s;ervently. <Q REND="inline">"Where,"</Q>
<PB N="120" REF="124">
&s;aid he, in one of his mo&s;t celebrated orations,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is the man among us who has &s;o hardened a mind, and &s;o unfeeling a heart, as not to be deeply af|fected at the death of ROSCIUS!"</Q>
CATULLUS compares his form, with all its imperfections, to the refulgent beauty of the ri&s;ing &s;un. Indeed he might have gone on through the &s;plendor of all the &s;tages of that luminary; for, if we may credit the nu|merous eulogiums on his merit and virtues, he was glorious even in his decline.</P>
<P>The character of AESOP was in every re&s;pect different. As an actor he confined him&s;elf to tra|gedy, which by this time had gone far beyond de|clamation, almo&s;t the only di&s;tinction it attained in GREECE; he &s;eems to have perfected the acting of tragedy by infu&s;ing into his very &s;oul the &s;entiments and feelings of the character he had to repre&s;ent. PLUTARCH tells us, that, one day, he performed <HI>Atreus;</HI> and in that part in which he con&s;iders how he may be&s;t kill THYESTES, he worked him&s;elf into &s;uch a pitch of ungovernable anger, that a &s;ervant happening to pa&s;s by, he &s;truck at him with his &s;ceptre and laid him dead at his feet.</P>
<P>AESOP was one of the greate&s;t voluptuaries of his time, and this may &s;erve to give an idea of the prodigious riches which were the reward of thea|trical
<PB N="121" REF="125">
talents in ROME. If an actor could have emulated the extravagance of LUCULLUS and others, and refined upon gluttony till the value of a &s;ingle di&s;h &s;hould amount to five hundred pounds; what mu&s;t have been his emoluments? AESOP is &s;aid to have gone on in this profu&s;ion during a long life; and, at length, &s;o far from dying in&s;olvent, to have left his &s;on enough to enable him to play the &s;ame game over again with additions and improve|ments; for not content with co&s;tly di&s;hes, he added co&s;tly beverage, pre&s;enting his gue&s;ts with di&s;&s;olved pearls<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CLEOPATRA, we are told, regaled ANTONY in the &s;ame man|ner.

<P>AESOP, owing, perhaps, to his profligate way of living, fell off greatly towards the latter part of his life. This failure of his powers induced him to re|tire from the &s;tage, and when, with the vanity of a veteran, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to prudence, and con|tenting him&s;elf with the well earned laurels he wore, he ra&s;hly expo&s;ed him&s;elf, many years after he had
<PB N="122" REF="126">
retired, on the opening of POMPEY's theatre. The Romans received his ineffectual efforts to plea&s;e with a mixture of pity and contempt.</P>
<P>What has injured the con&s;equence of the Roman actors, and, indeed, mo&s;t of their men of genius, is their having &s;o far let down their pride as to mix with great men who treated them merely as buffoons. SYLLA could go no where without his herd of poets, mu&s;icians, actors, and mimics; in which frolics ROSCIUS is reproached with having joined in the mummery of SOREX and MATROBIUS.</P>
<P>ANTONY is &s;aid to have come reeling to the Senate after &s;itting up all night at the wedding of HIPPIAS. The actor SERGIUS had &s;uch intere&s;t with him as to get rewards from him, and make him confer favours; and CYTHERIS, an actre&s;s, had the addre&s;s to manage his heart at her capricious will. She attended him in his excur&s;ions; her equipage was prodigiou&s;ly expen&s;ive; till, at length, &s;he be|came the mimic repre&s;entative in ROME, of what CLEOPATRA was afterwards the reality in Egypt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To keep up this re&s;emblance, FULVIA, the wife of AN|TONY, was as jealous of this actre&s;s as was his other wife OC|TAVIA, afterwards of CLEOPATRA.

This induced him to write the following epigram, which I have imitated, for I ever did, and I hope I ever &s;hall di&s;dain the &s;ervility of mere tran&s;lation.

<P><PB N="123" REF="127">After all, though the merit of the Roman actors mu&s;t have been very great and extraordinary, yet there is &s;omething extremely revolting in the &s;trange and inconvenient mediums by which the pieces were repre&s;ented to the audience. One of the actors &s;poke while another accompanied him with proper ge&s;tures. The voice of the reciter was conveyed through a tube of bra&s;s, for other|wi&s;e how could it have been heard by &s;o large an a&s;&s;embly. In order to give a &s;tronger idea than mere mu&s;cular ge&s;ticulation could do of the pa&s;&s;ion to be expre&s;&s;ed, mon&s;trous ma&s;ks were worne, ex|pre&s;&s;ing joy on one &s;ide of the face, and grief on the other; &s;o that if the ge&s;ticulator did not take
<PB N="124" REF="128">
good care he might have congratulated his friend with a &s;ad countenance, or murdered him with a merry one.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid by various authors concern|ing the&s;e ma&s;ks; more, indeed, than the &s;ubject &s;eems worthy of. It has been contended by &s;ome, that the ma&s;k covered the head and &s;houlders, un|der an idea, I pre&s;ume, that the head, thus en|larged, would throw the whole frame into &s;y|metry, when the body was rai&s;ed upon &s;tilts; but this would have been a mi&s;erable &s;hift, becau&s;e in proportion as the ma&s;k enlarged the head, and the &s;tilts lengthened the legs, the arms unfortunately would have been ridiculou&s;ly too &s;hort. Others are of opinion that the ma&s;k was hollow from the face; and, by taking a greater circumference, ap|peared to enlarge it, to which the helmit gave a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; but this expedient, when we add the &s;tilts, will put the arms in the &s;ame awkward predica|ment they were in before. The mo&s;t probable ac|count, therefore, we have is, that the ma&s;k was like gold beaters &s;kin, &s;o tran&s;parent, and &s;o artfully pre|pared and fixed, that the play of the mu&s;cles was plainly &s;een through it, and that the eyes, the mouth, and the ears, were not concealed at all.</P>
<P>On the&s;e ma&s;ks they delineated carefully the features of the very character that was to be repre|&s;ented.
<PB N="125" REF="129">
In other re&s;pects, as by the mouth and the eyes are expre&s;&s;ed the vivacity and di&s;order of the pa&s;&s;ions, the movements of the mind were di&s;ernable through this thin veil, and by this means the actor was never before the audience but the character.</P>
<P>Thus, by the help of the&s;e ma&s;ks, age became youth, and ugline&s;s beauty. PLINY tells us of an actre&s;s who performed comedy to admiration at a hundred years old, at which age one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e her whole form would need a ma&s;k.</P>
<P>We are, however, far to &s;eek in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and the farther we &s;eek the le&s;s we &s;hall be &s;atisfied. It is probable that ma&s;ks of each of the&s;e de&s;crip|tions were u&s;ed both in GREECE and in ROME; but it mu&s;t have been entirely to enforce expre&s;&s;ion on account of the great di&s;tance of the actor from the remote part of the &s;pectators; an expedient, how|ever, to remedy an inconvenience is not a per|fection; and, in &s;pight of numberle&s;s hi&s;torians, who unanimou&s;ly agree that the effect of the&s;e ma&s;ks was beyond conception a&s;toni&s;hing, in &s;pight of our conviction, as far as it relates to pantomimic characters, the ge&s;tures of which were, at the time of RICH, wonderfully expre&s;&s;ive; ma&s;ks that co|vered the &s;houlders, mu&s;t have been frightful and gigantic, ma&s;ks which extended the &s;ize of the
<PB N="126" REF="130">
face fanta&s;tic and grote&s;que, and tran&s;parent ma&s;ks, by the impo&s;&s;ibility of leaving the apertures cor|rect, and of &s;tretching them &s;o as to play in uni&s;on with the mu&s;cles, mu&s;t have exhibited an effect paralytic and ludicrous; and, in &s;pight of the pain|ter, who on the&s;e ma&s;ks laboured &s;o ingeniou&s;ly to portray the mind, the more he came up to the truth and correctne&s;s of nature, the more we &s;hould be induced to &s;ay,

<P>But there are &s;tronger objections than the&s;e, the be&s;t acting of AESOP and ROSCIUS was without ma&s;ks, and when they came to mere pantomimes, of which we are told &s;uch wonderful things, it is im|po&s;&s;ible to have conveyed a thou&s;andth part of the expre&s;&s;ion they are reported to have contained, ex|cept by an undi&s;gui&s;ed exertion of the features<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The te&s;timony borne to the celebrity of the&s;e pantomimes is truly a&s;toni&s;hing.

<P>The vagaries of NERO would claim no right to he mentioned here, being no more than the frantic acts of a magnificent madman, by profe&s;&s;ion an em|peror not an actor, had they not degraded the dra|matic ta&s;te, and ha&s;tened the theatre to its di&s;&s;olution. Happy had it been, however, for his country, and for humanity, had he contented him&s;elf with a di&s;|play of mimic greatne&s;s on the &s;tage; if, for every murder in tragedy he had not perpetrated a hundred murders among his &s;ubjects; if, with a love of tho&s;e arts that humanize and correct the heart, he had not unnaturally blended every dete&s;table and &s;anguinary pa&s;&s;ion that can deba&s;e and corrupt it.</P>

<P>Applau&s;e extorted at the point of the &s;word, attended him wherever he went.

In &s;hort, he remained a whole year in GREECE, where all was feigned extacy, and hypocritical rap|ture at his different performances; nay, he bore off from thence eighteen hundred crowns earned by his extravagant folly, and given by their political cun|ning; and, &s;o far was this from &s;oftening his mind, the remainder of his life was a &s;tudied climax of cruelty.</P>
<P>Dramatic repre&s;entations became from this period more and more licentious. The panto|mimes, which had long prevailed, and which had

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. SPANISH THEATRE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the theatre in SPAIN, even to this moment, has never had to boa&s;t of any thing regularly dramatic, it would be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to give a methodical account of it. The wit and humour that have &s;o lavi&s;hly pervaded it, manife&s;t the mo&s;t luxuriant fertility in the genius of their dramatic writers; who&s;e works, crude and irregular as they are, have &s;erved like a rich mine for the French, and, indeed, the Engli&s;h at &s;econd hand to dig in. Their wit, however, like their hard dollars, can never be con&s;idered as &s;taple, but a u&s;ele&s;s ma&s;s of no intrin&s;ic value till manufactured into literary merchandize by the ingenuity and labour of other countries.</P>
<P>The Spaniards had &s;ome knowledge of dramatic entertainments, even when the Romans began fir&s;t to be celebrated for good poetry. The ruins of &s;o many ancient theatres&mdash;the ve&s;tiges of which are
<PB N="132" REF="136">
yet to be &s;een in their principal towns&mdash;give incon|te&s;tible proofs how much they were delighted with this &s;pecies of amu&s;ement; but the Goths, and other Barbarians that overrun the kingdom, drove out the Mu&s;es, and con&s;equently among them THA|LIA. As for MELPOMENE &s;he never even to this hour re&s;ided in SPAIN.</P>
<P>The Arabs, however, brought THALIA back again, and by introducing a rude &s;ort of &s;uper&s;ti|tious drama, which was intermingled with grote&s;que provincial farce, e&s;tabli&s;hed the foundation of the fir&s;t Ca&s;tilian plays. The &s;ubjects were &s;ometimes the loves of &s;hepherds, and &s;ometimes different points of religion; &s;uch as the birth of our Sa|viour, the Pa&s;&s;ion, the Temptation in the De&s;ert, and the Martyrdom of &s;ome of the Saints. The&s;e &s;acred pieces were played as intermezzos, and the decorations con&s;i&s;ted of views of Paradi&s;e, Hell, the Trinity, the Sacrament, and to make the re|&s;emblance more intere&s;ting, it was no unu&s;ual thing, in this &s;trange jumble of &s;acred and pro|phane, to admini&s;ter benedictions, and &s;ing <HI>Te Deum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have gone yet but a little way towards this on our &s;tage. In action we have to be &s;ure now and then introduced <HI>Noah's Ark, Solomon's Temple, Heaven, Hell,</HI> and &s;ome other &s;imilar objects, and held up MOSES, AARON, and the Man after GOD's own heart as free-ma&s;ons. But in our oratorios we come on pretty well. The <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;iah,</HI> the <HI>Redemption,</HI> and &s;uch familiar titles&mdash;by way of com|panions to the <HI>Tarantula</HI> and the <HI>Cabinet</HI> of <HI>Monkies</HI>&mdash;are &s;ported again&s;t all the old walls in town; and I remember in one of the&s;e &s;acred dramas, as they are facetiou&s;ly called, which had for its title the <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> that in the moment OUR SAVIOUR is &s;uppo&s;ed gradually to di&s;appear <HI>to &s;oft mu&s;ic,</HI> the orche&s;tra, in a mo&s;t rapturous &s;tyle, &s;truck up, <Q REND="inline">"<HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">el take the Wars that hurried Willy from me.</HI>"</Q> This charming performance, by way of digre&s;&s;ion, was performed <HI>once,</HI> and GIARDINI was pre&s;ent. After it was over that connoi&s;&s;eur was a&s;ked how he liked the mu&s;ic, to which he an&s;wered:

Though, however, we have yet only gone the&s;e lengths, I think we need not de&s;pair. When the rage for HANDEL's mu&s;ic &s;hall be a little higher&mdash;for our pre&s;ent inattention can only be con&s;idered as a paroxy&s;m gone off&mdash;I &s;hould not think it extraordinary if we were to be entertained with &s;eeing the mighty SAMSON pull down the pa&s;teboard temple of DAGON, the &s;hepherds in the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> piping to profile &s;heep, or that noble <HI>Coup de theatre in Jo&s;hua,</HI> where Mr. HANDEL &s;o beautifully <HI>makes the &s;un &s;tand &s;till,</HI> TO MUSIC. But &s;uch bold improvements one can only expect by degrees: in the mean time we mu&s;t content our&s;elves, if we would wi&s;h, according to the cant phra&s;e, to &s;ee &s;uch objects as natural as life, with re&s;orting to tho&s;e itinerant theatres called puppet-&s;hews, where Mr. PUNCH introduces you to the whole court of SOLOMON, by way of fir&s;t piece, and afterwards entertains you with JEPTHA's <HI>ra&s;h vow,</HI> or the <HI>Virgin &s;acrificed,</HI> for a farce.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>What a&s;toni&s;hes one mo&s;t is the ludicrous and bla&s;phemous applications they continually make of the texts of &s;cripture. There is &s;carcely any pa&s;&s;age in the prayers of the church, or in holy writ, but is employed in the&s;e burle&s;que &s;cenes in the mo&s;t in|decent manner.

<P>The&s;e extraordinary jumbles, however, are now little performed, except in the remote parts of the kingdom, where prejudice &s;till reigns in all its in|fluence;&mdash;whereas, at CADIZ, BARCELONA, VA|LENCIA, and MADRID&mdash;which places are fre|quented by &s;trangers, and con&s;equently more po|li&s;hed&mdash;the dramatic entertainments are better re|gulated.</P>
<P>At the early period of the Spani&s;h drama, while
<PB N="135" REF="139">
buffoons, jugglers, and hi&s;trions, who found their way to SPAIN as well as to ROME, amu&s;ed the peo|ple with the&s;e heterogeneous repre&s;entations, men of good &s;en&s;e, who noticed the regularity and nature which characteri&s;ed the be&s;t works of antiquity, be|held with di&s;plea&s;ure how much the&s;e mon&s;trous farces were beneath the wi&s;dom and the ta&s;te of the ancients.</P>
<P>A &s;trong de&s;ire to remedy this, induced them to compo&s;e dialogues, which they called comedies; yet the&s;e were too tedious and unconnected to ad|mit of repre&s;entation. Their tendency, however, was meritorious, but they made little progre&s;s to|wards the cure of the licentious manners of the times. At length the&s;e plays began to be mixed with that very libertini&s;m they were originally written to explode.</P>
<P>Such is the famous comedy of <HI>Calixtus and Melibeus,</HI> where the de&s;criptions are &s;o lively, the characters &s;o loo&s;e, and the circum&s;tances &s;o la&s;ci|vious, that it was con&s;idered as dangerous to expo&s;e them to public repre&s;entation. In other re&s;pects the&s;e plays were much too long to be patiently heard to an end; yet as they ardently wi&s;hed for &s;ome|thing on the &s;tage le&s;s reproachable, &s;ome tran&s;la|tions in pro&s;e from the Greek and Latin drama ef|fected
<PB N="136" REF="140">
in time a con&s;iderable reform in the Spani&s;h theatre.</P>
<P>LOPES DE RUEDA, a native of SEVILLE, was the fir&s;t who gave reputation to the drama in SPAIN. He was both a poet and a player. CERVANTES &s;ays that he excelled in pa&s;toral poetry, which he worked as epi&s;odes into his dramatic pieces&mdash;but the theatre was yet a rude piece of building, con|taining only four very long &s;eats. The actors were habited in &s;kins fringed with gold, and in a large piece of tape&s;try, drawn a&s;ide by two cords, con|&s;i&s;ted the whole of their &s;cenery, machinery, and decoration; but yet they were greatly followed, and RUEDA acquired incredible reputation in parts of &s;implicity, braggadocia, and vulgarity.</P>
<P>The famous author of <HI>Don Quixote,</HI> &s;tarted as a comic writer. With a happy and fertile invention, he wrote &s;everal admirable pieces which might have &s;erved as a model to his country. LOPES DE VEGA, on the contrary, de&s;pi&s;ed the rules of the ancients, and bani&s;hed probability, regularity, and decency from the &s;tage. His heroes came into the world, grew up, became old, and died in the &s;ame repre&s;entation. They ran all over the earth; they &s;lept in the ea&s;t, dined in the north, and when he found the world too &s;mall for their pranks, he conducted them into
<PB N="137" REF="141">
the air, to go to bed. His valets &s;poke the lan|guage of courtiers, his princes of coxcombs, and his ladies of quality that of fi&s;h women. His actors made their entrance in a mob, and their exits in confu&s;ion. In one piece probably you have &s;ixty principal characters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CERVANTES blamed LOPES DE VEGA, for this licentious abu&s;e of the ancient rules; to which LOPES an&s;wered:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"As the people pay us, it is very proper we &s;hould plea&s;e then, which no|thing but the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance can do; I, therefore, lock up ARIS|TOTLE and HORACE, becau&s;e they continually reproach me for de|parting from my duty as a dramatic writer, and as for PLAUTUS and TERENCE I never hold any conver&s;ation with them but they have the impudence to critici&s;e every one of my productions."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The rules of art were not much better ob&s;erved in CALDERONE. A play is the hi&s;tory of a man's whole life, which he &s;ometimes contrives to &s;pin out for &s;ixty years, without plan, preparation, or probability; and, to add to all this barbarous ab|&s;ence of ta&s;te, the more affecting &s;cenes are filled with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t buffoonery. A Prince, in a &s;itua|tion of inexpre&s;&s;ible wretchedne&s;s, is interrupted by the &s;en&s;ele&s;s plea&s;antry of &s;ome impertinent &s;ervant: and yet, in &s;pight of the&s;e defects, CALDERONE is the idol of the Spani&s;h theatre; and after all it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that you admire in his &s;tyle a noblene&s;s of diction, an elegance without ob&s;curity, while his artful manner of keeping the &s;pectators in
<PB N="138" REF="142">
a plea&s;ing yet continual &s;u&s;pence, has a truly in|genious and comic effect.</P>
<P>SOLIS, MORETO, ZAMORA, CANDAMO, and CANIZAREZ, merit prai&s;e for having approached nearer to regularity. That, however, which we find mo&s;t wonderful in the dramatic authors of this nation is the prodigious, the immen&s;e quantity of their works. It is impo&s;&s;ible to hear without ado|ni&s;hment that LOPES DE VEGA compo&s;ed two thou&s;and different pieces for the &s;tage; yet, when we con&s;ider the nature and the form of the&s;e works, the phenomenon is more ea&s;y to be conceived. The Spaniards have a great number of rhap&s;odies under the titles of chronicles, annals, romances, and legends. In the&s;e they find &s;ome hi&s;torical anecdote, &s;ome entertaining adventure, which they tran&s;cribe without choice or exception. All the details they put into dialogue and to this compilation is given the di&s;|tinction, PLAY: thus one can ea&s;ily imagine that a man in the habit of copying with facility, could write forty of the&s;e plays in le&s;s time than an author of real genius and regulated habitude could put out of his hands a &s;ingle act; for the latter is obliged to de&s;ign his characters, to pre|pare, graduate, and develope his intrigue, and to reconcile all this to the rules of decency, ta&s;te, probability, and, indeed, cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="143">It is curious that the Spani&s;h plays, which are no more than romances in dialogue, have been frequently re-transformed into romance. The ta&s;k cannot be difficult: it is only to render the dia|logue again into recital. LE SAGE has done this &s;everal times in <HI>Gil Blas,</HI> and this is not the wor&s;t part of the work. His hi&s;tory of AURORA DE GUZMAN is tran&s;lated from a play of MORETO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our THOMSON goes &s;till further, and gives us, in his <HI>Tan|cred and Sigi&s;munda,</HI> a novel out of <HI>Gil Blas.</HI> MOORE, who&s;e <HI>Game&s;ter</HI> is &s;o full of tenderne&s;s, and proves, in &s;pight of MADAME DACIER, and all DE LA MOTTE's enemies that pro&s;e touches the heart more &s;en&s;ibly than ver&s;e, has given the Engli&s;h &s;tage another play which has its origin in the &s;ame work. It is, indeed, a very ad|vantageous thing for the theatre that hi&s;torical ju&s;tice obliges me to record this; for it points out a &s;ource of materials through which the &s;tage may be &s;upplied for ages, which &s;ource, in its primitive &s;tate, though a kind of literary chaos, is to the full as regular as mo&s;t of the modern dramatic productions. It is true this fountain has been frequently vi&s;ited, particularly by the ladies. But it is a &s;ource difficult to exhau&s;t; and if, after all, authors are too dull, or too lazy to carry their theatrical pitchers to the fountain; or too fear|ful&mdash;for pitchers of all kinds too often come home cracked at la&s;t&mdash;they have nothing to do but &s;teal the pitchers of their neighbours, the French, and appropriate, in a retail way, the contents to their own advantage.</NOTE>. Nor has LE SAGE been the only one who has built a reputation on the plunder of Spani&s;h dramati&s;ts. Madam GOMEZ, SCARRON, and others have done the &s;ame; and it may be fairly averred, that mo&s;t
<PB N="140" REF="144">
of the novels which had &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s in the la&s;t century in FRANCE, and part of this century in ENGLAND, are nothing more than Spani&s;h dramas metamorpho&s;ed into French and Engli&s;h narrations.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be allowed that no nation was ever &s;o fertile in invention, or &s;o wide of regularity as SPAIN: the rea&s;on is evident. Spani&s;h gallantry con&s;i&s;ts entirely of &s;tratagem; and fancy is per|petually upon the &s;tretch to bring about natural events by extraordinary means. Their manners are derived originally from the Moors, and are tinged with a &s;ort of African ta&s;te, too wild and extra|vagant for the adoption of other nations, and which cannot accommodate it&s;elf to rule or preci&s;ion.</P>

They enter the li&s;ts of gallantry as if they were more plea&s;ed with the dangers of the tournament than the enjoyment of the reward; and, at length, when they arrive at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that object with which they were originally &s;mitten with a glance from a lattice, or a regard in a cloi&s;ter through a thick veil; di&s;appointment &s;uc|ceeds to admiration, and they grow jealous and outrageous to find that love is the very rever&s;e of

After a number of dangers and difficulties, the lovers in the romance contrive a meeting; when, in&s;tead of profiting by the opportunity, they enter into a long con|ver&s;ation on the vi&s;&s;icitudes of love, and accu&s;e fortune for having kept them &s;o long a&s;under. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Was ever any thing &s;o &s;tupid,'</Q> cries the lady, throwing her book away;

<P>We have no account of even one Spani&s;h tra|gedy. The authors cho&s;e their characters indi&s;|criminately;
<PB N="142" REF="146">
criminately; and it is very common to hear kings, princes, mini&s;ters, pea&s;ants, valets, bravoes, and hangmen trying which &s;hall be loude&s;t at the &s;ame &s;cene; nay &s;ometimes the latter cla&s;s have all the intere&s;ting &s;ituations, while kings and nobles are the buffoons of the piece. It is not that the Spaniards want genius to arrive to this &s;pecies of dramatic writing: on the contrary, there is an elevation in their minds, a grandeur in their ideas, and a noble|ne&s;s in their &s;entiments; but they know little of judgment and ta&s;te, nor can their redundant imagina|tions conform to the rules of art.</P>

<P>Fortunately for this &s;trange adventurer, after he had gulled the Engli&s;h to their eternal reproach, and received &s;uch a reception from the French, as convinced him they were as well ver&s;ed in trick as him&s;elf, the king of SPAIN happened to langui&s;h under a complaint for which, according to his phy&s;i|cians there could be no cure but mu&s;ic.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t celebrated dramatic poet among the Portugue&s;e was BALTHAZAR, of the i&s;land of MA|DEIRA, who wrote ancient dramas called Auto, of which the greate&s;t part was made up of pious &s;ub|jects&mdash;like the ancient my&s;teries in FRANCE.&mdash;HENRY DE GOMEZ wrote twenty-two comedies, and GIL VINCENT, whom they looked upon as the PLAUTUS of PORTUGAL, &s;erved as a model for LOPES DE VEGA and QUIVEDO.

<P>Spani&s;h pieces, however, are tho&s;e which are ge|nerally performed at LISBON; but the theatre be|ing extremely di&s;couraged, has long langui&s;hed there. Had it not been for the king's order, no opera would ever have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in that capital; and, perhaps, it might as well have been let alone, for when they had their theatre, they had nothing to perform in it; whereas, at that time in

<P>DRAMATIC entertainments had birth in modern ITALY under LEO the tenth.&mdash;The <HI>Sophoni&s;ba</HI> of the celebrated Prelate TRISSINO, the pope's nuncio, was the fir&s;t regular tragedy known in Europe after tho&s;e barbarous ages of which I have already given an account; as was the <HI>Calandra</HI> of Cardinal BIBIENA, the fir&s;t comedy.</P>
<P>The Italians, however, &s;eem to have had as in|different a ta&s;te for theatrical repre&s;entations as the ancient Romans; as may be gathered from the fol|lowing account of <HI>Radami&s;tus and Zenobia.</HI> The piece begins with a combat between more than a hundred per&s;ons. They fight on the &s;tage, be&s;iege a place, and carry it by a&s;&s;ault, and, though the whole drift of the tragedy is intended to be as affect|ing as po&s;&s;ible, Punchello is one of the warriors who frightens the combatants, parodies the be&s;t &s;peeches, makes a je&s;t of the hero, and behaves with all the ridiculous buffoonery of a puppet; and that the
<PB N="150" REF="154">
heroine may not want as &s;triking a contra&s;t as the hero, Zenobia's nur&s;e is repre&s;ented by a man with a black beard, and a wig made out of a lamb's &s;kin with the wool on. This tender female talks of vir|tue and delicacy, is frightened le&s;t &s;ome one &s;hould offer violence to her charms, and gives her&s;elf a thou&s;and childi&s;h and coquetti&s;h airs.</P>
<P>ARIOSTO wrote for the &s;tage. It is &s;aid that his father one day was, on &s;ome occa&s;ion, extremely angry with him. ARIOSTO li&s;tened to him with the mo&s;t &s;teady patience, and mo&s;t profound attention. He neither &s;aid a &s;ingle word in contradiction of his father, or ju&s;tification of him&s;elf; but on the con|trary, heard him to an end with an impatient cu|rio&s;ity, and &s;eemed to wi&s;h that the lecture had con|tinued longer. A friend who was pre&s;ent a&s;ked him after his father was gone why he had not &s;aid &s;omething in his own defence. ARIOSTO an&s;wered that he had been for &s;ome days working at a comedy, and on that very morning had been at a lo&s;s how to write a &s;cene of a father reprimanding his &s;on, that at the moment his father fir&s;t opened his mouth, it &s;truck him as an admirable opportunity to examine his manner with attention, that &s;o he might paint his picture after nature, and being thus employed, he had noticed only the voice, the face and the action
<PB N="151" REF="155">
of his Father, without in the lea&s;t regarding the truth or fal&s;ehood of what he laid to his charge.</P>
<P>In the time of RANUSE FARNESE, duke of Parma, a prince of uncommon under&s;tanding, an old nobleman blindly gave him&s;elf up to the arts of an infamous woman. The duke, who had a great regard for his courtier, was touched that he &s;hould be a victim to &s;o &s;hameful a pa&s;&s;ion, and did every thing in his power to cure him of his folly, without informing him of it in direct terms. At length, having made &s;everal attempts without &s;ucce&s;s, he cau&s;ed a comedy to be written, wherein the old no|bleman's ab&s;urdity was &s;o &s;trongly drawn, that it could not be mi&s;taken; and yet &s;o artfully, that it might be known for per&s;onality only by him whom it was intended to reclaim. The duke took the nobleman to the play, who &s;truck with the reproach, not only turned off his mi&s;tre&s;s, but privately thanked the duke for a le&s;&s;on by which he benefitted as long as he lived.</P>
<P>The Italian tragedies are mi&s;erable indeed. They are languid, verbo&s;e, and unintere&s;ting, unle&s;s the human mind can be intere&s;ted by &s;ubjects of hor|ror.

<P>The Italian opera had &s;ome re&s;emblance of the theatre in ATHENS. Italian recitative, like ancient declamation, was noted, and &s;u&s;tained <HI>ad libitum</HI> by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3 letters">cal in&s;truments. The choru&s;&s;es, which were added after a time, and which belonged to the body of the piece, and made a part of the general &s;ubject, were, and indeed are yet, expre&s;&s;ed by a &s;pecies of mu&s;ic different from the recitative, in the &s;ame man|ner as the &s;trophe, the epode, and the anti&s;trophe of the Greeks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ung in a manner totally different from the declamation. This was yet more clo&s;ely adhered to as the&s;e &s;pectacles became more perfect, for in many of the &s;erious operas of the Abbe METASTASIO the unity of time, place, and action, are ob&s;erved; and to this we may add, that the&s;e pieces are full of that poetic expre&s;&s;ion and fi|ni&s;hed elegance, which embelli&s;h a natural &s;ubject without confu&s;ing it, and which the French &s;ay AD|DISON only attained among the Engli&s;h, and we that RACINE alone arrived to among the French.</P>
<P>TASSO, GUARINI, and others have al&s;o writ|written
<PB N="153" REF="157">

<P>Other writers, however were not of opinion that pa&s;torals were true comedy; for they acknow|ledged nothing under that title that was not a jum|ble of every &s;pecies; and, as it were, GOLDONI, MACHIAVEL, TASSO, and GUARINI, all beat up together. Thus you had in one piece, in mo|dern ROME, all tho&s;e &s;ubjects united, which, in an|cient ROME, it required &s;o many quarrels to keep &s;eparate.</P>
<P>Haughty tyrants, langui&s;hing lovers, bears, devils,
<PB N="154" REF="158">
cupids, and &s;caramouches were pre&s;ented you all in the &s;ame piece; and every thing was conducted in a manner &s;o truly ridiculous, that if their intention was that comedy from that time &s;hould be con&s;idered as nothing more than a dramatic exhibition to excite laughter, they fairly &s;ucceeded; for, what with the &s;tupidity, the ab&s;urdity, or the humour it was im|po&s;&s;ible to avoid laughing throughout the piece. Unfortunately, however, as much as they gained on the &s;ide of the &s;en&s;es they lo&s;t on the &s;ide of the heart; for whatever the&s;e might be to create mirth, there was nothing to create intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I very much que&s;tion, however, whether the&s;e very comedies did not go a great way towards per|fecting that &s;pecies of dramatic production; for when they come to be incorporated into the French theatre, the hi&s;tory of which circum&s;tance will be hereafter particularly related, they diffu&s;ed a light|ne&s;s into the French ta&s;te, which had long langui&s;hed under the verbo&s;ity and dullne&s;s of their comedies, as they were called, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome &s;ingle unin|tere&s;ting action drawled on through five acts of monotonous ver&s;e.</P>
<P>This lightne&s;s, infu&s;ing it&s;elf into general ta&s;te, obliged dramatic writers to become conformi&s;ts; and as it approached nearer to nature than the old
<PB N="155" REF="159">
&s;y&s;tem, as it became adopted by men of real merit who knew what to pre&s;erve and what to reject, comedy, by degrees, became intere&s;ting as well as amu&s;ing.</P>
<P>It is certain, however, it never attained per|fection, a di&s;tinction it certainly once knew in this country, till we improved, in that as we have done in every effort of genius, on the French; and I &s;hall in&s;tance VANBRUGH's comedy of the <HI>Con|federacy,</HI> which he tran&s;lated from REGNARD, to prove this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, though the Italians continued to breathe the &s;ame air, and enjoy the influence of the &s;ame &s;un which warmed the Romans, they were no longer di&s;tingui&s;hed by their talents, nor animated with their virtues, for there was nothing left in ITALY of ROME but its vices. Greatne&s;s, courage, and manline&s;s were gone, and nothing but effeminacy, voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s remained, and thus, if the Roman theatrical repre&s;entations, by reflecting them&s;elves, were a mixture of virtue and vice; tho&s;e of the Italians, through the &s;ame mirror, were a ma&s;s of vice without the relief of any virtue at all.</P>
<P>ITALY has been famous for the comedies of

GOLDONI, though they are the wilde&s;t rhap&s;odies that can be conceived.

<P>THE German theatre is about as ancient as the French, and till the times of CORNEILLE and MO|LIERE was as brilliant, and abounded as much in good authors.

<P>The German opera, &s;o much e&s;teemed in the la&s;t century, particularly in HAMBURG, BRUNOWIG, WEIFFENFELS, and LEIPSIC, is no more, the Ita|lian opera has taken its place.</P>
<P>The theatre at AMSTERDAM owes its origin to two &s;ocieties of rhetoricians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dramatic productions have overrun HOLLAND as well as every part of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">RMANY, and have reached even to SWEDEN; where they were e&s;tabli&s;hed by the famous BARON DE HOGBERA, a very extra|ordinary character. He was the &s;on of a &s;oldier, who, from the ranks, became ennobled. Deprived of his parents very early in life, and de&s;titute of fortune, he taught him&s;elf to read; and, going on &s;tep by &s;tep, he acquired a con&s;iderable in&s;ight into &s;everal &s;ciences with no ma&s;ter but his own genius and ob&s;ervation. At &s;eventeen years old, without money or recommendation, he determined to make the tour of Europe on foot, to perfect him&s;elf in his &s;tudies. He traver&s;ed FRANCE, GERMANY, and HOLLAND, where he in&s;tructed the pea&s;ants in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;erent methods to improve hu&s;bandry, and received lodging and nutriment for his pains. After this he arrived in EN|GLAND enriched with all the knowledge of Europe. The public, however, knew little of his merit till he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf at CO|PENHAGEN, where his excellent productions &s;oon made him known and admired. His comedies, eighteen in number, e&s;tabli&s;hed the Dani&s;h theatre.</NOTE>, compo&s;ed of an in|finite number of di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons, men of let|ters, juri&s;con&s;ults, and magi&s;trates. BARDEZIUS, burgoma&s;ter and coun&s;ellor, P. C. HOOFT, the cele|brated
<PB N="159" REF="163">
poet, and the famous JOOST VAN VONDEL, were at the head of the confederacy.</P>
<P>The&s;e two &s;ocieties began to di&s;pute on dif|ferent &s;ubjects about 1584. Their pieces at fir&s;t were only dialogues in ver&s;e on the news of the time, the events of the nation, or mithological fic|tions; and &s;erved very meritoriou&s;ly as a &s;chool to regulate the manners and furni&s;h the amu&s;ement of a laborious and indu&s;trious people.</P>
<P>In time, however, they di&s;agreed. Each &s;o|ciety ridiculed the proceedings of the other, and their former eloquence degenerated into &s;evere in|vective and bitter &s;atire; till, at length, to obtain order, the magi&s;trates came to a determination to &s;uppre&s;s them both. The people were, however, unwilling to give up their favourite plea&s;ure; and after a variety of difficulties, it was finally agreed that they &s;hould unite. This gave &s;atisfaction to all parties, and, about 1635, a phy&s;ician of the name of SAMUEL KOSTER, built a theatre where both the &s;ocieties were incorporated into one body.</P>
<P>KOSTER, however, could not &s;upport the ex|pence of this theatre, and it was bought of him by the guardians of the orphans and the aged, to who&s;e u&s;e the profits were charitably appropriated; and thus, by converting it into an in&s;titution &s;o lauda|ble,
<PB N="160" REF="164">
the theatre began to have con&s;iderable ce|lebrity.</P>
<P>The performances, however, with the exception of a very few, were gro&s;s and bea&s;tly. In one of them, which is a repre&s;entation of ABRAHAM offer|ing up his &s;on ISAAC, ABRAHAM having tied ISAAC to a &s;take, very lei&s;urely takes out an old ru&s;ty hor&s;e pi&s;tol, and mea&s;uring &s;ix paces with great de|liberation, pre&s;ents his piece; when, all of a &s;udden, finding &s;ome wet de&s;cend into the pan, he looks up and &s;ees an angel in a certain attitude, who had oc|ca&s;ioned what he had mi&s;taken for rain. ABRAHAM is in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation, when the angel cries out, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Der taiple ABRAHAM will ta te younker &s;lauken?"</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e brutal repre&s;entations made up for a con&s;i|derable time the delight of the Mynheers; till, at length, they improved the &s;tage by tran&s;lations of Spani&s;h comedies, and French tragedies, originally introduced by a &s;ociety of Portugue&s;e Jews, who e&s;tabli&s;hed a theatre, to which the Hollanders were invited gratis, the better to keep up a good under|&s;tanding between the Portugue&s;e and the Dutch in commercial negociations.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t efforts, however, were clum&s;y enough. If CALDERONE was full of extravagance on the

Spani&s;h theatre, his curvettes, and his caprioles, were, of cour&s;e, imitated, as awkwardly on the &s;tage of AMSTERDAM, as a guinea pig imitates a &s;quirrel; and, as for CORNEILLE I cannot re|frain from giving one in&s;tance how adroitly he was rendered into Dutch.</P>
<P>There is a well known pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Cid,</HI> where the father of RODORIGO &s;timulates his &s;on to re|venge; and, not &s;atisfied with the a&s;&s;urance he had before given him, &s;topping him &s;hort he &s;ays,

<P>Yet we have &s;een the theatre in GREECE an ob|ject of real importance; for it is difficult to con|ceive a truer picture of exalted greatne&s;s than that meritorious di&s;tinction which could at once cor|rect di&s;&s;ipation and conciliate ferocity; and this was exactly the operation of the theatre in its influence over ATHENS and SPARTA immediately before ARISTOPHANES.</P>

<P>What are the&s;e rules but a recommendation of what was con&s;idered as perfection in GREECE?
<PB N="169" REF="173">
ARISTOTLE has added nothing to this; he has only repeated word for word the methods which regu|lated the writings of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES, without adding a &s;ingle idea to theirs but what has confounded the the&s;is on which he re&s;ts his argument.</P>
<P>He recommends the unity of action, certainly an important precept, but already put in practice before he &s;ugge&s;ted it.

But the preceptor of ALEXANDER was obliged to &s;quare his dramatic rules by tho&s;e which were mo&s;t likely to flatter his di&s;ciple. He, therefore, in this in&s;tance de&s;erts his original plan, probably becau&s;e he trembled under the hand that had &s;trangled CA|LISTHENES and PARMENIO, in who&s;e plot again&s;t the life of ALEXANDER he was by the way &s;u&s;|pected to have had a hand.</P>
<P>The &s;ublime genius of ARISTOTLE made the wonderful di&s;covery that there are but four &s;orts of tragedy. There are as many &s;orts as there are &s;ub|jects, ju&s;t as there are as many faces as there are men. Nature is infinite, and it is &s;terility alone that &s;earches for excu&s;es in the ab&s;ence of invention.</P>
<P>He in&s;i&s;ts that tragedy ought to be confined to a &s;mall number of families, a reflection evidently that comes from ancient GREECE, very proper for the ob&s;ervance, at that time, of that republic, but which, held out to other nations, would re&s;train the art rather than extend it. Thus the inviolable rules of ARISTOTLE, which it is ridiculous to apply ge|nerally to other nations, are no more than an enu|meration of the beauties he found in the Greek poets; and, as to the faults which he has held up as proper to be exploded, he might as well have been &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, for as they are gro&s;s and palpa|ble,
<PB N="171" REF="175">
and &s;uch as no man of genius could po&s;&s;ibly have &s;tumbled on.</P>
<P>Thus ARISTOTLE has written nothing new on this &s;ubject.

<P><PB N="180" REF="184">It is plain that the&s;e performances, whatever they were, though intended to promote civilization had an effect exactly the rever&s;e; for they grew to &s;uch a licentious height that, in the eighth century, CHARLEMAGNE was obliged to &s;uppre&s;s them; vainly, however, for the habitude had obtained, and the people would not be diverted from their amu&s;e|ment; and &s;ince they had lo&s;t their plea&s;ure, becau&s;e it was con&s;idered as irreligious, they were determined to make religion it&s;elf the means of re&s;toring it. To this the prie&s;ts had no objection, for in multiplying religious ceremonies they multiplied their own emo|luments; till, as the prie&s;ts of BACCHUS encouraged the&s;e early repre&s;entations in GREECE, &s;o the prie&s;ts of FRANCE willingly turned the churches into the|atres, where they permitted ridiculous farces, in|decent dances, and &s;acriligious buffooneries. The very vaults where the &s;aints were depo&s;ited echoed with &s;candalous and impious &s;ongs.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions the prie&s;ts often turned actors, and &s;ometimes actre&s;&s;es; hiding their &s;anctity and their &s;acerdotal robes under grote&s;que habits and ridiculous ma&s;ks; in which di&s;gui&s;es they very frequently got drunk, quarrelled, and &s;ought.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;graceful &s;pectacles continued more or le&s;s, according to circum&s;tances, till about the mid+dle
<PB N="181" REF="185">
of the twelfth century, when EUDES DE SULII, bi&s;hop of PARIS, thundered his anathemas again&s;t the&s;e &s;acred farces; which, however, were but little &s;uppre&s;&s;ed till the Cru&s;ades, when, the &s;pirit of the nation leaning towards every thing religious, the French checked whatever &s;erved to render religion ridiculous; be&s;ides it now became meritorious to con&s;orm to religion and yet act farces. Pilgrimages, and wars with the cro&s;s as their en&s;ign were good theatrical matter. Troops of the&s;e devout itin|erants were con&s;tantly appearing in the &s;quares and in the market places, and no one was con&s;idered as a capital actor who had not noviciated at NOTRE|DAME DU PUY, St. JAMES OF COMPOSTELLA, or JERUSALEM.</P>
<P>The&s;e pilgrims, mounted upon &s;caffolds, &s;ung &s;piritual canticles, which they had compo&s;ed on their journies, and exhibited &s;cenes in which they repre&s;ented &s;ome my&s;tery of religion, or the life of &s;ome Saint, till, at length, they formed a &s;ociety, the particulars of which we &s;hall &s;ee in its place.</P>
<P>In the mean time we will return to the time when SULLI began to anathematize holy bu&s;&s;oonery, at which epoch it appears that the people, beginning to be di&s;appointed of their amu&s;ement through the medium of the church, invited writers and per+formers
<PB N="182" REF="186">
to continue it through the medium of tho&s;e &s;avage fea&s;ts in which FRANCE was &s;o fond of emu|lating the Romans.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cours pl&eacute;nieres,</HI> the <HI>Tournois,</HI> and the <HI>Ca|rou&s;els</HI> were an imitation of the &s;anguinary amu&s;e|ments of their ancient ma&s;ters, and offered to the eyes of the &s;pectator a frightful image of war and all its horrors. By degrees, however, &s;till like the Romans, the French united in their exerci&s;es, ob|jects le&s;s &s;hocking and offen&s;ive, in which they in|troduced poetry, which was &s;ung at their repa&s;ts during the intervals of &s;erving the different cour&s;es, and therefore called <HI>entremets.</HI></P>
<P>The provincial poets, that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e born in the &s;outhern provinces of FRANCE and who &s;poke a language derived from the Romans, and called <HI>Romane provencale</HI> and the French poets born in the northern provinces, who&s;e language came from the &s;ame &s;ource, but was pronounced differently, and, therefore, called <HI>Romane Fran&s;coi&s;e,</HI> the&s;e two &s;orts of poets were the original authors and per|formers of all the &s;pectacles which, though bar|barous enough in them&s;elves, relieved tho&s;e &s;avage &s;ea&s;ts called the <HI>Cours Plenieres.</HI></P>
<P>They cho&s;e &s;uch grand circum&s;tances as the
<PB N="183" REF="187">
marriages of &s;overeigns, or the celebration of cer|tain days in the year, either appointed to comme|morate great national events, or con&s;ecrated to re|ligious purpo&s;es. The provincial poets were called <HI>Troubadours,</HI> and the French <HI>Trouverres,</HI> which word in both dialects &s;ignifies di&s;coverers, finders, in|ventors.</P>
<P>Their inventions were called <HI>Jeux partis,</HI> and were divided into what they called <HI>Sirventes</HI> and <HI>Ten&s;ons.</HI> Tho&s;e called <HI>Sirventes</HI> were &s;atires le|velled at all &s;orts of people, &s;omething re&s;embling the Saturnines and Fe&s;cenines of the Romans be|fore LIVIUS ANDRONICUS, and the Song of the Goat among the Greeks before THESPIS.</P>
<P>In the&s;e performances called <HI>Ten&s;ons</HI> the &s;ub|ject was love. They were written in dialogue and executed by &s;everal interlocutors. Furni&s;hed with a number of the&s;e pieces, which were lighter, ea&s;ier to perform, and capable of affording more general amu&s;ement than the Sirventes, the Troubadours and Troverres of the eleventh century, went about from town to town, and villa to villa, accompanied by their min&s;trels, their juglers, their po&s;ture ma&s;ters, and their rope-dancers; who, uniting their different talents, performed <HI>entremets,</HI> or entertainments, to amu&s;e large companies.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="188">By degrees the&s;e &s;pectacles were varied and ex|tended. Farces and pantomimes were introduced re|pre&s;enting &s;ubjects from hi&s;tory, and in tho&s;e pieces were brought forward terre&s;trial and aquatic animals, and &s;cenes, machinery, and decorations of mo&s;t ingenious execution, and upon an immen&s;e &s;cale.</P>
<P>It is difficult to &s;ay what were the dimen&s;ions of tho&s;e buildings where the&s;e amu&s;ements were per|formed, or to e&s;timate the prodigious expence they incurred. The mechanic art at that time mu&s;t have arrived to great perfection, and the re&s;ources of tho&s;e who encouraged it have been immen&s;e, to have executed &s;uch ingenious and extraordinary concep|tions, and have defrayed the con&s;equent expence, e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider that they were per|formed but a few days in one place.</P>
<P>The dramatic art, however, was yet unknown. This itinerant poetry, like tho&s;e who cultivated it, knew nothing of any fixed rule. It con&s;i&s;ted of irregular &s;ongs on the &s;ubjects of love and arms, or per&s;onal prai&s;e or &s;atire, performed by troops of vagabonds, who united poets, compo&s;ers, actors, &s;ingers, and orche&s;tra, all, perhaps, in one family.</P>

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Song begat poetry, or at lea&s;t was born with it. The

poetry of Trouverres was made to be &s;ung. During the repa&s;t of a prince, a trouverre would arrive with his min&s;trels, and his juglers, who began to &s;ing to their harps and viols &s;ome curious ver&s;es that were comopo&s;ed for the occa&s;ion. Tho&s;e who both &s;ung and wrote were mo&s;t e&s;teemed. Among the ancient trouverres we find a great number who boa&s;ted &s;uch exalted names, that there is &s;carcely at this time a noble|man that would not have been very happy to have de&s;cended from them. Every one who could claim a right to half, or even a quarter, of a family ca&s;tle, though the remainder were mort|gaged, ran about the world rhiming, with a view to redeem his pawned patrimony. Nor did he want encouragement. From &s;ome he received arms, from others flags; here cloaths, and there hor&s;es; nay, very often, money; and to render the recompen&s;e of per&s;ons of quality more wor|thy the acceptance of the nobleman di&s;gui&s;ed as a &s;troller, the great ladies, even to prince&s;&s;es, joined their favours.<P>"But if we are a&s;toni&s;hed that, in a nation like FRANCE, where letters have ever been de&s;pi&s;ed, and where we are not yet emancipated from this barbarity, gentlemen and noblemen have for|merly amu&s;ed them&s;elves with writing poetry, I

don't know what el&s;e to an&s;wer but that it was poetry written without genius, without &s;tudy, without &s;cience, and, therefore, &s;uch as will not di&s;honour nobility."</P></Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this plea&s;antry of FONTENELLE, and his kind concern le&s;t the ance&s;tors of the FRENCH nobility &s;hould have written good poetry, and, therefore, di&s;honoured their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, no|thing can be more certain than that per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank, in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries, made this amu&s;ement their principal occupation.</P>
<P>We find among the number, &s;o early as the year 1100, WILLIAM the Ninth, Count of POITOU, who knew not only how to write ver&s;es, but to &s;ing them afterwards; and who was &s;o witty and &s;o plea&s;ant a companion as con&s;tantly to keep the table in a roar. This talent was &s;o natural to him that at his return from the fir&s;t cru&s;ade, in which he was far from being fortunate, he &s;ung the fatigues and dangers of that expedition in a poem &s;o full of vivacity that it was con&s;idered both as a ju&s;t ridicule of that &s;trange war, as far as he had wit+ne&s;&s;ed it, and a deprecation of its di&s;graceful, ca+ta&s;trophe. In 1102, the famous father ABELARD, who was of a noble family, and who&s;e talents and

<P>In 1152, BERTRAND&mdash;who was attached to the COUNT DE VENTADOUR, and afterwards to ELEO|NORE DE GUIENNE wife of LOUIS the Seventh of FRANCE, who married and was divorced from the duke of NORMANDY, &s;ince king of ENGLAND by the name of HENRY the Second&mdash;This BERTRAND, who&s;e elogium has been given us by PETRARCH, was one of the mo&s;t celebrated poets of his time. He encouraged the trouverres and wrote for them.</P>
<P>From this period to the year twelve hundred we find a long li&s;t of noble per&s;onages, who both coun|tenanced the&s;e &s;ort of performances and a&s;&s;i&s;ted them as authors and actors. Among the&s;e are the names of the emperor FREDERIC, the dauphin

D'AUVERGNE, the Dominican Mi&s;&s;ionary, and Inqui|&s;itor IZARN, the chevalier SORDEL, who was over|whelmed with benefits by St. BONIFACE, and mar|ried BEATRICE, through which marriage he was con|nected with a &s;tring of Italian nobility, the count of VENTADOUR, the counte&s;s DE DYE, and RICHARD COEUR DE LION, who all compo&s;ed and cultivated poetry.</P>
<P>During the next century the number of poets were &s;till more numerous, and not le&s;s re&s;pectable. Among the&s;e were FOUQUET, bi&s;hop of MAR|SEILLES, and afterwards archbi&s;hop of TOULOUSE, GUILLAUME DE CABESTAN, who peri&s;hed a victim to the jealou&s;y of RAYMOND CASSEL DE ROUS|SILLON DE SEILHANS, to whom he was page, ANSELME FAIDIT, an author and compo&s;er, of who&s;e writings and emoluments BEAUCHAMP en|larges a good deal, RAIMOND BERENGER, count of PROVENCE and of FORCALQUIER, &s;on of AL|PHONSO, king of ARRAGON, who married BEA|TRICE, &s;i&s;ter of THOMAS, count of SAVOY, by whom he had four daughters, who were all married to kings. MARGARITE to LOUIS the Ninth, king of FRANCE, ELENORA to HENRY the Third, king of ENGLAND, SANCHE to RICHARD, king of the Romans, and BEATRICE, declared by her father heire&s;s to the county of PROVENCE, to CHARLES,

brother to St. LOUIS, who was crowned king of NAPLES and the two SICILIES; GASPER DE PUYCIBOT, a great mu&s;ician, and who performed on many &s;orts of in&s;truments in great perfection; SORDEL MANTOUAN, in who&s;e works was mixed much moral in&s;truction; PIERRE AUVERGNE, a mu&s;ician and a poet; ALBERT, marquis of MALA|SPINA; and LE SEIGNEUR BERTRAND D'ALLA|MANON, one of the mo&s;t learned men of tho&s;e times, who dedicated his works to ESTEPHANETTE DE ROMANIN, of the family of GANTELME, and aunt to the celebrated LARUA SADO, mi&s;tre&s;s of PETRARCH. BERTRAND was greatly e&s;teemed and patronized by ROBERT, king of NAPLES, and count of PROVENCE, who was called the Father of the provincial poets.</P>
<P>In the 1306, appeared PIERRE CARDINAL, a man of great talents, who wrote poetry in &s;everal languages. The town of TARASCAN a&s;&s;igned him &s;everal con&s;iderable appointments for his trouble in in&s;tructing youths, who, under him, made great progre&s;s in learning. He was con&s;idered by the great as a man proper to be tru&s;ted with commi&s;&s;ions of con&s;equence, and, among the re&s;t, by BER|TRAND to prevail upon the prince&s;s BEATRICE, who had retired to the convent of NAZARETH at AIX, to quit her religious habits and appear like the
<PB N="190" REF="194">
daughter of a king; in which undertaking he ac|quitted him&s;elf &s;o well that he conducted her to NAPLES where &s;he married the marquis of EST.</P>
<P>During the next ten years many others made their appearance; and, in the year 1321, PHILIP the Long, count of POITOU, and afterwards king of FRANCE, became celebrated as a votary of the Mu&s;es. He was a prince of a mo&s;t enlightened un|der&s;tanding; his principal delight was to cultivate and protect literature, and, as a remarkable in&s;tance of it, he gave con&s;iderable appointments in his hou&s;ehold to ten of his dependants becau&s;e they were poets.</P>
<P>GEOFREY DE LUC, who e&s;tabli&s;hed an aca|demy, MADAME DE MARCHEBRUC, and her &s;on, ANSELME DE MOUSTIER, a great favourite of ROBERT, king of NAPLES, BERNARD ROSCAS, related to the Popes, CLEMENT, and INNOCENT the Sixth, and e&s;teemed a greater man than either, ARNAUD DE COUTIGNAC, who was e&s;teemed for his rare prudence, and remarkable for quelling a rebellion for the king of NAPLES, and many others made up the interval from 1320 to 1355, when LE MONGE appeared, who was called the &s;courge of the Troubadours on account of his writings. He fell mo&s;t unmercifully on the poets of his time,
<PB N="191" REF="195">
&s;paring neither friend, nor foe, nor per&s;ua&s;ion, nor condition; till, at length, he expo&s;ed the tyranny of &s;ome of the rulers in the provinces, and was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated for his pains.</P>
<P>LE MONGE, however did &s;ervice both to the cau&s;e of poetry and his country; &s;o much that TARAUDET, who &s;ucceeded him, and who wrote with equal &s;everity, but more policy, completely effected that reform his predece&s;&s;or had only medi|tated. TARAUDET was born a gentleman, and was bred a warrior as well as a poet. Being in treaty with FOULQUES DE PONTENAS for an e&s;tate, FOULQUES, being a great admirer of poetry, con|tented him&s;elf with giving him an ea&s;y bargain in con&s;equence of his dedicating to him a work called, <HI>A method to guard the heart again&s;t the treachery of love.</HI></P>
<P>TARAUDET being now rich and a nobleman, a&s;&s;embled the neighbouring nobility and purged PROVENCE of all tho&s;e petty tyrants that had &s;o long de&s;olated it.</P>
<P>After the&s;e, BOYER, a mathematician, and who as well as poetry wrote on natural hi&s;tory, meteoro|logy, hydraulics and botany, JEAN DE MEUN, a famous theologi&s;t, philo&s;opher, a&s;tronomi&s;t, chymi&s;t,
<PB N="192" REF="196">
arithmetician, and, above all, a poet, and the il|lu&s;trious LOUIS DE LASCARIS, count DE VINTI|MILLE, celebrated for his talents and his valour when the Normands and the Engli&s;h ravaged PRO|VENCE, were at the head of literature in FRANCE; till, about 1375, when BERENGER DE PARASOLS gave a new turn to dramatic poetry, having, it is &s;aid, compo&s;ed five regular tragedies.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e tragedies there is &s;o particular an ac|count that it is difficult to &s;u&s;pect the truth of his having written them. They have all appropriate names, and the matter of which they are compo&s;ed con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ts of &s;atyric particulars relative to the mar|riages of princes and prince&s;&s;es of tho&s;e times. BERENGER, according to the&s;e authorities, dedi|cated his tragedies to Pope CLEMENT the Seventh, who recompenced him with a prebendary of PARA|SOL, where BEAUCHAMP tells us he ended his days, but PARFAICT &s;ays he was poi&s;oned on account of the truths contained in his tragedies, which FON|TENELLE &s;eems to confirm by hinting that JOAN of NAPLES, hated PARASOLS for having expo&s;ed, in one of his pieces, the circum&s;tance of her &s;trangling her hu&s;band that &s;he might marry one &s;he thought more amiable.</P>
<P>There is rea&s;on to believe, that though the&s;e
<PB N="193" REF="197">
pieces were called regular they approach very little towards that di&s;tinction in the &s;en&s;e we under&s;tand it now, being no more than &s;atires in dialogue, and di&s;tingui&s;hed in nothing from tho&s;e of DANIEL in 1189, and FAIDIT, in 1220, except in their &s;tyle.</P>
<P>The&s;e poets, together with RICHARD DE BAR|BEZIEUX, who joined to poetry rhetoric, theology, and mathematics, and Father BONIFACE, related to the mo&s;t ancient nobility in PROVENCE, and re|markable for his attachment to JOAN of NAPLES, and con&s;equently an enemy of PARASOLS, were the principal among a very large number that made up the literati of the fourteenth century.</P>
<P>In 1408 lived another LE MONGE, from who&s;e information, through different channels, are fur|ni&s;hed the preceding particulars. He was made librarian of the mona&s;tery of LERINS, of which &s;o|ciety he was a member. In the library under his care, which it is &s;aid contained a prodigious number of books, he carefully collected the lives and la|bours of the provincial poets. The&s;e materials he was &s;o particular in arranging and dige&s;ting, that his authority has been con&s;tantly con&s;idered as au|thentic, e&s;pecially that edition of it corrected and improved by St. CEZARI in 1435.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="198">After this period, to enumerate all tho&s;e poets that pa&s;s in review upon enquiry, would give this work the air of a catalogue rather than a hi&s;tory. More than three hundred names might be &s;et down that different authors have thought it worth while to celebrate.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e lived in the court of TIBALD, where they formed an a&s;&s;embly for the purpo&s;e of examining one anothers works after the manner of that &s;chool of poetry fir&s;t in&s;tituted by GEOFREY DE LUC in 1340, and carried into greater perfection by BERTRAND DE PEZARS in 1348; and which may be con&s;idered as the foundation of the French academy, afterwards &s;o celebrated; though not its origin, for CHARLEMAGNE e&s;tabli&s;hed an academy for &s;cience and literature in general on his return from ITALY in 781.</P>
<P>The&s;e names make but a part, as we are told, though one &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e a con&s;iderable part of the principal inventors, as they are called, or poets in FRANCE; and the &s;urrounding nations and pro|vinces, where the French language was either cor|rectly or imperfectly &s;poken. The principal &s;ervice the&s;e authors have rendered to the cau&s;e of literature is in leaving us an idea of the manner of tho&s;e
<PB N="195" REF="199">
times in which they lived; but the&s;e were &s;o bar|barous and unpoli&s;hed, that their labours &s;erve more to point out what ought to be avoided than what ought to be imitated as far as it relates to their choice of &s;ubjects; and, if we &s;hould go further and fairly look into their works as an object of critici&s;m, though we &s;hould find anecdotes and &s;hort hi&s;tories recounted with neatne&s;s and &s;implicity, and remarka|ble for the truth of their images, and the elegance of their &s;tyle; yet the gro&s;s indecency, the barbarity, and crudene&s;s of the re&s;t, would render the ta&s;k of &s;election &s;carcely worth the pains; of &s;o little value would be the gold, after it were extracted from the filthy concrete in which it is enveloped.</P>
<P>This chapter ought not to be fini&s;hed without a notice that it is impo&s;&s;ible, from the contradictions of various authors, to be correct to a year, or, per|haps, to twenty years, as to when the&s;e poets wrote. The &s;ame circum&s;tance is frequently related dif|ferently, and &s;ometimes one circum&s;tance is mi&s;taken for another. For one in&s;tance, among many others, the four daughters of BERENGER, Count of PRO|VENCE, it is agreed upon on all hands, married four kings, but one author will in&s;i&s;t upon it, that one of the hu&s;bands was RICHARD COEUR DE LION, who, by the way, was dead before the thirteenth century,
<PB N="196" REF="200">
and another fixes the time of the birth of BEREN|GER at the year 1245, which is impo&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e HENRY the Third married his daughter in the year 1536. The fir&s;t mi&s;take originates, perhaps, from the name of BERENGARIA the wife of RICHARD, and the other from making 1245 the time of BE|RENGER's birth, in&s;tead of the time he was cele|brated as a poet.</P>
<P>As the&s;e circum&s;tances concern literature it&s;elf but very little, I &s;hall always, where I find no ma|terial contradiction, &s;et down events, as they are related, leaving it to the di&s;cretion and good &s;en&s;e of the reader to di&s;tingui&s;h between what appears to be merely probable and what po&s;itively authentic.</P>

The French and Engli&s;h fought again&s;t, and, of cour&s;e, beat the Saracens, in pre&s;ence of the queen. All the &s;treets were laid with carpets, &s;everal fountains were placed in different &s;ituations, which ran with wine and other delicious liquors, and upon lofty &s;tages erected for the purpo&s;e, were placed choirs of mu&s;icians, organs, and youths who repre&s;ented different parts of the ancient te&s;ta|ment.</P>
<P>Machines were contrived, by means of which infants, dre&s;&s;ed to repre&s;ent angels, de&s;cended and placed flowers and ornaments on the head of the queen; but the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing part of the &s;pec|tacles was the intrepidity of a man who glided down by a cord from the &s;pire of NOTRE DAME to the bridge where the queen was to pa&s;s, and placed a crown upon her head, which having ef|fected, he returned by the way he came, as if a&s;cend|ing to heaven.

In one of the&s;e was placed a bark with the &s;ails furled, in which was &s;een a chevalier armed <HI>cap a pie.</HI> Be|fore the bark was placed a &s;ilver &s;wan with a golden collar and chain, with which it &s;eemed to tow the ve&s;&s;el along, and near at hand a ca&s;tle appeared to ri&s;e out of the waves on which a falcon was perched.</P>
<P>The&s;e different objects were emblematic of a trait of ancient hi&s;tory relative to the hou&s;e of CLEVES, in which it is reported that a &s;wan tra|ver&s;ing the RHINE, led, miraculou&s;ly to the ca&s;tle of that family, a chevalier, celebrated by his ex|ploits, who became the hu&s;band of the prince&s;s of the country, and gave an heir to that ancient and illu&s;trious hou&s;e, who&s;e title would otherwi&s;e have become extinct.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year, when MAHOMET the Second, menaced CONSTANTINOPLE, the emperor CON|STANTINE,

the la&s;t chri&s;tian prince that reigned in the Ea&s;t, demanded &s;uccour from all the princes of his religion; and, among others, from PHILIP the Good, then duke of BURGUNDY. PHILIP flattered with this attention, replied o&s;tentatiou&s;ly to CON|STANTINE, that he &s;hould prepare a cru&s;ade him|&s;elf. And to effect this he in&s;tantly a&s;&s;embled his provincial generals, and the commanders of his ve&s;&s;els, to whom he gave a grand fea&s;t, at which was performed a magnificent <HI>entremets.</HI></P>
<P>Among the different objects introduced in this a&s;toni&s;hing entertainment was a church filled with &s;ingers, who&s;e voices were accompanied by bells; a ve&s;&s;el fitted with all &s;orts of merchandi&s;e; a &s;uperb fountain, with ornaments in gla&s;s and lead &s;o wonderfully con&s;tructed as to repre&s;ent trees, flowers, verdure, &s;tones of all colours, and a figure of St. ANDREW with his cro&s;s, from which i&s;&s;ued a fountain which fell at his feet and lo&s;t it&s;elf in a beautiful declivity covered with flowers; and an enormous pie which repre&s;ented a ca&s;tle and con|cealed eight mu&s;icians. On the battlements of the ca&s;tle was &s;een a &s;erpent, and at the ba&s;e were two fountains, from which i&s;&s;ued orange flower water which filled the fo&s;&s;es.</P>

<P>Then came a view of a de&s;ert; a tyger &s;ight|ing with a &s;erpent; a &s;avage upon a camel; a pea&s;ant beating the bu&s;hes from which flew a thou+&s;and birds; a chevalier entertaining his dulcinea under a hedge of ro&s;es; a &s;atyr mocking a &s;hep+herde&s;s cro&s;&s;ed in love; a madman upon the back of a bear; and a number of other &s;trange and in|congruous objects.</P>
<P>In another place was a lake &s;urrounded with villages and ca&s;tles; and further off an impervious fore&s;t embelli&s;hed with oriental trees, and filled with a croud of animals of every kind &s;o natural that they &s;eemed alive. In a niche were placed va&s;es of gold enriched with precious &s;tones, where &s;at the figure of a woman made out of the &s;ame ma|terials, from who&s;e nipples i&s;&s;ued a delicious be|verage; a lion was placed by her &s;ide chained to a column, on which was written, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Touch not the lady.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP III. DESCRIPTION OF THE MYSTERIES.</HEAD>
<P>IN proportion as chivalry left FRANCE for the HOLY LAND, &s;o a ta&s;te for the entremets &s;ell off; and, when the knights of the cro&s;s returned from JERUSALEM, they were &s;o full of adventures that the prie&s;ts thought they could not do better than turn tho&s;e adventures to the advantage of the church, or rather of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious, however, that a mere relation of that mad bu&s;ine&s;s would have but a di&s;gracious effect, they &s;oon cea&s;ed to &s;ing the exploits of kingly prie&s;ts and &s;acerdotal generals, and contented them&s;elves with acting &s;acred hi&s;tory, and per&s;onifying divine characters.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e they formed them&s;elves into a &s;ociety, but not being rich enough to buy ground, much le&s;s to build a theatre on it, they fir&s;t made pro&s;elytes of &s;ome of the mo&s;t opulent trade&s;men
<PB N="207" REF="211">
in PARIS, and afterwards had the conde&s;cen&s;ion to accept of their money and property, by which means they carried their &s;cheme into execution.</P>
<P>They cho&s;e for their &s;cene of action the Bourg of St. MAUR DES-FOSSES near PARIS, which had been rendered celebrated by the number of pulgrims who re&s;orted there from motives of devotion. The fir&s;t my&s;tery that was performed by this &s;ociety was called <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the Death of our Saviour,</HI> and from this circum&s;tance they gave them&s;elves the name of <HI>The Confraternity of the Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The followers of this &s;pecies of amu&s;ement were, as we are told, in number beyond all belief. Bu&s;i|ne&s;s was &s;o at a &s;tand, and every public concern neglected for the plea&s;ure of running after this no|velty to &s;uch a degree, that, in 1298, the pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t of the capital i&s;&s;ued an interdiction to &s;uppre&s;s the pious farces of the&s;e holy actors. The intere&s;t of the prie&s;ts however was paramount to that of the pr&eacute;v&ocirc;t; nay the interference of that magi&s;trate was ultimately of &s;ervice to them; for, upon petitioning the king to take off the interdiction, they were invited to per|form before him, and he was &s;o delighted with the poetry and the acting, that, in 1402, he e&s;tabli&s;hed them at PARIS by his own letters patent, after which it was even fa&s;hionable to become members
<PB N="208" REF="212">
of this fraternity; for we find that &s;everal of the king's hou&s;ehold, nay, the king him&s;elf, did not di&s;dain to make a part of the company.</P>
<P>The ho&s;pital of the trinity, which had been founded in 1100 for the reception of pilgrims, was now converted into a theatre for the repre&s;en|tation of the&s;e my&s;teries. The theatre was won|derfully well con&s;tructed for the purpo&s;e of giving effect to the performances. The front was much in the &s;tyle of ours, but the &s;tage was upon a very dif|ferent principal, being intended to convey an idea of all objects as truly as it was po&s;&s;ible to exhibit them. Heaven, earth, and hell were their three principal objects, which they contrived to repre&s;ent with great facility. If the &s;cene was to be heaven, convolutions of clouds to an immen&s;e height and ex|tent &s;urrounded the &s;tage, on which angels appeared flying or walking as it be&s;t &s;uited to carry on the amu&s;ement; if earth, the extremity of the theatre &s;eemed an immen&s;e expan&s;e, on which, at proper di&s;tances, objects appeared as in nature; and, if hell, the whole &s;tage was lifted up like the jaw of a mon&s;trous dragon repre&s;enting a tremendous aby&s;s, and out of the mouth, which vomited fire, came le|gions of devils.</P>
<P>Though the Pa&s;&s;ion of our Saviour was the fir&s;t
<PB N="209" REF="213">
piece performed by this fraternity, which very po&s;&s;ibly was originally written many hundred years before, for no one has pretended to name the author of it, three cotemporary poets of the thirteenth century, who&s;e writings were depo&s;ited among the manu&s;cripts of CHARLES the Sixth, &s;eem to have furni&s;hed the materials for this brotherhood to work upon.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e poets were called RUTEBEUF, BODEL, and ADAM DE LA HALLE; and, among the mo&s;t celebrated of their pieces, which were all my&s;teries, we find <HI>The Prodigal Son, The Miracle of Theophilus, The Cru&s;ades,</HI> and <HI>St. Nicholas, and The Children in the Tub.</HI> The&s;e three poets had their imitators to the number of fifty or &s;ixty, &s;ome ve&s;tiges of who&s;e works we have imperfect accounts of. They con|&s;i&s;t of &s;ubjects from &s;cripture put into action, and contain, among a heap of rubbi&s;h, &s;ome literary jewels of con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to deny that the&s;e writers were &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a true knowledge of the dra|matic art; for, where the &s;ubjects, though &s;criptural, are purely dome&s;tic and &s;imple, and have no re|ference to religion beyond fair and naked morality, we find for &s;uch times many of the requi&s;ites that
<PB N="210" REF="214">
compo&s;e a regular piece calculated to convey amu&s;ement and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e is, <HI>The Prodigal Son,</HI> written by RUTEBEUF, &s;o early as 1240. A &s;tory, which if we dive&s;t our&s;elves for a moment of having read it in the New Te&s;tament as a parable, has nothing to do with religion in any other re&s;pect than as it is a beautiful le&s;&s;on of morality.</P>
<P>RUTEBEUF chu&s;es to throw into, his piece all the nature and &s;implicity he po&s;&s;ibly can; and, therefore, feigning to forget, or really forgetting that his bu&s;ine&s;s was to write a religious my&s;tery, he places his &s;cene in a beautiful country, and makes his characters opulent labourers, a people of all others, who are naturally &s;trangers to artificial as well as real want.</P>
<P>Thus in the Prodigal Son has he given a mo&s;t beautiful picture of the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of human nature. Ble&s;t with health and &s;trength, and a&s;&s;ured of every rational ble&s;&s;ing for only the trouble of earning it&mdash;and what bread is &s;o &s;weet as that we earn&mdash;He makes it the bu&s;ine&s;s of his life to run counter to rea&s;on. He torments his father in return for his unbounded indulgence, and hates his brother be|cau&s;e
<PB N="211" REF="215">
he is good and dutiful; till, at length, he demands his patrimony and determines to &s;eek his fortune.</P>
<P>Turned loo&s;e in that world of who&s;e inhabitants and manners he has no knowledge, the prodigal &s;on is not more delighted and a&s;toni&s;hed than he is a&s;hamed and confounded. The compliments he re|ceives on his wit, his grace, and his good &s;en&s;e, though he knows them to be fal&s;e he admits as if they were true. Nay, he begins at la&s;t to fancy him|&s;elf perfectly accompli&s;hed; and, under this idea, is more angry with his father and his brother than ever, who wanted him to con&s;ider him&s;elf as a clown and to linger out his life in ob&s;curity. But the de|lu&s;ion does not la&s;t long. He goes to an inn where the landlord and waiters fly at his orders. A lady enters, he falls in love with her, the dinner is &s;erved, wine and mu&s;ic &s;ucceed, in the mid&s;t of which an|other lady is introduced, and he has the inexpre&s;&s;i|ble plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him&s;elf an object of con|tention between the two ladies. He appea&s;es them, and a&s;&s;ures them he is in love with them both. By this time they, beginning to be tired with their farce, or rather intere&s;ted in bringing on the de|nouement, make him drunk as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, pick his pockets, &s;hare the booty with the landlord, and
<PB N="212" REF="216">
decamp, leaving him a&s;leep. He afterwards wakes, di&s;covers his lo&s;s, and while he is raving about like one di&s;tracted, the landlord brings the bill, and finding his gue&s;t has no money kicks him out of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>We next &s;ee the prodigal &s;on a beggar on the highway. His mi&s;eries have now made him contrite, and he recals to his mind with tears the indulgence and the advice of his father. He thinks of his bro|ther, who by indu&s;try and frugality is in abundance, while he through his profligacy is &s;tarving for want. In this wretched plight a pea&s;ant touched with his misfortunes takes him to his hovel and &s;ets him to take care of his pigs. In this &s;ituation he has time for reflection, and at length his repentance is con|firmed, when he re&s;olves to return to his father, who receives him with tenderne&s;s, and the reconciliation takes place exactly as in the parable.</P>
<P>We have here a regular piece. This is no my&s;tery from &s;cripture. It is plain &s;elf evident morality. It is a picture of human life &s;uch as it ever has been and ever will be; and, as to the poetical requi&s;ites, it is full of them. It con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;ingle fable, &s;imple, and grand. It has beginning, middle, and end; and there is not a circum&s;tance throughout the whole but inculcates &s;ome moral
<PB N="213" REF="217">
in&s;truction. It is true RUTEBEUF does not &s;eem to have read ARISTOTLE, but he had read nature, which an&s;wered his purpo&s;e better; and, if other authors had paid the &s;cripture no wor&s;e a compli|ment than bringing it on the &s;tage with &s;o fair and &s;o hone&s;t a motive&mdash;for what &s;tore can we &s;o properly &s;earch to find moral in&s;truction&mdash;the my&s;teries &s;o far from profaning &s;cripture, would have honoured it.</P>
<P>As far as the&s;e my&s;teries were con&s;idered as a vehicle for poetry, there is &s;omething in them awful and maje&s;tic. To give an idea of this let us turn our thoughts to MILTON's Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, and then &s;uppo&s;e this poem put into dialogue, and acted on the &s;tage; which is the &s;tronge&s;t ca&s;e in point that can be imagined. What would be the con&s;equence? The characters, which, while the reader's fancy is fired with the glowing imagery of the poet, are &s;a|cred and &s;ublime, would &s;ink into the mo&s;t mi&s;erable burle&s;que if attempted to be per&s;onified; and this bathos would be &s;till more complete in proportion to the beauty of the poetry.</P>
<P>Fortunately, though to be &s;ure it is a left handed advantage, there was very little in the poetry of the&s;e my&s;teries to drive it into any &s;uch predicament. It was mi&s;erable enough, GOD knows; but, in return, that the prie&s;ts might be &s;ure to incur their rightful
<PB N="214" REF="218">
portion of reprehen&s;ion, the matter was not only the mo&s;t &s;acred that could be cho&s;en, but the mo&s;t dangerous to expo&s;e to ridicule; for when we con|&s;ider that &s;uch &s;ubjects were performed on the &s;tage as the Conception of the Virgin MARY, the Pa&s;&s;ion of CHRIST, and the Re&s;urrection, the mind is of|fended to a degree of outrage, and we condemn that country where &s;uch an impiety was tolerated, and tho&s;e prie&s;ts who connived at it.</P>
<P>The my&s;tery of the Conception is compo&s;ed in fifty three acts, di&s;tributed hi&s;torically, and traced all the way from the prophecy of ISAIAH, to the death of the Innocents; and, without mentioning the choru&s;&s;es, has at lea&s;t a hundred characters.</P>
<P>To go over the plot would be to reiterate all we have read on the &s;ubject in the New Te&s;tament, which is on the &s;tage tediou&s;ly &s;pun out in four feet ver&s;e, with now and their a few awkward Alexan|drines, perpetually fi&s;hing for the &s;ublime, and catching the bathos. The joy of the human race on the coming of the MESSIAH is truly poetical; &s;o is the di&s;comfiture of the devils; but if it had not been larded with the jokes of the landlord of the inn at BETHELEM, who is very facecious with MARY about the groaning, and the devils putting new bolts and bars upon limbo for fear our SAVIOUR &s;hould
<PB N="215" REF="219">
let out ADAM and EVE, it would not have been &s;ea&s;oned to the palates of the prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>The je&s;ts al&s;o of tho&s;e who are employed by HEROD to murder the Innocents with the leave of the holy fathers, might as well have been &s;pared; nor can we forgive the devils, after they have tempted HEROD with &s;o many flattering promi&s;es of reward, for in&s;tigating him to cut his throat, and afterwards kicking his &s;oul about till they are tired, and then enjoying the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing it bubble in a &s;urnace of molten lead.</P>
<P>There are a hundred other ab&s;urdities, the milde&s;t epithet that can be given them, and yet this &s;trange incongruous farago is excelled in point of impiety, meant for &s;anctity, in the Pa&s;&s;ion, which begins with a &s;ermon by way of prologue; and yet more in the Re&s;urrection, which fini&s;hes with a figure dance between ADAM, EVE, ISAIAH, JERE|MIAH, JOHN the Bapti&s;t, the Good Thief crucified with CHRIST, and an immen&s;e number of other &s;ouls, whom the coming of the MESIAH had li|berated from limbo.</P>

<P>ARNOT GREBAN, canon of MANS, wrote the my&s;tery of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles. The title ran thus:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Triumphant My&s;tery of Catholic Works in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles taken from St. LUKE, evangeli&s;t and hi&s;toriographer."</Q>
Another of the&s;e curious pieces was called the Hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament&mdash;This was the title,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Old Te&s;tament, in which is &s;hewn how the children of ISRAEL pa&s;&s;ed the Red Sea and reached the Land of Promi&s;e, with &s;everal other hi&s;tories &s;uch as JOB, TOBIT, DANIEL, SUSANNAH, and HESTER."</Q></P>

<P>This piece no more re&s;embled a tragedy than any of the preceding ones; but it appeared at a time when the my&s;teries began to tire.

The my&s;te|ries, which formerly took each of them four days in the performance, began now to be con&s;iderably compre&s;&s;ed; and, wherever any familiar circum|&s;tances occurred, they were con&s;idered as properer for the &s;tage than tho&s;e more &s;acred &s;ubjects which were profaned enough by the ceremonies of the

Nay, it is not very clear that the authors, who were now principally laical, did not attempt as far as they &s;afely could to burle&s;que the&s;e holy &s;ub|jects, by way of bringing them into contempt; for we find about this time &s;uch titles as <HI>The Joyous My&s;tery of the Three Kings;</HI> and <HI>The Plea&s;ant con|ceit of the Apocalyp&s;e of St. John of Zebadee,</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. DESCRIPTION OF THE MORALITIES AND OTHER ENTERTAINMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THE tragedy of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and another called <HI>The Di&s;comfiture of the Giant Goliah,</HI> &s;eem to have &s;truck hard at the my&s;teries in FRANCE; for, en|couraged by the fir&s;t effort at innovation, there &s;hortly appeared a piece with the following title: <HI>The My&s;tery of the De&s;truction of Troy the Great.</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Rape of HELEN, done by PARIS, and com|po&s;ed in good French rhime; together with the prowe&s;s, the virtues, and the noblene&s;s of the va|liant HECTOR; the damnable trea&s;on committed by the Greeks, and many other hi&s;tories con|taining all the tran&s;actions between the Trojans and the Grecians."</Q></P>
<P>This heathen my&s;tery excited as much curio&s;ity as had the religious tragedy: Curio&s;ity begat con|trover&s;y; and, the &s;chi&s;m once &s;own, e&s;pecially as it had rea&s;on to nouri&s;h it, the my&s;teries were quite at a &s;tand. At la&s;t the prie&s;ts yielded with the be&s;t grace they could, and the general title of pieces for
<PB N="221" REF="225">
the theatre no longer a&s;&s;umed the term my&s;tery, but morality.</P>
<P>It was difficult, however, to draw a line as a cri|terion for the regulation of &s;o wide a field; and, therefore, the &s;ubjects were &s;ometimes holy, and &s;ometimes profane; but, as their general tendency was morality, every thing was permitted.</P>
<P>A Pilot, by name JOHN PARMENTIER, &s;up|po&s;ed to be the fir&s;t european who ever &s;et foot in AFRICA, wrote a morality in honour of the A&s;|&s;umption; a Cardinal wrote a choice morality called <HI>The Reformation of Taverns and Alehou&s;es, and the De&s;truction of Gluttony;</HI> and the Valet de Chambre of LOUIS the Twelfth, wrote a morality which he called <HI>The Ju&s;t Man, and the Man of this World,</HI> by which he meant the per&s;onification of virtue and vice; and he &s;o completely wound up his plot, that the ju&s;t man was &s;ent fir&s;t to purgatory and afterwards to heaven, while the devils ran away with the &s;oul of the man of this world.</P>
<P>A phy&s;ician, of an hone&s;ter ca&s;t than the phy|&s;icians afterwards ridiculed by MOLIERE, wrote three moralities, entitled, <HI>The Road to Health, The Government of the Human Frame,</HI> and <HI>A Prohibition of an Indulgence of the pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="226">LOUISA L'ABB&Eacute;, born at LYONS, and called the French Sappho, at the age of fifteen followed her lover in men's cloaths to the &s;iege of PE PIG|NAN; and, afterwards, when &s;he had returned and married the man of her heart, wrote a morality called <HI>The Folly of Love.</HI> She is &s;aid to have written poetry in four languages, and her hou&s;e was a &s;ort of academy for the literati of her time.</P>
<P>But the Prodigal Son of RUTEBEUF became now the great object of imitation. It was per|formed with material alterations, and it produced as many imitations of it as there were in ENGLAND of the <HI>Beggar's Opera.</HI> Scarcely an in&s;tance of filial piety or ingratitude could be invented but pre|&s;ently it was brought on the &s;tage in the &s;hape of a morality. The &s;ubjects of one or two are worth attending to.</P>
<P><HI>The Poor Villager,</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"written in prai&s;e and honour of hone&s;t girls,"</Q>
made its appearance the year after the Prodigal Son was revived. The &s;tory is brief. A &s;eigneur of a village endeavours to corrupt his va&s;&s;al's daughter; and finding all his arts u&s;ele&s;s, is determined to have recour&s;e to vio|lence. In this &s;ituation, the poor girl promi&s;es to con&s;ent upon condition previou&s;ly of &s;peaking to her father. The lord &s;u&s;picious of every thing is
<PB N="223" REF="227">
determined to overhear the conver&s;ation, and hav|ing effected his &s;cheme without her knowledge, he is witne&s;s to her imploring her father, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to cut off her head rather than let her cha&s;tity be violated. Struck with remor&s;e the lord entreats her forgivene&s;s, gives her and her fa|ther their freedom, and loads them with benefits.</P>
<P>Another has for its title, <HI>The Ungrateful Son,</HI> who is &s;o completely the darling of his parents that they ab&s;olutely ruin them&s;elves to make his fortune. After a time they are overwhelmed with poverty, and he is rolling in riches; and, when they have recour&s;e to him as the only benefactor they know where to fly to, he treats them mo&s;t wantonly unnatural, not even permitting them, though they are &s;tarving, to eat of a repa&s;t on which he is fea&s;ting. The father, &s;eeing him treat the mo|ther contemptuou&s;ly, can forbear no longer; but, lifting his hands and eyes to heaven, cur&s;es him and implores the vengeance of GOD upon his head. Scarcely has he uttered this cur&s;e but a mon&s;trous toad comes out of a pye and flies at his face which it completely covers, attaching it&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely that no human art can remove it. The unnatural &s;on begins now to relent, and the parents, too ready to forgive, li&s;ten to his contrition. He is, however, in|formed that prayer alone can expiate his guilt;
<PB N="224" REF="228">
they, therefore, &s;end him about from prie&s;t to prie&s;t, afterwards to the bi&s;hop, and at la&s;t to the pope; and, by the time he has expended almo&s;t his whole fortune, he is relieved by exorci&s;m and exhortation from the frightful reptile and reconciled to his parents.</P>
<P>This piece was followed by another called <HI>The Morality of the Child of Perdition,</HI> <Q REND="inline">"who killed his father, hanged his mother, and afterwards went mad."</Q> But the&s;e in&s;tances are enough to &s;hew the di&s;|tinction between the my&s;teries and the moralities; which were the only regular dramatic attractions of the times. We are erroneou&s;ly informed that the clerks of the Bazoche e&s;tabli&s;hed a theatre where the beauty of virtue, and the hideou&s;ne&s;s of vice were per&s;onified; but the fact is that the&s;e clerks were no more than the laymen who gave the fir&s;t blow to the my&s;teries, and who afterwards, in con|junction, or rather by the connivance of the prie&s;ts, performed the moralities at the e&s;tabli&s;hed theatre, the prie&s;ts being too cunning to &s;hut out any op|portunity of bol&s;tering up their own reputation, which at that time began to decline.</P>
<P>We are told of a theatrical &s;ociety called <HI>Les En&s;ans de Sans Souci;</HI> but the&s;e cannot be re|gularly cla&s;&s;ed, being no more than a number of
<PB N="225" REF="229">
young men of fortune and family who ran after plea&s;ure, and &s;tuck at nothing to procure it. In con&s;equence of pur&s;uing this career many of them were ruined; and, having talents, they turned their thoughts to the &s;tage for a livelihood. They were many of them &s;cholars; and, being out of humour with the world, they walked in the foot&s;teps of ARISTOPHANES, and in their pieces la&s;hed the manners of their time.</P>
<P>This new &s;pecies of amu&s;ement &s;ucceeded, and the intere&s;t of the Confraternity began again to be menaced. The&s;e children of Sans Souci were, therefore, invited to join the regular theatre in the &s;ame manner as the brotherhood had invited the morali&s;ts; and thus, this in&s;atiate vortex, from which, perhaps, originated the idea of the Par&s;on's Barn, &s;wallowed up every thing that came in its way. The &s;tage, however, having gradually gone from my&s;teries to moralities, from moralities to farces, from farces to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t buffooneries, and very frequently a mixture of them all, the government took away the theatre from the confraternity, and in the year 1539, the hou&s;e of the trinity became an ho&s;pital according to its original in&s;titution.</P>
<P>FRANCIS the Fir&s;t having accorded the bro|therhood, letters patent confirming all the privileges they enjoyed under CHARLES the Sixth, they now
<PB N="226" REF="230">
&s;ought for &s;ome new place of e&s;tabli&s;hment; and, for that purpo&s;e, hired the Hotel de Flandres, where they performed four years; but the king ordered the demolition of this hotel, and &s;everal others near it, and our holy actors were as far to &s;eek as ever.</P>
<P>Tired with the con&s;iderable expences they had incurred by tran&s;porting their theatrical trappings from place to place, they re&s;olved to build upon their own foundation. They, therefore, bought &s;ome ground on which had &s;tood the hotel of the duke of BURGUNDY, and there they erected their fourth theatre, which con&s;i&s;ted of a hall and other edifices, many of which are now to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The parliament, upon &s;trong &s;olicitation, gave them permi&s;&s;ion to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves there upon condition they performed none but profane &s;ub|jects; but neverthele&s;s, &s;uch as tended to promote the practice of morality.</P>
<P><HI>The Confraternity of the Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> who profe&s;&s;ed piety, could not content them&s;elves with performing &s;ubjects purely profane, and, therefore, in the year 1588, they let their theatre to a troop of French comedians who had ju&s;t then formed, with a view of performing under the permi&s;&s;ion of the king. The pieces, now exhibited, began to be a little more
<PB N="227" REF="231">
&s;upportable than tho&s;e of the <HI>Confraternity of the Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> By degrees the public ta&s;te became more extended and more pure. Printing being invented in the reign of LOUIS the Ninth, and literature con&s;iderably more e&s;tabli&s;hed under FRANCIS the Fir&s;t, books, of cour&s;e, became common, different languages were generally learnt, and the&s;e improve|ments introduced tran&s;lations of the tragedies and comedies of the ancients.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP V. FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF TRAGEDY TO THE TIME OF HARDY.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH JODELLE is generally con&s;idered as the AESCHYLUS and the LIVIUS ANDRONICUS of FRANCE, yet the introduction of tragedy is cer|tainly owing to LAZARE BAIF, a gentleman of ANGEVIN, who was educated by the celebrated BUD&Eacute;. BAIF travelled to form his heart and his under&s;tanding. At ROME he &s;tudied Greek under the learned MUSURUS; and after he had accom|pli&s;hed every intelligence he thought nece&s;&s;ary for his purpo&s;e, he retired to his e&s;tate at ANJOU to lo&s;e him&s;elf in &s;tudy.</P>
<P>FRANCIS the Fir&s;t, however, unwilling that &s;uch talents &s;hould be lo&s;t to the world, drew him from ob&s;curity and &s;ent him amba&s;&s;ador to VENICE, where he fell in love with a young lady of condition, by whom he had &s;everal children. Returned to PARIS, he was promoted by the king to &s;ome honourable and lucrative &s;ituations, and the fir&s;t u&s;e
<PB N="229" REF="233">
he made of his learning was to tran&s;late &s;uch works as might be &s;erviceable to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k, however, in which he mo&s;t delighted was tran&s;lating SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES. The tragedy of <HI>Electra</HI> containing, according to its title, the inhuman and truly piteous death of AGAMEM|NON by his wicked wi&s;e CLYTEMNESTRA, and his cruel adulterer EGYSTHUS, was publi&s;hed at PARIS in the year 1537.</P>
<P>This tragedy that the French might clearly com|prehend the nature of Greek poetry, BAIF tran&s;lated ver&s;e for ver&s;e; con&s;equently the &s;tyle is barbarous enough. But he tran&s;lated afterwards the <HI>Hecuba</HI> of EURIPIDES in a more liberal manner, intending it for the edification of his children. It was printed in 1550, dedicated to HENRY the Second, and it is &s;poken of as an ingenious work.</P>
<P>THOMAS SIBILET, about the &s;ame time, pub|li&s;hed a tran&s;lation of the <HI>Iphigenia</HI> of EURIPIDES, and other authors are &s;poken of who emulated BAI<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. The French, neverthele&s;s, con&s;ider JODELLE as the founder of tragedy; for they &s;ay that the&s;e tran&s;lations only &s;erve to point out, at a di&s;tance, the road that dramatic writers ought to follow. But this is only general opinion. <Q REND="inline">"JODELLE,"</Q> &s;ays the
<PB N="230" REF="234">
duke de VALLIERE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was the fir&s;t who had the boldne&s;s to bring forward a tragedy of his own invention. It was called <HI>Cleopatra Captive,</HI> and publi&s;hed in 1552; but it was a &s;ervile imitation of the cut and form of the Greek theatre, and yet he has the glory to pa&s;s for the inventor of French tragedy."</Q>
But let us examine him.</P>
<P>ETIENNE JODELLE, lord of LIMODIN, was born at PARIS in 1532, of a family illu&s;trious both by birth and by talents. The delight he took in &s;tudying the works of the Greeks and the Romans, induced him to lament that the &s;tage had remained &s;o long in a barbarous &s;tate, and that &s;ome &s;uperior genius had not introduced SOPHOCLES and MENAN|DER, SENECA, and TERENCE, into FRANCE. But how to manage? The confraternity were too intent upon deceiving the people to con&s;ent to &s;uch a dra|matic revolution. JODELLE had influence, and having con&s;tructed his <HI>Cleopatra</HI> upon the Greek model, he procured a theatre to be prepared in the court-yard of the hotel of RHEIMS, where his tra|gedy was performed before HENRY the Second, and a large concour&s;e of &s;pectators, with the mo&s;t extra|vagant applau&s;e.</P>
<P>JODELLE, being then only twenty, and remarka|bly hand&s;ome, undertook to perform the part of
<PB N="231" REF="235">
Cleopatra. He al&s;o &s;poke the prologue, which was a compliment to the king, and in it he adroitly in|&s;inuated that the Mu&s;es, having flown from GREECE to FRANCE, implored the protection of &s;o great a monarch.</P>
<P>This piece is opened by the gho&s;t of ANTONY, who complains that the gods, jealous of his valour and glory when living, had connived with CUPID to render him a &s;lave to a pa&s;&s;ion that terminated his life; and, not contented with this, they had made him become odious to the Romans by pro|voking him to turn his wife and children out of doors. Since, however, matters are &s;o, this gho&s;t &s;eems determined to keep up the idea of all for love; and, therefore, appears to CLEOPATRA in a dream and advi&s;es her rather to kill her&s;elf than be led in triumph and chained to the chariot of CAESAR. The gho&s;t, out of regard, probably, to the rules of ARISTOTLE, enjoins her to meet him in the &s;hades in le&s;s than twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>The chorus, at the end of the fir&s;t act, &s;ing the in&s;tability of human wi&s;hes, the fall of TROY once &s;o glorious, the wretchedne&s;s of MEDEA at the lo&s;s of JASON; and, at length, advert to the ro&s;e that la&s;ts but a day, and apply their remarks to the unhappy fate of ANTONY and CLEOPATRA.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="236">In the &s;econd act, CAESAR enjoys the idea of CLEOPATRA's captivity. In the third he has an interview with CLEOPATRA, who threatens to kick him and he runs away. In the fourth &s;he kills her|&s;elf; and in the fifth they deplore her death. PRO|CULLUS exclaims
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Never did the light of heaven di&s;cover &s;o frightful a day for EGYPT. I found her,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in her royal habit and her crown, &s;tretched dead and pale, on a rich bed painted and gilt. ERAS, her woman, lay dead at her feet, CHARMION yet breathed, but life was leav|ing her. Was this nobly done?"</Q>
&s;aid I. <Q REND="inline">"Yes,"</Q> cried the faithful CHARMION,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was nobly done; and every &s;ucceeding king of EGYPT &s;hall bear te&s;timony of it. This &s;aid, &s;he &s;taggered, &s;ell, and died."</Q></P>
<P>I con&s;idered it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;o much of this tragedy as it was looked up to as the <HI>chef d'oeuvre</HI> of its time, and a model for every thing that was to &s;ucceed it. Its reception encouraged JODELLE to go on, and he &s;oon after produced <HI>The Sacrifice, of Dido,</HI> taken as clo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible from the Aeneid of VIRGIL, which had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s; and after that a comedy called <HI>Eugene; or the Rencoun|ter,</HI> which are &s;uppo&s;ed to make up the whole of his dramatic works, for they are printed, together with &s;ome mi&s;cellanies of his, in one volume in 1574.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="237">He appears, however, to have left behind him &s;omething more in manu&s;cript; for DE LA MOTTE &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have the tragedies and comedies of JO|DELLE in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ome fini&s;hed, &s;ome hung upon the hooks; the&s;e were commanded either by the queen, or madame, the king's &s;i&s;ter; but were deferred on account of the trouble&s;ome times."</Q>
DE LA MOTTE al&s;o &s;peaks of him as a man of univer&s;al knowledge, and greatly e&s;teemed by all ranks of people.</P>
<P>A number of dramatic authors followed JODELLE with various &s;ucce&s;s; but no &s;ingle effort proved any thing equal to the model from which they copied, till, in GARNIER, JODELLE found a mo&s;t powerful rival. There is &s;omething &s;o very extra|ordinary in the particulars of that man's life that I &s;hall briefly relate them.</P>
<P>ROBERT GARNIER was born at FERTE BER|NARD, in LE MAINE. He was intended for the law, the &s;tudy of which profe&s;&s;ion he very little re|garded, his inclination leading him wholly to elegant and cla&s;&s;ical literature. It was not, however, till after JODELLE had obtained con&s;iderable repu|tation that GARNIER was known as a poet; but as &s;oon as his name came fairly before the public, he
<PB N="234" REF="238">
was con&s;idered as a French SOPHOCLES, born to eclip&s;e their AESCHYLUS, JODELLE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To make this &s;imilitude more perfect, he began his career with gaining a prize at the Fea&s;ts of FLORA, e&s;tabli&s;hed in PRO|VENCE for the encouragement of poetry.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The report of his fame &s;oon reached the court, and CHARLES the Ninth was very anxious to attach him to his &s;ervice; but he preferred the comfort and tranquility he enjoyed in the bo&s;om of his fa|mily, to the anxiety and unea&s;ine&s;s attendant on the followers of kings. HENRY the Second made an|other attempt to entice him to court, alluring him with large offers to forward his fortune. He had, however, the courage to re&s;i&s;t this &s;econd tempta|tion, and pronounced upon this occa&s;ion as he had upon the other, a harangue of thanks which proved him a good orator, a true philo&s;opher, an excellent poet, and a zealous citizen.</P>
<P>He was, neverthele&s;s, prevailed upon by his friends for the good of his country, which &s;tood in need at that time of every hone&s;t man's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to accept a charge in the grand council of the na|tion; and, for this purpo&s;e, he e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf at PARIS. He had not been long in the capital with his wife and his children, whom he tenderly
<PB N="235" REF="239">
loved, when the plague almo&s;t de&s;olated that city by its ravages. This was about 1580; and, in ad|dition to the danger he had to apprehend to him&s;elf and his family, a mo&s;t horrible plot was devi&s;ed again&s;t him by his &s;ervants, who formed the mon|&s;trous and dreadful project, for the purpo&s;e of plun|dering the hou&s;e, of poi&s;oning him, his wife, and his children, under an idea that their &s;everal deaths might be lain upon the plague.</P>
<P>This &s;hocking plot was detected and its perpe|trators convicted and puni&s;hed; but it operated on poor GARNIER and his family, only as a lingering death in&s;tead of an in&s;tant one; for, no &s;ooner had the wife of GARNIER lifted the poi&s;on to her lips, by which means the di&s;covery was made, but &s;he felt its cruel effects; and though every a&s;&s;i&s;tance was given her &s;he fell into a weakne&s;s and a langour that at length terminated her life. GARNIER &s;urvived her but a &s;hort time, leaving his incon&s;olable children to the care of friends indeed, but without a father or a mother.</P>
<P>His tragedies, eight in number, are evidently imitations of the Greek and Latin poets. He has cho&s;en &s;ubjects &s;uitable to the times in which he wrote, and calculated to in&s;pire horror at tho&s;e civil wars with which FRANCE was convul&s;ed during
<PB N="236" REF="240">
his life. This he con&s;idered to be his duty as a poet and a patriot; and while his zeal in the cau&s;e of his country added animation to his genius, he at once wrote le&s;&s;ons for the conduct of his country|men, and examples for the enlargement of their un|der&s;tandings.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"No pieces,"</Q> &s;ays his biographer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"were at that time equal to tho&s;e of GARNIER. His &s;ub|jects are noble, his per&s;onages are great charac|ters, his &s;tyle is harmonious, and &s;ometimes energetic. The critics, however, have reproached him with preferring the manner of SENECA to that of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES, and to have given in dialogue, which &s;hould be as near to nature as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ometimes the familiarity of epi&s;tle, &s;ometimes the epic pomp of the epopoeia, &s;ometimes the pindaric flights of ode, and &s;ome|times the pa&s;toral images of eclogue. In a word, to have forged new expre&s;&s;ions, chequered with Greek and Latin; but, in &s;pight of the&s;e faults,"</Q>
continues this writer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"GARNIER will always hold a con&s;iderable rank as a dramatic poet."</Q></P>

<P>FROM GARNIER to HARDY, comprehending al|mo&s;t the la&s;t half of the &s;ixteenth century, FRANCE produced many authors, &s;ome of whom were men of original invention; but far the greate&s;t part were either tran&s;lators, or imitators of the ancients, or el&s;e of their cotemporaries in other countries. I &s;hall not, therefore, &s;peak particularly of any of the&s;e, for they were remarkable for nothing but their &s;trict conformity to the bad ta&s;te and puerility of many of tho&s;e who had gone before them.</P>
<P>To keep this matter, therefore, as intere&s;ting as po&s;&s;ible, it will be better altogether to pa&s;s by this dramatic cha&s;m, and come at once to HARDY; who, by his a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ecundity, by the new character and particular conduct of his tragedies, &s;ome of which are now to be procured, certainly wrought a remarkable epoch in the hi&s;tory of the French drama.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="242">ALEXANDER HARDY was born at PARIS, but it is very uncertain in what year, who were his parents, or how he pa&s;&s;ed his youth. All we cer|tainly know is, that about the year 1600, he was cele|brated for his dramatic talents, and at that time we find him a retainer to a &s;trolling company, whom he, in an a&s;toni&s;hing manner, perpetually &s;upplied with novelty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BAIF, JODELLE, and GARNIER, were men of family, and con|&s;equently every particular concerning them is very ea&s;y to be traced. HARDY was, very probably, the &s;on of an actor and actre&s;s; and, therefore, his birth, and his death, are marked with ob&s;curity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His reputation, however, &s;oon attracted the at|tention of the comedians of PARIS, who, at their e&s;tabli&s;hment, when they came to a re&s;olution of performing three times a week, found they could not carry their &s;cheme effectually into execution without the a&s;&s;ociation of this poet, who appeared to be &s;o capable of furni&s;hing continual novelty. HARDY undertook the ta&s;k, and performed it with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that he continued their almo&s;t ex|clu&s;ive writer to his death, which happened &s;ome|time between 1628 and 1632; for, at the fir&s;t of tho&s;e dates, he was certainly alive, having at that time publi&s;hed him&s;elf the &s;ixth volume of his works; and, at the latter, he was dead, for his widow was then obliged to commence a law &s;uit again&s;t
<PB N="239" REF="243">
the managers for having &s;hamefully rejected to fulfil their contract with him.</P>
<P>HARDY is &s;aid to have written eight hundred pieces. This is extremely improbable, and indeed it is very much doubted. Many authors of repu|tation, however, for though they &s;eem very little to regard him, are yet anxious about his works, agree that he had an invention incredibly fertile; and, in|deed, if it be true, that he almo&s;t wholly &s;upplied the theatre for nearly thirty years; his productions mu&s;t have been immen&s;e in point of number, what|ever they were in point of merit.</P>
<P>SCUDERY, who in&s;i&s;ts that HARDY wrote eight hundred dramatic pieces, adds that he was a great man in &s;pight of the envy that pur&s;ued him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If SCUDERY had in&s;tanced this as a proof of his being a great man nobody would have doubted him.</NOTE>; that, had he worked for his amu&s;ement in&s;tead of through nece&s;&s;ity, his productions would have been inimita|ble, but as he unfortuaately &s;truggled with poverty, too often to the reproach of the world, an attendant on poetry, in neglecting HARDY, the age in which he lived has &s;ub&s;cribed an indelible record of its own ignorance.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="244">PERFAICT &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are two PERFAICTS. They were brothers, and wrote in conjunction; but all the French writers have a habit of men|tioning them as if their works were written by one author; I &s;hall, therefore, conform to it.</NOTE>, that if SCUDERY for inimi|table had &s;ub&s;tituted the word pa&s;&s;able, this eulo|gium on HARDY would have been literally truth; adding, that one proof, not only of his merit but his influence was, that he e&s;tabli&s;hed a regular price for dramatic pieces, which no author had ever been able to accompli&s;h before him. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For the re&s;t,"</Q> continues PERFAICT,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is very ea&s;y to &s;ee that his &s;ubjects are without choice, or di&s;ernment, that his ver&s;ification is poor and low, and that he has ill ob&s;erved the rules of decency and decorum, &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in dramatic poetry; but, with all his faults, it cannot be de|nied that he was born with di&s;tingui&s;hed talents; which, it is to be lamented, his mi&s;erable &s;ituation and his unfortunate propen&s;ity to write ver&s;e &s;o rapidly, almo&s;t deprived him of the power to make an anvantageous u&s;e of. It may be &s;aid further, that he certainly under&s;tood effect on the &s;tage more naturally, and in a manner more per|fect, than any of the poets who preceded him; and he gave &s;o new a form to the theatre at PARIS, that tho&s;e &s;pectacles, which began with him to be
<PB N="241" REF="245">
performed three times a week, before his death were performed every day."</Q></P>
<P>GUERET, in a work, entitled <HI>The War of the Authors,</HI> &s;ays that HARDY wrote ver&s;e with &s;uch facility, that he would often produce two thou&s;and lines in twenty-four hours, and that, in three days, he would write a comedy, the comedians would get perfect in it, and it would appear before the public<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have no certain account that HARDY wrote any comedy at all, therefore that part of GUERET's remark is as ridiculous as the re&s;t. Two thou&s;and lines is equal to eighty pages, the letter the current &s;ize of this hi&s;tory. What writer will undertake, in a day, to copy <HI>half</HI> that quantity, much le&s;s invent it. Be&s;ides GUERET, in his kindne&s;s, outcalculates him&s;elf; for he not only tries to prove that HARDY was very lazy, for at this rate he might, in&s;tead of eight hundred, have written more than three thou&s;and pieces; but he eclip&s;es the poet in the &s;uperior merit of the actors; unle&s;s, as in the ca&s;e of FALSTAFF and the prince, HARDY had the talent of in|&s;piring the actors with his in&s;tinct.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FONTENELLE, &s;peaking of HARDY, writes more &s;oberly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His fecundity,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"cer|tainly is marvellous; but then neither his ver&s;es nor the di&s;po&s;ition of his pieces have co&s;t him much pains. Nothing comes ami&s;s to him. Every &s;ubject is good. Whether it is the death of ACHILLES, or a trade&s;man's wife that the hu&s;band catches in adultery, it is all the &s;ame to HARDY.
<PB N="242" REF="246">
Every thing is equally tragedy. Nor have man|ners or decorum any thing to do in the bu&s;ine&s;s. Now we &s;ee a pro&s;titute in her bed who &s;upports her character very naturally; now we are enter|tained with a rape; and, now, a married woman meets her lover at the place of a&s;&s;ignation, and they fairly tell the audience that they are going to bed together."</Q></P>
<P>FONTENELLE is al&s;o very angry with HARDY for the immorality of his expre&s;&s;ions, which, he &s;ays, not only hurt his cau&s;e but his reputation. To call a woman a &s;aint, is not only irreligious, but unpoetic. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"If he called her a godde&s;s,"</Q> &s;aid FONTENELLE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it would be perfect poetry, and the very fiction that is permitted to lovers. It is too &s;erious to &s;port with truth. There are &s;aints but there are no godde&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here FONTENELLE has written a &s;atire on doctor JOHNSON, and a panegyric on SHAKESPEAR. JOHNSON will not allow any thing mythological to be admitted into poetry. SHAKESPEAR, who knew without a prompter the whole province of poetry, makes JULIET &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Swear by thy gracious felf who art <HI>the god of my idolatry,</HI></Q>
and I'll believe thee."</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"However,"</Q> continues FONTENELLE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the pieces of HARDY have not that tire&s;ome and un&s;upportable tame|ne&s;s
<PB N="243" REF="247">
of the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e that have gone before them. But this is all the merit we can allow them; for, though the &s;ubjects give them &s;ometimes greater &s;trength and intere&s;t, the poetry is not written with proportionable force."</Q></P>
<P>The reader will very readily, from the&s;e re|marks, form a pretty correct judgment of HARDY. Certainly the French &s;tage has &s;ingular obligations to him; but it is prudent, however, to ob&s;erve that, though he has general merit he has particular faults; which, to do him ju&s;tice, no one was more ready to point out than him&s;elf; endeavouring, at all times, in very laudable &s;elf defence, to throw the odium on his unfortunate &s;ituation, which obliged him to write more than he had an opportunity to correct; and this &s;hould &s;eem, really, to prove that his ge|nius and his talents were &s;uperior to what the world had a right to &s;uppo&s;e them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To give HARDY as much fair play as po&s;&s;ible, let us in&s;tance DRYDEN; who, though he has immortalized him&s;elf by a &s;ingle poem, would have left behind him by no means a brilliant fame had he written only for the &s;tage. Not from his want of &s;uperior ge|nius and talents, but from his having been a dramatic drudge as HARDY was. I cannot, however, compliment HARDY with placing him by the &s;ide of DRYDEN, who&s;e wor&s;t play has probably more poetry than HARDY's be&s;t. I only mean to in&s;tance the &s;imilarity of &s;ituation between the two men, and by that to prove, that if the ex|traordinary reputation of DRYDEN was materially injured by his theatrical trammels, the &s;ame inconvenience mu&s;t certainly, in a pro|portionable degree, have le&s;&s;ened the reputation due to HARDY.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="248">As to the number of pieces written by HARDY, we know by name but of forty-one. SCUDERY, as we have &s;een, in&s;i&s;ts that he wrote eight hundred, and GUERET has a much higher notion of the matter; but SCUDERY is a writer who was remarka|ble for exaggeration, and GUERET, very probably, as his <HI>Battle of the Authors,</HI> like SWIFT's <HI>Battle of the Books,</HI> is a &s;atire, only meant to ridicule what he did not believe.</P>
<P>HARDY him&s;elf, in his preface to his works, &s;peaks of &s;ix hundred and more; which FON|TENELLE plea&s;antly ob&s;erves, was no number at all when it is con&s;idered that his cotemporary, LOPES DE VEGA, had given to SPAIN two thou&s;and. It &s;hould &s;eem, as he him&s;elf printed an edition of his works, that over and above the forty-one pieces that edition contained, his productions were, per|haps, irregular, or unfini&s;hed, or written to &s;erve &s;ome local or temporary purpo&s;e, or of &s;ome other de&s;cription that rendered them unfit for publication, and, therefore, whatever might have been their number, he thought none of them worthy of &s;e|lection.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="249">Certainly HARDY mu&s;t have paved the way for that reputation the French &s;tage &s;o &s;oon afterwards experienced; for we &s;ee, in his life time, not only &s;o great an avidity in the public to frequent the the|atre that from three times a week plays were per|formed every day; but &s;oon after he got almo&s;t an exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the drama, on account of the prodigious concour&s;e of &s;pectators, the comedians, for the accommodation of the public, &s;eperated into two companies, one continuing in their old theatre, <HI>Le Hotel de Burgogne,</HI> and the other removing to a new one <HI>au Marais</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was about 1600, when, by an ordonnance of the police, the doors of the theatre were obliged to be opened at one o'clock in the day, and the performance to begin at two and fini&s;h at four. At that time it was fa&s;hionable to dine at noon. There were no lamps in PARIS, few coaches, it &s;tunk with filth, and &s;warmed with thieves.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Indeed, the more we con&s;ider the circum&s;tance, the more we &s;hall have to admire that HARDY &s;ingle handed could &s;u&s;tain the prodigious ta&s;k of furni&s;h|ing novelty to the theatre with improved &s;ucce&s;s for nearly thirty years, when we &s;hall &s;ee that it re|quired not le&s;s than twenty celebrated men to keep it up to any pitch of excellence for the following fifty years, during which period the &s;tage flouri&s;hed under the great CORNEILLE.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="250">On taking leave, therefore, of JODELLE, GAR|NIER, and HARDY, it may be remarked, that JO|DELLE merited all the prai&s;e he received for emu|lating BAIF, and, thereby, re&s;cuing the French &s;tage from barbari&s;m by introducing the ancients; for though he mu&s;t have found in&s;urmountable dif|ficulties in attempting to &s;uit the harmony of the Greek language, and the maje&s;ty of the Roman, to tiercene&s;s of the French; yet tho&s;e traits of na|ture and &s;implicity to which he was able to give force and effect, were not only admirable in them|&s;elves, but &s;erved as a model for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, which foundation for fame ought not to be denied him; for though it was only &s;owing a harve&s;t for others to reap, yet it mu&s;t be allowed that his la|bours, though not perfect, were highly meritorious, and that had he lived a century later he would cer|tainly have been a celebrated writer.</P>
<P>To GARNIER another &s;pecies of prai&s;e is due, which places his character, as a great genius, even above that of JODELLE; for, though he took his &s;ubjects from the ancients, his applications were all at home, certainly the fir&s;t and mo&s;t perfect pro|vince of tragedy; and which gives a writer oppor|tunity to blend the patriot with the poet. He in|&s;pired FRANCE with a ju&s;t horror of dome&s;tic di&s;|&s;entions, by repre&s;enting the entrails of ROME torne
<PB N="247" REF="251">
by her proper citizens. He combatted pride, envy, and cruelty in the Romans, that they might be de|te&s;ted by the French. A pen like this is the club of HERCULES, and does more towards e&s;tabli&s;hing dome&s;tic tranquility than a thou&s;and armies. The&s;e de&s;troy men, the other de&s;troys mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>The prai&s;e of a bold and &s;ucce&s;sful attempt at this reformation is due to GARNIER; who, had he been able to have accompli&s;hed that extreme diffi|cult ta&s;k of imitating without becoming a manneri&s;t, would, to the force of his writings, have added ta&s;te and &s;tyle; but the French language had not at that time been &s;ufficiently filtered to be limpid. It required that JODELLE and GARNIER &s;hould be perfected by CORNEILLE, and RACINE; who, admirable as they were, experienced advantage in finding the &s;ource already explored to their hands.</P>
<P>As to HARDY, we can add no more than that, had he given him&s;elf time he mu&s;t have greatly eclip&s;ed his predece&s;&s;ors; and, taking in the idea, that there was no competitor&s;hip, nothing to excite emulation in him; but, on the contrary, that his invention was con&s;tantly on the &s;tretch, and that his whole employment was to exhau&s;t his fertile and
<PB N="248" REF="252">
productive mind, and all this for no induce|ment but general applau&s;e, for he was always poor, it is impo&s;&s;ible to deny that his genius was inexhau&s;tible, his indu&s;try meritorious, and his patience exemplary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VII. SCUDERY, TRISTAN, MAIRET, DU RYER, ROTROU, AND OTHER HARBINGERS OF CORNEILLE.</HEAD>
<P>WE are now come to the time when the dramatic art in FRANCE began to look proudly forward to|wards perfection; an era which, in any country, cannot be expected but from a grand a&s;&s;ociation of talents. This event nature &s;eems at that time to have con&s;idered her&s;elf indebted to FRANCE, for the fifty years during which CORNEILLE adorned literature, produced a larger li&s;t of eminent dra|matic writers than any other country in the &s;ame period ever had to boa&s;t.</P>
<P>As this great luminary was &s;urrounded with many &s;atelites at his birth, who &s;hone with &s;ome brilliancy as they followed him through his career, it will not be improper, in a &s;ummary manner, to &s;peak of their merits the better hereafter to il|lu&s;trate his.</P>
<P>GEORGE SCUDERY, who we have already known
<PB N="250" REF="254">
as the panegryi&s;t of HARDY, &s;eems to have been in need of a &s;imilar panegyri&s;t him&s;elf; for, in endea|vouring to out-do his favourite, he fell into much more unpardonable errors him&s;elf. He was not con|tented with writing very fa&s;t, and con&s;equently very imperfect, but he thought proper to chu&s;e &s;ubjects that were unintere&s;ting, and plots that were inex|plicable. His &s;cenes are, therefore, alternately wonderful and tire&s;ome, and his &s;tyle beautiful and bomba&s;tic.</P>
<P>His dramatic pieces, eight in number, were pub|li&s;hed at various times, as well as a variety of other productions, all which are &s;aid to have had a great &s;ale<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This great &s;ale of the works of SCUDERY provoked the fol|lowing impromtu:
<Q><L>Ah happy SCUDERY, in thought &s;o profu&s;e,</L>
<L>That thy pen every month a new book can produce:</L>
<L>'Tis true thy productions ne'er yet had pretence</L>

<L>Yet, SCUDERY, be happy; though wi&s;e men ne'er heed 'em,</L>
<L>Still book&s;ellers &s;ell 'em that idiots may read 'em.</L></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>SCUDERY was born of a noble family, in 1601, at HAVRE DE GRACE, and died at PARIS in 1667. He &s;erved in the army, obtained a high rank, and was admitted of the French academy.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="255">FRANCIS TRISTAN, &s;urnamed the Hermit, and &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;prung from the famous PIERRE LE HERMITE, author of the fir&s;t cru&s;ade, was born in the Chateau de Souliers, in the provence DE LA MANCHE, in 1601. His character &s;eems to have been &s;omething &s;imilar to our SAVAGE the poet, for he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;imilar merit, laboured under &s;imi|lar misfortunes, and endured &s;imilar poverty.</P>
<P>TRISTAN was placed near the per&s;on of the marquis DE VERNEUIL, natural &s;on of HENRY the Fourth; but, having had the misfortune to kill an officer in a rencounter, he fled to ENGLAND, where he fir&s;t imbibed a ta&s;te for letters. After a time he returned, and mar&s;hal DE HUMIERES &s;ee|ing him at BOURDEAUX, pre&s;ented him to LOUIS the Thirteenth, who granted him a pardon, and GASTON D'ORLEANS took him for one of his gen|tlemen in ordinary.</P>
<P>Gaming, wenching, and poetry filled the time of poor TRISTAN, but not his pockets. His po|verty was extreme. BOILEAU tells us that he pa&s;&s;ed his &s;ummers without a &s;hirt, and his winters without a coat. He died in 1655, after having led a life agitated and full of events, which he him&s;elf has given an account of in his romance called <HI>The Di&s;graced Page.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="256">TRISTAN wrote a great variety of things, but he is chiefly &s;poken of for his dramatic productions, of which there are eight known to be his, and two attributed to him. His merit was of a &s;uperior &s;tamp to SCUDERY and others. His tragedy of <HI>Mariamne</HI> has certainly con&s;iderable merit. Indeed this piece, as well as &s;ome others of his writings, furni&s;hed matter for the imitation of more cele|brated men, and there can be no doubt, had not his life been chequered with &s;o much madne&s;s and folly, had he not neglected his friends, trifled with his reputation, and di&s;graced his &s;ituation, for he was noble by birth, and had the di&s;tinction of a &s;eat in the French academy, TRISTAN would have made a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in literature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will be recollected that TRISTAN formed his dramatic ta&s;te in ENGLAND. This was &s;ome time after the death of SHAKESPEAR, who&s;e works, as well as tho&s;e of JONSON, BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, and other writers of that time, he mu&s;t have read. This will incontrovertibly prove that both tragedy and comedy were infinitely forwarder in ENGLAND than in FRANCE, but I &s;hall re|&s;erve my&s;elf for a better opportunity of &s;peaking to this particularly; when, I think, I &s;hall ea&s;ily &s;hew that whatever may have been our obligations to the French theatre &s;ince CORNEILLE and MOLIERE, it never would have arrived to the &s;tate of perfection in which they left it, had not their cold inanimate productions received a prome|thean glow from the &s;ervid and cele&s;tial genius of SHAKESPEAR.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of MAIRET there is very little to &s;ay. He was born two years before CORNEILLE, and died
<PB N="253" REF="257">
two years after him. He &s;eems as if he had kept his reputation by his connections; for being at|tached to the admiral MONTMORENCY, he was created a nobleman for his valour. As to any pre|tentions to rank as a poet he had none but what were very &s;lender indeed. His pieces, which amount to twelve, are in general tragi-comedies, and clothed in very indecent language. They are bold and broad, but have neither conduct, nor regularity. His <HI>Sophoni&s;ba,</HI> however, in which he has ob&s;erved the rule of twenty four hours, excited &s;ome curio&s;ity; nay it is even &s;aid that VOLTAIRE, on that account, attempted to repair it; but he de&s;i&s;ted, &s;aying, that it was like an old hou&s;e; it might be pulled down and rebuilt with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of better materials, but that it was impo&s;&s;ible to repair it.</P>
<P>DU RYER, who was born in PARIS, of a noble family, in 1605, was admitted into the academy in 1656. He was &s;ecretary to the duke DE VEND&Ocirc;ME, and obtained late in life the brevet of hi&s;toriogra|pher of FRANCE with a &s;uitable pen&s;ion. A di&s;|proportionate marriage reduced him to work by the &s;heet as a poet. This is enough to prove that what|ever his merit might have been it had not fair play. He left behind him nineteen dramatic pieces, and five more are attributed to him. <HI>Alcion&eacute;e, Saul, and Scevole,</HI> are &s;aid to have con&s;iderable merit. <HI>L'Abbe</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="258"><HI>D'Aubignac,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Alcion&eacute;e,</HI> is full of beauty and grandeur; MENAGE con&s;iders it as a <HI>chef d'oeuvre,</HI> and CHRISTIAN, queen of SWEDEN, was &s;o en|amoured of it, that &s;he had it con&s;tantly read to her three times a day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is nothing to the &s;tyle of MADAME DACIER's partiality for <HI>The Clouds.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>DU RYER is generally allowed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of reputation; which, if it was his due, &s;hackled and trammelled as it was, mu&s;t have been much greater had he written up to his feelings and not at the command of a ta&s;k ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>ROTROU was born at DREUX, in 1609, three years after CORNEILLE; but, as he died thirty years before that great poet, it will be proper that he &s;hould be &s;poken of here. ROTROU would have been invited to become a member of the French academy had he been a re&s;ident in PARIS, which regulation, except to honorary members, was in|di&s;pen&s;ible. As it was he was obliged to decline this di&s;tinction, con&s;idering it his duty to write at DREUX, where he had &s;everal honourable em|ployments, to the duties of which he fell a &s;acrifice; for, conceiving his pre&s;ence nece&s;&s;ary for the better regulation of the inhabitants during a pe&s;tilential
<PB N="255" REF="259">
fever, he was him&s;elf carried off by the di&s;order he had been &s;o &s;olicitous to avert.</P>
<P>In nineteen years ROTROU produced thirty-&s;ix pieces; in which, as his labours were entirely de|voted to the valuable purpo&s;e of rendering tragedy natural and intere&s;ting, and as there are a great number of poetic beauties to be found in his pro|ductions, there can be no doubt but he may be fairly con&s;idered as the neare&s;t at that time, in point of intrin&s;ic merit, to CORNEILLE.</P>
<P>ROTROU, neverthele&s;s, wrote too fa&s;t. His &s;oible was gaming, and whenever he had a bad chance he repaired it by writing a play. Thus his pieces have not all the &s;ame force and beauty. It cannot, however, be denied that in mo&s;t of them there is an elevation in the de&s;igns; the ideas are novel, grand, and bold; and the conduct announces a judicious ta&s;te, and a well informed mind.</P>
<P>His errors are the errors of the times, from which even CORNEILLE was not free. His &s;ources, like the &s;ources of other poets, were, as occa&s;ion &s;erved, Greek, Roman, Italian, Spani&s;h, and En|gli&s;h. Tragi-comedies were at that time the pre|vailing ta&s;te, and the&s;e were taken from romances, ill con&s;tructed, &s;tuffed with tri&s;ling characters, frivo|lous
<PB N="256" REF="260">
epi&s;odes, and every thing unnece&s;&s;ary and ex|traneous. Combats, meetings, partings, di&s;gui&s;es, and other fanta&s;tic and extravagant circum&s;tances, outraged common &s;en&s;e and propriety, de&s;troyed &s;ober and rational expectation, and gave the piece more an air of knight errantry than nature.</P>
<P>In this extravagance, perhaps, ROTROU too much indulged him&s;elf; but it was only going with the herd, and it does not preclude him from the hone&s;t &s;hare of prai&s;e due to his real merit, which was great and commanding, and which, had he lived to have curbed the mettle of his volatile mu&s;e, might have confirmed him a reputation, perhaps, but little inferior to his great cotemporary.</P>
<P>It will be proper to follow ROTROU with &s;ome account of DASMARETS, COLLETET, and BOISRO|BERT, which &s;our, together with CORNEILLE, a&s;&s;i&s;ted cardinal RICHELIEU in the fabrication of &s;everal mi&s;erable performances, in which it is al|lowed he had a hand, but which were mo&s;t probably originally written by him and retouched by tho&s;e five poets, who fathered the&s;e plays that the repu|tation of the cardinal as a great &s;tate&s;man might not be &s;candalized.</P>
<P>DESMARETS, who was born in 1595, &s;eems to
<PB N="257" REF="261">
have had &s;ome wit, but much more cunning. He was called <HI>Le Bel-e&s;prit</HI> of vi&s;ionaries, and the vi&s;ionary of <HI>Les beaux-e&s;prits.</HI> He managed, however, his vi&s;ions &s;o well that they realized for him &s;everal lucrative &s;ituations under cardinal RICHELIEU, through who&s;e &s;olicitation he was al&s;o one of the fir&s;t members of the French academy. He publi&s;hed ten very indifferent dramatic pieces, in many of which the cardinal is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had a hand, particularly tho&s;e under the titles of <HI>Europe,</HI> and <HI>Mirame.</HI></P>
<P>COLLETET, coun&s;ellor, and one of the forty members of the French academy, was neither &s;o fortunate, nor &s;o prudent as DESMARETS; for, though he was a great favourite of the cardinal, and conde&s;cended to take his &s;hare of the odium which attached to him and his colleagues in con&s;e|quence of the folly of RICHELIEU, who vainly fan|cied it was as ea&s;y to become a poet as a &s;tate&s;man, he had not wherewithal to bury him when he died.</P>
<P>BOISROBERT, who, being one of RICHELIEU's favourites, was given a con&s;iderable place, and al&s;o introduced among the members of the French aca|demy, &s;eems to have had a fertile genius, and le&s;s &s;ervility than DESMARETS and COLLETET. He publi&s;hed twenty dramatic pieces, &s;ome of which re|ceived
<PB N="258" REF="262">
no advantage from the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the cardinal.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o a man of very incon&s;iderable merit, of the name of CHAPELAIN, who &s;eems to have been the &s;ervant of all work in his bu&s;ine&s;s. He was compiler, amanuen&s;is, prompter, in &s;hort any thing; but the mo&s;t convenient among his ac|commodating qualities was his fathering all &s;uch mi&s;erable pa&s;&s;ages of the cardinal as the re&s;t of the fraternity thought would di&s;grace them.</P>
<P>RICHELIEU, no doubt had a hand in many of the writings of DESMARETS and BOISROBERT; but the pieces &s;uppo&s;ed to have been fir&s;t written by him, and afterwards fitted to the &s;tage by the five poets, as they were then called for di&s;tinction, were <HI>Europe, Mirame,</HI> and the <HI>Tuilleries</HI>; &s;ome particu|lars relative to which pieces it may not be unenter|taining to relate.</P>
<P>After the cardinal had written <HI>Europe,</HI> he &s;ent it by BOISROBERT to the French academy, compo&s;ed principally of his creatures, and entreated their opinion without flattery; begging al&s;o they would hone&s;tly correct any thing that militated again&s;t the rules of the theatre, or poetry in general. The academy flattered by the unlimited conditions
<PB N="259" REF="263">
given them, and, perhaps, plea&s;ed at an opportu|nity of vaunting their own con&s;equence, forgot the deference due to the cardinal's patronage, and di&s;|figured the manu&s;cript with &s;o many alterations that it was all one blot, like the picture of PRA|XITELES.</P>
<P>BOISROBERT having with extreme difficulty and caution made his report to his principal, the poor cardinal, who could &s;tand unmoved when any di&s;a&s;ter happened to the &s;tate, fairly &s;unk under this di&s;a&s;ter that had happened to his play; and, in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m of his de&s;pair, he tore the copy to pieces, threw it into the chimney, and in a &s;tate of the greate&s;t de&s;pondency went to bed.</P>
<P>Happily, being &s;ummer, there was no fire on the hearth, and this the wretched cardinal, with the true tenderne&s;s of a father for his dear offspring, re|collected. He got up, &s;ent for CHEREST, his &s;ecre|tary, ordered him to collect all the &s;craps that had been thrown into the chimney, and a&s;ked him to get &s;ome pa&s;te, or if there was none in the hou&s;e, to go to the laundry and fetch &s;ome &s;tarch. CHEREST in|&s;tantly obeyed his ma&s;ter's orders, produced the &s;tarch, and they pa&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the night
<PB N="260" REF="264">
together &s;tarching and patching the play till, at length, it wore a pretty legible form.</P>
<P>Next morning the play was copied in the car|dinal's pre&s;ence, who ordered the corrections made by the academy to be changed, except &s;ome few of the mo&s;t immaterial; and, in this &s;tate, he &s;ent it back by BOISROBERT, with directions to inform the academy that they might &s;ee he had profited by their advice; but, as it was po&s;&s;ible they might not be more infallible than him, he had not altogether abided by their alterations.</P>
<P>This proceeding had the de&s;ired effect; for the academy, perhaps at the in&s;tance of BOISROBERT, DESMARETS, and the re&s;t, having by this time con|&s;idered, that, however, &s;couting the cardinal's play might, as a &s;et of literary characters add to their reputation, yet applauding it would as politicians add more to their intere&s;t, they thought proper to return it without any further correction, together with a letter expre&s;ling their unanimous approbation.</P>
<P>The cardinal, however, had a more impartial and, certainly, a more ju&s;t ordeal to pa&s;s than the academy. The public, awed by no con&s;ideration of intere&s;t, damned the piece; and both the car|dinal
<PB N="261" REF="265">
and the academy were &s;o a&s;hamed of them|&s;elves that, not prevailing upon any of the five to acknowledge a concern in the play, it was attributed by con&s;ent to a man of the name of St. SOURLIN, a creature of the cardinal.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Mirame,</HI> the cardinal gave a &s;en&s;ible proof that he was its author, for it co&s;t him a hun|dred thou&s;and crowns to bring it on the &s;tage. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the fir&s;t repre&s;entation, and was in an agony of de&s;pair at finding it did not &s;ucceed. When he went home he ordered DESMARETS to attend him. Poor DESMARETS fearing to face his patron alone, took with him a friend, who&s;e name was PETIT, and who had &s;ome humour, and more pre&s;ence of mind.</P>
<P>The moment the cardinal &s;aw them, <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"will the French, do you think, ever have any ta&s;te? Do you know they were not de|lighted with <HI>Mirame.</HI>"</Q>
DESMARETS was con|&s;ounded, but PETIT knowing better how to humour the cardinal, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It was not I a&s;&s;ure you mon&s;eigneur,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the fault of the play, which is admirable, It was the fault of the actors. Your eminence mu&s;t have perceived that they were not only imperfect in their parts, but they were all drunk."</Q> 
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I thought &s;o,"</Q> &s;aid the cardinal;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"well, we
<PB N="262" REF="266">
&s;hall &s;ee what is to be done on the next repre|&s;entation."</Q></P>
<P>DESMARETS and PETIT, were &s;o &s;atisfied by this hint, that they packed an audience, who were not only admitted gratis<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, probably, was the origin of orders; a practice by no means improper under certain regulations and re&s;trictions; but which, carried to &s;uch a &s;hameful height as to form a po&s;itive oppo&s;ition to the public opinion, ought to be publicly &s;couted. It was formerly the privilege of actors, according to their re&s;pective &s;ituations, to give their friends a gratuitous opportunity of &s;eeing them perform; who, in return, promoted their intere&s;t at their benefits. It was al&s;o held politic, both for the particular intere&s;t of the theatre, and the general intere&s;t of the public, that men of genius &s;hould be permitted gratis to witne&s;s dramatic productions, becau&s;e the advice of enlightened men mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;i&s;t the operations of the &s;tage. There are &s;ome few more ca&s;es al&s;o, in which orders are not an in&s;ult but a compliment to the public. But when it reaches to the &s;candalous length of procuring a &s;uborned auditory, who, right or wrong, are told to &s;upport a piece, whatever may be the expre&s;s &s;en&s;e of the public, I know of nothing &s;o &s;hameful and &s;o revolting. Every man who hazards a trial of his abilities before an Engli&s;h audience is as &s;afe as on a trial for life before an Engli&s;h jury; nay, it is ju&s;tice multiplied; for, &s;hould he &s;ucceed, in&s;tead of twelve jurors he has hundreds, in|deed now thou&s;ands, who &s;incerely rejoice at his acquittal, and, on the contrary, &s;hould they, from truth, from candour, and from the deference due to their own di&s;cernment, be unwillingly obliged to pronounce a har&s;h &s;entence; &s;till, be it author, or actor, has the ob|ject, who&s;e merits they have met to inve&s;tigate, an obligation to their deci&s;ion, which may either beget emulation, that emulation may produce perfection, or el&s;e induce a relinqui&s;hment of that pur&s;uit for which there was no qualification. But this is not all. Putting it out of the que&s;tion that the public ought to be offended at the in&s;olence of the&s;e gratuitous critics, who cry bravo in concert, and applaud at the word of command; there is not common &s;en&s;e in the mode by which the&s;e manoeuvres are conducted. Tho&s;e who vi&s;it a theatre through the medium of orders, exclu&s;ive of &s;uch as I excepted before, are a &s;et the mo&s;t vulgar, the mo&s;t ignorant, and, indeed, the mo&s;t impudent that can be imagined. Can a manager have an idea that they embelli&s;h his theatre? They &s;it in the boxes it is true, but their appearance would di&s;grace the upper gallery. Can he rely upon them to critici&s;e a dramatic performance? They do not under&s;tand it. Does he think that they are the proper per&s;ons to rely on in ca&s;e of a riot? The very rever&s;e, they exi&s;t but in a row. What an evil then mu&s;t it become when it is con&s;idered, for &s;o is the fact, that, with all this meanne&s;s, this ignorance, and this vulgarity, the&s;e orderly people in every po&s;&s;ible way inconvenience all the re&s;t of the audience. They get the be&s;t places, they are the loude&s;t critics, and they feel them&s;elves &s;o perfectly at home, that they con|&s;ider the play and its repre&s;entation as an entertainment entirely pro|vided for their accommodation. It were pity but managers and authors, for actors are now &s;o abridged of this privilege that they are out of the que&s;tion, had &s;ufficient manline&s;s and independence to break through this di&s;graceful cu&s;tom. It would at once &s;peak a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their own merits, and an hone&s;t determination to court a deci&s;ion from the real voice of the public; the only one that can reflect any lu&s;tre on their reputation.</NOTE>, but paid for going; and we

are told by PELISSON that the cardinal enjoyed this hired applau&s;e with the mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic rap|ture, &s;ometimes &s;hewing him&s;elf to the audience, that they might be induced to applaud, &s;ometimes loudly applauding him&s;elf, and &s;ometimes com|manding &s;ilence, that his favourite pa&s;&s;ages in the play might be the better attended to. Poor BOIS|ROBERT, however, with all his zeal, &s;uffered &s;e|verely
<PB N="264" REF="268">
upon this occa&s;ion; for, not being able in &s;o much hurry and bu&s;tle to di&s;criminate as to the characters of tho&s;e volunteers for whom he, toge|ther with his colleagues, had beat up under the banner of the cardinal, he unfortunately introduced &s;ome ladies of equivocal character into the box where &s;at the duche&s;s of AIGUILLON, who was &s;o outraged and offended at this conduct, that RICHE|LIEU mo&s;t ungratefully bani&s;hed him at her reque&s;t.

<P>The comedy of <HI>The Tuilleries</HI> was performed in the cardinal's palace, who arranged all the &s;cenes him&s;elf. CORNEILLE, who, perhaps, felt him&s;elf a little awkward upon this occa&s;ion, wanted to alter &s;omething in the third act; but RICHELIEU told him <HI>qu'il falloit avoir un e&s;prit de &s;uite,</HI> meaning that the genius for him mu&s;t be one &s;ub&s;ervient and accommodating.</P>
<P>The prologue of this comedy, which was written by the cardinal, but fathered by CHAPELAIN,
<PB N="265" REF="269">
prai&s;ed all the authors, who were &s;eated upon this occa&s;ion very con&s;picuou&s;ly among the audience. COLLETET, after the manu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">pt of the comedy was fini&s;hed, read it to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">al; who, having heard four lines, was &s;o en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">d that he imme|diately laid him down fifty pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">es, bidding him &s;top there, for that the king's revenue could not furni&s;h enough to pay for the re&s;t in proportion. The fol|lowing are the lines which &s;o enchanted the cardinal:
<Q><L>En meme temps j'ai vu, &s;ur le bord d'un rui&s;&s;eau,</L>
<L>La canne s'humecter de la bourbe de l'eau;</L>
<L>D'une voix enrouee, et d'un battement d'aile,</L>
<L>Animer le canard qui languit aupres d'elle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This is exactly BAYES's boar and &s;ow, and if the&s;e five poets had made it their &s;tudy to hold the cardinal up as an object of ridicule they could not have more effectually &s;ucceeded. That every reader may have an opportunity to judge of this great &s;tate&s;|man's ta&s;te, I have endeavoured to render the&s;e four lines into En|gli&s;h in &s;uch a way as to do ju&s;tice to all the parties.<Q><L>So have I &s;een, inclining to be fond,</L>
<L>The humid duck explore the muddy pond;</L>
<L>Ply her thick voice, her wings in dalliance &s;hake,</L>
<L>To animate to love the amorous drake.</L></Q></P>

<P>COLLETET laughed in his &s;leeve at this genero&s;ity of the cardinal, and, being a&s;ked by a friend if it was true, an&s;wered,
<Q><L>" What a &s;um for four lines, full of quibbles and quirks,</L>
<L>" Ah would at this rate I could fell all my works!"</L></Q></P></NOTE>.</L></Q></P>
<P>RICHELIEU, when he became more acquainted with the&s;e lines, thought he could improve them,
<PB N="266" REF="270">
and &s;ent for COLLETET to talk to him upon the &s;ubject. COLLETET wi&s;hed to know what alter ation he thought proper to make, and the cardinal &s;aid the &s;econd line, <HI>La canne s'humecter de la bourbe de l'eau,</HI> ought to run <HI>La canne barboter dans la bourbe de l'eau</HI>; barboter, which means to muddle, being a better phra&s;e than humecter, which means to moi&s;ten. COLLETET affected to think the mat|ter worthy mature con&s;ideration, and promi&s;ed to write to the cardinal upon the &s;ubject. This pro|mi&s;e he performed, &s;ubmitting to his patron whether the word muddle was not too low and unworthy an application for the cha&s;te pa&s;&s;ion of a duck and a drake<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SCRUB's ob&s;ervation of two intriguing ducks in a mill-pond, &s;eems to have originated from the cardinal's favourite pa&s;&s;age. How uncon&s;cious FARQUHAR was that he made SCRUB ridicule the great RICHELIEU.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The cardinal, who was extremely angry with this letter, had &s;carcely read it, when he was waited on by &s;everal courtiers, who came to announce to him a brilliant victory, the mea&s;ures of which had been taken by his advice and the whole conducted under his direction. They addre&s;&s;ed him in a &s;tyle full of flattery, &s;aying nothing could re&s;i&s;t the au|thority of his eminence. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are mi&s;taken,"</Q> &s;aid the cardinal,

<P>It can be ea&s;ily under&s;tood how &s;uch men as DESMARETS, COLLETET, and BOISROBERT, came to be RICHELIEU's poetic drudges; but it is ex|traordinary that CORNEILLE, or even ROTROU, &s;hould notoriou&s;ly join &s;uch a confederacy. It appears, however, that they con&s;ented to it with extreme reluctance, for they were by no means active in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and withdrew them&s;elves as &s;oon as they could. Nay, it &s;hould &s;eem that RICHELIEU felt this poignantly, for he did every thing in his power to injure CORNEILLE; and, indeed, meditated a revenge which he thought would accompli&s;h his ruin.</P>
<P>It, however, di&s;graced the cardinal mo&s;t &s;ignally, which the reader will ea&s;ily allow when it is known that this meditated revenge was no le&s;s than ven|turing a &s;econd repre&s;entation of <HI>Europe,</HI> which had been damned, in oppo&s;ition to CORNEILLE's popular tragedy of <HI>The Cid. Europe</HI> was thus performed under the influence of the cardinal; but when the actor came to give it out again he
<PB N="268" REF="272">
was hi&s;&s;ed off, and nothing further was &s;uffered till the performers promi&s;ed the <HI>Cid</HI> for the next night's repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>RICHELIEU is excu&s;ed by his biographer for all this ab&s;urdity under an idea that he patronized the&s;e poets, but the rever&s;e happens to be the fact; for, according to what we have read, they patro|nized him. In&s;tead of allowing to them the in|fluence of his name, and protecting every valuable line they wrote, he made them his tools that he might vaunt under their &s;anction every mi&s;erable line written by him. Is this patronage? No. Give me that &s;pontaneous di&s;intere&s;ted patronage that, without any &s;elfi&s;h views or pretentions, di&s;tin|gui&s;hes merit, fo&s;ters it, brings it to light, &s;anctions it, recommends it; and, thereby, confers an ho|nourable plea&s;ure on the patron, and proves a mu|tual advantage to the poet and the public.</P>
<P>But, putting every other con&s;ideration out of the que&s;tion, there cannot be any thing &s;o &s;illy as the idea of &s;everal men writing in conjunction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among many in&s;tances that may be cited to prove this, POPE, GAY, and ARBUTHNOT, who &s;eparately, one would think, might have written a tolerable good play, laid their heads together and pro|duced a mo&s;t wretched farce that was de&s;ervedly damned.</NOTE>.
<PB N="269" REF="273">
Here the application is particularly in point; for though every one of the&s;e men, except the cardinal, produced, &s;ingle handed, plays which had &s;ucce&s;s; yet, when they worked together, nothing could be more contemptible than the i&s;&s;ue of their labours.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP VIII. DRAMATIC EVENTS FROM THE BIRTH OF COR|NEILLE TO THE DEATH OF CARDINAL RICHELIEU.</HEAD>
<P>THE great CORNEILLE, an appelation that ad|mirable writer very honourably merited, was born at ROUEN, the twenty-&s;ixth day of June, 1606. He brought out his comedy of <HI>Melite</HI> in 1625, at the age of nineteen, and he died the fir&s;t of October, in 1684.</P>
<P>He was intended for the bar, but his genius was too elevated for that profe&s;&s;ion; at the &s;ame time it was difficult to divine what bent his mind would take, as he manife&s;ted no extraordinary gifts of na|ture. The &s;park, however, only lay dormant. It remained to be rou&s;ed into action by love. A young man took his friend with him to vi&s;it his mi&s;tre&s;s; the lady cho&s;e the friend and rejected the lover; the friend, charmed with this pre&s;erence, be|came a poet upon the &s;pot. Hence the comedy of <HI>Melite,</HI> and hence the emancipation of the great CORNEILLE.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="275">There was treachery in the ca&s;e certainly; but the lady, who was the &s;ubject of the comedy, and who went a long time in ROUEN by the name of MELITE, was principally to blame; yet, whatever anger the lover of this lady might harbour again&s;t his mi&s;tre&s;s, the public were willing to acknowledge the highe&s;t obligations to her, for they &s;eemed from that moment to have a ta&s;te for dramatic entertain|ments unknown to them before.</P>
<P>The particulars of this great man's life, which for &s;uch a man are rather confined, will gradually come in with the accounts of his dramatic &s;ucce&s;s; which, for a time, I &s;hall now uninteruptedly follow. His &s;econd piece was a tragi-comedy called <HI>Cli|tandre,</HI> which he wrote to correct the too great &s;implicity that, with all its merit, the public com|plained of in <HI>Melite.</HI> This effort, however, had better have been let alone; for, if <HI>Melite</HI> was too &s;imple, <HI>Clitandre</HI> was too extravagant; and RO|TROU having two years before brought out his fir&s;t comedy, <HI>The Bague de L'oubli,</HI> with &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;oon after his comedy of <HI>The Hypocondriaque,</HI> the public had pau&s;ed upon the merit of CORNEILLE, which doubt <HI>Clitandre</HI> unfortunately did not &s;erve to clear up.</P>
<P>His third piece called <HI>La Veuve,</HI> which was a
<PB N="272" REF="276">
comedy, did not make its appearance till 1634, and in the interval between <HI>Clitandre</HI> and that, RO|TROU had brought out <HI>Dori&s;t&eacute;e et Cl&eacute;ag&eacute;nor, l'Hereu&s;e Con&s;tance, Les Occa&s;ions Perdues, Les M&eacute;nechmes,</HI> which &s;erved afterwards as a &s;ubject for REG|NARD, and <HI>Celemene,</HI> which was again retouched by TRISTAN, and at length written anew and brought out by ROTROU, with prodigious &s;ucce&s;s, under the title of <HI>Vence&s;tas</HI> in 1647<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When <HI>Vence&s;tas</HI> was in rehear&s;al, ROTROU was put into pri&s;on for a gaming debt; he, therefore, &s;old his piece to the players for twenty pi&s;toles, which was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to relea&s;e him, but its &s;uc|ce&s;s was &s;o extraordinary that they gratuitou&s;ly pre&s;ented him with a con&s;iderable &s;um, all which proves that, as this was in the zenith of CORNEILLE's reputation, ROTROU mu&s;t have been highly in favour with the public. This piece which like the Cid was originally Spani&s;h, was afterwards popular from a remarkable circum&s;tance. The famous BARON quitted the theatre for thirty years, and he fini&s;hed his &s;econd career as he had done his fir&s;t by performing in this play. He was then &s;eventy years old, and had &s;uch an a&s;thma that he could &s;carcely &s;peak. He was, however, entreated to per|form, but had &s;carcely uttered twenty lines when he was obliged to quit the &s;tage, which he did with the&s;e remarkable words:
<Q>Si proche du cereueil ou je me vois de&s;cendre.</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus ROTROU had by this time made a for|midable &s;tand again&s;t CORNEILLE, which circum|&s;tance neither <HI>La Veuve</HI> nor, <HI>La Galerie du Palais,</HI> a comedy performed the &s;ame year, had power ma|terially to affect; nor even another comedy called <HI>La Suivante,</HI> the principal merit of which is, if we
<PB N="273" REF="277">
believe a French author, that the five acts are &s;o exactly of a length that there is not a &s;ingle line in any one more than any other.</P>
<P>It is very po&s;&s;ible that this extraordinary effort of bringing out three pieces in one year, evidently excited by the &s;ucce&s;s of his rival, and, after all, meeting with but indifferent &s;ucce&s;s him&s;elf, in|duced CORNEILLE to join the cardinal's confederacy, for it was on the following year that <HI>The Tuilleries</HI> was performed, in which our author notoriou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted as one of the five. We mu&s;t, however, do him the ju&s;tice to believe that he very &s;oon grew &s;ick of the connection, for <HI>Europe</HI> did not appear till 1637<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I found it extremely difficult to get any authority that I might rely on in relation to the fir&s;t appearance of this play. The accounts generally &s;ay that it came out in 1643, but this cannot be, for the cardinal died in 1642. It is mo&s;t probable that it was produced as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after the <HI>Cid,</HI> and, therefore, I have placed it in 1637, which &s;ome accounts &s;eem to confirm.</NOTE>, and, for <HI>Mirame,</HI> it was not performed till 1639; and as we know that the cardinal and CORNEILLE were at enmity when the <HI>Cid</HI> was pro|duced, which was in 1636, it is almo&s;t reduced to a certainty that this coalition, as far as our poet was concerned in it, did not la&s;t much more than a year, and that he would never have joined it at all but under the expectation of meeting with a liberal pa|tron,
<PB N="274" REF="278">
in which expectation he was completely di&s;|appointed.</P>
<P>In 1635 appeared, written by CORNEILLE, a comedy called <HI>La Place Royale,</HI> and his fir&s;t tra|gedy called <HI>Med&eacute;e,</HI> neither of which had by any means capital &s;ucce&s;s; and early in 1636, came out a comedy called <HI>L'Illu&s;ion,</HI> which CORNEILLE him|&s;elf confe&s;&s;es he wrote by way of diverting his mind from the gloom of having written <HI>Med&eacute;e,</HI> and, there|fore, he declares it de&s;erves but little notice. In the interim ROTROU, always at work, had &s;urprized the public with <HI>L'Heureu&s;e Naufrage,</HI> and four or five other pieces, &s;o that their &s;ucce&s;s was hitherto upon the whole pretty nearly equal, but it was very &s;oon decreed that the genius of CORNEILLE &s;hould gain &s;o complete a triumph as to leave all his com|petitors at an immen&s;e di&s;tance, for in two months after the appearance of <HI>L'Illu&s;ion</HI> came out that admirable performance. <HI>The Cid.</HI></P>
<P>This piece, which has many &s;triking beauties, and many glaring faults, is neverthele&s;s, upon the whole, a mo&s;t extraordinary effort. <HI>The Cid</HI> was celebrated before CORNEILLE brought it out. He him&s;elf acknowledges that he is much indebted upon this occa&s;ion to GUILLIN DE CASTRO, a Spani&s;h poet, and FONTENELIE &s;ays that there was
<PB N="275" REF="279">
no nation, however barbarous, where the <HI>Cid</HI> was unknown. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, the <HI>Cid</HI> it&s;elf mu&s;t have been as barbarous as tho&s;e people who cheri&s;hed it, till it came poli&s;hed from the hands of CORNEILLE, who alone was intended as the lapidary to &s;hew the lu&s;tre of this diamond.</P>
<P>Never had a tragedy more celebrated &s;ucce&s;s. It was repeated by heart, taught to children, and it was the cu&s;tom to &s;ay <HI>beau comme le Cid.</HI> Cardinal RICHELIEU, we are told, had an ambition to be known as the author of it; but CORNEILLE, fonder of fame than fortune, rejected the propo&s;al with contempt. That all powerful mini&s;ter in other things, defeated in this, in&s;i&s;ted that the academy &s;hould examine it, who pre&s;ently, in their officious zeal to oblige their principal, found out that all the rules of the drama were violated. CORNEILLE's partizan agreed to this, but drew from the&s;e pre|mi&s;es a mo&s;t powerful conclu&s;ion in its favour.</P>
<P>All the poets, however, influenced by either the bribes or menaces of the cardinal, joined in this hue and cry again&s;t the <HI>Cid,</HI> with the &s;ingle exception of ROTROU, who with a generous di&s;dain refu&s;ed to join the league. ROTROU called CORNEILLE his father, his in&s;tructor, and never cea&s;ed to manife&s;t
<PB N="276" REF="280">
the highe&s;t veneration for his character, which gives no little lu&s;tre to his own when we con&s;ider how long he had been his powerful rival, and how nobly generous it was to place him&s;elf the palm upon the head of his competitor.</P>
<P>It is hardly po&s;&s;ible, and if it were po&s;&s;ible it is almo&s;t ridiculous, to enumerate the ne&s;t of envious hornets which were rou&s;ed by the extraordinary merit and &s;ucce&s;s of this piece. The academy, through the influence of the cardinal, &s;at as gravely and as &s;olemnly to examine its merits as if the wel|fare of the nation had depended upon the i&s;&s;ue of their deliberation; but, as if they feared the ill con&s;equence of this officiou&s;ne&s;s, they affected to proceed with all po&s;&s;ible caution and delicacy.</P>
<P>It is thought that the cardinal's aver&s;ion to this piece proceeded from &s;ome &s;entiments it contained which expo&s;ed the undue influence of mini&s;ters, and reprobated their inju&s;tice and rapacity; it was impo&s;&s;ible, therefore, for him to act too warily. He fir&s;t procured SCUDERY to abu&s;e the work, and then repre&s;ented, through BOISROBERT, to COR|NEILLE that it would be a high advantage to permit his piece to pa&s;s through an examination by the aca|demy, by way of &s;ilencing every clamour; to which CORNEILLE, &s;eeing the drift of the application, an|&s;wered,
<PB N="277" REF="281">
that if the judgment of the academy would give the cardinal the &s;malle&s;t amu&s;ement he cer|tainly &s;hould not oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>This was con&s;trued into a full con&s;ent on the part of CORNEILLE. Commi&s;&s;ioners were imme|diately appointed to examine the <HI>Cid,</HI> and, that every thing might wear an appearance of impartiality, SCUDERY's remarks were al&s;o to be examined. After this the ob&s;ervations of the commi&s;&s;ioners were re|ported and deliberated on in full a&s;&s;embly. It was a long time, however, though they had &s;everal de|bates before they came to a conclu&s;ion, but at length they agreed on reducing the <HI>Cid</HI> to that form in which they thought it ought to have been repre|&s;ented. It was in this &s;tate given to a printer, and the fir&s;t &s;heet was &s;ent to the cardinal for his opinion, who found they had gone from one extreme to the other; for, in&s;tead of pointing out the faults and amending them, they had taken out the beauties and rendered the faults &s;till more glaring than ever.</P>
<P>RICHELIEU, finding he &s;hould only expo&s;e him&s;elf, &s;ent to &s;top the impre&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e what but blind malice could prompt a &s;tep at which the indignant public mu&s;t naturally revolt. Being, therefore, a better politician than tho&s;e he em|ployed, he contented him&s;elf with a few incon&s;i|derable
<PB N="278" REF="282">
alterations, which CORNEILLE had too much good &s;en&s;e to oppo&s;e, and thus the matter was compounded, and the piece has remained in that &s;tate to this hour.</P>
<P>This play, however, though one of the mo&s;t celebrated that has even to this moment appeared upon the French &s;tage, underwent a thou&s;and com|ments. The academy &s;et the example, and it be|came the mode to cen&s;ure the <HI>Cid.</HI> SHAKESPEAR him&s;elf, and that is a bold word, never was more roughly handled. Some lines were &s;aid to be im|moral, others puerile, others bomba&s;tic, and others ridiculous. Even RACINE when he came for|ward as a poet, did not fail to turn the <HI>Cid</HI> into ridicule. He parodied in his piece called <HI>Les Plai|deurs,</HI> the following line &s;poken in the <HI>Cid</HI> by DON DIEGO.
<Q><SP>
<L>Ses rides, &s;ur &s;on front, ont grave &s;es exploits:</L>
</SP></Q>
RACINE's line runs thus:
<Q><SP>
<L>Ses rides, &s;ur &s;on front, gravoient tous &s;es exploits.</L>
</SP></Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How is this,"</Q> &s;aid CORNEILLE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is it permitted to a young man to ridicule people's be&s;t ver&s;es?"</Q>
But in this RACINE only took up the idea of the academy, who&s;e remark was, that wrinkles do not mark exploits, they only mark years.</P>
<P>Poor BARON, as I have already noticed, like
<PB N="279" REF="283">
AESOP, quitted the &s;tage and appeared on it thirty years afterwards. He was then very infirm, but had been &s;o great a favourite that the public &s;uffered any thing from him. One evening, however, when he repeated the following lines, they bur&s;t into an involuntary laugh.
<Q><L>Je &s;uis jeune, il e&s;t vrai: mais aux ames bien nees,</L>
<L>La valeur n'attend pas le nombre des annees.</L></Q>
BARON di&s;regarded the ri&s;ible effect this had upon the audience, and gravely repeated the pa&s;&s;age, when they laughed louder than before; upon which he came forward and &s;eriou&s;ly addre&s;&s;ed the paterre. <Q REND="inline">"Gentlemen,"</Q> &s;aid he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I &s;hall now begin for the third time; but if I hear any one laugh, I &s;hall quit the theatre immediately, never to return."</Q>
This had its effect, and they took particular care to offend him no more, although the &s;ame evening when kneeling at the feet of his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he bid him ri&s;e, he was obliged to entreat the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two &s;cene &s;hifters before he could get on his legs.</P>
<P>But the famous expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"A tu du coeur,"</Q> has been more cavilled at than any thing in the piece. It has, which is &s;aying a great deal, been twi&s;ted and turned as many ways as SHAKESPEAR's <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"put out the light<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A wag had an idea, at the time this line begat &s;o much con|tention, of in&s;i&s;ting that SHAKESPEAR's meaning was as follows:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"When I have put out the light, perhaps, as it has been my cu&s;tom at that time to indulge tho&s;e fond ideas that till the warm imagi|nations of hu&s;bands, who are going to bed to their wives, I may forget my re&s;entment in her embraces, and thus her life may be "&s;pared."</Q>
An idea full of ingenuity as well as poetical ju&s;tice; for, had DESDEMONA lived only an hour, every thing would have been di&s;covered, the guilty would have been puni&s;hed, and virtue would have been triumphant.</NOTE>."</Q> This expre&s;&s;ion has been
<PB N="280" REF="284">
contended was altered by the academy from
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a tu un coeur;"</Q>
and to confirm this, &s;ome of the edi|tions have it &s;o; and I my&s;elf heard it u&s;ed to LE KAIN. The arguments in &s;avour of this la&s;t reading are &s;hrewd and &s;en&s;ible. A tu du coeur is &s;imply, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ha&s;t thou courage?"</Q> Which is a tame que&s;tion indeed to be put to the valorous RODRIGUE, from his father too. A tu un coeur is,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ha&s;t thou a heart?"</Q>
Which may be con&s;trued, Ha&s;t, thou na|ture, affection, family pride, ha&s;t thou, in &s;hort, re&s;olution, dear as the daughter is to thee, to avenge the wrongs of thy father by de&s;troying her's? Is thy affection to thy father proof again&s;t thy love for her to this degree? And his an&s;wer begining <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tout autre que mon pere,"</Q> is heightened by giving it this turn.</P>
<P>But vainly were the tongues and pens of &s;o many writers and critics at work to decry the merit
<PB N="281" REF="285">
of this piece. It triumphed over all its enemies. This DESPREAUX notices in the following lines:
<Q><L>En vain contre le <HI>Cid</HI> un mini&s;tre &s;e ligue;</L>
<L>Tout PARIS pour CHIMENE, a les yeux DE RODRIGUE.</L>
<L>L'Academie en corps a beau le cen&s;urer:</L>
<L>Le public revolte s'ob&s;tine a l'admirer.</L></Q></P>
<P>The only hope that now remained with the cardinal of cru&s;hing CORNEILLE was that his following pro|ductions might be &s;o inferior to the <HI>Cid</HI> as to lower his reputation; but he was completely baffled in the&s;e very charitable expectations; for <HI>Horace,</HI> which was his next performance, confirmed that fame the <HI>Cid</HI> had acquired; and, in &s;pight of the in|trigues of the academy, who again &s;at in judgment on him, the public laughed their puny attempts to &s;corn; and, in proportion as their favourite was calumniated, they &s;trove to render him the ju&s;tice his merit de&s;erved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CORNEILLE &s;aid upon this occa&s;ion that it was but fair his piece &s;hould meet the &s;ame fate of him who was the &s;ubject of it; for, added he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"HORATIUS was condemned by the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">s, but ab&s;olved by the people."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Horace</HI> appeared early in 1639, and a few months afterwards CORNEILLE brought out <HI>Cinna,</HI> a tra|gedy of con&s;iderable celebrity; &s;ome &s;ay it is his be&s;t work, others have declared for <HI>Polieucte,</HI> and he him&s;elf preferred <HI>Rodogune.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="286"><HI>Cinna</HI> wrought an effect on LOUIS the Four|teenth, very honourable for its author, and to the dramatic art. The Chevalier de ROHAN had con|&s;pired again&s;t the &s;tate, and the king had con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to grant his pardon to the mo&s;t powerful and pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations. The night before the exe|cution of the chevalier, LOUIS was at the repre&s;en|tation of <HI>Cinna;</HI> many pa&s;&s;ages of which piece &s;truck him &s;o forcibly, particularly the &s;peech of AUGUSTUS in the fifth act, where he congratulates him&s;elf on having obtained a conque&s;t over his pa&s;&s;ions, that though, from pride, or &s;ome political con&s;iderations, he did not revoke the &s;entence of ROHAN, yet he frequently afterwards declared that if, at that moment, he had been &s;olicited to &s;ave his life under any colourable pretext, he certainly &s;hould have con&s;ented.</P>
<P>This tragedy drew tears from the eyes of the great CONDE at the age of twenty, of which LOUIS augured &s;o well that he con&s;idered it as a pre&s;age of his future greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Polieucte,</HI> which was the next production of CORNEILLE, came out in 1640. This piece had very nearly been con&s;igned to oblivion, or rather &s;mothered in its birth. CORNEILLE &s;ent it to the theatre for the approbation of the actors, who re|fu&s;ed
<PB N="283" REF="287">
to perform it. One of the performers, who was entru&s;ted to return it to the author, one day re|peru&s;ed a part of it as he walked about in his lodg|ings, but being di&s;plea&s;ed with a pa&s;&s;age he met in it, he threw it carele&s;sly from him, and the copy fell upon the te&s;ter of the bed. He gave him&s;elf no further trouble about it, and nobody knew for a con&s;iderable while, what was become of the play. After it had been mi&s;laid eighteen months an up|hol&s;terer took down the bed, and re&s;cued <HI>Polieucte</HI> from oblivion.</P>
<P>Previous to the repre&s;entation of <HI>Polieucte</HI> on the &s;tage, CORNEILLE read that piece at the Hotel de Rambouillet, which was then the &s;overeign tri|bunal in all literary matters. The piece was ap|plauded in the pre&s;ence of CORNEILLE, out of that re&s;pect which they thought due to the merit of &s;o great a man, but VOITURE was privately en|joined to inform CORNEILLE, which he did in the mo&s;t delicate manner, that <HI>Polieucte</HI> had not found that warm encouragement that might have been ex|pected, and that in particular tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which concerned religion had mo&s;t di&s;plea&s;ed. COR|NEILLE, alarmed at this, would have withdrawn his piece, but was at length per&s;uaded to leave it in the hands of the actors, which, however, he would
<PB N="284" REF="288">
not do till one of them promi&s;ed that it &s;hould not be performed. This promi&s;e was broke, which, probably, gave no di&s;plea&s;ure to the author, and <HI>Polieucte</HI> made its public appearance.</P>
<P>In the fourth act of <HI>Polieucte,</HI> there is a &s;cene where SEVERUS, &s;truck with the unity of GOD, di&s;|covers to FABIAN his doubts concerning the Pagan religion, which admits of many deities at once. BELLEROSE, who performed SEVERUS, in convey|ing the&s;e &s;entiments, adopted a tone of &s;uch mo|deration and good &s;en&s;e, that the public, who had before &s;een nothing but extravagance and bomba&s;t, were greatly &s;truck with this new manner, &s;o much more like nature; and, as the &s;ubject was very awful on which BELLEROSE exerted him&s;elf, it was not only prodigiou&s;ly admired, but begat a re&s;pect and con&s;ideration for actors which had not before been attached to their characters.</P>
<P>What SEVERUS &s;ays is no more than the vague doubt of a Pagan, to whom the extravagance of his religion rendered it an object of &s;u&s;picion, but who had not the &s;malle&s;t knowledge of tho&s;e proofs which render the chri&s;tian religion more re&s;pectable than pagani&s;m. On this account CORNEILLE was very much blamed for printing it, for it was &s;aid
<PB N="285" REF="289">
that notwith&s;tanding his delicate and proper inten|tions, they might be mi&s;interpreted.</P>
<P><HI>Polieucte,</HI> however, as I have already &s;aid, be|gan to open the eyes of the public as to the re&s;pec|tability of dramatic entertainments, con&s;idered in a moral light.&mdash;This circum&s;tance, joined to another altogether as extraordinary, no le&s;s than that the actors, from the moment they were con&s;idered as more re&s;pectable, actually became &s;o procured, on the &s;ixteenth of April, 1641, the following favour|able arret.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In ca&s;e the &s;aid comedians regulate the action of their performances, &s;o as to be entirely ex|empt from impurity, we will that their exhibitions&mdash;as by this means they will innocently amu&s;e the public&mdash;be con&s;idered as void of blame and reproach, and al&s;o that their occupation &s;hall not be pleaded as an impediment to the exerci&s;e of any bu&s;ine&s;s, or connection in public commerce."</Q></P>
<P>In 1641, CORNEILLE produced <HI>Pomp&eacute;e,</HI> and in 1642, in which year cardinal RICHELIEU died, ap|peared <HI>Le Monteur,</HI> certainly CORNEILLE's be&s;t comedy, &s;o that the cardinal lived long enough to &s;ee the man again&s;t whom he had &s;hewn &s;o much rancour, merely becau&s;e he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;u|perior
<PB N="286" REF="290">
talents to him&s;elf, which talents he di&s;dained to pro&s;titute for patronage, &s;ecure in a firm and per|manent reputation, which all his infidious arts had not been able to deprive him of.</P>
<P>As to other dramatic events from the birth of CORNEILLE to the death of RICHELIEU, they con&s;i&s;t principally of contentions for fame between different poets, among whom there were a great variety of pretenders, indeed &s;o many that the re|gular theatres could not entertain their productions; in con&s;equence of this, &s;everal attempts were made to e&s;tabli&s;h a third theatre, one of which in 1632 partially &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>A party of the&s;e di&s;appointed poets, through various intere&s;ts, prevailed on the lieutenant civil to grant them permi&s;&s;ion to open a theatre at the Ten|nis-court in the &s;treet <HI>Michel-de-comte</HI> for two years. This theatre being &s;ituated in a part of PARIS where the &s;treets were very narrow, and the &s;ur|rounding inhabitants of the lowe&s;t order it became a ne&s;t for all manner of thieves and &s;harpers, and al&s;o a market for the vent of the mo&s;t execrable literary tra&s;h. It was, therefore, repre&s;ented to the parliament as a nu&s;ance, and in le&s;s than a twelve-month from its e&s;tabli&s;hment it was &s;hut up by au|thority.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="291">Of the confederacy who wrote in the pay of RICHELIEU, we have partly &s;een the &s;ucce&s;s; it may not, however, be improper to go over &s;uch particulars as may &s;erve to &s;hew the complexion of the times as to the encouragement of the drama during that period.</P>
<P>SCUDERY between the birth of CORNEILLE and 1642, brought out fifteen pieces with various &s;ucce&s;s. His fir&s;t performance was a tragi-comedy called <HI>Ligdamon et Lidias,</HI> for which he thus apo|logizes: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have pa&s;&s;ed,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"more years among armies than hours in my clo&s;et, and have u&s;ed more matches to fire guns than to light lamps. I can range &s;oldiers better than words, and know more adroitly to halt a battalion than to round a a period."</Q>
Of the&s;e truths this piece gives abundant proof, for it is certainly a mo&s;t mi&s;erable performance, and &s;hould not have been mentioned here but for the opportunity of noticing what dwarfi&s;h &s;econds RICHELIEU had recour&s;e to when he combatted the giant CORNEILLE.</P>
<P>When SCUDERY produced his <HI>L'Amour Tyran|nique,</HI> a very indifferent performance, the cardinal fought knee deep for it. He declared that this piece &s;poke its own eulogium; and SARRAZIN, to curry &s;avour, printed a di&s;cour&s;e at the head of it
<PB N="288" REF="292">
addre&s;&s;ed to the French academy, where he endea|voured to point out the beauties of the play, and the talents of the author. In con&s;equence of this all PARIS crouded to it, and at their return home laughed at them&s;elves for their credulous folly. Upon the whole his <HI>Mort de C&eacute;&s;ar</HI> &s;eems to have been his be&s;t play, and VOLTAIRE was &s;o much of that opinion that he certainly borrowed many pa&s;|&s;ages from it.</P>
<P>The pieces of DU RYER, during this period, eight in number, are of a better kind than tho&s;e of SCUDERY; but they give proof in how very barbarous a &s;tate the &s;tage &s;till continued. We have &s;een FONTENELLE incen&s;ed again&s;t HARDY for the proflgacy of his mu&s;e and the indecent &s;ituations into which he has thrown his characters, but the <HI>Lucrece</HI> of DU RYER will &s;hew that even the commanding genius of CORNEILLE had not been able to give the theatre that poli&s;h without which it cannot be con&s;idered in a &s;tate of per|fection.</P>
<P>The plot of this piece is &s;imply the Roman &s;tory. TARQUIN, with a poignard in his hand, demands of LUCRETIA the &s;acrifice of her virtue. She &s;truggles and e&s;capes behind the &s;cenes, the audience pre&s;ently hear her cries, and &s;oon after
<PB N="289" REF="293">
&s;he comes on in the utmo&s;t di&s;order and fairly tells the &s;pectators that her honour is violated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This circum&s;tance is topped by the elegant TERENCE in his comedy of <HI>The Andria,</HI> who makes a lady complain on the &s;tage of a pain in her bowels, and after &s;he has retired for &s;ome time, during which &s;he is heard to groan and cry piteou&s;ly, the audience are in|formed that &s;he is brought to bed. Indeed TERENCE is &s;o fond of ladies with child that he has introduced another of them in his <HI>Adelphi,</HI> and al&s;o a common pro&s;titute, both of whom are hone&s;tly married to the&s;e brothers with the con&s;ent of their father and of their uncle who had adopted one of them; and really if the&s;e are the pieces of MENANDER, &s;tolen from the Greek by TERENCE, for the edification of the Romans, and we are to con&s;ider the&s;e productions as models for us, the true drift and intention of the dramatic art is to reward vice and puni&s;h virtue; but the&s;e are the ancients, and who &s;hall have the temerity for a &s;ingle moment to doubt their infallibility.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To MAIRET certainly very little prai&s;e can be due, if we are to credit, which is generally admitted, that <HI>Sophoni&s;ba,</HI> which as we have &s;een VOLTAIRE thought it worth his while to retouch, was written by THEOPHILUS VIAUT, and the <HI>Vio&s;inaries</HI> by DESMARETS, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of RICHELIEU; but this la&s;t may be a mi&s;take, owing to the &s;imi|larity of the names.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething in the &s;tory of VIAUT, that it may be worth while to relate. His manners were
<PB N="290" REF="294">
&s;o licentious that he was bani&s;hed FRANCE. He had, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome friends; and after he had re&s;ided a few years in ENGLAND, where he im|bibed an inclination for the dramatic art, he was re|called. He was always of the per&s;ua&s;ion of the country where he happened to live. In GERMANY he was a Calvini&s;t, in England a Prote&s;tant, and in FRANCE a Roman Catholic. He was, neverthe|le&s;s, in every place a libertine; and as he wrote poetry with great facility, he never failed to la&s;h the roguery of prie&s;ts with great a&s;perity. On his re|turn to FRANCE he wrote a &s;evere poem called <HI>Parna&s;&s;e Satyrique,</HI> which work was con&s;idered &s;o very licentious that he was condemned to be burnt. He e&s;caped and was burnt in effigy. As he was wandering, however, from one retreat to another, he was arre&s;ted at CATELET, and &s;hut up in the &s;ame dungeon with RAVAILLAC. The parliament commenced anew their proce&s;s again&s;t him, and he had &s;uch addre&s;s that his trial was alternately put off and renewed until the expiration of two years; when, through the great intere&s;t made for him, his &s;entence was meliorated to perpetual bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>He retired to the e&s;tate of the duke of MO|MORENCY, where he lived in a more rea&s;onable manner, and declared to his la&s;t hour that he was
<PB N="291" REF="295">
innocent of the charge that had been brought again&s;t him.</P>
<P>He was intimate with MAIRET, who was al&s;o protected by MOMORENCY; and if DESBARREAUX is to be credited, who was the friend and intimate of them both, THEOPHILE left behind him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of MAIRET his tragedy of <HI>Sophoni&s;ba;</HI> which, with the deduction of the <HI>Vi&s;ionaires,</HI> &s;inks MAIRET's fame materially.</P>
<P>Of the productions of ROTROU I have &s;poken more at large, that poet's reputation having been the neare&s;t to that of CORNEILLE. In 1642, he had brought out twenty-&s;ix of his plays, many of which had con&s;iderable merit, and nothing can give &s;tronger proof of this fact than that, though he is at pre&s;ent very little known on the &s;tage by his own proper writings, yet the materials that compo&s;ed them are &s;o good, the characters &s;o natural, and the &s;ubjects &s;o dramatic, that the mo&s;t celebrated writers &s;ince his time have not di&s;dained to take him for their model; witne&s;s <HI>The Th&eacute;baide</HI> of RACINE, which is an imitation of his <HI>Antigone, The In&egrave;s</HI> of DE LA MOTTE, taken from his <HI>Laure Per&s;ecut&eacute;e,</HI> and <HI>Les Soeurs Rivales</HI> of QUINAULT, which is but little more than a copy of his <HI>Deux Pucelles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="296">It would be prolix and tire&s;ome to notice any thing further concerning the theatre during the time it was patronized, if I may &s;o call it, by RICHE|LIEU. A man, as SHAKESPEAR &s;ays, &s;peaking of his brother cardinal, of an unbounded &s;tomach; who, not content with governing FRANCE almo&s;t ab&s;olutely, with lowering the pride of AUSTRIA, and regulating the movements of Europe at his own will, added, to all this de&s;ire of &s;tirring up na|tional commotions, a perpetual wi&s;h of fomenting commotions in the theatre. When the <HI>Cid</HI> came out, he was as much alarmed as if the Spaniards had been at the gates of PARIS. What then mu&s;t have been his mi&s;erable condition, if FONTENELLE is to be believed, who &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that after the <HI>Cid,</HI> CORNEILLE became more elevated in <HI>Horace,</HI> &s;till more in <HI>Cinna,</HI> and &s;till more in <HI>Polieucte;</HI> beyond which no merit can reach."</Q></P>
<P>It cannot be denied that this &s;truggle of RICHE|LIEU to attain dramatic fame certainly a&s;certained what dramatic fame was. The cardinal's favour being naturally &s;ought after, all tho&s;e who fancied they had literary talents put what little merit they had to the te&s;t, all tho&s;e who really had genius, &s;trained every nerve to excel one another. This emulation in a &s;hort time did wonders. It purified
<PB N="293" REF="297">
the ta&s;te, mended the &s;tyle, and regulated the con|duct of dramatic entertainments.</P>
<P>The choru&s;es, which had been introduced by JODELLE, and &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;erved by the dra|matic poets till 1629, were afterwards bani&s;hed from the theatre. In&s;trumental performers were &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in their place, who were fir&s;t &s;ituated between the wings on the &s;tage, afterwards in the upper boxes, after that in the lower boxes, till, at length, it was thought proper to &s;ituate them between the audience and the &s;tage, where they are now con|&s;tantly &s;eated.</P>
<P>For the&s;e and other circum&s;tances, which con|tributed to perfect the theatre, and which could not in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace as twelve years have wrought &s;uch a reform without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome high and commanding influence, the French nation are certainly indebted to RICHELIEU; who, though he in him&s;elf found a wide difference in the talents ne|ce&s;&s;ary to form a great writer and a great &s;tate&s;man, was certainly the cau&s;e of bringing forward to pub|lic notice that merit in others which he envied but could not imitate.</P>
<P>All this FONTENELLE, though his be&s;t apologi&s;t, allows; but he adds, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he recompen&s;ed as a
<PB N="294" REF="298">
mini&s;ter that merit of which he was jealous as a poet; and that, however, his great mind might have had weakne&s;&s;es, he &s;eldom failed to repair his faults by &s;omething noble."</Q>
Surely when FONTENELLE made this remark he forgot that he was writing the life of CORNEILLE.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. FROM THE DEATH OF RICHELIEU TO THE DEATH OF ROTROU.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the great reputation of CORNEILLE, at the death of RICHELIEU, could not have received much additional celebrity, for nothing is &s;o fair an object of public encouragement as that which is pri|vately oppre&s;&s;ed, yet after that period, by being more unre&s;trained, it grew more commanding. His pieces, in the opinion of the public, threw all others at a di&s;tance, and tho&s;e four tragedies which FONTE|NELLE declared nothing could exceed, continually occupied the theatre, adding at each performance a new trophy to his well earned fame.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Menteur</HI> induced CORNEILLE to follow it up with a &s;equel, which like the original was an imitation of <HI>Lopes de Vega.</HI> This &s;equel &s;eems to have &s;hewn its author that, however he might be capable of writing comedy, it was either not his forte &s;o properly as tragedy, or that comedy was not in FRANCE arrived at that perfection to which
<PB N="296" REF="300">
he and others had brought tragedy. Indeed this ta&s;k remained to be performed by MOLIERE.</P>
<P><HI>The Suite du Menteur,</HI> though it received ap|plau&s;e, not, however the applau&s;e to which COR|NEILLE had been accu&s;tomed, and though, when it was better under&s;tood upon a revival, it had &s;till greater &s;ucce&s;s, determined CORNEILLE to return to tragedy. He pau&s;ed, however, probably that he might do nothing unworthy the fame he had &s;o ho|nourably acquired, and did not venture to produce another play until 1646, when the public te&s;tified the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction at his tragedy of <HI>Rodogune.</HI></P>
<P>I have noticed already that CORNEILLE rather inclined to think this his be&s;t work. Let us &s;ee what he &s;ays him&s;elf on the &s;ubject.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I have been often a&s;ked,"</Q>
&s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"which of all my dramatic poems I e&s;teem the mo&s;t, and I have generally found that tho&s;e who have put the que&s;tion to me were prejudiced either in favour of <HI>Cinna,</HI> or <HI>The Cid.</HI> I have, therefore, been cautious of declaring my real &s;entiments, which are certainly in favour of <HI>Rodogune.</HI> This pre|ference is, perhaps, in me the effect of that blind partiality which parents &s;ometimes entertain for one child rather than another; perhaps it may be tainted with a little &s;elf love becau&s;e this
<PB N="297" REF="301">
tragedy is more properly my own than any thing that has preceded it, on account of the incidents being new, original, invented, and &s;uch as had never before been placed on a theatre; and, if this rea&s;on &s;hould be ju&s;t, it e&s;tabli&s;hes a fact which confirms the propriety of my partiality."</Q>
I &s;hall have good opportunity to prove that COR|NEILLE was not &s;ingular in this opinion.</P>
<P>This preference for <HI>Rodogune</HI> &s;eemed a pre&s;enti|ment to CORNEILLE that his reputation was at its height; for, from the time that tragedy was pro|duced till 1653, when CORNEILLE left the theatre in di&s;gu&s;t the particulars of which we &s;hall &s;ee here|after, though his general fame kept an honourable &s;tand, his productions were reviewed with le&s;s warmth than he had been accu&s;tomed to experience. His tragedy of <HI>Theodore,</HI> produced the latter end of 1646, had very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s, con&s;idering it was the production of the great CORNEILLE. <HI>Her|aclius,</HI> brought out in 1647, though admired by the judicious, the world affected not to under&s;tand, and <HI>Andromede</HI> was obliged for the a&s;toni&s;hing reception it met with to &s;cenery, machinery, and a living Pega&s;us, the be&s;t performer, according to public opinion, in the whole piece.</P>
<P>The fact is that CORNEILLE was born to be the
<PB N="298" REF="302">
&s;port of cardinals. RICHELIEU endeavoured to overwhelm him by turning the tide of prejudice one way, and MAZARINE endeavoured to leave him aground, and the theatre with him, by diverting it another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CORNEILLE when he brought out <HI>Cinna,</HI> probably under an idea that it would gall RICHELIEU, had determined to dedicate it to MAZARIN<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">; but receiving an intimation that it would be coldly re|ceived, and above all that he would get no dedication &s;ee, he changed his mind, and addre&s;&s;ed his tragedy to Mon&s;ieur MONTAURON, a <HI>&s;oi di&s;ant</HI> MECAENAS, from whom he received a thou&s;and pi&s;toles. This was every way con&s;idered as a merited &s;atire on the two cardinals, and it was fa&s;hionable afterwards to call epi&s;tles dedicatory, <HI>Epitres a la Montauron.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have noticed that <HI>Theodore</HI> was cooly received. <HI>Heraclius</HI> was of it&s;elf a &s;ingular production; but by the inattention of the public, who began to be tired of every thing regular and &s;triking, it was con|&s;idered as a very heteroclite performance, and in|capable of affording plea&s;ure equal to the pains it took to pay it proper attention.</P>
<P>The fact is, CORNEILLE had been &s;o charmed with that originality on which he &s;o warmly congratu|lates him&s;elf in <HI>Rodogune,</HI> that he was determined to be &s;till more original in <HI>Heraclius.</HI> In con&s;equence of this he has certainly in places ob&s;cured what he meant to elucidate. The Abb&eacute; PELEGRIN whim|&s;ically
<PB N="299" REF="303">
calls <HI>Heraclius</HI> the de&s;pair of all the tragic authors, and DESPREAUX archly &s;ays it is not a tra|gedy but a <HI>logogryphe</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The be&s;t part of the &s;tory is that, with all its originality, COR|NEILLE is accu&s;ed of having &s;tolen <HI>Heraclius</HI> from CALDERONE, who beyond all que&s;tion &s;tole it from him. CALDERONE produced afterwards in SPAIN, a play almo&s;t a tran&s;lation of <HI>Heraclius,</HI> which he called, <HI>In this life every thing is truth and every thing is fal&s;ehood.</HI> The fact is, CALDERONE was in PARIS when <HI>Heraclius</HI> fir&s;t made its appearance. He was introduced to CORNEILLE, who informed him, with the &s;ame frankne&s;s which accompanied all his conduct, that he had formerly been accu&s;tomed, as in the in&s;tance of <HI>The Cid, The Menteur,</HI> and other pieces, to avail him&s;elf of what had been already done by the Spani&s;h poets; but that in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance he had the good fortune to pre&s;ent the public with a happy original. This CALDERONE was very much plea&s;ed to take advantage of; and, though perhaps he would have been the fir&s;t to have acknowledged his obligations to CORNEILLE, the enemies of that great man propa|gated a report that he had &s;tolen his play from CALDERONE, a calumny he &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed that he did not think it worth his while to refute it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee what CORNEILLE him&s;elf &s;ays upon this &s;ubject. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This tragedy,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is more an effort of invention than <HI>Rodogune,</HI> and I may dare &s;ay that it is a happy original, of which there will be many copies."</Q>
He then goes on, ex|plaining the nature of the incidents, in what manner they are knit together, how involved in difficulty and intricacy, and, at length, &s;ays that they certainly cannot be comprehended but by reflection after the fini&s;h of the piece, and, perhaps, they are not to be enjoyed with ta&s;te till the &s;pectators have witne&s;&s;ed a &s;econd repre&s;entation. Certainly this, however it may recommend the piece to a peru&s;al in the clo&s;et,
<PB N="300" REF="304">
cannot be in its favour as a dramatic production, where every thing &s;hould be comprehended at once. But this piece has given his enemies a handle, as well as &s;ome &s;cenes in <HI>Pomp&eacute;e,</HI> to cavil at COR|NEILLE, under the idea of comparing his writings to the turgidne&s;s, the flatulency, and the ob&s;curity of SENECA, rather than the nature, the &s;implicity, and the beauty of SOPHOCLES and EURIPIDES, which opinion FONTENELLE does not altogether contradict.</P>
<P>It was not, however, &s;o much the fault of <HI>Hera|clius</HI> as the times, that the public attention, which had been &s;o unremittingly paid to CORNEILLE, began to waver. MAZARINE, who found that his predece&s;&s;or had been indebted, if not for his po|pularity at lea&s;t for his notoriety, to poets and ac|tors, was determined to &s;ee what fame he could derive from compo&s;ers and &s;ingers. In &s;hort it was in 1647 that MAZARINE e&s;tabli&s;hed the opera in FRANCE, the particulars of which, how|ever, I &s;hall defer till I have gone on with the French theatre to the death of ROTROU.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="305">It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, to introduce the opera here, becau&s;e it immediately became the rage to &s;uch a degree that no dramatic &s;pectacle from that time &s;tood the &s;malle&s;t chance of &s;ucce&s;s that was not recommended to the public by &s;plendid &s;cenery, machinery, and decorations; by which tide of folly we &s;ee CORNEILLE borne away as well as the re&s;t; for in 1650, came out <HI>Andromede</HI> u&s;hered to the public by all the foppery of the Venetian opera.</P>
<P>It would be pityful and unworthy to de&s;cribe all the particulars of that puppet &s;hew through which the public were now to admire the brilliant talents of the great CORNEILLE. One principal object of admiration was a living pega&s;us, &s;lung in a way &s;o peculiar, that he &s;prung into the air and &s;eemed lo&s;t in the clouds. The poor hor&s;e it &s;eems was kept without food till he was almo&s;t &s;tarved, and in that condition fa&s;tened in the flies to a cord with pullies &s;o con&s;tructed that by a counterpoi&s;e his own weight could carry him to the other &s;ide of the &s;tage. When it was the proper time for this pega&s;us to exhibit, a man on the other &s;ide, &s;o concealed as not to be &s;een by the audience, held in &s;ight of the fami&s;hed animal a &s;ieve of oats. The creature in|&s;tantly began neighing and pawing; and when he had been &s;ufficiently irritated, the rope that had re|&s;trained
<PB N="302" REF="306">
him was loo&s;ened and the effort threw him into the air till he arrived at his &s;table in the clouds where he was recompen&s;ed by a good &s;upper for his dexterity.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"'Tis true."</Q> &s;ays the author of this article,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we have &s;een living hor&s;es in the Italian opera, but none of them had to boa&s;t the warlike ardour of the pega&s;us in CORNEILLE's tragedy of <HI>An|dromede,</HI> his movements were admirable, and cer|tainly contributed very materially to the &s;ucce&s;s of the piece."</Q>
Having &s;ettled CORNEILLE &s;o comfortably upon his pega&s;us, or rather upon the hobby hor&s;e of cardinal MAZARINE, I &s;hall now go over &s;uch circum&s;tances as pa&s;&s;ed from 1642 to 1650, and particularly numerate the various &s;ucce&s;s of ROTROU.</P>
<P>TRISTAN during this interval produced four plays, which had tolerable &s;ucce&s;s, but not equal to his <HI>Mariamne,</HI> which I have already mentioned as a celebrated piece. SCUDERY brought forward only one, which was his la&s;t. It was a tragi-comedy called <HI>Axiane,</HI> and written in pro&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SCUDERY, who&s;e emoluments and preferment came through the channel of RICHELIEU's bounty, did of cour&s;e in that &s;tate&s;man's life time what he was bid, and, therefore, could not indulge his own vein as to writting; in which in&s;tance the cardinal for once was cer|tainly in the right; for finding that SCUDERY had nothing for it but an inflated &s;tyle borrowed from the &s;chool of SENECA, he advi&s;ed him never to write a play in pro&s;e. As &s;oon, however, as the cardinal died, and he had the liberty of writing without a dictator, he in|dulged the bent of his own inclinations and wrote <HI>Axiane</HI> in pro&s;e; when his mu&s;e, being unaccu&s;tomed to walk without &s;tiles, hobbled &s;o wretchedly that the piece was not only con&s;igned to oblivion but the author too; for this failure, added to the di&s;like the public con|ceived again&s;t him for meddling with the reputation of CORNEILLE, induced him at the per&s;ua&s;ion of his friends to lay down the employ|ment of a dramatic writer.</NOTE>. This piece was pro|duced
<PB N="303" REF="307">
in 1643, and though SCUDERY lived till 1667, we hear no more of him as a dramatic writer.</P>
<P>SCARRON, who was born in 1610, and died in 1660, brought out his fir&s;t piece called <HI>Jodelet; or the Ma&icirc;tre Valet,</HI> in 1645; and four others before 1650. The la&s;t of the&s;e, <HI>L'Heritier Ridicule,</HI> plea&s;ed LOUIS the Fourteenth, when he was young, to &s;uch a degree that he had it performed three times in one day. It will be nece&s;&s;ary hereafter to &s;peak of this extraordinary man and his productions.</P>
<P>L'ETOILE, a very laboured writer, brought out one piece in 1643, and another in 1647. He is &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted RICHELIEU, and &s;ome authors will have it that he was one of the five who &s;at as the o&s;ten&s;ible authors of <HI>Les Tuilleries,</HI> by which it &s;hould appear that CORNEILLE did not &s;u&s;tain that di&s;grace; but I am afraid that we mu&s;t not flatter
<PB N="304" REF="308">
our&s;elves with any &s;uch hopes, for VOLTAIRE, and many other authors have taken &s;o much pains to a&s;|certain the fact, that it is my unwilling duty, as a hi&s;torian, to &s;et it down for truth.</P>
<P>LA SERRE, a curious author, and a whim&s;ical character, brought out in 1643, a tragedy called <HI>Sainte Catherine,</HI> and another the following year called <HI>Th&eacute;&s;&eacute;e.</HI> He wrote five other wretched plays, &s;ome of which, however, through the influence of RICHELIEU, had great &s;ucce&s;s; in particular <HI>Thomas Morus,</HI> fir&s;t performed about &s;ix months before the cardinal died. It was repre&s;ented at the Palais Royal, and &s;eems to have been one of the cardinal's la&s;t efforts to injure the reputation of CORNEILLE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A public print of that time, evidently under the influence of the cardinal, gives the following account of <HI>Thomas Morus.</HI>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This play acquired a reputation which no other of its time ever had. Cardinal RICHELIEU was melted into tears whenever he was at its repre&s;entation; he gave public te&s;timony of his high e&s;teem for it, and per&s;uaded all the court to follow his example. <HI>Le Palais Royal,</HI> was too &s;mall for the concour&s;e of people that crouded to it, and four porters were killed in one evening endea|vouring to keep away the multitude.
This is,"</Q> &s;ays the para|graph writer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what I call a good piece. Mon&s;ieur CORNEILLE has never had &s;uch powerful proofs of the excellence of his pro|ductions, and I never will permit him to rank before LA SERRE till any one of his pieces &s;hall have excited &s;o much public curio&s;ity as to be the death of five porters."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="309">LA SERRE was librarian to Moun&s;ier, brother of LOUIS the Thirteenth, and had a &s;uperficial knack, in con&s;equence of his acquaintance with catalogues and the names of authors, of writing a great deal without method or coherence.

Having attended one day to a very long and tire|&s;ome public di&s;cour&s;e, he embraced the orator as he de&s;cended from the ro&s;trum. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"My dear friend,"</Q> &s;aid he, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I did not think &s;uch a thing was po&s;&s;ible."</Q> <Q REND="inline">"What?"</Q> &s;aid the other. <Q REND="inline">"What!"</Q> replied LA SERRE,

When he was reproached with the

<P>LA CALPRENEDE, who enjoyed, in &s;ome degree, the favour of RICHELIEU, and who was, as report goes, much indebted to the great CONDE for &s;ome epi&s;odic parts of his pieces, was a native of GAS|CONY, and a dramatic poet. He produced in all thirteen pieces, four or five of which appeared be|tween 1642 and 1650. To his patrons, however, he is indected for his reputation, if it may be &s;aid
<PB N="307" REF="311">
that he had any. He read his comedy of <HI>Clariente</HI> one day to RICHELIEU, who told him that the piece was tolerably good upon the whole, but that the expre&s;&s;ions were <HI>lache;</HI> a word &s;ignifying, as to writings, loo&s;e, carele&s;s, negligent, and, as to men, cowardly. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Cade&s;is,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid the author, in the true ga&s;conade &s;tyle,

<P>GOMBAULT, of whom there is nothing re|markable but that he was one of the members of <HI>Beaux-e&s;prits,</HI> formed under CONRADE, which gave ri&s;e to the French academy, brought out two pieces during the intermediate period at which we are arrived.

His fir&s;t piece a comedy, called <HI>Les Engagements du Hazard,</HI> came out in 1647, it was taken from two pieces of CALDERONE; one hav|ing the &s;ame title, and the other <HI>The hou&s;e that has two doors it is difficult to guard.</HI> His next comedy produced in 1649 called <HI>Les Feint A&s;trologue,</HI> is al&s;o taken from a play of CALDERONE under the &s;ame title, <HI>El A&s;trologo Fingido;</HI> which, two years before, had however been brought forward at the theatre by D'OUVILLE, brother of BOIS|ROBERT, whom I &s;hall pre&s;ently have occa&s;ion to mention.</P>
<P>The&s;e pieces, and <HI>Don Bertrand de Cigarral,</HI>
<PB N="309" REF="313">
which came out early in 1650, are all I &s;hall &s;peak of at pre&s;ent from T. CORNEILLE, which as the fir&s;t and &s;econd were taken from CALDERONE, and the other from DON FRANCISCO DE ROXAS, and after all was a mere farce, though in the minority of LOUIS the Fourteenth, it was certainly performed at court more than twenty times, amount yet to no|thing that promi&s;es for him a reputation likely to keep pace with his brother.</P>
<P>D'OUVILLE was an author of incon&s;iderable merit, and it well might be &s;o if he was as he is re|pre&s;ented to have been much inferior to his brother. The pieces he brought out from 1642 to 1650, were <HI>Jodelet A&s;trologue,</HI> almo&s;t copied as abovementioned by T. CORNEILLE, <HI>The Coeffeu&s;e a la Mode,</HI> and <HI>Les Soup&ccedil;ons &s;ur les Apparence,</HI> in all which he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by BOISROBERT.</P>
<P>BOISROBERT in 1646 brought out <HI>L'Inconmic,</HI> which was taken from CALDERONE, and almo&s;t in the &s;ame manner with T. CORNEILLE's fir&s;t piece <HI>Les Engagemens du Hazard.</HI> This did T. COR|NEILLE but little &s;ervice, but he excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying that he had long written it but had rea&s;ons for keeping it back. BOISROBERT brought out be|fore 1650 al&s;o <HI>La Jalou&s;e D'elle M&eacute;me,</HI> tran&s;lated from <HI>Lopes de Vega.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="314">BENSERADE, a writer of merit, about this time produced two or three plays. He was born of a no|ble family in NORMANDY, in 1612, and intended for the church, of which body he was expected to have made a very re&s;pectable member, but his de&s;tiny decided otherwi&s;e; for having &s;een Madamoi&s;elle BELLEROSE, a beautiful woman, and a favourite ac|tre&s;s, he &s;oon exchanged his breviary for a ca&s;t book, and his &s;aints for the mu&s;es. It is a&s;toni&s;hing with what avidity he cultivated his theatrical employments. Nothing came ami&s;s, as we &s;hall &s;ee when we find him compo&s;ing Ballets in conjunction with QUIN|AULT and LULLY. By the liberality of the queen, cardinal MAZARINE, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of rank, he acquired a large fortune, which he enjoyed uninteruptedly till his death, which happened, at the age of eighty, in an extraordinary manner.</P>
<P>He had &s;uffered &s;ome time the greate&s;t agonies from the &s;tone; which, notwith&s;tanding his advanced age, he was determined to get rid of by cutting. His courage, however, was put to a proof &s;till more extraordinary, for a &s;urgeon, who by way of pre|paration had been in&s;tructed to bleed him, wounded an artery and was &s;o alarmed for fear of the con&s;e|quences that he fled without binding up the arm. BENSERADE, therefore, bled to &s;uch a degree that a&s;&s;i&s;tance came too late, and they had ju&s;t time to
<PB N="311" REF="315">
call in a confe&s;&s;or when he expired with great firm|ne&s;s in the arms of his friends.</P>
<P>When we have &s;een the &s;ucce&s;s of ROTROU's re|maining pieces, we &s;hall have before us every thing of any material con&s;equence that was oppo&s;ed to CORNEILLE from the death of RICHELIEU till 1650. PARIS at that time &s;warmed with authors, and &s;o indeed it has from that time to this; but my limits will not permit me to give more than the lead|ing features of dramatic productions and events.</P>
<P>ROTROU brought out ten pieces during the in|terval we are &s;peaking of, and all with a con&s;iderable degree of reputation particularly <HI>Co&s;roes,</HI> which has been often revived with &s;ucce&s;s, <HI>Don Lopes de Cardonne</HI> which was proclaimed worthy the pen of CORNEILLE, and <HI>Vence&s;tas</HI>; which, in addi|tion to what has been &s;aid of it already, was re|vived by MARMONTEL, and begat a literary di&s;|pute, that I &s;hall notice in its place, highly honour|able to the reputation of ROTROU.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, taking in all the circum&s;tances, we mu&s;t certainly place ROTROU as a dramatic writer of eminence. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the requi&s;ites of a poet of this de&s;cription. He knew character, con|duct, and di&s;crimination; he had the good &s;en&s;e to
<PB N="312" REF="316">
reject, as much as the times would permit him, that barbarity which characteri&s;ed the French &s;tage; and, though his own talents were not of weight and con&s;equence enough to attempt the Herculean ta&s;k of clean&s;ing this augean &s;table, yet when he found CORNEILLE had re&s;olutely undertaken this labour, he certainly lent him a re&s;pectable helping hand. So that we may fairly &s;ay, if CORNEILLE had never lived, ROTROU would have enjoyed the fir&s;t rank in his time as a dramatic poet; but CORNEILLE having lived, ROTROU moved only in a &s;econdary &s;phere, although his reputation derived more &s;plen|dour from the reflection of this luminary than it ever could have boa&s;ted from its own proper power. At the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be acknowledged that the reputation of CORNEILLE derived no mean ad|dition from the literary race, in which he was very often hard run, that with &s;trenuous exertion he gained from ROTROU.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. THE OPERA, AND CORNEILLE'S FIRST RETIREMENT FROM THE STAGE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the opera very materially deranged the &s;tate of the theatre about this period, it is nece&s;&s;ary it &s;hould be mentioned here, but I &s;hall defer the account I mean to give of its origin till I have brought the French &s;tage forwarder, le&s;t it &s;hould prove too much a digre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o cool the intere&s;t that na|turally ri&s;es from a progre&s;&s;ive account of tragedies and comedies.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, content my&s;elf with intro|ducing this &s;pecies of entertainment, which ren|dered the French &s;tage a model for &s;cenery to the neighbouring nations, which has been the &s;ource from whence our opera has been &s;upplied with dan|cers; and which fir&s;t conquered &s;en&s;e in favour of &s;ound, and afterwards &s;ound in favour of agility, by quoting the words of VOLTAIRE.</P>

and opera owe their exi&s;tence in FRANCE. COR|NEILLE &s;erved an apprentice&s;hip under RICHE|LIEU with other authors, who worked as amanu|en&s;i&s;es at tho&s;e dramatic plans which were in|vented by the cardinal, and in which he intro|duced &s;ome very bad lines.<P>"Cardinal MAZARINE was the fir&s;t who intro|duced operas, which was a bungling bu&s;ine&s;s, however, a circum&s;tance the more extraordinary as that mini&s;ter did not write any part of them.</P><P>"In 1647 arrived from ITALY a troop of Ita|lian &s;ingers, decorators, and an orche&s;tra. They performed in the Louvre the tragi-comedy of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> in Italian ver&s;e, &s;et to mu&s;ic. The per|formance &s;et all PARIS a&s;leep.

<P>"In the beginning, however, of the &s;ixteenth century, they had ballets in FRANCE, and in the&s;e ballets &s;ome vocal mu&s;ic, relieved by cho|ru&s;es, which, indeed, were little more than the plain gregorian chant. Nay, there are accounts

of Syrens who &s;ung at the wedding of the DUC DE JOYEUSE, &s;o early as the year 1582, but I am afraid they were &s;trange Syrens.</P>
<P>"Cardinal MAZARINE was &s;o little di&s;couraged at the bad &s;ucce&s;s of his Italian opera, that as &s;oon as he came into full power, he &s;ent again for a troop from his own country, who performed <HI>Le Nozze de Peleo et de Thetide,</HI> in three acts, and, to make all &s;ure, LOUIS XIV. danced at this wed|ding. The French were charmed to &s;ee their king young, graceful, and of a figure both no|ble and amiable, after he had been hunted from the capital, dancing in it as if nothing had hap|pened.</P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding the cardinal and his Italians plea&s;ed as little on repetition as at fir&s;t, MA|ZARINE &s;till per&s;i&s;ted. He &s;ent for &s;ignor CA|VALLI, who brought out in the gallery of the Louvre the opera of <HI>Xerxes,</HI> in five acts, but unfortunately the French went fa&s;ter a&s;leep than ever, and all their con&s;olation was that they &s;hould be relieved from the opera by the death of the cardinal, who, indeed, drew on him&s;elf a thou&s;and ridiculous &s;arca&s;ms, and gave place to
<PB N="316" REF="320">
almo&s;t as much &s;atire after his death as had been levelled at him during his life.</P>
<P>"The French had &s;ome ta&s;te for opera, but they were determined it &s;hould be their own language, and performed by their own country|men. The la&s;t, however, was pretty difficult, for there was but one pa&s;&s;able violin in PARIS. However, in 1659, a certain Abbe PERRIN, who took it into his head he could write poetry, and one CAMBERT, leader of the queen's twelve fidlers, which were called the Mu&s;ic of FRANCE, produced a tire&s;ome pa&s;toral, which however &s;tole the palm from <HI>L'Hercole</HI> and <HI>Le Nozze de Peleo.</HI> In 1669, the &s;ame PERRIN and the &s;ame CAM|BERT a&s;&s;ociated them&s;elves with the Marquis DE SOURDEAC, a great mechani&s;t, not ab&s;olutely mad, but very little &s;hort of it, for he ruined him&s;elf in this enterprize.</P>
<P>"Their fir&s;t opera was <HI>Pomona,</HI> in which they in|troduced a great deal about apples and artichokes. After this they repre&s;ented the <HI>Pains and Plea|&s;ures of Love;.</HI> and at length LULLY, who now became &s;uperintendant of the king's mu&s;ic, re|paired the Tennis-court which had ruined the Marquis DE SOURDEAC. The Abbe PERRIN,
<PB N="317" REF="321">
who did not chu&s;e to be ruined, con&s;oled him&s;elf with writing elegies and &s;onnets, and tran&s;lating the Eneid of Virgil in what he called heroic ver&s;e. As for CAMBERT, he quitted FRANCE in dud|geon, and went to perform his dete&s;table mu&s;ic among the Engli&s;h, who thought it excellent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As PURCELL, in 1685, &s;ays that it was then time the Engli&s;h &s;hould begin to loath the levity of their neighbours, this ob&s;ervation of VOLTAIRE might perhaps partially apply. That it did not ge|nenerally, however, &s;uch names as BLOW, GIBBON, and others, will bear me witne&s;s.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"LULLY, in conjunction with QUINAULT, brought out the <HI>Fetes de L'Amour et de Bacchus,</HI> but neither the words nor the mu&s;ic was worthy the reputation the piece acquired. Connoi&s;&s;eurs greatly admired however a tran&s;lation of that charming Ode of Horace, <HI>Donec gratus eram tibi, &amp;c.</HI> This ode is, to &s;ay the truth, finely rendered into French, but the mu&s;ic is extremely dull. There were bu&s;&s;ooneries in plenty in the&s;e operas, and indeed they were full of harlequin|ades; and QUINAULT, to his &s;hame, did not di&s;|dain, as a man of his genius ought, to lend a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to the&s;e puerilities; though in tho&s;e very operas&mdash;part of which were a reproach to him, were many choice and beautiful pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="322">"As for LULLY, he knew pretty well how to accommodate his mu&s;ic to the French language, and as he was a plea&s;ant companion, very de|bauched, and an excellent flatterer, and in con|&s;equence admired by the great, he found no dif|ficulty in carrying away all the applau&s;e from QUINAULT, who was a very contrary character, being naturally mode&s;t, diffident, and una&s;&s;uming. He made the world believe that QUINAULT was his amanuen&s;is, for that all the ideas were his, and that QUINAULT clothed them in better French than he could; in fact, that but for him this admirable poet would only have been known by the &s;atires of BOILEAU: and thus QUI|NAULT, with all his merit, became a prey to an ill-natured &s;atiri&s;t, and an impudent mu&s;ician.</P>
<P>"Thus the beauties, whether &s;imple, delicate, or noble, which were &s;pread through <HI>Attis,</HI> and his other pieces, which ought to have e&s;tabli&s;hed the reputation of QUINAULT, procured no credit to any per&s;on but LULLY, who was con&s;idered as another APOLLO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The in&s;tances of arrogance in LULLY in this way are incredible, When QUINAULT had written &s;ome &s;cenes of the opera of <HI>Phaeton,</HI> he &s;ubmitted them to the academy, who pa&s;&s;ed their judgment, and acquie&s;ed in the propriety of the alterations which were afterwards made. LULLY, however, cho&s;e to correct the piece a little more, from which critique he in&s;i&s;ted there &s;hould be no appeal, though he altered more than half of it.&mdash;Query then whether the harlequinades that Mr. VOLTAIRE complains of were not attributable to LULLY.&mdash;When THOMAS CORNEILLE wrote <HI>Bellerophon,</HI> LULLY teized him to death. He had twenty times an intention of giving up the work, and at la&s;t did not accompli&s;h it till he had written, out of com|plai&s;ance to this pre&s;uming mu&s;ician, more than two thou&s;and lines unnece&s;&s;arily.</NOTE>.</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="323">We have here from VOLTAIRE a pretty, lively picture, generally taken, of the opera, which I &s;hall take leave of for the pre&s;ent, to relea&s;e CORNEILLE from the ungracious &s;ituation in which we left him, and &s;ee what became of Thalia and Melpomene.</P>
<P>The extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s of <HI>Andromede,</HI> &s;o little to the ta&s;te or the reputation of its author, gave an entirely new complexion to tragedy, and it &s;eemed no longer to rely on its intrin&s;ic merits. Simplicity, beauty, &s;trength in the &s;tyle, art, ma|nagement, and conduct in the &s;ituations, and nature, force, and intere&s;t, in the incidents had nothing to do with the matter; the machines were the object, and the play was only a vehicle to introduce them.</P>
<P>What then mu&s;t become of CORNEILLE, who could neither paint flying dragons, nor mount a pa&s;teboard mermaid upon the back of a leathern

dolphin. He &s;eemed &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing with his prance in the air that when he came upon the ground he forgot how it was to walk naturally.</P>
<P>It is wonderful how men of the fir&s;t abilities will conform to bad ta&s;te. At that moment; alone, independent, adored by the public, and his re|putation at its &s;ummit, if CORNEILLE had met this innovation half way, if he had acknowledged that &s;cenery in FRANCE had been defective, that it was a grand, a &s;ober, a decorous appendage to tragedy, giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the action of the piece, and, therefore, proper to be encouraged, but that, neverthele&s;s, he &s;hould re&s;i&s;t with all his influ|ence the introduction of machines and other me|chanical operations, which, though ingenious in them&s;elves, di&s;graced tragedy, and lowered it to the level of pantomime; he would not only have kept his own &s;ame up to its legitimate &s;tandard, but all other writers, who &s;eeing CORNEILLE mi&s;led, were glad enough to have recour&s;e to this new ve|hicle to &s;ame to bol&s;ter up their own rickety re|putation, would have remained at their po&s;ts. By this means tragedy would have kept within the pale of its own province.</P>
<P>As it was, did CORNEILLE do this? No. If the Mountain had refu&s;ed to go to Mahomet, Mahomet
<PB N="321" REF="325">
would have been glad enough as formerly to have gone to the Mountain. But this was not the ca&s;e, CORNEILLE, immoveable, had he cho&s;e to have remained &s;o, fluctuated, trimmed, and accommo|dated him&s;elf to the caprice of the times.</P>
<P><HI>Andromede</HI> was followed up in 1651, by a heroic comedy called <HI>Don Sanche D'arragon;</HI> which, by the u&s;ual a&s;&s;i&s;tance of machines, had &s;ome eclat, but was &s;oon withdrawn and performed only in the provincial towns. This piece was not in the &s;tyle of CORNEILLE, being taken from two Spani&s;h plays, which had been fir&s;t romances, and it would have been better for his reputation if it had never been produced.</P>
<P>CORNEILLE him&s;elf attributes the want of &s;uc|ce&s;s in this piece to its having been prohibited. Why he does not tell us. His excu&s;es, however, are but lame, for he confe&s;&s;es that by his taking his piece from the Spani&s;h &s;tories he was entangled in the la&s;t act, that he was obliged to bring a man from the clouds to make the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;covery for the cata&s;trophe. The fact is, CORNEILLE giv|ing into the new ta&s;te turned projector. The piece is properly neither tragedy nor comedy, and, there|fore, heterogeneous and unworthy CORNEILLE.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="326"><HI>Nicomede,</HI> which came out in 1652, was another experiment. CORNEILLE &s;eems at this time to have grown tired. He owns that this piece is upon an extraordinary con&s;truction. <Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> &s;ays he,

This decla|ration might have &s;erved BOISROBERT, or RICHE|LIEU, but CORNEILLE &s;hould have di&s;dained it.</P>

<P>This piece, but for &s;ome applications to a popu|lar event, which parts of it contained, would have had but indifferent &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>Here he changed his real name for that of MO|LIERE, which circum&s;tance of changing names was extremely common in FRANCE among the poets and actors, but in MOLIERE is &s;aid actually to have ari&s;en from a fear of contaminating the race of valets des chambres and tape&s;try-makers, who thought it a greater honour to remain blockheads and receive chri&s;tian burial, than to amu&s;e and en|lighten mankind and be rewarded with a &s;entence of excommunication<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This di&s;tinction has been the parent of numberle&s;s plea&s;antries, &s;ome of which I &s;hall from time to time &s;et down.

This was in 1653, and its &s;ucce&s;s was &s;o prodigious that it fairly ruined the other company of comedians e&s;tabli&s;hed in that town; many of whom begged leave to join MOLIERE, who, with his company thus &s;trengthened, went to LANGUEDOC, and offered his &s;ervices to the Prince of CONTI, who then held his court at BEZIERS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Prince of CONTI who held MOLIERE in real e&s;timation, entreated him to remain with him in quality of &s;ecretary; but hap|pily for the French theatre, though he had the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e of the honour offered him, he preferred following the impul&s;e of his own genius.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This prince had known MOLIERE at college, and had not only been pre&s;ent when he performed at PARIS, but had very often invited him to his palace. <HI>L'Etourdi,</HI> with the protection of this prince, experienced at BEZIERS new &s;ucce&s;s. He

brought out al&s;o &s;ome farces, one of which was called <HI>Le Docteur Amoreux,</HI> and another <HI>Les Trois Docteurs;</HI> which, being trifles, he very properly afterwards &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Having travelled with his company to GRENO|BLE, he went fir&s;t to ROUEN, and afterwards to PARIS, where he determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to fix.

<P><HI>Le Depit Amoureux,</HI> which had been performed at BEZIERS in an imperfect &s;tate, was brought out at PARIS in 1658, with great &s;ucce&s;s; but <HI>Les Preci|&egrave;u&s;es Ridicules</HI> was the fir&s;t comedy that permanently fixed the reputation of MOLIERE.

<P><HI>The Preci&egrave;u&s;es Ridicules</HI> was performed at court, though the royal family were at that time on a journey to the PYRENEES. On their return the price to MOLIERE's theatre was doubled. Ad|mi&s;&s;ion to the parterre before that time had been only &s;ix &s;ols.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;peak of QUINAULT, who for a con|&s;iderable time was not allowed that &s;hare of merit he certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; nay, to this moment, &s;uch is the force of prejudice, that his name in the ge|neral idea of French literature is &s;eldom cla&s;&s;ed re&s;pectably, though there can be no doubt but that upon the whole he was the be&s;t lyric poet FRANCE ever knew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I &s;ay this I mean a writer of poetry proper for mu&s;ic; which, I take to be the true unadulterated &s;en&s;e of the word lyric; for taken to that extant which it often u&s;urps it is capable of any thing but harmony, and I could name lyric odes that if a compo&s;er were in&s;pired with the genius of APOLLO he would yet be incapable of &s;etting them to mu&s;ic.</NOTE>; a &s;pecious of merit &s;urely that &s;tands very high in the gradation of literary fame.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="334">We have &s;een already that VOLTAIRE con|&s;idered QUINAULT as a man of abilities. This opinion many other French writers have unequivo|cally confirmed, but a better proof, a peru&s;al of his works, will e&s;tabli&s;h for him that reputation which has been &s;o often denied him; for, in tho&s;e works, among a great deal of tra&s;h written to hu|mour LULLY, is to be found great and &s;triking poetical beauties, &s;uch as BOILEAU, with all his bitterne&s;s and invective again&s;t a man who had never offended him, had neither the &s;oul nor the capacity to write.</P>
<P>QUINAULT, however, in great mea&s;ure de&s;erved every &s;yllable that has been &s;aid again&s;t him. His permitting an arrogant, impudent mu&s;ician to appro|priate to him&s;elf quietly and comfortably that ge|nius and tho&s;e talents which were legitimately in the poet and not in him, was as unpardonable as it is inconceivable. But it &s;hould &s;eem that if LULLY laughed at QUINAULT, QUINAULT laughed at LULLY; for, pardoning every advantage the mu|&s;ician took on the &s;ide of reputation, the poet had
<PB N="331" REF="335">
his revenge on the &s;ide of profit, or rather prudence, for while LULLY di&s;&s;ipated his emoluments, QUIN|AULT took care of his affairs. He married the widow of a merchant, who had been his kind friend, with a fortune of forty thou&s;and crowns; he bought a con&s;iderable charge in the auditory of accounts; he was admitted into the French academy; he was honoured with the <HI>Cordon de St. Michel</HI>; and died in PARIS in 1688, at the age of fifty three, with a fortune of more than a hundred thou&s;and crowns.</P>
<P>As QUINAULT employed his talents more for the opera than the theatre, we &s;hall have but little to &s;ay of him at pre&s;ent. His tragedies, except <HI>L'A&s;trate,</HI> and <HI>L'Agrippa,</HI> have di&s;appeared from the theatre, and even tho&s;e are weakly written: his heroes are no more than gallants, and his &s;ubjects are no higher than pa&s;toral and romance. His comedies are &s;uperior to his tragedies, and his <HI>Mere Coquette,</HI> and one or two others, give good expectation that if he had pur&s;ued this &s;tyle of writing he would not have cut an incon&s;iderable figure even by the &s;ide of MOLIERE.</P>
<P>QUINAULT's fir&s;t piece for the regular theatre was a tragi-comedy called <HI>Les Rivales.</HI> It came
<PB N="332" REF="336">
out in 1653, and cau&s;ed a con&s;iderable change in the mode of recompencing dramatic authors for their labours. It had been the cu&s;tom to buy per|formances of authors for &s;uch prices as &s;hould be agreed upon, which was &s;ometimes regulated ac|cording to the merit, but oftener according to the reputation of the writer, for the merit and the re|putation are now and then di&s;tinct things. In ge|neral, however, the&s;e productions were &s;old low enough, the actors at that time having had the &s;ame hold of the authors in FRANCE as the book&s;ellers have now in ENGLAND.</P>
<P>This comedy of <HI>Les Rivales,</HI> which was little more than a copy from ROTROU, TRISTAN, of whom QUINAULT was the <HI>eleve,</HI> undertook to read to the ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ors under an idea that he could make a better bargain for his pupil than his pupil could have done for him&s;elf. The actors charmed with the piece, and upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that it was written by TRISTAN, offered a hundred crowns for it. Being undeceived, however, they told TRISTAN, that though QUINAULT appeared to have talents, yet as he had no e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation, they could not ri&s;k that &s;um for the piece, but would, at all ad|ventures, give fifty crowns; TRISTAN would not &s;uffer QUINAULT to accede to this, and the matter was compounded by an agreement to give the au|thor
<PB N="333" REF="337">
a ninth of every night's receipt during the run of the play, provided that afterwards it &s;hould be|long exclu&s;ively to the actors.</P>
<P>The&s;e terms were accepted, and the propo&s;al appeared &s;o fair and judicious, both on the part of authors and actors, that it has been &s;trictly ob&s;erved ever &s;ince; after-pieces, by way of proportion, bearing only the value, tho&s;e in two acts of a twelfth, and tho&s;e in one of an eighteenth.</P>
<P>QUINAULT after producing three plays with pa&s;&s;able &s;ucce&s;s, brought out, in 1656, a piece called <HI>Les Coups de L'amour and de Fortune;</HI> but SCAR|RON tells us that this play is not at all attributable to QUINAULT, for that TRISTAN wrote the fir&s;t four acts, and that he him&s;elf wrote the fifth after TRISTAN died.</P>

<P><HI>L'Ecolier de Salamanque,</HI> which came out in
<PB N="335" REF="339">
1654, gave ri&s;e to a mo&s;t bitter quarrel between SCARRON and BOISROBERT. SCARRON had a cu&s;tom of reading his works to his acquaintance, one of whom was BOISROBERT, who was &s;o &s;truck with the circum&s;tances of this play as he heard it piece meal, that he did not &s;cruple to build his <HI>Genereux Ennemis</HI> upon this foundation; which, indeed, was not all, for T. CORNEILLE worked <HI>The Genereu&s;e Ennemis</HI> into <HI>The Illu&s;tres Ennemis,</HI> and both the&s;e copies of SCARRON's play came out before the play it&s;elf; &s;o that it had to encounter all the di&s;advantage of the fir&s;t and &s;econd impre&s;&s;ion of it. But it did not &s;top here, for BOISROBERT did his utmo&s;t to decry the merit of <HI>L'Ecolier de Salamanque,</HI> and abu&s;ed SCARRON for &s;tealing it from him, whereas he knew the contrary to have been the fact.</P>
<P>This treatment SCARRON never pardoned; and, being a much better writer than BOISROBERT, he threw out his invectives again&s;t him in a &s;train of &s;uch &s;evere and bitter &s;atire that BOISROBERT felt their effects as long as he lived.</P>
<P>T. CORNEILLE during his brother's ab&s;ence ac|quired &s;ome celebrity. From my la&s;t accounts of him to 1659, he produced eight pieces. The fir&s;t three had merely pa&s;&s;able &s;ucce&s;s, and the fourth
<PB N="336" REF="340">
called <HI>Les Illu&s;tres Ennemis,</HI> was even le&s;s att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ended to on account of its being borrowed, as I have al|ready &s;aid from BOISROBERT, who &s;tole it from SCARRON. His fame from thence, however, be|gan to ri&s;e, and, indeed, to wear &s;o new an a&s;pect that he no longer &s;eemed to be the &s;ame writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has been charitably accounted for under an idea that his brother, having retired from the theatre, lent him a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is certainly very po&s;&s;ible that upon occa&s;ion he might have con&s;ulted his brother, and his brother him; for it is remarkable that no two brothers ever lived in clo&s;er union, nor had &s;o many natural and for|tuitous ties to bind this compact of affectionate alliance. They lived under the &s;ame roof, they married two &s;i&s;ters who&s;e ages had the &s;ame di&s;proportion as their own, each had exactly the &s;ame number of children as the other, and every thing relative to their fortunes was &s;o in common between them that they lived in this &s;tyle more than twenty years before they came to any &s;ettlement as to how their different affairs were &s;ituated, which would not, probably, even then have taken place had not prudence dictated what proportion ought honourably to be a&s;&s;igned to each, that their famil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">es might know what they had to depend upon in ca&s;e of death, or any ca&s;ual alter|ation in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ldren. All this is &s;o remark|able that it is impo&s;&s;ible but they mu&s;t have con&s;ulted each other in their writings; but yet it &s;hould &s;eem that it was merely as to opinion and nothing el&s;e, for never was there &s;o marked a difference between two writers; the great CORNEILLE had too &s;plendid a genius &s;ervily to buckle to regularity, and his brother had little more than that mea&s;ured regularity which never yet boa&s;ted the &s;plendour of genius.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The tide of T. CORNEILLE's reputation took a a mo&s;t extraordinary turn in 1656, when he pro|duced,
<PB N="337" REF="341">
<HI>Au Marais, Timocrate,</HI> which piece, though its merit is indi&s;putable, was &s;o eagerly followed and &s;o &s;uddenly dropt that the circum&s;tance will ever re|main a monument of French capriciou&s;ne&s;s. This tragedy was performed eighty times in regular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion without the intervention of a &s;ingle per|formance. For the la&s;t twelve or fourteen nights the actors attempted to announce other plays. The audience would not hear a &s;ingle &s;yllable. <HI>Timocrate</HI> was called for, and <HI>Timocrate</HI> they were ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">iged to perform.

<P>Nay, the circum&s;tance is &s;tronger yet. When
<PB N="338" REF="342">
this piece was in this extraordinary manner laid by at the theatre <HI>Au Marais.</HI> The company of the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> by infinite degrees the be&s;t per|formers, took it up; but there &s;eems to have been facination in the &s;tupid and impolic &s;peech of the actor ju&s;t mentioned; for after two or three inef|fectual attempts to attract the audience they totally withdrew it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s <HI>Timocrate</HI> is well &s;poken of. T. CORNEILLE's friends advi&s;ed him to &s;top there, for that his reputation was ratified. The king went to the theatre on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it, and &s;poke of it in the highe&s;t terms; and people in general began to declare that the retirement of the great CORNEILLE was no longer a lo&s;s to the theatre. By what I can learn it was a cold regular piece, and owed half its &s;ucce&s;s to the idea that the great CORNEILLE was concerned in it; for &s;o little did his friends con|tinue in opinion that it was his be&s;t production, that it is not among his works now printed, and I am told that it was lo&s;t to the world &s;oon after it was lo&s;t to the theatre.</P>
<P>T. CORNEILLE's next piece, <HI>Berenice,</HI> a tra|gedy, was brought out in 1657; he brought out <HI>Commode</HI> in 1658, and <HI>Darius</HI> in 1659. <HI>Commode</HI> was the greate&s;t favourite of the&s;e three but they

all received a reputable degree of applau&s;e.

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. FROM CORNEILLE'S RETURN TO 1663.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER <HI>Pertharite,</HI> CORNEILLE, as we have &s;een, retired from the &s;tage; and as every material trait in the character of &s;o great a man is of con&s;e|quence to the public, I hope it will not be con|&s;idered as extraneous if we &s;ee how he employed his time.</P>
<P>Having been all his life a devout chri&s;tian, and particularly intimate with &s;ome Je&s;uits, which body were ever remarkable for profound erudition and cla&s;&s;ical ta&s;te, he undertook at their particular in&s;tance to tran&s;late a celebrated work called <HI>The Imitation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which he is allowed to have rendered very finely. It had prodigious &s;ucce&s;s, and made him ample amends in point of profit for the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained by quitting the theatre. But the be&s;t judges agree that it was not a work properly in his &s;tyle, and the nature, the &s;implicity, and the truth of the original, was lo&s;t in that pomp and grandeur
<PB N="341" REF="345">
that every where pervaded the great mind of COR|NEILLE.</P>
<P>FONTENELLE &s;ays, in the true &s;tyle of a writer properly &s;killed in literary beauty,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This book, though for grandeur and force the fine&s;t that ever came from the hand of man, has &s;o little of the Evangeli&s;t that it cannot, like that, penetrate im|mediately to the heart, nor &s;eize the mind with that force, &s;o natural and tender, which &s;ome|times is greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a negligence of &s;tyle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That this is a truth every &s;u&s;ceptible mind mu&s;t bear me wit|ne&s;s; yet if it be a truth what becomes of VIRGIL and &s;o many others who have built reputations, adamantine reputations, upon Al|mighty &s;tyle. May I be &s;o fortunate before I quit this work to re&s;cue a little the cau&s;e of genius from the&s;e barbarous fetters, and to con|tribute a little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a very little I fear, to the &s;eperation of na|ture and truth from plau&s;ibility and &s;ophi&s;try.</NOTE>."</Q>
I hardly know if FONTENELLE complimented mo&s;t him&s;elf, by the candour, or CORNEILLE by the truth of this ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>It is not known whether it was by the per&s;ua&s;ion of his friends, or through the bent of his own pro|pen&s;ities, which after all mu&s;t have inclined him to|wards the &s;tage, that CORNEILLE was induced once more to take up the pen as a theatrical writer. Both the&s;e con&s;iderations might probably have had &s;ome
<PB N="342" REF="346">
weight, of which it is not impo&s;&s;ible but MOLIERE's rapid progre&s;s towards dramatic fame in &s;ome de|gree accelerated the preponderance.</P>
<P>It is certain, however, that FOUQUET, &s;uperin|tendant of the finances, applied very warmly to COR|NEILLE upon this occa&s;ion, and that his application was backed by others in power; nay, when the poet complained that he &s;hould find him&s;elf awkward in an employ to which he had been &s;ometime unac|cu&s;tomed, and remarked that he had not even thought of a &s;ubject, the financier, fertile in expe|dients, propo&s;ed three &s;ubjects; the fir&s;t of which he agreed to treat, the &s;econd he recommended to his brother, and we have no account of what the third was, or whether it was adopted or not.</P>
<P><HI>Oedipe,</HI> which had prodigious &s;ucce&s;s, completely reconciled CORNEILLE to the theatre and the pub|lic. <HI>La Toi&s;on D'or</HI> was performed in 1660; and here I am obliged already to remark that COR|NEILLE could not with all his merit re&s;i&s;t that furor for machinery and decoration which then raged in FRANCE; for on the contrary he allied him&s;elf with the very marquis DE SOURDEAC, of whom we have heard VOLTAIRE &s;peak with &s;uch contempt.</P>
<P><HI>The Toi&s;on D'or</HI> was performed originally at the
<PB N="343" REF="347">
<HI>Chateau de Neubourg,</HI> in NORMANDY, at the &s;eat of the marquis DE SOURDEAC, in honour of the mar|riage of LOUIS the Fourteenth, and the peace with SPAIN. This nobleman, be&s;ides the per&s;ons ne|ce&s;&s;ary to execute the different departments of this &s;pectacle, entertained five hundred gentlemen of that province for two months at his own expence, during which time the <HI>Toi&s;on D'or</HI> was repre&s;ented every day.</P>
<P>In <HI>Sertorius,</HI> performed in 1662, CORNEILLE appeared more him&s;elf. It was greatly admired and de&s;ervedly. It di&s;plays a magnificent portrait of Ro|man grandeur, in which the &s;entiments, the manners, the very minds of tho&s;e ferocious heroes are de|picted in a &s;tyle peculiarly vernacular; but, in|deed, in treating Roman &s;ubjects, CORNEILLE is every where at home. Mar&s;hal TURENNE is &s;aid to have exclaimed at the repre&s;entation of this piece,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Where could CORNEILLE have learnt &s;o per|fectly the art of war."</Q></P>
<P>BOILEAU, however, never contented, will have it that the &s;cene between POMPEY and SERTORIUS, which FONTENELLE, who by the by was a better writer and a more &s;en&s;ible man, thinks one of the fine&s;t in the French language, did not de&s;erve to have been &s;o much applauded. <Q REND="inline">"It is full of

&s;pirit,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I grant; but it has neither rea&s;on nor nature to &s;upport it, for who to SERTORIUS, an old and experienced captain, would compare POMPEY, who is hardly man enough to have a beard<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I &s;hould not have noticed this &s;illy remark of DESPRFAUX, were it not that I am happy at all times to expo&s;e envious cavil, and ignorant ill nature.

If the remark of this &s;narling &s;atire&s;t be admitted what becomes of the glory of ALEXANDER, CHARLES the Twelfth of SWEDEN, and all tho&s;e heroes who atchieved wonders and yet died before they attained the prime of life. But this will ever be the way with tho&s;e who cavil at what they cannot imitate. It is difficult to admire real merit in an author while you are obliged to de&s;pi&s;e the man. But in BOILEAU, and I don't de&s;pair of proving it, you mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e both the man and the writer; and nothing can more fully prove that he was neither born a poet nor a philanthropi&s;t, than his Art of Poetry, the &s;ervile echo of an echo, where the only truth to be found is his pretended mode&s;t declaration, which he would not have made had he expected it to have been believed, that the poem has no other merit than being decked in the &s;poils of HORACE.</NOTE>."</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophoni&s;ba</HI> was the next tragedy produced by CORNEILLE; it came out in 1663. This &s;ubject had been treated frequently on the French theatre, and there can be no doubt but the original model was a tragedy, under the &s;ame title, written in Ita|lian by the Prelate TRISSINO, &s;o early as 1514, af|terwards
<PB N="345" REF="349">
imitated by MARMET, MONCHRETIEN, DE MONTREUX, and MAIRET, or, as has been already explained, VIAUD THEOPHILE, which la&s;t piece kept the &s;tage with celebrity.</P>
<P>On this account CORNEILLE has been blamed for bringing out a tragedy on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and, indeed, envy, at the &s;ucce&s;s of MAIRET, has been kindly con&s;idered as his motive; but not only the known character of CORNEILLE contradicts this invidious report, it is completely refuted by his own declaration, in which he pays a compliment to his predece&s;&s;or more flattering to his reputation than the play was capable of procuring him, and which he ought to have been very proud of, even van|qui&s;hed as he was by his more able competitor.</P>
<P>But let us look after MOLIERE. It &s;hould be known that MOLIERE occupied with his company, a third theatre <HI>Au Petit Bourbon,</HI> with the permi&s;&s;ion of the king, where he performed alternately with the Italians, of whom I &s;hall at a proper time give the hi&s;tory. This theatre was afterwards pulled down to build the grand entrance to the <HI>Louvre,</HI> and the king then took him into the Palais Royal, fir&s;t called his company <HI>La Troupe de Mon&s;ieur,</HI> and afterwards <HI>La Troupe du Roi.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Don Garcia de Navarre</HI> was produced in 1661, MOLIERE performed the part of DON GAR|CIA; and finding that &s;erious acting was by no means his forte, had the good &s;en&s;e to make a re|&s;olution not to perform any but comic parts from that time. This piece, which was a heroic co|medy, though cha&s;tely written, did not &s;ucceed; and the reputation of MOLIERE, through the in|du&s;try of his enemies, of whom he had at all times unde&s;ervedly a plentiful number, &s;uffered for a time from this di&s;grace. A &s;hort time, however, for the &s;ucce&s;s of his next piece amply con&s;oled him for the mortification he had &s;u&s;tained by the fall of this.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="351"><HI>L'Ecole des Maris</HI> made its appearance in 1661. It was the fir&s;t piece that MOLIERE brought out at the theatre <HI>du Palais Royal,</HI> and the fir&s;t that he printed. In quality of chief of the company of Mon&s;ieur, he, therefore, dedicated it to that prince.</P>
<P>This comedy, which &s;erved as a model for Engli&s;h and other authors, is taken from a <HI>Tale</HI> by BOCACE, which every body knows. The only dif|ference in the two plots is that, in BOCACE, a wo|man in love with a young man makes her confe&s;&s;or the go-between, who carries letters and pre&s;ents un|der an idea that he &s;erves the purpo&s;es of devotion; and, in MOLIERE, an old man is &s;ub&s;tituted for the confe&s;&s;or, who is duped in the &s;ame manner by a girl he is in love with and to whom he is the tutor.</P>
<P><HI>L'Ecole des Femmes,</HI> MOLIERE's next comedy, was performed for the fir&s;t time in 1662. So di|vided began to be the French at this time as to MOLIERE; that under the idea, probably, of his commencing ARISTOPHANES, and i&s;&s;uing per&s;on|alities from the &s;tage, whereas he in fact per&s;onated men only by per&s;onating manners, he &s;u&s;tained all &s;orts of affronts.

cabals induced MOLIERE in the following year to write a piece which he called <HI>L'Critique de L'Ecole des Femmes.</HI></P>
<P>This piece was the fir&s;t of the kind that ever appeared on the French theatre. It is rather a dialogue than a comedy; MOLIERE, however, is to be commended for having written it, for he very happily, while he points out the faults of his play, turns its enemies into ridicule. <HI>The Mercure Galant,</HI> conducted by a man of the name of VISE, who was con&s;tantly &s;ticking in MOLIERE's &s;kirts, has the kindne&s;s thus to critici&s;e this piece by anticipation.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We are to &s;ee in a &s;hort time a piece entitled <HI>La Critique de L'Ecole des Femmes,</HI> where the au|thor, <HI>&s;oi di&s;ant,</HI> is to enumerate all the faults in his piece, and to excu&s;e them at the &s;ame time. Curious, that a man &s;hould take &s;o much pains to defend a piece which is not his own, but written by the Abb&eacute; du BUISSON, who is one of the mo&s;t gallant men of the age. But MOLIERE has the audicity to deny this. He &s;ays that the Abb&eacute; certainly did write a piece on this &s;ubject and bring it to him, and that he could not help allowing it con&s;iderable merit, though he had his rea&s;ons for not performing it. What does all this &s;ay? That this cunning comedian, who&s;e be&s;t merit is to know how to take advantage, di&s;|cerned
<PB N="349" REF="355">
in the Abb&eacute;'s piece &s;omething that could plea&s;e the public, and &s;o palmed it upon them as his own."</Q></P>
<P>The Abb&eacute; might have written a piece upon this &s;ubject, but it was perfectly unnece&s;&s;ary that MO|LIERE &s;hould copy that piece, for he had only to go to the &s;ame &s;ource where the Abb&eacute; derived his ma|terials, which was a book entitled <HI>Le Nuits facetieu&s;es du Seigneur Straparole;</HI> which is a hi&s;tory of a man who communicates to his friend all that pa&s;&s;es be|tween him and his mi&s;tre&s;s, not knowing that his friend is his rival.</P>
<P>But it now became pitiable to &s;ee pieces on the theatres in the &s;hape of disjointed critiques; and really it is to be regretted that MOLIERE, in imi|tation of the &s;un when the flies wanted to put him out, did not &s;hine on in&s;tead of conde&s;cending to notice the &s;warm of tiny critics that &s;urrounded him. As it was, the cabal again&s;t him, though it did not injure him, gave him great inconvenience, and more than one critique, which would have died away forgotten, became noticeable to the public by his pointing it out.</P>
<P>BOURSAULT, a writer of real merit, and who was now coming forward, took occa&s;ion to render
<PB N="350" REF="356">
him&s;elf popular by bringing out at the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> a piece called <HI>Le Portrait du Peintre,</HI> which was not only a critique of <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes,</HI> but produced at the &s;ame time; and contained, as far as he could learn or imagine, the &s;ame matter of MOLIERE's piece under that title<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This the reader &s;ees was no difficult matter; for nothing could be ea&s;ier than to &s;elect the known and acknowledged faults of <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes</HI> and excu&s;e them exactly the way that its author would do. This was what &s;truck BOURSAULT, who &s;ucceeded &s;o well in his de&s;ign that at la&s;t it was &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d, in addition to MOLIERE's having &s;tolen his <HI>Ecole des Femmes</HI> from L'ABBE DU BUISSON, he &s;tole his critique of <HI>L'Ecole des Femmes</HI> from BOURSAULT.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MOLIERE now began really to be piqued, and he brought out in the &s;ame year his <HI>Inprompt&ucirc; de Ver&s;ailles,</HI> levelled directly at BOURSAULT, whom he treated with the greate&s;t contempt and deri&s;ion; re&s;erving to him&s;elf, however, a degree of noblene&s;s; for this contempt, and this deri&s;ion went no further than the genius and talents of BOURSAULT, whereas BOURSAULT has de&s;cended in his &s;trictures on MO|LIERE to attack his private character.</P>
<P>This piece al&s;o is a mo&s;t &s;evere and &s;ucce&s;sful &s;atire on the performers at the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> whom MOLIERE con&s;iders as having in&s;tigated BOURSAULT to ridicule him; and, indeed, though
<PB N="351" REF="357">
no one could commend this &s;pirit of party between two bodies who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was only to entertain the public, yet MOLIERE received and de&s;erved great prai&s;e for the able manner in which he conducted this controver&s;y; for, in an&s;wer to their pityful invec|tives which he &s;corned to imitate, he contented him|&s;elf with pointing out their faults as performers, par|ticularly the &s;leepy monotony of their declamation, which he did with &s;uch judgment that the ridicule which followed this di&s;covery drove them into a cor|ner and they were obliged to correct their faults or be laughed at; and thus MOLIERE, in re&s;enting a private injury, did a public benefit.</P>
<P>BOURSAULT, whom I &s;hall now introduce, was one of tho&s;e extraordinary proofs that &s;hew us how infinitely genius ranks before education. He was born at BOURGOGNE in 1638, and died in PARIS in 1701. We find him at the age of twenty-three bringing out &s;ucce&s;sful comedies, and two years afterwards entering into a controver&s;y with a man of MOLIERE's wonderful talents, though he could &s;peak nothing but a provincial jargan called Patois, no more like French than Er&s;e or Iri&s;h is to Engli&s;h, at thirteen, and had then fir&s;t to learn to write, and afterwards to chu&s;e what language he &s;hould write in.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="358">It was not long, however, after he came to PARIS, which was in 1651, before he taught him&s;elf to write and &s;peak French elegantly; and, what may appear very extraordinary, without knowing a word of Greek or Latin, his &s;tyle was fraught with the native purity of the ancients. But I cannot find any thing irreconcileable in this. Nature taught them, nature taught him. Neither they nor he had been tainted with the foppery of the &s;chools.</P>
<P>His conception was &s;o &s;trong, his ideas were &s;o true, and his fancy was &s;o pliant, that he had nothing to do but to think and write. His happy genius accommodated it&s;elf to every &s;tyle. His tragedies manife&s;t a firm mind and a &s;trength of conception equal to a de&s;cription of the noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ions. His comedies contain lively pictures of men and man|ners &s;uitable &s;o all ranks, all ages, and all times. He is &s;erious, comic, moral, and lively without vio|lating the rules of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t now be recollected that I am &s;peaking of his be&s;t and late&s;t productions. In his early ones, there is certainly, and it would be wonderful if there were not a great deal of tra&s;h; but there are traits of genius every where, and he arrived at la&s;t to a ta&s;te &s;o pure, and a &s;tyle &s;o cha&s;te, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was
<PB N="353" REF="359">
correct without affectation,"</Q>
to u&s;e the words of various French writers,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"and ought to be con&s;idered as the literary lawgiver to the language of that nation."</Q></P>
<P>There is &s;omething &s;o peculiar in a character of this de&s;cription that I cannot help dwelling on BOURSAULT a little longer. His fame &s;oon reached the court, and having at the expre&s;s de&s;ire of LOUIS the Fourteenth, written a book called <HI>La Veritable Etude des Soverains,</HI> by the way a bold undertaking, the king was &s;o charmed with it that he appointed him preceptor of Mon&s;eigneur, but he could not ratify the appointment becau&s;e BOURSAULT knew nothing of Latin, an indi&s;pen&s;ible qualification for that po&s;t.</P>
<P>The Duche&s;s of ANGOULEME made BOUR|SAULT her &s;ecretary, and engaged him to write a Weekly Gazette in ver&s;e. LOUIS and his court were greatly entertained with this work, but BOUR|SAULT having aimed &s;ome &s;atiric tracts again&s;t the Franci&s;cans in general, and the Capucins in parti|cular, the queen's confe&s;&s;or u&s;ed &s;uch powerful in|tere&s;t that the Gazette was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the au|thor's pen&s;ion of two thou&s;and livres taken away, and had not very high friends interfered this poetical new&s;monger would have gone to the Ba&s;tile.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="360">All the time BOURSAULT had this controver&s;y with MOLIERE, in which there is certainly a great deal of the vivacity and folly of a young man, he had be&s;ides his <HI>Portrait du Peintre,</HI> brought out three pieces, all which &s;ucceeded. They had, however, glaring faults, but gave wonderful promi&s;e of &s;ome|thing better.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. FURTHER SUCCESS AND DEATH OF MOLIERE.</HEAD>
<P>AS MOLIERE's career for the next ten years, at the end of which he died, makes up a very brilliant interval in the French dramatics, I &s;hall follow it unmixed with any other circum&s;tances but &s;uch as re&s;ult from it, in order to do every ju&s;tice to a man of &s;uch uncommon merit.</P>
<P><HI>La Prince&s;&s;e D'Elide</HI> was performed in 1664, and made up a part of tho&s;e &s;uperb entertainments which LOUIS the fourteenth, in compliment to his mother and his own queen, gave under the title of <HI>Des Plai&s;irs L'I&s;le enchant&eacute;e.</HI> The&s;e fetes, which continued &s;even days, and were conducted with great magnificence and ta&s;te, united all that could be got together of the true and the marvellous, in &s;hort, a kind of entremets regulated and di&s;po&s;ed &s;o as not to outrage the under&s;tanding. The Italian VIGARANI, an ingenious mechani&s;t, furni&s;hed the decorations, the celebrated LULLY compo&s;ed
<PB N="356" REF="362">
the mu&s;ic, the Pre&s;ident de PERIGNY wrote the complimentary odes, BENSERADE produced a va|riety of light and lively eulogiums, and MOLIERE introduced this comedy, all which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of various appropriate devices and well timed ap|plications, contributed to render this f&ecirc;te very celebrated.</P>
<P>The king gave MOLIERE but a very &s;hort time to prepare his comedy. He borrowed the fable from <HI>Augu&s;tin Moreta,</HI> and was &s;o pre&s;&s;ed that he could only put the fir&s;t act and part of the &s;econd into ver&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Le Mariage Forc&eacute;</HI> was performed in 1664. This piece originally came out at the Louvre, ac|companied by a ballet under the &s;ame title, in which LOUIS the fourteenth danced<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The famous Count de GRAMMONT furni&s;hed MOLIERE with the idea of the <HI>Mariage Force.</HI> This nobleman, while he re|&s;ided in LONDON, fell in love with a young lady of the name of HAMILTON. Their amours even made &s;ome noi&s;e; when, on a &s;udden, he &s;et out for FRANCE without taking leave of the family. The brother of the young lady, who now began to look upon the affair as a little equivocal, followed the count to DOVER with a de|termination to call him to account. He encountered him before he had opportunity to embark, and a&s;ked, in a tone which &s;ufficiently gave him to under&s;tand what he was at, whether he had not forgot &s;ome|thing at LONDON? The count, who, perhaps, was a&s;hamed of him|&s;elf and glad of an opportunity to attone for his conduct, an&s;wered with perfect good humour,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You are certainly in the right. I really forgot to marry your &s;i&s;ter, but to convince you how glad I am that you put me in mind of it, I'll return with you and offer her my hand."</Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="363"><HI>Le Fe&s;tin de Pierre</HI> made its appearance as written by MOLIERE in 1665. This &s;trange &s;ub|ject has been &s;o often treated, and in &s;o many lan|guages and &s;hapes, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay much about it. It was fir&s;t brought out on the Italian &s;tage, afterwards on the Spani&s;h, then on the French, by at lea&s;t five authors, MOLIERE and T. COR|NEILLE two of them, and at la&s;t the Engli&s;h, who&s;e good &s;en&s;e would have revolted at witne&s;&s;ing a re|pre&s;entation of it in dialogue, have contented them&s;elves with &s;eeing this abominable &s;ubject danced throughout the kingdom from the opera to all the puppet &s;hews. MOLIERE has neverthele&s;s thrown great &s;trength and beauty into this horrid piece, on purpo&s;e, one &s;hould imagine, to &s;hew that the wor&s;t &s;ubject may be treated well by a good ma&s;ter of his art.</P>
<P><HI>L'Amour Medecin</HI> came out in 1665. MOLIERE all his life had been an enemy to all the tribe of GALEN. His motives have been variou&s;ly attri|buted, but it is mo&s;t probable that they originated from his inveterate hatred to every &s;pecies of hy|pocricy.

He defines a phy&s;ician to be a man who chatters non&s;en&s;e in the bed-chambers of the &s;ick either till nature has cured, or phy&s;ic killed the pa|tient. To give this piece all the effect he could, MOLIERE had ma&s;ques which were likene&s;&s;es of all the court phy&s;icians, and tho&s;e he wore as he repre|&s;ented different medical characters.</P>
<P>The names al&s;o pointed out who were meant. <HI>Desfonandres,</HI> which &s;ignifies man-killer, was meant for De FOUGERAIS, who always pre&s;cribed violent medicines; <HI>Bahis,</HI> which &s;ignifies to yelp, was de|&s;igned for M.

<P><HI>Le Mi&s;anthrope</HI> in five acts, and in ver&s;e, was performed for the fir&s;t time in 1666. This piece failed at its fir&s;t repre&s;entation; but MOLIERE with|drew it and brought it forward again in a month preceded by the <HI>Fagotier, or M&eacute;decin malgre lui;</HI> which had &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s that it was performed three months in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but always with <HI>The Mi&s;an|thrope.</HI> The farce &s;aved the comedy.</P>
<P>This play, however, &s;oon made its way by its

own proper merit. It has not only been con&s;idered as the be&s;t of MOLIERE's productions but the be&s;t comedy ever written; but enthu&s;ia&s;tic prai&s;e is in general an injury to authors. MOLIERE's enemies who could not bear this warmth in his adherents, &s;et them&s;elves to work every way to lower his piece in the opinion of the public. Ridiculou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">y enough, however, and without &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other endeavours to injure MOLIERE, an effort was made to per&s;uade the Due de MONTAUS<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">E, who was remarkable for the au&s;terity of his manners, that in the <HI>Mi&s;anthr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">pe</HI> MOLIERE had attempted to draw his character.

<P><HI>Melicerte,</HI> a heroic pa&s;toral, made its appearance in 1666. MOLIERE wrote only the fir&s;t and &s;econd acts of this piece, and in that unfini&s;hed &s;tate it was performed at St. GERMAIN. It was afterwards en|larged by GUERIN, &s;on to the actor of that name, but neither then, nor before, was it con&s;idered as a dramatic production of much con&s;equence.</P>
<P><HI>Le Tartuffe,</HI> a comedy in five acts, and in ver&s;e, came out in 1667. Nothing, perhaps, ever made more noi&s;e than this comedy; nor was ever thea|trical repre&s;entation more &s;everely per&s;ecuted. Fops, phy&s;icians, mi&s;ers, fools, and other general
<PB N="360" REF="366">
characters, were even &s;een to laugh at them&s;elves, and ki&s;s the very hand from which they received their ca&s;tigation; but hypocrites are a &s;pecies of men, more vindictive and more numerous, con&s;e|quently more &s;evere and more powerful.</P>
<P>The hypocrites took this comedy as a decla|ration of war again&s;t human nature; for where is there to be found, &s;aid they, a body of men among whom hypocricy is not practi&s;ed? In &s;hort this ex|po&s;ition was a crime not to be pardoned, and the piece was be&s;et with an indu&s;try and &s;everity incre|dible. It was artfully in&s;inuated that it attacked re|ligion; that the <HI>Tartuffe</HI> was an impious in&s;ult again&s;t GOD him&s;elf; that it was abominable, and that it ought to be burnt by the hands of the hangman.</P>
<P>The three fir&s;t acts of the <HI>Tartuffe</HI> having been privately repre&s;ented before the king on the twelfth of May, 1664, his maje&s;ty defended MO|LIERE again&s;t his per&s;ecutors, and that this might have the better colour, he ordered that the piece &s;hould be examined by the mo&s;t celebrated writers of the time, who&s;e determination in its favour he be&s;poke by &s;aying that he him&s;elf &s;ound nothing in it but what was perfectly harmle&s;s, and, indeed, meritorious.</P>
<P>The hypocrites finding MOLIERE &s;o greatly

&s;upported, were indefatigable to procure a cabal again&s;t the <HI>Tartuffe;</HI> for they in&s;i&s;ted, after all, that neither kings nor learned men, but the public alone, were to judge of dramatic repre&s;entations.&mdash;Devo|tees were con&s;ulted, who being generally weak men, joined &s;incerely in a cau&s;e which they thought did honour to religion and virtue. A poor infatuated curate undertook, at all hazards, to pronounce that it was a work full of profanene&s;s and impiety, and that in quality of prie&s;t he had a right to anathema|tize the author.</P>
<P>The king, on the other hand, permitted the piece to be performed, but in order to qualify the matter&mdash;for though he di&s;approved of his people's folly, he wi&s;hed to conciliate their affection&mdash;he advi&s;ed that it &s;hould be called <HI>L'impo&s;teur,</HI> and that the prin|cipal character &s;hould appear as one of the laiety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is certain that MOLIERE, who was always a &s;pectator at the farce of the <HI>world,</HI> took many traits of his <HI>Tartuffe</HI> from real life. The very name which &s;ignifies hypocrite, or more properly fal&s;e de|vout, owed its ri&s;e to an accident. MOLIERE being in the palace of the Pope's nuncio during the time he worked at his piece, which was then intended to be called <HI>The Impo&s;tor,</HI> he was walking in the cloi&s;ier with two eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who were holding forth on the piety, the for|bearance, and the ab&s;temiou&s;ne&s;s of the nuncio. During the in|tervals of conver&s;ations, however, &s;ome few hints concerning the bill of fare for the day, gave MOLIERE a &s;trong idea that the re|pre&s;entative of his holine&s;s had &s;ome little regard for the good things of this world as well as the next. At length he under&s;tood that one very high and expen&s;ive di&s;h, that was generally &s;erved up to dinner, would that day lo&s;e much of its poignancy, for want of &s;ome truffles, of which they were di&s;appointed.

One of the courtiers &s;miled at this, the rea&s;on of which, after the prelate had retired, the king in&s;i&s;ted upon his explaining. The courtier &s;aid he could not avoid &s;miling to think that the prelate &s;hould call &s;uch a dinner as they were going to receive an indifferent one. Though, in|deed, it was not &s;o good as the good bi&s;hop often &s;at down to, even when alone. On this he rehear&s;ed the particulars of the bill of fare. At the mention of every luxury, the king cried out, each time in a different tone, <HI>the poor man.</HI> MOLIERE, who attended in quality as <HI>Valet de Chambre,</HI> overheard this &s;cene, and &s;o availed him&s;elf of the circum&s;tance, as to introduce the effect of it into the piece, at which the king, when he was informed of it at VERSAILLES, laughed heartily.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>BENSERADE had attacked MOLIERE on account of the jealou&s;y that had taken place at the time of the <HI>Fete</HI> at VERSAILLES in 1664.

<P><HI>Les Femmes S&ccedil;avantes,</HI> a comedy in five acts, and in ver&s;e, was produced in 1672, and very &s;hortly be|came celebrated.

This drew on him a thou&s;and &s;quibs, par|ticularly from MENAGE, L'ABBE COTIN, and Madame de RAM|BOUILLET. About this time COTIN had a di&s;pute with DESPREAUX, whom he loaded with the mo&s;t injurious language; and, among other things, &s;aid that he acknowledged neither GOD, nor Faith, nor law. Unfortunately for him he lugged MOLIERE, into the di&s;pute, who re&s;olved to give him no quarter. He, therefore, put the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the <HI>Femmes Scavantes,</HI> where he drew on COTIN a ridicule and a contempt, that &s;tuck by him as long as he lived. One circum&s;tance in particular rendered him completely ridiculous. MOLIERE was determined to make COTIN, under his title in the piece of Tri&s;&s;otin, or three times &s;ool, produce a &s;onnet as ignorant and ludicrous as po&s;&s;ible. BOILEAU hearing of this produced for MOLIERE a &s;onnet actually written by COTIN, as a compliment to Madame de NE|MOURS, which was in every re&s;pect as contemptible as they could wi&s;h. This being introduced, and afterwards made known as the real production of COTIN, it may very ea&s;ily be conceived how it operated with the public.</NOTE>.</P>

MOLIERE replied, that he con&s;idered it as his duty to render vice hideous, and that it redounded to his honour to ca&s;tigate the manners. The &s;atyri&s;t, probably piqued that he had not &s;ucceeded, cried out

<P>He grew better about noon, and prepared for the performance; and by the time he appeared on the theatre, the concern of his friends was a good deal di&s;&s;ipated.

<P>The rank MOLIERE held in literature has been

long e&s;timated and decided. We have nothing to do but to compare his works with whatever we know of, perfect and admirable, in the ancients, and we &s;hall find him in every point of view ri&s;ing greatly &s;uperior to them all. He has all the pointed &s;everity of ARISTOPHANES, without his wickedne&s;s and his malignity; he has to the beauty, the fidelity, the por|traiture of MENANDER, added higher and more fini&s;hed graces of his own; he has the nerve and &s;trength of PLAUTUS without his gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and his ob&s;cenity; and he has a thou&s;and times more ele|gance from nature and genius, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by philo&s;ophic ob&s;ervation, than TERENCE.</P>
<P>Nature, and the ab&s;urdities of the age in which he lived, &s;upplied him with an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of materials. Comedy took a new form in his hands, and became a &s;courge for the vices and follies of all ranks, to the truth of which all were implicitly obliged to &s;ub&s;cribe; and there can be but little doubt, if he could have written independantly, and have been independantly attended, but he would have carried comedy, true comedy as correct as it can be defined, to a higher degree of perfection than any author has done either before or &s;ince.</P>
<P>MOLIERE, however, was a reformer; and reformers in any way dare not innovate all at once. Could he have done this, he would have written no dialogue in ver&s;e, he would have made his characters at once

Pure morality would proba|bly have been laughed at by a people full of intrigue and given up to every licentiou&s;ne&s;s; on this account, and I mo&s;t &s;incerely believe on no other, did MO|LIERE introduce his naive and natural humour, his &s;trong remarks, and his &s;terling truths, through me|diums which neither his heart nor his under&s;tand|ing at all times approved.</P>
<P>To make children ridicule their parents, deride their ob&s;ervations, laugh at their age, and in&s;ult their infirmities, are circum&s;tances true comedy &s;hould re|ject with contempt; to introduce adultery, and en|deavour, by &s;ubtle devices and in&s;inuating per&s;ua&s;ion, to imprint on young minds a love of vice, is revolt|ing to true comedy; to recommend knavery, by giv|ing it a fa&s;hionable air, and permitting it at la&s;t to triumph over &s;implicity and hone&s;ty, has nothing to do with true comedy; <Q REND="inline">"but,"</Q> &s;ays a French author,

It was nece&s;&s;ary to make the pit laugh. Oh that &s;o great a genius &s;hould be &s;unk to &s;o low a degree of humiliation."</Q></P>
<P>If, however, vice, through MOLIERE, became at times winning and &s;educing, he did not fail at other

times to expo&s;e it to contempt and ridicule; but, whenever he did &s;o, it was &s;ure to rai&s;e him up a ho&s;t of enemies. This, in his dependent &s;ituation, as we have &s;een, gave him throughout his life a thou&s;and vexations, and induced him &s;ometimes to conform to the age rather than revolt again&s;t it. In &s;hort, when he con&s;idered him&s;elf merely as a poet, he fell into the errors of poets; when as a philo&s;opher, he &s;hone with all the truth of a morali&s;t, and the dignity of a man.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t. As an actor he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a noble figure, a marking and an expre&s;&s;ive face, and a clear and commanding voice; through the&s;e he conveyed the utmo&s;t force of comic expre&s;&s;ion into his cha|racters, regulated by an under&s;tanding correct, powerful, and commanding. As a manager he made it the &s;tudy of his life to con&s;ider the intere&s;t of all tho&s;e who were embarked with him in his under|taking, according to their re&s;pective abilities. He tempered authority with indulgence, determination with affability, and con&s;idered him&s;elf at the head of his company, as the father of a family by whom he was beloved and revered.</P>
<P>As a man, he was an affectionate hu&s;band and a warm friend; hone&s;t, punctual, and ju&s;t. He was admired by the great, e&s;teemed and valued by his equals, and almo&s;t adored by his inferiors, to whom as far as his abilities permitted, he was a generous benefactor.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. RACINE AND THE STAGE TO THE DEATH OF CORNEILLE.</HEAD>
<P>AS RACINE ran the principal part of his career during the life of CORNEILLE, it would be totally out of regularity to omit an account of that ad|mirable poet and his works in this place; e&s;pecially as the new turn he gave to dramatic productions, inclined, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, his fluctuating country|men to neglect his great competitor, who&s;e infinitely &s;uperior abilities had created what remained for RA|CINE to perfect.</P>
<P>JEAN RACINE was born at FERTE-MILON, De|cember, 1639. At what age he went to &s;chool hi&s;|torians are not agreed upon; but one &s;hould &s;up|po&s;e not very young, for it is in&s;i&s;ted that in le&s;s than a year he read <HI>Sophocles,</HI> and <HI>Euripides,</HI> with ta&s;te in their own language. He is &s;aid to have manife&s;ted early in life an extraordinary genius for poetry, and that his memory &s;urpa&s;&s;ed any thing that ever was heard of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having met with the Romance of <HI>Theagenes and Clariclea,</HI> written by HELIODORUS, his in&s;tructor CLAUDE LAUNCELOT, threw it into the fire. RACINE found means to get at a &s;econd copy, which &s;hared the &s;ame fate. He then bought a third; and having taken a &s;hort time to examine it, took it to his ma&s;ter and told him that he might al&s;o burn that for he had now got it by heart.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="389">The poetic merit of RACINE appeared evidently in a variety of minor productions, though his Latin poetry injured his reputation, thanks, probably, to tho&s;e pedants who are the only judges of the beauty of a language no longer &s;poken. At length, in 1660, the king's marriage &s;et all the poets at work; and upon this occa&s;ion RACINE produced a poem called <HI>La Nymphe de la Scine,</HI> that bore away the palm from all its competitors. RACINE from this time deli|vered him&s;elf up entirely to poetry, except when out of complai&s;ance to his uncle, with whom he lived, he dipped into theology. Neither that &s;tudy, how|ever, nor logic, to which he had deeply attended, could prevent him from giving way to his poetic propen&s;ity; and becoming acquainted with MO|LIERE, and afterwards with BOILEAU, he deter|mined to try his hand at the drama.</P>
<P><HI>Th&eacute;baide,</HI> RACINE's fir&s;t piece, came out in 1664, for which piece MOLIERE is &s;aid to have furni&s;hed him with the materials. This, however, cannot be true, for when it appeared it was little more than a revi&s;ion of <HI>L'Antigone</HI> of ROTROU, which RACINE had adju&s;ted to the theatre, thinking he could not do better than re&s;cue a good performance from ob&s;cu|rity. Afterwards, however, he altered it con&s;idera|bly, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his ver&s;e, which was at all times correct and harmonious, it became ce|lebrated.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="390"><HI>Alexandre</HI> appeared in 1666. RACINE read this tragedy to CORNEILLE, who told him very hone&s;tly, for CORNEILLE was incapable of jealou&s;y, that he &s;aw in it wonderful talents for poetry, but not for tra|gedy. RACINE brought out this piece at MOLIERE's theatre. It was damned. He was afterwards pre|vailed on to offer it to the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne</HI>; where, with a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Madmoi&s;elle PARC, one of MO|LIERE's be&s;t actre&s;&s;es who was enticed away from him upon this occa&s;ion, it had good &s;ucce&s;s. This treachery begat a coldne&s;s between MOLIERE and RACINE which la&s;ted as long as they lived, though it has always been allowed they upon all occa&s;ions did each other ju&s;tice as authors.</P>
<P><HI>Andromache</HI> came out in 1667. This tragedy is re|markable for having occa&s;ioned two extraordinary cir|cum&s;tances. Madamoi&s;elle CHAMPEMELE, of whom RACINE had a very indifferent opinion, &s;o won him that he fell violently in love with her; and MONT|FLEURY, in endeavouring to per&s;onate ORESTES in his madne&s;s, which required the mo&s;t &s;trenuous ex|ertions, was taken &s;o ill that he &s;oon after died.</P>
<P><HI>Les Plaideurs,</HI> a comedy in three acts and in ver&s;e, made its appearance in 1668. This is RACINE's only attempt at comedy. A dome&s;tic circum&s;tance is &s;aid to have given ri&s;e to the &s;tory, and the characters, as we are told, are all from real life. This comedy had little &s;ucce&s;s at fir&s;t. MOLIERE, however, did it
<PB N="381" REF="391">
ju&s;tice, and &s;aid, that tho&s;e who railed at that co|medy ought to be railed at them&s;elves. At length the king &s;aw it and &s;poke favourably of it, after which it did tolerably well.</P>
<P><HI>Britannicus</HI> was performed in 1669. This piece in &s;pight of its merit failed on its eighth repre&s;enta|tion. RACINE u&s;hered it into the world with a pre|face in which he very imprudently treated COR|NEILLE with &s;everity; he, however, became &s;en&s;i|ble of his error and afterwards &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P><HI>B&eacute;r&eacute;nice</HI> came out in 1671. The &s;i&s;ter in-law of LOUIS the fourteenth, induced RACINE to write a piece on the parting of TITUS and BERENICE, that circum&s;tance having a re&s;emblance to the &s;eparation of her and her brother. RACINE engaged too ha&s;tily to comply with this reque&s;t, and BOILEAU told him that if he had been on the &s;pot he &s;hould not have given his word. The &s;ubject certainly was not a &s;a|vourable one; and though, perhaps out of de&s;erence to tho&s;e whom it was intended to compliment, it was pretty well followed, yet it was parodied and quoted &s;o ludicrou&s;ly that RACINE, always very irritable, became truly &s;orry he had written it.</P>
<P><HI>Bajazet</HI> was brought forward in 1672. This tra|gedy had good &s;ucce&s;s, but there is &s;carcely an in|&s;tance in all RACINE where character is not &s;acri|ficed to ver&s;ification.</P>
<P><PB N="382" REF="392"><HI>Mithridate</HI> made its appearance in 1673. The <HI>Pulch&eacute;rie</HI> of CORNEILLE, performed the year be|fore, which fell in &s;pight of its author's great name, lifted RACINE into con&s;iderable fame; he brought out <HI>Mithridate</HI> when this great man, who had per|fected every &s;pecies of dramatic entertainment in FRANCE, was ungratefully &s;hunned and neglected. He might have &s;aid with POMPEY,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Do&s;t thou not &s;ee that all eyes are turned towards the ri&s;ing &s;un!"</Q></P>
<P><HI>Iphigene</HI> was performed in 1674. RACINE, and the new ta&s;te he had introduced here gained ground and &s;o completely conquered CORNEILLE and na|ture, that on the following year that great writer re|tired from the theatre. I &s;hall, therefore, now take him up where I left him, and employ the &s;hort re|mainder of this volume to &s;peak of him and his works.</P>
<P><HI>Othon</HI> appeared in 1664. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In which,"</Q> &s;ays FON|TENELLE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"CORNEILLE has fairly placed TACITUS on the French &s;tage."</Q>
The Mar&s;hal de GRAM|MONT &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that in <HI>Othon</HI> CORNEILLE was the the breviary of kings."</Q>
BOILEAU, however, who was at this time attached both to the writings and the per&s;on of RACINE, was not contented with this tra|gedy becau&s;e, perhaps, it had none of that tin&s;el with which he and others at that time corrupted the French ta&s;te.</P>
<P><HI>Age&s;ilas</HI> was performed in 1666. This piece is &s;aid
<PB N="383" REF="393">
by &s;ome not to have been written by CORNEILLE, but FONTENELLE contends that it was, and points out a &s;cene that he &s;ays could not have been written by any body el&s;e. The controver&s;ies about it, how|ever, prove that it came from no other pen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DESPREAUX, the eternal puffer of RACINE, attacked this piece, as it was cu&s;tomary for him to do with every thing written by COR|NEILLE. He wrote this Epigram to decry <HI>Age&s;ilas</HI> and <HI>Attila:</HI>
<Q><LG TYPE="epigram">
<L>APRES L'AGESILAS,</L>
<L>HELAS!</L>
<L>MAIS APRES ATTILA,</L>
<L>HOLA!</L>
</LG></Q>
BOILEAU expected that CORNEILLE would have been greatly morti|fied at this but he turned it to his advantage, and the confu&s;ion of the &s;atiri&s;t, pretending it was meant as a compliment. The literal words mean <Q REND="inline">"after Age&s;ilas, alas! After Attila, no more."</Q> BOILEAU's in|tention is &s;elf evident; but CORNEILLE pretended to believe that it meant, that <HI>Age&s;ilas</HI> had attained every end of tragedy by exciting pity, <HI>Helas</HI> being an interjection of commi&s;eration, and <HI>Attila</HI> was the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of tragedy; and that, therefore, the epigramati&s;t had &s;eemed to hope there would never be another.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Attila</HI> came out in 1667. CORNEILLE piqued at the preference given to RACINE by the company of the <HI>Hotel de Bourgogne,</HI> carried this tragedy to the <HI>Palais Royal,</HI> where MOLIERE received it with great &s;atisfaction. The celebrated THORILLIERE performed Attila, and Madame MOLIERE repre|&s;ented Flavie. It was well received at fir&s;t, but the gout for RACINE and declamation carried every thing before it, and <HI>Attila</HI> was &s;oon neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Tite et Berenice,</HI> repre&s;ented in 1671, yielded
<PB N="384" REF="394">
the victory to RACINE's tragedy under the &s;ame title. They were both written to plea&s;e the vanity of a wo|man, and RACINE, being a perfect courtier and a young man &s;ucceeded be&s;t. It was impo&s;&s;ible any thing but nature could dictate to CORNEILLE; RA|CINE perpetually &s;uffered him&s;elf to be dictated to by the reigning ta&s;te and his friend DESPREAUX.</P>
<P><HI>Pulcherie,</HI> brought out in 1672, gave RACINE an|other triumph. There is, however, a &s;trength of cha|racter in it which RACINE never reached; but the tide of prejudice was now &s;o &s;trong again&s;t COR|NEILLE that he ventured but one more play and then retired.</P>
<P><HI>Sur&eacute;ne</HI> was that play. It was performed in 1674, and has &s;ome &s;trokes of the ma&s;ter which, perhaps, has not been &s;ince equalled; but it failed, and COR|NEILLE determined to retire from the bu&s;y world and make up his mind to die like a man and a chri&s;tian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Be&s;ides his dramatic productions CORNEILLE produced a va|riety of things, both in French and in Latin, all which bear the &s;terling &s;tamp of an extraordinary and commanding genius; a genius, like the tripod of the Sybil, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to approach without feeling a &s;udden enthu&s;ia&s;m.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CORNEILLE was at the height of his glory when he retired in 1653. The advantage taken of his ab|&s;ence to model the theatres to the rules of art, &s;o enervated the drama, that what it gained on the &s;ide
<PB N="385" REF="395">
of ta&s;te and refinement, it lo&s;t on the &s;ide of &s;im|plicity and nature. The grandeur of tragedy in par|ticular &s;unk after MOLIERE had taught them how to admire true comedy, and the &s;oftne&s;s and effiminacy, introduced by RACINE, which, in proportion as it &s;unk to mere &s;tyle and regularity lo&s;t &s;ight of the &s;ublime, enchained the theatre in the &s;hackles of complai&s;ance and &s;ervility; till women, the univer|&s;al rulers of French fa&s;hions, became the arbiters of dramatic excellence, and the courtier bore away the victory from the philo&s;opher, who was now in deri&s;ion called Old CORNEILLE.</P>
<P>He, however, proudly di&s;dained to adopt this new ta&s;te. Not becau&s;e he could not have excelled RA|CINE, nor becau&s;e his age had enfeebled his mind&mdash;both of which ob&s;ervations have been urged again&s;t him&mdash;for in tho&s;e &s;cenes of <HI>P&s;yche,</HI> which he wrote, but did not acknowledge, he has purpo&s;ely aban|doned him&s;elf to an exce&s;s of tenderne&s;s which RA|CINE would have found it difficult to imitate.</P>
<P>CORNEILLE was of a portly &s;tature, he had an agreeable countenance, a large no&s;e, a hand&s;ome mouth, and eyes full of fire; the whole effect lively, and marking, and proper to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;|terity either in a medal or a bu&s;t. He knew, as a perfect ma&s;ter, <HI>Les Belles Lettres,</HI> hi&s;tory, politics, and every other elegant and erudite &s;tudy; but his great and favourite object was the theatre; for any
<PB N="386" REF="396">
thing el&s;e he had neither lei&s;ure, nor curio&s;ity, nor much e&s;teem. He &s;poke, even on &s;ubjects he well under&s;tood, diffidently, and to know the great CORNEILLE he mu&s;t be read.</P>
<P>He was grave, but never &s;our; his humour was plain, but never rude; he was a kind hu&s;band, a fond parent and a faithful friend. His temperament in|clined him to love, but never to liberti&s;m. He had a firm and independent mind, without &s;upplene&s;s, but was little calculated to make a fortune at a French court<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very material to add here; that though CORNEILLE, by the cabals of RICHELIEU, was kept out of the French academy till after that mini&s;ter's death, yet the whole world have allowed him to have been a brilliant ornament of that &s;ociety, and he was at its head when he died. It will be but ju&s;tice hereafter to in&s;ert the elegant eulogium of RACINE on this great man, when his brother, T. CORNEILLE, was admitted into the academy as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</NOTE>, who&s;e manners he de&s;pi&s;ed. He was &s;en&s;ible of prai&s;e, but he dete&s;ted flattery; diffident of his own merit, and forward to encourage the merit of others. To great natural probity, he joined a fervid but not a bigotted love of religion; and, indeed, &s;uch was his public talents, and his private virtues, that it is diffi|cult to &s;ay which was predominent in this truly great and ju&s;tly celebrated character, the man, or the writer.</P>
