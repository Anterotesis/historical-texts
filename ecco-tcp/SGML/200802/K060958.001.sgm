<HEAD>THE VOYAGES, TRAVELS, AND MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM OWEN GWIN VAUGHAN, <HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Day I was born, was the fir&s;t of my Misfortunes; for the Moment that gave me Birth, robb'd my dear Mother of Life, and I came into the World an innocent Murderer, the la&s;t of five Sons.</P>
<P>Tho' my Father had a con&s;iderable E&s;tate, yet, as I was the younge&s;t of all, there was
<PB N="2" REF="8">
but little to expect for me; and ere I arriv'd to my fourth Year, a Mother-in-law was brought into the Family, that had one Son, and two Daughters; but &s;he &s;ecur'd to my Father a con&s;iderable E&s;tate while &s;he liv'd, tho' after her Death it was to devolve on her own Chil|dren; and I am pretty well inform'd, that was the chief Motive of my Father's wi&s;hing her a long Life.</P>
<P>Sure Marriage mu&s;t be an unfortunate State on &s;uch Conditions, e&s;pecially on one Side; for every body agreed my Mother-in-law (from her outward Behaviour) was very fond of my Father; but &s;he laid out her whole Portion of Good-Nature upon him, &s;he ha|ving not one Grain left for any of his Chil|dren, and, between 'em both, good Hou&s;e-keeping was bani&s;h'd, that liv'd with us in my Mother's Days.</P>
<P>My Father, give him his Due, was ra|king enough to provide for <HI>his</HI> Children; and his Wife was not an Ace behind him in ta|king Care for <HI>hers.</HI></P>
<P>My Mother-in-law's Son was much of my own Age, &s;o to School we were &s;ent together, which was the happie&s;t Time of my Life; for my good Mother-in-law being over-fond of her only Son, allow'd him hand&s;omly of
<PB N="3" REF="9">
every thing; and my Father, that there &s;hould be no Difference between us, did the like by me; &s;o we both far'd the better by their Emulation, and whatever Brother <HI>Jack</HI> had one Day, to be &s;ure <HI>Billy</HI> (meaning my|&s;elf) had the next: But, tho' it favours of Vanity to prai&s;e my&s;elf, yet I will declare, I was a better Proficient in Learning than my School-fellow, for I took a great Plea&s;ure in my Studying; but, on the contrary, my Brother was very idle, and I often receiv'd good part of his Money for the Week, to make his Exerci&s;e for him; &s;o by this Me|thod, our Parents imagin'd him a better Scho|lar than he was.</P>
<P>Our Ma&s;ter, tho' a rigid one, was &s;ome|thing deceiv'd in him; for I was very cau|tious of letting any one under&s;tand the Helps I gave him, well knowing, if it was once di&s;cover'd, I &s;hou'd lo&s;e my Perqui&s;ites, as I call'd 'em. But one <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> it all came out.</P>
<P>The Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h being at Din|ner, and, as it prov'd, which does not al|ways happen, a good Scholar, was de&s;ir'd to examine the Yonkers, as they call'd us, my Mother being gone out of the Room ju&s;t be|fore; <HI>Domine</HI> &s;et upon me fir&s;t, paying, as
<PB N="4" REF="10">
he thought, a Compliment to my Father, and I went thro' my Examination &s;o readily, that my Father gave me a Crown-piece to encourage me; but, at the &s;ame time, whi&s;|per'd me to put it up before the good Wo|man, my Mother-in-law, came back a|gain.</P>
<P>When the Par&s;on had fini&s;h'd &s;everal ela|borate Speeches on the Ripene&s;s of my Ge|nius, and what not, adding among the re&s;t, He did not fear in time but he &s;hou'd &s;ee me a great State&s;man; he took my Schoolfellow <HI>John</HI> to Task, who came to Examination like a Thief to his Trial: I &s;tood ju&s;t behind him, and prompted him unheard by the re&s;t of the Company; yet he made &s;o many Blunders, that, like Sir <HI>Martin</HI> and his Man <HI>Warner,</HI> we were both di&s;cover'd; at which I was very much griev'd, for I &s;oon ap|prehended &s;uch Care wou'd be taken of Mr. <HI>Dunce,</HI> that I &s;hou'd finger no more of his Money, and all the Prai&s;es I receiv'd from the Company for the Aptne&s;s of my Parts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cou'd not extingui&s;h the Thoughts on't. But, to mend the matter, my Mo|ther-in-law, who happen'd to come in ju&s;t as he was beginning his Firy Trial, big with Expectation of her Son <HI>Johnny</HI> proving a
<PB N="5" REF="11">
Prodigy of Learning, and finding her&s;elf &s;o much di&s;appointed, cou'd not contain her Temper, but flew out in a manner little plea|&s;ing to the Company. She did not doubt, &s;he &s;aid, but there had been much Pains ta|ken with that Jackanapes (meaning my Wor|&s;hip) but &s;he wou'd take care for the future to choo&s;e a Ma&s;ter that was in her Intere&s;t, to in&s;truct her Child; that it was much a|gain&s;t her Inclination at fir&s;t to let him go where all my Brothers had gone before, be|ing the Teacher was in my Father's Inte|re&s;t, and a thou&s;and &s;uch Speeches, which &s;truck my Father into Amazement; and tho' the Par&s;on with a great deal of Rea&s;on (that perhaps you'll &s;ay is a Wonder) us'd many fine Speeches to qualify this Matter, yet they all prov'd like Words utter'd in a De&s;art; but when Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> in Tears, told her my Father had given me a Crown, &s;he grew outragious, and with a great deal of Dexterity gave me a hand&s;ome Box on the Ear, le&s;s gentle, I believe, than the Boor gives the Duke of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Carinthia</HI> is a Province of <HI>Germany,</HI> upon the Bor|ders of <HI>Italy:</HI> Whenever the Ducal Coronet is vacant, the Per&s;on who is to be in&s;tall'd, is &s;eated in a Chair of great Antiquity, made like two great Chairs put Back to Back, with two Seats; in one the intended Duke &s;its, in the other a Boor of the Country, who is to offer two Oxen to the Duke, one the leane&s;t, the other the fatte&s;t that can be got; but the Duke is to return the fat one to the Boor, which is to intimate he is to improve his Country or Dukedom (for &s;ometimes it is the Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI> who is cho&s;e Duke of <HI>Ca|rinthia</HI>) from the Poverty of the lean Ox, to that of the fat One. When that Part of the Ceremony is over, the Boor, or Countryman, ri&s;es up, comes to the Duke, who is fitting with his Face to the Ea&s;t, and gives him a gentle Box on the Ear; after that, he puts on his Feet a Pair of Shoes fill'd with the Earth of the Country, and that concludes the In&s;tallment; tho' the la&s;t Part of the Ceremony they omit when a Proxy is in&s;tall'd, which of|ten happens when the Title is conferr'd on the Emperor, or &s;ome other Potentate.</NOTE> <HI>Carinthia</HI> at his In&s;talla|tion.
<PB N="6" REF="12">
My Father, to be even with her, re|turn'd my Brother <HI>John</HI> one as like it as a couple of Billiard-Balls. My good Mother-in-law perceiving it, was re&s;olv'd to be even with him, and gave it me hand&s;omly on both &s;ides my Ears, which was return'd &s;martly back upon the Chops of my Schoolfellow by my Father, till we got hand&s;omly cuff'd be|tween 'em.</P>
<P>My Father &s;eeing his Wife's Rage rather increas'd, than dimini&s;h'd, laid hold of both her Hands; &s;he &s;truggling to get loo&s;e, and
<PB N="7" REF="13">
finding it impo&s;&s;ible, &s;pit in my Father's Face, who was &s;o much confounded, that he let her go, and &s;he waddled out of the Room like a Goo&s;e upon a Common.</P>
<P>When &s;he was gone, my Father &s;at him down in his Chair without &s;peaking for &s;ome time; but at la&s;t broke out with an exalted Voice, This is the fir&s;t time I ever wi&s;h'd my&s;elf unmarry'd, and I am very much in fear it will not be the la&s;t; for when once Man and Wife have broke thro' the Re&s;pect they owe each other, continual Jarrs will &s;uc|ceed, and the fir&s;t Quarrel will &s;oon be fol|low'd by many others. I have no Notion (continu'd he) after this Breach, we can ever be properly reconcil'd.</P>
<P>The good Par&s;on &s;aid many things in or|der to excu&s;e both Parties, but my Father gave him no manner of An&s;wer. He &s;eeing things in &s;o much Confu&s;ion, took his Leave.</P>
<P>When he was gone, my Father began to examine me about my Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> and the Rea&s;on why my Ma&s;ter did not acquaint him with his Indocibility; I well knowing he ab|horr'd a Lye, declar'd to him the whole Truth; but begg'd his Pardon, telling him, my young Apprehen&s;ion cou'd not conceive &s;uch Confu&s;ion wou'd follow.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14">Well, return'd my Father, I have Rea&s;on to believe you will never be guilty of &s;uch Inadvertencies again, therefore I freely par|don you; but for the future you mu&s;t go to School by your&s;elf, at lea&s;t, 'till this Matter is blown over, and my Wife and I are tho|roughly reconcil'd, if there is a Po&s;&s;ibility of it. Upon &s;aying this, he wav'd his Hand, that I might leave him to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I got into the Courtyard be|fore the Hou&s;e, my Brother <HI>Jack</HI> met me. Ah! &s;aid he, my Mother has given me a Crown, as well as my Father did you. I am glad on't, return'd I. I believe that's a Lye, &s;aid my Mother, who was coming out of the Garden, and had &s;taid to li&s;ten, as I &s;uppo&s;e. Madam, I have learnt, &s;aid I, to &s;peak Truth, whatever may be the Con&s;e|quence, and in mo&s;t of the Books we are to learn, we are inform'd our Tongue and Heart &s;hou'd always go together. Ha! &s;aid &s;he, What, I &s;uppo&s;e you are &s;etting up for a young Philo&s;opher! But I believe you have got a few Sentences by rote, as Parrots have, that you &s;putter out un&s;ea&s;onably. I told her, whatever I had learnt, I wou'd take care never to &s;ay any thing to offend her. No, &s;aid &s;he, you will always be an Offence to
<PB N="9" REF="15">
me, &s;ilent, or &s;peaking. I told her I was ve|ry &s;orry for't, and went back again, with the Tears running down my Cheeks, intending to go up into the Room where I lay, but was met by my Father, who &s;eeing the Tears trickling down my Face, ask'd me ha&s;tily the Rea&s;on of my Grief? I told him, No|thing.</P>
<P>Come, &s;aid he, you know I will have the Truth, therefore tell me without Delay. I then, finding he wou'd be &s;atisfy'd, told all that had pa&s;s'd between my Mother and me, tho' in as tender Terms as I cou'd. When my Father had heard me out, he &s;eem'd very much concern'd, and making a long Pau&s;e, at la&s;t cry'd, Well, I will have a Remedy! And to-morrow, continu'd he, you &s;hall go to your Uncle's, who de&s;ires to &s;ee you, where you &s;hall remain till the Time of your Breaking-up is over.</P>
<P>The next Morning I had Orders to prepare for my Journey. When I was ready to get on Hor&s;eback, I waited on my Father, who bid me go to my Mother and take my Leave of her. I went, but I mu&s;t confe&s;s very un|willingly. When I came to her Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, I kneel'd down as u&s;ual, upon which &s;he &s;aid ha&s;tily, <HI>Ble&s;s you! Ble&s;s you!</HI> which I
<PB N="10" REF="16">
under&s;tood, by her Manner of &s;peaking, was <HI>Dammee! Dammee!</HI></P>
<P>I am come, Madam, &s;aid I, to take my Leave of you, by my Father's Command. Why, pray Sir, return'd my Mother, very &s;cornfully, Where are you going? To my Uncle's, Madam, &s;aid I. Go then, &s;aid &s;he, and a good Riddance. I made my Honours, and down Stairs I went again to my Father.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Will,</HI> &s;aid he, what &s;aid your Mo|ther to you? Did &s;he give you any thing? No Sir, &s;aid I, &s;he only gave me Leave to go about my Bu&s;ine&s;s. Well, &s;aid my Fa|ther, you &s;hall never trouble her again, in the Mind I am in. Go, &s;aid he, get on Hor&s;eback, I'll ride before, and conduct you &s;ome part of the Way.</P>
<P>When I went into the Stable, I heard my Brother <HI>Jack</HI> tell the Groom I mu&s;t not have the Little Hor&s;e, for it was his, and he was to go abroad with his Mother: Brother, &s;aid I, I mu&s;t have him, for my Father's gone be|fore, and will wait for me. No matter for that, &s;aid he, you &s;han't have him. Many Words pa&s;s'd between us, and all the while he was endeavouring to get the Bridle out of my Hand, but finding he was not &s;trong enough, he let go. Ju&s;t as I had got one
<PB N="11" REF="17">
Foot in the Stirrup, with a Prong that he had got out of the Stable, he ran me into the Thigh with one of the Points, the other piercing the Hor&s;e in the Flank, who, feel|ing him&s;elf hurt, gave a Spring, and before I cou'd get upon his Back, he dragg'd me with one Foot in the Stirrup out into the Road, and wou'd have certainly beat me to pieces, if my Father coming back, wonder|ing at my Delay, had not &s;top'd him. The Servant told him I was certainly wounded, for there were Streams of Blood upon the Ground: Examining my Hurt, they found my Boot was full of Blood. I was carry'd in again; tho' with Lo&s;s of Blood, the Vio|lence of the Fall, together with the Drag|ging of the Hor&s;e, I was deprived of my Sen&s;es for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>A Surgeon was immediately &s;ent for; yet my Father was not pre&s;ently inform'd how I came by the Hurt: But when he knew the Truth of it, he was &s;o very much pro|vok'd, that ju&s;t that In&s;tant meeting with my Brother <HI>Jack</HI> coming up Stairs, he kick'd him down again, and in the Fall he broke his Arm. I mention the&s;e little Circum|&s;tances, only as they were the Occa&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">-right Breach in the Family.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="18">When the Surgeon came, he inform'd us there was no Danger but Lo&s;s of Blood; and, with a great many hard Words, told 'em what a narrow E&s;cape I had, for if it had been an Inch higher, and touch'd &s;uch and &s;uch a Thing, all the World cou'd not have &s;av'd my Life to be &s;ure.</P>
<P>When he had made an end of dre&s;&s;ing my Wound, he went to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of my Brother. The Servants had taken him up, and brought him into the &s;ame Room where I was, for our Beds were together. I mu&s;t own the Sight of him, in&s;tead of moving my Pity, &s;tirr'd my Indignation, and I was inwardly &s;atisfy'd with my Father's ju&s;t Re|venge. But while they were &s;etting his Arm, my Mother came among us (alarm'd it &s;eems with his Cries) like one of the Furies, with her Hair about her Ears, out of her Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, not having been acquainted with the Matter thro' the Confu&s;ion of the Family. She ca&s;t many furious Eyes towards me, and I believe, if &s;he had not been pre|vented by my Father, had made me feel the Effects of her Indignation. Madam, &s;aid he, I am &s;orry for the Accident that has hap|pen'd to your Son, not but he de&s;erves it for his young wicked Intention, tho' I don't
<PB N="13" REF="19">
doubt but he was in&s;tigated by his Mother: By me, thou barbarous Wretch! &s;aid &s;he. &mdash; You are &s;orry for the Accident! What Acci|dent? Did not you do it for the Purpo&s;e? with an Intention to break his Neck I &s;up|po&s;e: But I'll be reveng'd on your young Darling, with all his Learning! Upon &s;ay|ing that &s;he ru&s;h'd upon me in &s;pite of 'em, and &s;eiz'd violently upon me, endeavouring to tear me out of the Bed, notwith&s;tanding my weak Condition. But my Father laid hold of her, and with a Pull, &s;wung her to the far|ther end of the Room. Now, Madam, &s;aid he, &s;ince I &s;ee the Inveteracy of your Malice, and having broke the Bonds of Duty, Love, and Tenderne&s;s, I'll make you feel the Power of a Husband; you &s;hall be clo&s;e confin'd to your Apartment, never once to conver&s;e with Me, or Mine. You &s;hall want nothing, but your Liberty, where you will have Time enough to reflect upon your Conduct, and what it is to injure a Husband by your violent Proceedings. So &s;aying, he &s;eiz'd upon her, maugre her Strugglings, carry'd her to the Nur&s;ery, and lock'd her in: The Rea&s;on of his putting her there, was, as he &s;aid after|wards, to prevent her making any Attempts to get out of the Windows, being there were
<PB N="14" REF="20">
Bars fix'd for fear of any Accident among us, when we were under the Nur&s;e's Care.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding her Violence of Temper, &s;he had certainly (at lea&s;t in every Body's Opinion) a tender Regard for my Father; and if he did not return it, he gave her no Cau&s;e to complain. He had too much Hu|manity to u&s;e any one ill, much le&s;s a Wife. I have often heard him &s;ay, While my Wife continues her Good-humour to me, &s;he &s;hall never find me in the lea&s;t to blame in my Conduct to her; but whenever that alters, I &s;hall have &s;o much Regard to my&s;elf, to be ea&s;y.</P>
<P>During my Illne&s;s, my Father was hardly ever from me. I did not think it was pro|per for one of my Years to ask him any Que&s;tions concerning his Matrimonial War|fare; but as he was &s;itting upon my Bed, a|bout the fifth Day of my Illne&s;s, my Mo|ther's Maid brought him a Letter, which my Father perus'd, then read it to me, as fol|lows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> AM &s;en&s;ible the Serenity of Temper you. have often promis'd to your&s;elf, if any Breach &s;hould happen between us, gives you very great
<PB N="15" REF="21">
Satisfaction, whatever Unea&s;ine&s;s I feel: But, as I have Cau&s;e to believe the Burden will be weightier, if you will not allow me one Favour, which I am almo&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd you will comply with, that is, to have the Company of my hurt Son in my Confinement, be&s;ides Maternal Affec|tions, I believe there is another Motive which convinces me I &s;hall not be deny'd, you will get rid of an Object which cannot but be un|grateful to you, becau&s;e it belongs to One who formerly thought it her chiefe&s;t Happine&s;s to be call'd</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>Confinement, I find, &s;aid my Father, is a good Mortifier; but I &s;hall very willingly comply with her Reque&s;t, upon your Ac|count, for I can't &s;uppo&s;e it is very plea&s;ing to you, to have always before your Eyes the Cau&s;e of your Pain and Illne&s;s. Sir, &s;aid I, there is no Motive more prevalent with me, than the Satisfaction of my Mother; be|&s;ides, I hope I have it not in my Nature to bear Malice, therefore I have long &s;ince for|given my Brother, imagining it to be only the Heat of Pa&s;&s;ion, and Want of Years. My Child, &s;aid my Father, your Years are the
<PB N="16" REF="22">
&s;ame, both in your Thirteenth; and yet I am convinc'd he has not the Con&s;ideration that thou ha&s;t, which I am pleas'd with, not for his Want of Under&s;tanding, but that thine &s;eems to exceed thy Years: Pray Heaven continue it! Sir, &s;aid I, 'tis all I ask, the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven and You; in having them, I &s;hall want nothing; but, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with all the Gifts of Fortune, wanting them, I &s;hall be poor indeed! My Boy (&s;aid my Father, and ki&s;s'd me) once more Heaven ble&s;s thee! Grant that I may be able to provide for thee according to my Inclination!</P>
<P>By this time the Maid, who had retir'd while my Father was peru&s;ing the Letter, came in to expect an An&s;wer. Tell your Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;aid my Father, I &s;hall comply with her Reque&s;t, as I &s;hall to all others that are rea&s;onable. Upon this An&s;wer, the Maid went out, and my Father gave immediate Orders to remove the Boy: Then, with a gentle Pre&s;s by the Hand, took his Leave of me. I mu&s;t own I was very much de|lighted at his Expre&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s to me, being it was what I never receiv'd from him before: 'Tis true, he never us'd me har&s;hly, but he did not &s;eem to me to have the lea&s;t Regard, or playing and toying with Children,

as I have known Parents do; his Manner of Behaviour to me before, begot Re&s;pect in me; it was enough if he did but look at me, to make me ob&s;erve him; tho' I can't fan|&s;y it is a proper Carriage from a Parent to a Child, neither the way to beget Obedience; there is a kind of Indulgence to the harmle&s;s Follies of Children, that in&s;en&s;ibly wins the Affections of the Child. I remember my own Brother, that was one Year elder than me, never car'd to come in my Father's Sight, which proceeded from his &s;tiff Beha|viour to us. But I am not laying down Rules or Examples between Parents and Children, tho' really I think &s;ome Parents want as much In&s;truction that way as their Children. Tho' I am well-a&s;&s;ur'd my Father had a tender Regard for his, notwith&s;tanding his rigid Behaviour, for he puni&s;h'd &s;evere|ly for Faults openly, and, as I found after|wards, rewarded 'em &s;ecretly when they did well: But my Readers may with Rea&s;on &s;ay, this is but little to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the next Vi&s;it my Father made me, he told me he fan&s;y'd my Mother had a great mind to be making her Peace; but, added he, <HI>Will,</HI> I'll take care, if it comes to that, you &s;hall be included in the Treaty. I told
<PB N="18" REF="24">
him I &s;hould be pleas'd, let it go which way it wou'd, if he wou'd be &s;o. I have receiv'd another Letter &s;ince Morning, &s;aid he, with her De&s;ire to &s;peak with me; in the Evening I &s;hall comply with her Reque&s;t; and the Re|&s;ult of our Conference thou &s;halt know to|morrow Morning; for, added he, it will be late before I can go to her, for I expect your Schoolma&s;ter this Evening, who is to &s;tay all Night on purpo&s;e to &s;ee you, as he &s;ends me Word. And, accordingly, before Night, the good old Man came to condole with me, and in &s;ome &s;ort to chide me, in neglecting to tell him of my Brother's Want of Learning: However, &s;aid he, I forgive you, and have prevail'd on your Father that I may have you again; for I &s;hould be much concern'd to lo&s;e the Flower of my Flock; as he was pleas'd to call me: As for your Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> added he, I have advis'd with your Father, to prevail on your Mother to put him out to &s;ome creditable Trade, and not longer to lo&s;e his Time in fruitle&s;s Endeavours to learn what he can never attain to; for, continu'd he, I have ju&s;t now been examining him in the Gar|den (for as he had the U&s;e of his Legs, he cou'd go any where) but I am in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion to find him &s;uch a Dunce, and
<PB N="19" REF="25">
that I cou'd be &s;o long impos'd on between you.</P>
<P>I begg'd my Ma&s;ter to mention my Folly no more, for I a&s;&s;ur'd him it was Want of Thought, and Tenderne&s;s to him, that oc|ca&s;ion'd the Deceit; I had &s;ufficiently repent|ed of it, and if it was to come over again, wou'd &s;ooner die than be guilty of any &s;uch Proceedings. I added, It was the great|e&s;t Grief I ever did, or ever &s;hou'd feel, that from &s;o trivial a thing, as I thought, &s;uch Difference &s;hou'd be created between my Fa|ther and Mother. Re&s;t contented, reply'd my Ma&s;ter: Thy Mother-in-law has prov'd what I always thought her, a turbulent-&s;pi|rited Woman, only &s;he had Art enough to hide it &s;o long from your Father. Indeed her fir&s;t Husband, Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> many Years ago hinted &s;ome &s;uch thing to me. I am pleas'd &s;he has declar'd her&s;elf upon &s;o &s;light an Oc|ca&s;ion, that your good Father may be arm'd in time again&s;t her Contrivances; for I am apt to believe, even her Affection to him is only counterfeited, and once Women can counterfeit Love, I give 'em lo&s;t to all vir|tuous Principles; their Endearments are the wor&s;t of Crimes, and the greate&s;t Affront they can put upon a Man. I have known
<PB N="20" REF="26">
&s;ome Women who have prov'd fal&s;e to their Husband's Bed, yet have carry'd it with &s;uch a Tenderne&s;s and Regard to them, that if the World had not been convinc'd of their Ba&s;e|ne&s;s, 'twere enough to call Truth a Lyar.</P>
<P>I interrupted my Ma&s;ter, by telling him I thought there was no Grounds even for Su&s;picion of any &s;uch thing concerning my Mother. I hope &s;o too, reply'd my School-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>After &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;e of the Weak|ne&s;&s;es of Women, he left me to my own Thoughts, but I mu&s;t own they were not very plea&s;ing ones. I began to con&s;ider my Con|dition. If my Mother prov'd an ill Woman, as I had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect from the Hints and Di&s;cour&s;es of my Ma&s;ter, I &s;hou'd cer|tainly &s;uffer in the end; for if my Father was reconcil'd to her, through her Cunning, I did not doubt but &s;he would improve it, and make me the Butt of her Re&s;entment; and, notwith&s;tanding my Father's good Sen&s;e, and Knowledge of the World, there was not an Impo&s;&s;ibility but he might fall into the Snares of a &s;ubtle de&s;igning Woman: The Thought of this &s;pread a melancholy Cloud over my Face, which was perceiv'd by my Father, who enter'd in the mid&s;t of my Cogitations.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="27">How now, <HI>Will,</HI> &s;aid he, does thy Wound pain thee, that thou look'&s;t with &s;uch a &s;or|rowful Countenance? No, Sir, &s;aid I, I was only enter'd into thinking of what may hap|pen for the future, and the Fear of lo&s;ing your Kindne&s;s, made me &s;ad. Well, &s;aid he, as I am a&s;&s;ur'd from your Behaviour, that will never happen, I hope your Concern will cea&s;e. I told you (continu'd my Father) when I parted with you la&s;t, that I wou'd not let thee know the Re&s;ult of the Interview till the Morning; but as we are reconcil'd, I cou'd not &s;o long delay thee thy Part of the Satisfaction. To-morrow in the Morning thy Mother, thy Ma&s;ter, and all of us, are to come into thy Room to Breakfa&s;t, where I hope all Animo&s;ities will cea&s;e. On my Side, Sir, &s;aid I, they were never begun, nor ever &s;hall, without my Temper and Inclination &s;hou'd be inverted. I believe there's no Dan|ger of that, reply'd my Father; and &s;o, my good Boy, Good-night.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my Father was gone, my Ma|&s;ter came in again: <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid he, I cou'd not go to Bed without &s;eeing you, to de&s;ire, &s;ince your Father and Mother are reconcil'd, to take no manner of Notice of the Di&s;cour&s;e you and I had together concerning her. If

told him, without any Caution, it &s;hou'd have been as &s;ecret as if no one had known it but him&s;elf; I believe it, &s;aid he, yet I thought Caution might have been nece&s;&s;ary; and &s;o bid me Good-night.</P>
<P>When I was once more left alone, Re|flexion began to be &s;tronger than before, and weighing, according to my young Judgment, the Affairs and Condition of the Family, thought verily my Circum&s;tances wou'd &s;uffer by it. I was in the mid&s;t of a thou&s;and con|fus'd ungrateful Thoughts, when the Sur|geon came in to dre&s;s me, and viewing my Wound, was very much &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee it look &s;o angry: I am afraid, young Gentle|man, &s;aid he, you have met with &s;omething to-day that makes you unea&s;y, or have ta&s;ted &s;omething that you &s;hou'd not have done, which occa&s;ions this Alteration in your Hurt. Pray, &s;aid he, what have you had to eat to|day? When I inform'd him, That, &s;aid he, cou'd never hurt you; the Alteration I perceive mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome Di&s;turbance of Mind, and I value my Patient &s;o much, that I mu&s;t know the Cau&s;e, that I may &s;peak to your Father to have it remedy'd. I found him &s;o pre&s;&s;ing, that I was oblig'd to tell him Some little Accidents in the Family had given
<PB N="23" REF="29">
me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, which were now recon|cil'd, and wou'd &s;oon be forgot. Yes, &s;aid he, I hear your Father and Mother are come to an Agreement, and I can't &s;ay I am over well pleas'd at it, for if &s;he does not play him, and all of you, &s;ome Trick, I'll be hang'd; I have Rea&s;ons be&s;t known to my&s;elf for what I &s;ay.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, &s;aid I, you have any &s;ecret Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect my Mother's future Con|duct; and without you di&s;clo&s;e 'em to me, I &s;hall imagine they are Chimaeras of your own Brain, that flow from your too much Drinking (for he was fam'd for a great To|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">er) or otherwi&s;e from her refu&s;ing you the Cure of my Brother <HI>Jack</HI>; for when my Mother-in-law heard he was my Surgeon, her Re&s;entment run &s;o high, that &s;he wou'd not employ him.</P>
<P>Nothing of all this, I can a&s;&s;ure you, re|turn'd the Surgeon; but I &s;hall &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent, 'till I have ob&s;erv'd her future Be|haviour, and if &s;he de&s;erves it, I &s;hall di&s;|clo&s;e &s;ome things that will be very &s;urprizing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o all of you. I wi&s;h, &s;aid I, you wou'd ei|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">her have mention'd nothing of it now, or wou'd re&s;olve to tell me what it is you know, or I fear, if you leave me in doubt, it will not at all help me in the Cure.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="30">I am &s;orry, return'd the Surgeon, I have inadvertently &s;aid any thing to make you un|ea&s;y; but, to reconcile you to your Re&s;t to|night, be a&s;&s;ur'd, whenever I di&s;clo&s;e it, 'twill help you rather than injure you; and tho' I have many Follies, I have Di&s;cretion enough to keep this a Secret, till it &s;hall prove advantageous to your Father and you.</P>
<P>I us'd many Arguments to per&s;uade him to let me know this great Secret, but all to no purpo&s;e; &s;o after he had dre&s;s'd me, he left me with more Cau&s;e of Unea&s;ine&s;s than I had before, which I too plainly &s;hew'd by my Countenance. The Maid who attended me in my Illne&s;s, who was one that liv'd with my Mother in her Life-time, and had the bringing of me up, told me I &s;hould not be unea&s;y at what the Surgeon &s;aid, he was nothing but a meer Rattle, for it was his u&s;ual way to make People imagine he knew &s;omething concerning their Affairs, and when he came to be &s;trictly examin'd, de|ny'd it all, or made an Excu&s;e that he &s;up|pos'd he was drunk when he &s;aid &s;o.</P>
<P>What the Maid &s;aid &s;eem'd probable e|nough; yet I cou'd not put it out of my Head, that notwith&s;tanding his Character, there was &s;omething in his Knowledge concerning our Family.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="31">The Thought of this, with other Affairs, kept me from &s;leeping many Hours, and when I did, it was broken, and interrupted with frightful Dreams. In one, I thought my Mother invited my Father and me to walk with her in a Garden, at the End there was a prodigious high Mountain, which we a&s;|cended with much Difficulty, and when we had gain'd the Summit, my Mother gave my Father a Pu&s;h down the Brow of the Mountain, on the other Side, where my trou|bled Fancy gave him for lo&s;t. She then flew towards me, and violently thru&s;t me down the &s;ame way we came up; I thought I fell to the Bottom much bruis'd, as al&s;o &s;cratch'd by Brambles and Stones that lay in my way, that the Pain I felt awak'd me. I told my Dream to the Maid that &s;at up with me; &s;he reply'd, it was nothing but a di&s;turb'd Fancy with the Pain of my Hurt, and begg'd I wou'd compo&s;e my&s;elf to Sleep, which after &s;ome time I did.</P>
<P>I rea&s;&s;um'd my Dream where I left off. My &s;leeping Imagination repre&s;ented my Mother on the Brow of the Hill, hurling Stones and Clods of Earth at me, yet I thought none of 'em came near me to do me any Damage; and as &s;he was endeavouring
<PB N="26" REF="32">
to come down the Hill, in order, as I thought, to hurt me, &s;he vani&s;h'd away, but I cou'd not perceive which way &s;he went. Upon the In&s;tant I awoke, in a very great Agony, when I told the Maid the Cau&s;e of my Unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;he laugh'd at me, and &s;aid 'twas only form'd from my unea&s;y Thoughts. Whatever &s;he cou'd &s;ay to me upon the Inva|lidity of Dreams, I cou'd not put this out of my Head, nor go to &s;leep again; and the re&s;t of our Di&s;cour&s;e till Morning was Sto|ries of Dreams proving true, which I had oft heard repeated, but &s;he call'd tho&s;e things <HI>Vi&s;ions</HI>; I would have per&s;uaded her mine was &s;uch, but &s;he laugh'd me out of it, or at lea&s;t I had Di&s;cretion enough to &s;ay no more to her concerning it, whatever were my Thoughts about it.</P>
<P>When the Time of Breakfa&s;t came, my Father enter'd the Room, and ask'd me how I had re&s;ted la&s;t Night; the Maid an|&s;wer'd for me, that I had been di&s;turb'd by frightful Dreams; my Father return'd, he had none of the be&s;t; but, continu'd he, Dreams were the only Work of a di&s;turb'd Fancy, and were as far from Truth, as the Glow-Worm's dim Shine from Light and Heat; the Creatures of the drow&s;y Brain.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="33">But, Sir, &s;aid I, many have been fore|warn'd by Dreams of Accidents that have happen'd to 'em; witne&s;s <HI>Calphurnia</HI>'s Dream of the <HI>Butchery</HI> of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Cea&s;ar</HI>'s Dream before he overcame <HI>Pompey,</HI> or that men|tion'd by <HI>Valerius Maximus</HI> of the two <HI>Ar|cadians</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Valerius Maximus,</HI> in his Account of <HI>Dreams,</HI> gives this particular one. Two <HI>Arcadians,</HI> Friends to each other, travelling together, came to the City of <HI>Megara</HI> in the Province of <HI>Achaia,</HI> formerly a Dependant on the <HI>Athenians.</HI> One of 'em went to lodge at a Friend's Hou&s;e, the other at a Public Inn. The Per&s;on that lay at his Friend's, in his Sleep, fan&s;y'd he heard his Com|panion call out for Help from the Violence of his Land|lord; which awak'd him, and &s;tamp'd &s;uch an Impre&s;|&s;ion on his Mind, that he ro&s;e and endeavour'd to find out the Inn. But Fortune not allowing him that Hap|pine&s;s, he went to his Lodging, and addre&s;s'd him&s;elf to Sleep again, laughing to him&s;elf, that a Dream &s;hou'd &s;o much di&s;turb him. When Sleep had once more taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Faculties, he dreamt that his Friend came to his Bed&s;ide cover'd with Wounds, who told him, That &s;ince Fate had not permitted him to prevent his End, he hop'd he wou'd &s;ee his Death reveng'd. My Bo|dy, &s;aid the Apparition, is now carrying in a Cart, co|ver'd with Rubbi&s;h, out of the Gate of the City, by the Inn-keeper, who murder'd me for my Money. Ari&s;e! and bring him to the Puni&s;hment he de&s;erves. The friendly <HI>Arcadian,</HI> at this Second Warning, aro&s;e, and taking A&s;&s;i&s;tance with him, &s;topp'd the Inn-keeper with the Cart, where he found the bleeding Body of his Friend. The Man confe&s;s'd his Guilt, and was execu|ted accordingly.</NOTE>. Nothing, Child, reply'd my Fa|ther,
<PB N="28" REF="34">
but the Fancy of Poets and Hi&s;torians, and I hope you have Under&s;tanding enough to &s;light 'em; 'tis nothing but &s;uper&s;titious Opinion that gives any Credit to Dreams and Omens; but, continu'd he, I wou'd have thee put on a more plea&s;ing Countenance, for thy Mother, Brother, and I, are coming pre|&s;ently to Breakfa&s;t with thee, in order for a Reconciliation on all Hands, and if &s;he per|ceives that Cloud upon thy Face, &s;he will be apt to conjecture her Pre&s;ence is irk&s;ome to thee. I reply'd, I would do my Endeavour to be compos'd, as indeed I had Rea&s;on; but I told him, I wou'd ever have my Face the <HI>Index</HI> of my Heart, for I &s;hou'd find it a ve|ry hard Task to counterfeit any Pa&s;&s;ion. Well, &s;aid my Father, &s;miling, we &s;hall be with you pre&s;ently, and went out.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I re&s;olv'd to ri&s;e, and put on my Gown, in order to receive &s;uch a Vi&s;it decently, tho' the Maid wou'd have di&s;|&s;uaded me. I was but ju&s;t dre&s;s'd, and &s;et down in mv Chair (for I was not able to &s;tand) when my Father, Mother, and her Son, en|ter'd
<PB N="29" REF="35">
the Chamber. As &s;oon as my Mother came in, &s;he &s;aid to my Father, he had in|form'd her I had kept my Bed: Indeed, my Dear, return'd my Father, I am &s;omething &s;urpriz'd, for I left him in Bed not a Quar|ter of an Hour ago. I an&s;wer'd, that I thought it my Duty to come as near my Knees as I cou'd, and I hop'd my Mother wou'd pardon the Po&s;ture I was in; but I threw an humble Heart at her Feet, and hop'd &s;he wou'd give me her Ble&s;&s;ing with her Pardon. Heaven ble&s;s thee (&s;aid &s;he) my Dear; and for Pardon, 'tis I ought to ask that of thee, who have really offended; but acknowledg|ing a Fault is the Way to Repentance, and all my Hope is we &s;hall bury in Oblivion pa&s;t Tran&s;actions. She then brought my Brother forward, who told me with a cloudy Countenance, He begg'd my Pardon, and wou'd do &s;o no more. I told him I had long &s;ince learnt to forget every thing, for For|givene&s;s was not a Word became a Child's Mouth. We all ki&s;s'd round.</P>
<P>When our mutual Care&s;&s;es were over, I cou'd perceive Tears of Joy &s;tand in my Fa|ther's Eyes for this our Reconciliation, and I imagin'd my Mother's Countenance look'd with a plea&s;ing Contentment in't. But alas!
<PB N="30" REF="36">
'tis hard to know the Heart of Woman! A fair Face, with a &s;miling Countenance, often harbour Rancour in the Soul; and as they &s;tudy to &s;et off their Features, they al&s;o &s;tu|dy to make their Face a Mask to their Mind.</P>
<P>They &s;taid with me &s;ome time, nor per|haps had gone &s;o &s;oon, if Word had not been brought in, that the Surgeon was come to dre&s;s me. My Mother begg'd Leave to retire, telling me &s;he had not Courage e|nough to &s;upport the Sight of my Hurt; &s;o my Father led her out, and my Brother fol|low'd 'em.</P>
<P>Immediately after the Surgeon came in, Well, &s;aid he, I find all's right again; I met your Father leading your Mother through the Hall, as if he had ju&s;t begun to court her. I wi&s;h it may hold on her Side. I hope there is no Fear of it, &s;aid I, but I can a&s;&s;ure you, what you hinted to me Ye&s;terday, has given me a great deal of Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Think on't no more, return'd the Surgeon, think on't no more, Ma&s;ter; I am very &s;or|ry I mention'd any thing to you, and beg you wou'd &s;peak of it no more. How, &s;aid I! do you endeavour to calumniate Per&s;ons out of a Whim of your Brain, and not ex|pect
<PB N="31" REF="37">
to be call'd to an Account for it? I have been inform'd of your Temper, or rather the Villainy of your opprobrious Tongue, and can farther a&s;&s;ure you, that the chimeri|cal A&s;per&s;ions you wou'd endeavour to fix upon my Mother-in-law, &s;hall not go unpu|ni&s;h'd, if my Father retains his u&s;ual Spirit, unle&s;s you this Moment tell the Truth, and either make out what you wou'd in&s;inuate, or clear her by asking Pardon for the Injury you wou'd have done her.</P>
<P>The Surgeon &s;eem'd very much in Confu|&s;ion during my Speech to him, which I ob|&s;erving, did not doubt but it was, as the Maid &s;aid, his con&s;tant Cu&s;tom to calumniate every Body.</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;aid I, by the Confu&s;ion in your Countenance, you &s;eem'd to confe&s;s your Er|ror; I'll give you my Word to mention what has pa&s;t between you and I to no one, on condition, for the future, you'll leave off that vile Cu&s;tom of a&s;per&s;ing the Characters of every Body you know; for it may prove of dangerous Con&s;equence to other People, as well as your&s;elf, and it's a Crime neither be|coming a Chri&s;tian, or a Man.</P>
<P>Sir, return'd the Surgeon, I mu&s;t own to you, you have open'd my Eyes more by your
<PB N="32" REF="38">
Di&s;cour&s;e, than all that I have ever had &s;aid to me upon the like Occa&s;ion, and the vile Trick has crept upon me through Cu&s;tom, for come where you will, even all Sexes, Ages, and Degrees, are fond of hearing a little Scandal, and willing to know the Frail|ties of their Neighbours, not con&s;idering, the Para&s;ite, to the next Company, makes as free with the la&s;t he came from; and I mu&s;t own the Succe&s;s I have met with, or indeed the Willingne&s;s of my Hearers, have often put me upon inventing Stories to plea&s;e my Pa|tients and their Families. But I now repent, and am re&s;olv'd never to be guilty of the like again, and my Repentance is owing to your Advice. After this he ran on with many Encomiums of the Ripene&s;s of my Under|&s;tanding, and a long Rigmerole of nothing to the Purpo&s;e: But, &s;aid he, concerning your Mother, I know &s;omething that I am &s;ure wou'd cau&s;e great Unea&s;ine&s;s in the Fa|mily; yet I beg you wou'd not in&s;i&s;t upon knowing any thing farther, for the Character I perceive I have got in the World, wou'd fly in my Face, and &s;poil my Evidence, till I can plainly prove what I &s;ay, which if I ever &s;ee there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for it, I can in a few Days bring to pa&s;s. I &s;trove many ways

to get &s;omething out of him, but it prov'd to no purpo&s;e, yet I verily believ'd he knew &s;omewhat again&s;t the Reputation of my Mo|ther-in-law.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I began to lo&s;e my+&s;elf in confus'd Thoughts and Notions, as I had formerly done, which gave me vail Un|ea&s;ine&s;s, that led me to imagine my Mother's Conduct to my Father and me all an Arti|fice; this put me upon a Re&s;olution of ob|&s;erving nicely her Carriage, that I might be able to form my Behaviour afterwards.</P>
<P>We liv'd very lovingly together a whole Year, and I began to bury all my Fears, imagining &s;till the Surgeon had wrongfully a&s;pers'd my Mother: Therefore I apply'd my&s;elf hard to my Studies with my Tutor, for &s;ince the fir&s;t Falling out, my Father wou'd not let us go to School any more, but provided a Tutor for us in the Hou&s;e; tho' he cou'd make nothing of my Brother <HI>John,</HI> for he was re&s;olv'd to remain a Dunce, which did not a little grieve both my Father and Mother, but there was no Remedy. Therefore <HI>John</HI> was re&s;olv'd for behind the Counter. The Time was fix'd to put him Apprentice to a Mercer, and me to the Univer&s;ity. I cou'd ea&s;ily perceive this Re|&s;olution,
<PB N="34" REF="40">
tho' both Father and Mother-in-law &s;eem'd to con&s;ent to it, was a great Grief to my Mother, and in a few Days I was con|firm'd in't.</P>
<P>At the End of our Garden was a large Summer-Hou&s;e, which I frequently made my Place of Study; having ju&s;t made an end of <HI>Claudian,</HI> I was going into the Hou&s;e to fetch another Book, but perceiving my Mo|ther at the End of one of the Walks, in or|der, as I &s;uppos'd, to come into the Summer-Hou&s;e, I &s;tep'd behind it, that I might not meet her. When &s;he came near me, I cou'd perceive by her Countenance &s;he was mighti|ly di&s;turb'd: She &s;taid in the Walk for her Maid, a few Minutes; when &s;he came to her, they both went up into the Summer-Hou&s;e; I found they were deep in Di&s;cour&s;e, there|fore mu&s;t own I had Curio&s;ity enough to li&s;ten awhile; but they &s;poke &s;o low, that I cou'd only hear now and then a Word, but yet enough to pick out it concern'd my Bro|ther <HI>John</HI> and my <HI>Self.</HI></P>
<P>I had left my <HI>Claudian</HI> above in the Win|dow of the Summer-Hou&s;e, which my Mo|ther perceiving, took it up. <HI>Ha!</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>this, I &s;uppo&s;e, is &s;ome of the Jackanapes</HI>'s <HI>Books! Ay, 'tis</HI> Latin, <HI>I believe, 'tis his.
<PB N="35" REF="41">
Well, I'll take care he &s;hall have Reading e|nough, I'll warrant him.</HI> And then &s;poke &s;o low, that I cou'd not hear the re&s;t. I li&s;ten'd farther, but whether they mi&s;tru&s;ted &s;ome|body was near 'em, or they were con&s;ulting &s;omething that was wicked, I can't tell, but they &s;poke &s;o low, that I cou'd not hear any thing but a continual Humming between 'em.</P>
<P>I went to my Study, but had no Inclina|tion to read; my Head run too much upon what I had heard, and what I &s;ugge&s;ted; the more I thought, the more Rea&s;on I had to be unea&s;y. I &s;ent a Servant to the Summer-Hou&s;e for the Book I had forgot; when he return'd, I ask'd him if there was any body in the Summer-Hou&s;e; he an&s;wer'd, There was my <HI>Lady,</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> in clo&s;e Con|ference; and farther added, they look'd up|on him with damn'd four Countenances for di&s;turbing 'em, as he &s;uppos'd.</P>
<P>I found every thing concurr'd with my Thoughts, which added very much to my di&s;contented Mind. When my Tutor came in, he perceiv'd by my Looks my Spirits were di&s;compos'd, and pre&s;&s;ing me to know the Rea&s;on, I told him I was not very well. At Supper (for my Tutor being a Gentleman of
<PB N="36" REF="42">
a good Family, that had &s;uffer'd many Mis|fortunes in the World, my Father allow'd him the Privilege of eating with us) he de|&s;ir'd my Father to order me a little Phy&s;ick, for I had complain'd I was indi&s;pos'd. My Father pre&s;s'd me to take it on the next Morning, but I told him it was nothing but too much Reading, and I &s;hou'd be well pre|&s;ently; but if I found my&s;elf wor&s;e, I wou'd take Phy&s;ic in a Day or two. Ay, &s;ays my Mother, whether you are better or no, you ought to take Phy&s;ic this Spring-time, and <HI>Johnny</HI> &s;hall take &s;ome along with you. So it was agreed in two Days to take it, and Word was &s;ent to the Apothecary's accord|ingly; tho' I re&s;olv'd with my&s;elf not to take any, as believing I wanted none, mine being an Illne&s;s of the Mind. When the Time came, the Do&s;es were &s;ent us, but I convey'd mine away without taking it.</P>
<P>At Dinner, my Mother &s;eem'd, as I thought, to look thro' me, and ask'd me many Que&s;tions concerning the Operation. I an&s;wer'd her as I thought proper. As &s;he ask'd her Maid (who always waited on her alone) for a Gla&s;s of Wine, I ob&s;erv'd &s;he look'd upon her with an odd &s;ort of a Coun|tenance; the Maid &s;eem'd to return her ano|ther
<PB N="37" REF="43">
Look, which plainly told me there was a Meaning between 'em. But the Di&s;cour&s;e was turn'd on another Subject, as being not altogether &s;o proper at Dinner; yet every now and then my Mother wou'd come out with &mdash; <HI>Sure,</HI> Billy, <HI>you did not take your Phy&s;ic!</HI> I confidently told her I did, tho' I abhor a Lye. Many odd Looks pa&s;s'd every Moment between the Mi&s;tre&s;s and the Maid during Dinner. When it was ended, they both went up into her Dre&s;&s;ing-Room; I cou'd not help following 'em with my Eyes, and &s;ecretly wi&s;h'd I cou'd have been near enough to hear their Conver&s;ation; but as that could not be, I was oblig'd to be contented without it.</P>
<P>In a little time my Mother came down a|gain; after &s;ome &s;hort Stay in the Dining-Room, my Father, Mother, Brother <HI>John,</HI> and I, as u&s;ual, went to walk in the Gar|den: <HI>John,</HI> as was his Cu&s;tom, ran &s;camper|ing before, and plaid many of his childi&s;h Tricks. Why, <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid my Father, why don't you do as your Brother <HI>Jacky</HI> does, 'twill make you &s;trong and lu&s;ty; all Study will &s;poil you, weaken your Con&s;titution, ay, and impair your Health. So it will re|ply'd my good Mother, I don't think he has
<PB N="38" REF="44">
a good State of Health, for he &s;eems to me as if he were in a Con&s;umption; ob&s;erve how pale he looks: Ay, but return'd my Fa|ther, that may be his Phy&s;ic. I don't know but it may, &s;ays &s;he; but, if I might ad|vi&s;e, he &s;hou'd take more in a few Days, as well as <HI>Jacky,</HI> for I am a&s;&s;ur'd 'twill do 'em good: Nay, further, my Dear (&s;aid &s;he to my Father) I intend to &s;ee <HI>Billy</HI> take his, for it runs in my Head he made away that he was to take in the Morning, for I know he hates Phy&s;ic. I endeavour'd to convince her of the contrary, which &s;he &s;eem'd to be|lieve.</P>
<P>The Time drew near that we were to take Phy&s;ic again, and I was putting my Inven|tion on the Stretch how to avoid it, for I found &s;he had re&s;olv'd to be by when we were to take it, which accordingly happen'd. When &s;he gave me mine, I let it &s;lip out of my Hand upon the Ground; this put her into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he gave me a Box on the Ear; but in a little time after &s;he begg'd my Pardon, ki&s;s'd me, put her Hand to her Pur&s;e, and gave me half a Guinea, de&s;iring I wou'd forget it; I promis'd her I wou'd, tho' I really cou'd not.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="45">When my Father came in, &s;he told him in a merry Manner, I was re&s;olv'd not to take any Phy&s;ic, for the young Rogue, &s;aid &s;he, let it &s;lip through his Fingers, which con|vinces me he play'd the &s;ame Trick with that the other Morning. I told my Father it was purely Accident. Well, well, <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid my Mother-in-law, let it be what it will, we &s;hall take care of the next, I warrant you. I don't know when that can be, my Dear, &s;aid my Father, for he mu&s;t go to his Uncle's this Afternoon, who begs to &s;ee him, and I can't tell when he will return. My Mo|ther made no An&s;wer to it, but &s;eem'd to be in much Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was very well pleas'd to go to my Un|cle's, not only to get rid of my Mother's Phy&s;ic, but to &s;ee him, who was more in|dulgent to me than my own Father, and it was thought by every one that I &s;hou'd be his Heir, for he was an old Batchelor, and never intended to marry.</P>
<P>While I was in my Study, plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the Thoughts of going to my Uncle's, my Father came in to me. <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid he, thy Mother has convinc'd me 'tis nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hou'd take Phy&s;ic before you go, &s;o that I have &s;ent an Excu&s;e to your Uncle, and let
<PB N="40" REF="46">
him know you will wait on him in two or three Days at farthe&s;t. I was confounded at what he &s;aid, yet I an&s;wer'd him, What he pleas'd. I cou'd not tell him what I thought of my Mother, and that I believ'd &s;he in|tended to give me &s;omething to injure me, for as it cou'd not be prov'd, it wou'd look only like Fear, or Malice; &s;o I e'en &s;et my|&s;elf to think how to avoid it.</P>
<P>At la&s;t I thought to get a Phial, the &s;ame Size of that &s;he brought me in the Morning, and fill it with &s;omething near the Colour, which &s;eem'd to me to be a dark Brown. But then the Difficulty wou'd be, how to put the Change upon her. In the Morning I had prepar'd my Phial, and when my Mother was going to pour it into a Gla&s;s for me to drink, I begg'd &s;he wou'd be pleas'd to let me drink it out of the Phial, for the Sight of it in a Gla&s;s turn'd my Stomach again&s;t it. Ay, my Dear, with all my Heart; any how, &s;o thou do&s;t but take it, reply'd my good Mother. When I had got it, I put the Change upon her, and drank what I had prepar'd. My Mother &s;eem'd mightily pleas'd, taking her Leave of me with a <HI>It's a good Child; keep thy&s;elf warm, my Dear.</HI> When &s;he was gone, I went into my Study,
<PB N="41" REF="47">
and began to examine the Bottle my Mother wou'd have had me taken. I found it had no ill Smell; but as I had not any Inclina|tion to ta&s;te it, I had Thoughts of trying the Experiment upon &s;ome dumb Creature, but cou'd not find in my Heart to be &s;o cru|el, yet had a va&s;t Inclination to know its Effects. At la&s;t I re&s;olv'd to give it to a Greyhound Bitch, who&s;e Surline&s;s had given me Occa&s;ion enough not to have any great Compa&s;&s;ion for her. I did not think it pro|per to do it in the Hou&s;e, &s;o took my Op|portunity to wheedle her into the Stable, when no one was there, but going to open her Jaws to pour it into her Mouth, &s;he flew at me, and ran away. In the Surprize, I let the Phial fall out of my Hand, which broke with the Fall. I was very unea&s;y I cou'd not make Proof of what I de&s;ign'd, for I knew it wou'd be to no purpo&s;e to di&s;|cover my Su&s;picions only.</P>
<P>When Dinner-time came I was call'd down, and ob&s;erv'd the Confu&s;ion of Faces were increas'd between the Mi&s;tre&s;s and the Maid, in&s;omuch that my Father cou'd not help taking Notice of it. Pray, my Dear, what has <HI>Betty</HI> (&s;aid my Father) done, for you look at her as if &s;he had committed &s;ome
<PB N="42" REF="48">
great Crime? What, I warrant, &s;he has not wa&s;h'd your Headcloaths to plea&s;e you, or &s;ome &s;uch Trifle. She knows what &s;he has done, &s;aid my Mother-in-law, well enough; but I don't think it worth my While to be an|gry about it. Well, but don't give her &s;uch &s;our Look then (return'd my Father) but pardon her, you'll &s;poil her Stomach to her Dinner, Child. My Father went on in a joco&s;e manner all Dinner-time, yet notwith|&s;tanding now and then Looks pa&s;t between 'em, that no body cou'd interpret but my|&s;elf, or at lea&s;t I thought I cou'd. I &s;ee, my Dear, cry'd my Father, the Peace is not made up between you; give me Leave to be the Judge in this Matter; but fir&s;t let me know the Ca&s;e: Come, <HI>Betty,</HI> continu'd my Father, you &s;eem to be the Offender, con|fe&s;s your Crime, and that's the Way to find Pardon the &s;ooner. Why, Sir, return'd the Maid, I have forgot to wa&s;h my Mi&s;tre&s;s's Lac'd Pinners, for which &s;he has been an|gry with me all this Morning. And is this the full and whole Hi&s;tory of her Crime, my Dear, &s;aid my Father to my Mother-in-law? Yes, return'd the good Woman. Why then I proceed to Judgment, &s;aid my Father.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="49">You, Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> not having the Fear of God before your Eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (here my Father ran on with the whole Sentence that a Judge repeats to one arraign'd for Murder, and du|ring the time of Speaking, I ob&s;erv'd <HI>Betty</HI> to be very much &s;tartled) &s;hall for your Puni&s;hment, before you &s;leep, wa&s;h and &s;tarch the&s;e &s;ame Headcloaths, and in &s;o do|ing, it &s;hall remain as a &s;ufficient Puni&s;h|ment for your heinous Crime, tho' you know you de&s;erve much wor&s;e; and be &s;ure for the future, you are never guilty of the like. <HI>Bet|ty</HI> promis'd, in a great deal of Confu&s;ion, to mend for the future.</P>
<P>The next Day was de&s;ign'd for me to wait on my Uncle, and tho' I had a great De&s;ire to go, yet I was not &s;atisfy'd; I was in va|rious Minds; &s;ometimes I fully intended to inform my Father with my Su&s;picions, with all the Circum&s;tances and Grounds for't. But then again, I con&s;ider'd my Su&s;picions might &s;trengthen my Opinion, and they might be really innocent. While I was wrapt in my Cogitations, I ob&s;erv'd my Mother and her Maid were going into the Garden, and I did not doubt but they wou'd get into the Sum|mer Hou&s;e, in order to another Conference. I &s;lipt into the Garden, and got to my Hi|ding-Place
<PB N="44" REF="50">
behind the Je&s;&s;amine-Hedge, be|fore they came. As &s;oon as they were up the Stairs of the Summer-Hou&s;e, my Mother ask'd her Maid if &s;he were a&s;&s;ur'd there was no one in the Garden; &s;he told her, No, nor none cou'd come in but &s;he cou'd perceive 'em from the Window where &s;he &s;at.</P>
<P>What can be the Meaning, &s;aid my Mo|ther, that this devili&s;h Brat does not feel the Effects of what he has taken? I am afraid either the Apothecary, or you, have betray'd me. Madam, return'd the Maid, I can a&s;|&s;ure you we are both innocent of your Su&s;pi|cion: As for his Part, he does not know who, or what it's for: Yet, Madam, I don't doubt but you'll be &s;urpris'd at what I am going to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P>I wou'd not, continu'd <HI>Betty,</HI> be guilty of what before Dinner I made no Scruple of, for the whole World. If you had ob&s;erv'd my Countenance, while my Ma&s;ter was judging my fictitious Crime, with the formal Introductions in Ca&s;es of Murder, you might have read my Guilt in my Face. I am a&s;|&s;ur'd Ma&s;ter <HI>Billy</HI> ob&s;erv'd me mo&s;t heedful|ly, and, to my thinking, his Eyes told me he knew my real Crime in the Intention. I was &s;ome time before I cou'd recover my
<PB N="45" REF="51">
Confu&s;ion, and I then weigh'd in the Scales of Ju&s;tice, the Rea&s;on of your Re&s;entment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">o him, and found the Intention to be the ut|mo&s;t Wickedne&s;s, and I thank'd my God our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">nhuman De&s;igns had not taken effect. You &s;ee Heaven is di&s;pleas'd, and &s;hews the Ab|horrence of the Fact, by hindring the Effect. I look'd in his Face during the latter Part of Dinner, and wonder'd how we cou'd plot to take away the Life of &s;o mucn Innocence, that never injur'd us. I thank Heaven, my Eyes are open'd, nor even the wor&s;t of Torments &s;hou'd make me once think of &s;uch a Crime. Therefore let me beg of you, my dear Mi&s;tre&s;s, to forget it, bury even the Thought of it: Con&s;ider the Crime; <HI>Murder</HI> is the greate&s;t Sin again&s;t God; 'tis even &s;triking at him, by murdering his Image. Let my Repentance be as the Alarm to yours. I am &s;ure, if you will give your&s;elf time to think, your Con&s;cience mu&s;t awake, and teach you to abhor the Crime. No one knows our wicked Intention, but all-&s;eeing Heaven, which will pardon us on a &s;incere Repentance. We are oblig'd to keep each other's Coun&s;el; therefore let me conjure you, by the Love you ought to owe your Hus|band! by your Duty to Heaven! which I
<PB N="46" REF="52">
&s;hou'd have mention'd fir&s;t; by the Worth of your eternal Soul! by the Affection you ought to owe your Children! for tho&s;e of your Husbands mu&s;t be yours, &s;ince you are but One: Con&s;ider what it is to have a clear and a quiet Con&s;cience, 'tis the only Happine&s;s on this &s;ide the Grave, 'tis that which &s;weet|ens all the Ills of Life; the Innocent will be happy, let Fortune empty her Quiver of Ma|lice on 'em. If the Weight of this will have no Con&s;ideration with you, think on the Welfare of this World, if you can lull to &s;leep your Con&s;cience. Murder has many Tongues to &s;peak, even things inanimate have divulg'd the Guilty; and when once re|veal'd, think on the Puni&s;hment that mu&s;t follow. I beg, Madam, take &s;ome little time to ruminate on what I have &s;aid, before you an&s;wer me; weigh it well, for it is of the la&s;t Importance; for tho' a poor, igno|rant, weak Woman, you'll find what I ut|ter to be the Oracle of Heaven.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Betty</HI> paus'd, as expecting an An|&s;wer; and during the Interval of Speech, the Agonies I felt at the intended Wickedne&s;s, were next to Death it&s;elf. After about a Mi|nute's Silence, my Mother &s;poke as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53"><HI>Betty,</HI> Words can hardly &s;peak the Tor|ments of my Mind; yet I have this to com|fort me, 'tis in Repentance to &s;et my Soul at re&s;t, and I do repent from the Bottom of my Heart. What a Fiend had I entertain'd in my Brea&s;t! How very near the Brink of Hell, his proper Habitation, had he brought me! Thou wert my Guardian-Angel, that &s;av'd me from De&s;truction! To Heaven and Thee I owe my Thanks. Now this Fury is gone forth my Bo&s;om, I think, with thee, how it cou'd be po&s;&s;ible to harbour &s;uch a Helli&s;h Thought again&s;t the poor Child; but, now I feel reviving Love, even equal to that of my own Son, I long to embrace and ki&s;s him with a real Mother's Fondne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Joy I felt at this Declaration, had al|mo&s;t made me di&s;cover my&s;elf, and it was hard to keep my Legs from running to my Mother to accept the long'd-for Ble&s;&s;ing; but Rea&s;on got the better of my Tran&s;port; That told me, I ought to conceal from all the World my Knowledge of the whole Affair. While I was in my Mu&s;ing, I cou'd hear <HI>Betty</HI> &s;ay, Madam, my Ma&s;ter's coming up the Walk, I beg you will compo&s;e your&s;elf. I'll do what I can, reply'd my Mother-in-law, but no one can imagine what Torments
<PB N="48" REF="54">
I feel. Then &s;it here, Madam, &s;aid <HI>Betty,</HI> for here it's dark, and my Ma&s;ter cannot per|ceive your Di&s;order. My Mother, as I &s;up|pos'd, remov'd to the Place &s;he de&s;ir'd her. Immediately after my Father came in, and ask'd 'em if they had &s;een me, for they had been &s;earching me all over the Hou&s;e, but cou'd not find me. My Brother's Man, &s;aid my Father, is waiting for him. My Mother reply'd I had not been there, but mu&s;t cer|tainly be in the Study. No, &s;aid my Father, he is not there, neither can I imagine where he can be, and the not finding him makes me very unea&s;y.</P>
<P>Upon &s;aying this, my Father went up and down the Walks calling me. When he had left the two Women, <HI>Betty</HI> cry'd out, I hope in Heaven my Repentance is accepted, and he has not now felt the Effect of the Poi&s;on. You fright me out of my Sen&s;es, return'd my Mother; let's run to &s;eek him. Away they went. When I was certain they were out of Sight, I clamber'd over the Wall, and came in the Street way, ju&s;t as my Mother with her Maid came out of the Garden. As &s;oon as my Mother met me, &s;he cla&s;p'd me about the Neck, and ki&s;s'd me with as much Tran&s;port as if I had been her own Son;
<PB N="49" REF="55">
which affected me in &s;uch a manner, I could not help weeping with Exce&s;s of Satisfaction. What means the&s;e Tears, my Child, &s;aid my Mother? Madam, &s;aid I, be not offended, they are Tears of Joy, to &s;ee you &s;o kind. Ble&s;s thee! my dear Boy, return'd my Mo|ther, I hope always to prove &s;o.</P>
<P>When my Father came in, he ask'd me where I had been; I told him, only to take a Walk in the Fields after my Phy&s;ic. We thought we had lo&s;t you, &s;aid my Father, and were &s;ending for the Cryer to cry a great Boy of Fifteen Years of Age? But come, continu'd he, mount! your Uncle's Man waits for you, and has done this Hour. Your Things &s;hall be there to-morrow Morning. I begg'd Leave only to pack up a few Books, and I wou'd wait on him in&s;tantly.</P>
<P>As I was in my Study, putting together what I intended to take with me, <HI>Betty</HI> came up to me. Well, Sir, &s;aid me, how do you find your&s;elf after your Phy&s;ic? Better than was expected this Morning, <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;aid I. I am very glad on't, reply'd <HI>Betty,</HI> I now believe you are, &s;aid I; but there's a great Alteration &s;ince Morning, and I hope it will continue. While I &s;aid this, I look'd &s;ted|fa&s;tly in her Face; &s;he ob&s;erving me, blu&s;h'd
<PB N="50" REF="56">
very much. Come, <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;aid I, 'tis ne|ver too late to repent, Repent, Sir! reply'd <HI>Betty,</HI> of what? Of doing Ill, I return'd, or even thinking Ill. I had but an ill Opi|nion of you this Morning; but I have Rea|&s;on to think I have done you Wrong, and I ask you Pardon; be &s;atisfy'd, I can &s;ome|times read Peoples Thoughts. Why then, &s;aid <HI>Betty,</HI> if it be &s;o, you know you have no Rea&s;on to ask my Pardon, for I am &s;ure you never offended me. But if I have ever offended you, I ask you, and Heaven, Par|don, and I hope I &s;hall obtain both. Be a&s;&s;ur'd you will, I reply'd. She &s;eeing me ready to go down, took her Leave of me, mode&s;tly begging leave to ki&s;s me. As I was going away; Sir, &s;aid &s;he, if we both are alive ten Year hence, and I have the Honour to &s;ee you, I may make you ac|quainted with &s;omething very extraordinary. Nothing but what I partly under&s;tand alrea|dy, I return'd; keep in the hone&s;t Path you are in, then Heaven will ble&s;s you.</P>
<P>I got on Hor&s;eback, after taking Leave of the Family, and ob&s;erv'd <HI>Betty</HI> in much Con|fu&s;ion; I &s;hook my Head at her, with a Smile, and rid away.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="57">When I arriv'd at my Uncle's, which was about fourteen Miles from my Father's, I was told by the Servants he was gone out a little way, not expecting me &s;o &s;oon; but he wou'd return in a Quarter of an Hour. Du|ring his Stay, a Coach came to the Door with a couple of old Ladies, and a young one about thirteen Years of Age, the beau|tifulle&s;t Creature my Eyes ever beheld: I cou'd not help gazing upon her, with a great deal of Delight. They came to vi&s;it my Uncle, but finding he was gone out, wou'd not &s;tay. I look'd after the Coach which car|ry'd this young Angel away, as far as ever I cou'd &s;ee, and began to feel a certain Ten|derne&s;s, which People, I thought, of my Years, had but little Knowledge of.</P>
<P>I was plea&s;ing my&s;elf with the charming Idea, when my Uncle came in, who expre&s;t a great deal of Satisfaction to &s;ee me. After the fir&s;t Civilities were over, I told him there was a Coach with &s;ome Ladies to wait upon him, but not meeting with him at home, wou'd not come in. My Uncle being a mer|ry joco&s;e Man, &s;aid to me, Sirrah, you &s;hou'd have done the Duties of my Hou&s;e, and <HI>made</HI> 'em come in. But who were they? I told him I cou'd not tell.

reply'd, They were my Lady &mdash; her Si&s;|ter and Daughter. Od&s;o! you young Dog, return'd my Uncle, there wou'd be a fine Wife, if you had but Money enough; &s;he's an Heire&s;s, and will be worth Fifty Thou|&s;and Pounds. Well Sir, &s;aid I, when I think on Marriage, I mu&s;t not turn my Thoughts that way. No! why &s;o? reply'd my Uncle; a Woman with a Fortune is as &s;oon got as one without; and when I die, you don't know what may happen.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, if I never marry till I wi&s;h your Death, I hope to live &s;ingle a great while. I believe thee, <HI>Will,</HI> &s;aid my Uncle: But 'tis time enough to talk of the&s;e things ten Year hence; I wou'd have no Man mar|ry till they are pa&s;t Twenty, nor Women till pa&s;t Sixteen. I wonder, Sir, &s;aid I, you never thought of that State! Why, you young Rogue, &s;o I have, reply'd my Uncle, &s;o much on't, that I re&s;olve to live &s;ingle all my Life; and I am of the Opinion, few People marry only to better their Condition. That's a little too hard, Sir, &s;aid I: Do you ima|gine no one marries for Love? O yes, a great many, reply'd my Uncle; but it does not la&s;t long: Lovers have large Stomachs, but are &s;oon cloy'd, they very often &s;urfeit the
<PB N="53" REF="59">
fir&s;t Meal I told him, My Mother, his Si&s;ter, I thought, lov'd my Father till the Day of her Death. She was contented, I believe, reply'd my Uncle. But come, young Man, this Di&s;cour&s;e is a little too wi&s;e for one of your Years. Not at all, &s;aid I, Uncle; I hope you will not take it ill, if I declare your Notions of Matrimony won't hinder me to try my Fortune, when my Inclination &s;erves, and a good Match &s;hou'd offer. No, &s;aid my Uncle, I hope to &s;ee thee wedded to a good Fortune before I die; therefore I intend to carry thee to my Lady <HI>S</HI> &mdash; and there you may grow acquainted with the young Lady; your Age is much the &s;ame, and your Corre&s;pondence may be continu'd as your Years increa&s;e; be&s;ide, I wou'd have you have &s;ome Place to go to, for it wou'd be hard to have nothing but an old mu&s;ty Un|cle to conver&s;e with. Age does not very well agree with Youth.</P>
<P>Our Conver&s;ation la&s;ted much longer upon this Topic; and it might have la&s;ted longer than it did, if Supper had not come in to &s;top my Uncle's Mouth. His Hou&s;ekeeper &s;at down at Supper with us, which I thought a little odd; but I &s;oon found how Matters went, and, young as I was, I cou'd perceive
<PB N="54" REF="60">
Madam was Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Family. She ap|pear'd extremely civil to me, even, as I thought, too civil; for her Behaviour &s;eem'd to &s;ay, <HI>Ob&s;erve! I am Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Hou&s;e, and 'tis to me you are beholden for your Enter|tainment.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day I cou'd not help hinting to my Uncle, &s;omething of his Hou&s;ekeeper's Behaviour. Why, <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid my Uncle, this Woman is a good Woman, in her Way, and I &s;hou'd be at a great Lo&s;s without her; for, as I have many Servants, and being a &s;ingle Man, I &s;hou'd be but a &s;curvy Mana|ger of 'em: Now this Woman, being pru|dent and di&s;creet, knows how to manage &s;uch a Kennel of wild Hounds as I am forc'd to keep, out of State indeed, for I have not Service for 'em half: But a Man of Fortune mu&s;t live &s;omething an&s;werable to it, or he will be de&s;pis'd by his Neighbours. Once a Man has got in that Road, he mu&s;t not get out of it again.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, I beg your Pardon for being &s;o inqui&s;itive, and, may be, impertinent. <HI>Billy,</HI> reply'd my Uncle, you may &s;ay and do ju&s;t what you will here, for I wou'd have you to under&s;tand, this Hou&s;e, and all that's in it, is not only yours when I die, but the
<PB N="55" REF="61">
E&s;tate that belongs to it, which is upward of Two Thou&s;and Pounds a Year; and to con|vince you of it, I de&s;ign to make my Will forthwith. I have &s;o much Confidence in you, to believe I &s;hall never have Occa&s;ion to alter it. I beg you, Sir, &s;aid I, don't talk of making of Wills, and Death, 'tis a me|lancholy Subject, and whatever you will be pleas'd to leave me, will not compen&s;ate the Grief I &s;hou'd feel for the Lo&s;s of &s;o good an Uncle. Why, you Fool, reply'd my Un|cle, I believe you; but I hope a Man is ne|ver the nearer Death for talking on't, or ma|king his Will!</P>
<P>We were interrupted in our Di&s;cour&s;e, by a Servant's giving my Uncle a Letter, which he read to him&s;elf, and &s;mil'd. Here, &s;aid my Uncle, read that, there's a Billet, who&s;e Style may be altogether new to you; 'tis wrote by a young Lady, and a fine Lady, tho' dictated by an old one. I took it, and read as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. IRONFACE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE all think you a good-for-nothing, fu&s;|ty old Fellow, as indeed all old Batche|lors are, which is the only Motive prevails up|on us to forgive your being abroad Ye&s;terday,
<PB N="56" REF="62">
when we came to wait upon your Wor&s;hip. However, you mu&s;t not expect Ab&s;olution, before you have done Penance, which is, to come and Dine with us to Day, and &s;tay as long as we &s;hall think fit. Your Compliance &s;hall be&s;peak &s;ome Favour from</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your enraged Judges, MINOS, RHADAMANTHUS, <HI>and</HI> AEACUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>A very merry, free Epi&s;tle, indeed, Sir, &s;aid I. 'Tis the Style, &s;aid my Uncle, we u&s;e in Writing to one another; and if any other Form &s;hou'd pa&s;s between us, we &s;hou'd fan&s;y each other offended at &s;omething. But come, Youth, continu'd my Uncle, you mu&s;t &s;mug up your&s;elf, and go along with me, for this is the Place I intend to bring you ac|quainted in; for now they have honour'd me with the Title of Knight of the Shire, I am now and then oblig'd to be with &s;ome Bot|tle-Companions, which will not altogether a|gree with your Age, or Con&s;titution; &s;o that I hope you will like the Company I &s;hall provide for you; and tho' the One is the Mother, and the Other Aunt to the young Creature I was &s;peaking of, yet they are nei|ther of 'em Forty; the one is a Widow, and
<PB N="57" REF="63">
the other an old Maid, if we may call her one at Eight and Thirty; but &s;he has no|thing of the Stiffne&s;s or Formality of that State, but is as ea&s;y and good-humour'd, as if &s;he had lo&s;t that weighty Burden, a <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> twenty Year ago; and, what is more &s;urpri&s;ing, re&s;olves to die a Maid, ex|cept &s;ome brawny Ra&s;cal does her the Favour to ravi&s;h her. The Widow, and Mother to the young Lady, has been in the State of Widowhood near Fourteen Year, for her Daughter was Po&s;thumous-born; yet, tho' &s;he is Mi&s;tre&s;s of a va&s;t Fortune, and con&s;e|quently been &s;ought by many in Marriage, (for Money is the Load&s;tone that draws all the World) yet &s;he re&s;olves never to change her State. The&s;e Three, with their Family, live as contentedly as any Three in the Uni|ver&s;e. 'Tis here I go, when I have a mind to be innocently merry, without bringing any Scandal to the Family, becau&s;e I am an old Fellow. They have fitted up an Apartment for me in particular, and I very often &s;tay all Night. Sir, &s;aid I, I &s;uppo&s;e the Rea&s;on why the Widow does not marry again, is the Love &s;he bears to the Memory of her former Husband. Rather, I believe, the Vexation &s;he receiv'd from him, reply'd my Uncle, hin|ders
<PB N="58" REF="64">
her; for I have heard her often &s;ay, he us'd to lead her a damn'd &s;ort of Life; and his Behaviour to her has confirm'd the Si&s;ter in the &s;ame Mind. She often declares to me, in her Thoughts, the be&s;t of Husbands are but Plagues, which I return by imagining the &s;ame thing by the Wives; &s;o we &s;trengthen each other's Opinion by our Conver&s;ation; which is &s;omething odd, you'll &s;ay.</P>
<P>But I forget, continu'd my Uncle, that I am talking to a School-Boy all this time. Sir, I return'd, whatever you &s;ay to me, &s;hall do me no Injury, but rather improve my Under|&s;tanding; Things of Moment, I &s;hall ju&s;tly weigh; and what is not nece&s;&s;ary to be re|member'd, &s;hall be forgot. My Uncle made me many Compliments of my forward Sen&s;e; but at the Tag of all, to qualify 'em, told me, <HI>Ripe Fruit was &s;oon rotten</HI>; and &s;o we both went to equip our&s;elves for our &s;hort Journey.</P>
<P>In the Coach, my Uncle told me, I &s;hould do well to ingratiate my&s;elf with the Family; for if I was ever to enter into the Matrimo|nial State, I cou'd not do better for my&s;elf; for, added he, tho' Marriage is a very bit|ter Pill, yet there's Gold enough to gild it over, and a hand&s;ome young Lady to-boot.
<PB N="59" REF="65">
I told him, whenever that Time came, I &s;hou'd value his Advice at the highe&s;t Rate. Come, come, reply'd the old Gentleman, I don't love Compliments, they &s;avour of In|&s;incerity. I return'd, my Tongue and Heart ever did, and I hop'd ever wou'd, go toge|ther; and whatever I &s;aid, it &s;hou'd be Truth. Ay, but Boy, an&s;wer'd the old Gentleman, you know the old Saying, <HI>Truth is not to be &s;poke at all Times</HI>; many a poor Man has &s;uf|fer'd for &s;peaking Truth.</P>
<P>When we came to the End of our &s;hort Journey, the two Si&s;ters (who were both comely Women) came to the Gate to bid us welcome; the young Lady, they gave us to under&s;tand, was walking in the Garden. When we were brought into the Parlour, af|ter the u&s;ual Civilities, my Uncle told 'em, he had brought along with him a Per&s;on that he de&s;ign'd one of their Acquaintance, and if they balk'd his Intention, he threaten'd 'em &s;everely with his Indignation. The Ladies reply'd, I &s;hou'd be welcome upon my own Account, without his Recommendation. Well, well, reply'd my Uncle, I don't care how it's done, &s;o it is done. But hold, cry'd the Aunt, won't it be &s;omething dangerous to al|low him the Conver&s;ation and Acquaintance
<PB N="60" REF="66">
of <HI>I&s;abella?</HI> (meaning the young Lady) he'll perhaps, in time, wipe away from her Me|mory the good Advice again&s;t Matrimony, we have taken much Time and Labour to in|culcate.</P>
<P>Fear not that, reply'd my Uncle, for I have, and &s;hall take as much Pains with the Youth, that they may be on a Footing. Up|on this, the young Lady came in, to who&s;e Acquaintance I was introduc'd. Tho' &s;he was the hand&s;ome&s;t Creature my Eyes e'er beheld, the Charms of her Per&s;on were e|quall'd by tho&s;e of her Under&s;tanding; and I &s;oon found, young as I was, Love had ta|ken full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Heart.</P>
<P>The Conver&s;ation of the Day was chiefly compos'd of Mirth, and laughing at former Tran&s;actions, which were larded, every now and then, with Contempt upon the connubial State; and I was almo&s;t ready to die with De&s;pair, to hear the fair <HI>I&s;abella</HI> join with 'em, with more than ordinary Malice and Sa|tyr.</P>
<P>My Uncle de&s;ir'd &s;he wou'd not be &s;o in|veterate, for &s;he was taking the only Method for him to fall directly in Love with her. And that's the only way, reply'd the Si&s;ter, to get rid of your trouble&s;ome Company. I
<PB N="61" REF="67">
told the Lady, I hop'd my Uncle wou'd not prove trouble&s;ome, 'till &s;uch a Declaration. I believe not, young Gentleman, reply'd the Lady; but I fear there's much more Danger from your Wor&s;hip, than your Uncle; your Years will bring you forward, but his will make him lag behind. I told her, I &s;hou'd always endeavour to keep my&s;elf in the good Graces of that Family; and that nothing but De&s;tiny &s;hou'd make me forfeit it.</P>
<P>Oh then, return'd the Lady, if it ever comes to that, the Fault mu&s;t be laid on <HI>De|&s;tiny, Fate, Ill Stars,</HI> and I know not what! I tell you, continu'd the Si&s;ter, &s;miling, if your Years did not plead for you, I &s;hou'd begin to think you guilty. I mu&s;t own, tho' this was but Rallying, I cou'd not help blu&s;h|ing at what &s;he &s;aid, as knowing my&s;elf a Criminal already.</P>
<P>Bed-time broke up our Company, and e|very one retir'd to their &s;everal Apartments. When I was alone, Reflexion began to make me very unea&s;y. The blind God had wound|ed me, tho' not &s;o deep as if I had more Years over my Head, yet enough to break my Re&s;t, and trouble and confu&s;e my young Imagination. I got up at the Dawn of Day, as unea&s;y as I went to Bed, and walk'd in the
<PB N="62" REF="68">
Garden alone, for none of the Family were &s;tirring. All my Thoughts were bu&s;ied on the fair Object of my Wi&s;hes. I continu'd, in my unea&s;y Contemplation, &s;everal Hours.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that interrupted my Meditations, was the Charmer of my Heart, who came to me, with a &s;miling Countenance. I am in|form'd, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, you were early up this Morning, I fear you did not like your Lodg|ing! There's nothing in this Hou&s;e, I re|ply'd, but what I have the utmo&s;t Regard for; but (I continu'd) it was my u&s;ual Cu|&s;tom of ri&s;ing early to my Studies. We fell in&s;en&s;ibly into the Affairs of the Family, for I had not Courage once to mention what I felt within my Brea&s;t; neither did I imagine &s;he cou'd have a right Conception of what my Inclination wou'd have declar'd to her. Among other things, I told her, we &s;hou'd have the World unpeopled, if every body was of her Mother, Aunt, and my Uncle's Mind. She reply'd, there was no Danger of that, for the Men wou'd find Means to have Heirs to their E&s;tates, without trou|bling the Par&s;on</P>
<P>I was a little confus'd at her An&s;wer, for I imagin'd &s;he in&s;inuated I was de&s;ign'd my Uncle's Heir, and therefore cou'd hardly
<PB N="63" REF="69">
make her an An&s;wer; for my Uncle told me, when he mention'd making his Will, that I was the fir&s;t that knew his Inclina|tion, and gave me a particular Charge to keep it a Secret from every one, till he him|&s;elf divulg'd it. It was &s;ome time before I cou'd recover my Confu&s;ion; for I was not a&s;&s;ur'd they might not hint &s;omething of it to my Uncle, and do me a Prejudice with him; not as to the E&s;tate, for I little regarded my Intere&s;t, but fearing I was not capable of keeping a Secret, even of the utmo&s;t Con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>The young Lady, finding &s;he had created &s;ome Confu&s;ion in my Thoughts, began to comfort me, with telling me, my Uncle's Mind might alter; and tho, he was &s;tiff in his Opinion concerning Matrimony, did not doubt but his Eyes wou'd be open enough to &s;ee Merit, where it was &s;o con&s;picuous. Her endeavouring to bring me out of Confu&s;ion, plung'd me farther into it, and &s;ometimes I was thinking &s;he was uttering Riddles, and I knew not how to an&s;wer upon the Topic: But at la&s;t I told her, Whatever my Uncle &s;hou'd think fit to do concerning his world|ly Affairs, &s;hou'd never trouble me, while he continu'd to do things corre&s;pondent with
<PB N="64" REF="70">
Honour and Hone&s;ty. I am very glad to hear it, reply'd the young Lady; and I fan|&s;y young Gentlemen, like you, who &s;tudy much, acquire Under&s;tanding, Fortitude, and Re&s;olution, and all other Manly Virtues, before their Years write 'em Men. Madam, I reply'd, in &s;ome it might be &s;o; but I had made no Progre&s;s in any of 'em, but one, and that I fear'd will be rather counted a Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>I fan&s;y then, return'd the Lady, &s;ince you own it a Frailty, you will make me your Confe&s;&s;or; and if I judge it to be, as you call it, a Weakne&s;s, I'll tell you what Pe|nance you &s;hall undergo for Pardon. Ma|dam, I reply'd, you are the only Per&s;on in the World that I will confe&s;s to; but then, you mu&s;t promi&s;e me, like a true Confe&s;&s;or, to keep it for ever a Secret from all the World, whether it di&s;plea&s;es you, or not; tho' I am under di&s;mal Apprehen&s;ions of lo|&s;ing your Favour, more dear to me than all the World.</P>
<P>Heyday! reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> if we were not both too young, I &s;hou'd imagine you were going to make Love to me. Madam, I an|&s;wer'd, you have gue&s;s'd the very Secret of my Heart. The tender Thoughts my Brea&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="71">
contains, are all for you. Don't think it a Boyi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion, apt to change; for whatever U&s;age I meet with from you, I mu&s;t conti|nue to adore you. I have weigh'd our Years; yours and your Family's Aver&s;ion to Matri|mony, by your Ye&s;terday's Di&s;cour&s;e; and no Con&s;ideration can put a Stop to my Pa&s;|&s;ion: All the Favour I ask, or de&s;ire, is on|ly Leave &s;ilently to adore you; and if you find your Heart aver&s;e to my con&s;tant Wi&s;hes, let me beg you to grant me Pity for all that I &s;hall &s;uffer, and I &s;hall rejoice at every Pang I feel, becau&s;e they are for you. I am con|vinc'd your Under&s;tanding far exceeds your Years, therefore I intreat you to think be|you &s;peak; and con&s;ider this, 'tis in your Power alone, to make me live, or die. I own our Fortunes are at pre&s;ent unequal, but Time may produce many things; in&s;pir'd by you, I wou'd aim at every thing that is ho|nourable to de&s;erve you that Way, nor &s;hou'd I doubt &s;ucceeding. I &s;aid every thing my Tongue cou'd utter, prompted by Love, and had this Satisfaction, to ob&s;erve her Face was not dre&s;s'd in Frowns. After many rallying Speeches, finding me continue in my Di|&s;tre&s;s:</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="72">Well, &s;aid &s;he, as I promis'd to be your Confe&s;&s;or, I'll keep it a Secret, as we agreed on; and perhaps, if I thought you in ear|ne&s;t, I &s;hou'd think of &s;ome Puni&s;hment e|qual to what your Crime de&s;erves: But you have been reading <HI>Ovid</HI> lately, I &s;uppo&s;e, and you wou'd be endeavouring to put &s;ome of his Rules in practice upon me. It is a plea&s;ing Satisfaction to me, I reply'd, to hear you under&s;tand <HI>Ovid</HI> &s;o well; and, by your Choice, I hope you will remember all his Rules. What! return'd the young La|dy, becau&s;e I have read that Author, as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tran&s;lators have given him to us (for I own I am not &s;o happy to under&s;tand the Original) wou'd you interpret for me, that I like the Subject? No, continu'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I have read <HI>Reynolds</HI> on Murder, and yet I hope you will believe I abhor the Facts related there. I hope fo too, Madam, I reply'd; therefore you will con&s;ider, that what my Tongue utter'd, was from the very Bottom of my Soul; and if you will not receive my Declaration favourably, you will be the Death of me, which will make you a pa&s;&s;ive Mur|derer.</P>
<P>Few People, I believe, die for Love, in this Age, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; however, our
<PB N="67" REF="73">
Years will protect both of us. I told her, the Tree that took deepe&s;t Root, &s;tood the longe&s;t. Yes, returned <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and the Im|pre&s;&s;ions cut in young Barks, &s;oone&s;t wear out; and often kill the Tree, Madam, &s;aid I. Well, well, cry'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> we have had enough on this Subject for once. Madam, &s;aid I, does the Word <HI>Once</HI> imply you wou'd pardon me whenever Fortune will give me another Opportunity of declaring my Pa&s;&s;ion? I have not Time now to an&s;wer you (&s;aid <HI>I&s;abella</HI>) for I perceive your Uncle, my Mo|ther, and Aunt, are coming towards us. But I thought her Words were accompanied with &s;o &s;weet a Look, that bid me hope; and Hope is all the Plea&s;ure of our Lives.</P>
<P>When we had join'd Company, we were the Theme of the old Folks Raillery for &s;ome time. Hark you, young Man, &s;aid my Un|cle, how came you to ri&s;e &s;o early this Morn|ing? Only becau&s;e I do it every Morning, Sir, &s;aid I, to read. Why, Sirrah, &s;aid my Uncle, if I had thought you had brought a Book along with you here, I wou'd have ta|ken it from you, and burnt it. Is not here Contemplation enough for you? pointing to the Ladies. Yes, Sir, reply'd the Mother, I think he does well to have &s;omething to en|tertain
<PB N="68" REF="74">
his Thoughts, alone, for I don't much reli&s;h the young Ones getting together &s;o ear|ly; I don't well know how they cou'd enter|tain them&s;elves, without talking of Love. Why, if we &s;hou'd, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> 'twou'd be only to fortify each other again&s;t that Pa&s;|&s;ion. Well, well, &s;aid the Aunt, your Ages &s;ecure you at pre&s;ent; but I &s;hou'd be loth to tru&s;t you five or &s;ix Years hence. Ay but, &s;aid my Uncle, <HI>Will</HI> &s;tudies the Mathematics, and he knows every thing of <HI>Geography</HI> and <HI>Navigation</HI> already, but ju&s;t going to Sea; and can tell you in what Latitude the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> lies under, tho' he was never there; he has all the <HI>Theory,</HI> and only wants the <HI>Practice.</HI></P>
<P>None of your Allegories, reply'd the Mo|ther; I have a very good Opinion of the young Gentleman, therefore hold your Tongue, for what you can &s;ay for him, will only le&s;&s;en it. Come, come, the Tea &s;tays for us, &s;aid the Aunt. I'm glad on't, cry'd my Uncle, for now we &s;hall have a little Scandal, Tea has no Reli&s;h without it.</P>
<P>My Uncle having no Bu&s;ine&s;s at home, we continu'd in this agreeable Company three whole Days; and tho' we were to receive a Vi&s;it from them in two more, yet the Sepa|ration
<PB N="69" REF="75">
from that I held mo&s;t dear on Earth, was very irk&s;ome to me; but the Hope of &s;eeing her &s;o &s;oon, mitigated my Grief.</P>
<P>When we came home to my Uncle's, I ob&s;erv'd a Youth walking in the Garden, ve|ry near my own Age, as I cou'd gue&s;s at the Di&s;tance I &s;aw him; for as &s;oon as he per|ceiv'd me, he walk'd another way, as not being willing I &s;hou'd &s;ee him. I ask'd one of the Servants that happen'd to be in the Garden, who that Youth was I ju&s;t before &s;aw at the Fountain. He reply'd, it was the Hou&s;ekeeper's Son. What, is the Hou&s;e|keeper marry'd then, &s;aid I? Not now, re|ply'd the Servant, and &s;mil'd. Ob&s;erving the Humour of the Man, by his Counte|nance, I ask'd him many Que&s;tions concern|ing the Hou&s;ekeeper and her Child, but could not learn who was the Father po&s;itive|ly; yet he gave me Hints enough to ima|gine my Uncle had &s;ome Intere&s;t in the Af|fair, which created in me a great deal of Un|ea&s;ine&s;s; for it &s;oon occurr'd to my Memory what the divine <HI>I&s;abella</HI> told me in her Mo|ther's Garden, <HI>that Heirs to E&s;tates might be procur'd without the Help of the Par&s;on.</HI> My Unea&s;ine&s;s did not proceed from any Di&s;ap|pointment relating to the E&s;tate, any farther

than I thought it might have reconcil'd me to <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Family; for I imagin'd if ever I cou'd move her Heart to love me, &s;he wou'd as much de&s;pi&s;e Riches as my&s;elf; for even, young as I was, I cou'd have been contented to have got my Sub&s;i&s;tence from my daily Labour, if <HI>I&s;abella</HI> wou'd have &s;ubmitted to have &s;har'd my Fortune; for I never once thought of hers, but I wi&s;h'd it much le&s;s, or rather none at all, that I might have been more on the Equality.</P>
<P>While I was mu&s;ing on the State of my Love, I was interrupted by my Uncle's Hou&s;ekeeper, who, with a familiar Air, in|quir'd concerning our Entertainment at the Widow's: I found, by her Di&s;cour&s;e, the poor Creature was jealous of my Uncle, and to increa&s;e her Opinion, I told her, I fan&s;y'd we &s;hou'd &s;hortly have a Wedding, for it look'd very like it. Between whom? ask'd the Hou&s;ekeeper, ha&s;tily; why, between my Uncle and the Widow, I an&s;wer'd. I ob|&s;erv'd her Countenance change at what I &s;aid, and a very great Di&s;order appear'd about her. But I did not think fit to have any further Conver&s;ation with her, &s;o left her to her own di&s;order'd Thoughts.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="77">When my Uncle and I were together, he ask'd me how I lik'd the young Lady (for he had not an Opportunity to ask me in the Coach as we came home, becau&s;e we brought a neighbouring Gentleman home with us, that came to make a Vi&s;it at the Widow's) I told him, I had a very great Regard for her, and I did not doubt but my Years wou'd in|crea&s;e it. I wou'd advi&s;e you, &s;aid my Un|cle, to make your Addre&s;&s;es there, but &s;e|cretly, for I am convinc'd you won't meet with a more beneficial Match. I an&s;wer'd my Uncle, I was of his Opinion; tho' not from the Greatne&s;s of her Fortune, but from the Charms of her Per&s;on and Under&s;tanding. Why, I wou'd have you affect what you marry; but, I hope you don't imagine, young Man, &s;aid my Uncle, a good For|tune will be any Hindrance. Not in the lea&s;t, Sir, &s;aid I; but I wou'd have no Two join in that holy Ceremony, if they cou'd not de|&s;pi&s;e Fortune. Well, well, reply'd my Un|cle, Experience will tell you another Tale, when you have a few Years more over your Head, which is now fill'd with Notions of Honour, and I know not how many chime|rical Ideas, that have their Being in thy Brain; You read too much.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="78">I hope, Sir, &s;aid I, Reading is de&s;ign'd to cultivate the Under&s;tanding, and rai&s;e our Imaginations above the Vulgar. I am of the Opinion, a Man of Quality with a <HI>Plebeian</HI> Soul, is a <HI>Plebeian</HI>; and on the contrary, a <HI>Plebeian</HI> with exalted Merit, ought to change Fortunes with him. But you forget, with all your Learning and Philo&s;ophy, that For|tune's blind, young Man, reply'd my Uncle, and di&s;tributes her Favours as blindly. I have &s;een Dullne&s;s and Stupidity in a Coach and Six, while Virtue, Merit, and a whole Library of Learning walk on Foot. The more Shame to the degenerate Age, you'll &s;ay, young Man. True, Sir, &s;aid I; and if I had a Fortune an&s;werable to my Inclina|tion, I wou'd never &s;ee one of tho&s;e you men|tion'd la&s;t, twice in the &s;ame Condition.</P>
<P>Don't think, reply'd my Uncle, that I am endeavouring to blot out tho&s;e Notions of Virtue that I &s;ee wrote in thy Soul; for it is on the Con&s;ideration of thy noble Inclinations, that I have lately re&s;olv'd in my Will, to leave thee a con&s;iderable Fortune, being a&s;|&s;ur'd thou wilt make the right U&s;e of it. The Bulk of my E&s;tate was left me by an Uncle, an old Batchelor as I am, which I intend to leave to thee in the &s;ame manner.
<PB N="73" REF="79">
Neither can I think thy good Under&s;tanding, Boy, continu'd my Uncle, will receive any Prejudice from our Contempt of the Mar|riage State; tho' the Rea&s;on why I have not chang'd my Condition, is, that the fir&s;t Ob|ject of my Wi&s;hes was, by Fate, deny'd me. But I &s;uppo&s;e you have heard your Father often repeat the Story. Never in my Life, I reply'd; for I have been at School ever &s;ince Five Years old, and very &s;eldom con|vers'd with any of the Family; and I may ju&s;tly &s;ay, Sir, that I am almo&s;t as great a Stranger in the Knowledge of my Ance&s;tors, as one that never heard of us: Well then, &s;aid my Uncle, I'll let you into as much as I know of 'em.</P>
<P>We are originally <HI>Welch:</HI> Many of our Ance&s;tors have flouri&s;h'd in the Church, as well as State, and left a &s;weet Scent of Vir|tue in their A&s;hes. I was the younge&s;t of three; the elde&s;t dying in the Wars, when he had gain'd many ever-living Laurels. Your Father prov'd Heir to the E&s;tate, who is one Year elder than my&s;elf. My Father's Brother having acquir'd a great E&s;tate by Merchandize, in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and having an In|clination for me, always declar'd me his Heir, and I liv'd with him as &s;uch; there|fore
<PB N="74" REF="80">
I think it almo&s;t your Due to be Heir to mine. About the Age of Seventeen, I fell in Love with a young Lady of a very &s;mall Fortune, but that was &s;upply'd by the Charms of her Mind and Per&s;on. Her Mo|ther (for her Father had been dead many Years) was aver&s;e to my Pa&s;&s;ion. She wou'd often tell her Daughter, I was but a younger Brother; and tho' every Body imagin'd I was to be Heir to my Uncle, yet no body was a&s;&s;ur'd of it. Old Men were as &s;ubject to change their Minds, as young ones; therefore &s;he wou'd by no means con&s;ent to my Court&s;hip; but when &s;he found I conti|nu'd my Addre&s;&s;es, &s;he &s;ecretly inform'd my Uncle, who took me to task on the other &s;ide; with many Arguments, prov'd I &s;hou'd be much to blame to think of a Woman of &s;uch a narrow Fortune, when, in Pro&s;pect, I was Ma&s;ter of &s;uch a large one; and hint|ed to me, if I continu'd in my Folly, as he call'd it, I might be balk'd of my Expecta|tion.</P>
<P>Tho' my Love was as great as cou'd be, yet I thought it was but common Prudence to di&s;&s;emble; and I told my Uncle, I hop'd I &s;hou'd never give him any Occa&s;ion to for|feit the good Opinion he had already con|ceiv'd
<PB N="75" REF="81">
of me. He gave me very good Ad|vice, which I promis'd to follow. But every thing mu&s;t &s;ubmit to Love; Fortune, Inte|re&s;t, Relations, and Friend&s;hip, mu&s;t give way to that &s;oft Pa&s;&s;ion. And I doubt not, young Man, notwith&s;tanding your Learning and pretended Fortitude, but Time will con|vince you of what I &s;ay. I &s;igh'd, and was in &s;ome Confu&s;ion at my Uncle's Di&s;cour&s;e, but made him no An&s;wer, becau&s;e I wou'd not interrupt him.</P>
<P>By &s;ecret Interviews, continu'd my Uncle, I gain'd the Heart of the young Lady, un|bia&s;s'd by her Intere&s;t; for in the mean time &s;he was courted by a Gentleman, po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of a Fortune much beyond the Hopes of her Family, who &s;oon gain'd the Mo|ther's Con&s;ent, and, being an ob&s;tinate Wo|man, &s;he promis'd him her Daughter's. In the mean time we met almo&s;t every Night, by the Help of the Maid, who by Bribes and Promi&s;es was in my Intere&s;t; and one Even|ing among the re&s;t, I took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the willing Fair One.</P>
<P>Our Amours were not &s;o &s;ecret as we ima|gin'd; for my Rival being inform'd of our Corre&s;pondence, tho' he had no Notion how far our Intimacy was carry'd, &s;ent me a Chal|lenge,
<PB N="76" REF="82">
which I accepted of, tho' unwillingly; for I am of that Opinion, Men's Honour of|ten prompts 'em on to tho&s;e Acts their Con|&s;ciences and Wills wou'd leave undone. We met, and Fortune declar'd in my Favour, by dangerou&s;ly wounding my Adver&s;ary, with|out my receiving the lea&s;t Hurt. The Mo|ther to the Fair One was exa&s;perated to the la&s;t Degree, and, in the Heat of her blind Rage, took her Daughter along with her to vi&s;it her intended Son-in-law, where &s;he a|greed, notwith&s;tanding his Wounds, and her Daughter's Cries and Lamentations, to mar|ry 'em immediately, which was perform'd.</P>
<P>You may gue&s;s what we both felt at this Shock of Fate, for Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had heighten'd my Pa&s;&s;ion. I tore and rav'd like a Mad|man, and was almo&s;t incon&s;olable; and no|thing but the Regard I ow'd my Uncle, kept me from doing &s;ome ra&s;h Act. But Time, that cures mo&s;t Sorrows, gave me &s;ome Con|&s;olation, as imagining I &s;hou'd have &s;till a Corre&s;pondence with the di&s;con&s;olate Fair One, for her continu'd Sorrow convinc'd me &s;he mourn'd for the &s;ame Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>I took an Opportunity, and got a Letter convey'd to her; but what was my Surprize and Sorrow at her An&s;wer! I have read it

&s;o often, and 'tis &s;o well imprinted in my Memory, that I can repeat it <HI>verbatim.</HI></P>

<P><HI>I</HI> AM now going, I firmly believe, into ano|ther World, to an&s;wer for my Mi&s;carriages in this, for I find the Pangs of Child-Birth up|on me, which I hope, and am almo&s;t a&s;&s;ur'd,

</LETTER>
<P>I was &s;o far plung'd in Grief at the Know|ledge of her State, that I went into the Fields to have more Freedom for Contempla|tion; and tho' it was Morning when I re|ceiv'd the Letter, I had not thought of re|turning, if the Curtain of the Night had not began to &s;pread the Hemi&s;phere; but ere I cou'd get out of the Fields, I heard &s;ome|body walk very fa&s;t behind me, and turning about, I was &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee the Husband of <HI>Maria,</HI> with his Sword drawn in his Hand, as ready to attack me. Tho' I was weary of Life, I had no Thought of rendering it to one I had no very kind Thoughts for: Yet I was re&s;olv'd to parly with him, and do my Endeavour to bring him to Temper; for I con&s;ider'd, he had Matter enough to gall him. But Words &s;ig|nify'd nothing; and he pre&s;s'd &s;o violently upon me, that I was oblig'd to oppo&s;e him,
<PB N="79" REF="85">
and in a little time left him dead upon the Ground.</P>
<P>I immediately got home to my Uncle's, who waited for me, and was going to chide me; but &s;eeing me look &s;o pale and confus'd, and without my Sword (for in the la&s;t Thru&s;t, that gave him his Death, he fell down to|wards me, and I let it fall out of my Hand, and his Body fell upon't) he very tenderly ask'd me the Cau&s;e of my Concern. When I had inform'd him: Well, &s;aid my Uncle, be not &s;o troubled; &s;ince you have kill'd him fairly, I'll warrant thy Pardon. But were there any Witne&s;&s;es of the Action? Se|veral, &s;aid I, on the other &s;ide of the River, tho' I know not who they were, I was in &s;o much Confu&s;ion. However, he de&s;erv'd Death, &s;aid my Uncle, for killing the un|fortunate <HI>Maria,</HI> and her innocent Infant. I did not hear what more my Uncle &s;aid, for the U&s;e of my Sen&s;es was taken from me, and I fell into a Swoon; yet, when I reco|ver'd, I found my&s;elf in Bed; for my Un|cle, imagining I had receiv'd &s;ome Wound in the Encounter, order'd a Surgeon to be brought; but when he was inform'd of the Truth, he was convinc'd that 'twas pure Grief that had overcome me, and almo&s;t
<PB N="80" REF="86">
compell'd me to be let Blood. I was in &s;uch a Condition, that De&s;pair had got the A&s;|cendant over me, and had re&s;olv'd with my|&s;elf not to live: And in order to put my De|&s;ign in Execution (being inform'd my Uncle was gone out upon &s;ome urgent Affairs) I order'd my Man to go to another Surgeon of my Acquaintance, and bring him along with him; which was quickly done. I then took an Occa&s;ion to &s;end my Servant out of the way, and de&s;ir'd the Surgeon to let me Blood in the other Arm, which he comply'd with, not knowing I had been let Blood before.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he was gone, I undid both the Bandages; the Blood pour'd out of my Veins, and I &s;oon became in&s;en&s;ible. Heaven for|give me! for I now declare I had no other Thought, but following my dear Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom it was plain, I lov'd more than Life; which that Day wou'd have put an End to, if it had not been purely for an Accident; for the la&s;t Surgeon meeting with him that fir&s;t bled me, among other Di&s;cour&s;e, told him he was going to &s;ee how I did after my Bleeding by the Order of my Uncle, who was oblig'd to go out, and that he was to &s;tay with me till his Return.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="87">The la&s;t Surgeon, in a &s;ort of Surprize, told him, he had not been long come from me, and had let me Blood; and &s;oon finding there mu&s;t be &s;ome extraordinary Meaning in my Proceeding, came both together, and broke open the Door, that I had lock'd before I let loo&s;e my Arms. I was &s;o far gone, that they gave my Uncle no Hopes of Life, which, I was inform'd, almo&s;t put him into my Condition. 'Twas two whole Days ere I open'd my Eyes; and three more before I re|cover'd my Under&s;tanding; and the Thoughts of the Cata&s;trophe of my dear <HI>Maria,</HI> had made me re&s;olve to take nothing to &s;upport Life, if I had not been prevail'd upon by my Uncle, who&s;e Sorrow quite confounded me, and a religious Man, who &s;et before me the heinous Sin of Self-Murder, a Sin he told me cou'd never be pardon'd, for it was directly flying in the Face of Heaven, without a Po&s;|&s;ibility of repenting the Action.</P>
<P>The Thoughts of Eternity made me re|pent of the Act, and re&s;olve to live. By de|grees, I recover'd my former Strength; and meeting one Day with <HI>Maria</HI>'s Maid, by Accident, I de&s;ir'd &s;he wou'd give me &s;ome Account of the melancholy Action.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="88">Sir, &s;aid &s;he, when my poor Mi&s;tre&s;s felt the Pangs and Throes of Labour upon her, &s;he wrote that Letter, and order'd me to re|turn upon the In&s;tant I had deliver'd it, for &s;he &s;hou'd want me in her unhappy Condi|tion. When I came back, I found her Pains grew wor&s;e. When I found how it was, I told her I wou'd go and &s;end for the Midwife. Do then, &s;aid &s;he; for tho' I wi&s;h for Death, the poor Innocent has done nothing to de&s;erve it; That may live to meet with a better Fate than its unhappy Mother; and in her utmo&s;t Pangs, &s;he &s;oftly utter'd your Name. The Midwife came, and &s;he was deliver'd (after great Agonies) of a fine Girl, who&s;e early Features promis'd to exceed her Mother's Beauty.</P>
<P><HI>Maria</HI>'s Mother, and the re&s;t of her Rela|tions, were in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion at what they &s;aw; for &s;eeing it a beautiful full-grown Child, they were well convinc'd the Husband was not the Father of it. The Mother came up to her, and, notwith&s;tanding her weak Condition, gave her all the ill Language &s;he cou'd think of. The poor Lady, at la&s;t faintly told her, it was her own Fault, to force her to that Marriage: That &s;he was join'd to you by Heaven: And &s;he believ'd
<PB N="83" REF="89">
&s;he had no Guilt to an&s;wer for what &s;he had done; for &s;he had ever liv'd with her Hus|band virtuou&s;ly, and ceas'd all Corre&s;pon|dence with you, &s;ince the Day of her unfor|tunate Marriage, which I witne&s;s'd for her in the Letter &s;he had wrote to you. She was brought to Bed pretty early in the Morning. Her Husband was gone to Hunt with &s;ome Gentlemen of the Country. But when he return'd, he &s;oon came to the Truth of every thing, for there was no concealing how Mat|ters went. <HI>Is is &s;o?</HI> cry'd he, all enrag'd; <HI>And am I an antedated Cuckold? I'll have no Man &s;ay I keep a Whore, or Ba&s;tard of his.</HI> Therefore, upon the In&s;tant, he flew to the Bed, fir&s;t ran his Sword into the unfortunate <HI>Maria</HI>'s Brea&s;t; and, &s;natching the lovely In|fant from the Nur&s;e's Arms, threw it again&s;t the Ground, and da&s;h'd out its innocent Brains.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time before either of us cou'd proceed in the &s;ad Narration, for Tears, at the unhappy Act. When the Maid had a little recover'd her&s;elf, &s;he proceeded.</P>
<P>The Wound the barbarous Wretch gave the unfortunate <HI>Maria,</HI> did not immediately rob her of Life; but &s;he liv'd to make all the Hearers weep at what &s;he related;
<PB N="84" REF="90">
even her unkind Mother cou'd not refrain Tears; wi&s;hing a thou&s;and times, &s;he had dy'd, before &s;he had forc'd her to that un|lucky Match. Dear Mother, reply'd the fainting Fair One, do not repine, but learn to forget Me, and this unhappy Day. Con|&s;ider, Fate is in every thing. I beg yours and Heaven's Forgivene&s;s: And then began to faint. She wou'd &s;ee the Infant, tho' in that piteous Condition: After looking upon it for &s;ome time, Poor Babe! &s;aid &s;he, thou ha&s;t &s;everely paid, tho' Innocent, for the Crime of thy Father and Mother, which I hope is forgiven by Heaven. Here &s;he began to faint again, and only &s;aid, <HI>Heaven forgive me; pre&s;erve, and &s;upport my Dear</HI> &mdash; Here her Tongue fail'd; &s;he only gave a Groan, and expir'd. We all &s;uppos'd it was your Name &s;he wou'd have utter'd, but Death &s;tept between.</P>
<P>This Relation had almo&s;t brought me to my former De&s;pair; and I often wi&s;h'd the Wretch alive once more, that had been the Cau&s;e of poor <HI>Maria</HI>'s Death, that I might have kill'd him again.</P>
<P>'Twas &s;everal Years before I cou'd wipe a|way the Thoughts of my dear <HI>Maria</HI>: Nay, I can never forget her, nor &s;eldom remember
<PB N="85" REF="91">
her without bringing Tears into my Eyes, as I have at this Repetition of my former Sorrow (for, indeed, we both cou'd not re|frain from weeping) but for her &s;ake only, I am re&s;olv'd to live and die a Batchelor, which, &s;aid he, (rea&s;&s;uming &s;ome of his for|mer Gaiety) is the better for you. Tho' my Uncle often told me, added the old Gentle|man, if he had known my Pa&s;&s;ion had been &s;o &s;trong and &s;incere, he wou'd not have been again&s;t our Marriage. Since, I have a&s;&s;um'd a freer Air, and having got acquainted in this Family, rail along with 'em, they hav|ing known nothing of my Story; for it did not make any great Noi&s;e, becau&s;e my Un|cle procur'd Witne&s;&s;es enough that heard our Di&s;cour&s;e; and the barbarous Act &s;poke &s;o much, that I was never try'd for it; which was, in &s;ome &s;ort too, prevented by my Ill|ne&s;s, and weak Condition.</P>
<P>This Story of my Uncle's, &s;eem'd to me an Introductory Hi&s;tory to my Misfortunes, which caus'd me much &s;orrowful Thinking; yet I had ever &s;ome &s;ecret Hoping, that kept up my &s;inking Spirits. When we went to Dinner, Madam, the Hou&s;ekeeper, look'd very glum upon my Uncle, tho' &s;he conti|nu'd her Civility to me, yet I took but little
<PB N="86" REF="92">
Notice of it. After Dinner, I went to Fi&s;h in a River at the bottom of the Gar|den, and in an Hour's time my Uncle came to me.</P>
<P>Hark you, young Man, &s;aid he, I have a Crow to pluck with you: What is the Rea|&s;on, good young Spark, that you have di|&s;turb'd my Hou&s;ekeeper with a Story of a Cock and a Bull, about Marriage, and I know not what, with I know not who? Why really, Sir, &s;aid I, &s;he examin'd me &s;o &s;trict|ly this Morning, that I hope you will par|don me if I tell you, I thought her imperti|nent; neither did I imagine &s;he had any Right to be angry, or pleas'd, at what I &s;aid; tho', I mu&s;t own, I &s;aw it di&s;order'd her; but I &s;uppo&s;e that only proceeded from her Intere&s;t; for if &s;he imagin'd you marry'd, you wou'd have no Occa&s;ion for a Hou&s;e|keeper; for, added I, &s;miling, my Lady wou'd take that Work off her Hands. Well, young Spark, &s;aid my Uncle, I find you are a prying young Gentleman; and &s;ince you re&s;olve to know all my Secrets, I'll declare another to you: This Woman is now and then pleas'd to Tuck me up; and, moreover, has laid a Child to me, but the Boy is &s;o unlike the reputed Father, I have no Notion I had any
<PB N="87" REF="93">
Hand in the forming him. Now this makes her a&s;&s;ume an Authority. And, to let you know further, 'tis the very Maid that liv'd with the unfortunate <HI>Maria.</HI> I thought it was my Duty to do &s;omething for her, and, at my Uncle's Death, I took her into the Hou&s;e. The Freedom I gave her in talking now and then, of that melancholy Adven|ture, grew at la&s;t into an Intimacy; Fle&s;h and Blood being frail, and different Sexes at all Hours of opportunity together, will &s;how them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, what you have entru&s;ted me with, &s;hall only teach me to pay her more Re&s;pect than I have done, without letting her know I am let into the Secret. And, for the future, I &s;hall not tell her any thing that will perplex her, upon your Account. Nay, &s;aid my Uncle, &s;miling, I &s;hall ever make her know the Difference between the Hand|maid and the Ma&s;ter: And whether her Child be mine, or not, whenever I die, I &s;hall provide hand&s;ome enough for 'em both; tho', perhaps, not according to her Expec|tation. The Boy is ignorant who his Father is, pur&s;uant to my In&s;truction to the Mo|ther; and I am apt to believe &s;he has kept it a Secret, for he is not yet of Age to be
<PB N="88" REF="94">
tru&s;ted with it; tho' the Lad is forward e|nough in every thing, but ju&s;t Learning, which makes me the more &s;u&s;pect, I am none of his Father.</P>
<P>Our Conver&s;ation has la&s;ted for Six and Twenty Years; and in Fifteen of my juve|nile Years, &s;he never pretended to make me a Father. I know &s;he has fed her&s;elf with vain Hopes, I wou'd make a Will, and put him down for Heir: But, I can a&s;&s;ure you, it never was my Intention, nor ever will be; and I &s;hall leave 'em the le&s;s for Imperti|nence. Whatever you plea&s;e, Sir, &s;aid I; but don't leave 'em the le&s;s upon my Account. Well, a few Days, an&s;wer'd my Uncle, will put an End to their Hopes, or Fears; and tho' when an Heir is &s;ettled to an E&s;tate, he looks like a Coffin to &s;ome People, yet, Youth, I don't know how to part with you to the Univer&s;ity; I am convinc'd you will have little to learn, but ill Cu&s;toms, which many Scholars imbibe, where they &s;hou'd a|void 'em: But I am not at all in pain for you; I believe the Tenets of Virtue &s;uffici|ently &s;tampt in your Mind: Therefore I have &s;ome Thoughts of riding over to your Fa|ther, to prevail upon him to let you and your Tutor live with me. I'll take care you
<PB N="89" REF="95">
&s;han't want Books; I have a good Library of my own, and if that won't do, let me but know your Wants, and they &s;hall be &s;upply'd. I gave him Thanks &s;uitable to &s;o agreeable an Offer; but hinted to him, a Per&s;on is not &s;o well e&s;teem'd in the World with|out a Univer&s;ity-Education. That's but a &s;mall Con&s;ideration, reply'd my Uncle, and if we meet with no other Difficulties, I hope we &s;hall get over that.</P>
<P>From this Subject, we proceeded to that of the Widow's Family. I believe, Sir, &s;aid I, <HI>I&s;abella</HI> is, and will be, as aver&s;e to Mar|riage (at lea&s;t by her Di&s;cour&s;e) as her Mo|ther, or Aunt. I fan&s;y, young Man, re|ply'd my Uncle, you begin to fear it. Come, come, continue your Corre&s;pondence; there's a great deal in the fir&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion, and Na|ture will prevail. But enough of this; I'll now &s;hew you my Library, which you have not yet &s;een; and give you the Key, that you may make u&s;e of it when you plea&s;e; but, added he, if you u&s;e it too much, I'll take it from you again.</P>
<P>When we came into the Library, which was a &s;pacious Room built on purpo&s;e, I was &s;urpriz'd to find it &s;o well &s;tor'd with &s;uch Variety, and valuable Books, e&s;pecially
<PB N="90" REF="96">
all the Cla&s;&s;ics of the be&s;t Editions. I told my Uncle, I lik'd my Situation &s;o well, that if he wou'd give me Leave, I wou'd employ my&s;elf a few Hours to look 'em over. That was one Rea&s;on why I brought you here now, reply'd my Uncle, for I am oblig'd to go for &s;ome Hours upon &s;ome urgent Af|fairs; and imagining I &s;hou'd bring you in|to Company you wou'd like, made me the more willing to introduce you to 'em, and if you find your&s;elf tir'd, and their Conver&s;a|tion &s;hou'd not plea&s;e you, they won't be di&s;|oblig'd at your leaving 'em. So &s;aying, he gave me the Key, and &s;hut me in. While I was in high Delight, for I had even for|got the fair <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I heard Whi&s;pering in the next Clo&s;et, which made me awake from my plea&s;ing Amu&s;ement; and in a little time I cou'd hear the good Hou&s;ekeeper &s;ay, You may &s;peak louder, for I am a&s;&s;ur'd there's no one within hearing, for the old Gentle|man's gone out. Ay, but, reply'd the Man's Voice, What's become of the young One? Gone with him to be &s;ure, return'd the Hou&s;e|keeper, for he does not &s;tir a Foot without him, and therefore let us make good U&s;e of our Time, for I fear our Meetings will be le&s;s frequent. I am convinc'd this young
<PB N="91" REF="97">
Gentleman will be a Thorn in our Side, for when he and his Uncle were together the Day that he came, I heard him inform him, that he wou'd make his Will &s;hortly, and put him down his Heir. Now, as you, no doubt, are to draw the Writings, I wou'd have you find &s;ome Means to provide for our Child, which he imagines to be his. That, I think, will be impo&s;&s;ible, an&s;wer'd the Man; for, be a&s;&s;ur'd he will read it over before he Signs it; or if he does not do it then, he may at &s;ome other Time. No, no, that will never do. We mu&s;t e'en wait with Patience till his Death, and I'll find it ea&s;y enough to make a Will for our Advantage, of a later Date than what he intends to make. I own, &s;aid the Hou&s;ekeeper, it goes again&s;t me to think of defrauding the young Gentle|man. But when you con&s;ider, reply'd the Man, you do it for your own Fle&s;h and Blood, you ought to have no Scruple. Well, return'd the Hou&s;ekeeper, I mu&s;t leave the whole Affair to you. I &s;hou'd be contented to &s;hare the E&s;tate between the two Boys; and I think, if he does otherwi&s;e, as he ima|gines our Child his, he will not do Ju&s;tice. We &s;hall &s;ee what he intends to do, when he makes his Will, reply'd the Man, and, in
<PB N="92" REF="98">
&s;hort, till then, we can't make a Judgment on any one thing.</P>
<P>I found, afterwards, they had left &s;peak|ing aloud, and were making them&s;elves as merry as they cou'd. They were &s;o boi&s;te|rous, that &s;everal Folios I had lean'd again&s;t the Wain&s;cot, tumbled down, which alarm'd 'em very much. Ble&s;s me! cry'd <HI>For&s;ooth,</HI> What's that? I can't tell, return'd the Man; I hope the Squire is not in his Study. No, that I am &s;ure of, &s;aid the Hou&s;ekeeper. Now I recollect my&s;elf, continu'd &s;he, 'tis &s;ome of the Books tumbled off the Shelves. They made them&s;elves ea&s;y with that Suppo|&s;ition, and continu'd their Game. After &s;ome time, I cou'd hear 'em go &s;oftly down Stairs. I waited at the Window &s;ome time, and at la&s;t &s;aw him go thro' the Court-yard. He was a tall thin Man, had a Ca&s;t of an Eye, and &s;eem'd about Forty.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I found all was &s;till, I went &s;oft|ly out of the Library, and went into my own Room, a pair of Stairs higher, to avoid all Su&s;picion. When I was there, I re&s;olv'd to acquaint my Uncle with the whole Truth; for I thought it wou'd be Inju&s;tice to conceal it, if it had not concern'd my&s;elf. When my Uncle came in, he was in a very good
<PB N="93" REF="99">
Humour, and wou'd often &s;mile at his own Imagination. I told him, it was a great Pity he &s;hou'd &s;tay at home as he u&s;ually did, if going abroad made him &s;o merry. <HI>Billy,</HI> reply'd my Uncle, I have &s;o much Rea&s;on to be merry, at lea&s;t in my own Opinion, that I'll tell you the Cau&s;e of my Mirth; and I have &s;o good a Regard for your Under|&s;tanding, that I'll rule my Ri&s;ibility, for this once, by it; and if you declare I am in the wrong to be merry, I'll do my Endeavour to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid I, if that is the only Rea&s;on in letting me into the Secret of your Mirth, you need not give your&s;elf that Trouble, for I am apt to believe, you will be right in every thing you do. No Compliments, Boy, re|ply'd my Uncle; I have told you before, I don't like 'em. But to proceed.</P>
<P>You remember that Gentleman we brought in the Coach from the Widow's, ye&s;terday. That Gentleman is about Five and Thirty: Three Years ago, he was one of the mo&s;t eminent Merchants upon the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and his Credit wou'd have &s;tretch'd as far as the be&s;t of 'em.</P>
<P>In the Time, of his Pro&s;perity, he fell in Love with a Widow-Lady of a va&s;t For|tune,
<PB N="94" REF="100">
without the Incumbrances of Children upon't. The Lady gave him all the Encou|ragement he cou'd expect. The Day of their E&s;pou&s;als was fix'd, and near approaching, when the uncomfortable News was brought him, of the Lo&s;s of almo&s;t all his Fortune; for three of his riche&s;t Ve&s;&s;els were taken by Pirates. This, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, was a very great Shock to him; but being a Per|&s;on of the utmo&s;t Philo&s;ophy, he calmly re|&s;ign'd him&s;elf to the Will of Heaven. He immediately left off Trade; and when his Debts were paid, he that was but ten Days before, in every Body's Opinion, worth a Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds, found him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of Seventy Pounds a Year, and his Country Hou&s;e, which he in&s;tantly &s;old, and, as I thought it a good Bargain, I became the Purcha&s;er. His greate&s;t Satisfaction in his Misfortunes, was the Thoughts of the Wi|dow's proving con&s;tant to him; and he did not doubt, but with her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to reco|ver his Lo&s;&s;es. But few Women, my Boy, are &s;incere in their Prote&s;tations. 'Tis true, &s;ometimes the blind Spark &s;tings 'em in the Tail, that they become as blind as Fortune; or otherwi&s;e they are as hard to deal with, as a Par&s;on for his Tithes.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="101">The Gentleman, after his Misfortunes, I can with Ju&s;tice declare, was more welcome to me than before; for it wou'd be a Hard|&s;hip indeed to have the Unfortunate &s;lighted; and I am a&s;&s;ur'd that generous Minds re&s;ent things that are offer'd 'em in their Adver&s;ity, that they wou'd not have regarded in their Pro&s;perity. One Morning, at Breakfa&s;t, I ob&s;erv'd him very melancholy, in&s;omuch that he refus'd his Chocolate; I encourag'd him as much as I cou'd, as imagining the Thoughts of his Lo&s;&s;es had attack'd him. But I was very much &s;urpriz'd to hear him &s;ay, his former Lo&s;&s;es were nothing to what then oppre&s;s'd him. I mu&s;t own, &s;aid he, I had &s;ome Omens of it Ye&s;terday; for when I went to vi&s;it the Widow, as u&s;ual, I was told, &s;he was not at home; but returning by the Garden-Wall, I heard her talking to her Maid; and when I call'd to her, cou'd get no An&s;wer. This Morning my Su&s;picions are confirm'd, for &s;he has ju&s;t now &s;ent me a Letter, where &s;he tells me, <HI>She is very much grieved at my Lo&s;&s;es; and as Merchandizing is &s;o very precarious, &s;he hopes I will pardon her if &s;he intends to keep her For|tune to her&s;elf; and endeavour to mend my Cre|dit with &s;omebody el&s;e.</HI> The Lo&s;s of her Mo|ney
<PB N="96" REF="102">
does not vex me half &s;o much, as her in|&s;ulting me; and tho', I mu&s;t own, I have a very great Regard for her Per&s;on, yet I wou'd not wed her now, if &s;he &s;hou'd repent of her U&s;age.</P>
<P>I believe there's little Danger of that, &s;aid I. Women have Ob&s;tinacy enough to keep bad Re&s;olutions. All I cou'd &s;ay to him, gave him but little Comfort; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, his Unea&s;ine&s;s infected me. But, as I have told you, Time is an excellent Doctor, for the almo&s;t bald Gentleman wrought a Cure, &s;o that he often wi&s;h'd it in his Power to be reveng'd on the Widow.</P>
<P>Many Weeks pa&s;s'd on, and his Inclina|tion &s;trengthen'd, tho' no Accident cou'd a&s;|&s;i&s;t him, till about two Months ago, an old Barn that belong'd to the Hou&s;e, I order'd to be pull'd down, with an Intention to make an Addition to my Garden; for I had &s;ome Overtures made me by a Nobleman, concern|ing a Purcha&s;e, in which I &s;hou'd make a con&s;iderable Profit, tho' with a &s;ecret Inten|tion to give it to the Gentleman I had bought it of. The Barn, in reality, did &s;till belong to him, for it &s;erv'd a Farm near the Hou&s;e I had bought, which was the Remainder of the Gen|tleman's E&s;tate, and the &s;ame he liv'd in.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="103">In digging the Earth of the Foundation, there was found a Pot of Money that contain'd up|wards of a Hundred Pound, which was gi|ven the Gentleman. As we were at Supper, and pretty merry at the Accident, an odd Thought came into my Head. Why may we not, &s;aid I, to the Gentleman, report, we have found a larger Sum? No one knows what we have found, but the Man that dug it up, and we can in&s;truct him to favour the Deceit. But to what End, return'd the Gen|tleman? Why, to be reveng'd on the Wi|dow, &s;aid I. I am a&s;&s;ur'd 'twas covetous In|tere&s;t at fir&s;t made her comply with your Addre&s;&s;es; and when once &s;he finds it her Intere&s;t, &s;he'll receive 'em willingly again; and if we can bring Matters about, to com|pleat your Revenge, you mu&s;t e'en marry her. The Gentleman &s;mil'd at my Project, but thought it wou'd be impo&s;&s;ible to bring it to any thing. Well, &s;aid I, you &s;hall have little to do; I warrant, I'll make your Part ea|&s;y enough. Accordingly, I went to work. We reported about the Country, that &s;uch a Gen|tleman had found a va&s;t Trea&s;ure in his Barn, &s;uppos'd to be hid there in the Civil Wars, even enough to recompen&s;e all his Lo&s;&s;es. The Fellow that dug up the Money, was an
<PB N="98" REF="104">
arch Rogue, one fit for our De&s;ign; I took care to in&s;truct him; and, to carry every thing on with a good Face, as I want|ed a Coach, I bought a new one, &s;ent the Gentleman to his Hou&s;e again, as if he had made a new Purcha&s;e of it, in the new Coach, and Attendance &s;uitable. I al&s;o let the Si&s;ter to <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Mother into the Secret, who, by her Contrivance, receiv'd the Addre&s;&s;es of the Gentleman. You mu&s;t imagine, this &s;ur|priz'd every Body, and &s;oon came to the fickle Widow's Ear: She, it &s;eems, began to be very inqui&s;itive, had &s;ent for the Fellow that dug the Money up, and examin'd him. He afterwards came and inform'd us what pa&s;s'd between 'em. I was very much pleas'd to hear it; and we in&s;tructed him how he &s;hou'd behave to her. We order'd him to let her know, that we were to meet to &s;ettle our Matters at a neighbouring Tavern in the Town, and &s;everal People, along with the fortunate Squire.</P>
<P>When the Fellow came back from her, we took him into Examination again. As &s;oon as I came before her (&s;aid the Fellow) &s;he ask'd me, if I was the Man that had found the Money. Yes, Madam, &s;aid I. Well, and is it as much as the World reports? Re|ally,
<PB N="99" REF="105">
I can't tell, for&s;ooth, &s;aid I. There was &s;ixteen great Pots, that wou'd hold about a Gallon a-piece; and in one of 'em there was abundance of &s;uch Stuff as your Lady&s;hip has about your Neck, for&s;ooth, and in your Ears; I can't tell what they are good for, not I; but they &s;ay they are worth Twenty Thou|&s;and Pounds. Well but, &s;aid the Lady to him, do you know what was in the Pots? Why, in nine Pots, for&s;ooth, &s;aid I, there was nothing but Pieces of old Gold; and the re&s;t had all Silver in 'em. But I did &s;ay, Sir, I thought it was too good for you, for you gave me but Ten Pounds in old <HI>Jacobus's</HI> for my Hone&s;ty; for you know, Madam, &s;aid I, I cou'd have &s;ecur'd a Pot or two for my|&s;elf. But when I told her you were to meet at the Tavern, &s;he gave me a Crown, and &s;aid &s;he wou'd give me another, if I cou'd find means to bring her into the next Room to where you were. I am to bring her Word to-morrow, when you are all met, and &s;he'll be ready to come with me.</P>
<P>Well, what &s;ay you now? &s;aid I, to the Gentleman; our Plot begins to thicken. Why indeed, he reply'd, I begin to conceive &s;ome Hopes of it. We gave the Fellow his In&s;tructions; and I told him, I wou'd make
<PB N="100" REF="106">
one of his Lyes a Truth, if we &s;ucceeded, and that &s;hou'd be the Ten Pounds. He gave us good A&s;&s;urance, that he wou'd not fail in his Part.</P>
<P>The next Day we met at the Place ap|pointed, with Gentlemen that we had let into the Secret; and, among the re&s;t, one to re|pre&s;ent a Lawyer; for we did not much care to tru&s;t a real One, there is &s;o little Hone&s;ty among 'em. The Fellow was to give Notice when the Widow was come, by &s;hutting a Ca&s;ement in the Room where &s;he was to be; for it was an old-fa&s;hion'd Window, and made Noi&s;e enough in the Shutting to be heard all over the Hou&s;e. We at la&s;t heard the Signal to begin our Farce. I had provided a great Number of old Writings and Papers, that if &s;he &s;hou'd have the Curio&s;ity to peep, &s;he might perceive we had all our Implements. One of our Company told our Gentleman, the mo&s;t that cou'd be made of his Jewels, was Eighteen Thou&s;and Five Hundred Pounds. Another cry'd, There's your Bills for the Forty Thou&s;and Pounds from the Gold&s;miths. And there's the Five Thou|&s;and Bank Notes; but, added he, the Tel|lers were &s;urpriz'd! they had not &s;een &s;o ma|ny Pieces of old Gold in their Lives, nei|ther
<PB N="101" REF="107">
wou'd they accept 'em, but by Weight. It can't be help'd, cry'd our Gentleman, they will have a good Profit by it, for I &s;uppo&s;e it will all be paid out to the full Currency.</P>
<P>Every body play'd their Parts to Admira|tion. And when our Bu&s;ine&s;s was over, we &s;at in to Drinking, with many Healths to the Gentleman, as Top of our Company. We had not been at it long, ere our Emi&s;&s;a|ry came in, who told us, Madam had got Intelligence enough, he believ'd; for after we were &s;et in to Drinking, &s;he pre&s;ently re|tir'd, fir&s;t giving me a Guinea, as a golden Key to lock up my Tongue; which I pro|mis'd her faithfully to perform; and, Ma|&s;ters, you may perceive, I intend to keep my Word. We &s;pent the re&s;t of the Evening with good Wine (tho' at a Tavern) and the Hopes of &s;ucceeding in our De&s;ign.</P>
<P>The next Morning we found it began to work; for this Letter (pulling one out of his Pocket) came from the Widow to the Gentleman.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> AM &s;urpriz'd I have neither &s;een or heard from you the&s;e three Months. I expected an An&s;wer from a Letter I &s;ent you out of a Joke,
<PB N="102" REF="108">
to &s;ee how you wou'd re&s;ent a Refu&s;al. But that Pa&s;&s;ion is not very &s;trong, to be thrown down at a &s;eeming Denial. I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you, which is not altogether &s;o proper to commit to Writing; but if you'll take the Trouble to come our Way, I can inform you of a Per&s;on that wou'd be glad to &s;ee you.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours to command, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Why now, Friend, &s;aid I, &s;he begins to nibble, and it's your own Fault if you don't catch her; I'll engage &s;he takes the Bait, if you'll be but careful in playing her. Why, what wou'd you have me to do, &s;aid the Gentleman? Do! &s;aid I; do as you &s;hou'd do; marry her, for you can't be &s;ufficiently reveng'd without it. I can't do that, he re|ply'd, that will be too full-grown a Cheat; you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that Station la&s;ts for Life, and to have all my Hours imbitter'd with Upbraidings, wou'd prove a Hell upon Earth. Why, &s;aid I, the World will but laugh at the Trick; I mean, tho&s;e that know it; and for tho&s;e that don't know the Arti|fice we have us'd, they will have the better Regard for your Wife. Be&s;ides, when &s;he finds the Impo&s;ition, her Under&s;tanding will make her quiet; for my Part, I think it will be a fit|ting
<PB N="103" REF="109">
Puni&s;hment: Be&s;ides, I am a&s;&s;ur'd &s;he mu&s;t have &s;ome Inclination for you, or &s;he wou'd not have accepted your fir&s;t Addre&s;&s;es; but that her Avarice prov'd too weighty for her Love. This ought to reconcile you to the De&s;ign. If you have any Regard for her, you'll &s;oon find means to make all even; and if you've none, your Con&s;cience will not long trouble you. I'll a&s;&s;ure you, if I thought there was the lea&s;t Guilt in't, I wou'd not have any Hand in't: Be&s;ides, in the long Run, &s;he may not prove a Lo&s;er; Fortune has fair Looks, as well as Frowns, and her Ill Humour may be worn out. The Con&s;i|deration of that, &s;aid he, has wip'd away all Scruples, and I'll venture thro' all Dangers. In &s;hort, he made his Vi&s;it, and in all his Di&s;cour&s;e hinted, that the Report of finding &s;o much Wealth was fal&s;e; and told her the Truth, in hopes not to be believ'd. To cut my Story &s;hort, he once more gain'd her Con&s;ent; and this Evening they were marry'd. Now this is the great Bu&s;ine&s;s I have been about. What makes me &s;mile, is, the Lady's mighty Inclination to live in the Hou&s;e where the Money was found, imagin|ing there were more Mines of Wealth to be work'd out yet. To-morrow I intend to vi|&s;it
<PB N="104" REF="110">
'em, and let her know the whole Truth of the Matter, which I did not care to do till after Con&s;ummation. And now, conti|nu'd my Uncle, I have let you into the Se|cret of my Mirth, tho' it is impo&s;&s;ible to in|form you of all the merry Circum&s;tances. I wi&s;h, &s;aid I, Sir, your Puni&s;hment is not too &s;evere for the poor Woman. I warrant you, &s;aid my Uncle, &s;he'll &s;oon forget her Re&s;ent|ment. A Ble&s;&s;ing, you know, <HI>Billy,</HI> mu&s;t al|ways follow Wedlock. I wi&s;h it may, Sir, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>Our Di&s;cour&s;e was interrupted by a loud Ringing at the Door. We all ran to the Win|dow to &s;ee who it was in &s;uch Ha&s;te; and &s;aw a Per&s;on at the Door, with his Hor&s;e all in a Foam, enquiring for Squire <HI>Bridgford,</HI> which was the Name of the Gentleman who was marry'd that Evening. The Wedding being a Secret, my Uncle told him he would not be in Town till the Morning. He &s;eem'd very unea&s;y; which my Uncle perceiving, began to enquire into his Concern. Sir, &s;aid the Man, I bring him welcome News, and the &s;ooner he knows it, the &s;ooner I &s;hall be ea&s;y. He was invited in, and his Hor&s;e ta|ken care of. The Per&s;on told my Uncle, he had brought the Squire News of above Forty
<PB N="105" REF="111">
Thou&s;and Pounds. That's News indeed! reply'd my Uncle, and welcome, if it be true. It's true, by G&mdash;d! &s;aid the Per&s;on, being a blunt Sailor; for I am an Eye-Wit|ne&s;s of it. After the Man was refre&s;h'd, he told my Uncle, that one of his Ships had made her E&s;cape from the Pirates. We were all taken, &s;aid the Tar, near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ma|labar,</HI> by <HI>French</HI> Pirates, who us'd tho&s;e Men that refus'd to make Part of their Crew, vile|ly; &s;ome they cut their No&s;es off, &s;ome their Ears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which the major Part con&s;idering, re&s;olv'd to &s;eem to comply, 'till a fitter Op|portunity &s;hou'd offer, to get out of their Clutches. I under&s;tanding a little <HI>French,</HI> was their Spoke&s;man; I told 'em, we did not comply out of the Fear of Puni&s;hment, but that it was what we all cho&s;e. Many of us had, a long time before, Thoughts of run|ning away with the Ship. They receiv'd us very kindly, gave us good U&s;age, and tho&s;e that did not come into their Mea&s;ures, were not only tortur'd, as I &s;aid before, but put under Confinement in Fetters. We took an Opportunity to inform the poor Wretches of our Intention, which made 'em repent they had not thought of the &s;ame Method: Mo&s;t of 'em, hoping for better U&s;age, begg'd to
<PB N="106" REF="112">
be admitted; but the wily <HI>Frenchman</HI> utterly deny'd 'em, well knowing they wou'd not be true Pirates.</P>
<P>They carry'd all their Prizes to their Ren|dezvous, into a Bay upon the I&s;land of <HI>Ma|daga&s;car,</HI> where we had the Liberty to go on Shore, and con&s;ort among their Helli&s;h Crew. We fitted out again, and took &s;everal <HI>Chine&s;e Joncks,</HI> richly laden, and in every En|gagement behav'd &s;o well, that the Captain of the Pirates &s;et very much by us. When we came back to our Rendezvous, there was &s;ome Di&s;turbance among 'em, concerning &s;ome former Shares; but we thought it was all hu&s;h'd. They had loaded one of the larg|e&s;t Ships that was taken from us, with Goods out of the other Two, in order to go and trade with the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Batavia</HI>; and one Night, Seventy of the di&s;contented Party got in her, cut &s;ome that were on Board in Pie|ces, &s;lip'd their Anchors, and &s;tole away in the Night. The next Morning, the Cap|tain was out of his Wits, and the re&s;t of the Men were as mad as him&s;elf. But, in &s;hort, the whole Fleet, which con&s;i&s;ted of four &s;tout Ships, were &s;ent after 'em different Ways.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="113">We &s;teer'd <HI>N. N. W.</HI> three Days, and on the fourth di&s;cover'd a Sail; we crouded all we cou'd to come up with her, and &s;oon per|ceiv'd 'twas She we wanted. While they were bu&s;ied in getting ready to engage, I &s;tole down into the Powder-Room, which I had the Care of, open'd all the Barrels, and pour'd Water into mo&s;t of 'em, and with the re&s;t I mix'd &s;ome of the Balla&s;t of the Ship.</P>
<P>When we came up with 'em, a de&s;perate Fight en&s;u'd, as long as the good Powder la&s;ted; then I ran up to the Captain, call'd him into the Cabbin, where I told him, in a &s;eeming Confu&s;ion, I was certain &s;ome of the Men were in the Intere&s;t of the other Ship. I then inform'd him what was done to the Pow|der. The Captain ask'd me, What was to be done? Board 'em, Sir, &s;aid I, and fight 'em Sword in Hand. What &s;hall I do? &s;aid he. There's no tru&s;ting our own Men. Why, &s;aid I, there's &s;ixty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of us, I'll en|gage we &s;hall &s;oon overcome 'em. I wou'd have you, reply'd the Captain, inform 'em of it, and tell them they &s;hall be well re|warded.</P>
<P>We bore off a little, while we were con|&s;ulting, for we cou'd overtake the other Ship when we wou'd, becau&s;e &s;he was heavy-laden.
<PB N="108" REF="114">
I acquainted all my Ship-Mates with the Re&s;olution I had taken, and they, one and all came into it. When we had con&s;ult|ed proper Mea&s;ures, we bore after 'em again. I inform'd the Captain, when we had over|come the other Ship, I wou'd put him in a Way to find out the Knaves that had plaid him that Trick. He thank'd me, and away we went to work. We boarded her upon the Starboard-Quarter, enter'd her Pellmell, and &s;oon cut to Pieces tho&s;e that made Re|&s;i&s;tance, with the Lo&s;s of Seven <HI>Frenchmen</HI> and One <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI>; for we had Fifteen <HI>French</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. Six and Twenty of our Oppo&s;ers call'd for <HI>Quarter,</HI> but it was not granted, before the inveterate <HI>Frenchmen</HI> had knock'd in the Head Nine of 'em. Five more were &s;o wounded, it was thought they cou'd not live, which &s;till an&s;wer'd my Pur|po&s;e. The others were clap'd under Hatches, and a Guard put over them.</P>
<P>The next Day, the Captain put me in mind of my Promi&s;e, to find out the Guilty. Sir, &s;aid I, call all the Men upon the Quarter-Deck; all I put on the Larboard-Side, Or|der to be &s;eiz'd, and clap'd under Hatches; you may tax 'em with their Crime when they are &s;ecur'd; tho' they deny it, I'll prove
<PB N="109" REF="115">
what I &s;ay upon every one of 'em before Night. My Advice was follow'd; the Men were call'd up, to the Number of Sixty Eight, Forty One I plac'd on the Larboard-Side, of tho&s;e Men that were out of the Captain's Sight during the Engagement, tho' doing their Duty. The other Twenty Seven were on the Starboard. The Men on both Sides, cou'd not imagine the Meaning of this Divi|&s;ion. All the <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> were upon the main Deck; and, by &s;ome Means or other, accord|ing to my Directions, had their Arms about 'em; tho&s;e that cou'd not conceal 'em, made as if they were cleaning 'em. The Captain told tho&s;e on the Larboard-Side, they were &s;u&s;pected to be in the Confederacy with the Runaways, therefore, he wou'd not have 'em take it ill, if they were confin'd till their Guilt, or Innocence, were made to appear.</P>
<P>They were all amaz'd at the Captain's Speech, which he took for the Signs of Guilt. Some were refractory; but at la&s;t, they con|&s;ented to be confin'd, well knowing their In|nocence. They were put under Hatches ac|cordingly. As they were going down, the Captain &s;aid, the Innocent &s;hall be rewarded. When they were below, a Guard was &s;et up|on 'em, and I had taken care to have all their Arms &s;ecur'd.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="116">The Captain then told the Starboard-Side Men the whole Story, and that it was by my Advice and Conduct the Ship was taken, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Men were &s;urpriz'd, to be &s;ure. It was plea&s;ant to hear their Di&s;cour&s;e; they found 'em Guilty: I always thought there was &s;omething in the Wind, in &s;uch a Me&s;s, &s;ays one; &s;ays another, I even heard &s;omething of their De&s;ign la&s;t Night, but as I was not &s;ure, I did not care to &s;peak on't; nay, &s;ays another, I believe <HI>Jaques</HI> &s;uch-a-one had a great mind to corrupt me, for he follow'd me every where Ye&s;terday, and only wanted an Opportunity of breaking his Mind to me. In &s;hort, mo&s;t of 'em had &s;omething to &s;ay, and all to prove 'em guilty. It was Matter &s;ufficient for our Mirth afterwards, but I was a little too much concern'd to laugh then.</P>
<P>The remaining <HI>Frenchmen</HI> were got into Ca|bals by Fives and Sixes all over the Deck; and our <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> were impatiently expect|ing the Word of Command to &s;eize 'em.</P>
<P>When we had proceeded thus far, I told the Captain, if he wou'd plea&s;e to go into the great Cabbin, I wou'd convince him how he &s;hou'd prove 'em. When we two were there by our&s;elves, I took a Pi&s;tol out of my
<PB N="111" REF="117">
Pocket, and told him, I was the Man that had damag'd his Powder, in order to bring that to pa&s;s, which was happily effected. I let him know, I had gone too far not to take his Life, if he re&s;i&s;ted, or call'd out; and inform'd him, it wou'd &s;ignify nothing if he did, for I had two Signals to my Countrymen, one to &s;eize his Men, and do 'em no further Hurt, and the other to kill 'em all immedi|ately. And I farther added, Not one of 'em &s;hou'd &s;uffer, if they wou'd be quiet; and that we only contriv'd this Stratagem to gain our Liberty.</P>
<P>The Captain thank'd me, and told me he cou'd not blame me for what I had done; but wonder'd at him&s;elf that he &s;hou'd be im|pos'd upon in &s;uch a manner. He &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to be ty'd very patiently.</P>
<P>When I had done, I went upon the Deck, and gave the Word, <HI>Now,</HI> which was to &s;eize 'em only; the other was, <HI>Now do your Work</HI>; tho' I did not intend to u&s;e tho&s;e Words, except I had found Re&s;i&s;tance. Up|on the Word, the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> were all &s;eiz'd. It's impo&s;&s;ible to tell their A&s;toni&s;hment; but their Surprize was heighten'd, when I brought out their Captain, bound, who &s;oon let 'em into the whole Matter. They were all &s;truck
<PB N="112" REF="118">
dumb for &s;ome time, and then fell a gab|bling out their <HI>Mort de ma vie,</HI> like &s;o many di&s;turb'd Gee&s;e. But tho' their Tongues were at Liberty, we did 'em the Favour to bind 'em all by the Hands. Some of our Men whom the others had releas'd (tho&s;e, I mean, that were ill us'd for not con&s;enting to turn Pirates, who, by good Fortune, were all in our Ship, tho' in the <HI>Frenchmen's</HI> Reign, did all the &s;ervile Offices of the Ve&s;&s;el) were for cutting to Pieces tho&s;e that were in&s;tru|mental in their ill U&s;age; but as they gave me the Command, I order'd, not one &s;hou'd be touch'd, which the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> thank'd me for.</P>
<P>The One and Forty below &s;oon found what we were at, and we as &s;oon prevail'd upon 'em to be ty'd to their good Behaviour. When we had &s;ecur'd 'em all in the Steer|age and Great Cabbin, and order'd Centries, with a great Gun charg'd with Mu&s;quet-Ball to fire in upon 'em, if they &s;eem'd to make any Re&s;i&s;tance, we went on Board our Prize, and took care of the other ten <HI>Frenchmen</HI> that were &s;et on as a Guard to the Thieves, as the re&s;t call'd 'em, as if <HI>they</HI> were none. We carry'd 'em all on Board. When every thing was quiet, we directed our Cour&s;e for <HI>Eng|land</HI>;
<PB N="113" REF="119">
and in two Days more, we took every thing out of the Pirate that wou'd be u&s;eful to us in our Voyage, leaving 'em a Month's Provi&s;ion. We &s;ecur'd all their Arms and Ammunition, and cut &s;ome of their Rigging, leaving 'em only a Fore&s;ail, with a Main Top&s;ail, to prevent their getting into Har|bour too &s;oon for us, and cau&s;e us to be pur&s;u'd.</P>
<P>Thus every thing being order'd, as we hop'd, for the be&s;t, we <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> went on Board our own Ship, and left them to &s;teer their Cour&s;e back to <HI>Pirates Harbour,</HI> as we call'd it. We continu'd our Voyage to <HI>England,</HI> where we happily arriv'd, meeting nothing to mole&s;t us all the way.</P>
<P>We were mightily pleas'd with his <HI>Nar|rative,</HI> and highly commended his Under|taking and Re&s;olution. Said my Uncle, Mr. <HI>Bridgford</HI> is oblig'd to you for his good Fortune; and I doubt not but he will reward you accordingly. He told us, he was a Re|lation of Mr. <HI>Bridgford</HI>'s, and Mate of the Ship, the Captain dying when he was in the <HI>Pirates</HI> Hands; and all he de&s;ir'd was, only to make his Promi&s;e good to the Sailors, which was, to allow 'em double Wages for the whole Voyage. My Uncle told him, he
<PB N="114" REF="120">
wou'd a&s;&s;ure him of that. After a little Conver&s;ation and Repa&s;t, the <HI>Me&s;&s;enger</HI> was &s;ent to Re&s;t, for he had come &s;ixty Miles that Day, upon one Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>When he was gone, we cou'd not but ad|mire at his Conduct in the Affair, and the Providence of God to Mr. <HI>Bridgford.</HI> This good Fortune, &s;aid my Uncle, will be a great Means of bringing on a Reconcilement. Now you &s;ee, Sir, &s;aid I, there is a Ble&s;&s;ing attends the Marriage-State. Yes, &s;aid my Uncle, but nothing to provoke me to enter into the Noo&s;e. It mu&s;t bring &s;ome Cares along with it, be the Comforts ever &s;o ma|ny. I fan&s;y, Sir, &s;aid I, there's Cares at|tend your pre&s;ent Way of Living. It may be &s;o, &s;aid my Uncle, but none that I am ty'd to bear.</P>
<P>I finding a fit Opportunity, thought it a pro|per Time to inform him of what I had heard in the <HI>Library</HI>; but conjur'd him not to take any Notice of it, 'till we cou'd find an Oc|ca&s;ion of his being an Ear-Witne&s;s. Well then, &s;aid my Uncle, I'll take your Advice, and let it re&s;t 'till after my Friend <HI>Bridgford</HI>'s Affair is over, and then we'll contrive &s;ome Way or other to catch 'em in their own Snares.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="121">The next Morning, my Uncle took me a|long with him, to wait upon the new-mar|ry'd Couple, and the <HI>Sailor</HI> with us. We gave him In&s;tructions to wait till we call'd for him. When we came to the Lady's Hou&s;e, we were u&s;her'd up into the Bed-Chamber, where we found the Bride in Tears; for tho' it was agreed not to open the Affair till my Uncle came, yet the Husband cou'd not be ea&s;y till he had told her all. She took it ve|ry heinou&s;ly at fir&s;t; but, weighing every thing well, &s;he had only Recour&s;e to her Tears, which &s;he wip'd away as &s;oon as &s;he perceiv'd us.</P>
<P>Come, Sir, &s;aid &s;he to my Uncle, I can now forgive your <HI>Plot</HI> upon me; tho' I mu&s;t own, the Di&s;appointment caus'd me much Unea&s;ine&s;s; yet I find what is appointed by Heaven, mu&s;t be; I am &s;atisfy'd we have enough, and I begin already to loath my for|mer Temper. Why now, Madam, &s;aid my Uncle, you &s;trike a true Harmony, and, to indulge it, I have brought you a Pre&s;ent; one mu&s;t never come empty-handed to a new-marry'd Pair, <HI>Billy,</HI> continu'd my Uncle, call in the Man. When he came in, Mr. <HI>Bridgford</HI> was &s;urpriz'd: Cou&s;in <HI>Brooks!</HI> &s;aid he, I am very much pleas'd to &s;ee you;
<PB N="116" REF="122">
and this is a very acceptable Pre&s;ent, for I thought you in the Hands of <HI>Pirates.</HI> Pray how got you from them? Why, to bring home to you the good Ship <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> re|ply'd Mr. <HI>Brooks.</HI> We then let him into the whole Story, and he bore his <HI>Joy,</HI> as he did his <HI>Grief,</HI> with a Serenity of Temper he was (as my Uncle &s;aid) always Ma&s;ter of. I am pleas'd with this Pre&s;ent from a Fortune, Ma|dam, &s;aid he, only that it may be a Means to make you forget &s;ome Part of your Lo&s;s in your Chimerical One. She made him a &s;uitable Reply, and all pa&s;t Actions were &s;oon forgot.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bridgford</HI> gave his Cou&s;in <HI>Brooks</HI> a Ring off his Finger, with a Promi&s;e of a Thou&s;and Pounds, and to make him <HI>Captain</HI> of the Ship he had &s;o worthily &s;av'd. But, my Dear, &s;aid the Lady, you give the Gen|tleman a Pre&s;ent, which I &s;uppo&s;e he is not to di&s;po&s;e of, but never con&s;ider he has been in the Hands of <HI>Pirates,</HI> and perhaps all his Ready-Money's gone; and, added &s;he, &s;mi|ling, you have not receiv'd the Money for your Jewels yet, therefore I mu&s;t do &s;ome|thing for you; with that &s;he went out, and immediately return'd with a hundred Guineas, which &s;he gave to Mr. <HI>Brooks</HI>; there, Sir,
<PB N="117" REF="123">
&s;aid &s;he, that's &s;omething better than Pro|mi&s;es; however, it's only as Earne&s;t, my Husband &s;hall keep his Word.</P>
<P>We finding her in &s;o good a Humour, took our Leaves: She much intreated us to &s;tay Dinner, but my Uncle told her, her Husband's old Sweetheart was to dine with him, who long'd to hear how Matters went. What, more Confederates? return'd the Lady; but I forgive all, and thank you for tricking me into my Happine&s;s.</P>
<P>As we were going home, my Uncle told me he was very well pleas'd he had been in|&s;trumental in converting <HI>one</HI> Woman; but I had almo&s;t forgot, that I have one at home out of the Pale of Salvation: Yet I &s;hall not take any Pains in her Conver&s;ion, if it is as you &s;ay) which I believe) continu'd my Un|cle; I &s;hall turn her, and her Cub, to Gra&s;s, tho' with a moderate Maintenance, yet much more than they de&s;erve. But we'll let all Thoughts of that Affair &s;leep awhile, for the Ladies will be here by and by, and I have never any thing that looks like Di&s;content when we are together.</P>
<P>I found a &s;ecret Plea&s;ure in the Hopes I had of &s;eeing the amiable <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; but then, intruding Fears wou'd creep in to di&s;turb my
<PB N="118" REF="124">
Thoughts. I imagin'd I &s;hou'd be &s;lighted, or perhaps &s;he might di&s;clo&s;e my Pa&s;&s;ion to her Mother, or Aunt, and then all my Hopes wou'd be intirely lo&s;t; for I had not any No|tion they wou'd, either of 'em, con&s;ent to my De&s;ires. The Time was &s;pent between Hopes and Fears, 'till the Arrival of the Ladies. When they came in, any one might have perceiv'd my Pa&s;&s;ion by my Counte|nance; but they were &s;o much taken up with their Di&s;cour&s;e about Mr. <HI>Bridgford</HI>'s Affairs, they had not the Lei&s;ure to mind any thing el&s;e. My Concern was redoubled at the lit|tle Notice <HI>I&s;abella</HI> took of me, and her en|tring &s;o readily into the Conver&s;ation, with|out &s;o much as vouch&s;afing me a &s;ingle Look, almo&s;t di&s;tracted me; &s;o that I took a pro|per Opportunity to retire, to conceal my Confu&s;ion. I went into the Garden to in|dulge my Melancholy: Finding &s;o many Rea&s;ons to increa&s;e it, that had almo&s;t di|&s;tracted me, I was &s;o lo&s;t in Thought, that I did not con&s;ider how the Time went a|way; and 'tis po&s;&s;ible I might have remain'd in my Mu&s;ing till Night, if a Servant had not told me Dinner was &s;erv'd.</P>
<P>I was in &s;ome Confu&s;ion, to think what Excu&s;e I &s;hou'd make for my long Ab|&s;ence.
<PB N="119" REF="125">
When I came into the Dining-Room, my Uncle ask'd me where I had been &s;o long. I told him, I found them &s;o very deeply engag'd in their Story, that, as I knew my Company wou'd not contribute any thing to the Conver&s;ation, I cho&s;e to take a Walk in the Garden, and my Imagination wandring, I had lo&s;t my&s;elf for &s;ome time. I was very much rally'd for my Speech, by every body. I thought, &s;aid the <HI>Aunt,</HI> the Company of <HI>I&s;abella</HI> wou'd have had &s;uffi|cient Strength to have held you here. I &s;up|po&s;e, return'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> the young Gentleman has been &s;o well tutor'd by his Uncle, that he is beginning to put his Advice in Practice, by &s;hunning the Women. I told her, what|ever Advice I follow'd of my Uncle's, I was a&s;&s;ur'd neither his Inclination, or mine, wou'd debar me of the Satisfaction of their Conver|&s;ation, whatever I &s;uffer'd in Per&s;on, or Cen&s;ure. I continu'd my Excu&s;e, by telling 'em, the Story was not new to me, and I thought it wou'd be &s;ome time before they wou'd have Lei&s;ure to enter upon any other Subject. Whatever I had to &s;ay in my Ju|&s;tification, had not &s;topt their Mouths, if Dinner had not. While it la&s;ted, I narrow|ly ob&s;erv'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> but cou'd not get one
<PB N="120" REF="126">
Look from her. I had but little Stomach, as tho&s;e in my Circum&s;tances may ea&s;ily ima|gine, tho' none made any Ob&s;ervation upon it. When Dinner was over, we all walk'd in the Garden, and my Endeavours to &s;ingle out <HI>I&s;abella</HI> prov'd fruitle&s;s, which much in|creas'd my Agony of Mind.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, Mr. <HI>Bridgford,</HI> his new Wife, and Mr. <HI>Brooks</HI> the Sailor, came to vi&s;it my Uncle. Tho', &s;aid Mr. <HI>Bridg|ford,</HI> it is not u&s;ual for new-marry'd People, the Day after their Wedding, to make Vi|&s;its, yet my Wife and I thought it partly our Duty to wait upon this good Company, to take our Leaves of 'em; for, continu'd he, tho' a Week pa&s;t I was no Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, yet now I find I have Work enough on my Hands, not to mention my Matrimonial Af|fair. I am oblig'd to leave you for Twenty Days. The Smiles of Fortune mu&s;t be re|garded, or &s;he may change her Countenance. I have experienc'd it, therefore am re&s;olv'd to keep up her Good-Humour, if it lies in my Power. I mu&s;t own, the Sorrows that touch me at pre&s;ent, are rais'd from what I feel in parting (tho' but for a &s;hort Time) with &s;uch Company as will always be very dear to me. Many Compliments pa&s;s'd be|tween
<PB N="121" REF="127">
the Parties, but they were ended by ta|king Leave, for Mr. <HI>Bridgford</HI> &s;et out for <HI>London</HI> from my <HI>Uncle</HI>'s, with his <HI>Spou&s;e,</HI> and his Kin&s;man the <HI>Sailor,</HI> who found it nece&s;|&s;ary for his immediate Pre&s;ence. After the u&s;ual Compliment of Tea, the Ladies were re&s;olv'd to go Fi&s;h; it &s;eems it was their common Recreation; and accordingly, their Implements were carry'd to the River, no far|ther than the Bottom of my Uncle's Garden. I was re&s;olv'd to be only a Looker-on, as not being compos'd enough to follow the Pa&s;time; and perhaps I might have run the Hooks in|to my Fingers, in&s;tead of the Baits. Every one had tolerable good Sport, but <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and her ill Luck made her fret much. <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid my Uncle, this is a Diver&s;ion you de|light in. You know the Fi&s;hes retiring Holes; pray &s;ee if you can help the young Lady to a little better Fortune. I told my Uncle, I wou'd contribute all I cou'd to <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>'s Entertainment, with a very good In|clination. Come, Madam, &s;aid I, if you will be pleas'd to walk a little farther, we'll &s;ee if Change of Place may not change your Luck. She made me no An&s;wer, but with a conde&s;cending Nod, follow'd me. I took care to take her out of the Sight and Hearing
<PB N="122" REF="128">
of the re&s;t of the Company. I then look'd a little carefully after her Bait and Tackle, and &s;he caught a Fi&s;h pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid &s;he, I find my Luck is chang'd; but yet I am but half reconcil'd to the barba|rous Diver&s;ion; it does not &s;uit with the ten|der Sentiments of our Sex, to rob any thing of Life; neither can I &s;ee the Death of a poor <HI>Partridge,</HI> or the mo&s;t diminutive Bird, widiout a &s;ecret Tenderne&s;s and Sorrow for its being robb'd of Life, which it is not in our Power to re&s;tore again. But yet, Ma|dam, &s;aid I, with all this Tenderne&s;s of Soul, you can &s;ee a poor &s;uffering Wretch in all the Agonies of De&s;pair, without thinking once of Pity. I am &s;orry, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> you &s;hou'd tax me with a Crime I mo&s;t ab|hor; but, as I am innocent, it does not give me much Unea&s;ine&s;s. Madam, I reply'd, I &s;peak of Proof; I am the poor &s;uffering Wretch, wounded by your re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Charms, which you know very well, and you'll neither give me Death, nor Ea&s;e. Why indeed, young Gentleman, return'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> this Play|ing at Lovers is what we now &s;hou'd leave off. We are too young to act in Reality, and too old to act in Je&s;t. I'll allow, your Under&s;tanding runs &s;omething before your
<PB N="123" REF="129">
Years; but, to tell you ingenuou&s;ly, if it were otherwi&s;e, I don't think for my&s;elf, I have a Mother and Aunt, who have the Pri|vilege to think for me, and they &s;o worthily de&s;erve tho&s;e Characters, I hope I &s;hall ne|ver have a Thought again&s;t their Inclination. I reply'd, it was my De&s;ire &s;he never &s;hou'd, I only wi&s;h'd &s;he wou'd have a favourable Regard for me, and give me the &s;malle&s;t Grounds to hope I was not hateful to her. She reply'd, <HI>Hate</HI> was not in her Nature; and that &s;he cou'd &s;ay no more, than that &s;he e&s;teem'd me equally with all Mankind, and enough to be concern'd at any ill Accident that &s;hou'd happen to me.</P>
<P>I was &s;o tran&s;ported at this faint Glimp&s;e of Hope &s;he gave me, that my Tongue broke out in extravagant Expre&s;&s;ions of Thanks. Hold, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, you'll di&s;turb the Fi&s;h, and &s;poil the Diver&s;ion I expect; be&s;ide, my Mother and Aunt will hear ypu, and I have kept your former Confe&s;&s;ion from them, according to your De&s;ire; but will not promi&s;e Secrecy for the Future, it is a great Task for one of my Years. I had not time to make her a Reply, for the re&s;t of the Company had near join'd us, to know whe|ther <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Luck was chang'd or no. Tru|ly,
<PB N="124" REF="130">
&s;aid &s;he, I have no Rea&s;on to complain, I have caught two, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of this young Gentleman; and had like to have caught another, but, for want of Experience, had let him go again. Ay, but <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid my Uncle, can teach you how to play a Fi&s;h up and down the Stream, when once you have it fa&s;t, and be in no Danger of lo&s;ing it. You mu&s;t manage a <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> as you will here|after do <HI>Hearts</HI>; tho', I mu&s;t own, if hand|&s;ome Women are mere Fools (which is not <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Ca&s;e) they &s;oon learn that. We don't allow you to be a Judge, reply'd <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> your Heart has been Eye-proof all your Life; or el&s;e you have conceal'd that Part of it from us. Why, reply'd my Un|cle, if I have never lov'd, I might have had Attempts made upon me, enough to find out the Cunning of the Sex; as your Aunt, I &s;uppo&s;e, may an&s;wer for ours. I don't de|&s;ire to have the Que&s;tion begg'd, reply'd the Aunt; but this I am &s;ure of, there's no knowing whether a Man courts the Pur&s;e, or the Per&s;on. For my Part, return'd my Un|cle, I think a Woman, without a Pur&s;e, is but a de&s;picable Creature. I wi&s;h we cou'd find out &s;ome other Di&s;cour&s;e, return'd the Widow; I think, when we meet, we can
<PB N="125" REF="131">
never talk upon any other Subject, and, be|cau&s;e we de&s;pi&s;e it, I think it the be&s;t way quite to forget it.</P>
<P>While this Di&s;cour&s;e la&s;ted, I ob&s;erv'd <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> more thoughtful than u&s;ual, and I cou'd not help &s;ecretly hoping, I might have &s;ome Concern in her Mu&s;ing. Yet I was very un|ea&s;y I cou'd not get an Opportunity to &s;peak to her the whole Evening. As we were ta|king Leave, my Uncle promis'd to Dine with 'em the third Day following, and the Thought gave me &s;ome Con&s;olation.</P>
<P>When the Company was gone, my Uncle and I walk'd in the Garden again. Well, &s;aid he, I mu&s;t own the Thoughts of the Per|&s;idy of this ungrateful Woman do not &s;it &s;o ea&s;y upon me, as I cou'd have wi&s;h'd; in &s;pite of all my Fortitude, it &s;tole in upon the Plea&s;ure of the Day, and &s;our'd my Satisfac|tion. But, continu'd he, I am re&s;olv'd to have an End put to every thing on that Ac|count, to-morrow, if it's po&s;&s;ible; but I am a little at a <HI>Nonplus</HI> about it; it wou'd vex me, if we cou'd not bring it about, for Doubt is a very unea&s;y Companion. Sir, &s;aid I, you have a back Way up to your Study, and I believe it will be no great Difficulty to &s;teal in unob&s;erv'd of any body. You mu&s;t
<PB N="126" REF="132">
give it out to-night, that you will be abroad to-morrow, all the Morning, and I mu&s;t wait on you. That &s;hall be done at Supper, &s;aid my Uncle. 'Till that Time came, my di&s;tracted Thoughts were roving on the dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and Hope and Fear, by turns, po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd my Soul. Young as I was, I perceiv'd Death wou'd be more welcome to me, than her Di&s;dain. At Supper, my Uncle told me we &s;hou'd ri&s;e betimes to go a Hunting, with &s;ome Gentlemen that he nam'd; and, added he, I de&s;ign to take my Leave of that Diver|&s;ion, for &s;ome time, having &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s will keep me at home for a few Days. I ob&s;ev'd the Countenance of the Hou&s;ekeeper, and thought I &s;aw her &s;hut up in her Brain &s;ome &s;ecret Intention. When &s;he was gone from Table, my Uncle &s;aid, he did not know how to order it, for it's po&s;&s;ible &s;he may go to this Rogue of a Lawyer, and con&s;ult there; and then our Project will come to nothing. We mu&s;t tru&s;t to that, Sir, &s;aid I; we &s;hall &s;oon find it out, and if it proves &s;o, we mu&s;t wait till &s;ome fitter Opportunity. Well, &s;aid my Uncle, we &s;hall &s;ee how it proves to|morrow. But, <HI>Billy,</HI> I'd have you go up into the Study, unbolt the Door that leads to the Back-Stairs, lock it only, then bring me the Key.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="133">As I was coming from doing what he or|der'd me, I took Notice the Hou&s;ekeeper was bu&s;y in Talk with her Son. Immediate|ly after, the Boy took his Hat, and went out. I told my Uncle what I had &s;een. We both imagin'd the Boy was gone to give No|tice of our going abroad the next Day, for Mr. &mdash; the Lawyer, liv'd but a little way from my Uncle's. Why, &s;aid my Un|cle, after all, Su&s;picion &s;trengthens our Ima|gination, and every Action of a &s;u&s;pected Per&s;on alarms us; I wi&s;h I cou'd be &s;ure he is gone there. That you &s;hall pre&s;ently, Sir, &s;aid I. Upon &s;aying that, I immediately fol|low'd him, and walking a good round Pace, got Sight of him ju&s;t as he rung at the Door. I got time enough at the back-&s;ide of the Porch, unob&s;erv'd, ju&s;t as the Door was o|pen'd. The Boy ask'd for Mr. &mdash; who came out to him pre&s;ently. As &s;oon as he &s;aw him, I under&s;tood he was very fond of him, and call'd him his <HI>Dear Boy.</HI> Sir, &s;aid the Boy, my Mother gives her Service to you, and &s;ent me to tell you, that the Squire goes out to-morrow to Hunt, 'till Dinner-time, and will expect you by Ten in the Morning. My Love, &s;aid he, I'll be &s;ure to come; I won't ask you to &s;tay now, becau&s;e I have
<PB N="128" REF="134">
&s;ome Company with me. So away went the Boy, whi&s;tling home; and I follow'd, a more &s;low Pace than I went out.</P>
<P>When I came to my Uncle, I inform'd him all I had heard. Well, &s;aid he, I find it will come to the Cata&s;trophe to-morrow. I'll go to Bed, and think over my Part. So we parted. And I am apt to believe, both our Pillows were unea&s;y enough. Tho' my Pa&s;&s;ion kept me long awake, yet I cou'd not chu&s;e having &s;ome Concern at what wou'd happen on the Morrow. When we ro&s;e in the Morning, we both mounted, with a Ser|vant; and after riding about a Quarter of a Mile, my Uncle (as we had concerted) told me, he had no very great Go&ucirc;t to the Sport, therefore wou'd e'en go back again. But you, &s;aid he to me, and <HI>Tom</HI> (meaning the Man) may go, if you plea&s;e. No, Sir, &s;aid I, I don't care for going without you. So we turn'd our Hor&s;es Heads homewards; and as we were going &s;lowly along, my Uncle order'd the Man to take all the three Hor&s;es to Town (about two Mile from my Uncle's) and be&s;peak new Saddles. So we alighted, walk'd over the Park, and got into the Li|brary, unperceiv'd of any. When we were in, we bolted the Door on the In&s;ide, and
<PB N="129" REF="135">
each of us took a Book in our Hands, to pa&s;s away the Time till the Play was to be|gin, for it was not proper to talk to each other; but yet, I believe, we neither of us well knew what we were reading.</P>
<P>The private Door we came in at, was con|triv'd by my Uncle, that he might more conveniently make Madam a Vi&s;it, unob&s;erv'd by the Family, when his Concerns call'd him, and the Door of her Apartment join'd to it, upon the Head of the Stairs, which we &s;oon heard open; the Lawyer enter'd alone, where he &s;taid &s;ome time, and diverted him&s;elf with humming a Song. At la&s;t, the Lady came to him, who inform'd him, &s;he cou'd not come &s;ooner, being &s;he was oblig'd to &s;ee the Coa&s;t a little clear.</P>
<P>We &s;oon found, by the Lawyer's Di&s;cour&s;e, he had &s;ome Inclination to be merry, before they talk'd of their Affairs. Come, come, &s;aid Madam, let's mind Bu&s;ine&s;s fir&s;t; we &s;hall have time enough to divert our&s;elves, I'll warrant you. Ay, but reply'd the Law|yer, 'tis better to be caught in Conver&s;ation, than the other Affair; therefore let's make an End of that fir&s;t. And we &s;oon found, he was re&s;olv'd not to be deny'd.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136">During this Bu&s;ine&s;s, 'twas plea&s;ant to &s;ee my Uncle's Countenance, which was com|pos'd of half a Smile, about one fourth Part Shame (as I &s;uppo&s;e, to have me a &s;ort of an Auditor in this unlook'd-for dumb Work,) and the other Fourth, Anger. I believe &s;uch a Face cou'd not be compounded out of <HI>Le Brun</HI>'s <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> When their loving Affair was over, Con&s;ultation came on.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid the Lady, what's to be done? I have Rea&s;on to fear every thing; for I find this Boy grows upon him every Day. To tell you the Truth, reply'd the <HI>Lawyer,</HI> I'm at a Fault, and have lo&s;t the Scent, and know not how to proceed. I know you Wo|men are more fruitful in Inventions of this kind. Indeed, if the Squire's Head were once laid, I cou'd find an Expedient to &s;e|cure the be&s;t Part of the E&s;tate, without Danger, or finding out. 'Tis not the fir&s;t time I have di&s;inherited the True Heir, with|out the Con&s;ent of the Predece&s;&s;or, even for a &s;mall Sum; and you may be &s;ure I &s;hou'd u&s;e my utmo&s;t Skill for <HI>Thomas,</HI> who is our own Child; tho' the Squire, I believe, ima|gines him&s;elf &s;ole Proprietor in <HI>You</HI> and <HI>Him.</HI> It's a very perplexing thing, I vow! reply'd the Hou&s;ekeeper; I wi&s;h both their Necks
<PB N="131" REF="137">
broke to-day in Hunting, with all my Heart! Ay, that wou'd do, reply'd the Lawyer. I'd find a Will by to-morrow Night (like <HI>Mo&s;|cas</HI> in the <HI>Fox</HI>) &s;hou'd di&s;appoint every bo|by el&s;e, without coming near his Puni&s;hment. Well, I hope it's no Crime, return'd the Hou&s;ekeeper to wi&s;h 'em both in Heaven; nay, if I lent a helping Hand to fit 'em for their Journey, I believe my Con&s;cience wou'd be as drow&s;y, as if it had &s;ip'd off a Do&s;e of <HI>Laudanum.</HI> Oh fy! return'd the Lawyer; let us not think of Murder, however; tho', if we were in <HI>Italy,</HI> I cou'd &s;oon procure a Trade&s;man or two that deal that way, wou'd do the Work neatly, and very cheap too. But let us not think of that any farther, than in our good Wi&s;hes. And now let me hear what you can propo&s;e. What Ready-money does he generally keep at home? (Not that I purpo&s;e to rob him, I have a better Prin|ciple.) Or what <HI>Bank</HI> or <HI>Gold&s;miths</HI> Notes has he at a time. I don't know, reply'd the Hou&s;ekeeper, he keeps him&s;elf very clo&s;e as to tho&s;e Matters, and I &s;eldom &s;ee any of his Money, but his paltry Hundred a Year that he allows me, and what I can &s;hip out of Hou&s;ekeeping, cutting off Trade&s;men's Bills, and &s;o &s;orth, which does not amount to above Fifty more.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="138">Come, come, return'd the Lawyer, that's good Pay only for rubbing a Man's Head that's turn'd of <HI>Fifty</HI>; he does not give you much Trouble, I believe. I wonder how you wou'd conceal your Joy, to &s;ee that Head we &s;peak of dangling over the Hor&s;e's Tail, brought home as <HI>Crook-back'd Richard</HI>'s was, with his Neck, broke. That wou'd be a joyful Sight indeed, return'd the virtuous Hou&s;ekeeper. My Uncle cou'd bear no more, but ru&s;h'd in upon them, ju&s;t as &s;he had ended. But &s;ince I have &s;av'd my Neck hitherto, return'd my Uncle, I am re&s;olv'd to hunt le&s;s, that I may not cau&s;e &s;uch an Alteration in your Minds, for tho&s;e violent Emotions of the Soul often endanger the Body.</P>
<P><HI>Per&s;eus</HI>'s Shield cou'd not have a greater Effect on tho&s;e that &s;aw it, than the Pre&s;ence of my Uncle had upon tho&s;e two Wretches, for they both &s;tood like Statues; but my Uncle put a little Life into the Lawyer with his Cane; yet not being fully reviv'd, he ran round the Room &s;everal times, before he cou'd find the Door. At every Stroke of Ac|knowledgment my Uncle gave him for the Favours de&s;ign'd him, he expo&s;tulated with him; and, to end his Favours, kick'd him down Stairs, telling him, he wou'd not take
<PB N="133" REF="139">
any other Revenge, becau&s;e, indeed, he did not think it worth while; but bid him go like a Villain as he was, and let his Crime be his Puni&s;hment. But if he offer'd to make any Words in the Affair, he wou'd find &s;ome other Method, be&s;ides expo&s;ing him, to have him puni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>The Lawyer made no Reply, and, I be|lieve, thought him&s;elf very well off. Nei|ther was there much Fear of his Tattling, be|cau&s;e it wou'd only expo&s;e him&s;elf. Now came the Lady's Share of the Matter, who &s;tood quaking and trembling in a Corner of the Room. Will your Lady&s;hip be pleas'd, &s;aid my Uncle, with your utmo&s;t Expedi|tion, to pack up your Trumpery, and walk off? All the ill U&s;age you may expect from me, is to forget you; tho' I think no Pu|ni&s;hment bad enough for you. Neither &s;hall I leave you, or your Brat, to &s;tarve (who in deed is innocent) but allow him the Hundred Pounds a Year for his Life, that he may not &s;uffer for the Faults of his Parents. Go, con|tinu'd my Uncle; let me have no Reply; take what, you can with you, and &s;end for the re&s;t when you think fit. She went down Stairs, follow'd by my Uncle; and when &s;he had taken a few Things, went out, without
<PB N="134" REF="140">
opening her Mouth; but whether Grief, or Anger, ty'd her Tongue, I can't tell. When &s;he was gone, my Uncle order'd all her Things to be put together, ready again&s;t they were &s;ent for, to the great Surprize of the re&s;t of the Servants.</P>
<P>After Dinner, my Uncle took me with him to Town, to a Lawyer of his Acquaintance, and order'd him to fill up a Deed, that made his E&s;tate liable to a Hundred Pounds <HI>per An|num,</HI> to be paid during the Life of the Hou&s;e|keeper's Son, tho' not quite Fourteen. I was made one of the Witne&s;&s;es. The next Morn|ing, my Uncle order'd it to be &s;ent to his Mother, for her to be &s;atisfy'd; but the Law|yer that made it, was to be the Tru&s;tee, who&s;e Hone&s;ty and Probity were as great as the other's Villainy. We then &s;et out for the Widow's Hou&s;e; and my Uncle told me in the Coach, he was re&s;olv'd to be merry, not|with&s;tanding this Bu&s;tle that happen'd: And, young Man, &s;aid he, <HI>You</HI> have <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> Cau&s;e for Mirth at what has fall'n out, for your E&s;tate will be increas'd; for if I had made my Will before, or not have found 'em out, I &s;hou'd have left 'em more con&s;iderably.</P>
<P>When we came to the Widow's, my Un|cle told 'em the whole Story, and they all
<PB N="135" REF="141">
&s;eem'd mightily pleas'd upon my Account; for they imagin'd the Son of the Hou&s;ekeeper was to have been Heir. Yet I fan&s;y'd <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>'s Countenance &s;eem'd the lea&s;t concern'd, which &s;truck me to the Soul. After Dinner, I got the happy Opportunity of being alone with her, tho' I imagin'd it was with much Regret on her Side. Madam, &s;aid I, my Uncle's expected Fortune does not give me half that Satisfaction, as this Opportunity, if you wou'd be pleas'd to con&s;ider my Pa&s;&s;ion. I have con&s;ider'd it &s;o far, Sir, return'd <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> that I de&s;ire we may think of it no more. The An&s;wer &s;he gave, &s;truck me dumb with Grief; and it was &s;ome time be|fore my troubled Heart permitted my Tongue to &s;peak. Well, Madam, then, &s;aid I, you have re&s;olv'd my Death. I own, even the Hopes of Fortune do not give me Merit enough to rai&s;e my Eyes to &s;uch a Pitch of Happine&s;s. But Time, that produces very &s;trange things, may befriend me in That. I have told you, Sir, return'd the young La|dy, our Years are too few to admit of Love; but whenever I &s;hall feel the gentle Flame, I have very good Rea&s;ons to believe, I &s;hall not much con&s;ult Fortune; I am convinc'd that Money-Matches are not always the hap|pie&s;t;
<PB N="136" REF="142">
yet the fir&s;t thing ask'd in this Age is, <HI>What Fortune has &s;he?</HI> If that an&s;wers their Expectations, then they proceed; if not, they look out farther, and barter for a Wife, as they wou'd for a Set of Coach-Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>In all our Di&s;cour&s;e, I had &s;ome Hope, becau&s;e I cou'd not find any Grounds for ha|ting me; neither cou'd I prevail upon her to declare any thing in favour of me. Her ge|neral An&s;wer was her Want of Years; yet &s;he told me, &s;he had Di&s;cretion enough to conceal my Pa&s;&s;ion for her; and &s;he wou'd often &s;ay her Rea&s;on was, that if a Per&s;on cou'd not have an Inclination for a Lover, yet they ought to have &s;ome Regard for 'em. I was pre&s;&s;ing her to give me &s;ome Token that I was not indifferent to her, when my Uncle came in, and interrupted us. It was, I own, the fir&s;t time I ever thought his Company a Trouble. Come, young Man, &s;aid he, you'll be &s;u&s;pected, you have been together a long time. The Mother and Aunt &s;ent me to part you. Be&s;ides, yonder's Matter for the young Lady's Tears, the Bu|rial of two Lovers. We all went into the Garden, and &s;aw two Coffins bearing to the Church. We were told, the young Man
<PB N="137" REF="143">
had liv'd in the Neighbourhood, and court|ing a young Woman of the next Pari&s;h, her Father had prevail'd upon her to marry ano|ther of a better E&s;tate, which occa&s;ion'd the young Man's Death, for the Morning of the Marriage was the la&s;t of his Life, ma|king the River his Winding-Sheet. The Bride and Bridegroom coming from Church, were &s;top'd by his Corp&s;e lying in their Way; the melancholy Object had &s;uch an Effect upon the Bride, that &s;he fell down &s;peechle&s;s on the Body, and in a few Days expir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d with Grief. And her la&s;t Reque&s;t was, to be bury'd together.</P>
<P>The Story made us all very melancholy, and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> cou'd not forbear &s;hedding Tears at the Relation; but we rally'd one another out of our Sorrow. Methinks, &s;aid the Mo|ther, this Story wou'd make a very good tender Ballad. You need not fear the Bal|lad, reply'd the Aunt, by &s;ome <HI>Grub-&s;treet</HI> Bard or other. Why, &s;aid my Uncle, can't you make a Ballad, <HI>Billy</HI>? I have &s;een &s;ome of your Tran&s;lations from <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Ele|gies,</HI> and &s;uch a di&s;mal Subject, in my Ima|gination, will fit your Mu&s;e to a Hair. <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> &s;eem'd mighty fond of &s;uch a Thing; tho' I declin'd it, as having never drank of
<PB N="138" REF="144">
the Streams of <HI>Helicon.</HI> But when we came home, I &s;at down, and lanch'd out, tho' I did not under&s;tand how to &s;teer my Mu&s;e. But the Hopes of plea&s;ing <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> made me embark; and the next Day, I &s;ent her the following Letter, by a Servant of my Un|cle's, with a Charge to deliver it into her own Hands.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>When the Servant return'd, he inform'd me, he had given it into her own Hands, unperceiv'd of any one. I &s;hew'd my Uncle the Song, who told me, he believ'd it as good as any of the <HI>Grub-&s;treet</HI> Quill-drivers cou'd write; but he wou'd not allow it to be a Degree better; however, &s;aid he, it may plea&s;e the Women well enough, who &s;eldom con&s;ider Sen&s;e, but Sound. I reply'd, I was to be excus'd, it being my fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay, and very probably might be my la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150">While we were at Dinner, a Me&s;&s;enger came with a Letter from my Father, de&s;iring my Uncle to let me come home for a few Days, in order to get every thing ready for the Univer&s;ity; when that was done, I &s;hou'd return, and &s;tay with him till I was to go there. My Uncle agreed to it, and wou'd accompany me him&s;elf. Sir, &s;aid I, wou'd it not be proper to wait upon the Ladies, to take Leave? Ho! return'd my Uncle, are you &s;o loth to part with 'em for &s;o &s;hort a Time? What will you do, when you are at the Univer&s;ity, where you mu&s;t not return for the fir&s;t Year? For a whole Year, Sir? &s;aid I: Is there a Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;taying &s;o long, before I wait on you, or any of my Relations? Yes, reply'd my Uncle, if you wou'd be thought to mind your Studies; but I can't perceive, continu'd he, there is a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for going there at all; and that is the Rea&s;on why I &s;hall wait on your Wor&s;hip to your Father, to endeavour to per&s;uade him to let you and your Tutor be with me; I dare an&s;wer for you, it will not hinder the Progre&s;s of your Learning; you &s;hall want neither Ma&s;ters, Books, nor Money; and I am convinc'd the Univer&s;ities often &s;poil more Youth, than they cultivate with good Edu|cation.
<PB N="145" REF="151">
Youth is like Wax, fit for any Im|pre&s;&s;ion; they as &s;oon take an ill, as a good one. Tho', I mu&s;t own, I have nothing to fear from you; and I freely confe&s;s, 'tis the Regret I have to part with you, makes me de&s;ire your not going to the Univer&s;ity; tho' if it does not agree with your Sentiments, I &s;hall &s;ay no more about it. I told him, I was very well inclin'd to it, and cou'd not but a|gree with his Thoughts. Well then, &s;aid my Uncle, we'll away immediately, and, if it's po&s;&s;ible, return to-morrow. I hope that &s;hort Ab&s;ence from the Ladies will not break your Heart.</P>
<P>I made him no Reply, but went to prepare for my Journey with a good Inclination, for, I mu&s;t own, I long'd to &s;ee my Father, and ob&s;erve how Matters were carry'd on at home, not doubting but my Mother-in-law was &s;till in the Way of Goodne&s;s; tho' I had receiv'd no Recommendation from her, ei|ther in my Father's Letter, or by the Me&s;&s;en|ger, but I knew my Father &s;eldom regarded tho&s;e formal Matters.</P>
<P>As we came within three Mile of my Fa|ther's, my Uncle's Servant &s;topt a Hor&s;e that was running away without his Rider, and a little farther, we cou'd perceive a Man lying
<PB N="146" REF="152">
weltring in Blood; when we approach'd him, we found him &s;en&s;ele&s;s; and I was &s;omething &s;urpriz'd to find it the Surgeon that had the Care of me, when I was wound|ed by my Brother. My Uncle was as much concern'd as I was, when he knew who it was. We took him up, and found his Scull was fractur'd; but we did not doubt, if we cou'd get timely Aid, but he might be reco|ver'd. We put him into my Uncle's Coach, and drove to the next Town, with all the Expedition was con&s;i&s;tent with the Surgeon's Condition; by good Fortune, we met with one of his own Acquaintance and Profe&s;&s;ion, who took him in Hand, dre&s;s'd him, and brought him to his Sen&s;es, tho' with much Fear of his Life; he being a gro&s;s Man, a Fever had &s;eiz'd the Blood; and all agreed, his Life was in Danger. However, he &s;eem'd very much pleas'd to find me &s;o near him; and I had &s;ome Thoughts it might prove a convenient Opportunity to work out that Se|cret he inform'd me he knew of my Mother-in-law; but finding it not proper to talk much, I re&s;olv'd with my&s;elf to come to him again: So we took our Leaves, and arriv'd &s;afe at my Father's, who, not expecting us the &s;ame Day he &s;ent to us, was gone to vi&s;it a neighbouring Gentleman.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="153">My Mother &s;eem'd very much rejoic'd at our Arrival, and welcoming me with Tears, her Tenderne&s;s gave me no &s;mall Satisfaction. My Brother <HI>John,</HI> indeed, look'd as glum upon me, as if I had been come to rob him of his Birth-right. My Uncle perceiving his Behaviour, rattled him, in his merry way; but it had no other Effect, than bringing Tears into his Eyes, and running to tell Ma|ma. Zounds! &s;ays my Uncle (when he was gone) what a Country Cub it is! Why don't they put him Prentice to a Farmer, for he'll never be fit for any thing, but to follow the Plough.</P>
<P>When my Father came home, he told my Uncle, he did not think he &s;hou'd have com|ply'd with his De&s;ires &s;o &s;oon, as not expect|ing me in two or three Days. Why, &s;aid my Uncle, we made the more Expedition here, that we may return the &s;ooner; and, becau&s;e you &s;hou'd not keep him too long, I came with him, to carry him back. In &s;hort, the Matter was made up that Night. It was agreed my Tutor and I &s;hou'd go back with my Uncle. I mu&s;t own, I was not a little pleas'd, for I fear'd the good Woman, my Mother-in-law, might oppo&s;e it; but &s;he readily con&s;ented, to &s;ave Charges, I &s;up|po&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="154">While I was walking in the Garden alone, <HI>Betty</HI> came up to me, and wept for Joy to &s;ee me. Well, &s;aid I, <HI>Betty,</HI> how go Mat|ters between you and my Mother? Is the Affair made up? I hope I am to take no more <HI>Phy&s;ic!</HI> The poor Girl was ready to &s;ink at the Word <HI>Phy&s;ic.</HI> Indeed, Sir, &s;aid &s;he (after a long Pau&s;e) I believe you know every thing of former Affairs; but if you do, you al&s;o know I have &s;ufficiently repented of my Part, and I hope my Mi&s;tre&s;s has of hers. I gave her &s;o many Hints, that &s;he confe&s;s'd every thing. I was &s;truck with Horror at her Relation, for &s;he di&s;cover'd &s;uch Traps they had de&s;ign'd to get rid of me, that I thought it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hou'd en|ter into the Minds of Women. Sir, &s;aid <HI>Betty,</HI> you may find, by my Story, I am at a true Confe&s;&s;ion; nay, I wou'd kneel down at your Feet for Pardon, if it might not be ob&s;erv'd by any body. I told her, I had pardon'd her long ago, as well as my Mo|ther, who might have had &s;omething of a &s;tronger Tye to u&s;e me well, than &s;he. I hope, &s;aid <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;he has forgot what is pa&s;t, or if &s;he remembers it, 'tis only as I do, to think with Horror on what was de&s;ign'd, and a high Satisfaction in knowing we are in|nocent
<PB N="149" REF="155">
of the Fact; tho', pur&s;u'd &s;he, there does not &s;eem to be that Candour and Free|dom between us, as there was when we were wickedly caballing again&s;t your innocent Life; therefore I have &s;ome Intention of leaving her Service, and going to my Rela|tions in <HI>Wales,</HI> where, I hope, I have e|nough to la&s;t me moderately all my Life. I told her, I was a&s;&s;ur'd my Uncle wou'd ac|cept of her for his Hou&s;ekeeper, upon my Recommendation, if &s;he thought fit, for at pre&s;ent he had never a one. She &s;eem'd mightily rejoic'd at the Propo&s;al, telling me, it was the only Thing &s;he &s;hou'd de&s;ire. I bid her not take any Notice of it to any body, till &s;he heard from me again; which &s;he pro|mis'd, and we parted.</P>
<P>The next Day, I took an Opportunity, early in the Morning, to vi&s;it the <HI>Surgeon,</HI> and found him much better than any one ex|pected, tho' he him&s;elf had no Thoughts of Recovery. He told me, he was very much oblig'd to me, for the Care I had taken of him; and, notwith&s;tanding he was convinc'd his End was near, yet he thought Providence had a Hand in &s;ending me to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; therefore, as I wou'd not willingly go out of the World (&s;aid he) without acquainting you
<PB N="150" REF="156">
with what I had formerly hinted to you, for fear you &s;hou'd nouri&s;h the Opinion, that I wanted only to create Unea&s;ine&s;s, without any Grounds; therefore, if you plea&s;e, now I find I have Strength enough, I'll acquaint you with all I know, if you'll order the Room to be clear'd for a little while; which was &s;oon done. I &s;at down by his Bed&s;ide, when he began as follows.</P>
<P>You know, we Country-Surgeons are ge|nerally bred Apothecaries. I &s;erv'd my Time with one, eminent in both Faculties, and it was allow'd by every body, I was not behind|hand in my Ma&s;ter's Experience. He us'd to tru&s;t his Patients, in general, to me, after my Capacity had been thought equal to &s;uch a Charge.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Charles,</HI> your Mother-in-law's former Husband, liv'd near die Town, and my Ma|&s;ter was very great there; in&s;omuch, that it was thought the Knight was in a fair Road to Heaven, with my Ma&s;ter's A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but it is often the Fate of Cuckolds, to be one of the la&s;t in di&s;covering his own Horns. For &s;everal Years, the Knight and my Ma&s;ter were very gracious: They often rid a Hunt|ing together. But one Day, when it was &s;uppos'd my Ma&s;ter wanted an Opportunity
<PB N="151" REF="157">
of conver&s;ing with the Knight's Wife, took an Occa&s;ion of leaving him, making all the Ha&s;te he cou'd to vi&s;it the Lady. The Knight mi&s;&s;ing my Ma&s;ter, tho' not mi&s;tru&s;t|ing any thing of the Matter, went home like|wi&s;e, and going up to his Lady's Chamber, found the Door &s;hut; but peeping thro' the Keyhole, perceiv'd &s;he had got his Compa|nion with her, and both in a Po&s;ture not ve|ry decent. The Knight, being neither a <HI>Hercules</HI> nor an <HI>Ajax,</HI> &s;tood &s;ome time to con&s;ider what he &s;hou'd do (as he told me af|terwards) but at la&s;t, &s;ummoning all his Courage, he bur&s;t the Door open, and &s;ur|priz'd 'em very di&s;advantageou&s;ly, giving my Ma&s;ter &s;everal Strokes upon the naked Buttocks, ere he cou'd put up the proper Covering; but, being a good-humour'd ea&s;y Man, and a <HI>Wittol</HI> to boot, at their Tears and Entreaties, forgave 'em both; but wou'd not allow of my Ma&s;ter's Corre&s;pondence any more. When any thing was wanted from the Shop, I always carry'd it; till, by de|grees, I got into the good Graces of the Knight, and rid out a Hunting with him; tho' not &s;o often as my Ma&s;ter us'd to do; but I believe he gave me Leave more readily, that he might have a better Opportunity of vi&s;iting the Lady,</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="158">In one of the Knight's drunken Moods, he di&s;cover'd what I have told you, between his Wife and my Ma&s;ter, which I was igno|rant of before; but, &s;aid he, they have pro|mis'd me never to do the like again. I only &s;mil'd at his Simplicity, and confirm'd him in his Belief; tho' I was pretty well convinc'd, when I look'd a little backwards, they only met as often as they had an Opportunity. In a few Days after this Confe&s;&s;ion, when I was a Hunting with him, he &s;eem'd to be le&s;s merry than u&s;ual: I ask'd him the Rea&s;on: He told me, he believ'd his Wife continu'd to &s;ee my Ma&s;ter in a criminal manner; tho' he was not convinc'd by Proof. I ask'd him the Rea&s;on of his Belief. Said he, going in|to my Wife's Chamber this Morning, as &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf, a Letter drop'd from her Bo&s;om, which I took up, and was well a&s;&s;ur'd 'twas your Ma&s;ter's Hand; I open'd it, and had but ju&s;t time to read, <HI>My Dear,</HI> when my Wife, in &s;ome Confu&s;ion, &s;natch'd it out of my Hand, and told me it was a Letter from a Relation of hers. I told her, I was a&s;&s;ur'd it was the Doctor's Hand. Well, &s;aid &s;he, if you are jealous, you &s;han't &s;ee it now; but I'll give you Leave to read it when you come back from Hunting. I
<PB N="153" REF="159">
was forc'd to be &s;atisfy'd, continu'd the Knight; but I &s;hall be convinc'd 'tis &s;o, if &s;he pretends to have lo&s;t the Letter. The Knight took an Opportunity of &s;eeing me the &s;ame Evening. He told me, with a great deal of Joy in his Countenance, that he was deceiv'd. See here the Letter that gave me &s;o much Unea&s;ine&s;s. I took it from him, and &s;oon knew my Ma&s;ter's Hand, tho' he had endeavour'd to write not like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I cou'd not chu&s;e but &s;mile at the Cheat that was put upon him; it was plain enough that &s;he had acquainted my Ma&s;ter with the Matter, and while the Knight was gone a Hunting, he wrote her another in a Woman's Name, beginning as the other did, about no|thing at all to any Purpo&s;e. I was convinc'd in my Suppo&s;ition when I came home, for my Ma&s;ter pulling out a Parcel of Papers, gave me one to take Directions for com|pounding &s;ome Medicines; I &s;oon found it was the Father to the Letter the Knight &s;hewed &s;ome time before, for it began as the other did, and Sir <HI>Charles</HI>'s Name was men|tion'd in it. I told my Ma&s;ter, &s;miling, I cou'd find no Directions there for me. Od&s;o! &s;aid he, I have given you the wrong Letter; that neither concerns you nor me. He immedi|ately
<PB N="154" REF="160">
fumbled out the right one, and went away in &s;ome Confu&s;ion of Countenance. I was very unea&s;y my&s;elf, that he knew I had di&s;cover'd the Secret of his Intrigue, tho' it cou'd not properly be call'd a Secret, that was whi&s;per'd every where.</P>
<P>Some time after, my Ma&s;ter was caught a|gain, making the Bea&s;t with two Backs with the Knight's Wife; which &s;o enrag'd the Cuckold, that he re&s;olv'd to have Recour&s;e to Law for Redre&s;s; but, as I was now his Oracle, I per&s;uaded him from it, tho' with &s;ome Difficulty, and in a little time his Re|&s;entment began to &s;leep again; tho' he watch'd his Wife &s;o narrowly, there cou'd be no Time to graft another Antler; for I mu&s;t own to you, I did all I cou'd to prevent it, giving him Notice, when I &s;u&s;pected any Movement that way. Yet, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, had it been my own Ca&s;e, I &s;hou'd &s;ooner have thought of revenging my&s;elf on the Cuckold-maker, than bore it &s;o patiently; but there is nothing to be &s;aid for the Tem|pers of Men.</P>
<P>This Strictne&s;s continu'd for near half a Year, and, I verily believe, much to the Di&s;content of the Lady. At la&s;t the Knight fell &s;ick, perhaps thro' his Perturbation of
<PB N="155" REF="161">
Spirit, or for want of his u&s;ual Exerci&s;e; for he had undertaken a voluntary Confinement, in order to in&s;pect the Actions of his Wife. During his Illne&s;s, &s;he &s;eem'd very tender of him, hardly ever being from his Bed&s;ide; which the good-natur'd Knight took &s;o kind|ly, that I even fan&s;y'd he was re&s;olv'd, when he was recover'd, to leave her to her own Conduct; for &s;he expre&s;s'd &s;o much Sorrow for her pa&s;t Actions, that I was my&s;elf de|ceiv'd. The Di&s;po&s;ition to Goodne&s;s of the Wife, had an extraordinary Effect on the Husband, and he began to mend apace: He left his Bed, where, thro' Weakne&s;s, he had remain'd for ten Days, and walk'd about his Chamber, gathering Strength hourly, in le&s;s Time than his Illne&s;s had kept him in Bed. He had recover'd his former Strength, and had fixt a Day with me to ride out; but, in the mean time he was to take &s;ome Phy&s;ic which I &s;ent him; but, to my great Surprize and Confu&s;ion, the Day he had taken it, I found him expiring in the utmo&s;t Agonies. He was &s;peechle&s;s when I came to him, and in le&s;s than five Minutes breath'd his la&s;t.</P>
<P>The Lady was all in Tears, rav'd at me, telling me I had certainly given him &s;ome|thing by Mi&s;take. I a&s;&s;ur'd her to the con|trary,
<PB N="156" REF="162">
and inform'd her it was compos'd by my Ma&s;ter, before my Face, and what he had taken cou'd not hurt an Infant. She held her Tongue, when &s;he under&s;tood who it was that had made up what he took, which immediately &s;truck my Fancy there was &s;ome Villainy in the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter hearing of the Knight's Death, came while I was there, and examining the Body, &s;eem'd in very great Confu&s;ion. We both went home together, without one Word pa&s;&s;ing between us. When we had been there &s;ome time, my Ma&s;ter told me he had &s;ome|thing to di&s;clo&s;e, if I wou'd &s;wear &s;olemnly to keep it a Secret. I an&s;wer'd him, if he was in any doubt of my Fidelity, to keep the Secret to him&s;elf. Well then, &s;aid he, give me your Word not to di&s;cover it, and I will tell you; which I did.</P>
<P>I am afraid, &s;aid he, the Knight has not had fair Play for his Life; for, viewing his Body, I cou'd ea&s;ily perceive &s;trong Symp|toms of Poi&s;on; and what &s;trengthens my Opinion is, that &s;ome time ago &s;he prevail'd upon me to let her have &s;ome <HI>Ratsbane,</HI> in order, as &s;he &s;aid, to clear the Granary of Vermin. I ea&s;ily came into my Ma&s;ter's Opinion; and, by his declaring it to me,
<PB N="157" REF="163">
was well a&s;&s;ur'd he was innocent. I am &s;o &s;hock'd, &s;aid my Ma&s;ter, at the Barbarity of the Woman, that I am re&s;olv'd never to go near her more; neither will I make any further En|quiry into the Bu&s;ine&s;s, but leave her to her own wicked Thoughts. Tho' perhaps I have not, in my pa&s;t Days, had any great Regard for Religion, and might leave it to be deci|ded by Chance, as the King of <HI>Maca&s;ar</HI> did <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Maca&s;ar</HI> is a large Kingdom on the South Part of the <HI>Celebes,</HI> an I&s;land in the <HI>Indian Sea.</HI> Near three Centuries ago, they wor&s;hipp'd the Sun and Moon, as the mo&s;t worthy Objects of their Adoration.

But the Prie&s;ts that were &s;ent by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> to in&s;truct 'em in the Chri&s;tian Religion, mi&s;carrying in their Voy|age, the King began to have Doubts which none of the new Chri&s;tians cou'd an&s;wer.

<P>In a few Days the Knight was bury'd, without the lea&s;t Su&s;picion of any thing but a Natural Death. My Ma&s;ter and I were invited to the Funeral, but neither of us went. And, for my own Part, I never car'd to go near the Hou&s;e; for the Thought of its har|bouring &s;o cruel a Woman, made me abhor it. My Ma&s;ter, I believe, imagin'd the &s;ame, for he never made the Widow a Vi&s;it. In a Fortnight after the Funeral, &s;he &s;ent a Let|ter to my Ma&s;ter, which was to this Effect; (for he gave it to me to read, having before that, freely declar'd to me the Corre&s;pondence that had pa&s;t between 'em.) <HI>She wonder'd
<PB N="159" REF="165">
mightily at his long Ab&s;ence; and that &s;he wou'd have come to him long before, if Decency wou'd have permitted her; but &s;he hop'd to &s;ee him that Evening, having di&s;pos'd every thing to favour their Meeting.</HI></P>
<P>My Ma&s;ter return'd her an An&s;wer, I be|lieve, little to her Expectation; telling her plainly, he re&s;olv'd never to &s;ee her more; al&s;o hinting her unnatural Barbarity to her Husband. I can't tell you what Effect it had upon her, but &s;he &s;ent no more Letters or Me&s;&s;ages. I often told my Ma&s;ter, I was a|fraid &s;he wou'd re&s;ent his &s;lighting of her, to his Prejudice: He laugh'd at that, as ima|gining him&s;elf out of her Power. But, in le&s;s than a Month's time, my unfortunate Ma&s;ter going to vi&s;it a Relation, about ten Miles from the Place where we liv'd, was found murder'd and thrown into a Cop&s;e near the Road. He lay &s;everal Days before he was found; and might have laid longer, if a Gentleman had not gone thro' that Way a Hunting. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my Heart forbod|ed &s;ome &s;uch Mi&s;chance, when &s;ending to &s;eek him at his Relation's, was inform'd he went from thence the &s;ame Evening he came there.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="166">Great Inqui&s;ition was made after the Mur|derer, but was never found to this Day; yet, whoever did it, I was well a&s;&s;ur'd within my &s;elf, the Widow had put 'em on; but as I cou'd not bring any Proof, I kept my Opi|nion to my&s;elf, well knowing, if I &s;hou'd endeavour to pro&s;ecute her, it wou'd be a cer|tain Charge to me, and perhaps di&s;cover no|thing. Yet, I mu&s;t own, I cou'd never give her a good Word; and tho' I had always a Watch upon my Tongue, yet I cou'd not avoid raving again&s;t her in all Companies.</P>
<P>Some time after the Death of my Ma&s;ter, I imagin'd I had found out the Murderer. A Trooper that was quarter'd in the Town, of a &s;udden had got into the Equipage of a Gen|tleman, and it was &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected he oc|cupy'd the Widow. I was convinc'd in my Su&s;picion. One Morning early being call'd to one that was taken &s;uddenly ill, and being oblig'd to pa&s;s by the Widow's Door, I cou'd perceive, tho' dark, her Door open, and this Trooper, mention'd before, let in by the Wi|dow her&s;elf. This Fellow, whenever he pa&s;s'd by our Shop, I cou'd perceive always a &s;udden Turn of Countenance from what he had on before. One Day, as he was pa&s;&s;ing by, &s;ome of my Neighbours were talking
<PB N="161" REF="167">
with me concerning the Murder of my late Ma&s;ter; and I cou'd not help &s;aying, loud enough to be heard by the Trooper, that I &s;u&s;pected a Per&s;on that often pa&s;s'd by our Door, had been his Murderer, and look'd full in the Fellow's Face. He chang'd as pale as A&s;hes. But all the while I &s;taid in that Town, which was upward of two Years afterwards, I never &s;et Eyes on him; and the next time I &s;aw him, I found him lurk|ing about your Father's Hou&s;e, which con|vinces me not only that he was the Murderer of my Ma&s;ter, but that he corre&s;ponds with your Mother-in-law at this Time.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, added the Doctor, I have told you this Secret, which I have kept near Se|venteen Years; neither &s;hou'd I have di&s;co|ver'd it now, if I did not firmly believe I am going into another World; for, notwith|&s;tanding every one tells me I am much bet|ter, I am convinc'd I have not ten Days to live. I endeavour'd to put him out of that idle Conceit, but all to no purpo&s;e. So I took my Leave, after promi&s;ing him to keep his Secret; and within the Time he mention'd, I was inform'd he dy'd, after telling the very Hour of his Death. I return'd home, full of many disjointed Thoughts, wondering
<PB N="162" REF="168">
how Providence had order'd my Father to marry &s;uch a wicked Woman. But then a|gain, I did not doubt but &s;he had repented of her former Wickedne&s;s, and walk'd in the Paths towards Grace, which gave me &s;ome Comfort, but not enough to hinder my wi&s;h|ing &s;he never had been one of our Family.</P>
<P><HI>Betty</HI> had told me nothing of this Affair, neither was I a&s;&s;ur'd &s;he liv'd with her at that time; but I was re&s;olv'd to be inform'd the fir&s;t Opportunity. In the Afternoon, I took an Occa&s;ion to get my Tutor out of the way, and being alone, beckon'd <HI>Betty</HI> to come to me. Pray, &s;aid I, <HI>Betty,</HI> do you know any thing of my Mother's former Husband, Sir <HI>Charles?</HI> No, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I came to live with my Lady not long before her Marriage to your Father. But, &s;aid I, know you no|thing of a Galant of my good Mother-in-law's? for I have &s;ome Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect her of being guilty that way. Indeed, &s;aid &s;he, blu&s;hing, that is the only Thing I have kept a Secret from you, and, I believe, the very Rea&s;on of my Lady's Coldne&s;s to me; for the Per&s;on &s;he corre&s;ponds with, or rather, the Per&s;on &s;he has corre&s;ponded with, for I have great Hopes &s;he has left it off, coming to me as u&s;ual, I flatly deny'd him Entrance,
<PB N="163" REF="169">
and farther told him, I was a&s;&s;ur'd my Lady wou'd break off with him, being a&s;ham'd of the Injury &s;he had done &s;o good a Hus|band. I never acquainted my Lady with what I &s;aid to him; but I ob&s;erv'd her Cold|ne&s;s took beginning &s;ome time after this. I ask'd her what &s;ort of Per&s;on he was? She told me, a young Gentleman of a very good Family, fallen to Decay, who &s;he believ'd was forc'd, thro' Nece&s;&s;ity, to what he did. That can't be the Per&s;on, &s;aid I, that I &s;u|&s;pect; for he I mean, mu&s;t be above Forty. There is, &s;aid <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;ometimes, a Man of that Age with my Lady; but &s;he ever took care to keep their Affair private, even from me; but however, I am a&s;&s;ur'd there is no criminal Conver&s;ation between 'em.</P>
<P>I did not tell <HI>Betty</HI> any thing that I knew of what the Doctor inform'd me; but we parted with an A&s;&s;urance of my &s;ucceeding with my Uncle in what I promis'd her. In the Afternoon my Uncle rid out with me, when I broke the Matter about <HI>Betty.</HI> I thought, &s;aid my Uncle, you had enough of Hou&s;ekeepers already. Sir, &s;aid I, I have enough of &s;uch a one as your la&s;t; neither am I afraid of any great Familiarity between you, for <HI>Betty</HI> is neither young, nor hand&s;ome.
<PB N="164" REF="170">
Nay, &s;aid my Uncle, I can give you a bet|ter Rea&s;on than all that, which I am a&s;&s;ur'd you'll &s;oon come into, and that is, I am not &s;o young, by Twenty Years, as I was Twen|ty Years ago. That's true, Sir, &s;aid I; but I am flatter'd I can give you a better Rea&s;on that you &s;hou'd accept of <HI>Betty,</HI> that is, it is the only Thing I can de&s;ire of you. Well, &s;aid my Uncle, your De&s;ires &s;hall be grant|ed. But we mu&s;t limit <HI>Betty</HI>'s Power; for you know the former had all in her own Hands. I told him, I wanted nothing el&s;e, but that &s;he might be accepted; we would both leave the Terms to him. But hold, &s;aid my Uncle, I have one Scruple ju&s;t now aro&s;e, concerning this Affair, which mu&s;t be got over, and that is, whether my Si&s;ter will be willing to part with her. Sir, &s;aid I, if you will hear me a little while with Patience, and give me your Word never to di&s;clo&s;e what I &s;hall tell you, I will inform you of &s;omething will very much &s;urprize you. Well, &s;aid my Uncle, I &s;hall come to your Terms, be they what they will.</P>
<P>I then related to him all that had happen'd while I was at home, in every Circum&s;tance. When I had fini&s;h'd, my Uncle was quite confounded! Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, there
<PB N="165" REF="171">
can be &s;uch a Woman breathing? If I did not give Credit to you, continu'd he, I &s;hou'd have imagin'd I had heard a Ro|mance. But, however, I am convinc'd, and think my Service for <HI>Betty</HI> but poor Recom|pence for her Return to Virtue. But I know not how to look on that injurious Woman, who may, under the Cover of Affection, &s;till retain her Barbarity. I think it wou'd be but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable to give my Brother &s;ome Hint of her former Inhumanity. A Woman of her Cunning may counterfeit Vir|tue, when &s;he is replete with Vice. I beg'd my Uncle not to take any farther Notice of it, 'till we had &s;ome Grounds of her return|ing to Wickedne&s;s; and if we &s;hou'd find the lea&s;t &s;werving from Virtue, to bring <HI>Bet|ty</HI> for Proof of what was pa&s;t, and put my Father out of all manner of Danger from her Wiles, or Re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I know not, &s;aid my Uncle; I like it not, and &s;hall hardly be per&s;uaded to conceal the Knowledge of her Perfidy. You know the old Saying, Boy, <HI>What's bred in the Bone, is never out of the Fle&s;h.</HI> Dear Uncle, &s;aid I, let me intreat you to conceal what I have told you, till we perceive &s;omething in her Conduct to give us Cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect her a|gain,
<PB N="166" REF="172">
and then you may do ju&s;t as you plea&s;e, He promis'd to comply with my Reque&s;t, which gave me no &s;mall Satisfaction.</P>
<P>When we came home, we found my Fa|ther, and Mother-in-law, very merry in the Garden; but finding my&s;elf little inclin'd to Mirth, I left my Uncle to make one of the Company. Be&s;ide, I wanted to confer with <HI>Betty,</HI> but cou'd not find her all over the Hou&s;e. I imagin'd &s;he might be walking under the Trees before the Hou&s;e, &s;o, upon that Suppo&s;ition, went to &s;eek her; when I had got thro' the Court-Yard, I perceiv'd <HI>Betty</HI> was not there; but I cou'd not help ob|&s;erving an old Woman prying about the Hou&s;e, with a Basket upon her Arm: I went to her, and demanding of her, whether &s;he had any Bu&s;ine&s;s there, &s;he an&s;wer'd &s;he had &s;ome fine Oranges for my Lady. My Lady is at pre&s;ent bu&s;y, &s;aid I; but pray let me &s;ee your Oranges; which &s;he did, after &s;ome aukward Difficulty. Her Reluctance in &s;hewing me her Fruit, rais'd a Su&s;picion in my Mind, which made me re&s;olve to be &s;atisfy'd, if po&s;&s;ible. They are fine Oranges, good Woman, &s;aid I; and I believe my La|dy will buy 'em all: But I wi&s;h you had &s;ome Peaches, for I have a great Mind to
<PB N="167" REF="173">
&s;ome, and wou'd give a good Price for 'em. I wi&s;h I had known that, &s;aid the old Wo|man, I cou'd have brought you &s;ome of the fine&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> I told her, if &s;he wou'd go back and fetch 'em, I &s;hou'd be very much oblig'd to her. You may leave your Basket in that Green-Hou&s;e, to &s;ecure 'em; I'll lock the Door, and give you the Key. She &s;eem'd willing to con&s;ent to that; &s;o I did as I &s;aid, gave her the Key, and away &s;he went. As &s;oon as &s;he was out of Sight, I went the Back-way, and got into the Green-Hou&s;e thro' the Window. I began to examine her Basket very narrowly, yet found nothing that I expected to find; but hand|ling the Oranges, I perceiv'd one of 'em to be very light, and at la&s;t found it was hol|low. I undid it, with much Difficulty, for it was put together with Pins without Heads. In it I found a Slip of Paper roll'd up, who&s;e Contents I tran&s;crib'd with a Pencil:
<LETTER>

Therefore (if you wou'd not have me believe her) let me &s;ee you to-morrow at the Bearer's Hou&s;e, where I &s;hall wait the whole Day with impatient Expectation.

</LETTER></P>
<P>When I had done, I put it up again, and, with much Difficulty, left it in the &s;ame Or|der as I found it. I then return'd to expect the Woman. I really imagin'd by this Let|ter, that my Mother-in-law de&s;ign'd to be hone&s;t, and what &s;he had wrote to her Ga|lant, was only a Pretext to keep him quiet. However I did de&s;ign to &s;u&s;pend my Judg|ment
<PB N="169" REF="175">
till the next Day; and if I perceiv'd my Mother went to the Place appointed, it wou'd not be unnatural to believe her &s;till guilty.</P>
<P>When the Woman brought me the Peaches, I ask'd her, if I &s;hou'd acquaint my Mother that &s;he was there. Yes, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, if you plea&s;e, and thank you too. I immedi|ately went, and met her coming out of the Garden. When I told her who wanted her, I cou'd perceive her Countenance change; but &s;he hid her Confu&s;ion, by wiping her Face with her Handkerchief. I wou'd fain have follow'd her, to have ob&s;erv'd (tho' at a Di&s;|tance) her Behaviour to the Woman; but &s;he took her into a back Parlour, &s;hutting the Door after her. They were a pretty while to|gether, and, when they parted, I cou'd per|ceive a great deal of Di&s;content in the Coun|tenance of my Mother-in-law. When the Woman was gone, I re&s;olv'd to follow her, and try, if by any Stratagem I cou'd find my Mother's Re&s;olutions. I &s;oon overtook her, at which &s;he &s;eem'd &s;omething &s;urpriz'd. Good Woman, &s;aid I, I came after you to know whereabouts you dwell, for your Fruit was &s;o good, as I ride out now and then, I de&s;ign to call upon you, to buy &s;ome more;
<PB N="170" REF="176">
for tho', added I, we have Fruit enough in our own Garden, it is &s;o narrowly watch'd by the Gardener, according to my Mother's Directions, that I can never get any. That is (reply'd the old Go-between) for fear you &s;hou'd eat too much. However, if you have a mind to traffick that way with me, I live in &s;uch a Place, I am ea&s;y enough to be found, every Child knows Goody &mdash; Well then, &s;aid I, I'll come to &s;ee you to-morrow in the Afternoon. Od&s;o! return'd the old Woman, now I think on't, I &s;han't be at home to-morrow; but any other time you'll be &s;ure to find me. Why, if you are not, &s;aid I, I &s;uppo&s;e you have &s;omebody at your Hou&s;e that can &s;erve me. No, indeed han't I, return'd the Woman. I ask'd her &s;o ma|ny Que&s;tions, that, tho' a Woman ignorant enough, &s;he began to &s;mell a Rat, and &s;eem'd &s;o very &s;hy in her An&s;wers afterwards, that plainly inform'd me &s;he was tir'd of my Com|pany. She at la&s;t told me, &s;he wou'd not &s;ell me any Fruit if I came for it, for fear it &s;hou'd do me an Injury. I try'd many Ways to bring her into Humour again, but to no Purpo&s;e, and I did not care to &s;ay any more, for fear &s;he &s;hou'd be confirm'd in her Su&s;picions. However, I kept her &s;o long in
<PB N="171" REF="177">
Talk, that a Man met us, who I ob&s;erv'd wanted to di&s;cour&s;e the old Woman. When he came up with us, I cou'd perceive the old Woman wink at him, and &s;eem'd to exact from him a cautious Behaviour. The Per&s;on &s;eem'd to be in &s;ome Confu&s;ion; however, he call'd her by her Name, and ask'd who&s;e Child I was; with a great many common Words of <HI>Pretty Youth,</HI> and &s;o forth; but when &s;he told him who I was, his Counte|nance expre&s;s'd the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion. He ask'd her, in a ha&s;ty manner, What Bu&s;ine&s;s I had with her? I don't know (&s;aid the old Woman) Ma&s;ter wants to buy &s;ome Fruit of me, and wou'd fain come to-morrow, and I have told him, I &s;han't be in the Way. If that be all, an&s;wer'd the Gentleman, looking wi&s;tfully on the old Woman, you may com|ply with the young Man, for I &s;uppo&s;e you will not be abroad all Day. No, &s;aid the old Woman, only in the Afternoon. Why, &s;aid I, 'tis only in the Morning that I can come out; but you &s;eem, &s;aid I to the old Woman, not very willing to part with what you deal in, to me, as perhaps doubting my Pay. But to convince you I am &s;incere in what I &s;ay, there's Money beforehand, and I de&s;ire you will &s;ave me two Dozen of the
<PB N="172" REF="178">
&s;ame I had of you to-day, and I'll be with you by Seven a Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P>She made &s;everal aukward Speeches in re|ceiving my Money; but I found the Sight of it pleas'd her very well; and &s;o we parted. I had a &s;trong De&s;ire to know their Confe|rence, but I was oblig'd to be contented till the next Day. I did not doubt of my Mo|ther-in-law's going to the Place of Rendez|vous; but then I imagin'd &s;he might go to pacify that <HI>Burleigh</HI> mention'd in the Note. However, I re&s;olv'd with my&s;elf to keep it a Secret from my Uncle, and u&s;e my utmo&s;t Endeavour to know &s;omething of their Con|ference the next Day.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e next Morning, without &s;leeping a Wink all Night, my Thoughts were &s;o con|fus'd and trouble&s;ome to me. I got out be|fore my Uncle, or any of the Family were &s;tirring, except &s;ome of the Servants. I di|rected my Steps towards the Town, and met the old Woman before I had got half way. I was &s;omewhat &s;urpriz'd, becau&s;e it was not much pa&s;t Six, which was an Hour before I promis'd to come. So, &s;aid I, good Woman, you are re&s;olv'd to &s;ave me a Walk, I &s;ee. No, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, not for that; but I have a fre&s;h Parcel of Oranges come in la&s;t Night,
<PB N="173" REF="179">
and my Lady order'd me to bring &s;ome of the fir&s;t I had. Why, good Woman, &s;aid I, &s;he can't want any yet, &s;ure; you brought her a &s;ufficient Quantity Ye&s;terday, to &s;erve her a great while, even as long as they will la&s;t good. I can't tell for that, &s;aid &s;he, but as long as &s;he order'd me to bring her &s;ome, I'll e'en carry 'em. But, &s;aid I, why did not you bring my Fruit at the &s;ame time. Laud! &s;aid the old Woman, I prote&s;t I for|got it. But I &s;hall be back pre&s;ently, and then I'll gather 'em fre&s;h for you; for as yet, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, they are growing. I &s;oon found, by all this Hurry, there was another Letter to be deliver'd, and I was re&s;olv'd to read it by fair means, or otherwi&s;e. Pray, &s;aid I, good Woman, how do you &s;ell your Ware a Dozen? Why truly, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, Half a Crown. Why then, &s;aid I, I'll give you the Money, and make my Mother a Pre&s;ent of 'em.</P>
<P>The Woman was &s;truck dumb at what I &s;aid. But at la&s;t &s;he recover'd her Confu&s;ion, and, with a &s;tammering Tongue, told me &s;he wou'd not do &s;uch a Thing for all the World. Pray, good Woman, &s;aid I, can you, out of your Wi&s;dom, tell me what Rea&s;on you have for refu&s;ing me your O|ranges,
<PB N="174" REF="180">
when I offer to pay you for 'em, and carry 'em home my&s;elf, without giving you any farther Trouble? She cou'd not give me any rea&s;onable An&s;wer to my Que|&s;tion; &s;o I e'en re&s;olv'd to declare to her my Knowledge of her Affair, which, when I had done, &s;he fell down upon her Knees, and begg'd I wou'd forgive her; telling me, &s;he wou'd never be guilty of the like again. Good Woman, &s;aid I, the Way to make me excu&s;e you, and keep this a Secret, (tho' &s;uch a guilty Commerce is the greate&s;t Crime) is to deliver me your whole Affair, and deal in|genuou&s;ly with me. I have given you con|vincing Proofs that I know your Proceedings hitherto, and &s;hall be able to judge whether you are &s;incere or no. Why then, truly, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, all I have done was merely out of Nece&s;&s;ity. Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> you know, has a very per&s;ua&s;ive Tongue, e&s;pecially back'd with his Money. Well, good Woman, &s;aid I, go on, for at pre&s;ent, I have no Ac|quaintance with the Per&s;on you mention. Really, nor I neither, but that he has come often to our Hou&s;e to meet my Lady; and it was the &s;ame Per&s;on you &s;aw with me Ye&s;ter|day.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="181">I was too eager to ask many Que&s;tions, therefore, I bid her tell me what was her pre&s;ent Errant. Nothing, Sir, but to carry a Letter in an Orange, as I did Ye&s;terday in the Afternoon. Upon that, I took out the Orange &s;he told me it was in, and read as follows:

<P>When I had read the Note, I was well convinc'd my Mother was return'd to her for|mer Vice; but cou'd not determine which was the be&s;t Way, either to &s;end the Letter, or keep it to &s;hew my Father and Uncle, to convince 'em of her Perfidy. While I was reading the Epi&s;tle, the Woman had time to come to her&s;elf; and ask'd me how &s;he &s;hou'd behave in the Affair. For, &s;aid &s;he, if I go back, Mr. <HI>Wigmore</HI> will certainly di&s;|cover me; therefore, if you will plea&s;e to in|&s;truct me in what I &s;hall &s;ay to him, I will be &s;ure to follow your Directions. Well, good Woman, &s;aid I, &s;ince you are &s;o conde|&s;cending, I'll ask your Advice, for I don't doubt, however you expre&s;s your&s;elf in Words, you have Cunning enough in your Bu&s;ine&s;s to advi&s;e me. If you think &s;o, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, you &s;hall have my Coun&s;el, &s;uch as it is. Hold then, &s;aid I, &s;ince it is &s;o, let me do as a Client &s;hou'd do, pay my Fee beforehand. Upon &s;aying this, I gave her a Crown. She was very much &s;urpriz'd at it, and view'd me from Head to Foot, as if &s;he had &s;aid, &s;he cou'd not imagine I was
<PB N="177" REF="183">
Ma&s;ter of &s;uch a Sum. When &s;he had reco|ver'd her Speech (for old Women don't want Tongue long) I find, &s;aid &s;he, by your Fee, you expect good Coun&s;el; therefore I wou'd advi&s;e you, if you can counterfeit a Hand any thing like your Mother's, to &s;end him an An&s;wer, that &s;hall forewarn him to come to her any more. I fear, &s;aid I, good Wo|man, we &s;hall be found out, for &s;uch an An|&s;wer will be too &s;udden for the kind Return &s;he &s;ent him Ye&s;terday. Why, I think you are in the right there, reply'd the old Wo|man; and I believe it was kind enough, for he ki&s;s'd it &s;everal times when he fir&s;t had it, &s;eeming greatly pleas'd; and &s;ince you don't approve of my Advice, I dare &s;wear you can tell what to do without me. Pr'y-thee, &s;aid I, good Woman, know you any thing of the Affair between my Mother-in-law and this <HI>Wigmore?</HI> Your Sincerity in your Confe&s;&s;ion &s;hall oblige me to find a Re|compence. Really, reply'd the Woman, I know nothing more, than that they have met at my Hou&s;e about &s;ome Dozen times; and I was &s;o well paid, that I mu&s;t freely own, I wi&s;h it had been oftner; for indeed, young Sir, I am a very poor Woman, and Money, as I told you before, carries a great deal of
<PB N="178" REF="184">
Per&s;ua&s;ion with it; tho' I mu&s;t needs own, I wou'd much rather have gotten Money ho|ne&s;tly: But then again, if I had not under|taken the Affair, &s;omebody el&s;e wou'd; &s;o I thought it was as much my Bu&s;ine&s;s as &mdash; Well, well, Mi&s;tre&s;s, I am not asking what was the Motive that induc'd you to it; I am pretty well acquainted with it already: But I wou'd know what Corre&s;pondence has been carry'd on between the Parties. Indeed, Sir, I know no more than I have told you before, that they meet at my Hou&s;e, and have a pri|vate Room to them&s;elves. Mr. <HI>Wigmore</HI> and your Mother, both were Strangers to me a Twelvemonth ago; and I know no more of Mr. <HI>Wigmore</HI> now, but that he comes to our Town almo&s;t every Day, and they &s;ay he lives at a Lord's about ten Mile off, but I have forgot his Name. But, Sir, I wou'd not have you defer what you intend to do, any longer, for Mr. <HI>Wigmore</HI> will think me long a coming, and perhaps come to meet me, as he has often done. You advi&s;e well, I return'd; one Word more, and I have done. Have you no Knowledge of one <HI>Bur|leigh</HI> that is mention'd in this Note? No re|ally, Sir, &s;aid &s;he; but I know there has been a Man with Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> and his Vi|&s;its
<PB N="179" REF="185">
have given him much Unea&s;ine&s;s; but I don't know the Rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P>I was convinc'd by the Woman's manner of &s;peaking, that &s;he was &s;incere in what &s;he &s;aid; and as &s;he knew nothing more, I was re&s;olv'd to ask her no more Que&s;tions; but being fortunately provided with a Pencil and &s;ome Paper, I wrote the following Words:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. WIGMORE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> HAVE at la&s;t repented of my Behaviour to a Husband that de&s;erves the be&s;t of Wives; therefore I beg you will do your endeavour to forget me, it being the &s;afety Conduct for us both. I fear I am &s;u&s;pected already, and the way to wipe off all manner of Su&s;picion, is no more to be guilty. Farewell, and be happy.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>I read the Note to the old Woman, who approv'd of it. I had counterfeited my Mo|ther's Hand &s;o well, that it cou'd hardly be di&s;tingui&s;h'd, e&s;pecially being wrote with a Pencil And I order'd the Woman to tell Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> that my Mother was in a Chamber where &s;he had not the Conveniency of Pen and Ink. The old Woman put it up in the room of the other, giving me her Promi&s;e to be very faithful in her new Com|mi&s;&s;ion.
<PB N="180" REF="186">
I gave her A&s;&s;urance of being well rewarded for her Pains, and &s;o we parted.</P>
<P>As I was going home, I began to con&s;ider what I had done, and &s;oon imagin'd this Affair of my Mother's cou'd not be long a Secret; therefore I re&s;olv'd within my&s;elf to take an Opportunity of di&s;clo&s;ing it to her, with a faithful Account of all the Proceed|ings, as well as the Knowledge I had of her intended barbarous De&s;ign again&s;t me. I did not know, but this might deter her from her cruel Intentions. But then I began to con|&s;ider, that in all my Readings I had learnt, the Cruelty of a Woman was hard to be re|mov'd. Therefore I determin'd to declare all to my Uncle, and take his Advice upon't.</P>
<P>When I came home, the Family were at Breakfa&s;t, which was &s;omething earlier than u&s;ual; but I was &s;oon acquainted with the Rea&s;on, for my good Mother-in-law, it &s;eems, did de&s;ign to &s;et out immediately to &s;ee a Friend that was dangerou&s;ly Ill. As this was no new thing, &s;o it alarm'd no one but me; for the good Woman pretended to under&s;tand abundance of things, and was a &s;e|cond <HI>Lady Bountiful.</HI> This Practice, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;he took up to blind the Eyes of my Father
<PB N="181" REF="187">
and Family, that they might not look too narrowly into her Actions. When I was &s;at among 'em, I was ask'd to drink Tea, but I excus'd my&s;elf, by telling 'em I had my Breakfa&s;t already, and look'd my Mother full in the Face; but &s;he regarded me not, having, I &s;uppo&s;e, her Thoughts taken up concerning that Day's Bu&s;ine&s;s. Pray, &s;aid my Uncle, have you broke your Fa&s;t with <HI>Homer,</HI> or <HI>Virgil,</HI> this Morning? Neither, Sir, &s;aid I; I have kept no other Company but <HI>Juvenal</HI> to-day. And why &s;o fond of <HI>Satyr,</HI> Sir? &s;aid my Uncle; that favours of Ill-Nature. True, Sir, I return'd; for I cannot think the Writings of either <HI>Juvenal</HI> or <HI>Petronius,</HI> true Copies of tho&s;e Times: I cannot imagine either the Men, or the Wo|men, &s;uch Mon&s;ters of Iniquity, as tho&s;e Authors repre&s;ent 'em. That, reply'd my Uncle, proceeds from the &s;imple Innocence of thy own Thoughts: But we have In|&s;tances every Day of the Inhumanity, and all other vicious Principles, of either Sex. Are not the <HI>Se&s;&s;ions-Papers</HI> frequently fill'd with barbarous and inhuman Murders, Men of their Wives, and Wives of their Hus|bands and Children? But the crying Sin of Murder is oftner perpetrated by the Women
<PB N="182" REF="188">
than the Men, being their Pa&s;&s;ions are more violent and vindictive, and once enter'd in the Road of Wickedne&s;s, they generally travel to the End on't.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erv'd, my Mother-in-law did not ve|ry well reli&s;h the Di&s;cour&s;e, therefore order'd her Pad to be ready. What, &s;aid my Uncle, does my Si&s;ter go alone? Sure, it will not be improper for a Servant to wait on her, No Sir, reply'd my Mother, I always vi&s;it my Patients alone, for this Rea&s;on; if I &s;hou'd take a Servant with me, they wou'd pre&s;ume on the Benefit the Patient might hope to re|ceive, expecting &s;ome Reward; which to a|void, I never take one with me. Be&s;ide, I am &s;o well known round me Country, that I never met with any In&s;ults from any one. Nay, &s;aid my Uncle, &s;miling, Innocence and Virtue are &s;ufficient Guards; and tho&s;e, I don't doubt, but my Si&s;ter takes along with her. She made him no An&s;wer, but imme|diately mounted, and rode away. As &s;oon as &s;he was gone, I ran up to the Top of the Hou&s;e, where was a Cupola that command|ed a large Pro&s;pect. I perceiv'd, ere &s;he had got a Quarter of a Mile from our Hou&s;e, &s;he met a Countryman, who &s;top'd, and di&s;cours'd together. I had a Per&s;pective in
<PB N="183" REF="189">
my Study, which I had brought up with me, and I cou'd plainly perceive they were very earne&s;t in Di&s;cour&s;e; for I cou'd di|&s;tingui&s;h their Countenances as plain as if they had not been forty Yards from me. Af|ter talking &s;ome time, I ob&s;erv'd my Mother &s;toop down to ki&s;s him (fir&s;t looking about if the Coa&s;t was clear) then turn'd her Hor&s;e's Head, in order to come home again, as I thought. Upon this I immediately went down to acquaint my Uncle with my Morn|ing's Adventure, but was inform'd that my Father and He were &s;hut up together in his Clo&s;et. As they had lock'd the Door, I &s;uppos'd they had no mind to be di&s;turb'd, therefore retir'd, with a Mind in the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion of Thought; for I imagin'd, with Probability enough, that my Uncle was acquainting my Father with what I had in|form'd him of my Mother-in-law.</P>
<P>The Anxiety I felt for what I &s;uppos'd wou'd follow, when all was di&s;cover'd, al|mo&s;t robb'd me of my Under&s;tanding. I took &s;everal ha&s;ty Turns in the Court-Yard, without knowing where I was. At la&s;t it occur'd to my Memory, that I had &s;een my Mother-in-law turn her Hor&s;e's Head, in or|der, as I imagin'd, to come Home, but won|der'd
<PB N="184" REF="190">
at her Delay, for more time was pa&s;t than was nece&s;&s;ary for her Return, at a mo|derate Pace. After waiting, and not &s;eeing her, I began to think &s;he had alter'd her Re|&s;olution, and proceeded on her intended wicked Journey. While I was ruminating on this wretched Affair, my Father and Uncle came to me. My Uncle told me, he had been depo&s;iting a Copy of his Will into my Father's Hands, that if Death &s;hou'd pay him a Vi&s;it unexpectedly, and the Lawyer out of the way, we might, by having Re|cour&s;e to that Copy, know how far I was be|holden to him.</P>
<P>After &s;ome Talk, I took an Opportunity to let my Uncle know I had &s;omething to communicate to him, who was as forward to give me an Occa&s;ion of talking with him. When we were di&s;engag'd from my Father, I acquainted my Uncle with what I had done Ye&s;terday, and this Morning, and what Ob|&s;ervations I had made on my Mother-in-law. Certainly, &s;aid my Uncle, this Woman as far exceeds the la&s;civious Queen of <HI>Naples</HI> in Wickedne&s;s, as &s;he did the re&s;t of her Sex. What think you, Sir, &s;aid I, if we take Hor&s;e, and follow her? It may be we may have the Fortune of finding the Bottom of
<PB N="185" REF="191">
this Intrigue; or at lea&s;t, from thence, know how to form your Behaviour to her and my Father. My Uncle lik'd my Advice &s;o well, that we immediately mounted our Hor&s;es, without letting my Father know of our go|ing. Ere we had gone half a Mile, the Hor&s;e my Uncle rode on, which was one of my Father's, fell a neighing, and was an|&s;wer'd by another in a neighbouring Thicket. As we went forward, the Hor&s;e &s;eem'd wil|ling to go that way. Nay, &s;aid my Uncle, if you have &s;uch a Mind to go out of the Road, I'll humour you for once; it may be, as we are Knights-Errant, we may meet with &s;ome extraordinary Adventure. According|ly, he gave the Hor&s;e the Reins, and he readily enter'd the Cop&s;e. The fir&s;t thing our Eyes encounter'd, was my Mother's Pad ty'd to a Tree; and a little farther, behind &s;ome Shrubs, we di&s;cover'd my good Mother-in-law, and a likely Country-Fellow, very familiar together. You may gue&s;s their Sur|prize at the Sight of us; and ours was al|mo&s;t as great. But my Mother-in-law reco|ver'd her&s;elf the &s;oone&s;t, ran to Hor&s;e, mounted without any Help, and rode off. On my Con&s;cience, &s;aid my Uncle, the ho|ne&s;t Countryman has put Vigour into her
<PB N="186" REF="192">
Lady&s;hip; but I think it a Pity he &s;hou'd go unrewarded, and that he may be the fitter for running, we'll make him &s;omething lighter.</P>
<P>The Man found it was to no Purpo&s;e to attempt running away, as he was on Foot, therefore he approach'd us with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Behaviour, and beg'd our Pardon, imagin|ing we were Strangers to my Father and his Wife; telling us, he hop'd we wou'd not ex|po&s;e a Lady to an injur'd Husband's Re&s;ent|ment. Sir, &s;aid I, I remember you now, notwith&s;tanding your Di&s;gui&s;e, and this is not the fir&s;t time you have &s;een me: Call to mind Ye&s;terday; look in my Face, and then con&s;ider the Injury you have done my worthy Father and his Family. I then in|form'd my Uncle, this was the Per&s;on that met me Ye&s;terday conver&s;ing with the old Woman who was the Letter-Carrier. Then, &s;aid the di&s;guis'd Countryman, I find all is di&s;cover'd! But, if you are Per&s;ons of Ho|nour, you will not oppre&s;s a naked Man. I own my Guilt, nay, will confe&s;s the whole Progre&s;s of it, if you will forgive me: Do but keep it a Secret from the Husband, and I farther vow, never to be guilty that way again.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="193">I am a Gentleman of a good Family, but fallen to Decay. Nece&s;&s;ity fir&s;t drew me in|to this criminal Conver&s;ation with the Lady; tho' I mu&s;t own, notwith&s;tanding our Di&s;pa|rity of Years, I have a tender Regard for her. Youth do not always weigh their Ac|tions, and, for want of Thought, plunge in|to Crimes, we are afterwards a&s;ham'd of. Well, young Man, &s;aid my Uncle, tho' you have injur'd a noble Family, yet, as you &s;eem to repent of your pa&s;t Folly, and if you fulfill your Promi&s;e of revealing this black Corre&s;pondence, I &s;hall freely pardon you, and de&s;ire never to &s;ee you more. I thank you, reply'd the Offender; but I mu&s;t farther beg you to mend your Promi&s;e, by concealing this Affair from all the World. Well, &s;aid my Uncle, notwith&s;tanding this Woman's Wickedne&s;s, which you are a Stranger to, at lea&s;t, the wor&s;t Part of her vile Intentions, I will, with this young Gen|tleman's Con&s;ent (pointing at me) keep this a Secret, till we have Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;he continues in her wicked Cour&s;es. That's all I ask, or can well de&s;ire, &s;aid the Gentle|man in Di&s;gui&s;e, and began as follows.</P>
<P>I was born younger Brother to a numerous I&s;&s;ue, and therefore de&s;ign'd for a Trade&s;|man.
<PB N="188" REF="194">
I was put Prentice to a Mercer in the City, where I learnt little el&s;e but Idlene&s;s and Intriguing; and wronging my Ma&s;ter, by mi&s;pending his Time and Money. You may perceive, Gentlemen, &s;aid he, I intend to be &s;incere, by revealing the Crimes of my fir&s;t &s;etting out in the World. My Fellow-Prentices, I believe, had no more Hone&s;ty than my&s;elf, tho' we were never privy to each others Secrets. Before I had &s;erv'd three Years of my Time, my Ma&s;ter found his Bu&s;ine&s;s in a very declining Condition; as indeed how cou'd it be otherwi&s;e, when he had &s;o many Harpies about him. His Friends, to do him Service, had a Statute of Bankrup|cy taken out again&s;t him, which, in a Year or two turn'd much to his Advantage; for by that means he got rid of his Creditors, and his Servants.</P>
<P>He has &s;ince marry'd a good Fortune, and drives a flouri&s;hing Trade. My Relations pre&s;s'd him to accept of me for the Remain|der of my Time, but he had too ju&s;t an Opinion of me, to comply with their Re|que&s;ts. The Character I bore, was the Ob|&s;tacle that no one of the Trade wou'd enter|tain me; and my Relations perceiving how Matters went, thought it was to no Purpo&s;e
<PB N="189" REF="195">
to think of the Counter for me, therefore prevail'd upon a noble Lord to accept me for his Gentleman, who, out of Regard to my Family, us'd me like one. 'Tis needle&s;s to inform you of the many Intrigues I went thro' while I was a Retainer with this noble Peer; but I &s;hall proceed to the Affair with this Lady.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t time I &s;aw her, was at a neigh|bouring Gentlewoman's, a Relation to our Family, and a Lover of Intrigues. Once every Week &s;he had an A&s;&s;embly, where all the idle People of Fa&s;hion re&s;orted to Game, and make merry. I ob&s;erv'd, &s;he often ca&s;t a favourable Eye upon me, tho' it was &s;ome time before I took any Notice of it. But one Day lo&s;ing a con&s;iderable Sum at <HI>Qua|drille,</HI> I was walking very melancholy alone in the Garden, with troubled Thoughts how to get more; I was interrupted in my Medi|tations by this Lady, who, after much Talk of indifferent Matters, told me, a young Gentleman without Money, made but a di&s;|mal Figure. Come, come, &s;aid &s;he, don't let's lo&s;e your Company for want of a little Tra&s;h. Game&s;ters have various Fortune; &s;he may ca&s;t a more favourable Eye upon you, at your next Trial; therefore there's a
<PB N="190" REF="196">
Hundred Pieces to tempt her; I don't doubt but you will &s;oon be in a Capacity to pay me.</P>
<P>I was &s;o overjoy'd at the Sight of the Mo|ney, that I was too eager for Play, to return her then the &s;uitable Thanks for &s;o great a Favour; but immediately hurry'd among the Game&s;ters, and in le&s;s than an Hour, reco|ver'd my own Money, and a hand&s;om Sum be&s;ide, at <HI>Ba&s;&s;et.</HI> Immediately after, the Company broke up Play, and went to Sup|per. My good Fortune had &s;o much eleva|ted me, that I had no Stomach to eat (for I believe Extremes either way, for &s;ome time, &s;poil the Appetite) therefore I took a Walk in the Garden again, in a far better Temper than when I was there before. I had not walked long, ere I perceiv'd the Lady in the &s;ame Walk; but whether &s;he had conti|nu'd there, or had come after me, I cou'd not tell, for my good Fortune had quite blinded me. However, I went up to her, and thank'd her for the great Favour I had receiv'd; and was fumbling for the Money to repay her. Come, &s;aid &s;he, I am not in &s;uch Ha&s;te, we'll find a Time to be paid; after Supper, no doubt, you'll try the fickle Dame again, therefore keep it, till I demand
<PB N="191" REF="197">
it of you; it's very po&s;&s;ible I may &s;oon &s;tand in as much need of it, as you did &s;ome time ago; till then, you &s;hall be my Banker.</P>
<P>I don't know how much farther we &s;hou'd have proceeded, if we had not been interrupt|ed by &s;ome of the Company; which &s;he per|ceiving coming towards us, gave me a gentle Pre&s;s by the Fingers, and left me. It was not very difficult to gue&s;s, &s;he had a farther Meaning in leaving her Money in my Hands, and I mu&s;t own I was not di&s;pleas'd with the Thoughts of it, for even her Per&s;on did not &s;eem de&s;picable to me; &s;o, on that Score, I &s;hou'd not need much Con&s;traint in my Com|pliance; but the Plea&s;ure of being paid for whatever Trouble I &s;hou'd be at, was the mo&s;t prevailing Argument. The next A&s;|&s;embly I was prevented in making one of the Company, becau&s;e my Lord took me out a Hunting. The Morning following, an old Woman brought me this Letter (pulling one out of his Bo&s;om) which I took from him, by my Uncle's Order. See, <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid he, if it be that ill Woman's Hand; when I a&s;|&s;ur'd him it was, I read the Contents as fol|lows;

<P>I was very well pleas'd with this Billet, and took In&s;tructions where to wait on the La|dy. When Evening came, I went to the Place appointed, where I found her waiting with &s;ome Impatience, as &s;he told me. The old Woman left us alone; and it was not long ere we came to a right Under&s;tanding, which Acquaintance has continu'd upwards of four Years; yet I mu&s;t own to you, her Conver|&s;ation was always agreeable to me, &s;etting a|&s;ide my Intere&s;t.

No, &s;aid I, &s;he has not betray'd you, &s;he was only over-reach'd; tho' now, I believe, &s;he repents of her pa&s;t Actions. Why then, &s;aid <HI>Wigmore,</HI> the Hand of Heaven has pointed her out as a Mark for my Repentance, which I will &s;incerely, for all my pa&s;t Follies.

As we were preparing to read the next Letter, we cou'd perceive running to|wards us, the Per&s;on they were &s;ent to. We were &s;omething &s;urpriz'd at his Return; but when he came up to us (for we &s;tood &s;till to

read the Letters,) he told us (almo&s;t out of Breath with running) that <HI>Burleigh</HI> was com|ing the &s;ame way, and no doubt, for no good, for I know he has been di&s;appointed by my Lady, concerning the receiving of Money, which Di&s;appointment has &s;o much exa&s;pera|ted him, that he re&s;olves to ruin my Lady, tho' I know not by what Means. We per|ceived a Man about a Quarter of a Mile be|hind us, bending his Cour&s;e towards our Hou&s;e, the Foot-Way. My Uncle ask'd what was be&s;t to be done? Why Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> if you will give me Leave to advi&s;e you, I wou'd have you prevent his getting to my Lady's, if po&s;&s;ible, for this Time; who knows what may follow?

Well, &s;aid my Uncle, let it be &s;o. But <HI>Will</HI> tells me, there's &s;ome Letters mi&s;|&s;ing, as you have number'd 'em. Pray what might they contain, if it is not improper to know? Really, reply'd Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> I can't very well remember the Contents, but, in gro&s;s, they were &s;omething too free for a Woman's Pen. I believe, &s;aid my Uncle, if the Story of the <HI>Norman</HI> Monk was true <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Richard,</HI> &s;irnam'd the <HI>Religious,</HI> Grand&s;on to <HI>Rollo</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> was e&s;teem'd a Prince of &s;ingular Piety.

<P>A Monk of <HI>Normandy,</HI> given more to the Fle&s;h than the Spirit, us'd to vi&s;it his Mi&s;tre&s;s by Night, for more Secrecy. One very dark Evening, going to the Ren|dezvous, his Way lying over a Bridge, he fell in, and was drown'd. When his Soul was de&s;cended into the Regions of the Dead, an Angel of Light, and another of Darkne&s;s, had many Strugglings about it; but not agreeing, they re&s;olv'd to put it to the Deci&s;ion of the pious Duke <HI>Richard.</HI> The Angels pleaded like them|&s;elves before their Judge; who, wi&s;ely weighing the Matter, gave Sentence the Body &s;hou'd have its Soul a|gain, and plac'd near the Bridge where he fell from; if he fell in, the black Gentleman &s;hou'd take him for his Perqui&s;ite. The Sentence being put in Execution, the Prie&s;t had learnt more Wit, return'd to his Convent, and there defy'd the Devil, and all his Works. This Affair was &s;o quick in the Di&s;patch, that Duke <HI>Richard</HI> going to the Convent to &s;ee what was become of the Monk, found his Habit all wet with his Fall into the River.</P></NOTE>, and this Woman was in his Condi|tion,

it wou'd not be hard to gue&s;s which Angel wou'd have the Guardian&s;hip of her Lady&s;hip. Come, Sir, &s;aid Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> may be Heaven intends all for the be&s;t. I hope &s;o too, reply'd my Uncle; but I fear, without a Miracle, &s;he'll go the other Way, for all that. However, I'll wait patiently, tho' with little Hope; more for the Peace and Quiet of my Brother and his Family, than any good Will to &s;uch a wicked Woman.</P>
<P>I fear, Sir, &s;aid I, you will not have Time enough for Reflexion now, for <HI>Burleigh</HI> walks at a very great Rate; therefore, the &s;ooner we think how to prevent his getting to the Hou&s;e, the better. Od &s;o! &s;aid my Uncle, that's true; then let us be gone, and leave Mr. <HI>Wigmore</HI> to think of his Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="209">The Hor&s;e-Road to our Hou&s;e was even with the Foot-Road, 'till within a Furlong of the Gate, and then there was no other Way but the common Road.

Why, how now! hone&s;t Friend, &s;aid my Uncle, you &s;eem &s;o much in ha&s;te, that you don't regard your Way. Take care. Re|member the old Saying, <HI>The more Ha&s;te, the wor&s;e Speed</HI>; which has indeed no other Mean|ing, than when People go about things un|lawful, they &s;hou'd not &s;ucceed. If you were a <HI>Roman</HI> now, you &s;hou'd take that for an ill Omen. Why, (reply'd <HI>Burleigh,</HI> &s;omething &s;urlily) what Matter is it to you, or any bo|dy el&s;e, whether I am a <HI>Roman,</HI> or a <HI>Prote|&s;tant,</HI> a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> or a <HI>Muggletonian,</HI> an <HI>Ana|bapti&s;t,</HI> or a <HI>Quaker,</HI> or &mdash; Hold, hold! cry'd my Uncle (&s;miling at his Ab&s;urdity) you &s;eem to be pretty perfect in the Names of many Opinions; and yet I fancy you are a mere Stranger to the Tenets of any of 'em. I am well skill'd in <HI>Phy&s;iognomy,</HI> and to a&s;&s;ure you that I am, you are now going about a black Work, that, let it go which way it will, mu&s;t, of mere Nece&s;&s;ity, bring you into ex|treme Danger and Trouble.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="210">Why, the Devil's in the Gentleman, (re|ply'd <HI>Burleigh,</HI> with a le&s;s-a&s;&s;ur'd Tone than at fir&s;t) or if the Devil is not in you, you mu&s;t be the Devil him&s;elf, or at lea&s;t a Con|juror. Good Friend, return'd my Uncle, I am neither the Devil, nor a Conjuror; and yet I can tell, and foretell; and farther, I a&s;|&s;ure you (looking him full in the Face, which put the other out of Countenance) if you pro|ceed in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, you'll be in &s;ome Dan|ger of a Halter.

whom you go to &s;eek, at home, &s;he's gone to vi&s;it a &s;ick Per&s;on. Return three Days hence, and it may be you will meet with better Suc|ce&s;s than you expect. Whether my Uncle's &s;tern Looks frighted him, or that he really thought him the Devil, I can't tell; but at tho&s;e la&s;t Words, he went back again over the Style, turn'd to give us another Look, and ran back the Way he came, as fa&s;t as his Legs cou'd carry him.</P>
<P>There is more, &s;aid my Uncle, in a guilty Con&s;cience, than a Brace of Evidences. 'Tis not impo&s;&s;ible but this is the &s;ure Means of your Mother's getting rid of this trouble&s;ome Retainer; &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e there will be an annual Pen&s;ion &s;av'd. But what &s;hall we do with this Woman? If &s;he has any Grace left, the be&s;t way of &s;hewing it will be, to hang her&s;elf out of the way; for, I mu&s;t own, I cannot find any other Method to give Peace to the Fami|ly. If we &s;hou'd conceal the&s;e horrible Crimes in Hopes of her Amendment, and &s;he &s;hou'd commit more, we are in &s;ome &s;ort acce&s;&s;ary. But Heaven guide us for the be&s;t! We mu&s;t proceed as Things occurr. When the Groom had taken our Hor&s;es, my Uncle ask'd him, if he knew where his Ma&s;ter was. He an|&s;wer'd, that he rid out pre&s;ently after us, be|ing

inform'd we were taking the Air, and that he took the &s;ame Road as we had done. Sure, &s;aid my Uncle, &s;oftly to me, Provi|dence, by its &s;ecret Workings, intends to re|claim this Woman; or, by its my&s;terious Darkne&s;s, will have her &s;tumble into more Wickedne&s;s; for my Brother's mi&s;&s;ing us mu&s;t be almo&s;t a Miracle. Pr'ythee let's go into the Summer-Hou&s;e, and think on the&s;e wretched Accidents over again.</P>
<P>As we went thro' the Hall, I &s;aw <HI>Betty</HI> at work, and letting my Uncle go before, I in|form'd her, in brief, of the Day's Affair. She &s;eem'd quite dead with my Relation. For God's &s;ake! &s;aid &s;he, if you have any Value for your own Life, get out of her Power; for if &s;he can be &s;o wicked to do as you &s;ay, I fear &s;he'll arrive at the &s;ame Pitch &s;he was at before. I mu&s;t own, continu'd &s;he, my own Life is but of &s;mall Value, and I wou'd free|ly part with it to atone for my pa&s;t Crimes, if it cou'd &s;ave my dear Ma&s;ter's; but, me|thinks, I wou'd not have it made a Sacrifice to a revengeful Woman, who will be &s;ure to rid her Hands of me, becau&s;e &s;he remembers I know her former wicked Intention.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Betty,</HI> &s;aid I, re&s;t contented, you are provided for, if you can like my Uncle's Ser|vice;
<PB N="207" REF="213">
for I have prevail'd upon him to accept you for his Hou&s;ekeeper; therefore, whenever you think fit, you may leave my Lady, and be receiv'd there, without any other Recom|mendation. She was very much rejoic'd at the agreeable News, telling me, &s;uch good For|tune was far beyond her Hopes; yet nothing, &s;he told me, cou'd make her ea&s;y, till I was entirely out of my Mother-in-law's Reach. Well, <HI>Betty,</HI> I return'd, I hope every thing will be determin'd in a few Days, and &s;o fol|low'd my Uncle.</P>
<P>When I came into the Summer-Hou&s;e to him, he ask'd me why I &s;taid? When I in|form'd him, he did not &s;eem pleas'd. It had not been much matter (&s;aid he) <HI>Billy,</HI> whether <HI>Betty</HI> had been let into the Secret &s;o &s;oon; but however, it can't be help'd; I mu&s;t own &s;he knows enough already to be tru&s;ted with every thing. We canva&s;s'd the Matter over &s;everal times, but cou'd make very little of it; and before we cou'd come to any Re&s;olution, <HI>Betty</HI> interrupted us, by bringing a Letter directed to my Uncle, which &s;he &s;aid, the Me&s;&s;enger that brought it told her, it required no An|&s;wer.

<P>That Word, <HI>Affectionate,</HI> at la&s;t, &s;aid my Uncle, puts me out of Conceit with all the re&s;t. However, we'll comply, and beg the Hand of Heaven to guide us.

thought I, is this Woman from <HI>my</HI> dear Mo|ther! And how unhappy has a &s;econd Mar|riage made the Family! My Father took Notice of my Melancholy, asking if I was out of Order?

My Uncle finding he cou'd not make me di&s;&s;ipate that Di&s;content that &s;at on my Countenance, turn'd the Di&s;cour&s;e, and by that brought me out of my Confu&s;ion. Our unea&s;y Conver&s;ation was broke by the Ring|ing of the Bell for Dinner, where I was forc'd to eat again&s;t my Stomach, for fear my Fa|ther &s;hou'd take more Notice of me.</P>
<P>When we had din'd, my Father went to take a Nap, as u&s;ual, which gave my Uncle and me an Opportunity of waiting, without Ob&s;ervation, for Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> with his Letter. About Three in the Afternoon, we &s;aw him approach us, in the &s;ame Di&s;gui&s;e, he had on

All the Hours I have to come, I &s;hall re|member our pa&s;t Crimes with Horror; and I do not in the lea&s;t doubt, but you will do &s;o too, when you reflect what it is to defile the Marriage-Bed, even with a Thought. Do not imagine Fear obliges me to write to you in this manner. No, it is the Re&s;ult of my Thoughts, from an unquiet Con&s;cience. I do not &s;ay it is ea&s;y for
<PB N="212" REF="218">
me to part with you for ever; therefore, as I am a&s;&s;ur'd our guilty Commerce ought to have an End, I intend to-morrow to imbark for another Climate, where I &s;hall have Lei&s;ure to reflect on my pa&s;t Follies, tho&s;e, I confe&s;s, are very numerous: But my Capital Sin was, my Tenderne&s;s for you, and that I fear, will pre&s;s in &s;ometimes, in a manner not plea&s;ing to virtuous Men; which Character, for the future, Heaven a&s;&s;i&s;t me to maintain! So, wi&s;hing you an eter|nal Farewell, I beg you to think on the Advice of your &s;incere Friend in Virtue,</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P>Well, &s;aid my Uncle, as there is, I hope, Truth in it, there's no Want of Rhetoric. But how mu&s;t this be deliver'd to the good Gentlewoman now? It will not be at all proper for either my Nephew, or me, to have a Hand in't, for that may rai&s;e Su&s;pi|cions. Suppo&s;e, reply'd Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> we &s;hou'd give it Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI>: With all my Heart, &s;aid my Uncle, if <HI>Billy</HI> approves on't. I mu&s;t own (I reply'd) that is the &s;afe&s;t Method we can take; but, as the Ca&s;e &s;tands, <HI>Betty</HI> mu&s;t know the Contents, or &s;he will not deliver it. We agreed it &s;hou'd be &s;o, and took our Leaves of Mr. <HI>Wigmore,</HI> with Thoughts of
<PB N="213" REF="219">
never &s;eeing him more. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I cou'd not look upon him without the utmo&s;t Horror, tho' his Guilt was not near of &s;o black a Dye as my Mother-in-law's. And I had &s;uch a Conflict between Rea&s;on and Rage, that I had often Thoughts, young as I was, to call him to a more &s;trict Account; but the Hopes of his going abroad, laid a&s;leep my Re&s;entment. I thought I made but an odd Figure in tamely li&s;tening to the&s;e Inter|views; and told my Uncle afterwards what I had &s;uffer'd. 'Tis well, Boy, &s;aid he, &s;mi|ling, he that conquers his Pa&s;&s;ions, over|comes his greate&s;t Enemy. Even <HI>Scipio</HI> cou'd do no more.</P>
<P>When we came home, we were told my Father was &s;till a&s;leep. I therefore went to find out <HI>Betty,</HI> to give her the Letter, and proper In&s;tructions; fir&s;t acquainting her with the Contents. This, <HI>Betty,</HI> may work upon her. I pray Heaven it may (&s;ays <HI>Betty</HI>) for if &s;he &s;till continues her ill Life, there's no farther Hopes, we mu&s;t di&s;cover all to your Father, to prevent her Ill De&s;igns for the future. While I was talking with <HI>Betty,</HI> my Uncle came to us, and, in a merry man|ner, told her, he &s;hou'd &s;oon have Occa&s;ion for her; nay, he wou'd be &s;ure to manage it,
<PB N="214" REF="220">
that her Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hou'd give her Con&s;ent. But, &s;aid my Uncle, I think I ought to li|mit your Power, for my la&s;t Lady had &s;ome|thing too much. However, I'll take your Word, and <HI>William</HI>'s Bond, for the Perform|ance of Articles. But, to think of more &s;e|rious Matters, continu'd my Uncle, I wi&s;h my Brother cou'd be got out of the way, when his good Lady arrives, that we may have a little more Freedom of Conver&s;ation; for I am not yet fully determin'd what to do with her. Sir, &s;aid I, I know the ready way to &s;end him abroad; only tell him, in &s;uch a Place is a Covy of Partridges, and he and his Man will &s;oon leave us; neither is it a Fal&s;hood, for the other Morning, as I was going to meet the old Woman, a Covy &s;prung up almo&s;t under my Feet. Be it &s;o then, &s;aid my Uncle; and here he comes, get him out of the way as fa&s;t as you can. I then went to my Father, and inform'd him of what I knew; who immediately call'd for his Man, his Dog, and his Gun, and out he went, fir&s;t asking us if we wou'd accompany him, but my Uncle excus'd him&s;elf, and me too.</P>
<P>He had not been gone above half a Hour, but my Mother-in-law came in, with a Coun|tenance full of penitential Sorrow. As &s;oon
<PB N="215" REF="221">
as ever &s;he had an Opportunity, &s;he fell at my Uncle's Feet, and with her Face &s;prinkled with Tears, and a broken Voice, interrupted with Sighs, &s;poke to my Uncle after this man|ner.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I look up? or what &s;hall I do to gain Credit for what I am going to &s;ay? It is but ju&s;tice to &s;u&s;pect the Sincerity of my Words, after what your Eyes have &s;een. But be a&s;&s;ur'd, from this Day, I will take my Date of Virtue. While I have Life, never will I wrong my worthy Husband, even with a Thought. What a gaping Ruin have I a|voided, if you will be prevail'd upon by Re|pentance, to believe me! And to gain more Credit from you, I am oblig'd to let you know, that even <HI>Adultery</HI> is not my greate&s;t Sin. I have, &s;ince you &s;aw me la&s;t, weigh'd well my pa&s;t Crimes, and think there is not &s;uch another wicked Woman breathing. But Heaven, I hope, has in its infinite Stock of Mercy, Forgivene&s;s in &s;tore for a &s;incere Re|pentance. If my Words cannot gain Credit, let your Sword blot out with my Blood, my former Wickedne&s;s! I know I have de&s;erv'd Death, and &s;hall with Satisfaction re&s;ign my &s;elf to your Puni&s;hment; if you can conceal my Crimes, you may term it Accident, or
<PB N="216" REF="222">
whatever you think fit, for I am even weary of this World, made burden&s;ome to me by the Weight of Sin I have laid upon my&s;elf, and wou'd freely make an End of this wretch|ed Being with my own Hands, but that I con&s;ider, I &s;hou'd commit a Crime never to be repented of; and take away all Hopes of Salvation, even in the very Act. Tho' I doubt not but Sorrow, in a few Days, will end my Crimes with my Life, and the &s;ooner that Day comes, the &s;ooner I &s;hall be rid of a terrible Load of Reflexion, even wor&s;e than Death it&s;elf. Here Tears choak'd her Words, and &s;he &s;unk to the Ground, quite overwhelm'd with Sorrow.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, &s;aid my Uncle, rai&s;ing her, if all this Grief is not real, you are an excellent Counterfeit: But I am willing to be|lieve you &s;incere in your Confe&s;&s;ion. And, for my own Part, I'll &s;trive to forget all that's pa&s;t, or think of it as a Dream. But you mu&s;t pardon me, if I am more careful for the future, in ob&s;erving your Actions; for if you &s;hou'd make an ill U&s;e of my Credulity, I &s;hou'd, in &s;ome &s;ort, be guilty. Sir, &s;aid my Mother-in-law, Words are too poor to &s;peak my Thanks, but you &s;hall find my Sin|cerity by my Actions. If in the lea&s;t of all
<PB N="217" REF="223">
my future ones, you find me erring, I &s;hall expect no Admonition from you, but to be deliver'd up to the Hands of Ju&s;tice. And that you may have it in your Power to call me to an Account when you plea&s;e, I &s;hall &s;uc|cinctly tell you which way I de&s;erve the wor&s;t of Deaths. She then related what you have read already, concerning her fir&s;t Husband's Death, but &s;olemnly prote&s;ted, the Poi&s;on was given him by Mi&s;take; for tho' &s;he pro|cur'd it for that Intent, yet &s;he had repented of her wicked De&s;ign; and it being put into the Clo&s;et by Mi&s;take, among &s;ome Cordials, the Nur&s;e gave it her Husband as &s;uch; for &s;he was &s;o far from believing that he came by his Death thro' her Means, that &s;he accus'd the Apothecary's Man, and had follow'd the Accu&s;ation, if &s;he had not found out the Mi&s;|take. I mu&s;t own, I had a guilty Commerce with the Apothecary, who left off making his Vi&s;its after my Husband's unfortunate End. This Proceeding exa&s;perated me &s;o far, that I often wi&s;h'd his Death; and the Devil, to back my Wi&s;hes, brought me acquainted with one <HI>Burleigh,</HI> who us'd to work in the Gar|dens, as Helper to the Gardener, tho' other|wi&s;e a Trooper. He undertook the black Deed; and the Day he fir&s;t knew my Mind,
<PB N="218" REF="224">
he put me pa&s;t the Power to recall it, by ma|king an End of the unfortunate Man; for e|ven as &s;oon as I parted with him, I repented of the Crime; and tho' I &s;ought him all the Day after, to prevent the Deed, I never &s;et Eyes on him, till he came to tell me my Com|mands were obey'd. The Concern I felt at the wicked News, cou'd hardly be expre&s;s'd by Words; but the Wretch, taking hold of my Weakne&s;s, made me comply with every thing he de&s;ir'd, and even to this Day com|pels me to maintain him.</P>
<P>All the while &s;he was relating her horrid Deeds, my Uncle &s;eem'd perfectly Thunder|&s;truck. Who wou'd think, &s;aid he, one Wo|man cou'd be &s;o wicked! Sir, &s;aid &s;he, that is not all. Then &s;he proceeded to tell us of her De&s;igns again&s;t me; but that, &s;aid &s;he, I have long &s;ince repented of, as my wor&s;t of Crimes.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid my Uncle, I hope by this Con|fe&s;&s;ion, we &s;hall find your future Sincerity. But what do you propo&s;e to do with this <HI>Bur|leigh?</HI> It was with &s;ome Difficulty I prevent|ed his coming here to-day. Tho' I am a|maz'd to find you know any thing of him, &s;aid my Mother-in-law, yet I &s;hou'd be much oblig'd to you for your Advice in this Af|fair.
<PB N="219" REF="225">
Well, &s;aid my Uncle, in Hopes of fu|ture Amendment, I have it in my Head to get rid of him, which &s;hall be done to-mor|row, if you'll let me know where to find him. This, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, will double all my Obli|gations to you. I'll give you a Direction in Writing. While &s;he was writing the Direc|tion, <HI>Betty</HI> brought her Mr. <HI>Wigmore</HI>'s Let|ter, which &s;he took and read. Well, &s;aid &s;he, I take Heaven to have a Hand in my Conver&s;ion, for here's another Convert, which very much plea&s;es me, becau&s;e I was troubled before how to make an End with him. She then related what had pa&s;t between 'em. And all her Relations agreed &s;o well with what we knew before, that we thought it a Crime in us, not to believe her Promi&s;es for her future Be|haviour.</P>
<P>A little while after, Word was brought us my Father was come home. How, &s;aid my Mother-in-law, &s;hall I look upon that dear injur'd Face, without betraying my Guilt? When I was envelop'd in Sin, without Thought of Repentance, I cou'd form my Behaviour as I thought fit, without any Difficulty; but now, I cannot tell how to appear before him, without the utmo&s;t Confu&s;ion. Pray, &s;aid my Uncle, let this be the la&s;t Act of Di&s;&s;embling,
<PB N="220" REF="226">
and hide from him the Combat in your Mind. Time will bring you to the Tranquillity of Virtue again.</P>
<P>When my Father came to us, he &s;eem'd very much pleas'd with his Diver&s;ion. What, &s;aid he, you mu&s;t be idling at home, while I am oblig'd to go abroad to procure you a Sup|per. Well, I have got every Man his Bird. 'Tis your Duty, reply'd my Uncle, to pro|vide for your Family; tho' <HI>Billy</HI> and I are, at pre&s;ent, Interlopers. Heyday! cry'd my Fa|ther, What's the matter with <HI>Jane!</HI> (mean|ing his Wife) are your Patients got well upon your Hands, my Dear, that you have not an Opportunity of &s;hewing your Art, you look &s;o melancholy? I am not very well, my Dear, reply'd my Mother, in &s;ome Confu&s;ion. I am &s;orry for that, return'd my Father. But as you can cure other People, I hope you know what's good for your&s;elf. Yes, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I have been troubled with it a great while; 'tis a Heavine&s;s of Heart, but I have taken that I hope will cure it. A Heavine&s;s of Heart, reply'd my Father! there's nothing cures that Di&s;temper like a Gla&s;s or two of good Wine; nay, I think it a general Cure for all Di&s;ea&s;es, and the &s;ooner you take the Remedy, the &s;ooner you'll get rid of your
<PB N="221" REF="227">
Malady. I think, &s;aid my Uncle, that <HI>Phy|&s;ic</HI> is good for us all, therefore let's have it. While the Wine was gone for, my Father &s;eem'd to care&s;s his Wife, which occa&s;ion'd her bur&s;ting into Tears. Pray, &s;aid he, my Dear, tell me what is it di&s;turbs you. In Truth, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I am not very well, and beg leave I may go to Bed; perhaps Re&s;t may help me. So &s;aying, &s;he took leave of the Company, and retir'd. When my Fa|ther had drank a Gla&s;s of Wine, he follow'd her to know how &s;he did, and left my Uncle and me together.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid he, what think you of Affairs? Do you believe &s;he is &s;incere in her Prote&s;tations? Yes, really Sir, &s;aid I, if &s;he does continue it. I am confounded, return'd my Uncle, at what I have heard. If &s;he &s;hou'd be as good as her Word, and let murdering Sorrow make an End of her, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;hou'd be very ea&s;y, notwith&s;tanding her Peni|tence. However, we mu&s;t find out <HI>Burleigh</HI> to-morrow, and get rid of him: And tho' I am a&s;&s;ur'd he de&s;erves an Halter, yet I'll give him a few Pieces to &s;end him into another Part of the World, with all my Heart, and then, &s;ure, &s;he will be ea&s;y. I am of your Opinion, Sir, &s;aid I; I fan&s;y her Decline of
<PB N="222" REF="228">
Years will prevent her &s;eeking another Lover. I do not know that, reply'd my Uncle, that itching Folly never con&s;iders Years; howe|ver, I believe we have nothing to fear from her; but if we &s;hou'd be deceiv'd, I &s;hou'd never forgive my&s;elf. I mu&s;t own, 'tis but &s;eldom Virtue &s;ucceeds Vice, yet &s;uch things have been, and therefore may happen again. We have all the Pro&s;pect we can de&s;ire, in the Confe&s;&s;ion of her Guilt; for as &s;he was igno|rant of our Knowledge of it, &s;he might have &s;par'd the Relation, if &s;he had not intended for the future to amend her Life. We had much Di&s;cour&s;e concerning her, till interrupt|ed by my Father, who told us, his Wife &s;eem'd very much indi&s;pos'd, but he hop'd Re&s;t wou'd re&s;tore her. For my own Part, I freely declare, her Death wou'd certainly have griev'd me; but the Content I &s;hou'd have found from the Family's being intirely out of her Power, wou'd have &s;oon wip'd a|way my Tears.</P>
<P>After Supper, I inform'd <HI>Betty</HI> of all Pa&s;|&s;ages, who&s;e Hopes and Fears agreed with mine, tho' our Hopes, by far, over-balanc'd our Fears.</P>
<P>In the Morning, my Uncle told my Fa|ther, that he and I had a Vi&s;it to make, and
<PB N="223" REF="229">
very po&s;&s;ibly might be oblig'd to &s;tay Dinner. Accordingly, we took Hor&s;e, but in order to find out <HI>Burleigh,</HI> who liv'd in an ob&s;cure Vil|lage three Miles from my Father's. When we arriv'd, we cou'd perceive him running out of the Back-Door, at the fir&s;t Sight of us; and I believe wou'd have got away from us, if his Over-ha&s;te had not often made him fall in the Stubble. When we overtook him, my Uncle ask'd him, why he made &s;uch Ha&s;te from his be&s;t Friends? Why, to tell you the Truth, Sir, &s;aid he, I don't care for conver&s;ing with the Devil, for I can hardly take you for any thing el&s;e. Why, &s;aid my Uncle, were you not afraid of conver&s;ing with him, when you made away with Mr. &mdash; the Apothecary? for Murder is always in&s;ti|gated by the Devil. At the&s;e Words, the Fellow fell a trembling, and cry'd out, <HI>I am a dead Man!</HI> No, &s;aid my Uncle, tho' Murder &s;hou'd never be forgiven, and tho' I am no Devil, yet I have &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in making your E&s;cape; for if you &s;tay Four and Twenty Hours, Ju&s;tice will lay hold on you, and there will be no other Road to get away, but that of the Gallows. In &s;hort, &s;uch a Per&s;on, naming my Mother-in-law, has di&s;cover'd it. Now I wou'd &s;ave
<PB N="224" REF="230">
both your Lives, which cannot be done with|out you fly immediately. Alas! Sir, &s;aid <HI>Burleigh,</HI> whither &s;hou'd I fly? I have no Money, or Friends, or I wou'd be gone with all my Heart. For that, &s;aid my Uncle, I'll take care. Go and provide your&s;elf with what Nece&s;&s;aries you have, and then follow me. We were not long before we mounted, and pur&s;u'd our Journey toward <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>As we rid along, my Uncle ask'd him how he cou'd be &s;o inhuman to murder a Man in cold Blood, and one, very probable, almo&s;t a Stranger to him? Why indeed, reply'd <HI>Burleigh,</HI> I had but little Knowledge of him; but, as to murdering him, I can't give it that Name, for I fairly fought with him; tho' indeed that can't be proved, becau&s;e I am only my own Witne&s;s. What d'ye mean by fighting fairly, cry'd my Uncle; is tak|ing a Man's Life, without any Provocation, to be call'd fair? I can't directly argue the Point with you, Sir, return'd <HI>Burleigh</HI>; but when a Per&s;on has equal Arms to his Oppo|&s;er, and the other fairly runs the risk of Death, I &s;ay it can't be call'd Murder, for he always rode with a Pair of Pi&s;tols, as I did the &s;ame; and I gave him fair Warning; told him, ei|ther he or I had breath'd our la&s;t Hour. 'Tis
<PB N="225" REF="231">
true, he was not very willing to fight, but he found it was to no purpo&s;e; and I mu&s;t own, if he had not, I mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity have kill'd him; but he fir'd both his Pi&s;tols, and mi&s;s'd me; and I, with one of mine, &s;hot him thro' the Throat. After he fell from his Hor&s;e, I drag'd him into the neighbour|ing unfrequented Wood, ty'd his Hor&s;e to a Tree in the &s;ame Wood, and rid home with my own. The &s;ame Day I got leave to be ab&s;ent a few Days, return'd to the Wood, took the Hor&s;e I had left there, and &s;old him at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> with a Pretence I was bound for <HI>Ireland</HI>; &s;o return'd home on Foot. I mu&s;t own, I was too ha&s;ty in executing my La|dy's De&s;ire, for &s;he never peremptorily bid me; but I was willing to get him out of the way, that I might have her all to my &s;elf. I continu'd my Corre&s;pondence for three or four Years, and con&s;tantly receiv'd an annual Pen&s;ion. But when &s;he was about marry|ing, &s;he gave me three Years Allowance to|gether, telling me at the &s;ame time, that what I then receiv'd was the utmo&s;t &s;he cou'd do for me. And, indeed, gave me good Advice. But my Money was &s;oon gone; therefore I apply'd my&s;elf to her a|gain, and almo&s;t forc'd a Sub&s;i&s;tence from
<PB N="226" REF="232">
her, by threatning to declare what &s;he has now done her&s;elf, like a &s;illy Woman as &s;he is. I mu&s;t own, I often threaten'd a young Gentle|man, who I am a&s;&s;ur'd keeps Company with her, of declaring &s;omething might en|danger her Life; but I can a&s;&s;ure you it was only to fright &s;ome Money out of her.</P>
<P>This Talk had brought us to the Town's End. We went directly to my Uncle's Friend, and, by good Fortune, found him at home. My Uncle, in private, declar'd to him the Cau&s;e of this unexpected Vi&s;it; and the Bargain was &s;oon &s;truck for the Di&s;po&s;al of my Friend <HI>Burleigh.</HI> My Uncle at parting, gave him Twenty Guineas, for his own U&s;e; but with a &s;trict Charge to his Friend not to tru&s;t him out of his Sight. And in three Days after we were inform'd, by Letter, that the Ship &s;et &s;ail on her Voyage to <HI>New York.</HI></P>
<P>Now, &s;aid my Uncle, I hope we have laid an excellent Plan for rai&s;ing your Mother's Virtue; and I hope the Super&s;tructure will an&s;wer the Ba&s;is. I am in Heart convinc'd of it, I reply'd. And indeed my Thoughts were now intirely bent on my lovely <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and the Contemplation of her Perfections produc'd a careful Mu&s;ing, which my Uncle
<PB N="227" REF="233">
took notice of. Why how now, <HI>William?</HI> &s;aid my Uncle, What are tho&s;e wi&s;e Thoughts that have ty'd your Tongue up? I hope all Affairs at home are accommodated. Come, let me know the Rea&s;on of your Rumination. Sir, &s;aid I, my Mind was fixt upon the Com|pany we left behind us in your Neighbour|hood. I hope, reply'd my Uncle, the fair <HI>I&s;abella</HI> is not &s;tealing into your Heart? No, Sir, I return'd, I have kept her Image there from the fir&s;t Moment I &s;aw her Face, never to be defac'd by Years, or Misfortune. Why how now! Youth, cry'd my Uncle; is your Heart &s;u&s;ceptible of Love &s;o &s;oon? But I thought as much by your Unea&s;ine&s;s to leave 'em at our la&s;t Vi&s;it: But come, we'll make 'em another to-morrow; for I mu&s;t own, I long to be at home too. Indeed, Sir, &s;aid I, I freely confe&s;s, there lies my Load&s;tone, and turn which way I will, my Inclinations look that way.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid my Uncle, I mu&s;t own, I am not again&s;t your embarking on the Sea of Love, if I was &s;ure you cou'd arrive at your de&s;ired Port, without meeting with Storms in your Voyage. Have you had any Talk with your fair Mi&s;tre&s;s? Sir (&s;aid I) I will never conceal any thing from you, and therefore I
<PB N="228" REF="234">
&s;hall declare all my Proceedings. I then told him the whole Progre&s;s of my amorous Af|fairs. Well, return'd my Uncle, I don't find you have any great Rea&s;on to de&s;pair. Nei|ther, Sir, &s;aid I, can I find any thing to be|get a Hope, e&s;pecially when I think of the implacable Aver&s;ion rooted in the Minds of the Mother and the Aunt, again&s;t Men and Matrimony. Indeed, &s;aid my Uncle, they have both &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons for that Aver&s;ion; the one, from the complicated Humours of an ill-natur'd Husband; and the other, from the Ill-u&s;age of a Man unworthy the Name; which, to beguile the Time, I will relate; I mean, the Story of the Aunt, which I learnt from her own Mouth but the la&s;t time we were there.</P>
<P>When &s;he had &s;carce &s;een Seventeen, &s;he was courted by a Per&s;on remarkable for his good Make, and Addre&s;s, with the Addition of a large Fortune, which in many People, &s;erve only as in&s;trumental to evil Actions. This Man of the World, by the common Wiles, gain'd the Heart of the young Lady, and by his &s;ubtle In&s;inuations, prevail'd upon her to &s;teal from her Relations. His Pretence for it was, his Friends Aver&s;ion to the Match; for indeed his E&s;tate might have commanded,
<PB N="229" REF="235">
as the World goes, a more ample Dowry with a Wife. Blinded by Love, and his Hypocri|&s;y, &s;he comply'd with his De&s;ire, and &s;tole a|way from her Father. When he had got her Per&s;on in his Cu&s;tody, he endeavour'd to gain his Ends without giving the Prie&s;t any Trou|ble; but the Lady, tho' much in Love, ab|horr'd his ba&s;e Intentions, and, by her Re|&s;entment, &s;hew'd the Spark had nothing to hope for from that ungenerous Way. He then got into her good Graces again, by de|claring, his Attempt was only to try her; letting her know at the &s;ame time, how happy he &s;hou'd be with a Woman of &s;uch an impregnable Virtue. In a few Days after this Trial, he marry'd her, and in a Month after the Wedding, told her he wou'd have her go home to her Friends, for he expected his Wife out of the Country, who was of &s;uch a violent Temper, every thing was to be fear'd from her Rage.</P>
<P>The poor Lady was dumb thro' A&s;toni&s;h|ment, and many times fancy'd he had a mind to try her Temper, and gave him to under|&s;tand as much. Well Madam (&s;aid the ba&s;e Wretch) I am re&s;olv'd to make the Matter as plain as I can to you. Here, <HI>John!</HI> (cal|ling to one of his Servants) this, Madam,

&s;aid he, is the good Man that gave us a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to go to Bed together, and he is come to take his Leave of you, being to attend a Gentleman of my Acquaintance in his Tra|vels, in the Quality of his Footman; and I believe he is &s;o far from being a Churchman, that he never was in a Church in his Life. I hope, &s;aid the Fellow, your Honour will par|don my contradicting you in that, for I have been many a Day in Twenty, one after ano|ther. The poor Lady too &s;oon found the Truth of her Misfortune; and her Rage and De&s;pair, vented in the bittere&s;t Reproaches, had no Effeft on the inhumane Brute. But, in&s;tead of giving her any Comfort (finding &s;he made no Ha&s;te in leaving him) left her in &s;ole Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lodging he had taken for that Purpo&s;e, where &s;he was forc'd to part with every thing &s;he had of Value, to &s;upport her in common Nece&s;&s;aries of Life; and, if her careful Father had not found her out, was re&s;olv'd to part with Life, to put an End to her Shame and Misfortunes. The old Gentle|man took her home; and, to comfort her, gave her his Word he wou'd forget her Un|happine&s;s, being well a&s;&s;ur'd of her hone&s;t In|tentions. And this is the Cau&s;e of the Aunt's Aver&s;ion to Men and Matrimony.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="237">I &s;hall own, Sir, &s;aid I, I can't well blame the Re&s;olution &s;he has taken. I mu&s;t declare, I wonder how &s;uch barbarous Notions can en|ter the Minds of Men! and if there were not In&s;tances of it every Day, I &s;hou'd think &s;uch Relations Fables. How is it po&s;&s;ible that the Nature of Men &s;hou'd be &s;o very different! Every kind of the Brute Creation are much the &s;ame; but Man &s;ympathizes with every Degree of 'em; and are full as va|rious. A Man had better not be, than to be born with &s;uch Appetites; and the Dignity of his Figure only makes him the greater Mon|&s;ter. I own (reply'd my Uncle) your good Sen&s;e, at &s;o early an Age, gives me the ut|mo&s;t Contentment; and tho' Philo&s;ophy may be learnt without practi&s;ing, yet I believe I have nothing to fear from your Conduct.</P>
<P>It was late in the Evening before we came home; and we were inform'd by my Father, that his Wife's Indi&s;po&s;ition increa&amp;'d. My Father &s;eem'd &s;o very much concern'd, that he was not very inqui&s;itive about the Journey we had made that Day. We &s;ympathiz'd with him. However, my Uncle inform'd him, that we intended to be gone in the Morn|ing early; and all his Intreaties cou'd not prevail upon him to &s;tay longer. Well then,
<PB N="232" REF="238">
&s;aid my Father, &s;ince you will go, I wou'd have you take Leave of my Wife to-night; which was agreed to. A Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent to her, to know if it was proper to &s;ee us; and &s;he &s;ent Word &s;he &s;hou'd take it kindly. When we came into the Room, my Uncle and I &s;at on each &s;ide her Bed, and neither of us &s;poke for &s;ome Moments. At la&s;t, my Mother-in-law broke Silence. Well, Sir, &s;aid &s;he to my Uncle, has your Journey &s;uc|ceeded, and am I to number this Day's Work among the many other Obligations I have to your Virtue? Madam, reply'd my Uncle, every thing has fell out, I hope, according to your De&s;ire; for, I am fully per&s;uaded, <HI>Burleigh</HI> will never come more to interrupt your growing Quiet. He then related the Tran&s;actions of the Day to her. Well then, &s;aid my Mother, my Mind's at re&s;t, and I hope Heaven will pardon me, as you have done; 'tis all I have now to do, to gain it, for I find I am not long to continue in this World, for the Wounds my Virtue, tho' a Conqueror, has receiv'd, in the &s;harp Com|bat with overgrown Vice, I find will not be heal'd but by the Hand of Death; therefore, when you hear I am no more, bury my Fail|ings with my Body, in my Grave, nor never
<PB N="233" REF="239">
think of me, but as a &s;incere and humble Pe|nitent.</P>
<P>The Behaviour of my Mother-in-law, brought Tears into my Eyes, which &s;he ob|&s;erv'd with a Tenderne&s;s I had never perceiv'd in her before. Dry thy Tears, my Child, &s;aid &s;he; thy &s;oft Di&s;po&s;ition overwhelms me with Confu&s;ion. If I &s;urvive, I beg you will look upon me as thy own Mother, for my Actions &s;hall ever declare me &s;o. And if Death relea&s;es me from this trouble&s;ome World, remember me as &s;uch in every thing, but thy Grief. I cou'd not return any An&s;wer, my Heart was &s;o overburden'd with Sorrow; which &s;he perceiving, flung her Arms about my Neck, pre&s;t me to her Cheeks, and we mingled our Tears together. We continu'd in this &s;orrowful Employment till my Father came in and interrupted us. Come, &s;aid he, no more Grieving; by the Grace of God, a few Days will cha&s;e away this Indi&s;po&s;ition; and then we'll come and make my Brother a Vi&s;it. I mu&s;t own, I parted with her in the utmo&s;t Sorrow, for I found my Tenderne&s;s in|crea&s;e every Moment; and if the Thoughts of &s;eeing my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had not &s;tole into my Memory, I &s;hou'd have been incon&s;olable in this Parting: But every thing mu&s;t give

way to Love. We al&s;o took Leave of my Father over-night, that Ceremony might give us no Hindrance in the Morning. When the Veil of Ob&s;curity was drawn, to let in the chearful Beams of the Sun, my Uncle and I mounted, and pur&s;u'd our Journey. My Uncle, to make the Way le&s;s tedious, told me many plea&s;ant Stories; which gave me &s;o much Satisfaction, that we got home before I thought we were half way.</P>
<P>After Dinner, my Uncle ask'd me if I had Stomach enough to pay a Vi&s;it to the Ladies? I told him, nothing cou'd be more agreea|ble to me. We were &s;oon ready, and &s;oon on Hor&s;eback. When we arriv'd, we found a great many Female Vi&s;itors, and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> pre|&s;iding over the Tea-Table, as u&s;ual: I ob|&s;erv'd a Blu&s;h in her Cheeks, when &s;he fir&s;t &s;aw me; which I interpreted in my Favour at fir&s;t, as Love's a Flatterer. Yet &s;he took &s;o little Notice of me, during the re&s;t of the Day, that my Unea&s;ine&s;s was very great. The Company &s;taid Supper; and <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> to compleat my Di&s;content, took all Occa&s;ions to avoid me. One Lady I took particular Notice of, a Woman about Thirty. She &s;eem'd to have a langui&s;hing Sweetne&s;s in her Countenance, that di&s;cover'd a Temper with|out
<PB N="235" REF="241">
any Gall. She often took notice of my Sadne&s;s, without the Heed of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> or the re&s;t of the Company. I have heard, &s;aid &s;he, many Commendations of this young Gentleman's Under&s;tanding, which makes me imagine &s;omething extraordinary has put him out of Humour. This Speech, I mu&s;t own, put me into &s;ome Confu&s;ion; and I thought my&s;elf under the Nece&s;&s;ity of making a Re|ply; but my Uncle gave me time to recover, by an&s;wering for me. A Man, &s;aid he, mu&s;t have a fine Time on't, to give Proofs of his Under&s;tanding among &s;o many Female Tat|lers (begging this Lady's Pardon, bowing to the Stranger) but yet I think <HI>Billy</HI> has made his plain, by holding his Tongue. Women have not Souls capable of edifying by his Di&s;|cour&s;e. And I am &s;ure there is nothing learnt by their eternal Clacks, except it gives us an Idea of a Perpetual Motion. We are &s;ure of your good Word, reply'd the Aunt. Yet I am as much concern'd as you are, if the young Gentleman has met with any thing to put him out of Humour. Perhaps, reply'd the Stran|ger Lady, he had rather be in Company more &s;uitable to his Years. I think <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;hou'd entertain him. Really Madam, return'd <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> I am not of your Opinion; I have left
<PB N="236" REF="242">
off Play-things for &s;ome time, therefore I ima|gine I &s;hall be as dull Company for him, as he will be for me. You are a little too free with the young Gentleman, return'd the Mo|ther; and, in general, you are all too hard upon him. I have done, Madam, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay no more, and ask Par|don, if I have offended him. Their Di&s;|cour&s;e was interrupted, by the &s;trange Lady's Husband's Entrance, who came to fetch her home. When &s;he was gone, my Uncle ask'd who &s;he was, for, to the be&s;t of his Remem|brance, he had never &s;een her before. There is &s;omething very extraordinary in that Lady's Fortune, &s;aid the Aunt; and if it were not &s;o late, <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;hou'd read her Story, wrote by her Husband, which &s;he has procur'd a Copy of from the Lady's Original. Why then reply'd my Uncle, with <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Leave, we'll tre&s;pa&s;s upon the Time, 'tis Moonlight, and we &s;hall find our way home without a Candle. I am ready to &s;atisfy you, return'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> if I once receive my Mother's Com|mands. My Commands are at your Service, reply'd the Mother. Upon that <HI>I&s;abella</HI> went out, and return'd immediately, with a Paper in her Hand. This true Story, &s;aid &s;he, is call'd, by the Per&s;on that wrote it,</P>

<HEAD>ELEANORA OR, THE WILLING CUCKOLD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ELEANORA,</HI> was Daughter to a weal|thy Citizen of <HI>London</HI>; but, having ma|ny Children, he cou'd not give her a Fortune equal to her Merit. She had all the Advantage of Education, even for one of a higher Sta|tion; and there was nothing wanting, but Grandeur, to make her the fine&s;t Woman in the World. A Phy&s;ician, of good Practice, fell in Love with her, and declaring his Pa&s;|&s;ion to her Father, gain'd his Con&s;ent to ad|dre&s;s his Daughter. But, like an indulgent Parent, con&s;idering the Bargain he was driv|ing was to la&s;t for Life, frankly told him, if he cou'd not gain his Daughter's Heart, there was no Advantage to be expected from his Con&s;ent; for he valu'd the Repo&s;e of his Children beyond every thing el&s;e in this World. The Doctor approv'd of his Senti|ments,
<PB N="238" REF="244">
therefore endeavour'd to gain the Af|fection of the young Lady. As he was a Man of a tolerable Per&s;on and hand&s;ome Ad|dre&s;s, he gain'd upon her to receive the Pro|po&s;als of Marriage without any Reluctance.</P>
<P>The Nuptials were &s;olemniz'd, and, in all Appearance, they bid fair for a very happy Couple. Some Years pa&s;s'd with an uninter|rupted Series of Contentment. In the Sum|mer-Sea&s;on, when Bu&s;ine&s;s wou'd permit, he with his Family, wou'd retire into the Coun|try. In their rural Neighbourhood liv'd a Gentleman of a great E&s;tate, who &s;eeing <HI>Elea|nora</HI> by Accident in her Garden, fell de&s;pe|rately in Love with her. <HI>When the Gifts of Fortune are thrown upon an Unde&s;erver, they only &s;erve to incourage Ba&s;ene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This Gentleman was re&s;olv'd to enjoy the virtuous Lady on any Hazard; and his fir&s;t Step was to get acquainted with the Husband, which was no very difficult Point to gain; it was ea&s;y to feign an Indi&s;po&s;ition, and the Phy&s;ician gains as much by the Sound, as the Di&s;eas'd; imaginary Di&s;tempers out-number the real ones. The Gentleman was liberal in his Fees to the Doctor; and the Doctor had Under&s;tanding enough in his Profe&s;&s;ion to know, that he receiv'd his Money for no|thing;
<PB N="239" REF="245">
but that was his Cur&s;e, the Cur&s;e of Avarice.</P>
<P>The love&s;ick Gentleman took all Occa|&s;ions to vi&s;it the Doctor at his own Hou&s;e, where he had many Opportunities of conver|&s;ing with the Lady, and the Charms of her Under&s;tanding were as &s;trong as tho&s;e of her Per&s;on: But then, to freeze his Hopes, he found her one of an impregnable Virtue. He had oft declar'd his Pa&s;&s;ion to her, and &s;he as oft threaten'd to acquaint her Husband; but her Threats were of no U&s;e, for he was too powerful, and too much in Love, to fear any thing but her Scorn. When the Lady found no U&s;age wou'd make him forbear his Vi&s;its or Addre&s;&s;es, re&s;olv'd never to appear when ever he came; but this only added Fuel to the amorous Fire, and render'd him the more impatient.</P>
<P>Burning in this unlawful Flame, he was re|&s;olv'd by Force to po&s;&s;e&s;s her, &s;ince every other way fail'd. He found means to cor|rupt her Maid, for few Servants are Proof again&s;t Gold; and being inform'd by her, that the Doctor was oblig'd to attend a No|bleman, his Patient, to the <HI>Bath,</HI> he deter|min'd that very Night, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the treacherous Maid, to execute his vil|lainous
<PB N="240" REF="246">
De&s;ign. In <HI>Eleanora</HI>'s Bed-chamber was a Clo&s;et, that open'd on the In&s;ide with a Spring-Lock, into which the Gentleman was convey'd, di&s;guis'd, by the Servant, who took the Key in her Pocket. When the in|nocent Lady came to go to Bed, which &s;he did early, in the Ab&s;ence of the Husband, &s;he inquir'd for the Key of her Clo&s;et, to go to her Devotion, as u&s;ual; but the Maid, af|ter hunting a great while, told her &s;he cou'd not find it; therefore mu&s;t &s;end for the Smith in the Morning. The Gentleman has oft|times declar'd &s;ince, that the Fervency of her Devotion had almo&s;t made him forgo his ra&s;h Attempt. But Love prov'd too power|ful for tho&s;e pious Thoughts. As &s;he was undre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to go to Re&s;t, her Hus|band return'd. She expre&s;s'd a great deal of Satisfaction for his &s;udden and unlook'd-for coming back; but it is ea&s;y to gue&s;s what the Gentleman in the Clo&s;et felt at &s;o cruel a Di&s;appointment; and he &s;ometimes thought that Heaven had heard her Prayers, and pre|vented his wicked Intention. The Doctor told his Wife, that he had met his Patient upon the Road, who came to Town on Pur|po&s;e to be near him and his own Apotheca|ry, for his Advice. After &s;ome trivial Talk,
<PB N="241" REF="247">
he call'd for Supper; but the Maid, who &s;tood upon Thorns, de&s;ired that he might go and &s;up in the Parlour, that &s;he might have an Opportunity of conveying the baffled Lov|er out of the Hou&s;e: But the Doctor prov'd ob&s;tinate, and &s;wore he wou'd &s;up there, and no Per&s;ua&s;ions cou'd alter his Re&s;olution. Therefore Supper was brought up, and the Lover and the Maid wi&s;h'd him heartily choak'd. Among other Di&s;cour&s;e, the Doc|tor ask'd his Wife, Why &s;he appear'd &s;o &s;trange to the Squire? meaning our clo&s;eted Lover. You &s;hou'd con&s;ider, my Dear, add|ed he, he's one of my be&s;t Patients, and in all Probability will continue &s;o; for he, like my Lord, has no other Di&s;ea&s;e than what's form'd by Fancy, which is a Companion cer|tain for Life. The Doctor &s;aid &s;o much up|on the Subject, that <HI>Eleanora</HI> at la&s;t confe&s;s'd his unlawful Solicitations. And &s;he further added, the Way to be freed from his wicked Addre&s;&s;es, was never to come into his Sight. Ay, but my Dear, reply'd the Husband, if that be his Motive of vi&s;iting us, I &s;hall lo&s;e my Patient, when he perceives the Deprivation of your Company.</P>
<P><HI>Eleanora</HI> was &s;omething &s;urpriz'd at his manner of Rea&s;oning, imagining he would
<PB N="242" REF="248">
re&s;ent it, as a Man of Honour ought. The Husband perceiving her Confu&s;ion at his un|expected An&s;wer, cry'd, No, no, my Dear, I am very well &s;atisfy'd in your Virtue, and that no Temptation will be &s;trong enough to overcome it. Therefore I de&s;ire, whenever the Squire comes, you wou'd appear as you were wont, and only make a Je&s;t of his Pa&s;&s;ion; I'll warrant you, nothing that he can &s;ay will hurt your Features, or deaden your Com|plexion: Therefore, pr'ythee, let him &s;ay what he will; as long as I am &s;atisfy'd, you need not have any further Regard. <HI>Eleanora</HI> was confounded with the Sentiments of her Husband, plainly telling him, that Avarice had blinded him, and the prattling World wou'd &s;oon declare her guilty, if the Squire continu'd his Vi&s;its; and if your own Ho|nour will not prompt you to put a Period to this dangerous Corre&s;pondence, I hope, &s;aid &s;he, my Quiet will be of &s;ufficient Force with you. The Doctor &s;till prov'd ob&s;tinate, and in&s;i&s;ted upon her receiving the Squire with favourable Looks. He being of an ob&s;ti|nate pa&s;&s;ionate Temper, &s;he &s;eem'd, at la&s;t, con&s;enting to his Will, hoping Time wou'd, &s;ome way or other, put an End to &s;uch an Affair.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="249">The Gentleman in the Clo&s;et, tho' unea&s;y at his Confinement, yet receiv'd &s;ome Con&s;o|lation in the Sentiments of the Husband, and conceiv'd Hope even of &s;ucceeding in his Wi&s;hes, thro' the Doctor's Avarice, and bad Principles. All his Unea&s;ine&s;s was, now, how to get away undi&s;cover'd; his being near the Object of his Wi&s;hes, gave him no Content|ment, when his Ideas gave her to the Arms of a dull in&s;ipid Husband. The Clo&s;et where he was, look'd into the Garden, and being a Ground-Floor, he got out with little Diffi|culty; but, getting over the Garden-Wall, a Ma&s;tiff-Dog belonging to the Hou&s;e, &s;eiz'd him by the Leg, and pull'd him down again; and having no Arms about him, but what were prepar'd for Love, it was with much Diffi|culty and Danger he e&s;cap'd the Ma&s;tiff's Fury.</P>
<P>When he came home, he was oblig'd to &s;end for a Surgeon, for the Dog had bit him in &s;everal Places, and a rea&s;onable Per&s;on wou'd imagine the Smart of his Wounds might have cur'd the Pain in his Heart; but he was more in Love than ever. The Cure of his Hurts kept him at home much longer than his impatient Soul wou'd permit, which retarded his Cure. The Doctor vi&s;ited him
<PB N="244" REF="250">
every Day, and never without a Fee; and no doubt, in his Heart, he wi&s;h'd when he was cur'd of this Hurt, to meet with another &s;uch, the fir&s;t time he went abroad. Tho' the Gentleman had form'd a Story, far from the Road of Truth, yet the Doctor told him, he did not doubt, but he met with the Ac|cident in pur&s;uing &s;ome Love Intrigue.</P>
<P>One Day, when they were together in the Squire's Garden, pretty well warm'd with the Juice of the Grape, he &s;poke to him after this manner: Sir, I &s;tand in very great need of your Advice, without pre&s;cribing to the Apo|thecary. I am &s;ick, I own, but my Di&s;|ea&s;e lies in the Mind. I have long langui&s;h'd for a beautiful Lady, that if I do not enjoy, I mu&s;t &s;eek for my Contentment in the Grave, for there is nothing el&s;e in this World, can give me Ea&s;e. This Charmer is marry'd, and I believe &s;trictly virtuous. I &s;hall con|ceal the Name, till I hear your Advice and Sentiments on this Occa&s;ion; but, by the way, before you &s;peak, I am willing to give 500 <HI>l.</HI> to compleat the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and 20 <HI>l.</HI> every time I have the Enjoyment of the Lady. The Doctor did not take a long time to con&s;ider the Propo&s;al, but made him this An&s;wer: Sir, were it my own Ca&s;e, I
<PB N="245" REF="251">
&s;hou'd not long demur upon it, for, I can a&s;&s;ure you, I &s;hou'd take the Money; and tho' it might &s;eem &s;trange in the Eyes of the World, yet, in my own private Opinion, there is no Crime in't. What the wor&s;e is a Woman for being enjoy'd by more than her Husband, e&s;pecially with his Con&s;ent; for I believe there are but few guiltle&s;s without it, and commit the Sin, if it be one, without any Profit.</P>
<P>The Gentleman finding the Doctor pretty willing in &s;uch an Affair, told him the whole Truth, and that it was his Wife who&s;e Eyes had wounded him. To deal as freely with you, reply'd the Doctor, I imagin'd as much; for my Wife has been complaining to me of your criminal Addre&s;&s;es, as &s;he calls 'em; and I find (not as I have put it directly to her) that there is no Hope in gaining her, know|ingly, to con&s;ent; or perhaps if &s;he were willing, I &s;hou'd not be ea&s;ily brought to treat about the Matter: But I &s;uppo&s;e if it were &s;o, I &s;hou'd never have heard of the Affair. Well then, &s;aid the Squire, &s;ince you are willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, I'll give you my Word and Honour, every Article I have mention'd to you, &s;hall be made good; and let us begin as &s;oon as you plea&s;e. Hold,
<PB N="246" REF="252">
Sir, reply'd the Doctor, we are now driving a Bargain, I am well a&s;&s;ur'd you wou'd not apply to me, if you cou'd get your Bu&s;ine&s;s done without me; therefore I am re&s;olv'd you &s;hall come to my Terms, or you &s;hall never &s;ee my Wife more. &mdash; Fir&s;t, you &s;hall enter into Bonds, never to di&s;clo&s;e the Secret to any Per&s;on: Next, you mu&s;t make the 500 <HI>l.</HI> a 1000 <HI>l.</HI> for the fir&s;t time; for how do I know but you may repent your Bargain, after Enjoyment? for I am convinc'd, Ex|pectation exceeds Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our Wi&s;hes: And for the &s;econd time, 100 <HI>l.</HI> the third 50 <HI>l.</HI> and the fourth 20 <HI>l.</HI> and &s;o to continue.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, eager as he was to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Lady, was &s;urpris'd at his Propo&s;al; but, as his Pa&s;&s;ion exceeded his Rea&s;on, &s;oon a|greed to the mention'd Articles. But the Difficulty was, how to have 'em drawn with Secrecy; but the Doctor &s;oon &s;olv'd that, by telling him, he wou'd draw up the Bond him|&s;elf, and the Squire's Servants might &s;ign it, without knowing the Contents. The fir&s;t 1000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;hould be brought in Specie; and &s;o the re&s;t, as they &s;hould become due. The Gentleman was too much blinded with Love, to &s;top at any thing. The next Day the Bond of Secrecy was &s;ign'd, with the Penalty of
<PB N="247" REF="253">
3000 <HI>l.</HI> and the Night after that, was agreed on for the fir&s;t Time, when he &s;hou'd take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all he de&s;ir'd. In the Interim, the Doctor had many Di&s;cour&s;es with his Wife, upon the Levity of Women, and that the Crime of Adultery was only as People were pleas'd to form it to them&s;elves. The poor innocent Lady little imagin'd the ba&s;e De&s;ign that was hatch'd again&s;t her, and on|ly begg'd her Husband wou'd cea&s;e &s;uch Di&s;|cour&s;es, that but ill agreed with her Senti|ments.</P>
<P>The better to carry on the Contrivance, the Squire had not made one Vi&s;it at the Doc|tor's, &s;ince the Night he was confin'd in the Clo&s;et; and the poor Lady, far from Ill-Nature, was not di&s;pleas'd that he had any thing to hinder his trouble&s;ome Vi&s;its. When the fatal Evening came, the Doctor took care in conveying the Gentleman with his 1000 <HI>l.</HI> into the Clo&s;et, unperceiv'd by any; and that his Wife &s;hou'd not have an Occa|&s;ion for any thing that was there, had order'd all her Female Geers out two Days before, with this Rea&s;on, That he &s;hou'd want that Place intirely to him&s;elf, for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Bed-time came, and the poor Victim was laid in Sheets, the Emblem of her Innocence,
<PB N="248" REF="254">
ready for the Sacrifice of unlawful Love. The ba&s;e-&s;pirited Husband took an Occa&s;ion of putting out the Candle, and di&s;mi&s;s'd the Maid. Upon the In&s;tant, the expecting Lover took his Place, and the Doctor pru|dently and decently retir'd to his Clo&s;et. I can't give the Reader his Thoughts of what was doing; but 'tis rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, even the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his <HI>Mammon,</HI> cou'd not quite bani&s;h &s;ome &s;curvy Ideas. The Gentleman, after revelling &s;everal Hours in guilty Joys, retir'd into the Clo&s;et, as was a|greed on, dre&s;s'd him&s;elf, and went home, with the Help of his Cuckold; who, to fa|vour his Retreat, pretended he heard &s;ome Noi&s;e in the Hou&s;e. Every thing thus &s;uc|ceeded as the Wretch de&s;ir'd; who, notwith|&s;tanding his Guilt, went to Bed, and &s;lept as found as unpolluted Innocence.</P>
<P>The next Day he made a Vi&s;it to the Squire, where he applauded his own Wit, for his nice Conduct in the Affair: But his chief Rea|&s;on of vi&s;iting the Lover, was to know if he de&s;ign'd another Vi&s;it that Night; and was much rejoic'd to find the Gentleman as eager, as he was willing. In &s;hort, the Gentleman went much oftner than his Fortune wou'd permit; and the Cuckold wore his Antlers all
<PB N="259" REF="255">
over Gold. But tho' the Gentleman's Love was not dead, yet the Edge was &s;o far taken off, that he began to rea&s;on with him&s;elf, and therefore went not &s;o often as the Doctor de|&s;ired; he reproach'd him with his Decay of Pa&s;&s;ion for his Wife; and the Gentleman wanted to be upon better Terms. In &s;hort, there had like to have been a Breach between 'em: For the Doctor wou'd not bate an Ace of his fir&s;t Price, imagining it wou'd be un|dervaluing the Goods in Trade. The Gen|tleman told him, tho' he lov'd his Wife as much as ever, yet he &s;hou'd be oblig'd to make le&s;s frequent Vi&s;its, or his Fortune wou'd be much impair'd. The Husband was much chagrin'd at it, but made him&s;elf ea&s;y with this Reflexion, that if his Love continu'd, as he had no Rea&s;on to think the contrary, his Prudence wou'd give way to it. The Lover imagin'd, if he cou'd di&s;clo&s;e the Intrigue to the Lady, &s;he wou'd, out of a ju&s;t Re&s;entment, continue the Corre&s;pondence more to his Ad|vantage. He therefore laid a Plot to get the Husband out, when he was expecting the happy Moment in the Clo&s;et. Accordingly, at the Time, a Servant came with a Coach and Six, to bring the Doctor to my Lord&mdash; his Patient formerly, who was taken dange|rou&s;ly
<PB N="250" REF="256">
and &s;uddenly ill. He had ju&s;t time to &s;tep into the Clo&s;et, and to inform the Lover he &s;hou'd be back in two Hours; therefore de&s;ired him to have Patience till that Time. As he went out, he de&s;ir'd his Wife not to go to Bed, till he came back.</P>
<P>The Gentleman had taken care he &s;hou'd not return &s;o &s;oon as he imagin'd, for he had given Directions to his Servants to turn him out upon a Common, Fifteen Miles from his own Hou&s;e, in the middle of a dark Night. So there we &s;hall leave him, to his Di&s;ap|pointment and inward Vexation; and go home to the Doctor's Hou&s;e again. His Wife &s;at up beyond the expected Time, and would have &s;at up much longer, if the Maid, to go to Bed her&s;elf, had not per&s;uaded her, that my Lord might be in very great Dan|ger, and con&s;equently her Ma&s;ter oblig'd to attend him. The Wife, upon the&s;e Per&s;ua|&s;ions, went into her Bed-Chamber, and di&s;|mi&s;s'd her Female Attendant; but not being quite ea&s;y in her Mind, concerning her Brute of a Husband, &s;at down to read; which the Gentleman perceiving, imagin'd &s;he wou'd be le&s;s &s;urpris'd while there was Light, than if he &s;hou'd make his Di&s;covery in the Dark, therefore open'd the Door &s;oftly, and came
<PB N="251" REF="257">
out of the Clo&s;et. His fir&s;t Appearance had &s;o much affrighted her, that &s;he had not Power to &s;peak, or cry out. Madam, &s;aid the Gentleman, don't be &s;urpriz'd at this un|expected and un&s;ea&s;onable Vi&s;itation; for, on my Honour, I mean you no Injury; and, to open your Eyes, and prepare you for what I &s;hall &s;ay, I was conducted hither by your Husband. He then proceeded, and acquaint|ed her with every Circum&s;tance of their A|greement. The griev'd Lady had not Strength enough to hear it out, but fell in a Swoon up|on the Bed where &s;he &s;at. The Gentleman was truly concern'd for this Accident, and us'd all the Means in his Power, to bring back her Sen&s;es again: But when her Under|&s;tanding was re&s;tor'd, her Lamentations, Sighs, and Tears, were beyond Expre&s;&s;ion moving. She &s;eem'd re&s;olv'd to receive no Con&s;olation, but look'd upon him as the hateful Executioner of her Honour. Madam, &s;aid the Gentleman, if I cou'd have imagin'd you wou'd have felt this Injury &s;o &s;harply, I never wou'd have committed it; and I &s;hall ever repent, to the la&s;t of my Life, the Sorrow I have given to a Woman of &s;uch impregnable Virtue. But it is all owing to the Ba&s;ene&s;s of that Wretch, who is no longer
<PB N="252" REF="258">
worthy to be call'd your Husband. If you can bury the Remembrance of what is pa&s;t, be a&s;&s;ur'd, for the future, I &s;hall be a Friend to your Virtue, and never once attempt any thing injurious to your Honour. After Death (reply'd the Lady, in Tears) 'tis too late for Phy&s;ic, I am for ever mi&s;erable; and, to ag|gravate my Sorrows, I am even ty'd up from re&s;enting, as I ought, this irreparable Injury; for tho' the Ba&s;ene&s;s of my Husband might cancel every Matrimonial Tie, yet I have a Soul that tells me, all my Re&s;entments will be to grieve in Silence, till Death relea&s;es me from all my Pain.</P>
<P>All the Gentleman's Endeavours to &s;ooth her Sorrows, prov'd vain; and he took his Leave of her, with a &s;olemn Re&s;olution ne|ver to have any Corre&s;pondence with the hate|ful Husband more; &s;incerely repenting for his Follies pa&s;t, and in the utmo&s;t Grief it was no farther in his Power to redre&s;s her Inju|ries.</P>
<P>The next Day, about Noon, the <HI>Willing Cuckold</HI> return'd, loaden with Cur&s;es for the Trick put upon him; and tho' his Wife en|deavour'd to conceal her Sorrows, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible; for her Tears &s;tole from her Eyes, pur&s;uing one another, and Sighs heav'd
<PB N="253" REF="259">
in her Brea&s;t, as if every one intended to be her la&s;t Breath. The Husband &s;oon found the Meaning of 'em, and &s;et him&s;elf, aukward|ly, to comfort her; and, by degrees, came to under&s;tand the be&s;t part of their la&s;t Night's melancholy Conver&s;ation. But when he learnt the Gentleman had re&s;olv'd to make no more Vi&s;its in that criminal manner, he was almo&s;t di&s;tracted at the Lo&s;s of &s;o good a Cu&s;tomer, as he term'd him; fell out with the poor in|nocent <HI>Eleanora,</HI> and was outrageous out of all Bounds. Sdeath! &s;aid he, this is your Doings! Pray, what the wor&s;e are you, for what is pa&s;t? Have not I gain'd more by the Squire in one Month, than I have got in three Years by my Practice? But however, I have one Card more to play yet; and &s;ince he has re&s;olv'd to make no more of his Vi&s;its, I'll make him pay well for the la&s;t. He then declar'd he wou'd have the Penalty of the Bond, which he had broke, by di&s;clo&s;ing to her their Terms of Agreement, and if he wou'd not pay him willingly, the Law &s;hou'd force him.</P>
<P>The poor Wife was quite overwhelm'd with this avaricious Declaration, and intreat|ed her ba&s;e Husband, as well as her Sorrows wou'd permit, that he wou'd de&s;i&s;t in &s;uch a
<PB N="254" REF="260">
mean Proceeding; but to no Purpo&s;e. Nay, he farther told her, &s;he mu&s;t be his chief Evi|dence in the Cau&s;e. And tho' &s;he declar'd &s;he wou'd put an End to her Shame by Death, yet he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted, and went to the Gentle|man the next Day, who, at his unrea&s;onable Demand, gave him no other An&s;wer, but a &s;ound Ba&s;tinado; and the Cuckold was ob|lig'd to go home with more Pains in his Bo|dy, than ever he felt in his Con&s;cience. His Head being broke, and his Face bruis'd, he was oblig'd to &s;tay at home &s;ome few Days, till his Hurts were heal'd. But the poor <HI>Eleanora</HI> felt the Effects of his Ill-humour; yet, notwith&s;tanding this hard Treatment, &s;he cou'd never once think of hating him, but bore all with the utmo&s;t Patience. She knew, by his Expre&s;&s;ions, that he had re&s;olv'd to go to Law upon a double Score, as well for the A&s;&s;ault, as Breach of Articles, whenever he was able to go abroad; therefore &s;he pre|vail'd upon her&s;elf to &s;end him the following Letter.</P>

<P>The Gentleman, who had now conceiv'd a di&s;intere&s;ted Friend&s;hip for her, was re&s;olv'd to comply with her ju&s;t Reque&s;t, without ex|pecting any Return, according to her Let|ter. Thereupon he &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the &s;ordid Wretch, that he was willing to come to an Accommodation, and in the End, got clear of him for 500 <HI>l.</HI> But the Matter cou'd not be fini&s;h'd without Witne&s;&s;es to general Relea&s;es; the&s;e having no other Concern than to make an End for their Friend the Squire, were not &s;o choice of keeping the Secret, and as mo&s;t Secrets are whi&s;per'd about to the En|largement of every thing, this Story lo&s;t no|thing by the Carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="262">At la&s;t Lady <HI>Fame</HI> trumpeted it about the whole Kingdom; 'till the cornuted Doctor cou'd not peep abroad for the Scoffs of the Neighbours; and his Patients, in general, abhorring the Fact, &s;ell from him; which &s;truck &s;o to his Heart, being wounded in the tendere&s;t Part, Intere&s;t, that in le&s;s than a Year, his wretched Soul took its la&s;t Fare|well of his vile Body.</P>
<P>The poor <HI>Eleanora</HI> (who re&s;ided with her Father when the Story began to be publick) cou'd not avoid grieving, out of her Sweet|ne&s;s of Temper, for a Wretch that did not de&s;erve her lea&s;t Regard; and beg'd her Fa|ther to &s;eek out &s;ome Retirement for her in the Country, where &s;he might end the re&s;t of her Days in peaceful Contemplation, free from the Cen&s;ure of the World. Her Father had ju&s;t procur'd her &s;uch a Place as &s;he de&s;ired, when the Gentleman that had been the Cau&s;e of her Sorrows, put an End to 'em.

<P><PB N="257" REF="263">When <HI>I&s;abella</HI> had fini&s;h'd this &s;hort true Story, her Manner of Reading was approv'd by every one of the Company, but my&s;elf; for I mu&s;t own, I had not recover'd Spirit enough even to open my Mouth; for I ob|&s;erv'd &s;he ca&s;t her Eyes, by turns, on all the Company, but &s;till avoided me.</P>
<P>They were &s;ometimes de&s;canting upon the Story, and every Per&s;on gave their Senti|ments; but I was in no Humour to give mine. Immediately after we parted, and as we rode home, <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid my Uncle, you &s;eem'd very melancholy all the while you were at my Lady's; you hardly took any Notice of tho&s;e about you, and your dumb Civility when we parted, &s;poke your Mind full of &s;ome melancholy Thoughts, which I judge were concerning the young <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> To deal ingenuou&s;ly, Uncle (I reply'd) the Car|riage of that amiable Creature almo&s;t di&s;tracts me, and I find Love &s;trengthens with every Morning's Sun; and tho' I wou'd give all the World for her E&s;teem, yet her Behaviour to me to-day, rai&s;es in me a decent Pride, which Pride will make me &s;hew my Re&s;entments in refraining my Vi&s;its.</P>
<P>Pr'ythee, <HI>Will,</HI> return'd my Uncle, don't appear more a Man in this Boyi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="258" REF="264">
than thou do&s;t in the re&s;t of thy Actions. I intend to part you and your Mi&s;tre&s;s, next Spring; therefore prepare your Mind accord|ingly, for you and your Tutor &s;hall make the Tour of <HI>Europe,</HI> for three Years; and by that time you may even forget the Name of <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> Nothing, Sir, &s;aid I, can make me forget her, or her U&s;age; tho' her Scorn will touch me nearer than any thing can fall upon me in this World, after lo&s;ing your Affection. Pr'ythee, have done with this Topic then, &s;aid my Uncle. The remaining Part of this Summer, I intend you and I &s;hall make a Journey over mo&s;t of the cele|brated Places in our own Country, that you may not be, as mo&s;t of our young Travel|lers are, inqui&s;itive after the Knowledge of foreign Climates, when you are a Stranger to your own. Sir, the &s;ooner you make this Journey (I reply'd) the better; and you cou'd not propo&s;e any thing I like &s;o well. Why then, &s;aid my Uncle, to-morrow we'll be going, after Dinner; I &s;uppo&s;e you have no|thing material to hinder you. Shou'd we not acquaint my Father and Mother with your Intention? &s;aid I. No, no matter, reply'd my Uncle, we'll take no Leave of any one, but the Company we have ju&s;t now left; nei|ther

wou'd I do that, but as their Hou&s;e will &s;tand in the way of our fir&s;t Day's Journey. The Thoughts of &s;eeing <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;o &s;oon, gave me &s;ome Satisfaction, tho' mixt with a great deal of Anxiety.</P>
<P>The next Morning we &s;et out; my Uncle altering his Re&s;olution of dining at home, in|tending to dine at my Lady's. When we came there, we were inform'd the whole Fa|mily were gone to dine with the Husband of <HI>Eleanora.</HI> This News, and Di&s;appointment of not &s;eeing <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> according to my Ex|pectation, almo&s;t overcame my Spirits; but I bore it outwardly well enough; and my Uncle &s;eem'd very well pleas'd with my Calm|ne&s;s of Temper; tho', alas! he little gue&s;s'd the Perturbation of my Thoughts. My Un|cle intended the fir&s;t Tour as far as <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and accordingly pur&s;u'd our Journey, with one Servant only. My Uncle was &s;uch plea|&s;ant Company, that I had not Lei&s;ure to think of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> till I went to Re&s;t; and even the Fatigues of the Day wou'd hardly prevent my waking all Night. Sometimes I imagin'd <HI>I&s;abella</HI> might have &s;ome tender Thoughts of me; e&s;pecially when I call'd to mind her former Conver&s;ation with me, and that my &s;udden Ab&s;ence might po&s;&s;ibly create
<PB N="260" REF="266">
her &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s. But then, her late Beha|viour to me, cancell'd tho&s;e plea&s;ing Hopes. It is needle&s;s to de&s;cribe the Towns we pa&s;s'd; but we arriv'd &s;afe at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> without any Accident, the once Regal Town of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edinburgh, Ag neda,</HI> or <HI>Edenburgum,</HI> was call'd, in the earlier Ages, <HI>Ca&s;trum Alatum.</HI> It &s;tands on a high Eminence; and the Plan of the City, as it lies, re&s;embles the Skeleton of a Human Figure. The Ca&s;tle was rec|kon'd, before the U&s;e of Cannon, impregna|ble; and is now of &s;ufficient Strength to with&s;tand a powerful Siege. The Buildings are very &s;trong, and large, compos'd of Free-Stone, and Mortar of a hard Cement, mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es eight Stories high. But as we have many De&s;criptions of <HI>Scotland,</HI> I &s;hall take no farther Notice of this City; only it is not very convenient to walk the Streets by Night, without a Per&s;on before you, who cries as he pa&s;&s;es along, <HI>Hand your Haund! Haud your Haund!</HI> otherwi&s;e you may chance to have upon your Heads &s;omething offen&s;ive to the No&s;e, as well as your Cloaths. The Streets, in the Morning, are cover'd over with &s;omewhat, that every one who walks till Ten of the Clock, may very well expect good Luck, according to our old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Saying.
<PB N="261" REF="267">
Before Noon, &s;o many People walk the Streets, there is not the lea&s;t remaining of that ill-cu&s;tom'd Filth.</P>
<P>In many Parts of the Streets &s;tands a Per|&s;on, with a great Cloak to cover his Cu&s;tom|ers, with another Conveniency, crying, <HI>Wha wants me?</HI></P>
<P>After vi&s;iting &s;everal Places in <HI>Scotland,</HI> we return'd, viewing the noted Places in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> in our Way home. Tho', I mu&s;t own, Curio&s;ity very often took up all my Thoughts, yet my Love was not in the lea&s;t le&s;&s;en'd; and the nearer I came to the Place of the Di|vine <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Abode, the more was the In|crea&s;e of my Anxiety. My Uncle had not once mention'd that Pa&s;&s;ion, thro' our whole Journey, till the Morning of the Day that put an End to our fir&s;t Tour. Now, &s;aid my Uncle, I imagine you have &s;ome Thoughts of your young Mi&s;tre&s;s. I intend to dine there to-day, but &s;hall leave the Conduct of that Part of your Life to your&s;elf, and &s;ay no more upon that Head. But when you &s;tand in need of my Advice, or A&s;&s;i&s;tance, ask it, and you &s;hall have it, becau&s;e I am a&s;&s;ur'd you will not ask any thing contrary to the Honour of a Gentleman. I return'd &s;uit|able thanks for &s;o kind a Conde&s;cen&s;ion, and
<PB N="262" REF="268">
chang'd the Subject, becau&s;e I thought my Uncle &s;eem'd pleas'd to have it &s;o.</P>
<P>We came to my Lady's about Twelve o' Clock, and were told they were Dre&s;&s;ing. My Uncle, notwith&s;tanding his Freedom, wou'd not interrupt 'em, but went to re&s;t up|on a Couch in the Parlour. I not being &s;o much fatigu'd, went into the Garden to in|dulge my Thoughts. But what was my Sur|pri&s;e, when I found the lovely <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;itting by the Fountain, with a Book in her Hand, on which &s;he &s;eem'd very intent; her Back was towards me, &s;o that I came within &s;ix Paces of her, before &s;he &s;aw me. At the Noi&s;e I made in approaching her, &s;he turn'd about, and upon &s;eeing me, gave a Shriek, and put the Book ha&s;tily in her Pocket. Ma|dam, &s;aid I, if I had thought that my Pre|&s;ence cou'd have created in your Mind any Di&s;turbance, I wou'd have &s;ooner cut off the&s;e Limbs that brought me hither, than have occa&s;ion'd it. La&s;t time I &s;aw you, has made me think my Sight di&s;ta&s;teful to you; but if you will inform me, that I de&s;erve to be thus puni&s;h'd, I have Courage enough to put an End to my Life, if it will be any Sa|tisfaction to you.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="269">No, Sir, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I &s;hou'd grieve to be the Death of any thing of the Brute Creation, much more any thing that bears a Human Form. And I am &s;o far from think|ing there is any Bravery in putting an End to Life, that, be&s;ide the unrepented Crime, I think it a Poverty of Spirit, and want of For|titude to bear the Ills of Life. Both <HI>Brutus,</HI> and <HI>Cato,</HI> were, in my Opinion, proud and pu&s;illanimous, and parted with Life, to rid 'em of their Fears. I cou'd, Madam, I re|turn'd, bear all the Ills of Life, but &s;lighted Love. Young Gentlemen, like you, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> talking of Love, is like Fools talk|ing Divinity; it will leave but little Impre&s;|&s;ion on the Judicious; and I have formerly told you, this Topic is not proper for you to talk of, or me to hear. Well, Madam, &s;aid I, if by covering the Flame of Love, I had any Hope Time wou'd kindle that inno|cent Fire in you, that Thought wou'd give me Ea&s;e; and whatever Climate this Body &s;hou'd be in, my Soul wou'd be with you. I doubt not, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> but your Body and Soul were together in your &s;hort Travels, and this new Pa&s;&s;ion, Love, was laid by for Curio&s;ity. I will not deny, I return'd, but Knowledge is what my Mind is bent upon;
<PB N="264" REF="270">
but even the acquiring that, does but the more indear the Thoughts of you; and all of your Sex that I &s;ee, does but oblige me to make Compari&s;ons, tho' there is none when I think of you.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, reply'd the Fair One, we'll leave this Di&s;cour&s;e, that I may not provoke any more Compliments, and de&s;ire to know the Progre&s;s of your &s;udden Journey. Sud|den indeed, I reply'd, for my Uncle did not take a Night to con&s;ider on't; but if you had felt one Particle of the Sorrow, if we may &s;o divide it, that I felt, when we were di&s;appointed of &s;eeing you, in our fir&s;t &s;etting out, you wou'd have &s;ome Motion of Pity. Mu&s;t every thing, cry'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> &s;miling, admini&s;ter to this youthful Folly? In me, I reply'd, 'tis a Whirlpool, that &s;wallows every thing that comes near it. Well, no more Similies, nor no more Love, return'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> but the Account of your Journey. Well, Madam, &s;aid I, you mu&s;t be obey'd. I then gave her a De&s;cription of every thing curious we had ob&s;erv'd in our &s;hort Tra|vels, with which &s;he &s;eem'd very much pleas'd. I am convinc'd, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> that all young Gentlemen that travel, do not make the &s;ame Improvement; or rather, many do not im|prove
<PB N="265" REF="271">
at all, but bring home greater Fools than they carry'd with 'em; I mean, tho&s;e that go into foreign Countries, for I take yours to be no more than a Journey, as we call it. But I believe, by this time, my Mother and Aunt are dre&s;s'd, therefore it will be very proper for me to wait on 'em. Dear, Madam, &s;aid I, relieve my Torments, and &s;ay you do not de&s;pi&s;e me. I &s;hall &s;ay no more at this time, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> than that I mu&s;t wait on my Mother; therefore come along, and hold your Tongue. Upon this I led her by the Hand, and had not an Opportunity of &s;peaking to her in Return, becau&s;e there were &s;everal Workmen in the Garden wou'd have heard our Di&s;cour&s;e. As we were hurrying a|long, the Wind blew her Petticoat upon my Spur, which, &s;tooping to untangle ha&s;tily, I prick'd my Fingers with the Rowel, and they bled very much; &s;earching my Pocket for a Handkerchief to wrap my Hand in, I re|member'd that I had left it in my Hat in the Parlour, when we fir&s;t came in. <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> up|on that, took hers out, and gave it me, and at the &s;ame time let fall a folded Paper, &s;he drew out with the Handkerchief, un&s;een by her. I took it up without Ob&s;ervation, by letting the Handkerchief fall upon't, and
<PB N="266" REF="272">
&s;ecretly convey'd it into my Pocket. When I came in to my Uncle, he was fa&s;t a&s;leep; upon which, I &s;tole out again, not &s;eeing the Ladies in the Parlour. As, &s;oon as I came to a convenient Place in the Garden, I took out the Paper I had found, and when I had o|pen'd it, perceiv'd it was the Letter, and Song I had formerly &s;ent her; and by being much worn in the Folds, I imagin'd with a plea&s;ing Satisfaction &s;he had often perus'd it for my Sake. At the Bottom of the Letter, I found the&s;e Lines of the Poet:
<Q><L>In vain, all Arts the Love-&s;ick Virgin tries,</L>
<L>Affects to frown, and &s;eems &s;everely wi&s;e,</L>
<L>In hopes to cheat the wary Lover's Eyes.</L>
<L>If the dear Youth her Pity &s;eems to move,</L>
<L>And pleads with Tenderne&s;s the Cau&s;e of Love,</L>
<L>Nature a&s;&s;erts her Empire in her Heart,</L>
<L>And kindly takes the faithful Lover's Part:</L>
<L>By Love, her Self, and Nature, thus betray'd,</L>
<L>No more &s;he tru&s;ts in Pride's Fanta&s;tick Aid,</L>
<L>But bids her Eyes confe&s;s the yielding Maid.</L></Q></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Lines I remember'd very well in the celebrated Play of <HI>Tamerlane:</HI> But the follow|ing Ver&s;es, as I cou'd not charge my Memory with, I fancy'd were of her own Com|po&s;ition,
<PB N="267" REF="273">
and &s;eem'd as an An&s;wer to the others:
<Q><L>Too &s;oon, alas! I've felt the tingling Dart,</L>
<L>And Love-triumphant rides within my Heart:</L>
<L>But, &s;pite of pleading Love, and Nature's Cau&s;e,</L>
<L>That thro' the World di&s;pen&s;es rigid Laws:</L>
<L>The Flame &s;hall be conceal'd within my Brea&s;t,</L>
<L>Tho' the &s;harp Pangs di&s;turb my balmy Re&s;t.</L>
<L>I'll learn my Eyes (tho&s;e Tell-Tales of the Mind)</L>
<L>To look &s;evere, tho' my poor Heart is kind:</L>
<L>My Tongue no Whi&s;per of my Griefs &s;hall tell,</L>
<L>Ev'n Love &s;hall teach me to di&s;&s;emble well.</L></Q></P>
<P>I had the Vanity to imagine, the la&s;t Lines very much concern'd me; which cer|tainly wou'd have made me lo&s;e my Sen&s;es with Joy, if a Doubt had not aro&s;e, that &s;ome other might be meant. The Thought of that kept the Balance even with Hope, and &s;ometimes &s;eem'd to weigh heavier.</P>
<P>I was upon the Rack of Thought, when a Servant came to acquaint me the Ladies were dre&s;s'd, and in the Parlour. After the ordi|nary Salutations, the Mother and Aunt be|gan to rally my Uncle, for going his Jour|ney without taking Leave of 'em. Why re|ally, reply'd my Uncle, I think it the be&s;t
<PB N="268" REF="274">
way to avoid Impertinence, for I hate your formal Parting. However, you are &s;uch eternal Gadders, there's no finding you at home; for we did you the Honour to call upon you as we &s;et out; and, that we may &s;pare our&s;elves &s;ome Trouble, we &s;hall now take our Leaves for one Month more; for we &s;hall &s;et out upon another Tour to mor|row. Why this is doing Bu&s;ine&s;s indeed, re|ply'd the Aunt! You'll fatigue the young Gentleman too much. Fatigue! return'd my Uncle; &s;ure if I am able to bear it, he very well may. But my chief Rea&s;on of this &s;udden Journeying is, to &s;hew my Nephew &s;ome of his own Country, before he begins his Foreign Travels, that he may &s;atisfy the Curio&s;ity of any Per&s;on that wants to be in|form'd, when he's abroad. Pray, when do you intend he &s;hou'd begin his Foreign Tra|vels, as you call 'em, &s;aid the Mother. Ev'n as &s;oon as he has fini&s;h'd his Home ones, re|turn'd my Uncle. At this, I ob&s;erv'd <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>'s Colour to change, and ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, to hide her Concern, threw up the Sa&s;h, and look'd out of the Window, unob&s;erv'd by any one but my&s;elf. The Joy I felt was al|mo&s;t without Bounds, and I &s;tood in need of the utmo&s;t Art to conceal it. There were
<PB N="269" REF="275">
&s;everal Di&s;cour&s;es, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> upon young Gentlemen's Travelling; but my Mind was &s;o full of the happy Exta&s;y I had conceiv'd, that I took but little Notice of either. Well, &s;aid my Uncle, what you Women &s;ay upon the&s;e Subjects, is but whipt Cream, all Froth, and nothing &s;ub&s;tantial. But how mu&s;t we employ our&s;elves till Dinner, for I can't walk? What think you of <HI>Ombre,</HI> or <HI>Quadrille,</HI> &s;aid the Aunt? With all my Heart, a Game at <HI>Ombre,</HI> reply'd my Uncle. But that won't employ us all, &s;aid the Mother. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> com|plain'd of a Pain in her Head, and therefore was unfit to make one; and for my Part, I declar'd I did not under&s;tand the Game. So the Mother, the Aunt, and my Uncle, &s;at to it. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> went up into her Chamber, and carry'd with her the Object of my Adora|tion. When &s;he was gone, I went into the Garden to feed upon Contemplation; and, in my own Imagination, thought my&s;elf the happie&s;t Creature in the Univer&s;e. But my Satisfaction did not la&s;t long, for, walking upon a Terras that overlook'd the Country, I &s;aw a Coach and Six &s;top at the Gate. There came out of it an elderly Gentleman, follow'd by a young one about Twenty, as I gue&s;s'd; and before I cou'd make any
<PB N="270" REF="276">
Judgment of 'em, two Fellows that were at work under the Terras-Wall, who did not &s;ee me. were ob&s;erving the Coach. Ad&s;o! &s;aid one to the other, There's young Lady's Suitor, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> and his Father, com'd again. I had not Power to &s;tir, at this un|expected Knowledge, and remain'd a con&s;i|derable time like one thunder&s;truck. A thou|&s;and Re&s;olutions crouded into my Mind, and all to the de&s;troying of my Peace. My Ri|val was hated with an immortal Hatred, be|fore I knew him, and his or my Death was fix'd as irrevocable as Fate. The Perturba|tion of my Fancy work'd &s;o violently, that my Strength fail'd me, and I fell, almo&s;t Sen&s;ele&s;s, upon a Gra&s;s-Plat, where my fee|ble Limbs had unknowingly carry'd me. When the Hurry of my confus'd Thoughts was over, they gave me ab&s;olute De&s;pair. I was a&s;&s;ur'd an Hour before, &s;he lov'd, and Hope had flatter'd me, that I was the happy He; but now I as &s;urely thought, my Rival was the Object of her Wi&s;hes. Why then, thought I, why &s;hou'd I endeavour to de|&s;troy one, whom &s;he wou'd wi&s;h &s;hou'd live? that will not be the way to gain her, but ra|ther make her loath me. Death &s;eem'd to me the only Friend; yet, thro' a Principle
<PB N="271" REF="277">
of my Faith, I cou'd not put an End to Life. I only wi&s;h'd for Death, without the Thought of &s;eparating Soul and Body.</P>
<P>Long I lay in my Confu&s;ion of Thought; till at la&s;t I beheld the divine <HI>I&s;abella</HI> in the Garden, looking about, as for &s;omething &s;he had lo&s;t, which I imagin'd to be the Paper I took up. She was within two Paces of me before &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he was &s;o intent on what &s;he was about; and when her Eyes encoun|ter'd mine, &s;he &s;tarted back, as tho' &s;he had beheld &s;omething baneful to her. Well, Madam, &s;aid I, mu&s;t I ever be the Object of Horror to your Eyes? and mu&s;t you always &s;tart at the Sight of me, as if you &s;aw the Form of one ri&s;e from the Grave? A little Time will take this Bugbear from your Sight, I hope, for ever. I know, I can never de&s;erve your Love; and yet I cannot bear to &s;ee you make another happy. For Heaven's &s;ake! cry'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> &s;urpris'd, what is it moves you &s;o? Why do you lie &s;tretch'd on the Ground, and look as if &s;ome Di&s;traction had &s;eiz'd you? Come, give me your Hand, and let us walk; have a Que&s;tion to ask you, which I expect to be truly re&s;olv'd in. Have you found any Paper of Writing, &s;ince you came into the Garden? There, Madam,
<PB N="272" REF="278">
&s;aid I; and wou'd to Heaven I had never &s;een it! (giving her the Paper) there, take it. I mu&s;t own, I cannot blame you. Love is not to be forc'd; 'tis a free-born Child of the Mind. I only think the young Gentleman is compleatly ble&s;s'd. I am &s;ure, I &s;hou'd be di&s;tracted with the mighty Joy, in &s;uch Re|turn of Love.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> this Freedom I can forgive, becau&s;e I &s;ee &s;omething extraor|dinary has ruffled your Temper. I doubt not but you have read the&s;e Lines (pointing to the Letter) that were writ on the Blank Leaf; 'tis the Thought of a young Gentle|woman, a Neighbour of mine; I liking the Lines, tran&s;crib d 'em. I was under &s;ome Concern, I own, for the Lo&s;s of the Paper, becau&s;e the Ballad that you &s;ent me was along with it, and I promis'd her to copy it, and &s;end it back this Evening.</P>
<P>I &s;oon perceiv'd, by &s;ome Confu&s;ion in the Utterance of the&s;e Words, that what &s;he &s;aid was to di&s;gui&s;e the Truth, and that Thought &s;tabb'd me to the Heart; tho' her Civility to me, &s;eem'd tender enough, yet I imagin'd that was only to blind me, and prevent any farther Enquiry. While we both were in great Confu&s;ion of Thought, we perceiv'd
<PB N="273" REF="279">
Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> coming down out of the Hall, in|to the Garden. To let you &s;ee, your Su&s;pi|cions are unju&s;t, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> (for I had in|form'd her what I heard one of the Work|men &s;ay) I'll in&s;tantly avoid the Per&s;on we &s;ee coming. With that &s;he went into a pri|vate Walk, and opening a Door that led into another Garden, took me by the Hand, and pull'd me in after her, then &s;hut to the Door again. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this Proceeding be|gan to revive Hope, that, 'till then, &s;eem'd quite expir'd. This Conde&s;cen&s;ion, &s;aid I, does, indeed, &s;omething ea&s;e my Heart, but yet will not cure my Pain. That young Gentleman, no doubt, comes here to make his Addre&s;&s;es to you, and coming thus pub|lickly attended by that elderly Gentleman, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be his Father, tells me he has the Approbation of your Mother and Aunt.</P>
<P>I will not deny, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> but that Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> pretends to be my Lover, and my Mother and Aunt do not di&s;countenance him. But they have more Tenderne&s;s for me, than to force my Inclination. And you more Duty, I reply'd, than to contradict 'em. No Sir, return'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I am &s;atisfy'd they never will impo&s;e any one upon me for a Hus|band;
<PB N="274" REF="280">
or &s;hou'd they endeavour it, tho' Duty is very prevalent with me, yet in that one on|ly Thing, I wou'd dare to di&s;obey.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, my De&s;tiny, I find, has mark'd me for unhappy, for Title and Riches mu&s;t prevail. I have told you before, re|ply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> that Fortune I de&s;pi&s;e, and Title can no more make a Man Good and Virtuous, in my Opinion, than a good and virtuous Man can make a Title. A King can give Honour, but not Hone&s;ty; yet, like the Sun, it &s;hines upon Weeds that are often admir'd for their eminent Worthle&s;ne&s;s. Your Sentiments of Honour, divine <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I re|ply'd, are &s;o ju&s;t, that in&s;pires me to ask you one Que&s;tion, and hope an An&s;wer. What is it, return'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> in &s;ome Confu|&s;ion? Am I to hope, &s;aid I, or de&s;pair? I wou'd not have made the important Que|&s;tion &s;o abruptly; but the Time of my De|parture is &s;o &s;hort, and my Unhappine&s;s of not &s;eeing you &s;o often as my impatient Heart de&s;ires, will, I am a&s;&s;ur'd from your Good|ne&s;s, &s;tand excus'd, whatever your Heart can &s;ay, for, or again&s;t me. Why will you Pre&s;s me, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> now? I have (I re|turn'd) told you my Rea&s;ons already. Think, ere you an&s;wer me, for my whole Peace of
<PB N="275" REF="281">
Mind depends upon't; and if I am bani&s;h'd from your Pre&s;ence now, with cold De&s;pair, I am a&s;&s;ur'd I cannot &s;urvive it. No Love was ever more pure than mine, or &s;tronger. A di&s;tant Hope of once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing you, wou'd arm me for all Dangers; and I cou'd wait patiently an Age of Torments, if in the End I &s;hou'd be ble&s;t with your con&s;enting Love. Do not &s;urmi&s;e my Pa&s;&s;ion, youthful Folly; 'tis rooted in my Soul &s;o deep, that no Storm of Fortune can ever &s;hake its Foundation. If you cannot love, freely declare it, as you wou'd your Vows to Heaven; I &s;hall only blame my Stars, not you; and take for ever from your Sight, an Object hateful to him|&s;elf as well as you.</P>
<P>Hate, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> is not in my Na|ture; and &s;ince you pre&s;s me to declare my|&s;elf, the Per&s;on you &s;aw me fly from, never &s;hall have my Heart; and be a&s;&s;ur'd, if you remain ever con&s;tant, I &s;hall, no doubt, in time, be willing to reward that Con&s;tancy. This Declaration, continu'd <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> blu&s;h|ing, is much more than I &s;o &s;oon intended to let you know; and what Con&s;tructions you put upon it, keep it a Secret from the whole World: Let not your Uncle, whom I know you can hide nothing from, be acquainted
<PB N="276" REF="282">
with the lea&s;t Syllable. This, from a Per|&s;on of <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Character, was enough to rai&s;e me from the Dead. I &s;aid all an im|patient loving Heart cou'd &s;ugge&s;t; and was &s;o extravagant in my tran&s;porting Joy, that <HI>I&s;abella</HI> check'd me, telling me, I &s;hou'd cer|tainly di&s;cover &s;omething extraordinary had happen'd to me, if I had not a Heed to my Eyes and Tongue. Before we parted, &s;he open'd all her Soul to me, telling me, her Pa&s;&s;ion did not &s;eem &s;o violent as mine, but more la&s;ting.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, never was a Man more happy than I thought my&s;elf. However, Prudence oblig'd us to part, tho' I cou'd have liv'd for ever in her Company. She gave me the Key, to let me thro' the &s;ame Way we came in, while &s;he went another Way; fir&s;t com|manding me not to &s;hew the lea&s;t Re&s;ent|ment to the young Nobleman, if we &s;hou'd meet. I reply'd, I knew &s;o well the Nature of his Di&s;ea&s;e, that, if he truly lov'd her, he had now a Title to my Pity. We left each other, with a Promi&s;e to meet in the Afternoon again, in the &s;ame Place, if an Opportunity offer'd.</P>
<P>When I had parted with the divine <HI>I&s;a|bella,</HI> I went up the Walk with the utmo&s;t
<PB N="277" REF="283">
Contentment in my Heart; tho' I endea|vour'd to conceal it in my Countenance as much as po&s;&s;ible. Upon the Terras I met Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> whom I &s;aluted, and pa&s;s'd him; he return'd it indeed, but with too much Pride, as I thought. However, I pa&s;s'd on, and took no farther Notice of him. When I came into the Parlour, I found the old Gentleman, with the two Ladies and my Un|cle, playing at <HI>Quadrille,</HI> and <HI>I&s;abella</HI> read|ing in the Window. Immediately after, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> came in, and finding <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> expre&s;t abundance of of ful&s;ome Joy at the Sight of her. I mu&s;t own, I was oblig'd to make u&s;e of all my Philo&s;ophy, to keep my Temper, and &s;hou'd very hardly have done it, if <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI> had not rally'd him with &s;o much Wit, as in the end, gave me a malicious Satis|faction. I ob&s;erv'd, all the Company &s;eem'd as well pleas'd, only the Gentleman that came with him; but he being &s;omething deaf, cou'd not under&s;tand every thing that was &s;aid.</P>
<P>When Dinner was &s;erv'd in, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> plac'd him&s;elf next <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and was conti|nually helping her to &s;uch Quantities, that wou'd have &s;erv'd her a Week. I ob&s;erve, Sir, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> you wou'd have me eat for
<PB N="278" REF="284">
the whole Family; or, if you imagin'd every body in Company had as good a Stomach as you &s;uppo&s;e me to have, by your loading my Plate, they might ri&s;e ready for another Din|ner. However, I am oblig'd to you. You mi&s;take the Gentleman, reply'd my Uncle, he's a young <HI>Cannibal,</HI> he only fats you as we do Chickens, in hope of feeding upon you. Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> took what my Uncle &s;aid, as a very good Je&s;t, and laugh'd heartily; &s;aying, if he &s;hou'd feed upon her, &s;he wou'd go very much again&s;t his Stomach. At the End of his ridiculous Je&s;t, he laugh'd &s;o im|moderately, with his Mouth full, that he &s;putter'd it in my Face. I wou'd the Gentle|man, &s;aid I, had taken an Opportunity of laughing when his Mouth was empty, I &s;hou'd have been the more oblig'd to him. Harkye, young Gentleman, reply'd Sir <HI>Eu|&s;tace,</HI> you were told before I was a <HI>Cannibal,</HI> and I can a&s;&s;ure you, I often eat Young&s;ters that are too forward. Really, Sir, &s;aid I, very calmly, I can't &s;ee that prodigious Sto|mach in your Countenance, or any thing there, wou'd make me afraid to meet you any where fa&s;ting.</P>
<P>The Company laugh'd to &s;ee his Unea&s;i|ne&s;s at my Reply, but he gave me no An|&s;wer.
<PB N="279" REF="285">
<HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I ob&s;erv'd, &s;eem'd much con|cern'd at what I &s;aid, and, with a Look with her Eyes, told me, I &s;hou'd carry the Je&s;t no farther. Well, Sir, &s;aid I, without je&s;ting, I mean no Harm; if you make any farther Con&s;tructions on my Words, but as a Je&s;t, you go beyond my Meaning. This molli|fying Speech &s;eem'd to rai&s;e his Anger more. A Je&s;t has often co&s;t the Maker his Life, re|ply'd Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> and &s;uch young Gentlemen as you, &s;hou'd remember the Smart of the Rod, and curb their Tongues for fear of a Whipping. Sir, &s;aid I, I pre&s;ume your vo|racious <HI>Cannibal</HI>'s Stomach is not quite ap|peas'd, therefore I'll take a Walk in the Gar|den, for fear you &s;hou'd fall foul on me in an improper Place; &s;aying this, I aro&s;e, and taking my Hat and Sword out of the Win|dow, went into the Garden.</P>
<P>The whole Company aro&s;e to &s;top the Ba|ron, who offer'd to follow me. My Uncle began to be very much di&s;turb'd, upon my Account; and, as he told me afterwards, did intend to follow me. But, thinking to oblige me, he de&s;ired the Mother to &s;end <HI>I&s;abella</HI> af|ter me. When &s;he came up to me, &s;he began to reproach me with my Conduct, telling me, if I had any Hope or De&s;ire to gain her Heart,
<PB N="280" REF="286">
I mu&s;t conceal my Pa&s;&s;ion from all the World, and this Proceeding will betray the Secret; if not on your Side, &s;aid &s;he, tenderly, I fear my Concern will. Tho&s;e Words have Force enough to re&s;tore me to my Sen&s;es, were I in the Grave, &s;aid I; and after this Confe&s;|&s;ion, that makes me the happie&s;t of Mortals, even Blows &s;hall not make me draw my Sword, if you de&s;ire it. No, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I know what Men of Honour &s;hou'd bear; and I &s;hou'd de&s;pi&s;e the Wretch for being a Coward. Yet, Madam, I reply'd, Cowar|dice can no more be help'd, than the Tinc|ture of a Skin; 'tis rooted in the Nature, and known Cowards, like Fools, &s;hou'd be pity'd. Certainly, no Man wou'd be a Cow|ard if he cou'd help it, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; but when I &s;ay I &s;hou'd de&s;pi&s;e a Coward, I ima|gine to my&s;elf, the Man that has true Cou|rage, has every other noble Qualification, that will make him de&s;erving; as on the con|trary, a Coward Soul inherits every weak Failing, and is as incapable of doing a wor|thy Action, as the Man of Spirit is of doing a mean one. I &s;hall ever &s;ubmit my Actions, to you, Madam, &s;aid I. Then, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> immediately return, and be reconcil'd to the hot Spark within, whom the more I know,
<PB N="281" REF="287">
the more I de&s;pi&s;e; and I fan&s;y that Decla|ration won't di&s;plea&s;e you; but I'll have no Reply now. Nothing more but this, &s;aid I, you promis'd me a Meeting in the Afternoon, which I fear will be a difficult thing to bring to pa&s;s. Do you &s;tart Difficulties, reply'd <HI>I&s;a|bella?</HI> Never fear, I warrant we'll bring it about. The &s;ame River that runs thro' your Garden, runs thro' the Bottom of ours, there|fore I'll propo&s;e Fi&s;hing. We'll go fir&s;t, and the Man &s;hall take us two over to an I&s;land in the River, and return. My Mother does not care to go into a Boat, and the re&s;t of the Company, I &s;uppo&s;e, out of Complain|&s;ance, will &s;tay with her. But I fear, Ma|dam, the young Spark will come to inter|rupt us, &s;aid I. Why that's all we have to fear, reply'd <HI>I&s;abella</HI>; but as &s;oon as he comes, we'll return; and that, I hope, will give you &s;ome Satisfaction. Do but con&s;ider my Tem|per, and you'll find this is enough to make you ea&s;y. This I can do, without Su&s;picion from any one; for none of my Family &s;u&s;|pects either you or me to be in Love. There have &s;o many Accidents odly concurr'd to|day, that I will no longer conceal it from you. Fir&s;t, your &s;udden Departure, then this Rival, and the di&s;agreeable Quarrel.
<PB N="282" REF="288">
Tho' your Rival is the main Motive, join'd with your Foreign Tour, which I under&s;tand by your Uncle, is for three Years. But I'll &s;ay no more now, in the Afternoon we &s;hall have a better Opportunity. As &s;oon as I came into the Dining-Room, Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> met me, with a con&s;train'd Smile, and told me, he was &s;orry any Unea&s;ine&s;s had been crea|ted by Words utter'd without Thought, and &s;hou'd, for the future, be willing to have more Acquaintance with me. I &s;hou'd have con|&s;ider'd indeed, there is &s;ome Difference in our Years, &s;aid he; therefore I own my&s;elf the Criminal, and ask Pardon for what's pa&s;t. Years, &s;aid my Uncle, do not always imply Age or Under&s;tanding; for &s;ome at Fifteen have the Di&s;cretion of Thirty; and Fifty-Five, in a good Con&s;titution, is an abler Man than Five and Thirty; I mean, continu'd my Un|cle, &s;miling, &s;ome Men are younger at Sixty, than others at Thirty. That is a Compli|ment, reply'd the Aunt, we may very rea|&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, de&s;ign'd for your&s;elf. How|ever, let's have no more of 'em; we'll make an End of our Dinner, and drink a Cup of Oblivion, and then all will be well again. Meaning Tea, I &s;uppo&s;e, reply'd my Uncle, where every Cup is broaching new Scandal,
<PB N="283" REF="289">
and we &s;hall have &s;o much Noi&s;e, and &s;o lit|tle under&s;tood, that it will put me in mind of the Confu&s;ion of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>I found the Company were not rightly in Humour, yet I perceiv'd, with &s;ome Satis|faction, that I was not the Occa&s;ion; even the old Gentleman that came with Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace,</HI> appear'd concern'd for his Behaviour. After we were ri&s;en from Table, the Company di|vided into Parties, all but my Uncle, who went to take his u&s;ual Afternoon's Nap. The deaf old Gentleman &s;ingled me out, and led me into the Garden. Said he, I have the Misfortune of having but an ill Hearing, yet I heard enough to know my Son was much in Fault. Youth, Fortune, and Title, make him too pre&s;uming. I have, with the be&s;t Advice I am capable of giving him, endea|vour'd to &s;often his too turbulent Temper; but, I fear, 'tis rooted too deeply in his Na|ture, ever to be eras'd. Honour &s;hou'd be tack'd to Nobility; yet, I find Mankind &s;o deprav'd in their Nature, that the more Power they have, the greater Propen&s;ity they have to do Evil, which &s;hews, to the Judicious, Riches and Titles ill plac'd. But as Nobili|ty can be no more inherited than Virtue, &s;o, in my Opinion, he is noble that has noble In|clinations.
<PB N="284" REF="290">
I &s;hou'd not talk to one &s;o little advanc'd in Years, in this manner, as I do to you, if I had not been inform'd by my Lady, of a ripe Under&s;tanding in &s;o early an Age. I expect no Reply in the Complimen|tal Way; I only beg you wou'd forgive my Son, and, for the future, know me for your Friend. I &s;hou'd de&s;ire your Conver&s;ation, but my Infirmity will not admit of it, there|fore I &s;hall take my Leave of you. Upon this he went from me, and left me full of Re|gard for his right Way of Thinking.</P>
<P>While I was mu&s;ing upon what he &s;aid to me, <HI>I&s;abella</HI> came down the Walks, follow'd by a Servant with Fi&s;hing-Tackle. Come, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he pa&s;t me, you are to teach me how to catch Fi&s;h, for as yet, I am but a mere Bungler. With all my Heart, Ma|dam, I reply'd. When the Servant had put us over to the I&s;land, <HI>I&s;abella</HI> &s;aid to him, <HI>John,</HI> I de&s;ire you wou'd bring over no Stran|gers. No, no, Madam, <HI>John</HI> reply'd; if you'll be pleas'd to tell me when I &s;hall wait on you, to bring you back, I'll lock the Boat on the other &s;ide, and be out of the way till then. Do, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and fetch us a|bout an Hour hence. When <HI>John</HI> was gone, I fell at the Fair One's Feet, and gave her
<PB N="285" REF="291">
Thanks for this &s;urpri&s;ing Conde&s;cen&s;ion. What Words, divine <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> &s;aid I, &s;hall I u&s;e to expre&s;s my Gratitude! but there are none that will &s;peak the lea&s;t Part of what my Mind feels; you have rais'd me from the Bottom of De&s;pair, to the Summit of Joy; and when my Heart forgets this Good|ne&s;s, may I be for ever mi&s;erable! Your Prote&s;tations I believe, return'd the divine <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> rai&s;ing me from the Earth, and I will freely declare, if you ever &s;hou'd prove fal&s;e, the Knowledge will break my Heart. I was going once more to fall at her Feet, but was interrupted in my exalted Bli&s;s, by a Noi&s;e we heard at the Boat.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> mi&s;&s;ing us in the Garden, and being inform'd by the Aunt where we were gone, follow'd us. But <HI>John</HI> had made the Boat too fa&s;t for him to undo, without his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. But in the Bu&s;tle he made to un|loo&s;e it, he tumbled into the Water, and by that time I came to the Water-&s;ide, he was &s;unk to the Bottom. All other Pa&s;&s;ions flew immediately from my Brea&s;t, but Pity, and when I &s;aw the Danger he was in, I threw my&s;elf into the Water, and, by good For|tune, caught hold of a Shoulder-Knot he wore, and brought him to the I&s;land, with|out
<PB N="286" REF="292">
any Appearance of Life. When I had dragg'd him on Shore, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> I held him up by the Heels again&s;t a Tree, where he di&s;gorg'd the Water he had &s;wallow'd, and fetching two or three Groans, he came to him&s;elf; tho' &s;o faint, he cou'd not &s;tand; and for want of proper Reme|dies, we were in Fear he might not &s;urvive the Accident, for we were too far from the Hou&s;e to make 'em hear us. I therefore pull'd off my Coat and Wai&s;tcoat, and &s;wam acro&s;s the River to the Garden, and inform'd the Family of the Accident; but <HI>John</HI> was no where to be found. The Difficulty we had to get the Boat loo&s;e, took up &s;o much time, that Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> was almo&s;t peri&s;h'd with Cold, ere we cou'd bring him A&s;&s;i&s;tance; and <HI>I&s;a|bella</HI>'s Fear had almo&s;t put her in the &s;ame Condition. It was with much Difficulty, by pouring Cordials into his Mouth, that we brought him once more to his Sen&s;es. He was put to bed; but the Fright, and the Water he drank, threw him into a high Fe|ver. The Hurry of my Spirits, and being &s;o long in my wet Cloaths, gave me a great deal of Di&s;order; and, having no other Cloaths to &s;hift me (for my Uncle's Servants were gone home with our Equipage) I was
<PB N="287" REF="293">
oblig'd to go to Bed too, but had the Satis|faction of being laid in <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Bed; and, what heighten'd that Satisfaction, I was &s;trip'd of my wet Shirt, and, by the Mother's Or|der, had one of <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Shifts put on me. The Joy took away all Thoughts of my Di&s;|order; but it cou'd not hinder a &s;trong Fever &s;eizing me, to the utmo&s;t Concern of all the Family. The Father of the Nobleman ex|pre&s;s'd more Concern for me, than his Son, giving me all the Encomiums due to the mo&s;t con&s;ummate Virtue; that maugre the Di&s;ta&s;te I might have ju&s;tly conceiv'd again&s;t his Son, I had hazarded my own Life to pre&s;erve his. I mu&s;t own, the Action gave me a great deal of Satisfaction, and the Prai&s;es, tho' no Ad|dition to Pride (for that's a Failing I hope I &s;hall ever be a Stranger to) yet pleas'd me, becau&s;e I had done what many of my Age wou'd have neglected, or refus'd.</P>
<P>The following Day, my Fever abated, but Sir <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> &s;eem'd wor&s;e and wor&s;e. I was griev'd I cou'd not have an Opportu|nity of &s;eeing the Divine <HI>I&s;abella</HI> alone, du|ring my &s;hort Illne&s;s. But I had the Happi|ne&s;s of receiving a Letter from her, which &s;he put into my Hand unob&s;erv'd by any one. But the Joy I felt in reading the following
<PB N="288" REF="294">
Lines, had more Force than any of the Doc|tor's Pre&s;criptions towards my Cure.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>WHAT &s;hall I &s;ay, to de&s;cribe the Anxie|ty of my Mind for your Illne&s;s? My Heart, unguarded now from all the Niceties of my Sex, freely declares it&s;elf yours. But yet, let us both be careful. I wou'd not have our Pa&s;&s;ions whi&s;per'd in a De&s;art; tho' perhaps, thro' the Knowledge of your Virtues, it might not meet with many Ob&s;tacles. My Mother and Aunt, I am a&s;&s;ur'd, contemn the Addre&s;&s;es of your Rival, even as much as I do. However, once more, I beg you to be cautious; conceal our Loves even from your good Uncle; and be a&s;|&s;ur'd, the two Per&s;ons under our Roof, are the entire Joy and Contempt of ever yours,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I wi&s;h'd my Indi&s;po&s;ition had continu'd longer, that I might have had the Satisfac|tion of being under the &s;ame Roof with my dear <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> But my Health return'd, and I was oblig'd to go home to my Uncle's, with|out conver&s;ing in private with her. How|ever
<PB N="289" REF="295">
the Contentment of my Mind appear'd in my Face, and my Uncle &s;everal times took Notice of it, yet I conceal'd, accord|ing to her De&s;ire, even from him, the Rea|&s;on of it.</P>
<P>When we had been at home a Week, my Uncle told me we &s;hou'd make another Tour the next Day; and I gather'd by his Di&s;|cour&s;e, that we &s;hou'd not make any more Vi|&s;its to <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Mother, till we came back, which wou'd not be in &s;ix Weeks. The Heart-breaking I felt, almo&s;t kill'd me. I did not doubt, but I cou'd have gain'd Leave to make a Vi&s;it alone; but I knew I mu&s;t then have di&s;cover'd more than <HI>I&s;abella</HI> wou'd like. I ca&s;t about, &s;everal Hours, how to &s;end her a Letter without Su&s;picion; but, to my Mortification, cou'd not pitch upon an Expedient. But while I was perplexing my Brain to no Purpo&s;e, I had the unexpected Joy of &s;eeing her Coach &s;top at the Door; and before I cou'd recover my&s;elf from the plea&s;ing Confu&s;ion, &s;he enter'd, with her Mo|ther and Aunt. But under&s;tanding my Un|cle was in the Garden, the Mother and Aunt went to him, and left the divine <HI>I&s;abella</HI> alone with me in the Parlour. The &s;udden Sur|prize had ty'd my Tongue fa&s;t, and it was
<PB N="290" REF="296">
&s;ome time ere I cou'd &s;peak a Word. All I cou'd do, was to fall at her Feet with the utmo&s;t Tran&s;port of Joy, which was in|creas'd by her rai&s;ing me, and putting her Lily Hand round my Neck, pre&s;&s;ing my Head clo&s;e to her Bo&s;om. I &s;poke at la&s;t, but &s;uch wild incoherent Speeches, that gave her more Satisfaction, &s;he told me, than if I had utter'd Volumes of regular Non&s;en&s;e, vulgarly call'd, Love. But when I told her of our intended Journey the next Day, her amiable Countenance was overclouded with Sorrow, and ere we cou'd recover our&s;elves, my Uncle, her Mother and Aunt came out of the Garden; but before they enter'd the Room where we were, <HI>I&s;abella</HI> told me &s;he had provided a Place where we might &s;end Letters to each other, without any Su&s;picion; &s;he wou'd &s;eek for an Opportunity after Din|ner to inform me, and if that &s;hou'd not hap|pen, &s;he wou'd contrive to let me know by a Line before to-morrow Morning.</P>
<P>After Dinner, <HI>I&s;abella</HI> and I were engag|'d, much again&s;t our Inclination, to make up a Set at <HI>Quadrille</HI>; and, to add to our Morti|fication, we were oblig'd to part without any further Opportunity of Conver&s;e. How|ever, I was forc'd to keep up a chearful
<PB N="291" REF="297">
Countenance, that my Uncle might not &s;u|&s;pect the Chagrin I felt. The Night prov'd as di&s;agreeable a one to me, as the Evening; and I cou'd not get any Re&s;t, till it was al|mo&s;t time to ri&s;e. As I was dre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, my Servant told me there was a Boy at the Door, had brought me a Pre&s;ent of a Brace of Partridges; I order'd him to come in; when I ask'd him from whence they came, he told me he had a Note in his Pocket wou'd inform me. As &s;oon as I receiv'd it, I &s;oon knew the dear Character to be <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s. When I had di&s;mi&s;s'd the Boy, I open'd the Note, and found the Contents as follows:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I left you Ye&s;terday, I carry'd Di&s;content home with me, which never left me till Sleep (which was &s;low in coming to my Aid) drove it away. Whenever you have any Time hangs heavy on your Hands, you may write an Account of your Home-Travels, and direct 'em to Mrs. <HI>Jane Stubbs,</HI> at &mdash; The poor Woman has the Misfortune of wanting the U&s;e of Letters, and always brings 'em to me to read; therefore whatever comes to her Hands, will be &s;ure to come to mine. I &s;hall &s;ay no more (my Time being &s;hort) but this, I care not
<PB N="292" REF="298">
how much Trouble the good Woman gives me; &s;o that you may write to her as &s;oon as you plea&s;e, who will bring it to one who is entirely</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>Yours,</HI> &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The Plea&s;ure this little Note gave me, was partly taken from me, in that I did not de|tain the Boy to &s;end an An&s;wer. Yet, upon &s;econd Thoughts, I imagin'd it wou'd be &s;a|fer to carry one my&s;elf. I was &s;oon deter|min'd, wrote one, and went to the Hou&s;e, and was there before the Boy, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, might loiter by the way. This Woman was a Tenant of the divine <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s, and had for|merly been her Nur&s;e; &s;he cou'd not be &s;aid to love her Mi&s;tre&s;s, but rather doated on her. This Creature was the Picture of Ho|ne&s;ty; and &s;he was &s;o well a&s;&s;ur'd of her young Lady's Conduct, &s;he made no Scruple to tell me, the Letters I wou'd honour her with, &s;hou'd faithfully be convey'd to the proper Hands. Why then to begin, &s;aid I, there's one, I don't care how &s;oon it was where it &s;hou'd be. I don't think it proper till after Dinner, reply'd the good Woman; for tho' I am ever welcome at my young Landlady's Mother's, yet, as I have not been come long from thence, I think it will not
<PB N="293" REF="299">
be quite &s;o well to go &s;o &s;oon. I agreed with her in that Particular, and took my Leave: fir&s;t making her a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent; for tho' tho&s;e &s;ort of People may continue un|corruptively hone&s;t, yet it is as well, when it is made their Intere&s;t to be &s;o.</P>
<P>The next Day my Uncle re&s;olv'd we &s;hou'd make a Vi&s;it to my Father and Mother, and I was of the Opinion it wou'd be highly pro|per, as well as a De&s;ire I had to &s;ee how the Family went on. When we arriv'd there, we found every thing according to our Wi&s;hes. There was &s;uch a Harmony between my Fa|ther and my Mother, that my Father told my Uncle, &s;miling, his Wife's late Illne&s;s had mended her Temper prodigiou&s;ly, and he wou'd not have her be indi&s;pos'd in the &s;ame manner again, for ever &s;o much; for if, &s;aid he, &s;he &s;hou'd, and be better in propor|tion, &s;he wou'd be too good for him, and only fit for Heaven. We found every thing &s;o much to our Liking, that we took our Leave of 'em with a great deal of Satisfac|tion; and my Uncle told me, as we were go|ing home, that Miracles were not ceas'd, for there was an ill Woman mended.</P>
<P>The next Day we &s;et out on our intended Progre&s;s, and met with nothing extraordinary
<PB N="294" REF="300">
in our Cour&s;e; only one Thing I thought was odd enough. In a &s;mall Village, near the Sea-Coa&s;t in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> as we were at Church on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> with a full Congregation, a Man came to the Church-Door, and cry'd out, <HI>A Wreck! A Wreck!</HI> The Congregation im|mediately unbuckled their Devotions, and were crouding out as fast as they cou'd, tho' the Par&s;on had not gone thro' half his Ser|mon. When the good Man found they were going to leave him to fini&s;h his Sermon by him&s;elf, he call'd to 'em with an audible Voice, de&s;iring his Audience to hear <HI>one</HI> Word before they went: Upon his earne&s;t Entrea|ty, mo&s;t of 'em turn'd about to hear the <HI>one</HI> Word. When the Par&s;on found they &s;eem'd willing to hear him, he cry'd out, <HI>Pray, good Folks, let us &s;tart fair!</HI> and upon that, pre&s;t to the Door with all the Expedition he cou'd, and, in a few Minutes, my Uncle and I might have robb'd the Church, for there was not a Soul to hinder us. The Oddity of the Thing very much &s;urpriz'd us, tho' it often made us merry afterwards. Well, <HI>Will,</HI> &s;aid my Un|cle (when the Church was empty) we may as well &s;ay our Prayers at home, as &s;tay here by our&s;elves. What, Sir, &s;aid I, have you no Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Proceeding of this wild
<PB N="295" REF="301">
Congregation? Why, I cannot &s;ay but I have, reply'd my Uncle; let us get our Hor&s;es and follow 'em. When we came to the Gentleman's where we lay, a Friend of my Uncle's, we found the Hou&s;e as empty as the Church; for they were all gone upon the &s;ame De&s;ign, and my Tutor, with our Servants along with 'em, as we &s;uppos'd. So we were forc'd to be our own Grooms, and follow'd 'em. We cou'd not well mi&s;s our Way, for we &s;aw People from all Quarters running before us. When we came within Sight of the Sea, we cou'd perceive &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els labouring to keep from the Shore, with all their Art and Indu&s;try; for the Wind was very high, and blew right a&s;hore, as the Sailors term it. But what Horror had I in my Mind, to &s;ee in what Anxiety the Wretches on Shore were, for fear they &s;hou'd e&s;cape, and &s;ave them&s;elves. At la&s;t, one of 'em bulg'd upon the Rocks, and &s;plit in Pie|ces, at which Sight the Barbarians (for I can term 'em no le&s;s) gave a Shout, and threw one another down for Eagerne&s;s, who &s;hou'd be foremo&s;t, not the lea&s;t regarding the poor unfortunate Wretches plung'd in the Waves. But my Uncle and I, with my Tutor, and our Servants (that were there before us) gave
<PB N="296" REF="302">
'em all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance we cou'd, and with much Trouble, and &s;ome Hazard, &s;av'd Five out of Eight that were in the Ve&s;&s;el; tho' with many a hearty Cur&s;e for our Pains; for it &s;eems they cou'd not make the Ve&s;&s;el a Wreck, if there were any of the Crew alive. However, the inhuman Brutes fell to &s;e|curing every thing as fa&s;t as ever they cou'd, while we carry'd the poor Shipwreck'd Wretches to the next Village, to give 'em &s;ome Refre&s;hment. The Ve&s;&s;el was a <HI>French|man,</HI> laden with Wine, which they brought to exchange for Corn, the common Cu&s;tom of all the Sea-Coa&s;t contiguous to <HI>France</HI>; which may prove a pernicious Cu&s;tom, if the Produce of Grain &s;hou'd ever fail us in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We took our Leaves that Evening of my Uncle's Friend, who, in my Opinion, &s;eem'd very glad to be rid of us, for he was as bu|&s;y about the Wreck, as any of the re&s;t. A few Miles farther, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el was ca&s;t a|way, and all the unhappy Sailors drown'd. Our Road lying through the &s;ame Place three Days afterwards, &s;everal People had &s;old Part of a new Fount of Letter, of the <HI>Greek</HI> Al|phabet, at a Penny <HI>per</HI> Pound, as wa&s;te Me|tal, when perhaps the Purcha&s;er had paid
<PB N="297" REF="303">
fifty times more for it. What Brutes are the&s;e Wretches! Had they been their own Countrymen, it had been the &s;ame. What Horror mu&s;t it be to the poor Sailors, when having weather'd many a Storm, and perhaps e&s;cap'd from their Enemies, to come in Sight of their native Country, and peri&s;h for want of timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance from their Countrymen, who wi&s;h for nothing more than their Deaths. What can the wor&s;t of the Savage Kind do more? Nay, I have been inform'd, that to make a Ve&s;&s;el a Wreck, they have often murder'd the poor Sailors that have been &s;truggling for Life, lifting their Hands in vain for Succour, to tho&s;e that have prov'd their Murderers. We ought not to condemn the Heatheni&s;h <HI>Indians,</HI> that &s;erve the <HI>Europeans</HI> in the &s;ame manner, who do it from the Love of Liberty, who ima|gine (and not unju&s;tly) that the <HI>Europeans</HI> come to en&s;lave 'em. The&s;e Reflexions ca&s;t a Melancholy upon our whole Company for &s;ome time after, and the Diver&s;ity of new Objects cou'd hardly wipe away the Thoughts of the other. When my Uncle ask'd a Far|mer in that Neighbourhood, how he cou'd be &s;o inhuman to feed on the Lo&s;s of his Fellow-Creatures? he an&s;wer'd, if it were not
<PB N="298" REF="304">
now and then for &s;uch a lucky Hit, he &s;hou'd never be able to pay his Landlord his Rent; be&s;ides, Cu&s;tom had made it natural to him, and he cou'd not call that a Crime, &s;o generally follow'd by all his Neighbours. All we cou'd &s;ay, cou'd not make him think of leaving off &s;o profitable a Perqui&s;ite, as he was pleas'd to term it. Which put me in mind of tho&s;e excellent Ver&s;es of <HI>Wal|ler</HI>'s.</P>
<Q><L>Bold were the Men who on the Ocean fir&s;t</L>
<L>Spread their new Sails, when Shipwreck was the wor&s;t;</L>
<L>More Dangers now from Man alone we find,</L>
<L>Than from the Rocks, the Billows, or the Wind.</L></Q>
<P>Some few Days after, my good Tutor was attack'd with a violent Fever, which we imagin'd he had got by endeavouring to &s;ave the poor &s;hipwreck'd People, tho' we were all as much wet with the Billows of the Sea, as he was. This Accident &s;topt us at <HI>St. Ed|mund's-Bury</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> &s;everal Days, and tho' my Uncle &s;par'd no Co&s;t for his Reco|very, yet the good Man expir'd, to the great Grief of us all. We bury'd him decently, tho' privately, not without wetting his Grave
<PB N="299" REF="305">
with my Tears, for he was a Per&s;on that de&s;erv'd, and had a great Share in my Friend|&s;hip.</P>
<P>After his Funeral, we &s;et our&s;elves forward for Home; and for my own Part, with a heavy Heart; and my Uncle &s;eem'd very much griev'd, becau&s;e he ever expre&s;s'd a great deal of Satisfaction in tru&s;ting to him the Conduct of my Youth in my Tour of <HI>Europe.</HI> Yet the Imagination of my Travels being retarded for &s;ome time, gave me &s;ome Plea|&s;ure, becau&s;e I &s;hou'd have the Happine&s;s of &s;eeing my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI> longer. When we came home, <HI>Betty</HI> inform'd me my Mother-in-law had made her a Vi&s;it, and expre&s;s'd &s;uch a Horror at my former Treatment, that they did nothing but weep all Day. She made her &s;everal Pre&s;ents, and &s;eem'd very much pleas'd at her Settlement in my Un|cle's Family. But the Idea of my charm|ing <HI>I&s;abella</HI> took up all my Thoughts, and fatigu'd as I was, I &s;ent her the following Let|ter, as &s;oon as I di&s;mounted.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FAIREST,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Thoughts of You, took from me all the Satisfaction I &s;hou'd have receiv'd from the Variety of Objects that oppos'd my

View. Every thing I &s;aw, put me in mind of you. The Ro&s;es and Lilies, were Remem|brancers of your amiable Face; the Down of Swans, of the Whitene&s;s and Softne&s;s of your Skin; when I heard the Warbling of the Night|ingale, it put me in mind of your Voice; the Dove, of your &s;oft Di&s;po&s;ition; and the &s;oar|ing Lark, of that compleat Beauty that &s;ur|mounts all other Women's, as that &s;urmounts the Soaring of all other Birds.

What &s;hall I &s;ay to expre&s;s my Pa&s;&s;ion? The Sun, the Moon, the Day, and Night, all put me in mind of you; and the Griefs I feel at our near Sepa|ration, almo&s;t rend my Heart a&s;under.

</LETTER>
<P>As we were going the next Day to dine at <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Mother's, my Uncle receiv'd a Let|ter from a di&s;tant Relation, which he gave me to read:
<LETTER>
<PB N="304" REF="310">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNder&s;tanding Mr. <HI>Meredith,</HI> my young Cou&s;in's Tutor, is dead, I take the Li|berty to recommend a young Gentleman to you, who, I dare prowi&s;e, will an&s;wer every thing you de&s;ire from &s;uch a Per&s;on. He &s;hall wait on you to-morrow. I choo&s;e to give you this early Notice; for fear you &s;hou'd provide your|&s;elf. He under&s;tands the dead Languages, as well as the modi&s;h Living. Mi&s;take me not, I mean all the <HI>European</HI> Tongues, but <HI>Low Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covite,</HI> which, I pre&s;ume, you will have but little Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your affectionate Kin&s;man, N. L.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>After I had read the Letter, my Uncle told me, it was from a Per&s;on he cou'd very well confide in, and his Recommendation was &s;ufficient to him; however, <HI>Billy,</HI> &s;aid my Uncle, you &s;hall &s;ee the Gentleman, for this is your Affair: If you can't like him, I won't force him upon you, no more than I wou'd do a Wife. Well, Sir, &s;aid I, to|morrow will decide that; tho' I am apt to
<PB N="305" REF="311">
believe I &s;hall like him as well as you do. I am glad to find he is not a Man in Years; for they are generally &s;o ill-natur'd, the Pre|cepts they teach us favour too much of Se|verity. And very often, reply'd my Uncle, Youth borders too much upon Levity. However, I have told you, more than once, that I &s;hall leave you to your own Di&s;cre|tion.</P>
<P>When we came to the Hou&s;e, we found the Company together in the Parlour, and the Cloth laid ready for Dinner. I am glad you're come, &s;aid <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Mother, for we are oblig'd to dine very early, becau&s;e, after Dinner, we are to make a formal Vi&s;it to a Neighbour Lady, but we &s;hall leave <HI>I&s;abella</HI> to entertain you. You may imagine, I felt no little Joy, when I under&s;tood <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was to be left behind; and the Freedom of my Humour had almo&s;t betray'd my Content|ment, for I was rally'd both by the Mother and Aunt. Nay, my Uncle cou'd not help having a Fling at me. Why, good Ladies, &s;aid my Uncle, don't be too hard upon my Nephew; do you imagine a young Lad pa&s;t Fifteen, cares a Fig for Womens Company looking hard towards Forty. No, no, it's very &s;eldom Youth and Age can agree, except
<PB N="306" REF="312">
Youth is very &s;ober indeed; or Age is not tinctur'd with its old Di&s;temper, Peevi&s;h|ne&s;s, with a Hatred of all Mirth. Ay, but (I reply'd) we find nothing of that in this good Company; there's none here forgets they were once young. Very true, return'd the Mother, your Uncle, I believe, imagines he is as young now, as he was thirty Years ago. Pray &s;peak for your&s;elf, Madam, re|turn'd my Uncle, you are as unwilling as I am, to be reckon'd in the Catalogue of Old. Why &s;ure, reply'd the Aunt, my Si&s;ter has not quite &s;o many Years over her Head, as your Wor&s;hip! No, nor &s;o much Expe|rience neither, return'd my Uncle. Dinner coming in, ended this Di&s;pute. And after it was over, the Mother and Aunt went to their &s;everal Chambers to dre&s;s; and my Un|cle went to &s;leep in the Summer-Hou&s;e; &s;o I was left alone with the divine <HI>I&s;abella.</HI> We &s;aid all our young Hearts conceiv'd, and I thought my&s;elf the happie&s;t of Mortals. But when I touch'd upon my Ab&s;ence for &s;o long a time, &s;he begg'd we might do &s;omething to divert that terrible Thought; for if &s;he gave her&s;elf leave to look into her Brea&s;t, &s;he was a&s;&s;ur'd, &s;uch a Torrent of Tears wou'd fol|low, that her Sorrow wou'd be taken Notice
<PB N="307" REF="313">
of by the Company, and perhaps the Cau&s;e of Grief &s;urmis'd, if not in reality found out. Therefore, &s;aid &s;he, to divert the Thought, let us play a Party at Picquet. My Uncle, Madam, I reply'd, will not forgo his After|noon's Nap, for any thing, therefore we mu&s;t play by our&s;elves. Before we had play'd out one Game, the Ladies came down, and the Coach being ready, drove away to their Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>When they were gone, I cou'd not refrain opening my whole Soul to <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who felt the Pangs of Parting as &s;harp as my&s;elf, and her lovely Face was all bedew'd with Tears. We were &s;o long in this tender Scene of Parting, that my Uncle had fini&s;h'd his Sleep, and was coming towards us. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> at the Sight of him, was oblig'd to retire to hide her Tears; and I was forc'd to have Recour&s;e to <HI>Otway</HI>'s <HI>Orphan,</HI> to have a Pre|tence for the Gloom that was &s;ettled upon my Countenance. Why how now, young Man, &s;aid my Uncle, when he enter'd, what all alone, and melancholy? Yes, Sir, &s;aid I, I never can read the la&s;t Act of this Play, without being &s;en&s;ibly touch'd with the Ca|ta&s;trophe. Pr'ythee read Comedies then, &s;aid my Uncle, for I will not have you &s;ad.
<PB N="308" REF="314">
Sir, &s;aid I, I can't find many Comedies fit to read; for tho&s;e that are good, I have read &s;o often, I'm as well acquainted with them as the Authors, or Actors in them. What's become of the young Lady, &s;aid my Un|cle, have you not Rhetorick enough to keep her here? So it &s;eems, Sir, &s;aid I, for &s;he is retir'd. Well then, &s;aid my Uncle, &s;ince we are alone, and the Time &s;hort we &s;hall be together, let me give you a little Advice before we part; for it is not an Improbabi|lity, when we part, we may part for ever. I find, Sir, &s;aid I, you intend to increa&s;e my Melancholy, for if I thought that, by my Con&s;ent, we wou'd never part. Never the nearer Death for talking of it, neither, re|turn'd my Uncle. But what I am going to &s;ay to you, I wou'd have you often think on, to &s;trengthen your Mind in Virtue.</P>
<P>When you have chang'd your Climate, don't change your Nature, but always think <HI>England</HI> your native Country; and not like &s;ome young Gentlemen that I know, who return with a Contempt for their own Coun|try, with their Under&s;tandings like a Fool's Coat, patch'd all over, and nothing of the Ground &s;een. Never &s;tay long at a Place; for even <HI>Rome,</HI> with the Help of Books
<PB N="309" REF="315">
which de&s;cribe their Antiquities, may be &s;een in three Months, as well as &s;o many Years. Conver&s;e with elder People than your &s;elf, for their Knowledge will increa&s;e yours; and do not, as I know &s;ome of our Countrymen do, becau&s;e they are brought up in the Pro|te&s;tant Religion, avoid all Conver&s;ation with the Clergy abroad; for when I travell'd, I found among all their Holy Bodies, Men of the profounde&s;t Learning and Judgment, who never attempted to make me a Pro&s;e|lyte, or gave me any Unea&s;ine&s;s about my Religion. I wou'd have you go into all Companies, but take care of being too parti|cular. Make no Intimates, but as many Friends as you can. The <HI>French</HI> have too much Levity, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> too much Mo|ro&s;ene&s;s, the <HI>Italians</HI> too much Jealou&s;y, and addicted to overmuch Plea&s;ure without Mirth; the <HI>Germans,</HI> tho' learned, love the Juice of the Grape too well; and the <HI>Dutch</HI> are all Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s; tho' there is no general Rule without an Exception. Always live &s;oberly; for as you will be frequently chang|ing Place, a &s;pare Diet will be&s;t agree with your Con&s;titution, and will learn you never to be di&s;appointed, If Heaven &s;hou'd af|flict you with Sickne&s;s, take my Method.
<PB N="310" REF="316">
Send for the mo&s;t eminent of the Profe&s;&s;ion, tell him your Stay in that Place is but &s;hort, and agree with him for &s;uch a Sum when you are thoroughly cur'd. This Management, will make it his Intere&s;t to &s;et you upon your Legs as fa&s;t as he can. You mu&s;t hire a Native Servant at every Place you intend to make any Stay at. Give him good Wages, but tru&s;t him not; let him know as little of your Affairs as po&s;&s;ible; and keep him igno|rant of your next Station, and the Time you intend to &s;et forth; for &s;ome of 'em, I have prov'd, are Confederates with Robbers, and are as inqui&s;itive after Foreigners, as &s;ome Foreigners are after new Fa&s;hions. The Va|riety of Dre&s;s (I mean Fa&s;hions) is what I abhor; yet you mu&s;t put your&s;elf in the Garb of every Place you make any Stay at. It will not only prevent your being gaz'd at, but will ingratiate you with the Natives, when you take their Habit upon you. Hear much, and &s;peak little. Be not too intimate with the <HI>Feminine Gender</HI>; for an Intimacy there, too often creates Di&s;content and Trou|ble. Be very cautious in making Acquain|tance with your own Countrymen, for mo&s;t of 'em now-a-Days enter into Society, to en|ter into all the fa&s;hionable Vices of the Places
<PB N="311" REF="317">
they go thro'. Be like the indu&s;trious Bee, &s;uck Honey from every Flower, and contemn the gaudy Weeds that bloom and flouri&s;h to no U&s;e. Avoid all Quarrels; but if you &s;hou'd unhappily fall into one, behave your &s;elf with Courage and Re&s;olution; and if you &s;hou'd &s;ucceed, don't let your Sword hang the loo&s;er in its Scabbard. A Man of true Spirit will be as cautious how he draws his Sword, as he wou'd be of treading in the Dark over Heaps of Ruins. Be cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ious of every one you deal with, for in many Places they make it a common Practice to over|reach Foreigners; and the fairer their Looks, often the fouler their Hearts. Whenever you come to have your Equipage examin'd by Officers of the Cu&s;toms, make a hand&s;ome Pre&s;ent beforehand, which will either prevent their giving you any Trouble, or at lea&s;t will prevent their tumbling your Things, which often proves of more Damage, than the Pre|&s;ent you make 'em comes to. When you go by Sea, as you mu&s;t, to arrive at &s;everal Places of <HI>Italy,</HI> bargain with the Ma&s;ter of the Ve&s;&s;el before you imbark; but pay him not before you arrive at the End of your Voyage; nor then, till all your Things are brought to your Lodgings, to an&s;wer your
<PB N="312" REF="318">
Bill of Parcels; and be &s;ure you have two drawn at the &s;ame time, one for the Ma&s;ter, and the other for your&s;elf. When you are to imbark, if you can, get a Recommendation from the la&s;t Place you leave; or, if you can|not, enquire out &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> (for there is no fear of finding 'em at all the noted Places) and beg he wou'd recommend you to &s;ome Native of the Place, where you may re&s;ide; for I have often made it my Ob&s;ervation, to have more Re&s;pect &s;hewn me, when I took up my Quarters at one of the Natives, than when I did at one of my own Countrymen's. Tho' it is po&s;&s;ible I may get you &s;everal re|commendatory Letters. One I am &s;ure of, from the worthy Per&s;on that we receiv'd a Letter from this Morning concerning your new Tutor; he was Envoy at <HI>Florence</HI> two Years, and has a good Acquaintance in &s;eve|ral Courts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Now, &s;aid my Un|cle, giving me a Paper, here is written the Heads of what I have been &s;peaking, which I wou'd have you read over once a Week. And I de&s;ire I may hear from you all Op|portunities, with a &s;uccinct Account of every thing worth Notice you &s;ee abroad. It will &s;erve to kill &s;ome Part of your Time that may hang heavy on your Hands. Be&s;ides, it will be acceptable to me.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="319">We had &s;everal other Di&s;cour&s;es on the &s;ame Subject; but we were interrupted by the Arrival of the Mother and Aunt. They got into a Chat, no way agreeable to me, of their Vi&s;it, which gave me an Opportunity of looking after my dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> who I had ob&s;erv'd &s;ome time before, to go into the Garden. I found her in a by Summer-Hou&s;e, bathing her lovely Cheeks in Tears. When &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he &s;trove to dry her Eyes, but freely confe&s;s'd, the Thoughts of Parting had rais'd that Sorrow in her. She told me, va|rious Objects and Climates might alter my young Heart, and wipe her out from thence. It was with much Per&s;ua&s;ion I cou'd &s;ettle her Mind to talk of any thing el&s;e; and tho' it gave me unconceivable Tran&s;ports to &s;ee the Strength of her Love, yet it was nece&s;|&s;ary we &s;hou'd have &s;ome time to &s;ettle our future Corre&s;pondence by Letter. When that was fini&s;h'd, I took my &s;olemn leave of her, not without &s;hedding Tears at our tender Se|paration. But poor <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Grief quite overcame her, &s;he fainted in my Arms. The tender Proof of her Heart, however, gave me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, left we &s;hou'd be di&s;co|ver'd, for it was &s;ome time before &s;he came to her&s;elf. When we had compos'd our&s;elves
<PB N="314" REF="320">
as well as we cou'd, we were troubled to find a Means or Pretence for <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s Tears, for there was no concealing her Grief from the Company within. At la&s;t &s;he told me, &s;he wou'd make 'em believe a Bee had &s;tung her Hand.</P>
<P>We went, with &s;ome Confu&s;ion, into the Parlour where they were &s;itting. <HI>I&s;abella</HI> was &s;oon di&s;cover'd to have been weeping. When &s;he was ask'd the Cau&s;e, &s;he told 'em, as &s;he went to pluck a Ro&s;e, a Bee, conceal'd, had &s;tung her. I thought you had more Philo&s;o|phy, reply'd my Uncle, young Lady, than to &s;hed Tears for Pain. Truly, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hall never be &s;o much a Stoick, to think Pain is all Fancy, for I am &s;ure I feel it &s;till. Well, reply'd my Uncle, you find, young Lady, the &s;weete&s;t thing &s;ometimes conceals a Sting. However, your Pain will not hold, you long, there is a Balm to cure it; Honey, and a little Time, will &s;oon ea&s;e you, I war|rant you. A while after, my Uncle order'd me to take my la&s;t Leave of the good Com|pany, which I did, with ten thou&s;and Pangs. But as I pre&s;t my Lips to tho&s;e of my dear <HI>I&s;abella</HI>'s, I found 'em tremble &s;o much, that I fear'd a Di&s;covery; yet &s;he bore it out|wardly very well; but did not come out to
<PB N="315" REF="321">
&s;ee us to the Coach, tho' no one took Notice of it but my&s;elf. 'Twas well the Dusk of Evening was approaching, for the Concern in my Countenance was not to be conceal'd; however, I compos'd my&s;elf as well as I cou'd before we came home.</P>
<P>The next Morning, the Gentleman that was to be my Tutor, arriv'd; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I took an Affection to him at fir&s;t Sight. His Countenance pleas'd me, as well as his Beha|viour; and my Uncle &s;eem'd as well pleas'd as my&s;elf. He was not above Five and Twen|ty, and tho' young enough for a Tutor, yet we found him old in Experience and Under|&s;tanding, and an&s;wer'd fully the Character the Letter gave my Uncle of him. My Uncle was &s;o well a&s;&s;ur'd of his Abilities, that he re&s;olv'd we &s;hou'd begin our Journey in two Days. In the mean time I wrote &s;everal Let|ters to my dear <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> and receiv'd An&s;wers &s;o tender and pa&s;&s;ionate, that my Heart felt all the Joy it cou'd de&s;ire; but that Joy was lo&s;t in the di&s;mal Thoughts of being &s;epara|ted from all my Soul held dear, &s;o long.</P>
<P>At length the Day came we were to &s;et out. My dear Uncle wou'd accompany me to <HI>Do|ver,</HI> where we arriv'd. But the Weather proving a little boi&s;terous, he wou'd not let
<PB N="316" REF="322" MS="y">
me imbark before it was &s;ettled, tho' the Ve&s;|&s;els &s;et Sail, as not regarding it; however, as it was his Tenderne&s;s and Good-Nature, I comply'd with his De&s;ire, tho' there was no apparent Danger.</P>
<P>The Sight of the Cliffs of <HI>Dover,</HI> put me in mind of tho&s;e Lines in <HI>King Lear,</HI> of our inimitable <HI>Shake&s;pear:</HI>
<Q><L>&mdash; How fearful</L>
<L>And dizzy 'tis, to ca&s;t one's Eyes below!</L>
<L>The Crows, and Choughs, that wing the midway Air,</L>

<L>The Fi&s;hermen that walk upon the Beech,</L>
<L>Appear like Mice. And you tall anchoring Bark</L>
<L>Seems le&s;&s;en'd to her Boat; her Boat, a Buoy</L>

<L>Cannot be heard &s;o high. I'll look no more,</L>
<L>Le&s;t my Brain turn, and the Di&s;order makes me</L>
<L>Fall headlong down.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next Day, the Weather prov'd &s;o calm, that the Sea look'd like poli&s;h'd Gla&s;s; or, as the Sailors &s;ay, <HI>&s;o &s;mooth, you might throw Dice upon't</HI>; therefore my Uncle, after ming|ling our Tears, gave me leave to embark, with my Tutor and one Servant; and we left the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Shore behind.</P>
