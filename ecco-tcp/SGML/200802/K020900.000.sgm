<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE favourable reception which the fol|lowing Comedy has met with from a candid and generous Public, calls for my warme&s;t acknowledgements; and tho' it may be of little con&s;equence to them to know the &s;ource of &s;o &s;light an amu&s;ement, I think my&s;elf bound by truth and gratitude to own, that the fir&s;t idea of this Piece was hinted to me by my ever-re&s;pected and lamented friend Mr. GARRICK, who mentioned GOLDONI's <HI>Bourru Bienfai&s;ant,</HI> as a &s;ketch that, if adapted to our times and manners, might be rendered plea&s;ing to an Engli&s;h Audience. Tho&s;e who have read the French Piece mu&s;t judge how far I have profited by GOLDONI's work; but of this I am certain, that had Mr. GARRICK lived to afford me that friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he has done on former occa&s;ions, my Comedy would have been more worthy of the reception with which it has been honoured. I will, however, hope that, <Q>with all its imperfec|tions on its head,</Q> the &s;ame indulgence which attended its repre&s;entation, will follow it into the clo&s;et; and that the Reader will allow me the only merit I pre&s;ume to claim, that of meaning well.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="4">
I gladly take this opportunity of returning my thanks to my much-e&s;teemed friend, Mr. SHERIDAN, &s;enior, for his kind attention to the getting up my Play, my ill health not permitting me to attend one Rehear&s;al. But Mr. SHERIDAN's friend&s;hip, wherever pro|fe&s;&s;ed, is not of modern growth.</P>
<P>I have more than common acknowledge|ments to make to all the Performers in my Comedy; particularly to Mrs. ABINGTON and Mi&s;s POPE, who both chearfully undertook Parts out of their u&s;ual line of acting, and in which they have both excelled. I &s;hould be utterly unable to expre&s;s my &s;entiments of Mr. KING, in the character of SIR WILLIAM WOODLEY, if I were not at liberty &s;eriou&s;ly to adopt the very words which he humorou&s;ly, but ju&s;tly, &s;peaks of him&s;elf, under a per&s;onated character, in <HI>The Critic:&mdash;</HI><Q>But it is impo&s;&s;ible for language to do ju&s;tice to Mr. KING! Indeed, he more than merited tho&s;e repeated bur&s;ts of applau&s;e which he drew from a mo&s;t bril|liant and judicious Audience.</Q></P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf, this little tribute to di&s;tin|gui&s;hed merit will not be deemed tedious or impertinent by the Public, for who&s;e opinion I have the &s;incere&s;t re&s;pect, and to whom I have the honour to be</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>Spoken by Mr. KING.</P>
<LG>
<L>TO glow with ardour, and attempt with zeal</L>
<L>The reformation of the public weal,</L>
<L>Is the high duty of the COMIC MUSE;</L>
<L>And tho' keen Attic Salt allowed to u&s;e,</L>
<L>To &s;ea&s;on Precept, and with Art to tickle</L>
<L>The &s;ores &s;he means to wa&s;h with &s;harpe&s;t pickle,</L>
<L>Yet not the ro&s;y, pulpited Divine,</L>
<L>Nor lank-hair'd Methodi&s;t with rueful whine,</L>
<L>Is more intent to root out Vice and Folly,</L>
<L>And make ye all lead lives di&s;creet and holy.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet why to clear the field were all their toil,</L>
<L>If weeds o'er&s;pread not the luxuriant &s;oil?</L>
<L>Congreve or We&s;ley, Whitfield or Moliere,</L>
<L>In vain might prompt the laugh, or bribe the tear,</L>
<L>If no man felt, or in him&s;elf, or neighbour,</L>
<L>Some failing to call forth the zealot's labour;&mdash;</L>
<L>If no fair dame de&s;cried, 'mid&s;t her acquaintance,</L>
<L>Some few who might be mended by repentance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Loo&s;e as the buxom air, the Youth from College</L>
<L>Comes fraught with all Newmarket's hopeful knowledge;</L>
<L>In ha&s;te to &s;pend the E&s;tate, not yet his own,</L>
<L>Compleats his ruin ere his beard is grown;</L>
<L>And when to foreign climes he &s;preads the &s;ail,</L>
<L>'Tis not to enlarge his mind, but '&s;cape a jail.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then ble&s;t the Poet, happy the Divine,</L>
<L>When Folly gives the <HI>Ton</HI> from Fa&s;hion's Shrine!</L>
<L>But whil&s;t the Prie&s;t and Satiri&s;t reprove</L>
<L>Tho&s;e vices which provoke the wrath of JOVE,</L>
<L>Our Author, like the patient Angler &s;itting</L>
<L>To catch &s;mall fry, for humbler palates &s;itting,</L>
<L>Has &s;erved a Meal, not &s;ea&s;oned high with crimes.&mdash;</L>
<L>Ta&s;te it, and if approved, applaud THE TIMES.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>Spoken by Mi&s;s FARREN.</P>
<LG>
<L>WHILE grave-paced Tragedy, with Oh's! and Starts!</L>
<L>Flies at high game, to move and mend your hearts,</L>
<L>We merrier folks, with &s;pirits blithe and jolly,</L>
<L>Ju&s;t perch upon &s;ome little &s;prig of folly:</L>
<L>For, in this Age, &s;o pious, cha&s;te, and grave,</L>
<L>To rail at Vice, mu&s;t &s;urely be to rave!</L>

<LG>
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
<L>Yet thanks to here and there a modi&s;h fool,</L>
<L>The COMIC MUSE may glean &s;ome ridicule.</L>
<L>Jews will be Jews, if dupes can yet be found,</L>
<L>And if one frail one's left on Engli&s;h ground,</L>
<L>She'll find a Phaeton and pair of ponies</L>
<L>To elope&mdash;for all men are not Maccaronies:&mdash;</L>
<L>Tho&s;e precious Dears, at lea&s;t, would make her wait&mdash;</L>

<LG>
<L>Our &s;ex&mdash;but &s;hall I charge the weaker kind?</L>
<L>Or can tho&s;e fail to &s;tray, who&s;e guides are blind!</L>
<L>Let men reform them&s;elves, they're our examples&mdash;</L>
<L>And goods prove &s;eldom better than their &s;amples.</L>
<L>In former times the gallant Briti&s;h Youth</L>
<L>Were formed for Chivalry, and Love, and Truth&mdash;</L>
<L>In &s;uch an Age, in &s;uch a virtuous Nation,</L>
<L>Love was in woman almo&s;t in&s;piration.&mdash;</L>
<L>But now, alas! I &s;peak without a je&s;t,</L>
<L>Women are not in&s;pired&mdash;they're but po&s;&s;e&s;t.</L>
<L>Men are our pilots! They &s;hould mark the &s;helves;</L>

<P>Ridiculous, indeed!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me di&s;po&s;e of them for you, then. I'll be your Auctioneer, and try if I can't emblazon their pedigree with a little of that true humour which Charles Surface be&s;tows on his ance&s;tors, when he &s;ets up their pictures to &s;ale. Bucephalus, the fa|mous Bucephalus, Gentlemen, de&s;cended in a right line from the renowned quadrupede of that name, which had the honour of carrying a greater brute than him&s;elf&mdash;the immortal Alexander&mdash;</P>

<P>You had better con&s;ult Tatter&s;all, for their pedigree, as he is your only herald in tho&s;e points. Heigh-ho!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heigh-ho! This is but poor encourage|ment for me to enter on my new profe&s;&s;ion. Surely there is &s;omething malignant in the air, at pre&s;ent; for every man I have conver&s;ed with, this morning, &s;eems rather to be depre&s;&s;ed with the gloom of November, than enlivened by the &s;un&s;hine of April. I have ju&s;t now left Jack Knightly and Will Carele&s;s calculating, not their nativities, but their deaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;aw them both at Boodle's, ye&s;terday, in good health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not the more likely to live, for that, I a&s;|&s;ure you. However, it was not their natural exi&s;t|ence,
<PB N="5" REF="11">
but their nece&s;&s;ary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, that employed their mathematics.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>You a&s;toni&s;h me!&mdash;Why, it is but lately they came into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of great e&s;tates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>True:&mdash;but then they have travelled the modern &s;hort and ea&s;y road to ruin, of granting annuities for this twelvemonth pa&s;t, and are now &s;o nearly arrived at the la&s;t &s;tage of their journey, that I think Jack &s;aid he had but two months to run; and Will flattered him&s;elf, that as the &s;ummer was approaching, he might be able to hold out four. I advi&s;ed their compounding the terms, and run|ning together for three months each.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor fellows! I am &s;orry for them. <STAGE>(a&s;ide.)</STAGE> Would I could promi&s;e my&s;elf even &s;o long a reprieve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! moping again, Woodley? You'll infect me, if I &s;tay.&mdash;Where are the Ladies?&mdash;In truth, my vi&s;it was to them, for I &s;carce hoped to find you here. Are Lady Mary and your &s;i&s;ter vi&s;ible? or &s;hall I pa&s;s on to your Uncle's apartment, and pay my re&s;pects to him? I think there is a door of communication to his hou&s;e from this room. Shall I go this way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be a &s;ervice of danger, Colonel; for I fear Sir William is not at pre&s;ent much delighted either with his vicinity, or affinity, to any of this family, except my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear you can except my &s;weet Loui&s;a; for, notwith&s;tanding the bru&s;quene&s;s of his manners, I have &s;uch an opinion of the old Knight's good &s;en&s;e and good nature, that I cannot readily acquit tho&s;e he is offended with, as wholly free from blame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;ub&s;cribe to your cen&s;ure, as far as it relates to my&s;elf; but the a&s;perity of his behaviour to Lady Mary, renders me extremely unhappy; and not even my pa&s;t obligations, or future pro&s;pects,
<PB N="6" REF="12">
&s;hall ever make me acquie&s;ce in his treating my wife with di&s;re&s;pect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>Allow me to &s;ay, Woodley, that per&s;ons &s;o nearly connected, ought to di&s;pen&s;e with ceremony, in favour of &s;incerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Woodley.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a dangerous tenet, Colonel, and may be extended 'till downright rudene&s;s may be con&s;idered but as the privilege of family-chat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you have no cau&s;e for &s;uch an appre|hen&s;ion, in this ca&s;e, as Sir William is quite as &s;ingular for goodne&s;s of heart, as for a deficiency in that outward varni&s;h which too often &s;upplies the place of it. But to compound the argument, let us admit there may be faults on both &s;ides.</P>

<P>I am glad to find you &s;till a lover, Mr. Woodley; but I who am but a friend, in this que&s;|tion, can't help thinking, that if Lady Mary had &s;pent more of her time in Dor&s;et&s;hire, and le&s;s at Spa, Paris, and other places of di&s;&s;ipation and ex|travagance, &s;he would have been more entitled to Sir William's e&s;teem, and you would have had le&s;s need of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<P>I AM no drinking man my&s;elf, Belford; but yet I do not approve of this water &s;y&s;tem of yours. It keeps the &s;pirits too low&mdash;</P>

<SP>

<P>To &s;ay or do any thing mad or fooli&s;h, I grant it may. But if water does not rai&s;e, it never depre&s;&s;es the &s;pirits. Can you &s;ay as much for your generous wine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I won't di&s;pute with you, becau&s;e I hate argument; and as you are an hone&s;t fellow, I can venture to take my gla&s;s chearfully in your company, tho' you don't partake of my liquor.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have made no vows, Sir William; and to humour a friend can ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;e with rules of my own making: So here's your fair niece, Loui&s;a Woodley, in a bumper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, thank you, my good friend! She is a mo&s;t excellent girl, and I like to have her toa&s;ted by &s;uch a man as you. I wi&s;h &s;he was well &s;ettled, with all my heart.</P>

<P>There can be no doubt of her marrying to advantage. She is a fine young woman, with a fine fortune.</P>

<P>And &s;o may be &s;acrificed to &s;ome fine young man, that may &s;pend her fortune in finery, as her hopeful brother has done, and leave her a beg|gar.

<P>Who told you that he was a <HI>young man of fa&s;hion?</HI> Why, Sir, there have been no <HI>men</HI> born, at lea&s;t, for the&s;e la&s;t thirty years&mdash;all monkies and macaronies. No Hearts of Oak, now, Belford,&mdash;all dwindled, dwindled into a&s;pens!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your &s;arca&s;m is rather too general, my good friend. Courage is the birth-right of an Engli&s;hman, and while one acre of our &s;oil remains, both the Oak and the Laurel will thrive on it.&mdash;We mu&s;t not prejudge the ri&s;ing generation; and I have not the lea&s;t doubt but your niece will make a very proper choice.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Belford.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, the &s;tronge&s;t in the world, if my happine&s;s is to be purcha&s;ed at the expence of another's mi&s;ery.&mdash;But I am wrong for being &s;erious, when I am certain you do but je&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>In the fir&s;t place, Sir, I never &s;aid any thing in je&s;t, &s;ince I was born.&mdash;And, &s;econdly, Sir, I never was more in earne&s;t, in the whole cour&s;e of my life. I therefore reque&s;t from you a &s;erious an&s;wer.&mdash;Je&s;t, indeed! No, truly, Coun&s;ellor, I am no joker.</P>
