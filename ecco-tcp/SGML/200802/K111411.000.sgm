<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE EDITOR of this Voyage, which has already pa&s;t through Three Edi|tions, with the approbation of tho&s;e who were companions in the expedition, and &s;harers in the dangers of it, has &s;till the farther &s;atisfaction, on comparing the origi|nal journal with that now publi&s;hed by authority, to find the facts and dates, the latitudes and longitudes (tho&s;e e&s;&s;entials of a Voyage undertaken for Di&s;covery) &s;o exactly to corre&s;pond, as could hardly have been ex|pected from journals kept on board the &s;ame &s;hip by different ob&s;ervers, who had no com|munication with each other.&mdash;No greater proof is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h its authenticity.</P>
<P>Our Journali&s;t appears to have been a man, who, to great profe&s;&s;ional &s;kill, had added all the requi&s;ites of an in&s;tructive Voyager. At|tentive to every material tran&s;action on board his own &s;hip, he had been careful to inform him&s;elf of every thing that affected the Voy|age, on board the other.</P>
<P>When in harbour, the manners, the cu&s;|toms, the virtues and the vices, the arts and manufactures of the inhabitants of the dif|ferent
<PB REF="4">
countries; their productions, animal and vegetable, &s;eem to have been no le&s;s the objects of his enquiry.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t other ob&s;ervations, even the errors committed in the progre&s;s of the Voyage, does not e&s;cape him; nor does he fail to expre&s;s his admiration of tho&s;e wonderful powers, that, amid&s;t innumerable difficulties into which &s;ome ca&s;ual mi&s;takes had involved the fate of both &s;hips, could &s;urmount every ob&s;tacle that &s;tood in the way of accompli&s;h|ing the fir&s;t object of the Voyage; in&s;omuch, that before the la&s;t fatal mi&s;carriage that de|prived the Commander in Chief of his life, the way was &s;moothed, and every thing put on &s;uch a footing, as to afford well-grounded hopes of a happy i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t a&s;toni&s;h the world, if any thing can a&s;toni&s;h the navigating world, that <HI>one</HI> year being lo&s;t, in which a third of the pro|vi&s;ions for a <HI>three years</HI> Voyage, was con|&s;umed, as it were, in wa&s;te, without the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;upplying the chief articles of an Engli&s;h &s;eaman's &s;ub&s;i&s;tence at &s;ea (namely, beef, bread, flour, &s;pirits, and tobacco) the Voyage could, notwith&s;tanding, be protract|ed for four years, without a man &s;uffering by hunger; and but four men dying of any di&s;ea&s;e whatever.</P>
<P>Of the adventures of tho&s;e who performed the Voyage, little is related in the work publi&s;hed by authority: and, if we except
<PB REF="5">
the de&s;ertion of the petty officer and mate from the &s;hips at Ulitea, with the vain hope of a&s;piring at principalities in Otaheite, and the unexpected meeting with the Ru&s;&s;ians at Oonala&s;ka, we meet with nothing calculated either to excite plea&s;ure or move pain, till the unfortunate death of Capt. Cook.</P>
<P>Our Voyager, however, has not been un|mindful of what the public had a right to expect, from Voyagers who had vi&s;ited and re-vi&s;ited every corner of the earth, and who had not been in&s;en&s;ible to the charms of the young females, with whom they mu&s;t have had &s;o many opportunities to conver&s;e; but, to all that has been related in the <HI>&s;olid</HI> nar|rative of Capt. Cook, not a circum&s;tance of which has been omitted, he has added others, which though a little partaking of the mar|vellous, have yet their foundation in incon|trovertible truth.</P>
<P>But in this Preface, as it is not our in|tention to anticipate the plea&s;ure the Reader will undoubtedly receive in the peru&s;al of this &s;mall volume, we &s;hall only ju&s;t pre|mi&s;e, that it is not an abridgement, or an ab&s;tract, from the work publi&s;hed by au|thority; but a di&s;tinct original work, au|thenticated by a compari&s;on with that writ|ten by the Captains Cook and King, and agreeing with them in the e&s;&s;ential points of di&s;covery; and containing many particulars unnoticed in their narrative, without which
<PB REF="6">
the account of the Voyage mu&s;t be incom|pleat.</P>
<P>If the Editor may claim any merit for the part he has taken in the performance, it is in collecting together in the introduction, a &s;hort, and, he hopes, not an unentertaining &s;ummary of all the Voyages undertaken for <HI>di&s;covery only,</HI> in both the Southern and Northern Hemi&s;pheres, and in both the Pa|cific and Atlantic Oceans. It were needle&s;s to enumerate the many volumes con&s;ulted on this occa&s;ion. The intelligent Reader will bear te&s;timony to not a few. But for the latter Voyages of Lieutenants Picker&s;gill and Young, he mu&s;t acknowledge him&s;elf indebted to the Editor of the Voyage pub|li&s;hed by authority.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>TWO illu&s;trious foreigners, Columbus and Magellan, rendered their names immortal, at an early period, by opening an immen&s;e field for di&s;covery and the improvement of Navigation; but it has been re&s;erved for a di&s;tingui&s;hed native of this country, and of this age, to fix the boun|daries of the globe, and to complete the great plan of nautical inve&s;tigation. The two la&s;t fell in the pro&s;ecution of the important di&s;coveries;&mdash;the fir&s;t, &s;urvived only to experience the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and to <HI>feel</HI> the re&s;entment of an un|grateful court.</P>
<P>Columbus, by a per&s;everance, of which there was then no precedent, very providentially &s;ur|mounted every ob&s;tacle that oppo&s;ed his progre&s;s, and a&s;toni&s;hed Europe with the di&s;covery of an unknown <HI>Continent</HI>; while, much about the &s;ame time, Magellan, in&s;pired by a like &s;pirit of enter|pri&s;e, and animated by a magnanimity that de|&s;pi&s;ed danger while in the pur&s;uit of glory, opened a pa&s;&s;age to an Unknown Sea.</P>
<P>By a brief recapitulation of the attempts made to improve the&s;e di&s;coveries, and by &s;hewing what has already been effected, what remained &s;till to be done will be more apparent; and will furni&s;h an idea of the immen&s;ity of the undertaking&mdash;no le&s;s than to &s;ettle the extremes of the two conti|nents,
<PB N="ii" REF="8">
which, though &s;eparated to all human appear|ance, mo&s;t certainly connect the globe.</P>
<P>It was on the 6th of November, in the year 1520, that Magellan entered the Straits, that have ever &s;ince borne his name; and the 27th of the &s;ame month, when, in a tran&s;port of joy, he be|held the wi&s;hed-for object of his pur&s;uit, the GREAT SOUTHERN SEA;&mdash;a pa&s;&s;age &s;o rapid, as has never &s;ince been equalled. Elated with &s;uc|ce&s;s, he proceeded chearfully for &s;everal days, with a favouring gale; but the weather &s;oon changing, and the &s;ea growing boi&s;terous, he al|tered his cour&s;e from the high latitude in which he entered, and directed his views to a more moderate climate. For 113 days he continued &s;teering to the north-we&s;t, without &s;eeing land, or meeting with &s;upplies of any kind, except what water the &s;ailors could &s;ave in the awnings, when the &s;torms of thunder, which were frequent and dreadful, bur&s;t the clouds and unloo&s;ed the rain. Having in that time cro&s;&s;ed the line, he fell in with a range of i&s;lands, in the 12th degree of northern latitude, where with great difficulty he procured &s;ome refre&s;h|ment for tho&s;e of his followers who yet remained alive, mo&s;t of them having peri&s;hed by hunger and fatigue in that long run of lone&s;ome navigation. Tho&s;e who &s;urvived had fed on tough hides, the leather of their &s;hoes, and even on that which &s;ur|rounded the ropes. Add to this, that many of them being attacked by the &s;curvy, the fle&s;h of their gums had &s;o enveloped their teeth, that unable to eat, they died fami&s;hed in all the agonies of horror and de&s;pair. The thievi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition of the tropical i&s;landers in this ocean, to which Magellan now gave the name of PACIFIC, being new to the Spaniards, they were not at fir&s;t appri&s;ed, that while they were abroad enjoying the &s;alutary effects of
<PB N="iii" REF="9">
the refre&s;hing air, the natives were employed in &s;tripping the &s;hips of their iron, and whatever el&s;e they could carry away. It was in vain to puni&s;h the delinquents, for where all were culpable, tho&s;e only could be made to &s;uffer, who were taken in the fact; and &s;uch was their dexterity that few were detected.</P>
<P>From the&s;e i&s;lands, to which Magellan gave the name of Ladrones, he ha&s;tened his departure, and proceeding in &s;earch of the Moluccas, the chief object of his voyage, he found in his way many little i&s;lands, where he was ho&s;pitably received, and where a friendly corre&s;pondence was e&s;tabli&s;hed, by which mutual civilities and mutual good offices were reciprocally interchanged.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands were &s;ituated between the Ladrones, and what are now known by the name of the Phi|lippines, in one of which, named Nathan, Ma|gellan, with 60 men having encountered a whole army, was fir&s;t wounded with a poi&s;oned arrow, and then pierced with a bearded lance. His little &s;quadron, reduced by accumulated di&s;tre&s;s to two &s;hips, with not more than 80 men to navigate them, departed ha&s;tily, and after many di&s;a&s;ters, in which only one, the Victory, e&s;caped, &s;he &s;ingly returned by the Cape of Good Hope, and was the fir&s;t &s;hip that circumnavigated the globe. It may not be improper here to remark, that the death of our late gallant Commander Cook was not un&s;imilar to that of Magellan, both originating from an over confidence in their own con&s;equence, which could avail them nothing when &s;urrounded by exa&s;perated &s;avages, and overpowered by numbers.</P>
<P>Other adventures were not now wanting, to trace the &s;teps of this intrepid Navigator; but they were not all actuated by the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion for glory.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="10">Alvarez de Mendano, indeed, who in 1567, was &s;ent from Lima on di&s;covery, &s;ailed 800 leagues we&s;tward from the coa&s;t of Peru, and fell in with certain i&s;lands in 11 degrees &s;outh, inhabited by people of a yellowi&s;h colour, who&s;e weapons were bows and arrows and darts, and who&s;e bodies were naked, but &s;trangely punctuated. Here the Spa|niards, be&s;ides &s;wine, found little dogs, and &s;ome dome&s;tic fowls like tho&s;e in Europe; and here likewi&s;e they found cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and &s;ome gold; but it has yet been a que&s;tion undecided, to what groupe of i&s;lands this di&s;covery is to be referred, from whence the Spaniards,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>not &s;eeking gold,</HI> brought home 40,000 pezoes."</Q>
Captain Cook inclines to think, that they were the clu&s;ter which comprizes what has &s;ince been known by the name of New Britain.</P>
<P>Mendano afterwards di&s;covered the Archipelago of i&s;lands, called the I&s;lands of Solomon, of which great and &s;mall he counted thirty-three. He al&s;o in 1575 di&s;covered the i&s;land of St. Chri&s;toval, not far from the above Archipelago, in 7 deg. &s;outh, but having no &s;ettled plan to direct his pur&s;uit, it is no wonder that he &s;hould leave his di&s;coveries imperfect; and that, as they produced no imme|diate profit, they &s;hould long remain unnoticed by le&s;s curious adventurers. It was in tho&s;e early times, con&s;idered as &s;ound policy, to throw a veil of &s;ecrecy over new di&s;coveries: it is to the honour of the pre&s;ent times, that the contrary practice al|mo&s;t univer&s;ally prevails.</P>
<P>Sir Francis Drake in 1577, was the fir&s;t Engli&s;h|man that pa&s;&s;ed the Straits already noticed, and though his views were not the mo&s;t honourable, nor founded upon principles that could be &s;trictly ju&s;tified, yet his di&s;coveries were no le&s;s important than if patroni&s;ed by his &s;overeign, and the expence
<PB N="v" REF="11">
defrayed by the legi&s;lature. He di&s;covered the coa&s;t of California, which he judged to be an i&s;land, and named it New Albion; and having &s;ailed to the 43d deg. of northern latitude, with a de&s;ign to return by a north-ea&s;t cour&s;e, was &s;topt in his progre&s;s by the piercing cold. Some &s;mall i&s;lands he di&s;covered in his route; but as his &s;ole view was to return with his booty, he paid no re|gard to objects of le&s;s concern. He arrived in England by the Cape of Good Hope, in 1580.</P>
<P>To him &s;ucceeded Sir Thomas Cavendi&s;h, who likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the Straits of Magellan in 1586, and returned nearly by the &s;ame tract, touching at the Landrones, and making &s;ome &s;tay at the Philippine I&s;les, of which, on his return, he gave a full de&s;cription.</P>
<P>In the mean time, namely, in 1595, the Spaniards, intent upon di&s;covery more than plunder, fitted out four &s;hips, and gave the command to Alvaro Mendana de Neyra. This voyage proved unfor|tunate. The de&s;ign was to have compleated the di&s;covery of the Solomon I&s;lands, and to have made a &s;ettlement in one of the mo&s;t plentiful. But mo&s;t of tho&s;e who embarked on this expedition either died of hunger and di&s;ea&s;e, or were &s;hip|wrecked. His di&s;coveries were the Marque&s;es, in lat. 10 &s;outh; Solitary I&s;land, in 10&deg; 40&prime; we&s;t, long. 178&deg;; and la&s;tly, Santa Cruz, on which one of the fleet was afterwards found with all her &s;ails &s;et, and the people rotten. Soon after this mi&s;|carriage, it was re&s;olved by the Spani&s;h court not to &s;ettle tho&s;e i&s;lands, le&s;t the Engli&s;h, and other foreign adventurers who might pa&s;s the Straits, &s;hould in their pa&s;&s;age home by the Ea&s;t-Indies, be relieved by them. This re&s;olution, however, we find &s;oon after revoked in favour of Quiros.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="12">In 1598, Oliver Van Noort pa&s;&s;ed the Straits; but his profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign being plunder, he made no di&s;coveries. He touched, to refre&s;h, at one of the Ladrone i&s;lands, in his way to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and afterwards refitted his &s;hips at the Philippines. It may here be nece&s;&s;ary to note, that in this year the Sebaldine i&s;lands, as they were formerly called, were di&s;covered by Sebald de Weert, the &s;ame now known by the name of Falkland's I&s;les.</P>
<P>In 1605, Pedro Fernando de Quiros, conceived the de&s;ign of di&s;covering a &s;outhern continent. He is &s;uppo&s;ed, by Mr. Dalrymple and others, to have been the fir&s;t man into who&s;e mind the ex|i&s;tence of &s;uch a continent had ever entered. He &s;ailed from Calloa December 21&s;t, with two &s;hips and a tender. Luis Paz de Torres was entru&s;ted with the command, and Quiros, from zeal for the &s;ucce&s;s of the undertaking, was contented to act in the inferior &s;tation of pilot. On the 26th of January following, they came in &s;ight of a &s;mall flat i&s;land, about four leagues in circumference, with &s;ome trees, but to all appearance uninhabited. It was ju&s;t 1000 leagues from Calloa, and &s;aid to lie in the 25th deg. of S. latitude. Finding it inac|ce&s;&s;ible, they pur&s;ued their voyage, and in two days fell in with another i&s;land, which Capt. Cook &s;uppo&s;es the &s;ame di&s;covered by Capt. Car|teret, and by him called Pitcairn's I&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 4th of February they di&s;covered an i&s;land, thirty leagues in circumference, that pro|mi&s;ed fair to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities, which now began to be very pre&s;&s;ing: but this, like the for|mer, could not be approached. This i&s;land, &s;itu|ated in lat. 28 S. &s;eemed to determine their cour&s;e to the &s;outh; for on the 9th of February, we find them in the 18th deg. &s;outh, and on the 12th in the 17th deg. in conference with the inhabitants
<PB N="vii" REF="13">
of a friendly i&s;land, from whom, with difficulty, they procured &s;ome refre&s;hment, and on the 14th continued their cour&s;e. On the 21&s;t they di&s;co|vered an i&s;land, where they found plenty of fi&s;h, but no water. It was uninhabited, and the birds &s;o tame that they caught them with their hands. They named this i&s;land St. Bernardo, and is pro|bably the &s;ame which Capt. Carteret calls the I&s;land of Danger, in lat. 10&deg; 30&prime; S.</P>
<P>The next i&s;land di&s;covered, they called I&s;la de la Gente Hermo&s;a, or the I&s;le of hand&s;ome peo|ple. From thence they &s;teered for Santa Cruz, already di&s;covered, where they were kindly re|ceived; but did not leave it without murdering &s;ome of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>From this i&s;land they &s;teered their cour&s;e we&s;t|ward, pa&s;&s;ing &s;warms of little i&s;lands, till they ar|rived, on the 7th of April, at a lofty i&s;land, which, by its high and black appearance, they judged to be a Volcano. Here they found a friendly reception, and in return carried off four of their natives, three of whom afterwards made their e&s;cape by watching their opportunity, and jumping into the &s;ea, the fourth accompanied them to New Spain. This i&s;land the Indians called Taumaco. Another i&s;land in 12 deg. S. na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">d Tucopia, they pa&s;&s;ed, after &s;ome friendly inter|cour&s;e with the inhabitants; and on the 25th of April, came in &s;ight of an i&s;land which they named No&s;tra Signora de la Luz, in 14 deg. S. and pre|&s;ently after ob&s;erved four others i&s;lands, one of which pre&s;ented a mo&s;t picture&s;que appearance, diver&s;ified with every beauty which Nature could di&s;play; rivers, pools of water, ca&s;cades, and foun|tains to decorate and dignify the pro&s;pect. Here the inhabitants were frank, as their country was abundant; but here the Spaniards could not help
<PB N="viii" REF="14">
di&s;covering their natural jealou&s;y. The fir&s;t who approached their boat, was a youth of graceful &s;tature; him they thought to have &s;ecured by &s;lily throwing a chain about his leg; but this the Indian &s;napt, and in&s;tantly made his e&s;cape by jumping over-board; the next who came on board, they placed in the &s;tocks by &s;tratagem, le&s;t he too &s;hould make his e&s;cape in the &s;ame manner. Could it be wondered, therefore, that the friends of the&s;e impri&s;oned youths &s;hould endeavour, by fair appearances, to en&s;nare their enemies, and &s;eek revenge. Making &s;igns of peace, the Spa|niards no &s;ooner came within their reach, than they let fly a volley of poi&s;oned arrows, by which &s;e|veral of the crew were wounded. Interpreting this as an act of treachery, without attending to the cau&s;e that had produced it, they quitted the i&s;land in the night, and directing their cour&s;e to the South-We&s;t, came in &s;ight of an immen&s;e country, which had every appearance of the con|tinent of which they were in &s;earch. They per|ceived an open bay, and on the beach, men of a gigantic &s;tature. To this land they made their ap|proaches with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, imagining that they had accompli&s;hed their wi&s;hes, and that their labours would &s;oon be rewarded with honour to them&s;elves, and advantage to their country.</P>
<P>On the 3d of May, they entered the harbour, having the day before given the name of St. PHI|LIP and St. JAMES to the <HI>bay,</HI> with the fair ap|pearance of which, they had been &s;o highly de|lighted. To the <HI>port</HI> they gave the name of LA VERA CRUZ, and to the <HI>country</HI> AUSTRAL DEL ESPERITO SANTO. The harbour, &s;ituated between two rivers, to which they gave the names of Jur|dan and Salvador, was equally convenient and beautiful; the margin of the &s;hores was mo&s;t ro|mantically
<PB N="ix" REF="15">
inter&s;per&s;ed with flowers and plants odoriferous and &s;plendid; nor was the country le&s;s fruitful than it was plea&s;ant. It abounded in all tho&s;e delicious fruits which render the countries between the Tropics the happie&s;t in the world; and there were be&s;ides great plenty of &s;wine, dogs, fowls and birds of various kinds and colours. The inhabitants, indeed, were jealous of their ap|proach, and di&s;covered great unea&s;ine&s;s at their attempting to land. The Spaniards, however, rather chu&s;ing to intimidate than conciliate the na|tives, made an excur&s;ion into the country, &s;ur|prized the un&s;u&s;pecting people of a little village, and brought off a &s;upply of hogs; but not with|out imminent danger to the party employed on that &s;ervice, who were pur&s;ued to the water's edge, and &s;ome of them wounded.</P>
<P>As Nature had dealt her bounty with a liberal hand to the inhabitants of this happy country, &s;he had enriched her coa&s;ts with fi&s;h as well as the land with fruits. In pur&s;uit of the former, the Spaniards met with no interruption, but their &s;uc|ce&s;s, which was very great, was near proving fatal to them. They caught large quantities of a mo&s;t beautiful fi&s;h, which, though of a delicate flavour, was of &s;o poi&s;onous a quality, that whoever eat of it was &s;uddenly &s;eized with &s;ickne&s;s and pain, for which there appeared no remedy. Every &s;oldier and every &s;ailor was grievou&s;ly affected: the whole &s;hips companies were rendered incapable of their duty, and officers and people were alike alarmed with the apprehen&s;ions of approaching death, till by degrees, the violence of the di&s;order began to abate, and in &s;ix days all were re&s;tored. It is worthy of note, that &s;ome of the crew of the Re|&s;olution, in Capt. Cook's former voyage, who had eaten of a fi&s;h caught in tho&s;e &s;eas, were &s;eized
<PB N="x" REF="16">
in the &s;ame manner, and that the &s;wine and dogs, that had eaten the entrails and the bones, actually died.</P>
<P>Quiros, for what rea&s;on does not appear, very &s;oon quitted this <HI>promi&s;ed land,</HI> and the two &s;hips &s;eparated as &s;oon as they had cleared the bay; Quiros, with the Capitana, his own &s;hip, &s;haped his cour&s;e to the N. E. and after &s;uffering the greate&s;t hard&s;hips, returned to New Spain; while de Torres, in the Almiranta and the Tender, &s;teered to the We&s;t, and was, as Captain Cook ob&s;erves, the fir&s;t that &s;ailed between New Holland and New Guinea.</P>
<P>Quiros, &s;oon after his return, pre&s;ented a Me|morial to Philip II. of Spain, in which he enu|merates twenty-three i&s;lands that he had di&s;co|vered; and among them three parts of the coun|try called Au&s;tralia del E&s;piritu Santo, in which land were found the Bay of St. Philip and St. Jago, and part of Vera Cruz, where he remained with his &s;hips thirty-&s;ix days.</P>
<P>In this Memorial, Quiros &s;uppo&s;es the above three parts to be one great country; and to &s;trengthen his conjecture, relates the declaration of Pedro, the Indian, whom they &s;eized at Tan|maco, and carried to New Spain. There Pedro declared, in the pre&s;ence of the Marquis of Mon|te&s;claros, that he was a native of the I&s;land Chi|cayana, larger than that of Taumaco, where he was found; that from one to the other is four days &s;ail of their ve&s;&s;els; that Chicayana is low land, very abundant in fruit; that the natives of it are of his good Indian colour, with long lank hair, and punctuate, as he was, a little in the face, arms, and brea&s;t; and that there were al&s;o white people in it, who have their hair red and very long;

with mulattoes, who&s;e hair is not curled, nor quite &s;trait.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"He further &s;aid, that from the i&s;land of Tau|maco, at three days &s;ail, and at two from Chicay|ana, there is another i&s;land, larger than the two above-mentioned, which is called Guaytopo; and that all the three i&s;lands are friends, and of one language: that he was at Taumaco, when a &s;hip arrived there with only &s;even men, who were very white, except one who was brown, and three wo|men, white and beautiful as Spani&s;h, who had their hair red and very long; and that all three came covered from head to foot with a kind of veil, blue or black, and very fine, to which they gave the name of Foa-foa; and that the&s;e ten per|&s;ons were all who remained alive of forty, the re&s;t having died of hunger and thir&s;t, He al&s;o had &s;een come to his I&s;land Chicayana, another &s;hip of two hulls full of people, white and beautiful, and with many very hand&s;ome girls; and counting on his fingers by ten and ten, he intimated they were in all 110 per&s;ons.</P>
<P>"He farther &s;aid, that from another i&s;land called Tucopia, at the di&s;tance of five days of their &s;ailing, is that great country, inhabited by many people, dun-coloured and mulattoes, in large towns; that they were friendly, and did not eat human fle&s;h; nor could their languages be un|der&s;tood: that it was a country of very high moun|tains and large rivers; and that to go from the i&s;land of Tucopia, to that country when the &s;un ri&s;es, they keep it on the left hand, which mu&s;t be from &s;outh towards &s;outh-ea&s;t."</P></Q></P>
<P>From the evidence of this man, and what him|&s;elf &s;aw, Quiros concludes, that there were only two large portions of the earth &s;evered from Eu|rope, Africa, and A&s;ia. The fir&s;t is America,
<PB N="xii" REF="18">
which CHRISTOPHER COLON (Columbus) di&s;co|vered; the &s;econd and la&s;t is that which he had &s;een, and &s;olicited to people, and completely to di&s;cover to the King.</P>
<P>Upon the authority of this Memorial, and others to the like purport, pre&s;ented by Quiros to Phi|lip III. of Spain, future geographers grounded their opinion of the reality of a Southern Continent, to the di&s;covery of which that vain Navigator boldly a&s;&s;erted an undoubted claim.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The magnitude of the countries newly di&s;covered,"</Q>
&s;ays he to his Sovereign,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"by what I &s;aw, is as much as that of all Europe, A&s;ia Minor, the Ca&s;pian Sea, and Per&s;ia, with all the Mediterranean included."</Q>
That an a&s;&s;ertion like this &s;hould gain credit, at a time when nearly one quarter of the globe lay undi&s;covered, is not to be wondered; but that a man could be found, upon &s;uch &s;lender ground as the di&s;covery of a few in&s;ignificant i&s;lands, lying, as it has lately appeared, within the narrow limits of 8 or 10 degrees of latitude, and le&s;s of longitude; to impo&s;e upon an enlightened Prince, and engage the attention of men of &s;cience in every country throughout the globe, is matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, which, like other my&s;teries when they come to be di&s;clo&s;ed, &s;urpri&s;e only by their in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>But there are &s;ome who pretend, in ju&s;tification of Quiros, that in his return to Spain, he had &s;een that va&s;t portion of land which Ta&s;man af|terwards di&s;covered, and which is now known by the name of New Holland; and Capt. Cook ad|mits, that one of the i&s;lands which Quiros touched at might be New Britain: this conjecture does not &s;eem de&s;titute of probability. Be this as it may, to the object which Quiros had pointed, whether real or imaginary, every maritime power ca&s;t a jealous eye. No &s;ooner was France appri&s;ed of
<PB N="xiii" REF="19">
the intentions of the Briti&s;h Court, to engage in earne&s;t in the bu&s;ine&s;s of this di&s;covery, than &s;he &s;ent a Navigator of her own to pur&s;ue the &s;ame track, who was &s;oon after followed by another on the part of Spain. As the &s;ucce&s;s which attended the&s;e fir&s;t enterpri&s;es by no means an&s;wered the expectations of tho&s;e by whom they were &s;et on foot, the two latter courts, who had profit only for their object, relinqui&s;hed the project when they found them&s;elves engaged in a hopele&s;s pur|&s;uit. The per&s;everance of our amiable Sovereign, in the pro&s;ecution of his liberal de&s;igns, as it has enlightened, &s;o it has in&s;pired every lover of &s;ci|ence at home and abroad, with a reverential regard for his princely virtues, in promoting and patro|ni&s;ing u&s;eful arts. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In 1614, George Spitzbergen, with a &s;trong &s;quadron of Dutch &s;hips, pa&s;&s;ed the Straits of Magellan, and after cruizing for &s;ome time with various &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the Spaniards, &s;et &s;ail from Port Nativity on the coa&s;t of Peru, on his return home. In his pa&s;&s;age, in 19 deg. of north lat. and about 30 long. from the continent, he di&s;co|vered a mighty rock, and three days after, a new i&s;land with five hills, neither of which have &s;ince been &s;een. The fir&s;t land he made was the La|drones, already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In 1615, <HI>Schouten</HI> and <HI>Le Maire,</HI> in the Unity of 360 tons, and the Hoorn of 110, &s;ailed from the Texel on the 14th of June, profe&s;&s;edly for the di&s;covery of a new pa&s;&s;age to the South Seas. The &s;ubjects of the States of Holland being prohi|bited, by an exclu&s;ive charter granted to their Ea&s;t-India Company, from trading either to the ea&s;tward by the Cape of Good Hope, or to the we&s;tward by the Magellanic Straits, &s;ome pri|vate merchants, con&s;idering this prohibition as an
<PB N="xiv" REF="20">
encroachment on their liberty, determined, if po&s;|&s;ible, to defeat the purpo&s;e of the charter, and to trade to the &s;outhern countries by a track never before attempted. With this view they fitted out the &s;hips already mentioned, one of which, the Hoorn, was burnt in careening, at King's I&s;land on the coa&s;t of Brazil, and the other left fingly to pur&s;ue her voyage. Having &s;aved what &s;tores they could re&s;cue from the flames, they proceeded on their voyage, directing their cour&s;e to the &s;outh-we&s;t, till in lat. 54&deg; 46&prime;, they came in &s;ight of an opening, to which (having happily pa&s;&s;ed it) they gave the name of <HI>Strait le Maire,</HI> in compliment to the principal projector of the voyage, though that honour was certainly due to Schouten, who had the direction of the voyage. Having &s;oon after weathered the &s;outhernmo&s;t point of the American continent, they called that promontory Cape Horne, or more properly Hoorn, after the town in Holland, where the enterprize was fir&s;t &s;ecretly concerted; and two i&s;lands which they had pa&s;&s;ed, they named Barnevelt I&s;les. They had no &s;ooner cleared the land, than they changed their cour&s;e to the northward, with a view to make &s;ome &s;tay at Juan Fernandes to refit; but finding both that and the i&s;land of Ma&s;&s;afuera inacce&s;&s;i|ble, by rea&s;on of the great &s;well, they were obliged to continue their voyage till a more favourable opportunity &s;hould offer to refre&s;h the crew. The fir&s;t land they made, was a &s;mall low i&s;land in lat. 15&deg; 15&prime;, long. 136&deg; 30&prime; W. which afforded them no refre&s;hment, except a &s;canty portion of &s;curvy|gra&s;s, but no water. They named this Dog I&s;land, from a &s;ingular circum&s;tance of finding in it dumb dogs, that could neither bark nor &s;narl. About &s;even degrees further we&s;t, they fell in with ano|ther i&s;land, which they called <HI>Sondre Ground,</HI> be|cau&s;e
<PB N="xv" REF="21">
they &s;ounded, but found no bottom. Still continuing their cour&s;e to the we&s;tward, they came to an i&s;land, to which they gave the name of <HI>Wa|terland,</HI> as it afforded them a fre&s;h &s;upply of wa|ter, of which they &s;tood in much need. They likewi&s;e procured plenty of fre&s;h herbs; but not being able to come to an anchor, they kept their cour&s;e, and &s;oon came in &s;ight of a fourth i&s;land, in which they could perceive a &s;tream of water, but, like the other i&s;lands which they had pa&s;&s;ed, it &s;eemed difficult of acce&s;s. They hoi&s;ted out their boat, and filled it with empty ca&s;ks; but in|&s;tead of water, their people returned covered with in&s;ects, which, though not &s;o large as mu&s;ketoes, were, by their numbers and their venom, more trouble&s;ome. Such &s;warms came from the &s;hore as covered the &s;hip as with a ca&s;e, and it was more than three days before the crew could free them|&s;elves and the ve&s;&s;el from the&s;e tormentors. This they named <HI>Fly I&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>In their cour&s;e from this i&s;land an incident hap|pened that is a reproach to humanity; an Indian bark fell in their way, to which, in&s;tead of mak|ing &s;ignals of peace to conciliate the crew, they fired a gun to bring them to. The bark was full of people, male and female, who, frighted at the report, in&s;tead of gue&s;&s;ing the intent, ha&s;tened to make their e&s;cape. Pre&s;ently the pinnace was hoi&s;ted out, manned, and a pur&s;uit commenced; the unhappy Indians, finding it in vain to contend, &s;everal being wounded by being fire at in their flight, rather cho&s;e to peri&s;h in the ocean, than tru&s;t to the mercy of their pur&s;uers. Mo&s;t of the men, ju&s;t as the Dutchmen were about to board their ve&s;&s;el, jumped into the &s;ea, and with them they took their provi&s;ions; tho&s;e who remained, chiefly women and children, and &s;uch as were
<PB N="xvi" REF="22">
wounded, &s;ubmitted, and were kindly u&s;ed, had their wounds dre&s;&s;ed, and re&s;tored to their bark; but &s;urely nothing could excu&s;e the brutal pro|ceedings at the fir&s;t on&s;et, nor compen&s;ate for the lives of the innocent &s;ufferers.</P>
<P><HI>Cocos</HI> and <HI>Traitors I&s;lands</HI> were the next they fell in with in their run from Fly I&s;land. The&s;e were adjoining i&s;lands, and &s;eemed to be compo&s;ed of one people, and by joining cordially together to revenge the death of their unfortunate friends, they appear to have been of one mind. The Voyagers now began to feel di&s;tre&s;s, and to repent of their ra&s;h adventure; they held a con&s;ultation in what manner to proceed, being in want of almo&s;t every nece&s;&s;ary. Fortune, however, did more in their favour than their own prowe&s;s; for after hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;land of <HI>Hope,</HI> (&s;o called to expre&s;s their feelings) where they were very roughly re|ceived by the inhabitants, they arrived at a mo&s;t delightful i&s;land, abounding with every ble&s;&s;ing that nature could be&s;tow; and inhabited by a peo|ple who &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of their own happy &s;tate, and ready to &s;hare it with tho&s;e who were in want of the good things which they them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The&s;e they generou&s;ly be&s;towed even to profu&s;ion. Here the Voyagers refitted their &s;hips, recovered their &s;ick, recruited their almo&s;t exhau&s;ted &s;tock of provi&s;ions, by a plentiful &s;upply of hogs, and with as large quantities of the delicious fruits with which the i&s;land was &s;tored, as they could con|veniently carry away. This proving a &s;econd home to them, they gave it the name of <HI>Hoorn I&s;land,</HI> for the rea&s;on already a&s;&s;igned. It is &s;ituate in lat. 14&deg; 56&prime; long. 179&deg; 30&prime; ea&s;t, and in every re&s;pect re&s;embles the i&s;land of Otaheite, except in its naval &s;trength, in which there is no com|petition.</P>
<P><PB N="xvii" REF="23">Being now plentifully &s;upplied, and the crew in high health, and having no hope of di&s;covering the Continent of which they came in &s;earch, they determined to return home by the neare&s;t track: accordingly they altered their cour&s;e to the north|we&s;t, till they approached the line, and pa&s;&s;ing many i&s;lands, to which they gave names, as ap|pearances or circum&s;tances pre&s;ented, as Green I&s;land, St. John's I&s;land, &amp;c. they coa&s;ted the north &s;ide of New Britain, and arrived at Bantam, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, where their &s;hip was &s;eized, and their cargo confi&s;cated, at the in&s;tance of the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company, under pretence of being engaged in contraband trade. It is remark|able, that hitherto they had only lo&s;t four men, one of whom died on their landing.</P>
<P>In 1623, Prince Maurice and the States of Holland, fitted out a fleet to di&s;tre&s;s the Spaniards in the South Seas, and gave the command to Jaques Hermite: but as the&s;e returned by a direct cour&s;e from Lima to the Ladrones, without mak|ing any di&s;coveries in what is called the Pacific Sea, it would be foreign to the de&s;ign of this In|troduction, to detain the reader by an unnece&s;&s;ary digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In 1642, Abel Ta&s;man &s;ailed from Batavia in the Heem&s;kirk, accompanied by the Zee Haan pink, with a profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of di&s;covering the &s;outhern continent. He directed his cour&s;e to the Mauritius, and from thence, &s;teering to the &s;outhward, the fir&s;t land he made was the ea&s;tern point of New Holland, &s;ince known by the name of Van Dieman's Land, in lat. 42&deg; 25&prime; long. 163&deg; 50&prime; E. In this high latitude he proceeded to the ea&s;tward, till he fell in with the we&s;ternmo&s;t coa&s;t of New Zealand, where the greate&s;t part of the boat's crew of the Zee Haan were murdered by
<PB N="xviii" REF="24">
the &s;avages in a bay, to which he gave the name of <HI>Murderer's Bay,</HI> now better known by that of Charlotte's Sound, &s;o called by our late Naviga|tors. From Murderer's Bay, he &s;teered W. N. W. till he arrived at Three Kings I&s;land, between which and the main land he pa&s;&s;ed, and run to the ea&s;tward, as far as the 220th degree of ea&s;t longitude; then turning to the northward, till he came into the 17th degree of &s;outhern latitude, he veered again to the we&s;tward, with a de&s;ign to reach Hoorn I&s;land, di&s;covered by Schouten, in order to refit his &s;hip, and refre&s;h his men. But in his pa&s;&s;age he fell in with the i&s;les of Pyl&s;taert, Am&s;terdam, Middleburg, and Rotterdam, at the latter of which i&s;lands he found every accommo|dation which he expected to meet with at Hoorn I&s;land, and embraced the opportunity that then pre&s;ented of &s;upplying his wants. This nece&s;&s;ary end accompli&s;hed, he relinqui&s;hed his de&s;ign of vi&s;iting Traitor's and Hoorn I&s;lands, and directing his cour&s;e to the N. W. di&s;covered 18 or 20 &s;mall i&s;lands, in lat 17&deg; 19&prime;, and long. 201&deg; 35&prime; to which he gave the name of Prince William's I&s;lands, and Hem&s;kirk's Banks. From thence he pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to New Guinea, without either di&s;covering the continent he &s;ought, or vi&s;iting the Solomon I&s;les, which at that time were judged the key to the grand di&s;covery. Thus leaving the whole in the &s;ame &s;tate of uncertainty as before, Ta&s;man returned to Batavia on the 15th of June 1643.</P>
<P>In 1681, Dampier pa&s;&s;ed the Magellanic Straits; but in his return &s;ailed 5975 miles, in lat. 13&deg; N. without &s;eeing fi&s;h, fowl, or any living creature but what they had on board.</P>
<P>Next to him &s;ucceeded, in 1683, Capt. Cow|ley, who &s;ailed from Virginia to the South Sea, but made no di&s;coveries after he left the we&s;tern
<PB N="xix" REF="25">
coa&s;ts of America; returning by the old track to the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>In 1699, Dampier made a voyage profe&s;&s;edly on di&s;covery, which was chiefly confined to New Holland, New Guinea, New Britain, to which he gave name, and the i&s;lands adjacent. His di&s;co|veries were of infinite importance, but as New Hol|land was the chief object of enquiry, they do not properly come within the limits of our review.</P>
<P>In 1703, Dampier made a third voyage to the South Seas, but without making any new di&s;co|veries. He was accompanied in this voyage by Mr. Funnel, to whom the circumnavigation of the globe is a&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In 1708, the Duke and Duche&s;s &s;ailed from Bri&s;tol to the South Seas; but returned, as all the Freebooters did, by the common track.</P>
<P>In 1719, Capt. Clipperton pa&s;&s;ed the Straits, with a view to enrich his owners by the &s;poils of the Spaniards. He returned likewi&s;e through the Ladrone I&s;lands, con&s;equently could make no di&s;|coveries in the Pacific Seas.</P>
<P>In 1721, the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company, at the in&s;tance of Capt. Roggewein, fitted out a re|&s;pectable fleet for the di&s;eovery of that continent, which lay hitherto undi&s;covered, though univer|&s;ally believed to exi&s;t. Three &s;tout &s;hips were ap|pointed, and well provided with every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary for this &s;ervice; the Eagle of 36 guns and 111 men, on board of which embarked Rogge|wein as Commodore, having under him Capt. Co&s;ter, an experienced navigator; the Tienhoven of 28 guns and 100 men, of which Capt. Bowman was commander; and the African Galley, com|manded by Capt. Ro&s;enthall. From this voyage every thing was hoped. The equipment of the &s;hips, the appointment of the commanders, and,
<PB N="xx" REF="26">
above all, the hereditary zeal of the Commodore, which he inherited from his father for the &s;ervice; all contributed to rai&s;e the expectations of Europe to the highe&s;t pitch. Before they arrived at the Straits of Magellan, they had encountered the mo&s;t boi&s;terous &s;eas, and endured the mo&s;t into|lerable hard&s;hips that ever &s;hips re&s;i&s;ted. They had no &s;ooner entered the Straits, than they were again attacked by tempe&s;tuous weather. This &s;torm was &s;carce abated, when they were alarmed by the &s;ight of a ve&s;&s;el, which they took either for a pirate or a Spani&s;h &s;hip of war, and as &s;he &s;eemed to approach very fa&s;t, they were preparing for an engagement, when, to their agreeable &s;urprize, they di&s;covered it to be the Tienhoven's &s;hallop, on board of which was Capt. Bowman, who had been &s;eparated three months before, and it was concluded had been engulphed in the hurricane that happened when the Tienhoven lo&s;t her main-top and mizen-ma&s;ts, and the Eagle her main&s;ail-yard. They mutually rejoiced at each other's e&s;|cape. Capt. Bowman thought his a&s;&s;ociates had peri&s;hed in the &s;torm, and they had given him over for lo&s;t. But their joy was of &s;hort continuance; they had other dangers to encounter, and other hard&s;hips to undergo; they found the Magellanic Straits impracticable, and entered the Southern Ocean with difficulty, by Strait le Maire. After recruiting their water at the I&s;les of Fernandez, their fir&s;t attempt was in &s;earch of Davis's Land; which, it was imagined, from the de&s;cription given by the di&s;coverer, would prove an Index to the continent of which they were in &s;earch. They mi&s;&s;ed it where they expected to find it, but ac|cident threw it in their way. It proved a &s;mall i&s;land which they thought a new di&s;covery, and be|cau&s;e they fell in with it on Ea&s;ter-day, they called
<PB N="xxi" REF="27">
it <HI>Pa&s;ch,</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;ter-I&s;land.</HI> We have ju&s;t to remark of this i&s;land, that as it was then full of people, and but few &s;een when la&s;t explored, and among them only FIFTEEN women, it is more than pro|bable that in le&s;s than another century, this remote and barren i&s;land will be wholly depopulated. From this i&s;land Roggewein pur&s;ued nearly the &s;ame track with that which Schouten had pointed out, till veering more to the north, he fell in with the i&s;lands at which Commodore Byron fir&s;t landed, and where &s;ome of the wreck of the African Gal|ley was actually found. Here five of the crew de&s;erted, and were left behind; and it would have been an object of curious enquiry for the Natura|li&s;ts who accompanied the Commodore in his voyage, to have endeavoured to trace a &s;imilitude of European features among the inhabitants of George's I&s;land, as there is rea&s;on to believe <HI>that</HI> to be the i&s;land on which the five Dutchmen cho&s;e to fix their re&s;idence. This i&s;land, which they place in the 15th degree of &s;outhern latitude, they named Mi&s;chievous I&s;land, owing to their late di&s;a&s;ter, of which a particular account is given in the third volume of this collection.</P>
<P>Eight leagues to the we&s;t of this i&s;land, they di&s;covered another, to which they gave the name of Aurora, from its &s;plendid appearance, gilded by the rays of the ri&s;ing &s;un. Another i&s;land, di&s;|covered in the evening of the &s;ame day, they called <HI>Ve&s;per.</HI> Pur&s;uing their cour&s;e to the we&s;tward, they di&s;covered a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, undoubtedly the &s;ame now called the <HI>Great Cyclades,</HI> to which they gave the name of the Labyrinth, becau&s;e it was with difficulty they could clear them.</P>
<P>In a very few days &s;ail after pa&s;&s;ing the Laby|rinth, they came in &s;ight of a plea&s;ant i&s;land, to which, from its fair appearance, they gave the
<PB N="xxii" REF="28">
name of the <HI>I&s;land of Recreation.</HI> They were at fir&s;t ho&s;pitably received; but in the end the na|tives endeavoured to &s;urprize them by &s;tratagem, and to cut them off. They had &s;upplied the &s;trangers with provi&s;ions, water, and wood, and had a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in collecting greens, and in convey|ing them to the &s;hips; but one day &s;eeing a party of them unarmed, and walking carele&s;ly in the fields, charmed with the delights of the country, in a moment &s;ome thou&s;ands of the natives ru&s;hed &s;uddenly upon them, and with &s;howers of &s;tones, began an a&s;&s;ault. The Dutch, from the &s;hips ob|&s;erving a tumult, and &s;u&s;pecting the wor&s;t, came ha&s;tily to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their comrades, when a general engagement en&s;ued, in which many na|tives were &s;hot dead, &s;ome of the Dutchmen killed, and not a few wounded. This proved baneful to the voyage. Few of the crews of either &s;hip, after this, could be prevailed on to venture on &s;hore for provi&s;ions; mo&s;t of them became di&s;contented, and &s;ome mutinous. It was therefore concluded, at a general council of officers, to continue their cour&s;e towards New Britain and New Guinea; and thence by the way of the Moluccas to the Ea&s;t Indies, which was accordingly carried into execu|tion: and thus ended, like all the former, a voy|age which was expected at lea&s;t to have &s;olved the que&s;tion concerning the exi&s;tence or non-exi&s;tence of a new continent; but in fact it determined no|thing. They who argued from the harmony that is ob&s;ervable in the works of Nature, in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;omething was wanting to give one &s;ide of the globe an equipoi&s;e to the other; while tho&s;e who rea&s;oned from experience, pronounced this ideal &s;y&s;tem the mere creature of fanciful &s;peculation.</P>
<P>In 1738, Lozier Bouvet was &s;ent by the French Ea&s;t-India Company, upon di&s;covery in the South
<PB N="xxiii" REF="29">
Atlantic Ocean. He &s;ailed from Port L'Orient on the 19th of July, on board the Eagle, accom|panied by the Mary, and on the 1&s;t of January following, he di&s;covered, or thought he di&s;covered, land in lat. 54&deg; S. Long. from Paris 11&prime; Ea&s;t. But this land being diligently &s;ought for by Capt. Cook, in his voyage for the di&s;covery of the Southern Continent in 1777, without effect, there is rea&s;on to doubt if any &s;uch land exi&s;ts; or, if it does, it is too remote from any known track to be of u&s;e to trade or navigation.</P>
<P>This di&s;covery has, however, been much in|&s;i&s;ted on by M. Le Mercier, in a paper publi&s;hed by that celebrated Geographer in the Memoirs of the French Academy for 1776, which has given ri&s;e to a very able defence of Capt. Cook's Journal, by Mr. Wales, who accompanied Capt. Cook in his re&s;earch for the land in que&s;tion; but as the di&s;covery it&s;elf can be no manner of u&s;e either to geography or navigation, we &s;hall pa&s;s it over, with only noticing that the ob&s;ervations made by Mr. Wales, independent of the di&s;covery, are &s;uch as every navigator &s;hould be ma&s;ter of. This de|fence is printed in the introduction to Capt. Cook's Journal, now publi&s;hed by authority, and is well worth pre&s;erving. But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Bouvet pur&s;ued his cour&s;e to the ea&s;tward, in a high latitude, about 29&deg; of longitude farther, when in lat. 51&deg; &s;outh, the two &s;hips parted, one going to the i&s;land of Mauritius, the other return|ing to France.</P>
<P>In 1742, Commodore An&s;on traver&s;ed the Great Pacific Ocean; but his bu&s;ine&s;s being war, he made no di&s;coveries within the limits of our re|view; and his &s;tory is too well known to need re|capitulation.</P>
<P><PB N="xxiv" REF="30">Come we now to the aera when his Maje&s;ty formed the de&s;ign of making di&s;coveries, and ex|ploring the Southern Hemi&s;phere; and when, in the year 1764, he directed it to be carried into execution.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"Accordingly Commodore Byron having un|der his command the Dolphin and Tamar, &s;ailed from the Downs on the 21&s;t of June the &s;ame year, and having vi&s;ited the Falkland I&s;lands, pa&s;&s;ed through the Straits of Magellan into the Pacific Ocean, where he di&s;covered the I&s;lands of Diappointment, George's, Prince of Wales's, the I&s;les of Danger, York and Byron's I&s;lands. He returned to England the 9th of May 1766.</P>
<P>"And in the month of Augu&s;t following, the Dolphin was again &s;ent out under the command of Capt. Wallis, with the Swallow, commanded by Capt. Carteret.</P>
<P>"They proceeded together, till they came to the we&s;t end of the Straits of Magellan, and in &s;ight of the Great South Sea, where they were &s;e|parated.</P>
<P>"Capt. Wallis directed his cour&s;e more we&s;|terly than any Navigator had done before him in &s;o high a latitude, but met with no land till he got within the Tropic, where he di&s;covered the i&s;lands Whit&s;unday, Queen Charlotte, Egmont, Duke of Glouce&s;ter, Duke of Cumberland, Mai|tea, Otaheite, Eimeo, Tapamanou, Howe, Scilly, Bo&s;cawen, Keppel, and Wallis; and returned to England May 1768.</P>
<P>"His companion, Capt. Carteret, kept a dif|ferent route, in which he di&s;covered the i&s;lands O&s;naburgh, Glouce&s;ter, Queen Charlotte's I&s;les, Carteret's, Gower's, and the Strait between New Britain and New Ireland, which, though undoubt|edly
<PB N="xxv" REF="31">
di&s;covered by Dampier before, has been ce|lebrated as a new di&s;covery of va&s;t importance to navigation. He returned to England in 1769.</P>
<P>[We are told, in the introduction to the voyage ju&s;t publi&s;hed, that the voyages of the above Navigators <Q REND="inline">"were principally confined to a fa|vourite object of di&s;covery in the South Atlantic Ocean,"</Q> for which we can find no other ground than that of Commodore Byron's return from the Straits of Magellan, in &s;earch of Pepys, now called Falkland's I&s;land.]</P>
<P>"In November 1767, Commodore Bougain|ville &s;ailed from France, in the frigate La Bou|deu&s;e, with the &s;tore-&s;hip l'Etoile. After &s;pend|ing &s;ome time on the coa&s;t of Brazil, and at Falk|land's I&s;lands, he got into the Pacific Sea by the Straits of Magellan, January 1768.</P>
<P>"In this Ocean he di&s;covered the four Facar|dines, the I&s;le of Lanciers, and Harpe I&s;land, (the &s;ame afterwards named by Cook Lagoon I&s;land) Thrum Cap, and Bow I&s;land. About twenty leagues farther to the we&s;t, he di&s;covered four other i&s;lands; afterwards fell in with Maitea, Otaheite, I&s;les of Navigators, and Forlorn Hope, which to him were new di&s;coveries. He then pa&s;&s;ed through between the Hebrides, which he calls the Great Cyclades, fir&s;t di&s;covered by Rogge|wein, di&s;covered the Shoal of Diana, and &s;ome others; the land of Cape Deliverance, &s;everal i&s;lands more to the north; pa&s;&s;ed to the north of New Ireland, (which by the way he could not have done by any other cour&s;e than thro' what is now called the Endeavour's Straits) touched at Batavia, and arrived in France in March 1769.</P>
<P>"In 1769, the Spaniards &s;ent a &s;hip to trace the di&s;coveries of the Engli&s;h and French. This &s;hip touched at Ea&s;ter I&s;land, and arrived at Ota|heite
<PB N="xxvi" REF="32">
in 1771. In her return, &s;he di&s;covered &s;ome i&s;lands, in lat. 32 S. and long. 130 W. but whe|ther &s;he bent her cour&s;e to New or Old Spain, remains undecided.</P>
<P>"In 1769, the French fitted out another &s;hip from the Mauritius, under the command of Capt. Kergulen, who, having di&s;covered &s;ome barren i&s;lands between the Cape of Good Hope and Van Dieman's Land, contented him&s;elf with leaving &s;ome Memorials there, which were found by Capt. Cook in the voyage of which we are now about to give an account.</P>
<P>"This year was rendered remarkable by the Tran&s;it of the Planet Venus over the Sun's Di&s;k, a phaenomenon of great importance to A&s;tronomy, and which every where engaged the attention of the learned in that Science.</P>
<P>"In the beginning of the year 1768, the Royal Society pre&s;ented a Memorial to his Maje&s;ty, &s;et|ting forth the advantages to be derived from ac|curate ob&s;ervations of this Tran&s;it in different parts of the world, particularly from a &s;et of &s;uch ob&s;ervations made in a &s;outhern latitude, between the 140th and 180th degrees of longitude we&s;t from the Royal Ob&s;ervatory at Greenwich; at the &s;ame time repre&s;enting, that ve&s;&s;els, properly equipped, would be nece&s;&s;ary to convey the ob|&s;ervers to their de&s;tined &s;tations; but that the So|ciety were in no condition to defray the expence."</P></Q></P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this Memorial, the Admi|ralty were directed by his Maje&s;ty to provide pro|per ve&s;&s;els for that purpo&s;e; and the Endeavour bark was accordingly purcha&s;ed, fitted out, and the command given to Capt. Cook, who had al|ready &s;ignalized him&s;elf as an experienced Navi|gator; and Mr. Charles Green the A&s;tronomer
<PB N="xxvii" REF="33">
was, jointly with the Captain, appointed to make the ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>Otaheite being the i&s;land preferred for the per|formance of that important &s;ervice, Capt. Cook received orders to proceed directly; and his in|&s;tructions were, as &s;oon as the a&s;tronomical ob&s;er|vations were completed, to pro&s;ecute the de&s;ign of making di&s;coveries in the South Pacific Ocean, as far as the 40th degree of &s;outh latitude; and then, if no land &s;hould be di&s;covered, to &s;hape his cour&s;e between lat. 40 and 35, till he &s;hould fall in with New Zealand, which he was to ex|plore; and thence to return.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of the&s;e in&s;tructions he &s;ailed from Plymouth on the 26th of Augu&s;t, 1768, and on the 13th of April following, arrived at Ota|heite, having in his way di&s;covered Lagoon I&s;land, Two Groups, Bird I&s;land, and Chain I&s;land.</P>
<P>At Otaheite he remained three months, and, (be&s;ides the A&s;tronomer Mr. Green) being accom|panied by Mr. Banks, a gentleman of fortune, and Dr. Solander, one of the Librarians of the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, eminent both for his knowledge in Natural Hi&s;tory, and in Botany; we have only to remark, that all Europe has already been bene|fited by the employment of their time.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations on the Tran&s;it being com|pleated with the wi&s;ht for &s;ucce&s;s, Capt. Cook proceeded on di&s;covery; he vi&s;ited the Society-I&s;les, and di&s;covered Oheteroa, fell in with the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of New Zealand, and examined it; thence proceeding to New Holland, he &s;urveyed the ea&s;tern &s;ide of that va&s;t continent, which had never before bene explored; di&s;covered the Strait between its northern extremity and New Guinea; and returning home by Savu, Batavia, the Cape of
<PB N="xxviii" REF="34">
Good Hope, and St. Helena, he arrived in Eng|land the 12th of July 1771.</P>
<P>In 1769, Captain Surville made a trading voy|age from &s;ome port in the Ea&s;t Indies by a new cour&s;e. He pa&s;&s;ed near New Britain, and fell in with &s;ome land in lat. 10&deg; &s;outh, long. 158&deg; Ea&s;t, to which he gave his own name; then &s;haping his cour&s;e to the &s;outh-ea&s;tward, narrowly mi&s;&s;ed New Caledonia, put into Doubtful Bay in New Zealand; and from thence &s;teered to the ea&s;t, be|tween the latitudes of 35 and 41&deg; &s;outh, till he arrived on the coa&s;t of America, a cour&s;e never before navigated; and with that pur&s;ued by Capt. Furneaux, between 48 and 52&deg;, and that after|wards by Capt. Cook, in a &s;till higher latitude, confirms, to demon&s;tration, the non-exi&s;tence of a &s;outhern continent.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was Capt. Cook's voyage compleat|ed, and his Journals examined, than another voy|age was projected, the chief object of which was to compleat the di&s;covery of the Southern He|mi&s;phere. Very extraordinary preparations were made for the equipment of the &s;hips for this voy|age, which required tho&s;e of a particular con|&s;truction to perform it&mdash;&s;uch therefore were pur|cha&s;ed. Some alterations likewi&s;e were nece&s;&s;ary in the &s;pecies of provi&s;ions u&s;ual in the navy, and the&s;e were made. Add to this, that many extra articles were provided, &s;uch as malt, &s;our krout, &s;alted cabbage, portable &s;oup, &s;aloup, mu&s;tard, marmalade, and &s;everal others, as well for food for convale&s;cents, as phy&s;ick for the &s;ick.</P>
<P>The &s;hips judged mo&s;t proper for the voyage were built for colliers, two of which were fitted up, and the command given to Capt. Cook; the large&s;t of 562 tons, called the Re&s;olution, had 112
<PB N="xxix" REF="35">
men, officers included; the other, the Adventure, of 336 tons, given to Capt. Furneaux, 2d in com|mand, had only 81. To the&s;e were added, per|&s;ons well &s;killed in Natural Hi&s;tory, A&s;tronomy, Mathematics, and the liberal Arts of Painting, Drawing, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July the two &s;hips &s;ailed from Plymouth, after having &s;ettled the latitude and longitude of that port by ob&s;ervation. This they did in order to regulate the time-pieces, of which they had four on board; three made by Mr. Ar|nold, and one by Mr. Kendal, on Mr. Harri&s;on's principles.</P>
<P>The great object of the voyage was to deter|mine, to a certainty, the exi&s;tence or non-exi&s;tence of a &s;outhern continent, which, till then, (as has already been related) had engaged the attention of mo&s;t of the maritime powers, and about the rea|lity of which Geographers of late &s;eemed to have had but one belief.</P>
<P>Let it &s;uffice, that this que&s;tion is at length de|cided: but before we enter upon the proofs ne|ce&s;&s;ary to decide that other que&s;tion, concerning the exi&s;tence or non-exi&s;tence of a N. W. or N. E. pa&s;&s;age, it will be expected, that we &s;hould not only lay before the reader the facts that have appeared in the cour&s;e of the voyages made in the Pacific Ocean, which we are now about to relate, but tho&s;e al&s;o that are to be gathered from the voyage made in the Atlantic Ocean for the like purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Not only Navigators the mo&s;t celebrated in their time, but even philo&s;ophers and co&s;mogra|phers of the fir&s;t eminence, have contended, from analogy, that a communication between the At|lantic and Great Pacific Ocean mu&s;t exi&s;t &s;ome|where in the Northern Hemi&s;phere, in like man|ner
<PB N="xxx" REF="36">
as the &s;ame exi&s;ts by the Straits of Magellan in the Southern Hemi&s;phere; this appeared &s;o certain to the Cabbots, the mo&s;t renowned Navi|gators of the 15th century, that the younger Se|ba&s;tian, at the ri&s;que of life, propo&s;ed the di&s;co|very of that pa&s;&s;age to Henry the VIIth; and though he failed by the mutiny of his crew, after he had &s;ailed as high as the 68th degree of northern latitude, yet that prince was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his endeavours, that he created a new office in his favour, and appointed him grand pilot of Eng|land, with a &s;alary of 1661. a year during life.</P>
<P>He returned by the way of Newfoundland, bringing home with him two E&s;quimaux.</P>
<P>It was long, however, before a &s;econd attempt was made with the profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of di&s;covering a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age. The attention of the nation was too much fixed on projects towards the &s;outh, to attend to any thing that had reference to en|terprizes in the north.</P>
<P>Some there were, however, who held the object in view: and in 1576 Sir Martin Forbi&s;her, with two &s;mall &s;hips, attempted the di&s;covery; and hav|ing found a Strait on the &s;outhernmo&s;t point of Groenland, through which he &s;ailed about fifty leagues, with high land on both &s;ides, he per&s;uaded him&s;elf that he had &s;ucceeded in his enterprize; but after repeated trials, finding his error, he gave over the &s;earch.</P>
<P>In a few years after Sir Martin, Sir Humphrey Gilbert renewed the hopes of the di&s;covery, by a voyage to the north, which, though it failed in the main point, it proved of infinite advantage to the nation in another. He coa&s;ted along the Ame|rican Continent from the 60th degree of northern latitude, till he fell in with the Gulph of St. Law|rence, which he continued to navigate till he per|ceived
<PB N="xxxi" REF="37">
the water to fre&s;hen; he then took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of that va&s;t continent, &s;ince called Canada by the French, in the name of his Sovereign; and was the fir&s;t who projected the fi&s;hery in Newfound|land, and who promoted the e&s;tabli&s;hment of it.</P>
<P>In proportion as the commerce to the ea&s;t in|cea&s;ed and became lucrative, the de&s;ire of en|gro&s;&s;ing the trade by &s;hortening the pa&s;&s;age thither increa&s;ed al&s;o; thence aro&s;e an emulation among the merchants for di&s;covering the pa&s;&s;age of which we are &s;peaking. Tho&s;e in London had concerted a plan for that purpo&s;e, and tho&s;e in the We&s;t Country had a &s;imilar plan in contemplation; but neither the one nor the other had managed their de&s;igns with &s;o much &s;ecrecy, but that each got acquainted with the other's intentions. This pro|duced a coalition; both agreed to join in the ex|pence; and both agreed in the appointment of Capt. John Davis, to conduct the voyage.</P>
<P>In 1585 he embarked on board the Sun-&s;hire, a bark of about 60 tons and 23 men, attended by a ve&s;&s;el of 35 tons with 19 men, to which he gave the name of the Moon-&s;hine. He &s;ailed from Dart|mouth on the 7th of May. The fir&s;t land he made was an i&s;land near the &s;outhernmo&s;t point of Groenland, which, from its horrid appearance, he named the I&s;land of De&s;olation. In this progre&s;s he pa&s;&s;ed the Strait that &s;till bears his name, and advanced as high as the latitude of 66 in an open &s;ea, the coa&s;ts of which he examined till the ap|proach of winter obliged him to return, with every hope, however, of &s;ucceeding another year. On his arrival, his employers were &s;o well plea&s;ed with the relation he gave, and the progre&s;s he had made, that they next year augmented his force, and &s;ent him out with four ve&s;&s;els, one of which, the Mermaid, of 120 tons burthen, he commanded
<PB N="xxxii" REF="38">
him&s;elf, and the other three (the Sun-&s;hine, Moon|&s;hine, and the North-&s;tar, a pinance of 13 tons only) were furni&s;hed with ma&s;ters of his own re|commendation.</P>
<P>On the 7th of May he &s;et &s;ail from Dartmouth, and &s;teered a &s;trait cour&s;e till he arrived in the 60th degree of latitude, when he divided his fleet, ordering the Sun-&s;hine and North-&s;tar to di|rect their &s;earch to the north-ea&s;tward as far as the 80th degree N. while he, with the Mermaid and Moon-&s;hine, &s;hould continue their former &s;earch to the N. W. where he had already contracted an acquaintance with the inhabitants in his former voyage, which he vainly hoped would facilitate his views. At fir&s;t they expre&s;&s;ed great joy at his return, but they &s;oon di&s;covered the cloven foot. They were fond of iron, and he gave them knives; knives did not content them, they wanted hatchets; when they got hatchets, they cut his cables, and &s;tole one of his coa&s;ting anchors, which he never recovered. He took one of the ring-leaders pri|&s;oner, who after &s;ome time proved a u&s;eful hand; but they in return &s;urprized five of his men, of whom they killed two, grievou&s;ly wounded two more, and the fifth made his e&s;cape by &s;wimming to the &s;hip with an arrow &s;ticking in his arm. In this voyage he coa&s;ted the land, which he found to be an i&s;land, from the 67th to the 57th degree N. and at length anchored in a fair harbour, eight leagues to the northward of which he conceived the pa&s;&s;age to lie, as a mighty &s;ea was &s;een ru&s;hing between two headlands from the we&s;t: into this &s;ea he ardently wi&s;hed to have &s;ailed; but the wind and current both oppo&s;ing his de&s;ign, he was ob|liged, by the remon&s;trances of his people, to relin|qui&s;h that &s;avage coa&s;t, and, as the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced, to return home. When he arrived he
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="39">
met with the Sun-&s;hine, but the North-&s;tar was never more &s;een.</P>
<P>His mi&s;fortunes did not abate his zeal. He was prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the certainty of a N. W. pa&s;&s;age, and he prevailed upon other adventurers, in conjunction with &s;ome of his former friends, to enable him to make a third trial, which proved no le&s;s unfortunate than tho&s;e he had attempted before; notwith&s;tanding which, could he have rai&s;ed friends to have defrayed the expence, he would have continued his re&s;earches till death had put an end to his labours.</P>
<P>The&s;e repeated di&s;appointments threw a damp for a while on this favourite pur&s;uit; and it was not till the year 1610, that the former &s;pirit of di&s;|covery began to revive.</P>
<P>In that year, Mr. Henry Hud&s;on projected a new cour&s;e towards the N. W. which brought him to the mouth of the Strait that now bears his name. This he traced till he came into an open &s;ea; but the &s;ea&s;on being pa&s;t for making any farther pro|gre&s;s at that time, he prevailed upon his crew, by flattering their avarice with the certainty of gain, to winter on that inho&s;pitable coa&s;t, though de&s;ti|tute of provi&s;ions for a &s;ingle month. While their provi&s;ions la&s;ted they were contented; and the tale of riches and glory that had been told them, cheri&s;hed their hopes; but when famine and cold began to pinch, the ideal pro&s;pect va|ni&s;hed, and nothing but murmuring and mutiny &s;ucceeded, which ended in the tragical death of the Captain, and &s;even of his &s;ick followers, who, unable to make re&s;i&s;tance, were &s;et adrift in the boat, while tho&s;e who were in better health &s;eized the &s;hip, and made the be&s;t of their way home; and on their return gave &s;uch an account of the
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="40">
certainty of the pa&s;&s;age, as left no room to doubt of the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the very next year Sir Henry Button undertook the ta&s;k, and &s;teered directly to the new-di&s;covered &s;ea, in which he &s;ailed more than 200 leagues farther to the S. W. than his predece&s;&s;ors, wintered at Port Nel&s;on, where he lo&s;t near half his men, and returned the next year, roundly a&s;&s;erting the exi&s;tence of the pa&s;|&s;age, though he had not been &s;o happy as to find it.</P>
<P>Sir Henry was &s;carce returned before James Hall and William Baffin &s;et &s;ail, with a view to &s;hare the honour of compleating the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>In this attempt Hall fell by the hands of a &s;a|vage, and Baffin &s;oon returned, but with a full de|&s;ign to renew his pur&s;uit, whenever he could find an opportunity &s;o to do. This did not happen till the year 1615, when he examined the &s;ea that communicates with Davis's Straits, which he found to be no other than a great bay, with an inlet from the north, to which he gave the name of Smith's Sound, in lat. 78.</P>
<P>About this time the Hud&s;on's Bay Company was e&s;tabli&s;hed, who by charter were obliged to pro&s;ecute this di&s;covery, as were likewi&s;e tho&s;e ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els that were employed in the whale fi&s;hery; but neither the one nor the other paid much attention to the chief object of their e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.</P>
<P>In the year 1631, Luke Fox, commi&s;&s;ioned by King Charles the Fir&s;t, made a voyage in &s;earch of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;age, but to as little purpo&s;e as the re&s;t.</P>
<P>He was followed by Capt. James, who after the mo&s;t elaborate &s;earch from one extremity to
<PB N="xxxv" REF="41">
the other of the bay, changed his opinion, and declared that no &s;uch pa&s;&s;age exi&s;ted; and it was not till a hundred years after, that Capt. Middle|ton undertook, upon the mo&s;t plau&s;ible grounds, and at the in&s;tance and by the recommendation of Arthur Dobbs, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> to make another attempt; which, though it was performed with equal zeal and fidelity, and though it might have carried conviction home to the mind of every unpreju|diced per&s;on, yet, as it was un&s;ucce&s;sful, it proved un&s;atisfactory. Mr. Dobbs, who had per&s;uaded him&s;elf that &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t exi&s;t &s;omewhere, from a friend became a mo&s;t implacable enemy, charging Capt. Middleton not only with want of will, but with want of hone&s;ty, and with a prede|termined de&s;ign of defeating the purpo&s;e of the voyage, being influenced thereto by the Hud&s;on's Bay Company, from whom, he in&s;inuated, the Captain had received a pecuniary reward.</P>
<P>Though this was equally injurious to the cha|racter of Capt. Middleton, and to the honour of the Company, yet Mr. Dobbs was in &s;uch high e&s;timation with the public, who are ever prone to favour that &s;ide on which their intere&s;t is depending, that he not only procured an Act of Parliament, &s;o framed as to facilitate his views, but had intere&s;t enough with a &s;ociety of private adventurers to fit out two &s;hips, the Dobbs and California, to re|examine the coa&s;ts which Capt. Middleton had vi|&s;ited, and to make farther re&s;earches, till they &s;hould di&s;cover the pa&s;&s;age, which, it was mo&s;t confidently a&s;&s;erted, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t, and which, when di&s;covered, would enrich the di&s;co|verers, and immen&s;ely increa&s;e the wealth and commerce of the nation.</P>
<P>As the act, which was obtained for the purpo&s;e of this voyage, was almo&s;t univer&s;ally condemned

as illiberal, partial, and inadequate, the reward of twenty thou&s;and pounds held forth by it, being confined to &s;hips belonging to his Meje&s;ty's <HI>&s;ub|jects &s;olely,</HI> by which not only tho&s;e of all other nations were excluded, but even tho&s;e belonging to his Maje&s;ty's navy placed in the &s;ame predica|ment; and what was thought &s;till more reprehen|&s;ible, it was &s;oon di&s;covered that this act, which openly profe&s;&s;ed to give encouragement of ALL his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, to make &s;earch for the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion, was yet confined to &s;uch &s;hips &s;olely as &s;hould di&s;cover it through <HI>Hud&s;on's Bay.</HI></P>
<P>With all this reward to enliven and invigorate the pur&s;uit, which, at the &s;ame time that it threw a damp on other adventurers, could not but re|animate the hopes of tho&s;e who were immediately engaged in the enterprize, the two &s;hips &s;et &s;ail; and having examined every inlet, every gulph, and every opening which had the lea&s;t appearance of a navigable Strait, they returned, as all that had gone before them had done, with a lamentable &s;tory of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they had &s;uffered, and the dangers they had &s;urmounted; but not yet fully convinced that the pa&s;&s;age which they went in &s;earch of did not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Dobbs, though le&s;s &s;anguine, but not le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied with tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the conduct of this voyage, than with that of their predece&s;|&s;ors, was &s;till &s;o immoveably attached to his own conceit, that he died in the firm belief that every mi&s;carriage that had happened, had originated through the management of the Hud&s;on's Bay Company. But the Hud&s;on's Bay Company very prudentially kept proofs in their own hands, that had they been called upon by Parliament to ac|count for their conduct, would have convinced the world how unju&s;tly they had been a&s;per&s;ed, and
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="43">
how fully they had complied, in every re&s;pect, with the terms of their in&s;titution.</P>
<P>The clamour, however, which Mr. Dobbs, and the gentlemen intere&s;ted in the &s;ucce&s;s of the voy|age, had found means to rai&s;e again&s;t the Com|pany, was &s;uch, as no longer to be di&s;regarded. Though they were convinced them&s;elves that no &s;uch pa&s;&s;age exi&s;ted within the limits of their char|ter, yet they found it nece&s;&s;ary to convince the nation likewi&s;e. They, therefore, about the year 1761, ordered a &s;loop to be built, for the &s;ole pur|po&s;e of re-exploring every inlet that had been left doubtful, but more particularly that called Che&s;|terfield's Inlet, which Mr. Ellis, who wrote the hi&s;tory of the voyage, had &s;poken of as NOT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF PROBABILITY. The com|mand of this &s;loop, named the Churchill, was entru&s;ted to Capt. Chri&s;topher, who executed his commi&s;&s;ion to the &s;atisfaction of his employers; but not having compleated his examination, &s;o as to leave no po&s;&s;ibility of any &s;uch Strait exi&s;ting, the Company, the year following, added to the &s;loop which Capt. Chri&s;topher commanded, a Cut|ter, of which Mr. Norton was appointed ma&s;ter; and both &s;et &s;ail for Che&s;terfield's Inlet, the extent of which the Captain, in his former voyage, and not been able wholly to a&s;certain.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;ummer of 1763, the&s;e two ve&s;&s;els &s;et &s;ail from Churchill River, and arrived at the mouth of Che&s;terfield's Inlet in the proper &s;ea&s;on; and notwith&s;tanding the oppo&s;ition they met with, from the difficulty of the navigation, and from the ob&s;tructions of the &s;hoals of ice they had to com|bat, they reached the extremity of the gulph, and found it to terminate in a va&s;t lake, more than &s;ixty miles in extent, into which a river of ordi|nary
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="44">
&s;ize, which took its ri&s;e among the moun|tains, after &s;everal falls, emptied it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus having traced to their &s;ource this and every opening as far as the 67th degree of northern latitude, beyond which no communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Seas could be of any u&s;e for the purpo&s;es of commerce; the Company re|linqui&s;hed, upon the mo&s;t &s;olid grounds, all farther &s;earch for it be &s;ea; but that no imputation &s;hould remain upon the Company for not fulfilling their engagements with the public in the ample&s;t man|ner, Mr. Dobbs having laid great &s;tre&s;s on what the Indians, who came from far to trade with the Company, had &s;aid of a river, which from the abundance of copper being found near it, had ob|tained the name of the Copper Mine River, wrote to the Governor of Fort Prince of Wales, to &s;end a proper per&s;on, under the convoy of &s;ome tru&s;ty Indians, to make an accurate &s;urvey of that fa|mous river, and to trace it from its &s;ource to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Mr. Hearne, a young gentleman of known cou|rage, and equally well qualified in every other re&s;pect, was made choice of for this enterpri&s;e. Accordingly, he &s;et out with his Indian convoy from Fort Prince of Wales, on Churchill's River, in lat. 58&deg; 50&prime;, on the 7th of December 1770, and directing his cour&s;e to the N. W. over one of the mo&s;t dreary and de&s;olate portions of the earth that any European ever cro&s;&s;ed, he arrived, the June following, at a place called Conge-catha-wha-chaga, where he had two good ob&s;ervations, by which he was enabled to determine the latitude of the place to be 68&deg; 46&prime; N. and, by computation, in longi|tude 24&deg; 2&prime; we&s;t of Churchill River.</P>
<P>On the 13th of July, &s;till continuing his cour&s;e to the W. of the N. he reached the head of the
<PB N="xxxix" REF="45">
Copper Mine River; which, in&s;tead of being na|vigable for &s;hipping, was at this place &s;carcely practicable for an Indian canoe.</P>
<P>Here, however, Mr. Hearne began his &s;urvey, previous to which three of his convoy were di&s;|patched as &s;couts, to gain intelligence if there were any E&s;quimaux about the river. The&s;e &s;couts in a few days returned, with an account that there were five huts of E&s;quimaux on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and, as they judged, at about twelve miles di&s;|tance. On this news, the Indian convoy paid no more attention to Mr. Hearne's &s;urvey, their whole thoughts being occupied in what manner to &s;teal upon the E&s;quimaux in the night, and to murder them while they were a&s;leep. The better to effect their bloody purpo&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary to cro&s;s the river; but, before they made the lea&s;t advance, they cleaned their arms, loaded their guns, and new painted their targets; &s;ome with the image of the &s;un; others with that of the moon; others with different kinds of birds and bea&s;ts of prey; but mo&s;t with the figures of furies, mon&s;ters, dae|mons, and other vi&s;ionary inhabitants of the dif|ferent elements of earth, air, and &s;ea. Upon en|quiry into the rea&s;on of this &s;uper&s;tition, Mr. Hearne was told, that each man painted on his target the figure of that being on which he mo&s;t relied for &s;ucce&s;s or protection.</P>
<P>This ceremony over, they began their march to the huts of the E&s;quimaux, always keeping the low grounds, and carefully avoiding the eminences. The number of the party that accompanied Mr. Hearne, being &s;uperior to that of the E&s;quimaux, and much better equipped, could &s;carcely have failed of rendering victory certain, had the attack been made in fair combat; but on that they did not wholly rely. Being arrived within 200 yards
<PB N="xl" REF="46">
of the huts undi&s;covered, they then halted, and endeavoured to per&s;uade Mr. Hearne to remain &s;tationary till the fight was over; but that gentle|man, apprehending more danger from being left alone, than by accompanying his convoy, re&s;olved to &s;hare with them the fortune of the day. They &s;eemed highly plea&s;ed with this in&s;tance of his courage, and pre&s;ently put into his hands a &s;pear and a poniard, but he had no target. By the time that all things were agreed upon and adju&s;ted, it was one in the morning, and all the un&s;u&s;pecting E&s;quimaux were fa&s;t a&s;leep; it was then they ru&s;hed &s;orth upon them, and with dreadful yells began the horrors of the ma&s;&s;acre. Being in a &s;ituation incapable of re&s;i&s;tance, men, women, and children, fell victims to &s;avage fury. The &s;hrieks and groans of the poor expiring multitude were truly horrible to a feeling heart; and this was much increa&s;ed in that of Mr. Hearne, by the &s;ight of a young girl, who being pierced with a &s;pear, fell down at his feet, and twi&s;ted round his legs in &s;uch a manner, as hardly to be di&s;engaged from her dying gra&s;ps. Her Mr. Hearne &s;olicited to &s;ave; but the two ruffians who pur&s;ued her made no reply, till their &s;pears had transfixed her to the earth, and then looking &s;ternly at him, they a&s;ked him, with a tone that denoted fury, if he was in want of an E&s;quimaux wife! He at that in&s;tant had fears for his own life for begging her's; and while &s;he was wreathing round their &s;pears in all the agonies of torture&mdash;horrible to tell!&mdash;Here Mr. Hearne, in his journal, throws a veil over the inhuman, and more than brutal &s;cene, as too &s;hock|ing for de&s;cription.</P>
<P>When they had compleated their dreadful car|nage, they di&s;covered, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, &s;even other huts, which the projecting cliffs
<PB N="xli" REF="47">
had hitherto concealed from their &s;ight. The&s;e they reconnoitred, and &s;eeing the E&s;quimaux in|habitants packing up their baggage, and preparing for action, but &s;eemingly not very apprehen&s;ive from any attack; to intimidate them, they began to fire upon them acro&s;s the river, which was here about eighty yards wide. The E&s;quimaux, who had never before heard the report of a gun, were &s;een eagerly gathering up the bullets which the rocks had flattened, till one man was wounded in the leg; they then took the alarm, fled to their canoes, and made good their retreat to the &s;hoals above. The Indians, who had now nothing to fear, began to plunder the huts, the inhabitants of which they had ju&s;t murdered; and having made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of as much copper as they could carry away, they a&s;cended a hill, and forming a circle with their &s;pears erect, gave &s;houts of victory, crying <HI>Tama! Tama!</HI> words of deri&s;ion and defiance to the fugitives below.</P>
<P>This ceremony over, they returned to their baggage, and re-cro&s;&s;ing the river to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;urvey, they ob&s;erved the E&s;quimaux, thinking they were gone, bu&s;y again about their huts. They ru&s;hed forward with a&s;toni&s;hing impetuo&s;ity, but the canoes of the E&s;quimaux being ready, they had embarked and fled, one man only re|maining, whom the Indians immediately &s;lew. They plundered the huts of what baggage was left, de&s;troyed them, and then returned to Mr. Hearne in joyful triumph.</P>
<P>It was about five in the morning, of the 17th of July 1771, when Mr. Hearne proceeded again to &s;urvey the river, which he found, all the way into the &s;ea, encumbered with &s;hoals and falls imprac|ticable to navigation. Being low water when he reached its mouth, he could determine the ri&s;e of
<PB N="xlii" REF="48">
the tide to be about 12 or 14 feet. This ri&s;e, on account of the falls, could carry a ve&s;&s;el of bur|then but a very little way: nor did it &s;low far, the water at eight miles di&s;tance having not the lea&s;t bracki&s;h ta&s;te.</P>
<P>By the time Mr. Hearne had compleated his &s;urvey of the river, it was about one in the morn|ing, of the 18th of Augu&s;t, when the &s;un in tho&s;e high latitudes is always a good height above the horizon. It then came on a very thick fog, with a drizzling rain; and as he had found the river and &s;ea in every re&s;pect unfit for commercial pur|po&s;es, he thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to wait for fair weather, to determine the latitude to greater ex|actne&s;s than he was already enabled to do by the ob&s;ervations he had made at Conge-catha-wha|chaga, by which he could calculate to 20 minutes, with certainty, the latitude of the mouth of the Copper Mine River, which he fixed at 72&deg; north, and long. 25 W. from Churchill River; that is, about 119 W. of Greenwich.</P>
<P>In Mr. Hearne's journey back from the Copper Mine River, tho&s;e who attended him met with an adventure, that, were it not reported on unque&s;|tionable authority, could hardly be believed. While they were out on a hunting party, they very unexpectedly cro&s;&s;ed a &s;now-&s;hoe track, and tracing it till they came to a little hut, they there found a young woman &s;itting alone, whom they brought to the tents. Being que&s;tioned as to her compa|nions, &s;he po&s;itively declared that &s;he was the only inhabitant within her knowledge. Being que&s;|tioned farther, as to her hi&s;tory, &s;he gave the fol|lowing account: That &s;he was one of the We&s;tern Dog-ribbed Indians, who live afar off towards the &s;etting &s;un; that the tribe to which &s;he belonged were &s;urprized in the night by the Arathape&s;cow
<PB N="xliii" REF="49">
Indians, and all murdered except her&s;elf and three other young women, who were made pri&s;oners; that while the Arathape&s;cow's were a hunting, &s;he found means to elope, and had concealed her&s;elf in the hut in which &s;he was found, for many months; that when &s;he was fir&s;t made pri&s;oner &s;he had a child, whom the women took from her, and killed it on the &s;pot; that &s;he had lived in that &s;olitude for more than nine moons, without &s;eeing a human face, and that &s;he had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted all the while by &s;naring hares, &s;quirrels, and other wild animals, which frequented the woods, &s;o that &s;he was at no lo&s;s for food; that &s;he once had a mind to return to her own country, but was deterred from attempting it by the di&s;tance, it be|ing many days journey to the we&s;tward, and &s;he had no conception left of the way. She had no|thing to make &s;nares of, but the &s;inews of rabbits legs and feet, which &s;he had found means to &s;trip, and had twi&s;ted them together for that purpo&s;e; and of their &s;kins &s;he had made a neat and warm winter's clothing. She had not been long at the tents, before half a &s;core Indians wre&s;tled to &s;ee who &s;hould have her for wife. Her country, &s;he &s;aid, was &s;o far off, that &s;he had never &s;een iron, or other metal, till taken pri&s;oner, tho&s;e of her tribe making their hatchets and chi&s;&s;els of deers horns, and their knives of &s;tone and bone; their arrows were &s;hod with deers horns, and their in&s;tru|ments to make their wood work were nothing but beavers teeth; they frequently heard of the u&s;eful materials the nations to the ea&s;t are &s;upplied with from the Engli&s;h; but in&s;tead of drawing nearer, to be in the way of trading for iron-work, were obliged to retreat farther back, to avoid the Ara|thape&s;cow Indians, who make &s;urprizing &s;laughter among them every year. Her &s;tory, though very
<PB N="xliv" REF="50">
affecting, having lo&s;t father, mother, brothers, and relations, all murdered in one night, &s;erved the &s;avages only for matter of mirth.</P>
<P>But while the Hud&s;on's Bay Company were thus employed, there was yet another expedition re|commended to his Maje&s;ty about the beginning of 1773, by the Royal Society, the chief object of which was to try how far navigation was practica|ble under the Poles. It was imagined, that the &s;un being there 33 degrees high about the middle of &s;ummer, and having little or no depre&s;&s;ion to|wards the horizon, might invigorate that part of the hemi&s;phere with more heat than in our cli|mate, where in the winter he is only 15 deg. high, and 16 hours in every 24 below the horizon, in which &s;pace the earth has time to cool, and to lo&s;e in the night the influence of heat it receives in the day. This con&s;ideration, added to the credit due to &s;everal well-authenticated relations, parti|cularly about the year 1670, when it was a&s;&s;erted and believed, that &s;everal Dutch &s;hips had actu|ally &s;ailed under the Pole, and the merchants in Holland being required to verify this fact, hav|ing grounded a petition for an exclu&s;ive charter to trade to China and Japan by a northern pa&s;&s;age, upon it; they produced the Journals of the Green|land &s;quadron of 1655, in &s;everal of which there was notice taken of a &s;hip which that year had &s;ailed as high as the latitude of 89; and three Journals of that &s;hip being examined, they all agreed as to one ob&s;ervation, taken by the ma&s;ter, Augu&s;t 1, 1655, in 88&deg; 56&prime; north, where the &s;ea was open, and the weather warm.</P>
<P>There were, however, &s;everal other important rea&s;ons which induced the Royal Society to re|commend this northern voyage to his Maje&s;ty, who having been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to counte|nance
<PB N="xlv" REF="51">
and encourage it, Capt. Phipps, now Lord Mulgrave, no &s;ooner heard of the de&s;ign, than he tendered his &s;ervice to carry it into execution. The board of longitude, at the &s;ame time, agreed with Mr. I&s;rael Lyons, a gentleman eminent in the &s;cience of A&s;tronomy, and an honour to the in&s;ti|tution where he fir&s;t received the rudiments of his education, [Chri&s;t's Ho&s;pital] to accompany Mr. Phipps, in order to fix the true places of &s;everal northern promontories, and for other nautical pur|po&s;es; and Dr. Irving likewi&s;e embraced that op|portunity to give the invention, for which he had received a parliamentary reward, a full trial.</P>
<P>In this voyage too, the Board of Longitude &s;ent two time-pieces for trial; one con&s;tructed by Mr. Kendall on Mr. Harri&s;on's principles; the other by Mr. Arnold on principles of his own: and Capt. Phipps had him&s;elf a pocket watch made by Mr. Arnold, by which he kept longitude with much greater exactne&s;s than was done by either of the other two, having varied only 2 min. 40 &s;ec. during the whole voyage.</P>
<P>On the 19th of April, Capt. Phipps, in the Race Hor&s;e, received his commi&s;&s;ion; and on the 30th of May was joined by Capt. Lutwidge in the Carca&s;e Bomb-Ketch at the Nore, where Mr. Lyons landed, and found Sheerne&s;s fort to lie in lat. 51&deg; 31&prime; 30&Prime; long, 30&prime; E.</P>
<P>On the 9th of June Capt. Phipps delivered Mr. Lutwidge his in&s;tructions, weighed, and pro|ceeded on his voyage.</P>
<P>On the 15th determined the po&s;ition of Hang Cliff, a remarkable point in the Shetland I&s;les, lat. 60&deg; 9&prime; long. 56&prime; 30&Prime; we&s;t of Greenwich.</P>
<P>On the 29th of the &s;ame month, he found him|&s;elf clo&s;e in with the land of Spit&s;bergen in 77 degrees North.</P>
<P><PB N="xlvi" REF="52">On the 2d of July mea&s;ured the altitude of &s;e|veral mountains. One was 1503 yards high.</P>
<P>On the 5th &s;teered directly for Hackluyt's Headland.</P>
<P>On the 10th, being entangled in the ice, and forced to haul up to weather a point, &s;et the fore|&s;ails, which, with the breeze fre&s;hening, gave the &s;hip &s;o much way, that &s;he pre&s;&s;ed thro' it with a violent &s;troke.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the &s;ymptoms of an approaching &s;torm obliged him to take &s;helter in Vogel Sang, a &s;mall i&s;land, the north-ea&s;termo&s;t point of which is known by the name of Cloven Cliff, lat. 79&deg; 53&prime; long. 9&deg; 59&prime; 30&Prime; E. Hackluyt's Headland, 79&deg; 47&prime; long. 9&deg; 11&prime; 30&Prime; E.</P>
<P>On the 30th, being in lat. 80&deg; 31&prime;, and long. 18&deg; 48&prime; E. the ice came all round the &s;hips, and pre&s;&s;ed &s;o clo&s;e that the &s;hips could no longer make &s;ail; yet the weather was fine, and the crews full of play.</P>
<P>But on the 5th of Augu&s;t the apprehen&s;ions of wintering in that &s;ituation began to increa&s;e, and the &s;ea being open to the we&s;tward, the carpenters were &s;et to work to enlarge the boats, and to make them commodious to tran&s;port the crews. As the &s;hips drove, and the water &s;hoaled hourly, the danger increa&s;ed. In the &s;ituation they were in, had either the ice or the &s;hips grounded, inevitable de&s;truction mu&s;t have en&s;ued.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the people were employed in haul|ing the boats over the ice. At that critical mo|ment, the ice about the &s;hips was ob&s;erved to open.</P>
<P>On the 10th, tho&s;e who were left on board pre&s;&s;ed the &s;hips, as it were by main force, through much heavy ice, and about noon got out to &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="xlvii" REF="53">And on the 11th anchored in Smeerenburg harbour, on the i&s;land of Spit&s;bergen; where they found four Dutchmen at anchor, on whom they had depended for a pa&s;&s;age home, had the &s;hips been locked up.&mdash;Thus ended this important voyage, for far as related to di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Capt. Phipps concludes the account of his voy|age with ob&s;erving, that by &s;etting out ju&s;t at the proper &s;ea&s;on, they not only reached the 80th de|gree of latitude, without meeting any ob&s;truction from the ice, but they had likewi&s;e time &s;ufficient to examine a track of icey coa&s;t between the lati|tudes of 80 and 81, extending more than 20 de|grees from W. to E. in which there did not exi&s;t the lea&s;t opening to the North, the whole being one continued wall of ice, impa&s;&s;able by human art.</P>
<P>All this being known to the Lords of the Ad|miralty, it might &s;eem an unnece&s;&s;ary expence to order any more &s;hips to be fitted out, to attempt &s;o hopele&s;s a di&s;covery from the Atlantic Ocean; yet, to leave nothing untried, other &s;hips were fitted out, and the command of the fir&s;t (the Lyon armed brig) was given to Lieut. Picker&s;gill, with orders "to proceed to Davis's Straits (fir&s;t), for the protection of the Briti&s;h whale fi&s;heries; and then, that object &s;ecured, to explore the coa&s;ts of Baffin's Bay, as far as in his judgment the &s;ame could be done without apparent ri&s;k; taking care to leave the &s;aid Bay &s;o timely, as to &s;ecure his re|turn to England in the fall; and it was further enjoined him, to make &s;uch nautical remarks as would be u&s;eful to Geography and Navigation. Picker&s;gill obeyed his in&s;tructions in the&s;e la&s;t in|&s;tances. He did make &s;ome u&s;eful ob&s;ervations, and he did return the &s;ame year; but the command of the next expedition into Baffin's Bay, was con|ferred
<PB N="xlviii" REF="54">
on Lieut. Young, with orders to endeavour to find a pa&s;&s;age on that &s;ide from the Atlantic to the Pacific Sea; and, if he &s;ucceeded in the at|tempt, to make the be&s;t of his way to Spithead or the Nore, there to remain till farther orders; but neither Lieut. Picker&s;gill nor Lieut. Young hav|ing &s;ucceeded; as, in truth, there could be no rea&s;onable foundation for &s;uppo&s;ing they would &s;ucceed, both the&s;e gentlemen &s;uffered in their nautical characters; the one, for improper beha|viour while he was commander; the other, as better adapted to contribute to the glory of a vic|tory, than to add to geographical di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>Such then has been the unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of all the voyages which have been undertaken for the di&s;covery of a pa&s;&s;age from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean; but it was not yet rendered cer|tain, that a pa&s;&s;age, nearly approaching to the extremities of the Gulphs that had already been di&s;covered on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the American Continent, might not be found on its we&s;tern &s;ide, as there is a remarkable note in Campbell's Voyages, on which that writer, who was a great advocate for the pa&s;&s;age in que&s;tion, lays great &s;tre&s;s, viz. that Capt. Lanca&s;ter, of the Dragon (afterwards Sir James), who commanded the fir&s;t fleet to the Ea&s;t Indies, having heard a report while there, of another pa&s;&s;age to that country, and being on his return home overtaken by a &s;torm, in which the Dragon lo&s;t her rudder, and was otherwi&s;e in danger of peri&s;hing, being determined not to de&s;ert her, wrote a letter, and &s;ent it on board the Hector, to which was added the follow|ing P. S. <Q REND="inline">"The pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t Indies lies in 62&deg; 30&prime; by the N. W. on the American &s;ide."</Q></P>
<P>It was therefore to determine this que&s;tion, with certainty, that our great Navigator relinqui&s;hed
<PB N="xlix" REF="55">
his honourable po&s;t of Governor of Greenwich Ho&s;pital, to engage in the conduct of an expedi|tion which nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;ed him to innumerable hard&s;hips, and to dangers which, unfortunately for his country, it was not his lot to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions under which he &s;ailed, if any credit may be given to public report, were planned by him&s;elf, and drawn up under his own imme|diate in&s;pection. And indeed, whoever con&s;iders the va&s;t objects they comprize, the judicious ar|rangements of the cour&s;e that was to be pur&s;ued, and the various operations that were to be carried into effect, will not he&s;itate a moment to pronounce that &s;uch a ma&s;terly compo&s;ition could not be the work of an ifficial clerk, let his talents and expe|rience in nautical affairs be ever &s;o exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>That the intelligent reader may enjoy the plea|&s;ure of peru&s;ing them, they are here in&s;erted at full length.</P>

<P>Secret In&s;tructions for Capt. James Cook, Com|mander of his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>WHEREAS the Earl of Sandwich has &s;ignified to us his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure, that an attempt &s;hould be made to find out a northern pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean; and whereas, we have, in pur&s;uance thereof, cau&s;ed his Maje&s;ty's &s;loops Re&s;olution and Di&s;covery to be fitted in all re&s;pects proper to proceed upon a voyage for the purpo&s;e above-mentioned; and from the experi|ence we have had of your abilities and good con|duct in your voyages, have thought fit to entru&s;t you with the conduct of the pre&s;ent intended voy|age, and, with that view, appointed you to com|mand
<PB N="l" REF="56">
the fir&s;t-mentioned &s;loop, and directed Capt. Clerke, who commands the other, to follow your orders for his further proceedings: You are hereby required and directed to proceed with the &s;aid two &s;loops directly to the Cape of Good Hope, unle&s;s you &s;hall judge it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;top at Madeira, the Cape de Verd, or Canary I&s;lands, to take in wine for the u&s;e of their companies; in which ca&s;e you are at liberty to do &s;o, taking care to remain there no longer than may be nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On your arrival at the Cape of Good Hope you are to refre&s;h the &s;loops companies, and to cau&s;e the &s;loops to be &s;upplied with as much provi&s;ions and water as they can conveniently &s;tow.</P>
<P>You are, if po&s;&s;ible, to leave the Cape of Good Hope by the end of October or the beginning of November next, and proceed to the &s;outhward in &s;earch of &s;ome i&s;lands &s;aid to have been lately &s;een by the French in the latitude of 48&deg; &s;outh, and about the meridian of Mauritius. In ca&s;e you find tho&s;e i&s;lands, you are to examine them tho|roughly for a good harbour; and upon di&s;covering one, make the nece&s;&s;ary ob&s;ervations to facilitate the finding it again, as a good port in that &s;ituation may hereafter prove very u&s;eful, although it &s;hould afford little or nothing more than &s;helter, wood and water. You are not, however, to &s;pend too much time in looking out for tho&s;e i&s;lands, or in the examination of them, if found, but to proceed to Otaheite, or the Society's I&s;les (touching at New Zealand in your way thither, if you &s;hould judge it nece&s;&s;ary and convenient) and taking care to arrive there time enough to admit of your giving the &s;loops companies the refre&s;hment they may &s;tand in need of, before you pro&s;ecute the farther object of the&s;e in&s;tructions.</P>
<P><PB N="li" REF="57">Upon your arrival at Otaheite or the Society I&s;les, you are to land Omiah at &s;uch of them as he may choo&s;e, and to leave him there.</P>
<P>You are to de&s;tribute among the Chiefs of tho&s;e i&s;lands &s;uch parts of the pre&s;ents with which you have been &s;upplied as you &s;hall judge proper, re&s;erving the remainder to di&s;tribute among the natives of the countries you may di&s;cover in the Northern Hemi&s;phere; and having refre&s;hed the people belonging to the &s;loops under your com|mand, and taken on board &s;uch wood and water as they may re&s;pectively &s;tand in need of, you are to leave tho&s;e i&s;lands in the beginning of Febru|ary, or &s;ooner, if you &s;hall judge it nece&s;&s;ary, and then proceed in as direct a cour&s;e as you can to the coa&s;t of New Albion, endeavouring to fall in with it in the latitude of 45&deg; N. and taking care in your way thither not to lo&s;e any time in &s;earch of new lands, or to &s;top at any you may fall in with, unle&s;s you may find it nece&s;&s;ary to recruit your wood and water.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o in your way thither &s;trictly en|joined not to touch upon any part of the Spani&s;h dominions on the we&s;tern continent of America, unle&s;s driven thither by &s;ome unavoidable acci|dent; in which ca&s;e you are to &s;tay no longer there than &s;hall be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and to be very careful not to give any umbrage or offence to any of the inhabitants or &s;ubjects of his Catholic Ma|je&s;ty: And if in your further progre&s;s to the northward, as hereafter directed, you find any &s;ubjects of any European prince or &s;tate upon any part of the coa&s;t you may think proper to vi&s;it, you are not to di&s;turb them, or give them any ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence, but, on the contrary, to treat them with civility and friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="lii" REF="58">Upon your arrival on the coa&s;t of New Albion, you are to put into the fir&s;t convenient port, to recruit your wood and water and procure refre&s;h|ments, and then to proceed northward along the coa&s;t as far as the latitude of 65&deg;, or farther, if you are not ob&s;tructed by lands or ice, taking care not to lo&s;e any time in exploring rivers or inlets, or upon any other account, until you get into the before-mentioned latitude of 65&deg;, where we could wi&s;h you to arrive in the month of June next. When you get that length, you are very carefully to &s;earch for and to explore &s;uch rivers or inlets as may appear to be of a con&s;iderable extent, and pointing towards Hud&s;on's or Baffin's Bay; and if, from you own ob&s;ervations, or from any in|formation you may receive from the natives (who, there is rea&s;on to believe, are the &s;ame race of people, and &s;peak the &s;ame language of which you are furni&s;hed with a vocabulary, as the E&s;qui|maux) there &s;hall appear to be a certainty or even a probability of a water pa&s;&s;age into the afore|mentioned bays, or either of them, you are in &s;uch ca&s;e to u&s;e your utmo&s;t endeavours to pa&s;s through with one or both of the &s;loops, unle&s;s you &s;hall be of opinion that the pa&s;&s;age may be effected with more certainty, or with greater probability, by &s;maller ve&s;&s;els; in which ca&s;e you are to &s;et up the frames of one or both the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els with which you are provided; and when they are put together, and are properly fitted, &s;tored, and victu|alled, you are to di&s;patch one or both of them, under the care of proper officers, with a &s;ufficient number of petty officers, men, and boats, in order to attempt the &s;aid pa&s;&s;age; with &s;uch in&s;tructions for their rejoining you, if they &s;hould fail, or for their further proceedings if they &s;hould &s;ucceed in the attempt, as you &s;hall judge mo&s;t proper.
<PB N="liii" REF="59">
But, neverthele&s;s, if you &s;hall find it more eligible to pur&s;ue any other mea&s;ures than tho&s;e above pointed out, in order to make a di&s;covery of the before-mentioned pa&s;&s;age (if any &s;uch there be) you are at liberty, and we leave it to your di&s;cre|tion to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures accordingly.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e you &s;hall be &s;atisfied that there is no pa&s;&s;age through to the above-mentioned bays, &s;uf|ficient for the purpo&s;es of navigation, you are, at the proper &s;ea&s;on of the year, to repair to the port of St. Peter and St. Paul, in Kamt&s;chatka, or wherever el&s;e you &s;hall judge more proper, in order to refre&s;h your people, and pa&s;s the winter; and in the &s;pring of the en&s;uing year 1778, to pro|ceed from thence to the northward, as far as in your prudence you may think proper, in further &s;earch of a north-ea&s;t or a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age from the Pacific Ocean or the North Sea: And if, from your own ob&s;evation, or any information you may receive, there &s;hall appear to be a probability of &s;uch pa&s;&s;age, you are to proceed as above di|rected: and having di&s;covered &s;uch pa&s;&s;age, or failed in the attempt, make the be&s;t of your way back to England by &s;uch route as you may think be&s;t for the improvement of geography and navigation, repairing to Spithead with both &s;hips, where they are to remain till further order.</P>
<P>At whatever places you may touch in the cour&s;e of your voyage, where accurate ob&s;ervations of the nature hereafter mentioned have not already been made, you are, as far as your time will al|low, very carefully to ob&s;erve the true &s;ituation of &s;uch places, both in latitude and longitude; the variation of the needle; bearings of head-lands; height, direction, and cour&s;e of the tides and currents; depths and &s;oundings of the &s;ea; &s;hoals, rocks, &amp;c. and al&s;o to &s;urvey, make charts, and
<PB N="liv" REF="60">
take views of &s;uch bays, harbours, and different parts of the coa&s;t. And to make &s;uch notations thereon as may be u&s;eful either to navigation or commerce. You are al&s;o carefully to ob&s;erve the nature of the &s;oil and the produce thereof; the animals and fowls that inhabit or frequent it; the fi&s;hes that are to be found in the rivers or upon the coa&s;t, and in what plenty; and in ca&s;e there are any peculiar to &s;uch places, to de&s;cribe them as minutely, and to make as accurate drawings of them as you can; and if you find any metals, minerals, or valuable &s;tones, or any extraneous fo&s;&s;ils, you are to bring home &s;pecimens of each; as al&s;o of the &s;eeds of &s;uch trees, &s;hrubs, plants, fruits and grains, peculiar to tho&s;e places, as you may be able to collect, and to tran&s;mit them to our Secretary, that proper examination and expe|riments may be made of them. You are likewi&s;e to ob&s;erve the genius, temper, di&s;po&s;ition, and number of the natives and inhabitants, where you find any, and to endeavour, by all proper means, to cultivate a friend&s;hip with them; making them pre&s;ents of &s;uch trinkets as you may have on board, and they may like be&s;t; inviting them to traffic; and &s;hewing them every kind of civility and regard, but taking care neverthele&s;s not to &s;uffer your&s;elf to be &s;urprized by them, but to be always on your guard again&s;t any accidents.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o, with the con&s;ent of the natives, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in the name of the King of Great Britain, of convenient &s;ituations in &s;uch countries as you may di&s;cover, that have not al|ready been di&s;covered or vi&s;ited by any other European power; and to di&s;tribute among the inhabitants &s;uch things as will remain as traces and te&s;timonies of your having been there; but if you find the countries &s;o di&s;covered are unin|habited,
<PB N="lv" REF="61">
you are to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them for his Maje&s;ty, by &s;etting up proper marks and in|&s;criptions as fir&s;t di&s;coverers and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>But fora&s;much as in undertakings of this na|ture, &s;everal emergencies may ari&s;e, not to be &s;ore&s;een, and therefore not particularly to be pro|vided for by in&s;tructions before-hand, you are, in all &s;uch ca&s;es, to proceed as you &s;hall judge mo&s;t advantageous to the &s;ervice on which you are em|ployed. You are, by all opportunities, to &s;end to our Secretary, for our information, accounts of your proceedings, and copies of the &s;urveys and drawings you &s;hall have made; and upon your arrival in England, you are immediately to repair to this office, in order to lay before us a full ac|count of your proceedings in the whole cour&s;e of your voyage; taking care before you leave the &s;loop to demand from the officers and petty officers the log-books and journals they may have kept, and to &s;eal them up for our in&s;pection; and en|joining them and the whole crew, not to divulge where they have been, until they &s;hall have per|mi&s;&s;ion &s;o to do; and you are to direct Capt.

<P>If any accident &s;hould happen to the Re&s;olution in the cour&s;e of the voyage, &s;o as to di&s;able her from proceeding any farther, you are, in &s;uch ca&s;e, to remove your&s;elf and her crew into the Di&s;covery, and to pro&s;ecute your voyage in her; her Commander being hereby &s;trictly required to receive you on board, and to obey your orders the &s;ame in every re&s;pect as when you were actually on board the Re&s;olution: And in ca&s;e of your inability, by &s;ickne&s;s or otherwi&s;e, to carry the&s;e in&s;tructions into execution, you are to be careful

<P>It remains now only briefly to enumerate the &s;tores and provi&s;ions that were ordered by his Maje&s;ty, under the direction of the Lords of the Admiralty, to be prepared for the compleat equip|ment of the expedition. Particular care was or|dered to be taken that the rigging of both &s;hips &s;hould be of the be&s;t quality, and that the quan|tities required of each &s;ort &s;hould be fully &s;up|plied; that every thing that had been found by the experience of former voyagers to be of u&s;e in pre&s;erving the health of the &s;eamen, &s;hould be furni&s;hed in abundance; that not only tho&s;e things that were immediately conducive to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and accommodation of the re&s;pective crews on board, but al&s;o what might be of permanent ad|vantage to the inhabitants of tho&s;e i&s;lands and countries where they might chance to be driven for relief or refre&s;hment. With this view, a bull, two cows with their calves, and &s;ome &s;heep, were put on board, intending to add to the&s;e other u&s;eful animals when they arrived at the Cape. From the &s;ame benevolent motive, great quanti|ties of European garden &s;eeds and roots were put on board, and both &s;hips were provided with &s;tore of iron tools, the mo&s;t u&s;eful, and tho&s;e be&s;t cal|culated for traffic, and to cultivate a friendly inter|cour&s;e with the inhabitants of &s;uch new countries as they &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to di&s;cover. Add
<PB N="lvii" REF="63">
to the&s;e, trinkets, toys, beads, looking-gla&s;&s;es, and nails without number.</P>
<P>But this was not all; the naval board had ob|jects of a more exten&s;ive nature in view; the im|provement of a&s;tronomy and navigation; the cul|tivation of &s;cience, and the important acqui&s;itions to natural hi&s;tory: the&s;e were all provided for, and proper in&s;truments and proper ma&s;ters were allotted for each. And for the more &s;triking de|lineation of tho&s;e memorable &s;cenes, and rare pro|ductions in nature that might pre&s;ent them&s;elves in the cour&s;e of &s;o ample a range as the circumna|vigation of the globe, painters and arti&s;ts were engaged to &s;upply the imperfections of written accounts, and to illu&s;trate what otherwi&s;e could not be fully de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Having now given a brief retro&s;pective view of all the voyages that have been undertaken with a view to di&s;covery in the great Pacific Ocean; and having likewi&s;e recounted the many un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts that have been made by the mo&s;t cele|brated navigators of our own nation for the di&s;|covery of a pa&s;&s;age between the two Great Seas in the Northern Hemi&s;phere, we &s;hall conclude this long introduction with only ob&s;erving, that the journal of the voyage that follows is not in reality the voyage of the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> but of the <HI>Di&s;covery</HI> that accompanied the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> without which the hi&s;tory of the voyage would be obvi|ou&s;ly incompleat.</P>

A VOYAGE, ON DISCOVERY, CAPT. COOK, COMMANDER.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing an Account of what happened in the Pro&s;ecution of the Voyage, from the Departure of the Ships with Omai, from England, in Augu&s;t 1776, till their leaving the Society I&s;lands, in the South Seas, Dec. 9th, 1777, to begin their Di&s;coveries to the North.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING taken in our guns at the Galleons, and what &s;tores were wanting,</P>
<P>On the 14th of June 1776, both &s;hips came to an anchor at the Nore; but our fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ions being nearly exhau&s;ted, we weighed next day, and left the Re&s;olution waiting for her Commander,</P>
<P>On the 16th, came too off Deal, and received on board a great quantity of beef and mutton
<PB N="2" REF="66">
for the &s;hip's company, and a boat for the Captain's u&s;e. It blew hard in the night and all the next day.</P>
<P>On the 18th we weighed anchor and &s;ailed; but we had no &s;ooner entered the channel than a &s;torm aro&s;e, by which we were driven into Port|land Roads, where we received con&s;iderable da|mage. We had blowing weather till</P>
<P>The 26th, when we arrived at Plymouth. There we found a large fleet of men of war and tran&s;ports with troops on board for America, and &s;aluted the Admiral with 11 guns. They had been driven in there by &s;tre&s;s of weather, &s;everal of them much damaged. About 12 at noon we came to moorings in the Sound.</P>
<P>On the 30th the Re&s;olution arrived, &s;aluted the Admiral, and came too and moored clo&s;e by us.</P>
<P>It was now found nece&s;&s;ary before we pro|ceeded, to go into harbour to repair the da|mages our &s;hip had received in the &s;torm of the 18th, and the Re&s;olution propo&s;ed to wait till we were in readine&s;s; but it was with difficulty that an order was obtained for the carpenters to begin, and when it was obtained, it was &s;ome time before it could be carried into execution. The repairs of the fleet for America being judged of greater con&s;equence than the repairs of a &s;hip commi&s;&s;ioned for di&s;covery.</P>
<P>The Re&s;olution, tired with delay, when the day came that &s;he &s;et &s;ail on her former voyage, which was</P>
<P>On the 12th of July, the impatience of the &s;hip's company, and the notion they had enter|tained of its being a lucky day, induced Capt. Cook to comply with their importunities, and he accordingly &s;et &s;ail, leaving orders with Capt.

Clerke to follow him to St. Jago, and if he &s;hould there mi&s;s of him, to pur&s;ue his cour&s;e directly for the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>This was unwelcome news to the &s;hip's com|pany of the Di&s;covery, who were equally impa|tient to &s;et &s;ail, and equally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of notions of lucky days with tho&s;e of their brethren in the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>During this tedious interval of unavoidable delay, a &s;uccinct account of Omai, the native of Ulietea, who embarked with Capt. Cook on board the Re&s;olution on his return home, will give tho&s;e who never had an opportunity of &s;eeing him while in England, &s;ome idea of his per&s;on, his genius, his character and acquirements.</P>
<P>This the Editor thought it his province to &s;upply; and has taken no &s;mall pains to collect from the writings of the gentlemen, who had the be&s;t opportunities of knowing and conver&s;ing with Omai while in England, their &s;entiments re&s;pecting him, which, though not entirely cor|re&s;ponding with the ideas of the Journali&s;t (as will be &s;een in the &s;equel) yet to do Omai am|ple ju&s;tice, the Editor thinks of it incumbent on him to conceal nothing that has appeared in his favour.</P>
<P>This man it appears, by the te&s;timony of Capt. Cook, had once &s;ome property in his own coun|try, of which he was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the people of Bolabola. Capt. Cook at fir&s;t wondered that Capt. Furneaux would encumber him&s;elf with &s;o ordinary a per&s;on, who was not, in his opinion, a proper repre&s;entative of the inhabitants of tho&s;e happy i&s;lands; and Mr. For&s;ter &s;ays, it is doing him no inju&s;tice to a&s;&s;ert, that among all the inha|bitants of Otaheite and the Society I&s;les, he had &s;een few individuals &s;o ill-favoured as Omai; nei|ther
<PB N="4" REF="68">
did he &s;eem of eminence in rank or parts, more than in &s;hape, figure, or complexion, to attract the notice of an enlightened nation, but &s;eemed, adds Mr. For&s;ter, to be one of the com|mon people; and the rather, as he did not a&s;pire to the Captain's company, but preferred that of the armourer and common &s;eamen to tho&s;e of &s;u|perior rank; yet, notwith&s;tanding the contempti|ble opinion, which both the&s;e gentlemen &s;eems to have entertained of him at fir&s;t, as &s;oon as he reached the Cape of Good Hope, and Capt. Cook had dre&s;&s;ed him in his own clothes, and introduced him to the be&s;t company, he then declared he was not a <HI>towtow,</HI> or one of the common cla&s;s, but a <HI>hoa,</HI> or attendant on the King; and Capt. Cook acknowledges, that &s;ince he arrived in England, he had his doubts whether any of the natives would have given more general &s;atisfaction. It will not, we pre&s;ume, be thought tedious if we add his cha|racter, as drawn by Capt. Cook and Mr. For&s;ter, in their re&s;pective hi&s;tories of the Voyage under|taken to determine the exi&s;tence or non-exi&s;tence of a Southern Continent, in 1772.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"Omai," &s;ays Capt. Cook, "has mo&s;t cer|tainly a good under&s;tanding, quick parts, and hone&s;t principles; he has a natural good behavi|our, which rendered him acceptable to the be&s;t company, and a proper degree of pride, which taught him to avoid the &s;ociety of per&s;ons of in|ferior rank. He has pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame kind as other young men, but has judgment enough not to indulge them in any improper exce&s;s. I do not imagine (adds the Captain) that he has any di&s;like to liquor, and if he had fallen into com|pany, where the per&s;on who drank the mo&s;t met with the mo&s;t approbation, I have no doubt but that he would have endeavoured to gain the ap|plau&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="69">
of tho&s;e with whom he a&s;&s;ociated; but for|tunately for him, he perceived that drinking was very little in u&s;e but among inferior people; and as he was very watchful into the manners and con|duct of the per&s;ons of rank who honoured him with their protection, he was &s;ober and mode&s;t; and I never heard, that during the whole time of his &s;taying in England, which was two years, he ever once was di&s;gui&s;ed with wine, or ever &s;hewed an inclination to go beyond the &s;tricte&s;t rules of moderation.</P>
<P>"Soon after his arrival in London, the Earl of Sandwich introduced him to his Maje&s;ty at Kew, where he met with a mo&s;t gracious reception, and imbibed the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of duty and gra|titude to that great and amiable Prince, which I am per&s;uaded he will pre&s;erve to the late&s;t mo|ment of his life. During his &s;tay he was care&s;&s;ed by many of the chief Nobility; but his principal patrons were the Earl of Sandwich, Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander."</P></Q></P>
<P>Capt. Cook adds, <Q REND="inline">"that though Omai lived in the mid&s;t of amu&s;ements during his re&s;idence in England, his return to his own country was always in his thoughts; and though he was not impatient to go, he expre&s;&s;ed a &s;atisfaction as the time of his return approached."</Q></P>
<P>Thus far Capt. Cook, in his own account of his Voyage for the Di&s;covery of a Southern Continent; and though there are &s;ome traits of this character to be di&s;cerned in that drawn by Mr. For&s;ter, yet his good qualities are there &s;o blended with child|i&s;hne&s;s and folly, that one can hardly think it ap|plicable to the &s;ame identical per&s;on.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"Omai," &s;ays Mr. For&s;ter, "has been con|&s;idered either as remarkably &s;tupid or very intelli|gent, according to the different allowances which
<PB N="6" REF="70">
were made by tho&s;e who judged of his abilities. His language, which is de&s;titute of every har&s;h con&s;onant, and where every word ends with a vowel, had &s;o little exerci&s;ed his organs of &s;peech, that they were wholly unfit to pronounce the more complicated Engli&s;h &s;ounds; and this phy&s;ical or rather habitual defect, has too often been mi&s;|con&s;trued. Upon his arrival in England, he was immediately introduced into general company, led to the mo&s;t &s;plendid entertainments, and pre|&s;ented at court amid&s;t a brilliant circle of the fir&s;t nobility. He naturally imitated that ea&s;y and elegant politene&s;s which is &s;o prevalent in all tho&s;e places; he adopted the manners, the occu|pations, and amu&s;ements of his companions, and gave many proofs of a quick perception and lively fancy. Among the in&s;tances of his intelligence, I need only mention his knowledge of the game of Che&s;s, in which he had made an amazing pro|ficiency. The multiplicity of objects which crowded upon him, prevented his paying due attention to tho&s;e particulars which would have been beneficial to him&s;elf and his countrymen at his return. He was not able to form a general comprehen&s;ive view of our whole civilized &s;y&s;tem, and to ab&s;tract from thence what appeared mo&s;t &s;trikingly u&s;eful and applicable to the improve|ment of his country. His &s;en&s;es were charmed by beauty, &s;ymmetry, harmony, and magnifi|cence; they called aloud for gratification, and he was accu&s;tomed to obey their voice. The continued round of enjoyments left him no time to think of his future life; and being de&s;titute of the genius of a Tupa&iuml;a, who&s;e &s;uperior abili|ties would have enabled him to form a plan for his own conduct, his under&s;tanding remained un|improved. After having &s;pent near two years
<PB N="7" REF="71">
in England, Mr. For&s;ter adds, that his judgment was in its infant &s;tate, and therefore (when he was preparing to return) he coveted almo&s;t every thing he &s;aw, and particularly that which amu&s;ed him by &s;ome unexpected effect: to gratify his childi&s;h inclinations, as it &s;hould &s;eem, rather than from any other motives, he was indulged with a portable organ, an electrical machine, a coat of mail, and a &s;uit of armour."</P></Q></P>
<P>Such is the account, and &s;uch the character of this child of curio&s;ity, who left his country and his connections, to roam he did not know where, nor for what, having no idea of improving the arts, manufactures, or commerce of his country, or introducing one u&s;eful art or &s;cience among them. He carried with him, be&s;ides the articles above enumerated, a profu&s;ion of almo&s;t every thing that can be named, axes, &s;aws, chi&s;&s;els, and carpenters tools of every kind; all &s;orts of Bir|mingham and Sheffield wares; guns, pi&s;tols, cut|la&s;&s;es, powder and ammunition; needles, pins, fi&s;h-hooks, and various implements for &s;port; nets of all &s;orts; with hand engines, and a lathe for turning. He had likewi&s;e clothes of different colours and different fabrics, laced and plain; &s;ome made in the &s;tyle of his country, and &s;everal after our manner: &s;ome of the&s;e la&s;t he bartered with the petty officers (after he had pa&s;&s;ed the Friendly I&s;lands) for red feathers. He was like|wi&s;e plentifully &s;upplied with gla&s;s and china wares, with beads and baubles, &s;ome of great value; medals of various metals; a watch was pre&s;ented to him by a per&s;on of di&s;tinction: in &s;hort, nothing was with held from him that he re|quired, either for trade in his own country, or to gratify his humour.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="72">When he came on board the Re&s;olution, he di&s;covered uncommon ec&s;ta&s;y; but when he parted with the gentlemen who accompanied him, the tears, as Mr. For&s;ter ob&s;erves, flowed plenti|fully; but they were childi&s;h tears; and the mo|ment his old friends had left the &s;hip, he was as lively and bri&s;k as ever. He &s;hewed no concern about leaving this country, but rather rejoiced at his going.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><P>"Omai," Capt. Cook &s;ays, "left London with a mixture of regret and &s;atisfaction. When he talked about England, and about tho&s;e who during his &s;tay had honoured him with their protection or friend&s;hip, I could ob&s;erve, that his &s;pirits were &s;en&s;ibly affected, and that it was with diffi|culty he could refrain from tears; but the in&s;tant the conver&s;ation turned to his own i&s;land, his eyes began to &s;parkle with joy."</P></Q></P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;equel how he behaved on board, and in what manner he was received on his return to his own i&s;land. Come we now to the departure of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t we weighed, and pro|ceeded, with all &s;ails &s;et, to join the Re&s;olution. While our &s;hip was repairing, it was ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e who had never been employed on di&s;|covery before, were more impatient to depart, than tho&s;e who had already experienced the &s;eve|rities of a Southern Navigation near and within the polar circle; and it was diverting enough to li&s;ten to the ludicrous remarks of the&s;e la&s;t, on their fre&s;h-water brethren as they called them, whom they ventured to foretel, would, like the Jews in the wilderne&s;s, be the fir&s;t to murmur and cry out for <HI>the leeks and the onions of Egypt</HI>; in|timating, that when the&s;e raw &s;ailors came among the i&s;lands of ice in the frozen regions, to <HI>feel</HI> the
<PB N="9" REF="73">
effects of &s;canty fare and hard duty, they would then be the fir&s;t to repent their impetuo&s;ity, and to &s;igh for the roa&s;t beef and porter of the land they were now &s;o de&s;irous to leave.</P>
<P>We proceeded with a bri&s;k gale till the 7th, when in &s;ight of Cape Fini&s;terre, the clouds began to darken, and the waves to &s;well, and to threaten, by every appearance, an approaching tempe&s;t. Several &s;hips were then in fight, and we could clearly di&s;cern that they were preparing, as well as our&s;elves, to meet the &s;torm. For twenty-four hours it blowed and rained ince&s;&s;antly; but on the 9th, a calm &s;ucceeded, which however was not of long continuance; for in the evening of the &s;ame day it thundered, lightned, and the rain poured down in torrents. The drops were &s;uch as no man on board had &s;een the like. To prevent the effects of the lightning, it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to let fall the chain from the ma&s;t-head: a precaution which Capt. Clerke never omitted, when there was danger from lightning to be apprehended.</P>
<P>On the 10th &s;eeing a &s;hip to windward bearing down very fa&s;t, and &s;u&s;pecting her to be an Ame|rican privateer, all hands were ordered to quar|ters, to be in readine&s;s to engage. She proved to be a Li&s;bon trader, who by the violence of the gale the day before, had been driven many leagues to the Ea&s;tward of her cour&s;e, and was in &s;ome di&s;tre&s;s. We &s;pared her tho&s;e things of which &s;he &s;tood mo&s;t in need, and pur&s;ued our voyage.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable till the 18th, when the &s;hip's company were put to &s;hort allowance of water, and the machine adju&s;ted to di&s;til &s;ea|water. This was occa&s;ionally made u&s;e of during the Voyage, and an&s;wered very well for particular purpo&s;es, but was &s;eldom or ever u&s;ed for
<PB N="10" REF="74">
boiling of meat. The&s;e precautions were taken, le&s;t the Re&s;olution &s;hould have left St. Jago, and the Di&s;covery been obliged to proceed to the Cape, without being able to procure a fre&s;h &s;upply.</P>
<P>On the 19th we cro&s;&s;ed the Tropic of Cancer for the fir&s;t time, and,</P>
<P>On the 28th came in fight of St. Jago, bearing N. W. di&s;tant about &s;ix or &s;even leagues. We bore away in&s;tantly for the Bay, and at eight in the morning made land. An officer was then &s;ent a&s;hore to make enquiry, who brought word that the Re&s;olution had not touched at that port; probably becau&s;e the rainy &s;ea&s;on was approach|ing, when it is un&s;afe to remain there during its continuance. The &s;ame rea&s;ons that had induced the Re&s;olution to proceed, were doubly pre&s;&s;ing upon us. It was now about the time when the rainy &s;ea&s;on begins, though as yet we had ob|&s;erved none of its approaches. It is generally preceded by a &s;trong &s;outherly wind, and a great &s;well. The &s;ea comes rolling on, and da&s;hing furiou&s;ly again&s;t the rocky &s;hore, cau&s;es a fright|ful &s;urf. Sometimes tornadoes or violent whirl|winds ari&s;e near the coa&s;t, and greatly increa&s;e the danger. For this rea&s;on, from the middle of Augu&s;t till the month of November, Port Praya, the principal harbour in the i&s;land, is but little frequented.</P>
<P>The officer was no &s;ooner returned, and the boat hoi&s;ted on board, than we made &s;ail with a gentle breeze, which continued till</P>
<P>Sept. 1&s;t, when a dreadful tempe&s;t aro&s;e, in which we every moment expected to peri&s;h. The thunder and lightning were not more alarming, than the &s;heets of rain, which fell &s;o heavy as to endanger the &s;inking of the &s;hip, and at the &s;ame time, though in the open day, involved us in a
<PB N="11" REF="75">
cloud of darkne&s;s, than which nothing could be more horrible; providentially the continuance of this tempe&s;t was but &s;hort; it began about nine in the morning, and before noon, the whole at|mo&s;phere was perfectly &s;erene, and not a &s;pot nor a &s;hade to be &s;een to mark the place of this elemental conflict. However, in this &s;hort pe|riod, our &s;ufferings nearly kept pace with our apprehen&s;ions, having our main-top-gallant yard carried away in the &s;lings, and the fail frittered to a thou&s;and pieces; the jib and middle &s;tay-&s;ails torn clear off, and the &s;hip &s;o &s;trained as to make all hands to the pump nece&s;&s;ary. The afternoon was employed in repairing the damages, and di&s;|charging the water which had been &s;hipped, as well from the heavens as from the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Sept. 2, 3, 4, the weather continued &s;qually, with rain; but as we approached the line, a calm &s;ucceeded, and the &s;ky became &s;erene; but with a hazine&s;s and languor, as if the current of the air, like water upon an equipoi&s;e, moved only by its own impul&s;e. Nothing could be more tedious and di&s;agreeable than this calm; but fortunately its duration was but &s;hort.</P>
<P>Sept. 5th, at eight in the morning, &s;aw a &s;ail, the &s;econd we had &s;een &s;ince we pa&s;&s;ed Cape Fi|ni&s;terre on the coa&s;t of Spain. We were at this time intent on fi&s;hing; and having hooked a &s;hark of an enormous &s;ize, both officers and men were engaged in getting him on board. When he was cut up, there were &s;ix young ones found in his belly, about two feet long each. The&s;e were divided among the officers, and one was dre&s;&s;ed for the great cabin. The old &s;hark was eaten by the &s;hip's crew, to whom fre&s;h food of any kind was now become a dainty.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="76">The weather continuing fine, the Captain or|dered the great guns and &s;mall arms to be exer|ci&s;ed, the &s;hip to be &s;moaked, and the bedding to be aired. The&s;e la&s;t articles, it may be once for all nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, were never omitted during the Voyage, when the weather would per|mit; but were more particularly nece&s;&s;ary in cro&s;&s;ing the Line, as it has been ob&s;erved that the wood-work between decks, in this low lati|tude, is more apt to become mouldy, and the iron to ru&s;t, than in higher latitudes, probably owing to that &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s in the air that has been already noticed, and for which Nature &s;eems to have provided a remedy by the frequent tem|pe&s;ts and tornadoes, to which this part of the ocean is remarkably &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Nothing worthy notice till the 17th, when we cro&s;&s;ed the Line. The weather being &s;qually, the u&s;ual ceremony of keel-hawling the &s;ailors who had never cro&s;&s;ed it before, was omitted. This ceremony is &s;o well known, that it were needle&s;s to de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>On the 19th, the weather became moderate, when upon examination, the &s;tarboard main tru&s;|&s;el-tree was found to be &s;prung.</P>
<P>On the 24th, George Harri&s;on, Corporal of Marines, &s;itting carele&s;ly on the bow&s;prit, divert|ing him&s;elf with the &s;porting of the dolphins, fell over-board. He was &s;een to fall, and the &s;hip was in&s;tantly hove to, and the boats got out with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; but he was never again &s;een to ri&s;e. His Dutch cap was taken up at the &s;hip's &s;tern; and as it was known that he was an excellent &s;wimmer, the boats made a large circuit round the &s;hip, in hopes to recover him, but in vain. It is remarkable, that in Capt. Cook's former Voyage, one Henry Smock, one of the

Carpenter's mates, &s;iting on the &s;kuttle, fell over|board much in the &s;ame manner, and &s;hared the &s;ame fate. Both the&s;e were young men, &s;ober, and of good characters. Their lo&s;s was regretted by the officers, but more particularly &s;o by their comrades among the crew. It is more than pro|bable, that both were in&s;tantly &s;wallowed up by &s;harks that con&s;tantly attend the &s;hips. Nothing remarkable till</P>
<P>Oct. 1, when we caught a large &s;hark, 10 feet long, with &s;everal young dolphins in her belly: part of the entrails, when clean&s;ed and dre&s;&s;ed, were eaten in the great cabin, and the body given to tho&s;e by whom it was caught. When fried, it is tolerable meat; but the fat is very loath&s;ome.</P>
<P>On the 22d, a &s;torm aro&s;e, accompanied with thunder, lightning, and rain. As it was not &s;o violent as tho&s;e we had before experienced, it proved more acceptable than alarming, as it &s;up|plied the &s;hip's company with a good quantity of fre&s;h water, which they caught in blankets, or by other contrivances, every one as he could. What was caught in the awnings was &s;aved for the officers u&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 24th it blew a hurricane&mdash;banded the &s;ails, and lay to all night under bare poles.</P>
<P>On the 25th, the &s;torm abated, and the &s;ky became clear; we ob&s;erved a &s;hip to the South|ward, which by her cour&s;e we took for the Re&s;o|lution. We crouded &s;ail, &s;tood after her, and &s;oon came up with her. She proved to be a Dutch advice-boat bound to the Cape.</P>
<P>On the 28th, our people began to look for land; and the appearance of &s;ome birds which are know never to go far from &s;hore, confirmed them that the extremity of the African coa&s;t was at no great di&s;tance. Our A&s;tronomer, however, was
<PB N="14" REF="79">
of a different opinion, and the event proved that he was right.</P>
<P>Nov. 1, having now been at &s;ea ju&s;t three months, without once &s;etting foot on land, tho&s;e who were unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch long voyages, began to put on a very different a&s;pect to that they were at fir&s;t &s;etting out. They were, indeed, &s;omewhat comforted by the chearfulne&s;s and vi|vacity which they ob&s;erved to prevail in almo&s;t every countenance except their own; from whence they concluded, that many days could not elap&s;e, before the painful &s;en&s;ations of a &s;oli|tary &s;ea life would be recompen&s;ed by the plea|&s;urable enjoyments they would find when they came on &s;hore. Such, perhaps, were the feelings at that time of the writer of this Journal.</P>
<P>On the 3d, we &s;till ob&s;erved a great variety of fi&s;h and fowl to accompany the &s;hip, &s;ome of which we had never noticed before; and we could not but remark the difference in this re&s;pect, be|tween the We&s;tern coa&s;ts of the Old Continent, and the We&s;tern coa&s;ts of the New, in the &s;ame latitudes. No &s;ooner had we cro&s;&s;ed the Tropic of Cancer, than we were amu&s;ed by the &s;porting of the joyous inhabitants of the deep, or more properly, perhaps, by their unremitting labour in pur&s;uit of their daily food. Flying fi&s;h are generally the fir&s;t to attract the notice of tho&s;e who never have been in the&s;e &s;eas before; and it is curious to attend to their numberle&s;s windings and &s;hiftings to elude the attacks of the Dolphins and Bonitos, their declared enemies. Whatever may be the de&s;ign of Providence in the formation of the&s;e unhappy beings, one cannot help con|&s;idering their exi&s;tence as a &s;tate of perpetual pu|ni&s;hment. While they remain in the water their enemies are there, and though Nature has given
<PB N="15" REF="80">
them the power to quit that element, and to fly for refuge to the open air, yet other per&s;ecutors are there al&s;o, no le&s;s cruel than tho&s;e they have e&s;caped. Boobies, Man of War birds, and other &s;ea fowls, are continually watching to make the Flying-fi&s;h their prey, while the ravenous Sharks are no le&s;s vigilant in making repri&s;als on the Dolphins and Bonitos. Thus, a pa&s;&s;age through the tropical latitudes, in this &s;ea, exhibits one continued &s;cene of warfare; while in the Southern Ocean, in the &s;ame latitudes, all is peace and uniform tranquillity. The&s;e reflections naturally occur, when the mind, unoccupied by variety, is di&s;po&s;ed for contemplation.</P>
<P>We too, who had contributed to play a part in this tragic &s;cene, by catching &s;everal enormous Sharks, left &s;ome few tyrants the le&s;s to vex the ocean.</P>
<P>On the 7th, at &s;ix in the morning, a man at the ma&s;t-head, called out land; and at eight we could all &s;ee it involved in a mi&s;ty cloud. It proved to be Table Land, bearing S. W. at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues, which induced us to change our cour&s;e from E. S. E. to S. S. W.</P>
<P>On the 10th we entered Table Bay, and</P>
<P>On the 11th, came to and anchored in &s;ix &s;a|thom water, where, to our great joy, we found the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>We &s;aluted the garri&s;on with 13 guns, and were an&s;wered by the &s;ame number: Capt. Cook, with the principal officers and gentlemen belong|ing to that &s;hip, came on board to bid us welcome. By them we learnt, that they had been at the Cape near three weeks; that in their cour&s;e they had touched at Teneri&s;&s;e for hay and corn for their live &s;tock; that they were there ho&s;pitably received; that the water was good, but, at that
<PB N="16" REF="81">
time, &s;carce: that they found Teneriffe a much more eligible place than Madeira to recruit their &s;tores; and that though the wine of the latter is mo&s;t certainly preferable to that of the former, it is &s;old in proportion, that of Madeira not being to be purcha&s;ed for le&s;s than 24l. a pipe, while that of Teneriffe co&s;t only 12l. They found the people in general civil and obliging; the air healthy, but the &s;oil barren. Santa Cruz, where they anchored, is well built; the churches decent, but not magnificent. They &s;tayed there only three days, and then continued their voyage to the Cape, without meeting with any thing worth remarking, except that in pa&s;&s;ing Bonavi&s;ta, they had but ju&s;t time to weather the breakers, con&s;e|quently their &s;ituation for a few minutes was cri|tical and alarming. They ju&s;t looked into Port Praya, in the i&s;land of St. Jago; and, not &s;eeing us, they pur&s;ued their cour&s;e; and on the 17th of October anchored in Table Bay, where they found two French Ea&s;t-India &s;hips, and one ju&s;t wrecked, and the cargo plundered by the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Before our arrival, a &s;torm had ari&s;en at the Cape, which la&s;ted three days, during which there was no communication between the &s;hips and the &s;hore, and the Re&s;olution was the only &s;hip in the bay that rode out the gale without dragging her anchors. On the 3d of November the &s;torm cea&s;ed; and Capt. Cook having landed his cattle, a bull and two cows, and 16 &s;heep, the dogs in the night got among the &s;heep, killed four, and di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t. Six of them, how|ever, were recovered the next day; but the two rams, and two of the fine&s;t ewes were among the mi&s;&s;ing; the two la&s;t were never recovered.</P>
<P>On our landing, our Captain was met by the officers of the garri&s;on, and the gentlemen be|longing to the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company, who
<PB N="17" REF="82">
received him very politely, and gave him a general invitation to &s;hare with them the entertainments of the place.</P>
<P>The &s;ubordinate officers on board, were met by another cla&s;s of inferior gentry, belonging to the &s;ame Company, with a like invitation, but on different terms. Almo&s;t every officer in the pay of the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company, furni&s;h &s;tran|gers with lodging and board, on moderate terms, from two &s;hillings a day to five.</P>
<P>Nothing in nature can make a more horrid ap|pearance than the rugged mountains that form the Bay. One would be tempted almo&s;t to think that the Dutch had made choice of the barrene&s;t &s;pot upon earth, to &s;hew what may be effected by &s;low indu&s;try and continued per&s;everance; for, be&s;ides the craggy cliffs that render the open coun|try almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible, the &s;oil is &s;o &s;andy and poor, that, except &s;ome vineyards, there is &s;carce a &s;hrub or a tree to be &s;een within any walking di&s;tance from the place.</P>
<P>In an excur&s;ion that Mr. Ander&s;on, Surgeon of the Re&s;olution, made in &s;earch of plants, he was &s;hewn a &s;olid &s;tone, half a mile in circumfer|ence at the bottom, and rounding to a point, like the dome of St. Paul's. Other writers &s;ay, this &s;tone is above a mile in circumference at the ba&s;e.</P>
<P>The town is &s;ituated below the mountains, and when &s;een from their &s;ummits, appears, with the gardens and plantations that run along the &s;hore, exceedingly picture&s;que: in &s;hort, nothing can be more romantic, nor any pro&s;pect more plea&s;ing to the eye.</P>
<P>Our &s;hip was no &s;ooner moored, than all hands were employed to &s;trip off the rigging, and to unload the &s;tores; places proper for repairing the one, and for airing and examining the other, be|ing
<PB N="18" REF="83">
prepared before-hand by Capt. Cook; and the utmo&s;t di&s;patch was made to &s;horten our &s;tay, as the time for navigating the high latitudes through which we were to pa&s;s, was advancing apace, and the Re&s;olution was already in a &s;tate fit to under|take the voyage.</P>
<P>What remained for Capt. Cook to do when we arrived, was chiefly to purcha&s;e live cattle for pre&s;ents to Erees in the South Sea; likewi&s;e live &s;tock for the &s;hip's u&s;e; the&s;e are always the la&s;t things provided, becau&s;e it is found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;horten, as much as po&s;&s;ible, their continuance on board. He had already laid in &s;ufficient &s;tore of beef, mutton, poultry, and greens for pre&s;ent u&s;e, and had contracted for a good quantity of &s;alted beef and bread, to &s;ave what we had brought from England, as tho&s;e articles are found to keep better than the beef and bread prepared at the Cape.</P>
<P>Among the cattle purcha&s;ed, were 2 young bulls, 2 heifers, 2 young &s;tone-hor&s;es, 2 mares, 2 rams, &s;everal ewes and goats, and &s;ome rabbits and poultry; all of them intended for New Zea|land, Otaheite, and the neighbouring i&s;lands, or other places where there was a pro&s;pect of their being &s;uffered to breed. Some dogs, too, were purcha&s;ed; cats we had in plenty.</P>
<P>Stored with the&s;e, the Re&s;olution re&s;embled the Ark, in which all the animals that were to &s;tock the little world to which he was bound were collected; and, with their provender, they occu|pied no &s;mall part of the &s;hip's &s;towage.</P>
<P>While we remained at the Cape, two Dutch &s;hips arrived full of &s;ick &s;oldiers, who had been enli&s;ted in Holland, and who were in a mi&s;erable condition both as to health and want of common nece&s;&s;aries. They had been near five months on
<PB N="19" REF="84">
their voyage from Am&s;terdam, and had lo&s;t on the pa&s;&s;age more men than the complements of both our &s;hips amounted to, owing to na&s;tine&s;s and clo&s;e confinement. It is remarkable, that no &s;hips have the appearance of being neater kept than tho&s;e of the Dutch; nor any more &s;lovenly, where they are not expo&s;ed to open view.</P>
<P>A very uncommon incident happened while we were at the Cape, which might have embroiled us with the government there, had not the delinquent been di&s;covered and puni&s;hed. It was ob&s;erved that a number of counterfeit &s;chellings and double keys had been circulated, and &s;everal of our people had taken them in exchange for gold. Complaint was made by us again&s;t the inhabitants, for taking the advantage of the ignorance of &s;trangers to im|po&s;e counterfeit money upon them, as it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they could be judges of the good|ne&s;s of their country coin. On the other hand, the inhabitants charged the bad money as proceeding from us. Each were warm in their repre&s;enta|tions, and each were po&s;itive in their opinions. It was not thought po&s;&s;ible that any of our people could be prepared to counterfeit Dutch money, and yet there had been no in&s;tance of counterfeit money having ever been &s;een at the Cape before the arrival of our &s;hips at that port. Thus the matter re&s;ted for a-while, till one of the &s;hip's armourers having obtained leave to go a-&s;hore, made him&s;elf drunk, and offered ba&s;e money in payment for his liquor. Being detained, and no|tice given his officer, he cau&s;ed him to be &s;earched, when &s;everal other pieces of a ba&s;e coin were found upon him. But it does not appear that this was &s;o &s;erious a bu&s;ine&s;s as our Journali&s;t has repre&s;ented it, who &s;ays, that to accommodate the matter with the Dutch, the delinquent was
<PB N="20" REF="85">
&s;ent home in the Hamp&s;hire Indiamen. It was the Cook that was &s;ent home in the Hamp&s;hire, becau&s;e he was a trouble&s;ome fellow.</P>
<P>[Capt. Cook &s;ays only, that he &s;ent home in the Hamp&s;hire an invalid, and was &s;orry he had not &s;ent two or three more.]</P>
<P>On the 27th of November, orders were given to prepare for &s;ailing. And,</P>
<P>On the 28th of the &s;ame month, the Governor and principal Officers belonging to the Company, were entertained on board the Re&s;olution, where they came to take leave of our Captains before their departure, as we were expected to &s;ail in a few days, the repairs of the &s;hips being fully com|pleated. The &s;tores had all been ordered on board &s;ome days before, and a large quantity of beer purcha&s;ed for the &s;hip's company at the only brewery that is publicly tolerated within the ju|ri&s;diction of the town. In &s;hort, there is not one nece&s;&s;ary article relating to the repairing, pro|viding, and victualling of &s;hipping, that is not to be purcha&s;ed at the Cape of Good Hope, and that too at very rea&s;onable prices. The wine at the Cape has been thought dear; becau&s;e that of the choice&s;t vintage is &s;carce, and, like the &s;tyre in England, confined to a very &s;mall &s;pot. Or the real Con&s;tantia, which is the wine &s;o much prized in Europe, the whole plantation does not perhaps produce more than forty pipes annually, though there may be two or three hundred di&s;|po&s;ed of under that name. The wine commonly taken on board the &s;hipping for the officers u&s;e, is of a kind not unlike Madeira, but of an inferior &s;ort, the vines here being rather impoveri&s;hed by rea&s;on of the dryne&s;s of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>On the 29th, our live &s;tock were all got on board, and properly provided for and &s;ecured;
<PB N="21" REF="86">
and having di&s;patched our letters to our friends, and left nothing to do but to weigh and &s;ail,</P>
<P>On the 30th, having quitted our moorings, we next day came to an anchor in 18 fathom wa|ter, Penguin i&s;land bearing N. by W. five or &s;ix miles.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of December, at three in the morn|ing, we took our departure, after &s;aluting the Fort with 11 guns, which they returned with the &s;ame number. At this time we ob&s;erved that luminous appearance about our &s;hips, which dif|ferent Voyagers have attributed to different cau&s;es. Dr. Franklin has endeavoured to account for it on the principles of electricity, but late voyagers have exploded that conceit. [On &s;ome of the water being taken up, it was found to abound with in|numerable &s;warms of a luminous animal, which the micro&s;cope di&s;covered to be like cray-fi&s;h.]</P>
<P>About five in the afternoon, we met with one of tho&s;e terrible gu&s;ts &s;o frequently experienced by Voyagers in doubling the Cape of Good Hope, in which our main-&s;ail was &s;plit, but fortunately we received no other damage.</P>
<P>On the 5th in the morning it blew a hurricane, and &s;plit the jib. About two in the afternoon, unbent and bent another.</P>
<P>On the 7th, the weather that had been cloudy and boi&s;terous ever &s;ince leaving the Cape, be|came clear and moderate. In latitude 39&deg; 57&prime; S. the Re&s;olution's boat, with Mr. King, the &s;econd Mate, and Omai on board, came to compare the time-pieces, and found no material variation.</P>
<P>On the 10th, in lat. 43&deg; 56&prime; a dreadful &s;torm came on, which obliged both &s;hips to lay to that and the following night, under bare poles.</P>
<P>On the 12th, in lat. 46&deg; 18&prime; it began to &s;how and hail, and the weather became intolerably
<PB N="22" REF="87">
cold; in&s;omuch, that from a &s;corching heat which we felt at the Cape, the change was &s;o great in the &s;pace of thirteen days, that we were obliged to line the hatchways with canvas, to de|fend the men below as much as po&s;&s;ible from the effects of the fro&s;t. Here the Albatro&s;&s;es and other &s;ea fowl, began to make their appearance; and here &s;eals and porpoi&s;es were &s;een to &s;port about the &s;hip, certain indications of approaching land.</P>
<P>On the 13th, at &s;ix in the morning, in lat. 46&deg; 53&prime;, and long. 37&deg; 46&prime; E. we came in &s;ight of land, having the appearance of two i&s;lands, the Ea&s;ternmo&s;t bearing S. S. E. &frac12; E. the We&s;ternmo&s;t S. by W. &frac12; W. To the&s;e Capt. Cook gave the name of Prince Edward's I&s;les. At ten in the forenoon, pa&s;&s;ed between the i&s;lands through a very narrow channel. Piercing cold, with &s;leet and &s;now, with which the i&s;lands were lightly co|vered, but neither tree nor &s;hrub was to be &s;een, nor any living thing, except penguins and &s;hags, the former &s;o numerous, that the rocks &s;eemed covered with them as with a cru&s;t. The&s;e were the Marion I&s;les, already di&s;covered.</P>
<P>M. de Marion, when he di&s;covered the&s;e i&s;lands, had two &s;hips under his command, one the Ma&s;|carin, Capt. Crozet, the other the Ca&s;trie, Capt. du Cle&s;mure. They proceeded to the Southern extremity of New Holland, and from thence to the Bay of I&s;lands in New Zealand, where M. de Marion was killed, with twenty-eight of his men, by the natives. He was obliged, having lo&s;t his ma&s;ts, to &s;earch for new ones in the woods of that country; but when he found trees fit for his pur|po&s;e, he found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of cutting a road three miles in length through the thickets, to bring them to the water-&s;ide. While
<PB N="23" REF="88">
one party of his people were employed in this &s;ervice, another party was placed on an i&s;land in the bay, to clean the ca&s;ks, and fill them with water; and a third was occa&s;ionally &s;ent on &s;hore to cut wood for the &s;hip's u&s;e. Thus employed, they had been there thirty-three days upon the be&s;t terms with the natives, who freely offered their women to the &s;ailors, when M. de Marion, not &s;u&s;pecting any treachery, went one morning, as his cu&s;tom was, to vi&s;it the different parties that were at work. Having called to &s;ee the wa|terers, he went next to the Hippah, a fortification of the natives, where he commonly u&s;ed to &s;top in his way to the carpenters. Here he was &s;ud|denly &s;et upon; and, with his few attendants, barbarou&s;ly butchered; as were the boats crew that carried him on &s;hore. Next morning, the Lieutenant who commanded on board, not know|ing what had happened, &s;ent a party to cut gra&s;s, and when every one was at work, the natives watched the opportunity to fall upon them like|wi&s;e, and murdered the whole party, except a &s;ingle &s;ailor, who ran for his life, and threw him|&s;elf, wounded, into the &s;ea. Being &s;een from the &s;hips, he was &s;peedily taken on board, and gave the general alarm. M. Crozet's &s;ituation, who commanded the Carpenters in the woods, was now become mo&s;t critical. A corporal and four marines were immediately di&s;patched to acquaint him of his danger, while &s;everal boats attended to receive his people. He di&s;po&s;ed every thing as well as the time would admit, and effected his retreat to the &s;ea-&s;ide. Here he found multitudes of the natives a&s;&s;embled, with a daring Chief at their head. M. Crozet ordered the marines who attended him, to direct their fire, if he gave the word, again&s;t &s;uch per&s;ons as he &s;hould point out.
<PB N="24" REF="89">
He then ordered the carpenters and convale&s;cents to &s;trike the tents, and the &s;ick to be embarked, while he, with the &s;oldiers, &s;hould talk with the leader. This man told them, that M. Marion was killed by a warrior, upon which M. Crozet &s;eized a &s;take, and forcing it into the ground, made &s;igns that he &s;hould advance no farther. The countenance with which this action was at|tended, &s;tartled the &s;avage, who&s;e courage failing him, M. Crozet in&s;i&s;ted on his ordering the crowd to &s;it down, which was accordingly complied with. He now paraded in front of the enemy, till all his people were embarked; his &s;oldiers were then ordered to follow, and him&s;elf was the la&s;t who entered the boat. He had &s;carce put off, when the whole body of the natives began their &s;ong of de|fiance, and di&s;charged their vollies of &s;tones; however, a &s;hot from the &s;hip &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them, and the company got all &s;afe on board. From this time the natives became trouble&s;ome, and made &s;everal attempts to attack his people by &s;urprize. They formed an attack again&s;t the wa|tering party in the night, which, but for the vi|gilance of the guard, would have been fatal to them; they afterwards openly attacked the &s;hips in more than a hundred large canoes, full of men, who had cau&s;e &s;orely to repent their audacity, and &s;everely felt the effect of European arms. At length, M. Crozet, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;up|ply the &s;hips with ma&s;ts, unle&s;s he could drive the natives from his neighbourhood, made an at|tack upon their Hippah, which they vainly boa&s;ted was beyond his power to approach. He placed the carpenters in the front, who in an in&s;tant le|velled their pali&s;adoes; then cut a breach through the mound, and levelled the ditch, behind which
<PB N="25" REF="90">
their warriors &s;tood in great numbers on their fighting &s;tages.</P>
<P>Into his breach a Chief in&s;tantly threw him&s;elf, with his &s;pear in his hand. He was &s;hot dead by M. Crozet's mark&s;men, and pre&s;ently another oc|cupied his place, &s;tepping on the dead body. He likewi&s;e fell a victim to his intrepid courage, and in the &s;ame manner eight Chiefs &s;ucce&s;&s;ively de|fended it, and bravely fell in this po&s;t of honour. The re&s;t, &s;eeing their leaders dead, took flight, and the French pur&s;ued and killed them with a heavy &s;laughter. M. Crozet offered fifty dollars to any per&s;on who &s;hould take a New Zealander alive, but this was found impracticable. A &s;ol|dier &s;eized an old man, and began to drag him towards his Captain, but the &s;avage, being di&s;|armed, bit into the fle&s;hy part of his enemy's hand, the exqui&s;ite pain of which &s;o enraged the &s;oldier, that he ran the fellow through the body with his bayonet. M. Crozet found great quan|tities of arms, tools, and clothing in this Hippah, together with &s;tore of dried fi&s;h and roots, which &s;eemed to be intended for winter provi&s;ion. He now compleated the repairs of his &s;hips without interruption, and pro&s;ecuted his voyage, after a &s;tay of &s;ixty-four days in this Bay of I&s;lands. From whence, after pa&s;&s;ing through the We&s;tern part of the South Sea, he returned by the Phi|lippines, to the I&s;le of France. But to proceed.</P>
<P>On the 14th, the weather began to clear up, and the&s;e i&s;lands, &s;ix in number, promi&s;ing no refre&s;hment, both &s;hips pur&s;ued their cour&s;e to the S. E. wind W. S. W. a bri&s;k gale, but piercing cold. The other four i&s;lands retain their former name. Our Captain ordered the jackets and trow&s;ers to be delivered out, which, with the blankets and other warm clothing, provided by
<PB N="26" REF="91">
the Lords of the Admiralty, again&s;t the &s;everity of the frozen climates, were found of infinite u&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 17th, in lat. 48&deg; 27&prime;, the fogs came on &s;o thick that we could but ju&s;t di&s;cern the large&s;t objects at the di&s;tance of the &s;hip's length. This being fore&s;een, fog-&s;ignals were appointed, and repeated every half hour.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable till</P>
<P>The 20th, when we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olu|tion. Signal guns were fired, fal&s;e fires lighted, and lights hung at the ma&s;t-head; but no an&s;wer received.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, in the morning, the fog &s;till con|tinuing, a very heavy &s;torm came on, attended with &s;leet, and frequent gu&s;ts with hail. All this day we continued firing &s;ignal guns, and at night burning fal&s;e fires, and carrying lights at the ma&s;t-head; but all to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 22d, the gale &s;till increa&s;ing, we car|ried away our jib &s;heer, and &s;plit the jib; but in the evening it cleared up, and fortunately for both &s;hips, the Re&s;olution came in &s;ight, which re|vived the drooping &s;pirits of the crews.</P>
<P>We were now accompanied with a great variety of &s;ea fowl, among which were, pintadoes. &s;heerwerers, fulmers, and grey peterels, which la&s;t &s;eldom appear at any con&s;iderable di&s;tance from land.</P>
<P>On the 23d, (an&s;wering to the middle of June in the Northern Hemi&s;phere) the weather cleared up, and we were proceeding at a great rate, all reefs out, when on a &s;udden the weather coming on hazy, increa&s;ed to a fog, and we again lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olution; but on ringing the fog bell, and firing a gun, we were an&s;wered by our con&s;ort, to our inexpre&s;&s;ible joy.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="92">About twelve at noon the fog began to di&s;per&s;e, a clear &s;un-&s;hine brightened the horizon, and &s;hewed that we were at no great di&s;tance from land. This, indeed, was not unexpected by our Commander. The man at the ma&s;t-head announced it; but as it &s;eemed at a great di&s;tance, very lofty, with the &s;ummits of its hills involved in mi&s;t, &s;ome of our officers who had accompanied Capt. Cook in his former voyages, and had experienced many di&s;appointments from the fallacious re&s;emblance of ice i&s;lands to tho&s;e of land, expre&s;&s;ed their doubts. However, the nearer we approached it, the more convinced we were of its reality. But what &s;eemed to us very &s;ingular, the &s;ea began to change its complexion, and from a dark green colour, to look white like milk; we had indeed ob&s;erved the like phaenomenon before, on cro&s;|&s;ing the Tropic in the Northern Hemi&s;phere; but do not recollect any &s;uch appearance no|ticed by former Voyagers in the&s;e high South|ern latitudes.</P>
<P>On the 24th, we ob&s;erved great quantities of &s;ea-weed floating on the &s;urface, and the &s;ea-birds to increa&s;e; and before noon were &s;o near the land as to di&s;cover rocks towering one upon ano|ther, as we imagined, to an immen&s;e height; but could di&s;cern no plantations or other indications of its being inhabited. As the coa&s;t appeared bold and rocky, it was judged proper to proceed with caution. When we fir&s;t di&s;covered land, it bore South; but on advancing &s;lowly, we came in &s;ight of a &s;eparate i&s;land, bearing S. E. by S. which, in the direction we fir&s;t beheld it, &s;eemed to be part of one and the &s;ame i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 25th, at &s;ix in the morning, wore &s;hip, and &s;tood in for the land; we pa&s;&s;ed the tremen|dous rock, which fir&s;t came in view, and which
<PB N="28" REF="93">
ro&s;e to an a&s;toni&s;hing height in form of a &s;ugar|loaf, and bore away to the Lee I&s;land, where we found a bay with good anchorage in 24 fathom water, cozy bottom; but the &s;urf rather rough, and inconvenient for landing and watering.</P>
<P>On the 25th, at four in the morning, the boats were &s;ent out to reconnoitre the coa&s;t, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover a more convenient harbour for taking in water. About &s;even they returned, having found a bottle with a letter inclo&s;ed, im|porting, that in January 1772, this i&s;land was di&s;covered by M. de Kerguelen; that it con|tained plenty of water, but no wood; that it was barren and without inhabitants; but that the &s;hores abounded with fi&s;h, and the land with &s;eals, &s;ea lions, and penguins. The harbour where this bottle was depo&s;ited, being more com|modious than that in which the &s;hips were anchor'd, and Capt. Cook intending to keep Chri&s;tmas here, and refre&s;h his men, gave orders to weigh, and the &s;hips to change their &s;tation; which orders were in&s;tantly obeyed.</P>
<P>The contents of the letter inclo&s;ed in the bottle were the&s;e: <Q REND="inline">"Ludovico XV. Galliorum Rege, &amp; de Boynes Rege &agrave; Secretis ad res Maritimas, annis 1772 &amp; 1773."</Q> But though the above in|&s;cription was all that the bottle contained, the hi&s;tory of M. De Kerguelen's voyage was well known, and is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to render our account of the di&s;coveries in the South Seas compleat.</P>
<P>This Navigator was only a Lieutenant in the French &s;ervice, but had the command of two &s;hips given him, the La Fortune and Le Gros Ventre, or the purpo&s;e of Di&s;covery. He &s;ailed from the Mauritius about the latter end of 1771, and on the 13th of January following, di&s;covered
<PB N="29" REF="94">
the i&s;les of which we are now &s;peaking, and to which he gave the names of the I&s;les of Fortune. Soon after he had made land, other land of a con&s;iderable extent and height came in &s;ight, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be Continent, upon which he &s;ent one of the officers of his own &s;hip a-head in the cutter to &s;ound. But the wind blowing fre&s;h, the Captain of the other &s;hip (M. de St. Allouarn) in the Gros Ventre, &s;hot a-head, and finding a bay to which he gave his &s;hip's name, ordered HIS yawl to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In the mean time, M. de Kerguelen being driven to leeward, and unable again to recover his &s;tation, both boats returned on board the Gros Ventre, and the cutter was cut a-drift on account of the bad weather. M. Kerguelen returned to the Mauritius, and M. de St. Allouarn continued for three days to take the bearings of this land, and doubled its North|ern extremity, beyond which it trended to the South-ea&s;tward. He coa&s;ted it for the &s;pace of twenty leagues; but finding it high and inacce&s;&s;i|ble, and de&s;titute of trees, he &s;haped his cour&s;e to New Holland, and from thence returned by way of Timor and Batavia, to the I&s;le of France, where he died; but previous to that event, he was promoted to the command of a &s;ixty-four gun &s;hip, called the Rolland, with the frigate l'Oi&s;eau, in order to perfect the di&s;covery of this pretended Continent; but returned with di&s;grace, pretend|ing again to have made the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>That the i&s;lands we now fell in with are the &s;ame di&s;covered by Kerguelen, there cannot re|main a doubt; but that M. de Kerguelen ever &s;aw a great country, &s;uch as he pretends, in or near tho&s;e i&s;lands, is very problematical. There are, indeed, numberle&s;s i&s;lands thinly &s;cattered in this almo&s;t boundle&s;s ocean, as every day's ex|perience
<PB N="30" REF="95">
demon&s;trates; but that there is not one &s;o &s;uperior to tho&s;e already di&s;covered, in riches and cultivation, as to be worth the &s;earch, will &s;carcely admit of a que&s;tion.</P>
<P>We now, moored in a &s;afe harbour, were bu|&s;ied on board in repairing our rigging, which had &s;uffered much in the frequent &s;qualls to which we had been &s;ubject ever &s;ince our departure from the Cape; at the &s;ame time, tho&s;e who were on &s;hore, were no le&s;s u&s;efully employed in &s;upplying the &s;hips with water, and the crews with fre&s;h provi&s;ions; which la&s;t, though not of the mo&s;t delicate kind, yet, to &s;tomachs cloyed almo&s;t to loathing, with &s;alt provi&s;ions, even &s;eals, pen|guins, and &s;ea-fowl, were not un&s;avoury meat.</P>
<P>On the 27th, our repairs being nearly com|pleated, and a great part of our water &s;hipped on board, Chri&s;tmas was proclaimed, and the har|bour where the &s;hips lay, named Chri&s;tmas Har|bour: On this occa&s;ion, a double quantity of grog was &s;erved out to each common man, and a certain proportion of wine and &s;pirits to every petty officer. Leave was likewi&s;e given to &s;uch as were ailing, to go a-&s;hore for the benefit of the land air; and the officers of both &s;hips reci|procally met in compliment to each other; pa&s;t dangers were forgotten, and the day was &s;pent by the common &s;ailors with as much mirth and unconcern as if &s;afely moored in Port&s;mouth harbour.</P>
<P>On the 28th, parties were &s;ent out to procure what vegetables the i&s;land produced by way of refre&s;hment; but none were found for culinary purpo&s;es, except a kind of wild cabbage, and that in &s;mall quantities, and gathered with much labour among the cliffs of the rocks. Mr. Nel&s;on, a gentleman whom Mr. Banks &s;ent out to collect
<PB N="31" REF="96">
&s;uch varieties as he &s;hould find indigenous to the i&s;lands and climates through which he &s;hould pa&s;s, found growing among tho&s;e cliffs, a kind of yellow mo&s;s of a &s;ilky &s;oftne&s;s, which he had not yet di&s;covered in any of his former re&s;earches.</P>
<P>On the 29th, the Re&s;olution weighed, having fir&s;t left a memorial written on the other &s;ide of the parchment found in the bottle, in the follow|ing words: <Q REND="inline">"Naves Re&s;olution &amp; Di&s;covery de Rege Magnae Britanniae, Decembris, 1776,"</Q> with a view to &s;urround the i&s;land, and to explore the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, which, however, upon examina|tion, was found equally barren, craggy, &s;teep, and de&s;olate, with that we had ju&s;t left. Pen|guins and &s;ea-lions were its chief inhabitants, among which our people made great havock; of the former for the &s;ake of provi&s;ions, penguins having been found tolerable eating when fre&s;h, or ju&s;t &s;alted; and of the latter, for blubber, which was afterwards boiled, and converted into oil, on our arrival at New Zealand.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame day, at nine in the morning, we weighed, and took leave of Chri&s;tmas Harbour, which we found by ob&s;ervation to lie in lat. 48&deg; 41&prime; S. and in long. 69&deg; 4&prime; E. and Capt. Cook, in obedience to his in&s;tructions, proceeded to com|pleat the Di&s;covery which had been left imperfect by French Voyagers. During this and the fol|lowing day, we endeavoured to circumnavigate the whole clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, and anchored in a harbour, to which Capt. Cook gave the name of Port Palli&s;er, in honour of the Admiral of that name, &s;ituated in lat. 49&deg; 3&prime; S. and long. 69&deg; 37&prime; E. Here we compleated our water, and recon|noitered the coa&s;t, which we found barren beyond de&s;cription. No quadrupeds, but &s;eals were &s;een on the&s;e i&s;lands.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="97">On the 1&s;t of January, 1777, we ob&s;erved great quantities of &s;ea-weed pa&s;&s;ing to leeward, in a direction contrary to that we had &s;een in ap|proaching the i&s;land, which gave rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e there were other lands at no great di&s;tance; and in fact other lands pre&s;ented, but not more fertile than tho&s;e we had pa&s;&s;ed. The navigation here we found mo&s;t dangerous. The &s;ea-weed, which grows to an a&s;toni&s;hing length, not le&s;s than 60 fathom, covers &s;unken rocks, which we might be &s;aid miraculou&s;ly to have e&s;caped. But having e&s;caped, we now pur&s;ued our cour&s;e for Van Dieman's Land, and having no di&s;coveries in view, took every advantage of the weather to carry &s;ail. While we were exploring this de&s;olate coa&s;t, two young bulls, one heifer, two rams, and &s;everal of the goats, died. Nothing more re|markable pre&s;ented till</P>
<P>The 14th, when a hurricane aro&s;e, accompa|nied with &s;o thick a fog, that our &s;hips were every moment in danger of falling foul one of the other. We kept the fog bell con&s;tantly ringing, and guns firing, which were an&s;wered by the Re&s;olution. The wind blew with &s;uch violence, that we were obliged to take in all our &s;ails, to &s;trike our top-gallant-ma&s;ts, and to &s;cud under our bare poles. This &s;torm continued with more or le&s;s violence till the 19th, during which time the Re&s;olution had carried away her fore-top-ma&s;t, and fore-top-gallant ma&s;t and yard; and the Di&s;covery had lo&s;t her top-gallant-&s;ails, &s;plit her middle &s;tay-&s;ails, and had &s;carce half a yard remaining of her jib.</P>
<P>On the 20th, in the morning, we lay by to repair our rigging; and the weather brightening up with a bri&s;k but moderate gale in the afternoon, we &s;et all the &s;ails we could, unreefed our top-&s;ails,
<PB N="33" REF="98">
and run at the rate of &s;even and eight miles an hour by the log, both &s;hips in company.</P>
<P>On the 22d, the weather continuing clear and moderate, Mr. King, the &s;econd Mate of the Re|&s;olution, come on board, to compare the time-pieces. He brought word that the &s;hip's crew were in perfect health, tho&s;e only excepted who had been hurt by their mi&s;&s;es at the Cape, and even tho&s;e were fit to do duty; and that the damage the Re&s;olution had received during the blowing weather, was not &s;o con&s;iderable as might have been expected.</P>
<P>On the 24th, in the morning, the man at the ma&s;t-head called out, Land, di&s;tant about five leagues, the Mew&s;tone, &s;o called by Capt. Fur|neaux, in 1773, bearing N. E. &frac12; E. Made the &s;ignal for &s;eeing it, which was an&s;wered by the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>On the 25th, &s;ounded and found ground at 55 fathom, &s;andy and &s;helly bottom.</P>
<P>On the 26th, &s;tood off and on to find the bay, called by Ta&s;man, Frederic Henry's Bay.</P>
<P>On the 27th came to, and moored in 14 fathom water, in Adventure Bay, of which Cape Frederic Henry forms the North Point, and was pre&s;ently joined by the Re&s;olution. No &s;ooner were the &s;hips properly &s;ecured, than the pinnace was or|dered to be launched, the boats to be manned, and all hands &s;et to work in wooding, watering, cutting gra&s;s for the cattle, over-hauling the rig|ging, and getting every thing in readine&s;s to con|tinue our voyage.</P>
<P>The officers, a&s;tronomers, and gentlemen on board both &s;hips eagerly embraced the opportunity of going a-&s;hore to take a view of this delightful country, with the appearance of which all on board were charmed. The fir&s;t thing that at|tracted
<PB N="34" REF="99">
our notice, were the trees, that by their magnitude and loftine&s;s exceeded every thing we had ever &s;een of the kind: but, what was re|markable, we found many of them burnt near the ground, and not a few lying in a horizontal po&s;i|tion, which, being much &s;corched, had been thrown down by the violence of the wind.</P>
<P>On the 28th, Capt. Cook, accompanied by officers and gentlemen from both &s;hips, and guarded by a party of marines, made a &s;econd excur&s;ion into the country, in order to make di&s;|coveries, and to procure, if po&s;&s;ible, an inter|view with &s;ome of the inhabitants; they pene|trated &s;everal miles through paths that &s;eemed to have been frequented, before they could get &s;ight of any human being.</P>
<P>On our part (meaning the Journali&s;t and his party) we happened to be more &s;ucce&s;sful; for by pa&s;&s;ing by the edge of an almo&s;t im|penetrable thicket, we heard a ru&s;tling, which at fir&s;t we mi&s;took for the rouzing of &s;ome wild bea&s;t; but, &s;earching clo&s;ely, we found it to be a girl, quite naked and alone. At fir&s;t &s;he &s;eemed much frightened; but, being kindly treated, and her apprehen&s;ions of death removed, &s;he became docile, and ready to an&s;wer every thing we could render intelligible to her under|&s;tanding. We que&s;tioned her concerning her re|&s;idence, which we did by pointing to every beaten path, walking a little way in it, and then return|ing and taking another, making motions to her at the &s;ame time to lead us along, and we would follow her. To make her quite ea&s;y, one of our company pulled off his handkerchief and put it about her neck, by way of ornament, and another covered her head with his cap, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her. She ran among the bu&s;hes, and in le&s;s than
<PB N="35" REF="100">
an hour nine men of the middle &s;tature made their appearance, naked but armed, according to the fa&s;hion of their country; the&s;e were intro|duced to the officers, and kindly treated; one gen|tleman giving to one a part of his clothing, ano|ther putting &s;omething upon a &s;econd, and &s;o on, till each had received &s;ome trifling ornament for his per&s;on, and all took their flight at once, and vani&s;hed in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>[The&s;e they received with &s;toical indifference; and Capt. Cook, ob&s;erving a &s;tick in one of their hands, was curious to know how he u&s;ed it, and having made him&s;elf under&s;tood, one of them &s;et up a piece of wood at the di&s;tance of 20 yards, and threw at it, but with no great dexterity; on which Omai, to &s;hew how much &s;uperior our weapons were to theirs, fired his mu&s;ket at it.]</P>
<P>It was not long, however, before the girl we had fir&s;t &s;een returned, and with her &s;everal wo|men, &s;ome with children on their backs, tied by a kind of hempen &s;trings, and &s;ome without chil|dren. The&s;e were likewi&s;e kindly received, and led to the place where the wooders were at work, with whom it was not long before they became acquainted. They were, however, mo&s;t mi&s;er|able looking objects; and Omai, though led by natural impul&s;e to an inordinate de&s;ire for women, was &s;o di&s;gu&s;ted with them, that he fired his piece in the air to frighten them from his &s;ight, which, for that time, had the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>Capt. Cook's rea&s;on for Omai's firing his piece, as above, was, no doubt, the true one, tho' it was very natural for our Journali&s;t, who heard the re|port and &s;aw the effect, to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on he did, not knowing any other.</P>
<P>On the 28th, we extended our excur&s;ions &s;till farther into the country, and found it beautifully
<PB N="36" REF="101">
diver&s;ified with hills and vallies, &s;tately groves of trees, rivers, meadows and lawns of va&s;t extent, with thickets full of birds of the mo&s;t beautiful plumage, parrots and paroquets, and birds of various notes, who&s;e melody was truly enchant|ing; be&s;ides the&s;e, we found &s;ome lagoons full of ducks, teal, and other wild fowl; of which we got great numbers, while our Naturali&s;ts were loading them&s;elves with the &s;pontaneous produc|tions of the &s;oil; a &s;oil, we may venture to &s;ay, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t fertile of any in the habitable globe, the trees growing to an a&s;toni&s;hing height and &s;ize, and not more beautiful to the eye than they are grateful to the &s;mell. We found &s;ome that ro&s;e ninety feet high without a knot, and of a girt that, were we to report it, would render the credit of the report doubtful. It was now the time when Nature pours forth her luxuriant ex|uberance to clothe this country with every va|riety; but, what appeared &s;trange to us, the few natives we &s;aw were wholly in&s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;eemed to live like the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t, in roving parties, without arts of any kind, &s;leeping in &s;ummer, like dogs, under the hollow &s;ides of the trees, or in wattled huts made with the low branches of ever-green &s;hrubs, &s;tuck in the ground at &s;mall di&s;tances from each other, and meeting in a point. Mr. Ander&s;on ob&s;erves, that what the antient poets tell of <HI>fawns</HI> and <HI>&s;a|tyrs</HI> living in hollow trees, is here realized.</P>
<P>Our fi&s;hermen were no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful in fi&s;hing during our &s;tay, than our &s;port&s;men in &s;hooting wild fowl; &s;o that nothing was wanting to make our living here de&s;irable.</P>
<P>On the 30th, the poor wretches of natives be|ing now dive&s;ted of their fears, i&s;&s;ued from the thickets like herds of deer from a fore&s;t, and
<PB N="37" REF="102">
drew them&s;elves up in ranks on the beech, making &s;igns for our people to come on &s;hore, probably with a view to partake of our bounty, certainly not with any de&s;ign to do us any harm. They were indeed armed with lances about twelve feet long, terminated by a &s;hark's tooth, or piece of bone &s;harpened to a point, which they threw to a great di&s;tance, but to no great nicety. The&s;e lances were the whole of their armour.</P>
<P>There were among them, as among all the in|habitants of the countries of the Southern Ocean, &s;ome to whom the multitude &s;eemed to pay obe|dience, though even the&s;e were here without any marks of di&s;tinction, other than what Nature had be&s;towed upon their per&s;ons. This indelible dig|nity, through all the cla&s;&s;es of animal nature, has marked &s;ome to rule, while others, de&s;titute of that advantage, willingly &s;ubmit, and are con|tented to obey. To the&s;e Chiefs, as no quadru|peds, except a creature of the opo&s;&s;um kind, about twice the bigne&s;s of a cat, were &s;een in the country, Capt. Cook offered a boar and a &s;ow; [but on their &s;eizing them eagerly, he found the crea|tures would have no chance of life; he therefore re&s;umed them, and afterwards left them, loo&s;e, in the clo&s;e&s;t thicket he could find] where it is po&s;|&s;ible they might have a better chance to breed than among the ferocious inhabitants of New Zealand, where &s;everal of them formerly had been turned loo&s;e, but very &s;oon de&s;troyed. He al&s;o offered them nails, knives, beads, and other trifles, to which they paid little or no attention, but were greedy after &s;hreds of red cloth.</P>
<P>It does not appear that the natives here are canibals, or indeed that they feed much upon fle&s;h, as no appearance of any &s;uch food could be traced among them, fowls only excepted. Fi&s;h,
<PB N="38" REF="103">
fruit, and the natural productions of the earth, were the only articles of food that were ob&s;ervable about their fire-places; but, what was &s;till more &s;trange, there was neither canoe nor boat to be &s;een, though the country abounded &s;o much in timber. It may therefore be rea&s;onably con|cluded, that the&s;e natives are a &s;ort of fugitives, who have been driven out from &s;ome more pow|erful community, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t here in a &s;tate of bani&s;hment; as it is hardly po&s;&s;ible otherwi&s;e to conceive &s;o fine a country po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a people, wholly de&s;titute of all the arts of civil life.</P>
<P>It is true, very different de&s;criptions have been given of the per&s;ons of tho&s;e poor wretches; Capt. Cook had formerly reported that their hair was &s;trait, and only clotted up with grea&s;e and na&s;ti|ne&s;s; while others in&s;i&s;ted on their being woolly-headed, tho' not quite &s;o deeply coloured as the African blacks, yet their &s;kins are generally made &s;o by a kind of paint. The women are remark|ably ugly.</P>
<P>On the 30th, having been here and on the coa&s;t near &s;even days, and having got plenty of wood and water on board, and whatever el&s;e the country afforded, the &s;ignal was made for un|mooring. By ten in the morning the &s;hips were under &s;ail, and at twelve Cape Frederic Henry bore N. by W. We &s;et out with an ea&s;y gale; but, before night, &s;qualls came on, which made it nece&s;&s;ary to double reef our top-&s;ails, and &s;o to continue till break of day. [This gale was indi|cated by the barometer; for the wind no &s;ooner began to blow, than the mercury in the tube be|gan to fall.]</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of February we &s;et our top-gallant &s;ails, both &s;hips in company, &s;teering a direct cour&s;e for New Zealand, and in nine days came

in &s;ight of Adventurer's I&s;land, di&s;tant about nine or ten leagues from Charlotte Sound.</P>
<P>On the 10th we were off Charlotte's Bay, our de&s;tined place of rendezvous.</P>
<P>On the 12th, in &s;tanding for the Sound, the Di&s;covery had the misfortune to &s;trike upon a rock; but, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Re&s;olution, was warped off without receiving any con&s;iderable da|mage; and about two in the afternoon, both &s;hips moored in nine fathom water.</P>
<P>Not a man on board who did not now think him&s;elf at home, &s;o much like Great Britain is the i&s;land of New Zealand. It is between &s;ix and &s;even hundred miles in length, but varying in breadth, being broade&s;t towards the middle, and narrowing at the extremities. In this it &s;eems to differ from the regular cour&s;e of nature in the formation of i&s;lands, and even of continents, where, like in&s;ects, they &s;eem to be divided in the middle, and only connected together by an incon&s;iderable &s;pace. Almo&s;t every i&s;land of any extent in the Southern Ocean is divided in this manner. The continent of Europe, A&s;ia, and Africa, is held together by a thread, in compari|&s;on, at the i&s;thmus of Suez; and North and South America, in like manner, at that of Darien.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner &s;ecurely moored in Char|lotte Sound, together with the Re&s;olution, than the natives came in droves to welcome our arrival; to bring us fi&s;h, and to offer to trade; but every hand being then employed, little or no notice was taken of their overtures; &s;ome of our people were bu&s;y in carrying out the tents, others in erecting them on &s;hore; &s;ome in forming in|trenchments for the &s;ecurity of the &s;tores, and &s;ome in un&s;hipping &s;tores; in &s;hort, not an idle per&s;on being to be found to attend them, the &s;a|vages,
<PB N="40" REF="106">
thinking them&s;elves neglected, departed, &s;eemingly very much di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>[For this behaviour Capt. Cook a&s;&s;igns ano|ther cau&s;e: This &s;hyne&s;s, he &s;ays, was to be accounted for only upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that they were apprehen&s;ive we had revi&s;ited their country, in order to revenge the death of Capt. Furneaux's people.]</P>
<P>On the 13th, we had hard &s;qualls, with heavy rain. During the intervals of &s;un-&s;hine, we ob|&s;erved &s;everal water-&s;pouts, but none near us. Mr. For&s;ter, who accompanied Capt. Cook in his former voyage, in his pa&s;&s;age from Du&s;ky Bay to this Sound, had frequent opportunities of ob&s;erving the&s;e phaenomena, and has given the following de&s;cription of them. Their ba&s;e, he &s;ays, where the water of the &s;ea was violently agi|tated, and ro&s;e in a &s;piral form in vapours, was a broad &s;pot, which looked bright and yellowi&s;h, when illuminated by the &s;un. Directly over this &s;pot, a cloud gradually tapered into a long &s;len|der tube, which &s;eemed to de&s;cend to meet the ri&s;ing &s;piral, and &s;oon united with it into a &s;trait column of a cylindrical form. We could di&s;|tinctly ob&s;erve the water hurled upwards with the greate&s;t violence, and it appeared that it left a hollow place in the centre. He adds, that the&s;e water-&s;pouts made the olde&s;t mariners unea&s;y; all, without exception, had heard dreadful accounts of their pernicious effects, when they happen to break over a &s;hip; but none had ever been &s;o be|&s;et with them before.</P>
<P>On the 14th, at &s;even in the morning, the pin|naces of both &s;hips were ordered to be manned, and both Captains went on &s;hore, with other gen|tlemen, to reconnoitre the country, without ven|turing too far at fir&s;t, for fear of a &s;urprize. Be|fore
<PB N="41" REF="107">
they landed, they were ob&s;erved by an old man, who approached the &s;hore, holding a green bough in his hand, and waving it in &s;ign of peace, which was in&s;tantly an&s;wered by hoi&s;ting a white flag. Friend&s;hip being thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, we all landed, and the old man began an oration, accompanied by very &s;ignificant ge&s;tures, and a theatrical di&s;play of the pa&s;&s;ions by various mo|dulations of his voice, till at length he concluded in a plaintive tone, which we interpreted to mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. This done, he &s;aluted the company, according to the cu&s;tom of the &s;outhern i&s;landers, by joining no&s;es; a mode, though not the mo&s;t agreeable, yet nece&s;&s;ary to be complied with for the &s;ake of peace. Capt. Cook, more earne&s;t to examine the &s;tate of the plantations which he had cau&s;ed to be laid out, and &s;owed with garden &s;eeds in his former voyage, than to pur&s;ue the &s;ports of fi&s;hing and fowling, which chiefly en|gaged the attention of other gentlemen while on &s;hore, went with Capt. Clerke to vi&s;it the inclo|&s;ures on Long I&s;land, and found many of the plants and roots in a flouri&s;hing condition, though it did not appear that any care had been taken to dre&s;s, or even to weed them, by the natives. In|deed it &s;hould &s;eem that this part of the country, like that of Du&s;ky Bay, is but thinly inhabited, and probably occa&s;ionally only, as none of their towns were found within any rea&s;onable di&s;tance of the &s;hore. Some &s;traggling huts, in|deed, in which &s;ingle families were found to re|&s;ide, were now and then di&s;covered in the rece&s;&s;es of the woods, but no regular plantations, the ef|fects of indu&s;try, were ob&s;ervable in any part of this &s;ound. Their canoes, and their clothing, were works of great labour; but where the for|mer was performed could only be gue&s;&s;ed at,
<PB N="42" REF="108">
though it appeared that the latter was the &s;ole employment of their women.</P>
<P>During our re&s;idence here, though nothing was to to be found but vegetables and fi&s;h, &s;uch was the plenty of both, that loads of the former were to be procured for the labour of cutting and carrying away; and of the latter, as much as was &s;ufficient for the &s;u&s;tenance of one per&s;on a whole day for a &s;ingle nail.</P>
<P>It had been ob&s;erved by former Voyagers, that the women in this i&s;land were cha&s;ter, when fir&s;t vi&s;ited by our people, than tho&s;e in the warmer climates, probably owing to the phy&s;ical effects of their colder con&s;titutions; not to the re&s;triction of any law, or the force of cu&s;tom, nor to that de|licacy of &s;entiment that naturally excites tho&s;e &s;ympathetic &s;en&s;ations that in a more advanced &s;tate of refinement &s;erve to bind the &s;exes in the indelible bonds of mutual fidelity. But, to what|ever cau&s;e it might be owing, before the loo&s;er pa&s;&s;ions, by their commerce with the European &s;ailors, took root among them, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have been found to thrive &s;o well, that they now exceed all others in indulging them. Even the men are now become &s;o abandoned, as to pro&s;ti|tute their very wives for a nail, and to lay no re|&s;traint on their daughters, of whom the men make little account.</P>
<P>It was no &s;ooner known that our &s;hips were moored in Charlotte Sound, than the natives flocked from the remote&s;t corners of the i&s;land to traffic for nails, broken gla&s;s, beads, or other European trumpery, for which they would &s;ell their arms, clothes, and whatever el&s;e they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, not even re&s;erving their working implements, which they could not replace with|out infinite labour.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="109">The women, who accompanied the&s;e com|mercial emigrants, were no le&s;s &s;aleable than the wares they brought; and the favours of many were purcha&s;ed by the &s;eamen, who, though the fir&s;t price was trifling, co&s;t them dear in the end. This traffic was carried to a &s;hameful height, and Omai, who, from natural inclination and the li|centious habits of his country, felt no re&s;traint, indulged his almo&s;t in&s;atiable appetite with more than &s;avage indecorum.</P>
<P>Before our pre&s;ent arrival, it had been que&s;|tioned, even by Capt. Cook, whether the&s;e i&s;landers would &s;ell their children to &s;trangers; but experience has now taught us, that there is nothing they will not &s;ell for iron, &s;o great is their de&s;ire for that metal. The love of gold is not more prevalent in Europe, than the love of iron in New Zealand. The &s;tory which Capt. Cook relates, in proof of the irre&s;i&s;tible force of Nature in the retentive care of their children, only &s;hews, that he him&s;elf had erred in the conclu&s;ions he had drawn from it; for the Captain lived to &s;ee that the favourable opinion he had conceived, of the natural affection of the&s;e &s;avages for their children, was not well founded.</P>
<P>On the 16th, in the morning, &s;everal natives came along &s;ide the Re&s;olution, to trade, as u&s;ual. Then it was that Omai, who was plentifully fur|ni&s;hed with every kind of iron ware, di&s;played his merchandize to the greate&s;t advantage. The &s;avages, inflamed with the richne&s;s of the exhibi|tion, perfectly trembled as they &s;tood, and were ready to board the &s;hip, at the peril of their lives, to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of what appeared to them &s;o va&s;t a trea&s;ure. This, to an European, to whom nails, broken gla&s;s, and &s;hreds of red
<PB N="44" REF="110">
cloth, are of little or no value, may &s;eem exagge|rated; but to tho&s;e who have traver&s;ed the globe, and marked the impetuo&s;ity of the pa&s;&s;ions of &s;avages, when excited to a certain pitch, will ra|ther wonder how they could be re&s;trained, than that they &s;hould be ready to commit any de&s;perate action to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of tho&s;e things which appeared of &s;o much value in their eyes. Omai, though but one degree above the &s;avage whom he de&s;pi&s;ed, yet had cunning enough to take advan|tage of the de&s;ires he had excited, and after pur|cha&s;ing from them every article that &s;uited him, be artfully a&s;ked one party of them if they would &s;ell their boat? to which they readily con&s;ented. Ob&s;erving two promi&s;ing youths on board with another party, he a&s;ked the father if he would not part with his boys. The youths looked with eagerne&s;s at their father, as if they wi&s;hed to fol|low the man that was &s;o rich, and the father, &s;eemingly as willing to part with the lads as they were to go, replied in the affirmative, and the bargain was in&s;tantly &s;truck. Thus, for two hatchets and a few nails, he purcha&s;ed two fine boys, the elde&s;t named Tibura [Taweiharooa], about 15 years old, and the younge&s;t called Gowah [Kokoa], about ten.</P>
<P>On the 17th [Capt. Cook &s;ays the 16th] the Captains of both &s;hips, with other officers and gentlemen, embarked on board the Pinnace, at|tended by a party of marines, well armed, and directed their cour&s;e to the North-We&s;t, round Cannibal-bay for Long I&s;land and Gra&s;s Cove; there they vi&s;ited the &s;pot where the boat's crew belonging to the Adventure, was murdered four years before; but did not find any trace of that horrid ma&s;&s;acre remaining, nor any native from whom they might learn the cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="111">Here our Journali&s;t appears to be ill informed. Capt. Cook here found Pedro, an old friend, who in his former voyages was almo&s;t always with him; who received him on the beech, and &s;hewed him the very &s;pot where the bloody &s;cene was acted. What they could learn from him was, that while our people were &s;itting at dinner, &s;ur|rounded by natives, &s;ome of the latter &s;natched from them &s;ome bread and fi&s;h, for which they were beat. This being re&s;ented, a quarrel en|&s;ued, and two New Zealanders were &s;hot dead with the only two mu&s;kets that were fired; for before they could be loaded again, the natives ru&s;hed upon them, overpowered them by num|bers, and put them all to death. Pedro al&s;o &s;hewed them where the boat lay, about 200 yards from the place where the ma&s;&s;acre was committed, the care of which had been entru&s;ted to a black, &s;ervant to Capt. Furneaux. The Captain was af|terwards told, that the negro was the cau&s;e of the quarrel, which happened thus: One of the na|tives attempting to &s;teal &s;omething out of the boat, the black gave him a &s;evere blow with a &s;tick, and the cries of the fellow being heard by his countrymen, they immediately began the at|tack on our people, who before they could reco|ver their arms from the boat, fell &s;acrifices to the fury of their &s;avage a&s;&s;ailants. Both the&s;e ac|counts, Capt. Cook thinks, might be true, as they perfectly coincide; and he &s;eems clear, that there was no premeditated de&s;ign of murder till the quarrel began; though upon his fir&s;t arrival he was &s;hewn the Chief, <HI>who headed the party that cut our people to pieces,</HI> and who him&s;elf killed Mr. Rowe, the officer who commanded. This fellow's name was Kahoora, whom Capt. Cook was often &s;olicited to kill.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="112">Omai, who could &s;carce make him&s;elf under|&s;tood, nor indeed could he under&s;tand the natives &s;o well as many of the common men who had been frequently here before, yet being a favourite of Capt. Cook, was always preferred when in company, to confer with the natives, and was de&s;ired by him, when he met any of them alone, to que&s;tion them concerning the fray that had happened &s;ome years before, and from what cau&s;e it had taken its ri&s;e; and he was the more de&s;irous to come at the truth, as the natives in general were friendly, and ready to furni&s;h the &s;hips with whatever their country afforded. But from what Omai was able to learn, Capt. Cook received no &s;atisfaction. It &s;hould &s;eem, that in Otaheita there are two dialects &s;poken, as in almo&s;t every other part of the world; one by the prie&s;ts and chiefs, and another by the common people. This was apparent here; for Tupia, who accompanied Mr. Banks to this place, in Capt. Cook's &s;econd voyage round the world, could conver&s;e with the natives fluently, and was in &s;uch e&s;teem with them, that his memory is held in veneration from one end of the i&s;land to the other at this day; Obedee likewi&s;e, who was of the cla&s;s of Areoes, or gen|tlemen, and who accompanied Capt. Cook in his la&s;t voyage from Otaheite to the Thrum I&s;les, the Hebrides, New Zealand, Ea&s;ter I&s;land, and the Marqui&s;&s;es, could conver&s;e with the New Zealanders, though Omai could not; a proof that he was of the inferior cla&s;s in his own country.</P>
<P>While he continued here, he found frequent opportunities to di&s;cover his real character, when from under the watchful eye of his protector and friend. He had grog always at his command, and was &s;ometimes entru&s;ted to give it out, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="47" REF="113">
when any extra quantity was to be delivered by the Captain's orders, for hard &s;ervice, or on days of fe&s;tivity. At tho&s;e times he was clo&s;ely watched, and was never known to exceed; but now, when the Captain was abroad for whole days and nights, and he left in charge of liquors, he &s;et no bounds to his exce&s;s, and would drink till he wallowed like a &s;wine in his own filth. At tho&s;e times he out-acted the &s;avage in every kind of &s;en&s;uality; and when he could no longer act the brute, he would often act the drunken man; &s;torming, roaring, brandi&s;hing his arms, and, by the contor&s;ions of his mouth and face, &s;etting at defiance, after the manner of his country, the whole ho&s;t of his enemies, who were repre&s;ented by the common &s;ailors, with whom, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, he was generally &s;urrounded; and who knew how to practi&s;e upon him, as he endeavoured to do upon the poor Zealanders. He was indeed far from being ill-natured, vindictive, or moro&s;e; but he was &s;ometimes &s;ulky. He was naturally humble, but had grown proud by habit; and it &s;o ill became him, that he was always glad when he could put it off, and could appear among the petty officers with his natural ea&s;e. This was the true character of Omai, who might be &s;aid, per|haps, by accident, to have been rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch of human happine&s;s, only to &s;uffer the oppo&s;ite extreme, by being again reduced to the lowe&s;t order of rational beings.</P>
<P>In the excur&s;ion of the two Captains among the i&s;les, plentiful provi&s;ion was made for the live &s;tock on board, and the long boats of both &s;hips came heavily laden home with gra&s;s for the cattle, and vegetables for the &s;hip's companies, from the gardens of Motuara and Long I&s;land, which were found to remain in a flouri&s;hing, though
<PB N="48" REF="114">
&s;lovenly condition. To the quadrupeds, which the Captains Cook and Furneaux had left to breed in the i&s;land in their former voyages, our Captains added two goats, a male and female with kid; and two pigs, a boar and a &s;ow, tho&s;e that had been left before of this &s;pecies having died almo&s;t as &s;oon as &s;ent on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Wooding, watering, airing the &s;tores, drying and new packing the powder, examining and new baking the damaged bread, forging bolts and new pintles for the rudders, with other nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;i|ne&s;s for repairs of the &s;hip, were continued with|out intermi&s;&s;ion on &s;hore. By the ab&s;ence of &s;o many u&s;eful hands, &s;miths, armourers, gunners, carpenters, rope and &s;ail-makers, with their atten|dants, very few people were left on board to take charge of the &s;hips, nothing being apprehended from the attempts of the natives, who had hitherto behaved with unexampled hone&s;ty, hardly any complaints having been preferred again&s;t any of them for mi&s;behaviour of any kind.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, with &s;carce men enough on board to hand the &s;ails, a &s;torm aro&s;e in the morn|ing of the 19th, which before ten o'clock drove the Di&s;covery from her moorings; and it was owing to Providence, that having run foul of the Re&s;olution, &s;he did not peri&s;h, the &s;urge carrying her off in&s;tantaneou&s;ly with little damage to either &s;hip. All hands on board were thrown into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. No &s;ooner was &s;he clear than we dropped the be&s;t bower anchor, got down the top-gallant yards, &s;truck the top-gallant ma&s;ts, and lowered the yards, got in the cables, and moored with be&s;t bower and &s;heet anchors; and thus fortunately rode out the &s;torm. Mr. Blythe, ma&s;ter of the Re&s;olution, and Mr. Bent|ham our Captain's clerk, &s;eeing the danger the
<PB N="49" REF="115">
&s;hips were in, and at the hazard of their lives at|tempting to get on board in a canoe, were over&s;et, but providentially recovered by the boats from the &s;hips. The gale continuing the whole day, no Indians came to trade.</P>
<P>It &s;hould have been remembered, that, from the time of landing, our brewers began brewing; and the woods affording plenty of &s;pruce, the crews of both &s;hips were &s;upplied with this whole&s;ome beverage during our continuance at New Zealand, and for &s;everal weeks after we were at &s;ea. This liquor was found &s;o &s;alutary, that it &s;eemed to &s;trike at the very root of the &s;curvy, and left not the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of it remaining about any man in the &s;hips.</P>
<P>Indeed, great care was taken to &s;upply the crews daily with plenty of &s;curvy-gra&s;s and wild celery, to boil with their portable &s;oup; and &s;alt-meat was withheld, and fi&s;h &s;ub&s;tituted in its room. This la&s;t the Indians abundantly provided at a trifling expence, and, what is not a little &s;urpri&s;|ing, when our fi&s;hers could catch the lea&s;t, they generally caught the mo&s;t; tho' their implements &s;hewed infinitely le&s;s ingenuity in the con&s;truction, than tho&s;e with which our people were furni&s;hed. It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay by what arts they allured the fi&s;h; but certainly &s;ome means were u&s;ed by them to which we were &s;trangers, nor could they ever be prevailed upon to di&s;cover their &s;ecret.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay in Charlotte Sound, an adven|ture happened, which, though the parties were not of the highe&s;t cla&s;s, may, notwith&s;tanding, be worth relating.</P>
<P>Belonging to the Di&s;covery, there was a youth, with whom a young Zealander girl, about fourteen years of age, fell de&s;perately in love, nor was &s;he wholly indifferent to our adventurer. What time
<PB N="50" REF="116">
he could &s;pare, he generally retired with her, and they &s;pent the day, but oftener the night, in a kind of &s;ilent conver&s;ation, in which, tho' words were wanting, their meaning was perfectly under|&s;tood. Moments fly rapidly on that are &s;pent in mutual endeavours to plea&s;e. She, on her part, had no will but his; and he, in return, was no le&s;s attentive to her's. Minds &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, natu|rally incline to render them&s;elves agreeable. A conformity in manners and dre&s;s become &s;ignifi|cant &s;igns between lovers. Though he appeared amiable in her eyes in the dre&s;s of a &s;tranger, yet he wi&s;hed to render him&s;elf &s;till more &s;o, by or|namenting his per&s;on after the fa&s;hion of her country; accordingly he &s;ubmitted to be tat|towed from head to foot; nor was &s;he le&s;s &s;oli|citous to &s;et her&s;elf off to the be&s;t advantage. She had fine hair, and her chief pride was in the dre&s;s of her head. The pains &s;he took, and the deco|rations &s;he u&s;ed, would have done honour to an European beauty, had not one thing been want|ing to render it &s;till more plea&s;ing. Ghowannahe (that was her name) though young, was not &s;o delicate, but that the traits of her country might be traced in her locks. To remedy this misfor|tune, and to render it le&s;s offen&s;ive, &s;he was fur|ni&s;hed with combs, and taught by her lover how to u&s;e them. After being properly prepared, he would by the hour amu&s;e him&s;elf with forming her hair into ringlets, which flowing carele&s;sly round her neck, with a kind of coronet ri&s;ing from her temples, gave her an air of dignity that added fre&s;h charms to the brilliancy of her eyes. The di&s;ta&s;te ari&s;ing from colour gradually wore off, and the ardent de&s;ire of rendering their &s;entiments more and more intelligible to each other, gave ri&s;e to a new language, con&s;i&s;ting of words, looks,
<PB N="51" REF="117">
ge&s;tures, and inarticulate tones, by which plea&s;ure and pain were more forcibly expre&s;&s;ed than by the mo&s;t refined &s;peech. Having at fir&s;t acquired the art of imparting their pa&s;&s;ions, they very &s;oon im|proved it to the &s;tory of their lives. Love and jealou&s;y directed her enquiries concerning the women of the world from whence he came, wi&s;h|ing at the &s;ame time that he would &s;tay with her, and be a <HI>Kakikoo,</HI> or Chief. He made her to under&s;tand, that the women in his world were all <HI>tatoo</HI> (man-killers) and if he &s;tayed with her &s;he would kill him. She an&s;wered, no; &s;he would <HI>eh-na row,</HI> love him. He &s;aid, her people would kill him. She replied, no; if he did not &s;hoot <HI>them.</HI> He made her to under&s;tand, that nine or ten of the men of his world, had been killed and eaten by her people, tho' they did not &s;hoot them. Her an&s;wer was, that was a great while ago, and the people came from the hills <HI>ro&auml; ro&auml;,</HI> meaning a great way off. This excited his curio&s;ity to know if any of her relations were among the murderers: &s;he &s;ighed, and appeared much af|fected when he a&s;ked her that que&s;tion. He a&s;ked her if &s;he was at the fea&s;t when they broiled and eat the men? &s;he wept, and looking wi&s;hfully at him, hung down her head. He became &s;till more pre&s;&s;ing as &s;he grew more re&s;erved. He tried every winning way that love and curio&s;ity &s;ugge&s;ted, to learn from her what he found &s;he knew, and what &s;he &s;eemed &s;o determined to con|ceal. But &s;he artfully evaded all his que&s;tions. He a&s;ked her, why &s;he was &s;o re&s;erved? She pre|tended not to under&s;tand him. He repeated the &s;ame que&s;tion, and why &s;he kept him in the dark, at the &s;ame time clo&s;ing his eyes and keeping them &s;hut. She continued to weep, but made him no an&s;wer. Finding all his per&s;ua&s;ions inef|fectual,
<PB N="52" REF="118">
he turned from her, &s;eemingly in anger, and threatened to leave her. She caught him round the neck in violent agitation. He a&s;ked her what &s;he meant, and why &s;he wept? She &s;aid, they would kill her if &s;he told. He &s;aid, they &s;hould not know it. Then He would hate her, &s;he &s;aid. He an&s;wered, no; but love her more and more, pre&s;&s;ing her to his bo&s;om at the &s;ame time. She grew more compo&s;ed, and &s;aid &s;he would tell him all &s;he knew. She then made him under&s;tand, that one Gooboa [Kahoora, ac|cording to Capt. Cook] a bad man, who had been often at the &s;hip, and had &s;tolen many things; when he came to know that it was preparing to depart, went up into the hill country, to the hip|pah, and invited the warriors to come down and kill the &s;trangers. They at fir&s;t refu&s;ed, &s;aying, the &s;trangers were &s;tronger than they, and would kill them with their <HI>pow pow,</HI> or fire-arms; he told them, they need not fear; for he knew where they mu&s;t come before they departed, in order to get gra&s;s for their <HI>goury,</HI> or cattle, and that on &s;uch occa&s;ions they left their <HI>pow pow</HI> behind them in the &s;hip, or carele&s;sly about the ground, while they were at work. They &s;aid, they were no enemies, but friends, and they mu&s;t not kill men with whom they were in friend&s;hip. Kahoora &s;aid, they were vile enemies and wicked men, and complained of their chaining him and beating him, and &s;hewed them the marks and brui&s;es he had received at the &s;hip; and told them be&s;ides how they might &s;ilence their <HI>pow pow,</HI> by only throwing water over them, and then they could not hurt them. Kahoora undertook to conduct them in &s;afety to the place where the &s;trangers were to come, and &s;hewed them where they might conceal them&s;elves till he &s;hould come
<PB N="53" REF="119">
and gave them notice, which he did. And when the men were bu&s;y about getting gra&s;s, and not thinking any harm, the warriors ru&s;hed out upon them, and killed them with their patapatows, and then divided their bodies among them.</P>
<P>[This Kahoora was &s;o bad a man, that Capt. Cook was often &s;olicited to kill him by the natives; and Omai, having introduced him into the Cap|tain's cabin for that purpo&s;e, &s;aying, There is Kahoora, kill him! as &s;oon as he had &s;aid this, retired. He had often a&s;ked the Captain's per|mi&s;&s;ion to kill him him&s;elf; but when it was in his power &s;o to do, he in&s;tantly got out of the way. A &s;hort time after, &s;ays Capt. Cook, he returned, and &s;eeing the Chief unhurt, he expo&s;|tulated with me very earne&s;tly, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline">"You tell me, if a man kills another in England, he is hanged for it: This man has killed ten, and yet you would not kill him, tho' many of his country|men de&s;ire it, and it would be very good."</Q> The Captain de&s;ired Omai to a&s;k the Chief, why he killed Capt. Furneaux's people. At this que&s;tion he hung down his head, and looked like one caught in a trap, and expected in&s;tant death; but he was no &s;ooner a&s;&s;ured of his &s;afety, than he became chearful. He did not, however, &s;eem willing to an&s;wer the que&s;tion, till he was again and again a&s;&s;ured that he &s;hould not be hurt, and then he &s;aid, that one of his countrymen having brought a &s;tone hatchet to barter, the man to whom it was offered, took it, and would neither pay for it, nor give it him back; on which the owner &s;natched up the bread as an equivalent, and then the quarrel began. The&s;e &s;tories are by no means &s;o probable as that told by the girl, who makes the ma&s;&s;acre the premeditated de&s;ign of Kahoora. El&s;e why &s;uch a number of the &s;avages together

in an unfrequented place, and all arm'd too, had they not come with an ill de&s;ign.] But to proceed with our narrative.</P>
<P>Ghowannahe added, that there were women as well as men concerned, and that the women made the fires, while the warriors cut the dead men in pieces; that they did not eat them all at once, but only their hearts and livers; that the warriors had the heads, which were e&s;teemed the be&s;t, and the re&s;t of the fle&s;h was di&s;tributed among the crowd. Having by various que&s;tions in the cour&s;e of &s;e|veral days extorted this relation, of which, he &s;aid, he had no rea&s;on to doubt the truth, he forbore to a&s;k her what part her relations and her&s;elf bore in this tragedy, as there was rea&s;on to believe they were all equally concerned. He was, however, very &s;olicitous to learn, if any &s;uch plot was now in agitation again&s;t the people that might be &s;ent upon the &s;ame &s;ervice, to Gra&s;s Cove, or any other convenient place. Her an&s;wer was, no; the warriors were afraid, at fir&s;t, that the &s;hips were come to revenge the death of their friends, and that was the rea&s;on why &s;he was for|bidden to &s;peak of killing the &s;trangers, or to own any knowledge of it, if &s;he were a&s;ked about any &s;uch thing. She &s;aid &s;he was but a child, not 9 years old; but &s;he remembered the talk of it, as a gallant action or great atchievement, and that they made &s;ongs in prai&s;e of it.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of his conver&s;ation with this girl, who &s;eemed rather of the better &s;ort, he learned many things concerning the natural temper of the natives, that had e&s;caped the penetration of for|mer Voyagers, and likewi&s;e with re&s;pect to their dome&s;tic policy. She &s;aid, the people of T'Avi-Poenammoo, or the Southern divi&s;ion of the i&s;land, were a fierce bloody people, and had a
<PB N="55" REF="121">
natural hatred to the people of Ea-hei-no-mauwe, and killed them when he found them at any time in their country; but that the people of Ea-hei-no-mauwe were a good people, and were friendly to one another, but never &s;uffered any of the people of T'Avi-Poenammoo to &s;ettle among them, becau&s;e they were enemies; that they &s;ometimes employed them to work for them; but that the two nations, the people on the North part of the Sound, and tho&s;e on the South, were ever at war, and eat one another. She added, that the people of either country, when they fought, never eat one another; (&s;o that it &s;hould &s;eem, that habitual antipathy has a great &s;hare in the tendency of the&s;e &s;avages to become men-eaters.) With re&s;pect to their dome&s;tic policy, &s;he &s;aid, the fathers had the &s;ole care of the boys as &s;oon as they could walk, and that the girls were left wholly at the mother's di&s;po&s;al. She &s;aid, it was a crime for a mother to correct her &s;on, after he was once taken under the protection of the father; and that it was always re&s;ented by the mother, if the father interfered in the management of the daughters. She &s;aid, the boys from their in|fancy were trained to war, and both boys and girls were taught the art of fi&s;hing, to weave their nets, and make their hooks and lines; that their canoes came from a far country, and that they got them in exchange for cloth, which was chiefly manufactured by the women; that their arms and working tools de&s;cended from father to &s;on, and that tho&s;e that were taken in battle &s;upplied the ri&s;ing generation; that they had no Kings among them, but that they had men who conver&s;ed with the dead, who were held in great veneration, and con&s;ulted before the people went to the wars; that they were the men who addre&s;&s;ed &s;trangers that

a me upon the coa&s;t, fir&s;t in the language of peace, at the fir&s;t time denouncing vengeance again&s;t them, if they came with any ho&s;tile de|&s;ign; that the per&s;ons of the&s;e men were held &s;acred, and never killed in the wars, which ever &s;ide prevailed; that when the warriors of either nation made pri&s;oners, they were never of the meaner &s;ort, but of &s;ome Chief, whom they af|terwards killed and eat; but that to the common &s;ort they never gave quarter; that they &s;ometimes tortured an enemy, if they found him &s;ingly lurk|ing in the woods, looking upon him as one who came upon no good de&s;ign; but never otherwi&s;e; that they lived chiefly upon fi&s;h, which were caught in the Sound in abundance, during the &s;ummer, and were dried and pre&s;erved for the winter; but that in very &s;evere weather they re|tired to the North.</P>
<P>The account given by Mr. Ander&s;on, Surgeon and Naturali&s;t to the Re&s;olution, corre&s;ponds in every re&s;pect with the information which our Journali&s;t received from his favourite girl. The children, &s;ays Mr. Ander&s;on, are initiated at an early age, into all the practices, good or bad, of their fathers; &s;o that you find a boy or girl nine or ten years old, able to perform all the motions, and to imitate the frightful ge&s;tures which the more aged u&s;e to in&s;pire their enemies with terror, keeping the &s;tricte&s;t time in their &s;ong. They likewi&s;e &s;ing with &s;ome degree of melody the tra|ditions of their forefathers, their actions in war, and other indifferent &s;ubjects, of all which they are immoderately fond, and &s;pend much of their time in the&s;e amu&s;ements, and playing on a &s;ort of flute.</P>
<P>No people can have a quicker &s;en&s;e of injury, nor any more ready to re&s;ent it; but this, Mr.
<PB N="57" REF="123">
Ander&s;on thinks, may be looked upon as the ef|fect rather of a &s;avage di&s;po&s;ition, than of genuine bravery. Their public contentions are frequent, or rather perpetual; and it appears, from their number of weapons and their dexterity in u&s;ing them, that war is their principal profe&s;&s;ion. Be|fore they begin the on&s;et, they join in a war &s;ong, to which they all keep the exacte&s;t time, and &s;oon rai&s;e their pa&s;&s;ion to a degree of fury, attended with the mo&s;t horrid di&s;tortions of their eyes, mouth, and tongues, to &s;trike terror into their enemies, which, to tho&s;e who have not been ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;uch a practice, makes them appear more like daemons than men, and would almo&s;t chill the bolde&s;t with fear. To this &s;ucceeds a circum&s;tance almo&s;t foretold in their fierce de|meanour, horrid, cruel, and di&s;graceful to human nature, which is, cutting in pieces, even before being perfectly dead, the bodies of their enemies, and, after dre&s;&s;ing them on a fire, devouring the fle&s;h, not only without reluctance, but with pe|culiar &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked, if they ever eat the bodies of their friends, they &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed at the que&s;tion, and expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome abhorrence at the idea. No people on earth appear to lament the lo&s;s of friends with more tender concern than the New Zealanders; they bewail them with the mo&s;t dole|ful cries, tearing their hair, and cutting their faces, till they mingle their blood with their tears.</P>
<P>They chiefly live by fi&s;hing; and the only furniture of their hou&s;es are buckets, and bags, wherein they keep their fi&s;hing-hooks; they are &s;eldom &s;tationary, but remove from place to place; and it is a&s;toni&s;hing with what facility they build their hou&s;es. Capt. Cook was pre&s;ent while they
<PB N="58" REF="124">
built a village. The moment the canoes reached the &s;hore, the men leapt out, and at once took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a piece of ground by tearing up the plants and &s;hrubs, and &s;ticking up &s;ome part of the framing of a hut. They then returned to their canoes, and &s;ecured their weapons, by placing them &s;o as they could reach them in an in&s;tant. They then began to arrange the mate|rials, &s;ome of which they brought with them, the re&s;t they got upon the &s;pot, and, while the men were thus employed, the women were not idle; &s;ome were placed to watch the canoes, others to &s;ecure the provi&s;ions, and others to find fuel to dre&s;s their food. Thus, in a few hours, they had hou&s;es to &s;leep in, and fire to dre&s;s their &s;uppers.</P>
<P>They generally cho&s;e to be near the tents, and took up their abode clo&s;e to them. The &s;eamen, Capt. Cook &s;ays, had in general taken a di&s;like to tho&s;e people, and &s;eldom would a&s;&s;ociate with them; and indeed there was good rea&s;on. They were both loath&s;ome in their per&s;ons and diet: Train oil was a mo&s;t delicious fea&s;t to them; the &s;courings of the lamps, and even the remnants of the wicks, were voraciou&s;ly devoured by them. When the &s;ailors were melting their &s;eal blubber, the &s;kimmings of the pots, and the dregs of the ca&s;ks, were frequently fought for by the bye-&s;tanders.</P>
<P>Though they are in an eternal &s;tate of warfare among them&s;elves, yet if a &s;tranger comes among them, of whom they have no &s;u&s;picion, they are received and kindly entertained, as long as they have any bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;act, but no longer. Thus it is that a trade is carried on among them, by way of exchange of one thing for another. The mo&s;t precious material is green talc, of the
<PB N="59" REF="125" MS="y">
origin of which they have many &s;uper&s;titious &s;to|ries; one that it was originally a fi&s;h, and the good &s;pirit, when he is plea&s;ed, forms it into a &s;tone. It is only to be found in one i&s;le. They have certainly a notion of rewards and puni&s;h|ments, and a future &s;tate; they believe that the &s;oul of the Chief who is killed in war, and is eaten by the enemy, is doomed to everla&s;ting fire; while the &s;oul of the Chief who conquers in bat|tle, and dies a natural death, a&s;cends among the good &s;pirits, who have the power of be&s;towing victory as the reward of valour. It does not ap|pear, however, that they have any &s;ettled &s;y&s;tem of religion; they have no <HI>morai's,</HI> nor any cere|monies at the interment of their departed friends; but they frequently carve miniature figures in &s;tone, which they ornament with eyes of pearl, and hang about their necks, as memorials of tho&s;e who were deare&s;t to them while they lived. They have, too, their days of ab&s;tinence, and their modes of &s;upplicating the good &s;pirit, and deprecating the evil one, but they could not be comprehended. Madan's &s;y&s;tem of marriage was di&s;coverable among them; whoever fir&s;t took a virgin, kept to her for life, and there were many who ap|peared to have more women than one dependent on them: parental affection was characteri&s;tic among them; and there appeared no other &s;ub|ordination except that which originated from filial duty. Their Chiefs &s;eemed all de&s;cendants from the &s;ame &s;tock, branched out like the ramifications of a tree from one root, which, united, con&s;tituted one tribe.</P>
<P>Mr. Ander&s;on in the natural hi&s;tory of this country is very copious. The &s;oil, he &s;ays, is be&s;t indicated by the luxuriant growth of its produc|tions. The hills, with &s;ome exceptions near the

&s;hores, are one continued fore&s;t of lofty trees, flouri&s;hing beyond conception. The happy tem|perature of the climate contributes not a little to this uncommon &s;trength of vegetation. There are no marks of deva&s;tation by hurricanes, nor of torrents ru&s;hing from the mountains by exce&s;&s;ive rains. The country is in general mountainous, and the vallies watered by brooks and rivulets; and as it is by nature ill adapted for improve|ment by the plough, there does not appear the lea&s;t trace of cultivation.</P>
<P>The large trees that cover the hills are chiefly of two &s;orts; one not unlike in growth to the Northern firs; the other like our maple; both &s;orts were cut for fuel, being found too heavy for ma&s;ts and yards. There were likewi&s;e a &s;pecies of <HI>Philadelphus,</HI> the leaves of which were drank for tea, and was an excellent &s;ub&s;titute for the Orien|tal &s;ort.</P>
<P>Among the plants, wild celery, and a &s;ort of &s;curvy-gra&s;s were found the mo&s;t &s;alutary; a fedge-like plant, of which the natives make their garments, was likewi&s;e noticed by Mr. Ander&s;on, and much commended: of all the&s;e and many more, we brought home the &s;eeds.</P>
<P>Of the birds, there was a tolerable &s;tock, but rather &s;hy; among them he mentions a mu&s;ical bird, when by it&s;elf, was &s;ufficient to fill the woods with melody: though &s;mall, it was enchanting. Another curious bird, Mr. Ander&s;on mentions, with a long tail, which on approaching it, &s;preads it like a fan.</P>
<P>Among other birds they killed were two or three rails, as large as common fowls, but no other game, one &s;ingle &s;nipe excepted.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h in the Sound were of various kinds, many of them excellent, and furni&s;hed by the
<PB N="61" REF="129">
natives in great abundance; a fi&s;h called by the natives <HI>magge,</HI> and by the &s;eamen <HI>&s;ea-breams</HI>; &s;mall &s;almons and cole-fi&s;h were &s;uperior to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Shell-fi&s;h about the rocks were in &s;uch plenty, that the natives &s;eem in a great mea&s;ure to live upon them when the weather is &s;uch that they cannot get out to &s;ea. They have mu&s;cles a foot long, cray-fi&s;h, cockles, &s;mall oy&s;ters, and a va|riety of other rock-fi&s;h, periwincles and crabs.</P>
<P>In&s;ects are not numerous, but &s;ome there are that were very trouble&s;ome, as &s;corpion-flies and &s;and-flies, as venomous as mu&s;quitoes.</P>
<P>Among the reptiles a kind of lizard is men|tioned, eight feet in length, and as big round as a man's body; they burrow in the ground, and, as one of the Zealand youths that embarked with Omai affirmed, &s;ometimes &s;eize and devour men.</P>
<P>There were no traces of any four-footed animal to be &s;een, rats and a kind of fox-dogs excepted, on which the prie&s;ts and the chiefs &s;ometimes, but &s;eldom, fea&s;ted. It is not a little remark|able, that neither metal nor mineral were di&s;|coverable on the i&s;land, the green ja&s;per only excepted.</P>
<P>The Zealanders, in general, do not exceed the common &s;tature of Europeans; &s;ome, indeed, are remarkable for their large bones and mu&s;cular &s;trength, but of the&s;e few were &s;een; their faces are round, their eyes full, their lips plump, and their no&s;es, as the phra&s;e is, bottled. Mr. An|der&s;on does not remember to have &s;een the true aqualine no&s;e among them; though, if we re|member right, Mr. Parkin&s;on's chief is an ex|ception. Their teeth were commonly large, white, and well &s;et; their hair black and lank, and their per&s;ons, <HI>altogether,</HI> tolerably proportioned, but
<PB N="62" REF="130">
few graceful or &s;trikingly well-made. The wo|men, in general, are ordinary and forbidding. The dre&s;s of both &s;exes is the &s;ame, con&s;i&s;ting of a kind of cloth made of &s;ilky flax, which nature has provided for them; and which they have im|proved by bleaching, dying, and knotting. They bring two corners of this cloth over their &s;houl|ders, and fa&s;ten it on the brea&s;t and round their wai&s;t with a girdle: &s;ome ornament the&s;e with the fur of dog-&s;kin, and others with the fea|thers of birds wrought into the cloth as it is made. For cloaks they u&s;e a kind of matting, which they throw loo&s;ely over them, &s;o as to co|ver them when they &s;it, from head to foot; and when &s;o covered, it is not ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h them from grey &s;tones; by which means they form ambu&s;hes in war, and fall upon the enemy by &s;urprize. Their colour is naturally a very dark-brown, but they rather affect to make it appear black; their beards grow long: but they &s;have to make way for punctuating their faces, which, whether a mark of di&s;tinction, or only intended for ornament, mu&s;t be a painful and tedious ope|ration.</P>
<P>As mechanics they certainly excel; their ca|noes are ma&s;ter-pieces of mechanical labour, and their cordage is equal to that of Europe; their lines, their nets, their fi&s;hing-tackle, and, in &s;hort, every thing u&s;eful in common life is fa|bricated and fini&s;hed to admiration; their carv|ing, con&s;idering their tools, they have to work with, is beyond conception elegant."</P>
<P>On the 23d, in the morning, the old Indian who had harangued the &s;hip, when we ap|proached the &s;hore, came on board the Di&s;covery, and pre&s;ented the Captain with a compleat &s;tand of their arms, and &s;ome very fine fi&s;h, which were
<PB N="63" REF="131">
kindly received; and, in return, the Captain gave him a bra&s;s pata-patow, made exactly in their manner, on which were engraven his Ma|je&s;ty's name and arms, the names of the &s;hips, the date of their departure from England, and the bu&s;ine&s;s they were &s;ent upon; he gave him like|wi&s;e a hatchet, a few nails, a knife, and &s;ome gla&s;s ornaments, which he highly prized, tho' of &s;mall value. This day the wood-cutters lo&s;t a wood-ax, which one of the natives dexterou&s;ly carried off, without being di&s;covered. In the evening they brought a man bound, whom they offered to &s;ell; but their offer being rejected, they carried him back, and in the night, a mo&s;t horrid yelling was heard in the woods, which excited the cu|rio&s;ity of the gentlemen on board our &s;hip, to examine into the cau&s;e. The cutter was ordered to be manned, a party of marines were armed to be put on board, and the Captain, with proper attendants, directed their cour&s;e to the we&s;t &s;ide of the bay, where they &s;aw &s;everal fires ju&s;t light|ed, and where they hoped to have &s;urprized the natives, before they had put their poor captive to death; but, in this hope they were di&s;ap|pointed, perhaps he was re&s;erved for a better fate. The &s;avages in an in&s;tant di&s;appeared, and left no trace behind them of any &s;laughter having been committed.</P>
<P>About four in the morning, the tents were &s;truck, and orders delivered out for &s;ailing.</P>
<P>Next day, Feb. 24th, the Indians flocked in great numbers about the &s;hip, bringing with them a plentiful &s;upply of fi&s;h, and whatever el&s;e they thought marketable among the &s;ailors.</P>
<P>Though the natives appeared friendly during our &s;tay, it was judged proper to keep the time of our departure &s;ecret till all things were on
<PB N="64" REF="132">
board, and we were in readine&s;s to &s;ail. This precaution Capt. Cook thought the more nece&s;|&s;ary, from what he had ju&s;t heard of the treach|ery of the &s;avages. By not allowing them to concert any new plot, he effectually &s;ecured our foraging parties from the danger of a &s;urprize; and by thus &s;uddenly giving orders to &s;ail, he prevented our own men from rambling after the women when their bu&s;ine&s;s was done, which, tho' not <HI>over-fond</HI> of Zealanders, they never failed to do when in their power. The foraging parties here meant are tho&s;e who were &s;ent to the coves, at the di&s;tance, perhaps, of &s;ix or &s;even leagues from the &s;hips, to cut gra&s;s for the live &s;tock, and to gather herbs to boil with the portable &s;oup for the men; and tho&s;e al&s;o who were &s;tationed in the woods to get &s;pruce to brew into beer for their pre&s;er|vation from the &s;curvy, again&s;t which that li|quor, as has already been ob&s;erved, was found a mo&s;t powerful antidote. [The tree, the leaves and berries of which they made their &s;pruce, was as large, according to Mr. Ander&s;on, as our large&s;t firs; but their tops more like the yew]. Of gra&s;s and herbs an immen&s;e quantity was brought on board, and of &s;pruce as much as &s;erved the crews for drink near thirty days, during which time no grog was delivered out. The parties or|dered upon the&s;e &s;ervices went always well arm|ed and guarded by marines, though Capt. Cook him&s;elf entertained very high notions of the ho|nour as well as bravery of the New Zealanders.</P>
<P>It was about &s;even in the morning when the &s;hips cleared the bay, and about eleven, when they entered the mouth of Cook's Streights, where they ca&s;t anchor; and Capt. Clerke, and Mr. Burney, his fir&s;t Lieutenant, went on board the Re&s;olution, to dine with Capt. Cook. Here
<PB N="65" REF="133">
the friends of the two Zealander youths, whom Omai had purcha&s;ed, came to take their la&s;t leave of them, and expre&s;&s;ed, very affectingly, their grief at parting, though the boys were as yet in pretty good &s;pirits. Some pre&s;ents were made by Omai to the parents, and they departed, &s;eemingly with great reluctance.</P>
<P>[On the 25th, Kahoora with his whole family came on board the Re&s;olution, without the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions of danger, or fear for his life; &s;uch confidence had Capt. Cook's behaviour in&s;pired among the New Zealanders, that they look|ed upon his word as &s;acred, he now an&s;wered all the que&s;tions that were put to him without re&s;erve. Mr. Burney, who, the next day after the ma&s;&s;acre, was &s;ent with an armed party to Gra&s;s Cove, fired &s;everal vollies among the crowds of cannibals a&s;&s;embled about the dete&s;table ban|quet, and it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that many of them had felt the effects of his ju&s;t re&s;entment; but Kahoora declared, that not a &s;ingle per&s;on was hurt.]</P>
<P>On the 27th, both &s;hips came to &s;ail, and on the 28th, cleared the land; lat. 41.36. long. 175. E.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of March, a &s;torm came on, but as the wind was fair, we got down the top gal|lant-yards, clo&s;e-reefed the top-&s;ails, and pur|&s;ued our cour&s;e E. by N. About four in the afternoon it cleared up, we &s;poke with the Re|&s;olution, and all well, except the two New Zealanders, who, notwith&s;tanding their con&s;tant re&s;idence on the margin of the main ocean, and their employment of fi&s;hing near the &s;hores from their infancy, yet, when they came to leave the land, and &s;eeing nothing but foaming billows all
<PB N="66" REF="134">
round them, their hearts failed them; they now began to pine, and refu&s;ed to eat.</P>
<P>On the 3d, the wind continuing fair, and the breeze moderate, Capt. Clerke, with Mr. Burney, went on board the Re&s;olution, to dine with Capt. Cook. When the New Zealanders were told there was a boat come on board, whatever their apprehen&s;ions then were, it was not ea&s;y to di&s;|cover; but they ran and hid them&s;elves, and &s;eemed to be in a great panic. It did not appear that their fear took its ri&s;e from the thoughts of being carried back, becau&s;e when the gentle|men were coming away, they wanted to come with them. It &s;hould rather &s;eem, therefore, that they were apprehen&s;ive of &s;ome de&s;ign upon their lives, as in their country a con&s;ultation among the chiefs always precedes a determined murder. This was in part confirmed by their behaviour afterwards. This day we were in lat. 42.31. S. long. 182.30. E. Nothing remark|able till</P>
<P>The 7th, when a great &s;well from the South|ward gave notice of an approaching &s;torm. Al|batro&s;&s;es, men of war birds, flying fi&s;h, dol|phins and &s;harks had played about the &s;hips for &s;everal days, and &s;ome of our gentlemen had &s;hot albatro&s;&s;es that mea&s;ured eleven feet from tip to tip; and this day a large &s;hark was caught, mo&s;t of which was eaten by the &s;hip's company; though they had not yet lo&s;t the reli&s;h of the New Zealand fi&s;h, nor were their &s;tores quite exhau&s;ted, mo&s;t of the &s;ailors having purcha&s;ed quantities to &s;alt, which were e&s;teemed excel|lent.

<P>On the 8th, the &s;torm that was fore&s;een came on, accompanied with thunder, lightning and
<PB N="67" REF="135">
rain. The &s;ea ro&s;e mountains high, and the wind increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take in almo&s;t all our &s;ails with the utmo&s;t expedition, and to &s;cud it under double reefed top-tails. We &s;till kept our cour&s;e, &s;teer|ing N. E. by E.

<P>On the 11th, it began to blow very hard in the morning, and before we could hand the top-gal|lant &s;ails, it carried away the main top-gallant yard; about two in the afternoon it became fine, but attended with a great &s;well from the South|ward. Lat. ob&s;. 39.26. long. 195.35.</P>
<P>On the 14th, a fine breeze, cour&s;e N. E. by N. We were now advancing bri&s;kly at the rate of 7 and 8 knots an hour, when all on a &s;udden the wind &s;hifted to the South-ea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 15th it blew a hurricane, attended with rain and a high &s;ea, which breaking over our bows, cleared the decks of every thing that was not firmly &s;ecured. It carried away our main top-gallant-yard in the &s;lings, and &s;plit our fore-top-ma&s;t-&s;tay-&s;ail in a thou&s;and &s;hreds. At night we &s;hifted our cour&s;e, and &s;tood N. by E. &frac12; E. There were &s;ome on board who di&s;approved of the cour&s;e we had &s;teered from the beginning, fore&s;eeing, that by going &s;o fa&s;t to the North|ward, we &s;hould fall too &s;uddenly into the trade|winds, e&s;pecially if we &s;hould be met by an Ea&s;terly wind before we approached the Tropic. Among the &s;eamen on board a king's &s;hip, there
<PB N="68" REF="136">
are always &s;ome expert navigators, who&s;e judg|ment, ripened by experience, is much to be de|pended upon; but the misfortune is, that the&s;e men are never con&s;ulted, nor do they even dare &s;o much as to whi&s;per their opinion to their &s;u|perior officer. Like game&s;ters &s;tanding by, they can &s;ee the errors of the game, but mu&s;t not point them out till the game is over. This was the real ca&s;e on board the Di&s;covery, &s;ome of who&s;e people did not &s;cruple to foretel what would happen the moment we left the 39th de|gree of Southern latitude, while we were yet only in the 109th degree of Ea&s;tern longitude. They did not &s;cruple to &s;ay among them&s;elves, that in&s;tead of 22 degrees &s;hort of the longitude of Otaheite, (which lies in 212&deg; E. nearly) be|fore we altered our latitude to the North, we ought to have &s;tretched at lea&s;t 12 degrees far|ther Ea&s;tward, being then certain, that how far &s;oever we might be to the Ea&s;tward of our in|tended port, when we came to cro&s;s the Tropic we &s;hould be &s;ure of a fair wind to carry us to it. Lat. this day ob&s;. 34.6. long. 198.28.</P>
<P>[This remark now appears in its full force, Capt. Cook's words are, <Q REND="inline">"the hopes of the wind coming more Southerly, or of meeting with it from the We&s;tward, a little without the Tropics, encouraged me to continue this cour&s;e. Indeed it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould run all ri&s;ks,"</Q> &amp;c.]</P>
<P>On the 18th, having continued our cour&s;e N. N. E. for the la&s;t twenty-four hours, we found our&s;elves in lat. 33 deg. 8 min. by ob&s;ervation, and in long. 200.36. E. that is more than 12 degrees to the We&s;tward of Otaheite. Here we &s;aw &s;ea-weed in abundance, and by a large tree floating by us, we judged we could not be far
<PB N="69" REF="137">
from land, but found none. The tree appeared to be about thirty feet long, and of a con&s;iderable girt, and by its fre&s;hne&s;s, &s;eemed not to have been long in the water.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t, when, in the latitude of 28 degrees South, we &s;aw a large whale at a little di&s;tance; a &s;ight &s;eldom &s;een in &s;o low a latitude in the northern hemi&s;phere. This day our beer, which had been periodically brewed from the &s;pruce brought from New Zealand, was all exhau&s;ted, and grog &s;erved out in its &s;tead. Hitherto not a man was ill on board the Di&s;covery, nor any other alteration made in their allowance. It was the number of live &s;tock on board the Re&s;olu|tion, that occa&s;ioned the di&s;tre&s;s for water, from which the Di&s;covery was in a manner exempt, having but few on board, more than were ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;hip's u&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 22d, the heavie&s;t rain began to pour down, that any man on board had ever known. It fell in &s;heets, and as the wind increa&s;ed, the men in handling the &s;ails, were in the utmo&s;t danger of being wa&s;hed off the yards. It continued for &s;ix hours ince&s;&s;antly. It came, however, mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable for the Re&s;olution, where the number of live &s;tock, hor&s;es, cows, goats, and &s;heep had exhau&s;ted a large proportion of their fre&s;h wa|ter, and we were yet at a great di&s;tance from our de&s;tined port. Here the wind began to veer to the Ea&s;t, as we approached the Tropic. This was apprehended by many, who finding our longitude not to increa&s;e in proportion as our latitude de|crea&s;ed, began to &s;u&s;pect that we &s;hould not be able to make Otaheite this run.

<P>On the 23d, the weather continuing, we be|gan to be accompanied by our tropical compa|nions,

<P>On the 25th our latitude was decrea&s;ed to 24 deg. 24 min. without our longitude being in|crea&s;ed one &s;ingle degree. The wind E. S. E. and our cour&s;e N. E. by N. we made but little way to the Ea&s;tward. But the weather continu|ing fair, Capt. Clerke and Mr. Burney went on board the Re&s;olution, to dine with Capt. Cook, and when they returned, brought the &s;orrowful news of the alarming &s;ituation of the Re&s;olution for want of provi&s;ions and water for the live &s;tock; that they were obliged to kill a great part of their &s;heep, hogs and goats for the u&s;e of the crew, not having a &s;ufficient quantity of food and wa|ter to keep them alive; that the hor&s;es and cows were mere &s;keletons, being reduced to the &s;canty portion of four pounds of hay, and &s;ix quarts of water for twenty-four hours; and the men put to the allowance of two quarts of water, for the &s;ame &s;pace of time: that the wind &s;till continuing foul, all thoughts of reaching Otaheite were laid a&s;ide, and that the i&s;les of Am&s;terdam and Rot|terdam were now our only re&s;ource. [The above facts and important ob&s;ervations are omitted by Capt. Cook; which, notwith&s;tanding, are ill im|plied, and &s;hews not only the accuracy of our journali&s;t, but the &s;uperiority of his judgment in fore&s;eeing and foretelling what would be the i&s;&s;ue of &s;uch a <HI>de&s;perate</HI> cour&s;e.] Nothing remark|able till</P>

that it became nece&s;&s;ary for us to hand our &s;ails, one after another, till our double-reefed top-&s;ails were all that were abroad.

<P>On the 28th, the tempe&s;tuous weather &s;till con|tinuing, we altered our cour&s;e to the North. The wind for the la&s;t twenty-four hours, blowing mo&s;t|ly from the S. E. We, this day, cro&s;&s;ed the Southern Tropic: [on the 27th, according to Capt. Cook,] when the weather cleared up, and we were &s;aluted with a fine breeze, and attended by numerous &s;hoals of flying fi&s;h, bonitos, dol|phins, &s;harks, and whole flocks of Tropical &s;ea-fowl, which abound near the i&s;lands in the low latitudes, but are &s;eldom &s;een in the deep Pacific Sea.</P>
<P>On the 29th, about ten in the morning, the &s;ky being clear, and the weather moderate, the man at the ma&s;t-head called out, Land, bearing N. E. di&s;tant about &s;even or eight leagues. We made the &s;ignal, which was &s;oon an&s;wered by the Re&s;olution. About 12, the weather began to alter, and to blow in gu&s;ts from the land. At four in the afternoon tacked &s;hip, and &s;tood in for the land. Saw no &s;ign of inhabitants while day-light remained, but in the night ob|&s;erved &s;everal fires. Lat. 22.17. long. 201.25.</P>
<P>On the 30th, &s;aw &s;everal canoes approaching the &s;hips, and many inhabitants on the beach, &s;eemingly in arms to oppo&s;e our landing. About ten, the boats were hoi&s;ted out and manned, in order to reconnoitre the &s;hore, and &s;ound for an|chorage, who, to our great di&s;appointment, re|turned, without having &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="141">Two of the canoes came within call, having three per&s;ons in each canoe; but none of them could be prevailed upon to come on board. Our Captain &s;hewed many articles of European manufacture to excite their curio&s;ity, but they &s;eemed to &s;et little value on any thing, except New Zealand cloth; of which he threw a piece over-board, and they came and dived for it; but they had no &s;ooner recovered it, than they paddled off as fa&s;t as they could, without offering any thing in return. In the mean time the boats were &s;urrounded by multitudes from the &s;hore, who came, &s;ome in canoes, and &s;ome &s;wimming; they even attempted to board the boats by force, and &s;everal fa&s;tened round them with their teeth. Thus circum&s;tanced, and in danger of being &s;unk, they cho&s;e rather to re|turn to the &s;hips, than hazard their own &s;afety; or, to &s;ecure them&s;elves, deprive any of the innocent people of life; an injunction that was frequently repeated by Capt. Cook, during the voyage, and which was the more nece&s;&s;ary, as the common &s;ailors were very apt to forget, that the life of an Indian was of any account. About noon, the Re&s;olution, being in much di&s;tre&s;s for water, though &s;omewhat relieved by the rains which had fallen, Capt. Cook ordered the cutter to be manned, and went in it him&s;elf, to talk with the natives, and to examine the coa&s;t; but, after a fruitle&s;s &s;earch, was forced to return, the &s;urf being &s;uch as rendered the watering of the &s;hips from the &s;hore an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility. While he lay too, he had &s;ome friendly conver|&s;ation with the natives, and &s;ome pre&s;ents pa&s;&s;ed between them; but nothing that an&s;wered the purpo&s;es of &s;upplying the &s;hips, or refre&s;hing the crews. One of the natives to whom a
<PB N="73" REF="142">
knife was given, in&s;tantly run it through his ear, and &s;wam to &s;hore though the &s;urf ro&s;e to an a&s;to|ni&s;hing height. [This per&s;on, Capt. Cook &s;ays, had two poli&s;hed pearl-&s;hells, and a bunch of hu|man hair loo&s;ely twi&s;ted, hanging about his neck.] Great numbers came round to the beech, over-again&s;t which the Captain lay, waving green branches in token of peace.</P>
<P>This i&s;land, which the natives called Mangya, or Mangeea, and the name of their chief Orooaeeka, we &s;uppo&s;ed to be in length, from S. S. W. to N. N. E. about eight leagues, and in breadth about four leagues, and to lie in latitude 21.54. long. 201.42. made a mo&s;t delightful appearance, and, as Capt. Cook was made to un|der&s;tand, abounded in every thing of which the &s;hips were in want; it may therefore ea&s;ily be conceived, with what reluctance we left it. Some peculiarities were ob&s;erved by tho&s;e who attended Capt. Cook, particularly in the dre&s;s both of the men and women, who wore a kind of &s;andals, made of bark, upon their feet; on their heads caps, probably of their own manufacture, richly ornamented, and encircled with party-coloured plumage. They were above the middle &s;tature, mo&s;t of them &s;eemingly from five feet ten inches, to &s;ix feet &s;ix inches; well-made, tattowed, and like tho&s;e of the Friendly I&s;les, were without clothes, except a kind of apron which encircled their wai&s;ts, reaching little more than half way down their thighs. Both men and women were armed with &s;pears thirteen or fourteen feet long; and the men had ma&s;&s;y clubs be&s;ides, about three feet long, of a hard wood and very heavy. Armed with the&s;e weapons, 5 or 600 people were drawn up upon the beach, who eagerly gazed at the &s;hips, having probably never &s;een an European ve&s;&s;el

Their canoes were of curious workman&s;hip, &s;eemingly cut out of the &s;olid wood, poli&s;hed and decorated with carvings that indicated both ta&s;te and de&s;ign. Their very paddles were poli&s;hed and inlaid with &s;hells, as were mo&s;t of their weapons of war. [Capt. Cook's relation differs nothing in &s;ub&s;tance from the above.]</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, before ten in the morning, the man at the ma&s;t-head called out, land a-head, di&s;tance &s;even or eight leagues, lying N. by E.</P>
<P>[Next morning, April 1&s;t, we had got a-brea&s;t of its North end. At the &s;ame time another i&s;land was in view, but much &s;maller; we preferred the former, as mo&s;t likely to furni&s;h a &s;upply of food for the cattle, of which we began to be in great want.]</P>
<P>[At eleven we hauled in for the land, but as there was but little wind, and that unfavourable, at eight next morning (April 2d) we were full two leagues to leeward.]</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving &s;everal canoes ha&s;tening towards us, waving green branches, which we under|&s;tood were en&s;igns of peace; the&s;e we an|&s;wered, and one, who appeared to be a chief, came on board the Di&s;covery, with a large bough in his hand, and another was &s;een to a&s;cend the &s;ide of the Re&s;olution. After the u&s;ual ceremonies, and &s;ome pre&s;ents of little va|lue had pa&s;&s;ed, while Capt. Clerke was endea|vouring to make his wants known to the Indian, Omai came on board by Capt. Cook's direction, who here could make him&s;elf perfectly under|&s;tood. The chief addre&s;&s;ed him in a &s;olemn &s;peech, which, though Omai pretended to inter|pret,
<PB N="75" REF="144">
very little of it could be under&s;tood by any one el&s;e. He then was introduced by Omai to the Captain, to whom he pre&s;ented his green bough, at the &s;ame time inviting him a&s;hore, and promi&s;ing to furni&s;h him with whatever re|fre&s;hments the i&s;land produced. This invitation was accepted, the boats were ordered out, and the Captain, with Omai, and &s;uitable attendants, were in&s;tantly landed. But what was Omai's &s;urprize, when among the crowd of &s;pectators on the beach, he &s;aw, or thought he &s;aw, &s;ome of his country|men &s;triving to come forward.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of more than 200 leagues, with an immen&s;e ocean intervening, by what miracle could men be brought &s;o far who had no other vehicle of conveyance than wretched open boats, that &s;eldom can be tru&s;ted out of &s;ight of land! Omai could hardly believe his eyes, and was eager to be convinced. The &s;trangers were three in number, who were all equally &s;urprized, and equally impatient to hear Omai's adven|tures, and Omai to know theirs. Omai took them a&s;ide, and entertained them with a plea&s;ing relation of all that had happened to him&s;elf; and they in return acquainted Omai with what had befallen them. Their &s;tory was truly pitiable; they &s;aid, that of 30 Uliteans, they were the only &s;urvivors; that about twelve years ago, they with their families and friends going from Ulitea to &s;ettle at Otaheite, were overtaken in a dreadful tempe&s;t, by which they were driven into the main ocean; that the &s;torm continuing to increa&s;e, and the &s;ea to run mountains high, the women and children were wa&s;hed over board, and peri&s;hed before they experienced any further di&s;tre&s;s; that after three days, when the &s;torm abated, tho&s;e who remained, found them&s;elves in an unknown
<PB N="76" REF="145">
ocean, with little more provi&s;ions than was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;erve them another day; that having no pilot to direct their cour&s;e, nor any &s;ign by which to &s;teer, they continued to go be|fore the wind day after day, till famine had re|duced their number to le&s;s than fifteen; that tho&s;e who &s;urvived, had nothing but the &s;ea-weed which they found floating in the &s;ea, and the wa|ter which they &s;aved when it rained, to keep them alive; that, ten days having elap&s;ed, and no land in pro&s;pect, de&s;pair took place of hope, and &s;e|veral unable to &s;upport the pangs of hunger, jump|ed over board in their phrenzy, and peri&s;hed by an ea&s;y death; the groans and lamentations of the dying, and the terrible agonies with which &s;ome were affected before death came to their relief, exceeded all de&s;cription. In this melancholy &s;ituation they had exi&s;ted for thirteen days, and how much longer they could have no recollection, for they were taken up in&s;en&s;ible of pain, and hardly to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the emaciated bodies of the dead among whom they were found, &s;eemingly without life or motion, till by the friendly care of their deliverers they were re|&s;tored. When they recovered, they &s;aid, it was like waking from a dream: they knew not where they were, nor how they came upon land; but being told that they were taken up at &s;ea, and in what condition, as their &s;en&s;es gradually re|turned, they by degrees recollected all the cir|cum&s;tances already related; they added, that ever &s;ince they were brought to life, they had remained with their deliverers, and were now quite reconciled to their condition, and happy in the &s;ituation in which the Eatooa or good &s;pirit had placed them. Omai, after hearing their relation, with which he was apparently much affected, told them, they
<PB N="77" REF="146">
might now take the opportunity of returning home with him; that he would intercede for them; and that he was &s;ure if they cho&s;e it, the chiefs of the expedition would grant his reque&s;t. They thanked Omai for his kindne&s;s; nor had they any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;uch an offer would ever be made them again: but they were now determined to end their days with the peo|ple who had re&s;tored them to &s;econd life; and as their deare&s;t relations and friends were of the num|ber of tho&s;e who peri&s;hed, the return to their own country would now only renew their grief, and in&s;tead of offording them plea&s;ure, would but increa&s;e their melancholy. This interview over, Omai joined his a&s;&s;ociates, and proceeded with Capt. Clerke, as his interpreter. After hearing their &s;tory, Omai returned to his company; and Capt. Clerke, who had been joined by Lieutenant Gore from the Re&s;olution, held &s;ome conver&s;ation with the natives, who received them in the mo&s;t friendly manner; and, before their return to the &s;hips, a double canoe, in which were twelve men, was &s;een along-&s;ide the Re&s;olution. One of the&s;e men as they approached the &s;hip, &s;tood up and repeated &s;ome words by way of recitatives, and was &s;oon joined by the re&s;t in full chorus. Their &s;ong was no &s;ooner ended, than they all went on board, and one, who appeared to be the chief, pre&s;ented Capt. Cook with a pig, a few cocoa-nuts, and a piece of matting. They were all ad|mitted into the great cabin: &s;ome objects &s;eemed to &s;trike them, but none fixed their attention, till they came to the &s;heep and goats. The hor&s;es and cows evidently &s;truck them with fear; but the &s;heep and the goats came nearer to the level of their comprehen&s;ion. They knew, they &s;aid, they were birds. They were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with pre&s;ents; but
<PB N="78" REF="147">
the chief went away &s;eemingly di&s;&s;atisfied. He had &s;et his heart upon a dog; and accordingly, early next morning a canoe was ob&s;erved making towards the &s;hip, in which was a large hog, &s;ome plantains, and cocoa-nuts, for Capt. Cook, for which the people in the canoe were to accept of nothing but a dog in exchange. On board the Re&s;olution one of the gentlemen had a dog and the dog's mate, which had long been nui&s;ances, and which might now have been di&s;po&s;ed of for a laudable purpo&s;e of propagating a race of u&s;eful animals among a friendly people; however, he thought otherwi&s;e; but Omai &s;pared them a dog, and they returned highly gratified.</P>
<P>Mr. Gore on his return, had reported to Capt. Cook, Omai's adventure with his three friends, and had reported the &s;tate of the i&s;land to be &s;uch, as to afford no &s;upply of food for the cattle which were ready to &s;tarve, unle&s;s they could be pre|vailed upon to bring acro&s;s the reef the &s;tems and leaves of plaintain-trees, with which the i&s;land &s;eemed to abound; and this he believed they might be prevailed upon to furni&s;h, as they had it now in their power to make their wants fully explained by means of Omai and his country|men. Capt. Cook, though he had but little hopes that the natives, friendly as they appeared to be, would yet be &s;o ungenerous as to de&s;troy the young &s;tock that &s;upplied them with food, to accommo|date them, immediately con&s;ented to make trial of their bounty.</P>
<P>Accordingly, about ten in the morning of the 3d, Mr. Gore, with two of the Re&s;olution's boats, and one from the Di&s;covery were &s;ent as far as the reef, with orders to wait there till the return of the gentlemen who were to make the experiment, among whom was Mr. Gore, Mr. Ander&s;on, and
<PB N="79" REF="148">
Omai from the Re&s;olution, and Mr. Burney from the Di&s;covery. As &s;oon as they were &s;een mak|ing for the &s;hore, they were met by &s;everal of the natives with cocoa-nuts, and being told by Omai, that they wi&s;hed to land, two canoes came from the &s;hore, in one of which Mr. Burney and Mr. Ander&s;on entered unarmed, and were landed &s;afe|ly on the reef, over which they were conducted by two of the natives, one &s;upporting the arm of Mr. Burney, and the other the arm of Mr. Ander&s;on, till they had both cro&s;&s;ed the rugged &s;tones, and had reached the beach. They were then conducted by their friendly guides through a crowd, who having ju&s;t gratified their curio&s;ity by viewing the dog, diverted their attention to admire the men, and pre&s;&s;ed upon them &s;o clo&s;e|ly, as prevented their proceeding, till &s;ome of them, who &s;eemed to be per&s;ons in authority, dealt their blows pretty &s;everely about them to beat them off. The two gentlemen were then led up an avenue of cocoa-palms, till they came to a number of men drawn up in ranks, with their clubs &s;houldered, through which they were march|ed, till they came to a chief &s;itting on the ground fanning him&s;elf, without any other ornament to di&s;tingui&s;h him than a large bunch of beautiful red feathers in his ears, projecting forwards. This chief they were de&s;ired to &s;alute as he &s;at, accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of the country. From him they were led to another, a per&s;on, for a young man, of unu&s;ual corpulence, and having repeated their &s;alutations as before; they were then led to a third chief, who, after being &s;aluted, de&s;ired them to &s;it down, which they were very ready to do, being &s;ufficiently fatigued in going through the ceremony.&mdash;Almo&s;t in&s;tantly the crowd were &s;eparated, and at the di&s;tance of about thirty

yards, twenty fine girls neatly dre&s;&s;ed and orna|mented with red feathers, came forward dancing to their own &s;ong, which they continued without the lea&s;t embarra&s;&s;ment till their dance was ended. Thus agreeably entertained, both the officer and the philo&s;opher forgot for a moment, that they were without their a&s;&s;ociates, and in want of their interpreter; when ha&s;tily ri&s;ing to look about for them, they at length found them coming up in form to the three chiefs, who&s;e names were Otte|roo, Taroa, and Fatoweera; and being all now met, they took the opportunity to make known their commi&s;&s;ion; for great pains had been taken to keep them apart, for when the third chief was told by Mr. Ander&s;on that he would be glad to &s;peak with Omai, the chief peremptorily refu&s;ed his reque&s;t. In the mean time they found the na|tives began to make free with their pockets; which the chief, in&s;tead of repre&s;&s;ing, &s;eemed to encou|rage. They now began to apprehend a concert|ed de&s;ign of detaining them, and to blame their own indi&s;cretion in putting them&s;elves &s;o wholly in their power, for in their &s;ituation they were as effectually cut off from the &s;hips as if half the ocean had lain between them. This they inti|mated to each other; and Omai, who was valiant only when no danger was near, caught the panic, and, &s;eeing a hole dug for an oven, could hardly be per&s;uaded but that it was to roa&s;t and eat him. However, to put their &s;u&s;picions to the proof, Mr. Ander&s;on and Mr. Burney attempted to reach the beach; but were &s;topt about half way, and told they mu&s;t return to the place they had left. In this manner they were kept in &s;u&s;|pence the greate&s;t part of the day; &s;ometimes gazing at them; &s;ometimes talking to Omai, and &s;ometimes pu&s;hing back their clothes to admire

their &s;kin; and when the chiefs were pre&s;&s;ed on the bu&s;ine&s;s they were &s;ent upon, they were told they mu&s;t &s;tay and eat with them before their re|que&s;t could be granted. While Omai was en|tertaining the chiefs with the &s;tory of his travels, Mr. Ander&s;on and Mr. Burney made a &s;econd at|tempt; and Mr. Ander&s;on had actually reached the beach, and was beginning to wade in upon the reef, when he was rudely pulled back, and told he mu&s;t return.</P>
<P>Finding all their efforts in vain to relea&s;e them|&s;elves, they made a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, and did as they were bid. But the i&s;landers ob&s;erving &s;ome|thing like fear in them, brought &s;ome green boughs, and &s;ticking them in the ground, de&s;ired them to hold them in their hands as they &s;at, probably to pre&s;erve them from being incom|moded by the crowd. And &s;oon after the &s;econd chief, having fir&s;t formed a ring, ordered dinner. Fir&s;t, a pretty con&s;iderable number of cocoa-nuts were brought, and &s;hortly after a long green ba&s;|ket with a quantity of baked plantains, &s;ufficient to have &s;erved half the &s;hip's company; and la&s;tly, part of a young hog nicely dre&s;&s;ed; and Omai was treated with kava, the drink he had been u&s;ed to in his own country. As &s;oon as dinner was over, they were told they might depart; and being conducted to the beach, they found canoes ready to carry them to their boats, in which were a few plantain-trees already embarked, but not enough to &s;erve the cattle a &s;ingle week.</P>
<P>Though the people &s;eemed not ill-di&s;po&s;ed, it was not in fact, in their power, without di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing them&s;elves, to afford any effectual &s;upply; and indeed they were &s;o vain of their ho&s;pitality to &s;trangers, that, as Omai &s;aid, they dignified their i&s;land with the name of <HI>Wenooa no te Ea|tooa,</HI>

the Land of Gods. Lat. 201.1. long. 201.45. E.</P>
<P>On the 4th, in the morning, the &s;hips made &s;ail, and with an ea&s;y breeze came up with the &s;mall i&s;land, already mentioned, which, tho' &s;ur|rounded with a reef like that we had ju&s;t left, yet there being no inhabitants to oppo&s;e them, our boats made good their landing, and brought off about 100 cocoa-nuts for each &s;hip, &s;ome gra&s;s for the cattle, and as much as they could load of leaves and branches of the young cocoa-trees, and of the tree called Wharra, which being cut &s;mall, was eaten by the cattle with great greedine&s;s. The boats no &s;ooner returned, and were hoi&s;ted on board, than we &s;et &s;ail to the Northward.</P>
<P>And on the 6th, in the morning, the man at the ma&s;t-head called out, Land, which was &s;oon an&s;wered by the Re&s;olution. About three in the afternoon we fell in with Hervey's I&s;le, &s;een by Capt. Cook in his fir&s;t voyage, in lat. 19.15. long. 201.6. E. The boats were in&s;tantly got out to &s;earch for &s;oundings, but found none; &s;tood off and on all night.</P>
<P>Next morning, the 7th, &s;everal canoes came off, brandi&s;hing their &s;pears, and threatening us, apparently, in a ho&s;tile manner. The boats, however, were again &s;ent in &s;earch of anchorage, and in pa&s;&s;ing the canoes, an officer &s;itting care|le&s;sly in one of the boats, was near being pulled over-board by a native, who made a &s;pring to &s;natch &s;omething he had in his hand; but mi&s;&s;ing his aim, plunged in&s;tantly into the &s;ea. They then became very trouble&s;ome, till a great gun was fired from our &s;hip, which in a moment di&s;|per&s;ed them. In the evening the boats returned, with no better &s;ucce&s;s than before. In the mean time, Capt. Cook having di&s;played a white flag
<PB N="83" REF="154">
in token of peace, they did the &s;ame, and then came on board friendly. But though water was here equally unattainable as in the other i&s;lands of this group, the night was &s;pent in &s;tanding on and off.</P>
<P>On the 6th, in the morning, we &s;et &s;ail; and on the 7th came in &s;ight of another i&s;land, lat. 19.15. long. 201.35.</P>
<P>On the 7th tacked and &s;tood in for land. For the la&s;t 24 hours the &s;torms of thunder, lightning, and rain, were almo&s;t ince&s;&s;ant, in&s;omuch, that it was found nece&s;&s;ary to cover the &s;cuttles of the magazine to &s;ecure the powder. The people in both &s;hips were now employed in catching water, which though none of the be&s;t, becau&s;e of its tarry ta&s;te, was yet richly prized; and he who could &s;ave but a gallon a-day when the rains be|gan, thought his labour amply rewarded; but this proving the rainy &s;ea&s;on, we in a few days filled all our empty ca&s;ks, and every man had li|berty to u&s;e what he plea&s;ed. Before the&s;e heavy rains fell and furni&s;hed them with a &s;upply, the people on board the Re&s;olution had been greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for water, as we have already remarked; but now it was determined to direct our cour&s;e to Anomocoa, or Rotterdam I&s;land, and accordingly that i&s;land was appointed a place of rendezvous, in ca&s;e of &s;eparation. The weather continued variable, and though plenty of rain fell almo&s;t every day, yet it was found advi&s;eable to make u&s;e of the machine on board the Re&s;olution, and to u&s;e water obtained by di&s;tillation for every purpo&s;e for which it was fit. It was apt to di&s;|colour the meat that was boiled with it, and to tincture every thing with a di&s;agreeable blackne&s;s: but it was rather preferred to rain water, becau&s;e of the tarry ta&s;te communicated by the latter.

Cour&s;e in the evening, S. W. lat. 19.30. long. 200.51. Nothing remarkable till</P>
<P>The 12th, when we came in &s;ight of land, bearing W. S. W. di&s;tance about eight or nine leagues. It appeared like four i&s;lands. We made &s;ail, and &s;tood for the land; but a heavy tempe&s;t coming on, involved us in darkne&s;s. In the evening we hove to, and &s;o continued during the night.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 14th, the boats were or|dered out, and about noon returned, having found good anchorage in 12 and 15 fathom water, fine &s;andy bottom near the &s;hore. The boats came back laden with the fruits of the i&s;land, which they made free with, having &s;een no inhabitants. We no &s;ooner ca&s;t anchor, than parties from both &s;hips were &s;ent out to reconnoitre.</P>
<P>The i&s;let where we landed was little more than a mile in circumference, and not more than 3 feet above the &s;urface of the &s;ea; notwith&s;tanding which, it is &s;o covered with trees and bu&s;hes, and among them &s;ometimes cocoa-palms.</P>
<P>[Men-of-war birds, tropic birds, and two &s;orts of boobies, were here found &s;o tame, that being on their ne&s;ts, they &s;uffered the people to take them off with their hands. Of each &s;ort great numbers were killed, which, however, would hardly have been thought eatable in better circum&s;tances. They likewi&s;e met with crabs creeping on the trees.]</P>
<P>At one part of the reef, which bounds the lake within, there was a large bed of coral, almo&s;t even with the &s;urface, which afforded, perhaps, one of the mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pects that Nature has any where produced. Its ba&s;e was fixed to the &s;hore, but &s;o deep that it could not be &s;een: &s;o that the upper &s;urface &s;eemed to be &s;u&s;pended
<PB N="85" REF="156">
in the water, which deepened &s;o &s;uddenly, that at the di&s;tance of a few yards there might be &s;even or eight fathoms. The &s;ea was at this time quite unruffled, and the &s;un &s;hining bright, expo&s;ed the various &s;orts of coral in the mo&s;t beautiful order; &s;ome parts branching into the water with great luxuriance; others lying collected in round balls, and in various other figures; all which were greatly heightened by &s;pangles of the riche&s;t colours, that glowed from a number of large clams, every where inter&s;per&s;ed. But the appear|ance of the&s;e was &s;till inferior to that of the mul|titude of fi&s;hes that glided gently along, &s;eemingly with the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity. The colours of the different &s;orts were the mo&s;t beautiful that can be imagined; yellow, blue, red, black, &amp;c. far exceeding any thing that art can produce. Their various forms al&s;o contributed not a little to in|crea&s;e the richne&s;s of this &s;ub-marine grotto, which could not be &s;urveyed without a plea&s;ing tran&s;port, mixed, however, with regret, that a work &s;o &s;uperlatively elegant, &s;hould be concealed in a place where mankind could &s;eldom have an opportunity of rendering the prai&s;es &s;o ju&s;tly due to &s;o enchanting a &s;cene.</P>
<P>Here, and in the adjoining i&s;lets, the &s;hips continued till the 17th, during which they did not &s;pend their time unprofitably; for having taken on board a plentiful &s;upply of food for the cattle, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have peri&s;hed, they had al&s;o procured more than 1200 cocoa-nuts, which were equally divided between the crews.]</P>
<P>It mu&s;t doubtle&s;s &s;urpri&s;e the greate&s;t part of our readers, and perhaps &s;tagger their belief, when they are told of &s;o many i&s;lands abounding with inhabitants, who &s;ub&s;i&s;t with little or no fre&s;h wa|ter. Yet true it is, that few or none of the little
<PB N="86" REF="157">
low i&s;lands between the tropics, have any water on the &s;urface of the ground, except perhaps in a lagoon, the water of which is generally bracki&s;h; nor is it ea&s;y to find water by digging. The fact is, the fruits of the earth are the chief food of the inhabitants, and the milk of the cocoa-nut &s;erves them for drink. They want no water to boil any part of their food, for they knew not the art of boiling till the Europeans taught them, nor had they a ve&s;&s;el fitted for the purpo&s;e; neither have they any occa&s;ion for wa&s;hing their clothes, becau&s;e the materials of which they are made being of the paper kind, will not bear wa&s;hing. Salt water, therefore, an&s;wers their purpo&s;e with very little fre&s;h, and adds a reli&s;h to their meat, which, when it is dre&s;&s;ed, they dip into &s;ea-water every mouthful that they eat. This in a great mea&s;ure accounts for their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting without fre&s;h water, tho' in the climate of England it would not be ea&s;y to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it a &s;ingle week. And now, having &s;upplied the &s;hips with the produce of this i&s;land, and not being able to find anchor|age near any of tho&s;e adjoining, we prepared to depart.</P>
<P>On the 17th, orders were given to &s;ail; but in the evening, when the gentlemen returned, three mu&s;kets, three cartouch boxes, and three hangers were mi&s;&s;ing. The&s;e were the arms of three marines, who had accompanied the gentle|men in an excur&s;ion up the country, and who had committed their arms to the care of their com|rades; the&s;e, on their return, had forgotten them. They were, however, recovered by &s;ending the marines on &s;hore, who &s;oon found them, and brought them off. On the return of the boat, we in&s;tantly put to &s;ea, &s;teering N. W. The i&s;lands
<PB N="87" REF="158">
we had ju&s;t left were the Palmer&s;ton I&s;les, in lat. 18.11. and long. 98.14. E.</P>
<P>On the 20th, we varied our cour&s;e, &s;teering W. N. W. all night.</P>
<P>On the 22d, clear weather, but a great &s;well from the South, a &s;ure pre&s;age of an approaching &s;torm. This day we altered our cour&s;e to S. S. W. with the wind variable.</P>
<P>On the 25th, the expected &s;torm came on, which increa&s;ed to &s;uch an alarming height be|fore-night, attended with thunder, lightning, and rain, with a tremendous &s;ea, that with all our &s;ails handed, and our top-gallant yards &s;truck, we were obliged to lie to under bare poles till morning appeared.</P>
<P>On the 26th, the &s;torm being &s;omewhat abated, the Re&s;olution, of which we had lo&s;t &s;ight, bore down to us; and at five in the afternoon we made &s;ail under clo&s;e reefed top-&s;ails. About eleven at night we narrowly e&s;caped running on &s;hore on Savage I&s;land, the man at the ma&s;t-head calling out, Land; when, dark as it was, we &s;oon got &s;ight of it clo&s;e on our lee-bow, &s;teering directly for it. We in&s;tantly put about and fired a gun as a &s;ignal for the Re&s;olution (then to windward about half a mile) to do the &s;ame. So narrow an e&s;cape made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;hip's company, who, thoughtle&s;s as they are, could not help looking up to heaven with thankful hearts for &s;o &s;ignal a deliverance. As &s;oon as it was light next morning, we &s;aw this execrated i&s;land, at the di&s;|tance of about four leagues. Lat. ob&s;. 19.44. long. 188.3.</P>
<P>On the 27th, heavy thunder and rain. Cour&s;e S. &frac12; W. lat. 20.37. long. 186.57.</P>
<P>On the 29th, our carpenter's mate had the misfortune to fall down upon deck and break his
<PB N="88" REF="159">
leg. Happy that no other misfortune had be|fallen us during a &s;eries of tempe&s;tuous weather, which few &s;hips would have been able to re&s;i&s;t. About nine in the morning, the &s;torm &s;till conti|nuing, but the &s;ky in part clear, the man at the ma&s;t-head called out, Land, which was pre&s;ently known to be Anomocoa, or Rotterdam I&s;land, &s;o called by the Dutch who fir&s;t di&s;covered it, bear|ing S. W. di&s;tance about four or five leagues. At ten &s;aw two mountains, bearing S. S. W. di&s;tance about nine or ten leagues, and &s;oon after a great &s;moak was &s;een to a&s;cend from the lowermo&s;t. The weather &s;till continuing &s;qually, we ap|proached Anomocoa with great caution. About five in the afternoon, the &s;ignal was made from the Re&s;olution, to come to, which we obeyed, and about &s;ix ca&s;t anchor.</P>
<P>On the 30th, we weighed again, and in the evening, worked into Anomocoa road. About &s;ix we moored, and was &s;oon after joined by the Re|&s;olution. We had now been ju&s;t &s;ixty days in a pa&s;&s;age, which, in a direct cour&s;e, could not have exceeded ten, and had been expo&s;ed to the &s;e|vere&s;t trials, owing to &s;ome fatality in pur&s;uing a cour&s;e which there was not a &s;eaman on board that did not di&s;approve. It &s;eemed to have no object of di&s;covery in view, as we fell nearly into the &s;ame track which our Commodore had formerly navigated; nor did we meet with a &s;ingle i&s;land, which one or other of our late Voyagers had not &s;een or vi&s;ited in their different cour&s;es. How it happened is not ea&s;y to be accounted for, as it was next to a miracle that any creature on board the Re&s;olution remained alive to reach our pre&s;ent harbour. Had not the copious rains that fell almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly from the time we pa&s;&s;ed the Tropic till our arrival here, &s;upplied the daily
<PB N="89" REF="160">
con&s;umption of water on board our &s;hips, not only the animals, but the men mu&s;t have peri&s;hed. Happy, however, that we now found our&s;elves in &s;afety on a friendly coa&s;t. We forgot the dan|gers we had e&s;caped, and thought only of enjoy|ing with double plea&s;ure the &s;weets of the&s;e happy i&s;lands, who&s;e &s;pontaneous productions perfume the air to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance with a fragrance inconceivably reviving; and who&s;e plantations exhibit a richne&s;s of pro&s;pect as we approached them, owing to the beautiful intermixture of the various blo&s;&s;oms, with the vivid green leaves of the trees, of which the mo&s;t animated de&s;cription can communicate but a faint idea. Add to the&s;e, the tufted clumps that naturally adorn the little ri&s;ing hills, that appear every where delightfully inter&s;per&s;ed among verdant lawns and rich mea|dows, bordered by rivulets of water, which among the i&s;lands in the tropical climates, are as rare as they are refre&s;hing; and nothing in nature can be more plea&s;ing to the eye, or more grateful to the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>May 1. We were no &s;ooner moored in the harbour, than we were &s;urrounded with innumer|able little boats, or canoes, mo&s;t curiou&s;ly con|&s;tructed and ornamented; the &s;ides with a poli&s;h that &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the blacke&s;t ebony, and the decks inlaid with mother of pearl and tortoi&s;e-&s;hell, equal to the be&s;t cabinets of European manufac|ture. In this kind of workman&s;hip tho&s;e i&s;landers &s;eem to excel. Their weapons of war, their clubs, the handles of their working tools, the paddles of their boats, and even their fi&s;h-hooks, are po|li&s;hed and inlaid with variegated &s;hells; with an infinite accumulation of which their &s;hores are margined; and among them our Naturali&s;ts found &s;ome of &s;uperlative beauty. The&s;e boats
<PB N="90" REF="161">
held generally three per&s;ons, and under their decks, which take up two-thirds of their length, they brought the fruits of their plantations and the maunufactures of their country; the&s;e la&s;t con&s;i&s;ting, be&s;ides cloth of different fabrics, of a great variety of things u&s;eful, and others orna|mental. Of the fir&s;t &s;ort were combs, fi&s;h-hooks, lines, nets made after the European fa&s;hion, nee|dles made of bone, with thread of different finene&s;s, pur&s;es, caliba&s;hes made of reeds &s;o clo&s;ely wrought as to be water-tight; with a variety of other uten|&s;ils. Among the latter were bracelets, brea&s;t-plates ornamented with feathers of a vivid glow; ma&s;ks, mantelets compo&s;ed of feathers &s;o artfully and beautifully arranged, as even our Engli&s;h ladies would not have di&s;dained to wear. The&s;e were of immen&s;e value in the Society I&s;les, where Omai &s;aid a fine red feather would purcha&s;e a hog; and of the&s;e, and red feathers, Omai laid in a &s;tore.</P>
<P>The people of the&s;e i&s;lands have already been &s;o well de&s;cribed by Capt. Cook and Mr. For&s;ter, that what we have now to add is rather to confirm their accounts than to advance any thing new. We found them of a friendly di&s;po&s;ition, generous, ho&s;pitable, and ready to oblige. Some there were among them mo&s;t villainou&s;ly given to thieving; but that propen&s;ity did not appear to them &s;o much a vice in the light we are apt to con&s;ider it, as a craft &s;ynonymous to <HI>cunning,</HI> ac|cording to our acceptation of the word. He who was detected and puni&s;hed, was neither pitied nor de&s;pi&s;ed by his neighbours. Even the Arees, or great men among them, thought it no crime to practi&s;e that craft upon our Commanders whenever they found an opportunity, and would only laugh when they were detected; ju&s;t as a cunning fellow in England would laugh, when he had found an
<PB N="91" REF="162">
opportunity of out-witting an hone&s;ter man than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the u&s;ual ceremonies had pa&s;&s;ed, and peace was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Commanders of both &s;hips gave orders, that no per&s;on, of whatever rank, on board, &s;hould purcha&s;e any thing of the natives, till the &s;hips were &s;upplied with pro|vi&s;ions. This order was i&s;&s;ued for two purpo&s;es; one to regulate the prices, the other to oblige the natives to bring their provi&s;ions to market, when they found that nothing el&s;e was &s;aleable; and it produced the de&s;ired effect. The number of hogs and fruit that were brought, were greater than the daily con&s;umption, though the ordinary &s;hip-allowance was entirely &s;topt, and the produce of the i&s;lands &s;erved out in its &s;tead. We even &s;alted for &s;everal days, from four to &s;ix hogs a-day.</P>
<P>The civility of the Chiefs was not confined to their readine&s;s to &s;upply the &s;hips with provi&s;ions. They complimented the Commanding Officers with the u&s;e of a magnificent hou&s;e, [a large boat-hou&s;e] conveniently &s;ituated upon the beach, during their &s;tay; and at the &s;ame time pre&s;ented them with brea&s;t-plates mo&s;t beautifully decorated with feathers, being the riche&s;t pre&s;ents they had to make. In return, the Commanders were not wanting in genero&s;ity, loading them with hatchets, knives, linen cloth, gla&s;s, and beads; with which they thought them&s;elves amply repaid.</P>
<P>May 2. The tents were this day carried on &s;hore; the A&s;tronomer's ob&s;ervatory erected; wooders and waterers appointed; and all the ar|tificers on board employed in the reparations of the &s;hips; not a few being wanting, after a voy|age of two months, through a tempe&s;tuous &s;ea,
<PB N="92" REF="163">
during which the elements of fire, air, and water, might be &s;aid to have been in perpetual conflict.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were about, the Command|ers and Chiefs were every day contriving to vary the plea&s;ures of their re&s;pective gue&s;ts, and to entertain them with new diver&s;ions. They were mutually engaged on board and on &s;hore, to &s;ur|pri&s;e each other with novelty. On board, the Chiefs were entertained with mu&s;ic, dancing, and fea&s;ting, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> manner; and with what &s;eemed much more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> to them, as they paid more attention to it, with the various operations of the artificers, who were at work on their re&s;pective employments. The facility with which the boat-builders performed their work, particularly attracted their notice; when they be|held the labour of a year with them, performed in a week by the &s;ame number of hands on board, their a&s;toni&s;hment was beyond conception; nor were they le&s;s in amazement to &s;ee large timber cut through the middle and &s;awed into planks, while they were &s;pectators, which they had no means of effecting in their i&s;land in many days. On &s;hore, the Chiefs, in return, endeavoured to entertain the Commanders; they fea&s;ted them like tropical kings, with barbicued hogs, fowls, and with the mo&s;t delicious fruits; and, for wine, they offered them a liquor made before their faces, in a manner not to be mentioned without di&s;gu&s;t; but as the Chiefs had refu&s;ed to drink wine on board, our Commanders, and tho&s;e who attended them, needed no other apology for refu&s;ing to partake of this liquor with them. They likewi&s;e, after dinner, introduced their mu&s;ic and dancers, who were chiefly women of the theatrical ca&s;t, and excelled in agility and varied attitudes, many of the be&s;t performers in Europe; a kind of pan|tomime
<PB N="93" REF="164">
&s;ucceeded, in which &s;ome prize-fighters di&s;played their feats of arms; and this part of the drama concluded with a humourous repre&s;entation of &s;ome laughable &s;tory, which produced among the Chief and their attendants the most immoderate mirth. The &s;ong&s;ters came la&s;t, the melody of who&s;e voices was heightened by a kind of accom|panyment not unu&s;ual in the earlie&s;t ages, among the polite&s;t nations, as may be learnt from ancient paintings, where the &s;ingers and dancers are repre|&s;ented with flat clams or &s;hells in their hands, clapping them together, quickly or &s;lowly, to re|gulate their movements, and harmonize their tunes.</P>
<P>[Though this farcical exhibition was otherwi&s;e in&s;ipid to us, it was not wholly without its u&s;e, in marking a &s;imilarity of manners among man|kind, at the di&s;tance of half the globe, and at a period when the arts of civil life were in their in|fancy. Who knows but that the &s;eeds of the liberal arts, that have now been &s;own by European navigators in the&s;e happy climes, may, a thou&s;and years hence, be ripened into maturity; and that the people who are how emerging from ignorance into &s;cience, may, when the memory of the&s;e Voyages are forgotten, be found in the zenith of their improvements by other Adventurers; who may pride them&s;elves as the fir&s;t di&s;coverers of new countries, and an unknown people, infinitely &s;uperior to tho&s;e who, at that time, may inhabit the&s;e regions, and who may have lo&s;t their boa&s;ted arts, as we at this day &s;ee among the wretched inhabitants of Greece, and the &s;till more mi&s;erable &s;laves of Egyptian bondage. Such are the vici&s;&s;i|tudes to which the inhabitants of this little orb are &s;ubject; and &s;uch, perhaps, are the vici&s;&s;i|tudes which the globe it&s;elf must undergo before its final di&s;&s;olution. To a contemplative mind,
<PB N="94" REF="165">
the&s;e i&s;lands pre&s;ent a mortifying &s;pectacle of the ruins of a broken and de&s;olated portion of the earth; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;urvey &s;o many frag|ments of rocks, &s;ome with inhabitants and &s;ome without, and not conclude with the learned and ingenious Dr. Burnet, that they are the effects of &s;ome early convul&s;ion of the earth, of which no hi&s;tory gives any account. But to return.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here, we were nightly enter|tained with the fiery eruptions of the neighbour|ing volcanos, of which notice has been taken by former Voyagers. There are two mountains that occa&s;ionally emit fire and &s;moke; but that called Kollifeau is the mo&s;t con&s;tant.</P>
<P>May 4. Being the 5th day of our re&s;idence at Anomocoa, our wooders returned, almo&s;t blinded by the rains that fell from the manchionello-trees, [faitanoo-trees, &s;ays Capt. Cook, a &s;pecies of pep|per which yields a corro&s;ive &s;ap, of a milky colour] and with blotches all over tho&s;e parts of their bodies to which the rains happened to have acce&s;s. The poi&s;onous quality of the&s;e trees has been noticed by other Voyagers, but was more &s;everely felt upon this occa&s;ion, than by any of our people in the like &s;ituation in the former Voyages. Many capital thefts were committed during our &s;tay, and &s;ome articles of con&s;iderable value were car|ried off.</P>
<P>This day, Capt. Clerke's &s;teel-yards were &s;tolen out of his cabin, while he, with other gentlemen, were entertained by the Chiefs with a Heiva, or dramatic farce on &s;hore, but was afterwards reco|vered. On the &s;ame day, as he was mingled with the crowd, his &s;ci&s;&s;ars was taken out of his pocket three different times, and as often replaced, when mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="166">On the 7th, we unmoored, and &s;hifted our &s;tation; but in &s;o doing we parted our &s;mall bower anchor, with about 27 fathom of cable, the anchor remaining among the rocks. In the evening we moored again. From this day till</P>
<P>The 12th, we were employed in recovering the anchor we had lo&s;t, which, after lo&s;ing the buoy|rope and grappling, was brought on board and &s;ecured. One of the natives &s;tole an axe from the &s;hip, but was di&s;covered, and fired at. He e&s;caped by diving. A party of them had un|la&s;hed the &s;tream anchor, and was lowering it down into the canoe; but being di&s;covered in the act, paddled to &s;hore, and got clear off.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the live &s;tock, which had been landed the day after our arrival, on a &s;mall i&s;land, about half a mile from the &s;hore to graze, were brought on board amazingly recovered; from perfect &s;keletons, the hor&s;es and cows were grown plump, and as playful as young colts. This day orders were i&s;&s;ued for &s;ailing; the tents were &s;truck, and Mr. Phillip&s;on, Lieutenant of Ma|rines, lo&s;t all his bedding, by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the centinel, who received 12 la&s;hes for neglect of duty. In the morning, the long-boat was found &s;wamped, and all the &s;tern &s;heets, and &s;everal other articles belonging to her mi&s;&s;ing, and never recovered, for which the marine who had the care of the watch, was &s;everely puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the 14th, we made &s;ail W. by S. by the advice and direction of a Chief, named Tiooney, [Feenou, &s;o called by Capt. Cook, and &s;aid to be king of the Friendly I&s;les] to an i&s;land [Appee] about 40 leagues di&s;tant, which abounded, he &s;aid, in every thing we wanted; wood, water, hogs, fowls, fruits, and gra&s;s for our cattle. We &s;ailed with a fine breeze, wind N. E. cour&s;e W.

S. W. and about eleven at night, pa&s;&s;ed the burning mountains, bearing N. N. W. di&s;tant about half a mile. The flames ri&s;ing from the lowermo&s;t with a bellowing noi&s;e, louder than thunder, but hoar&s;er and more terrifying, illu|minated the air in the night, and enabled us to work through the mo&s;t dangerous pa&s;&s;age that could po&s;&s;ibly be navigated. We had more than 60 i&s;lands within &s;ight, all of them &s;urrounded with reefs of rocks, with &s;o many windings and turnings as truly might be &s;aid to con&s;titute a labyrinth; but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of our India pi|lot, we pa&s;&s;ed them all in &s;afety, and</P>
<P>On the 17th, moored in a fine bay, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Appee I&s;land, in 22 fathom water, &s;helly bottom. We had &s;carce moored, before we were &s;urrounded with natives from all quarters, who had been apprized of our coming, and who had loaded their canoes with hogs, fowls, bread-fruit, yams, plantains, and every kind of fruit the i&s;land pro|duced, which they exchanged for broken gla&s;s, red and blue beads, &s;hreds of &s;carlet cloth, or indeed any thing we offered them.</P>
<P>On the 18th, the live &s;tock were landed, and a proper guard appointed to look after them.</P>
<P>Here our friend Tiooney, (whom we &s;hall now call Feenou) a&s;&s;umed the &s;ame con&s;equence as a Ammocoa, He came on board with his canoe laden with four large hogs, bread-fruit, and chaddocks, a fine odoriferous fruir, in &s;mell and ta&s;te not unlike a lemon, but larger and more round. He brought likewi&s;e yams of an enor|mous &s;ize, weighing from fifty to &s;ixty pounds each.</P>
<P>He was followed by the Arak&eacute; and Chiefs of the i&s;land, who came laden in the &s;ame manner, with hogs, fowls, and every &s;pecies of provi&s;ions

the i&s;land afforded; the&s;e he introduced in form to the Commanders and Officers according to their rank. This ceremony over, the tents were landed, and all hands &s;et to work to fini&s;h the repairs of the &s;hips. The Chiefs were fea&s;ted on board, and the Commanders and Officers ho&s;pitably en|tertained on &s;hore. On our part fire-works were exhibited, the marines were drawn up, and went through their military manoeuvres, &s;urrounded by thou&s;ands of natives, who were frightened at fir&s;t, and fled; but finding they did no harm, took courage, and rallied at a di&s;tance, but no per&s;ua|&s;ions could prevail upon them to come near. On the part of the natives, they were equally inclined to plea&s;e; they gave Heivas every day; and drew their warriors together, who went likewi&s;e through their military exerci&s;es, and beat one another &s;everely in their mock fights, which, in that re&s;pect, differed but little from our wre&s;t|lers, boxers, and cudgel-players in England. In this manner, and in ranging the i&s;land, botaniz|ing, examining the curio&s;ities, natural and arti|ficial, the Commanders, Gentlemen, and Offi|cers, employed their time, while the live &s;tock were gathering &s;trength, and recruiting their fle&s;h, and the &s;everal artificers were compleating the repairs of the &s;hips. It is not ea&s;y for people, who are totally unacquainted with the language of a country, to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the civil policy of the inhabitants. Indeed it is next to impo&s;&s;ible in a &s;hort re&s;idence among them. As we ob&s;erved no &s;uch medium as money, by which the value of property is a&s;certained, it was not ea&s;y to di&s;cover what el&s;e they had &s;ub&s;ti|tuted in its room, to facilitate the modes of traffic among them&s;elves. That each had a property in the plantation he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, we could plainly di&s;|cern;
<PB N="98" REF="169">
and the Arak&eacute; and Chiefs among them were ready enough to point out their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the extent of which gave them con&s;equence, as among other civilized nations; but no &s;uch thing as circulating property being di&s;coverable, by the hoarding up of which, and laying it out oc|ca&s;ionally to advantage, one might purcha&s;e ano|ther's landed or &s;ub&s;tantial property. We could not inform our&s;elves &s;ufficiently, by what means the fi&s;herman purcha&s;ed his canoe, or the boat-builder his materials; yet there cannot remain a doubt, but that the boat-builder had an intere&s;t in his boat, after it was built, as well as the chief in his plantation, after it was inclo&s;ed and cul|tivated. With us, all was carried on by barter, and an imaginary value fixed on every article. A hog was rated at a hatchet, and &s;o many bread|fruit, cocoa-nuts and plantains at a &s;tring of beads: and &s;o, in like manner throughout; but among them&s;elves, we &s;aw no &s;uch value by way of barter. We did not ob&s;erve &s;o much fruit given for &s;o many fi&s;h; nor &s;o many combs, needles, or u&s;eful materials, for a certain propor|tion of cloth; but doubtle&s;s, &s;ome mode of ex|change there must be among them; for it is cer|tain there was no &s;uch thing as money, at lea&s;t none that we could di&s;cern: neither could we di&s;|cover any modes of gaming among them, which was the more remarkable, as their great men &s;eemed to have nothing to do except tran&s;porting them&s;elves from one place to another, or taking the diver&s;ion of fi&s;hing. Neither could we ob|&s;erve any laws by which their civil policy was re|gulated, notwith&s;tanding which we &s;aw no di&s;or|ders among them, but every thing conducted with the greate&s;t decorum.&mdash;Salt, which is &s;o ne|cessary

an article in European hou&s;e-keeping, was wholly unknown to the tropical i&s;landers.</P>
<P>On the 19th, an Arak&eacute; came on board, and pre&s;ented Capt. Clerke with a large and elegant head-dre&s;s, ornamented with pearls, &s;hells, and red feathers, wreathed with flowers of the mo&s;t re&s;plendent colours. The Captain, in return, loaded him with many u&s;eful articles of European manufacture, knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, &s;aws, and &s;ome &s;howy &s;trings of beads, which were highly prized by this chief, who thought it no di&s;grace, to pad|dle him&s;elf on &s;hore with his rich acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>On the 20th, an affair happened on board the Di&s;covery, that had nearly cancelled all former obligations, and put an end to that friend&s;hip, which mutual acts of civility and genero&s;ity had apparently contributed to cement. One of the chiefs, who had been frequently on board, and who had been of the parties cordially entertain|ed, invited, perhaps, by the familiarity of a young cat, and delighted by its playfulne&s;s, watched his oppportunity to carry it off; but unluckily for him, was detected before he could effect his pur|po&s;e. He was immediately &s;eized and clapt in irons, and an expre&s;s &s;ent on &s;hore, to acquaint the Arak&eacute;, or king, with the greatne&s;s of his crime, and the nature of his puni&s;hment. On this news, the Arak&eacute; him&s;elf, and &s;everal of his chiefs ha&s;|tened on board, when to their grief and a&s;toni&s;h|ment, they found the pri&s;oner to be the king's brother. This news &s;oon circulated, and the whole i&s;land was in commotion. [Feenou] &s;ea|&s;onably interpo&s;ed. He applied to Omai, to know what was to be done, and upon what terms his relea&s;e might be procured. Omai told him, his offence was of &s;uch a nature, as not to be remitted without puni&s;hment; he mu&s;t
<PB N="100" REF="171">
&s;ubmit to be tied up, and receive 100 la&s;hes that the higher he was in rank, the more nece&s;&s;ary it was to puni&s;h him, by way of example, to de|ter others from practices of the like nature; and that therefore it was in vain to plead for his deli|verance, upon any other terms than &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Feenou acquainted the Arak&eacute; with all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and pre&s;ently a number of chiefs entered into con&s;ultation upon the mea&s;ures that were to be pur&s;ued; &s;ome by their ge&s;tures were for re|&s;enting the in&s;ult, and others were for &s;ubmit|ting. Some, in great wrath, were for in&s;tantly returning to &s;hore, and a&s;&s;embling the warriors in order to make reprizals, and no le&s;s than &s;e|ven attempted to leave the &s;hip, but found the way &s;topt, to prevent their e&s;cape. Two or three jumped over-board, but were in&s;tantly fol|lowed, taken up, and brought back. Thus, finding them&s;elves be&s;et on all &s;ides, and the king him&s;elf, as well, as the chiefs in the power of our commanders, they again entered into con&s;ulta|tion; and after half an hour's deliberation, the re&s;ult was, to make a formal &s;urrender of the pri&s;oner to the Arak&eacute; of the &s;hip; to be&s;eech him to mitigate the rigour of his puni&s;hment; and at the &s;ame time to put him in mind of the regard that had been &s;hewn to him and his people, not only by the chiefs of the i&s;land in general, but more particularly by the friends and relations of the offender, who had it &s;till in their power to render them farther &s;ervice. This was what was chiefly intended by the whole proce&s;s. The pri&s;oner was no &s;ooner &s;urrendered in form, than he was tied to the &s;hrouds, and received one la&s;h, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The joy of the mul|titude, who were a&s;&s;embled on the &s;hore, wait|ing with anxious &s;u&s;pen&s;e to learn what was to
<PB N="101" REF="172">
become of their unfortunate chief, is hardly to be conceived when they &s;aw him at large; they received him on his landing with open arms, and in&s;tead of re&s;enting the indignity that had been offered to the &s;econd per&s;on of the &s;tate, was rea|dy to load his per&s;ecutors with gifts, and to pro&s;|trate them&s;elves in gratitude. Nothing can be more characteri&s;tic of the pacific di&s;po&s;ition of the&s;e Friendly I&s;landers, than their behaviour on this occa&s;ion. They &s;eem to be the only people upon earth who, in principle and practice, are true Chri&s;tians. They may be truly &s;aid to love their enemies, though they never heard the pre|cepts that enjoins it.</P>
<P>Early on the 21&s;t, the king came on board, with four large hogs, and as much bread-fruit, yams, and &s;haddocks as his boat would hold, as a pre&s;ent to the Captain, for which he would take no return; but a hatchet and &s;ome beads were put into his boat, with which he returned much gratified.</P>
<P>On the 22d, [20th Cook] their warriors were all drawn up in battle array, and performed a mock-fight; but le&s;t any &s;tratagem &s;hould be in|tended, the marines were ordered to attend the engagement: nothing, however, that indicated treachery appeared. The battle was followed by a heiva, which was acknowledged by Capt. Cook, and all on board both &s;hips, to be performed with a dexterity and exactne&s;s, that far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the &s;pecimen we had given of our military ma|noeuvres.</P>
<P>On the 23d, orders were given to prepare for &s;ailing. The live &s;tock, that had been grazing, po&s;&s;ibly, on the lands of him who received the la&s;h, were got on board, wood and water were brought in plenty, the former of the be&s;t qua|lity,
<PB N="102" REF="173">
and the latter excellent. In &s;hort, nothing could exceed the accommodations of every kind, with which we were furni&s;hed in this delightful i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 25th, we unmoored and</P>
<P>On the 27th, made &s;ail in company with the Re&s;olution; but in the night, heavy &s;qualls, with thunder, lightning, and rain, to which the&s;e i&s;lands are much expo&s;ed. Many of the natives accompanied us as pa&s;&s;engers to Anamocoa.</P>
<P>On the 30th, we were employed beating to windward, and about twelve at night the Re&s;o|lution fired a gun, as a &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s. She had run a-ground on a reef, but before we could come to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he rolled off.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of June, we came in fight of the burning mountains, di&s;tance about four leagues. And, about eleven in the forenoon, moored in a fine bay. Here the natives came to us with hogs in abundance, &s;ome of which were killed and cured, but the pork &s;oon contracted a di&s;agree|able taint, which was much complained of by the &s;hips companies. While eaten fre&s;h, the meat was of an exqui&s;ite flavour.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable till the 5th, when we made &s;ail, and about five in the afternoon, the Re&s;o|lution reached Anamocoa, and moored in her old birth. Lat. 21.88. long. 185.8. but the Di&s;|covery not being able to beat up again&s;t the &s;torm, did not arrive till &s;even in the evening; when, ca&s;ting anchor &s;he drove, and in le&s;s than an hour, was three leagues to leeward of the Re&s;olution, and in the utmo&s;t danger of being wrecked. All hands were now employed in weighing up the anchor, and a number of hands came &s;ea&s;onably from the Re&s;olution to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The night was tempe&s;tuous, with a heavy rain and high &s;ea.
<PB N="103" REF="174">
Our labour, till four in the morning was ince&s;|&s;ant. We made but little way to the windward, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t exertion of our whole &s;trength. Providentially the gale &s;ub&s;ided; we &s;wayed the anchor, and before day-light was &s;afely moored by the &s;ide of the Re&s;olution. Here, though the &s;ea was rough, and we were at a great di&s;tance from &s;hore, the natives continued to trade and &s;upply us with plenty of fre&s;h provi|&s;ions, with which they kept market daily.</P>
<P>On the 8th, Feenou came on board, and gave an account of the lo&s;s of &s;everal of his people, in attempting to accompany us in their canoes from Appee; that he him&s;elf was in the utmo&s;t danger; that being over&s;et in his canoe, he was obliged to &s;wim more than two leagues; and that at la&s;t, he was miraculou&s;ly di&s;covered and taken up, by a fi&s;hing canoe on the coa&s;t of Ap|pee, when he was almo&s;t &s;pent. We expre&s;&s;ed great joy at his deliverance; and he no le&s;s, to find the &s;hips &s;afe in their former &s;tation, as he thought it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that they could weather the &s;torm. Being amply provided with every nece&s;&s;ary this i&s;land could afford,</P>
<P>On the 9th, we &s;et &s;ail for Tongataboo, or Am&s;terdam I&s;land; but in our pa&s;&s;age, both the Re&s;olution and Di&s;covery fell foul of the &s;ame rock: the Re&s;olution only touched upon it &s;light|ly; but the Di&s;covery &s;tuck fa&s;t, and hung upon it, gunnel too; happy it was, that we had day|light, and fine weather, and that the Re&s;olution was within call. By clapping the &s;ails to the ma&s;t, and lightening the &s;hip abaft, we &s;wayed her off with little damage. We were then within two leagues of Am&s;terdam; off which, in the evening, we ca&s;t anchor in &s;ix fathom water. We were in&s;tantly &s;urrounded with natives, who came
<PB N="104" REF="175">
to welcome us, and &s;eemed overjoyed at our ar|rival. It is not uncommon for voyagers, to &s;tig|matize the&s;e i&s;landers with the name of SAVAGES, than which no appellation can be wor&s;e applied, for a more civilized people does not exi&s;t under the &s;un. During our long &s;tay with them, we did not &s;ee one in&s;tance of di&s;order among them|&s;elves, nor one per&s;en puni&s;hed for any mi&s;de|meanor, by their own chiefs; we &s;aw but few quarrels among individuals. On the contrary, much mirth and &s;eeming harmony was ob&s;ervable. Highly delighted with their &s;hows and heivas, they &s;pend their time in a kind of luxurious indolence, where all but the Chiefs, labour a little, but none to exce&s;s. The Arak&eacute;, indeed, paddles him&s;elf in his canoe, though he mu&s;t have a towtow or &s;ervant to help him to eat. This &s;eems &s;trange to an European, as it reduces the man to the con|dition of a child, and yet it is but one remove from what we &s;ee daily practi&s;ed before our eyes. The gentleman has his table &s;pread, his food of various &s;orts &s;et before him; has all his appa|ratus made ready, his bread cut, his meat carved, and his plate furni&s;hed; he has his drink hand|ed to him, and in &s;hort, every thing which the tropical king has, except only conveying all tho&s;e matters to his mouth, which (tho' not the practice at the courts of European princes) the Arak&eacute; thinks nece&s;&s;ary to be done by his tow-tow. Yet the addition of this &s;ingle act of handing his meat and drink to his mouth, brings a term of re|proach upon the Arak&eacute;; though, by the handine&s;s of his &s;ervants in the &s;ervices of the table, the European gains the character of the polite gentle|man. Such and &s;o &s;lender are the di&s;tinctions in the refinements of nations; the barriers that divide &s;implicity from &s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s, and the
<PB N="105" REF="176">
plainne&s;s of the Arak&eacute; from the magnificence of the prince.</P>
<P>On the 11th, we weighed and &s;ailed in com|pany with the Re&s;olution, and moored again in Maria's Bay, one of the fine&s;t harbours in the South Seas. Here we were &s;urrounded by more than 150 canoes at once, all laden with provi|sions, or the manufactures of the country. Fee|nou, who &s;eemed to be the Emperor of the i&s;lands, [and who all along affected to be thought the real Sovereign] &s;till accompanied us. And about &s;ix leagues from this harbour had his chief re&s;i|dence. Plenty of hogs, and fowls without num|ber, were brought us, and were purcha&s;ed at &s;o cheap a rate as a hog for a hatchet, and a fowl for a nail, or a &s;tring of blue beads. Our live &s;tock were put a&s;hore upon a mo&s;t delightful lawn, where they ranged at plea&s;ure, and where their pa&s;tures were bounded by refre&s;hing &s;hades. On the little i&s;land on which they were placed to graze, a pla&s;h of water was found, which by digging was enlarged to a pond, that not only &s;upplied drink for the cattle, but water in plenty for the u&s;e of the &s;hips. In this harbour too were found every nece&s;&s;ary for repairing the da|mages the &s;hips had received in &s;triking again&s;t the rock; and here too every attention was paid us that our Commander in Chief had experienced in his former vi&s;its, of which the inhabitants had not yet lo&s;t the remembrance.</P>
<P>[On the 19th, the chiefs were a&s;&s;embled, and Capt. Cook made his mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ents. To the king he gave a young Engli&s;h bull and cow; to Feenou, a hor&s;e and mare, and to the king's father-in-law a Cape ram and two ewes.]</P>
<P>But on the 20th, an accident happened, that put the whole i&s;land in commotion. While our
<PB N="106" REF="177">
people were engaged in preparing fire-works to entertain the chiefs, two turkies, a &s;he-goat, and a peacock were &s;tolen from the Di&s;covery, and craftily carried off. They were no &s;ooner mi&s;&s;ed, than complaint was made to Feenou of this breach of ho&s;pitality, and a peremptory demand made to have them re&s;tored. Whether he was privy to the theft, and was willing to connive at it; or, what was more probable, knew not by whom it was committed, nor how readily to recover crea|tures of &s;o much curio&s;ity, which, no doubt, would be artfully concealed, he &s;eemed to make light of it, and to offer hogs and fowls in return; but this offer was rejected; and Capt. Cook being applied to, ordered the canoes about the &s;hips to be &s;eized, two chiefs that were in the &s;hip to be detained, and an order i&s;&s;ued for burning all their boats, if what was taken away were not, in four and twenty hours re&s;tored. This order being known abroad, the inhabitants a&s;&s;embled from all quarters, and in le&s;s than half a day, more than 1500 of their fighting men appeared in arms, upon the beach; in the mean time, our two Cap|tains had ordered their pinnaces out, their boats to be manned and armed, parties of marines to be put on board, and every preparation to be made, as if to carry their threats into execution. Upon their fir&s;t landing, a native i&s;&s;ued from the woods, out of breath, as if ju&s;t come from a long journey, and acquainted the Captains that he had &s;een the strange creatures, that had been taken away, at the hou&s;e of a chief, on the op|po&s;ite &s;ide of the i&s;land, whither he was ready to conduct them, if they cho&s;e to follow him.</P>
<P>Our Captain thinking this a proper opportu|nity to &s;urvey the i&s;land, accepted the offer; and accordingly &s;et out, in company with Mr. Blythe,
<PB N="107" REF="178">
Ma&s;ter of the Re&s;olution, Mr. William&s;on, Third Lieutenant, with &s;everal other gentlemen, attend|ed with a party of marines, directing their cour&s;e as the Indian led the way.</P>
<P>They had hardly been gone an hour, before &s;trong parties of natives poured down from the hills, to &s;trengthen tho&s;e that were already a&s;|&s;embled upon the beach. The Captain of ma|rines, who had charge of the boats, having drawn up his men on &s;eeing the numbers of the enemy begin to appear formidable, ordered them to fire over their heads. This they di&s;regarded, and were beginning their war-&s;ong, which always precedes their coming to action, when Capt. Cook gave Feenou to under&s;tand, that he would in&s;tant|ly de&s;troy them, if they did not that moment di&s;per&s;e. Feenou terrified by the countenance with which this threat was accompanied, ru&s;hed among the foremo&s;t ranks of the warriors, &s;eized the &s;pears of the chiefs, broke &s;everal of them, and returning, laid them at the Captain's feet. This had in part the de&s;ired effect; the i&s;landers retreated in a body, but &s;eemingly unwilling to di&s;per&s;e.</P>
<P>The Captain of marines di&s;liking the appear|ance of the enemy, made &s;igns from the &s;hore for the &s;hips to bring their broad&s;ides to bear, and at the &s;ame time drew up his men under their guns. The Commanding Officer on board the Di&s;covery improved the hint, and in&s;tantly fired &s;ome round &s;hot directly over the heads of the thicke&s;t of the enemy. This compleated what Feenou had begun; a panic &s;eized the chiefs, and the re&s;t &s;led like &s;o many &s;heep without a pur&s;uer. Capt. Clerke, ignorant of what had hap|pened, but not out of hearing of the great guns, was at a lo&s;s to determine whether to go on or to
<PB N="108" REF="179">
return; but the great guns cea&s;ing after the fir&s;t di&s;charge, he rightly concluded that, whatever might be the original cau&s;e of their firing, it did not require a &s;econd di&s;charge to remove it; he therefore re&s;olved to proceed. In his progre&s;s, the heat became almo&s;t intolerable, which was rendered &s;till more in&s;upportable by the want of water, there being none to be met with, except what was bracki&s;h.</P>
<P>After a journey of more than 12 miles, through a country inter&s;ected with numerous plantations, and where there was hardly any beaten path, he at length arrived at the re&s;idence of the Chief, whom they found fea&s;ting on a barbicued pig, a &s;tewed yam, and &s;ome bread-fruit, of which he had plenty. Surprized at the &s;ight of the Cap|tain and his attendants, and con&s;cious of their errand, he went out immediately, and produced the turkey, goat, and peacock, which he rea|dily returned, but made no apology for the theft, nor for the trouble he had given the Arak&eacute; of the &s;hips, in coming &s;o far to recover the lo&s;s.</P>
<P>On their return to the tents, they found Feenou &s;till there, who welcomed them with much &s;eem|ing &s;incerity, and began with apologizing for the conduct of his people, owing, he &s;aid, to the mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the orders from the &s;hips, which were, as they thought, to burn and de|&s;troy all without exception, men, women, and children, and to lay wa&s;te the i&s;land. He then invited Capt. Cook to accompany him a little way into an adjoining wood, with which invitation he very readily complied, and found two cocoa-nut-trees, with the branches &s;tript of their leaves and fruits, hung with yams, bread-fruit, and &s;had|docks ranged in &s;pirals curiou&s;ly inter&s;ected, and terminated each with two hogs, one ready bar|bicued,
<PB N="109" REF="180">
and one alive, which he had ordered to be prepared as pre&s;ents to the two Commanders, for which he would receive no return. The barbi|cued hog was an acceptable pre&s;ent to the people who had travelled four and twenty miles, with no other refre&s;hment than what they carried with them, except &s;ome fruit, which they gathered on the road. A party of i&s;landers were planted in readine&s;s to di&s;mantle the trees, and the boats were employed to carry their contents on board the &s;hips; and thus ended this memorable day, which, probably, will be commemorated in this i&s;land as a day of deliverance, by the late&s;t po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>[During our &s;tay here, our Commanders came to the knowledge of the <HI>real</HI> rank and cha|racters of the chiefs, who had been a&s;&s;iduous in loading them with favours. Feenou, who had affected to be thought the &s;overeign, was here deprived of his royal dignity, and Poulaho, ac|knowledged to be lord over all; there were be|&s;ides, a per&s;on of &s;upreme authority, who&s;e name was Mareewagee, and another named Toobou, who were held in high e&s;timation, and to whom the people paid implicit obedience; but &s;uperior to the&s;e la&s;t was Prince Fatafaihe, King Paulaho's &s;on. Mareewagee and old Toobou were brothers. Feenou was Mareewagee's &s;on, and King Pou|laho was his &s;on-in-law, having married his daugh|ter; &s;uch were the relation&s;hip of this royal fa|mily, who held no le&s;s than 150 i&s;lands in obe|dience, and all comprehended under the name of the Friendly I&s;lands.]</P>
<P>Here more capital thefts were committed, and more i&s;landers puni&s;hed than in all the Friendly I&s;lands be&s;ides; one was puni&s;hed with 72 la&s;hes, for only &s;tealing a knife, another with 36, for endea|vouring
<PB N="110" REF="181">
to carry off two or three drinking-gla&s;&s;es; three were puni&s;hed with 36 la&s;hes each, for heav|ing &s;tones at the wooders; but what was &s;till more cruel, a man for attempting to carry off an axe, was ordered to have his arm cut to the bone, which he bore without complaining. Capt. Cook ob&s;erves, that &s;logging &s;eemed to make no greater impre&s;&s;ion upon them than it would have done upon the main-ma&s;t. Captain Clerke hit upon a mode of treatment, which had &s;ome effect. He put them under the hands of the barber, and com|pleatly &s;haved their heads. This expo&s;ed them to the ridicule of their countrymen, and pointed them out to the guards, never to let them come near the &s;hips or tents any more.</P>
<P>It is not to be wondered, that after &s;uch wan|ton acts of cruelty, the inhabitants &s;hould grow outrageous; and though they did not break out into open acts of ho&s;tility, yet they watched every opportunity to be vexatious.</P>
<P>[On the 22d, &s;ome of the officers from both &s;hips, who had made an excur&s;ion into the inte|rior parts of the i&s;land, and had taken with them their guns, with the nece&s;&s;ary ammunition, and &s;ome other articles as pre&s;ents, had in the cour&s;e of their expedition the ill fortune to be &s;tript of every thing they had about them, by the dexterity of the natives. This had like to have been a knotty bu&s;ine&s;s. The chiefs, from what had happened before, fearing they &s;hould again be put under confinement, &s;led on the fir&s;t notice of the outrage, &s;o that there was now no chief of any authority to apply to for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Capt. Cook, having had no knowledge of the ex|cur&s;ion, (and Omai having been applied to by the &s;ufferers to &s;eek redre&s;s) was not a little di&s;plea&s;ed at Omai's taking upon him to intermeddle in an
<PB N="111" REF="182">
affair of &s;o much con&s;equence, and very &s;everely reprimanded him for his pre&s;umption. This put Omai on his metal, and being a great favourite with Feenou, he applied to him to return, and &s;ucceeded upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance of &s;afety, as Capt. Cook would not re&s;ent it, the gentlemen having made the excur&s;ion without his leave. When the chiefs returned, they urged a very plau&s;ible ar|gument for ab&s;enting them&s;elves. Had the gen|tlemen, &s;aid they, intimated to us their de&s;ire of &s;eeing the country, we would have appointed pro|per per&s;ons to have protected them, and then we &s;hould have been an&s;werable for any lo&s;&s;es they might have &s;u&s;tained; but as they acted entirely at their own ri&s;que, they mu&s;t blame them&s;elves for the con&s;equences. Though Capt. Cook gave him&s;elf no farther trouble about the matter, mo&s;t of the things were recovered, one mu&s;ket only excepted.]</P>
<P>On the 24th, one of the natives who accom|panied us on board, watched his opportunity to &s;teal a drinking ve&s;&s;el, but being catched in the act was puni&s;hed with 18 la&s;hes, to the no &s;mall diver&s;ion of his countrymen. We were now vi|&s;ited by the flux, which, however, only weaken|ed our men, but carried none off.</P>
<P>On the 19th, Mr. William&s;on and Mr. Blythe, who were fond of &s;hooting, and con&s;equently of ranging the woods and thickets, were &s;et upon by ten or twelve of the natives, who took from them their fowling-pieces and &s;hot-bags, the for|mer of which they carried off, but dropped the &s;hot-bags on being pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Recour&s;e was had to the former expedient, of &s;eizing the canoes, and threatening the i&s;land, as before; and one of the fowling-pieces was, by
<PB N="112" REF="183">
that means, recovered; but the other was never returned.</P>
<P>On the 25th, order were given to prepare for &s;ailing, the live &s;tock were taken on board, &s;o altered, that they could not have been known for the &s;ame poor &s;keletons which, two months before had been landed on the&s;e fertile &s;hores. Capt. Cook made Feenou a pre&s;ent of a hor&s;e and a mare, a bull and a cow, a ram and a ewe, for the many &s;ervices he had rendered him and his people, during their re&s;idence in the Friendly I&s;les, by which he gratified him beyond his ut|mo&s;t wi&s;hes. The&s;e valuable pre&s;ents were im|mediately driven to his palace, at Tongataboo, di&s;tant about four leagues.</P>
<P>The &s;hips being now compleatly &s;towed; hav|ing wood and water as much as they could make room for, with hogs and bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, yams, and other roots, greens in abundance, and, in &s;hort, every thing that the &s;hips could contain, or the crews de&s;ire, the boats were &s;ent out to &s;eek a pa&s;&s;age to the South-ea&s;tward, in order to vi&s;it the celebrated little i&s;land of Middleburgh, of which, former voyagers had de&s;ervedly given a mo&s;t enchanting de&s;cription.</P>
<P>On the 29th, the boats returned, having di&s;|covered a narrow gut, not half a cable's length in breadth, and from 3&frac12; to 5 fathom water, loomy bottom.</P>
<P>This day Mr. Nel&s;on, of whom mention has already been made, being alone on the hills and rocks, collecting plants and herbs indigenous to the i&s;land, and at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the &s;hips, was attacked by five or &s;ix Indians, who fir&s;t began by throwing &s;tones, at which they are very dexterous; and then, finding he had no fire-arms, clo&s;ed in with him, &s;tript him of his
<PB N="113" REF="184">
clothes and his bag, which were all that he had about him.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of July, the boats were manned, and the Captains of both &s;hips went on &s;hore, to prefer their complaints to the Arak&eacute;; but the offenders, upon enquiry, being found to be boys, and the clothes and bag of plants of &s;mall value, Mr. Nel&s;on, unwilling to embroil the inhabitants in any more di&s;putes, interceded with Capt. Cook, as we were ju&s;t upon our departure, not to make his lo&s;s an object of contention, but to take leave of the Chiefs in the mo&s;t friendly manner, who, upon the whole, had behaved with uncommon kindne&s;s and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>On the 3d, while we were getting things in readine&s;s to depart, we had an opportunity of di&s;covering the rea&s;on of a very &s;ingular mark, which was ob&s;erved by former navigators a little above the temples of many of the Chiefs. We perceived that this day was kept &s;acred throughout the whole i&s;land; that nothing was &s;uffered to be &s;old, neither did the people touch any food; and be&s;ides that, &s;everal of our new acquaintance were mi&s;&s;ing. Enquiring into the cau&s;e, we were told that Feenou's mother was dead [Poulaho's &s;on, according to Capt. Cook] and that the Chiefs, who were her de&s;cendants, &s;tayed at home to have their temples burnt. This cu&s;tom is not confined to this i&s;land only, but is likewi&s;e common to &s;e|veral others, particularly to tho&s;e of Ea-oo-wee, or Middleburgh and Appee. This mark is made on the left &s;ide on the death of a mother, and on the right when the father dies; and on the death of the high-prie&s;t, the fir&s;t joint on the little finger is amputated. [Mr. Ander&s;on &s;ays, this is done on occa&s;ions of &s;ickne&s;s. The&s;e people have an unconquerable dread of death; and when they
<PB N="114" REF="185">
think them&s;elves in danger, they hope that the Deity will accept of the little finger, as a &s;ort of &s;acrifice efficacious to procure the recovery of their health; not more probable than our Jour|nali&s;ts rea&s;on. The&s;e people had therefore their &s;uper&s;titious rites, though we were not able to di&s;cover how or when they were performed.</P>
<P>Capt. Cook gives a different rea&s;on, too, from our Journali&s;t, for the mark in the temples, which is owing, he &s;ays, on all occa&s;ions of mourn|ing, to their cu&s;tom of &s;triking their faces with their fi&s;t; but the mo&s;t extraordinary practice among them is, their beating their Chief to &s;leep with their hands. When the Chief is inclined to re&s;t, two women, one on each &s;ide, ply their palms bri&s;kly to every part of his body, and &s;o continue to do all night; and when he wakes in the morning, they help to make his kava. If he happens to wake before the &s;un ri&s;es, they then redouble their beating till he goes to &s;leep again.</P>
<P>On the 4th we unmoored, worked out of the bay, and lay in readine&s;s to take the advantage of a wind to carry us through the gut, in our way to Ea-oo-whe, or Middleburgh.</P>
<P>On the 5th, there was an eclip&s;e of the &s;un; but the weather being unfavourable, our a&s;trono|mers were rather di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>On the 7th, we cleared the gut. Being now beyond the reefs, we again ca&s;t anchor, at about three leagues di&s;tance. We had &s;carce let fall our anchors, when there came along &s;ide a large canoe, in which there were three men and a wo|men, of &s;uperior dignity to any we had yet &s;een; one of them, &s;uppo&s;ed by his venerable appear|ance, to be the high-prie&s;t, held a long pole or &s;pear in his hand, to which he tied a white flag, and began an oration which la&s;ted a con&s;iderable
<PB N="115" REF="186">
time; and after it was ended, he a&s;cended the &s;ide of the &s;hip, and &s;at down with great compo&s;ure upon the quarter-deck, till he was acco&s;ted by Capt. Clerke, who, after the u&s;ual &s;alutations, invited him and tho&s;e who accompanied him, into the great cabin; but his attendants declined the invitation; and to make known the dignity of the great per&s;onage in who&s;e pre&s;ence they were, they pro&s;trated them&s;elves before him, the women as well as the men, and touched the &s;ole of his right foot; fir&s;t with the palm, and then with the back of the hand, the u&s;ual homage paid to all the Sovereigns of the Friendly I&s;les. This aged native brought with him, as a pre&s;ent to the Cap|tain, four large hogs, &s;ix fowls, and a propor|tionable quantity of yams and plantains. In re|turn, the Captain gave him a printed gown, a Chine&s;e looking-gla&s;s, &s;ome earthen cups, and &s;everal other curio&s;ities, which he accepted with great courte&s;y, and with an air of dignity which remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed him.</P>
<P>The Captain and officers paid him great atten|tion, and &s;hewed him the different accommoda|tions on board the &s;hip, at which he expre&s;&s;ed great a&s;toni&s;hment. He was then invited to eat, which he declined. He was offered wine, of which the Captain drank fir&s;t; he put it to his lips, ta&s;ted it, but returned the gla&s;s. After be|ing on board little more than an hour, he was de|&s;irous of taking leave, and pointed to a little i&s;land, to which he gave the Captain a very pre&s;&s;ing invi|tation to accompany him; but that could not be complied with, as the &s;hips were every moment expected to &s;ail. This venerable per&s;on was about &s;ix feet three inches high, finely proportioned, and had a commanding air, that was both affable and graceful.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="187">On the 8th Feenou came on board the Re&s;olu|tion, to take his final leave: he brought with him five hogs, with a large proportion of yams and fruit. He te&s;tified his grief at parting, with all that appearance of &s;incerity that characterizes the people of the&s;e happy i&s;lands.</P>
<P>On the 9th we weighed, and on the 12th ca&s;t anchor, on the S. W. &s;ide of the i&s;land of Ea-oo-whe, or Middleburgh, where the people came on board with as little ceremony as if they had been acquainted with us for many years. [Indeed, Capt. Cook was no &s;tranger there; for Taoofor, their chief, had been his <HI>tayo,</HI> or bo&s;om friend, when he was at this i&s;land in his former voyage.] They brought us the produce of the i&s;land; but being already &s;upplied with every nece&s;&s;ary of that kind, our chief traffic was for birds and feathers. Here the parrots and paroquets were of the mo&s;t beautiful plumage, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e u&s;ually imported into Europe from the Indies; there were a great variety of other birds, on which many gentlemen in both &s;hips &s;et a great value, though they were purcha&s;ed for trifles. The feathers we purcha&s;ed were of divers colours for the northern market, but chiefly red from the Marque&s;as and Society I&s;les. We al&s;o purcha&s;ed cloth, and many other articles of curious workman&s;hip, the arti&s;ts of this i&s;land, for invention and ingenuity in the execution, exceeding tho&s;e of all the other i&s;lands in the South Seas. But what chiefly tended to prolong our &s;tay here, was the richne&s;s of the gra&s;s, which made into hay, proved excellent food for our live &s;tock. From the accounts cir|culated through the &s;hip when we arrived, it was generally believed, that we might travel through this i&s;land with our pockets open, provided they were not lined with iron; but to this, the beha|viour
<PB N="117" REF="188">
of a party of the inhabitants, to William Collet, Captain's Steward of the Di&s;covery, was an exception. Being alone, diverting him&s;elf in &s;urveying the country, he was &s;et upon and &s;tript of every thing he had about him, his &s;hoes only excepted, and on preferring his complaint, his keys were all that he was able to recover.</P>
<P>[Here Capt. Cook, while the cattle that were re&s;erved were grazing, made an excur&s;ion into the heart of the country, where the hills ro&s;e to a great height, from whence torrents of rain in the rainy &s;ea&s;on are poured down to the &s;ea. While he was ab&s;ent, one of the natives, in the circle where our people traded, &s;truck one of their countrymen with a club, which laid bare, if not fractured his &s;kull, and then broke his thigh with, the &s;ame weapon, before our men could interpo&s;e. He had no &s;igns of life when carried off, but af|terwards revived a little. His crime was, being caught in the fact with a better man's wife than him&s;elf. She, it &s;eems, was only to have a &s;light beating.]</P>
<P>On the 18th, [17th, Cook] orders were given to prepare for &s;ailing: and Otaheite was appointed our place of rendezvous, in ca&s;e of &s;eparation. We had now been near three months improving our live &s;tock, wooding, watering, repairing our &s;hips, and laying in fre&s;h provi&s;ions in the&s;e friendly i&s;lands, when the above orders were i&s;|&s;ued out. The crews of both &s;hips received the&s;e orders with alacrity; for though they wanted for nothing, yet they longed to be at Otaheite, where many of them had formed connections that were dear to them; and where tho&s;e, who had not yet been there, had conceived &s;o high an idea of its &s;uperiority, as to make them look upon every
<PB N="118" REF="189">
other place they touched at as an uncultivated garden, in compari&s;on with that little Eden.</P>
<P>[Ju&s;t before we &s;et &s;ail, Omai was offered the Sovereignty of the place; and would gladly have accepted of it, had Capt. Cook approved of it; but he did not; for what rea&s;on does not appear.]</P>
<P>We found the be&s;t articles for traffic at the&s;e i&s;lands; iron tools in general, axes and hatchets; nails, from the large&s;t &s;pike down to tenpenny ones; razors, files, and knives, are much &s;ought after; red cloth, and linen both white and co|loured; looking-gla&s;&s;es and beads are al&s;o in e&s;ti|mation, but of the latter tho&s;e that are blue are preferred to all others, and white ones are thought the lea&s;t valuable. A &s;tring of large blue beads would at any time purcha&s;e a hog.</P>
<P>In return for the&s;e, all refre&s;hments may be had, &s;uch as hogs, fowls, fi&s;h, yams, bread-fruit, plantains, cocoa nuts, &s;ugar-cane, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>It may be expected, &s;ays Capt. Cook, that after &s;pending between two or three months among them, I &s;hould be enabled to clear up every difficulty, and to give a &s;atisfactory account of their cu&s;toms, opinions, and in&s;titutions, both civil and religious; e&s;pecially as we had a per&s;on on board, who might be &s;uppo&s;ed qualified to act the part of an interpreter, by under&s;tanding their language and ours; but poor Omai was very de|ficient; for unle&s;s the object or thing we wanted to enquire about was actually before us, we found it difficult to gain any tolerable knowledge of it from information only, without falling into a hundred mi&s;takes: and to &s;uch mi&s;takes Omai was more liable than we were. For having no curio&s;ity to gratify, he never gave him&s;elf the trouble to make remarks for him&s;elf; and when he was de&s;ired to explain matters to us, his ideas
<PB N="119" REF="190">
appeared to be &s;o limited, and perhaps &s;o different from ours, that his accounts were often &s;o con|fu&s;ed as to perplex in&s;tead of in&s;tructing us. Add to this, that it was very rare that we found among the natives a per&s;on who united the ability and inclination to give us the information we wanted, and we found that mo&s;t of them hated to be troubled with what they probably thought idle que&s;tions. Our &s;ituation at Tongataboo, where we staid longe&s;t, was likewi&s;e unfavourable. It was in a part of the country where there were few inhabitants, except fi&s;hers. It was always holy|day with our vi&s;itors, as well as with tho&s;e we vi&s;ited; &s;o that we had but few opportunities of ob&s;erving what was really the dome&s;tic way of living among the natives. Under the&s;e di&s;advan|tages, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that we &s;hould not be able to bring away any &s;ati&s;factory accounts of many things; but &s;ome of us endeavoured to remedy the&s;e di&s;advantages by diligent ob&s;erva|tion. Tho&s;e mo&s;t worthy of notice re&s;pected the pains taken to obtain an adequate knowledge of their religious notions: the rigid &s;everity with which their mourning and other ceremonies are performed, would induce a belief that they meant thereby to &s;ecure to them&s;elves a felicity beyond the grave; but of this they &s;eem to have no con|ception; all their views are temporal, and all their prayers directed to avert the evils of this life. The &s;upreme Author of mo&s;t things, they call Kallafoetonga, who they &s;ay is a female, re|&s;iding in the &s;ky, and directing the thunder, wind, rain, and, in general, all the phaenomena of na|ture. They believe that when &s;he is angry, the productions of the earth are bla&s;ted; that they them&s;elves are afflicted with di&s;ea&s;es and death; and that nothing pro&s;pers that they undertake.
<PB N="120" REF="191">
They have great faith in their endeavours to ap|pea&s;e this Deity; and for that purpo&s;e all their rites and ceremonies are directed. They have, however, &s;ome imperfect notions of the immate|riality and immortality of the &s;oul; and a&s;&s;ign their heroes and chiefs &s;eats above the clouds, where, when they arrive, they are to live for ever. They have, like the Heathens, a plurality of gods; but we do not find, that, like the ancient patriarchs, they carry any of their gods about with them. They believe in good and bad &s;pirits, inhabitants of air, earth, and water, who never are &s;een, but who&s;e power are made apparent by their effects.</P>
<P>Whatever their plan of government may be, it &s;eems general throughout the friendly i&s;lands; and it is certain, that no people upon earth appear to be better regulated. The &s;ubordination, how humiliating &s;oever it may be, is &s;ubmitted to without a murmur. No di&s;content appeared among the inferior cla&s;&s;es of the people, during the three months the &s;hips continued among them; and it was ob&s;ervable, that the jealou&s;ies, if any, originated among the Chiefs; the common people were all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They do not offer up human &s;acrifices to their Deities, as they do in the Society I&s;les; neither was any animal whatever &s;lain for that purpo&s;e, while the &s;hips remained at any of the friendly ports.</P>
<P>The burials of their Chiefs and their mournings, are very &s;olemn and univer&s;al; and they have days &s;et apart for ab&s;tinence from food and labour; but no &s;abbath, or periodical a&s;&s;emblies for the celebration of divine wor&s;hip. Their burying-places indeed are con&s;ecrated, and they have prie&s;ts who are principals in all their ceremonies.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="192">Such are the imperfect outlines of their devo|tions, and &s;uch is the &s;imple plan of their go|vernment; regulated by no written laws, but &s;ub|ject to correction as a child to its parent, and, upon all &s;olemn or nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, called upon in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>At &s;ix in the morning we weighed, Capt. Cook having fir&s;t given the Cape Ram and two Ewes to Taoofa, they having been &s;lighted by Maveewa|gee, and re&s;erved for the pre&s;ent Chiefs, who promi&s;ed to take great care of them, and where there was a great chance of their propagating, as there were no dogs on the i&s;land. We were &s;oon under &s;ail, &s;teering our cour&s;e to the Southward, to fetch a wind to carry us to our intended port.</P>
<P>On the 19th we were out of &s;ight of land, when in lat. 22.24. S. the wind &s;hifting fair W. N. W. with hard gales, which continuing for &s;everal days,</P>
<P>On the 23d we found our &s;hip leaky, and no po&s;&s;ibility of &s;topping her leaks till we could make land. All hands were employed in pumping out the water, and when we found it did not increa&s;e upon us, the leak gave us little or no concern.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable till the 29th, when in lat. 28.7. the weather became tempe&s;tuous, and a &s;udden &s;quall carried away our main-top and top-gallant ma&s;ts, &s;plit our main-&s;ail, and carried away the jib. It is a&s;toni&s;hing to &s;ee with what &s;pirit and alacrity Engli&s;h &s;ailors exert them&s;elves. Amid&s;t a &s;torm, when it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a land&s;man to tru&s;t him&s;elf upon deck, our &s;ailors mounted aloft, and with incredible rapidity cleared away the wreck, by which they pre&s;erved the &s;hip. Nothing equal to this di&s;a&s;ter had befallen us be|fore in the cour&s;e of the voyage. During the night we hoi&s;ted lights and fired guns of di&s;tre&s;s, but neither were &s;een nor heard by the Re&s;olution.
<PB N="122" REF="193">
The &s;torm continuing with unabated fury during the night and all next day, we handed our &s;ails, and &s;cudded under our fore-&s;ail and mizen &s;tay-&s;ail, at the rate of &s;even and eight knots an hour, and at length were obliged to lie-to with our &s;hip's head to the We&s;t, cour&s;e E. N. E.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, we got fight of the Re&s;olution, about four leagues to leeward. She had damaged her main-top-ma&s;t head, but had &s;ecured it, and was otherwi&s;e in perfect repair. Lat. 28.4. long. 199.41.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t the 1&s;t, we celebrated the anniver&s;ary of our departure from England, having ju&s;t been one year ab&s;ent. The men were allowed a double allowance of grog, and they forgot, in the jollity of their cups, the hard&s;hips to which they were expo&s;ed in the &s;torm.</P>
<P>On the 2d, our carpenters were employed in replacing the old top-ma&s;t with a new one; but ju&s;t as they had got it in readine&s;s to point the ba&s;e of the top-ma&s;t through the main-top, they di&s;covered, to our un&s;peakable grief, that the main-ma&s;t head was &s;hattered four or five feet below the top. This put an end to our labour at this time. The top-ma&s;t was lowered till the main-ma&s;t could be &s;ecured, which was a work of infinite difficulty in our &s;ituation, and could not be accompli&s;hed without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the carpenters from the Re&s;olution. The &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s was thrown out, but the &s;ea ran &s;o high that no boat could live. In this &s;ituation we con|tinued till the &s;torm abated, when the ma&s;t being la&s;hed, a &s;pare jib-boom was got up for a main-top-ma&s;t, and a mizen top-&s;ail yard for a top-&s;ail yard; and thus equipped, we made what &s;ail we could, the Re&s;olution &s;hortening &s;ail to keep us company.

<P><PB N="123" REF="194">In this crazy condition, with our leaks rather increa&s;ed, we met with a &s;torm</P>
<P>On the 3d, which required the utmo&s;t exertion of our &s;trength to encounter, every hand in the &s;hip was employed, &s;ome at the pumps, and others in handing the &s;ails, which was a work of the greate&s;t danger, yet happily accompli&s;hed without any accident.</P>
<P>On the 8th, at &s;ix in the evening, the man at the ma&s;t-head called out, Land, which was joyful news to all on board, and about &s;even we &s;tood in for it. About eleven we &s;aw &s;everal canoes, pad|dling towards the &s;hips, in each of which were three naked Indians. We made &s;igns for them to come on board, which they declined, but made &s;igns for us to land. Our boats were in&s;tantly hoi&s;ted out, and &s;ent to &s;ound, but no anchorage being found, it was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue our voyage, with|out lo&s;ing any more time. This i&s;land [Toobouai] was a new di&s;covery. Its latitude, by ob&s;ervation, 23.25. long. 210.37. E. The men appeared of the large&s;t &s;tature, tattowed from head to foot; the language different from any we were yet ac|quainted with; and their dre&s;s nothing but a piece of matting round the wai&s;t, like that of the Am|&s;terdamers; their complexion darker, their heads ornamented with &s;hells, feathers, and flowers; and their canoes elegantly carved, and neatly con|&s;tructed. Of their manners we could form little or no judgment. They appeared timid; but by their waving green boughs, and exhibiting other &s;igns of peace, they gave us rea&s;on to believe that they were friendly. They exchanged &s;ome &s;mall fi&s;h and cocoa-nuts, for nails and Middleburgh cloth. The appearance of the i&s;land, as we ap|proached it, was lofty, but &s;mall. Its greate&s;t

length about four leagues, and its breadth about two leagues.</P>
<P>We now proceeded with an ea&s;y breeze, till</P>

<P>The 13th, the man at the ma&s;t-head called out, Land, di&s;tant about &s;even or eight leagues; we &s;oon perceived it to be the i&s;land of Otaheite, of which we were in pur&s;uit. Lat. 17.44.</P>
<P>On the 14th, about &s;ix in the morning, we &s;tood in for the land, and before night were &s;afely moored in the harbour called by the natives, Oheite Peeha. Here we were &s;urrounded by an incredible number of canoes filled with natives, be&s;ides men, women, and children, who &s;wam to the &s;hips, expre&s;&s;ing their joy at our arrival. We were &s;carce moored before a Chief, named Ootee, came on board the Re&s;olution, to welcome Capt. Cook. He was attended by Omai's brother-in-law, who took little or no notice of Omai, till taking him down into the cabin, and &s;hewing him his trea&s;ure of red feathers, and giving him a few, the news of his riches pre&s;ently &s;pread, and Ootee, who would &s;carce &s;peak to him before, now begged that they might be <HI>tayo's,</HI> and exchange names. Omai accepted the honour, and made him a pre|&s;ent of &s;ome red feathers, and Ootee, by way of return, &s;ent a-&s;hore for a hog. 'Twas vi&s;ible to all on board, that it was not the man but the red feathers, that was of con&s;equence.</P>
<P>They were now eager to enter into conver&s;ation with Omai, and informed Capt&s; Cook, through his means, of the arrival in that port of two Spa|ni&s;h &s;hips from Lima, who had twice vi&s;ited them: that at their departure, the fir&s;t time, they had taken four of the natives with them, and had left four of their people in their room; two prie&s;ts, a &s;er|vant, and a per&s;on named Mateema, who was
<PB N="125" REF="196">
highly &s;poken of by the natives: That they had built a hou&s;e on &s;hore, and erected a cro&s;s, with an in&s;cription, which were &s;till &s;tanding; that they had left &s;ome cattle, with goats, &s;heep, and gee&s;e; but that mo&s;t of them were dead: that they promi&s;ed to return &s;oon, which they did, and brought two of the natives back, the other two having died at Lima; and that they had taken their own people back, but had left their hou&s;e &s;tanding.</P>
<P>Dinner was no &s;ooner over, than both Captains, accompanied by Omai, went on &s;hore, and vi&s;ited the Spani&s;h erections; which &s;eemed to indicate a deeper de&s;ign than the natives were aware of; they had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the i&s;land, in the name of his Catholic Maje&s;ty, and had in&s;cribed the cro&s;s with the King's name, Carolus III. imperat. 1774, which Capt. Cook took the liberty to de|face, and on the other &s;ide of the po&s;t cau&s;ed the following memorial to be in&s;cribed: Georgius Tertius Rex, Annis 1767, 1769, 1773, 1774, 1777. Here the natives pointed out to them the grave of the Commodore, who died there while the &s;hips lay in the bay, the fir&s;t time. Mo&s;t of the fre&s;h provi&s;ions with which we were &s;upplied at the Friendly I&s;les, being expended in the voy|age, orders were given to prohibit all trade with the natives, except for provi&s;ions, and that only with &s;uch per&s;ons as were appointed by the Com|manders as purveyors for the &s;hips. By this ne|ce&s;&s;ary regulation, fre&s;h provi&s;ions were &s;oon pro|cured in plenty, and every man was allowed a pound and a half of pork every day. On this day, the crews of both &s;hips were made acquainted with the cour&s;e they were to &s;teer, and the reward to which they &s;hould be entitled by act of parlia|ment, &s;hould they di&s;cover a communication be|tween
<PB N="126" REF="197">
the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean; and al&s;o, if they &s;hould &s;ail beyond the 89th degree of Northern latitude. At the &s;ame time, it was left to their choice to &s;hare the u&s;ual allowance of grog, now, or re&s;erve it till they &s;hould come to the cold regions of the North, when double allow|ance would probably be nece&s;&s;ary. The crews of both &s;hips were unanimous for giving up their grog, and &s;ub&s;tituting the milk of the cocoa-nut in its room.</P>
<P>On the 14th, Omai was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e the Spaniards had built; his bed put up in it after the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion; and he was indulged to &s;leep on &s;hore, during our &s;hort &s;tay at this part of the i&s;land. Here al&s;o the live &s;tock were landed, and put to graze in the meadows that bordered on the &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 16th, Capt. Cook, with Omai, took an airing, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of the inhabi|tants, many hundreds or whom followed them with loud acclamations. Omai, to excite their admiration the more, was dre&s;&s;ed cap-a-pee in a &s;uit of armour, which he carried with him, and was mounted and capari&s;oned with his &s;word and pike, like St. George accoutred to kill the dragon; only that in&s;tead of a long &s;word, Omai had pi&s;tols hung to his girdle, which he &s;ometimes made good u&s;e of, when the crowd became trouble&s;ome, to drive them &s;uddenly away.</P>
<P>The chief of this part of the i&s;land, a minor, being ab&s;ent when the &s;hips arrived, the news had been rapidly conveyed to him, and he was ju&s;t returned, as the &s;hips were preparing to depart. Word was brought on board the Re&s;o|lution, that young Waheindooa, for that was the name of the chief, wanted to &s;ee Capt. Cook, and accordingly, the Captain and Omai went on &s;hore
<PB N="127" REF="198">
to pay, as was cu&s;tomary, the fir&s;t vi&s;it. They were received with form. The chiefs were all a&s;|&s;embled; Capt. Cook was informed of the er|rand of the Spaniards to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their i&s;land; but they were ready to make a formal &s;urrender of it to Capt. Cook. In confirmation of this grant, the young Prince was de&s;ired to pay homage to the Captain, and to embrace him.</P>
<P>This ceremony ended, Omai, who had prepared a <HI>maro,</HI> compo&s;ed of red and yellow feathers, which he intended for Otoo, king of the whole i&s;land, was fool enough to pre&s;ent it to Waheiadooa, to be by him forwarded to Otoo. He thought by this management to have &s;ecured the favour of both; but the contrary was the effect, for the mo&s;t valuable part of the pre&s;ent was kept be|hind, and not a 20th part was pre&s;ented to Otoo. The fir&s;t did not thank him, and the latter took it as an affront. Some pre&s;ents pa&s;&s;ed between the Captains and the Chiefs; and while the live &s;tock was grazing, the Commanders and officers em|ployed their lei&s;ure time in &s;urveying the i&s;land. In their walks, &s;ome officers di&s;covered what they thought a Romi&s;h chapel; but what Capt. Cook afterwards found to be a <HI>toopapaoo,</HI> or &s;acred re|po&s;itory, where the remains of old Waheiadooa lay in &s;tate. It was uncommonly neat, and had two prie&s;ts as attendants.</P>
<P>For the&s;e la&s;t two or three days, the caulkers from both &s;hips were employed, in &s;topping the leaks of the Di&s;covery; and the carpenters in &s;ecuring the ma&s;ts, till we &s;hould arrive at the port of Mattavai, where the &s;hips were to undergo a thorough repair.</P>
<P>On the 18th and 19th it blew a hard gale, and we were obliged to veer out 20 fathom more of
<PB N="128" REF="199">
our be&s;t bower cable for &s;afety, as we rode hard at our moorings.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, the &s;ignal was made for un|mooring.</P>
<P>Early on the 22d, in the morning, the live &s;tock, were taken on board, and about nine we weighed and &s;ailed, accompanied with &s;everal canoes, though the wind blew a &s;torm, and we &s;ailed under the double-reefed top-&s;ails. In the evening, the Re&s;olution took her old &s;tation in Mattavai Bay: but the wind &s;uddenly &s;hifting, and the breeze coming full from the land, we were driven three leagues to leeward of the bay; by which we were reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of working all night to windward, amid&s;t thun|der, lightning, and rain, and among reefs of coral rocks, on which we every moment expected to peri&s;h. We burnt fal&s;e fires, and fired &s;everal guns of di&s;tre&s;s; but no an&s;wer from the Re&s;o|lution, nor could we &s;ee any object to direct us during this perilous night.</P>
<P>Before our departure, one of their Eatooas, or prophe&s;ying prie&s;ts, had prophe&s;ied, that we &s;hould not land at Mattavai that day. The&s;e impo&s;tors are held in great e&s;teem through all the Friendly I&s;lands, and this accident, though it might have been ea&s;ily fore&s;een, increa&s;ed their veneration.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 23d, however, the wea|ther cleared up, and we could &s;ee the Re&s;olution about three leagues to windward, when a &s;hift of wind happening in our favour, we took advan|tage of it, and by twelve at noon were &s;afely moored within a cable's length of the Re&s;olution. It is impo&s;&s;ible to give an adequate idea of the joy, which the natives expre&s;&s;ed upon our arrival in this bay, becau&s;e their manner of expre&s;&s;ing joy is
<PB N="129" REF="200">
&s;o different from our &s;en&s;ations, that were we to &s;ee per&s;ons &s;tabbing them&s;elves with &s;harp in&s;tru|ments till their bodies were be&s;meared with blood, we &s;hould think they were pierced with the mo&s;t frantic de&s;pair, and that it would be almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;uage their grief; whereas here, beat|ing their brea&s;ts, tearing their hair, and prick|ing their heads, their hands, and their bodies, are the mo&s;t &s;ignificant &s;igns of their gladne&s;s to &s;ee the friends they love be&s;t. At the &s;ame time they are ready to overwhelm you with kindne&s;s, and would give you, for the moment, all they have in the world; but the very next hour crave all back again, and like children teize you for every think you have got be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The &s;hips were no &s;ooner &s;ecured, than the &s;ailors began &s;tripping them of every yard of rigging they had left; for certainly no &s;hips were ever in a more &s;hattered condition. Our voyage from New Zealand, if not from the Cape, might be &s;aid to be one continued &s;eries of tempe&s;tuous weather, &s;u&s;pended only by a few intervals of &s;un-&s;hine; and the employment of our artificers at &s;ea and on &s;hore, a laborious exertion of their umo&s;t &s;kill to keep us above wa|ter. Here it was not only nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trip the main-ma&s;t of the Di&s;covery, but to take it out and carry it on &s;hore, to be properly &s;ecured. This was a work of no &s;mall difficulty. Here too it was found nece&s;&s;ary, to un&s;hip our &s;tores of every kind; to air and unpack the powder; new-bake that part of the bread that had con|tracted any dampne&s;s; to erect the forge on &s;hore; and in &s;hort, to &s;et all our artificers to work on board and on &s;hore, to refit the &s;hips for the fur|ther pro&s;ecution of the voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="201">A me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched from Capt. Cook to King Ottoo, to acquaint him with our arrival, and to de&s;ire his permi&s;&s;ion to &s;end the cattle we had brought from Britain, to feed in the pa&s;tures of Opparree. The king expre&s;&s;ed his joy on the return of Capt. Cook, and readily gave his con|&s;ent. He at the &s;ame time ordered one of his principal officers to accompany the me&s;&s;enger in his return, and to take with him pre&s;ents of fre&s;h provi&s;ions for the Commanders of both &s;hips, and to invite them on &s;hore, to dine with him the next day. This invitation was accepted, and it was agreed between the Captains, that their vi&s;it &s;hould be made with as much &s;tate as their pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances would admit. The marines and mu&s;ic were therefore ordered to be in readi|ne&s;s at an appointed hour, and all the rowers to be clean dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the 25th, about noon, the commanders, with the principal officers and gentlemen, em|barked on board the pinnaces, which, on this occa&s;ion, were dre&s;&s;ed with all their decorations. Omai, to &s;urprize the more, was clothed in a Captain's uniform, and could hardly be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by any of the multitude then a&s;&s;embled from a Briti&s;h officer.</P>
<P>From Mattavai to Opparree, was about three miles. They arrived at the landing-place about one o'clock in the afternoon, and were received by the marines already under arms. As &s;oon as the company were di&s;embarked, the whole band of mu&s;ic &s;truck up a grand military march, and the proce&s;&s;ion began. The road from the beach to the entrance of the palace (about half a mile) was lined on both &s;ides with natives from all parts, expecting to &s;ee Omai on hor&s;eback, as
<PB N="131" REF="202">
the account of his appearance on his fir&s;t landing on the other &s;ide of the i&s;land, had already reach|ed the inhabitants of this. As he appeared to them in di&s;gui&s;e, he was not known; they were not however wholly di&s;appointed, as the grandeur of the proce&s;&s;ion exceeded every thing of the kind they had ever &s;een. The whole court were likewi&s;e a&s;&s;embled, and the king, with his &s;i&s;ters, on the approach of Capt. Cook, came forth to meet him. As he was perfectly known to them, their fir&s;t &s;alutations were frank and friendly, ac|cording to the known cu&s;toms of the Otaheiteans; and when the&s;e &s;alutations were over, proper at|tention was paid to every gentleman in com|pany; and that too with a politene&s;s that, to tho&s;e who had never been on this i&s;land before, was quite unexpected.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the company had entered the pa|lace and were &s;eated, and &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed between the king and Capt. Cook, Omai was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty. He had hitherto e&s;caped unnoticed, with the other inferior officers who were not particularly known. Omai paid his Maje&s;ty the u&s;ual homage of a &s;ubject to a &s;overeign in that country, which was kneeling and embracing his foot, and then entered into fa|miliar conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of his travels. The Earees, or kings, of this country, are not above di&s;cour&s;ing with the meane&s;t of their &s;ub|jects, but Omai was now con&s;idered here as a per&s;on of rank, and a favourite of the Earees of the &s;hips. The king having received from him a valuable pre&s;ent, was de&s;irous to hear his &s;tory, and a&s;ked him &s;everal que&s;tions before he gave him time to an&s;wer one. At length Omai began by magnifying the grandeur of the Great King; he compared the &s;plendor of his court to the bril|liancy
<PB N="132" REF="203">
of the &s;tars in the firmament; the extent of his dominions by the va&s;t expan&s;e of heaven; the greatne&s;s of his power, by the thunder that &s;hakes the earth. He &s;aid, the Great King of Pretanne had three hundred thou&s;and warriors every day at his command, clothed like tho&s;e who now attended the Earees of the &s;hips, and more than double that number of &s;ailors, who traver&s;|ed the globe, from the ri&s;ing of the fun to his &s;etting; that his &s;hips of war exceeded tho&s;e at Mattavai in magnitude, in the &s;ame proportion, as tho&s;e exceeded the &s;mall canoes at Opparree.&mdash;His Maje&s;ty appeared all a&s;toni&s;hment, and could not help interrupting him. He a&s;ked, if what he &s;aid was true, Where the Great King could find people to navigate &s;o many &s;hips as covered the ocean from one extremity to the other? and if he could find men, where he could find provi|&s;ions for &s;o great a multitude? Omai a&s;&s;ured him, that he had &s;poken nothing but truth; that in one city only on the banks of a river far removed from the &s;ea, there were more people than were contained in the whole group of i&s;lands with which his Maje&s;ty was acquainted; that the country was full of large populous cities; notwith&s;tand|ing which provi&s;ions were &s;o plentiful, that for a piece of certain yellow metal, like that of which he had &s;een many [meaning the medals given by the Captain to the Earees] the Great King could purcha&s;e as much provi&s;ions as would maintain a &s;ailor on board a &s;hip a whole year; that in the country of the Great King, there are more than 100 different kinds of four-footed animals, from the &s;ize of the &s;malle&s;t rat when it is fir&s;t brought forth, to the magnitude of a &s;tage erected on an ordinary canoe, on which &s;ix men may &s;tand erect; that all the&s;e animals are &s;o numerous in
<PB N="133" REF="204">
their &s;everal kinds, and propagate &s;o fa&s;t, that were it not that &s;ome were killed for food, and that others prey one upon the other, they would over-run the land: Omai, having by this rela|tion obviated king Ottoo's doubts, adverted to his fir&s;t que&s;tions. He &s;aid, the &s;hips of war of Pretanne were furni&s;hed with poo-poos [guns] each of which would receive the large&s;t poo-poo his Maje&s;ty had yet &s;een within it; that &s;ome carried 100 and more of tho&s;e poo-poos, with &s;uitable accommodations for a thou&s;and fighting men, and &s;towage for all &s;orts of cordage and war|like &s;tores, be&s;ides provi&s;ions and water for the men and other animals, for 100 or 200 days; and that they were &s;ometimes abroad as long warring with the enemies of the Great King in the diffe|rent parts of his dominions in the remote&s;t parts of the earth; that they frequently carried with them in the&s;e expeditions poo-poos, that would hold a &s;mall hog within them, and which throw hol|low globes of iron, of a va&s;t bigne&s;s, filled with fire and all manner of combu&s;tibles, and imple|ments of de&s;truction, to a great di&s;tance; a few of which, were they to be thrown among the fleet of Otaheite, would &s;et them on fire, and de|&s;troy the whole navy, in le&s;s than half a day, were they ever &s;o numerous. The king &s;eemed more a&s;toni&s;hed than delighted with what he &s;aid, and &s;uddenly left Omai, to join the company that were in conver&s;ation with Capt. Cook and the other officers.</P>
<P>After the hurry of the vi&s;it was over, we were conducted to the water-&s;ide in the &s;ame manner as we approached the palace, and were attended by the king and mo&s;t of the chiefs.</P>
<P>Soon after our arrival, one of the natives, who had been at Lima, came and vi&s;ited us. He re|tained
<PB N="134" REF="205">
a few Spani&s;h words which he had learnt at Lima, and <HI>Si Senore,</HI> was as ready on all oc|ca&s;ions, as was, <HI>if you plea&s;e Sir,</HI> or, <HI>as you plea&s;e Sir,</HI> with Oedidee, who had formerly accompa|nied Capt. Cook in a &s;even months voyage, in which he had vi&s;ited the Friendly I&s;lands, New Zealand, Ea&s;ter I&s;land, and the Marqu&s;es. The&s;e two were our con&s;tant vi&s;itors while the &s;hips &s;tayed, and afforded a good deal of diver&s;ion to the crews.</P>
<P>On the 25th in the morning, Omai's mother, and &s;everal of his relations arrived. Their meet|ing was too unnatural to be plea&s;ing. We eould not &s;ee a woman frantically &s;triking her face and arms with &s;harks teeth, till &s;he was all over be|&s;meared with blood, without being hurt. As it conveyed no idea of joy to feeling minds, we could never be reconciled to this ab&s;urd cu&s;tom. She brought with her &s;everal large hogs, with bread-fruit, bananos, and other productions of the I&s;land of Ulitea, as pre&s;ents to the Captains; and &s;he and her friends received in return, a great variety of cutlery, &s;uch as knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, files, &amp;c be&s;ides &s;ome red feathers, which la&s;t were even more acceptable than iron. They conti|nued to vi&s;it the &s;hip occa&s;ionally till we quitted the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Before noon king Ottoo, with his chiefs and attendants, and two young prince&s;&s;es his &s;i&s;ters, came on board, followed by &s;everal canoes, laden with provi&s;ions &s;ufficient to have &s;erved both &s;hips a week. They were entertained as u&s;ual, with a &s;ight of all the curio&s;ities on board the &s;hips, and the young prince&s;&s;es, longing for almo&s;t every thing they &s;aw, were gratified to their utmo&s;t wi&s;hes, with bracelets of beads, looking-gla&s;&s;es, bits of china, artificial no&s;egays, and a variety
<PB N="135" REF="206">
of other trinkets, of which they had one of a &s;ort each, while at the &s;ame time the king and his chiefs amu&s;ed them&s;elves with the carpenters, ar|mourers and other artificers, employed in the re|pairs of the &s;hips, ca&s;ting longing eyes on the tools and implements with which they perform|ed their work. In this manner they pa&s;t the time till dinner was ready. King Ottoo, with his chiefs, dined with the Captains, the principal of|ficers, and Omai in the great cabin, while the ladies were fea&s;ted in an apartment &s;eparated on purpo&s;e, and waited upon by their own &s;ervants. During dinner, the mu&s;ic, particularly the bag-pipes, with which the Ottaheiteans &s;eemed mo&s;t delighted, continued to play, and the young la|dies who were within hearing, though out of &s;ight, could hardly refrain from dancing the whole time. After dinner the king and his chiefs were pre&s;|&s;ed to drink wine; but mo&s;t of them having felt its power before, declined ta&s;ting it; one or two drank a gla&s;s, but refu&s;ed to drink any more.</P>
<P>What contributed not a little to increa&s;e the plea&s;ure of the king, was a pre&s;ent made him by Capt. Cook, of a large quantity of the choice&s;t red feathers that could be purcha&s;ed in the i&s;lands of Am&s;terdam. Red feathers, as has already been ob&s;erved, are held in the highe&s;t e&s;tima|tion in Otaheite, where, when the &s;hips fir&s;t ar|rived, a quantity of them, not greater than might be got from a tom-tit, would have purcha&s;ed a hog; but every &s;ailor being furni&s;hed with them, they &s;unk 500 per cent. in value. They are here u&s;ed as amulets, or rather as propitiations to make their prayers acceptable to the good &s;pirit whom they invoke with tufts of tho&s;e feathers in their hands, made up in a peculiar manner, and held in a certain po&s;ition with much &s;eeming &s;o|lemnity.
<PB N="136" REF="207">
Of this Capt. Cook was an eye-witne&s;s, when he went afterwards to be pre&s;ent at a hu|man &s;acrifice, of which two were offered up while we lay moored in the harbour of Mattavai. In the cour&s;e of Capt. Cook's former voyage, the name of Towha frequently occurrs, as Admiral in Chief of the naval force of Otaheite.</P>
<P>From this chief, on the 1&s;t of September, a me&s;&s;enger arrived at Oparree with advice that he had killed a man, to be &s;acrificed to the Eatooa, to implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that god again&s;t Eimea; and to require the pre&s;ence of king Ottoo at the ceremony, without which it could not be perform|ed. This horrid rite was to be &s;olemnized in con&s;equence of a war which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome years between the I&s;land of Otaheite and that of Eimea, and which was now come to a cri&s;is. The poor victim, as it appeared, had been knock|ed on the head a day or two before the ceremony was to take place; and the prie&s;ts had been pre|paring for the &s;olemnization, in which, however, there was nothing &s;o very horrid as might have been expected. The chief &s;acrifices were dogs and pigs, over the entrails of which the prie&s;ts made long prayers and incantations, holding at the &s;ame time tufts of red feathers in their hands, knotted in various forms. During the ceremony a <HI>mara,</HI> or royal girdle, was &s;pread out at full length; it was about five yards long and fifteen inches broad, ornamented with red and yellow feathers, the&s;e la&s;t taken from a dove found upon the i&s;land, and curiou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed, &s;o as to pro|duce a mo&s;t plea&s;ing effect; and be&s;ides this di&s;|play of royal magnificence, there was a kind of ark exhibited, the my&s;tical contents of which were kept &s;ecret, and were &s;uppo&s;ed to repre&s;ent the Eatooa to whom the &s;acrifice was offered up.
<PB N="137" REF="208">
The poor victim who had been killed had but a &s;mall &s;hare in the exhibition. After having been expo&s;ed a few hours in various attitudes, &s;ome|times ma&s;ked, and &s;ometimes covered with young plantain-trees, and prayers and petitions &s;eem|ingly addre&s;&s;ed to him, had been &s;aid or &s;ung in a plaintive tone, the body was buried in a grave about two feet deep, and then the prie&s;ts pro|ceeded with the u&s;ual offerings of dogs and pigs; the&s;e were dre&s;&s;ed in the nice&s;t manner; and their entrails, after being cautiou&s;ly and carefully exa|mined, were thrown into the fire and con&s;umed; from the&s;e, it &s;hould &s;eem, that their good and bad omens were progno&s;ticated. The &s;acrificed pig with his liver were now put upon a <HI>whatta</HI> or &s;caffold, and the carca&s;s of the dog was depo&s;ited by him on the &s;ame &s;helf, and then all the fea|thers, except an o&s;trich plume, were inclo&s;ed within the Eatooa in the ark, and the ceremony finally clo&s;ed.&mdash;Whoever is de&s;irous of reading the account at large, may &s;ee it very accurately &s;tated by Capt. Cook, who was an eye-witne&s;s to it, in the 2d volume of his voyages, pages 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, and 45. He remarks, that the victim is always of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, is generally &s;ome worthle&s;s wretch, who is &s;uddenly put to death without the lea&s;t notice, and who is &s;laughtered as oxen are with us by a &s;ingle blow.</P>
<P>The ordinary &s;orts of red feathers were collect|ed by officers and men all over the Friendly I&s;lands; but tho&s;e that were pre&s;ented to king Ottoo, and were now exhibited, were of the &s;uperior kind, and were in value much above the ordinary red feathers, as real pearls are with us in value above French pa&s;te. They were taken from the heads of the paroquets of Tongataboo and Ea-oo-whe,
<PB N="138" REF="209">
which are of &s;uperlative beauty, and precious in proportion to their &s;inene&s;s and the vivid glow of their dazzling colours.</P>
<P>Though all public trade was prohibited, as was u&s;ual, till the &s;hips &s;hould be furni&s;hed with fre&s;h provi&s;ions, it was not ea&s;y to re&s;train the men on &s;hore from trading with the women, who were for ever enticing them to de&s;ert. The ladies of plea|&s;ure in London, have not half the winning ways that are practi&s;ed by the Otaheitean mi&s;&s;es al|lure their gallants. With the &s;eeming innocence of doves, they mingle the wiline&s;s of &s;erpents. They have, however, one quality which is pecu|liar to them&s;elves, and that is con&s;tancy. When once they have made their choice, it mu&s;t be ow|ing to the &s;ailor him&s;elf if his mi&s;tre&s;s ever proves fal&s;e to him. No women upon earth are more faithful. They will endeavour to make them|&s;elves mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of all their lovers po&s;&s;e&s;s; but they will &s;uffer no one el&s;e to invade his pro|perty, nor will they embezzle any part of it them|&s;elves without having fir&s;t obtained his content; but that con&s;ent is not ea&s;ily withheld, for they are ince&s;&s;ant in their importunities, and will never cea&s;e a&s;king, while the &s;ailor has a rag or a nail to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Next day, Augu&s;t 26, a party of officers made a vi&s;it to Ottoo at Oparree, taking with them the poultry with which Capt. Cook was to &s;tock the i&s;land of Otaheite; the&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of a peacock and hen, a turkey-cock and hen, one gander and three gee&s;e, a drake and four ducks. They found at the palace there, a gander which had been given to Oberea, by Capt. Wallis, ten years be|fore; &s;everal goats, and a bull, which the Spani|ards had left when they la&s;t vi&s;ited the i&s;land about eight months ago: It was tied to a tree, alone,
<PB N="139" REF="210">
the cows having either died on their pa&s;&s;age, or were carried back to Spain. Capt. Cook &s;ent three cows he had on board, to this bull, for a finer was never &s;een, and his own bull he landed at Mattavai.</P>
<P>At Oparree, Capt. Cook planted melons, pota|toes, &s;haddocks, pine-apple plants, and &s;ome vines; he had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing &s;everal of them in great forwardne&s;s before he left the i&s;land.</P>
<P>During our four months &s;tay at this and the neighbouring i&s;lands, there was hardly a &s;ailor on board that had not made a very near connection with one or other of the women of this i&s;land; nor indeed, many officers that were proof again&s;t the allurements of the better &s;ort, who were no le&s;s amorous and artful, though more re&s;erved, than tho&s;e of the inferior order.</P>
<P>The temperature of the climate, the plenty of fre&s;h provi&s;ions, fi&s;h, fowl, pork, bread-fruit, yams, (a kind of &s;weet potatoes, which they have the art of &s;tewing with their pork in a very &s;a|voury manner) added to the mo&s;t delicious fruits of the i&s;land, contributed not a little to make our &s;tay here not only tolerable, but even de&s;irable; nor did idlene&s;s get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion even of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t indolently inclined. We had not a vacant hour between bu&s;ine&s;s and plea&s;ure, that was unemployed. We wanted no coffee-hou&s;es to kill time, nor Ranelaghs or Vauxhalls for our evening entertainments. Every nightly a&s;&s;embly in the plantations of this happy i&s;le, is furni&s;hed by beneficent nature with a more luxuriant fea&s;t than all the dainties of the mo&s;t &s;umptuous cham|petre, though lavi&s;hed with unlimited profu&s;ion, and emblazoned with the mo&s;t expen&s;ive decora|tions of art. Ten thou&s;and lamps, combined and ranged in the mo&s;t advantageous order by the
<PB N="140" REF="211">
hands of the be&s;t arti&s;ts, appear faint, when com|pared with the brilliant &s;tars of heaven, that unite their &s;plendor to illuminate the groves, the lawns, the &s;treams of Oparree. In the&s;e Ely&s;ian fields, immortality alone is wanting to the enjoyment of all tho&s;e plea&s;ures which the poet's fancy has con|ferred on the &s;hades of departed heroes, as the highe&s;t rewards of heroic virtue.</P>
<P>But amid&s;t &s;o many delights, it was not for human nature to &s;ub&s;i&s;t long without &s;atiety. Our &s;eamen began to be licentious, and our offi|cers to be punctilious. Several of the former were &s;everely puni&s;hed for indecency in &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the vice of the natives by their &s;hamele&s;s manner of indulging their &s;en&s;ual appetites; and two of the latter went a&s;hore to terminate an affair of ho|nour by the deci&s;ion of their pi&s;tols. It happened that neither of them were dextrous mark&s;men; they vented their rage by the fury with which they began the attack; and after di&s;charging three balls each, they returned on board, without any hurt, except &s;poiling a hat, a ball having pierced it, and grazed upon the head of him who wore it. It was, however, remarked, that the&s;e gentlemen were better friends than ever, during the remaining part of the voyage.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things went on by way of amu&s;e|ment to &s;ome, others were more u&s;efully employed in the repairs of the &s;hip. The ma&s;t that was &s;hattered in the head, and carried a&s;hore to be repaired, was in a &s;hort time rendered more firm than ever; the &s;ails that had been &s;plit, and were otherwi&s;e rendered unfit for further &s;ervice, were replaced: the cordage carefully examined, the ma&s;ts new rigged; and, in &s;hort, the whole re|pairs compleated with more celerity and &s;trength than could have been expected, in a place where

<PB N="141" REF="213">
many conveniencies were wanting to fit us out for that part of our voyage which &s;till remained to be performed.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, repairs were not more nece&s;&s;ary for our equipment than provi&s;ions. The purvey|ors, therefore, and butchers, were ince&s;&s;antly employed in purcha&s;ing and killing hogs for pre|&s;ent u&s;e, and the &s;alters in &s;alting the overplus for future &s;tores; while the Captains and &s;uperior of|ficers were devi&s;ing new amu&s;ements to keep the King and his Chiefs in good humour, in order to encourage their people to furni&s;h us with am|ple &s;upplies.</P>
<P>Not a day pa&s;&s;ed but &s;ome new exhibition was contrived for their entertainment. Omai, of whom little account was made, but for his riches, contributed his &s;hare to vary the &s;cenes of plea|&s;ure. He one day endeavoured to ride out on hor&s;eback, in his armour, brandi&s;hing his glitter|ing &s;word, to the terror and amazement of the gaping multitude, when, lo! he was brought to the ground by a &s;udden &s;tart of his &s;pirited hor&s;e. Another day he diverted them with playing off fire-works, under the direction of the chief engi|neer. He was now made a principal in all public &s;hews, and was pu&s;hed forward with King Ottoo him&s;elf. In a naval review, which was exhibited by Towha, the great Admiral, Omai had the command of one divi&s;ion of the fleet, while King Ottoo commanded another divi&s;ion, and Towha the centre. The greate&s;t dexterity appeared in their arrangements to land, where the military exerci&s;es were chiefly carried on; one party en|deavouring to &s;upplant the other, in order to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t advantageous ground. In the&s;e manoeuvres Omai acquitted him&s;elf with tolerable applau&s;e, being well &s;upported in all his
<PB N="142" REF="214">
exerci&s;es by Capt. Cook, who played him off as having been much improved in arts and military exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay, there was a rumour of actual war, and the forces of the i&s;land, both by &s;ea and land, were called forth in earne&s;t, to be in readi|ne&s;s to embark on the fir&s;t notice. This war, it &s;eems, had originated in 1774, when Capt. Cook was here before, and in part had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted ever &s;ince, neither &s;ide caring to come to action; but it now came to a cri&s;is, and news was brought that the Otaheitean party in Eimeo had been wor&s;ted, and had fled to the mountains; and that a reinforcement was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. All trade was therefore &s;topped; no cocoa-nuts to be had, the milk of which was the only liquor, ex|cept water, which the &s;hip's company were al|lowed to drink; and the weather being exce&s;&s;ive hot, there was great murmuring among the men both on board and on &s;hore. Capt. Cook was under the nece&s;&s;ity of interceding with King Ot|too to renew trade. Whether peace was made, or only a truce for a &s;hort time, is not certain, but in a few days the warriors di&s;per&s;ed, and every thing went on again after the u&s;ual manner.</P>
<P>On the above rumour, it was computed, that near 300 war canoes were mu&s;tered in Mattavai bay, with &s;tages on each, on which &s;at from three to fix Chiefs in their warlike dre&s;&s;es, which &s;eemed calculated more for &s;hew than u&s;e in battle. On their heads were large turbans wound round in many folds, and over that a mon&s;trous helmet; and on their bodies, in&s;tead of the light airy dre&s;s worn in common, they were incumbered by many garments of their own cloth, which added indeed to their &s;tature, but which mu&s;t di&s;qualify them from exerting their &s;trength in the day of battle.
<PB N="143" REF="215">
Men of fertile imaginations, fond of tracing the analogy of ancient cu&s;toms, among the different nations of the world, might po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover &s;ome &s;imilarity between the&s;e cumbrous dre&s;&s;es, and tho&s;e of the Knights of ancient chivalry, who fought in armour. It is certain, that the Ota|heitean, who fights on foot, mu&s;t feel the &s;ame encumbrance from his heavy war-dre&s;s, as the ancient Knight, who fought on hor&s;eback, mu&s;t have done from his unwieldy armour; and there is no doubt but the former will, one time or other, be laid a&s;ide in the tropical i&s;les, as much as the latter is now in every other part of the world.</P>
<P>Soon after the fir&s;t interview, Oedidee, of whom we have &s;poken, brought a wife on board the Re&s;olution, whom he had lately married; which di&s;credits the notion that was univer&s;ally believed by former Voyagers, that tho&s;e who be|longed to the &s;ociety of Arreoys were &s;worn to ce|libacy. Either this man was an impo&s;tor, or the fact ju&s;t mentioned cannot be true. He appeared in a rich Engli&s;h dre&s;s, which had been &s;ent him as a pre&s;ent from England, perhaps from the Ad|miralty. They were kindly received by Capt. Cook, and had much re&s;pect paid them. Soon after his arrival, fire-works of a new device were played off before many thou&s;ands of the natives; but it was ea&s;y to remark, that they were not all equally delighted with the exhibition.</P>
<P>The common people were thrown into the ut|most con&s;ternation by a &s;torm of thunder and lightning, which almo&s;t in&s;tantly &s;ucceeded. Nor were they ever perfectly reconciled to us after|wards. They thought it pre&s;umption in us to provoke the Eatooas, by imitating their powers and many of them retired to the woods, and never returned again to their hou&s;es during our stay.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="216">[Our] Journali&s;t &s;eems here to have been wanting in true intelligence. The rea&s;on of their flight was, a capital robbery that had been committed on the Surgeon's Mate of the Re&s;olution, who, having taken a tour into the country, had taken 4 hatchets with him, to purcha&s;e curio&s;ities, and was robbed of them all by the native whom he em|ployed to carry them. This alarmed the whole i&s;land. Even Ottoo him&s;elf had taken flight in dread of the con&s;equences; but was brought back by Capt. Cook, who followed him, and a&s;&s;ured him he would take no part in the affair, as the gentlemen them&s;elves might &s;eek their remedy, if they took the liberty of rambling abroad without leave.]</P>
<P>Whether they really wi&s;hed us to be gone, or dreaded our &s;tay, an alarm was &s;oon after &s;pread, that two Spani&s;h &s;hips were arrived at Oaite Peeha; that they had landed &s;ome men there, and were taking in &s;ome refre&s;hments to enable them to proceed. This report was every where circu|lated; and whether Capt. Cook believed it, or only made it a pretence to quicken our activity, he gave in&s;tant orders to clear the decks, mount the guns, which lay as it were buried in the hold, and to get every thing in readine&s;s for action. In the mean time, he &s;ent Mr. William&s;on, 3d Lieu|tenant, in the great cutter, manned and armed, to learn the truth of the report, by looking into the harbour of Oaite Peeha, to &s;ee if any foreign &s;hips were at anchor there, or whether the whole ru|mour was a fiction. That gentleman executed his commi&s;&s;ion with great celerity; having, in much le&s;s time than was expected, twice doubled Point Venus, &s;ailed round that promontory, made the harbour he was &s;ent to examine, and brought word that the only grounds for the report were,
<PB N="145" REF="217">
that four large trading canoes from an adjacent i&s;le, had been there a few days before his arrival, but that they &s;ailed again immediately, having been totally di&s;appointed of a market.</P>
<P>Though we were now relieved of the apprehen|&s;ions of an attack, we were not &s;uffered to relax in our preparations to depart. Wood and water had already been taken on board, and as much provi|&s;ions as could be procured; and little remained to be done, except to re-imbark our live &s;tock, to &s;trike the tents, and bring off the baggage of the officers and men who had been &s;tationed on &s;hore. Notice was therefore given to King Ottoo, of our intentions to &s;ail with the fir&s;t fair wind. He &s;eemed to expre&s;s great concern at our &s;udden re&s;olution, and came on board, attended with Towha, his great Admiral, and the principal of|ficers of his court, who all brought with them pre&s;ents of hogs and fruit, the only valuable pro|ductions of the i&s;land, except wood and water, to European Voyagers, and received in return, axes, hatchets, &s;pike-nails, and cutlery ware, &amp;c. which were re&s;erved to the la&s;t, in order to encourage the Chiefs to u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours with their people, to bring in their hogs, while it was yet in our power to receive them. No people on earth could expre&s;s their gratitude with more &s;eeming &s;incerity, than the King and his Chiefs, for the pre&s;ents they had received; nor were our Commanders and Officers wanting in &s;uitable returns.</P>
<P>On the 28th, having now been ju&s;t 40 days on the i&s;land, King Ottoo came on board, to invite our Commanders with their Officers to Oparree, as he under&s;tood it was to be the la&s;t time that he &s;hould have the opportunity of pay|ing us his acknowledgments on &s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="218">On the 29th, the pinnaces were ordered out, and we proceeded to Oparree, in the &s;ame &s;tate as on our fir&s;t vi&s;it. At the landing-place we were received with uncommon marks of friend|&s;hip. Every, Chief in that part of the i&s;land, of which Ottoo was the Earee-da-hai, or Lord paramount, to the number of 500 and more, attended, and conducted us to the King's hou&s;e or palace, where a &s;umptuous banquet was pro|vided, and after dinner a more numerous and brilliant company of performers a&s;&s;embled at the Theatre for our entertainment, than we had ever &s;een on any &s;tage in the tropical i&s;lands before.</P>
<P>There is a &s;amene&s;s in their drama, that admits of little or no variation, as perhaps to foreigners, who are unacquainted with the language and man|ners of a country, there may appear to be in every &s;tage-exhibition, wherever performed. Be that as it may, the dre&s;&s;es on this occa&s;ion were entirely new, and by far more &s;howy than formerly; the number of dancers were increa&s;ed; ten young Ladies compo&s;ed the fir&s;t group, with their heads mo&s;t magnificently ornamented with beads, red feathers, &s;hells of the mo&s;t beautiful colours, and wreathed with flowers in &s;o elegant a &s;tyle, as hardly to be excelled; had their mu&s;ic been equal to their performance, this part of the exhibition would have been compleat.</P>
<P>A party of warriors were next introduced, dre&s;&s;ed in their war-habits, con&s;i&s;ting, as has al|ready been ob&s;erved, of different coloured cloth, of their own manufacture, &s;o ingeniou&s;ly fa&s;hioned and blended together with &s;o much art, as, with the helmets that cover their heads, to fill the &s;tage with men, of who&s;e maje&s;tic figure it is not ea&s;y to convey an idea. The&s;e were armed with &s;pears, lances, and battle-axes, and exhibited all the

forms of attack and defence which are practi&s;ed in real action. The principal performers were the King's brother and a Chief of gigantic &s;tature, who di&s;played &s;uch wonderful grimaces and di&s;|tor&s;ions of face and countenance, by way of pro|vocation and challenge, as were not only laughable in &s;ome attitudes, but terrible in others. After the&s;e di&s;appeared, the players were brought for|ward, and performed a more &s;erious piece than we had yet &s;een, at which the natives &s;at graver and more compo&s;ed than u&s;ual. And the whole per|formance concluded with a dance of ten boys, dre&s;t in every re&s;pect like the girls in the fir&s;t &s;cene, with their hair flowing in ringlets down their &s;houlders, and their heads ornamented in a very theatrical &s;tyle.</P>
<P>When the play was over we returned to our boats, attended by the whole a&s;&s;embly, who ac|companied us to the water-&s;ide, where the King took a mo&s;t affectionate leave.</P>
<P>On the 29th Capt. Cook ordered all the women to be put on &s;hore, which was a ta&s;k not ea&s;ily ef|fected, most of them being very loth to depart; nor was it of much con&s;equence, as they found means afterwards to follow us to Hueheine, Ulitea, and the other Society I&s;les; nor did they leave us, till our final departure on our northern di&s;co|veries, never more to return.</P>
<P>Several of the &s;ailors being very de&s;irous to &s;tay at Otaheite, King Ottoo intere&s;ted him&s;elf in their behalf, and endeavoured to prevail on Capt. Cook to grant their reque&s;t; but he peremptorily rejected every application of that kind though often repeated; nor would he &s;uffer any of the natives to enter on board, though many would gladly have accompanied us wherever we intended to &s;ail; they had even been a&s;&s;ured that we never

intended to vi&s;it their country any more. Some of the women too would have followed their Ehoonoas, or Pretanne hu&s;bands, could they have been permitted; but Capt. Cook was equally aver&s;e to the taking any of the natives away, as to the leaving any of his own people behind. He was very &s;en&s;ible, that when once cloyed with enjoyment, they would reciprocally pine for home, to which it would not be in their power to return; and that for a little pre&s;ent gratification, they would ri&s;que the happine&s;s of the remaining part of their lives.</P>
<P>King Ottoo, when he found he could not ob|tain his wi&s;hes, in this re&s;pect, applied to Capt. Cook for another favour, which was, to allow his carpenters to make him a che&s;t, or pre&s;s, to &s;ecure the trea&s;ures he had accumulated in pre&s;ents, and by way of traffic, from the European Voyagers. He even begged that it might be made &s;o large, that two men might &s;leep upon it, as otherwi&s;e neither locks, nor bars, nor bolts would be &s;uffi|cient to &s;ecure his trea&s;ure when the &s;hips were gone. This Capt. Cook readily granted, and while the workmen were employed in this &s;ervice, they were plentifully &s;upplied with barbicued hogs, and &s;uch dainties as the country afforded; and were &s;o carefully attended and protected, that they did not lo&s;e &s;o much as a &s;ingle nail. It was &s;ome of the&s;e workmen that Ottoo was &s;o de&s;irous to retain; but the&s;e were of too much con&s;e|quence on board to be parted with, had there been no other motive for bringing them away; nor was Ottoo much concerned about the depar|ture of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>While the carpenters were bu&s;ied in making this uncommon piece of furniture, King Ottoo was con&s;tant in attending their operations, and Omai had frequent conferences with him on the
<PB N="149" REF="223">
&s;ubject of his travels. He a&s;toni&s;hed him more by the relation he gave of the magnificence of the Morais in <HI>Pretanne,</HI> than by all the wonders with which he had before &s;urprized him. When he told him that the King's morai was open to all comers, and that the per&s;ons of the decea&s;ed Kings were to be &s;een as perfect to appearance as when in the vigour of youth, he &s;eemed to la|ment that his date of exi&s;tence was to be limited with his life; and that his remains were to peri&s;h, while his Morai pre&s;erved no memory that he had ever had a being. Omai endeavoured to impre&s;s him with an idea of the magnificence of the tombs and memorials of the dead that were to be &s;een in the Morais of Pretanne; but having nothing to compare them to, he was unable to make him&s;elf &s;ufficiently under&s;tood; nor was he more &s;ucce&s;s|ful in de&s;cribing the &s;olemn grandeur of the places of wor&s;hip, where the people a&s;&s;embled every &s;e|venth day, and at other &s;tated times, to offer up their prayers to the good &s;pirit. Of the &s;plendour of the theatres he could &s;peak more intelligibly, as &s;ome faint idea of them might be gathered from what had been exhibited on board the &s;hips, and in the illuminations and fire-works played off on &s;hore. When Omai told him of the magnitude of the palaces and hou&s;es in Pretanne, of their de|corations and furniture; of the extent of their plantations, and the multitude of living animals with which they were &s;tored, he li&s;tened to him with particular attention, as not doubting the truth of his relation; but when he began to de|&s;cribe the roads, and the rapidity with which the people travelled in carriages drawn by four-footed animals, no child could ever expre&s;s greater &s;ur|prize at Gulliver's travelling to the world of the moon on ganzas, than Ottoo, when Omai a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="150" REF="224">
him, they could traver&s;e an extent of ground equal to the whole length of the i&s;land of Otaheite in a &s;ingle day.</P>
<P>The King, as appeared by his genero&s;ity to Omai, was highly entertained by the &s;tory of his travels; for when he went to take leave, his Ma|je&s;ty pre&s;ented him with a double canoe, properly equipped and manned, in the room of that which he purcha&s;ed at New Zealand; but that, it &s;hould &s;eem, was con&s;tructed as a pre&s;ent to the Great King of Pritanne, which Capt. Cook could not take on board on account of its &s;ize.</P>
<P>Every preparation for &s;ailing being already compleated, the live &s;tock all on board except three cows and a bull, two ewes and a ram, two &s;he-goats, and the poultry already mentioned, which were left as pre&s;ents to King Ottoo.</P>
<P>In the evening both &s;hips were under &s;ail, di|recting their cour&s;e to the we&s;tward to Eimeo, accompanied by Omai in his Otaheitean ve&s;&s;el, with his two New Zealand youths on board, who di&s;covered no unea&s;ine&s;s at their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, nor any de&s;ire to return home.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Otaheite has already been &s;o often and &s;o accurately de&s;cribed, and the man|ners, cu&s;toms, and ways of living of the inha|bitants, &s;o amply enlarged upon by former voy|agers, that little remains to be added. The writer was attentive only to two facts, one of which he found rea&s;on to believe had been mi&s;repre&s;ented, and the other very unfairly related; the fir&s;t re|&s;pects the Society of Arreoys, compo&s;ed, as it was &s;aid, of a certain number of men and women, a&s;&s;ociated in lewdne&s;s, and &s;o abandoned to all &s;en&s;e of humanity, as to de&s;troy the i&s;&s;ue of their libidinous intercour&s;e; than which nothing could be more injurious to the characters of any people
<PB N="151" REF="225">
than this diabolical practice a&s;cribed to this &s;ociety.</P>
<P>There are in this and the adjoining i&s;lands, per|&s;ons of a middle rank between the Manahounas or Yeomen and the Earees, who having no concern in the government, nor any di&s;tinct property in the i&s;lands, a&s;&s;ociate together for their own amu&s;e|ment, and the entertainment of the public. The&s;e travel from place to place, and from i&s;land to i&s;land in companies, not unlike tho&s;e of the &s;trolling players in England, only that they per|form without pay; but that they cohabit indi&s;|criminately one with another, &s;o many men with &s;o many women in common, is no otherwi&s;e true, than the &s;ame may be &s;u&s;pected among the &s;trolling companies ju&s;t mentioned; nor are they under any other re&s;traints from marrying, than that the &s;ociety admits of no marriages among them&s;elves, nor of any married people to be of their &s;ociety, it being a rule with them, never to be encumbered with children; if therefore it &s;hould happen, that i&s;&s;ue &s;hould prove the con&s;equence of a ca&s;ual amour, there is no alternative; the mother mu&s;t either quit the &s;ociety, or &s;omehow or other di&s;po&s;e of her child; which &s;ome of them do there, as many unfortunate girls do here, by &s;ecretly mak|ing away with them to avoid infamy; it being equally di&s;graceful there to be found with child, while members of the Society of Arreoys, as it is for women here to be &s;o found without hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>The other fact, which the writer took pains to determine, was, whether the bea&s;tly cu&s;tom im|puted to them, of gratifying their pa&s;&s;ions without regard to places or per&s;ons, was well founded? and he &s;olemnly declares, that the gro&s;&s;e&s;t inde|cencies he ever &s;aw practi&s;ed while on the i&s;land, were by the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of our own people, who,
<PB N="152" REF="226">
without regard to character, made no &s;cruple to attempt openly and by force what they were un|able to effect with the free voluntary con&s;ent of the objects of their de&s;ire; for which &s;everal of them were &s;everely puni&s;hed. To a&s;&s;ert, there|fore, that not the lea&s;t trace of &s;hame is to be found among the&s;e people in doing that openly which all other people are naturally induced to cover, is an injurious calumny, not warranted by cu&s;tom, nor &s;upported by the general practice even of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of individuals among them.</P>
<P>The&s;e people have one cu&s;tom in common with the Neapolitans and Malte&s;e, which ought not to be forgotten, and that is, their fi&s;hing in the night and repo&s;ing them&s;elves in the day; like them too, they burn lamps while they fi&s;h, with the oil drawn from the cocoa-nut, which they know well how to extract.</P>
<P>On the 30th we continued our cour&s;e the whole day, under double-reefed top-&s;ails; and in the evening came in &s;ight of Eimeo, where we an|chored next day in a &s;afe harbour, and were re|ceived by the people with every appearance of ho&s;pitality.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t our live-&s;tock was landed, and as our &s;upply of wood at Otaheite was little more than ju&s;t &s;erved for pre&s;ent u&s;e, our carpenters and wooders were here &s;ent out to cut wood, and our purveyors to collect hogs. Here we found Omai, who had out-&s;ailed us in his double-ma&s;ted canoe, and who, on his arrival, had been diverting the natives with his feats of arms; and had rai&s;ed their curio&s;ity to a very high degree, by acquaint|ing them with our intention of paying them a vi&s;it, as no European &s;hip had ever anchored at that i&s;land before. The Chiefs of the i&s;land came on board, with large hogs by way of pre&s;ents; and
<PB N="153" REF="227">
were pre&s;ented, in return, with axes, hatchets, looking-gla&s;&s;es, and red feathers: our purveyors were likewi&s;e much gratified, by the &s;ucce&s;s they met with in marketing, purcha&s;ing the large&s;t hogs for the meere&s;t trifles; as for in&s;tance, a hog of 100 weight for twelve red feathers, and &s;o in proportion for le&s;s or larger.</P>
<P>But this friendly intercour&s;e was &s;oon changed to a &s;cene of de&s;olation, that no injury we could re|ceive from the pilfering di&s;po&s;ition of the inha|bitants could ju&s;tify. The people had brought us every thing their i&s;land afforded, and had left it to the genero&s;ity of the purcha&s;ers to give, in return, whatever they plea&s;ed; but unfortunately</P>
<P>On the 2d of October, a goat was mi&s;&s;ing from the live-&s;tock. It had been &s;ecretly conveyed away in the night, from the pa&s;tures on which they were placed to feed, notwith&s;tanding the vi|gilance of the guard appointed to look after them. With the lo&s;s of this animal, which no doubt was looked upon as a prize of great value, the Earee of the i&s;land was made acquainted by Capt. Cook, and a peremptory requi&s;iton made to have it re&s;tored, on pain of having his country laid wa&s;te, his &s;hipping de&s;troyed, and him&s;elf per|&s;onally puni&s;hed for the crime of his &s;ubjects. The King promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and required time for enquiry, but as &s;oon as he was at liberty he ab&s;conded, and was no more &s;een; and the goat being &s;till mi&s;&s;ing, and no means u&s;ed for reco|vering and re&s;toring it, a party from both &s;hips, with the marines in a body, were ordered out to &s;earch for it and bring it back; or if it could not be found, to carry the threats of the Commander into execution. For three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively they con|tinued their &s;earch without effect; till tired with the trifling eva&s;ions of the Chief, they began, fir&s;t
<PB N="154" REF="228">
by burning the &s;u&s;pected hou&s;es, where they had rea&s;on to think the goat was concealed; and that not &s;ucceeding, the deva&s;tation became general, burning and de&s;troying indi&s;criminately &s;ome of the be&s;t hou&s;es, and as many of their large war canoes as fell in their way; at the &s;ame time cut|ting down their fruit-trees, and de&s;troying their plantations. The natives who lived at a di&s;tance, hearing of the havock that was made near the bay, filled their canoes with &s;tones and &s;unk them, in hopes of pre&s;erving them, but that availed them nothing. The Captain ordered boats to be manned and armed, the canoes that were &s;unk to be weighed up and de&s;troyed; and in &s;hort, a general deva&s;tation to be carried thro' the whole i&s;land, if the goat &s;hould be withheld. Add to this, that two young natives of quality, being found on board our &s;hip, were made pri&s;oners, and told they were to be put to death, if the goat &s;hould not be re|&s;tored within a certain time. The youths pro|te&s;ted their own innocence, and di&s;claimed all knowledge of the guilty per&s;ons; notwith&s;tanding which, every preparation was apparently made for putting them to death. Large ropes were carried upon the main deck, and made fa&s;t &s;ore and aft; axes, chains, and in&s;truments of torture were placed upon the quarter deck in the &s;ight of the young men; who&s;e terrors were increa&s;ed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the information of Omai, who gave them to under|&s;tand that, by all the&s;e &s;olemn preparations, their doom was finally determined. Under the&s;e appre|hen&s;ions, the poor youths remained till</P>
<P>The 9th, when about three in the afternoon a body of between 50 and 60 natives, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> from the &s;hip ha&s;tening to the harbour, who, when they came near, held up the goat in their arms
<PB N="155" REF="229">
in raptures that they had found it, and that it was &s;till alive.</P>
<P>The joy of the impri&s;oned youths is not to be expre&s;&s;ed; and when they were relea&s;ed, in&s;tead of &s;hewing any &s;igns of re&s;entment, they were ready to fall down and wor&s;hip their deliverers. It can &s;carce be credited, when the deva&s;tation, cea&s;ed, how &s;oon the injury they had &s;uffered was forgotten, and provi&s;ions again brought to market, as if no violences had ever been committed by us; only the Earee of the i&s;land never made his appearance. Though this account was generally di&s;credited on the fir&s;t publication of this journal, yet it now appears by the relation of Capt. Cook him&s;elf, that it was well founded. We have al|ready ob&s;erved, that a war had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween King Ottoo, and Mahaine, the Earee of Eimeo, and Capt. Cook had been &s;olicited to take part in it, which he had declined, and thereby had lo&s;t the friend&s;hip of Towha; but after having burnt the hou&s;es of many of the enemies of Ottoo, had broke up, burnt and de&s;troyed more than 20 canoes, mo&s;t of them war canoes, he regretted that he had been obliged to do them more mi&s;chief than they had &s;uffered from Towha in his late ex|pedition.</P>
<P>All this while multitudes of the inhabitants of Otaheite, who had &s;tolen off in the night in their canoes (mo&s;tly women) were witne&s;&s;es of the &s;e|verity with which this theft was puni&s;hed at Eimeo; but it &s;eemed to make no unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion upon them. They continued their good offices as long as we remained in the Society I&s;les.</P>
<P>Having procured a large quantity of wood; of which Otaheite furni&s;hed but a &s;canty &s;upply, and likewi&s;e a number of hogs for pre&s;ent u&s;e and fu|ture &s;tores.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="230">On the 12th in the morning we prepared to &s;ail, and before noon were out at &s;ea with a fine breeze, directing our cour&s;e to N. W. for Hue|heine, to which i&s;land Omai had previou&s;ly &s;et &s;ail before us.</P>
<P>In the night the weather being hazy, Omai lo&s;t &s;ight of the &s;hips, and fired his gun, which was an&s;wered by the Re&s;olution. During the after|noon the breeze left us, and a dead calm en&s;uing, made our Otaheitean pa&s;&s;engers immoderately &s;ick by the rolling of the &s;hip. They then began to repent their folly in following the fugitives whom they had no hopes of ever reclaiming, and to wi&s;h them&s;elves &s;afe home again on the &s;hores of Mattavai.</P>
<P>On the 13th in the morning we came in &s;ight of Hueheine, and about noon were clo&s;e in with the land, when the natives came in multitudes, with hogs and provi&s;ions of all kinds, as pre&s;ents to their friends. Omai, who had already reached the &s;hore, and hauled his ve&s;&s;el upon the beach, was encircled by the natives, who crowded about him, &s;ome to gratify their curio&s;ity, and others to expre&s;s their joy at his return. In le&s;s than half an hour King Oreo was &s;een to go aboard the Re&s;olution. He had with him two large hogs, as pre&s;ents to Capt. Cook, with &s;ome bread-fruit ready roa&s;ted, and a large quantity of bananoes, plantains, and other fruit. Capt. Cook received him with open arms, enquiring particularly after the good old venerable King Oree, for whom he entertained the mo&s;t perfect friend&s;hip; and being told he was dead, he could not help &s;hedding tears. We were &s;oon after favoured with a vi&s;it from Oreo, who made a like pre&s;ent to Capt. Clerke, and received in return a brea&s;t-plate of red fea|thers,
<PB N="157" REF="231">
with which he &s;eemed better plea&s;ed, than with any thing that had before been given him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he returned on &s;hore, he i&s;&s;ued out orders, requiring all his people to behave with the &s;tricte&s;t ju&s;tice to his good friends from Pretanne; and he appointed proper Officers to &s;ee his or|ders carried into execution, but without effect; for he had hardly reached his place of abode, be|fore one fellow was detected on board the Re&s;o|lution in &s;tealing iron from the armourer's forge, and had one &s;ide of his head and eye-brows clo&s;e &s;haved and both his ears cut clean from his tem|ples, by way of example to deter others.</P>
<P>On the 19th, peace being e&s;tabli&s;hed in the u&s;ual form, the live &s;tock were landed, among which were a hor&s;e and mare for Omai, two cows and a bull were intended for King Oree, if he had been alive, but being dead, were left with Oreo.</P>
<P>As this was one of the mo&s;t plentiful of all the Society I&s;les, it was propo&s;ed to make &s;ome &s;tay here, in order to careen the &s;hips, and to lay in provi&s;ions for future u&s;e. This was the more ne|ce&s;&s;ary, as we were about to &s;ail to countries wholly unknown, where it was uncertain what ac|commodations we might meet with, or to what &s;traits we might be reduced. The tents were therefore put a&s;hore, the beds and furniture of every kind unladen, and every crevice of the &s;hips examined, &s;craped, wa&s;hed with vinegar, and &s;moked; and while this la&s;t operation was perform|ing, the lower port-holes were left open, for the rats to make their e&s;cape; in &s;hort, a thorough revi&s;ion was directed to be made of every thing on board, as well to clean&s;e the furniture from the vermin, as to remove the danger of infection from putrid air, generated by a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of multitudes of both &s;exes, in clo&s;e re&s;ort between
<PB N="158" REF="232">
decks ever &s;ince our arrival at Otaheite. The &s;ick were at the &s;ame time landed for the benefit of the air, and every means u&s;ed to recover, and to pre|&s;erve them in health, when recovered.</P>
<P>Among the &s;ick was Capt. Cook him&s;elf, for who&s;e recovery the crews of both &s;hips were under much concern, as the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage was thought in a great mea&s;ure to depend upon his care and conduct. By the Doctor's advice, he was prevailed upon to &s;leep on &s;hore; where he was a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attended night and day by the Surgeons of both &s;hips, who alternately watched with him, till he was out of danger. As &s;oon as he was able, he rode out every day with Omai on hor&s;eback, followed by multitudes of the natives, who, attracted by the novelty of the &s;ight, flocked from the remote&s;t parts of the i&s;land to be &s;pec|tators. In the mean time, the &s;hips were crowded with hogs, poured in upon us fa&s;ter than the butchers and &s;alters could di&s;patch them; for &s;e|veral days after our arrival, &s;ome hundreds, great and &s;mall, were brought on board, and if any were refu&s;ed, they were thrown into the boats and left behind. Bread-fruit, bananoes, plantains, cocoa-nuts and yams were brought in the &s;ame plentiful proportions, and purcha&s;ed for trifles. Red fea|thers were here, as at Otaheite, a very marketable commodity, with which the &s;eamen made pur|cha&s;es of cloth, and other manufactures of the i&s;land; tho&s;e of them, who were followed by their mi&s;&s;es from Otaheite, kept &s;eparate tables for them, at a &s;mall expence; the mi&s;&s;es catered and cooked for their mates, who fea&s;ted every day on barbecued pigs, &s;tewed fowls, roa&s;ted bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and a variety of other delicacies, which were purcha&s;ed for them for the mere&s;t trifles. Among the common men, there were
<PB N="159" REF="233">
many who laid in &s;tore of the&s;e good things for their future &s;upport in ca&s;e of being reduced to &s;hort allowance, and they had rea&s;on afterwards to con&s;ole them&s;elves on their provident care.</P>
<P>The example made of the fir&s;t Indian thief, by expo&s;ing him to the ridicule of his countrymen, had a better effect than a thou&s;and la&s;hings, which were forgotten almo&s;t as &s;oon as inflicted; whereas the laughable figure the fellow made with his ears off, and the hair of his head &s;haved, was a perpetual puni&s;hment, which it was not in his power to conceal. By this &s;ea&s;onable &s;everity, and the vigilance of the Officers, whom the King had appointed to &s;uperintend the police, we con|tinued unmole&s;ted for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>On our fir&s;t approaching the i&s;land we ca&s;t an|chor, till the ground for mooring &s;hould be exa|mined, and in weighing, to change our &s;tation, our cable parted, and we were obliged to leave the anchor behind, till we had more lei&s;ure to &s;way it up. This proved a trouble&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, in which we were at length a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the activity of the natives, who at &s;ervices of this kind are very alert. By diving, and properly fixing ropes, they helped us to recover our anchor in a few hours, which we had laboured at, in vain, for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>The carpenters and caulkers had no &s;ooner compleated their bu&s;ine&s;s on board, than they were ordered on &s;hore to erect a hou&s;e for Omai, who had been enabled, by the genero&s;ity of Capt. Cook, and his other friends, to purcha&s;e a &s;mall e&s;tate for a plantation, in the cultivation of which he was to proceed after the Engli&s;h manner, and to employ his two New Zealanders as labourers in digging, and preparing the ground.</P>
<P>The erection of a hou&s;e of pretty large dimen|&s;ions, with &s;table and out-offices (appendages new,
<PB N="160" REF="234">
and hitherto unnece&s;&s;ary in this country) was a work of no &s;mall labour, and could not be ac|compli&s;hed in any rea&s;onable time, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of many hands; the carpenters, and a number of labourers from both &s;hips were therefore &s;et to work, and though a watch was placed to look after their working-tools, the vi|gilance of Argos, could not have &s;ecured the more than golden prize to them, from &s;o many crafty Ja&s;ons. It happened, however, that a few chi&s;&s;els, gimblets, and other trifles were all that were mi&s;&s;ing; for as no nails or iron were to be u&s;ed in the con&s;truction of the buildings, the &s;aws, axes, adzes, and larger tools were not &s;o ea&s;y for them to carry off and conceal; while therefore the chief attention of the &s;entinels were fixed upon the&s;e, an Indian found means to carry off a quadrant from the a&s;tronomer's ob&s;ervatory; and though it was almo&s;t in&s;tantly mi&s;&s;ed, and the thief di&s;covered, and fired at while he was yet in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, he found means to e&s;cape to the woods, where he concealed his booty, notwith&s;tanding the mo&s;t vigilant &s;earch. At the firing of the gun, and the bu&s;tle that &s;ucceeded among the Indians, who were in crowds about the tents, the marines on board took the alarm, and putting them&s;elves in arms ha&s;tened on &s;hore, where they found all quiet, the thief having been found and brought in, by &s;ome of his companions, who were well rewarded for their fidelity. The fel|low was in&s;tantly taken on board and put in irons, where he remained all night. In the morning it appeared he was of &s;ome note, as a number of hogs, and great quantities of fruit and cloth were brought on board, to purcha&s;e his relea&s;e; but without effect. About noon he was brought to trial, and &s;entenced to &s;uffer the lo&s;s of both
<PB N="161" REF="235">
his ears, be&s;ides having his head &s;haved, and his eye-brows fleed, than which, no puni&s;hment could have &s;ubjected him to greater di&s;grace. In this bleeding condition he was &s;ent on &s;hore, and ex|po&s;ed, as a &s;pectacle, to intimidate the people from meddling for the future with what was not their own; at the &s;ame time they were given to under&s;tand that theft, among us, was con&s;idered as a capital crime. The Indians looked with hor|ror upon the man, and it was ea&s;y to perceive, that this act gave them general di&s;gu&s;t; even Omai was affected, though he endeavoured to ju&s;tify it to his Indian friends, by telling them, that if &s;uch a crime had been committed in the country where he had been, the thief would have been condemned to lo&s;e his life. How well &s;o|ever he might carry the matter off, he dreaded the con&s;equences to him&s;elf, which, in part, ap|peared before we left the i&s;land, and were pro|bably more &s;everely felt by him, &s;oon after we were gone. However, king Oreo and the chiefs about him &s;till continued to keep up appearances; they paid and received vi&s;its as u&s;ual, made pre|&s;ents, and accepted returns, and &s;uffered trade to go on between the inhabitants of the i&s;land and the &s;hips companies, as if no offence had been given. At all their fea&s;ts and entertainments the Captains and Omai were invited to be gue&s;ts, and plays and fire-works &s;ucceeded each other by way of political fine&s;&s;e, to promote harmony. In the mean time, another theft was committed at the &s;ame place. Mr. King, the a&s;tronomer, was robbed of his brandy-ca&s;e, &s;ome plates, and &s;ome knives and forks, which he never recovered; but his quadrant was brought back in a few days after it was &s;tolen, not at all damaged.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="236">On this occa&s;ion, trade was again interrupted, the Indians dreading to come to market when any of their people had been guilty of any fraud.</P>
<P>Capt. Cook, though he rode out every day, atttended by Omai, &s;till continued in a very weak condition; but was vi&s;ited, and had great atten|tion paid him by the chiefs; he rea&s;oned with Oreo on the ab&s;urd cu&s;tom of &s;u&s;pending trade, whenever any of his people had done us an in|jury; repre&s;ented the practice as equally hurtful to them as to us, and that, though the delinquent was liable to puni&s;hment, no other per&s;on would ever be mole&s;ted, unle&s;s the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice was interrupted, bv refu&s;ing to deliver up the crimi|nal when detected. This rea&s;oning had its weight with Oreo and his chiefs, who ordered the trade to be renewed as before. We had now been in harbour, in O-wharre road in Hueheine, more than thirty days, during which time Omai's build|ings were quite compleated, and he had got all his effects and furniture on &s;hore; the European &s;eeds, with which Capt. Cook had furni&s;hed him, &s;own, and part of his grounds planted with the fruit and other trees of the country, in all which he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted with every &s;pare hand from both &s;hips.</P>
<P>One would have imagined that, &s;eeing him|&s;elf apparently the riche&s;t man in the i&s;land, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much the fine&s;t hou&s;e, he would have been elated with his &s;ituation, and over|joyed at being &s;o happily placed; but quite the rever&s;e: he wanted rank, which was not in the power of fortune to confer, and nothing but power could give con&s;equence in a country where rank was not to be purcha&s;ed; the nearer therefore the time approached of our departure, the more de|jected he grew; and when he had made an en|tertainment at taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new &s;ettle|ment
<PB N="163" REF="237">
at which he was honoured with the com|pany of the commanders and officers from both &s;hips, and with the king and chiefs of the i&s;land, he could &s;carce conceal his trouble, being appre|hen&s;ive, as he told Capt. Clerke &s;ecretly, that as &s;oon as we were &s;ailed, they would level his build|ing with the ground, and make prize of all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Upon this occa&s;ion, however, Capt. Cook, who had all along treated him more like a &s;on than a pa&s;&s;enger, and who was now pretty well recovered, being acquained with the cau&s;e of his melancholy, embraced this opportunity of re|commending him to the protection of the king and the chiefs pre&s;ent, intimating to them, at the &s;ame time, that if any violence &s;hould be offered to Omai, or that he &s;hould be mole&s;ted in the free enjoyment of his property, he would, upon the return of the &s;hips, (for they entertained a notion that the return of the &s;hips would be pe|riodical) lay wa&s;te the i&s;land, and de&s;troy every human being that had, in any manner, been in|&s;trumental in doing him an injury. This threat made the deeper impre&s;&s;ion upon the chie&s;s, by what had lately happened at Eimco; for notwith|&s;tanding all their profe&s;&s;ions, it was very evident they were more influenced by fear than affection. Nothing, however, was wanting, to impre&s;s the chiefs with an opinion of Omai's con&s;equence. The drums, trumpets, bagpipes, hautboys, flutes, violins, and, in &s;hort, the whole band of mu&s;ic attended, and took it by turns to play while din|ner was getting ready; and when the company were &s;eated, the whole band joined in full con|cert, to the admiration of crowds of the inhabi|tants, who were a&s;&s;embled round the hou&s;e on this occa&s;ion. The dinner con&s;i&s;ted, as u&s;ual of barbecued hogs, fowls variou&s;ly dre&s;&s;ed, &s;ome af|ter
<PB N="164" REF="238">
the manner of the country, and others after the Engli&s;h manner, with plenty of other provi&s;ions, and wine and other liquors, with which king Oreo made very free. Dinner over, heivas and fire-works &s;ucceeded; and when night approached, the multitudes that attended as &s;pectators, di&s;|per&s;ed without the lea&s;t di&s;order.</P>
<P>We now received orders to prepare for our de|parture. We had, in this i&s;land, procured more than 400 hogs, many of them large.</P>
<P>Though it had been found in former voyages, that mo&s;t of tho&s;e that were carried to &s;ea alive refu&s;ed to eat, and con&s;equently were &s;oon killed, yet we re&s;olved to make one experiment more, and by procuring large quantities of yams, and other roots, on which they were accu&s;tomed to feed on &s;hore, we ventured to take a few alive in each &s;hip. For this purpo&s;e our carpenters pre|pared &s;tyes for their reception in tho&s;e parts where they might remain the coole&s;t: and while they were employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s, the live &s;tock that were &s;till on &s;hore were taken on board, as were likewi&s;e every other article that remained.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened till the 25th, when, early in the morning, we were &s;urprized with an account, that Omai's plantation was root|ed up and de&s;troyed, his fences broken down, and his hor&s;es and cattle &s;et at large, without be|ing able to di&s;cover who were concerned in this malicious and deliberate act of premeditated mi&s;|chief. Capt. Cook, highly incen&s;ed, offered con|&s;iderable rewards for di&s;covering and apprehend|ing the offenders; when it was found, that the fel|low who had had his head &s;haved, and his ears cut off, [who had threatened to kill Omai] was the principal, and, being a native of Ulietea, an adjacent i&s;land, had fled there for refuge; but
<PB N="165" REF="239">
Capt. Cook offering &s;ix large axes, for bringing him to ju&s;tice, and promi&s;ing to &s;tay &s;even days longer, to give time to apprehend him, &s;ome de&s;|peradoes undertook the ta&s;k, and on the fourth day brought him on board. He was charged as the &s;ole perpetrator; but it was thought he mu&s;t have had accomplices, as he could not by him|&s;elf, in one night, have plucked up &s;o many trees, de&s;troyed &s;o many plants, and dug and defaced the ground in &s;o many places, where the Euro|pean &s;eeds had been &s;own. However, he refu&s;ed to make any confe&s;&s;ion, and, when put in irons, remained &s;ullen.</P>
<P>The preparations for our departure, which this event had &s;u&s;pended, recommenced; and in the mean time, to &s;hew every attention po&s;&s;ible to Omai, the &s;pare hands from both &s;hips were &s;ent a&s;hore, in order to re&s;tore his plantation to its for|mer condition, and to rein&s;tate him in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it before the &s;hips &s;hould &s;ail. At the &s;ame time Capt. Cook ordered the following in&s;cription to be cut upon the out&s;ide of his hou&s;e:

And to recommend him the better to the chiefs, he was accompanied every day by Capt. Cook and &s;ome of his officers, who dined with him, and invited king Oreo, and the principal people of the i&s;land by turns, to be of the party. He al&s;o made entertainments for the young prince&s;&s;es and their brothers, with mu&s;ic and dancing accord|ing to the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion; and to plea&s;e the public in general, Capt. Cook cau&s;ed fire-works to be played off almo&s;t every other night, for their diver&s;ion. But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e
<PB N="166" REF="240">
endeavours to reconcile Omai to his country|men, he could not help thinking him&s;elf the object of their envy, rather than of their admi|ration. They beheld him in the &s;ame light as the gentlemen in every country &s;ee low-born ci|tizens &s;uddenly ri&s;ing from indigence to wealth giving them&s;elves airs, and affecting &s;tate. At the &s;ame time that they laugh at their folly, they en|courage their profu&s;ion; and while they partake of their entertainments, they take plea&s;ure in mortifying their pride. Such was the real ca&s;e with Omai. While he was fea&s;ting the chiefs, and had nails to give to one, red feathers to another, gla&s;s and china-ware to a third, and white &s;hirts to the ladies; Who but Omai? but when they found he had expended mo&s;t of what he had brought from abroad, and had but ju&s;t enough left by the bounty of his friends to buy him a plantation and to &s;tock it, the chiefs, while they partook of his entertainments, paid him little or no re&s;pect; and, had it not been for their deference to Capt. Cook, would probably have treated him, amid&s;t the &s;plendor of his banquets, with the utmo&s;t con|tempt.&mdash;Such is the di&s;po&s;ition of mankind through|out the world. Men, &s;prung from the dregs of the people, mu&s;t have &s;omething more than acci|dental riches to recommend them to the favour of their fellow-citizens; they mu&s;t have &s;uperior &s;en&s;e to direct their conduct, and &s;uperior ac|quirements to render the virtues they po&s;&s;e&s;s con|&s;picuous. That this was not the ca&s;e with Omai, every day's experience furni&s;hed &s;ufficient proofs, Not many nights had pa&s;&s;ed after the wa&s;te made on his plantation, before lights were &s;een about his hou&s;e, which, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, were intended to &s;et it on fire, had not the precipitancy of the centinel, by firing his piece too &s;uddenly, given
<PB N="167" REF="241">
the alarm, and furni&s;hed the incendiaries with notice to make their e&s;cape. The man, too, who had laid wa&s;te his plantation, and who was in irons on board the Re&s;olution, the night before we in|tended to &s;ail, found means either to jump over-board, or by &s;ome invi&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance to unloo&s;e his chains and &s;lip out of the &s;hip. He was to have been puni&s;hed, not by death, but by a ba|ni&s;hment wor&s;e than death. He was to have been put on &s;hore on &s;ome di&s;tant i&s;land, from whence it would have been next to impo&s;&s;ible he could ever have made his e&s;cape to mole&s;t Omai. How he came to get from his confinement is not cer|tainly known; but the &s;entinel who was &s;et to guard him, was &s;entenced to be publicly whipped, and to receive 24 la&s;hes every morning, for fix mornings &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and a mid&s;hipman and mate, who commanded the watch, were &s;entenced, the former to be expelled the &s;hip, to which he never more returned during the voyage; the other, to be turned before the ma&s;t; but on &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion was forgiven, as was likewi&s;e the &s;entinel, after &s;uffering the fir&s;t day's puni&s;hment. As &s;oon as the mid&s;hipman from the Re&s;olution came on board the Di&s;covery, the third Lieutenant of the Di&s;covery was ordered on board the Re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>On the 2d of November, being in readine&s;s to &s;ail, Capt. Cook took Omai a&s;ide, and gave him le&s;&s;ons of in&s;truction how to act. At the &s;ame time, directing him to &s;end his boat over to Uli|tea, his native i&s;land, to let him know how the Chiefs behaved to him in the ab&s;ence of the &s;hips. If well, he was to &s;end by the me&s;&s;enger three white beads; if they &s;eized upon his &s;tock, or broke in upon his plantation, three red beads; or
<PB N="168" REF="242">
if things remained ju&s;t as we left them, he was to &s;end three &s;potted beads.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 3d, we unmoored; and the wind being fair, we made &s;ail out of Hueheine road, and when we were under way, Omai came on board, either to prevail on Capt. Cook to let him return to England, or to take his final leave never to &s;ee him more. His parting was very af|fecting; if tears could have prevailed on Capt. Cook to let him return, Omai's eyes were never dry; and if the tendere&s;t &s;upplications of a du|tiful &s;on to an obdurate father, could have made any impre&s;&s;ion, Omai hung round his neck in all the &s;eeming agony of a child trying to melt the heart of a reluctant parent. He twined his arms round him with all the ardour of inviolable friend|&s;hip, till Capt. Cook, unable any longer to con|tain him&s;elf, broke from him, and retired to his cabin, to indulge that natural &s;ympathy which he could not re&s;i&s;t, leaving Omai to dry up his tears, and compo&s;e him&s;elf on the quarter-deck.</P>
<P>When he had vented his grief, he returned and rea&s;oned with Omai on the impropriety of his reque&s;t, reminded him of his anxieties while in England, le&s;t he &s;hould never more have been permitted to return home; and now that he had been re&s;tored to his country and friends at an im|men&s;e expence to his Royal Ma&s;ter, it was childi&s;h to entertain a notion of being carried back. Omai &s;till renewed his tears; he had wi&s;hed, he &s;aid, to &s;ee his country and friends; but, having &s;een them, he was contented, and would never long for home again. Capt. Cook a&s;&s;ured him of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> be&s;t wi&s;hes; but his in&s;tructions mu&s;t be obeyed, which were to leave him with his friends. At parting, he added &s;ix large axes to the pre&s;ents he had before made him, and &s;ome chi&s;els and <PB N="169" REF="243">
Sheffield ware, which he knew would be u&s;eful to him.</P>
<P>Such was the parting of Omai from his beloved patron, who had contracted a real friend&s;hip for him. He &s;aid, he &s;hould be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all human beings when his protector was gone, for that the inhabitants would be plotting his de|&s;truction, and he &s;hould not have a happy moment while he had any thing left to live upon. His two New Zealand boys were under little le&s;s con|cern to part from the &s;hips than Omai him&s;elf. They had already learned to &s;peak Engli&s;h, &s;o as to be able to expre&s;s their hopes and their fears. They hoped to have gone along with the &s;hips, and they cried bitterly when they under&s;tood that they were to be left behind. Thence aro&s;e a new &s;eene between Omai and his boys, that had not the officers on the quarter-deck interpo&s;ed, might have ended unfortunately for Omai. They re|fu&s;ed to quit the &s;hip, till they were compelled to it by force, which was no ea&s;y matter; the elde&s;t now near &s;ixteen, being of an athletic make, and of prodigious &s;trength, and the younge&s;t about eleven, being likewi&s;e a giant for his age, were not ea&s;ily managed. They were both very tracta|ble and obliging, till they found they were to be left at Hueheine, but then they grew de&s;perate, e&s;pecially the younge&s;t, who was not ea&s;ily &s;ub|dued. They di&s;covered di&s;po&s;itions the very re|ver&s;e of the i&s;landers among whom they were de&s;|tined to re&s;ide, during the remainder of their lives; and, in&s;tead of a mean, timid &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, they &s;hewed a manly, determined re&s;olution not to be &s;ubdued, though overcome; and ready, if there had been a po&s;&s;bility to &s;ucceed, to have made a &s;econd, or even a third attempt, to have regained their liberty. We could never learn Capt. Cook's
<PB N="170" REF="244">
real rea&s;on, for refu&s;ing to take on board &s;ome of tho&s;e gallant youths from New Zealand, who, no doubt, would have made u&s;eful hands in the high latitudes they were about to explore; and would be&s;ides have exhibited living pictures of a people who&s;e portraits have been imperfectly de|picted, even by our be&s;t draught&s;men. There is a dauntle&s;s fiercene&s;s in the eyes and countenance of a New Zealand warrior, that lo&s;es all its force under the feeble pencil of a fribbling arti&s;t. It is now, indeed, too late to lament the non-im|portation of a native from every climate, where Nature had marked a vi&s;ible di&s;tinction in the characters of per&s;on and mind. As one in each climate might have been procured without force; and when a&s;&s;embled together, would have formed an academy for the &s;tudy of the human frame, that would have attracted the notice of arti&s;ts from every country, more than the celebrated &s;tatues of Greece and Rome.</P>
<P>[Omai's European weapons con&s;i&s;ted of a mu&s;|ket, bayonet, and cartouch-box; a fowling-piece, two pair of pi&s;tols, and two or three &s;words or cut-la&s;&s;es. With the&s;e, and with his coat of mail, he thought him&s;self invincible; and it &s;eemed that he had a project in his head to make war upon Bola-bola, in revenge for the injuries his father had re|ceived from the men of that country, when they conquered Ulietea.] <HI>Capt. Cock's Remark.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hall now take our leave of Omai, with ju&s;t ob&s;erving, that Capt. Cook having furni&s;hed him with the means of enriching his country and the adjacent i&s;les with &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful ge|nerae of four-footed animals, (hor&s;es, cows, &s;heep and goats) be&s;ides a breed of gee&s;e, turkies, and other dome&s;tic appendages, that were &s;trangers to the tropical i&s;lands, he might, with proper management, ri&s;e &s;uperior to all the Earees in the
<PB N="171" REF="245">
kingdoms round him, had Nature given him ta|lents to improve tho&s;e advantages which chance had thrown in his way; but even his patron was doubtful of his conduct, and was anxious to the la&s;t to warn him how he proceeded.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 3d of November, the day we &s;et out from Hueheine, we arrived at Ulietea, and were &s;uddenly &s;urrounded with boats laden with provi&s;ions. Here, as u&s;ual, we landed our live-&s;tock, carried the tents a&s;hore, and erected the a&s;tronomer's ob&s;ervatory. One of our fir&s;t exploits in this i&s;land, was the act of a &s;entinel, who was &s;et to watch the &s;heep and the goats, and who, being in&s;ulted by &s;ome of the natives, ran one of them through the body. The decea&s;ed was in&s;tantly carried off by his companions, and for a few nails was properly di&s;po&s;ed of, &s;o that we never heard any thing more of his murder. This happened</P>
<P>On the 6th, when the grind-&s;stone was &s;tolen from the Di&s;covery; but the thief being detected and apprehended, it was brought back the &s;ame day, together with a large hog, by way of ran&s;om for the pilferer.</P>
<P>On the 16th, about two in the morning, the &s;entinel at the ob&s;ervatory fell a&s;leep, and &s;uffered his mu&s;ket to be carried away. He then took it into his head to leave his po&s;t and follow after it, with a de&s;ign, however, never more to return to the &s;hips. When this was known on board, or|ders were immediately i&s;&s;ued for &s;ecuring the King and Royal family, till the man &s;hould be taken and re&s;tored; threatening at the &s;ame time to lay wa&s;te the country, if he was &s;uffered to e&s;cape. It was &s;ome days before he was di&s;co|vered, and at length he was found at the di&s;tance of about ten miles, &s;itting in a lone hou&s;e, &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="172" REF="246">
by Indians, chiefly girls, who had &s;tri|ped him of his clothes, and di&s;gui&s;ed him in an Indian dre&s;s, with his head curiou&s;ly ornamental with feathers, and his mu&s;ket lying leaded by him. He made no re&s;i&s;tance, Capt. Cook him&s;elf having conde&s;cended to be his pur&s;uer. He was put in irons, tried, and &s;entenced to have 24 la&s;hes every|day for a week; but, being a brave &s;oldier, on &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, was forgiven.</P>
<P>On the 22d, Mr. M&mdash;, Mid&s;hipman, and the Gunner's Mate, made their e&s;cape in a canoe, with two of their Otaheitean mi&s;&s;es, and landed on an adjoining i&s;land, with a view to continue their cour&s;e to Otaheite, as &s;oon as they had fur|ni&s;hed them&s;elves with provi&s;ions for the voyage. They were no &s;ooner mi&s;&s;ed, and report made to Capt. Cook, than he ordered all the boats to be manned, and a pur&s;uit to commence with all po&s;|&s;ible expedition; at the &s;ame time putting the King, his two &s;ons, and his daughter <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">,</HI> under confinement, till the fugitives &s;hould be taken and re&s;tored. This he did, no doubt, to intere&s;t the people of the i&s;land in the pur&s;uit, and to prevent their a&s;&s;i&s;ting the de&s;erters in making their e&s;cape. He al&s;o promi&s;ed a reward of large axes, looking-gla&s;&s;es, and other articles of con&s;i|derable value, to any of the natives who &s;hould be in&s;trumental in apprehending and bringing them back. To enforce his orders, he cau&s;ed all the canoes to be &s;eized, and he threatened de&s;truction to the country if his men &s;hould be withheld. He &s;et the King at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the pur&s;uit of the fugitives; but threatened the young princes with &s;lavery, if they were not brought back within a certain time. This might &s;eem hard u&s;age, yet it had its effect; and without this &s;teady re&s;olute proceeding, the de&s;erters would never have been
<PB N="173" REF="247">
recovered. Our own boats went, day after day, to all the adjoining i&s;lands, without being able to learn the lea&s;t trace of them; and this they con|tinued, till having &s;earched every i&s;land within the di&s;tance of two day's &s;ail, they were at length obliged to give over any farther &s;earch as fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>On the 29th, after &s;even days ab&s;ence, &s;ome Indians came on board, and acquainted Capt. Cook that the fugitives were found, and that in a few days they would be brought back. This was a well-concerted tale to put us off our guard, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> they had carried a deep-laid plot into exe|cuti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">, to &s;eize Capt. Clerke and Lieut. Gore, and to carry them off, and confine them till the pri&s;oners on board were relea&s;ed. This was near being effected, when it was di&s;covered by a girl, that one of the officers had been brought from <HI>Hueheine.</HI> She, hearing &s;ome of the Uliteans &s;ay, that they would &s;eize Capt. Clerke and Mr. Gore, ran to acquaint the fir&s;t of our people &s;he met, with what they intended; for which &s;he was threatened with death by the Uliteans for making the di&s;covery. It was therefore found nece&s;&s;ary to conceal her, till an opportunity offered to convey her to her friends. Upon this information, Capt. Cook re|newed his threatenings, which he &s;aid he would in&s;tantly order to be carried into execution, if the men were not delivered up.</P>
<P>Next day, (the 30th) about five in the evening, a number of canoes were &s;een at a di&s;tance, making towards the &s;hips; and as they approached nearer, they were heard to &s;ing and to rejoice, as if they had &s;ucceeded in finding what they went in &s;earch of. About &s;ix they came &s;o high, that we could di&s;cern with our gla&s;&s;es the de&s;erters fa&s;tened toge|ther, but without their mi&s;&s;es. They were no &s;ooner brought on board, than the royal pri&s;oners
<PB N="174" REF="248">
were relea&s;ed, to the un&s;peakable joy of all but the two fugitives, who were under great appre|hen&s;ions for their lives. Their puni&s;hment, how|ever, was not &s;o &s;evere as might have been ex|pected. S&mdash; was &s;entenced to receive 24 la&s;hes, and M&mdash; turned before the ma&s;t, where he continued to do duty while there was little or no|thing to do; but on a&s;king forgivene&s;s, was re|&s;tored to his former &s;tation on the quarter-deck.</P>
<P>It appeared that the Indians had traced them from i&s;land to i&s;land, from Ulietea to Otaha, from Otaha to Bolabola, from Bolabola to the little i&s;land Taboo, where they were found; but where they never would have been looked for by us, had not the Indians traced them out.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of December the tents were &s;truck, the live &s;tock taken on board, and we prepared to &s;ail.&mdash;An account of our intercour&s;e with the Earees and Chiefs of the i&s;land, would only be a tedious repetition of what had pa&s;&s;ed before in the other i&s;lands; but one thing &s;till remains to be told. Among&s;t the vi&s;itors, who occa&s;ionally came on board the Re&s;olution, was Ooroo, the dethron|ed Monarch of Ulietea, who re&s;ides at Hueheine, a royal wanderer, furni&s;hing in his per&s;on an in|&s;tance of the in&s;tability of power; but what is more remarkable, of the re&s;pect paid by the&s;e peo|ple to particular families, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e who have once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the rights of &s;overeignty; for they &s;uffer Ooroo to pre&s;erve all the en&s;igns of royalty, though he has lo&s;t his dominions. Ano|ther in&s;tance of the like kind, was Oree, with whom Capt. Cook was well acquainted, when in 1769, he commanded the Endeavour. Oree was the Chief of Hueheine, but he now re&s;ides in Ulietea in a private &s;tation, but &s;till pre&s;erves his con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="249">On the 2d, notice was given to the Otaheitean mi&s;&s;es that they mu&s;t all prepare to depart; that the &s;hips were in readine&s;s to leave the country, never to return to the Society I&s;lands any more. This news cau&s;ed great lamentation, and much bu&s;tle and confu&s;ion. They were now at a great di&s;tance from home, and every one was eager to get what &s;he could for her&s;elf before &s;he could part from her beloved. Mo&s;t of them had already &s;tript their mates of almo&s;t every thing they po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, and tho&s;e who had &s;till &s;omething in re|&s;erve, led a &s;ad life till they &s;hared it with them. But what is mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing, notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid of the con&s;tancy of the&s;e mi&s;&s;es, there were &s;carce a man who had to do with them without being injured by them. When we took our departure from Ulietea, we had &s;carce hands enough able to do duty on board, there being more than 30 under the Surgeon's hands. In this &s;ituation, tho&s;e who were well were obliged to do duty for tho&s;e who were hurt; which, to do them ju&s;tice, they very willingly performed.</P>
<P>It was not, however, till the 7th, that we could get the &s;hips clear of the&s;e trouble&s;ome gentry. In the mean time a me&s;&s;enger had arrived from Omai to Capt. Cook, according to his de&s;ire, with a very &s;atisfactory account that every thing went well with him, except that his goat had died in kidding, and reque&s;ting two more axes, and another goat, which were readily &s;ent him.</P>
<P>On the 8th we &s;et &s;ail with a bri&s;k wind to the we&s;tward, and Capt. Cook having received advice that the King of Bolabola had part of a large an|chor to di&s;po&s;e of, we directed our cour&s;e to that i&s;land, where we arrived on the 8th. Here both Captains landed, and were introduced to the old King. He received them according to the tro|pical
<PB N="176" REF="250">
cu&s;tom, ordered mats to be &s;pread for them, and plaintains, bananoes, and cocoa-nuts, to be brought by way of refre&s;hment. He then entered into di&s;cour&s;e with them; pre&s;&s;ed them to bring their &s;hips into harbour, and treated them in every re&s;pect with great apparent kindne&s;s, though he had been repre&s;ented by Tupia to former voy|agers as little better than a common robber. Being told that they were in ha&s;te to &s;ail, and that they could not &s;tay to come into harbour, he en|tered upon bu&s;ine&s;s; and after directing them to the place where the anchor lay, he told them, that one part of the purcha&s;e mu&s;t be a ewe; that he had a ram, which had been pre&s;ented to him by &s;ome &s;trangers, who had lately vi&s;ited his i&s;land, and who had left him a ewe, but &s;he was dead. Capt. Cook in&s;tantly ordered a ewe to be brought from the &s;hip, for which, and four large axes, he purcha&s;ed the anchor, weighing about 700 pound weight. Capt. Cook makes no mention of the ewe, but enlarges the quantity of the other pur|cha&s;e. They then took leave, and having brought the anchor on board, both &s;hips &s;et &s;ail, &s;teering, N. by F.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of Ulietea, which we had ju&s;t left, has nothing in it that differs e&s;&s;entially from what is to be met with in the other i&s;lands, only that the women have more liberty here than at Otaheite, and are not re&s;trained from eating in company with the men. While here, we were vi&s;ited by the King and his Chiefs. Gave and received en|tertainments. We attended their plays, and, in return, amu&s;ed them with fireworks, illuminations, and other diver&s;ions, in the &s;ame manner as at the other i&s;lands, and remarked very little difference in the characteri&s;tics of the natives.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="251">As we were now taking our leave for ever of tho&s;e fertile i&s;les, we added to our live-&s;tock more than 100 hogs, which we found would eat after they had recovered the &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. In the for|mer voyages, it was not known that hogs would not eat while they were &s;ick; it was therefore thought prudent to kill them, after fa&s;ting three or four days, from a belief that, having fa&s;ted &s;o long, they would never eat again; and, if they died of them&s;elves, none of the crew would eat carrion.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Containing an Account of what happened in pro&s;e|cuting the Voyage to the North, to determine the Exi&s;tence or Non-exi&s;tence of a Pa&s;&s;age between the great Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in that He|mi&s;phere.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAVING taken leave of the i&s;lands with which we were before acquainted in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, we now directed our cour&s;e to the northward, to explore coa&s;ts and countries hitherto unvi&s;ited by any Engli&s;h voyager, and but lately known to the navigators of other countries.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="252">We took our departure from the Society I&s;les, as has already been &s;aid, on the 9th of December, 1777, &s;teering N. by E. as near as the winds would let us, with mo&s;tly fine weather till the 20th, when in lat. 4.54. S. we were &s;urrounded with land and &s;ea weeds, and bodies of trees, which &s;eemed to be but lately &s;eparated from their re|&s;pective roots; but it was not till</P>
<P>The 23d that we di&s;covered land. On that day, in lat. 2. N. long. 203.15. E. after having cro&s;&s;ed the line the day before, the man at the ma&s;t-head called out land, bearing N. E. di&s;tance between &s;ix and &s;even leagues. We in&s;tantly wore &s;hip, and &s;tood in for a fine bay, on which we found good anchorage in 48 fathom water. On viewing the i&s;land from the &s;hips, there did not appear the lea&s;t &s;ign of an inhabitant; but near the &s;hore there were &s;hoals of &s;harks, and the &s;ea &s;eemed cru&s;ted over with &s;ea-fowls, &s;ome of a very large &s;ize. The boats that had been &s;ent out to reconnoitre returned in the evening with one large turtle each, and loaded with boobies and other tro|pical birds, that by hungry mariners are generally e&s;teemed good eating. They likewi&s;e brought &s;everal &s;harks, which they found in &s;uch crowds, that they knocked them on the head with their oars.</P>
<P>On the 24th we changed our &s;tation, and an|chored in 17 fathom water.</P>
<P>And on the 25th we kept Chri&s;tmas in much mirth and fe&s;tivity, the crew having plenty of provi&s;ions, and the Gentlemen plenty of turtle. The &s;hips being &s;afely moored, and the weather fine, but almo&s;t in&s;upportably hot, the men were allowed the whole day to amu&s;e them&s;elves, and every one had a pint of brandy to make merry, and drink health to their friends in Old England.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="253">In the evening, parties from both &s;hips were invited to go a turtling, but none were pre&s;&s;ed into that &s;ervice, all were volunteers. On our landing, the crews went different ways; and in order to know where to meet, fires were made in &s;eparate directions; one fire for the Re&s;olution's party, and one for that of the Di&s;covery's. Our party before morning had turned more than 20 turtles, and had carried them on board; and when the boats were unloaded, returned for more. In the mean time, a fi&s;hing party were likewi&s;e &s;ent out, and were no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful than the turtlers; hut on this &s;ervice a &s;eaman had a very narrow e&s;cape. As he was helping to draw the &s;eine, a &s;hark made a chop at his arm, but fortunately caught only a piece of his &s;hirt's &s;leeve, with which he made off.</P>
<P>The Re&s;olution's turtlers had made a trip to their &s;hip to unlade; but on the return of their boats to the i&s;land, one of their men was mi&s;&s;ing, who, tired with carrying a turtle of more than 100 weight in the heat of the day, had laid it down on the beech, and retired to a thicket, to &s;helter him&s;elf from the &s;un. Here he fell a&s;leep, and as &s;oon as he awoke, be endeavoured to recover his turtle, but in vain; he had entangled him&s;elf among the bu&s;hes, and in the evening, after a mo&s;t painful &s;earch, he was found almo&s;t &s;peechle&s;s through fatigue and want of refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>All this day our people continued their diver|sion on the S. E. &s;ide of the i&s;land; but</P>
<P>On the 26th, about ten in the morning, Mr. B&mdash;y, Mr. E&mdash;r, and Mr. P&mdash;k, with ten or twelve &s;eamen in the cutter, having a good quantity of water on board, and each man a pint of brandy, directed their cour&s;e to the N. E. quar|ter, and about noon arrived at a neck of land,
<PB N="180" REF="254">
over which they were to travel on foot to come at the place where the turtle were &s;uppo&s;ed to har|bour, and where it was dangerous to attempt to approach them by &s;ea by rea&s;on of the &s;urf. Here they &s;afely &s;ecured their cutter, and near the &s;hore they erected a kind of hut, to which they carried their provi&s;ions, and &s;at down to re&s;t and to refre&s;h. This done, they agreed to divide, and to pur&s;ue their &s;port in &s;eparate parties. Accordingly they &s;et out, and before the next morning they had &s;ent in as many turtle as the cutter could well &s;tow. This they did by placing them acro&s;s a couple of oars in the nature of a bier, and keeping men em|ployed in conveying them from the place where they were turned, to the cutter. As they grew tired of their diver&s;ion, they repaired to the place of rendezvous; but it was &s;ome &s;urprize to the re&s;t, when at nine in the morning, Mr. B&mdash;y, Mr. P&mdash;k and Simeon Woodrooff, the gunner's mate, was mi&s;&s;ing. It was then concluded that they had gone too far within land, and that they had either lo&s;t their way, or &s;ome accident had be|fallen them; perhaps from natives lurking &s;ecretly in the woods, though none had openly appeared.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e apprehen&s;ions two &s;eamen, Bar|tholomew Loremer and Thomas Trecher were &s;ent out in &s;earch of them, each carrying a gallon of water, with brandy and other refreshments, in ca&s;e they &s;hould meet with the Gentlemenn their way. In a wild uncultivated country, over-run with bu&s;hes and clo&s;e cover, the reader, who has never been bewildered in a full-grown thicket after &s;port, can have no idea of men's being lo&s;t in the &s;hort &s;pace of a few miles. So, however it happened. The Gentlemen, invited by the mixed melody of the birds in the woods, left the&s;e people as &s;oon as they had properly &s;tationed them,
<PB N="181" REF="255">
and entered an adjoining thicket, with their guns. The &s;port they met with led them on till night began to clo&s;e upon them. They were then at a di&s;tance from the turtlers, and in the mid&s;t a trackle&s;s cover, with nothing but lew trees to di|rect their return; but what was more alarming, the &s;un was no &s;ooner &s;et, than a thick fog &s;uc|ceeded, which involved the woods in darkne&s;s, though the open beach remained clear. In vain they attempted to regain the &s;hore; for, in&s;tead, of being able to di&s;cern the trees they had marked to &s;ecure their retreat, they could hardly &s;ee one another at five yards di&s;tance. In this &s;ituation, they &s;oon began to lo&s;e all knowledge of their way; and le&s;t, in&s;tead of proceeding in the right cour&s;e, they &s;hould pur&s;ue a contrary direction, they agreed to &s;it down to re&s;t, and for that pur|po&s;e cho&s;e the fir&s;t convenient &s;pot that chance threw in their way. Though their minds were troubled, they had &s;carce &s;et them&s;elves down, when &s;leep got the better of their anxiety, and they all lay compo&s;ed till attacked by &s;warms of black ants, (creatures more poi&s;onous than bugs) with which they were in a manner covered when they awoke; and &s;o disfigured and tormented with their bites and bli&s;ters, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to desribe their di&s;tre&s;s. Thus circumstanced, their fir&s;t care was to clear them&s;elves from the&s;e vermin, by &s;tripping them&s;elves, and &s;weeping them off with bru&s;hes made of the wings of the birds they had killed; this done, they clothed them&s;elves again, in order to renew their atttempts to recover the &s;hore; but all in vain. The farther they walked, as it appeared afterwards, the farther they went a&s;tray. At length, &s;u&s;pecting their error, they re&s;olved to remain &s;tationary; and each man, placing him&s;elf again&s;t an adjoining tree, endea|voured
<PB N="182" REF="256">
to con&s;ole him&s;elf as well as he could till morning, when the appearance of the &s;un &s;hould enable them to judge of the cour&s;e they were to pur&s;ue; but in a trackle&s;s wilderne&s;s how were they to make their way! The thicket in many places was overgrown with thick gra&s;s and bram|bles reaching; to their middles, and in others &s;o thick inter&s;ected with boughs, and matted with leaves, that it was hardly possible to keep com|pany, or to penetrate with their utmo&s;t efforts, when the&s;e obstructions happened) one hundred yards in as many minutes. Still, however, la|bouring to advance, they, at length, all at once, ob&s;erved an opening that led, as they thought, to the long-wi&s;hed for &s;hore. They forgot, for the moment, the pains of their lacerated limbs, though all torn with briars and be&s;meared with blood, and comforted them&s;elves with the hope of a &s;peedy deliverance. But they had &s;till a journey of about &s;even or eight miles to perform, before they could reach the place from whence they &s;et out. Almo&s;t &s;pent with fatigue, and their &s;pirits wa&s;ted with the mo&s;t painful exertion of bodily &s;trength, without having a drop of water to quench their intolerable thir&s;t, they at length arrived at the hut, when, to their great mortification, they found it de&s;erted, and de&s;titute of every kind of refre&s;hment. In this &s;ituation ca&s;ting their eyes towards the &s;hips, they perceived the boats ha&s;tening to their relief. The officer who commanded, and the crew, had waited at the hut till all their provi&s;ions were ex|pended, and the officer not knowing how to pro|ceed, had repaired to the &s;hip for a fre&s;h &s;upply, and for fre&s;h orders, and was now returning fully furni&s;hed and in&s;tructed. On his arrival he was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ight of three &s;uch mi&s;erable beings, as the Gentlemen and Mate
<PB N="183" REF="257">
appeared to be, lacerated all over, and be&s;meared with blood, and with &s;carce a rag about them broad|er than a garter. Their cry was for grog, which was dealt to them &s;paringly, and they were in|&s;tantly &s;ent on board to be properly taken care of.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t enquiry they made, was, whether any of the company had been &s;ent after them; and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, and that they were not yet returned, they could not help ex|pre&s;&s;ing their doubts whether they ever would return; adding their wi&s;hes at the &s;ame time, that no means might be omitted to endeavour their recovery.</P>
<P>It is natural for men, who have ju&s;t experienced any &s;ignal deliverance, to feel poignantly for the &s;afety of others under the &s;ame critical circum&s;tances. It was therefore no &s;mall &s;atisfaction to the &s;uf|ferers, when they were told, that every po&s;&s;ible means would be tried for the poor men's relief; and to enable tho&s;e who were to be &s;ent on that errand the better to direct their &s;earch, the gen|tlemen de&s;cribed, as well as they could, the &s;pot where they thought they heard men halloo to one another about the dawn of day. There were now twenty of the crew (&s;eamen and marines) who had been di&s;patched from on board, for recover|ing the gentlemen. The&s;e had orders to traver&s;e the thickets in a body, till they &s;hould find one or other of them, either living or dead; for, till the gentlemen appeared, nothing could be concluded with certainty concerning them. The majority were of opinion, that, if they had been alive, they mo&s;t certainly would have returned as &s;oon as it was dark, as they could have no motive to pur&s;ue their &s;port in the night; and it was by no means probable, that they &s;hould be bewil|dered, becau&s;e they might &s;urely have found
<PB N="184" REF="258">
the &s;ame way out of the cover, by which they went into it. This was very plau&s;ible; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> on board, who had &s;ailed with Commodore Byron, and who remembered the almo&s;t impenetrable thickets in the i&s;land of Tinian, where men could not &s;ee one another in open day, at the di&s;tance of five yards, knew well how the gentlemen might be entangled, and how hard it would fare with them if it &s;hould &s;o happen. But, as this in&s;tance was known only to few, it was regarded by none; and the former opinion, that &s;ome fa|tal accident had happened to them, prevailed ge|nerally till the gentlemen appeared, when the whole my&s;tery was unravelled.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the next day, (the two men being &s;till mi&s;&s;ing) the whole party a&s;&s;em|bled, and the plan of their proceeding was form|ed. By marching in lines at &s;uch a di&s;tance from each other, as to be within hearing, it was thought impo&s;&s;ible to fail of finding the men, if living, or of di&s;covering &s;ome traces of them, if dead: and they were to direct their line of march to|wards the &s;pot where the &s;ound of the voices was heard by the gentlemen.</P>
<P>After a diligent &s;earch of &s;ix hours, Bartholo|mew Loreman was di&s;covered in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable condition, almo&s;t blinded by the venomous bites of vermin, added to the &s;corching heat of the &s;un, and &s;peechle&s;s for want of &s;omething to clear his throat. He made &s;igns for water, and water was given him. He had got out of the thicket, and was wandering about upon the beech, without being &s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;erable condition in which he was found. It fortunately happened, that a boat from the Di&s;covery had been &s;ent round the point of land already mentioned, and &s;tationed near where the turtlers had been employed the
<PB N="185" REF="259">
night before, for the purpo&s;e of taking the gentlemen on board, in ca&s;e they &s;hould have been &s;trayed to any con&s;iderable di&s;tance. If this precaution had not been taken, this man mu&s;t have peri&s;hed before he could have been conveyed by any other means to the place of rendezvous; and it was with the utmo&s;t dif|ficulty that he was carried to the neare&s;t boat. As &s;oon as he could be brought to his &s;peech, he &s;aid he had parted from his companion Trecher in the morning, not in anger, but not agreeing about the way back, nor ever expecting to &s;ee one another again. They had traver&s;ed the thicket as long as they were able, in &s;earch of the gentlemen without &s;ucce&s;s; and when over|come with fatigue, they &s;at down to refre&s;h, and he believed had drank a little too freely of the grog they had in charge, for they both fell a|&s;leep. They were frightened when they waked to find it dark night; and although they felt their faces and hands covered with vermin, the thoughts of having neglected their duty, and the dread of the con&s;equences &s;o di&s;tracted their minds, that they were hardly &s;en&s;ible of any other pain. As re&s;t was now no longer their object, they ro&s;e and wandered, they neither knew nor cared where, till day began to break upon them. In the mean time, &s;everal wild projects came into their heads. At la&s;t they thought of climbing the highe&s;t tree, to try if they could di&s;cover any hill or eminence, from whence they might take a view of the coun|try, in order to be certain whether it was inha|bited or not. This was approved of by both, and Trecher mounted the loftie&s;t within his reach, from whence he &s;aid he could di&s;cern, towards the South-we&s;t, a hill of con&s;iderable height; and as that was, as he thought, the point that led to the
<PB N="186" REF="260">
&s;hore, thither he propo&s;ed that they &s;hould go; but Loreman rather cho&s;e to endeavour to regain the &s;hore by another cour&s;e; and as he thought he heard the report of a gun the evening before, he determined to make towards the point from whence the &s;ound proceeded; and in that he hap|pened to judge right; and when he got out of the wood, being parched with thir&s;t, he killed a turtle and &s;ucked the blood. His companion, he &s;aid, who was at &s;ome di&s;tance farther in the thicket, and who did not hear the report of the gun, did not believe what he &s;aid; whereupon they agreed to part. What cour&s;e Trecher took he could not tell, but he believed to the South-we&s;t.</P>
<P>Loreman was judged in too dangerous a con|dition to admit of any delay; he was therefore &s;ent off in the boat, and being put under the care of the Surgeon, &s;oon recovered.</P>
<P>After this detail it was debated, whether to re&s;ign Trecher to his fate, or to continue the &s;earch. The humanity of the officer, who had the command of the party, prevailed. It was now about ten in the morning, of the 29th, when the whole party, after taking &s;ome refre&s;hment, &s;et out to &s;cour the thickets, and, by hallooing, ringing of bells, beating of drums, and pur&s;u|ing different cour&s;es, determined he &s;hould hear them if he were alive. It was no ea&s;y ta&s;k to pe|netrate a trackle&s;s cover, over-grown with un|derwood, and abounding with infects, of which the mu&s;quitoes were the lea&s;t trouble&s;ome. But numbers make that ea&s;y, which to individuals would be impracticable. They went on chear|fully at fir&s;t; but, before a few hours were elap&s;|ed, even the gentlemen, who were in&s;pirited by their &s;ucce&s;s in killing game, began to be tired, and it was thought advi&s;eable to re&s;t and refre&s;h
<PB N="187" REF="261">
during the middle of the day, and to renew the pur&s;uit after they had dined. As yet they had not been able to di&s;cover any trace or track of the man they were &s;eeking, though it had been a|greed between Trecher and his companion, to cut boughs from the trees, as they pa&s;&s;ed along, by way of mark or guide to each other, in ca&s;e of &s;eparation.</P>
<P>This was no &s;mall di&s;couragement; and few had any reli&s;h to renew a labour attended with &s;o much fatigue, and &s;o little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The officers were alone inflexibly bent on the pur&s;uit. The men, though they were no le&s;s willing, were not all equally able to endure the fatigue; and &s;ome of them were even ready to drop, before their dinner and their grog had revived their &s;pirits. The only expedient that now remained to be tried, was, that which Tre|cher him&s;elf had projected, namely, to climb the highe&s;t tree that appeared in view, in order to look for the hill which he pretended to have &s;een, and to which it was thought probable that he might direct his cour&s;e. This was no &s;ooner propo&s;ed than executed. In a moment a &s;ailor was perched at the top of every lofty tree in &s;ight, and the high land de&s;cried, &s;eemingly at no great di&s;tance from the place where the party had din|ed. It was now agreed, to make the be&s;t of their way to the eminence, but this proved not &s;o ea&s;y a ta&s;k as it at fir&s;t appeared to be. When they thought them&s;elves ju&s;t ready to mount, they met with a lagoon that interrupted their progre&s;s; and coa&s;ting it along, they di&s;covered the &s;kele|ton of a creature that, by its length, appeared to be an allegator. In viewing this narrowly, &s;omething like the track of &s;ome large animal was ob&s;erved to have pa&s;&s;ed it, and the high gra&s;s
<PB N="188" REF="262">
on the margin of the lagoon to have been fre&s;h trodden. This excited the curio&s;ity of the whole party, who imagined that &s;ome mon&s;ter inhabit|ed the lagoon, again&s;t which it was prudent for them to be upon their guard. The waters of the lagoon were &s;alt as brine, and every where &s;kirted with a kind of reed and &s;edge, that reach|ed as high as a man's head, and could not be pe|netrated without danger from &s;corpions or other venomous reptiles, &s;everal of which had been &s;een in the bu&s;hes. All attempts therefore of &s;uc|ceeding by this cour&s;e appeared to be labour lo&s;t; and as no other were thought more probable, it was re&s;olved to relinqui&s;h the pur&s;uit, and to re|turn to the boats: but the day being already too far &s;pent to make their return practicable be|fore the morning, it was agreed to coa&s;t it along the lake, to endeavour to find acce&s;s to the op|po&s;ite hills; and this was the more ea&s;ily effect|ed, as between the &s;edgey border and the thicket there was an open &s;pace of unequal breadth, only &s;ometimes inter&s;ected with brambley patches that joined the lake, but of no great extent. Through the&s;e they made their way with little oppo&s;ition till the lake appeared to deepen, when a mo&s;t &s;tubborn woody cop&s;e &s;eemed to bid de|fiance to their further progre&s;s. This difficulty, however, was with much labour &s;urmounted, and it was no &s;ooner pa&s;&s;ed, than the lake was found to terminate, and the ground to ri&s;e. The coun|try began now to put on a new face. The pro|&s;pect which had hitherto pre&s;ented nothing but a wild and almost impenetrable thicket, as they a&s;cended the ri&s;ing ground, became delightful. And when they had attained the &s;ummit of the eminence, was exceedingly picture&s;que. Here they determined to pa&s;s the night within a plea|&s;ant
<PB N="189" REF="263">
grove, which &s;eemed to be de&s;igned by na|ture for a place of re&s;t. The whole party now a&s;&s;embled, and orders were given by the com|manding officers to erect temporary huts to &s;hel|ter them from the evening damps. The&s;e huts were only boughs and leaves of trees &s;et up tent fa&s;hion. In this &s;ervice &s;ome were employed in cutting down and preparing the materials, while others were bu&s;ied in di&s;pos&s;ing and putting them together; &s;ome were ordered to collect fuel, and others to carry it to the &s;ummit of an adjoining hill, in order to be kindled at the clo&s;e of day, and kept burning during the night, by way of &s;ignal, to let the man know, if alive, where to re|pair; and the &s;hips, that the party were &s;afe. Be|fore night &s;et in the huts were completed, the fire was lighted, the &s;entinel at his &s;tation, the watch &s;et, and the party all retired to re&s;t, when, about the dead of night, the &s;entinel who attend|ed the fire, was &s;urprized by a four-footed mon|&s;ter. This mon&s;ter, upon examination, proved no other, than the identical Thomas Trecher, of whom they had been in &s;earch &s;o long, crawling upon all &s;ours; for his feet were &s;o bli&s;tered, that he could not &s;tand, and his throat &s;o parched that he could not &s;peak. It is hard to &s;ay which was predominant, their joy, their &s;urprize, or their laughter. No time, however, was lo&s;t in admini&s;tering comfort to the poor man. He was a mo&s;t affecting &s;pectacle, bli&s;tered from head to foot by poi&s;onous in&s;ects, who&s;e venomous &s;tings had cau&s;ed &s;uch an intolerable itching, that his very blood was inflamed by con&s;tant rubbing. By anointing him with oil, the acrimony, in &s;ome degree, abated; and by frequently giving him &s;mall quantities of tea, mixed with a little brandy, they brought him to his &s;peech; but it was &s;ome
<PB N="190" REF="264">
days before he recovered the perfect u&s;e of his faculties.</P>
<P>The ab&s;ence the whole night of the party &s;ent out in &s;earch of him, having been reported to Capt. Cook, he had ordered two boats into the lagoon, to go different ways, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;earch; but being in the evening relieved from his anxiety, he recalled the boats, and gave orders to prepare for &s;ailing.</P>
<P>We had now been off this i&s;land near 7 days, in which time we had taken more than 300 turtle, from 90 to 100 lb. weight on board. But tho' it &s;eemed more than 60 leagues in circumference, there were not the &s;malle&s;t traces of any human being having ever been upon it before: and, in|deed, &s;hould any people be &s;o unfortunate as to be accidentally driven upon it, they could not po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t for any length of time. There are, it is true, many birds, and abundance of fi&s;h, but no vi&s;ible means of allaying thir&s;t, nor any vege|table that could &s;upply the place of bread. On the few cocoa-trees upon the i&s;land, the number of which did not exceed thirty, very little fruit was found; and in general, what was found, was either not fully grown, or had the juice &s;alt or bracki&s;h; &s;o that a &s;hip touching here, mu&s;t ex|pect nothing but fi&s;h and turtle; but not a drop of fre&s;h water was to be found throughout the i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 1st of January, 1778, about ten in the morning, we unmoored, and &s;et &s;ail, with the Re|&s;olution in company, directing our cour&s;e N. by E. with a gentle breeze from the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>To the i&s;land which we had ju&s;t left, Capt. Cook gave the name of Chri&s;tmas I&s;land, leaving in it a bottle, with a &s;imilar in&s;cription to that cut on Omai's hou&s;e, the date only excepted. It lies
<PB N="191" REF="265">
in lat. 1.59. N. and in long. 201. E. from Green|wich. It is a low barren i&s;land, and has all the appearance of having been blighted. The few co|coa-nut trees that were found upon it, produced hardly any fruit, and, except a few on the bor|ders of the lagoon already mentioned, what they bore were without kernels.</P>
<P>Early on the 2d of January, Chri&s;tmas I&s;land bore S. S. E. as far as the eye could carry, and as we were now clear of land, and proceeding with a pro&s;perous gale, and had plenty of provi&s;ions on board, the men were allowed turtle to boil with their pork; which, however, in a few days was di&s;conti|nued by the advice of the Surgeon, and turtle &s;ub|&s;tituted in the room of every other kind of meat. This was found both healthful and nouri&s;hing, and was continued till within a few days of our arrival at another i&s;land, where we met with fre&s;h provi&s;ions, and water equal to any we brought with us from the Society I&s;les.</P>
<P>On the 3d, the wind &s;hifted W. S. W. and a &s;torm came on, preceded by a louring darkne&s;s, that pre&s;aged &s;ome violent convul&s;ion; and &s;oon after it broke forth in thunder, lightning, wind, and rain, which in two hours increa&s;ed to &s;uch a violent degree, as no man on board had ever known the like. Fortunately for us, its violence in a few hours abated; but in that little time the &s;ea broke over our quarter, and cleared the decks of every thing that was loo&s;e. Before noon, the wind &s;ub&s;ided, but the rain continued till evening, of which we made good u&s;e. From the time of our leaving Ulietea to the pre&s;ent day, we had received no fre&s;h &s;upply of water; and, though the &s;till had been con&s;tantly at work, our comple|ment began already to run &s;canty. This after|noon, &s;everal indications of land were ob&s;erved;
<PB N="192" REF="266">
&s;uch as great quantities of &s;ea-weed floating about the &s;hips, and fre&s;h timber driving with the cur|rent. The Re&s;olution made the &s;ignal to &s;horten &s;ail and &s;tand to the Southward, which was obeyed; but, no land coming in &s;ight while it was day-light, after eight hours &s;earch we left off the pur&s;uit, and re&s;umed our cour&s;e to the North|ward, which we continued till</P>
<P>The 13th, when, in lat. 13.3. long. 202.6. we &s;teered to the N. W. in &s;earch of land, the &s;igns of which were very &s;triking; but, after continuing that cour&s;e all night without &s;ucceed|ing, we again &s;tood to the North. From this time till</P>
<P>The 20th, nothing material happened, &s;ome &s;light &s;torms excepted; we &s;hall therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="3+ letters">me our relation of what occurred to Trecher, from the time that he parted from his companion, on the 29th of December, till the night he was found on the 3d.</P>
<P>It was, as has already been ob&s;erved, &s;everal days, before he could perfectly recollect all that pa&s;&s;ed in his mind, and all that he &s;uffered in his per&s;on. He confirmed Loreman's relation of what pa&s;&s;ed while they remained together; but, in the morning of the 29th, when they agreed to part, his thoughts ran chiefly on di&s;covering &s;ome hou&s;e or place of re&s;ort of the natives, as it ran &s;trongly in his mind, that an i&s;land of &s;uch extent as that appeared to be, could not be wholly de&s;|titute of inhabitants. In pur&s;uit of this idea, he determined to make towards the hill or high land, which he had &s;een from the top of the tree; and to ob&s;erve the cour&s;e of the &s;un for his guide, but he met with many ob&s;tructions that retarded his progre&s;s. The reeds and the rough gra&s;s were in many places &s;o high and thick, that he was almo&s;t
<PB N="193" REF="267">
&s;uffocated in attempting to get through them, and was frequently obliged to return, when he thought he had nearly reached the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Though there were &s;erpents, and, he believed, &s;corpions, continually bi&s;&s;ing, in almo&s;t all directions, the fear of being &s;tung by them was ab&s;orbed by the more immediate torture he felt from the mu&s;qui|toes, and other venomous in&s;ects, that fa&s;tened upon him, and teized him ince&s;&s;antly; add to the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, the bad condition of his &s;hoes, which were worn to &s;hreds; and, though he tied them round and round with cords made of twi&s;ted gra&s;s, yet it was hardly po&s;&s;ible for him to keep them upon his feet for ten &s;teps together. In this melancholy &s;ituation, re&s;t was a &s;tranger to him; yet &s;leep would &s;ometimes clo&s;e his eyes, and fill his imagination with horrors &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than tho&s;e he felt while awake. To|wards the evening of the 29th, he thought he heard the howling of dogs; and, a-while after, the growling of &s;ome &s;avage bea&s;t, but of what &s;pecies he could not tell; however, he &s;aw no|thing, and the&s;e might only be the creatures of his own di&s;turbed fancy. Towards night he got to|gether a quantity of broad leaves from the trees to make him a bed, and to cover his face and hands from the black ants. To allay his thir&s;t, he thought of chewing the &s;tems of a reed, that had a &s;accharine ta&s;te, and was probably a wild kind of &s;ugar-cane, which gave him &s;ome re|fre&s;hment, and contributed not a little to his pre|&s;ervation. Soon as day began to dawn, he found him&s;elf weak and languid, and had very little &s;tomach to renew his labour. His fir&s;t care, how|ever, was to repair his &s;hoes. This he did by forming wi&s;ps of gra&s;s into the &s;hape of &s;oals, and placing them underneath the remains of the lea|ther
<PB N="194" REF="268">
&s;oals. He then tied them together round his feet and ankles with cords, made as before; and with the&s;e he made &s;hift to &s;cramble on a-while, but they &s;oon wanted repair. He again had re|cour&s;e to his fir&s;t expedient, and mounted a tree that over-topped the cover, and got &s;ight of the high land that fir&s;t animated his pur&s;uit. He thought it &s;o near that he could &s;oon reach it; and, ha&s;tening down, made his way with more alacrity than ever, being prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that if he reached that eminence, his deliverance would be certain. For &s;ome hours he &s;truggled through the most formidable ob&s;tacles, the cover being now &s;o thick and &s;trong, and withal &s;o high, that he could hardly &s;ee the light over his head through the leaves and the bu&s;hes. This happened to be the outer border that &s;kirted the lagoon, which when he had penetrated, and found an opening, his heart leaped within him; but his joy was or &s;hort duration. He pre&s;ently di&s;covered that he had another difficulty to furmount, before he could reach the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes. He at|tempted the lagoon, and waded nearly acro&s;s, without the water ri&s;ing higher than his middle, but all at once plunged over-head in deep water, and it was next to a miracle that he &s;aved him&s;elf from drowning. He then returned quite ex|hau&s;ted and dejected, and breaking through the &s;edge of the margin of the lake, he &s;tumbled upon the &s;keleton of the mon&s;ter already men|tioned, which he believed was fifty feet long. He was &s;o &s;cared at the fight of the bones, that his hair &s;tood on-end, and he thought of nothing now but being eaten up alive. Totally di&s;pirited, and faint for want of food or any thing to drink, and deprived of all means of proceeding any far|ther, he crept along the lake till he came to a
<PB N="195" REF="269">
cocoa-nut tree near the edge of the thicket, which he attempted to climb, but fell down for want of &s;trength to keep his hold, and lay for &s;everal hours incapable of motion. He heard, he &s;aid, a noi&s;e in the cover, in the day, but could neither halloo to be heard, nor follow the &s;ound, though &s;ome of the company mu&s;t have pa&s;&s;ed very near him; but &s;eeing the fire lighted on the hill in the even|ing, it encouraged him to make one &s;truggle more for life. Without a &s;hoe to his foot, having lo&s;t them in the lake, he made &s;hift to crawl up the hill, as already related. Few readers will think it po&s;&s;ible for a man to &s;uffer &s;o much in &s;o &s;hort a time; and yet many have lo&s;t their lives by be|ing bewildered in England, and many more on the wild heaths in Scotland, which cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to be &s;o dangerous as the thick cover of a de&s;olate i&s;land, where no man ever &s;et his foot be|fore. But, be that as it may, &s;uch is the account given by Trecher, of his &s;ufferings during the three days he was ab&s;ent from the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Having now been 17 days at &s;ea, without &s;ee|ing land,</P>
<P>On the 18th, a very &s;evere &s;torm aro&s;e, which blew with irre&s;tible fury for &s;ome hours, and obliged us to clue up our main &s;heets, and &s;cud bofore it, at the rate of &s;even or eight knots an hour; but before noon the wind died away, and a dead calm &s;ucceeded. Such is the variablene&s;s of the weather near the tropics.</P>
<P>On the 19th, being then in lat. 21.12. N. and long. 200.41. E. the man at the ma&s;t-head called out, High land, bearing E. N. E. and in a very little time came in &s;ight of more land, apparently of an equal height with the former. As we ap|proached the windward i&s;land, it pre&s;ented no very promi&s;ing a&s;pect, being mountainous, and
<PB N="196" REF="270">
&s;urrounded with reefs, without any &s;igns of inha|bitants; we therefore &s;tood off and on till</P>
<P>The 20th, when we bore away for the land to leeward, but not then in &s;ight.</P>
<P>About nine in the morning, it was &s;een the &s;e|cond time, at the di&s;tance of about &s;even or eight leagues. We were charmed with its ap|pearance as we came near it, ob&s;erving it to abound with rivers, and to exhibit a pro&s;pect &s;o full of plenty, that we anticipated the plea&s;ure we expected, by &s;uppo&s;ing our&s;elves already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply. We had been for &s;everal days reduced to the &s;canty allow|ance of a quart of water a-day, and that none of the be&s;t; and now that we &s;aw, or thought we &s;aw, whole rivers before us, our hearts were di|lated with joy; yet we had &s;till much to &s;uffer. We found our&s;elves debarred from the thing we were mo&s;t in want of for &s;everal days, by &s;hoals and rocks that to us were impracticable. We coa&s;ted along the N. W. &s;ide of the i&s;land, &s;ound|ing as we went, while the boats from both &s;hips were employed in &s;earching for &s;ome bay or har|bour, where we might &s;afely anchor. In the mean time, &s;everal canoes came from the &s;hore with plantains and dried fi&s;h on board, who parted with what they had for any trifles that were offered them; and at fir&s;t behaved with great civility, but could not be per&s;uaded to venture on board. At five in the evening, we were two leagues from the &s;hore, &s;urrounded by Indians in their canoes, with hogs in abundance, &s;ome very large, which we purcha&s;ed according to their &s;ize, for a &s;pike or a ten-penny nail each.</P>
<P>While we remained at &s;ea, no people on earth could be more friendly; but our boats had no &s;ooner landed, than a quarrel aro&s;e between the
<PB N="197" REF="271">
natives and our people, which was terminated by the death of one of the former. It was &s;aid that the Indians were the aggre&s;&s;ors, by throwing &s;tones at the boats to prevent the people from landing, and that orders being given to fire a gun over the heads of the a&s;&s;ailants, without doing them any hur; tin&s;tead of commanding re&s;pect, it only en|couraged them in in&s;olence, till Mr. W&mdash;, our third Lieutenant, pre&s;enting his piece, &s;hot one of the ringleaders dead upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>This early act of &s;everity was probably the means of &s;aving many lives. The Indians di&s;per&s;ed immediately, carrying off the dead body with them. And the boats, not having made any di&s;|covery, returned to the &s;hips, where they were taken on board, and &s;ecured till next morning.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t the boats were again &s;ent out, but to as little purpo&s;e as before. Little trade was this day carried on, as the natives &s;eemed very &s;hy. But,</P>
<P>On the 22d, the &s;hips having found anchorage on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide, they were no &s;ooner moored than they were again &s;urrounded with a more numerous multitude of i&s;landers than before, who &s;eemed to expre&s;s the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at the greatne&s;s of our &s;hips; nor did it appear that they had ever &s;een an European &s;hip before, though they were not wholly unacquainted with the u&s;e of iron. Mo&s;t of their canoes were laden with hogs, plantains, bananoes and &s;weet potatoes, which they readily exchanged chiefly for iron. Here the &s;ailors were &s;uffered to make what pur|cha&s;es they plea&s;ed; only women were prohibited by Capt. Cook's order, on the &s;evere&s;t penalties.&mdash;This caution, which was undoubtedly dictated by humanity, to prevent the introduction of a loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e among an innocent people,
<PB N="198" REF="272">
created a general murmur among the &s;eamen, who&s;e plea&s;ure was centered in that kind of com|merce, in the new di&s;covered i&s;lands, wherever they went.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the pinnace was ordered out, and the two Captains landed on the beach, where they were met by the Chiefs of the i&s;land, and more than 2000 of their &s;ubjects, not in a ho&s;tile manner, but in amity, exchanging pre&s;ents, and e&s;tabli&s;hing trade.</P>
<P>Capt. Cook made &s;igns for water, and was con|ducted to a mo&s;t delightful pool, &s;o conveniently &s;ituated for &s;upplying the &s;hips, that, had not the Re&s;olution been driven from her moorings by the violence of an ea&s;terly wind and strong current, nothing could have exceeded our entertainment at this ho&s;pitable port. We met with no ob&s;truc|tion in watering. The&s;e people merited our be&s;t commendations in their commercial intercour&s;e, never once attempting to cheat us, either a&s;hore, or along-&s;ide the &s;hips. Some of them, indeed, at fir&s;t betrayed a thievi&s;h di&s;po&s;ition; or rather they thought, that they had a right to every thing they could lay their hands on; but we &s;oon convinced them, that this conduct was not to be &s;uffered with impunity. One of our vi&s;itors, in the cour&s;e of trade, offered &s;ome fi&s;h-hooks to &s;ell. He was ob&s;erved to have a &s;mall parcel tied to the &s;tring of one of them, which he &s;eparated with great care, and re&s;erved for him&s;elf. Being a&s;ked what it was, he pointed to his belly, and &s;poke &s;ome|thing, which we could not under&s;tand; at the &s;ame time &s;aying it was bad, as if he did not wi&s;h to an&s;wer any more que&s;tions about it. On &s;eeing him &s;o anxious to conceal the contents, he was re|que&s;ted to open it, which he did with great re|luctance. They found that it contained a thin

bit of fle&s;h, which to appearance had been dried, but was now wet with &s;alt water. It &s;truck us that it might be human fle&s;h, and the que&s;tion being put to him, he an&s;wered, that the fle&s;h was part of a man. Another of his countrymen, who &s;tood by, was then a&s;ked, whether it was their cu&s;tom to eat tho&s;e killed in battle, and he im|mediately an&s;wered in the affirmative. Other proofs were not wanting to confirm this abomi|nable practice; and al&s;o that they, like the Ota|heiteans, offered up human &s;acrifices. We found, indeed, upon further acquaintance, &s;uch a &s;imila|rity of language, manners, cu&s;toms, religious rites, and, in &s;hort, propen&s;ities of di&s;po&s;ition, as left us no room to doubt of their once having been one and the &s;ame people. When the Re&s;olution was forced to &s;ea &s;he had but half her complement of water; nor had &s;he fre&s;h provi&s;ions &s;ufficient to &s;upply her people for any length of time. We in the Di&s;|covery were more fortunate. In the evening of the 24th we could &s;ee the Re&s;olution to leeward eight or nine leagues; and in the mean time, while &s;he was beating up, we were employed in com|pleating our hold.</P>
<P>On the 24th, one of their great men paid a vi|&s;it to Capt. Clerke. He came off in a double canoe, and like the King of the Friendly I&s;lands, paid no regard to the &s;mall canoes that lay in her way, but run again&s;t them, or over them, with|out endeavouring in the lea&s;t to avoid them. His attendants helped him into the &s;hip, and placed him on the gangway, where they &s;tood round him, holding each other by the hands; nor would &s;uffer any one to come near him, but Capt. Clerke him&s;elf. He was a young man, clothed from head to foot, and accompanied by a young wo|man, &s;uppo&s;ed to be his wife. His name was &s;aid
<PB N="200" REF="275">
to be Tamahano. Capt. Clerke made him &s;ome &s;uitable pre&s;ents, and received from him in return, a large bowl, &s;upported by two figures of men, the carving of which, both as to de&s;ign and exe|cution, &s;hewed &s;ome degree of &s;kill. He could not be prevailed upon to go below; but after &s;taying &s;ome time in the &s;hip, he was carried again to his canoe, and returned to the i&s;land. The next day &s;everal me&s;&s;ages were received by Capt. Clerke, inviting him to return the vi&s;it; and acquainting him, that the Chief had provided a large pre&s;ent on that occa&s;ion; but being anxious to get to &s;ea and join the Re&s;olution, the Captain did not think it advi&s;eable to accept the invitation. This was the only Chief of note &s;een upon this i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 25th we were in readine&s;s to fail, and, having lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olution, we imagined that, not being able to fetch her former &s;tation, &s;he had bore away to another i&s;land, which had been &s;een to the N. W. distance about 10 or 12 leagues.</P>
<P>On the 26th we weighed, directing our cour&s;e to the N. W. but about ten in the morning, the man at the ma&s;t-head de&s;cried the Re&s;olution at a great di&s;tance, bearing S. by W. whereupon we in&s;tantly tacked, and &s;tood S. by E. to join our Commodore. This being effected, we remained &s;everal days beating up, but in vain, to regain our former birth.</P>
<P>On the 29th we bore away to another lee i&s;land, named Oneeheow, which abounded with hogs and fruit, and where the natives were equally ho&s;|pitable with tho&s;e we had ju&s;t left, and brought from the &s;hore every kind of provi&s;ion their coun|try produced; but, there being no water to be procured at a moderate di&s;tance, and the reefs being dangerous, and the &s;urf running high, Capt.

Cook, after &s;urveying the i&s;land, and taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in the name of his Royal Ma&s;ter, (calling the whole clu&s;ter Sandwich's I&s;les) was preparing to depart, when a &s;torm came on from the ea&s;tward, and again obliged the Re&s;olution to put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The Captain had already exchanged &s;everal pre&s;ents with the Chiefs of the i&s;land, and had, in particular, pre&s;ented a Chief with two &s;he-goats and a ram; and had received in return &s;ix large hogs, with a quantity of &s;alt, an article which, be|gan to be much wanted. He had likewi&s;e purcha&s;|ed all &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;hip's u&s;e, as the inha|bitants could &s;upply: and it was fortunate that he had &s;o done, before the &s;torm came on; for after|wards it would have been equally impo&s;&s;ible for him to have recovered his &s;tation here, as he had found it to regain his former birth in the other harbour. Our boats, while the &s;hore was acce&s;|&s;ible, were diligent in bringing on board the pro|duct of the i&s;land; &s;o that, on the evening of</P>
<P>The 1st of February we had more than 250 hogs on board, with &s;alt in abundance, be&s;ides three months allowance of &s;weet potatoes, bana|noes, plantains, &s;ugar-cane, and other provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Early in the morning on the 2d we weighed, and &s;oon came in &s;ight of the Re&s;olution; and both &s;hips left the i&s;land to pur&s;ue the voyage.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands, which lie between the latitude of 21.20. and 22.15. N. and long. 199.20. and 201.30. E. are not, in beauty and fertility, much inferior to the Friendly I&s;lands in the &s;outhern hemi&s;phere, nor are the inhabitants le&s;s ingenious or civilized. It is not a little a&s;toni&s;hing, there|fore, that they &s;hould remain &s;o long unknown to the Spaniards, as they lie, as it were, in the midway between Manilla and the We&s;tern Coa&s;ts of New
<PB N="202" REF="278">
Spain, and will now probably be their rendezvous for refre&s;hments. Except the fir&s;t quarrel that happened, of which we have already &s;poken, we had not the lea&s;t difference with any of the na|tives during our &s;tay. What they had to di&s;po&s;e of they parted with upon the ea&s;ie&s;t terms; nor did they &s;eem quite &s;o thievi&s;hly inclined as tho&s;e on the other &s;ide the line.</P>
<P>Every i&s;land in this group, of which there are more than we could count, appeared to be well peopled. In that which we fir&s;t vi&s;ited, called by the natives Ottooi, it was no uncommon thing to &s;ee between two and three thou&s;and of the natives a&s;&s;emble on the beech, when any thing was to be &s;hewn that excited their curio&s;ity. And there we learned the names of four other i&s;lands, viz. Woahoo, Oneeheow, Oreehowe, and Tahoora; the la&s;t inhabited by birds, of which there were, as we were told, incredible numbers.</P>
<P>The men in the&s;e i&s;lands are of the middle &s;ize, of a dark complexion, not much tattowed, but of a lively open countenance. They were no other|wi&s;e clothed than decency required; and what they had on appeared to be their own manufacture, of which there were various fabricks, and of a va|riety of colours. Some were made with borders exactly re&s;embling coverlets, and others appeared like printed cottons; and, be&s;ides cloth, they had many other articles which &s;hewed that they had artificers among them not wanting in inge|nuity. One peculiarity we ob&s;erved among the men, and that was, in the cut of their hair, which they trimmed up to a ridge along their heads, in form like what, in hor&s;es manes, is called hogging. Others again wore it long, plaiting it in tails, which hung below the wai&s;t; and the&s;e we took for marks of di&s;tinction among them. Add to
<PB N="203" REF="279">
this, a kind of cap and &s;hort cloak worn by their Chiefs, in &s;hape like tho&s;e worn by the Ladies in England, and compo&s;ed of feathers of different colours, ranged in rows, one over another, and narrowing from the lower border till they termi|nated in a kind of net-work round the neck. The brilliant colours of the feathers in tho&s;e that hap|pened to be new, added not a little to their fine appearance; and we found that they were in great e&s;timation with their owners, for they would not at fir&s;t part with one of them for any thing that we offered, a&s;king no le&s;s for each than a mu&s;ket. However, &s;ome were afterwards purcha&s;ed for very large nails. The be&s;t &s;ort was certainly &s;carce, and it &s;hould &s;eem, were only u&s;ed at their theatrical exhibitions, or other &s;olemnities. The cap is made like a helmet, and &s;its very clo&s;e, hav|ing notches to admit the ears. It is a frame of twigs and o&s;iers, covered with a net-work, into which are wrought feathers, in the &s;ame manner as in the cloaks. The&s;e, with the cloaks, probably compleat the theatrical dre&s;s.</P>
<P>The women in general had &s;hock hair, which they were at great pains to ornament. They had large holes in their ears, that, filled as they were, with mo&s;t beautifully coloured &s;hells made up in clu&s;ters, &s;erved for jewels, and had no bad effect. Their head-dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of wreaths of flowers, decorated with feathers chiefly red; and having, in general, lively piercing black eyes, white teeth, &s;mall features, and round faces, were not a little inviting, had not Chpt. Cook's &s;evere prohibition put a check to the predominant pa&s;&s;ion of our men.</P>
<P>Their dre&s;s, upon the whole, was more decent than that of the men; and few were without neck|laces and bracelets, of which they &s;eemed very fond, and for which our &s;trings of beads were well
<PB N="204" REF="280">
&s;uited. To their necklaces were &s;ometimes &s;een &s;mall human figures of bone, hung pendant.</P>
<P>Their language differed but little from that of every other people we had lately vi&s;ited; and we &s;oon learnt to conver&s;e, &s;o as to make our&s;elves under&s;tood.</P>
<P>Their manufactures the people freely &s;old for nails, hatchets, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, knives, or iron in&s;truments of any kind; gla&s;s bowls was a valuable article; &s;o were beads, buttons, looking-gla&s;&s;es, china-cups, and in &s;hort, any of our European com|modities.</P>
<P>Their weapons of war con&s;i&s;ted&mdash;Of &s;pears twelve feet long, curiou&s;ly poli&s;hed, and tapered; about an inch and half in diameter at top, and &s;hod with bearded bone, about a foot in length at the lower end&mdash;Of daggers of a particular make, with which they could &s;tab with both ends&mdash;Of bows and arrows, which &s;eemed rather calculated for diver&s;ion for boys, than for killing enemies; their arrows being a &s;lender reed, only about half a yard long, &s;hod with wood&mdash;Of &s;mall battle-axes, mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly fabricated of &s;tone and wood, and neatly wrought, as were their implements of every kind&mdash;Of &s;aws made of &s;harks teeth, with which they cut up the dead bodies they prepare for meat&mdash;And of &s;lings, with which they threw &s;tones with great force, to a great di&s;tance, but with no certain aim.</P>
<P>Their canoes were long and narrow; not more than two feet wide in the middle, from whence they tapered to both ends. They were &s;trengthened by cro&s;s bars, which &s;erved both for feats and &s;tretchers, and had &s;mall out-riggers, to prevent over-&s;etting.</P>
<P>That they had &s;ome knowledge of iron before we landed among them is certain; but how they
<PB N="205" REF="281">
came by it is not clearly to be accounted for; the mo&s;t probable conjecture is, that it mu&s;t have been drifted to their coa&s;t from &s;ome wrecks; and that opinion is &s;trengthened, by part of an iron hoop being the only precious remains of that metal that was &s;een among them, which was purcha&s;ed by Lieut. King. But from this &s;mall &s;pecimen, how to learn the u&s;e of it, which they certainly did, by their eagerne&s;s to purcha&s;e it? This remains to be accounted for.</P>
<P>Except the &s;ugar-cane, which appeared indi|genous to the&s;e i&s;lands, and which were rare in tho&s;e on the other &s;ide the line, their produce was much the &s;ame with that of the Friendly I&s;les, only the cocoa-nuts were by no means &s;o large, nor in &s;uch great plenty here as at the Friendly I&s;les.</P>
<P>Wood was not to be purcha&s;ed in plenty, nor did we &s;tand much in need of that article.</P>
<P>Hogs, dogs, ducks, and poultry, were here in greater abundance than on the other &s;ide the line; but their plantations were not &s;o beautifully ranged, nor &s;o well cultivated. The hou&s;es here are warmer, as the air is colder. They are built tent-fa&s;hion, and are covered from top to bottom. Their food con&s;i&s;ts of the fruits of the earth, and of animal food, of which there was great plenty, if dogs made a part of it; nor was there any want of fi&s;h, nor of in&s;truments to catch them.</P>
<P>There &s;eems, indeed, a remarkable conformity between the&s;e i&s;lands and tho&s;e of the oppo&s;ite he|mi&s;phere, not only in their &s;ituations, but in their number, and in their manners, cu&s;toms, religious, ceremonies, arts, and manufactures of the inhabi|tants; though it can &s;carce be imagined, that, as the globe is now con&s;tituted, they could ever have any communication, being at more than 2000
<PB N="206" REF="282">
miles di&s;tance one from the other, with very little, if any, dry land between. One cu&s;tom remark|able, they &s;eem to have in common with the New Zealanders; and that is, pulling out one of their teeth.</P>
<P>From ob&s;erving this general conformity among the tropical i&s;landers, &s;ome have been led to be|lieve, that the whole middle region of the earth was once one entire continent; and that what is now the Great South Pacific Ocean, was, in the beginning, the Paradi&s;e of the World: but who|ever would wi&s;h to hear more on this &s;ubject, will do well to read Burnet's Theory of the Earth, where, if they do not find arguments &s;olid enough to convince their rea&s;on, they will meet with rea|&s;ons &s;ufficiently plau&s;ible to amu&s;e their fancy. But we mu&s;t now take leave of the&s;e i&s;lands, tho' we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to mention them again with le&s;s commendation.</P>
<P>Capt. Cook, the &s;hort time he remained at Atooi, vi&s;ited the morais on the i&s;land, which formerly had been mo&s;t magnificent &s;tructures, but were now much in decay, but &s;till pre&s;erved all the appearances of human &s;acrifices; of which there is not a doubt, any more than of their eating the fle&s;h of their enemies, which they call &s;avoury meat.</P>
<P>On the 3d of February, the day after we took our departure, we had heavy &s;qualls, but not &s;o violent as to force us to part company.</P>
<P>On the 4th, it cleared up, and we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e E. N. E. having plea&s;ant weather, and a favouring gale.</P>
<P>On the 5th, our men had pickled pork &s;erved in&s;tead of their ordinary allowance, one pound <HI>per</HI> man a-day, with a pound and a half of yams, in&s;tead of bread; and this was continued to them
<PB N="207" REF="283">
for &s;even weeks, which they liked much better than their &s;hip's provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Nothing material occurred till</P>
<P>The 9th, when there appeared the u&s;ual &s;igns of land, but we &s;aw none, and continued our cour&s;e till</P>
<P>The 13th, when we tacked and &s;tood N. N. W. lat. 30. long. 200. E. But,</P>
<P>On the 14th, we &s;tood again N. by E. with a light breeze. During this interval of fine weather, our &s;ail-makers were employed in getting up and reviewing the &s;ails, when it was found that they were in a mi&s;erable condition, being eaten through by the rats in a hundred places. While they were employed in repairing them, our other artificers had work enough to do; for it was made a point to &s;uffer none to remain idle, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of navigating the &s;hip did not require their immediate attendance. The cour&s;e we were now &s;teering we continued with little or no variation, except what was occa&s;ioned by the &s;hifting of the winds, till the 21&s;t, when in lat. 39. long. 209. E. we &s;hort|tened &s;ail, and &s;teered N. N. W. the whole night, having had &s;trong &s;igns of land to the Ea&s;tward the whole day; but no land coming in &s;ight, we again renewed our cour&s;e, and &s;o continued till</P>
<P>The 26th, when a mo&s;t dreadful &s;torm aro&s;e, with &s;uch a &s;well, that though we were not more than half a mile from the Re&s;olution, we fre|quently lo&s;t &s;ight of her amid&s;t the heavy &s;eas. In this gale, both &s;hips &s;uffered con&s;iderably in their &s;ails and rigging, it being impo&s;&s;ible to hand them before we were &s;urpri&s;ed by the tempe&s;t. We were now in lat. 43.17. and in long. 221.9. and were attended by &s;eals, &s;ea-lions, man-of-war birds, Port Egmont hens, &s;hags, and &s;ea-gulls, which were &s;trong indications of land.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="284">On the morning of the 27th, the wind abated but the &s;well &s;till continued from the Southward and we proceeded under clo&s;e reefed top-&s;ails til about ten in the morning, when we &s;hook out the reefs, and made all the &s;ail we could, in company with the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>March the 1&s;t, the wind died away, and being in lat. 44.49. and long. 228. E. we &s;ounded with 180 fathom, but found no bottom. We now be|gan to feel the effects of an alteration in the cli|mate. From inten&s;e heat, it became piercing cold; and our men, who de&s;pi&s;ed their <HI>Magellan</HI> jackets, while within the temperate climates, now fir&s;t began to find the comfort of them in the&s;e Northern regions.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 2d, &s;ome parts of the &s;ea &s;eemed covered with a kind of &s;lime, and my|riads of &s;mall &s;ea animals were &s;een &s;wimming about, which they did with equal ea&s;e upon their backs, &s;ides, or bellies; and as they varied their po&s;ition with re&s;pect to the light, they emitted the brighte&s;t colours of the mo&s;t precious gems. Sometimes they appeared quite pellucid, at other times a&s;&s;uming various tints of blue, from a pale &s;appharine to a deep violet colour, which were frequently mixed with a ruby or opaline redne&s;s, and glowed with a &s;trength &s;ufficient to illuminate the ve&s;&s;el and water; the&s;e colours appeared mo&s;t vivid, when the gla&s;s into which the&s;e animalcula were placed, was held to a &s;trong light, but had only a browni&s;h ca&s;t when the animals had &s;ub|&s;ided to the bottom. With candle-light, the colour was chiefly a beautiful pale green; and in the dark they had a faint appearance of glowing fire. Mr. Ander&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed them a new &s;pecies of animalcula, which have a &s;hare in producing that
<PB N="209" REF="285">
lucid appearance often ob&s;erved near &s;hips at &s;ea in the night.</P>
<P>On the 5th, being moderate weather, we &s;ounded, and at 56 fathoms found bottom, loamy &s;and and &s;hells. At &s;ix in the evening, we &s;hort|ened &s;ail, and &s;tood all night S. one half W. with the water as white as milk.</P>
<P>On the 6th, both &s;hips wore and &s;tood N. by E. &s;hortening &s;ail in the evening, and &s;tanding all night to the Southward.</P>
<P>On the 7th, we made the land. Cape Blanco, the We&s;ternmo&s;t known point of California, bear|ing E. N. E. then di&s;tant about 8 or 9 leagues. It appeared mountainous, and covered with &s;now. This day the gentlemen in the gun-room dined on a frica&s;&s;ee of rats, which they accounted a veni&s;on fea&s;t; and it was a high treat to the &s;ai|lors, whenever they could be lucky enough to catch a number &s;ufficient to make a meal.</P>
<P>On the 8th, we wore &s;hip, and &s;tood N. E. by E. lat. 44.23. long. 233.5. E. We had heavy &s;qualls, with &s;now and rain. We continued working off land, making little or no way to wind|ward. In the evening, we clo&s;e reefed our top-&s;ails, and within half an hour could not &s;hew an inch of &s;ail, except fore and mizen &s;tay-&s;ails. The &s;torm continued all night, and part of the next day, without the lea&s;t abatement.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 9th, &s;aw the Re&s;o|lution to windward, and at eight came in &s;ight of Cape Blanco, bearing N. by W. di&s;tant about three leagues. At ten tacked &s;hip, and &s;tood off land, both &s;hips in company, lat. 43.10. long. 232.4. E.</P>
<P>On the 10th, both &s;hips &s;tood again for the land, which we could &s;ee at a great di&s;tance. At &s;ix in the evening, the land being di&s;tant about a

league, we wore &s;hip, and &s;tood off all night, Lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olution, lat. 43.41. long. 232.50.</P>
<P>On the 11th, &s;he an&s;wered our &s;ignals, and we were &s;oon in company; but the &s;ea running mountains high, and the wind increa&s;ing a &s;trong gale, we &s;tood N. by E. the wind at E. by N. and about two in the afternoon, the Cape bore N. E. by E. di&s;tant about &s;ix leagues. Here the wind being &s;omewhat abated, and the &s;ea having changed its colour, we &s;ounded at 160 fathom, but no bottom. Both &s;hips &s;tood again W. S.

<P>On the 12th, light winds, which continued all the morning with &s;now and &s;leet. At two in the afternoon, both &s;hips &s;tood S. by W. with a &s;tiff breeze.

<P>On the 14th, at &s;ix in the morning, wore &s;hip, and &s;tood N. by E. wind N. W. by W. Strong gale, with &s;now and rain. About three in the af|ternoon, the wind abated. Stood for the land, then di&s;tant 6 or 7 leagues, bearing N. E. by E. lat. 43.9. long. 231.55.</P>
<P>On the 15th, wore &s;hip, and &s;tood N. half W. the wind E. N. E. all the morning. In the after|noon, heavy &s;qualls, with rain. About four, &s;plit the main top-&s;ail. At &s;ix, clo&s;e reefed the top-&s;ails, and &s;tood all night N. N. E. with heavy

<P>On the 16th, it cleared up, and the wind being moderate, we made &s;ail N. &frac12; E. the wind at W. S. W. At ten in the morning, finding the water to change colour, we &s;ounded at 17 fathom, and looking a-head, &s;aw a large reef, not above two cables length before us. We fired a gun as &s;ignal to the Re&s;olution, and had ju&s;t time and room to e&s;cape the danger. Had it been night, in two minutes we mu&s;t all have peri&s;hed. We tacked, and &s;tood to the Southward till the morning of</P>
<P>The 17th, when we came in &s;ight of land, bearing N. E. by E. di&s;tance eight or nine leagues, high, and whited over with &s;now. The weather was this day &s;o altered, that the gentlemen who delighted in the &s;port, diverted them&s;elves in the boats with &s;hooting ducks, &s;hags, &s;ea-larks, and gulls; and next morning,</P>
<P>The 18th, we continued to &s;teer along &s;hore, the land not more than three miles di&s;tant; &s;aw no inhabitants, but very large trees, and bleak mountains covered with &s;now. About twelve at noon we hauled upon a wind, and &s;tood W. by N. wind S. W. by S. As we found the coa&s;t rugged with high rocks above water, we &s;u&s;pected other rocks below. We therefore kept at a con|venient di&s;tance from the land, and opened upon &s;everal fine inlets and clo&s;e harbours, but no en|trance for &s;hips of burden. Lat. 44.49. long. 231.50.</P>
<P>On the 19th, made &s;ail early in the morning, and &s;tood N. N. E. coa&s;ting it along &s;hore, the

land high and mountainous. We heard howlings of wild bea&s;ts, but &s;aw none. The &s;hores were covered with &s;ea-fowl, and the &s;kirts of the woods with land birds of various kinds.</P>
<P>On the 20th, the weather &s;till continuing fine, we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e N. N. E. with light winds from the S. E. till two in the afternoon, when the clouds began to darken, and the rain pour down in torrents. At five it blew a &s;tiff gale, and at night a fog aro&s;e, when we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olution. At ten it blew a hurricane. We clo&s;e reefed our top-&s;ails, lowered our top-gallant yards, and &s;tood W. S.

<P>On the 21&s;t, as &s;oon as it was day-light, we &s;aw the Re&s;olution bearing N. N. W. di&s;tant about four miles.

About four in the afternoon, the weather altered, and a heavy &s;now came on, which &s;oon filled the decks, the flakes being &s;uch as no man on board had ever &s;een before, and as broad as a &s;mall &s;aucer.

the &s;ails, it &s;plit the jib, carred away the &s;tay, and &s;hivered the main top-ma&s;t &s;tay-&s;ails to frit|ters. As night approached, we furled the cour&s;es and lay too under bare poles.</P>
<P>On the 23d in the morning the wind abated, and the weather cleared up. We made &s;ail to the Southward; but before dark it again began to blow with heavy rain. We &s;tood all night with the &s;hip's head S. one-half W. with &s;tarboard tacks on board. No ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>On the 24th we tacked &s;hip and &s;tood N. N. E. the wind at N. W. by N. a &s;teady breeze; we &s;hook out our reefs and made &s;ail. Such and &s;o variable was the weather on Drake's New Albion coa&s;t. From a hard gale, which increa&s;|ed to a hurricane, not being able to &s;hew an inch of &s;ail for &s;everal hours, the &s;ea running to a tremendous height, the &s;hip rolling till the yard-arms almo&s;t reached the water, it all at once cleared up, moderate and fine gales took place, and &s;o continued the whole day. We were now by ob&s;ervation in lat. 47.25. long. 230.1. As night approached the clouds began to lour, and to threaten another &s;torm: but except &s;ome &s;now and hail which fell in the night, nothing re|markable happened till</P>

<P>On the 26th, at five in the morning, we had a heavy fall of &s;now, which la&s;ted four hours, with piercing winds the whole day. About ten we bore away, and &s;tood N. N. W. the wind at N. E. In the evening we tacked &s;hip and
<PB N="214" REF="290">
&s;tood to the Southward. We were now in lat. 48.28. long. 228.40.</P>
<P>On the 27th, at &s;ix in the morning, &s;tood W. by N. with a &s;tiff breeze. At ten it became very heavy and dark. We &s;tood N. by E. the wind &s;hifted to E. by N. and a calm &s;ucceeded. But about &s;ix in the evening the wind fre&s;hened, and before we could hand the canvas, &s;plit the fore-top-&s;ail.</P>
<P>Early on the 28th, it blowing very hard, we clo&s;e-reefed our top-&s;ails, and &s;tood N. N. E. the wind at E. This day we &s;aw three men of war birds, two Port Egmont hens, &s;everal &s;eals, and &s;ea-lions, with &s;ome whales. Lat. 49.6. long. 228.18.</P>
<P>On the 29th, at two in the morning, it &s;till continued to blow very hard. We tacked, and &s;tood S. S. W. till &s;even in the morning, when the weather cleared up, and the wind rather abated. We &s;hook out our reefs, and made &s;ail N. by E. with a light breeze from E. by N. At ten the man at the ma&s;t-head &s;aw land, bearing from E. S. E. to W. N. W. di&s;tance five or &s;ix leagues. At half after one, P. M. we bore away N. E. by E. for a bay, which we thought we &s;aw to the Ea&s;tward. As we approached it, we ob&s;erved &s;everal &s;mokes and fires a con&s;ider|able way within land. At length, after a &s;eries of the mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous weather that any &s;hips ever experienced for &s;o long a time, we di&s;cover|ed an inlet, the mouth of which was not more than two miles over; in which we entered, and found it a &s;ound, which narrowed as we advan|ced, though it &s;till continued of a con&s;iderable depth. About &s;even in the evening we anchored in ninety-&s;even fathom water, and was pre&s;ently joined by the Re&s;olution. We made &s;igns for
<PB N="215" REF="291">
&s;ome of the natives to come on board; but this they declined, though &s;ome hundreds &s;oon came about the &s;hips, to which they appeared to be no &s;trangers, as they give us to under&s;tand, that iron was what they valued mo&s;t. We ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, that their weapons were headed with copper, and their arrows with iron, which they could obtain only from the Ru&s;&s;ians, or from trade with the Hud&s;on's Bay Company. Though they declined coming on board, they were ne|verthele&s;s very civil; and when they took their leave, &s;aluted us with a war-&s;ong. We were now &s;o far advanced to the Northward and Eastward, as to have reached that void &s;pace in our maps, which is marked as a country unknown.</P>
<P>Early in the morning of the 30th, the boats were armed and manned, and both Captains proceeded to examine the Sound, in order to find a convenient place to refit the &s;hips, which had &s;uffered materially in the violent gales, which for the la&s;t twenty days they had been combating, at the hazard of being hourly da&s;hed to pieces upon the rocks, or &s;tranded upon the &s;hores.</P>
<P>In their progre&s;s they were fortunate enough to di&s;cover a cove, the mo&s;t convenient that could be wi&s;hed; the entrance of which was about two cables length, bounded by high land on each &s;ide, and furni&s;hed with wood and water (now much wanted) &s;o conveniently &s;ituated, that both could be taken on board at le&s;s than a cable's length from the &s;hore; but, though now within the di&s;tance of four miles, it was four o'clock in the evening before we could get the &s;hips properly moored, owing to the uncertainty of the weather, and the violent gu&s;ts to which this coa&s;t is &s;ubject. All this while the Indians behaved peaceably, and apparently with much
<PB N="216" REF="292">
friend&s;hip. They brought, after a &s;hort ac|quaintance, a great variety of valuable &s;kins, &s;uch as beaver, foxes, racoons, &s;quirrels, rein|deer, bears, and &s;everal others, with which we were but little acquainted; but what they chiefly de&s;ired in exchange, were cutlery wares of all &s;orts, edge-tools, copper, pewter, iron, bra&s;s, or any kind of metal, with the u&s;e of which they were not unacquainted. All our people were now employed in the nece&s;&s;ary repairs of the &s;hips, and in cutting wood and getting water on board, while the gentlemen diverted them&s;elves in &s;hoot|ing and botanizing.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of April, about four in the even|ing, there entered the cove a large canoe, in which were thirty armed Indians, who, on their fir&s;t appearance, began a war-&s;ong, and when they had fini&s;hed, took to their paddles, and rowed round the &s;hips, having fir&s;t &s;tript them|&s;elves of their clothing, except one man, who &s;tood upright in the ve&s;&s;el, delivering an oration, of which not a man on board could under&s;tand a word. They paddled round the &s;hips &s;everal times, as if led by curio&s;ity; but did not offer to mole&s;t any of the workmen, nor did they offer to trade. But all hands being in&s;tantly ordered un|der arms, the&s;e new vi&s;itors were &s;een to clothe them&s;elves as before, and to make towards the &s;hips. The Orator made not the lea&s;t he&s;itation, but mounted the &s;hip's &s;ide, and acco&s;ted the Captain with much civility, and after receiving &s;ome pre&s;ents, and &s;topping a little while to ob|&s;erve the artificers, he took a very polite leave, de&s;cended to his boat, and was landed on the op|posite &s;hore of the Sound.</P>
<P>On the 3d, a large body of Indians were &s;een paddling along the Sound, mo&s;tly armed with
<PB N="217" REF="293">
&s;pears from 20 to 30 feet long, and with bows and arrows very neatly made. On their nearer approach they too were heard to tune up their war-&s;ong, and to brandi&s;h their weapons, as if in defiance of an enemy. Their number was alarming; there being not le&s;s than between 3 and 400 of them in their war canoes, who we ap|prehended were come to attack us; but we after|wards under&s;tood they were come to attack a bo|dy of their enemies on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, whom they afterwards engaged, and returned victorious. We were frequently vi&s;ited by &s;uch parties, who appeared always in arms, but never offered the lea&s;t violence. They brought, be&s;ides &s;kins, great quantities of fi&s;h, with plenty of game, which we purcha&s;ed of them for gla&s;s bowls, looking-gla&s;&s;es, nails, hatchets, or whatever uten|&s;ils or toys were either u&s;eful or ornamental.</P>
<P>The men were of an athletic make, very rough to appearance, but more civilized than from their a&s;pect there was rea&s;on to expect. To iron they gave the name of te-tum-min&eacute;, and to other me|tals ch&eacute;-&agrave;-pot&eacute;.</P>
<P>On the 5th, the water, which was excellent, was &s;o conveniently &s;ituated, that by erecting a &s;tage, and con&s;tructing a &s;pout, we could convey it in ca&s;ks into the &s;hips without farther trou|ble. This facilitated the labour of the waterers, and &s;hortened our &s;tay, as wood was conveyed on board with very little more trouble.</P>
<P>On the 6th it blew a &s;torm, and the tide came rolling in at an alarming rate; it pre&s;ently ro&s;e eight or nine feet higher than u&s;ual, and drifted &s;everal of our materials from the &s;hore, which we never could recover; and at nine in the morn|ing the Di&s;covery drifted very near the Re&s;olu|tion, and very narrowly e&s;caped being bulged.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="294">On the 7th, the artificers again re&s;umed their labour. The natives continued their vi&s;its, and be&s;ides fi&s;h, furs, and veni&s;on, brought bladders of oil, which were greedily purcha&s;ed by the men. With this they made &s;auce for their &s;alt-fi&s;h, and no butter in England was ever thought half &s;o good.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here, which was but very &s;hort, owing to the time lo&s;t in making the land, and the advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, no people could be more obliging; they were ready to accompany the gentlemen, who delighted in &s;hooting, in their excur&s;ions, and to &s;hew them the different de|vices they made u&s;e of to catch and to kill their game; they &s;old them their ma&s;ks, their calls, and their gins, and made no &s;ecret of their me|thods of curing the &s;kins, with which they carried on a traffic with occa&s;ional vi&s;itors; in &s;hort, a more open and communicative people does not live under the &s;un. They have, be&s;ides &s;ea-fowl in abundance, &s;wans, eagles, and a variety of o|ther land-fowl, of which we had never &s;een the &s;pecies. Nor were their fi&s;hermen more re&s;erved than their hunters; they pointed out the haunts of the different &s;orts of fi&s;h, and they were not aver&s;e to helping their new acquaintance to com|pleat their lading, whenever they had been un&s;uc|ce&s;sful in filling their boats.</P>
<P>They had not hitherto di&s;covered any di&s;po&s;i|tion to pilfer; but on the 10th day, after our arrival, &s;everal of them being on board, and our people having no &s;u&s;picion of their hone&s;ty, one of them watched his opportunity to &s;lip into the great cabin, and carry off the Captain's watch; which being &s;oon mi&s;&s;ed, all the Indians on board were &s;eized, their boats &s;ecured and &s;earched; and at length it was found hid in a box on board
<PB N="219" REF="295">
one of their canoes, which the offender delivered up without the lea&s;t concern. This watch, had the thief been permitted to carry it off, would pro|bably have been parted with to the fir&s;t &s;ailor he had met with for a &s;ingle nail. About the &s;ame time another Indian made free with a bolt from the armourer's forge; but was &s;een in the fact, and an endeavour made to wre&s;t it from him; but he in&s;tantly jumped over-board, and gave it to one of his companions, who was making off with it, till fired at with &s;mall &s;hot, which brought him back; and he &s;urrendered it, but with &s;uch a fiercene&s;s expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance, as &s;uffi|ciently indicated his intent. In a moment, every Indian in the cove di&s;appeared, and in le&s;s than three hours more than 900 of them a&s;&s;embled in the Sound, and being unclothed, (which is their cu&s;tom when they mean to engage) began their war-&s;ong, and approached the &s;hips. We were in readine&s;s to give them a warm reception; but &s;eeing our preparations, and perhaps not liking our countenance, they all laid down their arms, and putting on their clothes, came peaceably round the &s;hip, without offering the lea&s;t incivility.</P>
<P>Being in great want of ma&s;ts, mo&s;t of tho&s;e we brought out with us being &s;prung, our car|penters were &s;ent into the woods to cut down &s;uch trees as they &s;hould find fit for their pur|po&s;e. This they did without the lea&s;t interrup|tion from any of the inhabitants. They found trees from 100 to 150 feet high, without a knot, and mea&s;uring from 40 to 60 feet in circumfe|rence. In the&s;e trees the eagles build their ne&s;ts. When they had cut down what be&s;t &s;uited their purpo&s;e, the great difficulty was to bring them to the &s;hips; and in this labour they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the natives. It was now their &s;pring, and
<PB N="220" REF="296">
the weather began to change for the better. When we fir&s;t arrived the thermometer was as low as 38&frac12;, and now</P>
<P>This 20th day of April it is as high as 62 de|grees. We have at pre&s;ent the full range of the woods, the &s;now all melted away, and the rivers open. We found plenty of game, and catched fi&s;h in abundance.</P>
<P>April 22. This morning we were vi&s;ited by a large body of Indians, who had come from a great di&s;tance with furs, and other articles of trade. The&s;e were warmly clothed with cloaks of valuable furs, that reached down to their ancles; and among them was a &s;tately youth, to whom the re&s;t paid great re&s;pect. Him our Captain invited on board, which he at fir&s;t de|clined; but after &s;hewing him &s;ome axes, gla&s;s bowls, looking-gla&s;&s;es, and other articles that excited his curio&s;ity, he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be handed into the &s;hip, where he &s;taid &s;ome time, admiring every thing he &s;aw. While the&s;e con|tinued to trade, it was remarked, that no other Indians came in &s;ight; but they had hardly left the &s;hip, when another body of Indians appeared, more than double the number of the former, who hemmed them all into the cove, and &s;tript them of every thing they had about them, and then came and traded with us.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time a chief, who had attached him|&s;elf to Capt. Cook, came on board to take his leave, and received a pre&s;ent, for which in return he pre&s;ented a beaver-&s;kin of much greater value. This called upon the Captain to make a con&s;i|derable addition to his pre&s;ent, with which the chief was &s;o plea&s;ed, that he pulled off his beaver-&s;kin cloak, and laid it at his feet. Struck with this in&s;tance of genero&s;ity, the Captain fetched him a
<PB N="221" REF="297">
new broad &s;word with a bra&s;s-hilt, which made this chief compleatly happy.</P>
<P>On the 26th, having fini&s;hed the repairs of the &s;hips, we began to prepare for our departure; the tents were ordered to be brought on board, the a&s;tronomers ob&s;ervatory, and what live-&s;tock we had yet left; and as the la&s;t &s;ervice to be per|formed, we cut gra&s;s for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, which we were fortunate enough to find in plenty, and to have a pretty good time to make it into hay. We al&s;o, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Nel&s;on, who&s;e bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as has already been ob&s;erved, was to collect the vegetable and other curious productions of the countries through which we pa&s;&s;ed, were en|abled to &s;tock our&s;elves with a large proportion of culinary plants, which was of infinite &s;ervice to us in our more northerly progre&s;s. And now having all things in readine&s;s we began to tow out of the cove into the Sound, to which Capt. Cook gave the name of King George's Sound, and with a light breeze and clear weather to pro|ceed on our voyage: but we had &s;carce reached the Sound, when a violent gu&s;t from E. S. E. threw us into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. All our boats were out, our decks full of lumber, and night com|ing on dark and foggy, our danger was equal to any we had hitherto met with in the cour&s;e of the voyage; though an e&s;pecial Providence &s;eemed to attend us, and to interpo&s;e in our favour: for by this &s;torm a leak was di&s;covered in the Re&s;o|lution, which, had it been calm weather, would probably have proved fatal to the crew. Hav|ing cleared the Sound, we &s;haped our cour&s;e to the We&s;tward, and &s;o continued till day-light, when, &s;eeing nothing of the Re&s;olution, we &s;hortened &s;ail; and before noon &s;he came in &s;ight, &s;eemingly in di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;torm continuing,
<PB N="222" REF="298">
we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e to the North-we&s;tward, till</P>
<P>May 1&s;t, when the weather became fair, and we proceeded with a plea&s;ant breeze. Being now at lei&s;ure to recollect what ob&s;ervations oc|curred at the harbour we have ju&s;t left, the cu|rious reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed with a &s;hort relation. When we fir&s;t arrived in the Sound, the rough countenance of the men &s;eemed to promi&s;e no very agreeable entertainment during our &s;tay; but when they &s;aw our di&s;tre&s;s, and that we only meant to repair our &s;hips, &s;o far from giving us any di&s;turbance, they gave us every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power. They &s;upplied us regularly with fi&s;h; and, when they found that our men liked their oil, they brought it in bladders, and exchanged it for whatever they were plea&s;ed to give in return. They di&s;covered no propen&s;ity to thieve, till they found we were preparing to depart, and then they were &s;o co|vetous of our goods, that they could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation, when a fair opportunity offered, to carry off whatever fell in their way.</P>
<P>The cove, in which we anchored, we found to lie in 49 deg. 33 min. N. and in 233 deg. 16 min. E. but whether the Ruffian di&s;cove|ries had reached &s;o far, we could not be able to determine: that the inhabitants were no &s;tran|gers to the u&s;e of iron and other metals was, as has already been ob&s;erved, vi&s;ible on our fir&s;t ap|proach; but by their manner of u&s;ing what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it was not ea&s;y to di&s;cover from what quarter it came. In the &s;ituation we were in, we did not think it &s;afe to venture far into the coun|try, having no &s;pare hands to attend us. Of their hou&s;es we &s;aw but few; and of their manner of living we know but little. That they eat the

fle&s;h of their enemies, we had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e, by ob&s;erving a human head in one of their canoes, and arms and limbs in another; but that fi&s;h, and the fle&s;h of the animals they catch in hunting, are the principal part of their food, is not to be doubted. Their bread is made from the roes of fi&s;h, but in what manner they prepare it, we could not learn; their &s;auces chiefly &s;ea-blub|ber or oil. We &s;aw none of their hou&s;es near the &s;hore, by which it &s;hould &s;eem that their win|ters are &s;evere, and that they chu&s;e the rece&s;&s;es of the woods, for &s;helter as well as &s;afety. The few hou&s;es we &s;aw were all built of wood, and hung round with dried fi&s;h, and &s;kins of various animals. They have different ma&s;ks for different purpo&s;es; &s;ome they put on when they go to war, which are really frightful; &s;ome that cover their whole bodies, and give them the appearance of the animals they are in pur&s;uit of, who&s;e cries, while, they are young, they are taught to imitate; they have decoys excellently adapted for entrap|ping both fi&s;h and fowl; and they have &s;nares likewi&s;e for &s;naring wild bea&s;ts, and contrivances for killing and curing them as &s;oon as they are catched.</P>
<P>We &s;aw no plantations which exhibited the lea&s;t trace of knowledge in the cultivation of the earth; all &s;eemed to remain in a pure &s;tate of na|ture; &s;hrubs there were in the woods that put forth blo&s;&s;oms, and trees that promi&s;ed in time to bring forth fruit; but except &s;ome currant bu&s;hes, wild ra&s;berries and junipers, we &s;aw none bearing fruit that were known to any but Mr. Nel&s;on.</P>
<P>The men were not ill made, but they disfigured them&s;elves with grea&s;e and coar&s;e paint; they were of a dark copper-colour, with lank black
<PB N="224" REF="301">
hair, which they tied in a knot behind; but they &s;o bepowdered, or rather befeathered it with down, that the colour was hardly di&s;cernible: their clothing was a cloak made of &s;kins of bea&s;ts, which covered them from the neck to their knees, and gave them a &s;avage appearance; &s;ome of them wore high fur caps, but the Chiefs among them had their heads dre&s;&s;ed in a more becoming manner. In that con&s;i&s;ted their chief di&s;tinction. Their heads were bound round with fillets, deco|rated with feathers, which adds &s;o &s;triking a grace to the human figure, that almo&s;t every nation in the known world have agreed in making plumes of feathers a part of their warriors uniform. Their weapons of war were &s;pears from 20 to 30 feet long; their bows about three feet and a half; their arrows two feet, pointed with bone or flint, &s;ome few with iron; but they had one horrid weapon peculiar to them&s;elves, re&s;embling a man's head with hair; it had eyes and no&s;e, but where the mouth &s;hould be, a &s;harp piece of bone or flint about &s;ix inches long was firmly morti&s;ed and ce|mented; in the neck part was a hole, through which they pa&s;&s;ed a &s;trong cord, and fa&s;tened it to the right arm; this we &s;aw none of the warriors without; many of them had be&s;ides, a knife about twelve inches long, of which they were very choice. We &s;aw no mu&s;ical in&s;truments among them; but &s;ome had mu&s;ical voices, and &s;eemed fond of dancing and tumbling in a beari&s;h way. Their canoes were of an uncommon length, many of them from 30 to 40 yards long, made of the main body of one of their enormous trees, of which we have already &s;poken; their breadth from four to five feet over in the middle, and gradually narrowing, like all others, to both ends, but the &s;tem much higher than the &s;tern. They were
<PB N="225" REF="302">
&s;trengthened by bars of wood, or &s;tretchers, placed acro&s;s at certain di&s;tances, and were rowed by paddles about &s;ix feet long, &s;welling from the middle, but &s;harp at the lower ends. Some of tho&s;e canoes were roughly carved and painted with the figures of the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, probably the objects of their wor&s;hip; but what was remark|able, they had no out-riggers to prevent their over&s;etting, like tho&s;e of the &s;outhern i&s;les.</P>
<P>The women are much more delicate than the men, and dre&s;s in cloaks curiou&s;ly woven with the hair of wild bea&s;ts, intermixed with the mo&s;t beautiful furs. We &s;aw but few of them during our &s;tay, and tho&s;e who came in &s;ight were rather in years; they were, however, much fairer than the men; and even fairer than many of the men we had on board. Their employment &s;eems chiefly confined at home. We &s;aw none of them employed in fi&s;hing, nor did we meet any of them in the woods. Be&s;ides the care of their children, and the manufacturing and making the clothing, they may probably a&s;&s;i&s;t in curing and preparing the &s;kins, with which the&s;e people certainly carry on a traffic with &s;trangers; though of that trade, for want of under&s;tanding their language, we could not &s;ufficiently inform our&s;elves. Be that as it may, when we left the harbour, we had more than 300 beaver &s;kins on board, be&s;ides other le&s;s valuable &s;kins, of foxes, racoons, wolves, bears, deer, and &s;everal other wild animals; for dogs excepted, we &s;aw no other dome&s;tic creatures about them.</P>
<P>On May the 1&s;t, in the morning, the weather being fine, we &s;poke with the Re&s;olution, who informed us of the danger they were in of foun|dering in the late gale, by a leak, which increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t upon them, that it baffled the utmo&s;t ef|forts
<PB N="226" REF="303">
of all the hands they had on board; gaining upon them con&s;iderably, though every man in the &s;hip, even to the Captain, took it in turn to work at the pumps; but what was a&s;toni&s;hing, it had now &s;topt of it&s;elf, without the carpenter's being able to di&s;cover either the cau&s;e or the cure. However, Capt. Cook gave us to under&s;tand, that he intended to put in at the fir&s;t harbour he &s;hould fall in with.</P>
<P>We were now in high &s;pirits, not dreaming of the hard&s;hips we had yet to &s;uffer, and we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e at a great rate. Before night we were in lat. 54.44. N. and in long. 224.44. E. with whole flocks of &s;ea-fowl flying over our heads; among which were &s;trings of gee&s;e and &s;wans, all flying to the &s;outhward. We had other indications of land, and on</P>
<P>The 2d we came in &s;ight of a high mountain, being then in lat. 57.3. and in long. 224.7. E. This mountain Capt. Cook named <HI>Mount Edgecomb.</HI></P>
<P>On the 3d, at half an hour after four in the morning, Mount Edgecomb, bore S. 54. E. a large inlet N. 50. E. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues; and the mo&s;t advanced point of the land to the N. W. lying under a very high peeked mountain, which obtained the name of <HI>Mount Fair Weather,</HI> bore N. 52. W. This inlet was called <HI>Cro&s;s Sound,</HI> as being fir&s;t &s;een on that day, &s;o marked in our ca|lendar. At noon the lat. was 58.22. and the long. 220.55. We continued our cour&s;e to the north-we&s;tward as the land trended, till the 10th, when we opened on a very high i&s;land, to which Capt. Cook gave the name of <HI>Kaye I&s;land,</HI> in ho|nour of his friend the Rev. Dr. Kaye, Sub|almoner to his Maje&s;ty. A point &s;hoots out from the main towards this i&s;land, to which the Captain
<PB N="227" REF="304">
gave the name of <HI>Cape Suckling.</HI> This i&s;land, on examination, was found barren, and de&s;titute of inhabitants. This we left to the &s;outhward, and continued our cour&s;e, in hopes of di&s;covering &s;ome harbour where the Re&s;olution might exa|mine her leaks. We were now in lat. 59.51. and in long. 215.56. the land high and mountainous, and covered with &s;now. At four in the afternoon, we came in &s;ight of Cape Elias, a va&s;t promontory, that &s;eemed to cover its head in the clouds. It bore from us S. &frac12; W.</P>
<P>On the 11th we had a fla&s;k calm, which la&s;ted for the &s;pace of four hours, during which all hands were employed, officers as well as men, in fi&s;hing, &s;hooting, or cha&s;ing the &s;eals, and &s;ea-lions that played about the &s;hips. Great quantities of fine cod were caught, which furni&s;hed a high treat to both &s;hips companies; and &s;ome docks, &s;ea-larks, and four &s;ea-parrots, were killed by the fowlers. In the evening a fre&s;h breeze &s;prang up, and we coa&s;ted along &s;hore, but &s;aw no inhabitants, though many fires were ob&s;erved in the night within land. In our cour&s;e we pa&s;&s;ed a bay, named by Capt. Cook Comptrollers Bay. Lat. 60.15. long. 215.15.</P>
<P>On the 12th we hauled up to double a cape, to which our Commodore gave the name of Cape Hinchinbroke, and &s;aw the land trending very much to the northward. About 3, A. M. we tacked, &s;teering N. N. W. and at nine in the morning, opened a large &s;trait, the entrance of which appeared to be about four miles. About four in the afternoon we entered the mouth of the &s;trait, and met a &s;trong current that &s;et to the &s;outhward to oppo&s;e our progre&s;s; having a &s;tiff breeze, and the wind much in our favour, we with difficulty &s;temmed the tide, and before &s;ix in the evening, the Re&s;olution opened a clo&s;e harbour
<PB N="228" REF="305">
or bay, that trended to the ea&s;tward, round a bluff point of high land, and was &s;oon followed by the Di&s;covery. Here both &s;hips ca&s;t anchor clo&s;e under the lee of the land, which we had &s;carce ac|compli&s;hed, before the boats were ordered out, and &s;ome, eager to haul the &s;eine, and others to go a &s;hooting, were impatient to begin, when un|expectedly they were alarmed by four canoes, in which were between 20 and 30 Indians not more than two miles di&s;tant, and rowing with all their might towards the boats, who not being prepared for &s;uch an attack, made the be&s;t of their way back to the &s;hips. As the Indians neared the boats, they began their war-&s;ong, as their cu&s;tom is, and brandi&s;hing their arms, denounced defiance; but by this time other boats armed from the &s;hips, had joined the &s;port&s;men, who were now &s;o near the &s;hips as to be out of danger. The Indians had then time to cool; they retreated to the op|po&s;ite &s;ide of the harbour, and in a very little time returned, with a white cloak di&s;played as a &s;ignal of peace, which was an&s;wered by a white flag; and then they came on board without the lea&s;t ce|remony. Their features, &s;ize and colour differed little from tho&s;e we had ju&s;t left in George's Sound; but they had a &s;lit between their lower lip and chin, through which they could put their tongue, that gave them the appearance of having a double mouth. Add to this, the ornaments they wore in their no&s;es and ears, of tin and copper, and no figures upon earth could be more gro|te&s;que. However, they behaved civilly, and it being near night they took their leave, promi&s;ing to vi&s;it us again in the morning; which they ac|cordingly did, bringing with them the very &s;ame forts of &s;kins which we had purcha&s;ed of the In|dians at our former harbour, and which they rea|dily
<PB N="229" REF="306">
parted with for any thing made of iron, though they were rather choice. The&s;e were clothed with the &s;kins of birds neatly &s;ewed together, and they had be&s;ides a covering madelike parchment, which in rainy or &s;nowy weather was water proof, &s;o that no wet could affect them. Their ordinary canoes too had coverings of the &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>They had &s;ome in&s;truments for fi&s;hing, which we did not ob&s;erve among the more &s;outherly Indians; &s;uch as harpoons, and gigs, all of which they were very ready to part with, as well as their clothing, of which, though valuable to us, they made but little account. The&s;e were chiefly pur|cha&s;ed by the &s;ailors for gla&s;s beads, who found them warmer, and better adapted to the climate than any of their other clothing. They had &s;pears al&s;o, and lances headed with iron, very neatly ma|nufactured, and knives, which they kept as bright as &s;ilver; but the&s;e they refu&s;ed to exchange for any thing we offered.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 13th, we weighed, and pur&s;ued our cour&s;e to the northward up the &s;trait all day, with the plea&s;ing hope of having found the pa&s;&s;age of which we were in &s;earch. In our way we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal very fine rivers that emptied their waters into that which we were now explor|ing. About four in the afternoon, we came to an anchor in 18 fathom water, and were &s;urrounded with Indians who came to plunder; but finding us on our guard, they &s;neaked off without their booty. Here, being &s;afely moored ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to a &s;mall rivulet of excellent water, the boats were ordered out to fill the empty ca&s;ks, and the car|penters from both &s;hips were &s;et to work to find out the leak in the Re&s;olution; and after a mo&s;t painful &s;earch, a hole was di&s;covered in the &s;hip's &s;ide, eaten quite through by the rats; which, by
<PB N="230" REF="307">
the working of the &s;hip in the &s;torm, had provi|dentially filled with rubbi&s;h, and thereby pre|vented her foundering. So &s;aid our Journali&s;t, but Capt. Cook ob&s;erves, that the &s;eams were open, both in and under the wale; and in &s;eve|ral places not a bit of oakum in them.</P>
<P>On the 14th, while we were employed on this nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice, we were vi&s;ited by crowds of In|dians, per&s;uading us to proceed; but our pinnace being ordered out, with boats to attend her, in order to examine the &s;trait, it was found to be only an inlet, through which there was no pa&s;&s;age for &s;hips or other ve&s;&s;els to any con&s;iderable di&s;tance. Lat. 60.53.</P>
<P>To our great di&s;appointment, therefore, after continuing here eight days, during which time every part of the &s;ound had been examined, and the country for &s;everal miles round reconnoitred, we took leave of this &s;ound (to which Capt. Cook gave the name of Prince William's Sound) to the great joy of the &s;hips companies, who with work|ing the &s;hips up one day and down another, as wind and tide &s;erved, were almo&s;t worn down with hard labour, though none were &s;ick; nor did any accident happen to any, except to William Au&s;tin, who unfortunately had his leg broke by lifting an anchor out of the boat to launch it overboard, and being entangled in the buoy-rope, went down with it in 22 fathom water, but came up again without any hurt, and was afterwards, by the care of the Surgeon, perfectly cured.</P>
<P>On the 16th, when the weather, which had been foggy, cleared up, we found our&s;elves &s;ur|rounded by land on every &s;ide, and &s;heltered in a nook, called <HI>Snug Corner Bay,</HI> and a &s;nug corner it certainly was.</P>
<P>On the 17th, Mr. Gore, from the Re&s;olution, was &s;ent to examine the northern arm of the inlet,

and Mr. Bligh, the ma&s;ter, to take an ea&s;terly di|rection; this la&s;t found the arm, he went to exa|mine, to terminate in a group of i&s;lands; Mr. Gore reported that his arm was open, and probably a pa&s;&s;age might be found; but Mr. Roberts, who accompanied him, was of opinion, that he &s;aw the end of the inlet; this to Capt. Cook rendered the pa&s;&s;age very doubtful; and being willing to pur|&s;ue his voyage to the North while the &s;ea&s;on was yet favourable, he re&s;olved to wa&s;te no more time in a fruitle&s;s &s;earch.</P>
<P>On the 20th, having the weather fine and the wind fair, we returned to &s;ea, not by the &s;ame channel, but by one more to the we&s;tward than that by which we entered. It was &s;eparated from the other by an i&s;land, extending 18 leagues, in the direction of North-ea&s;t and South-we&s;t, to which the Commodore gave the name of Mon|tague I&s;land; and the intermediate i&s;lands, becau&s;e of their verdures, he called Green I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Early on the 21&s;t a &s;torm came on, which ob|liged us to lay to with the &s;hip's head to the ea&s;tward; but in the afternoon it abated, and about five we came up with the &s;outhernmo&s;t promontory [Cape Elizabeth] which we had &s;een the day before, and opened on a fine bay, which trended full to the we&s;tward, with very high land on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 22d we tacked, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, and &s;till &s;aw the land trend very much to the &s;outhward. Lat. 59.7. long. 208.26.</P>
<P>On the 23d, the weather being clear and plea|&s;ant, and there being little or no wind, the boats were ordered out, and all hands were employed in fi&s;hing, except the Gentlemen, who preferred the diver&s;ion of &s;hooting.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="310">On the 24th a &s;tiff breeze &s;prung up, attended with very heavy &s;qualls, with &s;now and rain, in which we carried away our main top-gallant-ma&s;t in the &s;lings, and received other damage in our &s;ails and rigging. This day we pa&s;&s;ed a deal of land to the we&s;tward, which appeared to us like i&s;lands, (among which was that called Cape Her|mogenes,) mo&s;tly very high; we continued &s;teer|ing as the land trended, and examining every bay and inlet as we pa&s;&s;ed along. Lat. 58.26.</P>
<P>On the 25th we altered our cour&s;e, to N. by W. the land trending away to N. E. high and mountainous. At noon we pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome large i&s;lands, bearing from W. S. W. to N. W. and which obtained the name of Barren I&s;les, and &s;oon after came in &s;ight of a lofty promontory, who&s;e ele|vated &s;ummit, forming two exceedingly high mountains, was &s;een above the clouds. To this promontory Capt. Cook gave the name of Cape Douglas, in honour of his good friend Dr. Doug|las, Canon of Wind&s;or.</P>
<P>On the 26th, at 3 A. M. we perceived one continued chain of mountains, to the highe&s;t of which was given the name of Mount St. Augu&s;tine; and &s;aw two very high burning mountains at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. We kept &s;teering to the northward, as we &s;aw no land a-head, by rea&s;on of a great fog; but as &s;oon as the fog cleared up, we found our&s;elves in the entrance of a va&s;t river, &s;uppo&s;ed to be about four miles over, with a &s;trong current &s;etting to the &s;outhward, lat. 59.8.</P>
<P>On the 27th we found the river to widen as we advanced, and the land to flatten. We continued under an ea&s;y &s;ail all day and the following night, &s;ounding as we advanced from 30 to 40 fathom, &s;helly bottom and white &s;and. We were once more flattered with having found the pa&s;&s;age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="233" REF="311">
which we were in pur&s;uit, being now in the lati|tude of 60 degrees north.</P>
<P>On the 28th, in the morning, we &s;ounded at 24 fathom, the tide &s;till &s;etting &s;trong to the &s;outhward at the rate of five and &s;ix knots an hour; but the wind dying away, the &s;ignal was made for ca&s;ting anchor, when both &s;hips came to in 26 fathom water; but the Re&s;olution ex|pecting to come to with her &s;mall &s;tream anchor, let the whole run out, and lo&s;t both anchor and hau&s;er, be&s;ides the &s;hip's grapnel in looking for it. About 8 at night, the &s;ignal was made to weigh and &s;ail; but at ten the current ran &s;o &s;trong, that both &s;hips were again obliged to ca&s;t anchor in 24 fathom, bottom &s;ame as before. It was now light all night, and we could perceive the river to make N. N. W. very rapid. lat. 60.5.</P>
<P>On the 29th we made &s;ail with a fre&s;h wind, and advanced apace, but on trying the water we found a great alteration from &s;alt to fre&s;h. This day we were vi&s;ited by &s;everal Indians, who brought &s;kins of wolves, foxes, &s;quirrels, deer, and &s;ome few beaver, which they exchanged for tri|fles. In the night we ob&s;erved they made large fires; but the flames from the two burning moun|tains &s;eemed to darken their light. We were now clo&s;e under them, and the roaring they made was infinitely more terrifying than the mo&s;t tremen|dous thunder. They are of an immen&s;e height, and ri&s;e in the form of &s;ugar-loaves, and bore N. and S. of each other, and are called by the natives, Ea-neb-kay. We found regular &s;oundings all this day, till opening into a large wide extended bay, the water &s;hallowed, and we ca&s;t anchor in nine fathom water, brown &s;and and &s;hells as before.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="312">On the 30th, the boats were ordered out, and after a fruitle&s;s &s;earch to find a pa&s;&s;age, &s;ounding from two to four fathom, with the water bracki&s;h, they returned in the morning, and were taken on board. In the evening, they renewed their labour, &s;ounding to the north ea&s;tward, as the day before they had &s;ounded in the oppo&s;ite direction.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, the Re&s;olution plyed higher up, and came to an anchor in 16 fathom water, and found the ebb already begun. It ran only three knots an hour, and fell upon a perpendicular 22 feet. Here they &s;aw an opening between the mountains, and were in doubt whether the open|ing did not take an ea&s;terly direction through the above opening; or whether that opening was only a branch of it, and that the main channel con|tinued its northern direction. Next day Mr. Bligh, the ma&s;ter, reported, that he had found the inlet contracted to the breadth of one league by low land, through which it continued its northerly direction; that he proceeded three leagues through this narrow part, which he found navigable for the large&s;t &s;hips; but the water, as it ran down, fre&s;h. He landed on an i&s;land, that, it &s;hould &s;eem, divided this main channel, and a branch that had an ea&s;terly cour&s;e, upon which he found current bu&s;hes, with the fruit already (June) &s;et; and &s;ome other fruit-trees unknown to him. About three leagues beyond this, he ob|&s;erved another &s;eparation in the ea&s;tern chain of mountains, but &s;till thought the main channel pre&s;erved its northern direction. To get a nearer view of the ea&s;tern branch, the Re&s;olution weigh|ed, and plyed up before high water; but the wind being contrary, he was obliged to ca&s;t an|chor, and having di&s;patched two boats to make ob&s;ervations, and examine the tides, they found
<PB N="235" REF="313">
that the flood &s;et &s;trong into the ea&s;tern branch, which Capt. Cook di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>River Turnagain</HI>; and that the ebb came out with &s;till greater force. Being now convinced, that no pa&s;&s;age was to be expected by this river, any more than by the main branch, Capt. Cook gave orders to Mr. King to land on the northern point of the low land, there to di&s;play the flag, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country and river, and to bury in the ground a bottle, containing &s;ome pieces of Engli&s;h coin, of the year 1772, and a paper, on which was in&s;cribed the names of the &s;hips, and the date of the di&s;covery. In the mean time, a party of us, with officers, attended by a &s;erjeant's guard of marines, landed on the ea&s;ternmo&s;t &s;hore, in order to reconnoitre the country. We had pro|ceeded more than four miles without &s;eeing one inhabitant, and were going to &s;cour the woods for game, when a body of Indians, to the number of forty or fifty, ru&s;hed out of an adjoining thicket, all armed after their manner with bows and &s;pears; a few of our marines di&s;charged their pieces over their heads, which in&s;tantly &s;topt their career; and they were retreating as rapidly as they came on, when the officer, who had the command, advancing &s;ingly grounded his piece, and made &s;igns for them to halt. One who &s;eemed to have the command of the re&s;t, turning &s;uddenly about, ob&s;erved his motions, and under&s;tood them; and calling to the re&s;t, they all &s;topt, and, after a &s;hort con&s;ultation, laid down their arms, and &s;tripping them&s;elves quite naked, laid their clothes down by them. This we un|der&s;tood they did, to &s;how that they had no arms concealed. We then advanced, and entered into a kind of dumb di&s;cour&s;e, of which we could under|&s;tand enough to know that they wanted us to ac|company them to their town, which we very
<PB N="236" REF="314">
readily did; they very deliberately put on their clothes, and then &s;hewed us the way.</P>
<P>When we arrived, we found a number of wretched huts, with women and children, old men and dogs, who at fir&s;t &s;ight of us, were more frightened than their ma&s;ters, hanging their tails, and &s;neaking away. One of the&s;e Mr. Law, our Surgeon, purcha&s;ed. The&s;e huts con&s;i&s;ted of nothing but long poles, rudely con&s;tructed into the form of a hovel, and covered over with heathy earth. For a door, they had a hole ju&s;t large enough to creep in at, which, in cold weather, they clo&s;e with a kind of faggot. Their inner apartments were holes or pits dug in the earth, and divided like &s;talls in a &s;table. Their furni|ture we did not take the pains to &s;urvey. We &s;aw &s;ome bladders full of blubber or fat, hanging about, and &s;ome &s;kins of bea&s;ts; al&s;o, dried fi&s;h in plenty. We likewi&s;e &s;aw &s;everal wooden uten|&s;ils, be&s;ides their arms; and we &s;aw quantities of &s;alt in wooden troughs. They had dried fle&s;h, too, probably the remains of their winter provi|&s;ions, which we under&s;tood they eat raw, and &s;ome of which they offered us for dinner. In the&s;e huts, or holes, they burn no fire; but in the winter they &s;hut them&s;elves up clo&s;e, and have lamps, which they continually keep burning: for here, during the winter months, they &s;carce ever &s;ee the &s;un. We were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ight of &s;ome of their children, who were as fair, and their &s;kins as white, as tho&s;e of many children in England; their dark coppery complexion is therefore owing to their anointing and grea&s;ing their children when they are young, and expo&s;ing them to all weathers while they have light, and &s;hutting them in their &s;moaky caverns when it is dark. We found little or no difference between
<PB N="237" REF="315">
the people in this &s;ound and tho&s;e we have de|&s;cribed in the other, except having large drops or ornaments at their ears and no&s;es, of beads of their own making. The&s;e they would not part with. They had gloves and boots likewi&s;e of their own manufacturing, and cloaks very curiou&s;ly wrought. Their hair in general was long and black, which they dre&s;s and decorate with feathers and down. The women wear ornaments of ivory, beads, or tran&s;parent &s;tones, which they hang to their ears, or run acro&s;s their no&s;trils with a needle of bone about an inch and a half long, having another of equal length, which they pa&s;s cro&s;s a fal&s;e mouth ju&s;t above the chin. To the&s;e they &s;tring their ornaments, as in the figure annexed: and in this con&s;i&s;ts their pride. Having gratified our curi|o&s;ity, we returned to our &s;hips; and having no|thing farther to detain us,</P>
<P>On the 2d of June, in the afternoon, we &s;et &s;ail. The &s;ame afternoon, the Re&s;olution &s;truck, and &s;tuck fa&s;t on a bank in the middle of the ri|ver; but on the return of the tide, floated off without any damage. We were now in lat. 61.15. N. and in long. 209.55. E. many leagues within land, and it was not till the 6th that we cleared the channel.</P>
<P>The 4th, being his Maje&s;ty's birth-day we kept as a day of rejoicing.</P>
<P>On the 5th, we pa&s;&s;ed the burning mountains, and the wind dying away, we ca&s;t anchor, and &s;hooting and fi&s;hing now took place of watching and hard labour. While the crews were pur&s;uing their &s;port, two canoes approached the &s;hips, with more than forty &s;trangers, who were differently clothed from tho&s;e Indians we had hitherto &s;een in this latitude. They brought with them curi|o&s;ities of various kinds and &s;hapes; al&s;o great quantities of &s;kins of &s;eals, wolves, deer, black
<PB N="238" REF="316">
and white foxes, racoons, martins, &s;ables, and &s;ome few beavers, which they them&s;elves had compleatly manufactured, and were &s;oon pur|cha&s;ed by tho&s;e on board. The dre&s;s of the&s;e men were &s;kins of birds, with the feathers out|wards, very neatly &s;ewed, and reaching from the neck to the mid-leg. Under the&s;e they had a kind of trow&s;ers, which parted in the middle, and &s;ur|rounded their thighs. Under their feet they had a coar&s;e covering that &s;erved for &s;hoes. All the&s;e, though the weather was cold, they parted with, and mo&s;t of them went naked from the &s;hips, making &s;igns for us to follow them, though it was not ea&s;y to di&s;cover from whence they came, nor where they were to go.</P>
<P>The 6th, a breeze &s;prang up, and we cleared the &s;trait, to the un&s;peakable joy of the &s;ailors, who, during the whole time from our entrance till our return, worked with incredible labour, an|choring and weighing as in the former &s;ound, ju&s;t as the winds and the tide afforded opportunity. During our pa&s;&s;age, we had frequent interviews with the natives, who, the nearer we approached the &s;hore, were, as we have ob&s;erved, better clothed, and &s;hewed &s;ome manufactures of their own, and of other nations; and were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a greater variety of &s;kins than tho&s;e within land, which were &s;trong indications of a foreign trade; but by what conveyance carried on, all our endea|vours at this time could not di&s;cover. This day we pa&s;&s;ed the barren i&s;les.</P>
<P>On the 7th, at noon, St. Hermogenes bore N. four leagues di&s;tant. It appeared green and fer|tile.</P>
<P>On the 8th, we continued this cour&s;e with very little variation, till night, when a thick fog came

on, and we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olution. This weather continued till</P>
<P>The 10th, when the Re&s;olution, in coa&s;ting along the main, ran foul of a dangerous reef, that appeared ju&s;t above water, clo&s;e under her lee|bow. Her good fortune &s;till accompanied her, for &s;he &s;lid off without damage. Lat. 56.44. long. 207.53.</P>
<P>On the 11th, we were alarmed by the cla&s;hing of the waves, as if &s;ome great building was tum|bling in, and looking round the &s;hip, we &s;aw our&s;elves involved among &s;hoals of &s;eals and &s;ea-lions, who pre&s;ently &s;et up the mo&s;t frightful howlings; at the &s;ame time, we ob&s;erved a large whale to pa&s;s along, at which we fired a &s;wivel, but without effect. We this day &s;tood to the North-Ea&s;t as the land trended.</P>
<P>On the 12th, Cape St. Barnabas bore N. 52. E. At eight o'clock, we opened upon &s;ome new land, the extreme Ea&s;tward point of which bore E. S. E. In the evening we &s;tood S.</P>
<P>On the 14th, in the morning, we &s;aw <HI>Trinity I&s;land,</HI> di&s;tant 7 or 8 leagues, lat. 56.23. lon. 205.16. We directed our cour&s;e along &s;hore.</P>
<P>On the 15th, the weather hazy, we lo&s;t &s;ight of land, &s;ounded, and found no ground at 100 fathom. A &s;torm came on, and both &s;hips &s;tood to &s;ea.</P>
<P>On the 16th, it abated, the weather clear, [came in &s;ight of Foggy I&s;land, &s;o called by Beer|ing] &s;tood W. N. W. with a &s;tiff breeze; lat. at noon by ob&s;ervation, 56.24. long. 202.17.</P>
<P>On the 17th, &s;tood in, and &s;aw land trend S. &frac12; E. as far as the eye could carry. At nine in the morning we opened a large bay, the entrance of which from S. W. to N. W. about three miles over; but having a fine breeze in our favour, we
<PB N="240" REF="318">
continued along &s;hore. We were now about two leagues di&s;tant from the &s;hore, which was covered with gee&s;e, ducks, &s;hags, and &s;ea-fowls, innu|merable.</P>
<P>On the 19th, we coa&s;ted along &s;hore, and pa&s;|&s;ed many dangerous rocks and &s;hoals, which we &s;aw project from the main into the &s;ea to a great di&s;tance. We were now in lat. 55.26. long. 200.48. E. At two in the afternoon, we pa&s;&s;ed two large i&s;lands to the Southward of us, and about three had pa&s;&s;ed all the land to the Southward, when, being within half a mile of the main, we ob&s;erved three canoes making towards us, in which were &s;ix Indians. When they came along &s;ide, they made &s;igns for us to drop our anchors, inti|mating that the people on &s;hore would be glad to &s;ee us; at the &s;ame time, we thought we heard the report of a gun. Little notice, however, was taken of what pa&s;&s;ed. The people from the gang-way talked with the men, one of whom made &s;igns for letting down a rope, to which he tied a neat box, curiou&s;ly made up with &s;mall twine, for which he would take nothing in return. The man who took it, looked upon it as a great curio&s;ity; and, after the Indians were gone, began to exa|mine the contents, when a note was found in the in&s;ide, which was immediately carried to the Cap|tain, and a con&s;ultation was held on the quarter-deck to endeavour to decypher the contents; but none on board the Di&s;covery could make out a letter. The &s;hip was then hove-to, three guns fired, and a jack hoi&s;ted to the ma&s;t-head for &s;topping the Re&s;olution. This being ob&s;erved, all on board were &s;truck with fear for the &s;afety of the Di&s;covery, thinking that &s;ome fatal di&s;a&s;ter had happened, and that &s;he was going to the bottom. Their boat was in&s;tantly hoi&s;ted out,
<PB N="241" REF="319">
and Mr. William&s;on, third Lieutenant, came in all ha&s;te to learn the cau&s;e. With him our Cap|tain returned, and related what had happened, and &s;hewed Captain Cook the note, who likewi&s;e held a con&s;ultation upon it, and it was handed from the quarter-deck to the gang-way, where every man in the &s;hip might &s;ee it; but not a man could make out more than &s;omething like the date 1778, of which they were not clear. We therefore con|tinued our cour&s;e along the coa&s;t as the land trend|ed, but &s;aw no opening, nor any inhabitants. About midnight, we &s;aw a va&s;t flame a&s;cend from a burning mountain, and ob&s;erved &s;everal fires within land. Latitude by ob&s;ervation 54.47. N. long. 197.52. E.</P>
<P>On the 20th, early in the morning, looking out a-head, we &s;aw &s;omething like a reef before us, and fired a gun for the Re&s;olution to tack; happy that day-light had enabled us to e&s;cape the danger.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, we &s;teered S. W. but at eight A. M. finding the land to trend more to the Southward, we altered our cour&s;e to S. S. W. the extreme of the land in &s;ight bearing W. by S. &s;even or eight leagues, very high land, and much &s;now. About two in the afternoon, we came again in &s;ight of the two burning mountains, which we had before &s;een, but at a great di&s;tance, bearing N. W. by N. Our cour&s;e during the night was S. S. W. During the cour&s;e of this day, the weather being fair, and but little wind, the men were employed in fi&s;hing; and in le&s;s than four hours caught more than three ton weight of cod and holybut, &s;ome of the latter more than a hundred pounds weight. Here a man in a &s;mall canoe came on board the Re&s;olution. He bowed and pulled off his cap, and &s;hewed evident &s;igns of
<PB N="242" REF="320">
having had commercial dealings with the Ru&s;&s;ians. He wore a pair of green cloth breeches, and a jacket of black cloth. He had nothing to barter, except a grey fox &s;kin.</P>
<P>On the 22d, our men were employed in &s;alting and barreling up, for future u&s;e, what the &s;hip's company could not con&s;ume while fre&s;h, which proved a mo&s;t acceptable &s;upply. All this day we kept our cour&s;e S. W. by S.</P>
<P>On the 23d, in the evening, we &s;haped our cour&s;e more to the We&s;tward, the weather thick and hazy.</P>
<P>On the 24th, little wind and hazy. Saw no land; but looking over the &s;hip's &s;ide, ob&s;erved the water to change to a milky white. Sounded, and found ground at 47 fathom. About four P. M. we &s;aw two very high i&s;lands bearing N. W. di&s;tance about five leagues, and could di&s;cern the main land contiguous. We bore away under the lee of the We&s;ternmo&s;t, and continued &s;teering all night S. by W.</P>
<P>On the 25th, in the morning, we changed our cour&s;e, &s;teering S. W. as the land trended. At ten the &s;ame morning, we had a full view of the land for many miles, but &s;aw no &s;igns of hou&s;es or inhabitants; but doubtle&s;s, though the coun|try appeared rugged and barren, and in many places white with &s;now, there were many people in the inland parts. About &s;even in the evening we could &s;ee land at a great di&s;tance, bearing due South, which had the appearance of a large i&s;land. Hitherto we had been exploring the coa&s;ts of an unknown continent; unknown, at lea&s;t, to our European geographers: though we &s;hall &s;ee by the &s;equel, that it was not wholly unexplored by the A&s;iatic Ru&s;&s;ians. Towards night, though it had been perfectly clear all day, the air began to
<PB N="243" REF="321">
thicken, and by ten at night the fog was &s;o thick that we could not &s;ee the &s;hip's length. We kept firing guns, burning fal&s;e fires, and &s;tanding off land all night, as did the Re&s;olution; and in the morning of the</P>
<P>26th, when the fog di&s;per&s;ed, we found our|&s;elves in a deep bay, &s;urrounded by high lands, and almo&s;t a&s;hore under a high mountain, which we had not before di&s;cerned. Both &s;hips in&s;tantly dropt anchor in 24 fathom water, blue muddy bottom, within two cables length of the &s;hore, and among &s;hoals and breakers, from which we mo&s;t miraculou&s;ly e&s;caped. For &s;ome time we &s;tood in amazement how we could po&s;&s;ibly get into &s;uch a frightful &s;ituation. But being in it, for our own &s;afety we moored both &s;hips; and happy it was we u&s;ed that precaution; for a gale came on, when our whole exi&s;tence depended upon the goodne&s;s of our cables. In the evening, the boats were got out, and the Captain, with &s;everal other gentlemen, went on &s;hore; but with great danger were landed, as were likewi&s;e &s;ome boats from both &s;hips, to cut gra&s;s for the live &s;tock that yet remained. They afterwards found that this was an i&s;land, called by the Ru&s;&s;ians, Vonula&s;hka I&s;land; but &s;aw no inhabitants. In their excur&s;ion the gentlemen &s;hot two eagles and &s;everal other birds of various &s;orts, and &s;oon re|turned on board the &s;hips. Lat. ob&s;. 53.39. Long. 193.16. E.</P>
<P>On the 27th, at three A. M. it cea&s;ed blowing, and the weather began to clear. At &s;ix we un|moored, and &s;ailed under clo&s;e reefed top-&s;ails, directing our cour&s;e N. W. for an opening we &s;aw at about a league di&s;tance; but at nine the wind dying away, we anchored again in 25 fathom water, loamy &s;and. It being a dead calm, our
<PB N="244" REF="322">
boats were ordered out, and &s;ome gentlemen went again on &s;hore, to examine the i&s;land more clo&s;ely. In their &s;earch they found &s;omething like an In|dian man&s;ion, being a deep pit &s;unk in the earth, with &s;ome poles placed acro&s;s it after their manner, and covered with &s;ods, and a hole to creep into it about two feet &s;quare. In it they found the bones of dried fi&s;h, and of birds, and near it a place where there had been a fire, but all had the ap|pearance of being long de&s;erted. They al&s;o found the rib of a whale, about eight feet long, which it was not ea&s;y to account how it could come there. About noon the gentlemen returned on board, and a breeze &s;pringing up from the Ea&s;tward, we weighed, and took leave of this dangerous bay, to which Capt. Cook gave the name of Providence Bay, as it was owing to Pro|vidence that we were here miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved from peri&s;hing. We had plea&s;ant weather all day, and the land high all round us. We &s;ounded all the afternoon from 18 to 36 fathom, mo&s;tly &s;andy bottom. In the evening we &s;aw a large body of Indians towing a whale which they had &s;truck, who were too bu&s;y to mind us till late, when two canoes came along-&s;ide and traded. We were &s;urpri&s;ed when they a&s;ked us for tobacco, and more &s;o when they &s;hewed us &s;ome, together with &s;nuff in their boxes. As tobacco was a precious commodity on board, we could &s;pare them little, but for that little they were thankful, and de|parted. We pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal i&s;lands to the Ea&s;t|ward, very high and mountainous.</P>
<P>On the 28th, in the morning, Mr. Nel&s;on, ac|companied by &s;everal other gentlemen, went on &s;hore botanizing; they found great variety of plants and flowers peculiar to the country, be&s;ides others, with which we were all well acquainted;
<PB N="245" REF="323">
&s;uch as primro&s;es, violets, currants, ra&s;berries, juniper, and many other Northern fruits, which were now all in blo&s;&s;om. They found al&s;o a bird's ne&s;t, with five &s;mall eggs, not unlike a &s;parrow's. After &s;ome &s;tay they came again on board, and the wind dying away, and the Re&s;o|lution having got far a-head, our boats were em|ployed in towing us, when a &s;trong current meet|ing us right a-head, baffled their endeavours. This current ran with &s;uch force, that the Re&s;o|lution, unable to &s;tem it, ca&s;t anchor, and &s;oon after was joined by the Di&s;covery. Here &s;everal canoes came from the land to trade, and made &s;igns for more tobacco, of which our own men were in great want. About noon we opened on a fine harbour to the We&s;tward of us; but we were the whole afternoon in working up the Race, as it was called, from the rapidity of its motion, and the &s;trength with which it &s;et again&s;t us. Our fir&s;t attempt to &s;tem it proved fruitle&s;s. We were driven as far back as the place from whence we &s;et out. On the tide's turning in our favour, we made a &s;econd attempt, and &s;ucceeded. About &s;ix in the evening, we ca&s;t anchor 12 fathom water, and &s;oon after came to moorings. We were, in le&s;s than an hour, &s;urrounded with more than thirty canoes, with rock fi&s;h and dried &s;al|mon, which they exchanged for beads, &s;mall nails, or any thing we offered them. They had likewi&s;e &s;ome very pretty ba&s;kets of their own making, with other uten&s;ils, which plainly in|dicated a communication with foreign traders.</P>
<P>On the 29th, the boats were employed in wa|tering the &s;hips, and the &s;ail-makers, &amp;c. began to overhaul the rigging, and all hands were em|ployed in different repairs. In the mean time &s;e|veral Indians hovered round the &s;hips with fi&s;h
<PB N="246" REF="324">
ready dre&s;&s;ed, which they pre&s;ented to any indi&s;|criminately who would accept them; but would take nothing in return, except tobacco or &s;nuff were offered them; neither did they offer to &s;teal or take any the mo&s;t trifling thing away: and what was remarkable, not a woman was to be &s;een, nor did any come near the &s;hip during our &s;tay. Our Captain took notice of two that &s;eemed &s;u|perior to the re&s;t, he invited them on board, and with much entreaty prevailed on them to enter. He made them pre&s;ents of a few beads, and two or three hands of tobacco each, for which they in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner expre&s;&s;ed their gra|titude. All this while our botani&s;t and his atten|dants were bu&s;ily employed, and &s;ent plenty of celery and other whole&s;ome herbs on board, as well for the u&s;e of the great cabin as for tho&s;e of the &s;ubordinate tables, down even to the lowe&s;t of the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>On the 30th both Captains landed, in order to &s;urvey the i&s;land, and take a more accurate view of the harbour, Captain Cook intending to make this the place of rendezvous on his return: they met with &s;everal friendly Indians in their way, to whom they made pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of July the &s;ignal was given to un|moor; but, the wind &s;hifting to N. N. E. Mr. Edgar, ma&s;ter of the Di&s;covery, accompanied by &s;everal other gentlemen, made a vi&s;it to an Indian town, which they &s;aw at the di&s;tance of five or &s;ix miles, &s;ituated on the &s;ide of a plea&s;ant little hill, that &s;eemed to command a view of the bay, and of a great extent of country around. At this town they arrived about ten in the morning, when a well-looking old man made them under&s;tand he was chief of the place. To him therefore they made their addre&s;&s;es, by pre&s;enting him with &s;ome

trifles, and a &s;mall hand of tobacco. By way of return, he made &s;igns for the &s;trangers to &s;it down; and when they were &s;eated, he brought them fi&s;h of various &s;orts, dried and fre&s;h, and &s;ome dried veni&s;on, which, however, they declined to ta&s;te: ob&s;erving, therefore, that the &s;trangers wanted only to &s;atisfy their curio&s;ity, he made &s;igns for them to follow him; leading them to every hou&s;e, and, la&s;t of all, to his own. The&s;e hou&s;es were no other than &s;quare caverns dug in the ground, and latticed with rough poles, over which were laid &s;ods of earth, leaving a &s;quare hole in the middle like a hatch-way, through which to enter. They de&s;cended by means of a ladder, made by cutting notches in a beam, deep enough to re|ceive the toes and the ball of the foot; and by that ladder women and children, as well as men, run up and down like &s;o many rats, without fear of falling. The old Indian did not &s;eem willing to &s;hew the gentlemen the in&s;ide of the hou&s;es, nor were they over-&s;olicitous to examine them. The &s;mell, when they looked down, was enough to &s;atisfy them. The&s;e holes or hou&s;es, if they may be &s;o called, were &s;ome of them forty feet long, thirty broad, and about twelve feet deep. In the&s;e they never burn fire, but kindle their fires at &s;ome di&s;tance, chiefly in the night, but for what rea&s;on we could never learn. Hence it is, that &s;ailors are enabled to judge of the populou&s;|ne&s;s of a country by the number of the&s;e fires that are &s;een from the &s;hore. From the hou&s;es the old Indian led them to the &s;heds where they ma|nufactured their &s;kins; &s;hewed their manner of dre&s;&s;ing them, their &s;tore-hou&s;es, and in &s;hort, all their arts and artificers, their women only except|ed, of whom one only made her appearance, and &s;he was old, and far from being inviting. About
<PB N="248" REF="327">
eight in the afternoon the gentlemen returned; and however they might be &s;urfeited with what they had &s;een, they &s;hewed by the dinner they made that they had not lo&s;t their appetite.</P>
<P>While Mr. Edgar, &amp;c. were thus plea&s;ing them|&s;elves with one kind of amu&s;ement, Mr. Law, Sur|geon, was diverting him&s;elf with another. He went a hunting, and traced an old fox to her cover, where, after digging a con&s;iderable way, he found &s;even young ones; two of which he brought on board, and one of them lived a long time after.</P>
<P>On the 2d of July we cleared the harbour, called by the inhabitants Samganooda, &s;ituated on the North-&s;ide of Oonala&s;hka, in lat. 53.35. long. 193.30. About noon we &s;aw the land trend to S. S. E. hauled up to E. N. E. and continued all night in that cour&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 3d, at two A. M. &s;he wore &s;hip, and &s;tood to the Southward till day-light, and then tacked, and &s;teered E. N. E. At noon we &s;aw the extreme of the land, bearing E. &frac12; S.</P>
<P>On the 4th, at two A. M. we &s;teered N. N. E. At ten &s;ounded at &s;eventy fathom, blue mud, &s;helly bottom, and making very little way, our men were employed in fi&s;hing, and in le&s;s than four hours catched upwards of 800 weight of cod. At noon we had an ob&s;ervation, lat. 55.49. N. long. 195.34. Cour&s;e all night N. E.</P>
<P>On the 5th, we &s;aw the land very low and even, trending away to the Southward of the Ea&s;t. We were di&s;tant from the Northernmo&s;t &s;hore three or four leagues, and from this day we be|gan &s;ounding till our arrival in watering harbour. This day all hands employed in fi&s;hing; and as our people were now put on two-thirds allowance, what each caught he might eat or &s;ell. For|tunate for them, they caught &s;ome tons of fine
<PB N="249" REF="328">
fi&s;h, which proved a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply; for the &s;hip provi&s;ions, what with &s;alt and mag|gots eating into the beef and pork, and the rats and weavils devouring the heart of the bread, the one was little better than putrid fle&s;h, and the other, upon breaking, would crumble into du&s;t. At noon, this day, we directed our cour&s;e N. N. E. being now in lat. 56.36. long. 196.19. per watch.</P>
<P>On the 6th we continued the &s;ame cour&s;e, and, &s;ounding, found ground at twelve fathom. We tacked, and &s;tood to the S. E. and, &s;ounding again, found ground at three fathoms and a half. We were now in Beering's Straits. We tacked in&s;tantly, and &s;tood to the North, having had a|nother providential e&s;cape from running upon the rocks. We got out our boats, and &s;ounded from 7 to 5&frac12; fathom, rocky bottom for eight or nine leagues to the Northward. Lat. 57.4. long. 199.40. We were now in a mo&s;t perilous and labo|rious navigation; &s;ounding every day, and every day in danger of peri&s;hing on the rocks.</P>
<P>On the 7th &s;ounded from twelve to four fa|thom, hard bottom, with &s;hells. Lat. 57.17. long. 200.6.</P>
<P>On the 8th &s;ounded from &s;even to twenty fa|thom; &s;mall &s;hells, with &s;and. Lat. 57.46. long. 201.40. per watch.</P>
<P>On the 9th a great fog; lay by mo&s;t part of the day; &s;ounded from &s;ix to ten fathoms and a half; lat. by ob&s;ervation 58.15. long. 201.11.</P>
<P>On the 10th we had thunder, hail, and rain. The men almo&s;t exhau&s;ted with fatigue; &s;ound|ed from twelve to nine fathoms and a half. Lat. 57.58. long. 221.19.</P>
<P>The 11th we came in &s;ight of land. The air clear and plea&s;ant; we &s;teered N. W. by W. the

We&s;tward point of land in &s;ight, bearing W. &frac12; N. This day the gentlemen from both &s;hips diverted them&s;elves in &s;hooting. At noon our Captain returned on board with three &s;ea-parrots, four pigeons, &s;everal gulls, teals, and &s;hags. The&s;e parrots are in &s;ize and &s;hape not unlike tho&s;e on land, but web-footed, and their plumage diffe|rent. Numbers of them were &s;hot, and brought to England as curio&s;ities. The pigeons too are much like tho&s;e on land, but web-footed, and make a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable cooing, much like the croaking of the &s;ea-lion; &s;ounded from twelve to &s;ix fathoms. Lat. 58.11. long. 199.50.</P>
<P>On the 12th nothing material; the day was plea&s;ant, and he had a full view of the land, but &s;aw neither tree nor bu&s;h; &s;ounded from eight to &s;ixteen fathom. Latitude by ob&s;ervation 58.20.</P>
<P>The 13th, &s;ounded from eight to thirteen fa|thom. Lat. 58.13. long. 198.8.</P>
<P>The 14th we coa&s;ted along &s;hore, N. N. W. and at three in the afternoon found our&s;elves to the windward of the Southward point, with a &s;trong tide &s;etting to the S. E. About four a thick fog aro&s;e, and being within two miles of the &s;hore, came to an anchor in ten fathom wa|ter, the extreme point of land to the We&s;tward, bearing N. N. W. very high; di&s;tant between &s;ix and &s;even leagues. Sounded all day from ten to twelve fathom. Latitude by ob&s;ervation 58.20. long. 197.51.</P>
<P>The 15th, about ten in the morning, the weather clear and fine, we came to an anchor in &s;eventeen fathom water, lat. 58.24. long. 197.4. Here the cutters from both &s;hips were man|ned, and all the gentlemen went on &s;hore. We &s;aw no other inhabitants but bears and foxes, and &s;ome wild deer; we heard in the adjoining woods
<PB N="251" REF="330">
the howlings and yellings of wolves and other wild bea&s;ts; but thought it neither &s;afe nor &s;ea|&s;onable to pur&s;ue them. After &s;pending the greate&s;t part of the day in botanizing with Mr. Nel&s;on, we returned on board, leaving on the bluff part of a rock a bottle behind us, in which were enclo&s;ed &s;ome blue and white beads, with a note of the &s;hips names, the date when left, by whom, and on what expedition. We found near the &s;hore the horns of &s;ome &s;ea-mon&s;ters, from twenty to twenty-four inches long, nearly as thick as a man's leg at the root, and tapering to a point, with a gradual &s;weep. Lat. 58.24. long. 197.4. We were no &s;ooner returned than a breeze &s;prang up, when we weighed, and again made &s;ail, with the &s;hips heads W. N. W.</P>
<P>The 16th, the water &s;hallowed &s;o fa&s;t, that it was thought prudent to drop anchors again, and to &s;end the boats out with a compa&s;s to examine the &s;trait to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance a-head. In half an hour a gun was fired from the boats, as a &s;ignal not to proceed, and the man at the ma&s;t-head &s;aw land appear ju&s;t above water. This proved a barren &s;pot, not above an acre wide, with nothing but &s;hells and the bones of fi&s;hes on it. The boats having &s;ounded from W. to N. W. by N. from two to one fathom and a half, returned with their report, that no pa&s;&s;age could be found in that di|rection. From this day to the 20th, the boats were continually &s;ounding in all directions amid&s;t the mo&s;t dreadful tempe&s;t of thunder, lightning, and hail, that ever blew; but &s;uch was our dan|ger, that Capt. Cook him&s;elf &s;hared in all the la|bour: and what added to our misfortune, the Re&s;olution parted her be&s;t bower within ten fa|thoms of the anchor, and it was wonderful that &s;he was not wrecked. Lat. 58.40. long. 196.40.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="331">On the 17th all hands that could be &s;pared were employed in &s;weeping for the anchor, but in vain; being quite worn down with fatigue, they were forced to give over, and men from the Di&s;covery were ordered to &s;upply their places. Latitude by ob&s;ervation 58.53. long. 197.4.</P>
<P>On the 18th the anchor was recovered, when every officer on board both &s;hips was obliged to do the duty of common men. No pen can de|&s;cribe our danger from the horrible &s;ituation we were in.</P>
<P>The 19th was wholly employed in &s;ounding from eight to two fathom. Lat. 59.37. long. 197.17.</P>
<P>On the 20th Captain Cook him&s;elf, in &s;ound|ing to the S. E. found a narrow channel, regular &s;oundings, from eight to ten fathom. Hope took place of de&s;pair, and all hands returned to their labour with fre&s;h &s;pirits. We pre&s;ently weighed, and pur&s;ued our cour&s;e with a fine breeze. The day continuing clear, at noon we had an ob&s;er|vation in lat. 59.37. long. 197. E. This day we were vi&s;ited by &s;ome Indians, who had little to part with, except dried fi&s;h, and bows and arrows. The only peculiarity we ob&s;erved was, that mo&s;t of them had their heads &s;haved clo&s;e. They &s;eemed fonde&s;t of Otaheite and other Indian cloth, for which they would part with any thing.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, about noon, both &s;hips brought to, the wind and current both uniting to oppo&s;e our progre&s;s; founded from twelve to five fa|thoms and a half. Lat. 59.26. long. 197.18.</P>
<P>On the 22d we were overjoyed, on &s;ounding, to find the &s;ea deepen to forty fathom; but, before night that joy was much damped by a prodigious fall of &s;now, of which it was with difficulty that the decks could be kept clear, though the water

was con&s;tantly employed in &s;hovelling it off dur|ing the night. Lat. 59.11. long. 197.14. cour&s;e S. S. W.</P>
<P>The 23d made &s;ail, and &s;teered W. Lat. 58.26.</P>
<P>The 24th continued our cour&s;e W. by S.</P>
<P>The 25th lay to mo&s;t of the day, by rea&s;on of the fog. Lat. 57.43. long. 193.</P>
<P>The 26th, when it began to clear up.</P>
<P>On the 27th we had clear weather, and regular &s;oundings, from twenty-&s;even to thirty fathom; black &s;and and &s;mall &s;hells.</P>
<P>On the 28th &s;ounded all day from twenty-eight to thirty-three fathoms; &s;andy bottom.</P>
<P>On the 29th the man at the ma&s;t-head called out land very high, di&s;tance about two leagues right a-head. We tacked, and &s;tood off. Long 189.20. per watch.</P>
<P>On the 30th we continued along-&s;hore, cour&s;e N. &frac12; E. &s;ounding from twenty-five to thirty-five fathom. Lat. 61.14. long. 190.10.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t we were again alarmed with irregu|lar &s;oundings, from ten to thirty fathom, but were &s;oon relieved, by the water deepening. Lat. 31.20. long. 188.11. per watch.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t the 1&s;t, the &s;ea continued to deepen, but the land trending to the &s;outhward, obliged us to change our cour&s;e. We were now in lat. 60.59. N. long. 191.47. E.</P>
<P>On the 2d we again bore away N. W. all the morning, and at noon tacked to N. E. by N. Lat. 62.13. long. 191.33.</P>
<P>The 3d, cour&s;e all day N. N. E. This cour&s;e we pur&s;ued, with a little variation to the ea&s;tward, till the evening, when we &s;aw land, bearing S. W. di&s;tance &s;even or eight leagues. Latitude by ob|&s;ervation 63.4. long. 192.10. This day, word was brought us from the Re&s;olution of the death
<PB N="254" REF="333">
of Mr. Ander&s;on, the &s;urgeon. His funeral was performed with the u&s;ual &s;ea-ceremonies; and our &s;urgeon, Mr. Law, was appointed in his place; and Mr. Samuel, &s;urgeon's mate of the Re&s;olution, &s;ucceeded Mr. Law.</P>
<P>The 4th at noon, &s;ounding from fifteen toten fathom we came again in &s;ight of land, which bore from us W. to N. &frac12; E. At noon we &s;ounded, and found only eight fathoms and a half. In the even|ing we came to an anchor in fifteen fathom. Lat. 64.44. long. 192.7.</P>
<P>On the 5th, we came to in twelve fathom wa|ter, under the lee of a &s;mall but high i&s;land, in lat. 64.41. long. 192.14. to which Captain Cook gave the name of Sledge I&s;land, as a &s;ledge and the remains of a Ru&s;&s;ian town were found upon it, but no inhabitants. There were likewi&s;e found &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian &s;now-&s;hoes. Mr. Nel&s;on, and his a&s;&s;ociates found, on this i&s;land, great quantities of wild celery, and a kind of wild vetch or chich|ling, of which the &s;hip's company made the pro|per u&s;e.</P>
<P>Early on the 6th we weighed, and &s;tood W. by N. As we coa&s;ted along &s;hore, &s;everal Indians were &s;een on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the i&s;land, who were, to all appearance, preparing to pay us a vi&s;it. We hove to; but, after waiting an hour, and none coming, we continued our cour&s;e. We &s;oon came again into &s;hallow water, and finding the land too near us from the we&s;tern &s;hore, we altered our cour&s;e to N. N. W. &s;ounding from four to &s;ix fathom water, &s;ix leagues from the main land. We were now obliged to come to anchor, as a heavy &s;now darkened the air, and rendered our proceeding hazardous. Lat. 4.44. long. 192.42.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="334">On the 7th, judging our&s;elves near the &s;hore, though not in &s;ight, we weighed and tacked; and as the fog di&s;per&s;ed, we &s;aw the land mountainous and rocky, with neither tree nor &s;hrub in &s;ight, but exhibiting the mo&s;t dreary pro&s;pect that the mind of man can conceive. At the &s;ame time, an i&s;land was &s;een bearing N. 81. W. eight or nine leagues di&s;tant, named by us King's I&s;land. It &s;eemed of no great extent. We ha&s;tened from this horrid &s;ituation, but in the cour&s;e of the day were under the nece&s;&s;ity of coming to an anchor three times; but in launching it the la&s;t time, we ob&s;erved the &s;tock of our be&s;t bower to be &s;prung. Nothing could equal our apprehen&s;ions. We immediately made &s;ignals, and acquainted our Commodore with our di&s;tre&s;s. Fortunately, the &s;tock of an un&s;erviceable be&s;t-bower hung over our &s;ide, which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the carpenters and &s;miths of the Re&s;olution, added to our own, was in le&s;s than twenty-four hours, though under every di&s;advantage, &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of the other, and rendered perfectly &s;afe. And happy it was, for</P>
<P>On the 8th, we had a violent &s;torm of hail, rain and &s;now, which continued all the morning; but the wind dying away about noon, and the current &s;etting to the N. E. we were drifted to leeward clo&s;e in &s;hore, under a very high track of land, and among rocks and breakers. Both &s;hips in&s;tantly came to in 9 fathom water, the Re&s;olution with her be&s;t-bower, within two miles of the &s;hore, and the Di&s;covery with her coa&s;ting anchor. Here we &s;aw high land, extending from N. by W. to N. W. by N. di&s;tant about three leagues. Over the we&s;tern extreme was an elevated peaked hill, &s;ituated in lat. 65.36. and in long. 192.18. Under this hill lies &s;ome low land, &s;tretching out
<PB N="256" REF="335">
to the N. W. the extreme point of which bore F. by E. This point of land is the more re|markable, being the we&s;tern extremity of all Ame|rica hitherto known, and named by Capt. Cook <HI>Cape Prince of Wales.</HI> And now a breeze &s;pring|ing up in our favour, we quitted this perilous &s;ituation; and &s;eeing the land trend away to the N. W. we directed our cour&s;e accordingly, till, having doubled the we&s;ternmo&s;t point, we &s;teered again to the ea&s;tward, and continued that cour&s;e the whole night.</P>
<P>On the 9th about 2 A. M. we came again to an anchor, a &s;trong current from 5 to 6 knots an hour &s;etting again&s;t us; but the &s;hips pitching bows under, and the water from the upper deck run|ning, as through a &s;ieve, to the lower deck, in le&s;s than half an hour, every thing between decks was afloat, &s;o that the poor men had not a dry rag to put on. This obliged us to weigh as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible; but, in our &s;ituation, that was a work of no &s;mall labour and difficulty, as at this time many of our hands, through fatigue, and being con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the rain and &s;now, and in a damp &s;hip, were ill of colds, attended with &s;low fevers, which rendered them incapable of duty. Out of 70 hands, officers included, we could only mu&s;ter 20 to the cap&s;tern. We had with difficulty weighed our &s;mall bower, and had made two un|&s;ucce&s;sful attempts at the &s;heet anchor, when the Re&s;olution left us, making all the &s;ail &s;he could carry, to &s;urmount the current. We were now in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; but by contriving &s;everal ad|ditional purcha&s;es we at la&s;t &s;ucceeded, with the misfortune, however, of having two of our able&s;t hands wounded; and it was next to a miracle that none were killed. The Re&s;olution was now out of &s;ight, but, judging our di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he lay to amid&s;t
<PB N="257" REF="336">
a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, of which we told no le&s;s than &s;even, very &s;mall but very high. As &s;oon as we came in &s;ight, &s;he made &s;ail, and we followed with all the &s;ail we could crowd till about mid|night, when we were &s;urpri&s;ed by a &s;udden &s;quall, which &s;plit our main top-&s;ail, and &s;hivered our jib to ribbons; it was, however, of &s;hort conti|nuance. Lat. 65.46. long. 191.45.</P>
<P>On the 10th, we had fine weather and a calm &s;ea, and were proceeding, at a great rate, our cour&s;e W. when, unexpectedly we opened into a deep bay, where we &s;aw at the di&s;tance of a few leagues, a large Indian town, which our Commo|dore at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed to belong to the i&s;land of Ala&s;chka; but from the figure of the coa&s;t, the &s;ituation of the oppo&s;ite &s;hore of America, and from the longitude, he found rea&s;on to alter his opinion, and to conclude that it was a part of the country of T&s;chut&s;ki, or the ea&s;tern extremity of A&s;ia, explored by Beering in 1728. Long 189.25. Here we ca&s;t anchor in 13 fathom water, and both Captains, attended by a proper guard went on &s;hore. About 30 or 40 men, each armed with a &s;pontoon, a bow and arrows, &s;tood drawn up on a ri&s;ing ground clo&s;e by the village. As we drew near, three of them came down towards the &s;hore, and were &s;o polite as to take off their caps, and to make us low bows. We returned the civility, but this did not in&s;pire them with &s;ufficient con|fidence; for the moment we advanced, they re|tired. Capt. Cook followed them alone, with|out any thing in his hand; and by &s;igns, prevailed on them to receive &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents. In re|turn, they gave him two fox &s;kins, and a couple of &s;ea-hor&s;e teeth. They &s;eemed very cautious; expre&s;&s;ing their de&s;ire by &s;igns, that no more of our people might be permitted to come up. On

Capt. Cook's laying his hand on the &s;houlder of one of them, he &s;tarted back, and in proportion as the Captain advanced, the natives retreated; al|ways in the attitude of being ready to make u&s;e of their &s;pears, while tho&s;e on the ri&s;ing ground &s;tood ready to &s;upport them with their arrows. In&s;en|&s;ibly, a few of our people got in among them; but a few beads being di&s;tributed to tho&s;e about them, &s;oon created a confidence, and, by degrees, a &s;ort of traffic commenced. In exchange for knives, beads, tobacco, and other articles, they gave us &s;ome of their clothing, and a few arrows; but no|thing could induce them to part with a &s;pear, or a bow. The&s;e they held in con&s;tant readine&s;s, never quitting them, except at one time, when four or five of them laid theirs down, while they gave us a &s;ong and a dance. Their arrows were pointed either with bone or &s;tone, but very few of them had barbs, and &s;ome were blunted. The u&s;e they made of the&s;e was, probably, to kill &s;mall animals, without damaging their &s;kins. The bows were &s;uch as we had &s;een u&s;ed by the Ame|rican E&s;quimaux. The &s;pears or &s;pontoons were of iron or &s;teel, of European or A&s;iatic workman|&s;hip, curiou&s;ly ornamented with carvings and inlayings of bra&s;s and white metal. Tho&s;e who &s;tood ready with their bows and arrows, had their &s;pears &s;lung over their right &s;houlders; a qui|ver &s;lung over their left with arrows; &s;ome of their quivers were extremely beautiful, being made of red leather, on which were very neat em|broidery, and other ornaments. Several other things, and in particular their clothing, &s;hewed they were not de&s;titute of ingenuity.</P>
<P>All the Americans we had &s;een &s;ince our ar|rival on that coa&s;t, were rather low of &s;tature, with round chubby faces, and high cheek bones.
<PB N="259" REF="338">
The people we now were among, had long vi&s;|ages, and were &s;tout and well-made. In &s;hort, they appeared to be a quite different nation. We &s;aw neither women nor children; nor any aged, except one man, who was bald-headed, and carried no arms. The other &s;eemed to be picked men, and rather under than above the middle age. All of them had their ears bored, and &s;ome of them had gla&s;s beads hanging to them. The&s;e were the only fixed ornaments we &s;aw among them, for they wore none to their lips; in which they e&s;&s;en|tially differ from their American neighbours.</P>
<P>Their clothing con&s;i&s;ted of a cap, a frock, a pair of breeches, a pair of boots, and a pair of gloves, all made of the &s;kins of deer, dogs, &s;eals, &amp;c. extremely well dre&s;&s;ed; &s;ome with the hair or fur on, and others without. The caps were made to fit the head very clo&s;e; and, be&s;ides the&s;e caps, which mo&s;t of them wore, we got from them &s;ome hoods made of the &s;kins of dogs, large enough to cover both head and &s;houlders. Their hair &s;eemed to be black, but their heads were either &s;haved, or the hair cut clo&s;e off, and none of them wore any beard. Of the articles they got from us, knives and tobacco they valued mo&s;t.</P>
<P>We found the village compo&s;ed both of their &s;ummer and their winter habitations. The latter are exactly like vaults, the floors of which are &s;unk a little below the &s;urface of the earth, and boarded, and under them a kind of cellar, in which we &s;aw nothing but water. At the end of each hou&s;e was a vaulted room, which we took to be a &s;tore-room. Over it &s;tood a kind of &s;entry-box or tower, compo&s;ed of the large bones of large fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer-huts were pretty large and conical. The framing was of light poles and bones, covered
<PB N="260" REF="339">
with the &s;kins of &s;ea-animals. We examined the in&s;ide of one. There was a fire-place ju&s;t within the door, near which lay a few wooden ve&s;&s;els, all very dirty. Their bed-places were clo&s;e to the &s;ides. Some privicies &s;eemed to be ob&s;erved, for there were &s;everal partitions made of &s;kins. The bed and bedding were of deer-&s;kins, and mo&s;t of them were dry and clean.</P>
<P>About the&s;e habitations were &s;everal &s;tages, ten or twelve feet high, for drying their fi&s;h and &s;kins out of the reach of their dogs, of which they had many; large and of different colours, with long &s;oft hair, like wool; probably u&s;ed in drawing the &s;ledges, for &s;ledges they had in their huts. Perhaps the&s;e dogs, being numerous, may con&s;titute a part of their food; for &s;everal of them lay dead, that had been killed that morning.</P>
<P>Their canoes are of the &s;ame &s;ort with tho&s;e of the Northern Americans.</P>
<P>By the large fi&s;h-bones, and of other &s;ea-ani|mals, that lay &s;cattered about, it appears, that the &s;ea &s;upplies them with the greate&s;t part of their &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>After a &s;tay of about two or three hours with the&s;e people, we returned to our &s;hips, and pur+&s;ued our voyage.</P>
<P>On the 11th we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal large i&s;lands to the ea&s;tward of us, and at the &s;ame time left the extreme point of the northern cape of A&s;ia, which we &s;aw trend away to the W. by S. as far as the eye could carry, mo&s;tly high land, barren and co|vered with &s;now. We then bore away to the north-ea&s;t, &s;ounding from 5 to 6 fathom, and about 3 P. M. finding the &s;ea to change of a milky colour, and at the &s;ame time to &s;hallow very fa&s;t, we came to in 7 fathom water, and &s;ent the boats out to &s;ound, who &s;oon returned, finding
<PB N="261" REF="340">
the &s;ea to deepen as they proceeded. We then got under way, &s;tanding all night N. one half W. pa&s;&s;ing in the night &s;everal large &s;ea cows and other &s;ea mon&s;ters. Lat. 66.5. long. 191.19.</P>
<P>On the 12th we altered our cour&s;e, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, when both &s;hips tacked, and plyed to the North, leaving two very &s;mall i&s;lands on our &s;tarboard bow. In the evening we cro&s;&s;ed the arctic circle, and &s;tood all night W. by S. 66.35. long 189.39.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 13th we &s;tood once more north ea&s;tward. We were now in lat 66.40. and from 20 to 40 fathom water, the weather warm and fine. We altered our cour&s;e and &s;teered all night N. N. E.</P>
<P>On the 14th in the morning, we hauled our wind and &s;tood with the &s;hip's head to the N. E. About 5 in the afternoon we came in &s;ight of land, di&s;tance about 5 or 6 leagues, very high, woody, and covered with &s;now; we &s;tood in for land; but finding the coa&s;t rugged, and the wa|ter &s;hoal, we &s;tood again W. S. W. and continued that cour&s;e the whole night. Lat. 67.27. long. 191.40.</P>
<P>On the 15th, finding our&s;elves attacked by a heavy &s;torm of wind, attended with rain, we bore away N. W. by W. and continued that cour&s;e till the evening, when we &s;hortened &s;ail and &s;tood to the &s;outhward. Lat. ob&s;. 68.18. long. 192.37.</P>
<P>On the 16th at noon we found our&s;elves in lat. 69.46. long. 192. E. We then &s;tood from N. N. E. to N. E. &s;ounding from 22 to 23 fathom water. Lat. 69.46. long. 192.</P>
<P>On the 17th the weather began to grow pierce|ing cold. The fro&s;t &s;et in, and froze &s;o hard that the running rigging was &s;oon loaded with ice, and rendered almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to make the &s;heafs or
<PB N="262" REF="341">
blocks traver&s;e without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ix men to do the work of one. But what was mo&s;t re|markable, was the &s;udden tran&s;ition from heat to &s;uch &s;evere cold. The day before was warm and plea&s;ant, but in the evening of this day the ice was &s;een hanging at our hair, our no&s;es, and even at the men's fingers ends, if they did but expo&s;e them to the air for five or &s;ix minutes: and &s;till the farther they ran to the ea&s;tward, the colder it grew, and the ice the more connected. About 2 in the afternoon we found our&s;elves &s;urrounded with large floating i&s;lands of ice, which, like clouds in the &s;ky, were continually varying their appearances; but the farther we ran to the ea&s;t|ward, the clo&s;er the ice became compacted. As the weather was now clear, though piercing cold, we could &s;ee the ice extending on every &s;ide E. and W. as far as the eye could carry. We &s;tood to the northward, and being embayed, we ob&s;erved a large i&s;land floating, with the tide towards us, whereon was &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;t great numbers of &s;ea-mon&s;ters. Being apprehen&s;ive of danger, the &s;ignal was made for tacking. We kept off and on all night. Lat. 70.41. long. 197.</P>
<P>On the 18th, hot victuals froze while we were at table; and this weather continued for &s;ome days. Being now well in with the ice, and having lo&s;t &s;ight of land, we kept working to the we&s;tward. At noon a great fog came on, but &s;oon clearing up, the &s;un made his appearance, and we had an ob&s;ervation, by which we found we were in lat. 70.54. long. 198.17. About eight at night it blew a gale, with heavy &s;now; we &s;hortened &s;ail, and &s;tood to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>The 19th when looking round in the morning, as &s;oon as the fog cleared away, we &s;aw nothing but fields of ice covered with whole herds of &s;ea-lions,
<PB N="263" REF="342">
&s;ea-hor&s;es, and other amphibious animals, to the number, as it was thought, of &s;ome thou|&s;ands. Thus &s;urrounded, a &s;ignal was made from the Re&s;olution to bring to, and to load the great guns, while the boats were getting ready to attack the&s;e hideous looking creatures with mu&s;kets. This, by the &s;ailors from both &s;hips, was accounted &s;port; and they went to the attack with as much alacrity as if to a match at foot-ball. Orders were given, as &s;oon as the great guns were di&s;charged, to quicken the attack with the mu&s;ketry as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. In a few minutes not a creature was to be &s;een upon the ice but &s;uch as were killed, or &s;o &s;everely wounded as not to be able to crawl to the open &s;ea. Some lay growling on the ice not quite dead, with two or three balls through their heads, and others tumbling about with horrible vindictive looks, threatening de&s;truction to who|ever &s;hould approach them. The&s;e mon&s;ters, when at their growth, are in length from the head to the hindmo&s;t fin from eleven to twelve feet; round the belly from twenty to twenty-&s;ix feet. Four long &s;tiff fins &s;erve them for feet, with which they crawl or &s;lide upon the ice, and move with wonderful agility; two large tu&s;ks, at the di&s;tance of 7 or 8 inches apart, project from the no&s;trils, in length from twenty inches to two feet four, thick at the root, and tapering to a point; their forehead re&s;embles that of a bull. They have whi&s;kers on each &s;ide the mouth, about &s;ix inches long, as &s;tiff as a knitting-needle, with which they rai&s;e them&s;elves upon the ice. Their eyes are &s;mall. They have no teeth; nor have they any tail. They have, like the &s;eals, &s;ome little hair upon their &s;kins, but very thin; and are, upon the whole, mo&s;t horribly ugly creatures. After the engagement was over, all hands were employed
<PB N="264" REF="343">
to collect the carca&s;&s;es, and to carry them on board; but what was thought an ill reward for their labour, orders were next day given by Capt. Cook to &s;ub&s;titute the fle&s;h of the&s;e &s;ea-mon&s;ters in the room of all other provi&s;ions, bread or flour only excepted. This was &s;trongly oppo&s;ed by the crew of the Re&s;olution, and Capt. Clerke remon|&s;trated again&s;t it. He was told by Capt. Cook, that he might do as he plea&s;ed on board his own &s;hip; but the &s;tate of the provi&s;ions on board the Re&s;olution made it nece&s;&s;ary, and that he him&s;elf &s;hould &s;et the example. Capt. Clerke endeavoured, but in vain, to enforce the order, and the matter pa&s;&s;ed on without any &s;erious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>On the 20th we tacked &s;hip, and &s;tood to the we&s;tward, the wind much again&s;t us. We tacked every two hours, &s;till working over to the A&s;iatic &s;hore, with a view to examine the coa&s;ts on both &s;ides, before we returned to the &s;outhward. We were now in lat. 70.54. long. 194.55.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, we came in &s;ight of the continent of America, extending from S. by E. to E. by S. the neare&s;t part five leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P>We continued labouring among the ice till the 25th, when a &s;torm came on, which made it dan|gerous for us to proceed; a con&s;ultation was there|fore held on board the Re&s;olution as &s;oon as the violence of the gale abated, when it was unani|mou&s;ly re&s;olved, that as this pa&s;&s;age was imprac|ticable for any u&s;eful purpo&s;e of navigation, which was the great object of the voyage, to pur&s;ue it no farther, e&s;pecially in the condition the &s;hips were in, the winter approaching, and the di&s;tance from any known place of refre&s;hment great.</P>
<P>About two in the morning of the 26th we ob|&s;erved a great body of ice nearing us very fa&s;t, and in a few hours after we &s;aw the ice all clo&s;ed as far
<PB N="265" REF="344">
as the eye could carry, bearing from N. E. to S. W. We continued to &s;ail W. S. W.</P>
<P>On the 28th &s;everal pieces of loo&s;e ice pa&s;&s;ed us, one of which came &s;oul of the Di&s;covery, and &s;hook her whole frame; it was feared &s;he had re|ceived con&s;iderable damage, but upon the carpen|ters examining her &s;ore and aft, nothing was found ami&s;s. We now took leave of the ice for this &s;ea|&s;on, directing our cour&s;e S. S. W.</P>
<P>On the 29th we &s;aw land in the morning, which bore from N. N. W. to S. W. very high, and covered with &s;now. At two, P. M. we were in with the land. It &s;howed it&s;elf in two hills, like i&s;lands; but afterwards &s;eemed connected, and appeared in every re&s;pect like the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of America. In the low ground, lying between the high land and the &s;ea, was a lake, extending to the S. E. farther than we could &s;ee.</P>
<P>The 30th, at two, A. M. bore away E. by S. At &s;even &s;aw land; the extreme of which bore S. E. At two, P. M. &s;aw more land, trending to the &s;outhward. At this time came in &s;ight of a narrow channel that &s;eemed to lead to the lake, which we had &s;een the day before. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">led our wind, and &s;tood N. E. by E. In the evening we were in with the land, and not a &s;hrub to be &s;een, but birds innumerable, chiefly &s;ea parrots.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, at day-light, we came in &s;ight of the ea&s;tern cape, named <HI>Cape North,</HI> bearing S. S. E. very high, and covered with &s;now: we were then di&s;tant from the neare&s;t &s;hore four or five leagues. Continued our cour&s;e from S. S. E. to S. E. by E. At noon the extreme of the &s;outh|ward point bore S. W. by S. At three, P. M. we &s;aw two &s;mall, but very high i&s;lands, bearing from N. N. E. to N. W. which we left to the northward. We were then in lat. 68.56. and
<PB N="266" REF="345">
long. 180.51. At night both &s;hips tacked to the we&s;tward. This day we pa&s;&s;ed an i&s;land, to which Capt. Cook gave the name of Burney's I&s;land.</P>
<P>Sept. 1, we continued coa&s;ting to the ea&s;tward, as the land trended; di&s;tance about four miles from the &s;hore. Here Capt. Cook took occa&s;ion to fix the Ea&s;tern point of the A&s;iatic Continent. It &s;hews, he &s;ays, a &s;teep rocky cliff facing the &s;ea, and lies in the lat. 67.3. and long. 188.11.</P>
<P>On the 2d we continued coa&s;ting along &s;hore. Cour&s;e all day S. S. E. Saw many very high trees, &s;uppo&s;ed to be pines.</P>
<P>On the 3d we opened into the great bay, called the bay of St. Lawrence, where we anchored the 10th of la&s;t month; but what was remarkable, none of the inhabitants, whom we had vi&s;ited, of|fered to approach us, though the weather was favourable.</P>
<P>On the 4th &s;tood W. N. W. right in for the land. At &s;ix, A. M. bore away S. &frac12; W. the ea&s;ternmo&s;t point of land bearing S. by E. di&s;|tance &s;ix or &s;even leagues, and &s;o continued all day. At night &s;tood E. N. E.</P>
<P>On the 5th we lo&s;t &s;ight of the main continent of A&s;ia, which we left the day before. Lat. 64.7. long. 189.1.</P>
<P>On the 6th we &s;aw land from W. N. W. to E. N. E. very woody, and covered with &s;now in the vallies. Here we found our&s;elves in &s;ight of Sledge-I&s;land, near the continent of America; and here Capt. Cook was de&s;irous of di&s;covering the i&s;land of Ala&s;chk&s;ka, which the Ru&s;&s;ians had de|&s;cribed as abounding with wood and water.</P>
<P>On the 7th, there came two canoes from the &s;hore, with four Indians in them, though we were di&s;tant full four leagues. We hove to for their
<PB N="267" REF="346">
coming up; but when along-&s;ide, they had little or nothing to part with, except &s;ome dried fi&s;h. They were invited on board, but could not be per&s;uaded to enter. The Captain made them pre&s;ents of &s;ome trifles, with which they departed well plea&s;ed. They were clothed in &s;kins, after the manner of all the inhabitants of the We&s;tern coa&s;ts of America, among whom we found a re|markable uniformity of dre&s;s and colour.</P>
<P>On the 8th, we &s;teered E. &frac12; N. pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal bays and fine harbours all day; found the country plea&s;ant, and the coa&s;t delightful. Lat. 64.22. long. 197. beyond which the coa&s;t took a more Northerly cour&s;e. Here we found a &s;trong cur|rent to &s;et to the S. E. at the rate of five knots an hour.</P>
<P>On the 9th, at five, A. M. land appeared from S. E. to E. like two i&s;lands, but, after fatigue|ing trials, we found them join to the main land. At four, P. M. the land opened all round, from one &s;hore to the other; and we found our&s;elves in the middle of a deep bay, but very &s;hallow, &s;ome|times three, but never above five fathoms and a half water. At this time, a head-land on the We&s;t &s;hore, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Bald Head,</HI> lay N. by W. one league di&s;tant. We &s;aw the bay to run as far as the eye could carry, but im|po&s;&s;ible to proceed, as in many places the water &s;hallowed under three fathom. We &s;tood off and on all night.</P>
<P>On the 10th, having a &s;tiff breeze, we ran right acro&s;s the mouth of the bay, for the N. W. &s;hore, and ju&s;t before night the Re&s;olution nar|rowly e&s;caped running upon a rock. This day, Capt. Cook landed on a narrow border of land which joined to the beech, and which was covered with gra&s;s and heath, with a variety of wild ber|ries,
<PB N="268" REF="347">
but rather over-ripe. He ob&s;erved traces of foxes and deer upon the beech, but none were caught; on each &s;ide of this penin&s;ula the coa&s;t forms a bay. The projecting point of this pe|nin&s;ula, obtained the name of <HI>Cape Denbeigh.</HI> Several natives were &s;een on the penin&s;ula, and one came off, to whom Capt. Cook gave a knife, and a&s;ked him for &s;omething to eat. The man paddled off; and meeting with another man, with two dried &s;almon in his canoe, took them from him, and brought them to the Captain.</P>
<P>On the 11th, we came to anchor, in &s;ix fathom water, di&s;tance from the &s;hore about four miles; the Ea&s;ternmo&s;t point of the bay bearing N. E. by E. di&s;tance about eight miles, very high land. In the night, we &s;aw &s;everal fires, but no Indians came off to us.</P>
<P>On the 12th, in the morning, the boats from both &s;hips were &s;ent on &s;hore, where they &s;aw &s;ome hou&s;es of a wretched con&s;truction; a &s;mall &s;ledge, and &s;everal other articles belonging to the Indians, but none of the natives. About ten, they re|turned with a load of wood, which they found drifted on the beech, but no water; the wood had drifted from the Southward, for we &s;aw no trees, but black &s;pruce. We then &s;tretched over to the other &s;hore, and the boats were again &s;ent out, and about nine in the evening returned, loaded with wood, which the men were obliged to carry through the water on their &s;houlders, as the boats could not come within half a mile of land, for breakers. This was a grievous ta&s;k, as many of them but ju&s;t recovered their late illne&s;s. This day &s;everal natives came from the S. S. E. &s;ide, in large canoes, having great quantities of &s;almon, dried and fre&s;h, which they exchanged for blue and red beads, needles, pins, knives, or &s;ci&s;&s;ars,
<PB N="269" REF="348">
or any European trinkets that were offered them; but what they valued mo&s;t was <HI>tobacco.</HI> For this they would exchange their bows and arrows, their warlike in&s;truments, and whatever el&s;e they valued mo&s;t; but of this commodity, as has already been noticed, we had but little to &s;pare. We were again obliged to change our &s;tation, and &s;tretch to the other &s;hore, where a &s;afe anchorage was di&s;covered, near which we could get wood and water with the greate&s;t ea&s;e. We now &s;tood more to the Southward, in order to avoid tho&s;e breakers we &s;o narrowly e&s;caped before; and next day our great cutter was &s;ent out, properly pro|vided with a compa&s;s, and &s;ix days provi&s;ion, to &s;urvey the bay, with a view to determine whether that land to which the Ru&s;&s;ians have given the name of Ala&s;kah, joined to the American conti|nent, or whether there was not a pa&s;&s;age through the bay to the Northward. While the cutters were on this &s;ervice, the boats continued wooding and watering, and before the return of the former, the latter had got the full complement of both on board, and the &s;hips were in readine&s;s to depart.</P>
<P>The 13th, ca&s;t anchor in four fathoms and a half water, within a mile and a half from the mouth of a great river, from whence before night we had got more than 20 tons of water; we had likewi&s;e got a con&s;iderable quantity of wood from the &s;hore. This day a family of the natives came near the place where we were taking off the wood, mi&s;erable looking objects, who for four knives made out of an iron hoop, parted with more than 400 lb. weight of fi&s;h, which they had caught this and the preceding day.</P>
<P>On the 14th, the men had leave to go a&s;hore by turns to gather berries, which they now found ripe, and in great abundance, &s;uch as ra&s;berries,
<PB N="270" REF="349">
blue-berries, black and red currants, huckle ber|ries, with various other &s;orts, all in full perfec|tion. A party was likewi&s;e &s;ent out to cut &s;pruce, to brew into beer for both &s;hips. Of this liquor, however, the men were not very fond in this cold climate, e&s;pecially when they were given to un|der&s;tand that their grog was to be &s;topped, and this beer &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of it. This oc|ca&s;ioned great murmuring, and it was found ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give it alternately, &s;pruce one day, and grog another.</P>
<P>On their excur&s;ions, the parties were always well armed, and had marines to attend them; and their orders were never to go out of hearing of the &s;hips guns, but to repair in&s;tantly on board on the proper &s;ignals. The&s;e precautions, however, &s;eemed unnece&s;&s;ary, as they never met with any mole&s;tation from the natives, who were not nu|merous upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 17th, the party that were &s;ent out to &s;urvey the bay returned, after a diligent examina|tion of two days and two nights. Their report was, that from the elevated &s;pot from which they had taken their &s;urvey, they could &s;ee the inlet terminate in a con&s;iderable river, which emptied it&s;elf into the &s;ea at the head of the bay; that in its cour&s;e it watered many mo&s;t delightful vallies, which were bounded on every &s;ide with hills of a moderate height, inter&s;per&s;ed with mountains or a &s;tupendous height. This report being con|firmed by the officers who commanded the cutters from both &s;hips, the boats were all taken on board and &s;ecured, and wood and water having been plentifully &s;upplied, the bay and &s;ound ex|amined, and the exact &s;ituation determined to be lat. 64.31. and long. 197.13. there remained no|thing but to name the &s;ound, and take our leave.

In honour of Sir Fletcher Norton, then Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to whom Lieut. King had the honour to be nearly related, it was named Norton Sound, called by the natives Chacktoole.</P>
<P>On the 18th, we weighed and &s;ailed, retracing Beering's Straits, which we had before explored, without any material accident, though we found the water to &s;hallow, in&s;omuch that we were forced to abandon the thoughts of pa&s;&s;ing between Be&s;|borough I&s;land and the main, to more than &s;ix miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 19th, &s;hoal water obliged us to haul to the We&s;tward, by which the whole coa&s;t from 63 to 60 remains unexplored; within which, from &s;everal indications, it &s;hould &s;eem that a con&s;ider|able river runs into the &s;ea.</P>
<P>On the 20th, about two P. M. we came in &s;ight of land, which appeared like two i&s;lands. Lat. 63.19. and at &s;ix in the evening came up with it, but found both i&s;lands in one, without either bu&s;h or tree. Cour&s;e S. W.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, &s;aw a great number of i&s;lands; but they too, when we approached them, ap|peared all in one. Lat. 62.56. Cour&s;e S. S. W.</P>
<P>On the 24th, we met with a dreadful tempe&s;t of wind, rain, and hail, or rather ice, between two and three inches &s;quare, by which &s;everal of our men, who were obliged to keep the deck, were &s;everely wounded. In this long run, we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal remarkable promontaries and i&s;lands, particularly in lat. 63.30. N. we pa&s;&s;ed two head-lands, di&s;tance from each other about half a mile. We hove-to, and our boats &s;ounded acro&s;s, in &s;ome places not above one fathom and a half. In lat. 62.56. we came in &s;ight of a clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, as we imagined; but on our nearer approach, found them all in one, barren, and without a
<PB N="272" REF="351">
&s;hrub or tree. In lat. 60.12. we came up with a &s;tupendous rock or high i&s;land, almo&s;t covered with &s;now, and without any other inhabitants ex|cept birds and &s;eals; to this la&s;t Capt. Cook gave the name of Winter I&s;land, from its dreary appearance.</P>
<P>On the 26th, the Re&s;olution made the &s;ignal of di&s;tre&s;s. On hailing her we were informed, that &s;he had again &s;prung a leak in the late violent gale, and that all hands were employed at the pumps and in baleing; and that it was with dif|ficulty they could keep her above water. Lat. 58.39.</P>
<P>On the 29th, we were again vi&s;ited with a &s;evere &s;torm, and involved in heavy &s;eas, our hull being &s;ometimes entirely under water, and the waves ri&s;ing to the yard-arms. About midnight it came on to &s;now, and the Re&s;olution kept making &s;ig|nals and firing guns all night. At day-light, we &s;aw her di&s;tant five or &s;ix miles. We &s;hortened &s;ail, and waited for her coming up. And,</P>
<P>On the 30th, being both in company, the &s;torm abated and the &s;ea quite calm, both &s;hips hove-to, and, while the carpenters were employed in &s;topping the leak in the Re&s;olution, the people were bu&s;ied in fi&s;hing. Tho&s;e on board the Di&s;|covery caught 40 large cod, be&s;ides turbot, which were the more acceptable to officers and men, as our &s;alt provi&s;ions were now very bad. Lat. 56.30. N.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of October, we continued our cour&s;e to the Southward. Lat. ob&s;. 55.27. And</P>
<P>On the 2d, about five in the morning, we made land; and hauled our wind in &s;earch of Samga|noodo Harbour, on the i&s;land of Oomala&s;hka, of which we had mi&s;taken the entrance. About &s;ix in the evening we came in &s;ight of a large Indian
<PB N="273" REF="352">
town in a deep bay, where we found our&s;elves &s;ur|rounded with whales of a prodigious &s;ize. We &s;ounded, and found no bottom at 100 fathoms. Here &s;ome of our former friends came off to us, and being informed that our de&s;ign was to anchor in our late harbour, they undertook to be our pi|lots, and one of them &s;lept all night on board the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>On the 3d, in the morning, we found our|&s;elves right a-brea&s;t the Race, and &s;aw the Re&s;o|lution ju&s;t within the entrance. About two in the afternoon, the wind and tide both uniting in our favour, we &s;afely anchored in our late birth.</P>
<P>All hands were now &s;et to work, the carpenters in &s;tripping the &s;heathing from the Re&s;olution to examine her leaks, and the &s;ail-makers, caulkers, and riggers, in their re&s;pective employments, for which there was great need, both &s;hips having &s;uffered much in their &s;ails, &s;eams, and rigging, in the late tempe&s;tuous weather, and in the icy Northern &s;eas; but what gave the greate&s;t plea|&s;ure to the &s;eamen, was the &s;ucce&s;s they met with in fi&s;hing, whenever the weather was &s;uch as to &s;uffer them to haul the &s;eine. At the mouth of the harbour, they could at any time, in three or four hours, fill their boats with holybut of an enormous &s;ize; one of them, &s;ent on board the Re&s;olution, during our &s;tay, weighed 220 lb.&mdash;Each me&s;s had now a &s;mall ca&s;k with a quantity of &s;alt given them, in order to make &s;ome provi|&s;ion to help out their &s;hort allowance, which it was found nece&s;&s;ary to continue till their arrival in the tropical i&s;lands, where the &s;hips might again be furni&s;hed with a frefh &s;upply.</P>
<P>On the 4th, our Captain went on board the Commodore, where he was acquainted by Capt. Cook with the di&s;tre&s;s of the Re&s;olution, which
<PB N="274" REF="353">
ever &s;ince the hard gale on the 26th had been ready to founder; on that day, on &s;ounding the pumps, three feet water were found in the well; and judging the leak to proceed from the &s;ame place as before, the carpenters were employed in &s;earch of it, when, to their great &s;urprize, they found the full ca&s;ks afloat, and great quantities of pro|vi&s;ions utterly &s;poilt. Their fir&s;t care was to &s;kuttle the bulk-heads, and to let the water down into the hold, and then the pumps were kept con&s;tantly at work to pump it out; but this was beyond their power; they could gain but little with ince&s;&s;ant labour, and when they came into harbour had 28 inches &s;till in the hold. The carpenters had already &s;tript the &s;ides of the Re&s;olution 16 feet from the counter forwards, where they found the in&s;ide timbers &s;o much de|cayed, that their report was, if their continuance at &s;ea had been nece&s;&s;arily protracted a fortnight longer, &s;he mu&s;t have gone to the bottom.</P>
<P>We had &s;till much to do, our articles for the tropical trade were nearly all exchanged, and we could expect no &s;upplies of provi&s;ions without an equivalent. We therefore &s;ent a &s;mall &s;pare bower anchor on &s;hore, and &s;et our armourers to break it up, and make it into &s;pikes, axes, hatchets, nails, and other tropical merchandize.</P>
<P>While every thing was getting ready, the of|ficers diverted them&s;elves as u&s;ual with &s;hoot|ing and &s;urveying the country; and here they found amu&s;ement enough, having di&s;covered a Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ettlement, divided only by a neck of land about 15 miles over, and a bay of about 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> miles, which they had to cro&s;s. From this &s;et|tlement Capt. Cook received a very &s;ingular pre+&s;ent. It was a rye-loaf, or rather a pye, inclo&s;ing &s;ome &s;almon very nicely &s;ea&s;oned. The man who
<PB N="275" REF="354">
brought it was named Derramou&s;hk, and brought likewi&s;e a pre&s;ent for Capt. Clerke. The&s;e came from &s;ome Ru&s;&s;ian gentlemen &s;ettled in that neigh|bourhood. In return &s;ome bottles of rum, wine and porter were &s;ent back by the &s;ame hand; and Corporal Lediard of the marines, a very intelli|gent per&s;on, &s;ent to gain information, who &s;oon returned with three Ru&s;&s;ian &s;eamen and furriers, who, when they fir&s;t di&s;covered us at a di&s;tance from the &s;hore, were apprehen&s;ive that we were Japane&s;e, with whom their nation was at war; but on our nearer approach, they were convinced from the trim of our &s;hips that we were &s;trangers; they were therefore encouraged, by the report of the natives, to make them&s;elves known, and to of|fer their a&s;&s;i&s;tance as far as lay in their power. The&s;e were received with open arms; generou&s;ly entertained, and a very friendly intercour&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The road acro&s;s the neck of land was rather rugged, but when that was &s;urmounted, the com|munication was ea&s;y. Some of our gentlemen who went to return the vi&s;it, were met by an of|ficer, who received them politely, and directed them to the factory, where, be&s;ides the fort, they found a Ru&s;&s;ian bark of about 50 or 60 tons, eight &s;mall &s;wivels, and one three pounder laid up for the winter, and intended for Kam&s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ka the en&s;uing &s;ummer. Our gentlemen were here &s;hewn the &s;tores belonging to the factory, con|&s;i&s;ting of &s;kins and oil; their coppers for boiling the oil, with the &s;mall ware with which they traf|ficked with the natives by way of exchange. Iron in&s;truments of war are prohibited, nor do they &s;uffer any offen&s;ive weapons of any kind to be introduced among them. It is probable there|fore, that the long knives we &s;aw in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the more &s;outherly Indians, were &s;ome that were
<PB N="276" REF="355">
taken from tho&s;e unfortunate Ru&s;&s;ians, who, on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of this continent, fell a &s;acri|fice to the &s;avage barbarity of the natives. It was a little unfortunate, that we had not one per|&s;on on board either &s;hip that had the mo&s;t di&s;tant knowledge of the Ru&s;s language; every thing was to be under&s;tood by &s;igns. Our officers could ju&s;t make out, that a Ru&s;&s;ian Captain had been murdered by the natives, and that the Ru&s;&s;ians had taken a &s;evere revenge, and had laid the coun|try under contribution, and obliged the inhabi|tants to pay a certain annual tribute in &s;kins; but to what extent they had &s;ubdued the country, or in what year, they could not at all under&s;tand. They learnt, that the name of the i&s;land was Noo-Oonala&s;hkah, in lat. 53.55. long. 167.30. E. of Greenwich; that they had another &s;ettlement to the Southward, and other ve&s;&s;els that were con|&s;tantly employed in trading with the natives, and collecting their &s;kins and oil; that the fac|tory was &s;uppo&s;ed to clear about 100,000 ru|bles annually by this trade; and that it was in|crea&s;ing; that their only guard con&s;i&s;ted of a|bout 40 Kam&s;hat&s;kadale Ru&s;&s;ians, and 300 na|tives, over whom they were obliged to keep a watchful eye. Our gentlemen's entertainment there was rather friendly than &s;umptuous; they had dried veni&s;on, dried &s;almon, and great variety of other fi&s;h, dre&s;&s;ed after the Ru&s;&s;ian manner; their bi&s;cuit was black, and their bread rye; their butter not extraordinary; their wine and brandy, the Indians who conducted the gentlemen earned, from the &s;hips, with which the Ru&s;&s;ian officers made very free. The evening; being &s;pent in mutual enquiries, by which neither &s;ide could receive much &s;atisfaction, they were &s;hewn to the apart|ments prepared for them, where they &s;lept un|di&s;turbed.
<PB N="277" REF="356">
In the morning they renewed their enquiries, and the Ru&s;&s;ians, by exhibiting the chart of their di&s;coveries and conque&s;ts, gave our gentlemen more &s;atisfactory information than they could otherwi&s;e have obtained. They ob&s;erved a remarkable conformity between tho&s;e charts ex|hibited by the Ru&s;&s;ians as far as they went, and their own. The Ru&s;&s;ian di&s;coveries extended from the 49th to the 64th degree of Northern latitude, by which the impracticability which we had di&s;covered of a North-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age by any &s;trait or &s;ound was fully confirmed.</P>
<P>They were now equally communicative to each other; the Ru&s;&s;ian gentlemen were de&s;irous of knowing the names of the navigators and &s;hips, with the expedition they were engaged in; and they were invited on board to receive further information. To this they readily agreed; and as &s;oon as our gentlemen had &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity; had vi&s;ited the Ru&s;&s;ian hou&s;es, which were built with timber, and tho&s;e of the natives built with poles and earth; had remarked the &s;implicity of the latter, which &s;eemed but one degree above the level of the beavers they hunt|ed; and of the former, that was little more than a degree above tho&s;e of the natives; they &s;et out upon their return to the &s;hips, accompanied by the Ru&s;&s;ian gentlemen, by whom they had been entertained.</P>
<P>About five in the evening, they all came on board the Re&s;olution: the Ru&s;&s;ian gentlemen were received by Capt. Cook with that fami|liarity and politene&s;s that was natural to him; they were taken into the great cabin, where both Captains with their principal officers and gen|tlemen were a&s;&s;embled to entertain them, and where the bottle was pretty bri&s;kly pu&s;hed about,
<PB N="278" REF="357">
as that was the principal &s;ubject in which the &s;trangers could bear a part. Here they were in|terrogated as to the time generally taken up in making the voyage to Kam&s;hat&s;ka, which they an&s;wered, by dividing the year into twelve parts, and pointing to the two middlemo&s;t. As the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el which lay at Aegooch&s;kach was of the company, he was a&s;ked at what time he expected to arrive at Kam&s;hat&s;ka. He an&s;wered about the 9th month, meaning in July. He was then reque&s;ted to take letters with him to be for|warded to England through Ru&s;&s;ia, &s;hould it &s;o happen that he &s;hould arrive at that port before us. This charge he readily undertook; and, being pretty well plied with liquor, they &s;lept on board the Re&s;olution, and next day came on board the Di&s;covery, where they dined, and, be|ing amply &s;upplied with grog, went jovially away in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Before our departure, we were vi&s;ited by the Principal of the Ru&s;&s;ian factory, who&s;e name was Era&s;im Gergorioffzin Izmyloff. He came from the Southward, accompanied by a number of In|dian canoes, laden with &s;kins, who on coming a&s;hore in the harbour, in&s;tantly began erecting a tent, which in half an hour they fini&s;hed, cover|ing it with &s;kins. He was received on board the Re&s;olution with the re&s;pect due to his rank; and by his deportment it was ea&s;y to perceive that he was of family. He was a young gentleman of a fair complexion, and graceful &s;tature, and, though differing but little in point of dre&s;s from tho&s;e by whom we had been vi&s;ited before, he was, not|with&s;tanding, very different in his manners and behaviour. He had travelled much, but chiefly in the&s;e &s;avage countries, and in the Northern parts of A&s;ia, and under&s;tood, and could talk the
<PB N="279" REF="358">
language of the natives, but could &s;peak no European language, except his own. He was hand&s;omely entertained on board both &s;hips, and had every attention paid him that, in our &s;itua|tion, he had rea&s;on to expect; nor was he in&s;en|&s;ible of our civilities. He wrote a letter, directed to the Governor of Kam&s;hat&s;ka, which he re|que&s;ted Capt. Cook to deliver. It contained, as we afterwards under&s;tood, a detail of his own mercantile affairs, and a repre&s;entation of us, as trading with the Indians. He told us, that his re&s;idence was on the coa&s;t, off which he had re|ceived a note in a little box, and that he was the per&s;on who wrote that note and &s;ent it. Some pre&s;ents reciprocally pa&s;&s;ed: tho&s;e on his part were cloaks and &s;kins; on ours, tobacco and &s;pirituous liquors, of both which we ob&s;erved the Ru&s;&s;ians to be immoderately fond.</P>
<P>After &s;leeping on board the &s;hips two nights, and ob&s;erving, with an attentive eye, the diffe|rent employments of the artificers, and examin|ing the various conveniencies and accommoda|tions which we had on board, he took his leave on the 26th, intending to make &s;ome &s;tay at the &s;ettlement of Egoo&s;chac, which the gentlemen of the Re&s;olution had ju&s;t vi&s;ited.</P>
<P>From this gentleman Capt. Cook received much u&s;eful information. He had &s;ome excel|lent maps and charts of the Northern coa&s;ts and i&s;lands, which never had been publi&s;hed, but which had every mark of authenticity. He &s;aid, there were only two harbours on the penin&s;ula of Kamt&s;chatka that were fit to receive &s;hips of burden; the bay of Awat&s;ka and the river Oluto|ra: as to the many i&s;lands to the North of Kamt|&s;chatka, lying between that and the coa&s;ts of America, which had found place in former maps,
<PB N="280" REF="359">
were wholly omitted and others added, by which the Captain was enabled to compleat his own. From the information given by this gentleman, we have been able to correct our own map pre|fixed to this voyage, with re&s;pect to the &s;ituation of i&s;lands between the Bay of Awat&s;ka, and the country of Ala&s;cha, the name by which the con|tinent of this part of America is known to the Ru&s;&s;ians, and called by the natives.</P>
<P>There are, it &s;eems, Ru&s;&s;ians &s;ettled on all the principal i&s;lands between Oonala&s;hka and Kamt|&s;chatka, for the purpo&s;e of collecting furs. Their great object is the &s;ea-beaver or otter. The na|tives are a quiet inoffen&s;ive people, and for ho|ne&s;ty might &s;erve as an example to the mo&s;t en|lightened people upon earth. The latitude of Saganoodha harbour is 53.5. longitude 193.11.</P>
<P>On the 25th, the repairs of both &s;hips being compleated, and the wind coming fair to the Southward, we unmoored and were preparing to &s;ail, when the Re&s;olution, on clearing the harbour, run upon a rock, and, it was feared, had re|ceived much damage, as at low water &s;he &s;wayed 13 inches, and it was twelve at night before &s;he was di&s;engaged. This nece&s;&s;arily retarded our de|parture; and happily it was that we were got &s;afe into harbour, for a &s;torm aro&s;e, which tumbled the waters into the race with unexampled fury.</P>
<P>On the 26th, the wind abated and came fair to carry us to &s;ea, and the &s;hip being found unhurt, we weighed, and, having cleared the harbour, made &s;ail, directing our cour&s;e up the race, to the N. W. At eight o'clock we were out of the race, but &s;till continued our cour&s;e to the We&s;t|ward, when at midnight a heavy gale came on attended with &s;now and rain.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="360">On the 27th, the gale &s;till continuing, to add to our labour, we &s;prung a leak, which kept us to the pumps till the &s;torm abated. While it was at the height, it carried away our fore and main|tacks, and, in endeavouring to &s;ave them, John Mackinto&s;h, &s;eaman, was &s;truck dead, and the boat&s;wain and four men were much wounded.</P>
<P>On the 28th, having lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olu|tion in the heavy gale, about three in the morn|ing we heard her &s;ignal for wearing. Lat. 53.52.</P>
<P>On the 29th, about eight A. M. we again &s;aw land, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the i&s;land called Amogh|ta, and by ten were in danger of peri&s;hing on a lee-&s;hore. At eleven our people in taking in a reef of the fore-top-&s;ail, called out a &s;hip under &s;ail, bearing N. N. W. but on a nearer view found it an elevated rock covered with &s;now. Lat. 53.57. long. 191.192.</P>
<P>On the 30th, we were again within the race, and at &s;ix in the evening pa&s;&s;ed the entrance of our harbour, when five canoes made towards us; but being now in full &s;ail, intending to leave the coa&s;t, our leak not being found dangerous, they were unable to overtake us, nor did we think it of con&s;equence to lie bye till they &s;hould come up.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e to the Southward. Lat. 52.3.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of November, we once more &s;tood to the Southward, after which no accident, or any thing worth relating happened, till our ar|rival on the coa&s;t of O-why-e, &s;o called by the Ru&s;&s;ians, and by Capt. Cook Providence harbour, except that on the 7th a cormorant was &s;een to fly &s;everal times round the Re&s;olution; which was the more noticed as tho&s;e birds are never &s;een far from land, and none was near.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="361">On the 26th, being then in lat. 21.15. about &s;ix A. M. we came in &s;ight of land, bearing from S. S. W. to N. W. very high and beau|tiful; we were then &s;o much in want of provi|&s;ions, that Capt. Clerke, much again&s;t his in|clination, was under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;titut|ing &s;tock-fi&s;h in the room of beef; but we were no &s;ooner well in with the land, than we were vi&s;ited by many of the inhabitants, who came off with their canoes with all &s;orts of provi&s;ions which their i&s;land afforded; and every man on board, had leave to purcha&s;e what he could for his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. This diffu&s;ed a joy among the mariners that is not ea&s;y to be expre&s;&s;ed. From a &s;ullenne&s;s and di&s;content vi&s;ible in every countenance the day before, all was chearfulne&s;s, mirth and jollity. Fre&s;h provi&s;ions and kind dam&s;els are the &s;ailors &s;ole delight; and when in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e, pa&s;t hard&s;hips are in&s;tantly forgotten: even tho&s;e whom the &s;curvy had at|tacked, and had rendered pale and lifele&s;s as gho&s;ts, brightened upon this occa&s;ion, and for the moment appeared alert. This flattering beginning, however, yielded no &s;ub&s;tantial re|lief. The boats that were &s;ent to &s;ound the &s;hore, and to look for a harbour, went out day after day, without being able to di&s;cover &s;o much as a &s;afe anchorage, and we were longer in finding a harbour than in making the coa&s;t. Nothing could be more toil&s;ome or di&s;tre&s;&s;ing than our pre&s;ent &s;ituation; within &s;ight of land, yet unable to reach it; driven out to &s;ea, by one &s;torm, and in danger of being wrecked on the breakers by another. At length, after having examined the leeward &s;ide of the i&s;land, Captain Cook made the &s;ignal to &s;tand out to &s;ea. This was on the 7th of December, when it was de|termined
<PB N="283" REF="362">
to take a long &s;tretch, in order, if po&s;|&s;ible, to get round the S. E. extremity, and to ex|amine the weathermo&s;t &s;ide, where we were told there was a &s;afe harbour. In this attempt we &s;plit our main-top-ma&s;t-&s;tay-&s;ail, and lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olution. The weather continuing tem|pe&s;tuous for many days, heavy complaints again prevailed among the &s;hip's company. Their &s;ufferings, from ince&s;&s;ant labour and &s;canty provi&s;ions, were grown confe&s;&s;edly grievous. Their grog, that had been &s;topped as &s;oon as we arrived upon the coa&s;t, was again dealt out to them as u&s;ual; and it was with the kinde&s;t treatment from their officers, that the men could be kept to their duty; yet on Chri&s;tmas-day, when each man was allowed a pint of brandy, and free leave to enjoy him&s;elf as he liked, not a murmur was heard; they the very next day returned to bu&s;ine&s;s, and continued it without repining, till</P>
<P>The 16th of January, 1779, when, after a &s;eries of the mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous weather that ever happened in that climate, the boats from both &s;hips were &s;ent out to examine a fine bay, where we were informed there was a harbour in which we might &s;afely moor, and where we &s;hould be &s;upplied with materials to refit the &s;hips, and provi&s;ions to victual them. In the evening the boats returned with the joyful news, that they had &s;ucceeded in their &s;earch, and that the har|bour promi&s;ed fair to an&s;wer all that had been &s;aid of it.</P>
<P>On the 17th our boats were employed in towing the &s;hips into harbour in &s;ight of the greate&s;t multitude of Indian &s;pectators in canoes and on &s;hore, that we had ever &s;een a&s;&s;embled to|gether in any part of our voyage. It was con|cluded,
<PB N="284" REF="363">
that their number could not be le&s;s than 2 or 3000. While we were hovering upon the coa&s;t, we had often been vi&s;ited by 200 canoes at a time, who came to trade, and who brought us provi&s;ions when the weather would permit; and, be&s;ides provi&s;ions, they brought us great quantities of cordage, &s;alt, and other manufactures of the i&s;land, which the Captains purcha&s;ed for the u&s;e of the &s;hips, and without which we could not have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; for during the tempe&s;tuous weather our cordage &s;napped rope after rope, &s;o that our &s;pare hands were ince&s;&s;antly employed, night and day, in knotting and &s;plicing, of which there was no end.</P>
<P>This day, before two o'clock, P. M. we were &s;afely moored in 17 fathom water, in company with the Re&s;olution, which a few days before we had given over for lo&s;t. From the time of at|tempting to get round the i&s;land, till the 8th of January, we had never been able to get &s;ight of her, though both &s;hips were con&s;tantly looking out to find each other. They had &s;uffered much in their ma&s;ts and rigging, and were happy at la&s;t, as well as our&s;elves, to find a convenient harbour to refit. We were &s;carce moored, when a young man, of maje&s;tic appearance, came along &s;ide, and after an oration, and the u&s;ual ceremonies of peace had pa&s;&s;sed on both &s;ides, he came on board, bring|ing with him a &s;mall barbecued hog, &s;ome ready-dre&s;&s;ed bread-fruit, and a curious mantle of red cloth, as pre&s;ents to the Captain; and in return was complimented with &s;everal axes, looking-gla&s;&s;es, bracelets, and other &s;hewy articles that attracted his notice. While he was bu&s;y in ad|miring every thing he &s;aw on board the Di&s;covery, the pinnace was ordered out, and he with his at|tendants were taken to Capt. Cook, where he
<PB N="285" REF="364">
found another Chief, of a &s;till more graceful a&s;|pect, named Kaneena. All the&s;e were received with all po&s;&s;ible re&s;pect. In the mean time came in another Chief, named Koah, who was &s;oon di&s;|covered to be a prie&s;t; but who, in his youth, had been a di&s;tingui&s;hed warrior. After entertaining them with mu&s;ic, and inviting them to partake of &s;uch refre&s;hments as the &s;hip afforded, and mak|ing them &s;ome hand&s;ome pre&s;ents, the Captain acquainted them with his wants, by &s;hewing them the condition of his &s;hip, and reque&s;ting a &s;mall portion of ground to land his materials, and to erect his tents. This reque&s;t was readily granted, at the &s;ame time giving the Captain to under&s;tand, that the great King was ab&s;ent, that he had lately been at war with the King of the neighbouring i&s;land of Maw-whee, that he was employed in &s;et|tling the terms of peace, and that in le&s;s than ten days he was expected home. That they might, notwith&s;tanding, land whatever they thought fit; and that the ground they had occa&s;ion for &s;hould be marked out and taboo'd, that is, appropriated to their u&s;e, without any of the natives being per|mitted to encroach upon it. Both Captains very readily embraced the offer, and prepared to ac|company their benefactors to the town near which they wi&s;hed to pitch their tents. Upon their land|ing, &s;everal vacant plats of ground were &s;hewn them, and, when they had made their choice, &s;takes were ordered to be driven at certain di&s;|tances, and a line to be carried round, within which the common people were forbidden to en|ter, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties. Matters being thus amicably &s;ettled, no time was lo&s;t on our part to get every thing on &s;hore. The tents, the armourer's forge, the ma&s;ts, the &s;ails, the rigging, the water-ca&s;ks, the bread, the flour, the powder,
<PB N="286" REF="365">
in &s;hort, every article that wanted either to be re|viewed or repaired were &s;ent on &s;hore; and not the lea&s;t interruption was given to the boats em|ployed in the carriage, or in&s;ult offered to the per&s;ons who conducted them. On the contrary, the Chiefs offered &s;ome empty hou&s;es, that were conveniently &s;ituated near the new dock (if that may be &s;o termed where our artificers were &s;et to work) for the &s;ick to lodge till their recovery. No &s;trangers were ever more ho&s;pitably received.</P>
<P>On the morning after our people landed, &s;ix large double canoes were &s;een entering the har|bour at a great rate, having not le&s;s than 30 pad|dles to each canoe, with upwards of 60 Indians on board, mo&s;t of them naked. Seeing them on their nearer approach making towards the &s;hips, the Captains ordered the guns to be &s;hotted, the marines to be drawn up, and every man to be ready at his po&s;t; the Indians a&s;&s;embled &s;o fa&s;t, that before noon, the &s;hips were &s;urrounded with more than 100 canoes, in which there were not le&s;s than 1000 Indians. They at fir&s;t traded friendly, having hogs in abundance, and plenty of bread-fruit, plantains, bananoes, and whatever el&s;e the i&s;land produced; but they had not been there long, before a large &s;tone was thrown in at the cabin-window of the Di&s;covery, by an invi&s;ible hand. A watch was in&s;tantly &s;et, and in le&s;s than half an hour another &s;tone was thrown at the caulkers, as they were at work on a &s;tage on the &s;hip's &s;ide. The offender was &s;een, and in &s;ight of the Chiefs, and the whole multitude, he was &s;eized, brought on board, tied to the &s;hrouds, and puni&s;hed with fifty la&s;hes. In a few minutes, &s;uch was their fright, there was not an Indian to be &s;een near the &s;hips.&mdash;Like unlucky boys, when one is apprehended for &s;ome naughty trick, the re&s;t
<PB N="287" REF="366">
commonly fly the place.&mdash;And in fact, the&s;e peo|ple are in many re&s;pects like children, and in none more than in this in&s;tance. Before the day clo&s;ed, they all again returned to trade, and, when night approached, not a male was to be &s;een; but &s;warms of females, who came to &s;leep on board, though much again&s;t the will of Capt. Cook, who, upon the fir&s;t arrival of the &s;hips upon the coa&s;t, wi&s;hed to have prohibited all commerce with the women of the i&s;land; but he &s;oon found, that if that commerce was forbidden, all other trade mu&s;t cea&s;e of cour&s;e, for not a pig could be purcha&s;ed, unle&s;s a girl was permitted to bring it to market.</P>
<P>There are who have blamed Capt. Cook for his &s;everity to the Indians; but it was not to the In|dians alone that he was &s;evere in his di&s;cipline. He never &s;uffered any fault in his own people, though ever &s;o trivial, to e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed. If they were charged with in&s;ulting an Indian, or injuring him in his property, if the fact was proved, the offender was &s;urely puni&s;hed in &s;ight of the Indians. By this impartial di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, the Indians them&s;elves conceived &s;o high an idea of his wi&s;dom, and his power too, that they paid him the &s;ame honours as they did their Et-u-a, or Good Spirit.</P>
<P>The caulkers, who have already been men|tioned, when they came round in cour&s;e to the after-part of the Re&s;olution, found that, be&s;ides the &s;eams that wanted clo&s;ing, there were other more material defects. The rudder's eyes were almo&s;t eaten through with ru&s;t, and the bolts ready to tumble out. This was an alarming defect; and all other bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;u&s;pended till that was re|paired.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="367">Every thing went on now as &s;moothly as could be wi&s;hed. The Chiefs, if they &s;aw any of their own people mi&s;behave, would them&s;elves give in|formation, and bring them to puni&s;hment; they were &s;o very obliging, that, &s;eeing us in want of wood to burn, they made an offer of a high fence, that &s;urrounded the Morai, adjoining to the town, for a pre&s;ent &s;upply.</P>
<P>On the 19th, being the fourth day after our ar|rival, &s;everal very large canoes were &s;een to come from the S. E. We at fir&s;t thought they were the friends with whom we had traded on the other &s;ide of the i&s;land; but on their nearer approach, we found they were all armed and clothed in the military uniform, after their country manner. This gave us cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome traiterous de|&s;ign, but our fears were in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;&s;ipated by the a&s;&s;urances we received from our friends on board, that they were &s;ome of the warriors that had accompanied the King in his expedition again&s;t the Eree of Maw-wee, and that they were now returning home in triumph; but, notwith|&s;tanding this a&s;&s;urance, it was thought prudent to be upon our guard, and the rather as the women who were on board, told us, that their people de|&s;igned to attack us, and to mattee, that is, to kill us every one.</P>
<P>Next day, before nine in the morning, more than a thou&s;and Indians &s;urrounded the Di&s;covery, in&s;omuch that pre&s;&s;ing their weight chiefly on one &s;ide, the &s;hip was in danger of being over-&s;et. The Captain ordered two great guns to be fired, in order to try what effect that would have in di&s;|per&s;ing them. In le&s;s than three minutes, there were a thou&s;and heads to be &s;een above water, &s;o many having jumped into the &s;ea, frighted on the &s;udden report of the guns; neither did a &s;ingle canoe come near us all the next day. Some of the
<PB N="289" REF="368">
women however remained on board, who never could be prevailed on to &s;hew them&s;elves upon deck in the day-time; but whether from fear of their own people, or of the great guns, we never could learn. As all trade was now &s;topt, and no|thing brought on board for our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, Capt. Cook went on &s;hore to expo&s;tulate with the Chiefs, and by &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents to engage them to trade as before; threatening at the &s;ame time to lay their towns wa&s;te, if they refu&s;ed to &s;upply the &s;hips with the provi&s;ions they &s;tood in need of. His remon&s;trances had the de&s;ired effect, and next day we purcha&s;ed not le&s;s than 60 large hogs, with great quantities of fruits and vegetables for the &s;hips u&s;e.</P>
<P>In a few days after this, the old King Terreeoboo was &s;een to enter the harbour, on his return from Maw-wee. In the afternoon he vi&s;ited the &s;hip in a private manner, attended only by one canoe, in which were his wife and children. He &s;taid on board till near ten at night, when he returned to the village Kowrowa.</P>
<P>The next day about noon, the King, in a large canoe, attended by two others, &s;et out from the village, and paddled towards the &s;hips, in great &s;tate. Their appearance was grand and magni|ficent. In the fir&s;t canoe was Terreeoboo, and his Chiefs, dre&s;&s;ed in their feathered cloaks and helmets, and armed with long &s;pears and daggers. In the &s;econd, came the venerable Kaoo, the Chief of the Prie&s;ts, and his brethren, with their idols di&s;|played on red cloth. The&s;e idols were bu&s;ts of a gi|gantic &s;ize, made of wicker-work, and curiou&s;ly co|vered with &s;mall feathers of various colours, wrought in the &s;ame manner with their cloaks. Their eyes were made of large pearl oy&s;ters, with a black nut fixed in the centre; their mouths were &s;et with a
<PB N="290" REF="369">
double row of the fangs of dogs; and together, with the re&s;t of their features, were &s;trangely di&s;|torted. The third canoe was filled with hogs, and various &s;orts of vegetables. As they went along, the Prie&s;ts, in the centre canoe, &s;ung their hymns with great &s;olemnity; and after paddling round the &s;hips, in&s;tead of going on board as was ex|pected, they made towards the &s;hore, at the beach where our men were &s;tationed. On their approach, the guard was in&s;tantly ordered out to receive the King; and Capt. Cook, perceiving he was going on &s;hore, followed him, and arrived nearly at the &s;ame time. They were conducted into the tent, where they had &s;carce been &s;eated, when the King ro&s;e up, and, in a very graceful manner, threw over the Captain's &s;houlders, the cloak he him|&s;elf wore, put a feathered helmet upon his head, and a curious fan in his hand. He al&s;o &s;pread at his feet five or &s;ix other cloaks, all exceedingly beautiful, and of great value. His attendants then brought four very large hogs, with &s;ugar-canes, cocoa-nuts, and bread fruit. This part of the ceremony over, they all made a circle round with their images in proce&s;&s;ion, till they arrived at their Morai, where they placed their deities, and depo&s;ited their arms.</P>
<P>Next day both Captains, accompanied with &s;e|veral of their officers, went to pay the King a vi|&s;it on &s;hore. They were very re&s;pectfully received, and having dined after the Indian manner, the King ro&s;e, and clothing Capt. Cook with a man|tle, &s;uch as is worn by the great Oreno in grand proce&s;&s;ion, he was conducted to the morai, or place of wor&s;hip, where a garland of green plan|tain leaves was put upon his head, and he was &s;eated on a kind of throne, and had the honour of exchanging names with the King, the &s;tronge&s;t
<PB N="291" REF="370">
pledge of friend&s;hip the&s;e i&s;landers can confer. He was now addre&s;&s;ed in a long oration by a prie&s;t clothed in a ve&s;tment of party-coloured cloth, who concluded the &s;olemnity with a choral hymn, in which he was joined by all the prie&s;ts pre&s;ent; who had no &s;ooner fini&s;hed their &s;ong than they all fell at his feet, the King acquainting him, that this was now his building, and that he was from henceforth their Orono. From this time an Indian Prie&s;t was, by the King's order, placed at the head of his pinnace, at who&s;e approach the Indians in their canoes, as he pa&s;&s;ed them, pro&s;trated them&s;elves till he was out of &s;ight; and this they did when the Captain was alone: but the Prie&s;ts had orders from the King, whenever the Captain came a&s;hore in his pinnace, to attend him, and conduct him to his hou&s;e, which the &s;ailors now called Cook's Altar.</P>
<P>When all the&s;e &s;olemnities were over, we were not a little a&s;toni&s;hed to find in this King, the &s;ame infirm, emaciated, old man, that came on board Capt. Cook when off the i&s;land of Ma-wee; and it was &s;oon di&s;covered, that he was then ac|companied with the &s;ame per&s;ons, viz. his two younger &s;ons, one &s;ixteen, the other twelve, with his nephew Maiha-Macha, a man of a mo&s;t &s;avage countenance.</P>
<P>[When we fir&s;t approached the coa&s;t of this i&s;land of O why hee, we were a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight of a mountain of a &s;tupendous height, who&s;e head was covered with &s;now. This was &s;o rare a &s;ight in an i&s;land between the tropics, that &s;everal of the officers and gentlemen from both &s;hips were de&s;irous of taking a nearer view of it; and for that purpo&s;e they reque&s;ted the King's permi&s;&s;ion, and a guide to attend them, which was readily granted,
<PB N="292" REF="371">
and no le&s;s than ten Indians contended which &s;hould accompany them.]</P>
<P>On the 26th Mr. Nel&s;on, our botani&s;t, and four other gentlemen &s;et out in the morning on this expedition, which they afterwards found attended with no &s;mall fatigue, and not a little danger; for after travelling two days and two nights, and ex|periencing the greate&s;t fatigue and hard&s;hips; no water, no paths to direct their way; no inhabitants for many miles, and the cold exce&s;&s;ive as they approached the mountain, which &s;eemed covered with &s;now, they were glad to get back without any accident. In the cour&s;e of their journey, they were directed to the cottage of an old hermit, who, they &s;aid, had formerly been a great war|rior; but who, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, had retired to this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot. He received them with|out any kind of emotion, but would accept of no|thing that they offered him. He appeared by far the olde&s;t man they had &s;een on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 29th they returned to the &s;hips, and the only advantage that accrued from their journey, was, a curious a&s;&s;ortment of indigenous plants and &s;ome natural curio&s;ities, collected by Mr. Nel&s;on. During their ab&s;ence every thing remained quiet at the tents, and the Indians &s;upplied the &s;hips with &s;uch quantities of provi&s;ions of all kinds, that orders were given to purcha&s;e no more hogs in one day than could be killed, &s;alted, and &s;towed away the next day. This order was in con&s;e|quence of a former order, to purcha&s;e all that could be procured for &s;ea-&s;tock; by which &s;o many were brought on board, that &s;everal of them died be|fore they could be properly di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>It had been generally thought impracticable to cure the fle&s;h of the&s;e animals in the tropical cli|mates; and it is believed, that few trials had ever
<PB N="293" REF="372">
been made before tho&s;e of Capt. Cook. In his fir&s;t voyage in 1774, he fir&s;t made the attempt, but not very &s;ucce&s;sfully. But it was now be|come ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, either to perfect the di&s;covery, or relinqui&s;h the voyage.</P>
<P>The method we took was always to &s;laughter them in the afternoon, and as &s;oon as the hair was &s;calded off, and the entrails removed, the carca&s;s was divided into pieces, from four to eight pounds each, and the bones of the chine and legs taken out, and, in the large &s;ort, the ribs al&s;o. Every piece being then carefully wiped and examined, that no brui&s;e might e&s;cape, and all the veins cleared out, that no coagulated blood might re|main, they were then handed to the &s;alters while the fle&s;h was &s;till warm. After they had been well rubbed with &s;alt, they were then placed in a heap on a &s;tage, rai&s;ed in the open air, covered with planks, and pre&s;&s;ed with the heavie&s;t weights we could lay on them. In this &s;ituation they lay till the next evening, when they were again well wiped and examined, and the &s;u&s;picious parts taken away. They were then put into a tub of &s;trong pickle, where they were always looked over once or twice a day, and if any piece had not taken &s;alt, which was readily di&s;covered by the &s;mell, they were immediately taken out, re-examined, and the &s;ound pieces put to fre&s;h pickle, and the other either u&s;ed immediately, or thrown away. This, however, &s;eldom happened. After &s;ix days, they were taken out, examined for the la&s;t time, and being again lightly pre&s;&s;ed, they were packed in barrels with a thin layer of &s;alt between them. Some of this pork was brought to England, per|fectly &s;weet and good.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of February, 1779, William Wat|man, gunner's mate, died. His body in the af|ternoon was carried on &s;hore in the pinnace, and
<PB N="294" REF="373">
buried, according to his own de&s;ire, in the Morai belonging to the King. The Indians who dug his grave about four feet deep, covered the bottom of it with green leaves; and when the corp&s;e was de|po&s;ited in the earth, the Chiefs who attended the funeral, put a barbecued hog at the head, and another at the feet, with a quantity of bread-fruit, plantains and bananas. More was going to be added, when Capt. Cook ordered the grave to be covered up, and a po&s;t erected to the memory of the decea&s;ed, in&s;cribed with his name, the date of the year, day of his death, and the nation to which he belonged. From this circum&s;tance, Capt. Cook gave this port the name of Watman's Harbour. The next day the Indians rolled large &s;tones over his grave, and brought two barbecued hogs, plantains and bananas, cocoa-nuts, and bread-fruit, which they placed over his grave, upon a &s;tage erected for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We were now preparing to depart, when our Captain was pre&s;ented by the King with twelve large hogs, three boats-load of bread-fruit, pota|toes, &s;ugar-cane, and cocoa-nuts; and the &s;ame pre&s;ent was made to Capt. Cook.</P>
<P>This day, Feb. 2, the King came on board, attended with twenty of his Chiefs, and gave the Captains of both &s;hips, with their officers, an in|vitation to an heiva, in which many of the prin|cipal Chiefs were to be performers. Capt. Clerke excu&s;ed him&s;elf from ill health; but Capt. Cook and the other Gentlemen promi&s;ed to attend.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day the King and his Chiefs dined on board the Re&s;olution, and were entertained with mu&s;ic, the whole band having orders to play all the while they &s;at at dinner. They were highly delighted with the mu&s;ic, and would not &s;uffer the performers to re&s;t a moment.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="374">About four in the afternoon, the pinnaces from both &s;hips were ordered to be in readine&s;s to take the company a&s;hore, with their pendants and co|lours di&s;played, to do honour to a king and peo|ple, by whom we had been &s;o ho&s;pitably enter|tained. More than 200 canoes attended us to &s;hore, where a number of Chiefs were ready to receive us, who ail ob&s;erved a profound &s;ilence at our landing, and conducted us to the place ap|pointed for the entertainment. But we were much di&s;appointed by the performers, who were far in|ferior to tho&s;e of the Southern i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The only part of the performance that was to|lerable, was their &s;inging, with which the heiva or play concluded; the young prince&s;&s;es, the chiefs, and even the king him&s;elf joining in the chorus.</P>
<P>The play being ended, Capt. Cook acquainted the King that, with his permi&s;&s;ion, he would ex|hibit &s;ome fire-works, that, if they did not frighten, would very much a&s;toni&s;h his people. The King very readily gave his con&s;ent; and the engineer was ordered to begin his exhibition as &s;oon as it was dark. On the ri&s;ing of the fir&s;t &s;ky-rocket, the Indians fled precipitately, and hid them&s;elves in the hou&s;es, or wherever they could find any &s;helter; at fir&s;t there were &s;ome thou&s;and &s;pectators; but in le&s;s than ten minutes there were not fifty to be &s;een, the King and his attendants excepted, whom the Captain and the gentlemen with the greate&s;t difficulty per&s;uaded to &s;tay. When the &s;econd ro&s;e up in the air, lamentations were heard from every quarter; and when the water-rockets were played off, the King and his Chiefs were hardly to be re&s;trained. Other fire-works it was found dangerous to exhibit, as the&s;e had already &s;truck the &s;pectators, the King as well as his people, with a general panic. We therefore took leave of
<PB N="296" REF="375">
the King and Royal family, and returned on board our re&s;pective &s;hips. The King having been made to under&s;tand that we &s;hould &s;ail the fir&s;t fair wind, came next morning to vi&s;it the Captains of both &s;hips, who were now preparing to &s;ail. This being publicly known, the Indians in general expre&s;&s;ed their concern, but particu|larly the young women, who&s;e lamentations were heard from every quarter.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 4th of February, all hands were mu&s;tered, and none were mi&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 5th, we cleared the har|bour, &s;haping our cour&s;e for Maw-wee, as we had been informed by the King, that in that i&s;land there was a fine harbour and excellent water. We had not been long under &s;ail, when the King, who had omitted to take his leave of our Captain in the morning, as not &s;u&s;pecting our departure &s;o &s;udden, came after the &s;hips, accompanied by the young prince, his &s;on, in a &s;ailing canoe, bringing with them ten large hogs, a great number of fowls, and a &s;mall turtle (a great rarity) with bread-fruit in abundance. They al&s;o brought with them great quantities of cocoa-nuts, plan|tains, and &s;ugar-canes.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides other per&s;ons of condition who acom|panied the King, there was an old prie&s;t, Kaoa, who had always &s;hewn a particular attachment to Capt. Clerke, and who had not been unrewarded for his civility. It being rather late when they reached the &s;hips, they &s;taid on board but a few hours, and then all departed except the old prie&s;t and &s;ome girls, who by the King's permi&s;&s;ion were &s;uffered to remain on board till they &s;hould arrive at &s;ome of the neighbouring i&s;les. We were now &s;teering with a fine breeze, but ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of the evening, to our great mortifica|tion,
<PB N="297" REF="376">
the wind died away, and a great &s;well &s;uc|ceeding, with a &s;trong current &s;etting right in for the &s;hore, we were in the utmo&s;t danger of being driven upon the rocks. In the height of our di&s;|tre&s;s and trouble, the old prie&s;t, who had been &s;uffered to &s;leep in the great cabin, leapt over|board un&s;een, with a piece of &s;ilk, the Captain's property, and &s;wam to &s;hore.</P>
<P>The next day, &s;eeing a large canoe between us and the &s;hore, we hove-to for her coming up, and to our great &s;urprize perceived the old King, accompanied by &s;everal of his Chiefs, having in their ve&s;&s;el the prie&s;t who had &s;tolen the &s;ilk, whom the King delivered to the Captain, at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting that his fault might be for|given. The King being told that his reque&s;t was granted, unbound him, and &s;et him at liberty; telling the Captain that, &s;eeing him with the &s;ilk, he judged it was none of his own, and therefore ordered him to be apprehended; and had taken this method of expo&s;ing him for injuring his friend. This &s;ingular in&s;tance of Indian genero&s;ity and ju&s;tice, ought not to be forgotten. It appears, however, that this old prie&s;t, who had changed names, and was proud of being called <HI>Bretanne,</HI> had &s;lipt away from Mr. Bligh, ma&s;ter of the Re|&s;olution, to whom he had pretended to di&s;cover a much more commodious harbour, than that of Kakooa, which they had ju&s;t left. As &s;oon as they had delivered the &s;ilk, which the Captain would have had the King to accept, they departed, and had &s;carce reached the &s;hore, when a heavy gale came on, with thunder, lightning, and hard rain. We wore &s;hip, and continued working off the land all night, and &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;o|lution, who, as well as the Di&s;covery, continued bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ing about the i&s;land &s;even days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in
<PB N="298" REF="377">
dread every moment of being wrecked upon the coa&s;t. On the fourth day, after we had lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olution, the &s;torm being a little abated, we ob&s;erved her under a high part of the i&s;land, lying with her fore-top-gallant-ma&s;t down, her fore-top-&s;ail-yard upon the cap, and the &s;ail furled, which gave us rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;ome acci|dent had befallen her; and as we expected, &s;o we found it. We &s;tood down for her with a heavy gale; but it was not till next day that we could come to &s;peak with her. Capt. Cook him&s;elf be|ing upon deck when we came up, informed us that he had &s;prung his fore-ma&s;t in two different places; that the &s;hip was leaky, and that it was with the greate&s;t difficulty they kept her above water. He further &s;aid, that on the 7th in the morning they di&s;covered the leak; that at that time they made thirty inches of water in three hours; and that ever &s;ince all hands had been con&s;tantly employed night and day in baling and pumping; we likewi&s;e under&s;tood, that they had &s;plit their main-top-&s;ail, and that they were now bound to our late harbour to repair their damage. We pur&s;ued the &s;ame cour&s;e; but it was not till the 11th, when we opened on the bay in which lay our port. We were very &s;oon &s;urrounded with our old friends, who brought us hogs, bread-fruit, plantains, bananoes, and cocoa-nuts, which they threw on board, without waiting for any re|compen&s;e. We were likewi&s;e vi&s;ited by the old King, the Prince, and many of the Chiefs, who came to welcome us, and who were &s;eemingly glad of our return. About ten in the morning, both &s;hips moored near their old birth, and pre|&s;ently all hands were &s;et to work to &s;trip the ma&s;t, and to carry it on &s;hore to be repaired.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="378">The next day the King came again on board, and mutual pre&s;ents and mutual civilities were continued as u&s;ual: but about five in the after|noon, there came along-&s;ide a large canoe, with about 60 of their fighting men, all armed, with little or no provi&s;ions on board, and who &s;eemed to have no good de&s;ign. Our Captain ob&s;erving their motions, ordered the guns to be &s;hotted, and every man to his po&s;t. About &s;ix, they departed, without offering the lea&s;t in&s;ult; but &s;oon after we &s;aw, upon a high hill, a large body a&s;&s;embled, who were ob&s;erved to be gathering &s;tones, and laying them in heaps. At dark they were &s;een to di&s;per&s;e; but great lights and fires were kept burning all night.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 13th, they again a&s;&s;em|bled, and began rolling the &s;tones from the brink of the hill, in order, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, to divert our attention, but which rather &s;erved to awaken our fears. Our Captains looking upon this as an in&s;ult, ordered the guns to be levelled, and fired among them, and in ten minutes there was not an Indian to be &s;een near the place.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the King came on board the Re&s;olution, and complained to Capt. Cook of our killing two of his people, intimating at the &s;ame time, that they had not the lea&s;t intention of hurt|ing us. He continued on board &s;ome hours, amu&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;eeing the armourers at work; and when he departed, reque&s;ted that they might be permitted to make him a Pahoo-a, (an in&s;trument they u&s;e in battle when they come to clo&s;e quarters) which was readily granted.</P>
<P>From this time forward the natives became very tumultuous and unruly, and &s;tole every thing they could lay their hands on, with any tolerable chance of e&s;caping. They were fired upon, but
<PB N="300" REF="379">
that only enraged them. One who had ju&s;t &s;tolen the armourer's tongs and an iron chi&s;el, with both which he was making to &s;hore, was intercepted by Capt. Cook him&s;elf, who, with a few marines, endeavoured to &s;eize him as he was landing; but the Indians &s;eeing his de&s;ign, came ru&s;hing in a body to the water-&s;ide, among whom the fellow found means to &s;ecrete him&s;elf; and the multi|tude, in&s;tead of delivering him up, attacked the boats that were in pur&s;uit of him, &s;eized their oars, broke them, and forced our whole party to retreat.</P>
<P>Capt. Cook having only a few marines with him, part of tho&s;e who were placed as a guard to the carpenters employed upon the ma&s;t, did not think proper to renew the attack; but returned to the tents, ordering a &s;trict watch to be kept during the night, and his whole force to be kept under arms till the matter &s;hould be accommo|dated. For this purpo&s;e, Mr. Edgar, our ma&s;ter, was &s;ent with a me&s;&s;age to the young prince, who from the beginning had behaved friendly, to ac|quaint him with the cau&s;e of the fray, and to de|mand the delinquent to be delivered up. The prince, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to his remon&s;trances, a&s;&s;umed another countenance, and Mr. Edgar was very roughly handled, and glad to make his e&s;cape with a &s;ound beating.</P>
<P>The temper of the Indians was now totally changed, and they became every day more and more trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>On the 14th, a va&s;t multitude of them were &s;een together, making great lamentation, and moving &s;lowly along to the beating of a drum, that &s;carce gave a &s;troke in a minute. From this circum&s;tance, it was &s;uppo&s;ed they were burying the dead, who had been killed the day before.
<PB N="301" REF="380">
No violence, however, was either done or at|tempted this day, though the girls that were on board gave us to under&s;tand, that their country|men only waited a favourable opportunity to attack the &s;hips.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 15th, our great cutter, which was moored to the buoy, was mi&s;&s;ing from her moorings, and, upon examination, the boat's painter was found cut two fathoms from the buoy, and the remainder of the rope gone with the boat.</P>
<P>This gave cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome villainy was concerting; and, in order to prevent the ill-con&s;equences that might follow, both Captains met on board the Re&s;olution, to con&s;ult what was be&s;t to be done on this critical occa&s;ion. The officers from both &s;hips were pre&s;ent at this coun|cil, where it was re&s;olved to &s;eize the King, and to confine him on board till the boat &s;hould be returned.</P>
<P>With this view, early on the morning of the 16th, Capt. Cook, with Mr. Phillips, Lieutenant of Marines, and nine of his men, went on &s;hore, under cover of the guns of both &s;hips, to one &s;ide of the bay where the King re&s;ided; and Mr. King, &s;econd Lieutenant of the Re&s;olution, who had always been &s;tationed with a guard to protect the working party and the waterers on &s;hore, went, as u&s;ual, to the other &s;ide. The Indians, ob&s;erving our motions, and &s;eeing the &s;hips warp|ing towards the towns, of which there were two, one on each &s;ide the bay, they concluded that our de&s;ign was to &s;eize their marine. In con&s;equence of which, mo&s;t of their large war canoes took the alarm, and were making off, when our guns, loaded with grape and cani&s;ter &s;hot, drove them back; and the Captain and his guard landed without oppo&s;ition. We ob&s;erved, however, that their warriors were clothed in their military dre&s;s,
<PB N="302" REF="381">
though without arms, and that they were gather|ing together in a body from every direction, their Chiefs a&s;&s;uming a very different countenance to what they u&s;ually wore upon all former occa&s;ions. However, Capt. Cook, attended by the Lieute|nant of Marines, a Serjeant, and nine privates, regardle&s;s of appearances, proceeded directly to the King's re&s;idence, where they found him &s;eated on the ground, with about twelve of his Chiefs round him, who all pro&s;trated them&s;elves on &s;ee|ing the Orono enter. The Captain addre&s;&s;ed the King in the milde&s;t terms, a&s;&s;uring him that no violence was intended again&s;t his per&s;on or any of his peo|ple, except again&s;t tho&s;e who had been guilty of a mo&s;t unprecedented act of robbery, by cutting from her moorings one of the &s;hip's boats, with|out which they could neither conveniently water the &s;hips, nor carry on the nece&s;&s;ary communica|tion with the &s;hore; calling upon the King, at the &s;ame time, to give orders for the boat to be immediately re&s;tored, and inviting him, in the mo&s;t friendly manner, to accompany him on board, till his orders &s;hould be carried into execution. The King prote&s;ted his total ignorance of the theft; &s;aid, he was very ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;co|vering the thief, and &s;hould be glad to &s;ee him puni&s;hed; and &s;hewed no unwillingne&s;s him&s;elf to tru&s;t his per&s;on with the Orono, though he had lately exerci&s;ed very unu&s;ual &s;everities again&s;t his people. He was told that the tumultuous ap|pearance of his people, and their repeated rob|beries, made &s;ome uncommon &s;everities nece&s;&s;ary; but that not the lea&s;t hurt &s;hould be done to the meane&s;t inhabitant of his i&s;land by any per&s;on belonging to the &s;hips, without exemplary pu|ni&s;hment; and all that was nece&s;&s;ary for the con|tinuance of peace was, to pledge him&s;elf for the
<PB N="303" REF="382">
hone&s;ty of his people. With that view, and that view only, the Captain &s;aid he came to reque&s;t the King to place confidence in him, and to make his &s;hip his re&s;idence, as the mo&s;t effectual means of putting a &s;top to the robberies that were now daily and hourly committed and committing, by his people, both at the tents and on board the &s;hips, and were &s;o daring as to become in&s;ufferable. The King, upon this remon&s;trance, was preparing to comply, and his two &s;ons were actually on board the pinnace to accompany the Orono, when a wo|man, mother to the boys, and a great favourite of the King's, came after them, and, with many tears and entreaties, be&s;ought them to come on &s;hore and not to go on board the &s;hips. The Chiefs, at the &s;ame time, began to take the alarm; but the good old King, not yet &s;u&s;pecting, or pretending not to &s;u&s;pect, any treachery, had made him&s;elf ready to accompany the Captain, and was actually on his way; but by this time the women and children were &s;ent away, and the men put on their war mats, and armed them|&s;elves, and &s;o great a body of Indians were got together, and had lined the &s;hore, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible they could break through the multitude, who now began to behave outrageou&s;ly, and to in&s;ult the guard. Capt. Cook, ob&s;erving their behaviour, gave orders to the officer of marines to make way, and if any one oppo&s;ed, to fire upon and in&s;tantly di&s;patch him. This order the Lieutenant endeavoured to carry into execution, and a lane was made for the King and his Chiefs to get to the boats; but they had &s;carce reached the water-&s;ide, when the word was given, that the Orono (for &s;o they called Capt. Cook) was about to carry off their King to kill him. In an in&s;tant a number of their fighting men broke
<PB N="304" REF="383">
from the crowd, and with clubs and &s;tones ru&s;hed in upon the guard, four of whom were pre&s;ently di&s;patched. A ruffian making a &s;troke at Capt. Cook, was &s;hot dead by the Captain him&s;elf, who, having a double-barreled gun, was aiming at another, when a &s;avage came behind him, and &s;triking him on the head with his club, felled him to the ground; and then thru&s;t his pahooa through his body with &s;uch force, that, entering between his &s;houlders, the point of it came out at his brea&s;t. The quarrel now became general. The guns from the &s;hips began to pour in their fire upon the crowd, and the mu&s;quetry from the boars; but &s;uch was their intrepidity, that, con|trary to all expectation, they &s;tood their ground, and carried off in triumph the bodies of the dead.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Capt. Cook, who&s;e death was univer|&s;ally deplored, Corporal Thomas, and three pri|vates, Hinkes, Allen, and Fadget, fell victims to their fury; and three more of the marines were de&s;perately wounded. Lieut. Phillips, who had received a wound between the &s;houlders with a pahooa, &s;hot the man dead who had wounded him, ju&s;t as he was going to repeat his blow: it &s;eemed as if it was again&s;t our Commodore that their vengeance was chiefly directed, by who&s;e order they &s;uppo&s;ed their king was to be forced on board, and puni&s;hed at his di&s;cretion. Seeing him fall, they &s;et up a great &s;hout, and his body was in&s;tantly &s;urrounded by the enemy, who &s;natching the dagger out of each other's hands, they &s;hewed a &s;avage eagerne&s;s to have a &s;hare in his de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Thus fell the greate&s;t navigator that this or any other nation could boa&s;t; the account of who&s;e death was tran&s;mitted to England by Pro|fe&s;&s;or

Pallas, from Peter&s;burg, long before the arrival of our journali&s;t; and with &s;uch circum|&s;tances of agreement in the principal facts, as &s;uf|ficiently prove the authenticity of both.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;or &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"The inhabitants &s;hewed Capt. Cook (during his fir&s;t &s;tay) a re&s;pect that bordered on adoration; but on his &s;econd land|ing they grew more thievi&s;h than before; and at la&s;t, the cutter belonging to the Di&s;covery was cut loo&s;e and carried away. The day after this happened the Captain, with his Lieutenant, and nine marines, landed. He went up to the re|&s;idence of the chief Terreboo. He was received with re&s;pect; but he found a great crowd a&s;&s;em|bled with the chief. Some of them grew in&s;o|lent as he made his complaints; one of them in particular indulged his grimaces in &s;o provoking a manner, that the Captain di&s;charged at him the &s;hot of his fowling-piece. On which a ge|neral commotion en&s;ued. The Lieutenant fired, and killed one dead upon the &s;pot; but in&s;tead of di&s;per&s;ing, they now made a general attack, and though the marines fired one round with great effect, the crowd was not intimidated, but ru&s;hed on with &s;uch rapidity, that there was no time to load again. In the fir&s;t on&s;et Capt. Cook and four of his people were unhappily killed upon the &s;pot; and it was with great difficulty that the Lieutenant and the remaining marines could make their retreat, mo&s;t of them wounded; and it would have been almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for them to have e&s;caped, had it not been for the fire from the pinnace and long-boat, that lay at &s;ome di&s;|tance from the beach. Capt. Clerke &s;aw no po&s;|&s;ibility of revenging the lo&s;s of his gallant coun|tryman but with great &s;laughter, he therefore
<PB N="306" REF="386">
kept upon the defen&s;ive."</Q>&mdash;To return to our Journali&s;t.</P>
<P>The dead being pa&s;t recovery, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the living was now to be regarded. The Re&s;olution was without her ma&s;t, and lay in a manner at the mercy of the &s;avages, who it was every moment expected, would have cut away her moorings and drifted her on &s;hore. It was therefore the fir&s;t care of Capt. Clerke, who &s;ucceeded to the command, to order the ma&s;t to be floated away, and to get the tents and all our other baggage on board. For this purpo&s;e no time was to be lo&s;t. While many of the na|tives lay dead upon the beach, it was judged the propere&s;t time to take advantage of that inter|val of inactivity, which always &s;ucceeds any con|&s;iderable exertion of Indian ferocity. Lieutenant King, who, as has been ob&s;erved before, com|manded the working-party on the other &s;ide the bay, and who had cultivated a friend&s;hip with the prie&s;ts, who&s;e dwellings were contiguous to the Morai, was all this while ignorant of what was going forward; but could not help being under inexpre&s;&s;ible anxiety at &s;eeing the extraordinary agitation by land, and hearing the firing from the &s;hips at &s;ea, and the boats near the &s;hore; but at the &s;ame time had a&s;&s;ured the prie&s;ts, who were equally alarmed, that whatever might be the mat|ter, they &s;hould be &s;afe; was not a little &s;tartled, when ju&s;t at that critical moment, two great &s;hot from the Di&s;covery cut a tree in the middle, under which &s;ome of them were &s;itting, and &s;plit a piece from a rock in a direct line to their dwellings: for Capt. Clerke being under no le&s;s concern for Lieut. King and tho&s;e under his command, and having no clue, but appearances to go by, had cau&s;ed
<PB N="307" REF="387">
the fire of the great guns to be directed to that quarter, as &s;oon as the natives were di&s;per&s;ed from the other. Our whole force was therefore col|lected, and, having landed under cover of our guns, we marched rapidly up the hill, with bayo|nets fixed, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Morai, which &s;tood on elevated ground, and gave us an advan|tage over the &s;avages, who could not approach us from the &s;hore, neither could they attack us from the towns, without being expo&s;ed to our fire from the &s;hips. They made &s;everal un&s;uc|ce&s;sful attempts to di&s;lodge us, but were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s. After &s;u&s;taining an unequal conflict for three hours, in which &s;everal of them were killed, without being able to make any impre&s;&s;ion on our &s;mall body, and without our lo&s;ing a man, though &s;everal were much hurt by the &s;tones from their &s;lings, they at length di&s;per&s;ed, and left us ma&s;ters of our tents and of all our other property.</P>
<P>Our next care was to recover the bodies of our dead. A &s;trong party under Lieut. King, were &s;ent out in the pinnaces and boats, with a white flag, in token of peace, to endeavour to procure them. They were met by Koah, a Chief, (with whom Mr. King was well acquainted) and of note among the &s;avages, at the head of a va&s;t multitude, without at fir&s;t an&s;wering our &s;ignal; but Mr. King, commanding the armed boats to &s;top, and going him&s;elf in a &s;mall boat alone, with a white flag in his hand, had the &s;atisfac|tion to be in&s;tantly under&s;tood; the men threw off their war-mats; the women returned to the beach, and Koah &s;hewed equal confidence, by &s;wimming off with a flag in his hand, and on en|tering the boat where Mr. King &s;at, with as much unconcern as if nothing had happened: being told
<PB N="308" REF="388">
that they were come to demand the body of Capt. Cook, or to declare war, if it was not in&s;tantly re&s;tored, he a&s;&s;ured the Lieutenant, that he would go him&s;elf and procure it, begged a piece of iron of him, and joyfully &s;wam on &s;hore, calling out to his countrymen, that now we were all friends again; but notwith&s;tanding this Chief's di&s;&s;embled friend&s;hip, our men in the boats, who had entered into parley with the natives, were informed, that the warriors were then on the back of the hill, cutting up and dividing the bodies of the &s;lain. While we remained in our boats, &s;everal other Chiefs came to the water-&s;ide; and one in parti|cular, with Capt. Cook's hanger, which he drew in a vaunting manner, and brandi&s;hed it over his head; others &s;hewed them&s;elves with the &s;poils taken from the dead; one having a jacket, ano|ther a &s;hirt, a third a pair of trow&s;ers, and &s;o on; in&s;ulting us, as it were, with the trophies of their victory.</P>
<P>At this time it was thought prudent to &s;tifle our re&s;entment, and to re&s;erve our vengeance till a more favourable opportunity. We were now in want of water; our &s;ails and rigging in a &s;hattered condition; our cordage bad, and our repairs not near fini&s;hed; all therefore we had to do, was to re|main upon the defen&s;ive till we were better pro|vided.</P>
<P>At the clo&s;e of the evening, as &s;oon as it was dark, a canoe was heard paddling towards the Re|&s;olution, in which were two men. As it approached, both &s;entinels fired, but without hurting either of the men, though the balls went through the bot|tom of the canoe. Notwith&s;tanding this, the canoe came clo&s;e under the &s;hip's &s;tern; and one of the men calling out <HI>Tinne, Tinne,</HI> (the name Mr. King was known by) whom the Prie&s;ts had always
<PB N="309" REF="389">
&s;uppo&s;ed to be the Orono's &s;on, and, therefore, the Earee of the &s;hip, this excited every one's curio|&s;ity, and orders were given to admit them on board; they were prie&s;ts, and produced a piece of fle&s;h, carefully wrapped up in a cloth, which they &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured us was part of the thigh of our late Commander; that he &s;aw it cut from the bone, but believed that all the fle&s;h of the body was burnt; that the head and all the bones, ex|cept what belonged to the trunk, were in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Terreoboo, and the other Chiefs; that what we &s;aw, had been brought to Kaoa, the High Prie&s;t, to be made u&s;e of in &s;ome religious ceremony; and that he had &s;ent it as a proof of the &s;incerity of his innocence and his friend&s;hip. Being a&s;ked, if any part of the fle&s;h had been eaten, they expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t horror at the idea. They afterwards a&s;ked, with &s;ome apparent apprehen&s;ion, when the Orono would come again, and what he would do to them on his return? The &s;ame que&s;tion had been a&s;ked by others, which &s;hews, the opinion they entertain of the &s;pirit's power after it is &s;eparated from the body. They then de&s;ired to be &s;et at liberty, which was granted. One of the men was the Prie&s;t who had attended Capt. Cook, and who was ready on all occa&s;ions, to fall down and wor&s;hip him. He la|mented his lo&s;s with abundance of tears, and earne&s;tly be&s;ought us to keep their coming a &s;e|cret, for if it &s;hould be known, it would prove fatal to their whole fraternity. They farther in|formed us, that 17 of their countrymen were killed in the fir&s;t action at Kowrowa, of whom five were Chiefs; and that Kaneena and his brother, our particular friends, were among the number; eight, they &s;aid, were killed at the ob&s;ervatory, of whom three were of the fir&s;t rank. As this was the fact,
<PB N="310" REF="390">
the &s;tory that was given out to conceal it, may be worth relating.</P>
<P>On the 19th, &s;ays our journali&s;t, the father and mother of two girls, who had concealed them&s;elves on board the &s;hip, came in the dead of the night, in their canoe, loaded with cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit, which they had been gathering in the day for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, as a &s;upply for their children, le&s;t, from what had happened, they &s;hould have been &s;uffered to die for want; ac|quainting us at the &s;ame time with a treacherous de&s;ign of their countrymen to cut our cables, and drift the &s;hips a&s;hore. They were taken on board, and detained pri&s;oners till morning, when not an Indian was to be &s;een near the harbour, but &s;uch as were old and feeble, and knew not how to make their e&s;cape. The informers were tenderly treated, had pre&s;ents made them, and were after|wards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, at their own de&s;ire, upon a neigh|bouring i&s;land, with every token of kindne&s;s.&mdash;The truth is, the Prie&s;ts had de&s;ired the guard-boat to attend them, le&s;t they &s;hould have been fired at, and interrupted by the guard-boats of the other &s;hip, by which they might have been di&s;covered, and perhaps put to death.</P>
<P>Among other incidents of the pre&s;ent day, Feb. 16, there was one which could not be under|&s;tood. Two boys were &s;een &s;wimming towards the &s;hips, &s;inging, as they approached the &s;hips, a mournful and plaintive &s;ong. They had each a long &s;pear in his hand, which, on boarding the Di&s;covery, they delivered to the Officer on the deck, and then departed. Who &s;ent them, or for what purpo&s;e, we never could learn.</P>
<P>On the 17th, the different promotions took place, and according to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the Offi|cers changed &s;hips; Capt. Clerke went on board
<PB N="311" REF="391">
the Re&s;olution, and Mr. Gore, fir&s;t Lieutenant of the Re&s;olution, took the command of the Di&s;|covery.</P>
<P>On the 18th both &s;hips were again warped near the &s;hore, and a &s;pring put upon their cables, in order to cover the boats which were &s;ent to com|pleat our complement of water. On this motion crowds of inhabitants were &s;een to a&s;&s;emble, with a large black flag di&s;played, which we interpreted as a &s;ignal for war; but we afterwards found that it was part of their ceremony in burying their dead. Under this mi&s;take a few guns were fired from the &s;hips to di&s;per&s;e them, by which the King's nephew, Maiha Maiha, was wounded, and a poor woman lo&s;t her arm. This made a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on the whole body of Indians, and we were left in quiet both this and the next day, to pur&s;ue our repairs and compleat our hold.</P>
<P>On the 19th they began again to be trouble|&s;ome. In the morning, while the boats were loading, at the well, the &s;tones came about the watermen like hail, &s;ome of them of more than a pound weight; one in particular was &s;een com|ing; but who threw it, no one could tell. This being attended to, a native was ob&s;erved to creep out of a cavern, who, as &s;oon as he had di&s;charged his &s;tone, retired back to his place of &s;helter. Him we marked, and returned to our &s;hips; and it being now apparent that nothing was to be gained by fair means, orders were given to &s;trike terror among them, by pur&s;uing them with fire and &s;word. About two in the afternoon, all who were able to bear arms, as well &s;ailors and arti|ficers as marines, were mu&s;tered, and preparations made to &s;u&s;tain them, while with lighted torches they rowed on &s;hore, and &s;et fire to the S. E. town, pur&s;uing the frighted inhabitants while their
<PB N="312" REF="392">
hou&s;es were in flames, with unrelenting fury. Many were put to death, and all driven to &s;eek &s;helter where they could, &s;carce a hou&s;e having e&s;caped the general conflagration. In this vin|dictive enterprize, the cavern or hole of the crafty Indian, who&s;e in&s;olence had been one principal cau&s;e of the de&s;olation that followed, was not for|gotten. His cavern had been marked, as has al|ready been ob&s;erved, and on &s;eeing our &s;ailors ap|proach it, &s;uch was his inveteracy, that he heaved a huge &s;tone at the a&s;&s;ailants, one of whom he dangerou&s;ly wounded, but was in&s;tantly di&s;patched by the di&s;charge of three mu&s;kets, and a bayonet run through his body. Our vengeance being now fully executed, we returned to the &s;hips, loaded with the &s;poils of the towns, con&s;i&s;ting of bows and arrows, clubs, and arms of all kinds, which they u&s;e in battle; and having the heads of two of their fighting men, of which the courageous native was one, &s;tuck at the bows of the pinnaces, as a terror to the enemy from ever daring again to mole&s;t us.</P>
<P>About four in the afternoon of the 20th, ten girls came down to the well, where the waterers were bu&s;y, with quantities of fruit, as much as they could carry, for which they would take no|thing in return, only praying to be taken on board. This was denied them, as peremptory or|ders had been given by Capt. Clerke, forbidding the admi&s;&s;ion of any more of their women.</P>
<P>This day, in the morning, a Chief was &s;een coming down the hill, followed by a number of boys, with a white flag di&s;played, and carrying boughs and green branches in their hands. They came &s;inging to the water &s;ide; but that did not prevent their receiving the fire of a party that was placed as a guard. On &s;eeing his en&s;ign an&s;wered
<PB N="313" REF="393">
by a white flag at each mizen-top-ma&s;t-head, he, accompanied with three other Chiefs, came on board, having &s;ome cocoa-nuts, plantains, and bread-fruit, as pre&s;ents to the Commander, for which they would accept of nothing in return. This Chief, who&s;e name was Eappo, came to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and, as a token of his &s;ince|rity, promi&s;ed to collect the bones of our decea&s;ed warrior, as he called him, and to bring them, and lay them at our feet. This was the token of the mo&s;t perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that a native warrior could make to his conqueror; and this was accepted on the part of our Commander. In this manner, and on the&s;e conditions, peace was to be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>At nine in the morning of the next day, the &s;ame old Chief returned, attended by a more nu|merous &s;uit than before, having &s;everal large hogs added to his peace-offerings; and with him, likewi&s;e, he brought the bones of Capt. Cook, his back-bone, and the bones of his feet only ex|cepted, which he promi&s;ed to produce the next vi&s;it he made. On examination, the head ap|peared to have been &s;calped; the face was en|tirely gone; the hands had the fle&s;h on, but &s;cored and &s;alted; and, as he a&s;&s;ured the Captain, mo&s;t of the fle&s;h be&s;ides was burnt. Our Com|mander made &s;igns to return the cutter, but was told it was broke up and burnt for the iron. The arms belonging to the marines, who were killed, were next demanded; but the&s;e, it was &s;aid, were carried up the country by common people, and were irrecoverable. Some pre&s;ents were made to this friendly Chief, who departed well &s;atisfied. We were now preparing to depart, when provi&s;ions of all &s;orts came pouring in upon us fa&s;ter than we could con&s;ume them. The Chief kept his promi&s;e, and</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="394">On the 23d, Eappo and the King's &s;on, came on board, and brought the bones of the Captain that were mi&s;&s;ing: the&s;e were all placed in due form, in a ca&s;e made for the purpo&s;e, and under a triple di&s;charge from the &s;hips, buried in the bay. The terror of the natives on this occa&s;ion was increa&s;ed, by a four pound ball being loaded by mi&s;take, which fortunately did no other mi&s;|chief than that of exciting the jealou&s;y of the na|tives, that our profe&s;&s;ions of peace were not &s;in|cere; which po&s;&s;ibly might be the ca&s;e with him who loaded the gun, as the &s;ailors in general could hardly be re&s;trained from violence, whenever a native came within their power. Nothing more remained now to be done.</P>
<P>This day we had the &s;atisfaction of getting the forema&s;t of the Re&s;olution &s;hipt, which was a work of great labour, and &s;ome difficulty, as the ropes were now become rotten, and unable to &s;u&s;tain the purcha&s;e; however, that being at length ac|compli&s;hed, and the repairs compleated, &s;o far at lea&s;t as our circum&s;tances would allow, we bent our &s;ails in the morning; and were vi&s;ited by many of our former friends, among whom was the King's younge&s;t &s;on, a boy of about fourteen years of age, of whom Capt. Cook was remarkably fond; and the boy, in return, was no le&s;s attached to the Captain. He came to expre&s;s his &s;orrow for the accident that had happened, which he did by a plentiful flow of tears. He gave us to un|der&s;tand, that his two brothers were killed, and that his father was retired to an inacce&s;&s;ible place. Capt. Clerke made him &s;ome pre&s;ents that were plea&s;ing to him, and he departed very much com|forted.</P>
<P>About 7 in the evening, a breeze &s;pringing up in our favour, we unmoored, and &s;oon left
<PB N="315" REF="395">
Karakakooa Bay, for that was the name of the bay in which we had been moored, &s;haping our cour&s;e to the N. W. Nothing remarkable till</P>
<P>The 28th, when we opened upon a fine bay, in one of the Leeward I&s;lands, called by the inhabi|tants O-aa-ah, where the &s;hips came to an anchor, and where both Captains landed: they found a fine running river, but bracki&s;h towards the &s;ea; they therefore made a very &s;hort &s;tay. Several of the inhabitants came on board, who were &s;o im|moderately fond of iron, that they endeavoured to wrench the very ring-bolts from the hatches. Here we put a&s;hore the family that accompanied us from O-why-e, and here we purcha&s;ed a few &s;mall &s;wine; &s;ome bread-fruit and plantains, and a quantity of a root called Ta-ee, not unlike fern-root, but of an enormous &s;ize, &s;ome weighing from 60 to 70 pounds. It is a powerful anti-&s;corbutic, of the &s;accharine kind. Pounded, we made an excellent liquor from it, very plea&s;ant, and exceedingly whole&s;ome. We had quantities of it when we reached Kam&s;hat&s;ka, and as good as when fir&s;t purcha&s;ed. Having found nothing el&s;e to engage our attention in this i&s;land, we &s;et &s;ail in the evening; and</P>
<P>Next day, March 1, about noon, we moored in our old birth, which, notwith&s;tanding, had a mo&s;t beautiful appearance from the &s;ea, being well cultivated, and full of villages. We made &s;ail in the evening for Atooi, where we had an|chored the preceding &s;ummer. We learned that the name of the i&s;land we had ju&s;t left, was Woa|hoo, lat. 21.50. N. long. 202.15. E. Here we were received with &s;eeming coolne&s;s. Hogs, and the produce of the i&s;land, were brought us indeed in abundance; but when our ca&s;ks were landed, in order to exchange our water (that of O-why-he
<PB N="316" REF="396">
being both bitter and bracki&s;h, and the water here excellent) the coopers were no &s;ooner &s;et to work, than one native &s;natched up an adze, another a bucket, a third a bag of nails, and &s;o on; and this among a crowd of people of more than four or five hundred in number. To put a &s;top to the&s;e depredations, orders were given to fire over their heads; but this not having the de|&s;ired effect, a gun from the &s;hips threw them all into confu&s;ion. Two were &s;een to drop; and by the &s;hrieks and cries of the women, more were &s;up|po&s;ed to have been killed or wounded. For a while the multitude retreated; but being rallied by &s;ome of their Chiefs, who doubtle&s;s had heard that we were not invulnerable, they returned in greater numbers than before, when it was thought prudent to lay a&s;ide watering, and to provide for our own &s;afety. All hands were now ordered to their po&s;ts, and an engagement commenced in earne&s;t, when the Indians in&s;tantly gave way, af|ter a few being killed and wounded by our fire; and they never again offered the lea&s;t violence during our &s;tay. A perfect agreement took place, and pre&s;ents were mutually exchanged on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for our cold reception at fir&s;t, was, becau&s;e we had introduced among their women a bad di&s;order, when at that harbour be|fore, of which many of their people had died.&mdash;But now, peace being e&s;tabli&s;hed, all the bad wa|ter was &s;tarted from both &s;hips, and a plentiful &s;tock of good water taken on board, to &s;erve us during our long run to Kam&s;hat&s;ka, for which we were preparing. Here one of the Chiefs, named Noo-oh-a, expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to accompany us in our voyage, when, being told that we were never more to return to that i&s;land, he lamented the op|portunity
<PB N="317" REF="397">
he had lo&s;t when we were here before; and pointing to the &s;un, &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e that we &s;hould vi&s;it that luminary in our cour&s;e, and that the thunder and lightning of our guns, and that which came from above, were both derived from the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>
<P>Before our departure, an Indian brought on board our &s;hip, a piece of iron, to be fa&s;hioned into a podooa, which, upon examination, ap|peared to be the bolt of &s;ome large piece of &s;hip timbers, larger than any that our &s;hips could pro|duce. This excited the curio&s;ity of the officers on board; but no farther di&s;covery could be made, but that it had been taken from a part of a large &s;hip that had been drifted on the coa&s;t &s;ince our leaving the i&s;land in 1778. It was of a paler colour than our iron; but of what nation, we were unable to di&s;cover.</P>
<P>From this harbour we &s;ailed on the 9th, and vi&s;ited the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the i&s;land, where we had likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed a part of the former winter. Here we were received with much kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality; and here we purcha&s;ed yams and po|tatoes for our &s;ummer's con&s;umption, which the companies of both &s;hips were glad to accept in exchange for their allowance of bread, that part of their food being both &s;canty and bad.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the natural productions of the country, we purcha&s;ed in the&s;e i&s;lands many tons of &s;alt, much of their cordage and cloth, and a great va|riety of artificial curio&s;ities, &s;uch as their weapons of war, their in&s;truments for fi&s;hing; their cloaks and coverlets; their caps, ma&s;ks, nets, in&s;tru|ments of mu&s;ic; their needles, thread, working tools, bracelets, ear-jewels, and, in &s;hort, almo&s;t every thing that was new to us, or which was pe|culiar to them; among which were &s;ome hou&s;e|hold
<PB N="318" REF="398">
uten&s;ils, and prints for impre&s;&s;ing their cloth. The i&s;land we are now preparing to leave is named Oneeheow, and lies in lat. 21.49. N. and in long. E. from London, 193 nearly.</P>
<P>On the 15th, we made &s;ail; and &s;oon after were informed that Capt. Clerke was taken ill. We at fir&s;t &s;tood to the We&s;tward, veering a little to the South, in &s;earch of a &s;mall i&s;land, named Modoo Pappapa, which, we were told, abounded in turtle. We continued this cour&s;e till</P>
<P>The 30th, when we were in lat. 20.19. N. long. 180.40. per watch. We now altered our cour&s;e, and &s;teered N. W.</P>
<P>April 1, we continued &s;teering N. W. &frac12; W. lat. 21.46. N. long. 180.2.</P>
<P>On the 3d, we cro&s;&s;ed the Northern Tropic, long. 177.39. E. &s;teering N. W. by N. in a di|rect cour&s;e for Kam&s;hat&s;ka. On the 3d day, after leaving the i&s;land of Oneeheow, it began to blow a hard gale, which continued, with very little in|termi&s;&s;ion, to the pre&s;ent day, when our &s;hip be|came very leaky, and we were informed that the Re&s;olution was much wor&s;e than the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>On the 9th, for the fir&s;t time, &s;ince our leaving Oneeheow, or Nehu, as the &s;ailors called it, we had an ob&s;ervation, and found our&s;elves in lat. 32.16. long. 160.40. E.</P>
<P>On the 10th, we ob&s;erved a tropic bird hover|ing about the &s;hip, and by her motions we ex|pected her to light, being far to the Northward of her proper climate; however &s;he left us, and made for the Re&s;olution. In the evening it began to blow, with heavy rain, and continued an un|remitting gale till</P>
<P>The 13th, when we were in lat. 39.50. very cold and foggy. As we now began to approach the higher Northern latitudes, the flannel jackets
<PB N="319" REF="399">
that had been &s;tored up while we were among the tropical i&s;lands, were again brought into u&s;e, and were of infinite &s;ervice to the poor men. We now altered our cour&s;e to the Ea&s;tward, having great &s;igns of land on our larboard beam.</P>
<P>On the 15th, being in lat. 41.59. the &s;igns of land increa&s;ed. The weather being fine and clear, we &s;eized this opportunity to &s;earch for the leak, and, knowing it to be forwards, we moved the &s;ails from the fore &s;ail-room, and found them wringing wet; but the leak was out of our reach; however, when the weather was fine, it gave us very little trouble.</P>
<P>On the 16th, the Re&s;olution's boat came on board, and Capt. Gore and our fir&s;t Lieutenant went to vi&s;it Capt. Clerke, who &s;till continued very ill. On their return, they brought a di&s;mal account of the condition of the Re&s;olution; &s;he became leaky on the 7th, when it blew a tempe&s;t. On the carpenters going down to the cockpit for lights, they were alarmed by finding them&s;elves over their &s;hoes in water, and, upon further exa|mination, the ca&s;ks in the fi&s;h-room and &s;pirit-room were driving one again&s;t another, by which two ca&s;ks of French brandy were &s;taved. They then &s;earched forwards, where they found the coal-hole &s;ix feet deep in water, and the &s;hip's whole complement of paint de&s;troyed; &s;everal ca&s;ks of &s;hells and curio&s;ities &s;taved, the light-room deck blown up, and the bulk-head between the gunner's &s;tore-room and the coal-hole, bur&s;t open. In this alarming &s;ituation, they continued during the whole time that this &s;tormy weather la&s;ted, pumping night and day; and every officer in the &s;hip (the Captain, who was ill, only ex|cepted) took his turn with the common men, who were &s;ickening apace with fatigue; nor were
<PB N="320" REF="400">
they then relieved from hard duty, when our gen|tlemen left the &s;hip; which was the rea&s;on we could make no &s;tay to examine the extent of De Gama's or Company's Land, which, however, we di&s;covered, by our run, not to extend farther to the Ea&s;tward than it is marked in our ordinary maps. The mi&s;fortune of the Re&s;olution's people did not end with the damages above recited; much of their bread was &s;poiled, and they were forced to take from us a ton of yams to &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>On the 18th, we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Re&s;olution; but by every appearance were at no great di&s;tance from land. Large pieces of timber drifted by us, and land birds innumerable were &s;een to the We&s;tward. We were now in lat. 46.10. and our long. 160.25. running at the rate of &s;even or eight knots an hour.</P>
<P>On the 19th, we came in &s;ight of the Re&s;olu|tion: and though it blew hard, they threw out the &s;ignal for us to make &s;ail, from whence we con|cluded that the leak &s;till di&s;tre&s;&s;ed them. At noon we were in lat. 48.38. and long. 159.10.</P>
<P>On the 20th, we had a deep &s;now, attended with fro&s;t, by which our men were expo&s;ed to incredible hard&s;hips. It fell &s;o heavy upon the decks and rigging, that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible to keep them clear, or, not being clear, to make the ropes traver&s;e. Fortunately it cea&s;ed freezing in the night.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, we were in lat. 49.48. when we began to get every thing in readine&s;s for coming to anchor.</P>
<P>On the 22d, we were in the latitude of Lon|don; the water of a milky colour, but no &s;ound|ings at eighty-five fathom. In the evening, the Re&s;olution made the &s;ignal to tack &s;hip, and we
<PB N="321" REF="401">
never afterwards &s;aw her till our arrival at our de&s;|tined harbour.</P>
<P>On the 23d, we came in &s;ight of land, very barren, very rugged, and covered with &s;now; from whence we were di&s;tant not above a league, with our &s;tarboard tacks on board, the water near the &s;hore black with wild fowl, and a &s;heet of ice &s;kirting the land, covered with &s;ea-lions, &s;eals, and other amphibious animals. At half pa&s;t ten, P. M. we were put about, finding by our log|book and watch, that we were fifty miles to lee|ward of our port.</P>
<P>On the 25th, we were out of &s;ight of land, with a heavy gale, a fall of &s;now, piercing cold, and twenty of our hands fro&s;t-nipped.</P>
<P>The 26th, it blew hard from the N. E. We kept working to windward, which doubled our labour; and our concern for our Commodore in|crea&s;ed &s;o much the more, as we judged by our own &s;ufferings what mu&s;t be the fate of the Re|&s;olution, that was much le&s;s able to &s;truggle with the &s;torm than the Di&s;covery. The &s;torm conti|nuing with &s;leet and &s;now, three men could &s;carce do the work of one.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es, our leak increa&s;ed to an alarming degree.</P>
<P>On the 28th, we made 17 inches in three hours. The wind dying away, we tried the current, and found we drifted half a mile an hour to the South|ward. A man was &s;ent up to the ma&s;t-head, to look round for the Re&s;olution, but without &s;uc|ceeding. We now gave her over for lo&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 29th, we &s;tood in for the land, and at two in the afternoon, we came in &s;ight of the en|trance of the bay of Kam&s;hat&s;ka, then di&s;tant be|tween &s;even and eight miles to the Southward. We made &s;ail, and &s;tood right in; but finding it froze
<PB N="322" REF="402">
over, we judged that the Re&s;olution could not po&s;&s;ibly be there, and therefore concluded that &s;he mu&s;t have gone to the bottom.</P>
<P>Early next morning, we once more attempted the entrance of the bay, and finding the ice drifted, we conceived hopes that we might be able to force a pa&s;&s;age through the loo&s;e ice, which, now the weather was fine, did not appear &s;o for|midable as before. About noon, a plea&s;ant breeze &s;prung up, and we directed our cour&s;e to a flag we &s;aw di&s;played ju&s;t within the bay, and happily &s;ucceeded, drooping our anchor in twenty fa|thom water, within le&s;s than three leagues of our intended harbour. In about half an hour, while our boats were &s;till looking out for a pa&s;&s;age, we ob&s;erved at a di&s;tance two boats making towards us, one of which we knew to belong to the Re&s;o|lution; the other belonged to the Ru&s;&s;ians. No joy could exceed that which the certainty of the &s;afety of the Re&s;olution &s;pread through the whole &s;hip's company of the Di&s;covery. She had been in port ever &s;ince the 27th, and had given us over for lo&s;t, never expecting to &s;ee us more. She had met with &s;ome damage in her &s;ails and rigging; but by her fortunately hitting the harbour, &s;he had e&s;caped much of the di&s;tre&s;s that we &s;uffered from the &s;everity of the weather.</P>
<P>Early on the fir&s;t of May, we weighed, having the Re&s;olution's boat to direct us. Soon after day-light, we were within the light-hou&s;e near the entrance of the harbour, but were oppo&s;ed by a &s;trong tide from the &s;hore, which drifting huge pieces of floating ice again&s;t us, made our fur|ther progre&s;s both dangerous and fatiguing but, having the wind fair, about five in the even|ing we came to in &s;ight of the town, and &s;oon af|ter dropt anchor near the Re&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="403">On the 2d, the Re&s;olution unmoored, and both &s;hips came to, and moored within a mile of the town, and within a cable's length of the ice, which entirely &s;hut up the head of the bay.&mdash;Here we found only one &s;mall &s;loop, about fifty tons, which, as &s;oon as the ice was clear, was bound on a trading voyage to the Northward.&mdash;We had no &s;ooner dropt anchor than our boat was ordered out, and our Captain, with &s;everal other gentlemen, went to vi&s;it Capt. Clerke, and to take his orders for our future proceedings. We found him &s;till growing weaker and weaker; we there|fore &s;hortened our &s;tay.</P>
<P>On the 3d, &s;ome of the principal officers and gentlemen went on &s;hore, and were received by a &s;ubaltern, who now had the command of the fort, &s;ituated clo&s;e by a little mi&s;erable town, called St. Peter and St. Paul, which, by its appearance, could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to furni&s;h provi&s;ions for the &s;hips crew a &s;ingle week. We &s;oon learnt that the Governor lived at a town called Bolcherit&s;k, di&s;tant about 135 miles; and that an expre&s;s had been &s;ent to him on the 29th, about noon, in a &s;ledge drawn by dogs, to notify our arrival. The &s;ubaltern, in the mean time, &s;hewed us every ci|vility. We found on our landing a &s;ledge drawn by dogs, in readine&s;s to receive our Commander, and to conduct him to the re&s;idence of the officer already mentioned, where he found &s;ome gentle|men belonging to the Re&s;olution. It was not, however, a little &s;trange, that though we were ex|pected, and that the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia had given orders to her Governor to furni&s;h us with every accommodation in his power, that not a per&s;on was to be found that under&s;tood any other language than that of the natives of the place, and of Ru&s;|&s;ia; neither of which languages was intelligible to
<PB N="324" REF="404">
any of us; &s;o that, having no interpreter, every thing was to be conducted by &s;igns.</P>
<P>They were ho&s;pitably received, and entertained with &s;tewed fi&s;h, veni&s;on-&s;oups, and other di&s;hes, dre&s;&s;ed after the manner of the country; and the officer who now had the command, behaved with an uncommon degree of civility, or, more pro|perly, &s;ervility, by paying every attention that his circum&s;tances would admit, to make the Com|modore's &s;ituation tolerable. He had made him under&s;tand, that at the di&s;tance of about &s;ixteen wre&s;ts, at a town called Paratounka, there lived a prie&s;t, who might po&s;&s;ibly be able to conver&s;e with him; and with that view, he, the very next day, &s;ent an expre&s;s to invite him to the fort, at the &s;ame time intimating that the Governor was a German, who could talk all languages, which accounts for the omi&s;&s;ion before complained of: and indeed, as it afterwards appeared, we were expected here the preceding &s;ummer, and that our arrival was now unlooked for. On board, the carpenters were bu&s;y in &s;tripping the &s;hips bows, where they found the leak of the Re&s;olution to have been chiefly &s;eated. The larboard bow had been &s;tript of its &s;heathing, and the oakum had been wa&s;hed out. The &s;ailors were employed in getting the &s;ick on &s;hore, with every part of the &s;hips &s;tores that &s;tood in need of revi&s;al; and though the weather continued piercing cold, no time was lo&s;t in forwarding the repairs.</P>
<P>On the 4th, one of our boats, in putting the a&s;tronomer's a&s;&s;i&s;tant on &s;hore at the influx of the tide, was &s;uddenly encircled by the floating ice, in &s;uch a manner as not to be able to move one way or the other; another boat, &s;ent to her relief, was &s;oon enclo&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, and till
<PB N="325" REF="405">
the return of the tide, both were forced to remain in that deplorable &s;ituation, not a per&s;on on board daring to tru&s;t him&s;elf among the floating ice, to go to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. About twelve at night they were relea&s;ed, and the icey pri&s;oners returned on board, almo&s;t peri&s;hed with cold.</P>
<P>A &s;till wor&s;e accident happened to Lieut. King, the ingenious writer of the third volume of Cook's voyage, on his fir&s;t attempt to land; for having no clue to direct him to the village before him, in pa&s;&s;ing the trackle&s;s &s;now and ice, the ice broke under him, and for a moment he di&s;appeared. Providentially he ro&s;e again clear; and the man who attended him having a boat-hook in his hand, in&s;tantly threw it to him; he catched it, and laying it acro&s;s two pieces of ice, recovered his footing.</P>
<P>On the 5th, &s;ix gentlemen arrived from Bol|cherit&s;k, among whom was a merchant who came to trade for &s;kins; &s;ome of which he purcha&s;ed from us, as we thought, at great prices; but as we afterwards found, for little more than half their value. The&s;e are all monopolized by the Ru&s;&s;ian Company, already mentioned in our account of the la&s;t &s;ummer's voyage, and not a &s;kin is to be had from the Kam&s;hat&s;kadales. This gentleman was accompanied by the Governor's Secretary, who could &s;peak both German and Dutch, and who brought a letter from the Governor, written in German, complimenting the Commodore on his arrival, tendering his be&s;t &s;ervices, and ex|cu&s;ing his ab&s;ence; adding, at the &s;ame time, that when he was made acquainted with the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of which we &s;tood in need, he would give immediate orders for their &s;upply, as far as was in his power; and that he would embrace the fir&s;t opportunity of waiting upon the Commodore. It
<PB N="326" REF="406">
happened that Mr. Webber, our draught&s;man, was ma&s;ter of the German; and on reading the letter, it was judged more re&s;pectful, as well as more &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, for Capt. Gore, our Commander, and Lieut. King, of the Re&s;olution, to be me&s;&s;engers, as they could give a more par|ticular account of our many wants than could po&s;|&s;ibly be tran&s;mitted in a letter.</P>
<P>On the 6th the Ruffian gentlemen were enter|tained on board the &s;hips, Mr. Webber acting as interpreter to the merchant, and the governor's &s;ecretary under&s;tanding a little French, was well enough under&s;tood to make the conver&s;ation and the bottle pa&s;s jovially round. About ten at night the company parted; and,</P>
<P>In the morning of the 7th, Capt. Gore, at|tended by Lieut. King of the Re&s;olution and Mr. Webber, and accompanied by the merchant and Ruffian &s;ecretary, &s;et out for Bolcherit&s;k (Bol|cheraika &s;ays our Journali&s;t, mi&s;taking the name of the river for the name of the town) where, af|ter a mo&s;t fatiguing journey, they arrived on the 13th, and were received by Major Behm the Go|vernor, with a politene&s;s that did honour to the po&s;t he filled.</P>
<P>After the u&s;ual &s;alutations, they entered into general conver&s;ation, when our gentlemen &s;oon di&s;covered that the Major was not only a man of breeding, but of general knowledge; that he had been made acquainted by his court with our intention of touching at Kam&s;hat&s;ka; that the character of our fir&s;t Commander, Capt. Cook was known to him by the hi&s;torical relations of his former expeditions; and that the whole route, that he was &s;uppo&s;ed to pur&s;ue in the pre&s;ent ex|pedition, he had deduced from his own ob&s;erva|tions, aided by the charts and maps of which he
<PB N="327" REF="407">
was him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Capt. Gore, when he came to &s;peak of our North-we&s;t cour&s;e, put the letter into his hands, which our Commodore re|ceived from the Ruffian I&s;myloff at Samganuida, (of which notice has already been taken;) and which chiefly related to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the factory, having only &s;lightly touched upon the civilities he had received from us, and had repre&s;ented us as in|terlopers, or merchant-boats, engaged in a new line of commerce, which he apprehended might be in|jurious to that in which the factory was engaged. The Governor, however, was of too liberal a turn of mind to be at all affected by &s;uch an ill-found|ed opinion; but had he been inclined to give ear to this uncandid in&s;inuation, or to the natu|ral jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t of the Kamt&s;chat&s;ka|dales, (for they had not yet got rid of the panic with which they were &s;eized at our fir&s;t approach,) an incident had ju&s;t happened, that would have infallibly e&s;tabli&s;hed their credit. The reader will recollect, that in pa&s;&s;ing Beering's Straits, the &s;hips touched at a town on the A&s;iatic coa&s;t, inhabited by the T&s;chut&s;koi nation, a race of &s;tout hardy men, totally different from the Americans on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the Straits. This nation had hitherto maintained their independence, and had re&s;i&s;ted all the attempts of the Ruffians to reduce them The la&s;t expedition again&s;t them in 1750, terminated in the defeat of the Ruffians, who from that time had removed their frontier fortre&s;s from the Anadyr to the Ingiga, a river that empties it&s;elf into the &s;ea of Okot&s;k. From this fort, the Governor received di&s;patches the day of the arrival of our officers at Bolcherit&s;k, containing intelligence, that a tribe of the T&s;chut|&s;koi had arrived at that place with propo&s;itions of

friend&s;hip, and voluntary offer of tribute; that on enquiring into this unexpected alteration in their &s;entiments, they had informed his people, that towards the letter end of the la&s;t &s;ummer they had been vi&s;ited by two very large Ruffian boats, that they had been treated by the people who were in them with the greate&s;t kindne&s;s, and had en|tered into a league of friend&s;hip and amity with them; and that relying on this friendly di&s;po&s;i|tion, they are now come to the Ruffian fort, in order to &s;ettle a treaty on &s;uch terms as might be acceptable to both nations. This extraordi|nary hi&s;tory had occa&s;ioned much &s;peculation, both at Ingegin&s;k and Bolcherit&s;k; and had not our gentlemen furni&s;hed them with a key to it, mu&s;t have remained perfectly unintelligible: they felt, however, no &s;mall &s;atisfaction at being able to clear up the my&s;tery: with which too the Go|vernor was no le&s;s plea&s;ed than in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>By this time dinner was ready, and the gentle|men were invited to partake of what had been provided; they would have excu&s;ed them&s;elves on account of dre&s;s, but the Governor would admit no apology.</P>
<P>After dinner they took occa&s;ion to deliver to the Governor their in&s;tructions, with a li&s;t of tho&s;e articles of which the &s;hips &s;tood mo&s;t in need; repre&s;enting at the &s;ame time the &s;hattered con|dition of the &s;hips, and how much they were in want of &s;ails and cordage, as well as provi|&s;ions, having met with no &s;upply of beef or bread from the time they left England in 1776, to the pre&s;ent day; nor of tobacco, a chief article with our &s;ailors, though for three months they had been under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting without. The Governor heard him with atten|tion, and being &s;en&s;ible that the gentlemen mu&s;t be

fatigued, and de&s;irous of re&s;t, begged he might be permitted to conduct them to the hou&s;e pre|pared for their re&s;idence during their &s;tay, where they found every thing provided for them in the nice&s;t order; and a hou&s;e-keeper and cook; a &s;erjeant, two &s;entinels, and an interpreter allowed for their dome&s;tics. The&s;e civilities were accom|panied with the mo&s;t lively expre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem, at parting; and in the morning, when the gentle|men ro&s;e, they found their wi&s;hes anticipated by an order lying on their table, ready to be forward|ed to the &s;ubaltern at the fort, to &s;upply the &s;hips with the articles they mo&s;t wanted, without re|gard to their being wanted by the garri&s;on.</P>
<P>The gentlemen were not more gratified than a&s;toni&s;hed, at finding the &s;pirit of a prince in a Governor &s;ent to the remote&s;t corner of the earth to pre&s;ide over a &s;emi-barbarous people, living in a di&s;trict the mo&s;t deplorable and uncultivated; but they were &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ed, when, upon enquiring as to the price of the &s;everal articles they &s;tood in need of, they were told, that nothing more was required of them, than an atte&s;tation of tho&s;e things being received which &s;hould be in his power to furni&s;h, in ju&s;tification of his own conduct, in not having been wanting in duty to his Sovereign, who&s;e commands he had received, to exert his utmo&s;t endeavours to contribute every a&s;&s;i&s;tance to promote a de&s;ign &s;o liberally &s;et on foot by her favourite ally the King of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>And recollecting that tobacco was an article highly prized by the mariners, and not to be pur|cha&s;ed, at any price in his di&s;trict, our gentlemen, before their departure from Bolcherit&s;k, found a quantity, not le&s;s than 400 weight, depo&s;ited in their hou&s;e, <Q REND="inline">"labelled as a pre&s;ent to the &s;eamen

on board the &s;hips;"</Q> and another bag containing 20 pounds of tea, and 20 loaves of &s;ugar, as the pre&s;ent from the Governor's lady to the officers; along with the&s;e &s;he had likewi&s;e &s;ent a pre&s;ent of fre&s;h butter, honey, figs, rice, &amp;c. for Capt. Clerke, with her good wi&s;hes for the recovery of his health.</P>
<P>We &s;hould be wanting therefore in ju&s;tice to this worthy Governor, were we to pa&s;s over his behaviour to us unnoticed; which was &s;uch as did honour to his feelings as a man, and to her Imperial Maje&s;ty as an officer.</P>
<P>Our gentlemen, after being entertained in a mo&s;t magnificent manner for &s;everal days, was ac|companied in their return by the Governor him|&s;elf; who, after enforcing his orders for our im|mediate &s;upply from the country, came to &s;ee that his orders had been obeyed at the fort. He had already ordered 13,000 weight of meal to be collected from different di&s;tricts at a great di&s;|tance, and conveyed to us at whatever expence, accompanied with 20 head of horned cattle. The&s;e our &s;ailors rejoiced to &s;ee, and, though &s;ke|letons compared with tho&s;e of England, were re|ceived by us with an eagerne&s;s not ea&s;ily to be exceeded; for not having had the reli&s;h of fre&s;h beef for more than three years, the very &s;crapings of the bones would have been to our &s;ailors, at this time, a treat infinitely more grateful, than at home they would have thought the mo&s;t luxu|rious fea&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 16th, while the gentlemen were &s;till at Bolcherit&s;k, a &s;mall bullock, procured by the &s;er|jeant of the fort, was killed, and divided between the crews of both &s;hips. The &s;ame evening, John M'Into&s;h, the carpenter, mate of the Re|&s;olution died, and was decently buried, and the aged prie&s;t at Parantounka attending.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="415">It was the 23d before the Governor and officers arrived at Paratounka, in the vicinage of which the prie&s;t re&s;ided, of whom we have already &s;po|ken. With him the Governor &s;pent the after|noon, but when night came he &s;lept at the fort, if fort a mere log-hou&s;e could be called, without either gun or platform to place a gun.</P>
<P>On the 25th the pinnace from the Re&s;olution was manned, and properly equipped to bring him on board. He was &s;aluted with 13 guns from the Re&s;olution, and 11 from the Di&s;covery; and when he entered the &s;hip he was received with mu&s;ic, and with all the honours that circum|&s;tances would admit; and he was &s;o well plea&s;ed with his reception, that he &s;taid two days and two nights on board: during which time, Capt. Clerke being ill, committed the care of entertaining him to the officers with whom he was acquainted, who did not fail to make it agreeable. Some very noble pre&s;ents were made him at his departure, con&s;i&s;ting of curio&s;ities collected from every part of the world, with a gold watch, two fowling-pieces, a brace of &s;ilver-mounted pi&s;tols, and other valuable articles of Engli&s;h manufacture; to all which were added, near 100 gallons of brandy from the &s;hips &s;tores, as a pre&s;ent from the &s;ailors out of their allowance, they having, at their own reque&s;t, de&s;ired that &s;o much &s;hould be &s;pared out of their allowance for grog, in lieu of the tobacco that his Excellency had generou&s;ly ordered to be divided among&s;t them gratis; to|bacco at that time had been in &s;uch e&s;timation, that he who had been provident enough to make a re|&s;erve, &s;old it nearly at the price of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Orders were now given to get every thing on board, and prepare for &s;ailing as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible: both &s;hips had been &s;tripped of their &s;heathing
<PB N="332" REF="416">
to the water's edge, but the leak of the Di&s;co|very was found much lower, being a hole worn in her bow, which, had not the hull been cleared, could never have been come at.</P>
<P>Having now got the meal on board, the crews were &s;erved with an allowance of half rye and half flour; which, however, not being accu&s;tomed to, they did not very well reli&s;h, though it was found to be very whole&s;ome. The Governor had made Capt. Clerke a pre&s;ent of a cow, for which it was nece&s;&s;ary to provide provender; and large quantities of ducks, gee&s;e and poultry were taken on board, to &s;upply the want of other live &s;tock; for here they had no &s;heep, nor any other do|me&s;tic animal, except dogs, which &s;erve the na|tives both for hor&s;es and hunting: nor was there a cow in the country, that we &s;aw, except what the Governor &s;ent to Capt. Clerke, and one in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the prie&s;t. What was remarkable, though the &s;ea &s;eemed almo&s;t covered with wild ducks, and &s;ea-fowl of various &s;orts, they were all &s;o &s;hy, that very few were killed.</P>
<P>We had now been here a month, when,</P>
<P>On the 4th of June, being his Maje&s;ty's birth|day, the &s;ame was celebrated with great magnifi|cence on board and on &s;hore. The &s;hips were dre&s;&s;ed with &s;treamers, and with the colours of all nations, and a flag was di&s;played at the tents. The Ru&s;&s;ian gentlemen were &s;umptuou&s;ly enter|tained, on board, and the common men were &s;erved with double allowance of meat and liquor; and being permitted to divert them&s;elves on &s;hore, many of them made parties, and traver&s;ed the woods in pur&s;uit of game, with which they were told the country abounded. But, as they were ignorant of their haunts, they met with no &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="417">Before our departure, packets were entru&s;ted to the care of the Governor, to be forwarded to England by the way of Peter&s;burgh, both for go|vernment and to private friends; the&s;e we have &s;ince been informed were carefully tran&s;mitted. And now, having all things in readine&s;s, our full complement of wood and water on board, and of every nece&s;&s;ary the country afforded, and waiting only for a wind,</P>
<P>Early on the 12th of June we weighed, and &s;ailed, directing our cour&s;e to the northward; but were detained in the bay till</P>
<P>The 15th, when we were alarmed with a noi&s;e louder than the loude&s;t thunder, and pre&s;ently were almo&s;t blinded with the fall of a&s;hes, which in le&s;s than an hour, covered the decks all over from &s;tern to &s;tern, an inch thick; among which were mixed pumice-&s;tones as large as walnuts, and many &s;maller &s;tones, which &s;eemed to have received no alteration by fire. We were all dri|ven down between decks, but about ten in the morning were relea&s;ed by the &s;hower cea&s;ing. On looking round, we found they i&s;&s;ued from a vol|cano at the di&s;tance, as we &s;uppo&s;ed, of about twenty miles, then bearing from us W. S. W. During this eruption, we were not only obliged to retire our&s;elves, but to fa&s;ten down the hatches fore and aft; &s;o that what with the clo&s;ene&s;s of our confinement, and the &s;ulphureous fumes from the a&s;hes, we were almo&s;t &s;uffocated. We were therefore no &s;ooner relea&s;ed, than we weighed an|chor and &s;teered to the ea&s;tward.</P>
<P>On the 17th and 18th we continued our cour&s;e E. and E. by N.</P>
<P>On the 19th &s;teered E. by N. Lat. 54.56.</P>
<P>On the 20th came in &s;ight of land, high, and covered with &s;now, called by Beering, Kronot|&s;koi-no&s;s,
<PB N="334" REF="418">
but found that Cape a degree more to the &s;outhward than he had laid it down. Lat. 55.52.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t we continued to &s;teer E. N. E. came in &s;ight of Kamt&s;chat&s;ka-no&s;s, &s;aw a dead whale, two &s;eals, and a number of &s;ea-lions.</P>
<P>On the 22d we &s;tood to the N. E. and, &s;eeing a change in the colour of the water, we &s;ounded, but found no ground at 100 fathom. We con|tinued the &s;ame cour&s;e till the 25th, when we were in lat. 59.9. and long. 168.30. E.</P>
<P>On the 26th we changed our cour&s;e E. N. E. and finding the &s;ea covered with gulls and &s;hags, we &s;ounded, but found no ground at 120 fathom.</P>
<P>On the 27th we &s;tood E. one-half N. and found our&s;elves by ob&s;ervation in lat. 59.57. long 17. E. We changed our cour&s;e and &s;tood N. N. W.</P>
<P>On the 28th, early in the morning, we came in &s;ight of land, very high and covered with &s;now, the extreme point of which bore N. E. di&s;tance about 6 leagues. We continued our cour&s;e along &s;hore, with regular &s;oundings at about 54 fathom, free from reefs, and a very bold &s;hore. We &s;teered this cour&s;e till</P>
<P>The 30th, at noon, when we were in lat. 62.1. Thadeus's No&s;s came in &s;ight, beyond which the coa&s;t &s;eemed to &s;tretch directly North. Here it is ob&s;ervable, that on the A&s;iatic coa&s;t, the &s;ea near the &s;hore is everywhere of a convenient depth for &s;ailing; while on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore it con|tinues &s;o &s;hallow for &s;everal degrees together, as not to be navigated but with the utmo&s;t caution.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of July, the weather began to grow hazy, with thick fogs. We &s;haped our cour&s;e for the point in our chart, called T&s;chutko&s;ki-No&s;s, which with that of Thadeus, form the N. E. and S. W. points of the gulph of Anadyr.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="419">The 3d in the morning, when the fogs left us and it began to rain. At ten in the morning, &s;aw a very high point of land, bearing from us N. N. E. di&s;tance about 7 leagues. We hauled upon a wind, and &s;tood E. N. E. till two in the afternoon, when we pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall i&s;land, called by the Ru&s;&s;ians St. Nicholas; in &s;ome parts very high and covered with &s;now. Lat. 63.45. long. 187.</P>
<P>On the 4th at one in the morning, we bore away N. &frac12; E. and about noon, the next day, &s;aw land from W. to N. E. appearing like two i&s;lands. The&s;e were the i&s;lands of St. Diomede, in the mid|way between the two Continents. At four o'clock we hauled up to W. N. W. being near the Ea&s;t Cape of the A&s;iatic Continent, and &s;ounding from 26 to 29 fathom. At ten at night, the weather being clear, we had an opportunity of &s;eeing the remarkable peeked hill near Cape Prince of Wales, on the American &s;ide, and the Ea&s;t Cape of A&s;ia, with the two connecting i&s;lands of St. Diomede between them.</P>
<P>On the 6th we continued coa&s;ting from N. &frac12; W. to N. &frac12; E. with the land to the we&s;tward high and &s;nowy. Lat. 67.10. long. 191. E.</P>
<P>On the 7th, &s;aw ice in a large body to the ea&s;t|ward, di&s;tance about 2 or 3 leagues, and about noon pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal large ma&s;&s;es of ice. We tacked and &s;tood N. W. by W. with a &s;tiff gale and heavy &s;now.</P>
<P>On the 8th fell in with the ice again in a &s;olid body; at the &s;ame time bore away S. S. W.</P>
<P>On the 9th, at three in the morning, we hauled up along &s;ide the &s;olid ice, freezing cold all day. Lat. 69.12.</P>
<P>On the 10th continued our cour&s;e all the morn|ing, and at nine pa&s;&s;ed a large field of loo&s;e ice,
<PB N="336" REF="420">
di&s;tance about three miles, and at noon went through it.</P>
<P>On the 11th we found our&s;elves &s;urrounded with ice. We kept working to the S. E. pa&s;&s;ing many large fields of ice, covered with &s;ea-cows. We kept luffing up and bearing away, till with &s;ome difficulty we got through. Lat. by ob&s;er|vation 67.40. long. 188.40. We continued working through the ice till</P>
<P>The 14th, when by ob&s;ervation we were in lat. 69.37. We continued bearing away to the northward, till</P>
<P>The 18th, when by ob&s;ervation we were in lat. 70.28. long. 194.54. and being very near the ice, a large white bear pa&s;&s;ed us in the water, but made for the ice at a great rate. In half an hour, we &s;aw multitudes of them upon the ice, making to the ea&s;tward, when we ob&s;erved the &s;ea-cows, as the bears approached them, flying like &s;heep pur&s;ued by dogs.</P>
<P>On the 20th we came in &s;ight of land at the di&s;tance of about 5 or 6 leagues, bearing from S. to S. E. &s;ounded from 24 to 21 fathom. Our cour&s;e being W. &frac12; S. all the morning, at 3 P. M. we al|tered it, and &s;tood to the &s;outhward and we&s;tward. This day the crew of the Re&s;olution had the good fortune to fall in with two large white bears, and to kill them both, the two fore tu&s;ks of the large&s;t weighed 436lb.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t we &s;tood from W. &frac12; N. to W. N. W. and at &s;ix o'clock we pa&s;&s;ed a large i&s;land of ice, on which were whole herds of &s;ea-cows of an enormous &s;ize. We fired &s;everal mu&s;kets among them, which &s;ent them to the water with dreadful yellings. At nine in the evening we came in &s;ight of the American &s;hore, di&s;tant about &s;ix leagues. We &s;teered all night W. by N. and next
<PB N="337" REF="421">
morning found our&s;elves almo&s;t &s;urrounded with fields of ice drifting to the &s;outhward. At twelve o'clock we hauled our wind to the &s;outhward, and, by the alertne&s;s of our &s;eamen, we pa&s;&s;ed them with very little damage.</P>
<P>On the 22d, about two A M. we again &s;tood S. S. W. but at &s;ix &s;aw the ice all round us from S. E. to N. W. hauled our wind upon our larboard tack, and &s;tood S. S. E. We were all this day luffing up and bearing away to avoid the ice, which was on every &s;ide in &s;ight, in many frightful &s;hapes.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 23d it came on to blow very hard, and, before noon, we found our&s;elves clo&s;ely blocked up in the ice, and could &s;ee it all round us in a &s;olid body, to a great di&s;tance. At the &s;ame time we &s;aw the Re&s;olution bearing N. E. &frac12; E. &s;ome miles off, which was the la&s;t &s;ight we had of her during the whole day. In this horrid &s;ituation we handed all our &s;ails, unbent our fore-top-&s;ail, and moored &s;hip with both our ice anchors, one to each bow.</P>
<P>We now began to reflect on our condition; the winter drawing on apace; our provi&s;ions &s;hort, and what we had but very indifferent, and no re|lief to be expected; our people's &s;pirits began to &s;ink, and it was with difficulty that they were per|&s;uaded to exert them&s;elves for their own deliver|ance. Fortunately for us, we had, in the evening, a &s;hift of wind from W. N. W. with a &s;teady breeze, when our Captain, looking over our &s;tar|board quarter, di&s;cerned the ice to the &s;outhward, &s;eemingly to leave the &s;hip, and &s;oon heard a cra&s;h, as if a thou&s;and rocks had been rent from their foundations; which we afterwards perceived to be the parting of the ice in different directions, and &s;oon after found our&s;elves relea&s;ed. We in|&s;tantly
<PB N="338" REF="422">
got up our ice-anchors, and &s;haped our cour&s;e from S. E. to E. S. E. but were frequently &s;topped by large pieces, which carried away great part of our &s;heathing forward, and damaged our &s;tern, &s;o that the &s;hip made water at the rate of three inches and a half an hour; and at the &s;ame time had 37 inches in her well.</P>
<P>On the 24th we continued our cour&s;e E. S. E. and came in fight of the Re&s;olution, which had likewi&s;e received much damage about her bows. We were now clear of the ice, and, till three in the afternoon, &s;ailed in company, till we came up with a &s;olid body of ice, on which we &s;aw a num|ber of amphibious animals, &s;ome of them very large. We in&s;tantly got out and manned our boats, and in three hours returned with eleven of the large&s;t, about which all hands were employed the next day in &s;kinning and cutting them up for blubber.</P>
<P>On the 25th we pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal fields of ice. We &s;teered N. E. one-half E. and at noon was at the extreme of the ea&s;ternmo&s;t land in &s;ight, being then in lat. 69.12. and, by lunar ob&s;er|vation, in long. 187.16. Ea&s;t of London. It was now exce&s;&s;ive cold; the &s;now froze as it fell. The blocks were choaked up, and the ropes increa&s;ed by the fro&s;t to double their real &s;ize. In this con|dition it is ea&s;y to conceive, the fatigues to which the poor &s;ailors were expo&s;ed; yet by a little en|couragement, increa&s;ing their allowance of grog, and giving them plenty of provi&s;ions, they con|tinued their labour with cheerfulne&s;s and a&s;toni&s;h|ing per&s;everance.</P>
<P>On the 27th we found our&s;elves involved again among the loo&s;e ice, &s;ome of which it was out of our power to e&s;cape; and the leak &s;till continuing rather to increa&s;e than abate, our Captain, with
<PB N="339" REF="423">
Mr. Bailey the a&s;tronomer, and Mr. Burney, our fir&s;t Lieutenant, went on board the Re&s;olution, to report our &s;ituation to the Commodore, whom they found &s;o ill as to be pa&s;t all hopes of reco|very. Upon calling a council of officers, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that we &s;hould proceed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to &s;ome port, where we might repair our damages, and Kam&s;hat&s;ka was appointed our place of rendezvous. We were now in lat. 68.10. and in long. 188. &s;haping our cour&s;e S. E. with a light breeze from W. S. W.</P>
<P>On the 28th, at two in the morning we came in &s;ight of the A&s;iatic &s;hore, very high and covered with &s;now, di&s;tance about 7 or 8 leagues, we made &s;ail and &s;tood to the &s;outhward. About noon we found our&s;elves in lat. 67.11. by double altitudes, and in long. 188.10. E. the extreme of the ea&s;t|ernmo&s;t end of the ice di&s;tant about 6 leagues. At ten at night we &s;aw a great number of ducks, gee&s;e, and &s;ea-parrots very near us, by which we judged land could not be far off.</P>
<P>On the 29th at noon we were in lat. 66.50. and long. 188.27. but no land in &s;ight.</P>
<P>On the 30th we &s;teered till noon to the S. E. with a &s;teady breeze, and came in &s;ight of two i&s;lands right a-head, di&s;tant about five or &s;ix leagues. The weather then became thick and hazy, and though we were certain that the main land of A&s;ia and America were at no great di&s;|tance, we could &s;ee neither till about four o'clock in the afternoon; when the weather clearing up, we &s;aw a pa&s;&s;age or &s;treight, to which we bore away, and found the two continents at &s;even o'clock on each &s;ide of us. Lat. 66. thirteen leagues a&s;under, beyond which they diverge to N. E. by E. and W. N. W. &s;o as, in lat. 69. to be 300 miles a&s;under. This &s;treight we called

North &s;treight, the entrance of which we found the &s;ame as has been already de&s;cribed; and the current at this time &s;etting to the N.

W. and continued the &s;ame the whole night, &s;ounding from 22 to 26 fathom, grey &s;and and &s;mall &s;hells.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t we pa&s;&s;ed T&s;chutu&s;koi-no&s;s, called by the &s;ailors Tu&s;kan-no&s;s, and &s;oon came in &s;ight of Cook's town, which we vi&s;ited the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on, as has already been mentioned, and which we now pa&s;&s;ed with regret.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t we were in lat. 64.23. long. 189.15. the coa&s;t of A&s;ia extending from N. W. by W. di&s;tant about 12 leagues.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable till Augu&s;t the 5th, when we had an ob&s;ervation, and found our&s;elves in lat. 63.37.</P>

At four o'clock having a dead calm, the companies of both &s;hips em|ployed them&s;elves in fi&s;hing, and very fortunately caught a great number of large cod, which were equally di&s;tributed among the crews. To this place we gave the name of the bank of Good Pro|vidence; and as &s;oon as the breeze &s;prung up, we made &s;ail and &s;tood to S. W.</P>
<P>On the 9th at noon, we were by ob&s;ervation in lat. 57. and long. 183.36.14. The weather being more moderate than it had been for &s;everal days, the &s;ignal was made to &s;peak with the Re&s;olution, when on enquiry, we were informed that the Captain was pa&s;t recovery, and that the crew be|gan to grow &s;ickly.

<P>On the 15th being in &s;oundings, and the wea|ther calm, we hove to, in order to get &s;ome fi&s;h for the &s;ick, and a few cod were caught and &s;ent on board the Re&s;olution to be di&s;tributed ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>On the 17th the wind that had been again&s;t us for &s;ome days pa&s;t &s;hifted in our favour; and at nine in the morning the man at the ma&s;t-head called out land to the N. W. which was found to be the i&s;land of Mednor, laid down to the S. E. of Beering I&s;land, lat. at noon. 54.50.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable till the 21&s;t, when early in the morning the man at the ma&s;t-head again came in &s;ight of land. It was then at a very great di&s;tance, and upon our &s;tarboard bow, but before night we were only di&s;tant from the mouth of Kam&s;hat&s;ka bay, 12 or 13 leagues.</P>
<P>On the 22d at nine in the morning we had the Re&s;olution's boat on board, to acquaint our Cap|tain with the death of our Commodore. We were then within &s;ight of the flag, at the mouth of Kam&s;hat&s;ka-bay, of which mention has already been made; and the wind being favourable, we continued our cour&s;e for the entrance of the har|bour, which then bore from us W. S. W. lat. at noon 52.24.</P>
<P>On the 23d a little before midnight, we came to anchor within the light-hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="426">On the 24th our Captain, being now Commo|dore, made the &s;ignal to get under way by tow|ing; all the boats were accordingly got out, and the Commodore went on board the Re&s;olution, where it was re&s;olved, for the greater convenience of repairing the &s;hips, and for erecting the tents and forge, to go within the upper harbour. And about four in the afternoon both &s;hips came to, and were moored in three fathom and a half wa|ter, muddy bottom.</P>
<P>The old &s;erjeant, who &s;till commanded at the fort, came with a pre&s;ent of berries for Capt. Clerke. He &s;eemed much affected when he was &s;hewn his coffin, and was told it was his particular de&s;ire to be buried on &s;hore.</P>
<P>Early next morning the tents were erected, and the &s;ick were put on &s;hore.</P>
<P>From the time we &s;et &s;ail out of this bay in June, till the pre&s;ent day, we had been in no har|bour to refit; and had been driven from i&s;land to i&s;land among the ice, till our &s;hips had in a man|ner lo&s;t their &s;heathing, and were otherwi&s;e in a &s;hattered condition; we were therefore happy in arriving &s;afe.</P>
<P>Augu&s;t 25th, an expre&s;s was &s;ent to Bolcherit&s;k, to acquaint the new governor, Capt. Shmaleff, with our arrival, and with the death of our late Commander, at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting a fre&s;h &s;upply of cattle. Another expre&s;s was &s;ent to Paratounka, to de&s;ire the attendance of the prie&s;t, in order to con&s;ult with him concerning the interment of Capt. Clerke, who&s;e de&s;ire was, to be buried in his church. While we were wait|ing the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e me&s;&s;ages, the &s;everal pro|motions took place that followed in con&s;equence of the Commander's death. Mr. Gore went on board the Re&s;olution, and Mr. King, fir&s;t Lieut.
<PB N="343" REF="427">
of the Re&s;olution, took the command of the Di&s;covery. Other promotions took place, which the reader will remark by the &s;equel. The fir&s;t care of the commanders of both &s;hips was to provide for the recovery of the &s;ick, and the repairs of the &s;hips; and for that purpo&s;e a hou&s;e was procured for the reception of the for|mer, and a contrivance made for having the latter dry.</P>
<P>The weather being now temperate and the coun|try delightful, the officers and gentlemen cho&s;e to &s;leep in their marquees on &s;hore. It was how|ever thought expedient to &s;hew every mark of re&s;pect to the Ru&s;&s;ian officers, who, though not of the fir&s;t rank, were notwith&s;tanding the only people with whom we had any concern, or with whom we could have any communication; they were therefore frequently invited to dinner, and they often attended.</P>
<P>On the 26th the prie&s;t arrived, when Capt. Gore acquainted him with the death of our com|mander, and of his de&s;ire to be buried in his church. The good old gentleman &s;eemed much concerned, but &s;tarted &s;everal difficulties, and appeared very unwilling to comply with the dy|ing reque&s;t of the decea&s;ed. He urged &s;everal rea&s;ons to &s;hew the impropriety of it; tho&s;e of mo&s;t weight were, that the church was &s;oon to be pulled down; that it was every winter three feet deep in water; and that in a few years no ve&s;tige of it would remain, as the new church was to be erected near the town of Awat&s;ka, upon a drier and more convenient &s;pot. He therefore advi&s;ed the remains of the Comman|der to be depo&s;ited at the foot of a tree, the &s;cite of which was to be included in the body of the new church, where the Captain's bones might
<PB N="344" REF="428">
probably re&s;t for ages undi&s;turbed. The&s;e rea|&s;ons, whether real or fictitious, the officers who had charge of the funeral could not di&s;prove, and therefore people were &s;ent to dig the grave where the prie&s;t &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>All hands were now bu&s;y at work on their dif|ferent employments. The Di&s;covery, on being examined, was found to be in a mo&s;t wretched condition; many of her timbers beneath the wale &s;haken, and &s;ome of her planks rotten, and for want of others to &s;upply their places, were forced to be &s;hifted.</P>
<P>The 29th was appointed for the interment; and to make the funeral the more &s;olemn, every officer was de&s;ired to appear in his uniform; the marines to be drawn up under arms, and the com|mon men to be dre&s;&s;ed as nearly alike as po&s;&s;ible, in order to attend the corp&s;e from the water-&s;ide to the grave. All this was readily complied with, and the proce&s;&s;ion began about ten in the morn|ing, when minute guns from the &s;hips were fired, and the drums, muffled as u&s;ual, beat the dead march. When the corp&s;e arrived at the grave, it was depo&s;ited under the triple di&s;charge of the marines; and, the grave being covered, it was fenced in by piles driven deep in the ground, and the in&s;ide afterwards filled up with &s;tones and earth, to pre&s;erve the body from being devoured in the winter by bears or other wild bea&s;ts, who are remarkable for their &s;agacity in &s;centing out the bodies of dead pa&s;&s;engers, when they happen to peri&s;h and are buried near the roads.</P>
<P>This ceremony over, an e&s;cutcheon was pre|pared and neatly painted by Mr. Webber, with the Captain's coat of arms properly emblazon'd, and placed in the church of Paratounka, and un|derneath the following in&s;cription:
<Q><PB N="345" REF="429">
<P>There lies interred at the Foot of a Tree,<LB>near the O&s;trog of St. PETER, and PAUL,<LB>The BODY of<LB>CHARLES CLERKE, ESQUIRE,<LB>COMMANDER of his Britannic Maje&s;ty's<LB>Ships the Re&s;olution and Di&s;covery;<LB>To which he &s;ucceeded on the Death of<LB>JAMES COOK, E&s;quire,<LB>Who was killed by the Natives of an I&s;land he<LB>di&s;covered in the South Sea, after having ex<LB>plored the Coa&s;t of America, from 42 deg.<LB>27 min. to 70 deg. 40 min. 57 &s;ec.

<P><PB N="346" REF="430">Another in&s;cription was fixed upon the tree under which he was interred. This tree was at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town, and near the ho&s;|pital, round which &s;everal people had already been buried; but none &s;o high upon the hill as the &s;pot pointed out for the grave of Capt. Clerke. The in&s;cription placed on this tree was nearly the &s;ame as that in the church of Paratounka, and was as follows:
<Q><P>Beneath this Tree lies the BODY of<LB>CAPTAIN CHARLES CLERKE,<LB>COMMANDER of his Britannic Maje&s;ty's<LB>Ships the Re&s;olution and Di&s;covery,<LB>Which Command he &s;ucceeded to on the 14th<LB>of February, 1779, on the Death of<LB>Captain JAMES COOK,<LB>Who was killed by the Natives of &s;ome<LB>I&s;lands he di&s;covered in the SOUTH<LB>SEA, on the Date above.</P>

<P><PB N="347" REF="431">On this occa&s;ion the inhabitants of both towns, and tho&s;e of the whole country for many miles round, attended; and the crews of both &s;hips were &s;uffered to continue a&s;hore, and to divert them&s;elves, each as he liked be&s;t. It was the Captain's de&s;ire that they &s;hould have double allowance for three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and all that while to be excu&s;ed from other duty than what the ordinary attendance in the &s;hips required; but the &s;ea&s;on being far advanced, and a long track of unknown &s;ea to pa&s;s before we could reach China, the officers repre&s;enting the hard&s;hips and inconveniencies that &s;o much lo&s;t time might bring upon them&s;elves, they very readily gave up that part of the Captain's beque&s;t, and re|turned to their re&s;pective employments early the next day.</P>
<P>On the 4th of September, an En&s;ign arrived with a letter from the Governor to Capt. Gore, acquainting him, that orders had been given a|bout the cattle; that the bearer was to remain, to take care that nothing &s;hould be wanted that the garri&s;on could &s;upply; and that on the arrival of a &s;loop from Okotzk, which was daily expected, he would him&s;elf &s;upply his place.</P>
<P>The En&s;ign farther informed Capt. Gore, that the &s;loop was laden with provi&s;ions and &s;tores of all &s;orts for the u&s;e of the &s;hips; but expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome apprehen&s;ions for her &s;afety, as the boats had been looking out for her &s;everal days. This news was of too much importance to be &s;lighted. Accordingly,</P>
<P>On the 3d the pinnaces and beats from both &s;hips were &s;ent to the entrance of the bay, to a&s;&s;i&s;t, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould be in &s;ight, in towing her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> but it was</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="432">The 11th before &s;he arrived. She was a bark of about 80 tons, and had two guns mounted, which &s;he fired as a &s;alute, when &s;he dropt an|chor, and was an&s;wered by a volley from the gar|ri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted of a &s;ubaltern and twenty-five &s;oldiers. She was no &s;ooner moored, than we received a vi&s;it from a Put-parochich, or Sub-Lieutenant, who was to take the command of the fort. He was introduced to the Commodore, to whom he delivered the invoice of his lading; among which were wearing apparel and tobacco, two articles that were above all others acceptable to the &s;hips companies.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Lieutenant had executed his commi&s;&s;ion, and delivered up the &s;tores to the Commodore, he took his leave, and returned to Bolcherit&s;k; and the &s;hips being lightened afore, and their bows heaved up dry, &s;o that the car|penters could get at the leaks, the Captains and principal officers finding little el&s;e to amu&s;e them, made a party to &s;cour the woods for game; but this proved the wor&s;t &s;ea&s;on in the year for hunting. They had been told, that rein-deer, wolves, foxes, beavers, and &s;tone-rams, every where abounded in the fore&s;ts of this country; and they had promi&s;ed them&s;elves great &s;port in pur&s;uing them; but after &s;taying out full two days and nights, during which time they had been expo&s;ed to &s;everal &s;evere &s;torms, they re|turned much fatigued, without having been able to kill a &s;ingle creature. The parties who had been &s;ent out to wood and water had &s;ucceeded much better. As &s;oon as the &s;hips were ready to launch, they were ready to compleat the hold. In &s;hort, the utmo&s;t di&s;patch was made to ha&s;ten our de|parture, &s;o that by the latter end of September
<PB N="349" REF="433">
we were in readine&s;s to put to &s;ea. The cattle with which we were now &s;upplied, one would have thought, had dropt from another region, It is among the wonders of nature, with what celerity every vegetable and every animal changes its appearance in this climate.</P>
<P>On the 12th of June, when we left the harbour of Kam&s;hat&s;ka, the &s;pring had but ju&s;t begun to announce the approach of &s;ummer, by the bud|ding of the trees, and the &s;pringing of the gra&s;s; but now, on our return, it was matter of &s;urprize to find the fruits ripe, and the harve&s;t in full perfection. The cattle were mere &s;kin and bone, which we were glad to accept at fir&s;t coming; but tho&s;e that were now &s;ent us were fine and fat, and would have made no bad figure in Smithfield-market. The gra&s;s was in many places as high as our knees, and the corn, where any grew, bore the promi&s;ing appearance of a fine crop. In &s;hort, from the mo&s;t dreary, barren, and de&s;olate a&s;pect, that any habitable country could pre&s;ent, this was become one of the mo&s;t delightful. Mr. Nel&s;on reaped a rich harve&s;t of rare plants, and had the additional plea&s;ure of gathering them in their mo&s;t exalted &s;tate.</P>
<P>In this interval of idle time, between compleat|ing our repairs and clearing the harbour, we had lei&s;ure to take a view of the town near the &s;hore, where we fir&s;t moored, and that of Paratounka, where the prie&s;t lived, and where the church was &s;ituated. The&s;e towns have received &s;ome im|provement &s;ince they became &s;ubject to the Ru&s;+&s;ians, but are &s;till mo&s;t wretched dwellings. The hou&s;es are built (if we may call that building, which is half dug out of the earth, and half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> upon poles) in two different forms, one for their
<PB N="350" REF="434">
&s;ummer, and the other for their winter re&s;i|dence.</P>
<P>Their winter habitation is made by digging a &s;quare hole in the earth, about five or &s;ix feet deep, the length and breadth being proportioned to the number of people that are to live in it. At each corner of this &s;quare hole they &s;et up a thick po&s;t, and in the intermediate &s;pace between the&s;e corner po&s;ts, they place other po&s;ts at cer|tain di&s;tances, and over the&s;e they lay balks, fa&s;tening them together with &s;trong cords, which they make of nettles prepared in the manner of hemp. Acro&s;s the&s;e they place other balks, in the manner of a bridge, then cover the whole with thatch, leaving a &s;quare opening in the middle, which &s;erves at once for door, window, and chimney. On one &s;ide of this &s;quare is their fire-place, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide is ranged their kitchen-furniture. On the two other &s;ides are a kind of broad benches made with earth, on which each family lie, and in one of the&s;e huts or hou&s;es there live &s;everal families. To enter the&s;e huts by the only opening at top, they u&s;e a ladder, not made with rounds between two &s;ides, like ours, but con&s;i&s;ting only of narrow &s;lips of wood fa&s;tened to a plank. This ladder the women mount with great agility, with children at their backs; and though the &s;moke would blind and &s;uffocate tho&s;e who are not u&s;ed to it, yet the Kam&s;hat&s;kadales find no inconvenience from it.</P>
<P>Their &s;ummer huts, called balagans, are made by fixing up po&s;ts about fourteen feet above ground, and laying balks over them as before. On the&s;e they make a floor, and then rai&s;e a roof, which they thatch with gra&s;s. To the&s;e balagans they have two doors, which they a&s;cend by the &s;ame kind of ladder.</P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="435">In the winter they u&s;e the balagans for maga|zines, the thatch &s;ecures what they lay up in them from rain, and by taking away the ladder, it be|comes inacce&s;&s;ible to wild bea&s;ts and vermin.</P>
<P>It being &s;ummer, we had no acce&s;s to their winter dwellings, which were all &s;hut up, and they were not over fond of expo&s;ing their poverty; for though they have little to boa&s;t of, they are not without pride. The whole furniture of the commonality con&s;i&s;ts of di&s;hes, bowls, troughs, and cans; their cans are made of birch bark, their other uten&s;ils of wood, which till the Ru&s;&s;ians in|troduced iron among them, they hollowed with in&s;truments made of &s;tone or bone; but with the&s;e tools their work was tedious and difficult. In the&s;e bowls they dre&s;s their food, though, be|ing wood, they will not bear the fire.</P>
<P>In the winter the men are employed in hunting, making &s;ledges, and fetching wood; and the wo|men in weaving nets, and &s;pinning thread.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring the rivers begin to thaw, and the fi&s;h that wintered in them to go towards the &s;ea; the men therefore in this &s;ea&s;on are bu&s;ied in fi&s;hing, and the women in curing what they catch.</P>
<P>They chiefly catch the &s;almon, which are very plenty and very delicious, by &s;pearing, at which they are as aukward as at &s;hooting.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer the men build both their winter and &s;ummer huts, train their dogs, and make their hou&s;hold uten&s;ils and warlike in&s;truments; but the women make all the clothing, even to the &s;hoes. Their clothes, for the mo&s;t part, are made of the &s;kins of land and &s;ea-animals, parti|cularly deer, dogs, and &s;eals; but &s;ometimes they u&s;e the &s;kins of birds, and frequently tho&s;e of dif|ferent animals in the &s;ame garments. They com|monly
<PB N="352" REF="436">
wear two coats; the under one with the hair inwards, and the upper one with the hair out|wards. The women have be&s;ides, an under gar|ment, not unlike Dutch trow&s;ers, divided and drawn round the knees with &s;trings.</P>
<P>They are filthy beyond imagination. They never wa&s;h their hands or faces, nor pare their nails. They eat out of the &s;ame di&s;h with the dogs, which they never wa&s;h. Both men and women plait their hair in two locks, which they never comb; and tho&s;e who have &s;hort hair, &s;upply the locks with fal&s;e. This is &s;aid of the Kam&s;hat&s;ka|dales, who live more to the North; tho&s;e in the towns which we &s;aw, had learnt of the Ru&s;&s;ians to be more cleanly.</P>
<P>They are very &s;uper&s;titious: and the women in particular pretend to avert misfortunes, cure di&s;|ea&s;es, and foretel future events, by muttering in|cantations over the fins of fi&s;hes, mingled with a certain herb, which they gather from the woods with much labour. They pretend al&s;o to judge of good and bad fortune, by the lines of the hands, and by their dreams, which they relate to each other as &s;oon as they awake. They dread going near the burning mountains, le&s;t the invi&s;ible beings that inhabit them &s;hould hurt them; and think it a &s;in to drink or to bathe in the hot &s;prings, with which their country abounds, becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e tho&s;e &s;prings to be heated by the evil &s;pirits that produce them. They are &s;aid never to bury their dead; but, binding a &s;trap round the neck of the corp&s;e, drag it to the next fore&s;t, where they leave it to be eaten by the bears, wolves, or other wild inhabitants. They have a notion that they who are eaten with dogs will drive with fine dogs in another world. They throw away all the
<PB N="353" REF="437">
clothes of the decea&s;ed, becau&s;e they believe that they who wear them will die before their time.</P>
<P>The country is &s;aid to abound with wild bea&s;ts, which con&s;titute the principal riches of the inha|bitants; particularly foxes, &s;ables, &s;tone-foxes, and hares, marmots, ermins, wea&s;les, bears, wolves, rein-deer, and &s;tone-rams; but our gentlemen were much di&s;appointed, who went in pur&s;uit of them. The only game they killed was a &s;he-bear, though they diverted them&s;elves in hunting with the natives for &s;everal days: nor were they much more &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;hooting; even the &s;ea-fowl were hardly to be come at, they were &s;o watchful. They have a &s;pecies of wea&s;le, called the glutton, who&s;e fur is &s;o much more e&s;teemed than all others, that they &s;ay the good &s;pirits are clothed with it. The paws of this animal are white as &s;now, but the hair of the body is yellow. Sixty rubles (about 12 guineas nearly) have been given for a &s;kin, and a &s;ea-beaver for a &s;ingle paw.</P>
<P>Of the bears, the inhabitants make good u&s;e; of their &s;kins they make their beds, coverings, caps, collars, and gloves; and of their fle&s;h and fat, their mo&s;t delicious food; but their manner of hunting them, is attended with much danger and little profit. They watch their haunts, and follow their tracks to the lakes where they re&s;ort. They then choo&s;e &s;ome convenient place to con|ceal them&s;elves, to be in readine&s;s to watch their prey. They then plant their re&s;ts (for no Kamt|&s;hat&s;kadale ever &s;hoots without a re&s;t) and when the bear comes within di&s;tance, they point their guns, and let fly. If they kill or maim, &s;o that the bear cannot pur&s;ue, 'tis well; but if they mi&s;s, as they frequently do, 'tis happy for the hunter if he e&s;capes. The enraged bea&s;t makes at the place whence the report is heard, and, if
<PB N="354" REF="438">
not received on the hunter's &s;pear, which he al|ways has in re&s;erve, the combat becomes &s;o un|equal, that the bear is generally the conqueror.</P>
<P>The Kam&s;hat&s;kadales, all along the Northern coa&s;ts, have a particular manner of dre&s;&s;ing their food, which is the very rever&s;e of that of the In|dians in the South. There they roa&s;t or &s;tew with &s;tones made hot and buried, as it were, in the earth with their meat, by which its reli&s;h is &s;aid to be much improved. But here they boil it with hot &s;tones immer&s;ed in water, by which its flavour is rendered more in&s;ipid. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity, however, &s;eems to have pointed out the &s;ame means to the people of the torrid and the frigid zones; for both being equally unacquainted with iron, and wood being incapable of re&s;i&s;ting fire, when brought in contact with it, though the prin|ciple was obvious, the application was difficult; tho&s;e, therefore, of the torrid zone, would natu|rally be led to call the warmth of the earth to their aid; whil&s;t tho&s;e in the frozen climates, would think water a more ready a&s;&s;i&s;tant: add to this, that the colder regions abound with hot &s;prings; &s;ome in Kam&s;hat&s;ka, in particular, are &s;o hot, as to approach nearly to the degree of boiling water; but the&s;e they think it &s;inful to u&s;e, as we have al|ready ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The dogs of this country are like our village curs, and are of different colours. They feed chiefly on fi&s;h; and their ma&s;ters u&s;e them, in&s;tead of hor&s;es or rein-deer, to draw &s;ledges.</P>
<P>The &s;eas and lakes abound with a variety of amphibious animals, of which &s;eals and &s;ea-hor&s;es and &s;ea-cows, are the mo&s;t numerous and the mo&s;t profitable. Of the &s;kins of the &s;eal they make their canoes, and on their fle&s;h and fat they feed
<PB N="355" REF="439">
deliciou&s;ly. Whales are &s;ometimes ca&s;t upon the &s;hores, but very &s;eldom, unle&s;s wounded.</P>
<P>With the teeth and bones of the &s;ea-hor&s;e and &s;ea-cow, they point their arrows and weapons of war; and of their fat and blubber they make their oil. They have otters in their lakes, but their &s;kins bear a great price.</P>
<P>They have birds of various kinds in great abun|dance. Among the &s;ea-fowl, they have the puffin, the &s;ea-crow, the Greenland pigeon, and the cor|morant. They have &s;wans, gee&s;e, and eleven &s;pecies of ducks; and they have plovers, &s;nipes, and &s;mall birds without number. They have likewi&s;e four kinds of eagles; the black eagle, with a white head; the white eagle; the &s;potted eagle, and the brown eagle. They have vultures al&s;o, and hawks innumerable.</P>
<P>This country &s;warms with in&s;ects in the &s;um|mer, which are very trouble&s;ome; but they have neither frog, toad, nor &s;erpent. Lizards are not rare; but they believe the&s;e creatures to be &s;pies, &s;ent from the infernal powers to in&s;pect their lives and foretel their deaths; and therefore whenever they &s;ee one, they kill it, and cut it into &s;mall pieces, that it may not carry back any intelligence to their hurt.</P>
<P>But what is mo&s;t remarkable, and de&s;erves the attention of the curious, is the general conformity between the Kam&s;hat&s;kadales towards the Ea&s;t, and of the Americans, that live on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, ju&s;t over again&s;t them, in their per&s;ons, ha|bits, cu&s;toms, and food; both dre&s;s exactly in the &s;ame manner; both cut holes in their faces in the manner already de&s;cribed, in which they put bones like fal&s;e teeth, by way of ornament; and both make their canoes exactly on the &s;ame con|&s;truction. The&s;e are about twelve feet long and two

broad, &s;harp at the head and &s;tern, and flat at the bottom; they con&s;i&s;t of flat pieces of wood, joined at both ends, and kept apart in the middle by a tran&s;ver&s;e piece, through which there is a round hole, ju&s;t large enough for the man to in&s;ert his legs, and to &s;eat him&s;elf on a bench made on pur|po&s;e; this &s;keleton is covered with &s;eal-&s;kin, dyed of a kind of purple colour, and the whole is &s;kirted with loo&s;e &s;kin, which, when the man is &s;eated, he draws clo&s;e round him, like the mouth of a pur&s;e; and, with a coat and a cap of the &s;ame &s;kin, which covers his whole body, makes the man and his boat appear like one piece; and thus clad, and thus &s;eated and &s;urrounded, he fears neither the roughe&s;t &s;ea, nor the &s;evere&s;t weather. But here it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h between the native Kam&s;hat&s;kadales and the Ru&s;|&s;ians who live at Kamt&s;hat&s;ka, who pre&s;erve the Ru&s;&s;ian language and the Ru&s;&s;ian manners.</P>
<P>And now we have had occa&s;ion to mention this &s;imiliarity between the inhabitants on the oppo&s;ite &s;hores of A&s;ia and America, we &s;hall em|brace this opportunity to correct a very material error in our account of our la&s;t year's voyage, where, &s;peaking of the Ru&s;&s;ian Di&s;coveries, we took notice, after examining Beering's Straits, though the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;uppo&s;ed that the lands were parted, here we found the continent to join, by which the Reader will, no doubt, imagine, that we have a&s;&s;erted, that the two continents of A&s;ia and America join, which they do not; but are &s;e|parated by a &s;trait between two promontories, which in clear weather are &s;o near as to be &s;een in &s;ailing through with the naked eye. But what is meant is this. When Beering made his di&s;|covery, in coa&s;ting along the American &s;hore, he di&s;covered a &s;ound or &s;trait, which having &s;ur|mounted,
<PB N="357" REF="441">
he found him&s;elf in a great bay, which he imagined was another &s;ea; and that the land which he had pa&s;&s;ed was not the American con|tinent, but a great i&s;land &s;eparated from the con|tinent by the &s;ound or &s;trait ju&s;t mentioned. This &s;ound therefore, and this bay, we examined; and &s;ound that what the Ru&s;&s;ians had mi&s;taken for an i&s;land, is actually a part of the American conti|nent. Hence it appears, that notwith&s;tanding all that was written again&s;t it, Beering is ju&s;tly en|titled to the honour of having di&s;covered all that part of the N. W. continent of America that has been hitherto marked in our maps as parts un|known.</P>
<P>It remains now only to give a &s;hort de&s;cription of the bay and harbour where we repaired, which at the entrance is between two very high bluff rocks. On the &s;tarboard as we enter is the light-hou&s;e, of which mention has already been made; and at the di&s;tance of about twenty miles the vol|cano, from whence flames and a&s;hes are &s;ometimes emitted; and the&s;e eruptions are carried by the wind to a great di&s;tance, and to the great terror of the inhabitants. The bay is about eight leagues deep, and lies from S. E. to N. W. and from N. E. to S. W. it is about four leagues. It is in|acce&s;&s;ible during the winter, by rea&s;on of the ice, but very &s;afe and convenient during the &s;ummer. There are in it three excellent harbours.</P>
<P>The harbour where we lay to careen and re|pair, would contain about twenty &s;hips of the line in perfect &s;afety, being clo&s;ely &s;urrounded with high hills, except at the entrance. The people are civil, and in their way very obliging; but their manner of living affords nothing very enchanting for &s;ailors.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="442">Our &s;hips being now in as good repair as we had rea&s;on to expect from the length of the voy|age they had pa&s;&s;ed, the rigorous weather to which they had been expo&s;ed, the boi&s;terous &s;eas they had &s;hipped, and, above all, from the violent con|cu&s;&s;ions of the ice that had &s;haken their very frames, and had &s;tript them of their &s;heathing: and being likewi&s;e plentifully provided with pro|vi&s;ions and &s;tores, by the genero&s;ity of her Impe|rial Maje&s;ty of Ru&s;&s;ia, and by the care and bene|volence of her Governors and officers.</P>

<P>On the 29th, about eight, A. M. we came in &s;ight of a whole fleet of &s;mall craft, which we took to be f&s;hing-ve&s;&s;els.

This proved one of the northernmo&s;t of the Ladrone I&s;lands. As &s;oon as we came within di&s;tance, we fired two guns for a pilot, and one came pre&s;ently along-&s;ide, and our Captain agreed for thirty-five dol|lars to carry us into Macao.</P>
<P>December 1&s;t, about two in the afternoon, after a pa&s;&s;age of one-and-twenty days, we ca&s;t anchor within four miles of the harbour, where we were met by two Chine&s;e gentlemen, who told us of the French war, and of his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip the Seahor&s;e having left that place about the time we left Kam&s;hat&s;ka. About eight in the evening our boats were manned, and our third Lieutenant went to the Engli&s;h factory there for news, and about ten returned with the magazines and news-papers for 1776, 1777, 1778, being the late&s;t they had received. He likewi&s;e brought a confirmation of the French war, and of the continuance of the American war; and that five &s;ail of Engli&s;h &s;hips were now at Vampo, near Canton, in China.</P>
<P>On the 2d, early in the morning, we made &s;ail, and anchored a-brea&s;t of the i&s;land, and &s;aluted the Governor with thirteen guns, which were an|&s;wered
<PB N="365" REF="449">
with an equal number from the fort. We had &s;carce dropt anchor, when we were vi&s;ited by two Engli&s;h gentlemen, who, after learning who we were, and what we had been upon, per|&s;uaded the Commodore to leave our then &s;itua|tion, and to moor the &s;hips in a &s;afer birth to the leeward of a &s;mall i&s;land about two miles di&s;tant, where they might remain without danger.</P>
<P>It was now three years &s;ince we had been in any port, where we could conver&s;e any otherwi&s;e than by &s;igns; and before any one was &s;uffered to go a&s;hore, the Commodore called all hands aft, and ordered them to deliver up their jour|nals, and every writing, remark, or memoran|dum that any of them had made of any particu|lar re&s;pecting the voyage, on pain of the &s;e|vere&s;t puni&s;hment in ca&s;e of concealment, in or|der that all tho&s;e journals, writings, remarks, or memorandums, re&s;pecting the voyage, might be &s;ealed up, and directed to the Lords of the Ad|miralty. At the &s;ame time requiring that every chart of the coa&s;ts, or of any part of any of the coa&s;ts where we had been, or draught of any thing curious might be delivered up in like man|ner, in order to accompany the journals, &amp;c. all which was complied with; and the papers were made up and &s;ealed accordingly in &s;ight of the whole crew, the papers of the commi&s;&s;ioned offi|cers by them&s;elves, the papers of the non-com|mi&s;&s;ioned officers by them&s;elves, and the papers of the marines and common men by them&s;elves. The boats were then ordered out, and &s;ent to Macao for fre&s;h provi&s;ions, which next day were dealt out to the &s;hips companies at full allowance. But before the&s;e could return, there came from the town boats with beef, veal, pork, ducks, gee&s;e, turnips, carrots, lemons, oranges, and every other
<PB N="366" REF="450">
article of provi&s;ions which the i&s;land produced; &s;ome as pre&s;ents to the Captains and officers; but by far the greate&s;t part to make their market.</P>
<P>Being now &s;afely moored, the fir&s;t thing that claimed the attention of the Commodore, was to provide as well as he could for the &s;afety of the crews in their return home. The news of a French war, without letting us know at the &s;ame time the order i&s;&s;ued by the French king in our favour, gave us much concern. Our &s;hips were ill fitted for war; the decks fore and aft being fini&s;hed flu&s;h, had no covering for men or officers; it was therefore thought nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen the &s;tanchions and rails, and to rai&s;e a kind of parapet, mu&s;ket-proof on both decks; and likewi&s;e to &s;trengthen the cabins as much as po&s;&s;ible, in ca&s;e of action. And as it was agreed that both &s;hips could carry more guns, if any were to be purcha&s;ed, the Commo|dore was for taking the &s;hips to Canton, till per|&s;uaded from it by &s;ome gentlemen belonging to the Engli&s;h factory, who undertook to negociate the bu&s;ine&s;s without giving umbrage to the Chi|ne&s;e, who certainly would, they &s;aid, be offended at the appearance of &s;hips of war in their river, and would oppo&s;e their progre&s;s; reminding him at the &s;ame time, of the di&s;agreeable di&s;pute in which Commodore An&s;on was formerly involved on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion; and how hurtful it was to the Company's commerce for &s;everal years after. Upon the&s;e repre&s;entations the Commodore re|linqui&s;hed his de&s;ign, and Capt. King, with other officers, were &s;ent in a Company's &s;hip, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by one or two gentlemen belonging to the fac|tory, to Canton, to purcha&s;e cannon and &s;uch other &s;tores as were not to be had at Macao.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="451">On the 18th they &s;et &s;ail, and at the &s;ame time two Portugue&s;e ve&s;&s;els from the harbour of Ma|cao, came and anchored clo&s;e by us. They were bound to Bengal and Madras, and very readily a&s;&s;i&s;ted us with ropes for running rigging, &s;ome canvas, and with 60 fathom of cable. They likewi&s;e exchanged four &s;mall cannon and some &s;hot with the Di&s;covery for a &s;pare anchor.</P>
<P>The 25th, being Chri&s;tmas-day, was kept, as is u&s;ual with Engli&s;h &s;ailors, in jollity and mirth; and what added to the plea&s;ure of the day, there was not a man ill in either &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 28th the Commodore received a let|ter from Capt. King, with an account of the di&s;a&s;ters that had happened in the pa&s;&s;age, hav|ing lo&s;t two anchors and their boat, and were &s;everal times in danger of running a&s;hore; that they did not arrive at Canton till the 24th; but that he hoped &s;oon to return with the cannon and &s;tores, for which he had bargained, though at a great price.</P>
<P>Here they learnt that the &s;kins we had brought with us from the N. W. Continent of America, were of nearly double the value at Canton, as at Kam&s;hat&s;ka.</P>
<P>Early on the 29th there came into the harbour of Macao a Spani&s;h galleon from Manilla, &s;aid to have more than two millions of trea&s;ure on board; and before we left our &s;tation, there came in ano|ther worth double that &s;um. We were unac|quainted with the Spani&s;h war, or the&s;e &s;hips, had we been properly commi&s;&s;ioned, might ea&s;ily have been captured. It is a&s;toni&s;hing, that none of our crui&s;ers have ever lain in wait for the&s;e &s;hips, as their voyage is annual, and their cour&s;e known.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="452">The &s;ame evening a quarrel happened between a party of our &s;ailors, on &s;hore with leave, and &s;ome of the town's people, in which &s;everal were dangerou&s;ly wounded on both &s;ides; and Mr. Bur|ney, fir&s;t Lieutenant of the Re&s;olution, had a dagger run through his left arm in endeavour|ing to put an end to the fray. For this in&s;ult the Governor &s;ent to demand &s;atisfaction; but upon examination, the town's people were found to be the aggre&s;&s;ors. The Governor made a very hand&s;ome apology for his mi&s;take, and the affair ended without any &s;erious con&s;equences.</P>
<P>We were now vi&s;ited daily by &s;trangers, who came out of curio&s;ity to &s;ee &s;hips that had been &s;o many years upon di&s;covery; and every one was anxious to learn what he could concerning our cour&s;e, but that we were not at liberty to tell them. Among the re&s;t came two French &s;pies, as we imagined; but not being able to make out any thing criminal again&s;t them, they were &s;uffered to depart. The &s;u&s;picion aro&s;e from &s;ome of our men, who having particularly marked them, in|&s;i&s;ted that they had formerly &s;ailed with them in the French &s;ervice. Nothing remarkable till</P>
<P>Jan. the 8th, 1780, when Capt. King, with the officers that accompanied him, arrived in the Com|pany's ve&s;&s;el, with the cannon, ammunition, and &s;tores from Canton. The&s;e being &s;hipped, no|thing remained to be done, but to take on board the live &s;tock which the Commodore and officers had purcha&s;ed for their own u&s;e, and nine head of cattle to be killed at &s;ea for the u&s;e of the &s;hip's company; the beef and pork which we brought from England, being now &s;carce eatable. Pro|vi&s;ions of all kinds were here very dear, and very indifferent; but what made us amends, was the
<PB N="369" REF="453">
price they gave for our furs, on which they &s;et a great value.</P>
<P>On the 11th of January we unmoored, and the wind being fair, came to &s;ail with a plea&s;ant breeze; but the wind dying away in the evening, we ca&s;t anchor; and in the night, John Cave, Quarter-ma&s;ter, and Robert Spencer, ran away with the great cutter. And</P>
<P>On the 12th, we were the whole day detained in endeavouring to recover them, but to no pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 13th, we pa&s;&s;ed the fort, and &s;aluted the garri&s;on with 13 four pounders, which they an&s;wered with an equal number.</P>
<P>We had now nothing but a beaten track to pa&s;s, in our way to our long wi&s;hed-for native country.</P>
<P>On the 20th, we made the little group of i&s;lands, known by the name of Pulo Condore, in lat. 8.40. N. at one of which we anchored, and found it inhabited. Here we both wooded and watered, and the carpenters felled &s;ome large trees, which were afterwards &s;awed on board. The trees on the&s;e i&s;lands are chiefly cedar, iron-wood, man|grove, manchinael, and box. Some nutmeg-trees there were, but of a wild kind, that bear a fruit without ta&s;te or &s;mell. In pur&s;uit of game, of which there was plenty, our gentlemen fell in with a party of natives, one of whom accompanied them to the &s;hips. We made him under&s;tand that we wanted provi&s;ions; and he had not left us long, before a number of boats came round the i&s;land, laden with fruits, fowls, ducks, and other provi|&s;ions, which they readily exchanged for any thing we offered them, though they were not wholly un|acquainted with the u&s;e of money; for being in|formed that herds of buffaloes were on the i&s;land, we purcha&s;ed &s;even; three of them, of a large &s;ize,
<PB N="370" REF="454">
from four to &s;even dollars each. The&s;e were fierce animals, and were not ea&s;ily brought on board; but after being &s;ubdued, were as gentle and trac|table as the gentle&s;t of our other cattle. What &s;eems &s;urpri&s;ing is, that the men on the i&s;land dare hardly go near them when loo&s;e in the woods; but they will &s;uffer little boys to handle and halter them, which is done by pa&s;&s;ing a rope through a hole made in their no&s;trils, and round their horns; notwith&s;tanding which, &s;ome of them broke the trees down to which they were fa&s;tened. Here we found the cabbage-tree, and other &s;ucculent greens, with which our people made very free, without a&s;king que&s;tions.</P>
<P>On the 28th we unmoored; and on</P>
<P>The 31&s;t, made the i&s;land of Banka; and hav|ing pa&s;&s;ed the Straits,</P>
<P>On the 5th of February, we made the i&s;land of Sumatra, where we &s;aw a large &s;hip lying at an|chor; and</P>
<P>On the 7th, pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land of Java, where we &s;aw two more. We made the &s;ignal to the Di&s;covery to prepare for action, and we did the &s;ame, hoi&s;ting Engli&s;h colours. It was &s;ome time before they &s;hewed any, but, at length, they hoi&s;ted Dutch colours. We &s;ent our boat on board, and received the fir&s;t news of a Spani&s;h war. We pur&s;ued our cour&s;e; and</P>
<P>On the 11th, we made the i&s;land of Cocoterra. Here, from a healthy &s;hip's company, &s;everal of our people fell ill of the flux, and &s;o continued for &s;ome time; however, having got plenty of good water on board, we &s;ailed</P>
<P>On the 13th, directing our cour&s;e to Prince's i&s;land.</P>
<P>On the 15th, we entered the bay of Prince's i&s;land, where Capt. Cook, when he commanded
<PB N="371" REF="455">
the Endeavour, anchored in his return to Europe. Here we purcha&s;ed turtles, fowls, and &s;ome deer; and here we laid in &s;tore of cocoa-nuts, plantains, and other vegetables; and having compleated our &s;tock of water, &s;et &s;ail</P>
<P>On the 18th, directing our cour&s;e for the Cape of Good Hope. Nothing remarkable till</P>
<P>The 25th of March, when we were attacked by a &s;evere &s;torm, attended with thunder, light|ning and rain, which la&s;ted five days without in|termi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the 7th of April, we were alarmed by find|ing our rudder-head almo&s;t twi&s;ted off. We got the pendants fixed to &s;teer with tackles, it being the carpenter's opinion it could not la&s;t till our ar|rival at the next port. However, by proper ap|plication it la&s;ted till we arrived at the Cape.</P>
<P>On the 9th, we fell in with Cape Lagullas, where, about nine in the morning, we &s;aw a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el crui&s;ing, which proved to be the Ea&s;t India Company's &s;now, Bet&s;ey, looking out for the Ea&s;t India fleet. She left England the 5th of Novem|ber, and Fal&s;e Bay on the 4th in&s;tant. She con|firmed the account we had received of the Spani&s;h war. We exchanged &s;ome trifles, and &s;oon parted. And</P>
<P>On the 12th, we entered Bay Fal&s;e, came to, and moored the &s;ame day, after having &s;aluted the fort with 13 guns, which was an&s;wered by the &s;ame number. We had &s;carce dropt anchor, when the Governor came on board, bringing with him a packet of letters for Capt. Cook, which had lain there ever &s;ince the beginning of 1779; he had heard of the death of Capt. Cook by a Dutch ve&s;&s;el, and expre&s;&s;ed great concern for that unhappy event, a&s;king a thou&s;and que&s;tions concerning the particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="456">The fir&s;t care of our Commodore was to pro|vide for the &s;ick; and by three in the afternoon they were all landed, and &s;ent to the ho&s;pital un|der the care of the Surgeon's mate. All hands were next &s;et to their different employments, &s;ome to wood and water, and &s;ome to compleat the re|pairs. The&s;e they forwarded with the utmo&s;t ex|pedition, every one being eager to get to his native country. Of the repairs, the Re&s;olution's rudder was the mo&s;t material. The fir&s;t thing, therefore, to be done, was to unhinge it and get it on &s;hore; and though this was immediately put in hand, it was</P>
<P>The 27th before it was re&s;tored to its place.</P>
<P>By the 29th, the fick, who were numerous when we arrived at the Cape, we having 16 ill of the flux, were pretty well recovered: the repairs were in forwardne&s;s, and the &s;tores ready to be taken on board at a moment's notice, when news was brought us, that an expre&s;s was arrived at Ta|ble Bay from England, in the Sibbald frigate, which had only been ten weeks from Plymouth, and that &s;he was to return again as &s;oon as &s;he had delivered her di&s;patches. Both Captains went in|&s;tantly to learn the contents; and, on their return, orders were given to prepare as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible to &s;ail. This was joyful news. The &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e di&s;patches related chiefly to the cour&s;e the Ea&s;t Indiamen were to &s;teer, to fall in with the convoy appointed to meet them; with &s;ome in|&s;tructions for our Commodore, re&s;pecting the pa|pers which were to be tran&s;mitted to the Admi|ralty, which were all put on board the frigate; and Mr. Portlock, Ma&s;ter's mate, embarked along with them.</P>
<P>On the 30th, they &s;et &s;ail; but it was</P>
<P>The 7th of May before we were in readine&s;s to follow. About noon, on that day, the &s;ignal was
<PB N="373" REF="457">
made for unmooring. We had now 120 live &s;heep on board, and the Di&s;covery a like propor|tion. We had all other provi&s;ions in equal plenty, and we had likewi&s;e a healthy crew, in high &s;pi|rits, wi&s;hing for nothing but a fair wind to &s;horten our voyage; but that was not yet to be obtained. We had &s;carce &s;aluted the garri&s;on on taking leave, when the wind died away, and a great &s;well en&s;ued, which continued till</P>
<P>The 9th, when the &s;now came in &s;ight, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;poke with on the 8th of April.

<P>On the 19th of April, the whole crew were near being blown up, by the Snow's taking fire forwards: the &s;hip was much damaged, and they were putting into the Cape to re&s;it, and then were bound for St. Helena.</P>
<P>On the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">th, we made &s;ail, and pur&s;ued our cour&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> without any material occurrence, till</P>
<P>The 10th of June, when the Di&s;covery's boat brought us word, that, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">i&s;ing the great guns, the carpenter's mate had his arm &s;hattered in a &s;hocking manner, by part of the wadding be|ing left in after a former di&s;charge; another man was &s;lightly wounded at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>On the 12th, it began to blow very hard, and &s;o continued till next day, when the Di&s;covery &s;prung her main-top-ma&s;t, and we were obliged to lie-to till another was put up.</P>
<P>On the 13th, we cro&s;&s;ed the line to the North|ward, and ob&s;erved a water-&s;pout to the N. W. at no great di&s;tance; and for the remainder of the month had fine weather. Thermometer from 80 to 78&frac12;.</P>
<P>July the 1&s;t, we had the Di&s;covery's people on
<PB N="374" REF="458">
board, to compare time. Lat. at noon, 20. N. long. 34. W.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the &s;hip's birth-day was celebrated on board, and double allowance given to the whole crew, who were at this time in perfect health.</P>
<P>On the 27th, at day-light, the Di&s;covery made the &s;ignal for &s;eeing a &s;ail. We in&s;tantly began to clear &s;hip, in ca&s;e of an enemy, and hoi&s;ted Engli&s;h colours; and, on our near approach, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ail did the &s;ame.

<P>On the 1st of Augu&s;t, ju&s;t at &s;un-&s;et, we &s;aw a &s;ail at a great di&s;tance to the We&s;tward, but in the morning &s;he was quite out of &s;ight. We were then in lat. 43.56. N.</P>
<P>On the 7th, we were in lat. 48. long. 10.10. W. a heavy gale, with rain.</P>
<P>On the 9th, the wind &s;hifted to the Ea&s;tward, when we &s;haped our cour&s;e to the North of Ire+land. Blew hard all day</P>

<P>By the 29th, we had got wood and water enough on board to &s;erve us to London; and at noon, the &s;ignal was made to weigh; but the wind coming about, and blowing fre&s;h from the S. E. obliged us not only to relinqui&s;h our de&s;ign for the pre|&s;ent, but detained us till the 19th of September.</P>
<P>On the 20th of September, Capt. King of the Di&s;covery, Mr. Bailey, our a&s;tronomer, and Mr. Webber, left the &s;hips, and &s;et out for London; and Mr. Burney, fir&s;t Lieutenant of the Re&s;olution, took the command of the Di&s;covery in the ab&s;ence of Capt. King.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay, the &s;hips were vi&s;ited by gen|tlemen from all the i&s;lands round; and by the Apollo frigate and her con&s;ort: they brought in a prize, valued at 10,000l. and both Captains came to vi&s;it Capt. Gore, on board the Re&s;olution, who now was taken very ill, and &s;o continued to the end of the voyage. The &s;ame afternoon, the wind came round in our favour, when the &s;ignal was made for unmooring, and both &s;hips got under way. At night we came to an anchor with the tide.</P>
<P>On the 23d, Samuel John&s;on, Serjeant of ma|rines, died; and next morning his corp&s;e was committed to the deep.</P>
<P>On the 25th, the wind came again to the Ea&s;tward, and continued again&s;t us mo&s;t of our pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>On the 28th, we pa&s;&s;ed by Leith, off which we again &s;poke with his Maje&s;ty's &s;hip Apollo.</P>
<P>On the 29th, John Davis, Quarter-ma&s;ter, died. Our deten&s;ion at Stromne&s;s proved unfortunate for the&s;e two men, who died in their pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;Had the &s;hips arrived in a direct cour&s;e, their

<P>On the 30th, we came to an anchor off Yar|mouth, in company with his Maje&s;ty's &s;loops of war, the Fly and Alderney. Our boats were im|mediately &s;ent on &s;hore for provi&s;ions; and for a &s;pare cable for our &s;mall bower, that we had being near worn out. We lay here till</P>
