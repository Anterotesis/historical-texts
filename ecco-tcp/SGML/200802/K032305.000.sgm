<P>C&V;&s;tom has made &s;ome Things ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and two Sheets without a Dedication, or a Preface, by way of Excu&s;e, would be an unpardonable In|decency: To avoid which, I was con&s;idering at who&s;e Feet to lay the&s;e following Scenes. Fir&s;t I thought of offering it to all tho&s;e young Wives who had &s;old them|&s;elves for Money, and been inter'd with Mi&s;ery from the fir&s;t Day of their Marriage; but &s;uppo&s;ing their chief Plea&s;ure to con&s;i&s;t in Pride, and that they had rather gra|tify their Ambition in the Arms of a Fool, or Four&s;core, than wed a Man of Sen&s;e of narrower Fortunes, I con|cluded 'em unworthy of my Notice.</P>
<P>Then the Race of Old Men pre&s;ented them&s;elves in my Mind, who, de&s;pi&s;ing Women of their own Years, marry Girls of fifteen, by which they keep open Hou&s;e for all the young Fellows in Town, in order to encre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e their Families, and make their Tables flouri&s;h like the Vine: But my Aver&s;ion to Fools of all Kinds, made me decline them too.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, ca&s;ting my Eyes upon the Title of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">rce, I found it could ju&s;tly belong to none but the Magnificent Company of <HI>Upholders,</HI> whom the judicious Cen&s;or of <HI>Great Britain</HI> has &s;o often conde&s;cended to mention; to you then, worthy Sirs, who&s;e &s;olemn Train keeps up the pompous State of Beauty, beyond the Limits of a Ga&s;p of Breath, and draws the gazing World to admire, even after Death; to you this Piece I Dedicate; 'tis but Rea&s;on that you &s;hould receive &s;ome Tribute from us Living, who &s;o truly mourn us dead.
