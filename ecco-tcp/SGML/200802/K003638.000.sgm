<HEAD>AN EVENING's WALK.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>_ONE &s;ummer's eve, when ev'ry &s;wain was hous'd,</L>
<L>When Sol had &s;carce one glimmer left behind,</L>
<L>Each little &s;tar, faint glitt'ring, ca&s;t a ray,</L>
<L>And &s;pangled o'er the du&s;ky robe of night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fond of the &s;cene, I wander'd far from home,</L>
<L>O'er leafle&s;s lawns, and flower-breeding vales,</L>
<L>Till weary nature &s;lacken'd in my &s;teps,</L>
<L>And made me halt upon a friendly bank.</L>
<L>Calm thro' a bridge there ran a peerle&s;s &s;tream,</L>
<L>That &s;carcely mov'd the ozier's &s;lender wand:</L>
<L>Here I took my &s;tand, and view'd the &s;olemn &s;cene.</L>
<L>The bat had been an hour on the wing,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="12">
Cha&s;ing the night-fly and the buzzing gnat:</L>
<L>The purblind owl had left the ancient tower,</L>
<L>Prowling with flo&s;&s;y wing along the mead.</L>
<L>Anon, as out of Chaos, &s;hot a ray</L>
<L>Of chearing light, quiv'ring o'er the hills&punc;</L>
<L>As yet too weak to &s;truggle with the dark;</L>
<L>Or, as th' Egyptian queen, far off beheld,</L>
<L>Shot her fir&s;t beams on the Italian &s;hore,</L>
<L>Her brilliant train reflecting on the waves,</L>
<L>Making the Tybur like a golden &s;ea.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Clouds that o'er-hung the horizon, un&s;een,</L>
<L>Appear'd in view, like &s;ilver-&s;kirted troops</L>
<L>Waiting the up-ri&s;e of the queen of night.</L>
<L>Slow &s;he approach'd, and &s;mil'd upon the world,</L>
<L>Op'ning fre&s;h land&s;capes to my wond'ring eyes.</L>
<L>Philomel now chear'd the embow'ring grove,</L>
<L>The woodlark too, mi&s;taking it for day,</L>
<L>Join'd her &s;weet notes with emulating &s;trains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Near to my left there &s;tood an ancient pile,</L>
<L>By wa&s;ting time, and &s;avage war defac'd,</L>
<L>Like a reduc'd and hoary-headed chief,</L>
<L>Commanding awe even in de&s;truction.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="13">
On its &s;linty &s;ides deep-dy'd ivy clung;</L>
<L>Its roof was capt with velvet-grounded mo&s;s,</L>
<L>And round its ba&s;e, wild weeds and flowers grew,</L>
<L>The &s;tinging nettle with the briars blend,</L>
<L>The &s;ecret haunt of adders and of toads.</L>
<L>Thro' the wide breaches of the rock-built walls</L>
<L>Pale Cynthia beam'd her lucid columns down</L>
<L>Upon the verdant &s;lope, in lines direct and clear,</L>
<L>Reflecting on a dimpled brook below.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A &s;olemn &s;ilence now o'er&s;pread the globe,</L>
<L>Save when the minnew wanton'd on the &s;tream,</L>
<L>And left a circle &s;preading to the brink.</L>
<L>Anon, as wind from out &s;ome hollow cave,</L>
<L>A deep-felt &s;igh from out the ruins came,</L>
<L>As from a heart ju&s;t bur&s;ting with its load,</L>
<L>Which &s;treight was an&s;wer'd with a voice of woe,</L>
<L>Like &s;orrow &s;oothing the more &s;ad de&s;pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A while I &s;tood, in doubt, to know the cau&s;e,</L>
<L>Or to retreat, le&s;t &s;ome deluding fiend,</L>
<L>Aping the voice of grief, meant to de&s;troy.</L>
<L>At length re&s;olv'd, with caution I approach'd,</L>
<L>O melting &s;ight! my wounded heart ran o'er</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="14">
And empty'd at my eyes.&mdash;A mournful pair,</L>
<L>The woeful part ners of affliction &s;at,</L>
<L>On the low ba&s;is of a mould'ring urn</L>
<L>And open'd to my view a tragic &s;cene.</L>
<L>Conceal'd, I &s;tood, ob&s;erving their di&s;tre&s;s;</L>
<L>She, in her lap, an infant cherub held,</L>
<L>A lovely boy, the offspring of their loves.</L>
<L>Her eyes were bent with &s;orrow on the babe,</L>
<L>While in her face the little dear one &s;mil'd,</L>
<L>And then, with tears of mi&s;ery and love,</L>
<L>She clung him eager to her throbbing brea&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The wretched hu&s;band on her neck reclin'd,</L>
<L>Striving to chear his melancholy dame,</L>
<L>Feigned a hope, tho' foreign to his heart:</L>
<L>But when he found de&s;pair had &s;eiz'd her &s;oul,</L>
<L>His tears bur&s;t forth, and bath d his manly cheeks,</L>
<L>And on his bended knees he trembling fell,</L>
<L>Lifting his eyes with angui&s;h 'gain&s;t the &s;ky,</L>
<L>With invocations loud, and agonizing &s;ighs,</L>
<L>Imploring heaven for a ray of peace,</L>
<L>Till his loud accents &s;hook the vaulted roof,</L>
<L>And reft his tortur'd brea&s;t.&mdash;I cou'd no more,</L>
<L>But flying to his aid with heart di&s;tre&s;s'd,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="15">
He fix'd his eyes with furious glare upon me,</L>
<L>And threaten'd me with death if I advanc'd;</L>
<L>Like the fierce tyger, a&s;&s;ail'd by hunters</L>
<L>In his dreary den, he &s;tood defen&s;ive o'er his young,</L>
<L>Shielding 'em from danger. With humble voice</L>
<L>And friendly tears I mov'd him to attend,</L>
<L>And li&s;ten patient to the voice of pity.</L>
<L>Joy then, with fear and admiration mix'd,</L>
<L>O'er&s;pread each face, and as I &s;pake, they ble&s;t;</L>
<L>Hope, like the &s;un that clouds had long o'erveil'd,</L>
<L>Flu&s;h'd on their cheeks, extingui&s;hing de&s;pair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye woeful pair let your &s;u&s;picions cea&s;e;</L>
<L>If the ba&s;e world has put ye out of door,</L>
<L>If friends for&s;ake and creditors pur&s;ue:</L>
<L>If you once more can tru&s;t a thought to hope,</L>
<L>And think it po&s;&s;ible to meet a friend,</L>
<L>Tell me your &s;tory, and you yet &s;hall find</L>
<L>That fate relents, and cea&s;es to afflict.</L>
<L>Tho' here to you a &s;tranger I appear,</L>
<L>To mercy I am none; to &s;ee another wretched</L>
<L>Makes me wretched too: by &s;erving others</L>
<L>I &s;till my&s;elf oblige, and meet reward,</L>
<L>Ample reward, a tranquil happine&s;s!</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="16">
Seeing others &s;o, by me made happy.</L>
<L>I'd rather wipe the tear of grief away</L>
<L>Than add a ruby to a monarch's crown,</L>
<L>And win a Prince's promi&s;e for my pains.</L>
<L>If fate's not giv'n you over to de&s;pair,</L>
<L>And you'll accept of friend&s;hip once again,</L>
<L>Chear your &s;ad hearts&mdash;let ev'ry fear &s;ub&s;ide,</L>

<L>Let me embrace thee;&mdash;O! pardon me, too,</L>
<L>That I a&s;&s;ail'd thee with the threat of death,</L>
<L>When thou but meant to &s;ave me from his &s;haft;</L>
<L>For O! thy words were welcome to my &s;oul</L>
<L>As mollient dews that fall upon the mead,</L>

<L>That ever eye beheld, or tempted death to kill,</L>
<L>(This drooping fair one, and her &s;miling boy,)</L>
<L>For they have &s;uffer'd more than I dare tell,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="17">
And to repeat, is more than I can bear:</L>
<L>She once, alas, was fortune's favourite</L>
<L>And Minerva's pride, the tender fondling</L>
<L>Of a wealthy pair&mdash;O! &s;ad remembrance;</L>
<L>Provoking tears! when will ye cea&s;e to flow!</L>
<L>The&s;e eyes have long been &s;trangers to a &s;mile;</L>
<L>Excu&s;e me, friend, if they di&s;gu&s;t thee.</L>
<L>We &s;ing of others woe, but cry our own;</L>
<L>My heart has gu&s;hed at a thou&s;and veins,</L>
<L>To &s;ee the &s;ufferings of a matchle&s;s wife&mdash;</L>
<L>There was a time, when this for&s;aken held</L>
<L>At &s;uch an hour would have giv'n delight,</L>
<L>When &s;olitude and night would give a &s;cope</L>
<L>To thought, and yield a plea&s;ing melancholy</L>
<L>To the jaded mind, o'ercharg'd with plea&s;ure</L>
<L>And variety; but now, how dreary and &s;orlorn</L>
<L>It &s;eems; and as we tell our mournful tale,</L>
<L>With double horror echoes back each word,</L>
<L>Mocking adver&s;ity, in hollow &s;ounds,&mdash;</L>
<L>Telling us over what is death to hear.&mdash;</L>
<L>Such tale as mine, good friend, I oft have read,</L>
<L>Such woeful &s;cenes have oft been play'd;</L>
<L>With &s;ympathizing heart I've heard and &s;een,</L>
<L>And dropp'd a tear for the oppre&s;s'd and brave;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="18">
But ere I'd &s;lept the fiction fled my brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And time would leave no traces on the mind.</L>
<L>When we become the objects of di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>Remembrance &s;tamps it with an iron &s;eal</L>
<L>Upon our hearts, and ev'ry thought is death.</L>
<L>But to my &s;tory, 'tis my friend's de&s;ire&mdash;</L>
<L>I am no &s;tranger to this gloomy pile,</L>
<L>I oft have paid a vi&s;it to the&s;e walls,</L>
<L>And oft admir'd the romantic form,</L>
<L>When the fair morn invited me abroad,</L>
<L>When fertile nature da&s;y'd ev'ry hill,</L>
<L>And ev'ry meadow blu&s;h'd a purple hue:</L>
<L>When thru&s;hes &s;ang, and linnet, charm'd the grove;</L>
<L>My heart then drank in plea&s;ure at my eyes,</L>
<L>And felt no interrupter by the way,</L>
<L>No wretched thought to da&s;h it back again.&mdash;</L>
<L>My father was a man of wealth and note,</L>
<L>(And held a man&s;ion in a village by)</L>
<L>A better ne'er gave being to a &s;on:&mdash;</L>
<L>I having read of mighty things abroad,</L>

<L>The wealth of India and Egyptian wilds.</L>
<L>With thir&s;t for novelty and de&s;ire,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="19">
I urg'd my father, and at length prevail'd,</L>
<L>That he would let me venture on a tour,</L>

<L>'Tis &s;ix years &s;ince I left my native home;</L>
<L>Since when, &s;o many wonders I have &s;een,</L>

<LG>
<L>Returning home, I cro&s;s'd the mighty Alps;</L>
<L>A deadly &s;ickne&s;s &s;eiz'd me on the way,</L>
<L>And made me &s;eek for &s;uccour and a <HI>friend;</HI></L>
<L>A greater rarity than all I'd met.</L>
<L>An ample dwelling open'd to my view,</L>
<L>To which I bent my way, and &s;helter a&s;k'd,</L>
<L>And was receiv'd at once a welcome gue&s;t.</L>
<L>With mild compa&s;&s;ion they beheld my &s;tate,</L>

<L>And ev'ry day a true attendance paid:</L>
<L>When I was &s;trugling with the pangs of death,</L>

And with con&s;oling hope &s;he'd drop a tear,</L>
<L>Imploring heaven to pre&s;erve my life.</L>
