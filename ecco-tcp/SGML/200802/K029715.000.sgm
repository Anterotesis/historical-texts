<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>After a &s;hort introduction, which &s;tates the miraculous acts of Chri&s;t, and &s;erves to mark the period at which the Poem commences, Satan goes forth by night into the wilderne&s;s, and finds him&s;elf in the very &s;pot, where he had in vain practi&s;ed his temptations upon Chri&s;t: Here he falls into meditation upon that un&s;ucce&s;sful interview, and vents him&s;elf in &s;oliloquy: Indignant under di&s;appointment and impatient to repair his defeat, he a&s;cends to the &s;ummit of the mountain, from whence he had exhibited the kingdoms of the earth, and calls the Devils from all parts of the Heathen world: The whole ho&s;t of Infernals a&s;|&s;emble at his &s;ummons: The chief leaders are enumerated, their per&s;ons and attributes de&s;cribed: Satan addre&s;&s;es them, and propo&s;es the &s;ubject matter for their con&s;ultation, namely, By what means to counteract the power of Chri&s;t upon earth: Baal delivers his &s;entiments by &s;tating difficulties and objections without any decided opinion unle&s;s for &s;educ|tion in the general: Moloch angrily re&s;ents what he con&s;iders as pointed at him&s;elf, and &s;peaks di&s;dainfully again&s;t the propo&s;al of &s;educ|tion, as not only de&s;perate but di&s;graceful: Belial replies, and after much circumlocution &s;ugge&s;ts a temptation to be &s;et on foot by Mam|mon: He is interrupted by Satan, who reproves him for certain di|gre&s;&s;ions in his &s;peech, but adopts his hint of employing Mammon, and calls upon that evil Spirit to attempt the fidelity of Judas I&s;cariot, whom he points out to him as the only one of the Di&s;ciples open to &s;e|duction: Mammon at fir&s;t affects to excu&s;e him&s;elf from the undertak|ing, but in conclu&s;ion accepts it, and taking wing in pre&s;ence of the whole applauding ho&s;t &s;ets out upon his emba&s;&s;y, directing his cour&s;e to the city of Jeru&s;alem.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>Mammon, alighting on the Holy Mount, a&s;&s;umes the form and character of a Levite, and under that appearance goes in &s;earch of Judas I&s;cariot. He meets that di&s;ciple mo&s;t opportunely for his purpo&s;e in a &s;olitary place, and entering into conver&s;ation with him, pretends a commi&s;&s;ion from the prie&s;ts and elders for engaging him in their &s;ervice with the promi&s;e of a reward, and urges many in&s;idious arguments for detaching him from his Ma&s;ter: They &s;eparate with a promi&s;e on the part of Judas to report his final an&s;wer to the prie&s;ts that evening. Chri&s;t is now brought to view &s;itting in the mid&s;t of his di&s;ciples at his La&s;t Supper: He addre&s;&s;es them in tho&s;e &s;olemn and affecting terms recorded in the Go&s;pel of Saint John, wa&s;hes their feet, foretells his death, and points out to them his betrayer in the per&s;on of Judas then pre&s;ent: The traitor, perceiving him&s;elf di&s;covered, ha&s;tily departs. Chri&s;t, pity|ing the affliction of his di&s;ciples, tenderly con&s;oles them with the promi&s;e of his &s;upport under their future tribulations, and concludes with an aweful invocation to the Father in their behalf: whereupon, warning them that his hour is come, he goes forth to the garden. A reflection, naturally &s;pringing from the &s;ubject, addre&s;&s;ed to unbelievers, clo&s;es the book.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE THIRD BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>I&s;cariot, having &s;eparated him&s;elf from Chri&s;t, wanders through the &s;treets of the city in a di&s;con&s;olate manner, and at length arrives at the brook Cedron without the gates. Here he breaks forth into &s;oliloquy, in which, after reviewing his pa&s;t &s;ituation, he affects to ju&s;tify his pre|&s;ent motives for betraying his Ma&s;ter to the prie&s;ts. Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples, proceeding to the Mount of Olives, are di&s;covered by him as they are pa&s;&s;ing the brook in their way thither, and Judas re&s;olves upon availing him&s;elf of the opportunity for delivering Chri&s;t into the hands of his enemies. In the mean time the prie&s;ts and elders a&s;&s;emble in the palace of Caiaphas, and there hold a council upon the mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued for the apprehen&s;ion of Chri&s;t: The high prie&s;t harangues the a&s;&s;embly to this immediate purport: In the interim Judas is announced, and being admitted makes his propo&s;al to the council; this produces &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the part of Caiaphas, and is objected to by Nicodemus, who after delivering his opinion quits the a&s;&s;embly. Caiaphas then takes up the matter afre&s;h, controverts the &s;entiments of Nicodemus, and with the approbation of all pre&s;ent clo&s;es with the propo&s;als of Judas, and &s;ends out a company with that traiterous di&s;ciple to the Mount of Olives, there to apprehend the per&s;on of Chri&s;t. The a&s;&s;embly breaks up, and the hall is no &s;ooner evacuated by the prie&s;ts and elders, than their &s;eats are filled by Satan and his infernal &s;pirits. Satan addre&s;&s;es to them a congratulatory &s;peech on the &s;ucce&s;s of Mammon's tempta|tion, on whom he be&s;tows many high encomiums; an ovation takes place in honor of that daemon, when Chemos appears wounded by the &s;pear of Gabriel, whom he had encountered on the Mount of Olives, where he had been po&s;ted as a &s;py upon the motions of Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples. Satan, enraged at the account, &s;allies forth with a re&s;olution to revenge the attack by puni&s;hing the temerity of Gabriel, arms him&s;elf for the occa&s;ion, and after much proud vaunting of his &s;uperior prowe&s;s di&s;ap|pears, and the infernal &s;pirits di&s;per&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIFTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>This Book, propo&s;ing to treat of the trial and condemnation of Chri&s;t, opens with an invocation to the Evangeli&s;ts, the &s;acred hi&s;torians of that event.&mdash;Chri&s;t, brought before the prie&s;ts and elders in council, ac|cu&s;ed by the witne&s;&s;es, interrogated by Caiaphas, per&s;i&s;ts in keeping &s;ilence, till being &s;olemnly called upon to declare him&s;elf, he an&s;wers by an affirmation of the truth. In&s;tantly all voices are let loo&s;e upon him, accu&s;ing him of bla&s;phemy and pronouncing him worthy of death: He is delivered over to mockery and in&s;ult. The Jews re&s;olve to arraign him before Pilate on the following morning. He turns and looks upon Peter, who according to prediction had three &s;everal times denied him. The &s;orrow and contrition of that Di&s;ciple is de&s;cribed; he retires apart to bewail his crime and &s;upplicate forgivene&s;s. His prayer and con|fe&s;&s;ion in the temple-porch. The council of the Jews re&s;ort to Pilate next morning and appeal again&s;t Chri&s;t. He informs them that by the Roman law no judgment can be given till the accu&s;ed is confronted with his accu&s;ers, and heard in his defence. Now commences the trial of Chri&s;t before Pilate, who, finding nothing worthy of death in that ju&s;t per&s;on, refers him to Herod as belonging to his juri&s;diction. Herod, after mocking him, arrays him in a gorgeous robe, and in that apparel &s;ends him back to Pilate. He again appears in the judgment hall be|fore Pilate, who after many fruitle&s;s efforts to &s;ave him, the Jews &s;till urging him by their clamorous importunity to crucify him, finding no other way to prevent a tumult of the people, after declaring him&s;elf in|nocent of the blood of Je&s;us by the ceremony of wa&s;hing his hands before the multitude, delivers him to be crucified.</P>

<P>Judas I&s;cariot &s;eized with remor&s;e returns the thirty pieces of &s;ilver to the prie&s;ts and departs: Mammon rea&s;&s;umes the habit of a Levite, and meeting Judas after he had returned the money to the prie&s;ts, in&s;tigates him to de&s;troy him&s;elf. That evil &s;pirit now takes wing and repairs to the wilderne&s;s, convenes the daemons from all parts of Pale&s;tine, and informing them of Satan's expul&s;ion from earth, warns them by his command to betake them&s;elves to flight before the hour of Chri&s;t's cru|cifixion: This is no &s;ooner announced than the whole infernal ho&s;t breaks up in di&s;order and di&s;per&s;es to various parts of the world therein de|&s;cribed.&mdash;The &s;ubject of the Crucifixion is now brought forward: The proce&s;&s;ion &s;ets out for Mount Calvary; Chri&s;t bearing his cro&s;s is be|wailed by the &s;pectators as he pa&s;&s;es: He is &s;een by Gabriel and the angels with him from the mount, on which they were &s;tationed: He addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the daughters of Jeru&s;alem: The executioners nail his hands and feet to the cro&s;s; the prie&s;ts revile him and call upon him to come down; one of the malefactors crucified with him ca&s;ts the &s;ame in his teeth; he is reproved by the other, who&s;e penitence is rewarded by the promi&s;e of immediate &s;alvation and glory: Chri&s;t from the cro&s;s recommends his mother to John the beloved di&s;ciple: Chri&s;t dies: The &s;un is darkened, the earth quakes, the rocks are rent, and the bodies of the &s;aints and prophets are rai&s;ed from the dead and appear upon earth: The prie&s;ts and elders, alarmed by the&s;e prodigies, re&s;ort to Pilate and demand a guard of Romans to defend the &s;epulchre, le&s;t the di&s;ciples &s;hould take away the body of Chri&s;t and pretend that he was ri&s;en: Pilate replies, that they have a watch; bids them &s;ee to it them&s;elves and di&s;mi&s;&s;es them.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SEVENTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>This Book opens with the &s;cene of Mount Calvary at the coming on of evening; Chri&s;t &s;till hanging dead upon the cro&s;s, the di&s;ciples &s;tanding apart and the holy women watching, among&s;t whom is the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin &s;upported by St. John, Chri&s;t having bequeathed her to his care: His addre&s;s to her on this &s;ubject, and her reply. The &s;oldiers come and break the legs of the two malefactors, but finding Chri&s;t already dead, they pierce his heart with a &s;pear and blood and water i&s;&s;ues from the wound: They take him down from the cro&s;s and lay him in the &s;epulchre. His &s;pirit in the meanwhile is conveyed by the angels into the region of Death; that region de&s;cribed, and the di&s;tant pro|&s;pect of the bottomle&s;s pit, where the &s;ouls of the wicked are in torment: Chri&s;t points out the&s;e &s;cenes to Gabriel and in&s;tructs him as to the future objects of his de&s;cent into this gloomy region. Satan expelled from earth falls pro&s;trate at the foot of the throne of Death: He makes &s;uit to that power for protection: Death rejects his interce&s;&s;ions: The per|&s;on and palace of the King of Terrors de&s;cribed: The triumphant entry of Chri&s;t: Satan is hurled into the bottomle&s;s pit and there bound by the &s;trong angel; the horrors of that dreadful abode are repre&s;ented: Death humbles him&s;elf before the Redeemer of mankind, and con&s;cious that his power is overthrown, tenders his crown to Chri&s;t as to his conqueror: He lays the key at his feet, which &s;ets free the &s;ouls of the Saints, who are de&s;tined to be partakers of the fir&s;t re&s;urrection: This key is given to Gabriel with in&s;tructions for their relea&s;e: Chri&s;t in his reply to Death forewarns him of his doom, but &s;ignifies to him that the di&s;&s;olution of his power will not be immediate. The approach of the Saints concludes the Book.</P>

<HEAD>THE ARGUMENT OF THE EIGHTH BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>Chri&s;t, having clo&s;ed his interview with Death, prepares to receive the Saints of the Fir&s;t Re&s;urrection now approaching under the conduct of the angel Gabriel, and having a&s;cended a mount in the mid&s;t of the congregation appears to them in glory: They pay homage to their Re|deemer in a hymn of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving: He addre&s;&s;es them in reply, and a&s;&s;ures them of the ble&s;&s;ings of immortal life be&s;towed upon them by the Father as the reward of righteou&s;ne&s;s: The patriarch Abraham enters into conference with Chri&s;t, in the conclu&s;ion of which the Savior of the world &s;hews him the glorious vi&s;ion of the heavenly Jeru&s;alem, the holy city, as de&s;cribed in the Apocalyp&s;e: When this beatific vi&s;ion is pa&s;&s;ed away, Chri&s;t rea&s;cends to earth in view of the whole a&s;&s;embly of Saints: The angel Gabriel, who is left behind, ad|dre&s;&s;es them from the mount and expounds the purpo&s;es of the Savior's re&s;urrection from the dead and return to earth: Mo&s;es recapitulates the events of his life, in&s;tances the frequent rebellions of the Lord's un|faithful people, and laments their future impenitence and incredulity: Gabriel replies, and from the nature of man's free will explains the origin and nece&s;&s;ity of evil, from which he deduces the benefits of Chri&s;t's death and redemption: And now the Spirit of God de&s;cending on the hearts of the righteous, in&s;pires them with all under&s;tanding and know|ledge, fitted to their happy condition: A Paradi&s;e ari&s;es within the regions of Death; Gabriel addre&s;&s;es them for the la&s;t time, and upon his departure the Poem concludes.</P>
