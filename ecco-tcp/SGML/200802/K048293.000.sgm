<P>THE RIVAL CANDIDATES: A COMIC OPERA In Two ACTS; AS IT IS NOW PERFORMING AT THE THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>By the Rev. HENRY BATE.</P>
<P>LONDON: Printed: Sold by T. BECKET, corner of the Adelphi-buildings, in the Strand; and by W. GRIFFIN, No. 6, Catharine-&s;treet, M,DCC,LXXV.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE RIVAL CANDIDATES is an attempt of the dramatic kind, undertaken by the writer from no motive of literary vanity, but in order to introduce to the world, a young mu&s;ical compo&s;er, who&s;e ta&s;te he conceived might do honour to his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The reformer of the Engli&s;h drama no &s;ooner was informed of him, than he kindly con&s;ented to an early trial of his abilities, and di&s;covered a ge|nerous anxiety for his &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The author arrogates to him&s;elf but a moderate &s;hare of that univer&s;al applau&s;e with which his piece has been received, particularly when he re|collects how much of it is derived from the kind attention of Mr. GARRICK, in the double capaci|ty, of friend, and manager;&mdash;and what immen&s;e claims tho&s;e re&s;pectable per&s;ons have, who fill his little canva&s;s with &s;uch credit to them&s;elves, and their profe&s;&s;ion. To &s;ingle out any one of the&s;e celebrated performers, when all &s;o kindly com|bined to produce, what is deemed a &s;triking repre|&s;entation in the comic &s;tyle, would be a ta&s;k un|plea&s;ing as ungenerous. And therefore, as they have been equally zealous in their endeavours, as happy in the execution of their &s;everal characters, he wi&s;hes them, jointly to accept, the returns of a grateful heart.</P>

<P>PERHAPS you were not aware, when you were kind enough to &s;hew an early counte|nance to the following <HI>petite</HI> OPERA, that &s;o in|dulgent an overture, entitled it in &s;ome mea&s;ure to your future patronage; indeed, notwith&s;tand|ing this circum&s;tance, you might probably have e&s;caped the pre&s;ent mortifying &s;ituation, had not the author conceived, that his piece owes no in|con&s;iderable &s;hare of its dramatic effect to your ta&s;te and judgment:&mdash;hence aro&s;e an appeal to his feelings, too powerful to be treated with &s;ilent indifference.&mdash;</P>
<P>I mean not, however, to alarm your delicacy, by a recital of tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, which have long rendered you an ornament of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable circles;&mdash;nor by recounting tho&s;e private virtues, which &s;tamp you one of the fir&s;t patterns of dome&s;tic felicity; facts however agree|able or in&s;tructive they might prove to &s;ociety, I decline enumerating, in compliment to female diffidence.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
Having therefore made the acknowledgement I conceive due upon this occa&s;ion, it is high time for me frankly to confe&s;s, that vanity had &s;ome influence over me, when I pre&s;umed to think of Mrs. GARRICK for the patrone&s;s of this my FIRST ESSAY.</P>

<L>OH! Lud! What authors have we now adays!</L>
<L><HI>A farmer this!</HI>&mdash;Ecod or what you plea&s;e:</L>
<L>He &s;wears (tho' we've but ju&s;t got thro' one &s;weat-o)</L>
<L>He'll make us &s;peak an epilogue duetto.&mdash;</L>
<L>What &s;ay you <HI>Dragon?</HI>&mdash;Why's your tail &s;o low?&mdash;</L>
<L>Be not chop-fall'n&mdash;they can't damn <HI>you,</HI> you know:&mdash;</L>
<L>What dumb my comrade?&mdash;terrible di&s;a&s;ter;</L>
<L>So I mu&s;t puff for you, and for your ma&s;ter.</L>
<L>Ye Gods be kind!&mdash;No cat-call interference!</L>
<L>Believe, <HI>Tom We&s;ton,</HI> 'tis his fir&s;t appearance.&mdash;</L>

<L>You would not think it; but the rogue's &s;o &s;teady,</L>
<L>He's in the privy-council here, already;</L>
<L>The <HI>Prompter</HI> gives him merit univer&s;al,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e&mdash; <STAGE>[whi&s;tling]</STAGE> his whi&s;tle calls him to rehear&s;al;</L>
<L>Be&s;ides, he imitates no tragic brother,&mdash;</L>
<L>Who makes him pull down one bill&mdash;po&s;t another;</L>
<L>Tho' he's not &s;leek;&mdash;and has an hungry eye,</L>
<L>(A poet's dog is never fed too high)</L>
<L>Yet he is &s;ound, Sirs, and in good condition;</L>
<L>He has no whim&s;ies&mdash;no indi&s;po&s;ition:</L>
<L>When e'er in letters large the bills he graces,</L>
<L>You're &s;ure of &s;eeing him&mdash;if you have places;</L>
<L>He'll <HI>top</HI> the bills, if to this text he &s;ticks;</L>
<L>A dog of parts&mdash;and have no puppy tricks?&mdash;</L>
<L><PB REF="45">
Odzooks, I've lo&s;t his bu&s;ine&s;s in his prai&s;e;</L>
<L>Oh!&mdash;here he's &s;ent to guard his ma&s;ter's bays.</L>
<L>A <HI>Dragon,</HI> once they &s;ay, kept watch and ward,</L>
<L>Some curious golden fruit from thieves to guard.</L>
<L>So to protect the poet's fruit from riot,</L>
<L>Secure &s;ome guineas, and a better diet,</L>
<L>He's &s;ent this <HI>Dragon</HI> critics!&mdash;So be quiet:</L>
<L>Sharp then's the word, my &s;lender wai&s;ted cou&s;ins,</L>
<L>He'll &s;wallow macaronies by the dozens!</L>
<L>Growling, and &s;narling,&mdash;don't let this dog catch ye,</L>
<L>At all your tearing-work he'll over match ye;</L>
<L>If by ill humours, you our bard wou'd puzzle,</L>
<L>I've nothing el&s;e to do&mdash;but &s;lip the muzzle!</L>
<L>Tho' your &s;o high <STAGE>(to the galleries)</STAGE> <HI>You too</HI> he &s;oon wou'd tame;</L>
<L>DRAGON has wings, if I but &s;hew him game.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But &s;hou'd his ma&s;ter's &s;ing-&s;ong melt your &s;oul,</L>
<L>He'll be as &s;oft as&mdash;<HI>Signor Ro&s;ignol:</HI></L>
<L>Will with harmonious howlings &s;well each note,</L>
<L>And bark &s;weet mu&s;ic&mdash;"<HI>only from his throat.</HI>"</L>
