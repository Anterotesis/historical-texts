mo&s;t highly probable, or rather phy&s;ically demon|&s;trable, that a Comet did pa&s;s by at that time, and was, under the Conduct of the Divine Providence, and as his In&s;trument in puni&s;hing a wicked World, the Cau&s;e of that Deluge. The only thing wanting, was, to demon&s;trate from the Period of &s;ome Co|met, and its Situation in the Heavens, A&s;tronomi|cally &s;tated and computed, that &s;uch a Comet did actually come by at that very time: which if it could be once &s;hewn, the whole mu&s;t be own'd as certain, and demon&s;trated, and all the natural Co|rollaries therefrom mu&s;t be allow'd as true, even by the Ob&s;tinate and Incredulous. This indeed at fir&s;t was look'd upon by me as not at all to be expected; &s;ince we then barely began to know, or rather &s;trong|ly to conjecture that Comets did revolve about the Sun in &s;ettled Periods, but without being able to de|termine any one of tho&s;e Periods. But of late God has &s;o ble&s;s'd the Labours of the Learned; and this Part of A&s;tronomy is &s;o much improv'd, e&s;pecially by the farther Pains and Ob&s;ervations of the great Inventor him&s;elf, Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton;</HI> who&s;e Name will never be forgotten while Mathematicks and A&s;tro|nomy are pre&s;erved among Mankind; and by the laborious Calculations of the acute Dr. <HI>Halley,</HI> on the Principles laid down by the former, that what was a few Years ago almo&s;t de&s;pair'd of, is now in great Mea&s;ure di&s;cover'd, and we know, not only that one Comet has come round three or four times already in later Ages, <HI>viz.</HI> A.D. 1456, 1531, 1607, and 1682, and will no doubt come round again <HI>A.D.</HI> 1758, as making its Period in about 75 Years; that another has probably come round in the &s;ame later Ages twice already, <HI>viz. A.D.</HI> 1532, and 1661; and &s;o is to return <HI>A D.</HI> 1789, or 1790, as making its Period in about 129 Years: But, which is the greate&s;t Di&s;covery of all, that the la&s;t mo&s;t remarkable Co|met,
<PB N="3" REF="3">
who&s;e De&s;cent into our Regions has occa&s;ion'd almo&s;t all the modern &s;olid Knowledge we have re|lating to the whole Cometick Sy&s;tem it &s;elf, has al|&s;o &s;everal times been &s;een already within the time of certain Records; I mean in the 44^t^h Year before Chri&s;t, and again <HI>A.D.</HI> 531, or 532; and yet a|gain <HI>A.D.</HI> 1106, be&s;ides this its la&s;t Appearance <HI>A.D.</HI> 1680, whereby we know that it revolves in about 575 Years. This la&s;t Comet I may well call the <HI>mo&s;t remarkable one</HI> that ever appear'd; &s;ince be&s;ides the former Con&s;ideration, I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, that it is no other than that very Comet which came by the Earth at the Beginning of <HI>Noah</HI>'s Deluge, and which was the Cau&s;e of the &s;ame. Now con&s;idering the Premi&s;es, I &s;hall on|ly have occa&s;ion, in order to my pre&s;ent De&s;ign, to prove the&s;e five Things concerning it. (1.) That no other of the known Comets could pa&s;s by the Earth at the Beginning of the Deluge. (2.) That this Comet was of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s with that which pa&s;s'd by at that time. (3.) That its Orbit was then in a due Po&s;ition to pa&s;s by at that Time. (4.) That its de&s;cending Node was then al&s;o in a due Po&s;iti|on for the &s;ame Pa&s;&s;age by. (5.) That its Period exactly agrees to the &s;ame time. Or, in &s;hort, that all the known Circum&s;tances of this Comet do corre&s;pond, and that it actually pa&s;s'd by on or about that very Year, and on or about that very Day of the Year when the Deluge began. All which Things I &s;hall demon&s;trate in their Order.</P>
<P N="1">I. None of the other Comets yet known, I mean of the 21 in Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Table and my <HI>Solar Sy&s;tem,</HI> could be that which pa&s;s'd by the Earth at the Beginning of the Deluge. This appears by the&s;e certain Arguments following.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) None of them appear to have been of a due Bigne&s;s: For the Phaenomena of the Deluge, as I
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New Theor.</HI> 2d Edit. <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">.</HI> 2. <HI>Lem.</HI> 8<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">. &amp; <HI>p.</HI> 203, 204.</NOTE> have el&s;ewhere &s;hew'd, require a &s;mall one in Compari&s;on of the Earth, whereas the re&s;t of the Comets &s;eem to have been commonly larger than it.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) None of their de&s;cending Orbits are duly &s;ituate, I mean between 90 and 100 Degrees from <HI>Aries:</HI> which Po&s;ition is yet ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in this Ca&s;e. For the Prece&s;&s;ion of the Equinox, which is about 50 Degrees, added to the 46 Degrees that the Earth was di&s;tant from <HI>Aries</HI> when the Flood began, mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the de&s;cending Orbit of the Comet to be now between 90 and 100 Degrees from <HI>Aries:</HI> at which place none of the de&s;cending Or|bits of the other Comets are now &s;ituate; as Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>'s Table, and my Solar Sy&s;tem grounded there|on, will readily &s;hew. (3.) None of the other's Nodes are &s;o &s;ituate, as is nece&s;&s;ary to bring the Comet near enough to our Earth: I mean between 90 or 100 Degrees from <HI>Aries;</HI> and &s;o as to cro&s;s the Plane of the Ecliptick very near to the Di&s;tance of the Earth from the Sun; as is al&s;o plain from the &s;ame Table and Sy&s;tem. Nay indeed, the wrong Situa|tion of the de&s;cending Orbits, noted under the la&s;t Head, renders this due Situation of the Nodes plain|ly impo&s;&s;ible. For it being nece&s;&s;ary, that the Or|bit it &s;elf inter&s;ect the Ecliptick it &s;elf in the 17^t^h Degree of <HI>Taurus;</HI> this cannot po&s;&s;ibly be in &s;uch a Situation of the Orbit, as that we have already mention'd to belong to all the re&s;t of the known Comets. So that the&s;e other Comets were utterly incapable of being in&s;trumental in the Deluge, even tho their Periods &s;hould any of them agree; which yet we know not that any of them do.</P>
<P N="2">II. This Comet was of the &s;ame Bigne&s;s with that which pa&s;s'd by at that time; I mean a very &s;mall one, and only 10 times as large as the Moon. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>&V;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="6+ letters"></HI></NOTE> This appears by Mr. <HI>Flam&s;teed</HI>'s Determination of its apparent Diameter, about 20&Prime; when it was near|ly
<PB N="5" REF="5">
as far off as the Sun: whereas he &s;uppo&s;es that of the Moon at the &s;ame Di&s;tance to be about 6&Prime;. So that if due Allowance be made for that large and den&s;e Part of the Atmo&s;phere, which hides the Nucleus or Comet it &s;elf from us, &s;uppo&s;e 7&Prime;, the Diameter of the &s;olid Body it &s;elf will be on|ly 13&Prime;. Now the Cube of 13, or 2197, is to the Cube of 6, or 216, as about 10 to 1. Whence it appears, that this Comet is about ten times &s;o great as the Moon, or &frac14; &s;o great as the Earth, as the real Comet that occa&s;ion'd the Deluge ought to be.</P>
<P N="3">III. The de&s;cending Part of the Orbit of this Comet was about the 17^t^h deg. of <HI>Taurus</HI> at the Time of the Deluge, as that of the Comet at the Deluge mu&s;t have been. For this de&s;cending Orbit is now in the 2^d Degree of <HI>Cancer;</HI> and if we allow 46 Degrees for its apparent Motion &s;ince the Deluge, which is very little different from the real Prece&s;&s;ion of the Equinox, the main, if not only Occa&s;ion of it, it will appear to have been in the 17^t^h Degree of <HI>Taurus</HI> at that Time, according to the foregoing Computation.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The De&s;cending Node of this Comet, which is of the greate&s;t Con&s;ideration here, and liable to the greate&s;t Variety of all, does al&s;o exceeding well agree in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e. For this is now in the 3^d Degree of <HI>Cancer;</HI> and if we allow, as before, 46 Degrees for its apparent Motion &s;ince the De|luge, or for the real Prece&s;&s;ion of the Equinox, the main, if not only Cau&s;e of it, it will appear to have been in the 17^t^h of <HI>Taurus</HI> at that Time al&s;o. Nay, if we allow the lea&s;t Inequality in the&s;e two Mo|tions, or the lea&s;t Alteration of the Planes either of the Ecliptick or of the Comets Orbit, or of both, as we ju&s;tly may, both from the Phy&s;ical Cau&s;es, and A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations, we may &s;uppo&s;e them &s;till nearer the Earth's Di&s;tance from the Sun, and &s;o more exactly &s;uitable to the Ca&s;e of the Deluge.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="6" REF="6">
V. The Period of this Comet mo&s;t exactly agrees to the &s;ame Time, I mean to 7 Revolutions in 4028 Years, the Interval from the Deluge till its la&s;t Ap|pearance 1680. <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">cip. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">5.</NOTE> For, as Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> fir&s;t ob|&s;erv'd, from its Elliptick Curvature before it di&s;ap|pear'd, that its Period mu&s;t be in general above 500 Years; &s;o has he and Dr. <HI>Halley</HI> &s;ince ob&s;erv'd, that the &s;ame Comet has been &s;een four times, <HI>viz.</HI> the 44^t^h Year before Chri&s;t. <HI>A.D.</HI> 531 or 532, <HI>A.D.</HI> 1106, and <HI>A.D.</HI> 1680, and that by con&s;equence it makes a Revolution in about 575 Years. Now if we make a very &s;mall Allowance for the old Periods be|fore Chri&s;t, and &s;uppo&s;e that, one with another, it has revolv'd in 575&frac12; Years, we &s;hall find that 7 &s;uch Periods amount to 4028 Years, exactly, according to that Number &s;ince the Deluge. This is &s;o remarkable an Ob&s;ervation, and &s;o &s;urprizing, that it will de|&s;erve a particular Demon&s;tration from the original Authors them&s;elves.

Plutarch</HI>'s, <HI>Seneca</HI>'s and <HI>Suetonius</HI>'s Words are almo&s;t the very &s;ame that are included in the Pa&s;|&s;age from <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and &s;o need not be di&s;tinctly &s;et down. Only the Time of its Ri&s;ing is by <HI>Suetonius</HI> &s;et down <HI>about the</HI> 11<HI>th Hour,</HI> without the Words <HI>of the Day,</HI> which the other two have; and its <HI>Northern</HI> Po&s;ition is only mentioned by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> him&s;elf. Now if we interpret the 11^t^h Hour, or 11^t^h Hour of the Day, to be either 11 a clock before Noon, or an Hour before Sun-&s;et, this will render the whole almo&s;t incredible: it being next to impo&s;&s;ible, that this Comet &s;hould be &s;een in the Day-time. But the <HI>Romans</HI> then accounting Midnight the Beginning of their Day, as is well known by Chronologers, we may reckon this 11^t^h Hour to be 11 at Night, and all will agree to the Comet before us; and it will &s;hew, that as it had been conceal'd by cloudy Weather for &s;ome time, &s;o it now appear'd a&s;cending from the Sun, with its long and &s;plendid Tail for a Week, before the like cloudy Weather, or the Comet's too great Remotene&s;s rendred it no longer ob&s;ervable. Ac|cordingly the <HI>Northern</HI> Po&s;ition of this Comet, no|ted here by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;ecures us &s;till farther, that it mu&s;t have been the &s;ame with that <HI>A.D.</HI> 1680, which is ever in the &s;ame Po&s;ition, at the &s;ame Place of its Orbit: to &s;ay nothing of its remarkable Brightne&s;s, which I take to belong to its Tail, and which ren|dred it &s;o very remarkable then in the World: In which Point it as well or better agrees with this, than with any other in the whole Cometary Sy&s;tem. So that on all the&s;e Accounts, the Comet &s;een then by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and that &s;een <HI>A.D.</HI> 1680, mu&s;t have been one and the &s;ame Comet. The next Period

when this Comet might be &s;een again, according to the foregoing Time of its Revolution, was <HI>A.D.</HI> 531, or 532. When yet we hear nothing of it in <HI>Hevelius</HI>'s Hi&s;tory of Comets.

And if we reckon backward &s;uch another Period, we &s;hall come to the 44th Year before <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> in which <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was murder'd, and in which there appear'd a very remarkable Comet, mentioned by almo&s;t all the Hi&s;torians of tho&s;e Times, and by <HI>Pliny</HI> in his Natural Hi&s;tory, <HI>lib.</HI> 11. <HI>c.</HI> 24. who recites the Words of <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI> on this Occa&s;ion, which lead us to the very Time of its Appear|ance, and its Situation in the Heavens.

&s;een only tho&s;e 7 Days, but po&s;&s;ibly both before and after. Nor are we to interpret the Words <HI>&s;ub Septentrionibus,</HI> as if the Comet had appear'd in the <HI>North,</HI> but that it was &s;een under the <HI>Sep|tem triones,</HI> or brighter Stars of <HI>Ur&s;a major.</HI> And as to its ri&s;ing <HI>Hora undecima diei,</HI> it can no ways be under&s;tood, unle&s;s the word <HI>diei</HI> be left out, as it is by <HI>Suetonius;</HI> for it mu&s;t have been very far from the Sun, either to ri&s;e at Five in the Afternoon, or at Eleven at Night; in which Ca&s;es it mu&s;t have appeared for a long time, and its Tail have been &s;o little remarkable, that it could by no means be call'd, <HI>Clarum &amp; omnibus Terris con&s;picuum Sydus.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;ing this Co|met to have traced the &s;ame Path with that of the Year 1680, the a&s;cending part of the Orb will exactly repre&s;ent all that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> hath &s;aid concerning it; and is yet an additional Argu|ment to that drawn from the Equality of the Period. Thus 'tis not improbable but this Co|met may have four times vi&s;ited us at Intervals of about 575 Years: Whence the Tran&s;ver&s;e Diameter of its Elliptic Orb will be found &radic;^3575^&times;575 times greater than the annual Orb; or 138 times greater than the mean Di&s;tance of the Sun; which Di&s;tance, tho' immen&s;ely great, bears no Proportion to that of the Fixed Stars."</Q></P>
