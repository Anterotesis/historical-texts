<P>_ANGRY!&mdash;What &s;hould I be angry for?&mdash;I am mightily plea&s;ed with your freedom, as you call it. I only wonder at your patience with me; that's all. I am &s;orry I gave you the trouble of &s;o long a letter upon the occa&s;ion <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Letter <HI>XXXVII,</HI> in the preceding Volume, for the occa&s;ion: And Letters <HI>XXXVIII, XL,</HI> in the &s;ame, for the freedoms Mi&s;s Harlowe apologizes for.</NOTE>; notwith&s;tanding the plea&s;ure I received in reading it.</P>
<P>I believe, you did not intend re&s;erves to me: For two rea&s;ons, I believe you did not: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e you <HI>&s;ay,</HI> you did not: Next, becau&s;e you have not, <HI>as yet,</HI> been able to convince <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> how it is to be
<PB N="2" REF="3">
with you; and, per&s;ecuted as you are, how &s;o to &s;e|parate the effects that &s;pring from the two cau&s;es (<HI>Per&s;ecution</HI> and <HI>Love</HI>), as to give to each its particular due. But this I believe I hinted to you once before. And &s;o will &s;ay no more upon that &s;ubject at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Robin &s;ays, you had but ju&s;t depo&s;ited your la&s;t parcel when he took it: For he was there, but half an hour before, and found nothing. He had &s;een my impatience; and loiter'd about, being willing to bring me &s;omething from you, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>My cou&s;in Jenny Fynnett is here, and de&s;ires to be my bedfellow to-hight. So I &s;hall not have an opportunity to &s;it down with that &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and at|tention, which the &s;ubjects of yours require. For, &s;he is all prate, you know, and loves to &s;et me a prating: Yet comes upon a very grave occa&s;ion:&mdash;On purpo&s;e to procure my mamma to go with her to her grand|mother Larkin, who has been long bed-ridden; and, at la&s;t, has taken it into her head, that &s;he is mortal; and therefore will make her will; a work &s;he was, till now, extremely aver&s;e to; but it mu&s;t be upon condition, that my mamma, who is her di&s;tant re|lation, will go to her, and advi&s;e her, as to the par|ticulars of it: For, &s;he has a high opinion, as every one el&s;e has, of my mamma's judgment in all matters relating to wills, &s;ettlements, and &s;uch-like notable affairs.</P>
<P>Mrs. Larkin lives about &s;eventeen miles off; and as my mamma cannot abide to lie out of her own hou&s;e, &s;he propo&s;es to &s;et out early in the morning, in order to get back again at night. So, to-morrow I &s;hall be at your devotion from day-light to day-light; nor will I be at home to any-body.</P>
<P>As to the impertinent man, I have put him upon e&s;corting the two ladies, in order to attend my mamma home at night: Such expeditions as the&s;e, and to give our &s;ex a little air of vanity and a&s;&s;uredne&s;s at public places, is all that I know the&s;e dangling fellows are good for.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">I have hinted before, that I could almo&s;t wi&s;h my mamma and Mr. Hickman would make a match of it: And I here repeat my wi&s;hes. What &s;ignifies a difference of fifteen or twenty years; e&s;pecially when the Lady has &s;pirits that will make her young a long time, and the gentleman is a <HI>mighty</HI> &s;ober man?&mdash;I think verily, I could like him better for a papa, than for a nearer relation: And they are &s;trange admirers of one another.</P>
<P>But allow me a perhaps &s;till better (and, as to <HI>years,</HI> more &s;uitable and happier) di&s;po&s;al; for the <HI>man</HI> at lea&s;t:&mdash;What think you, my dear, of compromizing with your friends, by rejecting <HI>both</HI> your men, and encouraging my parader?&mdash;If your liking of one of the two go no farther than <HI>conditional,</HI> I believe it will do.&mdash;A rich thought, if it obtain your appro|bation. In this light, I &s;hould have a prodigious re|&s;pect for Mr. Hickman; more by half than I can have in the other. The vein is open'd&mdash;Shall I let it flow?&mdash;How difficult to with&s;tand con&s;titutional foibles!&mdash;</P>
<P>Hickman, is certainly a man more in your ta&s;te, than any of tho&s;e who have hitherto been brought to ad|dre&s;s you. He is mighty &s;ober! mighty grave! and all that. Then you have told me, that he is your fa|vourite!&mdash;But that is, becau&s;e he is my mamma's, perhaps.&mdash;The man would certainly rejoice at the transfer: Or he mu&s;t be a greater fool than I take him to be.</P>
<P>O but your fierce lover would knock him o' the head&mdash;I forgot that!&mdash;What makes me incapable of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s when I write about this Hickman?&mdash;Yet the man &s;o good a &s;ort of man in the main?&mdash;But who is perfect? This is one of my foibles. And &s;omething for you to chide me for.</P>
<P>You believe me very happy in my pro&s;pects, in relation to him: Becau&s;e you are &s;o very unhappy in the fooli&s;h u&s;age you meet with, you are apt (as I &s;u|&s;pect) to think that tolerable which otherwi&s;e would
<PB N="4" REF="5">
be far from being &s;o. I dare &s;ay, you would not with all your grave airs, like him for your&s;elf; except being addre&s;&s;ed by Solmes and him, you were obliged to have one of them. I have given you a te&s;t; let me &s;ee what you'll &s;ay to it.</P>
<P>For my own part, I confe&s;s to you, that I have great exceptions to Hickman. <HI>He,</HI> and <HI>wedlock</HI> never yet once enter'd into my head at one time. Shall I give you my free thoughts of him?&mdash;Of his <HI>be&s;t</HI> and his <HI>wor&s;t</HI>; and that as if I were writing to one, who knows him not? I think I will. Yet it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould do it gravely. The &s;ubject won't bear to be &s;o treated, in my opinion. We are not come &s;o far as that yet, if ever we &s;hall? And to do it in another &s;train, ill becomes my pre&s;ent real concern for you.</P>
<P>HERE I was interrupted on the hone&s;t man's ac|count. He has been here the&s;e two hours&mdash;courting my mamma for her daughter, I &s;uppo&s;e&mdash;Yet &s;he wants no courting neither: Tis well one of us does; el&s;e the man would have nothing but halcyon; and be remi&s;s, and &s;aucy of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>He was going. His hor&s;es at the door.</P>
<P>My mamma &s;ent for me down, pretending to want to &s;ay &s;omething to me.</P>
<P>Something &s;he &s;aid when I came, that &s;ignify'd no|thing&mdash;Evidently, for no rea&s;on called me, but to give me an opportunity to &s;ee what a fine bow he could make; and that he might wi&s;h me a good-night. She knows I am not over-ready to oblige him with my pre&s;ence, if I happen to be otherwi&s;e engag'd. I could not help an air a little upon the fretful, when I found &s;he had nothing of moment to &s;ay to me, and when I &s;aw her end.</P>
<P>She &s;miled off the vi&s;ible fretfulne&s;s, that the man might go away in good humour with him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He bow'd to the ground, and would have taken my hand, his whip in the other: I did not like to
<PB N="5" REF="6">
be &s;o companion'd: I withdrew my hand, but touched his elbow with a motion, as if from his low bow I had &s;uppo&s;ed him falling, and would have help'd him up. A &s;ad &s;lip, it might have been, &s;aid I!</P>
<P>A mad girl, &s;mil'd it off my mamma!</P>
<P>He was put quite out; took his hor&s;e-bridle, &s;tump'd back, back, back, bowing, till he run again&s;t his &s;ervant: I laughed; he mounted his hor&s;e; rid away: I mounted up &s;tairs, after a little lecture.&mdash;And my head is &s;o filled with him, that I mu&s;t re&s;ume my intention; in hopes to divert you for a few moments.</P>
<P>Take it then&mdash;His <HI>be&s;t,</HI> and his <HI>wor&s;t,</HI> as I &s;aid before.</P>
<P>Hickman is a &s;ort of fiddling, bu&s;y, yet to borrow a word from you, <HI>un</HI>-bu&s;y man: Has a great deal to do, and &s;eems to me to di&s;patch nothing. Irre&s;olute, and changeable in every thing, but in teazing me with his non&s;en&s;e; which yet, it is evident, he mu&s;t continue upon my mamma's intere&s;t, more than his own hopes; for none have I given him.</P>
<P>Then I have a quarrel again&s;t his face, though in his per&s;on, for a well-thriven man, tolerably genteel:&mdash;Not to his features &s;o much neither&mdash;For what, as you have often ob&s;erved, are features in a man?&mdash;But Hickman, with &s;trong lines, and big cheek and chin bones, has not the manline&s;s in his a&s;pect, which Lovelace has with the mo&s;t regular and agreeable features.</P>
<P>Then what a &s;et and formal mortal is he in &s;ome things!&mdash;I have not been able yet to laugh him out of his long bib and beads: Indeed, that is, becau&s;e my mamma thinks it becomes him; and I would not be &s;o free with him, as to own I &s;hould <HI>choo&s;e</HI> to have him leave it off. If he did, &s;o particular is the man, he would certainly, if left to him&s;elf, fall into a King-William-Cravat, or &s;ome &s;uch antique chin-cu&s;hion, as, by the pictures of that Prince, one &s;ees was then the fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>As to his dre&s;s, in general, he cannot, indeed, be
<PB N="6" REF="7">
called a &s;loven, but &s;ometimes he is too gaudy, at other times too plain, to be uniformly elegant. And for his manners, he makes &s;uch a bu&s;tle with them, and about them, as would induce one to &s;u&s;pect that they are more &s;trangers to him, than familiars. You, I know, lay this to his fearfulne&s;s of di&s;obliging, or offending. Indeed your <HI>Over-does</HI> generally give the offence they endeavour to avoid.</P>
<P>The man, however, is hone&s;t: Is of family: Has a clear and good e&s;tate; and may one day be a Ba|ronet, and plea&s;e you. He is humane and benevolent, tolerably generous, as people &s;ay; and as <HI>I</HI> might &s;ay too, if I would accept of his bribes; which he offers in hopes of having them all back again, and the <HI>bribed</HI> into the bargain: A method taken by all corruptors, from old Satan, to the lowe&s;t of his &s;ervants.&mdash;Yet, to &s;peak in the language of a per&s;on I am bound to honour, he is deemed a <HI>prudent</HI> man; that is, a <HI>good manager.</HI></P>
<P>Then, I cannot &s;ay, that now I like any-body better, whatever I did once.</P>
<P>He is no fox-hunter: Keeps a pack indeed, but prefers not his hounds to his fellow-creatures. No bad &s;ign for a wife, I own. Loves his hor&s;e, but di&s;likes racing in a gaming way, as well as all &s;orts of gaming. Then he is &s;ober; mode&s;t; They <HI>&s;ay,</HI> vir|tuous; in &s;hort, has qualities that mothers would be fond of in a hu&s;band for their daughters; and for which, perhaps, their daughters would be the happier could they judge as well for them&s;elves, as experience, po&s;&s;ibly, may teach <HI>them</HI> to judge for their <HI>future</HI> daughters.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, to own the truth, I cannot &s;ay I love the man; nor ever &s;hall, I believe.</P>
<P>Strange! that the&s;e &s;ober fellows cannot have a decent &s;prightline&s;s, a mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance with them! Something debonnaire; which need not be &s;eparated from that awe and reverence, when they addre&s;s a
<PB N="7" REF="8">
woman, which &s;hould &s;hew the ardor of their pa&s;&s;ion, rather than the &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s of their nature; for who knows not, that Love delights in taming the Lyon-hearted? That tho&s;e of the &s;ex, who are mo&s;t con|&s;cious of their own defect, in point of courage, na|turally <HI>require,</HI> and therefore <HI>as</HI> naturally <HI>prefer,</HI> the man who has mo&s;t of it, as the mo&s;t able to give them the requi&s;ite protection? That the greater their own cowardice, as it would be called in a man, the greater is their delight in &s;ubjects of heroi&s;m? As may be ob&s;erved in their reading; which turns upon difficulties encounter'd, battles fought, and enemies overcome, 4 or 500 by the prowe&s;s of one &s;ingle hero, the <HI>more</HI> improbable the <HI>better:</HI> In &s;hort, that <HI>their</HI> man &s;hould be a hero to every one living but them&s;elves; and to them know no bound to his hu|mility. A woman has &s;ome glory in &s;ubduing a heart no man living can appall; and hence too often the bravo, a&s;&s;uming the hero, and making him&s;elf pa&s;s for one, &s;ucceeds as only a hero &s;hould.</P>
<P>But as for hone&s;t Hickman, the good man is &s;o <HI>generally</HI> meek, as I imagine, that I know not whe|ther I have any <HI>preference</HI> paid me in his ob&s;equi|ou&s;ne&s;s. And then, when I rate him, he &s;eems to be &s;o naturally fitted for rebuke, and &s;o much expects it, that I know not how to di&s;appoint him, whether he ju&s;t then de&s;erve it, or not. I am &s;ure, he has puzzled me many a time when I have &s;een him look penitent for faults he has not committed, whether to pity or laugh at him.</P>
<P>You and I have often <HI>retro&s;pected</HI> the faces and minds of grown people; that is to &s;ay, have formed images from their pre&s;ent appearances, out&s;ide and in, (as far as the manners of the per&s;ons would ju&s;tify us in the latter) what &s;ort of figures they made when boys and girls. And I'll tell you the lights in which Hickman, Solmes, and Lovelace, our three heroes, have appeared to me, &s;uppo&s;ing them boys at &s;chool.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">Solmes I have imagin'd to be, a little, &s;ordid, pil|fering rogue, who would purloin from every-body, and beg every boy's bread and butter from him; while, as I have heard a reptile brag, he would in a winter-morning, &s;pit upon his thumbs, and &s;pread his own with it, that he might keep it all to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Hickman, a great over-grown, lank-hair'd, chubby boy, who would be hunch'd and punch'd by every-body; and go home, with his finger in his eye, and tell his mother.</P>
<P>While Lovelace I have &s;uppo&s;ed a curl-pated villain, full of fire, fancy, and mi&s;chief; an orchard-robber, a wall-climber, a hor&s;e-rider without &s;addle or bridle, neck or nothing: A &s;turdy rogue, in &s;hort, who would kick and cuff, and do no right, and take no wrong of any-body; would get his head broke, then a plai&s;ter for it, or let it heal of it&s;elf; while he went on to do more mi&s;chief, and if not to get, to de&s;erve, broken bones. And the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions have grown up with them, and di&s;tingui&s;h the men, with no very material alteration.</P>
<P>Only, that all men are monkeys more or le&s;s, or el&s;e that you and I &s;hould have &s;uch baboons as the&s;e to choo&s;e out of, is a mortifying thing, my dear.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, that I am not a little out of &s;ea&s;on in treating thus ludicrou&s;ly the &s;ubject I am upon, while you are &s;o unhappy; and if my manner does not divert you, as my flightine&s;&s;es u&s;ed to do, I am inexcu&s;able both to you, and to my own heart: Which, I do a&s;&s;ure you, notwith&s;tanding my &s;eeming levity, is, wholly in your ca&s;e.</P>
<P>As this letter is intirely whim&s;ical, I will not &s;end it until I can accompany it with &s;omething more &s;olid and better &s;uited to your unhappy circum&s;tances; that is to &s;ay, to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject of our corre&s;pondence.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day Morn. 7 o'Clock.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY mamma and cou&s;in are already gone off in our chariot and four, attended by their doughty 'Squire on hor&s;eback, and he by two of his own &s;er|vants, and one of my mamma's. They both love parade, when they go abroad, at lea&s;t in compliment to one another; which &s;hews, that each thinks the other does. Robin is your &s;ervant and mine, and nobody's el&s;e: And the day is all my own.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t begin with blaming you, my dear, for your re&s;olution not to litigate for your right, if occa&s;ion were to be given you. Ju&s;tice is due to one's &s;elf, as well as to every-body el&s;e. Still more mu&s;t I blame you for declaring to your aunt and &s;i&s;ter that you will <HI>not:</HI> Since (as they will tell it to your father and brother) the declaration mu&s;t needs give advan|tages to &s;pirits who have &s;o little of that genero&s;ity for which you your&s;elf are &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>There never was a &s;pirit in the world that would in&s;ult where it <HI>dared,</HI> but it would creep and cringe where it dared <HI>not.</HI> Let me remind you of a &s;entence of your own, the occa&s;ion for which I have forgotten:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That little Spirits will always accommodate them|&s;elves to the &s;ubject they would work upon:&mdash;Will &s;awn upon a &s;turdy-temper'd per&s;on: Will in&s;ult the meek:'</Q>
And another given to Mi&s;s Biddulph, upon an occa&s;ion you cannot forget:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'If we a&s;&s;ume a dignity in what we &s;ay and do; and take care not to di&s;grace by arrogance our own a&s;&s;umption, every-body will treat us with re&s;pect and deference.'</Q></P>
<P>I remember that you once made an ob&s;ervation, which you &s;aid, you was obliged to Mrs. Norton for, and &s;he to her father, upon an excellent preacher,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
who was but an indifferent liver:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That to excell in theory, and to excell in practice, generally required different talents; which not always met in the &s;ame per&s;on.'</Q>
Do you, my dear (to whom theory and practice are the &s;ame thing, in almo&s;t every laudable quality) apply the ob&s;ervation to your&s;elf, in this particular ca&s;e, where Re&s;olution is required; and where performance of the will of the defunct is the que&s;tion&mdash;No more to be di&s;pen&s;ed with by <HI>you,</HI> in who&s;e favour it was made, than by any-body el&s;e, who have only Them&s;elves in view, by breaking thro' it.</P>
<P>I know how much you de&s;pi&s;e riches in the main: But yet it behoves you to remember, that in one in|&s;tance you your&s;elf have judged them valuable&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'In that they put it into one's power to <HI>lay</HI> obligations; while the want of them puts a per&s;on under a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of <HI>receiving</HI> favours; receiving them, perhaps from grudging and narrow &s;pirits, who know not how to confer them with that grace, which gives the principal merit to a beneficent action.'</Q>
&mdash;Reflect upon this, my dear, and &s;ee how it agrees with the declaration you have made to your aunt and &s;i&s;ter, that you would not re&s;ume your e&s;tate, were you to be turned out of doors, and reduced to indigence and want. Their very fears that you will re&s;ume, point out to you the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of re&s;uming, upon the treat|ment you meet with.</P>
<P>I own, that I was much affected (at fir&s;t reading) with your mamma's letter &s;ent with the patterns!&mdash;A &s;trange mea&s;ure, however, from a mother; for <HI>&s;he</HI> did not intend to in&s;ult you; and I cannot but la|ment that &s;o &s;en&s;ible and &s;o fine a Lady &s;hould &s;toop to &s;o much art, as that letter is written with: And which al&s;o appears in &s;ome of the conver&s;ations you have given me an account of. See you not in her pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s, what boi&s;trous &s;pirits can obtain from gentler, merely by teazing and ill-nature?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">I know the pride they have always taken in calling you an Harlowe&mdash;<HI>Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe,</HI> &s;o <HI>formal</HI> and &s;o <HI>&s;et,</HI> at every word, when they are grave, or proudly &s;olemn.&mdash;Your mamma has learnt it of them&mdash;And as in <HI>marriage,</HI> &s;o in <HI>will,</HI> has been taught to bury her own &s;uperior name and family in theirs. I have often thought that the &s;ame &s;pirit govern'd them, in this piece of affectation, and others of the like nature (as <HI>Harlowe</HI>-Place, and &s;o-forth, tho' not the elder brother's or paternal &s;eat) as govern'd the tyrant Tudor <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> VII.</NOTE>, who marrying Elizabeth, the Heire&s;s of the Hou&s;e of York, made him&s;elf a title to a throne, which he would not otherwi&s;e have had (being but a ba&s;e de&s;cendant of the Lanca&s;ter Line); and proved a gloomy and vile hu&s;band to her; for no other cau&s;e, than becau&s;e &s;he had laid him under obligations, which his pride would not permit him to own.&mdash;Nor would the unprincely wretch marry her till he was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the crown, that he might not be &s;uppo&s;ed to owe it to her claim.</P>
<P>You have chidden me, and again will, I doubt not, for the liberties I take with &s;ome of your re|lations. But, my dear, need I tell <HI>you,</HI> That pride in <HI>our&s;elves</HI> mu&s;t, and for-ever will, provoke con|tempt, and bring down upon us aba&s;ement from <HI>others?</HI>&mdash;Have we not, in the ca&s;e of a celebrated Bard, ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e who aim at more than their due, will be refu&s;ed the honours that they may ju&s;tly claim?&mdash;I am very loth to offend you; yet I cannot help &s;peaking of <HI>them,</HI> as well as of <HI>others,</HI> as I think they de&s;erve. <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> or <HI>Di&s;prai&s;e,</HI> is the Reward or Puni&s;hment which the world confers or inflicts on <HI>Merit</HI> or <HI>Demerit</HI>; and, for my part, I neither can nor will confound them in the ap|plication.

in the pre&s;ent contention&mdash;She who has for &s;o many years, and with &s;uch ab&s;olute re&s;ignation, borne what &s;he has borne, to the &s;acrifice of her own will, may think it an ea&s;ier ta&s;k, than another per&s;on can ima|gine it, for her daughter to give up <HI>her</HI>'s.&mdash;But to think to who&s;e in&s;tigation all this is originally owing&mdash;God forgive me; but with &s;uch u&s;age I &s;hould have been with Lovelace before now&mdash;Yet remember, my dear, that the &s;tep which would not be wonder'd at from &s;uch an ha&s;ty-temper'd creature as me, would be inexcu&s;able in &s;uch a con&s;iderate per&s;on as you.</P>
<P>After your mamma has been thus drawn in again&s;t her judgment, I am the le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed, that your aunt Hervey &s;hould go along with her; &s;ince the two &s;i&s;ters never &s;eparate. I have inquired into the nature of the obligation which Mr. Hervey's indifferent con|duct in his affairs has laid him under:&mdash;It is only, it &s;eems, that your brother has paid off for him a mortgage upon one part of his e&s;tate, which the mortgagee was about to foreclo&s;e; and taken it upon him&s;elf: A &s;mall favour (as he has ample &s;ecurity in his hands) from kindred to kindred: But &s;uch a one, it is plain, as has laid the whole family of the Herveys under obligation to the ungenerous lender; who has treated him, and his aunt too (as Mi&s;s Dolly Hervey has privately complain'd) with the le&s;s ceremony ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I, my dear, call &s;uch a creature your <HI>brother?</HI>&mdash;I believe I mu&s;t&mdash;Becau&s;e he is your <HI>father</HI>'s <HI>&s;on.</HI> There is no harm, I hope, in &s;aying That.</P>
<P>I am concerned, that you ever wrote at all to him. It was taking too much notice of him: It was adding to his &s;elf-&s;ignificance; and a call upon him to treat you with in&s;olence: A call which you might have been a&s;&s;ured he would not fail to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>But &s;uch a pretty ma&s;ter as this, to run riot again&s;t &s;uch a man as Lovelace; who had taught him to put his &s;word into his &s;cabbard, when he had pulled it
<PB N="13" REF="14">
out by accident!&mdash;The&s;e in-door in&s;olents, who, turning them&s;elves into bugbears, frighten women, children, and &s;ervants, are generally cravens among men. Were he to come fairly cro&s;s me, and &s;ay to my face &s;ome of the free things, which, I am told, he has &s;aid of me behind my back, or that (as by your account) he has &s;aid of our &s;ex, I would take upon my&s;elf to a&s;k him two or three que&s;tions; altho' he were to &s;end me a challenge likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>I repeat, You know that I will &s;peak my mind, and <HI>write</HI> it too. He is not <HI>my</HI> brother. Can you &s;ay, he is <HI>yours?</HI>&mdash;So, for your life, if you are ju&s;t, you can't be angry with me: For would you &s;ide with a <HI>fal&s;e brother</HI> again&s;t a <HI>true friend?</HI> A brother may <HI>not</HI> be a friend: But a friend will be <HI>always</HI> a brother.&mdash;<HI>Mind That,</HI> as your uncle <HI>Tony</HI> &s;ays!</P>
<P>I cannot de&s;cend &s;o low, as to take very particular notice of the epi&s;tles of tho&s;e poor &s;ouls, whom you call <HI>uncles.</HI>&mdash;Yet I love to divert my&s;elf with &s;uch grote&s;que characters too.&mdash;But I know <HI>them,</HI> and love <HI>you</HI>; and &s;o cannot make the je&s;t of them, which their ab&s;urdities call for.</P>
<P>Now I have &s;aid &s;o much on the&s;e <HI>touching</HI> topics, (as I am but too &s;en&s;ible you will think them) I mu&s;t add one reflection more, and &s;o intitle my&s;elf to your correction for all at once.&mdash;It is upon the conduct of tho&s;e women (for you and I know more than <HI>one</HI> &s;uch) who can &s;uffer them&s;elves to be out-blu&s;ter'd and out-gloom'd, till they have no <HI>will</HI> of their own; in&s;tead of being prevailed upon, by acts of tenderne&s;s and complai&s;ance, to be <HI>fooled out of it.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h, that it does not demon&s;trate too evidently, that, with &s;ome of the &s;ex, in&s;olent controul is a more efficacious &s;ubduer than kindne&s;s or conce&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Upon my life, my dear, I have often thought, that many of us are mere babies in matrimony: Perver&s;e fools, when too much indulg'd and humour'd; creeping &s;laves, when treated har&s;hly. But &s;hall it be &s;aid, that <HI>fear</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="15">
makes us more gentle obligers than <HI>love?</HI>&mdash;Forbid it, honour! forbid it, gratitude! forbid it, ju&s;tice! that any woman of &s;en&s;e &s;hould give occa&s;ion to have this &s;aid of her!</P>
<P>Did I think you would have any manner of doubt, from the &s;tyle or contents of this letter, who&s;e &s;aucy pen it is that has run on at this rate, I would write my name at length; &s;ince it comes too much from my heart to di&s;avow it:&mdash;But at pre&s;ent the initials &s;hall &s;erve; and I will go on again directly.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day morn. 10 o' clock (Mar.  23).</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Will po&s;tpone, or perhaps pa&s;s by, &s;everal ob&s;erva|tions which I had to make on other parts of your letters; to acquaint you, that Mr. Hickman, when in London, found an opportunity to inquire after Mr. Lovelace's town-life and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>At the Cocoa-tree in Pall-mall he fell in with two of his intimates, the one named Belton, the other Mowbray; very free of &s;peech, and raki&s;h gentlemen both: But the waiter, it &s;eems, paid them great re|&s;pect, and, on his inquiry after their characters, cal|led them men of fortune and honour.</P>
<P>They began to talk of Mr. Lovelace of their own accord; and upon &s;ome gentlemen in the room a&s;k|ing, when they expected him in town, an&s;wer'd, That very day. Mr. Hickman (as they both went on prai&s;ing Lovelace) &s;aid, He had indeed heard, that Mr. Lovelace was a very fine gentleman&mdash;and was pro|ceeding, when one of them, interrupting him, &s;aid,&mdash;Only, Sir, the fine&s;t gentleman in the world; that's all.</P>
<P>And &s;o he led them on to expatiate more particu|larly on his qualities; which they were very fond of
<PB N="15" REF="16">
doing: But &s;aid not one &s;ingle word in behalf of his morals&mdash;<HI>Mind that</HI> al&s;o, in your uncle's &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman &s;aid, That Mr. Lovelace was very happy, as he under&s;tood, in the e&s;teem of the Ladies; and, &s;miling, to make them believe he did not think ami&s;s of it, that he pu&s;h'd his good fortune as far as it would go.</P>
<P>Well put, Mr. Hickman! thought I; equally grave and &s;age&mdash;Thou &s;eeme&s;t not to be a &s;tranger to their dialect, as I &s;uppo&s;e this is!&mdash;But I &s;aid nothing; for I have often try'd to find out this <HI>mighty</HI> &s;ober man of my mamma's: But hitherto have only to &s;ay, that he is either very moral, or very cunning.</P>
<P>No doubt of it, reply'd one of them; and out came an oath, with a Who would not?&mdash;That he did as every young gentleman would&mdash;</P>
<P>Very true! &s;aid my mamma's puritan&mdash;But I hear he is in treaty with a fine lady&mdash;</P>
<P>So he was, Mr. Belton &s;aid&mdash;The d&mdash;I fetch her! (Vile brute!) for &s;he ingro&s;&s;ed all his time!&mdash;But that the Lady's family ought to be&mdash;&s;omething&mdash;(Mr. Hickman de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed repeating what,&mdash;tho' he had repeated what was wor&s;e)&mdash;and might dearly repent their u&s;age of a man of his family and merit.</P>
<P>Perhaps they may think him too wild a gentleman, cry'd Hickman: And theirs is, I hear, a very &s;ober family&mdash;</P>
<P>SOBER! &s;aid one of them: A good hone&s;t word, Dick!&mdash;Where the devil has it lain all this time?&mdash;D&mdash;me if I have heard of it in this &s;en&s;e, ever &s;ince I was at college! And then, &s;aid he, we bandy'd it about among twenty of us, as an ob&s;olete&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>There's for you, my dear!</HI>&mdash;The&s;e are Mr. Love|lace's companions: You'll be plea&s;ed to take <HI>notice of that!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Hickman &s;aid, this put him out of countenance.</P>
<P>I &s;tared at him, and with &s;uch a meaning in my
<PB N="16" REF="17">
eyes, as he knew how to take; and &s;o was out of countenance again.</P>
<P>Don't you remember, my dear, who it was that told a young gentleman de&s;igned for the gown, who own'd he was apt to be too ea&s;ily put out of countenance, when he came among free company;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That it was a bad &s;ign; that it looked as if his morals were not proof; but that his good di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemed rather the effect of accident and education, than of &s;uch a choice as was founded upon principle?'</Q>
And don't you know the le&s;&s;on the very &s;ame young Lady gave him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To endeavour to &s;tem and di&s;countenance vice, and to glory in being an advocate in all com|panies for virtue;'</Q>
particularly ob&s;erving,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That it was natural for a man to &s;hun, or give up, what he was a&s;hamed of?'</Q>
Which &s;he &s;hould be &s;orry to think his ca&s;e on this occa&s;ion: Adding,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That vice was a coward, and would hide its head, when oppo&s;ed by &s;uch a virtue as had pre&s;ence of mind, and a full per&s;ua&s;ion of its own rectitude, to &s;upport it.'</Q>
The Lady, you may remember, mode&s;tly put her doctrine into the mouth of a worthy preacher, Dr. Lewin, as &s;he u&s;es to do, when &s;he has a mind not to be thought to be what &s;he is at &s;o early an age; and that it may give more weight to any-thing <HI>&s;he hit upon, that might appear tolerable,</HI> was her mode&s;t manner of &s;peech.</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman, upon the whole, profe&s;&s;ed to me, upon his <HI>&s;econd recovery,</HI> that he had no rea&s;on to think well of Mr. Lovelace's morals, from what he heard of him in town: Yet his two intimates talked of his being <HI>more regular</HI> than he <HI>u&s;ed to be:</HI> That he had made a very good re&s;olution; <HI>That</HI> of old Tom Wharton was the expre&s;&s;ion, That he would never <HI>give</HI> a challenge, nor <HI>refu&s;e</HI> one; which they prai&s;ed in him highly: That, in &s;hort, he was a very brave fellow, and the charming'&s;t companion in the world:
<PB N="17" REF="18">
And would one day make a great figure in his coun|try; for there was nothing he was not capable of&mdash;</P>
<P>I am afraid that this is too true. And this, my dear, is all that Mr. Hickman could pick up about him: And is it not enough to determine &s;uch a mind as yours, if not <HI>already</HI> determined?</P>
<P>Yet it mu&s;t be &s;aid too, that if there be a woman in the world that can reclaim him, it is you. And, by your account of his behaviour in the interview be|tween you, I own I have &s;ome hope of him. At lea&s;t, This I will &s;ay, That all his arguments with you, then, &s;eem to be ju&s;t and right: And if you <HI>are</HI> to be his&mdash;But no more of That&punc; He cannot, after all, de&s;erve you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day afternoon, March 23.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AN unexpected vi&s;itor has turned the cour&s;e of my thoughts, and chang'd the &s;ubject I had intended to pur&s;ue. The only one for whom I would have di&s;pen&s;ed with my re&s;olution not to &s;ee any-body all the dedicated day: A vi&s;itor, whom, according to Mr. Hickman's report from the expectations of his libertine friends, I &s;uppo&s;ed to be in town.&mdash;Now, my dear, have I &s;aved my&s;elf the trouble of telling you, That it was your too-agreeable Rake. Our &s;ex is &s;aid to love to trade in &s;urprizes: Yet have I, by my over-promptitude, &s;urpri&s;ed my&s;elf out of mine.&mdash;I had intended, you mu&s;t know, to run twice the length, before I had &s;uffer'd you &s;o much as to gue&s;s who, and of which &s;ex, my vi&s;itor was: But &s;ince you have the di&s;covery at &s;o cheap a rate, you are welcome to it.</P>
<P>The end of his coming was, to engage my intere&s;t with my <HI>charming friend</HI>; and as he was &s;ure, that I
<PB N="18" REF="19">
knew all your mind, to acquaint him what he had to tru&s;t to. He mentioned what had pa&s;&s;ed in the inter|view between you:&mdash;But could not be &s;atisfy'd with the re&s;ult of it, and with the little &s;atisfaction he had obtained from you; the malice of your family to him increa&s;ing, and their cruelty to you not abating.&mdash;His heart, he told me, was in tumults, for fear you &s;hould be prevailed upon in favour of a man de&s;pi&s;ed by every-body. He gave me fre&s;h in&s;tances of indigni|ties ca&s;t upon him&s;elf by your uncles and brother; and declared, that if you &s;uffered your&s;elf to be forced into the arms of the man for who&s;e &s;ake he was loaded with unde&s;erved abu&s;es, you &s;hould be one of the younge&s;t, as you would be one of the lovelie&s;t, widows in Eng|land: And that he would moreover call your brother to account for the liberties he takes with his character to every-one he meets with.</P>
<P>He propo&s;ed &s;everal &s;chemes, for you to choo&s;e &s;ome one of them, in order to enable you to avoid the per&s;ecutions you labour under: One I will men|tion; That you will re&s;ume your e&s;tate; and if you find difficulties, that can be no otherwi&s;e &s;urmounted, that you will, either avowedly or privately, as he had propo&s;ed to you, accept of his aunt Lawrance's, or Lord M's, a&s;&s;i&s;tance to in&s;tate you in it. He declared, that, if you did, he would leave it ab&s;olutely to your own plea&s;ure afterwards, and to the advice which your cou&s;in Morden on his arrival &s;hould give you, whe|ther to encourage his addre&s;s, or not, as you &s;hall be convinced of the &s;incerity of the reformation which his enemies make him &s;o much want.</P>
<P>I had now a good opportunity to &s;ound him (as you wi&s;h'd Mr. Hickman would Lord M.), as to the con|tinued or dimini&s;hed favour of the Ladies, and of his Uncle, towards you, upon their being acquainted with the animo&s;ity of your relations to them, as well as to their kin&s;man. I took the opportunity; and he &s;ati&s;|fy'd me, by reading &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of a letter he had
<PB N="19" REF="20">
about him, from Lord M, That an alliance with you, and that on the foot of your own &s;ingle merit, would be the mo&s;t de&s;irable event to them, that could hap|pen: And &s;o far to the purpo&s;e of your wi&s;hed inquiry does his Lord&s;hip go, in this letter, that he a&s;&s;ures him, that whatever you &s;uffer in fortune from the violence of your relations, on <HI>his</HI> account, he and his &s;i&s;ters will join to make it up to him. And yet the reputation of a family &s;o &s;plendid, would, no doubt, in a ca&s;e of &s;uch importance to the honour of both, make them prefer a general con&s;ent.</P>
<P>I told him, as you your&s;elf I knew had done, that you were extremely aver&s;e to Mr. Solmes; and that, might you be left to your own choice, it would be the Single Life. As to him&s;elf, I plainly &s;aid, That you had great and ju&s;t objections to him, on the &s;core of his carele&s;s morals: That it was &s;urpri&s;ing, that young gentlemen, who gave them&s;elves the liberties he was &s;aid to take, &s;hould pre&s;ume to think, that, whenever they took it into their heads to marry, the mo&s;t virtuous and worthy of the &s;ex were to fall to their lot: That as to the Re&s;umption, it had been very &s;trongly urged by my&s;elf, and would be more; tho' you had been aver&s;e to it hitherto: That your chief reliance and hopes were upon your cou&s;in Mor|den: And that to &s;u&s;pend or gain time, till he arrived, was, as I believed, your principal aim.</P>
<P>I told him, That with regard to the mi&s;chief he threatened, neither the act nor the menace could &s;erve any end but theirs who per&s;ecuted you; as it would give them a pretence for carrying into effect their compul&s;atory projects; and that with the appro|bation of all the world; &s;ince he mu&s;t not think the public would give its voice in favour of a violent young man, of no extraordinary character as to morals, who &s;hould &s;eek to rob a family of eminence of a child &s;o valuable; and who threatened, if he could not obtain her in preference to a man cho&s;en by them&s;elves, that
<PB N="20" REF="21">
he would avenge him&s;elf upon them All, by acts of violence.</P>
<P>I added, That he was very much mi&s;taken, if he thought to intimidate <HI>you</HI> by &s;uch menaces: For that, tho' your di&s;po&s;ition was all &s;weetne&s;s, yet I knew not a &s;teadier temper in the world than yours; nor one more inflexible (as your friends had found, and would &s;till farther find, if they continued to give occa&s;ion for its exertion), whenever you thought your&s;elf in the right; and that you were dealt ungenerou&s;ly with, in matters of too much moment to be indifferent about. Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe, Mr. Lovelace, let me tell you, &s;aid I, timid as her fore&s;ight and prudence may make her in &s;ome ca&s;es, where &s;he apprehends dangers to tho&s;e &s;he loves, is above fear, in points where her ho|nour, and the true dignity of her &s;ex, are concerned.&mdash;In &s;hort, Sir, you mu&s;t not think to frighten Mi&s;s Cla|ri&s;&s;a Harlowe into &s;uch a mean or unworthy conduct, as only a weak or un&s;teady mind can be guilty of.</P>
<P>He was &s;o very far from intending to intimidate you, he &s;aid, that he be&s;ought me not to mention one word to you, of what had pa&s;&s;ed between us: That what he had hinted at, that carried the air of a me|nace, was owing to the fervor of his &s;pirits, rai&s;ed by his apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing all hope of you for ever; and on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that you were to be actually forced into the arms of a man you hated: That were this to be the ca&s;e, he mu&s;t own, that he &s;hould pay very little regard to the world, or its cen&s;ures: E&s;pe|cially as the menaces of &s;ome of your family now, and their triumph over him afterwards, would both pro|voke and warrant all the vengeance he could take.</P>
<P>He added, that all the countries in the world were alike to him, but on your account: So that whatever he &s;hould think fit to do, were you lo&s;t to <HI>him,</HI> he &s;hould have nothing to apprehend from the Laws of this.</P>
<P>I did not like the determined air he &s;poke this with: He is certainly, my dear, capable of great ra&s;hne&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">He palliated a little this fiercene&s;s (which by the way I warmly cen&s;ured) by &s;aying, That while you remain &s;ingle, he will bear all the indignities that &s;hall be ca&s;t upon him by your family. But would you throw your&s;elf, if you werer &s;till farther driven, into any other protection, if not his uncle's, or that of the ladies of his family (into my mamma's, &s;uppo&s;e); or would you go to London to private lodgings, where he would never vi&s;it you, unle&s;s he had your leave; and from whence you might make your own terms with your relations; he would be intirely &s;atisfy'd; and would, as he had &s;aid before, wait the effect of your cou&s;in's arrival, and your free determination, as to his own fate.&mdash;Adding, That he knew the family &s;o well, and how much fixed they were upon their mea&s;ures, as well as the ab&s;olute dependence they made upon your temper and principles, that he could not but apprehend the wor&s;t, while you remained in the power of their per&s;ua&s;ion and menaces.</P>
<P>We had a great deal of other di&s;cour&s;e: But as the reciting of the re&s;t would be but a repetition of many of the things that pa&s;&s;ed between you and him, in the interview between you in the woodhou&s;e, I refer my&s;elf to your memory on that occa&s;ion <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <HI>I.</HI> Letter <HI>xxxvi.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>And now, my dear, upon the whole, I think, it behoves you to make your&s;elf independent: All then will fall right. This man is a violent man. I &s;hould wi&s;h, methinks, that you &s;hould not have either him or Solmes. You will find, if you get out of your brother's and &s;i&s;ter's way, what you <HI>can</HI> or can-<HI>not</HI> do, with regard to either. If your relations per&s;i&s;t in their fooli&s;h &s;cheme, I think I will take his hint, and, at a proper opportunity, &s;ound my mamma. Mean time, let me have your clear opinion of, and rea&s;on|ings upon, the Re&s;umption, which I join with Love|lace in advi&s;ing. You can but &s;ee how your demand will work. To <HI>demand,</HI> is not to <HI>litigate.</HI> But be
<PB N="22" REF="23">
your re&s;olution what it will, do not by any means repeat, that you will not a&s;&s;ert your right. If they go on to give you provocation, you may have &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on to change your mind: And let them ex|pect that you <HI>will</HI> change it. They have not the genero&s;ity to treat you the better for di&s;claiming the power they know you have. <HI>That,</HI> I think, need not now be told you.</P>

<P>I will hone&s;tly tell you the motive for your going: It is a double one; fir&s;t, That they may be &s;ure, that you &s;hall not corre&s;pond with any-body they do not like; for they find from Mrs. Howe, that, by &s;ome means or other, you <HI>do</HI> corre&s;pond with her daughter; and, thro' her, perhaps with &s;omebody el&s;e: And next, That you may receive the vi&s;its of Mr. Solmes; which you have thought fit to refu&s;e to do here; by which means you have deprived your&s;elf of the opportunity of knowing <HI>whom</HI> and <HI>what</HI> you have hitherto refu&s;ed.</P>
<P>If after one fortnight's conver&s;ation with Mr. Solmes, and after you have heard what your friends &s;hall fur|ther urge in his behalf, unharden'd by clande&s;tine corre&s;pondencies, you &s;hall convince them, that Vir|gil's <HI>amor omnibus idem</HI> (for the application of which I refer you to the Georgic, as tran&s;lated by Dryden) is verify'd in you, as well as in the re&s;t of the animal creation; and that you cannot, or will not, forego your prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of the moral, the virtuous, the pious Lovelace (I would plea&s;e you if I could!), it will then be con&s;idered, whether to humour you, or to renounce you for ever.</P>
<P>It is hoped, that, as you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> go, you will go chearfully. Your uncle Antony will make every|thing at his hou&s;e agreeable to you. But indeed he
<PB N="24" REF="25">
won't promi&s;e, that he will not, at <HI>proper times,</HI> draw up the bridge.</P>
<P>Your vi&s;itors, be&s;ides Mr. Solmes, will be my&s;elf, if you permit me that honour; your &s;i&s;ter; and, as you behave to Mr. Solmes, your aunt Hervey, and your uncle Harlowe; and yet the two latter will hardly come neither, if they think it will be to hear your <HI>whining vocatives.</HI>&mdash;Betty Barnes will be your attendant: And, I mu&s;t needs tell you, Mi&s;s, that we none of us think the wor&s;e of the faithful maid, for your di&s;like of her: Which Betty, however, who would be glad to oblige you, laments as a misfortune.</P>
<P>Your an&s;wer is required, whether you <HI>chearfully</HI> con&s;ent to go? And your indulgent mamma bids me remind you from her, That a fortnight's vi&s;its from Mr. Solmes are all that is meant at pre&s;ent.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>So here is the ma&s;ter-&s;troke of my brother's policy! Called upon to con&s;ent to go to my uncle Antony's, <HI>avowedly</HI> to receive Mr. Solmes's vi&s;its!&mdash;A chapel!&mdash;A moated hou&s;e!&mdash;Deprived of the opportunity of corre&s;ponding with you!&mdash;or of any po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape, &s;hould violence be u&s;ed to compel me to be that odious man's!</P>
<P>Late as it was, when I received this in&s;olent letter, I wrote an an&s;wer to it directly, that it might be ready for the writer's time of ri&s;ing. I inclo&s;e the rough draught of it. You will &s;ee by it how much his vile hint from the Georgic, and his rude one of my <HI>whining vocatives,</HI> have &s;et me up. Be&s;ides, as the command to get ready to go to my uncle's is in the name of my father and uncles, it is but to &s;hew a piece of the art they accu&s;e me of, to re&s;ent the vile hint, I have &s;o much rea&s;on to re&s;ent, in order to palliate the refu&s;al of obeying, what would otherwi&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="26">
be interpreted an act of rebellion by my brother and &s;i&s;ter: For, it &s;eems plain to me, that they will work but half their ends, if they do not deprive me of my father's and uncles favour, altho' I &s;hould even comply with terms, which it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould ever comply with.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>YOU might have told me, Brother, in three lines, what the determination of my friends was; only, that then you would not have had room to di&s;play your pedantry by &s;o dete&s;table an allu&s;ion or reference to the Georgic. Give me leave to tell you, Sir, That if <HI>humanity</HI> were a branch of your &s;tudies at the Uni|ver&s;ity, it has not found a genius in you for ma&s;ter|ing it. Nor is either my Sex or my &s;elf, tho' a &s;i&s;ter, I &s;ee, intitled to the lea&s;t decency from a brother, who has &s;tudied, as it &s;eems, rather to cultivate the male|volence of his natural temper, than any tendency which one would have hoped his parentage, if not his education, might have given him, to a tolerable politene&s;s.</P>
<P>I doubt not, that you will take ami&s;s my freedom: But as you have de&s;erved it from me, I &s;hall be le&s;s and le&s;s concerned on that &s;core, as I &s;ee you are more and more intent to &s;hew your wit at the expence of ju&s;tice and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The time is, indeed, come, that I can no longer bear tho&s;e contempts and reflections, which a brother, lea&s;t of all men, is intitled to give. And let me beg of you one favour, officious Sir:&mdash;It is <HI>this,</HI> That you will not give your&s;elf any concern about a hu&s;|band for <HI>me,</HI> till I &s;hall have the forwardne&s;s to pro|po&s;e a wife to <HI>you.</HI> Pardon me, Sir; but I cannot help thinking, that could I have the art to <HI>get my papa</HI> of my &s;ide, I &s;hould have as much right to pre|&s;cribe for you, as you have for me.</P>
<P>As to the communication you make me, I mu&s;t take upon me to &s;ay, That altho' I will receive, as
<PB N="26" REF="27">
becomes me, any of my papa's commands; yet, as this &s;ignification is made me by a brother, who has &s;hewn of late &s;o much of an unbrotherly animo&s;ity to me (for no rea&s;on in the world that I know of, but that he believes he has, in me, <HI>one</HI> &s;i&s;ter too many for his intere&s;t) I think my&s;elf intitled to conclude, that &s;uch a letter as you have &s;ent me, is all your own&mdash;And of cour&s;e to declare, that, while I &s;o think it, I will not willingly, nor even without vio|lence, go to any place avowedly, to receive Mr. Solmes's vi&s;its.</P>
<P>I think my&s;elf &s;o much intitled to re&s;ent your in|famous hint, and this as well for the &s;ake of my Sex, as for my own, that I ought to declare, as I do, that I will not receive any more of your letters, unle&s;s commanded to do &s;o, by an authority I never will di&s;pute; except in a ca&s;e, where I think my <HI>future,</HI> as well as <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> happine&s;s concerned&mdash;And were &s;uch a ca&s;e to happen, I am &s;ure my father's har&s;h|ne&s;s will be le&s;s owing to him&s;elf, than to you; and to the &s;pecious ab&s;urdities of your ambitious and &s;elfi&s;h &s;chemes.&mdash;Very true, Sir!</P>
<P>One word more, provoked as I am, I will add: That had I been thought as really ob&s;tinate and per|ver&s;e, as of late I am &s;aid to be, I &s;hould not have been &s;o di&s;gracefully treated as I have been&mdash;Lay your hand upon your heart, Brother, and &s;ay, By who&s;e in&s;tigations&mdash;And examine what I have done to de&s;erve to be made thus unhappy, and to be obliged to &s;tyle my&s;elf,</P>

<P>PERMIT me, my ever-dear and honoured papa and mamma, in this manner to &s;urpri&s;e you into an <HI>audience</HI> (pre&s;uming This will be read to you) &s;ince I am deny'd the honour of writing to you di|rectly. Let me beg of you to believe, that nothing but the mo&s;t unconquerable di&s;like could make me &s;tand again&s;t your plea&s;ure. What are riches, what are &s;ettlements, to happine&s;s? Let me not thus cruelly be given up to a man my very &s;oul is aver&s;e to. Permit me to repeat, that I cannot <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> be his. Had I a &s;lighter notion of the matrimonial duty than I have, perhaps I might. But when I am to bear all the mi&s;ery, and That for <HI>life</HI>; when my <HI>heart</HI> is le&s;s concerned in this matter, than my <HI>&s;oul</HI>; my <HI>temporal,</HI> perhaps, than my <HI>future</HI> good; why &s;hould I be deny'd the liberty of <HI>refu&s;ing?</HI> That liberty is all I a&s;k.</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y for me to give way to hear Mr. Solmes talk for the mentioned fortnight, altho' it is im|po&s;&s;ible for me, &s;ay what he would, to get over my di&s;like to him.

And why does my brother &s;ay, my re&s;traint is to be taken off (and that too at Mr. Solmes's de&s;ire), when I am to be a &s;till clo&s;er pri&s;oner than before; the Bridge threaten'd to be drawn up; and no dear papa and mamma near me, to appeal to, in the la&s;t re&s;ort?</P>
<P>Transfer not, I be&s;eech you, to a brother and &s;i&s;ter your own authority over your child&mdash;To a bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter, who treat me with unkindne&s;s and re|proach; and, as I have too much rea&s;on to appre|hend, mi&s;repre&s;ent my words and behaviour; or, greatly favour'd as I u&s;ed to be, it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould be &s;unk &s;o low in your opinions, as I un|happily am!</P>
<P>Let but this my hard, my di&s;graceful confinement be put an end to. Permit me, my dear mamma, to pur&s;ue my Needleworks in your pre&s;ence, as one of your maidens, and you &s;hall be witne&s;s, that it is not wilfulne&s;s or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that governs me.

<P>Forgive me, Brother, that thus, with an appearance of art, I addre&s;s my&s;elf to my father and mother, to whom, I am forbid to approach, or to write.

<P>I Send you the boa&s;ted confutation-letter, ju&s;t now put into my hands&mdash;My brother and &s;i&s;ter, my uncle Antony and Mr. Solmes are, I under&s;tand, ex|ulting over the copy of it below, as an unan&s;werable performance.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONCE again, my inflexible &s;i&s;ter, I write to you&punc; It is to let you know, that the pretty piece of art you found out to make me the vehicle of your whining pathetics to your father and mother, has not had the expected effect.</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, that your behaviour has not been mi&s;repre&s;ented: Nor need it. Your mamma, who is &s;ollicitous to take all opportunities of putting the favourable&s;t con&s;tructions upon all you do, has been forced, as you well know, to give you up, upon full proof: No need then of the expedient of pur&s;uing your Needleworks in her &s;ight. She cannot bear your whining pranks: And it is for <HI>her</HI> &s;ake, that you are not permitted to come into her pre&s;ence; nor will be, but upon her own terms.</P>
<P>You had like to have made a &s;impleton of your aunt Hervey ye&s;terday: She came down from you, pleading in your favour: But when &s;he was a&s;ked,
<PB N="32" REF="33">
What conce&s;&s;ion &s;he had brought you to? &s;he look'd about her, and knew not what to an&s;wer. So your mamma, when &s;urpri&s;ed into the beginning of your cunning addre&s;s to her and to your papa, under my name (for I had begun to read it, little &s;u&s;pecting &s;uch an <HI>ingenious</HI> &s;ubterfuge) and would then make me read it thro', wrung her hands, Oh! her dear child, her dear child, mu&s;t not be &s;o compelled!&mdash;But when &s;he was a&s;ked, Whether &s;he would be willing to have for her Son-in-law, the man who bids defiance to her whole family; and who had like to have mur|der'd her &s;on? And what conce&s;&s;ions &s;he had gain'd from her beloved, to occa&s;ion this tenderne&s;s? And that for one who had apparently deceived her, in a&s;|&s;uring her that her heart was free? then could &s;he look about her, as her &s;i&s;ter had done before: Then was &s;he again brought to her&s;elf, and to a re&s;olution to a&s;&s;ert her authority; not to <HI>transfer</HI> it, witty pre|&s;umer! over the rebel who of late, has &s;o ingrate|fully &s;truggled to throw it off.</P>
<P>You &s;eem, child, to have a high notion of the matrimonial duty; and I'll warrant, like the re&s;t of your &s;ex (one or two, whom I have the honour to know, excepted) that you will go to church to promi&s;e what you will never think of afterwards. But, <HI>&s;weet</HI> child! as your <HI>worthy</HI> mamma Norton calls you, think a little le&s;s of the <HI>matrimonial</HI> (at lea&s;t, till you come into that &s;tate) and a little more of the <HI>filial,</HI> duty.</P>
<P>How can you &s;ay, you are to bear <HI>all the mi&s;ery,</HI> when you give &s;o large a &s;hare of it to your parents, to your uncles, to your aunt, to my&s;elf, and to your &s;i&s;ter; who all, for Eighteen years of your life, loved you &s;o well?</P>
<P>If of late I have not given you room to hope for my favour or compa&s;&s;ion, it is becau&s;e of late you have not de&s;erved either. I know what you mean, little reflecting fool, by &s;aying, it is much in my
<PB N="33" REF="34">
power, altho' <HI>but</HI> your brother (a very &s;light degree of relation with you) to give you that peace, which you can give your&s;elf whenever you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The liberty of <HI>refu&s;ing,</HI> pretty Mi&s;s, is deny'd you, becau&s;e we are all &s;en&s;ible, that the liberty of <HI>choo&s;ing,</HI> to every one's di&s;like, mu&s;t follow. The vile wretch you have &s;et your heart upon, &s;peaks This plainly to every-body, tho' you won't. He &s;ays you are <HI>His,</HI> and <HI>&s;hall</HI> be <HI>His,</HI> and he will be the death of any man who robs him of his PROPERTY. So, Mi&s;s, we have a mind to try this point with him. My father &s;uppo&s;ing he has the right of a father in his child, is ab&s;olutely determin'd not to be bully'd out of that right. And what mu&s;t that child be, who prefers the Rake to a Father?</P>
<P>This is the light in which this whole debate ought to be taken. Blu&s;h, then, Delicacy! that cannot bear the Poet's <HI>Amor omnibus idem!</HI>&mdash;Blu&s;h then, Purity! Be a&s;hamed, Virgin mode&s;ty! And if capable of conviction, &s;urrender your whole will to the will of the honoured pair, to whom you owe your being: And beg of all your friends to forgive and forget the part you have of late acted.</P>
<P>I have written a longer letter, than ever I de&s;igned to write to you, after the in&s;olent treatment and pro|hibition you have given me: And now I am com|mi&s;&s;ion'd to tell you, that your friends are as weary of confining you, as you are of being confin'd. And therefore you mu&s;t prepare your&s;elf to go in a very few days, as you have been told before, to your uncle Antony's; who, notwith&s;tanding your appre|hen&s;ions, will draw up his bridge when he plea&s;es, will &s;ee what company he plea&s;es in his own hou&s;e; nor will he demoli&s;h his chapel to cure you of your fooli&s;h late-commenc'd antipathy, to a place of Divine Wor&s;hip.&mdash;The more fooli&s;h, as, if we intended to u&s;e force, we could have the ceremony pa&s;s in your chamber as well as any where el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">Prejudice again&s;t Mr. Solmes has evidently blinded you, and there is a <HI>charitable</HI> nece&s;&s;ity to open your eyes: Since no one but you thinks the gentleman &s;o contemptible in his <HI>per&s;on</HI>; nor, for a plain country gentleman, who has too much &s;olid &s;en&s;e to appear like a coxcomb, ju&s;tly blameable in his <HI>manners.</HI>&mdash;And as to his <HI>temper,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould &s;peak upon fuller knowlege, than at pre&s;ent it is plain you can have of him.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it will not be ami&s;s, that you prepare for your &s;peedy removal, as well for the &s;ake of your own conveniency, as to &s;hew your readine&s;s, in <HI>one</HI> point, at lea&s;t, to oblige your friends; one of whom you may, if you plea&s;e to de&s;erve it, reckon, tho' <HI>but</HI> a Brother,</P>

<P>I was &s;o vexed when I came to the end of this letter (the po&s;t&s;cript to which, perhaps, might be written, after the re&s;t had &s;een the letter) that I took up my pen, with an intent to write to my uncle Harlowe about re&s;uming my own e&s;tate, in pur&s;uance
<PB N="35" REF="36">
of your advice: But my heart failed me, when I re|collected, that I had not one friend to &s;tand by or &s;upport me in my claim; and that it would but the more incen&s;e them, without an&s;wering any good end. O that my cou&s;in were but come!</P>
<P>Is it not a &s;ad thing, beloved as I thought my&s;elf, &s;o lately, by every one, that now I have not one per&s;on in the world to plead for me, to &s;tand by me, or who would afford me refuge, were I to be under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking for it?&mdash;I, who had the vanity to think I had as many friends as I &s;aw faces, and flatter'd my&s;elf too, that it was not altogether un|merited, becau&s;e I &s;aw not my Maker's Image, ei|ther in man, woman, or child, high or low, rich or poor, whom, comparatively, I loved not as my&s;elf.&mdash;Would to heaven, my dear, that you were marry'd! Perhaps, then, you could have induc'd Mr. Hick|man, upon my application, to afford me protection, till the&s;e &s;torms were over-blown. But then this might have involv'd <HI>him</HI> in difficulties and dangers; and that I would not have had done for the world.</P>
<P>I don't know what to do, not I!&mdash;God forgive me, but I am very impatient!&mdash;I wi&s;h&mdash;but I don't know what to wi&s;h, without a &s;in!&mdash;Yet I wi&s;h it would plea&s;e God to take me to his mercy!&mdash;I can meet with none here!&mdash;What a world is this! What is there in it de&s;ireable? The good we hope for, &s;o &s;trangely mix'd, that one knows not what to wi&s;h for: And one half of mankind tormenting the other, and being tormented them&s;elves in tormenting!&mdash;For here in this my particular ca&s;e, my relations cannot be happy, tho' they make me unhappy!&mdash;Except my brother and &s;i&s;ter, indeed&mdash;and they &s;eem to take delight in, and enjoy, the mi&s;chief they make!</P>

<P>MRS. Betty tells me, there is now nothing talked of but of my going to my uncle Antony's. She has been order'd, &s;he &s;ays, to get ready to attend me thither. And, upon my expre&s;&s;ing my aver&s;e|ne&s;s to go, had the confidence to &s;ay, That having heard me often prai&s;e the <HI>romantic-ne&s;s</HI> of the place, &s;he was <HI>a&s;toni&s;h'd</HI> (her hands and eyes lifted up) that I &s;hould &s;et my&s;elf again&s;t going to a hou&s;e &s;o much in <HI>my ta&s;te.</HI></P>
<P>I a&s;ked, if this was her own in&s;olence, or her young mi&s;tre&s;s's ob&s;ervation?</P>
<P>She half-a&s;toni&s;h'd me by her an&s;wer; That it was hard &s;he could not &s;ay a <HI>good</HI> thing, without being robbed of the merit of it.</P>
<P>As the wench looked as if &s;he really thought &s;he had &s;aid a good thing, without knowing the boldne&s;s of it, I let it pa&s;s. But, to &s;ay the truth, this crea|ture has &s;urpri&s;ed me on many occa&s;ions with her &s;martne&s;s: For, &s;ince &s;he has been imploy'd in this controuling office, I have di&s;cover'd a great deal of wit in her a&s;&s;urance, which I never &s;u&s;pected before. This &s;hews, that in&s;olence is her talent; and that For|tune, in placing her as a &s;ervant to my &s;i&s;ter, has not done &s;o kindly by her as Nature; for that &s;he would make a better figure as her <HI>companion.</HI> And, indeed, I can't help thinking &s;ometimes, that I my&s;elf was better fitted by <HI>Nature</HI> to be the &s;ervant of <HI>both,</HI> than the <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s</HI> of the <HI>one,</HI> or the <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> of the <HI>other.</HI> And within the&s;e few months pa&s;t, <HI>Fortune</HI> has acted by me, as if &s;he were of the &s;ame mind.</P>

<P>Going down to my Poultry-yard, ju&s;t now, I heard my brother and &s;i&s;ter, and that Solmes laughing and triumphing together. The high Yew Hedge between us, which divides the yard from the garden, hinder'd them from &s;eeing me.</P>
<P>My brother, as I found, had been reading part, or the whole perhaps, of the copy of his la&s;t letter&mdash;Mighty prudent and con&s;i&s;tent, you'll &s;ay, with their views, to make me the wife of a man, from whom they conceal not, what, were I to be &s;uch, it would be kind in them to endeavour to conceal, out of re|gard to my future peace: But I have no doubt, that they hate me heartily.</P>
<P>Indeed you was up with her there, brother, &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter! You need not have bid her not write to you. I'll engage, with all her wit, &s;he'll never pre|tend to an&s;wer it.</P>
<P>Why, indeed, &s;aid my brother, with an air of College-&s;ufficiency, with which he abounds, (for he thinks nobody writes like him&s;elf) I believe I have given her a <HI>choak-pear.</HI> What &s;ay you, Mr. Solmes?</P>
<P>Why, Sir, &s;aid he, I think it is unan&s;werable. But will it not exa&s;perate her more again&s;t me?</P>
<P>Never fear, Mr. Solmes, &s;aid my brother, but we'll carry our point, if &s;he do not tire <HI>you</HI> out fir&s;t. We have gone too far in this method to recede. Her cou&s;in Morden will &s;oon be here; &s;o all mu&s;t be over, before that time, or &s;he'll be made independent of us all.</P>
<P>There, Mi&s;s Howe, is the rea&s;on given for their Jehu-driving!</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes declar'd, that he was determin'd to per&s;evere while my brother gave him any hopes, and while my father &s;tood firm.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter told my brother, that he <HI>hit me charm|ingly</HI> on the rea&s;on why I ought to conver&s;e with
<PB N="38" REF="39">
Mr. Solmes. But that he &s;hould not be &s;o &s;mart up|on the <HI>&s;ex,</HI> for the faults of <HI>this perver&s;e girl.</HI></P>
<P>Some lively, and I &s;uppo&s;e, witty an&s;wer, my bro|ther return'd; for he and Mr. Solmes laugh'd out|rageou&s;ly upon it, and Bella laughing too, call'd him a naughty gentleman: But I heard no more of what they &s;aid; they walking on into the garden.</P>
<P>If you think, my dear, that what I have related, did not again fire me, you will find your&s;elf mi&s;|taken, when you read at this place the inclo&s;ed copy of my letter to my brother; &s;truck off, while the iron was red-hot.</P>
<P>No more call me meek and gentle, I be&s;eech you.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mr. <HI>JAMES HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>Friday Morning.</DATE><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF, notwith&s;tanding your prohibition, I &s;hould be &s;ilent on occa&s;ion of your la&s;t, you would perhaps conclude, that I was con&s;enting to go to my uncle Antony's, upon the condition you mention. My fa|ther mu&s;t do as he plea&s;es with his child. He may turn me out of his doors, if he thinks fit, or give <HI>you</HI> leave to do it; but, (loth as I am to &s;ay it) I &s;hould think it very hard to be carry'd by force to any-body's hou&s;e, when I have one of <HI>my own</HI> to go to.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, notwith&s;tanding your's and my &s;i&s;ter's provocations, to think of taking my e&s;tate into my own hands, without my papa's leave: But why, if I mu&s;t not &s;tay any longer here, may I not be per|mitted to go thither? I will engage to &s;ee nobody they would not have me &s;ee, if this favour be per|mitted. <HI>Favour</HI> I call it, and am ready to receive and acknowlege it as &s;uch, altho' my grandfather's will has made it matter of right.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me, in a very unbrotherly manner, in the po&s;t&s;cript to your letter, if I have not &s;ome new pro|po&s;als
<PB N="39" REF="40">
to make. I HAVE (&s;ince you put the que&s;tion) three or four:&mdash;<HI>New ones</HI> all, I think; tho' I will be &s;o bold as to &s;ay, that, &s;ubmitting the ca&s;e to any one impartial per&s;on, whom <HI>you</HI> have not &s;et again&s;t me, my <HI>old</HI> ones ought not to have been rejected. I <HI>think</HI> This, why then &s;hould I not <HI>write</HI> it?&mdash;Nor have you any more rea&s;on to &s;torm at your <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> for telling it you (&s;ince you &s;eem, in your letter, to make it your boa&s;t how you turned my mamma and my aunt Hervey again&s;t me) than I have to be angry with my <HI>brother,</HI> for treating me as no brother ought to treat a &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>The&s;e are my new propo&s;als then:</P>
<P>That, as above, I may not be hinder'd from going to re&s;ide (under &s;uch conditions as &s;hall be pre&s;cribed to me, which I will mo&s;t religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve) at my grandfather's late hou&s;e. I will not again in this place call it <HI>mine.</HI> I have rea&s;on to think it a great mi&s;|fortune, that ever it was &s;o! <HI>Indeed</HI> I have!</P>
<P>If this be not permitted, I de&s;ire leave to go for a month, or for what time &s;hall be thought fit, to Mi&s;s Howe's. I dare &s;ay her mamma will con&s;ent to it, if I have my papa's permi&s;&s;ion to go.</P>
<P>If this, neither, be allowed, and I <HI>am</HI> to be turned out of my father's hou&s;e, I beg I may be &s;uffer'd to go to my aunt Hervey's, where I will inviolably ob|&s;erve her commands, and tho&s;e of my papa and mamma.</P>
<P>But if this, neither, is to be granted, it is my humble reque&s;t, that I may be &s;ent to my uncle Har|lowe's, in&s;tead of my uncle Antony's. I mean not by this any di&s;re&s;pect to my uncle Antony: But his Moat, with his Bridge threaten'd to be drawn up, and perhaps his Chapel, terrify me beyond expre&s;&s;ion, not|with&s;tanding your <HI>witty</HI> ridicule upon me for that ap|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>If this likewi&s;e be refu&s;ed, and I mu&s;t be carried to the Moated hou&s;e, which u&s;ed to be a delightful one
<PB N="40" REF="41">
to me, let it be promi&s;ed me, that I &s;hall not be com|pelled to receive Mr. Solmes's vi&s;its there; and then I will as chearfully go, as ever I did.</P>
<P>So here, Sir, are my new propo&s;als. And if none of them an&s;wer your end, as each of them tends to the exclu&s;ion of that ungenerous per&s;i&s;ter's vi&s;its, be plea&s;ed to know, that there is no misfortune I will not &s;ubmit to, rather than yield to give my hand to the man, to whom I can allow no &s;hare in my heart.</P>
<P>If I write in a &s;tyle different from my u&s;ual, and different from what I wi&s;hed to have occa&s;ion to write, an impartial per&s;on, who knew what I have acci|dentally, within this hour pa&s;t, heard from your mouth, and my &s;i&s;ter's, and a third per&s;on's (particu|larly the rea&s;on you give for driving on at this violent rate; to wit, my cou&s;in Morden's &s;oon-expected ar|rival), would think, I have but too much rea&s;on for it. Then be plea&s;ed to remember, Sir, that when my <HI>whining vocatives</HI> have &s;ubjected me to &s;o much &s;corn and ridicule, it is time, were it but to <HI>imitate</HI> exam|ples &s;o excellent as <HI>you</HI> and my <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI> &s;et me, that I &s;hould endeavour to a&s;&s;ert my character, in order to be thought le&s;s an <HI>alien,</HI> and <HI>nearer of kin to you both,</HI> than either of you have of late &s;eemed to &s;uppo&s;e me.</P>
<P>Give me leave, in order to <HI>empty my female quiver</HI> at once, to add, that I know no other rea&s;on you can have, for forbidding me to reply to you, after you have written what you plea&s;ed to me, than that you are con&s;cious you cannot an&s;wer to rea&s;on and to ju&s;tice the treatment you give me.</P>
<P>If it be otherwi&s;e, I, an un-learned, un-logical girl, younger by near a third than your&s;elf, will venture (&s;o a&s;&s;ured am I of the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e) to put my fate upon an i&s;&s;ue with <HI>you:</HI> With <HI>you,</HI> Sir, who have had the advantage of an academical education; who&s;e mind mu&s;t have been &s;trengthen'd by ob&s;er|vation, and learned conver&s;ation; and who, pardon
<PB N="41" REF="42">
my going &s;o <HI>low</HI>&punc; have been accu&s;tomed to give <HI>choak-pears</HI> to tho&s;e you vouch&s;afe to write again&s;t.</P>
<P>Any impartial per&s;on, your late Tutor, for in&s;tance; or the pious and worthy Dr. Lewin, may be judge be|tween us: And if either give it again&s;t me, I will pro|mi&s;e to re&s;ign to my de&s;tiny: Provided, if it be given again&s;t you, that my father will be plea&s;ed only to allow of my negative to the per&s;on &s;o violently &s;ought to be impo&s;ed upon me.</P>
<P>I flatter my&s;elf, Brother, that you will the readier come into this propo&s;al, as you &s;eem to have a high opinion of your talents for argumentation; and not a <HI>low</HI> one of the cogency of the arguments contained in your la&s;t letter. And as I can po&s;&s;ibly have no ad|vantage in a contention with you, if the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e affords me not any, (as you have no opinion it will) it behoves you, methinks, to &s;hew to an im|partial moderator, that <HI>I</HI> am wrong, and <HI>you</HI> not &s;o.</P>
<P>If this be accepted, there is a nece&s;&s;ity for its being carry'd on by the pen; the facts to be &s;tated, and agreed upon by both; and the deci&s;ion to be given, according to the force of the arguments each &s;hall produce in &s;upport of their &s;ide of the que&s;tion: For, give me leave to &s;ay, I know too well the <HI>manline&s;s</HI> of your temper, to offer at a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> debate with you.</P>
<P>If it be not accepted, I &s;hall conclude, that you cannot defend your conduct towards me: And &s;hall only beg of you, that, for the future, you will treat me with the re&s;pect due to a &s;i&s;ter from a brother, who would be thought as polite as learned.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, if I have &s;eem'd to &s;hew &s;ome &s;pirit, not quite foreign to the relation I have the honour to bear to <HI>you,</HI> and to my <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI>; and which may be deem'd not altogether of a piece with that part of my cha|racter which once, it &s;eems, gained me every one's love; be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider to <HI>whom,</HI> and to <HI>what</HI> it is owing; and that this part of that character was not di&s;pen&s;ed with, till it &s;ubjected me to that &s;corn
<PB N="42" REF="43">
and tho&s;e in&s;ults, which a brother, who has been <HI>&s;o tenacious of an independence,</HI> that I <HI>voluntarily</HI> gave up, and who has appeared <HI>&s;o exalted</HI> upon it, ought not to have &s;hewn to <HI>any-body,</HI> much le&s;s to a <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>defencele&s;s</HI> &s;i&s;ter: Who is, notwith&s;tanding, an affectionate and re&s;pectful one, and would be glad to &s;hew her&s;elf to be &s;o upon all future occa&s;ions; as &s;he has in every action of her pa&s;t life, altho' of late &s;he has met with &s;uch unkind returns.</P>

<P>MY Si&s;ter is but this moment gone from me: She came up, all in a flame, which obliged me abruptly to lay down my pen: She run to me&mdash;</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday Midnight.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have now a calmer moment. Envy, Ambition, high and &s;elfi&s;h Re&s;entment, and all the violent Pa&s;&s;ions, are now, mo&s;t probably, a&s;leep all around me; and &s;hall not my own angry ones give way to the &s;ilent hour, and &s;ub&s;ide likewi&s;e?&mdash;They <HI>have</HI> given way to it; and I have made u&s;e of the gentler &s;pace to re-peru&s;e your la&s;t letters. I will touch up|on &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in them: And that I may the le&s;s endanger the but ju&s;t-recovered calm, I will begin with what you write about Mr. Hickman.</P>
<P>Give me leave to &s;ay, That I am &s;orry you can|not yet per&s;uade your&s;elf to think better, that is to &s;ay, <HI>more ju&s;tly,</HI> of that gentleman, than your whim|&s;ical picture of him &s;hews you do; or, at lea&s;t, than the humorou&s;ne&s;s of your natural vein would make one <HI>think</HI> you do.</P>
<P>I do not imagine, that you your&s;elf will &s;ay, he &s;at for the picture you have drawn. And yet, upon the whole, it is not greatly to his di&s;advantage. Were I at ea&s;e in my mind, I would venture to draw a much more amiable and ju&s;t likene&s;s.</P>
<P>If Mr. Hickman has not that a&s;&s;urance which &s;ome men have, he has that humanity and gentlene&s;s, which many want: And which, with the infinite value he has for you, will make him one of the propere&s;t hu&s;bands in the world for a per&s;on of your vivacity and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Altho' you &s;ay I would not like him my&s;elf, I do a&s;&s;ure you, if Mr. Solmes were &s;uch a man as Mr. Hickman, in per&s;on, mind, and behaviour, my friends and I had never di&s;agreed about him, if they would not have permitted me to live &s;ingle; Mr. Lovelace
<PB N="52" REF="54">
(having &s;uch a character as he has) would have &s;tood no chance with me. This I can the more boldly aver, becau&s;e, I plainly perceive, that of the two pa&s;&s;ions, <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> This man will be able to in&s;pire one with a much greater proportion of the <HI>latter,</HI> than I imagine is compatible with the <HI>former,</HI> to make a happy marriage.</P>
<P>I am glad you own, that you like no one better than Mr. Hickman. In a little while, I make no doubt, you will be able, if you challenge your heart upon it, to acknowlege, that you like not any man &s;o well: E&s;pecially, when you come to con&s;ider, that the very faults you find in Mr. Hickman, admirably fit him to make <HI>you</HI> happy: That is to &s;ay, If it be nece&s;&s;ary to your happine&s;s, that you &s;hould have your own will in every thing.</P>
<P>But let me add one thing: And that is this:&mdash;You have &s;uch a &s;prightly turn, that, with your admirable talents, you would make any man in the world, who loved you, look like a fool, except he were &s;uch a one as Lovelace.</P>
<P>Forgive me, my dear, for my frankne&s;s: And for|give me al&s;o, for &s;o &s;oon returning to &s;ubjects &s;o im|mediately relative to my&s;elf, as tho&s;e I now mu&s;t touch upon.</P>
<P>You again in&s;i&s;t, &s;trengthen'd by Mr. Lovelace's opinion, upon my a&s;&s;uming my own e&s;tate: And I have given you room to expect, that I will con&s;ider this &s;ubject more clo&s;ely than I had done before.&mdash;I mu&s;t however own, that the rea&s;ons that I had to offer again&s;t your advice, were &s;o obvious, that I thought you would have &s;een them your&s;elf, and been determin'd by them, again&s;t your own ha&s;tier coun&s;el.&mdash;But &s;ince this has not been &s;o; and that both you and Mr. Lovelace call upon me to a&s;&s;ume my own e&s;tate, I will enter briefly into the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, let me a&s;k you, my dear, &s;up|po&s;ing I were inclined to follow your advice, Whom
<PB N="53" REF="55">
have I to &s;upport me in my demand?&mdash;My uncle Harlowe is one of my tru&s;tees. He is again&s;t me. My cou&s;in Morden is the other. He is in Italy, and may be &s;et again&s;t me too. My brother has declar'd, that they are re&s;olved to carry their point before he arrives: So that, as they drive on, all will probably be decided before I could have an an&s;wer from him, were I to write: And, confined as I am, if the an&s;wer were to come in time, and they did not like it, they would keep it from me.</P>
<P>In the next place, parents have great advantages in every eye over the child, if &s;he di&s;pute their plea|&s;ure in the di&s;po&s;ing of her: And &s;o they ought: Since out of twenty in&s;tances, perhaps two could not be produced, where <HI>they</HI> were not in the right, the <HI>child</HI> in the wrong.</P>
<P>You would not, I am &s;ure, have me accept of Mr. Lovelace's offer'd a&s;&s;i&s;tance in &s;uch a claim. If I would embrace any <HI>other</HI> per&s;on's, who el&s;e would care to appear for a child again&s;t parents, ever, till of late, &s;o affectionate? But were &s;uch a protector to be found, what a length of time would it take up in a cour&s;e of litigation?&mdash;The Will and the Deeds have flaws in them, they &s;ay: My brother &s;ometimes talks of going to re&s;ide at <HI>The Grove:</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e with a de&s;ign to make ejectments nece&s;&s;ary, were I to offer at a&s;&s;uming; or &s;hould I marry Lovelace, in order to give him all the oppo&s;ition and difficulty the Law would help him to give.</P>
<P>The&s;e ca&s;es I have put to my&s;elf, for argument-&s;ake: But they are all out of the que&s;tion, altho' any-body <HI>were</HI> to be found who would e&s;pou&s;e my cau&s;e: For, I do a&s;&s;ure you, I would &s;ooner beg my bread, than litigate for my right with my papa: Since I am convinc'd, that whether or not the parent do his duty by the child, the child cannot be exempted from do|ing hers to him. And to go to law with my <HI>Father,</HI> what a &s;ound has That? You will &s;ee, that I have
<PB N="54" REF="56">
mention'd my wi&s;h (as an alternative, and as a favour) to be permitted, if I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be put out of his hou&s;e, to go thither: But not one &s;tep further can I go. And you &s;ee how This is re&s;ented.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, what have I to hope for, but a change in my father's re&s;olution? And is there any probability of that; &s;uch an a&s;cendency as my brother and &s;i&s;ter have obtained over every-body; and &s;uch an intere&s;t to pur&s;ue the enmity they have now openly avow'd again&s;t me?</P>
<P>As to Mr. Lovelace's approbation of your a&s;|&s;umption-&s;cheme, I wonder not at it. He, very probably, penetrates the difficulties I &s;hould have to bring it to effect, without his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Were I to find my&s;elf as free as I would wi&s;h my&s;elf to be, per|haps that man would &s;tand a wor&s;e chance with me, than his vanity may permit him to imagine; not|with&s;tanding the plea&s;ure you take in raillying me on his account. How know you, but all that appears to be &s;pecious and rea&s;onable in his offers&mdash;Such as, &s;tanding his chance for my favour, after I became in|dependent, as I may call it (by which, I mean no more, than having the liberty to refu&s;e a man in that Solmes, whom it hurts me but to think of as a hu&s;band); and &s;uch as his not vi&s;iting me but by my leave; and till Mr. Morden came; and till I were &s;atisfy'd of his reformation;&mdash;How know you, I &s;ay, that he gives not him&s;elf the&s;e airs purely to &s;tand better in <HI>your</HI> graces as well as <HI>mine,</HI> by offering, of his own accord, conditions which he mu&s;t needs think would be in&s;i&s;ted on, were the ca&s;e to happen?</P>
<P>Then am I utterly di&s;plea&s;ed with him. To threaten as he threatens&mdash;Yet to pretend, that it is not to in|timidate me; and to beg of you not to tell me, when he mu&s;t know you <HI>would,</HI> and no doubt mu&s;t <HI>intend</HI> that you <HI>&s;hould,</HI> is &s;o meanly artful!&mdash;The man mu&s;t think he has a frighted fool to deal with.&mdash;I, to join hands with &s;uch a man of violence!&mdash;My own bro|ther
<PB N="55" REF="57">
the man he threatens!&mdash;And Mr. Solmes!&mdash;What has Mr. Solmes done to him?&mdash;Is <HI>he</HI> to be blamed, if he thinks a per&s;on would make a wife worth having, to endeavour to obtain her?&mdash;Oh! that my friends would but leave me to my own way in this one point!&mdash;For have I given the man encourage|ment &s;ufficient to ground the&s;e threats upon? Were Mr. Solmes a man to whom I could be but indifferent, it might be found, that to have the merit of a &s;ufferer given him, from &s;uch a flaming &s;pirit, would very little an&s;wer the views of that flaming &s;pirit.&mdash;It is my fortune to be treated as a fool by my brother: But Mr. Lovelace &s;hall find&mdash;Yet I will let <HI>him</HI> know my mind; and then it will come with a better grace to your knowlege.</P>
<P>Mean time, give me leave to tell you, that it goes again&s;t me, in my cooler moments, wicked as my brother is to me, to have you, my dear, who are <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> as it were, write &s;uch very &s;evere reflections upon him, in relation to the advantage Lovelace had over him. He is not indeed <HI>your</HI> brother: But you write to <HI>his</HI> &s;i&s;ter, remember!&mdash;Upon my word, Mi&s;s, you dip your pen in gall, whenever you are offended: And I am almo&s;t ready to que&s;tion, when I read &s;ome of your expre&s;&s;ions, again&s;t others of my relations as well as him (altho' in my favour), whether you are &s;o thoroughly warranted, by <HI>your own</HI> pa|tience, as you think your&s;elf, to call <HI>other</HI> people to account for <HI>their</HI> warmth. Should we not be par|ticularly careful to keep clear of the faults we cen|&s;ure?&mdash;And yet I am &s;o angry at both my brother and &s;i&s;ter, that I &s;hould not have taken this liberty with my dear friend, notwith&s;tanding I know you <HI>never</HI> loved them, had you not made &s;o light of &s;o &s;hocking a tran&s;action, where a brother's life was at &s;take: Where his credit in the eye of the mi&s;|chievous &s;ex, has received a &s;till deeper wound, than he <HI>per&s;onally</HI> &s;u&s;tained; and when a revival of the

<P>His credit, I &s;ay, in the eye of the <HI>mi&s;chievous Sex:</HI> Who is not warranted to call it &s;o; when it is reckon'd among the men, &s;uch an extraordinary piece of &s;elf-conque&s;t, as the two libertines his companions gloried, to re&s;olve never to <HI>give</HI> a challenge; and among whom duelling is &s;o fa&s;hionable a part of brutal bra|very, that the man of temper, who is, mo&s;tly, I be|lieve, the truly brave man, is often at a great lo&s;s how to behave in &s;ome ca&s;es, to avoid incurring ei|ther a mortal guilt, or a general contempt.</P>
<P>To inlarge a little upon this &s;ubject, may we not infer, That tho&s;e who would be guilty of throwing the&s;e contempts upon a man of temper, for avoiding a greater evil, know not the mea&s;ure of true mag|nanimity: Nor how much nobler it is to <HI>forgive,</HI> and even how much more <HI>manly</HI> to <HI>de&s;pi&s;e,</HI> than to <HI>re&s;ent.</HI> Were I a man, methinks, I &s;hould have too much &s;corn for a per&s;on, who could wilfully do me a mean injury, to put a value upon his life, equal to what I put upon my own.

<P>How willingly would I run away from my&s;elf, and what mo&s;t concerns my&s;elf, if I could!

I renew therefore my former earne&s;tne&s;s, as the new day ap|proaches, and will bring with it perhaps new tryals, that you will (as undive&s;tedly as po&s;&s;ible of favour or re&s;entment) tell me what you would have me do:&mdash;For if I am obliged to go to my uncle Antony's,

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. March 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHAT <HI>can</HI> I advi&s;e you, my noble creature? Your merit is your crime. You can no more change <HI>your</HI> nature, than your per&s;ecutors can <HI>theirs.</HI> Your di&s;tre&s;s is owing to the va&s;t di&s;parity between you and them. What would you have of them? Do they not act in character?&mdash;And to whom? To an Alien. You are not one of them.&mdash;They have two dependencies&mdash;Upon their own <HI>impenetrablene&s;s,</HI> one (I'd give it a properer name, if I dared); the other, on the regard you have always had for your <HI>character</HI> (Have they not heretofore own'd as much?) and upon your apprehen&s;ions from <HI>that</HI> of Lovelace, which would di&s;credit you, &s;hould you take any &s;tep by his means to extricate your&s;elf. Then they know, that re&s;entment and unper&s;uadablene&s;s are not natural to you; and that the anger they have wrought you up to, will &s;ub&s;ide, as all <HI>extraordinaries</HI> &s;oon do; and that once marry'd, you'll make the be&s;t of it.</P>
<P>But &s;urely your <HI>father</HI>'s elde&s;t &s;on and elde&s;t daugh|ter have a view to intail unhappine&s;s for life upon you, were you to have the man who is already more near|ly related to them, than ever he can be to you, &s;hould the &s;hocking compul&s;ion take place; by commu|nicating to &s;o narrow a &s;oul all they know of your ju&s;t aver&s;ion to him.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="60">As to that wretch's per&s;everance, tho&s;e only, who know not the man, will wonder at it. He has not the lea&s;t delicacy. When-<HI>ever</HI> he &s;hall marry, his view will not be for mind. How &s;hould it? He has <HI>not</HI> a mind: And does not <HI>Like &s;eek its Like?</HI>&mdash;And if it finds &s;omething beyond it&s;elf, how &s;hall that be valued, which cannot be comprehended? Were you to be his, and &s;hew a vi&s;ible want of tenderne&s;s to him; it is my opinion, he would not be much con|cerned at it; &s;ince that would leave him the more at liberty to pur&s;ue tho&s;e &s;ordid attachments which are predominant in him. I have heard you well ob&s;erve, from your Mrs. Norton, That a per&s;on who has any <HI>over-ruling</HI> pa&s;&s;ion, will compound by giving up twenty <HI>&s;econdary</HI> or <HI>under</HI>-&s;atisfactions, tho' more laud|able ones, in order to have <HI>that</HI> gratify'd.</P>
<P>I'll give you the &s;ub&s;tance of a conver&s;ation (no fear you can be made to like him wor&s;e than you do already) that pa&s;&s;ed between Sir Harry Downeton and this Solmes, but three days ago, as Sir Harry told it but ye&s;terday to my mamma and me. It will con|firm to you that what your &s;i&s;ter's in&s;olent Betty re|ported he &s;hould &s;ay, of governing by fear, was not of her own head.</P>
<P>Sir Harry told him, he wonder'd he &s;hould hope to carry you &s;o much again&s;t your inclination, as every-body knew it would be, if he did.</P>
<P>He matter'd not That, he &s;aid: Coy maids made fond wives (A &s;orry fellow!) It would not at all grieve him to &s;ee a pretty woman make wry faces, if &s;he gave him cau&s;e to vex her. And your e&s;tate, by the convenience of its &s;ituation, would richly pay him, for all he could bear with your &s;hyne&s;s.</P>
<P>He &s;hould be &s;ure, after a while, of your com|plai&s;ance, at lea&s;t, if not of your love: And in That &s;hould be happier than nine parts in ten of his marry'd acquaintance.</P>
<P>What a wretch is this!</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61">For the re&s;t, your known virtue would be as great a &s;ecurity to him, as he could wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>She will look upon you, &s;aid Sir Harry (who is a reader), if &s;he be forced to marry you, as Elizabeth of France did upon Philip II. of Spain, when he received her on his frontiers, as her hu&s;band, who <HI>was</HI> to have been but her father-in-law: That is, with fear and terror, rather than with complai&s;ance and love: And you will, perhaps, be as &s;urly to her, as That old Monarch was to <HI>his</HI> bride.</P>
<P>Terror and Fear, the wretch, the horrid wretch, &s;aid, looked pretty in a bride, as well as in a wife: And, laughing (yes, my dear, the hideous fellow laughed immoderately, as Sir Harry told us, when he &s;aid it), It &s;hould be his care, to perpetuate the oc|ca&s;ion for that <HI>fear,</HI> if he could not think he had the <HI>love.</HI> And, for his part, he was of opinion, that if LOVE and FEAR mu&s;t be &s;eparated in matrimony, the man who made him&s;elf <HI>feared,</HI> fared be&s;t!</P>
<P>If my eyes would carry with them the execution which the eyes of the Ba&s;ili&s;k are &s;aid to do, I would make it my fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ee this creature.</P>
<P>My mamma, however, &s;ays, it would be a pro|digious merit in you, if you could get over your aver|&s;ion to him. Where, a&s;ks &s;he, as you have been a&s;k'd before, is the prai&s;e-worthine&s;s of obedience, if it be only paid in in&s;tances where we give up no|thing?</P>
<P>What a fatality, that you have no better an op|tion!&mdash;Either a <HI>Scylla</HI> or a <HI>Charybdis!</HI></P>
<P>Were it not YOU, I &s;hould know how (barbarou&s;ly u&s;ed, as you are u&s;ed) to advi&s;e you in a moment. But &s;uch a noble character to &s;uffer from a (&s;uppo&s;ed) ra&s;hne&s;s and indi&s;cretion of &s;uch a nature, would be a wound to the Sex, as I have heretofore ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>While I was in hope, that the a&s;&s;erting of your own independence would have helped you, I was plea&s;ed, that you had <HI>one</HI> re&s;ource, as I thought: But
<PB N="60" REF="62">
now, that you have &s;o well proved, that &s;uch a &s;tep would not avail you, I am intirely at a lo&s;s what to &s;ay. I will lay down my pen, and think.</P>
<P>I HAVE con&s;idered, and con&s;idered again; but, I prote&s;t, I know no more what to &s;ay, than before. Only this: That I am young, like your&s;elf; and have a much weaker judgment, and &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions, than you have.</P>
<P>I have heretofore &s;aid, that you have offer'd as much as you ought to offer in living &s;ingle. If you Were never to marry, the e&s;tate they are &s;o loth &s;hould go out of their name, would, in time, I &s;up|po&s;e, revert to your brother: And <HI>he</HI> or <HI>his</HI> would have it, perhaps, much more certainly this way, than by the precarious rever&s;ions Solmes makes them hope for. Have you put this into their odd heads, my dear?&mdash;The tyrant word AUTHORITY, as they u&s;e it, can be the only objection again&s;t this offer.</P>
<P>One thing you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that, if you leave your parents, your duty and love to them will not &s;uffer you to appeal again&s;t them, to ju&s;tify your&s;elf for &s;o doing; and &s;o you'll have the world again&s;t you. And &s;hould Lovelace continue his wild life, and behave ungratefully to you, how will That ju&s;tify their conduct to <HI>you</HI> (which nothing <HI>el&s;e</HI> can), as well as their re&s;entments again&s;t <HI>him?</HI></P>
<P>May heaven direct you for the be&s;t! I can only &s;ay, that, for my own part, I would do any-thing, go any-whither, rather than be compelled to marry the man I hate; and, were he &s;uch a man as <HI>Solmes,</HI> mu&s;t always hate. Nor could I have borne, what you have borne, if from father and uncles, not from brother and &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>My mamma will have it, that after they have try'd their utmo&s;t efforts to bring you into their mea&s;ures, and find them ineffectual, they will recede. But I
<PB N="61" REF="63">
cannot &s;ay I am of her mind. She does not own, &s;he has any other authority for this, but her own con|jecture. I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have hoped, that your uncle Antony and &s;he had been in one &s;ecret, and that favourable to you:&mdash;Woe be to one of them at lea&s;t (your uncle I mean), if they &s;hould be in <HI>any other!</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible, avoid being carried to that uncle's. The man, the par&s;on, the chapel, your brother and &s;i&s;ter pre&s;ent!&mdash;they'll certainly there marry you to Solmes. Nor will your newly-rai&s;ed &s;pirit &s;upport you in your re&s;i&s;tance on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion. Your meekne&s;s will return; and you will have nothing for it but tears (tears de&s;pi&s;ed by them all), and ineffectual appeals and lamentations:&mdash;And <HI>the&s;e,</HI> when the ceremony is <HI>profaned,</HI> as I may &s;ay, you mu&s;t &s;uddenly put a &s;top to, and dry up: And endeavour to di&s;po&s;e your&s;elf to &s;uch an humble frame of mind, as may induce your new-made Lord to for|give all your pa&s;t declarations of aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my dear, you mu&s;t then blandi&s;h him over with a confe&s;&s;ion, that all your pa&s;t behaviour was maidenly re&s;erve only: And it will be <HI>your</HI> part to convince him of the truth of his impudent &s;arca&s;m, <HI>That the coye&s;t maids make the fonde&s;t wives.</HI> Thus will you begin the &s;tate with a high &s;en&s;e of obli|gation to his <HI>forgiving goodne&s;s!</HI> And if you will not be kept to it by that <HI>fear</HI> he propo&s;es to govern by, I am much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Yet, after all, I mu&s;t leave the point undetermin'd, and only to <HI>be</HI> determin'd, as you find they recede from their avowed purpo&s;e, or re&s;olve to remove you to your uncle Antony's. But I mu&s;t repeat my wi&s;hes, that &s;omething may fall out, that <HI>neither</HI> of the&s;e men may call you <HI>his!</HI> And may you live &s;ingle, my deare&s;t friend, till &s;ome man &s;hall offer, that may be as worthy of you, as man <HI>can</HI> be.</P>
<P>But yet, methinks, I would not, that you, who
<PB N="62" REF="64">
are &s;o admirably qualify'd to adorn the matrimonial &s;tate, &s;hould be always &s;ingle. You know I am in|capable of flattery; and that I always &s;peak and write the &s;incere dictates of my heart. Nor can you, from what you mu&s;t know of your own merit (taken in a comparative light with others), doubt my &s;incerity. For why &s;hould a per&s;on who delights to find out and admire every thing that is prai&s;e-worthy in <HI>an|other,</HI> be &s;uppo&s;ed ignorant of like perfections in <HI>her|&s;elf,</HI> when &s;he could not &s;o much admire them <HI>in</HI> another, if &s;he had them <HI>not</HI> her&s;elf? And why may not one give <HI>her</HI> tho&s;e prai&s;es, which <HI>&s;he</HI> would give to any other, who had but half of her own excel|lencies?&mdash;E&s;pecially when &s;he is incapable of pride and vainglory; and neither de&s;pi&s;es others for the want of her fine qualities, nor over-values her&s;elf up|on them?&mdash;<HI>Over</HI>-values, did I &s;ay!&mdash;How can that be?&mdash;</P>
<P>Forgive me, my beloved friend. My admiration of you (increa&s;ed, as it is, by every letter you write) will not always be held down in &s;ilence; altho' in order to avoid offending you, I generally endeavour to keep it from flowing to my pen, when I write to you, or to my lips, whenever I have the happine&s;s to be in your company.</P>

<P>HOW &s;oothing a thing is prai&s;e from tho&s;e we love!&mdash;Whether con&s;cious or not, of de&s;erving it, it cannot but give us great delight, to &s;ee one's &s;elf &s;tand high in the opinion of tho&s;e who&s;e favour we are ambitious to cultivate. An ingenuous mind will make this farther u&s;e of it, that if it be &s;en&s;ible, that it does not <HI>already</HI> de&s;erve the charming attributes, it will ha&s;ten, before its friend finds her&s;elf mi&s;taken, to obtain the graces it is complimented for: And this it will do, as well in honour to it&s;elf, as to pre|&s;erve its friend's opinion, and ju&s;tify her judgment!&mdash;May This be always my aim!&mdash;And then you will not only give the <HI>prai&s;e,</HI> but the <HI>merit</HI>; and I &s;hall be more worthy of that friend&s;hip, which is the only plea&s;ure I have to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t heartily I thank you for the kind di&s;patch of your la&s;t favour. How much am I indebted to you! and even to your hone&s;t &s;ervant!&mdash;Under what ob|ligations does my unhappy &s;ituation lay me!</P>
<P>But let me an&s;wer the kind contents of it, as well as I may.</P>
<P>As to getting over my di&s;gu&s;ts to Mr. Solmes, it is impo&s;&s;ible to be done; while he wants Genero&s;ity, Frankne&s;s of Heart, Benevolence, Manners, and every qualification that di&s;tingui&s;hes a worthy man. O my dear! what a degree of patience, what a great|ne&s;s of &s;oul, is required in the wife, not to de&s;pi&s;e a hu&s;band who is more ignorant, more illiterate, more low-minded, than her&s;elf?&mdash;The wretch, ve&s;ted
<PB N="64" REF="66">
with prerogatives, who will claim rule in virtue of them (and not to <HI>permit</HI> who&s;e claim, will be as di&s;|graceful to the <HI>pre&s;cribing</HI> wife, as to the <HI>govern'd</HI> hu&s;band); How &s;hall &s;uch a hu&s;band as This be borne, were he, for rea&s;ons of <HI>convenience</HI> and <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> even to be one's CHOICE? But, to be <HI>compelled</HI> to have &s;uch a one, and that compul&s;ion to ari&s;e from motives as unworthy of the <HI>pre&s;cribers</HI> as of the <HI>pre&s;cribed,</HI> who can think of getting over an aver&s;ion &s;o ju&s;tly founded? How much ea&s;ier to bear the <HI>temporary</HI> per&s;ecutions I labour under, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> temporary, than to re&s;olve to be <HI>&s;uch</HI> a man's for <HI>life?</HI> Were I to comply, mu&s;t I not leave my relations, and go to him? <HI>One month</HI> will decide the one perhaps: But what a <HI>duration of woe</HI> will the other be!&mdash;Every day, it is likely, ri&s;ing to witne&s;s to &s;ome new breach of an Altar-vow'd duty!</P>
<P>Then, my dear, the man &s;eems already to be me|ditating vengeance upon me for an aver&s;ion I cannot help: For ye&s;terday, my &s;aucy gaolere&s;s a&s;&s;ured me, That all my oppo&s;itions would not &s;ignify that <HI>pinch of &s;nuff,</HI> holding out her genteel finger and thumb: That I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have Mr. Solmes: That there|fore, I had not be&s;t carry my je&s;t too far; for that Mr. Solmes was a man of &s;pirit, and had told HER, that as I &s;hould &s;urely be his, I acted very unpoliticly; &s;ince, if he had not more <HI>mercy</HI> (that was <HI>her</HI> word; I know not if it were <HI>his</HI>) than I had, I might have cau&s;e to repent the u&s;age I gave him, to the la&s;t day of my life.</P>
<P>But enough of this man; who, by what you re|peat from Sir Harry Downeton, has all the in&s;olence of his Sex, without any one quality to make that in|&s;olence tolerable.</P>
<P>I have received two letters from Mr. Lovelace, &s;ince his vi&s;it to you; which made three that I had not an&s;wer'd. I doubted not his being very unea&s;y; but in his la&s;t he complains in high terms of my &s;ilence; not in the &s;till &s;mall voice, or rather &s;tyle, of
<PB N="65" REF="67">
an humble Lover, but in a &s;tyle like that, which would probably be u&s;ed by a &s;lighted Protector. And his pride is again touched, that like a <HI>thief</HI> or <HI>eves|dropper,</HI> he is forced to dodge about in hopes of a letter, and return five miles, and then to an incon|venient lodging, without any.</P>
<P>His letters, and the copy of mine to him, &s;hall &s;oon attend you: Till when, I will give you the &s;ub|&s;tance of what I wrote to him ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>I take him &s;everely to ta&s;k, for his freedom in threatening me, thro' you, with a vi&s;it to Mr. Solmes, or to my brother. I &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That, &s;urely, I mu&s;t be thought to be a creature fit to bear <HI>any-thing:</HI> That violence and menaces from &s;ome of my <HI>own family</HI> are not enough for me to bear, in order to make me avoid <HI>him</HI>; but that I mu&s;t have them from <HI>him</HI> too, upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that I will oblige tho&s;e, whom it is both my <HI>inclination</HI> and <HI>duty</HI> to oblige in every-thing that is rea&s;onable, and in my power.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Very extraordinary, I tell him, that a violent &s;pirit &s;hall threaten to do a ra&s;h and unju&s;tifiable thing, which concerns <HI>me</HI> but little, and him&s;elf a great deal, if I do not &s;omething <HI>as</HI> ra&s;h, my character and &s;ex con&s;ider'd, to divert him from it.'</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I even hint, that, however it may affect me, if any mi&s;chief &s;hall be done on my account, yet there are per&s;ons, as far as I know, who, in my ca&s;e, would not think there would be rea&s;on for <HI>much</HI> regret, were &s;uch a committed ra&s;hne&s;s as he threat|ens Mr. Solmes with, to rid her of <HI>two</HI> per&s;ons, whom had &s;he never known, &s;he had never been unhappy.'</Q></P>
<P>This is plain-dealing, my dear! And I &s;uppo&s;e he will put it into &s;till plainer Engli&s;h for me.</P>
<P>I take his pride to ta&s;k, on his di&s;daining to watch for my letters; and for his <HI>eves-dropping</HI> language: And &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That, &s;urely, he has the le&s;s rea&s;on to think &s;o hardly of his &s;ituation, &s;ince his faulty mo|rals
<PB N="66" REF="68">
are the original cau&s;e of all; and &s;ince faulty morals de&s;ervedly level all di&s;tinction, and bring down rank and birth to the <HI>Canaille</HI>; and to the nece&s;&s;ity, of which he complains, of appearing, if I mu&s;t de&s;cend to his language, as an <HI>eves-dropper</HI> and a <HI>thief.</HI> And then I &s;orbid him ever to expect another letter from me, that is to &s;ubject him to &s;uch di&s;graceful hard&s;hips.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That as to the &s;olemn vows and prote&s;tations, he is &s;o ready, upon all occa&s;ions, to make, they have the le&s;s weight with me, as they give a kind of de|mon&s;tration, that he him&s;elf thinks, from his own character, there is <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to make them. <HI>Deeds</HI> are to me the only evidences of <HI>intentions.</HI> And I am more and more convinced of the nece&s;&s;ity of break|ing-off a corre&s;pondence with a per&s;on, who&s;e ad|dre&s;&s;es I &s;ee it is impo&s;&s;ible either to expect my friends to encourage, or him to de&s;erve that they &s;hould.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'What therefore I repeatedly de&s;ire is, That &s;ince his birth, alliances, and expectations, are &s;uch, as will at any-time, if his immoral character be not an objection, procure him, at lea&s;t, equal advantages, in a woman who&s;e ta&s;te and inclinations, moreover, might be better adapted to his own; I in&s;i&s;t upon it, as well as advi&s;e it, that he give up all thoughts of me: And the rather, as he has all along, by his threatening and unpolite behaviour to my friends, and whenever he &s;peaks of them, given me rea&s;on to conclude, that there is more malice to <HI>them,</HI> than regard to <HI>me,</HI> in his per&s;everance.'</Q></P>
<P>This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the letter I have written to him.</P>
<P>The man, to be &s;ure, mu&s;t have the penetration to ob&s;erve, that my corre&s;pondence with him hitherto is owing more to the &s;everity I meet with, than to a very high value for him. And &s;o I would have him think. What a <HI>wor&s;e</HI> than Moloch-deity is That,
<PB N="67" REF="69">
which expects an offering of rea&s;on, duty, and di&s;|cretion, to be made to its &s;hrine!</P>
<P>Your mamma is of opinion, that <HI>at la&s;t</HI> my friends will relent. Heaven grant that they may!&mdash;But my brother and &s;i&s;ter have &s;uch an influence over every-body, and are &s;o determin'd; &s;o pique them&s;elves upon &s;ubduing me, and carrying their point; that I de&s;pair that they will:&mdash;And yet, if they do not, I frankly own, I would not &s;cruple to throw my&s;elf upon any not di&s;reputable protection, by which I might avoid my pre&s;ent per&s;ecutions, on one hand, and not give Lovelace advantage over me, on the other.&mdash;That is to &s;ay, were there manife&s;tly <HI>no other</HI> way left me: For, if there <HI>were,</HI> I &s;hould think the leaving my father's hou&s;e, without his con&s;ent, one of the mo&s;t inexcu&s;able actions I could be guilty of, were the protection to be ever &s;o unexceptionable; and This notwith&s;tanding the independent fortune willed me by my grandfather. And indeed I have often reflected with a degree of indignation and di&s;|dain, upon the thought of what a low, &s;elfi&s;h crea|ture that child mu&s;t be, who is to be rein'd-in only by what a parent can or will do for her.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding all this, I owe it to the &s;in|cerity of friend&s;hip to confe&s;s, that I know not what I <HI>&s;hould</HI> have done, had your advice been conclu&s;ive any way. Had you, my dear, been witne&s;s to my different emotions, as I read your letter, when, in one place, you advi&s;e me of my danger, if I am car|ry'd to my uncle's; in another, when you own you could not bear what I bear, and would do any thing rather than marry the man you hate: yet, in an|other, repre&s;ent to me my reputation &s;uffering in the world's eye; and the nece&s;&s;ity I &s;hould be under to ju&s;tify my conduct, at the expence of my friends, were I to take a ra&s;h &s;tep: in another, in&s;inuate the <HI>di&s;hone&s;t</HI> figure I &s;hould be forced to make, in &s;o com|pell'd a matrimony; endeavouring to cajole, fawn
<PB N="68" REF="70">
upon, and play the hypocrite with a man I have an aver&s;ion to; who would have rea&s;on to believe me an hypocrite, as well from my former avowals, as from the &s;en&s;e he <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have (if common &s;en&s;e he has) of his own demerits:&mdash;The nece&s;&s;ity you think there would be for me, the more aver&s;e I really was, to &s;eem the fonder of him: A fondne&s;s, were I capable of &s;o much di&s;&s;imulation, that would be imputable to the mo&s;t di&s;graceful motives; as it would be too vi&s;i|ble, that love, either of per&s;on or mind, could be neither of them:&mdash;Then his undoubted, his even con&s;titutional narrowne&s;s: His too probable jealou&s;y, and unforgivingne&s;s, bearing in mind my declared aver&s;ion, and the unfeigned de&s;pights I took all oppor|tunities to do him, in order to di&s;courage his addre&s;s: A preference avow'd again&s;t him from the <HI>&s;ame</HI> mo|tive: with the pride he profe&s;&s;es to take in curbing, and &s;inking the &s;pirits of a woman he had acquired a right to tyrannize over:&mdash;Had you, I &s;ay, been wit|ne&s;s of my different emotions as I read; now leaning This way; now That; now perplexed; now appre|hen&s;ive; now angry at one, then at another; now re|&s;olving; now doubting,&mdash;you would have &s;een the power you have over me; and would have had rea&s;on to believe, that, had you given your advice in any de|termin'd or po&s;itive manner, I had been ready to have been concluded by it. So, my dear, you will find, from the&s;e acknowlegements, that you mu&s;t ju&s;tify me to tho&s;e Laws of Friend&s;hip, which require undi&s;gui&s;ed frankne&s;s of heart; altho' your ju&s;tification of me in that particular, will perhaps be at the expence of my prudence.</P>
<P>But, upon the whole, This I do repeat&mdash;That no|thing but the <HI>la&s;t</HI> extremity &s;hall make me abandon my father's hou&s;e, if they will permit me to &s;tay; and if I can, by any means, by any hone&s;t pretences, but keep off my evil de&s;tiny in it, till my cou&s;in Morden arrives. As one of my tru&s;tees, <HI>his</HI> is a protection
<PB N="69" REF="71">
that I may, without di&s;credit, throw my&s;elf into, if my other friends &s;hould remain determin'd. And This (altho' they &s;eem too well aware of it) is all my hope: For, as to Lovelace, were one to be &s;ure of his tenderne&s;s to one's-&s;elf, and even of his reforma|tion, mu&s;t not the thoughts of embracing the offer'd protection of his family, be the &s;ame in the world's eye, as accepting of his own?&mdash;Could I avoid re|ceiving his vi&s;its at his own relations? Mu&s;t I not be his, whatever, on &s;eeing him in a <HI>nearer</HI> light, I &s;hould find him out to be.

<P>Then you tell me, in your u&s;ual, kindly-partial manner, what is expected of <HI>me,</HI> more than would be of &s;ome others. This &s;hould be a le&s;&s;on to me.

<P>I hear nothing but what this confident creature, Betty, throws out in the wantonne&s;s of office. Now it is, Why, Mi&s;s, don't you look up your things?

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Mar. 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Follow my la&s;t of this date, by command. I men|tioned in my former, my mamma's opinion of the merit you would have, if you could oblige your friends, again&s;t your own inclination. Our conference upon this &s;ubject was introduced by the conver&s;ation we had had with Sir Harry Downeton; and my mamma thinks it of &s;o much importance, that &s;he injoins me to give you the particulars of it. I the rather com|ply, as I was unable in my la&s;t to tell what to advi&s;e you to; and as you will in this recital have my mam|ma's opinion, at lea&s;t; and, perhaps, in <HI>hers,</HI> what the <HI>world</HI>'s would be, were it to know only what &s;he knows; and not &s;o much as I know.</P>
<P>My mamma argues upon this ca&s;e in a mo&s;t di&s;|couraging manner, for all &s;uch of our &s;ex as look for|ward for happine&s;s in marriage with the <HI>man of their choice.</HI></P>
<P>Only, that I know, &s;he has a &s;ide-view to her daughter; who, at the &s;ame time that &s;he now pre|fers no one to another, values not the man her mam|ma mo&s;t regards, of one farthing; or I &s;hould lay it more to heart.</P>
<P>What is there in it, &s;ays &s;he, that all this bu&s;tle is about? Is it &s;uch a mighty matter for a young Lady to give up her own inclinations to oblige her friends?</P>
<P>Very well, my mamma, thought I! NOW, may you a&s;k this&mdash;At FORTY, you may&mdash;But what would you have &s;aid at EIGHTEEN, is the que&s;tion!</P>
<P>Either, &s;aid &s;he, the Lady mu&s;t be thought to have very violent inclinations (and what nice young crea|ture would have That &s;uppo&s;ed?) which &s;he <HI>could</HI> not give up; or a very &s;tubborn will, which &s;he
<PB N="72" REF="74">
<HI>would</HI> not; or, thirdly, have parents &s;he was indif|ferent about obliging.</P>
<P>You know my mamma now and then argues very notably: always very warmly at lea&s;t. I happen of|ten to differ from her; and we both think &s;o well of our own arguments, that we very &s;eldom are &s;o happy as to convince one another. A pretty com|mon ca&s;e, I believe, in all <HI>vehement</HI> debatings. She &s;ays, I am <HI>too witty</HI>; Anglic&egrave;, <HI>too pert:</HI> I, That &s;he is <HI>too wi&s;e</HI>; that is to &s;ay, being likewi&s;e put into Eng|li&s;h, <HI>Not &s;o young as &s;he has been:</HI> In &s;hort, is grown &s;o much into <HI>mother,</HI> that &s;he has forgotten &s;he ever was a <HI>daughter.</HI> So, generally, we call another cau&s;e by con&s;ent&mdash;Yet fall into the old one half a dozen times over, <HI>without</HI> con&s;ent:&mdash;Quitting and Re&s;ume|ing, with half-angry faces, forced into a &s;mile, that there might be &s;ome room to piece together again: But go to bed, if bed-time, a little &s;ullen, neverthe|le&s;s; or, if we &s;peak, her &s;ilence is broke, with an Ah! Nancy! You are &s;o lively! &s;o quick! I wi&s;h you were le&s;s like your papa, child!&mdash;</P>
<P>I pay it off with thinking, that my mamma has no rea&s;on to di&s;claim her &s;hare in her Nancy: And if the matter go off with greater &s;everity on her &s;ide than I wi&s;h for, then her favourite Hickman fares the wor&s;e for it, next day.</P>
<P>I know I am a &s;aucy creature: I know, if I do not <HI>&s;ay</HI> &s;o, you will <HI>think</HI> &s;o; &s;o no more of This, ju&s;t now. What I mention it for, is to tell you, that on this &s;erious occa&s;ion, I will omit, if I can, all that pa&s;&s;ed between us, that had an air of flippancy on my part, or quickne&s;s on my mamma's, to let you into the <HI>cool</HI> and the <HI>cogent,</HI> of the conver&s;ation.</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The lovers <HI>imaginaries</HI> [Her own word!

<P>I told my mamma, that if <HI>you</HI> were to take any ra&s;h &s;tep, it would be owing to the indi&s;creet violence of your friends: I was afraid, I &s;aid, that the&s;e reflections upon the conduct of people in the married &s;tate, who might &s;et out with better hopes, were but too well-grounded: But that this mu&s;t be allowed me, that if children weighed not the&s;e matters &s;o thoroughly as they ought, neither did parents make tho&s;e allow|ances for youth, inclination, and inexperience, which were nece&s;&s;ary to be made for them&s;elves at their childrens time of life.</P>
<P>I remember'd a letter, I told her hereupon, which you wrote a few months ago, per&s;onating an anony|mous elderly Lady (in Mr. Wyerley's day of plaguing you) to Mi&s;s Drayton's mamma, who, by her se|verity and re&s;traints, had like to have driven the young Lady into the very fault, again&s;t which her mother was mo&s;t &s;ollicitous to guard her. And, I dared to &s;ay, &s;he would be plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>I fetched the copy of it, which you had favoured me with at the time; I would have read only that par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of it, which was mo&s;t to my purpo&s;e: But &s;he would hear it all <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P>The pa&s;&s;age mo&s;t particularly recommended by Mi&s;s Howe, the following.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Permit me, Madam (&s;ays the per&s;onated grave writer) to ob&s;erve&punc; That if per&s;ons of your experience would have young people look <HI>for+ward,</HI> in order to be wi&s;er and better by their advice, it would be kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in them to look <HI>backward,</HI> and allow for their childrens youth, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> natural vivacity; in other words, for their lively hopes, unabated by time, unaccompanied by reflection, and unchecked by di&s;appointment.

For, Madam, the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t generous minds, when har&s;hly treated, become generally the mo&s;t inflexible. If the young Lady knows her <HI>heart</HI> to be right, however defective her <HI>head</HI> may be, for want of years and experience, &s;he will be apt to be very tenacious. And if &s;he believes her friends to be wrong, altho' perhaps they may be only &s;o in their methods of treating her, how much will every <HI>unkind</HI> cir|cum&s;tance on the parent's part, or <HI>heedle&s;s</HI> one on the child's, though ever &s;o &s;light in it&s;elf, widen the difference?

<P><PB N="75" REF="77">My mamma was plea&s;ed with the whole letter; and &s;aid, It de&s;erved to have the effect it had. But a&s;ked me, what excu&s;e could be offer'd for a young Lady capable of making &s;uch reflections; and who, at her time of life, could &s;o well a&s;&s;ume the character of one of riper years; if &s;he &s;hould ru&s;h into any fatal mi&s;|take her&s;elf?</P>
<P>She then touched upon the moral character of Mr. Lovelace; and how rea&s;onable the aver&s;ion of your relations is, to a man, who gives him&s;elf the li|berties he is &s;aid to take; and who, indeed, him&s;elf, denies not the accu&s;ation; having been heard to de|clare, that he will do all the mi&s;chief he can to the Sex, in revenge for the ill u&s;age and broken vows of his fir&s;t love, at a time when he was <HI>too young</HI> (his own expre&s;&s;ion, it &s;eems) to be in&s;incere.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="78">I reply'd, That I had heard every one &s;ay, that that Lady really u&s;ed him ill; that it affected him &s;o much at the time, that he was forced to travel upon it; and, to drive her out of his heart, ran into cour&s;es, which he had ingenuity enough him&s;elf to condemn: That, however, he had denied the menaces again&s;t the Sex, which were attributed to him, when charged with them by me in your pre&s;ence; and declared him&s;elf incapable of &s;o unju&s;t and ungenerous a re&s;ent|ment again&s;t <HI>all,</HI> for the perfidy of <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P>You remember this, my dear; as I do your in|nocent ob&s;ervation upon it, That you could believe his &s;olemn a&s;&s;everation and denial:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'For, &s;urely, &s;aid you, the man who would re&s;ent, as the highe&s;t indignity, that could be offer'd to a gentleman, the imputation, of a <HI>wilful</HI> fal&s;hood, would not be guilty of one.'</Q></P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;ted upon the extraordinary circum&s;tances in your ca&s;e, particularizing them: Ob&s;erving, that Mr. Lovelace's morals were, at one time, no ob|jection with your relations for Mi&s;s Arabella: That then much was built upon his family, and more upon his parts and learning, which made it out of doubt, that he might be reclaim'd by a woman of virtue and prudence: And [Pray forgive me for mentioning it] I ventured to add, that altho' your family might be good &s;ort of folks, as the world went, yet no-body imputed to any of them, but your&s;elf, a very pun|ctilious concern for religion or piety&mdash;Therefore were they the le&s;s intitled to object to the defects of that kind in others. Then, what an odious man, &s;aid I, have they picked out, to &s;upplant, in a Lady's af|fections, one of the fine&s;t appearances of a man in England, and one noted for his brilliant parts, and other accompli&s;hments (whatever his morals might be); as if they were determined upon an act of power and authority, without rhyme or rea&s;on!</P>
<P>Still my mamma in&s;i&s;ted, that there was the greater
<PB N="77" REF="79">
merit in your obedience on that account, and urged, that there hardly ever was a very hand&s;ome and a &s;prightly man who made a good hu&s;band: For that they were generally &s;uch Narci&s;&s;us's, as to imagine every woman ought to think as highly of them, as they did of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There was no danger from that con&s;ideration <HI>here,</HI> I &s;aid, becau&s;e the Lady had &s;till greater advantages, both of per&s;on and mind, than the Man; graceful and elegant, as he mu&s;t be allowed to be, beyond any of his &s;ex.</P>
<P>She cannot endure to hear me prai&s;e any man but her favourite Hickman: Upon whom, neverthele&s;s, &s;he generally brings a degree of contempt, which he would e&s;cape, did &s;he not le&s;&s;en the little merit he has, by giving him on all occa&s;ions, more than I think he can de&s;erve, and entering him into com|pari&s;ons, in which it is impo&s;&s;ible but he mu&s;t be a &s;ufferer. And now, prepo&s;terous partiality!

<P>To avoid entering further into &s;uch an <HI>incomparable</HI> compari&s;on, I &s;aid I did not believe, had they left you to your own way, and treated you generou&s;ly, that you would have had the thought of encouraging any man, whom they di&s;liked.</P>
<P>Then, Nancy, catching me up, the excu&s;e is le&s;s&mdash;For, if &s;o, mu&s;t there not be more of <HI>contra|diction,</HI> than <HI>love,</HI> in the ca&s;e?</P>
<P>Not &s;o, neither, Madam: For I know Mi&s;s Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe would prefer Mr. Lovelace to all men, if morals&mdash;</P>
<P>If, Nancy!&mdash;That <HI>If</HI> is every-thing!&mdash;Do you really think &s;he loves Mr. Lovelace?</P>

All that can be &s;aid, in extenuation of a daughter's error, ari&s;es from a kind con&s;ideration, which Mi&s;s's letter to Lady Drayton pleads for, to be paid to <HI>her</HI> daughter's youth and inexperience.

<P>Let her know, Nancy, out of hand, what I &s;ay; and I charge you to repre&s;ent farther to her, That let her di&s;like one man, and approve another, ever &s;o|much, it will be expected of a young Lady of her unbounded genero&s;ity, and greatne&s;s of mind, that &s;he &s;hould <HI>deny her&s;elf,</HI> when &s;he can <HI>oblige all her family</HI> by &s;o doing: No le&s;s than ten or a dozen, perhaps, the neare&s;t and deare&s;t to her of all the per&s;ons in the

<P>I &s;aid a great deal upon this <HI>judgment</HI>-&s;ubject: All that you could wi&s;h I &s;hould &s;ay; and all that your extraordinary ca&s;e allowed me to &s;ay.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday Afternoon.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am in great apprehen&s;ions. Yet cannot help re|peating my humble thanks to your mamma, and you, for your la&s;t favour. I hope her kind end is an&s;wer'd by the contents of my la&s;t. Yet I mu&s;t not think it enough to acknowlege her goodne&s;s to me, with a pencil only, on the cover of a letter &s;ealed up. A few lines give me leave to write with
<PB N="80" REF="82">
regard to my anonymous letter to Lady Drayton&mdash;If I did not at that time tell you, as I believe I did, that my excellent Mrs. Norton gave me her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in that letter; I now acknowlege that &s;he did.</P>
<P>Pray let your mamma know this, for two rea&s;ons: One, that I may not be thought to arrogate to my|&s;elf a di&s;cretion which does not belong to me; the other, that I may not &s;uffer by the &s;evere, but ju&s;t inference &s;he was plea&s;ed to draw; <HI>doubling</HI> my faults upon me, if I my&s;elf &s;hould act unworthy of the ad|vice I was &s;uppo&s;ed to give.</P>
<P>Before I come to what mo&s;t nearly affects me, I mu&s;t chide you, once more, for the &s;evere, the very &s;evere things, you mention of our family, to the di&s;paragement of their morals, as I may &s;ay: Indeed, my dear, I wonder at you!&mdash;A &s;lighter oc|ca&s;ion might have pa&s;&s;ed me, after I have written to you &s;o often to &s;o little purpo&s;e, on this topic. But, affecting as my own circum&s;tances are, I cannot, without a breach of duty, let &s;lip the reflection I need not repeat in words.</P>
<P>There is not a worthier per&s;on in England than my mamma. Nor is my papa that man you &s;ome|times make him. Excepting in one point, I know not any family which lives up more to their duty, than the principals of ours. A little too <HI>uncom|municative</HI> for their great circum&s;tances&mdash;that is all.&mdash;Why, then, have they not rea&s;on to in&s;i&s;t up|on unexceptionable morals in a man who&s;e relation|&s;hip to them, by a marriage in their family, they have certainly a right to allow of, or di&s;approve?</P>
<P>Another line or two, before I am ingro&s;s'd by my own concerns:&mdash;Upon your treatment of Mr. Hick|man.&mdash;Is it, do you think, generous, to revenge upon an innocent per&s;on, the di&s;plea&s;ure you receive from another quarter, where I doubt you are a tre&s;|pa&s;&s;er too?&mdash;But one thing I can tell him; and you had not be&s;t provoke me to it; That no woman u&s;es
<PB N="81" REF="83">
a man ill whom &s;he does not ab&s;olutely reject, but &s;he has it in her heart to make him amends, when her tyranny has had its run, and he has completed the mea&s;ure of his &s;ervices and patience. But my mind is not enough at ea&s;e, to pu&s;h this matter further.</P>
<P>I will now give you the occa&s;ion of my pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>I had rea&s;on to fear, as I mention'd in mine of this morning, that a &s;torm was brewing. Mr. Solmes came home this afternoon, from church, with my brother. Soon after, Betty brought me up a letter, without &s;aying from whom. It was in a cover, and directed by a hand I never &s;aw before; as if it was &s;uppo&s;ed, I would not have received and open'd it, had I known it came from him. The&s;e are the contents.</P>

There is no &s;tanding again&s;t your looks and language. It is the &s;trength of our love makes us decline to &s;ee you. How <HI>can</HI> we, when you are re&s;olved not to <HI>do,</HI> what we are re&s;olved you <HI>&s;hall</HI> do? I never, for my part, loved any creature, as I loved you from your youth till now. And indeed, as I have often &s;aid, Never was there a young creature &s;o de&s;erving of our love. But what is come to you now!&mdash;Alas! alas, my dear! How you fail in the trial!</P>
<P>I have read the letters you inclo&s;ed. At a proper time, I may &s;hew them to my brother and &s;i&s;ter. But they will receive nothing from you at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>For my part, I could not read your letter to my&s;elf, without being unmann'd. How can you be &s;o unmov'd your&s;elf, yet be &s;o able to move every-body el&s;e? How could you &s;end &s;uch a letter to Mr. Solmes? Fie upon you!&mdash;How &s;trangely are you alter'd?</P>

If you <HI>were</HI> en|vied, why &s;hould you &s;harpen envy, and file up its teeth to an edge?&mdash;You &s;ee I write like an impartial man, and as one that loves you &s;till!</P>
<P>But &s;ince you have di&s;play'd your talents, and &s;pared no-body, and moved every-body, without be|ing moved, you have but made us &s;tand the clo&s;er and firmer together.

<P>Re&s;olve but to oblige us all, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Clary, and you &s;hall &s;ee how we will cla&s;p you every one by turns, to our rejoicing hearts!&mdash;If the one man has not the wit, and the parts, and the per&s;on, of the other, no one breathing has a wor&s;e heart than that other: And is not the love of all your friends, and a &s;ober man (if he be not &s;o poli&s;hed), to be preferred

to a debauchee, tho' ever &s;o sine a man, to look at? You have &s;uch fine talents, that you will be adored by the one: But the other has as much advantage in tho&s;e re&s;pects, as you have your&s;elf, and will not &s;et by them one straw: For hu&s;bands are &s;ometimes jealous of their authority, with witty wives. You will have, in one, a man of virtue. Had you not been &s;o rudely affronting to him, he would have made your ears tingle, with what he could have told you of the other.</P>
<P>Come, my dear niece, let me have the honour of doing with you what no-body el&s;e yet has been able to do.

<P>He knows, he &s;ays, what a jewel that man will have, who can obtain your favour; and he will think light of all he has &s;uffer'd, or &s;hall &s;uffer, in obtain|ing you.</P>
<P>Dear, &s;weet creature, oblige us: And oblige us with a grace. It <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be done, whether with a grace or not. I do a&s;&s;ure you it <HI>mu&s;t.</HI> You mu&s;t not con|quer father, mother, uncles, every-body: Depend upon That.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear and honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOW you rejoice me by your, conde&s;cending goodne&s;s!&mdash;So kind, &s;o paternal a letter!&mdash;&s;o &s;oothing to a wounded heart; and of late what I have been &s;o little u&s;ed to!&mdash;How am I affected with it! Tell me not, dear Sir, of my way of writing: Your letter has more moved <HI>me,</HI> than I ever could move <HI>any-body!</HI>&mdash;It has made me, with all my heart, wi&s;h I could intitle my&s;elf to be vi&s;ited upon your own terms; and to be led down to my papa and mamma, by &s;o good and &s;o kind an uncle.</P>
<P>I will tell you, deare&s;t Sir, what I will do to make my peace. I have no doubt that Mr. Solmes would greatly prefer my &s;i&s;ter to &s;uch a &s;trange, aver&s;e crea|ture as me: His chief, or one of his chief motives to addre&s;s me, is, as I have rea&s;on to believe, the contiguity of my grandfather's e&s;tate to his own: I will re&s;ign it; for ever I will re&s;ign it: And the re&s;ignation mu&s;t be good, becau&s;e I will never marry at all: I will make it over to my &s;i&s;ter, and her heirs for ever. I &s;hall have no heirs, but my brother and her; and I will receive, as of my papa's bounty, &s;uch an annuity (not in lieu of the e&s;tate, but as <HI>of</HI> his bounty), as he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to grant me, if it be ever &s;o &s;mall; and whenever I di&s;oblige him, he &s;hall withdraw it, at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Will not This be accepted?&mdash;Sure it mu&s;t!&mdash;Sure
<PB N="90" REF="92">
it will!&mdash;I beg of you, deare&s;t Sir, to propo&s;e it; and &s;econd it with your intere&s;t. This will an&s;wer every end. My &s;i&s;ter has a high opinion of Mr. Solmes. I never can have <HI>any</HI> in the light he is propo&s;ed to me. But as my &s;i&s;ter's hu&s;band, he will be always intitled to my re&s;pect; and &s;hall have it.</P>
<P>If this be accepted, grant me, Sir, the honour of a vi&s;it; and do me then the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure of leading me down to the feet of my honoured pa|rents, and they &s;hall find me the mo&s;t dutiful of chil|dren; and to the arms of my brother and &s;i&s;ter, and they &s;hall find me the mo&s;t obliging and mo&s;t affec|tionate of &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>I wait, Sir, for your an&s;wer to this propo&s;al, made with the whole heart of</P>

<P>I HOPE this will be accepted: For Betty tells me, that my uncle Antony and my aunt Hervey are &s;ent for; and not Mr. Solmes, which I look upon as a fa|vourable circum&s;tance. With what chearfulne&s;s will I a&s;&s;ign over this envied e&s;tate!&mdash;What a much more valuable con&s;ideration &s;hall I part with it for!&mdash;The love and favour of all my relations!&mdash;That love and favour, which I u&s;ed for eighteen years together to rejoice in, and be di&s;tingui&s;hed by!&mdash;And what a charming pretence will this afford me of breaking with Mr. Lovelace! And how ea&s;y will it po&s;&s;ibly make him, to part with <HI>me!</HI></P>
<P>I found this morning, in the u&s;ual place, a letter from him, in an&s;wer, I &s;uppo&s;e, to mine of Friday, which I depo&s;ited not till Saturday. But I have not opened it; nor will I, till I &s;ee what effect this new offer will have.</P>
<P>Let me but be permitted to avoid the man I hate; and I will give up, with all my heart, the man I
<PB N="91" REF="93">
could prefer. To renounce the one, were I really to value him, as you &s;eem to imagine, can give but a temporary concern, which time and di&s;cretion will make light: This is a &s;acrifice which a child owes to parents and friends, if they in&s;i&s;t upon its being made. But the other, to marry a man one <HI>cannot endure,</HI> is not only a di&s;hone&s;t thing, as to the man; but it is enough to make a creature, who wi&s;hes to be a good wife, a bad or indifferent one, as I once wrote to the man him&s;elf: And then &s;he can hardly be either a good mi&s;tre&s;s; a good friend; or any thing but a di&s;credit to her family, and a bad example to all around her.</P>
<P>Methinks I am loth, in the <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;e</HI> I am in at pre&s;ent, to depo&s;ite this, becau&s;e I &s;hall then leave you in as <HI>great:</HI> But having been prevented by Betty's officiou&s;ne&s;s twice, I will now go down to my little poultry; and if I have an opportunity, will leave it in the u&s;ual place, where I hope to find &s;omething from you.</P>

<P>I HAVE depo&s;ited my narrative down to this day noon; but I hope &s;oon to follow it with another letter, that I may keep you as little a while as po&s;&s;ible in that &s;u&s;pen&s;e, which I am &s;o much affected by at this moment: For my heart is di&s;turbed at every foot I hear &s;tir; and every door below, that I hear open or &s;hut.</P>
<P>They have been all a&s;&s;embled &s;ome time, and are in clo&s;e debate, I believe: But can there be room for long debate upon a propo&s;al, which, if accepted, will &s;o effectually an&s;wer all their views?&mdash;Can they in&s;i&s;t a moment longer upon my having Mr. Solmes,

To the&s;e, no doubt, one, or both, it mu&s;t be owing, that my propo&s;al admits of &s;o much con&s;ideration. I want, methinks, to &s;ee, what Lovelace, in his letter, &s;ays. But I will deny my&s;elf <HI>this</HI> piece of curio&s;ity, till that which is rai&s;ed by my pre&s;ent &s;u&s;pen&s;e is an&s;wered.&mdash;Ex|cu&s;e me, my dear, that I thus trouble you with my uncertainties.

<P>WOULD you believe it?&mdash;Betty, by anticipation, tells me, that I am to be refu&s;ed. I am
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'a vile, art|ful creature. Every-body is too good to me. My uncle Harlowe has been <HI>taken-in,</HI> that's the phra&s;e. They knew how it would be, if he either wrote to me, or &s;aw me. He has, however, been made a&s;hamed to be &s;o wrought upon.&mdash;A pretty thing, truly, in the eye of the world, were they to take me at my word. It would look as if they had treated me thus hardly, as <HI>I</HI> think it, for this very purpo&s;e. My peculiars, particularly Mi&s;s Howe, would give it that turn; and I my&s;elf could mean nothing by it, but to &s;ee if it would be accepted, in order to &s;trengthen my own arguments again&s;t Mr. Solmes. It was amazing, that it could admit of a moment's deliberation: That any thing could be <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to be done in it. It was equally again&s;t Law and Equity: And a fine &s;ecurity Mi&s;s Bella

would have, or Mr. Solmes, when I could re&s;ume it when I would!&mdash;My <HI>brother</HI> and <HI>&s;he</HI> my heirs! O the artful creature!&mdash;<HI>I</HI> to re&s;olve to live &s;ingle, when Lovelace was &s;o <HI>&s;ure</HI> of me!&mdash;and every|where declared as much!&mdash;and could, whenever he plea&s;ed, if my hu&s;band, claim under the Will!&mdash;Then the in&s;olence&mdash;the confidence&mdash;(as Betty mincingly told me, that one &s;aid; you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s who) that &s;he, who was &s;o ju&s;tly in di&s;grace for downright rebellion, &s;hould pretend to pre&s;cribe to the whole family!&mdash;&s;hould name a husband for her elder &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;What a triumph would her ob&s;ti|nacy go away with, to delegate her commands, not as from a pri&s;on, as &s;he called it, but as from her throne, to her elders and betters; and to her father and mother too!&mdash;Amazing, perfectly amazing! that any-body could argue upon &s;uch a plan as this! It was a ma&s;ter-&s;troke of fine&s;&s;e!&mdash;It was ME in perfection!&mdash;Surely my uncle Harlowe will never be &s;o taken-in again!'</Q></P>
<P>All this was the readier told me, becau&s;e it was again&s;t me, and would teaze and vex me. But as &s;ome of this fine recapitulation implied, that &s;ome|body &s;poke up for me, I was curious to know who it was: But Betty would not tell me, for fear I &s;hould have the con&s;olation to find, that <HI>all</HI> were not again&s;t me.</P>
<P>But do you not &s;ee, my dear, what a &s;ad creature &s;he is whom you honour with your friend&s;hip!&mdash;You could not doubt your influence over me: Why did you not let me know my&s;elf a little better?&mdash;Why did you not take the friendly liberty I have always taken with you, and tell me my faults, and what a &s;pecious hy|pocrite I am? For if my brother and &s;i&s;ter could make &s;uch di&s;coveries, how is it po&s;&s;ible, that faults &s;o enormous [You could &s;ee <HI>others,</HI> you thought, of a <HI>more &s;ecret</HI> nature!] could e&s;cape your penetrating eye?</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96">Well, but now, it &s;eems, they are debating how and by whom to an&s;wer me: For they know not, nor <HI>are</HI> they to know, that Mrs. Betty has told me all the&s;e fine things. One de&s;ires to be excu&s;ed, it &s;eems: Another choo&s;es not to have any thing to &s;ay to me: Another has enough of me: And of writing to &s;o ready a &s;cribbler, there will be no end.</P>
<P>Thus are tho&s;e imputed qualifications, which u&s;ed &s;o lately to gain me applau&s;e, now become my crimes; &s;o much do di&s;gu&s;t and anger alter the property of things.</P>
<P>What will be the re&s;ult of their debate, I &s;uppo&s;e, will, &s;ome-how or other, be communicated to me by-and-by. But let me tell you, my dear, that I am made &s;o de&s;perate, that I am afraid to open Mr. Love|lace's letter, le&s;t, in the humour I am in, I &s;hould do &s;omething, if I find it not exceptionable, that may give me repentance as long as I live!</P>

<OPENER><DATE>Monday night.</DATE><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Find I am a very &s;ad creature, and did not know it. I wrote not to my Brother. To <HI>you,</HI> Sir, I wrote. From <HI>you</HI> I hope the honour of an an&s;wer. No one reveres her uncles more than I do. Never|thele&s;s, I will be bold to &s;ay, that the di&s;tance, great as it is, between uncle and niece, excludes not &s;uch a hope: And I think I have not made a propo&s;al that de&s;erves to be treated with &s;corn.</P>
<P>Forgive me, Sir&mdash;My heart is full.&mdash;Perhaps one day you may think you have been <HI>prevailed upon</HI> (for that is plainly the ca&s;e!) to join to treat me, as I do not de&s;erve to be treated. If <HI>you</HI> are a&s;hamed, as my brother hints, of having expre&s;&s;ed any returning ten|derne&s;s to me, God help me! I &s;ee I have no mercy to expect, from any-body! But, Sir, from <HI>your</HI> pen let me have an an&s;wer; I humbly be&s;eech it of you.&mdash;Till my brother can recollect what belongs to a &s;i&s;ter, I will take no an&s;wer from <HI>him,</HI> to the letter I wrote to <HI>you,</HI> nor any commands whatever.</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> move every-body! This, Sir, is what you are plea&s;ed to mention:&mdash;But whom have I moved?&mdash;One per&s;on in the family has more moving ways than I have, or he could never &s;o unde&s;ervedly have made every-body a&s;hamed to &s;hew any tenderne&s;s to a poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed child of the &s;ame family.</P>
<P>Return me not this with contempt, or torn, or unan&s;wer'd, I be&s;eech you. My papa has a title to do that, or any-thing, by his child: But from no other per&s;on in the world, of your &s;ex, ought a young creature, of mine (while &s;he pre&s;erves a &s;upplicating &s;pirit), to be &s;o treated.</P>
<P>When what I have before written in the humble&s;t &s;train has met with &s;uch &s;trange con&s;tructions, I am afraid, that this unguarded &s;crawl will be very ill-received. But I beg, Sir, you will oblige me with
<PB N="96" REF="98">
one line, be it ever &s;o har&s;h, in an&s;wer to my pro|po&s;al. I &s;till think it ought to be attended to. I will enter into the mo&s;t &s;olemn engagements to make it valid, by a perpetual &s;ingle life. In a word, any thing I <HI>can</HI> do, I <HI>will</HI> do, to be re&s;tored to all your favours.

<P>I mu&s;t take That chance, I &s;aid: I only de&s;ired &s;he would deliver it as directed.</P>
<P>Sad doings! very &s;ad! &s;he &s;aid, that young Ladies &s;hould &s;o violently &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t their duty!</P>
<P>I told her, &s;he &s;hould have the liberty to &s;ay what &s;he plea&s;ed, &s;o &s;he would but be my me&s;&s;enger that one time&mdash;And down &s;he went with it.</P>

<P>She would not undertake for That, &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>I am now in expectation of the re&s;ult. But having &s;o little ground to hope for either favour or mercy, I opened Mr. Lovelace's letter.</P>
<P>I would &s;end it to you, my dear (as well as tho&s;e I &s;hall inclo&s;e, by this conveyance; but not being able at pre&s;ent to determine in what manner I &s;hall an&s;wer it, I will give my&s;elf the trouble of ab&s;tracting it here, while I am waiting for what may offer from the letter ju&s;t gone down.</P>

<P>I HAVE another letter from Mr. Lovelace. I open'd it, with the expectation of its being filled with bold and free complaints, on my not writing to pre|vent his two nights watching, in weather not ex|tremely agreeable. But, in&s;tead of complaints, he is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'full of tender concern le&s;t I may have been pre|vented by indi&s;po&s;ition, or by the clo&s;er confinement which he has frequently caution'd me that I may expect.'</Q></P>
<P>He &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He had been in different di&s;gui&s;es loi|tering about our garden and park wall, all the day on Sunday la&s;t; and all Sunday-night was wandering about the coppice, and near the back-door. It rain'd 
<PB N="101" REF="103">
and he has got a great cold, attended with feveri&s;h|ne&s;s, and &s;o hoar&s;e, that he has almo&s;t lo&s;t his voice.'</Q></P>
<P>Why did he not flame out in his letter?&mdash;Treated, as I am treated by my friends, it is dangerous for me to lie under the &s;en&s;e of an obligation to any one's patience, when that per&s;on &s;uffers in health for my &s;ake.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He had no &s;helter, he &s;ays, but under the great overgrown Ivy, which &s;preads wildly round the heads of two or three Oaklings; and that was &s;oon wet through.'</Q></P>
<P>You and I, my dear, once thought our&s;elves obliged to the natural &s;hade they afforded us, in a &s;ultry day.</P>
<P>I can't help &s;aying, I am &s;orry he has &s;uffer'd for my &s;ake.&mdash;But 'tis his own &s;eeking!</P>
<P>His letter is dated la&s;t night at eight:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'And in|di&s;po&s;ed as he is, he tells me, That he will watch till ten, in hopes of my giving him the meeting he &s;o earne&s;tly reque&s;ts. And after that, he has a mile to walk to his hor&s;e and &s;ervant; and four miles then to ride to his inn.'</Q></P>
<P>He owns,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That he has an intelligencer in our family; who has failed him for a day or two pa&s;t: And not knowing how I do, or how I may be treated, his anxiety is the greater.'</Q></P>
<P>This circum&s;tance gives me to gue&s;s who this trea|cherous man is: One Jo&s;eph Leman: The very crea|ture imploy'd and confided in, more than any other, by my brother.</P>
<P>This is not an honourable way of proceeding in Mr. Lovelace.&mdash;Did he learn this infamous practice of corrupting the &s;ervants of other families at the French Court, where he re&s;ided a good while?</P>
<P>I have been often jealous of this Leman in my little airings and poultry-vi&s;its: I have thought him (doubly ob&s;equious, as he was always to me) my brother's &s;py
<PB N="102" REF="104">
upon me; and, altho' he oblig'd me by his ha&s;tening out of the garden, and poultry-yard, whenever I came into either, have wonder'd, that from his reports my liberties of tho&s;e kinds have not been abridged. So, po&s;&s;ibly, this man may take a bribe of both, and yet betray both. Worthy views want not &s;uch obliquities as the&s;e on either &s;ide. An hone&s;t mind mu&s;t ri&s;e in|to indignation both at the traitor-maker and the traitor.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He pre&s;&s;es with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s for an in|terview. He would not offer, he &s;ays, to di&s;obey my la&s;t per&s;onal commands, that he &s;hould not endeavour to attend me again in the wood-hou&s;e. But &s;ays, he can give me &s;uch rea&s;ons, for my permitting him to wait upon my father or uncles, as he hopes will be approved by me: For be cannot help ob&s;erving, that it is no more &s;uitable to my own &s;pirit than to his, that he, a man of fortune and family, &s;hould be obliged to pur&s;ue &s;uch a clan|de&s;tine addre&s;s, as would only become a vile for|tune-hunter. But, if I will give my con&s;ent for his vi&s;iting me like a man, and a gentleman, no treat|ment &s;hall provoke him to forfeit his temper.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'His uncle will accompany him, if I plea&s;e: Or his aunt Lawrance will fir&s;t make the vi&s;it to my mamma, or to my aunt Hervey, or even to my uncles, if I choo&s;e it. And &s;uch terms &s;hall be of|fer'd, as <HI>&s;hall</HI> have weight upon them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He begs, that I will not deny him making a vi&s;it to Mr. Solmes. By all that's good, he vows, that it &s;hall not be with the lea&s;t intention either to hurt or affront him; but only to &s;et before him calmly and rationally, the con&s;equences that may po&s;&s;ibly flow from &s;o fruitle&s;s a per&s;everance; as well as the ungenerous folly of it; to a mind &s;o noble as mine. He repeats his own re&s;olution to attend my plea&s;ure, and Mr. Morden's arrival and advice, for the re|ward of his own patience.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="105">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It is impo&s;&s;ible, he &s;ays, but one of the&s;e me|thods? <HI>mu&s;t</HI> do. Pre&s;ence, he ob&s;erves, even of a di&s;|liked per&s;on, takes off the edge from re&s;entments which ab&s;ence whets, and makes keen.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He therefore mo&s;t earne&s;tly repeats his impor|tunities for the &s;upplicated interview.'</Q>
Says,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He has bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence in London: But cannot &s;tir from the inconvenient &s;pot, where he has for &s;ome time re&s;ided in di&s;gui&s;es unworthy of him&s;elf, until he can be ab&s;olutely certain, that I &s;hall not be prevailed upon, either by force or otherwi&s;e; and until he finds me deliver'd from the in&s;ults of my brother. Nor ought This to be an indifferent point to one, for who&s;e &s;ake, all the world reports me to be u&s;ed &s;o unworthily as I am u&s;ed.&mdash;But <HI>one</HI> remark, he &s;ays, he cannot help making; That did my friends know the little favour I &s;hew him, and the very great di&s;tance I keep him at, they would have no rea&s;on to confine me, on his account: And <HI>another,</HI> that they them&s;elves &s;eem to think him intitled to a different u&s;age, and expect that he receives it; when, in truth, what he meets with from me is exactly what they wi&s;h him to meet with, excepting in the favour of the corre&s;pondence I ho|nour him with: upon which, he &s;ays, he puts the highe&s;t value, and for the &s;ake of which he has chearfully &s;ubmitted to a thou&s;and indignities.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He renews his profe&s;&s;ions of reformation: He is convinc'd, he &s;ays, that he has already run a long and dangerous cour&s;e; and that it is high time to think of returning: It mu&s;t be from proper convic|tions, he &s;ays, that a per&s;on who has lived too gay a life re&s;olves to reclaim, before age or &s;ufferings come upon him.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'All generous &s;pirits, he ob&s;erves, hate compul&s;ion. Upon this ob&s;ervation he dwells; but regrets, that he is likely to owe all his hopes to this compul&s;ion; this <HI>injudicious</HI> compul&s;ion, he ju&s;tly calls it; and

none to my e&s;teem for him.

<P>I AM ju&s;t return'd from depo&s;iting my billet. How diligent is this man! It is plain he was in waiting: For I had walked but a few paces, after I had de|po&s;ited it, when, my heart mi&s;giving me, I return'd, to have taken it back, in order to recon&s;ider it as I walked, and whether I &s;hould, or &s;hould not, let it go: But I found it gone.</P>
<P>In all probability, there was but a brick wall, of a few inches thick, between Mr. Lovelace and me, at the very time I put the letter under the brick.</P>
<P>I am come back di&s;&s;atisfy'd with my&s;elf. But I think, my dear, there can be no harm in meeting him: If I do <HI>not,</HI> he may take &s;ome violent mea&s;ures: What he knows of the treatment I meet with in ma|lice to him, and with a view to fru&s;trate all his hopes, may make him de&s;perate. His behaviour la&s;t time I

&s;aw him, under the di&s;advantages of time and place, and &s;urpri&s;ed as I was, gives me no apprehen&s;ion of any thing but di&s;covery. What he requires is not unrea&s;onable, and cannot affect my future choice and determination: It is only to a&s;&s;ure him from my own lips, that I will never be the wife of a man I hate. If I have not an opportunity to meet without hazard or detection, he mu&s;t once more bear the di&s;appoint|ment. All his trouble, and mine too, is owing to his faulty character. This, altho' I hate tyranny and arrogance in all &s;hapes, makes me think le&s;s of the ri&s;ques he runs, and the fatigues he undergoes, than otherwi&s;e I &s;hould do; and &s;till le&s;s, as my &s;ufferings (derived from the &s;ame &s;ource) are greater than his.</P>
<P>Betty confirms the intimation, that I mu&s;t go to my uncle's on Thur&s;day. She was &s;ent on purpo&s;e to direct me to prepare my&s;elf for going, and to help me to get up every thing in order to it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Tue&s;day, Three o' Clock, March 28.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE mention'd &s;everal times the pertne&s;s of Mrs. Betty to me; and now, having a little time upon my hands, I will give you a &s;hort dialogue that pa&s;&s;ed ju&s;t now between us: It may, perhaps, be a little relief to you from the dull &s;ubjects with which I am perpetually teazing you.</P>
<P>As &s;he attended me at dinner, &s;he took notice, That Nature is &s;atisfy'd with a very little nouri&s;hment: And thus &s;he complimentally proved it:&mdash;For, Mi&s;s, &s;aid &s;he, you eat nothing; yet never looked more charm|ingly in your life.</P>
<P>As to the former part of your &s;peech, Betty, &s;aid I, you ob&s;erve well; and I have often thought, when
<PB N="106" REF="108">
I have &s;een how healthy the children of the labour|ing poor <HI>look,</HI> and <HI>are,</HI> with empty &s;tomachs, and hardly a good meal in a week, that Providence is very kind to its creatures, in this re&s;pect, as well as in all others, in making <HI>Much</HI> not nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of life; when three parts in four of its creatures, if it were, would not know how to obtain it. It puts me in mind of two proverbial &s;entences, which are full of admirable meaning.</P>
<P>What, pray, Mi&s;s, are they? I love to hear you talk, when you are &s;o &s;edate as you &s;eem now to be.</P>
<P>The one is to the purpo&s;e we are &s;peaking of; <HI>Poverty is the mother of health:</HI> And let me tell you, Betty, if I had a better appetite, and were to en|courage it, with &s;o little re&s;t, and &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s and per&s;ecution, I don't think I &s;hould be able to pre|&s;erve my rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>There's no inconvenience but has its convenience,</HI> &s;aid Betty, giving me proverb for proverb. But what is the other, Madam?</P>
<P>That the <HI>plea&s;ures of the mighty are obtain'd by the tears of the poor:</HI> It is but reasonable therefore, me|thinks, that the plenty of the one &s;hould be followed by di&s;tempers; and that the indigence of the other &s;hould be attended with that health, which makes all its other di&s;comforts light on the compari&s;on. And hence a third proverb, Betty, &s;ince you are an ad|mirer of proverbs; <HI>Better a bare foot, than none at all</HI>; that is to &s;ay, than not to be able to walk.</P>
<P>She was mightily taken with what I &s;aid: See, &s;aid &s;he, what a fine thing &s;cholar&s;hip is!&mdash;I, &s;aid &s;he, had always, from a girl, a ta&s;te for reading, tho' it were but in <HI>Mother Goo&s;e,</HI> and concerning the <HI>Fairies</HI> [And then &s;he took genteelly a pinch of &s;nuff]: Could but my parents <HI>have let go as fa&s;t as I pulled,</HI> I &s;hould have been a very happy creature.</P>
<P>Very likely, you would have made great improve|ments, Betty: But as it is, I cannot &s;ay, but &s;ince I
<PB N="107" REF="109">
have had the favour of your attendance in this <HI>intimate</HI> manner, I have heard &s;marter things from you, than I have heard at table from &s;ome of my brother's fel|low-collegians.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, dear Mi&s;s; dropping me one of her be&s;t courte&s;ies: So fine a judge as you are!&mdash;It is enough to make one very proud. Then, with an|other pinch&mdash;I cannot indeed but &s;ay, bridling upon it, that I have heard famous &s;cholars often and often &s;ay very &s;illy things: Things I &s;hould be a&s;hamed my&s;elf to &s;ay&mdash;But I thought they did it out of humi|lity, and in conde&s;cen&s;ion to tho&s;e who had not their learning.</P>
<P>That &s;he might not be too proud, I told her, I would ob&s;erve, that the liveline&s;s and quickne&s;s &s;he &s;o happily di&s;covered in her&s;elf, was not &s;o much an honour to her, as what &s;he owed to her <HI>Sex</HI>; which, as I had ob&s;erved in many in&s;tances, had great ad|vantages over the other, in all the powers that related to imagination: And hence, Mrs. Betty, you'll take notice, as I have of late had opportunity to do, that your own talent at repartee and &s;martne&s;s, when it has <HI>&s;omething to work upon,</HI> di&s;plays it&s;elf to more ad|vantage, than could well be expected from one who&s;e friends, to &s;peak in your own phra&s;e, could not <HI>let go &s;o fa&s;t as you pulled.</HI></P>
<P>The wench gave me a proof of the truth of my ob&s;ervation, in a manner &s;till more alert than I had expected: If, &s;aid &s;he, our &s;ex have &s;o much advan|tage in <HI>&s;martne&s;s,</HI> it is the le&s;s to be wondered at, that <HI>you,</HI> Mi&s;s, who have had &s;uch an education, &s;hould outdo all the men and women too, that come near you.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, Betty, &s;aid I, what a proof do you give me of your wit and your courage at the &s;ame time! This is outdoing your&s;elf. It would make young Ladies le&s;s proud, and more apprehen&s;ive, were they generally attended by &s;uch &s;mart &s;ervants, and their
<PB N="108" REF="110">
mouths permitted to be unlocked upon them, as yours has lately been upon me!&mdash;But, take away, Mrs. Betty.</P>
<P>Why, Mi&s;s, you have eat nothing at all:&mdash;I hope you are not di&s;plea&s;ed with your dinner for any thing I have &s;aid.</P>
<P>No, Mrs. Betty, I am pretty well u&s;ed to your freedoms, now, you know.&mdash;I am not di&s;plea&s;ed in the main, to ob&s;erve, that, were the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of modern fine Ladies to be extinct, it might be &s;upplied from tho&s;e whom they place in the next rank to them|&s;elves, their chambermaids and confidants. Your young mi&s;tre&s;s has contributed a great deal to this quickne&s;s of yours. She always preferred your company to mine. As <HI>you pulled, &s;he let go</HI>; and &s;o, Mrs. Betty, you have gained by <HI>her</HI> conver&s;ation what I have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Why, Mi&s;s, if you come to that, no-body &s;ays better things than Mi&s;s Harlowe. I could tell you one, if <HI>I plea&s;ed,</HI> upon my ob&s;erving to her, that you lived of late upon air, and had no &s;tomach to any thing, yet looked as charmingly as ever.&mdash;</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, it was a very good-natured one, Mrs. Betty!&mdash;Do you then <HI>plea&s;e</HI> that I &s;hall hear it?</P>
<P>Only this, Mi&s;s, <HI>That your &s;tomachfulne&s;s had &s;wallowed up your &s;tomach</HI>; and, <HI>That ob&s;tinacy was meat, drink, and cloth to you.</HI></P>
<P>Ay, Mrs. Betty; and <HI>did</HI> &s;he &s;ay This?&mdash;I hope &s;he laughed when &s;he &s;aid it, as &s;he does at all her <HI>good things,</HI> as &s;he calls them. It was very &s;mart, and very witty. I wi&s;h my mind were &s;o much at ea&s;e, as to aim at being witty too. But if you ad|mire &s;uch &s;ententious &s;ayings, I'll help you to an|other; and that is, <HI>Encouragement and Approbation make people &s;hew talents they were never &s;u&s;pected to have</HI>; and This will do both for mi&s;tre&s;s and maid: And another I'll furni&s;h you with, the contrary of the former, that will do only for me; That <HI>Per&s;ecution
<PB N="109" REF="111">
and Di&s;couragement depre&s;s</HI> ingenuous <HI>minds, and blunt the edge of lively imaginations.</HI>&mdash;And hence may my &s;i&s;ter's Brilliancy and my Stupidity be both accounted for. <HI>Ingenuous,</HI> you mu&s;t know, Mrs. Betty, and <HI>ingenious,</HI> are two things; and I would not arrogate the latter to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lord, Mi&s;s, &s;aid the Fooli&s;h, you know a great deal for your years.&mdash;You are a very learned young Lady!&mdash;What pity&mdash;</P>
<P>None of your <HI>pities,</HI> Mrs. Betty. I know what you'd &s;ay. But tell me, if you can, Is it re&s;olved that I &s;hall be carry'd to my uncle Antony's on Thur&s;day?</P>
<P>I was willing to reward my&s;elf for the patience &s;he had made me exerci&s;e, by getting at what intelligence I could from her.</P>
<P>Why, Mi&s;s, &s;eating her&s;elf at a little di&s;tance (ex|cu&s;e my &s;itting down), with the &s;nuff-box tapp'd very &s;martly, the lid opened, and a pinch taken with a dainty finger and thumb, the other three fingers di|&s;tendedly bent, and with a fine flouri&s;h&mdash;I cannot but &s;ay, that it is my opinion, you will certainly go on Thur&s;day; and this <HI>nole&s;s fole&s;s,</HI> as I have heard my young Lady &s;ay in FRENCH.</P>
<P>Whether I am <HI>willing</HI> or <HI>not willing,</HI> you mean, I &s;uppo&s;e, Mrs. Betty?</P>
<P>You have it, Mi&s;s.</P>
<P>Well but, Betty, I have no mind to be turned out of doors &s;o &s;uddenly. Do you think I could not be permitted to tarry one week longer?</P>
<P>How can I tell, Mi&s;s?</P>
<P>O Mrs. Betty, you can tell a great deal, if <HI>you plea&s;e.</HI> But here I am forbid writing to any one of my family; none of it now will come near <HI>me</HI>; nor will any of it permit me to &s;ee <HI>them:</HI> How &s;hall I do to make my reque&s;t known, to tarry here a week or fortnight longer!</P>
<P>Why, Mi&s;s, I fan&s;y, if you were to &s;hew a com|pliable
<PB N="110" REF="112">
temper, your friends would &s;hew a compliable one too. But would you expect favours, and grant none?</P>
<P>Smartly put, Betty! But who knows what may be the re&s;ult of my being carried to my uncle An|tony's?</P>
<P>Who knows, Mi&s;s!&mdash;Why any-body will gue&s;s what may be the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>As how, Betty?</P>
<P><HI>As how!</HI> repeated the pert wench, Why, Mi&s;s, you will &s;tand in your own light, as you have hitherto done: And your parents, as &s;uch good parents <HI>ought,</HI> will be obeyed.</P>
<P>If, Mrs. Betty, I had not been u&s;ed to your <HI>oughts,</HI> and to have my duty laid down to me, by your ora|culous wi&s;dom, I &s;hould be apt to &s;tare at the liberty of your &s;peech.</P>
<P>You &s;eem angry, Mi&s;s. I hope I take no un|becoming liberty.</P>
<P>If thou really think'&s;t thou do&s;t not, thy ignorance is more to be pitied, than thy pertne&s;s re&s;ented. I wi&s;h thou'd'&s;t leave me to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>When young Ladies fall out with their <HI>own</HI> duty, it is not much to be wondered at, that they are angry at any-body who do <HI>theirs.</HI></P>
<P>That's a very pretty &s;aying, Mrs. Betty!&mdash;I &s;ee plainly what <HI>thy</HI> duty is in <HI>thy</HI> notion, and am obliged to tho&s;e who taught it thee.</P>
<P>Every-body takes notice, Mi&s;s, that you can &s;ay very cutting words in a cool manner, and yet not call names, as I have known <HI>&s;ome</HI> gentlefolks, as well as others, do, when in a pa&s;&s;ion. But I wi&s;h you had permitted 'Squire Solmes to &s;ee you; he would have told you &s;uch &s;tories of 'Squire Lovelace, as would have turned your heart again&s;t him for ever.</P>
<P>And know you any of the particulars of tho&s;e &s;ad &s;tories?</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="113">Indeed, I don't; but you'll hear all at your uncle Antony's, I &s;uppo&s;e; and a great deal more, perhaps, than you will like to hear.</P>
<P>Let me hear what I will, I am determined again&s;t Mr. Solmes, were it to co&s;t me my life.</P>
<P>If you are, Mi&s;s, the Lord have mercy on you! For what with this letter of yours to 'Squire Solmes, whom they &s;o much value, and what with their anti|pathy to 'Squire Lovelace, whom they hate, they will have no patience with you.</P>
<P>What will they do, Betty? They won't kill me? What <HI>will</HI> they do?</P>
<P>Kill you! No!&mdash;But you will not be &s;uffered to &s;tir from thence, till you have complied with your duty. And <HI>no pen and ink</HI> will be allowed you, as here; where they are of opinion you make no good u&s;e of it: Nor would it be allowed here, only as they intend &s;o &s;oon to &s;end you away to your uncle's. No|body will be permitted to &s;ee you, or to corre&s;pond with you. What farther will be done, I can't &s;ay; and, if I could, it may not be proper. But you may prevent it all, by One word: And I wi&s;h you would, Mi&s;s. All then would be ea&s;y and happy. And, if I may &s;peak my mind, I &s;ee not why one man is not as good as another: Why, e&s;pecially, a &s;ober man is not as good as a rake.</P>
<P>Well, Betty, &s;aid I, &s;ighing, all thy impertinence goes for nothing. But I &s;ee I am de&s;tined to be a very unhappy creature. Yet will I venture upon one reque&s;t more to them.</P>
<P>And &s;o, quite &s;ick of the pert creature, and of my|&s;elf, I retired to my clo&s;et, and wrote a few lines to my uncle Harlowe, notwith&s;tanding his prohibition; in order to get a reprieve, from being carried away &s;o &s;oon as Thur&s;day next, if I mu&s;t go. And This, that I might, if comply'd with, &s;u&s;pend the appoint|ment I have made with Mr. Lovelace; for my heart mi&s;gives me, as to meeting him; and that more and

<P>I HAVE depo&s;ited my letter to Mr. Lovelace. Threatening as things look again&s;t me, I am much better plea&s;ed with my&s;elf, than I was before. I reckon he will be a little out of humour upon it, however. But as I re&s;erved to my&s;elf the liberty of changing my mind; and as it is ea&s;y for him to ima|gine there may be rea&s;ons for it <HI>within</HI>-doors, which he cannot judge of <HI>without</HI>; and I have &s;ugge&s;ted to him &s;ome of them; I &s;hould think it &s;trange, if he acquie&s;ces not, on this occa&s;ion, with a chearfulne&s;s, which may &s;hew me, that his la&s;t letter is the genuine product of his heart: For if he be really &s;o much concerned at his pa&s;t faults, as he pretends, and has for &s;ome time pretended, mu&s;t he not, of cour&s;e, have corrected, in &s;ome degree, the impetuo&s;ity of his tem|per? The fir&s;t &s;tep to reformation, as I conceive, is to &s;ubdue &s;udden gu&s;ts of pa&s;&s;ion, from which fre|quently the greate&s;t evils ari&s;e, and to learn to bear di&s;appointments. If the ira&s;cible pa&s;&s;ions cannot be overcome, what opinion &s;hall one have of the per&s;on's power over tho&s;e to which bad habit, joined to <HI>greater</HI> temptation, gives &s;tronger force?</P>
<P>Pray, my dear, be &s;o kind, as to make inquiry by &s;ome &s;afe hand, after the di&s;gui&s;es Mr. Lovelace a&s;|&s;umes at the inn he puts up at in the poor village of Neale, he calls it. If it be the &s;ame I take it to be, I never knew it was con&s;iderable enough to have a name; nor that it has an inn in it.</P>

<P>I AM ju&s;t return'd from my morning walk, and already have received a letter from Mr. Lovelace in an&s;wer to mine depo&s;ited la&s;t night. He mu&s;t have had pen, ink, and paper, with him; for it was writ|ten in the coppice; with this circum&s;tance; On one knee, kneeling with the other. Not from reverence to the written-to, however, as you'll find.</P>
<P>Well are we in&s;tructed early to keep this &s;ex at a di&s;tance. An unde&s;igning open heart, where it is loth to di&s;oblige, is ea&s;ily drawn in, I &s;ee, to oblige more than ever it de&s;igned. It is too apt to govern it&s;elf by what a bold &s;pirit is encouraged to <HI>expect</HI> of it. It is very difficult for a good natured young per&s;on to give a negative where it di&s;e&s;teems not.</P>
<P>One's heart may harden and contract, as one gains experience, and when we have &s;marted perhaps for our ea&s;y folly: And &s;o it <HI>ought,</HI> or it would be upon very unequal terms with the world.</P>
<P>Excu&s;e the&s;e grave reflections. This man has vex'd me heartily. I &s;ee his gentlene&s;s was <HI>art</HI>; fiercene&s;s, and a temper like what I have been too much u&s;ed to at home, are <HI>nature</HI> in him. In the mind I am in, nothing &s;hall ever make me forgive him, &s;ince there can be no good rea&s;on for his impatience on an ex|pectation given with re&s;erve, and ab&s;olutely revo|cable.

<P>WE cannot always an&s;wer for what we <HI>can</HI> do: But to convince you, that I can keep my above re|&s;olution, with regard to This Lovelace, angry as my letter is, and three hours as it is &s;ince it was written, I a&s;&s;ure you, that I repent it not, nor will &s;often it, altho' I find it is not taken away. And yet I hardly ever before did any-thing in anger, that I did not re|pent in half an hour; and que&s;tion my&s;elf in <HI>le&s;s</HI> than that time, whether I was right or wrong.</P>
<P>In this re&s;pite till Tue&s;day, I have a little time to look about me, as I may &s;ay, and con&s;ider of what I <HI>have</HI> to do, and <HI>can</HI> do.

<P>AN accident has occa&s;ioned my remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, as, till you know it, you may ju&s;tly think my &s;ilence.</P>
<P>My mamma was &s;ent for on Sunday night, with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, by her cou&s;in Larkin, whom I mentioned in one of my former.</P>
<P>This poor woman was always afraid of Death, and was one of tho&s;e weak per&s;ons who imagine that the
<PB N="123" REF="125">
making of their Will mu&s;t be an undoubted fore|runner of it.</P>
<P>She had always &s;aid, when urged to the nece&s;&s;ary work, That whenever &s;he made it, &s;he &s;hould not live long after; and, one would think, imagined &s;he was under an obligation to prove her words: For, tho' &s;he had been long bed-rid, and was, in a man|ner, worn out before, yet &s;he thought her&s;elf better, till &s;he was per&s;uaded to make it: And from that moment, remembering what &s;he u&s;ed to progno&s;ticate (her <HI>fears helping on what &s;he feared,</HI> as is often the ca&s;e, particularly in the Small-Pox), grew wor&s;e; and had it in her head once to burn her Will, in hopes to grow better upon it.</P>
<P>She &s;ent my mamma word, That the Doctors had given her over: But that &s;he could not die till &s;he &s;aw her. I told my mamma, That if &s;he wi&s;h'd her a chance for recovery, &s;he &s;hould not, for <HI>that</HI> rea&s;on, go. But go &s;he would; and, what was wor&s;e, would make me go with her; and that, at an hour's warning [Had there been more time for argumenta|tion, to be &s;ure I had not gone!] for &s;he &s;aid nothing of it to me, till &s;he was ri&s;ing in the morning <HI>early,</HI> re&s;olving to return <HI>at night.</HI> So that there was a kind of nece&s;&s;ity, that my preparation to obey her, &s;hould, in a manner, accompany her command.&mdash;A com|mand &s;o much out of the way, on &s;uch a &s;olemn oc|ca&s;ion! And this I repre&s;ented&mdash;But to no purpo&s;e:&mdash;There never was &s;uch a contradicting girl in the world&mdash;<HI>My</HI> wi&s;dom always made <HI>her</HI> a fool!&mdash;But &s;he <HI>would</HI> be obliged <HI>this time,</HI> proper or improper.</P>
<P>I have but one way of accounting for this &s;udden whim of my mamma&mdash;She had a mind to accept of Mr. Hickman's offer to e&s;corte her:&mdash;And I verily believe [I wi&s;h I were quite &s;ure of it] had a mind to oblige him with my company&mdash;as far as I know, to keep me out of <HI>wor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>For, would you believe it,?&mdash;As &s;ure as you are
<PB N="124" REF="126">
alive, &s;he is afraid for her favourite Hickman, be|cau&s;e of the long vi&s;it your Lovelace, tho' &s;o much by accident, made me in her ab&s;ence, la&s;t time &s;he was at the &s;ame place. I hope, my dear, <HI>you</HI> are not jealous too. But, indeed, I now and then, when &s;he teazes me with prai&s;es which Hickman cannot de&s;erve, in return, fall to prai&s;ing tho&s;e qualities and per&s;onalities in Lovelace, which the other never will have. Indeed I do love to teaze a little bit, that I do.&mdash;My mamma's girl!&mdash;I had like to have &s;aid.</P>
<P>As you know &s;he is as pa&s;&s;ionate, as I am pert, you will not wonder to be told, that we generally fall out on the&s;e occa&s;ions: She flies from me, at the long run: It would be undutiful in me to leave her <HI>fir&s;t</HI>&mdash;And then I get an opportunity to pur&s;ue our <HI>corre&s;pondence.</HI></P>
<P>For, now I am rambling, let me tell you, that &s;he does not much favour <HI>that</HI>;&mdash;for <HI>two</HI> rea&s;ons, I be|lieve: One, that I don't &s;hew her all that pa&s;&s;es be|tween us; the other, That &s;he thinks I harden your mind again&s;t your duty, as it is called; and with <HI>her,</HI> for a rea&s;on at home, as I have hinted more than once, parents cannot do wrong; children cannot op|po&s;e, and be right. This obliges me now-and-then to <HI>&s;teal</HI> an hour, as I may &s;ay, and not let her know how I am employ'd.</P>
<P>You may gue&s;s from what I have written, how aver&s;e I was to comply with this &s;tretch of motherly authority, made &s;o much again&s;t rhyme and rea&s;on.&mdash;But it came to be a <HI>te&s;t of duty</HI>; &s;o I was obliged to yield, tho' with a full per&s;ua&s;ion of being in the right.</P>
<P>I have always your reproofs upon the&s;e occa&s;ions: In your late letters &s;tronger than ever. A good rea|&s;on why, you'll &s;ay, Becau&s;e more de&s;erved than ever. I thank you kindly for your correction. I hope to make <HI>cor</HI>-rection of it&mdash;But let me tell you, that
<PB N="125" REF="127">
your &s;tripe's, whether de&s;erved or not, have made me &s;en&s;ible deeper than the &s;kin&mdash;But of this another time.</P>
<P>It was Monday afternoon before we reached the old gentlewoman's. That fiddling, parading fellow, you know who I mean, made us wait for him two hours (and I to go a journey I di&s;liked!) only for the &s;ake of having a little more tawdry upon his hou&s;ings; which he had hurry'd his &s;addler to put on, to make him look fine, being to e&s;corte his dear Madam Howe, and her fair daughter.&mdash;I told him, that I &s;uppo&s;ed he was afraid, that the double &s;olemnity in the ca&s;e, that of the vi&s;it to a dying woman, and that of his own countenance, would give him the appearance of an <HI>undertaker</HI>; to avoid, which, he ran into as bad an extreme, and I doubted would be taken for a <HI>mountebank.</HI></P>
<P>The man was confounded. He took it as &s;trongly, as if his con&s;cience gave a&s;&s;ent to the ju&s;tice of the remark.&mdash;Otherwi&s;e, he would have borne it better: For he is u&s;ed enough to this &s;ort of treatment. I thought he would have cry'd. I have heretofore ob|&s;erved, that on this &s;ide of the contract, he &s;eems to be a mighty meek &s;ort of creature.&mdash;And tho' I &s;hould like it in him <HI>hereafter,</HI> perhaps, yet I can't help de&s;pi&s;ing him a little in my heart for it <HI>now.</HI> I believe, my dear, we all love your blu&s;tering fellows be&s;t; could we but direct the blu&s;ter, and bid it roar when, and at whom, we plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The poor man looked at my mamma. She was &s;o angry [My airs upon it, and my oppo&s;ition to the journey, having all helped], that for half the way &s;he would not &s;peak to me. And when &s;he did, it was, I wi&s;h I had not brought you!&mdash;You know not what it is to conde&s;cend. It is <HI>my</HI> fault, not <HI>Mr. Hick|man</HI>'s, that you are here, &s;o much again&s;t your will.&mdash;Have you no eyes for this &s;ide of the chariot?</P>
<P>And then he far'd the better from <HI>her,</HI> as he always
<PB N="126" REF="128">
does, for faring wor&s;e from <HI>me:</HI> For there was, how do you <HI>now,</HI> Sir? And how do you <HI>now,</HI> Mr. Hick|man? as he ambled now on this &s;ide of the chariot, now on that, &s;tealing a prim look at me; <HI>her</HI> head half out of the chariot, kindly &s;miling as if marry'd to the man but a fortnight her&s;elf: While I always &s;aw &s;omething to divert my&s;elf, on the &s;ide of the chariot where the hone&s;t man was not, were it but old Robin at a di&s;tance, on his Roan Keffel.</P>
<P>Our court&s;hip-days, they &s;ay, are our be&s;t days. Favour de&s;troys court&s;hip. Di&s;tance increa&s;es it. Its e&s;&s;ence is di&s;tance. And to &s;ee how familiar the&s;e men-wretches grow upon a &s;mile, what an awe they are &s;truck into when one frowns! Who would not make them &s;tand off? Who would not enjoy a power, that is to be &s;o &s;hort-lived?</P>
<P>Don't chide me one bit for this, my dear. It is in nature. I can't help it: Nay, for that matter, I love it, and wi&s;h not to help it. So &s;pare your gra|vity, I be&s;eech you on this &s;ubject. I &s;et not up for a perfect character. The man will bear it. And what need you care? My mamma over-balances all he &s;uf|fers: And if he thinks him&s;elf unhappy, he ought never to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Then, did he not de&s;erve a fit of the &s;ullens, think you, to make us lo&s;e our dinner, for his parade, &s;ince in &s;o &s;hort a journey one would not bait, and lo&s;e the opportunity of coming back that night, had the old gentlewoman's condition permitted it? To &s;ay no|thing of being the cau&s;e, that my mamma was in the glout with her poor daughter all the way.</P>
<P>At our alighting I gave him another dab; but it was but a little one. Yet the manner, and the air, made up (as I intended they &s;hould) for that defect. My mamma's hand was kindly put into his, with a &s;impering altogether bridal; and with another, How do you now, Sir?&mdash;All his plump mu&s;cles were in motion, and a double charge of care and ob&s;equiou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB N="127" REF="129">
fidgetted up his whole form, when he offer'd to me his officious palm. My mamma, when I was a girl, always bid me hold up my head. I ju&s;t then remember'd her commands, and was dutiful: I ne|ver held up my head &s;o high. With an averted &s;u|percilious eye, and a rejecting hand, half-flouri&s;hing&mdash;I have no need of help, Sir!&mdash;You are in my way.</P>
<P>He ran back, as if on wheels; with a face exce&s;|&s;ively mortify'd: I had thoughts el&s;e to have follow'd the too gentle touch, with a declaration, that I had as many hands and feet as him&s;elf: But this would have been telling him a piece of news, as to the latter, that I hope, he had not the pre&s;umption to gue&s;s at.</P>
<P>WE found the poor woman, as we thought, at the la&s;t ga&s;p. Had we come <HI>&s;ooner,</HI> we could not have got away, as we intended, that night. You &s;ee I am for excu&s;ing the man all I can; and yet, I a&s;&s;ure you, I have not &s;o much as a <HI>conditional liking</HI> to him. My mamma &s;at up mo&s;t part of the night, expecting every hour would have been her poor cou&s;in's la&s;t. I bore her company till two.</P>
<P>I never &s;aw the approaches of death in a grown per&s;on before; and was extremely &s;hock'd. Death, to one in health, is a very terrible thing. We pity the per&s;on for what <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;uffers: And we pity our|&s;elves for what <HI>we</HI> mu&s;t &s;ome time hence, in like &s;ort, &s;uffer; and &s;o are <HI>doubly</HI> affected.</P>
<P>She held out till Tue&s;day morning, eleven; and having told my mamma, that &s;he had left her an exe|cutrix, and her and me rings and mourning; we were employ'd all that day, in matters of the Will; [By which my cou&s;in Jenny Fynnett is hand&s;omely provided for]; &s;o that it was Wedne&s;day morning early, before we &s;et out on our return.</P>
<P>It is true, we got home (having no hou&s;ings to &s;tay for) by noon: But tho' I &s;ent Robin away be|fore
<PB N="128" REF="130">
he alitt; and he brought me back a whole packet, down to the &s;ame Wedne&s;day noon; yet was I really &s;o fatigued (and &s;hock'd, as I mu&s;t own, at the hard death of the old gentlewoman); my mamma likewi&s;e [who has no rea&s;on to di&s;like this world] being in|di&s;po&s;ed from the &s;ame occa&s;ion; that I could not &s;et about writing, time enough, for Robin's return that night.</P>
<P>But having recruited my &s;pirits, my mamma hav|ing al&s;o had a good night, I aro&s;e with the dawn, to write this, and get it di&s;patched time enough for your breakfa&s;t-airing; that your &s;u&s;pen&s;e may be as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I WILL &s;oon follow This with another. I will employ a per&s;on directly to find out how Lovelace behaves him&s;elf at his inn. Such a bu&s;y &s;pirit mu&s;t be traceable.</P>
<P>But, perhaps, my dear, you are indifferent now about him, or his employments; for this reque&s;t was made before he <HI>mortally</HI> offended you. Neverthe|le&s;s, I will have inquiry made. The re&s;ult, it is very probable, will be of u&s;e to confirm you in your pre&s;ent unforgiving temper.&mdash;And yet, if the <HI>poor</HI> man [Shall I pity him for <HI>you,</HI> my dear?] &s;hould be depriv'd of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing any man on earth can receive, and which he has the pre&s;umption, with &s;o little merit, to a&s;pire to; he will have run great ri&s;ques; caught great colds; hazarded fevers; &s;u&s;tained the highe&s;t indignities; brav'd the inclemencies of &s;kies, and all for&mdash;nothing!&mdash;Will not this move your <HI>ge|nero&s;ity</HI> (if nothing el&s;e) in his favour?&mdash;Poor Mr. Lovelace!&mdash;</P>
<P>I would occa&s;ion no throb; nor half-throb; no fla&s;h of &s;en&s;ibility, like lightning darting in, and as &s;oon &s;uppre&s;s'd, by a di&s;cretion that no one of the Sex ever before could give &s;uch an example of&mdash;I
<PB N="129" REF="131">
<HI>would not,</HI> I &s;ay; and yet, for a trial of <HI>you</HI> to <HI>your|&s;elf,</HI> rather than as an impertinent overflow of raillery in your friend, as money-takers try a &s;u&s;pected guinea by the <HI>&s;ound,</HI> let me, on &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition, &s;ound <HI>you,</HI> by repeating, <HI>Poor Mr. Lovelace!</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>And now, my dear, how is it with you? How do you now, as my mamma &s;ays to Mr. Hickman, when her pert daughter has made him look &s;or|rowful?</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day Morning.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Will now take &s;ome notice of your la&s;t favour. But being &s;o far behind-hand with you, mu&s;t be brief.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, as to your reproofs, thus &s;hall I di&s;charge my&s;elf of that part of my &s;ubject: Is it likely, think you, that I &s;hould avoid de&s;erving them now-and-then, occa&s;ionally, when I admire the man|ner in which you give me your rebukes, and love you the better for them? And when you are &s;o well <HI>in|titled</HI> to give them? For what faults can <HI>you</HI> po&s;&s;ibly have, unle&s;s your relations are &s;o kind as to find you a <HI>few</HI> to keep their <HI>many</HI> in countenance?&mdash;But, They are as kind to <HI>me</HI> in This, as to <HI>you</HI>; for I may venture to affirm, That any one who &s;hould read <HI>your</HI> letters, and would &s;ay, you were <HI>right,</HI> would not, on reading <HI>mine,</HI> condemn me for be|ing <HI>quite wrong.</HI></P>
<P>Your re&s;olution, not to leave your father's hou&s;e, is right&mdash;if you can &s;tay in it, and avoid being Solmes's wife.</P>
<P>I think you an&s;wer'd Solmes's letter, as <HI>I</HI> &s;hould have an&s;wer'd it.&mdash;Will you not compliment me and your&s;elf at once; by &s;aying, that <HI>That</HI> was right?</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132">You have, in your letters to your uncle, and the re&s;t, done all that you ought to do. You are wholly guiltle&s;s of the con&s;equence, be it what it will. To offer to give up your e&s;tate!&mdash;That would not I have done!&mdash;You &s;ee, this offer &s;tagger'd them: They took time to con&s;ider of it: They made my heart ake in the time they took: I was afraid they would have taken you at your word: And &s;o, but for &s;hame, and for fear of Lovelace, I dare &s;ay, they would.&mdash;You are too noble by half for them. This, I repeat, is an offer I would not have made. Let me beg of you, my dear, never to repeat the temptation to them.</P>
<P>I freely own to you, that their u&s;age of you upon it, and Lovelace's different behaviour in his letter received at the &s;ame time, would have made <HI>me</HI> his, pa&s;t re|demption. The duce take the man, I was going to &s;ay, for not having had &s;o much regard to his cha|racter and morals, as would have intirely ju&s;tify'd &s;uch a &s;tep in a <HI>Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe,</HI> per&s;ecuted as &s;he is!</P>
<P>I wonder not at your appointment with him. I may further touch upon &s;ome part of this &s;ubject by-and-by.</P>
<P>Pray, pray, I pray you now, my deare&s;t friend, contrive to &s;end your Betty Barnes to me!&mdash;Does the Coventry-act extend to women, know ye?&mdash;The lea&s;t I would do, &s;hould be, to &s;end her home well &s;ou&s;ed in, and dragged thro', our deepe&s;t hor&s;e-pond. I'll engage, if I get her hither, that &s;he &s;hall keep the anniver&s;ary of her deliverance as long as &s;he lives.</P>
<P>I wonder not at Lovelace's &s;aucy an&s;wer, &s;aucy as it really is. If he loves you as he ought, he mu&s;t be vex'd at &s;o great a di&s;appointment. The man mu&s;t have been a dete&s;table hypocrite, I think, had he not &s;hewn his vexation. Your expectations of &s;uch a Chri&s;tian command of temper in him, in a di&s;ap|pointment of this nature e&s;pecially, are too early, by
<PB N="131" REF="133">
almo&s;t half a century, in a man of his con&s;titution. But, neverthele&s;s, I am very far from blaming you for your re&s;entment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be all impatience to know how this matter ends between you and him. But a <HI>few inches of brick-wall</HI> between you &s;o lately; and now &s;uch <HI>mountains!</HI>&mdash;And you think to hold it!&mdash;May be &s;o!&mdash;</P>
<P>You &s;ee the temper he &s;hew'd in his preceding letter was not <HI>natural</HI> to him, you &s;ay. And did you before think it <HI>was?</HI> In&s;olent creepers and in|&s;inuators! Inch-allow'd, ell-taking incroachers!&mdash;This very Hickman, I make no doubt, will be as &s;aucy as your Lovelace, if ever he dare. He has not half the arrogant bravery of the other, and can better hide his horns; that's all. But whenever he has the power, depend upon it, he will <HI>butt</HI> at one as valiantly as the other.</P>
<P>If ever I &s;hould be per&s;uaded to have him, I &s;hall watch how the imperative Husband <HI>comes upon him</HI>; how the ob&s;equious Lover <HI>goes off</HI>; in &s;hort, how he <HI>a&s;cends,</HI> and how I <HI>de&s;cend,</HI> in the matrimonial wheel, never to take my turn again, but by fits and &s;tarts, like the feeble &s;truggles of a &s;inking &s;tate for its dying liberty.</P>
<P><HI>All good-natured men are pa&s;&s;ionate,</HI> &s;ays Mr. Love|lace. A pretty plea to a beloved object in the pleni|tude of her power! As much as to &s;ay, Greatly as I value you, Madam, I will not take pains to curb my pa&s;&s;ions to oblige you.&mdash;Methinks, I &s;hould be glad to hear from Mr. Hickman &s;uch a plea for good-nature as this!</P>
<P>Indeed, we are too apt to make allowances for &s;uch tempers as <HI>early</HI> indulgence has made uncon|troulable; and therefore habitually evil. But if a boi&s;trous temper, when under <HI>obligation,</HI> is to be thus allowed for, what, when the tables are turned, will it expect? You know a husband, who, I fancy,
<PB N="132" REF="134">
had &s;ome of the&s;e early allowances made for him: And you &s;ee, that neither him&s;elf, nor any-body el&s;e, is the happier for it!</P>
<P>The &s;uiting of the tempers of two per&s;ons who are to come together, is a great matter: And yet there &s;hould be boundaries fixed between them, by con&s;ent, as it were, beyond which neither &s;hould go: And each &s;hould hold the other to it; or there would pro|bably be incroachments in both. If the boundaries of the Three E&s;tates that con&s;titute our Political Union were not known, and occa&s;ionally a&s;&s;erted, what would become of each? The two branches of the Legi&s;lature would incroach upon each other; and the Executive power would &s;wallow up both.</P>
<P>If two per&s;ons of di&s;cretion, you'll &s;ay, come to|ther&mdash;</P>
<P>Ay, my dear, that's true: But, if none but per|&s;ons of di&s;cretion were to marry&mdash;And would it not &s;urpri&s;e you if I were to advance, that the per&s;ons of di&s;cretion are generally &s;ingle?&mdash;Such per&s;ons are apt to con&s;ider too much, to re&s;olve.&mdash;Are not you and I complimented as &s;uch?&mdash;And would either of us marry, if the fellows, and our friends, would let us alone?</P>
<P>But to the former point;&mdash;Had Lovelace made his addre&s;&s;es to me (unle&s;s, indeed, I had been taken with a liking for him <HI>more</HI> than <HI>conditional</HI>), I would have forbid him, upon the fir&s;t <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> in&s;tance of his <HI>good-nature,</HI> as he calls it, ever to &s;ee me more:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Thou mu&s;t bear with me, hone&s;t friend, might I have &s;aid (had I conde&s;cended to &s;ay any thing to him), an hundred times more than This:&mdash;Begone, therefore;&mdash;I bear with no pa&s;&s;ions that are predo|minant to That thou ha&s;t pretended for me.'</Q></P>
<P>But to one of <HI>your</HI> mild and gentle temper, it would be all one, were you marry'd, whether the man be a Lovelace or a Hickman in his &s;pirit.&mdash;You are &s;o obediently principled, that perhaps you would
<PB N="133" REF="135">
have told a mild man, that he mu&s;t not <HI>intreat,</HI> but <HI>command</HI>; and that it was beneath him not to exact from you the obedience you had &s;o &s;olemnly vow'd to him at the altar.&mdash;I know of old, my dear, your meek regard to that little piddling part of the mar|riage-vow, which &s;ome prerogative-monger foi&s;ted into the office, to make That a <HI>duty,</HI> which he knew was not a <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Our way of training-up,</HI> you &s;ay, <HI>makes us need the protection of the brave:</HI> Very true: And how ex|tremely brave and gallant is it, that this brave man will free us from all in&s;ults, but Tho&s;e which will go neare&s;t to us; that is to &s;ay, His own!</P>
<P>How artfully has Lovelace, in the ab&s;tract you give me of one of his letters, calculated to your me|ridian; <HI>Generous &s;pirits hate compul&s;ion!</HI>&mdash;He is cer|tainly a deeper creature by much than once we thought him. He knows, as you intimate, that his own wild pranks cannot be concealed; and &s;o owns ju&s;t enough to palliate (becau&s;e it teaches you not to be &s;urpri&s;ed at) any new one, that may come to your ears; and then, truly, he is (however faulty) a mighty <HI>inge|nuous</HI> man; and by no means an <HI>hypocrite:</HI> A cha|racter, when found out, the mo&s;t odious of all others, to <HI>our &s;ex,</HI> in the <HI>other</HI>; were it only becau&s;e it teaches us to doubt the ju&s;tice of the prai&s;es &s;uch a man gives us, when we are willing to believe them to be our due.</P>
<P>By means of this &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>ingenuity,</HI> Lovelace ob|tains a prai&s;e, in&s;tead of a merited di&s;prai&s;e; and, like an ab&s;olved confe&s;&s;ionaire, wipes off, as he goes along, one &s;core, to begin another: For an eye favourable to him will not magnify his faults; nor will a woman, willing to <HI>hope the be&s;t,</HI> forbear to impute to ill-will and prejudice all t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at charity can make &s;o imputable. And if &s;he even give credit to &s;uch of the unfavour|able imputations, as may be too flagrant to be doubt|ed; &s;he will be very apt to take in the <HI>future hope,</HI>

which he inculcates, and which to que&s;tion would be to que&s;tion her own power, and perhaps <HI>merit:</HI> And thus may a woman be inclined to make a <HI>&s;light,</HI> or even a <HI>fancied,</HI> virtue atone for the mo&s;t <HI>glaring</HI> vice.</P>
<P>I have a rea&s;on, a new one, for this preachment upon a text you have given me. But, till I am better inform'd, I will not explain my&s;elf. If it come out, as I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pect it will, the man, my dear, is a devil; and you mu&s;t rather think of&mdash;I prote&s;t I had like to have &s;aid&mdash;<HI>Solmes,</HI> than him.</P>
<P>But let This be as it will, &s;hall I tell you, how, after all his offences, he may creep in with you again?</P>
<P>I will.&mdash;Thus then: It is but to claim for him|&s;elf the <HI>good-natur'd character:</HI> And This, granted, will blot out the fault of <HI>pa&s;&s;ionate</HI> in&s;olence: And &s;o he will have nothing to do, but This hour to accu|&s;tom you to in&s;ult; the Next, to bring you to forgive him, upon his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: The con&s;equence will be, that he will, by this &s;ee-&s;aw teazing, break your re|&s;entment all to pieces: And then, a little <HI>more</HI> of the in&s;ult, and a little <HI>le&s;s</HI> of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, on his part, will go down, till nothing el&s;e but the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> will be &s;een, and not a bit of the <HI>&s;econd:</HI> You will then be afraid to provoke &s;o offen&s;ive a &s;pirit; and at la&s;t will be brought &s;o <HI>prettily,</HI> and &s;o <HI>audibly,</HI> to pronounce the little reptile word OBEY, that it will do one's heart good to hear you. The <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> wife takes place of the <HI>managed</HI> mi&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;And; if you doubt the progre&s;&s;ion, be plea&s;ed, my dear, to take your <HI>mamma</HI>'s judgment upon it.</P>
<P>But no more of This just now. Your &s;tory is be|come too arduous to dwell upon the&s;e &s;ort of topics. And yet this is but an <HI>affected levity</HI> with me. My heart, as I have heretofore &s;aid, is a &s;incere &s;harer in all your di&s;tre&s;&s;es. My &s;un&s;hine darts but thro' a drizly cloud. My eye, were you to &s;ee it, when it &s;eems to you &s;o <HI>gladden'd,</HI> as you mention in a for|mer, is more than ready to overflow, even at the
<PB N="135" REF="137">
very pa&s;&s;ages, perhaps, upon which you impute to me the <HI>archne&s;s</HI> of <HI>exultation.</HI></P>
<P>But now the unheard of cruelty and perver&s;ene&s;s of &s;ome of your friends[<HI>Relations,</HI> I &s;hould &s;ay; I am always blundering thus!]; the <HI>as</HI> &s;trange determined|ne&s;s of others; your pre&s;ent quarrel with Lovelace; and your approaching interview with Solmes, from which you are right to apprehend a great deal; are &s;uch con&s;iderable circum&s;tances in your &s;tory, that it is fit they &s;hould ingro&s;s all my attention.</P>
<P>You a&s;k me to advi&s;e you how to behave upon Solmes's vi&s;it. I <HI>cannot</HI> for my life. I know they expect a great deal from it: You had not el&s;e had your long day comply'd with. All I will &s;ay is, That if Solmes cannot be prevailed for, now, that Love|lace has &s;o much offended you, he never will. When the interview is over, I doubt not but that I &s;hall have rea&s;on to &s;ay, that All you did, that All you &s;aid, was right, and could not be better: Yet, if I don't think &s;o, I won't &s;ay &s;o; that I promi&s;e you.</P>
<P>Only, let me advi&s;e you, to pull up a &s;pirit, even to your uncle, if there be occa&s;ion. Re&s;ent the vile and fooli&s;h treatment you meet with, in which he has taken &s;o large a &s;hare, and make him a&s;ham'd of it, if you can.</P>
<P>I know not, upon recollection, but This interview may be a good thing for you, however de&s;ign'd. For when Solmes &s;ees (if that is to <HI>be</HI> &s;o), that it is im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould &s;ucceed with you; and your rela|tions &s;ee it too; the one mu&s;t, I think, recede, and the other come to terms with you; upon offers, that it is my opinion, will go hard enough with you to comply with; when the <HI>&s;till</HI> harder are di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in your la&s;t letters, as well as in your former, which authorize me to &s;ay This. But it would be un&s;ea&s;onable to touch this &s;ubject further ju&s;t now.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="138">But, upon the whole, I have no patience to &s;ee you thus made the &s;port of your brother's and &s;i&s;ter's cruelty: For what, after &s;o much &s;teadine&s;s on your part, in &s;o many trials, can be their hope?</P>
<P>I approve of your intention to &s;end out of their reach all the letters and papers you would not have them &s;ee. Methinks, I would wi&s;h you to depo&s;ite likewi&s;e a parcel of cloaths, linen, &amp;c. before your interview with Solmes; le&s;t you &s;hould not have an opportunity for it afterwards. Robin &s;hall fetch it away on the fir&s;t orders, by day or by night.</P>
<P>I am in hopes to procure from my mamma, if things come to extremity, leave for you to be pri|vately with us.</P>
<P>I will condition to be good-humour'd, and even <HI>kind,</HI> to HER favourite, if &s;he will &s;hew me an in|dulgence, that &s;hall make me &s;erviceable to MINE. It has been a good while in my head. But I cannot promi&s;e that I &s;hall &s;ucceed in it.</P>
<P>Don't ab&s;olutely de&s;pair, however, my dear. Your quarrel with Lovelace may be a help to it. And the offers you made, in your an&s;wer to your uncle Har|lowe's letter of Sunday night la&s;t, may be another.</P>
<P>I depend upon your forgivene&s;s of all the, perhaps un&s;ea&s;onable, flippancies of your naturally too lively, yet mo&s;t &s;incerely &s;ympathizing,</P>

<P>YOU have very kindly accounted for your &s;ilence. People in misfortune are always in doubt. They are too apt to turn even unavoidable accidents into &s;lights and neglects; e&s;pecially in tho&s;e who&s;e favour|able opinion they wi&s;h to pre&s;erve.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="139">I am &s;ure I ought evermore to exempt my Anna Howe from the &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ibility of her becoming one of tho&s;e who ba&s;k only in the &s;un&s;hine of a friend: But neverthele&s;s her friend&s;hip is too precious to me, not to doubt my own merits on the one hand, and not to be anxious for the pre&s;ervation of it, on the other.</P>
<P>You &s;o generou&s;ly give me liberty to chide you, that I am afraid of taking it, becau&s;e I could &s;ooner mi&s;tru&s;t my own judgment, than that of a beloved friend, who&s;e ingenuity in acknowleging an <HI>imputed</HI> error, &s;ets her above the commi&s;&s;ion of a <HI>wilful</HI> one. This makes me half afraid to a&s;k you, If you think you are not too cruel, too <HI>ungenerous</HI> &s;hall I &s;ay, in your behaviour to a man who loves you &s;o dearly, and is &s;o worthy and &s;o &s;incere a man?</P>
<P>Only it is by YOU, or I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to be outdone in that true magnanimity, which makes one thankful for the wounds given by a true friend. I believe I was guilty of a petulance, which nothing but my unea&s;y &s;ituation can excu&s;e; if <HI>that</HI> can. I am almo&s;t <HI>afraid</HI> to beg of you, and yet I repeatedly <HI>do,</HI> to give way to that charming &s;pirit, whenever it ri&s;es to your pen, which &s;miles, yet goes to the quick of one's fault. What patient &s;hall be afraid of a probe in &s;o delicate a hand?&mdash;I &s;ay, I am almo&s;t afraid to pray you to give way to it, for fear you &s;hould, for that very rea&s;on, re&s;train it. For the edge may he taken off, if it does not make the &s;ubject of its rail|lery wince a little. <HI>Permitted</HI> or <HI>de&s;ired</HI> &s;atire may be apt, in a generous &s;atiri&s;t, mending as it raillies, to turn too &s;oon into panegyric. Yours is intended to in&s;truct; and tho' it bites, it plea&s;es at the &s;ame time: No fear of a wound's rankling or fe&s;tering by &s;o delicate a point, as you carry; not invenom'd by <HI>per&s;onality,</HI> not intending to expo&s;e, or ridicule, or exa&s;perate.&mdash;The mo&s;t admired of our moderns know nothing of this art; Why? Becau&s;e it mu&s;t be founded
<PB N="138" REF="140">
in good-nature, and directed by a right heart. The <HI>man,</HI> not the <HI>fault,</HI> is the &s;ubject of <HI>their</HI> &s;atire: And were it to be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> how &s;hould it be <HI>u&s;eful?</HI> How &s;hould it an&s;wer any good purpo&s;e? When every ga&s;h (for their weapon is a Broad-&s;word, not a Lan|cet) lets in the air of public ridicule, and exa&s;perates where it &s;hould heal. Spare me not therefore, be|cau&s;e I am your <HI>friend.</HI> For <HI>that</HI> very rea&s;on &s;pare me not. I may <HI>feel</HI> your edge, fine as it is; I may be pained: You would lo&s;e your end if I were not: But after the fir&s;t &s;en&s;ibility (as I have &s;aid more than once before), I will love you the better, and my amended heart &s;hall be all yours; and it will then be more worthy to be yours.</P>
<P>You have taught me what to &s;ay to, and what to think of, Mr. Lovelace. You have, by agreeable anti|cipation, let me know how it is probable he will ap|ply to me to be excus'd. I will lay every thing before you that &s;hall pa&s;s on the occa&s;ion, if he <HI>does</HI> apply, that I may take your advice, when it can come in time; and when it cannot, that I may receive your correction, or approbation, as I may happen to merit either.&mdash;Only one thing mu&s;t be allow'd for me; that whatever cour&s;e I &s;hall be <HI>permitted</HI> or he <HI>forced</HI> to &s;teer, I mu&s;t be con&s;idered, as a per&s;on out of her own direction. To&s;t to and fro, by the high winds of pa&s;&s;ionate controul, and, as I think, unrea&s;onable &s;everity, I behold the de&s;ired Port, the <HI>&s;ingle &s;tate,</HI> which I would fain &s;teer into; but am kept off by the foaming billows of a brother's and &s;i&s;ter's envy; and by the raging winds of a &s;uppo&s;ed invaded autho|rity; while I &s;ee in Lovelace, the Rocks on one hand, and in Solmes, the Sands on the other; and tremble, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;plit upon the former, or &s;trike upon the latter.</P>
<P>But you, my better pilot, what a charming hope do you bid me a&s;pire to, if things come to extre|mity!&mdash;I will not, as you caution me, too much
<PB N="139" REF="141">
depend upon your &s;ucce&s;s with your mamma, in my favour: For well I know her high notions of impli|cit duty in a child.&mdash;But yet I will <HI>hope</HI> too;&mdash;becau&s;e her &s;ea&s;onable protection may &s;ave me perhaps from a greater ra&s;hne&s;s: And, in This ca&s;e, &s;ee &s;hall direct all my ways: I will do nothing but by her orders, and by her advice and yours: Not &s;ee any-body: Not write to any-body: Nor &s;hall any living &s;oul, but by her direction and yours, know where I am. In any cottage place me, I will never &s;tir out, unle&s;s, di&s;|gui&s;ed as your &s;ervant, I am now-and-then permitted an evening-walk with you: And this private pro|tection to be granted me for no longer time than till my cou&s;in Morden comes; which, as I hope, cannot be long.</P>
<P>I am afraid I mu&s;t not venture to take the hint you give me, to depo&s;ite &s;ome of my cloaths; altho' I will &s;ome of my linen, as well as papers.</P>
<P>I will tell you why. Betty had for &s;ome time been very curious about my wardrobe, whenever I took out any of my things before her.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving this, I once left my keys in the locks, on taking one of my garden-airings; and on my re|turn, &s;urpri&s;ed the creature with her hand upon the keys, as if &s;hutting the door.</P>
<P>She was confounded at my &s;udden coming back. I took no notice: But, on her retiring, I found my cloaths did not lie in the u&s;ual order.</P>
<P>I doubted not, upon this, that her curio&s;ity was an effect of their orders to her; and being afraid they would abridge me of my airings, if their &s;u&s;picions were not obviated, it has ever since been my custom (among other contrivances), not only to leave my keys in the locks; but to employ the wench now-and-then, in taking out my cloaths, &s;uit by &s;uit, on pretence of preventing their being rumpled or crea&s;ed, and to &s;ee that the flower'd &s;ilver &s;uit did not tarni&s;h; &s;ome|times declaredly as a wile-away-time, having little
<PB N="140" REF="142">
el&s;e to do: With which employment (&s;uper-added to the delight taken by the low as well as the high of our &s;ex in &s;eeing fine cloaths) &s;he &s;eem'd always, I thought, as well plea&s;ed, as if it an&s;wer'd one of the offices &s;he had in charge.</P>
<P>To this, and to the confidence they have in a &s;py &s;o diligent, and to their knowing, that I have not one confidante in a family, where, I believe, neverthele&s;s, every &s;ervant in it loves me; nor have attempted to make one; I &s;uppo&s;e, I owe the freedom I enjoy of my air|ings: And, perhaps (finding I make no movements towards going off), they are the more &s;ecure, that I &s;hall at la&s;t be prevailed upon to comply with their mea&s;ures: Since they mu&s;t think, that, otherwi&s;e, they give me provocations enough to take &s;ome ra&s;h &s;tep, in order to free my&s;elf from a treatment &s;o di&s;|graceful; and which (God forgive me, if I judge ami&s;s!), I am afraid my brother and &s;i&s;ter would not be &s;orry to drive me to take.</P>
<P>If therefore &s;uch a &s;tep &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary (which I yet hope will not!) I mu&s;t be contented to go away with the cloaths I &s;hall have on at the time. My cu&s;tom to be dre&s;s'd for the day, as &s;oon as break|fa&s;t is over, when I have had no hou&s;hold-employ|ments to prevent me, will make &s;uch a &s;tep, if I am forced to take it, le&s;s &s;u&s;pected. And the linen I &s;hall depo&s;ite, in pur&s;uance of your kind hint, cannot be mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom, altho' a pri&s;oner, as I may too truly &s;ay, and neither vi&s;ited nor vi&s;iting, I continue. One owes to <HI>one's-&s;elf,</HI> and to one's <HI>&s;ex,</HI> you know, to be always neat; and never to be &s;urpri&s;ed in a way one &s;hould be pained to be &s;een in.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, people in adver&s;ity, which is the &s;tate of trial of every good quality, &s;hould endeavour to pre|&s;erve laudable cu&s;toms, that, if &s;un&s;hine return, they may not be lo&s;ers by their trial.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143">Does it not, moreover, manife&s;t a firmne&s;s of mind, in an unhappy per&s;on, to keep hope alive?</P>
<P>To <HI>hope</HI> for better days, is half to <HI>de&s;erve</HI> them: For could we have ju&s;t ground for &s;uch a hope, if we did not re&s;olve to de&s;erve what that hope bids us a&s;pire to?&mdash;Then, who &s;hall befriend a per&s;on who for&s;akes her&s;elf?&mdash;The&s;e are reflections by which I &s;ometimes endeavour to &s;upport my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I know you don't de&s;pi&s;e my <HI>grave airs,</HI> altho' (with a view, no doubt, to irradiate my mind in my misfortunes) you railly me upon them. Every-body has not your talent of introducing &s;erious and import|ant le&s;&s;ons, in &s;uch a happy manner, as at once to de|light and in&s;truct.</P>
<P>What a multitude of contrivances may not young people fall upon, if the mind be not engaged by acts of kindne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion! I am not u&s;ed by my friends, of late, as I always u&s;ed their &s;ervants.</P>
<P>When I was intru&s;ted with the family-manage|ment, I always found it both generous and ju&s;t, to re|po&s;e a tru&s;t in them. Not to &s;eem to expect or de|pend upon ju&s;tice from them, is, in a manner, to bid them take opportunities, whenever they offer, to be <HI>un</HI>-ju&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes (to expatiate a little on this low, but not unu&s;eful, &s;ubject), in his more trifling &s;olicitudes, would have had a &s;orry key-keeper in me. Were I mi&s;tre&s;s of a family, I would not either take to my|&s;elf, or give to &s;ervants, the pain of keeping tho&s;e I had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect. People low in &s;tation have often minds not &s;ordid.&mdash;Nay, I have &s;ometimes thought, that, even take number for number, there are more <HI>hone&s;t low people,</HI> than <HI>hone&s;t high.</HI> In the one, hone&s;ty is their <HI>chief</HI> pride. In the other, the love of power, of grandeur, of plea&s;ure, mi&s;lead; and that love, and their ambition, induce a para|mount pride, which too often &s;wallows up the more laudable one.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="144">Many of the former would &s;corn to deceive a con|fidence. But I have &s;een, among the mo&s;t ignorant of their cla&s;s, a &s;u&s;ceptibility of re&s;entment, if their hone&s;ty has been &s;u&s;pected: And have more than once been forced to put a &s;ervant right, whom I have heard &s;ay, That, altho' &s;he valued her&s;elf upon her <HI>hone&s;ty,</HI> no ma&s;ter or mi&s;tre&s;s &s;hould &s;u&s;pect her for nothing.</P>
<P>How far has the compari&s;on I had in my head, be|tween my friends treatment of <HI>me,</HI> and my treatment of their <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> carried me! But we always allowed our&s;elves to expatiate on &s;uch &s;ubjects, whether low or high, that might tend to inlarge our minds, or mend our management, whether notional or prac|tical, and whether they re&s;pected our pre&s;ent, or might re&s;pect our probable future &s;ituations.</P>
<P>What I was principally leading to, was to tell you, how ingenious I am in my contrivances and pretences to blind my gaolere&s;s, and to take off the jealou&s;y of her principals, on my going down &s;o often into the garden and poultry-yard. People &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly treated never, I believe, want invention. Sometimes I want <HI>air,</HI> and am better the moment I am out of my cham|ber&mdash;Sometimes <HI>&s;pririts</HI>; and then my Bantams and Phea&s;ants, or the Ca&s;cade, divert me; the former, by their in&s;piriting liveline&s;s; the latter, more &s;olemnly, by its echoing da&s;hings, and hollow murmurs.&mdash;Some|times, &s;olitude is of all things my wi&s;h, and the aw|ful &s;ilence of the night, the &s;pangled element, and the ri&s;ing and &s;etting &s;un, how promotive of contem|plation!&mdash;Sometimes, when I intend nothing, and expect not letters, I am officious to take Betty with me; and at others, be&s;peak her attendance, when I know &s;he is otherwi&s;e employ'd, and cannot give it me.</P>
<P>The&s;e more capital artifices I branch out into le&s;&s;er ones, without number. Yet <HI>all</HI> have not only the face of truth, but are real truth; altho' not the prin|cipal
<PB N="143" REF="145">
motive. How prompt a thing is <HI>will!</HI> What impediments does <HI>di&s;like</HI> furni&s;h!&mdash;How &s;wiftly, thro' every difficulty, do we move with the one!&mdash;How tardily with the other!&mdash;Every trifling ob&s;truction weighing one down, as if lead were fa&s;tened to our feet!</P>

<P>I HAVE already made up my parcel of linen; my heart aked all the time I was employ'd about it; and &s;till akes, at the thoughts of its being a nece&s;&s;ary precaution.</P>
<P>When it comes to your hands, as I hope it &s;afely will, you will be plea&s;ed to open it. You will find in it two parcels &s;ealed up; one of which contains the letters you have not yet &s;een; being tho&s;e written &s;ince I left you; in the other are all the letters, and copies of letters, that have pa&s;&s;ed between you and me, &s;ince I was la&s;t with you; with &s;ome other pa|pers, on &s;ubjects &s;o much above me, that I cannot wi&s;h them to be &s;een by any-body who&s;e indulgence I am not &s;o &s;ure of, as I am of yours. If my judg|ment ripen with my years, perhaps I may review them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Norton u&s;ed to &s;ay, from her reverend Father, that there was one time of life for <HI>imagination</HI> and <HI>fancy</HI> to work in: Then, were the writer to lay by his works till <HI>riper years</HI> and <HI>experience</HI> &s;hould direct the fire rather to <HI>glow,</HI> than to <HI>flame out</HI>; &s;omething between both, might, perhaps, be produced, that would not di&s;plea&s;e a judicious eye.</P>
<P>In a third divi&s;ion, folded up &s;eparately, are all Mr. Lovelace's letters, &s;ince he was forbidden this hou&s;e, and copies of my an&s;wers to them. I expect that you will break the &s;eals of this parcel, and when you have peru&s;ed them all, give me your free opinion of my conduct.</P>
<P>By the way, not a line from that man!&mdash;Not one
<PB N="144" REF="146">
line!&mdash;Wedne&s;day I depo&s;ited mine. It remained there on Wedne&s;day night. What time it was taken away ye&s;terday I cannot tell. For I did not concern my&s;elf about it, till towards night; and then it was not there. No return at ten this day. I &s;uppo&s;e he is as much out of humour, as I. With all my heart!</P>
<P>He may be mean enough, perhaps, if ever I &s;hould put it into his <HI>power,</HI> to avenge him&s;elf for the trouble he has had with me.&mdash;But that now, I dare &s;ay, I never &s;hall.</P>
<P>I &s;ee what &s;ort of a man the incroacher is,&mdash;And I hope we are equally &s;ick of one another!&mdash;My heart is <HI>vexedly</HI>-ea&s;y, if I may &s;o de&s;cribe it. <HI>Vexedly</HI>&mdash;becau&s;e of the apprehended interview with Solmes, and the con&s;equences it may have: Or el&s;e I &s;hould be <HI>quite</HI> ea&s;y; for why? I have not <HI>de&s;erved</HI> the u&s;age I receive:&mdash;And could I be rid of Solmes, as I pre&s;ume I am of Lovelace, <HI>their</HI> influence over my father, mother, and uncles again&s;t me, could not hold.</P>
<P>The five guineas ty'd up in one corner of a hand|kerchief under the linen, I beg you will let pa&s;s, as an acknowlegement for the trouble I give your tru&s;ty &s;ervant. You mu&s;t not chide me, my dear. You know I cannot be ea&s;y, unle&s;s I have my way, in the&s;e little matters.</P>
<P>I was going to put up what little money I have, and &s;ome of my ornaments; but they are portable, and I cannot forget them. Be&s;ides, &s;hould they, &s;u&s;pecting me, de&s;ire to &s;ee any of the jewels, and were I not able to produce them, it would amount to a demon&s;tration of an intention, which would have a guilty appearance to them.</P>

<P>THE fruits of my inquiry after your abominable wretch's behaviour and ba&s;ene&s;s, at the paltry ale-hou&s;e, which he calls an inn; prepare to hear.</P>
<P>Wrens and Sparrows are not too ignoble a quarry for this villainous go&s;hawk!&mdash;His a&s;&s;iduities; his watchings; his nightly ri&s;ques; the inclement wea|ther he travels in; mu&s;t not be all placed to <HI>your</HI> account. He has opportunities of making every thing right to him of that &s;ort. A &s;weet pretty girl, I am told:&mdash;Innocent till he went thither&mdash;Now!&mdash;Ah! poor girl!&mdash;who knows what?</P>
<P>But ju&s;t turn'd of Seventeen!&mdash;His friend and bro|ther Rake; a man of humour and intrigue, as I am told, to &s;hare the &s;ocial bottle with. And &s;ometimes another di&s;gui&s;ed Rake or two. No &s;orrow comes near their hearts. Be not di&s;turbed, my dear, at his <HI>hear&s;ene&s;&s;es.</HI> His pretty Bet&s;ey, his Ro&s;e-bud, as the vile wretch calls her, can <HI>hear</HI> all he &s;ays.</P>
<P>He is very fond of her. They &s;ay &s;he is innocent even yet!&mdash;Her father, her grandmother, believe her to be &s;o. He is to fortune her out to a young lover!&mdash;Ah! the poor young lover!&mdash;Ah! the poor &s;imple girl!</P>
<P>Mr. Hickman tells me, that he heard in town, that he u&s;ed to be often at Plays, and at the Opera, with women; and every time with a different one!&mdash;Ah! my &s;weet friend!&mdash;But I hope he is nothing to you,
<PB N="146" REF="148">
if all this were truth&mdash;But this intelligence will do his bu&s;ine&s;s, if you had been ever &s;o good friends before.</P>
<P>A vile wretch! Cannot &s;uch purity in pur&s;uit, in view, re&s;train him? But I leave him to you!&mdash;There can be no hope of him. More of a fool, than of &s;uch a one. Yet I wi&s;h I may be able to &s;natch the poor young creature out of his villainous paws. I have laid a &s;cheme to do &s;o; if <HI>indeed</HI> &s;he is hitherto in|nocent and heart-free.</P>
<P>He appears to the people as a military man, in di&s;gui&s;e, &s;ecreting him&s;elf on account of a duel fought in town; the adver&s;ary's life in &s;u&s;pen&s;e. They be|lieve he is a great man. His friend pa&s;&s;es for an inferior officer; upon a foot of freedom with him: He, accompany'd by a third man, who is a &s;ort of &s;ubordinate companion to the &s;econd. The wretch him&s;elf but with one &s;ervant. O my dear! How plea&s;antly can the&s;e devils, as I mu&s;t call them, pa&s;s their time, while our gentle bo&s;oms heave with pity for their &s;uppo&s;ed &s;ufferings for us!</P>
<P>I AM ju&s;t now inform'd, that, at my de&s;ire, I &s;hall &s;ee this girl, and her father: I will &s;ift them thoroughly. I &s;hall &s;oon find out &s;uch a &s;imple thing as This, if he has not corrupted her already&mdash;And if he has, I &s;hall &s;oon find that out too.&mdash;If more Art than Na|ture in either her or her father, I &s;hall give them both up&mdash;But, depend upon it, the girl's undone.</P>
<P>He is &s;aid to be fond of her.&mdash;He places her at the upper end of his table&mdash;He &s;ets her a-pratling.&mdash;He keeps his friend at a di&s;tance from her.&mdash;She prates away.&mdash;He admires for nature all &s;he &s;ays.&mdash;Once was heard to call her charming little crea|ture!&mdash;An hundred has he called &s;o no doubt.&mdash;Puts her upon &s;inging&mdash;Prai&s;es her wild note.&mdash;O my dear, the girl's undone!&mdash;mu&s;t be undone!&mdash;The

<P>YOU incen&s;e, alarm, and terrify me, at the &s;ame time! Ha&s;ten, my deare&s;t friend, ha&s;ten to me, what further intelligence you can gather about this vile&s;t of men!</P>
<P>But never talk of innocence, of &s;implicity, and this unhappy girl together! Mu&s;t &s;he not know, that &s;uch a man as That, dignify'd in his very a&s;pect; and no di&s;gui&s;e able to conceal his being of condition&mdash;mu&s;t mean too much, when he places her at the upper end of his table, and calls her by &s;uch tender names?&mdash;Would a girl, mode&s;t as &s;imple, above Seventeen, be &s;et a &s;inging at the plea&s;ure of &s;uch a man as That?

<P><PB N="148" REF="150"><HI>Keep his friend at di&s;tance from her!</HI>&mdash;To be &s;ure his <HI>de&s;igns</HI> are villainous, if they have not been already effected.</P>
<P>Warn, my dear, if not too late, the unthinking father, of his child's danger.&mdash;There cannot be a father in the world, who would &s;ell his child's vir|tue.&mdash;No mother!&mdash;The poor thing!</P>
<P>I long to hear the re&s;ult of your intelligence.

<P>This vile Jo&s;eph Leman had given a hint to Betty, and &s;he to me, as if Lovelace would be found out

to be a very bad man, at a place where he had been lately &s;een in di&s;gui&s;e.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Friday Noon, March 31.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>JUSTICE obliges me to forward This after my la&s;t, on the wings of the wind, as I may &s;ay.&mdash;I really believe the man is innocent. Of this <HI>one</HI> accu&s;ation, I think, he mu&s;t be acquitted; and I am &s;orry I was &s;o forward in di&s;patching away my intelligence by halves.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the girl. She is really a very pretty, a very neat, and what is &s;till a greater beauty, a very innocent young creature. He who could have ruin'd &s;uch an unde&s;igning home-bred, mu&s;t have been in|deed
<PB N="150" REF="152">
infernally wicked. Her father is an hone&s;t &s;im|ple man; intirely &s;atisfy'd with his child, and with her new acquaintance.</P>
<P>I am almo&s;t afraid for your heart, when I tell you, that I find, now I have got to the bottom of this in|quiry, &s;omething noble come out in this Lovelace's favour.</P>
<P>The girl is to be marry'd next week; and This promoted and brought about by him. He is re&s;olv'd, her father &s;ays, to make one couple happy, and wi&s;hes he could make more &s;o. [There's for you, my dear!] And having taken a liking al&s;o to the young fellow whom &s;he profe&s;&s;es to love, he has given her an hundred pounds: The grandmother actually has it in her hands, to an&s;wer to the like &s;um, given to the youth by one of his own relations: While Mr. Lovelace's companion, attracted by the example, has pre&s;ented twenty-five guineas to the father, who is poor, towards cloaths to equip the pretty Ru&s;tic.</P>
<P>They were de&s;irous, the poor man &s;ays, when they fir&s;t came, of appearing beneath them&s;elves; but now he knows the one (but mention'd it in confidence) to be Colonel Barrow, the other Capt. Sloane. The Colonel he owns, was at fir&s;t, very <HI>&s;weet upon his girl:</HI> But upon her grandmother's begging of him to &s;pare her innocence, he vow'd, that he never would offer any thing but good coun&s;el to her; and had kept to his word: And the pretty fool acknowleged, that &s;he never could have been better in&s;tructed by the mi|ni&s;ter him&s;elf from the <HI>Bible-Book!</HI>&mdash;The girl, I own, plea&s;ed me &s;o well, that I made her vi&s;it to me worth her while.</P>
<P>But what, my dear, will become of us now?&mdash;Lovelace not only reform'd, but turn'd preacher!&mdash;What will become of us now?&mdash;Why, my &s;weet friend, your <HI>genero&s;ity</HI> is now engaged in his fa|vour!&mdash;Fie, upon this <HI>Genero&s;ity!</HI>&mdash;I think in my heart, that it does as much mi&s;chief to the noble-minded,
<PB N="151" REF="153">
as <HI>Love</HI> to the ignobler.&mdash;What before was only a <HI>conditional liking,</HI> I am now afraid will turn to <HI>liking unconditional.</HI></P>
<P>I could not endure to turn my invective into pa|negyric all at once, and &s;o &s;oon. We, or &s;uch as I, at lea&s;t, love to keep our&s;elves in countenance for a ra&s;h judgment, even when we know it to be ra&s;h. Every-body has not your genero&s;ity in confe&s;&s;ing a mi&s;take. It requires a greatne&s;s of &s;oul to do it. So I made &s;till farther inquiry after his life and manners, and behaviour there, in hopes to find &s;omething bad: But all uniform!</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, Mr. Lovelace comes out with &s;o much advantage from this inquiry, that were there the lea&s;t room for it, I &s;hould &s;u&s;pect the whole to be a plot &s;et on foot to wa&s;h a blackmoor white. Adieu, my dear.</P>

<P>HASTY cen&s;urers do indeed &s;ubject them&s;elves to the charge of variablene&s;s and incon&s;i&s;tency in judgment: And &s;o they ought; for, if you, even you, were really &s;o loth to own a mi&s;take, as, in the in&s;tance before us, you pretend to &s;ay you were, I believe I &s;hould not have loved you &s;o well as I really do love you. Nor could you, my dear, have &s;o frankly thrown the reflection I hint at, upon your&s;elf, had you not had one of the mo&s;t ingenuous minds that ever woman boa&s;ted.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace has faults enow to de&s;erve very &s;evere cen&s;ure, altho' he be not guilty of this. If I were upon &s;uch terms with him, as he would wi&s;h me to be, I &s;hould give him a hint, that this treacherous
<PB N="152" REF="154">
Jo&s;eph Leman cannot be &s;o much his friend, as per|haps he thinks him. If he had, he would not have been &s;o ready to report to his di&s;advantage (and to Betty Barnes too) this &s;light affair of the pretty Ru&s;tic. Jo&s;eph has engaged Betty to &s;ecrecy; promi&s;ing to let her, and her young ma&s;ter too, know more, when he knows the whole of the matter: And this hinders her from mentioning it, as &s;he is neverthele&s;s agog to do, to my &s;i&s;ter or my brother. And then &s;he does not choo&s;e to di&s;oblige Jo&s;eph; for altho' &s;he pretends to look above him, &s;he li&s;tens, I believe, to &s;ome love-&s;tories he tells her. Women having it not in their power to <HI>begin</HI> a court&s;hip, &s;ome of them very frequently, I believe, lend an <HI>ear</HI> where their <HI>hearts</HI> incline not.</P>
<P>But to &s;ay no more of the&s;e low people, neither of whom I think tolerably of; I mu&s;t needs own, that as I &s;hould for ever have de&s;pi&s;ed this man, had he been capable of &s;uch a vile intrigue in his way to Har|lowe-place; and as I believed he <HI>was</HI> capable of it, it has indeed engaged my <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> as you call it, in proportion (&mdash;I <HI>own</HI> it has&mdash;) in his favour: Perhaps more than I may have rea&s;on to wi&s;h it had. And, railly me, as you will, pray tell me fairly, my dear, would it not have had &s;uch an effect upon you?</P>
<P>Then the real genero&s;ity of the act.&mdash;I prote&s;t, my beloved friend, if he would be good for the re&s;t of his life from this time, I would forgive him a great many of his pa&s;t errors, were it only for the demon&s;tration he has given in This, that he is <HI>capable</HI> of &s;o good and bountiful a manner of thinking.</P>
<P>You may believe I made no &s;cruple to open his letter, after the receipt of your &s;econd on this &s;ubject: Nor &s;hall I of an&s;wering it, as I have no rea&s;on to find fault with it: An article in his favour, procured him, however, &s;o much the ea&s;ier (as I mu&s;t own) by way of amends for the undue di&s;plea&s;ure I took again&s;t him; tho' he knows it not.</P>
<P>It is lucky enough that this matter was cleared up
<PB N="153" REF="155">
to me by your friendly diligence &s;o &s;oon: For had I wrote at all before that, it would have been to reinforce my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of him; and perhaps the very motive mentioned; for it had affected me more than I think it ought: And then, what an advantage would that have given him, when he could have clear'd up the matter &s;o happily for him&s;elf?</P>
<P>When I &s;end you This letter of his, you will &s;ee how very humble he is: What acknowlegements of natural impatience: What confe&s;&s;ion of faults, as you progno&s;ticated. A very different appearance, I mu&s;t own, all the&s;e make, now the &s;tory of the pretty Ru&s;tic is clear'd up, than they would have made, had it not.&mdash;And, methinks too, my dear, I can allow the girl to be prettier than before I could, tho' I ne|ver &s;aw her&mdash;For <HI>Virtue</HI> is Beauty in perfection.</P>
<P>You will &s;ee how he accounts to me, thro' indi&s;|po&s;ition,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'that he could not come for my letter in per&s;on; and he labours the point, as if he thought I &s;hould be unea&s;y that he did not.'</Q>
I am &s;orry he &s;hould be ill on my account; and I will allow, that the &s;u&s;pen&s;e he has been in, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, mu&s;t have been vexatious enough to &s;o impatient a &s;pirit. But all is owing originally to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>You will find him (in the pre&s;umption of being forgiven)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'full of contrivances and expedients for my e&s;caping the compul&s;ion threatened me.'</Q></P>
<P>I have always &s;aid, that next to being without fault, is the acknowlegement of a fault; &s;ince no amend|ment can be expected, where an error is defended: But you will &s;ee, in this very letter, an haughtine&s;s even in his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions. 'Tis true, I know not where to find fault, as to the expre&s;&s;ion, yet cannot I be &s;atisfy'd, that his humility <HI>is</HI> humility; or even an humility upon &s;uch conviction as one &s;hould be plea&s;ed with.</P>
<P>To be &s;ure, he is far from being a polite man: Yet is he not directly and characteri&s;tically <HI>un</HI>-polite.
<PB N="154" REF="156">
But <HI>his</HI> is &s;uch a &s;ort of politene&s;s, as has, by a care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s founded on a very early indulgence, and per|haps on too much &s;ucce&s;s in riper years, and an arro|gance built upon both, grown into a&s;&s;uredne&s;s, and, of cour&s;e, as I may &s;ay, into indelicacy.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance you recommend, at which to keep this &s;ex, is certainly right in the main: Familiarity de&s;troys reverence: But with whom?&mdash;Not with tho&s;e, &s;urely, who are prudent, grateful, and gene|rous.</P>
<P>But it is very difficult for per&s;ons, who would avoid running into one extreme, to keep clear of another. Hence Mr. Lovelace, perhaps, thinks it the mark of a great &s;pirit to humour his pride, tho' at the expence of delicacy: But can the man be a deep man, who knows not how to make &s;uch di&s;tinctions, as a per|&s;on of moderate parts cannot mi&s;s?</P>
<P>He complains heavily of my
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'readine&s;s to take mor|tal offence at him, and to di&s;mi&s;s him for ever: It is a <HI>high</HI> conduct, he &s;ays he mu&s;t be &s;incere enough to tell me; and what mu&s;t be very far from contri|buting to allay his apprehen&s;ions of the po&s;&s;ibility that I may be per&s;ecuted into my relations mea&s;ures in behalf of Mr. Solmes.'</Q></P>
<P>You will &s;ee how he puts his pre&s;ent and his future happine&s;s,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'with regard to both worlds, intirely up|on me.'</Q>
The ardour with which he vows and pro|mi&s;es, I think the heart only can dictate: How el&s;e can any one gue&s;s at a man's heart?</P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I leave it to him to judge, whether <HI>his</HI> be a wor|thy one, try'd by this rule: And whether, know|ing the impetuo&s;ity of his di&s;po&s;ition; and the im|probability there is, that my family will ever be re|conciled to him, I ought to encourage his hopes?</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That the&s;e &s;pots and blemi&s;hes give me not ear|ne&s;tne&s;s enough for any &s;ake but <HI>his own,</HI> to wi&s;h him in a ju&s;ter and nobler train of thinking and acting; for that I truly de&s;pi&s;e many of the ways he allows him&s;elf in: Our minds are therefore infinitely dif|ferent: And as to his profe&s;&s;ions of reformation, I mu&s;t tell him, that profu&s;e acknowlegements, with|out amendment, are but to me as &s;o many &s;top- mouth conce&s;&s;ions, which he may find much ea&s;ier to make, than either to defend him&s;elf, or amend his errors.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I have been lately made acquainted [And &s;o I have by Betty, and &s;he by my brother] with the fooli&s;h liberty he gives him&s;elf of declaiming again&s;t matrimony. I &s;everely reprehend him on this occa&s;ion: And a&s;k him, with what view he can take &s;o witle&s;s, &s;o de&s;picable a liberty, worthy only of the mo&s;t abandon'd, and yet pre&s;ume to addre&s;s <HI>me?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I tell him, That if I am obliged to go to my uncle Antony's, it is not to be inferr'd, that I mu&s;t therefore <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> be Mr. Solmes's wife: Since I may not be &s;o &s;ure, perhaps, that the &s;ame ex|ceptions lie &s;o &s;strongly again&s;t my quitting a hou&s;e to which I &s;hall be forcibly carry'd, as if I left my

<P>This, I doubt, is &s;omewhat of an artifice; being principally de&s;ign'd to keep him out of mi&s;chief. For I have but little hope, if carry'd thither, whe|ther &s;en&s;ible or &s;en&s;ele&s;s, if I am left to my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's mercy, but they will endeavour to force the &s;olemn obligation upon me. Otherwi&s;e, were there but any pro&s;pect of avoiding this, by delaying (or even by taking things to make me ill, if nothing el&s;e would do) till my cou&s;in comes, I hope I &s;hould not think of leaving even my uncle's hou&s;e. For I &s;hould not know how to &s;quare it to my own principles, to di&s;pen&s;e with the duty I owe to my father, where|ever it &s;hall be his will to place me.</P>
<P>But while you give me the charming hope, that, in order to avoid one man, I &s;hall not be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of throwing my&s;elf upon the friends of the other; I think my ca&s;e not ab&s;olutely de&s;perate.</P>
<P>I &s;ee not any of my family, nor hear from them in any way of kindne&s;s. This looks, as if they them|&s;elves expected no great matters from that Tue&s;day's conference which makes my heart flutter every-time I think of it.</P>
<P>My uncle Antony's intended pre&s;ence I do not much like: But That is preferable to my brother's or &s;i&s;ter's. My uncle is very impetuous in his anger. I can't think Mr. Lovelace can be much more &s;o; at lea&s;t, he cannot <HI>look it,</HI> as my uncle, with his harder features, can. The&s;e &s;ea-pro&s;per'd gentlemen, as my uncle has often made me think, net u&s;ed to any but elemental controul, and even ready to buffet That; blu&s;ter often as violently as the winds they are ac|cu&s;tomed to be angry at.</P>
<P>I believe both Mr. Solmes and I &s;hall look like a couple of fools, if it be true, as my uncle Harlowe
<PB N="158" REF="160">
writes, and Betty often tells me, that he is as much afraid of &s;eeing me, as I am of &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>Adieu, my happy, thrice happy, Mi&s;s Howe, who have no hard terms affixed to your duty!&mdash;Who have nothing to do, but to fall in with a choice your mamma has made for you, to which you have not, nor can have, a ju&s;t objection: Except the froward|ne&s;s of &s;ex, as our free cen&s;urers would perhaps take the liberty to &s;ay, makes it one, that the choice was your mamma's, at fir&s;t hand.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday, April 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Ought ye&s;terday to have acknowleged the receipt of your parcel: Robin tells me, that the Jo&s;eph Leman whom you mention as the traitor, &s;aw him. He was in the poultry-yard, and &s;poke to Robin over the bank which divides that from the Green-Lane. What brings you hither, Mr. Robert?&mdash;But I can tell. Hie away, as fa&s;t as you can.</P>
<P>No doubt but their dependence upon this fellow's vigilance, and upon Betty's, leaves you more at li|berty in your airings, than you would otherwi&s;e be: But you are the only per&s;on I ever heard of, who, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, had not &s;ome faithful &s;ervant, to
<PB N="159" REF="161">
tru&s;t little offices to. A poet, my dear, would not have gone to work for an Angelica, without giving her her Violetta, her Cleanthe, her Clelia, or &s;ome &s;uch pretty-nam'd confidante.&mdash;An old nur&s;e at the least.</P>
<P>I read to my mamma &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of your let|ters. But your la&s;t paragraph, in your ye&s;terday's, charm'd her quite. You have won her heart by it, &s;he told me. And while her fit of gratitude for it la&s;ted, I was thinking to open my propo&s;al, and to pre&s;s it with all the earne&s;tne&s;s I could give it, when Hickman came in, making his legs, and &s;troking his cravat and ruffles in turn.</P>
<P>I could mo&s;t freely have ruffled him for it.&mdash;As it was&mdash;Sir&mdash;&s;aw you not &s;ome one of the &s;ervants?&mdash;Could not one of them have come in before you?</P>
<P>He begg'd pardon: Looked as if he knew not whe|ther he had be&s;t keep his ground, or withdraw:&mdash;Till my mamma. Why, Nancy, we are not upon par|ticulars.&mdash;Pray, Mr. Hickman, &s;it down.</P>
<P>By your le&mdash;ave, good madam, to me.&mdash;You know his drawl, when his mu&s;cles give him the re|&s;pectful he&s;itation&mdash;</P>
<P>Ay, ay, pray &s;it down, hone&s;t man, if you are weary!&mdash;But by my <HI>mamma,</HI> if you plea&s;e. I de&s;ire my hoop may have its full circumference. All they're good for, that I know, is to clean dirty &s;hoes, and to keep ill-manner'd fellows at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Strange girl! cry'd my mamma, di&s;plea&s;ed; but with a milder turn, Ay, ay, Mr. Hickman, &s;it down by <HI>me.</HI> I have no &s;uch <HI>forbidding folly</HI> in my dre&s;s.&mdash;I looked &s;erious; and in my heart was glad this &s;peech of hers was not made to your uncle Antony.</P>
<P>My mamma, with the true widow's freedom, would mighty prudently have led into our &s;ubject, and have had him &s;ee, I que&s;tion not, that very paragraph in your letter, which is &s;o much in his favour. He was highly
<PB N="160" REF="162">
obliged to dear Mi&s;s Harlowe, &s;he would a&s;&s;ure him; that &s;he <HI>did</HI> &s;ay&mdash;</P>
<P>But I a&s;ked him, If he had any news by his la&s;t letters from London: A que&s;tion he always under|&s;tands to be a <HI>&s;ubject-changer</HI>; for otherwi&s;e I never put it. And &s;o if he be <HI>but</HI> &s;ilent, I am not angry with him, that he an&s;wers it not.</P>
<P>I choo&s;e not to mention my propo&s;al before him, till I know how it will be reli&s;h'd by my mamma. If it be not well received, perhaps I may employ <HI>him</HI> on the occa&s;ion. Yet I don't like to owe him an obligation, if I could help it. For men who have his views in their heads, do &s;o parade it, &s;o &s;strut about, if a woman conde&s;cend to employ them in her affairs, that one has no patience with them. But if I <HI>find</HI> not an opportunity this day, I will <HI>make</HI> one to-morrow.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not open either of your &s;ealed-up parcels, but in <HI>your</HI> pre&s;ence. There is no need. Your con|duct is out of all que&s;tion with me: And by the ex|tracts you have given me from his letters and your own, I know all that relates to the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things between you.</P>
<P>I was going to give you a little flippant hint or two. But &s;ince you wi&s;h to be thought &s;uperior to all our &s;ex, in the command of your&s;elf; and &s;ince indeed you de&s;erve to be &s;o thought; I will &s;pare you.&mdash;You are, however, at times, more than half inclin'd to &s;peak out. That you do not, is only owing to a little ba&s;hful &s;truggle between <HI>you</HI> and <HI>your&s;elf,</HI> as I may &s;ay. When that is quite got over, I know you will favour me undi&s;|gui&s;edly with the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>I cannot forgive your taking upon you (at &s;o extra|vagant a rate too) to pay my mamma's &s;ervant. In|deed I <HI>am,</HI> and I <HI>will be,</HI> angry with you for it. A year's wages at once well nigh (only as, unknown to my mamma, I make it better for the &s;ervants, accord|ing
<PB N="161" REF="163">
to their merits)!&mdash;How it made the man &s;tare!&mdash;And it may be his ruin too, as far as I know. If he &s;hould buy a ring, and marry a &s;orry body in the neighbourhood with the money, one would be loth, a twelvemonth hence, that the poor old fellow &s;hould think he had rea&s;on to wi&s;h the bounty never conferr'd!</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> MUST <HI>give you your way in the&s;e things,</HI> you &s;ay.&mdash;And I know there is no contradicting you: For you were ever putting too great a value upon little offices done for <HI>you,</HI> and too little upon the great ones you do for <HI>others.</HI> The &s;atisfaction you have in doing &s;o, I grant it, repays you. But why &s;hould you, by the noblene&s;s of your mind, throw reproaches upon the re&s;t of the world?&mdash;Particularly, upon your own family, and upon ours too?</P>
<P>If, as I have heard you &s;ay, it is a good rule to <HI>give</HI> WORDS <HI>the hearing, but to form our judgments of men and things by</HI> DEEDS ONLY; what &s;hall we think of one, who &s;eeks to find palliatives in <HI>words,</HI> for nar|rowne&s;s of heart in the very per&s;ons her <HI>deeds</HI> &s;o &s;ilently, yet &s;o forcibly, reflect upon? Why blu&s;h you not, my dear friend, to be thus &s;ingular?&mdash;When you meet with another per&s;on, who&s;e mind is like your own, then di&s;play your excellencies as you plea&s;e: But till then, for pity's &s;ake, let your heart and your &s;pirit &s;uffer a little contraction.</P>
<P>I intended to write but a few lines; chiefly to let you know, your parcels are come &s;afe. And accordingly I began in a large hand; and I am al|ready come to the end of my &s;econd &s;heet. But I could write a quire without he&s;itation, upon a &s;ubject &s;o copious, and &s;o beloved, as is your prai&s;e.&mdash;Not for <HI>this</HI> &s;ingle in&s;tance of your genero&s;ity; &s;ince I am really angry with you for it; but for the benevo|lence exemplified in the whole tenor of your life and actions; of which This is but a common in&s;tance.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday Night, April 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have many new particulars to acquaint you with, that &s;hew a great change in my friends behaviour to me. I did not think we had &s;o much art among us, as I find we have. I will give them to you as they offer'd.</P>
<P>All the family was at church in the morning. They brought good Dr. Lewin with them, in pur&s;uance of a previous invitation. And the doctor &s;ent up to de&s;ire my permi&s;&s;ion to attend me in my own apartment.</P>
<P>You may believe it was ea&s;ily granted.</P>
<P>So the doctor came up.</P>
<P>We had a conver&s;ation of near an hour before din|ner: But, to my &s;urprize, he waved every thing that would have led to the &s;ubject I &s;uppo&s;ed he wanted to talk about. At la&s;t, I a&s;ked him, If it were not thought &s;trange I &s;hould be &s;o long ab&s;ent from church? He made me &s;ome hand&s;ome compliments upon it: But &s;aid, For his part, he had ever made it a rule, to avoid interfering in the private concerns of families, unle&s;s de&s;ired to do &s;o.</P>
<P>I was prodigiou&s;ly di&s;appointed: But &s;uppo&s;ing that he was thought too ju&s;t a man to be made a judge of in this cau&s;e; I led no more to it: Nor, when he was called to dinner, did he take the lea&s;t notice of leaving me behind him there.</P>
<P>But this was the fir&s;t time, &s;ince my confinement, that I thought it a hard&s;hip not to dine below. And when I parted with him on the &s;tairs, a tear would bur&s;t
<PB N="163" REF="165">
its way; and he hurried down; his own good-natured eyes gli&s;tening; for he &s;aw it.&mdash;Nor tru&s;ted he his voice, le&s;t the accent, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;hould have di&s;co|ver'd his concern; departing in &s;ilence; tho' with his u&s;ual graceful obligingne&s;s.</P>
<P>I hear, that he prai&s;ed me, and my part in the conver&s;ation we had held together.&mdash;To &s;hew them, I &s;uppo&s;e, that it was not upon the intere&s;ting &s;ub|jects which I make no doubt he was de&s;ired not to enter upon.</P>
<P>He left me &s;o di&s;&s;atisfy'd, yet &s;o perplexed with this new way of treatment, that I never found my|&s;elf &s;o puzzled, and &s;o much out of my train.</P>
<P>But I was to be more &s;o. This was to be a day of puzzle to me. <HI>Pregnant</HI> puzzle, if I may &s;o &s;ay:&mdash;For there mu&s;t great meaning lie behind it.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, all but my brother and &s;i&s;ter went to church with the good doctor; who left his com|pliments for me. I took a walk in the garden: My brother and &s;i&s;ter walked in it too, and kept me in their eye a good while, on purpo&s;e, as I thought, that I might &s;ee how gay and good-humour'd they were together. At la&s;t they came down the walk that I was coming up, hand-in-hand, lover-like.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Mi&s;s&mdash;Your &s;ervant, Sir&mdash;pa&s;&s;ed between my brother and me.</P>
<P>Is it not cold-i&s;h, &s;i&s;ter Clary? in a kinder voice than u&s;ual, &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter, and &s;topp'd.&mdash;I &s;topp'd, and courte&s;y'd low to her half-courte&s;y.&mdash;I think not, &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>She went on. I courte&s;y'd without return; and proceeded; turning to my poultry-yard.</P>
<P>By a &s;horter turn, arm-in-arm, they were there before me.</P>
<P>I think, Clary, &s;aid my brother, you mu&s;t pre&s;ent me with &s;ome of this breed, for Scotland.</P>
<P>If you plea&s;e, brother.</P>
<P>I'll choo&s;e for you, &s;aid my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166">And while I fed them, they picked out half a dozen: Yet intending nothing by it, I believe, but to &s;hew a deal of love and good-humour to each other, before me.</P>
<P>My uncles next (after church was done, to &s;peak in the common phra&s;e) were to do me the honour of <HI>their</HI> notice. They bid Betty tell me, they would drink tea with me in my own apartment. Now, thought I, &s;hall I have the &s;ubject of next Tue&s;day in|forced upon me.</P>
<P>But they contradicted the tea-orders, and only my uncle Harlowe came up to me.</P>
<P>Half-di&s;tant, half-affectionate, was the air he put on to his <HI>daughter-niece,</HI> as he u&s;ed to call me; and I threw my&s;elf at his feet, and be&s;ought his favour.</P>
<P>None of the&s;e di&s;compo&s;ures, child! None of the&s;e apprehen&s;ions! You'll now have every-body's favour! All is coming about, my dear!&mdash;I was impatient to &s;ee you!&mdash;I could no longer deny my&s;elf this &s;atis|faction. And rai&s;ed me, and ki&s;&s;ed me, and called me, Charming creature!</P>
<P>But he waved entering into any intere&s;ting &s;ubject. All will be well now! All will be right!&mdash;No more complainings! Every-body loves you!&mdash;I only came to make my earlie&s;t court to you, were his conde|&s;cending words, and to &s;it and talk of twenty and twenty fond things, as I u&s;ed to do.&mdash;And let every pa&s;t di&s;agreeable thing be forgotten; as if nothing had happen'd.</P>
<P>He under&s;tood me as beginning to hint at the di&s;|grace of my confinement.&mdash;No di&s;grace, my dear, can fall to your lot: Your reputation is too well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.&mdash;I long'd to &s;ee you, repeated he.&mdash;I have &s;een no-body half &s;o amiable, &s;ince I &s;aw you la&s;t.</P>
<P>And again he ki&s;&s;ed my cheek, my glowing cheek, for I was impatient, I was vexed, to be thus, as I thought, play'd upon: And how could I be grateful for a vi&s;it, that, it now was evident, was only a too
<PB N="165" REF="167">
<HI>humble</HI> artifice, to draw me in again&s;t the next Tue&s;|day, or to leave me inexcu&s;able to them all!</P>
<P>O my cunning brother!&mdash;This is his contrivance! And then my anger made me recollect the triumph in his and my &s;i&s;ter's loves to each other, acted before me; and the mingled indignation fla&s;hing from their eyes, as, arm in arm, they &s;poke to me, and the forced conde&s;cen&s;ion playing upon their lips, when they called me Clary, and Si&s;ter.</P>
<P>Do you think I could, with the&s;e reflections, look upon my uncle Harlowe's vi&s;it as the favour he &s;eem'd de&s;irous I &s;hould think it to be?&mdash;Indeed I could not; and &s;eeing him &s;o &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid all recrimination, as I may call it, I gave into the affectation; and fol|lowed him in his talk of indifferent things:&mdash;While he &s;eemed to admire This thing and That, as if he had never &s;een them before; and now and then, conde&s;cend|ingly ki&s;&s;ed the hand that wrought &s;ome of the things he fixed his eyes upon; not &s;o much to admire them, as to find &s;ubjects to divert what was mo&s;t in his head, and in my own heart.</P>
<P>At his going away&mdash;How can I leave you here by your&s;elf, my dear?&mdash;You, who&s;e company u&s;ed to enliven us all.&mdash;You are not expected down indeed! But I prote&s;t, I had a good mind to &s;urpri&s;e your papa and mamma!&mdash;If I thought nothing would ari&s;e, that would be di&s;agreeable&mdash;My dear, my love! [O the dear artful gentleman! how could my uncle Harlowe &s;o di&s;&s;emble?] What &s;ay you?&mdash;Will you give me your hand?&mdash;Will you &s;ee your father?&mdash;Can you &s;tand his fir&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, on &s;eeing the dear creature who has given him and all of us &s;o much di&s;|turbance?&mdash;Can you promi&s;e future&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;aw me ri&s;ing in my temper&mdash;Nay, my dear, if you cannot be all re&s;ignation, I would not have you think of it!</P>
<P>My heart, &s;truggling between duty and warmth of temper, was full. You know, my dear, I never could
<PB N="166" REF="168">
bear to be dealt meanly with!&mdash;How,&mdash;how <HI>can</HI> you, Sir!&mdash;You, my papa-uncle!&mdash;How <HI>can</HI> you, Sir!&mdash;The poor girl!&mdash;For I could not &s;peak with connexion.</P>
<P>Nay, my dear, if you cannot be all duty, all re|&s;ignation&mdash;better &s;tay where you are.&mdash;But after the in&s;tance you have given&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>In&s;tance, I have given!</HI>&mdash;What in&s;tance, Sir?</P>
<P>Well, well, child, better &s;tay where you are, if your pa&s;t confinement hangs &s;o heavy upon you&mdash;But now there will be a &s;udden end to it.&mdash;Adieu, my dear!&mdash;Three words only&mdash;Let your compliance be &s;incere!&mdash;And love me, as you u&s;ed to love me&mdash;Your grandfather did not do &s;o much for you, as I will do for you.</P>
<P>Without &s;uffering me to reply, he hurry'd away, I thought, as if he had an e&s;cape, and was glad his part was over.</P>
<P>Don't you &s;ee, my dear, how they are all deter|min'd?&mdash;Have I not rea&s;on to dread next Tue&s;day?</P>
<P>Up pre&s;ently after came my &s;i&s;ter:&mdash;To ob&s;erve, I &s;uppo&s;e, the way I was in&mdash;She found me in tears.</P>
<P>Have you not a Thomas &agrave; Kempis, &s;i&s;ter? with a &s;tiff air.</P>
<P>I have, Madam.</P>
<P><HI>Madam!</HI> How long are we to be at this di&s;tance, Clary?</P>
<P><HI>No</HI> longer, if you allow me to call you, &s;i&s;ter, my dear Bella! And I took her hand.</P>
<P>No fawning neither, girl!</P>
<P>I withdrew my hand as ha&s;tily, as I &s;hould do, if, reaching at a parcel from under the wood, I had been bit by a &s;corpion.</P>
<P>I beg pardon.&mdash;Too, too ready to make advances, I am always &s;ubjecting my&s;elf to contempts!</P>
<P>People who know not how to keep a middle be|haviour, &s;aid &s;he, mu&s;t ever-more do &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169">I will fetch you the Kempis&mdash;I did&mdash;Here it is.&mdash;You will find excellent things, Bella, in that little book.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, retorted &s;he, you had profited by them.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h <HI>you</HI> may, &s;aid I. Example from a &s;i&s;ter older than one's &s;elf is a fine thing.</P>
<P>Older! Saucy little fool!&mdash;And away &s;he flung.</P>
<P>What a captious old woman will my &s;i&s;ter make, if &s;he lives to be one!&mdash;Demanding the reverence; yet not aiming at the merit; and a&s;ham'd of the years, that only can intitle her to the reverence.</P>
<P>It is plain from what I have <HI>related,</HI> that they think they have got me at &s;ome advantage, by obtaining my con&s;ent to this interview: But if it were <HI>not,</HI> Betty's impertinence ju&s;t now would make it more evident. She has been complimenting me upon it; and upon the vi&s;it of my uncle Harlowe. She &s;ays, the difficulty now is more than half over with me. She is &s;ure I would not &s;ee Mr. Solmes, but to have him. Now &s;hall &s;he be &s;oon better imploy'd than of late &s;he has been. All hands will be at work. She loves dearly to have weddings go forward!&mdash;Who knows who&s;e turn will be next?</P>
<P>I found in the afternoon a reply to my an&s;wer to Mr. Lovelace's letter: It is full of promi&s;es, full of gratitude, of <HI>eternal</HI> gratitude, is his word, among others &s;till more hyperbolic. Yet Mr. Lovelace, the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of any man who&s;e letters I have &s;een, runs into tho&s;e elevated ab&s;urdities. I &s;hould be apt to de&s;pi&s;e him for it, if he did. Such language looks always to me, as if the flatterer thought to <HI>find</HI> a woman a fool, or hop'd to <HI>make</HI> her one.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He regrets my indifference to him; which puts all the hope he has in my &s;avour, upon my friends &s;hocking u&s;age of me.</Q></P>

<PB N="168" REF="170">
he has too much ingenuity to attempt to do so: Yet is &s;truck dumb by my har&s;h con&s;truction, that his acknowleging temper is owing more to his care|le&s;ne&s;s to defend him&s;elf, than to his inclination to amend. He had never <HI>before</HI> met with the ob|jections again&s;t his morals which I had rai&s;ed, <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> rai&s;ed. And he was re&s;olved to obviate them.

<P>I Am glad my papers are &s;afe in your hands. I will make it my endeavour to de&s;erve your good opi|nion, that I may not at once di&s;grace your judgment, and my own heart.</P>
<P>I have another letter from Mr. Lovelace. He is extremely apprehen&s;ive of the meeting I am to have with Mr. Solmes to-morrow. He &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That the airs that wretch gives him&s;elf on the occa&s;ion, add to his concern; and it is with infinite difficulty that he prevails upon him&s;elf, not to make him a vi&s;it, to let him know what he may expect, if compul&s;ion be u&s;ed towards me in his favour. He a&s;&s;ures me, That Solmes has actually talked with trade&s;men of new equipages, and names the people in town, with whom he has treated: That he has even (Was there ever &s;uch a horrid wretch!) allotted This and That apartment in his hou&s;e, for a nur&s;ery, and other offices.'</Q></P>

<P>I HAVE had a vi&s;it from my aunt Hervey. Betty, in her alarming way, told me, I &s;hould have a Lady to breakfa&s;t with me, whom I little expected; giving me to believe it was my mamma. This flutter'd me &s;o much, on hearing a Lady coming up-&s;tairs, &s;up|po&s;ing it was &s;he (not knowing how to account for her motives in &s;uch a vi&s;it, after I had been &s;o long bani&s;h'd from her pre&s;ence) that my aunt, at her en|trance,
<PB N="173" REF="175">
took notice of my di&s;order, and after the fir&s;t &s;alutation,</P>
<P>Why, Mi&s;s &s;aid &s;he, you &s;eem &s;urpriz'd!&mdash;Upon my word, you thoughtful young Ladies have &s;trange apprehen&s;ions about nothing at all. What, taking my hand, can be the matter with you?&mdash;Why, my dear, tremble, tremble, tremble at this rate? You'll be fit to be &s;een by no-body. Come, my love, ki&s;&s;ing my cheek, pluck up a courage! By this need|le&s;s flutter on the approaching interview, when it is over, you will judge of your other antipathies, and laugh at your&s;elf for giving way to &s;o apprehen&s;ive an imagination.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, that whatever we &s;trongly imagin'd, was, in its effects at the time, <HI>more</HI> than imaginary, altho' to others it might not appear &s;o: That I had not re&s;ted one hour all night: That the impertinent &s;et over me had flutter'd me, with giving me room to think, that it was my mamma who was coming up to me: And that, at this rate, I &s;hould be very little qualify'd to &s;ee any-body I di&s;liked to &s;ee.</P>
<P>There was no accounting for the&s;e things, &s;he &s;aid. Mr. Solmes la&s;t night &s;uppos'd he &s;hould be under as much agitation as I.</P>
<P>Who is it, then, Madam, that &s;o reluctant an in|terview on both &s;ides, is to plea&s;e?</P>
<P>Both of you, my dear, I hope, after the fir&s;t flurries are over. The mo&s;t apprehen&s;ive beginnings, I have often known, make the happie&s;t conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>There can be but one happy conclu&s;ion to the in|tended vi&s;it, and that is, That both &s;ides may be &s;a|tisfy'd it will be the la&s;t.</P>
<P>She then repre&s;ented, how unhappy it would be for me, if I did not &s;uffer my&s;elf to be prevailed upon: She pre&s;&s;ed me to receive him as became my edu|cation: And declar'd, that his apprehen&s;ions at &s;ee|ing me, were owing to his love and his awe; inti|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting, that true love was be&s;t known by fear, and
<PB N="174" REF="176">
reverence; and that no blu&s;tering, braving lover could de&s;erve encouragement.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wered, That con&s;titution was a great deal to be con&s;idered: That a man of &s;pirit would act like one, and could do nothing meanly: That a creep|ing mind would creep in every-thing, where it had a view to obtain a benefit by it; and in&s;ult, where it had power, and nothing to expect:&mdash;That this was not a point now to be determin'd with me: That I had &s;aid as much as I could po&s;&s;ibly &s;ay on this &s;ub|ject: That this interview was impo&s;ed upon me: By tho&s;e, indeed, who had a right to impo&s;e it; but that it was &s;orely again&s;t my will comply'd with, and for this rea&s;on, That there was <HI>aver&s;ion,</HI> not <HI>wilfulne&s;s,</HI> in the ca&s;e; and &s;o nothing could come of it, but a pretence, as I much apprehended, to u&s;e me &s;till more &s;everely than I had been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>She was then plea&s;ed to charge me with prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and prejudice: Expatiated upon the duty of a child: Imputed to me abundance of fine qualities; but told me, that, in this ca&s;e, <HI>that</HI> of per&s;uadable|ne&s;s was wanting to crown All. She in&s;i&s;ted upon the <HI>merit</HI> of obedience, altho' my will were <HI>not</HI> in it. From a little hint I gave of my &s;till greater di&s;like to &s;ee Mr. Solmes, on account of the freedom I had treated him with, &s;he talked to me of his forgiving di&s;po&s;ition; of his infinite re&s;pect for me; and I-can-not-tell-what of this &s;ort.&mdash;</P>
<P>I never found my&s;elf &s;o fretful in my life. I told my aunt &s;o; and begg'd her pardon for it. But &s;he &s;aid, it was well di&s;gui&s;ed then; for &s;he &s;aw nothing but little tremors u&s;ual with young Ladies, when they were to &s;ee their admirers for the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> time, as this might be called: For that it was the fir&s;t time I had con&s;ented to &s;ee him in that light.&mdash;But that the <HI>next</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>How, Madam, interrupted I!&mdash;Is it then imagined I give this meeting upon that foot?&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="177">To be &s;ure it is, child.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>To be &s;ure it is,</HI> Madam!&mdash;Then do I yet de&s;ire to decline it!&mdash;I will not, I cannot, &s;ee him, if he expects me to &s;ee him upon tho&s;e terms.</P>
<P>Nicene&s;s, punctilio!&mdash;Mere punctilio, niece!&mdash;Can you think that your appointment, Day, Place, Hour, and knowing what the intent of it was, is to be interpreted away as a mere ceremony, and to mean nothing?&mdash;Let me tell you, my dear, your father, mother, uncles, every-body, re&s;pect this appointment as the fir&s;t act of your compliance with their wills; and therefore recede not, I de&s;ire you; but make a merit of what cannot be help'd!&mdash;</P>
<P>O the hideous wretch!&mdash;Pardon me, Madam,&mdash;<HI>I</HI> to be &s;uppos'd to meet &s;uch a man as <HI>that,</HI> with &s;uch a view! and <HI>he</HI> to be arm'd with &s;uch an ex|pectation!&mdash;But it cannot be that <HI>he</HI> expects it, what|ever others may do.&mdash;It is plain he cannot, by the fear he tells you all, he &s;hall have to &s;ee me: If his <HI>hope</HI> were &s;o audacious, he could not <HI>fear</HI> &s;o much.</P>
<P>Indeed, he <HI>has</HI> this hope; and ju&s;tly founded too. But his fear ari&s;es from his reverence, as I told you before.</P>
<P><HI>His reverence!</HI>&mdash;his unworthine&s;s!&mdash;'Tis &s;o appa|rent, that he him&s;elf &s;ees it, as well as every-body el&s;e. Hence the purcha&s;e he aims at!&mdash;Hence is it, that &s;ettlements are to make up for acknowleg'd want of merit!&mdash;</P>
<P>His <HI>unworthine&s;s,</HI> &s;ay you!&mdash;Not &s;o fa&s;t, my dear. Does not this look like &s;etting a high value upon your&s;elf?&mdash;We all have exalted notions of your me|rit, niece; but neverthele&s;s, it would not be wrong, if you were to arrogate le&s;s to <HI>your&s;elf</HI>; tho' more were to be your due, than your friends attribute to you.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Madam, it &s;hould be thought arro|gance in me, to &s;uppo&s;e I am not worthy of a better man than Mr. Solmes, both as to per&s;on and mind:
<PB N="176" REF="178">
And as to fortune, I thank God I de&s;pi&s;e all that can be in&s;i&s;ted upon in his favour, from &s;o poor a plea.</P>
<P>She told me, It &s;ignify'd nothing to talk: I knew the expectation of every-one&mdash;</P>
<P>Indeed I did not.&mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible I could think of &s;uch a &s;trange expectation, upon a compliance made only to &s;hew, I would comply in all that was in my power to comply with.</P>
<P>I might ea&s;ily, me &s;aid, have &s;uppo&s;ed, that every-one thought I was beginning to oblige them all, by the kind behaviour of my brother and &s;i&s;ter to me in the garden, la&s;t Sunday; by my &s;i&s;ter's vi&s;it to me afterwards in my chamber; altho' both more &s;tiffly received by me, than were either wi&s;hed or expected; by my uncle Harlowe's affectionate vi&s;it to me the &s;ame afternoon; not indeed &s;o very gratefully received, as I u&s;ed to receive his favours:&mdash;But this he kindly imputed to the di&s;plea&s;ure I had conceived at my con|finement, and to my coming-off by degrees, that I might keep my&s;elf in countenance for my pa&s;t oppo|&s;ition!</P>
<P>See, my dear, the low cunning of that Sunday-management, which then &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed me! And &s;ee the rea&s;on why Dr. Lewin was admitted to vi&s;it me, yet forbore to enter upon a &s;ubject that I thought he came to talk to me about!&mdash;For, it &s;eems, there was no occa&s;ion to di&s;pute with me on a point I was to be <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to have conceded to.&mdash;See, al&s;o, how unfairly my brother and &s;i&s;ter mu&s;t have repre&s;ented their pretended kindne&s;s, when (tho' they had an end to an&s;wer by <HI>appearing</HI> kind) their antipathy to me &s;eems to have been &s;o &s;trong, that they could not help in&s;ulting me by their arm-in-arm lover-like behaviour to each other; as my &s;i&s;ter afterwards likewi&s;e did, when &s;he came to borrow my Kempis.&mdash;</P>
<P>I lifted up my hands and eyes!&mdash;I cannot, &s;aid I, give this treatment a name!&mdash;The <HI>end</HI> &s;o unlikely to be an&s;wer'd by <HI>means</HI> &s;o low!&mdash;I know <HI>who&s;e</HI> the whole
<PB N="177" REF="179">
is!&mdash;He that could get my uncle Harlowe to contri|bute his part, and procure the acquie&s;cence of the re&s;t of my friends to it, mu&s;t have the power to do any thing with them again&s;t me!&mdash;</P>
<P>Again my aunt told me, that talking and invective, now I had given the expectation, would &s;ignify no|thing. She hoped I would not &s;hew them all, that they had been too forward in their con&s;tructions of my de&s;ire to oblige them. She could a&s;&s;ure me, that it would be wor&s;e for me, if <HI>now</HI> I receded, than if I had never advanced&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Advanced,</HI> Madam! How can you &s;ay <HI>advanced?</HI> Why, this is a trick upon me!&mdash;A poor, low trick! Pardon me, Madam, I don't &s;ay you have a hand in it.&mdash;But, my deare&s;t aunt, tell me, Will not my mamma be pre&s;ent at this dreaded interview?&mdash;Will &s;he not &s;o far favour me?&mdash;Were it but to qualify&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Qualify,</HI> my dear, interrupted &s;he&mdash;Your mamma, and your uncle Harlowe, would not be pre&s;ent on this occa&s;ion for the world&mdash;</P>
<P>O then, Madam, how can they look upon my con&s;ent to this interview as an <HI>advance?</HI></P>
<P>My aunt was di&s;plea&s;ed at this home pu&s;h. Mi&s;s Clary, &s;aid &s;he, there is no dealing with you. It would be happy for you, and for every-body el&s;e, were your obedience as ready as your wit. I will leave you&mdash;</P>
<P>Not in anger, I hope, Madam! interrupted I&mdash;All I meant was, to ob&s;erve, that let the meeting i&s;&s;ue as it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> i&s;&s;ue, it cannot be a di&s;appointment to <HI>any-body.</HI></P>

Mi&s;s! cry'd &s;he, as fa&s;t as &s;he could &s;peak, with her arms &s;pread abroad, and all her fingers di&s;tended, and held up, will you be plea&s;ed to walk down into your own parlour?&mdash;There is every-body, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, in full <HI>congregation!</HI>&mdash;And there is Mr. Solmes, as fine as a Lord, with a charming white peruke, fine laced &s;hirt and ruffles, coat trimmed with &s;ilver, and a wai&s;tcoat &s;tanding an end with lace!&mdash;Quite hand&s;ome, believe me!&mdash;You never &s;aw &s;uch an alteration!&mdash;Ah! Mi&s;s, &s;haking her head, 'tis pity you have &s;aid &s;o much again&s;t him!&mdash;But you know how to come off, for all that!&mdash;I hope it will not be too late!&mdash;</P>
<P>Impertinence! &s;aid I,&mdash;Wert thou bid to come up in this fluttering way?&mdash;And I took up my fan, and fann'd my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me! &s;aid &s;he, how &s;oon the&s;e fine young Ladies will be put into <HI>flu&s;terations!</HI>&mdash;I meant not either to offend or frighten you, I am &s;ure.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181">Every-body there, do you &s;ay?&mdash;Who do you call every-body?&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, Mi&s;s, holding out her left palm opened, and with a flouri&s;h, and a &s;aucy leer, patting it with the fore-finger of the other at every mentioned per|&s;on, There is your papa!&mdash;There is your mamma!&mdash;There is your uncle Harlowe!&mdash;There is your uncle Antony!&mdash;Your aunt Hervey!&mdash;<HI>My</HI> young Lady!&mdash;And my young ma&s;ter!&mdash;And Mr. Solmes, with the air of a great courtier, &s;tanding up, becau&s;e he named you:&mdash;Mrs. Betty, &s;aid he, [Then the ape of a wench bowed, and &s;craped, as awkwardly as I &s;up|po&s;e the per&s;on &s;he endeavoured to imitate] Pray give my humble &s;ervice to Mi&s;s, and tell her, I wait her commands.</P>
<P>Was not this a wicked wench?&mdash;I trembled &s;o, I could hardly &s;tand. I was &s;piteful enough to &s;ay, that her young mi&s;tre&s;s, I &s;uppo&s;ed, bid her put on the&s;e airs, to frighten me out of a capacity of behaving &s;o calmly, as &s;hould procure me my uncle's com|pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What a way do you put your&s;elf in, Mi&s;s, &s;aid the in&s;olent!&mdash;Come, dear Madam, taking up my fan, which I had laid down, and approaching me with it, fanning, &s;hall I&mdash;</P>
<P>None of thy impertinence!&mdash;But &s;ay you, <HI>all</HI> my friends are below with him? And am I to <HI>appear</HI> be|fore them <HI>all?</HI></P>
<P>I can't tell if they'll &s;tay when you come. I think they &s;eemed to be moving when Mr. Solmes gave me his orders.&mdash;But what an&s;wer &s;hall I carry to the 'Squire?</P>
<P>Say, I can't go!&mdash;But yet, when 'tis over, 'tis over! Say, I'll wait upon&mdash;I'll attend&mdash;I'll come pre&s;ently&mdash;Say any thing; I care not what&mdash;But give me my fan, and fetch me a gla&s;s of water.</P>
<P>She went, and I fanned my&s;elf all the time; for I was in a flame; and hemm'd, and &s;truggled with my|&s;elf,
<PB N="180" REF="182">
all I could; and, when &s;he returned, drank my water; and finding no hope pre&s;ently of a quieter heart, I &s;ent her down, and followed her with preci|pitation; trembling &s;o, that, had I not hurried, I que&s;tion if I could have gone down at all. O, my dear, what a poor, pa&s;&s;ive machine is the body, when the mind is di&s;order'd!</P>
<P>There are two doors to <HI>my</HI> parlour, as I u&s;ed to call it. As I entered at one, my friends hurried out at the other. I &s;aw ju&s;t the gown of my &s;i&s;ter, the la&s;t who &s;lid away. My uncle Antony went out with them; but he &s;taid not long, as you &s;hall hear: And they all remained in the next parlour, a wain-&s;cot-partition only parting the two. I remember them both in one: But they were &s;eparated in favour of us girls, for each to receive her vi&s;itors in, at her plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes approached me as &s;oon as I entered, cringing to the ground; a vi&s;ible confu&s;ion in every feature of his face. After half a dozen choak'd-up Ma|dams,&mdash;He was very &s;orry&mdash;he was very much con|cerned&mdash;It was his misfortune&mdash;And there he &s;topp'd, being unable pre&s;ently to complete a &s;entence.</P>
<P>This gave me a little more pre&s;ence of mind. Cow|ardice in a foe begets courage in one's-&s;elf:&mdash;I &s;ee that plainly now;&mdash;Yet perhaps, at bottom, the new-made bravo is a greater coward than the other.</P>
<P>I turned from him, and &s;eated my&s;elf in one of the fire-&s;ide chairs, fanning my&s;elf. I have &s;ince recol|lected, that I mu&s;t have looked very &s;aucily. Could I have had any <HI>thoughts</HI> of the man, I &s;hould have de&s;pi&s;ed my&s;elf for it. But what can be &s;aid in the ca&s;e of an aver&s;ion &s;o perfectly &s;incere?</P>
<P>He hemmed five or &s;ix times, as I had done above; and the&s;e produced a &s;entence&mdash;That I could not but &s;ee his confu&s;ion. This &s;entence produced two or three more. I believe my aunt was his tutore&s;s: For it was his awe, his reverence for &s;o &s;uperlative a
<PB N="181" REF="183">
Lady&mdash;[I a&s;&s;ure you]&mdash;And he hoped&mdash;he hoped&mdash;Three times he hoped, before he told me what&mdash;that I was too generous [Genero&s;ity, he &s;aid, was my character], to de&s;pi&s;e him for &s;uch&mdash;for &s;uch&mdash;<HI>true</HI> tokens of his love.&mdash;</P>
<P>I do indeed &s;ee you under &s;ome confu&s;ion, Sir; and this gives me hope, that altho' I have been compelled, as I may call it, to this interview, it may be attended with happier effects than I had apprehended from it.</P>
<P>He had hemmed him&s;elf into more courage.</P>
<P>You could not, Madam, imagine any creature &s;o blind to your merits, and &s;o little attracted by them, as ea&s;ily to forego the intere&s;t and approbation he was honoured with by your worthy family, while he had any hope given him, that one day he might, by his per&s;everance and zeal, expect your favour.</P>
<P>I am but too much aware, Sir, that it is upon the intere&s;t and approbation you mention, that you build &s;uch hope. It is impo&s;&s;ible, otherwi&s;e, that a man, who has any regard for his <HI>own</HI> happine&s;s, would per&s;evere again&s;t &s;uch declarations as I have made, and think my&s;elf obliged to make, in ju&s;tice to you, as well as to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He had &s;een many in&s;tances, he told me, and had heard of more, where Ladies had &s;eemed as aver&s;e, and yet had been induced, &s;ome by motives of com|pa&s;&s;ion; others by per&s;ua&s;ion of friends, to change their minds; and had been very happy afterwards: And he hoped this might be the ca&s;e here.</P>
<P>I have no notion, Sir, of compliment, in an ar|ticle of &s;uch importance as this: Yet am I &s;orry to be obliged to &s;peak my mind &s;o plainly, as I am going to do.&mdash;Know then, that I have invincible objections, Sir, to your addre&s;s. I have declared them with an earne&s;tne&s;s that I believe is without example: And why?&mdash;Becau&s;e I believe it is without example, that any young creature, circum&s;tanced as I am, was ever treated as I have been treated on your account.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="184">It is hoped, Madam, that your con&s;ent may, in time, be obtained: <HI>That</HI> is the hope; and I &s;hall be a mi&s;erable man if it cannot.</P>
<P>Better, Sir, give me leave to &s;ay, you were mi|&s;erable by your&s;elf, than that you &s;hould make two &s;o.</P>
<P>You may have heard, Madam, things to my di&s;|advantage.&mdash;No man is without enemies.&mdash;Be plea&s;ed to let me know <HI>what</HI> you have heard, and I will either own my faults, and amend; or I will convince you, that I am ba&s;ely <HI>be&s;pattered:</HI> And once I under&s;tand you overheard &s;omething that I &s;hould &s;ay, that gave you offence:&mdash;Unguardedly, perhaps; but nothing but what &s;hewed my value, and that I would per&s;i&s;t &s;o long as I could have hope.</P>
<P>I have indeed heard many things to your di&s;ad|vantage:&mdash;And I was far from being plea&s;ed with what I overheard fall from your lips: But as you were not any thing to me, and never could be, it was not for me to be concerned about the one or the other.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Madam, to hear this: I am &s;ure you &s;hould not tell me of any fault, that I would be un|willing to correct in my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, correct this fault:&mdash;Do not wi&s;h to have a poor young creature compelled in the mo&s;t material article of her life, for the &s;ake of motives &s;he de&s;pi&s;es; and in behalf of a per&s;on &s;he cannot value: One that has, in her own right, &s;ufficient to &s;et her above all offers, and a &s;pirit that craves no more than what it <HI>has,</HI> to make it&s;elf ea&s;y and happy.</P>
<P>I don't &s;ee, Madam, how you would be happy, if I were to di&s;continue my addre&s;s: For&mdash;</P>
<P>That is nothing to you, Sir, interrupted I: Do you but withdraw your preten&s;ions: And if it be thought fit to &s;tart up another man for my puni&s;h|ment, the blame will not lie at your door. You will be intitled to my thanks; and mo&s;t heartily will I thank you.</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed, and &s;eemed a little at a lo&s;s: And I

was going to give him &s;till &s;tronger and more per&s;onal in&s;tances of my plain-dealing; when in came my un|cle Antony!</P>
<P>So, niece, &s;o!&mdash;&s;itting in &s;tate like a Queen, give|ing audience!&mdash;<HI>haughty</HI> audience!&mdash;Mr. Solmes, why &s;tand you thus humbly?&mdash;Why this di&s;tance, man? I hope to &s;ee you upon a more intimate footing before we part.</P>
<P>I aro&s;e, as &s;oon as he entered&mdash;and approached him with a bent knee: Let me, Sir, reverence my uncle, whom I have not for &s;o long a time &s;een!&mdash;Let me, Sir, be&s;peak your favour and compa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>You'll have the favour of every-body, niece, when you know how to de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>If ever I de&s;erved it, I de&s;erve it now.&mdash;I have been hardly u&s;ed&mdash;I have made propo&s;als that ought to have been accepted; and &s;uch as would not have been <HI>a&s;ked</HI> of me. What have I done, that I mu&s;t be bani&s;hed and confined thus di&s;gracefully? That I mu&s;t be allowed to have no free-will, in an article that concerns my pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s?&mdash;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Clary, replied my uncle, you have had your will in every-thing till now; and this makes your parents will &s;it &s;o heavy upon you.</P>
<P>My will, Sir! Be plea&s;ed to allow me to a&s;k, What was my will till now, but my father's will, and yours, and my uncle Harlowe's will?&mdash;Has it not been my pride to obey and oblige?&mdash;I never a&s;ked a favour, that I did not fir&s;t &s;it down and con&s;ider, if it were fit to be granted. And now, to &s;hew my obedience, have I not offered to live &s;ingle? Have I not offered to dive&s;t my&s;elf of my grandfather's bounty, and to ca&s;t my&s;elf upon my papa's; to be withdrawn, when|ever I di&s;oblige him? Why, dear good Sir, am I to be made unhappy in a point &s;o concerning to my happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Your grandfather's e&s;tate is not wi&s;hed from you. You are not de&s;ired to live a &s;ingle life. You know

<HI>our</HI> motives, and we gue&s;s at <HI>yours.</HI> And let me tell you, well as we love you, we would much &s;ooner choo&s;e to follow you to the grave, than that <HI>yours</HI> &s;hould take place.</P>
<P>I will engage never to marry any man, without my father's con&s;ent, and your's, Sir, and every|body's. Did I ever give you cau&s;e to doubt my word?&mdash;And here I will take the &s;olemne&s;t oath that can be offered me&mdash;</P>
<P>That is the matrimonial one, interrupted he, with a big voice&mdash;and to this gentleman.&mdash;It &s;hall, it &s;hall, cou&s;in Clary!&mdash;And the more you oppo&s;e it, the wor&s;e it &s;hall be for you.</P>
<P>This, and before the man, who &s;eem'd to a&s;&s;ume courage upon it, highly provoked me.</P>
<P>Then, Sir, you &s;hall &s;ooner follow me to the grave <HI>indeed.</HI>&mdash;I will undergo the cruele&s;t death: I will even con&s;ent to enter into the awful vault of my an|ce&s;tors, and to have that bricked up upon me, than con&s;ent to be mi&s;erable for life.&mdash;And, Mr. Solmes, (turning to him) take notice of what I &s;ay; <HI>This,</HI> or <HI>any</HI> death, I will &s;ooner undergo (That will &s;oon be over), than be yours, and for <HI>ever</HI> unhappy!</P>
<P>My uncle was in a terrible rage upon this: He took Mr. Solmes by the hand, &s;hocked as the man &s;eemed to be, and drew him to the window&mdash;Don't be &s;urpri&s;ed, Mr. Solmes, don't be concerned at <HI>this.</HI> We know, and rapp'd out a &s;ad oath, what women will &s;ay: The wind is not more boi&s;trous, nor more changeable: And again he &s;wore to That!

<P>Then coming up to me (who had thrown my&s;elf, very much di&s;ordered by my vehemence, into the contrary window), as if he would have beat me; his face violently working, his hands clenched, and his

Poor gentleman, how he &s;wore!&mdash;Strange! that people who have &s;uffered in their time &s;o much by &s;torms, &s;hould be &s;o &s;tormy!&mdash;</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, Sir, &s;aid I, to &s;ee you in &s;uch a pa&s;|&s;ion. All This, I am but too &s;en&s;ible, is owing to my brother's in&s;tigation; who would not him&s;elf give the in&s;tance of duty that is exacted from me. It is be&s;t for me to withdraw. I &s;hall but provoke you farther, I fear: For though I would gladly obey you, if I could, yet This is a point determined with me; and I cannot &s;o much as <HI>wi&s;h</HI> to get it over.</P>
<P>How could one help the&s;e &s;trong declarations, the man in pre&s;ence?</P>
<P>I was going out at the door I came in at; the gentle|men looking upon one another, as if referring to each other what to do, or whether to engage my &s;tay, or &s;uffer me to go: And who &s;hould I meet at the door but my brother, who had heard all that had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P><PB N="186" REF="188">He had led me up to meet Mr. Solmes, who&s;e hand he took, as he him&s;elf held mine. Here, Sir, &s;aid he, take the rebel daughter's hand; I give it you now; She &s;hall confirm the gift in a week's time; or will have neither father, mother, nor uncles, to boa&s;t of.</P>

<P>Let me go, Sir;&mdash;Why am I thus treated?&mdash;You <HI>de&s;ign,</HI> I doubt not, with your unmanly gripings, to hurt me, as you do: But again I &s;ay, Wherefore is it that I am to be thus treated by YOU?</P>
<P>He to&s;&s;ed my hand from him with a whirl, that pained my very &s;houlder. I wept, and held my other hand to the part.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes blamed him; &s;o did my uncle.</P>
<P>He had no patience, he &s;aid, with &s;uch a perver&s;e|ne&s;s; and to think of my reflections upon him&s;elf, before he entered. He had only given me back the hand, I had not de&s;erved he &s;hould touch. It was ene of my arts, to pretend to be pained.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes &s;aid, He would &s;ooner give up all his hopes of me, than that I &s;hould be u&s;ed unkindly: And he offered to plead in my behalf to them both; and applied him&s;elf with a bow, as if for my appro|bation of his interpo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But, I &s;aid, I am obliged to your intention, Mr. Solmes, to interpo&s;e to &s;ave me from my brother's violence: But I cannot wi&s;h to owe &s;o poor an obli|gation to a man who&s;e ungenerous per&s;everance is the occa&s;ion, or at lea&s;t the pretence, of <HI>that</HI> violence, and of all my di&s;graceful &s;ufferings.</P>

And, turning to my brother, Knit your brows, Sir, and frown as you will, I will a&s;k you, Would <HI>you,</HI> in my ca&s;e, make the &s;acrifices I am willing to make, to obtain every one's favour? If <HI>not,</HI> what right have you to treat me thus? and to procure me to be treated as I have been, for &s;o long pa&s;t?</P>
<P>I had put my&s;elf by this time into great di&s;order. They were &s;ilent, and &s;eemed to want to talk to one another by their looks, walking about in violent di&s;|orders too, between whiles.&mdash;I &s;at down fanning my|&s;elf (as it happened, again&s;t the gla&s;s) and I could per|ceive my colour go and come; and being &s;ick to the very heart, and apprehen&s;ive of fainting, I rung. Betty came in. I called for a gla&s;s of water, and drank it:&mdash;But no-hody minded me&mdash;I heard my brother pronounce the words, Art! d&mdash;d Art! to Solmes; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, kept <HI>him</HI> back, together w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th the apprehen&s;ion, that he would not be welcome.&mdash;El&s;e I could &s;ee the man was more affected than my brother. And I, &s;till fearing I &s;hould faint, ri&s;ing, took hold of Betty's arm, &s;taggering with extreme di&s;order, yet courte&s;ying to my uncle, Let me hold by you, Betty, &s;aid I; Let me withdraw.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192">Whither go you, niece, &s;aid my uncle? We have not done with you yet. I charge you depart not. Mr. Solmes has &s;omething to open to you, that will a&s;toni&s;h you:&mdash;And you <HI>&s;hall</HI> hear it.</P>
<P>Only, Sir, by your leave, for a few minutes into the air&mdash;I will return, if you command it&mdash;I will hear all that I am to hear; that it may be over <HI>Now,</HI> and <HI>for-Ever.</HI>&mdash;You will go with me, Betty?</P>
<P>And &s;o, without any farther prohibition, I retired into the garden; and there, ca&s;ting my&s;elf upon the fir&s;t &s;eat, and throwing Betty's apron over my face, leaning again&s;t her &s;ide, my hands between her's, I gave way to a violent bur&s;t of grief, or pa&s;&s;ion, or both; which, as it &s;eemed, &s;aved my heart from break|ing, for I was &s;en&s;ible of an immediate relief.</P>
<P>I have already given you &s;pecimens of Mrs. Betty's impertinence. I &s;hall not, therefore, trouble you with more: For the wench, notwith&s;tanding this my di|&s;tre&s;s, took great liberties with me, after &s;he &s;aw me a little recovered, and as I walked further into the garden; in&s;omuch, that I was obliged to &s;ilence her by an ab&s;olute prohibition of &s;aying another word to me; and then &s;he dropped behind me quite &s;ullen and gloomy.</P>
<P>It was near an hour before I was &s;ent for in again. The me&s;&s;enger was my cou&s;in Dolly Hervey, who, with an eye of compa&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect [for Mi&s;s Her|vey always loved me, and calls her&s;elf my &s;cholar, as you know] told me, my company was de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Betty left us.</P>
<P>Who commands my attendance, Mi&s;s, &s;aid I?&mdash;Have you not been in tears, my dear?</P>
<P>Who can forbear tears, &s;aid &s;he?</P>
<P>Why, what's the matter, cou&s;in Dolly?&mdash;Sure, no|body is intitled to weep in this family, but I!</P>
<P>Yes, I am, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, becau&s;e I love you.</P>
<P>I ki&s;&s;ed her; And is it for me, my &s;weet cou&s;in, that you &s;hed tears?&mdash;There never was love lo&s;t be|tween
<PB N="191" REF="193">
us: But tell me, what is de&s;igned to be done with me, that I have this kind in&s;tance of your com|pa&s;&s;ion for me?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t take no notice of what I tell you: But my mamma has been weeping for you, too, with me; but dur&s;t not let any-body &s;ee it: O my Dolly, &s;aid my mamma, there never was &s;o &s;et a malice in man, as in your cou&s;in James Harlowe. They will ruin the flower and ornament of their family.</P>
<P>As how, Mi&s;s Dolly?&mdash;Did &s;he not explain her|&s;elf?&mdash;As how, my dear?</P>
<P>Yes, &s;he &s;aid, Mr. Solmes would have given up his claim to you; for he &s;aid, you hated him, and there were no hopes; and your mamma was willing he &s;hould; and to have you taken at your word, to re|nounce Mr. Lovelace, and to live &s;ingle: My mam|ma was for it too; for they heard all that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween you and my uncle Antony, and my cou&s;in James; &s;aying, it was impo&s;&s;ible to think of prevail|ing upon you to have Mr. Solmes. My uncle Har|lowe &s;eemed in the &s;ame way of thinking; at lea&s;t, my mamma &s;ays, he did not &s;ay any thing to the con|trary. But your papa was immoveable, and was angry at your mamma and mine upon it: And here|upon your brother, your &s;i&s;ter, and my uncle Antony, joined in, and changed the &s;cene intirely. In &s;hort, &s;he &s;ays, that Mr. Solmes had great matters ingaged to him. He owned, that you were the fine&s;t young Lady in England, and he would be content to be but little beloved, if he could <HI>not,</HI> after marriage, engage your heart, for the &s;ake of having the honour to call you his but for one twelvemonth&mdash;I &s;uppo&s;e he would break your heart in the next&mdash;For he is a cruel-hearted man, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>My friends may break my heart, cou&s;in Dolly; but Mr. Solmes will never have it in his power.</P>
<P>I don't know That, Mi&s;s: You'll have good luck to avoid having him, by what I can find; for my
<PB N="192" REF="194">
mamma &s;ays, they are all now of one mind, her&s;elf excepted; and &s;he is forced to be &s;ilent, your papa and brother are both &s;o outragious.</P>
<P>I am got above minding my brother, cou&s;in Dolly: He is <HI>but</HI> my brother:&mdash;But to my papa I owe duty and obedience, if I could comply.</P>
<P>We are apt to be fond of any-body, who will &s;ide with us, when oppre&s;&s;ed, or provoked: I always loved my cou&s;in Dolly; but now &s;he endeared her&s;elf to me ten times more, by her &s;oothing concern for me. I a&s;ked what <HI>&s;he</HI> would do, were &s;he in my ca&s;e?</P>
<P>Without he&s;itation &s;he replied, Have Mr. Lovelace out-of-hand, and take up her own e&s;tate, if &s;he were me; and there would be an end of it&mdash;And Mr. Lovelace, &s;he &s;aid, was a fine gentleman;&mdash;Mr. Solmes was not worthy to <HI>buckle his &s;hoes.</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Hervey told me further, that her mamma was de&s;ired to come to me, to fetch me in; but &s;he ex|cu&s;ed her&s;elf. I &s;hould have all my friends, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he believed, &s;it in judgment upon me.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it had been &s;o. But, as I have been told &s;ince, neither my papa, nor my mamma, would tru&s;t them&s;elves with me: The one for pa&s;&s;ion-&s;ake, it &s;eems; my mamma, for tenderer con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>By this time we entered the hou&s;e. Mi&s;s accom|panied me into the parlour, and left me, as a per&s;on devoted, I ju&s;t then thought.</P>
<P>No-body was there. I &s;at down, and had lei&s;ure to weep; reflecting, with a &s;ad heart, upon what my cou&s;in Dolly had told me.</P>
<P>They were all in my &s;i&s;ter's parlour adjoining: For I heard a confu&s;ed mixture of voices, &s;ome louder than others, drowning, as it &s;eemed, the more com|pa&s;&s;ionating accents.</P>
<P><HI>Female</HI> accents I could di&s;tingui&s;h the drowned ones to be. O my dear! What a hard-hearted Sex is the other! Children of the &s;ame parents, how came they by their cruelty?&mdash;Do they get it by travel? Do
<PB N="193" REF="195">
they get it by conver&s;ation with one another?&mdash;Or how do they get it?&mdash;Yet my &s;i&s;ter too, is as hard-hearted as any of them. But this may be no exception neither: For &s;he has been thought to be ma&s;culine in her air, and in her &s;pirit. She has then, perhaps, a &s;oul of the <HI>other</HI> Sex in a body of <HI>ours.</HI>&mdash;And &s;o, for the honour of <HI>our own,</HI> will I judge of every wo|man for the future, who, imitating the rougher man|ners of men, acts unbe&s;eeming the gentlene&s;s of her own &s;ex.</P>
<P>Forgive me, my dear friend, breaking into my &s;tory by the&s;e reflections. Were I rapidly to pur&s;ue my narration, without thinking, without reflecting, I believe I &s;hould hardly be able to keep in my right mind: Since vehemence and pa&s;&s;ion would then be al|ways uppermo&s;t; but while I <HI>think</HI> as I write, I cool, and my hurry of &s;pirits is allayed.</P>
<P>I believe I was above a quarter of an hour enjoy|ing my own comfortle&s;s contemplations, before any-body came in to me; for they &s;eemed in full de|bate. My aunt looked in fir&s;t; O my dear, &s;aid &s;he, are you there? and withdrew ha&s;tily to appri&s;e them of it.</P>
<P>And then (as agreed upon, I &s;uppo&s;e) in came my uncle Antony, crediting Mr. Solmes with the words, <HI>Let me lead you in, my dear friend</HI>; having hold of his hand; while the new-made Beau aukwardly fol|lowed, but more edgingly, as I may &s;ay, &s;etting his feet mincingly, to avoid treading upon his leader's heels. Excu&s;e me, my dear, this &s;eeming levity; but tho&s;e we do not love, in every thing are ungrace|ful with us.</P>
<P>I &s;tood up. My uncle looked very &s;urly.&mdash;Sit down!&mdash;&s;it down, girl!&mdash;And drawing a chair near me, he placed his <HI>dear</HI> friend in it, whether he would or not, I having taken my &s;eat. And my uncle &s;at on the other &s;ide of me.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">Well, niece, taking my hand, we &s;hall have very little more to &s;ay to you than we have already &s;aid, as to the &s;ubject that is &s;o di&s;ta&s;teful to you&mdash;Unle&s;s, indeed, you have better con&s;idered of the matter&mdash;And fir&s;t, let me know if you have?</P>
<P>The matter wants no con&s;ideration, Sir.</P>
<P>Very well, very well, <HI>Madam!</HI> &s;aid my uncle, withdrawing his hands from mine: Could I ever have thought of this from you?</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, deare&s;t Madam, &s;aid Mr. Solmes, folding his hands&mdash;And there he &s;topped.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, <HI>what,</HI> Sir?&mdash;How came God's &s;ake, and your &s;ake, I pray you, to be the &s;ame?</P>
<P>This &s;ilenc'd <HI>him.</HI> My uncle could <HI>only</HI> be angry; and that he was before.</P>
<P>Well, well, well, Mr. Solmes, &s;aid my uncle, no more of &s;upplication. You have not confidence enough to expect a woman's favour.</P>
<P>He then was plea&s;ed to hint what great things he had de&s;igned to do for me; and that it was more for <HI>my</HI> &s;ake, after he returned from the Indies, than for the &s;ake of any <HI>other</HI> of the family, that he had re&s;olved to live a &s;ingle life.&mdash;But now, concluded he, that the perver&s;e girl de&s;pi&s;es all the great things it was once as much in my will, as in my power, to do for her, I will change my mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>I told him, that I mo&s;t &s;incerely thanked him for all his kind intentions to me: But that I was willing to re&s;ign all claim to any <HI>other</HI> of his favours than kind looks, and kind words.</P>
<P>He looked about him this way and that.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes looked pitifully down.</P>
<P>But both being &s;ilent, I was &s;orry, I added, that I had too much rea&s;on to &s;ay a very har&s;h thing, as it might be thought; which was, That if he would but be plea&s;ed to convince my brother and &s;i&s;ter, that he was ab&s;olutely determined to alter his generous pur|po&s;es towards me, it might po&s;&s;ibly procure me
<PB N="195" REF="197">
better quarter from both, than I was otherwi&s;e likely to have.</P>
<P>My uncle was very much di&s;plea&s;ed. But he had not the opportunity to expre&s;s his di&s;plea&s;ure, as he &s;eemed prepared to do; for in came my brother in exceeding great wrath; and called me &s;everal vile names. His &s;ucce&s;s hitherto, had &s;et him above keep|ing even decent mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Was This my &s;piteful con&s;truction, he a&s;ked?&mdash;Was This the interpretation I put upon his brotherly care of me, and concern for me, in order to prevent my ruining my&s;elf?</P>
<P>It <HI>is,</HI> indeed it <HI>is,</HI> &s;aid I: I know no other way to account for your late behaviour to me: And before your face, I repeat my reque&s;t to my uncle, and I will make it to my other uncle, whenever I am per|mitted to &s;ee him, that they will confer all their fa|vours upon you, and my &s;i&s;ter; and only make me happy [It is all I wi&s;h for!] in their kind looks, and kind words&mdash;</P>
<P>How they all gazed upon one another!&mdash;But could I be le&s;s peremptory before the man?</P>
<P>And, as to <HI>your</HI> care and concern for me, Sir, turn|ing to my brother; once more, I de&s;ire it not. You are but my brother. My papa and mamma, I ble&s;s God, are both living; and, were they <HI>not,</HI> you have given me abundant rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on to &s;ay, that you are the very la&s;t per&s;on I would wi&s;h to have any concern for me.</P>
<P>How, Niece? And is a Brother, an <HI>only</HI> Brother, of &s;o little con&s;ideration with you, as this comes to? And ought he to have no concern for his &s;i&s;ter's ho|nour, and the family's honour?</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> honour, Sir!&mdash;I de&s;ire none of his concern for That! It never was endanger'd till it had his unde&s;ired concern!&mdash;Forgive me, Sir&mdash;But when my brother knows how to act like a brother, or behave like a gen|tleman, he may de&s;erve more con&s;ideration from me, than it is po&s;&s;ible for me to think he now does.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198">I thought my brother would have beat me upon this&mdash;But my uncle &s;tood between us.</P>
<P>Violent girl, however, he called me!&mdash;Who, &s;aid he, would have thought it of her?</P>
<P>Then was Mr. Solmes told, that I was unworthy of his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>But Mr. Solmes warmly took my part: He could not bear, he &s;aid, that I &s;hould be treated &s;o roughly.</P>
<P>And &s;o very much did he exert him&s;elf on this oc|ca&s;ion, and &s;o patiently was his warmth received by my brother, that I began to &s;u&s;pect, that it was a con|trivance to make me think my&s;elf obliged to him; and that it might, perhaps, be one end of the pre&s;&s;ed-for interview.</P>
<P>The very &s;u&s;picion of this low artifice, violent as I was thought to be before, put me &s;till more out of patience; and my uncle and my brother again prai&s;ing his wonderful genero&s;ity, and his noble re|turn of good for evil, You are a happy man, Mr. Solmes, &s;aid I, that you can &s;o <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> confer obliga|tions upon a whole family, except one ingrateful per|&s;on of it, whom you &s;eem to intend <HI>mo&s;t</HI> to oblige; but who, being made unhappy by your favour, de|&s;erves not to owe to <HI>you</HI> any protection from the vio|lence of a brother.</P>
<P>Then was I a rude, an ingrateful, an unworthy creature.</P>
<P>I own it all!&mdash;All, all you can call me, or think me, brother, do I own. I own my own unworthi|ne&s;s with regard to This gentleman: I take your word for his abundant merit, which I have neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to examine into&mdash;It may, perhaps, be as great as your own&mdash;But yet I cannot thank him for his mediation: For who &s;ees not, looking at my uncle, that this is giving him&s;elf a merit with every|body at my expence?</P>
<P>Then turning to my brother, who &s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ed into &s;ilence by my warmth, I mu&s;t al&s;o acknowlege,
<PB N="197" REF="199">
Sir, the favour of <HI>your</HI> &s;uperabundant care for me. But I di&s;charge you of it; at lea&s;t, while I have the happine&s;s of nearer and dearer relations.

<P>He went to that which led into my &s;i&s;ter's parlour; and this &s;entence I heard thundered from the mouth of one who had a right to all my reverence: Son James, let the rebel be this moment carried away to my brother's&mdash;This very moment&mdash;She &s;hall not &s;tay one hour more under my roof!</P>
<P>I trembled; I was ready to &s;ink.

<P>My uncle put his handkerchief to his eyes: Mr. Solmes made a &s;till more grievous face than he had be|fore. But my brother's marble heart was untouched.</P>
<P>I will not &s;tir from my knees, continued I, without admi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;At this door I beg it!&mdash;O let it be the door of mercy! And open it to me, ho|noured Sir, I be&s;eech you!&mdash;But this once, this once! altho' you were afterwards to &s;hut it again&s;t me for ever!</P>
<P>The door was endeavoured to be opened on the in&s;ide, which made my brother let go the key on a

But every|body was gone, except Betty, who helped to rai&s;e me up; and I looked round that apartment, and &s;eeing no|body there, re-entered the other, leaning upon Betty; and then threw my&s;elf into the chair which I had &s;at in before; and my eyes overflowed, to my great re|lief: While my uncle Antony, my brother, and Mr. Solmes, left me, and went to my other relations.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;ed among them, I know not: But my brother came in by the time I had tolerably recovered my&s;elf, with a &s;ettled and haughty gloom upon his brow&mdash;Your father and mother command you in|&s;tantly to prepare for your uncle Antony's.

<P>That will not be granted you. So prepare for this very night. And give up your keys. Give them to <HI>me,</HI> Mi&s;s. I'll carry them to your mamma.</P>

<P>Indeed you mu&s;t. In no one in&s;tance comply, Madam Clary?</P>
<P>Not in this, Sir.</P>
<P>Have you any thing you are afraid &s;hould be &s;een by your mamma?</P>
<P>Not, if I be permitted to attend my mamma.</P>
<P>I'll make a report accordingly.</P>
<P>He went out.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201">In came Mi&s;s Dolly Hervey: I am &s;orry, Madam, to be the me&s;&s;enger!&mdash;But your mamma in&s;i&s;ts upon your &s;ending up all the keys of your cabinet, library, and drawers.</P>

<P>She wept &s;till more, and &s;aid, It is &s;ad, very &s;ad, to &s;ee matters thus carried!</P>

<P>Such a bold-face, as &s;he, I told her, &s;hould not hinder me.</P>

<P>Return, return, Mi&s;s&mdash;No going up yet.</P>

<P>My uncle placed Mr. Solmes on the other &s;ide of me: Him&s;elf over-again&s;t me, almo&s;t clo&s;e to me. Finely be&s;et now, my dear! Was I not?</P>
<P>Your brother, child, &s;aid my aunt, is too pa&s;&s;ion|ate&mdash;His zeal for <HI>your</HI> welfare pu&s;hes him on a little too vehemently.</P>
<P>Very true, &s;aid my uncle: But no more of This. We would now be glad to &s;ee if milder means will do with you&mdash;Tho', indeed, they were tried before.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="203">I a&s;ked my aunt, If it were nece&s;&s;ary, that That gentleman &s;hould be pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>There is a rea&s;on, that he &s;hould, &s;aid my aunt, as you will hear by-and-by. But I mu&s;t tell you, fir&s;t, that, thinking you was a little too angrily treated by your brother, your mamma de&s;ired me to try what gentler means would do upon a &s;pirit &s;o generous as we u&s;ed to think yours.</P>
<P>Nothing can be done, Madam, I mu&s;t pre&s;ume to &s;ay, if This gentleman's addre&s;s be the end.</P>
<P>She looked upon my uncle, who bit his lip, and looked upon Mr. Solmes, who rubbed his cheek; and &s;haking her head, Good, dear creature, &s;aid &s;he, be calm:&mdash;Let me a&s;k you, If &s;omething would have been done, had you been gentler u&s;ed, than you &s;eem to think you have been?</P>
<P>No, Madam, I cannot &s;ay it would, in this gentle|man's favour. You know, Madam, you know, Sir, to my uncle, I ever valued my&s;elf upon my &s;incerity: And once, indeed, had the happine&s;s to be valued for it.</P>
<P>My uncle took Mr. Solmes a&s;ide. I heard him &s;ay, whi&s;peringly, She mu&s;t, &s;he &s;hall, be &s;till yours!&mdash;We'll &s;ee, who'll conquer, parents, or child, un|cles, or niece!&mdash;I doubt not to be witne&s;s to all this being got over, and many a good-humour'd je&s;t made of this high phren&s;y!</P>
<P>I was heartily vexed.</P>
<P>Tho' we cannot find out, continued he, yet we <HI>guess,</HI> who puts her upon this ob&s;tinate behaviour. It is not natural to her, man. Nor would I concern my&s;elf &s;o much about her, but that I know what I &s;ay to be true, and intend to do great things for her.</P>
<P>I will hourly pray for that happy time, whi&s;per'd, as audibly, Mr. Solmes. I never will revive the remem|brance of what is now &s;o painful to me.</P>
<P>Well, but, niece, I am to tell you, &s;aid my aunt, that the &s;ending up your keys, without making any conditions, has wrought for you what nothing el&s;e
<PB N="202" REF="204">
could have done.&mdash;That, and the not finding any|thing that could give them umbrage, together with Mr. Solmes's interpo&s;ition&mdash;</P>
<P>O, Madam, let me not owe an obligation to Mr. Solmes.&mdash;I cannot repay it, except by my <HI>thanks</HI>; and <HI>tho&s;e</HI> only on condition that he will decline his &s;uit. To my thanks, Sir, (turning to him) if you have a heart capable of humanity, if you have any e&s;teem for me, for my <HI>own</HI> &s;ake, I be&s;eech you to intitle your&s;elf!&mdash;I be&s;eech you, do!&mdash;</P>
<P>O Madam, cry'd he, believe, believe, believe me, it is impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;While you are &s;ingle, I will hope. While that hope is encouraged by &s;o many worthy friends, I mu&s;t per&s;evere!&mdash;I mu&s;t not &s;light <HI>them,</HI> Madam, becau&s;e you &s;light <HI>me.</HI></P>
<P>I an&s;wered him with a look of high di&s;dain; and, turning from him&mdash;But what favour, dear Madam, (to my aunt) has the in&s;tance of duty you mention procur'd me?</P>
<P>Your mamma and Mr. Solmes, replied my aunt, have prevailed, that your reque&s;t, to &s;tay here till Monday next, &s;hall be granted, if you will promi&s;e to go chearfully then.</P>
<P>Let me but choo&s;e my own vi&s;itors, and I will go to my uncle's hou&s;e with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Well, niece, &s;aid my aunt, we mu&s;t wave this &s;ubject, I find. We will now proceed to another, which will require your utmo&s;t attention. It will give you the rea&s;on why Mr. Solmes's pre&s;ence is re|qui&s;ite.&mdash;</P>
<P>Ay, &s;aid my uncle, and &s;hew you what &s;ort of a man Somebody is. Mr. Solmes, pray favour us, in the fir&s;t place, with the letter you received from your anonymous friend.</P>
<P>I will, Sir. And out he pulled a letter-ca&s;e, and, taking out a letter, It is written in an&s;wer to one &s;ent to the per&s;on. It is &s;uper&s;cribed, <HI>To Roger Solmes, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>.</HI> It begins thus: <HI>Honoured Sir</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205">I beg your pardon, Sir, &s;aid I: But what, pray, is the intent of reading this letter to me?</P>
<P>To let you know, what a vile man you are thought to have &s;et your heart upon, &s;aid my uncle, in an audible whi&s;per.</P>
<P>If, Sir, it be &s;u&s;pected, that I have &s;et my heart upon any other, why is Mr. Solmes to give him&s;elf any farther trouble about me?</P>
<P>Only hear, niece, &s;aid my aunt: Only hear what Mr. Solmes has to read, and to &s;ay to you, on this head.</P>
<P>If, Madam, Mr. Solmes will be plea&s;ed to declare, that he has no view to &s;erve, no end to promote, for him&s;elf, I will hear any thing he &s;hall read. But if the contrary, you mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay, That it will abate with me a great deal of the weight of whatever he &s;hall produce.</P>
<P>Hear it but read, niece, &s;aid my aunt.&mdash;</P>
<P>Hear it read, &s;aid my uncle.&mdash;You are &s;o ready to take part with&mdash;</P>
<P>With any-body, Sir, that is accu&s;ed anonymou&s;ly; and from intere&s;ted motives.</P>
<P>He began to read; and there &s;eemed to be a heavy load of charges in this letter, again&s;t the poor cri|minal: But I &s;topped the reading of it, and &s;aid, It will not be <HI>my</HI> fault, if this vilified man be not as indifferent to me, as one whom I never &s;aw. If he be otherwi&s;e at pre&s;ent, which I neither own, nor deny, it proceeds from the &s;trange methods taken to prevent it. Do not let one cau&s;e unite him and me, and we &s;hall not be united. If my offer to live &s;ingle be accepted, he &s;hall be no more to me than <HI>this</HI> gen|tleman.</P>
<P>Still&mdash;Proceed, Mr. Solmes&mdash;Hear it out, niece, was my uncle's cry.</P>
<P>But, to what purpo&s;e, Sir? &s;aid I&mdash;Has not Mr. Solmes a <HI>view</HI> in this? And, be&s;ides, can any-thing
<PB N="204" REF="206">
wor&s;e be &s;aid of Mr. Lovelace, than I have heard &s;aid for &s;everal months pa&s;t?</P>
<P>But this, &s;aid my uncle, and what Mr. Solmes can tell you be&s;ides, amounts to the <HI>fulle&s;t proof</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Was the unhappy man, then, &s;o freely treated in his character before, <HI>without</HI> full proof? I be&s;eech you, Sir, give me not <HI>too good</HI> an opinion of Mr. Lovelace; as I may have, if &s;uch pains be taken to make him guilty, by one who means not his reforma|tion by it; nor to do good, if I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay &s;o in this ca&s;e, to any-body but him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I &s;ee very plainly, &s;aid my uncle, your prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, your fond prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for the per&s;on of a man without morals.</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, &s;aid my aunt, you too much ju&s;tify all our apprehen&s;ions. Surprising! that a young creature of virtue and honour &s;hould thus e&s;teem a man of a quite oppo&s;ite character!</P>
<P>Dear Madam, do not conclude again&s;t me too ha&s;tily. I believe Mr. Lovelace is far from being &s;o good as he ought to be: But if every man's private life were &s;earched into by <HI>prejudiced people,</HI> &s;et on for that purpo&s;e, I know not who&s;e reputation would be &s;afe. I love a virtuous character, as much in man, as in woman. I think it as requi&s;ite, and as meritorious, in the one as in the other. And, if left to my&s;elf, I would prefer a per&s;on of &s;uch a cha|racter to Royalty, without it.</P>
<P>Why then, &s;aid my uncle&mdash;</P>
<P>Give me leave, Sir&mdash;But I may venture to &s;ay, that many of tho&s;e who have e&s;caped cen&s;ure, have not merited applau&s;e.</P>
<P>Permit me to ob&s;erve further, That Mr. Solmes himself may not be ab&s;olutely faultle&s;s. I never heard of his virtues. Some vices I have heard of&mdash;Excu&s;e me, Mr. Solmes, I &s;peak to your face&mdash;The text about <HI>ca&s;ting the fir&s;t &s;tone</HI> affords an excellent le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="207">He looked down; but was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace may have vices <HI>you</HI> have not. You may have others, which <HI>he</HI> has not.&mdash;I &s;peak not this to defend him, or to accu&s;e you. No man is bad, no one is good, in <HI>every-thing.</HI> Mr. Lovelace, for example, is &s;aid to be implacable, and to hate my friends; that does not make me value him the more. But give me leave to &s;ay, That they hate <HI>him</HI> as bad. Mr. Solmes has his antipathies, likewi&s;e, very <HI>&s;trong</HI> ones! and tho&s;e to his <HI>own relations!</HI> which I don't find to be the other's fault; for he lives well with <HI>his.</HI>&mdash;Yet he may have as bad:&mdash;Wor&s;e, pardon me, he cannot have, in my poor opinion: For what mu&s;t be the man, who <HI>hates his own fle&s;h?</HI></P>
<P>You know not, Madam; All in one breath.</P>
<P>You know not, Niece; All in one breath.</P>
<P>You know not, Clary; All in one breath.</P>
<P>I may not, nor do I de&s;ire to know his rea&s;ons: It concerns me not to know them: But the world, even the impartial part of it, accu&s;es him. If the world is unju&s;t, or ra&s;h, in <HI>one</HI> man's ca&s;e, why may it not be &s;o in <HI>another</HI>'s? That's all I mean by it. Nor can there be a greater &s;ign of want of merit, than where a man &s;eeks to pull down another's character, in order to build up his own.</P>
<P>The poor man's face was all this time over&s;pread with confu&s;ion; it appearing as if he were ready to cry; twi&s;ted, as it were, and all awry, neither mouth nor no&s;e &s;tanding in the middle of it. And had he been capable of pitying me, I had certainly tried to pity him.</P>
<P>They all three gazed upon one another in &s;ilence. My aunt, I &s;aw (at lea&s;t I thought &s;o), looked as if &s;he would have been glad &s;he might have appeared to approve of what I &s;aid. She but feebly blamed me, when &s;he &s;poke, for not hearing what Mr. Solmes had to &s;ay. He him&s;elf &s;eemed not now very earne&s;t to be heard. My uncle &s;aid, There was no talking to me. And I &s;hould
<PB N="206" REF="208">
have ab&s;olutely &s;ilenced both gentlemen, had not my brother come in again to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>This was the &s;trange &s;peech he made at his entrance his eyes flaming with anger; This prating girl has &s;truck you all dumb, I perceive. Per&s;evere how|ever, Mr. Solmes. I have heard every word &s;he has &s;aid: And I know no other method of being even with her, than, after &s;he is yours, to make her as &s;en&s;ible of your power, as &s;he now makes you of her in&s;olence.</P>
<P>Fie, cou&s;in Harlowe! &s;aid my aunt&mdash;Could I have thought a <HI>brother</HI> would have &s;aid this to a gentleman, of a <HI>&s;i&s;ter?</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t, tell you, Madam, &s;aid he, that <HI>you</HI> give the rebel courage. You your&s;elf &s;eem to favour too much the arrogance of her &s;ex in her; otherwi&s;e &s;he dur&s;t not have thus &s;topp'd her uncle's mouth by re|flections upon him; as well as denied to hear a gen|tleman tell her the danger &s;he is in from a libertine, who&s;e protection, as &s;he has plainly hinted, &s;he in|tends to claim again&s;t her family.</P>
<P><HI>Stopped my uncle's mouth, by reflexions upon him, Sir!</HI> &s;aid I, How can that be! How <HI>dare</HI> you to make &s;uch an application as This!</P>
<P>My aunt wept at his reflection upon her.&mdash;Cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he to him, If <HI>This</HI> be the thanks I have for my trouble, I have done: Your father would not treat me thus:&mdash;And I <HI>will</HI> &s;ay, that the hint you gave was an unbrotherly one.</P>
<P>Not more unbrotherly than all the re&s;t of his con|duct to me, of late, Madam, &s;aid I. I &s;ee, by this &s;pecimen of his violence, how every-body has been brought into his mea&s;ures. Had I any the lea&s;t ap|prehen&s;ion of ever being in Mr. Solmes's power, this <HI>might</HI> have affected me. But you &s;ee, Sir, to Mr. Solmes, what a conduct is thought nece&s;&s;ary to en|able you to arrive at your ungenerous end. You &s;ee how my brother <HI>courts</HI> for you!</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209">I di&s;claim Mr. Harlowe's violence, Madam, with all my &s;oul. I will never remind you&mdash;</P>
<P>Silence, worthy Sir! &s;aid I; I will take care you never &s;hall have the opportunity.</P>
<P>Le&s;s violence, Clary, &s;aid my uncle. Cou&s;in James, you are as much to blame as your &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>In then came my &s;i&s;ter. Brother, &s;aid &s;he, you kept not your promi&s;e. You are thought to be to blame within, as well as here. Were not Mr. Solmes's genero&s;ity and affection to the girl <HI>well</HI> known, what you have &s;aid would be inexcu&s;able. My papa de&s;ires to &s;peak with you; and with you, aunt; and with you, uncle; and with you, Mr. Solmes, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>They all four withdrew into the next apartment.</P>
<P>I &s;tood &s;ilent, as not knowing, till &s;he &s;poke, how to take this intervention of my &s;i&s;ter's.&mdash;O thou perver&s;e thing, &s;aid &s;he, (poking out her angry face at me, when they were all gone, but &s;peaking &s;pitefully low)&mdash;What troubles do you give to us all!</P>
<P>You and my brother, Bella, &s;aid I, give trouble to your&s;elves; for neither you nor he have any bu&s;ine&s;s to concern your&s;elves about me.</P>
<P>She threw out &s;ome &s;piteful expre&s;&s;ions, &s;till in a low voice, as if &s;he cho&s;e not to be heard without; and I thought it be&s;t to oblige her to rai&s;e her tone a little, if I could. If I <HI>could,</HI> did I &s;ay? It is ea&s;y to make a pa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit an&s;wer all our views upon it.</P>
<P>She accordingly flamed out in a rai&s;ed tone: And this brought my cou&s;in Dolly in to us. Mi&s;s Har|lowe, your company is de&s;ired.</P>
<P>I will come pre&s;ently, cou&s;in Dolly.</P>
<P>But again provoking a &s;everity from me which &s;he could not bear, and calling me names; in once more came Dolly, with another me&s;&s;age, that her company was de&s;ired.</P>
<P>Not mine, I doubt, Mi&s;s Dolly, &s;aid I.</P>
<P>The &s;weet-temper'd girl bur&s;t out into tears, and &s;hook her head.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="210">Go in before me, child, &s;aid Bella (vexed to set her concern for me), with thy &s;harp face like a new moon: What do&s;t thou cry for? Is it to make thy keen face look &s;till keener?</P>
<P>I believe Bella was blamed, too, when &s;he went in; for I heard her &s;ay, The <HI>creature</HI> was &s;o provoking there was no keeping a re&s;olution.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes, after a little while, came in again by him&s;elf, to take leave of me: Full of &s;crapes and compliments; but too well tutored and encouraged, to give me hope of his declining. He begged me not to impute to him any of the &s;evere things to which he had been a &s;orrowful witne&s;s. He be&s;ought my compa&s;&s;ion, as he called it.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, the re&s;ult was, That he had &s;till hopes given him; and, altho' di&s;couraged by me, he was re|&s;olved to per&s;evere, while I remained &s;ingle:&mdash;And &s;uch long and &s;uch painful &s;ervices he talk'd of, as never were heard of.</P>
<P>I told him, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, what he had to tru&s;t to.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till he determined to per&s;i&s;t.&mdash;While I was no man's el&s;e, he mu&s;t hope.</P>
<P>What! &s;aid I, will you &s;till per&s;i&s;t, when I de|clare, as I now do, that my affections are engaged?&mdash;And let my brother make the mo&s;t of it.&mdash;</P>
<P>He knew my principles, and adored me for them.</P>
<P>He doubted not, that it was in his power to make me happy: And he was &s;ure I would not want the will to be &s;o.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured him, that, were I to be carried to my uncle's, it &s;hould an&s;wer no end; for I would never &s;ee him; nor receive a line from him; nor hear a word in his favour, whoever were the per&s;on who &s;hould mention him to me.</P>
<P>He was &s;orry for it. He mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, were I to hold in that mind. But he doubted not, that I might be induced by my father and uncles to change it.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="211">Never, never, he might depend upon it.</P>
<P>It was richly worth his patience, and the trial.</P>

<P>He hoped I &s;hould be induced to think otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And then would he have run into his fortune, his &s;ettlements, his affection&mdash;Vowing, that never man loved a woman with &s;o &s;incere a pa&s;&s;ion, as he loved me.</P>

<P>Let me not kneel in vain, Madam: Let me not be thus de&s;pi&s;ed.&mdash;And he looked mo&s;t odiou&s;ly &s;or|rowful.</P>

<P>The wretch him&s;elf, &s;he tells me, pretends to be more in love with me than before; and to be rather delighted, than di&s;couraged, with the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between us. He run on, &s;he &s;ays, in raptures, about the grace wherewith I &s;hould dignify his board; and the like &s;ort of &s;tuff, either of <HI>his</HI> &s;aying, or <HI>her</HI> making.</P>
<P>She clo&s;ed all with a Now is my time to &s;ubmit with a grace, and to make my own terms with him:&mdash;
<PB N="212" REF="214">
El&s;e, <HI>&s;he</HI> can tell me, were <HI>&s;he</HI> Mr. Solmes, it &s;hould be wor&s;e for me: And who, Mi&s;s, of <HI>our</HI> &s;ex, pro|ceeded the &s;aucy creature, would admire a raki&s;h gen|tleman, when &s;he might be admired by a &s;ober one to the end of the chapter?</P>
<P>The creature tells me, I have had <HI>amazing</HI> good luck, to keep my writings concealed &s;o cunningly&punc; I mu&s;t needs think, that &s;he knows I am always at my pen: And as I endeavour to hide that knowlege from her, &s;he is not obliged to keep my &s;ecret. But that &s;he loves not to aggravate. She had rather recon|cile by much. Peace-making is her talent, and ever was. And had &s;he been as much my foe, as I ima|gined, I had not perhaps been here now.&mdash;But this, however, &s;he &s;aid not to make a merit with me: For, truly, it would be better for me the &s;ooner every|thing was over with me. And better for her, and every-one el&s;e; that was certain.&mdash;Yet one hint &s;he mu&s;t conclude with; that my pen and ink, &s;he would a&s;&s;ure me (&s;oon as I was to go away), would not be long in my power. And then, having lo&s;t <HI>that</HI> amu&s;e|ment, it would be &s;een, how a mind &s;o active as mine, would be able to employ it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This hint has &s;uch an effect upon me, that I &s;hall in&s;tantly begin to conceal, in different places, pens, ink, and paper; and to depo&s;ite &s;ome in the ivy-&s;ummer-hou&s;e, if I can find a &s;afe place; and, at the wor&s;t, I have got a pencil of black, and another of red, lead, which I u&s;e in my drawings; and my pat|terns &s;hall &s;erve for paper, if I have no other.</P>
<P>How lucky it was, that I had got away my papers! They made a &s;trict &s;earch for them; That I can &s;ee, by the di&s;orderly manner they have left all things in: For you know that I am &s;uch an ob&s;erver of method, that I can go to a bit of ribband, or lace, or edging, blindfold: The &s;ame in my books; which they have &s;trangely di&s;ordered and mi&s;matched, to look <HI>behind</HI> them, and <HI>in</HI> &s;ome of them, I &s;uppo&s;e.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Wednesday, Eleven o' Clock, April 5.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Mu&s;t write as I have opportunity; making u&s;e of my concealed &s;tores: For my pens and ink (all of each, that they could find) are taken from me; as I &s;hall tell you more particularly by-and-by.</P>
<P>About an hour ago, I depo&s;ited my long letter to you; as al&s;o, in the u&s;ual place, a billet to Mr. Lovelace, le&s;t his impatience &s;hould put him upon &s;ome ra&s;hne&s;s; &s;ignifying, in four lines,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That the interview was over; and that I hoped my &s;teady re|fu&s;al of Mr. Solmes would di&s;courage any further applications to me in his favour.'</Q></P>
<P>Altho' I was unable, through the fatigue I had un|degone, and by rea&s;on of &s;itting up all night to write to you, (which made me lie longer than ordinary this morning) to depo&s;it my letter to you &s;ooner; yet I hope you will have it in &s;uch good time, as that you will be able to &s;end me an an&s;wer to it this night, or in the morning early; which, if ever &s;o &s;hort, will in|form me, whether I may depend upon your mamma's indulgence, or not. This it behoves me to know as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; for they are re&s;olved to hurry me away on Saturday next, at farthe&s;t; perhaps to-mor|row.</P>
<P>I will now inform you of all that happen'd previous
<PB N="214" REF="216">
to their taking away my pen and ink, as well as of the manner in which that act of violence, as I may call it, was committed; and this as briefly as I can.</P>
<P>My aunt, (who with Mr. Solmes, and my two uncles) lives here, I think, came up to me, and &s;aid, &s;he would fain have me hear what Mr. Solmes had to &s;ay of Mr. Lovelace&mdash;Only that I might be appri&s;ed of &s;ome things, that would convince me what a vile man he is, and what a wretched hu&s;band he mu&s;t make.&mdash;I might give them what degree of credit I plea&s;ed; and take them with abatement for Mr. Solmes's intere&s;tedne&s;s, if I thought fit.&mdash;But it might be of u&s;e to me, were it but to que&s;tion Mr. Love|lace indirectly upon &s;ome of them, that related to <HI>my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>I was indifferent, I &s;aid, about what he could &s;ay of me, as I was &s;ure it could not be to my di&s;ad|vantage; and as <HI>he</HI> had no rea&s;on to impute to me the forwardne&s;s which my unkind friends had &s;o cau&s;e|le&s;ly taxed me with.</P>
<P>She &s;aid, That he gave him&s;elf high airs on ac|count of his family; and &s;poke as de&s;picably of ours, as if an alliance with <HI>us</HI> were beneath him.</P>
<P>I reply'd, That he was a very unworthy man, if it were true, to &s;peak &s;lightingly of a family, which was as good as his own, 'bating that it was not allied to the peerage: That the dignity it&s;elf, I thought, convey'd more &s;hame than honour to de&s;cendents, who had not merit to adorn, as well as to be adorned by it: That my brother's ab&s;urd pride, indeed, which made him every-where declare, he would never marry but to <HI>quality,</HI> gave a di&s;graceful preference again&s;t ours: But that were I to be a&s;&s;ured, that Mr. Love|lace were capable of &s;o mean a pride, as to in&s;ult us, or value him&s;elf, on &s;uch an accidental advantage, I &s;hould think as de&s;picably of his &s;en&s;e, as every-body el&s;e did of his morals.</P>
<P>She in&s;i&s;ted upon it, that he <HI>had</HI> taken &s;uch liber|ties;
<PB N="215" REF="217">
and offer'd to give &s;ome in&s;tances, which, &s;he &s;aid, would &s;urpri&s;e me.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer'd, That were it ever &s;o certain, that Mr. Lovelace had taken &s;uch liberties, it would be but common ju&s;tice, (&s;o much hated as he was by all our family, and &s;o much inveighed again&s;t in all compa|nies by them) to inquire into the provocation he had to &s;ay what was imputed to him; and whether the value &s;ome of my friends put upon the riches they po&s;&s;e&s;s, (throwing perhaps contempt upon every other advantage, and even di&s;crediting <HI>their own</HI> preten&s;ions to family, in order to depreciate <HI>his</HI>) might not pro|voke him to like contempts. Upon the whole, Ma|dam, &s;aid I, can you &s;ay, that the inveteracy lies not as much on <HI>our</HI> &s;ide, as on <HI>his?</HI> Can <HI>he</HI> &s;ay any-thing of <HI>us</HI> more di&s;re&s;pectful, than <HI>we</HI> &s;ay of him?&mdash;And as to the &s;ugge&s;tion, &s;o often repeated, that he would make a bad hu&s;band, is it po&s;&s;ible for him to u&s;e a wife wor&s;e than I am u&s;ed; particularly by my brother and &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>Ah, niece! ah, my dear! how firmly has this wicked man attached you!</P>
<P>Perhaps not, Madam. But really great care &s;hould be taken by fathers and mothers, when they would have their daughters of <HI>their</HI> minds in the&s;e particu|lars, not to &s;ay things that &s;hall nece&s;&s;itate the child, in honour and genero&s;ity, to take part with the man her friends are aver&s;e to. But, waving all this, as I have offered to renounce him for ever, I &s;ee not why he &s;hould be mentioned to me, nor why I &s;hould be wi&s;hed to hear any-thing about him.</P>
<P>Well, but &s;till, my dear, there can be no harm to let Mr. Solmes tell you what Mr. Lovelace has &s;aid of <HI>you.</HI> Severely as you have treated Mr. Solmes, he is fond of attending you once more: He begs to be heard on this head.</P>
<P>If it be proper for me to hear it, Madam&mdash;</P>
<P>It <HI>is,</HI> eagerly interrupted &s;he, very proper.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="218">Has what he has &s;aid of <HI>me,</HI> Madam, convinced <HI>you</HI> of Mr. Lovelace's ba&s;ene&s;s?</P>
<P>It has, my dear: And that you ought to abhor him for it.</P>
<P>Then, dear Madam, be plea&s;ed to let me hear it from <HI>your</HI> mouth: There is no need that I &s;hould &s;ee Mr. <HI>Solmes,</HI> when it will have double the weight from <HI>you.</HI> What, Madam, has the man dared to &s;ay of <HI>me?</HI></P>
<P>My aunt was quite at a lo&s;s.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, Well, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;ee how you are attached I am &s;orry for it, Mi&s;s. For I do a&s;&s;ure you, it will &s;ignify nothing. You mu&s;t be Mrs. Solmes; and that in a very few days.</P>
<P>If con&s;ent of heart, and a&s;&s;ent of voice, be nece&s;|&s;ary to a marriage, I am &s;ure I never can, nor ever will be married to Mr. Solmes. And what will any of my relations be an&s;werable for, if they force my hand into his, and hold it there till the Service be read; I perhaps in&s;en&s;ible, and in fits, all the time?</P>
<P>What a romantic picture of a forced marriage have you drawn, niece! Some people would &s;ay, you have given a fine de&s;cription of your own ob&s;tinacy, child.</P>
<P>My brother and &s;i&s;ter would: But you, Madam di&s;tingui&s;h, I am &s;ure, between ob&s;tinacy and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ed aver&s;ion may owe its ri&s;e to real ob&s;tinacy my dear.</P>
<P>I know my own heart, Madam. I wi&s;h <HI>you</HI> did.</P>
<P>Well, but &s;ee Mr. Solmes, once more, niece. It wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> oblige, and make for you, more than you imagine.</P>
<P>What &s;hould I &s;ee him for, Madam?&mdash;Is the man fond of hearing me declare my aver&s;ion to him?&mdash;Is he de&s;irous of having me more and more incen&s;e my friends again&s;t my&s;elf?&mdash;O my cunning, my ambition brother!</P>
<P>Ah, my dear!&mdash;with a look of pity, as if &s;he under+&s;tood the meaning of my exclamation:&mdash;But mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> That nece&s;&s;arily be the ca&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="219">It mu&s;t, Madam, if they will take offence at me for declaring my &s;tedfa&s;t dete&s;tation of Mr. Solmes, as a hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Mr. Solmes is to be pitied, &s;aid &s;he. He adores you. He longs to &s;ee you once more. He loves you the better for your cruel u&s;age of him ye&s;terday. He is in raptures about you.</P>
<P>Ugly creature, thought I! He in raptures!&mdash;</P>
<P>What a cruel wretch mu&s;t He be, &s;aid I, who can enjoy the di&s;tre&s;s he &s;o largely contributes to!&mdash;But I &s;ee, I &s;ee, Madam, that I am con&s;ider'd as an animal to be baited, to make &s;port for my brother, and &s;i&s;ter, and Mr. Solmes. They are all, all of them, wanton in their cruelty.&mdash;<HI>I,</HI> Madam, &s;ee the man!&mdash;the man &s;o incapable of pity!&mdash;Indeed I won't &s;ee him, if I can help it.&mdash;Indeed I won't.</P>
<P>What a con&s;truction does your lively wit put upon the admiration Mr. Solmes expre&s;&s;es of you!&mdash;Pa&s;|&s;ionate as you were ye&s;terday, and contemptuou&s;ly as you treated him, he dotes upon you for the very &s;e|verity he &s;uffers by. He is not &s;o ungenerous a man as you think him: Nor has he an unfeeling heart.&mdash;Let me prevail upon you, my dear (as your <HI>father</HI> and <HI>mother</HI> expect it of you), to &s;ee him once more, and hear what he has to &s;ay to you.&mdash;</P>
<P>How can I con&s;ent to &s;ee him again, when ye&s;ter|day's interview was interpreted by you, Madam, as well as by every other, as an encouragement to him? When I my&s;elf declared, that if I &s;aw him a <HI>&s;econd</HI> time by my own con&s;ent, it might be &s;o taken? And when I am determined never to encourage him?</P>
<P>You might &s;pare your reflections upon <HI>me,</HI> Mi&s;s. I have no thanks either from one &s;ide, or the other.</P>
<P>And away &s;he flung.</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Madam! &s;aid I, following her to the door&mdash;</P>
<P>But &s;he would not hear me further; and her &s;ud|den breaking from me occa&s;ioned a hurry to &s;ome
<PB N="218" REF="220">
mean li&s;tener; as the &s;lipping of a foot from the land|ing-place on the &s;tairs di&s;covered to me.</P>
<P>I had &s;carcely recovered my&s;elf from this attack, when up came Betty, with a, Mi&s;s, your company is de&s;ired below-&s;tairs in your own parlour.</P>
<P>By whom, Betty?</P>
<P>How can I tell, Mi&s;s?&mdash;Perhaps by your &s;i&s;ter; perhaps by your brother&mdash;I know they won't come up-&s;tairs to your apartment again.</P>
<P>Is Mr. Solmes gone, Betty?</P>
<P>I believe he is, Mi&s;s:&mdash;Would you have him &s;ent for back, &s;aid the bold creature?</P>
<P>Down I went: And who &s;hould I be &s;ent for down to, but my brother and Mr. Solmes? The lat|ter &s;tanding &s;neaking behind the door, that I &s;aw him not, till I was mockingly led by the hand into the room by my brother. And then I &s;tarted as if I had beheld a gho&s;t.</P>
<P>You are to &s;it down, Clary.</P>
<P>And what then, brother?</P>
<P>Why, then, you are to put off that &s;cornful look, and hear what Mr. Solmes has to &s;ay to you.</P>
<P>Sent for down to be baited again, thought I!</P>
<P>Madam, &s;aid Mr. Solmes, as if in ha&s;te to &s;peak, le&s;t he &s;hould not have opportunity given him; and he judged right; Mr. Lovelace is a declared <HI>marriage-hater,</HI> and has a de&s;ign upon your honour, if ever&mdash;</P>
<P>Ba&s;e accu&s;er! &s;aid I, in a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;natching my hand from my brother, who was in&s;olently motion|ing to give it to Mr. Solmes; he has not!&mdash;he dares not! But <HI>you</HI> have! if endeavouring to force a free mind, is to di&s;honour it!</P>
<P>O thou violent creature! &s;aid my brother&mdash;But not gone yet&mdash;for I was ru&s;hing away.</P>
<P>What mean you, Sir (&s;truggling vehemently to get away), to detain me thus again&s;t my will?</P>
<P>You &s;hall not go, violence, cla&s;ping his unbro|therly arms about me.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221">Then let not Mr. Solmes &s;tay.&mdash;Why hold you me thus? He &s;hall not, for <HI>your own</HI> &s;ake, if I can help it, &s;ee how barbarou&s;ly a brother can treat a &s;i&s;ter, who de&s;erves not evil treatment.</P>
<P>And I &s;truggled &s;o vehemently to get from him, that he was forced to quit my hand; which he did with the&s;e words&mdash;Begone, then, Fury!&mdash;How &s;trong is will!&mdash;There is no holding her.</P>
<P>And up I flew to my chamber again, and locked my&s;elf in, trembling, and out of breath.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, up came Betty. I let her in, upon her tapping, and a&s;king (half out of breath too) for admittance.</P>
<P>The Lord have mercy upon us! &s;aid &s;he.&mdash;What a <HI>confu&s;ion of a hou&s;e</HI> is This!&mdash;Hurrying up and down, fanning her&s;elf with her handkerchief&mdash;Such angry ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es! Such an ob&s;tinate young lady!&mdash;Such an humble lover!&mdash;Such enraged un|cles!&mdash;Such&mdash;O dear! dear! What a top&s;y-turvy hou&s;e is This?&mdash;And all for what, trow?&mdash;Only be|cau&s;e a young Lady <HI>may</HI> be happy, and will <HI>not?</HI>&mdash;Only becau&s;e a young Lady <HI>will</HI> have a hu&s;band, and will <HI>not</HI> have a hu&s;band?&mdash;What hurly-burlies are here, where all u&s;ed to be peace and quietne&s;s?</P>
<P>Thus &s;he ran on, talking to her&s;elf; while I &s;at as patiently as I could (being a&s;&s;ured that her errand was not de&s;igned to be a welcome one to me), to ob&s;erve when her &s;oliloquy would end.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, turning to me&mdash;I mu&s;t do as I am bid: I can't help it&mdash;Don't be angry with me, Mi&s;s. But I mu&s;t carry down your pen and ink: And that, this moment.</P>
<P>By who&s;e order?</P>
<P>By your papa's and mamma's.</P>
<P>How &s;hall I know that?</P>
<P>She offered to go to my clo&s;et: I &s;tept in before her: Touch it, if you dare.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="222">Up came my cou&s;in Dolly&mdash;Madam!&mdash;Madam! &s;aid the poor weeping good-natured creature, in broken &s;entences&mdash;You mu&s;t&mdash;indeed you mu&s;t&mdash;deliver to Betty&mdash;or to me&mdash;your pen and ink.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I, my &s;weet cou&s;in? Then I will to you; but not to this bold body. And &s;o I gave my &s;tandi&s;h to her.</P>
<P>I am &s;orry, very &s;orry, &s;aid Mi&s;s, to be the me&s;|&s;enger: But your papa will not have you in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him: He is re&s;olved you &s;hall be carried away to-morrow, or Saturday at farthe&s;t. And there|fore your pen and ink is taken away, that you may give no-body notice of it.</P>
<P>And away went the dear girl very &s;orrowfully, carrying down with her my &s;tandi&s;h, and all its fur|niture, and a little parcel of pens be&s;ide, which hav|ing been &s;een when the great &s;earch was made, &s;he was bid to a&s;k for: As it happened, I had not di|mini&s;hed it, having half a dozen Crow-quills, which I had hid in as many different places. It was lucky; for I doubt not they had told how many were in the parcel.</P>
<P>Betty run on, telling me, that my mamma was now as much incen&s;ed again&s;t me, as any-body&mdash;That my doom was fixed!&mdash;That my violent be|haviour had not left one to plead for me. That Mr. Solmes bit his lip, and mumbled, and &s;eemed to have more in his head, than could come out at his mouth; that was her phra&s;e.</P>
<P>And yet &s;he al&s;o hinted to me, that the cruel crea|ture took plea&s;ure in &s;eeing me; altho' &s;o much to my di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;And &s;o wanted to &s;ee me again. Mu&s;t he not be a &s;avage, my dear?</P>
<P>The wench went on&mdash;That my uncle Harlowe &s;aid, That now <HI>he</HI> gave me up.&mdash;That he pitied Mr. Solmes&mdash;Yet hoped he would not think of This to my detriment hereafter: That my uncle Antony was of opinion, That I ought to &s;mart for it: <HI>And,</HI> for
<PB N="221" REF="223">
<HI>her</HI> part&mdash;And then, as one of the family, &s;he gave her opinion of the &s;ame &s;ide.</P>
<P>As I have no other way of hearing any thing that is &s;aid, or intended, below, I bear &s;ometimes more patiently, than I otherwi&s;e &s;hould do, with her im|pertinence. And, indeed, &s;he &s;eems to be in all my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's coun&s;els.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Hervey came up again, and demanded an half-pint ink-bottle, which they had &s;een in my clo&s;et.</P>
<P>I gave it her without he&s;itation.</P>
<P>If they have no &s;u&s;picion of my being able to write, they will, perhaps, let me &s;tay longer than otherwi&s;e they would.</P>
<P>This, my dear, is now my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>All my dependence, all my hopes, is in your mam|ma's favour. But for That, I know not what I might do: For who can tell what will come next?</P>

<P>I Am ju&s;t returned from depo&s;iting the letter I &s;o lately fini&s;hed, and &s;uch of Mr. Lovelace's letters as I had not &s;ent you. My long letter, I found remain|ing there.&mdash;So you'll have both together.</P>

Nor, if I choo&s;e to have it &s;o, will he appear to vi&s;it me; nor pre&s;ume to mention marriage to me till all is quiet and ea&s;y; till every method I &s;hall pre&s;cribe for a reconciliation with my friends, is try'd; till my cou&s;in comes; till &s;uch &s;ettlements are drawn, as he &s;hall approve of for me; and that I have unexceptionable proofs of his own good behaviour.'</Q></P>

Here is my young ma&s;ter&mdash;and my young mi&s;tre&s;s, coming, to take a walk in the garden; and your papa &s;ends me to &s;ee where you are, for fear he &s;hould meet you.</P>
<P>I &s;truck into an oblique path, and got behind the yew-hedge, &s;eeing my &s;i&s;ter appear; and there con|cealed my&s;elf till they were gone pa&s;t me.</P>
<P>My mamma, it &s;eems, is not well. My poor mamma keeps her chamber!&mdash;Should &s;he be wor&s;e, I &s;hould have an additional unhappine&s;s, in appre|hen&s;ion, that my reputed undutifulne&s;s has touched her heart!</P>

And yet, why was I &s;o affected; &s;ince I may be &s;aid to have been given up to their cruelty, for many days pa&s;t?</P>
<P>WHILE my papa remained in the garden, I &s;ent my dutiful compliments to my mamma, with inquiry after her health, by Shorey, whom I met accidentally upon the &s;tairs; for none of the &s;ervants, except my gaolere&s;s, dare to throw them&s;elves in my way. I had the mortification of &s;uch a return, as made me repent my me&s;&s;age, tho' not my concern for her health.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day Morning, April 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Have your three letters. Never was there a crea|ture more impatient on the mo&s;t intere&s;ting un|certainty than I was, to know the event of the in|terview between you and Solmes.</P>
<P>It behoves me to account to my dear friend, in her pre&s;ent unhappy &s;ituation, for every thing that may have the lea&s;t appearance of a negligence or remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, on my part. I &s;ent Robin in the morning early, in hopes of a depo&s;ite. He loiter'd about the place till near Ten, to no purpo&s;e; and then came away; my mamma having given him a letter to carry to Mr. Hunt's, which he was to deliver before Three, when only, in the day-time, that gentleman is at home; and to bring her back an an&s;wer to it. Mr. Hunt's hou&s;e, you know, lies wide from Harlowe-Place.&mdash;Robin but ju&s;t &s;aved his time; and return'd not till it was too late to &s;end him again. I could only direct him to &s;et out before day, this morning; and, if he got any letter, to ride, as for his life, to bring it to me.</P>
<P>I lay by my&s;elf; A mo&s;t unea&s;y night I had, thro' impatience; and being di&s;compo&s;ed with it, lay longer than u&s;ual. Ju&s;t as I was ri&s;en, in came Kitty, from
<PB N="230" REF="232">
Robin, with your three letters. I was not a quarter dre&s;s'd; and only &s;lipp'd on my morning &s;acque; pro|ceeding no further till (long as they are) I had read them all thro': And yet I often &s;topp'd to rave aloud (tho' by my&s;elf) at the devili&s;h people you have to deal with.</P>
<P>How my heart ri&s;es at them all! How poorly did they de&s;ign to trick you into an encouragement of Solmes, from the interview to which they had ex|torted your con&s;ent!&mdash;I am very, very angry at your aunt Hervey! To give up her own judgment &s;o tamely!&mdash;And not content with that, to become &s;uch an <HI>active</HI> in&s;trument in their hands.&mdash;But it is &s;o like the world!&mdash;So like my mamma too!&mdash;Next to her own child, there is not any-body living &s;he values &s;o much as &s;he does you:&mdash;Yet, it is&mdash;Why &s;hould we embroil our&s;elves, Nancy, with other peoples affairs?</P>
<P><HI>Other people!</HI>&mdash;How I hate the poor words, where friend&s;hip is concern'd, and where the protection to be given may be of &s;o much con&s;equence to a friend, and of &s;o little detriment to one's &s;elf!</P>
<P>I am delighted with your &s;pirit, however. I ex|pected it not from you. Nor did They, I am &s;ure. Nor would <HI>you,</HI> perhaps, have exerted it, if Lovelace's intelligence of Solmes's nur&s;ery-offices had not &s;et you up. I wonder not that the wretch is &s;aid to love you the better for it. What an honour to have &s;uch a wife? And he can be even with you when you are &s;o. He mu&s;t indeed be a &s;avage, as you &s;ay.&mdash;Yet is he le&s;s to blame for his per&s;everance, than tho&s;e of your own family, whom mo&s;t you reverence.</P>
<P>It is well, as I have often &s;aid, that I have not &s;uch provocations and trials; I &s;hould, perhaps, long ago, have taken your cou&s;in Dolly's advice&mdash;Yet dare I not to touch that key.&mdash;I &s;hall always love the good girl, for her tenderne&s;s to you.</P>
<P>I know not what to &s;ay to Lovelace; nor what to think of his promi&s;es, nor of his propo&s;als to you.
<PB N="231" REF="233">
'Tis certain that you are highly e&s;teem'd by all his family. The Ladies are per&s;ons of unblemi&s;hd ho|nour. My Lord M. is al&s;o, as Men and Peers go, a man of honour. I could tell what to advi&s;e any other per&s;on in the world to do but you. So much expected from you! Such a &s;hining light!&mdash;Your quitting your father's hou&s;e, and throwing your&s;elf into the protection of a family, however honourable, that has a Man in it, who&s;e per&s;on, parts, declara|tions, and preten&s;ions, will be thought to have en|gag'd your warme&s;t e&s;teem!&mdash;Methinks I am rather for advi&s;ing, that you &s;hould get privately to London; and not to let either him, or any-body el&s;e but me, know where you are, till your cou&s;in Morden comes.</P>
<P>As to going to your uncle's, that you mu&s;t not do, if you can help it. Nor mu&s;t you have Solmes, that's certain: Not only becau&s;e of his unworthine&s;s in every re&s;pect, but becau&s;e of the aver&s;ion you have &s;o openly avow'd to him; which every-body knows and talks of; as they do of your approbation of the other. For your reputation-&s;ake, therefore, as well as to prevent mi&s;chief, you mu&s;t either live &s;ingle, or have Lovelace.</P>
<P>If you think of going to London, let me know; and I hope you will have <HI>time</HI> to allow me a farther con|cert, as to the manner of your getting away, and thi|ther, and how to procure proper lodgings for you.</P>
<P>To obtain this <HI>time,</HI> you mu&s;t palliate a little, and come into &s;ome &s;eeming compromi&s;e, if you can|not do otherwi&s;e. Driven as you are driven, it will be &s;trange if you are not obliged to part with a few of your admirable punctilioes.</P>
<P>You will ob&s;erve from what I have written, that I have not &s;ucceeded with my mamma.</P>
<P>I am extremely mortify'd and di&s;appointed. We have had very &s;trong debates upon it. But, be&s;ides the narrow argument of <HI>embroiling our&s;elves with other peoples affairs,</HI> as above-mentioned, &s;he will have it,
<PB N="232" REF="234">
that it is your duty to comply. She &s;ays, &s;he was <HI>al|ways</HI> of opinion, that daughters <HI>&s;hould,</HI> and govern'd her&s;elf by it; for that my papa was, at fir&s;t, more her father's choice than her own.</P>
<P>This is what &s;he argues in behalf of her favourite Hickman, as well as for Solmes in your ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not doubt, but my mamma always govern'd her&s;elf by this principle, becau&s;e &s;he <HI>&s;ays</HI> &s;he did. I have likewi&s;e another rea&s;on to believe it; which you &s;hall have, tho' it may not become me to give it:&mdash;That they did not live &s;o very happily together, as one would hope people might, who married prefer|ring each other to the re&s;t of the world.</P>
<P>Somebody &s;hall fare never the better for this double-meant policy of my mamma, I will a&s;&s;ure him. Such a retro&s;pection in her arguments to him, and to his addre&s;s, it is but fit, that <HI>he</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer for <HI>my</HI> mor|tification in a point I had &s;o much &s;et my heart upon.</P>
<P>Think, my dear, if in any way I can &s;erve you. If you allow of it, I prote&s;t I will go off privately with you, and we will live and die together. Think of it. Improve upon my hint, and command me.</P>
<P>A little interruption. What is breakfa&s;t to the &s;ubject I am upon!</P>
<P>LONDON, I am told, is the be&s;t hiding-place in the world. I have written nothing but what I will &s;tand to at the word of command. Women love to engage in knight-errantry, now-and-then, as well as to encourage it in the men. But in your ca&s;e, what I propo&s;e, will have nothing in it of what can be deemed <HI>that.</HI> It will enable me to perform what is no more than a duty in &s;erving and comforting a dear and worthy friend, labouring under unde&s;erved op|pre&s;&s;ion: And you will <HI>ennoble,</HI> as I may &s;ay, your
<PB N="233" REF="235">
Anna Howe, if you will allow her to be your com|panion in affliction.</P>
<P>I'll engage, my dear, we &s;hall not be in town to|gether one month, before we &s;urmount all difficulties; and This without being beholden to any men-fellows for their protection.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t repeat what I have often &s;aid, That the authors of your per&s;ecutions would not have pre&s;umed to &s;et on foot their &s;elfi&s;h &s;chemes again&s;t you, had they not depended upon the gentlene&s;s of your &s;pirit: Tho' now, having gone &s;o far, and having engaged <HI>Old</HI> AUTHORITY in it [Chide me, if you will!] nei|ther <HI>he</HI> nor <HI>they</HI> know how to recede.</P>
<P>When they find you out of their reach, and know that I am with you, you'll &s;ee how they'll pull in their odious horns.</P>
<P>I think, however, that you &s;hould have written to your cou&s;in Morden, the moment they had begun to treat you di&s;gracefully.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be impatient to hear, whether they will at|tempt to carry you to your uncle's. I remember, that Lord M.'s di&s;mi&s;&s;ed bailiff reported of Lovelace, that he had &s;ix or &s;even companions as bad as him|&s;elf; and that the country was always glad when they left it. He <HI>has</HI> &s;uch a knot of them now, I hear, about him. And, depend upon it, he will not &s;uffer them quietly to carry you to your uncle's: And who&s;e mu&s;t you be, if he &s;ucceeds in taking you from them?</P>
<P>I tremble for you, but upon &s;uppo&s;ing what may be the con&s;equences of a conflict upon this occa&s;ion. To be &s;ure, he owes &s;ome of them vengeance. This gives me a double concern, that my mamma &s;hould refu&s;e her con&s;ent to the protection I had propo&s;ed, and &s;et my heart upon procuring, for you.</P>
<P>My mamma will not breakfa&s;t without me. A quarrel has its conveniencies &s;ometimes: Yet too much love, I think, is as bad as too little.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day, April 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Thank you, my deare&s;t friend, for the kind pains you have taken in accounting &s;o affectionately for my papers not being taken away ye&s;terday; and for the kind protection you would have procured for me, if you could.</P>
<P>This kind protection was what I wi&s;hed for: But my wi&s;hes, rai&s;ed at fir&s;t by your love, were rather govern'd by my de&s;pair of other refuge (having be|fore ca&s;t about, and not being able to determine, what I <HI>ought</HI> to do, and what I <HI>could</HI> do, in a &s;itua|tion &s;o unhappy) than by a rea&s;onable hope: For why, indeed, &s;hould any-body embroil them&s;elves for an|other, when they can avoid it?</P>
<P>All my con&s;olation is, as I have frequently &s;aid, that I have not, by my own inadvertence or folly, brought my&s;elf into this &s;ad &s;ituation. If I <HI>had,</HI> I &s;hould not have dared to look up to any-body with the expectation of protection or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor to you, for excu&s;e of the trouble I give you. But, never|thele&s;s, we &s;hould not be angry at a per&s;on's not do|ing that for our&s;elves, or for our friend, which &s;he thinks &s;he ought <HI>not</HI> to do; and which &s;he has it in her option to <HI>do,</HI> or to <HI>let alone.</HI> Much le&s;s have you a right to be di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;o prudent a mother, for not engaging her&s;elf &s;o warmly in my favour, as you wi&s;h'd &s;he would. If my own aunt can give me up, and that again&s;t her judgment, as I may pre&s;ume to &s;ay; and if my father, and mother, and uncles, who once loved me &s;o well, can join &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly again&s;t me; can <HI>I</HI> expect, or ought <HI>you,</HI> the protection of your mamma, in <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to them?</P>
<P>Indeed, my deare&s;t love [Permit me to be <HI>very</HI> &s;e|rious],
<PB N="236" REF="238">
I am afraid I am &s;ingled out, either for my own faults, or for the faults of my family, or for the faults of both, to be a very unhappy creature!&mdash;<HI>&s;ig|nally</HI> unhappy! For &s;ee you not how irre&s;i&s;tibly the waves of affliction come tumbling down upon me?</P>
<P>We have been till within the&s;e few weeks, every|one of us, too happy. No cro&s;&s;es, no vexations, but what we gave our&s;elves from the <HI>pamperdne&s;s,</HI> as I may call it, of our own wills. Surrounded by our heaps and &s;tores, hoarded up as fa&s;t as acquired, we have &s;eemed to think our&s;elves out of the reach of the bolts of adver&s;e fate. I was the pride of all my friends, proud <HI>my&s;elf</HI> of <HI>their</HI> pride, and glo|rying in my &s;tanding, who knows what the ju&s;tice of Heaven may inflict, in order to convince us, that we are not out of the reach of misfortune; and to reduce us to a better reliance, than That we have hitherto pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly made?</P>
<P>I &s;hould have been very little the better for the <HI>con|ver&s;ation-vi&s;its</HI> which the good Dr. Lewin u&s;ed to ho|nour me with, and for the principles <HI>wrought,</HI> as I may &s;ay, into my earlie&s;t mind by my pious Mrs. Norton, founded on her reverend father's experience, as well as on her own, if I could not thus retro&s;pect and argue, in &s;uch a &s;trange &s;ituation as we are in. <HI>Strange,</HI> I may well call it; for don't you &s;ee, my dear, that we &s;eem all to be <HI>impelled,</HI> as it were, by a perver&s;e fate, which none of us are able to re&s;i&s;t?&mdash;And yet all ari&s;ing (with a &s;trong appearance of &s;elf-puni&s;hment), from our&s;elves?&mdash;Do not my parents &s;ee the hopeful children, from whom they expected a perpetuity of worldly happine&s;s to their branching fa|mily, now grown up to an&s;wer the <HI>till</HI> now di&s;tant hope, &s;etting their angry faces again&s;t each other, pul|ling up by the roots, as I may &s;ay, that hope, which was ready to be carried into a probable certainty?</P>
<P>Your partial love will be ready to acquit me of ca|pital and intentional faults:&mdash;But oh, my dear! my
<PB N="237" REF="239">
calamities have humbled me enough, to make me turn my gaudy eye inward; to make me look into my|&s;elf!&mdash;And what have I di&s;cover'd there?&mdash;Why, my dear friend, more <HI>&s;ecret</HI> pride and vanity, than I could have thought had lain in my unexamined heart.</P>
<P>If <HI>I</HI> am to be &s;ingled out to be the <HI>puni&s;her</HI> of my&s;elf, and family, who &s;o lately was the <HI>pride</HI> of it, pray for me, my dear, that I may not be left wholly to my&s;elf; and that I may be enabled to &s;upport my character, &s;o as to be <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> acquitted of wilful and premeditated faults. The will of Providence be re&s;igned to in the re&s;t: As <HI>that</HI> leads, let me pa|tiently, and unrepiningly, follow!&mdash;I &s;hall not live al|ways!&mdash;May but my <HI>clo&s;ing</HI> &s;cene be happy!&mdash;</P>
<P>But I will not oppre&s;s you, my deare&s;t friend, with further reflections of this &s;ort. I will take them all into my&s;elf. Surely I have a mind, that has room for them. My afflictions are too &s;harp to la&s;t long. The cri&s;is is at hand. Happier times you bid me hope for. I <HI>will</HI> hope!</P>
<P>BUT yet, I cannot but be impatient at times, to find my&s;elf thus driven, and my character &s;o depreciated and &s;unk, that were all the <HI>future</HI> to be happy, I &s;hould be a&s;ham'd to &s;hew my face in public, or to look up. And all by the in&s;tigation of a &s;elfi&s;h bro|ther, and envious &s;i&s;ter!&mdash;</P>
<P>But let me &s;top: Let me reflect!&mdash;Are not the&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions the &s;ugge&s;tions of the <HI>&s;ecret</HI> pride I have been cen&s;uring? Then, <HI>already</HI> &s;o impatient! But this moment &s;o re&s;igned! &s;o much better di&s;po&s;ed for reflection!&mdash;Yet 'tis hard, 'tis very hard, to &s;ubdue an embitter'd &s;pirit!&mdash;In the in&s;tant of its trial too!&mdash;O my cruel brother!&mdash;But now it ri&s;es again!&mdash;I will lay down a pen I am &s;o little able to govern.&mdash;And I will try to &s;ubdue an impatience, which (if my afflictions are &s;ent me for corrective ends) may otherwi&s;e lead me into &s;till more puni&s;hable errors!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="240">I WILL return to a &s;ubject, which I cannot fly from for ten minutes together&mdash;called upon e&s;pecially as I am, by your three alternatives &s;tated in the conclu&s;ion of your la&s;t.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t; to wit, <HI>Your advice for me to escape to London</HI>&mdash;Let me tell you, that that other hint or propo&s;al which accompanies it, perfectly frightens me&mdash;Surely, my dear [happy as you are, and in|dulgently treated as your mamma treats you], you cannot mean what you propo&s;e! What a wretch mu&s;t I be, if I could, for <HI>one</HI> moment only, lend an ear to &s;uch propo&s;al as This!&mdash;<HI>I,</HI> to be the occa&s;ion of making &s;uch a mother's (perhaps <HI>&s;horten'd</HI>) life un|happy to the la&s;t hour of it!&mdash;<HI>Ennoble</HI> you, my dear creature! How mu&s;t &s;uch an enterprize [the ra&s;hne&s;s <HI>public,</HI> the motives, were they excu&s;able, <HI>private</HI>] deba&s;e you!&mdash;But I will not dwell upon the &s;ubject.&mdash;For your <HI>own</HI> &s;ake I will not.</P>
<P>As to your &s;econd alternative, <HI>To put my&s;elf into the protection of Lord M. and of the Ladies of that family,</HI> I own to you (as I believe I have owned before), that altho' to do This would be the &s;ame thing in the eye of the world, as putting my&s;elf into Mr. Lovelace's protection, yet, I think, I would do it, rather than be Mr. Solmes's wife, if there were evidently no other way to avoid being &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace, you have &s;een, propo&s;es to contrive a way to put me into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my own hou&s;e; and he tells me, that he will &s;oon fill it with the Ladies of his family, as my vi&s;itors;&mdash;upon my invitation, however, to them.&mdash;A very incon&s;iderate propo&s;al I think it to be, and upon which I cannot explain my&s;elf to him. What an exertion of independency does it chalk out for me! How, were I to attend to <HI>him</HI> (and not to the natu|ral con&s;equences which the following of his advice would lead me to) might I be drawn by <HI>gentle</HI> words, into the perpetration of the mo&s;t <HI>violent</HI> acts!&mdash;
<PB N="239" REF="241">
For how could I gain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but either by legal litigation, which, were I <HI>inclin'd</HI> to have recour&s;e to it [as I never can be], mu&s;t take up time; or by for|cibly turning out the per&s;ons whom my papa has placed there, to look after the gardens, the hou&s;e, and the furniture&mdash;per&s;ons intirely attached to him|&s;elf, and who, as I know, have been lately in&s;tructed by my brother?</P>
<P>Your third alternative, <HI>To meet and marry Love|lace directly</HI>: a man with who&s;e morals I am far from being &s;atisfy'd&mdash;A &s;tep, that could not be taken with the lea&s;t hope of ever obtaining pardon from, or re|conciliation with, any of my friends;&mdash;and again&s;t which a thou&s;and objections ri&s;e in my mind&mdash;That is not to be thought of.</P>
<P>What appears to me, upon the fulle&s;t deliberation, the mo&s;t eligible, if I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be thus driven, is the e&s;caping to London.&mdash;But I would forfeit all my hopes of happine&s;s in this life, rather than you &s;hould go off with me, as you ra&s;hly propo&s;e.&mdash;If I could get &s;afely thither, and be private, methinks I might remain ab|&s;olutely independent of Mr. Lovelace, and at liberty, either to make propo&s;als to my friends, or, &s;hould they renounce me (and I had no other or better way) to make terms with him; &s;uppo&s;ing my cou&s;in Morden, on his arrival, were to join with them. But they would, perhaps, <HI>then</HI> indulge me in my choice of a &s;ingle life, on giving him up: The renewing to them this offer, when I was at my own liberty, would at lea&s;t convince them, that I was in earne&s;t when I made it fir&s;t: And, upon my word, I <HI>would</HI> &s;tand to it, dear as you &s;eem to think, when you are di&s;po&s;ed to railly me, it would co&s;t me, <HI>to</HI> &s;tand to it.</P>
<P>If, my dear, you can procure a conveyance for us <HI>both,</HI> you can, perhaps, procure one for me <HI>&s;ingly</HI>; But can it be done without embroiling <HI>your&s;elf</HI> with your mamma, or <HI>her</HI> with our family?&mdash;Be it coach, chariot, chai&s;e, waggon, or hor&s;e, I matter not,
<PB N="240" REF="242">
provided You appear not in it. Only, in ca&s;e it be one of the two latter, I believe I mu&s;t de&s;ire you to get me an ordinary gown and coat, or habit, of &s;ome &s;ervant; having no concert with any of our own: The more ordinary the better. They may be thru&s;t into the wood-hou&s;e; where I can put them on; and then &s;lide down from the bank, that &s;eparates the wood-yard from the green lane.</P>
<P>But, alas! my dear, this, even <HI>this</HI> alternative, is not without difficulties, which &s;eem, to a &s;pirit &s;o little en|terprizing as mine, in a manner in&s;uperable. The&s;e are my reflections upon it:</P>
<P>I am afraid, in the fir&s;t place, that I &s;hall not have time for the requi&s;ite preparations to an e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Should I be either detected in tho&s;e preparations, or pur&s;ued and overtaken in my flight, and &s;o brought back, then would they think them&s;elves doubly war|ranted to compel me to have their Solmes: And, con|&s;cious, perhaps, of an intended fault, I &s;hould be le&s;s able to contend with them.</P>
<P>But were I even to get &s;afely to London, I know no-body there, but by name; and tho&s;e the trades|men to our family; who, no doubt, would be the fir&s;t wrote to, and engag'd, to find me out. And &s;hould Mr. Lovelace di&s;cover where I was, and he and my brother meet, what mi&s;chiefs might en&s;ue between them, whether I were willing, or not, to return to Harlowe-Place?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing I could remain there concealed, what might not my youth, my &s;ex, an unacquainted|ne&s;s with the ways of that great, wicked town, expo&s;e me to?&mdash;I &s;hould hardly dare to go to church, for fear of being di&s;cover'd. People would wonder how I lived. Who knows but I might pa&s;s for a kept mi|&s;tre&s;s; and that, altho' no-body came to me, yet, that every-time I went out, it might be imagined to be in pur&s;uance of &s;ome a&s;&s;ignation?</P>
<P>You, my dear, who alone would know where to
<PB N="241" REF="243">
direct to me, would be watched in all your &s;teps, and in all your me&s;&s;ages; and your mamma, at pre&s;ent not highly plea&s;ed with our corre&s;pondence, would then have rea&s;on to be <HI>more</HI> di&s;plea&s;ed; and might not differences follow between you, that would make me very unhappy, were I to know it? And this the more likely, as you take it &s;o unaccountably [and give me leave to &s;ay, &s;o ungenerou&s;ly] into your head, to re|venge your&s;elf upon the innocent Mr. Hickman for all the di&s;plea&s;ure your mamma gives you?</P>
<P>Were Lovelace to find out where I was; that would be the &s;ame thing, in the eye of the world, as if I had actually gone off with him: For (among &s;trangers, as I &s;hould be) he would not be prevailed upon to forbear vi&s;iting me: And his unhappy cha|racter [a fooli&s;h man!] is no credit to any young crea|ture, de&s;irous of concealment. Indeed, the world, let me e&s;cape whither, and to whom&s;oever, would conclude <HI>him</HI> to be at the bottom, and the contriver, of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the difficulties which ari&s;e to me on re|volving this &s;cheme; which, &s;ituated as I am, might appear &s;urmountable to a more enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit. If you, my dear, think them &s;urmountable, in any one of the ca&s;es put [and to be &s;ure I can take no cour&s;e, but what mu&s;t have <HI>&s;ome</HI> difficulty in it], be plea&s;ed to let me know your free and full thoughts upon it.</P>
<P>Had <HI>you,</HI> my dear friend, been married, then &s;hould I have had no doubt, but you and Mr. Hickman would have afforded an a&s;ylum to a poor creature, more than half lo&s;t, in her own apprehen&s;ion, for want of one kind, protecting friend!</P>
<P>You &s;ay, I &s;hould have written to my cou&s;in Mor|den the moment I was treated di&s;gracefully. But could I have believed that my friends would not have &s;often'd by degrees, when they &s;aw my antipathy to their Solmes?</P>
<P>I had thoughts indeed &s;everal times of writing to
<PB N="242" REF="244">
him. But by the time an an&s;wer could have come, I imagined all would have been over, as if it had ne|ver been:&mdash;So from day to day, from week to week, I hoped on: And, after all, I might as rea&s;onably fear (as I have heretofore &s;aid), that my cou&s;in would be brought to &s;ide again&s;t me, as that &s;ome of tho&s;e I have named, would.</P>
<P>And then to appeal to a <HI>cou&s;in</HI> [I mu&s;t have writ|ten with <HI>warmth,</HI> to engage him], again&s;t a <HI>father</HI>; This was not a de&s;irable thing to &s;et about! Then I had not, you know, one &s;oul of my &s;ide; my mamma her&s;elf again&s;t me: To be &s;ure he would have &s;u&s;|pended his judgment till he could have arrived.&mdash;He might not have been in ha&s;te to come, hoping the malady would cure it&s;elf: But <HI>had</HI> he written, his letters probably would have run in the qualifying &s;tyle; to per&s;uade <HI>me</HI> to &s;ubmit, or <HI>them</HI> only to relax: Had his letters been more on <HI>my</HI> &s;ide than on <HI>theirs,</HI> they would not have regarded them: Nor perhaps <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> had he come, and been an advocate for me: For you &s;ee how &s;trangely determined they are; how they have over-awed, or got in, every-body; &s;o that no one dare open their lips in my behalf: And you have heard, that my brother pu&s;hes his mea&s;ures with the more violence, that all may be over with me before my cou&s;in's expected arrival.</P>
<P>But you tell me, That, in order to gain time, I mu&s;t <HI>palliate</HI>; that I mu&s;t &s;eem to compromi&s;e with my friends.&mdash;But how <HI>palliate?</HI> how <HI>&s;eem</HI> to com|promi&s;e?&mdash;You would not have me endeavour to make them believe, that I will con&s;ent to what I ne|ver intend to con&s;ent to!&mdash;You would not have me try to gain time, with a view to <HI>deceive!</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>do evil, that good may come of it,</HI> is forbidden. And &s;hall I do evil, yet know not, whether good may come of it, or not?</P>
<P>Forbid it, Heaven! that Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe &s;hould have it in her thought to <HI>&s;erve,</HI> or even to <HI>&s;ave,</HI> her|&s;elf,
<PB N="243" REF="245">
at the expence of her &s;incerity, and by a <HI>&s;tudied</HI> deceit!</P>
<P>And is there, after all, no way to e&s;cape one great evil, but by plunging my&s;elf into another?&mdash;What an ill-fated creature am I?&mdash;Pray for me, my deare&s;t Nancy!&mdash;My mind is at pre&s;ent &s;o much di&s;turbed, that I hardly can for my&s;elf!&mdash;</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Thur&s;day Night.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE alarming hurry I mentioned under my date of la&s;t night, and Betty's &s;aucy, dark hints, come out to be owing to what I gue&s;s'd they were; that is to &s;ay, to the private intimation Mr. Lovelace con|trived our family &s;hould have of his in&s;olent re&s;o|lution [<HI>in&s;olent</HI> I mu&s;t call it] to prevent my being carried to my uncle's.</P>
<P>I &s;aw at the time, that it was as <HI>wrong,</HI> with re&s;pect to an&s;wering his own view, as it was <HI>in&s;olent:</HI> For could he think, as Betty (I &s;uppo&s;e from her betters) ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, That parents would be in&s;ulted out of their right to the di&s;po&s;al of their own child, by a violent man, whom they hate; and who could have no pre|ten&s;ion to di&s;pute that right with them, unle&s;s what he had from <HI>her,</HI> who had none over her&s;elf? And how mu&s;t this in&s;olence of his exa&s;perate them again&s;t me, emblazon'd, as my brother is able to emblazon it?</P>
<P>The ra&s;h man has indeed &s;o far gained his point, as to intimidate them from attempting to carry me away: But he has put them upon a &s;urer and a more de&s;perate mea&s;ure: And this has put me al&s;o upon one <HI>as</HI> de&s;perate; the con&s;equence of which, altho' he could not fore&s;ee it, may, perhaps, too well an|&s;wer
<PB N="244" REF="246">
his great end, little as he de&s;erves to have it an&s;wer'd.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I have done, as far as I know, the ra&s;he&s;t thing that ever I did in my life!</P>
<P>But let me give you the motive, and then the action will follow of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>About &s;ix o' clock this evening, my aunt [who &s;tays here all night; on my account, no doubt] came up, and tapp'd at my door; for I was writing, and had lock'd my&s;elf in. I open'd it; and &s;he entering, thus delivered her&s;elf:</P>
<P>I come once more to vi&s;it you, my dear; but &s;orely again&s;t my will; becau&s;e it is to impart to you mat|ters of the utmo&s;t concern to You, and to the whole family.</P>
<P>What, Madam, is now to be done with me? &s;aid I; wholly attentive.</P>
<P>You will not be hurried away to your uncle's, child; let that comfort you.&mdash;They &s;ee your aver&s;ion to go.&mdash;You will not be obliged to go to your uncle Antony's.</P>
<P>How you revive me, Madam! [I little thought what was to follow this &s;uppo&s;ed conde&s;cen&s;ion] This is a cordial to my heart!</P>
<P>And then I ran over with ble&s;&s;ings for this good news [and &s;he permitted me &s;o to do, by her &s;ilence]; congratulating my&s;elf, that I <HI>thought</HI> my papa could not re&s;olve to carry things to the la&s;t extre|mity&mdash;</P>
<P>Hold, niece, &s;aid &s;he, at la&s;t.&mdash;You mu&s;t not give your&s;elf too much joy upon the occa&s;ion neither.&mdash;Don't be &s;urpri&s;ed, my dear.&mdash;Why look you upon me, child, with &s;o affecting an earne&s;tne&s;s!&mdash;But you mu&s;t be Mrs. Solmes, for all that.</P>
<P>I was dumb.</P>
<P>She then told me, that they had had undoubted in|formation, that a certain de&s;perate <HI>ruffian</HI> [I mu&s;t excu&s;e her that word, &s;he &s;aid] had prepared armed
<PB N="245" REF="247">
men to way-lay my brother and uncles, and &s;eize me, and carry me off.&mdash;Surely, &s;he &s;aid, I was not con&s;ent|ing to a violence, that might be followed by murder, on one &s;ide, or the other; perhaps on both.&mdash;</P>
<P>I was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>That therefore my father (&s;till more exa&s;perated than before) had changed his re&s;olution as to my go|ing to my uncle's; and was determined next Tue&s;day to &s;et out thither <HI>him&s;elf</HI> with my mamma; and that (for it was to no purpo&s;e to conceal a re&s;olution &s;o &s;oon to be put in execution)&mdash;I mu&s;t not di&s;pute it any longer&mdash;on Wedne&s;day I mu&s;t give my hand&mdash;as they would have me.</P>
<P>She proceeded, That orders were already given for a licence: That the ceremony was to be performed in my own chamber, in pre&s;ence of all my friends, except of my father and mother; who would not re|turn, nor &s;ee me, till all was over, and till they had a good account of my behaviour.</P>
<P>The very intelligence, my dear!&mdash;the very intelli|gence This, which Lovelace gave me!</P>
<P>I was &s;till dumb&mdash;Only &s;ighing, as if my heart would break.</P>
<P>She went on comforting me, as &s;he thought. She laid before me the merit of obedience; and told me, that if it were my de&s;ire that my Mrs. Norton &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the ceremony, it would be complied with: That the plea&s;ure I &s;hould receive from re|conciling all my friends to me, and in their con|gratulations upon it, mu&s;t needs over-balance, with &s;uch a one as me, the difference of per&s;ons, how|ever preferable I might think the one man to the other: That Love was a fleeting thing, little better than a name, where morality and virtue did not di|&s;tingui&s;h the object of it: That a choice made by its dictates was &s;eldom happy; at lea&s;t not <HI>durably</HI> &s;o: Nor was it to be wonder'd at, when it naturally exalted the object above its merits, and made the lover blind to
<PB N="246" REF="248">
faults, that were vi&s;ible to every-body el&s;e: So that when a nearer intimacy &s;tript it of its imaginary per|fections, it left frequently both &s;ides &s;urprized, that they could be thus cheated; and that then the Indif|ference became &s;tronger than the Love ever was. That a woman gave a man great advantages, and in|&s;pired him with great vanity, when &s;he avowed her love for him, and preference of him, and was gene|rally requited with in&s;olence and contempt: Whereas the confe&s;&s;edly-obliged man, it was probable, would be all reverence and gratitude; and I cannot tell what.</P>
<P>You, my dear, &s;aid &s;he, believe you &s;hall be un|happy, if you have Mr. Solmes: Your parents think the contrary; and that you will be undoubtedly &s;o, were you to have Mr. Lovelace, who&s;e morals are unque&s;tionably bad:&mdash;Suppo&s;e it were your &s;ad lot to be unhappy with either, let me be&s;eech you to con|&s;ider, what great con&s;olation you will have on one hand, if you pur&s;ue your parents advice, that you did &s;o; what mortification on the other, that, by follow|ing your own, you have no-body to blame but your|&s;elf.</P>
<P>This, you remember, my dear, was an argument inforced upon me by Mrs. Norton.</P>
<P>The&s;e and other ob&s;ervations which &s;he made, were worthy of my aunt Hervey's good &s;en&s;e and experi|ence, and, applied to almo&s;t any young creature, who &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to her parents will, but one who had offered to make the &s;acrifices I have offered to make, ought to have had their due weight. But al|tho' it was ea&s;y to an&s;wer &s;ome of them in my own particular ca&s;e; yet, having over and over, to my mamma, <HI>before</HI> my confinement, and to my brother and &s;i&s;ter, and even to my aunt Hervey, <HI>&s;ince,</HI> &s;aid what I mu&s;t now have repeated, I was &s;o much mor|tified and afflicted at the cruel tidings &s;he brought me, that, however attentive I was to what &s;he &s;aid, I had neither power nor will to an&s;wer one word; and,
<PB N="247" REF="249">
had &s;he not &s;topp'd of her&s;elf, &s;he might have gone on an hour longer, without interruption from me.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving this, and that I only &s;at weeping, my handkerchief covering my face, and my bo&s;om heaving ready to bur&s;t; What! no an&s;wer, my dear?&mdash;Why &s;o much <HI>&s;ilent</HI> grief? You know <HI>I</HI> always loved you. You know, that <HI>I</HI> have no intere&s;t in this affair. You would not permit Mr. Solmes to acquaint you with &s;ome things which would have &s;et your heart again&s;t Mr. Lovelace. Shall I tell you &s;ome of the matters charged again&s;t him? Shall I, my dear?</P>
<P>Still I an&s;wered only by my tears and &s;ighs.</P>
<P>Well, child, you &s;hall be told the&s;e things after|wards, when you will be in a better &s;tate of mind to hear them, and to rejoice in the e&s;cape you will have had. It will be &s;ome excu&s;e, then, for you to plead for your behaviour to Mr. Solmes before marriage, that you could not have believed Mr. Lovelace had been &s;o very vile a man.</P>
<P>My heart flutter'd with impatience and anger at being &s;o plainly talked to as the wife of this man; but yet I then cho&s;e to be &s;ilent. If I had &s;poke, it would have been with vehemence.</P>
<P>Strange, my dear, &s;uch &s;ilence!&mdash;Your concern is infinitely more on this &s;ide the day, than it will be on the other.&mdash;But let me a&s;k you, and do not be di&s;plea|&s;ed, Will you choo&s;e to &s;ee what generous &s;tipu|lations for you there are in the &s;ettlements?&mdash;You have knowlege beyond your years&mdash;Give the writings a peru&s;al: Do, my dear.&mdash;They are ingro&s;&s;ed, and ready for &s;igning, and have been for &s;ome time.&mdash;Ex|cu&s;e me, my love,&mdash;I mean not to di&s;turb you:&mdash;Your papa would oblige me to bring them up, and to leave them with you. He commands you to read them.&mdash;<HI>But</HI> to read them, niece&mdash;&s;ince they are ingro&s;&s;ed, and were, before you made them ab&s;olutely hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>And then, to my great terror, out &s;he drew &s;ome parchments from her handkerchief, which &s;he had kept
<PB N="248" REF="250">
(unob&s;erved by me) under her apron, and, ri&s;ing, put them in the oppo&s;ite window. Had &s;he produced a &s;erpent, I could not have been more frighted.</P>
<P>Oh! my deare&s;t aunt, turning away my face, and holding out my hands: Hide from my eyes tho&s;e horrid parchments!&mdash;Let me conjure you to tell me! By all the tenderne&s;s of near relation-&s;hip, and upon your honour, and by your love for me, &s;ay, Are they ab&s;olutely re&s;olved, that, come what will, I mu&s;t be That man's?</P>
<P>My dear, you mu&s;t have Mr. Solmes: Indeed you mu&s;t.</P>
<P>Indeed I never will! This, as I have &s;aid over and over, is not originally my father's will.&mdash;Indeed I never will!&mdash;And that is All I will &s;ay!</P>
<P>It is your father's will <HI>now,</HI> reply'd my aunt: And con&s;idering how all the family is threatened by Mr. Lovelace, and the re&s;olution he has certainly taken to force you out of their hands; I cannot but &s;ay they are in the right, not to be bullied out of their child.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, then nothing remains for me to &s;ay. I am made de&s;perate. I care not what becomes of me!</P>
<P>Your piety, and your prudence, my dear, and Mr. Lovelace's immoral character, together with his dare|ing in&s;ults, and threatenings, which ought to incen&s;e <HI>you,</HI> as much as any-body, are every one's depen|dence. We are &s;ure the time will come, when you'll think very differently of the &s;teps your friends take to di&s;appoint a man who has made him&s;elf &s;o ju&s;tly obnoxious to them all.</P>
<P>She withdrew; leaving me full of grief and indig|nation:&mdash;And as much out of humour with Mr. Lovelace as with any-body; who, by his conceited contrivances, has made things wor&s;e for me than be|fore; depriving me of the hopes I had of gaining time to receive your advice, and private a&s;&s;i&s;tance to get to town; and leaving me no other choice, in all
<PB N="249" REF="251">
appearance, than either to throw my&s;elf upon his fa|mily, or to be made mi&s;erable for ever with Mr. Solmes. But I was &s;till re&s;olved to avoid both the&s;e evils, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I &s;ounded Betty in the fir&s;t place (whom my aunt &s;ent up, not thinking it proper, as Betty told me, that I &s;hould be left by my&s;elf, and who, I found, knew their de&s;igns) whether it were not probable that they would forbear, at my earne&s;t entreaty, to pu&s;h mat|ters to the threatened extremity.</P>
<P>But &s;he confirmed all my aunt &s;aid; rejoicing, (as &s;he &s;aid they All did) that the wretch had given them &s;o good a pretence to &s;ave me from him now, and for ever.</P>
<P>She run on about equipages be&s;poke; talked of my brother's and &s;i&s;ter's exultations, that now the whole family would &s;oon be reconciled to each other: Of the &s;ervants joy upon it: Of the expected licence: Of a vi&s;it to be paid me by Dr. Lewin, or another Clergyman, whom they named not to <HI>her</HI>; which was to crown the work: And of other preparations, &s;o particular, as made me dread that they de&s;igned to &s;urprize me into a &s;till nearer day than next Wedne&s;day.</P>
<P>The&s;e things made me exce&s;&s;ively unea&s;y. I knew not what to re&s;olve upon.</P>
<P>At one time, thought I, what have I to do, but to throw my&s;elf at once into the protection of Lady Betty Lawrance? But then, in re&s;entment of his <HI>fine</HI> contrivances, which had &s;o abominably di&s;concerted me, I &s;oon re&s;olved to the contrary. And at la&s;t concluded to a&s;k the favour of another half-hour's con|ver&s;ation with my aunt.</P>
<P>I &s;ent Betty to her with my reque&s;t.</P>
<P>She came.</P>
<P>I put it to her, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t manner, to tell me, whether I might not obtain the favour of a fort|night's re&s;pite?</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="252">She a&s;&s;ured me, It would not be granted.</P>
<P>Would a week? Surely a week would?</P>
<P>She believ'd a week might, if I would promi&s;e two things: The fir&s;t, upon my honour, not to write a line out of the hou&s;e, in that week: For it was &s;till &s;u&s;pected, &s;he &s;aid, that I found means to write to <HI>&s;ome-body.</HI> And, &s;econdly, to marry Mr. Solmes, at the expiration of it.</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible! Impo&s;&s;ible! I &s;aid with pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;What! might I not be obliged with one week, with|out &s;uch a horrid condition at the la&s;t?</P>
<P>She would go down, &s;he &s;aid, that &s;he might not &s;eem of her own head, to put upon me what I thought a hard&s;hip &s;o great.</P>
<P>She went down. And came up again.</P>
<P>Did I want, was the an&s;wer, to give the vile&s;t of men opportunity to put his murderous &s;chemes in ex|ecution?&mdash;It was time for them to put an end to my ob&s;tinacy (they were tired out with me) and to his hopes, at once. And an end <HI>&s;hould</HI> be put on Tue&s;|day or Wedne&s;day next, at furthe&s;t; unle&s;s I would give my honour to comply with the condition upon which my aunt had been <HI>&s;o good</HI> as to allow me a longer time.</P>
<P>I even &s;tamp'd with impatience!&mdash;I called upon her to witne&s;s, that I was guiltle&s;s of the con&s;equence of this compul&s;ion; This barbarous compul&s;ion, I called it; let that con&s;equence be what it would.</P>
<P>My aunt chid me, in an higher &s;train than ever &s;he did before.</P>
<P>While I, in a half frenzy, in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;eeing my Papa: Such u&s;age, I &s;aid, &s;et me above fear. I would rejoice to owe my death to him, as I did my life.</P>
<P>She own'd, that &s;he fear'd for my head.</P>
<P>I did go down half way of the &s;tairs, re&s;olved to throw my&s;elf at his feet, where-ever he was.&mdash;My
<PB N="251" REF="253">
aunt was frighted.&mdash;Indeed I was quite frenzical for a few minutes.&mdash;But hearing my brother's voice, as talking to &s;omebody, in my &s;i&s;ter's apartment ju&s;t by, I &s;topped; and heard the barbarous de&s;igner &s;ay, &s;peaking to my &s;i&s;ter, This works charmingly, my dear &s;i&s;ter!</P>
<P>It does! It does! &s;aid &s;he, in an exulting accent.</P>
<P>Let us keep it up, &s;aid my brother.&mdash;The villain is caught in his own trap!&mdash;Now &s;he mu&s;t be what we'd have her be.</P>
<P>Do You keep my father to it; I'll take care of my mamma, &s;aid Bella.</P>
<P>Never fear, &s;aid he!&mdash;And a laugh of congratu|lation to each other, and deri&s;ion of me, (as I made it out) quite turned my frenzical humour into a vin|dictive one.</P>
<P>My aunt, ju&s;t then coming down to me, and take|ing my hand, led me up; and try'd to &s;ooth me.</P>
<P>My raving was turned into &s;ullenne&s;s.</P>
<P>She preached patience and obedience to me.</P>
<P>I was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>At la&s;t &s;he de&s;ired me to a&s;&s;ure her, that I would offer no violence to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>God, I &s;aid, had given me more grace I hoped, than to be guilty of &s;o horrid a ra&s;hne&s;s. I was His creature, and not <HI>my own.</HI></P>
<P>She then took leave of me; and I in&s;i&s;ted upon her taking down with her the odious parchments.</P>
<P>Seeing me in &s;o ill an humour, and very earne&s;t that &s;he &s;hould take them with her, &s;he did; but &s;aid, That my papa &s;hould not know that &s;he did: And hoped I would better con&s;ider of the matter, and be calmer next time they were offer'd to my peru&s;al.</P>
<P>I revolved, after &s;he was gone, all that my brother and &s;i&s;ter had &s;aid: I dwelt upon their triumphings over me: And found ri&s;e in my mind a rancour, that I think I may &s;ay was new to me; and which I could
<PB N="252" REF="254">
not with&s;tand.&mdash;And putting every thing together, dreading the near day, what could I do?&mdash;Am I, in any manner excu&s;able for what I <HI>did</HI> do?&mdash;If I am condemned by the world, who know not my provocations, may I be acquitted by you?&mdash;If <HI>not,</HI> I am unhappy indeed.&mdash;For This I did.</P>
<P>Having &s;hook off Betty as &s;oon as I could, I wrote to Mr. Lovelace, to let him know,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That all that was threatened at my uncle Antony's, was intended to be executed <HI>here.</HI> That I had come to a re&s;olution to throw my&s;elf upon the protection of either of his two aunts, who would afford it me: In &s;hort, that by endeavouring to obtain leave, on Monday, to dine in the ivy-&s;ummer-hou&s;e, I would, if po&s;|&s;ible, meet him without the garden-door, at two, three, four, or five o'Clock on Monday afternoon, as I &s;hould be able. That in the mean time he &s;hould acquaint me, whether I might hope for ei|ther of tho&s;e Ladies protection:&mdash;And if &s;o, I ab&s;o|lutely in&s;i&s;ted, that he &s;hould leave me with either, and go to London him&s;elf, or remain at his uncle's; nor offer to vi&s;it me, till I were &s;atisfied, that nothing could be done with my friends in an amicable way; and that I could not obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my own e&s;tate, and leave to live upon it: And particularly, that he &s;hould not hint marriage to me, till I con|&s;ented to hear him upon that &s;ubject.&mdash;I added, that if he could prevail upon one of the Mi&s;&s;es Monta|gue to favour me with her company on the road, it would make me abundantly ea&s;ier in an enterprize which I could not think of (altho' &s;o driven) without the utmo&s;t concern; and which would throw &s;uch a flur upon my reputation in the eye of the world, as, perhaps, I &s;hould never be able to wipe off.'</Q></P>
<P>This was the purport of what I wrote; and down into the garden I &s;lid with it in the dark, which at another time I &s;hould not have had the courage to
<PB N="253" REF="255">
do, and depo&s;ited it, and came up again, unknown to any-body</P>
<P>My mind &s;o dreadfully mi&s;gave me when I re|turned, that to divert, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, my in|crea&s;ing unea&s;ine&s;s, I had recour&s;e to my private pen; and in a very &s;hort time ran this length.</P>
<P>And now, that I am come to this part, my unea&s;y reflections begin again to pour in upon me. Yet what can I do?&mdash;I believe I &s;hall take it back again the fir&s;t thing I do in the morning.&mdash;Yet what <HI>can</HI> I do?</P>
<P>For fear they &s;hould have an earlier day in their intention, than that which will too &s;oon come, I will begin to be very ill. Nor need I feign much; for indeed, I am extremely low, weak, and faint.</P>
<P>I hope to depo&s;ite this early in the morning for you, as I &s;hall return from re&s;uming my letter, if I do re|&s;ume it, as my <HI>inwarde&s;t</HI> mind bids me.</P>
<P>Altho' it is now near Two o'clock, I have a good mind to &s;lide down once more, in order to take back my letter. Our doors are always locked and barred up at a eleven; but the &s;eats of the le&s;&s;er hall win|dows being almo&s;t even with the ground without, and the &s;hutters not difficult to open, I could ea&s;ily get out.&mdash;</P>
<P>Yet why &s;hould I be thus unea&s;y?&mdash;Since, &s;hould the letter go, I can but hear what Mr. Lovelace &s;ays to it. His aunts live at too great a di&s;tance for him to have an immediate an&s;wer from them; &s;o I can &s;cruple going off till I have invitation. I can <HI>in|&s;i&s;t</HI> upon one of his cou&s;ins meeting me, as I have hinted, in the chariot; and he may not be able to obtain that favour from either of them. Twenty things may happen to afford me a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, at lea&s;t: Why &s;hould I be &s;o very unea&s;y?&mdash;When, too, I can re&s;ume it early, before it is probable he will have the thought of finding it there. Yet he owns he &s;pends three parts of his days, and has done for this fortnight pa&s;t, in loitering about in one di&s;gui&s;e or other, be|&s;ides
<PB N="254" REF="256">
the attendance given by his tru&s;ty &s;ervant, when he him&s;elf is not <HI>in waiting,</HI> as he calls it.</P>
<P>But the&s;e &s;trange fore-bodings!&mdash;Yet I can, if you advi&s;e, cau&s;e the chariot he &s;hall bring with him, to carry me directly for town, whither in my London &s;cheme, if you were to approve it, I had propo&s;ed to go: And This will &s;ave you the trouble of procuring for me a vehicle; as well as the &s;u&s;picion from your mamma of contributing to my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>But, &s;ollicitous for your advice, and approbation too, if I <HI>can</HI> have it, I will put an end to this letter.</P>

<P>MY aunt Hervey, who is a very early ri&s;er, was walking in the garden, (Betty attending her, as I &s;aw from my window this morning) when I aro&s;e; for, after &s;uch a train of fatigue and re&s;tle&s;s nights, I had unhappily over&s;lept my&s;elf: So all I dur&s;t venture upon, was, to &s;tep down to my poultry-yard, and depo&s;ite mine of ye&s;terday, and la&s;t night. And I am ju&s;t come up; for &s;he is &s;till in the garden: This prevents me from going to re&s;ume my letter, as I think &s;till to do; and hope it will not be too late.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I had unhappily over&s;lept my&s;elf. I went to bed at about half an hour after Two. I told the quarters till Five; after which I dropt a&s;leep, and awaked not till pa&s;t Six, and then in great terror from a dream, which has made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that, &s;lightly as I think of dreams, I can|not help taking this opportunity to relate it to you.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Methought my brother, my uncle Antony, and Mr. Solmes, had formed a plot to de&s;troy Mr.

Lovelace; who di&s;covering it, turned all his rage again&s;t me, believing I had a hand in it. I thought he made them all fly into foreign parts upon it; and afterwards &s;eizing upon me, carried me into a church-yard; and there, notwith&s;tanding all my prayers and tears, and prote&s;tations of innocence, &s;tabbed me to the heart, and then tumbled me in|to a deep grave ready dug, among two or three half-di&s;&s;olved carca&s;es; throwing in the dirt and earth upon me, with his hands, and trampling it down with his feet.'</Q></P>

<P>Now the letter is out of my power, I have more unea&s;ine&s;s and regret, than I had before.

<P>MY aunt has made me another vi&s;it. She began what &s;he had to &s;ay, with letting me know, That my friends are all per&s;uaded, that I &s;till corre&s;pond with Mr. Lovelace; as is plain, &s;he &s;aid, by hints and menaces he throws out, which &s;hews, that he is ap|prized of &s;everal things that have pa&s;&s;ed between my relations and me, &s;ometimes within a very little while after they have happened.</P>
<P>Altho' I approve not of the method he &s;toops to take to come at his intelligence, yet is it not prudent in me to clear my&s;elf by the ruin of the corrupted &s;ervant [as his vilene&s;s has neither my connivance, nor approbation], &s;ince my doing &s;o might occa&s;ion the detection of my own corre&s;pondence; and &s;o fru|&s;trate all the hopes I have to avoid this Solmes. Yet it is not at all unlikely, that this very agent of Mr. Lovelace plays booty between my brother and him: How el&s;e can <HI>our family</HI> know (&s;o <HI>&s;oon</HI> too) his menaces upon the pa&s;&s;ages they hint at?</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ured my aunt, that I was too much a&s;hamed of the treatment I met with, for every-one's &s;ake, as well as for my own, to acquaint Mr. Lovelace with the particulars of it, were the means of corre&s;ponding with him afforded me: That I had rea&s;on to think, that if he were to know of it from me, we mu&s;t be upon &s;uch terms, that he would not &s;cruple making &s;ome vi&s;its, which would give me great apprehen&s;ions. They all knew, I &s;aid, that I had no communication
<PB N="257" REF="259">
with any of my papa's &s;ervants, except my &s;i&s;ter's Betty Barnes: For altho' I had a good opinion of them all, and believed, if left to their own inclinations, they would be glad to &s;erve me; yet, finding by their &s;hy behaviour, that they were under particular di|rection, I had forborne ever &s;ince my Hannah had been &s;o di&s;gracefully di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, &s;o much as to &s;peak to any of them, for fear I &s;hould be the occa&s;ion of their lo&s;ing their places too: They mu&s;t, therefore, ac|count among <HI>them&s;elves</HI> for the intelligence Mr. Lovelace met with, &s;ince neither my brother, nor &s;i&s;ter, (as Betty had frequently, in prai&s;e of their &s;in|cerity, informed me) nor perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes, were at all careful who they &s;poke before, when they had any thing to throw out again&s;t him, or even again&s;t <HI>me,</HI> whom they took great pride to join with him on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>It was but too natural, my aunt &s;aid, for my friends to &s;uppo&s;e, that he had his intelligence, part of it at lea&s;t, from me; who, thinking my&s;elf hardly treated, might complain of it, if not to him, to Mi&s;s Howe; which, perhaps, might be the &s;ame thing; for they knew Mi&s;s Howe &s;poke as freely of them, as they could do of Mr. Lovelace; and mu&s;t have the par|ticulars &s;he &s;poke of, from &s;ome-body, who knew what was done here. That this determined my papa to bring the whole matter to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue, le&s;t fatal con&s;equences &s;hould en&s;ue.</P>
<P>I perceive you are going to &s;peak with warmth, pro|ceeded &s;he [And &s;o I was]&mdash;For my own part I am &s;ure, you would not write any thing, if you <HI>do</HI> write, to inflame &s;o violent a &s;pirit.&mdash;But this is not the end of my pre&s;ent vi&s;it.&mdash;</P>
<P>You cannot, my dear, but be convinced, that your father <HI>will</HI> be <HI>obeyed.</HI> The more you contend again&s;t his will, the more he thinks him&s;elf obliged to a&s;&s;ert his authority. Your mamma de&s;ires me to tell you, that if you will give her the lea&s;t hopes of
<PB N="258" REF="260">
a dutiful compliance, &s;he will be willing to &s;ee you in her clo&s;et ju&s;t now, while your papa is gone to take a walk in the garden.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hing per&s;i&s;tence, &s;aid I!&mdash;I am tired with making declarations and pleadings on this &s;ubject; and had hoped, that my re&s;olution being &s;o well known, I &s;hould not have been further urged upon it.</P>
<P>You mi&s;take the purport of my pre&s;ent vi&s;it, Mi&s;s [looking gravely]. Heretofore you have been <HI>de&s;ired</HI> and <HI>prayed,</HI> to obey and oblige your friends: <HI>Intreaty</HI> is at an end: They give it up. Now it is <HI>re&s;olved upon,</HI> that your father's will <HI>is to be obeyed</HI>; as it is fit it &s;hould. Some things are laid at your door, as if you concurred with Lovelace's threatened violence to carry you off; which your mamma will not be|lieve. She will tell you her own good opinion of you: She will tell you how much &s;he &s;till loves you: And what &s;he expects of you on the approaching oc|ca&s;ion: But yet, that &s;he may not be expo&s;ed to an oppo&s;ition, which would the more provoke her, &s;he de&s;ires, you will fir&s;t a&s;&s;ure her, that you go down with a re&s;olution to do that with a grace which mu&s;t be done with or without a grace. And be&s;ides, &s;he wants to give you &s;ome advice how to proceed, in or|der to reconcile your&s;elf to your papa, and to every-body el&s;e. Will you go down, Mi&s;s, or will you not?</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I &s;hould think my&s;elf happy, could I be ad|mitted to my mamma's pre&s;ence, after &s;o long a bani&s;hment from it; but that I could not wi&s;h it up|on tho&s;e terms.</P>
<P>And This is your an&s;wer, Mi&s;s?</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be my an&s;wer, Madam. Come what may, I never will have Mr. Solmes. I am very much con|cerned, that this matter is &s;o often pre&s;s'd upon me.&mdash;I never will have that man!</P>
<P>Down &s;he went with di&s;plea&s;ure. I could not help it. I was quite tired with &s;o many attempts, all to
<PB N="259" REF="261">
the &s;ame purpo&s;e. I am amazed that They are not!&mdash;So little variation! And no conce&s;&s;ion on either &s;ide!</P>
<P>I will go down and depo&s;ite this; for Betty has &s;een I have been writing. The &s;aucy creature took a napkin, and dipt it in water, and with a fleering air, Here, Mi&s;s; holding the wet corner to me.</P>
<P>What's That for, &s;aid I?</P>
<P>Only, Mi&s;s, one of the fingers of your right-hand, if you plea&s;e to look at it.</P>
<P>It was inky.</P>
<P>I gave her a look; but &s;aid nothing.</P>

<P>I Have a letter from Mr. Lovelace, full of tran&s;|ports, vows, and promi&s;es. I will &s;end it to you inclo&s;ed. You'll &s;ee how he engages in it for his aunt Lawrance's protection, and for Mi&s;s Charlotte Montague's accompanying me.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I have nothing to do, but to per&s;evere, he &s;ays, and prepare to receive the per&s;onal congratulations of his whole family.'</Q></P>
<P>But you'll &s;ee, how he pre&s;umes upon my being <HI>his,</HI> as the con&s;equence of throwing my&s;elf into that Lady's protection.</P>
<P>The chariot-and-fix is to be ready at the place he mentions. You'll &s;ee, as to the &s;lur upon my re|putation, which I am &s;o apprehen&s;ive about, how boldly he argues.

<P>How one &s;tep brings on another with this incroach|ing

Sex! How &s;oon may a young creature, who gives a man the lea&s;t encouragement, be carried beyond her intentions, and out of her own power!&mdash;You would imagine, by what he writes, that I have given him rea&s;on to think, that my aver&s;ion to Mr. Solmes is all owing to my favour for him!</P>
<P>The dreadful thing is, that, comparing what he writes from his intelligencer, of what is de&s;igned again&s;t me [though he &s;eems not to know the threatened day] with what my aunt and Betty a&s;&s;ure me of, there can be no hope for me, but that I mu&s;t be Solmes's wife, if I &s;tay here.</P>
<P>I had better have gone to my uncle Antony's, at this rate! I &s;hould have gained time, at lea&s;t, by it. This is the fruit of his fine contrivances!</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'What we are to do, and how good he is to be: How I am to direct all his future &s;teps.'</Q>
All this &s;hews, as I &s;aid before, that he is &s;ure of me.</P>
<P>However, I have reply'd to the following effect:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That although I had given him room to expect, that I would put my&s;elf into his aunt's protection; yet, as I have three days to come, between this and Monday, and as I hope that my friends will still re|lent, or that Mr. Solmes will give up a point they will both find it impo&s;&s;ible to carry; I &s;hall not look upon my&s;elf as ab&s;olutely bound by the appointment: And expect therefore, if I recede, that I &s;hall not be called to account for it by him.

approbation of my future &s;teps; and that I will govern my&s;elf intirely by his commands, in every (rea&s;onable point, as much as if I had not left his hou&s;e: That if he imagines, that I &s;hall not re|&s;erve to my&s;elf this liberty, but that my withdraw|ing is to give him any advantages, which he would otherwi&s;e have had; I am determined to tarry where I am, and abide the event, in hopes that my friends will &s;till accept of my reiterated promi&s;e, never to marry him, or any-body el&s;e, without their con&s;ent.'</Q></P>

<P>Betty has told them I am very much indi&s;po&s;ed. But I have no pity from any-body.</P>
<P>I believe, I am become the object of every-one's aver&s;ion; and that they would all be glad I were dead.&mdash;Indeed, I believe it!&mdash;

<P>MY aunt, who again &s;tays all night, has ju&s;t left me. She came to tell me the re&s;ult of my friends deliberations about me. It is this.</P>
<P>Next Wedne&s;day morning they are all to be a&s;|&s;embled: To wit, my father, mother, my uncles, her&s;elf, and my uncle Hervey; my brother and &s;i&s;ter of cour&s;e; my good Mrs. Norton is likewi&s;e to be admitted: And Dr. Lewin is to be at hand, to ex|hort me, it &s;eems, if there be occa&s;ion: But my aunt is not certain, whether he is to be among them, or to tarry till called in.</P>
<P>When this awful court is &s;et, the poor pri&s;oner is to be brought in, &s;upported by Mrs. Norton; who is to be fir&s;t tutored to in&s;truct me in the duty of a child; which, it &s;eems, I have quite forgotten.</P>
<P>Nor is the &s;ucce&s;s at all doubted, my aunt &s;ays: For it is not believed I can be &s;o harden'd, as to with&s;tand &s;o venerable a judicature, altho' I have with&s;tood &s;everal of them &s;eparately. And &s;till the le&s;s, as &s;he hints at extraordinary conde&s;cen&s;ions from my papa. But what conde&s;cen&s;ions, from even my father, can induce me to make &s;uch a &s;acrifice as is expected from me?</P>
<P>Yet my &s;pirits will never bear up, I doubt, at &s;uch a tribunal: My father pre&s;iding in it.</P>
<P>I believed indeed, that my trials would not be at an end, till he had admitted me once more into his awful pre&s;ence!</P>
<P>What is hoped from me, &s;he &s;ays, is, That I
<PB N="263" REF="265">
will chearfully, on Tue&s;day night, if not before, &s;ign the articles; and &s;o turn the &s;ucceeding day's &s;olemn convention of all my friends, into a day of fe&s;tivity, I am to have the licence &s;ent me up, how|ever, and once more the &s;ettlements, that I may &s;ee how much in earne&s;t they are.</P>
<P>She further hinted, that my papa him&s;elf would bring up the &s;ettlements for me to &s;ign.</P>
<P>O my dear! what a trial will This be!&mdash;How &s;hall I be able to refu&s;e to my father [My father! from who&s;e pre&s;ence I have been &s;o long bani&s;h'd; he commanding and intreating, perhaps, in a breath! How &s;hall I be able to refu&s;e to my father] the writing of my name?</P>
<P>They are &s;ure, &s;he &s;ays, &s;omething is working on Mr. Lovelace's part, and perhaps on mine: And my papa would &s;ooner follow me to the grave, than &s;ee me <HI>his</HI> wife.</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I was not well; That the very apprehen|&s;ions of the&s;e trials, were already in&s;upportable to me; and would increa&s;e upon me, as the time ap|proached; and I was afraid I &s;hould be extremely ill.</P>
<P>They had prepared them&s;elves for &s;uch an <HI>artifice</HI> as That, was my aunt's unkind word; and &s;he could a&s;&s;ure me, it would &s;tand me in no &s;tead.</P>
<P><HI>Artifice!</HI> repeated I: And this from my aunt Hervey?</P>
<P>Why my dear, &s;aid &s;he, do you think people are fools?&mdash;Can they not &s;ee, how di&s;mally you endea|vour to &s;igh your&s;elf down within-doors?&mdash;How you hang down your <HI>&s;weet face</HI> [tho&s;e were the words &s;he was plea&s;ed to u&s;e] upon your bo&s;om:&mdash;How you totter, as it were, and hold by this chair, and by that door-po&s;t, when you know that Any-body &s;ees you [This, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, is an a&s;per&s;ion to fa&s;ten hypocri&s;y and contempt upon me: My bro|ther's or &s;i&s;ter's a&s;per&s;ion!&mdash;I am not capable of arts

&s;o low]. But the moment you are down with your poultry, or advancing upon your garden-walk, and, as you imagine, out of every-body's &s;ight, it is &s;een how nimbly you trip along; and what an alertne&s;s governs all your motions.</P>
<P>I &s;hould hate my&s;elf, &s;aid I, were I capable of &s;uch poor <HI>artifices</HI> as the&s;e. I mu&s;t be a fool to u&s;e them, as well as a mean creature; for have I not had ex|perience enough, that my friends are incapable of being moved in much more <HI>affecting in&s;tances?</HI>&mdash;But you'll &s;ee how I &s;hall be by Tue&s;day.</P>
<P>My dear, you will not offer any violence to your health?&mdash;I hope, God has given you more grace, than to do that.</P>
<P>I hope he has, Madam. But there is violence enough offer'd, and threatened, to affect my health; and that will be found, without my needing to have recour&s;e to any other, or to <HI>artifice</HI> either.</P>
<P>I'll only tell you one thing, my dear: And that is; Ill or well, the ceremony will probably be performed before Wedne&s;day-night:&mdash;But This, al&s;o, I will tell you, altho' beyond my pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ion, that Mr. Solmes will be under an engagement, (if you &s;hould require it of him, as a favour) after the cere|mony is pa&s;&s;ed, and Lovelace's hopes thereby utterly extingui&s;hed, to leave you at your father's, and re|turn to his own hou&s;e every evening, until you are brought to a full &s;en&s;e of your duty, and con&s;ent to acknowlege your change of name.</P>
<P>There was no opening of my lips to &s;uch a &s;peech as This. I was dumb.</P>
<P>And the&s;e, my dear Mi&s;s Howe, are They, who <HI>&s;ome</HI> of them, at lea&s;t, have called me a romantic girl!&mdash;This is my chimerical brother, and wi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;i&s;ter; both joining their heads together, I dare &s;ay&punc; And yet, my aunt told me, that the la&s;t part wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what took in my mamma; who had, till that wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tarted, in&s;i&s;ted, that her child &s;hould not be married

if, thro' grief or oppo&s;ition, &s;he &s;hould be ill, or fall into fits.</P>

<P>AND now, my dear, what &s;hall I conclude upon? You &s;ee how determin'd&mdash;But how can I expect your advice will come time enough to &s;tand me in any &s;tead? For here, I have been down, and already have another letter from Mr. Lovelace [The man lives upon the &s;pot, I think]: And I mu&s;t write to him, either that I will, or will not, &s;tand to my fir&s;t re&s;olution of e&s;caping hence on Monday next. If I let him know, that I will not (appearances &s;o &s;trong <HI>again&s;t</HI> him, and <HI>for</HI> Solmes, even &s;tronger, than when I made the appointment), will it not be ju&s;tly deemed my own fault, if I am compelled to marry their odious man? And if any mi&s;chief en&s;ue from Mr. Lovelace's rage and di&s;appointment, will it not lie at my door?&mdash;Yet, he offers &s;o fair!&mdash;Yet, on the other hand, to incur the cen&s;ure of the world, as a giddy creature!&mdash;But that, as he hints, I have al|ready incurred!&mdash;What can I do? Oh! that my cou&s;in Morden!&mdash;But what &s;ignifies wi&s;hing?</P>
<P>I will here give you the &s;ub&s;tance of Mr. Love|lace's letter. The letter it&s;elf I will &s;end, when I have an&s;wered it; but that I will defer doing as long as I can, in hopes of finding rea&s;on to retract an ap|pointment on which &s;o much depends. And yet it is nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould have all before you, as I go
<PB N="266" REF="268">
along, that you may be the better able to advi&s;e me in this dreadful cri&s;is of my fate.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He begs my pardon, for writing with &s;o much a&s;|&s;urance; attributing it to his unbounded tran&s;port; and intirely acquie&s;ces in my will. He is full of alternatives and propo&s;als. He offers to attend me directly to Lady Betty's; or, if I had rather, to my own e&s;tate; and that my Lord M. &s;hall pro|tect me there, [He knows not, my dear, my rea&s;ons for rejecting this incon&s;iderate advice]. In either ca&s;e, as &s;oon as he &s;ees me &s;afe, he will go up to London, or whither I plea&s;e; and not come near me, but by my own permi&s;&s;ion; and till I am &s;a|tisfy'd in every thing I am doubtful of, as well with regard to his reformation, as to &s;ettlements, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'To conduct me to You, my dear, is another of his alternatives, not doubting, he &s;ays, but your mamma will receive me. Or, if That be not agree|able to you, to your mamma, or to me, he will put me into Mr. Hickman's protection; whom, no doubt, Mi&s;s Howe can influence; and that it may be given out, that I am gone to Bath, or Bri&s;tol, or Abroad; where-ever I plea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Again, If it be more agreeable, he propo&s;es to attend me privately to London, where he will pro|cure hand&s;ome lodgings for me, and both his cou&s;ins Montague to receive me there, and to accompany me till all &s;hall be adju&s;ted to my mind; and till a reconciliation &s;hall be effected; which, he a&s;&s;ures me, nothing &s;hall be wanting in him to facilitate; greatly as he has been in&s;ulted by all my family.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'The&s;e &s;everal mea&s;ures he propo&s;es to my choice; it being unlikely, he &s;ays, that he can procure in the time, a letter from Lady Betty, under her own hand, inviting me in form to her hou&s;e, un|le&s;s he had been him&s;elf to go to that Lady for it; which, at this critical conjuncture, while he is at|tending my commands, is impo&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'However, in&s;tead of threatening my relations, or Solmes, if I recede, he re&s;pectfully &s;ays, that he doubts not, but that, if I do, it will be upon &s;uch rea&s;ons, as he ought to be &s;atisfy'd with; upon no &s;lighter, he hopes, than their leaving me at full liberty to pur&s;ue my own inclinations: In which (whatever they &s;hall be), he will intirely acquie&s;ce; only endea|vouring to make his future good behaviour, the &s;ole ground for his expectation of my favour.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'In &s;hort, he &s;olemnly vows, that his <HI>whole</HI> view at pre&s;ent, is, To free me from my impri&s;onment; and to re&s;tore me to my own free-will, in a point &s;o ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to my future happine&s;s.

But that, neverthele&s;s, as to the world's opinion, it is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine, that the behaviour of my relations to me, has not already brought upon my family tho&s;e free cen&s;ures which they de&s;erve, and cau&s;ed the &s;tep which I am &s;o &s;crupulous about taking, to be no other than the natural and expected con&s;equence of their treatment of me.'</Q></P>
<P>Indeed, I am afraid all this is true: And it is owing to &s;ome little degree of politene&s;s, that Mr. Lovelace does not &s;ay all he might &s;ay on this &s;ubject: For I have no doubt, that I am the talk, and perhaps the by-word of half the county. If &s;o, I am afraid, I can now do nothing that will give me more di&s;grace than I have already &s;o cau&s;ele&s;ly received by their indi&s;creet per&s;ecutions: And let me be who&s;e I will, and do what I will, I &s;hall never wipe off the &s;tain my con|finement,
<PB N="268" REF="270">
and the rigorous u&s;age I have received, have fixed upon me; at lea&s;t in my own opinion.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, if ever I am to be con&s;idered as one of the eminent family this man is ally'd to, &s;ome of them do not think the wor&s;e of me, for the di&s;grace I have re|ceived!&mdash;In that ca&s;e, perhaps, I &s;hall be obliged to him, if <HI>he</HI> do not. You &s;ee how much this har&s;h, this cruel, treatment from my own family has hum|bled me!&mdash;But, perhaps, I was too much exalted before.</P>
<P>Mr. Lovelace concludes,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'with repeatedly begging an interview with me; and That, <HI>this</HI> night, if po&s;|&s;ible: An honour, he &s;ays, he is the more encour|aged to &s;olicit for, as I had twice before made him hope for it. But whether he obtain it, or not, he be&s;eeches me to choo&s;e one of the alternatives he of|fers to my acceptance; and not to depart from my re&s;olution of e&s;caping on Monday, unle&s;s the rea&s;on cea&s;es on which I had taken it up; and that I have a pro&s;pect of being re&s;tored to my friends favour; at lea&s;t to my own liberty and freedom of choice.'</Q></P>
<P>He renews all his vows and promi&s;es on this head, in &s;o earne&s;t and &s;o &s;olemn a manner, that (his own intere&s;t, and his family's honour, and their favour for me, co-operating) I can have no room to doubt of his &s;incerity.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Morn, 8 o' Clock, April 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHether you will blame me, or not, I cannot tell, But I have depo&s;ited a letter confirming my former re&s;olution to leave this hou&s;e on Monday next, within the hours, if po&s;&s;ible, prefixed in my former. I have not kept a copy of it. But this is the &s;ub|&s;tance:</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="271">I tell him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I have no way to avoid the de|termin'd re&s;olution of my friends in behalf of Mr. Solmes; but by abandoning this hou&s;e by his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance.'</Q></P>
<P>I have not pretended to make a merit with him on this &s;core; for I plainly tell him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That could I, without an unpardonable &s;in, the when I <HI>would,</HI> I would &s;ooner make death my choice, than take a &s;tep, which all the world, if not my own heart, will condemn me for taking.'</Q></P>
<P>I tell him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I &s;hall not try to bring any other cloaths with me, than tho&s;e I &s;hall have on; and tho&s;e but my common wearing-apparel; le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected. That I mu&s;t expect to be de|ny'd the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my e&s;tate: But that I am de|termin'd never to con&s;ent to a litigation with my fa|ther, were I to be reduced to ever &s;o low a &s;tate: So that the protection I am to be obliged for, to any one, mu&s;t be alone for the di&s;tre&s;s-&s;ake: And yet, that I have too much pride to think of marrying, until I have a fortune that &s;hall make me appear upon a foot of equality with, and void of obligation to, any-body: That, therefore, he will have no|thing to hope for from this &s;tep, that he had not be|fore: And that, in every light, I re&s;erve to my&s;elf to accept or refu&s;e his addre&s;s, as his behaviour and cir+cum&s;pection &s;hall appear to me to de&s;erve.'</Q></P>
<P>I tell him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I think it be&s;t to go into a pri+vate lodging, in the neighbourhood of his aunt Law|rance; and not to her hou&s;e; that it may not ap|pear to the world, that I have refuged my&s;elf in his family; and that a reconciliation with my friends, may not, on that account, be made impracticable: That I will &s;end for thither my faithful Hannah; and apprize only Mi&s;s Howe where I am: That he &s;hall in&s;tantly leave me, and go to London, or to one of his uncle's &s;eats; and (as he had promi&s;ed)
<PB N="270" REF="272">
not come near me, but by my leave; contenting him&s;elf with a corre&s;pondence by letter only.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That if I find my&s;elf in danger of being di&s;co|vered, and carried back by violence, I will then throw my&s;elf directly into the protection of either of his aunts, who will receive me: But This only in ca&s;e of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity; for that it will be more to my reputation, for me, by the be&s;t means I can, (taking advantage of my privacy) to enter by a &s;e|cond or third hand into a treaty of reconciliation with my friends.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I mu&s;t, however, plainly tell him, That if, in this treaty, my friends in&s;i&s;t upon my re&s;olve|ing again&s;t marrying him, I will engage to comply with them; provided they will allow me to promi&s;e him, that I will never be any other man's, while he remains &s;ingle, or is living: That this is a com|pliment I am willing to pay to him, in return for the trouble and pains he has taken, and the u&s;age he has met with, on my account: Altho' I intimate, that he may, in a great mea&s;ure, thank him&s;elf, and the little regard he has paid to his reputation; for the &s;lights he has met with.'</Q></P>
<P>I tell him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I may, in this privacy, write to my cou&s;in Morden, and, if po&s;&s;ible, intere&s;t him in my cau&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I take &s;ome brief notice of his alternatives.'</Q></P>
<P>You mu&s;t think, my dear, that this unhappy force upon me, and this projected flight, makes it nece&s;|&s;ary for me to account to him much &s;ooner than it agrees with my &s;tomach to do, for every part of my conduct.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'It is not to be expected, I tell him, that your mamma will embroil her&s;elf, or &s;uffer you, or Mr. Hickman to be embroiled, on my account: And as to his propo&s;al of my going to London, I am &s;uch an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to every-body there, and have
<PB N="271" REF="273">
&s;uch a bad opinion of the place, that I cannot by any means think of going thither; except I &s;hould be induced, &s;ome time hence, by the Ladies of his family to attend them.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'As to the meeting he is de&s;irous of, I think it by no means proper; e&s;pecially as it is &s;o likely that I may &s;oon &s;ee him. But that if any thing occurs to induce me to change my mind, as to withdrawing, I may then, very probably, take the fir&s;t opportu|nity to &s;ee him, and give him my rea&s;ons for that change.'</Q></P>
<P>This, my dear, I the le&s;s &s;crupled to write, that I might qualify him for &s;uch a di&s;appointment, &s;hould I give it; he having, be&s;ides, behaved &s;o very unex|ceptionably, when he &s;urprized me &s;ome time ago in the lonely woodhou&s;e.</P>
<P>Finally,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'I commend my&s;elf, as a per&s;on in di|&s;tre&s;s, and merely as &s;uch, to <HI>his</HI> honour, and to his <HI>aunt</HI>'s protection. I repeat [mo&s;t cordially, I am &s;ure!] my deep concern for being forced to take a &s;tep &s;o di&s;agreeable, and &s;o derogatory to my honour. And having told him, that I will endea|vour to obtain leave to dine in the Ivy &s;ummer-hou&s;e <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><P>The <HI>Ivy &s;ummer-hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Ivy bower,</HI> as it was &s;ometimes cal|led in the family, was a place, that from a girl, this young Lady de|lighted in.

<P>She de&s;cribes it, in another letter, as
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'angularly pointing to a pretty variegated land&s;chape of wood, water, and hilly country; which had plea&s;ed her &s;o much, that &s;he had drawn it; the piece hanging up, in her parlour, among &s;ome of her other drawings.'</Q></P></NOTE>, and to &s;end Betty of &s;ome errand, when there, I leave the re&s;t to him; but imagine, that about four o' clock will be a proper time for him to contrive &s;ome &s;ignal to let me know he is at hand, and for me to unbolt the garden-door.'</Q></P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday, Ten o' Clock.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>Mr. Solmes is here. He is to dine with his new relations, as Betty tells me he already calls them.</P>
<P>He would have thrown him&s;elf in my way, once more: But I hurry'd up to my pri&s;on, in my return from my garden-walk, to avoid him.</P>
<P>I had, when in the garden, the curio&s;ity to &s;ee, if my letter were gone: I cannot &s;ay, with an intention to take it back again, if it had not; becau&s;e I &s;ee not how I could do otherwi&s;e than I have done. Yet what a caprice was this!&mdash;For when I found it gone, I began (as ye&s;terday-morning) to wi&s;h it had not: For no other rea&s;on, I believe, than becau&s;e it was out of my power.</P>
<P>A &s;trange diligence in this man!&mdash;He <HI>&s;ays,</HI> he al|mo&s;t lives upon the place; and I think &s;o too.</P>
<P>He mentions, as you will &s;ee in his letter, four &s;everal di&s;gui&s;es, which he put on in one day. It is a wonder, neverthele&s;s, that he has not been &s;een by &s;ome of our tenants: For it is impo&s;&s;ible that any di&s;|gui&s;e can hide the gracefulne&s;s of his figure. But this is to be &s;aid, that the adjoining grounds being all in our own hands, and no common foot-paths near that part of the garden, and thro' the park and coppice, nothing can be more bye and unfrequented.</P>
<P>Then they are le&s;s watchful, I believe, over my
<PB N="273" REF="275">
garden-walks, and my poultry-vi&s;its, depending, as my aunt hinted, upon the bad character they have taken &s;o much pains to fa&s;ten upon Mr. Lovelace. This, they think (and ju&s;tly think), mu&s;t fill me with doubts. And then the regard I have hitherto had for my reputation, is another of their &s;ecurities. Were it not for the&s;e two, they would not &s;urely have u&s;ed me as they have done; and at the &s;ame time left me the opportunities, which I have &s;everal times had, to get away, had I been di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;o <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">They might, no doubt, make a dependence upon the rea&s;ons &s;he gives: But their chief reliance was upon the vigilance of their Jo&s;eph Leman; little imagining, what an implement he was of Mr. Love|lace.</NOTE>: And indeed, their dependencies on both the&s;e motives would have been well founded, had they kept but tolerable mea&s;ures with me.</P>
<P>Then, perhaps, they have no notion of the back-door; as it is &s;eldom open'd, and leads to a place &s;o pathle&s;s and lone&s;ome <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">This, in another of her letters, is thus de&s;cribed:&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'A piece of ruins upon it, the remains of an old chapel, now &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of the coppice; here and there an overgrown oak, &s;urrounded with ivy and mi&s;letoe, &s;tarting up, to &s;anctify, as it were, the awful &s;olemne&s;s of the place: A &s;pot, too, where a man having been found hanging &s;ome years ago, it was u&s;ed to be thought of by us when children, and by the maid-&s;ervants, with a degree of terror; as the habitation of owls, ravens, and other ominous birds; and as haunted by gho&s;ts, goblins, &s;pectres: The genuine re&s;ult of country loneline&s;s and ignorance: Notions which, early propagated, are apt to leave im|pre&s;&s;ions even upon minds grown &s;trong enough, at the &s;ame time, to de&s;pi&s;e the like credulous follies in others.'</Q></NOTE>. If not, there <HI>can</HI> be no other way to go off (if one would), without di&s;covery, unle&s;s by the pla&s;hy lane, &s;o full of &s;prings, by which your &s;ervant reaches the &s;olitary wood-hou&s;e; to which lane one mu&s;t de&s;cend from a high bank, that bounds the poultry-yard. For, as to the front-way, you know, one mu&s;t pa&s;s thro' the hou&s;e to That, and in &s;ight of the parlours, and the &s;ervants hall; then have the large open court-yard to go through, and, by means of the iron-gate, be full in view, as one pa&s;|&s;es
<PB N="274" REF="276">
over the lawn, for a quarter of a mile together; the young plantations of elms and limes affording yet but little &s;hade or covert.</P>
<P>The Ivy &s;ummer-hou&s;e is the mo&s;t convenient for this affecting purpo&s;e of any &s;pot in the garden, as it is not far from the back-door, and yet in another alley, as you may remember. Then it is &s;eldom re|&s;orted to by any-body el&s;e, except in the &s;ummer-months, becau&s;e it is cool. When they loved me, they would often, for this rea&s;on, object to my long continuance in it:&mdash;But now, it is no matter what becomes of me. Be&s;ides, <HI>cold is a bracer,</HI> as my bro|ther &s;aid ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>Here I will depo&s;ite what I have written. Let me have your prayers, my dear; and your approbation, or your cen&s;ure, of the &s;teps I have taken: For yet it may not be quite too late to revoke the appointment. I am</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XL. Mi&s;s <HI>HOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sat. Afternoon.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BY your la&s;t date of Ten, in your letter of this day, you could not long have depo&s;ited it, before Robin took it. He rode hard, and brought it to me ju&s;t as I had ri&s;en from table.</P>
<P>You may ju&s;tly blame me for &s;ending my me&s;&s;en|ger empty-handed, your &s;ituation con&s;ider'd; and yet that very &s;ituation [&s;o critical!] is partly the rea|&s;on for it: For indeed I knew not what to write, fit to &s;end you.</P>
<P>I had been inquiring privately, how to procure you a conveyance from Harlowe-Place, and yet not ap|pear in it; knowing, that to oblige in the <HI>fact,</HI> and
<PB N="275" REF="277">
to di&s;oblige in the <HI>manner,</HI> is but obliging by halves: My mamma being, moreover, very &s;u&s;picious, and very unea&s;y; made more &s;o by daily vi&s;its from your uncle Antony, who tells her, that now every-thing is upon the point of being determined, and hopes, that her daughter will not &s;o interfere, as to di&s;courage your compliance with their wills. This I came at by a way that I cannot take notice of, or <HI>both</HI> &s;hould hear of it, in a manner <HI>neither</HI> would like: And, <HI>without</HI> that, my mamma and I have had almo&s;t hourly bic|kerings.</P>
<P>I found more difficulty than I expected, as the time was confined, and &s;ecre&s;y required, in procuring you a vehicle; and as you &s;o earne&s;tly forbid me to accompany you in your enterprize. Had you not ob|liged me to keep mea&s;ures with my mamma, I could have managed it with ea&s;e. I could even have taken our own chariot, on one pretence or other, and put two hor&s;es extraordinary to it, if I had thought fit; and I could have &s;ent it back from London, and no-body the wi&s;er as to the lodgings we might have taken.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to the Lord, you had permitted This! In|deed I think you are two punctilious a great deal for your &s;ituation. Would you expect to enjoy your&s;elf with your u&s;ual placidne&s;s, and not be ruffled, in an hurricane which every moment threatens to blow your hou&s;e down?</P>
<P>Had your di&s;tre&s;s &s;prung from your&s;elf, that would have been another thing. But when all the world knows where to lay the fault, this alters the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>How can you &s;ay I am happy, when my mamma, to her power, is as much an abettor of their wicked|ne&s;s to my deare&s;t friend, as your aunt, or any-body el&s;e?&mdash;And this thro' the in&s;tigation of that odd-headed and fooli&s;h uncle of yours, who [&s;orry creature that he is] keeps her up to re&s;olutions, which are un|worthy of her, for an example to me, and plea&s;e you.
<PB N="276" REF="278">
Is not this cau&s;e enough for me to ground a re&s;ent|ment upon, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify me for accompanying you; the friend&s;hip between us &s;o well known?</P>
<P>Indeed, my dear, the importance of the ca&s;e con|&s;ider'd, I mu&s;t repeat, That you are too nice. Don't they already think, that your standing-out is owing a good deal to my advice? Have they not prohibited our corre&s;pondence upon that very &s;urmize? And have I, but on <HI>your</HI> account, rea&s;on to value <HI>what</HI> they think?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what di&s;credit have I to fear by &s;uch a &s;tep? What detriment? Would Hickman, do you believe, refu&s;e me upon it?&mdash;If he did, &s;hould I be &s;orry for that?&mdash;Who is it, that has a Soul, who would not be affected by &s;uch an in&s;tance of female friend&s;hip?</P>
<P>But I &s;hould vex and di&s;order my mamma!&mdash;Well, that is &s;omething! But not more than &s;he vexes and di&s;orders me, on her being made an implement by &s;uch a &s;orry creature, who ambles hither every day in &s;pite to my deare&s;t friend.&mdash;Woe be to <HI>both,</HI> if it be for a <HI>double end!</HI>&mdash;Chide me, if you will: I don't care.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, and I in&s;ist upon it, &s;uch a &s;tep would <HI>ennoble</HI> your friend: And if &s;till you will permit it, I will take the office out of Lovelace's hands; and, to-morrow evening, or on Monday, before his time of appointment takes place, will come in a chariot, or chai&s;e: And then, my dear, if we get off as I wi&s;h, will we make terms, and what terms we plea&s;e, with them All. My mamma will be glad to receive her daughter again, I warrant ye: And Hickman will cry for <HI>joy</HI> on my return; or he &s;hall for <HI>&s;orrow.</HI></P>
<P>But you are &s;o very earne&s;tly angry with me for propo&s;ing &s;uch a &s;tep, and have always &s;o much to &s;ay for your &s;ide of any que&s;tion, that I am afraid to urge it farther.&mdash;Only be &s;o good as to encourage me to re&s;ume it, if, upon farther con&s;ideration, and upon
<PB N="277" REF="279">
weighing matters well [and in <HI>this</HI> light, Whether be&s;t to go off with <HI>me,</HI> or with <HI>Lovelace</HI>], you can get over your punctilious regard for my reputation. A wo|man going off with a woman is not &s;o di&s;creditable a thing, &s;urely! and with no view, but to avoid the fellows!&mdash;I &s;ay, only be &s;o good as to <HI>con&s;ider</HI> this point; and if you can get over your &s;cruples, on <HI>my</HI> account, do. And &s;o I will have done with this ar|gument for the pre&s;ent; and apply my&s;elf to &s;ome of the pa&s;&s;ages in yours.</P>
<P>A time, I hope, will come, that I &s;hall be able to read your affecting narratives, without that impa|tience and bitterne&s;s, which now boils over in my heart, and would flow to my pen, were I to enter into the particulars of what you write. And, indeed, I am afraid of giving you my advice at all, or of tell|ing you what I &s;hould do in your ca&s;e [&s;uppo&s;ing you will &s;till refu&s;e my offer]; finding too, what you have been brought, or rather driven, to, without it; le&s;t any evil &s;hould follow it: In which ca&s;e, I &s;hould ne|ver forgive my&s;elf. And this con&s;ideration has added to my difficulties in writing to you, now you are upon &s;uch a cri&s;is, and yet refu&s;e the only method&mdash;But I &s;aid, I would not for the pre&s;ent touch any more that &s;tring. Yet, one word more, chide me, if you plea&s;e: If any harm betide you, I &s;hall for ever blame my mamma&mdash;Indeed I &s;hall&mdash;And perhaps your&s;elf, if you do not accept of my offer.</P>
<P>But one thing, in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and pro|&s;pects, let me advi&s;e: It is this, That if you <HI>do</HI> go away with Mr. Lovelace, you take the fir&s;t opportunity to permit the ceremony to pa&s;s. Why &s;hould you <HI>not,</HI> when every-body will know by <HI>who&s;e</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in <HI>who&s;e</HI> company, you leave your father's hou&s;e, go whither&s;oever you will?&mdash;You may, indeed, keep him at di&s;tance, until &s;ettlements are drawn, and &s;uch-like matters are adju&s;ted to your mind. But even The&s;e are matters of le&s;s con&s;ideration in your
<PB N="278" REF="280">
particular ca&s;e, than they would be in that of mo&s;t others: <HI>Becau&s;e,</HI> be his other faults what they will, no|body thinks him an ungenerous man: <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of your e&s;tate mu&s;t be given up to you, as &s;oon as your cou&s;in Morden comes; who, as your Tru&s;tee, will &s;ee it done; and done upon proper terms: <HI>Be|cau&s;e</HI> there is no want of fortune on his &s;ide: <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> all his family value you, and are extremely de&s;irous that you &s;hould be their relation: <HI>Becau&s;e</HI> he makes no &s;cruple of accepting you without conditions. You &s;ee how he has always defy'd your relations [I, for my own part, can forgive him for that fault: Nor know I, if it be not a noble one]. And I dare &s;ay, he had rather call you <HI>his,</HI> without a &s;hilling, than be under obligation to tho&s;e whom he has full as little rea&s;on to love, as they have to love him. You have heard, that his own relations cannot make his proud &s;pirit &s;ubmit to owe any favour to them.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e rea&s;ons, I think, you may the le&s;s &s;tand upon previous &s;ettlements. It is therefore my ab&s;olute opinion, that, if you <HI>do</HI> go off with him [And in that ca&s;e you mu&s;t let <HI>him</HI> be judge, when he can leave you with &s;afety, you'll ob&s;erve That], you &s;hould not po&s;tpone the ceremony.</P>
<P>Give this matter your mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration. Punctilio is out of doors the moment you are out of your father's hou&s;e. I know how ju&s;tly &s;evere you have been upon tho&s;e inexcu&s;able creatures, who&s;e giddine&s;s, and even want of decency, have made them, in the &s;ame hour, as I may &s;ay, leap from a parent's window to a hu&s;band's bed&mdash;But, con&s;ider|ing Lovelace's character, I repeat my opinion, that your Reputation in the eye of the world requires, that no delay be made in this point, when once you are in his power.</P>
<P>I need not, I am &s;ure, make a &s;tronger plea to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ay, in excu&s;e for my mamma (what my fer|vent
<PB N="279" REF="281">
love for my friend very ill brooks), That we ought not to blame any-one for not doing what &s;he has an option to do, or to let alone. This, in ca&s;es of friend&s;hip, would admit of very &s;trict di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. If the thing reque&s;ted be of <HI>greater</HI> con&s;equence, or even of <HI>equal,</HI> to the per&s;on &s;ought to, and it were, as the old phra&s;e has it, <HI>to take a thorn out of one's friend's foot, to put it into our own,</HI> &s;omething might be &s;aid.&mdash;Nay, it would be, I will venture to &s;ay, a &s;elfi&s;h thing, in us to a&s;k a favour of a friend, which would &s;ub|ject That friend to the <HI>&s;ame</HI> or <HI>equal</HI> inconvenience, as That from which we wanted to be relieved. The reque&s;ter would, in this ca&s;e, teach his friend, by his <HI>own</HI> &s;elfi&s;h example, with much <HI>better</HI> rea&s;on, to deny him, and de&s;pi&s;e a friend&s;hip &s;o <HI>merely</HI> nominal. But if, by a <HI>le&s;s</HI> inconvenience to our&s;elves, we could relieve our friend from a <HI>greater,</HI> the refu&s;al of &s;uch a favour makes the refu&s;er unworthy of the name of Friend: Nor would I admit &s;uch a one, not even into the outermo&s;t fold of my heart.</P>
<P>I am well aware, that this is your opinion of friend|&s;hip, as well as mine: For I owe the di&s;tinction to you, upon a certain occa&s;ion; and it &s;aved me from a very great inconvenience, as you mu&s;t needs re|member. But you was always for making excu&s;es for <HI>other</HI> people, in ca&s;es wherein you would not have allowed of one for <HI>yourfelf.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t own, that were the&s;e excu&s;es for a friend's indifference, or denial, made by any-body but <HI>you,</HI> in a ca&s;e of &s;uch <HI>va&s;t</HI> importance to her&s;elf, and of &s;o comparative a <HI>&s;mall</HI> one to tho&s;e who&s;e protection &s;he would be thought to wi&s;h for; I, who am for ever, as you have often remarked, endeavouring to trace effects to their cau&s;es, &s;hould be ready to &s;u&s;pect, that there was a latent, un-owned inclination, which ba|lancing, or <HI>preponderating</HI> rather, made the i&s;&s;ue of the alternative &s;how ever important) &s;it more lightly upon the excu&s;er's mind than &s;he cared to own.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="282">You will under&s;tand me, my dear. But if you do not, it may be as well for me; for I am afraid I &s;hall <HI>have it</HI> from you, for but &s;tarting &s;uch a notion, or giving a hint, which, perhaps, as you did once in another ca&s;e, you will reprimandingly call,

<P>What &s;ignifies owning a fault, without mending it, you'll &s;ay?&mdash;Very true, my dear. But you know I ever was a &s;aucy creature!&mdash;Ever &s;tood in need of great allowances.&mdash;And I know, likewi&s;e, that I ever had them from my dear Clari&s;&s;a Harlowe. Nor do I doubt them now: For you know how much I love you!&mdash;If it be po&s;&s;ible, <HI>more</HI> than <HI>my&s;elf</HI> I love you! Believe me, my dear! And, in con&s;equence of that belief, you will be able to judge, how much I am affected by your pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;sful and critical &s;itua|tion; which will not &s;uffer me to pa&s;s by, without a cen&s;ure, even that philo&s;ophy of temper in your own cau&s;e, which you have not in another's, and which all that know you, ever admired you for.</P>
<P>From this critical and di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation, it &s;hall be my hourly prayers, that you may be delivered without blemi&s;h to that fair fame, which has hitherto, like your heart, been un&s;potted.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Saturday Afternoon.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ALready have I an ec&s;tatic an&s;wer, as I may call it, to my letter.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He promi&s;es compliance in every article with my will: Approves of all I propo&s;e; particularly of the private lodging: And thinks it a happy expedient to obviate the cen&s;ures of the bu&s;y and the unreflect|ing: And yet he hopes, that the putting my&s;elf into the protection of either of his aunts, treated as I am treated, would be far from being looked upon by any, in a di&s;reputable light. But every thing I injoin, or re&s;olve upon, mu&s;t, he &s;ays, be right, not only with re&s;pect to my pre&s;ent, but future, ho|nour; with regard to which, he hopes &s;o to behave him&s;elf, as to be <HI>allow'd</HI> to be next to my&s;elf, more &s;olicitous than any-body. He will only a&s;&s;ure me, that his whole family are extremely de&s;irous to take advantage of the per&s;ecutions I labour under, to make their court, and endear them&s;elves, to me; by their be&s;t and mo&s;t chearful &s;ervices: Happy, if they can, in any mea&s;ure, contribute to my pre&s;ent freedom, and future happine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He will this afternoon, he &s;ays, write to his uncle, and to both his aunts, that he is now within view of being the happie&s;t man in the world, if it be not his own fault; &s;ince the only woman upon earth that can make him &s;o, will be &s;oon out of danger of being another man's; and cannot po&s;&s;ibly pre&s;cribe

any terms to him, that he &s;hall not think it his duty to comply with.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He flatters him&s;elf now (my la&s;t letter <HI>confirming</HI> my re&s;olution), that he can be in no apprehen&s;ion of my changing my mind, unle&s;s my friends change their manner of acting by me; which he is too &s;ure they will not. And now will all his relations, who take &s;uch a kind and generous &s;hare in his intere&s;ts, glory and pride them&s;elves in the pro&s;pects he has before him.</Q></P>
<P>Thus artfully does he hold me to it!&mdash;</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'As to fortune, he begs of me not to be &s;olicitous on that &s;core: That his own e&s;tate is &s;ufficient for us both; not a <HI>nominal,</HI> but a <HI>real,</HI> two thou&s;and pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> equivalent to &s;ome e&s;tates reputed a third more: That it never was incumbred: That he is clear of the world, both as to book and bond-debts; thanks, perhaps, to his pride, more than to his virtue. That his uncle moreover re&s;olves to &s;ettle upon him a thou|&s;and pounds <HI>per annum</HI> on his nuptials. And this, (if he writes to his Lord&s;hip's honour) more from mo|tives of <HI>ju&s;tice,</HI> than from tho&s;e of <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> as he ought to con&s;ider it but as an equivalent for an e&s;tate which he had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, to which <HI>his</HI> [Mr. Lovelace's] mother had better preten&s;ions. That his Lord&s;hip al&s;o propo&s;ed to give him up either his &s;eat in Hertford&s;hire, or that in Lanca&s;hire, at his own or at his wife's option, e&s;pecially if I am the per&s;on.

<P>He &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I need not be under any &s;olicitude as to <HI>apparel:</HI> All <HI>immediate</HI> occa&s;ions of That &s;ort will be mo&s;t chearfully &s;upplied by his aunts, or his cou&s;ins Montague: As my others &s;hall, with the greate&s;t pride and plea&s;ure (if I will allow him that honour), by him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="285">
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I &s;hall govern him as I plea&s;e, with regard to any-thing in his power towards effecting a recon|ciliation with my friends: A point he knows my heart is &s;et upon.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He is afraid, that the time will hardly allow of his procuring Mi&s;s Charlotte Montague's attendance upon me, at St. Albans, as he had propo&s;ed &s;he &s;hould; becau&s;e, he under&s;tands, &s;he keeps her cham|ber, with a violent cold, and &s;ore throat. But both &s;he and her &s;i&s;ter, the fir&s;t moment &s;he is able to go abroad, &s;hall vi&s;it me at my private lodgings; and introduce me to their aunts, or their aunts to me, as I &s;hall choo&s;e; and accompany me to town, if I plea&s;e; and &s;tay as long in it with me, as I &s;hall think fit to &s;tay there.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Lord M. will al&s;o, at my own time, and in my own manner, that is to &s;ay, either publicly or pri|vately, make me a vi&s;it.

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'He had thoughts once, he &s;ays, on hearing of his cou&s;in Charlotte's indi&s;po&s;ition, to have engaged his cou&s;in Patty's attendance upon me, either at or about the neighbouring village, or at St. Albans: But, he &s;ays, &s;he is a low-&s;pirited, timorous girl, who would but the more perplex us.'</Q></P>
<P>So, my dear, the enterprize requires courage and high &s;pirits, you &s;ee!&mdash;And indeed it does!&mdash;What am I about to do!&mdash;</P>
<P>He him&s;elf, it is plain, thinks it nece&s;&s;ary, that I &s;hould be accompanied with one of my own Sex!&mdash;He might, at lea&s;t, have propo&s;ed the woman of one of the Ladies of his family.&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me!&mdash;What am I about to do!&mdash;</P>
<P>AFTER all, far as I have gone, I know not but I may &s;till recede: And if I do, a mortal quarrel, I

&s;uppo&s;e, will en&s;ue.&mdash;And what if it does?&mdash;Could there be any way to e&s;cape this Solmes, a breach with Lovelace might make way for the Single Life [&s;o much, my preferable wi&s;h!] to take place: And then I would defy the Sex. For I &s;ee nothing but trouble and vexation that they bring upon ours: And when once enter'd, one is obliged to go on with them, treading, with tender feet, upon thorns, and &s;harper thorns, to the end of a painful journey.</P>
<P>What to do, I know not. The more I think, the more I am embarra&s;s'd!&mdash;And the &s;tronger will be my doubts, as the appointed time draws nearer.</P>
<P>But I will go down, and take a little turn in the garden; and depo&s;ite This, and his letters, all but the two la&s;t; which I will inclo&s;e in my next, if I have opportunity to write another.</P>
<P>Mean time, my dear friend&mdash;But what can I de&s;ire you to pray for?&mdash;Adieu then!&mdash;Let me only &s;ay,&mdash;Adieu!&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLII. Mi&s;s <HI>CLARISSA HARLOWE,</HI> To Mi&s;s HOWE. [In an&s;wer to Letter <HI>XL.</HI>]</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Sunday Morning, April 9.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DO not think, my beloved friend, altho' you have given me, in yours of ye&s;terday, a <HI>&s;everer</HI> in&s;tance of what, neverthele&s;s, I mu&s;t call your <HI>im|partial</HI> Love, than ever yet I received from you, that I will be di&s;plea&s;ed with you for it. That would be to put my&s;elf into the inconvenient &s;ituation of Royalty: That is to &s;ay, Out of the way of ever be|ing told of my faults; of ever mending them; and In the way of making the &s;incere&s;t and warme&s;t friend|&s;hip u&s;ele&s;s to me.</P>
<P>And then how brightly, how nobly, burns this &s;acred flame in your bo&s;om! that you are ready to
<PB N="285" REF="287">
impute to the unhappy &s;ufferer a <HI>le&s;s degree</HI> of warmth in <HI>her own</HI> cau&s;e, than <HI>you</HI> have for her, becau&s;e &s;he endeavours to dive&s;t her&s;elf of <HI>Self,</HI> &s;o far as to leave others to the option which they have a right to make? Ought I, my dear, to blame, ought I not rather to admire, you for this ardor?</P>
<P>But, neverthele&s;s, le&s;t you &s;hould think, that there is any foundation for a &s;urmize, which, altho' it owe its ri&s;e to your friend&s;hip, would, if there <HI>were,</HI> leave me utterly inexcu&s;able; I mu&s;t, inju&s;tice to my&s;elf, declare, That I know not my own heart, if I have any of that <HI>latent</HI> or <HI>un-owned inclination,</HI> which you would impute to <HI>any other but me.</HI> Nor does the <HI>im|portant alternative &s;it lightly on my mind.</HI> And yet I mu&s;t excu&s;e your mamma, were it but on this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, That I could not pre&s;ume to reckon upon <HI>her</HI> favour, as I could upon her <HI>daughter</HI>'s, &s;o as to make the claim of friend&s;hip upon <HI>her,</HI> to whom, as the mother of my deare&s;t friend, a veneration is owing, which can hardly be compatible with that &s;weet fami|liarity, which is one of the indi&s;pen&s;ibles of the &s;acred tie by which your heart and mine are bound in one.</P>
<P>What therefore I might expect from my <HI>Anna Howe,</HI> I <HI>ought not</HI> from her <HI>mamma</HI>; for would it not be very &s;trange, that a per&s;on of her experience &s;hould be reflected upon, becau&s;e &s;he gave not up her own judgment, where the con&s;equence of her doing &s;o would be, to embroil her&s;elf, as &s;he apprehends, with a family &s;he has lived well with, and in behalf of a child again&s;t her parents?&mdash;As &s;he has, moreover, a daughter of her own:&mdash;A daughter too, give me leave to &s;ay, of who&s;e vivacity and charming &s;pirits &s;he is more apprehen&s;ive than &s;he need to be; becau&s;e her truly maternal cares make her fear more from her <HI>youth,</HI> than &s;he hopes from her <HI>prudence</HI>; which ne|verthele&s;s &s;he, and all the world, know to be <HI>beyond</HI> her years.</P>
<P>And here let me add, That whatever you may
<PB N="286" REF="288">
generou&s;ly, and as the re&s;ult of an ardent affection for your unhappy friend, urge on this head, in my behalf, or har&s;hly again&s;t any one who may refu&s;e me protection in &s;uch extraordinary circum&s;tances as I find my&s;elf in; I have &s;ome plea&s;ure, in being able to curb undue expectations upon my indulgent friends, whatever were to befal my&s;elf from tho&s;e circum|&s;tances; for I &s;hould be extremely mortified, were I, by my &s;elfi&s;h forwardne&s;s, to give occa&s;ion for &s;uch a check, as to be told, that I had encouraged an un|rea&s;onable hope; or, according to the phra&s;e you men|tion, wi&s;hed to take a <HI>Thorn out of my own foot, and to put it into that of my friend.</HI> Nor &s;hould I be better plea&s;ed with my&s;elf, if, having been taught by my good Mrs. Norton, that the be&s;t of &s;chools, is <HI>That of affliction,</HI> I &s;hould rather learn impatience than the contrary, by the le&s;&s;ons I am obliged to get by heart in it; and if I &s;hould judge of the merits of others, as they were <HI>kind to me</HI>; and that at the expence of their own convenience or peace of mind. For is not This to &s;uppo&s;e my&s;elf ever in the right; and all who do not act as I would have them act, perpetually in the wrong? In &s;hort, to make <HI>my</HI> &s;ake, <HI>God</HI>'s &s;ake, in the &s;en&s;e of Mr. Solmes's pitiful plea to me.</P>
<P>How often, my dear, have You and I endeavour'd to detect and cen&s;ure this partial &s;pirit in others?</P>
<P>But I know, you do not always content your&s;elf with &s;aying what you think may <HI>ju&s;tly</HI> be &s;aid: But, in order to &s;hew the extent of a penetration, which can go to the bottom of any &s;ubject, delight to &s;ay, or to write, all that <HI>can</HI> be &s;aid, or <HI>written,</HI> or even <HI>thought,</HI> on the particular occa&s;ion; and this partly, perhaps, from being de&s;irous (pardon me, my dear!) to be thought mi&s;tre&s;s of a &s;agacity that is aforehand with events. But who would wi&s;h to drain off, or dry up, a refre&s;hing current, becau&s;e it now and then puts us to &s;ome little inconvenience by its over-flow|ings? In other words, who would not allow, for the
<PB N="287" REF="289">
liveline&s;s of a &s;pirit, which, for one painful &s;en&s;ibility, gives an hundred plea&s;urable ones: And the <HI>one</HI> in con&s;equence of the <HI>other?</HI></P>
<P>But now I come to the two points in your letter, that mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly concern me: Thus you put them:
<Q><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Whether I choo&s;e not rather to go off with one of my <HI>own Sex</HI>; with my ANNA HOWE&mdash;than with one of the <HI>other</HI>; with Mr. LOVELACE?'</Q></P>
<P>And if <HI>not,</HI></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">'Whether I &s;hould not marry him, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible?'</Q></P></Q></P>
<P>You know, my dear, my rea&s;ons for rejecting your propo&s;al, and even for being earne&s;t that you &s;hould not be <HI>known</HI> to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to me in an enterprize, which a cruel nece&s;&s;ity induced <HI>me</HI> to think of engaging in; and which <HI>you</HI> have not the &s;ame plea for. At this rate, <HI>well</HI> might your mamma be unea&s;y at our cor|re&s;pondence, not knowing to what inconveniencies it might &s;ubject her and you!&mdash;If <HI>I</HI> am hardly ex|cu&s;able to think of flying from my <HI>unkind</HI> friends, what could <HI>you</HI> have to &s;ay for your&s;elf, were you to abandon a mother &s;o <HI>indulgent?</HI> Does &s;he &s;u&s;pect, that your fervent friend&s;hip may lead you to a <HI>&s;mall</HI> indi&s;cretion? and does this &s;u&s;picion offend you? And would you, in revenge, &s;hew her and the world, that you can voluntarily ru&s;h into the <HI>highe&s;t error,</HI> that any of our &s;ex can be guilty of?</P>
<P>And is it worthy of your genero&s;ity [I a&s;k you, my dear, is it?] to think of taking &s;o undutiful a &s;tep, becau&s;e you believe your mamma would be glad to receive you again?</P>
<P>I do a&s;&s;ure you, that were I to take this &s;tep my|&s;elf, I would run all ri&s;ques rather than you &s;hould accompany me in it. Have I, do you think, a de&s;ire to <HI>double</HI> and <HI>treble</HI> my own fault, in the eye of the world? In the eye of that world, which, cruelly as I am u&s;ed (not knowing all), would not acquit <HI>me?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="290">But, my deare&s;t, kinde&s;t friend, let me tell you, That we will <HI>neither</HI> of us take &s;uch a &s;tep. The manner of putting your que&s;tions, abundantly con|vinces me, that I ought not, in <HI>your</HI> opinion, to <HI>at|tempt</HI> it. You, no doubt, intend, that I &s;hall <HI>&s;o</HI> take it; and I thank you for the equally polite and forcible conviction.</P>
<P>It is &s;ome &s;atisfaction to me, taking the matter in this light, that I had begun to waver before I received your la&s;t. And now I tell you, that it has ab&s;olutely determin'd me <HI>not</HI> to go away; at lea&s;t, not to-morrow.</P>
<P>If <HI>You,</HI> my dear, think the <HI>i&s;&s;ue of the alternative,</HI> to u&s;e your own words, <HI>&s;its &s;o lightly upon my mind</HI>&punc; in &s;hort, that my <HI>inclination</HI> is <HI>faulty</HI>; the <HI>world</HI> would treat me much le&s;s &s;crupulou&s;ly. When, therefore, you repre&s;ent, <HI>that all punctilio mu&s;t be at an end the moment I am out of my father's hou&s;e</HI>; and hint, that I mu&s;t &s;ubmit it to Lovelace to judge <HI>when</HI> he can leave me with &s;afety; that is to &s;ay, give <HI>him</HI> the option whether he will leave me, or not; Who can bear the&s;e reflections, and re&s;olve to incur the&s;e in|conveniences, that has the que&s;tion &s;till in her own power to decide upon?</P>
<P>While I thought only of an e&s;cape from <HI>This hou&s;e,</HI> as an e&s;cape from Mr. <HI>Solmes</HI>; that already my reputa|tion &s;uffer'd by my confinement; and that it would be &s;till in my own option, either to marry Mr. Lovelace, or wholly to renounce him; Bold as the &s;tep was, I thought, treated as I am treated, &s;omething was to be &s;aid in excu&s;e of it&mdash;If not to the world, to <HI>my|self:</HI> And to be <HI>&s;elf</HI>-acquitted, is a ble&s;&s;ing to be pre|ferred to the opinion of all the world. But, after I have cen&s;ured that indi&s;creet forwardne&s;s in &s;ome, who (flying from their chamber to the altar) have, with|out the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> ceremony, ru&s;h'd upon the <HI>greate&s;t:</HI> After I have &s;tipulated with him for time, and for an ulti|mate option, whether to accept or refu&s;e him; and for his leaving me, as &s;oon as I am in a place of &s;afety
<PB N="289" REF="291">
(which, as you ob&s;erve, <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t be the judge of): And after he has comply'd with the&s;e terms; &s;o that I cannot, if I <HI>would,</HI> recall them, and &s;uddenly marry;&mdash;You &s;ee, my dear, that I have nothing left me, but to re&s;olve, <HI>not</HI> to go away with him.</P>
<P>But, how, on this revocation, &s;hall I be able to pacify him?</P>

<P>NOBODY, it &s;eems, will go to church this day. No ble&s;&s;ing to be expected perhaps upon views &s;o worldly, and in &s;ome &s;o cruel.</P>
<P>They have a mi&s;tru&s;t that I have &s;ome device in my head. Betty has been looking among my cloaths. I found her, on coming up from depo&s;iting my letter to Lovelace [for I <HI>have</HI> written!] peering among them, the key being in the lock. She colour'd, and was

confounded to be caught. But I only &s;aid, I &s;hould be accu&s;tom'd to <HI>any</HI> &s;ort of treatment in time!&mdash;If &s;he had her orders&mdash;tho&s;e were enough for her.</P>
<P>She own'd, in her confu&s;ion, that a motion had been made to abridge me of my airings; and the re|port <HI>&s;he</HI> &s;hould make, would be no di&s;advantage to me.

And, added the bold creature, if you don't intend to do &s;o, Your conduct, Mi&s;s, &s;eems &s;trange to me.&mdash;Only thus &s;he reconciled it; That I had gone &s;o far, I knew not how to come off <HI>genteelly:</HI> And &s;he fancy'd I &s;hould, in <HI>full congre|gation,</HI> on Wedne&s;day, give Mr. Solmes my hand.

<P>O MY dear! There yet lies the letter, ju&s;t as I left it!</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare&s;t Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have got intelligence from one as &s;ays &s;he knows, that you mu&s;t be married on Wedne&s;day morning to Mr. Solmes. May-be, how&s;oever, only to vex me; for it is Betty Barnes: A &s;aucy creature, I'm &s;ure. A licen&s;e is got, as &s;he &s;ays: And &s;o far &s;he went as to tell me (bidding me &s;ay nothing; but &s;he knew as that I would) that Mr. Brand the young Oxford Clergy|man, and fine &s;cholar, is to marry you. For Dr. Lewin, I hear, refu&s;es, unle&s;s you con&s;ent; and they have heard that he does not like over-well their pro|ceedings again&s;t you; and &s;ays, as that you don't de|&s;erve to be treated &s;o cruelly as you are treated. But Mr. Brand, I am told, is to have his fortune made by uncle Harlowe, and among them.</P>
<P>You will know better than I what to make of all the&s;e matters; for &s;ometimes I think Betty tells me things as if I &s;hould not tell you, and yet expects as that I will. She, and all the world knows how I love you: And &s;o I would <HI>have</HI> them. It is an ho|nour to me to love &s;uch a dear young Lady, who is an honour to all her family, let them &s;ay what they will. But there is &s;uch whi&s;pering between this Betty, and Mi&s;s Harlowe, as you can't imagine; and when that is done, Betty comes and tells me &s;omething.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be &s;ure (and that is why I write: But
<PB N="296" REF="300">
pray burn it) you are to be &s;earched once more for letters, and for pen and ink; for they know you write. Something they pretend to have betray'd out of one of Mr. Lovelace's &s;ervants, as they hope to make &s;omething of; I know not what. That mu&s;t be a very vilde and wicked man, who would brag of Lady's goodne&s;s to him, and tell &s;ecrets. Mr. Love|lace is too much of a gentleman for that, I dare &s;ay. If not, who can be &s;afe of young innocent creatures, &s;uch as we be?</P>
<P>Then they have a notion, from that fal&s;e Betty, I beliefe, as that you intend to take &s;omething to make your&s;elf &s;ick, or &s;ome &s;uch thing; and &s;o they will &s;earch for phials and powders, and &s;uch-like.</P>
<P>Strange &s;earching among them! God ble&s;s us young creatures, when we come among &s;uch &s;u&s;picious re|lations. But, thank God, my mamma is not &s;uch a one, at the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If nothing be found, you are to be u&s;ed kindlier for that, by your papa, at the grand judgment, as I may call it.</P>
<P>Yet, &s;ick or well, alas, my dear cou&s;in! you mu&s;t be married, belike. So &s;ays this &s;ame creature; and I don't doubt it: But your hu&s;band is to go home every night, till you are reconciled to go to him. And &s;o illne&s;s can be no pretence to &s;ave you.</P>
<P>They are &s;ure you will make a good wife, when you be one. So would not I, unle&s;s I liked my hu&s;|band. And Mr. Solmes is always telling them how he will purcha&s;e your love and all that, by jewels and fine things.&mdash;A &s;iccofant of a man!&mdash;I wi&s;h he and Betty Barnes were to come together; and he would beat her every-day till &s;he was good.&mdash;So, in brief, &s;ecure every thing you would not have &s;een: And burn This, I beg you. And, pray, deare&s;t Madam, do not take nothing as may hurt your health: For that will not do. I am,</P>

Some things that have been told us ye&s;terday, which came from the mouth of one of the mo&s;t de&s;perate and in&s;o|lent men in the world, convince your father, and all of us, that you &s;till find means to write out of the hou&s;e. Mr. Lovelace knows every-thing that is done here; and that as &s;oon as done; and great mi&s;chief is appre|hended from him, which you are as much concerned as any-body, to prevent. Your mamma has al&s;o &s;ome apprehen&s;ions concerning your&s;elf, which yet &s;he hopes are groundle&s;s; but, however, cannot be ea&s;y, nor will be permitted to be ea&s;y, if &s;he would, un|le&s;s (while you remain here in the garden, or in this &s;ummer-hou&s;e) you give her the opportunity once more of looking into your clo&s;et, your cabinet, and drawers. It will be the better taken, if you give me chearfully your keys. I hope, my dear, you won't di&s;pute it. Your de&s;ire of dining in this place was the more readily comply'd with, for the &s;ake of &s;uch an opportunity.</P>
<P>I thought my&s;elf very lucky, to be &s;o well pre|pared, by my cou&s;in Dolly's means, for this &s;earch:
<PB N="300" REF="304">
But yet I artfully made &s;ome &s;cruples, and not a few complaints of this treatment: After which, I not only gave her the keys of all; but even officiou&s;ly empty'd my pockets before her, and invited her to put her fingers in my &s;tays, that &s;he might be &s;ure that I had no papers there.</P>
<P>This highly obliged her; and &s;he &s;aid, She would repre&s;ent my chearful compliance as it de&s;erved, <HI>let my brother and &s;i&s;ter &s;ay what they would.</HI> My mam|ma, in particular, &s;he was &s;ure, would rejoice at the opportunity given her to obviate, as &s;he doubted not would be the ca&s;e, &s;ome &s;u&s;picions that were rai&s;ed again&s;t me.</P>
<P>She then hinted, That there were methods taken to come at all Mr. Lovelace's &s;ecrets, and even, from his carele&s;s communicativene&s;s, at &s;ome of <HI>mine</HI>; it being, &s;he &s;aid, his cu&s;tom, boa&s;tingly to prate to his very &s;ervants of his intentions, in particular ca&s;es. She added, that, deep as he was thought to be, my brother was as deep as he; and fairly too hard for him at his own weapons;&mdash;as one day it would be found.</P>
<P>I knew not, I &s;aid, the meaning of the&s;e dark hints. I thought the cunning &s;he hinted at, on <HI>both</HI> &s;ides, called rather for contempt than applau&s;e. I my&s;elf might have been put upon artifices which my heart di&s;dained to practi&s;e, had I given way to the re&s;ent|ment, which, I was bold to &s;ay, was much more ju&s;ti|fiable than the actions that occa&s;ion'd it: That it was evident to me, from what &s;he had &s;aid, that their pre|&s;ent &s;u&s;picions of me were partly owing to this &s;up|po&s;ed &s;uperior cunning of my brother; and partly to the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that the u&s;age I met with might naturally produce a rea&s;on for &s;uch &s;u&s;picions: That it was very unhappy for me, to be made the butt of my brother's wit: That it would have been more to his prai&s;e, to have aimed at &s;hewing a kind heart, than a cunning head: That, neverthele&s;s, I wi&s;hed,
<PB N="301" REF="305">
he knew <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as well as I imagin'd <HI>I</HI> knew him; and he would then have le&s;s conceit of his abi|lities: Which abilities would, in my opinion, be le&s;s thought of, if his power to do ill offices were not much greater than them.</P>
<P>I was vex'd. I could not help making this re|flection. The dupe the other, too probably, makes of him, thro' his own &s;py, de&s;erv'd it. But I &s;o little approve of this low art in either, that were I but tole|rably u&s;ed, the vilene&s;s of that man, that Jo&s;eph Le|man, &s;hould be inquired into.</P>
<P>She was &s;orry, &s;he &s;aid, to find, that I thought &s;o di&s;paragingly of my brother. He was a young gen|tleman both of learning and parts.</P>
<P>Learning enough, I &s;aid, to make him vain of it among us women: But not of parts &s;ufficient to make his learning valuable either to him&s;elf, or to any-body el&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed, indeed, that he had more good-nature: But &s;he feared, that I had too great an opinion of &s;omebody el&s;e, to think &s;o well of my brother, as a &s;i&s;ter ought: Since, between the two, there was a &s;ort of rivalry as to abilities, that made them hate one another.</P>
<P><HI>Rivalry,</HI> Madam, &s;aid I!&mdash;If that be the ca&s;e, or whether it be or not, I wi&s;h they both under&s;tood better than either of them &s;eems to do, what it becomes gentlemen, and men of liberal education, to be, and to do.&mdash;Neither of them, then, would glory in what they ought to be a&s;hamed of.</P>
<P>But waving this &s;ubject, it was not impo&s;&s;ible, I &s;aid, that they might find a little of my writing, and a pen or two, and a little ink [Hated art!&mdash;or rather, hateful the nece&s;&s;ity for it!], as I was not permitted to go up to put them out of the way: But, if they did, I mu&s;t be contented. And I a&s;&s;ured her, that, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke what time they plea&s;ed, I would not go in to di&s;turb them, but would be either in or near the garden,
<PB N="302" REF="306">
in this &s;ummer-hou&s;e, or in the cedar one, about my poultry-yard, or near the great ca&s;cade, till I was or|der'd to return to my pri&s;on. With like cunning I &s;aid, that I &s;uppo&s;ed the unkind &s;earch would not be made, till the &s;ervants had dined; becau&s;e I doubted not, that the pert Betty Barnes, who knew all the corners of my apartment and clo&s;et, would be im|ploy'd in it.</P>
<P>She hoped, &s;he &s;aid, that nothing could be found that would give a handle again&s;t me: For, &s;he would a&s;&s;ure me, the motives to the &s;earch, on my mamma's part e&s;pecially, were, that &s;he hoped to find rea&s;on rather to acquit than to blame me; and that my papa might be induced to &s;ee me to-morrow night, or Wedne&s;day morning, with temper: With <HI>tenderne&s;s,</HI> I &s;hould rather &s;ay, &s;aid &s;he; for he is re&s;olved &s;o to do, if no new offence be given.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, &s;aid I!&mdash;</P>
<P>Why that Ah, Madam, and &s;haking your head &s;o &s;ignificantly?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, Madam, that I may not have more rea&s;on to dread my papa's continued di&s;plea&s;ure, than to hope for his returning tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>You don't <HI>know,</HI> my dear!&mdash;Things may take a turn&mdash;Things may not be &s;o bad as you fear&mdash;</P>
<P>Deare&s;t Madam, have you any con&s;olation to give me?&mdash;</P>
<P>Why, my dear, it is po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>you</HI> may be more compliable than you have been.</P>
<P>Why rai&s;ed you my hopes, Madam!&mdash;Don't let me think my dear aunt Hervey cruel to a niece who truly honours her.</P>
<P>I may tell you more perhaps, &s;aid &s;he, (but in con|fidence, in ab&s;olute confidence) if the inquiry within come out in your favour. Do you know of any-thing above, that can be found to your di&s;advantage?</P>
<P>Some papers they will find, I doubt: But I mu&s;t take con&s;equences. My brother and &s;i&s;ter will be at
<PB N="303" REF="307">
hand with their good-natured con&s;tructions. I am made de&s;perate, and care not what is found.</P>
<P>She hoped, &s;he <HI>earne&s;tly</HI> hoped, &s;he &s;aid, that nothing could be found, that would impeach my di&s;cretion; and then&mdash;But &s;he might &s;ay too much&mdash;</P>
<P>And away &s;he went, having added to my perplexity.</P>
<P>But I now can think of nothing but this man!&mdash;This interview!&mdash;Would to Heaven it were over!&mdash;To meet to quarrel&mdash;But I will not &s;tay a moment with him, let him take what mea&s;ures he will upon it, if he be not quite calm and re&s;igned.</P>
<P>Don't you &s;ee how crooked &s;ome of my lines are? Don't you &s;ee how &s;ome of the letters &s;tagger, more than others!&mdash;That is when this interview is more in my head, than my &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But, after all, &s;hould I, <HI>ought</HI> I, to meet him? How I have taken it for granted, that I &s;hould!&mdash;I wi&s;h there were time to take your advice. Yet you are &s;o loth to &s;peak <HI>quite</HI> out!&mdash;But that I owe, as you own, to the difficulty of my &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have mentioned, that in the cour&s;e of this conver&s;ation I be&s;ought my aunt to &s;tand my friend, and to put in a word for me, on my approaching trial; and to endeavour to procure me time for con&s;idera|tion, if I could obtain nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P>She told me, that, after the ceremony was per|form'd [odious confirmation of a hint in my cou&s;in Dolly's letter!] I &s;hould have what time I plea&s;ed to reconcile my&s;elf to my lot, before cohabitation.</P>
<P>This put me out of all patience.</P>
<P>She reque&s;ted of me in <HI>her</HI> turn, &s;he &s;aid, that I would re&s;olve to meet them all with chearful duty, and with a &s;pirit of ab&s;olute acquie&s;cence. It was in my power to make them all happy. And how affect|ingly joyful would it be to her, &s;he &s;aid, to &s;ee my father, my mother, my uncles, my brother, my &s;i&s;ter, all embracing me with raptures, and folding me by turns to their fond hearts, and congratulating each
<PB N="304" REF="308">
other on their re&s;tored happine&s;s. Her own joy, &s;he &s;aid, would probably make her motionle&s;s and &s;peech|le&s;s, for a time: And for her Dolly&mdash;the poor girl, who had &s;uffer'd in the e&s;teem of &s;ome, for her <HI>grate|ful</HI> attachment to me, would have every-body love her again.</P>
<P>Will you doubt, my dear, that my next trial will be the mo&s;t affecting that I have yet had?</P>
<P>My aunt &s;et forth all this in &s;o &s;trong a light, and I was &s;o particularly touched on my cou&s;in Dol|ly's account, that, impatient as I was ju&s;t before, I was greatly moved: Yet could only &s;hew by my &s;ighs and my tears, how de&s;irable &s;uch an event would be to me, could it be brought about upon conditions with which it was po&s;&s;ible for me to comply.</P>
<P>Here comes Betty Barnes with my dinner&mdash;</P>
<P>The wench is gone. The time of meeting is at hand. O that he may not come!&mdash;But &s;hould I, or &s;hould I not, meet him?&mdash;How I que&s;tion, without po&s;&s;ibility of a timely an&s;wer!</P>
<P>Betty, according to my leading hint to my aunt, boa&s;ted to me, that &s;he was to be <HI>imploy'd,</HI> as &s;he called it, after &s;he had eat her own dinner.</P>
<P>She &s;hould be &s;orry, &s;he told me, to have me found out. Yet 'twould be all for my good: I &s;hould have it in my power to be forgiven for all at once, before Wedne&s;day night. The Confidence then, to &s;tifle a laugh, put a corner of her apron in her mouth, and went to the door: And on her return, to take away, as I angrily bid her, &s;he begg'd my excu&s;e.&mdash;But&mdash;But&mdash;and then the &s;aucy creature laugh'd again, &s;he could not help it; to think how I had drawn my&s;elf in by my &s;ummer-hou&s;e dinnering; &s;ince it had given &s;o fine an opportunity, by way of &s;urprize, to look into all my private hoards. She thought &s;omething was in the wind, when my brother came into my dining here &s;o readily. Her young ma&s;ter was too
<PB N="305" REF="309">
hard for every-body. 'Squire Lovelace him&s;elf was nothing at all at a quick thought, to her young ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>My aunt mention'd Mr. Lovelace's boa&s;ting beha|viour to <HI>his</HI> &s;ervants: Perhaps he <HI>may</HI> be &s;o mean. But as to my brother, he always took a pride in making him&s;elf appear to be a man of parts and learn|ing to our &s;ervants. <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Meanne&s;s,</HI> I have often thought, are as nearly ally'd, and as clo&s;e borderers upon each other, as the poet tells us <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Mad|ne&s;s</HI> are.</P>
<P>But why do I trouble you (and my&s;elf, at &s;uch a cri|&s;is) with the&s;e impertinencies?&mdash;Yet I would forget, if I could, the neare&s;t evil, the interview; becau&s;e, my apprehen&s;ions increa&s;ing, as the hour is at hand, I &s;hould, were my attention to be ingro&s;&s;ed by them, be unfit to &s;ee him, if he does come: And then he will have too much advantage over me, as he will have &s;eeming rea&s;on to reproach me with change of re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The <HI>upbraider,</HI> you know, my dear, is in &s;ome &s;en&s;e a &s;uperior; while the <HI>upbraided,</HI> if with rea&s;on upbraided, mu&s;t make a figure as &s;piritle&s;s as con|&s;cious.</P>
<P>I know that this wretch will, if he <HI>can,</HI> be his own judge, and <HI>mine</HI> too. But the latter he &s;hall <HI>not</HI> be.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay, we &s;hall be all to pieces. But I don't care for that. It would be hard, if I, who have held it out &s;o &s;turdily to my father and uncles, &s;hould not&mdash;But he is at the garden-door&mdash;</P>
<P>I was mi&s;taken!&mdash;How may noi&s;es <HI>un</HI>-like, be made <HI>like</HI> what one fears!&mdash;Why flutters the fool &s;o!&mdash;</P>
<P>I will ha&s;ten to depo&s;ite this. Then I will, for the la&s;t time, go to the u&s;ual place, in hopes to find, that he has got my letter. If he <HI>has,</HI> I will not meet him. If he has <HI>not,</HI> I will take it back, and &s;hew him what
<PB N="306" REF="310">
I have written. That will break the ice, as I may &s;ay, and &s;ave me much circumlocution and rea&s;on|ing: And a &s;tedfa&s;t adherence to that my written mind is all that will be nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;The interview mu&s;t be as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible; for &s;hould it be di&s;co|ver'd, it would furni&s;h a new and &s;trong pretence for the intended evil of Wedne&s;day next.</P>
<P>Perhaps I &s;hall not be able to write again one while. Perhaps not, till I am the mi&s;erable property of that Solmes!&mdash;But that &s;hall never, never be, while I have my &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>If your &s;ervant find nothing from me by Wed|ne&s;day morning, you may conclude, that I can then neither write to you, nor receive your favours.&mdash;</P>
<P>In that ca&s;e, pity and pray for me, my beloved friend, and continue to me that place in your affe|ction, which is the pride of my life, and the only comfort left to</P>

<P>I am bu&s;ying my&s;elf to give you the particulars at large. The whole twenty-four hours of each day (to begin the moment I can fix) &s;hall be imployed in it till it is fini&s;hed: Every-one of the hours, I mean, that will be &s;pared me, by this interrupting man, to

whom I have made my&s;elf &s;o fooli&s;hly accountable for too many of them. Re&s;t is departed from me. I have no call for That: And That has no balm for the wounds of my mind. So you'll have all tho&s;e hours, without interruption, till the account is ended.</P>
<P>But will you receive, &s;hall you be <HI>permitted</HI> to re|ceive, my letters, after what I have done?</P>
<P>O, my deare&s;t friend!&mdash;But I mu&s;t make the be&s;t of it. I hope that will not be very bad! Yet am I convinced, that I did a ra&s;h, an inexcu&s;able thing, in meeting him; and all his tenderne&s;s, all his vows, cannot pacify my inward reproaches on that account.</P>
<P>The bearer comes to you, my dear, for the little parcel of linen, which I &s;ent you with far better and more agreeeble hopes.</P>
<P>Send not my letters. Send the linen only: Ex|cept you will favour me with one line, to tell me, you will love me &s;till; and that you will &s;u&s;pend your cen&s;ures, till you have the whole before you. I am the readier to &s;end thus early, becau&s;e if you have de|po&s;ited any-thing for me, you may cau&s;e it to be taken back, or withhold any-thing you had but intended to &s;end.</P>
<P>Adieu, my deare&s;t friend!&mdash;I be&s;eech you to love me &s;till!&mdash;But, alas! what will your mamma &s;ay?&mdash;What will mine!&mdash;What my other relations?&mdash;and what my dear Mrs. Norton? And how will my bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter triumph?&mdash;</P>
<P>I cannot at pre&s;ent tell you how, or where, you can direct to me. For very early &s;hall I leave this place; harra&s;&s;ed and fatigued to death! But, when I can do nothing el&s;e, con&s;tant u&s;e has made me able to write. Long, very long, has that been all my amu&s;ement and plea&s;ure: Yet could not that have been &s;uch to me, had I not had you, my be&s;t-beloved friend, to write to. Once more adieu.
