<P>WELL, well, Si&s;ter, have a little patience and the&s;e holidays will be over; and the boy then goes back to &s;chool and all will be quiet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, till the next breaking up, no, no, brother, unle&s;s he is &s;everely puni&s;h'd for what he has already done, depend upon it, this vicious humour will be confirmed into habit, and his follies increa&s;e in proportion with his years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now wou'dn't any one think to hear you talk, that my &s;on had actually &s;ome vice in him? for my part I own there is &s;omething &s;o whim&s;ical in all his tricks that I can't in my heart but forgive him, aye and for aught I know love him the better into the bargain.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mi&s;s P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes truly&mdash;becau&s;e you have never been a &s;ufferer by them&mdash;had you been rendered rediculous as I have been by his tricks as you call 'em, you wou'd have been the fir&s;t to complain and to puni&s;h.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, as to that, he hasn't &s;par'd even his father, is there a day pa&s;&s;es I do not break my &s;hins over &s;tumbling-blocks he lays in my way?&mdash;why there isn't a door in the hou&s;e but is arm'd with a ba&s;on of water on top, and left ju&s;t a jarr&mdash;&s;o that I can't walk over my own hou&s;e without running the hazard of a &s;hower bath, or being wet through.</P>

<P>Aye, no wonder the child's &s;poil'd &mdash;&s;ince you will &s;uperintend his education your&s;elf, you indeed.</P>

<P>Now wou'd you rail at me for the di&s;po&s;ition I was born with? can I help it if the Gods have made me poetical as the divine bard &s;ays.</P>

<P>Made you Poetical indeed, 'Sblood if you had been born in a &s;treet near a college, or even next door to a day &s;chool, I &s;hou'dn't have been &s;urpri&s;ed; but damn it madam, what had you to do with poetry and &s;tuff.</P>

<P>If you had the &s;malle&s;t &s;park of ta&s;te you wou'd admire the effu&s;ions of Mr Tagg's pen, and be enchanted with his admirable acting as much as I am&mdash;but as to this &s;tory it may &s;erve as another &s;ample of my nephew's &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, to coin ba&s;e fal&s;ehoods again&s;t his aunt's character.</P>
