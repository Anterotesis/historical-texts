<P>AN ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE round the WORLD, IN THE YEARS MDCCLXVIII, MDCCLXIX, MDCCLXX, and MDCCLXXI. By LIEUTENANT JAMES COOK, Commander of his Maje&s;ty's Bark the ENDEAVOUR.</P>

<PB REF="8">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I Have in the General Introduction to this work men|tioned the rea&s;ons why the Narratives of the &s;everal Voyages are written in the per&s;on of the Commanders, upon what ground liberty has been taken to introduce &s;uch &s;entiments as the events &s;ugge&s;ted to me, and what the materials were from which my work has been drawn up. It has al&s;o been &s;aid, that with re&s;pect to the Voyage of the Endeavour, I had &s;till farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and of this I am now to give an account.</P>
<P>On board this ve&s;&s;el embarked Jo&s;eph Banks E&s;quire, a Gentleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of con&s;iderable landed property in Lincoln&s;hire. He received the education of a &s;cholar ra|ther to qualify him for the enjoyments than the labours of life; yet an ardent de&s;ire to know more of Nature than could be learnt from books, determined him, at a very early age, to forego what are generally thought to be the principal advantages of a liberal fortune, and to apply his revenue not in procuring the plea&s;ures of lei|&s;ure and ea&s;e, but in the pur&s;uit of his favourite &s;tudy, through a &s;eries of fatigue and danger, which, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, have very &s;eldom been voluntarily incurred,
<PB N="xii" REF="9">
except to gratify the re&s;tle&s;s and in&s;atiable de&s;ires of ava|rice or ambition.</P>
<P>Upon his leaving the univer&s;ity of Oxford, in the year 1763, he cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, and vi&s;ited the coa&s;ts of New|foundland and Labradore. The danger, difficulty, and in|convenience that attend long voyages are very different in idea and experience; Mr. Banks however returned, undi&s;couraged, from his fir&s;t expedition; and when he found that the Endeavour was equipping for a voyage to the South Seas, in order to ob&s;erve the Tran&s;it of Venus, and afterwards attempt farther di&s;coveries, he determined to embark in the expedition, that he might enrich his na|tive country with a tribute of knowlege from tho&s;e which have been hitherto unknown, and not without hope of leaving among the rude and uncultivated nations that he might di&s;cover, &s;omething that would render life of more value, and enrich them perhaps in a certain degree with the knowlege, or at lea&s;t with the productions, of Europe.</P>
<P>As he was determined to &s;pare no expence in the exe|cution of his plan, he engaged Dr. Solander to accompany him in the voyage. This Gentleman, by birth a Swede, was educated under the celebrated Linnaeus, from whom he brought letters of recommendation into England, and his merit, being &s;oon known, he obtained an appointment in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;aeum, a public in&s;titution which was then ju&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed; &s;uch a companion Mr. Banks con|&s;idered as an acqui&s;ition of no &s;mall importance, and to his great &s;atisfaction the event abundantly proved that
<PB N="xiii" REF="10">
he was not mi&s;taken. He al&s;o took with him two drafts|men, one to delineate views and figures, the other to paint &s;uch &s;ubjects of natural hi&s;tory as might offer; to|gether with a &s;ecretary and four &s;ervants, two of whom were negroes.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks kept an accurate and circum&s;tantial journal of the voyage, and, &s;oon after I had received that of Captain Cook from the Admiralty, was &s;o obliging as to put it into my hands, with permi&s;&s;ion to take out of it whatever I thought would improve or embelli&s;h the narrative. This was an offer of which I gladly and thankfully accepted: I knew the ad|vantage would be great, for few philo&s;ophers have fur|ni&s;hed materials for accounts of voyages undertaken to di&s;|cover new countries. The adventurers in &s;uch expeditions have generally looked only upon the great outline of Na|ture, without attending to the variety of &s;hades within, which give life and beauty to the piece.</P>
<P>The papers of Captain Cook contained a very particular account of all the nautical incidents of the voyage, and a very minute de&s;cription of the figure and extent of the countries he had vi&s;ited, with the bearings of the head|lands and bays that diver&s;ify the coa&s;ts, the &s;ituation of the harbours in which &s;hipping may obtain refre&s;hments, with the depth of water wherever there were &s;oundings; the latitudes, longitudes, variation of the needle, and &s;uch other particulars as lay in his department; and abundantly &s;hewed him to be an excellent officer, and &s;kilful navi|gator.
<PB N="xiv" REF="11">
But in the papers, which were communicated to me by Mr. Banks, I found a great variety of incidents which had not come under the notice of Captain Cook, with de&s;criptions of countries and people, their produc|tions, manners, cu&s;toms, religion, policy, and language, much more full and particular than were expected from a Gentleman who&s;e &s;tation and office naturally turned his principal attention to other objects; for the&s;e particulars, therefore, be&s;ides many practical ob&s;ervations, the Public is indebted to Mr. Banks. To Mr. Banks al&s;o the Public is indebted for the de&s;igns of the engravings which illu&s;|&s;trate and adorn the account of this voyage, all of them, except the maps, charts, and views of the coa&s;ts as they appear at &s;ea, being copied from his valuable drawings, and &s;ome of them from &s;uch as were made for the u&s;e of the arti&s;ts at his expence.</P>
<P>As the materials furni&s;hed by Mr. Banks were &s;o intere&s;t|ing and copious, there aro&s;e an objection again&s;t writing an account of this voyage in the per&s;on of the Commander, which could have no place with re&s;pect to the others; the de&s;criptions and ob&s;ervations of Mr. Banks would be ab&s;orbed without any di&s;tinction, in a general narrative given under another name: but this objection he gene|rou&s;ly over-ruled, and it therefore became nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account of the obligations which he has laid upon the Public and my&s;elf in this place. It is indeed fortunate for mankind, when wealth and &s;cience, and a
<PB N="xv" REF="12">
&s;trong inclination to exert the powers of both for pur|po&s;es of public benefit, unite in the &s;ame per&s;on; and I cannot but congratulate my country upon the pro&s;pect of further plea&s;ure and advantage from the &s;ame Gentleman, to whom we are indebted for &s;o con&s;iderable a part of this narrative.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Pa&s;&s;age from Plymouth to Madeira, with &s;ome account of that I&s;land.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING received my commi&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. May. Friday 27.</NOTE> which was dated the 25th of May 1768, I went on board on the 27th, hoi&s;ted the pennant, and took charge of the &s;hip, which then lay in the ba&s;on in Deptford Yard. She was fitted for &s;ea with all expedition; and &s;tores and provi&s;ions being taken on board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sat. July 30.</NOTE> &s;ailed down the river on the 30th of July,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sat. Aug. 13.</NOTE> and on the 13th of Augu&s;t anchored in Plymouth Sound.</P>
<P>While we lay here waiting for a wind, the articles of war and the act of parliament were read to the &s;hip's company, who were paid two months wages in advance, and told that they were to expect no additional pay for the performance of the voyage.</P>
<P>On Friday the 26th of Augu&s;t, the wind becoming fair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 26.</NOTE> we got under &s;ail, and put to &s;ea. On the 31&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 31.</NOTE> we &s;aw &s;everal of the birds which the &s;ailors call Mother Carey's
<PB N="2" REF="15">
Chickens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. September. Thur&s;day 1.</NOTE> and which they &s;uppo&s;e to be the forerunners of a &s;torm; and on the next day we had a very hard gale, which brought us under our cour&s;es, wa&s;hed over-board a &s;mall boat belonging to the Boat&s;wain, and drowned three or four dozen of our poultry, which we regretted &s;till more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 2.</NOTE>On Friday the 2d of September we &s;aw land, between Cape Fini&s;ter and Cape Ortegal, on the coa&s;t of Gallicia, in Spain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 5.</NOTE> and on the 5th, by an ob&s;ervation of the &s;un and moon, we found the latitude of Cape Fini&s;ter to be 42&deg; 53&prime; North, and its longitude 8&deg; 46&prime; We&s;t, our fir&s;t meridian being always &s;uppo&s;ed to pa&s;s through Greenwich; variation of the needle 21&deg; 4&prime; We&s;t.</P>
<P>During this cour&s;e, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had an opportunity of ob&s;erving many marine animals, of which no naturali&s;t has hitherto taken notice; particularly, a new &s;pe|cies of the <HI>Oni&s;cus,</HI> which was found adhering to the <HI>Medu&s;a Pelagica;</HI> and an animal of an angular figure, about three inches long and one thick, with a hollow pa&s;&s;ing quite through it, and a brown &s;pot on one end, which they con|jectured might be its &s;tomach; four of the&s;e adhered to|gether by their &s;ides when they were taken, &s;o that at fir&s;t they were thought to be one animal, but upon being put into a gla&s;s of water they &s;oon &s;eparated, and &s;wam about very bri&s;kly. The&s;e animals are of a new genus, to which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander gave the name of <HI>Dagy&s;a,</HI> from the likene&s;s of one &s;pecies of them to a gem: &s;everal &s;pe|cimens of them were taken adhering together &s;ometimes to the length of a yard or more, and &s;hining in the water with very beautiful colours. Another animal of a new genus they al&s;o di&s;covered, which &s;hone in the water with colours &s;till more beautiful and vivid, and which indeed exceeded in variety and brightne&s;s any thing that we had ever &s;een: the colouring and &s;plendour of the&s;e animals were equal to tho&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="16">
of an Opal, and from their re&s;emblance to that gem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. September.</NOTE> the genus was called <HI>Carcinium Opalinum.</HI> One of them lived &s;everal hours in a gla&s;s of &s;alt water, &s;wimming about with great agility, and at every motion di&s;playing a change of co|lours almo&s;t infinitely various. We caught al&s;o among the rigging of the &s;hip, when we were at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues from Cape Fini&s;ter, &s;everal birds which have not been de&s;cribed by Linnaeus; they were &s;uppo&s;ed to have come from Spain, and our gentlemen called the &s;pecies <HI>Motacilla velificans,</HI> as they &s;aid none but &s;ailors would venture them|&s;elves on board a &s;hip that was going round the world: one of them was &s;o exhau&s;ted that it died in Mr. Banks's hand, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was brought to him.</P>
<P>It was thought extraordinary that no naturali&s;t had hitherto taken notice of the <HI>Dagy&s;a,</HI> as the &s;ea abounds with them not twenty leagues from the coa&s;t of Spain; but, unfortunately for the cau&s;e of &s;cience, there are but very few of tho&s;e who traver&s;e the &s;ea, that are either di&s;po&s;ed or qualified to re|mark the curio&s;ities of which Nature has made it the repo|&s;itory.</P>
<P>On the 12th we di&s;covered the i&s;lands of Porto Santo and Madeira, and on the next day anchored in Funchiale road,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 12.</NOTE> and moored with the &s;tream-anchor: but, in the night, the bend of the haw&s;er of the &s;tream-anchor &s;lipped, owing to the negligence of the per&s;on who had been employed to make it fa&s;t. In the morning the anchor was heaved up into the boat, and carried out to the &s;outhward; but in heaving it again, Mr. Weir, the ma&s;ter's mate, was carried overboard by the buoy-rope, and went to the bottom with the anchor: the people in the &s;hip &s;aw the accident, and got the anchor up with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; it was however too late, the body came up intangled in the buoy-rope, but it was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="17"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. September.</NOTE>When the i&s;land of Madeira is fir&s;t approached from the &s;ea, it has a very beautiful appearance; the &s;ides of the hills being intirely covered with vines almo&s;t as high as the eye can di&s;tingui&s;h, and the vines are green when every kind of herbage, except where they &s;hade the ground, and here and there by the &s;ides of a rill, is intirely burnt up, which was the ca&s;e at this time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 13.</NOTE>On the 13th, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, a boat, which our &s;ailors call the product boat, came on board from the officers of health, without who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion no per&s;on is &s;uffered to land from on board a &s;hip. As &s;oon as this per|mi&s;&s;ion was obtained, we went on &s;hore at Funchiale, the capital of the i&s;land, and proceeded directly to the hou&s;e of Mr. Cheap, who is the Engli&s;h con&s;ul there, and one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable merchants of the place. This gentleman received us with the kindne&s;s of a brother, and the liberality of a prince; he in&s;i&s;ted upon our taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e, in which he furni&s;hed us with every po&s;&s;ible accom|modation during our &s;tay upon the i&s;land: he procured leave for Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to &s;earch the i&s;land for &s;uch natural curio&s;ities as they &s;hould think worth their notice; employed per&s;ons to take fi&s;h and gather &s;hells, which time would not have permitted them to collect for them&s;elves; and he provided hor&s;es and guides to take them to any part of the country which they &s;hould chu&s;e to vi&s;it. With all the&s;e advantages, however, their excur&s;ions were &s;eldom pu&s;hed farther than three miles from the town, as they were only five days on &s;hore; one of which they &s;pent at home, in receiving the honour of a vi&s;it from the governor. The &s;ea&s;on was the wor&s;t in the year for their purpo&s;e, as it was neither that of plants nor in&s;ects; a few of the plants, how|ever, were procured in flower, by the kind attention of Dr.

Heberden, the chief phy&s;ician of the i&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. September.</NOTE> and brother to Dr. Heberden of London, who al&s;o gave them &s;uch &s;peci|mens as he had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and a copy of his Botanical Ob&s;ervations; containing, among other things, a particular de&s;cription of the trees of the i&s;land. Mr. Banks enquired after the wood which has been imported into England for cabinet work, and is here called Madeira mahogany: he learnt that no wood was exported from the i&s;land under that name, but he found a tree called by the natives Vigniatico, the <HI>Laurus indicus</HI> of Linnaeus, the wood of which cannot ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from mahogany. Dr. Heberden has a book-ca&s;e in which the vigniatico and mahogany are mixed, and they are no otherwi&s;e to be known from each other than by the colour, which, upon a nice examination, appears to be &s;omewhat le&s;s brown in the vigniatico than the mahogany; it is therefore in the highe&s;t degree pro|bable, that the wood known in England by the name of Madeira mahogany, is the vigniatico.</P>
<P>There is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that this whole i&s;land was, at &s;ome remote period, thrown up by the explo&s;ion of &s;ubterraneous fire, as every &s;tone, whether whole or in frag|ments, that we &s;aw upon it appeared to have been burnt, and even the &s;and it&s;elf to be nothing more than a&s;hes: we did not, indeed, &s;ee much of the country, but the people informed us that what we did &s;ee was a very exact &s;pecimen of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The only article of trade in this i&s;land is wine, and the manner in which it is made is &s;o &s;imple, that it might have been u&s;ed by Noah, who is &s;aid to have planted the fir&s;t vineyard after the &s;tood: the grapes are put into a &s;quare wooden ve&s;&s;el, the dimen&s;ions of which are proportioned to the &s;ize of the vineyard to which it belongs; the &s;ervants

The inhabitants have made &s;o little improvement in knowlege or art, that they have but very lately brought all the fruit of a vineyard to be of one &s;ort, by engrafting their vines: there &s;eems to be in mind as there is in matter, a kind of <HI>vis inertioe,</HI> which re&s;i&s;ts the fir&s;t impul&s;e to change. He who propo&s;es to a&s;&s;i&s;t the artificer or the hu&s;bandman by a new application of the principles of philo&s;ophy, or the powers of mechani&s;m, will find, that his having hitherto done without them, will be a &s;tronger motive for continuing to do without them &s;till, than any advantage, however manife&s;t and con&s;iderable, for adopting the improvement. Wherever there is ignorance there is prejudice; and the common people of all nations are, with re&s;pect to improvements, like the pari&s;h poor of England with re&s;pect to a maintenance, for whom the law mu&s;t not only make a provi&s;ion, but compel them to accept it, or el&s;e they will be &s;till found begging in the &s;treets. It was therefore with great difficulty that the people of Madeira were per&s;uaded to engraft their vines, and &s;ome of them &s;till ob&s;tinately refu&s;e to adopt the practice, though a whole vin|tage is very often &s;poiled by the number of bad grapes which are mixed in the vat, and which they will not throw out, becau&s;e they increa&s;e the quantity of the wine: an in&s;tance of the force of habit, which is the more extraor|dinary, as they have adopted the practice of engrafting with re&s;pect to their che&s;nut-trees, an object of much le&s;s impor|tance, which, however, are thus brought to bear &s;ooner than they would otherwi&s;e have done.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="20">We &s;aw no wheel-carriages of any &s;ort in the place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. September.</NOTE> which perhaps is not more owing to the want of ingenuity to invent them, than to the want of indu&s;try to mend the roads, which, at pre&s;ent, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any wheel-carriage &s;hould pa&s;s: the inhabitants have hor&s;es and mules indeed, excel|lently adapted to &s;uch ways; but their wine is, notwith|&s;tanding, brought to town from the vineyards where it is made, in ve&s;&s;els of goat-&s;kins, which are carried by men upon their heads. The only imitation of a carriage among the&s;e people is a board, made &s;omewhat hollow in the mid|dle, to one end of which a pole is tied, by a &s;trap of whit|leather: this wretched &s;ledge approaches about as near to an Engli&s;h cart, as an Indian canoe to a &s;hip's long-boat; and even this would probably never have been thought of, if the Engli&s;h had not introduced wine ve&s;&s;els which are too big to be carried by hand, and which, therefore, are dragged about the town upon the&s;e machines.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on, perhaps, why art and indu&s;try have done &s;o little for Madeira is, Nature's having done &s;o much. The &s;oil is very rich, and there is &s;uch a difference of climate between the plains and the hills, that there is &s;carcely a &s;ingle object of luxury that grows either in Europe or the Indies, that might not be produced here. When we went to vi&s;it Dr. Heberden, who lives upon a con&s;iderable a&s;cent, about two miles from town, we left the thermometer at 74, and when we arrived at his hou&s;e, we found it at 66. The hills produce, almo&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly, walnuts, che&s;nuts, and apples in great abundance; and in the town there are many plants which are the natives both of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t In|dies, particularly the banana, the guava, the pine-apple or anana, and the mango, which flouri&s;h almo&s;t without cul|ture. The corn of this country is of a mo&s;t excellent qua|lity, large grained and very fine, and the i&s;land would produce
<PB N="8" REF="21">
it in great plenty;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. September.</NOTE> yet mo&s;t of what is con&s;umed by the in|habitants is imported. The mutton, pork, and beef are al&s;o very good; the beef in particular, which we took on board here, was univer&s;ally allowed to be &s;carcely inferior to our own; the lean part was very like it, both in colour and grain, though the bea&s;ts are much &s;maller, but the fat is as white as the fat of mutton.</P>
<P>The town of Funchiale derives its name from <HI>Funcho,</HI> the Portugue&s;e name for fennel, which grows in great plenty upon the neighbouring rocks, and, by the ob&s;ervation of Dr. Heberden, lies in the latitude of 32&deg; 33&prime; 33&Prime; N. and lon|gitude 16&deg; 49&prime; W. It is &s;ituated in the bottom of a bay, and though larger than the extent of the i&s;land &s;eems to de&s;erve, is very ill built; the hou&s;es of the principal inhabitants are large, tho&s;e of the common people are &s;mall, the &s;treets are narrow, and wor&s;e paved than any I ever &s;aw. The churches are loaded with ornaments, among which are many pic|tures, and images of favourite &s;aints, but the pictures are in general wretchedly painted, and the &s;aints are dre&s;&s;ed in laced clothes. Some of the convents are in a better ta&s;te, e&s;pecially that of the Franci&s;cans, which is plain, &s;imple, and neat in the highe&s;t degree. The infirmary in particular drew our attention as a model which might be adopted in other countries with great advantage. It con&s;i&s;ts of a long room, on one &s;ide of which are the windows, and an altar for the convenience of admini&s;tering the &s;acrament to the &s;ick: the other &s;ide is divided into wards, each of which is ju&s;t big enough to contain a bed, and neatly lined with gally-tiles; behind the&s;e wards, and parallel to the room in which they &s;tand, there runs a long gallery, with which each ward communicates by a door, &s;o that the &s;ick may be &s;eparately &s;upplied with whatever they want without di&s;|turbing their neighbours. In this convent there is al&s;o a
<PB N="9" REF="22">
&s;ingular curio&s;ity of another kind; a &s;mall chapel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. September.</NOTE> the whole lining of which, both &s;ides and ceiling, is compo&s;ed of hu|man &s;culls and thigh bones; the thigh bones are laid acro&s;s each other, and a &s;cull is placed in each of the four angles. Among the &s;culls one is very remarkable; the upper and the lower jaw, on one &s;ide, perfectly and firmly cohere; how the o&s;&s;ification which unites them was formed, it is not perhaps very ea&s;y to conceive, but it is certain that the pa|tient mu&s;t have lived &s;ome time without opening his mouth: what nouri&s;hment he received was conveyed through a hole which we di&s;covered to have been made on the other &s;ide, by forcing out &s;ome of the teeth, in doing which the jaw al&s;o &s;eems to have been injured.</P>
<P>We vi&s;ited the good Fathers of this convent on a Thur&s;day evening, ju&s;t before &s;upper-time, and they received us with great politene&s;s; <Q>We will not a&s;k you, &s;aid they, to &s;up with us, becau&s;e we are not prepared, but if you will come to-morrow, though it is a fa&s;t with us, we will have a turkey roa&s;ted for you.</Q> This invitation, which &s;hewed a liberality of &s;entiment not to have been expected in a con|vent of Portugue&s;e Friars at this place, gratified us much, though it was not in our power to accept it.</P>
<P>We vi&s;ited al&s;o a convent of nuns, dedicated to <HI>Santa Clara,</HI> and the Ladies did us the honour to expre&s;s a particular plea&s;ure in &s;eeing us there: they had heard that there were great philo&s;ophers among us, and not at all knowing what were the objects of philo&s;ophical knowlege, they a&s;ked us &s;everal que&s;tions that were ab&s;urd and extravagant in the highe&s;t degree; one was, when it would thunder; and ano|ther, whether a &s;pring of fre&s;h water was to be found any where within the walls of their convent, of which it &s;eems they were in great want. It will naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed that our an&s;wers to &s;uch que&s;tions were neither &s;atisfactory to
<PB N="10" REF="23">
the Ladies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. September.</NOTE> nor, in their e&s;timation, honourable to us; yet their di&s;appointment did not in the lea&s;t le&s;&s;en their civility, and they talked, without cea&s;ing, during the whole of our vi&s;it, which la&s;ted about half an hour.</P>
<P>The hills of this country are very high; the highe&s;t, Pico Ruivo, ri&s;es 5,068 feet, near an Engli&s;h mile, perpendicu|larly from its ba&s;e, which is much higher than any land that has been mea&s;ured in Great Britain. The &s;ides of the&s;e hills are covered with vines to a certain height, above which there are woods of che&s;nut and pine of immen&s;e extent, and above them fore&s;ts of wild timber of various kinds not known in Europe; particularly two, called by the Portugue&s;e <HI>Mirmulano</HI> and <HI>Paobranco,</HI> the leaves of both which, particu|larly the <HI>Paobranco,</HI> are &s;o beautiful, that the&s;e trees would be a great ornament to the gardens of Europe.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in this i&s;land is &s;uppo&s;ed to be about 80,000, and the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e duties produce a reve|nue to the king of Portugal of 20,000 pounds a-year, clear of all expences, which might ea&s;ily be doubled by the pro|duct of the i&s;land, exclu&s;ive of the vines, if advantage was taken of the excellence of the climate, and the amazing fertility of the &s;oil; but this object is utterly neglected by the Portugue&s;e. In the trade of the inhabitants of Madeira with Li&s;bon the balance is again&s;t them, &s;o that all the Por|tugue&s;e money naturally going thither, the currency of the i&s;land is Spani&s;h; there are indeed a few Portugue&s;e pieces of copper, but they are &s;o &s;carce that we did not &s;ee one of them: the Spani&s;h coin is of three denominations; Pi&s;te|reens, worth about a &s;hilling; Bitts, worth about &s;ix pence; and Half-bitts, three pence.</P>

The height of this mountain, from which I took a new departure, has been determined by Dr. Heberden, who has been upon it, to be 15,396 feet, which is but 148 yards le&s;s than three miles, reckoning the mile at 1760 yards. Its appearance at &s;un&s;et was very &s;triking; when the &s;un was below the horizon, and the re&s;t of the i&s;land appeared of a deep black, the mountain &s;till reflected his rays, and glowed with a warmth of colour which no painting can expre&s;s. There is no eruption of vi&s;ible fire from it, but a heat i&s;&s;ues from the chinks near the top, too &s;trong to be borne by the hand when it is held near them. We had received from Dr. Heberden, among other favours, &s;ome &s;alt which he collected on the top of the mountain, where it is found in large quantities, and which he &s;uppo&s;es to be the true <HI>natrum</HI> or <HI>nitrum</HI> of the ancients: he gave us

<P>As &s;everal articles of our &s;tock and provi&s;ions now began to fall &s;hort, I determined to put into Rio de Janeiro, rather than at any port in Brazil or Falkland's I&s;lands, knowing that it could better &s;upply us with what we wanted, and making no doubt but that we &s;hould be well received.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 8.</NOTE>On the 8th, at day-break, we &s;aw the coa&s;t of Brazil, and about ten o'clock we brought to, and &s;poke with a fi&s;hing-boat;
<PB N="17" REF="30">
the people on board told us that the land which we &s;aw, lay to the &s;outhward of <HI>Sancto E&s;pirito,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. November.</NOTE> but belonged to the captain&s;hip of that place.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on board this ve&s;&s;el, in which they found eleven men, nine of whom were Blacks; they all fi&s;hed with lines, and their fre&s;h cargo, the chief part of which Mr. Banks bought, con&s;i&s;ted of dol|phins, large pelagic &s;combers of two kinds, &s;ea bream, and &s;ome of the fi&s;h which in the We&s;t Indies are called Wel&s;h|men. Mr. Banks had taken Spani&s;h &s;ilver with him, which he imagined to be the currency of the continent, but to his great &s;urprize the people a&s;ked him for Engli&s;h &s;hillings; he gave them two which he happened to have about him, and it was not without &s;ome di&s;pute that they took the re&s;t of the money in pi&s;tereens. Their bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eemed to be to catch large fi&s;h at a good di&s;tance from the &s;hore, which they &s;alted in bulk, in a place made for that purpo&s;e in the middle of their boat: of this merchandize they had about two quintals on board, which they offered for about 16 &s;hil|lings, and would probably have &s;old for half the money. The fre&s;h fi&s;h, which was bought for about nineteen &s;hil|lings and &s;ix pence, &s;erved the whole &s;hip's company; the &s;alt was not wanted.</P>
<P>The &s;ea provi&s;ion of the&s;e fi&s;hermen con&s;i&s;ted of nothing more than a ca&s;k of water, and a bag of Ca&s;&s;ada flour, which they called <HI>Farinha de Pao,</HI> or wooden flour, which indeed is a name which very well &s;uits its ta&s;te and appear|ance. Their water ca&s;k was large, as wide as their boat, and exactly fitted a place that was made for it in the balla&s;t; it was impo&s;&s;ible therefore to draw out any of its contents by a tap, the &s;ides being, from the bottom to the top, wholly inacce&s;&s;ible; neither could any be taken out by dipping a

November.</NOTE> for an opening &s;ufficiently wide for that purpo&s;e would have endangered the lo&s;s of great part of it by the rolling of the ve&s;&s;el: their expedient to get at their water, &s;o &s;ituated, was curious; when one of them wanted to drink, he applied to his neighbour, who accom|panied him to the water ca&s;k with a hollow cane about three feet long, which was open at both ends; this he thru&s;t into the ca&s;k through a &s;mall hole in the top, and then, &s;topping the upper end with the palm of his hand, drew it out; the pre&s;&s;ure of the air again&s;t the other end keeping in the wa|ter which it contained; to this end the per&s;on who wanted to drink applied his mouth, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tant then taking his hand from the other, and admitting the air above, the cane immediately parted with its contents, which the drinker drew off till he was &s;atisfied.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 12.</NOTE>We &s;tood off and on along the &s;hore till the 12th, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;aw a remarkable hill near Santo E&s;pirito, then Cape St. Thomas, and then an i&s;land ju&s;t without Cape Trio, which in &s;ome maps is called the i&s;land of Trio, and which being high, with a hollow in the middle, has the appear|ance of two i&s;lands when &s;een at a di&s;tance. On this day we &s;tood along the &s;hor for Rio de Janeiro, and at nine the next morning made &s;ail for the harbour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 13.</NOTE> I then &s;ent Mr. Hicks, my fir&s;t Lieutenant, before us in the pinnace, up to the city, to acquaint the Governor, that we put in there to procure water and refre&s;hments; and to de&s;ire the a&s;&s;i&s;tance. of a pilot to bring us into proper anchoring ground. I continued to &s;tand up the river, tru&s;ting to Mr. Belli&s;le's draught, publi&s;hed in the <HI>Petit Atlas maritime,</HI> Vol. II, N&deg; 54, which we found very good, till five o'clock in the even|ing, expecting the return of my Lieutenant; and ju&s;t as I was about to anchor, above the i&s;land of Cobras, which lies be|fore
<PB N="19" REF="32">
the city, the pinnace came back without him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. November.</NOTE> having on board a Portugue&s;e officer, but no pilot. The people in the boat told me, that my Lieutenant was detained by the Viceroy till I &s;hould go on &s;hore. We came immediately to an anchor; and, almo&s;t at the &s;ame time, a ten oared boat, full of &s;oldiers, came up and kept rowing round the &s;hip, without exchanging a word: in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour, another boat came on board with &s;everal of the Vice|roy's officers, who a&s;ked, Whence we came; what was our cargo; the number of men and guns on board; the object of our voyage, and &s;everal other que&s;tions, which we di|rectly and truly an&s;wered: they then told me, as a kind of apology for detaining my Lieutenant, and putting an officer on board my pinnace, that it was the invariable cu&s;tom of the place, to detain the fir&s;t officer who came on &s;hore from any &s;hip on her arrival, till a boat from the Viceroy had vi&s;ited her, and to &s;uffer no boat to go either from or to a &s;hip, while &s;he lay there, without having a &s;oldier on board. They &s;aid that I might go on &s;hore when I plea&s;ed; but wi&s;hed that every other per&s;on might remain on board till the paper which they &s;hould draw up had been delivered to the Viceroy, promi&s;ing that, immediately upon their return, the Lieutenant &s;hould be &s;ent on board.</P>
<P>This promi&s;e was performed; and, on the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 14.</NOTE> the 14th, I went on &s;hore, and obtained leave of the Vice|roy to purcha&s;e provi&s;ions and refre&s;hments for the &s;hip, provided I would employ one of their own people as a factor, but not otherwi&s;e. I made &s;ome objections to this, but he in&s;i&s;ted upon it as the cu&s;tom of the place. I objected al&s;o again&s;t the putting a &s;oldier into the boat every time &s;he went between the &s;hip and the &s;hore; but he told me, that this was done by the expre&s;s orders of his court, with which he could in no ca&s;e di&s;pen&s;e. I then reque&s;ted, that the Gentlemen
<PB N="20" REF="33">
whom I had on board might re&s;ide on &s;hore during our &s;tay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. November.</NOTE> and that Mr. Banks might go up the country to gather plants; but this he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. I judged from his extreme caution, and the &s;everity of the&s;e re&s;trictions, that he &s;u&s;|pected we were come to trade; I therefore took &s;ome pains to convince him of the contrary. I told him, that we were bound to the &s;outhward, by the order of his Britannic Ma|je&s;ty, to ob&s;erve a tran&s;it of the planet Venus over the Sun, an a&s;tronomical phaenomenon of great importance to navi|gation. Of the tran&s;it of Venus, however, he could form no other conception, than that it was the pa&s;&s;ing of the North Star through the South Pole; for the&s;e are the very words of his interpreter, who was a Swede, and &s;poke Engli&s;h very well. I did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion for the Gentlemen to come on &s;hore during the day, or that, when I was on &s;hore my&s;elf, I might be at liberty, taking for granted that nothing was intended to the contrary; but in this I was unfortunately mi&s;taken. As &s;oon as I took leave of his Excellency, I found an officer who had orders to at|tend me wherever I went: of this I de&s;ired an explanation, and was told that it was meant as a compliment; I earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed from accepting &s;uch an honour, but the good Viceroy would by no means &s;uffer it to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>With this officer, therefore, I returned on board, about twelve o'clock, where I was impatiently expected by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who made no doubt but that a fair account of us having been given by the officers who had been on board the evening before, in their paper called a <HI>Practica,</HI> and every &s;cruple of the Viceroy removed in my conference with his Excellency, they &s;hould immediately be at liberty to go on &s;hore, and di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves as they plea&s;ed. Their disappointment at receiving my report may
<PB N="21" REF="34">
ea&s;ily be conceived; and it was &s;till increa&s;ed by an account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. November.</NOTE> that it had been re&s;olved, not only to prevent their re&s;iding on &s;hore, and going up the country, but even their leaving the &s;hip; orders having been given, that no per&s;on except the Captain, and &s;uch common &s;ailors as were required to be upon duty, &s;hould be permitted to land; and that there was probably a particular view to the pa&s;&s;engers in this pro|hibition, as they were reported to be Gentlemen &s;ent abroad to make ob&s;ervations and di&s;coveries, and were uncommonly qualified for that purpo&s;e. In the evening, however, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, and attempted to go on &s;hore, in order to make a vi&s;it to the Viceroy; but they were &s;topped by the guard-boat which had come off with our pinnace, and which kept hovering round the &s;hip all the while &s;he lay here, for that purpo&s;e; the officer on board &s;aying, that he had particular orders, which he could not di&s;obey, to &s;uffer no pa&s;&s;enger, nor any officer, except the Captain, to pa&s;s the boat. After much expo&s;tulation to no purpo&s;e, they were obliged, with whatever reluctance and mortification, to return on board. I then went on &s;hore my&s;elf, but found the Viceroy inflexible; he had one an|&s;wer ready for every thing I could &s;ay, That the re&s;trictions under which he had laid us, were in obedience to the King of Portugal's commands, and therefore indi&s;pen&s;ible.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I determined, rather than be made a pri|&s;oner in my own boat, to go on &s;hore no more; for the offi|cer who, under pretence of a compliment, attended me when I was a&s;hore, in&s;i&s;ted al&s;o upon going with me to and from the &s;hip: but &s;till imagining, that the &s;crupulous vigilance of the Viceroy mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome mi&s;taken notion about us, which might more ea&s;ily be removed by writing than in conver&s;ation, I drew up a memorial, and Mr. Banks drew up another, which we &s;ent on &s;hore. The&s;e memorials
<PB N="22" REF="35">
were both an&s;wered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. November.</NOTE> but by no means to our &s;atisfaction; we therefore replied: in con&s;equence of which, &s;everal other papers were interchanged between us and the Viceroy, but &s;till without effect. However, as I thought &s;ome degree of force, on the part of the Viceroy, to enforce the&s;e re&s;tric|tions, nece&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify my acquie&s;cence in them to the admiralty; I gave orders to my Lieutenant, Mr. Hicks, when I &s;ent him with our la&s;t reply on Sunday the 20th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 20.</NOTE> in the evening, not to &s;uffer a guard to be put into his boat. When the officer on board the guard-boat found that Mr. Hicks was determined to obey my orders, he did not pro|ceed to force, but attended him to the landing-place, and reported the matter to the Viceroy. Upon this his Excel|lency refu&s;ed to receive the memorial, and ordered Mr. Hicks to return to the &s;hip; when he came back to the boat, he found that a guard had been put on board in his ab&s;ence, but he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to return till the &s;oldier was re|moved: the officer then proceeded to enforce the Viceroy's orders; he &s;eized all the boat's crew, and &s;ent them under an armed force to pri&s;on, putting Mr. Hicks at the &s;ame time into one of their own boats, and &s;ending him under a guard back to the &s;hip. As &s;oon as he had reported the&s;e particulars, I wrote again to the Viceroy, demanding my boat and crew, and in my letter inclo&s;ed the memorial which he had refu&s;ed to receive from Mr. Hicks: the&s;e papers I &s;ent by a petty officer, that I might wave the di&s;pute about a guard, again&s;t which I had never objected except when there was a commi&s;&s;ioned officer on board the boat. The petty officer was permitted to go on &s;hore with his guard, and, having delivered his letter, was told that an an&s;wer would be &s;ent the next day.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock this evening it began to blow very hard in &s;udden gu&s;ts from the South, and our long-boat
<PB N="23" REF="36">
coming on board ju&s;t at this time with four pipes of rum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. November.</NOTE> the rope which was thrown to her from the &s;hip, and which was taken hold of by the people on board, unfortunately broke, and the boat, which had come to the &s;hip before the wind, went adrift to windward of her, with a &s;mall &s;kiff of Mr. Banks's that was fa&s;tened to her &s;tern. This was a great misfortune, as the pinnace being detained on &s;hore, we had no boat on board but a four oar'd yawl: the yawl, however, was immediately manned and &s;ent to her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; but, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t effort of the people in both boats, they were very &s;oon out of &s;ight: far indeed we could not &s;ee at that time in the evening, but the di&s;tance was enough to convince us that they were not under com|mand, which gave us great unea&s;ine&s;s, as we knew they mu&s;t drive directly upon a reef of rocks which ran out ju&s;t to leeward of where we lay: after waiting &s;ome hours in the utmo&s;t anxiety, we gave them over for lo&s;t, but about three o'clock the next morning had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee all the people come on board in the yawl. From them we learnt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 21.</NOTE> that the long-boat having filled with water, they had brought her to a grappling and left her; and that, having fallen in with the reef of rocks in their return to the &s;hip, they had been obliged to cut Mr. Banks's little boat adrift. As the lo&s;s of our long-boat, which we had now too much rea&s;on to ap|prehend, would have been an un&s;peakable di&s;advantage to us, con&s;idering the nature of our expedition, I &s;ent another let|ter to the Viceroy, as &s;oon as I thought he could be &s;een, acquainting him with our misfortune, and reque&s;ting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a boat from the &s;hore for the recovery of our own; I al&s;o renewed my demand that the pinnace and her crew &s;hould be no longer detained: after &s;ome delay, his Excellency thought &s;it to comply both with my reque&s;t and demand; and the &s;ame day we happily recovered both the
<PB N="24" REF="37">
long-boat and &s;kiff,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. November. Wedne&s;. 23.</NOTE> with the rum, but every thing el&s;e that was on board was lo&s;t. On the 23d, the Viceroy, in his an|&s;wer to my remon&s;trance again&s;t &s;eizing my men and de|taining the boat, acknowledged that I had been treated with &s;ome incivility, but &s;aid that the re&s;i&s;tance of my officers, to what he had declared to be the King's orders, made it ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; he al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts whether the Endeavour, con&s;idering her &s;tructure and other circum|&s;tances, was in the &s;ervice of his Maje&s;ty, though I had be|fore &s;hewed him my commi&s;&s;ion: to this I an&s;wered in writ|ing, That to remove all &s;cruples, I was ready to produce my commi&s;&s;ion again. His Excellency's &s;cruples however &s;till remained, and in his reply to my letter he not only expre&s;&s;ed them in &s;till plainer terms, but accu&s;ed my people of &s;mug|gling. This charge, I am confident, was without the lea&s;t foundation in truth. Mr. Banks's &s;ervants had indeed found means to go on &s;hore on the 22d at day-break, and &s;tay till it was dark in the evening, but they brought on board only plants and in&s;ects, having been &s;ent for no other purpo&s;e. And I had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe that not a &s;ingle ar|ticle was &s;muggled by any of our people who were admitted on &s;hore, though many artful means were u&s;ed to tempt them even by the very officers that were under his Excellency's roof, which made the charge &s;till more injurious and pro|voking. I have indeed &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that one poor fellow bought a &s;ingle bottle of rum with &s;ome of the clothes upon his back; and in my an&s;wer I reque&s;ted of his Excellency, that, if &s;uch an attempt at illicit trade &s;hould be repeated, he would without &s;cruple order the offender to be taken into cu&s;tody. And thus ended our altercation, both by conference and writing, with the Viceroy of Rio de Janeiro.</P>

<P>It is remarkable, that, during the la&s;t three or four days of our &s;taying in this harbour, the air was loaded with butter|flies: they were chiefly of one &s;ort, but in &s;uch numbers that thou&s;ands were in view in every direction, and the greate&s;t part of them above our ma&s;t-head.</P>
<P>We lay here from the 14th of November to the 7th of December, &s;omething more than three weeks, during which
<PB N="27" REF="40">
time Mr. Monkhou&s;e, our Surgeon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> was on &s;hore every day to buy our provi&s;ions; Dr. Solander was on &s;hore once; I was &s;everal times on &s;hore my&s;elf, and Mr. Banks al&s;o found means to get into the country, notwith&s;tanding the watch that was &s;et over us. I &s;hall, therefore, with the intelligence obtained from the&s;e Gentlemen, and my own ob&s;ervations, give &s;ome account of the town, and the country adjacent.</P>
<P>Rio de Janeiro, or the river of Januarius, was probably &s;o called from its having been di&s;covered on the fea&s;t-day of that &s;aint; and the town, which is the capital of the Portu|gue&s;e dominions in America, derives its name from the river, which indeed is rather an arm of the &s;ea, for it did not appear to receive any con&s;iderable &s;tream of fre&s;h water: it &s;tands on a plain, clo&s;e to the &s;hore, on the we&s;t &s;ide of the bay, at the foot of &s;everal high mountains which ri&s;e be|hind it. It is neither ill de&s;igned nor ill built; the hou&s;es, in general, are of &s;tone, and two &s;tories high; every hou&s;e having, after the manner of the Portugue&s;e, a little balcony before its windows, and a lattice of wood before the balcony. I computed its circuit to be about three miles; for it appears to be equal in &s;ize to the large&s;t country towns in England, Bri&s;tol and Liverpool not excepted; the &s;treets are &s;traight, and of a convenient breadth, inter&s;ecting each other at right angles; the greater part, however, lie in a line with the cita|del, called St. Seba&s;tian, which &s;tands on the top of a hill that commands the town.</P>
<P>It is &s;upplied with water from the neighbouring hills, by an aqueduct, which is rai&s;ed upon two &s;tories of arches, and is &s;aid in &s;ome places to be at a great height from the ground, from which the water is conveyed by pipes into a fountain in the great &s;quare that exactly fronts the Vice|roy's palace. At this fountain great numbers of people are
<PB N="28" REF="41">
continually waiting for their turn to draw water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> and the &s;oldiers, who are po&s;ted at the Governor's door, find it very difficult to maintain any regularity among them. The water at this fountain however is &s;o bad, that we, who had been two months at &s;ea, confined to that in our ca&s;ks, which was almo&s;t always foul, could not drink it with plea&s;ure. Water of a better quality is laid into &s;ome other part of the town, but I could not learn by what means.</P>
<P>The churches are very fine, and there is more religious parade in this place than in any of the Popi&s;h countries in Europe: there is a proce&s;&s;ion of &s;ome pari&s;h every day, with various in&s;ignia, all &s;plendid and co&s;tly in the highe&s;t de|gree: they beg money, and &s;ay prayers in great form, at the corner of every &s;treet.</P>
<P>While we lay here, one of the churches was rebuilding; and to defray the expence, the pari&s;h to which it belonged had leave to beg in proce&s;&s;ion through the whole city once a week, by which very con&s;iderable &s;ums were collected. At this ceremony, which was performed by night, all the boys of a certain age were obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t, the &s;ons of Gentlemen not being excu&s;ed. Each of the&s;e boys was dre&s;&s;ed in a black ca&s;&s;ock, with a &s;hort red cloak, hanging about as low as the wai&s;t, and carried in his hand a pole about &s;ix or &s;even feet long, at the end of which was tied a lantern: the number of lanterns was generally above two hundred, and the light they gave was &s;o great, that the people who &s;aw it from the cabbin windows thought the town had been on fire.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, however, may pay their devotions at the &s;hrine of any &s;aint in the calendar, without waiting till there is a proce&s;&s;ion; for before almo&s;t every hou&s;e there is a little cupboard, furni&s;hed with a gla&s;s window, in which one of the&s;e tutelary powers is waiting to be gracious; and to pre|vent
<PB N="29" REF="42">
his being out of mind, by being out of &s;ight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> a lamp is kept con&s;tantly burning before the window of his taber|nacle in the night. The people indeed are by no means re|mi&s;s in their devotions, for before the&s;e &s;aints they pray and &s;ing hymns with &s;uch vehemence, that in the night they were very di&s;tinctly heard on board the &s;hip, though &s;he lay at the di&s;tance of at lea&s;t half a mile from the town.</P>
<P>The government here, as to its form, is mixed; it is not|withstanding very de&s;potic in fact. It con&s;i&s;ts of the Viceroy, the Governor of the town, and a council, the number of which I could not learn: without the con&s;ent of this coun|cil, in which the Viceroy has a ca&s;ting vote, no judicial act &s;hould be performed; yet both the Viceroy and Governor frequently commit per&s;ons to pri&s;on at their own plea&s;ure, and &s;ometimes &s;end them to Li&s;bon, without acquainting their friends or family with what is laid to their charge, or where they may be found.</P>
<P>To re&s;train the people from travelling into the country, and getting into any di&s;trict where gold or diamonds may be found, of both which there is much more than the go|vernment can otherwi&s;e &s;ecure, certain bounds are pre&s;cribed them, at the di&s;cretion of the Viceroy, &s;ometimes at a few, and &s;ometimes at many miles di&s;tance from the city. On the verge of the&s;e limits a guard con&s;tantly patroles, and whoever is found beyond it, is immediately &s;eized and thrown into pri&s;on: and if a man is, upon any pretence, taken up by the guard within the limits, he will be &s;ent to pri&s;on, tho' it &s;hould appear that he did not know their extent.</P>
<P>The inhabitants, which are very numerous, con&s;i&s;t of Portugue&s;e, Negroes, and Indians, the original natives of the country. The town&s;hip of Rio, which, as I was told, is but a &s;mall part of the Capitanea, or province, is &s;aid to contain
<PB N="30" REF="43">
37,000 White per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> and 629,000 Blacks, many of whom are free; making together 666,000, in the proportion of &s;eventeen to one. The Indians, who are employed to do the King's work in this neighbourhood, can &s;carcely be con&s;i|dered as inhabitants; their re&s;idence is at a di&s;tance, from whence they come by turns to their ta&s;k, which they are obliged to perform for a &s;mall pay. The guard-boat was con&s;tantly rowed by the&s;e people, who are of a light copper colour, and have long black hair.</P>
<P>The military e&s;tabli&s;hment here con&s;i&s;ts of twelve regi|ments of regular troops, &s;ix of which are Portugue&s;e and &s;ix Creoles; and twelve other regiments of provincial militia. To the regulars the inhabitants behave with the utmo&s;t hu|mility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and I was told, that if any of them &s;hould neglect to take off his hat upon meeting an officer, he would immediately be knocked down. The&s;e haughty &s;everities render the people extremely civil to any &s;tranger who has the appearance of a Gentleman. But the &s;ubordi|nation of the officers them&s;elves to the Viceroy is enforced with circum&s;tances equally mortifying, for they are obliged to attend in his hall three times every day to a&s;k his com|mands: the an&s;wer con&s;tantly is, "There is nothing new." I have been told, that this &s;ervile attendance is exacted to pre|vent their going into the country; and if &s;o, it effectually an&s;wers the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is, I believe, univer&s;ally allowed, that the women, both of the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements in South Ame|rica, make le&s;s difficulty of granting per&s;onal favours, than tho&s;e of any other civilized country in the world. Of the Ladies of this town &s;ome have formed &s;o unfavourable an opinion as to declare, that they did not believe there was a mode&s;t one among them. This cen&s;ure is certainly too ge|neral;
<PB N="31" REF="44">
but what Dr. Solander &s;aw of them when he was on &s;hore, gave him no very exalted idea of their cha&s;tity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> he told me, that as &s;oon as it was dark, one or more of them appeared in every window, and di&s;tingui&s;hed tho&s;e whom they liked, among the Gentlemen that walked pa&s;t them, by giving them no&s;egays; that he, and two Gentlemen who were with him, received &s;o many of the&s;e favours, that, at the end of their walk, which was not a long one, they threw whole hatfuls of them away. Great allowance mu&s;t cer|tainly be made for local cu&s;toms; that which in one coun|try would be an indecent familiarity, is a mere act of gene|ral courte&s;y in another; of the fact, therefore, which I have related, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, but that I am confident it is true.</P>
<P>Neither will I take upon me to affirm, that murders are frequently committed here; but the churches afford an a&s;y|lum to the criminal: and as our cock&s;wain was one day looking at two men, who appeared to be talking together in a friendly manner, one of them &s;uddenly drew a knife and &s;tabbed the other; who not in&s;tantly falling, the murderer withdrew the weapon, and &s;tabbed him a &s;econd time. He then ran away, and was pur&s;ued by &s;ome Negroes who were al&s;o witne&s;&s;es of the fact; but whether he e&s;caped or was taken I never heard.</P>
<P>The country, at a &s;mall di&s;tance round the town, which is all that any of us &s;aw, is beautiful in the highe&s;t degree; the wilde&s;t &s;pots being varied with a greater luxuriance of flowers, both as to number and beauty, than the be&s;t gardens in England.</P>
<P>Upon the trees and bu&s;hes &s;at an almo&s;t endle&s;s variety of birds, e&s;pecially &s;mall ones, many of them covered with the mo&s;t elegant plumage; among which were the humming|bird.
<PB N="32" REF="45">
Of in&s;ects too there was a great variety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> and &s;ome of them very beautiful; but they were much more nimble than tho&s;e of Europe, e&s;pecially the butterflies, mo&s;t of which flew near the tops of the trees, and were therefore very difficult to be caught, except when the &s;ea breeze blew fre&s;h, which kept them nearer to the ground.</P>
<P>The banks of the &s;ea, and of the &s;mall brooks which water this part of the country, are almo&s;t covered with the &s;mall crabs called <HI>Cancer vocans</HI>; &s;ome of the&s;e had one of the claws, called by naturali&s;ts the hand, very large; others had them both remarkably &s;mall, and of equal &s;ize, a difference which is &s;aid to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;exes, that with the large claw being the male.</P>
<P>There is the appearance of but little cultivation; the greater part of the land is wholly uncultivated, and very little care and labour &s;eem to have been be&s;towed upon the re&s;t; there are indeed little patches or gardens, in which many kinds of European garden &s;tuff are produced, particu|larly cabbages, peas, beans, kidney-beans, turnips, and white radi&s;hes, but all much inferior to our own: water melons and pine apples are al&s;o produced in the&s;e &s;pots, and they are the only fruits that we &s;aw cultivated, though the coun|try produces mu&s;k melons, oranges, limes, lemons, &s;weet lemons, citrons, plantains, bananas, mangos, mamane ap|ples, acajou or ca&s;hou apples and nuts; jamboira of two kinds, one of which bears a &s;mall black fruit; cocoa nuts, mangos, palm nuts of two kinds, one long, the other round; and palm berries, all which were in &s;ea&s;on while we were there.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e fruits the water melons and oranges are the be&s;t in their kind; the pine apples are much inferior to tho&s;e that I have eaten in England; they are indeed more juicy
<PB N="33" REF="46">
and &s;weet, but have no flavour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> I believe them to be natives of this country, though we heard of none that at this time grow wild; they have, however, very little care be&s;towed upon them, the plants being &s;et between beds of any kind of garden-&s;tuff, and &s;uffered to take the chance of the &s;ea&s;on. The melons are &s;till wor&s;e, at lea&s;t tho&s;e that we ta&s;ted, which were mealy and in&s;ipid; but the water melons are excellent; they have a flavour, at lea&s;t a degree of acidity, which ours have not. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;everal &s;pecies of the prickle pear, and &s;ome European fruits, particularly the apple and peach, both which were very mealy and in&s;ipid. In the&s;e gardens al&s;o grow yams, and mandihoca, which in the We&s;t Indies is called Ca&s;&s;ada or Ca&s;&s;ava, and to the flour of which the people here, as I have before ob&s;erved, give the name of <HI>Farinha de Pao,</HI> which may not improperly be tran&s;lated, Powder of po&s;t. The &s;oil, though it produces tobacco and &s;ugar, will not produce bread-corn; &s;o that the people here have no wheat-flour, but what is brought from Portugal, and &s;old at the rate of a &s;hilling a pound, though it is generally &s;poiled by being heated in its pa&s;&s;age. Mr. Banks is of opinion, that all the products of our We&s;t Indian i&s;lands would grow here; notwith&s;tanding which, the inha|bitants import their coffee and chocolate from Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the land, as far as we &s;aw of the country, is laid down in gra&s;s, upon which cattle are pa&s;tured in great plenty; but they are &s;o lean, that an Engli&s;hman will &s;carcely eat of their fle&s;h: the herbage of the&s;e pa&s;tures con&s;i&s;ts prin|cipally of cre&s;&s;es, and con&s;equently is &s;o &s;hort, that though it may afford a bite for hor&s;es and &s;heep, it can &s;carcely be grazed by horned cattle in a &s;ufficient quantity to keep them alive.</P>
<P>This country may po&s;&s;ibly produce many valuable drugs; but we could not find any in the apothecaries &s;hops, except
<PB N="34" REF="47">
pareira brava,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> and bal&s;am capivi; both of which were ex|cellent in their kind, and &s;old at a very low price. The drug trade is probably carried on to the northward, as well as that of the dying woods, for we could get no intelligence of either of them here.</P>
<P>As to manufactures, we neither &s;aw nor heard of any, ex|cept that of cotton hammocks, in which people are carried about here, as they are with us in &s;edan chairs; and the&s;e are principally, if not wholly, fabricated by the Indians.</P>
<P>The riches of the place con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the mines, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to lie far up the country, though we could never learn where, or at what di&s;tance; for the &s;ituation is concealed as much as po&s;&s;ible, and troops are continually employed in guarding the roads that lead to them: it is al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for any man to get a &s;ight of them, except tho&s;e who are employed there; and indeed the &s;tronge&s;t cu|rio&s;ity would &s;carcely induce any man to attempt it, for whoever is found upon the road to them, if he cannot give undeniable evidence of his having bu&s;ine&s;s there, is imme|diately hanged up upon the next tree.</P>
<P>Much gold is certainly brought from the&s;e mines, but at an expence of life, that mu&s;t &s;trike every man, to whom cu&s;tom has not made it familiar, with horror. No le&s;s than forty thou&s;and negroes are annually imported, on the king's ac|count, to dig the mines; and we were credibly informed, that, the la&s;t year but one before we arrived here, this num|ber fell &s;o &s;hort, probably from &s;ome epidemic di&s;ea&s;e, that twenty thou&s;and more were draughted from the town of Rio.</P>
<P>Precious &s;tones are al&s;o found here in &s;uch plenty, that a certain quantity only is allowed to be collected in a year; to collect this quantity, a number of people are &s;ent into the
<PB N="35" REF="48">
country where they are found, and when it is got together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> which &s;ometimes happens in a month, &s;ometimes in le&s;s and &s;ometimes in more, they return; and after that, whoever is found in the&s;e precious di&s;tricts, on any pretence, before the next year, is immediately put to death.</P>
<P>The jewels found here, are diamonds, topazes of &s;everal kinds, and amethy&s;ts. We did not &s;ee any of the diamonds, but were informed that the Viceroy had a large quantity by him, which he would &s;ell on the King of Portugal's account, but not at a le&s;s price than they are &s;old for in Europe. Mr. Banks bought a few topazes and amethy&s;ts as &s;pecimens: of the topazes there are three &s;orts, of very different value, which are di&s;tingui&s;hed here by the names of Pinga d'agua qualidade primeiro, Pinga d'agua qualidade &s;ecundo, and Chry&s;tallos armerillos: they are &s;old, large and &s;mall, good and bad together, by octavos, or the eighth part of an ounce; the be&s;t at 4s. 9d. All dealing, however, in the&s;e &s;tones is prohibited to the &s;ubject, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties: there were jewellers here formerly, who purcha&s;ed and worked them on their own account; but about fourteen months be|fore our arrival, orders came from the court of Portugal, that no more &s;tones &s;hould be wrought here, except on the King's account: the jewellers were ordered to bring all their tools to the Viceroy, and left without any means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence. The per&s;ons employed here to work &s;tones for the King are &s;laves.</P>
<P>The coin that is current here, is either that of Portugal, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of thirty-&s;ix &s;hillings pieces; or pieces, both of gold and &s;ilver, which are &s;truck at this place: the pieces of &s;ilver, which are very much deba&s;ed, are called Petacks, and are of different value, and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed by the number of rees that is marked on the out&s;ide. Here is al&s;o
<PB N="36" REF="49">
a copper coin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> like that in Portugal, of five and ten ree pieces. A ree is a nominal coin of Portugal, ten of which are equal in value to about three farthings &s;terling.</P>
<P>The harbour of Rio de Janeiro is &s;ituated W. by N. 18 leagues from Cape Trio, and may be known by a remark|able hill, in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf, at the we&s;t point of the bay; but as all the coa&s;t is very high, and ri&s;es in many peaks, the entrance of this harbour may be more certainly di&s;tingui&s;hed by the i&s;lands that lie before it; one of which, called Rodonda, is high and round like a hay-&s;tack, and lies at the di&s;tance of two leagues and an half from the entrance of the bay, in the direction of S. by W.; but the fir&s;t i&s;lands which are met with, coming from the ea&s;t, or Cape Trio, are two that have a rocky appearance, lying near to each other, and at the di&s;tance of about four miles from the &s;hore: there are al&s;o at the di&s;tance of three leagues to the we&s;tward of the&s;e, two other i&s;lands which lie near to each other, a little without the bay on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and very near the &s;hore. This harbour is certainly a good one; the entrance indeed is not wide, but the &s;ea breeze, which blows every day from ten or twelve o'clock till &s;un&s;et, makes it ea&s;y for any &s;hip to go in before the wind; and it grows wider as the town is approached, &s;o that abrea&s;t of it there is room for the large&s;t fleet, in five or &s;ix fathom water, with an oozy bottom. At the narrow part, the entrance is defended by two forts. The principal is Santa Cruz, which &s;tands on the ea&s;t point of the bay, and has been mentioned before; that on the we&s;t &s;ide is called fort Lozia, and is built upon a rock that lies clo&s;e to the main; the di&s;tance between them is about &frac34; of a mile, but the channel is not quite &s;o broad, be|cau&s;e there are &s;unken rocks which lie off each fort, and in this part alone there is danger: the narrowne&s;s of the chan|nel cau&s;es the tides, both flood and ebb, to run with con&s;i|derable
<PB N="37" REF="50">
&s;trength,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> &s;o that they cannot be &s;temmed without a fre&s;h breeze. The rockyne&s;s of the bottom makes it al&s;o un&s;afe to anchor here; but all danger may be avoided by keeping in the middle of the channel. Within the entrance, the cour&s;e up the bay is fir&s;t N. by W. &frac12; W. and. N.N.W. &s;omething more than a league; this will bring the ve&s;&s;el the length of the great road; and N.W. and W.N.W. one league more will carry her to the I&s;le dos Cobras, which lies before the city: &s;he &s;hould then keep the north &s;ide of this i&s;land clo&s;e on board, and anchor above it, before a mona&s;tery of Benedictines which &s;tands upon a hill at the N.W. end of the city.</P>
<P>The river, and indeed the whole coa&s;t, abounds with a greater variety of fi&s;h than we had ever &s;een; a day &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed in which one or more of a new &s;pecies were not brought to Mr. Banks: the bay al&s;o is as well adapted for catching the&s;e fi&s;h as can be conceived; for it is full of &s;mall i&s;lands, between which there is &s;hallow water, and proper beaches for drawing the &s;eine. The &s;ea, without the bay, abounds with dolphins, and large mackrel of different kinds, which readily bite at a hook, and the inhabitants always tow one after their boats for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Though the climate is hot, the &s;ituation of this place is certainly whole&s;ome; while we &s;tayed here the thermometer never ro&s;e higher than 83, though we had frequent rains, and once a very hard gale of wind.</P>
<P>Ships water here at the fountain in the great &s;quare, though, as I have ob&s;erved, the water is not good; they land their ca&s;ks upon a &s;mooth &s;andy beach, which is not more than a hundred yards di&s;tant from the fountain, and upon applica|tion to the Viceroy, a centinel will be appointed to look after
<PB N="38" REF="51">
them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December.</NOTE> and clear the way to the fountain where they are to be filled.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, Rio de Janeiro is a very good place for &s;hips to put in at that want refre&s;hment: the harbour is &s;afe and commodious; and provi&s;ions, except wheaten bread and flour, may be ea&s;ily procured: as a &s;uccedaneum for bread, there are yams and ca&s;&s;ada in plenty; beef, both fre&s;h and jerked, may be bought at about two pence farthing a pound; though, as I have before remarked, it is very lean. The people here jerk their beef by taking out the bones, cutting it into large but thin &s;lices, then curing it with &s;alt, and drying it in the &s;hade: it eats very well, and, if kept dry, will re|main good a long time at &s;ea. Mutton is &s;carcely to be procured, and hogs and poultry are dear; of garden-&s;tuff and fruit there is abundance, of which, however, none can be pre&s;erved at &s;ea but the pumpkin; rum, &s;ugar, and mo|la&s;&s;es, all excellent in their kind, may be had at a rea&s;onable price; tobacco al&s;o is cheap, but it is not good. Here is a yard for building &s;hipping, and a &s;mall hulk to heave down by; for, as the tide never ri&s;es above &s;ix or &s;even foot, there is no other way of coming at a &s;hip's bottom.</P>
<P>When the boat which had been &s;ent on &s;hore returned, we hoi&s;ted her on board, and &s;tood out to &s;ea.</P>

<P>ON the 9th of December,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. December. Friday 9.</NOTE> we ob&s;erved the &s;ea to be co|vered with broad &s;treaks of a yellowi&s;h colour, &s;everal, of them a mile long, and three or four hundred yards wide: &s;ome of the water thus coloured was taken up, and found to be full of innumerable atoms pointed at the end, of a yel|lowi&s;h colour, and none more than a quarter of a line, or the fortieth part of an inch long: in the micro&s;cope they ap|peared to be <HI>Fa&s;ciculi</HI> of &s;mall fibres interwoven with each other, not unlike the nidus of &s;ome of the <HI>Phyganeas,</HI> called Caddices; but whether they were animal or vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances, whence they came, or for what they were de&s;igned, neither Mr. Banks nor Dr. Solander could gue&s;s. The &s;ame appearance had been ob&s;erved before, when we fir&s;t di&s;co|vered the continent of South America.</P>
<P>On the 11th we hooked a &s;hark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 11.</NOTE> and while we were play|ing it under the cabbin window, it threw out, and drew in again &s;everal times what appeared to be its &s;tomach: it proved to be a female, and upon being opened &s;ix young ones were taken out of it; five of them were alive and &s;wam bri&s;kly in a tub of water, but the &s;ixth appeared to have been dead &s;ome time.</P>
<P>Nothing remarkable happened till the 30th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 30.</NOTE> except that we prepared for the bad weather, which we were &s;hortly to expect, by bending a new &s;uit of &s;ails; but on this day we
<PB N="40" REF="54">
ran a cour&s;e of one hundred and &s;ixty miles by the log,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768.

We judged our|&s;elves to be now nearly oppo&s;ite to <HI>Baye &s;ans fond,</HI> where Mr. Dalrymple &s;uppo&s;es there is a pa&s;&s;age quite through the continent of America; and we thought from the in&s;ects that there might be at lea&s;t a very large river, and that it had overflowed its banks.</P>

<P>The people now beginning to complain of cold, each of them received what is called a Magellanic jacket, and a pair of trow&s;ers. The jacket is made of a thick woollen-&s;tuff, called <HI>Fearnought,</HI> which is provided by the government. We &s;aw, from time to time, a great number of penguins, alba|tro&s;&s;es, and &s;heer waters, &s;eals, whales, and porpoi&s;es: and on the 11th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 11.</NOTE> having pa&s;&s;ed Falkland's i&s;lands, we di&s;covered the coa&s;t of Terra del Fuego, at the di&s;tance of about four leagues, extending from the W. to S.

two or three leagues, we perceived &s;moke in &s;everal places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> which was made by the natives, probably as a &s;ignal, for they did not continue it after we had pa&s;&s;ed by. This day we di&s;covered that the &s;hip had got near a degree of longi|tude to the we&s;tward of the log, which, in this latitude, is 35 minutes of a degree on the equator: probably there is a &s;mall current &s;etting to the we&s;tward, which may be cau&s;ed by the we&s;terly current coming round Cape Horn, and through the Streight of Le Maire, and the indraught of the Streight of Magellan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The celebrated navigator who di&s;covered this Streight was a native of Portugal, and his name, in the language of his country, was <HI>Fernando de Magalhaens</HI>; the Spa|niards call him <HI>Hernando Magalhanes,</HI> and the French <HI>Magellan,</HI> which is the ortho|graphy that has been generally adopted: a Gentleman, the fifth in de&s;cent from this great adventurer, is now living in or near London, and communicated the true name of his ance&s;tor to Mr. Banks, with a reque&s;t that it might be in&s;erted in this work.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having continued to range the coa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 14. Enter the Streight of Le Maire.</NOTE> on the 14th we en|tered the Streight of Le Maire; but the tide turning again&s;t us, drove us out with great violence, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;ea off Cape St. Diego, that the waves had exactly the &s;ame ap|pearance as they would have had if they had broke over a ledge of rocks; and when the &s;hip was in this torrent, &s;he frequently pitched, &s;o that the bow&s;prit was under water. About noon, we got under the land between Cape St. Diego and Cape St. Vincent, where I intended to have anchored; but finding the ground every where hard and rocky, and &s;hallowing from thirty to twelve fathoms, I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter to examine a little cove which lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance to the ea&s;tward of Cape St. Vincent. When he returned, he reported, that there was anchorage in four fathom, and a good bot|tom, clo&s;e to the ea&s;tward of the fir&s;t bluff point, on the ea&s;t of Cape St. Vincent, at the very entrance of the cove, to which I gave the name of VINCENT's Bay: before this an|choring

Saturday 14.</NOTE> however, lay &s;everal rocky ledges, that were covered with &s;ea-weed; but I was told that there was not le&s;s than eight and nine fathom over all of them. It will probably be thought &s;trange, that where weeds, which grow at the bottom, appear above the &s;urface, there &s;hould be this depth of water; but the weeds which grow upon rocky ground in the&s;e countries, and which always di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from &s;and and ooze, are of an enormous &s;ize. The leaves are four foot long, and &s;ome of the &s;talks, though not thicker than a man's thumb, above one hundred and twenty: Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander examined &s;ome of them, over which we founded and had fourteen fathom, which is eighty-four feet; and, as they made a very acute angle with the bottom, they were thought to be at lea&s;t one half longer: the foot &s;talks were &s;welled into an air ve&s;&s;el, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander called this plant <HI>Fucus giganteus.</HI> Upon the report of the Ma&s;ter, I &s;tood in with the &s;hip; but not tru&s;t|ing implicitly to his intelligence, I continued to &s;ound, and found but four fathom upon the fir&s;t ledge that I went over; concluding, therefore, that I could not anchor here without ri&s;k, I determined to &s;eek &s;ome port in the Streight, where I might get on board &s;uch wood and water as we wanted.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, however, being very de&s;irous to go on &s;hore, I &s;ent a boat with them and their people, while I kept plying as near as po&s;&s;ible with the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Having been on &s;hore four hours, they returned about nine in the evening, with above an hundred different plants and flowers, all of them wholly unknown to the botani&s;ts of Europe. They found the country about the bay to be in general &s;lat, the bottom of it in particular was a plain, co|vered with gra&s;s, which might ea&s;ily have been made into a large quantity of hay; they found al&s;o abundance of good
<PB N="43" REF="57">
wood and water, and fowl in great plenty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Saturday 14.</NOTE> Among other things, of which Nature has been liberal in this place, is Winter's bark, <HI>Winteranea aromatica</HI>; which may ea&s;ily be known by its broad leaf, &s;haped like the laurel, of a light green colour without, and inclining to blue within: the bark is ea&s;ily &s;tripped with a bone or a &s;tick, and its virtues are well known: it may be u&s;ed for culinary purpo&s;es as a &s;pice, and is not le&s;s plea&s;ant than whole&s;ome: here is al&s;o plenty of wild celery and &s;curvy gra&s;s. The trees are chiefly of one kind, a &s;pecies of the birch, called <HI>Betula antartica</HI>; the &s;tem is from thirty to forty feet long, and from two to three feet in diameter, &s;o that in a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity they might po&s;&s;ibly &s;upply a &s;hip with top-ma&s;ts: they are a light white wood, bear a &s;mall leaf, and cleave very &s;traight. Cranberries were al&s;o found here in great plenty, both white and red.</P>
<P>The per&s;ons who landed &s;aw none of the inhabitants, but fell in with two of their de&s;erted huts, one in a thick wood, and the other clo&s;e by the beach.</P>
<P>Having taken the boat on board, I made &s;ail into the Streight, and at three in the morning of the 15th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 15.</NOTE> I anchored in twelve fathom and an half, upon coral rocks, before a &s;mall cove, which we took for Port Maurice, at the di&s;tance of about half a mile from the &s;hore. Two of the natives came down to the beach, expecting us to land; but this &s;pot afforded &s;o little &s;helter, that I at length determined not to examine it: I therefore got under &s;ail again about ten o'clock, and the &s;avages retired into the woods.</P>
<P>At two o'clock, we anchored in the bay of Good Succe&s;s; and after dinner I went on &s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, to look for a watering-place, and &s;peak to the Indians, &s;everal of whom had come in &s;ight. We landed on the &s;tarboard &s;ide of the bay near &s;ome rocks, which
<PB N="44" REF="58">
made &s;mooth water and good landing;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> thirty or forty of the Indians &s;oon made their appearance at the end of a &s;andy beach on the other &s;ide of the bay, but &s;eeing our number, which was ten or twelve, they retreated. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander then advanced about one hundred yards before us, upon which two of the Indians returned, and, having advanced &s;ome paces towards them, &s;at down; as &s;oon as they came up, the Indians ro&s;e, and each of them having a &s;mall &s;tick in his hand threw it away, in a direction both from them&s;elves and the &s;trangers, which was con&s;idered as the renunciation of weapons in token of peace: they then walked bri&s;kly towards their companions, who had halted at about fifty yards behind them, and beckoned the Gentle men to follow, which they did. They were received with many uncouth &s;igns of friendship; and, in return, they di&s;|tributed among them &s;ome beads and ribbons, which had been brought on &s;hore for that purpo&s;e, and with which they were greatly delighted. A mutual confidence and good-will being thus produced, our parties joined; the conver&s;ation, &s;uch as it was, became general; and three of them accom|panied us back to the &s;hip. When they came on board, one of them, whom we took to be a prie&s;t, performed much the &s;ame ceremonies which M. Bougainville de&s;cribes, and &s;up|po&s;es to be an exorci&s;m. When he was introduced into a new part of the &s;hip, or when any thing that he had not &s;een before caught his attention, he &s;houted with all his force for &s;ome minutes, without directing his voice either to us or his companions.</P>
<P>They eat &s;ome bread and &s;ome beef, but not apparently with much plea&s;ure, though &s;uch part of what was given them as they did not eat they took away with them; but they would not &s;wallow a drop either of wine or &s;pirits: they put the gla&s;s to their lips, but, having ta&s;ted the liquor,
<PB N="45" REF="59">
they returned it, with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;gu&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> Curio&s;ity &s;eems to be one of the few pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;tingui&s;h men from brutes; and of this our gue&s;ts appeared to have very little. They went from one part of the &s;hip to another, and looked at the va&s;t variety of new objects that every moment pre|&s;ented them&s;elves, without any expre&s;&s;ion either of wonder or plea&s;ure, for the vociferation of our exorci&s;t &s;eemed to be neither.</P>
<P>After having been on board about two hours, they ex|pre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to go a&s;hore. A boat was immediately or|dered, and Mr. Banks thought fit to accompany them: he landed them in &s;afety, and conducted them to their compa|nions, among whom he remarked the &s;ame vacant indiffe|rence, as in tho&s;e who had been on board; for as on one &s;ide there appeared no eagerne&s;s to relate, &s;o on the other there &s;eemed to be no curio&s;ity to hear, how they had been received, or what they had &s;een. In about half an hour, Mr. Banks returned to the &s;hip, and the Indians retired from the &s;hore.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> An Account of what happened in a&s;cending a Mountain to &s;earch for Plants.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Monday 16.</NOTE>ON the 16th, early in the morning, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with their attendants and &s;ervants, and two &s;eamen to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying the baggage, accompanied by Mr. Monkhou&s;e the Surgeon, and Mr. Green the A&s;tronomer, &s;et out from the &s;hip, with a view to penetrate as far as they could into the country, and return at night. The hills, when viewed at a di&s;tance, &s;eemed to be partly a wood, partly a plain, and above them a bare rock. Mr. Banks hoped to get through the wood, and made no doubt, but that, beyond it, he &s;hould, in a country which no botani&s;t had ever yet vi|&s;ited, find alpine plants which would abundantly compen|&s;ate his labour. They entered the wood at a &s;mall &s;andy beach, a little to the we&s;tward of the watering-place, and continued to a&s;cend the hill, through the pathle&s;s wilder|ne&s;s, till three o'clock, before they got a near view of the places which they intended to vi&s;it. Soon after they reached what they had taken for a plain; but, to their great di&s;ap|pointment, found it a &s;wamp, covered with low bu&s;hes of birch, about three feet high, interwoven with each other, and &s;o &s;tubborn that they could not be bent out of the way; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary to lift the leg over them, which at every &s;tep was buried, ancle deep, in the &s;oil. To aggra|vate the pain and difficulty of &s;uch travelling, the weather, which hitherto had been very fine, much like one of our bright days in May, became gloomy and cold; with &s;udden
<PB N="47" REF="61">
bla&s;ts of a mo&s;t piercing wind, accompanied with &s;now.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Monday 16.</NOTE> They pu&s;hed forward, however, in good &s;pirits, notwith|&s;tanding their fatigue, hoping the wor&s;t of the way was pa&s;t, and that the bare rock which they had &s;een from the tops of the lower hills was not more than a mile before them; but when they had got about two thirds over this woody &s;wamp, Mr. Buchan, one of Mr. Banks's draughtmen, was unhappily &s;eized with a fit. This made it nece&s;&s;ary for the whole company to halt, and as it was impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould go any farther, a fire was kindled, and tho&s;e who were mo&s;t fatigued were left behind to take care of him. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Green, and Mr. Monkhou&s;e went on, and in a &s;hort time reached the &s;ummit. As botani&s;ts, their expectations were here abundantly gratified; for they found a great variety of plants, which, with re&s;pect to the alpine plants in Europe, are exactly what tho&s;e plants are with re|&s;pect to &s;uch as grow in the plain.</P>
<P>The cold was now become more &s;evere, and the &s;now-bla&s;ts more frequent; the day al&s;o was &s;o far &s;pent, that it was found impo&s;&s;ible to get back to the &s;hip before the next morning: to pa&s;s the night upon &s;uch a mountain, in &s;uch a climate, was not only comfortle&s;s, but dreadful; it was impo&s;&s;ible however to be avoided, and they were to provide for it as well as they could.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, while they were improving an opportunity which they had, with &s;o much danger and difficulty, procured, by gathering the plants which they found upon the mountain, &s;ent Mr. Green and Mr. Monk|hou&s;e back to Mr. Buchan and the people that were with him, with directions to bring them to a hill, which they thought lay in a better rout for returning to the wood, and which was therefore appointed as a general rendezvous. It
<PB N="48" REF="62">
was propo&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Monday 16.</NOTE> that from this hill they &s;hould pu&s;h through the &s;wamp, which &s;eemed by the new rout not to be more than half a mile over, into the &s;helter of the wood, and there build their wigwam, and make a fire: this, as their way was all down hill, it &s;eemed ea&s;y to accompli&s;h. Their whole company a&s;&s;embled at the rendezvous, and, though pinched with the cold, were in health and &s;pirks, Mr. Buchan him&s;elf having recovered his &s;trength in a much greater degree than could have been expected. It was now near eight o'clock in the evening, but &s;till good day-light, and they &s;et forward for the neare&s;t valley, Mr. Banks him|&s;elf undertaking to bring up the rear, and &s;ee that no &s;trag|gler was left behind: this may perhaps be thought a &s;uper|fluous caution, but it will &s;oon appear to be otherwi&s;e. Dr. Solander, who had more than once cro&s;&s;ed the mountains which divide Sweden from Norway, well knew that extreme cold, e&s;pecially when joined with fatigue, produces a torpor and &s;leepine&s;s that are almo&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible: he therefore con|jured the company to keep moving, whatever pain it might co&s;t them, and whatever relief they might be promi&s;ed by an inclination to re&s;t: Whoever &s;its down, &s;ays he, will &s;leep; and whoever &s;leeps, will wake no more. Thus, at once ad|moni&s;hed and alarmed, they &s;et forward; but while they were &s;till upon the naked rock, and before they had got among the bu&s;hes, the cold became &s;uddenly &s;o inten&s;e, as to produce the effects that had been mo&s;t dreaded. Dr. Solander him&s;elf was the fir&s;t who found the inclination, again&s;t which he had warned others, irre&s;i&s;tible; and in&s;i&s;ted upon being &s;uf|fered to lie down. Mr. Banks intreated and remon&s;trated in vain, down he lay upon the ground, though it was covered with &s;now; and it was with great difficulty that his friend kept him from &s;leeping. Richmond al&s;o, one of the black
<PB N="49" REF="63">
&s;ervants, began to linger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Monday 16.</NOTE> having &s;uffered from the cold in the &s;ame manner as the Doctor. Mr. Banks, therefore, &s;ent five of the company, among whom was Mr. Buchan, forward to get a fire ready at the fir&s;t convenient place they could find; and him&s;elf, with four others, remained with the Doctor and Richmond, whom partly by per&s;ua&s;ion and entreaty, and partly by force, they brought on; but when they had got through the greate&s;t part of the birch and &s;wamp, they both declared they could go no farther. Mr. Banks had recour&s;e again to entreaty and expo&s;tulation, but they produced no effect: when Richmond was told, that if he did not go on he would in a &s;hort time be frozen to death; he an&s;wered, That he de&s;ired nothing but to lie down and die: the Doctor did not &s;o explicitly renounce his life; he &s;aid he was willing to go on, but that he mu&s;t fir&s;t take &s;ome &s;leep, though he had before told the company that to &s;leep was to peri&s;h. Mr. Banks and the re&s;t found it impo&s;&s;ible to carry them, and there being no remedy they were both &s;uffered to &s;it down, being partly &s;upported by the bu&s;hes, and in a few minutes they fell into a profound &s;leep: &s;oon after, &s;ome of the people who had been &s;ent forward returned, with the welcome news that a fire was kindled about a quarter of a mile farther on the way. Mr. Banks then endeavoured to wake Dr. Solander and happily &s;ucceeded: but, though he had not &s;lept five minutes, he had almo&s;t lo&s;t the u&s;e of his limbs, and the mu&s;cles were &s;o &s;hrunk that his &s;hoes fell from his feet; he con&s;ented to go forward with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as could be given him, but no attempts to relieve poor Richmond were &s;ucce&s;sful. It being found impo&s;&s;ible to make him &s;tir, after &s;ome time had been lo&s;t in the attempt, Mr. Banks left his other black &s;ervant and a &s;eaman, who &s;eemed to have &s;uf|fered lea&s;t by the cold, to look after him; promi&s;ing, that as &s;oon as two others &s;hould be &s;ufficiently warmed, they &s;hould
<PB N="50" REF="64">
be relieved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Monday 16.</NOTE> Mr. Banks, with much difficulty, at length got the Doctor to the fire; and &s;oon after &s;ent two of the people who had been refre&s;hed, in hopes that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e who had been left behind, they would be able to bring Richmond, even though it &s;hould &s;till be found impo&s;&s;ible to wake him. In about half an hour, however, they had the mortification to &s;ee the&s;e two men return alone; they &s;aid, that they had been all round the place to which they had been directed, but could neither find Richmond nor tho&s;e who had been left with him; and that though they had &s;houted many times, no voice had replied. This was mat|ter of equal &s;urpri&s;e and concern, particularly to Mr. Banks, who, while he was wondering how it could happen, mi&s;&s;ed a bottle of rum, the company's whole &s;tock, which they now concluded to be in the knap&s;ack of one of the ab&s;entees. It was conjectured, that with this Richmond had been rouzed by the two per&s;ons who had been left with him, and that, having perhaps drank too freely of it them&s;elves, they had all rambled from the place where they had been left, in &s;earch of the fire, in&s;tead of waiting for tho&s;e who &s;hould have been their a&s;&s;i&s;tants and guides. Another fall of &s;now now came on, and continued ince&s;&s;antly for two hours, &s;o that all hope of &s;eeing them again, at lea&s;t alive, were given up; but about twelve o'clock, to the great joy of tho&s;e at the fire, a &s;houting was heard at &s;ome di&s;tance. Mr. Banks, with four more, immediately went out, and found the &s;eaman with ju&s;t &s;trength enough left to &s;tagger along, and call out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Mr. Banks &s;ent him immediately to the fire, and, by his direction, proceeded in &s;earch of the other two, whom he &s;oon after found. Richmond was upon his legs, but not able to put one before the other; his companion was lying upon the ground, as in&s;en&s;ible as a &s;tone. All hands
<PB N="51" REF="65">
were now called from the fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Monday 16.</NOTE> and an attempt was made to carry them to it; but this, notwith&s;tanding the united ef|forts of the whole company, was found to be impo&s;&s;ible. The night was extremely dark, the &s;now was now very deep, and, under the&s;e additional di&s;advantages, they found it very difficult to make way through the bu&s;hes and the bog for them&s;elves, all of them getting many falls in the attempt. The only alternative was to make a fire upon the &s;pot; but the &s;now which had fallen, and was &s;till falling, be&s;ides what was every moment &s;haken in flakes from the trees, rendered it equally impracticable, to kindle one there, and to bring any part of that which had been kindled in the wood thither: they were, therefore, reduced to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the unhappy wretches to their fate; having fir&s;t made them a bed of boughs from the trees, and &s;pread a covering of the &s;ame kind over them to a con&s;iderable height.</P>
<P>Having now been expo&s;ed to the cold and the &s;now near an hour and an half, &s;ome of the re&s;t began to lo&s;e their &s;en|&s;ibility; and one Bri&s;coe, another of Mr. Banks's &s;ervants, was &s;o ill, that it was thought he mu&s;t die before he could be got to the fire.</P>
<P>At the fire, however, at length they arrived; and pa&s;&s;ed the night in a &s;ituation, which, however dreadful in it&s;elf, was rendered more afflicting by the remembrance of what was pa&s;t, and the uncertainty of what was to come. Of twelve, the number that &s;et out together in health and &s;pirits, two were &s;uppo&s;ed to be already dead; a third was &s;o ill, that it was very doubtful whether he would be able to go forward in the morning; and a fourth, Mr. Bunchan, was in danger of a return of his fits, by fre&s;h fatigue after &s;o uncomfort|able a night: they were di&s;tant from the &s;hip a long day's
<PB N="52" REF="66">
journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Monday 16.</NOTE> through pathle&s;s woods, in which it was too pro|bable they might be bewildered till they were overtaken by the next night; and, not having prepared for a journey of more than eight or ten hours, they were wholly de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, except a vulture, which they happened to &s;hoot while they were out, and which, if equally divided, would not afford each of them half a meal; and they knew not how much more they might &s;uffer from the cold, as the &s;now &s;till continued to fall. A dreadful te&s;timony of the &s;e|verity of the climate, as it was now the mid&s;t of &s;ummer in this part of the world, the twenty-fir&s;t of December being here the longe&s;t day; and every thing might ju&s;tly be dreaded from a phaenomenon which, in the corre&s;ponding &s;ea&s;on, is unknown even in Norway and Lapland.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 17.</NOTE>When the morning dawned, they &s;aw nothing round them, as far as the eye could reach, but &s;now, which &s;eemed to lie as thick upon the trees as upon the ground; and the bla&s;ts returned &s;o frequently, and with &s;uch violence, that they found it impo&s;&s;ible for them to &s;et out: how long this might la&s;t they knew not, and they had but too much rea&s;on to apprehend that it would confine them in that de&s;olate fore&s;t till they peri&s;hed with hunger and cold.</P>
<P>After having &s;uffered the mi&s;ery and terror of this &s;itua|tion till &s;ix o'clock in the morning, they conceived &s;ome hope of deliverance by di&s;covering the place of the &s;un through the clouds, which were become thinner, and began to break away. Their fir&s;t care was to &s;ee whether the poor wretches whom they had been obliged to leave among the bu&s;hes were yet alive; three of the company were di&s;patched for that purpo&s;e, and very &s;oon afterwards returned with the melan|choly news, that they were dead.</P>

They were now, however, pre&s;&s;ed by the calls of hunger, to which, after long fa&s;ting, every con&s;ideration of future good or evil immedi|ately gives way. Before they &s;et forward, therefore, it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that they &s;hould eat their vulture; the bird was accordingly &s;kinned, and, it being thought be&s;t to divide it before it was fit to be eaten, it was cut into ten por|tions, and every man cooked his own as he thought fit. After this repa&s;t, which furni&s;hed each of them with about three mouthfuls, they prepared to &s;et out; but it was ten o'clock before the &s;now was &s;ufficiently gone off to render a march practicable. After a walk of about three hours, they were very agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find them&s;elves upon the beach, and much nearer to the &s;hip than they had any rea|&s;on to expect. Upon reviewing their track from the ve&s;&s;el, they perceived, that, in&s;tead of a&s;cending the hill in a line, &s;o as to penetrate into the country, they had made almo&s;t a circle round it. When they came on board, they congratu|lated each other upon their &s;afety, with a joy that no man can feel who has not been expo&s;ed to equal danger; and as I had &s;uffered great anxiety at their not returning in the evening of the day on which they &s;et out, I was not wholly without my &s;hare.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January. Wedne&s;. 18. Thur&s;day. 19. Friday 20.</NOTE>ON the 18th and 19th, we were delayed in getting on board our wood and water by a &s;well: but on the 20th, the weather being more moderate, we again &s;ent the boat on &s;hore, and Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went in it. They landed in the bottom of the bay, and while my people were employed in the cutting brooms, they pur&s;ued their great object, the improvement of natural knowlege, with &s;ucce&s;s, collect|ing many &s;hells and plants which hitherto have been alto|gether unknown: they came on board to dinner, and after|wards went again on &s;hore to vi&s;it an Indian town, which &s;ome of the people had reported to lie about two miles up the country. They found the di&s;tance not more than by the account, and they approached it by what appeared to be the common road, yet they were above an hour in getting thi|ther, for they were frequently up to their knees in mud; when they got within a &s;mall di&s;tance, two of the people came out to meet them, with &s;uch &s;tate as they could a&s;&s;ume; when they joined them, they began to hallow as they had done on board the &s;hip, without addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves either to the &s;trangers or their companions; and having continued this &s;trange vociferation &s;ome time, they conducted them to the town. It was &s;ituated on a dry knoll, or &s;mall hill, covered with wood, none of which &s;eemed to have been cleared away, and con&s;i&s;ted of about twelve or fourteen hovels, of the mo&s;t

rude and inartificial &s;tructure that can be imagined.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> They were nothing more than a few poles &s;et up &s;o as to incline towards each other, and meet at the top, forming a kind of a cone, like &s;ome of our bee-hives: on the weather &s;ide they were covered with a few boughs, and a little gra&s;s; and on the lee fide about one eighth of the circle was left open, both for a door and a fire place; and of this kind were the huts that had been &s;een in St. Vincent's bay, in one of which the embers of a fire were &s;till remaining. Furniture they had none; a little gra&s;s, which lay round the in&s;ide of the hovel, &s;erved both for chairs and beds; and of all the uten&s;ils which nece&s;&s;ity and ingenuity have concurred to produce among other &s;avage nations, they &s;aw only a ba&s;ket to carry in the hand, a &s;atchel to hang at the back, and the bladder of &s;ome bea&s;t to hold water, which the natives drink through a hole that is made near the top for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this town were a &s;mall tribe, not more than fifty in number, of both &s;exes and of every age. Their colour re&s;embles that of the ru&s;t of iron mixed with oil, and they have long black hair: the men are large, but clum&s;ily built; their &s;tature is from five feet eight to five feet ten; the women are much le&s;s, few of them being more than five feet high. Their whole apparel con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;kin of a guanicoe, or &s;eal, which is thrown over their &s;houlders, exactly in the &s;tate in which it came from the animal's back; a piece of the &s;ame &s;kin, which is drawn over their feet, and gathered about the ancles like a pur&s;e, and a &s;mall flap, which is worn by the women as a &s;uccedaneum for a fig-leaf. The men wear their cloak open, the women tie it about their wai&s;t with a thong. But although they are con|tent to be naked, they are very ambitious to be fine. Their faces were painted in various forms: the region of the eye
<PB N="56" REF="71">
was in general white,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> and the re&s;t of the face adorned with horizontal &s;treaks of red and black; yet &s;carcely any two were exactly alike. This decoration &s;eems to be more pro|fu&s;e and elaborate upon particular occa&s;ions, for the two Gentlemen who introduced Mr. Banks and the Doctor into the town, were almo&s;t covered with &s;treaks of black in all directions, &s;o as to make a very &s;triking appearance. Both men and women wore bracelets of &s;uch beads as they could make them&s;elves of &s;mall &s;hells or bones; the women both upon their wri&s;ts and ancles, the men upon their wri&s;ts only; but to compen&s;ate for the want of bracelets on their legs, they wore a kind of fillet of brown wor&s;ted round their heads. They &s;eemed to &s;et a particular value upon any thing that was red, and preferred beads even to a knife or a hatchet.</P>
<P>Their language in general is guttural, and they expre&s;s &s;ome of their words by a &s;ound exactly like that which we make to clear the throat when any thing happens to ob&s;truct it; yet they have words which would be deemed &s;oft in the better languages of Europe. Mr. Banks learnt what he &s;up|po&s;es to be their name for beads and water. When they wanted beads, in&s;tead of ribbons or other trifles, they &s;aid <HI>halle~ca~</HI>; and when they were taken on &s;hore from the &s;hip, and by &s;igns a&s;ked where water might be found, they made the &s;ign of drinking, and pointing as well to the ca&s;ks as the watering place, cried <HI>Ood&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;aw no appearance of their having any food but &s;hell-fi&s;h; for though &s;eals were frequently &s;een near the &s;hore, they &s;eemed to have no implements for taking them. The &s;hell-fi&s;h is collected by the women, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it &s;eems to be to attend at low water, with a ba&s;ket in one hand, a &s;tick, pointed and barbed, in the other, and a &s;atchel at their backs: they loo&s;en the limpets, and other fi&s;h that adhere to
<PB N="57" REF="72">
the rocks, with the &s;tick, and put them into the ba&s;ket;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> which, when full, they empty into the &s;atchel.</P>
<P>The only things that we found among them in which there was the lea&s;t appearance of neatne&s;s or ingenuity, were their weapons, which con&s;i&s;ted of a bow and arrows. The bow was not inelegantly made, and the arrows were the neate&s;t that we had ever &s;een: they were of wood, poli&s;hed to the highe&s;t degree; and the point, which was of gla&s;s or flint, and barbed, was formed and fitted with wonderful dexterity. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome pieces of gla&s;s and flint among them unwrought, be&s;ides rings, buttons, cloth, and canva&s;s, with other European commodities; they mu&s;t therefore &s;ome|times travel to the northward, for it is many years &s;ince any &s;hip has been &s;o far &s;outh as this part of Terra del Fuego. We ob&s;erved al&s;o, that they &s;hewed no &s;urpri&s;e at our fire|arms, with the u&s;e of which they appeared to be well ac|quainted; for they made &s;igns to Mr. Banks to &s;hoot a &s;eal which followed the boat as they were going on &s;hore from the &s;hip.</P>
<P>M. de Bougainville, who, in January 1768, ju&s;t one year before us, had been on &s;hore upon this coa&s;t in latitude 53&deg; 40&prime; 41&Prime;, had, among other things, given gla&s;s to the people whom he found here; for he &s;ays, that a boy about twelve years old took it into his head to eat &s;ome of it: by this un|happy accident he died in great mi&s;ery; but the endeavours of the good father, the French <HI>Aumonier,</HI> were more &s;ucce&s;s|ful than tho&s;e of the Surgeon; for though the Surgeon could not &s;ave his life, the charitable Prie&s;t found means to &s;teal a Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m upon him &s;o &s;ecretly, that none of his Pa|gan relations knew any thing of the matter. The&s;e people might probably have &s;ome of the very gla&s;s which Bougain|ville left behind him, either from other natives, or perhaps
<PB N="58" REF="73">
from him&s;elf;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> for they appeared rather to be a travelling hord, than to have any fixed habitation. Their hou&s;es are built to &s;tand but for a &s;hort time; they have no uten&s;il or furniture but the ba&s;ket and &s;atchel, which have been men|tioned before, and which have handles adapted to the carry|ing them about, in the hand and upon the back; the only cloathing they had here was &s;carcely &s;ufficient to prevent their peri&s;hing with cold in the &s;ummer of this country, much le&s;s in the extreme &s;everity of winter; the &s;hell-fi&s;h which &s;eems to be their only food mu&s;t &s;oon be exhau&s;ted at any one place; and we had &s;een hou&s;es upon what appeared to be a de&s;erted &s;tation in St. Vincent's bay.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o probable that the place where we found them was only a temporary re&s;idence, from their having here no|thing like a boat or canoe, of which it can &s;carcely be &s;up|po&s;ed that they were wholly de&s;titute, e&s;pecially as they were not &s;ea-&s;ick, or particularly affected, either in our boat or on board the &s;hip. We conjectured that there might be a &s;treight or inlet, running from the &s;ea through great part of this i&s;land, from the Streight of Magellan, whence the&s;e people might come, leaving their canoes where &s;uch inlet termi|nated.</P>
<P>They did not appear to have among them any govern|ment or &s;ubordination: none was more re&s;pected than ano|ther; yet they &s;eemed to live together in the utmo&s;t harmony and good fellow&s;hip. Neither did we di&s;cover any appear|ance of religion among them, except the noi&s;es which have been mentioned, and which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;uper&s;titious ceremony, merely becau&s;e we could refer them to nothing el&s;e: they were u&s;ed only by one of tho&s;e who came on board the &s;hip, and the two who conducted Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to the town, whom we therefore conjectured to be
<PB N="59" REF="74">
prie&s;ts. Upon the whole,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> the&s;e people appeared to be the mo&s;t de&s;titute and forlorn, as well as the mo&s;t &s;tupid of all human beings; the outca&s;ts of Nature, who &s;pent their lives in wandering about the dreary wa&s;tes, where two of our people peri&s;hed with cold in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer; with no dwelling but a wretched hovel of &s;ticks and gra&s;s, which would not only admit the wind, but the &s;now and the rain; almo&s;t naked; and de&s;titute of every convenience that is fur|ni&s;hed by the rude&s;t art, having no implement even to dre&s;s their food: yet they were content. They &s;eemed to have no wi&s;h for any thing more than they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, nor did anything that we offered them appear acceptable but beads, as an ornamental &s;uperfluity of life. What bodily pain they might &s;uffer from the &s;everities of their winter we could not know; but it is certain, that they &s;uffered nothing from the want of the innumerable articles which we con&s;ider, not as the luxuries and conveniencies only, but the nece&s;&s;aries of life: as their de&s;ires are few, they probably enjoy them all; and how much they may be gainers by an exemption from the care, labour and &s;olicitude, which ari&s;e from a perpetual and un&s;ucce&s;sful effort to gratify that infinite variety of de|&s;ires which the refinements of artificial life have produced among us, is not very ea&s;y to determine: po&s;&s;ibly this may counterbalance all the real di&s;advantages of their &s;ituation in compari&s;on with ours, and make the &s;cales by which good and evil are di&s;tributed to man, hang even between us.</P>
<P>In this place we &s;aw no quadruped except &s;eals, &s;ea-lions, and dogs; of the dogs it is remarkable that they bark, which tho&s;e that are originally bred in America do not. And this is a further proof, that the people we &s;aw here had, either immediately or remotely, communicated with the inhabi|tants of Europe. There are, however, other quadrupeds in this part of the country; for when Mr. Banks was at the top
<PB N="60" REF="75">
of the highe&s;t hill that he a&s;cended in his expedition through the woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> he &s;aw the foot&s;teps of a large bea&s;t imprinted upon the &s;urface of a bog, though he could not with any probability gue&s;s of what kind it might be.</P>
<P>Of land-birds there are but few; Mr. Banks &s;aw none larger than an Engli&s;h blackbird, except &s;ome hawks and a vulture; but of water-fowl there is great plenty, particularly ducks. Of fi&s;h we &s;aw &s;carce any, and with our hooks could catch none that was fit to eat; but &s;hell-fi&s;h, limpets, clams, and mu&s;cles were to be found in abundance.</P>
<P>Among the in&s;ects, which were not numerous, there was neither gnat nor mu&s;quito, nor any other &s;pecies that was either hurtful or trouble&s;ome, which perhaps is more than can be &s;aid of any other uncleared country. During the &s;now-bla&s;ts, which happened every day while we were here, they hide them&s;elves; and the moment it is fair they appear again, as nimble and vigorous as the warme&s;t weather could make them.</P>
<P>Of plants, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander found a va&s;t va|riety; the far greater part wholly different from any that have been hitherto de&s;cribed. Be&s;ides the birch, and winter's bark, which have been mentioned already, there is the beach, <HI>Fagus antarcticus,</HI> which, as well as the birch, may be u&s;ed for timber. The plants cannot be enumerated here; but as the &s;curvy-gra&s;s, <HI>Cardamine anti&s;corbutica,</HI> and the wild celery, <HI>Apium antarcticum,</HI> probably contain anti&s;corbutic qua|lities, which may be of great benefit to the crews of &s;uch &s;hips as &s;hall hereafter touch at this place, the following &s;hort de&s;cription is in&s;erted:</P>
<P>The &s;curvy-gra&s;s will be found in plenty in damp places, near &s;prings of water, and in general in all places that lie near the beach, e&s;pecially at the watering-place in the Bay
<PB N="61" REF="76">
of Good Succe&s;s: when it is young,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> the &s;tate of its greate&s;t perfection, it lies flat upon the ground, having many leaves of a bright green, &s;tanding in pairs oppo&s;ite to each other, with a &s;ingle one at the end, which generally makes the fifth upon a foot &s;talk: the plant, pa&s;&s;ing from this &s;tate, &s;hoots up in &s;talks that are &s;ometimes two feet high, at the top of which are &s;mall white blo&s;&s;oms, and the&s;e are &s;ucceeded by long pods: the whole plant greatly re&s;embles that which in England is called Lady's &s;mock, or Cuckow-flower. The wild celery is very like the celery in our gardens, the flowers are white, and &s;tand in the &s;ame manner, in &s;mall tufts at the top of the branches, but the leaves are of a deeper green. It grows in great abundance near the beach, and generally upon the &s;oil that lies next above the &s;pring tides. It may indeed ea&s;ily be known by the ta&s;te, which is between that of celery and par&s;ley. We u&s;ed the celery in large quanti|ties, particularly in our &s;oup, which, thus medicated, pro|duced the &s;ame good effects which &s;eamen generally derive from a vegetable diet, after having been long confined to &s;alt provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>On Sunday, the 22d of January,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 22.</NOTE> about two o'clock in the morning, having got our wood and water on board, we &s;ailed out of the Bay, and continued our cour&s;e through the Streight.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> A general De&s;cription of the S. E. part of Terra del Fuego, and the Streight of Le Maire; with &s;ome Remarks on Lord An&s;on's Account of them, and Directions for the Pa&s;&s;age We&s;tward, round this Part of America, into the South Seas.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE>ALMOST an writers who have mentioned the i&s;land of Terra del Fuego, de&s;cribe it as de&s;titute of wood, and covered with &s;now. In the winter it may po&s;&s;ibly be covered with &s;now, and tho&s;e who &s;aw it at that &s;ea&s;on might per|haps be ea&s;ily deceived, by its appearance, into an opinion that it was de&s;titute of wood. Lord An&s;on was there in the beginning of March, which an&s;wers to our September; and we were there the beginning of January, which an&s;wers to our July, which may account for the difference of his de|&s;cription of it from ours. We fell in with it about twenty-one leagues to the we&s;tward of the Streight of Le Maire, and from the time that we fir&s;t &s;aw it, trees were plainly to be di&s;tingui&s;hed with our gla&s;&s;es; and as we came nearer, though here and there we di&s;covered patches of &s;now, the &s;ides of the hills and the &s;ea-coa&s;t appeared to be covered with a beautiful verdure. The hills are lofty, but not mountainous, though the &s;ummits of them are quite naked. The &s;oil in the valleys is rich, and of a con&s;iderable depth; and at the foot of almo&s;t every hill there is a brook, the water of which has a reddi&s;h hue, like that which runs through our turf bogs in England, but it is by no means ill ta&s;ted, and upon
<PB N="63" REF="78">
the whole proved to be the be&s;t that we took in during our voyage. We ranged the coa&s;t to the Streight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> and had found|ings all the way from 40 to 20 fathom, upon a gravelly and &s;andy bottom. The mo&s;t remarkable land on Terra del Fuego is a hill, in the form of a &s;ugar-loaf, which &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide not far from the &s;ea; and the three hills, called the three brothers, about nine miles to the we&s;tward of Cape St. Diego, the low point that forms the north entrance of the Streight of Le Maire.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid in the account of Lord An&s;on's voyage, that it is difficult to determine exactly where the Streight lies, though the appearance of Terra del Fuego be well known, without knowing al&s;o the appearance of Staten Land; and that &s;ome navigators have been deceived by three hills on Staten Land, which have been mi&s;taken for the three brothers on Terra del Fuego, and &s;o over-&s;hot the Streight. But no &s;hip can po&s;&s;ibly mi&s;s the Streight that coa&s;ts Terra del Fuego within &s;ight of land, for it will then, of it&s;elf, be &s;ufficiently con|&s;picuous; and Staten Land, which forms the ea&s;t &s;ide, will be &s;till more manife&s;tly di&s;tingui&s;hed, for there is no land on Terra del Fuego like it. The Streight of Le Maire can be mi&s;&s;ed only by &s;tanding too far to the ea&s;tward, without keeping the land of Terra del Fuego in &s;ight: if this is done, it may be mi&s;&s;ed, however accurately the appearance of the coa&s;t of Staten Land may have been exhibited; and if this is not done, it cannot be mi&s;&s;ed, though the appearance of that coa&s;t be not known. The entrance of the Streight &s;hould not be attempted but with a fair wind and moderate wea|ther, and upon the very beginning of the tide of flood, which happens here, at the full and change of the moon, about one or two o'clock; it is al&s;o be&s;t to keep as near to the Terra del Fuego &s;hore as the winds will admit. By attending to the&s;e particulars, a &s;hip may be got quite through the
<PB N="64" REF="79">
Streight in one tide;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> or, at lea&s;t, to the &s;outhward of Succe&s;s Bay, into which it will be more prudent to put, if the wind &s;hould be &s;outherly, than to attempt the weathering of Staten Land with a lee wind and a current, which may endanger her being driven on that i&s;land.</P>
<P>The Streight it&s;elf, which is bounded on the we&s;t by Terra del Fuego, and on the ea&s;t by the we&s;t end of Staten Land, is about five leagues long, and as many broad. The Bay of Good Succe&s;s lies about the middle of it, on the Terra del Fuego &s;ide, and is di&s;covered immediately upon entering the Streight from the northward; and the &s;outh head of it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed by a mark on the land, that has the appear|ance of a broad road, leading up from the &s;ea into the coun|try: at the entrance it is half a league wide, and runs in we&s;tward about two miles and an half. There is good an|chorage in every part of it, in from ten to &s;even fathom, clear ground; and it affords plenty of exceeding good wood and water. The tides flow in the Bay, at the full and change of the moon, about four or five o'clock, and ri&s;e about five or &s;ix feet perpendicular. But the flood runs two or three hours longer in the Streight than in the Bay; and the ebb, or northerly current, runs with near double the &s;trength of the flood.</P>
<P>In the appearance of Staten Land, we did not di&s;cover the wildne&s;s and horror that is a&s;cribed to it in the account of Lord An&s;on's voyage. On the north &s;ide are the appearances of bays or harbours; and the land, when we &s;aw it, was nei|ther de&s;titute of wood nor verdure, nor covered with &s;now. The i&s;land &s;eems to be about twelve leagues in length, and five broad.</P>
<P>On the we&s;t &s;ide of the Cape of Good Succe&s;s, which forms the S. W. entrance of the Streight, lies Valentine's Bay, of
<PB N="65" REF="80">
which we only &s;aw the entrance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> from this bay the land trends away to the W. S. W. for twenty or thirty leagues; it appears to be high and mountainous, and forms &s;everal bays and inlets.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of fourteen leagues from the bay of Good Succe&s;s, in the direction of S. W. &frac12; W. and between two and three leagues from the &s;hore, lies New I&s;land. It is about two leagues in length from N. E. to S. W. and terminates to the N. E. in a remarkable hillock. At the di&s;tance of &s;even leagues from New I&s;land, in the direction of S. W. lies the i&s;le <HI>Evouts</HI>; and a little to the we&s;t of the &s;outh of this i&s;land lie Barnevelt's two &s;mall flat i&s;lands, clo&s;e to each other; they are partly &s;urrounded with rocks, which ri&s;e to different heights above the water, and lie twenty-four leagues from the Streight of Le Maire. At the di&s;tance of three leagues from Barnevelt's i&s;lands, in the direction of S. W. by S. lies the S. E. point of Hermit's i&s;lands: the&s;e i&s;lands lie S. E. and N. W. and are pretty high: from mo&s;t points of view they will be taken for one i&s;land, or a part of the main.</P>
<P>From the S. E. point of Hermit's i&s;lands to Cape Horn the cour&s;e is S.W. by S. di&s;tance three leagues.</P>
<P>The appearance of this Cape and Hermit's i&s;lands is re|pre&s;ented in the chart of this coa&s;t, from our fir&s;t making land to the Cape, which includes the Streight of Le Maire, and part of Staten Land. In this chart I have laid down no land, nor traced out any &s;hore but what I &s;aw my&s;elf, and thus far it may be depended upon: the bays and in|lets, of which we &s;aw only the openings, are not traced; it can, however, &s;carcely be doubted, but that mo&s;t, if not all of them, afford anchorage, wood and water. The Dutch &s;quadron, commanded by Hermit, certainly put into &s;ome of them in the year 1624; and was Chapenham, the Vice

Admiral of this &s;quadron,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> who fir&s;t di&s;covered that the land of Cape Horn con&s;i&s;ted of a number of i&s;lands. The account, however, which tho&s;e who &s;ailed in Hermit's fleet have given of the&s;e parts is extremely defective; and tho&s;e of Schouton and Le Maire are &s;till wor&s;e: it is therefore no wonder that the charts hitherto publi&s;hed &s;hould be erro|neous, not only in laying down the land, but in the latitude and longitude of the places they contain. I will, however, venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the longitude of few parts of the world is better a&s;certained than that of the Streight of Le Maire, and Cape Horn, in the chart now offered to the public, as it was laid down by &s;everal ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, that were made both by my&s;elf and Mr. Green.</P>
<P>The variation of the compa&s;s on this coa&s;t I found to be from 23&deg; to 25&deg; E. except near Barnevelt's i&s;lands and Cape Horn, where we found it le&s;s, and un&s;ettled; probably it is di&s;turbed here by the land, as Hermit's &s;quadron, in this very place found all their compa&s;&s;es differ from each other. The declination of the dipping-needle, when &s;et up on &s;hore in Succe&s;s Bay, was 68&deg; 15&prime; below the horizon.</P>
<P>Between Streight Le Maire and Cape Horn, we found a current &s;etting, generally very &s;trong, to the N. E. when we were in with the &s;hore; but lo&s;t it when we were at the di&s;|tance of fifteen or twenty leagues.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 26.</NOTE>On the 26th of January, we took our departure from Cape Horn, which lies in latitude 55&deg; 53&prime; S. longitude 68&deg; 13&prime; W. The farthe&s;t &s;outhern latitude that we made was 60&deg; 10&prime;, our longitude was then 74&deg; 30&prime; W.; and we found the va|riation of the compa&s;s, by the mean of eighteen azimuths, to be 27&deg; 9&prime; E. As the weather was frequently calm, Mr. Banks went out in a &s;mall boat to &s;hoot birds, among which were &s;ome albatro&s;&s;es and &s;heerwaters. The albatro&s;&s;es were ob|&s;erved
<PB N="67" REF="82">
to be larger than tho&s;e which had been taken north|ward of the Streight;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. January.</NOTE> one of them mea&s;ured ten feet two inches from the tip of one wing to that of the other, when they were extended: the &s;heerwater, on the contrary, is le&s;s, and darker coloured on the back. The albatro&s;&s;es we &s;kin|ned, and having &s;oaked them in &s;alt water till the morning, we parboiled them, then throwing away the liquor, &s;tewed them in a very little fre&s;h water till they were tender, and had them &s;erved up with &s;avoury &s;auce; thus dre&s;&s;ed, the di&s;h was univer&s;ally commended, and we eat of it very hear|tily even when there was fre&s;h pork upon the table.</P>
<P>From a variety of ob&s;ervations which were made with great care, it appeared probable in the highe&s;t degree, that, from the time of our leaving the land to the 13th of Febru|ary, when we were in latitude 49&deg; 32&prime;, and longitude 90&deg; 37&prime;,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February. Monday 13.</NOTE> we had no current to the we&s;t.</P>
<P>At this time we had advanced about 12&deg; to the we&s;tward, and 3 and &frac12; to the northward of the Streight of Magellan: having been ju&s;t three and thirty days in coming round the land of Terra del Fuego, or Cape Horn, from the ea&s;t en|trance of the Streight to this &s;ituation. And though the doubling of Cape Horn is &s;o much dreaded, that, in the ge|neral opinion, it is more eligible to pa&s;s through the Streight of Magellan, we were not once brought under our clo&s;e reef'd top&s;ails after we left the Streight of Le Maire. The Dolphin in her la&s;t voyage, which &s;he performed at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on of the year with ours, was three months in getting through the Streight of Magellan, exclu&s;ive of the time that &s;he lay in Port Famine; and I am per&s;uaded, from the winds we had, that if we had come by that pa&s;&s;age, we &s;hould not at this time have been in the&s;e &s;eas; that our people would have been fatigued, and our anchors, cables, &s;ails and rig|ging
<PB N="68" REF="83">
much damaged;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. February.</NOTE> neither of which inconveniencies we had now &s;uffered. But &s;uppo&s;ing it more eligible to go round the Cape, than through the Streight of Magellan; it may &s;till be que&s;tioned, whether it is better to go through the Streight of Le Maire, or &s;tand to the ea&s;tward, and go round Staten Land. The advice given in the Account of Lord An&s;on's voyage is, <Q>That all &s;hips bound to the South Seas, in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing through the Streight of Le Maire, &s;hould con&s;tantly pa&s;s to the ea&s;tward of Staten Land, and &s;hould be invariably bent on running to the &s;outhward as far as the latitude of 61 or 62 degrees, before they endea|vour to &s;tand to the we&s;tward.</Q> But, in my opinion, dif|ferent circum&s;tances may at one time render it eligible to pa&s;s through the Streight, and to keep to the ea&s;tward of Staten Land at another. If the land is fallen in with to the we&s;tward of the Streight, and the wind is favourable for going through, I think it would be very injudicious to lo&s;e time by going round Staten Land, as I am confident that, by attending to the directions which I have given, the Streight may be pa&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t &s;afety and convenience: but if, on the contrary, the land is fallen in with to the ea&s;tward of the Streight, and the wind &s;hould prove tempe&s;tuous or unfavourable, I think it would be be&s;t to go round Staten Land. But I cannot in any ca&s;e concur in recommending the running into the latitude of 61 or 62, before any endea|vour is made to &s;tand to the we&s;tward. We found neither the current nor the &s;torms which the running &s;o far to the &s;outhward is &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary to avoid; and indeed, as the winds almo&s;t con&s;tantly blow from that quarter, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue the advice. The navigator has no choice but to &s;tand to the &s;outhward, clo&s;e upon a wind, and by keeping upon that tack, he will not only make &s;outhing, but we&s;ting; and, if the wind varies towards the north of
<PB N="69" REF="84">
the we&s;t, his we&s;ting will be con&s;iderable. It will, indeed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. February.</NOTE> be highly proper to make &s;ure of a we&s;ting &s;ufficient to double all the lands, before an attempt is made to &s;tand to the northward, and to this every man's own prudence will of nece&s;&s;ity direct him.</P>
<P>We now began to have &s;trong gales and heavy &s;eas, with irregular intervals of calm and fine weather.</P>

<P>ON the 1&s;t of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March. Wedne&s;. 1.</NOTE> we were in latitude 38&deg; 44&prime; S. and longitude 110&deg; 33&prime; W. both by ob&s;ervation and by the log. This agreement, after a run of 660 leagues, was thought to be very extraordinary; and is a demon&s;tration, that after we left the land of Cape Horn we had no current that affected the &s;hip. It renders it al&s;o highly probable, that we had been near no land of any con&s;iderable extent; for currents are always found when land is not remote, and &s;ometimes, particularly on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the continent in the North Sea, when land has been di&s;tant 100 leagues.</P>
<P>Many birds, as u&s;ual, were con&s;tantly about the &s;hip, &s;o that Mr. Banks killed no le&s;s than 62 in one day; and what is more remarkable, he caught two fore&s;t flies, both of them of the &s;ame &s;pecies, but different from any that have hither|to

Mr. Banks al&s;o, about this time, found a large cuttle-fi&s;h, which had ju&s;t been killed by the birds, floating in a mangled condition upon the water; it was very different from the cuttle-fi&s;hes that are found in the Euro|pean &s;eas; for its arms, in&s;tead of &s;uckers, were furni&s;hed with a double row of very &s;harp talons, which re&s;embled tho&s;e of a cat, and, like them, were retractable into a &s;heath of &s;kin, from which they might be thru&s;t at plea&s;ure. Of this cuttle-fi&s;h we made one of the be&s;t &s;oups we had ever ta&s;ted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 8.</NOTE>The albatro&s;&s;es now began to leave us, and after the 8th there was not one to be &s;een.

It was a general opinion, that there was land to windward; but I did not think my&s;elf at liberty to &s;earch for what I was not &s;ure to find; though I judged we were not far from the i&s;lands that were di&s;covered by Quiros in 1606. Our latitude was 22&deg; 11&prime;S. and longitude 127&deg; 55&prime;W.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 25.</NOTE>On the 25th, about noon, one of the marines, a young fellow about twenty, was placed as centry at the cabbin door; while he was upon this duty, one of my &s;ervants was at the &s;ame place preparing to cut a piece of &s;eal-&s;kin into tobacco-pouches: he had promi&s;ed one to &s;everal of the men, but had refu&s;ed one to this young fellow, though he had a&s;ked him &s;everal times; upon which he jocularly threatened to &s;teal one, if it &s;hould be in his power. It happened that the &s;er|vant being called ha&s;tily away, gave the &s;kin in charge to
<PB N="71" REF="86">
the centinel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. March. Saturday 25.</NOTE> without regarding what had pa&s;&s;ed between them. The centinel immediately &s;ecured a piece of the &s;kin, which the other mi&s;&s;ing at his return, grew angry; but after &s;ome altercation, contented him&s;elf with taking it away, de|claring, that, for &s;o trifling an affair, he would not complain of him to the officers. But it happened that one of his fellow &s;oldiers, over-hearing the di&s;pute, came to the knowlege of what had happened, and told it to the re&s;t; who, taking it into their heads to &s;tand up for the honour of their corps, reproached the offender with great bitterne&s;s, and reviled him in the mo&s;t opprobrious terms; they exaggerated his offence into a crime of the deepe&s;t die; they &s;aid it was a theft by a centry when he was upon duty, and of a thing that had been committed to his tru&s;t; they declared it a di&s;|grace to a&s;&s;ociate with him; and the Serjeant, in particular, &s;aid that, if the per&s;on from whom the &s;kin had been &s;tolen would not complain, he would complain him&s;elf; for that his honour would &s;uffer if the offender was not puni&s;hed. From the &s;coffs and reproaches of the&s;e men of honour, the poor young fellow retired to his hammock in an agony of confu&s;ion and &s;hame. The Serjeant &s;oon after went to him, and ordered him to follow him to the deck: he obeyed with|out reply; but it being in the du&s;k of the evening, he &s;lip|ped from the Serjeant and went forward: he was &s;een by &s;ome of the people, who thought he was gone to the head; but a &s;earch being made for him afterwards, it was found that he had thrown him&s;elf overboard; and I was then fir&s;t made acquainted with the theft and its circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of this man was the more regretted as he was remarkably quiet and indu&s;trious, and as the very action that put an end to his life was a proof of an ingenuous mind; for to &s;uch only di&s;grace is in&s;upportable.</P>

<P><PB N="72" REF="89"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Tue&s;day 4. Lagoon I&s;land.</NOTE>On Tue&s;day the 4th of April, about ten o'clock in the morning, Mr. Banks's &s;ervant, Peter Bri&s;coe, di&s;covered land, bearing &s;outh, at the di&s;tance of about three or four leagues. I immediately hauled up for it, and found it to be an i&s;land of an oval form, with a lagoon in the middle, which occu|pied much the larger part of it; the border of land which circum&s;cribes the lagoon is in many places very low and narrow, particularly on the &s;outh &s;ide, where it con&s;i&s;ts principally of a beach or reef of rocks: it has the &s;ame ap|pearance al&s;o in three places on the north &s;ide; &s;o that, the firm land being disjoined, the whole looks like many i&s;lands covered with wood. On the we&s;t end of the i&s;land is a large tree or clump of trees, that in appearance re&s;embles a tower; and about the middle are two cocoa-nut trees, which ri&s;e above all the re&s;t, and, as we came near to the i&s;land, appeared like a flag. We approached it on the north &s;ide, and though we came within a mile, we found no bottom with 130 fathom of line, nor did there appear to be any anchorage about it. The whole is covered with trees of different verdure, but we could di&s;tingui&s;h none, even with our gla&s;&s;es, except cocoa-nuts and palm-nuts. We &s;aw &s;everal of the natives upon the &s;hore, and counted four and twenty. They appeared to be tall, and to have heads re|markably large; perhaps they had &s;omething wound round them which we could not di&s;tingui&s;h; they were of a copper colour, and had long black hair. Eleven of them walked along the beach abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, with poles or pikes in their hands which reached twice as high as them&s;elves: while they walked on the beach they &s;eemed to be naked; but &s;oon after they retired, which they did as &s;oon as the &s;hip had pa&s;&s;ed the i&s;land, they covered them&s;elves with &s;omething that made them appear of a light colour. Their habitations were under &s;ome clumps of palm-nut trees,
<PB N="73" REF="90">
which at a di&s;tance appeared like high ground; and to us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Tue&s;day 4.</NOTE> who for a long time had &s;een nothing but water and &s;ky, except the dreary hills of Terra del Fuego, the&s;e groves &s;eemed a terre&s;trial paradi&s;e. To this &s;pot, which lies in latitude 18&deg; 47&prime; S. and longitude 139&deg; 28&prime; W. we gave the name of LAGOON ISLAND. The variation of the needle here is 2&deg; 54&prime; E.</P>
<P>About one o'clock we made &s;ail to the we&s;tward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umb-Cap.</NOTE> and about half an hour after three we &s;aw land again to the N. W. We got up with it at &s;un&s;et, and it proved to be a low woody i&s;land, of a circular form, and not much above a mile in compa&s;s. We di&s;covered no inhabitants, nor could we di&s;tin|gui&s;h any cocoa-nut trees, though we were within half a mile of the &s;hore. The land, however, was covered with verdure of many hues. It lies in latitude 18&deg; 35&prime; S. and longitude 139&deg; 48&prime; W. and is di&s;tant from Lagoon I&s;land, in the direc|tion of N. 62 W. about &s;even leagues. We called it THRUMB-CAP. I di&s;covered, by the appearance of the &s;hore, that at this place it was low-water; and I had ob&s;erved at Lagoon I&s;land, that it was either high-water, or that the &s;ea neither ebbed nor flowed: I infer, therefore, that a S. by E. or S. moon makes high-water.</P>
<P>We went on with a fine trade-wind and plea&s;ant weather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 5. Bow I&s;land.</NOTE> and on the 5th, about three in the afternoon, we di&s;covered land to the we&s;tward. It proved to be a low i&s;land, of much greater extent than either of tho&s;e that we had &s;een before, being about ten or twelve leagues in compa&s;s. Several of us remained at the ma&s;t-head the whole evening, admiring its extraordinary figure: it was &s;haped exactly like a bow, the arch and cord of which were land, and the &s;pace between them water; the cord was a flat beach, without any &s;igns of vegetation, having nothing upon it but heaps of &s;ea weed,
<PB N="74" REF="91">
which lay in different ridges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Wedne&s;. 5.</NOTE> as higher or lower tides had left them. It appeared to be about three or four leagues long, and not more than two hundred yards wide; but as a horizontal plain is always &s;een in per&s;pective, and greatly fore-&s;hortened, it is certainly much wider than it appeared: the horns, or extremities of the bow, were two large tufts of cocoa-nut trees; and much the greater part of the arch was covered with trees of different height, figure and hue; in &s;ome parts, however, it was naked and low like the cord: &s;ome of us thought they di&s;covered openings through the cord, into the pool, or lake, that was included between that and the bow; but whether there were or were not &s;uch openings is un|certain. We &s;ailed abrea&s;t of the low beach, or bow-&s;tring, within le&s;s than a league of the &s;hore, till &s;un&s;et, and we then judged our&s;elves to be about half way between the two horns: here we brought to, and &s;ounded, but found no bot|tom with one hundred and thirty fathom; and, as it is dark almo&s;t in&s;tantly after &s;un&s;et in the&s;e latitudes, we &s;uddenly lo&s;t &s;ight of the land, and making &s;ail again, before the line was well hauled in, we &s;teered by the &s;ound of the breakers, which were di&s;tinctly heard till we got clear of the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>We knew this i&s;land to be inhabited, by &s;moke which we &s;aw in different parts of it, and we gave it the name of Bow ISLAND. Mr. Gore, my Second Lieutenant, &s;aid, after we had &s;ailed by the i&s;land, that he had &s;een &s;everal of the na|tives, under the fir&s;t clump of trees, from the deck; that he had di&s;tingui&s;hed their hou&s;es, and &s;een &s;everal canoes hauled up under the &s;hade; but in this he was more fortunate than any other per&s;on on board. The ea&s;t end of this i&s;land, which from its figure we called the Bow, lies in latitude 18&deg; 23&prime; S. and longitude 141&deg; 12&prime; W. we ob&s;erved the varia|tion of the compa&s;s to be 5&deg; 38&prime; E.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="92">On the next day, Thur&s;day the 6th, about noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Thur&s;day 6. The Groups.</NOTE> we &s;aw land again to the we&s;tward, and came up with it about three. It appeared to be two i&s;lands, or rather groups of i&s;lands, extending from N.W. by N. to S.E. by S. about nine leagues. Of the&s;e, the two large&s;t were &s;eparated from each other by a channel of about half a mile broad, and were &s;everally &s;urrounded by &s;maller i&s;lands, to which they were joined by reefs that lay under water.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands were long narrow &s;trips of land, ranging in all directions, &s;ome of them ten miles or upwards in length, but none more than a quarter of a mile broad, and upon all of them there were trees of various kinds, particularly the cocoa-nut. The &s;outh-ea&s;termo&s;t of them lies in the latitude of 18&deg; 12&prime; S. and longitude 142&deg; 42&prime; W. and at the di&s;tance of twenty-five leagues, in the direction of W. &frac12; N. from the we&s;t end of Bow I&s;land. We ranged along the S. W. &s;ide of this i&s;land, and hauled into a bay which lies to the N. W. of the &s;outhermo&s;t point of the Group, where there was a &s;mooth &s;ea, and the appearance of anchorage, without much &s;urf on the &s;hore. We &s;ounded, but we found no bottom with one hundred fathom, at the di&s;tance of no more than three quarters of a mile from the beach, and I did not think it prudent to go nearer.</P>
<P>While this was doing, &s;everal of the inhabitants a&s;&s;embled upon the &s;hore, and &s;ome came out in their canoes as far as the reefs, but would not pa&s;s them: when we &s;aw this, we ranged, with an ea&s;y &s;ail, along the &s;hore; but ju&s;t as we were pa&s;&s;ing the end of the i&s;land, &s;ix men, who had for &s;ome time kept abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, &s;uddenly launched two canoes with great quickne&s;s and dexterity, and three of them getting into each, they put off, as we imagined with a de&s;ign to come on board us; the &s;hip was therefore brought
<PB N="76" REF="93">
to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Thur&s;day 6.</NOTE> but they, like their fellows, &s;topped at the reef; we did not however immediately make &s;ail, as we ob&s;erved two me&s;&s;engers di&s;patched to them from the other canoes, which were of a much larger &s;ize: we perceived that the&s;e me&s;|&s;engers made great expedition, wading and &s;wimming along the reef; at length they met, and the men on board the ca|noes making no di&s;po&s;itions to pa&s;s the reef, after having received the me&s;&s;age, we judged that they had re&s;olved to come no farther: after waiting, therefore, &s;ome little time longer, we &s;tood off; but when we were got about two or three miles from the &s;hore, we perceived &s;ome of the natives following us in a canoe with a &s;ail; we did not, however, think it worth while to wait for her, and though &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed the reef, &s;he &s;oon after gave over the chace.</P>
<P>According to the be&s;t judgment that we could form of the people when we were neare&s;t the &s;hore, they were about our &s;ize, and well-made. They were of a brown complexion, and appeared to be naked; their hair, which was black, was confined by a fillet that went round the head, and &s;tuck out behind like a bu&s;h. The greater part of them carried in their hands two weapons; one of them was a &s;lender pole, from ten to fourteen feet long, on one end of which was a &s;mall knob, not unlike the point of a &s;pear; the other was about four feet long, and &s;haped like a paddle, and po&s;&s;ibly might be &s;o, for &s;ome of their canoes were very &s;mall: tho&s;e which we &s;aw them launch &s;eemed not intended to carry more than the three men that got into them: we &s;aw others that had on board &s;ix or &s;even men, and one of them hoi&s;ted a &s;ail which did not &s;eem to reach more than &s;ix feet above the gunwale of the boat, and which, upon the falling of a &s;light &s;hower, was taken down and converted into an awning or tilt. The canoe which followed us to &s;ea hoi&s;ted a &s;ail not
<PB N="77" REF="94">
unlike an Engli&s;h lug-&s;ail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Thur&s;day 6.</NOTE> and almo&s;t as lofty as an Engli&s;h boat of the &s;ame &s;ize would have carried.</P>
<P>The people, who kept abrea&s;t of the &s;hip on the beach, made many &s;ignals; but whether they were intended to frighten us away, or invite us on &s;hore, it is not ea&s;y to de|termine: we returned them by waving our hats and &s;hout|ing, and they replied by &s;houting again. We did not put their di&s;po&s;ition to the te&s;t, by attempting to land; becau&s;e, as the i&s;land was incon&s;iderable, and as we wanted nothing that it could afford, we thought it imprudent as well as cruel to ri&s;k a conte&s;t, in which the natives mu&s;t have &s;uf|fered by our &s;uperiority, merely to gratify an idle curio&s;ity; e&s;pecially as we expected &s;oon to fall in with the i&s;land where we had been directed to make our a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervation, the inhabitants of which would probably admit us without oppo&s;ition, as they were already acquainted with our &s;trength, and might al&s;o procure us a ready and peaceable reception among the neighbouring people, if we &s;hould define it.</P>
<P>To the&s;e i&s;lands we gave the name of THE GROUPS.</P>
<P>On the 7th, about half an hour after &s;ix in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 7.

The &s;mall i&s;lands and reefs that circum&s;cribe the lake have the appearance of a chain, and we therefore gave it the name of CHAIN ISLAND. Its length &s;eemed to be about five leagues, in the direction of N.W. and S.E. and its breadth about five miles. The trees upon it appeared to be large, and we &s;aw &s;moke ri&s;ing in dif|ferent parts of it from among them, a certain &s;ign that it was inhabited.

The next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 11.</NOTE> however, at &s;ix o'clock, we were convinced that tho&s;e who &s;aid they had di&s;covered land, were not mi&s;taken; it appeared to be very high and mountainous, extending from W. by S. &frac12; S. to W. by N. &frac12; N. and we knew it to be the &s;ame that Captain Wallis had called King George the III.'s I&s;land. We were delayed in our approach to it by light airs and calms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 12.</NOTE> &s;o that in the morning of the 12th we were but little nearer than we had been the night before; but about &s;even a breeze &s;prung up, and before eleven &s;everal canoes were &s;een mak|ing towards the &s;hip: there were but few of them, however, that would come near; and the people in tho&s;e that did, could not be per&s;uaded to come on board. In every canoe there were young plantains, and branches of a tree which the Indians call <HI>E' Midho</HI>; the&s;e, as we afterwards learnt, were brought as tokens of peace and amity, and the people in one of the canoes handed them up the &s;ip's &s;ide, making &s;ignals

We then purcha&s;ed their cargoes, con&s;i&s;ting of cocoa-nuts, and various kinds of fruit, which after our long voyage were very acceptable.</P>
<P>We &s;tood on with an ea&s;y &s;ail all night, with &s;oundings from 22 fathom to 12,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 13.</NOTE> and about &s;even o'clock in the morn|ing we came to an anchor in 13 fathom, in Port-royal bay, called by the natives <HI>Matavai.</HI> We were immediately &s;ur|rounded by the natives in their canoes, who gave us cocoa-nuts, fruit re&s;embling apples, bread-fruit, and &s;ome &s;mall fi&s;hes, in exchange for beads and other trifles. They had with them a pig, which they would not part with for any thing but a hatchet, and therefore we refu&s;ed to purcha&s;e it; becau&s;e, if we gave them a hatchet for a pig now, we knew they would never afterwards &s;ell one for le&s;s, and we could not afford to buy as many as it was probable we &s;hould want at that price. The bread-fruit grows on a tree that is about the &s;ize of a middling oak: its leaves are frequently a foot and an half long, of an oblong &s;hape, deeply &s;inuated like tho&s;e of the fig-tree, which they re&s;emble in con&s;i&s;tence and colour, and in the exuding of a white milky juice upon being broken. The fruit is about the &s;ize and &s;hape of a child's head, and the &s;urface is reticulated not much unlike a truffle: it is covered with a thin &s;kin, and has a core about as big as the handle of a &s;mall knife: the eatable part lies between the &s;kin and the core; it is as white as &s;now, and &s;omewhat of the con&s;i&s;tence of new bread: it mu&s;t be roa&s;ted before it is eaten, being fir&s;t divided into three or four parts:

<P>As &s;oon as the &s;hip was properly &s;ecured, I went on &s;hore with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, a party of men under arms, and our friend Owhaw. We were received from the boat by &s;ome hundreds of the inhabitants, who&s;e looks at lea&s;t gave us welcome, though they were &s;truck with &s;uch awe, that the fir&s;t who approached us crouched &s;o low that he almo&s;t crept upon his hands and knees. It is remarkable that he, like the people in the canoes, pre&s;ented to us the &s;ame &s;ymbol of peace that is known to have been in u&s;e among the ancient and mighty nations of the northern he|mi&s;phere, the green branch of a tree. We received it with looks and ge&s;tures of kindne&s;s and &s;atisfaction; and ob&s;erv|ing that each of them held one in his hand, we immediately gathered every one a bough, and carried it in our hands in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="103">They marched with us about half a mile towards the place where the Dolphin had watered, conducted by Owhaw;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Thur&s;day 13.</NOTE> they then made a full &s;top, and having laid the ground bare, by clearing away all the plants that grew upon it, the principal per&s;ons among them threw their green branches upon the naked &s;pot, and made &s;igns that we &s;hould do the &s;ame; we immediately &s;howed our readine&s;s to comply, and to give a greater &s;olemnity to the rite, the marines were drawn up, and marching in order, each dropped his bough upon tho&s;e of the Indians, and we followed their example. We then proceeded, and when we came to the watering-place it was intimated to us by &s;igns, that we might occupy that ground, but it happened not to be fit for our purpo&s;e. During our walk they had &s;haken off their fir&s;t timid &s;en&s;e of our &s;upe|riority, and were become familiar: they went with us from the watering-place and took a circuit through the woods: as we went along, we di&s;tributed beads and other &s;mall pre|&s;ents among them, and had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee that they were much gratified. Our circuit was not le&s;s than four or five miles, through groves of trees, which were loaded with cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit, and afforded the mo&s;t grateful &s;hade. Under the&s;e trees were the habitations of the people, mo&s;t of them being only a roof without walls, and the whole &s;cene realized the poetical fables of Arcadia. We remarked however, not without &s;ome regret, that in all our walk we had &s;een only two hogs, and not a &s;ingle fowl. Tho&s;e of our company who had been here with the Dolphin told us, that none of the people whom we had yet &s;een were of the fir&s;t cla&s;s; they &s;u&s;pected that the chiefs had removed, and upon carrying us to the place where what they called the Queen's palace had &s;tood, we found that no traces of it were left. We determined therefore to return in the morning, and endea|vour. to find out the <HI>Noble&s;&s;e</HI> in their retreats.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="104"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Friday 14.</NOTE>In the morning, however, before we could leave the &s;hip, &s;everal canoes came about us, mo&s;t of them from the we&s;t|ward, and two of them were filled with people, who by their dre&s;s and deportment appeared to be of a &s;uperior rank: two of the&s;e came on board, and each &s;ingled out his friend; one of them, who&s;e name we found to be MATAHAH, fixed upon Mr. Banks, and the other upon me: this ceremony con&s;i&s;ted in taking off great part of their clothes and putting them upon us. In return for this, we pre&s;ented each of them with a hatcher and &s;ome beads. Soon, after they made &s;igns for us to go with them to the places where they lived, pointing to the S.W.; and as I was de&s;irous of finding a more commodious harbour, and making farther trial of the di&s;|po&s;ition of the people, I con&s;ented.</P>
<P>I ordered out two boats, and with Mr. Banks and Dr. So|lander, the other gentlemen, and our two Indian friends, we embarked for our expedition. After rowing about a league, they made &s;igns that we &s;hould go on &s;hore, and gave us to under&s;tand that this was the place of their re&s;i|dence. We accordingly landed, among &s;everal hundreds of the natives, who conducted us into a hou&s;e of much greater length than any we had &s;een. When we entered, we &s;aw a middle-aged man, who&s;e name we afterwards di&s;covered to be TOOTAHAH; mats were immediately &s;pread, and we were de&s;ired to &s;it down over again&s;t him. Soon after we were &s;eated, he ordered a cock and hen to be brought out, which he pre&s;ented to Mr. Banks and me; we accepted the pre&s;ent, and in a &s;hort time each of us received a piece of cloth, per|fumed after their manner, by no means di&s;agreeably, which they took great pains to make us remark. The piece pre|&s;ented to Mr. Banks was eleven yards long and two wide; in return for which, he gave a laced &s;ilk neckcloth, which he happened to have on, and a linen pocket handkerchief:
<PB N="85" REF="105">
Tootahah immediately dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this new finery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Friday 14.</NOTE> with an air of perfect complacency and &s;atisfaction. But it is now time that I &s;hould take &s;ome notice of the ladies.</P>
<P>Soon after the interchanging of our pre&s;ents with Toota|hah, they attended us to &s;everal large hou&s;es, in which we walked about with great freedom: they &s;hewed us all the civility of which, in our &s;ituation, we could accept; and, on their part, &s;eemed to have no &s;cruple that would have pre|vented its being carried farther. The hou&s;es, which as I have ob&s;erved before, are all open, except a roof, afforded no place of retirement; but the ladies, by frequently point|ing to the mats upon the ground, and &s;ometimes &s;eating them&s;elves and drawing us down upon them, left us no room to doubt of their being much le&s;s jealous of ob&s;erva|tion than we were.</P>
<P>We now took leave of our friendly Chief, and directed our cour&s;e along the &s;hore; when we had walked about a mile, we met, at the head of a great number of people, ano|ther Chief, who&s;e name was TUBOURAI TAMAIDE, with whom we were al&s;o to ratify a treaty of peace, with the ce|remony of which we were now become better acquainted. Having received the branch which he pre&s;ented to us, and given another in return, We laid our hands upon our left brea&s;ts, and pronounced the word <HI>Taio,</HI> which we &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ignify friend; the Chief then gave us to under&s;tand, that if we cho&s;e to eat, he had victuals ready for us. We accepted his offer, and dined very heartily upon fi&s;h, bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts and plantains, dre&s;&s;ed after their manner; they eat &s;ome of their fi&s;h raw, and raw fi&s;h was offered to us, but we declined that part of the entertainment.</P>
<P>During this vi&s;it a wife of our noble ho&s;t, who&s;e name was TOMIO, did Mr. Banks the honour to place her&s;elf upon
<PB N="86" REF="106">
the &s;ame matt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Friday 14.</NOTE> clo&s;e by him. Tomio was not in the fir&s;t bloom of her youth, nor did &s;he appear to have been ever remarkable for her beauty: he did not therefore, I believe, pay her the mo&s;t flattering attention: it happened too, as a farther mortification to this lady, that &s;eeing a very pretty girl among the crowd, he, not adverting to the dignity of his companion, beckoned her to come to him: the girl, after &s;ome entreaty, complied, and &s;at down on the other &s;ide of him; he loaded her with beads, and every &s;howy trifle that would plea&s;e her: his Prince&s;s, though &s;he was &s;omewhat mortified at the preference that was given to her rival, did not di&s;continue her civilities, but &s;till a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;upplied him with the milk of the cocoa-nut, and &s;uch other dainties as were in her reach. This &s;cene might po&s;&s;ibly have be|come more curious and intere&s;ting, if it had not been &s;ud|denly interrupted by an interlude of a more &s;erious kind. Ju&s;t at this time, Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhou&s;e com|plained that their pockets had been picked. Dr. Solander had lo&s;t an opera gla&s;s in a &s;hagreen ca&s;e, and Mr. Monk|hou&s;e his &s;nuff-box. This incident unfortunately put an end to the good-humour of the company. Complaint of the in|jury was made to the Chief; and, to give it weight, Mr. Banks &s;tarted up, and ha&s;tily &s;truck the but end of his fire|lock upon the ground: this action, and the noi&s;e that ac|companied it, &s;truck the whole a&s;&s;embly with a panic, and every one of the natives rap out of the hou&s;e with the ut|mo&s;t precipitation, except the Chief, three women, and two or three others, who appeared by their dre&s;s to be of a &s;upe|rior rank.</P>
<P>The Chief, with a mixture of confu&s;ion and concern, took Mr. Banks by the hand, and led him to a large quantity of cloth, which lay at the other end of the hou&s;e: this he of|fered
<PB N="87" REF="107">
to him piece by piece, intimating by &s;igns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Friday 14.</NOTE> that if that would atone for the wrong which had been done, he might take any part of it, or, if he plea&s;ed, the whole. Mr. Banks put it by, and gave him to under&s;tand, that he wanted no|thing but what had been di&s;hone&s;tly taken away. Toubou|rai Tamaide then went ha&s;tily out, leaving Mr. Banks with his wife Tomio, who during the whole &s;cene of terror and confu&s;ion had kept con&s;tantly at his &s;ide, and intimating his de&s;ire that he &s;hould wait there till his return. Mr. Banks accordingly &s;at down, and conver&s;ed with her, as well as he could by &s;igns, about half an hour. The chief then came back with the &s;nuff-box and the ca&s;e of the opera gla&s;s in his hand, and, with a joy in his countenance that was painted with a &s;trength of expre&s;&s;ion which di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e people from all others, delivered them to the owners. The ca&s;e of the opera gla&s;s, however, upon being opened, was found to be empty; upon this di&s;covery, his countenance changed in a moment; and catching Mr. Banks again by the hand, he ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e, without uttering any &s;ound, and led him along the &s;hore, walking with great rapidity: when they had got about a mile from the hou&s;e, a woman met him and gave him a piece of cloth, which he ha&s;tily took from her, and continued to pre&s;s forward with it in his hand. Dr. Solander and Mr. Monkhou&s;e had followed them, and they came at length to a hou&s;e where they were received by a woman, to whom he gave the cloth, and intimated to the gentlemen that they &s;hould give her &s;ome beads. They immediately complied; and the beads and cloth being depo|&s;ited upon the floor, the woman went out, and in about half an hour returned with the opera gla&s;s, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ame joy upon the occa&s;ion that had before been expre&s;&s;ed by the Chief. The beads were now returned, with an inflexible
<PB N="88" REF="108">
re&s;olution not to accept them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Friday 14.</NOTE> and the cloth was, with with the &s;ame pertinacity, forced upon Dr. Solander, as a recompence for the injury that had been done him. He could not avoid accepting the cloth, but in&s;i&s;ted in his turn upon giving a new pre&s;ent of beads to the woman. It will not perhaps be ea&s;y to account for all the &s;teps that were taken in the recovery of this gla&s;s and &s;nuff-box; but this cannot be thought &s;trange, con&s;idering that the &s;cene of action was among a people who&s;e language, policy and con|nections are even now but imperfectly known; upon the whole, however, they &s;how an intelligence and influence which would do honour to any &s;y&s;tem of government, how|ever regular and improved. In the evening, about &s;ix o'clock, we returned to the &s;hip.</P>

<P>ON the next morning, Saturday the 15th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Saturday 15.</NOTE> &s;everal of the Chiefs whom we had &s;een the day before came on board, and brought with them, hogs, bread-fruit, and other refre&s;hments, for which we gave them hatchets and linen, and &s;uch things as &s;eemed to be mo&s;t acceptable.</P>
<P>As in my excur&s;ion to the we&s;tward, I had not found any more convenient harbour than that in which we lay, I de|termined to go on &s;hore and &s;ix upon &s;ome &s;pot, commanded by the &s;hip's guns, where I might throw up a &s;mall fort for our defence, and prepare for making our a&s;tronomical ob|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>I therefore took a party of men, and landed without delay, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the a&s;trono|mer, Mr. Green. We &s;oon fixed upon a part of the &s;andy beach, on the N. E. point of the bay, which was in every re&s;pect convenient for our purpo&s;e, and not near any habi|tation of the natives. Having marked out the ground that we intended to occupy, a &s;mall tent belonging to Mr. Banks was &s;et up, which had been brought on &s;hore for that pur|po&s;e: by this time a great number of the people had ga|thered about us; but, as it appeared, only to look on, there
<PB N="90" REF="110">
not being a &s;ingle weapon of any kind among them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Saturday 15.</NOTE> I in|timated, however, that none of them were to come within the line I had drawn, except one who appeared to be a chief, and Owhaw. To the&s;e two per&s;ons I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf by &s;igns, and endeavoured to make them under&s;tand, that we wanted the ground which we had marked out to &s;leep upon for a certain number of nights, and that then we &s;hould go away. Whether I was under&s;tood I cannot certainly deter|mine; but the people behaved with a deference and re&s;pect that at once plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed us: they &s;at down peaceably without the circle, and looked on, without giving us any inter|ruption, till we had done, which was upwards of two hours. As we had &s;een no poultry, and but two hogs, in our walk when we were la&s;t on &s;hore at this place, we &s;u&s;pected that, upon our arrival, they had been driven farther up the coun|try; and the rather, as Owhaw was very importunate with us, by &s;igns, not to go into the woods, which, however, and partly for the&s;e rea&s;ons, we were determined to do. Having therefore appointed the thirteen marines and a petty officer to guard the tent, we &s;et out, and a great number of the na|tives joined our party. As we were cro&s;&s;ing a little river that lay in our way we &s;aw &s;ome ducks, and Mr. Banks, as &s;oon as he had got over, fired at them, and happened to kill three at one &s;hot: this &s;truck them with the utmo&s;t terror, &s;o that mo&s;t of them fell &s;uddenly to the ground, as if they al&s;o had been &s;hot at the &s;ame di&s;charge: it was not long, however, before they recovered from their fright, and we continued our rout, but we had not gone far before we were alarmed by the report of two pieces, which were fired by the guard at the tent. We had then &s;traggled a little di&s;tance from each other, but Owhaw immediately called us together, and by waving his hand, &s;ent away every Indian who followed us except three, each of whom, as a pledge of peace on their
<PB N="91" REF="111">
part, and an entreaty that there might be peace on ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Saturday 15.</NOTE> ha&s;tily broke a branch from the trees, and came to us with it in their hands. As we had too much rea&s;on to fear that &s;ome mi&s;chief had happened, we ha&s;ted back to the tent, which was not di&s;tant above half a mile, and when we came up, we found it entirely de&s;erted, except by our own people.</P>
<P>It appeared, that one of the Indians who remained about the tent after we left it, had watched his opportunity, and, taking the centry unawares, had &s;natched away his mu&s;quet. Upon this, the petty officer, a mid&s;hipman, who commanded the party, perhaps from a &s;udden fear of farther violence, perhaps from the natural petulance of power newly acquired, and perhaps from a brutality in his nature, ordered the ma|rines to fire: the men, with as little con&s;ideration or huma|nity as the officer, immediately di&s;charged their pieces among the thicke&s;t of the flying crowd, con&s;i&s;ting of more than a hundred; and ob&s;erving that the thief did not fall, pur&s;ued him, and &s;hot him dead. We afterwards learnt, that none of the others were either killed or wounded.</P>
<P>Owhaw, who had never left us, ob&s;erving that we were now totally de&s;erted, got together a few of tho&s;e who had fled, though not without &s;ome difficulty, and ranged them about us: we endeavoured to ju&s;tify our people as well as we could, and to convince the Indians that if they did no wrong to us, we &s;hould do no wrong to them: they went away without any appearance of di&s;tru&s;t or re&s;entment; and having &s;truck our tent, we returned to the &s;hip, but by no means &s;atisfied with the tran&s;actions of the day.</P>
<P>Upon que&s;tioning our people more particularly, who&s;e conduct they &s;oon perceived we could not approve, they al|leged that the centinel who&s;e mu&s;quet was taken away, was violently a&s;&s;aulted and thrown down, and that a pu&s;h

was afterwards made at him by the man who took the mu&s;|quet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Saturday 15.</NOTE> before any command was given to fire. It was al&s;o &s;ugge&s;ted, that Owhaw had &s;u&s;picions, at lea&s;t, if not cer|tain knowlege, that &s;omething would be attempted again&s;t our people at the tent, which made him &s;o very earne&s;t in his endeavours to prevent our leaving it; others imputed his importunity to his de&s;ire that we &s;hould confine our&s;elves to the beach: and it was remarked that neither Owhaw, nor the Chiefs who remained with us after he had &s;ent the re&s;t of the people away, would have inferred the breach of peace from the firing at the tent, if they had had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome injury had been offered by their coun|trymen; e&s;pecially as Mr. Banks had ju&s;t fired at the ducks: and yet that they did infer a breach of peace from that inci|dent, as was manife&s;t from their waving their hands for the people to di&s;per&s;e, and in&s;tantly pulling green branches from the trees. But what were the real circum&s;tances of this un|happy affair, and whether either and which of the&s;e conjec|tures were true, can never certainly be known.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 16.</NOTE>The next morning but few of the natives were &s;een upon the beach, and not one of them came off to the &s;hip. This convinced us that our endeavours to quiet their apprehen&s;ions had not been effectual; and we remarked with particular regret, that we were de&s;erted even by Owhaw, who had hi|therto been &s;o con&s;tant in his attachment, and &s;o active in renewing the peace that had been broken.</P>
<P>Appearances being thus unfavourable, I warped the &s;hip nearer to the &s;hore, and moored her in &s;uch a manner as to command all the N.E. part of the bay, particularly the place which I had marked out for the building a fort. In the even|ing, however, I went on &s;hore with only a boat's crew, and &s;ome of the Gentlemen: the natives gathered about us, but
<PB N="93" REF="115">
not in the &s;ame number as before;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April.</NOTE> there were I believe be|tween thirty and forty, and they trafficked with us for cocoa-nuts and other fruit, to all appearance as friendly as ever.</P>
<P>On the 17th, early in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 17.</NOTE> we had the misfortune to lo&s;e Mr. Buchan, the per&s;on whom Mr. Banks had brought out as a painter of land&s;capes and figures. He was a &s;ober, diligent, and ingenious young man, and greatly regretted by Mr. Banks; who hoped, by his means, to have gratified his friends in England with repre&s;entations of this country and its inhabitants, which no other per&s;on on board could delineate with the &s;ame accuracy and elegance. He had al|ways been &s;ubject to epileptic fits, one of which &s;eized him on the mountains of Terra del Fuego, and this di&s;order being aggravated by a bilious complaint which he contracted on board the &s;hip, at length put an end to his life. It was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed to bury him on &s;hore, but Mr. Banks thinking, that it might perhaps give offence to the natives, with who&s;e cu&s;toms we were then wholly unacquainted, we committed his body to the &s;ea, with as much decency and &s;olemnity as our circum&s;tances and &s;ituation would admit.</P>
<P>In the forenoon of this day we received a vi&s;it from Tu|bourai Tamaide and Tootahah, our Chiefs, from the We&s;t: they brought with them, as emblems of peace, not branches of plantain, but two young trees, and would not venture on board till the&s;e had been received, having probably been alarmed by the mischief which had been done at the tent. Each of them al&s;o brought, as propitiatory gifts, &s;ome bread-fruit, and a hog ready dre&s;&s;ed: this was a mo&s;t acceptable pre&s;ent, as we perceived that hogs were not always to be got; and in return we gave to each of our noble benefactors a hatchet and a nail. In the evening we went on &s;hore and &s;et up a tent, in which Mr. Green and my&s;elf &s;pent the night,
<PB N="94" REF="116">
in order to ob&s;erve an eclip&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;atellite of Jupiter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April.</NOTE> but the weather becoming cloudy, we were di&s;appointed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 18.</NOTE>On the 18th, at day-break, I went on &s;hore, with as many people as could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared from the &s;hip, and began to erect our fort. While &s;ome were employed in throwing up intrenchments, others were bu&s;y in cutting pickets and fa&s;cines, which the natives, who &s;oon gathered round us as they had been u&s;ed to do, were &s;o far from hindering, that many of them voluntarily a&s;&s;i&s;ted us, bringing the pickets and fa&s;cines from the wood where they had been cut, with great alacrity: we had indeed been &s;o &s;crupulous of in|vading their property, that we purcha&s;ed every &s;take which was u&s;ed upon this occa&s;ion, and cut down no tree till we had fir&s;t obtained their con&s;ent. The &s;oil where we con|&s;tructed our fort was &s;andy, and this made it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen the intrenchments with wood; three &s;ides were to be fortified in this manner; the fourth was bounded by a river, upon the banks of which I propo&s;ed to place a proper number of water-ca&s;ks. This day we &s;erved pork to the &s;hip's company for the fir&s;t time, and the Indians brought down &s;o much bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, that we found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end away part of them unbought, and to ac|quaint them, by &s;igns, that we &s;hould want no more for two days to come. Every thing was purcha&s;ed this day with beads: a &s;ingle bead, as big as a pea, being the purcha&s;e of five or &s;ix cocoa-nuts, and as many of the bread-fruit. Mr. Banks's tent was got up before night within the works, and he &s;lept on &s;hore for the fir&s;t time. Proper centries were placed round it, but no Indian attempted to approach it the whole night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE>The next morning, our friend Tubourai Tamaide made Mr. Banks a vi&s;it at the tent, and brought with him not
<PB N="95" REF="117">
only his wife and family, but the roof of a hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> and &s;everal materials for &s;etting it up, with furniture and im|plements of various kinds, intending, as we under&s;tood him, to take up his re&s;idence in our neighbourhood: this in&s;tance of his confidence and good-will gave us great plea&s;ure, and we determined to &s;trengthen his attachment to us by every means in our power. Soon after his arrival, he took Mr. Banks by the hand, and leading him out of the line, &s;igni|fied that he &s;hould accompany him into the woods. Mr. Banks readily con&s;ented, and having walked with him about a quarter of a mile, they arrived at a kind of awning which he had already &s;et up, and which &s;eemed to be his occa&s;ional habitation. Here he unfolded a bundle of his country cloth, and taking out two garments, one of red cloth, and the other of very neat matting, he clothed Mr. Banks in them, and without any other ceremony, immediately con|ducted him back to the tent. His attendants &s;oon after brought him &s;ome pork and bread-fruit, which he eat, dip|ping his meat into &s;alt water in&s;tead of &s;auce: after his meal he retired to Mr. Banks's bed, and &s;lept about an hour. In the afternoon, his wife Tomio brought to the tent a young man about two and twenty years of age, of a very comely appearance, whom they both &s;eemed to acknowledge as their &s;on, though we afterwards di&s;covered that he was not &s;o. In the evening, this young man and another Chief, who had al&s;o paid us a vi&s;it, went away to the we&s;tward, but Tubourai Tamaide and his wife returned to the awning in the &s;kirts of the wood.</P>
<P>Our Surgeon, Mr. Monkhou&s;e, having walked out this evening, reported, that he had &s;een the body of the man who had been &s;hot at the tents, which he &s;aid was wrapped in cloth, and placed on a kind of bier, &s;upported by &s;takes, under a roof that &s;eemed to have been &s;et up for the pur|po&s;e:
<PB N="96" REF="118">
that near it were depo&s;ited &s;ome in&s;trument of war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> and other things, which he would particularly have ex|amined but for the &s;tench of the body, which was into|lerable. He &s;aid, that he &s;aw al&s;o two more &s;heds of the &s;ame kind, in one of which were the bones of a human body that had lain till they were quite dry. We di&s;covered afterwards, that this was the way in which they u&s;ually di&s;|po&s;ed of their dead.</P>
<P>A kind of market now began to be kept ju&s;t without the lines, and was plentifully &s;upplied with every thing but pork. Tubourai Tamaide was our con&s;tant gue&s;t, imitat|ing our manners, even to the u&s;ing of a knife and fork, which he did very handily.</P>
<P>As my curio&s;ity was excited by Mr. Monkhou&s;e's account of the &s;ituation of the man who had been &s;hot, I took an op|portunity to go with &s;ome others to &s;ee it. I found the &s;hed under which his body lay, clo&s;e by the hou&s;e in which he re&s;ided when he was alive, &s;ome others being not more than ten yards di&s;tant; it was about 15 feet long, and 11 broad, and of a proportionable height: one end was wholly open, and the other end, and the two &s;ides, were partly enclo&s;ed with a kind of wicker work. The bier on which the corps was depo&s;ited, was a frame of wood like that in which the &s;ea beds, called cotts, are placed, with a matted bottom, and &s;upported by four po&s;ts, at the height of about five feet from the ground. The body was covered fir&s;t with a matt, and then with white cloth; by the &s;ide of it lay a wooden mace, one of their weapons of war, and near the head of it, which lay next to the clo&s;e end of the &s;hed, lay two cocoa nut-&s;hells, &s;uch as are &s;ometimes u&s;ed to carry water in; at the other end a bunch of green leaves, with &s;ome dried twigs, all tied together, were &s;tuck in the ground, by which lay a &s;tone
<PB N="97" REF="119">
about as big as a cocoa-nut:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> near the&s;e lay one of the young plantain trees, which are u&s;ed for emblems of peace, and clo&s;e by it a &s;tone ax. At the open end of the &s;hed al&s;o hung, in &s;everal &s;trings, a great number of palm-nuts, and with|out the &s;hed, was &s;tuck upright in the ground, the &s;tem of a plantain tree about five feet high, upon the top of which was placed a cocoa nut-&s;hell full of fre&s;h water: again&s;t the &s;ide of one of the po&s;ts hung a &s;mall bag, containing a few pieces of bread-fruit ready roa&s;ted, which were not all put in at the &s;ame time, for &s;ome of them were fre&s;h, and others &s;tale. I took notice that &s;everal of the natives ob&s;erved us with a mixture of &s;olicitude and jealou&s;y in their counte|nances, and by their ge&s;tures expre&s;&s;ed unea&s;ine&s;s when we went near the body, &s;tanding them&s;elves at a little di&s;tance while we were making our examination, and appearing to be plea&s;ed when we came away.</P>
<P>Our re&s;idence on more would by no means have been di&s;|agreeable if we had not been ince&s;&s;antly tormented by the flies, which, among other mi&s;chief, made it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for Mr. Parkin&s;on, Mr. Banks's natural hi&s;tory painter, to work; for they not only covered his &s;ubject &s;o as that no part of its &s;urface could be &s;een, but even eat the colour off the paper as fa&s;t as he could lay it on. We had re|cour&s;e to mu&s;quito nets and fly-traps, which, though they made the inconvenience tolerable, were very far from re|moving it.</P>
<P>On the 22d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 22.</NOTE> Tootahah gave us a &s;pecimen of the mu&s;ic of this country; four per&s;ons performed upon flutes which had only two &s;tops, and therefore could not &s;ound more than four notes, by half tones: they were &s;ounded like our Ger|man flutes, except that the performer, in&s;tead of applying it
<PB N="98" REF="120">
to his mouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Saturday 22.</NOTE> blew into it with one no&s;tril, while he &s;topped the other with his thumb: to the&s;e in&s;truments four other per&s;ons &s;ung, and kept very good time; but only one tune was played during the whole concert.</P>
<P>Several of the natives brought us axes, which they had received from on board the Dolphin, to grind and repair; but among others, there was one which became the &s;ubject of much &s;peculation, as it appeared to be French: after much enquiry, we learnt that a &s;hip had been here be|tween our arrival and the departure of the Dolphin, which we then conjectured to have been a Spaniard, but now know to have been the Boudeu&s;e, commanded by M. Bou|gainville.</P>

<P>ON the 24th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Monday 24.</NOTE> Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander examined the country for &s;everal miles along the &s;hore to the ea&s;t|ward: for about two miles it was flat and fertile; after that the hills &s;tretched quite to the water's edge, and a little far|ther ran out into the &s;ea, &s;o that they were obliged to climb over them. The&s;e hills, which were barren, continued for about three miles more, and then terminated in a large plain, which was full of good hou&s;es, and people who appeared to live in great affluence. In this place there was a river, much more con&s;iderable than that at our fort, which i&s;&s;ued from a deep and beautiful valley, and, where our travellers cro&s;&s;ed it, though at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea, was near one hun|dred yards wide. About a mile beyond this river the country became again barren, the rocks every where projecting into the &s;ea, for which rea&s;on they re&s;olved to return. Ju&s;t as they had formed this re&s;olution, one of the natives offered them refre&s;hment, which they accepted. They found this man to be of a kind that has been de&s;cribed by various au|thors, as mixed with many nations, but di&s;tinct from them all. His &s;kin was of a dead white, without the lea&s;t appear|ance of what is called complexion, though &s;ome parts of his
<PB N="100" REF="122">
body were in a &s;mall degree le&s;s white than others:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Monday 24.</NOTE> his hair, eye-brows, and beard were as white as his &s;kin; his eyes appeared as if they were blood&s;hot, and he &s;eemed to be very &s;hort-&s;ighted.</P>
<P>At their return they were met by Tubourai Tamaide, and his women, who, at &s;eeing them, felt a joy which not being able to expre&s;s, they bur&s;t into tears, and wept &s;ome time before their pa&s;&s;ion could be re&s;trained.</P>
<P>This evening Dr. Solander lent his knife to one of the&s;e women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 25.</NOTE> who neglected to return it, and the next morning Mr. Banks's al&s;o was mi&s;&s;ing; upon this occa&s;ion I mu&s;t bear my te&s;timony, that the people of this country, of all ranks, men and women, are the errante&s;t thieves upon the face of the earth: the very day after we arrived here, when they came on board us, the chiefs were employed in &s;tealing what they could in the cabbin, and their dependants were no le&s;s indu&s;trious in other parts of the &s;hip; they &s;natched up every thing that it was po&s;&s;ible for them to &s;ecrete till they got on &s;hore, even to the gla&s;s ports, two of which they carried off undetected. Tubourai Tamaide was the only one except Tootahah who had not been found guilty, and the pre&s;umption, ari&s;ing from this circum&s;tance, that he was exempt from a vice, of which the whole nation be|&s;ides were guilty, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to outweigh &s;trong ap|pearances to the contrary. Mr. Banks therefore, though not without &s;ome reluctance, accu&s;ed him of having &s;tolen his knife: he &s;olemnly and &s;teadily denied that he knew any thing of it; upon which Mr. Banks made him under&s;tand, that whoever had taken it, he was determined to have it re|turned: upon this re&s;olute declaration, one of the natives who was pre&s;ent, produced a rag in which three knives were very carefully tied up. One was that which Dr. Solander
<PB N="101" REF="123">
had lent to the woman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Tue&s;day 25.</NOTE> another was a table knife belonging to me, and the owner of the third was not known. With the&s;e the chief immediately &s;et out, in order to make re&s;ti|tution of them to their owners at the tents. Mr. Banks re|mained with the women, who expre&s;&s;ed great apprehen&s;ions that &s;ome mi&s;chief was de&s;igned again&s;t their lord. When he came to the tents he re&s;tored one of the knives to Dr. So|lander and another to me, the third not being owned, and then began to &s;earch for Mr. Banks's in all the places where he had ever &s;een it. After &s;ome time, one of Mr. Banks's &s;ervants, under&s;tanding what he was about, immediately fetched his ma&s;ter's knife, which it &s;eems he had laid by the day before, and till now knew nothing of its having been mi&s;&s;ed. Tubourai Tamaide, upon this demon&s;tration of his inno|cence, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of mind, both in his looks and ge&s;tures; the tears &s;tarted from his eyes, and he made &s;igns, with the knife, that, if he was ever guilty of &s;uch an action as had been imputed to him, he would &s;ub|mit to have his throat cut. He then ru&s;hed out of the lines, and returned ha&s;tily to Mr. Banks, with a countenance that &s;everely reproached him with his &s;u&s;picions. Mr. Banks &s;oon under&s;tood that the knife had been received from his &s;ervant, and was &s;carcely le&s;s affected at what had happened than the Chief; he felt him&s;elf to be the guilty per&s;on, and was very de&s;irous to atone for his fault. The poor Indian, however violent his pa&s;&s;ions, was a &s;tranger to &s;ullen re&s;ent|ment; and upon Mr. Banks's &s;pending a little time fami|liarly with him, and making him a few trifling pre&s;ents, he forgot the wrong that had been done him, and was per|fectly reconciled.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion it may be ob&s;erved, that the&s;e people have a knowlege of right and wrong from the mere dictates of natural con&s;cience; and involuntarily condemn them|&s;elves
<PB N="102" REF="124">
when they do that to others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Tue&s;day 25.</NOTE> which they would con|demn others for doing to them. That Tubourai Tamaide felt the force of moral obligation, is certain; for the imputa|tion of an action which he con&s;idered as indifferent, would not, when it appeared to be groundle&s;s, have moved him with &s;uch exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion. We mu&s;t indeed e&s;timate the virtue of the&s;e people, by the only &s;tandard of morality, the conformity of their conduct to what in their opinion as right; but we mu&s;t not ha&s;tily conclude that theft is a te&s;timony of the &s;ame depravity in them that it is in us, in the in&s;tances in which our people were &s;ufferers by their di&s;hone&s;ty; for their temptation was &s;uch, as to &s;urmount would be con&s;i|dered as a proof of uncommon integrity among tho&s;e who have more knowlege, better principles, and &s;tronger motives to re&s;i&s;t the temptations of illicit advantage: an Indian among penny knives, and beads, or even nails and broken gla&s;s, is in the &s;ame &s;tate of trial with the meane&s;t &s;ervant in Europe among unlocked coffers of jewels and gold.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 26.</NOTE>On the 26th, I mounted &s;ix &s;wivel guns upon the fort, which I was &s;orry to &s;ee &s;truck the natives with dread: &s;ome fi&s;hermen who lived upon the point removed farther off, and Owhaw told us, by &s;igns, that in four days we &s;hould fire great guns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 27.</NOTE>On the 27th, Tubourai Tamaide, with a friend, who eat with a voracity that I never &s;aw before, and the three wo|men that u&s;ually attended him, who&s;e names were TERAPO, TIRAO, and OMIE, dined at the fort: in the evening they took their leave, and &s;et out for the hou&s;e which Tubourai Tamaide had &s;et up in the &s;kirts of the wood; but in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour he returned in great emotion, and ha&s;tily &s;eizing Mr. Banks's arm, made &s;igns that he &s;hould follow him. Mr. Banks immediately complied, and
<PB N="103" REF="125">
they &s;oon came up to a place where they found the &s;hip's butcher, with a reaping-hook in his hand:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Thur&s;day 27.</NOTE> here the Chief &s;topped, and, in a tran&s;port of rage which rendered his &s;igns &s;carcely intelligible, intimated that the butcher had threat|ened, or attempted, to cut his wife's throat with the reaping-hook. Mr. Banks then &s;ignified to him, that if he could fully explain the offence, the man &s;hould be puni&s;hed. Upon this he became more calm, and made Mr. Banks under&s;tand that the offender, having taken a fancy to a &s;tone hatchet which lay in his hou&s;e, had offered to purcha&s;e it of his wife for a nail: that &s;he having refu&s;ed to part with it upon any terms, he had catched it up, and throwing down the nail, threatened to cut her throat if &s;he made any re&s;i&s;tance: to prove this charge the hatchet and the nail were produced, and the butcher had &s;o little to &s;ay in his defence that there was not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to doubt of its truth.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks having reported this matter to me, I took an opportunity, when the Chief and his women, with other In|dians, were on board the &s;hip, to call up the butcher, and after a recapitulation of the charge and the proof, I gave orders that he &s;hould be puni&s;hed, as well to prevent other offences of the &s;ame kind, as to acquit Mr. Banks of his pro|mi&s;e; the Indians &s;aw him &s;tripped and tied up to the rig|ging with a fixed attention, waiting in &s;ilent &s;u&s;pence for the event; but as &s;oon as the fir&s;t &s;troke was given, they inter|fered with great agitation, earne&s;tly intreating that the re&s;t of the puni&s;hment might be remitted: to this, however, for many rea&s;ons, I could not con&s;ent, and when they found that they could not prevail by their interce&s;&s;ion, they gave vent to their pity by tears.</P>
<P>Their tears indeed, like tho&s;e of children, were always ready to expre&s;s any pa&s;&s;ion that was &s;trongly excited, and

like tho&s;e of children they al&s;o appeared to be forgotten as &s;oon as &s;hed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Friday 28.</NOTE> of which the following among many others, is a remarkable in&s;tance. Very early in the morning of the 28th, even before it was day, a great number of them came down to the fort, and Terapo being ob&s;erved among the wo|men on the out&s;ide of the gate, Mr. Banks went out and brought her in; he &s;aw that the tears then &s;tood in her eyes, and as &s;oon as &s;he entered they began to flow in great abun|dance: he enquired earne&s;tly the cau&s;e, but in&s;tead of an&s;wer|ing &s;he took from under her garment a &s;hark's tooth, and &s;truck it &s;ix or &s;even times into her head with great force; a profu&s;ion of blood followed, and &s;he talked loud, but in a mo&s;t melancholy tone, for &s;ome minutes, without at all re|garding his enquiries, which he repeated with &s;till more im|patience and concern, while the other Indians, to his great &s;urprize, talked and laughed, without taking the lea&s;t no|tice of her di&s;tre&s;s. But her own behaviour was &s;till more extraordinary. As &s;oon as the bleeding was over, &s;he looked up with a &s;mile, and began to collect &s;ome &s;mall pieces of cloth, which during her bleeding &s;he had thrown down to catch the blood; as &s;oon as &s;he had picked them all up, &s;he carried them out of the tent, and threw them into the &s;ea, carefully di&s;per&s;ing them abroad, as if &s;he wi&s;hed to prevent the &s;ight of them from reviving the remembrance of what &s;he had done. She then plunged into the river, and after having wa&s;hed her whole body, returned to the tents with the &s;ame gaiety and cheerfulne&s;s as if nothing had hap|pened.</P>
<P>It is not indeed &s;trange that the &s;orrows of the&s;e artle&s;s people &s;hould be tran&s;ient, any more than that their pa&s;&s;ions &s;hould be &s;uddenly and &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed: what they feel they have never been taught either to di&s;gui&s;e or &s;uppre&s;s, and having no habits of thinking which perpetually recal

Yet if we admit that they are upon the whole happier than we, we mu&s;t admit that the child is happier than the man, and that we are lo&s;ers by the perfection of our nature, the increa&s;e of our knowlege, and the enlargement of our views.</P>
<P>Canoes were continually coming in during all this fore|noon, and the tents at the fort were crowded with people of both &s;exes from different parts of the I&s;land. I was my&s;elf bu&s;y on board the &s;hip, but Mr. Mollineux, our ma&s;ter, who was one of tho&s;e that made the la&s;t voyage in the Dolphin, went on &s;hore. As &s;oon as he entered Mr. Banks's tent he fixed his eyes upon one of the women, who was &s;itting there with great compo&s;ure among the re&s;t, and immediately de|clared her to be the per&s;on who at that time was &s;uppo&s;ed to be Queen of the i&s;land; &s;he al&s;o, at the &s;ame time, acknow|ledging him to be one of the &s;trangers whom &s;he had &s;een before. The attention of all pre&s;ent was now diverted from every other object, and wholly engaged in con&s;idering a per|&s;on who had made &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a figure in the accounts that had been given of this i&s;land by its fir&s;t di&s;coverers; and we &s;oon learnt that her name was OBEREA. She &s;eemed to be about forty years of age, and was not only tall, but of a large make; her &s;kin was white, and there was an un|common intelligence and &s;en&s;ibility in her eyes: &s;he ap|peared to have been hand&s;ome when &s;he was young, but at this time little more than memorials of her beauty were left.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="128"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Friday 28.</NOTE>As &s;oon as her quality was known, an offer was made to conduct her to the &s;hip. Of this &s;he readily accepted, and came on board with two men and &s;everal women, who &s;eemed to be all of her family; I received her with &s;uch marks of di&s;tinction as I thought would gratify her mo&s;t, and was not &s;paring of my pre&s;ents, among which this au|gu&s;t per&s;onage &s;eemed particularly delighted with a child's doll. After &s;ome time &s;pent on board, I attended her back to the &s;hore; and as &s;oon as we landed, &s;he pre&s;ented me with a hog, and &s;everal bunches of plantains, which &s;he cau&s;ed to be carried from her canoes up to the fort in a kind of proce&s;&s;ion, of which &s;he and my&s;elf brought up the rear. In our way to the fort we met Tootahah, who, though not King, appeared to be at this time inve&s;ted with the &s;overeign authority; he &s;eemed not to be well plea&s;ed with the di&s;|tinction that was &s;hewed to the lady, and became &s;o jealous when &s;he produced her doll, that to propitiate him it was thought proper to compliment him with another. At this time he thought fit to prefer a doll to a hatchet; but this preference aro&s;e only from a childi&s;h jealou&s;y, which could not be &s;oothed but by a gift of exactly the &s;ame kind with that which had been pre&s;ented to Oberea; for dolls in a very &s;hort time were univer&s;ally con&s;idered as trifles of no value.</P>
<P>The men who had vi&s;ited us from time to time had, with|out &s;cruple, eaten of our provi&s;ions; but the women had never yet been prevailed upon to ta&s;te a mor&s;el. To-day, however, though they refu&s;ed the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations to dine with the Gentlemen, they afterwards retired to the &s;ervants apartment, and eat of plantains very heartily; a my&s;tery of female oeconomy here, which none of us could explain.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="129">On the 29th, not very early in the forenoon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. April. Saturday 29.</NOTE> Mr. Banks went to pay his court to Oberea, and was told that &s;he was &s;till a&s;leep under the awning of her canoe: thither therefore he went, intending to call her up, a liberty which he thought he might take, without any danger of giving offence: but, upon looking into her chamber, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, he found her in bed with a hand&s;ome young fellow about five and twenty, who&s;e name was OBAD&Eacute;E: he retreated with &s;ome ha&s;te and confu&s;ion, but was &s;oon made to under&s;tand, that &s;uch amours gave no occa&s;ion to &s;candal, and that Oba|d&eacute;e was univer&s;ally known to have been &s;elected by her as the object of her private favours. The lady being too polite to &s;uffer Mr. Banks to wait long in her antichamber, dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with more than u&s;ual expedition, and as a token of of &s;pecial grace, clothed him in a &s;uit of fine cloth and pro|ceeded with him to the tents. In the evening, Mr. Banks paid a vi&s;it to Tubourai Tamaide, as he had often done be|fore, by candle light, and was equally grieved and &s;urprized to find him and his family in a melancholy mood, and mo&s;t of them in tears: he endeavoured in vain to di&s;cover the cau&s;e, and therefore his &s;tay among them was but &s;hort. When he reported this circum&s;tance to the officers at the fort, they recollected that Owhaw had foretold, that in four days we &s;hould fire our great guns; and as this was the eve of the third day, the &s;ituation in which Tubourai Tamaide and his family had been found, alarmed them. The &s;entries therefore were doubled at the fort, and the Gentlemen &s;lept under arms; at two in the morning, Mr. Banks him&s;elf went round the point, but found every thing &s;o quiet, that he gave up all &s;u&s;picions of mi&s;chief intended by the natives as groundle&s;s. We had however another &s;ource of &s;ecurity; our little fortification was now complete. The north and

Our garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about five and forty men with &s;mall arms, including the officers, and the gentlemen who re&s;ided on &s;hore; and our &s;entries were as well relieved as in the be&s;t regulated frontier in Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 30.</NOTE>We continued our vigilance the next day, though we had no particular rea&s;on to think it nece&s;&s;ary; but about ten o'clock in the morning, Tomio came running to the tents, with a mixture of grief and fear in her countenance, and taking Mr. Banks, to whom they applied in every emer|gency and di&s;tre&s;s, by the arm, intimated that Tubourai Tamaide was dying, in con&s;equence of &s;omething which our people had given him to eat, and that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly go with her to his hou&s;e. Mr. Banks &s;et out without delay, and found his Indian friend leaning his head again&s;t a po&s;t, in an attitude of the utmo&s;t languor and de&s;pondency; the people about him intimated that he had been vomiting, and brought out a leaf folded up with great care, which they &s;aid contained &s;ome of the poi&s;on, by the deleterious effects of which he was now dying. Mr. Banks ha&s;tily opened the leaf, and upon examining its contents found them to be no other than a chew of tobacco, which the chief had begged of &s;ome of our people, and which they had indi&s;creetly given

During the examination of the leaf and its contents, he looked up at Mr. Banks with the mo&s;t piteous a&s;pect, and intimated that he had but a very &s;hort time to live. Mr. Banks, however, being now ma&s;ter of his di&s;ea&s;e, directed him to drink plentifully of cocoa-nut milk, which in a &s;hort time put an end to his &s;ickne&s;s and apprehen&s;ions, and he &s;pent the day at the fort with that uncommon flow of cheerfulne&s;s and good-humour, which is always produced by a &s;udden and unexpected relief from pain either of body or mind.</P>

<P>IN the afternoon, of Monday the 1&s;t of May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Monday 1.</NOTE> we &s;et up the ob&s;ervatory, and took the a&s;tronomical quadrant, with &s;ome other in&s;truments on &s;hore, for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>The next morning, about nine o'clock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 2.</NOTE> I went on &s;hore with Mr. Green to fix the quadrant in a &s;ituation for u&s;e, when to our inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;urprize and concern it was not to be found. It had been depo&s;ited in the tent which was re|&s;erved for my u&s;e, where, as I pa&s;&s;ed the night on board, nobody &s;lept: it had never been taken out of the packing-ca&s;e, which was eighteen inches &s;quare, and the whole was of con&s;iderable weight; a &s;entinel had been po&s;ted the whole night within five yards of the tent door, and none of the other in&s;truments were mi&s;&s;ing. We at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected that it might have been &s;tolen by &s;ome of our own people, who &s;eeing a deal box, and not knowing the contents, might think it contained nails, or &s;ome other &s;ubjects of traffic with the natives. A large reward was therefore offered to any one who could find it, as, without this, we could not perform the &s;ervice for which our voyage was principally undertaken. Our &s;earch in the mean time was not confined to the fort and the places adjacent, but as the ca&s;e might po&s;&s;ibly have been carried back to the &s;hip, if any of our
<PB N="112" REF="134">
own people had been the thieves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Tue&s;day. 2.</NOTE> the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch was made for it on board; all the parties however returned without any news of the quadrant. Mr. Banks, therefore, who upon &s;uch occa&s;ions declined neither labour nor ri&s;k, and who had more influence over the Indians than any of us, determined to go in &s;earch of it into the woods; he hoped, that if it had been &s;tolen by the natives, he &s;hould find it wherever they had opened the box, as they would immediately di&s;cover that to them it would be wholly u&s;e|le&s;s: or, if in this expectation he &s;hould be di&s;appointed, that he might recover it by the a&s;cendancy he had acquired over the Chiefs. He &s;et out, accompanied by a mid&s;hipman and Mr. Green, and as he was cro&s;&s;ing the river he was met by Tubourai Tamaide, who immediately made the figure of a triangle with three bits of &s;traw upon his hand. By this Mr. Banks knew that the Indians were the thieves; and that, although they had opened the ca&s;e, they were not di&s;po&s;ed to part with the contents. No time was therefore to be lo&s;t, and Mr. Banks made Tubourai Tamaide under&s;tand, that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly go with him to the place whither the qua|drant had been carried; he con&s;ented, and they &s;et out to|gether to the ea&s;tward, the Chief inquiring at every hou&s;e which they pa&s;&s;ed after the thief by name: the people rea|dily told him which way he was gone, and how long it was &s;ince he had been there: the hope which this gave them that they &s;hould overtake him, &s;upported them under their fatigue, and they pre&s;&s;ed forward, &s;ometimes walking, &s;ometimes running, though the weather was intolerably hot; when they had climbed a hill at the di&s;tance of about four miles, their conductor &s;hewed them a point full three miles far|ther, and gave them to under&s;tand that they were not to ex|pect the in&s;trument till they had got thither. Here they pau&s;ed; they had no arms, except a pair of pi&s;tols, which
<PB N="113" REF="135">
Mr. Banks always carried in his pocket;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Tue&s;day 2.</NOTE> they were going to a place that was at lea&s;t &s;even miles di&s;tant from the fort, where the Indians might be le&s;s &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive than at home, and to take from them what they had ventured their lives to get; and what, notwith&s;tanding our conjectures, they ap|peared de&s;irous to keep: the&s;e were di&s;couraging circum|&s;tances, and their &s;ituation would become more critical at every &s;tep. They determined, however, not to relinqui&s;h their enterprize, nor to pur&s;ue it without taking the be&s;t mea&s;ures for their &s;ecurity that were in their power. It was therefore determined, that Mr. Banks and Mr. Green &s;hould go on, and that the Mid&s;hipman &s;hould return to me, and de&s;ire that I would &s;end a party of men after them, acquaint|ing me at the &s;ame time, that it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould return till it was dark. Upon receiving this me&s;&s;age I &s;et out, with &s;uch a party as I thought &s;ufficient for the occa&s;ion; leaving orders, both at the &s;hip and at the fort, that no ca|noe &s;hould be &s;uffered to go out of the bay, but that none of the natives &s;hould be &s;eized or detained.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Mr. Banks and Mr. Green pur&s;ued their journey, under the au&s;pices of Tubourai Tamaide, and in the very &s;pot which he had &s;pecified, they met one of his own people, with part of the quadrant in his hand. At this mo&s;t welcome &s;ight they &s;topped; and a great number of Indians immediately came up, &s;ome of whom pre&s;&s;ing rather rudely upon them, Mr. Banks thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew one of his pi&s;tols, the &s;ight of which reduced them in&s;tantly to or|der: as the crowd that gathered round them was every mo|ment increa&s;ing, he marked out a circle in the gra&s;s, and they ranged them&s;elves on the out&s;ide of it to the number of &s;everal hundreds with great quietne&s;s and decorum. Into the middle of this circle, the box, which was now arrived, was ordered to be brought, with &s;everal reading gla&s;&s;es, and
<PB N="114" REF="136">
other &s;mall matters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Tue&s;day 2.</NOTE> which in their hurry they had put into a pi&s;tol-ca&s;e, that Mr. Banks knew to be his property, it hav|ing been &s;ome time before &s;tolen from the tents, with a hor&s;e pi&s;tol in it, which he immediately demanded, and which was al&s;o re&s;tored.</P>
<P>Mr. Green was impatient to &s;ee whether all that had been taken away was returned, and upon examining the box found the &s;tand, and a few &s;mall things of le&s;s con&s;equence, wanting; &s;everal per&s;ons were &s;ent in &s;earch of the&s;e, and mo&s;t of the &s;mall things were returned: but it was &s;ignified that the thief had not brought the &s;tand &s;o far, and that it would be delivered to our friends as they went back; this being confirmed by Tubourai Tamaide, they prepared to re|turn, as nothing would then be wanting but what might ea&s;ily be &s;upplied; and after they had advanced about two miles, I met them with my party, to our mutual &s;atisfaction, congratulating each other upon the recovery of the qua|drant, with a plea&s;ure proportioned to the importance of the event.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock, Mr. Banks with Tubourai Tamaide got back to the fort; when, to his great &s;urprize, he found Tootahah in cu&s;tody, and many of the natives in the utmo&s;t terror and di&s;tre&s;s, crowding about the gate. He went ha&s;|tily in, &s;ome of the Indians were &s;uffered to follow him, and the &s;cene was extremely affecting. Tubourai Tamaide pre&s;&s;ing forward, ran up to Tootahah, and catching him in his arms, they both bur&s;t into tears, and wept over each other, without being able to &s;peak: the other Indians were al&s;o in tears for their Chief, both he and they being &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the notion that he was to be put to death. In this &s;ituation they continued till I entered the fort, which was about a quarter of an hour afterwards. I was equally
<PB N="115" REF="137">
&s;urprized and concerned at what had happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Tue&s;day 2.</NOTE> the con|fining Tootahah being contrary to my orders, and therefore in&s;tantly &s;et him at liberty. Upon enquiring into the affair, I was told, that my going into the woods with a party of men under arms, at a time when a robbery had been committed, which it was &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;hould re&s;ent, in proportion to our apparent injury by the lo&s;s, had &s;o alarmed the natives, that in the evening they began to leave the neighbourhood of the fort with their effects: that a double canoe having been &s;een to put off from the bottom of the bay by Mr. Gore, the Se|cond Lieutenant, who was left in command on board the &s;hip, and who had received orders not to &s;uffer any canoe to go out, he &s;ent the Boat&s;wain with a boat after her to bring her back: that as &s;oon as the boat came up, the Indians, being alarmed, leaped into the &s;ea; and that Tootahah, being unfortunately one of the number, the Boat&s;wain took him up, and brought him to the &s;hip, &s;uffering the re&s;t of the people to &s;wim on &s;hore: that Mr. Gore, not &s;ufficiently attending to the order that none of the people &s;hould be confined, had &s;ent him to the fort, and Mr. Hicks, the Fir&s;t Lieutenant, who commanded there, receiving him in charge from Gore, did not think him&s;elf at liberty to di&s;mi&s;s him.</P>
<P>The notion that we intended to put him to death had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed him &s;o &s;trongly, that he could not be per&s;uaded to the contrary till by my orders he was led out of the fort. The people received him as they would have done a father in the &s;ame circum&s;tances, and every one pre&s;&s;ed forward to em|brace him. Sudden joy is commonly liberal, without a &s;cru|pulous regard to merit; and Tootahah, in the fir&s;t expan&s;ion of his heart, upon being unexpectedly re&s;tored to liberty and life, in&s;i&s;ted upon our receiving a pre&s;ent of two hogs; though, being con&s;cious that upon this occa&s;ion we had no claim to favours, we refu&s;ed them many times.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="138"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Wedne&s;. 3.</NOTE>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander attended the next morning in their u&s;ual capacity of market-men, but very few Indians appeared, and tho&s;e who came brought no provi&s;ions. Too|tahah, however, &s;ent &s;ome of his people for the canoe that had been detained, which they took away. A canoe having al&s;o been detained that belonged to Oberea, TUPIA, the per&s;on who managed her affairs when the Dolphin was here, was &s;ent to examine whether any thing on board had been taken away: and he was &s;o well &s;atisfied of the contrary, that he left the canoe where he found it, and joined us at the fort, where he &s;pent the day, and &s;lept on board the canoe at night. About noon, &s;ome fi&s;hing boats came abrea&s;t of the tents, but would part with very little of what they had on board; and we felt the want of cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit very &s;e|verely. In the cour&s;e of the day, Mr. Banks walked out into the woods, that by conver&s;ing with the people he might re|cover their confidence and good-will: he found them civil, but they all complained of the ill-treatment of their Chief; who, they &s;aid, had been beaten and pulled by the hair. Mr. Banks endeavoured to convince them, that he had &s;uffered no per&s;onal violence, which to the be&s;t of our knowlege was true; yet, perhaps the Boat&s;wain had behaved with a bru|tality which he was afraid or a&s;hamed to acknowledge. The Chief him&s;elf being, probably, upon recollection, of opinion that we had ill-de&s;erved the hogs, which he had left with us as a pre&s;ent, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger in the afternoon to demand an ax, and a &s;hirt in return; but as I was told that he did not intend to come down to the fort for ten days, I excu&s;ed my|&s;elf from giving them till I &s;hould &s;ee him, hoping that his impatience might induce him to fetch them, and knowing that ab&s;ence would probably continue the coolne&s;s between us, to which the fir&s;t interview might put an end.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="139">The next day we were &s;till more &s;en&s;ible of the inconve|nience we had incurred by giving offence to the people in the per&s;on of their Chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Thur&s;day 4.</NOTE> for the market was &s;o ill &s;upplied that we were in want of nece&s;&s;aries. Mr. Banks therefore went into the woods to Tubourai Tamaide, and with &s;ome difficulty per&s;uaded him to let us have five ba&s;kets of bread|fruit; a very &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply, as they contained above one hundred and twenty. In the afternoon another me&s;&s;enger arrived from Tootahah for the ax and &s;hirt; as it was now become ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to recover the friend&s;hip of this man, without which it would be &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to procure provi&s;ions, I &s;ent word that Mr. Banks and my&s;elf would vi&s;it him on the morrow, and bring what he wanted with us.</P>
<P>Early the next morning he &s;ent again to remind me of my promi&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 5.</NOTE> and his people &s;eemed to wait till we &s;hould &s;et out with great impatience: I therefore ordered the pinnace, in which I embarked with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander about ten o'clock: we took one of Tootahah's people in the boat with us, and in about an hour we arrived at his place of re|&s;idence which is called EPARRE, and is about four miles to the we&s;tward of the tents.</P>
<P>We found the people waiting for us in great numbers upon the &s;hore, &s;o that it would have been impo&s;&s;ible for us to have proceeded, if way had not been made for us by a tall well-looking man, who had &s;omething like a turban about his head, and a long white &s;tick in his hand, with which he laid about him at an unmerciful rate. This man conducted us to the Chief, while the people &s;houted round us, <HI>Taio Tootahah,</HI> "Tootahah is your friend." We found him, like an ancient Patriarch, &s;itting under a tree, with a num|ber of venerable old men &s;tanding round him; he made a &s;ign to us to &s;it down, and immediately a&s;ked for his ax:
<PB N="118" REF="140">
this I pre&s;ented to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Friday 5.</NOTE> with an upper garment of broad|cloth, made after the country fa&s;hion, and trimmed with tape, to which I al&s;o added a &s;hirt: he received them with great &s;atisfaction, and immediately put on the garment; but the &s;hirt he gave to the per&s;on who had cleared the way for us upon our landing, who was now &s;eated by us, and of whom he &s;eemed de&s;irous that we &s;hould take particular notice. In a &s;hort time, Oberea, and &s;everal other women whom we knew, came and &s;at down among us: Tootahah left us &s;everal times, but after a &s;hort ab&s;ence returned; we thought it had been to &s;how him&s;elf in his new finery to the people, but we wronged him, for it was to give directions for our refre&s;hment and entertainment. While we were waiting for his return the la&s;t time he left us, very impatient to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, as we were almo&s;t &s;uffocated in the croud, word was brought us, that he expected us el&s;ewhere: we found him &s;itting under the awning of our own boat, and making &s;igns that we &s;hould come to him: as many of us therefore went on board as the boat would hold, and he then ordered bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts to be brought, of both which we ta&s;ted, rather to gratify him than becau&s;e we had a de&s;ire to eat. A me&s;&s;age was &s;oon after brought him, upon which he went out of the boat, and we were in a &s;hort time de&s;ired to follow. We were conducted to a large area or court-yard, which was railed round with bamboos about three feet high, on one &s;ide of his hou&s;e, where an entertainment was pro|vided for us, entirely new: this was a wre&s;tling match. At the upper end of the area &s;at the Chief, and &s;everal of his principal men were ranged on each &s;ide of him, &s;o as to form a &s;emicircle; the&s;e were the judges, by whom the victor was to be applauded; &s;eats were al&s;o left for us at each end of the line, but we cho&s;e rather to be at liberty among the re&s;t of the &s;pectators.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="141">When all was ready, ten or twelve per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Friday 5.</NOTE> whom we un|der&s;tood to be the combatants, and who were naked, except a cloth that was fa&s;tened about the wai&s;t, entered the area, and walked &s;lowly round it, in a &s;tooping po&s;ture, with their left hands on their right brea&s;ts, and their right hands open, with which they frequently &s;truck the left fore-arm &s;o as to produce a quick &s;mart &s;ound: this was a general challenge to the combatants whom they were to engage, or any other per&s;on pre&s;ent: after the&s;e followed others in the &s;ame man|ner, and then a particular challenge was given, by which each man &s;ingled out his antagoni&s;t: this was done by join|ing the finger ends of both hands, and bringing them to the brea&s;t, at the &s;ame time moving the elbows up and down with a quick motion: if the per&s;on to whom this was ad|dre&s;&s;ed accepted the challenge, he repeated the &s;igns, and im|mediately each put him&s;elf into an attitude to engage: the next minute they clo&s;ed; but, except in fir&s;t &s;eizing each other, it was a mere conte&s;t of &s;trength: each endeavoured to lay hold of the other, fir&s;t by the thigh, and if that failed by the hand, the hair, the cloth, or el&s;ewhere as he could: when this was done they grappled, without the lea&s;t dexte|rity or &s;kill, till one of them, by having a more advanta|geous hold, or greater mu&s;cular force, threw the other on his back. When the conte&s;t was over, the old men gave their plaudit to the victor in a few words, which they repeated together in a kind of tune: his conque&s;t was al&s;o generally celebrated by three huzzas. The entertainment was then &s;u&s;pended for a few minutes, after which another couple of wre&s;tlers came forward and engaged in the &s;ame manner: if it happened that neither was thrown, after the conte&s;t had continued about a minute, they parted, either by con&s;ent or the intervention of their friends, and in this ca&s;e each &s;lapped his arm, as a challenge to a new engagement, either with
<PB N="120" REF="142">
the &s;ame antagoni&s;t or &s;ome other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Friday 5.</NOTE> While the wre&s;tlers were engaged, another party of men performed a dance which la&s;ted al&s;o about a minute; but neither of the&s;e parties took the lea&s;t notice of each other, their attention being wholly fixed on what they were doing. We ob&s;erved with plea&s;ure, that the conqueror never exulted over the vanqui&s;hed, and that the vanqui&s;hed never repined at the &s;ucce&s;s of the con|queror; the whole conte&s;t was carried on with perfect good-will and good-humour, though in the pre&s;ence of at lea&s;t five hundred &s;pectators, of whom &s;ome were women. The number of women indeed was comparatively &s;mall, none but tho&s;e of rank were pre&s;ent, and we had rea&s;on to believe that they would not have been &s;pectators of this exerci&s;e but in compliment to us.</P>
<P>This la&s;ted about two hours; during all which time the man who had made way for us when we landed, kept the people at a proper di&s;tance, by &s;triking tho&s;e who pre&s;&s;ed forward very &s;everely with his &s;tick: upon enquiry we learnt, that he was an officer belonging to Tootahah, acting as a ma&s;ter of the ceremonies.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e who are acquainted with the athletic &s;ports of very remote antiquity, not to remark a rude re&s;emblance of them in this wre&s;tling-match among the natives of a little i&s;land in the mid&s;t of the Pacific Ocean: and even our female readers may recollect the account given of them by Fenelon in his Telemachus, where, though the events are fictitious, the manners of the age are faithfully tran&s;cribed from authors by whom they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been truly related.</P>
<P>When the wre&s;tling was over, we were given to under|&s;tand that two hogs, and a large quantity of bread-fruit were preparing for our dinner, which, as our appetites were now
<PB N="121" REF="143">
keen, was very agreeable intelligence. Our ho&s;t, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Friday 5.</NOTE> &s;eemed to repent of his liberality; for, in&s;tead of &s;etting his two hogs before us, he ordered one of them to be carried into our boat; at fir&s;t we were not &s;orry for this new di&s;po|&s;ition of matters, thinking that we &s;hould dine more com|fortably in the boat than on &s;hore, as the croud would more ea&s;ily be kept at a di&s;tance: but when we came on board, he ordered us to proceed with his hog to the &s;hip; this was mortifying, as we were now to row four miles while our dinner was growing cold; however, we thought fit to com|ply, and were at la&s;t gratified with the cheer that he had provided, of which he and Tubourai Tamaide had a liberal &s;hare.</P>
<P>Our reconciliation with this man operated upon the people like a charm; for he was no &s;ooner known to be on board, than bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other provi&s;ions were brought to the fort in great plenty.</P>
<P>Affairs now went on in the u&s;ual channel; but pork being &s;till a &s;carce commodity, our Ma&s;ter, Mr. Mollineux, and Mr. Green went in the pinnace to the ea&s;tward, on the 8th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 8.</NOTE> early in the morning, to &s;ee whether they could procure any hogs or poultry in that part of the country: they proceeded in that direction twenty miles; but though they &s;aw many hogs, and one turtle, they could not purcha&s;e either at any price: the people everywhere told them, that they all be|longed to Tootahah, and that they could fell none of them without his permi&s;&s;ion. We now began to think that this man was indeed a great Prince; for an influence &s;o exten|&s;ive and ab&s;olute could be acquired by no other. And we afterwards found that he admini&s;tered the government of this part of the i&s;land, as &s;overeign, for a minor whom we never &s;aw all the time that we were upon it. When Mr.
<PB N="122" REF="144">
Green returned from this expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Monday 8.</NOTE> he &s;aid he had &s;een a tree of a &s;ize which he was afraid to relate, it being no le&s;s than &s;ixty yards in circumference; but Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander &s;oon explained to him, that it was a &s;pecies of the fig, the branches of which, bending down, take fre&s;h root in the earth, and thus form a congeries of trunks, which being very clo&s;e to each other, and all joined by a common vegetation, might ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for one.</P>
<P>Though the market at the fort was now tolerably &s;up|plied, provi&s;ions were brought more &s;lowly: a &s;ufficient quantity u&s;ed to be purcha&s;ed between &s;un-ri&s;e and eight o'clock, but it was now become nece&s;&s;ary to attend the great|e&s;t part of the day. Mr. Banks, therefore, fixed his little boat up before the door of the fort, which was of great u&s;e as a place to trade in: hitherto we had purcha&s;ed cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit for beads; but the market becoming rather &s;lack in the&s;e articles, we were now, for the fir&s;t time, forced to bring out our nails: one of our &s;malle&s;t &s;ize, which was about four inches long, procured us twenty cocoa-nuts, and bread-fruit in proportion, &s;o that in a &s;hort time our fir&s;t plenty was re&s;tored.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 9.</NOTE>On the 9th, &s;oon after breakfa&s;t, we received a vi&s;it from Oberea, being the fir&s;t that &s;he had made us after the lo&s;s of our quadrant, and the unfortunate confinement of Toota|hah; with her came her pre&s;ent favourite, Obad&eacute;e, and Tu|pia: they brought us a hog and &s;ome bread-fruit, in return for which we gave her a hatchet. We had now afforded our Indian friends a new and intere&s;ting object of curio&s;ity, our forge, which having been &s;et up &s;ome time, was almo&s;t con|&s;tantly at work. It was now common for them to bring pieces of iron, which we &s;uppo&s;ed they mu&s;t have got from the Dolphin, to be made into tools of various kinds; and as
<PB N="123" REF="145">
I was very de&s;irous to gratify them, they were indulged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Tue&s;day 9.</NOTE> ex|cept when the &s;mith's time was too precious to be &s;pared. Oberea having received her hatchet, produced as much old iron as would have made another, with a reque&s;t that ano|ther might be made of it: in this, however, I could not gra|tify her, upon which &s;he brought out a broken ax, and de|&s;ired it might be mended; I was glad of an opportunity to compromi&s;e the difference between us: her ax was mended, and &s;he appeared to be content. They went away at night, and took with them the canoe, which had been a con&s;ide|rable time at the point, but promi&s;ed to return in three days.</P>
<P>On the 10th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 10.</NOTE> I put &s;ome &s;eeds of melons and other plants into a &s;pot of ground which had been turned up for the purpo&s;e; they had all been &s;ealed up by the per&s;on of whom they were bought, in &s;mall bottles with ro&s;in; but none of them came up except mu&s;tard; even the cucumbers and me|lons failed, and Mr. Banks is of opinion that they were &s;poiled by the total exclu&s;ion of fre&s;h air.</P>
<P>This day we learnt the Indian name of the i&s;land, which is OTAHEITE, and by that name I &s;hall hereafter di&s;tingui&s;h it: but after great pains taken we found it utterly impo&s;&s;ible to teach the Indians to pronounce our names; we had, there|fore, new names, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch &s;ounds as they produced in the attempt. They called me <HI>Toote</HI>; Mr. Hicks, <HI>Hete</HI>; Molineux they renounced in ab&s;olute de&s;pair, and called the Ma&s;ter <HI>Boba,</HI> from his Chri&s;tian name Robert; Mr. Gore was <HI>Toarro</HI>; Dr. Solander, <HI>Torano</HI>; and Mr. Banks, <HI>Tapane</HI>; Mr. Green, <HI>Eteree</HI>; Mr. Parkin&s;on, <HI>Patini</HI>; Mr. Sporing, <HI>Polini</HI>; Peter&s;gill, <HI>Petrodero</HI>; and in this manner they had now formed names for almo&s;t every man in the &s;hip: in &s;ome, however, it was not ea&s;y to find any traces of the original,
<PB N="124" REF="146">
and they were perhaps not mere arbitrary &s;ounds formed upon the occa&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Wedne&s;. 10.</NOTE> but &s;ignificant words in their own lan|guage. Monkhou&s;e, the Mid&s;hipman, who commanded the party that killed the man for &s;tealing the mu&s;ket, they called <HI>Matte</HI>; not merely by an attempt to imitate in &s;ound the fir&s;t &s;yllable of Monkhou&s;e, but becau&s;e <HI>Matte</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>dead</HI>; and this probably might be the ca&s;e with others.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 12.</NOTE>FRIDAY, the 12th of May, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a vi&s;it from &s;ome ladies whom we had never &s;een before, and who introduced them&s;elves with &s;ome very &s;ingular ceremo|nies. Mr. Banks was trading in his boat at the gate of the fort as u&s;ual, in company with Tootahah, who had that morning paid him a vi&s;it, and &s;ome other of the natives; be|tween nine and ten o'clock, a double canoe came to the landing-place, under the awning of which &s;at a man and two women: the Indians that were about him made &s;igns that he &s;hould go out to meet them, which he ha&s;ted to do; but by the time he could get out of the boat, they had ad|vanced within ten yards of him: they then &s;topped, and made &s;igns that he &s;hould do &s;o too, laying down about a dozen young plantain trees, and &s;ome other &s;mall plants: he complied, and the people having made a lane between
<PB N="125" REF="147">
them, the man, who appeared to be a &s;ervant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Friday 12.</NOTE> brought them to Mr. Banks by one of each at a time, pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing &s;ix times, and always pronouncing a &s;hort &s;entence when he delivered them. Tupia, who &s;tood by Mr. Banks, acted as his ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, and receiving the branches as they were brought, laid them down in the boat. When this was done, another man brought a large bundle of cloth, which having opened, he &s;pread piece by piece upon the ground, in the &s;pace between Mr. Banks and has vi&s;itors; there were nine pieces, and having laid three pieces one upon another, the foremo&s;t of the women, who &s;eemed to be the principal, and who was called OORATTOOA, &s;tepped upon them, and taking up her garments all round her to the wai&s;t, turned about, with great compo&s;ure and deliberation, and with an air of perfect innocence and &s;implicity, three times; when this was done, &s;he dropped the veil, and &s;tep|ping off the cloth, three more pieces were laid on, and &s;he repeated the ceremony, then &s;tepping off as before; the la&s;t three were laid on, and the ceremony was repeated in the &s;ame manner the third time. Immediately after this the cloth was rolled up, and given to Mr. Banks, as a pre|&s;ent from the lady, who, with her friend, came up and &s;a|luted him. He made &s;uch pre&s;ents to them both as he thought would be mo&s;t acceptable, and after having &s;taid about an hour they went away. In the evening, the Gentle|men at the fort had a vi&s;it from Oberea, and her favourite female attendant, who&s;e name was OTHEOTHEA, an agree|able girl, whom they were the more plea&s;ed to &s;ee, becau&s;e, having been &s;ome days ab&s;ent, it had been reported that &s;he was either &s;ick or dead.</P>
<P>On the 13th, the market being over about ten o'clock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 13.</NOTE> Mr. Banks walked into the woods with his gun, as he generally did, for the benefit of the &s;hade in the heat of the day: as he
<PB N="126" REF="148">
was returning back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Saturday 13.</NOTE> he met Tubourai Tamaide, near his oc|ca&s;ional dwelling, and &s;topping to &s;pend a little time with him, he &s;uddenly took the gun out of Mr. Banks's hand, cocked it, and, holding it up in the air, drew the trigger: fortunately for him, it fla&s;hed in the pan: Mr. Banks imme|diately took it from him, not a little &s;urpri&s;ed how he had acquired &s;ufficient knowlege of a gun to di&s;charge it, and re|proved him with great &s;everity for what he had done. As it was of infinite importance to keep the Indians totally igno|rant of the management of fire-arms, he had taken every opportunity of intimating that they could never offend him &s;o highly as by even touching his piece; it was now proper to enforce this prohibition, and he therefore added threats to his reproof: the Indian bore all patiently; but the moment Mr. Banks cro&s;&s;ed the river, he &s;et off with all his family and furniture for his hou&s;e at Eparre. This being quickly known from the Indians at the fort, and great inconvenience being apprehended from the di&s;plea&s;ure of this man, who upon all occa&s;ions had been particularly u&s;eful, Mr. Banks determined to follow him without delay, and &s;olicit his re|turn: he &s;et out the &s;ame evening, accompanied by Mr. Mol|lineux, and found him &s;itting in the middle of a large circle of people, to whom he had probably related what had hap|pened, and his fears of the con&s;equences; he was him&s;elf the very picture of grief and dejection, and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions were &s;trongly marked in the countenances of all the people that &s;urrounded him. When Mr. Banks and Mr. Mollineux went into the circle, one of the women expre&s;&s;ed her trou|ble, as Terapo had done upon another occa&s;ion, and &s;truck a &s;hark's tooth into her head &s;everal times, till it was covered with blood. Mr. Banks lo&s;t no time in putting an end to this univer&s;al di&s;tre&s;s; he a&s;&s;ured the Chief, that every thing which had pa&s;&s;ed &s;hould be forgotten, that there was not
<PB N="127" REF="149">
the lea&s;t animo&s;ity remaining on one &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Saturday 13.</NOTE> nor any thing to be feared on the other. The Chief was &s;oon &s;oothed into confidence and complacency, a double canoe was ordered to be got ready, they all returned together to the fort before &s;upper, and as a pledge of perfect reconciliation, both he and his wife &s;lept all night in Mr. Banks's tent: their pre&s;ence, however, was no palladium; for, between eleven and twelve o'clock, one of the natives attempted to get into the fort by &s;caling the walls, with a de&s;ign, no doubt, to &s;teal whatever he &s;hould happen to find; he was di&s;covered by the centinel, who hap|pily did not fire, and he ran away much fa&s;ter than any of our people could follow him. The iron, and iron-tools, which were in continual u&s;e at the armourer's forge, that was &s;et up within the works, were temptations to theft which none of the&s;e people could with&s;tand.</P>
<P>On the 14th, which was Sunday,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 14.</NOTE> I directed that Divine Service &s;hould be performed at the fort: we were de&s;irous that &s;ome of the principal Indians &s;hould be pre&s;ent, but when the hour came, mo&s;t of them were returned home. Mr. Banks, however, cro&s;&s;ed the river, and brought back Tu|bourai Tamaide and his wife Tomio, hoping that it would give occa&s;ion to &s;ome enquiries on their part, and &s;ome in|&s;truction on ours: having &s;eated them, he placed him&s;elf between them, and during the whole &s;ervice, they very at|tentively ob&s;erved his behaviour, and very exactly imitated it; &s;tanding, &s;itting, or kneeling, as they &s;aw him do: they were con&s;cious that we were employed about &s;omewhat &s;e|rious and important, as appeared by their calling to the In|dians without the fort to be &s;ilent; yet when the &s;ervice was over, neither of them a&s;ked any que&s;tions, nor would they attend to any attempt that was made to explain what had been done.</P>

traced it to a part of the bay where he was told it had been put into a canoe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Monday 15.</NOTE> but as it was not of great con&s;equence he did not complete the di&s;covery. When he returned, he was told by Tubourai Tamaide, that another ca&s;k would be &s;tolen before the morning: how he came by this knowlege it is not ea&s;y to imagine; that he was not a party in the de&s;ign is certain, for he came with his wife and his family to the place where the water ca&s;ks &s;tood, and placing their beds near them, he &s;aid he would him&s;elf be a pledge for their &s;afety, in de&s;pight of the thief: of this, however, we would not admit; and making him under&s;tand that a &s;entry would be placed to watch the ca&s;ks till the morning, he removed the beds into Mr. Banks's tent, where he and his family &s;pent the night, making &s;igns to the &s;entry when he retired, that he &s;hould keep his eyes open. In the night this intelligence appeared to be true; about twelve o'clock the thief came, but di&s;covering that a watch had been &s;et, he went away without his booty.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks's confidence in Tubourai Tamaide had greatly increa&s;ed &s;ince the affair of the knife, in con&s;equence of which he was at length expo&s;ed to temptations which nei|ther his integrity nor his honour was able to re&s;i&s;t. They had with&s;tood many allurements, but were at length en|&s;nared by the fa&s;cinating charms of a ba&s;ket of nails; the&s;e nails were much larger than any that had yet been brought into trade, and had, with perhaps &s;ome degree of criminal negligence, been left in a corner of Mr. Banks's tent, to which the Chief had always free acce&s;s. One of the&s;e nails Mr. Banks's &s;ervant happened to &s;ee in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, upon his having inadvertently thrown back that part of his gar|ment under which it was concealed. Mr. Banks being told of this, and knowing that no &s;uch thing had been given
<PB N="130" REF="152">
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Monday 15.</NOTE> either as a pre&s;ent or in barter, immediately examined the ba&s;ket, and di&s;covered, that out of &s;even nails five were mi&s;&s;ing. He then, though not without great reluctance, charged him with the fact, which he immediately confe&s;&s;ed, and however he might &s;uffer, was probably not more hurt than his accu&s;er. A demand was immediately made of re&s;ti|tution; but this he declined, &s;aying, that the nails were at Eparre: however, Mr. Banks appearing to be much in ear|ne&s;t, and u&s;ing &s;ome threatening &s;igns, he thought fit to produce one of them. He was then taken to the fort, to re|ceive &s;uch judgment as &s;hould be given again&s;t him by the general voice.</P>
<P>After &s;ome deliberation, that we might not appear to think too lightly of his offence, he was told, that if he would bring the other four nails to the fort, it &s;hould be forgotten. To this condition he agreed; but I am &s;orry to &s;ay he did not fulfil it. In&s;tead of fetching the nails, he removed with his family before night, and took all his furniture with him.</P>
<P>As our long-boat had appeared to be leaky, I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to examine her bottom, and, to my great &s;urprize, found it &s;o much eaten by the worms, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to give her a new one; no &s;uch accident had happened to the Dolphin's boats, as I was informed by the officers on board, and therefore it was a misfortune that I did not ex|pect: I feared that the pinnace al&s;o might be nearly in the &s;ame condition; but, upon examining her, I had the &s;atis|faction to find that not a worm had touched her, though &s;he was built of the &s;ame wood, and had been as much in the water; the rea&s;on of this difference I imagine to be, that the long-boat was paid with varni&s;h of pine, and the pinnace painted with white lead and oil; the bottoms of all boats therefore which are &s;ent into this country &s;hould be painted
<PB N="131" REF="153">
like that of the pinnace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May.</NOTE> and the &s;hips &s;hould be &s;upplied with a good &s;tock, in order to give them a new coating when it &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Having received repeated me&s;&s;ages from Tootahah,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 24.</NOTE> that if we would pay him a vi&s;it he would acknowledge the fa|vour by a pre&s;ent of four hogs, I &s;ent Mr. Hicks, my Fir&s;t Lieutenant, to try if he could not procure the hogs upon ea&s;ier terms, with orders to &s;how him every civility in his power. Mr. Hicks found that he was removed from Eparre to a place called TETTAHAH, five miles farther to the we&s;tward. He was received with great cordiality; one hog was imme|diately produced, and he was told that the other three, which were at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;hould be brought in the morn|ing. Mr. Hicks readily con&s;ented to &s;tay; but the morning came without the hogs, and it not being convenient to &s;tay longer, he returned in the evening, with the one that he had got.</P>
<P>On the 25th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 25.</NOTE> Tubourai Tamaide and his wife Tomio made their appearance at the tent, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince he had been detected in &s;tealing the nails; he &s;eemed to be under &s;ome di&s;content and apprehen&s;ion, yet he did not think fit to purcha&s;e our countenance and good-will by re&s;toring the four which he had &s;ent away. As Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen treated him with a coolne&s;s and re&s;erve which did not at all tend to re&s;tore his peace or good-humour, his &s;tay was &s;hort, and his departure abrupt. Mr. Monkhou&s;e, the Surgeon, went the next morning in order to effect a re|conciliation, by per&s;uading him to bring down the nails, but he could not &s;ucceed.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Saturday 27.</NOTE>ON the 27th, was determined that we &s;hould pay our vi&s;it to Tootahah, though we were not very confident that we &s;hould receive the hogs for our pains. I therefore &s;et out early in the morning, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solan|der, and three others, in the pinnace. He was now removed from Tettahah, where Mr. Hicks had &s;een him, to a place called ATAHOUROU, about &s;ix miles farther, and as we could not go above half way thither in the boat, it was almo&s;t evening before we arrived: we found him in his u&s;ual &s;tate, &s;itting under a tree, with a great crowd about him. We made our pre&s;ents in due form, con&s;i&s;ting of a yellow &s;tuff petticoat, and &s;ome other trifling articles, which were gra|ciou&s;ly received; a hog was immediately ordered to be killed and dre&s;&s;ed for &s;upper, with a promi&s;e of more in the morn|ing: however, as we were le&s;s de&s;irous of fea&s;ting upon our journey than of carrying back with us provi&s;ions, which would be more welcome at the fort, we procured a reprieve for the hog, and &s;upped upon the fruits of the country. As night now came on, and the place was crowded with many more than the hou&s;es and canoes would contain; there being Oberea with her attendants, and many other travellers whom we knew, we began to look out for lodgings. Our party
<PB N="133" REF="155">
con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ix:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Saturday 27.</NOTE> Mr. Banks thought him&s;elf fortunate in be|ing offered a place by Oberea in her canoe, and wi&s;hing his friends a good night, took his leave. He went to re&s;t early, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, and taking off his clothes, as was his con&s;tant practice, the nights being hot, Oberea kindly in&s;i&s;ted upon taking them into her own cu&s;to|dy, for otherwi&s;e &s;he &s;aid they would certainly be &s;tolen. Mr. Banks having &s;uch a &s;afeguard, re&s;igned him&s;elf to &s;leep with all imaginable tranquillity: but awaking about eleven o'clock, and wanting to get up, he &s;earched for his clothes where he had &s;een them depo&s;ited by Oberea when he lay down to &s;leep, and &s;oon perceived that they were mi&s;&s;ing. He immediately awakened Oberea, who &s;tarting up, and hearing his complaint, ordered lights, and prepared in great ha&s;te to recover what he had lo&s;t: Tootahah him&s;elf &s;lept in the next canoe, and being &s;oon alarmed, he came to them and &s;et out with Oberea in &s;earch of the thief: Mr. Banks was not in a condition to go with them, for of his apparel &s;carce any thing was left him but his breeches; his coat, and his wai&s;tcoat, with his pi&s;tols, powder-horn, and many other things that were in the pockets, were gone. In about half an hour his two noble friends returned, but without having obtained any intelligence of his clothes or of the thief. At fir&s;t he began to be alarmed, his mu&s;quet had not indeed been taken away, but he had neglected to load it; where I and Dr. Solander had di&s;po&s;ed of our&s;elves he did not know; and therefore, whatever might happen, he could not have recour&s;e to us for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He thought it be&s;t, however, to expre&s;s neither fear nor &s;u&s;picion of tho&s;e about him, and giving his mu&s;quet to Tupia, who had been waked in the confu&s;ion and &s;tood by him, with a charge not to &s;uffer it to be &s;tolen, he betook him&s;elf again to re&s;t, declaring him&s;elf perfectly &s;atisfied with the pains that Tootahah and Oberea
<PB N="134" REF="156">
had taken to recover his things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Saturday 27.</NOTE> though they had not been &s;ucce&s;sful. As it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that in &s;uch a &s;ituation his &s;leep was very &s;ound, he &s;oon after heard mu&s;ic, and &s;aw lights at a little di&s;tance on &s;hore: this was a concert or a&s;|&s;embly, which they call a HEIVA, a common name for every public exhibition; and as it would nece&s;&s;arily bring many people together, and there was a chance of my being among them with his other friends, he ro&s;e, and made the be&s;t of his way towards it: he was &s;oon led by the lights and the &s;ound to the hut where I lay, with three other Gentlemen of our party; and ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hing us from the re&s;t, he made up to us more than half naked, and told us his me|lancholy &s;tory. We gave him &s;uch comfort as the unfortu|nate generally give to each other, by telling him that we were fellow-&s;ufferers; I &s;howed him that I was my&s;elf with|out &s;tockings, they having been &s;tolen from under my head, though I was &s;ure I had never been a&s;leep, and each of my a&s;&s;ociates convinced him, by his appearance, that he had lo&s;t a jacket. We determined, however, to hear out the concert, however deficient we might appear in our dre&s;s; it con&s;i&s;ted of three drums, four flutes, and &s;everal voices: when this entertainment, which la&s;ted about an hour, was over, we retired again to our &s;leeping-places; having agreed, that no|thing could be done toward the recovery of our things till the morning.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 28.</NOTE>We ro&s;e at day-break, according to the cu&s;tom of the country; the fir&s;t man that Mr. Banks &s;aw was Tupia, faith|fully attending with his mu&s;quet; and &s;oon after, Oberea brought him &s;ome of her country clothes, as a &s;uccedaneum for his own, &s;o that when he came to us he made a mo&s;t motley appearance, half Indian and half Engli&s;h. Our party &s;oon got together, except Dr. Solander, who&s;e quarters we did not know, and who had not a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the concert: in a
<PB N="135" REF="157">
&s;hort time Tootahah made his appearance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Sunday 28.</NOTE> and we pre&s;&s;ed him to recover our clothes; but neither he nor Oberea could be per&s;uaded to take any mea&s;ure for that purpo&s;e, &s;o that we began to &s;u&s;pect that they had been parties in the theft. About eight o'clock, we were joined by Dr. Solander, who had fallen into hone&s;ter hands, at a hou&s;e about a mile di&s;|tant, and had lo&s;t nothing.</P>
<P>Having given up all hope of recovering our clothes, which indeed were never afterwards heard of, we &s;pent all the morning in &s;oliciting the hogs which we had been promi&s;ed; but in this we had no better &s;ucce&s;s: we therefore, in no very good humour, &s;et out for the boat about twelve o'clock, with only that which we had redeemed from the butcher and the cook the night before.</P>
<P>As we were returning to the boat, however, we were enter|tained with a &s;ight that in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ated for our fatigue and di&s;appointment. In our way we came to one of the few places where acce&s;s to the i&s;land is not guarded by a reef, and, con&s;equently, a high &s;urf breaks upon the &s;hore; a more dreadful one indeed I had &s;eldom &s;een; it was impo&s;|&s;ible for any European boat to have lived in it; and if the be&s;t &s;wimmer in Europe had, by any accident, been expo&s;ed to its fury, I am confident that he would not have been able to pre&s;erve him&s;elf from drowning, e&s;pecially as the &s;hore was covered with pebbles and large &s;tones; yet, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e breakers, were ten or twelve Indians &s;wimming for their amu&s;ement: whenever a &s;urf broke near them, they dived under it, and, to all appearance with infinite facility, ro&s;e again on the other &s;ide. This diver&s;ion was greatly im|proved by the &s;tern of an old canoe, which they happened to find upon the &s;pot; they took this before them, and &s;wam out with it as far as the outermo&s;t breach, then two or three
<PB N="136" REF="158">
of them getting into it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Sunday 28.</NOTE> and turning the &s;quare end to the breaking wave, were driven in towards the &s;hore with incre|dible rapidity, &s;ometimes almo&s;t to the beach; but generally the wave broke over them before they got half way, in which ca&s;e they dived, and ro&s;e on the other &s;ide with the canoe in their hands: they then &s;wam out with it again, and were again driven back, ju&s;t as our holiday youth climb the hill in Greenwich park for the plea&s;ure of rolling down it. At this wonderful &s;cene we &s;tood gazing for more than half an hour, during which time none of the &s;wimmers attempted to come on &s;hore, but &s;eemed to enjoy their &s;port in the highe&s;t degree; we then proceeded in our journey, and late in the evening got back to the fort.</P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion it may be ob&s;erved, that human nature is endued with powers which are only accidentally exerted to the utmo&s;t; and that all men are capable of what no man attains, except he is &s;timulated to the effort by &s;ome uncom|mon circum&s;tances or &s;ituation. The&s;e Indians effected what to us appeared to be &s;upernatural, merely by the application of &s;uch powers as they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common with us, and all other men who have no particular infirmity or defect. The truth of the ob&s;ervation is al&s;o manife&s;t from more familiar in&s;tances. The rope-dancer and balance-ma&s;ter owe their art, not to any peculiar liberality of Nature, but to an acci|dental improvement of her common gifts; and though equal diligence and application would not always produce equal excellence in the&s;e, any more than in other arts; yet there is no doubt but that a certain degree of proficiency in them might be univer&s;ally attained. Another proof of the exi&s;tence of abilities in mankind, that are almo&s;t univer&s;ally dormant, is furni&s;hed by the attainments of blind men. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the lo&s;s of one &s;en&s;e, like the am|putation
<PB N="137" REF="159">
of a branch from a tree,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. May. Sunday 28.</NOTE> gives new vigour to tho&s;e that remain. Every man's hearing and touch, therefore, are capable of the nice di&s;tinctions which a&s;toni&s;h us in tho&s;e that have lo&s;t their &s;ight, and if they do not give the &s;ame intelligence to the mind, it is merely becau&s;e the &s;ame intel|ligence is not required of them: he that can &s;ee may do from choice what the blind do by nece&s;&s;ity, and by the &s;ame diligent attention to the other &s;en&s;es, may receive the &s;ame notices from them; let it therefore be remembered as an en|couragement to per&s;evering diligence, and a principle of ge|neral u&s;e to mankind, that he who does all he can, will ever effect much more than is generally thought to be po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Among other Indians that had vi&s;ited us, there were &s;ome from a neighbouring i&s;land which they called EIMEO or IMAO, the &s;ame to which Captain Wallis had given the name of the Duke of York's i&s;land, and they gave us an account of no le&s;s than two and twenty i&s;lands that lay in the neighbour|hood of Otaheite.</P>
<P>As the day of ob&s;ervation now approached, I determined, in con&s;equence of &s;ome hints which had been given me by Lord Morton, to &s;end out two parties to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it from other &s;ituations; hoping, that if we &s;hould fail at Otaheite, they might have better &s;ucce&s;s. We were, there|fore, now bu&s;ily employed in preparing our in&s;truments, and in&s;tructing &s;uch Gentlemen in the u&s;e of them as I in|tended to &s;end out.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 1&s;t of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June. Thur&s;day 1.</NOTE> the Saturday following being the day of the Tran&s;it, I di&s;patched Mr. Gore in the long-boat to Imao, with Mr. Monkhou&s;e and Mr. Sporing, a Gen|tleman belonging to Mr. Banks, Mr. Green having furni&s;hed them with proper in&s;truments. Mr. Banks him&s;elf thought
<PB N="138" REF="160">
fit to go upon this expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Thur&s;day 1.</NOTE> and &s;everal natives, particu|larly Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio, were al&s;o of the party. Very early on the Friday morning, I &s;ent Mr. Hicks, with Mr. Clerk and Mr. Peter&s;gill, the Ma&s;ter's Mates, and Mr. Saunders, one of the Mid&s;hipmen, in the pinnace to the ea&s;t|ward, with orders to &s;ix on &s;ome convenient &s;pot, at a di&s;tance from our principal ob&s;ervatory, where they al&s;o might em|ploy the in&s;truments with which they had been furni&s;hed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The long-boat not having been got ready till Thur&s;day in the afternoon, though all po&s;&s;ible expedition was u&s;ed to fit her out; the people on board, after having rowed mo&s;t part of the night, brought her to a grappling ju&s;t under the land of Imao.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 2.</NOTE> Soon after day-break, they &s;aw an Indian canoe, which they hailed, and the people on board &s;hewed them an inlet through the reef into which they pulled, and &s;oon fixed upon a coral rock, which ro&s;e out of the water about one hundred and fifty yards from the &s;hore, as a proper &s;itua|tion for their ob&s;ervatory: it was about eighty yards long and twenty broad, and in the middle of it was a bed of white &s;and, large enough for the tents to &s;tand upon. Mr. Gore and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants immediately began to &s;et them up, and make other nece&s;&s;ary preparations for the important bu&s;ine&s;s of the next day. While this was doing, Mr. Banks, with the Indians of Otaheite, and the people whom they had met in the canoe, went a&s;hore upon the main i&s;land, to buy provi&s;ions; of which he procured a &s;ufficient &s;upply before night. When he returned to the rock he found the ob&s;ervatory in order, and the tele&s;copes all fixed and tried. The evening was very fine, yet their &s;olicitude did not permit them to take much re&s;t in the night: one or other of them was up every half hour, who &s;atisfied the impatience of the re&s;t by reporting
<PB N="139" REF="161">
the changes of the &s;ky;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June.</NOTE> now encouraging their hope by tell|ing them that it was clear, and now alarming their fears by an account that it was hazey.</P>
<P>At day-break they got up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 3.</NOTE> and had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the &s;un ri&s;e, without a cloud. Mr. Banks then, wi&s;hing the ob&s;ervers, Mr. Gore and Mr. Monkhou&s;e, &s;ucce&s;s, repaired again to the i&s;land, that he might examine its produce, and get a fre&s;h &s;upply of provi&s;ions: he began by trading with the natives, for which purpo&s;e he took his &s;tation under a tree; and to keep them from pre&s;&s;ing upon him in a crowd, he drew a circle round him, which he &s;uffered none of them to enter.</P>
<P>About eight o'clock, he &s;aw two canoes coming towards the place, and was given to under&s;tand by the people about him, that they belonged to TARRAO, the King of the i&s;land, who was coming to make him a vi&s;it. As &s;oon as the canoes came near the &s;hore, the people made a lane from the beach to the trading-place, and his Maje&s;ty landed, with his &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e name was NUNA; as they advanced towards the tree where Mr. Banks &s;tood, he went out to meet them, and, with great formality, introduced them into the circle from which the other natives had been excluded. As it is the cu&s;tom of the&s;e people to &s;it during all their conferences, Mr. Banks un|wrapped a kind of Turban of Indian cloth, which he wore upon his head in&s;tead of a hat, and &s;preading it upon the ground, they all &s;at down upon it together. The royal pre|&s;ent was then brought, which con&s;i&s;ted of a hog and a dog, &s;ome bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and other articles of the like kind. Mr. Banks then di&s;patched a canoe to the ob&s;ervatory for his pre&s;ent, and the me&s;&s;engers &s;oon returned with an adze, a &s;hirt, and &s;ome beads, which were pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, and received with great &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="162"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Saturday 3.</NOTE>By this time, Tubourai Tamaide and Tomio joined them, from the ob&s;ervatory. Tomio &s;aid, that &s;he was related to Tarrao, and brought him a pre&s;ent of a long nail, at the &s;ame time complimenting Nuna with a &s;hirt.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t internal contact of the planet with the &s;un being over, Mr. Banks returned to the ob&s;ervatory, taking Tarrao, Nuna, and &s;ome of their principal attendants, among whom were three very hand&s;ome young women, with him: he &s;howed them the planet upon the &s;un, and endeavoured to make them under&s;tand that he and his companions had come from their own country on purpo&s;e to &s;ee it. Soon after, Mr. Banks returned with them to the i&s;land, where he &s;pent the re&s;t of the day in examining its produce, which he found to be much the &s;ame with that of Otaheite. The people whom he &s;aw there al&s;o exactly re&s;embled the inhabitants of that i&s;land, and many of them were per&s;ons whom he had &s;een upon it; &s;o that all tho&s;e whom he had dealt with, knew of what his trading articles con&s;i&s;ted, and the value they bore.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 4.</NOTE>The next morning, having &s;truck the tents, they &s;et out on their return, and arrived at the fort before night.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervation was made with equal &s;ucce&s;s by the per|&s;ons whom I had &s;ent to the ea&s;tward, and at the fort, there not being a cloud in the &s;ky from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting of the &s;un, the whole pa&s;&s;age of the planet Venus over the &s;un's di&s;k was ob&s;erved with great advantage by Mr. Green, Dr. Solander, and my&s;elf: Mr. Green's tele&s;cope and mine were of the &s;ame magnifying power, but that of Dr. Solan|der was greater. We all &s;aw an atmot&s;phere or du&s;ky cloud round the body of the planet, which very much di&s;turbed the times of contact, e&s;pecially of the internal ones; and we differed from each other in our accounts of the times of the

A more particular account will appear by the tables, for which the reader is referred to the Tran&s;actions of the Royal Society, vol. lxi. part 2. page 397 &amp; &s;eq. where they are illu&s;trated by a cut.</P>
<P>But if we had rea&s;on to congratulate our&s;elves upon the &s;ucce&s;s of our ob&s;ervation, we had &s;carce le&s;s cau&s;e to regret the diligence with which that time had been improved by &s;ome of our people to another purpo&s;e. While the attention of the officers was engro&s;&s;ed by the Tran&s;it of Venus, &s;ome of the &s;hip's company broke into one of the &s;tore-rooms, and &s;tole a quantity of &s;pike nails, amounting to no le&s;s than one hundred weight: this was a matter of public and &s;erious concern; for the&s;e nails, if circulated by the people among the Indians, would do us irreparable injury, by reducing the value of iron, our &s;taple commodity. One of the thieves was detected, but only &s;even nails were found in his cu&s;tody. He was puni&s;hed with two dozen la&s;hes, but would impeach none of his accomplices.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Monday 5.</NOTE>ON the 5th, we kept his Maje&s;ty's birth-day; for though it is the 4th, we were unwilling to celebrate it during the ab&s;ence of the two parties who had been &s;ent out to ob&s;erve the Tran&s;it. We had &s;everal of the Indian Chiefs at our entertainment, who drank his Maje&s;ty's health by the name of Kihiargo, which was the neare&s;t imitation they could produce of King George.</P>
<P>About this time died an old woman of &s;ome rank, who was related to Tomio, which gave us an opportunity to &s;ee how they di&s;po&s;ed of the body, and confirmed us in our opi|nion that the&s;e people, contrary to the pre&s;ent cu&s;tom of all other nations now known, never bury their dead. In the middle of a &s;mall &s;quare, neatly railed in with bamboo, the awning of a canoe was rai&s;ed upon two po&s;ts, and under this the body was depo&s;ited upon &s;uch a frame as has before been de&s;cribed: it was covered with fine cloth, and near it was placed bread-fruit, fi&s;h, and other provi&s;ions: we &s;up|po&s;ed that the food was placed there for the &s;pirit of the de|cea&s;ed, and con&s;equently, that the&s;e Indians had &s;ome con|fu&s;ed notion of a &s;eparate &s;tate; but upon our applying for
<PB N="143" REF="165">
further information to Tubourai Tamaide, he told us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Monday 5.</NOTE> that the food was placed there as an offering to their gods. They do not, however, &s;uppo&s;e, that the gods eat, any more than the Jews &s;uppo&s;ed that Jehovah could dwell in a hou&s;e: the offering is made here upon the &s;ame principle as the Temple was built at Jeru&s;alem, as an expre&s;&s;ion of reverence and gratitude, and a &s;olicitation of the more immediate pre&s;ence of the Deity. In the front of the area was a kind of &s;tile, where the relations of the decea&s;ed &s;tood to pay the tribute of their &s;orrow; and under the awning were innumerable &s;mall pieces of cloth, on which the tears and blood of the mourners had been &s;hed; for in their paroxy&s;ms of grief it is a univer&s;al cu&s;tom to wound them&s;elves with the &s;hark's tooth. Within a few yards two occa&s;ional hou&s;es were &s;et up, in one of which &s;ome relations of the decea&s;ed con&s;tantly re&s;ided, and in the other the chief mourner, who is always a man, and who keeps there a very &s;ingular dre&s;s in which a ceremony is performed that will be de&s;cribed in its turn. Near the place where the dead are thus &s;et up to rot, the bones are afterwards buried.</P>
<P>What can have introduced among the&s;e people the cu&s;tom of expo&s;ing their dead above ground, till the fle&s;h is con|&s;umed by putrefaction, and then burying the bones, it is perhaps impo&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s; but it is remarkable, that Aelian and Apollonius Rhodius impute a &s;imilar practice to the an|cient inhabitants of Colchis, a country near Pontus in A&s;ia, now called Mingrelia; except that among them this manner of di&s;po&s;ing of the dead did not extend to both &s;exes: the women they buried; but the men they wrapped in a hide, and hung up in the air by a chain. This practice among the Colchians is referred to a religious cau&s;e. The principal ob|jects of their wor&s;hip were the Earth and the Air; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that, in con&s;equence of &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious notion,
<PB N="144" REF="166">
they devoted their dead to both.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Monday 5.</NOTE> Whether the natives of Otaheite had any notion of the &s;ame kind we were never able certainly to determine; but we &s;oon di&s;covered, that the re|po&s;itories of their dead were al&s;o places of wor&s;hip. Upon this occa&s;ion it may be ob&s;erved, that nothing can be more ab&s;urd than the notion that the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of a fu|ture life depends, in any degree, upon the di&s;po&s;ition of the body when the &s;tate of probation is pa&s;t; yet that nothing is more general than a &s;olicitude about it. However cheap we may hold any funereal rites which cu&s;tom has not familiarized, or &s;uper&s;tition rendered &s;acred, mo&s;t men gravely deliberate how to prevent their body from being broken by the mat|tock and devoured by the worm, when it is no longer ca|pable of &s;en&s;ation; and purcha&s;e a place for it in holy ground, when they believe the lot of its future exi&s;tence to be irrevocably determined. So &s;trong is the a&s;&s;ociation of plea&s;ing or painful ideas with certain opinions and actions which affect us while we live, that we involuntarily act as if it was equally certain that they would affect us in the &s;ame manner when we are dead, though this is an opinion that nobody will maintain. Thus it happens, that the de&s;ire of pre&s;erving from reproach even the name that we leave be|hind us, or of procuring it honour, is one of the mo&s;t power|ful principles of action, among the inhabitants of the mo&s;t &s;peculative and enlightened nations. Po&s;thumous reputation, upon every principle, mu&s;t be acknowledged to have no in|fluence upon the dead; yet the de&s;ire of obtaining and &s;e|curing it, no force of rea&s;on, no habits of thinking can &s;ub|due, except in tho&s;e whom habitual ba&s;ene&s;s and guilt have rendered indifferent to honour and &s;hame while they lived. This indeed &s;eems to be among the happy imperfections of our nature, upon which the general good of &s;ociety in a cer|tain mea&s;ure depends; for as &s;ome crimes are &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="145" REF="167">
be prevented by hanging the body of the criminal in chains after he is dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Monday 5.</NOTE> &s;o in con&s;equence of the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, much good is procured to &s;ociety, and much evil pre|vented, by a de&s;ire of preventing di&s;grace or procuring ho|nour to a name, when nothing but a name remains.</P>
<P>Perhaps no better u&s;e can be made of reading an account of manners altogether new, by which the follies and ab&s;ur|dities of mankind are taken out of that particular connec|tion in which habit has reconciled them to us, than to con|&s;ider in how many in&s;tances they are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame. When an hone&s;t devotee of the Church of Rome reads, that there are Indians on the banks of the Ganges, who believe that they &s;hall &s;ecure the happine&s;s of a future &s;tate by dying with a cow's tail in their hands, he laughs at their folly and &s;uper&s;tition; and if the&s;e Indians were to be told, that there are people upon the continent of Europe, who imagine that they &s;hall derive the &s;ame advantage from dying with the &s;lipper of a St. Francis upon their foot, they would laugh in their turn. But if, when the Indian heard the account of the Catholic, and the Catholic that of the In|dian, each was to reflect, that there was no difference be|tween the ab&s;urdity of the &s;lipper and of the tail; but that the veil of prejudice and cu&s;tom, which covered it in their own ca&s;e, was withdrawn in the other, they would turn their knowlege to a profitable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erved that bread-fruit had for &s;ome days been brought in le&s;s quantities than u&s;ual, we enquired the rea&s;on; and were told, that there being a great &s;how of fruit upon the trees, they had been thinned all at once, in order to make a kind of &s;our pa&s;te, which the natives call <HI>Mahie,</HI> and which, in con&s;equence of having undergone a fermentation, will keep a con&s;iderable time, and &s;upply them with food when no ripe fruit is to be had.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="168"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Saturday 10.</NOTE>On the 10th, the ceremony was to be performed, in honour of the old woman who&s;e &s;epulchral tabernacle has ju&s;t been de&s;cribed, by the chief mourner; and Mr. Banks had &s;o great a curio&s;ity to &s;ee all the my&s;teries of the &s;olemnity, that he determined to take a part in it, being told, that he could be pre&s;ent upon no other condition. In the evening, there|fore, he repaired to the place where the body lay, and was received by the daughter of the decea&s;ed, and &s;everal other per&s;ons, among whom was a boy about fourteen years old, who were to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the ceremony. Tubourai Tamaide was to be the principal mourner; and his dre&s;s, which was ex|tremely fanta&s;tical, though not unbecoming, is repre&s;ented by a figure in one of the plates. Mr. Banks was &s;tripped of his European clothes, and a &s;mall piece of cloth being tied round his middle, his body was &s;meared with charcoal and water, as low as the &s;houlders, till it was as black as that of a ne|groe: the &s;ame operation was performed upon &s;everal others, among whom were &s;ome women, who were reduced to a &s;tate as near to nakedne&s;s as him&s;elf; the boy was blacked all over, and then the proce&s;&s;ion &s;et forward. Tubourai Tamaide uttered &s;omething, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a prayer, near the body; and did the &s;ame when he came up to his own hou&s;e: when this was done, the proce&s;&s;ion was continued towards the fort, permi&s;&s;ion having been obtained to approach it upon this occa&s;ion. It is the cu&s;tom of the Indians to fly from the&s;e proce&s;&s;ions with the utmo&s;t preci|pitation, &s;o that as &s;oon as tho&s;e who were about the fort, &s;aw it at a di&s;tance, they hid them&s;elves in the woods. It proceeded from the fort along the &s;hore, and put to flight another body of Indians, con&s;i&s;ting of more than an hun|dred, every one hiding him&s;elf under the fir&s;t &s;helter that he could find: it then cro&s;&s;ed the river, and entered the woods, pa&s;&s;ing &s;everal hou&s;es, all which were de&s;erted, and not a
<PB N="147" REF="169">
&s;ingle Indian could be &s;een during the re&s;t of the proce&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Saturday 10.</NOTE> which continued more than half an hour. The office that Mr. Banks performed, was called that of the <HI>Nineveh,</HI> of which there were two be&s;ides him&s;elf; and the natives having all di&s;appeared, they came to the chief mourner, and &s;aid <HI>imatata,</HI> there are no people, after which the company was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to wa&s;h them&s;elves in the river, and put on their cu&s;tomary apparel.</P>
<P>On the 12th, complaint being made to me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 12.</NOTE> by &s;ome of the natives, that two of the &s;eamen had taken from them &s;everal bows and arrows, and &s;ome &s;trings of plaited hair, I ex|amined the matter, and finding the charge well &s;upported, I puni&s;hed each of the criminals with two dozen la&s;hes.</P>
<P>Their bows and arrows have not been mentioned before, nor were they often brought down to the fort: This day, however, Tubourai Tamaide brought down his, in con&s;e|quence of a challenge which he had received from Mr. Gore. The Chief &s;uppo&s;ed it was to try who could &s;end the arrow farthe&s;t; Mr. Gore, who be&s;t could hit a mark: and as Mr. Gore did not value him&s;elf upon &s;hooting to a great di&s;tance, nor the Chief upon hitting a mark, there was no trial of &s;kill between them. Tubourai Tamaide, however, to &s;hew us what he could do, drew his bow, and &s;ent an arrow, none of which are feathered, two hundred and &s;eventy-four yards, which is &s;omething more than a &s;eventh, and &s;omething le&s;s than a &s;ixth part of a mile. Their manner of &s;hooting is &s;omewhat &s;ingular; they kneel down, and the moment the arrow is di&s;charged, drop the bow.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks, in his morning walk this day, met a number of the natives whom, upon enquiry, he found to be travel|ling mu&s;icians; and having learnt where they were to be at night, we all repaired to the place. The band con&s;i&s;ted of
<PB N="148" REF="170">
two flutes and three drums,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Monday 12.</NOTE> and we found a great number of people a&s;&s;embled upon the occa&s;ion. The drummers ac|companied the mu&s;ick with their voices, and, to our great &s;urprize, we di&s;covered that we were generally the &s;ubject of the &s;ong. We did not expect to have found among the uncivilized inhabitants of this &s;eque&s;tered &s;pot, a character, which has been the &s;ubject of &s;uch prai&s;e and veneration where genius and knowlege have been mo&s;t con&s;picuous; yet the&s;e were the bards or min&s;trels of Otaheite. Their &s;ong was unpremeditated, and accompanied with mu&s;ick; they were continually going about from place to place, and they were rewarded by the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, and the au|dience, with &s;uch things as one wanted and the other could &s;pare.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE>On the 14th, we were brought into new difficulties and inconvenience by another robbery at the fort. In the middle of the night, one of the natives contrived to &s;teal an iron coal-rake, that was made u&s;e of for the oven. It happened to be &s;et up again&s;t the in&s;ide of the wall, &s;o that the top of the handle was vi&s;ible from without; and we were informed that the thief, who had been &s;een lurking there in the even|ing, came &s;ecretly about three o'clock in the morning, and, watching his opportunity when the centinel's back was turned, very dexterou&s;ly laid hold of it with a long crooked &s;tick, and drew it over the wall. I thought it of &s;ome con&s;e|quence, if po&s;&s;ible, to put an end to the&s;e practices at once, by doing &s;omething that &s;hould make it the common intere&s;t of the natives them&s;elves, to prevent them. I had given &s;trict orders that they &s;hould not be fired upon, even when detected in the&s;e attempts, for which I had many rea&s;ons: the common centinels were by no means fit to be entru&s;ted with a power of life and death, to be exerted whenever they &s;hould think fit, and I had already experienced that they
<PB N="149" REF="171">
were ready to take away the lives that were in their power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE> upon the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion; neither indeed did I think that the thefts which the&s;e people committed again&s;t us, were, in them, crimes worthy of death: that thieves are hanged in England, I thought no rea&s;on why they &s;hould be &s;hot in Otaheite; becau&s;e, with re&s;pect to the natives, it would have been an execution by a law <HI>ex po&s;t facto:</HI> they had no &s;uch law among them&s;elves, and it did not appear to me that we had any right to make &s;uch a law for them. That they &s;hould ab&s;tain from theft, or be puni&s;hed with death, was not one of the conditions under which they claimed the ad|vantages of civil &s;ociety, as it is among us; and as I was not willing to expo&s;e them to fire-arms, loaded with &s;hot, neither could I perfectly approve of firing only with powder: at fir&s;t, indeed, the noi&s;e and the &s;moke would alarm them, but when they found that no mi&s;chief followed, they would be led to de&s;pi&s;e the weapons them&s;elves, and proceed to in|&s;ults, which would make it nece&s;&s;ary to put them to the te&s;t, and from which they would be deterred by the very &s;ight of a gun, if it was never u&s;ed but with effect. At this time, an accident furni&s;hed me with what I thought a happy expe|dient. It happened that above twenty of their &s;ailing canoes were ju&s;t come in with a &s;upply of fi&s;h: upon the&s;e I imme|diately &s;eized, and bringing them into the river behind the fort, gave publick notice, that except the rake, and all the re&s;t of the things which from time to time had been &s;tolen, were returned, the canoes &s;hould be burnt. This menace I ventured to publi&s;h, though I had no de&s;ign to put it into execution, making no doubt but that it was well known in who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the &s;tolen goods were, and that as re&s;titution was thus made a common cau&s;e, they would all of them in a &s;hort time be brought back. A li&s;t of the things was made out, con&s;i&s;ting principally of the rake, the mu&s;quet which
<PB N="150" REF="172">
had been taken from the marine when the Indian was &s;hot;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Wedne&s;. 14.</NOTE> the pi&s;tols which Mr. Banks lo&s;t with his clothes at Atahou|rou; a &s;word belonging to one of the petty officers, and the water ca&s;k. About noon, the rake was re&s;tored, and great &s;olicitation was made for the relea&s;e of the canoes; but I &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon my original condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 15.</NOTE> The next day came, and nothing farther was re&s;tored, at which I was much &s;ur|pri&s;ed, for the people were in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s for the fi&s;h, which in a &s;hort time would be &s;poilt; I was, therefore, re|duced to a di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, either of relea&s;ing the ca|noes, contrary to what I had &s;olemnly and publickly declared, or to detain them, to the great injury of tho&s;e who were in|nocent, without an&s;wering any good purpo&s;e to our&s;elves: as a temporary expedient, I permitted them to take the fi&s;h; but &s;till detained the canoes. This very licence, however, was productive of new confu&s;ion and injury; for, it not being ea&s;y at once to di&s;tingui&s;h to what particular per&s;ons the &s;everal lots of fi&s;h belonged, the canoes were plundered, under favour of this circum&s;tance, by tho&s;e who had no right to any part of their cargo. Mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing in&s;tances were &s;till made that the canoes might be re&s;tored, and I having now the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe, either that the things for which I detained them were not in the i&s;land, or that tho&s;e who &s;uffered by their detention had not &s;ufficient influence over the thieves to prevail upon them to relinqui&s;h their booty, determined at length to give them up, not a little mortified at the bad &s;ucce&s;s of my project.</P>
<P>Another accident al&s;o about this time was, notwith&s;tand|ing all our caution, very near embroiling us with the In|dians. I &s;ent the boat on &s;hore with an officer to get balla&s;t for the &s;hip, and not immediately finding &s;tones convenient for the purpo&s;e, he began to pull down &s;ome part of an in|clo&s;ure where they depo&s;ited the bones of their dead: this
<PB N="151" REF="173">
the Indians violently oppo&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Thur&s;day 15.</NOTE> and a me&s;&s;enger came down to the tents to acquaint the officers that they would not &s;uffer it. Mr. Banks immediately repaired to the place, and an amicable end was &s;oon put to the di&s;pute, by &s;ending the boat's crew to the river, where &s;tones enough were to be gathered without a po&s;&s;ibility of giving offence. It is very remarkable, that the&s;e Indians appeared to be much more jealous of what was done to the dead than the living. This was the only mea&s;ure in which they ventured to oppo&s;e us, and the only in&s;ult that was offered to any individual among us was upon a &s;imilar occa&s;ion. Mr. Monkhou&s;e happening one day to pull a flower from a tree which grew in one of their &s;epulchral inclo&s;ures, an Indian, who&s;e jealou&s;y had probably been upon the watch, came &s;uddenly behind him, and &s;truck him: Mr. Monkhou&s;e laid hold of him, but he was in&s;tantly re&s;cued by two more, who took hold of Mr. Monkhou&s;e's hair, and forced him to quit his hold of their companion, and then ran away without offering him any farther violence.</P>
<P>In the evening of the 19th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday. 19.</NOTE> while the canoes were &s;till de|tained, we received a vi&s;it from Oberea, which &s;urpri&s;ed us not a little, as &s;he brought with her none of the things that had been &s;tolen, and knew that &s;he was &s;u&s;pected of having &s;ome of them in her cu&s;tody. She &s;aid indeed, that her fa|vourite Obadee, whom &s;he had beaten and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, had taken them away; but &s;he &s;eemed con&s;cious, that &s;he had no right to be believed: &s;he di&s;covered the &s;tronge&s;t &s;igns of fear, yet &s;he &s;urmounted it with a&s;toni&s;hing re&s;olution; and was very pre&s;&s;ing to &s;leep with her attendants in Mr. Banks's tent. In this, however, &s;he was not gratified; the affair of the jackets was too recent, and the tent was be&s;ides filled with other people. No body el&s;e &s;eemed willing to entertain
<PB N="152" REF="174">
her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June.</NOTE> and &s;he therefore, with great appearance of mortifica|tion and di&s;appointment, &s;pent the night in her canoe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 20.</NOTE>The next morning early, &s;he returned to the fort, with her canoe and every thing that it contained, putting her&s;elf wholly into our power, with &s;omething like greatne&s;s of mind, which excited our wonder and admiration. As the mo&s;t ef|fectual means to bring about a reconciliation, &s;he pre&s;ented us with a hog, and &s;everal other things, among which was a dog. We had lately learnt, that the&s;e animals were e&s;teemed by the Indians as more delicate food than their pork; and upon this occa&s;ion we determined to try the experiment: the dog, which was very fat, we con&s;igned over to Tupia, who undertook to perform the double office of butcher and cook. He killed him by holding his hands clo&s;e over his mouth and no&s;e, an operation which continued above a quarter of an hour. While this was doing, a hole was made in the ground about a foot deep, in which a fire was kindled, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;tones placed in layers alternately with the wood to heat; the dog was then &s;inged, by holding him over the fire, and, by &s;craping him with a &s;hell, the hair taken off as clean as if he had been &s;calded in hot water: he was then cut up with the &s;ame in&s;trument, and his entrails being taken out, were &s;ent to the &s;ea, where being carefully wa&s;hed, they were put into cocoa-nut &s;hells, with what blood had come from the body: when the hole was &s;ufficiently heated, the fire was taken out, and &s;ome of the &s;tones, which were not &s;o hot as to di&s;colour any thing that they touched, being placed at the bottom, were covered with green leaves: the dog, with the entrails, was then placed upon the leaves, and other leaves being laid upon them, the whole was covered with the re&s;t of the hot &s;tones, and the mouth of the hole clo&s;e &s;topped with mould: in &s;omewhat le&s;s than four hours it
<PB N="153" REF="175">
was again opened, and the dog taken out excellently baked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Tue&s;day 20.</NOTE> and we all agreed that he made a very good di&s;h. The dogs which are here bred to be eaten, ta&s;te no animal food, but are kept wholly upon bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, yams, and other vegetables of the like kind: all the fle&s;h and fi&s;h eaten by the inhabitants is dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t, we were vi&s;ited at the fort by a Chief,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 21.</NOTE> called OAMO, whom we had never &s;een before, and who was treated by the natives with uncommon re&s;pect; he brought with him a boy about &s;even years old, and a young woman about &s;ixteen: the boy was carried upon a man's back, which we con&s;idered as a piece of &s;tate, for he was as well able to walk as any pre&s;ent. As &s;oon as they were in &s;ight, Oberea, and &s;everal other natives who were in the fort, went out to meet them, having fir&s;t uncovered their heads and bodies as low as the wai&s;t: as they came on, the &s;ame ceremony was per|formed by all the natives who were without the fort. Un|covering the body, therefore, is in this country probably a mark of re&s;pect; and as all parts are here expo&s;ed with equal indifference, the ceremony of uncovering it from the wai&s;t downwards, which was performed by Oorattooa, might be nothing more than a different mode of compliment, adapted to per&s;ons of a different rank. The Chief came into the tent, but no entreaty could prevail upon the young woman to fol|low him, though &s;he &s;eemed to refu&s;e contrary to her inclina|tion: the natives without were indeed all very &s;olicitous to prevent her; &s;ometimes, when her re&s;olution &s;eemed to fail, almo&s;t u&s;ing force: the boy al&s;o they re&s;trained in the &s;ame manner; but Dr. Solander happening to meet him at the gate, took him by the hand, and led him in before the people were aware of it: as &s;oon, however, as tho&s;e that were within &s;aw him, they took care to have him &s;ent out.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="176"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Wedne&s;. 21.</NOTE>The&s;e circum&s;tances having &s;trongly excited our curio&s;ity, we enquired who they were, and were informed, that Oamo was the hu&s;band of Oberea, though they had been a long time &s;eparated by mutual con&s;ent; and that the young wo|man and the boy were their children. We learnt al&s;o, that the boy, who&s;e name was TERRIDIRI, was heir apparent to the &s;overeignty of the i&s;land, and that his &s;i&s;ter was intended for his wife, the marriage being deferred only till he &s;hould arrive at a proper age. The &s;overeign at this time was a &s;on of WHAPPAI, who&s;e name was OUTOU, and who, as before has been ob&s;erved, was a minor. Whappai, Oamo, and Too|tahah, were brothers: Whappai was the elde&s;t, and Oamo the &s;econd; &s;o that, Whappai having no child but Outou, Terri|diri, the &s;on of his next brother Oamo, was heir to the &s;ove|reignty. It will, perhaps, &s;eem &s;trange that a boy &s;hould be &s;overeign during the life of his father; but, according to the cu&s;tom of the country, a child &s;ucceeds to a father's title and authority as &s;oon as it is born: a regent is then elected, and the father of the new &s;overeign is generally continued in his authority, under that title, till his child is of age; but, at this time, the choice had fallen upon Tootahah, the uncle, in con&s;equence of his having di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in a war. Oamo a&s;ked many que&s;tions concerning England and its in|habitants, by which he appeared to have great &s;hrewdne&s;s and under&s;tanding.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> An Account of the Circumnavigation of the I&s;land, and various Incidents that happened during the Expedition; with a De&s;cription of a Burying-place and Place of Wor&s;hip, called a Morai.</HEAD>
<P>ON Monday the 26th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Monday 26.</NOTE> about three o'clock in the morn|ing, I &s;et out in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks, to make the circuit of the i&s;land, with a view to &s;ketch out the coa&s;t and harbours. We took our route to the ea&s;tward, and about eight in the forenoon we went on &s;hore, in a di&s;trict called OAHOUNUE, which is governed by AHIO, a young Chief, whom we had often &s;een at the tents, and who favoured us with his company to breakfa&s;t. Here al&s;o we found two other natives of our old acquaintance, TITUBOALO and HOONA, who carried us to their hou&s;es, near which we &s;aw the body of the old woman, at who&s;e funeral rites Mr. Banks had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and which had been removed hither from the &s;pot where it was fir&s;t depo&s;ited, this place having de|&s;cended from her by inheritance to Hoona, and it being ne|ce&s;&s;ary on that account that it &s;hould lie here. We then proceeded on foot, the boat attending within call, to the harbour in which Mr. Bougainville lay, called OHIDEA, where the natives &s;hewed us the ground upon which his people pitched their tent, and the brook at which they wa|tered, though no trace of them remained, except the holes where the poles of the tent had been fixed, and a &s;mall piece of pot&s;heard, which Mr. Banks found in looking narrowly about the &s;pot. We met, however, with ORETTE, a Chief
<PB N="156" REF="178">
who was their principal friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Monday 26.</NOTE> and who&s;e brother OUTOR|ROU went away with them.</P>
<P>This harbour lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of a great bay, under &s;helter of a &s;mall i&s;land called BOOUROU, near which is ano|ther called TAAWIRRII; the breach in the reefs is here very large, but the &s;helter for the &s;hips is not the be&s;t.</P>
<P>Soon after we had examined this place, we took boat, and a&s;ked Tituboalo to go with us to the other &s;ide of the bay; but he refu&s;ed, and advi&s;ed us not to go, for he &s;aid the country there was inhabited by people who were not &s;ubject to Tootahah, and who would kill both him and us. Upon receiving this intelligence, we did not, as may be imagined, relinqui&s;h our enterprize; but we immediately loaded our pieces with ball: this was &s;o well under&s;tood by Tituboalo as a precaution which rendered us formidable, that he now con&s;ented to be of our party.</P>
<P>Having rowed till it was dark, we reached a low neck of land, or i&s;thmus, at the bottom of the bay, that divides the i&s;land into two penin&s;ulas, each of which is a di&s;trict or go|vernment wholly independent of the other. From Port-Royal, where the &s;hip was at anchor, the coa&s;t trends E. by S. and E. S. E. ten miles, then S. by E. and S. eleven miles to the i&s;thmus. In the fir&s;t direction, the &s;hore is in general open to the &s;ea; but in the la&s;t it is covered by reefs of rocks, which form &s;everal good harbours, with &s;afe anchorage, in 16, 18, 20, and 24 fathom of water, with other conveniences. As we had not yet got into our enemy's country, we deter|mined to &s;leep on &s;hore: we landed, and though we found but few hou&s;es, we &s;aw &s;everal double canoes who&s;e own|ers were well known to us, and who provided us with &s;up|per and lodging; of which Mr. Banks was indebted for his
<PB N="157" REF="179">
&s;hare to Ooratooa,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June.</NOTE> the lady who had paid him her compli|ments in &s;o &s;ingular a manner at the fort.</P>
<P>In the morning, we looked about the country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 27.</NOTE> and found it to be a mar&s;hy flat, about two miles over, acro&s;s which the natives haul their canoes to the corre&s;ponding bay on the other &s;ide. We then prepared to continue our rout for what Tituboalo called the other kingdom; he &s;aid that the name of it was TIARRABOU, or OTAHEITE ETE; and that of the Chief who governed it, WAHEATUA: upon this occa&s;ion al&s;o, we learnt that the name of the penin&s;ula where we had taken our &s;tation was OPOUREONU, or OTAHEITE NUE. Our new a&s;&s;ociate &s;eemed to be now in better &s;pirits than he had been the day before; the people in Tiarrabou would not kill us, he &s;aid, but he a&s;&s;ured us that we &s;hould be able to pro|cure no victuals among them; and indeed we had &s;een no bread-fruit &s;ince we &s;et out.</P>
<P>After rowing a few miles, we landed in a di&s;trict, which was the dominion of a Chief called MARAITATA, the bury|ing-place of men; who&s;e father's name was PAHAIREDO, the &s;tealer of boats. Though the&s;e names &s;eemed to favour the account that had been given by Tituboalo, we &s;oon found that it was not true. Both the father and the &s;on received us with the greate&s;t civility, gave us provi&s;ions, and, after &s;ome delay, &s;old us a very large hog for a hatchet. A crowd &s;oon gathered round us, but we &s;aw only two people that we knew; neither did we ob&s;erve a &s;ingle bead or ornament among them that had come from our &s;hip, though we &s;aw &s;everal things which had been brought from Europe. In one of the hou&s;es lay two twelve-pound &s;hot, one of which was marked with the broad arrow of England, though the people &s;aid they had them from the &s;hips that lay in Bougainville's harbour.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="180"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Tue&s;day 27.</NOTE>We proceeded on foot till we came to the di&s;trict which was immediately under the government of the principal Chief, or King of the penin&s;ula, Waheatua. Waheatua had a &s;on, but whether, according to the cu&s;tom of Opou|reonu, he admini&s;tered the government as regent, or in his own right, is uncertain. This di&s;trict con&s;i&s;ts of a large and fertile plain, watered by a river &s;o wide, that we were obliged to ferry over it in a canoe; our Indian train, how|ever, cho&s;e to &s;wim, and took to the water with the &s;ame facility as a pack of hounds. In this place we &s;aw no hou&s;e that appeared to be inhabited, but the ruins of many, that had been very large. We proceeded along the &s;hore, which forms a bay, called OAITIPEHA, and at la&s;t we found the Chief &s;itting near &s;ome pretty canoe awnings, under which, we &s;uppo&s;ed, he and his attendants &s;lept. He was a thin old man, with a very white head and beard, and had with him a comely woman, about five and twenty years old, who&s;e name was TOUDIDDE. We had often heard the name of this woman, and, from report and ob&s;ervation, we had rea&s;on to think that &s;he was the OBEREA of this penin&s;ula. From this place, between which and the i&s;thmus there are other harbours, formed by the reefs that lie along the &s;hore, where &s;hipping may lie in perfect &s;ecurity, and from whence the land trends S. S. E. and S. to the S. E. part of the i&s;land, we were accompanied by TEAREE, the &s;on of Waheatua, of whom we had purcha&s;ed a hog, and the country we pa&s;&s;ed through appeared to be more cultivated than any we had &s;een in other parts of the i&s;land: the brooks were every where banked into narrow channels with &s;tone, and the &s;hore had al&s;o a facing of &s;tone, where it was wa&s;hed by the &s;ea. The hou&s;es were neither large nor numerous, but the canoes that were hauled up along the &s;hore were almo&s;t innumerable, and &s;uperior to any that we had &s;een before, both in &s;ize and
<PB N="159" REF="181">
make; they were longer, the &s;terns were higher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Tue&s;day 27.</NOTE> and the awnings were &s;upported by pillars. At almo&s;t every point there was a &s;epulchral building, and there were many of them al&s;o in land. They were of the &s;ame figure as tho&s;e in Opoureonu, but they were cleaner and better kept, and deco|rated with many carved boards, which were &s;et upright, and on the top of which were various figures of birds and men: on one in particular, there was the repre&s;entation of a cock, which was painted red and yellow, to imitate the fea|thers of that animal, and rude images of men were, in &s;ome of them, placed one upon the head of another. But in this part of the country, however fertile and cultivated, we did not &s;ee a &s;ingle bread-fruit; the trees were entirely bare, and the inhabitants &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t principally upon nuts which are not unlike a che&s;nut, and which they call <HI>Ahee.</HI></P>
<P>When we had walked till we were weary, we called up the boat, but both our Indians, Tituboalo and Tuahow, were mi&s;&s;ing: they had, it &s;eems, &s;tayed behind at Waheatua's, ex|pecting us to return thither, in con&s;equence of a promi&s;e which had been extorted from us, and which we had it not in our power to fulfil.</P>
<P>Tearee, however, and another, embarked with us, and we proceeded till we came a-brea&s;t of a &s;mall i&s;land called OTOOAREITE; it being then dark, we determined to land, and our Indians conducted us to a place where they &s;aid we might &s;leep: it was a de&s;erted hou&s;e, and near it was a little cove, in which the boat might lie with great &s;afety and con|venience. We were, however, in want of provi&s;ions, having been very &s;paringly &s;upplied &s;ince we &s;et out; and Mr. Banks immediately went into the woods to &s;ee whether any could be procured. As it was dark; he met with no people, and could find but one hou&s;e that was inhabited: a bread-fruit
<PB N="160" REF="182">
and a half,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Tue&s;day 27.</NOTE> a few Ahees, and &s;ome fire, were all that it afforded; upon which, with a duck or two, and a few curlieus, we made our &s;upper, which, if not &s;canty, was di&s;agreeable, by the want of bread, with which we had neglected to furni&s;h our&s;elves, as we depended upon meeting with bread-fruit, and took up our lodging under the awning of a canoe belonging to Tearee, which followed us.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 28.</NOTE>The next morning, after having &s;pent &s;ome time in an|other fruitle&s;s attempt to procure a &s;upply of provi&s;ions, we proceeded round the &s;outh ea&s;t point, part of which is not covered by any reef, but lies open to the &s;ea; and here the hill ri&s;es directly from the &s;hore. At the &s;outhermo&s;t part of the i&s;land, the &s;hore is again covered by a reef, which forms a good harbour; and the land about it is very fertile. We made this rout partly on foot and partly in the boat: when we had walked about three miles, we arrived at a place where we &s;aw &s;everal large canoes, and a number of people with them, whom we were agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find were of our intimate acquaintance. Here, with much difficulty, we procured &s;ome cocoa-nuts, and then embarked, taking with us Tuahow, one of the Indians who had waited for us at Waheatua's, and had returned the night before, long after it was dark.</P>
<P>When we came a-brea&s;t of the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, we went a&s;hore, by the advice of our Indian guide, who told us that the country was rich and good. The Chief, who&s;e name was MATHIABO, &s;oon came down to us, but &s;eemed to be a total &s;tranger both to us and to our trade: his &s;ub|jects, however, brought us plenty of cocoa-nuts, and about twenty bread-fruit. The bread-fruit we bought at a very dear rate, but his excellency &s;old us a pig for a gla&s;s bottle, which he preferred to every thing el&s;e that we could give
<PB N="161" REF="183">
him. We found in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a goo&s;e and a turkey-cock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Wedne&s;. 28.</NOTE> which, we were informed, had been left upon the i&s;land by the Dolphin: they were both enormou&s;ly fat, and &s;o tame that they followed the Indians, who were fond of them to exce&s;s, wherever they went.</P>
<P>In a long hou&s;e in this neighbourhood, we &s;aw what was altogether new to us. At one end of it, fa&s;tened to a &s;emi|circular board, hung fifteen human jaw-bones; they ap|peared to be fre&s;h, and there was not one of them that wanted a &s;ingle tooth. A &s;ight &s;o extraordinary, &s;trongly ex|cited our curio&s;ity, and we made many enquiries about it; but at this time could get no information, for the people either could not, or would not under&s;tand us.</P>
<P>When we left this place, the Chief, Mathiabo, de&s;ired leave to accompany us, which was readily granted. He continued with us the remainder of the day, and proved very u&s;eful, by piloting us over the &s;hoals. In the evening, we opened the bay on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, which an&s;wered to that on the &s;outh ea&s;t, &s;o as at the i&s;thmus, or carrying-place, almo&s;t to inter&s;ect the i&s;land, as I have ob&s;erved before; and when we had coa&s;ted about two-thirds of it, we determined to go on &s;hore for the night. We &s;aw a large hou&s;e at &s;ome di&s;tance, which, Mathiabo informed us, be|longed to one of his friends; and &s;oon after &s;everal canoes came off to meet us, having on board &s;ome very hand&s;ome women, who, by their behaviour, &s;eemed to have been &s;ent to entice us on &s;hore. As we had before re&s;olved to take up our re&s;idence here for the night, little invitation was nece&s;|&s;ary. We found that the hou&s;e belonged to the Chief of the di&s;trict, who&s;e name was WIVEROU; he received us in a very friendly manner, and ordered his people to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in dre&s;&s;ing our provi&s;ion, of which we had now got a tolerable
<PB N="162" REF="184">
&s;tock.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Wedne&s;. 28.</NOTE> When our &s;upper was ready, we were conducted into that part of the hou&s;e where Wiverou was &s;itting, in order to eat it; Mathiabo &s;upped with us, and Wiverou calling for his &s;upper at the &s;ame time, we eat our meal very &s;ociably, and with great good-humour. When it was over, we began to enquire where we were to &s;leep, and a part of the hou&s;e was &s;hewn us, of which we were told we might take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion for that purpo&s;e. We then &s;ent for our cloaks, and Mr. Banks began to undre&s;s, as his cu&s;tom was, and, with a pre|caution which he had been taught by the lo&s;s of the jackets at Atahourou, &s;ent his clothes aboard the boat, propo&s;ing to cover him&s;elf with a piece of Indian cloth. When Mathiabo perceived what was doing, he al&s;o pretended to want a cloak; and, as he had behaved very well, and done us &s;ome &s;ervice, a cloak was ordered for him. We lay down, and ob&s;erved that Mathiabo was not with us; but we &s;uppo&s;ed that he was gone to bathe, as the Indians always do before they &s;leep. We had not waited long, however, when an In|dian, who was a &s;tranger to us, came and told Mr. Banks, that the cloak and Mathiabo had di&s;appeared together. This man had &s;o far gained our confidence, that we did not at fir&s;t believe the report; but it being &s;oon after confirmed by Tuahow, our own Indian, we knew no time was to be lo&s;t. As it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to pur&s;ue the thief with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the people about us, Mr. Banks &s;tarted up, and telling our ca&s;e, required them to re|cover the cloak; and to enforce his requi&s;ition, &s;hewed one of his pocket pi&s;tols, which he always kept about him. Upon the &s;ight of the pi&s;tol, the whole company took the alarm, and, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting to catch the thief, or recover what had been &s;tolen, began with great precipitation to leave the place; one of them, however, was &s;eized, upon which he immediately offered to direct the chace: I &s;et out there|fore
<PB N="163" REF="185">
with Mr. Banks, and though we ran all the way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Wedne&s;. 28.</NOTE> the alarm had got before us, for in about ten minutes we met a man bringing back the cloak, which the thief had relin|qui&s;hed in great terror; and as we did not then think fit to continue the pur&s;uit, he made his e&s;cape. When we returned, we found the hou&s;e, in which there had been between two and three hundred people, entirely de&s;erted. It being, however, &s;oon known that we had no re&s;entment again&s;t any body but Mathiabo, the Chief Wiverou, our ho&s;t, with his wife and many others, returned, and took up their lodg|ing with us for the night. In this place, however, we were de&s;tined to more confu&s;ion and trouble, for about five o'clock in the morning our &s;entry alarmed us, with an account that the boat was mi&s;&s;ing: he had &s;een her, he &s;aid, about half an hour before, at her grappling, which was not above fifty yards from the &s;hore; but upon hearing the &s;ound of oars, he had looked out again, and could &s;ee nothing of her. At this account we &s;tarted up greatly alarmed, and ran to the water &s;ide: the morning was clear and &s;tar light, &s;o that we could &s;ee to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, but there was no ap|pearance of the boat. Our &s;ituation was now &s;uch as might ju&s;tify the mo&s;t terrifying apprehen&s;ions; as it was a dead calm, and we could not therefore &s;uppo&s;e her to have broken from her grappling, we had great rea&s;on to fear that the Indians had attacked her, and finding the people a&s;leep, had &s;ucceeded in their enterprize: we were but four, with only one mu&s;quet and two pocket pi&s;tols, without a &s;pare ball or charge of powder for either. In this &s;tate of anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s we remained a con&s;iderable time, expecting the Indians every moment to improve their advantage, when, to our un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction, we &s;aw the boat return, which had been driven from her grappling by the tide; a cir|cum&s;tance
<PB N="164" REF="186">
to which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June.</NOTE> in our confu&s;ion and &s;urpri&s;e, we did not advert.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 29.</NOTE>As &s;oon as the boat returned, we got our breakfa&s;t, and were impatient to leave the place, le&s;t &s;ome other vexatious accident &s;hould befal us. It is &s;ituated on the north &s;ide of Tiarrabou, the &s;outh ea&s;t penin&s;ula, or divi&s;ion, of the i&s;land, and at the di&s;tance of about five miles &s;outh ea&s;t from the i&s;thmus, having a large and commodious harbour, infe|rior to none in the i&s;land, about which the land is very rich in produce. Notwith&s;tanding we had had little communica|tion with this divi&s;ion, the inhabitants every where received us in a friendly manner; we found the whole of it fertile and populous, and, to all appearance, in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate than Opoureonu, though it is not above one fourth part as large.</P>
<P>The next di&s;trict in which we landed, was the la&s;t in Ti|arrabou, and governed by a Chief, who&s;e name we under|&s;tood to be OMOE. Omoe was building a hou&s;e, and being therefore very de&s;irous of procuring a hatchet, he would have been glad to have purcha&s;ed one with any thing that he had in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it happened, however, rather unfor|tunately for him and us, that we had not one hatchet left in the boat. We offered to trade with nails, but he would not part with any thing in exchange for them; we therefore re|imbarked, and put off our boat, but the Chief being unwil|ling to relinqui&s;h all hope of obtaining &s;omething from us that would be of u&s;e to him, embarked in a canoe, with his wife WHANNO-OUDA, and followed us. After &s;ome time, we took them into the boat, and when we had rowed about a league, they de&s;ired we would put a&s;hore: we immediately complied with his reque&s;t, and found &s;ome of his people
<PB N="165" REF="187">
who had brought down a very large hog.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Thur&s;day 29.</NOTE> We were as un|willing to lo&s;e the hog, as the Chief was to part with us, and it was indeed worth the be&s;t axe we had in the &s;hip; we there|fore hit upon an expedient, and told him, that if he would bring his hog to the fort at MATAVAI, the Indian name for Port Royal bay, he &s;hould have a large axe, and a nail into the bargain, for his trouble. To this propo&s;al, after having con&s;ulted with his wife, he agreed, and gave us a large piece of his country cloth as a pledge that he would perform, his agreement, which, however, he never did.</P>
<P>At this place we &s;aw a very &s;ingular curio&s;ity: it was the figure of a man, con&s;tructed of ba&s;ket work, rudely made, but not ill de&s;igned; it was &s;omething more than &s;even feet high, and rather too bulky in proportion to its height. The wicker &s;keleton was completely covered with feathers, which were white where the &s;kin was to appear, and black in the parts which it is their cu&s;tom to paint or &s;tain, and upon the head, where there was to be a repre&s;entation of hair: upon the head al&s;o were four protuberances, three in front and one behind, which we &s;hould have called horns, but which the Indians dignified with the name of TATE ETE, little men. The image was called MANIOE, and was &s;aid to be the only one of the kind in Otaheite. They attempted to give us an explanation of its u&s;e and de&s;ign, but we had not then acquired enough of their language to under&s;tand them. We learnt, however, afterwards, that it was a repre&s;entation of Mauwe, one of their Eatuas, or gods of the &s;econd cla&s;s.</P>
<P>After having &s;ettled our affairs with Omoe, we proceeded on our return, and &s;oon reached Opoureonu, the north-we&s;t penin&s;ula. After rowing a few miles, we went on &s;hore again, but the only thing we &s;aw worth notice, was a repo|&s;itory for the dead, uncommonly decorated: the pavement
<PB N="166" REF="188">
was extremely neat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Thur&s;day 29.</NOTE> and upon it was rai&s;ed a pyramid, about five feet high, which was intirely covered with the fruits of two plants, peculiar to the country. Near the pyramid was a &s;mall image of &s;tone, of very rude workman&s;hip, and the fir&s;t in&s;tance of carving in &s;tone that we had &s;een among the&s;e people. They appeared to &s;et a high value upon it, for it was covered from the weather by a &s;hed, that had been erected on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We proceeded in the boat, and pa&s;&s;ed through the only harbour, on the &s;outh &s;ide of Opoureonu, that is fit for &s;hip|ping. It is &s;ituated about five miles to the we&s;tward of the i&s;thmus, between two &s;mall i&s;lands that lie near the &s;hore, and about a mile di&s;tant from each other, and affords good anchorage in eleven and twelve fathom water. We were now not far from the di&s;trict called PAPARRA, which belonged to our friends Oamo and Oberea, where we propo&s;ed to &s;leep. We went on &s;hore about an hour before night, and found that they were both ab&s;ent, having left their habitations to pay us a vi&s;it at Matavai: this, however, did not alter our purpo&s;e, we took up our quarters at the hou&s;e of Oberea, which, though &s;mall, was very neat, and at this time had no inhabitant but her father, who received us with looks that bid us welcome. Having taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we were willing to improve the little day-light that was left us, and therefore walked out to a point, upon which we had &s;een, at a di&s;tance, trees that are here called <HI>Etoa,</HI> which generally di&s;tingui&s;h the places where the&s;e people bury the bones of their dead: their name for &s;uch burying-grounds, which are al&s;o places of wor&s;hip, is MORAI. We were &s;oon &s;truck with the &s;ight of an enormous pile, which, we were told, was the Morai of Oamo and Oberea, and the principal piece of Indian architecture in the i&s;land. It was a pile of &s;tone work, rai&s;ed pyramidically, upon an oblong ba&s;e, or &s;quare,
<PB N="167" REF="189">
two hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even feet long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Thur&s;day 29.</NOTE> and eighty-&s;even wide. It was built like the &s;mall pyramidal mounts upon which we &s;ometimes fix the pillar of a &s;un-dial, where each &s;ide is a flight of &s;teps; the &s;teps, however, at the &s;ides, were broader than tho&s;e at the ends, &s;o that it terminated not in a &s;quare of the &s;ame figure with the ba&s;e, but in a ridge, like the roof of a hou&s;e: there were eleven of the&s;e &s;teps, each of which was four feet high, &s;o that the height of the pile was forty-four feet; each &s;tep was formed of one cour&s;e of white coral &s;tone, which was neatly &s;quared and poli&s;hed, the re&s;t of the ma&s;s, for there was no hollow within, con&s;i&s;ted of round pebbles, which, from the regularity of their figure, &s;eemed to have been wrought. Some of the coral &s;tones were very large; we mea&s;ured one of them, and found it three feet and an half by two feet and an half. The foun|dation was of rock &s;tones, which were al&s;o &s;quared; and one of them mea&s;ured four feet &s;even inches by two feet four. Such a &s;tructure, rai&s;ed without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of iron tools to &s;hape the &s;tones, or mortar to join them, &s;truck us with a&s;toni&s;hment: it &s;eemed to be as compact and firm as it could have been made by any workman in Europe, except that the &s;teps, which range along its greate&s;t length, are not per|fectly &s;trait, but &s;ink in a kind of hollow in the middle, &s;o that the whole &s;urface, from end to end, is not a right line, but a curve. The quarry &s;tones, as we &s;aw no quarry in the neighbourhood, mu&s;t have been brought from a con&s;iderable di&s;tance; and there is no method of conveyance here but by hand: the coral mu&s;t al&s;o have been fi&s;hed from under the water, where, though it may be found in plenty, it lies at a con&s;iderable depth, never le&s;s than three feet. Both the rock &s;tone and the coral could be &s;quared only by tools made of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance, which mu&s;t have been a work of incredible labour; but the poli&s;hing was more ea&s;ily
<PB N="168" REF="190">
effected by means of the &s;harp coral &s;and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Thur&s;day 29.</NOTE> which is found every where upon the &s;ea-&s;hore in great abundance. In the middle of the top &s;tood the image of a bird, carved in wood; and near it lay the broken one of a fi&s;h, carved in &s;tone. The whole of this pyramid made part of one &s;ide of a &s;pa|cious area or &s;quare, nearly of equal &s;ides, being three hun|dred and &s;ixty feet by three hundred and fifty-four, which was walled in with &s;tone, and paved with flat &s;tones in its whole extent; though there were growing in it, notwith|&s;tanding the pavement, &s;everal of the trees which they call <HI>Etoa,</HI> and plantains. About an hundred yards to the we&s;t of this building, was another paved area or court, in which were &s;everal &s;mall &s;tages rai&s;ed on wooden pillars, about &s;even feet high, which are called by the Indians <HI>Ewattas,</HI> and &s;eem to be a kind of altars, as upon the&s;e are placed provi&s;ions of all kinds as offerings to their gods; we have &s;ince &s;een whole hogs placed upon them, and we found here the &s;culls of above fifty, be&s;ides the &s;culls of a great number of dogs.</P>
<P>The principal object of ambition among the&s;e people is to have a magnificent Morai, and this was a &s;triking memorial of the rank and power of Oberea. It has been remarked, that we did not find her inve&s;ted with the &s;ame authority that &s;he exerci&s;ed when the Dolphin was at this place, and we now learnt the rea&s;on of it. Our way from her hou&s;e to the Morai lay along the &s;ea &s;ide, and we ob&s;erved every where under our feet a great number of human bones, chiefly ribs and vertebrae. Upon enquiring into the cau&s;e of &s;o &s;ingular an appearance, we were told, that in the then la&s;t month of <HI>Owarahew,</HI> which an&s;wered to our December, 1768, about four or five months before our arrival, the people of Tiarrabou, the S. E. penin&s;ula which we had ju&s;t vi&s;ited, made a de&s;cent at this place, and killed a great number of people, who&s;e bones were tho&s;e that we &s;aw upon the &s;hore:
<PB N="169" REF="191">
that, upon this occa&s;ion, Oberea, and Oamo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. June. Thur&s;day 29.</NOTE> who then admi|ni&s;tered the government for his &s;on, had fled to the moun|tains; and that the conquerors burnt all the hou&s;es, which were very large, and carried away the hogs and what other animals they found. We learnt al&s;o, that the turkey and goo&s;e, which we had &s;een when we were with Mathiabo, the &s;tealer of cloaks, were among the &s;poils; this accounted for their being found among people with whom the Dolphin had little or no communication; and upon mentioning the jaw-bones, which we had &s;een hanging from a board in a long hou&s;e, we were told, that they al&s;o had been carried away as trophies, the people here carrying away the jaw-bones of their enemies, as the Indians of North America do the &s;calps.</P>
<P>After having thus gratified our curio&s;ity, we returned to our quarters, where we pa&s;&s;ed the night in perfect &s;ecurity and quiet. By the next evening we arrived at Atahourou,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 30.</NOTE> the re&s;idence of our friend Tootahah, where, the la&s;t time we pa&s;&s;ed the night under his protection, we had been ob|liged to leave the be&s;t part of our clothes behind us. This adventure, however, &s;eemed now to be forgotten on both &s;ides. Our friends received us with great plea&s;ure, and gave us a good &s;upper and a good lodging, where we &s;uffered neither lo&s;s or di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>The next day, Saturday, July the 1&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July. Saturday 1.</NOTE> we got back to our fort at Matavai, having found the circuit of the i&s;land, in|cluding both penin&s;ulas, to be about thirty leagues. Upon our complaining of the want of bread-fruit, we were told, that the produce of the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on was nearly exhau&s;ted; and that what was &s;een &s;prouting upon the trees, would not be fit to u&s;e in le&s;s than three months; this accounted for our hav|ing been able to procure &s;o little of it in our route.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="192"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Saturday 1.</NOTE>While the bread-fruit is ripening upon the flats, the in|habitants are &s;upplied in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the trees which they have planted upon the hills to pre&s;erve a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but the quantity is not &s;ufficient to prevent &s;carcity: they live therefore upon the four pa&s;te which they call <HI>Mahie,</HI> upon wild plantains, and ahee-nuts, which at this time are in perfection. How it happened that the Dolphin, which was here at this &s;ea&s;on, found &s;uch plenty of bread-fruit upon the trees, I cannot tell, except the &s;ea&s;on in which they ripen varies.</P>
<P>At our return, our Indian friends crouded about us, and none of them came empty-handed. Though I had deter|mined to re&s;tore the canoes which had been detained to their owners, it had not yet been done; but I now relea&s;ed them as they were applied for. Upon this occa&s;ion I could not but remark with concern, that the&s;e people were capable of practi&s;ing petty frauds again&s;t each other, with a delibe|rate di&s;hone&s;ty, which gave me a much wor&s;e opinion of them than I had ever entertained from the robberies they committed under the &s;trong temptation to which a &s;udden opportunity of enriching them&s;elves with the ine&s;timable metal and manufactures of Europe expo&s;ed them.</P>
<P>Among others who applied to me for the relea&s;e of a ca|noe, was one POTATTOW, a man of &s;ome con&s;equence, well known to us all. I con&s;ented, &s;uppo&s;ing the ve&s;&s;el to be his own, or that he applied on the behalf of a friend: he went immediately to the beach, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the boats, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his people, he began to carry off. Upon this, however, it was eagerly claimed by the right owners, who, &s;upported by the other Indians, clamour|ou&s;ly reproached him for invading their property, and pre|pared to take the canoe from him by force. Upon this, he
<PB N="171" REF="193">
de&s;ired to be heard, and told them, that the canoe did,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Saturday 1.</NOTE> in|deed, once belong to tho&s;e who claimed it; but that I, hav|ing &s;eized it as a forfeit, had &s;old it to him for a pig. This &s;ilenced the clamour, the owners, knowing that from my power there was no appeal, acquie&s;ced; and Potattow would have carried off his prize, if the di&s;pute had not fortunately been overheard by &s;ome of our people who reported it to me. I gave orders immediately that the Indians &s;hould be unde|ceived; upon which the right owners took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their canoe, and Potattow was &s;o con&s;cious of his guilt, that nei|ther he nor his wife, who was privy to his knavery, could look us in the face for &s;ome time afterwards.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> An Expedition of Mr. Banks to trace the River: Marks of &s;ubterraneous Fire: Preparations for leaving the I&s;land: An Account of Tupai.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Monday 3.</NOTE>ON the 3d, Mr. Banks fet out early in the morning, with &s;ome Indian guides, to trace our river up the valley from which it i&s;&s;ues, and examine how far it's banks were inhabited. For about &s;ix miles they met with hou&s;es, not far di&s;tant from each other, on each &s;ide of the river, and the valley was every where about four hundred yards wide from the foot of the hill on one &s;ide, to the foot of that on the other; but they were now &s;hewn a hou&s;e which they were told was the la&s;t that they would &s;ee. When they came up to it, the ma&s;ter of it offered them refre&s;hments of cocoa-nuts and other fruit, of which they accepted; after a &s;hort &s;tay, they walked forward for a con&s;iderable time; in bad way it is not ea&s;y to compute di&s;tances, but they imagined that they had walked about &s;ix miles farther, following the cour&s;e of the river, when they frequently pa&s;&s;ed under vaults, formed by fragments of the rock, in which they were told people who were benighted frequently pa&s;&s;ed the night. Soon after they found the river banked by &s;teep rocks, from which a ca&s;cade, falling with great violence, formed a pool, &s;o &s;teep, that the Indians &s;aid they could not pa&s;s it. They &s;eemed, indeed, not much to be acquainted with the valley beyond this place, their bu&s;ine&s;s lying chiefly upon the de|clivity
<PB N="173" REF="195">
of the rocks on each &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Monday 3.</NOTE> and the plains which ex|tended on their &s;ummits, where they found plenty of a wild plantain, which they called <HI>Vae.</HI> The way up the&s;e rocks from the banks of the river was in every re&s;pect dreadful; the &s;ides were nearly perpendicular, and in &s;ome places one hundred feet high; they were al&s;o rendered exceeding &s;lip|pery by the water of innumerable &s;prings which i&s;&s;ued from the fi&s;&s;ures on the &s;urface: yet up the&s;e precipices a way was to be traced by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of long pieces of the bark of the <HI>Hibi&s;cus tiliaceus,</HI> which &s;erved as a rope for the climber to take hold of, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in &s;crambling from one ledge to another, though upon the&s;e ledges there was footing only for an Indian or a goat. One of the&s;e ropes was nearly thirty feet in length, and their guides offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in mounting this pa&s;s, but recommended another at a little di&s;|tance lower down, as le&s;s difficult and dangerous. They took a view of this "better way," but found it &s;o bad that they did not to chu&s;e to attempt it, as there was nothing at the top to reward their toil and hazard but a grove of the wild plantain or Vae tree, which they had often &s;een before.</P>
<P>During this excur&s;ion, Mr. Banks had an excellent oppor|tunity to examine the rocks, which were almo&s;t every where naked, for minerals; but he found not the lea&s;t appearance of any. The &s;tones every where, like tho&s;e of Madeira, &s;hewed manife&s;t tokens of having been burnt; nor is there a &s;ingle &s;pecimen of any &s;tone, among all tho&s;e that were collected in the i&s;land, upon which there are not manife&s;t and indubitable marks of fire; except perhaps &s;ome &s;mall pieces of the hatchet-&s;tone, and even of that, other fragments were collected which are burnt almo&s;t to a pumice. Traces of fire are al&s;o manife&s;t in the very clay upon the hills; and it may, therefore, not unrea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed, that this, and the neighbouring i&s;lands, are either &s;hattered remains
<PB N="174" REF="196">
of a continent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Monday 3.</NOTE> which &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed to be nece&s;&s;ary in this part of the globe, to pre&s;erve an equilibrium of its parts, which were left behind when the re&s;t &s;unk by the mining of a &s;ubterraneous fire, &s;o as to give a pa&s;&s;age to the &s;ea over it; or were torn from rocks, which, from the creation of the world, had been the bed of the &s;ea, and thrown up in heaps, to a height which the waters never reach. One or other of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions will perhaps be thought the more pro|bable, as the water does not gradually grow &s;hallow as the &s;hore is approached, and the i&s;lands are almo&s;t every where &s;urrounded by reefs, which appear to be rude and broken, as &s;ome violent concu&s;&s;ion would naturally leave the &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance of the earth. It may al&s;o be remarked upon this occa&s;ion, that the mo&s;t probable cau&s;e of earthquakes &s;eems to be the &s;udden ru&s;hing in of water upon &s;ome va&s;t ma&s;s of &s;ubterraneous fire, by the in&s;tantaneous rarefaction of which into vapour, the mine is &s;prung, and various &s;ub&s;tances, in all &s;tages of vitrification, with &s;hells, and other marine pro|ductions, that are now found fo&s;&s;il, and the &s;trata that co|vered the furnace, are thrown up; while tho&s;e parts of the land which were &s;upported upon the broken &s;hell give way, and &s;ink into the gulph. With this theory the phaenomena of all earthquakes &s;eem to agree; pools of water are frequently left where land has &s;ub&s;ided, and various &s;ub&s;tances, which manife&s;tly appear to have &s;uffered by the action of fire, are thrown up. It is indeed true, that fire cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out air; but this cannot be urged again&s;t there being fire below that part of the earth which forms the bed of the &s;ea; becau&s;e there may be innumerable fi&s;&s;ures by which a com|munication between tho&s;e parts and the external air may be kept up, even upon the highe&s;t mountains, and at the great|e&s;t di&s;tance from the &s;ea-&s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="197">On the 4th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Tue&s;day 4.</NOTE> Mr. Banks employed him&s;elf in planting a great quantity of the &s;eeds of water-melons, oranges, le|mons, limes, and other plants and trees which be had col|lected at Rio de Janeiro. For the&s;e he prepared ground on each &s;ide of the fort, with as many varieties of &s;oil as he could chu&s;e; and there is little doubt but that they will &s;uc|ceed. He al&s;o gave liberally of the&s;e &s;eeds to the Indians, and planted many of them in the woods: &s;ome of the melon &s;eeds having been planted &s;oon after our arrival, the natives &s;hewed him &s;everal of the plants which appeared to be in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition, and were continually a&s;king him for more.</P>
<P>We now began to prepare for our departure, by bending the &s;ails and performing other nece&s;&s;ary operations on board the &s;hip, our water being already on board, and the provi|&s;ions examined. In the mean time we had another vi&s;it from Oamo, Oberea, and their &s;on and daughter; the Indians ex|pre&s;&s;ing their re&s;pect by uncovering the upper parts of their body as they had done before. The daughter, who&s;e name we under&s;tood to be TOIMATA, was very de&s;irous to &s;ee the fort, but her father would by no means &s;uffer her to come in. Tearee, the &s;on of Waheatua, the &s;overeign of Tiarrabou, the &s;outh ea&s;t penin&s;ula, was al&s;o with us at this time; and we received intelligence of the landing of another gue&s;t, who&s;e company was neither expected nor de&s;ired: this was no other than the ingenious gentleman who contrived to &s;teal our quadrant. We were told, that he intended to try his fortune again in the night; but the Indians all offered very zealou&s;ly to a&s;&s;i&s;t us again&s;t him, de&s;iring that, for this purpo&s;e, they might be permitted to lie in the fort. This had &s;o good an effect, that the thief relinqui&s;hed his enterprize in de&s;pair.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="198"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Friday 7.</NOTE>On the 7th, the carpenters were employed in taking down the gates and palli&s;adoes of our little fortification, for fire|wood on board the &s;hip; and one of the Indians had dexte|rity enough to &s;teal the &s;taple and hook upon which the gate turned: he was immediately pur&s;ued, and after a chace of &s;ix miles, he appeared to have been pa&s;&s;ed, having concealed him&s;elf among &s;ome ru&s;hes in the brook; the ru&s;hes were &s;earched, and though the thief had e&s;caped, a &s;craper was found which had been &s;tolen from the &s;hip &s;ometime before; and &s;oon after our old friend Tubourai Tamaide brought us the &s;taple.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 8. Sunday 9.</NOTE>On the 8th and 9th, we continued to di&s;mantle our fort, and our friends &s;till flocked about us; &s;ome, I believe, &s;orry at the approach of our departure, and others de&s;irous to make as much as they could of us while we &s;taid.</P>
<P>We were in hopes that we &s;hould now leave the i&s;land, without giving or receiving any other offence; but it un|fortunately happened otherwi&s;e. Two foreign &s;eamen hav|ing been out with my permi&s;&s;ion, one of them was robbed of his knife, and endeavouring to recover it, probably with circum&s;tances of great provocation, the Indians attacked him and dangerou&s;ly wounded him with a &s;tone; they wounded his companion al&s;o &s;lightly in the head, and then fled into the mountains. As I &s;hould have been &s;orry to take any far|ther notice of the affair, I was not di&s;plea&s;ed that the offen|ders had e&s;caped; but I was immediately involved in a quar|rel which I very much regretted, and which yet it was not po&s;&s;ible to avoid.</P>
<P>In the middle of the night between the 8th and 9th, Cle|ment Webb and Samuel Gib&s;on, two of the marines, both young men, went privately from the fort, and in the morn|ing were not to be found. As publick notice had been given,
<PB N="177" REF="199">
that all hands were to go on board on the next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Sunday 9.</NOTE> and that the &s;hip would &s;ail on the morrow of that day or the day fol|lowing, I began to fear that the ab&s;entees intended to &s;tay behind. I knew that I could take no effectual &s;teps to re|cover them, without endangering the harmony and good-will which at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among us; and, therefore, determined to wait a day for the chance of their return.</P>
<P>On Monday morning the 10th, the marines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 10.</NOTE> to my great concern, not being returned, an enquiry was made after them of the Indians, who frankly told us, that they did not intend to return, and had taken refuge in the mountains, where it was impo&s;&s;ible for our people to find them. They were then reque&s;ted to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;earch, and after &s;ome de|liberation, two of them undertook to conduct &s;uch per&s;ons as I &s;hould think proper to &s;end after them to the place of their retreat. As they were known to be without arms, I thought two would be &s;ufficient, and accordingly di&s;patched a petty officer, and the corporal of the marines, with the In|dian guides, to fetch them back. As the recovery of the&s;e men was a matter of great importance, as I had no time to lo&s;e, and as the Indians &s;poke doubtfully of their return, telling us, that they had each of them taken a wife, and were become inhabitants of the country, it was intimated to &s;everal of the Chiefs who were in the fort with their women, among whom were Tubourai Tamaide, Tomio, and Oberea, that they would not be permitted to leave it till our de&s;erters were brought back. This precaution I thought the more nece&s;&s;ary, as, by concealing them a few days, they might compel me to go without them; and I had the plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, that they received the intimation with very little &s;igns either of fear or di&s;content; a&s;&s;uring me that my people &s;hould be &s;ecured and &s;ent back as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. While this was doing at the fort, I &s;ent Mr. Hicks in the pinnace to
<PB N="178" REF="200">
fetch Tootahah on board the &s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Monday 10.</NOTE> which he did, without alarming either him or his people. If the Indian guides proved faithful and in earne&s;t, I had rea&s;on to expect the re|turn of my people with the de&s;erters before evening. Being di&s;appointed, my &s;u&s;picions increa&s;ed; and night coming on, I thought it was not &s;afe to let the people whom I had detained as ho&s;tages continue at the fort, and I therefore ordered Tubourai Tamaide, Oberea, and &s;ome others, to be taken on board the &s;hip. This &s;pread a general alarm, and &s;everal of them, e&s;pecially the women, expre&s;&s;ed their ap|prehen&s;ions with great emotion and many tears when they were put into the boat. I went on board with them, and Mr. Banks remained on &s;hore, with &s;ome others whom I thought it of le&s;s con&s;equence to &s;ecure.</P>
<P>About nine o'clock, Webb was brought back by &s;ome of the natives, who declared, that Gib&s;on, and the petty officer and corporal, would be detained till Tootahah &s;hould be &s;et at liberty. The tables were now turned upon me; but I had proceeded too far to retreat. I immediately di&s;patched Mr. Hicks in the long-boat, with a &s;trong party of men, to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners, and told tootahah that it behoved him to &s;end &s;ome of his people with them, with orders to afford them effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to demand the relea&s;e of my men in his name, for that I &s;hould expect him to an|&s;wer for the contrary. He readily complied; this party re|covered my men without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition; and about &s;even o'clock in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 11.</NOTE> returned with them to the &s;hip, though they had not been able to recover the arms which had been taken from them when they were &s;eized: the&s;e, however, were brought on board in le&s;s than half an hour, and the Chiefs were immediately &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>When I que&s;tioned the petty officer concerning what had happened on &s;hore, he told me, that neither the natives who

He &s;aid, however, that the Indians were not unanimous in this mea&s;ure; that &s;ome were for &s;etting them at liberty, and others for detain|ing them: that an eager di&s;pute en&s;ued, and that from words they came to blows, but that the party for detaining them at length prevailed: that &s;oon after, Webb and Gib&s;on were brought in by a party of the natives, as pri&s;oners, that they al&s;o might be &s;ecured as ho&s;tages for the Chief; but that it was after &s;ome debate re&s;olved to &s;end Webb to inform me of their re&s;olution, to a&s;&s;ure me that his companions were &s;afe, and direct me where I might &s;end my an&s;wer. Thus it appears that whatever were the di&s;advantages of &s;eizing the Chiefs, I &s;hould never have recovered my men by any other method. When the Chiefs were &s;et on &s;hore from the &s;hip, tho&s;e at the fort were al&s;o &s;et at liberty, and, after &s;taying with Mr. Banks about an hour, they all went away. Upon this occa&s;ion, as they had done upon another of the &s;ame kind, they expre&s;&s;ed their joy by an unde&s;erved libera|lity, &s;trongly urging us to accept of four hogs. The&s;e we ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed as a pre&s;ent, and they as ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;ing to be paid for them, the hogs did not change ma&s;ters. Upon examining the de&s;erters, we found that the account which the Indians had given of them was true: they had &s;trongly attached them&s;elves to two girls, and it was their

intention to conceal them&s;elves till the &s;hip had &s;ailed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Tue&s;day 11.</NOTE> and take up their re&s;idence upon the i&s;land. This night every thing was got off from the &s;hore, and every body &s;lept on board.</P>
<P>Among the natives who were almo&s;t con&s;tantly with us, was Tupia, who&s;e name has been often mentioned in this narrative. He had been, as I have before ob&s;erved, the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of Oberea, when &s;he was in the height of her power: he was al&s;o the chief Tahowa or prie&s;t of the i&s;land, con&s;equently well acquainted with the religion of the coun|try; as well with re&s;pect to its ceremonies as principles. He had al&s;o great experience and knowlege in navigation, and was particularly acquainted with the number and &s;ituation of the neighbouring i&s;lands. This man had often expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to go with us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 12.</NOTE> and on the 12th in the morning, having with the other natives left us the day before, he came on board, with a boy about thirteen years of age, his &s;ervant, and urged us to let him proceed with us on our voyage. To have &s;uch a per&s;on on board, was certainly de|&s;irable for many rea&s;ons; by learning his language, and teaching him ours, we &s;hould be able to acquire a much better knowlege of the cu&s;toms, policy, and religion of the people, than our &s;hort &s;tay among them could give us, I therefore gladly agreed to receive them on board. As we were prevented from &s;ailing to-day, by having found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make new &s;tocks to our &s;mall and be&s;t bower an|chors, the old ones having been totally de&s;troyed by the worms, Tupia &s;aid, he would go once more on &s;hore, and make a &s;ignal for the boat to fetch him off in the evening. He went accordingly, and took with him a miniature picture of Mr. Banks's, to &s;hew his friends, and &s;everal little things to give them as parting pre&s;ents.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="203">After dinner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Wedne&s;. 12.</NOTE> Mr. Banks being de&s;irous to procure a draw|ing of the Morai belonging to Tootahah at Eparr&eacute;, I attended him thither, accompanied by Dr. Solander, in the pinnace. As &s;oon as we landed, many of our friends came to meet us, though &s;ome ab&s;ented them&s;elves in re&s;entment of what had happened the day before. We immediately proceeded to Tootahah's hou&s;e, were we were joined by Oberea, with &s;everal others who had not come out to meet us, and a per|fect reconciliation was &s;oon brought about; in con&s;equence of which they promi&s;ed to vi&s;it us early the next day, to take a la&s;t farewel of us, as we told them we &s;hould certainly &s;et &s;ail in the afternoon. At this place al&s;o we found Tupia, who returned with us, and &s;lept this night on board the &s;hip for the fir&s;t time.</P>
<P>On the next morning, Thur&s;day the 13th of July,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 13.</NOTE> the &s;hip was very early crouded with our friends, and &s;urrounded by a multitude of canoes, which were filled with the natives of an inferior cla&s;s. Between eleven and twelve we weighed anchor, and as &s;oon as the &s;hip was under &s;ail, the Indians on board took their leaves, and wept, with a decent and &s;ilent &s;orrow, in which there was &s;omething very &s;triking and tender: the people in the canoes, on the contrary, &s;eemed to vie with each other in the loudne&s;s of their la|mentations, which we con&s;idered rather as affectation than grief. Tupia &s;u&s;tained him&s;elf in this &s;cene with a firmne&s;s and re&s;olution truly admirable: he wept indeed, but the effort that he made to conceal his tears, concurred, with them, to do him honour. He &s;ent his la&s;t pre&s;ent, a &s;hirt, by Otheothea, to Potomai, Tootahah's favourite mi&s;tre&s;s, and then went with Mr. Banks to the ma&s;t-head, waving to the canoes as long as they continued in &s;ight.</P>

The accidental dif|ferences which now and then happened, could not be more &s;incerely regretted on their part than they were on ours: the principal cau&s;es were &s;uch as nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ulted from our &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, in conjunction with the infir|mities of human nature, from our not being able perfectly to under&s;tand each other, and from the di&s;po&s;ition of the in|habitants to theft, which we could not at all times bear with or prevent. They had not, however, except in one in&s;tance, been attended with any fatal con&s;equence; and to that acci|dent were owing the mea&s;ures that I took to prevent others of the &s;ame kind. I hoped, indeed, to have availed my&s;elf of the impre&s;&s;ion which had been made upon them by the lives that had been &s;acrificed in their conte&s;t with the Dol|phin, &s;o as that the intercour&s;e between us &s;hould have been carried on wholly without blood&s;hed; and by this hope all my mea&s;ures were directed during the whole of my conti|nuance at the i&s;land, and I &s;incerely wi&s;h, that whoever &s;hall next vi&s;it it, may be &s;till more fortunate. Our traffick here was carried on with as much order as in the be&s;t regulated mar|ket in Europe. It was managed principally by Mr. Banks, who was indefatigable in procuring provi&s;ion and refre&s;h|ments while they were to be had; but during the latter part of our time they became &s;carce, partly by the increa&s;ed con|&s;umption at the fort and &s;hip, and partly by the coming on of the &s;ea&s;on in which cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit fail. All kind of fruit we purcha&s;ed for beads and nails, but no nails le&s;s than fortypenny were current: after a very &s;hort time we could never get a pig of more than ten or twelve pounds, for

<P>The be&s;t articles for traffick here are axes, hatchets, &s;pikes, large nails, looking-gla&s;&s;es, knives, and beads, for &s;ome of which, every thing that the natives have may be procured. They are indeed fond of fine linen cloth, both white and printed; but an ax worth half a crown, will fetch more than a piece of cloth worth twenty &s;hillings.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE>WE found the longitude of Port-Royal bay, in this i&s;land, as &s;ettled by Captain Wallis, who di&s;covered it on the 9th of June 1767, to be within half a degree of the truth. We found Point Venus, the northern extremity of the i&s;land, and the ea&s;tern point of the bay, to lie in the longitude of 149&deg; 30&prime; this being the mean re&s;ult of a great number of ob&s;ervations made upon the &s;pot. The i&s;land is &s;urrounded by a reef of coral rock, which forms &s;everal ex|cellent bays and harbours, &s;ome of which have been parti|cularly de&s;cribed, where there is room and depth of water for any number of the large&s;t &s;hips. Port-Royal bay, called by the natives Matavai, which is not inferior to any in Ota|heite, may ea&s;ily be known by a very high mountain in the middle of the i&s;land, which bears due &s;outh from Point Venus. To &s;ail into it, either keep the we&s;t point of the reef that lies before Point Venus, clo&s;e on board, or give it a birth of near half a mile, in order to avoid a &s;mall &s;hoal of coral rocks, on which there is but two fathom and an half of water. The be&s;t anchoring is on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the bay, where there is &s;ixteen and fourteen fathom upon an ou&s;ey bottom. The &s;hore of the bay is a fine &s;andy beach, behind which runs a river of fre&s;h water, &s;o that any number of &s;hips may water here without incommoding each other; but the only wood for firing, upon the whole i&s;land, is that of

There are &s;ome harbours to the we&s;tward of this bay which have not been mentioned, but, as they are contiguous to it, and laid down in the plan, a de&s;cription of them is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The face of the country, except that part of it which bor|ders upon the &s;ea, is very uneven; it ri&s;es in ridges that run up into the middle of the i&s;land, and there form moun|tains, which may be &s;een at the di&s;tance of &s;ixty miles: be|tween the foot of the&s;e ridges and the &s;ea, is a border of low land, &s;urrounding the whole i&s;land, except in a few places where the ridges ri&s;e directly from the &s;ea: the border of low land is in different parts of different breadths, but no where more than a mile and a half. The &s;oil, except upon the very tops of the ridges, is extremely rich and fertile, watered by a great number of rivulets of excellent water, and covered with fruit trees of various kinds, &s;ome of which are of a &s;tately growth and thick foliage, &s;o as to form one continued wood; and even the tops of the ridges, through in general they are bare, and burnt up by the &s;un, are, in &s;ome parts, not without their produce.</P>
<P>The low land that lies between the foot of the ridges and the &s;ea, and &s;ome of the vallies, are the only parts of the i&s;land that are inhabited, and here it is populous; the hou&s;es do not form villages or towns, but are ranged along the whole border at the di&s;tance of about fifty yards from each other, with little plantations of plantains, the tree which furni&s;hes them with cloth. The whole i&s;land, according to Tupia's account, who certainly knew, could furni&s;h &s;ix thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty fighting men, from which the number of inhabitants may ea&s;ily be computed.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="211"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Produce.</NOTE>The produce of this i&s;land is bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, ba|nanas, of thirteen forts, the be&s;t we had ever eaten; plan|tains; a fruit not unlike an apple, which, when ripe, is very plea&s;ant; &s;weet potatoes, yams, cocoas, a kind of <HI>Arum</HI>; a fruit known here by the name of <HI>Jambu,</HI> and reckoned mo&s;t deli|cious; &s;ugar cane, which the inhabitants eat raw; a root of the &s;alop kind, called by the inhabitants <HI>Pea</HI>; a plant called <HI>Ethee,</HI> of which the root only is eaten; a fruit that grows in a pod, like that of a large kidney-bean, which, when it is roa&s;ted, eats very much like a che&s;nut, by the natives called <HI>Ahee</HI>; a tree called <HI>Wharra,</HI> called in the Ea&s;t Indies <HI>Pandanes,</HI> which produces fruit, &s;omething like the pine-apple; a &s;hrub called <HI>Nono</HI>; the <HI>Morinda,</HI> which al&s;o produces fruit; a &s;pecies of fern, of which the root is eaten, and &s;ometimes the leaves; and a plant called <HI>Theve,</HI> of which the root al&s;o is eaten: but the fruits of the <HI>Nono,</HI> the fern, and the <HI>Theve,</HI> are eaten only by the inferior people, and in times of &s;car|city. All the&s;e, which &s;erve the inhabitants for food, the earth produces &s;pontaneou&s;ly, or with &s;o little culture, that they &s;eem to be exempted from the fir&s;t general cur&s;e, that "man &s;hould eat his bread in the &s;weat of his brow." They have al&s;o the Chine&s;e paper mulberry, <HI>morus papyrifera,</HI> which they call <HI>Aouta</HI>; a tree re&s;embling the wild fig-tree of the We&s;t Indies; another &s;pecies of fig, which they call <HI>Matte</HI>; the <HI>cordia &s;ebe&s;tina orientalis,</HI> which they call <HI>Etou</HI>; a kind of Cyperus gra&s;s, which they call <HI>Moo</HI>; a &s;pecies of <HI>tournefortia,</HI> which they call <HI>Taheinoo</HI>; another of the <HI>convolvulus poluce,</HI> which they call <HI>Eurhe</HI>; the <HI>&s;olanum centifolium,</HI> which they call <HI>Ebaoa</HI>; the <HI>calophyllum mophylum,</HI> which they call <HI>Tamannu</HI>; the <HI>hibi&s;cus tiliaceus,</HI> called <HI>Poerou,</HI> a frute&s;cent nettle; the <HI>urtica argentea,</HI> called <HI>Erowa</HI>; with many other plants which cannot here be particularly mentioned: tho&s;e that have been named already, will be referred to in the &s;ub&s;equent part of this work.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="212">They have no European fruit, garden &s;tuff, pul&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> or le|gumes, nor grain of any kind.</P>
<P>Of tame animals they have only hogs, dogs, and poultry; neither is there a wild animal in the i&s;land, except ducks, pigeons, paroquets, with a few other birds, and rats, there being no other quadruped, nor any &s;erpent. But the &s;ea &s;upplies them with great variety of mo&s;t excellent fi&s;h, to eat which is their chief luxury, and to catch it their prin|cipal labour.</P>
<P>As to the people they are of the large&s;t &s;ize of Europeans.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Per&s;ons.</NOTE> The men are tall, &s;trong, well-limbed, and finely &s;haped. The talle&s;t that we &s;aw was a man upon a neighbouring i&s;land, called HUAHEINE, who mea&s;ured &s;ix feet three inches and an half. The women of the &s;uperior rank are al&s;o in general above our middle &s;tature, but tho&s;e of the inferior cla&s;s are rather below it, and &s;ome of them are very &s;mall. This defect in &s;ize probably proceeds from their early com|merce with men, the only thing in which they differ from their &s;uperiors, that could po&s;&s;ibly affect their growth.</P>
<P>Their natural complexion is that kind of clear olive, or <HI>Brunette,</HI> which many people in Europe prefer to the fine&s;t white and red. In tho&s;e that are expo&s;ed to the wind and &s;un, it is con&s;iderably deepened, but in others that live under &s;helter, e&s;pecially the &s;uperior cla&s;s of women, it continues of its native hue, and the &s;kin is mo&s;t delicately &s;mooth and &s;oft; they have no tint in their cheeks, which we di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of colour. The &s;hape of the face is comely, the cheek bones are not high, neither are the eyes hollow, nor the brow prominent: the only feature that does not cor|re&s;pond with our ideas of beauty is the no&s;e, which, in ge|neral, is &s;omewhat flat; but their eyes, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the women, are full of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ometimes &s;parkling with

fire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes melting with &s;oftne&s;s; their teeth al&s;o are, almo&s;t without exception, mo&s;t beautifully even and white, and their breath perfectly without taint.</P>
<P>The hair is almo&s;t univer&s;ally black, and rather coar&s;e; the men have beards, which they wear in many fa&s;hions, always, however, plucking out great part of them, and keep|ing the re&s;t perfectly clean and neat. Both &s;exes al&s;o eradi|cate every hair from under their arms, and accu&s;ed us of great uncleanline&s;s for not doing the &s;ame. In their motions there is at once vigour and ea&s;e; their walk is graceful, their deportment liberal, and their behaviour to &s;trangers and to each other affable and courteous. In their di&s;po&s;itions al&s;o, they &s;eemed to be brave, open, and candid, without either &s;u&s;picion or treachery, cruelty or revenge; &s;o that we placed the &s;ame confidence in them as in our be&s;t friends, many of us, particularly Mr. Banks, &s;leeping frequently in their hou&s;es in the woods, without a companion, and con&s;e|quently wholly in their power. They were, however, all thieves; and when that is allowed, they need not much fear a competition with the people of any other nation upon earth. During our &s;tay in this i&s;land we &s;aw about five or &s;ix per&s;ons, like one that was met by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solan|der on the 24th of April, in their walk to the ea&s;tward, who&s;e &s;kins were of a dead white, like the no&s;e of a white hor&s;e; with white hair, beard, brows, and eye-la&s;hes; red, tender eyes; a &s;hort &s;ight, and &s;curfy &s;kins, covered with a kind of white down; but we found that no two of the&s;e belonged to the &s;ame family, and therefore concluded, that they were not a &s;pecies, but unhappy individuals, rendered anomalous by di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dre&s;s.</NOTE>It is a cu&s;tom in mo&s;t countries where the inhabitants have long hair, for the men to cut it &s;hort and the women to pride

them&s;elves in its length. Here, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> the contrary cu&s;|tom prevails; the women always cut it &s;hort round their ears, and the men, except the fi&s;hers, who are almo&s;t conti|nually in the water, &s;uffer it to flow in large waves over their &s;houlders, or tie it up in a bunch on the top of their heads.</P>
<P>They have a cu&s;tom al&s;o of anointing their heads, with what they call <HI>Monoe,</HI> an oil expre&s;&s;ed from the cocoa-nut, in which &s;ome &s;weet herbs or flowers have been infu&s;ed: as the oil is generally rancid, the &s;mell is at fir&s;t very di&s;agreeable to a European; and as they live in a hot country, and have no &s;uch thing as a comb, they are not able to keep their heads free from lice, which the children and common people &s;ome|times pick out and eat: a hateful cu&s;tom, wholly different from their manners in every other particular; for they are delicate and cleanly almo&s;t without example, and tho&s;e to whom we di&s;tributed combs, &s;oon delivered them&s;elves from vermin, with a diligence which &s;howed that they were not more odious to us than to them.</P>
<P>They have a cu&s;tom of &s;taining their bodies, nearly in the &s;ame manner as is practi&s;ed in many other parts of the world, which they call <HI>Tattowing.</HI> They prick the &s;kin, &s;o as ju&s;t not to fetch blood, with a &s;mall in&s;trument, &s;omething in the form of a hoe; that part which an&s;wers to the blade is made of a bone or &s;hell, &s;craped very thin, and is from a quarter of an inch to an inch and a half wide; the edge is cut into &s;harp teeth or points, from the number of three to twenty, according to its &s;ize: when this is to be u&s;ed, they dip the teeth into a mixture of a kind of lamp-black, formed of the &s;moke that ri&s;es from an oily nut which they burn in&s;tead of candles, and water; the teeth, thus prepared, are placed upon the &s;kin, and the handle to which they are fa&s;|tened

The operation is painful, and it is &s;ome days before the wounds are healed. It is performed upon the youth of both &s;exes when they are about twelve or fourteen years of age, on &s;everal parts of the body, and in various figures, according to the fancy of the parent, or perhaps the rank of the party. The women are generally marked with this &s;tain, in the form of a Z, on every joint of their fingers and toes, and frequently round the out&s;ide of their feet: the men are al&s;o marked with the &s;ame figure, and both men and women have &s;quares, circles, cre&s;cents, and ill-de&s;igned repre&s;entations of men, birds, or dogs, and various other devices impre&s;&s;ed upon their legs and arms, &s;ome of which we were told had &s;ignifications, though we could never learn what they were. But the part on which the&s;e ornaments are lavi&s;hed with the greate&s;t profu&s;ion, is the breech: this, in both &s;exes, is covered with a deep black; above which, arches are drawn one over another as high as the &s;hort ribs. They are often a quarter of an inch broad, and the edges are not &s;trait lines, but indented. The&s;e arches are their pride, and are &s;hewn both by men and women with a mixture of o&s;ten|tation and plea&s;ure; whether as an ornament, or a proof of their fortitude and re&s;olution in bearing pain, we could not determine. The face in general is left unmarked; for we &s;aw but one in&s;tance to the contrary. Some old men had the greate&s;t part of their bodies covered with large patches of black, deeply indented at the edges, like a rude imitation of flame; but we were told, that they came from a low i&s;land called NOOUOORA, and were not natives of Otaheite.</P>

The girl bore it with mo&s;t &s;toical re&s;olution for about a quarter of an hour; but the pain of &s;o many hundred punctures as &s;he had received in that time then became intolerable: &s;he fir&s;t complained in murmurs, then wept, and at la&s;t bur&s;t into loud lamentations, earne&s;tly imploring the operator to de&s;i&s;t. He was, however, inexorable; and when &s;he began to &s;truggle, &s;he was held down by two women, who &s;ometimes &s;oothed and &s;ometimes chid her, and now and then, when &s;he was mo&s;t unruly, gave her a &s;mart blow. Mr. Banks &s;taid in a neighbouring hou&s;e an hour, and the operation was not over when he went away; yet it was performed but upon one &s;ide, the other having been done &s;ometime before; and the arches upon the loins, in which they mo&s;t pride them&s;elves, and which give more pain than all the re&s;t, were &s;till to be done.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange that the&s;e people &s;hould value them&s;elves upon what is no di&s;tinction; for I never &s;aw a native of this i&s;land, either man or woman, in a &s;tate of maturity, in whom the&s;e marks were wanting: po&s;&s;ibly they may have their ri&s;e in &s;uper&s;tition, e&s;pecially as they produce no vi&s;ible advantage, and are not made without great pain; but though we en|quired of many hundreds, we could never get any account of the matter.</P>

two pieces &s;ewed together.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> The dre&s;s of the better &s;ort of women con&s;i&s;ts of three or four pieces: one piece, about two yards wide and eleven yards long, they wrap &s;everal times round their wai&s;t, &s;o as to hang down like a petticoat as low as the middle of the leg, and this they call <HI>Parou:</HI> two or three other pieces, about two yards and an half long and one wide, each having a hole cut in the middle, they place one upon another, and then putting the head through the holes, they bring the long ends down before and behind; the others remain open at the &s;ides, and give liberty to the arms: this, which they call the <HI>Tebuta,</HI> is gathered round the wai&s;t, and confined with a girdle or &s;a&s;h of thinner cloth, which is long enough to go many times round them, and exactly re|&s;embles the garment worn by the inhabitants of Peru and Chili, which the Spaniards call <HI>Poncho.</HI> The dre&s;s of the men is the &s;ame, except that in&s;tead of &s;uffering the cloth that is wound about the hips to hang down like a petticoat, they bring it between their legs &s;o as to have &s;ome re&s;em|blance to breeches, and it is then called <HI>Maro.</HI> This is the dre&s;s of all ranks of people, and being univer&s;ally the &s;ame as to form, the gentlemen and ladies di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the lower people by the quantity; &s;ome of them will wrap round them &s;everal pieces of cloth, eight or ten yards long, and two or three broad; and &s;ome throw a large piece loo&s;ely over their &s;houlders in the manner of a cloak, or per|haps two pieces, if they are very great per&s;onages, and are de&s;irous to appear in &s;tate. The inferior &s;ort, who have only a &s;mall allowance of cloth from the tribes or families to which they belong, are obliged to be more thinly clad. In the heat of the day they appear almo&s;t naked, the women having only a &s;canty petticoat, and the men nothing but the &s;a&s;h that is pa&s;&s;ed between their legs and fa&s;tened round the wai&s;t. As finery is always trouble&s;ome, and particularly in
<PB N="193" REF="219">
a hot country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> where it con&s;i&s;ts in putting one covering upon another, the women of rank always uncover them&s;elves as low as the wai&s;t in the evening, throwing off all that they wear on the upper part of the body, with the &s;ame negligence and ea&s;e as our ladies would lay by a cardinal or double handkerchief. And the Chiefs, even when they vi&s;ited us, though they had as much cloth round their middle as would clothe a dozen people, had frequently the re&s;t of the body quite naked.</P>
<P>Upon their legs and feet they wear no covering; but they &s;hade their faces from the &s;un with little bonnets, either of matting or of cocoa-nut leaves, which they make occa&s;ionally in a few minutes. This, however, is not all their head|dre&s;s; the women &s;ometimes wear little turbans, and &s;ome|times a dre&s;s which they value much more, and which, in|deed, is much more becoming, called <HI>Tomou</HI>; the <HI>Tomou</HI> con|&s;i&s;ts of human hair, plaited in threads, &s;carcely thicker than &s;ewing &s;ilk. Mr. Banks has pieces of it above a mile in length, without a knot. The&s;e they wind round the head in &s;uch a manner as produces a very pretty effect, and in a very great quantity; for I have &s;een five or &s;ix &s;uch pieces wound about the head of one woman: among the&s;e threads they &s;tick flowers of various kinds, particularly the cape-je&s;&s;amine, of which they have great plenty, as it is always planted near their hou&s;es. The men &s;ometimes &s;tick the tail feather of the Tropic-bird upright in their hair, which, as I have ob|&s;erved before, is often tied in a bunch upon the top of their heads: &s;ometimes they wear a kind of whim&s;ical garland, made of flowers of various kinds, &s;tuck into a piece of the rind of a plantain; or of &s;carlet peas, &s;tuck with gum upon a piece of wood: and &s;ometimes they wear a kind of wig, made of the hair of men or dogs, or perhaps of cocoa-nut &s;trings, woven upon one thread, which is tied under their
<PB N="194" REF="220">
hair,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> &s;o that the&s;e artificial honours of their head may hang down behind. Their per&s;onal ornaments, be&s;ides flowers, are few; both &s;exes wear ear-rings, but they are placed only on one &s;ide: when we came they con&s;i&s;ted of &s;mall pieces of &s;hell, &s;tone, berries, red peas, or &s;ome &s;mall pearls, three in a &s;tring; but our beads very &s;oon &s;upplanted them all.</P>
<P>The children go quite naked; the girls till they are three or four years old, and the boys till they are &s;ix or &s;even.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hou&s;es.</NOTE> or rather dwellings of the&s;e people have been occa&s;ionally mentioned before: they are all built in the wood, between the &s;ea and the mountains, and no more ground is cleared for each hou&s;e, than ju&s;t &s;ufficient to pre|vent the dropping of the branches from rotting the thatch with which they are covered; from the hou&s;e, therefore, the inhabitant &s;teps immediately under the &s;hade, which is the mo&s;t delightful that can be imagined. It con&s;i&s;ts of groves of bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts, without underwood, which are inter&s;ected, in all directions, by the paths that lead from one hou&s;e to the other. Nothing can be more grateful than this &s;hade in &s;o warm a climate, nor any thing more beauti|ful than the&s;e walks. As there is no underwood, the &s;hade cools without impeding the air; and the hou&s;es, having no walls, receive the gale from whatever point it blows. I &s;hall now give a particular de&s;cription of a hou&s;e of a middling &s;ize, from which, as the &s;tructure is univer&s;ally the &s;ame, a perfect idea may be formed both of tho&s;e that are bigger, and tho&s;e that are le&s;s.</P>
<P>The ground which it covers is an oblong &s;quare, four and twenty feet long, and eleven wide; over this a roof is rai&s;ed, upon three rows of pillars or po&s;ts, parallel to each other, one on each &s;ide, and the other in the middle. This roof con&s;i&s;ts of two flat &s;ides inclining to each other, and termi|nating
<PB N="195" REF="221">
in a ridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> exactly like the roofs of our thatched hou&s;es in England. The utmo&s;t height within is about nine feet, and the eaves on each &s;ide reach to within about three feet and an half of the ground: below this, and through the whole height at each end, it is open, no part of it being in|clo&s;ed with a wall. The roof is thatched with palm-leaves, and the floor is covered, &s;ome inches deep, with &s;oft hay; over this are laid mats, &s;o that the whole is one cu&s;hion, upon which they &s;it in the day, and &s;leep in the night. In &s;ome hou&s;es, however, there is one &s;tool, which is wholly appropriated to the ma&s;ter of the family; be&s;ides this, they have no furniture, except a few little blocks of wood, the upper &s;ide of which is hollowed into a curve, and which &s;erve them for pillows.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e is indeed principally u&s;ed as a dormitory; for, except it rains, they eat in the open air, under the &s;hade of the next tree. The clothes that they wear in the day, &s;erve them for covering in the night; the floor is the common bed of the whole hou&s;ehold, and is not divided by any parti|tion. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e and his wife &s;leep in the middle, next to them the married people, next to them the unmarried women, and next to them, at a little di&s;tance, the unmarried men; the &s;ervants, or <HI>Toutous,</HI> as they are called, &s;leep in the open air, except it rains, and in that ca&s;e they come ju&s;t within the &s;hed.</P>
<P>There are, however, hou&s;es of another kind, belonging to the Chiefs, in which there is &s;ome degree of privacy. The&s;e are much &s;maller, and &s;o con&s;tructed as to be carried about in their canoes from place to place, and &s;et up occa&s;ionally, like a tent; they are inclo&s;ed on the &s;ides with cocoa-nut leaves, but not &s;o clo&s;e as to exclude the air, and the Chief and his wife &s;leep in them alone.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="222"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE>There are hou&s;es al&s;o of a much larger &s;ize, not built ei|ther for the accommodation of a &s;ingle Chief, or a &s;ingle fa|mily; but as common receptacles for all the people of a di&s;trict. Some of them are two hundred feet long, thirty broad, and, under the ridge, twenty feet high; the&s;e are built and maintained at the common expence of the di&s;trict, for the accommodation of which they are intended; and have on one &s;ide of them a large area, inclo&s;ed with low pal|li&s;adoes.</P>
<P>The&s;e hou&s;es, like tho&s;e of &s;eparate families, have no walls. Privacy, indeed, is little wanted among people who have not even the idea of indecency, and who gratify every appetite and pa&s;&s;ion before witne&s;&s;es, with no more &s;en&s;e of impropriety than we feel when we &s;atisfy our hunger at a &s;ocial board with our family or friends. Tho&s;e who have no idea of indecency with re&s;pect to actions, can have none with re&s;pect to words; it is, therefore, &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that, in the conver&s;ation of the&s;e people, that which is the principal &s;ource of their plea&s;ure, is always the prin|cipal topic; and that every thing is mentioned without any re&s;traint or emotion, and in the mo&s;t direct terms, by both &s;exes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Food.</NOTE>Of the food eaten here the greater part is vegetable. Here are no tame animals except hogs, dogs, and poultry, as I have ob&s;erved before, and the&s;e are by no means plenty. When a Chief kills a hog, it is almo&s;t equally divided among his dependants; and as they are very numerous, the &s;hare of each individual at the&s;e fea&s;ts, which are not frequent, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;mall. Dogs and fowls fall &s;omewhat more frequently to the &s;hare of the common people. I cannot much commend the flavour of their fowls; but we all agreed, that a South Sea dog was little inferior to an Engli&s;h lamb;
<PB N="197" REF="223">
their excellence is probably owing to their being kept up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and fed wholly upon vegetables. The &s;ea affords them a great variety of fi&s;h. The &s;maller fi&s;h, when they catch any, are generally eaten raw, as we eat oy&s;ters; and nothing that the &s;ea produces comes ami&s;s to them: they are fond of lob|&s;ters, crabs, and other &s;hell-fi&s;h, which are found upon the coa&s;t; and they will eat not only &s;ea-in&s;ects, but what the &s;eamen call <HI>Blubbers,</HI> though &s;ome of them are &s;o tough, that they are obliged to &s;uffer them to become putrid before they can be chewed. Of the many vegetables that have been men|tioned already as &s;erving them for food, the principal is the bread-fruit, to procure which co&s;ts them no trouble or labour but climbing a tree: the tree which produces it, does not indeed &s;hoot up &s;pontaneou&s;ly; but if a man plants ten of them in his lifetime, which he may do in about an hour, he will as completely fulfil his duty to his own and future genera|tions, as the native of our le&s;s temperate climate can do by ploughing in the cold of winter, and reaping in the &s;um|mer's heat, as often as the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons return; even if, after he has procured bread for his pre&s;ent hou&s;ehold, he &s;hould con|vert a &s;urplus into money, and lay it up for his children.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, that the bread-fruit is not always in &s;ea|&s;on; but cocoa-nuts, bananas, plantains, and a great variety of other fruits, &s;upply the deficiency.</P>
<P>It may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, that cookery is but little &s;tudied by the&s;e people as an art; and, indeed, they have but two ways of applying fire to dre&s;s their food, broiling and bak|ing; the operation of broiling is &s;o &s;imple that it requires no de&s;cription, and their baking has been de&s;cribed already, (page 152.) in the account of an entertainment prepared for us by Tupia. Hogs, and large fi&s;h, are extremely well dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame manner; and, in our opinion, were more
<PB N="198" REF="224">
juicy and more equally done than by any art of cookery now practi&s;ed in Europe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> Bread-fruit is al&s;o cooked in an oven of the &s;ame kind, which renders it &s;oft, and &s;omething like a boiled potatoe; not quite &s;o farinaceous as a good one, but more &s;o than tho&s;e of the middling &s;ort.</P>
<P>Of the bread-fruit they al&s;o make three di&s;hes, by putting either water or the milk of the cocoa-nut to it, then beating it to a pa&s;te with a &s;tone pe&s;tle, and afterwards mixing it with ripe plantains, bananas, or the &s;our pa&s;te which they call <HI>Mahie.</HI></P>
<P>The mahie, which has been mentioned as a &s;uccedaneum for ripe bread-fruit, before the &s;ea&s;on for gathering a fre&s;h crop comes on, is thus made:</P>
<P>The fruit is gathered ju&s;t before it is perfectly ripe, and being laid in heaps, is clo&s;ely covered with leaves; in this &s;tate it undergoes a fermentation, and becomes di&s;agreeably &s;weet: the core is then taken out entire, which is done by gently pulling the &s;talk, and the re&s;t of the fruit is thrown into a hole which is dug for that purpo&s;e, generally in the hou&s;es, and neatly lined in the bottom and &s;ides with gra&s;s; the whole is then covered with leaves, and heavy &s;tones laid upon them: in this &s;tate it undergoes a &s;econd fermentation, and becomes &s;our, after which it will &s;uffer no change for many months: it is taken out of the hole as it is wanted for u&s;e, and being made into balls, it is wrapped up in leaves and baked; after it is dre&s;&s;ed, it will keep five or &s;ix weeks. It is eaten both cold and hot, and the natives &s;eldom make a meal without it, though to us the ta&s;te was as di&s;agreeable as that of a pickled olive generally is the fir&s;t time it is eaten.</P>
<P>As the making of this mahie depends, like brewing, upon fermentation, &s;o, like brewing, it &s;ometimes fails, without
<PB N="199" REF="225">
their being able to a&s;certain the cau&s;e; it is very natural,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> therefore, that the making it &s;hould be connected with &s;u|per&s;titious notions and ceremonies. It generally falls to the lot of the old women, who will &s;uffer no creature to touch any thing belonging to it, but tho&s;e whom they employ as a&s;&s;i&s;tants, nor even to go into that part of the hou&s;e where the operation is carrying on. Mr. Banks happened to &s;poil a large quantity of it only by inadvertently touching a leaf which lay upon it. The old woman, who then pre&s;ided over the&s;e my&s;te|ries, told him, that the proce&s;s would fail; and immediately uncovered the hole in a fit of vexation and de&s;pair. Mr. Banks regretted the mi&s;chief he had done, but was &s;omewhat con|&s;oled by the opportunity which it gave him of examining the preparation, which perhaps, but for &s;uch an accident, would never have offered.</P>
<P>Such is their food, to which &s;alt-water is the univer&s;al &s;auce, no meal being eaten without it: tho&s;e who live near the &s;ea have it fetched as it is wanted; tho&s;e who live at &s;ome di&s;tance keep it in large bamboos, which are &s;et up in their hou&s;es, for u&s;e. Salt-water, however, is not their only &s;auce; they make another of the kernels of cocoa-nuts, which being fermented till they di&s;&s;olve into a pa&s;te &s;ome|what re&s;embling butter, are beaten up with &s;alt-water. The flavour of this is very &s;trong, and was, when we fir&s;t ta&s;ted it, exceedingly nau&s;eous; a little u&s;e, however, reconciled &s;ome of us to it &s;o much, that they preferred it to our own &s;auces, e&s;pecially with fi&s;h. The natives &s;eemed to con&s;ider it as a dainty, and do not u&s;e it at their common meals; po&s;|&s;ibly, becau&s;e they think it ill management to u&s;e cocoa-nuts &s;o lavi&s;hly, or perhaps, when we were at the i&s;land, they were &s;carcely ripe enough for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>For drink, they have in general nothing but water, or the juice of the cocoa-nut; the art of producing liquors that in|toxicate,
<PB N="200" REF="226">
by fermentation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> being happily unknown among them; neither have they any narcotic which they chew, as the natives of &s;ome other countries do opium, beetle-root, and tobacco. Some of them drank freely of our liquors, and in a few in&s;tances became very drunk; but the per&s;ons to whom this happened were &s;o far from de&s;iring to repeat the debauch, that they would never touch any of our liquors after|wards. We were however informed, that they became drunk by drinking a juice that is expre&s;&s;ed from the leaves of a plant which they call <HI>Ava Ava.</HI> This plant was not in &s;ea&s;on when we were there, &s;o that we &s;aw no in&s;tances of its effects; and as they con&s;idered drunkenne&s;s as a di&s;grace, they probably would have concealed from us any in&s;tances which might have happened during our &s;tay. This vice is almo&s;t peculiar to the Chiefs, and con&s;iderable per&s;ons, who vie with each other in drinking the greate&s;t number of draughts, each draught being about a pint. They keep this intoxicating juice with great care from their women.</P>
<P>Table they have none; but their apparatus for eating is &s;et out with great neatne&s;s, though the articles are too &s;imple and too few to allow any thing for &s;how: and they commonly eat alone; but when a &s;tranger happens to vi&s;it them, he &s;ome|times makes a &s;econd in their me&s;s. Of the meal of one of their principal people I &s;hall give a particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>He &s;its down under the &s;hade of the next tree, or on the &s;hady &s;ide of his hou&s;e, and a large quantity of leaves, either of the bread-fruit or banana, are neatly &s;pread before him upon the ground as a table-cloth; a ba&s;ket is then &s;et by him that contains his provi&s;ion, which, if fi&s;h or fle&s;h, is ready dre&s;&s;ed, and wrapped up in leaves, and two cocoa-nut &s;hells, one full of &s;alt water and the other of fre&s;h: his attendants, which are not few, &s;eat them&s;elves round him, and when all is ready, he begins by wa&s;hing his hands and his mouth
<PB N="201" REF="227">
thoroughly with the fre&s;h-water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and this he repeats almo&s;t continually throughout the whole meal; he then takes part of his provi&s;ion out of the ba&s;ket, which generally con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall fi&s;h or two, two or three bread-fruits, fourteen or fifteen ripe bananas, or &s;ix or &s;even apples: he fir&s;t takes half a bread-fruit, peels off the rind, and takes out the core with his nails; of this he puts as much into his mouth as it can hold, and while he chews it, takes the fi&s;h out of the leaves, and breaks one of them into the &s;alt water, placing the other, and what remains of the bread-fruit, upon the leaves that have been &s;pread before him. When this is done, he takes up a &s;mall piece of the fi&s;h that has been broken into the &s;alt-water, with all the fingers of one hand, and &s;ucks it into his mouth, &s;o as to get with it as much of the &s;alt-water as po&s;&s;ible: in the &s;ame manner he takes the re&s;t by different mor&s;els, and between each, at lea&s;t very fre|quently, takes a &s;mall &s;up of the &s;alt-water, either out of the cocoa-nut &s;hell, or the palm of his hand: in the mean time one of his attendants has prepared a young cocoa-nut, by peeling off the outer rind with his teeth, an operation which to an European appears very &s;urpri&s;ing; but it de|pends &s;o much upon &s;light, that many of us were able to do it before we left the i&s;land, and &s;ome that could &s;carcely crack a filbert: the ma&s;ter, when he chu&s;es to drink, takes the cocoa-nut thus prepared, and boring a hole through the &s;hell with his finger, or breaking it with a &s;tone, he &s;ucks out the liquor. When he has eaten his bread-fruit and fi&s;h, he begins with his plantains, one of which makes but a mouthful, though it be as big as a black-pudding; if in|&s;tead of plantains he has apples, he never ta&s;tes them till they have been pared; to do this a &s;hell is picked up from the ground, where they are always in plenty, and to&s;&s;ed to him by an attendant: he immediately begins to cut or &s;crape
<PB N="202" REF="228">
off the rind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> but &s;o awkwardly that great part of the fruit is wa&s;ted. If, in&s;tead of fi&s;h, he has fle&s;h, he mu&s;t have &s;ome &s;uccedaneum for a knife to divide it; and for this purpo&s;e a piece of bamboo is to&s;&s;ed to him, of which he makes the ne|ce&s;&s;ary implement by &s;plitting it tran&s;ver&s;ely with his nail. While all this has been doing, &s;ome of his attendants have been employed in bearing bread-fruit with a &s;tone pe&s;tle upon a block of wood; by being beaten in this manner, and &s;prinkled from time to time with water, it is reduced to the con&s;i&s;tence of a &s;oft pa&s;te, and is then put into a ve&s;&s;el &s;ome|what like a butcher's tray, and either made up alone, or mixed with banana or mahie, according to the ta&s;te of the ma&s;ter, by pouring water upon it by degrees and &s;queezing it often through the hand: under this operation it acquires the con&s;i&s;tence of a thick cu&s;tard, and a large cocoa-nut &s;hell full of it being &s;et before him, he &s;ips it as we &s;hould do a jelly if we had no &s;poon to take it from the gla&s;s: the meal is then fini&s;hed by again wa&s;hing his hands and his mouth. After which the cocoa-nut &s;hells are cleaned, and every thing that is left is replaced in the ba&s;ket.</P>
<P>The quantity of food which the&s;e people eat at a meal is prodigious: I have &s;een one man devour two or three fi&s;hes as big as a perch; three bread-fruits, each bigger than two fi&s;ts; fourteen or fifteen plantains or bananas, each of them &s;ix or &s;even inches long, and four or five round; and near a quart of the pounded bread-fruit, which is as &s;ub&s;tantial as the thicke&s;t unbaked cu&s;tard. This is &s;o extraordinary that I &s;carcely expect to be believed; and I would not have related it upon my own &s;ingle te&s;timony, but Mr. Banks, Dr. Solan|der, and mo&s;t of the other Gentlemen, have had ocular de|mon&s;tration of its truth, and know that I mention them upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="229">It is very wonderful, that the&s;e people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> who are remark|ably fond of &s;ociety, and particularly that of their women, &s;hould exclude its plea&s;ures from the table, where among all other nations, whether civil or &s;avage, they have been principally enjoyed. How a meal, which every where el&s;e brings families and friends together, came to &s;eparate them here, we often enquired, but could never learn. They eat alone, they &s;aid, becau&s;e it was right; but why it was right to eat alone, they never attempted to tell us: &s;uch, however, was the force of habit, that they expre&s;&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t di&s;|like, and even di&s;gu&s;t, at our eating in &s;ociety, e&s;pecially with our women, and of the &s;ame victuals. At fir&s;t, we thought this &s;trange &s;ingularity aro&s;e from &s;ome &s;uper&s;ti|tious opinion; but they con&s;tantly affirmed the contrary. We ob&s;erved al&s;o &s;ome caprices in the cu&s;tom, for which we could as little account as for the cu&s;tom it&s;elf. We could never prevail with any of the women to partake of the vic|tuals at our table when we were dining in company; yet they would go, five or &s;ix together, into the &s;ervants apart|ments, and there eat very heartily of whatever they could find, of which I have before given a particular in&s;tance; nor were they in the lea&s;t di&s;concerted if we came in while they were doing it. When any of us have been alone with a wo|man, &s;he has &s;ometimes eaten in our company; but then &s;he has expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t unwillingne&s;s that it &s;hould be known, and always extorted the &s;tronge&s;t promi&s;es of &s;e|crecy.</P>
<P>Among them&s;elves, even two brothers and two &s;i&s;ters have each their &s;eparate ba&s;kets, with provi&s;ion and the apparatus of their meal. When they fir&s;t vi&s;ited us at our tents, each brought his ba&s;ket with him; and when we &s;at down to table, they would go out, &s;it down upon the ground, at two or three yards di&s;tance from each other, and turning their
<PB N="204" REF="230">
faces different ways,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> take their repa&s;t without interchanging a &s;ingle word.</P>
<P>The women not only ab&s;tain from eating with the men, and of the &s;ame victuals, but even have their victuals &s;epa|rately prepared by boys kept for that purpo&s;e, who depo&s;it it in a &s;eparate &s;hed, and attend them with it at their meals.</P>
<P>But though they would not eat with us or with each other, they have often a&s;ked us to eat with them, when we have vi&s;ited tho&s;e with whom we were particularly acquainted at their hou&s;es; and we have often upon &s;uch occa&s;ions eaten out of the &s;ame ba&s;ket, and drunk out of the &s;ame cup. The elder women, however, always appeared to be offended at this liberty; and if we happened to touch their victuals, or even the ba&s;ket that contained it, would throw it away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dome&s;tic life, and amu&s;e|ments.</NOTE>After meals, and in the heat of the day, the middle-aged people of the better &s;ort generally &s;leep; they are indeed ex|tremely indolent, and &s;leeping and eating is almo&s;t all that they do. Tho&s;e that are older are le&s;s drowzy, and the boys and girls are kept awake by the natural activity and &s;pright|line&s;s of their age.</P>
<P>Their amu&s;ements have occa&s;ionally been mentioned in my account of the incidents that happened during our re&s;i|dence in this i&s;land, particularly mu&s;ic, dancing, wre&s;tling, and &s;hooting with the bow; they al&s;o &s;ometimes vie with each other in throwing a lance. As &s;hooting is not at a mark, but for di&s;tance; throwing the lance is not for di&s;tance, but at a mark: the weapon is about nine feet long, the mark is the bole of a plantain, and the di&s;tance about twenty yards.</P>
<P>Their only mu&s;ical in&s;truments are flutes and drums; the flutes are made of a hollow bamboo about a foot long, and, as has been ob&s;erved before, have only two &s;tops, and con|&s;equently but four notes, out of which they &s;eem hitherto to
<PB N="205" REF="231">
have formed but one tune;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> to the&s;e &s;tops they apply the fore finger of the left hand and the middle finger of the right.</P>
<P>The drum is made of a hollow block of wood, of a cylin|drical form, &s;olid at one end, and covered at the other with &s;hark's &s;kin: the&s;e they beat not with &s;ticks, but their hands; and they know how to tune two drums of different notes into concord. They have al&s;o an expedient to bring the flutes that play together into uni&s;on, which is to roll up a leaf &s;o as to &s;lip over the end of the &s;horte&s;t, like our &s;liding tubes for tele&s;copes, which they move up or down till the purpo&s;e is an&s;wered, of which they &s;eem to judge by their ear with great nicety.</P>
<P>To the&s;e in&s;truments they &s;ing; and, as I have ob&s;erved before, their &s;ongs are often extempore: they call every two ver&s;es or couplet a &s;ong, <HI>Pehay</HI>; they are generally, though not always in rhime; and when pronounced by the natives, we could di&s;cover that they were metre. Mr. Banks took great pains to write down &s;ome of them which were made upon our arrival, as nearly as he could expre&s;s their &s;ounds by combinations of our letters; but when we read them, not having their accent, we could &s;carcely make them either metre or rhime. The Reader will ea&s;ily perceive that they are of very different &s;tructure.

Of the&s;e ver&s;es our knowlege of the language is too im|perfect to attempt a tran&s;lation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> They frequently amu&s;e them&s;elves by &s;inging &s;uch couplets as the&s;e when they are alone, or with their families, e&s;pecially after it is dark; for though they need no fires, they are not without the comfort of artificial light between &s;un&s;et and bed-time. Their candles are made of the kernels of a kind of oily nut, which they &s;tick one over another upon a &s;kewer that is thru&s;t through the middle of them; the upper one being lighted, burns down to the &s;econd, at the &s;ame time con&s;uming that part of the &s;kewer which goes through it; the &s;econd taking fire burns in the &s;ame manner down to the third, and &s;o of the re&s;t: &s;ome of the&s;e candles will burn a con&s;iderable time, and they give a very tolerable light. They do not often &s;it up above an hour after it is dark; but when they have &s;tran|gers who &s;leep in the hou&s;e, they generally keep a light burning all night, po&s;&s;ibly as a check upon &s;uch of the women as they wi&s;h not to honour them with their favours.</P>
<P>Of their itinerary concerts I need add nothing to what has been &s;aid already; e&s;pecially as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion, more particularly, to mention them when I relate our adventures upon another i&s;land.</P>
<P>In other countries, the girls and unmarried women are &s;uppo&s;ed to be wholly ignorant of what others upon &s;ome occa&s;ions may appear to know; and their conduct and con|ver&s;ation are con&s;equently re&s;trained within narrower bounds, and kept at a more remote di&s;tance from whatever relates to a connection with the other &s;ex: but here, it is ju&s;t contrary. Among other diver&s;ions, there is a dance, called <HI>Timorodee,</HI> which is performed by young girls, whenever eight or ten of them can be collected together, con&s;i&s;ting of motions and ge&s;tures beyond imagination wanton, in the practice of which
<PB N="207" REF="233">
they are brought up from their earlie&s;t childhood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> accom|panied by words, which, if it were po&s;&s;ible, would more ex|plicitly convey the &s;ame ideas. In the&s;e dances they keep time with an exactne&s;s which is &s;carcely excelled by the be&s;t performers upon the &s;tages of Europe. But the practice which is allowed to the virgin, is prohibited to the woman from the moment that &s;he has put the&s;e hopeful le&s;&s;ons in practice, and realized the &s;ymbols of the dance.</P>
<P>It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that, among the&s;e people, cha&s;tity is held in much e&s;timation. It might be expected that &s;i&s;ters and daughters would be offered to &s;trangers, either as a courte&s;y, or for reward; and that breaches of conjugal fidelity, even in the wife; &s;hould not be otherwi&s;e puni&s;hed than by a few hard words, or perhaps a &s;light beating, as indeed is the ca&s;e: but there is a &s;cale in di&s;&s;olute &s;en&s;uality, which the&s;e people have a&s;cended, wholly unknown to every other nation who&s;e manners have been recorded from the beginning of the world to the pre&s;ent hour, and which no imagination could po&s;&s;ibly conceive.</P>
<P>A very con&s;iderable number of the principal people of Ota|heite, of both &s;exes, have formed them&s;elves into a &s;ociety, in which every woman is common to every man; thus &s;e|curing a perpetual variety as often as their inclination prompts them to &s;eek it, which is &s;o frequent, that the &s;ame man and woman &s;eldom cohabit together more than two or three days.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ocieties are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Arreoy</HI>; and the members have meetings, at which no other is pre|&s;ent, where the men amu&s;e them&s;elves by wre&s;tling, and the women, notwith&s;tanding their occa&s;ional connection with different men, dance the Timorodee in all its latitude, as an incitement to de&s;ires which it is &s;aid are frequently gratified
<PB N="208" REF="234">
upon the &s;pot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> This however is comparatively nothing. If any of the women happen to be with child, which in this manner of life happens le&s;s frequently than if they were to cohabit only with one man, the poor infant is &s;mothered the moment it is born, that it may be no incumbrance to the fa|ther, nor interrupt the mother in the plea&s;ures of her diabo|lical pro&s;titution. It &s;ometimes indeed happens, that the pa&s;&s;ion which prompts a woman to enter into this &s;ociety, is &s;urmounted when &s;he becomes a mother, by that in&s;tinctive affection which Nature has given to all creatures for the pre|&s;ervation of their offspring; but even in this ca&s;e, &s;he is not permitted to &s;pare the life of her infant, except &s;he can find a man who will patroni&s;e it as his child: if this can be done, the murder is prevented; but both the man and woman, being deemed by this act to have appropriated each other, are ejected from the community, and forfeit all claim to the privileges and plea&s;ures of Arreoy for the future; the woman from that time being di&s;tingui&s;hed by the term <HI>Whannownow,</HI> "bearer of children," which is here a term of reproach; though none can be more honourable in the e&s;timation of wi&s;dom and humanity, of right rea&s;on, and every pa&s;&s;ion that di&s;tingui&s;hes the man from the brute.</P>
<P>It is not fit that a practice &s;o horrid and &s;o &s;trange &s;hould be imputed to human beings upon &s;light evidence, but I have &s;uch as abundantly ju&s;tifies me in the account I have given. The people them&s;elves are &s;o far from concealing their connection with &s;uch a &s;ociety as a di&s;grace, that they boa&s;t of it as a privilege; and both my&s;elf and Mr. Banks, when particular per&s;ons have been pointed out to us as mem|bers of the Arreoy, have que&s;tioned them about it, and re|ceived the account that has been here given from their own lips. They have acknowledged, that they had long been of
<PB N="209" REF="235">
this accur&s;ed &s;ociety, that they belonged to it at that time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and that &s;everal of their children had been put to death.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not conclude my account of the dome&s;tic life of the&s;e people without mentioning their per&s;onal cleanline&s;s. If that which le&s;&s;ens the good of life and increa&s;es the evil is vice, &s;urely cleanline&s;s is a virtue: the want of it tends to de&s;troy both beauty and health, and mingles di&s;gu&s;t with our be&s;t plea&s;ures. The natives of Otaheite, both men and women, con&s;tantly wa&s;h their whole bodies in running wa|ter three times every day; once as &s;oon as they ri&s;e in the morning, once at noon, and again before they &s;leep at night, whether the &s;ea or river is near them or at a di&s;tance. I have already ob&s;erved, that they wa&s;h not only the mouth, but the hands at their meals, almo&s;t between every mor&s;el; and their clothes, as well as their per&s;ons, are kept without &s;pot or &s;tain; &s;o that in a large company of the&s;e people, nothing is &s;uffered but heat, which, perhaps, is more than can be &s;aid of the polite&s;t a&s;&s;embly in Europe.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of the Manufactures, Boats, and Navigation of Otaheite.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE>IF nece&s;&s;ity is the mother of invention, it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed to have been much exerted where the liberality of Nature has rendered the diligence of Art almo&s;t &s;uperfluous; yet there are many in&s;tances both of ingenuity and labour among the&s;e people, which, con&s;idering the want of metal for tools, do honour to both.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Manufac|tures.</NOTE>Their principal manufacture is their cloth, in the mak|ing and dying of which I think there are &s;ome particulars which may in&s;truct even the artificers of Great Britain, and for that rea&s;on my de&s;cription will be more minute.</P>
<P>Their cloth is of three kinds; and it is made of the bark of three different trees, the Chine&s;e paper mulberry, the bread-fruit tree, and the tree which re&s;embles the wild fig-tree of the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>The fine&s;t and white&s;t is made of the paper mulberry, <HI>Aouta</HI>; this is worn chiefly by the principal people, and when it is dyed red takes a better colour. A &s;econd &s;ort, inferior in whitene&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s, is made of the bread-fruit tree, <HI>Ooroo,</HI> and worn chiefly by the inferior people; and a third of the tree that re&s;embles the fig, which is coar&s;e and har&s;h, and of the colour of the darke&s;t brown paper: this, though it is le&s;s plea&s;ing both to the eye and the touch, is the mo&s;t valuable, becau&s;e it re&s;i&s;ts water, which the other two &s;orts will not. Of this, which is the mo&s;t rare as well as the mo&s;t
<PB N="211" REF="237">
u&s;eful, the greater part is perfumed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and worn by the Chiefs as a morning dre&s;s.</P>
<P>All the&s;e trees are propagated with great care, particularly the mulberry, which covers the large&s;t part of the culti|vated land, and is not fit for u&s;e after two or three year's growth, when it is about &s;ix or eight feet high, and &s;ome|what thicker than a man's thumb; its excellence is to be thin, &s;trait, tall, and without branches: the lower leaves, therefore, are carefully plucked off, with their germs, as often as there is any appearance of their producing a branch.</P>
<P>But though the cloth made of the&s;e three trees is different, it is all manufactured in the &s;ame manner; I &s;hall, there|fore, de&s;cribe the proce&s;s only in the fine &s;ort, that is made of the mulberry. When the trees are of a proper &s;ize, they are drawn up, and &s;tripped of their branches, after which the roots and tops are cut off; the bark of the&s;e rods being then &s;lit up longitudinally is ea&s;ily drawn off, and, when a proper quantity has been procured, it is carried down to &s;ome run|ning water, in which it is depo&s;ited to &s;oak, and &s;ecured from floating away by heavy &s;tones: when it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ufficiently &s;oftened, the women &s;ervants go down to the brook, and &s;tripping them&s;elves, &s;it down in the water, to &s;eparate the inner bark from the green part on the out&s;ide; to do this they place the under &s;ide upon a flat &s;mooth board, and with the &s;hell which our dealers call Tyger's tongue, <HI>Tellina gargadia,</HI> &s;crape it very carefully, dipping it conti|nually in the water till nothing remains but the fine fibres of the inner coat. Being thus prepared in the afternoon, they are &s;pread out upon plantain leaves in the evening; and in this part of the work there appears to be &s;ome difficulty, as the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family always &s;uperintends the doing
<PB N="212" REF="238">
of it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> they are placed in lengths of about eleven or twelve yards, one by the &s;ide of another, till they are about a foot broad, and two or three layers are al&s;o laid one upon the other: care is taken that the cloth &s;hall be in all parts of an equal thickne&s;s, &s;o that if the bark happens to be thinner in any particular part of one layer than the re&s;t, a piece that is &s;omewhat thicker is picked out to be laid over it in the next. In this &s;tate it remains till the morning, when great part of the water which it contained when it was laid out, is either drained off or evaporated, and the &s;everal fibres adhere to|gether, &s;o as that the whole may be rai&s;ed from the ground in one piece.</P>
<P>It is then taken away, and laid upon the &s;mooth &s;ide of a long piece of wood, prepared for the purpo&s;e, and beaten by the women &s;ervants, with in&s;truments about a foot long and three inches thick, made of a hard wood which they call <HI>Etoa.</HI> The &s;hape of this in&s;trument is not unlike a &s;quare razor &s;trop, only that the handle is longer, and each of its four &s;ides or faces is marked, lengthways, with &s;mall grooves, or furrows, of different degrees of finene&s;s; tho&s;e on one &s;ide being of a width and depth &s;ufficient to receive a &s;mall packthread, and the others finer in a regular gradation, &s;o that the la&s;t are not more than equal to &s;ewing &s;ilk.</P>
<P>They beat it fir&s;t with the coar&s;e&s;t &s;ide of this mallet, keep|ing time like our &s;miths; it &s;preads very fa&s;t under the &s;trokes, chiefly however in the breadth, and the grooves in the mallet mark it with the appearance of threads; it is &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively beaten with the other &s;ides, la&s;t with the fine&s;t, and is then fit for u&s;e. Sometimes, however, it is made &s;till thinner, by beating it with the fine&s;t &s;ide of the mallet, after it has been &s;everal times doubled: it is then called <HI>Hoboo,</HI> and is almo&s;t as thin as a mu&s;lin; it becomes very white by being
<PB REF="239">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="213" REF="240">
bleached in the air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> but is made &s;till whiter and &s;ofter by being wa&s;hed and beaten again after it has been worn.</P>
<P>Of this cloth there are &s;everal &s;orts, of different degrees of finene&s;s, in proportion as it is more or le&s;s beaten without being doubled: the other cloth al&s;o differs in proportion as it is beaten; but they differ from each other in con&s;equence of the different materials of which they are made. The bark of the bread-fruit is not taken till the trees are con&s;iderably longer and thicker than tho&s;e of the fig; the proce&s;s after|wards is the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When cloth is to be wa&s;hed after it has been worn, it is taken down to the brook, and left to &s;oak, being kept fa&s;t to the bottom, as at fir&s;t, by a &s;tone; it is then gently wrung or &s;queezed; and &s;ometimes &s;everal pieces of it are laid one upon another, and beaten together with the coar&s;e&s;t &s;ide of the mallet, and they are then equal in thickne&s;s to broad-cloth, and much more &s;oft and agreeable to the touch, after they have been a little while in u&s;e, though, when they come immediately from the mallet, they feel as if they had been &s;tarched. This cloth &s;ometimes breaks in the beating, but is ea&s;ily repaired by pa&s;ting on a patch with a gluten that is prepared from the root of the <HI>Pea,</HI> which is done &s;o nicely that it cannot be di&s;covered. The women al&s;o employ them|&s;elves in removing blemi&s;hes of every kind, as our ladies do in needle-work or knotting; &s;ometimes when their work is intended to be very fine, they will pa&s;te an entire covering of hoboo over the whole. The principal excellencies of this cloth are its coolne&s;s and &s;oftne&s;s; and its imperfections, its being pervious to water like paper, and almo&s;t as ea&s;ily torn.</P>
<P>The colours with which they die this cloth are principally red and yellow. The red is exceedingly beautiful, and I may venture to &s;ay, a brighter and more delicate colour than
<PB N="214" REF="241">
any we have in Europe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> that which approaches neare&s;t is our full &s;carlet, and the be&s;t imitation which Mr. Banks's na|tural hi&s;tory painter could produce, was by a mixture of ver|milion and carmine. The yellow is al&s;o a bright colour, but we have many as good.</P>
<P>The red colour is produced by the mixture of the juices of two vegetables, neither of which &s;eparately has the lea&s;t ten|dency to that hue. One is a &s;pecies of fig, called here <HI>Matte,</HI> and the other the <HI>Cordia Sebe&s;tina,</HI> or <HI>Etou</HI>; of the fig the fruit is u&s;ed, and of the <HI>Cordia</HI> the leaves.</P>
<P>The fruit of the fig is about as big as a rounceval pea, or very &s;mall goo&s;eberry; and each of them, upon breaking off the &s;talk very clo&s;e, produces one drop of a milky liquor, re|&s;embling the juice of our figs, of which the tree is indeed a &s;pecies. This liquor the women collect into a &s;mall quan|tity of cocoa-nut water: to prepare a gill of cocoa-nut water will require between three and four quarts of the&s;e little figs. When a &s;ufficient quantity is prepared, the leaves of the Etou are well wetted in it, and then laid upon a plantain leaf, where they are turned about till they become more and more flaccid, and then they are gently &s;queezed, gradually increa&s;|ing the pre&s;&s;ure, but &s;o as not to break them; as the flacci|dity increa&s;es, and they become &s;pungy, they are &s;upplied with more of the liquor; in about five minutes the colour begins to appear upon the veins of the leaves, and in about ten or a little more, they are perfectly &s;aturated with it: they are then &s;queezed, with as much force as can be ap|plied, and the liquor &s;trained at the &s;ame time that it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, the boys prepare a large quantity of the Moo, by drawing it between their teeth, or two little &s;ticks, till it is freed from the green bark and the branny &s;ub&s;tance
<PB N="215" REF="242">
that lies under it, and a thin web of the fibres only remains;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> in this the leaves of the Etou are inveloped, and through the&s;e the juice which they contain is &s;trained as it is forced out. As the leaves are not &s;ucculent, little more juice is pre&s;&s;ed out of them than they have imbibed: when they have been once emptied, they are filled again, and again pre&s;&s;ed till the quality which tinctures the liquor as it pa&s;&s;es through them is exhau&s;ted, they are then thrown away; but the Moo, being deeply &s;tained with the colour, is pre&s;erved, as a bru&s;h to lay the dye upon the cloth.</P>
<P>The expre&s;&s;ed liquor is always received into &s;mall cups made of the plantain leaf, whether from a notion that it has any quality favourable to the colour, or from the facility with which it is procured, and the convenience of &s;mall ve&s;|&s;els to di&s;tribute it among the artificers, I do not know.</P>
<P>Of the thin cloth they &s;eldom dye more than the edges, but the thick cloth is coloured through the whole &s;urface; the liquor is indeed u&s;ed rather as a pigment than a dye, for a coat of it is laid upon one &s;ide only, with the fibres of the Moo; and though I have &s;een of the thin cloth that has appeared to have been &s;oaked in the liquor, the colour has not had the &s;ame richne&s;s and lu&s;tre, as when it has been applied in the other manner.</P>
<P>Though the leaf of the Etou is generally u&s;ed in this pro|ce&s;s, and probably produces the fine&s;t colour; yet the juice of the figs will produce a red by a mixture with the &s;pecies of Tournefortia, which they call <HI>Taheinoo,</HI> the <HI>Pohuc,</HI> the <HI>Eurhe</HI> or <HI>Convolvulus Bra&s;ilien&s;is,</HI> and a &s;pecies of Solanum called <HI>Ebooa</HI>; from the u&s;e of the&s;e different plants, or from different proportions of the materials, many varieties are ob|ob&s;ervable in the colours of their cloth, &s;ome of which are con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;uperior to others.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="243"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE>The beauty, however, of the be&s;t is not permanent; but it is probable that &s;ome method might be found to fix it, if proper experiments were made, and perhaps to &s;earch for latent qualities, which may be brought out by the mixture of one vegetable juice with another, would not be an unprofit|able employment: our pre&s;ent mo&s;t valuable dyes afford &s;uf|ficient encouragement to the attempt; for by the mere in|&s;pection of indico, woad, dyer's weed, and mo&s;t of the leaves which are u&s;ed for the like purpo&s;es, the colours which they yield could never be di&s;covered. Of this Indian red I &s;hall only add, that the women who have been employed in preparing or u&s;ing it, carefully pre&s;erve the colour upon their fingers and nails, where it appears in its utmo&s;t beauty, as a great ornament.</P>
<P>The yellow is made of the bark of the root of the <HI>Morinda citrifolia,</HI> called <HI>Nono,</HI> by &s;craping and infu&s;ing it in water; after &s;tanding &s;ome time, the water is &s;trained and u&s;ed as a dye, the cloth being dipped into it. The Morinda, of which this is a &s;pecies, &s;eems to be a good &s;ubject for examination with a view to dyeing. Brown, in his hi&s;tory of Jamaica, mentions three &s;pecies of it, which he &s;ays are u&s;ed to dye brown; and Rumphius &s;ays of the <HI>Bancuda Augu&s;tifolia,</HI> which is nearly allied to our Nono, that it is u&s;ed by the in|habitants of the Ea&s;t-Indian i&s;lands, as a fixing drug for red colours, with which it particularly agrees.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this i&s;land al&s;o dye yellow with the fruit of the Tamanu; but how the colour is extracted, we had no opportunity to di&s;cover. They have al&s;o a prepara|tion with which they die brown and black; but the&s;e co|lours are &s;o indifferent, that the method of preparing them did not excite our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="244">Another con&s;iderable manufacture is matting of various kinds; &s;ome of which is finer, and better in every re&s;pect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> than any we have in Europe: the coar&s;er &s;ort &s;erves them to &s;leep upon, and the finer to wear in wet weather. With the fine, of which there are al&s;o two &s;orts, much pains is taken, e&s;pecially with that made of the bark of the Poerou, the <HI>Hi|bi&s;cus tiliaceus</HI> of Linnaeus, &s;ome of which is as fine as a coar&s;e cloth: the other &s;ort, which is &s;till more beautiful, they call <HI>Vanne</HI>; it is white, glo&s;&s;y, and &s;hining, and is made of the leaves of their <HI>Wharrou,</HI> a &s;pecies of the <HI>Pandanus,</HI> of which we had no opportunity to &s;ee either the flowers or fruit: they have other matts, or as they call them <HI>Moeas,</HI> to &s;it or to &s;leep upon, which are formed of a great variety of ru&s;hes and gra&s;s, and which they make, as they do every thing el&s;e that is plaited, with amazing facility and di&s;|patch.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o very dexterous in making ba&s;ket and wicker|work; their ba&s;kets are of a thou&s;and different patterns, many of them exceedingly neat; and the making them is an art that every one practi&s;es, both men and women: they make occa&s;ional ba&s;kets and panniers of the cocoa-nut leaf in a few minutes, and the women who vi&s;ited us early in a morning u&s;ed to &s;end, as &s;oon as the &s;un was high, for a few of the leaves, of which they made little bonnets to &s;hade their faces, at &s;o &s;mall an expence of time and trouble, that, when the &s;un was again low in the evening, they u&s;ed to throw them away. The&s;e bonnets, however, did not cover the head, but con&s;i&s;ted only of a band that went round it, and a &s;hade that projected from the forehead.</P>
<P>Of the bark of the Poerou they make ropes and lines, from the thickne&s;s of an inch to the &s;ize of a &s;mall packthread:
<PB N="218" REF="245">
with the&s;e they make nets for fi&s;hing:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> of the fibres of the cocoa-nut they make thread, for fa&s;tening together the &s;eve|ral parts of their canoes, and belts, either round or flat, twi&s;ted or plaited; and of the bark of the <HI>Erowa,</HI> a kind of nettle which grows in the mountains, and is therefore rather &s;carce, they make the be&s;t fi&s;hing lines in the world: with the&s;e they hold the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t active fi&s;h, &s;uch as Bonetas and Albicores, which would &s;nap our &s;tronge&s;t &s;ilk lines in a minute, though they are twice as thick.</P>
<P>They make al&s;o a kind of &s;eine, of a coar&s;e broad gra&s;s, the blades of which are like flags: the&s;e they twi&s;t and tie to|gether in a loo&s;e manner, till the net, which is about as wide as a large &s;ack, is from &s;ixty to eighty fathom long: this they haul in &s;hoal &s;mooth water, and its own weight keeps it &s;o clo&s;e to the ground that &s;carcely a &s;ingle fi&s;h can e&s;cape.</P>
<P>In every expedient, indeed, for taking fi&s;h, they are exceed|ingly ingenious; they make harpoons of cane, and point them with hard wood, which in their hands &s;trike fi&s;h more ef|fectually, than tho&s;e which are headed with iron can do in ours, &s;etting a&s;ide the advantage of ours being fa&s;tened to a line, &s;o that the fi&s;h is &s;ecured if the hook takes place, though it does not mortally wound him.</P>
<P>Of fi&s;h-hooks they have two &s;orts, admirably adapted in their con&s;truction as well to the purpo&s;e they are to an&s;wer, as to the materials of which they are made. One of the&s;e, which they call <HI>Wittee Wittee,</HI> is u&s;ed for towing. The &s;hank is made of mother of pearl, the mo&s;t glo&s;&s;y that can be got: the in&s;ide, which is naturally the brighte&s;t, is put behind. To the&s;e hooks a tuft of white dog's or hog's hair is fixed, &s;o as &s;ome|what to re&s;emble the tail of a fi&s;h; the&s;e implements, there|fore,
<PB N="219" REF="246">
are both hook and bait,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and are u&s;ed with a rod of bamboo, and line of <HI>Erowa.</HI> The fi&s;her, to &s;ecure his &s;uc|ce&s;s, watches the flight of the birds which con&s;tantly attend the Bonetas when they &s;wim in &s;hoals, by which he directs his canoe, and when he has the advantage of the&s;e guides, he &s;eldom returns without a prize.</P>
<P>The other kind of hook is al&s;o made of mother of pearl, or &s;ome other hard &s;hell: they cannot make them bearded like our hooks; but to effect the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they make the point turn inwards. The&s;e are made of all &s;izes, and u&s;ed to catch various kinds of fi&s;h, with great &s;ucce&s;s. The man|ner of making them is very &s;imple, and every fi&s;herman is his own artificer: the &s;hell is fir&s;t cut into &s;quare pieces, by the edge of another &s;hell, and wrought into a form corre|&s;ponding with the outline of the hook by pieces of coral, which are &s;ufficiently rough to perform the office of a file; a hole is then bored in the middle, the drill being no other than the fir&s;t &s;tone they pick up that has a &s;harp corner: this they fix into the end of a piece of bamboo, and turn it be|tween the hands like a chocolate mill; when the &s;hell is per|forated, and the hole &s;ufficiently wide, a &s;mall file of coral is introduced, by the application of which the hook is in a &s;hort time completed, few co&s;ting the artificer more time than a quarter of an hour.</P>
<P>Of their ma&s;onry, carving, and architecture, the Reader has already formed &s;ome idea from the account that has been given of the Morais, or repo&s;itories of the dead: the other mo&s;t important article of building and carving is their boats;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boats.</NOTE> and perhaps, to fabricate one of their principal ve&s;&s;els with their tools, is as great a work, as to build a Briti&s;h man of war with ours.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="247"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE>They have an adze of &s;tone; a chi&s;&s;el, or gouge, of bone, generally that of a man's arm between the wri&s;t and elbow; a ra&s;p of coral; and the &s;kin of a &s;ting-ray, with coral &s;and, as a file or poli&s;her.</P>
<P>This is a complete catalogue of their tools, and with the&s;e they build hou&s;es, con&s;truct canoes, hew &s;tone, and fell, cleave, carve, and poli&s;h timber.</P>
<P>The &s;tone which makes the blade of their adzes is a kind of Ba&s;altes, of a blacki&s;h or grey colour, not very hard, but of con&s;iderable toughne&s;s: they are formed of different &s;izes; &s;ome, that are intended for felling, weigh from &s;ix to eight pounds; others, that are u&s;ed for carving, not more than &s;o many ounces; but it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;harpen both almo&s;t every minute; for which purpo&s;e, a &s;tone and a cocoa-nut &s;hell full of water are always at hand.</P>
<P>Their greate&s;t exploit, to which the&s;e tools are le&s;s equal than to any other, is felling a tree: this requires many hands, and the con&s;tant labour of &s;everal days. When it is down, they &s;plit it, with the grain, into planks from three to four inches thick, the whole length and breadth of the tree, many of which are eight feet in the girt, and forty to the branches, and nearly of the &s;ame thickne&s;s throughout. The tree generally u&s;ed is in their language called <HI>Avie,</HI> the &s;tem of which is tall and &s;trait; though &s;ome of the &s;maller boats are made of the bread-fruit tree, which is a light &s;pongy wood, and ea&s;ily wrought. They &s;mooth the plank very ex|peditiou&s;ly and dexterou&s;ly with their adzes, and can take off a thin coat from a whole plank without mi&s;&s;ing a &s;troke. As they have not the art of warping a plank, every part of the canoe, whether hollow or flat, is &s;haped by hand.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="248">The canoes, or boats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> which are u&s;ed by the inhabitants of this and the neighbouring i&s;lands, may be divided into two general cla&s;&s;es; one of which they call <HI>Ivahahs,</HI> the other <HI>Pahies.</HI></P>
<P>The Ivahah is u&s;ed for &s;hort excur&s;ions to &s;ea, and is wall-&s;ided and flat-bottomed; the Pahie for longer voyages, and is bow-&s;ided and &s;harp-bottomed. The Ivahahs are all of the &s;ame figure, but of different &s;izes, and u&s;ed for different purpo&s;es: their length is from &s;eventy-two feet to ten, but the breadth is by no means in proportion; for tho&s;e of ten feet are about a foot wide, and tho&s;e of more than &s;eventy are &s;carcely two. There is the fighting Ivahah, the fi&s;hing Ivahah, and the travelling Ivahah; for &s;ome of the&s;e go from one i&s;land to another. The fighting Ivahah is by far the longe&s;t, and the head and &s;tern are con&s;iderably rai&s;ed above the body, in a &s;emicircular form; particularly the &s;tern, which is &s;ometimes &s;eventeen or eighteen feet high, though the boat it&s;elf is &s;carcely three. The&s;e never go to &s;ea &s;ingle; but are fa&s;tened together, &s;ide by &s;ide, at the di&s;tance of about three feet, by &s;trong poles of wood, which are laid acro&s;s them and la&s;hed to the gunwales. Upon the&s;e, in the fore|part, a &s;tage or platform is rai&s;ed, about ten or twelve feet long, and &s;omewhat wider than the boats, which is &s;upported by pillars about &s;ix feet high: upon this &s;tage &s;tand the fight|ing men, who&s;e mi&s;&s;ile weapons are &s;lings and &s;pears; for, among other &s;ingularities in the manners of the&s;e people, their bows and arrows are u&s;ed only for diver&s;ion, as we throw quoits: below the&s;e &s;tages &s;it the rowers, who receive from them tho&s;e that are wounded, and furni&s;h fre&s;h men to a&s;cend in their room. Some of the&s;e have a platform of bamboos or other light wood, through their whole length, and con&s;iderably broader, by means of which they will carry
<PB N="222" REF="249">
a great number of men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> but we &s;aw only one fitted in this manner.</P>
<P>The fi&s;hing Ivahahs vary in length from about forty feet to the &s;malle&s;t &s;ize, which is about ten; all that are of the length of twenty-five feet and upwards, of whatever &s;ort, occa&s;ionally carry &s;ail. The travelling Ivahah is always double, and furni&s;hed with a &s;mall neat hou&s;e about five or &s;ix feet broad, and &s;ix or &s;even feet long, which is fa&s;tened upon the fore-part for the convenience of the principal people, who &s;it in them by day, and &s;leep in them at night. The fi&s;hing Ivahahs are &s;ometimes joined together, and have a hou&s;e on board; but this is not common.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which are &s;horter than five and twenty feet, &s;eldom or never carry &s;ail; and, though the &s;tern ri&s;es about four or five feet, have a flat head, and a board that projects for|ward about four feet.</P>
<P>The Pahie is al&s;o of different &s;izes, from &s;ixty to thirty feet long; but, like the Ivahah, is very narrow. One that I mea|&s;ured was fifty-one feet long, and only one foot and a half wide at the top. In the wide&s;t part, it was about three feet; and this is the general proportion. It does not, however, widen by a gradual &s;well; but the &s;ides being &s;trait, and parallel, for a little way below the gunwale, it &s;wells abruptly, and draws to a ridge at the bottom; &s;o that a tran&s;ver&s;e &s;ection of it has &s;omewhat the appearance of the mark upon cards called a Spade, the whole being much wider in proportion to its length. The&s;e, like the large&s;t Ivahahs, are u&s;ed for fighting; but principally for long voyages. The fighting Pahie, which is the large&s;t, is fitted with the &s;tage or platform, which is proportionably larger than tho&s;e of the Ivahah, as their form enables them to &s;u&s;tain a much greater weight. Tho&s;e that are u&s;ed for &s;ailing are generally double; and the middle
<PB N="223" REF="250">
&s;ize are &s;aid to be the be&s;t &s;ea-boats.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> They are &s;ometimes out a month together, going from i&s;land to i&s;land; and &s;ome|times, as we were credibly informed, they are a fortnight or twenty days at &s;ea, and could keep it longer if they had more &s;towage for provi&s;ions, and conveniencies to hold fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>When any of the&s;e boats carry &s;ail &s;ingle, they make u&s;e of a log of wood which is fa&s;tened to the end of two poles that lie cro&s;s the ve&s;&s;el, and project from &s;ix to ten feet, ac|cording to the &s;ize of the ve&s;&s;el, beyond its &s;ide, &s;omewhat like what is u&s;ed by the flying Proa of the Ladrone I&s;lands, and called in the Account of Lord An&s;on's Voyage, an Out|rigger. To this outrigger the &s;hrouds are fa&s;tened, and it is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary in trimming the boat when it blows fre&s;h.</P>
<P>Some of them have one ma&s;t, and &s;ome two; they are made of a &s;ingle &s;tick, and when the length of the canoe is thirty feet, that of the ma&s;t is &s;omewhat le&s;s than five and twenty; it is fixed to a frame that is above the canoe, and receives a &s;ail of matting about one third longer than it&s;elf: the &s;ail is pointed at the top, &s;quare at the bottom, and cur|ved at the &s;ide; &s;omewhat re&s;embling what we call a &s;houl|der of mutton &s;ail, and u&s;e for boats belonging to men of war: it is placed in a frame of wood, which &s;urrounds it on every &s;ide, and has no contrivance either for reefing or furl|ing; &s;o that, if either &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary, it mu&s;t be cut away, which, however, in the&s;e equal climates can &s;el|dom happen. At the top of the ma&s;t are fa&s;tened ornaments of feathers, which are placed inclining obliquely forwards; the &s;hape and po&s;ition of which will be conceived at once from the figure, in one of the cuts.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="251"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE>The oars or paddles that are u&s;ed with the&s;e boats, have a long handle and a flat blade, not unlike a baker's peel. Of the&s;e every per&s;on in the boat has one, except tho&s;e that &s;it under the awning; and they pu&s;h her forward with them at a good rate. The&s;e boats, however, admit &s;o much water at the &s;eams, that one per&s;on at lea&s;t is continually employed in throwing it out. The only thing in which they excel is landing, and putting off from the &s;hore in a &s;urf: by their great length and high &s;terns they land dry, when our boats could &s;carcely land at all; and have the &s;ame advantages in putting off by the height of the head.</P>
<P>The Ivahahs are the only boats that are u&s;ed by the inha|bitants of Otaheite; but we &s;aw &s;everal Pahies that came from other i&s;lands. Of one of the&s;e I &s;hall give the exact dimen&s;ions from a careful admea&s;urement, and then parti|cularly de&s;cribe the manner in which they are built.

<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
to refer to the figure; in which <HI>a a</HI> is the fir&s;t &s;eam, <HI>b b</HI> the &s;econd, and <HI>c c</HI> the third.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tage or keel, under <HI>a a,</HI> is made of a tree hol|lowed out like a trough; for which the longe&s;t trees are cho&s;en that can be got, &s;o that there are never more than three in the whole length: the next &s;tage, under <HI>b b,</HI> is form|ed of &s;trait plank, about four feet long, fifteen inches broad, and two inches thick: the third &s;tage, under <HI>c c,</HI> is, like the bottom made of trunks, hollowed into its bilging form; the la&s;t is al&s;o cut out of trunks, &s;o that the moulding is of one piece with the upright. To form the&s;e parts &s;eparately, with|out &s;aw, plane, chi&s;&s;el, or any other iron tool, may well be thought no ea&s;y ta&s;k; but the great difficulty is to join them together.</P>
<P>When all the parts are prepared, the keel is laid upon blocks, and the planks being &s;upported by &s;tanchions, are &s;ewed or clamped together with &s;trong thongs of plait|ing, which are pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times through holes that are bored with a gouge or auger of bone, that has been de&s;cribed already; and the nicety with which this is done, may be in|ferred from their being &s;ufficiently water-tight for u&s;e with|out caulking. As the plaiting &s;oon rots in the water, it is renewed at lea&s;t once a-year; in order to which, the ve&s;&s;el is taken entirely to pieces. The head and &s;tern are rude with re&s;pect to the de&s;ign; but very neatly fini&s;hed, and poli&s;hed to the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The&s;e Pahies are kept with great care, in a kind of hou&s;e built on purpo&s;e for their reception; the hou&s;es are formed of poles &s;et upright in the ground, the tops of which
<PB N="226" REF="253">
are drawn towards each other,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and fa&s;tened together with their &s;tronge&s;t cord, &s;o as to form a kind of Gothic arch, which is completely thatched quite to the ground, being open only at the ends; they are &s;ometimes fifty or &s;ixty paces long.</P>
<P>As connected with the navigation of the&s;e people, I &s;hall mention their wonderful &s;agacity in foretelling the weather, at lea&s;t the quarter from which the wind &s;hall blow at a fu|ture time; they have &s;everal ways of doing this, of which however I know but one. They &s;ay, that the Milky-way is always curved laterally; but &s;ometimes in one direction, and &s;ometimes in another: and that this curvature is the ef|fect of its being already acted upon by the wind, and its hollow part therefore towards it; &s;o that, if the &s;ame curva|ture continues a night, a corre&s;ponding wind certainly blows the next day. Of their rules, I &s;hall not pretend to judge; but I know that, by whatever means, they can predict the weather, at lea&s;t the wind, with much greater certainty than we can.</P>
<P>In their longer voyages, they &s;teer by the &s;un in the day, and in the night by the &s;tars; all of which they di&s;tingui&s;h &s;eparately by names, and know in what part of the heavens they will appear in any of the months during which they are vi&s;ible in their horizon; they al&s;o know the time of their annual appearing and di&s;appearing with more preci&s;ion than will ea&s;ily be believed by an European a&s;tronomer.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Of the Divi&s;ion of Time in Otaheite; Numeration, Com|putation of Di&s;tance, Language, Di&s;ea&s;es, Di&s;po&s;al of the Dead, Religion, War, Weapons, and Government; with &s;ome general Ob&s;ervations for the U&s;e of future Navigators.</HEAD>
<P>WE were not able to acquire a perfect idea of their method of dividing time; but ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Time.</NOTE> that in &s;peaking of it, either pa&s;t or to come, they never u&s;ed any term but <HI>Malama,</HI> which &s;ignifies Moon. Of the&s;e moons they count thirteen, and then begin again; which is a de|mon&s;tration that they have a notion of the &s;olar year: but how they compute their months &s;o that thirteen of them &s;hall be commen&s;urate with the year, we could not di&s;co|ver; for they &s;ay that each month has twenty-nine days, including one in which the moon is not vi&s;ible. They have names for them &s;eparately, and have frequently told us the fruits that would be in &s;ea&s;on, and the weather that would prevail, in each of them; and they have indeed a name for them collectively, though they u&s;e it only when they &s;peak of the my&s;teries of their religion.</P>
<P>Every day is &s;ubdivided into twelve parts, each of two hours, of which &s;ix belong to the day, and &s;ix to the night. At the&s;e divi&s;ions they gue&s;s pretty nearly by the height of the &s;un while he is above the horizon; but there are few of them that can gue&s;s at them, when he is below it, by the &s;tars.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="255"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Numbers.</NOTE>In numeration they proceed from one to ten, the num|ber of fingers on both hands; and though they have for each number a different name, they generally take hold of their fingers one by one, &s;hifting from one hand to the other till they come to the number they want to expre&s;s. And in other in&s;tances, we ob&s;erved that, when they were conver&s;ing with each other, they joined &s;igns to their words, which were &s;o expre&s;&s;ive that a &s;tranger might ea&s;ily appre|hend their meaning.</P>
<P>In counting from ten they repeat the name of that num|ber, and add the word <HI>more</HI>; ten, and one more, is eleven; ten, and two more, twelve; and &s;o of the re&s;t, as we &s;ay one and twenty, two and twenty. When they come to ten and ten more, they have a new denomination, as we &s;ay a &s;core; and by the&s;e &s;cores they count till they get ten of them, when they have a denomination for two hundred; and we never could di&s;cover that they had any denomination to ex|pre&s;s a greater number: neither, indeed, do they &s;eem to want any; for ten of the&s;e amount to two thou&s;and, a greater number than they can ever apply.</P>
<P>In mea&s;uring di&s;tance they are much more deficient than in computing numbers, having but one term which an&s;wers to fathom; when they &s;peak of di&s;tances from place to place, they expre&s;s it, like the A&s;iatics, by the time that is required to pa&s;s it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE>Their language is &s;oft and melodious; it abounds with vowels, and we ea&s;ily learnt to pronounce it: but found it exceedingly difficult to teach them to pronounce a &s;ingle word of ours; probably not only from its abounding in con|&s;onants, but from &s;ome peculiarity in its &s;tructure; for Spa|ni&s;h and Italian words, if ending in a vowel, they pro|nounced with great facility.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="256">Whether it is copious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> we were not &s;ufficiently acquainted with it to know; but it is certainly very imperfect, for it is almo&s;t totally without inflexion, both of nouns and verbs. Few of the nouns have more than one ca&s;e, and few of the verbs more than one ten&s;e; yet we found no great difficulty in making our&s;elves mutually under&s;tood, however &s;trange it may appear in &s;peculation.</P>
<P>They have, however, certain <HI>affixa,</HI> which, though but few in number, are very u&s;eful to them, and puzzled us ex|tremely.

<P><PB N="231" REF="258">Among people who&s;e food is &s;o &s;imple,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Di&s;ea&s;es.</NOTE> and who in gene|ral are &s;eldom drunk, it is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that there are but few di&s;ea&s;es; we &s;aw no critical di&s;ea&s;e during our &s;tay upon the i&s;land, and but few in&s;tances of &s;ickne&s;s, which were accidental fits of the colic. The natives, how|ever, are afflicted with the ery&s;ipelas, and cutaneous erup|tions of the &s;caly kind, very nearly approaching to a lepro&s;y. Tho&s;e in whom this di&s;temper was far advanced, lived in a &s;tate of &s;eclu&s;ion from all &s;ociety, each in a &s;mall hou&s;e built upon &s;ome unfrequented &s;pot, where they were &s;upplied with provi&s;ions: but whether they had any hope of relief, or langui&s;hed out the remainder of their lives in &s;olitude and de&s;pair, we could not learn. We ob&s;erved al&s;o a few who had ulcers upon different parts of their bodies, &s;ome of which had a very virulent appearance; yet they &s;eemed not much to be regarded by tho&s;e who were afflicted with them, for they were left intirely without application even to keep off the flies.</P>
<P>Where intemperance produces no di&s;ea&s;es, there will be no phy&s;icians by profe&s;&s;ion; yet where there is &s;ufferance, there will always be attempts to relieve; and where the cau&s;e of the mi&s;chief and the remedy are alike unknown, the&s;e will naturally be directed by &s;uper&s;tition: thus it hap|pens, that in this country, and in all others which are not further injured by luxury, or improved by knowlege, the management of the &s;ick falls to the lot of the prie&s;t. The method of cure that is practi&s;ed by the prie&s;ts of Otaheite, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of prayers and ceremonies. When he vi&s;its his patient he repeats certain &s;entences, which appear to be &s;et forms contrived for the occa&s;ion, and at the &s;ame time plaits the leaves of the cocoa-nut into different figures very neatly; &s;ome of the&s;e he fa&s;tens to the fingers and toes of the &s;ick,
<PB N="232" REF="259">
and often leaves behind him a few branches of the <HI>the&s;pecia populnea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> which they call <HI>E'midho:</HI> the&s;e ceremonies are re|peated till the patient recovers or dies. If he recovers, they &s;ay the remedies cured him, if he dies, they &s;ay the di&s;ea&s;e was incurable, in which perhaps they do not much differ from the cu&s;tom of other countries.</P>
<P>If we had judged of their &s;kill in &s;urgery from the dread|ful &s;cars which we &s;ometimes &s;aw, we &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be much &s;uperior to the art not only of their phy&s;icians, but of ours. We &s;aw one man who&s;e face was almo&s;t intirely de&s;troyed, his no&s;e, including the bone, was perfectly flat, and one cheek and one eye were &s;o beaten in, that the hollow would almo&s;t receive a man's fi&s;t, yet no ulcer remained; and our companion, Tupia, had been pierced quite through his body by a &s;pear headed with the bone of the &s;ting-ray, the weapon having entered his back, and come out ju&s;t under his brea&s;t; but except in reducing di&s;locations and fractures, the be&s;t &s;urgeon can contribute very little to the cure of a wound; the blood it&s;elf is the be&s;t vulnerary bal|&s;am, and when the juices of the body are pure, and the pa|tient is temperate, nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary as an aid to Nature in the cure of the wor&s;t wound, than the keeping it clean.</P>
<P>Their commerce with the inhabitants of Europe has, how|ever, already entailed upon them that dreadful cur&s;e which avenged the inhumanities committed by the Spaniards in America, the venereal di&s;ea&s;e. As it is certain that no Euro|pean ve&s;&s;el be&s;ides our own, except the Dolphin, and the two that were under the command of Mon&s;. Bougainville, ever vi&s;ited this i&s;land, it mu&s;t have been brought either by one of them or by us. That it was not brought by the Dolphin, Captain Wallis has demon&s;trated in the account of her
<PB N="233" REF="260">
voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> [vol. I. p. 489, 490.] and nothing is more certain than that when we arrived it had made mo&s;t dreadful ravages in the i&s;land. One of our people contracted it within five days after we went on &s;hore, and by the enquiries among the natives, which this occa&s;ioned, we learnt, when we came to under&s;tand a little of their language, that it had been brought by the ve&s;|&s;els which had been there about fifteen months before us, and had lain on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land. They di&s;tingui&s;hed it by a name of the &s;ame import with <HI>rottenne&s;s,</HI> but of a more exten&s;ive &s;ignification, and de&s;cribed, in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, the &s;ufferings of the fir&s;t victims to its rage, and told us that it cau&s;ed the hair and the nails to fall off, and the fle&s;h to rot from the bones: that it &s;pread a univer&s;al terror and con&s;ternation among them, &s;o that the &s;ick were aban|doned by their neare&s;t relations, le&s;t the calamity &s;hould &s;pread by contagion, and left to peri&s;h alone in &s;uch mi&s;ery as till then had never been known among them. We had &s;ome rea&s;on, however, to hope that they had found out a &s;pecific to cure it: during our &s;tay upon the i&s;land we &s;aw none in whom it had made a great progre&s;s, and one who went from us infected, returned after a &s;hort time in perfect health; and by this it appeared either that the di&s;ea&s;e had cured it&s;elf, or that they were not unacquainted with the virtues of &s;imples, nor implicit dupes to the &s;uper&s;titious follies of their prie&s;ts. We endeavoured to learn the medi|cal qualities which they imputed to their plants, but our knowlege of their language was too imperfect for us to &s;ucceed. If we could have learnt their &s;pecific for the vene|real di&s;ea&s;e, if &s;uch they have, it would have been of great advantage to us, for when we left the i&s;land it had been con|tracted by more than half the people on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible but that, in relating incidents, many parti|culars with re&s;pect to the cu&s;toms, opinions, and works of
<PB N="234" REF="261">
the&s;e people &s;hould be anticipated;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Di&s;po&s;al of Dead.</NOTE> to avoid repetition, therefore, I &s;hall only &s;upply deficiencies. Of the manner of di&s;po&s;ing of their dead, much has been &s;aid already. I mu&s;t more explicitly ob&s;erve that there are two places in which the dead are depo&s;ited; one a kind of &s;hed, where the fle&s;h is &s;uffered to putrefy; the other an enclo&s;ure, with erections of &s;tone, where the bones are afterwards buried. The &s;heds are called TUPAPOW, and the enclo&s;ures Morai. The Morais are al&s;o places of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as a native of Otaheite is known to be dead, the hou&s;e is filled with relations, who deplore their lo&s;s, &s;ome by loud lamentations, and &s;ome by le&s;s clamorous, but more genuine expre&s;&s;ions of grief. Tho&s;e who are in the neare&s;t degree of kindred, and are really affected by the event, are &s;ilent; the re&s;t are one moment uttering pa&s;&s;ionate exclama|tions in a chorus, and the next laughing and talking without the lea&s;t appearance of concern. In this manner the re|mainder of the day on which they a&s;&s;emble is &s;pent, and all the &s;ucceeding night. On the next morning the body is &s;hrouded in their cloth, and conveyed to the &s;ea &s;ide upon a bier, which the bearers &s;upport upon their &s;houlders, at|tended by the prie&s;t, who having prayed over the body, re|peats his &s;entences during the proce&s;&s;ion: when it arrives at the water's edge, it is &s;et down upon the beach; the prie&s;t renews his prayers, and taking up &s;ome of the water in his hands, &s;prinkles it towards the body, but not upon it. It is then carried back forty or fifty yards, and &s;oon after brought again to the beach, where the prayers and &s;prinkling are re|peated: it is thus removed backwards and forwards &s;everal times, and while the&s;e ceremonies have been performing a hou&s;e has been built, and a &s;mall &s;pace of ground railed in. In the center of this hou&s;e, or Tupapow, po&s;ts are &s;et up to &s;upport the bier, which is at length conveyed thither, and
<PB REF="262">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="235" REF="263">
placed upon it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and here the body remains to putrify till the fle&s;h is wholly wa&s;ted from the bones.</P>
<P>The&s;e hou&s;es of corruption are of a &s;ize proportioned to the rank of the per&s;on who&s;e body they are to contain; tho&s;e allotted to the lower cla&s;s are ju&s;t &s;ufficient to cover the bier, and have no railing round them. The large&s;t we ever &s;aw was eleven yards long, and &s;uch as the&s;e are ornamented according to the abilities and inclination of the &s;urviving kindred, who never fail to lay a profu&s;ion of good cloth about the body, and &s;ometimes almo&s;t cover the out&s;ide of the hou&s;e. Garlands of the fruit of the palm-nut or <HI>panda|nus,</HI> and cocoa leaves, twi&s;ted by the prie&s;ts in my&s;terious knots, with a plant called by them <HI>Ethee no Morai,</HI> which is particularly con&s;ecrated to funereal &s;olemnities, are depo&s;ited about the place; provi&s;ion and water are al&s;o left at a little di&s;tance, of which, and of other decorations, a more parti|cular de&s;cription has been given already.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the body is depo&s;ited in the Tupapow, the mourning is renewed. The women a&s;&s;emble, and are led to the door by the neare&s;t relation, who &s;trikes a &s;hark's tooth &s;everal times into the crown of her head: the blood copiou&s;ly follows, and is carefully received upon pieces of linen, which are thrown under the bier. The re&s;t of the women follow this example, and the ceremony is repeated at the interval of two or three days, as long as the zeal and &s;orrow of the parties hold out. The tears al&s;o which are &s;hed upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, are received upon pieces of cloth, and offered as oblations to the dead: &s;ome of the younger people cut off their hair, and that is thrown under the bier with the other offerings. This cu&s;tom is founded upon a notion that the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed, which they believe to exi&s;t in a &s;eparate &s;tate, is hovering about the place where
<PB N="236" REF="264">
the body is depo&s;ited:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> that it ob&s;erves the actions of the &s;ur|vivors, and is gratified by &s;uch te&s;timonies of their affection and grief.</P>
<P>Two or three days after the&s;e ceremonies have been com|menced by the women, during which the men &s;eem to be wholly in&s;en&s;ible of their lo&s;s, they al&s;o begin to perform their part. The neare&s;t relations take it in turn to a&s;&s;ume the dre&s;s, and perform the office which have already been par|ticularly de&s;cribed in the account of Tubourai Tamaide's having acted as chief mourner to an old woman, his rela|tion, who died while we were in the i&s;land. One part of the ceremony, however, which accounts for the running away of the people as &s;oon as this proce&s;&s;ion is in &s;ight, has not been mentioned. The chief mourner carries in his hand a long flat &s;tick, the edge of which is &s;et with &s;hark's teeth, and in a phrenzy, which his grief is &s;uppo&s;ed to have in|&s;pired, he runs at all he &s;ees, and if any of them happen to be overtaken, he &s;trikes them mo&s;t unmercifully with this indented cudgel, which cannot fail to wound them in a dan|gerous manner.</P>
<P>The&s;e proce&s;&s;ions continue at certain intervals for five moons, but are le&s;s and le&s;s frequent, by a gradual diminu|tion, as the end of that time approaches. When it is ex|pired, what remains of the body is taken down from the bier, and the bones having been &s;craped and wa&s;hed very clean, are buried, according to the rank of the per&s;on, either within or without a Morai: if the decea&s;ed was an Earee, or Chief, his &s;kull is not buried with the re&s;t of the bones, but is wrapped up in fine cloth, and put in a kind of box made for that purpo&s;e, which is al&s;o placed in the Morai. This coffer is called <HI>Ewharre no te Orometua,</HI> the hou&s;e of a teacher or ma&s;ter. After this the mourning cea&s;es, except &s;ome of
<PB N="237" REF="265">
the women continue to be really afflicted for the lo&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> and in that ca&s;e they will &s;ometimes &s;uddenly wound them&s;elves with the &s;hark's tooth wherever they happen to be: this per|haps will account for the pa&s;&s;ion of grief in which Terapo wounded her&s;elf at the fort; &s;ome accidental circum&s;tance might forcibly revive the remembrance of a friend or rela|tion whom &s;he had lo&s;t, with a pungency of regret and ten|derne&s;s which forced a vent by tears, and prompted her to a repetition of the funereal rite.</P>
<P>The ceremonies, however, do not cea&s;e with the mourn|ing: prayers are &s;till &s;aid by the prie&s;t, who is well paid by the &s;urviving relations, and offerings made at the Morai. Some of the things, which from time to time are depo&s;ited there, are emblematical: a young plantain repre&s;ents the decea&s;ed, and the bunch of feathers the deity who is in|voked. The prie&s;t places him&s;elf over-again&s;t the &s;ymbol of the God, accompanied by &s;ome of the relations, who are furni&s;hed with a &s;mall offering, and repeats his orai&s;on in a &s;et form, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;eparate &s;entences; at the &s;ame time weaving the leaves of the cocoa-nut into different forms, which he afterwards depo&s;its upon the ground where the bones have been interred; the deity is then addre&s;&s;ed by a &s;hrill &s;creech, which is u&s;ed only upon that occa&s;ion. When the prie&s;t retires, the tuft of feathers is removed, and the provi&s;ions left to putrify, or be devoured by the rats.</P>
<P>Of the religion of the&s;e people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion.</NOTE> we were not able to ac|quire any clear and con&s;i&s;tent knowlege: we found it like the religion of mo&s;t other countries, involved in my&s;tery, and perplexed with apparent incon&s;i&s;tences. The religious language is al&s;o here, as it is in China, different from that which is u&s;ed in common; &s;o that Tupia, who took great pains to in&s;truct us, having no words to expre&s;s his mean|ing
<PB N="238" REF="266">
which we under&s;tood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> gave us lectures to very little purpo&s;e: what we learnt, however, I will relate with as much per&s;picuity as I can.</P>
<P>Nothing is more obvious to a rational being, however ig|norant or &s;tupid, than that the univer&s;e and its various parts, as far as they fall under his notice, were produced by &s;ome agent inconceivably more powerful than him&s;elf; and no|thing is more difficult to be conceived, even by the mo&s;t &s;a|gacious and knowing, than the production of them from nothing, which among us is expre&s;&s;ed by the word <HI>Creation.</HI> It is natural therefore, as no Being apparently capable of producing the univer&s;e is to be &s;een, that he &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide in &s;ome di&s;tant part of it, or to be in his nature invi&s;ible, and that he &s;hould have originally produced all that now exi&s;ts in a manner &s;imilar to that in which nature is renovated by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of one genera|tion to another; but the idea of procreation includes in it that of two per&s;ons, and from the conjunction of two per&s;ons the&s;e people imagine every thing in the univer&s;e either ori|ginally or derivatively to proceed.</P>
<P>The Supreme Deity, one of the&s;e two fir&s;t beings, they call TAROATAIHETOOMOO, and the other, whom they &s;uppo&s;e to have been a rock, TEPAPA. A daughter of the&s;e was TETTOWMATATAYO, the year, or thirteen months collectively, which they never name but upon this occa&s;ion, and &s;he, by the common father, produced the months, and the months, by conjunction with each other, the days: the &s;tars they &s;uppo&s;e partly to be the immediate offspring of the fir&s;t pair, and partly to have increa&s;ed among them&s;elves; and they have the &s;ame notion with re&s;pect to the different &s;pecies of plants. Among other progeny of Taroataihetoomoo and Tepapa, they &s;uppo&s;e an inferior race of deities whom they call

EATUAS. Two of the&s;e Eatuas, they &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> at &s;ome remote pe|riod of time, inhabited the earth, and were the parents of the fir&s;t man. When this man, their common ance&s;tor, was born, they &s;ay that he was round like a ball, but that his mother, with great care, drew out his limbs, and having at length moulded him into his pre&s;ent form, &s;he called him EOTHE, which &s;ignifies <HI>fini&s;hed.</HI> That being prompted by the univer&s;al in&s;tinct to propagate his kind, and being able to find no female but his mother, he begot upon her a daughter, and upon the daughter other daughters for &s;everal generations, before there was a &s;on; a &s;on, however, being at length born, he, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;i&s;ters, peopled the world.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides their daughter Tettowmatatayo, the fir&s;t progenitors of nature had a &s;on whom they called TANE. Taroatai|hetoomoo, the Supreme Deity, they emphatically &s;tile the cau&s;er of earthquakes; but their prayers are more generally addre&s;&s;ed to Tane, whom they &s;uppo&s;e to take a greater part in the affairs of mankind.</P>
<P>Their &s;ubordinate deities or Eatuas, which are numerous, are of both &s;exes: the male are wor&s;hipped by the men, and the female by the women; and each have Morais to which the other &s;ex is not admitted, though they have al&s;o Morais common to both. Men perform the office of prie&s;t to both &s;exes, but each &s;ex has its prie&s;ts, for tho&s;e who officiate for one &s;ex, do not officiate for the other.</P>
<P>They believe the immortality of the &s;oul, at lea&s;t its exi&s;tence in a &s;eparate &s;tate, and that there are two &s;itu|ations of different degrees of happine&s;s, &s;omewhat ana|logous to our heaven and hell: the &s;uperior &s;ituation they call <HI>Tavirua Perai,</HI> the other <HI>Tiahoboo.</HI> They do not, how|ever, con&s;ider them as places of reward and puni&s;hment,
<PB N="240" REF="268">
but as receptacles for different cla&s;&s;es;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> the fir&s;t, for their Chiefs and principal people, the other for tho&s;e of inferior rank, for they do not &s;uppo&s;e that their actions here in the lea&s;t influence their future &s;tate, or indeed that they come under the cognizance of their deities at all. Their religion, therefore, if it has no influence upon their morals, is at lea&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted; and their expre&s;&s;ions of adoration and reve|rence, whether by words or actions, ari&s;e only from a humble &s;en&s;e of their own inferiority, and the ineffable ex|cellence of divine perfection.</P>
<P>The character of the prie&s;t or Tahowa, is hereditary: the cla&s;s is numerous, and con&s;i&s;ts of all ranks of people; the chief, however, is generally the younger brother of a good family, and is re&s;pected in a degree next to their kings. Of the little knowlege that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in this country, the prie&s;ts have the greate&s;t &s;hare; but it con&s;i&s;ts principally in an acquaintance with the names and ranks of the different Eatuas or &s;ubordinate divinities, and the opinions concerning the origin of things, which have been traditionally pre&s;erved among the order in detached &s;entences, of which &s;ome will repeat an incredible number, though but very few of the words that are u&s;ed in their common dialect occur in them.</P>
<P>The prie&s;ts, however, are &s;uperior to the re&s;t of the people in the knowlege of navigation and a&s;tronomy, and indeed the name Tahowa &s;ignifies nothing more than a man of knowlege. As there are prie&s;ts of every cla&s;s, they officiate only among that cla&s;s to which they belong: the prie&s;t of the inferior cla&s;s is never called upon by tho&s;e of &s;uperior rank, nor will the prie&s;t of the &s;uperior rank officiate for any of the inferior cla&s;s.</P>
<P>Marriage in this i&s;land, as appeared to us, is nothing more than an agreement between the man and woman, with
<PB N="241" REF="269">
which the prie&s;t has no concern.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> Where it is contracted it appears to be pretty well kept, though &s;ometimes the parties &s;eparate by mutual con&s;ent, and in that ca&s;e a divorce takes place with as little trouble as the marriage.</P>
<P>But though the prie&s;thood has laid the people under no tax for a nuptial benediction, there are two operations which it has appropriated, and from which it derives con&s;iderable advantages. One is <HI>tattowing,</HI> and the other circumci&s;ion, though neither of them have any connexion with religion. The tattowing has been de&s;cribed already. Circumci&s;ion has been adopted merely from motives of cleanline&s;s; it cannot indeed properly be called circumci&s;ion, becau&s;e the <HI>prepuce</HI> is not mutilated by a circular wound, but only &s;lit through the upper part to prevent its contracting over the <HI>glans.</HI> As neither of the&s;e can be performed by any but a prie&s;t, and as to be without either is the greate&s;t di&s;grace, they may be con&s;idered as a claim to &s;urplice fees like our marriages and chri&s;tenings, which are cheerfully and libe|rally paid, not according to any &s;ettled &s;tipend, but the rank and abilities of the parties or their friends.</P>
<P>The Morai, as has already been ob&s;erved, is at once a burying ground and a place of wor&s;hip, and in this parti|cular our churches too much re&s;emble it. The Indian, how|ever, approaches his Morai with a reverence and humility that di&s;graces the chri&s;tian, not becau&s;e he holds any thing &s;acred that is there, but becau&s;e he there wor&s;hips an invi|&s;ible divinity, for whom, though he neither hopes for reward, nor fears puni&s;hment, at his hand, he always expre&s;&s;es the profounde&s;t homage and mo&s;t humble adoration. I have al|ready given a very particular de&s;cription both of the Morais and the altars that are placed near them. When an Indian is
<PB N="242" REF="270">
about to wor&s;hip at the Morai,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> or brings his offering to the altar, he always uncovers his body to the wa&s;te, and his looks and attitude are &s;uch as &s;ufficiently expre&s;s a corre|&s;ponding di&s;po&s;ition of mind.</P>
<P>It did not appear to us that the&s;e people are, in any in|&s;tance, guilty of idolatry; at lea&s;t they do not wor&s;hip any thing that is the work of their hands, nor any vi&s;ible part of the creation. This i&s;land indeed, and the re&s;t that lie near it, have a particular bird, &s;ome a heron, and others a king's fi&s;her, to which they pay a peculiar regard, and con|cerning which they have &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious notions with re&s;pect to good and bad fortune, as we have of the &s;wallow and robin-red-brea&s;t, giving them the name of EATUA, and by no means killing or mole&s;ting them; yet they never addre&s;s a petition to them, or approach them with any act of adoration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE>Though I dare not a&s;&s;ert that the&s;e people, to whom the art of writing, and con&s;equently the recording of laws, are utterly unknown, live under a regular form of govern|ment; yet a &s;ubordination is e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, that greatly re&s;embles the early &s;tate of every nation in Europe under the feudal &s;y&s;tem, which &s;ecured liberty in the mo&s;t licentious exce&s;s to a few, and entailed the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery upon the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Their orders are, <HI>Earee rahie,</HI> which an&s;wers to king; <HI>Earee,</HI> baron; <HI>Manahouni,</HI> va&s;&s;al; and <HI>Toutou,</HI> villain. The Earee rahie, of which there are two in this i&s;land, one being the &s;overeign of each of the penin&s;ulas of which it con&s;i&s;ts, is treated with great re&s;pect by all ranks, but did not appear to us to be inve&s;ted with &s;o much power as was exerci&s;ed by the Earees in their own di&s;tricts; nor indeed did we, as I have
<PB N="243" REF="271">
before ob&s;erved, once &s;ee the &s;overeign of Obereonoo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> while we were in the i&s;land. The Earees are lords of one or more of the di&s;tricts into which each of the penin&s;ulas is divided, of which there may be about one hundred in the whole i&s;land; and they parcel out their territories to the Manahou|nies, who cultivate each his part which he holds under the baron. The lowe&s;t cla&s;s, called Toutous, &s;eem to be nearly under the &s;ame circum&s;tances as the villains in feudal go|vernments: the&s;e do all the laborious work, they cultivate the land under the Manahounies, who are only nominal culti|vators for the lord, they fetch wood and water, and, under the direction of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family, dre&s;s the victuals; they al&s;o catch the fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Each of the Earees keeps a kind of court, and has a great number of attendants, chiefly the younger brothers of their own tribe; and among the&s;e &s;ome hold particular offices, but of what nature exactly we could not tell. One was called the <HI>Eowa no l' Earee,</HI> and another the <HI>Whanno no l' Earee,</HI> and the&s;e were frequently di&s;patched to us with me&s;&s;ages. Of all the courts of the&s;e Earees, that of Tootahah was the mo&s;t &s;plendid, as indeed might rea&s;onably be expected, becau&s;e he admini&s;tered the government for Outou, his nephew, who was Earee rahie of Obereonoo, and lived upon his e&s;tate. The child of the baron or Earee, as well as of the &s;overeign or Earee rahie, &s;ucceeds to the title and honours of the father as &s;oon as it is born: &s;o that a baron, who was ye&s;terday called Earee, and was approached with the ceremony of lowering the garments, &s;o as to uncover the upper part of the body, is to-day, if his wife was la&s;t night delivered of a child, reduced to the rank of a private man, all marks of re&s;pect being transferred to the child, if it is &s;uffered to live,
<PB N="244" REF="272">
though the father &s;till continues po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or and admini&s;trator of his e&s;tate:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> probably this cu&s;tom has its &s;hare, among other inducements, in forming the &s;ocieties called Arreoy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War.</NOTE>If a general attack happens to be made upon the i&s;land, every di&s;trict under the command of an Earee, is obliged to furni&s;h its proportion of &s;oldiers for ther common defence. The number furni&s;hed by the principal di&s;tricts, which Tupia recollected, when added together, amounted, as I have ob|&s;erved before, to &s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and eighty.</P>
<P>Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, the united force of the whole i&s;land is commanded in chief by the Earee rahie. Private dif|ferences between two Earees, are decided by their own people, without at all di&s;turbing the general tranquillity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Weapons.</NOTE>Their weapons are &s;lings, which they u&s;e with great dex|terity, pikes headed with the &s;tings of &s;ting-rays, and clubs, of about &s;ix or &s;even feet long, made of a very hard heavy wood. Thus armed, they are &s;aid to fight with great ob|&s;tinacy, which is the more likely to be true, as it is certain that they give no quarter to either man, woman, or child, who is &s;o unfortunate as to fall into their hands during the battle, or for &s;ome hours afterwards, till their pa&s;&s;ion, which is always violent, though not la&s;ting, has &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>The Earee rahie of Obereonoo, while we were here, was in perfect amity with the Earee rahie of Tiarreboo, the other penin&s;ula, though he took him&s;elf the title of king of the whole i&s;land: this, however, produced no more jealou&s;y in the other &s;overeign, than the title of king of France, a&s;&s;umed by our &s;overeign, does in his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty.</P>
<P>In a government &s;o rude, it cannot be expected that di&s;tri|butive ju&s;tice &s;hould be regularly admini&s;tered, and indeed
<PB N="245" REF="273">
where there is &s;o little oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> in con&s;equence of the facility with which every appetite and pa&s;&s;ion is gra|tified, there can be but few crimes. There is nothing like money, the common medium by which every want and every wi&s;h is &s;uppo&s;ed to be gratified by tho&s;e who do not po&s;&s;e&s;s it; there is no apparently permanent good which either fraud or force can unlawfully obtain; and when all the crimes that are committed by the inhabitants of civilized countries, to get money, are &s;et out of the account, not many will remain: add to this, that where the commerce with woman is re&s;trained by no law, men will &s;eldom be under any temptation to commit adultery, e&s;pecially as one woman is always le&s;s preferred to another, where they are le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by per&s;onal decorations, and the adventi|tious circum&s;tances which are produced by the varieties of art, and the refinements of &s;entiment. That they are thieves is true; but as among the&s;e people no man can be much injured or benefited by theft, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to re|&s;train it by &s;uch puni&s;hments, as in other countries are ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the very exi&s;tence of civil &s;ociety. Tupia, however, tells us, that adultery is &s;ometimes committed as well as theft. In all ca&s;es where an injury has been com|mitted, the puni&s;hment of the offender lies with the &s;uf|ferer: adultery, if the parties are caught in the fact, is &s;ometimes puni&s;hed with death in the fir&s;t ardour of re&s;ent|ment; but without circum&s;tances of immediate provocation, the female &s;inner &s;eldom &s;uffers more than a beating. As puni&s;hment, however, is enforced by no law, nor taken into the hand of any magi&s;trate, it is not often inflicted, except the injured party is the &s;tronge&s;t; though the Chiefs do &s;ometimes puni&s;h their immediate dependents, for faults committed again&s;t each other, and even the dependents of
<PB N="246" REF="274">
others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> if they are accu&s;ed of any offence committed in their di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Having now given the be&s;t de&s;cription that I can of the i&s;land in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, and of the people, with their cu&s;|toms and manners, language and arts, I &s;hall only add a few general ob&s;ervations, which may be of u&s;e to future na|vigators, if any of the &s;hips of Great Britain &s;hould receive orders to vi&s;it it. As it produces nothing that appears to be convertible into an article of trade, and can be u&s;eful only by affording refre&s;hments to &s;hipping in their pa&s;&s;age through the&s;e &s;eas, it might be made to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e in a much greater degree, by tran&s;porting thither &s;heep, goats, and horned cattle, with European garden-&s;tuff, and other u&s;eful vegetables, which there is the greate&s;t rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e will flouri&s;h in &s;o fine a climate, and &s;o rich a &s;oil.</P>
<P>Though this, and the neighbouring i&s;lands lie within the tropick of Capricorn, yet the heat is not trouble&s;ome, nor did the winds blow con&s;tantly from the ea&s;t. We had fre|quently a fre&s;h gale from the S. W. for two or three days, and &s;ometimes, though very &s;eldom, from the N. W. Tupia reported, that &s;outh we&s;terly winds prevail in October, No|vember, and December, and we have no doubt of the fact. When the winds are variable, they are always accompanied by a &s;well from the S. W. or W. S. W.; there is al&s;o a &s;well from the &s;ame points when it is calm, and the atmo&s;phere loaded with clouds, which is a &s;ure indication that the winds are variable, or we&s;terly out at &s;ea, for with the &s;ettled trade-wind the weather is clear.</P>
<P>The meeting with we&s;terly winds, within the general li|mits of the ea&s;tern trade, has induced &s;ome navigators to &s;uppo&s;e that they were near &s;ome large track of land, of which, however, I think they are no indication.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="275">It has been found, both by us and the Dolphin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> that the trade-wind, in the&s;e parts, does not extend farther to the &s;outh than twenty degrees, beyond which, we generally found a gale from the we&s;tward; and it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that when the&s;e winds blow &s;trong, they will drive back the ea&s;terly wind, and con&s;equently incroach upon the limits within which they con&s;tantly blow, and thus nece&s;|&s;arily produce variable winds, as either happens to prevail, and a &s;outh we&s;terly &s;well. This &s;uppo&s;ition is the more probable, as it is well known that the trade-winds blow but faintly for &s;ome di&s;tance within their limits, and therefore may be more ea&s;ily &s;topped or repelled by a wind in the con|trary direction: it is al&s;o well known, that the limits of the trade-winds vary not only at different &s;ea&s;ons of the year, but &s;ometimes at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, in different years.</P>
<P>There is therefore no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;outh we&s;terly winds, within the&s;e limits, are cau&s;ed by the vicinity of large tracts of land, e&s;pecially as they are always accom|panied with a large &s;well, in the &s;ame direction in which they blow; and we find a much greater &s;urf beating upon the &s;hores of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;lands that are &s;itu|ated ju&s;t within the limits of the trade-wind, than upon any other part of them.</P>
<P>The tides about the&s;e i&s;lands, are perhaps as incon&s;iderable as in any part of the world. A &s;outh or S. by W. moon, makes high water in the bay of Matavai at Otaheite; but the water very &s;eldom ri&s;es perpendicularly above ten or twelve inches.</P>
<P>The variation of the compa&s;s, I found to be 40&deg; 46&prime; Ea&s;terly, this being the re&s;ult of a great number of trials made with four of Dr. Knight's needles, adapted to azimuth compa&s;&s;es.
<PB N="248" REF="276">
The&s;e compa&s;&s;es I thought the be&s;t that could be procured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769.</NOTE> yet, when applied to the meridian line, I found them to differ not only one from another, &s;ometimes a degree and an half, but the &s;ame needle, half a degree from it&s;elf in dif|ferent trials made on the &s;ame day; and I do not remember that I have ever found two needles which exactly agreed at the &s;ame time and place, though I have often found the &s;ame needle agree with it&s;elf, in &s;everal trials made one after the other. This imperfection of the needle, however, is of no con&s;equence to navigation, as the variation can always be found to a degree of accuracy, more than &s;ufficient for all nautical purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>AFTER parting with our friends, we made an ea&s;y &s;ail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Thur&s;day 13.</NOTE> with gentle breezes and clear weather, and were in|formed by Tupia, that four of the neighbouring i&s;lands, which he di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of HUAHEINE, ULIETEA, OTAHA, and BOLABOLA, lay at the di&s;tance of between one and two days &s;ail from Otaheite; and that hogs, fowls, and other refre&s;hments, with which we had of late been but &s;paringly &s;upplied, were there to be procured in great plenty; but having di&s;covered from the hills of Ota|heite, an i&s;land lying to the northward, which he called TETHUROA, I determined fir&s;t to &s;tand that way, to take a nearer view of it. It lies N. &frac12; W. di&s;tant eight leagues from the northern extremity of Otaheite, upon which we had ob|&s;erved the tran&s;it, and to which we had, for that rea&s;on, given the name of POINT VENUS. We found it to be a &s;mall low i&s;land, and were told by Tupia, that it had no &s;ettled inhabitants, but was occa&s;ionally vi&s;ited by the inhabitants of Otaheite, who &s;ometimes went thither for a few days to fi&s;h; we therefore determined to &s;pend no more time in a farther examination of it, but to go in &s;earch of Huaheine and Ulietea, which he de&s;cribed to be well peopled, and as large as Otaheite.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 15.</NOTE>On the 15th, it was hazy, with light breezes and calms &s;ucceeding each other, &s;o that we could &s;ee no land, and made but little way. Our Indian, Tupia, often prayed for a wind to his god Tane, and as often boa&s;ted of his &s;uc|ce&s;s, which indeed he took a very effectual method to &s;ecure, for he never began his addre&s;s to Tane, till he &s;aw a breeze &s;o near that he knew it mu&s;t reach the &s;hip before his orai&s;on was well over.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 16.</NOTE>On the 16th, we had a gentle breeze; and in the morning about eight o'clock, being clo&s;e in with the north we&s;t part of the i&s;land Huaheine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Huaheine.</NOTE> we &s;ounded, but had no bottom with 80 fathom. Some canoes very &s;oon came off, but the people &s;eemed afraid, and kept at a di&s;tance till they di&s;covered Tu|pia, and then they ventured nearer. In one of the canoes that came up to the &s;hip's &s;ide, was the king of the i&s;land and his wife. Upon a&s;&s;urances of friend&s;hip, frequently and earne&s;tly repeated, their Maje&s;ties and &s;ome others came on board. At fir&s;t they were &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment, and wondered at every thing that was &s;hewn them; yet they made no enquiries, and &s;eeming to be &s;atisfied with what was offered to their notice, they made no &s;earch after other objects of curio&s;ity, with which it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e a building of &s;uch novelty and magnitude as the &s;hip mu&s;t abound. After &s;ome time, they became more familiar. I

To this I readily con&s;ented; and he was Cookee, for &s;o he pronounced my name, and I was Oree, for the re&s;t of the time we were together. We found the&s;e people to be very nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Otaheite, in per&s;on, dre&s;s, language, and every other circum&s;tance, ex|cept, if Tupia might be believed, that they would not &s;teal.</P>
<P>Soon after dinner, we came to an anchor, in a &s;mall but excellent harbour on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, which the Natives call OWHARRE, in eighteen fathom water, clear ground, and &s;ecure from all winds. I went immediately a|&s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Monk|hou&s;e, Tupia, King Cookee, and &s;ome other of the natives who had been on board ever &s;ince the morning. The mo|ment we landed Tupia &s;tripped him&s;elf as low as the wai&s;t, and de&s;ired Mr. Monkhou&s;e to do the &s;ame: he then &s;at down before a great number of the natives, who were col|lected together in a large hou&s;e or &s;hed; for here, as well as at Otaheite, a hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts only of a roof &s;upported upon poles; the re&s;t of us, by his de&s;ire, &s;tanding behind. He then began a &s;peech or prayer which la&s;ted about a quarter of an hour, the King who &s;tood over again&s;t him every now and then an&s;wering in what appeared to be &s;et re&s;pon&s;es. In the cour&s;e of this harangue he delivered at different times two handkerchiefs, a black &s;ilk neckcloth, &s;ome beads, two &s;mall bunches of feathers, and &s;ome plantains, as pre&s;ents to their Eatua, or God. In return for the&s;e, he received for our Eatua, a hog, &s;ome young plantains, and two &s;mall bunches of feathers, which he ordered to be carried on board the &s;hip. After the&s;e ceremonies, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ratification of a treaty between us, every one was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
<PB N="252" REF="283">
to go whither he plea&s;ed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July.</NOTE> and Tupia immediately repaired to offer his oblations at one of the Morais.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 17.</NOTE>The next morning, we went on &s;hore again, and walked up the hills, where the productions were exactly the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Otaheite, except that the rocks and clay appeared to be more burnt. The hou&s;es were neat, and the boat|hou&s;es remarkably large; one that we mea&s;ured was fifty paces long, ten broad, and twenty-four feet high; the whole formed a pointed arch, like tho&s;e of our old cathedrals, which was &s;upported on one &s;ide by twenty-&s;ix, and on the other by thirty pillars, or rather po&s;ts, about two feet high, and one thick, upon mo&s;t of which were rudely carved the heads of men, and &s;everal fanciful devices, not altogether unlike tho&s;e which we &s;ometimes &s;ee printed from wooden blocks, at the beginning and end of old books. The plains, or flat part of the country, abounded in bread-fruit, and cocoa-nut trees; in &s;ome places, however, there were &s;alt &s;wamps and lagoons, which would produce neither.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 18.</NOTE>We went again a-&s;hore on the 18th, and would have taken the advantage of Tupia's company, in our perambulation; but he was too much engaged with his friends: we took however his boy, who&s;e name was TAYETO, and Mr. Banks went to take a farther view of what had much engaged his attention before; it was a kind of che&s;t or ark, the lid of which was nicely &s;ewed on, and thatched very neatly with palm-nut leaves: it was fixed upon two poles, and &s;up|ported on little arches of wood, very neatly carved; the u&s;e of the poles &s;eemed to be to remove it from place to place, in the manner of our &s;edan chairs: in one end of it was a &s;quare hole, in the middle of which was a ring touching the &s;ides, and leaving the angles open, &s;o as to form a round hole within a &s;quare one. The fir&s;t time Mr. Banks &s;aw this cof|fer,

the aperture at the end was &s;topped with a piece of cloth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Tue&s;day 18.</NOTE> which, lea&s;t he &s;hould give offence, he left untouched; pro|bably there was then &s;omething within, but now the cloth was taken away, and, upon looking into it, it was found empty. The general re&s;emblance between this repo&s;itory and the Ark of the Lord among the Jews is remarkable; but it is &s;till more remarkable, that upon enquiring of the boy what it was called, he &s;aid, <HI>Ewharre no Eatua,</HI> the <HI>hou&s;e of the God:</HI> he could however give no account of its &s;ignification or u&s;e. We had commenced a kind of trade with the natives, but it went on &s;lowly; for when any thing was offered, not one of them would take it upon his own judgment, but col|lected the opinions of twenty or thirty people, which could not be done without great lo&s;s of time. We got, however, eleven pigs, and determined to try for more the next day.</P>
<P>The next day, therefore, we brought out &s;ome hatchets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> for which we hoped we &s;hould have had no occa&s;ion, upon an i&s;land which no European had ever vi&s;ited before. The&s;e procured us three very large hogs; and as we propo&s;ed to fail in the afternoon, King Oree and &s;everal others came on board to take their leave. To the King I gave a &s;mall plate of pewter, on which was &s;tamped this in&s;cription, <Q>His Bri|tannic Maje&s;ty's &s;hip, Endeavour, Lieutenant Cook Com|mander, 16th July 1769, Huaheine.</Q> I gave him al&s;o &s;ome medals or counters, re&s;embling the coin of England, &s;truck in the year 1761, with &s;ome other pre&s;ents; and he promi&s;ed that with none of the&s;e, particularly the plate, he would ever part. I thought it as la&s;ting a te&s;timony of our having fir&s;t di&s;covered this i&s;land, as any we could leave be|hind; and having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our vi&s;itors well &s;atisfied, and in great good-humour, we &s;et &s;ail, about half an hour after two in the afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="286"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE>The i&s;land of Huaheine, or Huahene, is &s;ituated in the la|titude of 16&deg; 43&prime; S. and longitude 150&deg; 52&prime; W. from Green|wich: it is di&s;tant from Otaheite about thirty-one leagues, in the direction of N. 58 W. and is about &s;even leagues in compa&s;s. Its &s;urface is hilly and uneven, and it has a &s;afe and commodious harbour. The harbour, which is called by the natives OWALLE, or OWHARRE, lies on the we&s;t &s;ide, un|der the northermo&s;t high land, and within the north end of the reef, which lies along that &s;ide of the i&s;land; there are two inlets or openings, by which it may be entered, through the reef, about a mile and a half di&s;tant from each other; the &s;outhermo&s;t is the wide&s;t, and on the &s;outh &s;ide of it lies a very &s;mall &s;andy i&s;land.</P>
<P>Huaheine &s;eems to be a month forwarder in its produc|tions than Otaheite, as we found the cocoa-nuts full of ker|nel, and &s;ome of the new bread-fruit fit to eat. Of the cocoa-nuts the inhabitants make a food which they call <HI>Poe,</HI> by mixing them with yams; they &s;crape both fine, and having incorporated the powder, they put it into a wooden trough, with a number of hot &s;tones, by which an oily kind of ha&s;ty pudding is made, that our people reli&s;hed very well, e&s;pe|cially when it was fryed. Mr. Banks found not more than eleven or twelve new plants; but he ob&s;erved &s;ome in&s;ects, and a &s;pecies of &s;corpion which he had not &s;een before.</P>
<P>The inhabitants &s;eem to be larger made, and more &s;tout, than tho&s;e of Otaheite. Mr. Banks mea&s;ured one of the men, and found him to be &s;ix feet three inches and an half high; yet they are &s;o lazy, that he could not per&s;uade any of them to go up the hills with him: they &s;aid, if they were to at|tempt it, the fatigue would kill them. The women were very fair, more &s;o than tho&s;e of Otaheite; and in general, we thought them more hand&s;ome, though none that were
<PB N="255" REF="287">
equal to &s;ome individuals. Both &s;exes &s;eemed to be le&s;s timid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Wedne&s;. 19.</NOTE> and le&s;s curious: it has been ob&s;erved, that they made no enquiries on board the &s;hip; and when we fired a gun, they were frighted indeed, but they did not fall down, as our friends at Otaheite con&s;tantly did when we fir&s;t came among them. For this difference, however, we can ea&s;ily account upon other principles; the people at Huaheine had not &s;een the Dolphin, tho&s;e at Otaheite had. In one, the report of a gun was connected with the idea of in&s;tant de&s;truction; to the other, there was nothing dreadful in it but the appear|ance and the &s;ound, as they had never experienced its power of di&s;pen&s;ing death.</P>
<P>While we were on &s;hore, we found that Tupia had com|mended them beyond their merit, when he &s;aid that they would not &s;teal; for one of them, was detected in the fact. But when he was &s;eized by the hair, the re&s;t, in&s;tead of running away, as the people at Otaheite would have done, gathered round, and enquired what provocation had been given: but this al&s;o may be accounted for without giving them credit for &s;uperior courage; they had no experience of the con&s;equence of European re&s;entment, which the people at Otaheite had in many in&s;tances purcha&s;ed with life. It mu&s;t however be acknowledged, to their honour, that when they under&s;tood what had happened, they &s;howed &s;trong &s;igns of di&s;appro|bation, and pre&s;cribed a good beating for the thief, which was immediately admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>We now made &s;ail for the i&s;land of ULIETEA,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ulietea.</NOTE> which lies S. W. by W. di&s;tant &s;even or eight leagues from Huaheine, and at half an hour after &s;ix in the evening we were within three leagues of the &s;hore, on the ea&s;tern &s;ide. We &s;tood off and on all night, and when the day broke the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 20.</NOTE> we &s;tood in for the &s;hore: we &s;oon after di&s;covered an open|ing
<PB N="256" REF="288">
in the reef which lies before the i&s;land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Thur&s;day 20.</NOTE> within which Tupia told us there was a good harbour. I did not, how|ever, implicitly take his word; but &s;ent the ma&s;ter out in the pinnace to examine it: he &s;oon made the &s;ignal for the &s;hip to follow; we accordingly &s;tood in, and anchored in two and twenty fathom, with &s;oft ground.</P>
<P>The natives &s;oon came off to us in two canoes, each of which brought a woman and a pig. The woman we &s;up|po&s;ed was a mark of confidence, and the pig was a pre&s;ent; we received both with proper acknowledgments, and com|plimented each of the ladies with a &s;pike nail and &s;ome beads, much to their &s;atisfaction. We were told by Tupia, who has always expre&s;&s;ed much fear of the men of Bola|bola, that they have made a conque&s;t of this i&s;land; and that, if we remain here, they will certainly come down to|morrow, and fight us. We determined, therefore, to go on &s;hore without delay, while the day was our own.</P>
<P>I landed in company with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the other Gentlemen, Tupia being al&s;o of the party. He in|troduced us by repeating the ceremonies which he had per|formed at Huaheine, after which I hoi&s;ted an Engli&s;h jack, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this and the three neighbouring i&s;lands, Huaheine, Otaha, and Bolabola, which were all in &s;ight, in the name of his Britannic Maje&s;ty. After this, we took a walk to a great Morai, called TAPODEBOATEA. We found it very different from tho&s;e of Otaheite; for it con&s;i&s;ted only of four walls, about eight feet high, of coral &s;tones, &s;ome of which were of an immen&s;e &s;ize, inclo&s;ing an area of about five and twenty yards &s;quare, which was filled up with &s;maller &s;tones: upon the top of it many planks were &s;et up an end, which were carved in their whole length: at a little di&s;tance we found an altar, or Ewhatta, upon which lay the
<PB N="257" REF="289">
la&s;t oblation or &s;acrifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Thur&s;day 20.</NOTE> a hog of about eighty pounds weight, which had been offered whole, and very nicely roa&s;ted. Here were al&s;o four or five Ewharre-no-Eatua, or hou&s;es of God, to which carriage poles were fitted, like that which we had &s;een at Huaheine. One of the&s;e Mr. Banks ex|amined by putting his hand into it, and found a parcel about five feet long and one thick, wrapped up in matts: he broke a way through &s;everal of the&s;e matts with his fingers, but at length came to one which was made of the fibres of the cocoa-nut, &s;o firmly plaited together that he found it impo&s;|&s;ible to tear it, and therefore was forced to de&s;i&s;t; e&s;pecially as he perceived, that what he had done already gave great offence to our new friends. From hence we went to a long hou&s;e, not far di&s;tant, where among rolls of cloth, and &s;e|veral other things, we &s;aw the model of a canoe, about three feet long, to which were tied eight human jaw-bones: we had already learnt that the&s;e, like &s;calps among the Indians of North America, were trophies of war. Tupia affirmed that they were the jaw-bones of the natives of this i&s;land; if &s;o, they might have been hung up, with the model of a ca|noe, as a &s;ymbol of inva&s;ion, by the warriors of Bolabola, as a memorial of their conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Night now came on apace, but Mr. Banks and Dr. Solan|der continued their walk along the &s;hore, and at a little di&s;|tance &s;aw another Ewharre-no-Eatua, and a tree of the fig kind, the &s;ame as that which Mr. Green had &s;een at Otaheite, in great perfection, the trunk, or rather congeries of the roots of which was forty-two paces in circumference.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 21.</NOTE> having di&s;patched the Ma&s;ter in the long-boat to examine the coa&s;t of the &s;outh part of the i&s;land, and one of the Mates in the yawl, to &s;ound the harbour where the &s;hip lay, I went my&s;elf in the pinnace, to &s;urvey that part
<PB N="258" REF="290">
of the i&s;land which lies to the north.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Friday 21.</NOTE> Mr. Banks and the Gentlemen were again on &s;hore, trading with the natives, and examining the products and curio&s;ities of the country; they &s;aw nothing, however, worthy notice, but &s;ome more jaw-bones, of which they made no doubt but that the account they had heard was true.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 22. Sunday 23. Monday 24.</NOTE>On the 22d and 23d, having &s;trong gales and hazey wea|ther, I did not think it &s;afe to put to &s;ea; but on the 24th, though the wind was &s;till variable, I got under &s;ail, and plyed to the northward within the reef, with a view to go out at a wider opening than that by which I had entered; in doing this, however, I was unexpectedly in the mo&s;t immi|nent danger of &s;triking on the rock: the Ma&s;ter, whom I had ordered to keep continually &s;ounding in the chains, &s;uddenly called out, "two fathom." This alarmed me, for though I knew the &s;hip drew at lea&s;t fourteen feet, and that therefore it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;uch a &s;hoal &s;hould be under her keel; yet the Ma&s;ter was either mi&s;taken, or &s;he went along the edge of a coral rock, many of which, in the neighbourhood of the&s;e i&s;lands, are as &s;teep as a wall.</P>
<P>This harbour or bay is called by the natives OOPOA, and taken in its greate&s;t extent, it is capable of holding any num|ber of &s;hipping. It extends almo&s;t the whale length of the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and is defended from the &s;ea by a reef of coral rocks: the &s;outhermo&s;t opening in this reef, or chan|nel into the harbour, by which we entered, is little more than a cable's length wide; it lies off the ea&s;termo&s;t point of the i&s;land, and may be known by another &s;mall woody i&s;land, which lies a little to the &s;outh ea&s;t of it, called by the people here OATARA.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oatara.</NOTE> Between three and four miles north we&s;t from this i&s;land lie two other i&s;lets, in the &s;ame direc|tion as the reef,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Opururu.</NOTE> of which they are a part, called OPURURU

and TAMOU;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Monday 24. Tamou.</NOTE> between the&s;e lies the other channel into the harbour, through which I went out, and which is a full quar|ter of a mile wide. Still farther to the north we&s;t are &s;ome other &s;mall i&s;lands, near which I am told there is another &s;mall channel into the harbour; but this I know only by report.</P>
<P>The principal refre&s;hments that are to be procured at this part of the i&s;land are, plantains, cocoa-nuts, yams, hogs, and fowls; the hogs and fowls, however, are &s;carce; and the country, where we &s;aw it, is neither &s;o populous, nor &s;o rich in produce as Otaheite, or even Huaheine. Wood and wa|ter may al&s;o be procured here; but the water cannot conve|niently be got at.</P>
<P>We were now again at &s;ea, without having received any interruption from the ho&s;tile inhabitants of Bolabola, whom, notwith&s;tanding the fears of Tupia, we intended to vi&s;it. At four o'clock in the afternoon of the 25th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 25.</NOTE> we were within a league of Otaha, which bore N. 77 W. To the northward of the &s;outh end of that i&s;land, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of it, and &s;ome|thing more than a mile from the &s;hore, lie two &s;mall i&s;lands, called TOAHOUTU and WHENNUAIA; between which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Toahoutu. Whennuaia.</NOTE> Tupia &s;ays, there is a channel into a very good harbour, which lies within the reef, and appearances confirmed his report.</P>
<P>As I di&s;covered a broad channel between Otaha and Bola|bola, I determined rather to go through it, than run to the northward of all; but the wind being right a-head, I got no ground.</P>
<P>Between five and &s;ix in the evening of the 26th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 26.</NOTE> as I was &s;tanding to the northward, I di&s;covered a &s;mall low i&s;land, lying N. by W. or N. N. W. di&s;tant four or five leagues from Bolabola. We were told by Tupia that the name of this
<PB N="260" REF="293">
i&s;land is TUBAI;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Tubai.</NOTE> that it produces nothing but cocoa-nuts, and is inhabited only by three families; though it is vi&s;ited by the inhabitants of the neighbouring i&s;lands, who re&s;ort thi|ther to catch fi&s;h, with which the coa&s;t abounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 27.</NOTE>On the 27th, about noon, the peak of Bolabola bore N. 25 W. and the north end of Otaha, N. 80 W. di&s;tant three leagues. The wind continued contrary all this day and the night following.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 28.</NOTE> On the 28th, at &s;ix in the morning, we were near the entrance of the harbour on the ea&s;t &s;ide of OTAHA,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Otaha.</NOTE> which has been ju&s;t mentioned; and finding that it might be examined without lo&s;ing time, I &s;ent away the Ma&s;ter in the long-boat, with orders to &s;ound it; and, if the wind did not &s;hift in our favour, to land upon the i&s;land, and traffic with the natives for &s;uch refre&s;hments as were to be had. In this boat went Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, who landed upon the i&s;land, and before night purcha&s;ed three hogs, twenty-one fowls, and as many yams and plantains as the boat would hold. Plantains we thought a more u&s;eful re|fre&s;hment even than pork; for they were boiled and &s;erved to the &s;hip's company as bread, and were now the more ac|ceptable as our bread was &s;o full of vermin, that notwith|&s;tanding all po&s;&s;ible care, we had &s;ometimes twenty of them in our mouths at a time, every one of which ta&s;ted as hot as mu&s;tard. The i&s;land &s;eemed to be more barren than Ulietea, but the produce was of the &s;ame kind. The people al&s;o exactly re&s;embled tho&s;e that we had &s;een at the other i&s;lands; they were not numerous, but they flocked about the boat where|ever &s;he went from all quarters, bringing with them what|ever they had to &s;ell. They paid the &s;trangers, of whom they had received an account from Tupia, the &s;ame compliment which they u&s;ed towards their own Kings, uncovering their &s;houlders, and wrapping their garments round their brea&s;ts;
<PB N="261" REF="294">
and were &s;o &s;olicitous to prevent its being neglected by any of their people, that a man was &s;ent with them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Friday 28.</NOTE> who called out to every one they met, telling him what they were, and what he was to do.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I kept plying off and on, waiting for the boat's return; at half an hour after five, not &s;eeing any thing of her, I fired a gun, and after it was dark hoi&s;ted a light; at half an hour after eight, we heard the report of a mu&s;quet, which we an&s;wered with a gun, and &s;oon after the boat came on board. The Ma&s;ter reported, that the harbour was &s;afe and commodious, with good anchorage from twenty-five to &s;ixteen fathom water, clear ground.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the boat was hoi&s;ted in, I made &s;ail to the north|ward, and at eight o'clock in the morning of the 29th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 29.</NOTE> we were clo&s;e under the Peak of Bolabola, which was high, rude, and craggy. As the i&s;land was altogether inacce&s;&s;ible in this part, and we found it impo&s;&s;ible to weather it, we tacked and &s;tood off, then tacked again, and after many trips did not weather the &s;outh end of it till twelve o'clock at night. At eight o'clock the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 30.</NOTE> we di&s;covered an i&s;land, which bore from us N. 63&deg; W. di&s;tant about eight leagues; at the &s;ame time the Peak of Bolabola bore N. &frac12; E. di&s;tant three or four leagues. This i&s;land Tupia called MAU|RUA,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maurua</NOTE> and &s;aid that it was &s;mall, wholly &s;urrounded by a reef, and without any harbour for &s;hipping; but inhabited, and bearing the &s;ame produce as the neighbouring i&s;lands: the middle of it ri&s;es in a high round hill, that may be &s;een at the di&s;tance of ten leagues.</P>
<P>When we were off Bolabola, we &s;aw but few people on the &s;hore, and were told by Tupia that many of the inhabi|tants were gone to Ulietea. In the afternoon we found our|&s;elves nearly the length of the &s;outh end of Ulietea, and to

windward of &s;ome harbours that lay on the we&s;t &s;ide of this i&s;land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. July. Sunday 30.</NOTE> Into one of the&s;e harbours, though we had before been a&s;hore on the other &s;ide of the i&s;land, I intended to put, in order to &s;top a leak which we had &s;prung in the powder room, and to take in more balla&s;t, as I found the &s;hip too light to carry &s;ail upon a wind. As the wind was right again&s;t us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Augu&s;t. Tue&s;day 1.</NOTE> we plied off one of the harbours, and about three o'clock in the afternoon on the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, we came to an anchor in the entrance of the channel leading into it in four|teen fathom water, being prevented from working in, by a tide which &s;et very &s;trong out. We then carried out the kedge-anchor, in order to warp into the harbour; but when this was done, we could not trip the bower-anchor with all the purcha&s;e we could make; we were therefore obliged to lie &s;till all night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 2.</NOTE> and in the morning, when the tide turned, the &s;hip going over the anchor, it tripped of it&s;elf, and we warped the &s;hip into a proper birth with ea&s;e, and moored in twenty-eight fathom, with a &s;andy bottom. While this was doing many of the natives came off to us with hogs, fowls, and plantains, which they parted with at an ea&s;y rate.</P>
<P>When the &s;hip was &s;ecured, I went on &s;hore to look for a proper place to get balla&s;t and water, both which I found in a very convenient &s;ituation.</P>
<P>This day Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander &s;pent on &s;hore very much to their &s;atisfaction; every body &s;eemed to fear and re&s;pect them, placing in them at the &s;ame time the utmo&s;t confidence, behaving as if con&s;cious that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of doing them mi&s;chief, without any propen&s;ity to make u&s;e of it. Men, women and children crowded round them, and followed them wherever they went; but none of them were guilty of the lea&s;t incivility: on the contrary, whenever there happened to be dirt or water in the way, the

men vied with each other to carry them over on their backs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Wedne&s;. 2.</NOTE> They were conducted to the hou&s;es of the principal people, and were received in a manner altogether new: the people, who followed them while they were in their way, ru&s;hed forward as &s;oon as they came to a hou&s;e, and went ha&s;tily in before them, leaving however a lane &s;ufficiently wide for them to pa&s;s. When they entered, they found tho&s;e who had preceded them ranged on each &s;ide of a long matt, which was &s;pread upon the ground, and at the farther end of which &s;at the family: in the fir&s;t hou&s;e they entered they found &s;ome very young women or children, dre&s;&s;ed with the utmo&s;t neatne&s;s, who kept their &s;tation, expecting the &s;trangers to come up to them and make them pre&s;ents, which they did with the greate&s;t plea&s;ure; for prettier children or better dre&s;&s;ed they had never &s;een. One of them was a girl about &s;ix years old; her gown, or upper garment, was red; a large quantity of plaited hair was wound round her head, the or|nament to which they give the name of Tamou, and which they value more than any thing they po&s;&s;e&s;s. She &s;at at the upper end of a matt thirty feet long, upon which none of the &s;pectators pre&s;umed to &s;et a foot, notwith&s;tanding the crowd; and &s;he leaned upon the arm of a well-looking woman about thirty, who was probably her nur&s;e. Our Gentlemen walked up to her, and as &s;oon as they approached, &s;he &s;tretched out her hand to receive the beads which they offered her, and no Prince&s;s in Europe could have done it with a better grace.</P>
<P>The people were &s;o much gratified by the pre&s;ents which were made to the&s;e girls, that when Mr. Banks and Dr. So|lander returned they &s;eemed attentive to nothing but how to oblige them; and in one of the hou&s;es they were, by order of the ma&s;ter, entertained with a dance, different from any that they had &s;een. It was performed by one man, who put
<PB N="264" REF="297">
upon his head a large cylindrical piece of wicker-work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Wedne&s;. 2.</NOTE> or ba&s;ket, about four feet long and eight inches in diameter, which was faced with feathers, placed perpendicularly, with the tops bending forwards, and edged round with &s;hark's teeth, and the tail feathers of Tropic birds: when he had put on this head-dre&s;s, which is called a <HI>Whow,</HI> he began to dance, moving &s;lowly, and often turning his head &s;o as that the top of his high wicker-cap de&s;cribed a circle, and &s;ome|times throwing it &s;o near the faces of the &s;pectators as to make them &s;tart back: this was held among them as a very good joke, and never failed to produce a peal of laughter, e&s;pecially when it was played off upon one of the &s;trangers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 3.</NOTE>On the 3d, we went along the &s;hore to the northward, which was in a direction oppo&s;ite to that of the route Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander had taken the day before, with a de|&s;ign to purcha&s;e &s;tock, which we always found the people more ready to part with, and at a more ea&s;y price, at their hou&s;es than at the market. In the cour&s;e of our walk we met with a company of dancers, who detained us two hours, and during all that time afforded us great entertainment. The company con&s;i&s;ted of two women dancers, and &s;ix men, with three drums; we were informed by Tupia, that they were &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable people of the i&s;land, and that though they were continually going from place to place, they did not, like the little &s;trolling companies of Otaheite, take any gratuity from the &s;pectators. The women had upon their heads a con&s;iderable quantity of Tamou, or plaited hair, which was brought &s;everal times round the head, and adorned in many parts with the flowers of the cape-je&s;&s;a|mine, which were &s;tuck in with much ta&s;te, and made a head-dre&s;s truly elegant. Their necks, &s;houlders, and arms were naked; &s;o were the brea&s;ts al&s;o as low as the parting of

the arm; below that, they were covered with black cloth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 3.</NOTE> which &s;et clo&s;e to the body; at the &s;ide of each brea&s;t, next the arm, was placed a &s;mall plume of black feathers, much in the &s;ame manner as our ladies now wear their no&s;egays or <HI>Bouquets</HI>; upon their hips re&s;ted a quantity of cloth plaited very full, which reached up to the brea&s;t, and fell down below into long petticoats, which quite concealed their feet, and which they managed with as much dexterity as our opera dancers could have done: the plaits above the wai&s;t were brown and white alternately, the petticoats below were all white.</P>
<P>In this dre&s;s they advanced &s;ideways in a mea&s;ured &s;tep, keeping excellent time to the drums, which beat bri&s;kly and loud; &s;oon after they began to &s;hake their hips, giving the folds of cloth that lay upon them a very quick motion, which was in &s;ome degree continued through the whole dance, though the body was thrown into various po&s;tures, &s;ometimes &s;tanding, &s;ometimes &s;itting, and &s;ometimes re&s;t|ing on their knees and elbows, the fingers al&s;o being moved at the &s;ame time with a quickne&s;s &s;carcely to be imagined. Much of the dexterity of the dancers, however, and the en|tertainment of the &s;pectators, con&s;i&s;ted in the wantonne&s;s of their attitudes and ge&s;tures, which was, indeed, &s;uch as exceeds all de&s;cription.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e girls had in her ear three pearls; one of them was very large, but &s;o foul that it was of little value; the other two were as big as a middling pea; the&s;e were clear, and of a good colour and &s;hape, though &s;poiled by the dril|ling. Mr. Banks would fain have purcha&s;ed them, and offered the owner any thing &s;he would a&s;k for them, but &s;he could not be per&s;uaded to part with them at any price: he tempted her with the value of four hogs, and whatever el&s;e
<PB N="266" REF="300">
&s;he &s;hould chu&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Thur&s;day 3.</NOTE> but without &s;ucce&s;s; and indeed they &s;et a value upon their pearls very nearly equal to what they would fetch among us, except they could be procured before they are drilled.</P>
<P>Between the dances of the women, the men performed a kind of dramatic interlude, in which there was dialogue as well as dancing; but we were not &s;ufficiently acquainted with their language to under&s;tand the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 4.</NOTE>On the 4th, &s;ome of our gentlemen &s;aw a much more re|gular entertainment of the dramatic kind, which was divided into four acts.</P>
<P>Tupia had often told us that he had large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in this i&s;land, which had been taken away from him by the inhabitants of Bolabola, and he now pointed them out in the very bay where the &s;hip was at anchor. Upon our going on &s;hore, this was confirmed by the inhabitants, who &s;hewed us &s;everal di&s;tricts or Whennuas, which they acknowledged to be his right.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 5.</NOTE>On the 5th, I received a pre&s;ent of three hogs, &s;ome fowls, &s;everal pieces of cloth, the large&s;t we had &s;een, being fifty yards long, which they unfolded and di&s;played &s;o as to make the greate&s;t &s;how po&s;&s;ible; and a con&s;iderable quantity of plantains, cocoa-nuts, and other refre&s;hments, from Opoony, the formidable king, or, in the language of the country, Earee rahie, of Bolabola, with a me&s;&s;age that he was at this time upon the i&s;land, and that the next day he intended to pay me a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>In the mean time Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went upon the hills, accompanied by &s;everal of the Indians, who con|ducted them by excellent paths, to &s;uch a height, that they plainly &s;aw the other &s;ide of the i&s;land, and the pa&s;&s;age through which the &s;hip had pa&s;&s;ed the reef between the little i&s;lands of Opururu and Tamou, when we landed upon it the

fir&s;t time. As they were returning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Saturday 5.</NOTE> they &s;aw the Indians exerci&s;ing them&s;elves at what they call <HI>Erowhaw,</HI> which is nothing more than pitching a kind of light lance, headed with hard wood, at a mark: in this amu&s;ement, though they &s;eem very fond of it, they do not excel, for not above one in twelve &s;truck the mark, which was the bole of a plantain tree, at about twenty yards di&s;tance.</P>
<P>On the 6th, we all &s;taid at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 6.</NOTE> expecting the vi&s;it of the great king, but we were di&s;appointed; we had, however, much more agreeable company, for he &s;ent three very pretty girls to demand &s;omething in return for his pre&s;ent: perhaps he was unwilling to tru&s;t him&s;elf on board the &s;hip, or per|haps he thought his me&s;&s;engers would procure a more valu|able return for his hogs and poultry than he could him&s;elf; be that as it may, we did not regret his ab&s;ence, nor his me&s;&s;engers their vi&s;it.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, as the great king would not come to us, we determined to go to the great king. As he was lord of the Bolabola men, the conquerors of this, and the terror of all the other i&s;lands, we expected to &s;ee a Chief young and vigorous, with an intelligent countenance, and an enter|pri&s;ing &s;pirit: we found, however, a poor feeble wretch, withered and decrepit, half blind with age, and &s;o &s;luggi&s;h and &s;tupid that he appeared &s;carcely to have under&s;tanding enough left to know that it was probable we &s;hould be gra|tified either by hogs or women. He did not receive us &s;itting, or with any &s;tate or formality as the other Chiefs had done: we made him our pre&s;ent, which he accepted, and gave a hog in return. We had learnt that his principal re&s;i|dence was at Otaha; and upon our telling him that we in|tended to go thither in our boats the next morning, and that
<PB N="268" REF="302">
we &s;hould be glad to have him along with us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t.</NOTE> he promi&s;ed to be of the party.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 7.</NOTE>Early in the morning, therefore, I &s;et out both with the pinnace and long-boat for Otaha, having &s;ome of the gentle|men with me; and in our way we called upon Opoony, who was in his canoe, ready to join us. As &s;oon as we landed at Otaha, I made him a pre&s;ent of an ax, which I thought might induce him to encourage his &s;ubjects to bring us &s;uch provi&s;ion as we wanted; but in this we found our&s;elves &s;adly di&s;appointed, for after &s;taying with him till noon, we left him without being able to procure a &s;ingle article. I then proceeded to the north point of the i&s;land, in the pinnace, having &s;ent the long-boat another way. As I went along I picked up half a dozen hogs, as many fowls, and &s;ome plan|tains and yams. Having viewed and &s;ketched the harbour on this &s;ide of the i&s;land, I made the be&s;t of my way back, with the long-boat, which joined me &s;oon after it was dark; and about ten o'clock at night we got on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>In this excur&s;ion Mr. Banks was not with us; he &s;pent the morning on board the &s;hip, trading with the natives, who came off in their canoes, for provi&s;ions and curio&s;ities; and in the afternoon he went on &s;hore with his draught&s;man, to &s;ketch the dre&s;&s;es of the dancers which he had &s;een a day or two before. He found the company exactly the &s;ame, ex|cept that another woman had been added to it: the dancing al&s;o of the women was the &s;ame, but the interludes of the men were &s;omewhat varied; he &s;aw five or &s;ix performed, which were different from each other, and very much re|&s;embled the drama of our &s;tage dances.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 8.</NOTE> The next day, he went a&s;hore again, with Dr. Solander, and they directed their cour&s;e towards the dancing company, which, from the
<PB N="269" REF="303">
time of our &s;econd landing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Tue&s;day 8.</NOTE> had gradually moved about two leagues in their cour&s;e round the i&s;land. They &s;aw more dancing and more interludes, the interludes &s;till vary|ing from each other: in one of them the performers, who were all men, were divided into two parties, which were di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other by the colour of their cloaths, one being brown, and the other white. The brown party repre&s;ented a ma&s;ter and &s;ervants, and the white party a company of thieves: the ma&s;ter gave a ba&s;ket of meat to the re&s;t of his party, with a charge to take care of it: the dance of the white party con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal expedients to &s;teal it, and that of the brown party in preventing their &s;ucce&s;s. After &s;ome time, tho&s;e who had charge of the ba&s;ket placed them&s;elves round it, upon the ground, and leaning upon it, appeared to go to &s;leep; the others, improving this opportu|nity, came gently upon them, and lifting them up from the ba&s;ket, carried off their prize: the &s;leepers &s;oon after awak|ing, mi&s;&s;ed their ba&s;ket, but pre&s;ently fell a dancing, without any farther regarding their lo&s;s; &s;o that the dramatic action of this dance was, according to the &s;evere&s;t laws of critici&s;m, one, and our lovers of &s;implicity would here have been gra|tified with an entertainment perfectly &s;uited to the cha&s;tity of their ta&s;te.</P>
<P>On the 9th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 9.</NOTE> having &s;pent the morning in trading with the canoes, we took the opportunity of a breeze, which &s;prung up at Ea&s;t, and having &s;topped our leak, and got the fre&s;h &s;tock which we had purcha&s;ed on board, we &s;ailed out of the harbour. When we were &s;ailing away, Tupia &s;trongly urged me to fire a &s;hot towards Bolabola, po&s;&s;ibly as a mark of his re&s;entment, and to &s;hew the power of his new allies: in this I thought proper to gratify him, though we were &s;even leagues di&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="304"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Wedne&s;. 9.</NOTE>While we were about the&s;e i&s;lands, we expended very little of the &s;hip's provi&s;ions, and were very plentifully &s;up|plied with hogs, fowls, plantains and yams, which we hoped would have been of great u&s;e to us in our cour&s;e to the &s;outhward; but the hogs would not eat European grain of any kind, pul&s;e, or bread-du&s;t, &s;o that we could not pre&s;erve them alive; and the fowls were all very &s;oon &s;eized with a di&s;ea&s;e that affected the head &s;o, that they continued to hold it down between their legs till they died: much dependence therefore mu&s;t not be placed in live &s;tock taken on board at the&s;e places, at lea&s;t not till a di&s;covery is made of &s;ome food that the hogs will eat, and &s;ome remedy for the di&s;ea&s;e of the poultry.</P>
<P>Having been nece&s;&s;arily detained at Ulietea &s;o long, by the carpenters in &s;topping our leak, we determined to give up our de&s;ign of going on &s;hore at Bolabola, e&s;pecially as it ap|peared to be difficult of acce&s;s.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ix i&s;lands, Ulietea, Otaha, Bolabola, Huaheine, Tubai, and Maurua, as they lie contiguous to each other, I gave the names of SOCIETY ISLANDS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Society I&s;lands.</NOTE> but did not think it proper to di&s;tingui&s;h them &s;eparately by any other names than tho&s;e by which they were known to the natives.</P>
<P>They are &s;ituated between the latitude of 16&deg; 10&prime; and 16&deg; 55&prime; S. and between the longitude of 150&deg; 57&prime; and 152&deg; W. from the meridian of Greenwich. Ulietea and Otaha lie within about two miles of each other, and are both inclo&s;ed within one reef of coral rocks, &s;o that there is no pa&s;&s;age for &s;hip|ping between them. This reef forms &s;everal excellent har|bours; the entrances into them, indeed, are but narrow, yet when a &s;hip is once in, nothing can hurt her. The har|bours on the ea&s;t &s;ide have been de&s;cribed already; and on the we&s;t &s;ide of Ulietea, which is the large&s;t of the two, there
<PB N="271" REF="305">
are three. The northermo&s;t, in which we lay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Wedne&s;. 9.</NOTE> is called OHAMANENO: the channel leading into it is about a quarter of a mile wide, and lies between two low &s;andy i&s;lands, which are the northermo&s;t on this &s;ide; between, or ju&s;t within the two i&s;lands, there is good anchorage in twenty-eight fathom, &s;oft ground. This harbour, though &s;mall, is preferable to the others, becau&s;e it is &s;ituated in the mo&s;t fertile part of the i&s;land, and where fre&s;h water is ea&s;ily to be got. The other two harbours lie to the &s;outhward of this, and not far from the &s;outh end of the i&s;land: in both of them there is good anchorage, with ten, twelve, and fourteen fathom. They are ea&s;ily known by three &s;mall woody i&s;lands at their entrance. The &s;outhermo&s;t of the&s;e two harbours lies within, and to the &s;outhward of the &s;outh|ermo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands, and the other, lies between the two northermo&s;t. I was told that there were more harbours at the &s;outh end of this i&s;land, but I did not examine whether the report was true.</P>
<P>Otaha affords two very good harbours, one on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and the other on the we&s;t. That on the ea&s;t &s;ide is called Ohamene, and has been mentioned already; the other is called OHERURUA, and lies about the middle of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land; it is pretty large, and affords good anchorage in twenty and twenty-five fathom, nor is there any want of fre&s;h water. The breach in the reef, that forms a channel into this harbour, is about a quarter of a mile broad, and like all the re&s;t is very &s;leep on both &s;ides; in ge|neral there is no danger here but what is vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Bolabola lies N. W. and by W. from Otaha, di&s;tant about four leagues; it is &s;urrounded by a reef of rocks, and &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, in compa&s;s together about eight leagues. I was told, that on the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of
<PB N="272" REF="306">
the i&s;land there is a channel through the reef into a very good harbour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Wedne&s;. 9.</NOTE> but I did not think it worth while to examine it, for the rea&s;ons that have been ju&s;t a&s;&s;igned. This i&s;land is rendered very remarkable by a high craggy hill, which ap|pears to be almo&s;t perpendicular, and terminates at the top in two peaks, one higher than the other.</P>
<P>The land of Ulietea and Otaha is hilly, broken, and irre|gular, except on the &s;ea coa&s;t, yet the hills look green and plea&s;ant, and are in many places clothed with wood. The &s;everal particulars in which the&s;e i&s;lands and their inhabit|ants differ from what we had ob&s;erved at Otaheite, have been mentioned in the cour&s;e of the narrative.</P>
<P>We pur&s;ued our cour&s;e without any event worthy of note till the 13th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 13.</NOTE> about noon, when we &s;aw land bearing S. E. which Tupia told us was an i&s;land called OHETEROA.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oheteroa.</NOTE> About &s;ix in the evening, we were within two or three leagues of it, upon which I &s;hortened &s;ail, and &s;tood off and on all night:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 14.</NOTE> the next morning &s;tood in for the land. We ran to leeward of the i&s;land, keeping clo&s;e in more, and &s;aw &s;eve|ral of the natives, though in no great numbers, upon the beach. At nine o'clock I &s;ent Mr. Gore, one of my Lieute|nants, in the pinnace, to endeavour to land upon the i&s;land, and learn from the natives whether there was anchorage in a bay then in &s;ight, and what land lay farther to the &s;outh|ward. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander accompanied Mr. Gore in this expedition, and as they thought Tupia might be u&s;eful, they took him with them.</P>
<P>As the boat approached the &s;hore, tho&s;e on board perceived the natives to be armed with long lances; as they did not intend to land till they got round a point which run out at a little di&s;tance, they &s;tood along the coa&s;t, and the natives therefore very probably thought they were afraid of them.
<PB N="273" REF="307">
They had now got together to the number of about &s;ixty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Monday 14.</NOTE> and all of them &s;at down upon the &s;hore, except two, who were di&s;patched forward to ob&s;erve the motions of tho&s;e in the boat. The&s;e men, after walking a-brea&s;t of her &s;ome time, at length leaped into the water, and &s;wam towards her, but were &s;oon left behind; two more then appeared, and at|tempted to board her in the &s;ame manner, but they al&s;o were &s;oon left behind; a fifth man then ran forward alone, and having got a good way a-head of the boat before he took to the water, ea&s;ily reached her. Mr. Banks urged the officer to take him in, thinking it a good opportunity to get the confidence and good-will of a people, who then certainly looked upon them as enemies, but he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed: this man therefore was left behind like the others, and &s;o was a &s;ixth, who followed him.</P>
<P>When the boat had got round the point, &s;he perceived that all her followers had de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit: &s;he now opened a large bay, at the bottom of which appeared another body of men, armed with long lances like the fir&s;t. Here our people prepared to land, and pu&s;hed towards the &s;hore, a canoe at the &s;ame time putting off to meet them. As &s;oon as it came near them, they lay upon their oars, and calling out to them, told them that they were friends, and that if they would come up they would give them nails, which were held up for them to &s;ee: after &s;ome he&s;itation they came up to the boat's &s;tern, and took &s;ome nails that were offered them with great &s;eeming &s;atisfaction; but in le&s;s than a mi|nute they appeared to have formed a de&s;ign of boarding the boat, and making her their prize: three of them &s;uddenly leaped into it, and the others brought up the canoe, which the motion in quitting her had thrown off a little, manife&s;tly with a de&s;ign to follow their a&s;&s;ociates, and &s;upport them in
<PB N="274" REF="308">
their attempt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Monday 14.</NOTE> The fir&s;t that boarded the boat, entered clo&s;e to Mr. Banks, and in&s;tantly &s;natched his powder-horn out of his pocket: Mr. Banks &s;eized it, and with &s;ome difficulty wrenched it out of his hand, at the &s;ame time pre&s;&s;ing again&s;t his brea&s;t in order to force him over-board, but he was too &s;trong for him, and kept his place: the officer then &s;napped his piece, but it mi&s;&s;ed fire, upon which he ordered &s;ome of the people to fire over their heads; two pieces were accord|ingly di&s;charged, upon which they all in&s;tantly leaped into the water: one of the people, either from cowardice or cru|elty, or both, levelled a third piece at one of them as he was &s;wimming away, and the ball grazed his forehead; happily, however, the wound was very &s;light, for he recovered the canoe, and &s;tood up in her as active and vigorous as the re&s;t. The canoe immediately &s;tood in for the &s;hore, where a great number of people, not le&s;s than two hundred, were now a&s;&s;embled. The boat al&s;o pu&s;hed in, but found the land guarded all round with a &s;hoal, upon which the &s;ea broke with a con&s;iderable &s;urf; it was therefore thought advi&s;able by the officer to proceed along &s;hore in &s;earch of a more convenient landing-place: in the mean time the people on board &s;aw the canoe go on &s;hore, and the natives gather ea|gerly round her to enquire the particulars of what had hap|pened. Soon after, a &s;ingle man ran along the &s;hore, armed with his lance, and when he came a-brea&s;t of the boat he began to dance, brandi&s;h his weapon, and call out in a very &s;hrill tone, which Tupia &s;aid was a defiance from the people. The boat continued to row along the &s;hore, and the cham|pion followed it, repeating his defiance by his voice and his ge&s;tures; but no better landing-place being found than that where the canoe had put the natives on &s;hore, the officer turned back with a view to attempt it there, hoping, that if
<PB N="275" REF="309">
it &s;hould not be practicable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Monday 14.</NOTE> the people would come to a con|ference either on the &s;hoals or in their canoes, and that a treaty of peace might be concluded with them.</P>
<P>As the boat rowed &s;lowly along the &s;hore back again, an|other champion came down, &s;houting defiance, and bran|di&s;hing his lance: his appearance was more formidable than that of the other, for he wore a large cap made of the tail feathers of the tropic bird, and his body was covered with &s;tripes of different coloured cloth, yellow, red, and brown. This gentleman al&s;o danced, but with much more nimble|ne&s;s and dexterity than the fir&s;t; our people therefore, con|&s;idering his agility and his dre&s;s, di&s;tingui&s;hed him by the name of HARLEQUIN. Soon after a more grave and elderly man came down to the beach, and hailing the people in the boat, enquired who they were, and from whence they came; Tupia an&s;wered in their own language, from Otaheite: the three natives then walked peaceably along the &s;hore till they came to a &s;hoal, upon which a few people were collected; here they &s;topped, and after a &s;hort conference, they all be|gan to pray very loud: Tupia made his re&s;pon&s;es, but con|tinued to tell us that they were not our friends. When their prayer, or as they call it, their <HI>Poorah,</HI> was over, our people entered into a parley with them, telling them, that if they would lay by their lances and clubs, for &s;ome had one and &s;ome the other, they would come on &s;hore, and trade with them for whatever they would bring: they agreed, but it was only upon condition that we would leave behind us our mu&s;quets: this was a condition which, however equitable it might appear, could not be complied with, nor indeed would it have put the two parties upon an equality, except their numbers had been equal. Here then the negociation &s;eemed to be at an end; but in a little time they ventured to come nearer to the boat, and at la&s;t came near enough to trade,
<PB N="276" REF="310">
which they did very fairly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Monday 14.</NOTE> for a &s;mall quantity of their cloth and &s;ome of their weapons; but as they gave our people no hope of provi&s;ions, nor indeed any thing el&s;e ex|cept they would venture through a narrow channel to the &s;hore, which, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, they did not think it prudent to do, they put off the boat and left them.</P>
<P>With the &s;hip and the boat we had now made the circuit of the i&s;land, and finding that there was neither harbour nor anchorage about it, and that the ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition of the people would render landing impracticable, without blood|&s;hed, I determined not to attempt it, having no motive that could ju&s;tify the ri&s;k of life.</P>
<P>The bay which the boat entered lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, the bottom was foul and rocky, but the water &s;o clear that it could plainly be &s;een at the depth of five and twenty fathom, which is one hundred and fifty feet.</P>
<P>This i&s;land is &s;ituated in the latitude of 22&deg; 27&prime; S, and in the longitude of 150&deg; 47&prime; W. from the meridian of Greenwich. It is thirteen miles in circuit, and rather high than low, but neither populous nor fertile in proportion to the other i&s;lands that we had &s;een in the&s;e &s;eas. The chief produce &s;eems to be the tree of which they make their weapons, called in their language <HI>Etoa</HI>; many plantations of it were &s;een along the &s;hore, which is not &s;urrounded, like the neighbouring i&s;lands, by a reef.</P>
<P>The people &s;eemed to be lu&s;ty and well-made, rather browner than tho&s;e we had left: under their arm-pits they had black marks about as broad as the hand, the edges of which formed not a &s;trait but an indented line; they had al&s;o circles of the &s;ame colour, but not &s;o broad, round their arms and legs, but were not marked on any other part of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="311">Their dre&s;s was very different from any that we had &s;een before, as well as the cloth of which it was made.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Monday 14.</NOTE> The cloth was of the &s;ame materials as that which is worn in the other i&s;lands, and mo&s;t of that which was &s;een by our people was dyed of a bright but deep yellow, and covered on the out&s;ide with a compo&s;ition like varni&s;h, which was either red, or of a dark lead-colour; over this ground it was again painted in &s;tripes of many different patterns, with wonderful regularity, in the manner of our &s;triped &s;ilks in England; the cloth that was painted red was &s;triped with black, and that which was painted lead-colour with white. Their habit was a &s;hort jacket of this cloth, which reached about as low as their knees; it was of one piece, and had no other making than a hole in the middle of it, &s;titched round with long &s;titches, in which it differed from all that we had &s;een before&punc; through this hole the head was put, and what hung down was confined to their bodies by a piece of yellow cloth or &s;a&s;h, which pa&s;&s;ing round the neck behind, was cro&s;&s;ed upon the brea&s;t, and then collected round the wai&s;t like a belt, which pa&s;&s;ed over another belt of red cloth, &s;o that they made a very gay and warlike appearance; &s;ome had caps of the feathers of the tropic bird, which have been be|fore de&s;cribed, and &s;ome had a piece of white or lead-co|loured cloth wound about the head like a &s;mall turban, which our people thought more becoming.</P>
<P>Their arms were long lances, made of the Etoa, the wood of which is very hard; they were well poli&s;hed and &s;harpened at one end: &s;ome were near twenty feet long, though not more than three fingers thick: they had al&s;o a weapon which was both club and pike, made of the &s;ame wood, about &s;even feet long; this al&s;o was well poli&s;hed, and &s;harpened at one end into a broad point. As a guard

again&s;t the&s;e weapons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Monday 14.</NOTE> when they attack each other, they have matts folded up many times, which they place under their clothes from the neck to the wai&s;t: the weapons them|&s;elves indeed are capable of much le&s;s mi&s;chief than tho&s;e of the &s;ame kind which we &s;aw at the other i&s;lands, for the lances were there pointed with the &s;harp bone of the &s;ting-ray that is called the &s;ting, and the pikes were of much greater weight. The other things that we &s;aw here were all &s;uperior in their kind to any we had &s;een before; the cloth was of a better colour in the dye, and painted with greater neat|ne&s;s and ta&s;te; the clubs were better cut and poli&s;hed, and the canoe, though a &s;mall one, was very rich in ornament, and the carving was executed in a better manner: among other decorations peculiar to this canoe, was a line of &s;mall white feathers, which hung from the head and &s;tern on the out&s;ide, and which, when we &s;aw them, were thoroughly wetted by the &s;pray.</P>
<P>Tupia told us, that there were &s;everal i&s;lands lying at dif|ferent di&s;tances and in different directions from this, be|tween the &s;outh and the north we&s;t; and that at the di&s;tance of three days &s;ail to the north ea&s;t, there was an i&s;land called MANUA, bird-i&s;land: he &s;eemed, however, mo&s;t de&s;irous that we &s;hould &s;ail to the we&s;tward, and de&s;cribed &s;everal i&s;lands in that direction which he &s;aid he had vi&s;ited: he told us that he had been ten or twelve days in going thither, and thirty in coming back, and that the <HI>Pahie</HI> in which he had made the voyage, &s;ailed much fa&s;ter than the &s;hip: reckon|ing his Pahie therefore to go at the rate of forty leagues a day, which from my own ob&s;ervation I have great rea&s;on to think the&s;e boats will do, it would make four hundred leagues in ten days, which I compute to be the di&s;tance of Bo&s;cawen and Keppel's I&s;lands, di&s;covered by Captain Wallis,

we&s;tward of Ulietea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. Augu&s;t. Monday 14.</NOTE> and therefore think it very probable that they were the i&s;lands he had vi&s;ited. The farthe&s;t i&s;land that he knew any thing of to the &s;outhward, he &s;aid, lay at the di&s;tance of about two days &s;ail from Oteroah, and was called MOUTOU; but he &s;aid that his father had told him there were i&s;lands to the &s;outhward of that: upon the whole, I was determined to &s;tand &s;outhward in &s;earch of a continent, but to &s;pend no time in &s;earching for i&s;lands, if we did not happen to fall in with them during our cour&s;e.</P>

The next day, it being calm, we hoi&s;ted out the boat, to try whether there was a current, but found none. Our latitude was 37&deg; 10&prime;, longitude 172&deg; 54&prime; W. On the 3d, being in latitude 36&deg; 56&prime;,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 3.</NOTE> longitude 173&deg; 27&prime;, we took up more &s;ea-weed, and another piece of wood covered with barnacles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 4.</NOTE> The next day we &s;aw two more &s;eals, and a brown bird, about as big as a raven, with &s;ome white feathers under the wing. Mr. Gore told us, that birds of this kind were &s;een in great numbers about Falkland's I&s;lands, and our people gave them the name of Port-Egmont hens.</P>
<P>On the 5th, we thought the water changed colour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 5.</NOTE> but upon ca&s;ting the lead, had no ground with 180 fathom. In the evening of this day, the variation was 12&deg; 50&prime; E. and while we were going nine leagues it encrea&s;ed to 14&deg; 2&prime;.</P>
<P>On the next day, Friday, October the 6th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 6.</NOTE> we &s;aw land from the ma&s;t-head, bearing W. by N. and &s;tood directly for it; in the evening it could ju&s;t be di&s;cerned from the deck, and appeared large. The variation this day was, by azimuth and amplitude, 15&deg; 4&prime; &frac12; E. and by ob&s;ervation made of the &s;un and moon, the longitude of the &s;hip appeared to be 180&deg; 55&prime; W. and by the medium of this and &s;ub&s;equent ob|&s;ervations, there appeared to be an error in the &s;hip's account of longitude during her run from Otaheite of 3&deg; 16&prime;, &s;he being &s;o much to the we&s;tward of the longitude re&s;ulting from the log.

<P>On the 7th, it fell calm, we therefore approached the land &s;lowly, and in the afternoon, when a breeze &s;prung up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 7.</NOTE> we were &s;till di&s;tant &s;even or eight leagues. It appeared &s;till larger as it was more di&s;tinctly &s;een, with four or five ranges

of hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Saturday 7.</NOTE> ri&s;ing one over the other, and a chain of mountains above all, which appeared to be of an enormous height. This land became the &s;ubject of much eager conver&s;ation; but the general opinion &s;eemed to be that we had found the <HI>Terra au&s;tralis incognita.</HI> About five o'clock we &s;aw the open|ing of a bay, which &s;eemed to run pretty far inland, upon which we hauled our wind and &s;tood in for it; we al&s;o &s;aw &s;moke a&s;cending from different places on &s;hore. When night came on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 8.</NOTE> however, we kept plying off and on till day-light, when we found our&s;elves to the leeward of the bay, the wind being at north: we could now perceive that the hills were cloathed with wood, and that &s;ome of the trees in the valleys were very large. By noon we fetched in with the &s;outh we&s;t point; but not being able to weather it, tacked and &s;tood off: at this time we &s;aw &s;everal canoes &s;tanding cro&s;s the bay, which in a little time made to &s;hore, without &s;eeming to take the lea&s;t notice of the &s;hip; we al&s;o &s;aw &s;ome hou&s;es, which appeared to be &s;mall, but neat; and near one of them a con&s;iderable number of the people collected to|gether, who were &s;itting upon the beach, and who, we thought, were the &s;ame that we had &s;een in the canoes. Upon a &s;mall penin&s;ula, at the north ea&s;t head, we could plainly perceive a pretty high and regular paling, which inclo&s;ed the whole top of a hill; this was al&s;o the &s;ubject of much &s;pecu|lation, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a park of deer, others an inclo|&s;ure for oxen and &s;heep. About four o'clock in the afternoon, we anchored on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the bay, before the entrance of a &s;mall river, in ten fathom water, with a fine &s;andy bottom, and at about half a league from the &s;hore. The &s;ides of the bay are white cliffs of a great height; the middle is low land, with hills gradually ri&s;ing behind, one towering above another, and terminating in the chain of mountains which appeared to be far inland.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="320">In the evening I went on &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Sunday 8.</NOTE> accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with the pinnace and yawl, and a party of men. We landed abrea&s;t of the &s;hip, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, which was here about forty yards broad; but &s;eeing &s;ome natives on the we&s;t &s;ide whom I wi&s;hed to &s;peak with, and finding the river not fordable, I ordered the yawl in to carry us over, and left the pinnace at the entrance. When we came near the place where the people were a&s;&s;embled, they all ran away; however, we landed, and leaving four boys to take care of the yawl, we walked up to &s;ome huts which were about two or three hundred yards from the water-&s;ide. When we had got &s;ome di&s;tance from the boat, four men, armed with long lances, ru&s;hed out of the woods, and running up to attack the boat, would certainly have cut her off, if the people in the pinnace had not di&s;covered them, and called to the boys to drop down the &s;tream: the boys in&s;tantly obeyed; but being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the Indians, the Cock&s;wain of the pinnace, who had the charge of the boats, fired a mu&s;quet over their heads; at this they &s;topped and looked round them, but in a few minutes renewed the pur&s;uit, brandi&s;hing their lances in a threatening manner: the Cock&s;wain then fired a &s;econd mu&s;quet over their heads, but of this they took no notice; and one of them lifting up his &s;pear to dart it at the boat, another piece was fired, which &s;hot him dead. When he fell, the other three &s;tood motion|le&s;s for &s;ome minutes, as if petrified with a&s;toni&s;hment; as &s;oon as they recovered, they went back, dragging after them the dead body, which however they &s;oon left, that it might not incumber their flight. At the report of the fir&s;t mu&s;quet we drew together, having &s;traggled to a little di&s;tance from each other, and made the be&s;t of our way back to the boat; and cro&s;&s;ing the river, we &s;oon &s;aw the Indian lying dead upon the ground. Upon examining the body, we found
<PB N="286" REF="321">
that he had been &s;hot through the heart:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Sunday 8.</NOTE> he was a man of the middle &s;ize and &s;tature; his complexion was brown, but not very dark; and one &s;ide of his face was tattowed in &s;piral lines of a very regular figure: he was covered with a fine cloth, of a manufacture altogether new to us, and it was tied on exactly according to the repre&s;entation in Valentyn's Account of Abel Ta&s;man's Voyage, vol. iii. part 2. page 50. his hair al&s;o was tied in a knot on the top of his head, but had no feather in it. We returned immediately to the &s;hip, where we could hear the people on &s;hore talking with great earne&s;tne&s;s, and in a very loud tone, probably about what had happened, and what &s;hould be done.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 9.</NOTE>In the morning, we &s;aw &s;everal of the natives where they had been &s;een the night before, and &s;ome walking with a quick pace towards the place where we had landed, mo&s;t of them unarmed; but three or four with long pikes in their hands. As I was de&s;irous to e&s;tabli&s;h an intercour&s;e with them, I ordered three boats to be manned with &s;eamen and marines, and proceeded towards the &s;hore, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, the other Gentlemen, and Tu|pia; about fifty of them &s;eemed to wait for our landing, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river, which we thought a &s;ign of fear, and &s;eated them&s;elves upon the ground: at fir&s;t, there|fore, my&s;elf, with only Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia, landed from the little boat, and advanced towards them; but we had not proceeded many paces before they all &s;tarted up, and every man produced either a long pike, or a &s;mall wea|pon of green Talc, extremely well poli&s;hed, about a foot long, and thick enough to weigh four or five pounds: Tu|pia called to them in the language of Otaheite; but they an&s;wered only by flouri&s;hing their weapons, and making &s;igns to us to depart; a mu&s;quet was then fired wide of them, and the ball &s;truck the water, the river being &s;till between us:

they &s;aw the effect, and de&s;i&s;ted from their threats;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Monday 9.</NOTE> but we thought it prudent to retreat till the marines could be landed. This was &s;oon done; and they marched, with a jack carried before them, to a little bank, about fifty yards from the water-&s;ide; here they were drawn up, and I again advanced, with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander; Tupia, Mr. Green, and Mr. Monkhou&s;e, being with us. Tupia was again directed to &s;peak to them, and it was with great plea&s;ure that we perceived he was perfectly under&s;tood, he and the natives &s;peaking only different dialects of the &s;ame language. He told them that we wanted provi&s;ion and water, and would give them iron in exchange, the properties of which he ex|plained as well as he was able. They were willing to trade, and de&s;ired that we would come over to them for that pur|po&s;e: to this we con&s;ented, provided they would lay by their arms; which, however, they could by no means be per|&s;uaded to do. During this conver&s;ation, Tupia warned us to be upon our guard, for that they were not our friends: we then pre&s;&s;ed them in our turn to come over to us; and at la&s;t one of them &s;tripped him&s;elf, and &s;wam over without his arms: he was almo&s;t immediately followed by two more, and &s;oon after by mo&s;t of the re&s;t, to the number of twenty or thirty; but the&s;e brought their arms with them. We made them all pre&s;ents of iron and beads; but they &s;eemed to &s;et little value upon either, particularly the iron, not hav|ing the lea&s;t idea of its u&s;e; &s;o that we got nothing in return but a few feathers: they offered indeed to exchange their arms for ours, and, when we refu&s;ed, made many attempts to &s;natch them out of our hands. As &s;oon as they came over, Tupia repeated his declaration, that they were not our friends, and again warned us to be upon our guard; their attempts to &s;natch our weapons, therefore, did not &s;ucceed; and we gave them to under&s;tand by Tupia, that we &s;hould
<PB N="288" REF="323">
be obliged to kill them if they offered any farther violence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Monday 9.</NOTE> In a few minutes, however, Mr. Green happening to turn about, one of them &s;natched away his hanger, and retiring to a little di&s;tance, waved it round his head, with a &s;hout of exultation: the re&s;t now began to be extremely in&s;olent, and we &s;aw more coming to join them from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river. It was therefore become nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;s them, and Mr. Banks fired at the man who had taken the hanger with &s;mall &s;hot, at the di&s;tance of about fifteen yards: when the &s;hot &s;truck him, he cea&s;ed his cry; but in&s;tead of return|ing the hanger, continued to flouri&s;h it over his head, at the &s;ame time &s;lowly retreating to a greater di&s;tance. Mr. Monk|hou&s;e &s;eeing this, fired at him with ball, and he in&s;tantly dropped. Upon this the main body, who had retired to a rock in the middle of the river upon the fir&s;t di&s;charge, be|gan to return; two that were near to the man who had been killed, ran up to the body, one feized his weapon of green Tale, and the other endeavoured to &s;ecure the hanger, which Mr. Monkhou&s;e had but ju&s;t time to prevent. As all that had retired to the rock were now advancing, three of us di&s;|charged our pieces, loaded only with &s;mall &s;hot, upon which they &s;wam back for the &s;hore; and we perceived, upon their landing, that two or three of them were wounded. They retired &s;lowly up the country, and we reimbarked in our boats.</P>
<P>As we had unhappily experienced that nothing was to be done with the&s;e people at this place, and finding the water in the river to be &s;alt, I proceeded in the boats round the head of the bay in &s;earch of fre&s;h water, and with a de&s;ign, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome of the natives, and take them on board, where by kind treatment and pre&s;ents I might obtain their friend&s;hip, and by their means e&s;tabli&s;h an amicable corre&s;pondence with their countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="324">To my great regret, I found no place where I could land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Monday 9.</NOTE> a dangerous &s;urf every where beating upon the &s;hore; but I &s;aw two canoes coming in from the &s;ea, one under &s;ail, and the other worked with paddles. I thought this a favourable opportunity to get &s;ome of the people into my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion without mi&s;chief, as tho&s;e in the canoe were probably fi&s;her|men and without arms, and I had three boats full of men. I therefore di&s;po&s;ed the boats &s;o as mo&s;t effectually to inter|cept them in their way to the &s;hore; the people in the canoe that was paddled perceived us &s;o &s;oon, that by making to the neare&s;t land with their utmo&s;t &s;trength, they e&s;caped us; the other &s;ailed on till &s;he was in the mid&s;t of us, without di&s;cerning what we were; but the moment &s;he di&s;covered us, the people on board &s;truck their &s;ail, and took to their paddles, which they plied &s;o bri&s;kly that &s;he out-ran the boat. They were however within hearing, and Tupia called out to them to come along &s;ide, and promi&s;ed for us that they &s;hould come to no hurt: they cho&s;e, however, rather to tru&s;t to their paddles than our promi&s;es, and continued to make from us with all their power. I then ordered a mu&s;quet to be fired over their heads, as the lea&s;t exceptionable expedient to accompli&s;h my de&s;ign, hoping it would either make them &s;urrender or leap into the water. Upon the di&s;charge of the piece, they cea&s;ed paddling; and all of them, being &s;even in number, began to &s;trip, as we imagined to jump over|board; but it happened otherwi&s;e. They immediately formed a re&s;olution not to fly, but to fight; and when the boat came up, they began the attack with their paddles, and with &s;tones and other offen&s;ive weapons that were in the boat, &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that we were obliged to fire upon them in our own defence: four were unhappily killed, and the other three who were boys, the elde&s;t about nineteen, and the younge&s;t about eleven, in&s;tantly leaped into the water;
<PB N="290" REF="325">
the elde&s;t &s;wam with great vigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Monday 9.</NOTE> and re&s;i&s;ted the attempts of our people to take him into the boat by every effort that he could make: he was however at la&s;t overpowered, and the other two were taken up with le&s;s difficulty. I am con|&s;cious that the feeling of every reader of humanity will cen|&s;ure me for having fired upon the&s;e unhappy people, and it is impo&s;&s;ible that, upon a calm review, I &s;hould approve it my&s;elf. They certainly did not de&s;erve death for not chu&s;ing to confide in my promi&s;es; or not con&s;enting to come on board my boat, even if they had apprehended no danger; but the nature of my &s;ervice required me to obtain a know|lege of their country, which I could no otherwi&s;e effect than by forcing my way into it in a ho&s;tile manner, or gaining admi&s;&s;ion through the confidence and good-will of the people. I had already tried the power of pre&s;ents without effect; and I was now prompted, by my de&s;ire to avoid further ho&s;tili|ties, to get &s;ome of them on board, as the only method left of convincing them that we intended them no harm, and had it in our power to contribute to their gratification and convenience. Thus far my intentions certainly were not cri|minal; and though in the conte&s;t, which I had not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to expect, our victory might have been complete with|out &s;o great an expence of life; yet in &s;uch &s;ituations, when the command to fire has been given, no man can re&s;train its exce&s;s, or pre&s;cribe its effect.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the poor wretches whom we had taken out of the water were in the boat, they &s;quatted down, expecting no doubt in&s;tantly to be put to death: we made ha&s;te to con|vince them of the contrary, by every method in our power; we furni&s;hed them with clothes, and gave them every other te&s;timony of kindne&s;s that could remove their fears and en|gage their good-will. Tho&s;e who are acquainted with hu|man nature will not wonder, that the &s;udden joy of the&s;e

young &s;avages at being unexpectedly delivered from the fear of death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Monday 9.</NOTE> and kindly treated by tho&s;e whom they &s;uppo&s;ed would have been their in&s;tant executioners, &s;urmounted their concern for the friends they had lo&s;t, and was &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed in their countenances and behaviour. Before we reached the &s;hip, their &s;u&s;picions and fears being wholly removed, they appeared to be not only reconciled to their &s;ituation but in high &s;pirits, and upon being offered &s;ome bread when they came on board, they devoured it with a voracious appetite. They an&s;wered and a&s;ked many que&s;|tions, with great appearance of plea&s;ure and curio&s;ity; and when our dinner came, they expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to ta&s;te every thing that they &s;aw: they &s;eemed be&s;t plea&s;ed with the &s;alt pork, though we had other provi&s;ions upon the table. At &s;un-&s;et, they eat another meal with great eagerne&s;s, each devouring a large quantity of bread, and drinking above a quart of water. We then made them beds upon the lockers, and they went to &s;leep with great &s;eeming content. In the night, however, the tumult of their minds having &s;ub&s;ided, and given way to reflection, they &s;ighed often and loud. Tu|pia, who was always upon the watch to comfort them, got up, and by &s;oothing and encouragement made them not only ea&s;y but cheerful; their cheerfulne&s;s was encouraged &s;o that they &s;ung a &s;ong with a degree of ta&s;te that &s;urpri&s;ed us: the tune was &s;olemn and &s;low, like tho&s;e of our P&s;alms, containing many notes and &s;emitones. Their countenances were intelligent and expre&s;&s;ive, and the middlemo&s;t, who &s;eemed to be about fifteen, had an openne&s;s in his a&s;pect, and an ea&s;e in his deportment which were very &s;triking: we found that the two elde&s;t were brothers, and that their names were TAAHOURANGE and KOIKERANGE; the name of the younge&s;t was MARAGOVETE. As we were returning to the &s;hip, after having taken the&s;e boys into the boat, we
<PB N="292" REF="327">
picked up a large piece of pummice &s;tone floating upon the water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October.</NOTE> a &s;ure &s;ign that there either is, or has been a volcano in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 10.</NOTE>In the morning, they all &s;eemed to be cheerful, and eat another enormous meal; after this we dre&s;&s;ed them, and adorned them with bracelets, anclets, and necklaces, after their own fa&s;hion, and the boat being hoi&s;ted out, they were told that we were going to &s;et them a&s;hore: this produced a tran&s;port of joy; but upon perceiving that we made towards our fir&s;t landing-place near the river, their countenances changed, and they entreated with great earne&s;tne&s;s that they might not be &s;et a&s;hore at that place, becau&s;e they &s;aid, it was inhabited by their enemies, who would kill them and eat them. This was a great di&s;appointment to me; becau&s;e I hoped the report and appearance of the boys would procure a favourable reception for our&s;elves. I had already &s;ent an officer on &s;hore with the marines and a party of men to cut wood, and I was determined to land near the place; not however to abandon the boys, if, when we got a&s;hore, they &s;hould be unwilling to leave us; but to &s;end a boat with them in the evening to that part of the bay to which they pointed, and which they called their home. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander and Tupia were with me, and upon our landing with the boys, and cro&s;&s;ing the river, they &s;eemed at fir&s;t to be unwilling to leave us; but at length they &s;uddenly changed their mind, and, though not without a manife&s;t &s;truggle, and &s;ome tears, they took their leave: when they were gone, we proceeded along a &s;wamp, with a de&s;ign to &s;hoot &s;ome ducks, of which we &s;aw great plenty, and four of the marines attended us, walking abrea&s;t of us upon a bank that overlooked the country. After we had advanced about a mile, the&s;e men called out to us and told us, that a large body of the Indians was in &s;ight, and advancing at a
<PB N="293" REF="328">
great rate. Upon receiving this intelligence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Tue&s;day 10.</NOTE> we drew to|gether, and re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of our way to the boats; we had &s;carcely begun to put this into execution, when the three Indian boys &s;tarted &s;uddenly from &s;ome bu&s;hes, where they had concealed them&s;elves, and again claimed our protection: we readily received them, and re|pairing to the beach as the cleare&s;t place, we walked bri&s;kly towards the boats. The Indians were in two bodies; one ran along the bank which had been quitted by the marines, the other fetched a compa&s;s by the &s;wamp &s;o that we could not &s;ee them: when they perceived that we had formed into one body, they &s;lackened their pace; but &s;till followed us in a gentle walk: that they &s;lackened their pace, was for us, as well as for them, a fortunate circum&s;tance; for when we came to the &s;ide of the river, where we expected to find the boats that were to carry us over to the wooders, we found the pinnace at lea&s;t a mile from her &s;tation, having been &s;ent to pick up a bird which had been &s;hot by the officer on &s;hore, and the little boat was obliged to make three trips before we could all get over to the re&s;t of the party. As &s;oon as we were drawn up on the other &s;ide, the Indians came down, not in a body as we ex|pected, but by two or three at a time, all armed, and in a &s;hort time their number increa&s;ed to about two hundred: as we now de&s;paired of making peace with them, &s;eeing that the dread of our &s;mall arms did not keep them at a di&s;tance, and that the &s;hip was too far off to reach the place with a &s;hot, we re&s;olved to re-imbark, le&s;t our &s;tay &s;hould imbroil us in another quarrel, and co&s;t more of the Indians their lives. We therefore advanced towards the pinnace which was now returning, when one of the boys &s;uddenly cried out, that his uncle was among the people who had marched down to us, and de&s;ired us to &s;tay and talk with them: we complied, and a parley immediately commenced between

them and Tupia;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Tue&s;day 10.</NOTE> during which the boys held up every thing we had given them as tokens of our kindne&s;s and li|berality; but neither would either of the boys &s;wim over to them, or any of them to the boys. The body of the man who had been killed the day before, &s;till lay expo&s;ed upon the beach; the boys &s;eeing it lie very near us, went up to it, and covered it with &s;ome of the clothes that we had given them; and &s;oon after a &s;ingle man, unarmed, who proved to be the uncle of Maragovete, the younge&s;t of the boys, &s;wam over to us, bringing in his hand a green branch, which we &s;uppo&s;ed, as well here as at Otaheite, to be an emblem of peace. We received his branch by the hands of Tupia, to whom he gave it, and made him many pre&s;ents; we al&s;o invited him to go on board the &s;hip, but he declined it; we therefore left him, and expected that his nephew, and the two other young Indians would have &s;taid with him, but to our great &s;urprize, they cho&s;e rather to go with us. As &s;oon as we had retired, he went and gathered another green branch, and with this in his hand, he approached the dead body which the youth had covered with part of his clothes&punc; walking &s;ideways, with many ceremonies, and then throw|ing it towards him. When this was done, he returned to his companions, who had &s;at down upon the &s;and to ob&s;erve the i&s;&s;ue of his negotiation: they immediately gathered round him, and continued in a body above an hour, without &s;eeming to take any farther notice of us. We were more curious than they, and ob&s;erving them with our gla&s;&s;es from on board the &s;hip, we &s;aw &s;ome of them cro&s;s the river upon a kind of raft, or catamarine, and four of them carry off the dead body which had been covered by the boy, and over which his uncle had performed the ceremony of the branch, upon a kind of bier, between four men: the other body was &s;till &s;uffered to remain where it had been fir&s;t left.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="330">After dinner, I directed Tupia to a&s;k the boys,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Tue&s;day 10.</NOTE> if they had now any objection to going a&s;hore, where we had left their uncle, the body having been carried off, which we under|&s;tood was a ratification of peace: they &s;aid, they had not; and the boat being ordered, they went into it with great alacrity: when the boat, in which I had &s;ent two mid&s;hipmen, came to land, they went willingly a&s;hore; but &s;oon after &s;he put off, they returned to the rocks, and wading into the water, earne&s;tly entreated to be taken on board again; but the people in the boat, having po&s;itive orders to leave them, could not comply. We were very attentive to what happened on &s;hore, and keeping a con&s;tant watch with our gla&s;&s;es, we &s;aw a man pa&s;s the river upon another raft, and fetch them to a place where forty or fifty of the natives were a&s;&s;embled, who clo&s;ed round them, and continued in the &s;ame place till &s;un|&s;et: upon looking again, when we &s;aw them in motion, we could plainly di&s;tingui&s;h our three pri&s;oners, who &s;eparated them&s;elves from the re&s;t, came down to the beach, and hav|ing waved their hands three times towards the &s;hip, ran nimbly back and joined their companions, who walked lei|&s;urely away towards that part which the boys had pointed to as their dwelling-place; we had therefore the greate&s;t rea&s;on to believe that no mi&s;chief would happen to them, e&s;pecially as we perceived that they went off in the clothes we had given them.</P>
<P>After it was dark, loud voices were heard on &s;hore in the bottom of the bay as u&s;ual, of which we could never learn the meaning.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Wedne&s;. 11.</NOTE>THE next morning, at &s;ix o'clock, we weighed, and &s;tood away from this unfortunate and inho&s;pitable place, to which I gave the name of POVERTY BAY, and which by the natives is called TAONEROA or Long Sand, as it did not af|ford us a &s;ingle article that we wanted except a little wood. It lies in latitude 38&deg; 42&prime; S. and longitude 181&deg; 36&prime; W.; it is in the form of an hor&s;e-&s;hoe, and is known by an i&s;land lying clo&s;e under the north ea&s;t point: the two points which form the entrance are high, with &s;teep white cliffs, and lie a league and a half or two leagues from each other, N.E. by E. and S. W. by W.: the depth of water in the bay is from twelve to five fathom, with a &s;andy bottom and good an|chorage; but the &s;ituation is open to the wind between the &s;outh and ea&s;t: boats can go in and out of the river at any time of the tide in fine weather; but as there is a bar at the entrance, no boat can go either in or out when the &s;ea runs high: the be&s;t place to attempt it, is on the north ea&s;t &s;ide, and it is there practicable when it is not &s;o in any other part. The &s;hore of the bay, a little within its entrance, is a low flat &s;and; behind which, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, the face of the country is finely diver&s;ified by hills and valleys, all clothed
<PB N="297" REF="332">
with wood, and covered with verdure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Wedne&s;. 11.</NOTE> The country al&s;o appears to be well inhabited, e&s;pecially in the valleys leading up from the bay, where we daily &s;aw &s;moke ri&s;ing in clouds one behind another to a great di&s;tance, till the view ter|minated in mountains of a &s;tupendous height.</P>
<P>The &s;outh we&s;t point of the bay I named YOUNG NICK's HEAD, after Nicholas Young, the boy who fir&s;t &s;aw the land; at noon, it bore N. W. by W. di&s;tant about three or four leagues, and we were then about three miles from the &s;hore. The main land extended from N. E. by N. to &s;outh, and I propo&s;ed to follow the direction of the coa&s;t to the &s;outh|ward as far as the latitude of 40 or 41; and then, if I met with no encouragement to proceed farther, to return to the northward.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we lay becalmed, which the people on &s;hore perceiving, &s;everal canoes put off, and came within le&s;s than a quarter of a mile of the ve&s;&s;el; but could not be per&s;uaded to come nearer, though Tupia exerted all the powers of his lungs and his eloquence upon the occa&s;ion, &s;houting, and promi&s;ing that they &s;hould not be hurt. Ano|ther canoe was now &s;een coming from Poverty Bay, with only four people on board, one of whom we well remem|bered to have &s;een in our fir&s;t interview upon the rock. This canoe, without &s;topping or taking the lea&s;t notice of the others, came directly along&s;ide of the &s;hip, and with very little per&s;ua&s;ion, we got the Indians on board. Their example was &s;oon followed by the re&s;t, and we had about us &s;even canoes, and about fifty men. We made them all pre&s;ents with a liberal hand; notwith&s;tanding which, they were &s;o de&s;irous to have more of our commodities, that they &s;old us every thing they had, even the clothes from their backs, and the paddles from their boats. There were but two weapons
<PB N="298" REF="333">
among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Wedne&s;. 11.</NOTE> the&s;e were the in&s;truments of green talc, which were &s;haped &s;omewhat like a pointed battledore, with a &s;hort handle and &s;harp edges; they were called <HI>Patoo-Patoo,</HI> and were well contrived for clo&s;e-fighting, as they would cer|tainly &s;plit the thicke&s;t &s;cull at a &s;ingle blow.</P>
<P>When the&s;e people had recovered from the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of fear, which notwith&s;tanding their re&s;olution in coming on board, had manife&s;tly thrown them into &s;ome confu&s;ion, we enquired after our poor boys. The man who fir&s;t came on board immediately an&s;wered, that they were unhurt and at home; adding, that he had been induced to venture on board by the account which they had given him of the kindne&s;s with which they had been treated, and the wonders that were contained in the &s;hip.</P>
<P>While they were on board they &s;hewed every &s;ign of friend|&s;hip, and invited us very cordially to go back to our old bay, or to a &s;mall cove which they pointed out, that was not quite &s;o far off; but I cho&s;e rather to pro&s;ecute my di&s;coveries than go back, having rea&s;on to hope that I &s;hould find a better harbour than any I had yet &s;een.</P>
<P>About an hour before &s;un-&s;et, the canoes put off from the &s;hip with the few paddles they had re&s;erved, which were &s;carcely &s;ufficient to &s;et them on &s;hore; but by &s;ome means or other three of their people were left behind: as &s;oon as we di&s;covered it, we hailed them; but not one of them would return to take them on board: this greatly &s;urpri&s;ed us; but we were &s;urpri&s;ed &s;till more to ob&s;erve that the de&s;erted In|dians did not &s;eem at all unea&s;y at their &s;ituation, but enter|tained us with dancing and &s;inging after their manner, eat their &s;uppers, and went quietly to bed.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="334">A light breeze &s;pringing up &s;oon after it was dark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Wedne&s;. 11.</NOTE> we &s;teered along the &s;hore under an ea&s;y &s;ail till midnight, and then brought to, &s;oon after which it fell calm; we were now &s;ome leagues di&s;tant from the place where the canoes had left us, and at day-break, when the Indians perceived it, they were &s;eized with con&s;ternation and terror, and lamented their &s;ituation in loud complaints, with ge&s;tures of de&s;pair and many tears. Tupia, with great difficulty, pacified them; and about &s;even o'clock in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 12.</NOTE> a light breeze &s;pringing up, we continued to &s;tand &s;outh we&s;t along the &s;hore. Fortunately for our poor Indians, two canoes came off about this time, and made towards the &s;hip: they &s;topped, however, at a little di&s;tance, and &s;eemed unwilling to tru&s;t them&s;elves nearer. Our Indians were greatly agitated in this &s;tate of uncertainty, and urged their fellows to come along&s;ide of the &s;hip, both by their voice and ge&s;tures, with the utmo&s;t eagerne&s;s and impatience. Tupia interpreted what they &s;aid, and we were much &s;urpri&s;ed to find, that, among other arguments, they a&s;&s;ured the people in the ca|noes, we did not eat men. We now began &s;eriou&s;ly to be|lieve that this horrid cu&s;tom prevailed among them; for what the boys had &s;aid, we con&s;idered as a mere hyperboli|cal expre&s;&s;ion of their fear. One of the canoes, at length, ventured to come under the &s;hip's &s;ide; and an old man came on board, who &s;eemed to be a Chief from the finery of his garment, and the &s;uperiority of his weapon, which was a Patoo-Patoo, made of bone, that, as he &s;aid, had belonged to a whale. He &s;taid on board but a &s;hort time, and when he went away, he took with him our gue&s;ts, very much to the &s;atisfaction both of them and us.</P>
<P>At the time when we &s;ailed, we were abrea&s;t of a point, from which the land trends S. S. W. and which, on account
<PB N="300" REF="335">
of its figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Thur&s;day 12.</NOTE> I called CAPE TABLE. This point lies &s;even leagues to the &s;outhward of Poverty Bay, in latitude 39&deg; 7&prime; S. and longitude 181&deg; 36&prime; W.: it is of a con&s;iderable height, makes in a &s;harp angle, and appears to be quite flat at the top.</P>
<P>In &s;teering along the &s;hore to the &s;outhward of the Cape, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles, our &s;oundings were from twenty to thirty fathom, having a chain of rocks be|tween us and the &s;hore, which appeared at different heights above the water.</P>
<P>At noon, Cape Table bore N. 20 E. di&s;tant about four leagues, and a &s;mall i&s;land, which was the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight, bore S. 70 W. at the di&s;tance of about three miles. This i&s;land, which the natives call TEAHOWRAY, I named the ISLAND OF PORTLAND,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;land of Portland.</NOTE> from its very great re&s;emblance to Portland in the Engli&s;h Channel: it lies about a mile from a point on the main; but there appears to be a ridge of rocks, extending nearly, if not quite, from one to the other. N. 57 E. two miles from the &s;outh point of Portland, lies a &s;unken rock, upon which the &s;ea breaks with great violence. We pa&s;&s;ed between this rock and the land, having from &s;eventeen to twenty fathom.</P>
<P>In &s;ailing along the &s;hore, we &s;aw the natives a&s;&s;embled in great numbers as well upon Portland I&s;land as the main: we could al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h &s;everal &s;pots of ground that were cultivated; &s;ome &s;eemed to be fre&s;h turned up, and lay in furrows like ploughed land, and &s;ome had plants upon them in different &s;tages of their growth. We &s;aw al&s;o in two places, high rails upon the ridges of hills, like what we had &s;een upon the penin&s;ula at the north ea&s;t head of Poverty bay: as they were ranged in lines only, and not &s;o as to en|clo&s;e
<PB N="301" REF="336">
an area, we could not gue&s;s at their u&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Thur&s;day 12.</NOTE> and therefore &s;uppo&s;ed they might be the work of &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>About noon another canoe appeared, in which were four men; &s;he came within about a quarter of a mile of us, where the people on board &s;eemed to perform divers ceremonies: one of them, who was in the bow, &s;ometimes &s;eemed to a&s;k and to offer peace, and &s;ometimes to threaten war, by bran|di&s;hing a weapon that he held in his hand: &s;ometimes al&s;o he danced, and &s;ometimes he &s;ung. Tupia talked much to him, but could not per&s;uade him to come to the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Between one and two o'clock we di&s;covered land to the we&s;tward of Portland, extending to the &s;outhward as far as we could &s;ee; and as the &s;hip was hauling round the &s;outh end of the i&s;land, &s;he &s;uddenly fell into &s;hoal water and broken ground: we had indeed always &s;even fathom or more, but the &s;oundings were never twice the &s;ame, jump|ing at once from &s;even fathom to eleven; in a &s;hort time, however, we got clear of all danger, and had again deep water under us.</P>
<P>At this time the i&s;land lay within a mile of us, making in white cliffs, and a long &s;pit of low land running from it to|wards the main. On the &s;ides of the&s;e cliffs &s;at va&s;t numbers of people, looking at us with a fixed attention, and it is pro|bable that they perceived &s;ome appearance of hurry and confu&s;ion on board, and &s;ome irregularity in the working of the &s;hip, while we were getting clear of the &s;hallow water and broken ground, from which they might infer that we were alarmed or in di&s;tre&s;s; we thought that they wi&s;hed to take advantage of our &s;ituation, for five canoes were put off with the utmo&s;t expedition, full of men, and well armed: they came &s;o near, and &s;hewed &s;o ho&s;tile a di&s;po&s;ition by &s;houting, brandi&s;hing their lances, and u&s;ing threatening
<PB N="302" REF="337">
ge&s;tures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Thur&s;day 12.</NOTE> that we were in &s;ome pain for our &s;mall boat, which was &s;till employed in &s;ounding: a mu&s;ket was there|fore fired over them, but finding it did them no harm, they &s;eemed rather to be provoked than intimidated, and I there|fore fired a four pounder, charged with grape-&s;hot, wide of them: this had a better effect; upon the report of the piece they all ro&s;e up and &s;houted, but in&s;tead of continuing the chace, drew altogether, and after a &s;hort con&s;ultation, went quietly away.</P>
<P>Having got round Portland, we hauled in for the land N. W. having a gentle breeze at N. E. which about five o'clock died away, and obliged us to anchor; we had one and twenty fathom, with a fine &s;andy bottom: the &s;outh point of Port|land bore S. E. &frac12; S. di&s;tant about two leagues, and a low point on the main bore N. &frac12; E.: in the &s;ame direction with this low point, there runs a deep bay, behind the land of which Cape Table is the extremity, &s;o as to make this land a penin&s;ula, leaving only a low narrow neck between that and the main. Of this penin&s;ula, which the natives call TERAKACO, Cape Table is the north point, and Portland the &s;outh.</P>
<P>While we lay at anchor, two more canoes came off to us, one armed, and the other a &s;mall fi&s;hing-boat, with only four men in her; they came &s;o near that they entered into conver&s;ation with Tupia; they an&s;wered all the que&s;tions that he a&s;ked them with great civility, but could not be per|&s;uaded to come on board; they came near enough, how|ever, to receive &s;everal pre&s;ents that were thrown to them from the &s;hip, with which they &s;eemed much plea&s;ed, and went away. During the night many fires were kept upon &s;hore, probably to &s;hew us that the inhabitants were too much upon their guard to be &s;urprized.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="338">About five o'clock in the morning of the 13th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Friday 13.</NOTE> a breeze &s;pringing up northerly, we weighed, and &s;teered in for the land. The &s;hore here forms a large bay, of which Portland is the north ea&s;t point, and the bay that runs behind Cape Table an arm. This arm I had a great inclination to ex|amine, becau&s;e there appeared to be &s;afe anchorage in it, but not being &s;ure of that, and the wind being right an end, I was unwilling to &s;pare the time. Four and twenty fathom was the greate&s;t depth within Portland, but the ground was every where clear. The land near the &s;hore is of a moderate height, with white cliffs and &s;andy beaches; within, it ri&s;es into mountains, and upon the whole the &s;urface is hilly, for the mo&s;t part covered with wood, and to appearance plea&s;ant and fertile. In the morning nine canoes came after the &s;hip, but whether with peaceable or ho&s;tile intentions we could not tell, for we &s;oon left them behind us.</P>
<P>In the evening we &s;tood in for a place that had the appear|ance of an opening, but found no harbour; we therefore &s;tood out again, and were &s;oon followed by a large canoe, with eighteen or twenty men, all armed, who, though they could not reach us, &s;houted defiance, and brandi&s;hed their weapons, with many ge&s;tures of menace and in&s;ult.</P>
<P>In the morning we had a view of the mountains inland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 14.</NOTE> upon which the &s;now was &s;till lying: the country near the &s;hore was low and unfit for culture, but in one place we per|ceived a patch of &s;omewhat yellow, which had greatly the appearance of a corn field, yet was probably nothing more than &s;ome dead flaggs, which are not uncommon in &s;wampy places: at &s;ome di&s;tance we &s;aw groves of trees, which ap|peared high and tapering, and being not above two leagues from the &s;outh well cod of the great bay, in which we had been coa&s;ting for the two la&s;t days, I hoi&s;ted out the pinnace
<PB N="304" REF="339">
and long-boat to &s;earch for fre&s;h water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Saturday 14.</NOTE> but ju&s;t as they were about to put off, we &s;aw &s;everal boats full of people coming from the &s;hore, and therefore I did not think it &s;afe for them to leave the &s;hip. About ten o'clock, five of the&s;e boats having drawn together, as if to hold a con&s;ultation, made towards the &s;hip, having on board between eighty and ninety men, and four more followed at &s;ome di&s;tance, as if to &s;u&s;tain the attack: when the fir&s;t five came within about a hundred yards of the &s;hip, they began to &s;ing their war &s;ong, and brandi&s;hing their pikes, prepared for an engage|ment. We had now no time to lo&s;e, for if we could not pre|vent the attack, we &s;hould come under the unhappy nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing our fire-arms again&s;t them, which we were very de|&s;irous to avoid. Tupia was therefore ordered to acquaint them that we had weapons which, like thunder, would de&s;troy them in a moment; that we would immediately con|vince them of their power by directing their effect &s;o that they &s;hould not be hurt; but that if they per&s;i&s;ted in any ho&s;tile attempt, we &s;hould be obliged to u&s;e them for our defence: a four pounder, loaded with grape-&s;hot, was then di&s;charged wide of them, which produced the de&s;ired effect; the report, the fla&s;h, and above all, the &s;hot, which &s;pread very far in the water, &s;o intimidated them, that they began to paddle away with all their might: Tupia, however, call|ing after them, and a&s;&s;uring them that if they would come unarmed, they &s;hould be kindly received; the people in one of the boats put their arms on board of another, and came under the &s;hip's &s;tern; we made them &s;everal pre&s;ents, and &s;hould certainly have prevailed upon them to come on board, if the other canoes had not come up, and again threatened us, by &s;houting and brandi&s;hing their weapons: at this the people who had come to the &s;hip unarmed, expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;oon after they all went away.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="340">In the afternoon we &s;tood over to the &s;outh point of the bay, but not reaching it before it was dark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Sunday 15.</NOTE> we &s;tood off and on all night. At eight the next morning, being a-brea&s;t of the point, &s;everal fi&s;hing boats came off to us, and &s;old us &s;ome &s;tinking fi&s;h: it was the be&s;t they had, and we were willing to trade with them upon any terms: the&s;e people behaved very well, and we &s;hould have parted good friends if it had not been for a large canoe, with two and twenty armed men on board, which came boldly up along &s;ide of the &s;hip. We &s;oon &s;aw that this boat had nothing for traf|fick, yet we gave them two or three pieces of cloth, an article which they &s;eemed very fond of. I ob&s;erved that one man had a black &s;kin thrown over him, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of a bear, and being de&s;irous to know what animal was its fir&s;t owner, I offered him for it a piece of red baize, and he &s;eemed greatly plea&s;ed with the bargain, imme|diately pulling off the &s;kin, and holding it up in the boat; he would not, however, part with it till he had the cloth in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and as there could be no transfer of property, if with equal caution I had in&s;i&s;ted upon the &s;ame condi|tion, I ordered the cloth to be handed down to him, upon which, with amazing coolne&s;s, in&s;tead of &s;ending up the &s;kin, he began to pack up both that and the baize, which he had received as the purcha&s;e of it, in a ba&s;ket, without pay|ing the lea&s;t regard to my demand or remon&s;trances, and &s;oon after, with the fi&s;hing boats, put off from the &s;hip; when they were at &s;ome di&s;tance, they drew together, and after a &s;hort con&s;ultation returned; the fi&s;hermen offered more fi&s;h, which, though good for nothing, was purcha&s;ed, and trade was again renewed. Among others who were placed over the &s;hip's &s;ide to hand up what we bought, was little Tayeto, Tupia's boy; and one of the Indians, watching his opportunity, &s;uddenly &s;eized him, and dragged him
<PB N="306" REF="341">
down into the canoe;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Sunday 15.</NOTE> two of them held him down in the fore part of it, and the others, with great activity, paddled her off, the re&s;t of the canoes following as fa&s;t as they could: upon this the marines, who were under arms upon deck, were ordered to fire. The &s;hot was directed to that part of the canoe which was farthe&s;t from the boy, and rather wide of her, being willing rather to mi&s;s the rowers than to hurt him: it happened, however, that one man dropped, upon which the others quitted their hold of the boy, who in&s;tantly leaped into the water, and &s;wam towards the &s;hip; the large canoe immediately pulled round and followed him, but &s;ome mu&s;quets, and a great gun being fired at her, &s;he de|&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit. The &s;hip being brought to, a boat was lowered, and the poor boy taken up unhurt, though &s;o terrified that for a time he &s;eemed to be deprived of his &s;en&s;es. Some of the gentlemen who traced the canoes to &s;hore with their gla&s;&s;es, &s;aid, that they &s;aw three men carried up the beach, who appeared to be either dead or wholly di&s;abled by their wounds.</P>
<P>To the cape off which this unhappy tran&s;action happened, I gave the name of CAPE KIDNAPPERS. It lies in latitude 39&deg; 43&prime;, and longitude 182&deg; 24&prime; W. and is rendered remarkable by two white rocks like hay &s;tacks, and the high white cliffs on each &s;ide. It lies S. W. by W. di&s;tant thirteen leagues from the i&s;le of Portland; and between them is the bay of which it is the &s;outh point, and which, in honour of Sir Edward Hawke, then Fir&s;t Lord of the Admiralty, I called HAWKE's BAY.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hawke's Bay.</NOTE> We found in it from twenty-four to &s;even fathom, and good anchorage. From Cape Kidnappers the land trends S. S. W. and in this direction we made our run along the &s;hore, keeping at about a league di&s;tance, with a &s;teady breeze and clear weather.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="342">As &s;oon as Tayeto recovered from his fright,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Sunday 15.</NOTE> he brought a fi&s;h to Tupia, and told him, that he intended it as an offering to his Eatua, or god, in gratitude for his e&s;cape; Tupia com|mended his piety, and ordered him to throw the fi&s;h into the &s;ea, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>About two o'clock in the afternoon, we pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall but high white i&s;land, lying clo&s;e to the &s;hore, upon which we &s;aw many hou&s;es, boats, and people. The people we con|cluded to be fi&s;hers, becau&s;e the i&s;land was totally barren; we &s;aw &s;everal people al&s;o on &s;hore, in a &s;mall bay upon the main, within the i&s;land. At eleven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 16.</NOTE> we brought to till day-light, and then made &s;ail to the &s;outhward, along the &s;hore. About &s;even o'clock we pa&s;t a high point of land, which lies S. S. W. twelve leagues from Cape Kidnappers: from this point the land trends three-fourths of a point more to the we&s;tward; at ten, we &s;aw more land open to the &s;outh|ward, and at noon, the &s;outhermo&s;t land that was in &s;ight, bore S. 39 W. di&s;tant eight or ten leagues, and a high bluff head, with yellowi&s;h cliffs, bore W. di&s;tant about two miles: the depth of water was thirty-two fathom.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we had a fre&s;h breeze at we&s;t, and during the night variable light airs and calms:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 17.</NOTE> in the morning a gentle breeze &s;prung up between the N. W. and N. E. and having till now &s;tood to the &s;outhward, without &s;eeing any probability of meeting with a harbour, and the country ma|nife&s;tly altering for the wor&s;e, I thought that &s;tanding farther in that direction would be attended with no advantage, but on the contrary would be a lo&s;s of time that might be em|ployed with a better pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in examining the coa&s;t to the northward; about one, therefore, in the after|noon, I tacked, and &s;tood north, with a fre&s;h breeze at we&s;t. The high bluff head, with yellowi&s;h cliffs, which we were
<PB N="308" REF="343">
a-brea&s;t of at noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Tue&s;day 17.</NOTE> I called CAPE TURNAGAIN, becau&s;e here we turned back. It lies in latitude 40&deg; 34&prime; S. longitude 182&deg; 55&prime; W. di&s;tant eighteen leagues S. S. W. and S. S. W. &frac12; W. from Cape Kidnappers. The land between them is of a very un|equal height; in &s;ome places it is lofty next the &s;ea with white cliffs, in others low, with &s;andy beaches: the face of the country is not &s;o well clothed with wood as it is about Hawke's bay, but looks more like our high downs in Eng|land: it is, however, to all appearance, well inhabited, for as we &s;tood along the &s;hore, we &s;aw &s;everal villages, not only in the vallies, but on the tops and &s;ides of the hills, and &s;moke in many other places. The ridge of mountains which has been mentioned before, extends to the &s;outhward farther than we could &s;ee, and was then every where che|quered with &s;now. At night we &s;aw two fires inland, &s;o very large, that we concluded they mu&s;t have been made to clear the land for tillage; but however that be, they are a demon&s;tration that the part of the country where they ap|peared is inhabited.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 18.</NOTE>On the 18th, at four o'clock in the morning, Cape Kid|nappers bore N. 32 W. di&s;tant two leagues: in this &s;ituation we had &s;ixty-two fathom, and when the Cape bore W. by N. di&s;tant three or four leagues, we had forty-five fathom: in the mid-way between the i&s;le of Portland and the Cape we had &s;ixty-five fathom. In the evening, being a-brea&s;t of the penin&s;ula within Portland i&s;land, called TERAKAKO,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terakako.</NOTE> a canoe came off from that &s;hore, and with much difficulty overtook the &s;hip; there were on board five people, two of whom appeared to be Chiefs, and the other three &s;ervants: the Chiefs, with very little invitation came on board, and ordered the re&s;t to remain in their canoe. We treated them with great kindne&s;s, and they were not backward in expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="309" REF="344">
their &s;atisfaction; they went down into the cabbin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Wedne&s;. 18.</NOTE> and after a &s;hort time told us that they had determined not to go on &s;hore till the next morning. As the &s;leeping on board was an honour which we neither expected nor de&s;ired, I re|mon&s;trated &s;trongly again&s;t it, and told them, that on their account it would not be proper, as the &s;hip would probably be at a great di&s;tance from where &s;he was then, the next morning: they per&s;i&s;ted, however, in their re&s;olution, and as I found it impo&s;&s;ible to get rid of them without turning them by force out of the &s;hip, I complied: as a proper pre|caution, however, I propo&s;ed to take their &s;ervants al&s;o on board, and hoi&s;t their canoe into the &s;hip; they made no ob|jection, and this was accordingly done. The countenance of one of the&s;e Chiefs was the mo&s;t open and ingenuous of all I have ever &s;een, and I very &s;oon gave up every &s;u&s;picion of his having any &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign: they both examined every thing they &s;aw with great curio&s;ity and attention, and re|ceived very thankfully &s;uch little pre&s;ents as we made them; neither of them, however, could be per&s;uaded either to eat or drink, but their &s;ervants devoured every thing they could get with great voracity. We found that the&s;e men had heard of our kindne&s;s and liberality to the natives who had been on board before, yet we thought the confidence they placed in us, an extraordinary in&s;tance of their fortitude. At night I brought to till day-light, and then made &s;ail;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 19.</NOTE> at &s;even in the morning, I brought to again under Cape Table, and &s;ent away our gue&s;ts with their canoe, who expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;ur|pri&s;e at &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;o far from home, but landed a-brea&s;t of the &s;hip. At this time I &s;aw other canoes putting off from the &s;hore, but I &s;tood away to the northward with|out waiting for their coming up.</P>
<P>About three, I pa&s;&s;ed a remarkable head land, which I called GABLE-END-FORELAND, from the very great likene&s;s
<PB N="310" REF="345">
of the white cliff at the point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Thur&s;day 19.</NOTE> to the gable-end of a hou&s;e: it is not more remarkable for its figure, than for a rock which ri&s;es like a &s;pire at a little di&s;tance. It lies from Cape Table N. 24 E. di&s;tant about twelve leagues. The &s;hore be|tween them forms a bay, within which lies Poverty bay, at the di&s;tance of four leagues from the head land, and eight from the Cape. At this place three canoes came off to us, and one man came on board; we gave him &s;ome trifles, and he &s;oon returned to his boat, which, with all the re&s;t, dropped a-&s;tern.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 20.</NOTE>In the morning I made &s;ail in &s;hore, in order to look into two bays, which appeared about two leagues to the north|ward of the Foreland; the &s;outhermo&s;t I could not fetch, but I anchored in the other about eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>Into this bay we were invited by the people on board many canoes, who pointed to a place where they &s;aid there was plenty of fre&s;h water: I did not find &s;o good a &s;helter from the &s;ea as I expected, but the natives who came about us, appearing to be of a friendly di&s;po&s;ition, I was determined to try whether I could not get &s;ome knowlege of the country here before I proceeded farther to the northward.</P>
<P>In one of the canoes that came about us as &s;oon as we an|chored, we &s;aw two men, who by their habits appeared to be Chiefs: one of them was dre&s;&s;ed in a jacket, which was or|namented, after their manner, with dog's &s;kin; the jacket of the other was almo&s;t covered with &s;mall tufts of red feathers. The&s;e men I invited on board, and they entered the &s;hip with very little he&s;itation: I gave each of them about four yards of linen, and a &s;pike nail; with the linen they were much plea&s;ed, but &s;eemed to &s;et no value upon the nail. We per|ceived that they knew what had happened in Poverty bay, and we had therefore no rea&s;on to doubt but that they would
<PB N="311" REF="346">
behave peaceably; however, for further &s;ecurity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Friday 20.</NOTE> Tupia was ordered to tell them for what purpo&s;e we came thither, and to a&s;&s;ure them that we would offer them no injury, if they offered none to us. In the mean time tho&s;e who re|mained in the canoes traded with our people very fairly for what they happened to have with them: the Chiefs, who were old men, &s;taid with us till we had dined, and about two o'clock I put off with the boats, manned and armed, in order to go on &s;hore in &s;earch of water, and the two Chiefs went into the boat with me. The afternoon was tempe&s;tuous, with much rain, and the &s;urf every where ran &s;o high, that although we rowed almo&s;t round the bay, we found no place where we could land: I determined therefore to return to the &s;hip, which being intimated to the Chiefs, they called to the people on &s;hore, and ordered a canoe to be &s;ent off for them&s;elves; this was accordingly done, and they left us, promi&s;ing to come on board again in the morning, and bring us &s;ome fi&s;h and &s;weet potatoes.</P>
<P>In the evening, the weather having become fair and mo|derate, the boats were again ordered out, and I landed, ac|companied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We were received with great expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip by the natives, who be|haved with a &s;crupulous attention not to give offence. In particular, they took care not to appear in great bodies: one family, or the inhabitants of two or three hou&s;es only, were generally placed together, to the number of fifteen or twenty, con&s;i&s;ting of men, women, and children. The&s;e little companies &s;at upon the ground, not advancing towards us, but inviting us to them, by a kind of beckon, moving one hand towards the brea&s;t. We made them &s;everal little pre&s;ents; and in our walk round the bay found two &s;mall &s;treams of fre&s;h water. This convenience, and the friendly behaviour of the people, determined me to &s;tay at lea&s;t a
<PB N="312" REF="347">
day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October.</NOTE> that I might fill &s;ome of my empty ca&s;ks, and give Mr. Banks an opportunity of examining the natural produce of the country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 21.</NOTE>In the morning of the 21&s;t, I &s;ent Lieutenant Gore on &s;hore, to &s;uperintend the watering, with a &s;trong party of men; and they were &s;oon followed by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with Tupia, Tayeto, and four others.</P>
<P>The natives &s;at by our people, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed to ob|&s;erve them; but did not intermix with them: they traded however, chiefly for cloth, and after a &s;hort time applied to their ordinary occupations, as if no &s;tranger had been among them. In the forenoon, &s;everal of their boats went out a fi&s;hing, and at dinner time every one repaired to his re&s;pective dwelling; from which, after a certain time, he returned. The&s;e fair appearances encouraged Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander to range the bay with very little precaution, where they found many plants, and &s;hot &s;ome birds of ex|qui&s;ite beauty. In their walk, they vi&s;ited &s;everal hou&s;es of the natives, and &s;aw &s;omething of their manner of life; for they &s;howed, without any re&s;erve, every thing which the Gentlemen de&s;ired to &s;ee. They were &s;ometimes found at their meals, which the approach of the &s;trangers never in|terrupted. Their food at this &s;ea&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of fi&s;h, with which, in&s;tead of bread, they eat the root of a kind of fern, very like that which grows upon our commons in England. The&s;e roots they &s;corch over the fire, and then beat with a &s;tick, till the bank and dry out&s;ide fall off; what remains is a &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance, &s;omewhat clammy and &s;weet, not unplea&s;|ing to the ta&s;te, but mixed with three or four times its quan|tity of &s;trings and fibres, which are very di&s;agreeable; the&s;e were &s;wallowed by &s;ome, but &s;pit out by the far greater number, who had ba&s;kets under them to receive the rejected

part of what had been chewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Saturday 21.</NOTE> which had an appearance very like that of tobacco in the &s;ame &s;tate. In other &s;ea&s;ons they have certainly plenty of excellent vegetables; but no tame animals were &s;een among them except dogs, which were very &s;mall and ugly. Mr. Banks &s;aw &s;ome of their plantations, where the ground was as well broken down and tilled as even in the gardens of the mo&s;t curious people among us: in the&s;e &s;pots were &s;weet potatoes, coccos or eddas, which are well known and much e&s;teemed both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, and &s;ome gourds: the &s;weet po|tatoes were planted in &s;mall hills, &s;ome ranged in rows, and others in quincunx, all laid by a line with the greate&s;t regu|larity: the coccos were planted upon flat land, but none of them yet appeared above ground; and the gourds were &s;et in &s;mall hollows, or di&s;hes, much as in England. The&s;e plantations were of different extent, from one or two acres to ten: taken together, there appeared to be from 150 to 200 acres in cultivation in the whole bay, though we never &s;aw an hundred people. Each di&s;trict was fenced in, gene|rally with reeds, which were placed &s;o clo&s;e together that there was &s;carcely room for a mou&s;e to creep between.</P>
<P>The women were plain, and made them&s;elves more &s;o by painting their faces with red ocre and oil, which being ge|nerally fre&s;h and wet upon their cheeks and foreheads, was ea&s;ily transferred to the no&s;es of tho&s;e who thought fit to &s;alute them; and that they were not wholly aver&s;e to &s;uch familiarity, the no&s;es of &s;everal of our people &s;trongly te&s;ti|fied: they were, however, as great coquets as any of the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable ladies in Europe, and the young ones as &s;kitti&s;h as an unbroken filly: each of them wore a petticoat, under which there was a girdle, made of the blades of gra&s;s highly perfumed, and to the girdle was fa&s;tened a &s;mall bunch of the leaves of &s;ome fragrant plant, which &s;erved
<PB N="314" REF="349">
their mode&s;ty as its innermo&s;t veil.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Saturday 21.</NOTE> The faces of the men were not &s;o generally painted, yet we &s;aw one who&s;e whole body, and even his garments, were rubbed over with dry ocre, of which he kept a piece con&s;tantly in his hand, and was every minute renewing the decoration in one part or an|other, where he &s;uppo&s;ed it was become deficient. In per|&s;onal delicacy they were not equal to our friends at Ota|heite, for the coldne&s;s of the climate did not invite them &s;o often to bathe; but we &s;aw among them one in&s;tance of cleanline&s;s in which they exceeded them, and of which per|haps there is no example in any other Indian nation. Every hou&s;e, or every little clu&s;ter of three or four hou&s;es, was furni&s;hed with a privy, &s;o that the ground was every where clean. The offals of their food, and other litter, were al&s;o piled up in regular dunghills, which probably they made u&s;e of at a proper time for manure.</P>
<P>In this decent article of civil oeconomy they were before|hand with one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable nations of Europe, for I am credibly informed, that, till the year 1760, there was no &s;uch thing as a privy in Madrid, the metropolis of Spain, though it is plentifully &s;upplied with water. Before that time it was the univer&s;al practice to throw the ordure out of the windows, during the night, into the &s;treet, where num|bers of men were employed to remove it, with &s;hovels, from the upper parts of the city to the lower, where it lay till it was dry, and was then carried away in carts, and depo&s;ited without the gates. His pre&s;ent Catholic Maje&s;ty, having de|termined to free his capital from &s;o gro&s;s a nui&s;ance, ordered, by proclamation, that the proprietor of every hou&s;e &s;hould build a privy, and that &s;inks, drains, and common-&s;ewers &s;hould be made at the public expence. The Spaniards, though long accu&s;tomed to an arbitrary government, re|&s;ented this proclamation with great &s;pirit, as an infringe|ment
<PB N="315" REF="350">
of the common rights of mankind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Saturday 21.</NOTE> and made a vigo|rous &s;truggle again&s;t its being carried into execution. Every cla&s;s devi&s;ed &s;ome objection again&s;t it, but the phy&s;icians bid the faire&s;t to intere&s;t the king in the pre&s;ervation of the an|cient privileges of his people; for they remon&s;trated that if the filth was not, as u&s;ual, thrown into the &s;treets, a fatal &s;ickne&s;s would probably en&s;ue, becau&s;e the putre&s;cent par|ticles of the air, which &s;uch filth attracted, would then be imbibed by the human body. But this expedient, with every other that could be thought of, proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the popular di&s;content then ran &s;o high that it was very near producing an in&s;urrection; his maje&s;ty, however, at length prevailed, and Madrid is now as clear as mo&s;t of the con&s;i|derable cities in Europe. But many of the citizens, pro|bably upon the principles advanced by their phy&s;icians, that heaps of filth prevent deleterious particles of air from fixing upon neighbouring &s;ub&s;tances, have, to keep their food whole&s;ome, con&s;tructed their privies by the kitchen fire.</P>
<P>In the evening, all our boats being employed in carrying the water on board, and Mr. Banks and his company finding it probable that they &s;hould be left on &s;hore after it was dark, by which much time would be lo&s;t, which they were impatient to employ in putting the plants they had gathered in order, they applied to the Indians for a pa&s;&s;age in one of their canoes: they immediately con&s;ented, and a canoe was launched for their u&s;e. They went all on board, being eight in number, but not being u&s;ed to a ve&s;&s;el that required &s;o even a balance, they unfortunately over&s;et her in the &s;urf: no life however was lo&s;t, but it was thought advi&s;able that half of them &s;hould wait for another turn. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and Tayeto embarked again, and without any farther accident arrived &s;afely at the &s;hip, well plea&s;ed with the good-nature of their Indian friends, who cheer|fully
<PB N="316" REF="351">
under&s;took to carry them a &s;econd time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Saturday 21.</NOTE> after having experienced how unfit a freight they were for &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>While the&s;e gentlemen were on &s;hore, &s;everal of the na|tives went off to the &s;hip, and trafficked, by exchanging their cloth for that of Otaheite: of this barter they were for &s;ome time very fond, preferring the Indian cloth to that of Europe; but before night it decrea&s;ed in its value five hundred per cent. Many of the&s;e Indians I took on board, and &s;hewed them the &s;hip and her apparatus, at which they expre&s;&s;ed equal &s;atisfaction and a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>As I found it exceedingly difficult to get water on board on account of the &s;urf, I determined to &s;tay no longer at this place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 22.</NOTE> on the next morning therefore, about five o'clock, I weighed anchor and put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>This bay, which is called by the natives TEGADOO, lies in the latitude of 38&deg; 10&prime; S., but as it has nothing to recom|mend it, a de&s;cription of it is unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>From this bay I intended to &s;tand on to the northward, but the wind being right again&s;t me, I could make no way. While I was beating about to windward, &s;ome of the natives came on board, and told me, that in a bay which lay a little to the &s;outhward, being the &s;ame that I could not fetch the day I put into Tegadoo, there was excellent water, where the boats might land without a &s;urf. I thought it better therefore to put into this bay, where I might complete my water, and form farther connexions with the Indians, than to keep the &s;ea. With this view I bore up for it, and &s;ent in two boats, manned and armed, to examine the watering-place, who confirming the report of the Indians at their re|turn, I came to an anchor about one o'clock, in eleven fa|thom water, with a fine &s;andy bottom, the north point of the bay N. by E. and the &s;outh point S. E. The watering-place,
<PB N="317" REF="352">
which was in a &s;mall cove a little within the &s;outh point of the bay, bore S. by E. di&s;tant about a mile.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Sunday 22.</NOTE> Many canoes came immediately off from the &s;hore, and all traded very ho|ne&s;tly for Otaheite cloth and gla&s;s bottles, of which they were immoderately fond.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 23d, as &s;oon as the &s;hip was moored,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 23.</NOTE> I went on &s;hore to examine the watering-place, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander: the boat landed in the cove, without the lea&s;t &s;urf; the water was excellent, and conve|niently &s;ituated; there was plenty of wood clo&s;e to high-water mark, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the people was in every re&s;pect &s;uch as we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>Having, with Mr. Green, taken &s;everal ob&s;ervations of the &s;un and moon, the mean re&s;ult of them gave 180&deg; 47&prime; W. longitude; but, as all the ob&s;ervations made before exceeded the&s;e, I have laid down the coa&s;t from the mean of the whole. At noon, I took the &s;un's meridian altitude with an a&s;tronomical quadrant, which was &s;et up at the watering-place, and found the latitude to be 38&deg; 22&prime; 24&Prime;.</P>
<P>On the 24th, early in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 24.</NOTE> I &s;ent Lieutenant Gore on &s;hore, to &s;uperintend the cutting of wood and filling of water, with a &s;ufficient number of men for both purpo&s;es, and all the marines as a guard. After breakfa&s;t, I went on &s;hore my&s;elf, and continued there the whole day.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander al&s;o went on &s;hore to gather plants, and in their walks &s;aw &s;everal things worthy of no|tice. They met with many hou&s;es in the vallies that &s;eemed to be wholly de&s;erted, the people living on the ridges of the hills in a kind of &s;heds very &s;lightly built. As they were advancing in one of the&s;e vallies, the hills on each &s;ide of which were very &s;teep, they were &s;uddenly &s;truck with the fight of a very extraordinary natural curio&s;ity. It was a rock,
<PB N="318" REF="353">
perforated through its whole &s;ub&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Tue&s;day 24.</NOTE> &s;o as to form a rude but &s;tupendous arch or cavern, opening directly to the &s;ea; this aperture was &s;eventy-five feet long, twenty-&s;even broad, and five and forty high, commanding a view of the bay and the hills on the other &s;ide, which were &s;een through it, and, opening at once upon the view, produced an effect far &s;upe|rior to any of the contrivances of art.</P>
<P>As they were returning to the watering-place in the even|ing they met an old man, who detained them &s;ome time by &s;howing them the military exerci&s;es of the country with the lance and Patoo-Patoo, which are all the weapons in u&s;e. The lance is from ten to fourteen feet long, made of a very hard wood, and &s;harp at both ends: the Patoo-Patoo has been de&s;cribed already, it is about a foot long, made of Talc or bone, with &s;harp edges, and u&s;ed as a battle-axe. A po&s;t or &s;take was &s;et up as his enemy, to which he advanced with a mo&s;t furious a&s;pect, brandi&s;hing his lance, which he gra&s;ped with great firmne&s;s; when it was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been pierced by his lance, he ran at it with his Patoo-Patoo, and falling upon the upper end of it, which was to repre&s;ent his adver&s;ary's head, he laid on with great vehemence, &s;triking many blows, any one of which would probably have &s;plit the &s;cull of an ox. From our champion's falling upon his mock enemy with the Patoo-Patoo, after he was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been pierced with the lance, our Gentlemen inferred, that in the battles of this country there is no quarter.</P>
<P>This afternoon, we &s;et up the armourer's forge, to repair the braces of the tiller which had been broken, and went on getting our wood and water, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t mo|le&s;tation from the natives; who came down with different &s;orts of fi&s;h, which we purcha&s;ed with cloth, beads, and gla&s;s bottles, as u&s;ual.</P>

<P><PB N="319" REF="355">On the 25th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Wedne&s;. 25.</NOTE> Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went again on &s;hore; and while they were &s;earching for plants, Tupia &s;taid with the waterers: among other Indians who came down to them, was a prie&s;t, with whom Tupia entered into a very learned conver&s;ation. In their notions of religion they &s;eemed to agree very well, which is not often the ca&s;e be|tween learned divines on our &s;ide of the ocean: Tupia, how|ever, &s;eemed to have the mo&s;t knowlege, and he was li&s;tened to with great deference and attention by the other. In the cour&s;e of this conver&s;ation, after the important points of di|vinity had been &s;ettled, Tupia enquired if it was their prac|tice to eat men, to which they an&s;wered in the affirmative; but &s;aid that they eat only their enemies who were &s;lain in battle.</P>
<P>On the 26th, it rained all day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 26.</NOTE> &s;o that none of us could go a&s;hore; and very few of the Indians came either to the wa|tering-place or the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 27th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 27.</NOTE> I went with Dr. Solander to examine the bot|tom of the bay; but though we went a&s;hore at two places, we met with little worth notice. The people behaved very civilly, &s;hewing us every thing that we expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire to &s;ee. Among other trifling curio&s;ities which Dr. Solander purcha&s;ed of them, was a boy's top, &s;haped exactly like tho&s;e which children play with in England; and they made &s;igns, that to make it &s;pin it was to be whipped. Mr. Banks in the mean time went a&s;hore at the watering-place, and climbed a hill which &s;tood at a little di&s;tance to &s;ee a fence of poles, which we had ob&s;erved from the &s;hip, and which had been much the &s;ubject of &s;peculation. The hill was ex|tremely &s;teep, and rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by wood; yet he reached the place, near which he found many hou&s;es that for &s;ome rea&s;on had been de&s;erted by their inhabitants.
<PB N="320" REF="356">
The poles appeared to be about &s;ixteen feet high;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Friday 27.</NOTE> they were placed in two rows, with a &s;pace of about &s;ix feet between them, and the poles in each row were about ten feet di&s;tant from each other. The lane between them was covered by &s;ticks, that were &s;et up &s;loping towards each other from the top of the poles on each &s;ide, like the roof of a hou&s;e. This rail-work, with a ditch that was parallel to it, was carried about a hundred yards down the hill in a kind of curve; but for what purpo&s;e we could not gue&s;s.</P>
<P>The Indians, at the watering-place, at our reque&s;t, enter|tained us with their war-&s;ong, in which the women joined, with the mo&s;t horrid di&s;tortions of countenance, rolling their eyes, thru&s;ting out their tongues, and often heaving loud and deep &s;ighs; though all was done in very good time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 28.</NOTE>On the 28th, we went a&s;hore upon an i&s;land that lies to the left hand of the entrance of the bay, where we &s;aw the large&s;t canoe that we had yet met with: &s;he was &s;ixty-eight feet and a half long, five broad, and three feet &s;ix high; &s;he had a &s;harp bottom, con&s;i&s;ting of three trunks of trees hol|lowed, of which that in the middle was the longe&s;t: the &s;ide planks were &s;ixty-two feet long in one piece, and were not de&s;picably carved in bas relief; the head al&s;o was adorned with carving &s;till more richly. Upon this i&s;land there was a larger hou&s;e than any we had yet &s;een; but it &s;eemed un|fini&s;hed and was full of chips. The wood work was &s;quared &s;o even and &s;mooth, that we made no doubt of their having among them very &s;harp tools. The &s;ides of the po&s;ts were carved in a ma&s;terly &s;tile, though after their whim&s;ical ta&s;te, which &s;eems to prefer &s;piral lines and di&s;torted faces: as the&s;e carved po&s;ts appeared to have been brought from &s;ome other place, &s;uch work is probably of great value among them.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="357">At four o'clock in the morning of the 29th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Sunday 29.</NOTE> having got on board our wood and water, and a large &s;upply of excellent celery, with which the country abounds, and which proved a powerful anti&s;corbutic, I unmoored and put to &s;ea.</P>
<P>This bay is called by the natives TOLAGA; it is moderately large, and has from &s;even to thirteen fathom, with a clean &s;andy bottom and good anchorage; and is &s;heltered from all winds except the north ea&s;t. It lies in latitude 38&deg; 22&prime; S. and four leagues and an half to the north of Gable-end Foreland. On the &s;outh point lies a &s;mall but high i&s;land, &s;o near the main as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from it. Clo&s;e to the north end of the i&s;land, at the entrance into the bay, are two high rocks; one is round like a corn-&s;tack, but the other is long, and perforated in &s;everal places &s;o that the openings appear like the arches of a bridge. Within the&s;e rocks is the cove where we cut wood, and filled our water-ca&s;ks. Off the north point of the bay is a pretty high rocky i&s;land; and about a mile without it, are &s;ome rocks and breakers. The variation of the compa&s;s here is 14&deg; 31&prime; E. and the tide flows at the full and change of the moon, about &s;ix o'clock, and ri&s;es and falls perpendicularly from five to &s;ix feet: whether the flood comes from the &s;outhward or the northward I have not been able to determine.</P>
<P>We got nothing here by traffic but a few fi&s;h, and &s;ome &s;weet potatoes, except a few trifles, which we con&s;idered merely as curio&s;ities. We &s;aw no four-footed animals, nor the appearance of any, either tame or wild, except dogs and rats, and the&s;e were very &s;carce: the people eat the dogs, like our friends at Otaheite; and adorn their gar|ments with the &s;kins, as we do ours with fur and ermine. I climbed many of the hills, hoping to get a view of the coun|try, but I could &s;ee nothing from the top except higher

The ridges of the&s;e hills produce little be&s;ides fern; but the &s;ides are mo&s;t luxuriantly clothed with wood, and verdure of various kinds, with little plantations intermixed. In the woods, we found trees of above twenty different &s;orts, and carried &s;pecimens of each on board; but there was no body among us to whom they were not altogether unknown. The tree which we cut for firing was &s;omewhat like our maple, and yielded a whiti&s;h gum. We found another &s;ort of it of a deep yellow, which we thought might be u&s;eful in dying. We found al&s;o one cabbage tree, which we cut down for the cabbages. The country abounds with plants, and the woods with birds, in an endle&s;s variety, exqui&s;itely beautiful, and of which none of us had the lea&s;t knowlege. The &s;oil both of the hills and valleys is light and &s;andy, and very fit for the production of all kinds of roots; though we &s;aw none except &s;weet pota|toes and yams.</P>

<P>ON Monday the 30th, about half an hour after one o'clock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Monday 30.</NOTE> having made &s;ail again to the northward for about ten hours, with a light breeze, I hauled round a &s;mall i&s;land which lay ea&s;t one mile from the north ea&s;t point of the land: from this place I found the land trend away N.W. by W. and W. N. W. as far as I could &s;ee, this point being the ea&s;t|ermo&s;t land on the whole coa&s;t. I gave it the name of EAST CAPE, and I called the i&s;land that lies off it EAST ISLAND; it is of a &s;mall circuit, high and round, and appears white and barren: the Cape is high, with white cliffs, and lies in lati|tude 37&deg; 42&prime; 30&Prime; S. and longitude 181&deg; W. The land from Tolaga Bay to Ea&s;t Cape is of a moderate, but unequal height, forming &s;everal &s;mall bays, in which are &s;andy beaches: of the inland country we could not &s;ee much, the weather being cloudy and hazey. The &s;oundings were from twenty to thirty fathom at the di&s;tance of about a league from the &s;hore. After we had rounded the Cape, we &s;aw in our run along the &s;hore a great number of villages, and much cultivated land; the country in general appeared more fertile than before, and was low near the &s;ea, but hilly within. At &s;ix in the evening, being four leagues to the we&s;tward of Ea&s;t Cape, we pa&s;&s;ed a bay which was fir&s;t di&s;|covered
<PB N="324" REF="361">
by Lieutenant Hicks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. October. Monday 30.</NOTE> and which therefore I called HICKS's BAY. At eight in the evening, being eight leagues to the we&s;tward of the Cape, and three or four miles from the &s;hore, I &s;hortened &s;ail and brought to for the night, having at this time a fre&s;h gale at S.S.E. and &s;qually; but it &s;oon became moderate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 31.</NOTE> and at two in the morning, we made &s;ail again to the S.

When one of the&s;e canoes had almo&s;t reached the &s;hip, another, of an immen&s;e &s;ize, the large&s;t we had yet &s;een, crowded with people who were al&s;o armed, put off from the &s;hore, and came up at a great rate; as it approach|ed it received &s;ignals from the canoe that was neare&s;t to the &s;hip, and we could &s;ee that it had &s;ixteen paddles on a &s;ide, be&s;ide people that &s;at, and others that &s;tood in a row from &s;tem to &s;tern, being in all about &s;ixty men: as they made directly to the &s;hip, we were de&s;irous of preventing an attack, by &s;howing what we could do; and therefore fired a gun, loaded with grape-&s;hot, ahead of them: this made them &s;top, but not retreat; a round &s;hot was then fired over them, and upon &s;eeing it fall, they &s;eized their paddles and made to|wards the &s;hore with &s;uch precipitation that they &s;eemed &s;carcely to allow them&s;elves time to breathe. In the evening, three or four more canoes came off unarmed; but they would not venture within a mu&s;quet &s;hot of the ve&s;&s;el. The cape, off which we had been threatened with ho&s;tilities, I

The&s;e people traded pretty fairly: but when they were gone, &s;ome others came off from another place, who began al&s;o to trade fairly; but after &s;ome time they took what was handed down to them, without making any return; one of them who had done &s;o, upon being threatened, began to laugh, and with many marks of deri&s;ion &s;et us at defiance, at the &s;ame time putting off the canoe from the &s;hip: a mu&s;quet was then fired over his head, which brought him back in a more &s;erious mood, and trade went on with great regularity. At length, when the cabbin and gun-room had got as much as they wanted, the men were allowed to come to the gang-way, and trade for them|&s;elves. Unhappily the &s;ame care was not taken to prevent frauds as had been taken before, &s;o that the Indians, finding that they could cheat with impunity, grew in&s;olent again, and proceeded to take greater liberties. One of the canoes, having &s;old every thing on board, pulled forward, and the people that were in her &s;eeing &s;ome linen hang over the &s;hip's &s;ide to dry, one of them, without any ceremony, un|tied it, and put it up in his bundle: he was immediately called to, and required to return it; in&s;tead of which, he let his canoe drop a &s;tern, and laughed at us: a mu&s;quet was fired over his head, which did not put a &s;top to his mirth; another was then fired at him with &s;mall &s;hot, which &s;truck
<PB N="326" REF="363">
him upon the back;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s;. 1.</NOTE> he &s;hrunk a little when the &s;hot hit him, but did not regard it more than one or our men would have done the &s;troke of a rattan: he continued with great compo&s;ure to pack up the linen that he had &s;tolen. All the canoes now dropped a&s;tern about a hundred yards, and all &s;et up their &s;ong of defiance, which they continued till the &s;hip was di&s;tant from them about four hundred yards. As they &s;eemed to have no de&s;ign to attack us, I was not wil|ling to do them any hurt; yet I thought their going off in a bravado might have a bad effect when it &s;hould be reported a&s;hore. To &s;how them therefore that they were &s;till in our power, though very much beyond the reach of any mi&s;&s;ile weapon with which they were acquainted, I gave the &s;hip a yaw, and fired a four pounder &s;o as to pa&s;s near them. The &s;hot happened to &s;trike the water, and ri&s;e &s;everal times at a great di&s;tance beyond the canoes: this &s;truck them with terror, and they paddled away without once looking behind them.</P>
<P>About two in the afternoon, we &s;aw a pretty high i&s;land bearing we&s;t from us; and at five, &s;aw more i&s;lands and rocks to the we&s;tward of that. We hauled our wind in or|der to go without them, but could not weather them before it was dark. I therefore bore up, and ran between them and the main. At &s;even, I was clo&s;e under the fir&s;t, from which a large double canoe, or rather two canoes la&s;hed together at the di&s;tance of about a foot, and covered with boards &s;o as make a deck, put off, and made &s;ail for the &s;hip: this was the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el of the kind that we had &s;een &s;ince we left the South Sea i&s;lands. When &s;he came near, the people on board entered very freely into conver&s;ation with Tupia, and we thought &s;howed a friendly di&s;po&s;ition; but when it was ju&s;t dark, they ran their canoe clo&s;e to the &s;hip's &s;ide, and threw in a volley of &s;tones, after which they paddled a&s;hore.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="364">We learnt from Tupia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s;. 1.</NOTE> that the people in the canoe called the i&s;land which we were under MOWTOHORA; it is but of a &s;mall circuit, though high, and lies &s;ix miles from the main; on the &s;outh &s;ide is anchorage in fourteen fathom water. Upon the main land S. W. by W. of this i&s;land, and appa|rently at no great di&s;tance from the &s;ea, is a high round mountain, which I called MOUNT EDGECOMBE: it &s;tands in the middle of a large plain, and is therefore the more con&s;pi|cuous; latitude 37&deg; 59&prime;, longitude 193&deg; 7&prime;.</P>
<P>In &s;tanding we&s;tward, we &s;uddenly &s;hoaled our water from &s;eventeen to ten fathom; and knowing that we were not far from the &s;mall i&s;lands and rocks which we had &s;een before dark, and which I intended to have pa&s;&s;ed before I brought to for the night, I thought it more prudent to tack, and &s;pend the night under Mowtohora, where I knew there was no danger. It was indeed happy for us that we did &s;o; for in the morning, after we had made &s;ail to the we&s;tward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 2.</NOTE> we di&s;covered, ahead of us, &s;everal rocks, &s;ome of which were level with the &s;urface of the water, and &s;ome below it: they lay N. N. E. from Mount Edgecombe, one league and a half di&s;tant from the i&s;land Mowtohora, and about nine miles from the main. We pa&s;&s;ed between the&s;e rocks and the main, having from ten to &s;even fathom water.</P>
<P>This morning, many canoes and much people were &s;een along the &s;hore; &s;everal of the canoes followed us, but none of them could reach us, except one with a &s;ail, which proved to be the &s;ame that had pelted us the night before. The people on board again entered into conver&s;ation with Tupia; but we expected another volley of their ammunition, which was not indeed dangerous to any thing but the cabbin win|dows. They continued abrea&s;t of the &s;hip about an hour, and behaved very peaceably; but at la&s;t the &s;alute which we
<PB N="328" REF="365">
expected was given;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Thur&s;day 2.</NOTE> we returned it by firing a mu&s;quet over them, and they immediately dropped a-&s;tern and left us, perhaps rather &s;atisfied with having given a te&s;t of their cou|rage by twice in&s;ulting a ve&s;&s;el &s;o much &s;uperior to their own, than intimidated by the &s;hot.</P>
<P>At half an hour after ten, we pa&s;&s;ed between a low flat i&s;land and the main: the di&s;tance from one to the other was about four miles, and the depth of water from ten to twelve fa|thom. The main land between this flat i&s;land and Mowto|hora is of a moderate height, but level, pretty clear of wood, and full of plantations and villages. The villages, which were larger than any we had yet &s;een, were built upon eminences near the &s;ea, and fortified on the land &s;ide by a bank and ditch, with a high paling within it, which was carried all round: be&s;ide a bank, ditch, and palli&s;adoes, &s;ome of them appeared to have out-works. Tupia had a notion that the &s;mall inclo&s;ures of palli&s;adoes, and a ditch that we had &s;een before, were Morais or places of wor&s;hip; but we were of opinion that they were forts, and concluded that the&s;e people had neighbouring enemies, and were always expo&s;ed to ho&s;tile attacks.</P>
<P>At two o'clock we pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall high i&s;land, lying four miles from a high round head upon the main. From this head the land trends N. W. as far as can be &s;een, and has a rugged and hilly appearance. As the weather was hazy, and the wind blew fre&s;h on the &s;hore, we hauled off for the weathermo&s;t i&s;land in &s;ight, which bore from us N. N. E. di&s;tant about &s;ix or &s;even leagues.</P>
<P>Under this i&s;land, which I have called the MAYOR, we &s;pent the night.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 3.</NOTE> At &s;even in the morning it bore S. 47 E. di&s;tant &s;ix leagues, and a clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;lands and rocks bore N. &frac12; E. di&s;tant one league, to which I gave the name of
<PB N="329" REF="366">
the COURT OF ALDERMEN.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Friday 3.</NOTE> They lie in the compa&s;s of about half a league every way, and five leagues from the main, between which and them lie other i&s;lands, mo&s;t of them barren rocks, of which there is great variety: &s;ome of them are as &s;mall in compa&s;s as the Monument of London, but ri&s;e to a much greater height, and &s;ome of them are inhabited. They lie in latitude 36&deg; 57&prime;, and at noon bore S. 60 E. di&s;tant three or four leagues; and a rock like a ca&s;tle, lying not far from the main, bore N. 40 W. at the di&s;tance of one league. The country that we pa&s;&s;ed the night before, appeared to be well inhabited, many towns were in &s;ight, and &s;ome hun|dreds of large canoes lay under them upon the beach; but this day, after having &s;ailed about fifteen leagues, it ap|peared to be barren and de&s;olate. As far as we had yet coa&s;ted this country from Cape Turnagain, the people ac|knowledged one Chief, whom they called TERATU, and to who&s;e re&s;idence they pointed, in a direction that we thought to be very far inland, but afterwards found to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>About one o'clock three canoes came off to us from the main, with one and twenty men on board. The con&s;truc|tion of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els appeared to be more &s;imple than that of any we had &s;een, they being nothing more than trunks of a &s;ingle tree hollowed by fire, without any convenience or or|nament. The people on board were almo&s;t naked, and ap|peared to be of a browner complexion; yet naked and de&s;picable as they were, they &s;ung their &s;ong of defiance, and &s;eemed to denounce again&s;t us inevitable de&s;truction: they remained, however, &s;ome time out of &s;tones throw, and then venturing nearer, with le&s;s appearance of ho&s;tility, one of our men went to the &s;hip &s;ide, and was about to hand them a rope; this courte&s;y, however, they thought fit to re|turn by throwing a lance at him, which having mi&s;&s;ed him,
<PB N="330" REF="367">
they immediately threw another into the &s;hip:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Friday 3.</NOTE> upon this a mu&s;quet was fired over them, which at once &s;ent them away.</P>
<P>About two, we &s;aw a large opening, or inlet, for which we bore up; we had new forty one fathom water, which gradually decrea&s;ed to nine, at which time we were one mile and an half di&s;tant from a high towered rock which lay near the &s;outh point of the inlet: this rock, and the norther|mo&s;t of the Court of Aldermen being in one, bearing S. 61 E.</P>
<P>About &s;even in the evening we anchored in &s;even fathom, a little within the &s;outh entrance of the bay: to this place we were accompanied by &s;everal canoes and people like tho&s;e we had &s;een la&s;t, and for &s;ome time they behaved very civilly. While they were hovering about us, a bird was &s;hot from the &s;hip, as it was &s;wimming upon the water: at this they &s;hewed le&s;s &s;urprize than we expected, and taking up the bird, they tied it to a fi&s;hing line that was towing a|&s;tern; as an acknowledgment for this favour we gave them a piece of cloth: but notwith&s;tanding this effect of our fire|arms, and this interchange of civilities, as &s;oon as it grew dark they &s;ung their war &s;ong, and attempted to tow away the buoy of the anchor. Two or three mu&s;kets were then fired over them, but this &s;eemed rather to make them angry than afraid, and they went away, threatening that to-mor|row they would return with more force, and be the death of us all; at the &s;ame time &s;ending off a boat, which they told us was going to another part of the bay for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>There was &s;ome appearance of genero&s;ity, as well as cou|rage, in acquainting us with the time when they intended to make their attack, but they forfeited all credit which this procured them, by coming &s;ecretly upon us in the night,
<PB N="331" REF="368">
when they certainly hoped to find us a&s;leep:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Friday 3.</NOTE> upon approach|ing the &s;hip they found them&s;elves mi&s;taken, and therefore retired without &s;peaking a word, &s;uppo&s;ing that they were too early; after &s;ome time they came a &s;econd time, and being again di&s;appointed, they retired as &s;ilently as before.</P>
<P>In the morning, at day-break,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 4.</NOTE> they prepared to effect by force what they had in vain attempted by &s;tealth and artifice: no le&s;s than twelve canoes came again&s;t us, with about a hundred and fifty men, all armed with pikes, lances, and &s;tones. As they could do nothing till they came very near the &s;hip, Tupia was ordered to expo&s;tulate with them, and if po&s;&s;ible divert them from their purpo&s;e: during the conver|&s;ation they appeared to be &s;ometimes friendly and &s;ometimes otherwi&s;e; at length, however, they began to trade, and we offered to purcha&s;e their weapons, which &s;ome of them con|&s;ented to &s;ell: they &s;old two very fairly, but having received what had been agreed upon for the purcha&s;e of a third, they refu&s;ed to &s;end it up, but offered it for a &s;econd price; a &s;econd was &s;ent down, but the weapon was &s;till detained, and a demand made of a third; this being refu&s;ed with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of di&s;plea&s;ure and re&s;entment, the offender, with many ludicrous tokens of contempt and defiance, pad|dled his canoe off a few yards from the &s;hip. As I intended to continue in this place five or &s;ix days, in order to make an ob&s;ervation of the tran&s;it of Mercury, it was ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to prevent future mi&s;chief, to &s;hew the&s;e people that we were not to be treated ill with impunity; &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot were therefore fired at the thief, and a mu&s;ket ball through the bottom of his boat: upon this it was pad|dled to about a hundred yards di&s;tance, and to our great &s;ur|prize the people in the other canoes took not the lea&s;t notice of their wounded companion, though he bled very much, but returned to the &s;hip, and continued to trade with the

mo&s;t perfect indifference and unconcern.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Saturday 4.</NOTE> They fold us many more of their weapons without making any other attempt to defraud us, for a con&s;iderable time; at la&s;t, how|ever, one of them thought fit to paddle away with two dif|ferent pieces of cloth which had been given for the &s;ame weapon: when he had got about an hundred yards di&s;tance, and thought him&s;elf &s;ecure of his prize, a mu&s;ket was fired after him, which fortunately &s;truck the boat ju&s;t at the wa|ter's edge, and made two holes in her &s;ide; this only incited them to ply their paddles with greater activity, and the re&s;t of the canoes al&s;o made off with the utmo&s;t expedition. As the la&s;t proof of our &s;uperiority therefore, we fired a round &s;hot over them, and not a boat &s;topped till they got on &s;hore.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock, I went with two boats to &s;ound the bay, and look out for a more convenient anchoring-place, the Ma&s;ter being in one boat and my&s;elf in the other. We pulled fir&s;t over to the north &s;hore, from which &s;ome canoes came out to meet us; as we advanced, however, they re|tired, inviting us to follow them: but, &s;eeing them all armed, I did not think it proper to comply, but went towards the head of the bay, where I ob&s;erved a village upon a very high point, fortified in the manner that has been already de&s;cribed, and having fixed upon an anchoring-place not far from where the &s;hip lay, I returned on board.</P>
<P>At three o'clock in the afternoon, I weighed, run in nearer to the &s;hore, and anchored in four fathom and an half water, with a &s;oft &s;andy bottom, the &s;outh point of the bay bearing E. di&s;tant one mile, and a river which the boats can enter at low water S. S. E. di&s;tant a mile and an half.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 5.</NOTE>In the morning, the natives came off again to the &s;hip, and we had the &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve that their behaviour was very different from what it had been ye&s;terday: among
<PB N="333" REF="370">
them was an old man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Sunday 5.</NOTE> whom we had before remarked for his prudence and hone&s;ty: his name was TOIAVA, and he &s;eemed to be a per&s;on of a &s;uperior rank; in the tran&s;actions of ye&s;terday morning he had behaved with great propriety and good &s;en&s;e, lying in a &s;mall canoe, always near the &s;hip, and treating tho&s;e on board as if he neither intended a fraud nor &s;u&s;pected an injury: with &s;ome per&s;ua&s;ion this man and another came on board, and ventured into the cabin, where I pre&s;ented each of them with a piece of Engli&s;h cloth and &s;ome &s;pike nails. They told us that the Indians were now very much afraid of us, and on our part we promi&s;ed friend|&s;hip if they would behave peaceably, de&s;iring only to pur|cha&s;e what they had to &s;ell upon their own terms.</P>
<P>After the natives had left us, I went with the pinnace and long-boat into the river with a de&s;ign to haul the &s;eine, and &s;ent the Ma&s;ter in the yawl to &s;ound the bay and dredge for fi&s;h. The Indians who were on one &s;ide of the river, expre&s;|&s;ed their friend&s;hip by all the &s;igns they could devi&s;e, beck|oning us to land among them; but we cho&s;e to go a&s;hore on the other &s;ide, as the &s;ituation was more convenient for hauling the &s;eine and &s;hooting birds, of which we &s;aw great numbers of various kinds: the Indians with much per&s;ua|&s;ion, about noon, ventured over to us. With the &s;eine we had very little &s;ucce&s;s, catching only a few mullets, neither did we get any thing by the trawl or the dredge, except a few &s;hells; but we &s;hot &s;everal birds, mo&s;t of them re&s;em|bling &s;ea-pies, except that they had black plumage, and red bills and feet. While we were ab&s;ent with our guns, the people who &s;taid by the boats &s;aw two of the Indians quarrel and fight: they began the battle with their lances, but &s;ome old men interpo&s;ed and took them away, leaving them to decide the difference, like Engli&s;hmen, with their fi&s;ts: they boxed with great vigour and ob&s;tinacy for &s;ome time, but by

degrees all retired behind a little hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November.</NOTE> &s;o that our people could not &s;ee the event of the combat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 6.</NOTE>In the morning the long-boat was &s;ent again to traul in the bay, and an officer, with the marines, and a party of men, to cut wood and haul the &s;eine. The Indians on &s;hore ap|peared very peaceable and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and we had rea&s;on to believe that their habitations were at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, for we &s;aw no hou&s;es, and found that they &s;lept under the bu&s;hes: the bay is probably a place to which they frequently re&s;ort in parties to gather &s;hell-fi&s;h, of which it affords in|credible plenty, for wherever we went, whether upon the hills or in the vallies, the woods or the plains, we &s;aw va&s;t heaps of &s;hells, often many waggon loads together, &s;ome appearing to be very old, and others recent. We &s;aw no cultivation in this place, which had a de&s;olate and barren appearance; the tops of the hills were green, but nothing grew there except a large kind of fern, the roots of which the natives had got together in large quantities, in order to carry away with them. In the evening Mr. Banks walked up the river, which at the mouth looked fine and broad, but at the di&s;tance of about two miles was not deep enough to cover the foot; and the country inland was &s;till more barren than at the &s;ea-&s;ide. The &s;eine and dredge were not more &s;ucce&s;sful to-day than ye&s;terday, but the Indians in &s;ome mea&s;ure compen&s;ated for the di&s;appointment by bringing us &s;everal ba&s;kets of fi&s;h, &s;ome dry, and &s;ome fre&s;h dre&s;&s;ed; it was not indeed of the be&s;t, but I ordered it all to be bought for the encouragement of trade.</P>

In a &s;hort time, however, he re|turned, having di&s;covered that the people who had alarmed him were not the &s;ame that he had &s;uppo&s;ed. The natives that came to the &s;hip this morning &s;old us, for a few pieces of cloth, as much fi&s;h of the mackrel kind as &s;erved the whole &s;hip's company, and they were as good as ever were eaten. At noon, this day, I ob&s;erved the &s;un's meridional zenith di&s;tance by an a&s;tronomical quadrant, which gave the latitude 36&deg; 47&prime; 43&Prime; within the &s;outh entrance of the bay.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on &s;hore and collected a great variety of plants, altogether unknown, and not return|ing till the evening, had an opportunity of ob&s;erving in what manner the Indians di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves to pa&s;s the night. They had no &s;helter but a few &s;hrubs: the women and the children were ranged innermo&s;t, or farthe&s;t from the &s;ea; the men lay in a kind of half circle round them, and their arms were &s;et up again&s;t the trees clo&s;e by them, in a man|ner which &s;howed that they were afraid of an attack by &s;ome enemy not far di&s;tant. It was al&s;o di&s;covered that they ac|knowledged neither Teratu, nor any other per&s;on as their king: as in this particular they differed from all the people that we had &s;een upon other parts of the coa&s;t, we thought it po&s;&s;ible that they might be a &s;et of outlaws, in a &s;tate of rebellion again&s;t Teratu, and in that ca&s;e they might have no &s;ettled habitations, or cultivated land in any part of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="373"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Thur&s;day 9.</NOTE>On the 9th, at day-break, a great number of canoes came on board, loaded with mackrel of two &s;orts, one exactly the &s;ame with tho&s;e caught in England, and the other &s;omewhat different: we imagined the people had taken a large &s;hoal, and brought us an overplus which they could not con&s;ume; for they &s;old them at a very low rate. They were, however, very welcome to us; at eight o'clock, the &s;hip had more fi&s;h on board than all her people could eat in three days; and before night, the quantity was &s;o much increa&s;ed, that every man who could get &s;alt, cured as many as would la&s;t him a month.</P>
<P>After an early breakfa&s;t, I went a&s;hore, with Mr. Green and proper in&s;truments, to ob&s;erve the tran&s;it of Mercury, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander being of the party; the weather had for &s;ome time been very thick, with much rain, but this day was &s;o favourable that not a cloud intervened during the whole tran&s;it. The ob&s;ervation of the ingre&s;s was made by Mr. Green alone, while I was employed in taking the &s;un's altitude to a&s;certain the time. It came on at 7^h 20&prime; 58&Prime; apparent time: according to Mr. Green's ob&s;ervation, the in|ternal contact was at 12^h 8&prime; 58&Prime;, the external at 12^h 9&prime; 55&Prime; P.M. And according to mine, the internal contact was at 12^h 8&prime; 54&Prime;, and the external 12^h 9&prime; 48&Prime;; the latitude of the place of ob|&s;ervation was 30&deg; 48&prime; 5&frac12;&Prime;.

It would have been happy, if the effect of a few &s;mall &s;hot had been tried upon this occa&s;ion, which upon &s;ome others had been &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>When the Indian dropped, all the canoes put off to &s;ome di&s;tance; but as they did not go away, it was thought they might &s;till meditate an attack. To &s;ecure therefore a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age for the boat, which it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end on &s;hore, a round &s;hot was fired over their heads, which effectually an&s;wered the purpo&s;e, and put them all to flight. When an account of what had happened was brought a&s;hore, our In|dians
<PB N="338" REF="375">
were alarmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Thur&s;day 9.</NOTE> and drawing all together, retreated in a body. After a &s;hort time, however, they returned, having heard a more particular account of the affair; and intimated that they thought the man who had been killed de&s;erved his fate.</P>
<P>A little before &s;un&s;et the Indians retired to eat their &s;upper, and we went with them to be &s;pectators of the repa&s;t; it con&s;i&s;ted of fi&s;h of different kinds, among which were lob|&s;ters, and &s;ome birds, of a &s;pecies unknown to us: the&s;e were either roa&s;ted or baked; to roa&s;t them, they fa&s;tened them upon a &s;mall &s;tick, which was &s;tuck up in the ground, in|clining towards their fire; and to bake them, they put them into a hole in the ground with hot &s;tones, in the &s;ame man|ner as the people of Otaheite.</P>
<P>Among the natives that were a&s;&s;embled upon this occa&s;ion, we &s;aw a woman, who, after their manner, was mourning for the death of her relation: &s;he &s;at upon the ground near the re&s;t, who, one only excepted, &s;eemed not at all to regard her: the tears con&s;tantly trickled down her cheeks, and &s;he repeated in a low, but very mournful voice, words, which even Tupia did not at all under&s;tand: at the end of every &s;entence &s;he cut her arms, her face, or her brea&s;t with a &s;hell that &s;he held in her hand, &s;o that &s;he was almo&s;t covered with blood, and was indeed one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;pec|tacles that can be conceived. The cuts, however, did not appear to be &s;o deep as are &s;ometimes made upon &s;imilar oc|ca&s;ions, if we may judge by the &s;cars which we &s;aw upon the arms, thighs, brea&s;ts, and cheeks of many of them, which we were told were the remains of wounds which they had inflicted upon them&s;elves as te&s;timonies of their affection and &s;orrow.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 10.</NOTE>The next day, I went with two boats, accompanied by Mr. Banks and the other Gentlemen, to examine a large river
<PB N="339" REF="376">
that empties it&s;elf into the head of the bay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Friday 10.</NOTE> We rowed about four or five miles up, and could have gone much farther if the weather had been favourable. It was here wider than at the mouth, and divided into many &s;treams by &s;mall flat i&s;lands, which are covered with mangroves, and overflowed at high water. From the&s;e trees exudes a vi&s;cous &s;ub&s;tance which very much re&s;embles re&s;in: we found it fir&s;t in &s;mall lumps upon the &s;ea beach, and now &s;aw it &s;ticking to the trees, by which we knew whence it came. We landed on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, where we &s;aw a tree upon which &s;e|veral &s;hags had built their ne&s;ts, and here therefore we de|termined to dine; twenty of the &s;hags were &s;oon killed, and being broiled upon the &s;pot, afforded us an excellent meal. We then went upon the hills from whence I thought I &s;aw the head of the river. The &s;hore on each &s;ide, as well as the i&s;lands in the middle, were covered with mangroves; and the &s;and-banks abounded in cockles and clams: in many places there were rock oy&s;ters, and every where plenty of wild fowl, principally &s;hags, ducks, curlieus, and the &s;ea-pie, that has been de&s;cribed before. We al&s;o &s;aw fi&s;h in the river, but of what kind we could not di&s;cover: the country on the ea&s;t &s;ide of this river is for the mo&s;t part barren, and de&s;titute of wood; but on the we&s;t it has a better a&s;pect, and in &s;ome places is adorned with trees, but has in no part the appearance of cultivation. In the entrance of the river, and for two or three miles up, there is good anchoring in four and five fathom water, and places very convenient for lay|ing a ve&s;&s;el on &s;hore, where the tide ri&s;es and falls &s;even feet at the full and change of the moon. We could not deter|mine, whether any con&s;iderable &s;tream of fre&s;h water came into this river out of the country; but we &s;aw a number of &s;mall rivulets i&s;&s;ue from the adjacent hills. Near the mouth of this river, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, we found a little Indian village,

con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall temporary &s;heds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Friday 10.</NOTE> where we landed, and were received by the people with the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s and ho&s;pitality: they treated us with a flat &s;hell-fi&s;h of a mo&s;t de|licious ta&s;te, &s;omewhat like a cockle, which we eat hot from the coals. Near this place is a high point or penin&s;ula, pro|jecting into the river, and upon it are the remains of a fort, which they call <HI>Eppah</HI> or <HI>Heppah.</HI> The be&s;t engineer in Eu|rope could not have cho&s;en a &s;ituation better adapted to en|able a &s;mall number to defend them&s;elves again&s;t a greater. The &s;teepne&s;s of the cliffs renders it wholly inacce&s;&s;ible from the water which inclo&s;es it on three &s;ides; and, to the land, it is fortified by a ditch, and a bank rai&s;ed on the in&s;ide: from the top of the bank to the bottom of the ditch, is two and twenty feet; the ditch on the out&s;ide is fourteen feet deep, and its breadth is in proportion. The whole &s;eemed to have been executed with great judgment; and there had been a row of pickets or palli&s;adoes, both on the top of the bank and along the brink of the ditch on the out&s;ide; tho&s;e on the out&s;ide had been driven very deep into the ground, and were inclined towards the ditch, &s;o as to project over it; but of the&s;e the thicke&s;t po&s;ts only were left, and upon them there were evident marks of fire, &s;o that the place had pro|bably been taken and de&s;troyed by an enemy. If any oc|ca&s;ion &s;hould make it nece&s;&s;ary for a &s;hip to winter here, or &s;tay any time, tents might be built in this place, which is &s;ufficiently &s;pacious, with great convenience, and might ea&s;ily be made impregnable to the whole country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 11.</NOTE>On the eleventh, there was &s;o much wind and rain that no canoe came off; but the long-boat was &s;ent to fetch oy&s;|ters from one of the beds which had been di&s;covered the day before: the boat &s;oon returned, deeply laden, and the oy&s;ters, which were as good as ever came from Colche&s;ter, and about the &s;ame &s;ize, were laid down under the booms, and the

Saturday 11.</NOTE> as may rea&s;onably be &s;up|po&s;ed, great part of them were expended; this, however, gave us no concern, as we knew that not the boat only, but the &s;hip, might have been loaded, almo&s;t in one tide, as the beds are dry at half ebb.</P>
<P>In the morning of Sunday the 12th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 12.</NOTE> two canoes came off full of people whom we had never &s;een before, but who ap|peared to have heard of us by the caution which they u&s;ed in approaching us. As we invited them to come along&s;ide with all the tokens of friend&s;hip that we could &s;hew, they ventured up, and two of them came on board; the re&s;t traded very fairly for what they had: a &s;mall canoe al&s;o came from the other &s;ide of the bay, and &s;old us &s;ome very large fi&s;h, which they gave us to under&s;tand they would have brought ye&s;terday, having caught them the day before, but that the wind was &s;o high they could not venture to &s;ea.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, I went with the pinnace and yawl, accom|panied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, over to the north &s;ide of the bay, to take a view of the country, and two fortified villages which we had di&s;covered at a di&s;tance. We landed near the &s;malle&s;t of them, the &s;ituation of which was the mo&s;t beautifully romantic that can be imagined; it was built upon a &s;mall rock, detached from the main, and &s;urrounded at high water. The whole body of this rock was perforated by an hollow or arch, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much the large&s;t part of it; the top of the arch was above &s;ixty feet perpendicular above the &s;ea, which at high water flowed through the bot|tom of it: the whole &s;ummit of the rock above the arch was fenced round after their manner; but the area was not large enough to contain more than five or &s;ix hou&s;es: it was acce&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="342" REF="380">
only by one very narrow and &s;teep path,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Sunday 12.</NOTE> by which the inhabitants, at our approach, came down, and invited us into the place; but we refu&s;ed, intending to vi&s;it a much more con&s;iderable fort of the &s;ame kind at about a mile's di&s;tance. We made &s;ome pre&s;ents however to the women, and in the mean time we &s;aw the inhabitants of the town which we were going to, coming towards us in a body, men, women, and children, to the number of about one hundred: when they came near enough to be heard, they waved their hands and called out <HI>Horomai</HI>; after which they &s;at down among the bu&s;hes near the beach: the&s;e ceremonies we were told were certain &s;igns of their friendly di&s;po&s;ition. We advanced to the place where they were &s;itting, and when we came up, made them a few pre&s;ents, and a&s;ked leave to vi&s;it their Heppah; they con&s;ented with joy in their countenances, and immediately led the way. It is called WHARRETOUWA, and is &s;ituated upon a high promontory or point, which projects into the &s;ea, on the north &s;ide, and near the head of the bay: two &s;ides of it are wa&s;hed by the &s;ea, and the&s;e are altogether inacce&s;&s;ible; two other &s;ides are to the land: up one of them, which is very &s;teep, lies the avenue from the beach; the other is flat and open to the country upon the hill, which is a narrow ridge: the whole is inclo&s;ed by a palli&s;ade about ten feet high, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;trong pales bound together with withes. The weak &s;ide next the land is al&s;o defended by a double ditch, the innermo&s;t of which has a bank and an ad|ditional palli&s;ade; the inner palli&s;ades are upon the bank next the town, but at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the top of the bank as to leave room for men to walk and u&s;e their arms, between them and the inner ditch: the outermo&s;t palli&s;ades are between the two ditches, and driven obliquely into the ground, &s;o that their upper ends incline over the in|ner ditch: the depth of this ditch, from the bottom to
<PB N="343" REF="381">
the top or crown of the bank, is four and twenty feet.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Sunday 12.</NOTE> Clo&s;e within the innermo&s;t palli&s;ade is a &s;tage, twenty feet high, forty feet long, and &s;ix broad; it is &s;upported by &s;trong po&s;ts, and is intended as a &s;tation for tho&s;e who defend the place, from which they may annoy the a&s;|&s;ailants by darts and &s;tones, heaps of which lay ready for u&s;e. Another &s;tage of the &s;ame kind commands the &s;teep avenue from the beach, and &s;tands al&s;o within the palli&s;ade; on this &s;ide of the hill there are &s;ome little outworks and huts, not intended as advanced po&s;ts, but as the habitations of people who for want of room could not be accommodated within the works, but who were, notwith&s;tanding, de&s;irous of placing them&s;elves under their protection. The palli&s;ades, as has been ob&s;erved already, run round the whole brow of the hill, as well towards the &s;ea as towards the land; but the ground within having originally been a mount, they have reduced it not to one level, but to &s;everal, ri&s;ing in &s;tages one above the other, like an amphitheatre, each of which is inclo&s;ed within its &s;eparate palli&s;ade; they com|municate with each other by narrow lanes, which might ea&s;ily be &s;topped up, &s;o that if an enemy &s;hould force the outward palli&s;ade, he would have others to carry before the place could be wholly reduced, &s;uppo&s;ing the&s;e places to be ob&s;tinately defended one after the other. The only entrance is by a narrow pa&s;&s;age, about twelve feet long, communi|cating with the &s;teep a&s;cent from the beach: it pa&s;&s;es under one of the fighting &s;tages, and though we &s;aw nothing like a door or gateway, it may be ea&s;ily barricaded in a manner that will make the forcing it a very dangerous and difficult undertaking. Upon the whole, this mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a place of great &s;trength, in which a &s;mall number of re&s;olute men may defend them&s;elves again&s;t all the force which a people with no other arms than tho&s;e that are in u&s;e here
<PB N="344" REF="382">
could bring again&s;t it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Sunday 12.</NOTE> It &s;eemed to be well furni&s;hed for a &s;iege with every thing but water; we &s;aw great quantities of fern root, which they eat as bread, and dried fi&s;h piled up in heaps; but we could not perceive that they had any fre&s;h water nearer than a brook, which runs clo&s;e under the foot of the hill: whether they have any means of getting it from this place during a &s;iege, or whether they have any method of &s;toring it within the works in gourds or other ve&s;&s;els, we could not learn; &s;ome re&s;ource they certainly have with re&s;pect to this article, an indi&s;pen&s;able nece&s;&s;ary of life, for otherwi&s;e the laying up dry provi&s;ions could an&s;wer no pur|po&s;e. Upon our expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to &s;ee their method of attack and defence, one of the young men mounted a fight|ing &s;tage, which they call <HI>Porava,</HI> and another went into the ditch: both he that was to defend the place, and he that was to a&s;&s;ault it, &s;ung the war-&s;ong, and danced with the &s;ame frightful ge&s;ticulations that we had &s;een u&s;ed in more &s;erious circum&s;tances, to work them&s;elves up into a degree of that mechanical fury, which, among all uncivilized nations, is the nece&s;&s;ary prelude to a battle; for di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate courage, a &s;trength of mind that can &s;urmount the &s;en&s;e of danger, without a flow of animal &s;pirits by which it is extingui&s;hed, &s;eems to be the prerogative of tho&s;e who have projects of more la&s;ting importance, and a keener &s;en&s;e of honour and di&s;grace, than can be formed or felt by men who have few pains or plea&s;ures be&s;ides tho&s;e of mere animal life, and &s;carcely any purpo&s;e but to provide for the day that is pa&s;&s;ing over them, to obtain plunder, or revenge an in&s;ult: they will march again&s;t each other indeed in cool blood, though they find it nece&s;&s;ary to work them&s;elves into pa&s;&s;ion before they engage; as among us there have been many in&s;tances of people who have deliberately made them&s;elves drunk, that they might execute a project which they formed when
<PB N="345" REF="383">
they were &s;ober, but which, while they continued &s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Sunday 12.</NOTE> they did not dare to undertake.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of the hill, near this inclo&s;ure, we &s;aw about half an acre planted with gourds and &s;weet potatoes, which was the only cultivation in the bay: under the foot of the point upon which this fortification &s;tands, are two rocks, one ju&s;t broken off from the main, and the other not perfectly de|tached from it: they are both &s;mall, and &s;eem more proper for the habitations of birds than men; yet there are hou&s;es and places of defence upon each of them. And we &s;aw many other works of the &s;ame kind upon &s;mall i&s;lands, rocks, and ridges of hills, on different parts of the coa&s;t, be|&s;ides many fortified towns, which appeared to be much &s;upe|rior to this.</P>
<P>The perpetual ho&s;tility in which the&s;e poor &s;avages, who have made every village a fort, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily live, will account for there being &s;o little of their land in a &s;tate of cultivation; and, as mi&s;chiefs very often reciprocally pro|duce each other, it may perhaps appear, that there being &s;o little land in a &s;tate of cultivation, will account for their living in perpetual ho&s;tility. But it is very &s;trange, that the &s;ame invention and diligence which have been u&s;ed in the con|&s;truction of places &s;o admirably adapted to defence, almo&s;t without tools, &s;hould not, when urged by the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity, have furni&s;hed them with a &s;ingle mi&s;&s;ile weapon except the lance, which is thrown by hand: they have no contrivance like a bow to di&s;charge a dart, nor any thing like a &s;ling to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in throwing a &s;tone; which is the more &s;urpri&s;|ing, as the invention of &s;lings, and bows and arrows, is much more obvious than of the works which the&s;e people con|&s;truct, and both the&s;e weapons are found among much ruder nations, and in almo&s;t every other part of the world. Be&s;ides

They have al&s;o another weapon, about a foot &s;horter than the&s;e, pointed at one end, and at the other &s;haped like an axe. The points of their long lances are barbed, and they handle them with &s;uch &s;trength and agility, that we can match them with no weapon but a loaded mu&s;quet.</P>
<P>After taking a &s;light view of the country, and loading both the boats with celery, which we found in great plenty near the beach, we returned from our excur&s;ion, and about five o'clock in the evening got on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 15.</NOTE>On the 15th, I &s;ailed out of the bay, and at the &s;ame time had &s;everal canoes on board, in one of which was our friend Toiava, who &s;aid, that as &s;oon as we were gone he mu&s;t re|pair to his Heppah or fort, becau&s;e the friends of the man who had been &s;hot by Mr. Gore on the 9th, had threatened to revenge his death upon him, whom they had reproached as being our friend. Off the north point of the bay, I &s;aw a great number of i&s;lands, of various extent, which lay &s;cat|tered to the north we&s;t, in a direction parallel with the main as far as I could &s;ee. I &s;teered north ea&s;t for the north ea&s;t|ermo&s;t of the&s;e i&s;lands; but the wind coming to the north we&s;t, I was obliged to &s;tand out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>To the bay which we had now left I gave the name of MERCURY BAY, on account of the ob&s;ervation which we had made there of the tran&s;it of that planet over the &s;un. It lies in latitude 36&deg; 47&prime; S.; and in the longitude of 184&deg; 4&prime; W.: there are &s;everal i&s;lands lying both to the &s;outhward and northward of it, and a &s;mall i&s;land or rock in the middle of
<PB N="347" REF="385">
the entrance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s;. 15.</NOTE> within this i&s;land the depth of water no where exceeds nine fathom: the be&s;t anchoring is in a &s;andy bay, which lies ju&s;t within the &s;outh head, in five and four fa|thom, bringing a high tower or rock, which lies without the head, in one with the head, or ju&s;t &s;hut in behind it. This place is very convenient both for wooding and watering, and in the river there is an immen&s;e quantity of oy&s;ters and other &s;hell-fi&s;h: I have for this rea&s;on given it the name of OYSTER RIVER. But for a &s;hip that wants to &s;tay here any time, the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t place is in the river at the head of the bay; which, from the number of mangrove trees about it, I have called MANGROVE RIVER. To &s;ail into this river, the &s;outh &s;hore mu&s;t be kept all the way on board. The country on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river and bay is very barren, its only produce being fern, and a few other plants that will grow in a poor &s;oil. The land on the north we&s;t &s;ide is covered with wood, and the &s;oil being much more fertile, would doubtle&s;s produce all the nece&s;&s;aries of life with pro|per cultivation: it is not however &s;o fertile as the lands that we have &s;een to the &s;outhward; nor do the inhabitants, though numerous, make &s;o good an appearance: they have no plantations; their canoes are mean, and without orna|ment; they &s;leep in the open air; and &s;ay, that Teratu, who&s;e &s;overeignty they do not acknowledge, if he was to come among them, would kill them. This favoured our opinion of their being outlaws; yet they told us, that they had Heppahs or &s;trong holds, to which they retired in time of imminent danger.</P>
<P>We found, thrown upon the &s;hore, in &s;everal parts of this bay, great quantities of iron-&s;and, which is brought down by every little rivulet of fre&s;h water that finds its way from the country; which is a demon&s;tration that there is ore of
<PB N="348" REF="386">
that metal not far inland:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s;. 15.</NOTE> yet neither the inhabitants of this place, or any other part of the coa&s;t that we have &s;een, know the u&s;e of iron, or &s;et the lea&s;t value upon it; all of them preferring the mo&s;t worthle&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s trifle, not only to a nail, but to any tool of that metal.</P>
<P>Before we left the bay, we cut upon one of the trees near the watering-place the &s;hip's name, and that of the Com|mander, with the date of the year and month when we were there; and, after di&s;playing the Engli&s;h colours, I took a formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the name of his Britannic Maje&s;ty King George the Third.</P>

Saturday 18.</NOTE> went to the poop, and began to expo&s;tu|late: he told them, that we had weapons which would de|&s;troy them in a moment; and that, if they ventured to at|tack us, we &s;hould be obliged to u&s;e them. Upon this, they flouri&s;hed their weapons, and cried out, in their language, "Come on &s;hore, and we will kill you all:" Well, &s;aid Tu|pia, but why &s;hould you mole&s;t us while we are at &s;ea? as we do not wi&s;h to fight, we &s;hall not accept your challenge to come on &s;hore; and here there is no pretence for a quar|rel, the &s;ea being no more your property than the &s;hip. This eloquence of Tupia, though it greatly &s;urpri&s;ed us, having given him no hints for the arguments he u&s;ed, had no effect upon our enemies, who very &s;oon renewed their battery: a mu&s;quet was then fired through one of their boats, and this was an argument of &s;ufficient weight, for they immediately fell a&s;tern and left us.</P>
<P>From the point, of which we were now abrea&s;t, the land trends W. &frac12; S. near a league, and then S. S. E. as far as we could &s;ee; and, be&s;ides the i&s;lands that lay without us, we could &s;ee land round by the S. W. as far as the N. W.; but whether this was the main or i&s;lands, we could not then de|termine: the fear of lo&s;ing the main, however, made me re|&s;olve to follow its direction. With this view, I hauled round the point and &s;teered to the &s;outhward, but there being light airs all round the compa&s;s, we made but little progre&s;s.</P>
<P>About one o'clock, a breeze &s;prung up at ea&s;t, which after|wards came to N. E. and we &s;teered along the &s;hore S. by E. and S. S. E. having from twenty-five to eighteen fathom.</P>
<P>At about half an hour after &s;even in the evening, having run &s;even or eight leagues &s;ince noon, I anchored in twenty-three fathom, not chu&s;ing to run any farther in the dark, as I had now land on both &s;ides, forming the entrance of a
<PB N="351" REF="389">
&s;treight, bay, or river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November.</NOTE> lying S. by E. for on that point we could &s;ee no land.</P>
<P>At day-break, on the 19th, the wind being &s;till favourable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 19.</NOTE> we weighed and &s;tood with an ea&s;y &s;ail up the inlet, keeping neare&s;t to the ea&s;t &s;ide. In a &s;hort time, two large canoes came off to us from the &s;hore; the people on board &s;aid, that they knew Toiava very well, and called Tupia by his name. I invited &s;ome of them on board; and as they knew they had nothing to fear from us, while they behaved hone&s;tly and peaceably, they immediately complied: I made each of them &s;ome pre&s;ents, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them much gratified. Other canoes afterwards came up to us from a different &s;ide of the bay; and the people on board of the&s;e al&s;o mentioned the name of Toiava, and &s;ent a young man into the &s;hip, who told us he was his grand&s;on, and he al&s;o was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>After having run about five leagues from the place where we had anchored the night before, our depth of water gra|dually decrea&s;ed to &s;ix fathom; and not chu&s;ing to go into le&s;s, as it was tide of flood, and the wind blew right up the inlet, I came to an anchor about the middle of the channel, which is near eleven miles over; after which I &s;ent two boats out to &s;ound, one on one &s;ide, and the other on the other.</P>
<P>The boats not having found above three feet more water than we were now in, I determined to go no farther with the &s;hip, but to examine the head of the bay in the boats; for, as it appeared to run a good way inland, I thought this a favourable opportunity to examine the interior part of the country, and its produce.</P>
<P>At day-break, therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 20.</NOTE> I &s;et out in the pinnace and long|boat, accompanied by Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and Tupia;
<PB N="352" REF="390">
and we found the inlet end in a river,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Monday 20.</NOTE> about nine miles above the &s;hip: into this river we entered with the fir&s;t of the flood, and within three miles found the water perfectly fre&s;h. Before we had proceeded more than one third of that di&s;|tance, we found an Indian town, which was built upon a a &s;mall bank of dry &s;and, but intirely &s;urrounded by a deep mud, which po&s;&s;ibly the inhabitants might con&s;ider as a de|fence. The&s;e people, as &s;oon as they &s;aw us, thronged to the banks, and invited us on &s;hore. We accepted the invi|tation, and made them a vi&s;it notwith&s;tanding the mud. They received us with open arms, having heard of us from our good old friend Toiava; but our &s;tay could not be long, as we had other objects of curio&s;ity in view. We proceeded up the river till near noon, when we were fourteen miles with|in its entrance; and then, finding the face of the country to continue nearly the &s;ame, without any alteration in the cour&s;e of the &s;tream, which we had no hope of tracing to its &s;ource, we landed on the we&s;t &s;ide, to take a view of the lofty trees which every where adorned its banks. They were of a kind that we had &s;een before, though only at a di&s;tance, both in Poverty Bay and Hawke's Bay. Before we had walked an hundred yards into the wood, we met with one of them which was nineteen feet eight inches in the girt, at the height of &s;ix feet above the ground: having a quadrant with me, I mea&s;ured its height from the root to the fir&s;t branch, and found it to be eighty-nine feet: it was as &s;trait as an ar|row, and tapered but very little in proportion to its height; &s;o that I judged there were three hundred and fifty-&s;ix feet of &s;olid timber in it, exclu&s;ive of the branches. As we ad|vanced, we &s;aw many others that were &s;till larger; we cut down a young one, and the wood proved heavy and &s;olid, not fit for ma&s;ts, but &s;uch as would make the fine&s;t plank in the world. Our carpenter, who was with us, &s;aid that the
<PB N="353" REF="391">
timber re&s;embled that of the pitch-pine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Monday 20.</NOTE> which is lightened by tapping; and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome &s;uch method might be found to lighten the&s;e, and they would then be &s;uch ma&s;ts as no country in Europe can produce. As the wood was &s;wampy, we could not range far; but we found many &s;tout trees of other kinds, all of them utterly unknown to us, &s;pecimens of which we brought away.</P>
<P>The river at this height is as broad as the Thames at Greenwich, and the tide of flood as &s;trong; it is not indeed quite &s;o deep, but has water enough for ve&s;&s;els of more than a middle &s;ize, and a bottom of mud, &s;o &s;oft that nothing could take damage by running a&s;hore.</P>
<P>About three o'clock, we reimbarked, in order to return with the fir&s;t of the ebb, and named the river the THAMES, it having &s;ome re&s;emblance to our own river of that name. In our return, the inhabitants of the village where we had been a&s;hore, &s;eeing us take another channel, came off to us in their canoes, and trafficked with us in the mo&s;t friendly manner, till they had di&s;po&s;ed of the few trifles they had. The tide of ebb ju&s;t carried us out of the narrow part of the river, into the channel that run up from the &s;ea, before it was dark; and we pulled hard to reach the &s;hip, but meet|ing the flood, and a &s;trong breeze at N. N. W. with &s;howers of rain, we were obliged to de&s;i&s;t; and about midnight, we run under the land, and came to a grappling, where we took &s;uch re&s;t as our &s;ituation would admit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 21.</NOTE> At break of day, we &s;et forward again, and it was pa&s;t &s;even o'clock be|fore we reached the &s;hip. We were all extremely tired, but thought our&s;elves happy to be on board; for before nine it blew &s;o hard that the boat could not have rowed ahead, and mu&s;t therefore either have gone a&s;hore, or taken &s;helter under it.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="392"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Tue&s;day 21.</NOTE>About three o'clock, having the tide of ebb, we took up our anchor, made &s;ail, and plied down the river till eight in the evening, when we came to an anchor again: early in the morning we made &s;ail with the fir&s;t ebb,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 22.</NOTE> and kept plying till the flood obliged us once more to come to an anchor. As we had now only a light breeze, I went in the pinnace, ac|companied by Dr. Solander, to the we&s;tern &s;hore; but I &s;aw nothing worthy of notice.</P>
<P>When I left the &s;hip, many canoes were about it; Mr. Banks therefore cho&s;e to &s;tay on board, and traffic with the natives: they bartered their clothes and arms, chiefly for paper, and behaved with great friend&s;hip and hone&s;ty. But while &s;ome of them were below with Mr. Banks, a young man who was upon the deck &s;tole a half minute gla&s;s which was in the binacle, and was detected ju&s;t as he was carrying it off. Mr. Hicks, who was commanding officer on board, took it into his head to puni&s;h him, by giving him twelve la&s;hes with a cat-o'nine-tails; and accordingly ordered him to be taken to the gang-way, and tied up to the &s;hrouds. When the other Indians who were on board &s;aw him &s;eized, they attempted to re&s;cue him; and being re&s;i&s;ted, called for their arms, which were handed up from the canoes, and the peo|ple of one of them attempted to come up the &s;hip's &s;ide. The tumult was heard by Mr. Banks, who, with Tupia, came ha&s;tily upon the deck to &s;ee what had happened. The In|dians immediately ran to Tupia, who, finding Mr. Hicks in|exorable, could only a&s;&s;ure them, that nothing was intended again&s;t the life of their companion; but that it was nece&s;|&s;ary he &s;hould &s;uffer &s;ome puni&s;hment for his offence, which being explained to them, they &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied. The puni&s;hment was then inflicted, and as &s;oon as the criminal was unbound, an old man among the &s;pectators, who was
<PB N="355" REF="393">
&s;uppo&s;ed to be his father, gave him a hearty beating,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s; 22.</NOTE> and &s;ent him down into his canoe. All the canoes then dropped a-&s;tern, and the people &s;aid that they were afraid to come any more near the &s;hip: after much per&s;ua&s;ion, however, they ventured back again, but their cheerful confidence was at an end, and their &s;tay was &s;hort; they promi&s;ed indeed, at their departure, to return with &s;ome fi&s;h, but we &s;aw no more of them.</P>
<P>On the 23d, the wind being contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 23.</NOTE> we kept plying down the river, and at &s;even in the evening, got without the N. W. point of the i&s;lands lying on the we&s;t &s;ide of it. The weather being bad, night coming on, and having land on every &s;ide of us, I thought it mo&s;t advi&s;able to tack, and &s;tretch in under the point, where we anchored in nineteen fathom. At five in the morning, of the 24th, we weighed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 24.</NOTE> and made &s;ail to the N. W. under our cour&s;es and double reefed top-&s;ails, the wind being at S. W. by W. and W. S. W. a &s;trong gale and &s;qually. As the gale would not permit us to come near the land, we had but a &s;light and di&s;tant view of it from the time when we got under &s;ail till noon, during a run of twelve leagues, but we never once lo&s;t &s;ight of it. At this time, our latitude, by ob&s;ervation, was 36&deg; 15&prime; 20&Prime;, we were not above two miles from a point of land on the main, and three leagues and an half from a very high i&s;land, which bore N. E. by E.: in this &s;ituation we had twenty-&s;ix fathom water: the farthe&s;t point on the main that we could &s;ee bore N. W. but we could perceive &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands lying to the north of that direction. The point of land of which we were now a-brea&s;t, and which I called POINT RODNEY, is the N. W. extremity of the river Thames; for under that name I comprehend the deep bay which termi|nates in the fre&s;h water &s;tream, and the N. E. extremity is the promontory which we pa&s;&s;ed when we entered it, and
<PB N="356" REF="394">
which I called CAPE COLVILLE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Friday 24.</NOTE> in honour of the Right Ho|nourable Lord Colville.</P>
<P>Cape Colville lies in latitude 36&deg; 26&prime;, longitude 194&deg; 27&prime;; it ri&s;es directly from the &s;ea to a con&s;iderable height, and is remarkable for a lofty rock, which &s;tands to the pitch of the point, and may be di&s;tingui&s;hed at a very great di&s;tance. From the &s;outh point of this Cape the river runs in a direct line S. by E. and is no where le&s;s than three leagues broad for the di&s;tance of fourteen leagues above the Cape, and there it is contracted to a narrow &s;tream, but continues the &s;ame cour&s;e through a low flat country, or broad valley, which lies parallel with the &s;ea coa&s;t, and the end of which we could not &s;ee. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the broad part of this river the land is tolerably high and hilly; on the we&s;t &s;ide it is rather low, but the whole is covered with verdure and wood, and has the appearance of great fertility, though there were but a few &s;mall &s;pots which had been cultivated. At the entrance of the narrow part of the river the land is covered with mangroves and other &s;hrubs; but farther, there are immen&s;e woods of perhaps the fine&s;t timber in the world, of which &s;ome account has already been given: in &s;everal places the wood extends to the very edge of the water, and where it is at a little di&s;tance, the intermediate &s;pace is mar&s;hy, like &s;ome parts of the banks of the Thames in England: it is probable that the river contains plenty of fi&s;h, for we &s;aw poles &s;tuck up in many places to &s;et nets for catching them, but of what kinds I do not know. The greate&s;t depth of water that we found in this river was &s;ix and twenty fathom, which gradually decrea&s;ed to one fathom and an half: in the mouth of the fre&s;h water &s;tream it is from four to three fathom, but there are large flats and &s;and banks lying before it. A &s;hip of moderate draught may, notwith&s;tanding, go a long way up this river with a flowing
<PB N="357" REF="395">
tide, for it ri&s;es perpendicularly near ten feet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Friday 24.</NOTE> and at the full and change of the moon, it is high water about nine o'clock.</P>
<P>Six leagues within Cape Colville, under the ea&s;tern &s;hore, are &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands, which, together with the main, &s;eem to form good harbours; and oppo&s;ite to the&s;e i&s;lands, under the we&s;tern &s;hore, lie other i&s;lands, by which it is al&s;o pro|bable that good harbours may be formed: but if there are no harbours about this river, there is good anchoring in every part of it where the depth of water is &s;ufficient, for it is defended from the &s;ea by a chain of i&s;lands of different ex|tent, which lie cro&s;s the mouth of it, and which I have, for that rea&s;on, called BARRIER ISLANDS: they &s;tretch N. W. and S. E. ten leagues. The &s;outh end of the chain lies N. E. be|tween two and three leagues from Cape Colville; and the north end lies N. E. four leagues and an half from Point Rodney. Point Rodney lies W. N. W. nine leagues from Cape Colville, in latitude 36&deg; 15&prime; S. longitude 184&deg; 53&prime; W.</P>
<P>The natives re&s;iding about this river do not appear to be numerous, con&s;idering the great extent of the country. But they are a &s;trong, well-made, and active people, and all of them paint their bodies with red oker and oil from head to foot, which we had not &s;een before. Their canoes were large and well built, and adorned with carving, in as good a ta&s;te as any that we had &s;een upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>We continued to &s;tand along the &s;hore till night, with the main land on one &s;ide, and i&s;lands on the other, and then anchored in a bay, with fourteen fathom and a &s;andy bottom. We had no &s;ooner come to an anchor, than we tried our lines, and in a &s;hort time caught near one hundred fi&s;h, which the people called Sea-bream; they weighed from &s;ix to eight pounds a piece, and con&s;equently would &s;upply the whole &s;hip's company with food for two days. From the
<PB N="358" REF="396">
&s;ucce&s;s of our lines here, we called the place BREAM BAY:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Friday 24.</NOTE> the two points that form it lie north and &s;outh, five leagues from each other; it is every where of a good breadth, and between three and four leagues deep: at the bottom of it there appears to be a river of fre&s;h water. The north head of the bay, called BREAM HEAD, is high land, and remark|able for &s;everal pointed rocks, which &s;tand in a range upon the top of it: it may al&s;o be known by &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands which lie before it, called the HEN AND CHICKENS, one of which is high, and terminates in two peaks. It lies in lati|tude 35&deg; 46&prime; S., and at the di&s;tance of &s;eventeen leagues and an half from Cape Colville, in the direction of N. 41 W.</P>
<P>The land between Point Rodney and Bream Head, an ex|tent of ten leagues, is low, and wooded in tufts, with white &s;and banks between the &s;ea and the firm land. We &s;aw no inhabitants, but many fires in the night; and where there are fires, there are always people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 25.</NOTE>At day-break, on the 25th, we left the bay, and &s;teered along &s;hore to the northward: we found the variation of the compa&s;s to be 12&deg; 42&prime; E. At noon, our latitude was 36&deg; 36&prime; S., Bream Head bore &s;outh, di&s;tant ten miles; and we &s;aw &s;ome &s;mall i&s;lands, to which I gave the name of the POOR KNIGHTS, at N. E. by N. di&s;tant three leagues; the norther|mo&s;t land in &s;ight bore N. N. W.: we were in this place at the di&s;tance of two miles from the &s;hore, and had twenty-&s;ix fa|thom water.</P>
<P>The country appeared low, but well covered with wood: we &s;aw &s;ome &s;traggling hou&s;es, three or four fortified towns, and near them a large quantity of cultivated land.</P>
<P>In the evening, &s;even large canoes came off to us, with about two hundred men: &s;ome of them came on board, and &s;aid that they had heard of us. To two of them, who ap|peared
<PB N="359" REF="397">
to be Chiefs, I gave pre&s;ents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Saturday 25.</NOTE> but when the&s;e were gone out of the &s;hip, the others became exceedingly trouble|&s;ome. Some of tho&s;e in the canoes began to trade, and, ac|cording to their cu&s;tom, to cheat, by refu&s;ing to deliver what had been bought, after they had received the price: among the&s;e was one who had received an old pair of black breeches, which, upon a few &s;mall &s;hot being fired at him, he threw into the &s;ea. All the boats &s;oon after paddled off to &s;ome di&s;tance, and when they thought they were out of reach, they began to defy us, by &s;inging their &s;ong and brandi&s;hing their weapons. We thought it advi&s;able to in|timidate them, as well for their &s;akes as our own, and therefore fired fir&s;t &s;ome &s;mall arms, and then round &s;hot over their heads; the la&s;t put them in a terrible fright, though they received no damage, except by over-heating them&s;elves in paddling away, which they did with a&s;toni&s;h|ing expedition.</P>
<P>In the night we had variable light airs;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 26.</NOTE> but towards the morning a breeze &s;prung up at S. and afterwards at S. E. with which we proceeded &s;lowly to the northward, along the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Between &s;ix and &s;even o'clock two canoes came off, and told us that they had heard of ye&s;terday's adventure, not|with&s;tanding which the people came on board, and traded very quietly and hone&s;tly for whatever they had: &s;oon after two canoes came off from a more di&s;tant part of the &s;hore; the&s;e were of a much larger &s;ize, and full of people: when they came near, they called off the other canoes which were along &s;ide of the &s;hip, and after a &s;hort conference they all came up together. The &s;trangers appeared to be per&s;ons of a &s;uperior rank; their canoes were well carved with many ornaments, and they had with them a great variety of wea|pons:
<PB N="360" REF="398">
they had patoo-patoos both of &s;tone and whalebone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Sunday 26.</NOTE> upon which they appeared to &s;et a great value; they had al&s;o ribs of whale, of which we had before &s;een imitations in wood, carved and adorned with tufts of dog's hair. Their complexions were browner than tho&s;e of the people we had &s;een to the &s;outhward, and their bodies and faces were more marked with the black &s;tains which they call Amoco: they had a broad &s;piral on each buttock; and the thighs of many of them were almo&s;t intirely black, &s;ome narrow lines only being left untouched, &s;o that at fir&s;t &s;ight they appeared to wear &s;triped breeches. With re&s;pect to the Amoco, every different tribe &s;eemed to have a different cu&s;tom, for all the men, in &s;ome canoes, &s;eemed to be almo&s;t covered with it, and tho&s;e in others had &s;carcely a &s;tain, except on the lips, which were black in all of them without a &s;ingle exception. The&s;e gentlemen, for a long time, refu&s;ed to part with any of their weapons, whatever was offered for them; at la&s;t, however, one of them produced a piece of talc, wrought into the &s;hape of an ax, and agreed to &s;ell it for a piece of cloth: the cloth was handed over the &s;hip's &s;ide, but his ho|nour immediately put off his canoe with the ax. We had recour&s;e to our u&s;ual expedient, and fired a mu&s;ket ball over the canoe, upon which it put back to the &s;hip, and the piece of cloth was returned; all the boats then went a&s;hore, without offering any further intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>At noon, the main land extended from S. by E. to N. W. by W. a remarkable point of land bearing W. di&s;tant four or five miles; at three we pa&s;&s;ed it, and I gave it the name of CAPE BRET, in honour of Sir Piercy. The land of this Cape is con&s;iderably higher than any part of the adjacent coa&s;t: at the point of it, is a high round hillock, and N. E. by N. at the di&s;tance of about a mile, is a &s;mall high i&s;land or rock, which, like &s;everal that have already been de&s;cribed, was
<PB N="361" REF="399">
perforated quite through,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Sunday 26.</NOTE> &s;o as to appear like the arch of a bridge. This Cape, or at lea&s;t &s;ome part of it, is by the na|tives called MOTUGOGOGO, and it lies in latitude 35&deg; 10&prime; 30&Prime; S. longitude 185&deg; 25&prime; W. On the we&s;t &s;ide of it is a large and pretty deep bay, lying in S. W. by W. in which there appeared to be &s;everal &s;mall i&s;lands: the point that forms the N. W. entrance, lies W. &frac14; N. at the di&s;tance of three or four leagues from Cape Bret, and I di&s;tingui&s;hed it by the name of POINT POCOCKE. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the bay we &s;aw &s;everal vil|lages, both upon i&s;lands and the main, and &s;everal very large canoes came off to us, full of people, who made a better ap|pearance than any we had &s;een yet: they were all &s;tout and well-made; their hair, which was black, was tied up in a bunch on the crown of their heads, and &s;tuck with white feathers. In each of the canoes were two or three Chiefs, who&s;e habits were of the be&s;t &s;ort of cloth, and covered with dog's &s;kin, &s;o as to make an agreeable appearance: mo&s;t of the&s;e people were marked with the Amoco, like tho&s;e who had been along&s;ide of us before: their manner of trading was al&s;o equally fraudulent; and the officers neglecting either to puni&s;h or fright them, one of the mid&s;hipmen who had been defrauded in his bargain, had recour&s;e, for re|venge, to an expedient which was equally ludicrous and &s;evere: he got a fi&s;hing line, and when the man who had cheated him was clo&s;e under the &s;hip's &s;ide in his canoe, he heaved the lead with &s;o good an aim that the hook caught him by the back&s;ide; he then pulled the line, and the man holding back, the hook broke in the &s;hank, and the beard was left &s;ticking in the fle&s;h.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of this day, though we did not range more than &s;ix or eight leagues of the coa&s;t, we had along|&s;ide and on board the &s;hip between four and five hundred of
<PB N="362" REF="400">
the natives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November.</NOTE> which is a proof that this part of the country is well inhabited.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 27.</NOTE>At eight o'clock the next morning, we were within a mile of a group of i&s;lands which lie clo&s;e under the main, at the di&s;tance of two and twenty miles from Cape Bret, in the di|rection of N. W. by W. &frac12; W. At this place, having but little wind, we lay about two hours, during which time &s;everal canoes came off, and &s;old us &s;ome fi&s;h, which we called Ca|valles, and for that rea&s;on I gave the &s;ame name to the i&s;lands. The&s;e people were very in&s;olent, frequently threat|ening us, even while they were &s;elling their fi&s;h; and when &s;ome more canoes came up, they began to pelt us with &s;tones. Some &s;mall &s;hot were then fired, and hit one of them while he had a &s;tone in his hand, in the very action of throw|ing it into the &s;hip: they did not, however, de&s;i&s;t, till &s;ome others had been wounded, and then they went away, and we &s;tood off to &s;ea.</P>
<P>The wind being directly again&s;t us, we kept plying to windward till the 29th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 29.</NOTE> when we had rather lo&s;t than gained ground; I therefore bore up for a bay which lies to the we&s;t|ward of Cape Bret; at this time it was about two leagues to leeward of us; and at about eleven o'clock we anchored under the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of one of the many i&s;lands which line it on the &s;outh ea&s;t, in four fathom and an half water; we &s;hoaled our water to this depth all at once, and if this had not happened I &s;hould not have come to an anchor &s;o &s;oon. The Ma&s;ter was immediately &s;ent out with two boats to &s;ound, and he &s;oon di&s;covered that we had got upon a bank, which runs out from the north we&s;t end of the i&s;land, and that on the out&s;ide of it there was from eight to ten fathom.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="401">In the mean time the natives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s;. 29.</NOTE> to the number of near four hundred, crouded upon us in their canoes, and &s;ome of them were admitted on board: to one, who &s;eemed to be a Chief, I gave a piece of broad cloth, and di&s;tributed &s;ome trifling pre&s;ents among the re&s;t. I perceived that &s;ome of the&s;e people had been about the &s;hip when &s;he was off at &s;ea, and that they knew the power of our fire-arms, for the very &s;ight of a gun threw them into manife&s;t confu&s;ion: under this impre&s;&s;ion they traded very fairly; but the people in one of the canoes took the opportunity of our being at dinner to tow away our buoy: a mu&s;ket was fired over them without effect, we then endeavoured to reach them with &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot, but they were too far off: by this time they had got the buoy into their canoe, and we were obliged to fire a mu&s;ket at them with ball: this hit one of them, and they immedi|ately threw the buoy over board: a round &s;hot was then fired over them, which &s;truck the water and went a&s;hore. Two or three of the canoes immediately landed their people, who ran about the beach, as we imagined, in &s;earch of the ball. Tupia called to them, and a&s;&s;ured them that while they were hone&s;t they &s;hould be &s;afe, and with a little per&s;ua&s;ion many of them returned to the &s;hip, and their behaviour was &s;uch as left us no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that they intended to give us any farther trouble.</P>
<P>After the &s;hip was removed into deeper water, and pro|perly &s;ecured, I went with the pinnace and yawl, manned and armed, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and landed upon the i&s;land, which was about three quarters of a mile di&s;tant: we ob&s;erved that the canoes which were about the &s;hip, did not follow us upon our leaving her, which we thought a good &s;ign; but we had no &s;ooner landed than they crouded to different parts of the i&s;land and came on &s;hore. We were in a little cove, and in a few minutes were
<PB N="364" REF="402">
&s;urrounded by two or three hundred people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s;. 29.</NOTE> &s;ome ru&s;hing from behind the heads of the cove, and others appearing on the tops of the hills: they were all armed, but they came on in &s;o confu&s;ed and &s;traggling a manner that we &s;carcely &s;u&s;|pected they meant us any harm, and we were determined that ho&s;tilities &s;hould not begin on our part. We marched towards them, and then drew a line upon the &s;and between them and us, which we gave them to under&s;tand they were not to pa&s;s: at fir&s;t they continued quiet, but their weapons were held ready to &s;trike, and they &s;eemed to be rather irre|&s;olute than peaceable. While we remained in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, another party of Indians came up, and now grow|ing more bold as their number increa&s;ed, they began the dance and &s;ong, which are their preludes to a battle: &s;till, however, they delayed the attack, but a party ran to each of our boats, and attempted to draw them on &s;hore; this &s;eemed to be the &s;ignal, for the people about us at the &s;ame time began to pre&s;s in upon our line: our &s;ituation was now be|come too critical for us to remain longer inactive, I therefore di&s;charged my mu&s;ket, which was loaded with &s;mall &s;hot, at one of the forwarde&s;t, and Mr. Banks and two of the men fired immediately afterwards: this made them fall back in &s;ome confu&s;ion, but one of the Chiefs, who was at the di&s;|tance of about twenty yards, rallied them, and running for|ward waving his patoo-patoo, and calling loudly to his companions, led them to the charge. Dr. Solander, who&s;e piece was not yet di&s;charged, fired at this champion, who &s;topped &s;hort upon feeling the &s;hot, and then ran away with the re&s;t: they did not however di&s;per&s;e, but got together upon a ri&s;ing ground, and &s;eemed only to want &s;ome leader of re&s;olution to renew their attack. As they were now be|yond the reach of &s;mall &s;hot, we fired with ball, but as none of them took place they &s;till continued in a body, and in
<PB N="365" REF="403">
this &s;ituation we remained about a quarter of an hour:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s;. 29.</NOTE> in the mean time the &s;hip, from whence a much greater num|ber of Indians were &s;een than could be di&s;covered in our &s;itu|ation, brought her broad-&s;ide to bear, and intirely di&s;per&s;ed them, by firing a few &s;hot over their heads. In this &s;kirmi&s;h only two of the Indians were hurt with the &s;mall &s;hot, and not a &s;ingle life was lo&s;t, which would not have been the ca&s;e if I had not re&s;trained the men, who, either from fear or the love of mi&s;chief, &s;hewed as much impatience to de&s;troy them as a &s;port&s;man to kill his game. When we were in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our cove, we laid down our arms and began to gather celery, which grew here in great plenty: after a little time we recollected to have &s;een &s;ome of the people hide them&s;elves in a cave of one of the rocks, we therefore went towards the place, when an old Indian, who proved to be the Chief that I had pre&s;ented with a piece of broad cloth in the morning, came out with his wife and his brother, and in a &s;upplicating po&s;ture put them&s;elves under our protection. We &s;poke kindly to them, and the old man then told us that he had another brother, who was one of tho&s;e that had been wounded by the &s;mall &s;hot, and enquired with much &s;olicitude and concern if he would die. We a&s;&s;ured him that he would not, and at the &s;ame time put into his hand both a mu&s;ket ball and &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot, telling him, that tho&s;e only who were wounded with the ball would die, and that the others would recover; at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;uring him, that if we were attacked again, we &s;hould certainly defend our&s;elves with the ball, which would wound them mortally. Having now taken courage, they came and &s;at down by us, and as tokens of our perfect amity, we made them pre&s;ents of &s;uch trifles as we hap|pened to have about us.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="404"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Wedne&s;. 29.</NOTE>Soon after we re-imbarked in our boats, and having rowed to another cove in the &s;ame i&s;land, climbed a neighbouring hill, which commanded the country to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The pro&s;pect was very uncommon and romantic, con&s;i&s;ting of innumerable i&s;lands, which formed as many harbours, where the water was as &s;mooth as a mill-pool: we &s;aw al&s;o many towns, &s;cattered hou&s;es, and plantations, the country being much more populous than any we had &s;een. One of the towns was very near us, from which many of the Indians advanced, taking great pains to &s;hew us that they were unarmed, and in their ge&s;tures and countenances expre&s;&s;ing great meekne&s;s and humility. In the mean time &s;ome of our people, who, when the Indians were to be pu|ni&s;hed for a fraud, a&s;&s;umed the inexorable ju&s;tice of a Ly|curgus, thought fit to break into one of their plantations, and dig up &s;ome potatoes: for this offence I ordered each of them to be puni&s;hed with twelve la&s;hes, after which two of them were di&s;charged; but the third, in&s;i&s;ting that it was no crime in an Engli&s;hman to plunder an Indian plantation, though it was a crime in an Indian to defraud an Engli&s;h|man of a nail, I ordered him back into his confinement, from which I would not relea&s;e him till he had received &s;ix la&s;hes more.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 30.</NOTE>On the 30th, there being a dead calm, and no probability of our getting to &s;ea, I &s;ent the Ma&s;ter, with two boats to &s;ound the harbour; and all the forenoon had &s;everal canoes about the &s;hip, who traded in a very fair and friendly man|ner. In the evening we went a&s;hore upon the main, where the people received us very cordially; but we found nothing worthy of notice.</P>
<P>In this bay we were detained by contrary winds and calms &s;everal days, during which time our intercour&s;e with the
<PB N="367" REF="405">
natives was continued in the mo&s;t peaceable and friendly manner, they being frequently about the &s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Thur&s;day 30.</NOTE> and we a&s;hore, both upon the i&s;lands and the main. In one of our vi&s;its to the continent, an old man &s;hewed us the in&s;trument they u&s;e in &s;taining their bodies, which exactly re&s;embled tho&s;e that were employed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e at Otaheite. We &s;aw al&s;o the man who was wounded in attempting to &s;teal our buoy: the ball had pa&s;&s;ed through the fle&s;hy part of his arm, and grazed his brea&s;t; but the wound, under the care of Nature, the be&s;t &s;urgeon, and a &s;imple diet, the be&s;t nur&s;e, was in a good &s;tate, and &s;eemed to give the patient neither pain nor apprehen&s;ion. We &s;aw al&s;o the brother of our old Chief, who had been wounded with &s;mall &s;hot in our &s;kirmi&s;h: they had &s;truck his thigh obliquely, and though &s;everal of them were &s;till in the fle&s;h, the wound &s;eemed to be attended with neither danger nor pain. We found among their plantations the <HI>morus papyrifera,</HI> of which the&s;e people, as well as tho&s;e of Otaheite, make cloth; but here the plant &s;eems to be rare, and we &s;aw no pieces of the cloth large enough for any u&s;e but to wear by way of orna|ment in their ears.</P>
<P>Having one day landed in a very di&s;tant part of the bay, the people immediately fled, except one old man, who ac|companied us wherever we went, and &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with the little pre&s;ents we made him. We came at la&s;t to a little fort, built upon a &s;mall rock, which at high water was &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and acce&s;&s;ible only by a ladder: we perceived that he eyed us with a kind of re&s;tle&s;s &s;olicitude as we approached it, and upon our expre&s;&s;ing a de&s;ire to enter it, he told us that his wife was there: he &s;aw that our curi|o&s;ity was not dimini&s;hed by this intelligence, and after &s;ome he&s;itation, he &s;aid, if we would promi&s;e to offer no indecency he would accompany us: our promi&s;e was readily given,
<PB N="368" REF="406">
and he immediately led the way.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. November. Thur&s;day 30.</NOTE> The ladder con&s;i&s;ted of &s;teps fa&s;tened to a pole, but we found the a&s;cent both diffi|cult dangerous. When we entered we found three women, who, the moment they &s;aw us, bur&s;t into tears of terror and &s;urprize: &s;ome kind words and a few pre&s;ents &s;oon removed their apprehen&s;ions, and put them into good humour. We examined the hou&s;e of our old friend, and by his intere&s;t two others, which were all that the fortification contained, and having di&s;tributed a few more pre&s;ents, we parted with mutual &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">December. Tue&s;day 5.</NOTE>At four o'clock in the morning of the 5th of December, we weighed, with a light breeze, but it being variable with fre|quent calms, we made little way. We kept turning out of the bay till the afternoon, and about ten o'clock we were &s;uddenly becalmed, &s;o that the &s;hip would neither wear nor &s;tay, and the tide or current &s;etting &s;trong, &s;he drove towards land &s;o fa&s;t, that before any mea&s;ures could be taken for her &s;ecurity &s;he was within a cable's length of the breakers: we had thirteen fathom water, but the ground was &s;o foul that we did not dare to drop our anchor; the pinnace therefore was immediately hoi&s;ted out to take the &s;hip in tow, and the men, &s;en&s;ible of their danger, exerting them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, and a faint breeze &s;pringing up off the land, we perceived with un&s;peakable joy that &s;he made head way, after having been &s;o near the &s;hore that Tupia, who was not &s;en&s;ible of our hair's breadth e&s;cape, was at this very time conver&s;ing with the people upon the beach, who&s;e voices were di&s;tinctly heard, notwith&s;tanding the roar of the breakers. We now thought all danger was over, but about an hour afterwards, ju&s;t as the man in the chains had cried "&s;eventeen fathom," the &s;hip &s;truck. The &s;hock threw us all into the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation; Mr. Banks, who had un|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf and was &s;tepping into bed, ran ha&s;tily up to
<PB N="369" REF="407">
the deck,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. December. Tue&s;day 5.</NOTE> and the man in the chains called out "five fa|thom;" by this time, the rock on which we had &s;truck being to windward, the &s;hip went off without having received the lea&s;t damage, and the water very &s;oon deepened to twenty fathom.</P>
<P>This rock lies half a mile W. N. W. of the northermo&s;t or outermo&s;t i&s;land on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay. We had light airs from the land, with calms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 6.</NOTE> till nine o'clock the next morning, when we got out of the bay, and a breeze &s;pringing up at N. N. W. we &s;tood out to &s;ea.</P>
<P>This bay, as I have before ob&s;erved, lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of Cape Bret, and I named it the BAY OF ISLANDS, from the great number of i&s;lands which line its &s;hores, and form &s;everal harbours equally &s;afe and commodious, where there is room and depth for any number of &s;hipping. That in which we lay is on the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;outh we&s;ter|mo&s;t i&s;land, called MATUARO, on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of the bay. I have made no accurate &s;urvey of this bay, being di&s;|couraged by the time it would co&s;t me; I thought al&s;o that it was &s;ufficient to be able to affirm that it afforded us good an|chorage, and refre&s;hment of every kind. It was not the &s;ea&s;on for roots, but we had plenty of fi&s;h, mo&s;t of which, however, we purcha&s;ed of the natives, for we could catch very little our&s;elves either with net or line. When we &s;hewed the natives our &s;eine, which is &s;uch as the King's &s;hips are generally furni&s;hed with, they laughed at it, and in triumph produced their own, which was indeed of an enormous &s;ize, and made of a kind of gra&s;s, which is very &s;trong: it was five fathom deep, and by the room it took up, it could not be le&s;s than three or four hundred fathom long. Fi&s;hing &s;eems indeed to be the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of life in this part of the country; we &s;aw about all their towns a great
<PB N="370" REF="408">
number of nets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. December. Wedne&s;. 6.</NOTE> laid in heaps like hay-cocks, and covered with a thatch to keep them from the weather, and we &s;carcely entered a hou&s;e where &s;ome of the people were not employed in making them. The fi&s;h we procured here were &s;harks, &s;ting-rays, &s;ea-bream, mullet, mackrel, and &s;ome others.</P>
<P>The inhabitants in this bay are far more numerous than in any other part of the country that we had before vi&s;ited; it did not appear to us that they were united under one head, and though their towns were fortified, they &s;eemed to live together in perfect amity.</P>
<P>It is high water in this bay at the full and change of the moon, about eight o'clock, and the tide then ri&s;es from &s;ix to eight feet perpendicularly. It appears, from &s;uch ob|&s;ervations as I was able to make of the tides upon the &s;ea|coa&s;t, that the flood comes from the &s;outhward; and I have rea&s;on to think that there is a current which comes from the we&s;tward, and &s;ets along the &s;hore to the S. E. or S. S. E. as the land happens to lie.</P>

In the afternoon, we &s;tood in &s;hore, and fetched clo&s;e tinder the Cavalles, from which i&s;lands the main trends W. by N.: &s;everal canoes put off and followed us, but a light breeze &s;pringing up, I did not chu&s;e to wait for them.

W. till the next morning ten o'clock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 8.</NOTE> when I tacked and &s;tood in for the &s;hore, from which we were about five leagues di&s;tant. At noon, the we&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight bore W. by S. and was about four leagues di&s;tant. In the afternoon, we had a gentle breeze to the we&s;t, which in the evening came to the &s;outh, and continuing &s;o all night,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 9.</NOTE> by day-light brought us pretty well in with the land, &s;even leagues to the we&s;tward of the Cavalles, where we found a deep bay run|ning in S. W. by W. and W. S. W. the bottom of which we could but ju&s;t &s;ee, and there the land appeared to be low and level. To this bay, which I called DOUBTLESS BAY, the en|trance is formed by two points, which lie W. N. W. and E. S. E. and are five miles di&s;tant from each other. The
<PB N="372" REF="410">
wind not permitting us to look in here,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. December. Saturday 9.</NOTE> we &s;teered for the we&s;termo&s;t land in &s;ight, which bore from us W. N. W. about three leagues, but before we got the length of it it fell calm.</P>
<P>While we lay becalmed, &s;everal canoes came off to us, but the people having heard of our guns, it was not without great difficulty that they were per&s;uaded to come under our &s;tern: after having bought &s;ome of their cloaths, as well as their fi&s;h, we began to make enquiries concerning their country, and learnt, by the help of Tupia, that, at the di&s;|tance of three days rowing in their canoes, at a place called MOORE-WHENNUA, the land would take a &s;hort turn to the &s;outhward, and from thence extend no more to the we&s;t. This place we concluded to be the land di&s;covered by Ta&s;|man, which he called CAPE MARIA VAN DIEMEN, and find|ing the&s;e people &s;o intelligent, we inquired farther, if they knew of any country be&s;ides their own: they an&s;wered, that they never had vi&s;ited any other, but that their ance&s;tors had told them, that to the N. W. by N. or N. N. W. there was a country of great extent, called ULIMAROA, to which &s;ome people had &s;ailed in a very large canoe; that only part of them returned, and reported, that after a pa&s;&s;age of a month they had &s;een a country where the people eat hogs. Tupia then enquired whether the&s;e adventurers brought any hogs with them when they returned; they &s;aid No: then, replied Tupia, your &s;tory is certainly fal&s;e, for it cannot be believed that men who came back from an expedition without hogs, had ever vi&s;ited a country where hogs were to be procured. It is however remarkable, notwith&s;tanding the &s;hrewdne&s;s of Tupia's objection, that when they mentioned hogs it was not by de&s;cription but by name, calling them <HI>Booah,</HI> the name which is given them in the South-&s;ea i&s;lands; but if
<PB N="373" REF="411">
the animal had been wholly unknown to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. December. Saturday 9.</NOTE> and they had had no communication with people to whom it was known, they could not po&s;&s;ibly have been acquainted with the name.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock at night, a breeze &s;prung up at W. N. W. with which we &s;tood off north; and at noon the next day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 10.</NOTE> the Cavalles bore S. E. by E. di&s;tant eight leagues; the entrance of Doubtle&s;s Bay S. by W. di&s;tant three leagues; and the north we&s;t extremity of the land in &s;ight, which we judged to be the main, bore N. W. by W.: our latitude by ob&s;erva|tion was 34&deg; 44&prime; S. In the evening, we found the variation to be 12&deg; 41&prime; E. by the azimuth, and 12&deg; 40&prime; by the ampli|tude.</P>
<P>Early in the morning, we &s;tood in with the land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 11.</NOTE> &s;even leagues to the we&s;tward of Doubtle&s;s Bay, the bottom of which is not far di&s;tant from the bottom of another large bay, which the &s;hore forms at this place, being &s;eparated only by a low neck of land, which juts out into a penin&s;ula that I have called KNUCKLE POINT. About the middle of this bay, which we called SANDY BAY, is a high mountain, &s;tand|ing upon a di&s;tant &s;hore, to which I gave the name of MOUNT CAMEL. The latitude here is 34&deg; 51&prime; S. and longitude 186&deg; 50&prime;. We had twenty-four and twenty-five fathom wa|ter, with a good bottom; but there &s;eems to be nothing in this bay that can induce a &s;hip to put into it; for the land about it is utterly barren and de&s;olate, and, except Mount Camel, the &s;ituation is low: the &s;oil appears to be nothing but white &s;and, thrown up in low irregular hills and narrow ridges, lying parallel with the &s;hore. But barren and de&s;o|late as this place is, it is not without inhabitants: we &s;aw one village on the we&s;t &s;ide of Mount Camel, and another on the ea&s;t &s;ide; we &s;aw al&s;o five canoes full of people, who pulled after the &s;hip, but could not come up with us. At
<PB N="374" REF="412">
nine o'clock,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1769. December. Monday 11.</NOTE> we tacked and &s;tood to the northward; and at noon, the Cavalles bore S.

<P>The wind being contrary, we kept plying northward till five o'clock in the evening of the 12th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 12.</NOTE> when, having made very little way, we tacked and &s;tood to the N. E. being two leagues to the northward of Mount Camel, and about a mile and a half from the &s;hore, in which &s;ituation we had two and twenty fathom water.</P>
<P>At ten, it began to blow and rain, which brought us under double reefed top&s;ails; at twelve, we tacked and &s;tood to the we&s;tward till &s;even the next morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 13.</NOTE> when we tacked and &s;tood again to the N.

It lies in latitude 34&deg; 22&prime; S. longitude 186&deg; 55&prime; W. and thirty-one leagues di&s;|tant from Cape Bret, in the direction of N. 63 W. It forms the north point of Sandy Bay, and is a penin&s;ula jutting out N. E. about two miles, and terminating in a bluff head that is flat at the top. The i&s;thmus which joins this head to the main land is very low, and for that rea&s;on the land of the Cape, from &s;everal &s;ituations, has the appearance of an i&s;land. It is &s;till more remarkable when it is &s;een from the &s;outhward, by the appearance of a high round i&s;land at the S.

At day-break the next morn|ing, we found our&s;elves between two and three leagues from the land, which began to have a better appearance, ri&s;ing in gentle &s;lopes, and being covered with trees and herbage. We &s;aw a &s;moke and a few hou&s;es, but it appeared to be but thinly inhabited. At &s;even o'clock, we &s;teered S. by E. and afterwards S. by W. the land lying in that direction.

About eleven miles from this Head, in the direction of S. W. &frac12; W. lies a very &s;mall i&s;land, upon which we &s;aw a great number of gannets, and which we therefore called GANNET ISLAND. At noon, a high craggy point bore E. N.

Soon after, it fell calm; and being in forty-two fathom water, the people caught a few &s;ea-bream. At eleven, a light breeze &s;prung up from the we&s;t, and we made &s;ail to the &s;outhward. We continued to &s;teer S. by W. and S. S. W. along the &s;hore, at the di&s;tance of about four leagues with gentle breezes from between N.W. and N. N. E. At &s;even in the evening, we &s;aw the top of the Peak to the &s;outhward, above the clouds which con|cealed it below. And at this time, the &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore S. by W. the variation, by &s;everal azimuths which were taken both in the morning and the evening, appeared to be 14&deg; 15&prime; ea&s;terly.</P>

<P>With this view, I kept plying on and off all night, having from eighty to &s;ixty-three fathom. At day-break the next morning, I &s;tood for an inlet which runs in S. W.;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 15.</NOTE> and at eight I got within the entrance, which may be known by a reef of rocks, &s;tretching from the north we&s;t point, and &s;ome rocky i&s;lands which lie off the &s;outh ea&s;t point. At nine o'clock, there being little wind, and what there was being variable, we were carried by the tide or current within two cables' length of the north we&s;t &s;hore, where we had fifty-four fathom water, but by the help of our boats we got clear. Ju&s;t at this time we &s;aw a &s;ea-lion ri&s;e twice near the &s;hore, the head of which exactly re&s;embled that of the male which has been de&s;cribed in the Account of Lord An&s;on's Voyage. We al&s;o &s;aw &s;ome of the natives in a canoe cro&s;s the bay, and a village &s;ituated upon the point of an i&s;land which lies &s;even or eight miles within the entrance. At noon, we were the length of this i&s;land, but there being little wind, the boats
<PB N="386" REF="425">
were ordered ahead to tow.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Monday 15.</NOTE> About one o'clock, we hauled clo&s;e round the &s;outh we&s;t end of the i&s;land; and the inha|bitants of the village which was built upon it, were imme|diately up in arms. About two, we anchored in a very &s;afe and convenient cove, on the north we&s;t &s;ide of the bay, and facing the &s;outh we&s;t end of the i&s;land, in eleven fathom water, with &s;oft ground, and moored with the &s;tream anchor.</P>
<P>We were about four long cannon &s;hot di&s;tant from the the village or Heppah, from which four canoes were imme|diately di&s;patched, as we imagined to reconnoitre, and if they &s;hould find them&s;elves able, to take us. The men were all well armed, and dre&s;&s;ed nearly as they are re|pre&s;ented in the figure publi&s;hed by Ta&s;man; two corners of the cloth which they wrapped round the body were pa&s;&s;ed over the &s;houlders from behind, and being brought down to the upper edge of it before, were made fa&s;t to it ju&s;t under the brea&s;t; but few, or none, had feathers in their hair. They rowed round the &s;hip &s;everal times, with their u&s;ual tokens of menace and defiance, and at la&s;t began the a&s;&s;ault by throwing &s;ome &s;tones: Tupia expo&s;tulated with them, but apparently to very little purpo&s;e; and we began to fear that they would oblige us to fire at them, when a very old man in one of the boats expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of coming on board. We gladly encouraged him in his de&s;ign, a rope was thrown into his canoe, and &s;he was immediately along&s;ide of the &s;hip: the old man ro&s;e up, and prepared to come up the &s;hip's &s;ide, upon which all the re&s;t expo&s;tulated with great vehemence again&s;t the attempt, and at la&s;t laid hold of him, and held him back: he adhered however to his purpo&s;e with a calm but &s;teady per&s;everance, and having at length di&s;engaged him&s;elf, he came on board. We received him with all po&s;&s;ible expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and kindne&s;s, and
<PB N="387" REF="426">
after &s;ome time di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Monday 15.</NOTE> with many pre&s;ents to his companions. As &s;oon as he was returned on board his ca|noe, the people in all the re&s;t began to dance, but whether as a token of enmity or friend&s;hip we could not certainly determine, for we had &s;een them dance in a di&s;po&s;ition both for peace and war. In a &s;hort time, however, they retired to their fort, and &s;oon after I went on &s;hore, with mo&s;t of the gentlemen, at the bottom of the cove, a-brea&s;t of the &s;hip.</P>
<P>We found a fine &s;tream of excellent water, and wood in the greate&s;t plenty, for the land here was one fore&s;t, of va&s;t extent. As we brought the &s;eine with us, we hauled it once or twice, and with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s that we caught near three hundred weight of fi&s;h of different &s;orts, which was equally di&s;tributed among the &s;hip's company.</P>
<P>At day-break, while we were bu&s;y in careening the &s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 16.</NOTE> three canoes came off to us, having on board above a hun|dred men, be&s;ides &s;everal of their women, which we were plea&s;ed to &s;ee, as in general it is a &s;ign of peace; but they &s;oon afterwards became very trouble&s;ome, and gave us rea|&s;on to apprehend &s;ome mi&s;chief from them to the people that were in our boats along&s;ide the &s;hip. While we were in this &s;ituation, the long-boat was &s;ent a&s;hore with &s;ome water ca&s;ks, and &s;ome of the canoes attempting to follow her, we found it nece&s;&s;ary to intimidate them by firing &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot: we were at &s;uch a di&s;tance that it was impo&s;&s;ible to hurt them, yet our reproof had its effect, and they de&s;i&s;ted from the pur&s;uit. They had &s;ome fi&s;h in their canoes which they now offered to &s;ell, and which, though it &s;tunk, we con&s;ented to buy: for this purpo&s;e a man in a &s;mall boat was &s;ent among them, and they traded for &s;ome time very fairly. At length, however, one of them watching his opportunity,
<PB N="388" REF="427">
&s;natched at &s;ome paper which our market-man held in his hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Tue&s;day 16.</NOTE> and mi&s;&s;ing it, immediately put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence, flouri&s;hing his patoo-patoo, and making &s;how as if he was about to &s;trike; &s;ome &s;mall &s;hot were then fired at him from the &s;hip, a few of which &s;truck him upon the knee: this put an end to our trade, but the Indians &s;till con|tinued near the &s;hip, rowing round her many times, and conver&s;ing with Tupia, chiefly concerning the traditions they had among them with re&s;pect to the antiquities of their country. To this &s;ubject they were led by the enquiries which Tupia had been directed to make, whether they had ever &s;een &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el as ours, or had ever heard that any &s;uch had been upon their coa&s;t. The&s;e enquiries were all an&s;wered in the negative, &s;o that tradition has pre&s;erved among them no memorial of Ta&s;man; though, by an ob|&s;ervation made this day, we find that we are only fifteen miles &s;outh of Murderer's bay, our latitude being 41&deg; 5&prime; 32&Prime;, and Murderer's bay, according to his account, being 40&deg; 50&prime;.</P>
<P>The women in the&s;e canoes, and &s;ome of the men, had a head-dre&s;s which we had not before &s;een. It con&s;i&s;ted of a bunch of black feathers, made up in a round form, and tied upon the top of the head, which it intirely covered, and made it twice as high, to appearance, as it was in reality.</P>
<P>After dinner, I went in the pinnace with Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Tupia, and &s;ome others, into another cove, about two miles di&s;tant from that in which the &s;hip lay: in our way we &s;aw &s;omething floating upon the water, which we took for a dead &s;eal, but upon rowing up to it, found it to be the body of a woman, which to all appearance had been dead &s;ome days. We proceeded to our cove, where we went on &s;hore, and found a &s;mall family of Indians, who ap|peared to be greatly terrified at our approach, and all ran
<PB N="389" REF="428">
away except one.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770 January. Tue&s;day 16.</NOTE> A conver&s;ation between this per&s;on and Tupia &s;oon brought back the re&s;t, except an old man and a child, who &s;till kept aloof, but &s;tood peeping at us from the woods. Of the&s;e people, our curio&s;ity naturally led us to enquire after the body of the woman which we had &s;een floating upon the water: and they acquainted us, by Tupia, that &s;he was a relation, who had died a natural death; and that, according to their cu&s;tom, they had tied a &s;tone to the body, and thrown it into the &s;ea, which &s;tone, they &s;up|po&s;ed, had by &s;ome accident been di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>This family, when we came on &s;hore, was employed in dre&s;&s;ing &s;ome provi&s;ions: the body of a dog was at this time buried in their oven, and many provi&s;ion ba&s;kets &s;tood near it. Having ca&s;t our eyes carele&s;sly into one of the&s;e, as we pa&s;&s;ed it, we &s;aw two bones pretty cleanly picked, which did not &s;eem to be the bones of a dog, and which, upon a nearer examination, we di&s;covered to be tho&s;e of a human body. At this &s;ight we were &s;truck with horror, though it was only a confirmation of what we had heard many times &s;ince we arrived upon this coa&s;t. As we could have no doubt but the bones were human, neither could we have any doubt but that the fle&s;h which covered them had been eaten. They were found in a provi&s;ion ba&s;ket; the fle&s;h that remained appeared manife&s;tly to have been dre&s;&s;ed by fire, and in the gri&s;tles at the end, were the marks of the teeth which had gnawed them: to put an end however to conjecture, founded upon circum&s;tances and appearances, we directed Tupia to a&s;k what bones they were; and the Indians, without the lea&s;t he&s;itation, an&s;wered, the bones of a man: they were then a&s;ked what was become of the fle&s;h, and they replied that they had eaten it; but, &s;aid Tupia, why did you not eat the body of the woman which we &s;aw floating upon the water: the woman, &s;aid they, died of di&s;ea&s;e; be&s;ides, &s;he
<PB N="390" REF="429">
was our relation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Tue&s;day 16.</NOTE> and we eat only the bodies of our enemies, who are killed in battle. Upon enquiry who the man was who&s;e bones we had found, they told us, that about five days before, a boat belonging to their enemies came into the bay, with many per&s;ons on board, and that this man was one of &s;even whom they had killed. Though &s;tronger evi|dence of this horrid practice prevailing among the inhabit|ants of this coa&s;t will &s;carcely be required, we have &s;till &s;tronger to give. One of us a&s;ked if they had any human bones with the fle&s;h remaining upon them, and upon their an&s;wering us that all had been eaten, we affected to di&s;be|lieve that the bones were human, and &s;aid that they were the bones of a dog; upon which one of the Indians with &s;ome eagerne&s;s took hold of his own fore-arm, and thru&s;ting it towards us, &s;aid, that the bone which Mr. Banks held in his hand had belonged to that part of a human body; at the &s;ame time, to convince us that the fle&s;h had been eaten, he took hold of his own arm with his teeth, and made &s;hew of eating: he al&s;o bit and gnawed the bone which Mr. Banks had taken, drawing it through his mouth, and &s;hewing, by &s;igns, that it had afforded a delicious repa&s;t; the bone was then returned to Mr. Banks, and he brought it away with him. Among the per&s;ons of this family, there was a woman who had her arms, legs, and thighs frightfully cut in &s;eve|ral places; and we were told that &s;he had inflicted the wounds upon her&s;elf, in token of her grief for the lo&s;s of her hu&s;band, who had been lately killed and eaten by their enemies, who had come from &s;ome place to the ea&s;tward, towards which the Indians pointed.</P>
<P>The &s;hip lay at the di&s;tance of &s;omewhat le&s;s than a quar|ter of a mile from the &s;hore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 17.</NOTE> and in the morning we were awakened by the &s;inging of the birds: the number was in|credible, and they &s;eemed to &s;train their throats in emulation
<PB N="391" REF="430">
of each other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Wedne&s;. 17.</NOTE> This wild melody was infinitely &s;uperior to any that we had ever heard of the &s;ame kind; it &s;eemed to be like &s;mall bells, mo&s;t exqui&s;itely tuned, and perhaps the di&s;tance, and the water between, might be no &s;mall advan|tage to the &s;ound. Upon enquiry, we were informed that the birds here always began to &s;ing about two hours after midnight, and continuing their mu&s;ick till &s;un-ri&s;e, were, like our nightingales, &s;ilent the re&s;t of the day. In the fore|noon, a &s;mall canoe came off from the Indian village to the &s;hip, and among tho&s;e that were in it, was the old man who had fir&s;t come on board at our arrival in the bay. As &s;oon as it came along&s;ide, Tupia renewed the conver&s;ation, that had pa&s;&s;ed the day before, concerning their practice of eating human fle&s;h, during which they repeated what they had told us already: but, &s;aid Tupia, where are the heads? do you eat them too? Of the heads, &s;aid the old man, we eat only the brains, and the next time I come I will bring &s;ome of them to convince you that what we have told you is truth. After &s;ome farther conver&s;ation between the&s;e people and Tupia, they told him that they expected their enemies to come very &s;hortly, to revenge the death of the &s;even men whom they had killed and eaten.</P>
<P>On the 18th, the Indians were more quiet than u&s;ual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 18.</NOTE> no canoe came near the &s;hip, nor did we &s;ee one of them moving on the &s;hore, their fi&s;hing, and other u&s;ual occupations being totally &s;u&s;pended. We thought they expected an attack on this day, and therefore attended more diligently to what pa&s;&s;ed on &s;hore; but we &s;aw nothing to gratify our curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>After breakfa&s;t, we went out in the pinnace, to take a view of the bay, which was of va&s;t extent, and con&s;i&s;ted of numberle&s;s &s;mall harbours and coves, in every direction: we
<PB N="392" REF="431">
confined our excur&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Thur&s;day 18.</NOTE> however, to the we&s;tern &s;ide, and the country being an impenetrable fore&s;t where we landed, we could &s;ee nothing worthy of notice: we killed, however, a good number of &s;haggs, which we &s;aw &s;itting upon their ne&s;ts in the trees, and which, whether roa&s;ted or &s;tewed, we con&s;idered as very good provi&s;ion. As we were returning, we &s;aw a &s;ingle man in a canoe fi&s;hing; we rowed up to him, and to our great &s;urprize he took not the lea&s;t notice of us, but even when we were along&s;ide of him, continued to follow his occupation, without adverting to us any more than if we had been invi&s;ible. He did not, however, appear to be either &s;ullen or &s;tupid: we reque&s;ted him to draw up his net, that we might examine it, and he readily complied: it was of a circular form, extended by two hoops, and about &s;even or eight feet in diameter: the top was open, and &s;ea-ears were fa&s;tened to the bottom as a bait: this he let down &s;o as to lie upon the ground, and when he thought fi&s;h enough were a&s;&s;embled over it, he drew it up by a very gentle and even motion, &s;o that the fi&s;h ro&s;e with it, &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible that they were lifted, till they came very near the &s;urface of the water, and then were brought out in the net by a &s;udden jerk. By this &s;imple method he had caught abundance of fi&s;h, and indeed they are &s;o plenty in this bay, that the catching them requires neither much labour nor art.</P>
<P>This day, &s;ome of our people found in the &s;kirts of the wood, near a hole or oven, three human hip-bones, which they brought on board; a farther proof that the&s;e people eat human fle&s;h: Mr. Monkhou&s;e, our Surgeon, al&s;o brought on board, from a place where he &s;aw many de&s;erted hou&s;es, the hair of a man's head, which he had found, among many other things, tied up to the branches of trees.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="432">In the morning of the 19th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Friday 19.</NOTE> we &s;et up the armourer's forge to repair the braces of the tiller, and other iron-work, all hands on board being &s;till bu&s;y in careening, and other nece&s;&s;ary operations about the ve&s;&s;el: this day, &s;ome Indians came on board from another part of the bay, where they &s;aid there was a town which we had not &s;een: they brought plenty of fi&s;h, which they &s;old for nails, having now ac|quired &s;ome notion of their u&s;e; and in this traffick no un|fair practice was attempted.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 20th, our old man kept his promi&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 20.</NOTE> and brought on board four of the heads of the &s;even people who had been &s;o much the &s;ubject of our enquiries: the hair and fle&s;h were entire, but we perceived that the brains had been extracted; the fle&s;h was &s;oft, but had by &s;ome method been pre&s;erved from putrefaction, for it had no di&s;agreeable &s;mell. Mr. Banks purcha&s;ed one of them, but they &s;old it with great reluctance, and could not by any means be pre|vailed upon to part with a &s;econd; probably they may be pre&s;erved as trophies, like the &s;calps in America, and the jaw-bones in the i&s;lands of the South Seas. Upon examining the head which had been bought by Mr. Banks, we perceived that it had received a blow upon the temples, which had fractured the &s;kull. This day we made another excur&s;ion in the pinnace, to &s;urvey the bay, but we found no flat large enough for a potatoe garden, nor could we di&s;cover the lea&s;t appearance of cultivation: we met not a &s;ingle Indian, but found an excellent harbour; and about eight o'clock in the evening returned on board the &s;hip.</P>
<P>On the 21&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 21.</NOTE> Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went a fi&s;hing with hook and line, and caught an immen&s;e quantity every where upon the rocks, in between four and five fathom water: the &s;eine was hauled every night, and &s;eldom failed
<PB N="394" REF="433">
to &s;upply the whole &s;hip's company with as much fi&s;h as they could eat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Sunday 21.</NOTE> This day all the people had leave to go on &s;hore at the watering-place, and divert them&s;elves as they &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 22.</NOTE>In the morning of the 22d, I &s;et out again in the pinnace, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, with a de&s;ign to examine the head of the inlet, but after rowing about four or five leagues without &s;o much as coming in &s;ight of it, the wind being contrary, and the day half &s;pent, we went on &s;hore on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide, to try what might be di&s;covered from the hills.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander immediately employed them|&s;elves in botanizing near the beach, and I, taking a &s;eaman with me, a&s;cended one of the hills: when I reached the &s;ummit, I found a view of the inlet intercepted by hills, which in that direction ro&s;e &s;till higher, and which were rendered inacce&s;&s;ible by impenetrable woods; I was, how|ever, abundantly compen&s;ated for my labour, for I &s;aw the &s;ea on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the country, and a pa&s;&s;age leading from it to that on the we&s;t, a little to the ea&s;tward of the en|trance of the inlet where the &s;hip now lay. The main land which lay on the &s;outh ea&s;t &s;ide of this inlet, appeared to be a narrow ridge of very high hills, and to form part of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treight; the land on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide appeared to trend away ea&s;t as far as the eye could reach; and to the &s;outh ea&s;t there appeared to be an opening to the &s;ea, which wa&s;hed the ea&s;tern coa&s;t: on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the inlet al&s;o I &s;aw &s;ome i&s;lands which I had before taken to be part of the main land. Having made this di&s;covery, I de|&s;cended the hill, and as &s;oon as we had taken &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, we &s;et out on our return to the &s;hip. In our way, we examined the harbours and coves which lie behind the
<PB N="395" REF="434">
i&s;lands that I had di&s;covered from the hill;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Monday 22.</NOTE> and in this rout we &s;aw an old village, in which there were many hou&s;es that &s;eemed to have been long de&s;erted: we al&s;o &s;aw another village which was inhabited, but the day was too far &s;pent for us to vi&s;it it, and we therefore made the be&s;t of our way to the &s;hip, which we reached between eight and nine o'clock at night.</P>
<P>The 23d I employed in carrying on a &s;urvey of the place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 23.</NOTE> and upon one of the i&s;lands where I landed, I &s;aw many hou&s;es which &s;eemed to have been long de&s;erted, and no ap|pearance of any inhabitant.</P>
<P>On the 24th,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 24.</NOTE> we went to vi&s;it our friends at the Hippah or village on the point of the i&s;land near the &s;hip's &s;tation, who had come off to us on our fir&s;t arrival in the bay. They re|ceived us with the utmo&s;t confidence and civility, &s;hewing us every part of their habitations, which were commodious and neat. The i&s;land or rock on which this town is &s;ituated, is divided from the main by a breach or fi&s;&s;ure &s;o narrow, that a man might almo&s;t leap from one to the other: the &s;ides of it are every where &s;o &s;teep as to render the artificial fortifica|tion of the&s;e people almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary: there was, how|ever, one &s;light palli&s;ade, and one &s;mall fighting-&s;tage, to|wards that part of the rock where acce&s;s was lea&s;t difficult.</P>
<P>The people here brought us out &s;everal human bones, the fle&s;h of which they had eaten, and offered them to &s;ale; for the curio&s;ity of tho&s;e among us who had purcha&s;ed them as memorials of the horrid practice which many, notwith&s;tand|ing the reports of travellers, have profe&s;&s;ed not to believe, had rendered them a kind of article of trade. In one part of this village we ob&s;erved, not without &s;ome &s;urprize, a cro&s;s exactly like that of a crucifix; it was adorned with feathers,
<PB N="396" REF="435">
and upon our enquiring for what purpo&s;e it had been &s;et up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Wedne&s;. 24.</NOTE> we were told that it was a monument for a man who was dead: we had before under&s;tood that their dead were not bu|ried, but thrown into the &s;ea; but to our enquiry how the body of the man had been di&s;po&s;ed of, to who&s;e memory this cro&s;s had been erected, they refu&s;ed to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>When we left the&s;e people, we went to the other end of the i&s;land, and there taking water, cro&s;&s;ed over to the main, where we &s;aw &s;everal hou&s;es, but no inhabitants, except a few in &s;ome &s;traggling canoes, that &s;eemed to be fi&s;hing, After viewing this place, we returned on board the &s;hip to dinner.</P>
<P>During our vi&s;it to the Indians this day, Tupia being al|ways of our party, they had been ob&s;erved to be continually talking of guns, and &s;hooting people: for this &s;ubject of their conver&s;ation we could not at all account; and it had &s;o much engaged our attention, that we talked of it all the way back, and even after we got on board the &s;hip: we had perplexed our&s;elves with various conjectures, which were all given up in their turn; but now we learnt, that on the 21&s;t one of our officers, upon pretence of going out to fi&s;h, had rowed up to the Hippah, and that two or three canoes coming off towards his boat, his fears &s;ugge&s;ted that an attack was intended, in con&s;equence of which three mu&s;kets were fired, one with &s;mall &s;hot, and two with ball, at the Indians, who retired with the utmo&s;t precipitation, having probably come out with friendly intentions, for &s;uch their behaviour both before and afterwards expre&s;&s;ed, and having no rea&s;on to expect &s;uch treatment from people who had al|ways behaved to them not only with humanity, but kind|ne&s;s, and to whom they were not con&s;cious of having given offence.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="436">On the 25th, I made another excur&s;ion along the coa&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Thur&s;day 25.</NOTE> in the pinnace, towards the mouth of the inlet, accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and going on &s;hore at a little cove, to &s;hoot &s;haggs, we fell in with a large family of In|dians, who&s;e cu&s;tom it is to di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves among the different creeks and coves, where fi&s;h is to be procured in the greate&s;t plenty, leaving a few only in the Hippah, to which the re&s;t repair in times of danger. Some of the&s;e people came out a good way to meet us, and gave us an in|vitation to go with them to the re&s;t of their party, which we readily accepted. We found a company of about thirty, men, women, and children, who received us with all po&s;|&s;ible demon&s;trations of friend&s;hip: we di&s;tributed among them a few ribands and beads, and in return, received the ki&s;&s;es and embraces of both &s;exes, both young and old: they gave us al&s;o &s;ome fi&s;h, and after a little time we returned, much plea&s;ed with our new acquaintance.</P>
<P>In the morning of the 26th, I went again out in the boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 26.</NOTE> with Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, and entered one of the bays, which lie on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the inlet, in order to get another &s;ight of the &s;treight, which pa&s;&s;ed between the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern &s;eas. For this purpo&s;e, having landed at a convenient place, we climbed a hill of very con&s;iderable height, from which we had a full view of it, with the land on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore, which we judged to be about four leagues di&s;tant; but as it was hazey in the horizon, we could not &s;ee far to the &s;outh ea&s;t: I re&s;olved however to &s;earch the pa&s;&s;age with the &s;hip, as &s;oon as I &s;hould put to &s;ea. Upon the top of this hill we found a parcel of loo&s;e &s;tones, with which we erected a pyramid, and left in it &s;ome mu&s;ket balls, &s;mall &s;hot, beads, and other things, which we happened to have about us, that were likely to &s;tand the te&s;t of time, and not being of Indian workman&s;hip, would con|vince

any European who &s;hould come to the place and pull it down,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Friday 26.</NOTE> that other natives of Europe had been there before him. When this was done, we de&s;cended the hill, and made a comfortable meal of the &s;haggs and fi&s;h which our guns and lines had procured us, and which were dre&s;&s;ed by the boat's crew in a place that we had appointed: in this place we found another Indian family, who received us, as u&s;ual, with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s and plea&s;ure, &s;hewing us where to procure water, and doing us &s;uch other good offices as were in their power. From this place we went to the town, of which the Indians had told us, who vi&s;ited us on the 19th: this, like that which we had &s;een before, was built upon a &s;mall i&s;land or rock, &s;o difficult of acce&s;s, that we gratified our curio&s;ity at the ri&s;k of our necks. The In|dians here al&s;o received us with open arms, carried us to every part of the place, and &s;hewed us all that it contained: this town, like the other, con&s;i&s;ted of between eighty and an hundred hou&s;es, and had only one fighting-&s;tage. We hap|pened to have with us a few nails and ribands, and &s;ome paper, with which our gue&s;ts were &s;o gratified, that at our coming away they filled our boat with dried fi&s;h, of which we perceived they had laid up great quantities.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 27.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 29.</NOTE>On the 29th, we received a vi&s;it from our old man, who&s;e name we found to be TOPAA, and three other natives, with whom Tupia had much conver&s;ation. The old man told us, that one of the men who had been fired upon by the officer who had vi&s;ited their Hippah, under pretence of fi&s;hing, was dead; but to my great comfort I afterwards di&s;covered that this report was not true, and that if Topa~a's di&s;cour&s;es were

taken literally, they would frequently lead us into mi&s;takes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Monday 29.</NOTE> Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were &s;everal times on &s;hore during the la&s;t two or three days, not without &s;ucce&s;s, but greatly circum&s;cribed in their walks by climbers of a mo&s;t luxuriant growth, which were &s;o interwoven together, as to fill up the &s;pace between the trees about which they grew, and render the woods altogether impa&s;&s;able. This day al&s;o I went on &s;hore again my&s;elf, upon the we&s;tern point of the inlet, and from a hill of con&s;iderable height, I had a view of the coa&s;t to the N. W. The farthe&s;t land I could &s;ee in that quarter, was an i&s;land which has been mentioned be|fore, at the di&s;tance of about ten leagues, lying not far from the main: between this i&s;land and the place where I &s;tood, I di&s;covered, clo&s;e under the &s;hore, &s;everal other i&s;lands, form|ing many bays, in which there appeared to be good an|chorage for &s;hipping. After I had &s;et off the different points for my &s;urvey, I erected another pile of &s;tones, in which I left a piece of &s;ilver coin, with &s;ome mu&s;ket balls and beads, and a piece of an old pendant flying on the top. In my re|turn to the &s;hip, I made a vi&s;it to &s;everal of the natives, whom I &s;aw along the &s;hore, and purcha&s;ed a &s;mall quantity of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>On the 30th, early in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tue&s;day 30.</NOTE> I &s;ent a boat to one of the i&s;lands for celery, and while the people were gathering it, about twenty of the natives, men, women, and children, landed near &s;ome empty huts: as &s;oon as they were on &s;hore, five or &s;ix of the women &s;at down upon the ground together, and began to cut their legs, arms, and faces, with &s;hells, and &s;harp pieces of talc or ja&s;per, in a terrible man|ner. Our people under&s;tood that their hu&s;bands had lately been killed by their enemies; but while they were perform|ing this horrid ceremony, the men &s;et about repairing the huts, with the utmo&s;t negligence and unconcern.</P>
<P><PB N="400" REF="439"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Tue&s;day 30.</NOTE>The carpenter having prepared two po&s;ts to be left as me|morials of our having vi&s;ited this place, I ordered them to be in&s;cribed with the &s;hip's name, and the year and month; one of them I &s;et up at the watering-place, hoi&s;ting the Union flag upon the top of it; and the other I carried over to the i&s;land that lies neare&s;t to the &s;ea, called by the natives MO|TUARA. I went fir&s;t to the village or Hippah, accompanied by Mr. Monkhou&s;e and Tupia, where I met with our old man, and told him and &s;everal others, by means of Tupia, that we were come to &s;et up a mark upon the i&s;land, in order to &s;how to any other &s;hip which &s;hould happen to come thither, that we had been there before. To this they readily con|&s;ented, and promi&s;ed that they never would pull it down: I then gave &s;omething to every one pre&s;ent; and to the old man I gave a &s;ilver threepence, dated 1736, and &s;ome &s;pike nails, with the king's broad arrow cut deep upon them; things which I thought mo&s;t likely to remain long among them: I then took the po&s;t to the highe&s;t part of the i&s;land, and after fixing it firmly in the ground, I hoi&s;ted upon it the Union-flag, and honoured this inlet with the name of QUEEN CHARLOTTE's SOUND, at the &s;ame time taking formal po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this and the adjacent country, in the name and for the u&s;e of his Maje&s;ty King George the Third. We then drank a bottle of wine to her Maje&s;ty's health, and gave the bottle to the old man who had attended us up the hill, and who was mightily delighted with his pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>While the po&s;t was &s;etting up, we enquired of the old man concerning the pa&s;&s;age into the ea&s;tern &s;ea, the exi&s;tence of which he confirmed; and then a&s;ked him about the land to the S. W. of the &s;treight, where we were then &s;ituated: this land, he &s;aid, con&s;i&s;ted of two Whennuas or i&s;lands, which might be circumnavigated in a few days, and which he called TOVY POENAMMOO; the literal tran&s;lation of this word
<PB N="401" REF="440">
is "the water of green talc:"<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. January. Tue&s;day 30.</NOTE> and probably if we had under|&s;tood him better, we &s;hould have found that Tovy Poenammoo was the name of &s;ome particular place where they got the green talc or &s;tone of which they make their ornaments and tools, and not a general name for the whole &s;outhern di&s;trict: he &s;aid, there was al&s;o a third Whennua, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treight, the circumnavigation of which would take up many moons: this he called EAHEINOMAUWE; and to the land on the borders of the &s;treight he gave the name of TIERA WITTE. Having &s;et up our po&s;t, and procured this intelligence, we returned on board the &s;hip, and brought the old man with us, who was attended by his canoe, in which, after dinner, he returned home.</P>
<P>On the 31&s;t, having completed our wooding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 31.</NOTE> and filled all our water ca&s;ks, I &s;ent out two parties, one to cut and make brooms, and another to catch fi&s;h. In the evening, we had a &s;trong gate from the N. W. with &s;uch a heavy rain that our little wild mu&s;icians on &s;hore &s;u&s;pended their &s;ong, which till now we had con&s;tantly heard during the night, with a plea&s;ure which it was impo&s;&s;ible to lo&s;e without regret.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t, the gale increa&s;ed to a &s;torm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February. Thur&s;day 1.</NOTE> with heavy gu&s;ts from the high land, one of which broke the haw&s;er, that we had fa&s;tened to the &s;hore, and obliged us to let go another anchor. Towards midnight, the gale became more mode|rate, but the rain continued with &s;uch violence, that the brook which had &s;upplied us with water overflowed its banks, and carried away ten &s;mall ca&s;ks which had been left there full of water, and notwith&s;tanding we &s;earched the whole cove, we could never recover one of them.</P>
<P>On the 3d, as I intended to &s;ail the fir&s;t opportunity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Saturday 3.</NOTE> I went over to the Hippah on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Sound, and pur|cha&s;ed a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;plit and half-dried fi&s;h, for

&s;ea &s;tores.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Saturday 3.</NOTE> The people here confirmed all that the old man had told us concerning the &s;treight and the country, and about noon I took leave of them: &s;ome of them &s;eemed to be &s;orry, and others glad, that we were going: the fi&s;h which I had bought they &s;old freely, but there were &s;ome who &s;hewed manife&s;t &s;igns of di&s;approbation. As we re|turned to the &s;hip, &s;ome of us made an excur&s;ion along the &s;hore to the northward, to traffick with the natives for a far|ther &s;upply of fi&s;h, in which, however, they had no great &s;ucce&s;s. In the evening, we got every thing off from the &s;hore, as I intended to &s;ail in the morning, but the wind would not permit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sunday 4.</NOTE>On the 4th, while we were waiting for a wind, we amu&s;ed our&s;elves by fi&s;hing, and gathering &s;hells and &s;eeds of various kinds:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monday 5.</NOTE> and early in the morning of the 5th, we ca&s;t off the haw&s;er, hove &s;hort on the bower, and carried the kedge anchor out in order to warp the &s;hip out of the cove, which having done about two o'clock in the afternoon, we hove up the anchor and got under &s;ail; but the wind &s;oon fail|ing, we were obliged to come to an anchor again a little above Motuara. When we were under &s;ail, our old man Topa~a came on board to take his leave of us, and as we were &s;till de&s;irous of making farther enquiries whether any me|mory of Ta&s;man had been pre&s;erved among the&s;e people, Tupia was directed to a&s;k him whether he had ever heard that &s;uch a ve&s;&s;el as ours had before vi&s;ited the country. To this he replied in the negative, but &s;aid, that his ance&s;tors had told him there had once come to this place a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, from a di&s;tant country, called ULIMAROA, in which were four men, who, upon their coming on &s;hore, were all killed: upon being a&s;ked where this di&s;tant land lay, he pointed to the northward. Of Ulimaroa we had heard &s;ome|thing before, from the people about the Bay of I&s;lands, who
<PB N="403" REF="442">
&s;aid that their ance&s;tors had vi&s;ited it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Monday 5.</NOTE> and Tupia had al&s;o talked to us of Ulimaroa, concerning which he had &s;ome confu&s;ed traditionary notions, not very different from tho&s;e of our old man, &s;o that we could draw no certain conclu&s;ion from the accounts of either.</P>
<P>Soon after the &s;hip came to an anchor the &s;econd time, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on &s;hore, to &s;ee if any gleanings of natural knowlege remained, and by accident fell in with the mo&s;t agreeable Indian family they had &s;een, which afforded them a better opportunity of remarking the per|&s;onal &s;ubordination among the&s;e people, than had before offered. The principal per&s;ons were a widow, and a pretty boy about ten years old: the widow was mourning for her hu&s;band with tears of blood, according to their cu&s;tom, and the child, by the death of its father, was become proprietor of the land where we had cut our wood. The mother and the &s;on were &s;itting upon matts, and the re&s;t of the family, to the number of &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen, of both &s;exes, &s;at round them in the open air, for they did not appear to have any hou&s;e, or other &s;helter from the weather, the inclemen|cies of which, cu&s;tom has probably enabled them to endure without any la&s;ting inconvenience. Their whole behaviour was affable, obliging, and un&s;u&s;picious; they pre&s;ented each per&s;on with fi&s;h, and a brand of fire to dre&s;s it, and pre&s;&s;ed them many times to &s;tay till the morning, which they would certainly have done if they had not expected the &s;hip to &s;ail, greatly regretting that they had not become acquainted with them &s;ooner, as they made no doubt but that more knowlege of the manners and di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants of this country would have been obtained from them in a day, than they had yet been able to acquire during our whole &s;tay upon the coa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="443"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Tue&s;day 6.</NOTE>On the 6th, about &s;ix o'clock in the morning, a light breeze &s;prung up at north, and we again got under &s;ail, but the wind proving variable, we reached no farther than ju&s;t with|out Motuara; in the afternoon, however, a more &s;teady gale at N. by W. &s;et us clear of the Sound, which I &s;hall now de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound is &s;ituated in la|titude 41&deg; S. longitude 184&deg; 45&prime; W. and near the middle of the &s;outh we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;treight in which it lies. The land of the &s;outh ea&s;t head of the Sound, called by the natives KOAMAROO, off which lie two &s;mall i&s;lands and &s;ome rocks, makes the narrowe&s;t part of the &s;treight. From the north we&s;t head a reef of rocks runs out about two miles, in the direction of N. E. by N.; part of which is above the water, and part below. By this account of the heads, the Sound will be &s;ufficiently known: at the entrance, it is three leagues broad, and lies in S.W. by S. S. W. and W.S.W. at lea&s;t ten leagues, and is a collection of &s;ome of the fine&s;t harbours in the world, as will appear from the plan, which is laid down with all the accuracy that time and circum&s;tances would ad|mit. The land forming the harbour or cove in which we lay, is called by the natives TOTARRANUE: the harbour it&s;elf, which I called SHIP COVE, is not inferior to any in the Sound, either for convenience or &s;afety: it lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Sound, and is the &s;outhermo&s;t of three coves, that are &s;ituated within the i&s;land of Motuara, which bears ea&s;t of it. Ship Cove may be entered, either between Motuara and a long i&s;land, called by the natives HAMOTE, or between Mo|tuara and the we&s;tern &s;hore. In the la&s;t of the&s;e channels are two ledges of rocks, three fathom under water, which may ea&s;ily be known by the &s;ea-weed that grows upon them. In &s;ailing either in or out of the Sound, with little wind, at|tention

mu&s;t be had to the tides,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Tue&s;day 6.</NOTE> which flow about nine or ten o'clock at the full and change of the moon, and ri&s;e and fall between &s;even and eight feet perpendicularly. The flood comes in through the &s;treight from the S. E. and &s;ets &s;trongly over upon the north we&s;t head, and the reef that lies off it: the ebb &s;ets with &s;till greater rapidity to the S. E. over upon the rocks and i&s;lands that lie off the &s;outh ea&s;t head. The variation of the compa&s;s we found from good ob&s;ervation, to be 13&deg; 5&prime; E.</P>
<P>The land about this &s;ound, which is of &s;uch a height that we &s;aw it at the di&s;tance of twenty leagues, con&s;i&s;ts wholly of high hills and deep vallies, well &s;tored with a variety of excellent timber, fit for all purpo&s;es except ma&s;ts, for which it is too hard and heavy. The &s;ea abounds with a variety of fi&s;h, &s;o that without going out of the cove where we lay, we caught every day, with the &s;eine and hooks and lines, a quan|tity &s;ufficient to &s;erve the whole &s;hip's company: and along the &s;hore we found plenty of &s;hags, and a few other &s;pecies of wild-fowl, which tho&s;e who have long lived upon &s;alt provi&s;ions will not think de&s;picable food.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants &s;carcely exceeds four hundred, and they live di&s;per&s;ed along the &s;hores, where their food, con&s;i&s;ting of fi&s;h and fern roots, is mo&s;t ea&s;ily procured; for we &s;aw no cultivated ground. Upon any appearance of dan|ger, they retire to their Hippahs, or forts; in this &s;ituation we found them, and in this &s;ituation they continued for &s;ome time after our arrival. In compari&s;on of the inhabitants of other parts of this country, they are poor, and their canoes are without ornament: the little traffic we had with them was wholly for fi&s;h, and indeed they had &s;carcely any thing el&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of. They &s;eemed, however, to have &s;ome knowlege of iron, which the inhabitants of &s;ome other parts
<PB N="406" REF="445">
had not;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Tue&s;day 6.</NOTE> for they willingly took nails for their fi&s;h, and &s;ometimes &s;eemed to prefer it to every thing el&s;e that we could offer, which had not always been the ca&s;e. They were at fir&s;t very fond of paper; but when they found that it was &s;poiled by being wet, they would not take it: neither did they &s;et much value upon the cloth of Otaheite; but Engli&s;h broad cloth, and red ker&s;ey, were in high e&s;timation; which &s;hewed that they had &s;en&s;e enough to appretiate the com|modities which we offered by their u&s;e, which is more than could be &s;aid of &s;ome of their neighbours, who made a much better appearance. Their dre&s;s has been mentioned already, particularly their large round head-dre&s;&s;es of fea|thers, which were far from being unbecoming.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we got out of the Sound, I &s;tood over to the ea&s;tward, in order to get the &s;treight well open before the tide of ebb came on. At &s;even in the evening, the two &s;mall i&s;lands which lie off Cape Koamaroo, the &s;outh ea&s;t head of Queen Charlotte's Sound, bore ea&s;t, di&s;tant about four miles: at this time it was nearly calm, and the tide of ebb &s;etting out, we were, in a very &s;hort time, carried by the ra|pidity of the &s;tream clo&s;e upon one of the i&s;lands, which was a rock ri&s;ing almo&s;t perpendicularly out of the &s;ea: we per|ceived our danger increa&s;e every moment, and had but one expedient to prevent our being da&s;hed to pieces, the &s;ucce&s;s of which a few minutes would determine. We were now within little more than a cable's length of the rock, and had more than &s;eventy-five fathom water; but upon dropping an anchor, and veering about one hundred and fifty fathom of cable, the &s;hip was happily brought up: this, however, would not have &s;aved us, if the tide which &s;et S. by E. had not, upon meeting with the i&s;land, changed its direction to S. E. and carried us beyond the fir&s;t point. In this &s;ituation, we were not above two cables' length from the
<PB N="407" REF="446">
rocks; and here we remained in the &s;trength of the tide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Tue&s;day 6.</NOTE> which &s;et to the S. E. after the rate of at lea&s;t five miles an hour, from a little after &s;even till near midnight, when the tide abated, and we began to heave.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wedne&s;. 7.</NOTE> By three in the morn|ing the anchor was at the bows, and having a light breeze at N. W. we made &s;ail for the ea&s;tern &s;hore; but the tide being again&s;t us, we made but little way: the wind however afterwards fre&s;hened, and came to N. and N. E. with which, and the tide of ebb, we were in a &s;hort time hurried through the narrowe&s;t part of the &s;treight, and then &s;tood away for the &s;outhermo&s;t land we had in &s;ight, which bore from us S. by W. Over this land appeared a mountain of &s;tupendous height, which was covered with &s;now.</P>
<P>The narrowe&s;t part of the &s;treight, through which we had been driven with &s;uch rapidity, lies between Cape Tiera|witte, on the coa&s;t of Eaheinomauwe, and Cape Koamaroo: the di&s;tance between them I judged to be between four or five leagues, and notwith&s;tanding the tide, now its &s;trength is known, may be pa&s;&s;ed without much danger. It is how|ever &s;afe&s;t to keep on the north ea&s;t &s;hore, for on that &s;ide there appeared to be nothing to fear; but on the other &s;hore there are not only the i&s;lands and rocks which lie off Cape Koamaroo, but a reef of rocks &s;tretching from the&s;e i&s;lands &s;ix or &s;even miles to the &s;outhward, at the di&s;tance of two or three miles from the &s;hore, which I had di&s;covered from the hill when I took my &s;econd view of the &s;treight from the ea&s;t to the we&s;tern &s;ea. The length of the &s;treight we had pa&s;&s;ed I &s;hall not pretend to a&s;&s;ign, but &s;ome judgment may be formed of it from a view of the chart.</P>
<P>About nine leagues north from Cape Tierawitte, and un|der the &s;ame &s;hore, is a high and remarkable i&s;land which may be di&s;tinctly &s;een from Queen Charlotte's Sound, from

which it is di&s;tant about &s;ix or &s;even leagues.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Wedne&s;. 7.</NOTE> This i&s;land, which was noticed when we pa&s;&s;ed it on the 14th of January, I have called ENTRY ISLE.</P>
<P>On the ea&s;t &s;ide of Cape Tierawitte, the land trends away S. E. by E. about eight leagues, where it ends in a point, and is the &s;outhermo&s;t land on Eaheinomauwe. To this point I have given the name of CAPE PALLISER, in honour of my worthy friend Captain Palli&s;er. It lies in latitude 41&deg; 34&prime; S. longitude 183&deg; 58&prime; W. and bore from us this day at noon S. 79 E. di&s;tant about thirteen leagues, the &s;hip being then in the la|titude of 41&deg; 27&prime; S.; Koamaroo at the &s;ame time bearing N. &frac12; E. di&s;tant &s;even or eight leagues. The &s;outhermo&s;t land in &s;ight bore S. 16 W. and the &s;nowy mountain S. W. At this time we were about three leagues from the &s;hore, and abrea&s;t of a deep bay or inlet, to which I gave the name of CLOUDY BAY, and at the bottom of which there appeared low land covered with tall trees.</P>
<P>At three o'clock in the afternoon we were abrea&s;t of the &s;outhermo&s;t point of land that we had &s;een at noon, which I called CAPE CAMPBEL; it lies S. by W. di&s;tant between twelve and thirteen leagues from Cape Koamaroo, in lati|tude 41&deg; 44&prime; S. longitude 183&deg; 45&prime; W.; and with Cape Palli&s;er forms the &s;outhern entrance of the &s;treight, the di&s;tance be|tween them being between thirteen and fourteen leagues W. by S. and E. by N.</P>
<P>From this Cape we &s;teered along the &s;hore S.W. by S. till eight o'clock in the evening, when the wind died away. About half an hour afterwards, however, a fre&s;h breeze &s;prung up at S.W. and I put the &s;hip right before it. My rea&s;on for this, was a notion which &s;ome of the officers had ju&s;t &s;tarted, that Eahienomauwe was not an i&s;land, and that the land might &s;tretch away to the S.E. from between Cape
<PB N="409" REF="448">
Turnagain and Cape Palli&s;er,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Wedne&s;. 7.</NOTE> there being a &s;pace of between twelve and fifteen leagues that we had not &s;een. I had in|deed the &s;tronge&s;t conviction that they were mi&s;taken, not only from what I had &s;een the fir&s;t time I di&s;covered the &s;treight, but from many other concurrent te&s;timonies that the land in que&s;tion was an i&s;land; but being re&s;olved to leave no po&s;&s;ibility of doubt with re&s;pect to an object of &s;uch importance, I took the opportunity of the wind's &s;hifting, to &s;tand ea&s;tward, and accordingly &s;teered N. E. by E. all the night.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thur&s;day 8.</NOTE> At nine o'clock in the morning we were abrea&s;t of Cape Palli&s;er, and found the land trend away N. E. towards Cape Turnagain, which I reckoned to be di&s;tant about twenty-&s;ix leagues: however, as the weather was hazy, &s;o as to prevent our &s;eeing above four or five leagues, I &s;till kept &s;tanding to the N. E. with a light breeze at &s;outh; and at noon Cape Palli&s;er bore N. 72 W. di&s;tant about three leagues.</P>
<P>About three o'clock in the afternoon, three canoes came up to the &s;hip with between thirty and forty people on board, who had been pulling after us with great la|bour and per&s;everance for &s;ome time: they appeared to be more cleanly, and a better cla&s;s, than any we had met with &s;ince we left the Bay of I&s;lands, and their canoes were al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame ornaments which we had &s;een upon the northerly part of the coa&s;t. They came on board with very little invitation; and their behaviour was courteous and friendly: upon receiving pre&s;ents from us, they made us pre&s;ents in return, which had not been done by any of the natives that we had &s;een before. We &s;oon perceived that our gue&s;ts had heard of us, for as &s;oon as they came on board, they a&s;ked for <HI>Whow,</HI> the name by which nails were known among the people with whom we had trafficked: but though they had heard of nails, it was plain, they had &s;een
<PB N="410" REF="449">
none;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1770. February. Thur&s;day 8.</NOTE> for when nails were given them, they a&s;ked Tupia what they were. The term <HI>Whow,</HI> indeed, conveyed to them the idea not of their quality, but only of their u&s;e; for it is the &s;ame by which they di&s;tingui&s;h a tool, commonly made of bone, which they u&s;e both as an augur and a chi&s;&s;el. However, their knowing that we had <HI>Whow</HI> to &s;ell, was a proof that their connections extended as far north as Cape Kidnappers, which was di&s;tant no le&s;s than forty-five leagues; for that was the &s;outhermo&s;t place on this &s;ide the coa&s;t where we had had any traffic with the natives. It is al&s;o probable, that the little knowlege which the inhabitants of Queen Charlotte's Sound had of iron, they obtained from their neighbours at Tierawitte; for we had no rea&s;on to think that the inhabitants of any part of this coa&s;t had the lea&s;t knowlege of iron or its u&s;e before we came among them, e&s;pecially as when it was fir&s;t offered they &s;eemed to di&s;|regard it as of no value. We thought it probable, that we were now once more in the territories of Teratu; but upon enquiring of the&s;e people, they &s;aid that he was not their King. After a &s;hort time, they went away, much gratified with the pre&s;ents that we had made them; and we pur&s;ued our cour&s;e along the &s;hore to the N. E. till eleven o'clock the next morning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday 9.</NOTE> About this time, the weather happening to clear up, we &s;aw Cape Turnagain, bearing N. by E. &frac12; E. at the di&s;tance of about &s;even leagues: I then called the officers upon deck, and a&s;ked them, whether they were not now &s;atisfied, that Eahienomauwe was an i&s;land; they readily an&s;wered in the affirmative, and all doubts being now re|moved, we hauled our wind to the ea&s;tward.</P>
