<P>IT was the frequent Practice of the ancient <HI>Greek</HI> Tragedians, to make their Compo&s;itions for the <HI>Theatre</HI> &s;ub&s;ervient to the Welfare of the <HI>State.</HI> The Legi&s;lator's Wi&s;|dom was inforced by the Poet's Art.

<P>My LORD, it comes from one, who, altho' he hath not wanted Op|portunities, hath ever &s;corned to pro|&s;titute Addre&s;&s;es of this Kind to Views of Intere&s;t. But if it hath for once happened in his Time, that Virtue and Power are eminently united; his hone&s;t Di&s;dain of offering Incen&s;e to the <HI>one,</HI> &s;hall not intimi|date him from avowing his Reve|rence of the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>More e&s;pecially, the natural Re|lation which the De&s;ign of this Tra|gedy bears to your Grace's Conduct, gives its Author a kind of equitable Title, without Leave, to prefix your Name.
