<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THIS Piece was fini&s;h'd above Two Years ago, and put into my Hands, to make what U&s;e of it I thought fit. And tho' it co&s;t our Author but the Labour of a &s;ingle Month, or le&s;s, yet, upon this Occa&s;ion, I can't but think the pub|li&s;hing it will oblige the World, &s;ince it is a Sequel to Mr. <HI>Philips </HI>'s Play of Duke <HI>Humfrey,</HI> and an Introduction to Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>'s Alteration of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third. Never Child had a more regardle&s;s Fa|ther, than the Parent of this; and therefore rather than have it &s;mother'd, I thought it a more Human Act to let it come upon the Pari&s;h. And, in my poor Opinion, I have &s;een a le&s;s promi&s;ing Appearance than this Brat carries about him, ri&s;e in the State.</P>
<Q><L>But if, like <HI>Phaeton,</HI> in <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Carr,</L>
<L>Th' unequal Mu&s;e unhappily &s;hould Err,</L>
<L>At lea&s;t you'll own from glorious Heights he fell,</L>
<L>And there's &s;ome Merit in attempting well.</L><BIBL>Prol. to XIMENA.</BIBL></Q>

<L>_NEVER had King le&s;s Joy in Rule than I,</L>
<L>Nor more Misfortune; Heaven was pleas'd to &s;et</L>
<L>My Cradle on the Top of humane Glory,</L>
<L>Where I lay helple&s;s, to all Storms ex|pos'd;</L>
<L>My childi&s;h Hand, not able to &s;upport</L>
<L>My Father's Sword, dropt the victorious Point,</L>
<L>And let fall all the Laurels that adorn'd it;</L>
<L>And <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ravag'd for the Spoil.</L>
<L>So lo&s;t I <HI>France;</HI> now am I threatned too</L>
<L>By wicked Rebels, with the Lo&s;s of <HI>England:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Cade</HI> and <HI>Plantagenet</HI> joyn to undo me.</L>
<L>Never did Subject long to be a King,</L>

<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Their Fault was great, 'tis true; but their Submi&s;&s;ion</L>
<L>Now cancels that, and they &s;hall meet my Mercy.</L>
<L>Therefore with plea&s;ing Pardon to them all,</L>
<L>I do di&s;mi&s;s 'em to their &s;everal Homes.</L>
</SP>

<L>Kings &s;hould have Mercy, but with it Ju&s;tice too.</L>

<L>Ju&s;t Heaven accept my Vows of Thanks and Prai&s;e,</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>Yes, Sir, I weep; but I weep Tears of Joy;</L>
<L>For I am cru&s;h'd between Two mighty Joys,</L>
<L>Your Royal Safety, and my Son's Succe&s;s.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>O gallant <HI>Clifford!</HI> how &s;hall I reward thee?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>I fought not for Rewards; or if I did,</L>
<L>I ought to end my Work e'er I be paid.</L>
<L>I have only now pull'd down a paltry Scaffold,</L>
<L>On which <HI>Plantagenet</HI> de&s;ign'd to climb,</L>
<L>To build his trayt'rous Projects&mdash;Have you not heard</L>
<L>The Duke of <HI>York</HI> is newly come from <HI>Ireland;</HI></L>
<L>And with a pui&s;&s;ant and mighty Power,</L>
<L>Is marching hitherwards in proud Array.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>True, he approaches with a mighty Ho&s;t,</L>

<L>To drive away from me &s;ome wicked Mini&s;ters.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>The con&s;tant Vizard of Rebellion.</L>
<L>Rebellion is &s;o foul and grim a Mon&s;ter,</L>

<L>To cover it all o'er with gawdy Trappings.</L>

<SPEAKER>K. Hen.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thus &s;tands my State, 'twixt <HI>Cade</HI> and <HI>York</HI> di&s;tre&s;t,</L>
<L>Like to a Ship, that having &s;cap'd a Tempe&s;t</L>
<L>Is &s;traitway calm'd, and boarded with a Pirate.</L>
<L>I pray thee, old <HI>Clifford,</HI> go and meet him,</L>

<L>From <HI>Ireland</HI> thus comes <HI>York</HI> to claim his Right,</L>

<L>Oh holy Maje&s;ty! who would not buy thee dear,</L>
<L>Let them obey that know not how to rule.</L>
<L>This Hand was made to handle nought but Gold.</L>
<L>I cannot give due Action to my Words,</L>

<L><HI>Clifford</HI> of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> I accept thy Greeting.</L>
<L>Art thou a Me&s;&s;enger, or come of Plea&s;ure?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Cliff.</SPEAKER>
<L>A Me&s;&s;enger from <HI>Henry</HI> our dread Liege,</L>
<L>To know the Rea&s;on of the&s;e Arms in Peace?</L>
<L>Or why, thou being a Subject, as I am,</L>
<L>Again&s;t thy Oath, and true Allegiance &s;worn,</L>

<L>Scarce can I &s;peak, my Choler is &s;o great.</L>

<L>I am &s;o angry at the&s;e abject Terms:</L>
<L>And now, like frantick <HI>Ajax,</HI></L>
<L>On Sheep, or Oxen, could I &s;pend my Fury.</L>
<L>I am far better born than is the King;</L>
<L>More like a King, more kingly in my Thoughts.</L>
<L>But I mu&s;t make fair Weather yet a while,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Henry</HI> be more weak, and I more &s;trong. <STAGE>[a&s;ide.]</STAGE></L>
<L>O <HI>Cumberland,</HI> I prithee pardon me,</L>
<L>That I have giv'n no An&s;wer all this while.</L>
<L>My Mind was troubled with deep Melancholy,</L>
<L>The Cau&s;e why I have brought this Army hither,</L>
<L>Is to remove proud <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> from the King,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="7">
Seditious to his Grace, and to the State.</L>

<SP>

<L>Some Time ago I drown'd this News in Tears,</L>

<L>I then in <HI>London,</HI> Keeper of the King,</L>
<L>Mu&s;ter'd my Soldiers, gather'd Flocks of Friends,</L>
<L>March'd towards St. <HI>Albans</HI> to intercept the Queen.</L>

<L>Short Tale to make, we at St. <HI>Albans</HI> met,</L>
<L>Our Battles join'd, and for long Time we fought;</L>

<L>Who look'd full gently on his warlike Queen,</L>

<L>Or, whether 'twas Report of her Succe&s;s,</L>
<L>Or more than common Fear of <HI>Clifford</HI>'s Vigor,</L>
<L>Who thunders to his Captives Blood and Death,</L>
<L>I cannot judge, but to conclude with Truth,</L>
