<HEAD>TO Mr. WILLIAM POWELL,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Pieces are the Production of my lei&s;ure Hours; they are imper|fect to a Degree, too full of Expletives and Incongruity; nothing cou'd have induc'd me to have publi&s;h'd them now, but my having promis'd them my Friends the&s;e two Years; and rather than they &s;hould accu&s;e me of being wor&s;e than my Word, I have ventur'd to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the Cen&s;ure of the World, and the Judgment of the Re|viewers; but as they are my fir&s;t Produc|tions, I could wi&s;h to be overlook'd, on the Promi&s;e they &s;hall be my la&s;t,&mdash;when I wrote them indeed I had the Vanity (like all
<PB N="vi" REF="8">
young Authors) to think I was &s;mitten with the Mu&s;es, but now to my Grief I too clear|ly &s;ee that I have &s;mitten them with a Stab of Di&s;grace; having di&s;turb'd and made muddy the peerle&s;s Stream of <HI>Helicon.</HI> My Preten&s;ions to Letters mu&s;t appear the highe&s;t Pre&s;umption, from many Rea&s;ons; fir&s;t from my humble and ob&s;cure Situation, and &s;econdly from my being depriv'd of a Cla&s;&s;ical Education, &amp;c. for great Scholars, like great Rogues, can take &s;uch Liberties as little ones dare not think of;&mdash;I have only this one Con&s;olation; that as my Re|putation as an Author is but little, I have the le&s;s to loo&s;e;&mdash;I don't doubt but this will be an unwelcome Offering; but I have pre&s;um'd to in&s;cribe it to you, becau&s;e I know you bear me that Friend&s;hip, that (were you &s;ure to derogate by &s;uch a Re|ception) you would take it as it was meant, the only Acknowledgment I had left, in Re|turn for the many Favours I have receiv'd, and the good Endeavours you have made to &s;erve me, tho' they unfortunately prov'd ineffectual. Dependance on Theatres are as fatal, and as tran&s;itory as at Court; and the
<PB N="vii" REF="9">
Promi&s;es of a Manager are as ba&s;ele&s;s as tho&s;e of a State&s;man; &s;o fond are all Degrees of apeing their Betters; this I have a Right to &s;peak, being prompted both by Fact and Experience; I cannot &s;ay indeed I had ever any great Dependance at Court; But to my Sorrow I know it, and at this Moment feel, the fatal Con&s;equence of depending on Theatres; and the alluring Promi&s;es (bound with the &s;acr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">d Ties of Honour and Friend|&s;hip) of Managers,&mdash; had I not been told by my Friends (and the&s;e too, in my Opinion, the be&s;t Judges of the age, &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Churchill,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lloyd,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> and your|&s;elf) that I was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;ome Requi&s;ites for the Stage, I had never attempted it; prompted by this, and con&s;cious of the Right, I as an Individual, had to an Attempt, and &s;trenghten'd by the Obligations that the Theatres, when in a drooping State, were once under to my Father, for his many excellent and receiv'd Entertainments; I was flatter'd into Hope and Expectation, giving up all my other Connections in Life, and &s;acrificing all other Intere&s;ts to the &s;eeming Friend&s;hip and &s;olemn Promi&s;es of Mr.
<PB N="viii" REF="10">
<HI>L</HI>&mdash;; who, like a Sorcerer, led me into a Labyrinth of Delu&s;ion, and left me to bewail my Situation in Oblivion. Could I but re|call the whole two Years Expence, the Lo&s;s of Time, and prevent the inevitable De&s;tru|ction of a dear and tender Family, I would forgive the heavy Load of Anxiety, the daily Expectations, and the hourly Di&s;ap|pointments that I met with; their Frowns of Authority, their Shafts of Impunity, their Stare of De&s;poti&s;m, and their Sneers of Contumely; all the&s;e I could forget, but that my Wounds &s;till bleed, and Pain begets Remembrance.</P>

<P>Good Morning to you, Doctor.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Blandford,</HI> your very humble Servant; how do you, this dull Morning? I'Gad I was threatening to go to Bed again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>To Bed, Doctor! What before you are well up? Of have your medical Studies kept you from &s;leeping all Night?</P>

<P>No&mdash;but I have got a na&s;ty &s;omething hanging on my Spirits.</P>

<P>An excellent Compliment!
<STAGE>[A&s;ide.]</STAGE>
As your Kind of Gentry know how to choo&s;e the be&s;t Wh&mdash;res.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your Pardon, Doctor, there is no be&s;t in the Ca&s;e; the be&s;t of the bad, is not worth choo&s;ing; but if you have no more Skill in Medicines, than I have in Filles de Joye, I would not give a Fig for your Practice. Talking of the Fair, puts me in Mind of poor Mi&s;s <HI>Dan|bury</HI>; never was &s;o good a Heart &s;o much depre&s;s'd: With blooming Beauty, and a Soul angelic, &s;he drags a Life of Woe, and keeps the Shield of Virtue on her Arm; while her Hand rejects with Scorn, the tempting Bribes of gay Debauchery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, you young Rogue, you've try'd her, I &s;uppo&s;e? But &s;he knew you had nothing to give her but Promi&s;es, and &s;o thought in that Ca&s;e &s;he might as well put on the Prude as not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, Doctor, that's a damn'd ill-na|tured Surmi&s;e, and did I not think you &s;poke it more out of Raillery, than Sincerity, I &s;hould for ever hold the mo&s;t contemptible Opinion of you as a Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you did not think I was in Earne&s;t, did you, <HI>Ned</HI>?</P>

<P>No&mdash;If I had!</P>
</SP>

<P>You'd have been for running me through the Body, I &s;uppo&s;e; but I a&s;&s;ure you the World &s;ays &s;trange Things of the Girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, it is a &s;trange World, Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but from the many pitiful Tricks, that I have detected her in my&s;elf, I am determined to have no|thing to do with her.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="3" REF="13">
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would have had (it is well known) if &s;he would have let you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's for you now! that's like her, I did ima|gine, indeed, (when I ceas'd to &s;upport the ungrateful Hu&s;&s;y, in her flaunting Expectations) &s;he would rai&s;e &s;ome &s;candalous Report or other, to hurt me in my Character and Bu&s;ine&s;s. Oh, the Jade! had it not been for the great Regard I had for the Father, &s;he &s;hould have &s;hifted for her&s;elf long ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Regard for her Father!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, my Regard for her Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what great Regard could you have for him, when I have often heard you &s;ay he died five hundred Pounds in your Debt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why tho' he was an unfortunate Man, he was an hone&s;t one, as far as his Circum&s;tances would go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's one of the mo&s;t grateful Confe&s;&s;ions I ever heard you make of any Man before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had ever the mo&s;t favourable Opinion of every Man, and was always more inclined to hide, than expo&s;e their Misfortunes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well again; &s;o &s;hall your own Words con|vict you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if you were inclined to think the mo&s;t fa|vourably of Man, you mu&s;t in Rea&s;on think the &s;ame of Woman Kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good again; and what has poor Mi&s;s <HI>Danbury</HI> done, that every Thought of her is bad, and your be&s;t Opinion but a fordid one?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but Facts, my dear <HI>Ned,</HI> are Facts, and the general and perpetual Complaints of the World are Cir|cum&s;tances too glaring to be overlook'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the World &s;ays in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, ought never to be regarded; for &s;uch Reports generally ari&s;e from the inventive Goffips of a Tea table; and there is a Species of Barbarity that reigns predominant in the Brea&s;ts of the low-minded Vulgar. Whenever they perceive an Object of Merit, that was once their Envy, under the lea&s;t Misfor|tune, they are never &s;o happy as when doing that Per&s;on
<PB N="4" REF="14">
&s;ome &s;ecret Injury, or till, by &s;ome malignant Con&s;piracy, they have reduced them to a State of Adver&s;ity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you &s;ay that this is her Ca&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly, for it is well known that Mi&s;s <HI>Dan|bury</HI> was (&s;carce three Years ago) the Admiration and En|vy of the Country for ten Miles round, and now, the ve|rie&s;t Drab that was wont to think her&s;elf honoured with a Court'&s;y from her, will, with a provoking Sneer, tell her to &s;horten her Furbelows; and &s;ince they have found her whole Dependence is on you, they have injured her, by impo&s;ing on you &s;ome malicious Fal&s;ehood, on the mere Suppo&s;ition of which, I find you are determined to com|pleat her Mi&s;ery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Mr. <HI>Blandford,</HI> it is not for that entirely, but from the very great Expence &s;he has been to me of late, and as I find that hurts my Circum&s;tances con&s;iderably, it is a Duty I owe my&s;elf not to let her ruin me entirely. I have made her many good Offers; nay I made Intere&s;t for her to a Gentleman and Lady who were going to <HI>South Ca|rolina,</HI> where they told her &s;he would have the greate&s;t Op|portunity in the World of making her Fortune; all which &s;he ungratefully rejected; and as I am under no Manner of Obligation to her, or hers, I think I have done for her al|ready what hundreds would not have done; in Truth therefore &s;he mu&s;t now &s;hift for her&s;elf as well as &s;he can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Girl! I can't blame her; 'tis &s;trange &s;o great a Tenderne&s;s Mr. <HI>Danbury</HI> had for her when living, that he did not make &s;ome Provi&s;ion for her at his Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the A&s;toni&s;hment of every one, but what could a Man do that had it not in his Power?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is &s;till more &s;trange, for every Body thought him a Man of Property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, <HI>Ned,</HI> you &s;ee with what Art &s;ome People can &s;upport a fal&s;e Reputatian, and when their Affairs come once to be laid open to In&s;pection, many a worthy Family that has tru&s;ted their All in their Hands, from too good an Opinion of their Circum&s;tances, find too often a broken Back in the Con&s;equence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I wi&s;h the dear Creature was better provi|ded for, or that I had it in my Power to make her the hap|pie&s;t Woman in the Univer&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="15">
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>How wou'd you do that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I wou'd endeavour to do it, by marrying her, and &s;etting her above the Frowns of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a promi&s;ing Dame you wou'd get for your Pains.&mdash;Ah, <HI>Ned.</HI> I pity you I mu&s;t confe&s;s.&mdash;But Plague on it, if you are &s;o wonderfully &s;mitten with the Wench, why don't you marry her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e I am not at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of tho&s;e Re|qui&s;ites, that would be e&s;&s;ential to our Happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a little Money, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;uppo&s;e right; wou'd the kind Powers be pleas'd to take that dear, pious, mercenary Uncle to them|&s;elves, I &s;hould be glad to fill up his Vacancy here below, without any further Con&s;ideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, my dear Boy, but your Uncle takes a deal of Care of his Con&s;titution, and is as likely to live thirty Years longer, as your&s;elf; you &s;hou'd have taken better Care of the la&s;t five Hundred, <HI>Ned.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I confe&s;s if I had been as penurious as you, I probably might have increas'd it to a Thou&s;and by this Time; and neither have done my&s;elf nor any body el&s;e any Good with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you had it now I don't think you wou'd do your|&s;elf much Good with it by marrying Mi&s;s <HI>Danbury.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are determined, I find, to do her no Good either by Word or Deed; and therefore, Doctor, I beg you wou'd not give me any more of your cool Opinions; &s;ince you cannot give her a good Word, you &s;hall not dare to give her a bad one in my Company without the warme&s;t Re&s;entment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, mighty well then; there let it drop&mdash; there let it drop; in the Name of Goodne&s;s may not one talk of Matrimony without having one's brains beat out.&mdash; Zounds I wi&s;h&mdash;I could meet with a good wife with all my Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a &s;pecial good Hu&s;band you'd make, if you thought you cou'd <HI>kill</HI> her with <HI>kindne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;If I thought you &s;erious, now, I would help you to a good one; but what will you give me for my trouble?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give you?&mdash;What do you call a good one tho'?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lady is not very hand&s;ome to be &s;ure, nor yet very young; but &s;he is worth a confounded deal of

Money I a&s;&s;ure you, and &s;uch a Woman can have nothing had about her I am per&s;uaded, at lea&s;t in your Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pitt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She cannot be bad that is certain, if &s;he is rich&punc; (for Money was never be&s;tow'd on any but tho&s;e that were good, and knew how to keep it when they had got it.) But how rich do you think the Lady may be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bland.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I have heard my Uncle &s;ay, that &s;he is worth Ten Thou&s;and Pounds at lea&s;t; but don't take the lea&s;t notice of it to him; for he wants to get her him&s;elf; only &s;he thinks him rather too old. &mdash; Now &s;uch a middle|ag'd Man as you, wou'd be the very Thing. Be&s;ides &s;he was a&s;king me who was our be&s;t Inoculator in this Neigh|bourhood. I told her I knew a very infallible one, meaning you; and &s;he has been teazing me about you ever &s;ince.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Buz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir, very true; I've been obliged to lend him Money, at different Times, to the Amount of two hun|dred Pounds, though it went very much again&s;t me to do it, had he not been a pretty near Relation, I wou'd not have done it on any Account. But he has certainly a deal of good Nature; and I know too that he'll pay when he has it, for I lent him a hundred and twenty Pounds before, and I mu&s;t &s;ay he pay'd me very hone&s;tly again, with good Intere&s;t into the Bargain. But if I could get him to pay the good two hundred Pounds he owes me now, I &s;hould hardly ri&s;k any more with him, I think.</P>

<L>To &s;ee his Child another's Claim,</L>
<L>And now he 'gan him&s;elf to blame.</L>
<L>The Swain beheld the good Man's Eyes,</L>
<L>With Tears he offer'd back his Prize.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The 'Squire charm'd at &s;uch a Deed</L>
<L>Cry'd you de&s;erve her now indeed!</L>
<L>It glads me much, young Swain to find,</L>
<L>Thou bear'&s;t &s;o great, &s;o good a Mind;</L>
<L>Here take her Lad,&mdash;I murmur not</L>
<L>If &s;he's contented with her Lot,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She &s;mil'd Con&s;ent, and chear'd the drooping Swain,</L>
<L>She gave her Hand, her Meaning to explain.</L>
<L>The 'Squire &s;aw, and ble&s;s'd the blooming Pair,</L>
<L>And three loud Vollies broke the peaceful Air.</L>

<HEAD>CHRISTMAS EVE IN THE COUNTRY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Mountain tops were tipt with driven Snow,</L>
<L>And Silver white were all the Vales below,</L>
<L>When, cea&s;ing thro' the frozen Field to roam,</L>
<L>Each Country Bumpkin ambles to his Home;</L>
<L>Enjoys what oft his betters do admire</L>
<L>In Winter Time,&mdash;a comfortable Fire,</L>
<L>There with his Spou&s;e and ro&s;y Brats regale</L>
<L>In &s;imple Mirth all round a Mug of Ale.</L>
<L>And now when &s;ome &s;age venerable 'Squire</L>
<L>Does from the Noi&s;e of this great Town retire,</L>
<L>To end his Days, forgetting King and Court,</L>
<L>And turns once more unto his youthful Sport;</L>
<L>But feels the Want of Strength, the Want of Sight,</L>
<L>And feels the Winter more &s;everely bite,</L>
<L>Than when his Blood, &s;ome forty Years ago</L>
<L>Wou'd reek with Ardour in <HI>December</HI>'s Snow;</L>
<L>Climb the &s;teep Hill, the flowing Riv'let fly,</L>
<L>And join with Speed the chearful Hunt&s;man's Cry</L>
<L>'Till the deep Vally eccho'd to the Sky.</L>
<L>Le&s;s Exerci&s;e poor Man will now content,</L>
<L>Infirmity will teach him to repent;</L>
<L><PB N="82" REF="91">And make Attonement for a Life of Sin,&mdash;</L>
<L>At three&s;core Years 'tis Time &s;ure to begin.</L>
<L>The Night approach'd, each Friend receives his Gue&s;t,</L>
<L>To drink an Health, or crack &s;ome merry Je&s;t</L>
<L>To eat and drink in hearty free Good will,</L>
<L>And all the Troubles of the Day to kill.</L>
<L>Tho' Ven'&s;on fumes ne'er taint their homely Board,</L>
<L>The fea&s;t on what they better can afford;</L>
<L>A good Sir Loin, a Pudding full of Plumbs,</L>
<L>Smoaking and hot upon the Table comes.</L>
<L>No Prince on Earth cou'd here refu&s;e to eat</L>
<L>So nice the Pudding and &s;o &s;weet the Meat.</L>
</LG>

<L>Once on a Time the Fire Side was grac'd</L>
<L>With &s;ix true pair of Lovers round it plac'd,</L>
<L>When biting Fro&s;t, and Snow be&s;pread the Green,</L>
<L>The Lads here &s;erv'd their La&s;&s;es for a Skreen,</L>
<L>By holding them as we do often &s;ee</L>
<L>The Lads in Town&mdash;their La&s;&s;es on their Knee;</L>
<L>Now each in Turn wou'd Sing a merry Song,</L>
<L>And &s;ome wou'd tell a Story very long,</L>
<L>While all attentive wou'd with Wonder hear,</L>
<L>And &s;hew'd with Eyes of Love an Heart of Fear;</L>
<L>One who refu&s;ed in his Turn to &s;ing,</L>
<L>Told a &s;ad Story of a murder'd King.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another cry'd, he heard his Granny &s;ay</L>
<L>As &s;he was pa&s;&s;ing thro' a lonely way,</L>
<L>The Night was dark and Glow-worms did appear,</L>
<L>When ev'ry Tree then added to her Fear.</L>
<L>And pa&s;&s;ing by a lonely Church Yard Wall</L>
<L>The Grave Stones mov'd, the Steeple &s;hook and all.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="83" REF="92">
<L>Another now began a woeful Tale</L>
<L>The very Thought of which oft turn'd him pale.&mdash;</L>
<L>Once, &s;aid he, a Lady fair and tall</L>
<L>Did walk a Nights upon our Garden Wall;</L>
<L>She &s;ometimes like a Sow and Pigs appear'd</L>
<L>And &s;ometimes like a Jew, with a long Beard,</L>
<L>And &s;ometimes like a greyhound, &s;leek and trim,</L>
<L>Sometimes like a Lion very Grim.</L>
<L>And once my Father &s;aid he &s;aw it &s;tand</L>
<L>With a bleeding Heart gra&s;p't within its Hand</L>
<L>And once he heard it like a Raven croak,</L>
<L>And thrice, they &s;ay, it to our Par&s;on &s;poke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At this &s;ad Tale, not one in all the Hou&s;e,</L>
<L>But even fear'd the moving of a Mou&s;e.</L>
<L>O lack a-Day, cry'd one fair trembling Maid,</L>
<L>I fear to move, I am &s;o much afraid.</L>
<L>Another, li&s;t'ning, thought &s;he heard a Voice,</L>
<L>Another cry'd, I'm &s;ure I heard a Noi&s;e.</L>
<L>Hu&s;h was the Word, while each with li&s;t'ning Fear,</L>
<L>Did, as it were, all &s;tatue-&s;truck appear.</L>
<L>Nor Eye, nor Finger now was &s;een to move,</L>
<L>But each pale Maid cling'd fa&s;t about her Love;</L>
<L>And all, the more from Fear, than from De&s;ire,</L>
<L>Mov'd by Degrees almo&s;t into the Fire.</L>
<L>A dreadful Clatter all at once was heard,</L>
<L>And in a Trice the Fire Side was clear'd;</L>
<L>Out at the Door they helter-&s;kelter ran,</L>
<L>Nor 'till the Morning did there one return;</L>
<L>The Par&s;on and the Clerk at Noon were brought,</L>
<L>With Faces full of Fear and Heads of Thought;</L>
<L><PB N="84" REF="93" MS="y">Gravely they enter'd, with a &s;olemn Look,</L>
<L>The Par&s;on held his Breech, the Clerk his Book,</L>
<L>And &s;tep by &s;tep with Caution &s;tar'd around,</L>
<L>Thinking mo&s;t &s;ure 'twas all inchanted Ground.</L>
<L>But fir&s;t they both into the Oven peept,</L>
<L>Thinking, perhaps, it might in there have crept,</L>
<L>But turning to the Cup-board, there did lie,</L>
<L>A nice Plumb-pudding, and a Chri&s;tmas Pie,</L>
<L>That Pu&s;s had in her thieving Tricks thrown down,</L>
<L>And &s;truck with Wonder all the &s;imple Town.</L>
<L>The Par&s;on, with a knavi&s;h Leer and Grin,</L>
<L>Stroak'd with great Sanctity his double Chin.</L>
<L>Cry'd 'twas a Shame &s;uch Pudding &s;hould be lo&s;t,</L>
<L>And in an In&s;tant down his Throat he to&s;t</L>
<L>A Piece that wou'd almo&s;t have choak'd a Hog,</L>
<L>And gave old Sly the Clerk a frienldy Jog.</L>
<L>Who likewi&s;e cry'd, indeed it was a Shame,</L>
<L>And by the Prie&s;t's Example did the &s;ame.</L>
<L>Then both turn'd home with Safety and Content,</L>
<L>And left the Lo&s;ers only to repent;</L>
