<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is the ju&s;t Prerogative of true Greatne&s;s to be univer&s;ally admir'd by all; and one &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it as your Grace, can no more e&s;cape the Tribute of our Prai&s;e and Admiration, than you can cea&s;e to de&s;erve it: Not that 'tis in the Power of any one, or even the Applau&s;e of Multitudes, to reach half your Merit, yet may we be al|low'd, according to the Proportion of our poor Stock, to throw in our Mite; and not be frightned from the Hopes of your Grace's Patronage, by con&s;idering the Unwor|thine&s;s of the Offering; for were none but worthy Offerings made, the Gods them&s;elves wou'd lo&s;e their Sacrifice; and they that de&s;erve mo&s;t our Prai&s;e &s;hou'd have it lea&s;t, becau&s;e 'tis harde&s;t to give them their Due.</P>
<P>And 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, my Lord, this Poem &s;hould find Sanctuary any where but in the Umbrage of your Fa|vour, for the Eyes of all Mankind are &s;o fixt upon your Grace, that 'twou'd be a Di&s;appointment to the Publick. to lay at any other's Door, what is &s;o much your Duee And tho' I hit not a <HI>Wildair</HI> for the Humour of the
<PB REF="5">
Town in my Play, I may boldly &s;ay I have copied the greate&s;t Part of Mankind in the ju&s;t Admiration of your Grace.</P>
<P>Your particular Art, in appearing free, complai&s;ant and conver&s;ible, without quitting a Noble Greatne&s;s proper to your&s;elf, makes us at once approach you with Freedom and with Awe: Your Goodne&s;s, that makes you &s;toop to your Inferiors, lo&s;es nothing by being view'd near at hand, but is the more admir'd for it; and thus we con&s;ider your Grace arriv'd at the Height of Greatne&s;s, without a mortifying Reflection on the Low|ne&s;s of our own Condition; nor does the World envy the truly Great, who by their Goodne&s;s and Affability make Mankind partake of their Felicity.</P>
<P>I may plead Pre&s;cription in Excu&s;e of this Pre&s;ump|tion, and tell how Poets in all Ages have pretended a Right to lay their Works at &s;ome Nobleman's Feet; but I'd rather &s;ubmit to your Grace's Goodne&s;s; for if I have offended, 'tis a Fault of the be&s;t kind, and pro|ceeds from too much Zeal to let the World know how much I am,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_I SHOULD not trouble my Reader with a Preface, if Mr. <HI>Collier</HI> had taught Man|ners to <HI>Masks,</HI> Sen&s;e to <HI>Beaus,</HI> and Good Nature to <HI>Criticks,</HI> as well as Morality to the Stage; the fir&s;t are &s;ure to envy what they can't equal, and condemn what they don't under&s;tand; the <HI>Beaus</HI> u&s;ually take a grea|ter Liberty with our Sex than they wou'd with their own, becau&s;e there's no Fear of drawing a Duel upon their Hands; the latter are a Sort of rude &s;plenatick Men, that &s;eldom commend any thing but what they have had a Hand in. The&s;e &s;narling Sparks were pleas'd to carp at one or two Expre&s;&s;ions, which are &s;poken in 'em A&s;ide by one of the in|ferior Characters in the Drama; and without con&s;idering the Reputation of the Per&s;ons in who&s;e Mouths the Language is put, condemn it &s;trait for loo&s;e and ob&s;cure: Now (with Submi&s;&s;ion to better Judges) I cannot believe that a Prayer-Book &s;hou'd be put into the Hands of a Woman, who&s;e innate Virtue won't &s;ecure her Reputation; nor is it rea&s;onable to expect a Per&s;on, who&s;e Inclinations are always forming Projects to the Di&s;honour of her Husband, &s;hou'd deliver her Commands to her Confident in the Words of a P&s;alm. I heartily wi&s;h that tho&s;e that find fault with the Liberty of my Stile, wou'd be pleas'd to &s;et a Pattern to the Town, by retrenching &s;ome of their Debaucheries, for Mode&s;ty thrives be&s;t by Example. Mode&s;t Language from the truly Virtuous is expected; I mean &s;uch as will neither act ill, nor &s;uffer ill to be acted: It is not enough that <HI>Lucy</HI> &s;ays &s;he's hone&s;t, in having de|nied the Brutal Part; who ever thinks Virtue centers in that, has a wrong Notion of it; no, Virtue is a tender Plant, which cannot live in tainted Ground; Virtue is what the Air
<PB REF="7">
of Flattery cannot bla&s;t, nor the vile &s;ordid Dro&s;s of Gain poi&s;on; and &s;he that can with&s;tand the&s;e two Shocks, may be &s;til'd truly Virtuous. I ask my Reader's Pardon for my Bluntne&s;s, but I hope none of my Sex &s;o qualified will con|demn me for expo&s;ing the Vices of the &s;eeming Religious</P>
<P>I fear there are but too many hit by the Character of Sig|nora <HI>Pizalta;</HI> I wi&s;h, for the &s;ake of the rever&s;e Party, there were fewer, or they better known, &s;ince the malicious World are &s;o apt to judge of Peoples Inclinations by the Com|pany they keep; which is &s;ometimes authentick, but not al|ways an infallible Rule. I &s;hall &s;ay little in Ju&s;tification of the Play, only de&s;ire the Reader to judge impartially, and not condemn it by the Shortne&s;s of its Life, &s;ince the Sea&s;on of the Year never promis'd much better Succe&s;s. It went off with general Applau&s;e; and 'tis the Opinion of &s;ome of our be&s;t Judges, that it only wanted the Addition of good Actors, and a full Town, to have brought me a Sixth Night, there having been wor&s;e Plays within this Twelve-month approv'd of.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I did; I found him in his Study, reading the Lover's Watch, which he &s;wears does not at all agree with his Con&s;titution. He hates Injunctions of Love, like tho&s;e of Penance: For the one, &s;ays he, is no more plea&s;urable to the Body, than the other beneficial to the Soul.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>L. <HI>Piz.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What a fine Gallant I'm like to have with the&s;e Principles! Well&mdash;what did he &s;ay to a Sum|mons from a Woman of my Quality? Did it not make him wi&s;h the Time of A&s;&s;ignation were &s;ooner than the Appointment in the Letter?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>He fir&s;t hum'd over your Billet; and pau&s;ing a while, he de&s;ir'd me to &s;tay for an An&s;wer in a next Room; then coming to me, he ask'd me what Coun|trywoman you were? For, &s;aid he, if &s;he &s;hould prove an old Acquaintance, I would u&s;e her damnably&mdash;But when I and a&s;&s;ur'd him you never &s;aw the Out&s;ide of the&s;e Walls, he began to have that De&s;ire which all Men have to a new Face</P>

rich, covetous, noble <HI>Venetian</HI>; beautiful, young, gene|rous, and of a fair Complexion. He hugg'd me at the&s;e Words, &s;eem'd tran&s;ported with the News, and &s;wore that in Intrigues, a Wife was mo&s;t &s;uitable to his Temper; for, &s;aid he, there's neither Children to fa|ther, nor Honour to repair: and where his Pocket and Liberty are &s;afe, he is contented to venture his Body and Soul,</P>
