then, and not till then, they may be expected to puni&s;h others without <HI>blu&s;hing.</HI></P>
<P>As to our <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> I de&s;ire to be under&s;tood of that particular People, who pretending to be Prote&s;tants, have all along endeavour'd to reduce the Liberties and Religion of this Nation into the Hands of King <HI>James</HI> and his Popi&s;h Powers: Together with &s;uch who enjoy the Peace and Protection of the pre&s;ent Government, and yet abu&s;e and affront the King who procur'd it, and openly profe&s;s their Unea&s;ine&s;s under him: The&s;e, by what&s;oever Names or Titles they are dignified or di&s;tingui&s;h'd, are the People aim'd at: Nor do I di&s;own, but that it is &s;o much the Temper of an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to abu&s;e his Benefactor, that I could be glad to &s;ee it rectified.</P>
<P>They who think I have been guilty of any Error, in expo|&s;ing the Crimes of my own Countrymen to them&s;elves, may among many hone&s;t In&s;tances of the like nature, find the &s;ame thing in Mr. <HI>Cowly,</HI> in his Imitation of the &s;econd Olympick Ode of <HI>Pindar:</HI> His Words are the&s;e;

<P>An ELEGY ON THE AUTHOR OF THE True-Born-<HI>Engli&s;h-Man.</HI>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THO' the&s;e Sheets have been Wrote &s;everal Months, and in a time that &s;eem'd to make them &s;omething more &s;uitable than now: Yet the Occa&s;ion renewing it &s;elf every day, who can refrain from &s;peaking?</P>
<P>Had the &s;cribling World been pleas'd to leave me where they found me, I had left them and <HI>Newgate</HI> both together; and as I am metaphorically Dead, had been effectually &s;o, as to Satyrs and Pamphlets.</P>
<P>'Tis really &s;omething hard, that after all the Mortification they think they have put upon a poor abdicated Author, in their &s;currilous Street Ri|baldry, and Bear Garden U&s;age, &s;ome in Pro&s;e, and &s;ome in tho&s;e terri|ble Lines they call Ver&s;e, they cannot yet be quiet, but whenever any thing comes out that does not plea&s;e them, I come in for a &s;hare in the An&s;wer, whatever I did in the Que&s;tion, every thing they think an Au|thor de&s;erves to be abus'd for, mu&s;t be mine.</P>
<P>Several plentiful Showers of Railery I have quietly &s;ubmitted to, an thought I had a Talent of Patience as large as might &s;erve me in com|mon with my Neighbours, but there is a time when a Man can bear n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> longer, and if the Man is in a little Pa&s;&s;ion, he thinks he ought to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> born with.</P>
<P>I tried Retirement, and bani&s;h'd my &s;elf from the Town: I thought as the Boys us'd to say, 'twas but fair they &s;hould let me alone, while did not meddle with them.</P>
<P>But neither a Country Rece&s;s, any more than a Stone Doublet, on &s;ecure a Man from the Clamour of the Pen.</P>
<P>In the following Sheets I endeavour to &s;tate the Ca&s;e in order to Truce; for &s;hame, Gentlemen, let him alone, why the Man's Dead: 't<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> a Cowardly Trick to beat a Man when he's down, but to fight a Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Man is the Devil.</P>
<P>And with Submi&s;&s;ion, Gentlemen, the Allegory is ju&s;t: for if bei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+tied under Sureties and Penalties not to write, at lea&s;t not to write wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ome People may not like, be not equivalent to being Dead, as to the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> I know not what is.</P>
<P>But how do the&s;e People treat Mankind, that they pretend to Indict<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Man for every thing they plea&s;e, as if they had Power to Read his Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+tenance in Letters, and &s;wear to a Stile as they would to his Face?</P>
<P>'Tis ea&s;ie to prove the Authors of Books, and no Man can be conceal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in &s;uch Ca&s;es; but for a Man to be charged with other Mens Faults, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <HI>has too many of his own,</HI> is a method newly practis'd, and more up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me than any Body; and yet the Grief of this U&s;age does not &s;tick &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon me, but that I may tell my Antagoni&s;ts, <HI>if any think them&s;elv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> de&s;erving that Name,</HI> that they are very welcome to go on their own w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and u&s;e me as they plea&s;e, I &s;hall always be ready to reply, or by my<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+lence let them &s;ee I do not think it worth my while.</P>

<L>IN tho&s;e cold Climates, where the Sun appears</L>

<L>A dreadful Vale lies in a De&s;ert I&s;le,</L>
<L>On which indulgent Heaven did never &s;mile.</L>

<L>Which none without an awful horror &s;ees,</L>
<L>Into its wither'd Arms, depriv'd of Leaves,</L>
<L>Whole Flocks of ill-pre&s;aging Birds receives:</L>
<L>Poi&s;ons are all the Plants the Soil will bear,</L>
<L>And Winter is the only Sea&s;on there.</L>
<L>Millions of Graves cover the &s;pacious Field,</L>
<L>And Springs of Blood a thou&s;and Rivers yield;</L>

<L>Nor have the Evening of my Days perplext.</L>
<L>But by a &s;ilent, and a peaceful Death,</L>
<L>Without a &s;igh Re&s;ign my Aged Breath:</L>
<L>And when committed to the Du&s;t, I'd have</L>
<L>Few Tears, but Frindly drop'd into my Grave.</L>

'Tis the la&s;t Thing I &s;hould de&s;ire.</P>
<P>My Aim is of another &s;ort, and I am abundantly Rewarded, if have been able to Contribute any thing to the Publick Service, by D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tecting the Principles and Practices of this <HI>New Party,</HI> who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> A&s;&s;um'd to them&s;elves a very Specious Name and Character, and wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be thought the only Patriots of their Country.

<P>It is indeed the ju&s;t Prerogative of the Throne to be approach'd with Humility and Petitions, even where the Subjects have Grievances to Repre&s;ent. But I know of no &s;uch Homage due to its Officers. Nor can I yet be convinced, that it is an Arrogant Pre&s;umption in private Per&s;ons (as &s;ome wou'd have it) to examine and cen&s;ure the Actions of Publick Mini&s;ters, who (&s;ay they) being neare&s;t the Helm, are con&s;equently best able to judge of what ought, and ought not to be done; whereas Men in a Remote Sphere, and at a di&s;tance, cannot po&s;&s;ibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nter into the Councils of State, and mu&s;t therefore determine ra&s;hly, and without knowledge. This is a Doctrine nece&s;&s;ary to be Preach'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p in De&s;potick and Arbitrary Governments, where all is Tran&s;acted in the Cabinet, where the Will and Choice of the Prince gives a San|ction to his Creatures, and cannot be controverted without Trea&s;on. But in a mixt and limited Monarchy, where the deepe&s;t Re&s;orts of Policy and Turns of Government are in &s;ome mea&s;ure known to Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f Rank and Condition, and where a right of Impeachment is lodged in the Hou&s;e of Commons, it can never be maintained; for that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rou'd de&s;troy the Con&s;titution, and render the Accu&s;ation of Great Of|ficers, tho' never &s;o Guilty, Impracticable. But I would not here be &s;uppos'd to countenance that Scandalous Principle <HI>of Appealing to the Mob.</HI> I leave &s;uch Maxims to the <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Friends</HI> of a <HI>certain Lawyer,</HI> who at the <HI>Ob&s;ervator's</HI> Tryal had the <HI>Impu|dence</HI> (as the <HI>Attorney-General</HI> very ju&s;tly called it) to in&s;inuate that <HI>the Crown was in the Di&s;po&s;al of the People.</HI> Nor wou'd I be thought in the least to detract from the Prerogative, which no Man living has in higher Veneration than my &s;elf. For I think it never violated but by a profligate abandon'd Nation, and I wi&s;h, for the Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Name, our Annals had Recorded no In|&s;tances of that kind.</P>
<P>But after all this <HI>New-Moderation Policy</HI> is not more pernici|ous and tending to the De&s;truction of the Government, than it is Ab|&s;ur'd and Ridiculous in it &s;elf. For how can Men of &V;nder&s;tanding pretend to look Two Ways at once, to blow Hot and Cold, and fancy that every Body does not &s;ee thro' the pitiful Di&s;gui&s;e and Artifice? They call them&s;elves True Sons of the Church, and yet make no &s;cruple of oppo&s;ing a <HI>Bill,</HI> which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for its Pre&s;ervation; becau&s;e for&s;ooth it is offered at an un&s;ea&s;onable time; as if it was not as &s;ea&s;onable to make whole&s;om Laws, as to engage in a just and
<PB REF="234">
Honourable War for the Security of our Constitution; Can they hope for a better Opportunity than the Reign we now enjoy? They would be thought great Favourers of the <HI>Church Party,</HI> when upon all Oc|ca&s;ions they take care to Di&s;countenance them, and Encourage only the <HI>Profe&s;t Enemies</HI> of Church and State, under a &s;hallow Pretence, that they are a numerous and formidable Body of Men, and ought there|fore to be preferr'd to Places of Honour and Profit, that they may not grow Mutinous and complain of <HI>Per&s;ecution;</HI> which methinks &s;hould rather be a strong Argument for u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible Means to &s;uppre&s;s &s;uch Turbulent A&s;piring Spirits. Nay, &s;o Tender are they of their <HI>DIS|SENTING BRETHREN,</HI> that I am told it has lately been deliver'd as Law by a <HI>Great Man</HI> in <HI>W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;r-Hall, that a Notorious Perjur'd Vagabond, with Two Wives at once, be+ing po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a Separate Congregation, tho' without any Li|cence, or Legal Qualification to Preach to them, &s;hall for that Rea&s;on only be exempt from the late Act for li&s;ting Vagrants.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s I cannot imagine how they would define it, or what <HI>Mo|deration</HI> according to the&s;e Practices is. The <HI>Logicians</HI> have &s;tated no <HI>Medium</HI> that I know of, between Truth and Fal&s;hood, nor the <HI>Morali&s;ts</HI> any between Virtue and Vice: Every Propo&s;ition and Prin|ciple mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall under one of the&s;e Heads.</P>
<P>There is no need of a Prophetick Spirit to fore&s;ee, That they will ren|der them&s;elves Odious, and cannot Sub&s;i&s;t long. I heartily Pity &s;ome young Gentlemen, who are unwarily drawn in; for they will fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> them&s;elves Deceiv'd by their <HI>Crafty Leader,</HI> and cannot expect to be receiv'd by their old Friends again. 'Tis much to be Lamented that a late <HI>Great Character</HI> Stain'd the latter part of his Life.&mdash; but <HI>De Mortuis nil ni&s;i bonum.</HI></P>
<P>I hope &s;ome Paragraphs in the clo&s;e of his Poem will at lea&s;t prove that I have not writ with Partiality, but have equally commende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Merit whereever I found it, without any regard to a Party.</P>

<HEAD>A LETTER to a Gentleman in the Univer&s;ity.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS comes to Congratulate You on the agree|able News of &s;ome late extraordinary Succe&s;&s;es, which have ble&s;s'd the Arms of Her Maje&s;ty, and Her Allies. I leave you to the Printed Papers for a particular Account of tho&s;e Actions, which have &s;urpriz'd the World; and, we hope, given the la&s;t Stroke to the langui&s;hing Power of the Common Ene|my of <HI>Europe.</HI> They will furni&s;h noble Topics for the Wits of an &V;niver&s;ity, like yours, who can embelli&s;h (if that can be done) the Glories of a <HI>Female Reign</HI> with a ju&s;ter Sublimity of Ver&s;e, than what you will find in the following Performance, which was written &s;everal Months ago, and not run over with a ha&s;ty Negligence. The Ode, from whence I take my Hint, is accounted by &s;ome Critics not inferior to the <HI>4</HI>th of the &s;ame Book, which begins thus,
<Q>Qualem mini&s;trum fulminis alitem, &amp;c.</Q>
And was written in Complement to <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> on oc|ca&s;ion of a famous Victory gain'd by <HI>Tiberius,</HI> as this, which I have aim'd to imitate, was written on the Prai&s;e of <HI>Claudius Nero.</HI> I need not inform Men of your Reading and Letters what occa&s;ion'd both. The Poet, as he does in almo&s;t all his Odes, has &s;hewn a peculiar Artfulne&s;s and Elegance, and turns all the Panegyric on the Emperor (who was not in the Action) with <HI>Te concilium, &amp; tuos Praebente Divos.</HI> If You ask wherein I have trod in the Steps of <HI>Horace,</HI> You will find it in the Beginning. I have only kept him in view, and u&s;ed him only where he was &s;erviceable
<PB REF="336">
to my De&s;ign. He took the &s;ame liberty with <HI>Alcaeus,</HI> as appears from &s;ome Fragments of that <HI>Greek</HI> Lyriac, quoted by <HI>Athenaeus.</HI> In my Digre&s;&s;ions and Tran&s;itions I have taken care to play always in &s;ight, and make eve|ry one of them contribute to my main De&s;ign. This was the Way of <HI>Pindar,</HI> to read whom, according to <HI>Rapin,</HI> will give a truer Idea of the Ode, than all the Rules and Reflections of the be&s;t Critics. I will not pretend to have div'd into him over Head and Ears, but I have endeavour'd to have made my &s;elf not the greate&s;t Stranger to his Manner of Writing; which generally con&s;i&s;ts in the Dignity of the Sentiments, and an ele|gant Variety, which makes the Reader ri&s;e up with greater Satisfaction than he &s;at down. And that which affects the Mind in Compo&s;itions of any &s;ort, will never be di&s;agreeable to a Gentleman of Ingenuity and Judg|ment. I have avoided Turns, as thinking that they de|ba&s;e the Loftine&s;s of the Ode. You will ea&s;ily perceive whether I have reach'd that <HI>acer Spiritus &amp; Vis,</HI> re|commended by <HI>Horace,</HI> as the Genius of Poetry. Whe|ther you will call the following Lines a <HI>Pindaric</HI> Ode, or Irregular Stanza's, gives me no Di&s;turbance: For however the &s;eeming Wildne&s;s of this &s;ort of Ver&s;e ought to be re&s;train'd, the <HI>Strophe, Anti&s;trophe,</HI> &amp;c. will never bear in Engli&s;h, and it would &s;hew a &s;trange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Debauchery in our Ta&s;te, if it &s;hould, as may be wit|ne&s;&s;ed by the &s;ervile Imitation of the Dactyles and Spondees u&s;ed by Sir <HI>P. Sidney.</HI> But to make an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of this tedious Epi&s;tle; you will &s;ee thro' the Whole, that Her MAJESTY is the Chief Heroine of the Ode; and the Moral, at the End, &s;hews the &s;olid Glo|ries of a Reign which is not founded on a pretended Ju&s;tice, or Criminal Magnanimity.</P>

<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the EARL of <HI>ABINGDON,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Commands, with which You honour'd me &s;ome Months ago, are now perform'd: They had been &s;ooner; but betwixt ill Health, &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s, and many Troubles, I was forc'd to deferr them till this time. <HI>Ovid,</HI> going to this Bani&s;h|ment, and Writing from on Ship-board to his Friends, ex|cus'd the Faults of his Poetry by his Misfortunes; and told them, that good Ver&s;es never flow, but from a &s;erene and compos'd Spirit. Wit, which is a kind of <HI>Mercury,</HI> with Wings fa&s;ten'd to his Head and Heels, can fly but &s;lowly, in a damp Air. I therefore cho&s;e rather to Obey You late, than ill: if at lea&s;t I am capable of writing any thing&punc; at any time, which is worthy Your Peru&s;al and Your Patronage. I cannot &s;ay that I have e&s;cap'd from a Shipwreck; but have only gain'd a Rock by hard &s;wimming; where I may pan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a while and gather Breath: For the Doctors give me a &s;ad A&s;&s;urance that my Di&s;ea&s;e never took its leave of any Man, but with a purpo&s;e to return. However, my Lord, I have laid hold on the Interval, and manag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the &s;mall Stock which Age has left me, to the be&s;t Advantage, in performing this incon&s;ide|rable Service to my Lady's Memory. We, who are Prie&s;ts of <HI>Apollo,</HI> have not the In&s;piration when we plea&s;e; but mu&s;t wait till the God comes ru&s;hing on us, and invades us with a Fury, which we are not able to re&s;i&s;t: which gives us double Strength while the Fit continues, and leaves us langui&s;hing and &s;pent, at its Departure. Let me not &s;eem to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t, my Lord; for I have really felt it on this Occa&s;ion; and prophe|cy'd beyond my natural Power. Let me add, and hope to be believ'd, that the Excellency of the Subject contributed much to the Happine&s;s of the Execution: And that the weight of thirty Years was taken off me, while I was writing. I &s;wom with the Tide, and the Water under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was buoyant. The Reader will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve that I was tran&s;ported, by the Multitude and Variety of my Similitudes; which are generally the Product of a luxuriant Fancy; and the Wantonne&s;s of Wit. Had I call'd in my Judgment to my A&s;&s;istance, I had certainly retrench'd many of them. But I defend them not; let them pa&s;s for beautiful Faults among&s;t the better &s;ort of Criticks. For the whole Poem, though writ|ten in that which they call Heroick Ver&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Pind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rick Nature, as well in the Thought as the Expre&s;&s;ion; and as &s;uch, requires the &s;ame Grains of Allowance for it. It was intended, as your Lord&s;hip &s;ees in the Title, not for an Elegy, but a Panegyrick. A kind of Apotheo&s;is, indeed; if a Heathen Word may be applyed to a Chri&s;tian U&s;e. And on all Occa&s;ions of Prai&s;e, if we take the Ancients for our Patterns, we are
<PB N="4" REF="439">
bound by Pre&s;cription to employ the Magnificence of Words, and the force of Figures, to adorn the Sublimity of Thoughts. <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Grecian</HI> Orators, and <HI>Cicero,</HI> and the younger <HI>Pliny,</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> have left us their Precedents for our &s;ecurity: For I think I need not mention the inimitable <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">indar,</HI> who &s;tretches on the&s;e Pinnions out of &s;ight, and is carried upward, as it were, into another World.</P>
<P>This at lea&s;t, my Lord, I may ju&s;tly plead, that if I have not per|form'd &s;o well as I think I have, yet I have us'd my be&s;t Endeavours to excel my &s;elf. One Di&s;advantage I have had, which is, never to have known, or &s;een my Lady: And to draw the Lineaments of her Mind, from the De&s;cription which I have receiv'd from others, is for a Painter to &s;et him&s;elf at work without the living Original before him. Which the more beautiful it is, will be &s;o much the more difficult for him to conceive; when he has only a relation give him, of &s;uch and &s;uch Fea|tures by an Acquaintance or a Friend; without the Nice Touches which give the best Re&s;emblance&punc; and make the Graces of the Picture. Every Arti&s;t is apt enough to flatter him&s;elf, (and I among&s;t the re&s;t) that that their own ocular Ob&s;ervations, would have di&s;cover'd more Perfe|ctions, at lea&s;t others, than have been deliver'd to them: Though I have receiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d mine from the be&s;t hands, that is, from Per&s;ons who neither want a just Under&s;tanding of my Lady's Worth, nor a due Veneration for her Memory.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Donn</HI> the greatest Wit, though not the greate&s;t Poet of our Nation, acknowledges, that he had never &s;een Mrs. <HI>Drury,</HI> whom he has made immortal in his admirable Anniver&s;aries; I have had the &s;ame fortune; though I have no &s;ucceeded to the &s;ame Genius. How|ever, I have follow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d his Foot&s;teps in the De&s;ign of his Panegyrick, which was to rai&s;e an Emul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tion in the living, to Copy out the Example of the dead. And therefore it was, that I once intended to have call'd this Poem, the Pattern: And though on a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cond Con&s;ideration, I chang'd the Title into the Name of that Illustrious Per&s;on, yet the De&s;ign con|tinues, and <HI>Eleonora</HI> is &s;till the Pattern of Charity, Devotion, and Humility; of the be&s;t Wife, the be&s;t Mother, and the be&s;t of Friends.</P>
<P>And now, my Lord, though I have endeavour'd to an&s;wer Your Com|mands, yet I could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;wer it to the World, nor to my Con&s;cience, if I gave not Your Lord&s;hip my Te&s;timony of being the be&s;t Husband now living: I &s;ay my Te&s;timony only: For the Prai&s;e of it, is given You by Your &s;elf. They who de&s;pi&s;e the Rules of Vertue both in their Practice and their Morals, will think this a very trivial Commendation. But I think i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">culiar Happine&s;s of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Abingdon,</HI> to have been &s;o truly lov'd by you, while &s;he was living, and &s;o gratef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly ho|nour'd, after &s;he was dead.

and forgot with ea&s;e. But you have di&s;tingui&s;h'd your &s;elf from ordi|nary Lovers, by a real, and la&s;ting Grief for the Deceas'd. And by en|deavouring to rai&s;e for her, the mo&s;t durable Monument, which is that of Ver&s;e. And &s;o it would have prov'd, if the Workman had been equal to the Work; and your Choice of the Artificer, as happy as your De&s;ign. Yet&punc; as <HI>Phidias</HI> when he had made the Statue of <HI>Minerva,</HI> cou'd not forbear to ingrave his own Name, as Author of the Piece: &s;o give me leave to hope, that by &s;ub&s;cribing mine to this Poem, I may live by the Godde&s;s, and tran&s;mit my Name to Po&s;terity by the Memory of Hers. 'Tis no Flattery to a&s;&s;ure Your Lor&s;hip, that &s;he is remember'd in the pre&s;ent Age, by all who have had the Honour of her Conver&s;ation and Acquain|tance. And that I have never been in any Company &s;ince the News of her Death was fir&s;t brought me, where they have not ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ol'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> her Vir|tues; and even &s;poken the &s;ame things of her in Pro&s;e, which I have done in Ver&s;e.</P>
<P>I therefore think my &s;elf oblig'd to thank Your Lord&s;hip for the Com|mi&s;&s;ion which You have given me: How I have acquitted my &s;elf of it, mu&s;t be left to the Opinion of the World, in &s;pight of any Prote&s;tation, which I can enter again&s;t the pre&s;ent Age, as Incompetent or Corrupt Judges. For my Comfort they are but <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> and as &s;uch, If they Think ill of me to Day, they are incon&s;tant enough, to Think well of me to Morrow. And after all, I have not much to thank my Fortune that I was born among&s;t them. The Good of both Sexes are &s;o few&punc; in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngland,</HI> that they &s;tand like Exceptions again&s;t General Rules: And though one of them has de&s;erv'd a greater Commendation, than I cou'd give her, they have taken care, that I &s;hou'd not tire my Pen, with frequent Ex|erci&s;e on the like Subjects&punc; that Prai&s;es, like Taxes, &s;hou'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be appropri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ted; and left almo&s;t as Individual as the Per&s;on. They &s;ay my Talent is Satyr; if it be &s;o, 'tis a fruitful Age; and there is an extraordinary Crop to gather. But a &s;ingle Hand is in&s;ufficient for &s;uch a Harve&s;t: They have &s;own the Dragons Teeth them&s;elves; and 'tis but ju&s;t they &s;hou'd reap each other in Lampoons. You, my Lord, who have the Cha|racter of Honour, though 'tis not my Happine&s;s to know You, may &s;tand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ide, with the &s;mall Remainders of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility, truly &s;uch, and unhurt your &s;elves, behold the mad Combat.

You &s;ee, I have di&s;abled my &s;elf, like an Elected Speaker of the Hou&s;e; yet like him I have un|dertaken the Charge; and find the Burden &s;ufficiently recompenc'd by the Honour. Be pleas'd to accept of the&s;e my unworthy Labours, this Paper Monument; and let her Pious Memory, which I am &s;ure is Sacred to You, not only Plead the Pardon of my many Faults, but gain me your Protection, which is ambitiou&s;ly &s;ought by,</P>

<L>Ri&s;e in their turn, and int he Zodiack run.</L>
<L>Evern in Motion; now 'tis Faith a&s;cends,</L>
<L>Now Hope, now Charity, that upward tends,</L>
<L>And downwards with diffu&s;ive Good, de&s;cends.</L>
<L>As in Perfumes compos'd with Art and Co&s;t,</L>
<L>'Tis hard to &s;ay what Scent is uppermo&s;t;</L>
<L>Nor this part Musk or Civet can we call,</L>
<L>Or Amber, but a rich Re&s;ult of all;</L>
<L>So, &s;he was all a &s;weet; who&s;e ev'ry part,</L>
<L>In due proportion mix'd, proclaim'd the Maker's Art.</L>
<L>No &s;ingle Vertue we cou'd mo&s;t commend;</L>
<L>Whether the Wife, the Mother, or the Friend;</L>
<L>For &s;he was all, in that &s;upreme degree,</L>

<L>We &s;hifted our Linen, and whip'd on our Cloaths,</L>
<L>And powder'd our Wigs like a couple of <HI>Beaus,</HI></L>
<L>Then quitted our Lodging till Night, with de&s;ign,</L>

<HEAD>TO THE KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFter the delivery of Your Royal Father's Per&s;on into the hands of the Army, I undertaking to the Queen Mother, that I would find &s;ome means to get acce&s;s to him &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;end me, and by the help of <HI>Hugh Peters</HI> I got my admittance, and coming well in&s;tructed from the Queen (his Maje&s;ty having been long kept in the dark) he was plea&s;ed to di&s;cour&s;e very freely with me of the whole &s;tate of his Affairs: But, Sir, I will not launch into a Hi&s;tory, in&s;tead of an Epi&s;tle. One morning waiting on him at <HI>Cau&s;ham,</HI> &s;miling upon me, he &s;aid he could tell me &s;ome News of my &s;elf, which was, that he had &s;een &s;ome Ver&s;es of mine the Evening before (being tho&s;e to Sir <HI>Richard Fan&s;haw</HI>) and asking me when I made them, I told him two or three years &s;ince; he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that having never &s;een them before, He was afraid I had written them &s;ince my return into <HI>England,</HI> and though he liked them well, He would advi&s;e me to write no more, alledging, that when men are young, and have little el&s;e to do, they might vent the overflowings of their Fancy that way; but when they were thought fit for more &s;erious Employments, if they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in that cour&s;e, it would look as if they minded not the way to any better.</P>
<P>Whereupon I &s;tood corrected as long as I had the honour to wait upon him, and at his departure from <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> he was plea&s;ed to com|mand me to &s;tay privately at <HI>London,</HI> to &s;end to him and receive from him all his Letters from and to all his Corre&s;pondents at home and abroad, and I was furni&s;h'd with nine &s;everal Cyphers in order to it: Which tru&s;t I performed with great &s;afety, to the per&s;ons with whom we corre&s;ponded; but about nine months after being di&s;covered by their knowledge of Mr. <HI>Cowley's</HI> Hand I happily e&s;caped both for my &s;elf, and tho&s;e that held corre&s;pondence with me; that time war too hot and bu&s;ie for &s;uch idle &s;peculations, but after I had the good fortune to wait upon Your Maje&s;ty in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> You were plea&s;ed &s;ometimes to give me Arguments to divert and put off the evil hours of our Bani&s;hment, which now and then fell not &s;hort of Your Maje&s;ty's expectation.</P>
<P>After, when Your Maje&s;ty departing from St. <HI>Germans</HI> to <HI>Jer&s;y,</HI> was plea&s;ed freely (without my asking) to confer upon me that place wherein I have now the honour to &s;erve You, I then gave over Poetical Line,

<L>No longer then within his Banks he dwells,</L>
