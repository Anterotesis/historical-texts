<L>Their heat to temper, and to &s;ooth the &s;oul,</L>
<L>In &s;weeter notes Love &s;ounds his &s;oft alarms,</L>
<L>And Beauty &s;tands revealed in all her charms;</L>
<L>Awed by her look their terrours they re&s;ign,</L>
<L>Compo&s;e their rage, and own the form divine.</L>
<L>What hopes, what fears, what mixed emotions ri&s;e!</L>
<L>What plea&s;ing angui&s;h now the bo&s;om tries!</L>
<L>Ble&s;t raptures! never to be twice enjoyed,</L>
<L>When all is novel, and the &s;en&s;e uncloyed,</L>
<L>E'er blooming youth, uncon&s;cious of alloy,</L>
<L>Has proved the fallacy of human joy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With love, and earlier oft than love, de&s;ire</L>
<L>Wakes in the &s;oul, a loo&s;e ungoverned fire,</L>
<L>That quick thro' all the vital frame obtains,</L>
<L>Flames in the heart, and revels in the veins;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="20">
Dethrones fair wi&s;dom, and a&s;&s;aults the &s;hrine</L>
<L>Where dwell the virtues, and the graces &s;hine.</L>
<L>Soft is the voice, per&s;ua&s;ive are the &s;miles</L>
<L>With which the mercenary fair beguiles:</L>
<L>How bright the dome that wooes the pa&s;&s;ing eye!</L>
<L>How &s;weet the odours which around it fly!</L>
<L>Airs too, Eolian airs &s;alute the ear,</L>
<L>And happine&s;s, and heaven it&s;elf &s;eems near&mdash;</L>
<L>Turn generous youth, nor let the love-tuned lay</L>
<L>Of Thais lure thy heedle&s;s &s;teps a&s;tray,</L>
<L>Fly, fly the &s;orcere&s;s, fly her tainted charms,</L>
<L>Remor&s;e, di&s;ea&s;e, and death are in her arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But other powers, &s;hould wily Thais fail,</L>
<L>More fatal oft the youthful &s;en&s;e a&s;&s;ail.</L>
<L>Gay blooming, fre&s;h with never fading green,</L>
<L>Here Bacchus opes the jocund nightly &s;cene,</L>
<L>Through the glad circle breaths his &s;ocial fires,</L>
<L>Cheers with fal&s;e hopes, and fills with vain de&s;ires.</L>
<L>Quick flies the je&s;t, with laughter loud repayed,</L>
<L>And many a chorus echoes through the &s;hade;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="21">
Till flu&s;hed, and pregnant with the purple god,</L>
<L>As when of old the potent my&s;tick rod,</L>
<L>Waved high in air, with frenzy fired the throng,</L>
<L>And the loud I'o &s;welled the barbarous &s;ong,</L>
<L>At once they rou&s;e, at once their &s;houts a&s;cend,</L>
<L>And war and tumult o'er the town impend.</L>
<L>Unhappy wanderer! doomed to certain woes,</L>
<L>Who&s;e &s;teps the&s;e &s;ons of Belial now oppo&s;e;</L>
<L>Thrice haple&s;s he, the youth who&s;e fairer fame</L>
<L>Such wild exce&s;&s;es &s;oil with early &s;hame!</L>
<L>In &s;ome lewd quarrel, haply not his own,</L>
<L>This fatal night his force is overthrown;</L>
<L>Struck with ba&s;e fears his fal&s;e a&s;&s;ociates fly,</L>
<L>And leave him in the inglorious cau&s;e to die.</L>
<L>Ah what avail him now the joys of wine,</L>
<L>His &s;ocial merits, and his form divine?</L>
<L>Sealed are tho&s;e lips, for ever mute that tongue</L>
<L>On which this morn &s;uch &s;weet per&s;ua&s;ion hung;</L>
<L>The &s;miles, the graces, every charm is fled,</L>
<L>And mortal palene&s;s &s;ettles in their &s;tead.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="22">
In vain for him the fond expectant &s;ire</L>
<L>Counts the &s;low clock, and cheers the &s;lumbering fire;</L>
<L>In vain the anxious matron mounts on high,</L>
<L>Looke forth, and often heaves the boding &s;igh,</L>
<L>Far from her aid a bleeding cor&s;e he lies,</L>
<L>And never more &s;hall ble&s;s a parent's eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus here while various ills from Bacchus flow,</L>
<L>Mark well the clo&s;e approach of yonder foe;</L>
<L>Dark &s;on of &s;tratagem, who lives by &s;poils,</L>
<L>Works in the &s;hade, and nightly &s;preads his toils.</L>
<L>Dete&s;ted mon&s;ter! whom no tears can bend,</L>
<L>At war with all, to all a &s;eeming friend;</L>
<L>Who quotes the maxims of the truly wi&s;e,</L>
<L>And feigns to damn the very art he plies;</L>
<L>Who hugs him in the &s;poil his frauds have won,</L>
<L>And turns to laughter tho&s;e he has undone.</L>
<L>See how to yonder Youth he winds his way,</L>
<L>Calls up his wiles, and meditates the prey:</L>
<L>Short is the &s;trife with &s;uch unequal foes,</L>
<L>At every game a wealthy manor goes;</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="23">
Flocks, herds, and fields are lo&s;t beyond recall,</L>
<L>And one fine&s;&s;e deprives the youth of all.</L>
<L>What &s;hall he do? An hopele&s;s wretch he &s;tands,</L>
<L>No longer now the lord of many lands;</L>
<L>Unhou&s;ed, unpitied, forced to beg for bread,</L>
<L>Perhaps from tho&s;e his former fortunes fed,</L>
<L>Or in the caverns of a jail to lie,</L>
<L>There mourn his folly, and by famine die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The&s;e are the changes nature now unfolds,</L>
<L>And thus her favourite &s;on his progre&s;s holds;</L>
<L>Here range the virtues, there the vices &s;tand,</L>
<L>He weighs their worth, but with unequal hand;</L>
<L>Warped in his choice the balance he &s;u&s;pends,</L>
<L>And &s;pite of odds the vicious &s;cale de&s;cends.</L>
<L>Now Vanity her playful part a&s;&s;umes,</L>
<L>And tricks him out in all her gaye&s;t plumes;</L>
<L>South, Ea&s;t, and We&s;t are &s;ought with curious care,</L>
<L>And Boreas wafts the fluttering youth a &s;hare.</L>
<L>For him the inventive arti&s;t hourly plies,</L>
<L>Views every flower, and blends the varied dyes:</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="24">
He raves of fa&s;hions, gives the important rule</L>
<L>Which guides the mode of every mimick fool;</L>
<L>Smiles, &s;impers, to&s;&s;es his fanta&s;tick head,</L>
<L>And &s;trikes in thought each haple&s;s fair one dead.</L>
<L>Turn to the in&s;ect, youth, that art &s;o vain,</L>
<L>Then, if thou can'&s;t, thy folly &s;till maintain;</L>
<L>Dre&s;&s;ed by the &s;ummer &s;un from earth he &s;prings,</L>
<L>Opes his gay downs, and &s;preads his gold-drop'd wings,</L>
<L>Turns every beauty to the &s;unny ray,</L>
<L>And winnows with &s;oft wing his ea&s;y way,</L>
<L>Till from the North a &s;udden bla&s;t ari&s;e,</L>
<L>Down drops the painted flutterer, and dies:</L>
<L>Even &s;uch the frail condition, &s;uch the &s;pan</L>
<L>Which circum&s;cribes the little race of man,</L>
<L>Offspring of earth, that blooms but to decay,</L>
<L>The gaudy, glittering in&s;ect of a day.</L>

<L>Behold him now adrift, without a guide,</L>
<L>Borne down where plea&s;ure rolls her rapid tide;</L>
<L>Erroneous flood, that wide it's wave expands,</L>

<L>Pre&s;s to the &s;hores, or urge the deep along!</L>
<L>Nor youth alone, all ages, all degrees,</L>
<L>Female, and male the eye of fancy &s;ees:</L>

<L>By thee &s;educed the warriour doffs his arms,</L>
<L>And &s;ells his laurels for thy &s;ofter charms;</L>
<L>The merchant too, caught by thy wily train,</L>
<L>Foregoes the rich, the golden hour of gain:</L>
<L>Thee the fond youth his brighter genius &s;tyles,</L>
<L>Hangs on thy looks, and lives but in thy &s;miles;</L>
<L>Ble&s;t youth indeed, if in her &s;miles &s;incere</L>

<L>Ah much misjudging, to the future blind,</L>
<L>Who thinks that plea&s;ure always will be kind;</L>

Then when &s;he &s;ooths, when mo&s;t her charms delight,</L>
<L>Even then &s;he meditates di&s;hone&s;t flight,</L>
<L>Bids her fal&s;e brea&s;t with well-feigned raptures heave,</L>
