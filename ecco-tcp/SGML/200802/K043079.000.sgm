<P>AS you prevailed upon your friends to build the Circus, &s;olely with a view to &s;erve me; as you have repeatedly promi&s;ed that place &s;hould make me inde|pendent for life; and declared how happy you were to find an opportunity of e&s;&s;entially a&s;&s;i&s;ting an old friend, who&s;e abilities you had an opinion of, and from who&s;e acquaintance you received

<HEAD>The Eque&s;trian Creed.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER would belong to the Royal Circus, before all things it is nece&s;|&s;ary that he hold the proprietors infallible.</P>
<P>Which infallibility, unle&s;s he keep ab&s;olute and unequivocal, without doubt he &s;hall pe|ri&s;h in the King's Bench.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this was written Mr. Dibdin has been ad|ditionally per&s;ecuted, by being removed with a Ha|beas to the Fleet.</NOTE></P>
<P>And the proprietors infallibility is this, that we flatter one per&s;on in five, and five in one, neither confounding the per&s;on, or di|viding their committees; for there is one per&s;on of the city, another of St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital, another of Newmarket, another of the Court, and another of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall.</P>
<P>But the merchant, the &s;urgeon, the &s;port&s;|man, the courtier, and the attorney is all one: the &s;tupidity is equal, the ab&s;urdity eternal.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="14">Such as the merchant is, &s;o is the &s;urgeon; and &s;uch is the &s;port&s;man, the courtier, and the attorney.</P>
<P>The merchant &s;tupid, the &s;urgeon &s;tupid, the &s;port&s;man &s;tupid, the courtier &s;tupid, and the attorney &s;tupid.</P>
<P>The merchant ab&s;urd, the &s;urgeon ab&s;urd, the &s;port&s;man ab&s;urd, the courtier ab&s;urd, the attorney ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>The merchant incomprehen&s;ible, the &s;ur|geon incomprehen&s;ible, the courtier incom|prehen&s;ible, the attorney incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>And yet not only one is &s;tupid, they are all &s;tupid.</P>
<P>Neither is only one ab&s;urd, or one incom|prehen&s;ible; they are all ab&s;urd, and all in|comprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e the merchant is a committee, the &s;urgeon a committee, the &s;port&s;man a committee, the courtier a committee, the at|torney a committee;</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="15">And yet there are not five committees, but one committee.</P>
<P>So the merchant is manager, the &s;urgeon manager, the &s;port&s;man manager, the courtier manager, the attorney manager;</P>
<P>And yet there are not five managers, but one manager.</P>
<P>So the merchant is a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, the &s;ur|geon a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, the &s;port&s;man a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, the courtier a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, the attor|ney a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter;</P>
<P>Yet are there not five mu&s;ic-ma&s;ters, but one mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>For, as we are compelled by Common Sen&s;e to acknowledge every per&s;on to be what he is,</P>
<P>So are we forbidden by the Eque&s;trian Creed to acknowledge any proprietor but for what he is not.</P>
<P><PB N="xiv" REF="16" MS="y">The merchant is no committee, for he is never in committee-room.</P>
<P>The &s;urgeon is no committee, for he &s;igns re&s;olutions without agreeing to them.</P>
<P>The &s;port&s;man is no committee, for were he to &s;ign, he could not under&s;tand the re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>The courtier is no committee, he not being a proprietor, but the repre&s;entative of a pro|prietor.</P>
<P>The attorney is not a committee, he being the trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the merchant is not a manager, but an accomptant.</P>
<P>Neither is the &s;urgeon a manager, but a hor&s;e-racer.</P>
<P>Neither is the &s;port&s;man a manager, but a cock-fighter.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="17">Nor is the courtier a manager, but an ele|gant lounger.</P>
<P>Neither is the attorney a manager, but a writer of tautology.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e the merchant is no mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, he having no ear.</P>
<P>Neither is the &s;urgeon a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, he having no ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Neither is the &s;port&s;man a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, he preferring a Jew's harp to a Cremona.</P>
<P>Neither is the courtier a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, but a <HI>Dilletanti.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is the attorney a mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, he having no harmony in his &s;oul.</P>
<P>Yet are they all committees, all managers, and all mu&s;ic-ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>And in this concern none is before or after the other; none is greater or le&s;s than the other.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="18" MS="y">But the whole five proprietors are equally &s;tupid, equally ab&s;urd, equally incomprehen|&s;ible, and equally infallible.</P>
<P>Yet has each a better fortune than the other; each is a better merchant, &s;urgeon, &s;port&s;man, courtier, and attorney, than the other; and each is a better committee-man, manager, and mu&s;ic-ma&s;ter, than the other.</P>
<P>Al&s;o each is a better fiddler, a better painter, a better carpenter, a better hor&s;e-rider, and a better figure-dancer, than the other.</P>
<P>Each is ignorant, yet each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all kind of knowledge.</P>
<P>Each is black and each is white, each is vulgar and each is genteel.</P>
<P>So that in all things as afore&s;aid, the pro|prietors mu&s;t be flattered; their folly mu&s;t be flattered, their vanity mu&s;t be flattered; and above all, their flatterers mu&s;t flatter them|&s;elves with a belief of their infallibility.</P>
<P>And he who would belong to the Circus, mu&s;t thus think of the proprietors.</P>

<HEAD>THE ROYAL CIRCUS EPITOMIZED.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a man has received boundle&s;s obligations from the public, when the labours of his life have been at their de|votion, and they have favoured him in return with the ample recompence of profit and re|putation, he ought to view his own intentions with the nice&s;t circum&s;pection, and to be convinced he can &s;afely determine to keep truth in con&s;tant view, before he officiou&s;ly calls on the world to judge of his private concerns.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="20">Upon this ground I am willing to &s;tand. I have pre&s;ented the public at different pe|riods with nearly &s;ixty pieces <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See la&s;t page.</NOTE> of which I am author and compo&s;er; be&s;ide the mu&s;ic of eight or ten others, and out of all tho&s;e only three have been un&s;ucce&s;sful. Thus, the flattering applau&s;e with which my efforts have been indulgently favoured, would &s;tamp me unworthy of future notice, if in the pre&s;ent relation I dared to obtrude any thing fal&s;e or futile. The candid public has ever had a pride in taking up the cau&s;e of an injured in|dividual; no man can more truly an&s;wer that de&s;cription than my&s;elf. I am inhumanly and cau&s;ele&s;sly per&s;ecuted; hunted from my li|berty, and &s;u&s;pended from holding a legal right, for no other fault than having relied upon the &s;uppo&s;ed honour of a &s;et of men who were &s;trangers to that word. I am now irritated, by calumny and oppre&s;&s;ion, to that appeal which it is peculiarly my province to make. The laws will realize the truth of my claim, but it is the public I proudly a&s;k to decide upon the integrity of my intentions.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="21">The nece&s;&s;ity of adverting to every circum|&s;tance which may po&s;itively or pre&s;umtively tend to &s;ub&s;tantiate the facts in the following narrative, makes it impo&s;&s;ible to avoid giving a brief hi&s;tory of the Circus and its origin. This, however, as it has long been a &s;ubject of public conver&s;ation, may not prove un|entertaining, no place having been more in|ternally convul&s;ed, or &s;truggled through more di&s;traction; nor is it wonderful. It was begot at Newmarket, born in St. George's Fields, and nur&s;ed in Bridewell, till falling into bad company at the Opera Hou&s;e, it de&s;pi&s;ed the advice of its tutor, aped all the fa&s;hionable ab&s;urdities, and at la&s;t eman|cipated from the puling childi&s;hne&s;s of rea|&s;on and plunged into the full maturity of folly at the Cockpit Royal.</P>
<P>In the month of February, 1782, having previou&s;ly imparted my intention to Mr. Hughes, I applied to Mr. Davis, of Bury-&s;treet, St. James's, to build a place which I intended to call the Royal Circus; offer|ing him a fourth of the profits which &s;hould accrue from the amu&s;ements there intended
<PB N="4" REF="22">
to be exhibited. He took but four and twenty hours to determine, for in that time he had communicated the bu&s;ine&s;s to Mr. James Grant, late of Coleman-&s;treet, Mr. George Grant, of America-&s;quare, and Mr. Harborne, then of Amen-corner, but &s;ince of John-&s;treet, Adelphi; who having the highe&s;t opinion of the plan I had given them, agreed, in conjunction with Mr. Davis, to &s;ub&s;cribe &s;ufficient money to erect the build|ing, and that I &s;hould be its &s;uperintendant and uncontroulable manager; that they would receive the fourth I had offered as a compen&s;ation for laying out their money; that Mr. Hughes &s;hould have one-third for his performance and breaking hor&s;es; and that I &s;hould have the remaining five-twelfths, the one-twelfth more than Mr. Hughes's proportion being adjudged me for my trouble as manager.</P>
<P>Mr. Hughes was to provide hor&s;es at his own expence, and I was to prepare the &s;cenes at mine; all other out-goings of every de|nomination the proprietors were to pay.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="23">The lea&s;es of the Magdalen Coffee-hou&s;e and the two hou&s;es adjoining were immediate|ly purcha&s;ed with a view to erect the build|ing in their &s;tead; but finding the place in|convenient, an application was made to Temple We&s;t, E&s;q. (&s;ince dead) of Charlotte-&s;treet, Rathbone-place, who owned the re|ver&s;ion of an oppo&s;ite piece of ground, and who, upon the condition of being received as a proprietor, con&s;ented to purcha&s;e the life right of the then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and let the ground to the four gentlemen above mentioned, him|&s;elf al&s;o being a party.</P>
<P>The dimen&s;ions of the building being de|termined on, and the heartie&s;t concurrence given to every mea&s;ure, I &s;ugge&s;ted all par|ties to &s;et earne&s;tly to work. Mr. Hughes &s;ought out for performers, I did the &s;ame. Upwards of twenty children were bound ap|prentices to Mr. Grimaldi, who I employed as ballet ma&s;ter, and who, by a memorandum of an agreement with me for the term of five years (in which we mutually covenanted to enter into a &s;pecial article) promi&s;ed that the apprentices, then about to be bound to him, &s;hould not be employed at any other place
<PB N="6" REF="24">
than the Royal Circus, and not there unle&s;s for my emolument, and by my order and direction.</P>
<P>In like manner I entered into an article under the penalty of &pound;.300 with the father of Ma&s;ter Ru&s;&s;ell, for three years, and two or three others at &s;horter periods.</P>
<P>It was now thought a proper time to finally arrange our own articles, for which purpo&s;e a meeting was had of the proprietors, Mr. Hughes and my&s;elf, where the &s;cheme being upon con&s;iderably a larger &s;cale than the original intention, and the expence in con&s;e|quence likely to be much higher, a fre&s;h agreement was propo&s;ed to be entered into, by virtue of which the proprietors were to re|ceive a third of the profit, Mr. Hughes the &s;ame, (&s;tanding all his own expences) and I the remaining third, and to be allowed an annuity of &pound;.150 for managing, and to &s;tand at no expence whatever.</P>
<P>An article was ordered to be drawn up by Mr. Harborne, in which the parties were to agree, over and above the afore-metioned
<PB N="7" REF="25">
covenants, that a committee, con&s;i&s;ting of Mr. Harman, &s;ecretary and trea&s;urer, on the part of the proprietors, Mr. Hughes and my&s;elf, &s;hould adju&s;t and decide upon the cur|rent bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. Harman having the ca&s;t|ing vote if any di&s;pute &s;hould ari&s;e between Mr. Hughes and me.</P>
<P>A licence, through the medium of Colonel We&s;t, was now applied for to the Duke of Manche&s;ter, which after an interval of &s;ome months was refu&s;ed, it appearing very doubt|ful whether a &s;ufficient power was ve&s;ted in the Lord Chamberlain to permit a public entertainment beyond the precincts of the court, and his grace being young in office, was very tenacious of treading upon unprece|dented ground.</P>
<P>It was now July, and no article drawn up, for which a variety of rea&s;ons were given. Mr. Harborne was repre&s;ented as a man of &s;uch exten&s;ive bu&s;ine&s;s, that a failure in point of time on his part, ought to be con|&s;idered as an admi&s;&s;ible excu&s;e; Mr. Davis repeatedly a&s;&s;ured me, that on this account he was obliged to put up with the neglect of
<PB N="8" REF="26">
private bu&s;ine&s;s of much greater magnitude; that nothing could exceed the fairne&s;s of their intentions, and I might be perfectly at ea&s;e. The&s;e very excu&s;es al&s;o were held out to Col. We&s;t, who&s;e lea&s;e and private agreement as proprietor were not executed. As I carried my good opinion of Mr. Davis to a pitch of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and for the &s;hort time I knew him, I had the highe&s;t &s;entiments of Col. We&s;t's honour and integrity, this &s;atisfied me. Indeed every lover of truth mu&s;t re|vere his memory; for if a man of &s;ound and uncorruptible principles ever exi&s;ted, that man was Colonel We&s;t. He was be&s;ides wonderfully calculated to take a part in a public concern; he had judgment to di&s;cover genius, and &s;pirit to encourage it; but it &s;eems as if a fatality marked the wayward &s;teps of this unfortunate place; and becau&s;e there happened to be one man belonging to it who had ta&s;te and liberality enough to re&s;cue it from the barbari&s;m of arithmetic, the craft of chicane, or the de&s;igning nicety of a gambling calculation, he mu&s;t be &s;natch|ed away, and the building be deprived of its &s;tronge&s;t prop and faire&s;t ornament.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="27">Mr. Hughes, however, was le&s;s at ea&s;e than me; he apprehended, and very &s;trongly, &s;ome improper de&s;ign on the part of the pro|prietors, nor did he &s;cruple to aver that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the lea&s;e was held out as a fal&s;e light to deceive us both; indeed, &s;o freely did he broach the&s;e &s;entiments, and in &s;uch invidious terms, that being of an opinion totally oppo&s;ite to his, I refu&s;ed to &s;peak to him, except about mere bu&s;ine&s;s, for &s;everal months.</P>
<P>The mode of making deci&s;ions in the com|mittee was now totally altered, Mr. Harman not having for &s;ome time had a voice, but &s;ome one or other of the proprietors in his &s;tead; for as the building advanced, it became a &s;ubject of amu&s;ement to them, and they were as proud of owning them&s;elves parties con|cerned, as they were before &s;hy of being known to have any thing to do with it; none of this I ever checked, but made it my &s;tudy to plea&s;e and &s;atisfy them, little thinking I was teaching them the art of governing only to dethrone me.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="28">In this, however, they have been a little premature; the theatical &s;cepter, like a witch's &s;pell, or a &s;orcerer's tali&s;man, contains many figurative charms, which, if ill pre&s;erved, or improperly u&s;ed, only brings down confu&s;ion on their heads, who have the temerity to tam|per with them.</P>
<P>A licence having been refu&s;ed by the Lord Chamberlain, the proprietors advi&s;ed with Mr. Mingay how they could be&s;t apply to the Magi&s;trates of the county for their permi&s;&s;ion. They were informed by that gentleman, that the only time at which the bench could grant leave, was at the Michaelmas &s;e&s;&s;ions; he fur|ther cautioned them not to open the Circus, till &s;uch con&s;ent was obtained. This advice, however, I ventured to oppo&s;e the moment I heard it. Mr. Mingay, as a coun&s;el, was right. To fly in the face of the law, did not certainly appear the likelie&s;t means of obtain|ing its protection; but if he had had any eventual judgment concerning the probable fate of a new public place, his &s;entiments mu&s;t have been the rever&s;e; &s;o much did I
<PB N="11" REF="29">
feel the force of this, that I made no &s;cruple to declare we ought immediately to open without a licence.</P>
<P>To &s;upport this opinion, I gave the fol|lowing rea&s;ons: the intere&s;t that had been exerted to procure the licence from the Lord Chamberlain, together with the many pre|parations going forward, had not only exited univer&s;al curio&s;ity, but rai&s;ed &s;ome envy; the &s;eeds of an oppo&s;ition to the application at michaelmas were already &s;own; the&s;e the world's ignorance of the &s;cheme would be &s;ure to nouri&s;h, till they got to &s;uch a head as to choke up all our hopes; proof of this came to us from &s;ome quarter or other every day; &s;ome reported that the place was built for tumbling and rope-dancing, and the intro|duction of drinking. Upon this ground I was &s;ure the magi&s;tracy would make a point of &s;etting their faces again&s;t it, le&s;t it &s;hould encourage idlene&s;s; others, who had heard Sir John Lade and Mr. Davis took a part in it, availed them&s;elves of the general opi|nion of tho&s;e gentlemen, by propagating that
<PB N="12" REF="30">
it was to be a receptacle for gambling.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this time a paragraph appeared in one of the papers, giving a &s;uppo&s;ed opinion of the entertain|ments, where Sir John Lade and Mr. Davis were reflected on, in the way I allude to above, in pretty &s;evere terms.</NOTE> The theatres naturally oppo&s;ed it, thinking a place prepared at &s;uch an expence might in the end rival them very formidably; all the&s;e difficulties I contended would be obviated by opening as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. I argued, that let whoever would e&s;pou&s;e our cau&s;e, the town was at la&s;t our be&s;t protection and firme&s;t dependance. There if we found friends, we might laugh at private malignity, nay, that the very reports which were &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread, would recoil upon tho&s;e who had the temerity to level them at us. What had we to do with fear? we were our&s;elves con&s;cious that nothing was intended but harmle&s;s amu&s;ements repre&s;ented by children, which could not encourage di&s;&s;ipation; and which, &s;o far from militating again&s;t the intere&s;t of the threatres, would be found to be a nur&s;ery for them, as the &s;chools of Oudinot and Ni|cholet are for tho&s;e in Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="31">I was an&s;wered, if we had &s;o many enemies, they would certainly take advantage of our opening without a licence, and inform again&s;t the place. I found no difficulty in pronoun|cing it would be the very be&s;t thing that could happen to us, we &s;hould then &s;ee our danger, and know how to guard again&s;t it. That hav|ing confirmed our&s;elves in the public good opinion, it would become a public cau&s;e. That the eligibility of the &s;cheme, and the re|gularity with which it was intended to be con|ducted, would confound the tongue of &s;can|dal. The con&s;ideration that &s;o many children and their families were maintained by it, and other favourable appearances, would &s;end the application to the &s;e&s;&s;ions upon &s;uch fair ground, as could not fail to in&s;ure it &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This advice operating contrary to my wi&s;hes, the work was &s;lackened, and the place ordered to be got ready for October, in&s;tead of the following month.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t time, I began to di&s;cover a &s;ort of po&s;itivene&s;s in mo&s;t of the proprietors, to which I had hitherto been unaccu&s;tomed. I did not like to thwart it, and yet I feared their per&s;i&s;ting in error would terminate
<PB N="14" REF="32">
in that very wilfulne&s;s which has been the de|&s;truction of almo&s;t every rea&s;onable mea&s;ure hitherto propo&s;ed. Contenting my&s;elf, how|ever, with repre&s;enting the folly of their &s;o &s;trenou&s;ly contending for a point, of which they had not experience enough to &s;ee the probable con&s;equences, and warning them that they would &s;ee my words verified, I gave up the matter, not without advi&s;ing them to neglect no opportunity of gathering the &s;en&s;e of the magi&s;trates, previous to the &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;tep they took towards this, was to give a public dinner, to which many of the gentlemen in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace were invited; none however attended; and this confirmed me &s;tronger than ever, that my apprehen&s;ions were but too well founded.</P>
<P>I now conceived it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that a memorial &s;hould be drawn up, and pre&s;ented to the magi&s;trates, by &s;ome one or other of the proprietors. The idea met their concurrence, and it was to be done immedi|ately; but Mr. Davis and Mr. Harborne being continually in the country, neither of the Mr. Grant's attended for a long while,
<PB N="15" REF="33">
and Col. We&s;t, mo&s;t unfortunately for the concern, being taken ill, this nece&s;&s;ary pre|liminary was neglected, and the licence when applied for lo&s;t by eighteen again&s;t fifteen affirmative voices, the greate&s;t part of which majority declared them&s;elves influenced again&s;t the application, by a letter which was read in court, written by order of the Secre|tary of State, to the Lord Lieutenant of the county of Surry, advi&s;ing the bench to licence no new places of public entertainment; and this letter was actually procured, by a repre|&s;entation that the Circus was intended for E O tables, and every &s;pecies of debauchery.</P>
<P>Thus, according to my prediction, the li|cence was lo&s;t by fal&s;e and &s;candalous reports again&s;t the place, and clearly &s;hews, corro|borated by what really happened when the Circus was actually opened without any per|mi&s;&s;ion whatever, that had my advice been taken, we mu&s;t have been &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Col. We&s;t continuing extreemly ill, the advantage of his advice was lo&s;t, and the other proprietors a good deal &s;oured by their di&s;appointment, were &s;ome time before they came to any re&s;olution; at length my origi|nal
<PB N="16" REF="34">
idea was adopted, and the place opened without a licence.</P>
<P>The world well recollects what encourage|ment the amu&s;ements received, &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in the kingdom re&s;orted to the Circus, and it was con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fa&s;hionable places about town. The continual cry of the proprietors was, that I had done wonders, and that let what would be the fate of the concern, there was no degree of liberality that &s;hould not be &s;hewn me for &s;uch uncommon and &s;ucce&s;sful exertions.</P>
<P>In all this time no article was prepared; and though I was uncea&s;ingly teazed by Mr. Hughes, who went very great lengths indeed, and took mo&s;t unwarrantable liberties with the proprietors names, to &s;upport his a&s;&s;er|tions, though he even a&s;&s;ured me, that they had con&s;ulted together to di&s;mi&s;s me, though he called in Mr. Grimaldi to witne&s;s it, who declared, he had heard the proprietors &s;ay, they would never &s;ign an agreement with either me, or Mr. Hughes; this, and ten times more had not power to &s;hake my opi|nion. I certainly was anxious that the matter
<PB N="17" REF="35">
&s;hould be fini&s;hed. I expo&s;tulated with Mr. Davis, and with Col. We&s;t, on the &s;ubject; the fir&s;t of whom <HI>&s;eemed,</HI> and the other <HI>was</HI> as unea&s;y as my&s;elf. Mr. Davis declared, that were the intentions of the other proprie|tors &s;uch as Mr. Hughes and Mr. Grimaldi repre&s;ented, yet his connections with them were of &s;uch a kind, and his power over them &s;o great, that he <Q REND="inline">"could and would," (the&s;e were his words,) "command for me their majority upon all occa&s;ions; but the fact was the very rever&s;e, the pro|prietors having the be&s;t intentions towards me."</Q> That the preparation of the article was only delayed by the negligence of Mr. Har|borne, he laughed at my fears, and won|dered how I could entertain them: mu&s;t not he be void of honour, and merit the reproach of every hone&s;t man, if he could be capable of deluding me upon a &s;ubject &s;o &s;erious, &s;o material to me?</P>
<P>I could not bear &s;o many appeals to my feelings. I blu&s;hed that I had for a moment entertained an ill opinion of a man, than whom Lucifer or Iago would not have bet|ter acted the part of a friend. I con&s;ider|ed Mr. Hughes and Mr. Grimaldi as
<PB N="18" REF="36">
two incendiaries, who, for &s;elfi&s;h ends, were endeavouring to &s;et me at variance with the proprietors, and I became more carele&s;s about the article than ever.</P>
<P>An information was laid again&s;t the Circus, and we were open only nine nights. My prophecy began now to be verified; all who had been our enemies became our warme&s;t advocates; very di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;ons con|&s;ulted with us about opening again, and in|telligence was given us from very powerful authority, that another application to the Lord Chamberlain would be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The general expences, however, being all incurred, and the performers engaged, we thought it advi&s;eable to open, if po&s;&s;ible, upon &s;ome plan within the law, which we could extend, if we had the good fortune to &s;ucceed with the Lord Chamberlain, or con|tinue (if the application failed) till the follow|ing October.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, I devi&s;ed a mode of amu&s;ement unlike any thing we had done be|fore; which, &s;anctioned by coun&s;els opinion, was brought out with &s;ucce&s;s; but at the end
<PB N="19" REF="37">
of the fifth night, a new information being laid, Mr. Hughes was taken up and &s;ent to Bridewell.</P>
<P>In proportion as we were per&s;ecuted, &s;o we gained friends. At the &s;e&s;&s;ions, Mr. Hughes was honourably relea&s;ed, and the entertain|ment pronounced not to have been illegal. The application to the Lord Chamberlain went on rapidly, who being &s;olicited in a very powerful manner, declared he would give a licence, if the Attorney-General would pro|nounce him competent to do it.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s kept us on in anxious expec|tation till the latter end of February, when Mr. Hughes ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted on an article, without which, he declared, he would with|draw him&s;elf from the &s;cheme.</P>
<P>I now began to find that this matter has been procra&s;tinated only to beat us down in point of terms; for upon requiring &s;o &s;erious an explanation, it aukwardly came out that they had a good deal con&s;idered of it, and that in a different way than formerly. They now began to talk of the va&s;t &s;ums of money that had been laid out, of the lo&s;s the
<PB N="20" REF="38">
place had &s;u&s;tained in throwing away &s;o much time, that if no licence &s;hould be obtained, or the concern involved in any future embar|ra&s;&s;ment, they mu&s;t bear all the burden. In &s;hort, the new propo&s;al was, that Mr. Hughes and I &s;hould receive each a fourth of the pro|fits, after paying all common expences, allow|ing them intere&s;t for their money, and a hun|dred a year ground-rent.</P>
<P>How did Mr. Davis come off here? I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay with flying colours. He made it appear as plain to me, that I &s;hould clear two thou&s;and a year for my life, as ever Bre&s;|law did one of his auditors, that he had con|jured a &s;hilling into his pocket, when the fact was, he had picked it of two, which were paid coming in at the door.</P>
<P>I did, however, mu&s;ter up &s;o much clear-&s;ightedne&s;s, as to be a little unea&s;y, not for fear the article &s;hould not be &s;igned, but le&s;t they &s;hould pare away its value till it was not worth &s;igning; and joining i&s;&s;ue with Mr. Hughes, never cea&s;ed importuning Mr. Davis, till, with the approbation of the proprietors, he &s;igned a memorandum of an agreement,
<PB N="21" REF="39">
in behalf of him&s;elf and the re&s;t, in the terms before mentioned, with the addition of tying up Mr. Hughes and my&s;elf from engaging at any other place of amu&s;ement, and a promi&s;e of entering into a &s;pecial agreement, as &s;oon as it &s;hould be found convenient to lay a pro|per deed before coun&s;el. This memorandum was al&s;o &s;igned by Mr. Hughes and my&s;elf, and witne&s;&s;ed by Mr. Harman.</P>
<P>Whether the Attorney-General's opinion was never obtained, whether he was prevented from giving it, whether the intere&s;t u&s;ed to get at the Lord Chamberlain was overturned by oppo&s;ite influence, or whatever was the cau&s;e, I will not venture to pronounce my opinion; certain it is, we got no licence. The matter has been &s;o variou&s;ly repre&s;ented to me, that in relating what I have been told, I might very likely take a liberty with high and di&s;tingui&s;hed characters, who, for ought I can with certain|ty advance, never heard of the Royal Circus but in common with the re&s;t of the world. Great names are very often u&s;ed to &s;erve little purpo&s;es; here they were u&s;ed to no purpo&s;e at all.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="40">This refu&s;al determined us once more to open the Circus, merely to feel the pul&s;e of the town, and to try whether all the pompous reports of our &s;ucce&s;s among the great would not &s;o far awe our enemies as to make them de&s;i&s;t from any further per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>We did &s;o, and it an&s;wered our end beyond expectation. The Circus was opened on the 15th of March, and it continued &s;o without interruption till the middle of the following September; during all which time the &s;en&s;e of the memorandum was literally conformed to by the payment of a fourth of the profits to Mr. Hughes and my&s;elf every Saturday.</P>
<P>Soon after the Circus opened, Mr. Sewell, my Attorney and Solicitor, drew up a &s;pecial deed, which was read by the proprietors, and (except the preamble and the mode of tying me to the Circus) approved of.</P>
<P>In Mr. Sewell's article, conformable to the memorandum, I was the acknowledged ma|nager of the &s;tage department for my life; my current conduct was to be decided upon by a
<PB N="23" REF="41">
weekly committee, which, &s;o far from having a power to di&s;mi&s;s me from the Circus, was obliged to &s;upport and uphold me in it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould here mention, that ju&s;t before this period, Mr. James Grant had &s;old his &s;hare to Sir John Lade, and Mr. Harborne had erect|ed him&s;elf into the joint characters of trea|&s;urer, &s;olicitor, and proprietor.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance did not create a little jealou&s;y among the other proprietors, nor was it by any means a plea&s;ant thing to either Mr. Hughes or my&s;elf, a proprietor being a very improper trea&s;urer to a concern. This was re|pre&s;ented at Sir John Lade's hou&s;e, the Sun|day before the place opened; Mr. Davis, Sir John Lade, Mr. Grant, Mr. Hughes, and my&s;elf pre&s;ent; and Mr Davis taking up the matter extremely warm, propo&s;ed the place for Mr. Savage, a gentleman we all knew, and of who&s;e integrity we had the highe&s;t opinion. This met the wi&s;hes of every one pre&s;ent, and I expected to &s;ee him in his of|fice the following Saturday; in&s;tead of whom, however, Mr. Harborne &s;ingly nomi|nated
<PB N="24" REF="42">
Mr. Gro&s;mith, his brother-in-law; who has ever &s;ince acted as a trea&s;urer for him, and lately with the additional title of Secre|tary.</P>
<P>I only mention this circum&s;tance, to &s;hew how completely the proprietors were ruled by the brilliant Mr. Harborne; nor can it be wondered at. I have already in&s;tanced his <HI>alacrity</HI> in the di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, and when I come, in its place, to give a &s;pecimen of the elegance of his ta&s;te, the winning &s;prightline&s;s of his manner, and the captivating charms of his oratorical eloquence, the mo&s;t lively hopes may be entertained, that before the Circus &s;hall fini&s;h its career, the world will &s;ee him making out latitats upon three hor&s;es, taking in&s;tructions for a brief in a pantomime, or imitating the &s;erjeants when they make their bows at We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall in a <HI>Minuet de la Cour.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;ame Mr. Harborne, with infinite la|bour and pains (I think I &s;ee him wiping his forehead) from the draft made out by Mr. Sewell, formed another, in which were intro|duced
<PB N="25" REF="43">
many particulars totally foreign to the original intention. Neither Mr. Hughes nor my&s;elf was to have the liberty, without the con&s;ent of a committee, to publi&s;h any book; that &s;ixty pounds a week were to be depo&s;ited in his hands as a fund to pay all contingent expences. He nominated him&s;elf al&s;o perpe|tual trea&s;urer. The Committee was to have &s;uch an ab&s;olute power, that were they in|clined to make vexatious and frivolous re&s;o|utions, the concern mu&s;t have been &s;o har|ra&s;&s;ed and perplexed, that no bu&s;ine&s;s of either Mr. Hughes's deparment or mine could po&s;&s;ibly have gone on.</P>
<P>I not only &s;aw all this, but that the prohi|bition of publications &s;truck particularly hard at me. It was repre&s;ented to me, however, that no advantage &s;hould be taken of me; that the article was &s;o worded, le&s;t any non|&s;en&s;e of Mr. Hughes (I u&s;e the words of Mr. Davis and Mr. Harborne) &s;hould be publi&s;h|ed to the di&s;grace of the concern; that he was a man &s;o trouble&s;ome and unprincipled, and his conduct had been &s;o reprehen&s;ible, they were determined to have every po&s;&s;ible curb on him, and particularly that the words and
<PB N="26" REF="44">
 mu&s;ic of all my pieces were not implied in the clau&s;e.</P>
<P>At this time another agreement was entered into by the Proprietors them&s;elves, to enforce the ob&s;ervance of their own private engage|ments. This deed is very material to my claim. It was executed by Colonel We&s;t, Mr. Davis, Mr. Harborne, Mr. George Grant, and Sir John Lade, and provided, among many other things, for the &s;ecurity of the proceedings of a committee, by a clau&s;e to the following effect: That &s;hould any of the Proprietors be inclined to &s;ell a &s;hare, it &s;hould be offered at a &s;tipulated price to the re&s;t, and that upon their refu&s;al of the bar|gain, the buyer &s;hould be obliged to pur|cha&s;e, &s;ubject to all covenants and agreement what&s;oever; and particularly that the pre&s;ent, as well as all future Proprietors, &s;hould be bound to keep, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, all en|gagements entered into with Mr. Hughes and my&s;elf. The memorandum recited above, which Mr. Davis entered into with the con|currence of the re&s;t of the Proprietors, was &s;igned previous to the execution of the agree|ment &s;ome months. Will the &s;agacious Mr.
<PB N="27" REF="45">
Harborne after this &s;ay he knew any thing of law when he &s;igned my di&s;charge from the Circus?</P>
<P>From the month of October, 1781, to this hour, (for it &s;hould be under&s;tood that I had long &s;uch a &s;cheme in idea, though till Fe|bruary I could not find a per&s;on to take it in hand in any eligible way) I have received no emolument from any other place than the Circus. It will not therefore appear a&s;toni&s;h|ing, that in &s;uch a length of time I &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary, for my private purpo&s;es, to re|ceive money on account from the Proprietors. I did &s;o, previous to the 15th of March, to the amount of 261l. which &s;um, together with every other expended or advanced for any purpo&s;e whatever, was agreed in the draft of the &s;pecial article to go into a ma&s;s, e&s;timated at 12,000l. for which the concern was to pay ten per cent. intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I was in debt about 600l. at the commence|ment of the &s;cheme, &s;ome of which demands it would be very tedious and unplea&s;ant to explain; they were the dregs of former law|&s;uits, penalties of engagements for a valuable and unfortunate relation, and &s;ome the con|&s;equences
<PB N="28" REF="46">
of follies committed twenty years ago; the&s;e debts, by the 15th of March, grew to 800l. &s;imply by the addition of law expences. The Circus now began to yield me very hand&s;omely, and I had paid, by the month of July, near 400l.</P>
<P>About this time the remainder of my cre|ditors began to per&s;ecute me in a mo&s;t rigor|ous and extraordinary manner; this appeared very &s;ingular, as they had received from me &s;o much money, and more e&s;pecially as the loading me with law expences would only dimini&s;h my ability to &s;atisfy them.</P>
<P>Upon &s;earching into this bu&s;ine&s;s, I ea&s;ily found they were &s;et on; the Proprietors were of the &s;ame opinion, and made no &s;cruple to pronounce Mr. Hughes the incendiary in&s;tru|ment; &s;o much did Mr. Davis appear irritated at it, that he gave a promi&s;e to the officer, who was always upon the&s;e occa&s;ions employ|ed to arre&s;t me, that he would an&s;wer for every thing in future again&s;t me, that my per&s;on might be &s;afe, and I might pur&s;ue my bu&s;ine&s;s in tranquility.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="47">Why Mr. Davis refu&s;ed to keep his word, the very next time I was arre&s;ted, he be&s;t knows.</P>
<P>The Circus about this time began to be one of the compleate&s;t &s;cenes of confu&s;ion that folly, ignorance, and intere&s;ted art could plunge it into. The parents of the appren|tices were eternally pre&s;enting me with peti|tions again&s;t Mr. Grimaldi; criminal accu&s;a|tions were preferred, addre&s;&s;ed to religious lords; the magi&s;trates interfered, and a com|pleat inve&s;tigation into the morals and con|duct of the place was ordered; &s;ome con&s;ci|entious gentlemen in the commi&s;&s;ion, who had re&s;olved right or wrong to vote again&s;t it the following October, were for its annihilation; and one in particular declared, he was &s;o &s;hocked at the idea of bringing up a number of children to the &s;tage, that he &s;hould be afraid to meet them in the other world le&s;t they &s;hould reproach him. The gentleman, I believe, did not con&s;ider that there would be no &s;uch danger, if that meeting happened to be in Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="48">Three very re&s;pectable gentlemen were ap|pointed inqui&s;itors upon this occa&s;ion, who&s;e great humanity, high honour, and unim|peachable integrity, are univer&s;ally acknow|ledged. They found nothing that could in|duce them to take part again&s;t the place, and not only the accu&s;ation fell to the ground, but the attempt to injure the &s;cheme turned out materially to its advantage.</P>
<P>We were however the be&s;t judges of our internal commotions. Mr. Grimaldi's know|ledge of the foibles of the Proprietors, his accommodating temper, and above all the &s;ecret manner in which he wormed him&s;elf into their favour to my prejudice, glo&s;&s;ed over with them a number of mo&s;t unpardon|able faults; and it was in vain for me to order him upon any duty, when by a tale told to Mr. Harborne he could get him&s;elf excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>As to the re&s;t, Mr. Hughes was evidently trying to get the place into his own hands, by harra&s;&s;ing the Proprietors with accounts, in which they made no &s;cruple to &s;ay they
<PB N="31" REF="49">
were impo&s;ed on, ordering dre&s;&s;es they di&s;ap|proved of, and u&s;ing their names with mo&s;t licentious and unwarrantable freedom. All this, together with his canva&s;&s;ing the county in his name for the licence, and much other indirect conduct, &s;o alarmed the Proprietors, that they were now the mo&s;t anxious for the articles; &s;everal meetings were had on it, and at la&s;t Mr. Hughes, upon being paid all his demands, agreed that the licence &s;hould be made out in his name and mine; and that proper alterations being made in the mode and manner of the article by Mr. Davis and Mr. Pardon, the &s;pirit of it, which had al|ways been complied with, &s;hould remain, and then it &s;hould be executed.</P>
<P>Thus matters continued in tolerable tran|quility (except, as u&s;ual, fre&s;h law-&s;uits being conjured up again&s;t me; &s;ome legal, others not &s;o) till October.</P>
<P>The day came when we mu&s;t apply for the licence; and Mr. Hughes, after all that had pa&s;&s;ed, in&s;i&s;ted upon having it made out in his name, or not at all. Nothing could
<PB N="32" REF="50">
equal the a&s;toni&s;hment of the Proprietors at this demand; they fairly declared it &s;hould have my name to it, as a check upon Mr. Hughes, or they would give up every concern with the place; that they had the highe&s;t opinion of my abilities; that my conduct had been fair, hone&s;t, and in every re&s;pect unex|ceptionable; whereas they believed Mr. Hughes to be guilty, in many in&s;tances, of proceedings directly the rever&s;e.</P>
<P>For my own part, I &s;aw very plainly that the lea&s;t appearance of di&s;pute among&s;t our|&s;elves would infallibly overturn our whole &s;cheme; be&s;ides, it was the cleare&s;t thing in the world that Mr. Hughes wrangled for no more than an additional feather to his eque&s;|trian helmet, which I was very well con|tented he &s;hould wear. I argued, that while they were in contention for a mere name, the &s;hadow of the bu&s;ine&s;s, they would lo&s;e the licence, which was the &s;ub&s;tance; and that the place, and not the per&s;on, was the object of permi&s;&s;ion. In this opinion Mr. Mingay joined me; the licence was a&s;ked for in the name of Mr. Hughes, and granted.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="51">During the meeting at King&s;ton, our fu|ture operations were a &s;ubject of con&s;ultation. As the place could now open by authority, as the entertainments would be entirely changed, by the introduction of burlettas and pantomimes, the orche&s;tra thrown open, to|gether with &s;everal other de&s;irable advan|tages, of which we might now avail our&s;elves, I advi&s;ed a recommencement of the amu&s;e|ments. I neverthele&s;s warned them how impo&s;&s;ible it would be to keep open the whole winter; but in order to make it up to the performers, to take expence off the &s;houlders of the concern, and to provide novelty for the en&s;uing &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, I fur|ther advi&s;ed an excur&s;ion to Liverpool, Nor|wich, or &s;ome other capital place; there to wear out the old pieces, to be in the conti|nual practice of new ones, and &s;o come back at Ea&s;ter with a fund of fre&s;h dramatic mate|rials, which would be &s;o much variety ready prepared with little trouble, and no ex|pence.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more eagerly catched at than this advice; it was &s;o fea&s;ible; &s;uch a &s;elf-evident advantage; &s;o like general&s;hip:
<PB N="34" REF="52">
Why, then, was not it adopted? The Pro|prietors of the Circus would not be con&s;i&s;tent, if they were once in the right. They have a mo&s;t tender affection for their own opinion; and as to ob&s;tinacy, no drove of pigs, in their journey from Berk&s;hire to Smithfield, ever had &s;uch an aver&s;ion to a direct road.</P>
<P>Had my advice been taken, the Public would not now be nau&s;eated at the Royal Circus (that place which once vied with the Opera-hou&s;e; which, under the title of the Fairy World, enchanted its audience with all the magic of its name;) with the leavings of a barrel organ, the dregs of a porter club, or the refu&s;e of Sadler's Wells.</P>
<P>Three or four days before we applied for the licence, the Circus and the world had the misfortune to lo&s;e Col. We&s;t, after having endured for near a twelvemonth all the tor|ture and languor of a &s;low con&s;uming wound, with a re&s;ignation and fortitude which, like all other of his actions, evinced his great mind. He dying, bequeathed wretchedne&s;s to his family, &s;orrow to all his connections, and regret to the memory of every man who
<PB N="35" REF="53">
who had the happine&s;s and advantage of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>The Circus opened, and con&s;idering the expences of the rece&s;s, the &s;tock required to bring out the new things, and other incidental and unavoidable out-goings, did tolerably well. After a few weeks, however, it was decidedly clear that it would not do in the winter; this induced me to think in earne&s;t of the country &s;cheme. I pre&s;&s;ed Mr. Hughes about it, who promi&s;ed to write to Norwich, and propo&s;ed it afre&s;h to the Pro|prietors, from whom I was a&s;toni&s;hed to re|ceive a cool an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I had now paid near 600l. to my creditors; and yet, &s;o great a part of this &s;um was for law expences, that I was &s;till in debt 450l. It is incredible, upon the failure of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the Circus, how I was per&s;ecuted, and all for trifles; which, by the management of bailiffs, evidently at the in&s;tance of Mr. Hughes, were magnified into things of con&s;e|quence. If I was to &s;ign a warrant of attor|ney, it was in his hou&s;e; if I was arre&s;ted, it was in his hou&s;e. In &s;hort, the mo&s;t &s;can|dalous
<PB N="36" REF="54">
and illegal mea&s;ures were taken pur|po&s;ely to expo&s;e me; and every illicit and vul|gar manoeuvre put in practice to injure my peace of mind, and render me incapable of doing my bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>So much did this appear the opinion of the Proprietors, that, to relieve my inconveniences at that time, they depo&s;ited their draft of a hundred pounds in the hands of Mr. Sewell, and impowered him to inform my creditors, that they would be an&s;werable for the pay|ment of the re&s;t of my debts in a twelve-month.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis promi&s;ed to be pre&s;ent at the meeting of my creditors, in&s;tead of which, however, he wrote the following letter:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter being read, and Mr. Sewell ex|plaining the &s;entiments of Mr. Davis to be a determination to enter into the above agree|ment, the creditors were very well &s;atisfied, and another meeting was propo&s;ed, when Mr. Davis was to be pre&s;ent, and fini&s;h the bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>On the day of this meeting, however, Mr. Sewell received the following letter:</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM &s;orry to acquaint you, that Mr. We&s;t, Mr. Grant, and Mr. Harborne, ab&s;o|lutely

decline to undertake to &s;ettle Mr. Dib|din's affairs, or to engage for the payment of any part of his debts. I am therefore, to my great mortification, in a minority of the Pro|prietors of the Circus, and have not the power of &s;hewing my regard to Mr. Dibdin, by getting his bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ettled. I &s;hall be glad of &s;eeing you; and am your humble &s;ervant,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>WM. DAVIS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
<CLOSER>Stephen John Sewell, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this &s;huffling, another gentleman of the law, as well as Mr. Sewell, advi&s;ed the creditors to re&s;t contented, a&s;&s;uring them that the promi&s;e made by the Proprie|tors was binding in the &s;tricte&s;t manner, even though not formally entered into, they having empowered Mr. Sewell to make it in their name. The creditors were &s;atisfied with this, and went away, after being witne&s;s for one another that they would think no more of me, but &s;eek their remedy again&s;t the Pro|prietors, at the end of the twelvemonth.</P>
<P>Mr. Davis has lately had the kindne&s;s to &s;ay, that as &s;oon as Mr. Sewell, (who is con|tending for my right) &s;hall have <HI>done me a &s;er|vice,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="57">
I &s;hall write a pamphlet again&s;t him by way of thanks. I would a&s;k Mr. Davis, if he him&s;elf ever did me a &s;ervice, how comes it I am now in the King's Bench? and if Mr. Sewell is &s;erving me, does not Mr. Davis con|fe&s;s his own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment? The malignity of this caution to Mr. Sewell is too apparent. Mr. Davis knows how much it is his intere&s;t to preju|dice my &s;olicitor again&s;t me; fortunately, however, Mr. Sewell has too good an opini|on of me to be wrought on by any &s;uch in&s;i|nuations; and if he had not, his inveterate in|tegrity in the di&s;charge of his conduct to his clients, will ever induce him to take care of his honour and his character, than to &s;uffer any craft or cunning to turn him a&s;ide from an hone&s;t di&s;charge of his duty.</P>
<P>Mr. Sewell has &s;uffered from Mr. Hughes almo&s;t as many indignities as I have, and wholly on my account. 'Tis a &s;hame that Mr. Davis is not content with his treatment of me, without conniving at any dirty work of a man, who&s;e name he has, in my hearing, a hundred times execrated.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="58">Three of the&s;e creditors had actions again&s;t me, upon which I had been a long time held to bail; one of whom dropped all proceed|ings, but the other two went on at the com|mencement of the Term; being therefore in|capable of paying the money: on the 21&s;t of January, I was obliged to &s;urrender my&s;elf to pri&s;on, to exonerate my bail.</P>
<P>It will appear very curious in this place, that when the Proprietors refu&s;ed to fulfil their promi&s;e of paying my debts, they ad|vi&s;ed me to throw my&s;elf into the King's-Bench, offering to be &s;ecurity for the rules, and to give me apartments in the Circus; will it be credited then, after I had &s;urren|dered my&s;elf, they not only refu&s;ed to be my &s;ecurity, but fir&s;t voted me out of the Circus, and then u&s;ed a &s;ecret influence to prevent my getting the rules at all. It is however very true; and though I hug my&s;elf at the good con&s;equences that mu&s;t re&s;ult to me from their &s;hallow, mi&s;erable policy, I can|not help feeling the malice and rancour of &s;uch a &s;candalous bu&s;ine&s;s, with that indigna|tion in which I am &s;ure every hone&s;t man mu&s;t join me.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="59">But, as Macheath &s;ays, <Q REND="inline">"It is a plain proof the world's all alike, and that even our gang can no more tru&s;t one another, than other people."</Q> Sorry I am that I have to re|proach my&s;elf with belonging to that gang.</P>
<P>To clear my ground I mu&s;t go back to about &s;ix weeks after the Circus opened, at which time a re&s;olution was formed to &s;hut it up, to open at Chri&s;tmas, and then continue the entertainments if they &s;hould &s;ucceed. This I &s;trongly oppo&s;ed, recommending the country &s;cheme; the Proprietors, however, confident of &s;ucce&s;s, over-ruled me.</P>
<P>When the place came to be opened, mat|ters turned out as I had repre&s;ented them, even the fir&s;t week did not bring its ex|pences.</P>
<P>This cau&s;ed &s;uch univer&s;al di&s;&s;atisfaction, that every Saturday was expected to be the la&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on. Sir John Lade came to the Committee-room, and con&s;tantly blamed me for &s;uffering the mu&s;ic to go ill, exhibiting &s;uch a curious and &s;cientific &s;y&s;tem of criti|ci&s;m,
<PB N="42" REF="60">
as I &s;incerely believe, were it reduced to rule, would procure a &s;weep&s;takes to be run for in all the regularity of a <HI>pas de quatre</HI>&mdash;As well as edified by it, I &s;hould have been ex|tremely amu&s;ed, if it had not been embelli&s;hed with &s;ome hints of properer managers, and the names of Grimaldi, Sling&s;by, Novo&s;ciel&s;ki, and others, occa&s;ionally dropped, <Q REND="inline">"who were capable of bringing the whole world to the Circus."</Q></P>
<P>Since however the place was &s;o indiffer|ently conducted, either it &s;hould not continue open, or the expences &s;hould be con&s;iderably lowered; he a&s;ked me fir&s;t of all what part of the band I could &s;pare? I &s;aid I could very ill &s;pare any, but if it mu&s;t be curtailed, I &s;hould begin with the trumpets. No, with a look of mo&s;t ineffable contempt at my ig|norance, he in&s;i&s;ted on the trumpets being kept, even though <HI>they &s;hould play by them|&s;elves,</HI> for that they had a mon&s;trous effect in recitative. As I knew I might as well have explained my&s;elf to one of his grey hor&s;es, and as I had more whims than his to plea&s;e, I contented my&s;elf with tacitly &s;trik|ing
<PB N="43" REF="61">
out the trumpets, and the names of a few u&s;ele&s;s performers, who had been only en|gaged in compliment to Mr. Hughes. Eve|ry preparation for novelty which happened to be in hand was next ordered to be &s;topped; painters, carpenters, and others, were to be di&s;charged by whole&s;ale; and as we had low receipts, &s;o we were to have low expences. It was in vain to repre&s;ent that I could not produce new things without materials; I might u&s;e the old ones; that is to &s;ay, Tom Thumb might appear as an Alderman, Dolla-lolla as a witch, and the queen of the giants &s;queeze her&s;elf into the fly-jacket of a fairy. They however, at this moment, have recour&s;e to more mi&s;erable expedients; for in&s;tead of tho&s;e dre&s;&s;es which induced the world to call the Circus the temple of ta&s;te, the performers are &s;tuck out in all the draggle-tail finery of a ma&s;querade at St. Giles's. Perhaps the Cyprian queen of that eque&s;trian Adonis, Sir John, conde&s;cends to in&s;pire the wardrobe-keeper with the &s;ublimity of her ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Nay, more impo&s;&s;ibilities than the&s;e were exacted from me; I was to di&s;charge the per|formers
<PB N="44" REF="62">
(purpo&s;ely engaged for the new pieces) and then bring out the new pieces without them.</P>
<P>Expo&s;tulating with Mr. Davis upon the ab|&s;urdity of all this, he told me not to regard any thing Sir John Lade &s;aid, for that he was a man who would &s;et every body of people together by the ears he had any thing to do with.</P>
<P>On the other hand, my good ally, Mr. Hughes, was continually in con&s;ultation with his bo&s;om friend and &s;ecretary, Mr. Stratford, (the bailiff who always arre&s;ted me) how to make a fini&s;h at once of me and my affairs: He made a violent entry into my hou&s;e, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf forcibly in his rage, not only of all my property, but of the landlord's, with|out authority of any kind whatever, unle&s;s his having, again&s;t my con&s;ent, undertook to pay money for me (evidently with a view of get|ting me into his power) can be &s;o called.</P>
<P>The Circus was now in a &s;tate of the mo&s;t complete di&s;traction; the very &s;ervants &s;aw I was not properly &s;upported by the proprietors,
<PB N="45" REF="63">
and therefore lo&s;t all re&s;pect for me. In &s;hort, all &s;ubordination was at an end; nor could the eloquence of the accompli&s;hed Mr. Har|borne re&s;tore it, as will appear by the recep|tion of the following oration, which well de|&s;erves a title by it&s;elf.</P>

<P>A univer&s;al tittering immediately prevail|ed; the confu&s;ion recommenced, and in five minutes the great Mr. Harborne was heard la|menting that his authority had not been able to awe one of the rebels, whom he detected, like Guy Faux, bearing a light to &s;et off the fire-works before their time.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="64">Within a day or two of this memorable event, I came to the King's Bench; Mr. Davis gave his name as one of my &s;ecurities for the rules, and &s;uffered Mr. Sewell to make the u&s;ual enquiries; but being a&s;ked when he would &s;ign the bond, an&s;wered not at all, be|cau&s;e the re&s;t of the proprietors had refu&s;ed to join him.</P>
<P>I began to &s;ee the world now in a new light. I feared what Mr. Hughes and many others had told me of Mr. Davis (that he had not really been my friend, but appeared &s;o by the con&s;ent of the other proprietors, the bet|ter to carry their mea&s;ures) was but too true, the more e&s;pecially as he had recently &s;old half his &s;hare to Mr. Grimaldi. To inve&s;ti|gate this at once, I &s;ent him the following letter and re&s;olutions:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MATTERS re&s;pecting the Circus having gone to a very alarming length, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould reque&s;t the literal per|formance of tho&s;e promi&s;es you have &s;o often
<PB N="47" REF="65">
made me, and which as a friend, a man, and a gentleman, you are bound to abide by.</P>
<P>Through the whole progre&s;s of this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, it has been your uniform declaration to me, that I had a right to the fourth of the pro|fits, and to con&s;ider my&s;elf as the manager of the &s;tage department at the Circus, fully and entirely &s;ubject only to the controul of a com|mittee; and whenever I have expre&s;&s;ed my fears of any unwillingne&s;s on the part of the proprietors to fulfil this agreement, you have di&s;&s;ipated them by a&s;&s;uring me, that you could and would command a majority in my fa|vour.</P>
<P>You have (empowered by a committee) &s;igned a paper to the above effect; and, from the &s;pirit of that paper, an article has been actually drawn, but not executed; and tho' I know, from the be&s;t authorities, that it is &s;trongly binding on the parties, yet from a natural wi&s;h to prevent litigation, I have fre|quently urged a formal perfecting of the ne|ce&s;&s;ary writings. Whenever I have done &s;o,
<PB N="48" REF="66">
you have con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ured me you would never fell your &s;hare, or any part of it, till you had &s;een every thing &s;ettled to my entire &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>You have very often, not only profe&s;&s;ed your&s;elf perfectly &s;atisfied with my attention to the Circus, but have ever expre&s;&s;ed an a&s;toni&s;hment at my being able to furni&s;h it with &s;o much variety; and when I was un|ju&s;tly and cruelly harra&s;&s;ed by my creditors, evidently through collateral and incendiary means, you gave it as your opinion, that no man was ever with &s;o little rea&s;on &s;o inhu|manly per&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>When we went to King&s;ton, you had the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e, according to your own declara|ation, of my talents and integrity; &s;o much &s;o, indeed, that you a&s;&s;ured me you would rather lo&s;e the licence than not have my name to it.</P>
<P>The world tells me, at this moment, that you are changed; that you look lightly up|on all the promi&s;es you have formerly made,
<PB N="49" REF="67">
and hold up your having parted with half your &s;hare as a proof of it. My an&s;wer is, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible. That a breach of &s;uch en|gagements would &s;peak you void of that ho|nour on which I have &s;o long relied, and which I give you an opportunity of vindicat|ing, by entreating you to move the two re&s;o|lutions in the committee, which my brother (to whom I have given a power of attorney) will have the plea&s;ure of delivering to you.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I never heard that Mr. Wilde had called at my hou&s;e &s;ince he did me the favour to deli|ver your me&s;&s;age. I &s;hould not have delayed for a moment the &s;ending an an&s;wer, if I could have written with a probability of mitigating in any degree the mortifications which you mu&s;t receive in your di&s;agreeable &s;ituation, which I am truly &s;orry for, but have not the power to redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of the Circus has been attend|ed with a &s;eries of perplexing &s;ituations pre|vious to the laying the foundation of the building to this hour; hardly a week has pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome new mi&s;chief ari&s;ing to perplex and involve the parties concerned in that unfortunate undertaking. At this time I find my&s;elf con&s;iderably above two thou|&s;and pounds out of pocket, with a very poor pro&s;pect of recovering any part of it. The other proprietors are in the &s;ame &s;tate. The
<PB N="61" REF="79">
&s;um of money expended is a matter of &s;erious con&s;ideration; and to have continued the undertaking a year or two longer in the loo&s;e and extravagant manner in which it has hi|therto been conducted, would have accumu|lated a debt that mu&s;t have overwhelmed and brought &s;ome of the parties concerned to a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>If I was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ink every guinea I have in the Circus, it is not within my power to oblige the other proprietors to go the &s;ame length with me. Your conduct as manager of the undertaking was pronounced the cau&s;e of the failure of the Circus; and being &s;cru|tinized by four out of five of the proprietors, has been thought &s;ufficiently reprehen&s;ible for them to vote your expul&s;ion. You know that a majority determines all matters of bu|&s;ine&s;s relative to the Circus; therefore my &s;ingle vote, had I given it, would have an|&s;wered no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I need not &s;ay that I entertain the highe&s;t opinion of your abilities; the alacrity I have &s;hewn in advancing my money to carry on the &s;cheme in St. George's Fields, and the trou|ble
<PB N="62" REF="80">
I have taken to forward the bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;peak fully to that point. As a friend, and a very old acquaintance, I &s;hould have had infinite &s;atisfaction if the project had an&s;wered your expectation; and I am very &s;orry that your conduct has lo&s;t you the confidence of the proprietors, who, you mu&s;t confe&s;s, readily embarked, and in a mo&s;t liberal manner &s;ub|&s;cribed, to an undertaking, which, properly managed, would not have failed to have made a moderate return to them, and placed you in an affluent &s;ituation. The failure of it has &s;o far di&s;gu&s;ted me, that I am determined to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, every interference in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and to &s;ubject my&s;elf hereafter to as little trouble and lo&s;s as the ca&s;e will ad|mit.

<P>So much eva&s;ion opened my eyes; I felt my&s;elf duped, and what was wor&s;e, I felt I de&s;erved it: comforting my&s;elf, however, with the reflection, that <HI>being</HI> was &s;omething more
<PB N="63" REF="81">
honourable than <HI>having</HI> deceived, I wrote him the following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read your letter of the 23d with much attention, but &s;pight of my eager incli|nation to find in it any thing like friend&s;hip, kindne&s;s, or liberality, I di&s;cover only polite invective, plau&s;ible eva&s;ion, in&s;ulting civility, a haughty, cruel con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the inde|pendence of your &s;ituation, and an over&s;trained commi&s;eration for the lowne&s;s of mine. By this letter I am convinced of what I have been &s;o often told, and would never believe, that your profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip were a bubble blown up to amu&s;e me, and which would leave me nothing &s;ub&s;tantial but the mortifying knowledge of my own egregious folly; you &s;hall excu&s;e me, therefore, feel|ing it rather hard to &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf your dupe, if in pretty bold language I take the liberty to an&s;wer it. I well know that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Circus has been attended with a &s;eries of perplexing &s;ituations&mdash;that you have advanced above 2000l.&mdash;that my con|duct
<PB N="64" REF="82">
as manager of the concern has been pro|nounced the cau&s;e of the failure of the Cir|cus&mdash;that two out of five of the Proprietors have voted my expul&s;ion&mdash;for I do not ac|knowledge the competency of Mr. Bullock or Mr. We&s;t&mdash;that a majority are to deter|mine all matters of bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;that you have an opinion of my abilities&mdash;that you would have been glad had the project an&s;wered my expectation&mdash;that had it been properly managed it would have placed me in an af|fluent &s;ituation&mdash;and that you are &s;orry for and lament my misfortunes: But I know, and &s;o do you, that I am not the cau&s;e of the Circus's perplexities&mdash;that though you have advanced, you are not out of pocket 2000l.&mdash;that mine has been the only con&s;i&s;tent or proper conduct in the whole concern&mdash;that the expul&s;ion of the acknowledged manager for life is not a matter of bu&s;ine&s;s, but a thing impo&s;&s;ible to be done; therefore had your a&s;&s;ent given it &s;anction, the vote would have amounted to nothing&mdash;that however you may rate my portion of abilities, you think I have &s;till a larger one of credulity&mdash;that an affluent &s;ituation to me would have been rather more than a moderate return to
<PB N="65" REF="83">
the Proprietors; the fir&s;t ten per cent. being theirs, a hundred a year ground rent, a full half of the profits (which in &s;ix months cleared them 1800l.) the buildings, the im|provements, and the accumulating &s;tock; and la&s;tly, you know that your &s;orrow and lamen|tations over my misfortunes are no more than a con&s;cious reflection that you are the cau&s;e of them. It will &s;carcely be believed, that to u&s;urp my dramatic throne, and &s;end me to this indignant exile, &s;o flim&s;y, &s;o poor, &s;o bungling a pretext, as that of neglect, &s;hould be pitched upon. My judges, like tho&s;e of Socrates, are determined to condemn me right or wrong; this villainous philo&s;opher, &s;ay the latter, knows us too well, he &s;peaks profanely of our idols; he is a good man, to be &s;ure, the whole world admires him; but &s;ince it will only expo&s;e our own ignorance, or perhaps &s;omething wor&s;e, to inve&s;tigate the truth, let him die unheard. Thus &s;ay the Proprietors; there is no harm in this man, we have the highe&s;t opinion of his abilities, he has devoted more than two years to the Cir|cus, and we declared only la&s;t October, that, if the licence was not made out in his name,

Thus Socrates &s;wallowed the hem|lock, and I am expelled the Circus. Mine, however, is no more than a theatrical death; and you may be a&s;&s;ured, when the curtain has dropped upon your farce, I &s;hall ri&s;e again, and perform my part with more vigour than ever. To one &s;pecies of neglect I am ready to plead guilty; that neglect of having taken good care of my&s;elf; of having in&s;i&s;ted on mens bonds, who&s;e words were not to be tru&s;ted, and of receiving from you as a man of bu&s;ine&s;s, that which, under the ma&s;k of friend&s;hip, you promi&s;ed, without intention of performing.</P>
<P>But that I have failed to promote and for|ward the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Circus, or attended it with an a&s;&s;iduity beyond all example, I defy
<PB N="67" REF="85">
any of you to prove. If, however, it &s;hould appear, contrary to the kind expectation of tho&s;e characters &s;o remarkable for liberality, that I am not totally ruined, but able to pro|cure the means of carrying on an expen&s;ive &s;uit; this point a Court of Ju&s;tice will illuci|date; there the terrific menaces which u&s;ed to &s;care little children behind the &s;cenes,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Alluding to Mr. Harborne's Oration; which &s;ee in its place.</NOTE> make fidlers tremble in their orche&s;tra, hair-dre&s;&s;ers drop their curling-irons with a&s;toni&s;hment, and fright the Circus from its propriety, like ugly vizors at the hour of unma&s;king, will vani&s;h with all their di&s;tortion, and di&s;cover harmle&s;s, in&s;ipid countenances, looking for gratification, and finding di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, anticipate no argument intended for the mouth of my coun&s;el, but content my&s;elf with &s;hewing you, in a much &s;tronger light than I have hitherto repre&s;ented the matter, that you either have it in your power to do me ju&s;tice, or you mu&s;t be oblig|ed to confe&s;s your&s;elf guilty of a premeditated

ba&s;ene&s;s, neither con&s;i&s;tent with the character of a gentleman, or a man of honour.</P>
<P>When the draft of the &s;pecial agreement was delayed, and I apprehended &s;ome unplea|&s;ant con&s;equences, to quit me of my fears you made me this declaration:&mdash;Be perfectly ea&s;y; I do not &s;ay that the very words of that agree|ment which Mr. Sewell has drawn up &s;hall &s;tand in that to be executed, but it is &s;ettled among us, that the &s;pirit of that article &s;hall be faithfully adhered to, and all the emoluments and ad|vantages there &s;et down &s;hall be in&s;ured to you; and this declaration you prefaced with the following remarkable words:&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"If you can prove that I ever told a &s;erious lie, I give you leave to call me the greate&s;t villain that ever exi&s;ted."</Q> With the <HI>&s;ame</HI> preface, al&s;o, you made me a declaration, when it was re|ported you were about to part with your &s;hare; that you embarked in the bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;erve me; that you would &s;ee me e&s;tabli&s;hed in it for life; and that &s;ooner than &s;ell your &s;hare, or any part of it, the Circus &s;hould bring you to the King's Bench.

<P>The next news I heard was, that Mr. Grimaldi had the appointment of Manager in my &s;tead; and that Mr. Davis took by the hand that very Mr. Grimaldi, who he him&s;elf
<PB N="71" REF="89">
told me had endeavoured to poi&s;on the minds of the Proprietors again&s;t me; who he knew to have been guilty of very improper conduct; who he pretended he had the wor&s;t opinion of, and who he dete&s;ted, on account of his underhand treatment of me. As to Mr. Gri|maldi him&s;elf, he had made a parade of de|claring, that he conceived him&s;elf under the highe&s;t obligations to me; that I had given him his bread at the Circus, and he would ra|ther die, than do any thing that could militate again&s;t my intere&s;t; he, too, had a particular fancy to being called ra&s;cal, whenever he de|ceived me; but he need not be unea&s;y for me, he &s;hall peculate in peace, and &s;afely carry his crazy bones to that grave which yawns for them, where the highe&s;t compliment mankind can pay his a&s;hes, will be to throw on his memory the veil of oblivion.</P>
<P>I &s;hall detain the reader no longer than while I examine whether it appears that I neglected my duty at the Circus; whether, had that been the ca&s;e, the Proprietors were competent to di&s;mi&s;s me; and whether, by having voted me out, they have advantaged them&s;elves?</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="90">To the charge of neglect I an&s;wer, that I have given an indu&s;try &s;o indefatigable, an attention &s;o unremitted, that till la&s;t Chri&s;t|mas the Proprietors expre&s;&s;ed an a&s;toni&s;h|ment at my per&s;everance. I can &s;afely &s;ay, I devoted &s;ix hours in every day, upon an average, for near two years and a half, to &s;up|plying the Circus with materials; for I have not neglected to do &s;o even to this moment. I actually brought out there twenty-eight performances, twenty-one of which were en|tirely new. I wrote all adverti&s;ements, drew up &s;everal memorials and petitions, and gave directions in every department, except relative to the hor&s;es, for two years; nor out of the whole number of nights the Circus was open|ed, did I ab&s;ent my&s;elf more than about fifteen times, the major part of which omi&s;&s;ions was owing to the broken promi&s;es of Mr. Davis, in the name of the Proprietors, to my creditors.</P>
<P>A further way to &s;ee if I have been negli|gent, is to examine my conduct and Mr. Hughes's together. Have not the Proprietors complained, from the fir&s;t moment to the

la&s;t, that nothing could induce Mr. Hughes to produce any &s;ingle novelty? Did I not project &s;everal things for him? Are there not mate|rials for this u&s;e, prepared by my directions, as far back as July, 1782? And do not the Proprietors well know that one of my greate&s;t difficulties was continually to torture words into a variety of meanings, differently to an|nounce old manoeuvres in new adverti&s;ements. Is this the ca&s;e in relation to me?&mdash;&s;o far from it, that, be&s;ides what I have already men|tioned, &s;o much had I the intere&s;t of the place at heart, that when they were deter|mined to open at Chri&s;tmas, and I felt it could never do, I offered (without any emo|lument whatever, notwith&s;tanding I had long made a determination to the contrary, and thereby certainly given up many an advan|tageous &s;ituation) to write burlettas in a new &s;tile, and <HI>perform in them my&s;elf.</HI> Nay, being well convinced of the impo&s;&s;ibility of their providing proper novelty for the commence|ment of their &s;ea&s;on, I have repeatedly given them notice of many new performances that are actually now by me, and any three of which might have been performed on la&s;t

Ea&s;ter Monday; but they did not even deign to an&s;wer the&s;e notices.</P>
<P>It will ea&s;ily be &s;een then that I did &s;ome|thing more than Mr. Hughes; however I will do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that if I did my utmo&s;t, &s;o did he his.</P>
<P>Can this conduct then be called neglect, or is this a proper return to it? Is the exi&s;tence of a man in good profe&s;&s;ional e&s;timation thus to be &s;ported with? Is he to throw away two years of his time in fabricating a &s;cheme, &s;up|plying it with materials, watching the growth of its improvements, &s;uperintending and even teaching the performers, and giving it every advantage, perfectne&s;s, and con&s;e|quence? Is he to le&s;&s;en the reputation of his mu&s;ic by &s;uffering children to perform it, in|&s;tead of capital &s;ingers at the theatres? Is he to &s;hut him&s;elf out from every other concern, to decline all applications that have been and are now made to him? Is he to take back ac|cepted pieces from the theatres, which were &s;ure to yield him con&s;iderable profit? and is it rea&s;onable that all this care and pains, lo&s;s, and retirement from his former con&s;equence,
<PB N="75" REF="93" MS="y">
&s;hould be rewarded by an expul&s;ion from the very concern that but for him never would have had exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The Circus did not apply to me! I found no &s;uch place ready built to my hands! I projected it, fabricated it; it was the child of my own fancy; it was the harbour wherein I meant to moor my bark, as a haven again&s;t all the tempe&s;ts of fortune. Who could have believed that the in&s;idious pilot who &s;teered me to it &s;hould be the fir&s;t, after unlading my cargo, to &s;et me adrift to the buffeting waves of adver&s;ity, and the mercile&s;s winds of oppre&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>As to the competency of the Proprietors to vote me out of the Circus, unle&s;s contracts between man and man may be broken at will, the good faith and ingenuous reliance of one man upon the common hone&s;ty of another violated at plea&s;ure, and mens names &s;uffered to be affixed to paper merely as a mockery of ju&s;tice, that competency I think will not be ea&s;ily proved.</P>
<P>The Proprietors will not deny that it was a very common thing for one of them to un|dertake
<PB N="76" REF="94">
for the re&s;t; they were collectively liable as in matter of partner&s;hip; Mr. Har|borne has often accepted drafts for the con|cern, &s;o has Mr. Davis, exactly in the man|ner he wrote his name to the memorandum, which in&s;trument, like the agreement of a lea&s;e, is efficient till the lea&s;e it&s;elf is drawn up; and as a proof that the memorandum was compul&s;ory, a &s;pecial deed was actually pre|pared, and but that it exacted more than the agreement which compelled it, would have been &s;igned.</P>
<P>As to the remaining que&s;tion, unle&s;s con|fu&s;ion is better than order, &s;tale performances more attractive than novelty, and empty hou&s;es more profitable than full ones, the Circus is not at this moment benefited by my ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>For the re&s;t, it is well the Proprietors can boa&s;t of the independency of their fortunes, &s;ince they have &s;uch poverty of &s;pirit. I can|not omit one caution, however: let it not be believed, becau&s;e thou&s;ands are ea&s;ily talked <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The difference of the profits this year and la&s;t, as I can prove by the receipts, is upon an average up|wards of 180l. a week.</NOTE>

of, &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums have been expended in the Circus as the world is taught to ima|gine; it co&s;t enough, and it is pity they had not paid dearer for the folly of neglecting wole&s;ome advice.</P>
<P>Neither will it I hope be credited, that I have received upwards of 2000l. from the Circus, or that I am 3000l. in debt. Upon the faith and honour of a man, previous to la&s;t Augu&s;t, I had received no more than about 1100l. and &s;ince that time only 50l. or 60l. at mo&s;t;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I cannot be exactly correct, for Mr. Hughes, by virtue of <HI>the very legal</HI> &s;eizure he made in my hou&s;e, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every private paper I had in the world.</NOTE> out of all which I paid near 700l. and maintained my&s;elf and my family &s;ince the month of October eighty|one; and I &s;hould not at this moment owe more than 100l. had I not been embarra&s;&s;ed as I before de&s;cribed, whereas I am indebted near five.</P>
<P>Thus have I brought this narrative to a conclu&s;ion. I pledge my&s;elf for the truth of it, and call upon the Public (the neglect of my duty to whom is of con&s;equence to me

indeed, compared to the opinion of the Pro|prietors of the Circus) to brand me with in|gratitude to them, and point me out as an object unde&s;erving their future &s;upport, if I am detected of having advanced a &s;ingle fal|&s;ity.</P>
<P>Much &s;ubordinate matter, I confe&s;s, re|mains behind, which I thought unworthy of public in&s;pection; but if the Proprietors feel bold, I throw down my guantlet, and dare them to meet me upon that, or any other ground. Indeed I believe, at this hour, if it was not for &s;hame, they would &s;end for me to meet them at the Circus. They need not be un|happy; the law will do that for them, which they have not the re&s;olution to do for them|&s;elves; and whenever it happens, they may be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall be mo&s;t unmercifully re|venged of them; I will &s;ubmit to no whim or caprice, but go on in the exerci&s;e of my own judgment. If I wi&s;h to expo&s;e the temple of chicane, lay open its ra&s;cally rece&s;&s;es, and re&s;cue the innocent victims bound at its altars, I will not flinch from my de&s;ign, even though Mr. Harborne happens to be an attorney. I'll not &s;cruple to tell the world, that hor&s;e|racing

is not a moral duty; Pharoah, a &s;y&s;tem of Philo&s;ophy, or Cock-fighting, a &s;tudy of humanity; even though Sir John Lade and Mr. Davis are gentlemen of the Turf. In &s;hort, if in&s;tead of five I had five hundred Proprietors to deal with, all of different per|&s;ua&s;ions, profe&s;&s;ions, and affections, I will boldly per&s;evere in furni&s;hing &s;uch materials as I &s;hall conceive mo&s;t condu&s;ive to amu&s;e the town, and profit the concern; nor will I con&s;ider any neglect a crime, or bow to any correction, but that of the generous and can|did Public.</P>
