<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE STORY on which the following DRAMA is founded, however defective, is not borrowed&mdash;Various curtailments, and tran&s;po&s;itions of Scenes, have unavoidably deranged the unities of the Piece, for the convenience of Stage repre&s;en|tation. Several of the AIRS, and all the CHORUSES having been written to compiled Mu&s;ic, the critical reader will make a &s;uitable indulgence for &s;ome irregular, and uncouth numbers, which he will nece&s;&s;arily meet with.</P>
<P>The AUTHOR has too high a &s;en&s;e of the zealous exer|tions of his whole DRAMATIS PERSONAE, to make any di&s;tinction in that general tribute of thanks, which he gratefully pays to their united merit. To Mr. SHIELD, he is indebted on this occa&s;ion, for every thing that friend|&s;hip, and profe&s;&s;ional talent, could contribute.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;ages omitted on the Stage, are marked with inverted Commas.</P>
