<HEAD>A PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>READING the paper lately at breakfa&s;t, I &s;aw an account of the &s;plendid ceremonies u&s;ed at Pitcairne Green, in Scotland, on marking the boundaries of an exten&s;ive village to be erected on that &s;pot, for the purpo&s;e of introducing the Lanca&s;hire manufactures. The&s;e ceremonies were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the per&s;ons of con&s;equence, of each &s;ex, in that part of the kingdom;&mdash;among&s;t the Ladies were Mrs. Graham, Lady C. Graham, &amp;c. &amp;c. As my eye ran it over, it dropt a tear on the pa&s;&s;age. It mu&s;t have appeared ridiculous enough, for there was certainly nothing very moving in it:&mdash;however, I have ven|tured to give both the tear and the feelings which made it &s;tart, to the Genius of the place. I wrote merely to appea&s;e my &s;en&s;a|tions; and having written (according to the old &s;tory) my friends
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
advi&s;ed me to publi&s;h; and they are obeyed. If the public &s;hould not find the trifle intere&s;ting, they will at lea&s;t do it the ju&s;tice to let it &s;lide into oblivion, and forgive (I tru&s;t) the few hours the compo&s;ition co&s;t me.</P>
<P>The little work has not been without its difficulties. My can|vas was to hint a Land&s;cape&mdash;a Land&s;cape in a country which I had never &s;een. The accounts pre&s;ented by travellers might be fal&s;e, or they might be invidious, yet <HI>they</HI> were to govern me! Notwith&s;tanding I yielded to this, images very di&s;&s;imilar crouded to my pen; the pro&s;pects of Devon&mdash;dear native &s;cenes! were for ever before me; and all my recollection was nece&s;&s;ary, to prevent the tears of Dryades from falling for the lo&s;s of their &s;hades, and the Nightingale from pouring its regrets, that its ancient habitations were invaded.</P>
<P>Had the &s;cite of the intended village been in that province, de&s;cription would have had room to range;&mdash;fancy might have rioted, and the mo&s;t luxuriant imagination &s;ated it&s;elf. There, a poet might have led his readers through verdant lanes (for &s;o in other counties Devon's <HI>turnpikes</HI> would be named) where the high hedges compo&s;ed of hawthorn, &s;weet-brier, myrtle,
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
and a thou&s;and flowers, effectually &s;creens the traveller from the mo&s;t &s;ultry &s;un,&mdash;there, through the breaks, a country pre&s;ents it&s;elf, all enchantment! and where, if the Cottager did not boa&s;t views as delightful as the Nabob and the Patrician, the whole province might be mi&s;taken for one va&s;t artificial plea&s;ure-ground. Whil&s;t the ear is filled with all the mu&s;ic, poured from the throats of the goldfinch, the black|bird, and the thru&s;h, the eye ince&s;&s;antly wanders over painted meads, and roves from hill to dale&mdash;re&s;ts on the &s;oft foliage of &s;loping woods, and pur&s;ues the &s;erpentine of pellucid ri|vers;&mdash;beholds fields of burni&s;hed corn waving like a golden &s;ea, to the tremulous breeze; and orchards loaden with &s;uch fruit, as makes the &s;tory of the He&s;perides &s;carcely &s;eem a fable.</P>
<P>This little &s;ketch (literal, not poetical) is for the information of tho&s;e of my friends in Scotland, who have not yet cro&s;&s;ed the Tweed; and to &s;ugge&s;t to them when they do, not to re|turn per&s;uaded of having &s;een the land&s;capes of England, un|le&s;s they have travelled through Dor&s;et&s;hire, Somer&s;et, and DEVON.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="6">
It has been told to me, that this village, and Doctor Gold&s;mith's will be contra&s;ted&mdash;I earne&s;tly deprecate &s;o fatal a compari&s;on! Gold&s;mith's is the poem of a Politician, and &s;oars with a &s;trong wing!&mdash;mine is a butterfly fluttering over the field, and here and there repo&s;ing on a cow&s;lip, or a dai&s;ey. <HI>That</HI> was de|fended from critici&s;m by its magnitude; may <HI>this</HI> find &s;afety in its littlene&s;s!</P>
