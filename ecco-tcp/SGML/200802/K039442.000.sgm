<HEAD><HI>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE the</HI> Counte&s;s of <HI>Hertford.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PErmit me to hope that you will pardon the hone&s;t ambition which has encourag'd me to &s;eek a proper Patrone&s;s for <HI>Marina</HI> in your Lady&s;hip; who&s;e real cha|racter gives countenance to the imagi|nary one, and who&s;e con&s;tant practice is a living example of that &s;teady vir|tue, and exalted piety, which the Au|thor of the old Play from whence this is taken, has happily de&s;cribed in his <HI>Prince&s;s of Tyre.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;cious of no mean views, and &s;ecur'd by the univer&s;al acknowledg|ment
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
of your merit from the imputa|tion of flattery, I approach your Lady|&s;hip, though a &s;tranger, and without any previous application, with the le&s;s diffidence: If this Play &s;hould appear on peru&s;al to be de&s;igned to promote &s;omething better than meer amu&s;e|ment, that will effectually recommend it to the favour of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Hertford.</HI></P>
<P>To place merit in the gifts of fortune, and happine&s;s in what an hour may, and a few years certainly will bring to an end, is the folly and mi&s;ery of too many who are reputed wi&s;e and great. To be truly &s;o is with your Lady&s;hip to regard the fine&s;t under&s;tanding, the mo&s;t fruitful invention, the happie&s;t elocution, talents far &s;uperior to wealth and dignity, but as they &s;ub&s;erve the intere&s;t of truth and virtue, and ren|der the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them, in the mid&s;t of affluence, moderate even in the u&s;e of lawful plea&s;ures, humble in the
<PB N="v" REF="4">
mo&s;t exalted &s;tations, and capable of living above the world, even in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all it can be&s;tow. I am afraid and unwilling to offend. But as univer&s;al benevolence is the perfe|ction of virtue, your Lady&s;hip mu&s;t &s;uffer your own to be &s;poken of, how|ever painful it may be to you, that others may not want a pattern for their encouragement or reprehen&s;ion, as they &s;hall improve or neglect it. A truly great mind di&s;covers it &s;elf by nothing more than by a benign and well plac'd conde&s;cen&s;ion; of which your Lady&s;hip's known e&s;teem for the late excellent Mrs. <HI>Rowe,</HI> is a noble in&s;tance, and an undoubted proof, among&s;t many others which you daily give, of the goodne&s;s of your heart and under&s;tanding, and cannot be mentioned but to your honour.</P>
<P>I can affirm, and I hope I &s;hall be thought &s;incere, that what I have &s;aid doth not proceed from cu&s;tom as a
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
Dedicator, but from a mind fully convinc'd of its truth in every circum|&s;tance, and a heart touch'd with a character &s;o very amiable.</P>
<P>That you may long live an orna|ment and a &s;upport of tho&s;e excellent principles which you profe&s;s and pra|ctice, and that your influence and example may do all the good that you your &s;elf can wi&s;h, is the earne&s;t de|&s;ire of,</P>

<L>HARD is the task, in this di&s;cerning age,</L>
<L>To find new &s;ubjects that will bear the &s;tage;</L>
<L>And bold our bards, their low har&s;h &s;trains to bring</L>
<L>Where <HI>Avon</HI>'s Swan has long been heard to &s;ing:</L>
<L>Ble&s;t Parent of our Scene! who&s;e matchle&s;s wit,</L>
<L>Tho' yearly reap'd, is our be&s;t harve&s;t yet.</L>
<L>Well may that genius every heart command,</L>
<L>Who drew all nature with her own &s;trong hand;</L>
<L>As various, as harmonious, fair and great,</L>
<L>With the &s;ame vigour and immortal heat,</L>
<L>As through each element and form &s;he &s;hines:</L>
<L>We view Heav'ns hand-maid in her <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s lines.</L>
<L>Though &s;ome mean &s;cenes, injurious to his fame,</L>
<L>Have long u&s;urp'd the honour of his Name;</L>
<L>To glean and clear from chaff his lea&s;t remains,</L>
<L>Is ju&s;t to him, and richly worth our pains.</L>
<L>We dare not charge the whole unequal play</L>
<L>Of <HI>Pericles</HI> on him; yet let us &s;ay,</L>
<L>As gold though mix'd with ba&s;er matter &s;hines,</L>
<L>So do his bright inimitable lines</L>
<L>Throughout tho&s;e rude wild &s;cenes di&s;tingui&s;h'd &s;tand,</L>
<L>And &s;how he touch'd them with no &s;paring hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With humour mix'd in your fore-fathers way,</L>
<L>We've to a &s;ingle tale reduc'd our play.</L>
<L>Charming <HI>Marina</HI>'s wrongs begin the &s;cene;</L>
<L><HI>Pericles</HI> finding her with his lo&s;t Queen,</L>
<L>Concludes the plea&s;ing task. Shou'd as the &s;oul,</L>
<L>The fire of <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> animate the whole,</L>
<L>Shou'd heights which none but he cou'd reach, appear,</L>
<L>To little errors do not prove &s;evere.</L>
<L>If, when in pain for the event, &s;urprize</L>
<L>And &s;ympathetick joy &s;hou'd fill your eyes;</L>
<L>Do not repine that &s;o you crown an art,</L>
<L>Which gives &s;uch &s;weet emotions to the heart:</L>
<L>Who&s;e plea&s;ures, &s;o exalted in their kind,</L>
<L>Do, as they charm the &s;en&s;e, improve the mind.</L>

<P>Nay, nay, if they will turn iniquity out of the high-ways, they mu&s;t expect to find it in their families. Let them keep their Wives and Daughters hone&s;t if they can. The nece&s;&s;ities of Gentlemen mu&s;t be &s;upply'd.</P>
