<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON A LATE STATE OF THE NATION.</HEAD>
<P>PARTY divi&s;ions, whether on the whole operat|ing for good or evil, are things in&s;eparable from free government. This is a truth which, I believe, admits little di&s;pute, having been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the uniform experience of all ages. The part a good citizen ought to take in the&s;e divi&s;ions, has been a matter of much deeper controver&s;y. But God for|bid, that any controver&s;y relating to our e&s;&s;ential morals &s;hould admit of no deci&s;ion. It appears to me, that this que&s;tion, like mo&s;t of the others which regard our duties in life, is to be determined by our &s;tation in it. Private men may be wholly neu|tral, and entirely innocent: but they who are le|gally inve&s;ted with public tru&s;t, or &s;tand on the high ground of rank and dignity, which is tru&s;t implied, can hardly in any ca&s;e remain indifferent, without the certainty of &s;inking into in&s;ignificance; and thereby in effect de&s;erting that po&s;t in which, with the fulle&s;t authority, and for the wi&s;e&s;t pur|po&s;es, the laws and in&s;titutions of their country have fixed them. However, if it be the office of tho&s;e who are thus circum&s;tanced, to take a decid|ed
<PB N="2" REF="7">
part, it is no le&s;s their duty that it &s;hould be a &s;ober one. It ought to be circum&s;cribed by the &s;ame laws of decorum, and balanced by the &s;ame temper, which bound and regulate all the virtues. In a word, we ought to act in party with all the moderation which does not ab&s;olutely enervate that vigour, and quench that fervency of &s;pirit, without which the be&s;t wi&s;hes for the public good mu&s;t evaporate in empty &s;peculation.</P>
<P>IT is probably from &s;ome &s;uch motives that the friends of a very re&s;pectable party in this kingdom have been hitherto &s;ilent. For the&s;e two years pa&s;t, from one and the &s;ame quarter of politics, a conti|nual fire has been kept upon them; &s;ometimes from the unwieldy column of quartos and octavos; &s;ome|times from the light &s;quadrons of occa&s;ional pam|phlets and flying &s;heets. Every month has brought on its periodical calumny. The abu&s;e has taken every &s;hape which the ability of the writers could give it; plain invective, clum&s;y raillery, mi&s;repre|&s;ented anecdote.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Minority. Hi&s;tory of the Repeal of the Stamp-act. Con&s;iderations on Trade and Finances. Political Regi&s;ter, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> No method of vilifying the mea|&s;ures, the abilities, the intentions, or the per&s;ons which compo&s;e that body, has been omitted.</P>
<P>ON their part nothing was oppo&s;ed but patience and character. It was a matter of the mo&s;t &s;erious and indignant affliction to per&s;ons, who thought them&s;elves in con&s;cience bound to oppo&s;e a mini&s;try, dangerous from its very con&s;titution, as well as its mea&s;ures, to find them&s;elves, whenever they faced their adver&s;aries, continually attacked on the rear by a &s;et of men, who pretended to be actuated by motives &s;imilar to theirs. They &s;aw that the plan long pur&s;ued, with but too fatal a &s;ucce&s;s, was to break the &s;trength of this kingdom; by frittering down the bodies which compo&s;e it; by fomenting
<PB N="3" REF="8">
bitter and &s;anguinary animo&s;ities, and by di&s;&s;olving every tie of &s;ocial affection and public tru&s;t. The&s;e virtuous men, &s;uch I am warranted by public opinion to call them, were re&s;olved rather to endure every thing, than co-operate in that de&s;ign. A diver&s;ity of opinion upon almo&s;t every principle of politics had indeed drawn a &s;trong line of &s;eparation between them and &s;ome others. However, they were de&s;irous not to extend the misfortune by unnece&s;&s;ary bitter|ne&s;s; they wi&s;hed to prevent a difference of opinion on the commonwealth from fe&s;tering into rancorous and incurable ho&s;tility. Accordingly they endea|voured that all pa&s;t controver&s;ies &s;hould be for|gotten; and that enough for the day &s;hould be the evil thereof. There is however a limit at which for|bearance cea&s;es to be a virtue. Men may tolerate injuries, whil&s;t they are only per&s;onal to them&s;elves. But it is not the fir&s;t of virtues to bear with modera|tion the indignities that are offered to our country. A piece has at length appeared, from the quarter of all the former attacks, which upon every public con&s;ideration demands an an&s;wer. Whil&s;t per&s;ons more equal to this bu&s;ine&s;s may be engaged in affairs of greater moment, I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed, if, in a few hours of a time not very important, and from &s;uch materials as I have by me (more than enough however for this purpo&s;e), I undertake to &s;et the facts and arguments of this wonderful performance in a proper light. I will endeavour to &s;tate what this piece is; the purpo&s;e for which I take it to have been written; and the effects (&s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould have any effect at all) it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily produce.</P>
<P>THIS piece is called, <HI>The pre&s;ent State of the Na|tion.</HI> It may be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of dige&s;t of the avowed maxims of a certain political &s;chool, the effects of who&s;e doctrines and practices this country will feel long and &s;everely. It is made up of a far|rago of almo&s;t every topic which has been agitated
<PB N="4" REF="9">
in parliamentary debate, or private conver&s;ation, on national affairs, for the&s;e &s;even la&s;t years. The olde&s;t controver&s;ies are hawled out of the du&s;t with which time and neglect had covered them. Arguments ten times repeated, a thou&s;and times an&s;wered before, are here repeated again. Public accounts formerly printed and re-printed revolve once more, and find their old &s;tation in this &s;ober meridian. All the com|mon-place lamentations upon the decay of trade, the encrea&s;e of taxes, and the high price of labour and provi&s;ions, are here retailed again and again in the &s;ame tone with which they have drawled through columns of Gazetteers and Adverti&s;ers for a century together. Paradoxes which affront common &s;en&s;e, and unintere&s;ting barren truths which generate no conclu&s;ion, are thrown in to augment unwieldy bulk, without adding any thing to weight. Becau&s;e two accu&s;ations are better than one, contradictions are &s;et &s;taring one another in the face, without even an attempt to reconcile them. And to give the whole a &s;ort of portentous air of labour and infor|mation, the table of the hou&s;e of commons is &s;wept into this grand re&s;ervoir of politics.</P>
<P>AS to the compo&s;ition, it bears a &s;triking and whim&s;ical re&s;emblance to a funeral &s;ermon, not only in the pathetic prayer with which it concludes, but in the &s;tyle and tenor of the whole performance. It is piteou&s;ly doleful, nodding every now and then towards dulne&s;s; well &s;tored with pious frauds, and, like mo&s;t di&s;cour&s;es of the &s;ort, much better calcu|lated for the private advantage of the preacher than the edification of the hearers.</P>
<P>THE author has indeed &s;o involved his &s;ubject, that it is frequently far from being ea&s;y to com|prehend his meaning. It is happy for the public that it is never difficult to fathom his de&s;ign. The apparent intention of this author is to draw the mo&s;t aggravated, hideous, and deformed picture of the
<PB N="5" REF="10">
&s;tate of this country, which his querulous eloquence, aided by the arbitrary dominion he a&s;&s;umes over fact, is capable of exhibiting. Had he attributed our mi&s;|fortunes to their true cau&s;e, the injudicious tamper|ing of bold, improvident, and vi&s;ionary mini&s;ters at one period, or to their &s;upine negligence and traiter|ous di&s;&s;en&s;ions at another, the complaint had been ju&s;t, and might have been u&s;eful. But far the greater and much the wor&s;t part of the &s;tate which he ex|hibits is owing, according to his repre&s;entation, not to accidental and extrin&s;ic mi&s;chiefs attendant on the nation, but to its radical weakne&s;s and con&s;titu|tional di&s;tempers. All this however is not without purpo&s;e. The author is in hopes that, when we are fallen into a fanatical terror for the national &s;alvation, we &s;hall then be ready to throw our&s;elves, in a &s;ort of precipitate tru&s;t, &s;ome &s;trange di&s;po&s;ition of the mind jumbled up of pre&s;umption and de&s;pair, into the hands of the mo&s;t pretending and forward un|dertaker. One &s;uch undertaker at lea&s;t he has in readine&s;s for our &s;ervice. But let me a&s;&s;ure this ge|nerous per&s;on, that, however he may &s;ucceed in exciting our fears for the public danger, he will find it hard indeed to engage us to place any con|fidence in the &s;y&s;tem he propo&s;es for our &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>HIS undertaking is great. The purpo&s;e of this pamphlet, and at which it aims directly or obliquely in every page, is to per&s;uade the public of three or four of the mo&s;t difficult points in the world, that all the advantages of the late war were on the part of the Bourbon alliance; that the peace of Paris perfectly con&s;ulted the dignity and intere&s;t of this country; and that the American &s;tamp-act was a ma&s;ter-piece of policy and finance; that the only good mini&s;ter this nation has enjoyed &s;ince his ma|je&s;ty's acce&s;&s;ion, is the earl of Bute; and the only good managers of revenue we have &s;een are lord De&s;pen&s;er and Mr. George Grenville; and under the
<PB N="6" REF="11">
de&s;cription of men of virtue and ability, he holds them out to us as the only per&s;ons fit to put our affairs in order. Let not the reader mi&s;take me: he does not actually name the&s;e per&s;ons; but, having highly applauded their conduct in all its parts, and heavily cen&s;ured every other &s;et of men in the king|dom, he then recommends us to his men of virtue and ability.</P>
<P>SUCH is the author's &s;cheme. Whether it will an&s;wer his purpo&s;e, I know not. But &s;urely that purpo&s;e ought to be a wonderfully good one, to warrant the methods he has taken to compa&s;s it. If the facts and rea&s;onings in this piece are admitted, it is all over with us. The continuance of our tran|quillity depends upon the compa&s;&s;ion of our rivals. Unable to &s;ecure to our&s;elves the advantages of peace, we are at the &s;ame time utterly unfit for war. It is impo&s;&s;ible, if this &s;tate of things be credited abroad, that we can have any alliance; all nations will fly from &s;o dangerous a connexion, le&s;t, in&s;tead of being partakers of our &s;trength, they &s;hould only become &s;harers in our ruin. If it is believed at home, all that firmne&s;s of mind, and dignified na|tional courage, which u&s;ed to be the great &s;upport of this i&s;le again&s;t the powers of the world, mu&s;t melt away, and fail within us.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a &s;tate of things can it be ami&s;s, if I aim at holding out &s;ome comfort to the nation; another &s;ort of comfort indeed, than that which this writer provides for it; a comfort, not from its phy&s;ician, but from its con&s;titution; if I attempt to &s;hew that all the arguments upon which he founds the decay of that con&s;titution, and the nece&s;&s;ity of that phy|&s;ician, are vain and frivolous? I will follow the au|thor clo&s;ely in his own long career, through the war, the peace, the finances, our trade, and our foreign politics: not for the &s;ake of the particular mea&s;ures which he di&s;cu&s;&s;es; that can be of no u&s;e; they are
<PB N="7" REF="12">
all decided; their good is all enjoyed, or their evil incurred: but for the &s;ake of the principles of war, peace, trade, and finances. The&s;e principles are of infinite moment. They mu&s;t come again and again under con&s;ideration; and it imports the public, of all things, that tho&s;e of its mini&s;ter be enlarged, and ju&s;t, and well confirmed, upon all the&s;e &s;ubjects. What notions this author entertains, we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently; notions in my opinion very irrational, and extremely dangerous; and which, if they &s;hould crawl from pamphlets into coun&s;els, and be realiz|ed from private &s;peculation into national mea&s;ures, cannot fail of ha&s;tening and compleating our ruin.</P>
<P>THIS author, after having paid his compliment to the &s;hewy appearances of the late war in our fa|vour, is in the utmo&s;t ha&s;te to tell you that the&s;e appearances were <HI>fallacious,</HI> that they were no more than an <HI>impo&s;ition.</HI>&mdash;I fear I mu&s;t trouble the reader with a pretty long quotation, in order to &s;et before him the more clearly this author's peculiar way of conceiving and rea&s;oning:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"HAPPILY (the K.) was then advi&s;ed by mini&s;ters, who did not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be dazzled by the glare of brilliant appearances; but, knowing them to be <HI>fallacious,</HI> they wi&s;ely re&s;olved to profit of their &s;plendor before our enemies &s;hould al&s;o <HI>di&s;cover the impo&s;ition.</HI>&mdash;The increa&s;e in the ex|ports was found to have been occa&s;ioned chiefly by the demands of <HI>our own fleets and armies,</HI> and, in&s;tead of bringing wealth to the nation, were to be paid for by oppre&s;&s;ive taxes upon the people of England. While the Briti&s;h &s;eamen were con&s;uming on board our men of war and privateers, foreign &s;hips and foreign &s;eamen were employed in the tran&s;portation of our merchandize, and the car|rying trade, &s;o great a &s;ource of wealth and ma|rine, <HI>was entirely engro&s;&s;ed by the neutral nations.</HI> The number of Briti&s;h &s;hips annually arriving in
<PB N="8" REF="13">
our ports was reduced 1756 &s;ail, containing 92,559 tons, on a medium of the &s;ix years war, compared with the &s;ix years of peace preceding it.&mdash;The conque&s;t of the Havannah had, indeed, &s;topped the remittance of &s;pecie from Mexico to Spain; but it had not enabled England to &s;eize it: on the contrary, our merchants &s;uffered by the detention of the galleons, as their <HI>corre&s;pondents in Spain were di&s;abled from paying them for their goods &s;ent to America. The lo&s;s of the trade to Old Spain was a farther bar to an influx of &s;pecie</HI>; and the attempt upon Portugal had not only deprived us of an import of bullion from thence, but the payment of our troops employed in its defence was a fre&s;h drain opened for the diminution of our circulating &s;pecie.&mdash;The high premiums given for new loans had &s;unk the price of the old &s;tock near a third of its original value, &s;o that the purcha&s;ers had an obligation from the &s;tate to repay them with an addition of 33 <HI>per cent.</HI> to their capital. Every new loan required new taxes to be impo&s;ed; new taxes mu&s;t add to the price of our manufactures, <HI>and le&s;&s;en their con&s;umption among foreigners.</HI> The decay of our trade mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily <HI>occa&s;ion a de|crea&s;e of the public revenue</HI>; and a deficiency of our funds mu&s;t either be made up by fre&s;h taxes, which would only add to the calamity, or our na|tional credit mu&s;t be de&s;troyed, by &s;hewing the public creditors the inability of the nation to re|pay them their principal money.&mdash;Bounties had already been given for recruits which exceeded the year's wages of the plowman and reaper; and as the&s;e were exhau&s;ted, and <HI>hu&s;bandry &s;tood &s;till for want of hands,</HI> the manufacturers were next to be tempted to quit the anvil and the loom by higher offers.&mdash;<HI>France, bankrupt France, had no &s;uch cala|mities impending over her; her di&s;tre&s;&s;es were great, but they were immediate and temporary; her want of credit pre&s;erved her from a great increa&s;e of debt, and</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="14">
<HI>the lo&s;s of her ultramarine dominions le&s;&s;ened her expen|ces. Her colonies had, indeed, put them&s;elves into the hands of the Engli&s;h; but the property of her &s;ubjects had been pre&s;erved by capitulations, and a way opened for making her tho&s;e remittances; which the war had before &s;u&s;pended, with as much &s;ecurity as in time of peace.</HI>&mdash;Her armies in Germany had been hitherto prevented from &s;eizing upon Hanover; but they continued to encamp on the &s;ame ground on which the fir&s;t battle was fought; and, as it mu&s;t ever happen from the policy of that government, <HI>the la&s;t troops &s;he &s;ent into the field were always found to be the be&s;t, and her frequent lo&s;&s;es only &s;erved to fill her regiments with better &s;oldiers. The conque&s;t of Hanover became therefore every campaign more pro|bable.</HI> It is to be noted, that the French troops received &s;ub&s;i&s;tance only, for the la&s;t three years of the war; and that, although large arrears were due to them at its conclu&s;ion, the charge was the le&s;s during its continuance."<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P. 6, 7, 8.9.10.</NOTE></Q> </P>
<P>IF any one be willing to &s;ee to how much greater lengths the author carries the&s;e ideas, he will recur to the book. This is &s;ufficient for a &s;pecimen of his manner of thinking. I believe one reflection uniformly obtrudes it&s;elf upon every reader of the&s;e paragraphs. For what purpo&s;e in any cau&s;e &s;hall we hereafter contend with France? can we ever flatter our&s;elves that we &s;hall wage a more &s;ucce&s;s|ful war? if, on our part, in a war the mo&s;t pro&s;|perous we ever carried on, by &s;ea and by land, and in every part of the globe, attended with the un|paralleled circum&s;tance of an immen&s;e increa&s;e of trade and augmentation of revenue; if a continued &s;eries of di&s;appointments, di&s;graces, and defeats, fol|lowed by public bankruptcy, on the part of France; if all the&s;e &s;till leave her a gainer on the whole balance, will it not be downright phrenzy in us ever
<PB N="10" REF="15">
to look her in the face again, or to contend with her any, even the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points, &s;ince vic|tory and defeat, though by different ways, equally conduct us to our ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n? Subjection to France with|out a &s;truggle will indeed be le&s;s for our honour, but on every principle of our author it mu&s;t be more for our advantage. According to his repre|&s;entation of things, the que&s;tion is only concerning the mo&s;t ea&s;y fall. France had not di&s;covered, our &s;tate&s;man tells us, at the end of that war, the triumphs of defeat, and the re&s;ources which are derived from bankruptcy. For my poor part, I do not wonder at their blindne&s;s. But the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters &s;aw further. Our author has at length let foreigners al&s;o into the &s;ecret, and made them altogether as wi&s;e as our&s;elves. It is their own fault if (<HI>vulgato imperii arcano</HI>) they are impo&s;ed upon any longer. They now are apprized of the &s;enti|ments which the great candidate for the govern|ment of this great empire entertains; and they will act accordingly. They are taught our weakne&s;s and their own advantages.</P>
<P>HE tells the world,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">P. 9, 10.</NOTE> that if France carries on the war again&s;t us in Germany, every lo&s;s &s;he &s;u&s;|tains contributes to the atchievement of her con|que&s;t. If her armies are three years unpaid, &s;he is the le&s;s exhau&s;ted by expence. If her credit is de|&s;troyed, &s;he is the le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed with debt. If her troops are cut to pieces, they will by her policy (and a wonderful policy it is) be improved, and will be &s;upplied with much better men. If the war is carried on in the colonies, he tells them that the lo&s;s of her ultramarine dominions le&s;&s;ens her ex|pences,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">P. 9.</NOTE> and en&s;ures her remittances:
<Q><L>Per damna, per caedes, ab ip&s;o</L>
<L>Ducit opes animumque ferro.</L></Q>
if &s;o, what is it we can do to hurt her?&mdash;It will
<PB N="11" REF="16">
be all an <HI>impo&s;ition,</HI> all <HI>fallacious.</HI> Why the re&s;ult mu&s;t be&mdash;<HI>Occidit, occidit &s;pes omnis &amp; fortuna no&s;tri nominis.</HI></P>
<P>THE only way which the author's principles leave for our e&s;cape, is to rever&s;e our condition into that of France, and to take her lo&s;ing cards into our hands. But, though his principles drive him to it, his politics will not &s;uffer him to walk on this ground. Talking at our ea&s;e and of other countries, we may bear to be diverted with &s;uch &s;peculations; but in England we &s;hall never be taught to look upon the annihilation of our trade, the ruin of our credit, the defeat of our armies, and the lo&s;s of our ultramarine dominions, (whatever the author may think of them,) to be the high road to pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE reader does not, I hope, imagine that I mean &s;eriou&s;ly to &s;et about the refutation of the&s;e uninge|nious paradoxes and reveries without imagination. I &s;tate them only that we may di&s;cern a little in the que&s;tions of war and peace, the mo&s;t weighty of all que&s;tions, what is the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e men who are held out to us as the only hope of an ex|piring nation. The pre&s;ent mini&s;try is indeed of a &s;trange character: at once indolent and di&s;tract|ed. But if a mini&s;terial &s;y&s;tem &s;hould be formed, actuated by &s;uch maxims as are avowed in this piece, the vices of the pre&s;ent mini&s;try would be|come their virtues; their indolence would be the greate&s;t of all public benefits, and a di&s;traction that entirely defeated every one of their &s;chemes would be our only &s;ecurity from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>TO have &s;tated the&s;e rea&s;onings is enough, I pre&s;ume, to do their bu&s;ine&s;s. But they are ac|companied with facts and records, which may &s;eem of a little more weight. I tru&s;t however that the facts of this author will be as far from
<PB N="12" REF="17">
bearing the touch&s;tone, as his arguments. On a little inquiry, they will be found as great an im|po&s;ition as the &s;ucce&s;&s;es they are meant to depre|ciate; for they are all either fal&s;e or fallaciou&s;ly applied; or not in the lea&s;t to the purpo&s;e for which they are produced.</P>
<P>FIRST the author, in order to &s;upport his fa|vourite paradox, that our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French colonies was of no detriment to France, has thought proper to inform us that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they put them&s;elves into the hands of the Engli&s;h."<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 9.</NOTE></Q>
 He u&s;es the &s;ame a&s;&s;ertion, in nearly the &s;ame words, in another place; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"her colonies had put them&s;elves into our hands."<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE></Q> Now, in ju&s;tice not only to fact and common &s;en&s;e, but to the incomparable valour and per&s;everance of our military and naval forces thus unhand&s;omely traduced, I mu&s;t tell this author, that the French colonies did not
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"put them&s;elves into the hands of the Engli&s;h."</Q>
They were compelled to &s;ub|mit; they were &s;ubdued by dint of Engli&s;h valour. Will the five years war carried on in Canada, in which fell one of the principal hopes of this na|tion, and all the battles lo&s;t and gained during that anxious period, convince this author of his mi&s;take? Let him inquire of Sir Jeffery Amher&s;t, under who&s;e conduct that war was carried on; of Sir Charles Saunders, who&s;e &s;teadine&s;s and pre&s;ence of mind &s;aved our fleet, and were &s;o eminently &s;erviceable in the whole cour&s;e of the &s;iege of Quebec; of general Monckton, who was &s;hot through the body there, whether France
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"put her colonies into the hands of the Engli&s;h."</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH he has made no exception, yet I would be liberal to him; perhaps he means to confine him&s;elf to her colonies in the We&s;t Indies. But &s;urely it will fare as ill with him there as in North America, whil&s;t we remember that in our fir&s;t

attempt at Martinico we were actually defeated; that it was three months before we reduced Gua|daloupe; and that the conque&s;t of the Havannah was atchieved by the highe&s;t conduct, aided by circum&s;tances of the greate&s;t good-fortune. He knows the expence both of men and trea&s;ure at which we bought that place. However, if it had &s;o plea&s;ed the peace-makers, it was no dear pur|cha&s;e; for it was deci&s;ive of the fortune of the war and the terms of the treaty: the duke of Nivernois thought &s;o; France, England, Europe, con&s;idered it in that light; all the world, except the then friends of the then mini&s;try, who wept for our victories, and were in ha&s;te to get rid of the burthen of our conque&s;ts. This author knows that France did not put tho&s;e colonies into the hands of England; but he well knows who did put the mo&s;t valuable of them into the hands of France.</P>
<P>IN the next place,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P. 9.</NOTE> our author is plea&s;ed to con&s;i|der the conque&s;t of tho&s;e colonies in no other light than as a convenience for the remittances to France, which he a&s;&s;erts that the war had before &s;u&s;pended, but for which a way was opened (by our conque&s;t) as &s;ecure as in time of peace. I charitably hope he knows nothing of the &s;ubject. I referred him lately to our commanders for the re&s;i&s;tance of the French colonies; I now wi&s;h he would apply to our cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries, and our merchants, for the advantages which we derived from them.</P>

fond of this &s;pecies of inquiry. I &s;ay therefore I choo&s;e the import article, as the be&s;t, and indeed the only &s;tandard we can have, of the value of the We&s;t India trade. Our export entry does not comprehend the greate&s;t trade we carry on with any of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, the &s;ale of negroes: nor does it give any idea of two other advantages we draw from them; the remittances for money &s;pent here, and the payment of part of the balance of the North Ame|rican trade. It is therefore quite ridiculous, to &s;trike a balance merely on the face of an exce&s;s of imports and exports, in that commerce; though, in mo&s;t fo|reign branches, it is, on the whole, the be&s;t method. If &s;he &s;hould take that &s;tandard, it would appear, that the balance with our own i&s;lands is, annually, &s;everal hundred thou&s;and pounds again&s;t this coun|try<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P><TABLE>

Such is its a&s;pect on the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e en|tries; but we know the direct contrary to be the fact. We know that the We&s;t Indians are always indebted to our merchants, and that the value of every &s;hilling of We&s;t India produce is Engli&s;h pro|perty. So that our import from them, and not our export, ought always to be con&s;idered as their true value; and this corrective ought to be applied to all general balances of our trade, which are formed on the ordinary principles.</P>
<P>IF po&s;&s;ible, this was more emphatically true of the French We&s;t India i&s;lands, whil&s;t they continued in our hands. That none, or only a very contemptible

part, of the value of this produce, could be remitted to France, the author will &s;ee, perhaps with unwill|ingne&s;s, but with the cleare&s;t conviction, if he con|&s;iders, that in the year 1763, <HI>after we had cea&s;ed to export</HI> to the i&s;les of Guadaloupe and Martinico, and to the Havannah, and after the colonies were free to &s;end all their produce to Old France and Spain, if they had any remittance to make; he will &s;ee, that we imported from tho&s;e places, in that year, to the amount of &pound;. 1.395.300. So far was the whole an|nual produce of the&s;e i&s;lands from being adequate to the payments of their annual call upon us, that this mighty additional importation was nece&s;&s;ary, though not quite &s;ufficient, to di&s;charge the debts contracted in the few years we held them. The property, therefore, of their whole produce, was ours; not only during the war, but even for more than a year after the peace. The author, I hope, will not again venture upon &s;o ra&s;h and di&s;couraging a propo&s;ition, concerning the nature and effect of tho&s;e conque&s;ts, as to call them a convenience to the remittances of France; he &s;ees by this account, that what he a&s;&s;erts is not only without foundation, but even impo&s;&s;ible to be true.</P>
<P>AS to our trade at that time, he labours with all his might to repre&s;ent it as ab&s;olutely ruined, or on the very edge of ruin. Indeed, as u&s;ual with him, he is often as equivocal in his expre&s;&s;ion, as he is clear in his de&s;ign. Sometimes he more than in&s;inuates a decay of our commerce in that war; &s;ometimes he admits an encrea&s;e of exports; but it is in order to depreciate the advantages we might appear to derive from that encrea&s;e, whenever it &s;hould come to be proved again&s;t him. He tells you,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P. 6.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it was chiefly occa&s;ioned by the de|mands of our own fleets and armies, and, in|&s;tead of bringing wealth to the nation, were to

Never was any thing more de&s;|titute of foundation.

Here is the &s;tate of our trade in 1761, compared with a very good year of profound peace: both are taken from the authentic en|tries at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. How the author can contrive to make this encrea&s;e of the export of Engli&s;h produce agree with his ac|count of the dreadful want of hands in England, p. 9, unle&s;s he &s;uppo&s;es manufactures to be made without hands, I really do not &s;ee. It is painful to be &s;o frequently obliged to &s;et this au|thor right in matters of fact. This &s;tate will fully refute all that he has &s;aid or in&s;inuated upon the difficulties and decay of our trade, p. 6, 7, and 9.</P></NOTE>; and he will form on that account &s;ome judgment of the author's candour or information.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="23">ADMIT however that a great part of our ex|port, though nothing is more remote from fact, was owing to the &s;upply of our fleets and armies; was it not &s;omething?&mdash;was it not peculiarly for|tunate for a nation, that &s;he was able from her own bo&s;om to contribute largely to the &s;upply of her armies militating in &s;o many di&s;tant countries? The author allows that France did not enjoy the &s;ame advantages. But it is remarkable through|out his whole book, that tho&s;e circum&s;tances which have ever been con&s;idered as great benefits, and deci&s;ive proofs of national &s;uperiority, are, when in our hands, taken either in diminution of &s;ome other apparent advantage, or even &s;ometimes as po|&s;itive misfortunes. The optics of that politician mu&s;t be of a &s;trange conformation, who beholds every thing in this di&s;torted &s;hape.</P>
<P>SO far as to our trade. With regard to our na|vigation, he is &s;till more unea&s;y at our &s;ituation, and &s;till more fallacious in his &s;tate of it. In his text, he affirms it
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to have been <HI>entirely</HI> engro&s;&s;|ed by the neutral nations."<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">P. 7. See al&s;o p. 13.</NOTE></Q> This he a&s;&s;erts roundly and boldly, and without the lea&s;t concern; although it co&s;t no more than a &s;ingle glance of the eye upon his own margin to &s;ee the full refu|tation of this a&s;&s;ertion. His own account proves again&s;t him, that in the year 1761 the Briti&s;h &s;hip|ping amounted to 527.557 tons&mdash;the foreign to no more than 180.102. The medium of his &s;ix years Briti&s;h, 2.449.555 tons&mdash;foreign only, 905.690.
<PB N="19" REF="24">
This &s;tate (his own) demon&s;trates that the neutral nations did not <HI>entirely engro&s;s our navigation.</HI></P>
<P>I AM willing from a &s;train of candour to admit that this author &s;peaks at random; that he is only &s;lovenly and inaccurate, and not fallacious. In mat|ters of account, however, this want of care is not excu&s;able: and the difference between neutral na|tions entirely engro&s;&s;ing our navigation, and being only &s;ub&s;idiary to a va&s;tly augmented trade, makes a mo&s;t material difference to his argument. From that principle of fairne&s;s, though the author &s;peaks otherwi&s;e, I am willing to &s;uppo&s;e he means no more than that our navigation had &s;o declined as to alarm us with the probable lo&s;s of this valuable object. I &s;hall however &s;hew, that his whole propo&s;ition, what|ever modifications he may plea&s;e to give it, is with|out foundation; that our navigation was not de|crea&s;ed; that, on the contrary, it was greatly en|crea&s;ed in the war; that it was encrea&s;ed by the war; and that it was probable the &s;ame cau&s;e would continue to augment it to a &s;till greater height; to what an height it is hard to &s;ay, had our &s;ucce&s;s con|tinued.</P>
<P>BUT fir&s;t I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, I am much le&s;s &s;olicit|ous whether his fact be true or no, than whether his principle is well e&s;tabli&s;hed. Ca&s;es are dead things, principles are living and productive. I then affirm that, if in time of war our trade had the good fortune to encrea&s;e, and at the &s;ame time a large, nay the large&s;t, proportion of carriage had been en|gro&s;&s;ed by neutral nations, it ought not in it&s;elf to have been con&s;idered as a circum&s;tance of di&s;tre&s;s. War is a time of inconvenience to trade; in gene|ral it mu&s;t be &s;traitened, and mu&s;t find its way as it can. It is often happy for nations that they are able to call in neutral navigation. They all aim at it. France endeavoured at it, but could not com|pa&s;s
<PB N="20" REF="25">
it. Will this author &s;ay, that, in a war with Spain, &s;uch an a&s;&s;i&s;tance would not be of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity? that it would not be the mo&s;t gro&s;s of all follies to refu&s;e it?</P>
<P>IN the next place, his method of &s;tating a medi|um of &s;ix years of war, and &s;ix years of peace, to decide this que&s;tion, is altogether unfair. To &s;ay, in derogation of the advantages of a war, that na|vigation is not equal to what it was in time of peace, is what hitherto has never been heard of. No war ever bore that te&s;t but the war which he &s;o bitterly laments. One may lay it down as a maxim, that an average e&s;timate of an object in a &s;teady cour&s;e of ri&s;ing or of falling, mu&s;t in its nature be an unfair one; more particularly if the cau&s;e of the ri&s;e or fall be vi&s;ible, and its conti|nuance in any degree probable. Average e&s;timates are never ju&s;t but when the object fluctuates, and no rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned why it &s;hould not con|tinue &s;till to fluctuate. The author chu&s;es to al|low nothing at all for this: he has taken an ave|rage of &s;ix years of the war. He knew, for every body knows, that the fir&s;t three years were on the whole rather un&s;ucce&s;sful; and that, in con&s;e|quence of this ill &s;ucce&s;s, trade &s;unk, and naviga|tion declined with it; but <HI>that grand delu&s;ion</HI> of the three la&s;t years turned the &s;cale in our favour. At the beginning of that war (as in the commence|ment of every war), traders were &s;truck with a &s;ort of panic. Many went out of the freighting bu|&s;ine&s;s. But by degrees, as the war continued, the terror wore off; the danger came to be better ap|preciated, and better provided again&s;t; our trade was carried on in large fleets, under regular con|voys, and with great &s;afety. The freighting bu|&s;ine&s;s revived. The &s;hips were fewer, but much larger; and though the number decrea&s;ed, the ton|nage was va&s;tly augmented; in &s;o much that in 1761
<PB N="21" REF="26">
the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> &s;hipping had ri&s;en by the author's own account 527.557 tons.&mdash;In the la&s;t year he has giv|en us of the peace it amountd to no more than 494.772; that is, in the la&s;t year of the war it was 32.785 tons more than in the corre&s;pondent year of his peace average. No year of the peace exceeded it except one, and that but little.</P>
<P>THE fair account of the matter is this. Our trade had, as we have ju&s;t &s;een, encrea&s;ed to &s;o a&s;|toni&s;hing a degree in 1761, as to employ Briti&s;h and foreign &s;hips to the amount of 707.659 tons, which is 149.500 more than we employed in the la&s;t year of the peace.&mdash;Thus our trade encrea&s;ed more than a fifth; our Briti&s;h navigation had en|crea&s;ed likewi&s;e with this a&s;toni&s;hing encrea&s;e of trade, but was not able to keep pace with it; and we added about 120.000 ton of foreign &s;hipping to the 60.000, which had been employed in the la&s;t year of the peace. Whatever happened to our &s;hip|ping in the former years of the war, this would be no true &s;tate of the ca&s;e at the time of the treaty. If we had lo&s;t &s;omething in the beginning, we had then recovered, and more than recovered, all our lo&s;&s;es. Such is the ground of the doleful complaints of the author, that <HI>the carrying trade was wholly en|gro&s;&s;ed by the neutral nations.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE done fairly, and even very moderately, in taking this year, and not his average, as the &s;tandard of what might be expected in future, had the war continued. The author will be compelled to allow it, unle&s;s he undertakes to &s;hew; fir&s;t, that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Canada, Martinico, Guada|loupe, Granada, the Havannah, the Philippines, the whole African trade, the whole Ea&s;t India trade, and the whole Newfoundland fi&s;hery, had no cer|tain inevitable tendency to encrea&s;e the Briti&s;h &s;hipping; unle&s;s, in the &s;econd place, he can prove
<PB N="22" REF="27">
that tho&s;e trades were, or might, by law or indul|gence, be carried on in foreign ve&s;&s;els; and un|le&s;s, thirdly, he can demon&s;trate that the premi|um of in&s;urance on Briti&s;h &s;hips was ri&s;ing as the war continued. He can prove not one of the&s;e points. I will &s;hew him a fact more, that is mor|tal to his a&s;&s;ertions. It is the &s;tate of our &s;hip|ping in 1762. The author had his rea&s;ons for &s;topping &s;hort at the preceding year. It would have appeared, had he proceeded farther, that our tonnage was in a cour&s;e of uniform augmentati|on, owing to the freight derived from our foreign conque&s;ts, and to the perfect &s;ecurity of our na|vigation from our clear and decided &s;uperiority at &s;ea. This, I &s;ay, would have appeared from the &s;tate of the two years:

The two la&s;t years of the peace were in no de|gree equal to the&s;e. Much of the navigation of 1763 was al&s;o owing to the war; this is mani|fe&s;t from the large part of it employed in the car|riage from the ceded i&s;lands, with which the com|munication &s;till continued open. No &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances of glory and advantage ever attended upon a war. Too happy will be our lot, if we &s;hould again be forced into a war, to behold any thing that &s;hall re&s;emble them; and if we were not then the better for them, it is not in the or|dinary cour&s;e of God's providence to mend our condition.</P>

long note &s;welled with calculations on that &s;ubject (even &s;uppo&s;ing the mo&s;t inaccurate of all calcula|tions to be ju&s;t) would be entirely thrown away, did it not &s;erve to rai&s;e a wonderful opinion of his financial &s;kill in tho&s;e who are not le&s;s &s;urprized than edified, when, with a &s;olemn face and my&s;teri|ous air, they are told that two and two make four. For what el&s;e do we learn from this note? that the more expence is incurred by a nation, the more money will be required to defray it; that, in proportion to the continuance of that expence, will be the continuance of borrowing; that the encrea&s;e of borrowing and the encrea&s;e of debt will go hand in hand; and la&s;tly, that the more money you want, the harder it will be to get it; and that the &s;carcity of the commodity will en|hance the price. Who ever doubted the truth, or the in&s;ignificance, of the&s;e propo&s;itions? what do they prove? that war is expen&s;ive, and peace de&s;irable. They contain nothing more than a com|mon-place again&s;t war; the ea&s;ie&s;t of all topics. To bring them home to his purpo&s;e, he ought to have &s;hewn, that our enemies had money upon better terms; which he has not &s;hewn, neither can he. I &s;hall &s;peak more fully to this point in another place. He ought to have &s;hewn, that the money they rai&s;ed, upon whatever terms, had procured them a more lucrative return. He knows that our expenditure purcha&s;ed commerce and con|que&s;t; theirs acquired nothing but defeat and bank|ruptcy.</P>
<P>THUS the author has laid down his ideas on the &s;ubject of war. Next follow tho&s;e he entertains on that of peace. The treaty of Paris upon the whole has his approbation. Indeed, if his account of the war be ju&s;t, he might have &s;pared him&s;elf all further trouble. The re&s;t is drawn on as an

inevitable conclu&s;ion.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">P. 12, 13.</NOTE> If the hou&s;e of Bourbon had the advantage, &s;he mu&s;t give the law; and the peace, though it were much wor&s;e than it is, had &s;till been a good one. But, as the world is yet <HI>deluded</HI> on the &s;tate of that war, other arguments are nece&s;&s;ary; and the author has in my opinion very ill &s;upplied them. He tells of many things we have got, and of which he has made out a kind of bill. This matter may be brought within a very narrow compa&s;s, if we come to con&s;ider the requi&s;ites of a good peace under &s;ome plain di&s;|tinct heads. I apprehend they may be reduced to the&s;e: 1. &s;tability; 2. indemnification; 3. alliance.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, the author more than ob&s;curely hints in &s;everal places, that he thinks the peace not likely to la&s;t. However, he does furni&s;h a &s;e|curity; a &s;ecurity, in any light, I fear, but in|&s;ufficient; on his hypothe&s;is,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">P. 17.</NOTE> &s;urely a very odd one.

We have, according to him, nothing to do, but to go and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, whenever we think proper, of the French and Spani&s;h &s;ettle|ments. It were better that he had examined a little what advantage the peace gave us towards the inva&s;ion of the&s;e colonies, which we did not po&s;&s;e&s;s before the peace.

at it; and therefore, according to rea&s;on, the giving up the mo&s;t valuable of all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in hopes to conquer them back, under any advan|tage of &s;ituation, is the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;ecurity that ever was imagined for the peace of a nation. It is true, his friends did not give up Canada; they could not give up every thing; let us make the mo&s;t of it. We have Canada, we know its value. We have not the French any longer to fight in North America; and, from this circum|&s;tance, we derive con&s;iderable advantages. But here let me re&s;t a little. The author touches upon a &s;tring, which &s;ounds under his fingers but a tre|mulous and melancholy note. North America was once indeed a great &s;trength to this nation, in opportunity of ports, in &s;hips, in provi&s;ions, in men. We found her a &s;ound, an active, a vigorous member of the empire. I hope, by wi&s;e management, &s;he will again become &s;o. But one of our capital pre&s;ent misfortunes is, her di&s;content and di&s;obedience. To which of the author's fa|vourites this di&s;content is owing, we all know but too &s;ufficiently. It would be a di&s;mal event, if this foundation of his &s;ecurity, and indeed of all our public &s;trength, &s;hould, in reality, become our weakne&s;s; and if all the powers of this empire, which ought to fall with a compacted weight upon the head of our enemies, &s;hould be di&s;&s;ipated and di&s;tracted by a jealous vigilance, or by ho&s;tile at|tempts upon one another. Ten Canadas cannot re&s;tore that &s;ecurity for the peace, and for every thing valuable to this country, which we have lo&s;t along with the affection and the obedience of our colonies. He is the wi&s;e mini&s;ter, he is the true friend to Britain, who &s;hall be able to re&s;tore it.</P>
<P>TO return to the &s;ecurity for the peace. The author tells us, that the original great purpo&s;es
<PB N="27" REF="32">
of the war were more than accompli&s;hed by the treaty. Surely he has experience and reading enough to know that, in the cour&s;e of a war, events may happen, that render its original very far from being its principal purpo&s;e. This original may dwindle by circum&s;tances, &s;o as to become not a purpo&s;e of the &s;econd or even the third magnitude. I tru&s;t this is &s;o obvious, that it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to put ca&s;es for its illu&s;tration. In that war, as &s;oon as Spain entered into the quarrel, the &s;ecurity of North America was no longer the &s;ole nor the foremo&s;t object. The <HI>family compact</HI> had been I know not how long before in agitation. But then it was that we &s;aw produced into day|light and action the mo&s;t odious and mo&s;t formi|dable of all the con&s;piracies again&s;t the liberties of Europe, that ever has been framed. The war with Spain was the fir&s;t fruits of that league; and a &s;e|curity again&s;t that league ought to have been the fundamental point of a pacification with the powers who compo&s;e it. We had materials in our hands to have con&s;tructed that &s;ecurity in &s;uch a manner as never to be &s;haken. But how did the virtuous and able men of our author labour for this great end? they took no one &s;tep towards it. On the contrary they countenanced, and indeed, as far as it depended on them, recognized it in all its parts; for our plenipotentiary treated with tho&s;e who acted for the two crowns, as if they had been different mini&s;ters of the &s;ame monarch. The Spani&s;h mi|ni&s;ter received his in&s;tructions, not from Madrid; but from Ver&s;ailles.</P>
<P>THIS was not hid from our mini&s;ters at home, and the di&s;covery ought to have alarmed them, if the good of their country had been the object of their anxiety. They could not but have &s;een that the whole Spani&s;h monarchy was melted down into
<PB N="28" REF="33">
the cabinet of Ver&s;ailles. But they thought this circum&s;tance an advantage; as it enabled them to go through with their work the more expeditiou&s;ly. Expedition was every thing to them; becau&s;e France might happen during a protracted nego|tiation to di&s;cover the great impo&s;ition of our vic|tories.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame &s;pirit they negotiated the terms of the peace. If it were thought advi&s;able not to take any po&s;itive &s;ecurity from Spain, the mo&s;t obvious principles of policy dictated that the burthen of the ce&s;&s;ions ought to fall upon France; and that every thing which was of grace and favour &s;hould be given to Spain. Spain could not, on her part, have executed a capital article in the family com|pact, which obliged her to compen&s;ate the lo&s;&s;es of France. At lea&s;t &s;he could not do it in America; for &s;he was expre&s;sly precluded by the treaty of Utrecht from ceding any territory or giving any advantage in trade to that power. What did our mini&s;ters? they took from Spain the territory of Florida, an object of no value except to &s;hew our di&s;po&s;itions to be quite equal at lea&s;t towards both powers; and they enabled France to compen&s;ate Spain by the gift of Loui&s;iana; loading us with all the har&s;hne&s;s, leaving the act of kindne&s;s with France, and opening thereby a door to the fulfill|ing of this the mo&s;t con&s;olidating article of the fa|mily compact. Accordingly that dangerous league, thus abetted and authorized by the Engli&s;h mini&s;|try without an attempt to invalidate it in any way, or in any of its parts, exi&s;ts to this hour; and has grown &s;tronger and &s;tronger, every hour of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>AS to the &s;econd component of a good peace, <HI>compen&s;ation,</HI> I have but little trouble; the author has &s;aid nothing upon that head. He has nothing
<PB N="29" REF="34">
to &s;ay. After a war of &s;uch expence, this ought to have been a capital con&s;ideration. But on what he has been &s;o prudently &s;ilent, I think it is right to &s;peak plainly. All our new acqui&s;itions toge|ther, at this time, &s;carce afford matter of revenue either at home or abroad, &s;ufficient to defray the expence of their e&s;tabli&s;hments; not one &s;hilling towards the reduction of our debt. Guadaloupe or Martinico alone would have given us material aid; much in the way of duties, much in the way of trade and navigation. A good mini&s;try would have con&s;idered how a renewal of the <HI>A&s;&s;iento</HI> might have been obtained. We had as much right to a&s;k it at the treaty of Paris as at the treaty of Utrecht. We had incomparably more in our hands to purcha&s;e it. Floods of trea&s;ure would have poured into this kingdom from &s;uch a &s;ource; and, under proper management, no &s;mall part of it would have taken a public direction, and have fructified an exhau&s;ted exchequer.</P>
<P>IF this gentleman's hero of finance, in&s;tead of flying from a treaty, which, though he now de|fends, he could not approve, and would not op|po&s;e; if he, in&s;tead of &s;hifting into an office, which removed him from the manufacture of the treaty, had, by his credit with the then great director, acquired for us the&s;e, or any of the&s;e objects, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Guadaloupe or Marti|nique, or the renewal of the <HI>A&s;&s;iento,</HI> he might have held his head high in his country; becau&s;e he would have performed real &s;ervice; ten thou|&s;and times more real &s;ervice, than all the oecono|my of which this writer is perpetually talking, or all the little tricks of finance which the ex|perte&s;t juggler of the trea&s;ury can practi&s;e, could amount to in a thou&s;and years. But the occa&s;ion is lo&s;t; the time is gone, perhaps, for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="35">AS to the third requi&s;ite, <HI>alliance,</HI> there too the author is &s;ilent. What &s;trength of that kind did they acquire? they got no one new ally; they &s;tript the enemy of not a &s;ingle old one. They di&s;gu&s;ted (how ju&s;tly, or unju&s;tly, matters not) every ally we had; and from that time to this, we &s;tand friendle&s;s in Europe. But of this naked condition of their country, I know &s;ome people are not a&s;hamed. They have their &s;y&s;tem of poli|tics; our ance&s;tors grew great by another. In this manner the&s;e virtuous men concluded the peace; and their practice is only con&s;onant to their theory.</P>
<P>MANY things more might be ob&s;erved on this curious head of our author's &s;peculations. But, taking leave of what the writer &s;ays in his &s;erious part, if he be &s;erious in any part, I &s;hall only ju&s;t point out a piece of his plea&s;antry. No man, I believe, ever denied that the time for making peace is that in which the be&s;t terms may be ob|tained. But what that time is, together with the u&s;e that has been made of it, we are to judge by &s;eeing whether terms adequate to our advantages, and to our nece&s;&s;ities, have been actually obtain|ed.&mdash;Here is the pinch of the que&s;tion, and to which the author ought to have &s;et his &s;houlders in earne&s;t. In&s;tead of doing this, he &s;lips out of the harne&s;s by a je&s;t; and &s;neeringly tells us, that, to determine this point, we mu&s;t know the &s;ecrets of the French and Spani&s;h cabinets,<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><P>Something however has tran&s;pired in the quarrels among tho&s;e concerned in that tran&s;action.

<P>HAVING thus gone through the que&s;tions of war and peace, the author proceeds to &s;tate our debt, and the intere&s;t which it carried, at the time of the treaty, with the unfairne&s;s and inaccuracy, how|ever, which di&s;tingui&s;h all his a&s;&s;ertions, and all his calculations. To detect every fallacy, and rectify every mi&s;take, would be endle&s;s. It will be enough to point out a few of them, in order to &s;hew how un&s;afe it is to place any thing like an implicit tru&s;t in &s;uch a writer.</P>
<P>THE intere&s;t of debt contracted during the war is &s;tated by the author at &pound;. 2.614.892. The par|ticulars appear in pages 14 and 15. Among them is &s;tated the unfunded debt, &pound;. 9.975.017, &s;uppo&s;|ed to carry intere&s;t on a medium at 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> which amounts to &pound;. 299.250. We are referred to the <HI>Con&s;iderations on the Trade and Finances of the Kingdom,</HI> p. 22, for the particulars of that unfund|ed debt. Turn to the work, and to the place re|ferred to by the author him&s;elf, if you have a mind to &s;ee a clear detection of a capital fallacy of this article in his account. You will there &s;ee that this unfunded debt con&s;i&s;ts of the nine following articles; the remaining &s;ub&s;idy to the duke of Brun&s;wick; the remaining <HI>dedommagement</HI> to the landgrave of He&s;&s;e; the German demands; the army and ordnance extraordinaries; the deficien|cies of grants and funds; Mr. Touchet's claim; the debts due to Nova Scotia and Barbadoes; exche|quer bills; and navy debt. The extreme fallacy of this &s;tate cannot e&s;cape any reader who will be at the pains to compare the intere&s;t money, with
<PB N="32" REF="37">
which he affirms us to have been loaded, in his <HI>State of the Nation,</HI> with the items of the principal debt to which he refers in his <HI>Con&s;iderations.</HI> The reader mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that of this long li&s;t of nine articles, only two, the exchequer bills, and part of the navy debt, carried any intere&s;t at all. The fir&s;t amounted to &pound;. 1.800.000; and this undoubt|edly carried intere&s;t. The whole navy debt indeed amounted to &pound;. 4.576.915; but of this only a <HI>part</HI> carried intere&s;t. The author of the <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> &amp;c. labours to prove this very point in p. 18; and Mr. G. has always defended him&s;elf upon the &s;ame ground, for the in&s;ufficient provi&s;ion he made for the di&s;charge of that debt. The reader may &s;ee their own authority for it.<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The navy bills are not due till &s;ix months after they have been i&s;&s;ued; &s;ix months al&s;o of the &s;eamens wages by act of parliament mu&s;t be, and in con&s;equence of the rules pre&s;cribed by that act, twelve months wages generally, and often much more, are retained; and there has been be&s;ides at all times a large arrear of pay, which, though kept in the account, could never be claimed, the per&s;ons to whom it was due having left neither a&s;&s;ignees nor repre&s;entatives. The preci&s;e amount of &s;uch &s;ums cannot be a&s;certained; but they can hardly be reckoned le&s;s than 13 or 14 hundred thou&s;and pounds. On 31&s;t Dec. 1754, when the navy debt was reduced nearly as low as it could be, it &s;till amounted to 1.296.567l. 18s. 11&frac34;d. con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of articles which could not then be di&s;charged; &s;uch articles will be larger now, in proportion to the encrea&s;e of the e&s;tabli&s;hment; and an allowance mu&s;t always be made for them in judging of the &s;tate of the navy debt, though they are not di&s;tin|gui&s;hable in the account. In providing for that which is payable, the principal object of the legi&s;lature is always to di&s;charge the bills, for they are the greate&s;t article; they bear an intere&s;t of 4 <HI>per cent.</HI>; and, when the quantity of them is large, they are a heavy incumbrance upon all money tran&s;actions."</Q></P></NOTE></P>
<P>MR. G. did in fact provide no more than &pound;. 2.150.000 for the di&s;charge of the&s;e bills in two years. It is much to be wi&s;hed that the&s;e gentle|men
<PB N="33" REF="38">
would lay their heads together, that they would con&s;ider well this matter, and agree upon &s;omething. For when the &s;canty provi&s;ion made for the unfunded debt is to be vindicated, then we are told it is a very <HI>&s;mall part</HI> of that debt which carries intere&s;t. But when the public is to be re|pre&s;ented in a mi&s;erable condition, and the con&s;e|quences of the late war to be laid before us in dreadful colours, then we are to be told that the unfunded debt is within a trifle of ten millions, and &s;o large a portion of it carries intere&s;t that we mu&s;t not compute le&s;s than 3 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>IN the year 1764, parliament voted &pound;. 650.000 towards the di&s;charge of the navy debt. This &s;um could not be applied &s;olely to the di&s;charge of bills carrying intere&s;t; becau&s;e part of the debt due on &s;eamens wages mu&s;t have been paid, and &s;ome bills carried no intere&s;t at all. Notwith&s;tanding this, we find by an account in the journals of the H. of C. in the following &s;e&s;&s;ion, that the navy debt carrying intere&s;t was on the 31&s;t of December 1764 no more than &pound;. 1.687,442. I am &s;ure there|fore that I admit too much when I admit the navy debt carrying intere&s;t, after the creation of the navy annuities in the year 1763, to have been &pound;. 2.200,000. Add the exchequer bills; and the whole unfunded debt carrying intere&s;t will be four millions in&s;tead of ten; and the annual intere&s;t paid for it at 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> will be &pound;. 160.000 in&s;tead of &pound;. 299.250. An error of no &s;mall magnitude, and which could not have been owing to inad|vertency.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;repre&s;entation of the encrea&s;e of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment is &s;till more extraordinary than that of the intere&s;t on the unfunded debt. The encrea&s;e is great undoubtedly. However, the au|thor finds no fault with it, and urges it only as a
<PB N="34" REF="39">
matter of argument to &s;upport the &s;trange chime|rical propo&s;als he is to make us in the clo&s;e of his work for the encrea&s;e of revenue. The greater he made that e&s;tabli&s;hment, the &s;tronger he ex|pected to &s;tand in argument: but, whatever he ex|pected or propo&s;ed, he &s;hould have &s;tated the mat|ter fairly. He tells us that this e&s;tabli&s;hment is near &pound;. 1.500.000 more than it was in 1752, 1753, and other years of peace. This he has done in his u&s;ual manner, by a&s;&s;ertion, without troubling him|&s;elf either with proof or probability. For he has not given us any &s;tate of the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment in the years 1753 and 1754, the time which he means to compare with the pre&s;ent. As I am obliged to force him to that preci&s;ion, from which he always flies as from his mo&s;t dangerous enemy, I have been at the trouble to &s;earch the journals in the period between the two la&s;t wars: and I find that the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, con&s;i&s;ting of the navy, the ordnance, and the &s;everal incidental expences, amounted to &pound;. 2.346.594. Now is this writer wild enough to imagine, that the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of 1764 and the &s;ub&s;equent years, made up from the &s;ame articles, is &pound;. 3.800.000, and upwards? His a&s;&s;ertion however goes to this. But I mu&s;t take the liberty of correcting him in this gro&s;s mi&s;take, and from an authority he cannot refu&s;e, from his favourite work, and &s;tanding authority, the Con&s;i|derations.

of 1764 and 1765 &s;tated at &pound;. 3.609.700. This is near two hundred thou&s;and pounds le&s;s than that given in the State of the Nation. But even from this, in order to render the articles which compo&s;e the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment in the two periods corre&s;pondent (for otherwi&s;e they cannot be com|pared), we mu&s;t deduct fir&s;t, his articles of the deficiency of land and malt, which amount to &pound;. 300.000. They certainly are no part of the e&s;tabli&s;hment; nor are they included in that &s;um, which I have &s;tated above for the e&s;tabli&s;hment in the time of the former peace. If they were proper to be &s;tated at all, they ought to be &s;tated in both accounts. We mu&s;t al&s;o deduct the deficiencies of funds, &pound;. 202.400. The&s;e deficiencies are the dif|ference between the intere&s;t charged on the public for monies borrowed, and the produce of the taxes laid for the di&s;charge of that intere&s;t. Annual pro|vi&s;ion is indeed to be made for them by parlia|ment: but in the enquiry before us, which is only what charge is brought on the public by intere&s;t paid or to be paid for money borrowed, the utmo&s;t that the author &s;hould do is to bring into the ac|count the full intere&s;t for all that money. This he has done in p. 15; and he repeats it in p. 18, the very page I am now examining, &pound;. 2.614.892. To comprehend afterwards in the peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment the deficiency of the fund created for pay|ment of that intere&s;t, would be laying twice to the account of the war part of the &s;ame &s;um. Suppo&s;e ten millions borrowed at 4 <HI>per cent.</HI> and the fund for payment of the intere&s;t to produce no more than &pound;. 200.000. The whole annual charge on the
<PB N="36" REF="41">
public is &pound;. 400.000. It can be no more. But to charge the intere&s;t in one part of the account, and then the deficiency in the other, would be charging &pound;. 600.000. The deficiency of funds mu&s;t there|fore be al&s;o deducted from the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment in the Con&s;iderations; and then the peace e&s;tabli&s;h|ment in that author will be reduced to the &s;ame articles with tho&s;e included in the &s;um I have already mentioned for the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment be|fore the la&s;t war, in the year 1753, and 1754.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>IT is true, the extraordinaries of the army have been found con&s;iderably greater than the author of the Con&s;iderations was plea&s;ed to foretell they would be. The author of the Pre&s;ent State avails him&s;elf of that encrea&s;e, and, finding it &s;uit his purpo&s;e, &s;ets the whole down in the peace-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the pre&s;ent times. If this is allow|ed him, his error perhaps may be reduced to &pound;. 700.000. But I doubt the author of the Con&s;iderations will not thank him for admitting &pound;. 200.000. and upwards, as the peace-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment for extraordinaries, when that author has &s;o much laboured to confine them within &pound;. 35.000.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the capital fallacies of the author. To break the thread of my di&s;cour&s;e as little as po&s;&s;ible, I have thrown into the margin many in&s;tances, though God knows far from the whole, of his inaccuracies, incon&s;i&s;tencies, and want of common care. I think my&s;elf obliged to take &s;ome notice of them, in order to take off from any authority this writer may have; and to put an end to the deference which carele&s;s men are apt to pay to one who boldly arrays his accounts, and mar|&s;hals
<PB N="38" REF="43">
his figures, in perfect confidence that their correctne&s;s will never be examined.<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><P>Upon the money borrowed in 1760, the premium of one <HI>per cent.</HI> was for 21 years, not for 20; this annuity has been paid eight years in&s;tead of &s;even; the &s;um paid is therefore &pound;. 640.000 in&s;tead of &pound;. 560 000; the remaining term is worth 10 years and a quarter in&s;tead of 11 years; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Smart and Demoivre.</NOTE> its value is &pound;. 820.000 in&s;tead of &pound;. 880.000; and the whole value of that premium is &pound;. 1.460.000 in&s;tead of &pound;. 1.440.000. The like errors are ob&s;ervable in his computation on the additional capital of three <HI>per cent.</HI> on the loan of that year. In like manner, on the loan of 1762, the author computes on five years payments in&s;tead of &s;ix; and &s;ays in expre&s;s terms, that take five from 19, and there remains 13. The&s;e are not errors of the pen or the pre&s;s; the &s;everal computations pur&s;ued in this part of the work with great diligence and earne&s;tne&s;s prove them errors upon much deliberation. Thus the premiums in 1759 are ca&s;t up &pound;. 90.000 too little, an error in the fir&s;t rule of arithmetic.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The annuities borrowed in 1756 and 1758 are,"
&s;ays he, "to continue till redeemed by parliament."</Q> He does not take notice that the fir&s;t are irredeemable till Fe|bruary 1771, the other till July 1782. In this the amount of the premiums is computed on the time which they have run. Weakly and ignorantly; for he might have added to this, and &s;trengthened his argument, &s;uch as it is, by charging al&s;o the value of the additional one <HI>per cent.</HI> from the day on which he wrote to at lea&s;t that day on which the&s;e annuities become re|deemable. To make ample amends, however, he has added to the premiums of 15 <HI>per cent.</HI> in 1759, and three <HI>per cent.</HI> in 1760, the annuity paid for them &s;ince their commencement; the fallacy of which is manife&s;t; for the premiums in the&s;e ca&s;es can be neither more nor le&s;s than the additional capital for which the public &s;tands engaged, and is ju&s;t the &s;ame whe|ther five or 500 years annuity has been paid for it. In private life, no man per&s;uades him&s;elf that he has borrowed &pound;. 200, becau&s;e he happens to have paid 20 years intere&s;t on loan of &pound;. 100.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>HOWEVER, for argument, I am content to take his &s;tate of it. The debt was and is enormous. The war was expen&s;ive. The be&s;t oeconomy had not perhaps been u&s;ed. But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that war and oeconomy are things not ea&s;ily reconciled; and that the attempt of leaning towards par&s;imony
<PB N="39" REF="44">
in &s;uch a &s;tate may be the wor&s;t management, and in the end the wor&s;t oeconomy in the world, hazarding the total lo&s;s of all the charge incurred, and of every thing el&s;e along with it.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>cui bono</HI> all this detail of our debt? has the author given a &s;ingle light towards any material reduction of it? Not a glimmering. We &s;hall &s;ee in its place what &s;ort of thing he propo&s;es. But before he commences his operations, in order to &s;care the public imagination, he rai&s;es by art magic a thick mi&s;t before our eyes, through which glare the mo&s;t gha&s;tly and horrible phantoms:
<Q><L>Hunc igitur terrorem animi tenebrasque nece&s;&s;e e&s;t,</L>
<L>Non radii &s;olis, neque lucida tela diei</L>
<L>Di&s;cutiant, &s;ed naturae &s;pecies ratioque.</L></Q>
Let us therefore calmly, if we can for the fright into which he has put us, appreciate tho&s;e dreadful and deformed gorgons and hydras, which inhabit the joyle&s;s regions of an imagination, fruitful in nothing but the production of mon&s;ters.</P>
<P>HIS whole repre&s;entation is founded on the &s;up|po&s;ed operation of our debt, upon our manufac|tures, and our trade. To this cau&s;e he attributes a certain &s;uppo&s;ed dearne&s;s of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, which mu&s;t compel our manufacturers to emi|grate to cheaper countries, particularly to France, and with them the manufacture. Thence con|&s;umption declining, and with it revenue. He will not permit the real balance of our trade to be e&s;ti|mated &s;o high &pound;. 2.500.000; and the intere&s;t of the debt to foreigners carries off &pound;. 1.500.000 of that balance. France is not in the &s;ame condition. Then follow his wailings and lamentings, which he renews over and over, according to his cu&s;tom&mdash;a declining trade, and decrea&s;ing &s;pecie&mdash;on the point of becoming tributary to France&mdash;of
<PB N="40" REF="45">
lo&s;ing Ireland&mdash;of having the colonies torn away from us.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing upon which I &s;hall ob&s;erve is, what he takes<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P. 30, 31, 32.</NOTE> for granted as the cleare&s;t of all propo&s;itions, the emigration of our manufacturers to France. I undertake to &s;ay that this a&s;&s;ertion is totally groundle&s;s, and I challenge the author to bring any &s;ort of proof of it. If living is cheaper in France, that is, to be had for le&s;s &s;pecie, wages are proportionably lower. No manufacturer, let the living be what it will, was ever known to fly for refuge to low wages. Money is the fir&s;t thing which attracts him. Accordingly our wages attract artificers from all parts of the world. From two &s;hillings to one &s;hilling, is a fall, in all mens ima|ginations, which no calculation upon a difference in the price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life can compen|&s;ate. But it will be hard to prove, that a French artificer is better fed, cloathed, lodged, and warm|ed, than one in England; for that is the &s;en&s;e, and the only &s;en&s;e, of living cheaper. If, in truth and fact, our artificer farcs as well in all the&s;e re&s;pects as one in the &s;ame &s;tate in France&mdash;how &s;tands the matter in point of opinion and prejudice, the &s;prings by which people in that cla&s;s of life are chiefly actuated! The idea of our common people, concerning French living, is dreadful; altogether as dreadful as our author's can po&s;&s;ibly be of the &s;tate of his own country; a way of thinking that will hardly ever prevail on them to de&s;ert to France.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">In a cour&s;e of years a few manufacturers have been tempted abroad, not by cheap living, but by immen&s;e pre|miums, to &s;et up as ma&s;ters, and to introduce the manufacture. This mu&s;t happen in every country eminent for the &s;kill of its artificers, and has nothing to do with taxes and the price of provi&s;ions.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="46">BUT, leaving the author's &s;peculations, the fact is, that they have not de&s;erted; and of cour&s;e the manufacture cannot be departed, or departing, with them. I am not indeed able to get at all the details of all our manufactures; though, I think, I have taken full as much pains for that purpo&s;e as our author. Some I have by me; and they do not hitherto, thank God, &s;upport the author's com|plaint, unle&s;s a va&s;t encrea&s;e of the quantity of goods manufactured be a proof of lo&s;ing the ma|nufacture. On a view of the regi&s;ters in the We&s;t|riding of York&s;hire, for three years before the war, and for the three la&s;t, it appears, that the quanti|ties of cloths entered were as follow:

<P>IN this manner this capital branch of manufac|ture has encrea&s;ed, under the encrea&s;e of taxes; and this not from a declining, but from a greatly flouri&s;hing period of commerce. I may &s;ay the

&s;ame on the be&s;t authority of the fabric of thin goods at Halifax; of the bays at Rochdale; and of that infinite variety of admirable manufactures that grow and extend every year among the &s;pi|rited, inventive, and enterprizing traders of Man|che&s;ter.</P>
<P>A TRADE &s;ometimes &s;eems to peri&s;h when it only a&s;&s;umes a different form. Thus the coar&s;e&s;t woollens were formerly exported in great quanti|ties to Ru&s;&s;ia. The Ru&s;&s;ians now &s;upply them&s;elves with the&s;e goods. But the export thither of finer cloths has encrea&s;ed in proportion as the other has declined. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome parts of the kingdom may have felt &s;omething like a languor in bu&s;ine&s;s. Objects like trade and manufacture, which the very attempt to confine would certainly de&s;troy, fre|quently change their place; and thereby, far from being lo&s;t, are often highly improved. Thus &s;ome manufactures have decayed in the we&s;t and &s;outh, which have made new and more vigorous &s;hoots when tran&s;planted into the north. And here it is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s by, though the author has &s;aid nothing upon it, the va&s;t addition to the ma&s;s of Briti&s;h trade, which has been made by the improve|ment of Scotland. What does he think of the commerce of the city of Gla&s;gow, and of the ma|nufactures of Pai&s;ley and all the adjacent county? has this any thing like the deadly a&s;pect and <HI>facies Hippocratica</HI> which the fal&s;e diagno&s;tic of our &s;tate phy&s;ician has given to our trade in general? has he not heard of the iron works of &s;uch magnitude even in their cradle which are &s;et up on the Carron, and which at the &s;ame time have drawn nothing from Sheffield, Birmingham, or Wolverhampton?</P>
<P>THIS might perhaps be enough to &s;hew the en|tire fal&s;ity of the complaint concerning the decline of our manufactures. But every &s;tep we advance,
<PB N="43" REF="48">
this matter clears up more and more; and the fal&s;e terrors of the author are di&s;&s;ipated, and fade away as the light appears.

Nothing more true than the general ob&s;ervation: nothing more fal&s;e than its applica|tion to our circum&s;tances. Let the revenue on con|&s;umption &s;peak for it&s;elf:

Here is no diminution. Here is, on the contrary, an immen&s;e encrea&s;e. This is owing, I &s;hall be told, to the new duties, which may encrea&s;e the total bulk, but at the &s;ame time may make &s;ome diminution of the produce of the old. Were this the fact, it would be far from &s;upporting the au|thor's complaint. It might have proved that the burthen lay rather too heavy; but it would never prove that the <HI>revenue from con&s;umption</HI> was impair|ed, which it was his bu&s;ine&s;s to do. But what is the real fact? Let us take, as the be&s;t in&s;tance for the purpo&s;e, the produce of the old hereditary and temporary exci&s;e granted in the reign of Charles the &s;econd, who&s;e object is that of mo&s;t of the new impo&s;itions, from two averages, each of eight years:

Be&s;ides the ac|qui&s;ition of &s;o much new, this article, to &s;peak of no other, has rather encrea&s;ed under the pre&s;&s;ure of all tho&s;e additional taxes to which the author is plea&s;ed to attribute its de&s;truction.

For this purpo&s;e we take the &s;tate of that &s;pecific article upon which the two capital burthens of the war leaned the mo&s;t immediately, by the additional duties on malt, and upon beer:

They did not in the lea&s;t impair the con&s;umption: it has grown under them. It appears that, upon the whole, the people did not feel &s;o much inconvenience from the new duties as to oblige them to take refuge in the private brew|ery. Quite the contrary happened in both the&s;e re&s;pects in the reign of king William; and it hap|pened from much &s;lighter impo&s;itions.<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Although the public brewery has con&s;iderably encrea&s;ed in this latter period, the produce of the malt tax has been &s;ome|thing le&s;s than in the former; this cannot be attributed to the new malt tax. Had this been the cau&s;e of the le&s;&s;ened con&s;ump|tion, the public brewery, &s;o much more burthened, mu&s;t have felt it more. The cau&s;e of this diminution of the malt tax, I take to have been principally owing to the greater dearne&s;s of corn in the &s;econd period than the fir&s;t, which, in all its con&s;e|quences, affected the people in the country much more than tho&s;e in the towns. But the revenue from con&s;umption was not on the whole impaired, as we have &s;een in the foregoing page.</NOTE> No peo|ple can long con&s;ume a commodity for which they are not well able to pay. An enlightened reader laughs at the incon&s;i&s;tent chimera of our author, of a people univer&s;ally luxurious, and at the &s;ame time oppre&s;&s;ed with taxes and declining in trade. For my part, I cannot look on the&s;e duties as the author does. He &s;ees nothing but the burthen. I can perceive the burthen as well as he; but I can|not avoid contemplating al&s;o the &s;trength that &s;up|ports it. From thence I draw the mo&s;t comfortable a&s;&s;urances of the future vigour, and the ample re|&s;ources, of this great mi&s;repre&s;ented country; and can never prevail on my&s;elf to make complaints which have no cau&s;e, in order to rai&s;e hopes which have no foundation.</P>

<P>IN the la&s;t three years the whole of our exports was between 44 and 45 millions. In the three years preceding the war, it was no more than from
<PB N="47" REF="52">
35 to 36 millions. The average balance of the former period was &pound;. 3.706.000; of the latter, &s;omething above four millions. It is true, that whil&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions of the author's de&s;tructive war continued, our trade was greater than it is at pre&s;ent. One of the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the peace was, that France mu&s;t gradually recover a part of tho&s;e markets of which &s;he had been originally in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. However, after all the&s;e deductions, &s;till the gro&s;s trade in the wor&s;t year of the pre&s;ent is better than in the be&s;t year of any former period of peace. A very great part of our taxes, if not the greate&s;t, has been impo&s;ed &s;ince the beginning of this century. On the author's principles, this continual encrea&s;e of taxes mu&s;t have ruined our trade, or at lea&s;t entirely checked its growth. But I have a manu&s;cript of Davenant, which contains an ab&s;tract of our trade for the years 1703 and 1704; by which it appears, that the whole export from England did not then exceed &pound;. 6.552.019. It is now con&s;iderably more than double that amount. Yet England was then a rich and flouri&s;hing nation.</P>
<P>THE author endeavours to derogate from the balance in our favour as it &s;tands on the entries, and reduces it from four millions as it there appears to no more than &pound;. 2.500.000. His ob&s;ervation on the loo&s;ene&s;s and inaccuracy of the export entries is ju&s;t; and that the error is always an error of exce&s;s, I readily admit. But becau&s;e, as u&s;ual, he has wholly omitted &s;ome very material facts, his conclu&s;ion is as erroneous as the entries he com|plains of.</P>
<P>ON this point of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries I &s;hall make a few ob&s;ervations. 1&s;t, The inaccuracy of the&s;e entries can extend only to FREE GOODS, that is, to &s;uch Briti&s;h products and manufactures,
<PB N="48" REF="53">
as are exported without drawback and without bounty; which do not in general amount to more than two-thirds at the very utmo&s;t of the whole ex|port even of <HI>our home products.</HI> The valuable ar|ticles of corn, malt, leather, hops, beer, and many others, do not come under this objection of inac|curacy. The article of CERTIFICATE GOODS re|exported, a va&s;t branch of our commerce, admits of no error (except &s;ome &s;maller frauds which can|not be e&s;timated), as they have all a drawback of duty, and the exporter mu&s;t therefore correctly &s;pecify their quantity and kind. The author there|fore is not warranted from the known error in &s;ome of the entries, to make a general defalcation from the whole balance in our favour. This error can|not affect more than half, if &s;o much, of the ex|port article. 2dly, In the account made up at the in&s;pector general's office, they e&s;timate only the original co&s;t of Briti&s;h products as they are here purcha&s;ed; and on foreign goods, only the prices in the country from whence they are &s;ent. This was the method e&s;tabli&s;hed by Mr. Davenant; and, as far as it goes, it certainly is a good one. But the profits of the merchant at home, and of our factories abroad, are not taken into the ac|count: which profit on &s;uch an immen&s;e quantity of goods exported and re-exported cannot fail of being very great: five <HI>per cent.</HI> upon the whole, I &s;hould think a very moderate allowance. 3dly, It does not comprehend the advantage ari&s;ing from the employment of 600.000 tons of &s;hipping, which mu&s;t be paid by the foreign con&s;umer, and which, in many bulky articles of commerce, is equal to the value of the commodity. This can &s;carcely be rated at le&s;s than a million annually. 4thly, The whole import from Ireland and Ame|rica, and from the We&s;t Indies, is &s;et again&s;t us in the ordinary way of &s;triking a balance of imports
<PB N="49" REF="54">
and exports; whereas the import and export are both our own. This is ju&s;t as ridiculous, as to put again&s;t the general balance of the nation, how much more goods Che&s;hire receives from London, than London from Che&s;hire. The whole revolves and circulates through this kingdom, and is, &s;o far as it regards our profit, in the nature of home trade, as much as if the &s;everal countries of Ame|rica and Ireland were all pieced to Cornwall. The cour&s;e of exchange with all the&s;e places is fully &s;uf|ficient to demon&s;trate that this kingdom has the whole advantage of their commerce. When the final profit upon a whole &s;y&s;tem of trade re&s;ts and centers in a certain place, a balance &s;truck in that place merely on the mutual &s;ale of commodities is quite fallacious. 5thly, The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries furni&s;h a mo&s;t defective, and indeed ridiculous idea, of the mo&s;t valuable branch of trade we have in the world, that with Newfoundland. Ob&s;erve what, you export thither; a little &s;pirits, provi&s;ion, fi&s;hing lines, and fi&s;hing hooks. Is the <HI>export</HI> the true idea of the Newfoundland trade in the light of a beneficial branch of commerce? nothing le&s;s. Examine our imports from thence; it &s;eems, upon this vulgar idea of exports and imports, to turn the balance again&s;t you. But your exports to Newfoundland are your own goods. Your import is your own food; as much your own, as that you rai&s;e with your ploughs out of your own &s;oil; and not your lo&s;s, but your gain; your riches, not your poverty. But &s;o fallacious is this way of judging, that neither the export nor import, nor both together, &s;upply any idea approaching to adequate of that branch of bu&s;ine&s;s. The ve&s;&s;els in that trade go &s;trait from Newfoundland to the foreign market; and the &s;ale there, not the import here, is the mea&s;ure of its value. That trade which is one of your greate&s;t and be&s;t is hardly &s;o
<PB N="50" REF="55">
much as &s;een in the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries; and it is not of le&s;s annual value to this nation than <HI>&pound;.</HI> 400.000. 6thly, The quality of your imports mu&s;t be con&s;idered as well as the quantity. To &s;tate the whole of the foreign import <HI>as lo&s;s,</HI> is ex|ceedingly ab&s;urd. All the iron, hemp, flax, cot|ton, Spani&s;h wool, raw &s;ilk, woollen and linen yarn, which we import, are by no means to be con&s;ider|ed as the matter of a merely luxurious con&s;ump|tion; which is the idea too generally and loo&s;ely annexed to our import article. The&s;e above-men|tioned are materials of indu&s;try, not of luxury, which are wrought up here, in many in&s;tances, to ten times, and more, of their original value. Even where they are not &s;ub&s;ervient to our exports, they &s;till add to our internal wealth, which con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tock of u&s;eful commodities, as much as in gold and &s;ilver. In looking over the &s;pecific articles of our export and import, I have often been a&s;toni&s;h|ed to &s;ee for how &s;mall a part of the &s;upply of our con&s;umption, either luxurious or convenient, we are indebted to nations properly foreign to us.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations are entirely pa&s;&s;ed over by the author; they have been but too much neglected by mo&s;t who have &s;peculated on this &s;ubject. But they ought never to be omitted by tho&s;e who mean to come to any thing like the true &s;tate of the Briti&s;h trade. They compen&s;ate, and they more than compen&s;ate, every thing which the author can cut off with any appearance of rea&s;on for the over-entry of Briti&s;h goods; and they re|&s;tore to us that balance of four millions, which the author has thought proper on &s;uch a very poor and limited comprehen&s;ion of the object to reduce to <HI>&pound;.</HI> 2.500.000.</P>
<P>IN general this author is &s;o circum&s;tanced, that to &s;upport his theory he is obliged to a&s;&s;ume his
<PB N="51" REF="56">
facts; and then, if you allow his facts, they will not &s;upport his conclu&s;ions. What if all he &s;ays of the &s;tate of this balance were true? did not the &s;ame objections always lie to cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries? do they defalcate more from the entries of 1766 than from tho&s;e of 1754? If they prove us ruined, we were always ruined. Some ravens have always indeed croaked out this kind of &s;ong. They have a malignant delight in pre&s;aging mi&s;chief, when they are not employed in doing it: they are mi|&s;erable and di&s;appointed at every in&s;tance of the public pro&s;perity. They overlook us like the male|volent being of the poet:
<Q><L>Tritonida con&s;picit arcem</L>
<L>Ingeniis, opibu&s;que, et fe&s;ta pace virentem;</L>
<L>Vixque tenet lacrymas quia nil lacrymabile cernit.</L></Q></P>
<P>IT is in this &s;pirit that &s;ome have looked upon tho&s;e accidents that ca&s;t an occa&s;ional damp upon trade. Their imaginations entail the&s;e accidents upon us in perpetuity. We have had &s;ome bad harve&s;ts. This mu&s;t very di&s;advantageou&s;ly affect the balance of trade, and the navigation of a peo|ple, &s;o large a part of who&s;e commerce is in grain. But, in knowing the cau&s;e, we are morally certain, that, according to the cour&s;e of events, it cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. In the three la&s;t years, we have ex|ported &s;carcely any grain; in good years, that ex|port hath been worth twelve hundred thou&s;and pounds and more; in the two la&s;t years, far from exporting, we have been obliged to import to the amount perhaps of our former exportation. So that in this article the balance mu&s;t be <HI>&pound;.</HI> 2.000.000 again&s;t us; that is, one million in the cea&s;ing of gain, the other in the encrea&s;e of expenditure. But none of the author's promi&s;es or projects could have prevented this misfortune; and, thank God, we do not want him or them to relieve us from it;
<PB N="52" REF="57">
although, if his friends &s;hould now come into power, I doubt not but they will be ready to take credit for any encrea&s;e of trade or exci&s;e, that may ari&s;e from the happy circum&s;tance of a good harve&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS connects with his loud laments and me|lancholy progno&s;tications concerning the high price of the nece&s;&s;aries of life and the products of labour. With all his others, I deny this fact; and I again call upon him to prove it. Take average and not accident, the grand and fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary of life is cheap in this country; and that too as weighed, not again&s;t labour, which is its true counterpoi&s;e, but again&s;t money. Does he call the price of wheat at this day, between 32 and 40 &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> quarter in London, dear?<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">It is dearer in &s;ome places, and rather cheaper in others; but it mu&s;t &s;oon all come to a level.</NOTE> He mu&s;t know that fuel (an object of the highe&s;t order in the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity in almo&s;t every kind of manufacture) is in many of our provinces cheaper than in any part of the globe. Meat is on the whole not exce&s;&s;ively dear, whatever its price may be at particular times and from particular accidents. If it has had any thing like an uniform ri&s;e, this enhancement may ea&s;ily be proved not to be owing to the encrea&s;e of taxes, but to uniform encrea&s;e of con&s;umption and of money. Dimini&s;h the latter, and meat in your markets will be &s;ufficiently cheap in account, but much dearer in effect: becau&s;e fewer will be in a condition to buy. Thus your apparent plenty will be real indigence. At pre&s;ent, even under temporary di&s;advantages, the u&s;e of fle&s;h is greater here than any where el&s;e; it is continued without any interruption of Lents or meagre days; it is &s;u&s;tained and growing even with the encrea&s;e of our taxes. But &s;ome have the art of converting
<PB N="53" REF="58">
even the &s;igns of national pro&s;perity into &s;ymptoms of decay and ruin. And our author, who &s;o loudly di&s;claims popularity, never fails to lay hold of the mo&s;t vulgar popular prejudices and humours, in hopes to captivate the croud. Even tho&s;e peevi&s;h di&s;po&s;itions which grow out of &s;ome tran&s;itory &s;uf|fering, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ing clouds which float in our changeable atmo&s;phere; are by him indu&s;triou&s;ly figured into frightful &s;hapes, in order fir&s;t to terrify and then to govern the populace.</P>
<P>IT was not enough for the author's purpo&s;e to give this fal&s;e and di&s;couraging picture of the &s;tate of his own country. It did not fully an&s;wer his end, to exaggerate her burthens, to depreciate her &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and to vilify her character. Nothing had been done, unle&s;s the &s;ituation of France were ex|alted in proportion as that of England had been aba&s;ed. The reader will excu&s;e the citation I make at length from his book; he out-does him&s;elf upon this occa&s;ion. His confidence is indeed unparalleled, and altogether of the heroic ca&s;t:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"IF our rival nations were in the &s;ame circum|&s;tances with our&s;elves, the <HI>augmentation of our taxes would produce no ill con&s;equences:</HI> if we were obliged to rai&s;e our prices, they mu&s;t, from the &s;ame cau&s;es, do the like, and could take no ad|vantage by under-&s;elling and under-working us. But the alarming con&s;ideration to Great Britain is, <HI>that France is not in the &s;ame condition.</HI> Her di&s;tre&s;&s;es, during the war, were great, but they were immediate; her want of credit, as has been &s;aid, compelled her to impoveri&s;h her people, by rai&s;ing the greate&s;t part of her &s;up|plies within the year; <HI>but the burdens &s;he impo&s;ed on them were, in a great mea&s;ure, temporary, and mu&s;t be greatly dimini&s;hed by a few years of peace.</HI> She could procure no con&s;iderable loans, there|fore
<PB N="54" REF="59">
&s;he has mortgaged no <HI>&s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive taxes as tho&s;e Great Britain has impo&s;ed in perpetuity for payment of intere&s;t.</HI> Peace mu&s;t, therefore, &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;h her commerce and manufactures, e&s;pecially as the comparative <HI>lightne&s;s of taxes,</HI> and the cheapne&s;s of living, in that country, mu&s;t make France an a&s;ylum for Briti&s;h manu|facturers and artificers."</Q>
On this the author re&s;ts the merits of his whole &s;y&s;tem. And on this point I will join i&s;&s;ue with him. If France is not at lea&s;t in the <HI>&s;ame condition,</HI> even in that very condition which the author fal&s;ely repre&s;ents to be ours, if the very rever&s;e of his propo&s;ition be not true, then I will admit his State of the Nation to be ju&s;t; and all his inferences from that &s;tate to be logical and conclu&s;ive. It is not &s;urprizing, that the author &s;hould hazard our opinion of his veracity. That is a virtue on which great &s;tate&s;men do not perhaps pique them&s;elves &s;o much: but it is &s;omewhat ex|traordinary, that he &s;hould &s;take on a very poor calculation of chances, all credit for care, for ac|curacy, and for knowledge of the &s;ubject of which he treats. He is ra&s;h and inaccurate, becau&s;e he thinks he writes to a public ignorant and inatten|tive. But he may find him&s;elf in that re&s;pect, as in many others, greatly mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>IN order to contra&s;t the light and vigorous con|dition of France with that of England, weak, and &s;inking under her burthens, he &s;tates in his 10th page, that France had rai&s;ed &pound;. 50.314.378 &s;terling <HI>by taxes within the &s;everal years</HI> from the year 1756 to 1762 both inclu&s;ive. An Engli&s;hman mu&s;t &s;tand agha&s;t at &s;uch a repre&s;entation: to find France able to <HI>rai&s;e within the year</HI> &s;ums little inferior to all that we were able even to <HI>borrow</HI> on intere&s;t with all the re&s;ources of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed credit in the world! Europe was filled with a&s;toni&s;h|ment
<PB N="55" REF="60">
when they &s;aw England <HI>borrow</HI> in one year twelve millions. It was thought, and very ju&s;tly, no &s;mall proof of national &s;trength and financial &s;kill, to find a fund for the payment of the intere&s;t upon this &s;um. The intere&s;t of this, computed with the one <HI>per cent.</HI> annuities, amounted only to &pound;. 600.000 a year. This, I &s;ay, was thought a &s;urpri&s;ing effort even of credit. But this author talks, as of a thing not worth proving, and but ju&s;t worth ob&s;erving, that France in one year rai&s;ed &s;ixteen times that &s;um without borrowing, and continued to rai&s;e &s;ums not far from equal to it for &s;everal years together. Suppo&s;e &s;ome Jacob Hen|riques had propo&s;ed, in the year 1762, to pre|vent a perpetual charge on the nation by rai&s;ing ten millions within the year. He would have been con&s;idered, not as a har&s;h financier, who laid an heavy hand on the public; but as a poor vi&s;ionary, who had run mad on &s;upplies and taxes. They who know that the whole land tax of England, at 4s. in the pound, rai&s;es but two millions; will not ea&s;ily apprehend that any &s;uch &s;ums as the author has conjured up can be rai&s;ed even in the mo&s;t opu|lent nations. France owed a large debt, and was incumbered with heavy e&s;tabli&s;hments, before that war. The author does not formally deny that &s;he borrowed &s;omething in every year of its continu|ance; let him produce the funds for this a&s;toni&s;hing annual addition to all her va&s;t preceding taxes, an addition equal to the whole exci&s;e, cu&s;toms, land and malt taxes of England taken together.</P>
<P>BUT what mu&s;t be the reader's a&s;toni&s;hment, perhaps his indignation, if he &s;hould find that this great financier has fallen into the mo&s;t unaccount|able of all errors, no le&s;s an error than that of mi&s;taking the <HI>identical &s;ums borrowed by France upon intere&s;t, for &s;upplies rai&s;ed within the year.</HI> Can it
<PB N="56" REF="61">
be conceived that any man only entered into the fir&s;t rudiments of finance &s;hould make &s;o egregious a blunder; &s;hould write it, &s;hould print it; &s;hould carry it to a &s;econd edition; &s;hould take it not col|laterally and incidentally, but lay it down as the corner &s;tone of his whole &s;y&s;tem, in &s;uch an impor|tant point as the comparative &s;tates of France and England? But it will be &s;aid, that it was his misfor|tune to be ill informed. Not at all. A man of any loo&s;e general knowledge, and of the mo&s;t ordinary &s;agacity, never could have been mi&s;informed in &s;o gro&s;s a manner; becau&s;e he would have immediately rejected &s;o wild and extravagant an account.</P>
<P>THE fact is this: the credit of France, bad as it might have been, did enable her (not to rai&s;e within the year) but to <HI>borrow</HI> the very &s;ums the author mentions; that is to &s;ay, 1.106.916.261 livres, making, in the author's computation, <HI>&pound;.</HI> 50.314.378. The credit of France was low; but it was not annihilated. She did not derive, as our author choo&s;es to a&s;&s;ert, any advantages from the debility of her credit. Its con&s;equence was the natural one: &s;he borrowed; but &s;he borrowed upon bad terms, indeed on the mo&s;t exorbitant u&s;ury.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking of a foreign revenue, the very pre|tence to accuracy would be the mo&s;t inaccurate thing in the world. Neither the author nor I can with certainty authenticate the information we com|municate to the public, nor in an affair of eternal fluctuation arrive at perfect exactne&s;s. All we can do, and this we may be expected to do, is to avoid gro&s;s errors and blunders of a capital nature. We cannot order the proper officer to lay the accounts before the hou&s;e. But the reader mu&s;t judge on the probability of the accounts we lay before him. The author &s;peaks of France as rai&s;ing her &s;upplies
<PB N="57" REF="62">
for war by taxes within the year; and of her debt, as a thing &s;carcely worthy of notice. I affirm that &s;he borrowed large &s;ums in every year; and has thereby accumulated an immen&s;e debt. This debt continued after the war infinitely to embarra&s;s her affairs; and to find &s;ome means for its reduction was then and has ever &s;ince been the fir&s;t object of her policy. But &s;he has &s;o little &s;ucceeded in all her efforts, that the <HI>perpetual</HI> debt of France is at this hour little &s;hort of <HI>&pound;.</HI> 100.000.000 &s;terling; and &s;he &s;tands charged with at lea&s;t 40.000.000 of Engli&s;h pounds on life-rents and tontines. The annuities paid at this day at the hotel de Ville of Paris, which are by no means her &s;ole payments of that nature, amount to 139.000.000 of livres, that is, to 6.318.000 pounds; be&s;ides <HI>billets au porteur,</HI> and various detached and unfunded debts, to a great amount, and which bear an intere&s;t.</P>
<P>AT the end of the war, the intere&s;t payable on her debt amounted to upwards of &s;even millions &s;terling. M. de la Verdy, the la&s;t hope of the French finances, was called in, to aid in the re|duction of an intere&s;t, &s;o light to our author, &s;o intolerably heavy upon tho&s;e who are to pay it. After many un&s;ucce&s;sful efforts towards reconciling arbitrary reduction with public credit, he was ob|liged to go the plain high road of power, and to impo&s;e a tax of 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> upon a very great part of the capital debt of that kingdom; and this mea|&s;ure of pre&s;ent ea&s;e, to the de&s;truction of future credit, produced about &pound;. 500.000 a year, which was carried to their <HI>cai&s;&s;e d'amorti&s;&s;ement</HI> or &s;inking fund. But &s;o unfaithfully and un&s;teadily has this and all the other articles which compo&s;e that fund been applied to their purpo&s;es, that they have given the &s;tate but very little even of pre&s;ent relief, &s;ince it is known to the whole world that &s;he is behind-hand
<PB N="58" REF="63">
on every one of her e&s;tabli&s;hments. Since the year 1763, there has been no operation of any con&s;equence on the French finances: and in this enviable condition is France at pre&s;ent with regard to her debt.</P>
<P>EVERY body knows that the principal of the debt is but a name; the intere&s;t is the only thing which can di&s;tre&s;s a nation. Take this idea, which will not be di&s;puted, and compare the intere&s;t paid by England with that paid by France:

The author cannot complain, that I &s;tate the in|tere&s;t paid by England as too low. He takes it him&s;elf as the extreme&s;t term. Nobody who knows any thing of the French finances will affirm that I &s;tate the intere&s;t paid by that kingdom too high. It might be ea&s;ily proved to amount to a great deal more: even this is near two millions above what is paid by England.</P>
<P>THERE are three &s;tandards to judge of the good condition of a nation with regard to its finances. 1&s;t, The relief of the people. 2d, The equality of &s;upplies to e&s;tabli&s;hments. 3d, The &s;tate of public credit. Try France on all the&s;e &s;tandards.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH our author very liberally admini&s;ters relief to the people of France, its government has not been altogether &s;o gracious. Since the peace,
<PB N="59" REF="64">
&s;he has taken off but a &s;ingle <HI>Vingtieme,</HI> or &s;hilling in the pound, and &s;ome &s;mall matter in the capi|tation. But, if the government has relieved them in one point, it has only burthened them the more heavily in another. The <HI>Taille,</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">A tax rated by the intendant in each generality on the pre&s;umed fortune of every per&s;on below the degree of a gen|tleman.</NOTE> that grievous and de&s;tructive impo&s;ition, which all their financiers la|ment, without being able to remove or to replace, has been augmented no le&s;s than 6 millions of livres, or 270.000 pounds Engli&s;h. A further augmentation of this or other duties is now talked of; and it is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to their affairs: &s;o exceedingly remote from either truth or veri&s;imili|tude is the author's amazing a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that the bur|thens of France in the war were in a great mea&s;ure temporary, and mu&s;t be greatly dimini&s;hed by a few years of peace.</HI></P>
<P>IN the next place, if the people of France are not lightened with taxes, &s;o neither is the &s;tate di&s;|burthened of charges. I &s;peak from very good information, that the annual income of that &s;tate is at this day 30 millions of livres, or &pound;. 1.350.000 &s;terling, &s;hort of a provi&s;ion for their ordinary peace e&s;tabli&s;hment; &s;o far are they from the at|tempt or even hope to di&s;charge any part of the capital of their enormous debt. Indeed under &s;uch extreme &s;traitne&s;s and di&s;traction labours the whole body of their finances, &s;o far does their charge outrun their &s;upply in every particular, that no man, I believe, who has con&s;idered their affairs with any degree of attention or information, but mu&s;t hourly look for &s;ome extraordinary convul|&s;ion in that whole &s;y&s;tem; the effect of which on France, and even on all Europe, it is difficult to conjecture.</P>

<P>THIS &s;tate of the funds of France and England is &s;ufficient to convince even prejudice and ob&s;ti|nacy, that if France and England are not in the &s;ame condition (as the author affirms they are not) the difference is infinitely to the di&s;advantage of France. This depreciation of their funds has not much the air of a nation lightening burthens and di&s;charging debts.</P>
<P>SUCH is the true comparative &s;tate of the two kingdoms in tho&s;e capital points of view. Now as to the nature of the taxes which provide for this debt, as well as for their ordinary e&s;tabli&s;hments, the author has thought proper to affirm that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they are comparatively light;" that
"&s;he has mort|gaged no &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ive taxes as ours:"</Q>
his effrontery on this head is intolerable. Does the author recollect a &s;ingle tax in England to which &s;omething parallel in nature, and as heavy in bur|then, does not exi&s;t in France; does he not know that the lands of the noble&s;&s;e are &s;till under the load of the greater part of the old feudal charges, from which the gentry of England have been re|lieved for upwards of 100 years, and which were in kind, as well as burthen, much wor&s;e than our modern land tax? Be&s;ides that all the gentry of France &s;erve in the army on very &s;lender pay, and to the utter ruin of their fortunes; all tho&s;e who are
<PB N="61" REF="66">
not noble, have their lands heavily taxed. Does he not know that wine, brandy, &s;oap, candles, leather, &s;alt-petre, gun-powder, are taxed in France? Has he not heard that government in France has made a monopoly of that great article of <HI>&s;alt?</HI> that they compel the people to take a certain quantity of it, and at a certain rate, both rate and quantity fixed at the arbitrary plea&s;ure of the impo&s;er?<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Before the war it was &s;old to, or rather forced on, the con|&s;umer at 11 &s;ous, or about 5d. the pound. What it is at pre|&s;ent, I am not informed. Even this will appear no trivial im|po&s;ition. In London, &s;alt may be had at a penny farthing per pound from the la&s;t retailer.</NOTE> that they pay in France the <HI>Taille,</HI> an arbitrary impo&s;ition on pre&s;umed property? that a tax is laid in fact and name, on the &s;ame arbitrary &s;tandard, upon the acqui&s;itions of their <HI>indu&s;try?</HI> and that in France a heavy <HI>capitation-tax</HI> is al&s;o paid, from the highe&s;t to the very poore&s;t &s;ort of people? have we taxes of &s;uch weight, or any thing at all of the compul&s;ion, in the article of <HI>&s;alt?</HI> do we pay any <HI>taillage,</HI> any <HI>faculty-tax,</HI> any <HI>indu&s;try-tax?</HI> do we pay any <HI>capitation-tax</HI> what&s;oever? I be|lieve the people of London would fall into an agony to hear of &s;uch taxes propo&s;ed upon them as are paid at Paris. There is not a &s;ingle article of provi&s;ion for man or bea&s;t, which enters that great city, and is not exci&s;ed; corn, hay, meal, butchers meat, fi&s;h, fowls, every thing. I do not here mean to cen&s;ure the policy of taxes laid on the con&s;umption of great luxurious cities. I only &s;tate the fact. We &s;hould be with difficulty brought to hear of a tax of 50s. upon every ox &s;old in Smithfield. Yet this tax is paid in Paris. Wine, the lower &s;ort of wine, little better than Engli&s;h &s;mall beer, pays 2d. a bottle. We indeed tax our beer: but the impo|&s;ition on &s;mall beer is very far from heavy. In no
<PB N="62" REF="67">
part of England are eatables of any kind the ob|ject of taxation. In almo&s;t every other country in Europe they are exci&s;ed, more or le&s;s. I have by me the &s;tate of the revenues of many of the prin|cipal nations on the continent; and, on comparing them with ours, I think I am fairly warranted to a&s;&s;ert, that England is the mo&s;t lightly taxed of any of the great &s;tates of Europe. They who&s;e unna|tural and &s;ullen joy ari&s;es from a contemplation of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their country will revolt at this po|&s;ition. But, if I am called upon, I will prove it beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of di&s;pute; even though this proof &s;hould deprive the&s;e gentlemen of the &s;in|gular &s;atisfaction of con&s;idering their country as undone; and though the be&s;t civil government, the be&s;t con&s;tituted, and the be&s;t managed revenue that ever the world beheld, &s;hould be thoroughly vindicated from their perpetual clamours and com|plaints. As to our neighbour and rival France, in addition to what I have here &s;ugge&s;ted, I &s;ay, and when the author choo&s;es formally to deny, I &s;hall formally prove it, that her &s;ubjects pay more than England, on a computation of the wealth of both countries; that her taxes are more injudiciou&s;ly and more oppre&s;&s;ively impo&s;ed; more vexatiou&s;ly collected: come in a &s;maller proportion to the royal coffers, and are le&s;s applied by far to the public &s;ervice. I am not one of tho&s;e who choo&s;e to take the author's word for this happy and flouri&s;hing condition of the French finances, rather than at|tend to the changes, the violent pu&s;hes, and the de&s;pair, of all her own financiers. Does he choo&s;e to be referred for the ea&s;y and happy condition of the &s;ubject in France to the remon&s;trances of their own parliaments, written with &s;uch an eloquence, feeling, and energy, as I have not &s;een exceeded in any other writings? The author may &s;ay, their complaints are exaggerated, and the effects of fac|tion.
<PB N="63" REF="68">
I an&s;wer, that they are the repre&s;entations of numerous, grave, and mo&s;t re&s;pectable bodies of men, upon the affairs of their own country. But, allowing that di&s;content and faction may per|vert the judgment of &s;uch venerable bodies in France, we have as good a right to &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;ame cau&s;es may full as probably have pro|duced from a private, however re&s;pectable per&s;on, that frightful, and, I tru&s;t I have &s;hewn, ground|le&s;s repre&s;entation of our own affairs in Eng|land.</P>
<P>THE author is &s;o con&s;cious of the dangerous ef|fects of that repre&s;entation, that he thinks it ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and very nece&s;&s;ary it is, to guard again&s;t them. He a&s;&s;ures us,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that he has not made that di&s;play of the difficulties of his country, to ex|po&s;e her coun&s;els to the ridicule of other &s;tates, or to provoke a vanqui&s;hed enemy to in&s;ult her; nor to excite the peoples rage again&s;t their go|vernors, or &s;ink them into a de&s;pondency of the public welfare."</Q>
I readily admit this apology for his intentions. God forbid I &s;hould think any man capable of entertaining &s;o execrable and &s;en&s;ele&s;s a de&s;ign. The true cau&s;e of his drawing &s;o &s;hocking a picture is no more than this; and it ought rather to claim our pity than excite our in|dignation; he finds him&s;elf out of power; and this condition is intolerable to him. The &s;ame &s;un which gilds all nature, and exhilarates the whole creation, does not &s;hine upon di&s;appointed am|bition. It is &s;omething that rays out of darkne&s;s, and in&s;pires nothing but gloom and melancholy. Men, in this deplorable &s;tate of mind, find a com|fort in &s;preading the contagion of their &s;pleen. They find an advantage too; for it is a general popular error to imagine the loude&s;t complainers for the public to be the mo&s;t anxious for its wel|fare.
<PB N="64" REF="69">
If &s;uch per&s;ons can an&s;wer the ends of relief and profit to them&s;elves, they are apt to be care|le&s;s enough about either the means or the con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>WHATEVER this complainant's motives may be, the effects can by no po&s;&s;ibility be other than tho&s;e which he &s;o &s;trongly, and I hope truely, di&s;claims all intention of producing. To verify this, the reader has only to con&s;ider how dreadful a picture he has drawn in his 32d page of the &s;tate of this kingdom; &s;uch a picture as, I believe, has hardly been applicable, without &s;ome exaggeration, to the mo&s;t degenerate and undone commonwealth that ever exi&s;ted. Let this view of things be com|pared with the pro&s;pect of a remedy which he pro|po&s;es in the page directly oppo&s;ite and the &s;ub&s;e|quent. I believe no man living could have ima|gined it po&s;&s;ible, except for the &s;ake of burle&s;quing a &s;ubject, to propo&s;e remedies &s;o ridiculou&s;ly di&s;|proportionate to the evil, &s;o full of uncertainty in their operation, and depending for their &s;ucce&s;s in every &s;tep upon the happy event of &s;o many new, dangerous, and vi&s;ionary projects. It is not ami&s;s, that he has thought proper to give the public &s;ome little notice of what they may expect from his friends, when our affairs &s;hall be committed to their management. Let us &s;ee how the accounts of di&s;ea&s;e and remedy are balanced in his State of the Nation. In the fir&s;t place, on the &s;ide of evils, he &s;tates,

Such an enormous difference as that be|tween &pound;. 35.000 and &pound;. 300.000 puts him to a &s;tand. Should he adopt the latter plan of encrea&s;ed expence, he mu&s;t then confe&s;s, that he had, on a former occa&s;ion, egregiou&s;ly trifled with the public; at the &s;ame time all his future promi&s;es of reduction mu&s;t fall to the ground.

He has pinned him down to his &pound;. 35.000; for that is the &s;um he has cho&s;en, not as what he thinks will probably be required, but as making the mo&s;t ample allowance for every po&s;&s;ible contingency. See that author, p. 42 and 43.</NOTE> Thus, according to his own princi|ples,
<PB N="70" REF="73">
this great oeconomi&s;t falls into a vicious pro|digality; and is as far in his e&s;timate from a con|&s;i&s;tency with his own principles as with the real na|ture of the &s;ervices.</P>
<P>STILL, however, his pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment differs from its archetype of 1764, by being, though rai&s;ed in particular parts, upon the whole about &pound;. 141.000 &s;maller. It is improved, he tells us, by the experience of the two la&s;t years. One would have concluded that the peace e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e two years had been le&s;s than that of 1764, in order to &s;ugge&s;t to the author his improvements, which enabled him to reduce it. But how does that turn out?

<P>2d, THAT the &s;um of &pound;. 20.000 allowed for the Foundling Ho&s;pital, and &pound;. 1.800 for American Surveys, will &s;oon cea&s;e to be nece&s;&s;ary, as the &s;er|vices will be compleated.</P>
<P>WHAT follows with regard to the re&s;ources, is very well worthy of the reader's attention.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Of this e&s;timate, &s;ays he,<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">P. 34.</NOTE> upwards of &pound;. 300.000 will be for the plantation &s;ervice; and that &s;um, <HI>I hope,</HI> the people of Ireland and the colonies <HI>might be induced</HI> to take off Great Britain, and

<P>SUCH is the whole of this mighty &s;cheme. Take his reduced e&s;timate, and his further reductions, and his re&s;ources all together, and the re&s;ult will be: He will <HI>certainly</HI> lower the provi&s;ion made for the navy. He will cut off largely (God knows what or how) from the army and ordnance extra|ordinaries. He may be <HI>expected</HI> to cut off more.

<P>IF any one of the&s;e Hopes, Mights, In&s;inua|tions, Expectations, and Inducements, &s;hould fail him, there will be a formidable gaping breach in his whole project. If all of them &s;hould fail, he has left the nation without a glimmering of hope in this thick night of terrors which he has thought fit to &s;pread about us.

<P>BEFORE we examine into the con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;chemes, and the probability of the&s;e &s;avings, let us &s;uppo&s;e them all real and all &s;afe, and then &s;ee what it is they amount to, and how he rea&s;ons on them:

This is the amount of the only articles of &s;aving he &s;pecifies; and yet he choo&s;es to a&s;&s;ert<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">P. 43.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that we may venture on the credit of them to re|duce the &s;tanding expences of the e&s;timate (from &pound;. 3.468.161) to &pound;. 3.300.000;"</Q>
that is, for a &s;aving of &pound;. 58.000, he is not a&s;hamed to take credit for a defalcation from his own ideal e&s;tabli&s;hment in a &s;um of no le&s;s than &pound;. 168.161! Suppo&s;e even that we were to take up the e&s;timate of the Con&s;iderations (which is however aban|doned in the State of the Nation), and reduce his &pound;. 75.000 extraordinaries to the original &pound;. 35.000. &s;till all the&s;e &s;avings joined together give us but &pound;. 98.000; that is, near &pound;. 70.000 &s;hort of the cre|dit he calls for, and for which he has neither given any rea&s;on, nor furni&s;hed any data what&s;oever for others to rea&s;on upon.</P>
<P>SUCH are his &s;avings, as operating on his own project of a peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. Let us now con|&s;ider them as they affect the exi&s;ting e&s;tabli&s;hment and our actual &s;ervices. He tells us, the &s;um al|lowed in his e&s;timate for the navy is
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&pound;. 69.321 le&s;s than the grant for that &s;ervice in 1767; but in that grant &pound;. 30.000 was included for the pur|cha&s;e of hemp, and a &s;aving of about &pound;. 25.000 was made in that year."</Q>
The author has got &s;ome &s;ecret in arithmetic. The&s;e two &s;ums put together amount, in the ordinary way of com|puting, to &pound;. 55.000, and not to &pound;. 69.321. On
<PB N="74" REF="77">
what principle has he cho&s;en to take credit for &pound;. 14.321 more? To what this &s;trange inaccuracy is owing, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly comprehend; nor is it very material, where the logic is &s;o bad, and the policy &s;o erroneous, whether the arithmetic be ju&s;t or otherwi&s;e. But in a &s;cheme for making this nation
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"happy at home and re&s;pected abroad, formidable in war and flouri&s;hing in peace,"</Q>
it is &s;urely a little unfortunate for us, that he has picked out the <HI>Navy,</HI> as the very fir&s;t object of his oeconomical experiments. Of all the public &s;er|vices, that of the navy is the one in which tamper|ing may be of the greate&s;t danger, which can wor&s;t be &s;upplied upon an emergency, and of which any failure draws after it the longe&s;t and heavie&s;t train of con&s;equences. I am far from &s;ay|ing, that this or any &s;ervice ought not to be con|ducted with oeconomy. But I will never &s;uffer the &s;acred name of oeconomy to be be&s;towed upon arbitrary defalcation of charge. The author tells us him&s;elf,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that to &s;uffer the navy to rot in harbour for want of repairs and marines, would be to invite de&s;truction."</Q>
It would be &s;o. When the author talks therefore of &s;avings on the navy e&s;timate, it is incumbent on him to let us know, not what &s;ums he will cut off, but what branch of that &s;ervice he deems &s;uperfluous. In&s;tead of put|ting us off with unmeaning generalities, he ought to have &s;tated what naval force, what naval works, and what naval &s;tores, with the lowe&s;t e&s;timated expence, are nece&s;&s;ary to keep our marine in a condition commen&s;urate to its great ends. And this too not for the contracted and deceitful &s;pace of a &s;ingle year, but for &s;ome rea&s;onable term. Every body knows that many charges cannot be in their nature regular or annual. In the year 1767 a &s;tock of hemp, &amp;c. was to be laid in; that charge intermits, but it does not end. Other charges of
<PB N="75" REF="78">
other kinds take their place. Great works are now carrying on at Port&s;mouth, but not of greater magnitude than utility; and they mu&s;t be provided for. A year's e&s;timate is therefore no ju&s;t idea at all of a permanent peace e&s;tabli&s;hment. Had the author opened this matter upon the&s;e plain princi|ples, a judgment might have been formed, how far he had contrived to reconcile national defence with public oeconomy. Till he has done it, tho&s;e who had rather depend on any man's rea&s;on than the greate&s;t man's authority will not give him cre|dit on this head, for the &s;aving of a &s;ingle &s;hilling. As to tho&s;e &s;avings which are already made, or in cour&s;e of being made, whether right or wrong, he has nothing at all to do with them; they can be no part of his project, con&s;idered as a plan of refor|mation. I greatly fear that the error has not lately been on the &s;ide of profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>ANOTHER head is the &s;aving on the Army and Ordnance extraordinaries, particularly in the Ame|rican branch. What or how much reduction may be made, none of us, I believe, can with any fairne&s;s pretend to &s;ay; very little, I am con|vinced. The &s;tate of America is extremely un|&s;ettled; more troops have been &s;ent thither; new di&s;po&s;itions have been made; and this augmenta|tion of number, and change of di&s;po&s;ition, has rarely, I believe, the effect of le&s;&s;ening the bill for extraordinaries, which, if not this year, yet in the next we mu&s;t certainly feel. Care has not been wanting to introduce oeconomy into that part of the &s;ervice. The author's great friend has made, I admit, &s;ome regulations; his immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have made more and better. This part will be handled more ably and more minutely at another time: but no one can cut down this bill of extra|ordinaries at his plea&s;ure. The author has given
<PB N="76" REF="79">
us nothing, but his word, for any certain or con&s;i|derable reduction; and this we ought to be the more cautious in taking, as he has promi&s;ed great &s;avings in his <HI>Con&s;iderations,</HI> which he has not cho&s;en to abide by in his <HI>State of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>ON this head al&s;o of the American extraordina|ries, he can take credit for nothing. As to his next, the le&s;&s;ening of the deficiency of the land and malt tax, particularly of the malt tax; any per&s;on the lea&s;t conver&s;ant in that &s;ubject cannot avoid a &s;mile. This deficiency ari&s;es from charge of collection, from anticipation, and from defective produce. What has the author &s;aid on the re|duction of any head of this deficiency upon the land tax? On the&s;e points he is ab&s;olutely &s;ilent. As to the deficiency on the malt tax, which is chiefly owing to a defective produce, he has, and can have, nothing to propo&s;e. If this deficiency &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened by the encrea&s;e of malting in any years more than others (as it is a greatly fluc|tuating object), how much of this obligation &s;hall we owe to this author's mini&s;try? will it not be the ca&s;e under any admini&s;tration? mu&s;t it not go to the general &s;ervice of the year, in &s;ome way or other, let the finances be in who&s;e hands they will? But why take credit for &s;o extremely reduced a deficiency at all? I can tell him, he has no rational ground for it in the produce of the year 1767; and I &s;u&s;pect will have full as little rea&s;on from the produce of the year 1768. That produce may indeed become greater, and the deficiency of cour&s;e will be le&s;s. It may too be far otherwi&s;e. A fair and judicious financier will not, as this writer has done, for the &s;ake of making out a &s;pecious ac|count, &s;elect a favourable year or two, at remote periods, and ground his calculations on tho&s;e. In 1768 he will not take the deficiencies of 1753
<PB N="77" REF="80">
and 1754 for his &s;tandard. Sober men have hi|therto (and mu&s;t continue this cour&s;e to pre&s;erve this character) taken indifferently the mediums of the years immediately preceding. But a per&s;on who has a &s;cheme from which he promi&s;es much to the public ought to be &s;till more cautious; he &s;hould ground his &s;peculation rather on the lowe&s;t mediums; becau&s;e all new &s;chemes are known to be &s;ubject to &s;ome defect or failure not fore&s;een; and which therefore every prudent propo&s;er will be ready to allow for, in order to lay his foundation as low and as &s;olid as po&s;&s;ible. Quite contrary is the practice of &s;ome politicians. They fir&s;t pro|po&s;e &s;avings, which they well know cannot be made, in order to get a reputation for oeconomy. In due time they a&s;&s;ume another, but a different method, by providing for the &s;ervice they had be|fore cut off or &s;traitened, and which they can then very ea&s;ily prove to be nece&s;&s;ary. In the &s;ame &s;pirit they rai&s;e magnificent ideas of revenue on funds which they know to be in&s;ufficient. After|wards, who can blame them, if they do not &s;atisfy the public de&s;ires? They are great artificers; but they cannot work without materials.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the little arts of great &s;tate&s;|men. To &s;uch we leave them, and follow where the author leads us, to his next re&s;ource, the Foundling-ho&s;pital. Whatever particular virtue there is in the mode of this &s;aving, there &s;eems to be nothing at all new, and indeed nothing won|derfully important in it. The &s;um annually voted for the &s;upport of the Foundling-ho&s;pital has been in a former parliament limited to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the children then in the ho&s;pital. When they are apprenticed, this provi&s;ion will cea&s;e. It will therefore fall in more or le&s;s at different times; and will at length cea&s;e entirely. But, until it
<PB N="78" REF="81">
does, we cannot reckon upon it as the &s;aving on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of any given year: nor can any one conceive how the author comes to mention this, any more than &s;ome other articles, as a part of a <HI>new</HI> plan of oeconomy which is to retrieve our affairs. This charge will indeed cea&s;e in its own time. But will no other &s;ucceed to it? Has he ever known the public free from &s;ome contingent charge, either for the ju&s;t &s;upport of royal dignity, or for national magnificence, or for public charity, or for public &s;ervice? does he choo&s;e to flatter his readers that no &s;uch will ever return? or does he in good earne&s;t declare, that let the rea&s;on, or nece&s;|&s;ity, be what they will, he is re&s;olved not to pro|vide for &s;uch &s;ervices?</P>
<P>ANOTHER re&s;ource of oeconomy yet remains, for he gleans the field very clo&s;ely, &pound;. 1.800 for the American &s;urveys. Why what &s;ignifies a di&s;pute about trifles? he &s;hall have it. But while he is carrying it off, I &s;hall ju&s;t whi&s;per in his ear, that neither the &s;aving that is allowed, nor that which is doubted of, can at all belong to that future propo&s;|ed admini&s;tration, who&s;e touch is to cure all our evils. Both the one and the other belong equally (as indeed all the re&s;t do) to the pre&s;ent admini|&s;tration, to any admini&s;tration; becau&s;e they are the gift of time, and not the bounty of the ex|chequer.</P>
<P>I HAVE now done with all the minor preparatory parts of the author's &s;cheme, the &s;everal articles of &s;aving which he propo&s;es. At length comes the capital operation, his new re&s;ources. Three hun|dred thou&s;and pounds a year from America and Ireland.&mdash;Alas! alas! if that too &s;hould fail us, what will become of this poor undone nation? The author, in a tone of great humility, <HI>hopes</HI> they may be induced to pay it. Well, if that be
<PB N="79" REF="82">
all, we may hope &s;o too: and for any light he is plea&s;ed to give us into the ground of this hope, and the ways and means of this inducement, here is a &s;peedy end both of the que&s;tion and the re|venue.</P>
<P>IT is the con&s;tant cu&s;tom of this author, in all his writings, to take it for granted, that he has given you a revenue, whenever he can point out to you where you may have money, if you can con|trive how to get at it; and this &s;eems to be the ma&s;ter-piece of his financial ability. I think how|ever, in his way of proceeding, he has behaved rather like an har&s;h &s;tep-dame, than a kind nur&s;ing mother to his country. Why &s;top at &pound;. 300.000? If his &s;tate of things be at all founded, America and Ireland are much better able to pay &pound;. 600.000, than we are to &s;atisfy our&s;elves with half that &s;um. However, let us forgive him this one in&s;tance of tenderne&s;s towards Ireland and the colonies.</P>
<P>HE &s;pends a va&s;t deal of time,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">P. 35.</NOTE> in an endea|vour to prove, that Ireland is able to bear greater impo&s;itions. He is of opinion, that the poverty of the lower cla&s;s of people there is, in a great mea|&s;ure, owing to <HI>a want</HI> of judicious taxes; that a land tax will enrich her tenants; that taxes are paid in England which are not paid there; that the colony trade is encrea&s;ed above &pound;. 100.000 &s;ince the peace; that &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to have further indul|gences in that trade; and <HI>ought</HI> to have further pri|vileges in the woollen manufacture. From the&s;e premi&s;es, of what &s;he has, what &s;he has not, and what &s;he ought to have, he infers that Ireland will contribute &pound;. 100.000 towards the extraordinaries of the American e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>I SHALL make no objections what&s;oever, logical or financial, to this rea&s;oning: many occur; but
<PB N="80" REF="83">
they would lead me from my purpo&s;e, from which I do not intend to be diverted, becau&s;e it &s;eems to me of no &s;mall importance. It will be ju&s;t enough to hint, what I dare &s;ay many readers have before ob&s;erved, that when any man propo&s;es new taxes in a country with which he is not per&s;onally con|ver&s;ant by re&s;idence or office, he ought to lay open its &s;ituation much more minutely and critically than this author has done, or than perhaps he is able to do. He ought not to content him&s;elf with &s;aying that a &s;ingle article of her trade is encrea&s;ed &pound;. 100.000 a year; he ought, if he argues from the encrea&s;e of trade to the encrea&s;e of taxes, to &s;tate the whole trade, and not one branch of trade only; he ought to enter fully into the &s;tate of its remittances, and the cour&s;e of its exchange; he ought likewi&s;e to examine whether all its e&s;tabli&s;h|ments are encrea&s;ed or dimini&s;hed; and whether it incurs or di&s;charges debt annually. But I pa&s;s over all this; and am content to a&s;k a few plain que&s;|tions.</P>
<P>DOES the author then &s;eriou&s;ly mean to propo&s;e in parliament a land tax, or any tax for &pound;. 100.000 a year upon Ireland? if he does, and if fatally, by his temerity and our weakne&s;s, he &s;hould &s;ucceed; then I &s;ay he will throw the whole empire from one end of it to the other into mortal convul&s;ions. What is it that can &s;atisfy the furious and perturbed mind of this man; is it not enough for him that &s;uch projects have alienated our colonies from the mo|ther country, and not to propo&s;e violently to tear our &s;i&s;ter kingdom al&s;o from our &s;ide, and to con|vince every dependent part of the empire, that, when a little money is to be rai&s;ed, we have no &s;ort of regard to their ancient cu&s;toms, their opinions, their circum&s;tances, or their affections? He has however a <HI>douceur</HI> for Ireland in his pocket; bene|fits
<PB N="81" REF="84">
in trade, by opening the woollen manufacture to that nation. A very right idea in my opinion; but not more &s;trong in rea&s;on, than likely to be oppo&s;ed by the mo&s;t powerful and mo&s;t violent of all local prejudices and popular pa&s;&s;ions. Fir&s;t, a fire is already kindled by his &s;chemes of taxation in America; he then propo&s;es one which will &s;et all Ireland in a blaze; and his way of quenching both is by a plan which may kindle perhaps ten times a greater flame in Britain.</P>
<P>WILL the author pledge him&s;elf, previou&s;ly to his propo&s;al of &s;uch a tax, to carry this enlarge|ment of the Iri&s;h trade; if he does not, then the tax will be certain; the benefit will be le&s;s than problematical. In this view, his compen&s;ation to Ireland vani&s;hes into &s;moke; the tax, to their pre|judices, will appear &s;tark naked in the light of an act of arbitrary power and oppre&s;&s;ion. But, if he &s;hould propo&s;e the benefit and tax together, then the people of Ireland, a very high and &s;pirited peo|ple, would think it the wor&s;t bargain in the world. They would look upon the one as wholly vitiated and poi&s;oned by the other; and, if they could not be &s;eparated, would infallibly re&s;i&s;t them both to|gether. Here would be taxes indeed, amounting to an hand&s;ome &s;um; &pound;. 100.000 very effectually voted, and pa&s;&s;ed through the be&s;t and mo&s;t au|thentic forms; but how to be collected?&mdash;This is his perpetual manner. One of his projects depends for &s;ucce&s;s upon another project, and this upon a third, all of them equally vi&s;ionary. His finance is like the Indian philo&s;ophy; his Earth is poi&s;ed on the horns of a Bull, his Bull &s;tands on an Elephant, his Elephant is &s;upported by a Tortoi&s;e; and &s;o on for ever.</P>
<P>As to his American &pound;. 200.000 a year, he is &s;atisfied to repeat gravely, as he has done an hun|dred

times before, that the Americans are able to pay it. Well, and what then? does he lay open any part of his plan how they may be compelled to pay it, without plunging our&s;elves into calamities that outweigh ten-fold the propo&s;ed benefit? or does he &s;hew how they may be induced to &s;ubmit to it quietly; or does he give any &s;atisfaction con|cerning the mode of levying it, in commercial colonies one of the mo&s;t important and difficult of all con&s;iderations? Nothing like it. To the &s;tamp act, whatever its excellencies may be, I think he will not in reality recur, or even choo&s;e to a&s;&s;ert that he means to do &s;o, in ca&s;e his mini&s;ter &s;hould come again into power. If he does, I will predict that &s;ome of the fa&s;te&s;t friends of that mini&s;ter will de&s;ert him upon this point. As to port duties, he has damned them all in the lump, by declaring them<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"contrary to the fir&s;t principles of colo|nization, and not le&s;s prejudicial to the intere&s;ts of Great Britain than to tho&s;e of the colonies."</Q>
Surely this &s;ingle ob&s;ervation of his ought to have taught him a little caution; he ought to have be|gun to doubt, whether there is not &s;omething in the nature of commercial colonies, which renders them an unfit object of taxation; when port duties, &s;o large a fund of revenue in almo&s;t all countries, are by him&s;elf found, in this ca&s;e, not only im|proper, but de&s;tructive. However, he has here pretty well narrowed the field of taxation. Stamp act, hardly to be re&s;umed. Port duties, mi&s;|chievous. Exci&s;es, I believe, he will &s;carcely think worth the collection (if any revenue &s;hould be &s;o) in America. Land tax (notwith&s;tanding his opinion of its immen&s;e u&s;e to agriculture), he will not di|rectly propo&s;e, before he has thought again and again on the &s;ubject. Indeed he very readily re|commends it for Ireland, and &s;eems to think it

not improper for America; becau&s;e, he ob&s;erves, they already rai&s;e mo&s;t of their taxes internally, including this tax. A mo&s;t curious rea&s;on truly! becau&s;e their lands are already heavily burthened, he thinks it right to burthen them &s;till further. But he will recollect, for &s;urely he cannot be ignorant of it, that the lands of America are not, as in England, let at a rent certain in money, and there|fore cannot, as here, be taxed at a certain pound rate. They value them in gro&s;s among them|&s;elves; and none but them&s;elves in their &s;everal di&s;tricts can value them. Without their hearty concurrence and co-operation, it is evident, we cannot advance a &s;tep in the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing or collecting any land tax. As to the taxes which in &s;ome places the Americans pay by the acre, they are merely duties of regulation: they are &s;mall; and to encrea&s;e them, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ecret vir|tues of a land tax, would be the mo&s;t effectual means of preventing that cultivation they are in|tended to promote. Be&s;ides, the whole country is heavily in arrear already for land taxes and quit rents. They have different methods of taxation in the different provinces, agreeable to their &s;everal local circum&s;tances. In New England by far the greate&s;t part of their revenue is rai&s;ed by <HI>faculty taxes</HI> and <HI>capitations.</HI> Such is the method in many others. It is obvious that parliament, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the colonies them&s;elves, cannot take &s;o much as a &s;ingle &s;tep in this mode of taxation. Then what tax is it he will impo&s;e? Why, after all the boa&s;ting &s;peeches and writings of his faction for the&s;e four years, after all the vain expectations which they have held out to a deluded public, this their great advocate, after twi&s;ting the &s;ubject every way, after writhing him&s;elf in every po&s;ture, after knocking at every door, is obliged fairly to aban|don every mode of taxation what&s;oever in America.
<PB N="84" REF="87">
He thinks<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">P. 37, 38.</NOTE> it the be&s;t method for parliament to impo&s;e the &s;um, and re&s;erve the account to it&s;elf, leaving the mode of taxation to the colonies. But how and in what proportion? what does the author &s;ay? O, not a &s;ingle &s;yllable on this the mo&s;t ma|terial part of the whole que&s;tion. Will he, in par|liament, undertake to &s;ettle the proportions of &s;uch payments from Nova Scotia to Nevis, in no fewer than &s;ix and twenty different countries, varying in almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tance one from ano|ther? if he does, I tell him, he adjourns his reve|nue to a very long day. If he leaves it to them|&s;elves to &s;ettle the&s;e proportions, he adjourns it to dooms-day.</P>
<P>THEN what does he get by this method on the &s;ide of acquie&s;cence? will the people of America reli&s;h this cour&s;e, of giving and granting and ap|plying their money, the better becau&s;e their a&s;&s;em|blies are made commi&s;&s;ioners of the taxes? This is far wor&s;e than all his former projects; for here, if the a&s;&s;emblies &s;hall refu&s;e, or delay, or be neg|ligent, or fraudulent, in this new-impo&s;ed duty, we are wholly without remedy; and neither our cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, nor our troops, nor our armed &s;hips, can be of the lea&s;t u&s;e in the col|lection. No idea can be more contemptible (I will not call it an oppre&s;&s;ive one, the har&s;hne&s;s is lo&s;t in the folly) than that of propo&s;ing to get any revenue from the Americans but by their free&s;t and mo&s;t chearful con&s;ent. Mo&s;t monied men know their own intere&s;t right well; and are as able as any financier, in the valuation of ri&s;ks. Yet I think this financier will &s;carcely find that adventurer hardy enough, at any premium, to advance a &s;hil|ling upon a vote of &s;uch taxes. Let him name the man, or &s;et of men, that would do it. This

is the only proof of the value of revenues; what would an intere&s;ted man rate them at? His &s;ub|&s;cription would be at ninety-nine <HI>per cent.</HI> di&s;count the very fir&s;t day of its opening. Here is our only national &s;ecurity from ruin; a &s;ecurity upon which no man in his &s;en&s;es would venture a &s;hilling of his fortune. Yet he puts down tho&s;e articles as gravely in his &s;upply for his peace e&s;tabli&s;hment, as if the money had been all fairly lodged in the exchequer:

Very hand&s;ome indeed! but if &s;upply is to be got in &s;uch a manner, farewell the lucrative my&s;tery of finance!

<P>HERE is the whole of what belongs to the au|thor's &s;cheme for &s;aving us from impending de|&s;truction.

puerile methods for our relief? If the&s;e had been the dreams of &s;ome unknown, unnamed, and namele&s;s writer, they would excite no alarm; their weakne&s;s had been an antidote to their malignity. But as they are univer&s;ally believed to be written by the hand, or, what amounts to the &s;ame thing, under the immediate direction, of a per&s;on who has been in the management of the highe&s;t affairs, and may &s;oon be in the &s;ame &s;ituation, I think it is not to be reckoned among&s;t our greate&s;t con&s;olations, that the yet remaining power of this kingdom is to be employed in an attempt to realize notions that are at once &s;o frivolous, and &s;o full of danger. That con&s;ideration will ju&s;tify me in dwelling a little longer on the difficulties of the na|tion, and the &s;olutions of our author.</P>
<P>I AM then per&s;uaded that he cannot be in the lea&s;t alarmed about our &s;ituation, let his outcry be what he plea&s;es. I will give him a rea&s;on for my opinion, which, I think, he cannot di&s;pute. All that he be&s;tows upon the nation, which it does not po&s;&s;e&s;s without him, and &s;uppo&s;ing it all &s;ure mo|ney, amounts to no more than a &s;um of &pound;. 300.000 a year. This, he thinks, will do the bu&s;ine&s;s com|pleatly, and render us flouri&s;hing at home, and re|&s;pectable abroad. If the option between glory and &s;hame, if our &s;alvation or de&s;truction, depended on this &s;um, it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould have been active, and made a merit of that activity, in taking off a &s;hilling in the pound of the land tax, which came up to his grand de&s;ideratum, and up|wards of &pound;. 100.000 more. By this manoeuvre, he left our trade, navigation, and manufactures, on the verge of de&s;truction, our finances in ruin, our credit expiring, Ireland on the point of being ceded to France, the colonies of being torn to pieces, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown at the mercy of
<PB N="87" REF="90">
our great rival, and the kingdom it&s;elf on the very point of becoming tributary to that haughty power. All this for want of &pound;. 300.000; for I defy the reader to point out any other revenue, or any other preci&s;e and defined &s;cheme of politics, which he a&s;&s;igns for our redemption.</P>
<P>I KNOW that two things may be &s;aid in his de|fence, as bad rea&s;ons are always at hand in an in|different cau&s;e; that he was not &s;ure the money would be applied as he thinks it ought to be, by the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters. I think as ill of them as he does to the full. They have done very near as much mi&s;chief as they can do, to a con&s;titution &s;o robu&s;t as this is. Nothing can make them more dangerous, but that, as they are already in general compo&s;ed of his di&s;ciples and in&s;truments, they may add to the public calamity of their own mea|&s;ures, the adoption of his projects. But be the mi|ni&s;ters what they may, the author knows that they could not avoid applying this &pound;. 450.000 to the &s;ervice of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, as faithfully as he, or any other mini&s;ter, could do. I &s;ay they could not avoid it, and have no merit at all for the ap|plication. But &s;uppo&s;ing that they &s;hould greatly mi&s;manage this revenue. Here is a good deal of room for mi&s;take and prodigality before you come to the edge of ruin. The difference between the amount of that real and his imaginary revenue is, &pound;. 150.000 a year, at lea&s;t; a tolerable &s;um for them to play with: this might compen&s;ate the dif|ference between the author's oeconomy and their profu&s;ion; and &s;till, notwith&s;tanding their vices and ignorance, the nation might be &s;aved. The author ought al&s;o to recollect, that a good man would hardly deny, even to the wor&s;t of mini&s;ters, the means of doing their duty; e&s;pecially in a cri&s;is when our being depended on &s;upplying them with
<PB N="88" REF="91">
&s;ome means or other. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, their penury of mind, in di&s;covering re&s;ources, would make it rather the more nece&s;&s;ary, not to &s;trip &s;uch poor providers of the little &s;tock they had in hand.</P>
<P>BESIDES, here is another &s;ubject of di&s;tre&s;s, and a very &s;erious one, which puts us again to a &s;tand. The author may po&s;&s;ibly not come into power (I only &s;tate the po&s;&s;ibility): he may not always con|tinue in it; and if the contrary to all this &s;hould fortunately for us happen, what in&s;urance on his life can be made for a &s;um adequate to his lo&s;s? Then we are thus unluckily &s;ituated, that the <HI>chance</HI> of an American and Iri&s;h revenue of &pound;. 300.000, to be managed by him, is to &s;ave us from ruin two or three years hence at be&s;t, to make us happy at home and glorious abroad; and the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &pound;. 450.000 Engli&s;h taxes cannot &s;o much as protract our ruin without him. So we are &s;taked on four chances; his power, its perma|nence, the &s;ucce&s;s of his projects, and the duration of his life. Any one of the&s;e failing, we are gone. <HI>Propria haec &s;i dona fui&s;&s;ent!</HI> This is no unfair repre|&s;entation; ultimately all hangs on his life, becau&s;e, in his account of every &s;et of men that have held or &s;upported admini&s;tration, he finds neither virtue nor ability in any but him&s;elf. Indeed he pays (through their mea&s;ures) &s;ome compliments to Lord Bute and Lord De&s;pen&s;er. But to the latter, this is, I &s;uppo&s;e, but a civility to old acquaint|ance: to the former, a little &s;troke of politics. We may therefore fairly &s;ay, that our only hope is his life; and he has, to make it the more &s;o, taken care to cut off any re&s;ource which we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in|dependent of him.</P>
<P>IN the next place it may be &s;aid, to excu&s;e any appearance of incon&s;i&s;tency between the author's actions and his declarations, that he thought it
<PB N="89" REF="92">
right to relieve the landed intere&s;t, and lay the bur|then, where it ought to lie, on the colonies. What! to take off a revenue &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to our being, before any thing what&s;oever was acquired in the place of it? In prudence, he ought to have waited at lea&s;t for the fir&s;t quarter's receipt of the new anonymous American revenue, and Iri&s;h land tax. Is there &s;omething &s;o &s;pecific for our di&s;orders in American, and &s;omething &s;o poi&s;onous in Engli&s;h money, that one is to heal, the other to de&s;troy us? To &s;ay that the landed intere&s;t <HI>could</HI> not continue to pay it for a year or two longer, is more than the author will attempt to prove. To &s;ay that they <HI>would</HI> pay it no longer, is to treat the landed inte|re&s;t, in my opinion, very &s;curvily. To &s;uppo&s;e that the gentry, clergy, and freeholders of Eng|land do not rate the commerce, the credit, the re|ligion, the liberty, the independency of their country, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their crown, at a &s;hilling in the pound land tax! They never gave him rea&s;on to think &s;o meanly of them. And, if I am rightly informed, when that mea&s;ure was de|bated in parliament, a very different rea&s;on was a&s;|&s;igned by the author's great friend, as well as by others, for that reduction: one very different from the critical and almo&s;t de&s;perate &s;tate of our finan|ces. Some people then endeavoured to prove, that the reduction might be made without detriment to the national credit, or the due &s;upport of a pro|per peace e&s;tabli&s;hment; otherwi&s;e it is obvious that the reduction could not be defended in argu|ment. So that this author cannot de&s;pair &s;o much of the commonwealth, without this American and Iri&s;h revenue, as he pretends to do. If he does, the reader &s;ees how hand&s;omely he has provided for us, by voting away one revenue, and by giving us a pamphlet on the other.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93">I DO not mean to blame the relief which was then given by parliament to the land. It was grounded on very weighty rea&s;ons. The admini|&s;tration contended only for its continuance for a year, in order to have the merit of taking off the &s;hilling in the pound immediately before the electi|ons; and thus to bribe the freeholders of England with their own money.</P>
<P>IT is true, the author, in his e&s;timate of ways and means, takes credit for &pound;. 400.000 a year, <HI>Indian revenue.</HI> But he will not very po&s;itively in&s;i&s;t, that we &s;hould put this revenue to the account of his plans or his power; and for a very plain rea&s;on: we are already near two years in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. By what means we came to that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is a pretty long &s;tory; however, I &s;hall give nothing more than a &s;hort ab&s;tract of the proceeding, in order to &s;ee whether the author will take to him&s;elf any part in that mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE fact is this; the Ea&s;t India company had for a good while &s;olicited the mini&s;try for a negotia|tion, by which they propo&s;ed to pay largely for &s;ome advantages in their trade, and for the renewal of their charter. This had been the former me|thod of tran&s;acting with that body. Government having only lea&s;ed the monopoly for &s;hort terms, the company has been obliged to re&s;ort to it fre|quently for renewals. The&s;e two parties had al|ways negotiated (on the true principle of credit) not as government and &s;ubject, but as equal dealers, on the footing of mutual advantage. The public had derived great benefit from &s;uch dealing. But at that time new ideas prevailed. The mini&s;try, in&s;tead of li&s;tening to the propo&s;als of that compa|ny, cho&s;e to &s;et up a claim of the crown to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The original plan &s;eems to have been, to get the hou&s;e of commons to compliment the
<PB N="91" REF="94">
crown with a &s;ort of juridical declaration of a title to the company's acqui&s;itions in India; which the crown, on its part, with the be&s;t air in the world, was to be&s;tow upon the public. Then it would come to the turn of the hou&s;e of commons again to be liberal and grateful to the crown. The civil li&s;t debts were to be paid off; with perhaps a pretty augmentation of income. All this was to be done on the mo&s;t public-&s;pirited principles, and with a politene&s;s and mutual interchange of good offices, that could not but have charmed. But, what was be&s;t of all, the&s;e civilities were to be without a far|thing of charge to either of the kind and obliging parties.&mdash;The Ea&s;t India company was to be co|vered with infamy and di&s;grace, and at the &s;ame time was to pay the whole bill.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this &s;cheme, the terrors of a parliamentary inquiry were hung over them. A judicature was a&s;&s;erted in parliament to try this que&s;tion. But, le&s;t this judicial character &s;hould chance to in&s;pire certain &s;tubborn ideas of law and right, it was argued, that the judicature was arbi|trary, and ought not to determine by the rules of law, but by their opinion of policy and expedi|ency. Nothing exceeded the violence of &s;ome of the managers, except their impotence. They were bewildered by their pa&s;&s;ions, and by their want of knowledge or want of con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject. The more they advanced, the further they found them&s;elves from their object.&mdash;All things ran into confu&s;ion. The mini&s;ters quarrelled among them|&s;elves. They di&s;claimed one another. They &s;u&s;|pended violence, and &s;hrunk from treaty. The in|quiry was almo&s;t at its la&s;t ga&s;p; when &s;ome active per&s;ons of the company were given to under&s;tand, that this ho&s;tile proceeding was only &s;et up <HI>in terrorem</HI>; that government was far from an inten|tion of &s;eizing upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the company.
<PB N="92" REF="95">
Admini&s;tration, they &s;aid, was &s;en&s;ible, that the idea was in every light full of ab&s;urdity; and that &s;uch a &s;eizure was not more out of their power, than remote from their wi&s;hes; and therefore, if the company would come in a liberal manner to the hou&s;e, they certainly could not fail of putting a &s;peedy end to this di&s;agreeable bu&s;ine&s;s, and of opening the way to an advantageous treaty.</P>
<P>ON this hint the company acted: they came at once to a re&s;olution of getting rid of the difficul|ties which aro&s;e from the complication of their trade with their revenue; a &s;tep which de&s;poiled them of their be&s;t defen&s;ive armour, and put them at once into the power of admini&s;tration. They threw their whole &s;tock of every kind, the reve|nue, the trade, and even their debt from govern|ment, into one fund, which they computed on the &s;ure&s;t grounds would amount to &pound;. 800.000, with a large probable &s;urplus for the payment of debt. Then they agreed to divide this &s;um in equal portions between them&s;elves and the public, &pound;. 400.000 to each. This gave to the proprietors of that fund an annual augmentation of no more than &pound;. 80.000 dividend. They ought to receive from government &pound;. 120.000 for the loan of their capital. So that, in fact, the whole, which on this plan they re&s;erved to them&s;elves, from their va&s;t re|venues, from their exten&s;ive trade, and in con&s;ide|ration of the great ri&s;ks and mighty expences which purcha&s;ed the&s;e advantages, amounted to no more than &pound;. 280.000, whil&s;t government was to re|ceive, as I &s;aid, &pound;. 400.000.</P>
<P>THIS propo&s;al was thought by them&s;elves liberal indeed; and they expected the highe&s;t applau&s;es for it. However, their reception was very different from their expectations. When they brought up their plan to the hou&s;e of commons, the offer, as it
<PB N="93" REF="96">
was natural, of &pound;. 400.000, was very well reli&s;hed. But nothing could be more di&s;gu&s;tful than the &pound;. 80.000 which the company had divided among&s;t them&s;elves. A violent tempe&s;t of public indigna|tion and fury ro&s;e again&s;t them. The heads of people turned. The company was held well able to pay &pound;. 400.000 a year to government; but bank|rupts, if they attempted to divide the fifth part of it among them&s;elves. An <HI>ex po&s;t facto</HI> law was brought in with great precipitation, for annulling this divi|dend. In the bill was in&s;erted a clau&s;e, which &s;u&s;|pended for about a year the right, which, under the public faith, the company enjoyed, of making their own dividends. Such was the di&s;po&s;ition and tem|per of the hou&s;e, that, although the plain face of facts, rea&s;on, arithmetic, all the authority, parts, and elo|quence in the kingdom, were again&s;t this bill; though all the chancellors of the exchequer, who had held that office from the beginning of this reign, oppo&s;ed it; yet a few placemen of the &s;ubordinate departments &s;prung out of their ranks, took the lead, and, by an opinion <HI>of &s;ome &s;ort of &s;ecret &s;upport,</HI> car|ried the bill with an high hand, leaving the then &s;e|cretary of &s;tate and the chancellor of the exchequer in a very moderate minority. In this di&s;tracted &s;ituation, the managers of the bill, notwith&s;tanding their triumph, did not venture to propo&s;e the pay|ment of the civil li&s;t debt. The chancellor of the exchequer was not in good humour enough, after his late defeat by his own troops, to co-operate in &s;uch a de&s;ign; &s;o they made an act, to lock up the money in the exchequer until they &s;hould have time to look about them, and &s;ettle among them&s;elves what they were to do with it.</P>
<P>THUS ended this unparalleled tran&s;action. The author, I believe, will not claim any part of the glory of it: he will leave it whole and entire to the
<PB N="94" REF="97">
authors of the mea&s;ure. The money was the vo+luntary free gift of the company; the re&s;cinding bill was the act of legi&s;lature, to which they and we owe &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion: the author has nothing to do with the one or with the other. However, he cannot avoid rub|bing him&s;elf again&s;t this &s;ubject, merely for the plea&s;ure of &s;tirring controver&s;ies, and gratifying a certain pruriency of taxation that &s;eems to infect his blood. It is merely to indulge him&s;elf in &s;peculati|ons of taxing, that he choo&s;es to harangue on this &s;ubject. For he takes credit for no greater &s;um than the public is already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. He does not hint, that the company means, or has ever &s;hewn any di&s;po&s;ition, if managed with common prudence, to pay le&s;s in future; and he cannot doubt that the pre&s;ent mini&s;try are as well inclined to drive them, by their mock enquiries, and real re&s;cinding bills, as he can po&s;&s;ibly be with his taxes. Be&s;ides, it is obvious, that as great a &s;um might have been drawn from that company, without affecting property, or &s;haking the con&s;titution, or endanger|ing the principle of public credit, or running into his golden dreams of cockets on the Ganges, or vi&s;ions of &s;tamp duties on <HI>Pervanna's, Du&s;tics, Ki&s;tbundees,</HI> and <HI>Hu&s;bulhookums.</HI> For once, I will di&s;appoint him in this part of the di&s;pute; and only in a few words recommend to his con&s;ideration, how he is to get off the dangerous idea of taxing a public fund, if he levies tho&s;e duties in England; and if he is to levy them in India, what provi&s;ion he has made for a revenue e&s;tabli&s;hment there; &s;up|po&s;ing that he undertakes this new &s;cheme of finance independently of the company, and again&s;t its in|clinations.</P>
<P>SO much for the&s;e revenues; which are nothing but his vi&s;ions, or already the national po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions without any act of his. It is ea&s;y to parade with an
<PB N="95" REF="98">
high talk of parliamentary rights, of the univer&s;ality of legi&s;lative powers, and of uniform taxation. Men of &s;en&s;e, when new projects come before them, al|ways think a di&s;cour&s;e proving the mere right or mere power of acting in the manner propo&s;ed, to be no more than a very unplea&s;ant way of mi&s;pend|ing time. They mu&s;t &s;ee the object to be of pro|per magnitude to engage them; they mu&s;t &s;ee the means of compa&s;&s;ing it to be next to certain; the mi&s;chiefs not to counterbalance the profit; they will examine how a propo&s;ed impo&s;ition or regula|tion agrees with the opinion of tho&s;e who are likely to be affected by it; they will not de&s;pi&s;e the con&s;i|deration even of their habitudes and prejudices. They wi&s;h to know how it accords or di&s;agrees with the true &s;pirit of prior e&s;tabli&s;hments, whether of go|vernment or of finance; becau&s;e they well know, that in the complicated oeconomy of great kingdoms, and immen&s;e revenues, which in a length of time, and by a variety of accidents, have coale&s;ced into a &s;ort of body, an attempt towards a compul&s;ory equality in all circum&s;tances, and an exact practical definiti|on of the &s;upreme rights in every ca&s;e, is the mo&s;t dangerous and chimerical of all enterprizes. The old building &s;tands well enough, though part Go|thic, part Grecian, and part Chine&s;e, until an at|tempt is made to &s;quare it into uniformity. Then it may come down upon our heads all together, in much uniformity of ruin; and great will be the fall thereof. Some people, in&s;tead of inclining to de|bate the matter, only feel a &s;ort of nau&s;ea, when they are told, that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"protection calls for &s;upply," and that,
"all the parts ought to contribute to the &s;up|port of the whole."</Q>
Strange argument for great and grave deliberation! As if the &s;ame end may not, and mu&s;t not, be compa&s;&s;ed, according to its circum&s;tances, by a great diver&s;ity of ways. Thus in Great Britain &s;ome of our e&s;tabli&s;hments are apt

for the &s;upport of credit. They &s;tand therefore upon a principle of their own, di&s;tinct from, and in &s;ome re&s;pects contrary to, the relation between prince and &s;ubject. It is a new &s;pecies of contract &s;uperinduced upon the old contract of the &s;tate. The idea of power mu&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible be bani&s;hed from it; for power and credit are things adver&s;e, incompatible; <HI>Non bene conveniunt, nec in una &s;ede morantur.</HI> Such e&s;tabli&s;hments are our great <HI>monied</HI> companies. To tax them would be critical and dangerous, and contradictory to the very purpo&s;e of their in&s;titution; which is credit, and cannot therefore be taxation. But the nation, when it gave up that power, did not give up the advantage; but &s;uppo&s;ed, and with rea&s;on, that government was overpaid in credit for what it &s;eemed to lo&s;e in authority. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, to talk of the rights of &s;overeignty, is quite idle. Other e&s;tabli&s;hments &s;upply other modes of public contribution. Our <HI>trading</HI> companies, as well as individual importers, are a fit &s;ubject of revenue by cu&s;toms. Some e&s;ta|bli&s;hments pay us by a <HI>monopoly</HI> of their con&s;ump|tion and their produce. This, nominally no tax, in reality comprehends all taxes. Such e&s;tabli&s;h|ments are our colonies. To tax them, would be as erroneous in policy, as rigorous in equity. Ire|land &s;upplies us by furni&s;hing troops in war; and by bearing part of our foreign e&s;tabli&s;hment in peace. She aids us at all times by the money that her ab&s;entees &s;pend among&s;t us; which is no &s;mall part of the rental of that kingdom. Thus Ireland contributes her part. Some objects bear port du|ties. Some are fitter for an inland exci&s;e. The mode varies, the object is the &s;ame. To &s;train the&s;e from their old and inveterate leanings, might im|pair the old benefit, and not an&s;wer the end of the new project.

He would, I conceive, be a very indifferent farmer, who complained that his &s;heep did not plough, or his hor&s;es yield him wool; tho' it would be an idea full of equality.

<P>As the author has &s;tated this Indian taxation for no vi&s;ible purpo&s;e relative to his plan of &s;upply, &s;o he has &s;tated many other projects with as little, if any di&s;tinct end; unle&s;s perhaps to &s;hew you how full he is of projects for the public good; and what va&s;t expectations may be formed of him or his friends, if they &s;hould be tran&s;lated into admini|&s;tration. It is always from &s;ome opinion that the&s;e &s;peculations may one day become our public mea|&s;ures, that I think it worth while to trouble the reader at all about them.</P>
<P>Two of them &s;tand out in high relievo beyond the re&s;t. The fir&s;t is a change in the internal re|pre&s;entation of this country, by enlarging our num|ber of con&s;tituents. The &s;econd is an addition to our repre&s;entatives, by new American members of parliament. I pa&s;s over here all con&s;iderations how far &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem will be an improvement of our con&s;titution according to any &s;ound theory. Not that I mean to condemn &s;uch &s;peculative en|quiries concerning this great object of the national attention. They may tend to clear doubtful points, and po&s;&s;ibly may lead, as they have often done, to real improvements. What I object to, is their
<PB N="98" REF="101">
introduction into a di&s;cour&s;e relating to the imme|diate &s;tate of our affairs, and recommending plans of practical government. In this view, I &s;ee no|thing in them but what is u&s;ual with the author; an attempt to rai&s;e di&s;content in the people of Eng|land, to balance tho&s;e di&s;contents the mea&s;ures of his friends had already rai&s;ed in America. What other rea&s;on can he have for &s;ugge&s;ting, that we are not happy enough to enjoy a &s;ufficient number of voters in England? I believe that mo&s;t &s;ober thinkers on this &s;ubject are rather of opinion, that our fault is on the other &s;ide; and that it would be more in the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution, and more agreeable to the pattern of our be&s;t laws, by le&s;|&s;ening the number, to add to the weight and in|dependency of our voters. And truly, con&s;ider|ing the immen&s;e and dangerous charge of elections; the pro&s;titute and daring venality, the corruption of manners, the idlene&s;s and profligacy of the lower &s;ort of voters, no prudent man would propo&s;e to increa&s;e &s;uch an evil, if it be, as I fear it is, out of our power to admini&s;ter to it any remedy. The author propo&s;es nothing further. If he has any improvements that may balance or may le&s;&s;en this inconvenience, he has thought proper to keep them as u&s;ual in his own brea&s;t. Since he has been &s;o re&s;erved, I &s;hould have wi&s;hed he had been as cau|tious with regard to the project it&s;elf. Fir&s;t, be|cau&s;e he ob&s;erves ju&s;tly, that his &s;cheme, however it might improve the platform, can add nothing to the authority of the legi&s;lature; much I fear, it will have a contrary operation: for, authority de|pending on opinion at lea&s;t as much as on duty, an idea circulated among the people that our con&s;titu|tion is not &s;o perfect as it ought to be, before you are &s;ure of mending it, is a certain method of le&s;|&s;ening it in the public opinion. Of this irreverent opinion of parliament, the author him&s;elf complains
<PB N="99" REF="102">
in one part of his book; and he endeavours to in|crea&s;e it in the other.</P>
<P>HAS he well con&s;idered what an immen&s;e ope|ration any change in our con&s;titution is? how many di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, parties, and pa&s;&s;ions, it will nece&s;&s;arily excite; and, when you open it to enquiry in one part, where the enquiry will &s;top? Experience &s;hews us, that no time can be fit for &s;uch changes but a time of general confu&s;ion; when good men, finding every thing already broke up, think it right to take advantage of the opportunity of &s;uch derangement in favour of an u&s;eful alteration. Per|haps a time of the greate&s;t &s;ecurity and tranquillity both at home and abroad may likewi&s;e be fit; but will the author affirm this to be ju&s;t &s;uch a time? Transferring an idea of military to civil prudence, he ought to know how dangerous it is to make an alteration of your di&s;po&s;ition in the face of an enemy.</P>
<P>NOW comes his American repre&s;entation. Here too, as u&s;ual, he takes no notice of any difficulty, nor &s;ays any thing to obviate tho&s;e objections that mu&s;t naturally ari&s;e in the minds of his readers. He throws you his politics as he does his revenue; do you make &s;omething of them if you can. Is not the reader a little a&s;toni&s;hed at the propo&s;al of an Ame|rican repre&s;entation from that quarter? It is pro|po&s;ed<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P. 39, 40.</NOTE> merely as a project of &s;peculative im|provement; not from the nece&s;&s;ity in the ca&s;e, not to add any thing to the authority of parliament: but that we may afford a greater attention to the con|cerns of the Americans, and give them a better opportunity of &s;tating their grievances, and of ob|taining redre&s;s. I am glad to find the author has at length di&s;covered that we have not given a &s;uffi|cient attention to their concerns, or a proper redre&s;s to their grievances. His great friend would once
<PB N="100" REF="103">
have been exceedingly di&s;plea&s;ed with any per&s;on, who &s;hould tell him, that he did not attend &s;uffici|ently to tho&s;e concerns. He thought he did &s;o, when he regulated the colonies over and over again: he thought he did &s;o, when he formed two general &s;y&s;tems of revenue; one of port-duties, and the other of internal taxation. The&s;e &s;y&s;tems &s;uppo&s;ed, or ought to &s;uppo&s;e, the greate&s;t attention to, and the mo&s;t detailed information of, all their affairs. However, by contending for the American repre|&s;entation, he &s;eems at la&s;t driven virtually to ad|mit, that great caution ought to be u&s;ed in the ex|erci&s;e of <HI>all</HI> our legi&s;lative rights over an object &s;o remote from our eye, and &s;o little connected with our immediate feelings; that in prudence we ought not to be quite &s;o ready with our taxes, until we can &s;ecure the de&s;ired repre&s;entation in parliament. Perhaps it may be &s;ome time before this hopeful &s;cheme can be brought to perfect maturity; al|though the author &s;eems to be no wi&s;e aware of any ob&s;tructions that lie in the way of it. He talks of his union, ju&s;t as he does of his taxes and his &s;av|ings, with as much <HI>&s;ang froid</HI> and ea&s;e, as if his wi&s;h and the enjoyment were exactly the &s;ame thing. He appears not to have troubled his head with the infinite difficulty of &s;ettling that repre&s;entation on a fair balance of wealth and numbers throughout the &s;everal provinces of America and the We&s;t Indies, under &s;uch an infinite variety of circum&s;tances. It co&s;ts him nothing to fight with nature, and to conquer the order of Providence, which manife&s;tly oppo&s;es it&s;elf to the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a parliamen|tary union.</P>
<P>BUT let us, to indulge his pa&s;&s;ion for projects and power, &s;uppo&s;e the happy time arrived, when the author comes into the mini&s;try, and is to reali&s;e his &s;peculations. The writs are i&s;&s;ued for electing
<PB N="101" REF="104">
members for America and the We&s;t-Indies. Some provinces receive them in &s;ix weeks, &s;ome in ten, &s;ome in twenty. A ve&s;&s;el may be lo&s;t, and then &s;ome provinces may not receive them at all. But let it be, that they all receive them at once, and in the &s;horte&s;t time. A proper &s;pace mu&s;t be given for proclamation and for the election; &s;ome weeks at lea&s;t. But the members are cho&s;en; and, if &s;hips are ready to &s;ail, in about &s;ix more they ar|rive in London. In the mean time the parliament has &s;at and bu&s;ine&s;s far advanced without American repre&s;entatives. Nay by this time, it may happen, that the parliament is di&s;&s;olved; and then the members &s;hip them&s;elves again, to be again elect|ed. The writs may arrive in America, before the poor members of a parliament in which they never &s;at, can arrive at their &s;everal provinces. A new intere&s;t is formed, and they find other members are cho&s;en whil&s;t they are on the high &s;eas. But, if the writs and members arrive together, here is at be&s;t a new trial of &s;kill among&s;t the candidates, after one &s;et of them have well aired them&s;elves with their two voyages of 6000 miles.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in order to facilitate every thing to the author, we will &s;uppo&s;e them all once more elected, and &s;teering again to Old England, with a good heart, and a fair we&s;terly wind in their &s;tern. On their arrival, they find all in a hurry and bu&s;tle; in and out; condolance and congratulation; the crown is demi&s;ed. Another parliament is to be called. Away back to America again on a fourth voyage, and to a third election. Does the author mean to make our kings as immortal in their per|&s;onal as in their politic character? or, whil&s;t he bountifully adds to their life, will he take from them their prerogative of di&s;&s;olving parliaments, in favour of the American union? or are the Ameri|can
<PB N="102" REF="105">
repre&s;entatives to be perpetual, and to feel neither demi&s;es of the crown, nor di&s;&s;olutions of parliament?</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e things may be granted to him, with|out bringing him much nearer to his point. What does he think of re-election? is the American mem|ber the only one who is not to take a place, or the only one to be exempted from the ceremony of re-election? How will this great politician pre&s;erve the rights of electors, the fairne&s;s of returns, and the privilege of the hou&s;e of commons, as the &s;ole judge of &s;uch conte&s;ts? It would undoubtedly be a glorious &s;ight to have eight or ten petitions, or double returns, from Bo&s;ton and Barbadoes, from Philadelphia and Jamaica, the members returned, and the petitioners, with all their train of attornies, &s;olicitors, mayors, &s;elect-men, provo&s;t-mar&s;hals, and about five hundred or a thou&s;and witne&s;&s;es, come to the bar of the hou&s;e of commons. Po&s;&s;ibly we might be interrupted in the enjoyment of this plea&s;ing &s;pectacle, if a war &s;hould break out, and our con&s;titutional fleet, loaded with members of parliament, returning officers, petitioners, and wit|ne&s;&s;es, the electors and elected, &s;hould become a prize to the French or Spaniards, and be conveyed to Carthagena or to La Vera Cruz, and from thence perhaps to Mexico or Lima, there to remain until a cartel for members of parliament can be &s;ettled, or until the war is ended.</P>
<P>IN truth, the author has little &s;tudied this bu&s;i|ne&s;s; or he might have known, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable provinces of America, &s;uch for in&s;tance as Connecticut and Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;ett's Bay, have not in each of them two men who can afford, at a di&s;tance from their e&s;tates, to &s;pend a thou&s;and pounds a year. How can the&s;e provinces be re|pre&s;ented at We&s;tmin&s;ter? If their province pays
<PB N="103" REF="106">
them, they are American agents, with &s;alaries, and not independent members of parliament. It is true, that formerly in England members had &s;ala|ries from their con&s;tituents; but they all had &s;ala|ries, and were all, in this way, upon a par. If the&s;e American repre&s;entatives have no &s;alaries, then they mu&s;t add to the li&s;t of our pen&s;ioners and dependants at court, or they mu&s;t &s;tarve. There is no alternative.</P>
<P>ENOUGH of this vi&s;ionary union; in which much extravagance appears without any fancy, and the judgment is &s;hocked without any thing to refre&s;h the imagination. It looks as if the author had dropped down from the moon, without any know|ledge of the general nature of this globe, of the general nature of its inhabitants, without the lea&s;t acquaintance with the affairs of this country. Go|vernal Pownal has handled the &s;ame &s;ubject. To do him ju&s;tice, he treats it upon far more rational principles of &s;peculation; and much more like a man of bu&s;ine&s;s. He thinks (erroneou&s;ly, I con|ceive; but he does think) that our legi&s;lative rights are incomplete without &s;uch a repre&s;entation. It is no wonder, therefore, that he endeavours by every means to obtain it. Not like our author, who is always on velvet, he is aware of &s;ome diffi|culties; and he propo&s;es &s;ome &s;olutions. But na|ture is too hard for both the&s;e authors; and Ame|rica is, and ever will be, without actual repre&s;en|tation in the hou&s;e of commons; nor will any mi|ni&s;ter be wild enough even to propo&s;e &s;uch a re|pre&s;entation in parliament; however he may choo&s;e to throw out that project, together with others equally far from his real opinions and remote from his de&s;igns, merely to fall in with the different views, and captivate the affections, of different &s;orts of men.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="107">WHETHER the&s;e projects ari&s;e from the author's real political principles, or are only brought out in &s;ub&s;ervience to his political views, they compo&s;e the whole of any thing that is like preci&s;e and defi|nite, which the author has given us to expect from that admini&s;tration which is &s;o much the &s;ubject of his prai&s;es and prayers. As to his general propo&s;i|tions, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"there is a deal of difference between impo&s;&s;ibilities and great difficulties;"
that
 "a great &s;cheme cannot be carried, unle&s;s made the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive admini&s;trations;"
that
 "virtuous and able men are the fitte&s;t to &s;erve their country;"</Q>
all this I look on as no more than &s;o much rubble to fill up the &s;paces between the re|gular ma&s;onry. Pretty much in the &s;ame light I cannot forbear con&s;idering his detached ob&s;ervations on commerce; &s;uch as, that<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. 39.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;y&s;tem for colony regulations would be very &s;imple, and mutually beneficial to Great Britain and her co|lonies, if the old navigation laws were adhered to." That
"the tran&s;portation &s;hould be in all ca&s;es in &s;hips belonging to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects." That
"even Briti&s;h &s;hips &s;hould not be <HI>generally</HI> received into the colonies from any part of Eu|rope, except the dominions of Great Britain."&mdash;That
"it is unrea&s;onable that corn and &s;uch like products &s;hould be re&s;trained to come fir&s;t to a Briti&s;h port."</Q>
What do all the&s;e fine ob&s;erva|tions &s;ignify? &s;ome of them condemn as ill prac|tices, things that were never practi&s;ed at all. Some recommend to be done, things that always have been done. Others indeed convey, though ob|liquely and loo&s;ely, &s;ome in&s;inuations highly dan|gerous to our commerce. If I could prevail on my&s;elf to think the author meant to ground any practice upon the&s;e general propo&s;itions, I &s;hould think it very nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k a few que&s;tions about
<PB N="105" REF="108">
&s;ome of them. For in&s;tance, what does he mean by talking of an adherence to the old navigation laws? does he mean, that the particular law, 12 Car. II. c. 19, commonly called
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The act of navigation,"</Q>
is to be adhered to, and that the &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent additions, amendments, and ex|ceptions, ought to be all repealed? If &s;o, he will make a &s;trange havock in the whole &s;y&s;tem of our trade laws, which have been univer&s;ally acknow|ledged to be full as well founded in the alterations and exceptions, as the act of Charles the &s;econd in the original provi&s;ions; and to pur&s;ue full as wi&s;ely the great end of that very politic law, the encrea&s;e of the Briti&s;h navigation. I fancy the writer could hardly propo&s;e any thing more alarming to tho&s;e immediately intere&s;ted in that navigation than &s;uch a repeal. If he does not mean this, he has got no farther than a nugatory propo&s;ition, which nobody can contradict, and for which no man is the wi&s;er.</P>
<P>THAT
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the regulations for the colony trade would be few and &s;imple if the old navigation-laws were adhered to,"</Q>
I utterly deny as a fact. That they ought to be &s;o, &s;ounds well enough; but this propo&s;ition is of the &s;ame nugatory nature with &s;ome of the former. The regulations for the colony trade ought not to be more nor fewer, nor more or le&s;s complex, than the occa&s;ion requires. And, as that trade is in a great mea&s;ure a &s;y&s;tem of art and re&s;triction, they can neither be few nor &s;imple. It is true, that the very principle may be de&s;troyed, by multiplying to exce&s;s the means of &s;ecuring it. Never did a mini&s;ter depart more from the author's ideas of &s;implicity, or more em|barra&s;s the trade of America with the multiplicity and intricacy of regulations and ordinances, than his boa&s;ted mini&s;ter of 1764. That mini&s;ter &s;eem|ed
<PB N="106" REF="109">
to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;omething, hardly &s;hort of a rage, for regulation and re&s;triction. He had &s;o multiplied bonds, certificates, affidavits, warrants, &s;ufferances, and cockets; had &s;upported them with &s;uch &s;evere penalties, and extended them without the lea&s;t con&s;ideration of circum&s;tances to &s;o many objects, that, had they all continued in their origi|nal force, commerce mu&s;t &s;peedily have expired under them. Some of them, the mini&s;try which gave them birth was obliged to de&s;troy: with their own hand they &s;igned the condemnation of their own regulations; confe&s;&s;ing in &s;o many words, in the preamble of their act of the 5th Geo. III. that &s;ome of the&s;e regulations had laid <HI>an unnece&s;&s;ary re|&s;traint on the trade and corre&s;pondence of his Maje&s;ty's American &s;ubjects.</HI> This, in that mini&s;try, was a candid confe&s;&s;ion of a mi&s;take; but every altera|tion made in tho&s;e regulations by their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors is to be the effect of envy, and American mi&s;re|pre&s;entation. So much for the author's &s;implicity in regulation.</P>
<P>I HAVE now gone through all which I think im|mediately e&s;&s;ential in the author's ideas of war, of peace, of the comparative &s;tates of England and France, of our actual &s;ituation; in his projects of oeconomy, of finance, of commerce, and of con|&s;titutional improvement. There remains nothing now to be con&s;idered, except his heavy cen&s;ures upon the admini&s;tration which was formed in 1765; which is commonly known by the name of the marquis of Rockingham's admini&s;tration, as the admini&s;tration which preceded it is by that of Mr. Grenville. The&s;e cen&s;ures relate chiefly to three heads: 1. To the repeal of the American &s;tamp act. 2. To the commercial regulations then made. 3. To the cour&s;e of foreign negotiations during that &s;hort period.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="110">A PERSON who knew nothing of public affairs but from the writings of this author would be led to conclude, that, at the time of the change in June 1765, &s;ome well dige&s;ted &s;y&s;tem of admi|ni&s;tration, founded in national &s;trength, and in the affections of the people, proceeding in all points with the mo&s;t reverential and tender regard to the laws, and pur&s;uing with equal wi&s;dom and &s;ucce&s;s every thing which could tend to the in|ternal pro&s;perity, and to the external honour and dignity of this country, had been all at once &s;ub|verted, by an irruption of a &s;ort of wild, licen|tious, unprincipled invaders, who wantonly, and with a barbarous rage, had defaced a thou&s;and fair monuments of the con&s;titutional and political &s;kill of their predece&s;&s;ors. It is natural indeed that this author &s;hould have &s;ome di&s;like to the admi|ni&s;tration which was formed in 1765. Its views in mo&s;t things were different from tho&s;e of his friends; in &s;ome, altogether oppo&s;ite to them. It is impo&s;&s;ible that both of the&s;e admini&s;trations &s;hould be the objects of public e&s;teem. Their different principles compo&s;e &s;ome of the &s;tronge&s;t political lines which di&s;criminate the parties even now &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among&s;t us. The mini&s;ters of 1764 are not indeed followed by very many in their op|po&s;itions; yet a large part of the people now in office entertain, or pretend to entertain, &s;entiments entirely conformable to theirs; whil&s;t &s;ome of the former colleagues of the mini&s;try which was formed in 1765, however they may have abandoned the connexion, and contradicted by their conduct the principles of their former friends, pretend, on their parts, &s;till to adhere to the &s;ame maxims. All the le&s;&s;er divi&s;ions, which are indeed rather names of per&s;onal attachment than of party di&s;tinc|tion, fall in with the one or the other of the&s;e lead|ing parties.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="111">I INTEND to &s;tate, as &s;hortly as I am able, the general condition of public affairs, and the di&s;|po&s;ition of the minds of men, at the time of the re|markable change of &s;y&s;tem in 1765. The reader will have thereby a more di&s;tinct view of the com|parative merits of the&s;e &s;everal plans, and will re|ceive more &s;atisfaction concerning the ground and rea&s;on of the mea&s;ures which were then pur&s;ued, than, I believe, can be derived from the peru&s;al of tho&s;e partial repre&s;entations contained in The State of the Nation, and the other writings of tho&s;e who have continued, for now near three years, in the undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;s.

<P>ON the re&s;ignation of the earl of Bute, in 1763, our affairs had been delivered into the hands of three mini&s;ters of his recommendation; Mr. Gren|ville, the earl of Egremont, and the earl of Halifax. This arrangement, notwith&s;tanding the retirement of lord Bute, announced to the public a con|tinuance of the &s;ame mea&s;ures; nor was there more rea&s;on to expect a change from the death of the earl of Egremont. The earl of Sandwich &s;upplied his place. The duke of Bedford, and the gentlemen who acted in that connexion, and who&s;e general character and politics were &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, added to the &s;trength of the mini&s;try, without mak|ing any alteration in their plan of conduct. Such was the con&s;titution of the mini&s;try which was changed in 1765.</P>
<P>AS to their politics, the principles of the peace of Paris governed in foreign affairs. In dome&s;tic, the &s;ame &s;cheme prevailed, of contradicting the opi|nions, and di&s;gracing mo&s;t of the per&s;ons, who had been countenanced and employed in the late reign. The inclinations of the people were little attended
<PB N="109" REF="112">
to; and a di&s;po&s;ition to the u&s;e of forcible methods ran through the whole tenour of admini&s;tration. The nation in general was unea&s;y and di&s;&s;atisfied. Sober men &s;ay cau&s;es for it, in the con&s;titution of the mini&s;try and the conduct of the mini&s;ters. The mini&s;ters, who have u&s;ually a &s;hort method on &s;uch occa&s;ions, attributed their unpopularity wholly to the efforts of faction. However this might be, the licentiou&s;ne&s;s and tumults of the common people, and the contempt of government, of which our au|thor &s;o often and &s;o bitterly complains, as owing to the mi&s;management of the &s;ub&s;equent admini&s;tra|tions, had at no time ri&s;en to a greater or a more dangerous height. The mea&s;ures taken to &s;uppre&s;s that &s;pirit were as violent and licentious as the &s;pirit it&s;elf; injudicious, precipitate, and &s;ome of them illegal. In&s;tead of allaying, they tended infinitely to inflame the di&s;temper; and whoever will be at the lea&s;t pains to examine, will find tho&s;e mea&s;ures not only the cau&s;es of the tumults which then pre|vailed, but the real &s;ources of almo&s;t all the di&s;|orders which have ari&s;en &s;ince that time. More intent on making a victim to party than an ex|ample of ju&s;tice, they blundered in the method of pur&s;uing their vengeance. By this means a di&s;|covery was made of many practices, common in|deed in the office of &s;ecretary of &s;tate, but wholly repugnant to our laws, and the genius of the Eng|li&s;h con&s;titution. One of the wor&s;t of the&s;e was, the wanton and indi&s;criminate &s;eizure of papers, even in ca&s;es where the &s;afety of the &s;tate was not pretended in ju&s;tification of &s;o har&s;h a proceeding. The temper of the mini&s;try had excited a jealou&s;y, which made the people more than commonly vi|gilant concerning every power which was exerci&s;ed by government. The abu&s;e, however &s;anctioned by cu&s;tom, was evident; but the mini&s;try, in&s;tead of re&s;ting in a prudent inactivity, or (what would
<PB N="110" REF="113">
have been &s;till more prudent) taking the lead, in quieting the minds of the people, and a&s;certaining the law upon tho&s;e delicate points, made u&s;e of the whole influence of government to prevent a parlia|mentary re&s;olution again&s;t the&s;e practices of office. And le&s;t the colourable rea&s;ons, offered in argu|ment again&s;t this parliamentary procedure, &s;hould be mi&s;taken for the real motives of their conduct, all the advantage of privilege, all the arts and fine&s;&s;es of pleading, and great &s;ums of public mo|ney were lavi&s;hed, to prevent any deci&s;ion upon tho&s;e practices in the courts of ju&s;tice. In the mean time, in order to weaken, &s;ince they could not immediately de&s;troy, the liberty of the pre&s;s, the privilege of parliament was voted away in all accu|&s;ations for a &s;editious libel. The freedom of debate in parliament it&s;elf was no le&s;s menaced. Officers of the army, of long and meritorious &s;ervice, and of &s;mall fortunes, were cho&s;en as victims for a &s;in|gle vote, by an exertion of mini&s;terial power, which had been very rarely u&s;ed, and which is extremely unju&s;t, as depriving men not only of a place, but a profe&s;&s;ion, and is indeed of the mo&s;t pernicious ex|ample both in a civil and a military light.</P>
<P>WHILST all things were managed at home with &s;uch a &s;pirit of di&s;orderly de&s;poti&s;m; abroad there was a proportionable abatement of all &s;pirit. Some of our mo&s;t ju&s;t and valuable claims were in a man|ner abandoned. This indeed &s;eemed not very in|con&s;i&s;tent conduct in the mini&s;ters who had made the treaty of Paris. With regard to our dome&s;tic affairs, there was no want of indu&s;try; but there was a great deficiency of temper and judgment, and manly comprehen&s;ion of the public intere&s;t. The nation certainly wanted relief, and govern|ment attempted to admini&s;ter it. Two ways were principally cho&s;en for this great purpo&s;e. The
<PB N="111" REF="114">
fir&s;t by regulation; the &s;econd by new funds of re|venue. Agreeably to this plan, a new naval e&s;ta|bli&s;hment was formed at a good deal of expence, and to little effect, to aid in the collection of the cu&s;toms. Regulation was added to regulation; and the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t unre&s;erved orders were given, for a prevention of all contraband trade here, and in every part of America. A teazing cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and a multiplicity of perplexing regulations, ever have, and ever will appear, the ma&s;ter-piece of finance to people of narrow views; as a paper again&s;t &s;muggling, and the importation of French finery, never fails of furni&s;hing a very popular co|lumn in a news-paper.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of the&s;e regulations were made for America; and they fell &s;o indi&s;criminately on all &s;orts of contraband, or &s;uppo&s;ed contraband, that &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable branches of trade were driven violently from our ports; which cau&s;ed an univer&s;al con&s;ternation throughout the colonies. Every part of the trade was infinitely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by them. Men of war now for the fir&s;t time, armed with regular commi&s;&s;ions of cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers, inve&s;ted the coa&s;ts, and gave to the collection of revenue the air of ho&s;tile contribution. About the &s;ame time that the&s;e regulations &s;eemed to threaten the de&s;truction of the only trade from whence the plantations derived any &s;pecie, an act was made, putting a &s;top to the future emi&s;&s;ion of paper cur|rency, which u&s;ed to &s;upply its place among them. Hand in hand with this went another act, for oblig|ing the colonies to provide quarters for &s;oldiers. In&s;tantly followed another law, for levying through|out all America new port duties, upon a va&s;t va|riety of commodities of their con&s;umption, and &s;ome of which lay heavy upon objects nece&s;&s;ary for their trade and fi&s;hery. Immediately upon the
<PB N="112" REF="115">
heels of the&s;e, and amid&s;t the unea&s;ine&s;s and con|fu&s;ion produced by a crowd of new impo&s;itions and regulations, &s;ome good, &s;ome evil, &s;ome doubt|ful, all crude and ill-con&s;idered, came another act, for impo&s;ing an univer&s;al &s;tamp duty on the colo|nies; and this was declared to be little more than an experiment, and a foundation of future revenue. To render the&s;e proceedings the more irritating to the colonies, the principal argument u&s;ed in favour of their ability to pay &s;uch duties was the liberality of the grants of their a&s;&s;emblies during the late war. Never could any argument be more in&s;ult|ing and mortifying to a people habituated to the granting of their own money.</P>
<P>TAXES for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing revenue had hitherto been &s;paringly attempted in America. Without ever doubting the extent of its lawful power, parliament always doubted the propriety of &s;uch impo&s;itions. And the Americans on their part never thought of conte&s;ting a right by which they were &s;o little affected. Their a&s;&s;emblies in the main an&s;wered all the purpo&s;es nece&s;&s;ary to the internal oeconomy of a free people, and provided for all the exigencies of government which aro&s;e among&s;t them&s;elves. In the mid&s;t of that happy enjoyment, they never thought of critically &s;ettling the exact limits of a power, which was nece&s;&s;ary to their union, their &s;afety, their equality, and even their liberty. Thus the two very difficult points, &s;uperiority in the pre&s;iding &s;tate, and freedom in the &s;ubordinate, were on the whole &s;ufficiently, that is, practically, reconciled: without agitating tho&s;e vexatious que&s;tions, which in truth rather be|long to metaphy&s;ics than politics, and which can never be moved without &s;haking the foundations of the be&s;t governments that have ever been con&s;titut|ed by human wi&s;dom. By this mea&s;ure was let
<PB N="113" REF="116">
loo&s;e that dangerous &s;pirit of di&s;qui&s;ition, not in the coolne&s;s of philo&s;ophical enquiry, but enflamed with all the pa&s;&s;ions of an haughty re&s;entful people, who thought them&s;elves deeply injured, and that they were contending for every thing that was va|luable in the world.</P>
<P>IN England, our mini&s;ters went on without the lea&s;t attention to the&s;e alarming di&s;po&s;itions; ju&s;t as if they were doing the mo&s;t common things in the mo&s;t u&s;ual way, and among a people not only pa&s;&s;ive but plea&s;ed. They took no one &s;tep to divert the dangerous &s;pirit which began even then to appear in the colonies, to compromi&s;e with it, to mollify it, or to &s;ubdue it. No new arrangements were made in civil government; no new powers or in&s;tructions were given to governors; no aug|mentation was made, or new di&s;po&s;ition, of forces. Never was &s;o critical a mea&s;ure pur&s;ued with &s;o little provi&s;ion again&s;t its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences. As if all common prudence had abandoned the mini&s;ters, and as if they meant to plunge them|&s;elves and us headlong into that gulph which &s;tood gaping before them; by giving a year's notice of the project of their &s;tamp-act, they allowed time for all the di&s;contents of that country to fe&s;ter and come to a head, and for all the arrangements which factious men could make towards an oppo&s;ition to the law. At the &s;ame time they carefully con|cealed from the eye of parliament tho&s;e remon&s;tran|ces which they had actually received; and which in the &s;tronge&s;t manner indicated the di&s;content of &s;ome of the colonies, and the con&s;equences which might be expected; they concealed them, even in defiance of an order of council, that they &s;hould be laid before parliament. Thus, by concealing the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, they rendered the wi&s;dom of the nation as improvident as their own temerity,
<PB N="114" REF="117">
either in preventing or guarding again&s;t the mi&s;|chief. It has indeed, from the beginning to this hour, been the uniform policy of this &s;et of men, in order at any hazard to obtain a pre&s;ent credit, to propo&s;e whatever might be plea&s;ing, as attended with no difficulty; and afterwards to throw all the di&s;appointment of the wild expectations they had rai&s;ed, upon tho&s;e who have the hard ta&s;k of freeing the public from the con&s;equences of their pernicious projects.</P>
<P>WHILST the commerce and tranquillity of the whole empire were &s;haken in this manner, our af|fairs grew &s;till more di&s;tracted by the internal di&s;|&s;en&s;ions of our mini&s;ters. Treachery and ingrati|tude was charged from one &s;ide; de&s;poti&s;m and tyranny from the other; the vertigo of the regen|cy bill; the aukward reception of the &s;ilk bill in the hou&s;e of commons, and the incon&s;iderate and abrupt rejection of it in the hou&s;e of lords; the &s;trange and violent tumults which aro&s;e in con&s;e|quence, and which were rendered more &s;erious, by being charged by the mini&s;ters upon one another; the report of a gro&s;s and brutal treatment of the &mdash;, by a mini&s;try at the &s;ame time odious to the people; all con&s;pired to leave the public, at the clo&s;e of the &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1765, in as critical and pe|rilous a &s;ituation, as ever the nation was, or could be, in a time when &s;he was not immediately threat|ened by her neighbours.</P>
<P>IT was at this time, and in the&s;e circum&s;tances, that a new admini&s;tration was formed. Profe&s;&s;ing even indu&s;triou&s;ly, in this public matter, to avoid anecdotes; I &s;ay nothing of tho&s;e famous reconci|liations and quarrels, which weakened the body that &s;hould have been the natural &s;upport of this admini&s;tration. I run no ri&s;k in affirming, that, &s;urrounded as they were with difficulties of every
<PB N="115" REF="118">
&s;pecies, nothing but the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t uncor|rupt &s;en&s;e of their duty to the public could have prevailed upon &s;ome of the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed it to undertake the king's bu&s;ine&s;s at &s;uch a time. Their preceding character, their mea&s;ures while in power, and the &s;ub&s;equent conduct of many of them, I think, leave no room to charge this a&s;&s;er|tion to flattery. Having undertaken the common|wealth, what remained for them to do? to piece their conduct upon the broken chain of former mea&s;ures? If they had been &s;o inclined, the ruin|ous nature of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which began in&s;tantly to appear would not have permitted it. Scarcely had they entered into office, when letters arrived from all parts of America, making loud complaints, backed by &s;trong rea&s;ons, again&s;t &s;everal of the principal regulations of the late mini&s;try, as threat|ening de&s;truction to many valuable branches of commerce. The&s;e were attended with repre&s;enta|tions from many merchants and capital manufactur|ers at home, who had all their intere&s;ts involved in the &s;upport of lawful trade, and in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of every &s;ort of contraband. Whil&s;t the&s;e things were under con&s;ideration, that conflagration blaz|ed out at once in North America, an univer&s;al di&s;|obedience, and open re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;tamp act; and, in con&s;equence, an univer&s;al &s;top to the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, and to trade and navigation, throughout that great important country; an interval during which the trading intere&s;t of England lay under the mo&s;t dreadful anxiety which it ever felt.</P>
<P>THE repeal of that act was propo&s;ed. It was much too &s;erious a mea&s;ure, and attended with too many difficulties upon every &s;ide, for the then mi|ni&s;try to have undertaken it, as &s;ome paltry writers have a&s;&s;erted, from envy and di&s;like to their pre|dece&s;&s;ors in office. As little could it be owing to
<PB N="116" REF="119">
per&s;onal cowardice, and dread of con&s;equences to them&s;elves. Mini&s;ters, timorous from their attach|ment to place and power, will fear more from the con&s;equences of one court intrigue, than from a thou&s;and difficulties to the commerce and credit of their country by di&s;turbances at three thou&s;and miles di&s;tance. From which of the&s;e the mini&s;ters had mo&s;t to apprehend at that time, is known, I pre&s;ume, univer&s;ally. Nor did they take that re|&s;olution from a want of the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the in|conveniencies which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend a mea|&s;ure of conce&s;&s;ion from the &s;overeign to the &s;ubject. That it mu&s;t increa&s;e the in&s;olence of the mutinous &s;pirits in America, was but too obvious. No great mea&s;ure indeed, at a very difficult cri&s;is, can be pur|&s;ued, which is not attended with &s;ome mi&s;chief; none but conceited pretenders in public bu&s;ine&s;s will hold any other language: and none but weak and unexperienced men will believe them, if they &s;hould. If we were found in &s;uch a cri&s;is, let tho&s;e who&s;e bold de&s;igns, and who&s;e defective arrange|ments, brought us into it, an&s;wer for the con&s;e|quences. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the then mini&s;try evi|dently was, to take &s;uch &s;teps, not as the wi&s;hes of our author, or as their own wi&s;hes dictated, but as the bad &s;ituation in which their predece&s;&s;ors had left them ab&s;olutely required.</P>
<P>THE di&s;obedience to this act was univer&s;al throughout America; nothing, it was evident, but the &s;ending a very &s;trong military, backed by a very &s;trong naval force, would reduce the &s;editious to obedience. To &s;end it to one town, would not be &s;ufficient; every province of America mu&s;t be traver&s;ed, and mu&s;t be &s;ubdued. I do not enter|tain the lea&s;t doubt but this could be done. We might, I think, without much difficulty have de|&s;troyed our colonies. This de&s;truction might be
<PB N="117" REF="120">
effected, probably in a year, or in two at the ut|mo&s;t. If the que&s;tion was upon a foreign nation, where every &s;ucce&s;sful &s;troke adds to your own power, and takes from that of a rival, a ju&s;t war with &s;uch a certain &s;uperiority would be undoubt|edly an advi&s;able mea&s;ure. But <HI>four million</HI> of debt due to our merchants, the total ce&s;&s;ation of a trade annually worth <HI>four million</HI> more, a large foreign traffic, much home manufacture, a very capital immediate revenue ari&s;ing from colony imports, indeed the produce of every one of our revenues greatly depending on this trade, all the&s;e were very weighty accumulated con&s;iderations, at lea&s;t well to be weighed, before that &s;word was drawn, which even by its victories mu&s;t produce all the evil effects of the greate&s;t national defeat. How public credit mu&s;t have &s;uffered, I need not &s;ay. If the conditi|on of the nation, at the clo&s;e of our foreign war, was what this author repre&s;ents it, &s;uch a civil war would have been a bad couch on which to repo&s;e our wearied virtue. Far from being able to have entered into new plans of oeconomy, we mu&s;t have launched into a new &s;ea, I fear a boundle&s;s &s;ea, of expence. Such an addition of debt, with &s;uch a diminution of revenue and trade, would have left us in no want of a <HI>State of the nation</HI> to aggravate the picture of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>OUR trade felt this to its vitals: and our then mi|ni&s;ters were not a&s;hamed to &s;ay, that they &s;ympa|thized with the feelings of our merchants. The univer&s;al alarm of the whole trading body of Eng|land will never be laughed at by them as an ill-grounded or a pretended panic. The univer&s;al de&s;ire of that body will always have great weight with them in every con&s;ideration connected with commerce; neither ought the opinion of that body to be &s;lighted (notwith&s;tanding the contemptuous
<PB N="118" REF="121">
and indecent language of this author and his a&s;&s;o|ciates) in any con&s;ideration what&s;oever of revenue. Nothing among&s;t us is more quickly or deeply af|fected by taxes of any kind than trade; and if an American tax was a real relief to England, no part of the community would be &s;ooner, or more mate|rially, relieved by it than our merchants. But they well know that the trade of England mu&s;t be more burthened by one penny rai&s;ed in America, than by three in England; and if that penny be rai&s;ed with the unea&s;ine&s;s, the di&s;content, and the confu|&s;ion of America, more than by ten.</P>
<P>IF the opinion and wi&s;h of the landed intere&s;t is a motive, and it is a fair and ju&s;t one, for taking away a real and large revenue, the de&s;ire of the trading intere&s;t of England ought to be a ju&s;t ground for taking away a tax, of little better than &s;peculation, which was to be collected by a war, which was to be kept up with the perpetual di&s;con|tent of tho&s;e who were to be affected by it, and the value of who&s;e produce, even after the <HI>ordinary</HI> charges of collection, was very uncertain<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">It is ob&s;ervable, that the partizans of American taxation, when they have a mind to repre&s;ent this tax as wonderfully be|neficial to England, &s;tate it as worth &pound;. 100000 a year; when they are to repre&s;ent it as very light on the Americans, it dwin|dles to &pound;. 60.000. Indeed it is very difficult to compute what its produce might have been.</NOTE>; after the <HI>extraordinary,</HI> the deare&s;t purcha&s;ed revenue that ever was made by any nation.</P>
<P>THESE were &s;ome of the motives drawn from principles of convenience for that repeal. When the object came to be more narrowly in&s;pected, every motive concurred. The&s;e colonies were evi|dently founded in &s;ub&s;ervience to the commerce of Great Britain. From this principle, the whole &s;y&s;tem of our laws concerning them became a &s;y&s;|tem
<PB N="119" REF="122">
of re&s;triction. A double monopoly was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on the part of the parent country; 1. a mo|nopoly of their whole import, which is to be altoge|ther from Great Britain; 2. a monopoly of all their export, which is to be no where but to Great Bri|tain, as far as it can &s;erve any purpo&s;e here. On the &s;ame idea it was contrived that they &s;hould &s;end all their products to us raw, and in their fir&s;t &s;tate; and that they &s;hould take every thing from us in the la&s;t &s;tage of manufacture.</P>
<P>WERE ever a people under &s;uch circum&s;tances, that is, a people who were to export raw, and to receive manufactured, and this, not a few luxuri|ous articles, but all articles, even to tho&s;e of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t, mo&s;t vulgar, and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;umption, a people who were in the hands of a general mono|poli&s;t, were ever &s;uch a people &s;u&s;pected of a po&s;&s;i|bility of becoming a ju&s;t object of revenue? All the ends of their foundation mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed utter|ly contradicted before they could become &s;uch an object.

<P>THE partizans of the new &s;y&s;tem, who, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, take credit for full as much knowledge as they po&s;&s;e&s;s, think proper on this occa&s;ion to counterfeit an extraordinary degree of ignorance, and in con&s;equence of it to a&s;&s;ert,

I &s;hall be ready to admit that the colonies ought to be taxed to the revenues of this country, when I know that they are out of debt to its commerce. This author will furni&s;h &s;ome ground to his theories, and commu|nicate a di&s;covery to the public, if he can &s;hew this by any medium.

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"their &s;eas are covered with &s;hips, and their rivers floating with commerce."</Q>
This is true. But it is with <HI>our</HI> &s;hips that the&s;e &s;eas are covered; and their rivers float with Briti&s;h commerce. The American merchants are our factors; all in reality, mo&s;t even in name. The Americans trade, navigate, cultivate, with Engli&s;h capitals; to their own ad|vantage, to be &s;ure; for without the&s;e capitals their ploughs would be &s;topped, and their &s;hips wind-bound. But he who furni&s;hes the capital mu&s;t, on the whole, be the per&s;on principally be|nefited; the per&s;on who works upon it profits on his part too; but he profits in a &s;ubordinate way, as our colonies do; that is, as the &s;ervant of a wi&s;e and indulgent ma&s;ter, and no otherwi&s;e. We have all, except the <HI>peculium</HI>; without which, even &s;laves will not labour.</P>
<P>IF the author's principles, which are the common notions, be right, that the price of our manufac|tures is &s;o greatly enhanced by our taxes; then the Americans already pay in that way a &s;hare of our impo&s;itions. He is not a&s;hamed to a&s;&s;ert, that

To &s;ecure to us, not a commercial preference, which &s;tands in need of no penalties to enforce it; it finds its own way; but to &s;ecure to us a trade, which is a creature of law and in&s;titution.

None but the au|thors of &s;uch mea&s;ures could ever think of making u&s;e of &s;uch arguments.</P>
<P>WHOEVER goes about to rea&s;on on any part of the policy of this country with regard to America, upon the mere ab&s;tract principles of government, or even upon tho&s;e of our own antient con&s;titution, will be often mi&s;led. Tho&s;e who re&s;ort for argu|ments to the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authorities, antient or modern, or re&s;t upon the cleare&s;t maxims, drawn from the experience of other &s;tates and empires, will be liable to the greate&s;t errors imaginable. The object is wholly new in the world. It is &s;in|gular: it is grown up to this magnitude and im|portance within the memory of man; nothing in hi&s;tory is parallel to it. All the rea&s;onings about it, that are likely to be at all &s;olid, mu&s;t be drawn from its actual circum&s;tances. In this new &s;y&s;tem a principle of commerce, of artificial commerce, mu&s;t predominate. This commerce mu&s;t be &s;e|cured by a multitude of re&s;traints very alien from the &s;pirit of liberty; and a powerful authority mu&s;t
<PB N="122" REF="125">
re&s;ide in the principal &s;tate, in order to enforce them. But the people who are to be &s;ubjects of the&s;e re&s;traints are de&s;cendants of Engli&s;hmen; and of an high and free &s;pirit. To hold over them a government made up of nothing but re&s;traints and penalties, and taxes in the granting of which they can have no &s;hare, will neither be wi&s;e, nor long practicable. People mu&s;t be governed in a manner agreeable to their temper and di&s;po&s;ition; and men of free character and &s;pirit mu&s;t be ruled with, at lea&s;t, &s;ome conde&s;cen&s;ion to this &s;pirit and this character.

<P>THOSE rea&s;onings, which infer from the many re&s;traints under which we have already laid Ame|rica, to our right to lay it under &s;till more, and in|deed under all manner of re&s;traints, are conclu|&s;ive; conclu&s;ive as to right; but the very rever&s;e as to policy and practice. We ought rather to infer from our having laid the colonies under many re|&s;traints, that it is rea&s;onable to compen&s;ate them by every indulgence that can by any means be re|conciled to our intere&s;t. We have a great empire to rule, compo&s;ed of a va&s;t ma&s;s of heterogeneous governments, all more or le&s;s free and popular in their forms, all to be kept in peace, and kept out of con&s;piracy, with one another, all to be held in &s;ubordination to this country; while the &s;pirit of an exten&s;ive and intricate trading intere&s;t pervades the whole, always qualifying, and often controlling, every general idea of con&s;titution and government. It is a great and difficult object; and I wi&s;h we may po&s;&s;e&s;s wi&s;dom and temper enough to manage it as we ought. Its importance is infinite. I be|lieve the reader will be &s;truck, as I have been, with one &s;ingular fact. In the year 1704, but &s;ixty-five

<P>FROM the &s;ame information I find that our deal|ing with mo&s;t of the European nations is but little encrea&s;ed; the&s;e nations have been pretty much at a &s;tand &s;ince that time; and we have rivals in their trade. This colony intercour&s;e is a new world of commerce in a manner created; it &s;tands upon principles of its own; principles hardly worth endangering for any little con&s;ideration of extorted revenue.</P>
<P>THE reader &s;ees, that I do not enter &s;o fully into this matter as obviou&s;ly I might. I have already been led into greater lengths than I in|tended. It is enough to &s;ay, that, before the mi|ni&s;ters of 1765 had determined to propo&s;e the repeal of the &s;tamp act in parliament, they had the whole of the American con&s;titution and commerce very fully before them. They con&s;idered maturely; they decided with wi&s;dom; let me add, with firm|ne&s;s. For they re&s;olved, as a preliminary to that repeal, to a&s;&s;ert in the fulle&s;t and lea&s;t equivocal terms the unlimited legi&s;lative right of this country over its colonies; and, having done this, to pro|po&s;e the repeal, on principles, not of con&s;titutional right, but on tho&s;e of expediency, of equity, of lenity, and of the true intere&s;ts pre&s;ent and future
<PB N="124" REF="127">
of that great object for which alone the colonies were founded, navigation and commerce. This plan, I &s;ay, required an uncommon degree of firmne&s;s, when we con&s;ider that &s;ome of tho&s;e per|&s;ons who might be of the greate&s;t u&s;e in promoting the repeal, violently with&s;tood the declaratory act; and they who agreed with admini&s;tration in the principles of that law, equally made, as well the rea&s;ons on which the declaratory act it&s;elf &s;tood, as tho&s;e on which it was oppo&s;ed, grounds for an op|po&s;ition to the repeal.</P>
<P>IF the then mini&s;try re&s;olved fir&s;t to declare the right, it was not from any opinion they enter|tained of its future u&s;e in regular taxation. Their opinions were full and declared again&s;t the ordinary u&s;e of &s;uch a power. But it was plain, that the general rea&s;onings which were employed again&s;t that power went directly to our whole legi&s;lative right; and one part of it could not be yielded to &s;uch arguments, without a virtual &s;urrender of all the re&s;t. Be&s;ides, if that very &s;pecific power of levying money in the colonies were not retained as a &s;acred tru&s;t in the hands of Great Britain (to be u&s;ed, not in the fir&s;t in&s;tance for &s;upply, but in the la&s;t exigence for controul), it is obvious, that the pre&s;iding authority of Great Britain, as the head, the arbiter, and director of the whole em|pire, would vani&s;h into an empty name, without operation or energy. With the habitual exerci&s;e of &s;uch a power in the ordinary cour&s;e of &s;upply, no trace of freedom could remain to America.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">I do not here enter into the un&s;atisfactory di&s;qui&s;ition con|cerning repre&s;entation real or pre&s;umed. I only &s;ay, that a great people, who have their property, without any re&s;erve, in all ca&s;es, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;po&s;ed of by another people at an immen&s;e di&s;tance from them, will not think them&s;elves in the enjoyment of freedom. It will be hard to &s;hew to tho&s;e who are in &s;uch a &s;tate, which of the u&s;ual parts of the definition or de&s;cription of a free people are applicable to them; and it is neither plea|&s;ant nor wi&s;e to attempt to prove that they have no right to be comprehended in &s;uch a de&s;cription.</NOTE> If
<PB N="125" REF="128">
Great Britain were &s;tripped of this right, every principle of unity and &s;ubordination in the empire was gone for ever. Whether all this can be re|conciled in legal &s;peculation, is a matter of no con&s;equence. It is reconciled in policy; and poli|tics ought to be adju&s;ted, not to human rea&s;onings, but to human nature; of which the rea&s;on is but a part, and by no means the greate&s;t part.</P>
<P>FOUNDING the repeal on this ba&s;is, it was judg|ed proper to lay before parliament the whole detail of the American affairs, as fully as it had been laid before the mini&s;try them&s;elves. Ignorance of tho&s;e affairs had mi&s;led parliament. Knowledge alone could bring it into the right road. Every paper of office was laid upon the table of the two hou&s;es; every denomination of men, either of America, or connected with it by office, by re&s;idence, by com|merce, by intere&s;t, even by injury; men of civil and military capacity, officers of the revenue, merchants, manufacturers of every &s;pecies, and from every town in England, attended at the bar. Such evidence never was laid before parliament. If an emulation aro&s;e among the mini&s;ters and members of parliament, as the author rightly ob|&s;erves,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P. 21.</NOTE> for the repeal of this act, as well as for the other regulations, it was not on the confident a&s;&s;ertions, the airy &s;peculations, or the vain pro|mi&s;es, of mini&s;ters, that it aro&s;e. It was the &s;en&s;e of parliament on the evidence before them. No one &s;o much as &s;u&s;pects that mini&s;terial allurements or terrors had any &s;hare in it.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129">OUR author is very much di&s;plea&s;ed, that &s;o much credit was given to the te&s;timony of mer|chants. He has an habit of railing at them; and he may, if he plea&s;es, indulge him&s;elf in it. It will not do great mi&s;chief to that re&s;pectable &s;et of men. The &s;ub&s;tance of their te&s;timony was, that their debts in America were very great: That the Americans declined to pay them, or to renew their orders, whil&s;t this act continued: That, under the&s;e circum&s;tances, they de&s;paired of the recovery of their debts, or the renewal of their trade in that country: That they apprehended a general failure of mercantile credit. The manufacturers depo&s;ed to the &s;ame general purpo&s;e, with this addition, that many of them had di&s;charged &s;everal of their artificers; and, if the law and the re&s;i&s;tance to it &s;hould continue, mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s them all.</P>
<P>THIS te&s;timony is treated with great contempt by our author. It mu&s;t be, I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e it was contradicted by the plain nature of things. Suppo&s;e then that the merchants had, to gratify this author, given a contrary evidence; and had depo&s;ed, that while America remained in a &s;tate of re&s;i&s;tance, whil&s;t four million of debt remained un|paid, whil&s;t the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice was &s;u&s;pended for want of &s;tamp paper, &s;o that no debt could be re|covered, whil&s;t there was a total &s;top to trade, be|cau&s;e every &s;hip was &s;ubject to &s;eizure for want of &s;tamped clearances, and while the colonies were to be declared in rebellion, and &s;ubdued by armed force, that in the&s;e circum&s;tances they would &s;till continue to trade chearfully and fearle&s;sly as before; would not &s;uch witne&s;&s;es provoke univer&s;al indig|nation for their folly or their wickedne&s;s, and be de|&s;ervedly hooted from the bar<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Here the author has a note altogether in his u&s;ual &s;train of rea&s;oning; he finds out that &s;omebody, in the cour&s;e of this multifarious evidence, had &s;aid,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that a very con&s;iderable part of the orders of 1765 tran&s;mitted from America had been af|terwards &s;u&s;pended; but that, in ca&s;e the &s;tamp act was re|pealed, tho&s;e orders were to be executed in the pre&s;ent year 1766;"</Q>
and that on the repeal of the &s;tamp act,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the ex|ports to the colonies would be at lea&s;t double the value of the exports of the pa&s;t year."</Q>
He then triumphs exceedingly on their having fallen &s;hort of it on the &s;tate of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e entries. I do not well know what conclu&s;ion he draws applicable to his purpo&s;e, from the&s;e facts. He does not deny that all the orders which came from America &s;ub&s;equent to the di&s;turbances of the &s;tamp act were on the condition of that act being repealed; and he does not a&s;&s;ert that, notwith&s;tanding that act &s;hould be enforced by a &s;trong hand, &s;till the orders would be executed. Neither does he quite venture to &s;ay that this decline of the trade in 1766 was owing to the repeal. What does he therefore infer from it, favourable to the en|forcement of that law? It only comes to this, and no more; tho&s;e merchants, who thought our trade would be doubled in the &s;ub&s;equent year, were mi&s;taken in their &s;peculations. So that the &s;tamp act was not to be repealed unle&s;s this &s;peculation of theirs was a probable event. But it was not repealed in order to double our trade in that year, as every body knows (what|ever &s;ome merchants might have &s;aid), but le&s;t in that year we &s;hould have no trade at all. The fact is, that, during the greate&s;t part of the year 1765, that is, until about the month of October, when the accounts of the di&s;turbances came thick upon us, the American trade went on as u&s;ual. Before this time, the &s;tamp act could not affect it. Afterwards, the mer|chants fell into a great con&s;ternation; a general &s;tagnation in trade en&s;ued. But as &s;oon as it was known that the mini&s;try favoured the repeal of the &s;tamp act, &s;everal of the bolder mer|chants ventured to execute their orders; others more timid hung back; in this manner the trade continued in a &s;tate of dreadful fluctuation between the fears of tho&s;e who had ven|tured, for the event of their boldne&s;s, and the anxiety of tho&s;e who&s;e trade was &s;u&s;pended, until the royal a&s;&s;ent was finally given to the bill of repeal. That the trade of 1766 was not equal to that of 1765, could not be owing to the repeal; it aro&s;e from quite different cau&s;es, of which the author &s;eems not to be aware: 1&s;t, Our conque&s;ts during the war had laid open the trade of the French and Spani&s;h We&s;t Indies to our colonies much more largely than they had ever enjoyed it; this continued for &s;ome time after the peace; but at length it was extremely contracted, and in &s;ome places reduced to nothing. Such in particular was the &s;tate of Jamaica. On the taking the Havannah all the &s;tores of that i&s;land were emptied into that place, which produced unu&s;ual orders for goods, for &s;upplying their own con&s;umption, as well as for further &s;peculations of trade. The&s;e cea&s;ing, the trade &s;tood on its own bottom. This is one cau&s;e of the dimini&s;hed exports to Jamaica; and not the childi&s;h idea of the author, of an impo&s;&s;ible contraband from the opening of the ports. 2d, The war had brought a great influx of ca&s;h into America, for the pay and provi&s;ion of the troops; and this an unnatural encrea&s;e of trade; which, as its cau&s;e failed, mu&s;t in &s;ome degree return to its ancient and na|tural bounds. 3d, When the merchants met from all parts, and compared their accounts, they were alarmed at the im|men&s;ity of the debt due to them from America. They found that the Americans had over traded their abilities. And, as they found too that &s;everal of them were capable of making the &s;tate of political events an excu&s;e for their failure in commercial punctuality, many of our merchants in &s;ome degree contracted their trade from that moment. However, it is idle, in &s;uch an immen&s;e ma&s;s of trade, &s;o liable to fluctuation, to infer any thing from &s;uch a deficiency as one or even as two hundred thou&s;and pounds. In 1767, when the di&s;turbances &s;ub&s;ided, this deficiency was made up again.</P></NOTE>; would any human

faith have given credit to &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions? The te&s;ti|mony of the merchants was nece&s;&s;ary for the detail,
<PB N="128" REF="131">
and to bring the matter home to the feeling of the hou&s;e; as to the general rea&s;ons, they &s;poke abun|dantly for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e principles was the act repealed, and it produced all the good effect which was expected from it: quiet was re&s;tored; trade generally re|turned to its antient channels; time and means were furni&s;hed for the better &s;trengthening of government there, as well as for recovering, by judicious mea&s;ures, the affections of the people, had that mini&s;try continued, or had a mini&s;try &s;uc|ceeded with di&s;po&s;itions to improve that opportu|nity.</P>
<P>SUCH an admini&s;tration did not &s;ucceed. In&s;tead of profiting of that &s;ea&s;on of tranquillity, in the very next year they cho&s;e to return to mea&s;ures of the

very &s;ame nature with tho&s;e which had been &s;o &s;o|lemnly condemned; though upon a &s;maller &s;cale. The effects have been corre&s;pondent. America is again in di&s;order; not indeed in the &s;ame degree as formerly, nor any thing like it. Such good effects have attended the repeal of the &s;tamp act, that the colonies have actually paid the taxes; and they have &s;ought their redre&s;s (upon however improper principles) not in their own violence, as formerly<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The di&s;turbances have been in Bo&s;ton only; and were not in con&s;equence of the late duties.</NOTE>; but in the experienced benignity of parliament. They are not ea&s;y indeed, nor ever will be &s;o, un|der this author's &s;cheme of taxation; but we &s;ee no longer the &s;ame general fury and confu&s;ion, which attended their re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;tamp act. The au|thor may rail at the repeal, and tho&s;e who propo&s;ed it, as he plea&s;es. Tho&s;e hone&s;t men &s;uffer all his obloquy with plea&s;ure, in the mid&s;t of the quiet which they have been the means of giving to their country; and would think his prai&s;es for their per|&s;everance in a pernicious &s;cheme, a very bad com|pen&s;ation for the di&s;turbance of our peace, and the ruin of our commerce. Whether the return to the &s;y&s;tem of 1764, for rai&s;ing a revenue in America, the di&s;contents which have en&s;ued in con&s;equence of it, the general &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the a&s;&s;emblies in con|&s;equence of the&s;e di&s;contents, the u&s;e of the military power, and the new and dangerous commi&s;&s;ions which now hang over them, will produce equally good effects, is greatly to be doubted. Never, I fear, will this nation and the colonies fall back upon their true centre of gravity, and natural point of repo&s;e, until the ideas of 1766 are re&s;umed, and &s;teadily pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>AS to the regulations, a great &s;ubject of the author's accu&s;ation, they are of two &s;orts; one of a mixed nature, of revenue and trade; the other
<PB N="130" REF="133">
&s;imply relative to trade. With regard to the for|mer I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that, in all deliberations con|cerning America, the ideas of that admini&s;tration were principally the&s;e; to take trade as the primary end, and revenue but as a very &s;ubordinate con|&s;ideration. Where trade was likely to &s;uffer, they did not he&s;itate for an in&s;tant to prefer it to taxes, who&s;e produce at be&s;t was contemptible, in compa|ri&s;on of the object which they might endanger. The other of their principles was, to &s;uit the revenue to the object. Where the difficulty of collection, from the nature of the country, and of the revenue e&s;ta|bli&s;hment, is &s;o very notorious, it was their policy to hold out as few temptations to &s;muggling as po&s;|&s;ible, by keeping the duties as nearly as they could on a balance with the ri&s;k. On the&s;e principles they made many alterations in the port duties of 1764, both in the mode and in the quantity. The author has not attempted to prove them erroneous. He complains enough to &s;hew that he is in an ill humour, not that his adver&s;aries have done ami&s;s.</P>
<P>AS to the regulations which were merely rela|tive to commerce, many were then made; and they were all made upon this principle; that many of the colonies, and tho&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t abounding in people, were &s;o &s;ituated as to have very few means of traffic with this country. It became therefore our intere&s;t to let them into as much fo|reign trade as could be given them without inter|fering with our own; and to &s;ecure by every me|thod the returns to the mother country. Without &s;ome &s;uch &s;cheme of enlargement, it was obvious that any benefit we could expect from the&s;e colo|nies mu&s;t be extremely limited. Accordingly many facilities were given to their trade with the foreign plantations, and with the Southern parts of Europe.
<PB N="131" REF="134">
As to the confining the returns to this country, ad|mini&s;tration &s;aw the mi&s;chief and folly of a plan of indi&s;criminate re&s;traint. They applied their remedy to that part where the di&s;ea&s;e exi&s;ted, and to that only; on this idea they e&s;tabli&s;hed regulations, far more likely to check the dangerous clande&s;tine trade with Hamburgh and Holland, than this au|thor's friends, or any of their predece&s;&s;ors, had ever done.</P>
<P>THE friends of the author have a method &s;urely a little whim&s;ical in all this &s;ort of di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. They have made an innumerable multitude of com|mercial regulations, at which the trade of England exclaimed with one voice, and many of which have been altered on the unanimous opinion of that trade. Still they go on, ju&s;t as before, in a &s;ort of droning panegyric on them&s;elves, talking of the&s;e regulations as prodigies of wi&s;dom; and, in|&s;tead of appealing to tho&s;e who are mo&s;t affected and the be&s;t judges, they turn round in a perpetual circle of their own rea&s;onings and pretences; they hand you over from one of their pamphlets to ano|ther: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"See," &s;ay they,

I wi&s;h to take another method in vindicating the oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tem. I refer to the petitions of merchants for the&s;e regulations; to their thanks when they were obtained; and to the &s;trong and grateful &s;en&s;e they have ever &s;ince expre&s;&s;ed of the benefits received under that admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>ALL admini&s;trations have in their commercial re|gulations been generally aided by the opinion of &s;ome merchants; too frequently by that of a few, and tho&s;e a &s;ort of favourites: they have been di|rected by the opinion of one or two merchants, who
<PB N="132" REF="135">
were to merit in flatteries, and to be paid in con|tracts; who frequently advi&s;ed, not for the general good of trade, but for their private advantage. During the admini&s;tration of which this author com|plains, the meetings of merchants upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of trade were numerous and public; &s;ometimes at the hou&s;e of the marquis of Rockingham; &s;ome|times at Mr. Dowde&s;well's; &s;ometimes at &s;ir George Savile's, an hou&s;e always open to every deliberation favourable to the liberty or the commerce of his country. Nor were the&s;e meetings confined to the merchants of London. Merchants and manufac|turers were invited from all the con&s;iderable towns of England. They conferred with the mini&s;ters and active members of parliament. No private views, no local intere&s;ts prevailed. Never were points in trade &s;ettled upon a larger &s;cale of information. They who attended the&s;e meetings well know, what mini&s;ters they were who heard the mo&s;t pa|tiently, who comprehended the mo&s;t clearly, and who provided the mo&s;t wi&s;ely. Let then this author and his friends &s;till continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the practice of exalting their own abilities, in their pamphlets and in the news-papers. They never will per&s;wade the public, that the merchants of England were in a general confederacy to &s;acrifice their own intere&s;ts to tho&s;e of North America, and to de&s;troy the vent of their own goods in favour of the manufactures of France and Holland.</P>
<P>HAD the friends of this author taken the&s;e means of information, his extreme terrors of contraband in the We&s;t India i&s;lands would have been greatly quieted, and his objections to the opening of the ports would have cea&s;ed. He would have learned, from the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory analy&s;is of the We&s;t India trade, that we have the advantage in every e&s;&s;ential
<PB N="133" REF="136">
article of it; and that almo&s;t every re&s;triction on our communication with our neighbours there, is a re&s;triction unfavourable to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>SUCH were the principles that guided, and the authority that &s;anctioned, the&s;e regulations. No man ever &s;aid, that, in the multiplicity of regulations made in the admini&s;tration of their predece&s;&s;ors, none were u&s;eful: &s;ome certainly were &s;o; and I defy the author to &s;hew a commercial regulation of that period, which he can prove, from any autho|rity except his own, to have a tendency beneficial to commerce, that has been repealed. So far were that mini&s;try from being guided by a &s;pirit of con|tradiction or of innovation.</P>
<P>THE author's attack on that admini&s;tration, for their neglect of our claims on foreign powers, is by much the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tance he has given, or that, I believe, any man ever did give, of an in|trepid effrontery. It relates to the Manilla ran&s;om; to the Canada bills; and to the Ru&s;&s;ian treaty. Could one imagine, that the&s;e very things, which he thus choo&s;es to object to others, have been the principal &s;ubjects of charge again&s;t his favourite mini&s;try? In&s;tead of clearing them of the&s;e charges, he appears not &s;o much as to have heard of them; but throws them directly upon the admini&s;tration which &s;ucceeded to that of his friends.</P>
<P>IT is not always very plea&s;ant to be obliged to produce the detail of this kind of tran&s;actions to the public view. I will content my&s;elf therefore with giving a &s;hort &s;tate of facts, which, when the author choo&s;es to contradict, he &s;hall &s;ee proved, more, perhaps, to his conviction, than to his liking. The fir&s;t fact then is, that the demand for the Manilla ran&s;om had been, in the author's favourite admini|&s;tration, &s;o neglected, as to appear to have been
<PB N="134" REF="137">
little le&s;s than tacitly abandoned. At home, no countenance was given to the claimants; and when it was mentioned in parliament, the then leader did not &s;eem, at lea&s;t, <HI>a very &s;anguine advocate in fa|vour of the claim.</HI> The&s;e things made it a matter of no &s;mall difficulty to re&s;ume and pre&s;s that negoti|ation with Spain. However, &s;o clear was our right, that the then mini&s;ters re&s;olved to revive it; and &s;o little time was lo&s;t, that, though that admini&s;tration was not compleated until the ninth of July 1765, on the 20th of the following Augu&s;t, general Con|way tran&s;mitted a &s;trong and full remon&s;trance on that &s;ubject to the earl of Rochfort. The argument, on which the court of Madrid mo&s;t relied, was the dereliction of that claim by the preceding mini&s;ters. However, it was &s;till pu&s;hed with &s;o much vigour, that the Spaniards, from a po&s;itive denial to pay, of|fered to refer the demand to arbitration. That propo&s;ition was rejected; and the demand being &s;till pre&s;&s;ed, there was all the rea&s;on in the world to expect its being brought to a favourable i&s;&s;ue; when it was thought proper to change the admini|&s;tration. Whether under their circum&s;tances, and in the time they continued in power, more could be done, the reader will judge; who will hear with a&s;toni&s;hment a charge of remi&s;&s;ne&s;s from tho&s;e very men, who&s;e inactivity, to call it by no wor&s;e a name, laid the chief difficulties in the way of the re|vived negotiation.</P>
<P>As to the Canada bills, this author thinks proper to a&s;&s;ert,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P. 24.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the proprietors found them&s;elves under a nece&s;&s;ity of compounding their demands upon the French court, and accepting terms which they had often rejected, and which the earl of Halifax had declared he would &s;ooner forfeit his hand than &s;ign."</Q>
When I know that
<PB N="135" REF="138">
the earl of Halifax &s;ays &s;o, the earl of Halifax &s;hall have an an&s;wer; but I per&s;wade my&s;elf that his lord&s;hip has given no authority for this ridiculous rant. In the mean time, I &s;hall only &s;peak of it as a common concern of that mini&s;try.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place then I ob&s;erve, that a conventi|on, for the liquidation of the Canada bills, was con|cluded under the admini&s;tration of 1766; when nothing was concluded under that of the favourites of this author.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS tran&s;action was, in every &s;tep of it, car|ried on in concert with the per&s;ons intere&s;ted, and was terminated to their entire &s;atisfaction. They would have acquie&s;ced perhaps in terms &s;omewhat lower than tho&s;e which were obtained. The author is indeed too kind to them. He will, however, let them &s;peak for them&s;elves, and &s;hew what their own opinion was of the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued in their favour<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"They are happy in having found, in your zeal for the dignity of this nation, the means of liquidating their claims, and of concluding with the court of France a convention for the final &s;atisfaction of their demands; and have given us commi&s;&s;ion, in their names, and on their behalf, mo&s;t ear|ne&s;tly to intreat your acceptance of their grateful acknow|ledgments.&mdash;Whether they con&s;ider them&s;elves as Britons, or as men more particularly profiting by your generous and &s;pirited interpo&s;ition; they &s;ee great rea&s;ons to be thankful, for having been &s;upported by a mini&s;ter, in who&s;e public af|fections, in who&s;e wi&s;dom and activity, both the national ho|nour, and the intere&s;t of individuals, have been at once &s;o well &s;upported and &s;ecured."</Q>
Thanks of the Canada mer|chants to general Conway, London, April 28, 1776.</P></NOTE>. In what manner the execution of the convention has been &s;ince provided for, it is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to examine.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE proprietors had ab&s;olutely de&s;paired of being paid, at any time, any proportion of their demand, until the change of that mini&s;try. The merchants were checked and di&s;countenanced; they
<PB N="136" REF="139">
had often been told, by &s;ome in authority, of the cheap rate at which the&s;e Canada bills had been procured; yet the author can talk of the compo&s;i|tion of them as a nece&s;&s;ity induced by the change in admini&s;tration. They found them&s;elves indeed, before that change, under a nece&s;&s;ity of hinting &s;omewhat of bringing the matter into parliament; but they were &s;oon &s;ilenced, and put in mind of the fate which the Newfoundland bu&s;ine&s;s had there met with. Nothing &s;truck them more than the &s;trong contra&s;t between the &s;pirit, and method of proceeding, of the two admini&s;trations.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE earl of Halifax never did, nor could, refu&s;e to &s;ign this convention; becau&s;e this conven|tion, as it &s;tands, never was before him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See the convention it&s;elf, printed by Owen and Harri&s;on, Warwick-lane, 1766; particularly the articles two and thirteen.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE author's la&s;t charge on that mini&s;try, with regard to foreign affairs, is the Ru&s;&s;ian treaty of commerce, which the author thinks fit to a&s;&s;ert, was concluded<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">P. 23.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"on terms the earl of Bucking|ham&s;hire had refu&s;ed to accept of, and which had been deemed by former mini&s;ters di&s;advan|tageous to the nation, and by the merchants un&s;afe and unprofitable."</Q></P>
<P>BOTH the a&s;&s;ertions in this paragraph are equally groundle&s;s. The treaty then concluded by &s;ir George Macartney was not on the terms which the earl of Buckingham&s;hire had refu&s;ed. The earl of Buckingham&s;hire never did refu&s;e terms, becau&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s never came to the point of refu&s;al, or acceptance; all that he did was, to re|ceive the Ru&s;&s;ian project for a treaty of commerce, and to tran&s;mit it to England. This was in Novem|ber 1764; and he left Peter&s;burgh the January
<PB N="137" REF="140">
following, before he could even receive an an&s;wer from his own court. The conclu&s;ion of the treaty fell to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. Whoever will be at the trou|ble to compare it with the treaty of 1734, will, I believe, confe&s;s, that, if the former mini&s;ters could have obtained &s;uch terms, they were criminal in not accepting them.</P>
<P>BUT the merchants
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"deemed them un&s;afe and unprofitable."</Q>
What merchants? As no treaty ever was more maturely con&s;idered, &s;o the opinion of the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants in London was all along taken; and all the in&s;tructions &s;ent over were in exact conformity to that opinion. Our mini&s;ter there made no &s;tep without having previou&s;ly con|&s;ulted our merchants re&s;ident in Peter&s;burgh, who, before the &s;igning of the treaty, gave the mo&s;t full and unanimous te&s;timony in its favour. In their addre&s;s to our mini&s;ter at that court, among other things, they &s;ay,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It may afford &s;ome additional &s;atisfaction to your excellency, to receive a pub|lic acknowledgment of <HI>the entire and unre&s;erved approbation of every article</HI> in this treaty, from us who are &s;o immediately and &s;o nearly concerned in its con&s;equences."</Q>
This was &s;igned by the con&s;ul general, and every Briti&s;h merchant in Pe|ter&s;burgh.</P>
<P>THE approbation of tho&s;e immediately concern|ed in the con&s;equences is nothing to this author. He and his friends have &s;o much tenderne&s;s for peoples intere&s;ts, and under&s;tand them &s;o much better than they do them&s;elves, that, whil&s;t the&s;e politicians are contending for the be&s;t of po&s;&s;ible terms, the claimants are obliged to go without any terms at all.</P>
<P>ONE of the fir&s;t and ju&s;te&s;t complaints again&s;t the admini&s;tration of the author's friends, was the want
<PB N="138" REF="141">
of vigour in their foreign negotiations. Their immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors endeavoured to correct that error, along with others; and there was &s;carcely a foreign court, in which the new &s;pirit that had ari&s;en was not &s;en&s;ibly felt, acknowledged, and &s;ometimes complained of. On their coming into admini&s;tration, they found the demolition of Dun|kirk entirely at a &s;tand: in&s;tead of demolition, they found con&s;truction? for the French were then at work on the repair of the jettees. On the remon|&s;trances of general Conway, &s;ome parts of the&s;e jettees were immediately de&s;troyed. The duke of Richmond per&s;onally &s;urveyed the place, and ob|tained a fuller knowledge of its true &s;tate and con|dition than any of our mini&s;ters had done; and, in con&s;equence, had larger offers from the duke of Choi&s;eul than had ever been received. But, as the&s;e were &s;hort of our ju&s;t expectations under the treaty, he rejected them. Our then mini&s;ters, knowing that, in their admini&s;tration, the peoples minds were &s;et at ea&s;e upon all the e&s;&s;ential points of public and private liberty, and that no project of theirs could endanger the concord of the empire, were under no re&s;traint from pur&s;uing every ju&s;t demand upon foreign nations.</P>
<P>THE author, towards the end of this work, falls into reflections upon the &s;tate of public morals in this country: He draws u&s;e from his doctrine, by recommending his friend to the King and the pub|lic, as another duke of Sully; and he concludes the whole performance with a very devout prayer.</P>
<P>THE prayers of politicians may &s;ometimes be &s;incere; and as this prayer is in &s;ub&s;tance, that the author, or his friends, may be &s;oon brought into power, I have great rea&s;on to believe it is very much from the heart. It mu&s;t be owned too that, after he has drawn &s;uch a picture, &s;uch a &s;hocking
<PB N="139" REF="142">
picture, of the &s;tate of this country, he has great faith in thinking the means he prays for &s;ufficient to relieve us: after the character he has given of its inhabitants of all ranks and cla&s;&s;es, he has great charity in caring much about them; and indeed, no le&s;s hope, in being of opinion, that &s;uch a de|te&s;table nation can ever become the care of Pro|vidence. He has not even found five good men in our devoted city.</P>
<P>HE talks indeed of men of virtue and ability. But where are his <HI>men</HI> of virtue and ability to be found? Are they in the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration? never were a &s;et of people more blackened by this author. Are they among the party of tho&s;e (no &s;mall body) who adhere to the &s;y&s;tem of 1766? the&s;e, it is the great purpo&s;e of this book to ca|lumniate. Are they the per&s;ons who acted with his great friend, &s;ince the change in 1762, to his removal in 1765? &s;carcely any of the&s;e are now out of employment; and we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his de|&s;ideratum. Yet I think he hardly means to &s;elect, even &s;ome of the highe&s;t of them, as examples fit for the reformation of a corrupt world.</P>
<P>HE ob&s;erves, that the virtue of the mo&s;t exempla|ry prince that ever &s;wayed a &s;cepter<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">P. 46.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"can never warm or illuminate the body of his people, if foul mirrours are placed &s;o near him as to refract and di&s;&s;ipate the rays at their fir&s;t emanation."</Q>
Without ob&s;erving upon the propriety of this me|taphor, or a&s;king how mirrours come to have lo&s;t their old quality of reflecting, and to have acquired that of refracting, and di&s;&s;ipating rays, and how far their foulne&s;s will account for this change; the re|mark it&s;elf is common and true: no le&s;s true, and equally &s;urprizing from him, is that which imme|diately
<PB N="140" REF="143">
precedes it<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">P. 46.</NOTE>;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is in vain to endeavour to check the progre&s;s of irreligion and licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, by puni&s;hing &s;uch crimes in <HI>one individual,</HI> if others equally culpable are rewarded with the honours and emoluments of the &s;tate."</Q>
I am not in the &s;ecret of the author's manner of writing; but it appears to me, that he mu&s;t intend the&s;e reflections as a &s;atire upon the admini&s;tration of his happy years. Were ever the honours and emoluments of the &s;tate more lavi&s;hly &s;quandered upon per&s;ons &s;candalous in their lives than during that period? In the&s;e &s;candalous lives, was there any thing more &s;candalous than the mode of pu|ni&s;hing <HI>one culpable individual?</HI> In that individual, is any thing more culpable than his having been &s;e|duced by the example of &s;ome of tho&s;e very per|&s;ons by whom he was thus per&s;ecuted?</P>
<P>THE author is &s;o eager to attack others, that he provides but indifferently for his own defence. I believe, without going beyond the page I have now before me, he is very &s;en&s;ible, that I have &s;ufficient matter of further, and, if po&s;&s;ible, of heavier, charge again&s;t his friends, upon his own principles. But it is becau&s;e the advantage is too great, that I decline making u&s;e of it. I wi&s;h the author had not thought that all methods are lawful in party. Above all, he ought to have taken care not to wound his enemies through the &s;ides of his country. This he has done, by making that mon&s;trous and overcharged picture of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our &s;ituation. No wonder that he, who finds this country in the &s;ame condition with that of France at the time of Henry the Fourth, could al&s;o find a re&s;emblance between his political friend and the duke of Sully. As to tho&s;e per&s;onal re&s;em|blances, people will often judge of them from their
<PB N="141" REF="144">
affections: they may image in the&s;e clouds what|&s;oever figures they plea&s;e; but what is the con|formation of that eye which can di&s;cover a re&s;em|blance of this country and the&s;e times to tho&s;e with which the author compares them? France, a country ju&s;t recovered out of twenty-five years of the mo&s;t cruel and de&s;olating civil war that perhaps was ever known. The kingdom, under a veil of momentary quiet, full of the mo&s;t atrocious poli|tical, operating upon the mo&s;t furious fanatical factions. Some pretenders even to the crown, and tho&s;e who did not pretend to the whole, aimed at the partition of the monarchy. There were almo&s;t as many competitors as provinces; and all abet|ted by the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t ambitious, and mo&s;t enterprizing power in Europe. No place &s;afe from trea&s;on; no, not the bo&s;oms on which the mo&s;t amiable prince that ever lived repo&s;ed his head; not his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; not even his queen. As to the finances, they had &s;carce an exi&s;tence, but as a matter of plunder to the managers, and of grants to in&s;atiable and ungrateful courtiers.</P>
<P>HOW can our author have the heart to de&s;cribe this as any &s;ort of parallel to our &s;ituation? To be &s;ure, an April &s;hower has &s;ome re&s;emblance to a water-&s;pout; for they are both wet: and there is &s;ome likene&s;s between a &s;ummer evening's breeze and an hurricane; they are both wind: but who can compare our di&s;turbances, our &s;ituation, or our finances, to tho&s;e of France in the time of Henry? Great Britain is indeed at this time wearied, but not broken, with the efforts of a victorious foreign war; not &s;ufficiently relieved by an inadequate peace; but &s;omewhat benefited by that peace, and infinitely by the con&s;equences of that war. The powers of Europe awed by our victories, and lying in ruins upon every &s;ide of us. Burthened
<PB N="142" REF="145">
indeed we are with debt, but abounding with re+&s;ources. We have a trade, not perhaps equal to our wi&s;hes, but more than ever we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. In effect, no pretender to the crown; nor nutriment for &s;uch de&s;perate and de&s;tructive factions as have formerly &s;haken this kingdom.</P>
<P>AS to our finances, the author trifles with us. When Sully came to tho&s;e of France, in what order was any part of the financial &s;y&s;tem? or what &s;y&s;tem was there at all? There is no man in office who mu&s;t not be &s;en&s;ible that ours is, without the act of any parading mini&s;ter, the mo&s;t regular and orderly &s;y&s;tem perhaps that was ever known: the be&s;t &s;ecured again&s;t all frauds in the collection, and all mi&s;application in the expenditure of public money.</P>
<P>I ADMIT that, in this flouri&s;hing &s;tate of things, there are appearances enough to excite unea&s;ine&s;s and apprehen&s;ion. I admit there is a cankerworm in the ro&s;e:
<Q><L>&mdash;medio de fonte leporum</L>

<P>THIS is nothing el&s;e than a &s;pirit of di&s;connexion, of di&s;tru&s;t, and of treachery, among&s;t public men. It is no accidental evil; nor has its effect been tru&s;ted to the u&s;ual frailty of nature: the di&s;temper has been inoculated. The author is &s;en&s;ible of it, and we lament it together. This di&s;temper is alone &s;ufficient to take away con&s;iderably from the benefits of our con&s;titution and &s;ituation, and perhaps to render their continuance precarious. If the&s;e evil di&s;po&s;itions &s;hould &s;pread much farther, they mu&s;t end in our de&s;truction; for nothing can &s;ave a people de&s;titute of public and private faith. However, the author, for the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, has extended the charge by much too
<PB N="143" REF="146">
widely; as men are but too apt to take the mea|&s;ure of all mankind from their own particular ac|quaintance. Barren as this age may be in the growth of honour and virtue, the country does not want, at this moment, as &s;trong, and tho&s;e not a few examples, as were ever known, of an un&s;haken adherence to principle, and attachment to connexion, again&s;t every allurement of intere&s;t. Tho&s;e examples are not furni&s;hed by the great alone; nor by tho&s;e who&s;e activity in public affairs may render it &s;u&s;pected that they make &s;uch a character one of the rounds in their ladder of am|bition; but by men more quiet, and more in the &s;hade, on whom an unmixed &s;en&s;e of honour alone could operate. Such examples indeed are not furni&s;hed in great abundance among&s;t tho&s;e who are the &s;ubjects of the author's panegyric. He mu&s;t look for them in another camp. He who complains of the ill effects of a divided and hete|rogeneous admini&s;tration, is not ju&s;tifiable in la|bouring to render odious in the eyes of the public tho&s;e men, who&s;e principles, who&s;e maxims of policy, and who&s;e per&s;onal character, can alone admini&s;ter a remedy to this capital evil of the age; neither is he con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, in con|&s;tantly extolling tho&s;e whom he knows to be the authors of the very mi&s;chief of which he com|plains, and which the whole nation feels &s;o deeply.</P>
<P>THE per&s;ons who are the objects of his di&s;like and complaint are many of them of the fir&s;t fami|lies, and weightie&s;t properties, in the kingdom; but infinitely more di&s;tingui&s;hed for their untainted honour public and private, and their zealous but &s;ober attachment to the con&s;titution of their coun|try, than they can be by any birth, or any &s;tation. If they are the friends of any one great man ra|ther than another, it is not that they make his
<PB N="144" REF="147">
aggrandi&s;ement the end of their union; or becau&s;e they know him to be the mo&s;t active in caballing for his connexions the large&s;t and &s;peedie&s;t emolu|ments. It is becau&s;e they know him, by per&s;onal experience, to have wi&s;e and enlarged ideas of the public good, and an invincible con&s;tancy in ad|hering to it; becau&s;e they are convinced, by the whole tenour of his actions, that he will never ne|gotiate away their honour or his own: and that, in or out of power, change of &s;ituation will make no alteration in his conduct. This will give to &s;uch a per&s;on, in &s;uch a body, an authority and re&s;pect that no mini&s;ter ever enjoyed among his venal de|pendants, in the highe&s;t plenitude of his power; &s;uch as &s;ervility never can give, &s;uch as ambition never can receive or reli&s;h.</P>
<P>THIS body will often be reproached by their adver&s;aries, for want of ability in their political tran&s;actions; they will be ridiculed for mi&s;&s;ing many favourable conjunctures, and not profiting of &s;everal brilliant opportunities of fortune: but they mu&s;t be contented to endure that reproach; for they cannot acquire the reputation of <HI>that kind</HI> of ability without lo&s;ing all the other reputation they po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>THEY will be charged too with a dangerous &s;pirit of exclu&s;ion and pro&s;cription, for being un|willing to mix in &s;chemes of admini&s;tration, which have no bond of union, or principle of confidence. That charge too they mu&s;t &s;uffer with patience. If the rea&s;on of the thing had not &s;poken loudly enough, the mi&s;erable examples of the &s;everal ad|mini&s;trations con&s;tructed upon the idea of &s;y&s;tematic di&s;cord would be enough to frighten them from &s;uch mon&s;trous and ruinous conjunctions. It is however fal&s;e, that the idea of an united admi|ni&s;tration carries with it that of a pro&s;cription of
<PB N="145" REF="148">
any other party. It does indeed imply the nece&s;|&s;ity of having the great &s;trong holds of govern|ment in well-united hands, in order to &s;ecure the predominance of right and uniform principles; of having the capital offices of deliberation and exe|cution in tho&s;e who can deliberate with mutual con|fidence, and who will execute what is re&s;olved with firmne&s;s and fidelity. If this &s;y&s;tem cannot be rigorou&s;ly adhered to in practice (and what &s;y&s;|tem can be &s;o?) it ought to be the con&s;tant aim of good men to approach as nearly to it as po&s;&s;ible. No &s;y&s;tem of that kind can be formed, which will not leave room fully &s;ufficient for healing coaliti|ons: but no coalition, which, under the &s;pecious name of independency, carries in its bo&s;om the unreconciled principles of the original di&s;cord of parties, ever was, or will be, an healing coalition. Nor will the mind of our &s;overeign ever know repo&s;e, his kingdom &s;ettlement, or his bu&s;ine&s;s order, efficiency, or grace with his people, until things are e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the ba&s;is of &s;ome &s;et of men, who are tru&s;ted by the public, and who can tru&s;t one another.</P>
<P>THIS comes rather nearer to the mark than the author's de&s;cription of a proper admini&s;tration, under the name of <HI>men of ability and virtue,</HI> which conveys no definite idea at all; nor does it apply &s;pecifically to our grand national di&s;temper. All parties pretend to the&s;e qualities. The pre&s;ent mi|ni&s;try, no favourites of the author, will be ready enough to declare them&s;elves per&s;ons of virtue and ability; and if they choo&s;e a vote for that purpo&s;e, perhaps it would not be quite impo&s;&s;ible for them to procure it. But, if the di&s;ea&s;e be this di&s;tru&s;t and di&s;connexion, it is ea&s;y to know who are &s;ound, and who are tainted; who are fit to re&s;tore us to health, who to continue, and to &s;pread
<PB N="146" REF="149">
the contagion. The pre&s;ent mini&s;try being made up of draughts from all parties in the kingdom, if they &s;hould profe&s;s any adherence to the connexions they have left, they mu&s;t convict them&s;elves of the blacke&s;t treachery. They therefore choo&s;e rather to renounce the principle it&s;elf, and to brand it with the name of pride and faction. This te&s;t with certainty di&s;criminates the opinions of men. The other is a de&s;cription vague and un&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>AS to the unfortunate gentlemen who may at any time compo&s;e that &s;y&s;tem, which, under the plau&s;ible title of an admini&s;tration, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts but for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of weakne&s;s and confu&s;ion; they fall into different cla&s;&s;es, with different merits. I think the &s;ituation of &s;ome people in that &s;tate may de&s;erve a certain degree of compa&s;&s;ion; at the &s;ame time that they furni&s;h an example, which, it is to be hoped, by being a &s;evere one, will have its effect, at lea&s;t, on the growing generation; if an original &s;eduction, on plau&s;ible but hollow pre|tences, into lo&s;s of honour, friend&s;hip, con&s;i&s;tency, &s;ecurity, and repo&s;e, can furni&s;h it. It is po&s;&s;ible to draw, even from the very pro&s;perity of ambi|tion, examples of terror, and motives to compa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE the in&s;tances are exceedingly rare of mens immediately pa&s;&s;ing over a clear marked line of virtue into declared vice and corruption. There are a &s;ort of middle tints and &s;hades between the two extremes; there is &s;omething uncertain on the confines of the two empires which they fir&s;t pa&s;s through, and which renders the change ea&s;y and imperceptible. There are even a &s;ort of &s;plendid impo&s;itions &s;o well contrived, that, at the very time the path of rectitude is quitted for ever, men &s;eem to be advancing into &s;ome higher and nobler road
<PB N="147" REF="150">
of public conduct. Not that &s;uch impo&s;itions are &s;trong enough in them&s;elves; but a powerful in|tere&s;t, often concealed from tho&s;e whom it affects, works at the bottom, and &s;ecures the operation. Men are thus debauched away from tho&s;e legiti|mate connexions, which they had formed on a judgment, early perhaps, but &s;ufficiently mature, and wholly unbia&s;&s;ed. They do not quit them upon any ground of complaint, for grounds of ju&s;t complaint may exi&s;t, but upon the flattering and mo&s;t dangerous of all principles, that of mending what is well. Gradually they are habituated to other company; and a change in their habitudes &s;oon makes a way for a change in their opinions. Certain per&s;ons are no longer &s;o very frightful, when they come to be known and to be &s;ervice|able. As to their old friends, the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y; from friend&s;hip to civility; from civility to en|mity: few are the &s;teps from dereliction to per|&s;ecution.</P>
<P>PEOPLE not very well grounded in the princi|ples of public morality find a &s;et of maxims in office ready made for them, which they a&s;&s;ume as naturally and inevitably, as any of the in&s;ignia or in&s;truments of the &s;ituation. A certain tone of the &s;olid and practical is immediately acquired. Every former profe&s;&s;ion of public &s;pirit is to be con&s;i|dered as a debauch of youth, or, at be&s;t, as a vi&s;ionary &s;cheme of unattainable perfection. The very idea of con&s;i&s;tency is exploded. The conve|nience of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day is to furni&s;h the principle for doing it. Then the whole mini&s;terial cant is quickly got by heart. The prevalence of faction is to be lamented. All oppo&s;ition is to be regarded as the effect of envy and di&s;appointed ambition. All admini&s;trations are declared to be alike. The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity ju&s;tifies all their mea|&s;ures.
<PB N="148" REF="151">
It is no longer a matter of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, who or what admini&s;tration is; but that admini|&s;tration is to be &s;upported, is a general maxim. Flattering them&s;elves that their power is become nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of all order and govern|ment; every thing which tends to the &s;upport of that power is &s;anctified, and becomes a part of the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>GROWING every day more formed to affairs, and better knit in their limbs, when the occa&s;ion (now the only rule) requires it, they become capable of &s;acrificing tho&s;e very per&s;ons to whom they had be|fore &s;acrificed their original friends. It is now only in the ordinary cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s to alter an opinion, or to betray a connexion. Frequently relinqui&s;hing one &s;et of men and adopting another, they grow into a total indifference to human feeling, as they had before to moral obligation; until at length, no one original impre&s;&s;ion remains upon their minds; every principle is obliterated; every &s;entiment ef|faced.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, that power, which all the&s;e changes aimed at &s;ecuring, remains &s;till as tottering and as uncertain as ever. They are delivered up into the hands of tho&s;e who feel neither re&s;pect for their per&s;ons, nor gratitude for their favours; who are put about them in appearance to &s;erve, in reality to govern them; and, when the &s;ignal is given, to abandon and de&s;troy them in order to &s;et up &s;ome newer dupe of ambition, who in his turn is to be abandoned and de&s;troyed. Thus living in a &s;tate of continual unea&s;ine&s;s and ferment, &s;oftened only by the mi&s;erable con&s;olation of giving now and then preferments to tho&s;e for whom they have no value; they are unhappy in their &s;ituation, yet find it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;ign it. Until at length, &s;oured in temper, and di&s;appointed by the very at|tainment
<PB N="149" REF="152">
of their ends, in &s;ome angry, in &s;ome haughty, or &s;ome negligent moment, they incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of tho&s;e upon whom they have ren|dered their very being dependent. Then <HI>perie|runt tempora longi &s;ervitii</HI>; they are ca&s;t off with &s;corn; they are turned out, emptied of all natural character, of all intrin&s;ic worth, of all e&s;&s;ential dig|nity, and deprived of every con&s;olation of friend|&s;hip. Having rendered all retreat to old princi|ples ridiculous, and to old regards impracticable, not being able to counterfeit plea&s;ure, or to di&s;|charge di&s;content, nothing being &s;incere, or right, or balanced in their minds, it is more than a chance, that, in the delirium of the la&s;t &s;tage of their di&s;tempered power, they make an in&s;ane po|litical te&s;tament, by which they throw all their re|maining weight and con&s;equence into the &s;cale of their declared enemies, and the avowed authors of their de&s;truction. Thus they fini&s;h their cour&s;e. Had it been po&s;&s;ible that the whole, or even a great part of the&s;e effects on their minds, I &s;ay nothing of the effect upon their fortunes, could have appeared to them in their fir&s;t departure from the right line, it is certain they would have rejected every temptation with horror. The principle of the&s;e remarks, like every good principle in mora|lity, is trite; but its frequent application is not the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>As to others, who are plain practical men, they have been guiltle&s;s at all times of all public pre|tence. Neither the author nor any one el&s;e, has rea&s;on to be angry with them. They belonged to his friend for their intere&s;t; for their intere&s;t they quitted him; and when it is their intere&s;t, he may depend upon it, they will return to their former connexion. Such people &s;ub&s;i&s;t at all times, and, though the nui&s;ance of all, are at no time a worthy
<PB N="150" REF="153">
&s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It is fal&s;e virtue and plau&s;ible error that do the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>IF men come to government with right di&s;po|&s;itions, they have not that unfavourable &s;ubject which this author repre&s;ents to work upon. Our circum&s;tances are indeed critical; but then they are the critical circum&s;tances of a &s;trong and mighty nation. If corruption and meanne&s;s are greatly &s;pread, they are not &s;pread univer&s;ally. Many public men are hitherto examples of public &s;pirit and integrity. Whole parties, as far as large bo|dies can be uniform, have pre&s;erved character. However they may be deceived in &s;ome particu|lars, I know of no &s;et of men among&s;t us, which does not contain per&s;ons, on whom the nation, in a difficult exigence, may well value it&s;elf. Private life, which is the nur&s;ery of the commonwealth, is yet in general pure, and on the whole di&s;po&s;ed to virtue; and the people at large want neither gene|ro&s;ity nor &s;pirit. No &s;mall part of that very luxury, which is &s;o much the &s;ubject of the author's decla|mation, but which, in mo&s;t parts of life, by being well balanced and diffu&s;ed, is only decency and convenience, has perhaps as many, or more, good than evil con&s;equences attending it. It certainly excites indu&s;try, nouri&s;hes emulation, and in&s;pires &s;ome &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal value into all ranks of peo|ple. What we want is, to e&s;tabli&s;h more fully an opinion of uniformity, and con&s;i&s;tency of character, in the leading men of the &s;tate; &s;uch as will re&s;tore &s;ome confidence to profe&s;&s;ion and appearance, &s;uch as will fix &s;ubordination upon e&s;teem. Without this, all &s;chemes are begun at the wrong end. All who join in them are liable to their con&s;equences. All men who, under whatever pretext, take a part in the formation or the &s;upport of &s;y&s;tems con&s;tructed in &s;uch a manner as mu&s;t, in their nature, di&s;able them
<PB N="151" REF="154">
from the execution of their duty, have made them|&s;elves guilty of all the pre&s;ent di&s;traction, and of the future ruin, which they may bring upon their country.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;erious affair, this &s;tudied di&s;union in go|vernment. In ca&s;es where union is mo&s;t con&s;ulted in the con&s;titution of a mini&s;try, and where per|&s;ons are be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to promote it, differences, from the various ideas of men, will ari&s;e; and, from their pa&s;&s;ions, will often ferment into violent heats, &s;o as greatly to di&s;order all public bu&s;ine&s;s. What mu&s;t be the con&s;equence, when the very di&s;temper is made the ba&s;is of the con&s;titution; and the original weakne&s;s of humane nature is &s;till fur|ther enfeebled by art and contrivance? It mu&s;t &s;ub|vert government from the very foundation. It turns our public councils into the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous cabals; where the con&s;ideration is, not how the nation's bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hall be carried on, but how tho&s;e who ought to carry it on &s;hall circumvent each other. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, no order, unifor|mity, dignity, or effect, can appear in our pro|ceedings either at home or abroad. Nor will it make much difference, whether &s;ome of the con|&s;tituent parts of &s;uch an admini&s;tration are men of virtue or ability, or not; &s;uppo&s;ing it po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch men, with their eyes open, &s;hould choo&s;e to make a part in &s;uch a body.</P>
<P>THE effects of all human contrivances are in the hand of Providence. I do not like to an&s;wer, as our author &s;o readily does, for the event of any &s;peculation. But &s;ure the nature of our di&s;orders, if any thing, mu&s;t indicate the proper remedy. Men who act &s;teadily on the principles I have &s;tated may in all events be very &s;erviceable to their country; in one ca&s;e, by furni&s;hing (if their Sovereign &s;hould be &s;o advi&s;ed) an admini&s;tration formed upon ideas very different from tho&s;e which have for &s;ome time
<PB N="152" REF="155">
been unfortunately fa&s;hionable. But, if this &s;hould not be the ca&s;e, they may be &s;till &s;erviceable; for the example of a large body of men, &s;teadily &s;acri|ficing ambition to principle, can never be without u&s;e. It will certainly be prolific, and draw others to an imitation. <HI>Vera gloria radices agit, atque etiam propagatur.</HI></P>
<P>I DO not think my&s;elf of con&s;equence enough to imitate my author, in troubling the world with the prayers or wi&s;hes I may form for the public: full as little am I di&s;po&s;ed to imitate his profe&s;&s;ions; tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions are long &s;ince worn out in the political &s;ervice. If the work will not &s;peak for the author, his own declarations de&s;erve but little credit.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SO much mi&s;placed indu&s;try has been u&s;ed by the au|thor of the State of the Nation, as well as by other writers, to infu&s;e di&s;content into the people, on account of the late war, and of the effects of our national debt; that nothing ought to be omitted which may tend to di&s;|abu&s;e the public upon the&s;e &s;ubjects. When I had gone through the foregoing &s;heets, I recollected, that, in my pages 43 and 44, I only gave the comparative &s;tates of the duties collected by the exci&s;e at large; together with the quantities of &s;trong beer brewed in the two periods which are there compared. It might be &s;till thought, that &s;ome other articles of popular con&s;umption, of ge|neral convenience, and connected with our manufactures, might po&s;&s;ibly have declined. I therefore now think it right to lay before the reader the &s;tate of the produce of three capital duties on &s;uch articles; duties which have frequently been made the &s;ubject of popular complaint. The duty on candles; that on &s;oap, paper, &amp;c. and that on hides.

This encrea&s;e has not ari&s;en from any additional duties. None have been impo&s;ed on the&s;e articles during the war. Notwith&s;tanding the burthens of the war, and the late dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions, the con&s;umption of all the&s;e articles has encrea&s;ed, and the revenue along with it.</P>
<P>THERE is another point in The State of the Nation, to which, I fear, I have not been &s;o full in my an&s;wer as I ought to have been, and as I am well warranted to be. The author has endeavoured to throw a &s;u&s;picion, or &s;omething more, on that &s;alutary, and indeed nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure of opening the ports in Jamaica.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His note, p. 22.</NOTE>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Orders were given," &s;ays he,
"in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1765, for the free admi&s;&s;ion of Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els into all the colonies."</Q>
He then ob&s;erves, that the exports to Jamaica fell &pound;. 40.904 &s;hort of tho&s;e of 1764; and that the exports of the &s;uc|ceeding year, 1766, fell &s;hort of tho&s;e of 1765, about eighty pounds; from whence he wi&s;ely infers, that, this decline of exports being <HI>&s;ince</HI> the relaxation of the laws of trade, there is a ju&s;t ground of &s;u&s;picion, that the co|lonies have been &s;upplied with foreign commodities in&s;tead of Briti&s;h.</P>
<P>HERE, as u&s;ual with him, the author builds on a fact which is ab&s;olutely fal&s;e; and which, being &s;o, renders his whole hypothe&s;is ab&s;urd and impo&s;&s;ible. He a&s;&s;erts, that the order for admitting Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els was given in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1765. That order was not <HI>&s;igned at the trea&s;ury board until the</HI> 15<HI>th day of the November following</HI>; and therefore &s;o far from affecting the exports of the year 1765, that, &s;uppo&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible diligence in the com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms in expediting that order, and every advantage of ve&s;&s;els ready to &s;ail, and the mo&s;t favourable wind, it would hardly even arrive in Jamaica within the limits of that year.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="158">THIS order could therefore by no po&s;&s;ibility be a cau&s;e of the decrea&s;e of exports in 1765. If it had any mi&s;|chievous operation, it could not be before 1766. In that year, according to our author, the exports fell &s;hort of the preceding, ju&s;t <HI>eighty</HI> pounds. He is welcome to that diminution; and to all the con&s;equences he can draw from it.</P>
<P>BUT, as an auxiliary to account for this dreadful lo&s;s, he brings in the Free-port act, which he ob&s;erves (for his convenience) to have been made in &s;pring, 1766; but (for his convenience likewi&s;e) he forgets, that, by the expre&s;s provi&s;ion of the act, the regulation was not to be in force in Jamaica until the November following. Mira|culous mu&s;t be the activity of that contraband who&s;e ope|ration in America could, before the end of that year, have re-acted upon England, and checked the exportation from hence! unle&s;s he choo&s;es to &s;uppo&s;e, that the merchants, at who&s;e &s;olicitation this act had been obtained, were &s;o frighted at the accompli&s;hment of their own mo&s;t earne&s;t and anxious de&s;ire, that, before any good or evil effect from it could happen, they immediately put a &s;top to all further exportation.</P>
<P>IT is obvious that we mu&s;t look for the true effect of that act at the time of its fir&s;t po&s;&s;ible operation, that is, in the year 1767. On this idea how &s;tands the account?

This author, for the &s;ake of a pre&s;ent momentary credit, will hazard any future and permanent di&s;grace. At the time he wrote, the account of 1767 could not be made up. This was the very fir&s;t year of the trial of the Free-port act; and we find that the &s;ale of Briti&s;h commodities is &s;o far from le&s;&s;ened by that act, that the exports of 1767 amounts to &pound;. 52.000 more than that of either of the two preceding years, and is &pound;. 11.000 above that of his &s;tandard year 1764. If I could prevail on my&s;elf to argue
<PB N="156" REF="159">
in favour of a great commercial &s;cheme from the appear|ance of things in a &s;ingle year, I &s;hould from this encrea&s;e of export infer the beneficial effects of that mea&s;ure. In truth, it is not wanting. Nothing but the thicke&s;t igno|rance of the Jamaica trade could have made any one en|tertain a fancy, that the lea&s;t ill effect on our commerce could follow from this opening of the ports. But, if the author argues the effect of regulations in the American trade from the export of the year in which they are made, or even of the following; why did he not apply this rule to his own? He had the &s;ame paper before him which I have now before me. He mu&s;t have &s;een that in his &s;tandard year (the year 1764), the principal year of his new regulations, the export fell no le&s;s than &pound;. 128.450 &s;hort of that in 1763! Did the export trade revive by the&s;e regulations in 1765, during which year they conti|nued in their full force? It fell about &pound;. 40.000 &s;till lower. Here is a fall of &pound;. 168.000; to account for which, would have become the author much better than piddling for an &pound;. 80 fall in the year 1766 (the only year in which <HI>the order</HI> he objects to could operate), or in pre&s;uming a fall of exports from a regulation which took place only in No|vember 1766; who&s;e effects could not appear until the following year; and which, when they do appear, utterly overthrow all his flim&s;y rea&s;ons and affected &s;u&s;picions upon the effect of opening the ports.</P>
<P>THIS author, in the &s;ame paragraph, &s;ays, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it was a&s;&s;erted by <HI>the American factors and agents,</HI> that the com|manders of our &s;hips of war and tenders, having cu&s;tom-hou&s;e commi&s;&s;ions, and the &s;trict orders given in 1764 for a due execution of the laws of trade in the colonies, had deterred the Spaniards from trading with us; that the &s;ale of Briti&s;h manufactures in the We&s;t Indies had been greatly le&s;&s;ened, and the receipt of large &s;ums in &s;pecie prevented."</Q></P>
<P>IF the <HI>American factors and agents</HI> a&s;&s;erted this, they had good ground for their a&s;&s;ertion. They knew that the Spa|ni&s;h ve&s;&s;els had been driven from our ports. The author does not po&s;itively deny the fact. If he &s;hould, it will be

When the factors connected this mea&s;ure and its natural con&s;equences, with an actual fall in the exports to Jamaica, to no le&s;s an amount than &pound;. 128.450 in one year, and with a further fall in the next, is their a&s;&s;ertion very wonderful? The author him&s;elf is full as much alarmed by a fall of only &pound;. 40.000; for, giving him the facts which he chu&s;es to coin, it is no more. The ex|pul&s;ion of the Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els mu&s;t certainly have been one cau&s;e, if not of the fir&s;t declen&s;ion of the exports, yet of their continuance in their reduced &s;tate. Other cau&s;es had their operation, without doubt. In what degree each cau&s;e produced its effect, it is hard to determine. But the fact of a fall of exports upon the re&s;training plan, and of a ri&s;e upon the taking place of the enlarging plan, is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed beyond all contradiction.</P>
<P>THIS author &s;ays, that the facts relative to the Spani&s;h trade were a&s;&s;erted by <HI>American factors and agents</HI>; in&s;inu|ating, that the mini&s;try of 1766 had no better authority for their plan of enlargement than &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions.

<HEAD><PB REF="162">THOUGHTS ON THE CAUSE OF THE PRESENT DISCONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an undertaking of &s;ome degree of delicacy to examine into the cau&s;e of public di&s;orders. If a man happens not to &s;ucceed in &s;uch an enquiry, he will be thought weak and vi&s;ionary; if he touches the true grievance, there is a danger that he may come near to per&s;ons of weight and con&s;equence, who will rather be exa&s;perated at the di&s;covery of their errors, than thankful for the occa&s;ion of cor|recting them. If he &s;hould be obliged to blame the favourites of the people, he will be con&s;idered as the tool of power; if he cen&s;ures tho&s;e in power, he will be looked on as an in&s;trument of faction. But in all exertions of duty &s;omething is to be ha|zarded. In ca&s;es of tumult and di&s;order, our law has inve&s;ted every man, in &s;ome &s;ort, with the authority of a magi&s;trate. When the affairs of the nation are di&s;tracted, private people are, by the &s;pirit of that law, ju&s;tified in &s;tepping a little out of their ordinary &s;phere. They enjoy a privilege, of &s;omewhat more dignity and effect, than that of idle lamentation over the calamities of their coun|try. They may look into them narrowly; they

may rea&s;on upon them liberally; and if they &s;hould be &s;o fortunate as to di&s;cover the true &s;ource of the mi&s;chief, and to &s;ugge&s;t any probable method of removing it, though they may di&s;plea&s;e the rulers for the day, they are certainly of &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of government. Government is deeply in|tere&s;ted in every thing which, even through the medium of &s;ome temporary unea&s;ine&s;s, may tend finally to compo&s;e the minds of the &s;ubject, and to conciliate their affections. I have nothing to do here with the ab&s;tract value of the voice of the people. But as long as reputation, the mo&s;t pre|cious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every individual, and as long as opinion, the great &s;upport of the &s;tate, depend en|tirely upon that voice, it can never be con&s;idered as a thing of little con&s;equence either to individuals or to government. Nations are not primarily ruled by laws; le&s;s by violence. Whatever original energy may be &s;uppo&s;ed either in force or regula|tion; the operation of both is, in truth, merely in&s;trumental. Nations are governed by the &s;ame methods, and on the &s;ame principles, by which an individual without authority is often able to govern tho&s;e who are his equals or his &s;uperiors; by a knowledge of their temper, and by a judicious ma|nagement of it; I mean,&mdash;when public affairs are &s;teadily and quietly conducted; not when govern|ment is nothing but a continued &s;cuffle between the magi&s;trate and the multitude; in which &s;ometimes the one and &s;ometimes the other is uppermo&s;t; in which they alternately yield and prevail, in a &s;eries of contemptible victories and &s;candalous &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|ons. The temper of the people among&s;t whom he pre&s;ides ought therefore to be the fir&s;t &s;tudy of a &s;tate&s;man. And the knowledge of this temper it is by no means impo&s;&s;ible for him to attain, if he has not an intere&s;t in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="164">TO complain of the age we live in, to murmur at the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of power, to lament the pa&s;t, to conceive extravagant hopes of the future, are the common di&s;po&s;itions of the greate&s;t part of mankind; indeed the nece&s;&s;ary effects of the igno|rance and levity of the vulgar.

<P>NOBODY, I believe, will con&s;ider it merely as the language of &s;pleen or di&s;appointment, if I &s;ay, that there is &s;omething particularly alarming in the pre|&s;ent conjuncture. There is hardly a man in or out of power who holds any other language. That government is at once dreaded and contemned; that the laws are de&s;poiled of all their re&s;pected and &s;alutary terrors; that their inaction is a &s;ubject of ridicule, and their exertion of abhorrence; that rank, and office, and title, and all the &s;olemn plau|&s;ibilities of the world, have lo&s;t their reverence and effect; that our foreign politics are as much de|ranged as our dome&s;tic oeconomy; that our depend|encies are &s;lackened in their affection, and loo&s;en|ed from their obedience; that we know neither how to yield nor how to inforce; that hardly any thing above or below, abroad or at home, is &s;ound and intire; but that di&s;connexion and confu&s;ion, in of|fices, in parties, in families, in parliament, in the nation, prevail beyond the di&s;orders of any former time: the&s;e are facts univer&s;ally admitted and la|mented.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tate of things is the more extraordinary, becau&s;e the great parties which formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a
<PB N="164" REF="165">
manner entirely di&s;&s;olved. No great external ca|lamity has vi&s;ited the nation; no pe&s;tilence or fa|mine. We do not labour at pre&s;ent under any &s;cheme of taxation new or oppre&s;&s;ive in the quantity or in the mode. Nor are we engaged in un&s;ucce&s;s|ful war; in which, our misfortunes might ea&s;ily pervert our judgment; and our minds, &s;ore from the lo&s;s of national glory, might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible that the cau&s;e of this &s;trange di&s;|temper &s;hould not &s;ometimes become a &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e. It is a compliment due, and which I willingly pay, to tho&s;e who admini&s;ter our affairs, to take notice in the fir&s;t place of their &s;peculation. Our mini&s;ters are of opinion, that the increa&s;e of our trade and manufactures, that our growth by colo|nization and by conque&s;t, have concurred to accu|mulate immen&s;e wealth in the hands of &s;ome indi|viduals; and this again being di&s;per&s;ed among&s;t the people, has rendered them univer&s;ally proud, ferocious, and ungovernable; that the in&s;olence of &s;ome from their enormous wealth, and the boldne&s;s of others from a guilty poverty, have rendered them capable of the mo&s;t atrocious attempts; &s;o that they have trampled upon all &s;ubordination, and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free government; barriers too feeble again&s;t the fury of a populace &s;o fierce and licentious as ours. They contend, that no adequate provocation has been given for &s;o &s;preading a di&s;content; our affairs having been conducted throughout with remarkable temper and con&s;ummate wi&s;dom. The wicked indu&s;try of &s;ome libellers, joined to the intrigues of a few di&s;appointed politicians, have, in their opi|nion, been able to produce this unnatural ferment in the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="166">NOTHING indeed can be more unnatural than the pre&s;ent convul&s;ions of this country, if the above account be a true one.

that we &s;et our&s;elves to bite the hand that feeds us; that with a malignant in&s;anity we op|po&s;e the mea&s;ures, and ungratefully vilify the per|&s;ons, of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ole object is our own peace and pro&s;perity. If a few puny libellers, acting un|der a knot of factious politicians, without virtue, parts, or character (&s;uch they are con&s;tantly repre|&s;ented by the&s;e gentlemen), are &s;ufficient to excite this di&s;turbance, very perver&s;e mu&s;t be the di&s;po&s;i|tion of that people, among&s;t whom &s;uch a di&s;turb|ance can be excited by &s;uch means. It is be&s;ides no &s;mall aggravation of the public misfortune, that the di&s;ea&s;e, on this hypothe&s;is, appears to be with|out remedy. If the wealth of the nation be the cau&s;e of its turbulence, I imagine it is not propo&s;ed to introduce poverty, as a con&s;table to keep the peace. If our dominions abroad are the roots which feed all this rank luxuriance of &s;edition, it is not intended to cut them off in order to fami&s;h the fruit. If our liberty has enfeebled the executive power, there is no de&s;ign, I hope, to call in the aid of de&s;poti&s;m, to fill up the deficiencies of law. Whatever may be intended, the&s;e things are not yet profe&s;&s;ed. We &s;eem therefore to be driven to ab&s;olute de&s;pair; for we have no other materials to work upon, but tho&s;e out of which God has been plea&s;ed to form the inhabitants of this i&s;land. If the&s;e be radically and e&s;&s;entially vitious, all that can be &s;aid is, that tho&s;e men are very unhappy, to who&s;e fortune or duty it falls to admini&s;ter the af|fairs

of this untoward people. I hear it indeed &s;ometimes a&s;&s;erted, that a &s;teady per&s;everance in the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, and a rigorous puni&s;hment of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them, will in cour&s;e of time infal|libly put an end to the&s;e di&s;orders. But this, in my opinion, is &s;aid without much ob&s;ervation of our pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, and without any knowledge at all of the general nature of mankind. If the mat|ter of which this nation is compo&s;ed be &s;o very fer|mentable as the&s;e gentlemen de&s;cribe it, leaven ne|ver will be wanting to work it up, as long as di&s;con|tent, revenge, and ambition, have exi&s;ted in the world. Particular puni&s;hments are the cure for ac|cidental di&s;tempers in the &s;tate; they inflame rather than allay tho&s;e heats which ari&s;e from the &s;ettled mi&s;management of the government, or from a na|tural ill di&s;po&s;ition in the people. It is of the utmo&s;t moment not to make mi&s;takes in the u&s;e of &s;trong mea&s;ures; and firmne&s;s is then only a virtue when it accompanies the mo&s;t perfect wi&s;dom. In truth, incon&s;tancy is a &s;ort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance.</P>
<P>I AM not one of tho&s;e who think that the people are never in the wrong. They have been &s;o, fre|quently and outrageou&s;ly, both in other countries and in this. But I do &s;ay, that in all di&s;putes be|tween them and their rulers, the pre&s;umption is at lea&s;t upon a par in favour of the people. Experi|ence may perhaps ju&s;tify me in going further. Where popular di&s;contents have been very preva|lent; it may well be affirmed and &s;upported, that there has been generally &s;omething found ami&s;s in the con&s;titution, or in the conduct of government. The people have no intere&s;t in di&s;order. When they do wrong, it is their error, and not their crime. But with the governing part of the &s;tate, it is far otherwi&s;e.

What he &s;ays of revo|lutions, is equally true of all great di&s;turbances.

<P>UPON a &s;uppo&s;ition, therefore, that in the open|ing of the cau&s;e the pre&s;umptions &s;tand equally ba|lanced between the parties, there &s;eems &s;ufficient ground to entitle any per&s;on to a fair hearing, who attempts &s;ome other &s;cheme be&s;ide that ea&s;y one which is fa&s;hionable in &s;ome fa&s;hionable companies, to account for the pre&s;ent di&s;contents. It is not to be argued that we endure no grievance, becau&s;e our grievances are not of the &s;ame &s;ort with tho&s;e under which we laboured formerly; not preci&s;ely tho&s;e which we bore from the Tudors, or vindicated on the Stuarts. A great change has taken place in the affairs of this country. For in the &s;ilent lap&s;e of events as material alterations have been in&s;en&s;ibly brought about in the policy and character of go|vernments and nations, as tho&s;e which have been marked by the tumult of public revolutions.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="169">IT is very rare indeed for men to be wrong in their feelings concerning public mi&s;conduct; as rare to be right in their &s;peculation upon the cau&s;e of it. I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, that the genera|lity of people are fifty years, at lea&s;t, behind-hand in their politics. There are but very few, who are capable of comparing and dige&s;ting what pa&s;&s;es be|fore their eyes at different times and occa&s;ions, &s;o as to form the whole into a di&s;tinct &s;y&s;tem. But in books every thing is &s;ettled for them, without the exertion of any con&s;iderable diligence or &s;agacity. For which rea&s;on men are wi&s;e with but little re|flection, and good with little &s;elf-denial, in the bu|&s;ine&s;s of all times except their own. We are very uncorrupt and tolerably enlightened judges of the tran&s;actions of pa&s;t ages; where no pa&s;&s;ions deceive, and where the whole train of circum&s;tances, from the trifling cau&s;e to the tragical event, is &s;et in an orderly &s;eries before us. Few are the partizans of departed tyranny; and to be a whig on the bu&s;ine&s;s of an hundred years ago, is very con&s;i&s;tent with every advantage of pre&s;ent &s;ervility. This retro|&s;pective wi&s;dom, and hi&s;torical patrioti&s;m, are things of wonderful convenience; and &s;erve admirably to reconcile the old quarrel between &s;peculation and practice. Many a &s;tern republican, after gorging him&s;elf with a full fea&s;t of admiration of the Grecian commonwealths and of our true Saxon con&s;titution, and di&s;charging all the &s;plendid bile of his virtuous indignation on king John and king James, &s;its down perfectly &s;atisfied to the coar&s;e&s;t work and homelie&s;t job of the day he lives in. I believe there was no profe&s;&s;ed admirer of Henry the eighth among the in&s;truments of the la&s;t king James; nor in the court of Henry the eighth, was there, I dare &s;ay, to be found a &s;ingle advocate for the favourites of Richard the &s;econd.</P>
<P>NO complai&s;ance to our court, or to our age, can make me believe nature to be &s;o changed, but

that public liberty will be among us, as among our ance&s;tors, obnoxious to &s;ome per&s;on or other; and that opportunities will be furni&s;hed, for attempting at lea&s;t, &s;ome alteration to the prejudice of our con|&s;titution. The&s;e attempts will naturally vary in their mode according to times and circum&s;tances. For ambition, though it has ever the &s;ame general views, has not at all times the &s;ame means, nor the &s;ame particular objects. A great deal of the furni|ture of ancient tyranny is worn to rags; the re&s;t is entirely out of fa&s;hion. Be&s;ides, there are few &s;tate&s;men &s;o very clum&s;y and aukward in their bu|&s;ine&s;s, as to fall into the identical &s;nare which has proved fatal to their predece&s;&s;ors.

And when we hear any in|&s;tance of mini&s;terial rapacity, to the prejudice of the rights of private life, it will certainly not be the ex|action of two hundred pullets, from a woman of fa&s;hion, for leave to lie with her own hu&s;band<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Uxor Hugonis de Nevill dat Domino Regi ducentas Gallinas, eo quod po&s;&s;it jacere una nocte cum Domino &s;uo Hugone de Nevill."

<P>EVERY age has its own manners, and its politics dependent upon them; and the &s;ame attempts will not be made again&s;t a con&s;titution fully formed and matured, that were u&s;ed to de&s;troy it in the cradle, or to re&s;i&s;t its growth during its infancy.</P>
<P>AGAINST the being of parliament, I am &s;atisfi|ed, no de&s;igns have ever been entertained &s;ince the revolution. Every one mu&s;t perceive, that it is &s;trongly the intere&s;t of the court, to have &s;ome &s;e|cond cau&s;e interpo&s;ed between the mini&s;ters and
<PB N="170" REF="171">
the people. The gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons have an intere&s;t equally &s;trong, in &s;u&s;taining the part of that intermediate cau&s;e. However they may hire out the <HI>u&s;ufruct</HI> of their voices, they never will part with the <HI>fee and inheritance.</HI> Accordingly tho&s;e who have been of the mo&s;t known devotion to the will and plea&s;ure of a court, have at the &s;ame time been mo&s;t forward in a&s;&s;erting an high autho|rity in the Hou&s;e of Commons. When they knew who were to u&s;e that authority, and how it was to be employed, they thought it never could be carri|ed too far. It mu&s;t be always the wi&s;h of an un|con&s;titutional &s;tate&s;man, that an Hou&s;e of Commons who are entirely dependent upon him, &s;hould have every right of the people entirely dependant upon their plea&s;ure. It was &s;oon di&s;covered, that the forms of a free, and the ends of an arbitrary go|vernment, were things not altogether incompatible.</P>
<P>THE power of the crown, almo&s;t dead and rotten as prerogative, has grown up anew, with much more &s;trength, and far le&s;s odium, under the name of in|fluence. An influence, which operated without noi&s;e and without violence; an influence which converted the very antagoni&s;t, into the in&s;trument, of power; which contained in it&s;elf a perpetual principle of growth and renovation; and which the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and the pro&s;perity of the country equally tended to augment, was an admirable &s;ub&s;titute for a prerogative, that, being only the offspring of an|tiquated prejudices, had moulded in its original &s;ta|mina irre&s;i&s;tible principles of decay and di&s;&s;olution. The ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporary &s;y&s;tem; the intere&s;t of active men in the &s;tate is a foundation perpetual and infallible. How|ever, &s;ome circum&s;tances, ari&s;ing, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, in a great degree from accident, prevented the effects of this influence for a long time from
<PB N="171" REF="172">
breaking out in a manner capable of exciting any &s;erious apprehen&s;ions. Although government was &s;trong and flouri&s;hed exceedingly, the <HI>Court</HI> had drawn far le&s;s advantage than one would imagine from this great &s;ource of power.</P>
<P>AT the revolution, the crown, deprived, for the ends of the revolution it&s;elf, of many prerogatives, was found too weak to &s;truggle again&s;t all the diffi|culties which pre&s;&s;ed &s;o new and un&s;ettled a go|vernment. The court was obliged therefore to de|legate a part of its powers to men of &s;uch intere&s;t as could &s;upport, and of &s;uch fidelity as would ad|here to, its e&s;tabli&s;hment. Such men were able to draw in a greater number to a concurrence in the common defence. This connexion, nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t, continued long after convenient; and properly conducted might indeed, in all &s;ituations, be an u&s;eful in&s;trument of government. At the &s;ame time, through the intervention of men of popular weight and character, the people po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ecurity for their ju&s;t portion of importance in the &s;tate. But as the title to the crown grew &s;tronger by long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and by the con&s;tant increa&s;e of its influence, the&s;e helps have of late &s;eemed to certain per&s;ons no better than incumbrances. The powerful ma|nagers for government were not &s;ufficiently &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive to the plea&s;ure of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of immedi|ate and per&s;onal favour, &s;ometimes from a confi|dence in their own &s;trength natural and acquired; &s;ometimes from a fear of offending their friends, and weakening that lead in the country, which gave them a con&s;ideration independent of the court. Men acted as if the court could receive, as well as confer, an obligation. The influence of govern|ment, thus divided in appearance between the court and the leaders of parties, became in many ca&s;es an acce&s;&s;ion rather to the popular than to the royal
<PB N="172" REF="173">
&s;cale; and &s;ome part of that influence which would otherwi&s;e have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as in a &s;ort of mort-main and unalienable domain, returned again to the great ocean from whence it aro&s;e, and circu|lated among the people. This method therefore of governing, by men of great natural intere&s;t or great acquired con&s;ideration, was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers of ab&s;olute mo|narchy. It is the nature of de&s;poti&s;m to abhor power held by any means but its own momentary plea&s;ure; and to annihilate all intermediate &s;itua|tions between boundle&s;s &s;trength on its own part, and total debility on the part of the people.</P>
<P>TO get rid of all this intermediate and inde|pendent importance, and <HI>to &s;ecure to the court the unlimited and uncontrouled u&s;e of its own va&s;t influ|ence, under the &s;ole direction of its own private fa|vour,</HI> has for &s;ome years pa&s;t been the great object of policy. If this were compa&s;&s;ed, the influence of the crown mu&s;t of cour&s;e produce all the effects which the mo&s;t &s;anguine partizans of the court could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire. Government might then be carried on without any concurrence on the part of the people, without any attention to the dignity of the greater, or to the affections of the lower &s;orts. A new project was therefore devi&s;ed, by a certain &s;et of intriguing men, totally different from the &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration which had pre|vailed &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;|wick. This project, I have heard, was fir&s;t con|ceived by &s;ome per&s;ons in the court of Frederick prince of Wales.</P>
<P>THE earlie&s;t attempt in the execution of this de&s;ign was to &s;et up for mini&s;ter, a per&s;on, in rank indeed re&s;pectable, and very ample in fortune; but who, to the moment of this va&s;t and &s;udden elevation, was little known or con&s;idered in the
<PB N="173" REF="174">
kingdom. To him the whole nation was to yield an immediate and implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But whe|ther it was for want of firmne&s;s to bear up again&s;t the fir&s;t oppo&s;ition; or that things were not yet fully ripened, or that this method was not found the mo&s;t eligible; that idea was &s;oon abandoned. The in&s;trumental part of the project was a little altered, to accommodate it to the time, and to bring things more gradually and more &s;urely to the one great end propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t part of the reformed plan was to draw <HI>a line which &s;hould &s;eparate the court from the mini&s;try.</HI> Hitherto the&s;e names had been looked upon as &s;ynonymous; but for the future, court and admini&s;tration were to be con&s;idered as things totally di&s;tinct. By this operation, two &s;y&s;tems of admini&s;tration were to be formed; one which &s;hould be in the real &s;ecret and confidence; the other merely o&s;ten&s;ible, to perform the official and executory duties of government. The latter were alone to be re&s;pon&s;ible; whil&s;t the real advi&s;ers, who enjoyed all the power, were effectually re|moved from all the danger.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, <HI>A party under the&s;e leaders was to be formed in favour of the court again&s;t the mini&s;try:</HI> this party was to have a large &s;hare in the emo|luments of government, and to hold it totally &s;eparate from, and independent of, o&s;ten&s;ible ad|mini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE third point, and that on which the &s;ucce&s;s of the whole &s;cheme ultimately depended, was <HI>to bring parliament to an acquie&s;cence in this project.</HI> Parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a total indifference to the per&s;ons, rank, influence, abilities, connexions, and character, of the mi|ni&s;ters of the crown. By means of a di&s;cipline,
<PB N="174" REF="175">
on which I &s;hall &s;ay more hereafter, that body was to be habituated to the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts, and the mo&s;t di&s;cordant politics. All connexions and dependencies among &s;ubjects were to be entirely di&s;&s;olved. As hitherto bu&s;ine&s;s had gone through the hands of leaders of whigs or tories, men of ta|lents to conciliate the people, and engage to their confidence, now the method was to be altered; and the lead was to be given to men of no &s;ort of con&s;ideration or credit in the country. This want of natural importance was to be their very title to delegated power. Members of parliament were to be hardened into an in&s;en&s;ibility to pride as well as to duty. Tho&s;e high and haughty &s;enti|ments, which are the great &s;upport of independ|ence, were to be let down gradually. Point of honour and precedence were no more to be re|garded in parliamentary decorum, than in a Turki&s;h army. It was to be avowed as a con&s;titutional maxim, that the king might appoint one of his footmen, or one of your footmen, for mini&s;ter; and that he ought to be, and that he would be, as well followed as the fir&s;t name for rank and wi&s;dom in the nation. Thus parliament was to look on, as if perfectly unconcerned; while a cabal of the clo&s;et and back-&s;tairs was &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of a na|tional admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>WITH &s;uch a degree of acquie&s;cence, any mea|&s;ure of any court might well be deemed thoroughly &s;ecure. The capital objects, and by much the mo&s;t flattering characteri&s;tics of arbitrary power, would be obtained. Every thing would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the per&s;onal favour and inclination of the prince. This favour would be the &s;ole introduction to power, and the only tenure by which it was to be held: &s;o that no per&s;on looking towards another, and all looking
<PB N="175" REF="176">
towards the court, it was impo&s;&s;ible but that the motive which &s;olely influenced every man's hopes mu&s;t come in time to govern every man's con|duct; till at la&s;t the &s;ervility became univer&s;al, in &s;pite of the dead letter of any laws or in&s;titutions what&s;oever.</P>
<P>HOW it &s;hould happen that any man could be tempted to venture upon &s;uch a project of govern|ment, may at fir&s;t view appear &s;urprizing. But the fact is, that opportunities very inviting to &s;uch an attempt have offered; and the &s;cheme it&s;elf was not de&s;titute of &s;ome arguments not wholly un|plau&s;ible to recommend it. The&s;e opportunities and the&s;e arguments, the u&s;e that has been made of both, the plan for carrying this new &s;cheme of government into execution, and the effects which it has produced, are in my opinion worthy of our &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>HIS maje&s;ty came to the throne of the&s;e king|doms with more advantages than any of his prede|ce&s;&s;ors &s;ince the Revolution. Fourth in de&s;cent, and third in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of his royal family, even the zealots of hereditary right, in him, &s;aw &s;omething to flatter their favourite prejudices; and to ju&s;tify a transfer of their attachments, without a change in their principles. The per&s;on and cau&s;e of the Pretender were become contemptible; his title di&s;|owned throughout Europe, his party di&s;banded in England. His maje&s;ty came indeed to the inhe|ritance of a mighty war; but, victorious in every part of the globe, peace was always in his power, not to negociate, but to dictate. No foreign habi|tudes or attachments withdrew him from the culti|vation of his power at home. His revenue for the civil e&s;tabli&s;hment, fixed (as it was then thought) at a large, but definite &s;um, was ample, without being invidious. His influence, by additions from
<PB N="176" REF="177">
conque&s;t, by an augmentation of debt, by an in|crea&s;e of military and naval e&s;tabli&s;hment, much &s;trengthened and extended. And coming to the throne in the prime and full vigour of youth, as from affection there was a &s;trong di&s;like, &s;o from dread there &s;eemed to be a general aver&s;ene&s;s, from giving any thing like offence to a monarch, again&s;t who&s;e re&s;entment oppo&s;ition could not look for a refuge in any &s;ort of rever&s;ionary hope.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ingular advantages in&s;pired his maje&s;ty only with a more ardent de&s;ire to pre&s;erve unim|paired the &s;pirit of that national freedom, to which he owed a &s;ituation &s;o full of glory. But to others it &s;ugge&s;ted &s;entiments of a very different nature. They thought they now beheld an oppor|tunity (by a certain &s;ort of &s;tate&s;men never long undi&s;covered or unemployed) of drawing to them|&s;elves, by the aggrandi&s;ement of a court faction, a degree of power which they could never hope to de|rive from natural influence or from honourable &s;er|vice; and which it was impo&s;&s;ible they could hold with the lea&s;t &s;ecurity, whil&s;t the &s;y&s;tem of admini|&s;tration re&s;ted upon its former bottom. In order to facilitate the execution of their de&s;ign, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make many alterations in political ar|rangement, and a &s;ingle change in the opinions, habits, and connexions of the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who at that time acted in public.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, they proceeded gradually, but not &s;lowly, to de&s;troy every thing of &s;trength which did not derive its principal nouri&s;hment from the immediate plea&s;ure of the court. The greate&s;t weight of popular opinion and party connexion were then with the duke of Newca&s;tle and Mr. Pitt. Neither of the&s;e held their importance by the <HI>new tenure</HI> of the court; they were not therefore thought to be &s;o proper as others for the &s;ervices
<PB N="177" REF="178">
which were required by that tenure. It happened very favourably for the new &s;y&s;tem, that under a forced coalition there rankled an incurable aliena|tion and di&s;gu&s;t between the parties which compo&s;ed the admini&s;tration. Mr. Pitt was fir&s;t attacked. Not &s;atisfied with removing him from power, they endeavoured by various artifices to ruin his cha|racter. The other party &s;eemed rather plea&s;ed to get rid of &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive a &s;upport; not perceiving, that their own fall was prepared by his, and in|volved in it. Many other rea&s;ons prevented them from daring to look their true &s;ituation in the face. To the great Whig families it was extremely di&s;a|greeable, and &s;eemed almo&s;t unnatural, to oppo&s;e the admini&s;tration of a prince of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;|wic. Day after day they he&s;itated, and doubted, and lingered, expecting that other coun&s;els would take place; and were &s;low to be per&s;uaded, that all which had been done by the cabal, was the effect not of humour, but of &s;y&s;tem. It was more &s;trongly and evidently the intere&s;t of the new court faction, to get rid of the great Whig connexions, than to de&s;troy Mr. Pitt. The power of that gentleman was va&s;t indeed and merited; but it was in a great degree per&s;onal, and therefore tran&s;ient. Theirs was rooted in the country. For, with a good deal le&s;s of popularity, they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a far more natural and fixed influence. Long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of government; va&s;t property; ob|ligations of favours given and received; connexion of offices; ties of blood, of alliance, of friend&s;hip (things at that time &s;uppo&s;ed of &s;ome force); the name of Whig, dear to the majority of the people; the zeal early begun and &s;teadily continued to the royal family: all the&s;e together formed a body of power in the nation, which was criminal and de|voted. The great ruling principle of the cabal, and that which animated and harmonized all their proceedings, how various &s;oever they may have
<PB N="178" REF="179">
been, was to &s;ignify to the world, that the court would proceed upon its own proper forces only; and that the pretence of bringing any other into its &s;ervice was an affront to it, and not a &s;upport. Therefore, when the chiefs were removed, in order to go to the root, the whole party was put under a pro&s;cription, &s;o general and &s;evere as to take their hard-earned bread from the lowe&s;t officers, in a manner which had never been known before, even in general revolutions. But it was thought nece&s;&s;ary effectually to de&s;troy all dependencies but one; and to &s;hew an example of the firmne&s;s and rigour with which the new &s;y&s;tem was to be &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>THUS for the time were pulled down, in the per&s;ons of the Whig leaders and of Mr. Pitt (in &s;pite of the &s;ervices of the one at the acce&s;&s;ion of the royal family, and the recent &s;ervices of the other in the war) the <HI>two only &s;ecurities for the importance of the people; power ari&s;ing from popularity; and power ari&s;ing from connexion.</HI> Here and there indeed a few individuals were left &s;tanding, who gave &s;ecurity for their total e&s;trangement from the odious principles of party connexion and per&s;onal attachment; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that mo&s;t of them have religiou&s;ly kept their faith. Such a change could not however be made without a mighty &s;hock to government.</P>
<P>TO reconcile the minds of the people to all the&s;e movements, principles corre&s;pondent to them had been preached up with great zeal. Every one mu&s;t remember that the cabal &s;et out with the mo&s;t a&s;to|ni&s;hing prudery, both moral and political. Tho&s;e who in a few months after &s;ou&s;ed over head and ears into the deepe&s;t and dirtie&s;t pits of corruption, cried out violently again&s;t the indirect practices in the electing and managing of parliaments, which had formerly prevailed. This marvellous abhor|rence
<PB N="179" REF="180">
which the court had &s;uddenly taken to all in|fluence, was not only circulated in conver&s;ation through the kingdom, but pompou&s;ly announced to the public, with many other extraordinary things, in a pamphlet<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sentiments of an hone&s;t Man.</NOTE> which had all the appearance of a manife&s;to preparatory to &s;ome con&s;iderable enter|prize. Throughout, it was a &s;atire, though in terms managed and decent enough, on the politics of the former reign. It was indeed written with no &s;mall art and addre&s;s.</P>
<P>IN this piece appeared the fir&s;t dawning of the new &s;y&s;tem; there fir&s;t appeared the idea (then only in &s;peculation) of <HI>&s;eparating the court from the admi|ni&s;tration</HI>; of carrying every thing from national connexion to per&s;onal regards; and of forming a regular party for that purpo&s;e, under the name of <HI>king's men.</HI></P>
<P>TO recommend this &s;y&s;tem to the people, a per|&s;pective view of the court gorgeou&s;ly painted, and finally illuminated from within, was exhibited to the gaping multitude. Party was to be totally done away, with all its evil works. Corruption was to be ca&s;t down from court, as <HI>At&egrave;</HI> was from Heaven. Power was thenceforward to be the cho&s;en re&s;idence of public &s;pirit; and no one was to be &s;uppo&s;ed un|der any &s;ini&s;ter influence, except tho&s;e who had the misfortune to be in di&s;grace at court, which was to &s;tand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions. A &s;cheme of perfection to be realized in a monarchy far beyond the vi&s;ionary republic of Plato. The whole &s;cenery was exactly di&s;po&s;ed to captivate tho&s;e good &s;ouls, who&s;e credulous morality is &s;o in valuable a trea&s;ure to crafty politicians. Indeed there was wherewithal to charm every body, ex|cept tho&s;e few who are not much plea&s;ed with pro|fe&s;&s;ions
<PB N="180" REF="181">
of &s;upernatural virtue, who know of what &s;tuff &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions are made, for what purpo&s;es they are de&s;igned, and in what they are &s;ure con|&s;tantly to end. Many innocent gentlemen, who had been talking pro&s;e all their lives without knowing any thing of the matter, began at la&s;t to open their eyes upon their own merits, and to attribute their not having been lords of the Trea&s;ury and lords of Trade many years before, merely to the preva|lence of party, and to the mini&s;terial power, which had fru&s;trated the good intentions of the court in favour of their abilities. Now was the time to un|lock the &s;ealed fountain of royal bounty, which had been infamou&s;ly monopolized and huck&s;tered, and to let it flow at large upon the whole people. The time was come, to re&s;tore royalty to its original &s;plendour. <HI>Mettre le roy hors de page,</HI> became a &s;ort of watch-word. And it was con&s;tantly in the mouths of all the runners of the court, that nothing could pre&s;erve the balance of the con&s;titution from be|ing overturned by the rabble, or by a faction of the nobility, but to free the &s;overeign effectually from that mini&s;terial tyranny under which the royal dig|nity had been oppre&s;&s;ed in the per&s;on of his ma|je&s;ty's grandfather.</P>
<P>THESE were &s;ome of the many artifices u&s;ed to reconcile the people to the great change which was made in the per&s;ons who compo&s;ed the mini&s;try, and the &s;till greater which was made and avowed in its con&s;titution. As to individuals, other me|thods were employed with them; in order &s;o thoroughly to di&s;unite every party, and even every family, that <HI>no concert, order, or effect, might appear in any future oppo&s;ition.</HI> And in this manner an admini&s;tration without connexion with the peo|ple, or with one another, was fir&s;t put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of government. What good con&s;equences followed
<PB N="181" REF="182">
from it, we have all &s;een; whether with regard to virtue, public or private; to the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of the &s;overeign; or to the real &s;trength of govern|ment. But as &s;o much &s;tre&s;s was then laid on the nece&s;&s;ity of this new project, it will not be ami&s;s to take a view of the effects of this royal &s;ervitude and vile durance, which was &s;o deplored in the reign of the late monarch, and was &s;o carefully to be avoided in the reign of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. The effects were the&s;e.</P>
<P>IN times full of doubt and danger to his per&s;on and family, George the &s;econd maintained the dig|nity of his crown connected with the liberty of his people, not only unimpaired, but improved, for the &s;pace of thirty-three years. He overcame a dangerous rebellion, abetted by foreign force, and raging in the heart of his kingdoms; and thereby de&s;troyed the &s;eeds of all future rebellion that could ari&s;e upon the &s;ame principle. He carried the glory, the power, the commerce of England, to an height unknown even to this renowned nation in the times of its greate&s;t pro&s;perity; and he left his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion re&s;ting on the true and only true foundations of all national and all regal greatne&s;s; affection at home, reputation abroad, tru&s;t in allies, terror in rival nations. The mo&s;t ardent lover of his country cannot wi&s;h for Great Britain an happier fate than to continue as &s;he was then left. A people emulous as we are in affection to our pre&s;ent &s;o|vereign, know not how to form a prayer to Heaven for a greater ble&s;&s;ing upon his virtues, or an higher &s;tate of felicity and glory, than that he &s;hould live, and &s;hould reign, and, when Providence ordains it, &s;hould die, exactly like his illu&s;trious prede|ce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>A GREAT prince may be obliged (though &s;uch a thing cannot happen very often) to &s;acrifice his pri|vate
<PB N="182" REF="183">
inclination to his public intere&s;t. A wi&s;e prince will not think that &s;uch a re&s;traint implies a condition of &s;ervility; and truly, if &s;uch was the condition of the la&s;t reign, and the effects were al&s;o &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed, we ought, no le&s;s for the &s;ake of the &s;overeign whom we love, than for our own, to hear arguments convincing indeed, before we depart from the maxims of that reign, or fly in the face of this great body of &s;trong and recent experience.</P>
<P>ONE of the principal topics which was then, and has been &s;ince, much employed by that political<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">See the Political Writings of the late Dr. Brown, and many others.</NOTE> &s;chool, is an affected terror of the growth of an ari&s;tocratic power, prejudicial to the rights of the crown, and the balance of the con&s;titution. Any new powers exerci&s;ed in the hou&s;e of lords, or in the hou&s;e of commons, or by the crown, ought certainly to excite the vigilant and anxious jealou&s;y of a free people. Even a new and unprecedented cour&s;e of action in the whole legi&s;lature, without great and evident rea&s;on, may be a &s;ubject of ju&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. I will not affirm, that there may not have lately appeared in the hou&s;e of lords a di&s;po|&s;ition to &s;ome attempts derogatory to the legal rights of the &s;ubject. If any &s;uch have really ap|peared, they have ari&s;en, not from a power pro|perly ari&s;tocratic, but from the &s;ame influence which is charged with having excited attempts of a &s;imilar nature in the hou&s;e of commons; which hou&s;e, if it &s;hould have been betrayed into an un|fortunate quarrel with its con&s;tituents, and involv|ed in a charge of the very &s;ame nature, could have neither power nor inclination to repel &s;uch attempts in others. Tho&s;e attempts in the hou&s;e of lords can no more be called ari&s;tocratic pro|ceedings,
<PB N="183" REF="184">
than the proceedings with regard to the county of Middle&s;ex in the hou&s;e of commons can with any &s;en&s;e be called democratical.</P>
<P>IT is true, that the peers have a great influence in the kingdom, and in every part of the public concerns. While they are men of property, it is impo&s;&s;ible to prevent it, except by &s;uch means as mu&s;t prevent all property from its natural opera|tion; an event not ea&s;ily to be compa&s;&s;ed, while property is power; nor by any means to be wi&s;h|ed, while the lea&s;t notion exi&s;ts of the method by which the &s;pirit of liberty acts, and of the means by which it is pre&s;erved. If any particular peers, by their uniform, upright, con&s;titutional conduct, by their public and their private virtues, have ac|quired an influence in the country; the people, on who&s;e favour that influence depends, and from whom it aro&s;e, will never be duped into an opini|on, that &s;uch greatne&s;s in a peer is the de&s;poti&s;m of an ari&s;tocracy, when they know and feel it to be the effect and pledge of their own importance.</P>
<P>I AM no friend to ari&s;tocracy, in the &s;en&s;e at lea&s;t in which that word is u&s;ually under&s;tood. If it were not a bad habit to moot ca&s;es on the &s;up|po&s;ed ruin of the con&s;titution, I &s;hould be free to declare, that if it mu&s;t peri&s;h, I would rather by far &s;ee it re&s;olved into any other form, than lo&s;t in that au&s;tere and in&s;olent domination. But, what|ever my di&s;likes may be, my fears are not upon that quarter. The que&s;tion, on the influence of a court, and of a peerage, is not, which of the two dangers is the mo&s;t eligible, but which is the mo&s;t imminent. He is but a poor ob&s;erver, who has not &s;een, that the generality of peers, far from &s;upporting them&s;elves in a &s;tate of independent greatne&s;s, are but too apt to fall into an oblivion of their proper dignity, and to run headlong into
<PB N="184" REF="185">
an abject &s;ervitude. Would to God it were true, that the fault of our peers were too much &s;pirit! It is worthy of &s;ome ob&s;ervation, that the&s;e gen|tlemen, &s;o jealous of ari&s;tocracy, make no com|plaints of the power of tho&s;e peers (neither few nor incon&s;iderable) who are always in the train of a court, and who&s;e whole weight mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as a portion of the &s;ettled influence of the crown. This is all &s;afe and right: but if &s;ome peers (I am very &s;orry they are not as many as they ought to be) &s;et them&s;elves, in the great con|cern of peers and commons, again&s;t a back-&s;tairs influence and clande&s;tine government, then the alarm begins; then the con&s;titution is in danger of being forced into an ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>I REST a little the longer on this court topic, becau&s;e it was much in&s;i&s;ted upon at the time of the great change, and has been &s;ince frequently revived by many of the agents of that party: for, whil&s;t they are terrifying the great and opulent with the horrors of mob-government, they are by other managers attempting (though hitherto with little &s;ucce&s;s) to alarm the people with a phantom of tyranny in the nobles. All this is done upon their favourite principle of di&s;union, of &s;owing jea|lou&s;ies among&s;t the different orders of the &s;tate, and of disjointing the natural &s;trength of the kingdom; that it may be rendered incapable of re&s;i&s;ting the &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns of wicked men, who have engro&s;&s;ed the royal power.</P>
<P>THUS much of the topics cho&s;en by the cour|tiers to recommend their &s;y&s;tem; it will be nece&s;|&s;ary to open a little more at large the nature of that party which was formed for its &s;upport. Without this, the whole would have been no better than a vi&s;ionary amu&s;ement, like the &s;cheme of Harrington's political club, and not a bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="185" REF="186">
in which the nation had a real concern. As a powerful party, and a party con&s;tructed on a new principle, it is a very inviting object of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be remembered, that &s;ince the revolu|tion, until the period we are &s;peaking of, the in|fluence of the crown had been always employed in &s;upporting the mini&s;ters of &s;tate, and in carry|ing on the public bu&s;ine&s;s according to their opini|ons. But the party now in que&s;tion is formed upon a very different idea. It is to intercept the favour, protection and confidence of the crown in the pa&s;&s;age to its mini&s;ters; it is to come between them and their importance in parliament; it is to &s;eparate them from all their natural and acquired dependencies; it is intended as the controul, not the &s;upport, of admini&s;tration. The machinery of this &s;y&s;tem is perplexed in its movements, and fal&s;e in its principle. It is formed on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the king is &s;omething external to his govern|ment; and that he may be honoured and ag|grandized, even by its debility and di&s;grace. The plan proceeds expre&s;sly on the idea of enfeebling the regular executory power. It proceeds on the idea of weakening the &s;tate in order to &s;trengthen the court. The &s;cheme depending entirely on di&s;tru&s;t, on di&s;connexion, on mutability by prin|ciple, on &s;y&s;tematic weakne&s;s in every particular member; it is impo&s;&s;ible that the total re&s;ult &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tantial &s;trength of any kind.</P>
<P>AS a foundation of their &s;cheme, the cabal have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ort of <HI>rota</HI> in the court. All &s;orts of parties, by this means, have been brought into admini&s;tration, from whence few have had the good fortune to e&s;cape without di&s;grace; none at all without con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;es. In the beginning of each arrangement no profe&s;&s;ions of confidence and &s;upport are wanting, to induce the leading

men to engage. But while the mini&s;ters of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power, while they have all their canvas &s;pread out to the wind, and every &s;ail filled with the fair and pro&s;|perous gale of royal favour, in a &s;hort time they find, they know not how, a current, which &s;ets directly again&s;t them; which prevents all progre&s;s; and even drives them backwards. They grow a&s;hamed and mortified in a &s;ituation, which, by its vicinity to power, only &s;erves to remind them the more &s;trongly of their in&s;ignificance. They are obliged either to execute the orders of their inferiors, or to &s;ee them&s;elves oppo&s;ed by the na|tural in&s;truments of their office. With the lo&s;s of their dignity, they lo&s;e their temper. In their turn they grow trouble&s;ome to that cabal, which, whe|ther it &s;upports or oppo&s;es, equally di&s;graces and equally betrays them. It is &s;oon found nece&s;&s;ary to get rid of the heads of admini&s;tration; but it is of the heads only. As there always are many rotten members belonging to the be&s;t connexions, it is not hard to per&s;uade &s;everal to continue in office without their leaders. By this means the party goes out much thinner than it came in; and is only reduced in &s;trength by its temporary po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of power. Be&s;ides, if by accident, or in cour&s;e of changes, that power &s;hould be recovered, the junto have thrown up a retrenchment of the&s;e carca&s;es, which may &s;erve to cover them&s;elves in a day of danger. They conclude, not unwi&s;ely, that &s;uch rotten members will become the fir&s;t objects of di&s;gu&s;t and re&s;entment to their antient connexions.</P>
<P>THEY contrive to form in the outward admi|ni&s;tration two parties at the lea&s;t; which, whil&s;t they are tearing one another to pieces, are both competitors for the favour and protection of the
<PB N="187" REF="188">
cabal; and, by their emulation, contribute to throw every thing more and more into the hands of the interior managers.</P>
<P>A MINISTER of &s;tate will &s;ometimes keep him|&s;elf totally e&s;tranged from all his colleagues; will differ from them in their councils, will privately traver&s;e, and publicly oppo&s;e, their mea&s;ures. He will, however, continue in his employment. In|&s;tead of &s;uffering any mark of di&s;plea&s;ure, he will be di&s;tingui&s;hed by an unbounded profu&s;ion of court rewards and care&s;&s;es; becau&s;e he does what is expected, and all that is expected, from men in office. He helps to keep &s;ome form of admini&s;tra|tion in being, and keeps it at the &s;ame time as weak and divided as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, we mu&s;t take care not to be mi&s;|taken, or to imagine that &s;uch per&s;ons have any weight in their oppo&s;ition. When, by them, ad|mini&s;tration is convinced of its in&s;ignificancy, they are &s;oon to be convinced of their own. They never are &s;uffered to &s;ucceed in their oppo&s;ition. They and the world are to be &s;atisfied, that, nei|ther office, nor authority, nor property, nor abi|lity, eloquence, council, &s;kill, or union, are of the lea&s;t importance; but that the mere influence of the court, naked of all &s;upport, and de&s;titute of all management, is abundantly &s;ufficient for all its own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>WHEN any adver&s;e connexion is to be de&s;troyed, the cabal &s;eldom appear in the work them&s;elves. They find out &s;ome per&s;on of whom the party en|tertains an high opinion. Such a per&s;on they en|deavour to delude with various pretences. They teach him fir&s;t to di&s;tru&s;t, and then to quarrel with his friends; among whom, by the &s;ame arts, they excite a &s;imilar diffidence of him; &s;o that, in this
<PB N="188" REF="189">
mutual fear and di&s;tru&s;t, he may &s;uffer him&s;elf to be employed as the in&s;trument in the change which is brought about. Afterwards they are &s;ure to de|&s;troy him in his turn; by &s;etting up in his place &s;ome per&s;on in whom he had him&s;elf repo&s;ed the greate&s;t confidence, and who &s;erves to carry off a con&s;iderable part of his adherents.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;uch a per&s;on has broke in this manner with his connexions, he is &s;oon compelled to commit &s;ome flagrant act of iniquitous per&s;onal ho&s;tility again&s;t &s;ome of them (&s;uch as an attempt to &s;trip a particular friend of his family e&s;tate), by which the cabal hope to render the parties utterly irreconcila|ble. In truth, they have &s;o contrived matters, that people have a greater hatred to the &s;ubordinate in|&s;truments than to the principal movers.</P>
<P>AS in de&s;troying their enemies they make u&s;e of in&s;truments not immediately belonging to their corps, &s;o in advancing their own friends they pur&s;ue exactly the &s;ame method. To promote any of them to con&s;iderable rank or emolument, they commonly take care that the recommendation &s;hall pa&s;s through the hands of the o&s;ten&s;ible mini&s;try: &s;uch a recommendation might however appear to the world, as &s;ome proof of the credit of mini&s;ters, and &s;ome means of increa&s;ing their &s;trength. To prevent this, the per&s;ons &s;o advanced are directed, in all companies, indu&s;triou&s;ly to declare, that they are under no obligations what&s;oever to admini&s;tra|tion; that they have received their office from ano|ther quarter; that they are totally free and inde|pendent.</P>
<P>WHEN the faction has any job of lucre to obtain, or of vengeance to perpetrate, their way is, to &s;e|lect, for the execution, tho&s;e very per&s;ons to who&s;e habits, friend&s;hips, principles, and declarations, &s;uch
<PB N="189" REF="190">
proceedings are publicly known to be the mo&s;t adver&s;e; at once to render the in&s;truments the more odious, and therefore the more dependent, and to prevent the people from ever repo&s;ing a con|fidence in any appearance of private friend&s;hip, or public principle.</P>
<P>IF the admini&s;tration &s;eem now and then, from remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, or from fear of making them&s;elves di&s;agreeable, to &s;uffer any popular exce&s;&s;es to go unpuni&s;hed, the cabal immediately &s;ets up &s;ome creature of theirs to rai&s;e a clamour again&s;t the mi|ni&s;ters, as having &s;hamefully betrayed the dignity of government. Then they compel the mini&s;try to become active in conferring rewards and ho|nours on the per&s;ons who have been the in&s;truments of their di&s;grace; and, after having fir&s;t vilified them with the higher orders for &s;uffering the laws to &s;leep over the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the populace, they drive them (in order to make amends for their former in|activity) to &s;ome act of atrocious violence, which renders them completely abhorred by the people. They who remember the riots which attended the Middle&s;ex election; the opening of the pre&s;ent par|liament; and the tran&s;action relative to Saint George's Fields, will not be at a lo&s;s for an appli|cation of the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>THAT this body may be enabled to compa&s;s all the ends of its in&s;titution, its members are &s;carcely ever to aim at the high and re&s;pon&s;ible offices of the &s;tate. They are di&s;tributed with art and judgment through all the &s;econdary, but efficient, depart|ments of office, and through the hou&s;eholds of all the branches of the royal family: &s;o as on one hand to occupy all the avenues to the throne; and on the other to forward or fru&s;trate the execution of any mea&s;ure, according to their own intere&s;ts. For with the credit and &s;upport which they are known to
<PB N="190" REF="191">
have, though for the greater part in places which are only a genteel excu&s;e for &s;alary, they po&s;&s;e&s;s all the influence of the highe&s;t po&s;ts; and they dictate publicly in almo&s;t every thing, even with a parade of &s;uperiority. Whenever they di&s;&s;ent (as it often happens) from their nominal leaders, the trained part of the &s;enate, in&s;tinctively in the &s;ecret, is &s;ure to follow them; provided the leaders, &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ituation, do not of them&s;elves recede in time from their mo&s;t declared opinions. This latter is generally the ca&s;e. It will not be conceivable to any one who has not &s;een it, what plea&s;ure is taken by the cabal in rendering the&s;e heads of office tho|roughly contemptible and ridiculous. And when they are become &s;o, they have then the be&s;t chance for being well &s;upported.</P>
<P>THE members of the court faction are fully in|demnified for not holding places on the &s;lippery heights of the kingdom, not only by the lead in all affairs, but al&s;o by the perfect &s;ecurity in which they enjoy le&s;s con&s;picuous, but very advantageous &s;itu|ations. Their places are, in expre&s;s legal tenure, or in effect, all of them for life. Whil&s;t the fir&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;ons in the kingdom are to&s;&s;ed about like tennis balls, the &s;port of a blind and in&s;olent caprice, no mini&s;ter dares even to ca&s;t an oblique glance at the lowe&s;t of their body. If an attempt be made upon one of this corps, imme|diately he flies to &s;anctuary, and pretends to the mo&s;t inviolable of all promi&s;es. No conveniency of public arrangement is available to remove any one of them from the &s;pecific &s;ituation he holds; and the &s;lighte&s;t attempt upon one of them, by the mo&s;t powerful mini&s;ter, is a certain preliminary to his own de&s;truction.</P>
<P>CONSCIOUS of their independence, they bear them&s;elves with a lofty air to the exterior mini&s;ters.
<PB N="191" REF="192">
Like Jani&s;&s;aries, they derive a kind of freedom from the very condition of their &s;ervitude. They may act ju&s;t as they plea&s;e; provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their in&s;titution. It is, therefore, not at all wonderful, that people &s;hould be &s;o de&s;irous of adding them&s;elves to that body, in which they may po&s;&s;e&s;s and reconcile &s;atisfactions the mo&s;t alluring, and &s;eemingly the mo&s;t contra|dictory; enjoying at once all the &s;pirited plea&s;ure of independence, and all the gro&s;s lucre and fat emo|luments of &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>HERE is a &s;ketch, though a &s;light one, of the con&s;titution, laws, and policy, of this new court corporation. The name by which they chu&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, is that of <HI>King's men,</HI> or the <HI>King's friends,</HI> by an invidious exclu&s;ion of the re&s;t of his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t loyal and affectionate &s;ub|jects. The whole &s;y&s;tem, comprehending the ex|terior and interior admini&s;trations, is commonly called, in the technical language of the court, <HI>Double Cabinet</HI>; in French or Engli&s;h, as you choo&s;e to pronounce it.</P>
<P>WHETHER all this be a vi&s;ion of a di&s;tracted brain, or the invention of a malicious heart, or a real faction in the country, mu&s;t be judged by the appearances which things have worn for eight years pa&s;t. Thus far I am certain, that there is not a &s;ingle public man, in or out of office, who has not, at &s;ome time or other, born te&s;timony to the truth of what I have now related. In particular, no per|&s;ons have been more &s;trong in their a&s;&s;ertions, and louder and more indecent in their complaints, than tho&s;e who compo&s;e all the exterior part of the pre|&s;ent admini&s;tration; in who&s;e time that faction has arrived at &s;uch an height of power, and of boldne&s;s in the u&s;e of it, as may, in the end, perhaps bring about its total de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">IT is true, that about four years ago, during the admini&s;tration of the marquis of Rockingham, an attempt was made to carry on government without their concurrence. However, this was only a tran|&s;ient cloud; they were hid but for a moment; and their con&s;tellation blazed out with greater bright|ne&s;s, and a far more vigorous influence, &s;ome time after it was blown over. An attempt was at that time made (but without any idea of pro&s;cription) to break their corps, to di&s;countenance their doctrines, to revive connexions of a different kind, to re&s;tore the principles and policy of the whigs, to re-animate the cau&s;e of liberty by mini&s;terial countenance; and then for the fir&s;t time were men &s;een attached in office to every principle they had maintained in op|po&s;ition. No one will doubt, that &s;uch men were abhorred and violently oppo&s;ed by the court facti|on, and that &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem could have but a &s;hort duration.</P>
<P>IT may appear &s;omewhat affected, that in &s;o much di&s;cour&s;e upon this extraordinary party, I &s;hould &s;ay &s;o little of the earl of Bute, who is the &s;uppo&s;ed head of it. But this was neither owing to affectation nor inadvertence. I have carefully avoided the introduction of per&s;onal reflections of any kind. Much the greater part of the topics which have been u&s;ed to blacken this nobleman, are either unju&s;t or frivolous. At be&s;t, they have a tendency to give the re&s;entment of this bitter ca|lamity a wrong direction, and to turn a public grievance into a mean per&s;onal, or a dangerous national quarrel. Where there is a regular &s;cheme of operations carried on, it is the &s;y&s;tem, and not any individual per&s;on who acts in it, that is truly dangerous. This &s;y&s;tem has not ri&s;en &s;olely from the ambition of lord Bute; but from the circum|&s;tances which favoured it, and from an indifference
<PB N="193" REF="194">
to the con&s;titution which had been for &s;ome time growing among our gentry. We &s;hould have been tried with it, if the earl of Bute had never exi&s;ted; and it will want neither a contriving head nor active members, when the earl of Bute exi&s;ts no longer. It is not, therefore, to rail at lord Bute, but firmly to embody again&s;t this court party and its practices, which can afford us any pro&s;pect of relief in our pre&s;ent condition.</P>
<P>ANOTHER motive induces me to put the per|&s;onal con&s;ideration of lord Bute, wholly out of the que&s;tion. He communicates very little in a direct manner with the greater part of our men of bu&s;i|ne&s;s. This has never been his cu&s;tom. It is enough for him that he &s;urrounds them with his creatures. Several imagine, therefore, that they have a very good excu&s;e for doing all the work of this faction, when they have no per&s;onal connexion with lord Bute. But whoever becomes a party to an admini|&s;tration, compo&s;ed of in&s;ulated individuals, without faith plighted, tie, or common principle; an ad|mini&s;tration con&s;titutionally impotent, becau&s;e &s;up|ported by no party in the nation; he who contri|butes to de&s;troy the connexions of men and their tru&s;t in one another, or in any &s;ort to throw the dependence of public coun&s;els upon private will and favour, po&s;&s;ibly may have nothing to do with the earl of Bute. It matters little whether he be the friend or the enemy of that particular per&s;on. But let him be who or what he will, he abets a faction that is driving hard to the ruin of his coun|try. He is &s;apping the foundation of its liberty, di&s;turbing the &s;ources of its dome&s;tic tranquillity, weakening its government over its dependencies, degrading it from all its importance in the &s;y&s;tem of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="195">IT is this unnatural infu&s;ion of a <HI>&s;y&s;tem of fa|vouriti&s;m</HI> into a government which in a great part of its con&s;titution is popular, that has rai&s;ed the pre&s;ent ferment in the nation. The people, with|out entering deeply into its principles, could plainly perceive its effects, in much violence, in a great &s;pirit of innovation, and a general di&s;order in all the functions of government. I keep my eye &s;olely on this &s;y&s;tem; if I &s;peak of tho&s;e mea&s;ures which have ari&s;en from it, it will be &s;o far only as they illu&s;trate the general &s;cheme. This is the fountain of all tho&s;e bitter waters of which, through an hundred different conduits, we have drunk until we are ready to bur&s;t. The di&s;cretionary power of the crown in the formation of mini&s;try, abu&s;ed by bad or weak men, has given ri&s;e to a &s;y&s;tem, which, without directly violating the letter of any law, operates again&s;t the &s;pirit of the whole con&s;titution.</P>
<P>A PLAN of favouriti&s;m for our executory go|vernment is e&s;&s;entially at variance with the plan of our legi&s;lature. One great end undoubtedly of a mixed government like ours, compo&s;ed of mo|narchy, and of controuls, on the part of the higher people, and the lower, is that the prince &s;hall not be able to violate the laws. This is u&s;eful indeed and fundamental. But this, even at fir&s;t view, is no more than a negative advantage; an armour merely defen&s;ive. It is therefore next in order, and equal in importance, <HI>that the di&s;cretionary powers which are nece&s;&s;arily ve&s;ted in the monarch, whether for the execution of the laws, or for the no|mination to magi&s;tracy and office, or for conducting the affairs of peace and war, or for ordering the revenue, &s;hould all be exerci&s;ed upon public principles and na|tional grounds, and not on the likings or prejudices, the intrigues or policies, of a court.</HI> This, I &s;aid, is
<PB N="195" REF="196">
equal in importance to the &s;ecuring a government according to law. The laws reach but a very little way. Con&s;titute government how you plea&s;e, infinitely the greater part of it mu&s;t depend upon the exerci&s;e of the powers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightne&s;s of mini&s;ters of &s;tate. Even all the u&s;e and potency of the laws depends upon them. Without them, your com|monwealth is no better than a &s;cheme upon paper; and not a living, acting, effective con&s;titution. It is po&s;&s;ible, that through negligence, or ignorance, or de&s;ign artfully conducted, mini&s;ters may &s;uffer one part of government to langui&s;h, another to be perverted from its purpo&s;es, and every valuable intere&s;t of the country to fall into ruin and decay, without po&s;&s;ibility of fixing any &s;ingle act on which a criminal pro&s;ecution can be ju&s;tly grounded. The due arrangement of men in the active part of the &s;tate, far from being foreign to the purpo&s;es of a wi&s;e government, ought to be among its very fir&s;t and deare&s;t objects. When, therefore, the abettors of the new &s;y&s;tem tell us, that be|tween them and their oppo&s;ers there is nothing but a &s;truggle for power, and that therefore we are no-ways concerned in it; we mu&s;t tell tho&s;e who have the impudence to in&s;ult us in this manner, that of all things we ought to be the mo&s;t con|cerned, who and what &s;ort of men they are, that hold the tru&s;t of every thing that is dear to us. Nothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation, but what mu&s;t either render us totally de&s;perate, or &s;oothe us into the &s;ecurity of idiots. We mu&s;t &s;often into a credulity below the milkine&s;s of infancy, to think all men virtuous. We mu&s;t be tainted with a malignity truly diabolical, to be|lieve all the world to be equally wicked and cor|rupt. Men are in public life as in private, &s;ome good, &s;ome evil. The elevation of the one, and
<PB N="196" REF="197">
the depre&s;&s;ion of the other, are the fir&s;t objects of all true policy. But that form of government, which, neither in its direct in&s;titutions, nor in their immediate tendency, has contrived to throw its affairs into the mo&s;t tru&s;t-worthy hands, but has left its whole executory &s;y&s;tem to be di&s;po&s;ed of agreeably to the uncontrouled plea&s;ure of any one man, however excellent or virtuous, is a plan of polity defective not only in that member, but con|&s;equentially erroneous in every part of it.</P>
<P>IN arbitrary governments, the con&s;titution of the mini&s;try follows the con&s;titution of the legi&s;la|ture. Both the law and the magi&s;trate are the creatures of will. It mu&s;t be &s;o. Nothing, indeed, will appear more certain, on any tolerable con&s;i|deration of this matter, than that <HI>every &s;ort of go|vernment ought to have its admini&s;tration corre&s;pondent to its legi&s;lature.</HI> If it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, things mu&s;t fall into an hideous di&s;order. The people of a free commonwealth, who have taken &s;uch care that their laws &s;hould be the re&s;ult of general con|&s;ent, cannot be &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s as to &s;uffer their ex|ecutory &s;y&s;tem to be compo&s;ed of per&s;ons on whom they have no dependence, and whom no proofs of the public love and confidence have recommended to tho&s;e powers, upon the u&s;e of which the very being of the &s;tate depends.</P>
<P>THE popular election of magi&s;trates, and po|pular di&s;po&s;ition of rewards and honours, is one of the fir&s;t advantages of a free &s;tate. Without it, or &s;omething equivalent to it, perhaps the people cannot long enjoy the &s;ub&s;tance of freedom; cer|tainly none of the vivifying energy of good go|vernment. The frame of our commonwealth did not admit of &s;uch an actual election: but it pro|vided as well, and (while the &s;pirit of the con&s;titu|tion is pre&s;erved) better for all the effects of it than
<PB N="197" REF="198">
by the method of &s;uffrage in any democratic &s;tate what&s;oever. It had always, until of late, been held the fir&s;t duty of parliament, <HI>to refu&s;e to &s;up|port government, until power was in the hands of per|&s;ons who were acceptable to the people, or while fac|tions predominated in the court in which the nation had no confidence.</HI> Thus all the good effects of popular election were &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ecured to us, without the mi&s;chiefs attending on perpetual intrigue, and a di&s;tinct canva&s;s for every particular office through|out the body of the people. This was the mo&s;t noble and refined part of our con&s;titution. The people, by their repre&s;entatives and grandees, were intru&s;ted with a deliberative power in making laws; the king with the controul of his negative. The king was intru&s;ted with the deliberative choice and the election to office; the people had the nega|tive in a parliamentary refu&s;al to &s;upport. For|merly this power of controul was what kept mi|ni&s;ters in awe of parliaments, and parliaments in reverence with the people. If the u&s;e of this power of controul on the &s;y&s;tem and per&s;ons of admini|&s;tration is gone, every thing is lo&s;t, parliament and all. We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that if parlia|ment will tamely &s;ee evil men take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the &s;trong-holds of their country, and allow them time and means to fortify them&s;elves, under a pretence of giving them a fair trial, and upon a hope of di&s;covering, whether they will not be re|formed by power, and whether their mea&s;ures will not be better than their morals; &s;uch a parliament will give countenance to their mea&s;ures al&s;o, what|ever that parliament may pretend, and whatever tho&s;e mea&s;ures may be.</P>
<P>EVERY good political in&s;titution mu&s;t have a preventive operation as well as a remedial. It ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men
<PB N="198" REF="199">
from government, and not to tru&s;t for the &s;afety of the &s;tate to &s;ub&s;equent puni&s;hment alone: puni&s;h|ment, which has ever been tardy and uncertain; and which, when power is &s;uffered in bad hands, may chance to fall rather on the injured than the criminal.</P>
<P>BEFORE men are put forward into the great tru&s;ts of the &s;tate, they ought by their conduct to have obtained &s;uch a degree of e&s;timation in their country, as may be &s;ome &s;ort of pledge and &s;ecuri|to the public, that they will not abu&s;e tho&s;e tru&s;ts. It is no mean &s;ecurity for a proper u&s;e of power, that a man has &s;hewn by the general tenor of his ac|tions, that the affection, the good opinion, the con|fidence, of his fellow citizens have been among the principal objects of his life; and that he has owed none of the gradations of his power or fortune to a &s;ettled contempt, or occa&s;ional forfeiture of their e&s;teem.</P>
<P>THAT man who before he comes into power has no friends, or who coming into power is obliged to de&s;ert his friends, or who lo&s;ing it has no friends to to &s;ympathize with him; he who has no &s;way among any part of the landed or commercial inte|re&s;t, but who&s;e whole importance has begun with his office, and is &s;ure to end with it; is a per&s;on who ought never to be &s;uffered by a controuling parliament to continue in any of tho&s;e &s;ituations which confer the lead and direction of all our pub|lic affairs; becau&s;e &s;uch a man <HI>has no connexion with the intere&s;t of the people.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE knots or cabals of men who have got to|gether, avowedly without any public principle, in order to &s;ell their conjunct iniquity at the higher rate, and are therefore univer&s;ally odious, ought never to be &s;uffered to domineer in the &s;tate; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="199" REF="200">
they have <HI>no connexion with the &s;entiments and opinions of the people.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are con&s;iderations which in my opinion enforce the nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;ome better rea&s;on, in a free country, and a free parliament, for &s;up|porting the mini&s;ters of the crown, than that &s;hort one, <HI>That the King has thought proper to appoint them.</HI> There is &s;omething very courtly in this. But it is a principle pregnant with all &s;orts of mi&s;chief, in a con&s;titution like ours, to turn the views of active men from the country to the court. Whatever be the road to power, that is the road which will be trod. If the opinion of the country be of no u&s;e as a means of power or con&s;ideration, the qualities which u&s;ually procure that opinion will be no longer cultivated. And whether it will be right, in a &s;tate &s;o popular in its con&s;titution as ours, to leave ambi|tion without popular motives, and to tru&s;t all to the operation of pure virtue in the minds of kings and mini&s;ters, and public men, mu&s;t be &s;ubmitted to the judgment and good &s;en&s;e of the people of Eng|land.</P>
<P>CUNNING men are here apt to break in, and, without directly controverting the principle, to rai&s;e objections from the difficulty under which the &s;ove|reign labours, to di&s;tingui&s;h the genuine voice and &s;entiments of his people, from the clamour of a fac|tion, by which it is &s;o ea&s;ily counterfeited. The nation, they &s;ay, is generally divided into parties, with views and pa&s;&s;ions, utterly irreconcilable. If the king &s;hould put his affairs into the hands of any one of them, he is &s;ure to di&s;gu&s;t the re&s;t; if he &s;e|lect particular men from among them all, it is an hazard that he di&s;gu&s;ts them all. Tho&s;e who are left out, however divided before, will &s;oon run into a body of oppo&s;ition; which, being a collection of many di&s;contents into one focus, will without
<PB N="200" REF="201">
doubt be hot and violent enough. Faction will make its cries re&s;ound through the nation, as if the whole were in an uproar, when by far the majority, and much the better part, will &s;eem for a while as it were annihilated by the quiet in which their virtue and moderation incline them to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of government. Be&s;ides that the opinion of the meer vulgar is a mi&s;erable rule even with regard to them&s;elves, on account of their violence and in&s;ta|bility. So that if you were to gratify them in their humour to-day, that very gratification would be a ground of their di&s;&s;atisfaction on the next. Now as all the&s;e rules of public opinion are to be collect|ed with great difficulty, and to be applied with equal uncertainty as to the effect, what better can a king of England do, than to employ &s;uch men as he finds to have views and inclinations mo&s;t con|formable to his own; who are at lea&s;t infected with pride and &s;elf-will, and who are lea&s;t moved by &s;uch popular humours as are perpetually traver&s;ing his de&s;igns, and di&s;turbing his &s;ervice; tru&s;ting that, when he means no ill to his people, he will be &s;up|ported in his appointments, whether he cho&s;es to keep or to change, as his private judgment or his plea&s;ure leads him? He will find a &s;ure re&s;ource in the real weight and influence of the crown, when it is not &s;uffered to become an in&s;trument in the hands of a faction.</P>
<P>I WILL not pretend to &s;ay that there is nothing at all in this mode of rea&s;oning; becau&s;e I will not a&s;&s;ert, that there is no difficulty in the art of govern|ment. Undoubtedly the very be&s;t admini&s;tration mu&s;t encounter a great deal of oppo&s;ition; and the very wor&s;t will find more &s;upport than it de&s;erves. Sufficient appearances will never be wanting to tho&s;e who have a mind to deceive them&s;elves. It is a fallacy in con&s;tant u&s;e with tho&s;e who would level
<PB N="201" REF="202">
all things, and confound right with wrong, to in&s;i&s;t upon the inconveniencies which are attached to eve|ry choice, without taking into con&s;ideration the dif|ferent weight and con&s;equence of tho&s;e inconveni|encies. The que&s;tion is not concerning <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> di&s;content or <HI>perfect</HI> &s;atisfaction in government; neither of which can be pure and unmixed at any time, or upon any &s;y&s;tem. The controver&s;y is about that degree of good humour in the people, which may po&s;&s;ibly be attained, and ought certain|ly to be looked for. While &s;ome politicians may be waiting to know whether the &s;en&s;e of every in|dividual be again&s;t them, accurately di&s;tingui&s;hing the vulgar from the better &s;ort, drawing lines be|tween the enterprizes of a faction and the efforts of a people, they may chance to &s;ee the government, which they are &s;o nicely weighing, and dividing, and di&s;tingui&s;hing, tumble to the ground in the mid&s;t of their wi&s;e deliberation. Prudent men, when &s;o great an object as the &s;ecurity of govern|ment, or even its peace, is at &s;take, will not run the ri&s;k of a deci&s;ion which may be fatal to it. They who can read the political &s;ky will &s;ee an hurricane in a cloud no bigger than an hand at the very edge of the horizon, and will run into the fir&s;t harbour. No lines can be laid down for civil or political wi&s;|dom. They are a matter incapable of exact defini|tion. But, though no man can draw a &s;troke be|tween the confines of day and night, yet light and darkne&s;s are upon the whole tolerably di&s;tingui&s;ha|ble. Nor will it be impo&s;&s;ible for a prince to find out &s;uch a mode of government, and &s;uch per&s;ons to admini&s;ter it, as will give a great degree of con|tent to his people; without any curious and anxious re&s;earch for that ab&s;tract, univer&s;al, perfect harmo|ny, which while he is &s;eeking, he abandons tho&s;e means of ordinary tranquillity which are in his power without any re&s;earch at all.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="203">IT is not more the duty than it is the intere&s;t of a prince, to aim at giving tranquillity to his govern|ment. But tho&s;e who advi&s;e him may have an in|tere&s;t in di&s;order and confu&s;ion. If the opinion of the people is again&s;t them, they will naturally wi&s;h that it &s;hould have no prevalence. Here it is that the people mu&s;t on their part &s;hew them&s;elves &s;en|&s;ible of their own value. Their whole importance, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and afterwards their whole free|dom, is at &s;take. Their freedom cannot long &s;ur|vive their importance. Here it is that the natural &s;trength of the kingdom, the great peers, the lead|ing landed gentlemen, the opulent merchants and manufacturers, the &s;ub&s;tantial yeomanry, mu&s;t in|terpo&s;e, to re&s;cue their prince, them&s;elves, and their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>WE are at pre&s;ent at i&s;&s;ue upon this point. We are in the great cri&s;is of this contention; and the part which men take one way or other, will &s;erve to di&s;criminate their characters and their principles. Until the matter is decided, the country will remain in its pre&s;ent confu&s;ion. For while a &s;y&s;tem of ad|mini&s;tration is attempted, entirely repugnant to the genius of the people, and not conformable to the plan of their government, every thing mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be di&s;ordered for a time, until this &s;y&s;tem de|&s;troys the con&s;titution, or the con&s;titution gets the the better of this &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>THERE is, in my opinion, a peculiar venom and malignity in this political di&s;temper beyond any that I have heard or read of. In former times the projectors of arbitrary government attacked only the liberties of their country; a de&s;ign &s;urely mi&s;chievous enough to have &s;atisfied a mind of the mo&s;t unruly ambition. But a &s;y&s;tem unfavourable to freedom may be &s;o formed, as con&s;iderably to exalt the grandeur of the &s;tate; and men may find
<PB N="203" REF="204">
in the pride and &s;plendor of that pro&s;perity &s;ome &s;ort of con&s;olation for the lo&s;s of their &s;olid pri|vileges. Indeed the increa&s;e of the power of the &s;tate has often been urged by artful men, as a pre|text for &s;ome abridgment of the public liberty. But the &s;cheme of the junto under con&s;ideration, not only &s;trikes a pal&s;y into every nerve of our free con&s;titution, but in the &s;ame degree benumbs and &s;tupifies the whole executive power; rendering government in all its grand operations languid, un|certain, ineffective; making mini&s;ters fearful of attempting, and incapable of executing, any u&s;e|ful plan of dome&s;tic arrangement, or of foreign po|litics. It tends to produce neither the &s;ecurity of a free government, nor the energy of a monarchy that is ab&s;olute. Accordingly the crown has dwindled away, in proportion to the unnatural and turgid growth of this excre&s;cence on the court.</P>
<P>THE interior mini&s;try are &s;en&s;ible, that war is a &s;ituation which &s;ets in its full light the value of the hearts of a people; and they well know, that the beginning of the importance of the people mu&s;t be the end of theirs. For this rea&s;on they di&s;cover upon all occa&s;ions the utmo&s;t fear of every thing, which by po&s;&s;ibility may lead to &s;uch an event. I do not mean that they manife&s;t any of that pious fear which is backward to commit the &s;afety of the country to the dubious experiment of war. Such a fear, being the tender &s;en&s;ation of virtue, excited, as it is regulated, by rea&s;on, frequently &s;hews it&s;elf in a &s;ea&s;onable boldne&s;s, which keeps danger at a di&s;tance, by &s;eeming to de&s;pi&s;e it. Their fear be|trays to the fir&s;t glance of the eye, its true cau&s;e, and its real object. Foreign powers, confident in the knowledge of their character, have not &s;crupled to violate the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties; and, in defiance
<PB N="204" REF="205">
of them, to make conque&s;ts in the mid&s;t of a ge|neral peace, and in the heart of Europe. Such was the conque&s;t of Cor&s;ica, by the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of the freedom of mankind, in defiance of tho&s;e who were formerly its profe&s;&s;ed defenders. We have had ju&s;t claims upon the &s;ame powers; rights which ought to have been &s;acred to them as well as to us, as they had their origin in our lenity and genero&s;ity towards France and Spain in the day of their great humiliation. Such I call the ran&s;om of Manilla, and the demand on France for the Ea&s;t India pri&s;oners. But the&s;e powers put a ju&s;t con|fidence in their re&s;ource of the <HI>double cabinet.</HI> The&s;e demands (one of them at lea&s;t) are ha&s;tening fa&s;t towards an acquittal by pre&s;cription. Oblivion begins to &s;pread her cobwebs over all our &s;pirited remon&s;trances. Some of the mo&s;t valuable branches of our trade are al&s;o on the point of peri&s;hing from the &s;ame cau&s;e. I do not mean tho&s;e branches which bear without the hand of the vine-dre&s;&s;er; I mean tho&s;e which the policy of treaties had formerly &s;ecured to us; I mean to mark and di&s;tingui&s;h the trade of Portugal, the lo&s;s of which, and the power of the cabal, have one and the &s;ame aera.</P>
<P>IF, by any chance, the mini&s;ters who &s;tand be|fore the curtain po&s;&s;e&s;s or affect any &s;pirit, it makes little or no impre&s;&s;ion. Foreign courts and mi|ni&s;ters, who were among the fir&s;t to di&s;cover and to profit by this invention of the <HI>double cabinet,</HI> at|tend very little to their remon&s;trances. They know that tho&s;e &s;hadows of mini&s;ters have nothing to do in the ultimate di&s;po&s;al of things. Jealou&s;ies and animo&s;ities are &s;edulou&s;ly nouri&s;hed in the outward admini&s;tration, and have been even con&s;idered as a <HI>cau&s;a &s;ine qua non</HI> in its con&s;titution: thence foreign courts have a certainty, that nothing can be done by common coun&s;el in this nation. If one of tho&s;e

mini&s;ters officially takes up a bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;pirit, it &s;erves only the better to &s;ignalize the meanne&s;s of the re&s;t, and the di&s;cord of them all. His collegues in office are in ha&s;te to &s;hake them off, and to di&s;|claim the whole of his proceedings. Of this nature was that a&s;toni&s;hing tran&s;action, in which lord Rochford, our amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, remon&s;trated again&s;t the attempt upon Cor&s;ica, in con&s;equence of a direct authority from lord Shelburne. This re|mon&s;trance the French mini&s;ter treated with the contempt that was natural; as he was a&s;&s;ured, from the amba&s;&s;ador of his court to ours, that the&s;e or|ders of lord Shelburne were not &s;upported by the re&s;t of the (I had like to have &s;aid Briti&s;h) admini|&s;tration. Lord Rochford, a man of &s;pirit, could not endure this &s;ituation. The con&s;equences were, however, curious. He returns from Paris, and comes home full of anger. Lord Shelburne, who gave the orders, is obliged to give up the &s;eals. Lord Rochford, who obeyed the&s;e orders, receives them. He goes, however, into another depart|ment of the &s;ame office, that he might not be obliged officially to acquie&s;ce in one &s;ituation under what he had officially remon&s;trated again&s;t in ano|ther. At Paris, the duke of Choi&s;eul con&s;idered this office arrangement as a compliment to him: here it was &s;poke of as an attention to the delicacy of lord Rochford. But whether the compliment was to one or both, to this nation it was the &s;ame. By this tran&s;action the condition of our court lay expo&s;ed in all its nakedne&s;s. Our office corre|&s;pondence has lo&s;t all pretence to authenticity; Briti&s;h policy is brought into deri&s;ion in tho&s;e na|tions, that a while ago trembled at the power of our arms, whil&s;t they looked up with confidence to the equity, firmne&s;s, and candour, which &s;hone in all our negociations. I repre&s;ent this matter ex|actly

<P>SUCH has been the a&s;pect of our foreign politics, under the influence of a <HI>double cabinet.</HI> With &s;uch an arrangement at court, it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould have been otherwi&s;e. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible that this &s;cheme &s;hould have a better effect upon the go|vernment of our dependencies, the fir&s;t, the deare&s;t, and mo&s;t delicate objects, of the interior policy of this empire. The colonies know, that admini&s;tra|tion is &s;eparated from the court, divided within it|&s;elf, and dete&s;ted by the nation. The <HI>double cabinet</HI> has, in both the parts of it, &s;hewn the mo&s;t malig|nant di&s;po&s;itions towards them, without being able to do them the &s;malle&s;t mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>THEY are convinced, by &s;ufficient experience, that no plan, either of lenity or rigour, can be pur&s;ued with uniformity and per&s;everance. There|fore they turn their eyes entirely from Great Bri|tain, where they have neither dependence on friend&s;hip, nor apprehen&s;ion from enmity. They look to them&s;elves, and their own arrangements. They grow every day into alienation from this country; and whil&s;t they are becoming di&s;con|nected with our government, we have not the con|&s;olation to find, that they are even friendly in their new independence. Nothing can equal the fu|tility, the weakne&s;s, the ra&s;hne&s;s, the timidity, the perpetual contradiction, in the management of our affairs in that part of the world. A volume might be written on this melancholy &s;ubject; but it were better to leave it entirely to the reflexions of the reader him&s;elf than not to treat it in the extent it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>IN what manner our dome&s;tic oeconomy is af|fected by this &s;y&s;tem, it is needle&s;s to explain. It is the perpetual &s;ubject of their own complaints.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="208">THE court party re&s;olve the whole into faction. Having &s;aid &s;omething before upon this &s;ubject, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve here, that when they give this account of the prevalence of faction, they pre&s;ent no very favourable a&s;pect of the confidence of the people in their own government. They may be a&s;|&s;ured, that however they amu&s;e them&s;elves with a variety of projects for &s;ub&s;tituting &s;omething el&s;e in the place of that great and only foundation of go|vernment, the confidence of the people, every at|tempt will but make their condition wor&s;e. When men imagine that their food is only a cover for poi|&s;on, and when they neither love nor tru&s;t the hand that &s;erves it, it is not the name of the roa&s;t beef of old England, that will per&s;uade them to &s;it down to the table that is &s;pread for them. When the people conceive that laws, and tribunals, and even even popular a&s;&s;emblies, are perverted from the ends of their in&s;titution, they find in tho&s;e names of degenerated e&s;tabli&s;hments only new motives to di&s;content. Tho&s;e bodies, which, when full of life and beauty, lay in their arms, and were their joy and comfort, when dead and putrid, become but the more loath&s;ome from remembrance of for|mer endearments. A &s;ullen gloom, and furious di&s;order, prevail by fits; the nation lo&s;es its reli&s;h for peace and pro&s;perity, as it did in that &s;ea&s;on of fulne&s;s which opened our troubles in the time of Charles the fir&s;t. A &s;pecies of men to whom a &s;tate of order would become a &s;entence of ob&s;curity, are nouri&s;hed into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of inte&s;tine di&s;turbances; and it is no wonder that, by a &s;ort of &s;ini&s;ter piety, they cheri&s;h, in their turn, the di&s;orders which are the parents of all their con&s;equence. Superficial ob&s;ervers con&s;ider &s;uch per&s;ons as the cau&s;e of the public unea&s;ine&s;s, when, in truth, they are nothing more than the effect of it. Good men look upon this di&s;tracted &s;cene
<PB N="208" REF="209">
with &s;orrow and indignation. Their hands are tied behind them. They are de&s;poiled of all the power which might enable them to reconcile the &s;trength of government with the rights of the people. They &s;tand in a mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing alternative. But in the election among evils they hope better things from temporary confu&s;ion, than from e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ervi|tude. In the mean time, the voice of law is not to be heard. Fierce licentiou&s;ne&s;s begets violent re&s;traints. The military arm is the &s;ole reliance; and then, call your con&s;titution what you plea&s;e, it is the &s;word that governs. The civil power, like every other that calls in the aid of an ally &s;tronger than it&s;elf, peri&s;hes by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance it receives. But the contrivers of this &s;cheme of government will not tru&s;t &s;olely to the military power; becau&s;e they are cunning men. Their re&s;tle&s;s and crooked &s;pirit drives them to rake in the dirt of every kind of expedient. Unable to rule the multitude, they endeavour to rai&s;e divi&s;ions among&s;t them. One mob is hired to de&s;troy another; a procedure which at once encourages the boldne&s;s of the populace, and ju&s;tly increa&s;es their di&s;content. Men become pen&s;ioners of &s;tate on account of their abilities in the array of riot, and the di&s;cipline of confu&s;ion. Government is put under the di&s;graceful nece&s;&s;ity of protecting from the &s;everity of the laws that very licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which the laws had been before vi|olated to repre&s;s. Every thing partakes of the ori|ginal di&s;order. Anarchy predominates without freedom, and &s;ervitude without &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or &s;ub|ordination. The&s;e are the con&s;equences inevi|table to our public peace, from the &s;cheme of ren|dering the executory government at once odious and feeble; of freeing admini&s;tration from the con|&s;titutional and &s;alutary controul of parliament, and inventing for it a <HI>new controul,</HI> unknown to the con&s;titution, an <HI>interior cabinet</HI>; which brings the
<PB N="209" REF="210">
whole body of government into confu&s;ion and contempt.</P>
<P>AFTER having &s;tated, as &s;hortly as I am able, the effects of this &s;y&s;tem on our foreign affairs, on the policy of our government with regard to our dependencies, and on the interior oeconomy of the commonwealth; there remains only, in this part of my de&s;ign, to &s;ay &s;omething of the grand principle which fir&s;t recommended this &s;y&s;tem at court. The pretence was, to prevent the king from being en|&s;laved by a faction, and made a pri&s;oner in his clo|&s;et. This &s;cheme might have been expected to an&s;wer at lea&s;t its own end, and to indemnify the king, in his per&s;onal capacity, for all the confu&s;ion into which it has thrown his government. But has it in reality an&s;wered this purpo&s;e? I am &s;ure, if it had, every affectionate &s;ubject would have one mo|tive for enduring with patience all the evils which attend it.</P>
<P>IN order to come at the truth in this matter, it may not be ami&s;s to con&s;ider it &s;omewhat in detail. I &s;peak here of the king, and not of the crown; the intere&s;ts of which we have already touched. Inde|pendent of that greatne&s;s which a king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es merely by being a repre&s;entative of the national dignity, the things in which he may have an indi|vidual intere&s;t &s;eem to be the&s;e: wealth accumu|lated; wealth &s;pent in magnificence, plea&s;ure, or beneficence; per&s;onal re&s;pect and attention; and above all, private ea&s;e and repo&s;e of mind. The&s;e compo&s;e the inventory of pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, whether they regard a prince or a &s;ubject; their en|joyments differing only in the &s;cale upon which they are formed.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE then we were to a&s;k, whether the king has been richer than his predece&s;&s;ors in accumulat|ed
<PB N="210" REF="211">
wealth, &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the plan of fa|vouriti&s;m? I believe it will be found that the pic|ture of royal indigence which our court has pre|&s;ented until this year, has been truly humiliating. Nor has it been relieved from this un&s;eemly di&s;tre&s;s, but by means which have hazarded the affection of the people, and &s;haken their confidence in parlia|ment. If the public trea&s;ures had been exhau&s;ted in magnificence and &s;plendour, this di&s;tre&s;s would have been accounted for, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure ju&s;|tified. Nothing would be more unworthy of this nation, than with a mean and mechanical rule, to mete out the &s;plendour of the crown. Indeed I have found very few per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to &s;o ungene|rous a procedure. But the generality of people, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, do feel a good deal mortified, when they compare the wants of the court with its expences. They do not behold the cau&s;e of this di&s;tre&s;s in any part of the apparatus of royal mag|nificence. In all this, they &s;ee nothing but the operations of par&s;imony, attended with all the con|&s;equences of profu&s;ion. Nothing expended, no|thing &s;aved. Their wonder is increa&s;ed by their knowledge, that be&s;ides the revenue &s;ettled on his maje&s;ty's civil li&s;t to the amount of 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, he has a farther aid, from a large pen&s;ion li&s;t, near 90,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, in Ireland; from the produce of the dutchy of Lanca&s;ter (which we are told has been greatly improved); from the revenue of the dutchy of Cornwall; from the American quit-rents; from the four and a half <HI>per cent.</HI> duty in the Lee|ward I&s;lands; this la&s;t worth to be &s;ure con&s;iderably more than 40,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year. The whole is certain|ly not much &s;hort of a million annually.</P>
<P>THESE are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our national councils. We have no direct right to examine into the receipts from his
<PB N="211" REF="212">
maje&s;ty's German dominions, and the bi&s;hopric of O&s;nabrug. This is unque&s;tionably true. But that which is not within the province of parliament, is yet within the &s;phere of every man's own reflection. If a foreign prince re&s;ided among&s;t us, the &s;tate of his revenues could not fail of becoming the &s;ubject of our &s;peculation. Filled with an anxious concern for whatever regards the welfare of our &s;overeign, it is impo&s;&s;ible, in con&s;idering the mi&s;erable circum|&s;tances into which he has been brought, that this obvious topic &s;hould be entirely pa&s;&s;ed over. There is an opinion univer&s;al, that the&s;e revenues produce &s;omething not incon&s;iderable, clear of all charges and e&s;tabli&s;hments. This produce the people do not believe to be hoarded, nor perceive to be &s;pent. It is accounted for in the only manner it can, by &s;uppo&s;ing that it is drawn away, for the &s;upport of that court faction, which, whil&s;t it di&s;tre&s;&s;es the na|tion, impoveri&s;hes the prince in every one of his re|&s;ources. I once more caution the reader, that I do not urge this con&s;ideration concerning the foreign revenue, as if I &s;uppo&s;ed we had a direct right to examine into the expenditure of any part of it; but &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of &s;hewing how little this &s;y&s;|tem of favouriti&s;m has been advantageous to the monarch him&s;elf; which, without magnificence, has &s;unk him into a &s;tate of unnatural poverty; at the &s;ame time that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every means of af|fluence, from ample revenues, both in this country, and in other parts of his dominions.</P>
<P>HAS this &s;y&s;tem provided better for the treat|ment becoming his high and &s;acred character, and &s;ecured the king from tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;ts attached to the nece&s;&s;ity of employing men who are not per&s;onally agreeable? This is a topic upon which for many rea&s;ons I could wi&s;h to be &s;ilent; but the pretence of &s;ecuring again&s;t &s;uch cau&s;es of unea&s;ine&s;s, is the

corner-&s;tone of the court party. It has however &s;o happened, that if I were to fix upon any one point, in which this &s;y&s;tem has been more particularly and &s;hamefully blameable, the effects which it has pro|duced would ju&s;tify me in choo&s;ing for that point its tendency to degrade the per&s;onal dignity of the &s;overeign, and to expo&s;e him to a thou&s;and contra|dictions and mortifications. It is but too evident in what manner the&s;e projectors of royal greatne&s;s have fulfilled all their magnificent promi&s;es. Without recapitulating all the circum&s;tances of the reign, every one of which is more or le&s;s a melancholy proof of the truth of what I have advanced, let us con&s;ider the language of the court but a few years ago, concerning mo&s;t of the per&s;ons now in the ex|ternal admini&s;tration: let me a&s;k, whether any ene|my to the per&s;onal feelings of the &s;overeign, could po&s;&s;ibly contrive a keener in&s;trument of mortificati|on, and degradation of all dignity, than almo&s;t eve|ry part and member of the pre&s;ent arrangement? nor, in the whole cour&s;e of our hi&s;tory, has any compliance with the will of the people ever been known to extort from any prince a greater contra|diction to all his own declared affections and di&s;|likes than that which is now adopted, in direct op|po&s;ition to every thing the people approve and de&s;ire.</P>
<P>AN opinion prevails, that greatne&s;s has been more than once advi&s;ed to &s;ubmit to certain conde|&s;cen&s;ions towards individuals, which have been de|nied to the entreaties of a nation. For the meane&s;t and mo&s;t dependent in&s;trument of this &s;y&s;tem knows, that there are hours when its exi&s;tence may depend upon his adherence to it; and he takes his advantage accordingly. Indeed it is a law of na|ture, that whoever is nece&s;&s;ary to what we have made our object, is &s;ure in &s;ome way, or in &s;ome
<PB N="213" REF="214">
time or other, to become our ma&s;ter. All this how|ever is &s;ubmitted to, in order to avoid that mon&s;|trous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion of the people. For it &s;eems to be laid down as a maxim, that a king has &s;ome &s;ort of intere&s;t in giving unea&s;ine&s;s to his &s;ubjects: that all who are plea&s;ing to them, are to be of cour&s;e di&s;agreeable to him: that as &s;oon as the per&s;ons who are odious at court are known to be odious to the people, it is &s;natched at as a lucky occa&s;ion of &s;howering down upon them all kinds of emoluments and honours. None are con&s;idered as well-wi&s;hers to the crown, but tho&s;e who advi&s;e to &s;ome unpopular cour&s;e of action; none capable of &s;erving it, but tho&s;e who are obliged to call at every in&s;tant upon all its pow|er for the &s;afety of their lives. None are &s;uppo&s;ed to be fit prie&s;ts in the temple of government, but the per&s;ons who are compelled to fly into it for &s;anc|tuary. Such is the effect of this refined project; &s;uch is ever the re&s;ult of all the contrivances which are u&s;ed to free men from the &s;ervitude of their rea&s;on, and from the nece&s;&s;ity of ordering their af|fairs according to their evident intere&s;ts. The&s;e contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous &s;ervitude, in order to avoid a &s;uppo&s;ed re|&s;traint that might be attended with advantage.</P>
<P>IF therefore this &s;y&s;tem has &s;o ill an&s;wered its own grand pretence of &s;aving the king from the nece&s;&s;ity of employing per&s;ons di&s;agreeable to him, has it given more peace and tranquillity to his ma|je&s;ty's private hours? No, mo&s;t certainly. The fa|ther of his people cannot po&s;&s;ibly enjoy repo&s;e, while his family is in &s;uch a &s;tate of di&s;traction. Then what has the crown or the king profited by all this fine-wrought &s;cheme? Is he more rich, or more &s;plendid, or more powerful, or more at his ea&s;e, by &s;o many labours and contrivances? Have

they not beggared his Exchequer, tarni&s;hed the &s;plendour of his court, &s;unk his dignity, galled his feelings, di&s;compo&s;ed the whole order and happi|ne&s;s of his private life?</P>
<P>IT will be very hard, I believe, to &s;tate in what re&s;pect the king has profited by that faction which pre&s;umptuou&s;ly choo&s;e to call them&s;elves <HI>his friends.</HI></P>
<P>IF particular men had grown into an attachment, by the di&s;tingui&s;hed honour of the &s;ociety of their &s;overeign; and, by being the partakers of his amu&s;ements, came &s;ometimes to prefer the gratifi|cation of his per&s;onal inclinations to the &s;upport of his high character, the thing would be very natural, and it would be excu&s;able enough. But the plea|&s;ant part of the &s;tory is, that the&s;e <HI>King's friends</HI> have no more ground for u&s;urping &s;uch a title, than a re&s;ident freeholder in Cumberland or in Cornwall. They are only known to their &s;overeign by ki&s;&s;ing his hand, for the offices, pen&s;ions, and grants, into which they have deceived his benignity. May no &s;torm ever come, which will put the firmne&s;s of their attachment to the proof; and which, in the mid&s;t of confu&s;ions, and terrors, and &s;ufferings, may demon&s;trate the eternal difference between a true and &s;evere friend to the monarchy, and a &s;lip|pery &s;ycophant of the court! <HI>Quantum infido &s;currae di&s;tabit amicus.</HI></P>
<P>SO far I have con&s;idered the effect of the court &s;y&s;tem, chiefly as it operates upon the executive government, on the temper of the people, and on the happine&s;s of the &s;overeign. It remains, that we &s;hould con&s;ider, with a little attention, its ope|ration upon parliament.</P>
<P>PARLIAMENT was indeed the great object of all the&s;e politics, the end at which they aimed, as well as the in&s;trument by which they were to operate.
<PB N="215" REF="216">
But, before parliament could be made &s;ub&s;ervient to a &s;y&s;tem, by which it was to be degraded from the dignity of a national council, into a mere member of the court, it mu&s;t be greatly changed from its original character.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking of this body, I have my eye chiefly on the hou&s;e of commons. I hope I &s;hall be in|dulged in a few ob&s;ervations on the nature and cha|racter of that a&s;&s;embly; not with regard to its <HI>legal form and power,</HI> but to its <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> and to the purpo&s;es it is meant to an&s;wer in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of commons was &s;uppo&s;ed originally to be <HI>no part of the &s;tanding government of this country.</HI> It was con&s;idered as a <HI>controul,</HI> i&s;&s;uing <HI>immediately</HI> from the people, and &s;peedily to be re&s;olved into the ma&s;s from whence it aro&s;e. In this re&s;pect it was in the higher part of government what juries are in the lower. The capacity of a magi&s;trate being tran&s;itory, and that of a citizen permanent, the latter capacity it was hoped would of cour&s;e preponderate in all di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, not only between the people and the &s;tanding authority of the crown, but between the people and the fleet|ing authority of the hou&s;e of commons it&s;elf. It was hoped that, being of a middle nature between &s;ubject and government, they would feel with a more tender and a nearer intere&s;t every thing that concerned the people, than the other remoter and more permanent parts of legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>WHATEVER alterations time and the nece&s;&s;ary accommodation of bu&s;ine&s;s may have introduced, this character can never be &s;u&s;tained, unle&s;s the hou&s;e of commons &s;hall be made to bear &s;ome &s;tamp of the actual di&s;po&s;ition of the people at large. It would (among public misfortunes) be an evil more natural and tolerable, that the hou&s;e
<PB N="216" REF="217">
of commons &s;hould be infected with every epide|mical phren&s;y of the people, as this would indicate &s;ome con&s;anguinity, &s;ome &s;ympathy of nature with their con&s;tituents, than that they &s;hould in all ca&s;es be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings of the people out of doors. By this want of &s;ym|pathy they would cea&s;e to be an hou&s;e of com|mons. For it is not the derivation of the power of that hou&s;e from the people, which makes it in a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e their repre&s;entative. The king is the repre&s;entative of the people; &s;o are the lords; &s;o are the judges. They all are tru&s;tees for the peo|ple, as well as the commons; becau&s;e no power is given for the &s;ole &s;ake of the holder; and although government certainly is an in&s;titution of divine authority, yet its forms, and the per&s;ons who ad|mini&s;ter it, all originate from the people.</P>
<P>A POPULAR origin cannot therefore be the cha|racteri&s;tical di&s;tinction of a popular repre&s;entative. This belongs equally to all parts of government, and in all forms. The virtue, &s;pirit, and e&s;&s;ence of a hou&s;e of commons con&s;i&s;ts in its being the expre&s;s image of the feelings of the nation. It was not in&s;tituted to be a controul <HI>upon</HI> the peo|ple, as of late it has been taught, by a doctrine of the mo&s;t pernicious tendency. It was de&s;igned as a controul <HI>for</HI> the people. Other in&s;titutions have been formed for the purpo&s;e of checking popular exce&s;&s;es; and they are, I apprehend, fully ade|quate to their object. If not, they ought to be made &s;o. The hou&s;e of commons, as it was never intended for the &s;upport of peace and &s;ubordina|tion, is mi&s;erably appointed for that &s;ervice; hav|ing no &s;tronger weapon than its mace, and no better officer than its &s;erjeant at arms, which it can command of its own proper authority. A vigilant and jealous eye over executory and judicial ma|gi&s;tracy;
<PB N="217" REF="218">
an anxious care of public money, an openne&s;s, approaching towards facility, to public complaint: the&s;e &s;eem to be the true characteri&s;tics of an hou&s;e of commons. But an addre&s;&s;ing hou&s;e of commons, and a petitioning nation; an hou&s;e of commons full of confidence, when the nation is plunged in de&s;pair; in the utmo&s;t harmony with mini&s;ters, whom the people regard with the utmo&s;t abhorrence; who vote thanks, when the public opinion calls upon them for impeachments; who are eager to grant, when the general voice de|mands account; who, in all di&s;putes between the people and admini&s;tration, pre&s;ume again&s;t the people; who puni&s;h their di&s;orders, but refu&s;e even to enquire into the provocations to them; this is an unnatural, a mon&s;trous &s;tate of things in this con|&s;titution. Such an a&s;&s;embly may be a great, wi&s;e, aweful &s;enate; but it is not to any popular purpo&s;e an hou&s;e of commons. This change from an im|mediate &s;tate of procuration and delegation to a cour&s;e of acting as from original power, is the way in which all the popular magi&s;tracies in the world have been perverted from their purpo&s;es. It is indeed their greate&s;t and &s;ometimes their in|curable corruption. For there is a material di&s;|tinction between that corruption by which particu|lar points are carried again&s;t rea&s;on, (this is a thing which cannot be prevented by human wi&s;dom, and is of le&s;s con&s;equence) and the corruption of the principle it&s;elf. For then the evil is not accidental, but &s;ettled. The di&s;temper becomes the natural habit.</P>
<P>FOR my part, I &s;hall be compelled to conclude the principle of parliament to be totally corrupted, and therefore its ends entirely defeated, when I &s;ee two &s;ymptoms: fir&s;t, a rule of indi&s;criminate &s;upport to all mini&s;ters; becau&s;e this de&s;troys the
<PB N="218" REF="219">
very end of parliament as a controul, and is a ge|neral previous &s;anction to mi&s;government: and &s;e|condly, the &s;etting up any claims adver&s;e to the right of free election; for this tends to &s;ubvert the legal authority by which the hou&s;e of commons &s;its.</P>
<P>I KNOW that, &s;ince the Revolution, along with many dangerous, many u&s;eful powers of govern|ment have been weakened. It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary to have frequent recour&s;e to the legi&s;lature. Parliaments mu&s;t therefore &s;it every year, and for great part of the year. The dreadful di&s;orders of frequent elections have al&s;o nece&s;&s;itated a &s;epten|nial in&s;tead of a triennial duration. The&s;e circum|&s;tances, I mean the con&s;tant habit of authority, and the unfrequency of elections, have tended very much to draw the hou&s;e of commons to|wards the character of a &s;tanding &s;enate. It is a di&s;order which has ari&s;en from the cure of greater di&s;orders; it has ari&s;en from the extreme difficulty of reconciling liberty under a monarchical govern|ment, with external &s;trength and with internal tranquillity.</P>
<P>IT is very clear that we cannot free our&s;elves entirely from this great inconvenience; but I would not increa&s;e an evil, becau&s;e I was not able to remove it; and becau&s;e it was not in my power to keep the hou&s;e of commons religiou&s;ly true to its fir&s;t principles, I would not argue for carrying it to a total oblivion of them. This has been the great &s;cheme of power in our time. They who will not conform their conduct to the public good, and cannot &s;upport it by the prerogative of the crown, have adopted a new plan. They have to|tally abandoned the &s;hattered and old-fa&s;hioned fortre&s;s of prerogative, and made a lodgement in the &s;trong-hold of parliament it&s;elf. If they have
<PB N="219" REF="220">
any evil de&s;ign to which there is no ordinary legal power commen&s;urate, they bring it into parlia|ment. In parliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the end. In parliament the power of obtaining their object is ab&s;olute; and the &s;afety in the proceeding perfect; no rules to confine, no after reckonings to terrify. Parlia|ment cannot with any great propriety puni&s;h others, for things in which they them&s;elves have been accomplices. Thus the controul of parlia|ment upon the executory power is lo&s;t; becau&s;e parliament is made to partake in every con&s;iderable act of government. <HI>Impeachment, that great guar|dian of the purity of the con&s;titution, is in danger of being lo&s;t, even to the idea of it.</HI></P>
<P>BY this plan &s;everal important ends are an&s;wer|ed to the cabal. If the authority of parliament &s;upports it&s;elf, the credit of every act of govern|ment which they contrive, is &s;aved; but if the act be &s;o very odious that the whole &s;trength of parlia|ment is in&s;ufficient to recommend it, then parlia|ment is it&s;elf di&s;credited; and this di&s;credit in|crea&s;es more and more that indifference to the con&s;titution, which it is the con&s;tant aim of its enemies, by their abu&s;e of parliamentary powers, to render general among the people. Whenever parliament is per&s;uaded to a&s;&s;ume the offices of executive government, it will lo&s;e all the confi|dence, love, and veneration, which it has ever en|joyed whil&s;t it was &s;uppo&s;ed the <HI>corrective and con|troul</HI> of the acting powers of the &s;tate. This would be the event, though its conduct in &s;uch a perver|&s;ion of its functions &s;hould be tolerably ju&s;t and moderate; but if it &s;hould be iniquitous, violent, full of pa&s;&s;ion, and full of faction, it would be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t intolerable of all the modes of tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">FOR a con&s;iderable time this &s;eparation of the repre&s;entatives from their con&s;tituents went on with a &s;ilent progre&s;s; and had tho&s;e, who con|ducted the plan for their total &s;eparation, been per&s;ons of temper and abilities any way equal to the magnitude of their de&s;ign, the &s;ucce&s;s would have been infallible: but by their precipitancy they have laid it open in all its nakedne&s;s; the nation is alarmed at it; and the event may not be plea&s;ant to the contrivers of the &s;cheme. In the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion, the corps called the <HI>king's friends</HI> made an hardy attempt all at once, <HI>to alter the right of election it|&s;elf</HI>; to put it into the power of the hou&s;e of com|mons to di&s;able any per&s;on di&s;agreeable to them from &s;itting in parliament, without any other rule than their own plea&s;ure; to make incapacities, either general for de&s;criptions of men, or particular for individuals; and to take into their body, per|&s;ons who avowedly had never been cho&s;en by the majority of legal electors, nor agreeably to any known rule of law.</P>
<P>THE arguments upon which this claim was founded and combated, are not my bu&s;ine&s;s here. Never has a &s;ubject been more amply and more learnedly handled, nor upon one &s;ide in my opi|nion more &s;atisfactorily; they who are not convinc|ed by what is already written would not receive conviction <HI>though one aro&s;e from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>I TOO have thought on this &s;ubject: but my purpo&s;e here, is only to con&s;ider it as a part of the favourite project of government; to ob&s;erve on the motives which led to it; and to trace its poli|tical con&s;equences.</P>
<P>A VIOLENT rage for the puni&s;hment of Mr. Wilkes was the pretence of the whole. This gen|tleman, by &s;etting him&s;elf &s;trongly in oppo&s;ition
<PB N="221" REF="222">
to the court cabal, had become at once an object of their per&s;ecution, and of the popular favour. The hatred of the court party pur&s;uing, and the countenance of the people protecting him, it very &s;oon became not at all a que&s;tion on the man, but a trial of &s;trength between the two parties. The advantage of the victory in this particular conte&s;t was the pre&s;ent, but not the only, nor by any means the principal, object. Its operation upon the character of the hou&s;e of commons was the great point in view. The point to be gained by the cabal was this; that a precedent &s;hould be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, tending to &s;hew, <HI>That the favour of the people was not &s;o &s;ure a road as the favour of the court even to popular honours and popular tru&s;ts.</HI> A &s;tre|nuous re&s;i&s;tance to every appearance of lawle&s;s power: a &s;pirit of independence carried to &s;ome degree of enthu&s;ia&s;m; an inqui&s;itive character to di&s;cover, and a bold one to di&s;play, every corrup|tion and every error of government; the&s;e are the qualities which recommend a man to a &s;eat in the hou&s;e of commons, in open and merely popular elections. An indolent and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition; a di&s;po&s;ition to think charitably of all the actions of men in power, and to live in a mutual inter|cour&s;e of favours with them; an inclination rather to countenance a &s;trong u&s;e of authority, than to bear any &s;ort of licentiou&s;ne&s;s on the part of the people; the&s;e are unfavourable qualities in an open election for members of parliament.</P>
<P>THE in&s;tinct which carries the people towards the choice of the former, is ju&s;tified by rea&s;on; becau&s;e a man of &s;uch a character, even in its exorbitancies, does not directly contradict the purpo&s;es of a tru&s;t, the end of which is a controul on power. The latter character, even when it is not in its extreme, will execute this tru&s;t but very
<PB N="222" REF="223">
imperfectly; and, if deviating to the lea&s;t exce&s;s, will certainly fru&s;trate in&s;tead of forwarding the purpo&s;es of a controul on government. But when the hou&s;e of commons was to be new modelled, this principle was not only to be changed, but re|ver&s;ed. Whil&s;t any errors committed in &s;upport of power were left to the law, with every advan|tage of favourable con&s;truction, or mitigation, and finally of pardon; all exce&s;&s;es on the &s;ide of li|berty, or in pur&s;uit of popular favour, or in de|fence of popular rights and privileges, were not only to be puni&s;hed by the rigour of the known law, but by a <HI>di&s;cretionary</HI> proceeding which brought on <HI>the lo&s;s of the popular object it&s;elf.</HI> Popularity was to be rendered, if not directly penal, at lea&s;t highly dangerous. The favour of the people might lead even to a di&s;qualification of repre&s;ent|ing them. Their odium might become, &s;trained through the medium of two or three con&s;tructions, the means of &s;itting as the tru&s;tee of all that was dear to them. This is puni&s;hing the offence in the offending part. Until this time, the opinion of the people, through the power of an a&s;&s;embly, &s;till in &s;ome &s;ort popular, led to the greate&s;t ho|nours and emoluments in the gift of the crown. Now the principle is rever&s;ed; and the favour of the court is the only &s;ure way of obtaining and holding tho&s;e honours which ought to be in the di&s;po&s;al of the people.</P>
<P>IT &s;ignifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away. Example, the only argument of effect in civil life, demon&s;trates the truth of my propo&s;ition. Nothing can alter my opinion con|cerning the pernicious tendency of this example, until I &s;ee &s;ome man for his indi&s;cretion in the &s;up|port of power, for his violent and intemperate &s;er|vility, rendered incapable of &s;itting in parliament.

<P>NOT that I would encourage popular di&s;order, or any di&s;order. But I would leave &s;uch offences to the law, to be puni&s;hed in mea&s;ure and propor|tion. The laws of this country are for the mo&s;t part con&s;tituted, and wi&s;ely &s;o, for the general ends of government, rather than for the pre&s;erva|tion of our particular liberties. Whatever therefore is done in &s;upport of liberty, by per&s;ons not in public tru&s;t, or not acting merely in that tru&s;t, is liable to be more or le&s;s out of the ordinary cour&s;e of the law; and the law it&s;elf is &s;ufficient to ani|madvert upon it with great &s;everity. Nothing in|deed can hinder that &s;evere letter from cru&s;hing us, except the temperaments it may receive from a trial by jury. But if the habit prevails of <HI>going be|yond the law,</HI> and &s;uper&s;eding this judicature, of carrying offences, real or &s;uppo&s;ed, into the legi&s;|lative bodies, who &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves into <HI>courts of criminal equity</HI> (&s;o the <HI>Star Chamber</HI> has been called by lord Bacon), all the evils of the <HI>Star Cham|ber</HI> are revived. A large and liberal con&s;truction in a&s;certaining offences, and a di&s;cretionary power in puni&s;hing them, is the idea of <HI>criminal equity</HI>; which is in truth a mon&s;ter in juri&s;prudence. It &s;ignifies nothing whether a court for this purpo&s;e be a committee of council, or an hou&s;e of commons, or an hou&s;e of lords; the liberty of the &s;ubject will be equally &s;ubverted by it. The true end and pur|po&s;e of that hou&s;e of parliament which entertains &s;uch a juri&s;diction will be de&s;troyed by it.</P>

Add but the crime of &s;ervility (the <HI>foedum crimen &s;ervitutis</HI>) to every other crime, and the whole ma&s;s is immediately tran&s;|muted into virtue, and becomes the ju&s;t &s;ubject of reward and honour. When therefore I reflect upon this method pur&s;ued by the cabal in di&s;tributing
<PB N="225" REF="226">
rewards and puni&s;hments, I mu&s;t conclude that Mr. Wilkes is the object of per&s;ecution, not on account of what he has done in common with others who are the objects of reward, but for that in which he differs from many of them: that he is pur&s;ued for the &s;pirited di&s;po&s;itions which are blend|ed with his vices; for his unconquerable firmne&s;s, for his re&s;olute, indefatigable, &s;trenuous re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e, therefore, it was not the man that was to be puni&s;hed, nor his faults that were to be di&s;countenanced. Oppo&s;ition to acts of power was to be marked by a kind of civil pro&s;cription. The popularity which &s;hould ari&s;e from &s;uch an oppo&s;i|tion was to be &s;hewn unable to protect it. The qualities by which court is made to the people, were to render every fault inexpiable, and every error irretrievable. The qualities by which court is made to power, were to cover and to &s;anctify every thing. He that will have a &s;ure and ho|nourable &s;eat in the hou&s;e of commons, mu&s;t take care how he adventures to cultivate popular qua|lities; otherwi&s;e he may remember the old maxim, <HI>Breves et infau&s;tos populi Romani amores.</HI> If, there|fore, a pur&s;uit of popularity expo&s;e a man to greater dangers than a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ervility, the principle which is the life and &s;oul of popular elections will peri&s;h out of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IT behoves the people of England to con&s;ider how the hou&s;e of commons under the operation of the&s;e examples mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be con&s;tituted. On the &s;ide of the court will be, all honours; offices, emoluments; every &s;ort of per&s;onal gra|tification to avarice or vanity; and, what is of more moment to mo&s;t gentlemen, the means of growing, by innumerable petty &s;ervices to indi|viduals, into a &s;preading intere&s;t in their country.
<PB N="226" REF="227">
On the other hand, let us &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on uncon|nected with the court, and in oppo&s;ition to its &s;y&s;tem. For his own per&s;on, no office, or emolu|ment, or title; no promotion, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or civil, or military, or naval, for children, or bro|thers, or kindred. In vain an expiring intere&s;t in a borough calls for offices, or &s;mall livings, for the children of mayors, and aldermen, and capital burge&s;&s;es. His court rival has them all. He can do an infinite number of acts of genero&s;ity and kindne&s;s, and even of public &s;pirit. He can pro|cure indemnity from quarters. He can procure ad|vantages in trade. He can get pardons for offences. He can obtain a thou&s;and favours, and avert a thou&s;and evils. He may, while he betrays every valuable intere&s;t of the kingdom, be a benefactor, a patron, a father, a guardian angel, to his bo|rough. The unfortunate independent member has nothing to offer but har&s;h refu&s;al, or pitiful excu&s;e, or de&s;pondent repre&s;entation of an hopele&s;s intere&s;t. Except from his private fortune, in which he may be equalled, perhaps exceeded, by his court com|petitor, he has no way of &s;hewing any one good quality, or of making a &s;ingle friend. In the hou&s;e, he votes for ever in a di&s;pirited minority. If he &s;peaks, the doors are locked. A body of loqua|cious place-men go out to tell the world, that all he aims at, is to get into office. If he has not the ta|lent of elocution, which is the ca&s;e of many as wi&s;e and knowing men as any in the hou&s;e, he is liable to all the&s;e inconveniencies, without the eclat which attends upon any tolerably &s;ucce&s;sful exertion of eloquence. Can we receive a more di&s;couraging po&s;t of duty than this? Strip it of the poor reward of popularity; &s;uffer even the exce&s;&s;es committed in defence of the popular intere&s;t, to become a ground for the majority of that hou&s;e to form a di&s;qualification out of the line of the law, and at

their plea&s;ure, attended not only with the lo&s;s of the franchi&s;e, but with every kind of per&s;onal di&s;|grace.&mdash;If this &s;hall happen, the people of this kingdom may be a&s;&s;ured that they cannot be firmly or faithfully &s;erved by any man. It is out of the nature of men and things that they &s;hould; and their pre&s;umption will be equal to their folly, if they expect it. The power of the people, within the laws, mu&s;t &s;hew it&s;elf &s;ufficient to protect every repre&s;entative in the animated performance of his duty, or that duty cannot be performed. The hou&s;e of commons can never be a controul on other parts of government unle&s;s they are con|trouled them&s;elves by their con&s;tituents; and un|le&s;s the&s;e con&s;tituents po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome right in the choice of that hou&s;e, which it is not in the power of that hou&s;e to take away. If they &s;uffer this power of arbitrary incapacitation to &s;tand, they have ut|terly perverted every other power of the hou&s;e of commons. The late proceeding, I will not &s;ay, <HI>is</HI> contrary to law; it <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o; for the power which is claimed cannot, by any po&s;&s;ibility, be a legal power in any limited member of govern|ment.</P>
<P>THE power which they claim, of declaring in|capacities, would not be above the ju&s;t claims of a final judicature, if they had not laid it down as a leading principle, that they had no rule in the exerci&s;e of this claim, but their own <HI>di&s;cretion.</HI> Not one of their abettors has ever undertaken to a&s;&s;ign the principle of unfitne&s;s, the &s;pecies or degree of delinquency, on which the hou&s;e of commons will expel, nor the mode of proceeding upon it, nor the evidence upon which it is e&s;tabli&s;hed. The direct con&s;equence of which is, that the fir&s;t fran|chi&s;e of an Engli&s;hman, and that on which all the re&s;t vitally depend, is to be forfeited for &s;ome
<PB N="228" REF="229">
offence which no man knows, and which is to be proved by no known rule what&s;oever of legal evi|dence. This is &s;o anomalous to our whole con&s;ti|tution, that I will venture to &s;ay, the mo&s;t trivial right which the &s;ubject claims, never was, nor can be, forfeited in &s;uch a manner.</P>
<P>THE whole of their u&s;urpation is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon this method of arguing. We do not <HI>make</HI> laws. No; we do not contend for this power. We only <HI>declare</HI> law; and, as we are a tribunal both competent and &s;upreme, what we declare to be law becomes law, although it &s;hould not have been &s;o before. Thus the circum&s;tance of having no <HI>appeal</HI> from their juri&s;diction is made to imply that they have no <HI>rule</HI> in the exerci&s;e of it; the judgment does not derive its validity from its con|formity to the law; but prepo&s;terou&s;ly the law is made to attend on the judgment; and the rule of the judgment is no other than the <HI>occa&s;ional will of the hou&s;e.</HI> An arbitrary di&s;cretion leads, legality follows; which is ju&s;t the very nature and de|&s;cription of a legi&s;lative act.</P>
<P>THIS claim in their hands was no barren theory. It was pur&s;ued into its utmo&s;t con&s;equences; and a dangerous principle has begot a corre&s;pondent practice. A &s;y&s;tematic &s;pirit has been &s;hewn upon both &s;ides. The electors of Middle&s;ex cho&s;e a per&s;on whom the hou&s;e of commons had voted incapable; and the hou&s;e of commons has taken in a member whom the electors of Middle&s;ex had not cho&s;en. By a con&s;truction on that legi&s;lative power which had been a&s;&s;umed, they declared that the true legal &s;en&s;e of the county was con|tained in the minority, on that occa&s;ion; and might, on a re&s;i&s;tance to a vote of incapacity, be contained in any minority.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="230">WHEN any con&s;truction of law goes again&s;t the &s;pirit of the privilege it was meant to &s;upport, it is a vicious con&s;truction. It is material to us to be repre&s;ented really and <HI>bona fide,</HI> and not in Forms, in types, and &s;hadows, and fictions of law. The right of election was not e&s;tabli&s;hed merely as a <HI>matter of form,</HI> to &s;atisfy &s;ome method and rule of technical rea&s;oning; it was not a principle which might &s;ub&s;titute a <HI>Titius</HI> or a <HI>Maevius,</HI> a <HI>John Doe</HI> or <HI>Richard Roe,</HI> in the place of a man &s;pecially cho&s;en; not a principle which was ju&s;t as well &s;atisfied with one man as with another. It is a right, the effect of which is to give to the peo|ple, that man, and <HI>that man only,</HI> whom by their voices, actually, not con&s;tructively given, they declare that they know, e&s;teem, love, and tru&s;t. This right is a matter within their own power of judging and feeling; not an <HI>ens rationis</HI> and crea|ture of law: nor can tho&s;e devices, by which any thing el&s;e is &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of &s;uch an actual choice, an&s;wer in the lea&s;t degree the end of repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>I KNOW that the courts of law have made as &s;trained con&s;tructions in other ca&s;es. Such is the con&s;truction in common recoveries. The method of con&s;truction which in that ca&s;e gives to the per&s;ons in remainder, for their &s;ecurity and repre|&s;entative, the door-keeper, cryer, or &s;weeper of the court, or &s;ome other &s;hadowy being without &s;ub&s;tance or effect, is a fiction of a very coar&s;e texture. This was however &s;uffered, by the ac|quie&s;cence of the whole kingdom, for ages; be|cau&s;e the eva&s;ion of the old &s;tatute of We&s;tmin&s;ter, which authori&s;ed perpetuities, had more &s;en&s;e and utility than the law which was evaded. But an attempt to turn the right of election into &s;uch a farce and mockery as a fictitious fine and recovery,
<PB N="230" REF="231">
will, I hope, have another fate; becau&s;e the laws which give it are infinitely dear to us, and the eva&s;ion is infinitely contemptible.</P>
<P>THE people indeed have been told, that this power of di&s;cretionary di&s;qualification is ve&s;ted in hands that they may tru&s;t, and who will be &s;ure not to abu&s;e it to their prejudice. Until I find &s;omething in this argument differing from that on which every mode of de&s;poti&s;m has been defended, I &s;hall not be inclined to pay it any great compli|ment. The people are &s;atisfied to tru&s;t them&s;elves with the exerci&s;e of their own privileges, and do not de&s;ire this kind intervention of the hou&s;e of commons to free them from the burthen. They are certainly in the right. They ought not to tru&s;t the hou&s;e of commons with a power over their fran|chi&s;es: becau&s;e the con&s;titution, which placed two other co-ordinate powers to controul it, repo&s;ed no &s;uch confidence in that body, It were a folly well de&s;erving &s;ervitude for its puni&s;hment, to be full of confidence where the laws are full of di&s;tru&s;t; and to give to an hou&s;e of commons, arrogating to its &s;ole re&s;olution the mo&s;t har&s;h and odious part of legi&s;lative authority, that degree of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which is due only to the legi&s;lature it&s;elf.</P>
<P>WHEN the hou&s;e of commons, in an endeavour to obtain new advantages at the expence of the other orders of the &s;tate, for the benefit of the <HI>commons at large,</HI> have pur&s;ued &s;trong mea&s;ures; if it were not ju&s;t, it was at lea&s;t natural, that the con&s;tituents &s;hould connive at all their proceed|ings; becau&s;e we were our&s;elves ultimately to profit. But when this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is urged to us, in a conte&s;t between the repre&s;entatives and our|&s;elves, and where nothing can be put into their &s;cale which is not taken from ours, they fancy us to be children when they tell us they are our re|pre&s;entatives,
<PB N="231" REF="232">
our own fle&s;h and blood, and that all the &s;tripes they give us are for our good. The very de&s;ire of that body to have &s;uch a tru&s;t con|trary to law repo&s;ed in them, &s;hews that they are not worthy of it. They certainly will abu&s;e it; becau&s;e all men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an uncontrouled di&s;|cretionary power leading to the aggrandi&s;ement and profit of their own body have always abu&s;ed it: and I &s;ee no particular &s;anctity in our times, that is at all likely, by a miraculous operation, to over|rule the cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t purpo&s;ely &s;hut our eyes, if we con&s;ider this matter merely as a conte&s;t between the hou&s;e of commons and the electors. The true conte&s;t is between the electors of the kingdom and the crown; the crown acting by an in&s;trumental hou&s;e of commons. It is preci&s;ely the &s;ame, whe|ther the mini&s;ters of the crown can di&s;qualify by a dependent hou&s;e of commons, or by a dependent court of <HI>&s;tar chamber,</HI> or by a dependent court of king's bench. If once members of parliament can be practically convinced, that they do not depend on the affection or opinion of the people for their political being, they will give them&s;elves over, without even an appearance of re&s;erve, to the influ|ence of the court.</P>
<P>INDEED, a parliament unconnected with the people, is e&s;&s;ential to a mini&s;try unconnected with the people; and therefore tho&s;e who &s;aw through what mighty difficulties the interior mini&s;try waded, and the exterior were dragged, in this bu&s;ine&s;s, will conceive of what prodigious importance, the new corps of <HI>king's men</HI> held this principle of occa|&s;ional and per&s;onal incapacitation, to the whole body of their de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="233">WHEN the hou&s;e of commons was thus made to con&s;ider it&s;elf as the ma&s;ter of its con&s;tituents, there wanted but one thing to &s;ecure that hou&s;e again&s;t all po&s;&s;ible future deviation towards popularity; an <HI>unlimited</HI> fund of money to be laid out according to the plea&s;ure of the court.</P>
<P>TO compleat the &s;cheme of bringing our court to a re&s;emblance to the neighbouring monarchies, it was nece&s;&s;ary, in effect, to de&s;troy tho&s;e appro|priations of revenue, which &s;eem to limit the pro|perty, as the other laws had done the powers, of the crown. An opportunity for this purpo&s;e was taken, upon an application to parliament for pay|ment of the debts of the civil li&s;t; which in 1769 had amounted to 513,000 <HI>l.</HI> Such application had been made upon former occa&s;ions; but to do it in the former manner would by no means an&s;wer the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>WHENEVER the crown had come to the com|mons to de&s;ire a &s;upply for the di&s;charging of debts due on the civil li&s;t; it was always a&s;ked and grant|ed with one of the three following qualifications; &s;ometimes with all of them. Either it was &s;tated, that the revenue had been diverted from its pur|po&s;es by parliament: or that tho&s;e duties had fallen &s;hort of the &s;um for which they were given by parliament, and that the intention of the legi&s;lature had not been fulfilled: or that the money required to di&s;charge the civil li&s;t debt, was to be rai&s;ed chargeable on the civil li&s;t duties. In the reign of queen Anne, the crown was found in debt. The le&s;&s;ening and granting away &s;ome part of her re|venue by parliament was alleged as the cau&s;e of that debt, and pleaded as an equitable ground, &s;uch it certainly was, for di&s;charging it. It does not appear that the duties which were then applied to the ordinary government produced clear above
<PB N="233" REF="234">
580,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year; becau&s;e, when they were after|wards granted to George the fir&s;t, 120,000 <HI>l.</HI> was added, to complete the whole to 700,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year. Indeed it was then a&s;&s;erted, and, I have no doubt, truly, that for many years the net produce did not amount to above 550,000 <HI>l.</HI> The queen's extra|ordinary charges were be&s;ides very con&s;iderable; equal, at lea&s;t, to any we have known in our time. The application to parliament was not for an ab|&s;olute grant of money; but to empower the queen to rai&s;e it by borrowing upon the civil li&s;t funds.</P>
<P>THE civil li&s;t debt was twice paid in the reign of George the fir&s;t. The money was granted upon the &s;ame plan which had been followed in the reign of queen Anne. The civil li&s;t revenues were then mortgaged for the &s;um to be rai&s;ed, and &s;tood charged with the ran&s;om of their own deliverance.</P>
<P>GEORGE the &s;econd received an addition to his ci|vil li&s;t. Duties were granted for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;|ing 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year. It was not until he had reign|ed nineteen years, and after the la&s;t rebellion, that he called upon parliament for a di&s;charge of the civil li&s;t debt. The extraordinary charges brought on by the rebellion, account fully for the nece&s;&s;ities of the crown. However, the extraordinary charges of government were not thought a ground fit to be relied on.</P>
<P>A DEFICIENCY of the civil li&s;t duties for &s;everal years before, was &s;tated as the principal, if not the &s;ole, ground on which an application to parliament could be ju&s;tified. About this time the produce of the&s;e duties had fallen pretty low; and even upon an average of the whole reign they never produced 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year clear to the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>THAT prince reigned fourteen years afterwards: not only no new demands were made; but with
<PB N="234" REF="235">
&s;o much good order were his revenues and expen|ces regulated, that, although many parts of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the court were upon a larger and more liberal &s;cale than they have been &s;ince, there was a con&s;iderable &s;um in hand, on his decea&s;e, amounting to about 170,000 <HI>l.</HI> applicable to the &s;ervice of the civil li&s;t of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty. So that, if this reign commenced with a greater charge than u&s;ual, there was enough, and more than enough, abundantly to &s;upply all the extraordinary expence. That the civil li&s;t &s;hould have been exceeded in the two former reigns, e&s;pecially in the reign of George the fir&s;t, was not at all &s;urpriz|ing. His revenue was but 700,000 <HI>l.</HI> annually; if it ever produced &s;o much clear. The prodigious and dangerous di&s;affection to the very being of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, and the cau&s;e of a Pretender then powerfully abetted from abroad, produced many demands of an extraordinary nature both abroad and at home. Much management and great ex|pences were nece&s;&s;ary. But the throne of no prince has &s;tood upon more un&s;haken foundations than that of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>TO have exceeded the &s;um given for the civil li&s;t, and to have incurred a debt without &s;pecial au|thority of parliament, was, <HI>prima facie,</HI> a criminal act: as &s;uch, mini&s;ters ought naturally rather to have withdrawn it from the in&s;pection, than to have expo&s;ed it to the &s;crutiny, of parliament. Certainly they ought, of them&s;elves, officiou&s;ly to have come armed with every &s;ort of argument, which, by explaining, could excu&s;e, a matter in it|&s;elf of pre&s;umptive guilt. But the terrors of the hou&s;e of commons are no longer for mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the peculiar character of the hou&s;e of commons, as tru&s;tee of the public pur&s;e, would have led them to call with a punctilious &s;o|licitude
<PB N="235" REF="236">
for every public account, and to have exa|mined into them with the mo&s;t rigorous accuracy.</P>
<P>THE capital u&s;e of an account is, that the reality of the charge, the rea&s;on of incurring it, and the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;charging it, &s;hould all ap|pear antecedent to the payment. No man ever pays fir&s;t, and calls for his account afterwards; becau&s;e he would thereby let out of his hands the principal, and indeed only effectual, means of compelling a full and fair one. But, in national bu&s;ine&s;s, there is an additional rea&s;on for a previous production of every account. It is a check, per|haps the only one, upon a corrupt and prodigal u&s;e of public money. An account after payment is to no rational purpo&s;e an account. However, the hou&s;e of commons thought all the&s;e to be antiquat|ed principles; they were of opinion, that the mo&s;t parliamentary way of proceeding was, to pay fir&s;t what the court thought proper to demand, and to take its chance for an examination into accounts at &s;ome time of greater lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE nation had &s;ettled 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year on the crown, as &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of its dignity, upon the e&s;timate of its own mini&s;ters. When mi|ni&s;ters came to parliament, and &s;aid that this allow|ance had not been &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, and that they had incurred a debt of 500,000 <HI>l.</HI> would it not have been natural for parliament fir&s;t to have a&s;k|ed, how, and by what means, their appropriated allowance came to be in&s;ufficient? Would it not have favoured of &s;ome attention to ju&s;tice, to have &s;een in what periods of admini&s;tration this debt had been originally incurred; that they might di&s;cover, and, if need were, animadvert on the per&s;ons who were found the mo&s;t culpable? To put their hands upon &s;uch articles of expenditure as they thought improper or exce&s;&s;ive, and to &s;ecure, in future,
<PB N="236" REF="237">
again&s;t &s;uch mi&s;application or exceeding? Ac|counts for any other purpo&s;es are but a matter of curio&s;ity, and no genuine parliamentary object. All the accounts which could an&s;wer any parlia|mentary end were refu&s;ed, or po&s;tponed by previ|ous que&s;tions. Every idea of prevention was re|jected, as conveying an improper &s;u&s;picion of the mini&s;ters of the crown.</P>
<P>WHEN every leading account had been refu&s;ed, many others were granted with &s;ufficient facility.</P>
<P>BUT with great candour al&s;o, the hou&s;e was in|formed, that hardly any of them could be ready until the next &s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;ome of them perhaps not &s;o &s;oon. But, in order firmly to e&s;tabli&s;h the prece|dent of <HI>payment previous to account,</HI> and to form it into a &s;ettled rule of the hou&s;e, the god in the ma|chine was brought down, nothing le&s;s than the wonder-working <HI>Law of Parliament.</HI> It was al|leged, that it is the law of parliament, when any demand comes from the crown, that the hou&s;e mu&s;t go immediately into the committee of &s;upply; in which committee it was allowed, that the producti|on and examination of accounts would be quite proper and regular. It was therefore carried, that they &s;hould go into the committee without delay, and without accounts, in order to examine with great order and regularity things that could not po&s;&s;ibly come before them. After this &s;troke of orderly and parliamentary wit and humour, they went into the committee; and very generou&s;ly voted the payment.</P>
<P>THERE was a circum&s;tance in that debate too remarkable to be overlooked. This debt of the ci|vil li&s;t was all along argued upon the &s;ame footing as a debt of the &s;tate, contracted upon national au|thority. Its payment was urged as equally pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="237" REF="238">
upon the public faith and honour: and when the whole year's account was &s;tated, in what is called <HI>the Budget,</HI> the mini&s;try valued them&s;elves on the payment of &s;o much public debt, ju&s;t as if they had di&s;charged 500,000 <HI>l.</HI> of navy or exchequer bills. Though, in truth, their payment, from the &s;inking fund, of debt which was never contracted by parli|amentary authority, was, to all intents and pur|po&s;es, &s;o much debt incurred. But &s;uch is the pre|&s;ent notion of public credit, and payment of debt. No wonder that it produces &s;uch effects.</P>
<P>NOR was the hou&s;e at all more attentive to a provident &s;ecurity again&s;t future, than it had been to a vindictive retro&s;pect to pa&s;t, mi&s;managements. I &s;hould have thought indeed that a mini&s;terial pro|mi&s;e during their own continuance in office, might have been given, though this would have been but a poor &s;ecurity for the public. Mr. Pelham gave &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance, and he kept his word. But no|thing was capable of extorting from our mini&s;ters any thing which had the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to a pro|mi&s;e of confining the expences of the civil li&s;t with|in the limits which had been &s;ettled by parliament. This re&s;erve of theirs I look upon to be equivalent to the cleare&s;t declaration, that they were re&s;olved upon a contrary cour&s;e.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to put the matter beyond all doubt, in the &s;peech from the throne, after thanking par|liament for the relief &s;o liberally granted, the mini|&s;ters inform the two hou&s;es, that they will <HI>endeavour</HI> to confine the expences of the civil government&mdash;within what limits, think you? tho&s;e which the law had pre&s;cribed? Not in the lea&s;t&mdash;<Q REND="inline">"&s;uch limits as the "<HI>honour of the crown</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly admit."</Q></P>
<P>THUS they e&s;tabli&s;hed an <HI>arbitrary</HI> &s;tandard for that dignity which parliament had defined and li|mited
<PB N="238" REF="239">
to a <HI>legal</HI> &s;tandard. They gave them&s;elves, under the lax and indeterminate idea of the <HI>honour of the crown,</HI> a full loo&s;e for all manner of di&s;&s;ipati|on, and all manner of corruption. This arbitrary &s;tandard they were not afraid to hold out to both hou&s;es; while an idle and unoperative act of parlia|ment, e&s;timating the dignity of the crown at 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> and confining it to that &s;um, adds to the number of ob&s;olete &s;tatutes which load the &s;helves of libraries without any &s;ort of advantage to the people.</P>
<P>AFTER this proceeding, I &s;uppo&s;e that no man can be &s;o weak as to think that the crown is limited to any &s;ettled allowance what&s;oever. For if the mini&s;try has 800,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year by the law of the land; and if by the law of parliament all the debts which exceed it are to be paid previous to the pro|duction of any account; I pre&s;ume that this is equi|valent to an income with no other limits than the abilities of the &s;ubject and the moderation of the court; that is to &s;ay, it is &s;uch an income as is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by every ab&s;olute monarch in Europe. It amounts, as a per&s;on of great ability &s;aid in the de|bate, to an unlimited power of drawing upon the &s;inking fund. Its effect on the public credit of this kingdom mu&s;t be obvious; for in vain is the &s;inking fund the great buttre&s;s of all the re&s;t, if it be in the power of the mini&s;try to re&s;ort to it for the payment of any debts which they may choo&s;e to incur, under the name of the civil li&s;t, and through the medium of a committee, which thinks it&s;elf obliged by law to vote &s;upplies without any other account than that of the mere exi&s;tence of the debt.</P>
<P>FIVE hundred thou&s;and pounds is a &s;erious &s;um. But it is nothing to the prolific principle upon which the &s;um was voted; a principle that may be well called, <HI>the fruitful mother of an hundred more.</HI>
<PB N="239" REF="240">
Neither is the damage to public credit of very great con&s;equence, when compared with that which re|&s;ults to public morals and to the &s;afety of the con|&s;titution, from the exhau&s;tle&s;s mine of corruption opened by the precedent, and to be wrought by the principle, of the late payment of the debts of the civil li&s;t. The power of di&s;cretionary di&s;quali|fication by one law of parliament, and the nece&s;&s;ity of paying every debt of the civil li&s;t by another law of parliament, if &s;uffered to pa&s;s unnoticed, mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a fund of rewards and terrors as will make parliament the be&s;t appendage and &s;up|port of arbitrary power that ever was invented by the wit of man. This is felt. The quarrel is be|gun between the repre&s;entatives and the people. The court faction have at length committed them.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a &s;trait the wi&s;e&s;t may well be perplexed, and the bolde&s;t &s;taggered. The circum&s;tances are in a great mea&s;ure new. We have hardly any land-marks from the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors, to guide us. At be&s;t we can only follow the &s;pirit of their proceeding in other ca&s;es. I know the dili|gence with which my ob&s;ervations on our public di&s;orders have been made; I am very &s;ure of the integrity of the motives on which they are publi&s;h|ed: I cannot be equally confident in any plan for the ab&s;olute cure of tho&s;e di&s;orders, or for their cer|tain future prevention. My aim is to bring this matter into more public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Let the &s;aga|city of others work upon it. It is not uncommon for medical writers to de&s;cribe hi&s;tories of di&s;ea&s;es very accurately, on who&s;e cure they can &s;ay but very little.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t ideas which generally &s;ugge&s;t them|&s;elves, for the cure of parliamentary di&s;orders, are, to &s;horten the duration of parliaments; and to di&s;|qualify all, or a great number of placemen, from a
<PB N="240" REF="241">
&s;eat in the hou&s;e of commons. Whatever, effica|cy there may be in tho&s;e remedies, I am &s;ure in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things it is impo&s;&s;ible to apply them. A re&s;toration of the right of free election is a preli|minary indi&s;pen&s;able to every other reformation. What alterations ought afterwards to be made in con&s;titution, is a matter of deep and difficult re|&s;earch.</P>
<P>IF I wrote merely to plea&s;e the popular palate, it would indeed be as little trouble&s;ome to me as to another, to extol the&s;e remedies, &s;o famous in &s;peculation, but to which their greate&s;t admirers have never attempted &s;eriou&s;ly to re&s;ort in practice. I confe&s;s then, that I have no &s;ort of reliance upon either a triennial parliament, or a place-bill. With regard to the former, perhaps it might rather &s;erve to counteract, than to promote the ends that are propo&s;ed by it. To &s;ay nothing of the horrible di&s;|orders among the people attending frequent elec|tions, I &s;hould be fearful of committing, every three years, the independent gentlemen of the country into a conte&s;t with the trea&s;ury. It is ea&s;y to &s;ee which of the contending parties would be ruined fir&s;t. Whoever has taken a careful view of public proceedings, &s;o as to endeavour to ground his &s;pe|culations on his experience, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved how prodigiou&s;ly greater the power of mini&s;try is in the fir&s;t and la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of a parliament, than it is in the intermediate period, when members &s;it a little firm on their &s;eats. The per&s;ons of the greate&s;t parliamentary experience, with whom I have con|ver&s;ed, did con&s;tantly, in canva&s;&s;ing the fate of que&s;tions, allow &s;omething to the court-&s;ide, upon account of the elections depending or imminent. The evil complained of, if it exi&s;ts in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, would hardly be removed by a tri|ennial parliament: for, unle&s;s the influence of go|vernment
<PB N="241" REF="242">
in elections can be entirely taken away, the more frequently they return, the more they will hara&s;s private independence; the more generally men will be compelled to fly to the &s;ettled, &s;y&s;te|matic intere&s;t of government, and to the re&s;ources of a boundle&s;s civil li&s;t. Certainly &s;omething may be done, and ought to be done, towards le&s;&s;ening that influence in elections; and this will be nece&s;|&s;ary upon a plan either of longer or &s;horter duration of parliament. But nothing can &s;o perfectly re|move the evil, as not to render &s;uch contentions, too frequently repeated, utterly ruinous, fir&s;t to in|dependence of fortune, and then to independence of &s;pirit. As I am only giving an opinion on this point, and not at all debating it in an adver&s;e line, I hope I may be excu&s;ed in another ob&s;ervation. With great truth I may aver, that I never remem|ber to have talked on this &s;ubject with any man much conver&s;ant with public bu&s;ine&s;s, who con&s;i|dered &s;hort parliaments as a real improvement of the con&s;titution. Gentlemen, warm in a popular cau&s;e, are ready enough to attribute all the decla|rations of &s;uch per&s;ons to corrupt motives. But the habit of affairs, if, on one hand, it tends to corrupt the mind, furni&s;hes it, on the other, with the means of better information. The authority of &s;uch per|&s;ons will always have &s;ome weight. It may &s;tand upon a par with the &s;peculations of tho&s;e who are le&s;s practi&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s; and who, with perhaps purer intentions, have not &s;o effectual means of judging. It is, be&s;ides, an effect of vulgar and puerile malignity to imagine, that every &s;tate&s;man is of cour&s;e corrupt; and that his opinion, upon every con&s;titutional point, is &s;olely formed upon &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THE next favourite remedy is a place-bill. The &s;ame principle guides in both; I mean, the opinion
<PB N="242" REF="243">
which is entertained by many, of the infallibility of laws and regulations, in the cure of public di&s;tem|pers. Without being as unrea&s;onably doubtful as many are unwi&s;ely confident, I will only &s;ay, that this al&s;o is a matter very well worthy of &s;erious and mature reflection. It is not ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, what the effect would be, of di&s;connecting with parlia|ment, the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who hold civil em|ployments, and of &s;uch mighty and important bo|dies as the military and naval e&s;tabli&s;hments. It were better, perhaps, that they &s;hould have a cor|rupt intere&s;t in the forms of the con&s;titution, than that they &s;hould have none at all. This is a que&s;|tion altogether different from the di&s;qualification of a particular de&s;cription of revenue officers from &s;eats in parliament; or, perhaps, of all the lower &s;orts of them from votes in elections. In the former ca&s;e, only the few are affected; in the latter, only the incon&s;iderable. But a great official, a great profe&s;|&s;ional, a great military and naval intere&s;t, all ne|ce&s;&s;arily comprehending many people of the fir&s;t weight, ability, wealth, and &s;pirit, has been gra|dually formed in the kingdom. The&s;e new inte|re&s;ts mu&s;t be let into a &s;hare of repre&s;entation, el&s;e po&s;&s;ibly they may be inclined to de&s;troy tho&s;e in&s;ti|tutions of which they are not permitted to partake. This is not a thing to be trifled with; nor is it every well-meaning man, that is fit to put his hands to it. Many other &s;erious con&s;iderations oc|cur. I do not open them here, becau&s;e they are not directly to my purpo&s;e; propo&s;ing only to give the reader &s;ome ta&s;te of the difficulties that at|tend all capital changes in the con&s;titution; ju&s;t to hint the uncertainty, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, of being able to prevent the court, as long as it has the means of influence abundantly in its power, of applying that influence to parliament; and perhaps, if the public method were precluded, of doing it in &s;ome wor&s;e
<PB N="243" REF="244">
and more dangerous method. Underhand and ob|lique ways would be &s;tudied. The &s;cience of eva|&s;ion, already tolerably under&s;tood, would then be brought to the greate&s;t perfection. It is no incon|&s;iderable part of wi&s;dom, to know how much of an evil ought to be tolerated; le&s;t, by attempting a degree of purity impracticable in degenerate times and manners, in&s;tead of cutting of the &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting ill practices, new corruptions might be pro|duced for the concealment and &s;ecurity of the old. It were better, undoubtedly, that no influence at all could affect the mind of a member of parlia|ment. But of all modes of influence, in my opinion, a place under the government is the lea&s;t di&s;grace|ful to the man who holds it, and by far the mo&s;t &s;afe to the country. I would not &s;hut out that &s;ort of influence which is open and vi&s;ible, which is connected with the dignity and the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, when it is not in my power to prevent the influence of contracts, of &s;ub&s;criptions, of direct bribery, and tho&s;e innumerable methods of clan|de&s;tine corruption, which are abundantly in the hands of the court, and which will be applied as long as the&s;e means of corruption, and the di&s;po|&s;ition to be corrupted, have exi&s;tence among&s;t us. Our con&s;titution &s;tands on a nice equipoi&s;e, with &s;teep precipices and deep waters upon all &s;ides of it. In removing it from a dangerous leaning to|wards one &s;ide, there may be a ri&s;que of over&s;et|ting it on the other. Every project of a material change in a government &s;o complicated as ours, combined at the &s;ame time with external circum|&s;tances &s;till more complicated, is a matter full of difficulties; in which a con&s;iderate man will not be too ready to decide; a prudent man too ready to undertake; or an hone&s;t man too ready to promi&s;e. They do not re&s;pect the public nor them&s;elves, who engage for more, than they are &s;ure that they
<PB N="244" REF="245">
ought to attempt, or that they are able to perform. The&s;e are my &s;entiments, weak perhaps, but hone&s;t and unbia&s;&s;ed; and &s;ubmitted entirely to the opinion of grave men, well affected to the con&s;titution of their country, and of experience in what may be&s;t promote or hurt it.</P>
<P>INDEED, in the &s;ituation in which we &s;tand, with an immen&s;e revenue, an enormous debt, mighty e&s;tabli&s;hments, government it&s;elf a great banker and a great merchant, I &s;ee no other way for the pre&s;ervation of a decent attention to public intere&s;t in the repre&s;entatives, but <HI>the interpo&s;ition of the body of the people it&s;elf,</HI> whenever it &s;hall appear, by &s;ome flagrant and notorious act, by &s;ome ca|pital innovation, that the&s;e repre&s;entatives are going to over-leap the fences of the law, and to intro|duce an arbitrary power. This interpo&s;ition is a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant remedy. But, if it be a legal remedy, it is intended on &s;ome occa&s;ion to be u&s;ed; to be u&s;ed then only, when it is evident that nothing el&s;e can hold the con&s;titution to its true principles.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tempers of monarchy were the great &s;ubjects of apprehen&s;ion and redre&s;s, in the la&s;t century; in this, the di&s;tempers of parliament. It is not in parliament alone that the remedy for parliamentary di&s;orders can be compleated; hardly indeed can it begin there. Until a confidence in government is re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, the people ought to be excited to a more &s;trict and detailed attention to the conduct of their repre&s;entatives. Standards, for judging more &s;y&s;tematically upon their conduct, ought to be &s;ettled in the meetings of counties and corporations. Frequent and correct li&s;ts of the voters in all important que&s;tions ought to be pro|cured.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="246">BY &s;uch means &s;omething may be done. By &s;uch means it may appear who tho&s;e are, that, by an indi&s;criminate &s;upport of all admini&s;trations, have totally bani&s;hed all integrity and confidence out of public proceedings; have confounded the be&s;t men with the wor&s;t; and weakened and di&s;|&s;olved, in&s;tead of &s;trengthening and compacting, the general frame of government. If any per&s;on is more concerned for government and order, than for the liberties of his country; even he is equally concerned to put an end to this cour&s;e of indi&s;cri|minate &s;upport. It is this blind and undi&s;tingui&s;h|ing &s;upport, that feeds the &s;pring of tho&s;e very di&s;orders, by which he is frighted into the arms of the faction which contains in it&s;elf the &s;ource of all di&s;orders, by enfeebling all the vi&s;ible and re|gular authority of the &s;tate. The di&s;temper is in|crea&s;ed by his injudicious and prepo&s;terous endea|vours, or pretences, for the cure of it.</P>
<P>AN exterior admini&s;tration, cho&s;en for its impo|tency, or after it is cho&s;en purpo&s;ely rendered im|potent, in order to be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient, will not be obeyed. The laws them&s;elves will not be re&s;pected, when tho&s;e who execute them are de|&s;pi&s;ed; and they will be de&s;pi&s;ed, when their power is not immediate from the crown, or natural in the kingdom. Never were mini&s;ters better &s;up|ported in parliament. Parliamentary &s;upport comes and goes with office, totally regardle&s;s of the man, or the merit. Is government &s;trengthened? It grows weaker and weaker. The popular torrent gains upon it every hour. Let us learn from our experience. It is not &s;upport that is wanting to government, but reformation. When mini&s;try re&s;ts upon public opinion, it is not indeed built upon a rock of adamant; it has, however, &s;ome &s;tability. But when it &s;tands upon private humour, its &s;truc|ture
<PB N="246" REF="247">
is of &s;tubble, and its foundation is on quick|&s;and. I repeat it again&mdash;He that &s;upports every admini&s;tration, &s;ubverts all government. The rea|&s;on is this. The whole bu&s;ine&s;s in which a court u&s;ually takes an intere&s;t goes on at pre&s;ent equally well, in whatever hands, whether high or low, wi&s;e or fooli&s;h, &s;candalous or reputable; there is nothing therefore to hold it firm to any one body of men, or to any one con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme of politics. Nothing interpo&s;es, to prevent the full operation of all the caprices and all the pa&s;&s;ions of a court upon the &s;ervants of the public. The &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tra|tion is open to continual &s;hocks and changes, upon the principles of the meane&s;t cabal, and the mo&s;t contemptible intrigue. Nothing can be &s;olid and permanent. All good men at length fly with hor|rour from &s;uch a &s;ervice. Men of rank and abi|lity, with the &s;pirit which ought to animate &s;uch men in a free &s;tate, while they decline the juri&s;|diction of a dark cabal on their actions and their fortunes, will, for both, chearfully put them&s;elves upon their country. They will tru&s;t an inqui&s;itive and di&s;tingui&s;hing parliament; becau&s;e it does enquire, and does di&s;tingui&s;h. If they act well, they know, that in &s;uch a parliament, they will be &s;upported again&s;t any intrigue; if they act ill, they know that no intrigue can protect them. This &s;ituation, however aweful, is honourable. But in one hour, and in the &s;elf-&s;ame a&s;&s;embly, without any a&s;&s;igned or a&s;&s;ignable cau&s;e, to be precipitated from the highe&s;t authority to the mo&s;t marked neglect, po&s;&s;ibly into the greate&s;t peril of life and reputation, is a &s;ituation full of danger, and de&s;ti|tute of honour. It will be &s;hunned equally by every man of prudence, and every man of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>SUCH are the con&s;equences of the divi&s;ion of court from the admini&s;tration; and of the divi&s;ion
<PB N="247" REF="248">
of public men among them&s;elves. By the former of the&s;e, lawful government is undone; by the latter, all oppo&s;ition to lawle&s;s power is rendered impotent. Government may in a great mea&s;ure be re&s;tored, if any con&s;iderable bodies of men have hone&s;ty and re&s;olution enough never to accept ad|mini&s;tration, unle&s;s this garri&s;on of <HI>king's men,</HI> which is &s;tationed, as in a citadel, to controul and en&s;lave it, be entirely broken and di&s;banded, and every work they have thrown up be levelled with the ground. The di&s;po&s;ition of public men to keep this corps together, and to act under it, or to co-operate with it, is a touch&s;tone by which every admini&s;tration ought in future to be tried. There has not been one which has not &s;ufficiently expe|rienced the utter incompatibility of that faction with the public peace, and with all the ends of good government: &s;ince, if they oppo&s;ed it, they &s;oon lo&s;t every power of &s;erving the crown; if they &s;ubmitted to it, they lo&s;t all the e&s;teem of their country. Until mini&s;ters give to the public a full proof of their entire alienation from that &s;y&s;|tem, however plau&s;ible their pretences, we may be &s;ure they are more intent on the emoluments than the duties of office. If they refu&s;e to give this proof, we know of what &s;tuff they are made. In this particular, it ought to be the electors bu&s;i|ne&s;s to look to their repre&s;entatives. The electors ought to e&s;teem it no le&s;s culpable in their member to give a &s;ingle vote in parliament to &s;uch an ad|mini&s;tration, than to take an office under it; to endure it, than to act in it. The notorious infide|lity and ver&s;atility of members of parliament, in their opinions of men and things, ought in a par|ticular manner to be con&s;idered by the electors in the enquiry which is recommended to them. This is one of the principal holdings of that de&s;tructive &s;y&s;tem, which has endeavoured to unhinge all the
<PB N="248" REF="249">
virtuous, honourable, and u&s;eful connexions in the kingdom.</P>
<P>THIS cabal has, with great &s;ucce&s;s, propagated a doctrine which &s;erves for a colour to tho&s;e acts of treachery; and whil&s;t it receives any degree of countenance, it will be utterly &s;en&s;ele&s;s to look for a vigorous oppo&s;ition to the court party. The doc|trine is this: That all political connexions are in their nature factious, and as &s;uch ought to be di&s;&s;i|pated and de&s;troyed; and that the rule for form|ing admini&s;trations is mere per&s;onal ability, rated by the judgment of this cabal upon it, and taken by draughts from every divi&s;ion and denomination of public men. This decree was &s;olemnly pro|mulgated by the head of the court corps, the earl of Bute him&s;elf, in a &s;peech which he made, in the year 1766, again&s;t the then admini&s;tration, the only admini&s;tration which he has ever been known directly and publicly to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is indeed in no way wonderful, that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould make &s;uch declarations. That connexion and faction are equivalent terms, is an opinion which has been carefully inculcated at all times by uncon&s;titutional &s;tate&s;men. The rea&s;on is evident. Whil&s;t men are linked together, they ea&s;ily and &s;pedily communicate the alarm of any evil de&s;ign. They are enabled to fathom it with common coun&s;el, and to oppo&s;e it with united &s;trength. Whereas, when they lie di&s;per&s;ed, without concert, order, or di&s;cipline, communica|tion is uncertain, coun&s;el difficult, and re&s;i&s;tance impracticable. Where men are not acquainted with each other's principles, nor experienced in each other's talents, nor at all practi&s;ed in their mutual habitudes and di&s;po&s;itions by joint efforts in bu&s;ine&s;s; no per&s;onal confidence, no friend&s;hip, no common intere&s;t, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among them; it is
<PB N="249" REF="250">
evidently impo&s;&s;ible that they can act a public part with uniformity, per&s;everance, or efficacy. In a connexion, the mo&s;t incon&s;iderable man, by adding to the weight of the whole, has his value, and his u&s;e; out of it, the greate&s;t talents are wholly un|&s;erviceable to the public. No man, who is not in|flamed by vain-glory into enthu&s;ia&s;m, can flatter him&s;elf that his &s;ingle, un&s;upported, de&s;ultory, un&s;y&s;tematic endeavours are of power to defeat the &s;ubtle de&s;igns and united cabals of ambitious citi|zens. When bad men combine, the good mu&s;t a&s;&s;ociate; el&s;e they will fall, one by one, an un|pitied &s;acrifice in a contemptible &s;truggle.</P>
<P>IT is not enough in a &s;ituation of tru&s;t in the commonwealth, that a man means well to his country; it is not enough that in his &s;ingle per&s;on he never did an evil act, but always voted accord|ing to his con&s;cience, and even harangued again&s;t every de&s;ign which he apprehended to be preju|dicial to the intere&s;ts of his country. This innox|ious and ineffectual character, that &s;eems formed upon a plan of apology and di&s;culpation, falls mi&s;erably &s;hort of the mark of public duty. That duty demands and requires, that what is right &s;hould not only be made known, but made pre|valent; that what is evil &s;hould not only be de|tected, but defeated. When the public man omits to put him&s;elf in a &s;ituation of doing his duty with effect, it is an omi&s;&s;ion that fru&s;trates the purpo&s;es of his tru&s;t almo&s;t as much as if he had formally be|trayed it. It is &s;urely no very rational account of a man's life, that he has always acted right; but has taken &s;pecial care, to act in &s;uch a manner that his endeavours could not po&s;&s;ibly be productive of any con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I DO not wonder that the behaviour of many par|ties &s;hould have made per&s;ons of tender and &s;cru|pulous
<PB N="250" REF="251">
virtue &s;omewhat out of humour with all &s;orts of connexion in politics. I admit that people fre|quently acquire in &s;uch confederacies a narrow, bigoted, and pro&s;criptive &s;pirit; that they are apt to &s;ink the idea of the general good in this circum|&s;cribed and partial intere&s;t. But, where duty ren|ders a critical &s;ituation a nece&s;&s;ary one, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s to keep free from the evils attendant upon it; and not to fly from the &s;ituation it&s;elf. If a fortre&s;s is &s;eated in an unwhole&s;ome air, an officer of the garri&s;on is obliged to be attentive to his health, but he mu&s;t not de&s;ert his &s;tation. Every profe&s;&s;ion, not excepting the glorious one of a &s;ol|dier, or the &s;acred one of a prie&s;t, is liable to its own particular vices; which, however, form no argument again&s;t tho&s;e ways of life; nor are the vices them&s;elves inevitable to every individual in tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. Of &s;uch a nature are connexions in politics; e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the full per|formance of our public duty, accidentally liable to degenerate into faction. Commonwealths are made of families, free commonwealths of parties al&s;o; and we may as well affirm, that our natural regards and ties of blood tend inevitably to make men bad citizens, as that the bonds of our party weaken tho&s;e by which we are held to our country.</P>
<P>SOME legi&s;lators went &s;o far as to make neutra|lity in party a crime again&s;t the &s;tate. I do not know whether this might not have been rather to over&s;train the principle. Certain it is, the be&s;t pa|triots in the greate&s;t commonwealths have always commended and promoted &s;uch connexions. <HI>Idem &s;entire de republica,</HI> was with them a principal ground of friend&s;hip and attachment; nor do I know any other capable of forming firmer, dearer, more plea&s;ing, more honourable, and more virtuous ha|bitudes. The Romans carried this principle a great
<PB N="251" REF="252">
way. Even the holding of offices together, the di&s;|po&s;ition of which aro&s;e from chance not &s;election, gave ri&s;e to a relation which continued for life. It was called <HI>nece&s;&s;itudo &s;ortis</HI>; and it was looked upon with a &s;acred reverence. Breaches of any of the&s;e kinds of civil relation were con&s;idered as acts of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed turpitude. The whole people was di&s;tributed into political &s;ocieties, in which they acted in &s;upport of &s;uch intere&s;ts in the &s;tate as they &s;everally affected. For it was then thought no crime, to endeavour by every hone&s;t means to ad|vance to &s;uperiority and power tho&s;e of your own &s;entiments and opinions. This wi&s;e people was far from imagining that tho&s;e connexions had no tie, and obliged to no duty; but that men might quit them without &s;hame, upon every call of intere&s;t. They believed private honour to be the great foun|dation of public tru&s;t; that friend&s;hip was no mean &s;tep towards patrioti&s;m; that he who, in the com|mon intercour&s;e of life, &s;hewed he regarded &s;ome|body be&s;ides him&s;elf, when he came to act in a public &s;ituation, might probably con&s;ult &s;ome other intere&s;t than his own. Never may we become <HI>plus &s;ages que les &s;ages,</HI> as the French comedian has hap|pily expre&s;&s;ed it, wi&s;er than all the wi&s;e and good men who have lived before us. It was their wi&s;h, to &s;ee public and private virtues, not di&s;&s;onant and jarring, and mutually de&s;tructive, but harmoniou&s;ly combined, growing out of one another in a noble and orderly gradation, reciprocally &s;upporting and &s;upported. In one of the mo&s;t fortunate periods of our hi&s;tory this country was governed by a <HI>con|nexion</HI>; I mean the great connexion of whigs in the reign of queen Anne. They were complimented upon the principle of this connexion by a poet who was in high e&s;teem with them. Addi&s;on, who knew their &s;entiments, could not prai&s;e them for what they con&s;idered as no proper &s;ubject of com|mendation.
<PB N="252" REF="253">
As a poet who knew his bu&s;ine&s;s, he could not applaud them for a thing which in ge|neral e&s;timation was not highly reputable. Ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Britain,
<Q><L>Thy fav'rites grow not up by fortunes &s;port,</L>
<L>Or from the crimes or follies of a court.</L>
<L>On the firm ba&s;is of de&s;ert they ri&s;e,</L>
<L>From long-try'd faith, and friend&s;hip's holy ties.</L></Q></P>
<P>THE whigs of tho&s;e days believed that the only proper method of ri&s;ing into power was through hard e&s;&s;ays of practi&s;ed friend&s;hip and experimented fidelity. At that time it was not imagined, that patrioti&s;m was a bloody idol, which required the &s;acrifice of children and parents, or deare&s;t con|nexions in private life, and of all the virtues that ri&s;e from tho&s;e relations. They were not of that ingenious paradoxical morality, to imagine that a &s;pirit of moderation was properly &s;hewn in patiently bearing the &s;ufferings of your friends; or that di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s was clearly manife&s;ted at the expence of other peoples fortune. They believed that no men could act with effect, who did not act in con|cert; that no men could act in concert, who did not act with confidence; and that no men could act with confidence, who were not bound together by common opinions, common affections, and com|mon intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>THESE wi&s;e men, for &s;uch I mu&s;t call lord Sun|derland, lord Godolphin, lord Sommers, and lord Marlborough, were too well principled in the&s;e maxims upon which the whole fabric of public &s;trength is built, to be blown off their ground by the breath of every childi&s;h talker. They were not afraid that they &s;hould be called an ambitious Junto; or that their re&s;olution to &s;tand or fall toge|ther
<PB N="253" REF="254">
&s;hould, by placemen, be interpreted into a &s;cuffle for places.</P>
<P>PARTY is a body of men united, for promoting by their joint endeavours the national intere&s;t, upon &s;ome particular principle in which they are all agreed. For my part, I find it impo&s;&s;ible to con|ceive, that any one believes in his own politics, or thinks them to be of any weight, who refu&s;es to adopt the means of having them reduced into prac|tice. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;peculative philo|&s;opher to mark the proper ends of government. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the politician, who is the phi|lo&s;opher in action, to find out proper means towards tho&s;e ends, and to employ them with effect. There|fore every honourable connexion will avow it is their fir&s;t purpo&s;e, to pur&s;ue every ju&s;t method to put the men who hold their opinions into &s;uch a condition as may enable them to carry their com|mon plans into execution, with all the power and authority of the &s;tate. As this power is attached to certain &s;ituations, it is their duty to contend for the&s;e &s;ituations. Without a pro&s;cription of others, they are bound to give to their own party the pre|ference in all things; and by no means, for private con&s;iderations, to accept any offers of power in which the whole body is not included; nor to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be led, or to be controuled, or to be over-balanced, in office or in council, by tho&s;e who contradict the very fundamental principles on which their party is formed, and even tho&s;e upon which every fair connexion mu&s;t &s;tand. Such a generous contention for power, on &s;uch manly and honourable maxims, will ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the mean and intere&s;ted &s;truggle for place and emolument. The very &s;tile of &s;uch per&s;ons will &s;erve to di&s;cri|minate them from tho&s;e numberle&s;s impo&s;tors, who have deluded the ignorant with profe&s;&s;ions incom|patible
<PB N="254" REF="255">
with human practice, and have afterwards incen&s;ed them by practices below the level of vul|gar rectitude.</P>
<P>IT is an advantage to all narrow wi&s;dom and narrow morals, that their maxims have a plau&s;ible air; and, on a cur&s;ory view, appear equal to fir&s;t principles. They are light and portable. They are as current as copper coin; and about as valu|able. They &s;erve equally the fir&s;t capacities and the lowe&s;t; and they are, at lea&s;t, as u&s;eful to the wor&s;t men as the be&s;t. Of this &s;tamp is the cant of <HI>Not men, but mea&s;ures</HI>; a &s;ort of charm, by which many people get loo&s;e from every honour|able engagement. When I &s;ee a man acting this de&s;ultory and di&s;connected part, with as much de|triment to his own fortune as prejudice to the cau&s;e of any party, I am not per&s;uaded that he is right; but I am ready to believe he is in earne&s;t. I re&s;pect virtue in all its &s;ituations; even when it is found in the un&s;uitable company of weakne&s;s. I lament to &s;ee qualities, rare and valuable, &s;quandered away without any public utility. But when a gentle|man with great vi&s;ible emoluments abandons the party in which he has long acted, and tells you, it is becau&s;e he proceeds upon his own judgment; that he acts on the merits of the &s;everal mea&s;ures as they ari&s;e; and that he is obliged to follow his own con&s;cience, and not that of others; he gives rea|&s;ons which it is impo&s;&s;ible to controvert, and di&s;|covers a character which it is impo&s;&s;ible to mi&s;take. What &s;hall we think of him who never differed from a certain &s;et of men until the moment they lo&s;t their power, and who never agreed with them in a &s;ingle in&s;tance afterwards? Would not &s;uch a coincidence of intere&s;t and opinion be rather fortunate? Would it not be an extraordinary ca&s;t upon the dice, that a man's connexions &s;hould degenerate into faction,
<PB N="255" REF="256">
preci&s;ely at the critical moment when they lo&s;e their power, or he accepts a place? When people de&s;ert their connexions, the de&s;ertion is a manife&s;t <HI>fact,</HI> upon which a direct &s;imple i&s;&s;ue lies, triable by plain men. Whether a <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of government be right or wrong, is <HI>no matter of fact,</HI> but a mere affair of opinion, on which men may, as they do, di&s;pute and wrangle without end. But whether the individual <HI>thinks</HI> the mea&s;ure right or wrong, is a point at &s;till a greater di&s;tance from the reach of all human deci&s;ion. It is therefore very conve|nient to politicians, not to put the judgment of their conduct on overt-acts, cognizable in any or|dinary court, but upon &s;uch matter as can be tri|able only in that &s;ecret tribunal, where they are &s;ure of being heard with favour, or where at wor&s;t the &s;entence will be only private whipping.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE the reader would wi&s;h to find no &s;ub&s;tance in a doctrine which has a tendency to de&s;troy all te&s;t of character as deduced from con|duct. He will therefore excu&s;e my adding &s;ome|thing more, towards the further clearing up a point, which the great convenience of ob&s;curity to di&s;hone&s;ty has been able to cover with &s;ome degree of darkne&s;s and doubt.</P>
<P>IN order to throw an odium on political con|nexion, the&s;e politicians &s;uppo&s;e it a nece&s;&s;ary in|cident to it, that you are blindly to follow the opinions of your party, when in direct oppo&s;ition to your own clear ideas; a degree of &s;ervitude that no worthy man could bear the thought of &s;ub|mitting to; and &s;uch as, I believe, no connexions (except &s;ome court factions) ever could be &s;o &s;en&s;e|le&s;sly tyrannical as to impo&s;e. Men thinking freely, will, in particular in&s;tances, think differently. But &s;till, as the greater part of the mea&s;ures which ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of public bu&s;ine&s;s are related to,
<PB N="256" REF="257">
or dependent on, &s;ome great <HI>leading general princi|ples in government,</HI> a man mu&s;t be peculiarly un|fortunate in the choice of his political company if he does not agree with them at lea&s;t nine times in ten. If he does not concur in the&s;e general prin|ciples upon which the party is founded, and which nece&s;&s;arily draw on a concurrence in their applica|tion, he ought from the beginning to have cho&s;en &s;ome other, more conformable to his opinions. When the que&s;tion is in its nature doubtful, or not very material, the mode&s;ty which becomes an indi|vidual, and (in &s;pite of our court morali&s;ts) that partiality which becomes a well-cho&s;en friend&s;hip, will frequently bring on an acquie&s;cence in the ge|neral &s;entiment. Thus the di&s;agreement will na|turally be rare; it will be only enough to indulge freedom, without violating concord, or di&s;turbing arrangement. And this is all that ever was requir|ed for a character of the greate&s;t uniformity and &s;teadine&s;s in connexion. How men can proceed without any connexion at all, is to me utterly in|comprehen&s;ible. Of what &s;ort of materials mu&s;t that man be made, how mu&s;t he be tempered and put together, who can &s;it whole years in parlia|ment, with five hundred and fifty of his fellow citizens, amid&s;t the &s;torm of &s;uch tempe&s;tuous pa&s;&s;ions, in the &s;harp conflict of &s;o many wits, and tempers, and characters, in the agitation of &s;uch mighty que&s;tions, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;uch va&s;t and ponderous intere&s;ts, without &s;eeing any one &s;ort of men, who&s;e character, conduct, or di&s;po&s;ition, would lead him to a&s;&s;ociate him&s;elf with them, to aid and be aided, in any one &s;y&s;tem of public utility?</P>
<P>I REMEMBER an old &s;chola&s;tic aphori&s;m, which &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the man who lives wholly detached from others, mu&s;t be either an angel or a devil."</Q>
<PB N="257" REF="258">
When I &s;ee in any of the&s;e detached gentlemen of our times the angelic purity, power, and benefi|cence, I &s;hall admit them to be angels. In the mean time we are born only to be men. We &s;hall do enough if we form our&s;elves to be good ones. It is therefore our bu&s;ine&s;s carefully to cultivate in our minds, to rear to the mo&s;t perfect vigour and maturity, every &s;ort of generous and hone&s;t feeling that belongs to our nature. To bring the di&s;po&s;i|tions that are lovely in private life into the &s;ervice and conduct of the commonwealth; &s;o to be pa|triots, as not to forget we are gentlemen. To cultivate friend&s;hips, and to incur enmities. To have both &s;trong, but both &s;elected: in the one, to be placable; in the other, immovable. To model our principles to our duties and our &s;ituation. To be fully per&s;uaded, that all virtue which is impracticable is &s;purious; and rather to run the ri&s;que of falling into faults in a cour&s;e which leads us to act with effect and energy, than to loiter out our days without blame, and without u&s;e. Public life is a &s;ituation of power and energy; he tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t his duty who &s;leeps upon his watch, as well as he that goes over to the enemy.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, a time for all things. It is not every conjuncture which calls with equal force upon the activity of hone&s;t men; but critical exigencies now and then ari&s;e; and I am mi&s;taken, if this be not one of them. Men will &s;ee the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of hone&s;t combination; but they may &s;ee it when it is too late. They may embody, when it will be ruinous to them&s;elves, and of no advantage to the country; when, for want of &s;uch a timely union as may enable them to oppo&s;e in favour of the laws, with the laws on their &s;ide, they may, at length, find them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of con|&s;piring,
<PB N="258" REF="259">
in&s;tead of con&s;ulting. The law, for which they &s;tand, may become a weapon in the hands of its bittere&s;t enemies; and they will be ca&s;t, at length, into that mi&s;erable alternative, between &s;lavery and civil confu&s;ion, which no good man can look upon without horrour; an alternative in which it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould take either part, with a con&s;cience perfectly at repo&s;e. To keep that &s;ituation of guilt and remor&s;e at the utmo&s;t di&s;tance, is, therefore, our fir&s;t obligation. Early activity may prevent late and fruitle&s;s violence. As yet we work in the light. The &s;cheme of the enemies of public tranquillity has di&s;arranged, it has not de&s;troyed us.</P>
<P>IF the reader believes that there really exi&s;ts &s;uch a faction as I have de&s;cribed; a faction ruling by the private inclinations of a court, again&s;t the general &s;en&s;e of the people; and that this faction, whil&s;t it pur&s;ues a &s;cheme for undermining all the foundations of our freedom, weakens (for the pre|&s;ent at lea&s;t) all the powers of executory govern|ment, rendering us abroad contemptible, and at home di&s;tracted; he will believe al&s;o, that nothing but a firm combination of public men again&s;t this body, and that, too, &s;upported by the hearty con|currence of the people at large, can po&s;&s;ibly get the better of it. The people will &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;toring public men to an attention to the pub|lic opinion, and of re&s;toring the con&s;titution to its original principles. Above all, they will endea|vour to keep the hou&s;e of commons from a&s;&s;uming a character which does not belong to it. They will endeavour to keep that hou&s;e, for its exi&s;tence, for its powers, and its privileges, as independent of every other, and as dependent upon them&s;elves, as po&s;&s;ible. This &s;ervitude is to an hou&s;e of commons
<PB N="259" REF="260">
(like obedience to the Divine law)
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"perfect free|dom."</Q>
For if they once quit this natural, ra|tional, and liberal obedience, having de&s;erted the only proper foundation of their power, they mu&s;t &s;eek a &s;upport in an abject and unnatural de|pendence &s;omewhere el&s;e. When, through the medium of this ju&s;t connexion with their con|&s;tituents, the genuine dignity of the hou&s;e of commons is re&s;tored, it will begin to think of ca&s;ting from it, with &s;corn, as badges of &s;ervi|lity, all the fal&s;e ornaments of illegal power, with which it has been, for &s;ometime, di&s;graced. It will begin to think of its old office of CON|TROUL. It will not &s;uffer, that la&s;t of evils, to predominate in the country; men without popu|lar confidence, public opinion, natural connexi|on, or mutual tru&s;t, inve&s;ted with all the powers of government.</P>
<P>WHEN they have learned this le&s;&s;on them&s;elves, they will be willing and able to teach the court, that it is the true intere&s;t of the prince to have but one admini&s;tration; and that one compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who recommend them&s;elves to their &s;overeign through the opinion of their country, and not by their ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s to a favourite. Such men will &s;erve their &s;overeign with affection and fidelity; becau&s;e his choice of them, upon &s;uch principles, is a compliment to their virtue. They will be able to &s;erve him effectually; becau&s;e they will add the weight of the country to the force of the executory power. They will be able to &s;erve their king with dignity; becau&s;e they will never abu&s;e his name to the gratification of their private &s;pleen or avarice. This, with allowances for human frailty, may pro|bably be the general character of a mini&s;try, which
<PB N="260" REF="261">
thinks it&s;elf accountable to the hou&s;e of commons; when the hou&s;e of commons thinks it&s;elf accounta|ble to its con&s;tituents.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following &s;peech has been much the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; and the de&s;ire of having it printed was la&s;t &s;ummer very general. The means of gratifying the pub|lic curio&s;ity were obligingly furni&s;hed from the notes of &s;ome gentlemen, members of the la&s;t parliament.</P>
<P>THIS piece has been for &s;ome months ready for the pre&s;s. But a delicacy, po&s;&s;ibly over-&s;crupulous, has delayed the publication to this time. The friends of admini&s;tration have been u&s;e to attribute a great deal of the oppo&s;ition to their mea&s;ures in America to the writings publi&s;hed in England. The Editor of this &s;peech kept it back, until all the mea&s;ures of government have had their full operation, and can be no longer affected, if ever they could have been affected, by any publication.</P>
<P>MOST readers will recollect the uncom|mon pains taken at the beginning of the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t parliament, and indeed during the whole cour&s;e of it, to a&s;per&s;e the characters, and decry the mea&s;ures, of tho&s;e who were &s;uppo&s;ed to be friends to Ame|rica;
<PB N="264" REF="264">
in order to weaken the effect of their oppo&s;ition to the acts of rigour then prepar|ing again&s;t the colonies. This &s;peech con|tains a full refutation of the charges again&s;t that party with which Mr. Burke has all along acted. In doing this, he has taken a review of the effects of all the &s;chemes which have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively adopted in the government of the plantations. The &s;ubject is intere&s;ting; the matters of information various, and important; and the publica|tion at this time, the editor hopes, will not be thought un&s;ea&s;onable.</P>

<HEADNOTE>
<P>DURING the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of the la&s;t parlia|ment, on the 19th of April, 1774, Mr. Ro&s;e Fuller, member for Rye, made the following mo|tion; that an act made in the &s;eventh year of the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, intituled,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An act for granting certain duties in the Briti&s;h colonies and plantations in America; for allowing a drawback of the duties of cu&s;toms upon the ex|portation from this kingdom of Coffee and Cocoa Nuts, of the produce of the &s;aid colonies or plantations; for di&s;continuing the drawbacks payable on China Earthen Ware exported to America; and for more effectually preventing the clande&s;tine running of goods in the &s;aid co|lonies and plantations;"</Q> might be read.</P>
<P>AND the &s;ame being read accordingly; he moved,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That this hou&s;e will, upon this day &s;evennight, re&s;olve it&s;elf into a committee of the whole hou&s;e, to take into con&s;ideration the duty of 3<HI>d. per</HI> pound weight upon tea, payable in all his Maje&s;ty's dominions in America, impo&s;ed by the &s;aid act; and al&s;o the appropriation of the &s;aid duty."</Q></P>
<P>ON this latter motion a warm and intere&s;ting debate aro&s;e, in which Mr. Edmund Burke &s;poke as follows:</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<PB N="266" REF="266">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AGREE with the honourable gentleman<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Charles Wolfran Cornwall, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> lately appointed one of the Lords of the Trea&s;ury.</NOTE> who &s;poke la&s;t, that this &s;ubject is not new in this hou&s;e. Very di&s;agreeably to this hou&s;e, very un|fortunately to this nation, and to the peace and pro&s;perity of this whole empire, no topic has been more familiar to us. For nine long years, &s;e&s;&s;ion after &s;e&s;&s;ion, we have been la&s;hed round and round this mi&s;erable circle of occa&s;ional arguments and temporary expedients. I am &s;ure our heads mu&s;t turn, and our &s;tomachs nau&s;eate with them. We have had them in every &s;hape; we have looked at them in every point of view. Invention is ex|hau&s;ted; rea&s;on is fatigued; experience has given judgment; but ob&s;tinacy is not yet conquered.</P>
<P>THE hon. gentleman has made one endeavour more to diver&s;ity the form of this di&s;gu&s;ting argu|ment. He has thrown out a &s;peech compo&s;ed al|mo&s;t entirely of challenges. Challenges are &s;erious things; and as he is a man of prudence as well as re&s;olution, I dare &s;ay he has very well weighed tho&s;e challenges before he delivered them. I had long the happine&s;s to &s;it at the &s;ame &s;ide of the hou&s;e, and to agree with the hon. gentleman on all the American que&s;tions. My &s;entiments, I am &s;ure, are well known to him; and I thought I had been perfectly acquainted with his. Though I find my|&s;elf mi&s;taken, he will &s;till permit me to u&s;e the privi|lege of an old friend&s;hip; he will permit me to apply my&s;elf to the hou&s;e under the &s;anction of his autho|rity; and, on the various grounds he has mea&s;ured out, to &s;ubmit to you the poor opinions which I have formed, upon a matter of importance enough to demand the fulle&s;t con&s;ideration I could be&s;tow upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="267">He has &s;tated to the hou&s;e two grounds of delibe|ration; one narrow and &s;imple, and merely confin|ed to the que&s;tion on your paper: the other more large and more complicated; comprehending the whole &s;eries of the parliamentary proceedings with regard to America, their cau&s;es, and their con&s;e|quences. With regard to the latter ground, he &s;tates it as u&s;ele&s;s, and thinks it may be even dan|gerous, to enter into &s;o exten&s;ive a field of enqui|ry. Yet, to my &s;urprize, he had hardly laid down this re&s;trictive propo&s;ition, to which his authority would have given &s;o much weight, when directly, and with the &s;ame authority, he condemns it; and declares it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enter into the mo&s;t ample hi&s;torical detail. His zeal has thrown him a little out of his u&s;ual accuracy. In this per|plexity what &s;hall we do, &s;ir, who are willing to &s;ubmit to the law he gives us? He has reprobated in one part of his &s;peech the rule he had laid down for debate in the other; and, after narrowing the ground for all tho&s;e who are to &s;peak after him, he takes an excur&s;ion him&s;elf, as unbounded as the &s;ubject and the extent of his great abilities.</P>
<P>SIR, when I cannot obey all his laws, I will do the be&s;t I can. I will endeavour to obey &s;uch of them as have the &s;anction of his example; and to &s;tick to that rule, which, though not con&s;i&s;tent with the other, is the mo&s;t rational. He was certainly in the right when he took the matter largely. I cannot prevail on my&s;elf to agree with him in his cen&s;ure of his own conduct. It is not, he will give me leave to &s;ay, either u&s;ele&s;s or dangerous. He a&s;&s;erts, that retro&s;pect is not wi&s;e: and the proper, the only proper, &s;ubject of enquiry is,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"not how we got into this difficulty, but how we are to get out of it."</Q>
In other words, we are, according to him, to con&s;ult our invention, and to reject our
<PB N="268" REF="268">
experience. The mode of deliberation he recom|mends is diametrically oppo&s;ite to every rule of rea&s;on, and every principle of good &s;en&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h|ed among&s;t mankind. For, that &s;en&s;e and that rea&s;on, I have always under&s;tood, ab&s;olutely to pre&s;cribe, whenever we are involved in difficulties from the mea&s;ures we have pur&s;ued, that we &s;hould take a &s;trict review of tho&s;e mea&s;ures, in order to correct our errors if they &s;hould be corrigible; or at lea&s;t to avoid a dull uniformity in mi&s;chief, and the unpitied calamity of being repeatedly caught in the &s;ame &s;nare.</P>
<P>SIR, I will freely follow the hon. gentleman in his hi&s;torical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, without the lea&s;t manage|ment for men or mea&s;ures, further than as they &s;hall &s;eem to me to de&s;erve it. But before I go into that large con&s;ideration, becau&s;e I would omit nothing that can give the hou&s;e &s;atisfaction, I wi&s;h to tread the narrow ground to which alone the hon. gentleman, in one part of his &s;peech, has &s;o &s;trictly confined us.</P>
<P>HE de&s;ires to know, whether, if we were to re|peal this tax, agreeably to the propo&s;ition of the hon. gentleman who made the motion, the Ameri|cans would not take po&s;t on this conce&s;&s;ion, in order to make a new attack on the next body of taxes; and whether they would not call for a re|peal of the duty on wine as loudly as they do now for the repeal of the duty on tea? Sir, I can give no &s;ecurity on this &s;ubject. But I will do all that I can, and all that can be fairly demanded. To the <HI>experience</HI> which the hon. gentleman reprobates in one in&s;tant, and reverts to in the next; to that ex|perience, without the lea&s;t wavering or he&s;itation on my part, I &s;teadily appeal; and would to God there was no other arbiter to decide on the vote with which the hou&s;e is to conclude this day!</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="269">WHEN parliament repealed the &s;tamp act in the year 1766, I affirm, fir&s;t, that the Americans did <HI>not</HI> in con&s;equence of this mea&s;ure call upon you to give up the former parliamentary revenue which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in that country; or even any one of the articles which compo&s;e it. I affirm al&s;o, that when, departing from the maxims of that repeal, you re|vived the &s;cheme of taxation, and thereby filled the minds of the coloni&s;ts with new jealou&s;y, and all &s;orts of apprehen&s;ions, then it was that they quar|relled with the old taxes, as well as the new; then it was, and not till then, that they que&s;tioned all the parts of your legi&s;lative power; and by the battery of &s;uch que&s;tions have &s;haken the &s;olid &s;tructure of this Empire to its deepe&s;t foundations.</P>
<P>ON tho&s;e two propo&s;itions I &s;hall, before I have done, give &s;uch convincing, &s;uch damning proof, that, however the contrary may be whi&s;pered in circles, or bawled in news-papers, they never more will dare to rai&s;e their voices in this hou&s;e. I &s;peak with great confidence. I have rea&s;on for it. The mini&s;ters are with me. <HI>They</HI> at lea&s;t are convinced that the repeal of the &s;tamp act had not, and that no repeal can have, the con&s;equences which the hon. gentleman who defends their mea&s;ures is &s;o much alarmed at. To their conduct, I refer him for a conclu&s;ive an&s;wer to his objection. I carry my proof irre&s;i&s;tibly into the very body of both mi|ni&s;try and parliament; not on any general rea&s;on|ing growing out of collateral matter, but on the conduct of the hon. gentleman's mini&s;terial friends on the new revenue it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE act of 1767, which grants this tea duty, &s;ets forth in its preamble, that it was expedient to rai&s;e a revenue in America, for the &s;upport of the civil government there, as well as for purpo&s;es &s;till more exten&s;ive. To this &s;upport the act a&s;&s;igns
<PB N="270" REF="270">
&s;ix branches of duties. About two years after this act pa&s;&s;ed, the mini&s;try, I mean the pre&s;ent mi|ni&s;try, thought it expedient to repeal five of the duties, and to leave (for rea&s;ons be&s;t known to them&s;elves) only the &s;ixth &s;tanding. Suppo&s;e any per&s;on, at the time of that repeal, had thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed the mini&s;ter<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Lord North, then chancellor of the Exchequer.</NOTE>:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Condemning, as you do, the repeal of the &s;tamp act, why do you venture to repeal the duties upon gla&s;s, paper, and painters colours? Let your pretence for the repeal be what it will, are not you thoroughly convinced, that your conce&s;&s;ions will produce, not &s;atisfaction, but in&s;olence in the Americans; and that the giving up the&s;e taxes will nece&s;&s;itate the giving up of all the re&s;t?"</Q>
This objection was as palpable then as it is now; and it was as good for pre&s;erving the five duties as for retaining the &s;ixth. Be&s;ides, the mini&s;ter will recollect, that the repeal of the &s;tamp act had but ju&s;t preceded his repeal; and the ill policy of that mea&s;ure (had it been &s;o impolitic as it has been repre&s;ented), and the mi&s;chiefs it produced, were quite recent. Upon the principles therefore of the hon. gentleman, upon the principles of the mini&s;ter him&s;elf, the mini&s;ter has nothing at all to an&s;wer. He &s;tands condemned by him&s;elf, and by all his a&s;&s;ociates old and new, as a de&s;troyer, in the fir&s;t tru&s;t of finance, of the revenues; and in the fir&s;t rank of honour, as a betrayer of the dignity of his country.</P>
<P>MOST men, e&s;pecially great men, do not always know their well-wi&s;hers. I come to re&s;cue that no|ble lord out of the hands of tho&s;e he calls his friends; and even out of his own. I will do him the ju&s;tice, he is denied at home. He has not been this wicked or imprudent man. He knew that a repeal had no tendency to produce the mi&s;chiefs
<PB N="271" REF="271">
which give &s;o much alarm to his honourable friend. His work was not bad in its principle, but imper|fect in its execution; and the motion on your paper pre&s;&s;es him only to compleat a proper plan, which, by &s;ome unfortunate and unaccountable error, he had left unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P>I HOPE, &s;ir, the hon. gentleman who &s;poke la&s;t is thoroughly &s;atisfied, and &s;atisfied out of the pro|ceedings of mini&s;try on their own favourite act, that his fears from a repeal are groundle&s;s. If he is not, I leave him, and the noble lord who &s;its by him, to &s;ettle the matter, as well as they can, together; for if the repeal of American taxes de&s;troys all our go|vernment in America&mdash;He is the man!&mdash;and he is the wor&s;t of all the repealers, becau&s;e he is the la&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT I hear it rung continually in my ears, now and formerly,&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The preamble! what will become of the preamble, if you repeal this tax?"</Q>
&mdash;I am &s;orry to be compelled &s;o often to expo&s;e the cala|mities and di&s;graces of parliament. The preamble of this law, &s;tanding as it now &s;tands, has the lie direct given to it by the provi&s;ionary part of the act; if that can be called provi&s;ionary which makes no provi&s;ion. I &s;hould be afraid to expre&s;s my|&s;elf in this manner, e&s;pecially in the face of &s;uch a formidable array of ability as is now drawn up be|fore me, compo&s;ed of the antient hou&s;ehold troops of that &s;ide of the hou&s;e, and the new recruits from this, if the matter were not clear and indi&s;putable. Nothing but truth could give me this firmne&s;s; but plain truth and clear evidence can be beat down by no ability. The clerk will be &s;o good as to turn to the act, and to read this favourite preamble:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>WHEREAS it is</HI> expedient <HI>that a revenue &s;hould be rai&s;ed in your Maje&s;ty's dominions in America, for</HI>
<PB N="272" REF="272">
<HI>making a more</HI> certain <HI>and</HI> adequate <HI>provi&s;ion for de|fraying the charge of the</HI> admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and &s;upport of civil government, <HI>in &s;uch provinces where it &s;hall be found nece&s;&s;ary; and towards</HI> further defray|ing <HI>the expences of</HI> defending, protecting, and &s;e|curing the &s;aid dominions.</Q></P>
<P>YOU have heard this pompous performance. Now where is the revenue which is to do all the&s;e mighty things? Five-&s;ixths repealed&mdash;abandoned&mdash;&s;unk&mdash;gone&mdash;lo&s;t for ever. Does the poor &s;olitary tea duty &s;upport the purpo&s;es of this preamble? Is not the &s;upply there &s;tated as effectually abandoned as if the tea duty had peri&s;hed in the general wreck? Here, Mr. Speaker, is a precious mockery&mdash;a pre|amble without an act&mdash;taxes granted in order to be repealed&mdash;and the rea&s;ons of the grant &s;till carefully kept up! This is rai&s;ing a revenue in America! This is pre&s;erving dignity in England! If you repeal this tax in compliance with the motion, I readily admit that you lo&s;e this fair preamble. E&s;ti|mate your lo&s;s in it. The object of the act is gone already; and all you &s;uffer is the purging the Sta|tute-book of the opprobrium of an empty, ab&s;urd, and fal&s;e recital.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid again and again, that the five taxes were repealed on commercial principles. It is &s;o &s;aid in the paper in my hand<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lord Hil&s;borough's circular letter to the governors of the colonies concerning the repeal of &s;ome of the duties laid in the act of 1767.</NOTE>; a paper which I con&s;tantly carry about; which I have often u&s;ed, and &s;hall often u&s;e again. What is got by this paltry pretence of commercial principles I know not; for, if your government in America is de|&s;troyed by the <HI>repeal of taxes,</HI> it is of no con&s;equence upon what ideas the repeal is grounded. Repeal this tax too upon commercial principles if you
<PB N="273" REF="273">
plea&s;e. The&s;e principles will &s;erve as well now as they did formerly. But you know that, either your objection to a repeal from the&s;e &s;uppo|&s;ed con&s;equences has no validity, or that this pre|tence never could remove it. This commercial motive never was believed by any man, either in America, which this letter is meant to &s;oothe, or in England, which it is meant to deceive. It was impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould. Becau&s;e every man, in the lea&s;t acquainted with the detail of commerce, mu&s;t know, that &s;everal of the articles on which the tax was repealed were fitter objects of duties than al|mo&s;t any other articles that could po&s;&s;ibly be cho|&s;en; without compari&s;on more &s;o, than the Tea that was left taxed; as infinitely le&s;s liable to be eluded by contraband. The tax upon red and white Lead was of this nature. You have, in this kingdom, an advantage in Lead, that amounts to a monopoly. When you find your&s;elf in this &s;itu|ation of advantage, you &s;ometimes venture to tax even your own export. You did &s;o, &s;oon after the la&s;t war, when, upon this principle, you ventured to impo&s;e a duty on coals. In all the articles of American contraband trade, who ever heard of the &s;muggling of red lead, and white lead? You might, therefore, well enough, without danger of contraband, and without injury to commerce (if this were the whole con&s;ideration) have taxed the&s;e commodities. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of Gla&s;s. Be&s;ides, &s;ome of the things taxed were &s;o trivial, that the lo&s;s of the objects them&s;elves, and their ut|ter annihilation out of American commerce, would have been comparatively as nothing. But is the article of Tea &s;uch an object in the trade of Eng|land, as not to be felt, or felt but &s;lightly, like white Lead, and red Lead, and Painters colours? Tea is an object of far other importance. Tea is perhaps the mo&s;t important object, taking it with
<PB N="274" REF="274">
its nece&s;&s;ary connections, of any in the mighty cir|cle of our commerce. If commercial principles had been the true motives to the repeal, or had they been at all attended to, Tea would have been the la&s;t article we &s;hould have left taxed for a &s;ubject of controver&s;y.</P>
<P>SIR, it is not a plea&s;ant con&s;ideration; but no|thing in the world can read &s;o awful and &s;o in&s;truc|tive a le&s;&s;on, as the conduct of mini&s;try in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, upon the mi&s;chief of not having large and li|beral ideas in the management of great affairs. Never have the &s;ervants of the &s;tate looked at the whole of your complicated intere&s;ts in one connect|ed view. They have taken things, by bits and &s;craps, &s;ome at one time and one pretence, and &s;ome at another, ju&s;t as they pre&s;&s;ed, without any &s;ort of regard to their relations or dependencies They never had any kind of &s;y&s;tem, right or wrong; but only invented occa&s;ionally &s;ome mi&s;e|rable tale for the day, in order meanly to &s;neak out of difficulties, into which they had proudly &s;trutted. And they were put to all the&s;e &s;hifts and devices, full of meanne&s;s and full of mi&s;chief, in order to pil&s;er piecemeal a repeal of an act, which they had not the generous courage, when they found and felt their error, honourably and fairly to di&s;claim. By &s;uch management, by the irre&s;i&s;tible operation of &s;ceble councils, &s;o paltry a &s;um as three-pence in the eyes of a financier, &s;o in&s;ignificant an article as tea in the eyes of a philo&s;opher, have &s;haken the pillars of a commercial empire that circled the whole globe.</P>
<P>Do you forget that, in the very la&s;t year, you &s;tood on the precipice of general bankruptcy? Your danger was indeed great. You were di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed in the affairs of the Ea&s;t India company; and you well know what &s;ort of things are involved in the comprehen&s;ive energy of that &s;ignificant apella|tion.
<PB N="275" REF="275">
I am not called upon to enlarge to you on that danger, which you thought proper your&s;elves to aggravate, and to di&s;play to the world with all the parade of indi&s;creet declamation. The mono|poly of the mo&s;t lucrative trades, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of imperial revenues, had brought you to the verge of beggary and ruin. Such was your repre&s;entation&mdash;&s;uch, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, was your ca&s;e. The vent of ten millions of pounds of this commodity, now locked up by the operation of an injudicious tax, and rotting in the warehou&s;es of the company, would have prevented all this di&s;tre&s;s, and all that &s;eries of de&s;perate mea&s;ures which you thought your&s;elves obliged to take in con&s;equence of it. America would have furni&s;hed that vent, which no other part of the world can furni&s;h but America; where Tea is next to a nece&s;&s;ary of life; and where the demand grows upon the &s;upply. I hope our dear-bought Ea&s;t India committees have done us at lea&s;t &s;o much good, as to let us know, that without a more exten&s;ive &s;ale of that article our Ea&s;t India revenues and acqui&s;itions can have no certain connection with this country. It is through the American trade of tea that your Ea&s;t India conque&s;ts are to be prevented from cru&s;hing you with their burthen. They are ponde|rous indeed; and they mu&s;t have that great coun|try to lean upon, or they tumble upon your head. It is the &s;ame folly that has lo&s;t you at once the be|nefit of the We&s;t and of the Ea&s;t. This folly has thrown open folding-doors to contraband; and will be the means of giving the profits of the trade of your colonies, to every nation but your&s;elves. Never did a people &s;uffer &s;o much for the empty words of a preamble. It mu&s;t be given up. For on what principle does it &s;tand? This famous re|venue &s;tands, at this hour, on all the debate, as a de&s;cription of revenue not as yet known in all the comprehen&s;ive (but too comprehen&s;ive!) vocabu|lary of finance&mdash;<HI>a preambulary tax.</HI> It is indeed a
<PB N="276" REF="276">
tax of &s;ophi&s;try, a tax of pedantry, a tax of di&s;pu|tation, a tax of war and rebellion, a tax for any thing but benefit to the impo&s;ers, or &s;atisfaction to the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WELL! but whatever it is, gentlemen will force the coloni&s;ts to take the Teas. You will force them? has &s;even years &s;truggle been yet able to force them? Oh, but it &s;eems
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"we are in the right.&mdash;The tax is trifling&mdash;in effect it is rather an ex|oneration than an impo&s;ition; three-fourths of the duty formerly payable on Teas exported to America is taken off; the place of collection is only &s;hifted; in&s;tead of the retention of a &s;hil|ling from the draw-back here, it is three-pence cu&s;tom paid in America."</Q>
All this, &s;ir, is very true. But this is the very folly and mi&s;chief of the act. Incredible as it may &s;eem, you know that you have deliberately thrown away a large duty which you held &s;ecure and quiet in your hands, for the vain hope of getting one three-fourths le&s;s, through every hazard, through certain litigation, and po&s;&s;i|bly through war.</P>
<P>THE manner of proceeding in the duties on pa|per and gla&s;s, impo&s;ed by the &s;ame act, was ex|actly in the &s;ame &s;pirit. There are heavy exci&s;es on tho&s;e articles when u&s;ed in England. On ex|port the&s;e exci&s;es are drawn back. But in&s;tead of withholding the draw-back, which might have been done, with ea&s;e, without charge, without po&s;&s;ibility of &s;muggling; and in&s;tead of applying the money (money already in your hands) according to your plea&s;ure, you began your operations in finance by flinging away your revenue; you allowed the whole draw-back on export, and then you charged the duty, (which you had before di&s;charged,) pay|able in the colonies; where it was certain the col|lection
<PB N="277" REF="277">
would devour it to the bone; if any revenue were ever &s;uffered to be collected at all. One &s;pirit pervades and animates the whole ma&s;s.</P>
<P>COULD any thing be a &s;ubject of more ju&s;t alarm to America, than to &s;ee you go out of the plain high road of finance, and give up your mo&s;t cer|tain revenues and your cleare&s;t intere&s;ts, merely for the &s;ake of in&s;ulting your colonies? No man ever doubted that the commodity of Tea could bear an impo&s;ition of three-pence. But no com|modity will bear three-pence, or will bear a penny, when the general feelings of men are irritated, and two millions of people are re&s;olved not to pay. The feelings of the Colonies were formerly the feelings of Great Britain. Theirs were formerly the feelings of Mr. Hampden when called upon for the payment of twenty &s;hillings. Would twenty &s;hillings have ruined Mr. Hampden's for|tune? No! but the payment of half twenty &s;hil|lings, on the principle it was demanded, would have made him a &s;lave, It is the weight of that preamble, of which you are &s;o fond, and not the weight of the duty, that the Americans are unable and unwilling to bear.</P>
<P>IT is then, &s;ir, upon the <HI>principle</HI> of this mea&s;ure, and nothing el&s;e, that we are at i&s;&s;ue. It is a prin|ciple of political expediency. Your act of 1767 a&s;&s;erts, that it is expedient to rai&s;e a revenue in America; your act of 1769, which takes away that revenue, contradicts the act of 1767; and, by &s;omething much &s;tronger than words, a&s;&s;erts, that it is not expedient. It is a reflection upon your wi&s;dom to per&s;i&s;t in a &s;olemn parliamentary declaration of the expediency of any object, for which, at the &s;ame time, you make no &s;ort of pro|vi&s;ion. And pray, &s;ir, let not this circum&s;tance e&s;|cape you; it is very material; that the preamble of
<PB N="278" REF="278">
this act, which we wi&s;h to repeal, is not <HI>declaratory of a right,</HI> as &s;ome gentlemen &s;eem to argue it; it is only a recital of the <HI>expediency</HI> of a certain exer|ci&s;e of a right &s;uppo&s;ed already to have been a&s;|&s;erted; an exerci&s;e you are now contending for by ways and means, which you confe&s;s, though they were obeyed, to be utterly in&s;ufficient for their purpo&s;e. You are therefore at this moment in the aukward &s;ituation of fighting for a phantom; a quiddity; a thing that wants, not only a &s;ub&s;tance, but even a name; for a thing, which is neither ab|&s;tract right, nor profitable enjoyment.</P>
<P>THEY tell you, &s;ir, that your dignity is tied to it. I know not how it happens, but this dignity of yours is a terrible incumbrance to you; for it has of late been ever at war with your intere&s;t, your equity, and every idea of your policy. Shew the thing you contend for to be rea&s;on; &s;hew it to be common &s;en&s;e; &s;hew it to be the means of attain|ing &s;ome u&s;eful end; and then I am content to al|low it what dignity you plea&s;e. But what dignity is derived from the per&s;everance in ab&s;urdity is more than ever I could di&s;cern. The hon. gentle|man has &s;aid well&mdash;indeed, in mo&s;t of his <HI>general</HI> ob&s;ervations I agree with him&mdash;he &s;ays, that this &s;ubject does not &s;tand as it did formerly. Oh, certainly not! every hour you continue on this ill|cho&s;en ground, your difficulties thicken on you; and therefore my conclu&s;ion is, remove from a bad po&s;ition as quickly as you can. The di&s;grace, and the nece&s;&s;ity of yielding, both of them, grow upon you every hour of your delay.</P>
<P>BUT will you repeal the act, &s;ays the hon. gen|tleman, at this in&s;tant when America is in open re&s;i&s;tance to your authority, and that you have ju&s;t revived your &s;y&s;tem of taxation? He thinks he has driven us into a corner. But thus pent up, I am
<PB N="279" REF="279">
content to meet him; becau&s;e I enter the li&s;ts &s;up|ported by my old authority, his new friends, the mini&s;ters them&s;elves. The hon. gentleman re|members, that about five years ago as great di&s;|turbances as the pre&s;ent prevailed in America on account of the new taxes. The mini&s;ters repre|&s;ented the&s;e di&s;turbances as trea&s;onable; and this hou&s;e thought proper, on that repre&s;entation, to make a famous addre&s;s for a revival, and for a new application, of a &s;tatute of H. VIII. We be|&s;ought the king, in that well-con&s;idered addre&s;s, to inquire into trea&s;ons, and to bring the &s;uppo&s;ed traitors from America to Great Britain for trial. His maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to promi&s;e a compliance with our reque&s;t. All the attempts from this &s;ide of the hou&s;e to re&s;i&s;t the&s;e violences, and to bring about a repeal, were treated with the ut|mo&s;t &s;corn. An apprehen&s;ion of the very con&s;e|quences now &s;tated by the hon. gentleman, was then given as a rea&s;on for &s;hutting the door again&s;t all hope of &s;uch an alteration. And &s;o &s;trong was the &s;pirit for &s;upporting the new taxes, that the &s;e&s;&s;ion concluded with the following remarkable declaration. After &s;tating the vigorous mea&s;ures which had been pur&s;ued, the &s;peech from the throne proceeds:</P>

by the public promi&s;e of a peer relative to the re|peal of taxes by this hou&s;e. I pa&s;s by the u&s;e of the king's name in a matter of &s;upply, that &s;acred and re&s;erved right of the commons. I conceal the ridiculous figure of parliament, hurling its thunders at the gigantic rebellion of America; and then five days after, pro&s;trate at the feet of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies we affected to de&s;pi&s;e; begging them, by the intervention of our mini&s;terial &s;ureties, to receive our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and heartily promi&s;ing amendment.

Pa&s;&s;ing, therefore, from the con&s;titutional con&s;ideration to the mere policy, does not this let|ter imply, that the idea of taxing America for the purpo&s;e of revenue is an abominable project; when the mini&s;try &s;uppo&s;e none but <HI>factious</HI> men, and with &s;editious views, could charge them with it? does not this letter adopt and &s;anctify the American di&s;tinction of <HI>taxing for a revenue?</HI> does it not formally reject all future taxation on that principle? does it not &s;tate the mini&s;terial rejection of &s;uch principle of taxation, not as the occa&s;ional, but the con&s;tant opinion of the king's &s;ervants? does it not &s;ay (I care not how con&s;i&s;tently), but does it not &s;ay, that their conduct with regard to America has been <HI>always</HI> governed by this policy?

It was the letter of the noble lord upon the floor,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> and of all the king's then mini&s;ters, who (with I think the exception of two only) are his mini&s;ters at this hour. The very fir&s;t news that a Briti&s;h parli|ament heard of what it was to do with the duties which it had given and granted to the king, was by the publication of the votes of American a&s;&s;em|blies. It was in America that your re&s;olutions were pre-declared. It was from thence that we knew to a certainty, how much exactly, and not a &s;cruple more or le&s;s, we were to repeal.

<P>IF this dignity, which is to &s;tand in the place of ju&s;t policy and common &s;en&s;e, had been con&s;ulted, there was a time for pre&s;erving it, and for recon|ciling it with any conce&s;&s;ion. If in the &s;e&s;&s;ion of 1768, that &s;e&s;&s;ion of idle terror and empty me|naces, you had, as you were often pre&s;&s;ed to do, repealed the&s;e taxes; then your &s;trong operations would have come ju&s;tified and enforced, in ca&s;e your conce&s;&s;ions had been returned by outrages. But, prepo&s;terou&s;ly, you began with violence; and before terrors could have any effect, either good or bad, your mini&s;ters immediately begged pardon, and promi&s;ed that repeal to the ob&s;tinate Americans which they had refu&s;ed in an ea&s;y, good-natured, complying Briti&s;h parliament. The a&s;&s;emblies, which had been publicly and avowedly di&s;&s;olved for <HI>their</HI> contumacy, are called together to receive <HI>your</HI> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. Your mini&s;terial di|rectors blu&s;tered like tragic tyrants here; and then went mumping with a &s;ore leg in America, cant|ing, and whining, and complaining of faction, which repre&s;ented them as friends to a revenue from the colonies. I hope nobody in this hou&s;e will hereafter have the impudence to defend Ame|rican taxes in the name of mini&s;try. The mo|ment they do, with this letter of attorney in my hand, I will tell them, in the authori&s;ed terms, they are wretches,

<P><PB N="285" REF="285">AFTER this letter, the que&s;tion is no more on propriety or dignity. They are gone already. The faith of your &s;overeign is pledged for the po|litical principle. The general declaration in the letter goes to the whole of it. You mu&s;t therefore either abandon the &s;cheme of taxing; or you mu&s;t &s;end the mini&s;ters tarred and feathered to America; who dared to hold out the royal faith for a renun|ciation of all taxes for revenue.

<P>SIR, if rea&s;ons re&s;pecting &s;imply your own com|merce, which is your own convenience, were the &s;ole grounds of the repeal of the five duties; why does lord Hill&s;borough, in di&s;claiming in the name of the king and mini&s;try their ever had having an intent to tax for revenue, mention it as the means
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the confidence and affection of the colonies?"</Q>
Is it a way of &s;oothing <HI>others,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure them that you will take good care of <HI>your&s;elf?</HI> The medium, the only medium, for regaining their affection and confidence, is, that you will
<PB N="286" REF="286">
take off &s;omething oppre&s;&s;ive to their minds. Sir, the letter &s;trongly enforces that idea; for though the repeal of the taxes is promi&s;ed on commercial principles, yet the means of counteracting
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the in&s;inuations of men with factious and &s;editious views,"</Q>
is by a di&s;claimer of the intention of taxing for revenue, as a con&s;tant invariable &s;enti|ment and rule of conduct in the government of America.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER that the noble lord on the floor, not in a former debate to be &s;ure (it would be di&s;orderly to refer to it, I &s;uppo&s;e I read it &s;ome|where), but the noble lord was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that he did not conceive how it could enter into the head of man to impo&s;e &s;uch taxes as tho&s;e of 1767; I mean tho&s;e taxes which he voted for impo&s;ing, and voted for repealing; as being taxes, contrary to all the principles of commerce, laid on <HI>Briti&s;h manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>I DARE &s;ay the noble lord is perfectly well read, becau&s;e the duty of his particular office requires he &s;hould be &s;o, in all our revenue laws; and in the policy which is to be collected out of them. Now, &s;ir, when he had read this act of American reve|nue, and a little recovered from his a&s;toni&s;hment, I &s;uppo&s;e he made one &s;tep retrograde (it is but one) and looked at the act which &s;tands ju&s;t before in the &s;tatute book. The American revenue act is the forty-fifth chapter; the other to which I refer is the forty-fourth of the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion. The&s;e two acts are both to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; both revenue acts; both taxing out of the kingdom; and both taxing Briti&s;h manufactures exported. As the 45th is an act for rai&s;ing a revenue in America, the 44th is an act for rai&s;ing a revenue in the I&s;le of Man. The two acts perfectly agree in all re&s;pects, except one. In the act for taxing the I&s;le of Man, the
<PB N="287" REF="287">
noble lord will find (not, as in the American act, four or five articles) but almo&s;t the <HI>whole body</HI> of Briti&s;h manufactures, taxed from two and an half to fifteen <HI>per cent.</HI> and &s;ome articles, &s;uch as that of &s;pirits, a great deal higher. You did not think it uncommercial to tax the whole ma&s;s of your ma|nufactures, and, let me add, your agriculture too; for, I now recollect, Briti&s;h corn is there al&s;o taxed up to ten <HI>per cent.</HI> and this too in the very head|quarters, the very citadel of &s;muggling, the I&s;le of Man. Now will the noble lord conde&s;cend to tell me why he repealed the taxes on your manufac|tures &s;ent out to America, and not the taxes on the manufactures exported to the I&s;le of Man? The principle was exactly the &s;ame, the objects charged infinitely more exten&s;ive, the duties with|out compari&s;on higher. Why? why, notwith|&s;tanding all his childi&s;h pretexts, becau&s;e the taxes were quietly &s;ubmitted to in the I&s;le of Man; and becau&s;e they rai&s;ed a flame in America. Your rea&s;ons were political, not commercial. The re|peal was made, as lord Hill&s;borough's letter well expre&s;&s;es it, to regain
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the confidence and affec|tion of the colonies, on which the glory and &s;afety of the Briti&s;h empire depend."</Q>
A wi&s;e and ju&s;t motive &s;urely, if ever there was &s;uch. But the mi&s;chief and di&s;honour is, that you have not done what you had given the colonies ju&s;t cau&s;e to expect, when your mini&s;ters di&s;claimed the idea of taxes for a revenue. There is nothing &s;imple, nothing manly, nothing ingenuous, open, deci|&s;ive, or &s;teady, in the proceeding, with regard either to the continuance or the repeal of the taxes. The whole has an air of littlene&s;s and fraud. The article of tea is &s;lurred over in the circular letter, as it were by accident&mdash;nothing is &s;aid of a re&s;olu|tion either to keep that tax, or to give it up. There is no fair dealing in any part of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="288">IF you mean to follow your true motive and your public faith, give up your tax on tea for rai&s;|ing a revenue, the principle of which has, in effect, been di&s;claimed in your name; and which produces you no advantages; no, not a penny. Or, if you choo&s;e to go on with a poor pretence in&s;tead of a &s;olid rea&s;on, and will &s;till adhere to your cant of commerce, you have ten thou&s;and times more &s;trong commercial rea&s;ons for giving up this duty on tea, than for abandoning the five others that you have already renounced.</P>
<P>THE American con&s;umption of teas is annually, I believe, worth 300,000l. at the lea&s;t farthing. If you urge the American violence as a ju&s;tification of your per&s;everance in enforcing this tax, you know that you can never an&s;wer this plain que&s;tion&mdash;Why did you repeal the others given in the &s;ame act, whil&s;t the very &s;ame violence &s;ub&s;i&s;ted? But you did not find the violence cea&s;e upon that conce&s;&s;ion.&mdash;No! becau&s;e the conce&s;&s;ion was far &s;hort of &s;atisfy|ing the principle which lord Hill&s;borough had ab|jured; or even the pretence on which the repeal of the other taxes was announced: and becau&s;e, by enabling the Ea&s;t India company to open a &s;hop for defeating the American re&s;olution not to pay that &s;pecific tax, you manife&s;tly &s;hewed a hanker|ing after the principle of the act which you for|merly had renounced. Whatever road you take leads to a compliance with this motion. It opens to you at the end of every vi&s;ta. Your commerce, your policy, your promi&s;es, your rea&s;ons, your pretences, your con&s;i&s;tency, your incon&s;i&s;tency&mdash;all jointly oblige you to this repeal.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till it &s;ticks in our throats, if we go &s;o far, the Americans will go farther.&mdash;We do not know that. We ought, from experience, rather to pre|&s;ume the contrary. Do we not know for certain,
<PB N="289" REF="289">
that the Americans are going on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, whil&s;t we refu&s;e to gratify them? can they do more, or can they do wor&s;e, if we yield this point? I think this conce&s;&s;ion will rather fix a turnpike to prevent their further progre&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;ible to an&s;wer for bodies of men. But I am &s;ure the na|tural effect of fidelity, clemency, kindne&s;s in go|vernors, is peace, good-will, order, and e&s;teem, on the part of the governed. I would certainly, at lea&s;t, give the&s;e fair principles a fair trial; which, &s;ince the making of this act to this hour, they ne|ver have had.</P>
<P>SIR, The hon. gentleman having &s;poken what he thought nece&s;&s;ary upon the narrow part of the &s;ubject, I have given him, I hope, a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer. He next pre&s;&s;es me by a variety of direct challenges and oblique reflexions to &s;ay &s;omething on the hi&s;torical part. I &s;hall therefore, &s;ir, open my&s;elf fully on that important and delicate &s;ubject; not for the &s;ake of telling you a long &s;tory (which, I know, Mr. Speaker, you are not particularly fond of), but for the &s;ake of the weighty in&s;truction that, I flatter my&s;elf, will nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from it. It &s;hall not be longer, if I can help it, than &s;o &s;erious a matter requires.</P>
<P>PERMIT me then, &s;ir, to lead your attention very far back; back to the act of navigation; the corner-&s;tone of the policy of this country with regard to its colonies. Sir, that policy was, from the be|ginning, purely commercial; and the commercial &s;y&s;tem was wholly re&s;trictive. It was the &s;y&s;tem of a monopoly. No trade was let loo&s;e from that con|&s;traint, but merely to enable the coloni&s;ts to di&s;po&s;e of what, in the cour&s;e of your trade, you could not take; or to enable them to di&s;po&s;e of &s;uch articles as we forced upon them, and for which, without &s;ome degree of liberty, they could not pay. Hence all
<PB N="290" REF="290">
your &s;pecific and detailed enumerations: hence the innumerable checks and counter-checks: hence that infinite variety of paper chains by which you bind together this complicated &s;y&s;tem of the Colonies. This principle of commercial monopoly runs through no le&s;s than twenty-nine acts of parliament, from the year 1660 to the unfortunate period of 1764.</P>
<P>IN all tho&s;e acts the &s;y&s;tem of commerce is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, as that, from whence alone you propo&s;ed to make the Colonies contribute (I mean directly and by the operation of your &s;uperintending legi&s;|lative power) to the &s;trength of the empire. I ven|ture to &s;ay, that during that whole period, a parlia|mentary revenue from thence was never once in contemplation. Accordingly in all the number of laws pa&s;&s;ed with regard to the plantations, the words which di&s;tingui&s;h revenue laws, &s;pecifically as &s;uch, were, I think, premeditately avoided. I do not &s;ay, &s;ir, that a form of words alters the nature of the law, or abridges the power of the lawgiver. It certainly does not. However, titles and formal preambles are not always idle words; and the law|yers frequently argue from them. I &s;tate the&s;e facts to &s;hew, not what was your right, but what has been your &s;ettled policy. Our revenue laws have u&s;ually a <HI>title,</HI> purporting their being <HI>grants</HI>; and the words <HI>give and grant</HI> u&s;ually precede the enacting parts. Although duties were impo&s;ed on America in acts of king Charles the &s;econd, and in acts of king William, no one title of giving
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"an aid to his maje&s;ty,"</Q>
or any other of the u&s;ual titles to revenue acts, was to be found in any of them till 1764; nor were the words
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"give and grant"</Q>
in any preamble until the 6th of George the &s;econd.
However, the title of this act of George the &s;econd, notwith&s;tanding the words of
<PB N="291" REF="291">
donation, con&s;iders it merely as a regulation of trade,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"An act for the better &s;ecuring of the trade of his maje&s;ty's &s;ugar colonies in America."</Q>
This act was made on a compromi&s;e of all, and at the expre&s;s de&s;ire of a part, of the colonies them|&s;elves. It was therefore in &s;ome mea&s;ure with their con&s;ent; and having a title directly purporting only a <HI>commercial regulation,</HI> and being in truth nothing more, the words were pa&s;&s;ed by, at a time when no jealou&s;y was entertained, and things were little &s;crutinized. Even governor Bernard, in his &s;econd printed letter, dated in 1763, gives it as his opinion, that, <Q REND="inline">"it was an act of <HI>prohibition,</HI> not of revenue."</Q> This is certainly true; that no act avowedly for the purpo&s;e of revenue, and with the ordinary title and recital taken together, is found in the &s;tatute book until the year I have mentioned; that is, the year 1764. All before this period &s;tood on commercial regulation and re&s;traint. The &s;cheme of a colony revenue by Briti&s;h authority appeared therefore to the Americans in the light of a great innovation. The words of governor Bernard's ninth letter, written in November 1765, &s;tate this idea very &s;trongly; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it mu&s;t," &s;ays he,
"have been &s;up|po&s;ed, <HI>&s;uch an innovation as a parliamentary taxa|tion,</HI> would cau&s;e a great <HI>alarm,</HI> and meet with much <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> in mo&s;t parts of America; it was <HI>quite new</HI> to the people, and had no <HI>vi&s;ible bounds</HI> &s;et to it."</Q>
After &s;tating the weakne&s;s of govern|ment there, he &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was this a time to introduce <HI>&s;o great a novelty</HI> as a parliamentary inland taxa|tion in America?"</Q>
Whatever the right might have been, this mode of u&s;ing it was ab&s;olutely new in policy and practice.</P>
<P>SIR, they who are friends to the &s;chemes of American revenue &s;ay, that the commercial re|&s;traint is full as hard a law for America to live un|der.
<PB N="292" REF="292">
I think &s;o too. I think it, if uncompen&s;ated, to be a condition of as rigorous &s;ervitude as men can be &s;ubject to. But America bore it from the fundamental act of navigation until 1764.&mdash;Why? Becau&s;e men do bear the inevitable con&s;titution of original nature with all its infirmities. The act of navigation attended the Colonies from their infan|cy, grew with their growth, and &s;trengthened with their &s;trength. They were confirmed in obedience to it, even more by u&s;age than by law. They &s;carcely had remembered a time when they were not &s;ubject to &s;uch re&s;traint. Be&s;ides, they were indemnified for it by a pecuniary compen&s;ation. Their monopoli&s;t happened to be one of the riche&s;t men in the world. By his immen&s;e capital (prima|rily employed, not for their benefit, but his own) they were enabled to proceed with their fi&s;heries, their agriculture, their &s;hip-building (and their trade too within the limits), in &s;uch a manner as got far the &s;tart of the &s;low languid operations of una&s;&s;i&s;ted nature. This capital was a hot-bed to them. Nothing in the hi&s;tory of mankind is like their progre&s;s. For my part, I never ca&s;t an eye on their flouri&s;hing commerce, and their cultivated and commodious life, but they &s;eem to me rather ancient nations grown to perfection through a long &s;eries of fortunate events, and a train of &s;ucce&s;sful indu&s;try, accumulating wealth in many centuries, than the Colonies of ye&s;terday; than a &s;et of mi&s;e|rable out-ca&s;ts, a few years ago, not &s;o much &s;ent as thrown out, on the bleak and barren &s;hore of a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s three thou&s;and miles from all ci|vilized intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>ALL this was done by England, whil&s;t England pur&s;ued trade, and forgot revenue. You not only acquired commerce, but you actually created the very objects of trade in America; and by that
<PB N="293" REF="293">
creation you rai&s;ed the trade of this kingdom at lea&s;t four-fold. America had the compen&s;ation of your capital, which made her bear her &s;ervitude. She had another compen&s;ation, which you are now going to take away from her. She had, except the commercial re&s;traint, every characteri&s;tic mark of a free people in all her internal concerns. She had the image of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. She had the &s;ub&s;tance. She was taxed by her own repre|&s;entatives. She cho&s;e mo&s;t of her own repre&s;enta|tives. She paid them all. She had in effect the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of her own internal government. This whole &s;tate of commercial &s;ervitude and civil liber|ty, taken together, is certainly not perfect free|dom; but, comparing it with the ordinary circum|&s;tances of human nature, it was an happy and a liberal condition.</P>
<P>I KNOW, &s;ir, that great and not un&s;ucce&s;sful pains have been taken to inflame our minds by an outery, in this hou&s;e and out of it, that in America the act of navigation neither is, or ever was, obey|ed. But if you take the colonies through, I affirm, that its authority never was di&s;puted; that it was no where di&s;puted for any length of time; and on the whole, that it was well ob&s;erved. Wherever the act pre&s;&s;ed hard, many individuals indeed evaded it. This is nothing. The&s;e &s;cattered indi|viduals never denied the law, and never obeyed it. Ju&s;t as it happens whenever the laws of trade, whenever the laws of revenue, pre&s;s hard upon the people in England; in that ca&s;e all your &s;hores are full of contraband. Your right to give a mo|nopoly to the Ea&s;t India company, your right to lay immen&s;e duties on French brandy, are not di&s;puted in England. You do not make this charge on any man. But you know that there is not a creek from Pentland Frith to the I&s;le of Wight,
<PB N="294" REF="294">
in which they do not &s;muggle immen&s;e quantities of Teas, Ea&s;t India goods, and brandies. I take it for granted, that the authority of governor Bernard in this point is indi&s;putable. Speaking of the&s;e laws, as they regarded that part of America now in &s;o unhappy a condition, he &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I believe they are no where better &s;upported than in this province: I do not pretend that it is entirely free from a breach of the&s;e laws; but that &s;uch a breach, if di&s;covered, is ju&s;tly puni&s;hed."</Q>
What more can you &s;ay of the obedience to any laws in any coun|try? An obedience to the&s;e laws formed the ac|knowledgment, in&s;tituted by your&s;elves, for your &s;uperiority; and was the payment you originally impo&s;ed for your protection.</P>
<P>WHETHER you were right or wrong in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the colonies on the principles of commer|cial monopoly, rather than on that of revenue, is at this day a problem of mere &s;peculation. You can|not have both by the &s;ame authority. To join to|gether the re&s;traints of an univer&s;al internal and ex|ternal monopoly, with an univer&s;al internal and ex|ternal taxation, is an unnatural union; perfect un|compen&s;ated &s;lavery. You have long &s;ince decid|ed for your&s;elf and them; and you and they have pro&s;pered exceedingly under that deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS nation, &s;ir, never thought of departing from that choice until the period immediately on the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war. Then a &s;cheme of go|vernment new in many things &s;eemed to have been adopted. I &s;aw, or thought I &s;aw, &s;everal &s;ymptoms of a great change, whil&s;t I &s;at in your gallery, a good while before I had the honour of a &s;eat in this hou&s;e. At that period the nece&s;&s;ity was e&s;tabli&s;hed of keeping up no le&s;s than twenty new regiments, with twenty colonels capable of &s;eats in this hou&s;e. This &s;cheme was adopted with very
<PB N="295" REF="295">
general applau&s;e from all &s;ides, at the very time that, by your conque&s;ts in America, your danger from foreign attempts in that part of the world was much le&s;&s;ened, or indeed rather quite over. When this huge increa&s;e of military e&s;tabli&s;hment was re|&s;olved on, a revenue was to be found to &s;upport &s;o great a burthen. Country gentlemen, the great patrons of oeconomy, and the great re&s;i&s;ters of a &s;tanding armed force, would not have entered with much alacrity into the vote for &s;o large and &s;o expen&s;ive an army, if they had been very &s;ure that they were to continue to pay for it. But hopes of another kind were held out to them; and in parti|cular, I well remember, that Mr. Town&s;hend, in a brilliant harangue on this &s;ubject, did dazzle them, by playing before their eyes the image of a reve|nue to be rai&s;ed in America.</P>
<P>HERE began to dawn the fir&s;t glimmerings of this new Colony &s;y&s;tem. It appeared more di&s;|tinctly afterwards, when it was devolved upon a per&s;on to whom, on other accounts, this country owes very great obligations. I do believe, that he had a very &s;erious de&s;ire to benefit the public. But with no &s;mall &s;tudy of the detail, he did not &s;eem to have his view, at lea&s;t equally, carried to the to|tal circuit of our affairs. He generally con&s;idered his objects in lights that were rather too detached. Whether the bu&s;ine&s;s of an American revenue was impo&s;ed upon him altogether; whether it was en|tirely the re&s;ult of his own &s;peculation; or, what is more probable, that his own ideas rather coincid|ed with the in&s;tructions he had received; certain it is, that, with the be&s;t intentions in the world, he fir&s;t brought this fatal &s;cheme into form, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed it by act of parliament.</P>
<P>NO man can believe, that at this time of day I mean to lean on the venerable memory of a great
<PB N="296" REF="296">
man, who&s;e lo&s;s we deplore in common. Our lit|tle party-differences have been along ago compo&s;|ed; and I have acted more with him, and certain|ly with more plea&s;ure with him, than ever I acted again&s;t him. Undoubtedly Mr. Grenville was a fir&s;t-rate figure in this country. With a ma&s;culine under&s;tanding, and a &s;tout and re&s;olute heart, he had an application undi&s;&s;ipated and unwearied. He took public bu&s;ine&s;s, not as a duty which he was to fulfil, but as a plea&s;ure he was to enjoy; and he &s;eemed to have no delight out of this hou&s;e, ex|cept in &s;uch things as &s;ome way related to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s that was to be done within it. If he was ambi|tious, I will &s;ay this for him, his ambition was of a noble and generous &s;train. It was to rai&s;e him&s;elf, not by the low pimping politics of a court, but to win his way to power, through the laborious grada|tions of public &s;ervice; and to &s;ecure to him&s;elf a well-earned rank in parliament, by a thorough knowledge of its con&s;titution, and a perfect prac|tice in all its bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>SIR, if &s;uch a man fell into errors, it mu&s;t be from defects not intrin&s;ical; they mu&s;t be rather &s;ought in the particular habits of his life; which, though they do not alter the ground-work of charac|ter, yet tinge it with their own hue. He was bred in a profe&s;&s;ion. He was bred to the law, which is, in my opinion, one of the fir&s;t and noble&s;t of human &s;ciences: a &s;cience which does more to quicken and invigorate the under&s;tanding, than all the other kinds of learning put together; but it is not apt, except in per&s;ons very happily born, to open and to liberalize the mind exactly in the &s;ame proporti|on. Pa&s;&s;ing from that &s;tudy he did not go very largely into the world; but plunged into bu&s;ine&s;s; I mean into the bu&s;ine&s;s of office; and the limited and fixed methods and forms e&s;tabli&s;hed there.
<PB N="297" REF="297">
Much knowledge is to be had undoubtedly in that line; and there is no knowledge which is not valu|able. But it may be truly &s;aid, that men too much conver&s;ant in office are rarely minds of re|markable enlargement. Their habits of office are apt to give them a turn to think the &s;ub&s;tance of bu&s;ine&s;s not to be much more important than the forms in which it is conducted. The&s;e forms are adapted to ordinary occa&s;ions; and therefore per|&s;ons who are nurtured in office do admirably well, as long as things go on in their common order; but when the high roads are broken up, and the waters out, when a new and troubled &s;cene is opened, and the file affords no precedent, then it is that a greater knowledge of mankind, and a far more exten&s;ive comprehen&s;ion of things, is requi|&s;ite than ever office gave, or than office can ever give. Mr. Grenville thought better of the wi&s;dom and power of human legi&s;lation than in truth it de|&s;erves. He conceived, and many conceived along with him, that the flouri&s;hing trade of this country was greatly owing to law and in&s;titution, and not quite &s;o much to liberty; for but too many are apt to believe regulation to be commerce, and taxes to be revenue. Among regulations, that which &s;tood fir&s;t in reputation was his idol. I mean the act of navigation. He has often profe&s;&s;ed it to be &s;o. The policy of that act is, I readily admit, in many re&s;pects well under&s;tood. But I do &s;ay, that, if the act be &s;uffered to run the full length of its prin|ciple, and is not changed and modified according to the change of times and the fluctuation of cir|cum&s;tances, it mu&s;t do great mi&s;chief, and fre|quently even defeat its own purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER the war, and in the la&s;t year of it, the trade of America had encrea&s;ed far beyond the &s;peculations of the mo&s;t &s;anguine imagination. It
<PB N="298" REF="298">
&s;welled out on every &s;ide. It filled all its proper channels to the brim. It overflowed with a rich redundance, and, breaking its banks on the right and on the left, it &s;pread out upon &s;ome places, where it was indeed improper, upon others where it was only irregular. It is the nature of all great|ne&s;s not to be exact; and great trade will always be attended with con&s;iderable abu&s;es. The con|traband will always keep pace in &s;ome mea&s;ure with the fair trade. It &s;hould &s;tand as a funda|mental maxim, that no vulgar precaution ought to be employed in the cure of evils, which are clo&s;ely connected with the cau&s;e of our pro&s;perity. Perhaps this great per&s;on turned his eyes &s;omewhat le&s;s than was ju&s;t, towards the incredible increa&s;e of the fair trade; and looked with &s;omething of too exqui&s;ite a jealou&s;y towards the contraband. He certainly felt a &s;ingular degree of anxiety on the &s;ubject; and even began to act from that pa&s;&s;ion earlier than is commonly imagined. For whil&s;t he was fir&s;t lord of the admiralty, though not &s;trictly called upon in his official line, he pre&s;ented a very &s;trong memorial to the lords of the trea&s;ury (my lord Bute was then at the head of the board) heavily complaining of the growth of the illicit commerce in America. Some mi&s;chief happened even at that time from this over-earne&s;t zeal. Much greater happened afterwards when it operated with greater power in the highe&s;t department of the finances. The bonds of the act of navigation were &s;traitened &s;o much, that America was on the point of having no trade, either contraband or le|gitimate. They found, under the con&s;truction and execution then u&s;ed, the act no longer tying but actually &s;trangling them. All this coming with new enumerations of commodities; with re|gulations which in a manner put a &s;top to the mu|tual coa&s;ting intercour&s;e of the colonies; with the
<PB N="299" REF="299">
appointment of courts of admiralty under various improper circum&s;tances; with a &s;udden extinc|tion of the paper currencies; with a compul&s;ory provi&s;ion for the quartering of &s;oldiers; the people of America thought them&s;elves proceeded again&s;t as delinquents, or at be&s;t as people under &s;u&s;picion of delinquency; and in &s;uch a manner as, they imagined, their recent &s;ervices in the war did not at all merit. Any of the&s;e innumerable regulati|ons, perhaps, would not have alarmed alone; &s;ome might be thought rea&s;onable; the multitude &s;truck them with terror.</P>
<P>BUT the grand manoeuvre in that bu&s;ine&s;s of new regulating the colonies, was the 15th act of the fourth of George III.; which, be&s;ides contain|ing &s;everal of the matters to which I have ju&s;t alluded, opened a new principle: and here pro|perly began the &s;econd period of the policy of this country with regard to the colonies; by which the &s;cheme of a regular plantation parliamentary reve|nue was adopted in theory, and &s;ettled in practice. A revenue not &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of, but &s;u|peradded to, a monopoly; which monopoly was enforced at the &s;ame time with additional &s;trictne&s;s, and the execution put into military hands.</P>
<P>THIS act, &s;ir, had for the fir&s;t time the title of <Q REND="inline">"granting duties in the colonies and plantations of America;"</Q> and for the fir&s;t time it was a&s;&s;erted in the preamble,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that it was <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> that a revenue &s;hould be rai&s;ed there."</Q>
Then came the technical words of <Q REND="inline">"giving and grant|ing;"</Q> and thus a complete American revenue act was made, in all the forms, and with a full avowal of the right, equity, policy, and even nece&s;&s;ity, of taxing the colonies, without any formal con&s;ent of theirs. There are contained al&s;o in the pre|amble to that act the&s;e very remarkable words&mdash;
<PB N="300" REF="300">
the commons, &amp;c.&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"being de&s;irous to make <HI>&s;ome</HI> provi&s;ion in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament <HI>to|wards</HI> rai&s;ing the &s;aid revenue."</Q>
By the&s;e words it appeared to the colonies, that this act was but a beginning of &s;orrows; that every &s;e&s;&s;ion was to produce &s;omething of the &s;ame kind; that we were to go on from day to day, in charging them with &s;uch taxes as we plea&s;ed, for &s;uch a military force as we &s;hould think proper. Had this plan been pur&s;ued, it was evident that the provincial a&s;&s;em|blies, in which the Americans felt all their portion of importance, and beheld their &s;ole image of freedom, were <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> annihilated. This ill pro&s;|pect before them &s;eemed to be boundle&s;s in extent, and endle&s;s in duration. Sir, they were not mi&s;|taken. The mini&s;try valued them&s;elves when this act pa&s;&s;ed, and when they gave notice of the &s;tamp act, that both of the duties came very &s;hort of their ideas of American taxation. Great was the applau&s;e of this mea&s;ure here. In England we cried out for new taxes on America, whil&s;t they cried out that they were nearly cru&s;hed with tho&s;e which the war and their own grants had brought upon them.</P>
<P>SIR, it has been &s;aid in the debate, that when the fir&s;t American revenue act (the act in 1764, impo&s;ing the port duties) pa&s;&s;ed, the Americans did not object to the principle. It is true they touched it but very tenderly. It was not a direct attack. They were, it is true, as yet novices; as yet unaccu&s;tomed to direct attacks upon any of the rights of parliament. The duties were port duties, like tho&s;e they had been accu&s;tomed to bear; with this difference, that the title was not the &s;ame, the preamble not the &s;ame, and the &s;pirit altogether unlike. But of what &s;ervice is this ob|&s;ervation to the cau&s;e of tho&s;e that make it? It is a
<PB N="301" REF="301">
full refutation of the pretence for their pre&s;ent cruelty to America; for it &s;hews, out of their own mouths, that our colonies were backward to enter into the pre&s;ent vexatious and ruinous controver&s;y.</P>
<P>THERE is al&s;o another circulation abroad, (&s;pread with a malignant intention, which I cannot attri|bute to tho&s;e who &s;ay the &s;ame thing in this hou&s;e) that Mr. Grenville gave the colony agents an option for their a&s;&s;emblies to tax them&s;elves, which they had refu&s;ed. I find that much &s;tre&s;s is laid on this, as a fact. However, it happens neither to be true nor po&s;&s;ible. I will ob&s;erve fir&s;t, that Mr. Gren|ville never thought fit to make this apology for him&s;elf in the innumerable debates that were had upon the &s;ubject. He might have propo&s;ed to the colony agents, that they &s;hould agree in &s;ome <HI>mode</HI> of taxation as the ground of an act of parlia|ment. But he never could have propo&s;ed that they &s;hould tax them&s;elves on requi&s;ition, which is the a&s;&s;ertion of the day. Indeed, Mr. Grenville well knew, that the colony agents could have no general powers to con&s;ent to it; and they had no time to con&s;ult their a&s;&s;emblies for particular pow|ers, before he pa&s;&s;ed his fir&s;t revenue act. If you compare dates, you will find it impo&s;&s;ible. Bur|thened as the agents knew the colonies were at that time, they could not give the lea&s;t hope of &s;uch grants. His own favourite governor was of opi|nion that the Americans were not then taxable objects:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"<HI>NOR was the time le&s;s favourable to the</HI> equity <HI>of &s;uch a taxation. I don't mean to di&s;pute the rea|&s;onablene&s;s of America contributing to the charges of Great Britain</HI> when &s;he is able<HI>; nor, I believe, would the Americans them&s;elves have di&s;puted it, at a</HI> proper time and &s;ea&s;on. <HI>But it &s;hould be con&s;idered, that the American governments them&s;elves have, in the pro|&s;ecution</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="302">
<HI>of the late war, contracted very large debts; which it will take &s;ome years to pay off, and in the mean time occa&s;ion very</HI> burden&s;ome taxes for that purpo&s;e <HI>only. For in&s;tance, this government, which is as much beforehand as any, rai&s;es every year 37,500l. &s;terling for &s;inking their debt, and mu&s;t con|tinue it for four years longer at lea&s;t before it will be clear.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>THESE are the words of governor Bernard's letter to a member of the old mini&s;try, and which he has &s;ince printed. Mr. Grenville could not have made this propo&s;ition to the agents, for ano|ther rea&s;on. He was of opinion, which he has de|clared in this hou&s;e an hundred times, that the co|lonies could not legally grant any revenue to the crown; and that infinite mi&s;chiefs would be the con&s;equence of &s;uch a power. When Mr. Gren|ville had pa&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t revenue act, and in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion had made this hou&s;e come to a re&s;olu|tion for laying a &s;tamp-duty on America; between that time and the pa&s;&s;ing the &s;tamp-act into a law, he told a con&s;iderable and mo&s;t re&s;pectable mer|chant, a member of this hou&s;e, whom I am truly &s;orry I do not now &s;ee in his place, when he re|pre&s;ented again&s;t this proceeding, that if the &s;tamp-duty was di&s;liked, he was willing to exchange it for any other equally productive; but that, if he objected to the Americans being taxed by parlia|ment, he might &s;ave him&s;elf the trouble of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as he was determined on the mea&s;ure. This is the fact, and, if you plea&s;e, I will mention a very unque&s;tionable authority for it.</P>
<P>THUS, &s;ir, I have di&s;po&s;ed of this fal&s;ehood. But fal&s;ehood has a perennial &s;pring. It is &s;aid, that no conjecture could be made of the di&s;like of the colonies to the principle. This is as untrue as the other. After the re&s;olution of the hou&s;e, and
<PB N="303" REF="303">
before the pa&s;&s;ing of the &s;tamp-act, the colonies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay and New York did &s;end remon|&s;trances, objecting to this mode of parliamentary taxation. What was the con&s;equence? They were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; they were put under the table; not|with&s;tanding an order of council to the contrary, by the mini&s;try which compo&s;ed the very council that had made the order; and thus the hou&s;e pro|ceeded to its bu&s;ine&s;s of taxing, without the lea&s;t regular knowledge of the objections which were made to it. But, to give that hou&s;e its due, it was not over-de&s;irous to receive information, or to hear remon&s;trance. On the 15th of February, 1765, whil&s;t the &s;tamp-act was under deliberation, they refu&s;ed with &s;corn even &s;o much as to receive four petitions pre&s;ented from &s;o re&s;pectable colonies as Connecticut, Rhode I&s;land, Virginia, and Carolina; be&s;ides one from the traders of Jamaica. As to the colonies, they had no alternative left to them, but to di&s;obey; or to pay the taxes impo&s;ed by that parliament which was not &s;uffered, or did not &s;uffer it&s;elf, even to hear them remon&s;trate upon the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>THIS was the &s;tate of the colonies before his ma|je&s;ty thought fit to change his mini&s;ters. It &s;tands upon no authority of mine. It is proved by un|controvertible records. The hon. gentleman has de&s;ired &s;ome of us to lay our hands upon our hearts, and an&s;wer to his queries upon the hi&s;torical part of this con&s;ideration; and by his manner (as well as my eyes could di&s;cern it) he &s;eemed to addre&s;s him&s;elf to me.</P>
<P>SIR, I will an&s;wer him as clearly as I am able, and with great openne&s;s: I have nothing to con|ceal. In the year &s;ixty-five, being in a very pri|vate &s;tation, far enough from any line of bu&s;ine&s;s, and not having the honour of a &s;eat in this hou&s;e,
<PB N="304" REF="304">
it was my fortune, unknowing and unknown to the then mini&s;try, by the intervention of a common friend, to become connected with a very noble per&s;on, and at the head of the trea&s;ury department. It was indeed in a &s;ituation of little rank and no con&s;equence, &s;uitable to the mediocrity of my ta|lents and preten&s;ions. But a &s;ituation near enough to enable me to &s;ee, as well as others, what was going on; and I did &s;ee in that noble per&s;on &s;uch &s;ound principles, &s;uch an enlargement of mind, &s;uch clear and &s;agacious &s;en&s;e, and &s;uch un&s;haken fortitude, as have bound me, as well as others much better than me, by an inviolable attachment to him from that time forward. Sir, lord Rocking|ham very early in that &s;ummer received a &s;trong repre&s;entation from many weighty Engli&s;h mer|chants and manufacturers, from governors of pro|vinces and commanders of men of war, again&s;t almo&s;t the whole of the American commercial re|gulations: and particularly with regard to the total ruin which was threatened to the Spani&s;h trade. I believe, &s;ir, the noble lord &s;oon &s;aw his way in this bu&s;ine&s;s. But he did not ra&s;hly determine again&s;t acts which it might be &s;uppo&s;ed were the re&s;ult of much deliberation. However, &s;ir, he &s;carcely be|gan to open the ground, when the whole veteran body of office took the alarm. A violent outcry of all (except tho&s;e who knew and felt the mi&s;|chief) was rai&s;ed again&s;t any alteration. On one hand, his attempt was a direct violation of treaties and public law.&mdash;On the other, the act of naviga|tion and all the corps of trade laws were drawn up in array again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;tep the noble lord took, was to have the opinion of his excellent, learned, and ever|lamented friend the late Mr. Yorke, then attorney general, on the point of law. When he knew
<PB N="305" REF="305">
that formally and officially, which in &s;ub&s;tance he had known before, he immediately di&s;patched or|ders to redre&s;s the grievance. But I will &s;ay it for the then mini&s;ter, he is of that con&s;titution of mind, that I know he would have i&s;&s;ued, on the &s;ame critical occa&s;ion, the very &s;ame orders, if the acts of trade had been, as they were not, directly again&s;t him: and would have chearfully &s;ubmit|ted to the equity of parliament for his indemnity.</P>
<P>ON the conclu&s;ion of this bu&s;ine&s;s of the Spani&s;h trade, the news of the troubles, on account of the &s;tamp-act, arrived in England. It was not until the end of October that the&s;e accounts were re|ceived. No &s;ooner had the &s;ound of that mighty tempe&s;t reached us in England, than the whole of the then oppo&s;ition, in&s;tead of feeling humbled by the unhappy i&s;&s;ue of their mea&s;ures, &s;eemed to be infinitely elated, and cried out, that the mini&s;try, from envy to the glory of their predece&s;&s;ors, were prepared to repeal the &s;tamp-act. Near nine years after, the hon. gentleman takes quite oppo&s;ite ground, and now challenges me to put my hand to my heart, and &s;ay, whether the mini&s;try had re|&s;olved on the repeal till a con&s;iderable time after the meeting of parliament. Though I do not very well know what the hon. gentleman wi&s;hes to infer from the admi&s;&s;ion, or from the denial, of this fact, on which he &s;o earne&s;tly adjures me; I do put my hand on my heart, and a&s;&s;ure him, that they did <HI>not</HI> come to a re&s;olution directly to repeal. They weighed this matter as its difficulty and importance required. They con&s;idered maturely among them|&s;elves. They con&s;ulted with all who could give advice or information. It was not determined until a little before the meeting of parliament; but it was determined, and the main lines of their own plan marked out, before that meeting. Two que&s;tions
<PB N="306" REF="306">
aro&s;e. (I hope I am not going into a narrative trou|ble&s;ome to the hou&s;e)</P>
<P>[A cry of, Go on, go on.]</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the two con&s;iderations was, whe|ther the repeal &s;hould be total, or whether only partial; taking out every thing burthen&s;ome and productive, and re&s;erving only an empty acknow|ledgment, &s;uch as a &s;tamp on cards and dice. The other que&s;tion was, On what principle the act &s;hould be repealed? On this head al&s;o two princi|ples were &s;tarted. One, that the legi&s;lative rights of this country, with regard to America, were not entire, but had certain re&s;trictions and limitations. The other principle was, that taxes of this kind were contrary to the fundamental principles of commerce on which the colonies were founded; and contrary to every idea of political equity; by which equity we are bound, as much as po&s;&s;ible to extend the &s;pirit and benefit of the Briti&s;h con&s;titu|tion to every part of the Briti&s;h dominions. The option, both of the mea&s;ure and of the principle of repeal, was made before the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and I wonder how any one can read the king's &s;peech at the opening of that &s;e&s;&s;ion, without &s;eeing in that &s;peech both the repeal and the declaratory act very &s;ufficiently crayoned out. Tho&s;e who cannot &s;ee this, can &s;ee nothing.</P>
<P>SURELY the hon. gentleman will not think that a great deal le&s;s time than was then employed, ought to have been &s;pent in deliberation; when he con|&s;iders that the news of the troubles did not arrive till towards the end of October. The parliament &s;at to fill the vacancies on the 14th day of December, and on bu&s;ine&s;s the 14th of the following Ja|nuary.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="307">SIR, a partial repeal, or, as the <HI>bon ton</HI> of court then was, a <HI>modification,</HI> would have &s;atisfied a ti|mid, un&s;y&s;tematic, procra&s;tinating mini&s;try, as &s;uch a mea&s;ure has &s;ince done &s;uch a mini&s;try. A modification is the con&s;tant re&s;ource of weak un|deciding minds. To repeal by a denial of our right to tax in the preamble (and this too did not want advi&s;ers), would have cut, in the heroic &s;tyle, the Gordian knot with a &s;word. Either mea&s;ure would have co&s;t no more than a day's debate. But when the total repeal was adopted; and a|dopted on principles of policy, of equity, and of commerce; this plan made it nece&s;&s;ary to enter into many and difficult mea&s;ures. It became ne|ce&s;&s;ary to open a very large field of evidence com|men&s;urate to the&s;e exten&s;ive views. But then this labour did knights &s;ervice. It opened the eyes of &s;everal to the true &s;tate of the American affairs; it enlarged their ideas; it removed prejudices; and it conciliated the opinions and affections of men. The noble lord, who then took the lead in admi|ni&s;tration, my hon. friend<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dowde&s;well.</NOTE> under me, and a right hon. gentleman<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE> (if he will not reject his &s;hare, and it was a large one, of this bu&s;ine&s;s) exerted the mo&s;t laudable indu&s;try in bringing before you the fulle&s;t, mo&s;t impartial, and lea&s;t-garbled body of evidence that ever was produced to this hou&s;e. I think the enquiry la&s;ted in the committee for &s;ix weeks; and at its conclu&s;ion this hou&s;e, by an in|dependent, noble, &s;pirited, and unexpected majo|rity; by a majority that will redeem all the acts ever done by majorities in parliament; in the teeth of all the old mercenary Swi&s;s of &s;tate, in de&s;pite of all the &s;peculators and augurs of political events, in defiance of the whole embattled legion of veteran pen&s;ioners and practi&s;ed in&s;truments of a court,
<PB N="308" REF="308">
gave a total repeal to the &s;tamp-act, and (if it had been &s;o permitted) a la&s;ting piece to this whole empire.</P>
<P>I STATE, &s;ir, the&s;e particulars, becau&s;e this act of &s;pirit and fortitude has lately been, in the circu|lation of the &s;ea&s;on, and in &s;ome hazarded declama|tions in this hou&s;e, attributed to timidity. If, &s;ir, the conduct of mini&s;try, in propo&s;ing the repeal, had ari&s;en from timidity with regard to them&s;elves, it would have been greatly to be condemned. In|tere&s;ted timidity di&s;graces as much in the cabinet, as per&s;onal timidity does in the field. But timidity, with regard to the well-being of our country, is he|roic virtue. The noble lord who then conducted affairs, and his worthy colleagues, whil&s;t they trembled at the pro&s;pect of &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es as you have &s;ince brought upon your&s;elves, were not afraid &s;teadily to look in the face that glaring and dazzling influence at which the eyes of eagles have blenched. He looked in the face one of the able&s;t, and, let me &s;ay, not the mo&s;t &s;crupulous oppo|&s;itions, that perhaps ever was in this hou&s;e, and with&s;tood it, unaided by, even one of, the u&s;ual &s;upports of admini&s;tration. He did this when he repealed the &s;tamp-act. He looked in the face a per&s;on he had long re&s;pected and regarded, and who&s;e aid was then particularly wanting; I mean lord Chatham. He did this when he pa&s;&s;ed the declaratory act.</P>
<P>IT is now given out, for the u&s;ual purpo&s;es, by the u&s;ual emi&s;&s;aries, that lord Rockingham did not con&s;ent to the repeal of this act until he was bullied into it by lord Chatham; and the reporters have gone &s;o far as publicly to a&s;&s;ert, in an hundred companies, that the hon. gentleman under the gal|lery,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE> who propo&s;ed the repeal in the American
<PB N="309" REF="309">
committee, had another &s;et of re&s;olutions in his pocket directly the rever&s;e of tho&s;e he moved. The&s;e artifices of a de&s;perate cau&s;e are, at this time, &s;pread abroad, with incredible care, in every part of the town, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t compa|nies; as if the indu&s;try of the circulation were to make amends for the ab&s;urdity of the report.</P>
<P>SIR, Whether the noble lord is of a complexion to be bullied by lord Chatham, or by any man, I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to tho&s;e who know him. I confe&s;s, when I look back to that time, I con&s;ider him as placed in one of the mo&s;t trying &s;ituations in which, perhaps, any man ever &s;tood. In the hou&s;e of peers there were very few of the mini&s;try, out of the no|ble lord's own particular connexion, (except lord Egmont, who acted, as far as I could di&s;cern, an honourable and manly part), that did not look to &s;ome other future arrangement, which warped his politics. There were in both hou&s;es new and me|nacing appearances, that might very naturally drive any other, than a mo&s;t re&s;olute mini&s;ter, from his mea&s;ure or from his &s;tation. The hou&s;ehold troops openly revolted. The allies of mini&s;try (tho&s;e, I mean, who &s;upported &s;ome of their mea&s;ures, but refu&s;ed re&s;pon&s;ibility for any) endeavoured to un|dermine their credit, and to take ground that mu&s;t be fatal to the &s;ucce&s;s of the very cau&s;e which they would be thought to countenance. The que&s;tion of the repeal was brought on by mini&s;try in the committee of this hou&s;e, in the very in&s;tant when it was known that more than one court negociation was carrying on with the heads of the oppo&s;ition. Every thing, upon every &s;ide, was full of traps and mines. Earth below &s;hook; heaven above me|naced; all the elements of mini&s;terial &s;afety were di&s;&s;olved. It was in the mid&s;t of this chaos of plots and counterplots; it was in the mid&s;t of this com|plicated
<PB N="310" REF="310">
warfare again&s;t public oppo&s;ition and pri|vate treachery, that the firmne&s;s of that noble per|&s;on was put to the proof. He never &s;tirred from his ground; no, not an inch. He remained fixed and determined, in principle, in mea&s;ure, and in con|duct. He practi&s;ed no managements. He &s;ecured no retreat. He &s;ought no apology.</P>
<P>I WILL likewi&s;e do ju&s;tice, I ought to do it, to the hon. gentleman who led us in this hou&s;e<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE>. Far from the duplicity wickedly charged on him, he acted his part with alacrity and re&s;olution. We all felt in&s;pired by the example he gave us, down even to my&s;elf, the weake&s;t in that phalanx. I declare for one, I knew well enough (it could not be con|cealed from any body) the true &s;tate of things: but, in my life, I never came with &s;o much &s;pirits into this hou&s;e. It was a time for a <HI>man</HI> to act in. We had powerful enemies; but we had faithful and determined friends; and a glorious cau&s;e. We had a great battle to fight; but we had the means of fighting; not as now, when our arms are tied behind us. We did fight that day and conquer.</P>
<P>I REMEMBER, &s;ir, with a melancholy plea&s;ure, the &s;ituation of the hon. gentleman<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE> who made the motion for the repeal; in that cri&s;is, when the whole trading intere&s;t of this empire, crammed into your lobbies, with a trembling and anxious expectation, waited, almo&s;t to a winter's return of light, their fate from your re&s;olutions. When, at length, you had determined in their favour, and your doors, thrown open, &s;hewed them the figure of their deli|verer in the well-earned triumph of his important victory, from the whole of that grave multitude there aro&s;e an involuntary bur&s;t of gratitude and tran&s;port. They jumped upon him like children
<PB N="311" REF="311">
on a long ab&s;ent father. They clung about him as captives about their redeemer. All England, all America, joined to his applau&s;e. Nor did he &s;eem in&s;en&s;ible to the be&s;t of all earthly rewards, the love and admiration of his fellow-citizens. <HI>Hope elevated and joy brightened his cre&s;t.</HI> I &s;tood near him; and his face, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of the &s;crip|ture of the fir&s;t martyr,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"his face was as if it had been the face of an angel."</Q>
I do not know how others feel; but if I had &s;tood in that &s;ituation, I ne|ver would have exchanged it for all that kings in their profu&s;ion could be&s;tow. I did hope, that that day's danger and honour would have been a bond to hold us all together for ever. But, alas! that, with other plea&s;ing vi&s;ions, is long &s;ince vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>SIR, this act of &s;upreme magnanimity has been repre&s;ented, as if it had been a mea&s;ure of an admi|ni&s;tration, that, having no &s;cheme of their own, took a middle line, pilfered a bit from one &s;ide and a bit from the other. Sir, they took <HI>no</HI> middle lines. They differed fundamentally from the &s;chemes of both parties; but they pre&s;erved the ob|jects of both. They pre&s;erved the authority of Great Britain. They pre&s;erved the equity of Great Britain. They made the declaratory act; they repealed the &s;tamp-act. They did both <HI>fully</HI>; be|cau&s;e the declaratory act was <HI>without qualification</HI>; and the repeal of the &s;tamp-act <HI>total.</HI> This they did in the &s;ituation I have de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>NOW, &s;ir, what will the adver&s;ary &s;ay to both the&s;e acts? If the principle of the declaratory act was not good, the principle we are contending for this day is mon&s;trous. If the principle of the repeal was not good, why are we not at war for a real &s;ub|&s;tantial effective revenue? If both were bad; why has this mini&s;try incurred all the inconveniencies of
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">General Conway.</NOTE>
<PB N="312" REF="312">
both and of all &s;chemes? Why have they enacted, repealed, enforced, yielded, and now attempt to enforce again?</P>
<P>SIR, I think I may as well now, as at any other time, &s;peak to a certain matter of fact not wholly unrelated to the que&s;tion under your con&s;ideration. We, who would per&s;uade you to revert to the an|cient policy of this kingdom, labour under the ef|fect of this &s;hort current phra&s;e, which the court leaders have given out to all their corps, in order to take away the credit of tho&s;e who would prevent you from that frantic war you are going to wage upon your Colonies. The cant is this;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"All the di&s;turbances in America have been created by the repeal of the &s;tamp-act."</Q>
I &s;uppre&s;s for a moment my indignation at the fal&s;ehood, ba&s;ene&s;s, and ab&s;urdity, of this mo&s;t audacious a&s;&s;ertion. In|&s;tead of remarking on the motives and character of tho&s;e who have i&s;&s;ued it for circulation, I will clear|ly lay before you the &s;tate of America, antecedent|ly to that repeal; after the repeal; and &s;ince the renewal of the &s;chemes of American taxation.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, that the di&s;turbances, if there were any, before the repeal, were &s;light; and without difficulty or inconvenience might have been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. For an an&s;wer to this a&s;&s;ertion I will &s;end you to the great author and patron of the &s;tamp-act, who, certainly meaning well to the authority of this country, and fully apprized of the &s;tate of that, made, before a repeal was &s;o much as agitated in this hou&s;e, the motion which is on your journals; and which, to &s;ave the clerk the trouble of turning to it, I will now read to you. It was for an amend|ment to the addre&s;s of the 17th of December 1765:</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="313"><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"TO <HI>expre&s;s our ju&s;t re&s;entment and indignation at the</HI> outrageous tumults and in&s;urrections <HI>which have been excited and carried on in North America; and at the re&s;i&s;tance given by</HI> open <HI>and</HI> rebellious <HI>force to the execution of the laws in that part of his maje&s;ty's dominions.

<P>HERE was certainly a di&s;turbance preceding the repeal; &s;uch a di&s;turbance as Mr. Grenville thought nece&s;&s;ary to qualify by the name of an <HI>in&s;urrection,</HI> and the epithet of a <HI>rebellious</HI> force: terms much &s;tronger than any, by which, tho&s;e who then &s;up|ported his motion, have ever &s;ince thought proper to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;turbances in Ameri|ca. They were di&s;turbances which &s;eemed to him and his friends to ju&s;tify as &s;trong a promi&s;e of &s;up|port, as hath been u&s;ual to give in the beginning of a war with the mo&s;t powerful and declared enemies. When the accounts of the American governors came before the hou&s;e, they appeared &s;tronger even than the warmth of public imagination had painted them; &s;o much &s;tronger, that the papers on your table bear me out in &s;aying, that all the late di&s;turbances, which have been at one time the mini&s;ter's motives for the repeal of five out of &s;ix of the new court taxes, and are now his pretences for refu&s;ing to repeal that &s;ixth, did not amount&mdash;why do I compare them? no, not to a tenth part of the tumults and violence which prevailed long before the repeal of that act.</P>
<P>MINISTRY cannot refu&s;e the authority of the commander in chief, general Gage, who, in his let|ter

Hear your officers abroad, and let them refute this &s;hamele&s;s fal&s;e|hood, who, in all their corre&s;pondence, &s;tate the di&s;turbances as owing to their true cau&s;es, the di&s;|content of the people, from the taxes. You have this evidence in your own archives&mdash;and it will give you compleat &s;atisfaction; if you are not &s;o far lo&s;t to all parliamentary ideas of information, as rather to credit the lye of the day, than the records of your own hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="315">SIR, this vermin of court reporters, when they are forced into day upon one point, are &s;ure to bur|row in another; but they &s;hall have no refuge: I will make them bolt out of all their holes. Con|&s;cious that they mu&s;t be baffled, when they attri|bute a precedent di&s;turbance to a &s;ub&s;equent mea|&s;ure, they take other ground, almo&s;t as ab&s;urd, but very common in modern practice, and very wick|ed; which is, to attribute the ill effect of ill-judged conduct to the arguments which had been u&s;ed to di&s;&s;uade us from it. They &s;ay that the oppo&s;ition made in parliament to the &s;tamp-act at the time of its pa&s;&s;ing, encouraged the Americans to their re|&s;i&s;tance. This has even formally appeared in print in a regular volume, from an advocate of that faction, a doctor Tucker. This doctor Tucker is already a dean, and his earne&s;t labours in this vineyard will, I &s;uppo&s;e, rai&s;e him to a bi&s;hopric. But this a&s;&s;er|tion too, ju&s;t like the re&s;t, is fal&s;e.

Far from any thing inflamma|tory, I never heard a more languid debate in this hou&s;e. No more than two or three gentlemen, as I remember, &s;poke again&s;t the act, and that with great re&s;erve and remarkable temper. There was but one divi&s;ion in the whole progre&s;s of the bill; and the minority did not reach to more than 39 or 40. In the hou&s;e of lords I do not recollect that there was any debate or divi&s;ion at all. I am &s;ure there was no prote&s;t. In fact, the affair pa&s;&s;ed with &s;o very, very little noi&s;e, that in town they &s;carcely knew the nature of what you were doing. The

<P>SIR, the agents and di&s;tributors of fal&s;ehoods have, with their u&s;ual indu&s;try, circulated another lye of the &s;ame nature with the former. It is this, that the di&s;turbances aro&s;e from the account which had been received in America of the change in the mini&s;try. No longer awed, it &s;eems, with the &s;pirit of the former rulers, they thought them&s;elves a match for what our calumniators choo&s;e to qua|lify by the name of &s;o feeble a mini&s;try as &s;ucceed|ed. Feeble in one &s;en&s;e the&s;e men certainly may be called; for, with all their efforts, and they have made many, they have not been able to re&s;i&s;t the di&s;tempered vigour and in&s;ane alacrity with which you are ru&s;hing to your ruin. But it does &s;o hap|pen, that the fal&s;ity of this circulation is (like the re&s;t) demon&s;trated by indi&s;putable dates and re|cords.</P>
<P>SO little was the change known in America, that the letters of your governors, giving an account of the&s;e di&s;turbances long after they had arrived at their highe&s;t pitch, were all directed to the <HI>old mi|ni&s;try,</HI> and particularly to the <HI>earl of Halifax,</HI> the &s;ecretary of &s;tate corre&s;ponding with the colonies, without once in the &s;malle&s;t degree intimating the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any mini&s;terial revolution what&s;oever. The mini&s;try was not changed in England until the tenth of July 1765. On the 14th of the preceding June, governor Fauquier from Virginia writes thus; and writes thus to the earl of Halifax:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Government is &s;et at</HI> defiance<HI>, not having &s;trength enough in her hands to enforce obedience to the laws of the community.&mdash;The pri|vate di&s;tre&s;s, which every man feels, encrea&s;es the</HI> general di&s;&s;atisfaction <HI>at the duties laid by the</HI>

<P>SIR, I have troubled you &s;ufficiently with the &s;tate of America before the repeal. Now I turn to the hon. gentleman who &s;o &s;toutly challenges us, to tell, whether, after the repeal, the provinces were quiet? This is coming home to the point. Here I meet him directly; and an&s;wer mo&s;t rea|dily, <HI>They were quiet.</HI> And I, in my turn, chal|lenge him to prove when, and where, and by whom, and in what numbers, and with what vio|lence, the other laws of trade, as gentlemen a&s;|&s;ert, were violated in con&s;equence of your conce&s;|&s;ion? or that even your other revenue laws were attacked? But I quit the vantage ground on which I &s;tand, and where I might leave the burthen of
<PB N="318" REF="318">
the proof upon him: I walk down upon the open plain, and undertake to &s;hew, that they were not only quiet, but &s;hewed many unequivocal marks of acknowledgment and gratitude. And to give him every advantage, I &s;elect the obnoxious colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay, which at this time (but with|out hearing her) is &s;o heavily a culprit before par|liament&mdash;I will &s;elect their proceedings even under circum&s;tances of no &s;mall irritation. For, a little imprudently I mu&s;t &s;ay, governor Bernard mixed in the admini&s;tration of the lenitive of the repeal no &s;mall acrimony ari&s;ing from matters of a &s;eparate nature. Yet &s;ee, &s;ir, the effect of that lenitive, though mixed with the&s;e bitter ingredients; and how the&s;e rugged people can expre&s;s them&s;elves on a mea&s;ure of conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>If it is not now in our power</HI>" (&s;ay they in their addre&s;s to governor Bernard)
"<HI>in &s;o full a manner as will be expected, to &s;hew our re&s;pectful gratitude to the mother country, or to make a dutiful and af|fectionate return to the indulgence of the king and parliament, it &s;hall be no fault of ours; for this we intend, and hope we &s;hall be able fully to effect.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>WOULD to God that this temper had been culti|vated, managed, and &s;et in action! other effect than tho&s;e which we have &s;ince felt would have re|&s;ulted from it.

They did con&s;ider; they did act upon it. They obeyed the requi&s;ition. I know the mode has been chicaned upon; but it was &s;ub&s;tantially obeyed; and much better obeyed, than I fear the parliamentary requi&s;ition of this

&s;e&s;&s;ion will be, though enforced by all your rigour, and backed with all your power. In a word, the damages of popular fury were compen&s;ated by le|gi&s;lative gravity. Almo&s;t every other part of Ame|rica in various ways demon&s;trated their gratitude. I am bold to &s;ay, that &s;o &s;udden a calm recovered after &s;o violent a &s;torm is without parallel in hi&s;tory. To &s;ay that no other di&s;turbance &s;hould happen from any other cau&s;e, is folly.

I &s;peak with the free|dom of hi&s;tory, and I hope without offence. One or two of the&s;e maxims, flowing from an opinion not the mo&s;t indulgent to our unhappy &s;pecies, and &s;urely a little too general, led him into mea|&s;ures that were greatly mi&s;chievous to him&s;elf; and for that rea&s;on, among others, perhaps fatal to his country; mea&s;ures, the effects of which, I am afraid, are for ever incurable. He made an ad|mini&s;tration, &s;o checkered and &s;peckled; he put together a piece of joinery, &s;o cro&s;sly indented and whim&s;ically dovetailed; a cabinet &s;o variou&s;ly inlaid; &s;uch a piece of diver&s;ified Mo&s;aic; &s;uch a te&s;&s;elated pavement without cement; here a bit of black &s;tone, and there a bit of white; patriots and courtiers, kings friends and republicans; whigs and tories; treacherous friends and open enemies: that it was indeed a very curious &s;how; but ut|terly un&s;afe to touch, and un&s;ure to &s;tand on. The colleagues whom he had a&s;&s;orted at the &s;ame boards, &s;tared at each other, and were obliged to a&s;k,

<P><PB N="321" REF="321">SIR, In con&s;equence of this arrangement, hav|ing put &s;o much the larger part of his enemies and oppo&s;ers into power, the confu&s;ion was &s;uch, that his own principles could not po&s;&s;ibly have any effect or influence in the conduct of affairs. If ever he fell into a fit of the gout, or if any other cau&s;e withdrew him from public cares, principles di|rectly the contrary were &s;ure to predominate.

<P>WHEN his face was hid but for a moment, his whole &s;y&s;tem was on a wide &s;ea, without chart or compa&s;s.

Deprived of his guiding influence, they were whirled about, the &s;port of every gu&s;t, and ea&s;ily driven into any port; and as tho&s;e who joined with them in manning the ve&s;&s;el were the mo&s;t directly oppo&s;ite to his opinions, mea&s;ures, and character, and far the mo&s;t artful and mo&s;t powerful of the &s;et, they ea&s;ily prevailed, &s;o as to &s;eize upon the vacant, unoccupied, and derelict minds of his friends; and in&s;tantly they turned the ve&s;&s;el wholly out of the cour&s;e of his po|licy. As if it were to in&s;ult as well as to betray him, even long before the clo&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of his admini&s;tration, when every thing was pub|licly tran&s;acted, and with great parade in his name, they made an act, declaring it highly ju&s;t and ex|pedient to rai&s;e a revenue in America.

<P>THIS light too is pa&s;&s;ed, and &s;et for ever.

In truth, &s;ir, he was the delight and ornament of this hou&s;e, and the charm of every private &s;ociety which he honoured with his pre&s;ence. Perhaps there never aro&s;e in this country, nor in any country, a man of a more pointed and fini&s;hed wit; and (where his pa&s;&s;ions were not concerned) of a more refined, exqui&s;ite, and penetrating a judgment. If he had not &s;o great a &s;tock, as &s;ome have had who flouri&s;hed formerly, of knowledge long trea&s;ured up, he knew better by far, than any man I ever was acquainted with, how to bring together within a &s;hort time, all that was nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h, to illu&s;trate, and to de|corate, that &s;ide of the que&s;tion he &s;upported. He &s;tated his matter &s;kilfully and powerfully. He particularly excelled in a mo&s;t luminous explanation, and di&s;play of his &s;ubject. His &s;tyle of argument was neither trite and vulgar, nor &s;ubtile and ab|&s;tru&s;e. He hit the hou&s;e ju&s;t between wind and water.&mdash;And not being troubled with too anxious a zeal for any matter in que&s;tion, he was never more tedious, or more earne&s;t, than the preconceived opinions and pre&s;ent temper of his hearers required; to whom he was always in perfect uni&s;on. He conformed exactly to the temper of the hou&s;e; and he &s;eemed to guide, becau&s;e he was always &s;ure to follow it.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="323">I BEG pardon, &s;ir, if, when I &s;peak of this and of other great men, I appear to digre&s;s in &s;aying &s;omething of their characters. In this eventful hi&s;tory of the revolutions of America, the characters of &s;uch men are of much importance. Great men are the guide-po&s;ts and land-marks in the &s;tate. The credit of &s;uch men at court, or in the nation, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of all the public mea&s;ures. It would be an invidious thing, (mo&s;t foreign I tru&s;t to what you think my di&s;po&s;ition) to remark the errors into which the authority of great names has brought the nation, without doing ju&s;tice at the &s;ame time to the great qualities, whence that autho|rity aro&s;e. The &s;ubject is in&s;tructive to tho&s;e who wi&s;h to form them&s;elves on whatever of excellence has gone before them. There are many young members in the hou&s;e (&s;uch of late has been the ra|pid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of public men) who never &s;aw that prodigy Charles Town&s;hend; nor of cour&s;e know what a ferment he was able to excite in every thing by the violent ebullition of his mixed virtues and failings. For failings he had undoubtedly&mdash;many of us remember them; we are this day con&s;idering the effect of them. But he had no failings which were not owing to a noble cau&s;e; to an ardent, generous, perhaps an immoderate pa&s;&s;ion for fame; a pa&s;&s;ion which is the in&s;tinct of all great &s;ouls. He wor&s;hipped that godde&s;s where&s;oever &s;he appeared; but he paid his particular devotions to her in her fa|vourite habitation, in her cho&s;en temple, the hou&s;e of commons. Be&s;ides the characters of the individuals that compo&s;e our body, it is impo&s;&s;ible, Mr. Speaker, not to ob&s;erve, that this hou&s;e has a col|lective character of its own. That character too, however imperfect, is not unamiable. Like all great public collections of men, you po&s;&s;e&s;s a marked love of virtue and an abhorrence of vice. But among vices, there is none, which the hou&s;e abhors
<PB N="324" REF="324">
in the &s;ame degree with <HI>ob&s;tinacy.</HI> Ob&s;tinacy, &s;ir, is certainly a great vice; and in the changeful &s;tate of political affairs it is frequently the cau&s;e of great mi&s;|chief. It happens, however, very unfortunately, that almo&s;t the whole line of the great and ma&s;cu|line virtues, con&s;tancy, gravity, magnanimity, for|titude, fidelity, and firmne&s;s, are clo&s;ely allied to this di&s;agreeable quality, of which you have &s;o ju&s;t an abhorrence: and in their exce&s;s, all the&s;e virtues very ea&s;ily fall into it. He, who paid &s;uch a punctilious attention to all your feelings, certainly took care not to &s;hock them by that vice which is the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tful to you.</P>
<P>THAT fear of di&s;plea&s;ing tho&s;e who ought mo&s;t to be plea&s;ed, betrayed him &s;ometimes into the other extreme. He had voted, and, in the year 1765, had been an advocate for the &s;tamp act. Things and the di&s;po&s;ition of mens minds were changed. In &s;hort the &s;tamp act began to be no favourite in this hou&s;e. He therefore attended at the private meeting, in which the re&s;olutions moved by a right hon. gentleman were &s;ettled; re&s;olutions leading to the repeal. The next day he voted for that repeal; and he would have &s;poken for it too, if an illne&s;s, (not as was then given out a political) but to my knowledge, a very real illne&s;s, had not prevented it.</P>
<P>THE very next &s;e&s;&s;ion, as the fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away, the repeal began to be in as bad an odour in this hou&s;e as the &s;tamp act had been in the &s;e&s;&s;ion before. To conform to the temper which began to prevail, and to prevail mo&s;t among&s;t tho&s;e mo&s;t in power, he declared, very early in the winter, that a revenue mu&s;t be had out of America. In&s;tantly he was tied down to his en|gagements by &s;ome, who had no objection to &s;uch experiments, when made at the co&s;t of per&s;ons for
<PB N="325" REF="325">
whom they had no particular regard. The whole body of courtiers drove him onward. They always talked as if the king &s;tood in a &s;ort of humiliated &s;tate, until &s;omething of the kind &s;hould be done.</P>
<P>HERE this extraordinary man, then chancellor of the exchequer, found him&s;elf in great &s;traits. To plea&s;e univer&s;ally, was the object of his life; but to tax and to plea&s;e, no more than to love and to be wi&s;e, is not given to men. However, he attempted it. To render the tax palatable to the partizans of American revenue, he made a preamble &s;tating the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a revenue. To clo&s;e with the American di&s;tinction, this revenue was <HI>external</HI> or port-duty; but again, to &s;often it to the other party, it was a duty of <HI>&s;upply.</HI> To gratify the <HI>coloni&s;ts,</HI> it was laid on Briti&s;h manufactures; to &s;a|tisfy the <HI>merchants of Britain,</HI> the duty was trivial, and (except that on tea, which touched only the devoted Ea&s;t India company) on none of the grand objects of commerce. To counterwork the Ame|rican contraband, the duty on tea was reduced from a &s;hilling to three-pence. But to &s;ecure the favour of tho&s;e who would tax America, the &s;cene of collection was changed, and, with the re&s;t, it was levied in the colonies. What need I &s;ay more? This fine-&s;pun &s;cheme had the u&s;ual fate of all ex|qui&s;ite policy. But the original plan of the duties, and the mode of executing that plan, both aro&s;e &s;ingly and &s;olely from a love of our applau&s;e. He was truly the child of the hou&s;e. He never thought, did, or &s;aid any thing but with a view to you. He every day adapted him&s;elf to your di&s;po&s;ition; and adju&s;ted him&s;elf before it, as at a looking-gla&s;s.</P>
<P>HE had ob&s;erved (indeed it could not e&s;cape him) that &s;everal per&s;ons, infinitely his inferiors in all re&s;pects, had formerly rendered them&s;elves con|&s;iderable

They were a race of men (I hope in God the &s;pecies is ex|tinct) who, when they ro&s;e in their place, no man living could divine, from any known adherence to parties, to opinions, or to principles; from any or|der or &s;y&s;tem in their politics; or from any &s;equel or connection in their ideas, what part they were going to take in any debate. It is a&s;toni&s;hing how much this uncertainty, e&s;pecially at critical times, called the attention of all parties on &s;uch men. All eyes were fixed on them, all ears open to hear them; each party gaped, and looked alternately for their vote, almo&s;t to the end of their &s;peeches. While the hou&s;e hung in this uncertainty, now the <HI>hear-hims</HI> ro&s;e from this &s;ide, now they re-bellowed from the other; and that party to whom they fell at length from their tremulous and dancing balance, always received them in a tempe&s;t of applau&s;e. The fortune of &s;uch men was a temptation too great to be re&s;i&s;ted by one, to whom, a &s;ingle whiff of incen&s;e withheld gave much greater pain, than he received delight, in the clouds of it, which daily ro&s;e about him from the prodigal &s;uper&s;tition of in|numerable admirers.

The principle of this di&s;claimer goes to what has been left, as well as what has been re|pealed. The tax which lingers after its compani|ons, (under a preamble declaring an American re|venue expedient, and for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of &s;up|porting the theory of that preamble) militates with the a&s;&s;urance authentically conveyed to the colo|nies; and is an exhau&s;tle&s;s &s;ource of jealou&s;y and animo&s;ity.

<P><PB N="330" REF="330">LET us, &s;ir, embrace &s;ome &s;y&s;tem or other before we end this &s;e&s;&s;ion. Do you mean to tax America, and to draw a productive revenue from thence? if you do, &s;peak out: name, fix, a&s;certain this reve|nue; &s;ettle its quantity; define its objects; provide for its collection; and then fight when you have &s;omething to fight for. If you murder&mdash;rob! If you kill, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and do not appear in the character of madmen, as well as a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, violent, vindictive, bloody, and tyrannical, without an object. But may better coun&s;els guide you!</P>
<P>AGAIN, and again, revert to your old principles&mdash;&s;eek peace, and en&s;ue it&mdash;leave America, if &s;he has taxable matter in her, to tax her&s;elf. I am not here going into the di&s;tinctions of rights, nor at|tempting to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into the&s;e metaphy&s;ical di&s;tinctions; I hate the very &s;ound of them. Leave the Americans as they anti|ently &s;tood; and the&s;e di&s;tinctions, born of our un|happy conte&s;t, will die along with it. They, and we, and their and our ance&s;tors, have been happy under that &s;y&s;tem. Let the memory of all actions, in contradiction to that good old mode, on both &s;ides, be extingui&s;hed for ever. Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it. Let this be your rea&s;on for binding their trade. Do not burthen them by taxes; you were not u&s;ed to do &s;o from the beginning. Let this be your rea&s;on for not taxing. The&s;e are the arguments of &s;tates and kingdoms. Leave the re&s;t to the &s;chools; for there only they may be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with &s;afety. But if, intemperately, unwi&s;ely, fatally, you &s;ophi&s;|ticate and poi&s;on the very &s;ource of government, by urging &s;ubtle deductions, and con&s;equences odious to tho&s;e you govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of &s;upreme &s;overeignty, you will teach them by the&s;e means to call that &s;overeignty
<PB N="331" REF="331">
it&s;elf in que&s;tion. When you drive him hard, the boar will &s;urely turn upon the hunters. If that &s;o|vereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will ca&s;t your &s;ove|reignty in your face. Nobody will be argued into &s;lavery. Sir, let the gentlemen on the other &s;ide call forth all their ability; let the be&s;t of them get up, and tell me, what one character of liberty the Americans have, and what one brand of &s;lavery they are free from, if they are bound in their pro|perty and indu&s;try, by all the re&s;traints you can imagine on commerce, and at the &s;ame time are made pack-hor&s;es of every tax you choo&s;e to im|po&s;e, without the lea&s;t &s;hare in granting them? When they bear the burthens of unlimited mono|poly, will you bring them to bear the burthens of unlimited revenue too? The Engli&s;hman in Ame|rica will feel that this is &s;lavery&mdash;that it is <HI>legal</HI> &s;la|very, will be no compen&s;ation, either to his feelings or his under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>A NOBLE Lord<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Lord Carmarthen.</NOTE>, who &s;poke &s;ome time ago, is full of the fire of ingenuous youth; and when he has modelled the ideas of a lively imagination by further experience, he will be an ornament to his country in either hou&s;e. He has &s;aid, that the Americans are our children; and how can they re|volt again&s;t their parent? He &s;ays, that if they are not free in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, England is not free; becau&s;e Manche&s;ter, and other con&s;iderable places, are not repre&s;ented. So then, becau&s;e &s;ome towns in England are not repre&s;ented, America is to have no repre&s;entative at all. They are <Q REND="inline">"our children;"</Q> but when children a&s;k for bread, we are not to give a &s;tone. Is it becau&s;e the natural re&s;i&s;tance of things, and the various mutations of time, hinders our government, or any &s;cheme of government, from being any more than a &s;ort of approximation
<PB N="332" REF="332">
to the right, is it therefore that the colonies are to recede from it infinitely? When this child of ours wi&s;hes to a&s;&s;imilate to its parent, and to reflect with a true filial re&s;emblance the beauteous countenance of Briti&s;h liberty; are we to turn to them the &s;hameful parts of our con&s;titution? are we to give them our weakne&s;s for their &s;trength; our oppro|brium for their glory; and the &s;lough of &s;lavery, which we are not able to work off, to &s;erve them for their freedom?</P>
<P>IF this be the ca&s;e, a&s;k your&s;elves this que&s;tion: will they be content in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;lavery? If not, look to the con&s;equences. Reflect how you are to govern a people, who think they ought to be free, and think they are not. Your &s;cheme yields no revenue; it yields nothing but di&s;content, di&s;|order, di&s;obedience; and &s;uch is the &s;tate of Ame|rica, that after wading up to your eyes in blood you could only end ju&s;t where you began; that is, to tax where no revenue is to be found, to&mdash;my voice fails me; my inclination indeed carries me no further&mdash;all is confu&s;ion beyond it.</P>
<P>WELL, &s;ir, I have recovered a little, and before I &s;it down I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;omething to another point with which gentlemen urge us. What is to be be|come of the declaratory act a&s;&s;erting the entirene&s;s of Briti&s;h legi&s;lative authority, if we abandon the practice of taxation?</P>
<P>FOR my part I look upon the rights &s;tated in that act, exactly in the manner in which I viewed them on its very fir&s;t propo&s;ition, and which I have often taken the liberty, with great humility, to lay before you. I look, I &s;ay, on the imperial rights of Great Britain, and the privileges which the coloni&s;ts ought to enjoy under the&s;e rights, to be ju&s;t the mo&s;t reconcilable things in the world.
<PB N="333" REF="333">
The parliament of Great Britain &s;its at the head of her exten&s;ive empire in two capacities; one as the local legi&s;lature of this i&s;land, providing for all things at home, immediately, and by no other in&s;tru|ment than the executive power.&mdash;The other, and I think her nobler capacity, is what I call her <HI>im|perial character</HI>; in which, as from the throne of heaven, &s;he &s;uperintends all the &s;everal inferior legi&s;latures, and guides, and controls them all without annihilating any. As all the&s;e provincial legi&s;latures are only co-ordinate to each other, they ought all to be &s;ubordinate to her; el&s;e they can neither pre&s;erve mutual peace, nor hope for mu|tual ju&s;tice, nor effectually afford mutual a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. It is nece&s;&s;ary to coerce the negligent, to re&s;train the violent, and to aid the weak and defi|cient, by the over-ruling plenitude of her power. She is never to intrude into the place of the others, whil&s;t they are equal to the common ends of their in&s;titution. But, in order to enable parliament to an&s;wer all the&s;e ends of provident and beneficent &s;uperintendance, her powers mu&s;t be boundle&s;s. The gentlemen who think the powers of parlia|ment limited, may plea&s;e them&s;elves to talk of requi&s;itions. But &s;uppo&s;e the requi&s;itions are not obeyed? What! &s;hall there be no re&s;erved power in the empire, to &s;upply a deficiency which may weaken, divide, and di&s;&s;ipate the whole? We are engaged in war&mdash;the &s;ecretary of &s;tate calls upon the colonies to contribute&mdash;&s;ome would do it, I think mo&s;t would chearfully furni&s;h whatever is demanded&mdash;one or two, &s;uppo&s;e, hang back, and, ea&s;ing them&s;elves, let the &s;tre&s;s of the draft lie on the others&mdash;&s;urely it is proper, that &s;ome authority might legally &s;ay&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tax your&s;elves for the com|mon &s;upply, or parliament will do it for you."</Q>
This backwardne&s;s was, as I am told, actually the ca&s;e of Penn&s;ylvania for &s;ome &s;hort time towards
<PB N="334" REF="334">
the beginning of the la&s;t war, owing to &s;ome inter|nal di&s;&s;entions in the colony. But, whether the fact were &s;o, or otherwi&s;e, the ca&s;e is equally to be provided for by a competent &s;overeign power. But then this ought to be no ordinary power; nor ever u&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. This is what I meant, when I have &s;aid at various times, that I con&s;ider the power of taxing in parliament as an in&s;trument of empire, and not as a means of &s;upply.</P>
<P>SUCH, &s;ir, is my idea of the con&s;titution of the Briti&s;h empire, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the con&s;titu|tion of Britain; and on the&s;e grounds I think &s;ub|ordination and liberty may be &s;ufficiently recon|ciled through the whole; whether to &s;erve a refin|ing &s;peculati&s;t, or a factious demagogue, I know not; but enough &s;urely for the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of man.</P>
<P>SIR, whil&s;t we held this happy cour&s;e, we drew more from the colonies than all the impotent vio|lence of de&s;poti&s;m ever could extort from them. We did this abundantly in the la&s;t war. It has never been once denied&mdash;and what rea&s;on have we to imagine that the colonies would not have pro|ceeded in &s;upplying government as liberally, if you had not &s;tepped in and hindered them from contributing, by interrupting the channel in which their liberality flowed with &s;o &s;trong a cour&s;e; by attempting to take, in&s;tead of being &s;atisfied to receive. Sir William Temple &s;ays, that Holland has loaded it&s;elf with ten times the impo&s;itions which it revolted from Spain rather than &s;ubmit to. He &s;ays true. Tyranny is a poor provider. It knows neither how to accumulate, nor how to extract.</P>
<P>I CHARGE therefore to this new and unfortunate &s;y&s;tem the lo&s;s not only of peace, of union, and of
<PB N="335" REF="335">
commerce, but even of revenue, which its friends are contending for.&mdash;It is morally certain, that we have lo&s;t at lea&s;t a million of free grants &s;ince the peace. I think we have lo&s;t a great deal more; and that tho&s;e who look for a revenue from the provinces, never could have pur&s;ued, even in that light, a cour&s;e more directly repugnant to their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>NOW, &s;ir, I tru&s;t I have &s;hewn, fir&s;t on that narrow ground which the hon. gentleman mea|&s;ured, that you are like to lo&s;e nothing by comply|ing with the motion, except what you have lo&s;t already. I have &s;hewn afterwards, that in time of peace you flouri&s;hed in commerce, and when war required it, had &s;ufficient aid from the colonies, while you pur&s;ued your antient policy; that you threw every thing into confu&s;ion when you made the &s;tamp-act; and that you re&s;tored every thing to peace and order when you repealed it. I have &s;hewn that the revival of the &s;y&s;tem of taxation has produced the very wor&s;t effects; and that the partial repeal has produced, not partial good, but univer&s;al evil. Let the&s;e con&s;iderations, founded on facts, not one of which can be denied, bring us back to your rea&s;on by the road of your expe|rience.</P>
<P>I CANNOT, as I have &s;aid, an&s;wer for mixed mea&s;ures; but &s;urely this mixture of lenity would give the whole a better chance of &s;ucce&s;s. When you once regain confidence, the way will be clear before you. Then you may enforce the act of navigation when it ought to be enforced. You will your&s;elves open it where it ought &s;till further to be opened. Proceed in what you do, whatever you do, from policy, and not from rancour. Let us act like men, let us act like &s;tate&s;men. Let us hold &s;ome &s;ort of con&s;i&s;tent conduct.&mdash;It is agreed
<PB N="336" REF="336">
that the revenue is not to be had in America. If we lo&s;e the profit, let us get rid of the odium.</P>
<P>ON this bu&s;ine&s;s of America I confe&s;s I am &s;eri|ous, even to &s;adne&s;s. I have had but one opinion concerning it &s;ince I &s;at, and before I &s;at, in par|liament. The noble lord<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> will, as u&s;ual, proba|bly, attribute the part taken by me and my friends in this bu&s;ine&s;s, to a de&s;ire of getting his places. Let him enjoy this happy and original idea. If I deprived him of it, I &s;hould take away mo&s;t of his wit, and all his argument. But I had rather bear the brunt of all his wit, and indeed blows much heavier, than &s;tand an&s;werable to God for embrac|ing a &s;y&s;tem that tends to the de&s;truction of &s;ome of the very be&s;t and faire&s;t of his works. But I know the map of England, as well as the noble lord,<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> or as any other per&s;on; and I know that the way I take is not the road to preferment. My excellent and honourable friend under me on the floor<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Mr. Dowde&s;well.</NOTE> has trod that road with great toil for up|wards of twenty years together. He is not yet arrived at the noble lord's de&s;tination. However, the tracks of my worthy friend are tho&s;e I have ever wi&s;hed to follow; becau&s;e I know they lead to honour. Long may we tread the &s;ame road together: whoever may accompany us, or who|ever may laugh at us on our journey! I hone&s;tly and &s;olemnly declare, I have in all &s;ea&s;ons adhered to the &s;y&s;tem of 1766, for no other rea&s;on, than that I think it laid deep in your true&s;t intere&s;ts&mdash;and that, by limiting the exerci&s;e, it fixes on the firme&s;t foundations a real, con&s;i&s;tent, well-ground|ed authority in parliament. Until you come back to that &s;y&s;tem, there will be no peace for England.</P>

<HEAD>EDITOR'S ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>WE believe there is no need of an apo|logy to the public for offering to them any genuine &s;peeches of Mr. Burke's. The ge|neral approbation they met with from all parties at Bri&s;tol, per&s;uades us that a good edition of them will not be unacceptable; which we own to be the inducement, and we hope is a ju&s;tification, of our offering it.</P>
<P>WE do not pre&s;ume to de&s;cant on the merit of the&s;e &s;peeches; but as it is no le&s;s new, than honourable, to find a popular candidate, at a popular election, daring to avow his di&s;&s;ent to certain points that have been con&s;idered as very popular objects, and maintaining him&s;elf on the manly confidence of his own opinion; &s;o, we mu&s;t &s;ay, that it does great credit to the people of England, as it proves to the world, that, to in&s;ure their confidence, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to flatter them, or to affect a &s;ub&s;erviency to their pa&s;&s;ions or their prejudices.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, that at the opening of the poll the candidates were lord Clare, Mr. Brickdale, the two la&s;t mem|bers; and Mr. Cruger, a con&s;iderable mer|chant at Bri&s;tol. On the &s;econd day of the poll lord Clare declined; and a con&s;ider|able

body of gentlemen, who had wi&s;hed that the city of Bri&s;tol &s;hould, at this critical &s;ea&s;on, be repre&s;ented by &s;ome gentleman of tried abilities and known commercial know|ledge, immediately put Mr. Burke in no|mination. Some of them &s;et off expre&s;s for London, to appri&s;e that gentleman of this event; but he was gone to Malton in York|&s;hire. The &s;pirit and active zeal of the&s;e gentlemen followed him to Malton. They arrived there ju&s;t after Mr. Burke's election for that place, and invited him to Bri&s;tol.</P>
<P>MR. Burke, as he tells us in his fir&s;t &s;peech, acquainted his con&s;tituents with the honourable offer that was made him: and, with their con&s;ent, he immediately &s;et off for Bri&s;tol on the Tue&s;day at &s;ix in the even|ing; he arrived at Bri&s;tol at half pa&s;t two in the afternoon on Thur&s;day the 13th of Octo|ber, being the &s;ixth day of the poll.</P>
<P>HE drove directly to the mayor's hou&s;e, who not being at home, he proceeded to the Guildhall, where he a&s;cended the hu&s;tings, and having &s;aluted the electors, the &s;heriffs, and the two candidates, he repo&s;ed him&s;elf for a few minutes, and then addre&s;&s;ed the electors in a &s;peech which was received with great and univer&s;al applau&s;e and appro|bation.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM come hither to &s;olicit in per&s;on, that fa|vour which my friends have hitherto endeavoured to procure for me, by the mo&s;t obliging, and to me the mo&s;t honourable, exertions.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;o high an opinion of the great tru&s;t which you have to confer on this occa&s;ion; and, by long experience, &s;o ju&s;t a diffidence in my abilities, to fill it in a manner adequate even to my own ideas, that I &s;hould never have ventured of my&s;elf to intrude into that awful &s;ituation. But &s;ince I am called upon by the de&s;ire of &s;everal re|&s;pectable fellow-&s;ubjects, as I have done at other times, I give up my fears to their wi&s;hes. What|ever my other deficiencies may be, I do not know what it is to be wanting to my friends.</P>
<P>I AM not fond of attempting to rai&s;e public ex|pectation by great promi&s;es. At this time, there is much cau&s;e to con&s;ider, and very little to pre|&s;ume. We &s;eem to be approaching to a great cri&s;is in our affairs, which calls for the whole wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e&s;t among us, without being able to a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that any wi&s;dom can pre&s;erve us from many and great inconveniencies. You know I
<PB N="342" REF="341">
&s;peak of our unhappy conte&s;t with America. I confe&s;s, it is a matter on which I look down as from a precipice. It is difficult in it&s;elf, and it is rendered more intricate by a great variety of plans of conduct. I do not mean to enter into them. I will not &s;u&s;pect a want of good intention in fram|ing them. But however pure the intentions of their authors may have been, we all know that the event has been unfortunate. The means of recovering our affairs are not obvious. So many great que&s;tions of commerce, of finance, of con&s;titution, and of policy, are involved in this American deliberation, that I dare engage for nothing, but that I &s;hall give it, without any predilection to former opinions, or any &s;ini&s;ter bias what&s;oever, the mo&s;t hone&s;t and impartial con&s;ideration of which I am capable. The public has a full right to it; and this great city, a main pillar in the commercial intere&s;t of Great Britain, mu&s;t totter on its ba&s;e by the &s;lighte&s;t mi&s;|take with regard to our American mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THUS much, however, I think it not ami&s;s to lay before you; That I am not, I hope, apt to take up or lay down my opinions lightly. I have held, and ever &s;hall maintain, to the be&s;t of my power, unimpaired and undimini&s;hed, the ju&s;t, wi&s;e, and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;titutional &s;uperiority of Great-Britain. This is nece&s;&s;ary for America, as well as for us. I never mean to depart from it. Whatever may be lo&s;t by it, I avow it. The forfeiture even of your favour, if by &s;uch a declaration I could forfeit it, though the fir&s;t object of my ambition never will make me di&s;gui&s;e my &s;entiments on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>BUT&mdash;I have ever had a clear opinion, and have ever held a con&s;tant corre&s;pondent conduct, that this &s;uperiority is con&s;i&s;tent with all the liber|ties a &s;ober and &s;pirited American ought to de&s;ire. I never mean to put any coloni&s;t, or any human
<PB N="343" REF="342">
creature, in a &s;ituation, not becoming a free-man. To reconcile Briti&s;h &s;uperiority with American li|berty &s;hall be my great object, as far as my little faculties extend. I am far from thinking that both, even yet, may not be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>WHEN I fir&s;t devoted my&s;elf to the public &s;er|vice, I con&s;idered how I &s;hould render my&s;elf fit for it; and this I did by endeavouring to di&s;cover what it was, that gave this country the rank it holds in the world. I found that our pro&s;perity and dig|nity aro&s;e principally, if not &s;olely, from two &s;ources; our con&s;titution and commerce. Both the&s;e I have &s;pared no &s;tudy to under&s;tand, and no endeavour to &s;upport.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tingui&s;hing part of our con&s;titution is its liberty. To pre&s;erve that liberty inviolate, &s;eems the particular duty and proper tru&s;t of a member of the hou&s;e of commons. But the liberty, the only liberty I mean, is a liberty connected with order; that not only exi&s;ts along with order and virtue, but which cannot exi&s;t at all without them. It inheres in good and &s;teady government, as in its &s;ub&s;tance and vital principle.</P>
<P>THE other &s;ource of our power is commerce, of which you are &s;o large a part, and which cannot exi&s;t, no more than your liberty, without a con|nection with many virtues. It has ever been a very particular and a very favourite object of my &s;tudy, in its principles, and in its details. I think many here are acquainted with the truth of what I &s;ay. This I know, that I have ever had my hou&s;e open, and my poor &s;ervices ready, for traders and manu|facturers of every denomination. My favourite ambition is to have tho&s;e &s;ervices acknowledged. I now appear before you to make trial, whether my earne&s;t endeavours have been &s;o wholly oppre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="344" REF="343">
by the weakne&s;s of my abilities, as to be rendered in&s;ignificant in the eyes of a great trading city; or whether you chu&s;e to give a weight to humble abi|lities, for the &s;ake of the hone&s;t exertions with which they are accompanied. This is my trial to|day. My indu&s;try is not on trial. Of my indu&s;try I am &s;ure, as far as my con&s;titution of mind and body admitted.</P>
<P>WHEN I was invited by many re&s;pectable mer|chants, freeholders, and freemen of this city, to offer them my &s;ervices, I had ju&s;t received the ho|nour of an election at another place, at a very great di&s;tance from this. I immediately opened the matter to tho&s;e of my worthy con&s;tituents who were with me, and they unanimou&s;ly advi&s;ed me not to decline it. They told me, that they had elected me with a view to the public &s;ervice; and as great que&s;tions relative to our commerce and colonies were imminent, that in &s;uch matters I might derive authority and &s;upport from the repre&s;entation of this great commercial city; they de&s;ired me therefore to &s;et off without delay, very well per&s;uaded that I never could forget my obligations to them, or to my friends, for the choice they had made of me. From that time to this in&s;tant I have not &s;lept; and if I &s;hould have the honour of being freely cho&s;en by you, I hope I &s;hall be as far from &s;lumbering or &s;leeping when your &s;ervice requires me to be awake, as I have been in coming to offer my&s;elf a candi|date for your favour.</P>

If he, who was bred and pa&s;&s;ed his whole life among&s;t you; if he, who, through the ea&s;y gradations of acquaint|ance, friend&s;hip, and e&s;teem, has obtained the ho|nour, which &s;eems of it&s;elf, naturally and almo&s;t in|&s;en&s;ibly, to meet with tho&s;e, who, by the even te|nour of plea&s;ing manners and &s;ocial virtues, &s;lide into the love and confidence of their fellow-citi|zens;&mdash;if he cannot &s;peak but with great emotion on this &s;ubject, &s;urrounded as he is on all &s;ides with his old friends; you will have the goodne&s;s to ex|cu&s;e me, if my real, unaffected embarra&s;&s;ment prevents me from expre&s;&s;ing my gratitude to you as I ought.</P>
<P>I WAS brought hither under the di&s;advantage of being unknown, even by &s;ight, to any of you. No previous canva&s;s was made for me, I was put in nomination after the poll was opened. I did not appear until it was far advanced. If, under all the&s;e accumulated di&s;advantages, your good opi|nion has carried me to this happy point of &s;ucce&s;s; you will pardon me, if I can only &s;ay to you col|lectively, as I &s;aid to you individually, &s;imply and
<PB N="348" REF="346">
plainly, I thank you&mdash;I am obliged to you&mdash;I am not in&s;en&s;ible of your kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS is all that I am able to &s;ay for the ine&s;tima|ble favour you have conferred upon me. But I cannot be &s;atisfied, without &s;aying a little more in defence of the right you have to confer &s;uch a fa|vour. The per&s;on that appeared here as coun&s;el for the candidate, who &s;o long and &s;o earne&s;tly &s;oli|cited your votes, thinks proper to deny, that a very great part of you have any votes to give. He fixes a &s;tandard period of time in his own imagination, not what the law defines, but merely what the con|venience of his client &s;ugge&s;ts, by which he would cut off, at one &s;troke, all tho&s;e freedoms, which are the deare&s;t privileges of your corporation; which the common law authorizes; which your magi|&s;trates are compelled to grant; which come duly authenticated into this court; and are &s;aved in the cleare&s;t words, and with the mo&s;t religious care and tenderne&s;s, in that very act of parliament, which was made to regulate the elections by freemen, and to prevent all po&s;&s;ible abu&s;es in making them.</P>
<P>I DO not intend to argue the matter here. My learned coun&s;el has &s;upported your cau&s;e with his u&s;ual ability; the worthy &s;heriffs have acted with their u&s;ual equity, and I have no doubt, that the &s;ame equity, which dictates the return, will guide the final determination. I had the honour, in con|junction with many far wi&s;er men, to contribute a very &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but however &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to the forming the judicature which is to try &s;uch que&s;tions. It would be unnatural in me, to doubt the ju&s;tice of that court, in the trial of my own cau&s;e, to which I have been &s;o active to give juri&s;|diction over every other.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="347">I ASSURE the worthy freemen, and this corpora|tion, that, if the gentleman per&s;everes in the inten|tions, which his pre&s;ent warmth dictates to him, I will attend their cau&s;e with diligence, and I hope with effect. For, if I know any thing of my&s;elf, it is not my own intere&s;t in it, but my full conviction, that induces me to tell you&mdash;<HI>I think there is not a &s;hadow of doubt in the ca&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I DO not imagine that you find me ra&s;h in de|claring my&s;elf, or very forward in troubling you. From the beginning to the end of the election, I have kept &s;ilence in all matters of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I have never a&s;ked a que&s;tion of a voter on the other &s;ide, or &s;upported a doubtful vote on my own. I re&s;pected the abilities of my managers; I relied on the candour of the court. I think the worthy &s;he|riffs will bear me witne&s;s, that I have never once made an attempt to impo&s;e upon their rea&s;on, to &s;urprize their ju&s;tice, or to ruffle their temper. I &s;tood on the hu&s;tings (except when I gave my thanks to tho&s;e who favoured me with their votes) le&s;s like a candidate, than an unconcerned &s;pectator of a public proceeding. But here the face of things is altered. Here is an attempt for a general <HI>ma&s;&s;a|cre</HI> of &s;uffrages; an attempt, by a promi&s;cuous carnage of <HI>friends</HI> and <HI>foes,</HI> to exterminate above two thou&s;and votes, including <HI>&s;even hundred polled for the gentleman him&s;elf, who now complains,</HI> and who would de&s;troy the friends whom he has obtained, only becau&s;e he cannot obtain as many of them as he wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>HOW he will be permitted, in another place, to &s;tultify and di&s;able him&s;elf, and to plead again&s;t his own acts, is another que&s;tion. The law will decide it. I &s;hall only &s;peak of it as it concerns the pro|priety of public conduct in this city. I do not pre|tend to lay down rules of decorum for other gen|tlemen.
<PB N="350" REF="348">
They are be&s;t judges of the mode of proceeding that will recommend them to the favour of their fellow-citizens. But I confe&s;s, I &s;hould look rather aukward, if I had been the <HI>very fir&s;t to produce the new copies of freedom,</HI> if I had per&s;i&s;ted in producing them to the la&s;t; if I had ran&s;acked, with the mo&s;t unremitting indu&s;try, and the mo&s;t penetrating re&s;earch, the remote&s;t corners of the kingdom to di&s;cover them; if I were then, all at once, to turn &s;hort, and declare, that I had been &s;porting all this while with the right of election: and that I had been drawing out a poll, upon no &s;ort of rational grounds, which di&s;turbed the peace of my fellow-citizens for a month together&mdash;I really, for my part, &s;hould appear aukward under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>IT would be &s;till more aukward in me, if I were gravely to look the &s;heriffs in the face, and to tell them, they were not to determine my cau&s;e on my own principles; nor to make the return upon tho&s;e votes, upon which I had re&s;ted my election. Such would be my appearance to the court and magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>BUT how &s;hould I appear to the <HI>Voters</HI> them|&s;elves? If I had gone round to the citizens intitled to freedom, and &s;queezed them by the hand&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir, I humbly beg your vote&mdash;I &s;hall be eternally thankful&mdash;may I hope for the honour of your &s;upport?&mdash;Well!&mdash;come&mdash;we &s;hall &s;ee you at the council-hou&s;e."</Q>
&mdash;If I were then to deliver them to my managers, pack them into tallies, vote them off in court, and when I heard from the bar&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Such a one only! and &s;uch a one for ever!&mdash;he's my man!"&mdash;"Thank you, good &s;ir&mdash;Hah! my worthy friend! thank you kindly&mdash;that's an hone&s;t fellow&mdash;how is your good family?"</Q>
&mdash;Whil&s;t the&s;e words were
<PB N="351" REF="349">
hardly out of my mouth, if I &s;hould have wheeled round at once, and told them&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Get you gone, you pack of worthle&s;s fellows! you have no votes&mdash;you are u&s;urpers! you are intruders on the rights of real freemen! I will have nothing to do with you! you ought never to have been produced at this election, and the &s;heriffs ought not to have admitted you to poll."</Q></P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, I &s;hould make a &s;trange figure, if my conduct had been of this &s;ort. I am not &s;o old an acquaintance of yours as the worthy gentle|man. Indeed I could not have ventured on &s;uch kind of freedoms with you. But I am bound, and I will endeavour, to have ju&s;tice done to the rights of freemen; even though I &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, be obliged to vindicate the former <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Brickdale opened his poll, it &s;eems, with a tally of tho&s;e very kind of freemen, and voted many hundreds of them.</NOTE> part of my antagoni&s;t's conduct again&s;t his own pre&s;ent inclinations.</P>
<P>I OWE my&s;elf, in all things, to <HI>all</HI> the freemen of this city. My particular friends have a demand on me, that I &s;hould not deceive their expectati|ons. Never was cau&s;e or man &s;upported with more con&s;tancy, more activity, more &s;pirit. I have been &s;upported with a zeal indeed and hearti|ne&s;s in my friends, which (if their object had been at all proportioned to their endeavours) could never be &s;ufficiently commended. They &s;upported me upon the mo&s;t liberal principles. They wi&s;hed that the members for Bri&s;tol &s;hould be cho&s;en for the city, and for their country at large, and not for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>SO far they are not di&s;appointed. If I po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing el&s;e, I am &s;ure I po&s;&s;e&s;s the temper that is
<PB N="352" REF="350">
fit for your &s;ervice. I know nothing of Bri&s;tol, but by the favours I have received, and the virtues I have &s;een exerted in it.</P>
<P>I SHALL ever retain, what I now feel, the mo&s;t perfect and grateful attachment to my friends&mdash;and I have no enmities; no re&s;entment. I never can con&s;ider fidelity to engagements, and con|&s;tancy in friend&s;hips, but with the highe&s;t appro|bation; even when tho&s;e noble qualities are em|ployed again&s;t my own preten&s;ions. The gentle|man, who is not fortunate as I have been in this conte&s;t, enjoys, in this re&s;pect, a con&s;olation full of honour both to him&s;elf and to his friends. They have certainly left nothing undone for his &s;ervice.</P>
<P>AS for the trifling petulance, which the rage of party &s;tirs up in little minds, though it &s;hould &s;hew it&s;elf even in this court, it has not made the &s;light|e&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on me. The highe&s;t flight of &s;uch clamorous birds is winged in an inferior region of the air. We hear them, and we look upon them, ju&s;t as you, gentlemen, when you enjoy the &s;erene air on your lofty rocks, look down upon the gulls, that &s;kim the mud of your river, when it is ex|hau&s;ted of its tide.</P>
<P>I AM &s;orry I cannot conclude, without &s;aying a word on a topic touched upon by my worthy col|league. I wi&s;h that topic had been pa&s;&s;ed by; at a time when I have &s;o little lei&s;ure to di&s;cu&s;s it. But &s;ince he has thought proper to throw it out, I owe you a clear explanation of my poor &s;entiments on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>HE tells you, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the topic of in&s;tructions has occa&s;ioned much altercation and unea&s;ine&s;s in this city;"</Q>
and he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf (if I un|der&s;tand him rightly) in favour of the coercive au|thority of &s;uch in&s;tructions.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="351">CERTAINLY, gentlemen, it ought to be the happine&s;s and glory of a repre&s;entative, to live in the &s;tricte&s;t union, the clo&s;e&s;t corre&s;pondence, and the mo&s;t unre&s;erved communication with his con|&s;tituents. Their wi&s;hes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion high re&s;pect; their bu&s;i|ne&s;s unremitted attention. It is his duty to &s;acri|fice his repo&s;e, his plea&s;ures, his &s;atisfactions, to theirs; and, above all, ever, and in all ca&s;es, to prefer their intere&s;t to his own. But, his unbia&s;&s;ed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened con&s;cience, he ought not to &s;acrifice to you; to any man, or to any &s;et of men living. The&s;e he does not derive from your plea&s;ure; no, nor from the law and the con&s;titution. They are a tru&s;t from Providence, for the abu&s;e of which he is deeply an&s;werable. Your repre&s;entative owes you, not his indu&s;try only, but his judgment; and he betrays, in&s;tead of &s;erving you, if he &s;acrifices it to your opinion.</P>
<P>MY worthy colleague &s;ays, his will ought to be &s;ub&s;ervient to yours. If that be all, the thing is innocent. If government were a matter of will upon any &s;ide, yours, without que&s;tion, ought to be &s;uperior. But government and legi&s;lation are matters of rea&s;on and judgment, and not of in|clination; and, what &s;ort of rea&s;on is that, in which the determination precedes the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; in which one &s;et of men deliberate, and another de|cide; and where tho&s;e who form the conclu&s;ion are perhaps three hundred miles di&s;tant from tho&s;e who hear the arguments?</P>
<P>TO deliver an opinion, is the right of all men; that of con&s;tituents is a weighty and re&s;pectable opinion, which a repre&s;entative ought always to rejoice to hear; and which he ought always mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider. But <HI>authoritative</HI> in&s;tructions;
<PB N="354" REF="352">
<HI>mandates</HI> i&s;&s;ued, which the member is bound blindly and implicitly to obey, to vote, and to argue for, though contrary to the cleare&s;t conviction of his judgment and con&s;cience; the&s;e are things utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which ari&s;e from a fundamental mi&s;take of the whole order and tenour of our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>PARLIAMENT is not a <HI>congre&s;s</HI> of amba&s;&s;adors from different and ho&s;tile intere&s;ts; which intere&s;ts each mu&s;t maintain, as an agent and advocate, again&s;t other agents and advocates; but parliament is a <HI>deliberative</HI> a&s;&s;embly of <HI>one</HI> nation, with <HI>one</HI> intere&s;t, that of the whole; where, not local pur|po&s;es, not local prejudices ought to guide, but the general good, re&s;ulting from the general rea&s;on of the whole. You chu&s;e a member indeed; but when you have cho&s;en him, he is not member of Bri&s;tol, but he is a member of <HI>parliament.</HI> If the local con&s;tituent &s;hould have an intere&s;t, or &s;hould form an ha&s;ty opinion, evidently oppo&s;ite to the real good of the re&s;t of the community, the mem|ber for that place ought to be as far, as any other, from any endeavour to give it effect. I beg par|don for &s;aving &s;o much on this &s;ubject. I have been unwillingly drawn into it; but I &s;hall ever u&s;e a re&s;pectful frankne&s;s of communication with you. Your faithful friend, your devoted &s;ervant, I &s;hall be to the end of my life: a flatterer you do not wi&s;h for. On this point of in&s;tructions, however, I think it &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible, we ever can have any &s;ort of difference. Perhaps I may give you too much, rather than too little trouble.</P>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t hour I was encouraged to court your favour to this happy day of obtaining it, I have never promi&s;ed you any thing, but humble and per&s;evering endeavours to do my duty. The weight of that duty, I confe&s;s, makes me tremble, and whoever well con&s;iders what it is, of all things
<PB N="355" REF="353">
in the world will fly from what has the lea&s;t like|ne&s;s to a po&s;itive and precipitate engagement. To be a good member of parliament, is, let me tell you, no ea&s;y ta&s;k; e&s;pecially at this time, when there is &s;o &s;trong a di&s;po&s;ition to run into the pe|rilous extremes of &s;ervile compliance, or wild po|pularity. To unite circum&s;pection with vigour, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; but it is extremely difficult. We are now members for a rich commercial <HI>city</HI>; this city, however, is but a part of a rich com|mercial <HI>nation,</HI> the intere&s;ts of which are various, multiform, and intricate. We are members for that great <HI>nation,</HI> which however is it&s;elf but part of a great <HI>empire,</HI> extended by our virtue and our fortune to the farthe&s;t limits of the ea&s;t and of the we&s;t. All the&s;e wide-&s;pread intere&s;ts mu&s;t be con|&s;idered; mu&s;t be compared; mu&s;t be reconciled if po&s;&s;ible. We are members for a <HI>free</HI> country; and &s;urely we all know, that the machine of a free con&s;titution is no &s;imple thing; but as intricate and as delicate, as it is valuable. We are mem|bers in a great and ancient <HI>monarchy</HI>; and we mu&s;t pre&s;erve religiou&s;ly, the true legal rights of the &s;overeign, which form the key-&s;tone that binds together the noble and well-con&s;tructed arch of our empire and our con&s;titution. A con&s;titution made up of balanced powers mu&s;t ever be a critical thing. As &s;uch I mean to touch that part of it which comes within my reach. I know my inabi|lity, and I wi&s;h for &s;upport from every quarter. In particular I &s;hall aim at the friend&s;hip, and &s;hall cultivate the be&s;t corre&s;pondence, of the worthy colleague you have given me.</P>
<P>I TROUBLE you no farther than once more to thank you all; you, gentlemen, for your favours; the candidates for their temperate and polite beha|viour; and the &s;heriffs, for a conduct which may give a model for all who are in public &s;tations.</P>

<HEAD>SPEECH FOR A CONCILIATION WITH THE COLONIES.</HEAD>
<P>I HOPE, &s;ir, that, notwith&s;tanding the au&s;terity of the chair, your good-nature will incline you to &s;ome degree of indulgence towards human frailty. You will not think it unnatural, that tho&s;e who have an object depending, which &s;trongly engages their hopes and fears, &s;hould be &s;omewhat inclined to &s;uper&s;tition. As I came into the hou&s;e full of anx|iety about the event of my motion, I found to my infinite &s;urprize, that the grand penal bill, by which we had pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence on the trade and &s;u&s;tenance of America, is to be returned to us from the other hou&s;e<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The act to re&s;train the trade and commerce of the pro|vinces of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay and New Hamp&s;hire, and colo|nies of Connecticut and Rhode I&s;land, and Providence Plantation, in North America, to Great Britain, Ireland, and the Briti&s;h I&s;lands in the We&s;t Indies; and to prohibit &s;uch provinces and colonies from carrying on any fi&s;hery on the banks of Newfoundland, and other places therein men|tioned, under certain conditions and limitations."</Q></P></NOTE>. I do confe&s;s, I could not help looking on this event as a fortunate omen. I look upon it as a &s;ort of providential favour; by which we are put once more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our deliberative capacity, upon a bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o very que&s;tionable in its nature, &s;o very uncertain in its i&s;&s;ue. By the return of this bill, which &s;eemed to have taken its flight for ever,
<PB N="360" REF="356">
we are at this very in&s;tant nearly as free to chu&s;e a plan for our American government, as we were on the fir&s;t day of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. If, &s;ir, we incline to the &s;ide of conciliation, we are not at all embar|ra&s;&s;ed (unle&s;s we plea&s;e to make our&s;elves &s;o) by any incongruous mixture of coercion and re&s;traint. We are therefore called upon, as it were by a &s;uperior warning voice, again to attend to America; to at|tend to the whole of it together; and to review the &s;ubject with an unu&s;ual degree of care and calm|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>SURELY it is an awful &s;ubject; or there is none &s;o on this &s;ide of the grave. When I fir&s;t had the honour of a &s;eat in this hou&s;e, the affairs of that con|tinent pre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves upon us, as the mo&s;t im|portant and mo&s;t delicate object of parliamentary attention. My little &s;hare in this great deliberation oppre&s;&s;ed me. I found my&s;elf a partaker in a very high tru&s;t; and having no &s;ort of rea&s;on to rely on the &s;trength of my natural abilities for the proper execution of that tru&s;t, I was obliged to take more than common pains, to in&s;truct my&s;elf in every thing which relates to our colonies. I was not le&s;s under the nece&s;&s;ity of forming &s;ome fixed ideas, concerning the general policy of the Briti&s;h Empire. Something of this &s;ort &s;eemed to be indi&s;pen&s;able; in order, amid&s;t &s;o va&s;t a fluctuation of pa&s;&s;ions and opinions, to concenter my thoughts; to balla&s;t my conduct; to pre&s;erve me from being blown about by every wind of fa&s;hionable doctrine. I really did not think it &s;afe, or manly, to have fre&s;h principles to &s;eek upon every fre&s;h mail which &s;hould arive from America.</P>
<P>AT that period, I had the fortune to find my&s;elf in perfect concurrence with a large majority in this hou&s;e. Bowing under that high authority, and penetrated with the &s;harpne&s;s and &s;trength of that
<PB N="361" REF="357">
early impre&s;&s;ion, I have continued ever &s;ince, with|out the lea&s;t deviation, in my original &s;entiments. Whether this be owing to an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in error, or to a religious adherence to what ap|pears to me truth and rea&s;on, it is in your equity to judge.</P>
<P>SIR, parliament having an enlarged view of ob|jects, made, during this interval, more frequent changes in their &s;entiments and their conduct, than could be ju&s;tified in a particular per&s;on upon the contracted &s;cale of private information. But though I do not hazard any thing approaching to a cen&s;ure on the motives of former parliaments to all tho&s;e al|terations, one fact is undoubted; that under them the &s;tate of America has been kept in continual agi|tation. Every thing admini&s;tered as remedy to the public complaint, if it did not produce, was at lea&s;t followed by, an heightening of the di&s;temper; until, by a variety of experiments, that important country has been brought into her pre&s;ent &s;ituation;&mdash;a &s;ituation, which I will not mi&s;call, which I dare not name; which I &s;carcely know how to comprehend in the terms of any de&s;cription.</P>
<P>IN this po&s;ture, &s;ir, things &s;tood at the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion. About that time a worthy member<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr Ro&s;e Fuller.</NOTE> of great parliamentary experience, who in the year 1766, filled the chair of the American committee with much ability, took me a&s;ide; and, lamenting the pre&s;ent a&s;pect of our politics, told me, things were come to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that our former methods of proceeding in the hou&s;e would be no longer to|lerated. That the public tribunal (never too indul|gent to a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful oppo&s;ition) would now &s;crutinize our conduct with unu&s;ual &s;everity. That the very vici&s;&s;itudes and &s;hiftings of mini&s;|terial
<PB N="362" REF="358">
mea&s;ures, in&s;tead of convicting their authors of incon&s;tancy and want of &s;y&s;tem, would be taken as an occa&s;ion of charging us with a predetermined di&s;content, which nothing could &s;atisfy; whil&s;t we accu&s;ed every mea&s;ure of vigour as cruel, and every propo&s;al of lenity as weak and irre&s;olute. The pub|lic, he &s;aid, would not have patience to &s;ee us play the game out with our adver&s;aries: we mu&s;t pro|duce our hand. It would be expected, that tho&s;e who for many years had been active in &s;uch affairs &s;hould &s;hew, that they had formed &s;ome clear and decided idea of the principles of colony government; and were capable of drawing out &s;omething like a platform of the ground, which might be laid for future and permanent tranquillity.</P>
<P>I FELT the truth of what my hon. friend repre|&s;ented: but I felt my &s;ituation too. His application might have been made with far greater propriety to many other gentlemen. No man was indeed ever better di&s;po&s;ed, or wor&s;e qualified, for &s;uch an undertaking than my&s;elf. Though I gave &s;o far into his opinion, that I immediately threw my thoughts into a &s;ort of parliamentary form, I was by no means equally ready to produce them. It ge|nerally argues &s;ome degree of natural impotence of mind, or &s;ome want of knowledge of the world, to hazard plans of government, except from a &s;eat of authority. Propo&s;itions are made, not only ineffectually, but &s;omewhat di&s;reputably, when the minds of men are not properly di&s;po&s;ed for their reception; and for my part, I am not am|bitious of ridicule; not ab&s;olutely a candidate for di&s;grace.</P>
<P>BESIDES, &s;ir, to &s;peak the plain truth, I have in general no very exalted opinion of the virtue of pa|per government; nor of any politics, in which the plan is to be wholly &s;eparated from the execution.
<PB N="363" REF="359">
But when I &s;aw, that anger and violence prevailed every day more and more; and that things were ha&s;tening towards an incurable alienation of our colonies; I confe&s;s, my caution gave way. I felt this, as one of tho&s;e few moments in which deco|rum yields to an higher duty. Public calamity is a mighty leveller; and there are occa&s;ions when any, even the &s;lighte&s;t, chance of doing good, mu&s;t be laid hold on, even by the mo&s;t incon&s;ider|able per&s;on.</P>
<P>TO re&s;tore order and repo&s;e to an empire &s;o great and &s;o di&s;tracted as ours, is, merely in the attempt, an undertaking that would ennoble the flights of the highe&s;t genius, and obtain pardon for the efforts of the meane&s;t under&s;tanding. Strug|gling a good while with the&s;e thoughts, by degrees I felt my&s;elf more firm. I derived, at length, &s;ome confidence from what in other circum&s;tances u&s;ually produces timidity. I grew le&s;s anxious, even from the idea of my own in&s;ignificance. For, judging of what you are, by what you ought to be, I per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that you would not reject a rea&s;onable propo&s;ition, becau&s;e it had nothing but its rea&s;on to recommend it. On the other hand, being totally de&s;titute of all &s;hadow of influence, natural or adventitious, I was very &s;ure, that, if my propo&s;ition were futile or dangerous; if it were weakly conceived, or improperly timed, there was nothing exterior to it, of power to awe, dazzle, or delude you. You will &s;ee it ju&s;t as it is; and you will treat it ju&s;t as it de&s;erves.</P>
<P>THE propo&s;ition is peace. Not peace through the medium of war; not peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate and endle&s;s ne|gociations; not peace to ari&s;e out of univer&s;al di&s;|cord, fomented, from principle, in all parts of the empire; not peace to depend on the juridical de|termination
<PB N="364" REF="360">
of perplexing que&s;tions; or the preci&s;e marking the &s;hadowy boundaries of a complex go|vernment. It is &s;imple peace; &s;ought in its natu|ral cour&s;e, and its ordinary haunts.&mdash;It is peace &s;ought in the &s;pirit of peace; and laid in principles purely pacific. I propo&s;e, by removing the ground of the difference, and by re&s;toring the <HI>former un|&s;u&s;pecting confidence of the colonies in the mother coun|try,</HI> to give permanent &s;atisfaction to your people; and (far from a &s;cheme of ruling by di&s;cord) to re|concile them to each other in the &s;ame act, and by the bond of the very &s;ame intere&s;t, which recon|ciles them to Briti&s;h government.</P>
<P>MY idea is nothing more. Refined policy ever has been the parent of confu&s;ion; and ever will be &s;o, as long as the world endures. Plain good intention, which is as ea&s;ily di&s;covered at the fir&s;t view, as fraud is &s;urely detected at la&s;t, is, let me &s;ay, of no mean force in the government of man|kind. Genuine &s;implicity of heart is an healing and cementing principle. My plan, therefore, be|ing formed upon the mo&s;t &s;imple grounds imagin|able, may di&s;appoint &s;ome people, when they hear it. It has nothing to recommend it to the pru|riency of curious ears. There is nothing at all new and captivating in it. It has nothing of the &s;plendour of the project, which has been lately laid upon your table by the noble lord in the blue ribband.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That when the governor, council, or a&s;&s;embly, or ge|neral court, of any of his maje&s;ty's provinces or colonies in America, &s;hall <HI>propo&s;e</HI> to make provi&s;ion, <HI>according to the condition, circum&s;tances,</HI> and <HI>&s;ituation,</HI> of &s;uch province or colony, for contributing their <HI>proportion</HI> to the <HI>common de|fence</HI> (&s;uch <HI>proportion</HI> to be rai&s;ed under the authority of the general court, or general a&s;&s;embly, of &s;uch province or co|lony, and di&s;po&s;able by parliament) and &s;hall <HI>engage</HI> to make provi&s;ion al&s;o for the &s;upport of the civil government, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in &s;uch province or colony, it will be proper, <HI>if &s;uch propo&s;al &s;hall be approved by his maje&s;ty, and the two hou&s;es of parliament,</HI> and for &s;o long as &s;uch pro|vi&s;ion &s;hall be made accordingly, to forbear, <HI>in re&s;pect of &s;uch province or colony,</HI> to levy any duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, or to impo&s;e any farther duty, tax, or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, except &s;uch duties as it may be expedient to continue to levy or im|po&s;e, for the regulation of commerce; the nett produce of the duties la&s;t mentioned to be carried to the account of &s;uch province or colony re&s;pectively."</Q>
Re&s;olution moved by lord North in the committee; and agreed to by the hou&s;e, 27 Feb. 1775.</P></NOTE> It does not propo&s;e to fill your lobby
<PB N="365" REF="361">
with &s;quabbling colony agents, who will require the interpo&s;ition of your mace, at every in&s;tant, to keep the peace among&s;t them. It does not in|&s;titute a magnificent auction of finance, where captivated provinces come to general ran&s;om by bidding again&s;t each other, until you knock down the hammer, and determine a proportion of pay|ments, beyond all the powers of algebra to equa|lize and &s;ettle.</P>
<P>THE plan, which I &s;hall pre&s;ume to &s;ugge&s;t, derives, however, one great advantage from the propo&s;ition and regi&s;try of that noble lord's project. The idea of conciliation is admi&s;&s;ible. Fir&s;t, the hou&s;e, in accepting the re&s;olution moved by the noble lord, has admitted, notwith&s;tanding the me|nacing front of our addre&s;s, notwith&s;tanding our heavy bill of pains and penalties&mdash;that we do not think our&s;elves precluded from all ideas of free grace and bounty.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e has gone farther; it has declared conciliation admi&s;&s;ible, <HI>previous</HI> to any &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the part of America. It has even &s;hot a good deal beyond that mark, and has admitted, that the complaints of our former mode of exerting the right of taxation were not wholly unfounded. That right thus exerted is allowed to have had &s;omething reprehen&s;ible in it; &s;omething unwi&s;e, or &s;omething
<PB N="366" REF="362">
grievous: &s;ince, in the mid&s;t of our heat and re|&s;entment, we, of our&s;elves, have propo&s;ed a capital alteration; and, in order to get rid of what &s;eemed &s;o very exceptionable, have in&s;tituted a mode that is altogether new; one that is, indeed, wholly alien from all the ancient methods and forms of parliament.</P>
<P>THE <HI>principle</HI> of this proceeding is large enough for my purpo&s;e. The means propo&s;ed by the noble lord for carrying his ideas into execution, I think indeed, are very indifferently &s;uited to the end; and this I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew you before I &s;it down. But, for the pre&s;ent, I take my ground on the admitted principle. I mean to give peace. Peace implies reconciliation; and where there has been a material di&s;pute, reconciliation does in a manner always imply conce&s;&s;ion on the one part or on the other. In this &s;tate of things I make no difficulty in affirming, that the propo&s;al ought to originate from us. Great and acknowledged force is not impaired, either in effect or in opinion, by an unwillingne&s;s to exert it&s;elf. The &s;uperior power may offer peace with honour and with &s;afety. Such an offer from &s;uch a power will be attributed to magnanimity. But the conce&s;&s;ions of the weak are the conce&s;&s;ions of fear. When &s;uch a one is di&s;|armed, he is wholly at the mercy of his &s;uperior; and he lo&s;es for ever that time and tho&s;e chances, which, as they happen to all men, are the &s;trength and re&s;ources of all inferior power.</P>
<P>THE capital leading que&s;tions on which you mu&s;t this day decide, are the&s;e two. Fir&s;t, whe|ther you ought to concede; and &s;econdly, what your conce&s;&s;ion ought to be. On the fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions we have gained (as I have ju&s;t taken the liberty of ob&s;erving to you) &s;ome ground. But I am &s;en&s;ible that a good deal more is &s;till to be
<PB N="367" REF="363">
done. Indeed, &s;ir, to enable us to determine both on the one and the other of the&s;e great que&s;tions with a firm and preci&s;e judgment, I think it may be nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ider di&s;tinctly the true nature and the peculiar circum&s;tances of the object which we have before us. Becau&s;e after all our &s;truggle, whether we will or not, we mu&s;t govern America, according to that nature, and to tho&s;e circum&s;tan|ces; and not according to our own imaginations; not according to ab&s;tract ideas of right; by no means according to mere general theories of go|vernment, the re&s;ort to which appears to me, in our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, no better than arrant trifling. I &s;hall therefore endeavour, with your leave, to lay before you &s;ome of the mo&s;t material of the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances in as full and as clear a manner as I am able to &s;tate them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing that we have to con&s;ider with regard to the nature of the object is&mdash;the number of people in the colonies. I have taken for &s;ome years a good deal of pains on that point. I can by no calculation ju&s;tify my&s;elf in placing the number below two millions of inhabitants of our own European blood and colour; be&s;ides at lea&s;t 500.000 others, who form no incon&s;iderable part of the &s;trength and opulence of the whole. This, &s;ir, is, I believe, about the true number. There is no occa&s;ion to exaggerate, where plain truth is of &s;o much weight and importance. But whether I put the pre&s;ent numbers too high or too low, is a matter of little moment. Such is the &s;trength with which population &s;hoots in that part of the world, that &s;tate the numbers as high as we will, whil&s;t the di&s;pute continues, the exaggeration ends. Whil&s;t we are di&s;cu&s;&s;ing any given magnitude, they are grown to it. Whil&s;t we &s;pend our time in deliberating on the mode of governing two mil|lions,
<PB N="368" REF="364">
we &s;hall find we have millions more to ma|nage. Your children do not grow fa&s;ter from infancy to manhood, than they &s;pread from fami|lies to communities, and from villages to nations.</P>
<P>I PUT this con&s;ideration of the pre&s;ent and the growing numbers in the front of our deliberation; becau&s;e, &s;ir, this con&s;ideration will make it evident to a blunter di&s;cernment than yours, that no par|tial, narrow, contracted, pinched, occa&s;ional &s;y&s;|tem will be at all &s;uitable to &s;uch an object. It will &s;hew you, that it is not to be con&s;idered as one of tho&s;e <HI>minima</HI> which are out of the eye and con&s;i|deration of the law; not a paltry excre&s;cence of the &s;tate; not a mean dependant, who may be neglected with little damage, and provoked with little danger. It will prove, that &s;ome degree of care and caution is required in the handling &s;uch an object; it will &s;hew, that you ought not, in rea&s;on, to trifle with &s;o large a ma&s;s of the inte|re&s;ts and feelings of the human race. You could at no time do &s;o without guilt; and be a&s;&s;ured you will not be able to do it long with impunity.</P>
<P>BUT the population of this country, the great and growing population, though a very important con&s;ideration, will lo&s;e much of its weight, if not combined with other circum&s;tances. The com|merce of your colonies is out of all proportion be|yond the numbers of the people. This ground of their commerce indeed has been trod &s;ome days ago, and with great ability, by a di&s;tingui&s;hed <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mr. Glover.</NOTE> per&s;on, at your bar. This gentleman, after thirty-five years&mdash;it is &s;o long &s;ince he fir&s;t appeared at the &s;ame place to plead for the commerce of Great Britain&mdash;has come again before you to plead the &s;ame cau&s;e, without any other effect of time, than, that to the fire of imagination and extent of
<PB N="369" REF="365">
erudition, which even then marked him as one of the fir&s;t literary characters of his age, he has added a con&s;ummate knowledge in the commercial inte|re&s;t of his country, formed by a long cour&s;e of en|lightened and di&s;criminating experience.</P>
<P>SIR, I &s;hould be inexcu&s;able in coming after &s;uch a per&s;on with any detail; if a great part of the members who now fill the hou&s;e had not the misfortune to be ab&s;ent, when he appeared at your bar. Be&s;ides, &s;ir, I propo&s;e to take the matter at periods of time &s;omewhat different from his. There is, if I mi&s;take not, a point of view, from whence if you will look at this &s;ubject, it is impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould not make an impre&s;&s;ion upon you.</P>
<P>I HAVE in my hand two accounts; one a com|parative &s;tate of the export trade of England to its colonies, as it &s;tood in the year 1704, and as it &s;tood in the year 1772. The other a &s;tate of the export trade of this country to its colonies alone, as it &s;tood in 1772, compared with the whole trade of England to all parts of the world (the colonies included) in the year 1704. They are from good vouchers; the latter period from the accounts on your table, the earlier from an original manu&s;cript of Davenant, who fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed the in&s;pector general's office, which has been ever &s;ince his time &s;o abundant a &s;ource of parliamentary informa|tion.</P>
<P>THE export trade to the colonies con&s;i&s;ts of three great branches. The African, which, ter|minating almo&s;t wholly in the colonies, mu&s;t be put to the account of their commerce; the We&s;t Indian; and the North American. All the&s;e are &s;o interwoven, that the attempt to &s;eparate them, would tear to pieces the contexture of the whole; and if not entirely de&s;troy, would very much de|preciate
<PB N="370" REF="366">
the value of all the parts. I therefore con&s;ider the&s;e three denominations to be, what in effect they are, one trade.</P>
<P>THE trade to the colonies, taken on the export &s;ide, at the beginning of this century, that is, in the year 1704, &s;tood thus:

<P>FROM five hundred and odd thou&s;and, it has grown to &s;ix millions. It has increa&s;ed no le&s;s than twelve-fold.

<P>THE trade with America alone is now within le&s;s than 500.000l. of being equal to what this great commercial nation, England, carried on at the beginning of this century with the whole world! If I had taken the large&s;t year of tho&s;e on your table, it would rather have exceeded. But, it will be &s;aid, is not this American trade an unna|tural protuberance, that has drawn the juices from the re&s;t of the body? The rever&s;e. It is the very food that has nouri&s;hed every other part into its pre&s;ent magnitude. Our general trade has been greatly augmented; and augmented more or le&s;s in almo&s;t every part to which it ever extended; but with this material difference; that of the &s;ix mil|lions which in the beginning of the century con|&s;tituted the whole ma&s;s of our export commerce, the colony trade was but one twelfth part; it is now (as a part of &s;ixteen millions) con&s;iderably more than a third of the whole. This is the relative proportion of the importance of the colonies at the&s;e two periods: and all rea&s;oning concerning our mode of treating them mu&s;t have this propor|tion as its ba&s;is; or it is a rea&s;oning weak, rotten, and &s;ophi&s;tical.</P>
<P>MR. SPEAKER, I cannot prevail on my&s;elf to hurry over this great con&s;ideration. It is good for us to be here. We &s;tand where we have an im|men&s;e view of what is, and what is pa&s;t. Clouds indeed, and darkne&s;s, re&s;t upon the future. Let us however, before we de&s;cend from this noble
<PB N="172" REF="368">
eminence, reflect that this growth of our national pro&s;perity has happened within the &s;hort period of the life of man. It has happened within &s;ixty-eight years. There are tho&s;e alive who&s;e memory might touch the two extremities. For in&s;tance, my lord Bathur&s;t might remember all the &s;tages of the pro|gre&s;s. He was in 1704 of an age, at lea&s;t to be made to comprehend &s;uch things. He was then old enough <HI>acta parentum jam legere, et quae &s;it pote|rit cogno&s;cere virtus</HI>&mdash;Suppo&s;e, &s;ir, that the angel of this au&s;picious youth, fore&s;eeing the many virtues, which made him one of the mo&s;t amiable, as he is one of the mo&s;t fortunate men of his age, had opened to him in vi&s;ion, that, when, in the fourth generation, the third prince of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick had &s;at twelve years on the throne of that nation, which (by the happy i&s;&s;ue of moderate and healing coun|cils) was to be made Great Britain, he &s;hould &s;ee his &s;on, lord chancellor of England, turn back the current of hereditary dignity to its fountain, and rai&s;e him to an higher rank of peerage, whil&s;t he enriched the family with a new one&mdash;If amid&s;t the&s;e bright and happy &s;cenes of dome&s;tic honour and pro&s;perity, that angel &s;hould have drawn up the curtain, and unfolded the ri&s;ing glories of his country, and whil&s;t he was gazing with admiration on the then commercial grandeur of England, the genius &s;hould point out to him a little &s;peck, &s;carce vi&s;ible in the ma&s;s of the national intere&s;t, a &s;mall &s;eminal principle, rather than a formed body, and &s;hould tell him&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Young man, There is America&mdash;which at this day &s;erves for little more than to amu&s;e you with &s;tories of &s;avage men, and un|couth manners; yet &s;hall, before you ta&s;te of death, &s;hew it&s;elf equal to the whole of that commerce which now attracts the envy of the world. Whatever England has been growing
<PB N="373" REF="369">
to by a progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of improvement, brought in by varieties of people, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of civilizing conque&s;ts and civilizing &s;ettlements in a &s;eries of &s;eventeen hundred years, you &s;hall &s;ee as much added to her by America in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle life!"</Q>
If this &s;tate of his country had been foretold to him, would it not require all the &s;anguine credulity of youth, and all the fervid glow of enthu&s;ia&s;m, to make him believe it? For|tunate man, he has lived to &s;ee it! Fortunate indeed, if he lives to &s;ee nothing that &s;hall vary the pro&s;pect, and cloud the &s;etting of his day!</P>
<P>EXCUSE me, &s;ir, if turning from &s;uch thoughts I re&s;ume this comparative view once more. You have &s;een it on a large &s;cale; look at it on a &s;mall one. I will point out to your attention a particular in&s;tance of it in the &s;ingle province of Pen&s;ylvania. In the year 1704 that province called for 11.459l. in value of your commo|dities, native and foreign. This was the whole. What did it demand in 1772? Why nearly fifty times as much; for in that year the export to Pen&s;ylvania was 507.909l. nearly equal to the export to all the colonies together in the fir&s;t period.</P>
<P>I CHOOSE, &s;ir, to enter into the&s;e minute and particular details; becau&s;e generalities, which in all other ca&s;es are apt to heighten and rai&s;e the &s;ub|ject, have here a tendency to &s;ink it. When we &s;peak of the commerce with our colonies, fiction lags after truth; invention is unfruitful, and ima|gination cold and barren.</P>
<P>So far, &s;ir, as to the importance of the object in the view of its commerce, as concerned in the ex|ports from England. If I were to detail the im|ports, I could &s;hew how many enjoyments they
<PB N="374" REF="370">
procure, which deceive the burthen of life; how many materials which invigorate the &s;prings of na|tional indu&s;try, and extend and animate every part of our foreign and dome&s;tic commerce. This would be a curious &s;ubject indeed&mdash;but I mu&s;t pre|&s;cribe bounds to my&s;elf in a matter &s;o va&s;t and va|rious.</P>
<P>I PASS therefore to the colonies in another point of view, their agriculture. This they have pro|&s;ecuted with &s;uch a &s;pirit, that, be&s;ides feeding plentifully their own growing multitude, their an|nual export of grain, comprehending rice, has &s;ome years ago exceeded a million in value. Of their la&s;t harve&s;t, I am per&s;uaded, they will export much more. At the beginning of the century, &s;ome of the&s;e colonies imported corn from the mo|ther country. For &s;ome time pa&s;t, the old world has been fed from the new. The &s;carcity which you have felt would have been a de&s;olating famine; if this child of your old age, with a true filial piety, with a Roman charity, had not put the full brea&s;t of its youthful exuberance to the mouth of its exhau&s;ted parent.</P>
<P>AS to the wealth which the colonies have drawn from the &s;ea by their fi&s;heries, you had all that matter fully opened at your bar. You &s;urely thought tho&s;e acqui&s;itions of value; for they &s;eemed even to excite your envy; and yet the &s;pirit, by which that enterprizing employment has been ex|erci&s;ed, ought rather, in my opinion, to have rai&s;ed your e&s;teem and admiration. And pray, &s;ir, what in the world is equal to it? Pa&s;s by the other parts, and look at the manner in which the people of New England have of late carried on the whale fi&s;hery. Whil&s;t we follow them among the jumbling mountains of ice, and behold them pene|trating into the deepe&s;t frozen rece&s;&s;es of Hud&s;on's
<PB N="375" REF="371">
Bay, and Davis's Streights, whil&s;t we are looking for them beneath the Arctic circle, we hear that they have pierced into the oppo&s;ite region of polar cold, that they are at the Antipodes, and engaged under the frozen &s;erpent of the &s;outh. Falkland I&s;land, which &s;eemed too remote and romantic an object for the gra&s;p of national ambition, is but a &s;tage and re&s;ting-place in the progre&s;s of their vic|torious indu&s;try. Nor is the equinoctial heat more di&s;couraging to them, than the accumulated winter of both the poles. We know that whil&s;t &s;ome of them draw the line and &s;trike the harpoon on the coa&s;t of Africa, others run the longitude, and pur|&s;ue their gigantic game along the coa&s;t of Bra|zil. No &s;ea but what is vexed by their fi&s;heries. No climate that is not witne&s;s to their toils. Nei|ther the per&s;everance of Holland, nor the activity of France, nor the dextrous and firm &s;agacity of Engli&s;h enterprize, ever carried this mo&s;t perilous mode of hardy indu&s;try to the extent to which it has been pu&s;hed by this recent people; a people who are &s;till, as it were, but in the gri&s;tle, and not yet hardened into the bone of manhood. When I contemplate the&s;e things; when I know that the colonies in general owe little or nothing to any care of ours, and that they are not &s;queezed into this happy form by the con&s;traints of watchful and &s;u&s;|picious government, but that through a wi&s;e and &s;alutary neglect, a generous nature has been &s;uffered to take her own way to perfection: when I reflect upon the&s;e effects, when I &s;ee how profitable they have been to us, I feel all the pride of power &s;ink, and all pre&s;umption in the wi&s;dom of human con|trivances melt, and die away within me. My rigour relents. I pardon &s;omething to the &s;pirit of li|berty.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, &s;ir, that all which I have a&s;&s;erted in my detail, is admitted in the gro&s;s; but that
<PB N="376" REF="372">
quite a different conclu&s;ion is drawn from it. Ame|rica, gentlemen &s;ay, is a noble object. It is an object well worth fighting for. Certainly it is, if fighting a people be the be&s;t way of gaining them. Gentlemen in this re&s;pect will be led to their choice of means by their complexions and their habits. Tho&s;e who under&s;tand the military art, will of cour&s;e have &s;ome predilection for it. Tho&s;e who wield the thunder of the &s;tate, may have more confidence in the efficacy of arms. But I confe&s;s, po&s;&s;ibly for want of this knowledge, my opinion is much more in favour of prudent management, than of force; con&s;idering force not as an odious, but a feeble in&s;trument, for pre&s;erving a people &s;o nu|merous, &s;o active, &s;o growing, &s;o &s;pirited as this, in a profitable and &s;ubordinate connexion with us.</P>
<P>FIRST, &s;ir, permit me to ob&s;erve, that the u&s;e of force alone is but <HI>temporary.</HI> It may &s;ubdue for a moment; but it does not remove the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubduing again: and a nation is not governed, which is perpetually to be conquered.</P>
<P>MY next objection is its <HI>uncertainty.</HI> Terror is not always the effect of force; and an armament is not a victory. If you do not &s;ucceed, you are without re&s;ource; for, conciliation failing, force re|mains; but, force failing, no further hope of recon|ciliation is re&s;t. Power and authority are &s;ome|times bought by kindne&s;s; but they can never be begged as alms, by an impoveri&s;hed and de|feated violence.</P>
<P>A FURTHER objection to force is, that you <HI>im|pair the object</HI> by your very endeavours to pre&s;erve it. The thing you fought for, is not the thing which you recover; but depreciated, &s;unk, wa&s;ted, and con&s;umed in the conte&s;t. Nothing le&s;s will content me, than <HI>whole America.</HI> I do not choo&s;e
<PB N="377" REF="373">
to con&s;ume its &s;trength along with our own; be|cau&s;e in all parts it is the Briti&s;h &s;trength that I con|&s;ume. I do not choo&s;e to be caught by a foreign enemy at the end of this exhau&s;ting conflict; and &s;till le&s;s in the mid&s;t of it. I may e&s;cape; but I can make no in&s;urance again&s;t &s;uch an event. Let me add, that I do not choo&s;e wholly to break the American &s;pirit, becau&s;e it is the &s;pirit that has made the country.</P>
<P>LASTLY, we have no &s;ort of <HI>experience</HI> in fa|vour of force as an in&s;trument in the rule of our colonies. Their growth and their utility has been owing to methods altogether different. Our an|cient indulgence has been &s;aid to be pur&s;ued to a fault. It may be &s;o. But we know, if feeling is evidence, that our fault was more tolerable than our attempt to mend it; and our &s;in far more &s;alutary than our penitence.</P>
<P>THESE, &s;ir, are my rea&s;ons for not entertaining that high opinion of untried force, by which many gentlemen, for who&s;e &s;entiments in other particu|lars I have great re&s;pect, &s;eem to be &s;o greatly capti|vated. But there is &s;till behind a third con&s;ideration concerning this object, which &s;erves to determine my opinion on the &s;ort of policy which ought to be pur&s;ued in the management of America, even more than its population and its commerce, I mean its <HI>temper and character.</HI></P>
<P>IN this character of the Americans, a love of free|dom is the predominating feature, which marks and di&s;tingui&s;hes the whole: and as an ardent is always a jealous affection, your colonies become &s;u&s;|picious, re&s;tive, and untractable, whenever they &s;ee the lea&s;t attempt to wre&s;t from them by force, or &s;huffle from them by chicane, what they think the only advantage worth living for. This fierce &s;pirit
<PB N="378" REF="374">
of liberty is &s;tronger in the Engli&s;h colonies proba|bly than in any other people of the earth; and this from a great variety of powerful cau&s;es; which, to under&s;tand the true temper of their minds, and the direction which this &s;pirit takes, it will not be ami&s;s to lay open &s;omewhat more largely.</P>
<P>FIRST, the people of the colonies are de&s;cend|ents of Engli&s;hmen. England, &s;ir, is a nation, which &s;till I hope re&s;pects, and formerly adored, her freedom. The coloni&s;ts emigrated from you, when this part of your character was mo&s;t predomi|nant; and they took this bia&s;s and direction the moment they parted from your hands. They are therefore not only devoted to liberty, but to liberty according to Engli&s;h ideas, and on Engli&s;h princi|ples. Ab&s;tract liberty, like other mere ab&s;tracti|ons, is not to be found. Liberty inheres in &s;ome &s;en&s;ible object; and every nation has formed to it|&s;elf &s;ome favourite point, which by way of eminence becomes the criterion of their happine&s;s. It hap|pened, you know, &s;ir, that the great conte&s;ts for freedom in this country were from the earlie&s;t times chiefly upon the que&s;tion of taxing. Mo&s;t of the conte&s;ts in the ancient commonwealths turned primarily on the right of election of magi&s;trates; or on the balance among the &s;everal orders of the &s;tate. The que&s;tion of money was not with them &s;o immediate. But in England it was otherwi&s;e. On this point of taxes the able&s;t pens, and mo&s;t eloquent tongues have been exerci&s;ed; the greate&s;t &s;pirits have acted and &s;uffered. In order to give the fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction concerning the importance of this point, it was not only nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e who in argument defended the excellence of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, to in&s;i&s;t on this privilege of granting money as a dry point of fact, and to prove, that the right had been acknowledged in ancient parch|ments,
<PB N="379" REF="375">
and blind u&s;ages, to re&s;ide in a certain body called an hou&s;e of commons. They went much further; they attempted to prove, and they &s;uc|ceeded, that in theory it ought to be &s;o, from the particular nature of a hou&s;e of commons, as an im|mediate repre&s;entative of the people; whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not. They took infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental principle, that, in all monarchies, the people mu&s;t in effect them&s;elves mediately or immediately po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of granting their own money, or no &s;ha|dow of liberty could &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The colonies draw from you as with their life-blood, the&s;e ideas and principles. Their love of liberty, as with you, fixed and attached on this &s;pecific point of taxing. Liberty might be &s;afe, or might be endangered in twenty other particulars, without their being much plea&s;ed or alarmed. Here they felt its pul&s;e; and as they found that beat, they thought them&s;elves &s;ick or &s;ound. I do not &s;ay whether they were right or wrong in applying your general arguments to their own ca&s;e. It is not ea&s;y indeed to make a monopoly of theorems and corollaries. The fact is, that they did thus apply tho&s;e general arguments; and your mode of governing them, whether through lenity or indolence, through wi&s;dom or mi&s;take, confirmed them in the imagination, that they, as well as you, had an intere&s;t in the&s;e common prin|ciples.</P>
<P>THEY were further confirmed in this plea&s;ing er|ror by the form of their provincial legi&s;lative a&s;&s;em|blies. Their governments are popular in an high degree; &s;ome are merely popular; in all, the po|pular repre&s;entative is the mo&s;t weighty; and this &s;hare of the people in their ordinary government never fails to in&s;pire them with lofty &s;entiments, and with a &s;trong aver&s;ion from whatever tends to deprive them of their chief importance.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="376">IF any thing were wanting to this nece&s;&s;ary ope|ration of the form of government, religion would have given it a complete effect. Religion, always a principle of energy, in this new people, is no way worn out or impaired; and their mode of profe&s;&s;ing it is al&s;o one main cau&s;e of this free &s;pirit. The people are prote&s;tants; and of that kind, which is the mo&s;t adver&s;e to all implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of mind and opinion. This is a per&s;ua&s;ion not only favour|able to liberty, but built upon it. I do not think, &s;ir, that the rea&s;on of this aver&s;ene&s;s in the di&s;&s;ent|ing churches from all that looks like ab&s;olute go|vernment is &s;o much to be &s;ought in their religious tenets, as in their hi&s;tory. Every one knows, that the Roman Catholic religion is at lea&s;t coeval with mo&s;t of the governments where it prevails; that it has generally gone hand in hand with them; and received great favour and every kind of &s;upport from authority. The church of England too was formed from her cradle under the nur&s;ing care of regular government. But the di&s;&s;enting intere&s;ts have &s;prung up in direct oppo&s;ition to all the ordi|nary powers of the world; and could ju&s;tify that oppo&s;ition only on a &s;trong claim to natural liberty. Their very exi&s;tence depended on the powerful and unremitted a&s;&s;ertion of that claim. All prote&s;|tanti&s;m, even the mo&s;t cold and pa&s;&s;ive, is a &s;ort of di&s;&s;ent. But the religion mo&s;t prevalent in our northern colonies is a refinement on the principle of re&s;i&s;tance; it is the di&s;&s;idence of di&s;&s;ent; and the prote&s;tanti&s;m of the prote&s;tant religion. This reli|gion, under a variety of denominations, agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the &s;pirit of liberty, is predominant in mo&s;t of the northern pro|vinces; where the church of England, notwith|&s;tanding its legal rights, is in reality no more than a &s;ort of private &s;ect, not compo&s;ing mo&s;t probably the tenth of the people. The coloni&s;ts left England
<PB N="381" REF="377">
when this &s;pirit was high; and in the emigrants was the highe&s;t of all: and even that &s;tream of fo|reigners, which has been con&s;tantly flowing into the&s;e colonies, has, for the greate&s;t part, been compo&s;ed of di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hments of their &s;everal countries, and have brought with them a temper and character far from alien to that of the people with whom they mixed.</P>
<P>SIR, I can perceive by their manner, that &s;ome gentlemen object to the latitude of this de&s;cription; becau&s;e in the &s;outhern colonies the church of Eng|land forms a large body, and has a regular e&s;ta|bli&s;hment. It is certainly true. There is however a circum&s;tance attending the&s;e colonies, which in my opinion, fully counterbalances this difference, and makes the &s;pirit of liberty &s;till more high and haughty than in tho&s;e to the northward. It is that in Virginia and the Carolinas, they have a va&s;t mul|titude of &s;laves. Where this is the ca&s;e in any part of the world, tho&s;e who are free, are by far the mo&s;t proud and jealous of their freedom. Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank and privilege. Not &s;eeing there, that free|dom, as in countries where it is a common ble&s;&s;ing, and as broad and general as the air, may be united with much abject toil, with great mi&s;ery, with all the exterior of &s;ervitude, liberty looks among&s;t them, like &s;omething that is more noble and liberal. I do not mean, &s;ir, to commend the &s;uperior mora|lity of this &s;entiment, which has at lea&s;t as much pride as virtue in it; but I cannot alter the nature of man. The fact is &s;o; and the&s;e people of the &s;outhern colonies are much more &s;trongly, and with an higher and more &s;tubborn &s;pirit, attached to liberty than tho&s;e to the northward. Such were all the ancient commonwealths; &s;uch were our Gothic ance&s;tors; &s;uch in our days were the Poles;
<PB N="382" REF="378">
and &s;uch will be all ma&s;ters of &s;laves, who are not &s;laves them&s;elves. In &s;uch a people the haughtine&s;s of domination combines with the &s;pirit of freedom, fortifies it, and renders it invincible.</P>
<P>PERMIT me, &s;ir, to add another circum&s;tance in our colonies, which contributes no mean part to|wards the growth and effect of this untractable &s;pirit. I mean their education. In no country perhaps in the world is the law &s;o general a &s;tudy The profe&s;&s;ion it&s;elf is numerous and powerful; and in mo&s;t provinces it takes the lead. The greater number of the deputies &s;ent to the congre&s;s were lawyers. But all who read, and mo&s;t do read, en|deavour to obtain &s;ome &s;mattering in that &s;cience. I have been told by an eminent book&s;eller, that in no branch of his bu&s;ine&s;s, after tracts of popular de|votion, were &s;o many books as tho&s;e on the law ex|ported to the plantations. The coloni&s;ts have now fallen into the way of printing them for their own u&s;e. I hear that they have &s;old nearly as many of Black&s;tone's Commentaries in America as in Eng|land. General Gage marks out this di&s;po&s;ition ve|ry particularly in a letter on your table. He &s;tates, that all the people in his government are lawyers, or &s;matterers in law; and that in Bo&s;ton they have been enabled, by &s;ucce&s;sful chicane, wholly to evade many parts of one of your capital penal con|&s;titutions. The &s;martne&s;s of debate will &s;ay, that this knowledge ought to teach them more clearly the rights of legi&s;lature, their obligations to obedi|ence, and the penalties of rebellion. All this is mighty well. But my <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Attorney General.</NOTE> honourable and learned friend on the floor, who conde&s;cends to mark what I &s;ay for animadver&s;ion, will di&s;dain that ground. He has heard as well as I, that when great honours and great emoluments do not win over this know|ledge
<PB N="383" REF="379">
to the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, it is a formidable adver&s;ary to government. If the &s;pirit be not tam|ed and broken by the&s;e happy methods, it is &s;tub|born and litigious. <HI>Abeunt &s;tudia in mores.</HI> This &s;tudy renders men acute, inqui&s;itive, dextrous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, full of re|&s;ources. In other countries, the people, more &s;im|ple and of a le&s;s mercurial ca&s;t, judge of an ill prin|ciple in government only by an actual grievance; here they anticipate the evil, and judge of the pre&s;|&s;ure of the grievance by the badne&s;s of the princi|ple. They augur mi&s;government at a di&s;tance; and &s;nuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t cau&s;e of this di&s;obedient &s;pirit in the co|lonies is hardly le&s;s powerful than the re&s;t, as it is not merely moral, but laid deep in the natural con|&s;titution of things. Three thou&s;and miles of ocean lie between you and them. No contrivance can prevent the effect of this di&s;tance, in weakening government. Seas roll, and months pa&s;s, between the order and the execution; and the want of a &s;peedy explanation of a &s;ingle point is enough to defeat an whole &s;y&s;tem. You have, indeed, wing|ed mini&s;ters of vengeance, who carry your bolts in their pounces to the remote&s;t verge of the &s;ea. But there a power &s;teps in, that limits the arrogance of raging pa&s;&s;ions and furious elements, and &s;ays, "So far &s;halt thou go, and no farther." Who are you, that &s;hould fret and rage, and bite the chains of nature?&mdash;Nothing wor&s;e happens to you, than does to all nations, who have exten&s;ive empire; and it happens in all the forms into which empire can be thrown. In large bodies, the circulation of power mu&s;t be le&s;s vigorous at the extremities. Nature has &s;aid it. The turk cannot govern Aegypt, and Arabia, and Curdi&s;tan, as he governs
<PB N="384" REF="380">
Thrace; nor has he the &s;ame dominion in Crimea and Algiers, which he has at Bru&s;a and Smyrna. De&s;poti&s;m it&s;elf is obliged to truck and huck&s;ter. The &s;ultan gets &s;uch obedience as he can. He governs with a loo&s;e rein, that he may govern at all; and the whole of the force and vigour of his autho|rity in his centre, is derived from a prudent relaxa|tion in all his borders. Spain, in her provinces, is, perhaps, not &s;o well obeyed, as you are in yours. She complies too; &s;he &s;ubmits; &s;he watches times. This is the immutable condition; the eternal law, of exten&s;ive and detached empire.</P>
<P>THEN, &s;ir, from the&s;e &s;ix capital &s;ources; of de&s;cent; of form of government; of religion in the northern provinces; of manners in the &s;outhern; of education; of the remotene&s;s of &s;ituation from the fir&s;t mover of government; from all the&s;e cau&s;es a fierce &s;pirit of liberty has grown up. It has grown with the growth of the people in your colo|nies, and increa&s;ed with the increa&s;e of their wealth; a &s;pirit, that unhappily meeting with an exerci&s;e of power in England, which, however lawful, is not reconcilable to any ideas of liberty, much le&s;s with theirs, has kindled this flame, that is ready to con&s;ume us.</P>
<P>I DO not mean to commend either the &s;pirit in this exce&s;s, or the moral cau&s;es which produce it. Perhaps a more &s;mooth and accommodating &s;pirit of freedom in them would be more acceptable to us. Perhaps ideas of liberty might be de&s;ired, more reconcilable with an arbitrary and boundle&s;s authority. Perhaps we might wi&s;h the coloni&s;ts to be per&s;uaded, that their liberty is more &s;ecure when held in tru&s;t for them by us (as their guardians dur|ing a perpetual minority) than with any part of it in their own hands. But the que&s;tion is, not whe|ther their &s;pirit de&s;erves prai&s;e or blame;&mdash;what, in
<PB N="385" REF="381">
the name of God, &s;hall we do with it? You have before you the object; &s;uch as it is, with all its glories, with all its imperfections on its head. You &s;ee the magnitude; the importance; the temper; the habits; the di&s;orders. By all the&s;e con&s;iderations, we are &s;trongly urged to determine &s;omething concerning it. We are call|ed upon to fix &s;ome rule and line for our future conduct, which may give a little &s;tability to our politics, and prevent the return of &s;uch unhap|py deliberations as the pre&s;ent. Every &s;uch return will bring the matter before us in a &s;till more un|tractable form. For, what a&s;toni&s;hing and incre|dible things have we not &s;een already? What mon|&s;ters have not been generated from this unnatural contention? Whil&s;t every principle of authority and re&s;i&s;tance has been pu&s;hed, upon both &s;ides, as far as it would go, there is nothing &s;o &s;olid and cer|tain, either in rea&s;oning or in practice, that has been not &s;haken. Until very lately, all authority in America &s;eemed to be nothing but an emanation from yours. Even the popular part of the colony con&s;titution derived all its activity, and its fir&s;t vi|tal movement, from the plea&s;ure of the crown. We thought, &s;ir, that the utmo&s;t which the di&s;con|tented coloni&s;ts could do, was to di&s;turb authority; we never dreamt they could of them&s;elves &s;upply it; knowing in general what an opero&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to e&s;tabli&s;h a government ab&s;olutely new. But having, for our purpo&s;es in this contention, re|&s;olved, that none but an obedient a&s;&s;embly &s;hould &s;it, the humours of the people there, finding all pa&s;&s;age through the legal channel &s;topped, with great violence broke out another way. Some pro|vinces have tried their experiment, as we have tried ours; and theirs has &s;ucceeded. They have formed a government &s;ufficient for its purpo&s;es, without the bu&s;tle of a revolution, or the trouble&s;ome formality of an election. Evident nece&s;&s;ity, and tacit con|&s;ent,
<PB N="386" REF="382">
have done the bu&s;ine&s;s in an in&s;tant. So well they have done it, that lord Dunmore (the account is among the fragments on your table) tells you, that the new in&s;titution is infinitely better obeyed than the antient government ever was in its mo&s;t fortunate period. Obedience is what makes go|vernment, and not the names by which it is called; not the name of governor, as formerly, or commit|tee, as at pre&s;ent. This new government has ori|ginated directly from the people; and was not tran&s;mitted through any of the ordinary artificial media of a po&s;itive con&s;titution. It was not a ma|nufacture ready formed, and tran&s;mitted to them in that condition from England. The evil ari&s;ing from hence is this; that the coloni&s;ts having once found the po&s;&s;ibility of enjoying the advantages of order, in the mid&s;t of a &s;truggle for liberty, &s;uch &s;truggles will not henceforward &s;eem &s;o terrible to the &s;ettled and &s;ober part of mankind, as they had appeared before the trial.</P>
<P>PURSUING the &s;ame plan of puni&s;hing by the denial of the exerci&s;e of government to &s;till greater lengths, we wholly abrogated the antient govern|ment of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et. We were confident, that the fir&s;t feeling, if not the very pro&s;pect of anarchy, would in&s;tantly enforce a compleat &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. The experiment was tried. A new, &s;trange, unex|pected face of things appeared. Anarchy is found tolerable. A va&s;t province has now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in a con&s;iderable degree of health and vi|gour, for near a twelvemonth, without governor, without public council, without judges, without ex|ecutive magi&s;trates. How long it will continue in this &s;tate, or what may ari&s;e out of this unheard-of &s;ituation, how can the wi&s;e&s;t of us conjecture? Our late experience has taught us, that many of tho&s;e fundamental principles, formerly believed in|fallible,
<PB N="387" REF="383">
are either not of the importance they were imagined to be; or that we have not at all ad|verted to &s;ome other far more important, and far more powerful principles, which entirely over-rule tho&s;e we had con&s;idered as omnipotent. I am much again&s;t any further experiments, which tend to put to the proof any more of the&s;e allowed opi|nions, which contribute &s;o much to the public tran|quillity. In effect, we &s;uffer as much at home, by this loo&s;ening of all ties, and this concu&s;&s;ion of all e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions, as we do abroad. For, in order to prove, that the Americans have no right to their liberties, we are every day endeavouring to &s;ubvert the maxims, which pre&s;erve the whole &s;pirit of our own. To prove that the Americans ought not to be free, we are obliged to depreciate the value of freedom it&s;elf; and we never &s;eem to gain a paltry advantage over them in debate, with|out attacking &s;ome of tho&s;e principles, or deriding &s;ome of tho&s;e feelings, for which our ance&s;tors have &s;hed their blood.</P>
<P>BUT, &s;ir, in wi&s;hing to put an end to pernicious experiments, I do not mean to preclude the fulle&s;t enquiry. Far from it. Far from deciding on a &s;udden or partial view, I would patiently go round and round the &s;ubject, and &s;urvey it minutely in every po&s;&s;ible a&s;pect. Sir, if I were capable of en|gaging you to an equal attention, I would &s;tate, that, as far as I am capable of di&s;cerning, there are but three ways of proceeding relative to this &s;tub|born &s;pirit, which prevails in your colonies, and di|&s;turbs your government. The&s;e are&mdash;To change that &s;pirit, as inconvenient, by removing the cau&s;es. To pro&s;ecute it as criminal. Or, to comply with it as nece&s;&s;ary. I would not be guilty of an imper|fect enumeration; I can think of but the&s;e three. Another has indeed been &s;tarted, that of giving up
<PB N="388" REF="384">
the colonies; but it met &s;o &s;light a reception, that I do not think my&s;elf obliged to dwell a great while upon it. It is nothing but a little &s;ally of anger; like the frowardne&s;s of peevi&s;h children; who, when they cannot get all they would have, are re&s;olved to take nothing.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e plans, to change the &s;pirit as inconvenient, by removing the cau&s;es, I think is the mo&s;t like a &s;y&s;tematic proceeding. It is radical in its principle; but it is attended with great dif|ficulties, &s;ome of them little &s;hort, as I conceive, of impo&s;&s;ibilities. This will appear by examining into the plans which have been propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>AS the growing population in the colonies is evidently one cau&s;e of their re&s;i&s;tance, it was la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion mentioned in both hou&s;es, by men of weight, and received not without applau&s;e, that, in order to check this evil, it would be proper for the crown to make no further grants of land. But to this &s;cheme, there are two objections. The fir&s;t, that there is already &s;o much un&s;ettled land in private hands, as to afford room for an immen&s;e future population, although the crown not only withheld its grants, but annihilated its &s;oil. If this be the ca&s;e, then the only effect of this avarice of de&s;olation, this hoarding of a royal wilderne&s;s, would be to rai&s;e the value of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the hands of the great private monopoli&s;ts, without any adequate check to the growing and alarming mi&s;chief of popu|lation.</P>
<P>BUT, if you &s;topped your grants, what would be the con&s;equence? The people would occupy without grants. They have already &s;o occupied in many places. You cannot &s;tation garri&s;ons in every part of the&s;e de&s;erts. If you drive the people from one place, they will carry on their annual
<PB N="389" REF="385">
tillage, and remove with their flocks and herds to another. Many of the people in the back &s;ettle|ments are already little attached to particular &s;itua|tions. Already they have topped the Apalachian mountains. From thence they behold before them an immen&s;e plain, one va&s;t, rich, level meadow; a &s;quare of five hundred miles. Over this they would wander, without a po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;traint; they would change their manners with the habits of their life; would &s;oon forget a government, by which they were di&s;owned; would become Hordes of Engli&s;h Tartars; and, pouring down upon your unfortified frontiers a fierce and irre&s;i&s;tible cavalry, become ma&s;ters of your governors and your coun|&s;ellors, your collectors and comptrollers, and of all the &s;laves that adhered to them. Such would, and, in no long time, mu&s;t be, the effect of at|tempting to forbid as a crime, and to &s;uppre&s;s as an evil, the command and ble&s;&s;ing of Providence, <Q REND="inline">"encrea&s;e and multiply."</Q> Such would be the happy re&s;ult of an endeavour to keep as a lair of wild bea&s;ts, that earth, which God by an expre&s;s charter, has given to the children of men. Far dif|ferent, and &s;urely much wi&s;er, has been our policy hitherto. Hitherto we have invited our people by every kind of bounty, to fixed e&s;tabli&s;hments. We have invited the hu&s;bandman, to look to authority for his title. We have taught him piou&s;ly to believe in the my&s;terious virtue of wax and parchment. We have thrown each tract of land, as it was peo|pled, into di&s;tricts; that the ruling power &s;hould never be wholly out of &s;ight. We have &s;ettled all we could; and we have carefully attended every &s;ettlement with government.</P>
<P>ADHERING, &s;ir, as I do, to this policy, as well as for the rea&s;ons I have ju&s;t given, I think this new
<PB N="390" REF="386">
project of hedging-in population to be neither pru|dent nor practicable.</P>
<P>TO impoveri&s;h the colonies in general, and in particular to arre&s;t the noble cour&s;e of their marine enterprizes, would be a more ea&s;y ta&s;k. I freely confe&s;s it. We have &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to a &s;y&s;tem of this kind; a di&s;po&s;ition even to continue the re|&s;traint after the offence; looking on our&s;elves as ri|vals to our colonies, and per&s;uaded that of cour&s;e we mu&s;t gain all that they &s;hall lo&s;e. Much mi&s;|chief we may certainly do. The power inadequate to all other things is often more than &s;ufficient for this. I do not look on the direct and immediate power of the colonies to re&s;i&s;t our violence, as very formidable. In this, however, I may be mi&s;taken. But when I con&s;ider, that we have colonies for no purpo&s;e but to be &s;erviceable to us, it &s;eems to my poor under&s;tanding a little prepo&s;terous, to make them un&s;erviceable, in order to keep them obedient. It is, in truth, nothing more than the old, and, as I thought, exploded problem of tyranny which pro|po&s;es to beggar its &s;ubjects into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But, remember, when you have compleated your &s;y&s;tem of impoveri&s;hment, that nature &s;till proceeds in her ordinary cour&s;e; that di&s;content will encrea&s;e with mi&s;ery; and that there are critical moments in the fortune of all &s;tates, when they, who are too weak to contribute to your pro&s;perity, may be &s;trong enough to complete your ruin. <HI>Spoliatis arma &s;uper&s;unt.</HI></P>
<P>THE temper and character which prevail in our colonies, are, I am afraid, unalterable by any human art. We cannot, I fear, fal&s;ify the pedigree of this fierce people, and per&s;uade them that they are not &s;prung from a nation, in who&s;e veins the blood of freedom circulates. The language in which they
<PB N="391" REF="387">
would hear you tell them this tale, would detect the impo&s;ition; your &s;peech would betray you. An Engli&s;hman is the unfitte&s;t per&s;on on earth to argue another Engli&s;hman into &s;lavery.</P>
<P>I THINK it is nearly as little in our power to change their republican religion, as their free de&s;cent; or to &s;ub&s;titute the Roman Catholic, as a penalty; or the church of England, as an improve|ment. The mode of inqui&s;ition and dragooning, is going out of fa&s;hion in the old world; and I &s;hould not confide much to their efficacy in the new. The education of the Americans is al&s;o on the &s;ame unalterable bottom with their religion. You can|not per&s;uade them to burn their books of curious &s;cience; to bani&s;h their lawyers from their courts of law; or to quench the lights of their a&s;&s;emblies, by refu&s;ing to choo&s;e tho&s;e per&s;ons who are be&s;t read in their privileges. It would be no le&s;s impracti|cable to think of wholly annihilating the popular a&s;|&s;emblies, in which the&s;e lawyers &s;it. The army, by which we mu&s;t govern in their place, would be far more chargeable to us; not quite &s;o effectual; and perhaps, in the end, full as difficult to be kept in obe|dience.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the high ari&s;tocratic &s;pirit of Virginia and the &s;outhern colonies, it has been propo&s;ed, I know, to reduce it, by declaring a general enfranchi&s;ement of their &s;laves. This pro|ject has had its advocates and panegyri&s;ts; yet I never could argue my&s;elf into any opinion of it. Slaves are often much attached to their ma&s;ters. A general wild offer of liberty, would not always be accepted. Hi&s;tory furni&s;hes few in&s;tances of it. It is &s;ometimes as hard to per&s;uade &s;laves to be free, as it is to compel freemen to be &s;laves; and in this au&s;picious &s;cheme, we &s;hould have both the&s;e plea&s;ing ta&s;ks on our hands at once. But when we
<PB N="392" REF="388">
talk of enfranchi&s;ement, do we not perceive that the American ma&s;ter may enfranchi&s;e too; and arm &s;ervile hands in defence of freedom? A mea&s;ure to which other people have had recour&s;e more than once, and not without &s;ucce&s;s, in a de&s;perate &s;itua|tion of their affairs.</P>
<P>SLAVES as the&s;e unfortunate black people are, and dull as all men are from &s;lavery, mu&s;t they not a little &s;u&s;pect the offer of freedom from that very nation which has &s;old them to their pre&s;ent ma&s;ters? From that nation, one of who&s;e cau&s;es of quarrel with tho&s;e ma&s;ters, is their refu&s;al to deal any more in that inhuman traffic? An offer of freedom from England, would come rather oddly, &s;hipped to them in an African ve&s;&s;el, which is refu&s;ed an entry into the ports of Virginia or Ca|rolina, with a cargo of three hundred Angola ne|groes. It would be curious to &s;ee the Guinea cap|tain attempting at the &s;ame in&s;tant to publi&s;h his proclamation of liberty, and to adverti&s;e his &s;ale of &s;laves.</P>
<P>BUT let us &s;uppo&s;e all the&s;e moral difficulties got over. The ocean remains. You cannot pump this dry; and as long as it continues in its pre&s;ent bed, &s;o long all the cau&s;es which weaken authority by di&s;tance will continue.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Ye gods, annihilate but &s;pace and time, and make two lovers hap|py!"</Q>
&mdash;was a pious and pa&s;&s;ionate prayer;&mdash;but ju&s;t as rea&s;onable, as many of the &s;erious wi&s;hes of very grave and &s;olemn politicians.</P>
<P>IF then, &s;ir, it &s;eems almo&s;t de&s;perate to think of any alterative cour&s;e, for changing the moral cau&s;es (and not quite ea&s;y to remove the natural), which produce prejudices irreconcilable to the late exer|ci&s;e of our authority; but that the &s;pirit infallibly will continue; and, continuing, will produce &s;uch
<PB N="393" REF="389">
effects, as now embarra&s;s us; the &s;econd mode un|der con&s;ideration is, to pro&s;ecute that &s;pirit in its overt acts, as <HI>criminal.</HI></P>
<P>AT this propo&s;ition, I mu&s;t pau&s;e a moment. The thing &s;eems a great deal too big for my ideas of juri&s;prudence. It &s;hould &s;eem, to my way of conceiving &s;uch matters, that there is a very wide difference in rea&s;on and policy, between the mode of proceeding on the irregular conduct of &s;cattered individuals, or even of bands of men, who di&s;turb order within the &s;tate, and the civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions which may, from time to time, on great que&s;tions, agitate the &s;everal communities which compo&s;e a great empire. It looks to me to be narrow and pe|dantic, to apply the ordinary ideas of criminal ju&s;tice to this great public conte&s;t. I do not know the method of drawing up an indictment again&s;t an whole people. I cannot in&s;ult and ridicule the feelings of millions of my fellow-creatures, as &s;ir Edward Coke in&s;ulted one excellent individual (Sir Walter Rawleigh) at the bar. I am not ripe to pa&s;s &s;entence on the grave&s;t public bodies, entru&s;t|ed with magi&s;tracies of great authority and dignity, and charged with the &s;afety of their fellow-citizens, upon the very &s;ame title that I am. I really think, that for wi&s;e men, this is not judicious; for &s;ober men, not decent; for minds tinctured with huma|nity, not mild and merciful.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, &s;ir, I am mi&s;taken in my idea of an empire, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from a &s;ingle &s;tate or kingdom. But my idea of it is this; that an em|pire is the aggregate of many &s;tates, under one common head; whether this head be a monarch, or a pre&s;iding republic. It does, in &s;uch con&s;titu|tions, frequently happen (and nothing but the di&s;|mal, cold, dead uniformity of &s;ervitude can pre|vent its happening) that the &s;ubordinate parts have
<PB N="394" REF="390">
many local privileges and immunities. Between the&s;e privileges, and the &s;upreme common autho|rity, the line may be extremely nice. Of cour&s;e di&s;putes, often too, very bitter di&s;putes, and much ill blood, will ari&s;e. But though every privilege is an exemption (in the ca&s;e) from the ordinary ex|erci&s;e of the &s;upreme authority, it is no denial of it. The claim of a privilege &s;eems rather, <HI>ex vi termini,</HI> to imply a &s;uperior power. For to talk of the pri|vileges of a &s;tate or of a per&s;on, who has no &s;u|perior, is hardly any better than &s;peaking non|&s;en&s;e. Now, in &s;uch unfortunate quarrels, among the component parts of a great political union of communities, I can &s;carcely conceive any thing more compleatly imprudent, than for the head of the empire to in&s;i&s;t, that, if any privilege is pleaded again&s;t his will, or his acts, that his whole authority is denied; in&s;tantly to proclaim rebellion, to beat to arms, and to put the offending provinces under the ban. Will not this, &s;ir, very &s;oon teach the provinces to make no di&s;tinctions on their part? Will it not teach them that the government, again&s;t which a claim of liberty is tantamont to high-trea|&s;on, is a government to which &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is equi|valent to &s;lavery? It may not always be quite convenient to impre&s;s dependent communities with &s;uch an idea.</P>
<P>WE are, indeed, in all di&s;putes with the colo|nies, by the nece&s;&s;ity of things, the judge. It is true, &s;ir. But, I confe&s;s, that the character of judge in my own cau&s;e, is a thing that frightens me. In&s;tead of filling me with pride, I am ex|ceedingly humbled by it. I cannot proceed with a &s;tern, a&s;&s;ured, judicial confidence, until I find my&s;elf in &s;omething more like a judicial character. I mu&s;t have the&s;e he&s;itations as long as I am com|pelled to recollect, that, in my little reading upon
<PB N="395" REF="391">
&s;uch conte&s;ts as the&s;e, the &s;en&s;e of mankind has, at lea&s;t, as often decided again&s;t the &s;uperior as the &s;ubordinate power. Sir, let me add too, that the opinion of my having &s;ome ab&s;tract right in my favour, would not put me much at my ea&s;e in pa&s;&s;ing &s;entence; unle&s;s I could be &s;ure, that there were no rights which, in their exerci&s;e under cer|tain circum&s;tances, were not the mo&s;t odious of all wrongs, and the mo&s;t vexatious of all inju&s;tice. Sir, the&s;e con&s;iderations have great weight with me, when I find things &s;o circum&s;tanced; that I &s;ee the &s;ame party, at once a civil litigant again&s;t me in a point of right; and a culprit before me, while I &s;it as a criminal judge, on acts of his, who&s;e moral quality is to be decided upon the merits of that very litigation. Men are every now and then put, by the complexity of human affairs, into &s;trange &s;ituations; but ju&s;tice is the &s;ame, let the judge be in what &s;ituation he will.</P>
<P>THERE is, &s;ir, al&s;o a circum&s;tance which con|vinces me, that this mode of criminal proceeding is not (at lea&s;t in the pre&s;ent &s;tage of our conte&s;t) altogether expedient; which is nothing le&s;s than the conduct of tho&s;e very per&s;ons who have &s;eemed to adopt that mode, by lately declaring a rebellion in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay, as they had formerly addre&s;&s;|ed to have traitors brought hither under an act of Henry the eighth, for trial. For though rebellion is declared, it is not proceeded again&s;t as &s;uch; nor have any &s;teps been taken towards the appre|hen&s;ion or conviction of any individual offender, either on our late or our former addre&s;s; but modes of public coercion have been adopted, and &s;uch as have much more re&s;emblance to a &s;ort of qualified ho&s;tility towards an independant power than the pu|ni&s;hment of rebellious &s;ubjects. All this &s;eems ra|ther
<PB N="396" REF="392">
incon&s;i&s;tent; but it &s;hews how difficult it is to apply the&s;e juridical ideas to our pre&s;ent ca&s;e.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation, let us &s;eriou&s;ly and coolly pon|der. What is it we have got by all our menaces, which have been many and ferocious? What ad|vantage have we derived from the penal laws we have pa&s;&s;ed, and which, for the time, have been &s;evere and numerous? What advances have we made towards our object, by the &s;ending of a force, which, by land and &s;ea, is no contemptible &s;trength? Has the di&s;order abated? Nothing le&s;s.&mdash;When I &s;ee things in this &s;ituation, after &s;uch confi|dent hopes, bold promi&s;es, and active exertions, I cannot, for my life, avoid a &s;u&s;picion, that the plan it&s;elf is not correctly right.</P>
<P>IF then the removal of the cau&s;es of this &s;pirit of American liberty be, for the greater part, or rather entirely, impracticable; if the ideas of cri|minal proce&s;s be inapplicable, or, if applicable, are in the highe&s;t degree inexpedient, what way yet remains? No way is open, but the third and la&s;t&mdash;to comply with the American &s;pirit as ne|ce&s;&s;ary; or, if you plea&s;e, to &s;ubmit to it, as a ne|ce&s;&s;ary evil.</P>
<P>IF we adopt this mode; if we mean to conci|liate and concede; let us &s;ee of what nature the conce&s;&s;ion ought to be? To a&s;certain the nature of our conce&s;&s;ion, we mu&s;t look at their complaint. The colonies complain, that they have not the characteri&s;tic mark and &s;eal of Briti&s;h freedom. They complain, that they are taxed in a parlia|ment, in which they are not repre&s;ented. If you mean to &s;atisfy them at all, you mu&s;t &s;atisfy them with regard to this complaint. If you mean to plea&s;e any people, you mu&s;t give them the boon which they a&s;k; not what you may think better
<PB N="397" REF="393">
for them, but of a kind totally different. Such an act may be a wi&s;e regulation, but it is no con|ce&s;&s;ion: whereas our pre&s;ent theme is the mode of giving &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>SIR, I think you mu&s;t perceive, that I am re|&s;olved this day to have nothing at all to do with the que&s;tion of the right of taxation. Some gen|tlemen &s;tartle&mdash;but it is true: I put it totally out of the que&s;tion. It is le&s;s than nothing in my con|&s;ideration. I do not indeed wonder, nor will you, &s;ir, that gentlemen of profound learning are fond of di&s;playing it on this profound &s;ubject. But my con&s;ideration is narrow, confined, and wholly li|mited to the policy of the que&s;tion. I do not exa|mine, whether the giving away a man's money be a power excepted and re&s;erved out of the general tru&s;t of government; and how far all mankind, in all forms of polity, are intitled to an exerci&s;e of that right by the charter of nature. Or whether, on the contrary, a right of taxation is nece&s;&s;arily involved in the general principle of legi&s;lation, and in&s;eparable from the ordinary &s;upreme power? The&s;e are deep que&s;tions, where great names mili|tate again&s;t each other; where rea&s;on is perplexed; and an appeal to authorities only thickens the con|fu&s;ion. For high and reverend authorities lift up their heads on both &s;ides; and there is no &s;ure footing in the middle. This point is the <HI>great Serbonian bog, betwixt Damiata and mount Ca&s;ius old, where armies whole have &s;unk.</HI> I do not intend to be overwhelmed in that bog, though in &s;uch re|&s;pectable company. The que&s;tion with me is, not whether you have a right to render your people mi&s;erable; but whether it is not your intere&s;t to make them happy? It is not, what a lawyer tells me, I <HI>may</HI> do; but what humanity, rea&s;on, and ju&s;tice, tell me, I ought to do. Is a politic act
<PB N="398" REF="394">
the wor&s;e for being a generous one? Is no conce&s;|&s;ion proper, but that which is made from your want of right to keep what you grant? Or does it le&s;&s;en the grace or dignity of relaxing in the exer|ci&s;e of an odious claim, becau&s;e you have your evidence-room full of titles, and your magazines &s;tuffed with arms to enforce them? What &s;ignify all tho&s;e titles, and all tho&s;e arms? Of what avail are they, when the rea&s;on of the thing tells me, that the a&s;&s;ertion of my title is the lo&s;s of my &s;uit; and that I could do nothing but wound my&s;elf by the u&s;e of my own weapons?</P>
<P>SUCH is &s;tedfa&s;tly my opinion of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up the concord of this empire by a unity of &s;pirit, though in a diver&s;ity of ope|rations, that, if I were &s;ure the coloni&s;ts had, at their leaving this country, &s;ealed a regular compact of &s;ervitude; that they had &s;olemnly abjured all the rights of citizens; that they had made a vow to renounce all ideas of liberty for them and their po&s;terity, to all generations; yet I &s;hould hold my&s;elf obliged to conform to the temper I found univer&s;ally prevalent in my own day, and to go|vern two million of me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, impatient of &s;ervitude, on the principles of freedom. I am not determin|ing a point of law; I am re&s;toring tranquillity; and the general character and &s;ituation of a people mu&s;t determine what &s;ort of government is fitted for them. That point nothing el&s;e can or ought to determine.</P>
<P>MY idea therefore, without con&s;idering whether we yield as matter of right, or grant as matter of favour, is <HI>to admit the people of our colonies into an in|tere&s;t in the con&s;titution</HI>; and, by recording that ad|mi&s;&s;ion in the journals of parliament, to give them as &s;trong an a&s;&s;urance as the nature of the thing
<PB N="399" REF="395">
will admit, that we mean for ever to adhere to that &s;olemn declaration of &s;y&s;tematic indulgence.</P>
<P>SOME years ago, the repeal of a revenue act, upon its under&s;tood principle, might have &s;erved to &s;hew, that we intended an unconditional abate|ment of the exerci&s;e of a taxing power. Such a mea&s;ure was then &s;ufficient to remove all &s;u&s;picion; and to give perfect content. But unfortunate events, &s;ince that time, may make &s;omething fur|ther nece&s;&s;ary; and not more nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;a|tisfaction of the colonies, than for the dignity and con&s;i&s;tency of our own future proceedings.</P>
<P>I HAVE taken a very incorrect mea&s;ure of the di&s;po&s;ition of the hou&s;e, if this propo&s;al in it&s;elf would be received with di&s;like. I think, &s;ir, we have few American financiers. But our misfortune is, we are too acute; we are too exqui&s;ite in our conjectures of the future, for men oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch great and pre&s;ent evils. The more moderate among the oppo&s;ers of parliamentary conce&s;&s;ion freely confe&s;s, that they hope no good from taxa|tion; but they apprehend the coloni&s;ts have further views; and if this point were conceded, they would in&s;tantly attack the trade-laws. The&s;e gen|tlemen are convinced, that this was the intention from the beginning; and the quarrel of the Ame|ricans with taxation was no more than a cloke and cover to this de&s;ign. Such has been the language even of a <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Mr. Rice.</NOTE> gentleman of real moderation, and of a natural temper well adju&s;ted to fair and equal government. I am, however, &s;ir, not a little &s;ur|prized at this kind of di&s;cour&s;e, whenever I hear it; and I am the more &s;urprized, on account of the arguments which I con&s;tantly find in company
<PB N="400" REF="396">
with it, and which are often urged from the &s;ame mouths, and on the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>FOR in&s;tance, when we allege, that it is again&s;t rea&s;on to tax a people under &s;o many re&s;traints in trade as the Americans, the <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> noble lord in the blue ribband &s;hall tell you, that the re&s;traints on trade are futile and u&s;ele&s;s; of no advantage to us, and of no burthen to tho&s;e on whom they are impo&s;ed; that the trade to America is not &s;ecured by the acts of navigation, but by the natural and irre&s;i&s;tible ad|vantage of a commercial preference.</P>
<P>SUCH is the merit of the trade laws in this po&s;|ture of the debate. But when &s;trong internal cir|cum&s;tances are urged again&s;t the taxes; when the &s;cheme is di&s;&s;ected; when experience and the na|ture of things are brought to prove, and do prove, the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of obtaining an effective re|venue from the colonies; when the&s;e things are pre&s;&s;ed, or rather pre&s;s them&s;elves, &s;o as to drive the advocates of colony taxes to a clear admi&s;&s;ion of the futility of the &s;cheme; then, &s;ir, the &s;leep|ing trade laws revive from their trance; and this u&s;ele&s;s taxation is to be kept &s;acred, not for its own &s;ake, but as a counterguard and &s;ecurity of the laws of trade.</P>
<P>THEN, &s;ir, you keep up revenue laws which are mi&s;chievous, in order to pre&s;erve trade laws that are u&s;ele&s;s. Such is the wi&s;dom of our plan in both its members. They are &s;eparately given up as of no value; and yet one is always to be de|fended for the &s;ake of the other. But I cannot agree with the noble lord, nor with the pamphlet from whence he &s;eems to have borrowed the&s;e ideas, concerning the inutility of the trade laws. For without idolizing them, I am &s;ure they are &s;till, in
<PB N="401" REF="397">
many ways, of great u&s;e to us; and in former times, they have been of the greate&s;t. They do confine, and they do greatly narrow, the market for the Americans. But my perfect conviction of this, does not help me in the lea&s;t to di&s;cern how the revenue laws form any &s;ecurity what&s;oever to the commercial regulations; or that the&s;e commer|cial regulations are the true ground of the quarrel; or, that the giving way in any one in&s;tance of au|thority, is to lo&s;e all that may remain unconceded.</P>
<P>ONE fact is clear and indi&s;putable. The public and avowed origin of this quarrel, was on taxation. This quarrel has indeed brought on new di&s;putes on new que&s;tions; but certainly the lea&s;t bitter, and the fewe&s;t of all, on the trade laws. To judge which of the two be the real radical cau&s;e of quar|rel, we have to &s;ee whether the commercial di&s;pute did, in order of time, precede the di&s;pute on tax|ation? There is not a &s;hadow of evidence for it. Next, to enable us to judge whether at this mo|ment a di&s;like to the trade laws be the real cau&s;e of quarrel, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to put the taxes out of the que&s;tion by a repeal. See how the Americans act in this po&s;ition, and then you will be able to di&s;cern correctly what is the true object of the controver&s;y, or whether any controver&s;y at all will remain? Unle&s;s you con&s;ent to remove this cau&s;e of difference, it is impo&s;&s;ible, with de|cency, to a&s;&s;ert that the di&s;pute is not upon what it is avowed to be. And I would, &s;ir, recommend to your &s;erious con&s;ideration, whether it be prudent to form a rule for puni&s;hing people, not on their own acts, but on your conjectures? Surely it is prepo&s;terous at the very be&s;t. It is not ju&s;tifying your anger, by their mi&s;conduct; but it is con|verting your ill-will into their delinquency.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="398">BUT the colonies will go further.&mdash;Alas! alas! when will this &s;peculating again&s;t fact and rea&s;on end? What will quiet the&s;e panic fears which we entertain of the ho&s;tile effect of a conciliatory conduct? Is it true, that no ca&s;e can exi&s;t, in which it is proper for the &s;overeign to accede to the de&s;ires of his di&s;contented &s;ubjects? Is there any thing pe|culiar in this ca&s;e, to make a rule for it&s;elf? Is all authority of cour&s;e lo&s;t, when it is not pu&s;hed to the extreme? Is it a certain maxim, that, the fewer cau&s;es of di&s;&s;atisfaction are left by government, the more the &s;ubject will be inclined to re&s;i&s;t and rebel?</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e objections being in fact no more than &s;u&s;picions, conjectures, divinations; formed in de|fiance of fact and experience; they did not, &s;ir, di&s;courage me from entertaining the idea of a con|ciliatory conce&s;&s;ion, founded on the principles which I have ju&s;t &s;tated.</P>
<P>IN forming a plan for this purpo&s;e, I endeavour|ed to put my&s;elf in that frame of mind, which was the mo&s;t natural, and the mo&s;t rea&s;onable; and which was certainly the mo&s;t probable means of &s;e|curing me from all error. I &s;et out with a perfect di&s;tru&s;t of my own abilities; a total renunciation of every &s;peculation of my own; and with a profound reverence for the wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors, who have left us the inheritance of &s;o happy a con&s;ti|tution, and &s;o flouri&s;hing an empire, and what is a thou&s;and times more valuable, the trea&s;ury of the maxims and principles which formed the one, and ebtained the other.</P>
<P>DURING the reigns of the kings of Spain of the Au&s;trian family, whenever they were at a lo&s;s in the Spani&s;h councils, it was common for their &s;tate&s;|men to &s;ay, that they ought to con&s;ult the genius
<PB N="403" REF="399">
of Philip the &s;econd. The genius of Philip the &s;e|cond might mi&s;lead them; and the i&s;&s;ue of their affairs &s;hewed, that they had not cho&s;en the mo&s;t perfect &s;tandard. But, &s;ir, I am &s;ure that I &s;hall not be mi&s;led, when, in a ca&s;e of con&s;titutional difficulty, I con&s;ult the genius of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution. Con&s;ulting at that oracle (it was with all due humility and piety) I found four capital ex|amples in a &s;imilar ca&s;e before me: tho&s;e of Ire|land, Wales, Che&s;ter, and Durham.</P>
<P>IRELAND, before the Engli&s;h conque&s;t, though never governed by a de&s;potic power, had no parli|ament. How far the Engli&s;h parliament it&s;elf was at that time modelled according to the pre&s;ent form, is di&s;puted among antiquarians. But we have all the rea&s;on in the world to be a&s;&s;ured, that a form of parliament, &s;uch as England then enjoy|ed, &s;he in&s;tantly communicated to Ireland; and we are equally &s;ure that almo&s;t every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive im|provement in con&s;titutional liberty, as fa&s;t as it was made here, was tran&s;mitted thither. The feudal baronage, and the feudal knighthood, the roots of our primitive con&s;titution, were early tran&s;planted into that &s;oil; and grew and flouri&s;hed there. Magna charta, if it did not give us originally the hou&s;e of commons, gave us at lea&s;t an hou&s;e of commons of weight and con&s;equence. But your ance&s;tors did not churli&s;hly &s;it down alone to the fea&s;t of magna charta. Ireland was made immedi|ately a partaker. This benefit of Engli&s;h laws and liberties, I confe&s;s, was not at fir&s;t extended to <HI>all</HI> Ireland. Mark the con&s;equence. Engli&s;h autho|rity and Engli&s;h liberties had exactly the &s;ame boundaries. Your &s;tandard could never be ad|vanced an inch before your privileges. Sir John Davis &s;hews beyond a doubt, that the refu&s;al of a general communication of the&s;e rights, was the true
<PB N="404" REF="400">
cau&s;e why Ireland was five hundred years in &s;ub|duing; and after the vain projects of a military go|vernment, attempted in the reign of queen Eliza|beth, it was &s;oon di&s;covered, that nothing could make that country Engli&s;h, in civility and allegi|ance, but your laws and your forms of legi&s;lature. It was not Engli&s;h arms, but the Engli&s;h con&s;titu|tion, that conquered Ireland. From that time, Ireland has ever had a general parliament, as &s;he had before a partial parliament. You changed the people; you altered the religion; but you never touched the form or the vital &s;ub&s;tance of free go|vernment in that kingdom. You depo&s;ed kings; you re&s;tored them; you altered the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to theirs, as well as to your own crown; but you ne|ver altered their con&s;titution; the principle of which was re&s;pected by u&s;urpation; re&s;tored with the re|&s;toration of monarchy, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, I tru&s;t, for ever, by the glorious revolution. This has made Ireland the great and flouri&s;hing kingdom that it is; and from a di&s;grace and a burthen intolerable to this nation, has rendered her a principal part of our &s;trength and ornament. This country cannot be &s;aid to have ever formally taxed her. The irregu|lar things done in the confu&s;ion of mighty troubles, and on the hinge of great revolutions, even if all were done that is &s;aid to have been done, form no example. If they have any effect in argument, they make an exception to prove the rule. None of your own liberties could &s;tand a moment, if the ca&s;ual deviations from them, at &s;uch times, were &s;uffered to be u&s;ed as proofs of their nullity. By the lucrative amount of &s;uch ca&s;ual breaches in the con&s;titution, judge what the &s;tated and fixed rule of &s;upply has been in that kingdom. Your Iri&s;h pen|&s;ioners would &s;tarve, if they had no other fund to live on than taxes granted by Engli&s;h authority. Turn your eyes to tho&s;e popular grants from whence
<PB N="405" REF="401">
all your great &s;upplies are come; and learn to re|&s;pect that only &s;ource of public wealth in the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>MY next example is Wales. This country was &s;aid to be reduced by Henry the third. It was &s;aid more truly to be &s;o by Edward the fir&s;t. But though then conquered, it was not looked upon as any part of the realm of England. Its old con&s;titution, whatever that might have been, was de&s;troyed; and no good one was &s;ub&s;tituted in its place. The care of that tract was put into the hands of lords marchers&mdash;a form of government of a very &s;ingu|lar kind; a &s;trange heterogeneous mon&s;ter, &s;ome|thing between ho&s;tility and government; perhaps it has a &s;ort of re&s;emblance, according to the modes of tho&s;e times, to that of commander in chief at pre&s;ent, to whom all civil power is granted as &s;e|condary. The manners of the Wel&s;h nation fol|lowed the genius of the government: The people were ferocious, re&s;tive, &s;avage, and uncultivated; &s;ometimes compo&s;ed, never pacified. Wales within it&s;elf, was in perpetual di&s;order; and it kept the frontier of England in perpetual alarm. Bene|fits from it to the &s;tate, there were none. Wales was only known to England, by incur&s;ion and in|va&s;ion.</P>
<P>SIR, during that &s;tate of things, parliament was not idle. They attempted to &s;ubdue the fierce &s;pirit of the Wel&s;h by all &s;orts of rigorous laws. They prohibited by &s;tatute the &s;ending all &s;orts of arms into Wales, as you prohibit by proclamation (with &s;omething more of doubt on the legality) the &s;ending arms to America. They di&s;armed the Wel&s;h by &s;tatute, as you attempted (but &s;till with more que&s;tion on the legality) to di&s;arm New Eng|land by an in&s;truction. They made an act to drag offenders from Wales into England for trial, as you
<PB N="406" REF="402">
have done (but with more hard&s;hip) with regard to America. By another act, where one of the parties was an Engli&s;hman, they ordained, that his trial &s;hould be always by Engli&s;h. They made acts to re&s;train trade, as you do; and they prevented the Wel&s;h from the u&s;e of fairs and markets, as you do the Americans from fi&s;heries and foreign ports. In &s;hort, when the &s;tatute-book was not quite &s;o much &s;welled as it is now, you find no le&s;s than fifteen acts of penal regulation on the &s;ubject of Wales.</P>
<P>HERE we rub our hands&mdash;A fine body of pre|cedents for the authority of parliament and the u&s;e of it!&mdash;I admit it fully; and pray add likewi&s;e to the&s;e precedents, that all the while, Wales rid this kingdom like an <HI>incubus</HI>; that it was an unprofit|able and oppre&s;&s;ive burthen; and that an Engli&s;h|man travelling in that country, could not go &s;ix yards from the high road without being murdered.</P>
<P>THE march of the human mind is &s;low. Sir, it was not, until after two hundred years, di&s;co|vered, that by an eternal law, Providence had de|creed vexation to violence; and poverty to rapine. Your ance&s;tors did however at length open their eyes to the ill hu&s;bandry of inju&s;tice. They found that the tyranny of a free people could of all tyran|nies the lea&s;t be endured; and that laws made again&s;t an whole nation were not the mo&s;t effectual methods for &s;ecuring its obedience. Accordingly, in the twenty-&s;eventh year of Henry VIII. the cour&s;e was entirely altered. With a preamble &s;tating the entire and perfect rights of the crown of England, it gave to the Wel&s;h all the rights and privileges of Engli&s;h &s;ubjects. A political order was e&s;tabli&s;hed; the military power gave way to the civil; the marches were turned into counties. But that a nation &s;hould have a right to Engli&s;h li|berties,
<PB N="407" REF="403">
and yet no &s;hare at all in the fundamental &s;ecurity of the&s;e liberties, the grant of their own property, &s;eemed a thing &s;o incongruous; that eight years after, that is, in the thirty-fifth of that reign, a complete and not ill proportioned repre|&s;entation by counties and boroughs was be&s;towed upon Wales, by act of parliament. From that moment, as by a charm, the tumults &s;ub&s;ided; obedience was re&s;tored; peace, order, and civili|zation, followed in the train of liberty&mdash;When the day-&s;tar of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution had ari&s;en in their hearts, all was harmony within and with|out&mdash;

<P>THE very &s;ame year the county palatine of Che&s;ter received the &s;ame relief from its oppre&s;&s;i|ons, and the &s;ame remedy to its di&s;orders. Before this time Che&s;ter was little le&s;s di&s;tempered than Wales. The inhabitants, without rights them&s;elves, were the fitte&s;t to de&s;troy the rights of others; and from thence Richard II. drew the &s;tanding army of archers, with which for a time he oppre&s;&s;ed Eng|land. The people of Che&s;ter applied to parliament in a petition penned as I &s;hall read to you:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline"><HI>TO the king our &s;overeign lord, in mo&s;t humble wi&s;e &s;hewn unto your excellent maje&s;ty, the inhabitants of your grace's county palatine of Che&s;ter, that where the &s;aid county palatine of Che&s;ter is and hath been always hitherto exempt, excluded and &s;eparated out and from your high court of parliament, to have any knights and burge&s;&s;es within the &s;aid court; by rea&s;on whereof the</HI>
<PB N="408" REF="404"><HI>&s;aid inhabitants have hitherto &s;u&s;tained manifold di&s;he|ri&s;ons, lo&s;&s;es and damages, as well in their lands, goods, and bodies, as in the good, civil, and politic governance and maintenance of the commonwealth of their &s;aid coun|try: (2.) And for as much as the &s;aid inhabitants have always hitherto been bound by the acts and &s;tatutes made and ordained by your &s;aid highne&s;s, and your mo&s;t noble progenitors, by authority of the &s;aid court, as far forth as other counties, cities, and boroughs have been, that have had their knights and burge&s;&s;es within your &s;aid court of parliament, and yet have had neither knight ne burge&s;s there for the &s;aid county palatine; the &s;aid inhabitants, for lack thereof, have been oftentimes touch|ed and grieved with acts and &s;tatutes made within the &s;aid court, as well derogatory unto the mo&s;t antient juri&s;|dictions, liberties, and privileges of your &s;aid county pala|tine, as prejudicial unto the common wealth, quietne&s;s, re&s;t, and peace of your grace's mo&s;t bounden &s;ubjects in|habiting within the &s;ame.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WHAT did parliament with this audacious ad|dre&s;s?&mdash;reject it as a libel? Treat it as an affront to government? Spurn it as a derogation from the rights of legi&s;lature? Did they to&s;s it over the ta|ble? Did they burn it by the hands of the common hangman?&mdash;They took the petition of grievance, all rugged as it was, without &s;oftening or tempera|ment, unpurged of the original bitterne&s;s and in|dignation of complaint; they made it the very pre|amble to their act of redre&s;s; and con&s;ecrated its principle to all ages in the &s;anctuary of legi&s;lation.</P>
<P>HERE is my third example. It was attended with the &s;ucce&s;s of the two former. Che&s;ter, civi|lized as well as Wales, has demon&s;trated that free|dom and not &s;ervitude is the cure of anarchy; as religion, and not athei&s;m, is the true remedy for &s;uper&s;tition. Sir, this pattern of Che&s;ter was fol|lowed in the reign of Charles II. with regard to the
<PB N="409" REF="405">
county palatine of Durham, which is my fourth ex|ample. This county had long lain out of the pale of free legi&s;lation. So &s;crupulou&s;ly was the example of Che&s;ter followed, that the &s;tyle of the preamble is nearly the &s;ame with that of the Che&s;ter act; and without affecting the ab&s;tract extent of the autho|rity of parliament, it recognizes the equity of not &s;uffering any con&s;iderable di&s;trict in which the Bri|ti&s;h &s;ubjects may act as a body, to be taxed without their own voice in the grant.</P>
<P>NOW if the doctrines of policy contained in the&s;e preambles, and the force of the&s;e examples in the acts of parliament, avail any thing, what can be &s;aid again&s;t applying them with regard to Ameri|ca? Are not the people of America as much Eng|li&s;hmen as the Wel&s;h? The preamble of the act of Henry VIII. &s;ays, the Wel&s;h &s;peak a language no way re&s;embling that of his maje&s;ty's Engli&s;h &s;ub|jects. Are the Americans not as numerous? If we may tru&s;t the learned and accurate judge Barring|ton's account of North Wales, and take that as a &s;tandard to mea&s;ure the re&s;t, there is no compari|&s;on. The people cannot amount to above 200,000; not a tenth part of the number in the colonies. Is America in rebellion? Wales was hardly ever free from it. Have you attempted to govern America by penal &s;tatutes? You made fifteen for Wales. But your legi&s;lative authority is perfect with regard to America; was it le&s;s perfect in Wales, Che&s;ter, and Durham? But America is virtually repre&s;ented. What! does the electric force of virtual repre&s;enta|tion more ea&s;ily pa&s;s over the Atlantic, than per|vade Wales, which lies in your neighbourhood; or than Che&s;ter and Durham, &s;urrounded by abun|dance of repre&s;entation that is actual and palpable? But, &s;ir, your ance&s;tors thought this &s;ort of virtual repre&s;entation, however ample, to be totally in|&s;ufficient
<PB N="410" REF="406">
for the freedom of the inhabitants of terri|tories that are &s;o near, and comparatively &s;o incon|&s;iderable. How then can I think it &s;ufficient for tho&s;e which are infinitely greater, and infinitely more remote?</P>
<P>YOU will now, &s;ir, perhaps imagine, that I am on the point of propo&s;ing to you a &s;cheme for a repre|&s;entation of the colonies in parliament. Perhaps I might be inclined to entertain &s;ome &s;uch thought; but a great flood &s;tops me in my cour&s;e. <HI>Oppo&s;uit natura</HI>&mdash;I cannot remove the eternal barriers of the creation. The thing in that mode, I do not know to be po&s;&s;ible. As I meddle with no theory, I do not ab&s;olutely a&s;&s;ert the impracticability of &s;uch a repre&s;entation. But I do not &s;ee my way to it; and tho&s;e who have been more confident, have not been more &s;ucce&s;sful. However, the arm of public be|nevolence is not &s;hortened; and there are often &s;e|veral means to the &s;ame end. What nature has dis|joined in one way, wi&s;dom may unite in another. When we cannot give the benefit as we would wi&s;h, let us not refu&s;e it altogether. If we cannot give the principal, let us find a &s;ub&s;titute. But how? Where? What &s;ub&s;titute?</P>
<P>FORTUNATELY I am not obliged for the ways and means of this &s;ub&s;titute to tax my own unpro|ductive invention. I am not even obliged to go to the rich trea&s;ury of the fertile framers of imagin|ary commonwealths; not to the republic of Plato, not to the Utopia of More; not to the Oceana of Harrington. It is before me&mdash;It is at my feet, <HI>and the rude &s;wain treads daily on it with his clouted &s;hoon.</HI> I only wi&s;h you to recognize, for the theory, the ancient con&s;titutional policy of this kingdom with regard to repre&s;entation, as that policy has been de|clared in acts of parliament; and, as to the prac|tice, to return to that mode which an uniform ex|perience
<PB N="411" REF="407">
has marked out to you, as be&s;t; and in which you walked with &s;ecurity, advantage, and honour, until the year 1763.</P>
<P>MY re&s;olutions therefore mean to e&s;tabli&s;h the equity and ju&s;tice of a taxation of America, by <HI>grant,</HI> and not by <HI>impo&s;ition.</HI> To mark the <HI>legal competency</HI> of the colony a&s;&s;emblies for the &s;upport of their government in peace, and for public aids in time of war. To acknowledge that this legal competency has had <HI>a dutiful and beneficial exerci&s;e</HI>; and that experience has &s;hewn the <HI>benefit of their grants,</HI> and the <HI>futility of parliamentary taxation as a method of &s;upply.</HI></P>
<P>THESE &s;olid truths compo&s;e &s;ix fundamental pro|po&s;itions. There are three more re&s;olutions corol|lary to the&s;e. If you admit the fir&s;t &s;et, you can hardly reject the others. But if you admit the fir&s;t, I &s;hall be far from &s;olicitous whether you accept or refu&s;e the la&s;t. I think the&s;e &s;ix ma&s;&s;ive pillars will be of &s;trength &s;ufficient to &s;upport the temple of Briti&s;h concord. I have no more doubt than I en|tertain of my exi&s;tence, that, if you admitted the&s;e, you would command an immediate peace; and with but tolerable future management, a la&s;ting obedience in America. I am not arrogant in this confident a&s;&s;urance. The propo&s;itions are all mere matters of fact; and if they are &s;uch facts as draw irre&s;i&s;tible conclu&s;ions even in the &s;tating, this is the power of truth, and not any management of mine.</P>
<P>SIR, I &s;hall open the whole plan to you together, with &s;uch ob&s;ervations on the motions as may tend to illu&s;trate them where they may want explana|tion. The fir&s;t is a re&s;olution&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That the colonies and plantations of Great Britain in North America, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen &s;eparate governments, and con|taining two millions and upwards of free inhabitants,</HI>
<PB N="412" REF="408">
<HI>have not had the liberty and privilege of electing and &s;ending any knights and burge&s;&s;es, or others to repre|&s;ent them in the high court of parliament.</HI>"</Q>
&mdash;This is a plain matter of fact, nece&s;&s;ary to be laid down, and (excepting the de&s;cription) it is laid down in the language of the con&s;titution; it is taken nearly <HI>verbatim</HI> from acts of parliament.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd is like unto the fir&s;t&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That the &s;aid colonies and plantations have been liable to, and boun|den by, &s;everal &s;ub&s;idies, payments, rates, and taxes, given and granted by parliament, though the &s;aid colo|nies and plantations have not their knights and bur|ge&s;&s;es, in the &s;aid high court of parliament, of their own election, to repre&s;ent the condition of their coun|try; by lack whereof they have been oftentimes touch|ed and grieved by &s;ub&s;idies given, granted, and a&s;&s;ent|ed to, in the &s;aid court, in a manner prejudicial to the common wealth, quietne&s;s, re&s;t, and peace of the &s;ub|jects inhabiting within the &s;ame.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>IS this de&s;cription too hot, or too cold, too &s;trong, or too weak? Does it arrogate too much to the &s;u|preme legi&s;lature? Does it lean too much to the claims of the people? If it runs into any of the&s;e errors, the fault is not mine. It is the language of your own ancient acts of parliament. <HI>Non meus hic &s;ermo, &s;ed quae praecepit Ofellus, ru&s;ticus, abnormis &s;apiens.</HI> It is the genuine produce of the ancient ru&s;tic, manly, home-bred &s;en&s;e of this country&mdash;I did not dare to rub off a particle of the venerable ru&s;t that rather adorns and pre&s;erves, than de&s;troys the metal. It would be a profanation to touch with a tool the &s;tones which con&s;truct the &s;acred altar of peace. I would not violate with modern poli&s;h the ingenuous and noble roughne&s;s of the&s;e truly con&s;titutional materials. Above all things, I was re&s;olved not to be guilty of tampering, the odi|ous vice of re&s;tle&s;s and un&s;table minds. I put my
<PB N="413" REF="409">
foot in the tracks of our forefathers; where I can neither wander nor &s;tumble. Determining to fix articles of peace, I was re&s;olved not to be wi&s;e be|yond what was written; I was re&s;olved to u&s;e no|thing el&s;e than the form of &s;ound words; to let others abound in their own &s;en&s;e; and carefully to ab&s;tain from all expre&s;&s;ions of my own. What the law has &s;aid, I &s;ay. In all things el&s;e I am &s;ilent. I have no organ but for her words. This, if it be not in|genious, I am &s;ure is &s;afe.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed words expre&s;&s;ive of grievance in this &s;econd re&s;olution, which tho&s;e who are re|&s;olved always to be in the right, will deny to contain matter of fact, as applied to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; al|though parliament thought them true, with regard to the counties of Che&s;ter and Durham. They will deny that the Americans were ever
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"touched and griev|ed"</Q>
with the taxes. If they con&s;ider nothing in taxes but their weight as pecuniary impo&s;itions, there might be &s;ome pretence for this denial. But men may be &s;orely touched and deeply grieved in their privileges, as well as in their pur&s;es. Men may lo&s;e little in property by the act which takes away all their freedom. When a man is robbed of a trifle on the highway, it is not the two-pence lo&s;t that con&s;titutes the capital outrage. This is not con|fined to privileges. Even ancient indulgencies with|drawn, without offence on the part of tho&s;e who en|joyed &s;uch favours, operate as grievances. But were the Americans then not touched and grieved by the taxes, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, merely as taxes? If &s;o, why were they almo&s;t all, either wholly repealed or exceedingly reduced? Were they not touched and grieved, even by the regulating duties of the &s;ixth of George II? El&s;e why were the duties fir&s;t reduced to one third in 1764, and afterwards to a third of that third in the year 1766? Were they

<P>SIR, here is the repeated acknowledgment of parliament, that the colonies not only gave, but gave to &s;atiety. This nation has formally acknow|ledged two things; fir&s;t, that the colonies had gone beyond their abilities, parliament having thought it nece&s;&s;ary to reimbur&s;e them; &s;econdly, that they had acted legally and laudably in their grants of money, and their maintenance of troops, &s;ince the compen&s;ation is expre&s;sly given as reward and en|couragement. Reward is not be&s;towed for acts that are unlawful; and encouragement is not held out to things that de&s;erve reprehen&s;ion. My re&s;olution therefore does nothing more than collect into one propo&s;ition, what is &s;cattered through your journals. I give you nothing but your own; and you cannot refu&s;e in the gro&s;s, what you have &s;o often acknow|leged in detail. The admi&s;&s;ion of this, which will be &s;o honourable to them and to you, will, indeed, be mortal to all the mi&s;erable &s;tories, by which the pa&s;&s;ions of the mi&s;guided people have been engaged in an unhappy &s;y&s;tem. The people heard, indeed, from the beginning of the&s;e di&s;putes, one thing con|tinually dinned in their ears, that rea&s;on and ju&s;tice demanded, that the Americans, who paid no taxes; &s;hould be compelled to contribute. How did that fact of their paying nothing, &s;tand, when the taxing &s;y&s;tem began? When Mr. Grenville began to form his &s;y&s;tem of American revenue, he &s;tated in this hou&s;e, that the colonies were then in debt two mil|lions
<PB N="418" REF="414">
&s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling money; and was of opinion they would di&s;charge that debt in four years. On this &s;tate, tho&s;e untaxed people were actually &s;ubject to the payment of taxes to the amount of &s;ix hundred and fifty thou&s;and a year. In fact, however, Mr. Grenville was mi&s;taken. The funds given for &s;inking the debt did not prove quite &s;o ample as both the colonies and he expected. The calculation was too &s;anguine: the reduction was not compleated till &s;ome years after, and at dif|ferent times in different colonies. However, the taxes after the war, continued too great to bear any addition, with prudence or propriety; and when the burthens impo&s;ed in con&s;equence of former re|qui&s;itions were di&s;charged, our tone became too high to re&s;ort again to requi&s;ition. No colony, &s;ince that time, ever has had any requi&s;ition what&s;oever made to it.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee the &s;en&s;e of the crown, and the &s;en&s;e of parliament, on the productive nature of a <HI>revenue by grant.</HI> Now, &s;earch the &s;ame journals for the pro|duce of the <HI>revenue by impo&s;ition.</HI>&mdash;Where is it?&mdash;let us know the volume and the page?&mdash;what is the gro&s;s, what is the nett produce?&mdash;to what &s;ervice is it applied?&mdash;how have you appropriated its &s;urplus?&mdash;What, can none of the many &s;kilful index-ma|kers, that we are now employing, find any trace of it?&mdash;Well, let them and that re&s;t together.&mdash;But are the journals, which &s;ay nothing of the revenue, as &s;ilent on the di&s;content?&mdash;Oh no! a child may find it. It is the melancholy burthen and blot of every page.</P>
<P>I THINK then I am, from tho&s;e journals, ju&s;tified in the &s;ixth and la&s;t re&s;olution, which is&mdash;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That it hath been found by experience, that the manner of granting the &s;aid &s;upplies and aids, by the &s;aid gene|ral a&s;&s;emblies, hath been more agreeable to the &s;aid co|lonies, and more beneficial, and conducive to the public</HI>
<PB N="419" REF="415"><HI>&s;ervice, than the mode of giving and granting aids in parliament, to be rai&s;ed and paid in the &s;aid colonies.</HI>"</Q>
This makes the whole of the fundamental part of the plan. The conclu&s;ion is irre&s;i&s;tible. You cannot &s;ay, that you were driven by any nece&s;&s;ity, to an ex|erci&s;e of the utmo&s;t rights of legi&s;lature. You cannot a&s;&s;ert, that you took on your&s;elves the ta&s;k of im|po&s;ing colony taxes, from the want of another legal body, that is competent to the purpo&s;e of &s;upplying the exigencies of the &s;tate without wounding the prejudices of the people. Neither is it true that the body &s;o qualified, and having that competence, had neglected the duty.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion now, on all this accumulated mat|ter, is;&mdash;whether you will chu&s;e to abide by a pro|fitable experience, or a mi&s;chievous theory; whe|ther you chu&s;e to build on imagination or fact; whe|ther you prefer enjoyment or hope; &s;atisfaction in your &s;ubjects, or di&s;content?</P>
<P>IF the&s;e propo&s;itions are accepted, every thing which has been made to enforce a contrary &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t, I take it for granted, fall along with it. On that ground, I have drawn the following re&s;olution, which, when it comes to be moved, will naturally be divided in a proper manner: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That it may be proper to repeal an act, made in the &s;eventh year of the reign of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, intituled, An act for granting certain duties in the Briti&s;h colonies and plantations in America; for allowing a drawback of the duties of cu&s;toms upon the exportation from this kingdom, of coffee and cocoa-nuts of the produce of the &s;aid colonies or plantations; for di&s;continuing the draw|backs payable on China earthen-ware exported to A|merica; and for more effectually preventing the clan-de&s;tine running of goods in the &s;aid colonies and plan|tations.&mdash;And that it may be proper to repeal an act, made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, intituled, An act to di&s;continue in &s;uch manner,</HI>
<PB N="420" REF="416">
<HI>and for &s;uch time, as are therein mentioned, the land|ing and di&s;charging, lading or &s;hipping, of goods, wares, and merchandize, at the town and within the harbour of Bo&s;ton, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay, in North America.&mdash;And that it may be proper to repeal an act, made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, intituled, An act for the impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, in the ca&s;es of per|&s;ons que&s;tioned for any acts done by them, in the execu|tion of the law, or for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of riots and tu|mults, in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's Bay in New England.&mdash;And that it may be proper to repeal an act, made in the fourteenth year of the reign of his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, intituled, An act for the better regu|lating the government of the province of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;et's Bay in New England.&mdash;And al&s;o that it may be proper to explain and amend an act, made in the thirty-fifth year of the reign of king Henry the eighth, intituled, An act for the trial of trea&s;ons committed out of the king's dominions.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I WISH, &s;ir, to repeal the Bo&s;ton port bill, be|cau&s;e (independently of the dangerous precedent of &s;u&s;pending the rights of the &s;ubject during the king's plea&s;ure) it was pa&s;&s;ed, as I apprehend, with le&s;s regularity, and on more partial principles, than it ought. The corporation of Bo&s;ton was not heard, before it was condemned. Other towns, full as guilty as &s;he was, have not had their ports blocked up. Even the re&s;training bill of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion does not go to the length of the Bo&s;ton port act. The &s;ame ideas of prudence, which induced you not to extend equal puni&s;hment to equal guilt, even when you were puni&s;hing, induce me, who mean not to cha&s;ti&s;e, but to reconcile, to be &s;atisfied with the puni&s;hment already partially inflicted.</P>
<P>IDEAS of prudence, and accomodation to cir|cum&s;tances, prevent you from taking away the
<PB N="421" REF="417">
charters of Connecticut and Rhode-i&s;land, as you have taken away that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's colony, though the crown has far le&s;s power in the two for|mer provinces than it enjoyed in the latter; and though the abu&s;es have been full as great, and as flagrant, in the exempted as in the puni&s;hed. The &s;ame rea&s;ons of prudence and accommodation have weight with me in re&s;toring the charter of Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;et's Bay. Be&s;ides, &s;ir, the act which changes the charter of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's is in many particulars &s;o exceptionable, that, if I did not wi&s;h ab&s;olutely to repeal, I would by all means de&s;ire to alter it; as &s;everal of its provi&s;ions tend to the &s;ubver&s;ion of all public and private ju&s;tice. Such, among others, is the power in the governor to change the &s;heriff at his plea&s;ure; and to make a new returning officer for every &s;pecial cau&s;e. It is &s;hameful to behold &s;uch a regulation &s;tanding among Engli&s;h laws.</P>
<P>THE act for bringing per&s;ons accu&s;ed of com|mitting murder under the orders of government to England for trial, is but temporary. That act has calculated the probable duration of our quarrel with the colonies; and is accommodated to that &s;uppo&s;|ed duration. I would ha&s;ten the happy moment of reconciliation; and therefore mu&s;t, on my principle, get rid of that mo&s;t ju&s;tly obnoxious act.</P>
<P>THE act of Henry the eighth, for the trial of trea|&s;ons, I do not mean to take away, but to confine it to its proper bounds and original intention; to make it expre&s;sly for trial of trea&s;ons (and the great|e&s;t trea&s;ons may be committed) in places where the juri&s;diction of the crown does not extend.</P>
<P>HAVING guarded the privileges of local legi&s;la|ture, I would next &s;ecure to the colonies a fair and unbia&s;&s;ed judicature; for which purpo&s;e, &s;ir, I pro|po&s;e the following re&s;olution:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That, from the time</HI>
<PB N="422" REF="418">
<HI>when the general a&s;&s;embly or general court of any co|lony or plantation in North America, &s;hall have ap|pointed by act of a&s;&s;embly, duly confirmed, a &s;ettled &s;alary to the offices of the chief ju&s;tice and other judges of the &s;uperior court, it may be proper, that the &s;aid chief ju&s;tice and other judges of the &s;uperior courts of &s;uch colony, &s;hall hold his and their office and offices during their good behaviour; and &s;hall not be removed therefrom, but when the &s;aid removal &s;hall be adjudged by his maje&s;ty in council, upon a hearing on complaint from the general a&s;&s;embly, or on a complaint from the governor, or council, or the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives &s;everally, of the colony in which the &s;aid chief ju&s;tice and other judges have exerci&s;ed the &s;aid offices.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>THE next re&s;olution relates to the courts of ad|miralty.</P>
<P>IT is this.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>That it may be proper to regulate the courts of admiralty, or vice admiralty, authorized by the 15th chap. of the 4th of George the third, in &s;uch a manner as to make the &s;ame more commodious to tho&s;e who &s;ue, or are &s;ued, in the &s;aid courts, and to provide for the more decent maintenance of the judges in the &s;ame.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>THESE courts I do not wi&s;h to take away; they are in them&s;elves proper e&s;tabli&s;hments. This court is one of the capital &s;ecurities of the act of naviga|tion. The extent of its juri&s;diction, indeed, has been encrea&s;ed; but this is altogether as proper, and is, indeed, on many accounts, more eligible, where new powers were wanted, than a court ab&s;o|lutely new. But courts incommodiou&s;ly &s;ituated, in effect, deny ju&s;tice;<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The &s;olicitor-general informed Mr. B. when the re&s;olutions were &s;eparately moved, that the grievance of the judges par|taking of the profits of the &s;eizure had been redre&s;&s;ed by office; accordingly the re&s;olution was amended.</NOTE> and a court, partaking in
<PB N="423" REF="419">
the fruits of its own condemnation, is a robber. The congre&s;s complain, and complain ju&s;tly, of this grievance.</P>
<P>THESE are the three con&s;equential propo&s;itions. I have thought of two or three more; but they come rather too near detail, and to the province of execu|tive government, which I wi&s;h parliament always to &s;uperintend, never to a&s;&s;ume. If the fir&s;t &s;ix are granted, congruity will carry the latter three. If not, the things that remain unrepealed, will be, I hope, rather un&s;eemly incumbrances on the building, than very materially detrimental to its &s;trength and &s;ta|bility.</P>
<P>HERE, &s;ir, I &s;hould clo&s;e; but that I plainly per|ceive &s;ome objections remain, which, I ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to remove. The fir&s;t will be, that, in re|&s;orting to the doctrine of our ance&s;tors, as contained in the preamble to the Che&s;ter act, I prove too much; that the grievance from a want of repre&s;en|tation, &s;tated in that preamble, goes to the whole of legi&s;lation as well as to taxation. And that the co|lonies grounding them&s;elves upon that doctrine, will apply it to all parts of legi&s;lative authority.</P>
<P>TO this objection, with all po&s;&s;ible deference and humility, and wi&s;hing as little as any man living to impair the &s;malle&s;t particle of our &s;upreme authority, I an&s;wer, that <HI>the words are the words of parliament, and not mine</HI>; and, that all fal&s;e and inconclu&s;ive in|ferences, drawn from them, are not mine; for I heartily di&s;claim any &s;uch inference. I have cho&s;en the words of an act of parliament, which Mr. Gren|ville, &s;urely a tolerably zealous and very judicious advocate for the &s;overeignty of parliament, formerly moved to have read at your table, in confirmation of his tenets. It is true that lord Chatham con&s;ider|ed the&s;e preambles as declaring &s;trongly in favour
<PB N="424" REF="420">
of his opinions. He was a no le&s;s powerful advo|cate for the privileges of the Americans. Ought I not from hence to pre&s;ume, that the&s;e preambles are as favourable as po&s;&s;ible to both, when properly un|der&s;tood; favourable both to the rights of parlia|ment, and to the privilege of the dependencies of this crown? But, &s;ir, the object of grievance in my re&s;olution, I have not taken from the Che&s;ter, but from the Durham act, which confines the hard&s;hip of want of repre&s;entation, to the ca&s;e of &s;ub&s;idies; and which therefore falls in exactly with the ca&s;e of the colonies. But whether the unrepre&s;ented coun|ties were <HI>de jure,</HI> or <HI>de facto,</HI> bound, the preambles do not accurately di&s;tingui&s;h; nor indeed was it ne|ce&s;&s;ary; for, whether <HI>de jure,</HI> or <HI>de facto,</HI> the legi&s;la|ture thought the exerci&s;e of the power of taxing, as of right, or as of fact without right, equally a griev|ance and equally oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>I DO not know, that the colonies have, in any ge|ral way, or in any cool hour, gone much beyond the demand of immunity in relation to taxes. It is not fair to judge of the temper or di&s;po&s;itions of any man, or any &s;et of men, when they are compo&s;|ed and at re&s;t, from their conduct, or their expre&s;|&s;ions, in a &s;tate of di&s;turbance and irritation. It is be&s;ides a very great mi&s;take to imagine, that man|kind follow up practically any &s;peculative principle, either of government or of freedom, as far as it will go in argument and logical illation. We Engli&s;h|men, &s;top very &s;hort of the principles upon which we &s;upport any given part of our con&s;titution; or even the whole of it together. I could ea&s;ily, if I had not already tired you, give you very &s;triking and convincing in&s;tances of it. This is nothing but what is natural and proper. All government, in|deed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act, is founded on com|promi&s;e
<PB N="425" REF="421">
and barter. We balance inconveniencies; we give and take; we remit &s;ome rights, that we may enjoy others; and, we chu&s;e rather to be hap|py citizens, than &s;ubtle di&s;putants. As we mu&s;t give away &s;ome natural liberty, to enjoy civil advanta|ges; &s;o we mu&s;t &s;acrifice &s;ome civil liberties, for the advantages to be derived from the communion and fellow&s;hip of a great empire. But in all fair dealings the thing bought, mu&s;t bear &s;ome proportion to the purcha&s;e paid. None will barter away the immedi|ate jewel of his &s;oul. Though a great hou&s;e is apt to make &s;laves haughty, yet it is purcha&s;ing a part of the artificial importance of a great empire too dear, to pay for it all e&s;&s;ential rights, and all the in|trin&s;ic dignity of human nature. None of us who would not ri&s;que his life, rather than fall under a go|vernment purely arbitrary. But, although there are &s;ome among&s;t us who think our con&s;titution wants many improvements, to make it a complete &s;y&s;tem of liberty, perhaps none who are of that opinion, would think it right to aim at &s;uch improvement, by di&s;turbing his country, and ri&s;quing every thing that is dear to him. In every arduous enterprize, we con&s;ider what we are to lo&s;e, as well as what we are to gain; and the more and better &s;take of liberty every people po&s;&s;e&s;s, the le&s;s they will hazard in a vain attempt to make it more. The&s;e are <HI>the cords of man.</HI> Man acts from adequate motives relative to his intere&s;t; and not on metaphy&s;ical &s;peculati|ons. Ari&s;totle, the great ma&s;ter of rea&s;oning, cau|tions us, and with great weight and propriety, a|gain&s;t this &s;pecies of delu&s;ive geometrical accuracy in moral arguments, as the mo&s;t fallacious of all &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>THE Americans will have no intere&s;t contrary to the grandeur and glory of England, when they are not oppre&s;&s;ed by the weight of it; and they will ra|ther

In this a&s;&s;urance, my mind mo&s;t perfectly acquie&s;ces; and I confe&s;s, I feel not the lea&s;t alarm, from the di&s;contents which are to ari&s;e, from putting people at their ea&s;e; nor do I apprehend the de&s;truction of this empire, from giving, by an act of free grace and indulgence, to two millions of my fellow citizens, &s;ome &s;hare of tho&s;e rights, upon which I have always been taught to value my&s;elf.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid indeed, that this power of granting ve&s;t|ed in American a&s;&s;emblies, would di&s;&s;olve the unity of the empire; which was pre&s;erved, entire, although Wales, and Che&s;ter, and Durham, were added to it. Truly, Mr. Speaker, I do not know what this unity means; nor has it ever been heard of, that I know, in the con&s;titutional policy of this country. The very idea of &s;ubordination of parts, excludes this notion of &s;imple and undivided unity. England is the head; but &s;he is not the head and the members too. Ireland has ever had from the beginning a &s;eparate, but not an independent, legi&s;lature; which, far from di&s;tracting, promoted the union of the whole. Every thing was &s;weetly and harmoniou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed through both i&s;lands for the con&s;ervation of Engli&s;h dominion, and the communication of Engli&s;h liberties. I do not &s;ee that the &s;ame princi|ples might not be carried into twenty i&s;lands, and with the &s;ame good effect. This is my model with regard to America, as far as the internal circum&s;tan|ces of the two countries are the &s;ame. I know no other unity of this empire, than I can draw from its example during the&s;e periods, when it &s;eemed to my poor under&s;tanding more united than it is now, or than it is likely to be by the pre&s;ent methods.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="423">BUT &s;ince I &s;peak of the&s;e methods, I recollect, Mr. Speaker, almo&s;t too late, that I promi&s;ed, be|fore I fini&s;hed, to &s;ay &s;omething of the propo&s;ition of the <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Lord North.</NOTE> noble lord on the floor, which has been &s;o lately received, and &s;tands on your journals. I mu&s;t be deeply concerned, whenever it is my misfortune to continue a difference with the majority of this hou&s;e. But as the rea&s;ons for that difference are my apology for thus troubling you, &s;uffer me to &s;tate them in a very few words. I &s;hall compre&s;s them into as &s;mall a body as I po&s;&s;ibly can, having al|ready debated that matter at large, when the que&s;|tion was before the committee.</P>
<P>FIRST, then, I cannot admit that propo&s;ition of a ran&s;om by auction;&mdash;becau&s;e it is a meer project. It is a thing new; unheard of; &s;upported by no ex|perience; ju&s;tified by no analogy; without exam|ple of our ance&s;tors, or root in the con&s;titution. It is neither regular parliamentary taxation, nor colony grant. <HI>Experimentum in corpore vili,</HI> is a good rule, which will ever make me adver&s;e to any trial of ex|periments on what is certainly the mo&s;t valuable of all &s;ubjects; the peace of this empire.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, it is an experiment which mu&s;t be fatal in the end to our con&s;titution. For what is it but a &s;cheme for taxing the colonies in the anti-chamber of the noble lord and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors? To &s;ettle the quotas and proportions in this hou&s;e, is clearly impo&s;&s;ible. You, &s;ir, may flatter your&s;elf, you &s;hall &s;it a &s;tate auctioneer with your hammer in your hand, and knock down to each colony as it bids. But to &s;ettle (on the plan laid down by the noble lord) the true proportional payment for four or five and twenty governments, according to the ab&s;olute and the relative wealth of each, and ac|cording to the Briti&s;h proportion of wealth and bur|then,
<PB N="428" REF="424">
is a wild and chimerical notion. This new taxation mu&s;t therefore come in by the back-door of the con&s;titution. Each quota mu&s;t be brought to this hou&s;e ready formed; you can neither add nor alter. You mu&s;t regi&s;ter it. You can do no|thing further. For on what grounds can you deli|berate either before or after the propo&s;ition? You cannot hear the coun&s;el for all the&s;e provinces, quar|relling each on its own quantity of payment, and its proportion to others. If you &s;hould attempt it, the committee of provincial ways and means, or by whatever other name it will delight to be called, mu&s;t &s;wallow up all the time of parliament.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, it does not give &s;atisfaction to the complaint of the colonies. They complain, that they are taxed without their con&s;ent; you an&s;wer, that you will fix the &s;um at which they &s;hall be tax|ed. That is, you give them the very grievance for the remedy. You tell them indeed, that you will leave the mode to them&s;elves. I really beg pardon: it gives me pain to mention it; but you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that you will not perform this part of the compact. For, &s;uppo&s;e the colonies were to lay the duties which furni&s;hed their contingent, upon the importation of your manufactures; you know you would never &s;uffer &s;uch a tax to be laid. You know too, that you would not &s;uffer many other modes of taxation. So that, when you come to explain your|&s;elf, it will be found, that you will neither leave to them&s;elves the quantum nor the mode; nor indeed any thing. The whole is delu&s;ion from one end to the other.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY, this method of ran&s;om by auction, unle&s;s it be <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> accepted, will plunge you into great and inextricable difficulties. In what year of our Lord are the proportions of payments to be &s;et|tled? To &s;ay nothing of the impo&s;&s;ibility that co|lony
<PB N="429" REF="425">
agents &s;hould have general powers of taxing the colonies at their di&s;cretion; con&s;ider, I implore you, that the communication by &s;pecial me&s;&s;ages, and orders between the&s;e agents and their con&s;titu|ents on each variation of the ca&s;e, when the parties come to contend together, and to di&s;pute on their relative proportions, will be a matter of delay, per|plexity, and confu&s;ion, that never can have an end.</P>
<P>IF all the colonies do not appear at the outcry, what is the condition of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, who offer, by them&s;elves or their agents, to tax them&s;elves up to your ideas of their proportion? The refractory colonies, who refu&s;e all compo&s;ition, will remain taxed only to your old impo&s;itions; which, how|ever grievous in principle, are trifling as to produc|tion. The obedient colonies in this &s;cheme are heavily taxed; the refractory remain unburthened. What will you do? Will you lay new and heavier taxes by parliament on the di&s;obedient? Pray con|&s;ider in what way you can do it? You are perfectly convinced that in the way of taxing, you can do no|thing but at the ports. Now &s;uppo&s;e it is Virginia that refu&s;es to appear at your auction, while Mary|land and North Carolina bid hand&s;omely for their ran&s;om, and are taxed to your quota? How will you put the&s;e colonies on a par? Will you tax the tobacco of Virginia? If you do, you give its death-wound to your Engli&s;h revenue at home, and to one of the very greate&s;t articles of your own foreign trade. If you tax the import of that rebellious co|lony, what do you tax but your own manufactures, or the goods of &s;ome other obedient, and already well-taxed colony? Who has &s;aid one word on this labyrinth of detail, which bewilders you more and more as you enter into it? Who has pre&s;ented, who can pre&s;ent you, with a clue, to lead you out of it? I think, &s;ir, it is impo&s;&s;ible, that you &s;hould not re|collect
<PB N="430" REF="426">
that the colony bounds are &s;o implicated in one another (you know it by your other experi|ments in the bill for prohibiting the New-England fi&s;hery) that you can lay no po&s;&s;ible re&s;traints on almo&s;t any of them which may no be pre&s;ently eluded, if you do not confound the innocent with the guilty, and burthen tho&s;e whom upon every principle, you ought to exonerate. He mu&s;t be gro&s;sly ignorant of America, who thinks, that, with|out falling into this confu&s;ion of all rules of equity and policy, you can re&s;train any &s;ingle colony, e&s;|pecially Virginia and Maryland, the central, and mo&s;t important of them all.</P>
<P>LET it al&s;o be con&s;idered, that, either in the pre|&s;ent confu&s;ion you &s;ettle a permanent contingent, which will and mu&s;t be trifling; and then you have no effectual revenue: or you change the quota at every exigency; and then on every new repartition you will have a new quarrel.</P>
<P>REFLECT be&s;ides, that when you have fixed a quota for every colony, you have not provided for prompt and punctual payment. Suppo&s;e one, two, five, ten years arrears. You cannot i&s;&s;ue a trea&s;ury extent again&s;t the failing colony. You mu&s;t make new Bo&s;ton port bills, new re&s;training laws, new acts for dragging men to England for trial. You mu&s;t &s;end out new fleets, new armies. All is to begin again. From this day forward the empire is never to know an hour's tranquillity. An inte&s;tine fire will be kept alive in the bowels of the colonies, which one time or other mu&s;t con&s;ume this whole empire. I allow indeed that the empire of Germa|ny rai&s;es her revenue and her troops by quotas and contingents; but the revenue of the empire, and the army of the empire, is the wor&s;t revenue, and the wor&s;t army, in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="427">INSTEAD of a &s;tanding revenue, you will there|fore have a perpetual quarrel. Indeed the noble lord, who propo&s;ed this project of a ran&s;om by auc|tion, &s;eemed him&s;elf to be of that opinion. His project was rather de&s;igned for breaking the union of the colonies, than for e&s;tabli&s;hing a revenue. He confe&s;&s;ed, he apprehended that his propo&s;al would not be to <HI>their ta&s;te.</HI> I &s;ay, this &s;cheme of di&s;union &s;eems to be at the bottom of the project; for I will not &s;u&s;pect that the noble lord meant nothing but merely to delude the nation by an airy phantom which he never intended to realize. But, whatever his views may be; as I propo&s;e the peace and uni|on of the colonies as the very foundation of my plan, it cannot accord with one who&s;e foundation is perpetual di&s;cord.</P>
<P>COMPARE the two. This I offer to give you is plain and &s;imple. The other full of perplexed and intricate mazes. This is mild; that har&s;h. This is found by experience effectual for its purpo&s;es; the other is a new project. This is univer&s;al; the other calculated for certain colonies only. This is immediate in its conciliatory operation; the other remote, contingent, full of hazard. Mine is what becomes the dignity of a ruling people; gratui|tous, unconditional, and not held out as matter of bargain and &s;ale. I have done my duty in propo&s;|ing it to you. I have indeed tired you by a long di&s;cour&s;e; but this is the misfortune of tho&s;e to who&s;e influence nothing will be conceded, and who mu&s;t win every inch of their ground by argument. You have heard me with goodne&s;s. May you de|cide with wi&s;dom! For my part, I feel my mind greatly di&s;burthened, by what I have done to-day. I have been the le&s;s fearful of trying your patience, becau&s;e on this &s;ubject I mean to &s;pare it altogether in future. I have this comfort, that in every &s;tage
<PB N="432" REF="428">
of the American affairs, I have &s;teadily oppo&s;ed the mea&s;ures that have produced the confu&s;ion, and may bring on the de&s;truction, of this empire. I now go &s;o far as to ri&s;que a propo&s;al of my own. If I cannot give peace to my country; I give it to my con&s;cience.</P>
<P>BUT what (&s;ays the financier) is peace to us without money? Your plan gives us no revenue. No! But it does&mdash;For it &s;ecures to the &s;ubject the power of REFUSAL; the fir&s;t of all revenues. Experience is a cheat, and fact a liar, if this power in the &s;ubject of proportioning his grant, or of not granting at all, has not been found the riche&s;t mine of revenue ever di&s;covered by the &s;kill or by the fortune of man. It does not indeed vote you &pound;. 152 750: 11: 2&frac34;ths, nor any other paltry li|mited &s;um.&mdash;But it gives the &s;trong box it&s;elf, the fund, the bank, from whence only revenues can ari&s;e among&s;t a people &s;en&s;ible of freedom: <HI>Po&s;ita luditur arca.</HI> Cannot you in England; cannot you at this time of day; cannot you, an hou&s;e of com|mons, tru&s;t to the principle which has rai&s;ed &s;o mighty a revenue, and accumulated a debt of near 140 millions in this country? Is this principle to be true in England, and fal&s;e every where el&s;e? Is it not true in Ireland? Has it not hitherto been true in the colonies? Why &s;hould you pre&s;ume that, in any country, a body duly con&s;tituted for any func|tion, will neglect to perform its duty, and abdicate its tru&s;t? Such a pre&s;umption would go again&s;t all government in all modes. But, in truth, this dread of penury of &s;upply, from a free a&s;&s;embly, has no foundation in nature. For fir&s;t ob&s;erve, that, be|&s;ides the de&s;ire which all men have naturally of &s;up|porting the honour of their own government; that &s;en&s;e of dignity, and that &s;ecurity to property, which ever attends freedom, has a tendency to in|crea&s;e
<PB N="433" REF="429">
the &s;tock of the free community. Mo&s;t may be taken where mo&s;t is accumulated. And what is the &s;oil or climate where experience has not uni|formly proved, that the voluntary flow of heaped-up plenty, bur&s;ting from the weight of its own rich luxuriance, has ever run with a more copious &s;tream of revenue, than could be &s;queezed from the dry hu&s;ks of oppre&s;&s;ed indigence, by the &s;training of all the politic machinery in the world.</P>
<P>NEXT we know, that parties mu&s;t ever exi&s;t in a free country. We know too, that the emulations of &s;uch parties, their contradictions, their reciprocal nece&s;&s;ities, their hopes, and their fears, mu&s;t &s;end them all in their turns to him that holds the balance of the &s;tate. The parties are the game&s;ters; but government keeps the table, and is &s;ure to be the winner in the end. When this game is played, I really think it is more to be feared, that the people will be exhau&s;ted, than that government will not be &s;upplied. Whereas, whatever is got by acts of ab|&s;olute power ill obeyed, becau&s;e odious, or by con|tracts ill kept, becau&s;e con&s;trained; will be narrow, feeble, uncertain, and precarious.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Ea&s;e would re|tract vows made in pain, as violent and void.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>I, for one, prote&s;t again&s;t compounding our de|mands: I declare again&s;t compounding, for a poor limited &s;um, the immen&s;e, evergrowing, eternal debt, which is due to generous government from protected freedom. And &s;o may I &s;peed in the great object I propo&s;e to you, as I think it would not only be an act of inju&s;tice, but would be the wor&s;t oeconomy in the world, to compel the colo|nies to a &s;um certain, either in the way of ran&s;om, or in the way of compul&s;ory compact.</P>
<P>BUT to clear up my ideas on this &s;ubject&mdash;a re|venue from America tran&s;mitted hither&mdash;do not
<PB N="434" REF="430">
delude your&s;elves&mdash;you never can receive it&mdash;No, not a &s;hilling. We have experience that from re|mote countries it is not to be expected. If, when you attempted to extract revenue from Bengal, you were obliged to return in loan what you had taken in impo&s;ition; what can you expect from North America? for certainly, if ever there was a country qualified to produce wealth, it is India; or an in|&s;titution fit for the tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, it is the Ea&s;t-India company. America has none of the&s;e aptitudes. If America gives you taxable objects, on which you lay your duties here, and gives you, at the &s;ame time, a &s;urplus by a foreign &s;ale of her commodities to pay the duties on the&s;e objects which you tax at home, &s;he has performed her part to the Briti&s;h re|venue. But with regard to her own internal e&s;ta|bli&s;hments; &s;he may, I doubt not &s;he will, contri|bute in moderation. I &s;ay in moderation; for &s;he ought not to be permitted to exhau&s;t her&s;elf. She ought to be re&s;erved to a war; the weight of which, with the enemies that we are mo&s;t likely to have, mu&s;t be con&s;iderable in her quarter of the globe. There &s;he may &s;erve you, and &s;erve you e&s;&s;entially.</P>
<P>FOR that &s;ervice, for all &s;ervice, whether of re|venue, trade, or empire, my tru&s;t is in her intere&s;t in the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. My hold of the colonies is in the clo&s;e affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from &s;imilar privileges, and equal protection. The&s;e are ties, which, though light as air, are as &s;trong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights a&s;&s;ociated with your government;&mdash;they will cling and grapple to you; and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once under&s;tood, that your govern|ment may be one thing, and their privileges ano|ther; that the&s;e two things may exi&s;t without any
<PB N="435" REF="431">
mutual relation; the cement is gone; the cohe&s;ion is loo&s;ened; and every thing ha&s;tens to decay and di&s;&s;olution. As long as you have the wi&s;dom to keep the &s;overeign authority of this country as the &s;anctuary of liberty, the &s;acred temple con&s;ecrated to our common faith, wherever the cho&s;en race and &s;ons of England wor&s;hip freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have any where. It is a weed that grows in every &s;oil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Pru&s;&s;ia. But until you become lo&s;t to all feeling of your true in|tere&s;t and your natural dignity, freedom they can have from none but you. This is the commodity of price, of which you have the monopoly. This is the true act of navigation, which binds to you the commerce of the colonies, and through them &s;ecures to you the wealth of the world. Deny them this participation of freedom, and you break that &s;ole bond, which originally made, and mu&s;t &s;till pre&s;erve, the unity of the empire. Do not enter|tain &s;o weak an imagination, as that your regi&s;ters and your bonds, your affidavits and your &s;ufferan|ces, your cockets and your clearances, are what form the great &s;ecurities of your commerce. Do not dream that your letters of office, and your in|&s;tructions, and your &s;u&s;pending clau&s;es, are the things that hold together the great contexture of this my&s;terious whole. The&s;e things do not make your government. Dead in&s;truments, pa&s;&s;ive tools as they are, it is the &s;pirit of Engli&s;h communion that gives all their life and efficacy to them. It is the &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, which, infu&s;ed through the mighty ma&s;s, pervades, feeds, unites, invigorates, vivifies, every part of the empire, even down to the minute&s;t member.</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="432">IS it not the &s;ame virtue which does every thing for us here in England? Do you imagine then, that it is the land-tax act which rai&s;es your reve|nue? that it is the annual vote in the committee of &s;upply, which gives you your army? or that it is the mutiny bill which in&s;pires it with bravery and di&s;cipline? No! &s;urely no! It is the love of the people; it is their attachment to their government from the &s;en&s;e of the deep &s;take they have in &s;uch a glorious in&s;titution, which gives you your army and your navy, and infu&s;es into both that liberal obedience, without which your army would be a ba&s;e rabble, and your navy nothing but rotten timber.</P>
<P>ALL this, I know well enough, will &s;ound wild and chimerical to the prophane herd of tho&s;e vulgar and mechanical politicians, who have no place among us; a &s;ort of people who think that nothing exi&s;ts but what is gro&s;s and material; and who therefore, far from being qualified to be directors of the great movement of empire, are not fit to turn a wheel in the machine. But to men truly initiated and rightly taught, the&s;e ruling and ma&s;ter principles, which, in the opinion of &s;uch men as I have mentioned, have no &s;ub&s;tantial exi&s;tence, are in truth every thing, and all in all. Magnanimity in politics is not &s;eldom the true&s;t wi&s;dom; and a great empire and little minds go ill together.
