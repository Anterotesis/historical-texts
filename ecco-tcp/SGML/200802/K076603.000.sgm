<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SINCE your Lord&s;hip had &s;o very con|&s;iderable a Share in the late Debates in the Hou&s;e of Peers, in <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> to a Clau&s;e for the Toleration of the <HI>Chri&s;ti|an Religion it&s;elf,</HI> or of all that <HI>believed the Holy Scrip|tures and the Common Creed</HI>; which I confe&s;s I had a great Hand in preparing and recommending, could it have been admitted; and in <HI>Behalf</HI> of a new <HI>Atha|na&s;ian Te&s;t</HI> to be laid upon Chri&s;tians; whereby, with the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> they were to pro|fe&s;s <HI>Faith in God the Father, and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, his Eternal Son, the True God; and in the Holy Spirit; One God Ble&s;&s;ed for evermore:</HI> Since your Lord&s;hip had al&s;o the like Share in a late heavy Imputation laid on Dr. <HI>C&mdash;</HI> in the &s;ame Hou&s;e of Peers, for omitting the Holy Spirit in Doxologies; where yet that Imputation lay harder on my &s;elf, nay indeed on St. <HI>Paul</HI> and all the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves than on Dr. <HI>C&mdash;</HI>: He having only omitted the Holy Spi|rit in his Doxologics <HI>&s;ometimes,</HI> but I, in Imitation of tho&s;e Apo&s;tles, never making him the direct <HI>Ob|ject</HI> of any Doxology at all. And &s;ince your Lord|&s;hip's
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Chaplain, Mr. <HI>Seaton,</HI> has lately publi&s;h'd an <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Eternity of the Son of God,</HI> addre&s;s'd to the Laity of this City; and written, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, in a cool and &s;ober Manner; but as it were in Vin|dication of &s;uch your Lord&s;hip's Proceedings: I think it cannot, on all the&s;e Accounts, be impro|per for me, who &s;o greatly di&s;&s;ent from your Lord|&s;hip and your Chaplain in the&s;e Matters, to addre&s;s this Paper to your Lord&s;hip, and therein to lay be|fore you and the Chri&s;tian World a fair Collection of the &s;acred and primitive Te&s;timonies concerning this important Point; I mean, whether God the Father be the only Eternal Being, the only Eternal God; or whether the Son and Holy Spirit be al&s;o Eternal Beings, or be <HI>Coeternal</HI> with the Father, as all the real <HI>Trinitarians</HI> a&s;&s;ert. I &s;ay <HI>real Trinitarians</HI> only: for as for the nominal or modal Trinitarians, which al&s;o include the <HI>Sabellians</HI> and <HI>Socinians,</HI> and are now the mo&s;t numerous, who &s;ay the Son and Spirit are not really different from, but are, or make up, together with the Father, the One Eter|nal God, there is no room for the Que&s;tion among them at all: It being the ab&s;urde&s;t Thing in the World to &s;uppo&s;e that God is not coeternal to him|&s;elf, tho' the Expre&s;&s;ion be &s;omewhat extraordinary. Now, in order to &s;atisfy your Lord&s;hip and the World in this Matter, I &s;hall beg Leave at pre&s;ent to wave the common Method of di&s;puting, and ar|guing, and pleading, and drawing uncertain Con|&s;equences on either Side, and &s;hall &s;et down, in&s;tead thereof, a Collection of tho&s;e original Texts and Te&s;timonies which relate to this important Do|ctrine; that &s;o every one may, with his own natu|ral common Sen&s;e and Judgment, and without Fear of being impos'd upon by modern Inferences, im|partially pronounce on which Side the &s;uperior E|vidence lies. Your Lord&s;hip well knows that Truth is be&s;t di&s;cover'd by the open, fair, and &s;olemn Way of Proceedings in Courts of Ju&s;tice; where the Evidence for Facts is &s;till enquir'd into and ex|amin'd from Eye and Ear-Witne&s;&s;es, or from the authentick Records them&s;elves produc'd in Court;
<PB N="3" REF="4">
where the Judges determine of tho&s;e Facts intirely by that original Evidence; and where all that the Pleaders <HI>allege</HI> about tho&s;e Facts goes for nothing, any farther than it is thus <HI>proved.</HI> Now, what was the Doctrine of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour and his Apo|&s;tles, or what was the Chri&s;tian Faith in this Mat|ter, is certainly at this Day an ancient Fact; and no otherwi&s;e to be now known but by ancient Evidence, primitive Witne&s;&s;es, and original Records &s;till re|maining. To the&s;e therefore do I &s;olemnly Appeal in the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion; and by the&s;e and the&s;e only do I re&s;olve to be determin'd therein. And this Method is &s;o evidently fair and rea&s;onable, that I cannot but hope that your Lord&s;hip and all equi|table Enquirers will al&s;o approve of it, and be willing to be determin'd by it. Nor do I mean this with Regard to the pre&s;ent Doctrine, or the real and &s;trict <HI>Coeternity</HI> of the Son and Holy Spirit to the Father only; but with Regard to all the like controverted Points in Chri&s;tianity al&s;o: which can, I think, be no other way &s;o authentickly, &s;o &s;a|tisfactorily, and &s;o peaceably determined among Chri&s;tians as by this Procedure; e&s;pecially while in this Method the Meaning of doubtful Words and Phra&s;es are to be &s;tated no otherwi&s;e than by the ancient U&s;e of the &s;ame; and no modern Di&s;tincti|ons or Eva&s;ions un&s;upported by Antiquity, will be admitted: and where no later Tran&s;lations will be of Weight, any farther than they are &s;upported by the primary Sen&s;e of the Original, in the Ages wherein the Books them&s;elves were written.</P>
<P>I therefore, upon this Occa&s;ion, in the mo&s;t, pub|lick and open Manner, in the Behalf of my &s;elf and of others of my Opinion, as to the Points now in Di&s;pute among us, do, before your Lord&s;hip, and before the Chri&s;tian World, invite all the &s;o|ber and learned <HI>Athana&s;ians</HI> to come into this Propo|&s;al; I mean, that omitting all the Pa&s;&s;ions, the Tricks, the Subtilties, the Di&s;tinctions and Eva&s;ions of the Pleaders or <HI>Di&s;puters of this World,</HI> they will join with us in a calm, a fair, an authentick, a friendly, and a Chri&s;tian Examination of the&s;e Points in the
<PB N="4" REF="5">
Bible and primitive Antiquity; and in drawing up, after &s;uch an Examination, an upright, impartial, and full Collection of all the ancient Texts and Te|&s;timonies, before the Days of <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> which concern the &s;ame; to be by joint Con&s;ent laid be|fore the World; with the bare &s;umming up the E|vidence on both Sides, as the Judges them&s;elves do in their Courts, without any other Comments or Colours of our own what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Thus, for Example, the whole Chri&s;tian Church, My Lord, did ever, and does &s;till unanimou&s;ly own, that there is but <HI>One,</HI> Eternal, Omnipotent, Invi&s;ible, and Almighty <HI>God</HI>; the original Cau&s;e and Creator of all other Beings: While many of the <HI>Trinitarians</HI> now affirm, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, taken together, are that <HI>One God</HI>; and we, on the other Side, a&s;&s;ert that God the Fa|ther, and He alone, is that <HI>One God.</HI> Here, My Lord, we in&s;i&s;t, that the pre&s;ent <HI>Trinitarians</HI> may produce all tho&s;e original Texts of Scripture, all tho&s;e ancient Creeds, and all tho&s;e primitive Te&s;ti|monies, which affirm the former: and we will be oblig'd to produce, in the &s;ame Manner, all tho&s;e original Texts of Scripture, all tho&s;e ancient Creeds, and all tho&s;e primitive Te&s;timonies which affirm the latter: And this is de&s;ir'd as to both Sides, without the Admi&s;&s;ion of any novel Di&s;tinctions, Eva&s;ions, or Inferences what&s;oever: that &s;o Chri&s;tian People may have the Cau&s;e wholly before them, and may be enabled to determine &s;airly and impartially on which Side the <HI>&s;uperior Evidence</HI> appears to be; by which &s;uperior Evidence all certainly ought to be guided in &s;uch Matters. And the like Procedure I would recommend in all parallel Ca&s;es what&s;oe|ver.</P>
<P>And indeed, My Lord, this &s;eems to me to be the only hone&s;t and Chri&s;tian Method of di&s;entang|ling the&s;e and the like Points from the Sophi&s;try of captious Arguments, Replies, and Rejoinders, with which the Writers of Controver&s;y do on all Sides, more or le&s;s, perplex and puzzle, but not properly &s;atisfy their Readers. And this Method,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
I confe&s;s, My Lord, I have had principally in my Eye from the very Beginning of my Concern in the pre&s;ent Controver&s;y; tho' the Pamphlets written again&s;t me have &s;ometimes turn'd me from that my main De&s;ign, and, as it were, forc'd me, in &s;ome Degree, to comply with the common Method. I now therefore, My Lord, intend to rea&s;&s;ume what I at fir&s;t propos'd to my &s;elf; and, as I have lately, which Your Lord&s;hip will &s;ee by the enclos'd, laid the State of the Old Chri&s;tian Doxologies before the World, exactly as I found it in the New Te&s;tament, and in the mo&s;t early Antiquity; without pretend|ing, from any Rea&s;onings of my own, to introduce one &s;ingle Form, different from what I there found upon Record; So do I here de&s;ign to lay before Your Lord&s;hip and the World, with equal Fair|ne&s;s, what I meet with in the fir&s;t Ages concerning this important Point of the &s;trict <HI>Coeternity</HI> of the Son and Holy Spirit to the Father. I &s;ay, the &s;trict <HI>Coeternity</HI> only; for as to the Preexi&s;tence of our Saviour before all <HI>Time,</HI> and all <HI>Ages,</HI> even tho&s;e the Antients called <HI>Eternal Times,</HI> with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. I. 2.</NOTE> or <HI>before the World</HI> with all its Creatures and Ages <HI>be|gan,</HI> as our Ver&s;ion well renders that Pa&s;&s;age, this is not the Que&s;tion. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. I. 2.</NOTE> It being allowed on both Sides that this World, with all its Creatures and Ages what&s;oever, were <HI>made,</HI> under the Father, by the Son; who mu&s;t therefore, of Nece&s;&s;ity, be before the &s;ame, without the lea&s;t Con&s;equence to be thence deduc'd that he was therefore <HI>really eternal,</HI> or truly <HI>coeternal</HI> with his Father.</P>
<P><HI>N.B.</HI> I do not quote the &s;maller Epi&s;tles of <HI>Igna|tius,</HI> nor &s;ome pretended Pa&s;&s;ages out of <HI>Hippolytus, Diony&s;ius Alexandrinus, &amp;c.</HI> they being liable to too many Objections as to their Genuinene&s;s, to bear any Weight in this or any &s;uch Controver&s;y what|&s;oever.</P>
<P>I begin with tho&s;e Texts of Scripture which Your Lord&s;hip's Chaplain, Mr. <HI>Seaton,</HI> has cited for the <HI>Eternity of the Son:</HI> and &s;hall &s;et them down both as they &s;tand in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bible, and as they more authentickly appear in the Septuagint Ver|&s;ion,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
which alone was made Use of by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles. To which I &s;hall add what other Pa&s;|&s;ages occur in the Bible or earlie&s;t Antiquity, that &s;eem mo&s;t to favour the &s;ame Eternity, till the very Days of <HI>Athana&s;ius.</HI></P>

Begat him, we mean, not in Appearance only, but Reality; giving him his Sub&s;i&s;tence by his own Will; the Immutable, and Unalterable, and Perfect Creature of God, but not as one of the ordinary Creatures: A Being begotten by him, but not as one of the ordinary Beings which were begotten. Not that this Being begotten was an Emanation, as was the Doctrine of <HI>Valentinus</HI>; nor, as <HI>Manichaeus</HI> &s;uppos'd, is the Being begotten a Con&s;ub&s;tantial Part of the Father: Nor, as <HI>Sabel|lius,</HI> who divided the Unity, and call'd him both Son and Father: Nor, as <HI>Hieraeas,</HI> Light from a Light, or as one Lamp divided into two: Nor, as one that before was, yet afterward was begotten, or created into a Son. As even you your &s;elf, Ble&s;&s;ed Father, in the mid&s;t of the Church, and in the A&s;&s;embly of the Clergy, have frequently re|jected tho&s;e who introduc'd the&s;e Opinions. But, as we &s;ay, that he was Created by the Will of God before Time, and before the World began; and that he receiv'd his Life, and his Being, and all his Glory from the Father. For the Father, when he made him Heir of all Things, did not deprive him&s;elf of any Thing which he has in him&s;elf, without being begotten. For He is the Fountain of all Things. Wherefore there are three Sub&s;tan|ces, and God him&s;elf, who is the Cau&s;e of all Things, is alone without Beginning. But the Son being begotten by the Father before Time, and created and founded before the World began, was not before he was begotten; but he alone, as
<PB N="23" REF="24">
begotten before Time by the Father, did really &s;ub&s;i&s;t; for he is not eternal, or co-eternal, or unbegotten as the Father is; nor has he his Ex|i&s;tence together with the Father, as &s;ome &s;ay; who after a &s;ort introduce two unbegotten Principles; but God is &s;o before all Things as the only Being, and the Beginning of all Things. <HI>Wherefore he is before his Son, as we have learn'd from you, when you have preach'd in the mid&s;t of the Church.</HI> In as much, therefore, as he has his Being, and all his Glory, and his Life from God; and all Things are deliver'd to him, thence is God his Origin and Governor; for he governs him as his God, and as being <HI>Prior</HI> to him. But if that Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>From him</HI>; and that, <HI>From the Womb</HI>; and that, <HI>I came out from the Father, and come</HI>; are under&s;tood as implying his being a con|&s;ub&s;tantial Part of him, as an Emanation; the Fa|ther is a compound Being, capable of Divi&s;ion, and Mutable; and, indeed, according to them, a Body: And &s;o, as far as their Notions extend, the Incorporeal God is liable to Corporeal Af|fections.</P>

<P>The&s;e, my Lord, are the principal original Texts and Te&s;timonies which concern the important Sub|ject before us, till the very Days of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now, to &s;um up the Evidence on both Sides, with what Clearne&s;s I can, the Evidence for the Co-eternity of the Son to the Father, which has been above alledg'd; I mean, if, as we ought to do, we take the <HI>Septuagint</HI> Ver&s;ion, whence Chri&s;t, and his Apo&s;tles, and the ancient Fathers, always quoted the Old Te&s;tament, to be of more Authority than our own, or any modern ones, in &s;uch Matters, comes to no more than this: <HI>Viz.</HI> That our Saviour was <HI>created</HI> or <HI>begotten</HI> by his Father <HI>in</HI> or <HI>before the Beginning of the World; before</HI> all the <HI>Ages,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. i. 2.</NOTE> or that fir&s;t Con&s;titution of Things which was made or ordain'd by him under the Father: That he was to be the <HI>Father of the future Age,</HI> or <HI>World to come,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. ii. 5.</NOTE> which we call the <HI>la&s;t Age,</HI> or <HI>Days of the Me&s;&s;iah</HI>: That his Origin was <HI>of Old, from the Beginning of the World:</HI> That he <HI>was</HI> in Be|ing, and was <HI>with God</HI> his Father in the very <HI>Be|ginning</HI> of Things; nay, had <HI>Glory with his Father before the World was:</HI> That he was <HI>before all Things</HI>; that he was the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and will be the <HI>la&s;t:</HI> That he was <HI>Alpha,</HI> and will be <HI>Omega:</HI> And that &s;ome of the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions are the &s;ame, or very like to
<PB N="25" REF="26">
tho&s;e, by which the ab&s;olute Eternity of the Fa|ther is in other Places &s;uppos'd to be expre&s;s'd; which la&s;t Ob&s;ervation, however, is only here taken for granted, without Proof: It no Way ap|pearing that the &s;acred Writers meddle, beyond our Faculties, with any &s;uch ab&s;olute Eternity, ei|ther <HI>a parte ante,</HI> or <HI>a parte po&s;t,</HI> as the School-men have &s;ince done; and yet without the Proof of that Point all this Evidence is very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t al&s;o be remembred, that the ancient Chri&s;tians ever allow'd that the Expre&s;&s;ions in the Old Te&s;tament, concerning the invi&s;ible Father, whenever there was a vi&s;ible Per&s;on appear'd, were &s;poken by the Son, as the <HI>Image of that invi&s;ible God,</HI> or as repre&s;enting and per&s;onating the Father, as his Mini&s;ter and Vicegerent among Men: and that they never look'd on them as true, in the high|e&s;t Sen&s;e, of the Son him&s;elf, but of the Father only: Nor did they ever draw &s;uch Con&s;equences from tho&s;e Texts as do the Moderns.</P>
<P><HI>Melchi&s;edek</HI> is, indeed, &s;aid to have <HI>neither Be|ginning of Days, nor End of Life,</HI> when he is repre|&s;ented as a Type of Chri&s;t's earlie&s;t Origin and late&s;t Duration; but this certainly without the lea&s;t Pretence to any proper Eternity of his at all. So that the known Books of the Old and New Te&s;tament, as under&s;tood before the Days of <HI>Atha|na&s;ius,</HI> &s;eem to have no proper Evidence at all for the real Eternity of the Son of God. As for <HI>Po|lycarp</HI>'s and <HI>Ju&s;tin</HI>'s Expre&s;&s;ions of Chri&s;t, that he is the <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 span">, the <HI>eternal</HI> Prie&s;t, or High Prie&s;t, no wi&s;e Man will thence gather any Thing about the real Eternity of the Son, before he was an <HI>High Prie&s;t.</HI> The Author of the Recognitions also &s;peaks of the Eternity of the Son, and calls him the <HI>eternal Chri&s;t</HI>: But then, it is well known, that he did not thereby mean his real Co-eterni|ty, <HI>a parte ante,</HI> with his Father: Nay, it has ap|pear'd already, that of all the Ancients he is the mo&s;t expre&s;s for his being a Creature; and he therefore hereby rather gives us a Rule how we ought to explain &s;uch Words in other ancient Au|thors,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
while they &s;eldom or never mean, by &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions, more than from the Beginning of the World, or to the End of it. <HI>Irenaeus</HI> does, in|deed, &s;ay not only that Chri&s;t was God's <HI>eternal Word,</HI> but that he was <HI>unmade,</HI> or, as I &s;uppo&s;e he means, <HI>not made out of nothing,</HI> as he &s;uppo&s;ed Men to be; that he did <HI>always co-exi&s;t with God,</HI> and was <HI>ever with him</HI>; and avoided &s;aying that God <HI>created him,</HI> which the re&s;t u&s;ed freely to &s;ay in tho&s;e A|ges: All this makes it very probable that this Fa|ther did believe the Eternity of the Son, in &s;ome Sort or other. But then, it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;em|bled, that even <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> as we have &s;een, owns him a derived Being, produc'd by his Father be|fore all other Beings: Which &s;eems hardly recon|cilable to an ab&s;olute Co-eternity: And that this Sort of Eternity of the <HI>Word,</HI> which we meet with in &s;ome &s;uch Philo&s;ophers of the &s;econd, third, and fourth Century, is quite another Thing from the real <HI>Co-eternity of the Son</HI> under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration: As is mo&s;t obvious in the ancient Accounts of that Matter. Their Notion was plain|ly this; that all other Beings were made out of nothing; but that the Son was in a &s;ubtile man|ner <HI>in</HI> his Father, virtually, potentially, or, as his internal Word and Wi&s;dom from all Eternity; and that a little before the Creation, and not &s;ooner, this Word was, in an ineffable manner, begotten or created, out of his Sub&s;tance, into a real &s;ub&s;i&s;ting Being, or Per&s;on: So that the Te|&s;timonies for this Sort of Eternity, which alone we find even till a good while after the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it &s;elf, are a Demon&s;tration that the <HI>real Co-eternity</HI> of the Son with the Father, or his pro|per <HI>eternal Generation,</HI> was then utterly unknown among Chri&s;tians. Nor does even this metaphy|&s;ick, this virtual, or potential, or internal Eter|nity of the Son ever appear in the &s;acred Writings; in the ancient Creeds or Liturgies; or in any of the Apo&s;tolical Fathers. Whereby 'tis plain, that it is no Part of the Sacred, the Apo&s;tolical, or the Chri&s;tian Doctrine; and no more than a Conje|cture
<PB N="27" REF="28">
or Hypothe&s;is of &s;ome ancient Chri&s;tian Phi|lo&s;opers. Whether <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> ever be|liev'd, even in his younger Years, before he was throughly in&s;tructed in Chri&s;tianity, that Chri&s;t was really <HI>eternal,</HI> it is not certain: Becau&s;e the Epithet <HI>eternal</HI> in the former Pa&s;&s;age cited from him does not always denote a real Eternity, and may belong to the Father and not to the Son; and if <HI>Clement</HI> did once call him the <HI>eternal Light</HI> in a Poem, the Latitude of &s;uch Writings, e&s;pe|cially of that romantick Piece a&s;crib'd to him, in|to which this Phra&s;e is in&s;erted, &s;till more plain|ly forbids us to draw any &s;uch &s;ettled Conclu&s;ion from it: E&s;pecially when he el&s;ewhere mo&s;t plain|ly &s;aid, he was the <HI>fir&s;t created Wi&s;dom of God</HI>; and in another Work, directly <HI>depre&s;s'd him into the Rank of a Creature</HI>; as we have already &s;een.

<P>That the Son was al&s;o <HI>voluntarily begotten</HI> by the Power of the Father, we have the plain and nu|merous Te&s;timonies of the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves in their Con&s;titutions, of <HI>Ignatius,</HI> of the Author of the Recognitions of <HI>Clement,</HI> of <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> of <HI>Tatian,</HI> of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> of <HI>Novatian,</HI> of <HI>Lactantius,</HI> of <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> and of the Presbyters and Deacons of <HI>Alex|andria</HI>; without the lea&s;t Syllable, that any one Chri&s;tian thought of his being deriv'd from the Fa|ther, as the Moderns pretend, by <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>That he was al&s;o <HI>created</HI> by God the Father, is al&s;o mo&s;t evident in all Sacred and Chri&s;tian Anti|quity. This Doctrine begins from <HI>Solomon</HI> in the Old Te&s;tament, as explain'd by the Chri&s;tian Re|velation; and is continued by the Son of <HI>Sirach,</HI> and <HI>Philo</HI> the Jew, to the Writers of the New Te|&s;tament, <HI>Peter, Paul, John, Hermas</HI>; the Apo&s;tles in general, in their Con&s;titutions; all the&s;e in the fir&s;t Century: Thence it pa&s;&s;es down to <HI>Ignatius,</HI> to the Author of the Recognitions of <HI>Clement,</HI> to <HI>Ju|&s;tin Martyr, Melito, Tatian,</HI> and <HI>Athenagoras,</HI> in the &s;econ'd Century: And from all the&s;e it comes down to <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, Gregory</HI> of <HI>Neocoe&s;area, Novatian, Cyprian, Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Alex|andria, Theogno&s;tus,</HI> and <HI>Methodius,</HI> in the 3d Cen|tury; to <HI>Lactantius</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> and to the <HI>Alexan|drian</HI> Presbyters and Deacons, nay, even to <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> him&s;elf in the fourth Century; and this, &s;o far as we know, without any one Per&s;on's excepting again&s;t the Word <HI>Created,</HI> as improper, 'till <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>: without any one's a&s;&s;erting that the Son was <HI>uncreated,</HI> till he did it: and with the direct A&s;&s;ertion of &s;everal, that he was a <HI>Creature,</HI> a Being <HI>made</HI> by the Father; tho' va&s;tly &s;uperior to all other Creatures or Beings made by him.</P>
<P>That the <HI>voluntary Generation</HI> or <HI>Creation</HI> of the Son, (for I take them to mean the &s;ame Thing) was a little before the Creation of the World al&s;o, is the only natural Import of almo&s;t all, and the direct A&s;&s;ertion of &s;ome of the Te&s;timonies; with|out the Contradiction of any one Chri&s;tian Writer
<PB N="30" REF="31">
al&s;o, that I know of, till the fourth Century, or the Days of <HI>Athana&s;ius.</HI></P>
<P>That the Body of the Church, even in the Be|ginning of the fourth Century, nay, even at and &s;ome Years after the Council of <HI>Nice</HI> it &s;elf, knew nothing of any real Eternity of the Son; nor de|ny'd that he was a Being begotten or created by the Will and Power of God, a little before the Begin|ning of the World, is very plain from the Te&s;timo|nies here produc'd. So that 'tis hard to &s;ay what ori|ginal Evidence the real Trinitarians have gone up|on, when they have &s;o long made the World believe that the Son is truly <HI>Coeternal</HI> with the Father; and this as a prime Article e&s;tabli&s;h'd at the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> nay, as a fundamental Doctrine of Chri&s;tia|nity it &s;elf; &s;ince, whatever Authority there may be for the <HI>potential</HI> or <HI>metaphy&s;ick,</HI> there &s;eems to be directly none at all for this <HI>real Coeternity,</HI> or pro|per <HI>eternal Generation,</HI> 'till a good while after the Council of <HI>Nice.</HI> Nor would the great and learned <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> when he wrote by the Direction of the Council of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and &s;everal Years after that of <HI>Nice,</HI> have ventur'd openly to charge <HI>Mar|cellus</HI> with Here&s;y, for &s;aying that Chri&s;t was <GAP DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>eternal,</HI> if that his Eternity had been the known De|termination of the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> or indeed the known Doctrine of the Church, either in that or in the foregoing Ages of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>That this Coeternity of the Son is a very &s;trange Doctrine to &s;uch as have the Unity of God for the Foundation of their Religion; &s;uch as all the Pa|triarchs, the Jews, and the Chri&s;tians ever had, will be granted by all. That therefore there was a great Occa&s;ion for a clear and expre&s;s Declaration of this Eternity of the Son, if it were true, is very evident: while yet neither the Scriptures, nor the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions, nor any ancient Creeds what&s;oever, have any one &s;uch clear Declaration; nay, have many &s;uch clear Declarations concerning One only true or eternal God, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. I. 20 1 Tim. 1.17.</NOTE> One only <HI>eternal Power and Godhead,</HI> One only <HI>King of Ages, or eter|nal, immortal, invi&s;ible, the only wi&s;e God,</HI> as &s;uppo&s;es
<PB N="31" REF="32">
the contrary; e&s;pecially while they add to tho&s;e De|clarations, that this One God is no other than the Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus all the old Creeds or Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith do begin with this as the fir&s;t Doctrine of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>I believe in One God the Father</HI>; or as the Bapti&s;mal Creed it&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;titut. 7.41.</NOTE> <HI>I believe in One unbegotten Being, the only true God Almighty, the Father of Christ</HI>; while what they &s;ay of the Son has not the lea&s;t In|timation of either his Coequality or Coeternity, but the contrary; which is particularly the Ca&s;e of the original Creed beforemention'd, where the Ar|ticle concerning the Son begins thus: <HI>I believe in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the only begotten Son of God, the Fir&s;t-born of the whole Creation; who, before the Ages, was begotten by the good Plea&s;ure of the Father</HI>; which &s;eems to me an authentick, a &s;acred, and an undeni|able Te&s;timony again&s;t any real Coeternity of the Son to the Father.</P>
<P>Nor indeed, My Lord, are the Expre&s;&s;ions all along u&s;ed in the foregoing Collection of Texts and Te&s;timonies capable of any fair Sen&s;e, con|&s;i&s;tent with this Coeternity, &s;ince many of them directly confute the &s;ame. Thus the Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions affirm, That God the Father is <HI>eter|nally One only</HI>; or, <HI>The Only Eternal Being</HI>: That tho&s;e are Hereticks who &s;ay [as do the <HI>Trinitarians</HI> in Effect] that God is <HI>three,</HI> or <HI>manifold</HI>; or that there are <HI>three Gods, coeternal with one another.</HI> The Apo&s;tles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> by calling Chri&s;t the <HI>Fir&s;t-born of the whole Creation,</HI> and the <HI>Beginning of the Creation of God,</HI> do in the mo&s;t plain, u&s;ual, and ob|vious Sen&s;e of the Words, and as they were under|&s;tood in the fir&s;t Ages; [e&s;pecially, if we con&s;ider the Allu&s;ion the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages bear to the Text in the <HI>Proverbs,</HI> as then under&s;tood by all, <HI>The Lord crea|ted me, the Beginning of his Ways</HI>] directly affirm that Chri&s;t was <HI>the fir&s;t Being God created.</HI> The Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> directly affirms, that God <HI>made</HI> Chri&s;t; which in the fourth Century was reckon'd &s;o hete|rodox, that this Epi&s;tle was in &s;ome Places &s;eldom read in publick, and that partly out of the Dread of &s;uch an Expre&s;&s;ion; as <HI>Phila&s;trius</HI> a&s;&s;ures us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De Haeret.

<P><PB N="32" REF="33">St. <HI>Peter</HI> is al&s;o introduc'd in that very ancient Book called The <HI>Preaching</HI> of <HI>Peter,</HI> as declaring that God <HI>made</HI> his fir&s;t-born Son. St. <HI>Hermas</HI> directly a&s;&s;erts, that the Holy Spirit, which was placed in a Body, or the Word of God incarnate, was <HI>created</HI> the fir&s;t of all Beings. The Apo&s;tolical Con&s;tituti|ons enjoin us to dedicate our &s;elves to the <HI>eternal God,</HI> not through his <HI>coeternal Word,</HI> as the <HI>Athana&s;i|ans</HI> would certainly have &s;aid; but through <HI>that Word which was in the Beginning</HI>; as the greate&s;t An|tiquity of the Son then known in the Church. <HI>Ig|natius,</HI> and the Author of the Recognitions of <HI>Cle|ment,</HI> a&s;&s;ure us, that the very <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> of our Savi|our was not the <HI>unbegotten Sub&s;tance</HI> of the Father, but was it &s;elf begotten by the Divine Power. The Author of the Recognitions affirms, that Chri&s;t was him&s;elf a <HI>made Being</HI>; and that the Will of God <HI>preceded</HI> his Generation. <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> who al|ways indeed avoided tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions him&s;elf, of a <HI>Creature</HI> and a <HI>made Being,</HI> did not yet in the lea&s;t find Fault with <HI>Trypho</HI> the Jew, when he declar'd that he under&s;tood that both he, and the Scriptures quoted by him, meant that the God of the <HI>Jews made</HI> our Lord and God Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Nor does this <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> among his numerous Expre&s;&s;ions con|cerning the Son's praeexi&s;ting State, of which he is &s;o very full, ever venture to &s;ay any thing that looks like his real Coeternity with the Father. <HI>Ter|tullian,</HI> who yet favour'd the Son's metapyhy&s;ick Eternity as much as any, directly affirms there was a Time <HI>when God was not a Father, and had not a Son. Clement of Alexandria,</HI> whatever he had &s;aid in his younger Years, did at la&s;t own that Chri&s;t was the <HI>fir&s;t created Wi&s;dom of God</HI>; and was to be reckon'd as a <HI>Creature. Origen</HI> did al&s;o plainly and clearly own, that he was one of the Creatures of God, tho' the anciente&s;t of 'em all; even &s;o ancient, that he cared not to a&s;&s;ign the Date of his fir&s;t Generation or Creation; and the Rea&s;on &s;eems to have been, that he had a Fancy that the World it &s;elf, though created by God, might po&s;&s;ibly be coeternal with its Creator. <HI>Gregory</HI> of <HI>Naeocae&s;area</HI> did al&s;o directly
<PB N="33" REF="34">
profe&s;s that Chri&s;t was a <HI>Creature,</HI> or a <HI>Being made</HI> by God. <HI>Novatian</HI> al&s;o, or the acute but unknown Author of the Book concerning the <HI>Trinity,</HI> affirms that God the Father is the <HI>only eternal God,</HI> to whom no other Being can be &s;o much as compar'd; that the Son was then begotten when <HI>it plea&s;ed the Father</HI>; who, and who alone, was <HI>prior</HI> to him; and that as a nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence from his being his Fa|ther. <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> directly affirms Chri&s;t to have been a <HI>Creature</HI>; and &s;uppo&s;es not only a Dif|ference of the Sub&s;i&s;tences of the Father and Son, but a Diver&s;ity of <HI>Sub&s;tance,</HI> an Inferiority of <HI>Power,</HI> and a Difference of <HI>Glory</HI>; &s;o that he, as well as many others, &s;eems not to have had &s;o much as a Notion of a metaphy&s;ick Eternity. <HI>Theogno&s;tus</HI> al&s;o declar'd, that the Son was a <HI>Creature.

as has been formerly exemplify'd at my Hou&s;e; or, however, might jointly pro&s;ecute the &s;ame pious De&s;igns for the Di&s;covery and Re&s;to|ration of the Pure and Holy Religion of our Sa|viour Chri&s;t, as it was <HI>once deliver'd to the Saints,</HI> by &s;uch other Chri&s;tian Methods as they &s;hould judge might better tend to the &s;ame excellent End.</P>
<P>It has hitherto been Your Lord&s;hip's great Glory to have &s;upported and encourag'd that Church of <HI>England</HI> in which you was educated; and the World has great Rea&s;on to believe, by your dai|ly religious Attendance on the Church's Liturgy at Home; as well as by your alike devout week|ly Attendance on the &s;ame publick Service at Church; either of which, in our Age, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, is but too uncommon in Per&s;ons of your Lord&s;hip's Quality; that you are in earne&s;t in &s;uch your Support and Encouragement thereof; or that you do it becau&s;e you believe this Church to be truly agreeable to the Primitive State of the Go&s;|pel. Would it not therefore, My Lord, be &s;till more highly honourable for your Lord&s;hip, to be a Means of making a more careful Review of our Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, Practice, and Di&s;cipline? That &s;o the &s;ame Church, which has long been the Glory and Bulwark of the Prote&s;tant Religion, even in it's pre&s;ent imperfect State, may fir&s;t of all the re&s;t be exactly conform'd to the Perfection of the Chri&s;tian Settlement; and &s;o may be the great Exemplar and Pattern of all the other Churches, as they become gradually &s;en&s;ible of the Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a farther Reformation? All the modern Churches, and among them our own, are, to be &s;ure, very unwilling to allow that they &s;tand in any great Need of a farther Reformation. But as your Lord&s;hip will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that the learn|ed Members of every one of the&s;e Modern Churches declare &s;uch a farther Reformation to be nece&s;&s;ary in all other Churches but their own; &s;o am I ve|ry &s;ure that the truly Learned and Impartial of e|very one of them, who have carefully compar'd

the pre&s;ent Settlements with that of the fir&s;t three Centuries of Chri&s;tianity, do <HI>privately know,</HI> how little &s;oever they may <HI>publickly confe&s;s</HI> that every one of the pre&s;ent Churches, without Exception, do &s;tand in no &s;mall Need of &s;uch a farther Re|formation. I beg Leave, my Lord, to conclude here very nearly in the Words with which I for|merly ended my fourth Volume of <HI>Primitive Chri|&s;tianity Reviv'd.</HI></P>
<P>I do here &s;olemnly appeal, as to the Truth and Fairne&s;s of my Quotations and A&s;&s;ertions, here and el&s;ewhere, to Archbi&s;hop <HI>Wake,</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>Hooper,</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>Smalridge,</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>Potter,</HI> Bi&s;hop <HI>Chandler,</HI> L.

I al&s;o humbly move that, in Order to the&s;e and the like Amendments and Improvements in our Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical E&s;tabli&s;hment, the Preten&s;ions of that wonderful Book &s;till extant, the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Con&s;ti|tutions,</HI> be examin'd, with the like Care, and in the &s;ame publick Manner: And, &s;o far as it &s;hall appear to be a genuine, uncorrupted, Apo&s;tolical Work by <HI>Clemens Romanus,</HI> with the Addition of the mo&s;t authentick original Jewi&s;h and Gentile
<PB N="41" REF="42">
publick Liturgies; <HI>as I am fully per&s;waded it will</HI>; it may then be allow'd its due Weight in the Amend|ment of the Doctrine, Di&s;cipline, Government, Wor&s;hip, and Canons of the Church; or rather, that it may intirely be admitted as an original Rule and Standard in tho&s;e Matters; as all Chri|&s;tians, who believe them genuine, and, [for the Main] uncorrupt, are immediately oblig'd to do: e&s;pecially &s;ince the leaving the&s;e Con&s;titutions, and &s;etting up other Doctrines and Orders in their &s;tead, &s;eem to have been the very Cau&s;es of almo&s;t all the Anti-chri&s;tian Corruptions of the&s;e la&s;t 1200 or 1300 Years together. But if all the&s;e my hone&s;t and well-meant Endeavours and De&s;ires be rejected; and in&s;tead of any Reformation, I my &s;elf be traduc'd, and abus'd, and per&s;ecuted, I can only acquie&s;ce in the Sen&s;e of having &s;incerely, with &s;ome Trouble and Hazard to my &s;elf in this World, di&s;charg'd my Duty; and patiently wait for my Reward in that which is to come. For as to tho&s;e Anathema's, or Names of Di&s;tinction and Reproach, which in this Ca&s;e I mu&s;t expect, I va|lue them not at all: As having long accu&s;tom'd my &s;elf to govern both my <HI>Belief</HI> and my <HI>Life</HI> by the <HI>original Standards of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> without Regard to the contrary Opinions and Practices of the&s;e <HI>later and corrupter</HI> Ages: And &s;o, <HI>LIBERAVI ANI|MAM MEAM.</HI></P>
