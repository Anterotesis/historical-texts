<P>_MR. Fowler &s;et out ye&s;terday for Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire, where he has an e&s;tate. He propo&s;es to go from thence to Caermarthen, to the worthy Sir Rowland. He paid a vi&s;it to Mr. Reeves, and de&s;ir'd him to pre&s;ent to me his be&s;t wi&s;hes and re&s;pects. He declar'd, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly take leave of me, though he doubted not but I would receive him with good|ne&s;s, as he called it. But it was <HI>that</HI> which cut him to the heart: So kind, and &s;o cruel, he &s;aid, he could not bear it.</P>
<P>I hope, poor Mr. Fowler will be more happy than I could make him. Methinks, I could have been
<PB N="2" REF="3">
half-glad to have &s;een him before he went: and yet <HI>but</HI> half-glad; for had he &s;hewn much concern, I &s;hould have been pained.</P>
<P>Take now, my dear, an account of what pa&s;&s;ed this day at St. James's Square.</P>
<P>There were at Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's, be&s;ides Lord and Lady L. the young Lord G. one of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's humble Servants; Mr. Everard Gran|di&s;on; Mi&s;s Emily Jervois, a young Lady of about fourteen, a ward of Sir Charles; and Dr. Bartlett, a Divine; of whom more by-and-by.</P>
<P>Sir Charles conducted us into the drawing-room, adjoining to the dining-room; where only were his two &s;i&s;ters. They received my cou&s;ins and me with looks of Love.</P>
<P>I will tell you, &s;aid Sir Charles, your company, be|fore I pre&s;ent them to you. Lord L. is a good man. I honour him as &s;uch; and love him as my &s;i&s;ter's Hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Lady L. bowed, and looked round her, as if &s;he took pride in her brother's approbation of her Lord.</P>
<P>Mr. Everard Grandi&s;on, proceeded he, is a &s;pright|ly man. He is prepared to admire you, Mi&s;s Byron. <HI>You</HI> will not believe, perhaps, half the hand&s;ome things he will &s;ay to you; but yet, will be the only per&s;on who hears them, that will not.</P>
<P>Lord G. is a mode&s;t young man: He is genteel, well-bred; but is &s;o much in Love with a certain young Lady, that he does not appear with that dignity in her eye [Why blu&s;hes my Charlotte?] that other|wi&s;e perhaps he might.</P>
<P>Are not <HI>you,</HI> Sir Charles, a <HI>mode&s;t</HI> man?</P>
<P>No compari&s;ons, Charlotte. Where there is a double prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; no compari&s;ons!&mdash;But Lord G. Mi&s;s Byron, is a good kind of young man. You'll not di&s;like him, though my &s;i&s;ter is plea&s;ed to think&mdash;</P>
<P>No compari&s;ons, Sir Charles.</P>
<P>That's fair, Charlotte. I will leave Lord G. to the
<PB N="3" REF="4">
judgment of Mi&s;s Byron. Ladies can better account for the approbation and di&s;likes of Ladies, than we Men can.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett you'll al&s;o &s;ee. He is learned, prudent, humble. You'll read his heart in his countenance, the moment he &s;miles upon you. Your grandpapa, ma|dam, had fine curling &s;ilver hair, had he not? The moment I heard that you owed obligation to your grandfather's care and delight in you, I figured to my&s;elf, that he was ju&s;t &s;uch a man, habit excepted: Your grandfather was not a Clergyman, I think. When I have friends whom I have a &s;trong de&s;ire to plea&s;e, I always endeavour to treat them with Dr. Bartlett's company. He has but one fault; he &s;peaks too little: But were he to &s;peak much, every one el&s;e would <HI>wi&s;h</HI> to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>My ward Emily Jervois is an amiable girl. Her father was a good man; but not happy in his nup|tials. He bequeathed to my care, on his death-bed, at Florence, this his only child. My &s;i&s;ter loves her. I love her for her own &s;ake, as well as for her fa|ther's. She has a great fortune: And I have had the happine&s;s to recover large &s;ums, which her father gave over for lo&s;t. He was an Italian merchant; and driven out of England by the unhappy temper of his wife. I have had &s;ome trouble with her; and, if &s;he be living, expect more.</P>
<P><HI>Unhappy temper of his wife,</HI> Sir Charles! You are very mild in your account of one of the mo&s;t aban|doned of women.</P>
<P>Well, but, Charlotte, I am only giving brief hints of Emily's &s;tory, to procure for her an intere&s;t in Mi&s;s Byron's favour, and to make their fir&s;t acquaint|ance ea&s;y to each other. Emily wants no prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in Mi&s;s Byron's favour. She will be very ready her|&s;elf to tell her whole &s;tory to Mi&s;s Byron. Mean|time, let us not &s;ay all that is ju&s;t to &s;ay of the <HI>Mo|ther,</HI> when we are &s;peaking of the <HI>Daughter.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">
I &s;tand corrected, Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Emily, madam (turning to me) is not con&s;tantly re&s;ident with us in town. She is fond of being eve|ry-where with my Charlotte.</P>
<P>And where <HI>you</HI> are, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves whi&s;pered a que&s;tion to Sir Charles, which was &s;econded by my eyes; for I gue&s;&s;ed what it was: Whether he had heard any thing further of Sir Hargrave?</P>
<P>Don't be anxious, &s;aid Sir Charles. All mu&s;t be well. People, long u&s;ed to error, don't, without reluctance, &s;ubmit to new methods of proceeding. All mu&s;t be well.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;tepping out, brought in with him Mi&s;s Jervois. The Gentlemen &s;eem engaged in conver|&s;ation, &s;aid he. But I know the impatience of this young Lady to pay her re&s;pects to Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>He pre&s;ented her to us: This dear girl is my Emily. Allow me, madam, whenever Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on &s;hall be ab&s;ent, to claim for her the benefit of your in&s;truction, and your general countenance, as &s;he &s;hall appear worthy of it.</P>
<P>There are not many men, my Lucy, who can make a compliment to one Lady, without robbing, or, at lea&s;t, depreciating another. How often have you and I ob&s;erved, that a polite brother is a black &s;wan.</P>
<P>I &s;aluted the young Lady, and told her, I &s;hould be fond of embracing every opportunity that &s;hould offer, to commend my&s;elf to her favour.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Emily Jervois is a lovely girl. She is tall, genteel, and has a fine complexion; and, tho' pitted with the &s;mall-pox, is pretty. The &s;weetne&s;s of her manners, as expre&s;&s;ed in her a&s;pect, gives her great advantage. I was &s;ure, the moment I &s;aw her, that her greate&s;t delight is to plea&s;e.</P>
<P>She made me two or three pretty compliments;
<PB N="5" REF="6">
and, had <HI>not</HI> Sir Charles commended her to me, I &s;hould have been highly taken with her.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on entered: Upon my honour, Sir Charles, I can &s;tay no longer, &s;aid he: To know that the fine&s;t woman in England is under the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oof with me; yet to be &s;o long detained from paying my re&s;pects to her&mdash;I can't bear it. And in a very gallant manner, as he &s;eemed to <HI>intend,</HI> he paid his compliments, fir&s;t to me, and then to my two cou|&s;ins:&mdash;And whi&s;pering, yet loud enough to be heard, to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;wore by his &s;oul, that report fell &s;hort of my perfections&mdash;and I can't tell what.</P>
<P>Did I not tell you, that you would &s;ay &s;o, Sir? &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>I did not like the gentleman the better for what I had heard of him: But, perhaps, &s;hould have been le&s;s indifferent to his compliment, had I not before been acquainted with Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick, and Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. The men of this ca&s;t, I think, &s;eem all alike. Poor creatures! how from my heart&mdash;But, indeed, now that I have the honour to know the&s;e two &s;i&s;ters, I de&s;pi&s;e <HI>my&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Sir Charles addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to my cou&s;ins and me, Now, &s;aid he, that my cou&s;in Grandi&s;on has found an opportunity to introduce him&s;elf; and that I have pre&s;ented my ward to you; we will, if you plea&s;e, &s;ee how Lord L. Lord G. and Dr. Bartlett, are engaged.</P>
<P>He led my cou&s;in Reeves into the dining-room.</P>
<P>Lord L. addre&s;&s;ed us with great politene&s;s.</P>
<P>After Sir Charles had pre&s;ented the Doctor to my cou&s;ins, he re&s;pectfully took my hand: Were there fifty Ladies here, my good Dr. Bartlett, whom you had never &s;een before, you would, I am &s;ure, from the character you have had of Mi&s;s Byron, be under no difficulty of reading that character in this young Lady's Face. Mi&s;s Byron, behold in Dr. Bartlett, another grandfather.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
I reverence, &s;aid I, good Dr. Bartlett. I borrow Sir Charles's thought: The character he has given you, Sir, is &s;tamped in your countenance. I &s;hould have venerated you where-ever I had &s;een you.</P>
<P>The gentleman has &s;uch a truly venerable a&s;pect, my Lucy, I could not help &s;aying this.</P>
<P>Sir Charles's goodne&s;s, madam, &s;aid he, as it ever did, prevents my wi&s;hes. I rejoice to &s;ee, and to congratulate, a new &s;i&s;ter, <HI>re&s;tored,</HI> as I will call it in the language of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, to the be&s;t of fa|milies.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then came in a &s;ervant, and whi&s;pered to Sir Charles: Shew the gentleman, &s;aid Sir Charles, into the drawing-room, next the &s;tudy.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on came up to me, and &s;aid many &s;illy things. I thought them &s;o at that time.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves &s;oon after was &s;ent for out by Sir Charles. I did not like his looks on his return.</P>
<P>Dinner being ready to be &s;erved, and Sir Charles, who was &s;till with the gentleman, &s;ummoned to it, he de&s;ir'd we would walk down, and he would wait upon us by the time we were &s;eated.</P>
<P>Some new trouble, thought I, of which I am the cau&s;e, I doubt.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently came in Sir Charles, unaffectedly &s;miling and &s;erene.&mdash;God ble&s;s you, Sir, thought I!&mdash;His looks plea&s;ed me better than my cou&s;in's.</P>
<P>But, my dear, there is &s;omething going forward, that I cannot get out of my cou&s;in. I hoped I &s;hould, when I got home. The Gentleman to whom Sir Charles was called out, was certainly that Bagenhall. Mr. Reeves cannot deny that. I gue&s;&s;ed it was, by Sir Charles's &s;ending in for Mr. Reeves. It mu&s;t be about me.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal charming conver&s;ations. Sir Charles was extremely entertaining. So una&s;&s;uming, &s;o live|ly, &s;o mode&s;t, it was delightful to &s;ee the attention paid to him by the &s;ervants as they waited at table.
<PB N="7" REF="8">
They watched every look of his. I never &s;aw love and reverence &s;o agreeably mingled in &s;ervants faces in my life. And his commands were delivered to them with &s;o much gentlene&s;s of voice and a&s;pect, that one could not but conclude in favour of both, that they were the be&s;t of Servants to the be&s;t of Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on was very gallant in his &s;peeches to me; but very uncivil with his eyes.</P>
<P>Lord L. &s;aid but little; but what he did &s;ay, de|&s;ervedly gained attention.</P>
<P>Every-body reverenced Dr. Bartlett, and was atten|tive when he &s;poke; and would, I dare &s;ay, on his own account, had not the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, by the re|gard he paid him, engaged every one's veneration for him. Many of the que&s;tions which Sir Charles put to him, as if to inform him&s;elf, it was evident he could him&s;elf have an&s;wered: Yet he put them with an air of <HI>teachablene&s;s,</HI> if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf; and re|ceived the Doctor's an&s;wers to them with as much &s;a|tisfaction, as if he were then newly enlightened by them.&mdash;Ah, my Lucy! you imagine, I dare &s;ay, that this admirable man lo&s;t nothing in my eyes, by this his polite conde&s;cen&s;ion. Re&s;erve, and a politene&s;s that had dignity in it, &s;hewed that the fine Gentle|man and the Clergyman were not &s;eparated in Dr. Bartlett.&mdash;Pity they &s;hould be in any of the function.</P>
<P>Sir Charles gave Lord G. an opportunity to &s;hine, by leading the di&s;cour&s;e into circum&s;tances and details, which Lord G. could be&s;t recount. My Lord has been a traveller. He is a connoi&s;&s;eur in Antiquities, and in tho&s;e parts of <HI>nice</HI> Knowlege, as I, a woman, call it, with which the Royal Society here, and the learned and polite of other nations, entertain them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Lord G. appeared to advantage, as Sir Charles ma|naged it, under the awful eye of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. Up|on my word, Lucy, &s;he makes very free with him. I whi&s;per'd her, that &s;he did&mdash;A very Mi&s;s How, &s;aid I.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="9">
To a <HI>very</HI> Mr. Hickman, re-whi&s;pered &s;he.&mdash;But here's the difference: I am not determined to have Lord G. Mi&s;s How yielded to her mother's re|commendation, and intended to marry Mr Hick|man, even when &s;he u&s;ed him wor&s;t. One time or other (archly continued &s;he the whi&s;per, holding up her &s;pread Hand, and with a countenance of admira|tion) my Lord G. is to &s;hew us his collection of But|terflies, and other gaudy in&s;ects: Will you make one?&mdash;</P>
<P>Of the gaudy in&s;ects! whi&s;pered I.&mdash;</P>
<P>Fie, Harriet!&mdash;One of the party, you know, I mu&s;t mean. Let me tell you, I never &s;aw a collection of the&s;e various in&s;ects, that I did not the more admire the Maker of them, and of all us in&s;ects, whatever I thought of the collectors of the minute ones.&mdash;An|other word with you, Harriet&mdash;The&s;e little playful &s;tudies may do well enough with per&s;ons who do not want to be <HI>more</HI> than indifferent to us: But do you think a Lover ought to take high delight in the painted wings of a Butterfly, when a fine Lady has made her|&s;elf all over Butterfly to attract him?&mdash;Eyes off, Sir Charles!&mdash;for he looked, tho' &s;milingly, yet earne&s;tly, at us, as we whi&s;per'd behind the Counte&s;s's chair; who heard what was &s;aid, and was plea&s;ed with it.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day Morning, Mar. 2.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Should have told you, that Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on did the honours of the table; and I will go round it; for I know you expect I &s;hould. But I have not yet done with Lord G.&mdash;Poor man! he is exce&s;&s;ively in Love, I &s;ee that. Well he may. What man would not with Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on? Yet is &s;he too &s;uperior, I think.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="10">
What can a woman do, who is addre&s;&s;ed by a man of talents inferior to her own? Mu&s;t &s;he throw away her talents? Mu&s;t &s;he hide her light under a bu&s;hel, purely to do credit to the man? She cannot pick and choo&s;e, as men can. She has only her negative; and, if &s;he is de&s;irous to oblige her friends, not always <HI>that.</HI> Yet it is &s;aid, Women mu&s;t not encourage Fops and Fools. They mu&s;t encourage Men of Sen&s;e only. And it is <HI>well</HI> &s;aid. But what will they do, if their lot be ca&s;t only among Foplings? If the Men of Sen&s;e do not offer them&s;elves? And pray, may I not a&s;k, if the ta&s;te of the age, among the men, is not Dre&s;s, Equi|page, and Foppery? Is the cultivation of the mind any part of their &s;tudy? The men, in &s;hort, are &s;unk, my dear; and the women but barely &s;wim.</P>
<P>Lord G. &s;eems a little too finical in his dre&s;s. And yet I am told, that Sir Walter Watkyns outdoes him in Foppery. What can they mean by it, when Sir Charles Grandi&s;on is before them? <HI>He</HI> &s;cruples not to modernize a little; but then you &s;ee, that it is in compliance with the fa&s;hion, and to avoid &s;ingularity; a &s;ault to which great minds are perhaps too often &s;ubject, tho' <HI>he</HI> is &s;o much above it.</P>
<P>I want to know, methinks, whether Sir Charles is <HI>very</HI> much in earne&s;t in his favour to Lord G. with re|gard to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. I doubt not, if he be, but he has good rea&s;ons for it.</P>
<P>Were this vile Sir Hargrave out of my head, I could &s;atisfy my&s;elf about twenty and twenty things, that now-and-then I want to know.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois behaved very di&s;creetly. With what plea&s;ure did &s;he hang on every word that fell from the lips of her guardian! I thought more than once of Swift's Cadenus and Vane&s;&s;a. Poor girl! how I &s;hould pity her, were &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly to &s;uffer her grati|tude to lead her to be in Love with her benefactor! In|deed, I pity every-body who is hopele&s;ly in Love.</P>
<P>Now don't you &s;hake your head, my uncle! Did I not
<PB N="10" REF="11">
always pity Mr. Orme, and Mr. Fowler?&mdash;You know I did, Lucy.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois had a &s;mile ready for every one; but it was not an implicit, a childi&s;h &s;mile. It had di|&s;tinction in it; and &s;hewed intelligence. Upon the whole, &s;he &s;aid little, and heard all that was &s;aid with attention: And hence I pronounce her a very di&s;creet young Lady.</P>
<P>But I thought to have done with the <HI>Men</HI> fir&s;t; and here is Mr. Grandi&s;on, hardly mentioned; who, yet, in his own opinion, was not the la&s;t of the men at table.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on is a man of middling &s;tature; not hand&s;ome in my eyes; but &s;o near being hand&s;ome, that he may be excu&s;ed, when one knows him, for thinking him&s;elf &s;o; becau&s;e he is liable to make greater mi&s;takes than that.</P>
<P>He dre&s;&s;es very gaily too. He is at the <HI>head</HI> of the fa&s;hion, as, it &s;eems, he thinks; but, however, is one of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in it, be it what it will. He is a great frequenter of the drawing-room; of all manner of publick &s;pectacles; a leader of the ta&s;te at a new Play, or Opera. He dances, he &s;ings, he laughs; and va|lues him&s;elf on all three qualifications: And yet cer|tainly has &s;en&s;e; but is not likely to improve it much; &s;ince he &s;eems to be &s;o much afraid of &s;uffering in the con&s;equence he thinks him&s;elf of, that whenever Sir Charles applies him&s;elf to him, upon any of his levi|ties, tho' but by the eye, his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, however mild the look, makes him &s;hew an unea&s;ine&s;s at the in&s;tant. He reddens, &s;its in pain; calls for favour by his eyes, and his quivering lips; and has, notwith&s;tand|ing, a &s;mile ready to turn into a laugh, in order to le&s;&s;en his own &s;en&s;ibilty, &s;hould he be likely to &s;uffer in the opinion of the company: But every motion &s;hews his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of inferiority to the man, of who&s;e &s;miles or animadver&s;ions he is &s;o very ap|prehen&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
What a captious, what a &s;upercilious hu&s;band, to a woman who &s;hould happen to have a &s;tronger mind than his, would Mr. Grandi&s;on make! But he values him&s;elf upon his having pre&s;erved his liberty.</P>
<P>I believe there are more bachelors now in England, by many thou&s;ands, than were a few years ago: And, probably, the numbers of them (and of &s;ingle women, of cour&s;e) will every year increa&s;e. The luxury of the age will account a good deal for this; and the turn our Sex take in <HI>un</HI>-dome&s;ticating them&s;elves, for a good deal more. But let not the&s;e worthy young women, who may think them&s;elves de&s;tined to a &s;ingle life, repine over-much at their lot; &s;ince, po&s;|&s;ibly, if they have had no Lovers, or having had one, two, or three, have not found an hu&s;band, they have had rather a mi&s;s than a lo&s;s, as men go. And let me here add, that I think, as matters &s;tand in this age, or indeed ever did &s;tand, that tho&s;e women who have joined with the men in their in&s;olent ridicule of Old Maids ought never to be forgiven: No, tho' Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;hould be one of the ridiculers. An Old Maid <HI>may be</HI> an odious character, if they will tell us, that the bad qualities of the per&s;ons, not the maiden State, are what they mean to expo&s;e. But then they mu&s;t allow, that there are Old Maids of Twenty; and even that there are Widows and Wives of all ages and complexions, who, in the abu&s;ive &s;en&s;e of the words, are as much Old Maids, as the mo&s;t par|ticular of that cla&s;s of females.</P>
<P>But a word or two more concerning Mr. Gran|di&s;on.</P>
<P>He is about Thirty-two. He has had the <HI>glory</HI> of ruining two or three women. Sir Charles has <HI>re|&s;tored</HI> him to a &s;en&s;e of &s;hame [All men, I hope, are born with it] which, a &s;ew months ago, he had got above. And he does not now entertain ladies with in&s;tances of the frailty of individuals of their Sex; which many are too apt, encouragingly, to
<PB N="12" REF="13">
&s;mile at; when I am very much mi&s;taken, if every woman would not find her account, if &s;he wi&s;hes <HI>her|&s;elf</HI> to be thought well of, in di&s;couraging every re|flection that may have a tendency to deba&s;e or expo&s;e the Sex in general. How can a man be &s;uffered to boa&s;t of his vilene&s;s to one woman, in the pre&s;ence of another, without a rebuke, that &s;hould put it to the proof, whether the boa&s;ter was, or was not, pa&s;t blu&s;hing.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on is thought to have hurt his fortune, which was very con&s;iderable, by his free living, and an itch of gaming; to cure him of which, Sir Charles encourages him to give him his company at all oppor|tunities. He certainly has under&s;tanding enough to know how to value the favour; for he owns to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, that he both loves and fears him; and now-and-then tells her, that he would give the world, if he had it, to be able to be ju&s;t what Sir Charles is! Good God! at other times he has broke out, What an odious creature is a Rake! How I hate my&s;elf, when I contemplate the excellencies of this divine Brother of yours!</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of Sir Charles in this place, You, I know, my Lucy, will admire me for my for|bearance.</P>
<P>Lady L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on were the Graces of the Table. So lively, &s;o &s;en&s;ible, &s;o frank, &s;o polite, &s;o good-humour'd, what honour do they and their Brother reflect back on the memory of their mo|ther! Lady Grandi&s;on, it &s;eems, was an excellent woman. Sir Thomas was not, I have heard, quite unexceptionable. How u&s;eful, if &s;o, are the women in the greater, as well as in the le&s;&s;er parts of do|me&s;tic duty, where they <HI>perform</HI> their duty! And what have tho&s;e, who do not, to an&s;wer for, to GOD, to their Children, and even to their whole Sex, for the contempts they bring upon it by their u&s;ele&s;ne&s;s, and
<PB N="13" REF="14">
perhaps extravagance; &s;ince, if the human mind is not actively good, it will generally be actively evil!</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett I have already &s;poken of. How did he enliven the conver&s;ation, whenever he bore a part in it! So happy an elocution, &s;o clear, &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o &s;olid his rea&s;oning. I wi&s;h I could remember every word he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Sir Charles ob&s;erved to us, before we &s;aw him, that he was not forward to &s;peak. But, as I hinted, he threw the occa&s;ions in his way, on purpo&s;e to draw him out: And at &s;uch times, what he &s;aid was ea&s;y, free, and unaffected: And whenever a &s;ubject was concluded, he had done with it. His mode&s;ty, in &s;hort, made him always follow rather than lead a &s;ub|ject, as he very well might do, be it what it would.</P>
<P>I was charmed with the Brachman's prayer, which he, occa&s;ionally, gave us on the antient Per&s;ians be|ing talked of.</P>
<P>Looking up to the ri&s;ing Sun, which it was &s;up|po&s;ed they wor&s;hipped, the&s;e were the words of the Brachman:</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"O THOU (meaning the ALMIGHTY) by whom <HI>Thou</HI> (meaning the Sun) art enlightened, illu|minate my mind, that my actions may be agree|able to THY Will."</Q></P>
<P>And this I will think of, my Lucy, as often as my early hour, for the future, &s;hall be irradiated by that glorious orb.</P>
<P>Every-body was plea&s;ed with Mr. and Mrs. Reeves. Their mode&s;ty, good &s;en&s;e, and amiable tempers, and the kind, yet not o&s;tentatious regard which they ex|pre&s;s to each other (a regard &s;o creditable to the mar|ried &s;tate) cau&s;e them to be always treated and &s;po|ken of with di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>But I believe, as I am in a &s;cribling vein, I mu&s;t give you the particulars of one conver&s;ation; in which farther honour was done to Dr. Bartlett.</P>

After dinner, the Counte&s;s, drawing me on one &s;ide, by both my hands, &s;aid; well, our other &s;i&s;ter, our new-found &s;i&s;ter, let me know how you like us? I am in pain le&s;t you &s;hould not love us as well as you do <HI>our</HI> Northampton&s;hire relations.</P>
<P>You overcome me, madam, with your goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on then coming towards us, Dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;aid I, help me to words&mdash;</P>
<P>No, indeed, I'll help you to nothing. I am jealous. Lady L. don't think to rob me of my Harriet's pre|ferable Love, as you have of Sir Charles's. I <HI>will</HI> be be&s;t &s;i&s;ter here. But what was your &s;ubject?&mdash;Yet I will an&s;wer my own que&s;tion. Some pretty compli|ment, I &s;uppo&s;e; Women to women. Women hunger and thir&s;t a&s;ter compliments.

<P>You need not be <HI>jealous,</HI> Charlotte, &s;aid the Coun|te&s;s: You may be <HI>&s;ure.</HI> This &s;aucy girl, Mi&s;s Byron, is ever fru&s;trating her own preten&s;ions. Can flattery, Charlotte, &s;ay what we will, have place <HI>here?</HI>&mdash;But tell me, Mi&s;s Byron, how you like Dr. Bartlett?</P>
<P>Ay, tell us, Harriet, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, how you like Dr. Bartlett? Pray, Lady L. don't antici|pate me: I propo&s;e to give our new &s;i&s;ter the hi&s;tory of us all. And is not Dr. Bartlett one of <HI>us?</HI> She has already given me the hi&s;tory of all her friends, and of her&s;elf: And I have communicated to you, like a good &s;i&s;ter, all &s;he has told me.</P>
<P>I con&s;idered Dr. Bartlett, I &s;aid, as a Saint; and at the &s;ame time, as a man of true politene&s;s.</P>
<P>He is indeed, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, all that is worthy and amiable in man. Don't you &s;ee how Sir Charles admires him?</P>
<P>Pray Lady L. keep clear of my province. Here is Sir Charles. He will not let us break into parties.</P>
<P>Sir Charles heard this la&s;t &s;entence&mdash;Yet I wonder

<P>The Doctor approached in a mo&s;t graceful man|ner&mdash;Let me again, Mi&s;s Byron, pre&s;ent Dr. Bartlett to you, as a man that is an honour to his cloth; and that is the &s;ame thing, as if I &s;aid, to human nature [The good man bowed in &s;ilence]; and Mi&s;s Byron, to you, my good Doctor, taking my hand, as a Lady mo&s;t worthy your di&s;tingui&s;hed re|gard.</P>
<P>You do me too much honour, Sir, &s;aid I. I &s;hall hope, good Doctor Bartlett, by your in&s;tructions, to be enabled to de&s;erve &s;uch a recommendation.</P>
<P>My dear Harriet, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, &s;natching my other hand, you are a <HI>good</HI> girl; and that is more to your honour than Beauty.</P>
<P>Be quiet, Lady L. &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on came up&mdash;What! Is there not an|other hand for me?</P>
<P>I was vexed at his interruption. It prevented Dr. Bartlett from &s;aying &s;omething that his lips were opening to &s;peak with a &s;mile of benignity.</P>
<P>How the World, &s;aid Sir Charles, &s;miling, will pu&s;h it&s;elf in! <HI>Heart,</HI> not <HI>Hand,</HI> my dear Mr. Gran|di&s;on was the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Whenever You, Sir Charles, and the Doctor, and the&s;e Ladies, are got together, I know I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be un|&s;ea&s;onable: But if you exclude me &s;uch company, how &s;hall I ever be what you and the Doctor would have me to be.</P>
<P>Lord L. and Lord G. were coming up to us: See your attraction, Mi&s;s Byron! &s;aid the Counte&s;s.</P>

<P>How cruel is this! &s;aid Mr Grandi&s;on, appealing to Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Indeed I think it is a little cruel, Charlotte.</P>

<P>Well, well, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on, I will be good, as fa&s;t as I can: But, Doctor, what &s;ay you?&mdash;Rome was not built in a day.</P>
<P>I have great hopes of Mr. Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the Doctor. But, Ladies, you mu&s;t not, as Mr. Gran|di&s;on ob&s;erved, exclude from the benefit of your con|ver&s;ation, the man whom you wi&s;h to be good.</P>

<P>But, what, Sir Charles? (come, I had rather take my cue from you, than any-body:) what are the &s;igns which I am to give to be allowed&mdash;</P>
<P>Only the&s;e, my cou&s;in&mdash;When you can be &s;erious on &s;erious &s;ubjects; yet &s;o chearful in your &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, as if it &s;at ea&s;y upon you; when you can, at times, prefer the company and conver&s;ation of Dr. Bartlett, who is not a &s;olemn or &s;evere man, to any other; and, in general, had rather &s;tand well in his opinion, than in that of the gaye&s;t man or woman in the world.</P>
<P>Provided yours, Sir Charles, may be added to the Doctor's&mdash;</P>
<P>Command me, Mr. Grandi&s;on, whenever you two are together. We will not oppre&s;s you with our &s;ub|jects.

<P>You were always indulgent to me, Sir Charles, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on; and I have retired, and blu&s;hed to my&s;elf, &s;ometimes, for <HI>wanting</HI> your indulgence.</P>
<P>Tea was preparing. Sir Charles took his own &s;eat next Lord L. whom he &s;et in to talk of Scotland. He enjoyed the account my Lord gave of the plea&s;ure which the Counte&s;s, on that her fir&s;t journey into tho&s;e parts, gave to all <HI>his</HI> family and friends; as Lady L. on her part, acknowleged &s;he had a grateful &s;en&s;e of <HI>their</HI> goodne&s;s to her.</P>
<P>I rejoice, &s;aid Sir Charles, that the &s;ea divides us not from &s;uch worthy people, as you, my Lord, have given us a relation to. Next vi&s;it you make (Char|lotte, I hope, will accompany me) I intend to make one in your train, as I have told your Lord&s;hip be|fore.</P>
<P>You will add to our plea&s;ure, Sir Charles. All my relations are prepared to do you honour.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, did not the Ladies think a little hardly of your Lord&s;hip's engagement? that a man of your merit &s;hould go from Scotland for a wife? I do a&s;&s;ure you, my Lord, that, in all the countries I have been in, I never &s;aw finer women than I have &s;een in Scotland; and in very few nations, tho' &s;ix times as large, greater numbers of them.</P>
<P>I <HI>was</HI> to be the happie&s;t of men, Sir Charles, in a Grandi&s;on&mdash;I thank <HI>you,</HI> bowing.</P>
<P>It is one of my felicities, my Lord, that my &s;i&s;ter calls her&s;elf yours.</P>

<P>I can tell you how, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on, to repay that nation&mdash;You, Sir Charles, &s;hall go down, and bring up with a you Scoti&s;h Lady.</P>
<P>I was vexed with my&s;elf for &s;tarting. I could not help it.</P>
<P>Don't you think, Lucy, that Sir Charles made a very fine compliment to the Scoti&s;h Ladies?&mdash;I own, that I have heard the women of our Northern coun|ties prai&s;ed <HI>al&s;o.</HI> But are there not, think you, as pretty women in England?</P>

<P>My dear Dr. Bartlett, interrupted Sir Charles, from you, and from my good Lord L. the&s;e fine things are not to be borne. From my three &s;i&s;ters, looking at <HI>me</HI> for one, and from my dear ward, I cannot be &s;o unea&s;y, when they will not be re&s;trained from acknow|ledging,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
that I have &s;ucceeded in my endeavours to perform my <HI>duty</HI> to them.</P>
<P>I long to know, as I &s;aid once before, the particu|lars of what Sir Charles has done, to oblige every|body in &s;o high a manner. Don't <HI>you,</HI> Lucy? Ble&s;s me! what a deal of time have I wa&s;ted &s;ince I came to town? I feel as if I had wings, and had &s;oared to &s;o great an height, that every thing and per&s;on that I before behold without di&s;&s;atisfaction, in this great town, looks diminutive and little under my aking eye. Thus, my dear, it mu&s;t be in a better world, if we are permitted to look back upon the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> of our &s;atisfactions in this.</P>
<P>I was a&s;ked to give them a le&s;&s;on on the harp&s;i|chord after tea. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;aid, Come, come, to prevent all excu&s;es, I will &s;hew you the way.</P>
<P>Let it then be, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on, Shake&s;pear's Cuckow. You have made me enter with &s;o much comparative &s;hame into my&s;elf, that I mu&s;t have &s;ome|thing lively to rai&s;e my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Well, &s;o it &s;hall, replied Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. Our poor cou&s;in does not know what to do with him&s;elf when you are got a little out of his reach.</P>
<P>That is not fair, Charlotte, &s;aid Sir Charles. It is not that graceful manner of obliging, in which you generally excel. Compliance and Reflection are not to be coupled.</P>
<P>Well, well, but I will give the good man his Cuc|kow, to make him amends.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he &s;ung that ballad from Shake&s;pear; and with &s;o much &s;pirit and humour, as delighted every-body.</P>
<P>Sir Charles being a judge of mu&s;ick, I looked a little &s;illier than common, when I was again called upon.</P>
<P>Come, my dear, &s;aid the kind Counte&s;s, I will pre|pare you a little further. When you &s;ee your two elder &s;i&s;ters go before you, you will have more cou|rage.</P>

She &s;at down, and play'd one of Scarlatti's le&s;&s;ons; which, you know, are made to &s;hew a fine hand. And &s;urely, for the &s;wiftne&s;s of her fingers, and the elegance of her manner, &s;he could not be equalled.</P>
<P>It is referred to you, my third Si&s;ter, &s;aid Sir Charles (who had been taken a&s;ide by Mr. Reeves; &s;ome whi&s;pering talk having pa&s;&s;ed between them) to favour us with &s;ome of Handel's mu&s;ick: Mrs. Reeves &s;ays, &s;he has heard you &s;ing &s;everal &s;ongs out of the Pa&s;toral, and out of &s;ome of his fine&s;t Oratorios.</P>
<P>Come hither, come hither, my &s;weet Harriet&mdash;Here's his Alexander's Fea&s;t: My brother admires that, I know; and &s;ays it is the noble&s;t compo&s;ition that ever was produced by man; and is as finely &s;et, as written.</P>
<P>She made me &s;it down to the in&s;trument.</P>
<P>As you know, &s;aid I, that great part of the beauty of this performance ari&s;es from the proper tran&s;itions from one different &s;train to another, any one &s;ong mu&s;t lo&s;e greatly, by being taken out of its place; and I fear&mdash;</P>
<P>Fear nothing, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid Sir Charles: Your obligingne&s;s, as well as your ob&s;ervation, intitle you to all allowances.</P>

<P>Which not being &s;et &s;o full with accompanying &s;ymphonies, as mo&s;t of Mr. Handel's are, I performed with the more ea&s;e to my&s;elf, tho' I had never but once before play'd it over.</P>
<P>They all, with more compliments than I dare re|peat, reque&s;ted me to play and &s;ing it once more.</P>
<P><HI>Dare repeat!</HI> methinks I hear my uncle Selby &s;ay. The girl that does nothing el&s;e but repeat her own prai&s;es, comes with her, <HI>If I dare repeat.</HI></P>

Yes, Sir, I an&s;wer; for compliments that do not elevate, that do not touch me, run glibly off my pen: But &s;uch as <HI>indeed</HI> rai&s;e one's vanity; how can one <HI>avow</HI> that vanity by writing them down?&mdash;But they were re&s;olved to be plea&s;ed before I began.</P>
<P>One compliment, however, from Sir Charles, I cannot, I find, pa&s;s over in &s;ilence. He whi&s;pered Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, as he leaned upon my chair. How could Sir Hargrave Pollexfen have the heart to endea|vour to &s;top &s;uch a mouth as that!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. Mi&s;s <HI>HARRIET BYRON,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>LUCY SELBY.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Thur&s;day Night, Mar. 2.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AND what do you think was the rea&s;on of Mr. Reeves's re&s;erves? A mo&s;t alarming one. I am obliged to him, that he kept it from me, tho' the un|certainty did not a little affect me. Take the account of it, as it comes out.</P>
<P>I told you in my former, that the per&s;on to whom Sir Charles was &s;ent for out, was Mr. Bagenhall; and that Sir Charles had &s;ent in for Mr. Reeves, who re|turned to the company with a countenance that I did not like &s;o well as I did Sir Charles's. I now proceed to give you, from Minutes of Mr. Reeves, what pa&s;|&s;ed on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir Charles took Mr. Reeves a&s;ide&mdash;This unhappy man (Sir Hargrave, I mean, &s;aid he) &s;eems to me to want an excu&s;e to him&s;elf, for putting up with a treat|ment which he thinks di&s;graceful. When we have to deal with children, humours mu&s;t be a little allow|ed for. But you'll hear what the propo&s;al is now. Let not the Ladies, however, nor the Gentlemen, within, know any thing of the matter till all is over. This is a day devoted to plea&s;ure. But <HI>you,</HI> Mr. Reeves, know &s;omething of the matter; and can an|&s;wer for your fair cou&s;in.</P>
<P>He then led Mr. Reeves in to Mr. Bagenhall.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is Mr. Reeves.&mdash;Sir Hargrave, in &s;hort, Mr. Reeves, among other demands that I cannot comply with (but which relate only to my&s;elf, and therefore need not be mentioned) in&s;i&s;ts upon an in|troduction to Mi&s;s Byron. He &s;ays, &s;he is ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged&mdash;Is &s;he, Sir?</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay &s;he is, an&s;wered my cou&s;in.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
This gentleman has been naming to me Mr. Gre|ville, Mr. Orme, and others.</P>
<P>No one of them has ever met with the &s;hadow of encouragement from my cou&s;in. She is above keep|ing any man in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, when &s;he is not in any her|&s;elf. Nothing has given her more unea&s;ine&s;s than the number of her Admirers.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid Sir Charles, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be admired by every one that beholds her; but &s;till more by tho&s;e who are admitted to the honour of conver&s;ing with her. But Sir Hargrave is willing to build upon her di&s;engagement &s;omething in his own favour. Is there any room for Sir Hargrave, who pleads his &s;ufferings for her; who vows his honourable intentions even at the time that he was hoping to gain her by &s;o unmanly a violence; and appeals to her for the purity, as he calls it, of his behaviour to her, all the time &s;he was in his hands&mdash;who makes very large offers of &s;ettlements&mdash;is there any room to hope, that Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;</P>
<P>No, none at all, Sir Charles&mdash;</P>
<P>What! not to &s;ave a life, Mr. Reeves?&mdash;&s;aid Mr. Bagenhall.</P>
<P>If you mean mine, Mr. Bagenhall, replied Sir Charles, I beg that that may not be con&s;idered. If Sir Hargrave means his own, I will pronounce that &s;afe from any premeditated re&s;entment of mine. Do you think Mi&s;s Byron will bear to &s;ee Sir Hargrave, Mr Reeves? I pre&s;ume he intends to beg pardon of her. Will &s;he con&s;ent to receive a vi&s;it from him?&mdash;But is not this wretched tri&s;ling, Mr. Bagenhall?</P>
<P>You will remember, Sir Charles, this is a propo&s;al of <HI>mine:</HI> what I <HI>hoped</HI> might be agreed to by Sir Har|grave; but that I was willing to con&s;ult you before I mentioned it to him.</P>
<P>I beg your pardon, Mr. Bagenhall: I now remem|ber it.</P>
<P>If ever man doated upon a woman, &s;aid Mr. Bagen|hall,
<PB N="26" REF="27">
it is Sir Hargrave on Mi&s;s Byron. The very methods he took to obtain her for a wife, &s;hew that mo&s;t convincingly.&mdash;You will promi&s;e not to &s;tand in his way Sir.</P>
<P>I repeat, Mr. Bagenhall, what I have heretofore told you; That Mi&s;s Byron (You'll excu&s;e me, Mr. Reeves) is &s;till under my protection. If Sir Hargrave, as he ought, is inclin'd to a&s;k her pardon; and if he can obtain it, and even upon his own terms; I &s;hall think Mi&s;s Byron and he may be happier together than at pre&s;ent I can imagine it po&s;&s;ible. I am not de&s;irous to be any-way con&s;idered, but as her protector from violence and in&s;ult; and that I will be, if &s;he claim it, in defiance of an hundred &s;uch men as Sir Hargrave. But then, Sir, the occa&s;ion mu&s;t be &s;ud|den. No legal relief mu&s;t be at hand. I will not, either for an adver&s;ary's &s;ake, or my own, be defied into a cool and premeditated vengeance.</P>
<P>But, Sir Charles, Sir Hargrave has &s;ome hard&s;hips in this ca&s;e. You will not give him the &s;atisfaction of a Gentleman: And, according to the Laws of Ho|nour, a man is not intitled to be <HI>treated</HI> as a Gentle|man, who denies to one&mdash;</P>
<P>Of who&s;e making, Mr. Bagenhall, are the Laws of Honour you mention? I own no Laws, but the Laws of GOD and my Country. But, to cut this matter &s;hort, tell Sir Hargrave, that, little as is the dependence a Man of Honour can have upon that of a man, who has acted by an helple&s;s woman, as he has acted by Mi&s;s Byron, I will breakfa&s;t with him in his own hou&s;e to-morrow morning, if he contradicts it not. I will attribute to the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion for the Lady, the unmanly outrage he was guilty of. I will &s;uppo&s;e him mi&s;taken enough to imagine, that he &s;hould make her amends by marriage, if he could compel her hand; and will tru&s;t my per&s;on to his ho|nour, one &s;ervant only to walk before his door, not to enter the hou&s;e, to attend my commands, after our
<PB N="27" REF="28">
conver&s;ation is over. My &s;word, and my &s;word on|ly, &s;hall be my companion: But this rather, that I would not be thought to owe my &s;afety to the want of it, than in expectation, after &s;uch confidence placed in him, to have occa&s;ion to draw it in my own de|fence. And pray, Mr. Bagenhall, do you, his friend, be pre&s;ent; and any other friends, and to what num|ber, he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>When I came to this place in my cou&s;in's Mi|nutes, I was a&s;toni&s;hed; I was out of breath upon it.</P>
<P>Mr. Bagenhall was &s;urpri&s;ed; and a&s;ked Sir Charles, if he were in earne&s;t?</P>
<P>I would not be thought a ra&s;h man, Mr. Bagen|hall. Sir Hargrave <HI>threatens</HI> me: I never avoid a threatener. <HI>You</HI> &s;eem to hint, Sir, that I am not in|titled to fair play, if I con&s;ent not to meet him with a murderous intention. With &s;uch an intention I never will meet any man; though I have as much rea&s;on to rely on the &s;kill of my arm, as on the ju&s;tice of my cau&s;e. If foul play is hinted at, I am no more &s;afe from an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in in my bedchamber, than in Sir Har|grave's hou&s;e. Something mu&s;t be done by a man who refu&s;es a challenge, to let a challenger &s;ee (&s;uch is the world, &s;uch is the cu&s;tom) that he has <HI>better</HI> motives than fear, for his refu&s;al. I will put Sir Har|grave's Honour to the fulle&s;t te&s;t: Tell him, Sir, that I will bear a great deal; but that I will not be in&s;ult|ed, were he a Prince.</P>
<P>And you really would have me&mdash;</P>
<P>I would, Mr. Bagenhall. Sir Hargrave, I &s;ee, will not be &s;atisfied, unle&s;s &s;omething extraordinary be done: And if I hear not from you, or from him, I will attend him by ten to-morrow morning, in an amicable manner, to breakfa&s;t at his own hou&s;e in Cavendi&s;h Square.</P>
<P>I am in terror, Lucy, even in tran&s;cribing only.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves, &s;aid Sir Charles, you undo me, if one word of this matter e&s;cape you, even to your wife.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29">
Mr. Reeves begged, that he might attend him to Sir Hargrave's.</P>
<P>By no means, Mr. Reeves.</P>
<P>Then, Sir Charles, you apprehend danger.</P>
<P>I do <HI>not.</HI> Something, as I &s;aid, mu&s;t be done. This is the &s;horte&s;t and be&s;t method to make all par|ties ea&s;y. Sir Hargrave thinks him&s;elf &s;lighted. He may infer, if he plea&s;es, in his own favour, that I do <HI>not</HI> de&s;pi&s;e a man, in whom I can place &s;uch a confi|dence. Do you, Mr. Reeves, return to company; and let no one know the occa&s;ion of your ab&s;ence, or of mine, from it.</P>
<P>I have told you, my dear, what a difference there was in the countenances of both, when each &s;eparately entered the dining-room. And could this great man (&s;urely I may call him <HI>great)</HI> could he, in <HI>&s;uch</HI> cir|cum&s;tances, on his return, give joy, plea&s;ure, en|tertainment, to all the company, without the lea&s;t cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion of what had pa&s;&s;ed?</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves, as I told you, &s;ingled out Sir Charles in the evening to know what had pa&s;&s;ed after he left him and Mr. Bagenhall. Sir Charles acquainted him, that Mr. Bagenhall had propo&s;ed to let him know that night, or in the morning, how Sir Hargrave approved of his intended vi&s;it. He has, accordingly, &s;ignified to me already, &s;aid Sir Charles, that Sir Hargrave ex|pects me.</P>
<P>And will you go, Sir?</P>
<P>Don't give your&s;elf concern about the matter, Mr. Reeves. All mu&s;t end well. My intention is, not to run into mi&s;chief, but to prevent it. My principles are better known abroad, than they are in England. I have been challenged more than once by men, who knew them, and thought to find their &s;afety from them. I have been obliged to take &s;ome extraordi|nary &s;teps to &s;ave my&s;elf from in&s;ult; and tho&s;e &s;teps have an&s;wered my end, in more licentious countries
<PB N="29" REF="30">
than this. I hope this &s;tep will pre&s;erve me from calls of this nature in my own country.</P>
<P>For God's &s;ake, Sir Charles&mdash;</P>
<P>Be not unea&s;y on my account, Mr. Reeves. Does not Sir Hargrave value him&s;elf upon his fortune? He would be loth to forfeit it. <HI>His</HI> fortune is <HI>my</HI> &s;ecurity. And am I not a man of &s;ome con&s;equence my&s;elf? Is not the affair between us known? will not therefore the cau&s;e ju&s;tify me, and condemn him? The man is turbulent; he is unea&s;y with him&s;elf; he knows him|&s;elf to be in the wrong. And &s;hall a man, who re|&s;olves to pay a &s;acred regard to laws divine and hu|man, fear this Goth? 'Tis time enough to fear, when I can be unju&s;t. If you value my friend&s;hip, as I do yours, my good Mr. Reeves, proceeded he, I &s;hall be &s;ure of your ab&s;olute &s;ilence. I will attend Sir Hargrave by ten to-morrow morning. You will hear from me, or &s;ee me at your own hou&s;e, by twelve.</P>
<P>And then it was, as Mr. Reeves tells me, that Sir Charles turned from him, to encourage me to give the company a le&s;&s;on from Dryden's Alexander's Fea&s;t, as &s;et by Handel; which I cho&s;e to be in the lines, <HI>Softly &s;weet,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves went out in the morning. My cou&s;in &s;ays, he had been exce&s;&s;ively unea&s;y all night. He now owns, he called at St. James's Square, and there breakfa&s;ted with Lord and Lady L. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, Mi&s;s Emily, and Dr. Bartlett. Sir Charles went out at nine, in a chair, one &s;ervant only attending him: The family knew not whither. And his two &s;i&s;ters were fomenting a rebellion again&s;t him, as they hu|mourou&s;ly called it, for his keeping from them (who kept nothing from <HI>him)</HI> his motions, when they and my Lord were together, and at his hou&s;e: But my Lord and Mi&s;s Emily plea&s;antly refu&s;ed to join in it. Mr. Reeves told us, on his return, that his heart was &s;o &s;unk, that they took great notice of his dejection.</P>
<P>About three o'clock, ju&s;t as Mr. Reeves was de|termined
<PB N="30" REF="31">
to go to St James's Square again, and, if Sir Charles had not been heard of, to Cavendi&s;h-Square (tho' irre&s;olute what to do when there) the following billet was brought him from Sir Charles. After what I have written, does not your heart leap for joy, my Lucy?</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATE><HI>Half an hour after two.</HI></DATE><SALUTE>Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Will do my&s;elf the honour of vi&s;iting Mr. Reeves, Mi&s;s Byron, and you, at your u&s;ual tea-time, if you are not engaged. I tell the Ladies here, that tho&s;e who have lea&s;t to do, are generally the mo&s;t bu&s;y people in the world. I can therefore be only an&s;wer|able, on this vi&s;it, for, Sir,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your mo&s;t humble Servant,

</LETTER>
<P>Then it was, that, vehemently urged both by my cou&s;in and me, Mr. Reeves gave us briefly the cau&s;e of his unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>About &s;ix o' clock, Sir Charles came in a chair. He was charmingly dre&s;&s;ed. I thought him, the mo|ment he enter'd, the hand&s;ome&s;t man I ever &s;aw in my life. What a tran&s;porting thing mu&s;t it be, my Lucy, to an affectionate wife, without re&s;traint, with|out check, and performing nothing but her duty, to run with open arms to receive a worthy hu&s;band, re|turning to her after a long ab&s;ence, or from an e&s;caped danger! How cold, how joyle&s;s!&mdash;But no! I was neither cold, nor joyle&s;s; for my face, as I felt it, was in a glow; and my heart was ready to bur&s;t with congratulatory meaning, at the vi&s;ible &s;afety, and un|hurt per&s;on, of the man who had laid me before un|der &s;uch obligations to him, as were too much for my gratitude. O do not, do not tell me, my dear friends, that <HI>you</HI> love him, that <HI>you</HI> wi&s;h me to be his. I &s;hall be ready, if you <HI>do,</HI> to wi&s;h&mdash;I don't know what I would &s;ay: But <HI>your</HI> wi&s;hes were always the leaders of <HI>mine.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">
Mrs. Reeves, having the &s;ame cau&s;e for apprehen|&s;ion, could hardly re&s;train her&s;elf when he entered the room. She met him at the door, her hand held out, and with &s;o much emotion, that Sir Charles &s;aid, How well, Mr. Reeves, you have kept my &s;ecret!&mdash;Mr. Reeves told him, what an unea&s;ine&s;s he had laboured under from the preceding evening; and how &s;ilent he had been, till his welcome billet came.</P>
<P>Then it was that both my cou&s;ins, with equal free|dom, congratulated him.</P>
<P>And I'll tell you how the Fool, the maiden Fool, looked and acted. Her feet in&s;en&s;ibly moved to meet him, while he was receiving the freer compliments of my cou&s;ins. I courte&s;ied ba&s;hfully; it was hardly noticeable; and, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> unnoticed, I paid my com|pliments in a deeper courte&s;y. And then, finding my hand in his, when I knew not whether I had an hand or not&mdash;I am grieved, Sir, &s;ad I, to be the occa&s;ion, to be the cau&s;e&mdash;And I &s;ighed for one rea&s;on (perhaps you can gue&s;s what that was) and blu&s;hed for two; becau&s;e I knew not what to &s;ay, nor how to look; and becau&s;e I was under obligations which I could not return.</P>
<P>He kindly &s;aved my further confu&s;ion, by making light of what had pa&s;&s;ed: And, leading me to a &s;eat, took his place by me.</P>
<P>May I a&s;k, Sir Charles?&mdash;&s;aid my cou&s;in Reeves, and &s;topt.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was too tedious, and too various, to be minutely related, Mr. Reeves. But Sir Har|grave had, by Mr. Bagenhall's de&s;ire, got his &s;hort|hand writer in a clo&s;et; and that unknown to me, till all was over. I am to have a copy of what pa&s;&s;ed. You &s;hall &s;ee it, if you plea&s;e, when it is &s;ent me. Mean time, what think you of a compromi&s;e at <HI>your</HI> expence, Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>I dare abide by every thing that Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on has &s;tipulated for me.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33">
It would be cruelty to keep a Lady in &s;u&s;pence, where doubt will give her pain, and cannot end in plea&s;ure. Sir Hargrave is re&s;olv'd to wait upon you: Are you willing to &s;ee him?</P>
<P>If, Sir, you would advi&s;e me to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>I advi&s;e nothing, Madam. Pur&s;ue your inclinati|ons. Mr. Reeves is at liberty to admit whom he plea&s;es into his Hou&s;e: Mi&s;s Byron to &s;ee in it, or where&s;oever &s;he is, whom <HI>&s;he</HI> plea&s;es. I told him my mind very freely. But I left him determined to wait on you. I have rea&s;on to believe he will behave very well. I &s;hould be &s;urpri&s;ed, if he does not in the humble&s;t manner a&s;k your pardon; and <HI>yours,</HI> Mr. Reeves, and your Lady's. But if you have any ap|prehen&s;ions, Madam (to me) I will be ready to at|tend you at five minutes notice, before he &s;hall be admitted to your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>It is very good, Sir, &s;aid Mr. Reeves, to be ready to favour Mi&s;s Byron with your countenance on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. But I hope we need not give you that trouble in this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles went away &s;oon after; and Mr. Reeves has been accu&s;ing him&s;elf ever &s;ince, with an&s;wering him too abruptly, tho' he meant nothing but the tru|e&s;t re&s;pect. And yet as I have written it, on re-per|u&s;al, I don't above half like Mr. Reeves's an&s;wer. But where high re&s;pect is entertained, grateful hearts will always, I believe, be accu&s;ing them&s;elves of imper|fections, which none other &s;ee, or can charge them with.</P>
<P>As Sir Charles is &s;afe, and I have now nothing to apprehend but Sir Hargrave's vi&s;it, I will di&s;patch this Letter, with a&s;&s;urances that I am, my dear Lucy,</P>

<P>SIR Charles had ju&s;t &s;ent the impatiently expected Paper, tran&s;cribed by the &s;hort-hand writer from his minutes of the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed on Sir Charles's intrepid vi&s;it at Sir Hargrave's. <HI>Intrepid,</HI> I call it: But had I known of it, as Mr. Reeves did, before the event, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ju&s;tified the <HI>ra&s;h|ne&s;s,</HI> I &s;hould have called it ra&s;h, and been for pro|po&s;ing to &s;end Peace-officers to Cavendi&s;h-Square, or taking &s;ome method to know whether he were &s;afe in his per&s;on; e&s;pecially when three o'clock ap|proached; and his dinner-time is earlier than that of mo&s;t other people of fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves has been &s;o good as to undertake to tran&s;cribe this long paper for me, that I may have time to give you an account of three particular vi&s;its which I have received. I a&s;ked Mr. Reeves, If it were not a &s;trange way of proceeding in this Bagenhall to have his &s;hort-hand writer, and now turned li&s;tener, always with him? He an&s;wered, It was not a u&s;ual way; but, in ca&s;es of this nature, where murder, and a tryal, were expected to follow the ra&s;hne&s;s, in a court of ju&s;tice, he thought it carried with it, tho' a face of premeditation, yet a look of fairne&s;s; and there was no doubt but the man had been in bad &s;crapes before now, and was willing to u&s;e every precaution for the future.</P>

<HEAD>The PAPER.</HEAD>
<P>On Thur&s;day morning, March the 2d, 17.. I Henry Cotes, according to notice given me the preceding evening, went to the hou&s;e of Sir Hargrave Pol|lexfen, Baronet, in Cavendi&s;h Square, about half an hour after eight in the morning, in order to take
<PB N="34" REF="35">
minutes, in &s;hort-hand, of a conver&s;ation that was expected to be held between the &s;aid Sir Hargrave Pollexfen, and Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, Baronet, upon a debate between the &s;aid Gentlemen; on which I had once before attended James Bagenhall, E&s;quire, at the Hou&s;e of the &s;aid Sir Charles Grandi&s;on in St. James Square; and from which con&s;equences were apprehended, that might make an exact ac|count of what pa&s;&s;ed, of great importance.</P>
<P>I was admitted, about nine o'clock, into the with|drawing-room; where were pre&s;ent the &s;aid Sir Hargrave, the &s;aid James Bagenhall, Solomon Mer|ceda, E&s;quire, and John Jordan, E&s;quire. And they were in full conver&s;ation about the reception that was to be given to the &s;aid Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; which not being a part of my orders or bu&s;ine&s;s, I had no command to take down; but the <HI>contrary.</HI></P>
<P>And that I might, with the le&s;s interruption, take mi|nutes of the expected conver&s;ation, I was ordered to place my&s;elf in a large clo&s;et adjoining to the &s;aid withdrawing-room, from which it was &s;eparated by a thin wain&s;cot-partition: But, le&s;t the &s;aid Sir Charles &s;hould object to the taking of the &s;aid mi|nutes, I was directed to conceal my&s;elf there till called forth; but to take the &s;aid minutes fairly and truly, as, upon occa&s;ion, I would make oath to the truth thereof.</P>
<P>About half an hour after nine o'clock, I heard Mr. Bagenhall, with an oath, that denoted, by the voice, eagerne&s;s and &s;urprize, &s;ay, Sir Charles was come. And immediately a footman enter'd, and &s;aid, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sir Charles Grandi&s;on!"</Q></P>
<P>Then three or four of the Gentlemen &s;poke together pretty loud and high: But what they &s;aid I thought not in my orders to note down. But this is not improper to note: Sir Hargrave &s;aid, Give me that pair of pi&s;tols, and let him follow me into the gar|den. By G&mdash;he &s;hall take <HI>one.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
No, no! I heard Mr. Merceda &s;ay; who being a fo|reigner, I knew his voice from the re&s;t&mdash;No, no! That mu&s;t not be.</P>
<P>And another voice, I believe by the li&s;p, it was Mr. Jordan's, &s;ay, Let us, Sir Hargrave, hear what a man &s;o gallant has to &s;ay for him&s;elf. <HI>Occa&s;ions</HI> may ari&s;e <HI>afterwards.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Bagenhall, who&s;e voice I well knew, &s;aid, D&mdash;n his blood, if an hair of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's head &s;hould be hurt on this vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Do I, d&mdash;n ye all, &s;aid Sir Hargrave, offer any thing unfair, when I would give him the choice of the pi&s;tols?</P>
<P>What! in your own garden! A pretty &s;tory, which|&s;oever drops! &s;aid Mr. Merceda. The devil's in it, if he may not be <HI>forced</HI> now to give you the &s;a|tisfaction of a gentleman el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>De&s;ire Sir Charles (D&mdash;n his blood, &s;aid Sir Hargrave) to come in. And then [as I &s;aw through a knot|hole, that I ju&s;t then, hunting for a crack in the wain&s;cot-partition, di&s;covered] Sir Charles enter|ed; and I &s;aw that he looked very &s;edate and chear|ful; and he had his &s;word by his &s;ide, though in a morning dre&s;s. And then the conver&s;ation began, as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Sir Charles.</HI> YOUR Servant, Sir Hargrave. Mr. Bagenhall, yours. Your Ser|vant, Gentlemen.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bagenhall.</HI> Yours, Sir Charles. You are a man of your word. This gentleman is Mr. Jordan, Sir Charles. This gentleman is Mr. Merceda.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Mr. Merceda!&mdash;I have heard of Mr. Mer|ceda.&mdash;I have been very free, Sir Hargrave, to invite my&s;elf to breakfa&s;t with you.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Hargrave.</HI> Yes, by G&mdash;. And &s;o you have before now. Have you any-body with you Sir?&mdash;If you have, let them walk in.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Nobody, Sir.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="37">
<HI>Sir Har.</HI> The&s;e are gentlemen, Sir. They are men of honour. They are <HI>my</HI> friends.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> They look like gentlemen. I &s;uppo&s;e every man a man of honour, till I find him other|wi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> But don't think I have them here to in|timidate&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Intimidate, Sir Hargrave! I know not what it is to be intimidated. You &s;ay, the gentlemen are your friends. I come with a view to increa&s;e, and not dimini&s;h, the number of your friends.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> "Increa&s;e the number of my friends!"&mdash;What! with one who robbed me of the only wo|man on earth that is worth having! And who, but for the unmanly advantage taken of me, had been my wife before the day was over, Sir! And yet to re&s;u&s;e me the &s;atisfaction of a gentleman, Sir!&mdash;But I hope you are now come&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> To breakfa&s;t with you, Sir Hargrave&mdash;Don't be warm. I am determined, if po&s;&s;ible, not to be provoked&mdash;But I mu&s;t not be ill-treated.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> Why, then, Sir, take one of tho&s;e two pi&s;tols. My chariot &s;hall carry us&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> No-where, Sir Hargrave. What has hi|therto pa&s;&s;ed between us, was owing to accident. It is not my way to recriminate. To your own heart, however, I appeal: That mu&s;t convince you, that the method you took to gain the Lady, rendered you un|worthy of her. I took no <HI>unmanly</HI> advantage of you. That I refu&s;ed to meet you in the way you have de|manded, gives me a title to call my&s;elf your be&s;t friend&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> "My be&s;t friend," Sir!&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Yes, Sir. If either the pre&s;ervation of your own life, or the &s;aving you a long regret for take|ing that of another, as the chance might have been, de&s;erves your con&s;ideration. In &s;hort, it depends up|on your&s;elf, Sir Hargrave, to let me know whether
<PB N="37" REF="38">
you were guilty of a bad action from mad and violent pa&s;&s;ion, or from de&s;ign, and a natural bya&s;s, if I may &s;o call it, to violence; which alone can lead you to think of ju&s;tifying one bad action by another.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> Then, Sir, account me a man of <HI>natural violence,</HI> if you plea&s;e. Who &s;hall value the opinion of a man that has di&s;gracefully&mdash;G&mdash;d'd&mdash;you, Sir&mdash;Do you &s;ee&mdash;what marks I &s;hall carry to my grave&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Were I as violent as you, Sir Hargrave, you might carry tho&s;e marks to your grave, and not wear them long.&mdash;Let us breakfa&s;t, Sir. That will give you time to cool. Were I even to do, as you would have me, you will be&s;t find your account in be|ing cool. You cannot think I would take &s;uch an advantage of you, as your pa&s;&s;ion would give me.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> Nobly &s;aid, by Heaven!&mdash;Let us break|fa&s;t, Sir Hargrave. Then you will be cooler. Then will you be fitter to di&s;cu&s;s this point, or any other.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Merceda.</HI> Very right. You have a noble enemy, Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I am no man's enemy, Mr. Merceda. Sir Hargrave &s;hould con&s;ider, that, in the occa&s;ion for all this, he was to blame; and that all my part in the af|fair was owing to accident, not malice.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jordan.</HI> I doubt not, Sir Charles, but you are ready to a&s;k pardon of Sir Hargrave, for your part&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> A&s;k pardon, Sir!&mdash;No!&mdash;I think I ought to have done ju&s;t as I did. Were it to do again, I &s;hould do it, whoever were the man.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> See there! See there!&mdash;Mr. Bagenhall, Mr. Merceda, Mr. Jordan! See there! Hear that!&mdash;Who can have patience!</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I can tell you who <HI>ought</HI> to have patience, Sir Hargrave. I &s;hould have a very mean opinion of any man here, called upon as I was, if he had not done ju&s;t as I did: And a &s;till meaner than I have of <HI>you,</HI> Sir Hargrave, had you, in the like ca&s;e, refu&s;ed
<PB N="38" REF="39">
the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a woman in di&s;tre&s;s. But I will not repeat what I have written.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> If you are a <HI>man,</HI> Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on, take your choice of one of tho&s;e pi&s;tols, G&mdash;d&mdash;n you. I in&s;i&s;t upon it.</P>
<P>And I &s;aw thro' the knot-hole, that Sir Hargrave aro&s;e in pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> As I AM a <HI>man,</HI> Sir Hargrave, I will <HI>not.</HI> It might look to an angry man like an in&s;ult, which I am above intending, were I to &s;ay, that I have given, on our fir&s;t <HI>interview,</HI> proofs that I want not courage. I give you now, as I think, the highe&s;t I <HI>can</HI> give, in refu&s;ing your challenge. A per&s;onal in&s;ult I know how to repel. I know how to defend my&s;elf&mdash;But, as I &s;aid, I will not repeat any thing I have written.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> But, Sir Charles, you have threatened a man of honour in what you have written, if we take you right, with a weapon that ought to be u&s;ed only to a &s;coundrel; yet refu&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> The man, Sir, that &s;hall take it into his head to in&s;ult me, may do it with the greater &s;afety, tho' perhaps not with impunity, as he may be a&s;&s;ured I will not kill him for it, if I can help it. I can play with my weapons, Sir (it may look like boa&s;ting); but will not play with any man's life, nor con&s;ent to make a &s;port of my own.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> D&mdash;n your coolne&s;s, Sir!&mdash;I cannot bear&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Cur&s;e not your &s;afety, Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> Indeed, Sir Charles, I could not bear &s;uch an air of &s;uperiority&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> It is <HI>more</HI> than an air, Mr. Jordan. The man who can think of ju&s;tifying one violent action by another, mu&s;t give a <HI>real</HI> &s;uperiority again&s;t him&s;elf. Let Sir Hargrave confe&s;s his fault&mdash;I have put him in the way of doing it, with all the credit to him&s;elf that a man can have who has <HI>committed</HI> a fault&mdash;and I offer him my hand.</P>

<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I intended not to do you any of this mi&s;|chief, Sir Hargrave. I drew not my &s;word, to return a pa&s;s made by yours&mdash;Actually received a raking on my &s;houlder from a &s;word that was aimed at my heart. I &s;ought nothing but to hinder you from doing that mi&s;chief to <HI>me,</HI> which I was re&s;olved not to do to <HI>you.</HI> This, Sir Hargrave, This, gentlemen, was the &s;tate of the ca&s;e; and the cau&s;e &s;uch, as no man of ho|nour could refu&s;e engaging in.&mdash;And now, Sir, I meet you, upon my own invitation, in your own hou&s;e, unattended, and alone, to &s;hew you, that I have the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition as I had from the fir&s;t, to avoid doing you injury: And <HI>this</HI> it is, gentlemen, that gives me a &s;uperiority to Sir Hargrave, which he may le&s;&s;en, by behaving as I, in his ca&s;e, would behave to him.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> By G&mdash;this is nobly &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> I own, Sir Hargrave, that I would &s;ooner veil to &s;uch a Man as this than to a King on his throne.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> D&mdash;n me, if I forgive him, with the&s;e marks about me.&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t upon your taking one of the&s;e pi&s;tols, Sir.&mdash;Gentlemen, my friends, he boa&s;ts of his advantages: He <HI>may</HI> have &s;ome from his cur&s;ed coolne&s;s: He can have none any other way. Bear witne&s;s, I forgive him, if he lodges a brace of bullets in my heart&mdash;Take one of tho&s;e pi&s;tols, Sir. They are equally loaded&mdash;Bear witne&s;s, if I die, that I have provoked my fate. But I will die like a man of ho|nour.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> To <HI>die</HI> like a man of honour, Sir Har|grave, you mu&s;t have <HI>lived</HI> like one. You &s;hould be &s;ure of your cau&s;e. But the&s;e pi&s;tols are too ready a mi&s;chief. Were I to meet you in <HI>your own</HI> way, Sir Hargrave, I &s;hould not expect, that a man &s;o enraged would fire his over <HI>my</HI> head, as I &s;hould be willing to
<PB N="40" REF="41">
do mine over <HI>his.</HI> Life I would not put upon the perhaps involuntary twitch of a finger.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> Well then, The &s;word. You came, tho' undre&s;&s;ed, with your &s;word on.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I did; and for the rea&s;on I gave to Mr. Bagenhall. I draw it not, however, but in my own defence.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> (ri&s;ing from his &s;eat) Will you favour me with your company into my own garden? Only you and I, Sir Charles. Let the gentlemen my friends &s;tay here. They &s;hall only look out of the windows, if they plea&s;e&mdash;Only to that gra&s;s-plot, Sir (pointing as I &s;aw)&mdash;If <HI>you</HI> fall, I &s;hall have the wor&s;t of it, from the looks of the matter, killing a man in my own garden: If <HI>I</HI> fall, you will have the evidence of my friends to bring you off.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I need not look at the place, Sir Hargrave. And &s;ince, gentlemen, it is allowed, that the pi&s;tols may be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and &s;ince, by their being loaded on the table, they &s;eem but to &s;timulate to mi&s;chief; you will all excu&s;e me, and you, Sir Hargrave, will for|give me&mdash;</P>
<P>And &s;o &s;aying, he aro&s;e, with great tranquillity, as I &s;aw; and taking the pi&s;tols, li&s;ted up the &s;a&s;h that was next to that at which Sir Hargrave &s;tood, and di&s;charged them both out of the window.</P>
<P>By the report, the writer is &s;ure they were well loaded.</P>
<P>In ran a croud of &s;ervants, men and women, in di&s;|may. The writer &s;at &s;till in the clo&s;et, knowing the matter to be no wor&s;e. One of the men cried out, This is the murderer! And they all (not &s;eeing their ma&s;ter, as I &s;uppo&s;e, at the window beyond Sir Charles, and who afterwards owned him&s;elf too much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;tir or &s;peak) were for making up to Sir Charles.</P>
<P>Sir Charles then retiring, put his hand upon his
<PB N="41" REF="42">
&s;word: But mildly &s;aid, My friends, your ma&s;ter is &s;afe. Take care I hurt not any of you.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> I am &s;afe&mdash;Begone, &s;coundrels!</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> Begone! Quit the room. Sir Har|grave is &s;afe.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> Begone! Begone!</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> Begone! Begone!</P>
<P>The &s;ervants, as I &s;aw, crouded out as fa&s;t as they came in.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, then &s;tepping towards Sir Hargrave, &s;aid, You will, &s;ome time hence, Sir, think the di&s;|charge of tho&s;e pi&s;tols much happier than if they had been put to the u&s;e de&s;igned when they were loaded. I offer you my hand: It is an offer that is not to be twice refu&s;ed. If you have malice to me, I have none to you. I invited my&s;elf to <HI>breakfa&s;t</HI> with you. You and your friends &s;hall be welcome to <HI>dine</HI> with me. My time is near expired (looking at his watch)&mdash;for Sir Hargrave &s;eemed too irre&s;olute either to accept or refu&s;e his hand.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> I am a&s;toni&s;hed!&mdash;Why, Sir Charles, what a tranquility mu&s;t you have within you! The devil take me, Sir Hargrave, if you &s;hall not make up matters with &s;uch a noble adver&s;ary.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> He has won me to his &s;ide. By the great God of Heaven, I had rather have Sir Charles Grandi&s;on for my friend than the greate&s;t Prince on earth!</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> Did I not <HI>tell</HI> you, gentlemen?&mdash;D&mdash;n me, if I have not hitherto lived to nothing but to my &s;hame! I had rather be Sir Charles Grandi&s;on in this one pa&s;t hour, than the Great Mogul all my life.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave even &s;obbed, as I could hear by his voice, like a child.&mdash;D&mdash;n my heart, &s;aid he, in bro|ken &s;entences&mdash;And mu&s;t I thus put up&mdash;And mu&s;t I be thus overcome? By G&mdash;, By G&mdash;, Grandi&s;on, you mu&s;t, you mu&s;t, walk down with me into the

garden. I have &s;omething to propo&s;e to you, and it will be in your own choice either to compromi&s;e, or to give me the &s;atisfaction of a gentleman: But you mu&s;t retire with me into the garden.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> With all my heart, Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>And taking oft his Sword, he laid it on the table.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> And mu&s;t I do &s;o too?&mdash;D&mdash;n me, if I do!&mdash;Take up your &s;word, Sir.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I will, to oblige you, Sir Hargrave. It will be always in my choice to draw it or not.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> D&mdash;n me, if I can live to be <HI>thus</HI> treated!&mdash;Where the devil have you been till now?&mdash;But you mu&s;t go lown with me into the garden.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Shew me the way, Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P>They all interpo&s;ed: But Sir Charles &s;aid, Pray, gentlemen, let Sir Hargrave have his way. We will attend you pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>The writer then came out, by the gentlemens leave, who &s;taid behind, at the windows. They expre&s;&s;ed their admiration of Sir Charles. And Mr. Merceda and Mr. Bagenhall (the writer mentions it to their honour) reproached each other, as if they had no notion of what was great and noble in man till now.</P>
<P>Sir Charles and Sir Hargrave &s;oon appeared in &s;ight; walking, and as conver&s;ing earne&s;tly. The &s;ubject, it &s;eems, was, &s;ome propo&s;als made by Sir Hargrave about the Lady, which Sir Charles would not comply with. And when they came to the gra&s;s|plot, Sir Hargrave threw open his coat and wai&s;tcoat, and drew; and &s;eemed, by his motions, to in&s;i&s;t upon Sir Charles's drawing likewi&s;e. Sir Charles had his &s;word in one hand; but it was undrawn: the other was &s;tuck in his &s;ide: his frock was open. Sir Har|grave &s;eemed &s;till to in&s;i&s;t upon his drawing, and put him&s;elf into a fencing attitude. Sir Charles then calmly &s;tepping towards him, put down Sir Hargrave's &s;word with his hand, and put his left-arm under Sir
<PB N="43" REF="44">
Hargrave's &s;word-arm. Sir Hargrave lifted up the other arm pa&s;&s;ionately: But Sir Charles, who was on his guard, immediately laid hold of the other arm, and &s;eemed to &s;ay &s;omething mildly to him; and let|ting go his left-hand, led him towards the hou&s;e; his drawn &s;word &s;till in his hand. Sir Hargrave &s;eemed to expo&s;tulate, and to re&s;i&s;t being led, tho' but faintly, and as a man overcome with Sir Charles's behaviour; and they both came up together, Sir Charles's arm &s;till within his &s;word-arm&mdash;[The writer retired to his fir&s;t place]. D&mdash;n me, &s;aid Sir Hargrave, as he en|ter'd the room, this man, this Sir Charles, is the devil&mdash;He has made a mere infant of me. Yet, he tells me, he will not be my friend neither, in the point my heart is &s;et upon. He threw his &s;word upon the floor. This only I will &s;ay, as I &s;aid be|low, Be my friend in that one point, and I will for|give you with all my &s;oul.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> The Lady is, mu&s;t be, her own mi&s;tre&s;s, Sir Hargrave. I have acquired no title to any influ|ence over her. She is an excellent woman. She would be a jewel in the crown of a prince. But you mu&s;t allow me to &s;ay, She mu&s;t not be terrified. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that her life has been once in danger al|ready: all the care and kindne&s;s of my &s;i&s;ter and a phy&s;ician could hardly re&s;tore her.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> The mo&s;t inflexible man, devil, I &s;hould &s;ay, I ever &s;aw in my life! But you have no objection to my &s;eeing her. She &s;hall &s;ee (yet how can I for|give you that?) what I have &s;uffered in my per&s;on for her &s;ake. If &s;he will not be mine, the&s;e marks &s;hall be <HI>hers,</HI> not <HI>yours.</HI> And tho' I will not terrify her, I will &s;ee if &s;he has no pardon, no pity for me. She knows, &s;he very well knows, that I was the mo&s;t honourable of men to her, when &s;he was in my power. By all that's &s;acred, I intended only to make her Lady Pollexfen. I &s;aw &s;he had as many Lovers as vi&s;itors, and I could not bear it.&mdash;You, Sir Charles,
<PB N="44" REF="45">
will &s;tand my friend, and if money and love will pur|cha&s;e her, &s;he &s;hall yet be mine.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I promi&s;e you no friend&s;hip in this ca&s;e, Sir Hargrave. All her <HI>relations</HI> leave her, it &s;eems, to her own di&s;cretion; and who &s;hall offer to lead her choice? What I &s;aid below, when you would have made <HI>that</HI> a condition, I repeat&mdash;I think &s;he ought <HI>not</HI> to be yours; nor ought you, either for your own &s;ake or hers, to de&s;ire it. Come, come, Sir Hargrave, con&s;ider the matter better. Think of &s;ome other woman, if you are di&s;po&s;ed to marry. Your figure&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> Yes, by G&mdash;I make a pretty figure now, don't I?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Your fortune, will make you happier in marriage with any other woman, after what has happen'd, than this <HI>can</HI> make you. For my own part, let me tell you, Sir Hargrave, I would not marry the greate&s;t prince&s;s on earth, if I thought &s;he did not love me above all other men, whether I <HI>de&s;erved</HI> her love or not.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> And you have no view to your&s;elf in the advice you give?&mdash;Tell me that&mdash;I in&s;i&s;t upon your telling me that.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Whenever I pretend to give advice, I &s;hould abhor my &s;elf, if I did not wholly con&s;ider the good of the per&s;on who con&s;ulted me; and if I had any retro&s;pection to my&s;elf, which might in the lea&s;t affect that per&s;on.</P>
<P>The breakfa&s;t was then brought in. This that follows was the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed at and after breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> See what a Chri&s;tian can do, Merceda. After this, will you remain a Jew?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> Let me &s;ee &s;uch <HI>another</HI> Chri&s;tian, and I will give you an an&s;wer. You, Bagenhall, I hope, will not think your&s;elf intitled to boa&s;t of your Chri|&s;tianity?</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="46">
<HI>Mr Bag.</HI> Too true! We have been both of us &s;ad dogs.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> And I have been the mo&s;t innocent man of the three; and yet, that's the devil of it, am the greate&s;t &s;ufferer. Cur&s;e me, if I can bear to look at my&s;elf in the gla&s;s!</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> You &s;hall be above all that, Sir Har|grave. And let me tell you, you need not be a&s;ham|ed to be overcome, as you are overcome.

<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> That's &s;ome comfort, Jordan. But, d&mdash;n me, Sir Charles, I will &s;ee the lady: And you &s;hall introduce me to her, too.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> That cannot be&mdash;What! Shall I intro|duce a gentleman to a lady, whom I think he ought no more to &s;ee, than &s;he &s;hould &s;ee him? If I thought you would go, I might if &s;he reque&s;ted it, be there, le&s;t, from what &s;he has &s;uffer'd already, &s;he &s;hould be too much terrified.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> What, Sir! You would not turn <HI>Quixote</HI> again?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> No need, Sir Hargrave. You would not again be the <HI>giant</HI> who &s;hould run away with the lady.</P>
<P>The gentlemen laughed.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> By G&mdash;, Sir you have carried your matters very triumphantly.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I mean not triumph, Sir Hargrave. But where either truth or ju&s;tice is concerned, I hope I &s;hall never palliate.</P>

<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I am &s;orry to hear you &s;ay that, Mr. Bagen|hall. Occa&s;ion calls not out every man equally.</P>

<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> When you give this matter your cool at|tention, you will find rea&s;on to rejoice, that an en|terprize begun in violence, and carried on &s;o far as you carried it, concluded not wor&s;e.

<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> You know, Sir Charles, that I would have compromi&s;ed with you below. But not one point&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Compromi&s;e, Sir Hargrave!&mdash;As I told you, I had no quarrel with <HI>you:</HI> You propo&s;ed condi|tions, which I thought &s;hould not be complied with. I aimed not to carry <HI>any</HI> point. Self-defence, I told you was the whole of my &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> You have given &s;ome hints, Sir Charles, that you have not been unu&s;ed to affairs of this kind.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I have before now met a challenger; but it was when I could not avoid it; and with the re&s;o|lution of &s;tanding only on my own defence, and in the hope of making an enemy a friend. Had I&mdash;</P>

<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> No, by my &s;oul! And how &s;hould it? You came off too triumphantly: You were not hurt: You have no <HI>mark</HI> to &s;hew. May I be cur&s;ed, if, in forgiving you, which yet I know not how to do, I do not think my &s;elf the greater hero!</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I will not conte&s;t that point with you, Sir Hargrave. There is no doubt but the man, who can &s;ubdue his pa&s;&s;ion, and forgive a <HI>real</HI> injury, is an hero.

<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> I am charmed with your &s;entiments, Sir Charles. You mu&s;t allow me the honour of your acquaintance. We all acknowledge duelling to be criminal: But no one has the courage to break through a bad cu&s;tom.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> The empty, the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> glory, that men have to be thought brave, and the apprehen&s;ion of being deemed cowards among men, and among <HI>women</HI> too, very few men aim to get above.</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> You have been challenged more than once, I pre&s;ume.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I am not a quarrel&s;ome man: But as it was early known that I made it a principle not to en|gage in a duel, I was the more &s;ubjected, I have rea|&s;on to think, for that, to inconveniencies of this na|ture.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> Had you always, Sir Charles, that mag|nanimity, that intrepidity, that &s;teadine&s;s, I know not what to call it, which we have &s;een and admire in you?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I have always con&s;idered Spirit as the di|&s;tinction of a man. My father was a man of &s;pirit. I never fear'd man, &s;ince I could write man. As I never &s;ought danger, or went out of my way to meet it, I looked upon it when it came, as an unavoidable evil, and as a call upon me for fortitude. And hence I hardly ever wanted that pre&s;ence of mind in it, which a man ought to &s;hew; and which &s;ometimes, indeed, was the means of extricating me from it.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> An in&s;tance of which this morning, I &s;up|po&s;e you think, has produced.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I had not that in my head. In Italy, in|deed, I &s;hould hardly have acted as in the in&s;tance you

I <HI>expected</HI> to meet you full of fire, full of re&s;entment: But it is hard, thought I (as &s;ome extraordinary &s;tep &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be taken) if I cannot content my&s;elf with that &s;uperiority (excu&s;e me, Sir Hargrave) which my calmne&s;s, and Sir Hargrave's pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t give me over him, or any man. My &s;word was in my power. Had I even apprehended a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, the hou&s;e of an Engli&s;h gentleman could not have been the place for it: And where a confidence was repo&s;ed.

<P>All the gentlemen be&s;ought him to give it.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Charles.</HI> In the raging of the war, now, &s;o &s;ea&s;onably for all the powers at variance, concluded, I was pa&s;&s;ing through a wood in Germany, in my way to Manheim. My &s;ervant, at &s;ome di&s;tance be|fore me, was endeavouring to find out the right road, there being more than one. He rode back affright|ed, and told me he had heard a loud cry of murder, &s;ucceeded by groans, which grew fainter and fainter, as tho&s;e of a dying per&s;on; and be&s;ought me to make the be&s;t of my way back. As I was thinking to do &s;o (tho' my way lay through the wood, and I had got more than half-way in it) I beheld &s;ix Pan|dours i&s;&s;ue from that inner part of the wood, into which, in all probability, they had dragged &s;ome un|happy pa&s;&s;enger; for I &s;aw an hor&s;e bridled and &s;ad|dled, without a rider, grazing by the road-&s;ide. They were well armed. I &s;aw no way to e&s;cape. They proba|bly knew everyavenue in and out of the wood: I did not. They &s;topped when they came within two mu&s;quet|&s;hots of me, as if they had waited to &s;ee which way I took. Two of them had dead poultry &s;lung acro&s;s their &s;houlders, which &s;hewed them to be common plun|derers,
<PB N="50" REF="51">
I took a re&s;olution to ride up to them. I bid my &s;ervant, if he &s;aw me attacked, make the be&s;t of his way for his own &s;ecurity, while they were employ|ed either in rifling or murdering me; but, if they &s;uf|fered me to pa&s;s, to follow me. He had no port|manteau to tempt them. That, and my other bag|gage, I had cau&s;ed to be &s;ent by water to Manheim&mdash;I am an Engli&s;hman, gentlemen, &s;aid I (judging, if Au&s;trians, as I &s;uppo&s;ed they were, that plea would not di&s;avail me): I am doubtful of my way. Here is a pur&s;e; holding it out. As &s;oldiers, you mu&s;t be gentlemen: It is at your &s;ervice, if one or two of you will be &s;o kind as to e&s;cort and guide me through this wood, They looked upon one another: I was loth they &s;hould have time to deliberate&mdash;I am upon bu&s;ine&s;s of great con&s;equence. Pray direct me the neare&s;t way to Manheim. Take the&s;e florins.</P>
<P>At la&s;t one that &s;eemed of authority among them, held out his hand; and taking the pur&s;e, &s;aid &s;ome|thing in Sclavonian; and two of them, with their pieces &s;lung on their &s;houlders, and their &s;abres drawn, led me out of the wood in &s;afety; but hoped, at part|ing, my farther genero&s;ity. I found a few more flo|rins for them; and they rode back into the wood; I &s;uppo&s;e to their fellows; and glad I was to come off &s;o well. Had I either &s;eemed afraid of them, or en|deavoured to e&s;cape, probably I had been lo&s;t. Two per&s;ons were afterwards found murdered in the wood; one of them, perhaps, the unhappy man whom my &s;ervant had heard cry out, and groan.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> I feel <HI>now</HI> very &s;en&s;ibly, Sir Charles, your danger and e&s;cape. Your fortitude indeed was then of &s;ervice to you.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> But, Sir Charles, methinks I &s;hall be ea&s;ier in my&s;elf, if you give me one in&s;tance of your making, before now, an enemy a friend. Have you one in point?</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="52">
<HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Stories of this nature come very ill from a man's own mouth.</P>

<P><HI>Sir Char.</HI> If you will not excu&s;e me then, I will tell you the &s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> Pray, Sir&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I had a mi&s;under&s;tanding at Venice with a young gentleman of the place. He was about twenty-two. I was a year younger&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> At the Carnival, I &s;uppo&s;e!&mdash;About a Lady, Sir Charles?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> He was the only &s;on of a noble Venetian family, who had great expectations from him. He was a youth of genius. Another noble family at Ur|bino, to which he was to be allied in marriage, had al&s;o an intere&s;t in his welfare. We had made a friend|&s;hip together at Padua. I was at Venice by his Invi|tation, and &s;tood well with all his family. He took offence again&s;t me, at the in&s;tigation of a de&s;igning relation of his; to own the truth, a Lady, as you &s;up|po&s;e, Mr. Bagenhall, his Si&s;ter. He would not allow me to defend my innocence to the face of the accu&s;er; nor yet to appeal to his father, who was a per&s;on of temper as well as &s;en&s;e. On the contrary, he up|braided me in a manner that I could hardly bear. I was re&s;olved to quit Venice; and took leave of his whole family, the Lady excepted, who would not be &s;een by me. The father and mother parted with me with regret. The young gentleman had &s;o managed, that I could not with honour appeal to them; and, at taking leave of him in their pre&s;ence, under pretence of a recommendatory Letter, he gave into my hand a written challenge. The an&s;wer I returned, after pro|te&s;ting my innocence, was to this effect: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am &s;etting out for Verona in a few hours. You know my principles; and I hope will better con&s;ider of the matter. I never, while I am ma&s;ter of my temper,

will give my&s;elf &s;o much cau&s;e of repentance to the la&s;t hour of my life, as I &s;hould have, were I to draw my Sword, to the irreparable injury of any man's family; or to run the &s;ame ri&s;que of injuring my own, and of incurring the final perdition of us both!"</Q></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> This an&s;wer rather provoked than &s;a|tisfied, I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Provocation was not my <HI>intention.</HI> I de|&s;igned only to remind him of the obligations we were both under to our re&s;pective families, and to throw in an hint of a &s;till &s;uperior con&s;ideration. It was likely to have more force in that Roman Catholic country than, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, it would in this Prote&s;tant one.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> How, how, Sir Charles did it end?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I went to Verona. He followed me thi|ther; and endeavoured to provoke me to draw. Why &s;hould I draw? &s;aid I. Will the deci&s;ion by the &s;word be <HI>certainly</HI> that of Ju&s;tice? You are in a pa&s;|&s;ion. You have no rea&s;on to doubt either my &s;kill, or my courage [On &s;uch an occa&s;ion, Gentlemen, and with &s;uch a view, a man may perhaps be allowed to give him&s;elf a little con&s;equence]: And &s;olemnly once more do I avow my innocence; and de&s;ire to be brought face to face with my accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>He raved the more for my calmne&s;s. I turned from him, with intent to leave him. He thought fit to offer me a per&s;onal in&s;ult&mdash;I now, methinks, blu&s;h to tell it&mdash;He gave me a box on the ear, to provoke me to draw&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> And <HI>did</HI> you draw, Sir?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> To be &s;ure you <HI>then</HI> drew?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jord.</HI> Pray, Sir Charles, let us know. You could not then <HI>help</HI> drawing? This was a provocation that would ju&s;tify a Saint.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> He had forgot, in that pa&s;&s;ionate moment
<PB N="53" REF="54">
that <HI>he</HI> was a gentleman. I did not remember that I was one, but I had no occa&s;ion to draw.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> What a plague&mdash;You did not cane him?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> He got well after a fortnight's lying-by.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> Damnation!</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I put him into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the lodgings I had taken for my&s;elf, and into proper and &s;afe hands. He was indeed unable for a day or two to direct for him&s;elf. I &s;ent for his friends. His &s;ervant did me ju&s;tice as to the provocation. Then it was, that I was obliged, in a Letter, to acquaint the father of a di&s;|covery I had made, which the &s;on had refu&s;ed to hear; which, with the Lady's confe&s;&s;ion, convinced them all of my innocence. His father acknowleged my moderation; as the young gentleman him&s;elf, did, de&s;iring a renewal of friend&s;hip: But as I thought the affair had gone too far for a cordial reconciliation, and knew that he would not want in&s;tigators to urge him to re&s;ent an indignity, which he had, however, brought upon him&s;elf, by a greater offered to me, I took leave of him and his friends, and revi&s;ited &s;ome of the German courts; that of Vienna in particular, where I re&s;ided &s;ome time.</P>
<P>In the mean while the young Gentleman married. His Lady, of the Altieri family, is an excellent wo|man. He had a great fortune with her. Soon after his nuptials, he let me know, that as he doubted not, if I had drawn my &s;word, I &s;hould, from his violence at the time, have had his life in my power, he could not but acknowlege that he owed all his acqui&s;itions, and the be&s;t of wives, as well as the happine&s;s of both families, with <HI>that</HI> life, to me.</P>
<P>I apply not this in&s;tance: But, Sir Hargrave, as I hope to &s;ee you married, and happy, though it can never be, I think, to Mi&s;s Byron, &s;uch generous ac|knowlegements as mi&s;become not an Italian, I &s;hall then hope from an Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
<HI>Sir Har.</HI> And had your Italian any marks left him, Sir?&mdash;Depend upon it, I &s;hall never look into a gla&s;s, but I &s;hall cur&s;e you to the very pit!</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Well, Sir Hargrave: This only I will add; That be as &s;en&s;ible as you will, and <HI>as I am,</HI> of the happy i&s;&s;ue of this untoward affair, I will never expect a compliment from you, that &s;hall tend to your aba&s;e|ment.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jord.</HI> Your hand, Sir Hardgrave, to Sir Charles.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> What! without terms?&mdash;Cur&s;e me, if I do!&mdash;But let him bring Mi&s;s Byron in his hand to me (that is the lea&s;t he can do): Then may I thank him for my wife.</P>
<P>Sir Charles made &s;ome &s;miling an&s;wer: But the writer heard it not.</P>
<P>Sir Charles would then have taken leave: But all the Gentlemen, Sir Hargrave among the re&s;t, were earne&s;t with him to &s;tay a little longer.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jor.</HI> My conver&s;ion mu&s;t be perfected, Sir Charles. This is a &s;ubject that concerns us all. <HI>We &s;hall remember every tittle of the conver&s;ation:</HI> and think of it when we do not &s;ee you.&mdash;Let me beg of you to acquaint me, how you came to differ from all other men of honour in your practice, as well as in your notions, upon this &s;ubject?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I will an&s;wer your que&s;tion, Mr. Jordan, as briefly as I can.</P>
<P>My Father, Sir, was a man of &s;pirit. He had high notions of honour, and he in&s;pired me early with the &s;ame. I had not pa&s;&s;ed my twelfth year, when he gave me a ma&s;ter to teach me, what is called the &s;ci|ence of defence. I was fond of the practice, and &s;oon obtained &s;uch a &s;kill in the weapons, as plea&s;ed both my Father and Ma&s;ter. I had &s;trength of body beyond my years: The exerci&s;e added to it. I had agility, it added to my agility: And the prai&s;es given me by
<PB N="55" REF="56">
my Father and Ma&s;ter, &s;o heighten'd my courage, that I was almo&s;t inclined to wi&s;h for a &s;ubject to exerci&s;e it upon. My Mother was an excellent woman: She had in&s;tilled into my earlie&s;t youth, almo&s;t from in|fancy, notions of moral rectitude, and the fir&s;t prin|ciples of Chri&s;tianity; now rather ridiculed than in|culcated in our youth of condition. She was ready &s;ometimes to tremble at the con&s;equences, which &s;he thought might follow from the attention which I paid (thus encouraged and applauded) to this <HI>practice;</HI> and was continually reading lectures to me upon <HI>true</HI> magnanimity, and upon the law of kindne&s;s, benevo|lence, and forgivene&s;s of injuries. Had I not lo&s;t her &s;o &s;oon as I did, I &s;hould have been a more per|fect &s;cholar than I am in the&s;e noble doctrines. As &s;he knew me to be naturally ha&s;ty, and very &s;en&s;ible of affronts; and as &s;he had ob&s;erved, as &s;he told me, that, even in the delight &s;he had brought me to take in doing good, I &s;hewed an over readine&s;s, even to ra&s;hne&s;s, which &s;he thought might lead me into errors, that would more than overbalance the good I aimed to do, &s;he redoubled her efforts to keep me right: And on this particular acquirement of a &s;kill in the ma|nagement of the weapons, &s;he frequently enforced up|on me an ob&s;ervation of Mr. Lock's; <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That young men, in their warm blood, are often forward to think they have in vain learned to fence, if they ne|ver &s;hew their &s;kill in a duel."</Q></P>
<P>This ob&s;ervation, in&s;i&s;ted upon, and inculcated, as &s;he knew how, was very &s;ea&s;onable at that time of danger. And &s;he never forgot to urge upon me, that the &s;cience I was learning, was a &s;cience properly called of <HI>defence</HI> and not of <HI>offence;</HI> at the &s;ame time endeavouring to caution me again&s;t the low company into which a dexterity at my weapons might lead me, as well as again&s;t the diver&s;ions them&s;elves exhibited at the infamous places where tho&s;e brutal people re&s;ort|ed:
<PB N="56" REF="57">
Infamous even by name<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hockley in the Hole, Bear-Garden, &amp;c.</NOTE> as well as in the nature of them.</P>
<P>From her in&s;tructions, I had an early notion, that it was much more noble to forgive an injury than to re&s;ent it: and to give a life than to take it. My Fa|ther (I honour his memory! was a man of gaiety, of munificence. He had great qualities. But my Mo|ther was my oracle. And he was always &s;o ju&s;t to her merit, as to command me to con&s;ider her as &s;uch; and the rather, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, as &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed well between the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> glory and the <HI>true;</HI> and would not have her boy a coward.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> A good beginning, by my life!</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jord.</HI> Pray proceed, Sir Charles. I am all attention.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> Ay, ay, we all li&s;ten.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> Cur&s;e him that &s;peaks next, to inter|rupt you.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> But what indelibly impre&s;&s;ed upon my heart my Mother's le&s;&s;ons, was an occurrence, which, and the con&s;equences of it, I &s;hall ever deplore. My Father, having taken leave of my Mother, on a pro|po&s;ed ab&s;ence of a few days, was, in an hour after, brought home, as it was thought <HI>mortally</HI> wounded in a duel. My Mother's &s;urpri&s;e on this occa&s;ion threw her into fits, from which &s;he never after was wholly free. And the&s;e, and the dangerous way he conti|nued in for &s;ome time, brought her into an ill &s;tate of health; broke, in &s;hort, her con&s;titution; &s;o that, in le&s;s than a twelvemonth, my Father, to his inexpre&s;|&s;ible angui&s;h of mind (continually reproaching him&s;elf on the occa&s;ion) lo&s;t the be&s;t of Wives, and my Si&s;ters and I the be&s;t of Mothers and In&s;tructors.</P>
<P>My concern for my Father, on whom I was an hourly attendant throughout the whole time of his confinement; and my being by that means a witne&s;s of what both he and my mother &s;uffered; completed
<PB N="57" REF="58">
my abhorrence of the vile practice of duelling. I went on, however, in endeavouring to make my&s;elf a ma&s;ter of the <HI>&s;cience,</HI> as it is called; and, among the other weapons, of the <HI>&s;taff;</HI> the better to enable me to avoid drawing my &s;word, and to impower me, if called to the occa&s;ion, to give, and not take, a life; and the rather, as the cu&s;tom was &s;o general, that a young man of &s;pirit and fortune, at one time or other, could hardly expect to e&s;cape a provocation of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>My Father once had a view, at the per&s;ua&s;ion of my Mother's Brother, who was a general of note and intere&s;t in the Imperial &s;ervice, and who was very fond of a military life, and of me, to make a &s;oldier of me, tho' an only &s;on; and I wanted not when a boy, a turn that way: But the di&s;gu&s;t I had conceived on the above occa&s;ion, again&s;t duelling, and the con&s;i|deration of the ab&s;urd alternative which the gentlemen of our army are under, either to accept a challenge, contrary to laws divine and human, or to be broke, if they do not (though a &s;oldier is the lea&s;t ma&s;ter of him&s;elf, or of his own life, of any man in the com|munity) made me think the Engli&s;h &s;ervice, tho' that of my country, the lea&s;t eligible of all &s;ervices. And for a man, who was born to &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;take in it, to devote him&s;elf to another, as my Uncle had done, from principles which I approved not, I could not but he&s;itate on the propo&s;al, young as I was. As it &s;oon became a maxim with me, not to engage, even in a national cau&s;e, without examining the ju&s;tice of it, it will be the le&s;s wonder'd at, that I could not think of any foreign &s;ervice.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> Then you have never &s;een &s;ervice, Sir Charles?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Yes, I made one campaign as a volun|teer, notwith&s;tanding what I have &s;aid. I was then in the mid&s;t of marching armies, and could not tell how to abate the ardor tho&s;e martial movements had
<PB N="58" REF="59">
rai&s;ed in my brea&s;t. But, unle&s;s my country were to be unju&s;tly invaded by a foreign enemy, I think I would not, on any con&s;ideration, be drawn into the field again.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jord.</HI> But you lead from the point, Mr. Ba|genhall: Sir Charles was going to &s;ay &s;omewhat more on the &s;ubject of duelling.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> When I was thus unhappily deprived of my Mother, my Father, in order to abate my grief [I was very much grieved] was plea&s;ed to con&s;ent to my going abroad, in order to make the Grand Tour, as it is called; having fir&s;t vi&s;ited all the Briti&s;h do|minions in Europe, Gibraltar and Minorca excepted. I then &s;uppo&s;ing I might fall into circum&s;tances that might affect the principles my mother had been &s;o careful to in&s;til into me, and to which my father's danger, and her death, had added force, it was na|tural for me to look into hi&s;tory, for the ri&s;e and pro|gre&s;s of a cu&s;tom &s;o much and &s;o ju&s;tly my aver&s;ion; and which was &s;o contrary to all laws divine and hu|man, and particularly to that true heroi&s;m which Chri&s;tianity enjoins, when it recommends meekne&s;s, moderation, and humility, as the glory of the human nature. But I am running into length.</P>
<P>Again Sir Charles took out his watch. They were clamorous for him to proceed.</P>
<P>When I found, continued he, that this unchri&s;tian cu&s;tom owed its ri&s;e to the barbarous northern nations, who had, however, &s;ome plea to make in excu&s;e, which <HI>we</HI> have not, as they were governed by parti|cular lords, and were not united under <HI>one</HI> head or government, to which, as to a la&s;t re&s;ort, per&s;ons &s;up|po&s;ing them&s;elves aggrieved, might appeal for legal redre&s;s; and that the&s;e barbarous nations were <HI>truly</HI> barbarous, and enemies to all politene&s;s; my rea&s;on|ing on this occa&s;ion added new force to prejudices &s;o well founded.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="60">
The gentlemen &s;eemed afraid, that Sir Charles had done &s;peaking. They begged he would go on.</P>
<P>I then had recour&s;e, proceeded he, to the hi&s;tories of nations famous for their courage. That of the Romans, who by that quality obtained the empire of the world, was my fir&s;t &s;ubject. I found not any traces in their hi&s;tory, which could countenance the &s;a age cu&s;tom. When a di&s;pute happen'd, the chal|lenge from both parties generally was, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That each &s;hould appear at the head of the army the next en|gagement, and give proofs of his intrepidity again&s;t the common foe."</Q> The in&s;tance of the <HI>Horatii</HI> and <HI>Curiatii,</HI> which was a <HI>publick,</HI> a <HI>national</HI> combat, as I may call it, affords not an exception to my ob|&s;ervation. And yet even <HI>that,</HI> in the <HI>early ages</HI> of Rome, &s;tands condemned by a better example. For we read, that Tullus challenged Albanus, general of the Albans, to put the cau&s;e of the two nations upon the valour of each captain's arm, for the &s;ake of &s;paring a greater e&s;&s;u&s;ion of blood. But what was the an&s;wer of Albanus, tho' the inducement to the challenge was &s;o plau&s;ible? <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That the cau&s;e was a publick, not a private one; and the deci&s;ion lay up|on the two cities of Alba and Rome."</Q></P>
<P>Many ages afterwards, Augu&s;tus received a chal|lenge from Mark Antony. Who, gentlemen, thought of branding as a coward that prince, on his an&s;wering, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if Antony were weary of his life, he night find many <HI>other</HI> ways to end it than by <HI>his</HI> &s;word?"</Q></P>
<P>Metellus, before that, challenged by Sertorius, an&s;wer'd with his pen, not his &s;word, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That it was not for a captain to die the death of a common &s;oldier."</Q></P>
<P>The very Turks know nothing of this &s;avage cu&s;|tom: And they are a nation that rai&s;ed them&s;elves by their bravery from the mo&s;t ob&s;cure beginnings in|to one of the greate&s;t empires on the globe, at this day. They take occa&s;ion to exalt them&s;elves above
<PB N="60" REF="61">
Chri&s;tians, in this very in&s;tance; and think it a &s;can|dal upon Mu&s;&s;ulmans to quarrel, and endeavour to wreak their private vengeance on one another.</P>
<P>All the Chri&s;tian doctrines, as I have hinted, are in point again&s;t it. But it is dreadful to reflect, that the man who would endeavour to &s;upport his argu|ments again&s;t this infamous practice of duelling, by the Laws of Chri&s;tianity, tho' the mo&s;t excellent of all Laws [Excu&s;e me, Mr. Merceda, your own are <HI>in|cluded</HI> in them] would &s;ubject him&s;elf to the ridicule of per&s;ons who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. I have mentioned therefore Heathens and Mahometans; tho' in this company, perhaps&mdash;But I hope I need not, however, remind any-body here, That that one doctrine of returning <HI>good</HI> for <HI>evil,</HI> is a nobler and more heroic doctrine than <HI>either</HI> of tho&s;e people, or your <HI>own,</HI> Mr. Merceda, ever knew.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jord.</HI> You have &s;hewn it, Sir Charles, by ex|ample, by practice, to be &s;o. I never &s;aw an hero till now.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> One <HI>modern</HI> in&s;tance, however, of a chal|lenge refu&s;ed, I recollect, and which may be given, by way of <HI>inference,</HI> at lea&s;t, to the advantage of my argument. The army of the famous Mare&s;chal Tu|renne, in revenge for injuries more than ho&s;tile, as was pretended, had committed terrible depredations in the Palatinate. The Elector, incen&s;ed at the un|&s;oldierly de&s;truction, challenged the Mare&s;chal to a &s;ingle combat. The Mare&s;chal's an&s;wer was to this effect: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That if the tru&s;t which the King his ma&s;ter had repo&s;ed in him, would permit him to accept of his challenge, he would not refu&s;e it; but on the contrary, would deem it an honour to mea&s;ure his arms with tho&s;e of &s;o illu&s;trious a Prince: But that, for the &s;ake of his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, he mu&s;t be excu&s;ed."</Q></P>
<P>Now, tho' I think the Mare&s;chal might have re|turned a &s;till better an&s;wer (tho' this was not a bad
<PB N="61" REF="62">
one for a military man); yet where we can, as Chri|&s;tians and as Men, plead the Divine Laws, and have not, when we meet, as private &s;ubjects, the Ma|re&s;chal's, nor even the <HI>Goths</HI> excu&s;e, I think the ex|ample worthy con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>And if, gentlemen, I <HI>have</HI> argued before now, or &s;hould I hereafter argue, as follows, to a challenger, &s;hall I de&s;erve either to branded or in&s;ulted?</P>
<P>"Of what u&s;e are the Laws of &s;ociety, if magi|&s;tracy may be thus defied? Were I to accept of your challenge, and were you to prevail again&s;t me, who is to challenge you; and if you fall, who him, by who&s;e &s;word you peri&s;h? Where, in &s;hort, is the evil to &s;top? But I will not meet you: My &s;y&s;tem is &s;elf-defence and &s;elf-defence only. Put me upon <HI>that,</HI> and I que&s;tion not but you will have cau&s;e to repent it. A <HI>premeditated</HI> revenge is that which I will not meet you to gratify. I will not dare to ri&s;que the ru&s;hing into my Maker's pre&s;ence from the con&s;equences of an act, which cannot, in the man that falls, admit of repentance, and leaves for the &s;urvivor's portion nothing but bitter remor&s;e. I fear not any more the reproaches of men, than your in&s;ults on this occa&s;ion. Be the latter offered to me at your <HI>peril.</HI> It is perhaps as happy for you as for my&s;elf, that I have a fear of an higher nature. Be the event what it will, the te&s;t you would provoke me to, can decide nothing as to the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e on either &s;ide. Already you will find me di&s;po&s;ed to do you the ju&s;tice you pre|tend to &s;eek. For your own &s;ake, therefore, con&s;i|der better of the matter; &s;ince it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but, were we to meet, and both &s;urvive, you may exchange, what you will think, a real di&s;grace for an imaginary one."</P>
<P>And thus, gentlemen, have I almo&s;t &s;yllogi&s;tically argued with my&s;elf on this &s;ubject:</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="63">
Courage is a virtue;</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion is a vice:</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ion, therefore, cannot be Courage.</P>
<P>Does it not then behove every man of true honour to &s;hew, that rea&s;on has a greater &s;hare than re|&s;entment in the boldne&s;s of his re&s;olves?</P>
<P>And what, by any degree, is <HI>&s;o</HI> rea&s;onable as a re|gard to our duty?</P>
<P>You called upon me, gentlemen, to communicate my notions on this important &s;ubject. I have the more willingly obeyed you, as I hope Sir Hargrave, on the occa&s;ion that brought us to this not unhappy breakfa&s;ting, will be the better &s;atisfied that it has &s;o ended; and as, if you are &s;o good as to adopt them, they may be of &s;ervice to others of your friends, in ca&s;e of debates among them. Indeed, for my own &s;ake, I have always been ready to communicate my notions on this head, in hopes &s;ometimes to be &s;pared provocation; for, as I have owned, I am pa&s;&s;ionate: I have pride: And am often afraid of my&s;elf; and the more, becau&s;e I am not naturally, I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, a timid man.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> 'Fore God, Sir Hargrave, &s;omebody has e&s;caped a &s;couring, as the &s;aying is.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> Aye, by my life, Sir Hargrave, you had like to have caught a Tartar.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch. The race is not always to the &s;wift,</HI> gentle|men. Sir Hargrave's pa&s;&s;ion would, doubtle&s;s, have laid him under di&s;advantage. Defence is guarded: Offence expo&s;es it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> But, Sir Charles, you de&s;pi&s;e no man, I am &s;ure, for differing from you in opinion. I am a Catholic&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> A <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic&mdash;No religion teaches a man evil. I honour <HI>every man</HI> who lives up to what he profe&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> But that is not the ca&s;e with me, I doubt.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">
<HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> That is <HI>out</HI> of doubt, Bagenhall.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jord.</HI> The truth is, Mr. Bagenhall has found his conveniencies in changing. He was brought up a Prote&s;tant. The&s;e <HI>di&s;pen&s;ations,</HI> Mr. Bagenhall!&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> Ay, and they were often an argument in Bagenhall's mouth, for making me his pro&s;elyte.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Mr. Bagenhall, I perceive, is rather of the religion of the <HI>ourt,</HI> than of that of the <HI>Church</HI> of Rome.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> But what I mean by telling you I am a Catholic, is this: I have read the opinion of &s;ome of our famous Ca&s;ui&s;ts, that, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a private man may become his own avenger, and challenge an enemy into the field.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch. Bannes</HI> and <HI>Cajetan,</HI> you mean; one a Spaniard, the other an Italian. But the highe&s;t autho|rity of your Church is full again&s;t them in this point. The Council of Trent treats the combatants who fall, as &s;elf-murderers, and denies them Chri&s;tian burial. It brands them, and all tho&s;e who by their pre&s;ence countenance and abet this &s;hocking and unchri&s;tian practice, with perpetual infamy; and condemns them to the lo&s;s of goods and e&s;tates. And furthermore, it deprives, <HI>ip&s;o jure,</HI> all tho&s;e &s;overeign princes, who &s;uffer &s;uch acts of violence to be perpetrated with im|punity in the lands and cities which they hold of the Church, of all the territories &s;o held. I need not add to this, that Lewis the XIVth's edict again&s;t duelling was the greate&s;t glory of his reign. And permit me to conclude with ob&s;erving, that the ba&s;e arts of poi|&s;oning, by the means of treacherous agents, and the cowardly practice of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination by bravoes hired on purpo&s;e to wreak a private revenge, &s;o frequent in Italy, are natural <HI>branches</HI> of this old <HI>Gothic tree.</HI> And yet (as I have before hinted) the barbarous northern na|tions had pleas to make in behalf of duelling, from <HI>their</HI> polity, which we have not from <HI>ours;</HI> Chri&s;tia|nity out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="65">
The gentlemen &s;aid, they would very &s;eriou&s;ly re|flect upon all that had pa&s;&s;ed in this uncommon con|ver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> Well, but, Sir Charles, I mu&s;t recur to my old note&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;She mu&s;t be mine. And I hope you will not &s;tand in my way.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> The Lady is her own mi&s;tre&s;s. I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee any and all of you, gentlemen, at St. James's Square.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> One thing I believe it is proper to men|tion to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. You know, Sir, that I brought a young man to your hou&s;e, to take mi|nutes of the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between you and me there, in apprehen&s;ion of con&s;equences. In <HI>like</HI> apprehen&s;ions, I prevailed upon Sir Hargrave&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> And now, Bagenhall, I could cur&s;e you for it. The affair&mdash;confound it!&mdash;that I meant to be recorded for my own ju&s;tification, has turned out to his honour. Now am I down in black and white, for a tame&mdash;fool.&mdash;Is it not &s;o?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jord.</HI> By no means. If you think &s;o, Sir Hargrave, you have but ill profited by Sir Charles's noble &s;entiments.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Cha.</HI> How is this, Mr. Bagenhall?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> I prevailed upon Sir Hargrave to have the &s;ame young man, who is hone&s;t, di&s;creet, and one of the &s;wifte&s;t &s;hort-hand writers of the age, to take a faithful account of ever-thing that has pa&s;&s;ed; and he is in that clo&s;et.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay, this is very extraordinary&mdash;But as I always &s;peak what I think, if I am not afraid of my own recollection, I need not of any man's mi|nutes.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> You need not in this ca&s;e, Sir Charles. Nothing has pa&s;&s;ed, as Sir Hargrave ob&s;erves, but what makes for your honour. We that &s;et him to work, have more need to be afraid than you. We
<PB N="65" REF="66">
bid him be hone&s;t, and not &s;pare any of us. We little thought matters would have ended &s;o amicably.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Jord.</HI> Thank God they have!</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Mer.</HI> A very happy ending, I think!</P>
<P><HI>Sir Har.</HI> Not except Mi&s;s Byron con&s;ents to wipe out the&s;e marks.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Bag.</HI> Mr. Cotes, your ta&s;k is over. Pray &s;tep in with what you have done.</P>
<P>The writer obeyed. Mr. Bagenhall a&s;ked, If the mi|nutes &s;hould be read? Sir Hargrave &s;wore No; ex|cept, as he &s;aid, he had made a better figure in the debate. Sir Charles told them, he could not &s;tay to hear them: But that, as they <HI>were</HI> written, and as he had been allowed before a copy of what pa&s;|&s;ed between him and Mr. Bagenhall, he &s;hould be glad to have one now; and the rather, as Sir Har|grave &s;hould have an in&s;tance, after he had peru&s;ed it, of his readine&s;s to condemn him&s;elf, if he found he had been wanting either to his own character, or to that of any man pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>They con&s;ented, that I &s;hould &s;end Sir Charles the fir&s;t fair copy. Sir Charles then took his leave.</P>
<P>The gentlemen all &s;tood &s;ilent for &s;everal minutes, when they returned from attending him to the door, looking upon ane another as if each expected the other to &s;peak: But when they &s;poke, it was all in prai&s;e of Sir Charles, as the mo&s;t mode&s;t, the mo&s;t polite, the brave&s;t, and noble&s;t of men. Yet his maxims, they &s;aid, were confoundedly &s;trange; im|practicable for &s;uch &s;orry dogs as them (that was their phra&s;e) to practi&s;e.</P>
<P>But Sir Hargrave &s;eemed greatly di&s;turbed and deject|ed. He could not, he &s;aid, &s;upport him&s;elf under the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own inferiority. But what could I do? &s;aid he. The <HI>devil</HI> could not have made him fight. Plague take him! he beat me out of my play.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67">
And yet, &s;aid Mr. Merceda, a tilting-bout &s;eems no more to him than a game at pu&s;hpin.</P>
<P>You would have thought &s;o, &s;aid Sir Hargrave, had you ob&s;erved with what a &s;leight, and with what un|concernedne&s;s, he pu&s;hed down my drawn &s;word with his hand (tho' he would grant me nothing) and took me under the arm, and led me in to you, as tho' he had taken me pri&s;oner. The devil has long, continued he, owed me a &s;hame: But who would have thought he had &s;o much power over Sir Char|les Grandi&s;on, as to get him to pay it me? But, however, I never will be ea&s;y till Mi&s;s Byron is Lady Pollexfen.</P>
<P>I take leave, honoured Sir, to ob&s;erve, that a few things are noted in this copy, which, to avoid giving of|fence, will not be in that I &s;hall write for the gentle|men.

<HEAD>Continuation of Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON'S</HI> Letter.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a pacquet, including the &s;hort-hand wri|ter's paper, tran&s;cribed by my cou&s;in Reeves, &s;hall I &s;end you this time! I will not &s;well it by re|flections on that paper; that would be endle&s;s; but ha&s;ten to give you &s;ome account of the vi&s;its I men|tioned.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave Pollexfen came, without any notice, about nine o' clock.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="68">
My heart &s;unk, whan his chair &s;topt at the door, and I was told who was in it.</P>
<P>He was &s;hewn into the great parlour. My cou&s;in Reeves's &s;oon attended him. He made great apologies to them (and &s;o Mr. Reeves &s;aid he ought) for the di&s;turbance he had given them.</P>
<P>He laid all to Love&mdash;Pro&s;tituted name! made to cover all acts of violence, indi&s;cretion, folly, in both &s;exes!</P>
<P>I was in my own apartment. Mrs. Reeves came up to me. She found me in terror; and went down and told him &s;o; and begged, that he would not in|&s;i&s;t upon &s;eeing me.</P>
<P>The whole intent of this vi&s;it, he &s;aid, was to beg me to forgive him. It was probable, that I &s;hould have the &s;ame emotion upon his fir&s;t vi&s;it at any other time; and he entreated the favour of &s;eeing me. He had a <HI>right,</HI> he &s;aid, to &s;ee me; He was a &s;ufferer for my &s;ake. They &s;aw, he told them, that he was not the man he had <HI>been;</HI> and as he had been denied, and been brought to deny him&s;elf, the &s;atisfaction due to a gentleman, from a man whom he had never offended, he in&s;i&s;ted on having the opportunity given him of &s;eeing me, and receiving my forgivene&s;s, as what would con&s;olidate his reconciliation with Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>There was no re&s;i&s;ting this plea.</P>
<P>And down I <HI>trembled;</HI> I can hardly &s;ay walked.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all my little rea&s;oning with my&s;elf, to behave with the dignity of an injured per&s;on; yet the moment I &s;aw him approach me, at my entrance into the parlour, I ran to Mr. Reeves, and caught hold of his arm, with looks, I doubt not, of terror. Had Sir Charles Grandi&s;on been there, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould have run to him in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Ever-dear and adorable goodne&s;s! (were his words, coming to me) how &s;weet is this terror, and how ju&s;t!
<PB N="68" REF="69">
<HI>I</HI> have forgiven wor&s;e injuries, pointing to his mouth, I meant nothing but honour to <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Honour,</HI> Sir! Cruelty, Sir! Barbarity, Sir! How can you wi&s;h to &s;ee the creature whom you &s;o wicked|ly treated?</P>
<P>I appeal to your&s;elf, Madam, if I offered the lea&s;t indecency!&mdash;For all I have &s;uffered by my mad en|terprize, what but di&s;grace&mdash;</P>
<P>Di&s;grace, Sir, was your portion, Sir (half out of breath)&mdash;What would you, Sir?&mdash;Why this vi&s;it? What am I to do?</P>
<P>I hardly knew what I &s;aid; and &s;till I held Mr. Reeves's arm.</P>
<P>Forgive me, Madam: That is what you are to do: Pardon me: On my knee I beg your pardon. And he dropt down on one knee.</P>
<P>Kneel not to me, Sir&mdash;Pray do not kneel&mdash;You brui&s;ed, you hurt, you terrified me, Sir&mdash;And, Lord ble&s;s me! I was in danger of being your <HI>wife,</HI> Sir!</P>
<P>Was not this la&s;t part of my an&s;wer a very odd one: But the memory of what I &s;uffered at the time, and of the narrow e&s;cape I had, left me not the lea&s;t pre|&s;ence of mind, on his addre&s;s to me, kneeling.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e. <HI>In danger of being my wife,</HI> Madam! Only that the method I took was wrong, Madam!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron, you &s;ee, is in terror, Sir Hargrave.&mdash;Sit down, my love (taking my hand, and leading me to the fire-&s;ide) How you tremble, my dear!&mdash;You &s;ee, Sir Hargrave, the terror my cou&s;in is in&mdash;You &s;ee&mdash;</P>
<P>I do&mdash;I do; and am &s;orry for the occa&s;ion.&mdash;We will all &s;it down. Compo&s;e your&s;elf, dear Mi&s;s By|ron&mdash;And (holding up his cla&s;ped hands to me) I be&s;eech you, forgive me.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, I forgive you&mdash;I forgive you, Sir.</P>
<P>Were you not in &s;o much di&s;order, Madam&mdash;Were it to be &s;ea&s;onable now&mdash;I would tell you what I have further to beg. I would&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="70">
Speak, Sir, now; and never let me&mdash;</P>
<P>Suffer an interruption, Madam&mdash;I am too appre|hen&s;ive of that word <HI>never.</HI> You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> allow of my addre&s;s. I a&s;k you not any favour, but as I &s;hall be|have my&s;elf in future.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, Sir, your behaviour&mdash;But, Sir, were you to become the be&s;t man in the world, this, this, is the la&s;t time that I ever&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear Mi&s;s Byron! And then he pleaded his pa&s;|&s;ion; his fortune; his <HI>&s;ufferings.</HI>&mdash;A wretch! [Yet I had now-and-then a little pity for his disfigured mouth and lip]&mdash;His re&s;olutions to be governed by me in every act of his life&mdash;The &s;ettlement of one half of his e&s;tate upon me.&mdash;The <HI>odious</HI> wretch men|tioned <HI>children,</HI> my dear&mdash;<HI>younger</HI> children.

<P>Upon my ab&s;olutely renouncing him, he a&s;ked me, If Sir Charles Grandi&s;on had not made an impre&s;&s;ion on my heart?</P>
<P>What, Lucy, could make me inwardly fret at this que&s;tion? I could hardly have patience to reply. I now &s;ee, my dear, that I have indeed a great deal of pride.</P>
<P>Surely, Sir Hargrave, I am not accountable to you&mdash;</P>
<P>You are not, Madam: But I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion. If Sir Charles Grandi&s;on has made an application to you for favour, I can have no hope.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, Sir, is ab&s;olutely di&s;inte|re&s;ted. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on has made&mdash;There I &s;topt; I could not help it.</P>
<P>No application to my cou&s;in, I a&s;&s;ure you, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid Mr. Reeves. He is the noble&s;t of men. Had he any &s;uch thoughts, I dare &s;ay, he would be under difficulties to break his mind, le&s;t &s;uch a

declaration &s;hould be thought to le&s;&s;en the merit of his protection.</P>
<P>A good thought of Mr. Reeves. And who knows, my Lucy, but there may be &s;ome foundation for it?</P>
<P><HI>Protection!</HI> D&mdash;n it!&mdash;But I am the <HI>ea&s;ier</HI> upon this a&s;&s;urance. Let me tell you, Mr. Reeves, that, had I not &s;ound him to be a wonder of a man, mat|ters &s;hould not have ended as they &s;eem at pre&s;ent to have done.</P>
<P>But, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid Mrs. Reeves, permit me to &s;ay, as I know Mi&s;s Byron's mind, that there can|not be the lea&s;t room to imagine that Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear Mrs. Reeves, forgive me. But I cannot re|ceive a denial from any other mouth than hers. Is there no room for a &s;incere penitent to hope for mercy from a &s;weetne&s;s &s;o angelic, and who is ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged?</P>
<P>You have had <HI>mine</HI> already, Sir Hargrave, &s;aid I. I am amaz'd, that, knowing my mind <HI>before</HI> your wicked in&s;ult upon me, you &s;hould have any expecta|tion of this kind <HI>after</HI> it.</P>
<P>He again vowed his pa&s;&s;ion and &s;uch &s;tuff.</P>
<P>I think, Lucy, I never &s;hall be able, for the future, to hear with patience any man talk of love, of pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Let me &s;ummarily add, for I am tired of the &s;ub|ject, that he &s;aid an hundred impertinent things, &s;illier than any of tho&s;e &s;aid by Mr. Grandi&s;on, in my prai&s;e [indeed every-thing of this nature now appears &s;illy to me]&mdash;He in&s;i&s;ted upon a preference to Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick, Mr. Orme.&mdash;He re&s;olved not to de|&s;pair, as his &s;ufferings for my &s;ake had given him (as he &s;aid he pre&s;umed to hope) &s;ome merit in his own opinion, if not in mine; and as his forgivene&s;s of the man who had injured him, ought, he thought, to have &s;ome weight in his favour.</P>
<P>He took leave of my cou&s;ins and me in a very re|&s;pectful
<PB N="71" REF="72">
manner. I wi&s;h him no harm. But I hope I &s;hall never &s;ee him again.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March 3.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Had not recovered my&s;elf after Sir Hargrave's vi&s;it, when Lady L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on called, as they &s;aid for a moment; however this agreeable moment la&s;ted two hours. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, the in&s;tant &s;he &s;aw me, challenged me&mdash;Hey day! What's the matter with our Harriet, Mrs. Reeves? And, patting my neck, Why the&s;e flutters, child?&mdash;Perturbations delightful, or undelightful, Harriet, whether?</P>
<P>I told her who had been here, and but ju&s;t left me; and, by the help of my cou&s;ins, gave them the parti|culars of what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>They were greatly plea&s;ed; and the more, they &s;aid, as their brother, on &s;eeing them unea&s;y, had ac|quainted them, that all matters between him and Sir Hargrave were accommodated; but had not had op|portunity to tell them more.</P>
<P>Let me reckon with you, Harriet, &s;aid Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on (taking my hand with a &s;chooling air): I am half-jealous of you: Lady L. has got the &s;tart of me in my brother's affections: But &s;he is my elder &s;i&s;ter; fir&s;t come, fir&s;t &s;erved. I can bear that; but I will not be cut out by a younger &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>What is now to follow? thought I; and flutter'd like a fool! the more for her arch look, as if &s;he would read my heart in my eyes.</P>
<P>Increa&s;ed palpitation (O the fool!) made it look as
<PB N="72" REF="73">
if I took her je&s;t for earne&s;t. What a &s;ituation am I in!</P>
<P>Dear Charlotte, &s;aid Lady L. &s;miling, you &s;hall not thus perplex our &s;weet &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;My dear, don't mind her. You'll know her better in time.</P>
<P>Be quiet, Lady L. I &s;hall have it all out.</P>
<P>All what out? &s;aid I. O Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, how you love to alarm!</P>
<P>Well, well, I'll examine farther into the&s;e pertur|bations another time. I have beat the bu&s;h before now for one hare, and out have popt two But all I mean is; a paper, a letter (my brother called it a pa|per) was brought to him &s;ealed up. He rewarded the bringer; but &s;ent it directly away, unopened (that we found out) to you Harriet. Now, child, if I allow of <HI>his</HI> re&s;erves, I will not allow of <HI>yours.</HI> Pray an&s;wer me fairly and truly; What are the contents of that paper?</P>
<P>They give the particulars of the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed in the alarming interview between Sir Charles&mdash;</P>
<P>And Sir Hargrave. That's my good girl. You &s;ee, Lady L. how this young thief will &s;teal away the af|fections of our brother from us both. He has &s;hewed <HI>us</HI> nothing of this. But if you would not have me jealous, Harriet, be &s;ure keep no one &s;ecret of your heart from me&mdash;</P>
<P>That relates merely to my&s;elf, I think I will not.</P>
<P>Then you'll be a good girl: And I'll give my love for you the reins, without a pull back.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then a &s;ervant came in with a card.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lady D's compliments to Mrs. Reeves and Mi&s;s Byron; and if it would be agreeable, &s;he will wait on them pre&s;ently, for one quarter of an hour. She is obliged to go out of town early in the morning."</Q></P>
<P>What &s;hall I do now? &s;aid I. I was in a flutter; not being fully recovered from that into which Sir Hargrave's vi&s;it had thrown me.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
What now?&mdash;What now? &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. Ah! Harriet, we &s;hall find you out by degrees.</P>
<P>By the way, Lucy, you are fond of plays; and it is come into my head, that, to avoid all <HI>&s;ays-I's</HI> and <HI>&s;ays-&s;he's,</HI> I will henceforth, in all Dialogues, write names in the margin: So fan&s;y, my dear, that you are reading in one of your favourite volumes.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Do you know Lady D.?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Very well: But I did not know that you did, Harriet.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> And I know &s;he has a &s;on: and I know &s;he wants him to marry.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> That I may keep no &s;ecrets from my two &s;i&s;ters, my aunt Selby has written to me&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Lately?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Very lately.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> O! becau&s;e you had not told me of that.</P>
<P><HI>Mrs. Reeves.</HI> And pray, Ladies, what is Lady D.'s character?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> She is a very good woman. She is a &s;en|&s;ible and prudent woman.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I am not very intimate with her: But have &s;een her in two or three of my vi&s;its. I have always thought her &s;o.&mdash;And pray, Harriet, don't you want to know what character my <HI>Lord</HI> bears.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> My Lord is nothing to me. I <HI>have</HI> an|&s;wered. I have given my negative.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> The duce you have!&mdash;Why, the man has a good 12,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I don't care.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> What a duce ails the girl!</P>
<P>Then humourou&s;ly telling on her fingers&mdash;ORME, <HI>one;</HI> FENWICK, <HI>two;</HI> GREVILLE, <HI>three;</HI> FOWLER, <HI>four</HI>&mdash;I want another finger; but I'll take in my thumb&mdash;SIR HARGRAVE, <HI>five</HI>&mdash;And now (putting the forefinger of one hand on the thumb of the other)

LORD D. <HI>&s;ix!</HI>&mdash;And none of them the man!&mdash;De|pend upon it, girl, pride will have a fall.</P>
<P>What could &s;he mean by that?&mdash;Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on's &s;i&s;ters, I hope, will not&mdash;But I believe &s;he meant nothing.</P>
<P>Have I pride, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on? coldly and gravely, as my cou&s;in ob&s;erved to me afterwards, a&s;ked I.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Have you pride?&mdash;Yes that you have; or you have <HI>wor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>What could <HI>this</HI> mad <HI>Lady</HI> mean by this?&mdash;And what could <HI>I</HI> mean? For I had tears in my eyes. I was very low-&s;pirited at that moment.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Well, but, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;hall we be im|pertinent, if we &s;tay to &s;ee the Lady?&mdash;I have a great value for her. She has been an admirable executrix and tru&s;tee for her &s;on; and was as good a wife. I was ju&s;t going: but will &s;tay to pay my compliments to her, as &s;he goes out of town to-morrow. We can withdraw till you have had your talk.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Does &s;he come to per&s;uade you, Harriet, to retract your refu&s;al?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I know not her bu&s;ine&s;s. I wrote my mind to my aunt Selby. But I believe my aunt could not have written, and the counte&s;s received what &s;he wrote, by this time. But do not go: We can have no private talk.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Well, but now I will tell you, without puni&s;hing your curio&s;ity farther, what Lord D.'s cha|racter is.

<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I wi&s;h, my dear, you would not talk to me of the&s;e men. I am &s;ick of them all&mdash;Sir Har|grave has cured me&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You fib, my dear&mdash;But did you ever &s;ee Lord D.?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> No, indeed!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> "No, indeed!"&mdash;Why then you are a &s;impleton, child.

<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> And I wi&s;h, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, with all my heart, if that would tame you, that you were in love over head and ears, and could not help it!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> And wi&s;h you me that for &s;pite, or to plea&s;e me?&mdash;I <HI>am</HI> in love, my dear; and nothing keeps me in countenance, but having company among the grave ones.

back, to be cut into three-halves, as the Iri&s;hman &s;aid; that is, into two half-&s;ighs, and a hem; and a "Get you gone, for an impertinent."&mdash;As much as to &s;ay, "You have it!"&mdash;And when I found I <HI>had,</HI> and &s;he own'd it; why then I put my mad head to her grave one; and we had but one heart betwixt us.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> (laughing)&mdash;Out of breath, Charlotte, I hope.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Not yet.&mdash;How often have I kept watch and ward for her! &s;ometimes have I lent her my dre&s;&s;ing-room for their love-meetings: Yet, for the world, &s;he would not marry without her papa's con|&s;ent: No, but like the re&s;t of us, &s;he would &s;uffer her affections to be <HI>engaged,</HI> without letting him know a &s;yllable of the matter.&mdash;Very true, Lady L. what &s;ignifies looking &s;erious?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Strange creature!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Once or twice did I change dre&s;&s;es with her. In &s;hort, I was a perfect Abigail to her in the affair: And, let me tell you, two &s;i&s;ters, agreed to manage a love-affair, have advantages over even a Lady and her woman.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Mad creature!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> All this I did for her without fee or re|ward; only from the dear delight of promoting the good work, and upon the chri&s;tian principle of Do as you would be done by.&mdash;Is not all this true, Lady L.? Deny it if you can.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> And have you done, Charlotte? Ah! my dear Mi&s;s Byron, you'll never do any thing with this girl, except you hear all &s;he has to &s;ay. And if you <HI>have</HI> a &s;ecret, 'tis better to let her know it at fir&s;t. Charlotte is a generous girl, after all: But &s;ometimes, as now, a very impertinent one&mdash;</P>
<P>What could the&s;e ladies mean by this, I wonder? If they &s;u&s;pect me to love &s;omebody, &s;urely this is not the way, that two &s;uch Ladies, in <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> &s;hould take; when they think I have no engagement; and
<PB N="77" REF="78">
know that the doubt mu&s;t lie on their brother's &s;ide, whom, with all their <HI>roundabouts,</HI> as they call them, they cannot fathom.</P>
<P>I would give any-thing, methinks, to know if Sir Charles was ever in love.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t then a rapping at the door made us &s;uppo&s;e it was the Counte&s;s. It was. After compliments to Mrs. Reeves and me, &s;he embraced Lady L. very af|fectionately, and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on kindly; a&s;king the fir&s;t after Lord L.'s health, and the other after her Brother: He is the man of all men, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, that I want to &s;ee. We &s;hall be in town &s;oon, for a month or two; and then you mu&s;t make me known to one, whom every body calls the be&s;t of men: As here, &s;aid &s;he, coming up again to me, I have longed to be acquainted with one of the be&s;t of women.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Mi&s;s Byron is, indeed, an excellent young woman. We do our&s;elves the honour of calling her <HI>&s;i&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lady D.</HI> What an encouragement is that to be good? Even in this age, bad as it is, true merit will never want admirers. And let me &s;ay, that where beauty and goodne&s;s meet, as <HI>here,</HI> they adorn each other.</P>
<P>Agreeable Lady D.! thought I: My heart will not &s;ugge&s;t a thought in favour of your <HI>&s;on;</HI> but I &s;hall ea&s;ily be in love with <HI>you.</HI> The heart hardly de|&s;erves prai&s;e, my Lucy, that is not fond of it from the worthy.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip took Lady L. a&s;ide; and &s;aid &s;ome|thing to her. Lady L. an&s;wered with a No, as I &s;up|po&s;e: To which Lady D. replied, I am glad of that; adding, I am not afraid of &s;aying any-thing to a per|&s;on of Lady L.'s known prudence.</P>
<P>Ah! my Lucy! She a&s;ked Lady L. I dare &s;ay, whether the acknowleged &s;i&s;terhood extended to the brother, as a brother, or as&mdash;&s;omething el&s;e&mdash;And,

by her chearful and conde&s;cending court to me after|wards, and to Mrs. Reeves, was &s;atisfied by Lady L.'s an&s;wer, I make no doubt, that there is room for Lord D.'s addre&s;s, for any thing on Sir Charles's part.</P>
<P>I will not be mean, Lucy! Greatly as I admire &s;omebody, the&s;e excellent &s;i&s;ters &s;hall not find me <HI>en|tangled in an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip took my hand, and led me to the window. I was brought to town, &s;aid &s;he, on an ex|traordinary occa&s;ion, two days ago; and mu&s;t &s;et out on my return in the morning. I thought I would not mi&s;s the opportunity of paying my compliments to a young Lady, of whom I had heard every-body &s;peak with great commendation. I make no doubt but your good aunt Selby has&mdash;There &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>My aunt has &s;ent me up two of your Lady&s;hip's letters, and copies of her an&s;wers.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed with your frankne&s;s, my dear. It was that part of your character that engaged me. Young women, in the&s;e ca&s;es, are generally either &s;o affected, &s;o &s;tarched (as if they thought there were &s;omething &s;hameful in a treaty of this kind) or they are &s;o auk|ward, that I have not patience with them.

<P>Your Lady&s;hip does me high honour.</P>
<P>I am plea&s;ed even with that acknowlegement. The di&s;cretion of a per&s;on is often mo&s;t &s;een in minute|ne&s;&s;es.

To &s;ay truth, my dear, I did not intend to mention one word of the matter to you, on this fir&s;t vi&s;it.

I am &s;ure, my dear, we &s;hall be very happy in each other. If you and my Lord are happy, you and I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;o&mdash;But, when the knot is tied, I will be only your vi&s;itor, and that at your own invitation, I am thought to be a ma|naging woman: Managing women are not generally the be&s;t to live with. You, I under&s;tand, are an ex|cellent oeconomi&s;t (A glorious character in this age for a young woman!&mdash;Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t quality ought not to think them&s;elves above it). One per&s;on's methods may differ from another's; yet both may be equally good, and reach the &s;ame end. My &s;on has found the <HI>benefit</HI> of my oeconomy: Neverthele&s;s, his wife &s;hall not have cau&s;e to think, that, where &s;he means well, I will prefer my methods to hers. If ever I give advice, it &s;hall be only when you a&s;k it: And then, if you do not take it, I will not be angry; but allow, that, having weighed the matter well, you prefer your own judgment, on the be&s;t convictions. People who are to act for them&s;elves, &s;hould be always left to judge for them&s;elves; becau&s;e they only are an|&s;werable for their own actions. You blu&s;h, my dear;

I hope I don't oppre&s;s you. I would not oppre&s;s a mode&s;ty &s;o happily blended with frankne&s;s.</P>
<P>I was affected with her goodne&s;s. What an amia|ble frankne&s;s! O that all hu&s;bands mothers were like your Lady&s;hip! &s;aid I&mdash;What numbers of happy daughters-in-law would there then be, that now are not &s;o.</P>

<P>But, what, my dear!</P>
<P>Have you not, madam?&mdash;But your Lady&s;hip could <HI>not</HI> have received any letter from my aunt Selby&mdash;I wrote&mdash;</P>
<P>I have <HI>not,</HI> my dear. I could not, as you &s;ay. But I &s;hall find a letter from her, perhaps, on my return. You approve, I hope, of the propo&s;al, if you &s;hall have no objection to my &s;on?</P>
<P>My aunt, madam, will let you know&mdash;</P>

<P>Becau&s;e I would not be thought to be an in&s;incere creature, a trifler, I think I ought to mention to your Lady&s;hip, that it would be a great, a very great part of my happine&s;s, to be deemed worthy of your friend|&s;hip&mdash;without&mdash;</P>
<P>Without what?&mdash;You do well perhaps to blu&s;h! Without what?</P>
<P>Without the relation&mdash;if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>I was confounded with her goodne&s;s, Lucy. Here, my dear, is another &s;uperior character&mdash;I fancy her maiden-name was Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>But I <HI>don't plea&s;e.</HI> So no more of this. Let us join company. And, taking my hand, with the good|ne&s;s of a real mother; yet her brow a little over|clouded; &s;he made apologies to them for taking me a&s;ide; and &s;aid, &s;he could tru&s;t to their prudence, &s;he was &s;ure, as they mu&s;t needs gue&s;s at her view; and therefore &s;he offered not to put a limit to their con|jectures; &s;ince denial or eva&s;ion would but, in this ca&s;e, as it <HI>generally</HI> did, defeat its own end, and &s;trengthen what it aimed to weaken.</P>
<P>Is there no obtaining &s;uch a mother, thought I, without marrying Lord D.?&mdash;And &s;hould I refu&s;e to &s;ee him, if an interview is de&s;ired, e&s;pecially when Lady L. has &s;eemed to encourage the counte&s;s to think, that &s;omebody has no thoughts&mdash;Indeed I don't de&s;ire that that &s;omebody &s;hould&mdash;If&mdash;I don't know what I was going to add to that <HI>if:</HI> But pray tell my grandmamma, that I hope her Harriet will never give her cau&s;e to lament her being <HI>entangled in an hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> No, indeed.</P>

What is the meaning of this?&mdash;Is it a &s;ign&mdash;Ah! my Lucy! you &s;aid you would keep a &s;harp look-out; and did I not &s;ay I would upon my&s;elf? Surely I &s;aid truth: Surely you will think &s;o, when you &s;ee &s;uch little &s;illy things as the&s;e do not e&s;cape me. But when you think me too trifling, my dear, don't expo&s;e me. Don't read it out in the venerable circle. That to &s;ome may appear very weak and &s;illy, which by others will be thought excu&s;able, be|cau&s;e natural. It would be wrong (as I yet never did it) to write &s;eparately to you. And what have I in my heart, were it to be laid open to all the world, that I &s;hould be&mdash;afraid&mdash;I was going to write, that I &s;hould be <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> of? But I think I <HI>am</HI> a little a|&s;hamed, at times, for all that&mdash;Ah, Lucy! don't add, and &s;o I ought.</P>
<P>Lady D. repeated her de&s;ire of being acquainted with Sir Charles. She has no daughter: So it was purely for the &s;ake of his great character. She heard, &s;he &s;aid, that he was the polite&s;t of brothers. That was always a good &s;ign with her. He gives you, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, I am told, a great deal of his com|pany.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;aid, that their brother, &s;he be|lieved, was one of the bu&s;ie&s;t men in the kingdom, who was not engaged in public affairs; and yet the mo&s;t of a family-man. I endeavour, &s;aid &s;he, to make home delightful to him. I never break in upon him when he is in his &s;tudy, without leave: Indeed I &s;eldom a&s;k it; for when he is inclin'd to give me his company, he &s;ends his compliments to me, and re|que&s;ts, as a favour <HI>from</HI> me, what I am always ready to con&s;ider as one done <HI>to</HI> me. And I &s;ee he loves me: He is not unea&s;y in my company: He comes

for half an hour, and &s;tays an hour&mdash;But don't &s;et me into talking of him; for my heart always dilates, when I enter into the agreeable &s;ubject, and I know not where to &s;top.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Charlotte is a happy girl.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> And Lady L. is a happy woman; for he loves her as well as he loves me. Indeed he is &s;o good as to &s;ay (but I know it is to keep us from pull|ing caps) that he knows not which he loves be&s;t: We have different qualities, he &s;ays; and he admires in each what the other has not.</P>
<P><HI>Lady D.</HI> But what are his employments? What can he be &s;o much bu&s;ied in?</P>
<P><HI>M &s;s Gr.</HI> A continual round of good offices. He has a ward. She has a large fortune. The attention he pays to her affairs takes up a good deal of his time. He is his own &s;teward; and then he has a variety of other engagements, of which we a&s;k him not one word; yet long to know &s;omething about them.&mdash;But this we are &s;ure of, that, if he thinks any-thing will give us plea&s;ure, we &s;hall hear of it: if the contrary, he is as &s;ecret as the night.</P>
<P>Will nobody &s;ay one bad or one indifferent thing of this man, Lucy? There is no bearing the&s;e things! O my dear, what a Nobody is your poor Harriet?</P>
<P><HI>Lady D.</HI> He is one of the hand&s;ome&s;t men in Eng|land, they tell me.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Si&s;ters are not judges. They may be partial. His benignity of heart makes his face &s;hine. Had I a lover but half as hand&s;ome as I think my brother, I &s;hould make no objection to him on the account of per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> But he is the genteele&s;t of men!&mdash;What think <HI>you,</HI> &s;i&s;ter Harriet?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Si&s;ters are not judges. They may be partial.</P>
<P>What meant Lady L. to apply to me? But I had been &s;ome time &s;ilent. She <HI>could</HI> not mean any-thing:
<PB N="84" REF="85">
And both &s;i&s;ters complimented me on recognizing the relation.</P>
<P>Lady D. a&s;ked me how long I &s;hould &s;tay in town?</P>
<P>I &s;aid, I believed not long. I had leave for three months. Tho&s;e would be &s;oon elap&s;ed; and as my friends were &s;o good as to be plea&s;ed with my com|pany, I &s;hould rather choo&s;e to walk within than &s;tep out of my limits.</P>
<P>The Counte&s;s, with a nod of approbation, &s;aid, With good young people it will be always &s;o: And this is more prai&s;e-worthy in Mi&s;s Byron, as &s;he may do what &s;he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>Then, taking me a little a&s;ide&mdash;I hope, my dear, you meant nothing contrary to my wi&s;hes, when you referred, in &s;o doubtful a manner, to what you had written to your aunt. You don't an&s;wer me! This is a call upon your frankne&s;s. Women, when any|thing is depending, on which they have &s;et their hearts, are impatient&mdash;Don't you know that?&mdash;They love not &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>It is painful to me, Madam, to decline a propo&s;al that would give me a relation to &s;o excellent a wo|man&mdash;But&mdash;</P>
<P>But <HI>what,</HI> my dear?&mdash;Let not maidenly affectation &s;tep in with its cold water. You are above it. Wo|man to woman, daughter to mother&mdash;You are above it.</P>
<P>Then, turning to the Ladies, and to my cou&s;ins&mdash;You don't know, any of you (We are by our&s;elves) that Mi&s;s Byron's heart is engaged? Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on, let me apply to you: Maiden Ladies open their hearts to one another. Know you whether Mi&s;s By|ron has yet &s;een the man to whom &s;he wi&s;hes to give her hand? Her aunt Selby writes to me, that &s;he has not.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> We young women, madam, often know lea&s;t of our own hearts. We are almo&s;t as unwilling
<PB N="85" REF="86">
to find out our&s;elves in certain ca&s;es, as to be found out by others. Speak, &s;i&s;ter Harriet: an&s;wer for your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Was not this grievous, Lucy? And yet what ailed me, that I could not &s;peak without he&s;itation! But this Lady's conde&s;cending goodne&s;s&mdash;Yet this wicked Sir Hargrave! His attempt, his cruel treatment of me has made me quite another creature than I was.</P>
<P>My aunt Selby, madam, wrote the truth. To &s;ay I wi&s;h not to marry for &s;ome time to come, may &s;ound like an affectation, becau&s;e I have ever honour|ed the &s;tate&mdash;But &s;omething has happen'd that has put me out of conceit with my&s;elf, and with men too.</P>
<P><HI>Lady D.</HI> With <HI>all</HI> men, child?&mdash;I will allow for a great many things in a <HI>weak</HI> mind, that I will not in <HI>yours.</HI> I have had an hint or two about an in&s;ult, or I know not what, from Sir Hargrave Pollexfen, &s;ince I came to town; for I have a&s;k'd after you, my dear: But what is that but a confirmation of your merits? What a di&s;agreeable woman mu&s;t &s;he be, whom but one man in the world could like?</P>
<P>But excu&s;e me, Mi&s;s Byron. I have &s;aid abundance of impertinent things: I have gone further on this fir&s;t vi&s;it than I intended. You mu&s;t thank for this that in|genuous and open countenance, which confirms, at fir&s;t &s;ight, the character I had heard given by every|body who &s;poke of you. I &s;hall &s;ee, perhaps, what your aunt Selby, to whom you refer, writes, when I get down. I &s;hall &s;oon be in town, as I &s;aid, for the re&s;t of the winter; and then I will make my&s;elf mi|&s;tre&s;s of your whole hi&s;tory from the&s;e ladies, and from your&s;elf: And there &s;hall end all my enquiries, and, I hope, all my &s;olicitudes, on an article that is next my heart.&mdash;Mean time, adieu, my dear&mdash;Adieu.</P>
<P>She then, courte&s;ying to all round, gave her hand to Mr. Reeves, who led her to her chair; leaving us all full of her prai&s;es.</P>

<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> This mu&s;t do, Mi&s;s Byron: Who would not&punc; wi&s;h for &s;uch a mother?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Is the mother to be the principal induce|ment in &s;uch an article as this?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Why, my dear, do you pretend, in &s;uch an age of petits-maitres as this, to live &s;ingle, till you meet with a man who de&s;erves you?&mdash;But, Harriet, you mu&s;t voluntarily open your heart to me. I have a good deal of curio&s;ity; and, whenever you are di&s;|po&s;ed to gratify it, will not <HI>withdraw</HI> my attention.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I will read to you this moment, if you plea&s;e, Ladies, as to my &s;i&s;ters, what Lady D. wrote to my aunt Selby, and what my aunt an&s;wered on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> That's my be&s;t Harriet! I love to hear <HI>how</HI> and <HI>every thing about</HI> the&s;e &s;ort of matters.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> The&s;e girls, Mrs. Reeves, delight in love|&s;ubjects: There is a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m in the&s;e mat|ters that runs away with them.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Say you &s;o, Lady L.? And pray had you ever any of this enthu&s;ia&s;m? And if you had, did matrimony cure you of it?&mdash;See, Harriet! my &s;i&s;ter has not been married many months; yet how quietly &s;he now talks of the <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> of love to us maidens!&mdash;Ah! my dear Lady L.! women, I &s;ee, have their free-ma&s;onry, as well as men! Don't you think &s;o, Mrs. Reeves? A poor &s;ecret, after all, I believe, on both &s;ides, whi&s;per'd the lively Lady, but loud enough for every-one to hear what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>Lady L. called her a mad girl. But let us be fa|vour'd, &s;aid &s;he to me, with your communications.</P>
<P>I pulled out the letters. I read the two fir&s;t para|graphs in my aunt's letter to me, entire; for they propo&s;e the matter, and nothing el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="88">
What follows, &s;aid I, is full of love and care, and &s;o forth: But here is one paragraph more I can read to you.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> As much re&s;erve as you plea&s;e, &s;i&s;ter Harriet. I am learning how to deal with you.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Why that, Charlotte? No fear that you will tell us more than you have a mind we &s;hould know. Regard not, therefore, this threatening, Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> To own the truth, I cannot read every|thing my aunt writes: But the Counte&s;s of D.'s pro|po&s;als, and what relates to that, I will read, if you plea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> What you will&mdash;Read what you will. I find we are not at pre&s;ent &s;o well acquainted, as we &s;hall be hereafter.</P>
<P>What could Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on mean by that?</P>
<P>I read the la&s;t paragraph but one, in which my aunt propo&s;es my coming down; and that I will either en|courage the counte&s;s's propo&s;al, or accept of Mr. Orme; ending with the earne&s;t de&s;ire of my friends to have me married.</P>
<P>I then gave into Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's hand the count|e&s;s's fir&s;t Letter; and &s;he read it out.</P>
<P>She gave it me back, and thanked me. Were all women, &s;aid &s;he, capable of acting thus <HI>frankly,</HI> the &s;ex would leave affectation to the men-monkeys. Re|member, Harriet, that your openne&s;s of heart is one of the graces for which I principally admire you.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> O the rogue! take care of her, Mi&s;s Byron! She tells you this, to get out of you all your &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on may ea&s;ily obtain her end, madam, She need only tell me, what &s;he be&s;t likes I &s;hould be; and I mu&s;t try to be that.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Good girl! And take this along with you; that when you convince <HI>me,</HI> that you will not <HI>hide,</HI> I will convince <HI>you,</HI> that I will not <HI>&s;eek.</HI> But what is next?</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="89">
I then gave into her hand the copy of my aunt Selby's an&s;wer.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> May I read it all?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> If you plea&s;e: The fondne&s;s of my aunt, and the partiality of&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Away! away!&mdash;No affectation, child?</P>
<P>She read it out. Both &s;i&s;ters prai&s;ed the heart of the dear and thrice-indulgent writer! and called her <HI>their</HI> aunt Selby.</P>
<P>I then gave Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on the Counte&s;s's &s;econd letter. They were no le&s;s plea&s;ed with that than with the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> But now your opinion of the propo&s;al, child? Will you tru&s;t us with that? Have you a copy of what you wrote?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I kept a copy only of what immediately re&s;pected the propo&s;al; and that, becau&s;e it was po&s;|&s;ible I might want to have recour&s;e to it, as my aunt might, or might not, write farther about it.</P>
<P>I took it out of my pocket-book, and gave it to her to read.</P>
<P>Thank you, child, &s;aid &s;he: I &s;hould have no cu|rio&s;ity, if I did not love you.</P>
<P>She read it out: It was the paragraph that begins with <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You will, upon the &s;trength of what I have &s;aid," &amp;c. ending with "<HI>Such is my meaning.</HI>"</Q>&mdash;Luckily, I had not tran&s;cribed the concluding &s;entence of that paragraph; having been a&s;hamed of the odd words, <HI>Hope of your hope.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> But <HI>why</HI> &s;hould that be your <HI>meaning,</HI> my dear?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I added, I remember, that I was pained by the teazings of the&s;e men, one after another; that I never took delight in their airy adulation, and was now the more pained, becau&s;e of the vile attempt of Sir Hargrave, which had given me a &s;urfeit of the &s;ex.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> A temporary &s;urfeit! It is over, I hope, by this time. But, my dear&mdash;And yet as I owe to

<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on will oblige me, &s;ay what &s;he plea&s;es.</P>

<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Perhaps, now that Mi&s;s Byron has &s;een what a lady the counte&s;s of D. is&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> And now that &s;he has overcome the <HI>tem|porary &s;urfeit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> She will change her mind.</P>
<P>Are you not, my dear aunt Selby, are you not, my Lucy, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for me at this place? I was at the time greatly &s;o for my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> My mind has been greatly di&s;turbed by Sir Hargrave's violence; and by apprehen&s;ions of fatal mi&s;chiefs that might <HI>too</HI> probably have followed the generous protection given me.

&s;udden, to give &s;uch rea&s;ons for having refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to it, as you require; altho', at the &s;ame time, I find not in my heart the lea&s;t inclination to encourage it.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You have had your difficulties of late, my Harriet, to contend with: And tho&s;e you mu&s;t look upon as a tax to be paid by a merit &s;o con&s;pi|cuous. Even in this &s;lighter ca&s;e, as you love to oblige, I can pity you for the &s;ituation you are likely to be in, betwixt the refu&s;ed &s;on and the de&s;erving mother. But when you con&s;ider, that the plagues of the di&s;creet proceed from other people, tho&s;e of the in|di&s;creet from them&s;elves, you will &s;it down with a ju&s;t compliment to your&s;elf, and be content. You &s;ee I can be grave now and then, child.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> May I de&s;erve to be called prudent and di&s;creet! On that condition, I am willing to incur the penalty.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Come, come; that is out of the que&s;tion, my dear: So you are contented of cour&s;e, or in the way to be &s;o.</P>
<P>The Ladies took their leave, and &s;eemed plea&s;ed with their vi&s;it.</P>
<P>It is now, my dear friends, &s;ome-how or other, be|come nece&s;&s;ary, I think, to let you minutely into my &s;ituation, that you may advi&s;e, caution, in&s;truct me&mdash;For, I prote&s;t, I am in a &s;ort of wilderne&s;s.&mdash;Pray, my Lucy, tell me&mdash;But it cannot be from <HI>Love:</HI> So I don't care&mdash;Yet to lie under &s;uch a weight of obliga|tion; and to find my&s;elf &s;o much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the&s;e ladies&mdash;Yet it is not from <HI>Envy,</HI> &s;urely: That is a very bad pa&s;&s;ion. I hope my bo&s;om has not a place in it for &s;uch a mean &s;elf-tormentor. Can it be from <HI>Pride?</HI> Pride is a vice that always produces mortifica|tion: And proud you all made me of your favour&mdash;Yet I thought it was grateful to be proud of it.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I were with you, Lucy, I &s;hould a&s;k you abundance of que&s;tions; and repo&s;e my anxious heart on your faithful bo&s;om; and, at the &s;ame time, from

your an&s;wers, arm it again&s;t too great a &s;en&s;ibility, be|fore it was too late. But pray, don't I remember, that you &s;aid, you found &s;ighing a relief to you, on a cer|tain occa&s;ion? I am &s;erious, my dear. That there was a &s;ort of you-know-not-what of <HI>plea&s;ure</HI> in &s;igh|ing? Yet that it was involuntary?&mdash;Did you not &s;ay, that you were ready to quarrel with your&s;elf, you knew not why?&mdash;And, pray, had you not a fretting&punc; gnaw|ing pain in your &s;tomach, that made you I can't tell how to de&s;cribe it; yet were humble, meek, as if look|ing out for pity from every body, and ready to pity every-body?&mdash;Were you not attentive to &s;tories of people, young women e&s;pecially, labouring under doubts and difficulties?&mdash;Was not your humanity rai&s;ed? your &s;elf-con&s;equence lower'd? But did you not think <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;e</HI> the greate&s;t of all torments?&mdash;I think, my dear, you lived without eating or drink|ing; yet look'd not pining, but fre&s;h.&mdash;Pure Love is, perhaps, to lovers as the manna of heaven was to the I&s;raelites: But yet, I&s;raelite-like, we may be unea&s;y and murmur at the <HI>too-much</HI> of it.&mdash;Your re&s;t&mdash;I re|member it was broken. In your &s;leep you &s;eemed to be di&s;turbed. You were continually rolling-down mountains, or tumbling from precipices&mdash;or were borne down by tempe&s;ts, carried away with &s;udden in|undations; or &s;inking in deep waters; or flying from fires, thieves, robbers&mdash;</P>
<P>How apt are we to recollect, or to <HI>try</HI> to recollect, when we are apprehen&s;ive, that a ca&s;e may po&s;&s;ibly be our own, all tho&s;e circum&s;tances, of which, while another's (however dear that other might be to us) we had not any clear or adequate ideas!&mdash;But I know, that &s;uch of the&s;e as I recollect not from <HI>you,</HI> mu&s;t be owing to the danger, to the terror, I was in from the violence of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. Often and of|ten do I dream over again what I &s;uffered from him. I am now imploring mercy from him; and meet with nothing but upbraidings and menaces. He is

now &s;topping my mouth with his handkerchief: His horrible clergyman, if a clergyman he was, is reading the &s;ervice quite through: And I am contending again&s;t the legality of the a&s;&s;erted marriage. At other times, I have e&s;caped; and he is pur&s;uing me: He gains upon my flying feet; and I wake my&s;elf with endeavouring in vain to cry out for help.</P>
<P>But when fancy is more propitious to me, then comes my re&s;cuer, my deliverer: And he is &s;ome|times a mighty prince (dreams then make me a per|fect romancer) and I am a dam&s;el in di&s;tre&s;s. The milk-white palfrey once came in. All the Marvel|lous takes place; and lyons and tygers are &s;lain, and armies routed, by the pui&s;&s;ance of his &s;ingle arm.</P>
<P>Now, do not the&s;e re&s;veries convince you, that I owe all my unea&s;ine&s;s to what I &s;uffered from Sir Har|grave's barbarity? I think I mu&s;t take my aunt's ad|vice; leave London; and then I &s;hall better find out, whether, as all my friends &s;u&s;pect, and as, to be inge|nuous, I my&s;elf now begin &s;ometimes to fear, a pa&s;|&s;ion &s;tronger than gratitude has not taken hold of my heart.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sat. Mar. 4.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS morning Sir Hargrave Pollexfen made Mr. Reeves a vi&s;it. He &s;aid it was to him; but I was unluckily below; and forced to hear all he had to &s;ay, or to appear unpolite.</P>
<P>He propo&s;ed vi&s;iting my grandmamma and aunt Selby, in order to implore their forgivene&s;s. But Mr. Reeves diverted him from thinking of that.</P>
<P>He had not &s;ought me, he &s;aid, at Lady Betty Wil|liams's, but from his de&s;ire (on the character he had heard of me) to pay his addre&s;&s;es to me, in preference to every other woman. He had laid out for &s;everal opportunities to get into my company, before he heard I was to dine there. Particularly, he once had re|&s;olved to pay a vi&s;it in form to my uncle Selby, in Northampton&s;hire, and had got all his equipage in rea|dine&s;s to &s;et out; but heard that I was come to town with Mr. and Mrs. Reeves. He actually then &s;et out, he &s;aid, for Peterborough, with intent to propo&s;e the affair to my godfather Deane: But found that he was gone to Cambridge: And then, being re&s;olved to try his fate with me, he came to town; and hardly que|&s;tioned &s;ucceeding, when he under&s;tood that my friends left me to my own choice; and knowing that he could offer &s;uch propo&s;als, as none of the gentlemen who had made preten&s;ions to be, were able to make. His intentions therefore were not &s;udden, and &s;uch as aro&s;e upon what he &s;aw of me at Lady Betty Williams's; tho' the part I &s;upported in the conver&s;ation there, precipitated his declaration.</P>
<P>He was very unhappy, he &s;aid, to have &s;o mortally di&s;obliged me; and repeated all his former pleas; his
<PB N="94" REF="95">
love [Rough love, I am &s;ure] compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ufferings, and I cannot tell what; in&s;i&s;ting, that he had forgiven much greater injuries, as was but <HI>too</HI> apparent.</P>
<P>I told him, that I had &s;uffer'd more than he could have done, tho' his hurt was more vi&s;ible than mine: That neverthele&s;s I forgave him; as no bad con&s;e|quences had followed between him and my protector&mdash;[Protector! mutter'd he]&mdash;But that he knew my mind, before he made that barbarous attempt: And I be&s;ought him never more to think of me; and he mu&s;t excu&s;e me to &s;ay, that this mu&s;t be the very la&s;t time I ever would &s;ee him.</P>
<P>A great deal was &s;aid on both &s;ides; my cou&s;ins re|maining attentively &s;ilent all the time: And at la&s;t he in&s;i&s;ted, that I would declare that I never would be the wife either of Mr. Greville or Mr. Fenwick: A&s;|&s;uring me, that the ra&s;h &s;tep he had taken to make me his, was owing principally to his apprehen&s;ion, that Mr. Greville was more likely to &s;ucceed with me than any other man.</P>
<P>I owed him, I told him, no &s;uch declaration. But Mr. Reeves, to get rid of his importunity, gave it as his opinion, that there was no ground for his appre|hen&s;ions that I would give my hand to either; and I did not contradict him.</P>
<P>Mr. Bagenhall and Mr. Jordan, before I could get away from this importunate man, came to enquire for him. He then owned, that they came in hope of &s;eeing me; and be&s;ought me to favour him and them for one quarter of an hour only. I was re&s;olved to withdraw: But, at Sir Hargrave's command, as imper|tinently given as officiou&s;ly obeyed, Mr. Reeves's &s;er|vant led them (his ma&s;ter indeed not contradicting) in|to the parlour where we were.</P>
<P>The two &s;trangers behaved with great re&s;pect. They came with a re&s;olution to be plea&s;ed with me, and would not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be di&s;appointed. But never did men run prai&s;es higher, than both the&s;e
<PB N="95" REF="96">
gentlemen gave to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. And in|deed the &s;ubject made me ea&s;ier in their company than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have been.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible, I believe for the vaine&s;t mind to hear it&s;elf pro&s;u&s;ely prai&s;ed, without &s;ome pain: But it is &s;urely one of the &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures in the world, to hear a whole company join in applauding the ab&s;ent per&s;on who &s;tands high in our opinion; and e&s;pecially if he be one to who&s;e unexceptionable goodne&s;s we <HI>owe,</HI> and are not a&s;hamed to <HI>own,</HI> obligation.</P>
<P>What further plea&s;ed me, was to hear Mr. Bagen|hall declare, which he did in a very &s;erious manner, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's <HI>great</HI> behaviour, as he ju&s;tly called it, had made &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions not only upon him, but upon Mr. Merceda, that they were both determined <HI>to turn over a new leaf,</HI> was his phra&s;e; and to live very different lives from what they <HI>had</HI> lived; tho' they were far, they ble&s;&s;ed God, from being before the wor&s;t of men.</P>
<P>The&s;e gentlemen, with Mr. Merceda and Sir Har|grave, are to dine with Sir Charles to day. They both mentioned it with great plea&s;ure: But Sir Hargrave did not &s;eem &s;o well plea&s;ed, and doubted of his being able to per&s;uade him&s;elf to go. The invitation was given at Mr. Jordan's motion, who took hold of an indirect invitation of Sir Charles's; Mr. Jordan declaring, that he was re&s;olved not to let &s;lip any opportunity of improving an acquaintance with &s;o extraordinary a man.</P>
<P>The gentlemen took a very re&s;pectful leave. Sir Hargrave &s;hewed &s;o much dejection, and is &s;o really mortified with the damage done to a face, that he u&s;ed to take plea&s;ure to &s;ee reflected in the gla&s;s (never once looking into either of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e in the parlour he was in, all the time he &s;taid) that I could once or twice have been concerned for him, had I not &s;truggled to with|held my pity.</P>
<P>He talk'd of &s;oon leaving town, and retiring to one
<PB N="96" REF="97">
of his country-&s;eats; or of going abroad for a year or two, if he mu&s;t have no hopes&mdash;Hopes! a wretch!</P>
<P>When I &s;eriou&s;ly reflect, I don't know whether his mortification is not the happie&s;t thing that could have befallen him. It wants only to be attended with patience.&mdash;He is not <HI>now</HI> an ugly man in his per&s;on. His e&s;tate will always give him con&s;equence. He will now think the better of others; and the wor&s;e of him|&s;elf: He <HI>may, much</HI> wor&s;e; and not want as much va|nity as comes to his &s;hare.</P>
<P>But &s;ay you, my uncle (as I fan&s;y you do) that I al&s;o may &s;pare &s;ome of <HI>my</HI> vanity, and not be the wor&s;e girl?&mdash;Ah! no!&mdash;I am now very &s;en&s;ible of my own defects. I am poor, low, &s;illy, weak&mdash;Was I ever in&s;olent? Was I ever &s;aucy? Was I ever&mdash;O my uncle, hide my faults. I am mortified. Let me not reproach my&s;elf with having <HI>de&s;erved</HI> mor|tification. If I did, I knew it not. I intended not to be &s;aucy, vain, in&s;olent&mdash;And if I was &s;o, lay it to a flow of health, and good &s;pirits; to time of life; young, gay, and priding my&s;elf in every-one's love; yet mo&s;t in the love, in the fond indulgence, of all you my good friends: And then you will have &s;ome of my faults to lay at your own doors; nor will you, even <HI>you,</HI> my uncle, be clear of reproach, becau&s;e your correction was always mingled with &s;o much prai&s;e, that I thought you were but at play with your niece, and that you levelled your blame more at the Sex than at your Harriet.</P>
<P>BUT what have I written again&s;t my&s;elf? I believe I am <HI>not</HI> &s;uch a low, &s;illy, weak creature, as I had thought my&s;elf. For ju&s;t as I had laid down my pen with a pen&s;ive air, and to look into the &s;tate of my own heart, in order either to lighten, or to confirm, the &s;elf-blame I had &s;o glibly written down, Lady L. in her chair, made us a vi&s;it. She came up directly to me: I am come to dine with your cou&s;ins and you,
<PB N="97" REF="98">
Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid &s;he. Shall I be welcome? But don't an&s;wer me: I know I &s;hall.</P>
<P>Mrs. Reeves enter'd; and acknowledged the fa|vour.</P>
<P>Sir Hargrave Pollexfen, and &s;ome of his brethren, are to dine with my brother, &s;aid my Lady; and I, not being obliged to do the honours of the table, with my Lord's con&s;ent, made my e&s;cape. I cannot en|dure the wretch who could make &s;uch a vile attempt upon you, and who might have murder'd my bro|ther.&mdash;Come, will you let me &s;ee what you are write|ing? You can forgive <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s freedom: Will you excu&s;e her <HI>&s;i&s;ter</HI>'s?</P>
<P>I cannot &s;hew your Lady&s;hip all I have written; but I will read you &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the long letter before me.</P>
<P>I told her my &s;ubject, and read to her &s;uch as I thought I could read. She raved at Sir Hargrave: Wonder'd he had the confidence to approach me, e&s;pecially with hope. She prais'd me: Yet &s;aid to my cou&s;in Reeves, that he ought to have been denied the hou&s;e; and the rather, as I was my&s;elf very un|willing to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>I own, I thought &s;o too. Both my cou&s;ins are <HI>too</HI> good-natur'd.</P>
<P>We had a great deal of talk about the duel that was to happily prevented. Lady L. gave us an account of the unhappy one which her father fought; and to the i&s;&s;ue of which they owed the lo&s;s of the be&s;t of mo|thers: And at and after dinner &s;he piou&s;ly expatiated on the excellencies of that mother; and demon&s;trated, what I have often thought of great con&s;equence (my grandmamma's and aunt Selby's examples before me affording the noble&s;t proofs) that the conduct of wo|men in their families is of high importance; and that they need not to look out of them &s;o often as they do, to employ them&s;elves; and that not only in the mo&s;t u&s;eful, but in the mo&s;t delightful manner.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="99">
My Lord L. having broke from the company at Sir Charles's, did us the honour to drink tea with us. Every-thing, he &s;aid, pa&s;&s;ed very agreeably among the gentlemen he had left; and it was his opinion, that his brother's noble behaviour, and the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed at table, and in which he left him and them engaged, would make more than one convert among them.</P>
<P>He told Lady L. that Sir Charles was to &s;et out on Monday for Canterbury [For Canterbury, Lucy!]; and that he &s;hould take it for a favour, if &s;he would give him her company for a few days to Colnebrooke. Their hou&s;e in Brook-&s;treet, he &s;aid, would be ready to receive them in a week's time: It wanted nothing but a thorough airing. And if, &s;aid he, you could pre|vail upon Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on to be with us till her brother returns, and both &s;i&s;ters could induce Mi&s;s Byron to make a fourth, we &s;hall be, &s;aid he, the happie&s;t par|ty in the world; and perhaps may get Sir Charles among us, on his return, for a day or two. I bowed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, my Lord, that Charlotte and I thought to offer our attendance on Mi&s;s Byron to &s;ome of the public entertainments: But your Lord&s;hip's plea&s;ure &s;hall determine me; and if we could be &s;o happy as to have Mi&s;s Byron for our gue&s;t, I am &s;ure of my &s;i&s;ter; and it would be my preferable wi&s;h. Mr. Reeves, Mrs. Reeves, will you &s;pare Mi&s;s Byron to me?</P>
<P>I looked, as if for their leave. They gave a &s;mil|ing a&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>My Lord and Lady both expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves over|joy'd.</P>
<P>This Canterbury ran in my head. It was brought in naturally enough; and Mrs. Reeves wonder'd, that Sir Charles kept &s;ecret the motive of his journeying thither backward and forward. <HI>The godlike man,</HI> &s;aid Mr. Reeves, in the words of a great poet, <HI>has nothing to conceal.</HI> For my part, replied my Lord, I con|clude
<PB N="99" REF="100">
the motive is rather a painful than a plea&s;ura|ble one. Charlotte accu&s;es her brother of re&s;erves. I never found him re&s;erved: But he loves to play with her curio&s;ity, and amu&s;e her: For &s;he is very cu|rious, yet has <HI>her</HI> &s;ecret.&mdash;Has &s;he not, Lady L.?</P>
<P>Indeed &s;he has, replied my Lady&mdash;Perhaps you, my dear, will be intru&s;ted with it, when you are at Colne|brooke together.</P>
<P>Pray, madam, &s;aid I to Lady L. may I a&s;k?&mdash;Does Sir Charles give Lord G. his intere&s;t in his addre&s;&s;es to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> My brother wi&s;hes Charlotte married. He is a great friend to the married &s;tate; e&s;pecially with regard to our &s;ex.</P>
<P>Mr. Reeves could not mi&s;s this opportunity. It is a wonder, &s;aid he, that Sir Charles him&s;elf does not think of marriage?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> That is a &s;tring that we but ju&s;t touch &s;ometimes, and away. There is a Lady&mdash;</P>
<P>There &s;he &s;topt. Had &s;he looked with earne&s;tne&s;s at me, I had been undone, I believe.</P>
<P>[&rindx; Let me a&s;k you, Lucy: You have pa&s;&s;ed the fiery ordeal&mdash;Did you ever find in your&s;elf a kind of impatience, next to petulance; and in your heart (only for fear of expo&s;ing your&s;elf) that you were ready to quarrel, or to be &s;hort with any-body that came upon you of a &s;udden; yet have no bu&s;ine&s;s of con&s;equence to engage either your fingers or your thoughts?&mdash;Of late, my dear, I have been very often troubled with this odd &s;en&s;ation. But my whole tem|per is altering, I believe. I &s;hall grow peevi&s;h, per|ver&s;e, and gloomy, I doubt. O this wicked Sir Har|grave!&lindx;]</P>
<P>Pray, my dear, attend for the future to tho&s;e in|dexes or hands; and forbear to read out the pa&s;&s;ages inclo&s;ed by them, if you can&mdash;But if you come upon them before you are aware, why then read on&mdash;with all my heart.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="101">
But to return to Lady L.'s alarming hint&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There is a Lady"</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mrs. Reeves.</HI> That Sir Charles loves, I &s;uppo&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> That loves Sir Charles; and &s;he has&mdash;But for the Lady's &s;ake&mdash;Yet if it be allowable for any woman to be in love with any man, upon an un|certainty of return, it is for one that is in love with my brother.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> And cannot Sir Charles make a return?&mdash;Poor Lady!</P>
<P>My cou&s;in afterwards told me, that my upper-lip then quiver'd like an a&s;pen leaf. I did not know that it did. I felt not a trembling at my heart; and when the lip trembles, the heart, I think, &s;hould be affected. There u&s;ed to be a clo&s;e connexion between mine.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Reeves.</HI> Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on told <HI>me,</HI> that, if her brother married, half a &s;core women would break their hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> The words <HI>half a &s;core</HI> run as glibly off the tongue as <HI>half a dozen:</HI> But I believe, let the en|vious, the cen&s;orious, malign our &s;ex, and charge us with the love of rakes and libertines, as they will, if all men were like my brother, there would not be a &s;ingle woman, and hardly a bad one, in the kingdom. What &s;ay you, my Lord?</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> My dear life, you know I am all atten|tion, whenever you, or my &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, make our brother the &s;ubject of your panegyric. If Mi&s;s By|ron, you do not choo&s;e to hear &s;o much &s;aid of this be&s;t of men, you will, I doubt, have an ill time of it in the favour you will do us at Colnebrooke.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> My Lord, I &s;hould be very ungrateful, if I did not hear with plea&s;ure every-thing that &s;hall be &s;aid in prai&s;e of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> When I am out of conceit with men, as too often they give me cau&s;e to be, I think of my bro|ther, and forgive them.</P>
<P>I wonder, Lucy, what every-body <HI>means</HI> by prai&s;ing

Sir Charles Grandi&s;on &s;o much in my hearing&mdash;Shall I fly from town, to avoid hearing his prai&s;es?&mdash;Yes, &s;ay you?&mdash;But whither? It mu&s;t not be to Selby|hou&s;e. Well then, I may as well go to Colnebrooke. I &s;hall there be informed of the rea&s;ons for all tho&s;e general applau&s;es; for hitherto I know nothing of his hi&s;tory, to what they tell me I am to know.</P>

<P>LORD and Lady L. rejoice me, by telling me, you will accompany them to Colnebrooke on Mon|day.&mdash;That's my good girl!&mdash;I will go with them for the &s;ake of your company. Yet I had half-denied them: And why? Becau&s;e, if you mu&s;t know&mdash;But hu&s;h&mdash;and catch a mou&s;e&mdash;Becau&s;e a certain Imperti|nent propo&s;es a vi&s;it there; and I had thoughts to take the opportunity of being alone in town to rid my hands for ever, if po&s;&s;ible, of another &s;illy fellow, of whom, for one <HI>month,</HI> a great while ago, I thought tolerably.</P>
<P>You and I Harriet, will open to each other all our hearts. There is one chamber that has two beds in it. We will have that. Our dre&s;&s;ing-room &s;hall be common to both. Lady L. is a <HI>morning-killer:</HI> She always loved her bed: So we &s;hall have charming op|portunities for t&ecirc;te &agrave; t&ecirc;te conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I will drink tea with you to-morrow&mdash;No, but I won't: You and your cou&s;ins &s;hall drink tea with us&mdash;Do you hear? I won't be denied. And then we'll &s;ettle how it &s;hall be. I'll tell you what, my dear&mdash;
<PB N="102" REF="103">
If, on my brother's return from Canterbury, he comes to us at Colnebrooke, we will call him to account for all his re&s;erves. Here is this affair of Pollexfen's: How might it have ended! I tremble to think of it&mdash;You'll &s;tand by me: Won't you? I cannot make Lord and Lady L. of my party, or I would have re|belled before now&mdash;But you and I, my dear, I warrant you&mdash;Yet you are &s;o grave. Were you always &s;uch a grave, &s;uch a wi&s;e, &s;uch a <HI>very</HI> wi&s;e girl, Harriet? Was your grandfather a very &s;ententious man? Was his name <HI>Solomon</HI> Shirley?</P>
<P>I love wi&s;dom as well as any-body: But wi&s;dom, out of its place, is a prude, my dear. How I ramble!&mdash;You'll come to-morrow&mdash;I de&s;igned but two lines. Adieu. Believe me</P>

<P>I hope, Lucy, I was not wrong in &s;o readily con|&s;enting to go to Colnebrooke. My own inclination, indeed, was in my compliance; and I begin to mi&s;|tru&s;t my&s;elf, where-ever that &s;trongly leads. Yet why &s;hould I undervalue my&s;elf? I know my heart to be good. In that I will not yield to any-body. I have no littlene&s;s in my mind: <HI>Naturally</HI> I have not. Guard me, O my friends! by your prayers, that no littlene&s;s, that is <HI>not</HI> natural to my heart, may depre|ciate it, and make me unworthy of the love you have ever &s;hewn to</P>

<P>MY cou&s;ins will have it, that I am far gone in a certain pa&s;&s;ion [They &s;peak quite out]; and with a man that has given no encouragement&mdash;Encou|ragement!
<PB N="103" REF="104">
how meanly &s;ounds that word! But I hope they are mi&s;taken. I cannot &s;ay, but one may pre|fer, if one were to have one's choice&mdash;one man to another&mdash;But that is a different thing from being run away with by &s;o <HI>vehement</HI> a folly as they are ready to a&s;cribe to me.</P>
<P>Well, but, under this notion, they are &s;olicitous that I &s;hould not neglect any opportunity [What a poor creature do they think me!] of <HI>ingratiating</HI> my|&s;elf with the &s;i&s;ters: And therefore I mu&s;t, by all means, accept of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's invitation to tea.</P>
<P>I in&s;i&s;ted, however, that they &s;hould accompany me, as they likewi&s;e were invited: And they obliged me&mdash;I may &s;ay <HI>them&s;elves</HI> too; for they admire the brother and &s;i&s;ters as much as I do.</P>
<P>We found together Lord and Lady L. Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on, Mi&s;s Jervois, Dr. Bartlett, and Mr. Grandi&s;on. Sir Charles was in his drawing-room, adjoining to the &s;tudy; a lady with him, they &s;aid. What bu&s;ine&s;s had I to wi&s;h to know whether it was an elderly or a young lady? But I mu&s;t tell you all my follies. When we alighted, a very genteel chair made way for our coach.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on made up to me; and, as heretofore, &s;aid very &s;illy things, but with an air, as if he were ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;ay &s;uch, and to have them received as gallant things, by tho&s;e to whom he addre&s;&s;ed them. How painful is it to a mind not quite at ea&s;e, to be obliged to be civil, when the ear is invaded by con|temptible &s;peeches, from a man who mu&s;t think as highly of him&s;elf for uttering them, as meanly of the under&s;tanding of the per&s;on he is &s;peaking to!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;aw me a little unea&s;y, and came up to us. Mr. Grandi&s;on, &s;aid &s;he, I thought you had known Mi&s;s Byron's character by this time. She is &s;omething more than a pretty woman. She has a <HI>&s;oul,</HI> Sir: The man who makes a compliment to her on her beauty, depreciates her under&s;tanding.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">
She then led me to her &s;eat, and &s;at down next me.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on was in the mid&s;t of a fine &s;peech, and was not well plea&s;ed. He &s;at down, threw one leg over the knee of the other, hemm'd three or four times, took out his &s;nuff-box, tapped it, let the &s;nuff drop thro' his &s;ingers, then broke the lumps, then &s;hut it, and twirled it round with the fore-finger of his right-hand, as he held it between the thumb and fore|finger of the other; and was quite like a &s;ullen boy: Yet, after a while, tried to recover him&s;elf, by forc|ing a laugh at a &s;light thing or two &s;aid in company, that was not intended to rai&s;e one.</P>
<P>I think, my dear, I could have allowed a little more for him, had not his name been Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>We &s;oon adju&s;ted every-thing for the little journey. Mr. Grandi&s;on told Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, that if &s;he would make him amends for her treatment of him ju&s;t now, &s;he &s;hould put Lord L. upon inviting <HI>him.</HI> Lord and Lady L. joined to do &s;o. But Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on would not admit of his going; and I was glad of it.</P>
<P>But, not to affront you, cou&s;in, &s;aid &s;he, Mi&s;s By|ron and I want to have a good deal of particular con|ver&s;ation: So &s;hall not be able to &s;pare <HI>you</HI> an hour of our company at Colnebrooke. But one thing, Sir: My brother &s;ets out for Canterbury to-morrow: Tell him, that <HI>we</HI> won't be troubled with your company: A&s;k him, if <HI>he</HI> will?</P>
<P>Not in tho&s;e words neither, cou&s;in Charlotte: But I will offer my attendance; and if he accepts of it, I &s;hall be half as happy as if I went to Colnebrooke; and <HI>only</HI> half, bowing to me.</P>
<P>Why, now, you are a good docible kind of man! I want to hear what will be my brother's an&s;wer: For we know not one &s;yllable, nor can gue&s;s at his bu&s;i|ne&s;s at Canterbury.</P>
<P>The tea-equipage being brought in, we heard Sir Charles's voice, complimenting a lady to her chair; and who pleaded engagement for declining to drink
<PB N="105" REF="106">
tea with his &s;i&s;ter. And then he enter'd the parlour to us. He addre&s;&s;ed my cou&s;ins, who were next him, with his u&s;ual politene&s;s. He then came to me: How does my good Mi&s;s Byron? Not di&s;compo&s;ed, I hope by your ye&s;terday's vi&s;itors. They are all of them in love with you. But you mu&s;t have been pained&mdash;I was pained for you, when I heard they had vi&s;ited you. But extraordinary merit has &s;ome for|feitures to pay.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure then, thought I, you mu&s;t have a great many. Every-time I &s;ee him, I think he ri&s;es upon me in the gracefulne&s;s of his behaviour.</P>
<P>I have one agreeable piece of news to tell you, ma|dam. Sir Hargrave will go abroad for a twelvemonth. He &s;ays, he cannot be in the &s;ame kingdom with you, and not &s;ee you. He hopes therefore to le&s;&s;en the tor|ment, by flying from the temptation. Mr. Bagenhall and Mr. Merceda will go with him.</P>
<P>Then whi&s;pering me, he &s;aid, from an hint in the letter of the penitent Wil&s;on, that Mr. Bagenhall's cir|cum&s;tances are not happy, and that he is too much in the power of Sir Hargrave; I have prevailed on the latter, in con&s;ideration of the other's accompanying him abroad, to make him ea&s;y. And, would you be|lieve it? and can you forgive me?&mdash;I have brought Sir Hargrave to give Wil&s;on the promi&s;ed 100 <HI>l.</HI> To induce him to do this, Merceda (influenced by the ar|guments I urged, founded on the unhappy fellow's confe&s;&s;ions in that letter) offer'd 50 <HI>l.</HI> more for his pa&s;t &s;ervices to him&s;elf: And both, as a proof of the &s;ince|rity of their promi&s;ed reformation. Wil&s;on &s;hall not have the money, but upon his marrying the girl to whom he is contracted: And on my return from a little excur&s;ion I am making to Canterbury, I &s;hall put all in a train. And now, let me a&s;k you, once more, can you forgive me for <HI>rewarding,</HI> as you may think it, a ba&s;e &s;ervant?</P>
<P>O Sir! how can I an&s;wer you?&mdash;You told me at
<PB N="106" REF="107">
Colnebrooke, that we were to endeavour to bring good out of the evil from which you had deliver'd me. This indeed is making your words true in a very exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e: To make your enemies your friends; to put wicked men into a way of reformation; and to make it a bad man's intere&s;t to be good&mdash;<HI>Forgive</HI> you, Sir!&mdash;From what I remember of that poor wretch's letter, I was obliged to him my&s;elf: Tho' vile, he was le&s;s vile than he might have been. The young woman be|haved with tenderne&s;s to me at Paddington: Let me therefore add 50 <HI>l,</HI> to Mr. Merceda's 50 <HI>l.</HI> as an ear|ne&s;t that I can follow a noble example.</P>
<P>You charm me, madam, &s;aid he. I am not di&s;|appointed in my opinion of you&mdash;The fellow, if he give hope of real penitence, &s;hall not want the fourth 50 <HI>l.</HI>&mdash;It would be <HI>too good</HI> in you, &s;o great a &s;ufferer as you were by his wickedne&s;s, to give it: But it will become a man to do it, who has not been injured by him, and who was the occa&s;ion of his lo&s;ing the fa|vour of his employer; and the rather, as he was an advi&s;er to his fellow-agents to fly, and not to fire at my &s;ervants, who might have &s;uffer'd from a <HI>&s;turdier</HI> villain. He has promi&s;ed repentance and reforma|tion: This &s;mall &s;um will give me a kind of right to enforce the performance.&mdash;But no more of this ju&s;t now.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois ju&s;t then looking as if &s;he would be glad to &s;peak with her guardian, he aro&s;e, and taking her hand, led her to the window. She was in a &s;up|plicating attitude, as if a&s;king a favour. He &s;eemed to be all kindne&s;s and affection to her.&mdash;Happy girl!&mdash;Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, who had heard enough of what he &s;aid of Wil&s;on, to be affected, whi&s;per'd me, Did I not tell you, Harriet, that my brother was continu|ally employed in doing good? He has invention, foreca&s;t, and contrivance: But you &s;ee how tho&s;e qua|lities are all employed.</P>
<P>O Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! &s;aid I, I am &s;uch a nothing!
<PB N="107" REF="108">
&mdash;I cannot, as Sir Hargrave &s;ays, bear my own little|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Be quiet, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;You are an exceeding good girl! But you have a mon&s;trous deal of pride. Early I &s;aw that. You are not half &s;o good as the famous Greek, who lo&s;ing an election for which he &s;tood, to be one of 300 only, thank'd the gods, that there were in Athens (I think it was) 300 better men than him|&s;elf. Will you not have honour enough, if it can be &s;aid, that next to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, you are the be&s;t creature in the world?</P>
<P>Sir Charles led his ward to a &s;eat, and &s;at down by us.</P>
<P>Cou&s;in Charlotte, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on, you remem|ber your treatment of me, for addre&s;&s;ing Mi&s;s Byron in an open, and I thought, a very polite manner: Pray where's your impartiality? Sir Charles has been &s;hut up in his &s;tudy with a Lady who would not be &s;een by any-body el&s;e&mdash;But Sir Charles may do any|thing.</P>
<P>I am afraid it is too late, cou&s;in, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on: El&s;e it would be worth your while to try for a reputation.</P>
<P>Has Charlotte, Mr. Grandi&s;on, &s;aid Sir Charles, u&s;ed you ill? Ladies will do as they plea&s;e with you gallant men. They look upon you as their own; and you wi&s;h them to do &s;o. You mu&s;t bear the in|convenience for the &s;ake of the convenience.</P>
<P>Well, but, Sir Charles, I am refu&s;ed to be of the Colnebrooke party&mdash;Ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed. Will <HI>you</HI> ac|cept of my company? Shall I attend you to Canter|bury?</P>
<P>Are you in earne&s;t, cou&s;in Grandi&s;on? Will you oblige me with your company?</P>
<P>With all my heart and &s;oul, Sir Charles.</P>
<P>With all mine, I accept your kind offer.</P>
<P>This agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed his &s;i&s;ters as well as me: But why then &s;o &s;ecret, &s;o re&s;erved, to them?</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="109">
Mr. Grandi&s;on immediately went out to give or|ders to his &s;ervant for the journey.</P>
<P>A good-natur'd man! &s;aid Sir Charles.&mdash;Charlotte, you are &s;ometimes too quick upon him&mdash;Are you not?</P>
<P>Too quick upon him!&mdash;No, no! I have hopes of him; for he can be a&s;ham'd: That was not always the ca&s;e with him. Between your gentlene&s;s and my quickne&s;s, we &s;hall make &s;omething of him in time.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on immediately return'd; and we lo&s;t &s;omething that Sir Charles was going to reply. But, by &s;ome words he dropt, the purport was to blame his &s;i&s;ter for not &s;paring Mr. Grandi&s;on before company.</P>
<P>I imagine, Sir Charles, that if you take Mr. Gran|di&s;on with you, one may venture to a&s;k a que&s;tion, Whether you go to any family at Canterbury, that we have heard of?&mdash;It is to do good, I am &s;ure.</P>
<P>Your eyes have a&s;k'd me that que&s;tion &s;everal times, Charlotte. I aim not at making &s;ecrets of any thing I do. I need not on this occa&s;ion. Yet you, Char|lotte, have your &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>He look'd grave.</P>
<P>Have I my &s;ecrets, Sir Charles?&mdash;Pray what do you mean?</P>
<P>She colour'd, and &s;eem'd &s;en&s;ibly touch'd.</P>
<P>Too much emotion, Charlotte, is a kind of con|fe&s;&s;ion. Take care. Then turning it off with a &s;mile&mdash;See, Mr. Grandi&s;on, I am revenging your cau&s;e. Alarming &s;pirits love not to be alarmed.</P>
<P>So, Harriet! whi&s;pering to me, I am &s;ilenced. Had I told you all my heart, I &s;hould half have &s;u|&s;pected you. How he has flutter'd me!&mdash;Lady L. this is owing to you, whi&s;pering her behind my chair.</P>
<P>I know nothing, therefore could tell nothing. Con|&s;cience, con&s;cience! Charlotte, re-whi&s;per'd Lady L.</P>
<P>She &s;at &s;till, and was &s;ilent for a little while; Lord and Lady L. &s;miling, and &s;eeming to enjoy her agree|able confu&s;ion. At la&s;t&mdash;But, Sir Charles, you <HI>always</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="110">
had &s;ecrets. You got out of me two or three of mine without exchange.&mdash;You&mdash;</P>
<P>Don't be unea&s;y, my Charlotte. I expected a <HI>prompt,</HI> not a <HI>deliberate</HI> reply. My life is a various life. Some things I had better not have known my&s;elf. See, Charlotte, if you are &s;erious, you will make me &s;o. I have not any motives of action, I hope, that are either capricious or conceited [Surely, Lucy, he cannot have &s;een what I wrote to you about his re|&s;erves! I thought he look'd at me]&mdash;Only this one hint my &s;i&s;ter: Whenever you conde&s;cend to con&s;ult me, let me have every-thing before me, that &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to enable me to form a judgment&mdash;But why &s;o grave, Charlotte? Impute all I have &s;aid, as a re|venge of Mr. Grandi&s;on's cau&s;e, in gratitude for his obliging offer of accompanying me to Canterbury.</P>
<P>Cannot you reward <HI>him,</HI> Sir Charles but by puni&s;h|ing <HI>me?</HI></P>
<P>A good que&s;tion, Charlotte. But do you take what I have &s;aid in that light?</P>
<P>I have done for the pre&s;ent, Sir: But I hope, when you return, we &s;hall come to an eclairci&s;&s;ement.</P>
<P><HI>Needs</HI> it one?&mdash;Will not better and more intere&s;t|ing &s;ubjects have taken place by that time?&mdash;And he look'd at her with an eye of particular meaning.</P>
<P>Now is he beginning to wind about me, whi&s;per'd &s;he to me, as I told you at Colnebrooke. Were he and I alone, he'd have me before I knew where I was. Had he been a wicked man, he would have been a <HI>very</HI> wicked one.</P>
<P>She was vi&s;ibly unea&s;y; but was afraid to &s;ay any more on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Lady L. whi&s;per'd&mdash;Ah! Charlotte, you are taken in your own toils. You had better let me into your &s;ecret. I would bring you off, if I could.</P>
<P>Be quiet, Lady L.</P>
<P>We then talk'd of the time in the morning of our &s;etting out for Colnebrooke. I thought I read Mi&s;s
<PB N="110" REF="111">
Emily's mind in her eyes&mdash;Shall we not have the plea&s;ure of Mi&s;s Jervois's company? &s;aid I.</P>
<P>She bowed to me, and &s;miled.</P>
<P>The very thing that Emily was petitioning to me for, &s;aid Sir Charles: And I wi&s;h'd, ladies, to have the motion come from one of you.</P>
<P>Emily &s;hall go with us, I think, &s;aid Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on.</P>
<P>Thank you, madam, &s;aid &s;he: I will take care not to break in upon you impertinently.</P>
<P>What! do&s;t thou too think we have &s;ecrets, child?</P>
<P>Con&s;ent with your u&s;ual grace, Charlotte: Are you not too ea&s;ily affected? Sir Charles &s;poke this &s;miling. Every thing you &s;ay, Sir Charles, affects me.</P>
<P>I ought then to be very careful of what I &s;ay. If I have given my &s;i&s;ter pain, I beg her to forgive me.</P>
<P>I am afraid to go on, whi&s;per'd &s;he to me. Were he and I only together, my heart would be in his hand in a moment.</P>
<P>I have only this to ob&s;erve, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, whi&s;|per'd I&mdash;When you are too hard upon me, I know to whom to apply for revenge.</P>
<P>Such another word, Harriet, and I'll blow you up!</P>
<P>What could &s;he mean by that?&mdash;<HI>Blow me up!</HI> I have lock'd up my aunts la&s;t lettets, where &s;o much is &s;aid about <HI>entangling,</HI> and <HI>Inclination,</HI> and &s;o-forth. When any-thing occurs, that we care not to own, I &s;ee by Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, that it is ea&s;y for the &s;lighte&s;t hint to alarm us.</P>
<P>But Sir Charles to &s;ay &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly as he did, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That his life was a various life;" and that "he had better not have known &s;ome things him&s;elf;"</Q> affects me not a litte. What can a man of his prudence have had to di&s;turb him? But my favourite author &s;ays,</P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Yet, with a &s;igh o'er all mankind, I grant,</L>
<L><HI>In this our</HI> day of proof, <HI>our</HI> land of hope,</L>

<P>But &s;o young a man! &s;o prudent! as I &s;aid; and &s;o generally beloved! But that he is &s;o, may be the occa&s;ion.&mdash;Some lady, I doubt!&mdash;What &s;ad people are we women at this rate! Yet &s;ome women may have the wor&s;t of it. What are your thoughts on all the&s;e appearances, Lucy?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, as I &s;aid, is unea&s;y. The&s;e are the words that di&s;turb her: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Only this one hint, my &s;i&s;ter: Whenever you conde&s;cend to con&s;ult me, let me have every-thing before me, that &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to enable me to form a judgment."</Q>&mdash;And &s;o they would <HI>me</HI> in her ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems plain from Sir Charles's hint, that he keeps to him&s;elf (as Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on once indeed &s;aid in his favour) tho&s;e intelligences which would di&s;turb her, and his other friends, to know. The &s;ecret which he would have made of the wicked challenge; his &s;elf-invited breakfa&s;ting with Sir Hargrave; are proofs among others, of this: And if this be his con&s;iderate motive, what a forward, what a cen&s;orious creature have I been, on &s;o many occa&s;ions, to blame him for his re&s;erves, and particularly for his Canterbury excur|&s;ions! I think I will be cautious for the future, how I take upon me to cen&s;ure tho&s;e actions, which in &s;uch a man I cannot account for.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, on her brother's withdrawing with Dr. Bartlett, &s;aid, Well, now that my cou&s;in Gran|di&s;on will accompany my brother to Canterbury, we &s;hall have that &s;ecret out in cour&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> It &s;eems to be your fault, Charlotte, that we have not had it before.</P>

<P><PB N="112" REF="113">
<HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> Perhaps not. You'll find I can keep a &s;ecret, cou&s;in; e&s;pecially if I am de&s;ired to do &s;o.</P>

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> True, Mr. Grandi&s;on. There is but one man in the world, of whom I &s;tand in awe.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> I believe it; and hope you never de&s;ign to marry, for <HI>that</HI> rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> What a wretch is my cou&s;in! Mu&s;t a woman &s;tand in awe of her hu&s;band? Whether, Sir, is marriage a &s;tate of &s;ervitude or of freedom to a woman?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> Of freedom, as women generally make it&mdash;Of &s;ervitude, if they know their duty.&mdash;Pardon me, Ladies.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Don't pardon him. I &s;uppo&s;e, Sir, it is owing to your con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that you have only the <HI>will,</HI> and not the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> to awe a woman of &s;en&s;e, that you are a &s;ingle man at this day.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Pray, my Lord, what have I done, that you treat me with &s;o much contempt?</P>
<P><HI>Lord L. Contempt!</HI> my be&s;t life!&mdash;How is that?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> You &s;eem not to think it worth your while to <HI>over-awe</HI> me.</P>

<P><HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> The devil's in it if you two Ladies want help. I fly the pit.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> And I think, Mr. Grandi&s;on, you have fought a hard battle.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> By my &s;oul, I think &s;o too. I have held it out better than I u&s;ed to do.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I prote&s;t I think you have. We &s;hall brighten you up among us. I am mi&s;taken if there were not two or three &s;mart things &s;aid by my cou&s;in. Pray, did any-body mind them? I &s;hould be glad to hear them again. Do you recollect them your&s;elf, cou&s;in?</P>

<SALUTE>My deare&s;t Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are all extremely affected with your pre&s;ent &s;itu|ation. Such apparent &s;truggles betwixt your na|tural openne&s;s of heart, and the confe&s;&s;ions of a young,
<PB N="115" REF="116">
of a new pa&s;&s;ion, and that &s;o laudably founded, and &s;o vi&s;ibly increa&s;ing&mdash;O my Love, you mu&s;t not af|fect re&s;erves. They will &s;it very aukwardly upon a young woman, who never knew what affectation and concealment were.</P>
<P>You have laid me under a difficulty with re&s;pect to Lady D. She is to be with me on Saturday next. I I have not written to her, tho' you de&s;ired I would; &s;ince, in truth, we all think, that her propo&s;als de&s;erve con&s;ideration; and becau&s;e we are afraid, that a <HI>greater</HI> happine&s;s will never be yours and ours. It is impo&s;&s;ible, my dear, to imagine, that &s;uch a man as Sir Charles Grandi&s;on &s;hould not have &s;een the wo|man whom he could love, before he &s;aw you; or whom he had not been engaged to love by his <HI>grati|tude,</HI> as I may call it, for her <HI>Love.</HI> Has not his &s;i&s;ter talk'd of half a &s;core Ladies, who would break their hearts for him, were he to marry?&mdash;And may not this be the rea&s;on why he does not?</P>
<P>You &s;ee what an amiable openne&s;s of heart there is in the counte&s;s of D. You &s;ee, that your own frank|ne&s;s is a particular recommendation of you to her. I had told her, that you were di&s;engaged in your affec|tions: By your own di&s;claiming to her the propo&s;ed relation, you have given rea&s;on to &s;o wi&s;e a Lady to think it otherwi&s;e; or that you are not &s;o much above affectation, as &s;he had hoped you were. And tho' we were grieved to read how much you were pu&s;hed by Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Letter V. p. 71.</NOTE>, yet Lady D. will undoubtedly make the &s;ame ob&s;ervations and inferences, that Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on did. And what would you have me do? &s;ince you cannot give a &s;tronger in&s;tance of your af|fections being engaged, than by declining &s;uch a pro|po&s;al as Lady D. made, before you have conver&s;ed with, or even &s;een Lord D. And it becomes not your character nor mine, either to equivocate, or to &s;ay the thing that is not.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="117">
Lady L. you think (and indeed &s;o it appears) hint|ed to Lady D. that Sir Charles &s;tands not in the way of Lord D.'s application. I &s;ee not therefore, that there can be any room to hope from that quarter. Nor will your fortune, I doubt, be thought con&s;ider|able enough. And as Sir Charles is not engaged by affection, and is generous and munificent, there is hardly room to imagine, but that, in prudence, for|tune will have &s;ome weight with him. At lea&s;t, on our &s;ide, that ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed, and to make a part of our fir&s;t propo&s;als, were a treaty to be begun.</P>
<P>Your grandmamma will write to you with her own hand. I refer my&s;elf wholly to her. Her wi&s;dom, and her tenderne&s;s for you, we all know. She and I have talked of <HI>every-thing.</HI> Your uncle will not railly you, as he has done. We &s;till continue re&s;olved not to pre&s;cribe to your inclinations. We are afraid there|fore of advi&s;ing you as to this new propo&s;al. But your grandmamma is very much plea&s;ed that I have not written as you would have had me, a letter of ab&s;o|lute refu&s;al to the counte&s;s.</P>
<P>Your uncle has been enquiring into the &s;tate of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's affairs. We have heard &s;o many good things of him, that I have de&s;ired Mr. Selby to make no further enquiries, unle&s;s we could have &s;ome hopes of calling him ours. But do you, my dear, neverthele&s;s, omit nothing that comes to your know|ledge, that may let us know in him what a good man is, and &s;hould be.</P>
<P>His magnanimity in refu&s;ing to engage in a duel, yet acquitting him&s;elf &s;o honourably, as to leave no doubt about his courage, is an example, of it&s;elf, of a more than human rectitude of thinking and acting. How would your grandfather have cheri&s;hed &s;uch a young man! We every one of us admire and revere him at the &s;ame time; and congratulate you, my dear, and his &s;i&s;ters, on the happy i&s;&s;ue of the affair between him and that vile Sir Hargrave.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="118">
You will let me know your mind as to the affair of Lord D.; and that by the next po&s;t: Be not ra&s;h. Be not ha&s;ty&punc; I am afraid I pu&s;h'd your delicacy too much in my former. Your uncle &s;ays, that you are at times not &s;o frank in directly owning your pa&s;&s;ion, as from your natural opene&s;s of heart he expected you would be, when a worthy object had attracted you: And he triumphs over us, in the imagination, that he has at la&s;t detected you of affectation in &s;ome little degree. We all &s;ee, and own, your &s;truggle between virgin-mode&s;ty and opene&s;s of heart, as apparent in many pa&s;&s;ages of your letters; and we lay part of your re&s;erve to the apprehen&s;ions you mu&s;t have of his raillery: But after you have declared, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That you had rather conver&s;e but one hour in a week with Sir Charles Grandi&s;on"</Q> (and <HI>his &s;i&s;ter</HI> you put in: And &s;i&s;ters are good convenient people &s;ometimes to a ba&s;hful or beginning lover, of our &s;ex) <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"than be the wife of any man you have ever &s;een or known; and that, mean as the word <HI>pity</HI> &s;ounds, you would ra|ther have his pity than the love of any other man;"</Q>&mdash;Upon my word, my dear, you need not be back|ward to &s;peak quite out. Excu&s;e me, my child.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now read the inclo&s;ed. Had I known your grandmamma could have written &s;o long a letter, I might have &s;pared much of mine. Hers is worthy of her. We all &s;ub&s;cribe to it; but yet will be de|termined by your next, as to the &s;teps to be taken in relation to the propo&s;al of Lady D. But if you love, be not a&s;hamed to own it to us. The man is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>With all our ble&s;&s;ings and prayers for you, I bid you, my dear Love, Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. Mrs. <HI>SHIRLEY,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Sunday, March 5.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>DON'T be afraid, don't be a&s;hamed, my deare&s;t Life, to open your whole heart to your aunt Selby and me. You know how we all dote upon you. It is no di&s;grace for a young woman of virtue to be in love with a worthy man. Love is a natural pa&s;|&s;ion. <HI>You</HI> have &s;hewn, I am &s;ure, if ever young crea|ture did &s;hew, that you are no giddy, no indi&s;creet per&s;on. Not Greville, with all his gaiety; not Fenwick, with all his adulation; not the more re|&s;pectable Orme, with all his ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s; nor yet the imploring Fowler; nor the terrifying, the &s;hock|ing Sir Hargrave Pollexfen; have &s;een the lea&s;t &s;ha|dow of vanity or weakne&s;s in you. How happily have you &s;teer'd thro' difficulties, in which the love of being admired often involves meaner minds! And how have you, with mingled dignity and courteou&s;ne&s;s, en|titled your&s;elf to the e&s;teem, and even veneration, of tho&s;e whom you refu&s;ed! And why refu&s;ed! Not from pride, but principle; and becau&s;e you could not love any one of them, as you thought you ought to love the man to whom you gave your hand.</P>
<P>And at la&s;t, when the man appeared to you, who was worthy of your love; who had &s;o powerfully pro|tected you from the lawle&s;s attempt of a fierce and cruel pretender; a man who proved to be the be&s;t of brothers, friends, landlords, ma&s;ters, and the brave&s;t and be&s;t of men; is it to be wonder'd at, that an heart, which never before was won, &s;hould di&s;cover &s;en&s;ibi|lity, and acknowledge its fellow-heart?&mdash;What rea&s;on then can you have for &s;hame? And why &s;eeks my Harriet to draw a curtain between her&s;elf and her &s;ym|pathizing friends? You &s;ee, my dear, that we are
<PB N="119" REF="120">
above &s;peaking &s;lightly, becau&s;e of our uncertainty, of a man that all the world prai&s;es. Nor are you, child, &s;o weak as to be treated with &s;uch poor policy.</P>
<P>You were not educated, my dear, in artifice. Di&s;|gui&s;es never &s;at &s;o ill upon any woman, as they do, in mo&s;t of your late letters, upon you. Every child in love-matters would find you out. But be it your glory, whether our wi&s;hes are, or are not an&s;wered, that your affection is laudable; that the object of it is not a man mean in under&s;tanding, profligate in mo|rals, nor &s;ordid in degree; but &s;uch an one as all we your friends are as much in love with as you can be. Only, my dear Love, my Harriet, the &s;upport of my life, and comfort of my evil days, endeavour, for my &s;ake, and for the &s;ake of us all, to re&s;train &s;o far your laudable inclination, as that, if it be not your happy lot to give us, as well as your&s;elf, &s;o de&s;irable a ble&s;|&s;ing, you may not &s;uffer in your health (an health &s;o precious to me) and put your&s;elf on a &s;oot with vul|gar girls run away with by their head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions. The more de&s;irable the object, the nobler the con|que&s;t of your pa&s;&s;ion, if it is to be overcome. Never|thele&s;s, &s;peak out, my dear, your whole heart to us, in order to intitle your&s;elf to our be&s;t advice: And as to your uncle Selby, don't let his raillery pain you: He diverts us as well as him&s;elf by it: He gains no|thing over us in the arguments he affects to hold with us: And you mu&s;t know, that his whole hone&s;t heart is wrapt up in his and our Harriet. Worthy man! He would not, any more than I, be able to &s;upport his &s;pirits, were any misfortune to befal his niece.</P>
<P>Your aunt Selby has ju&s;t now &s;hewn me her letter to you. She repeats in it, as a very &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion in yours, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That you had rather conver&s;e wi&s;h this excellent man but one hour in a week, than be the wife of any man you have ever &s;een or known."</Q> It <HI>is</HI> a &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion; but, to me, is an expre&s;&s;ion greatly to your honour; &s;ince it &s;hews, that the <HI>mind,</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="121">
and not the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> is the principal object of your love.</P>
<P>I knew that, if ever you did love, it would be a love of the pure&s;t kind. As therefore it has not &s;o much <HI>per&s;on</HI> in it, as mo&s;t loves; &s;uffer it not to tri|umph over your rea&s;on; nor, becau&s;e you cannot have the man you could prefer, re&s;olve again&s;t having any other. Have I not taught you, that marriage is a duty, whenever it can be enter'd into with prudence? What a mean, what a &s;elfi&s;h mind mu&s;t that per&s;on have, whether man or woman, who can re&s;olve again&s;t entering into the &s;tate, becau&s;e it has its cares, its fa|tigues, its inconveniencies! Try Sir Charles Gran|di&s;on, my dear, by this rule. If he forbears to marry on &s;uch narrow motives, this mu&s;t be one of his great imperfections. Nor be afraid to try. No man is ab|&s;olutely perfect.</P>
<P>But Sir Charles may have engagements, from which he cannot free him&s;elf. My Harriet, I hope, will not give way to a pa&s;&s;ion, which is not likely to be returned, if &s;he find that to be the ca&s;e. You hope, you prettily &s;aid in one of your letters, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that you &s;hall not be undone by a <HI>good</HI> man."</Q> After &s;uch an e&s;cape as you had from Sir Hargrave, I have no fear from a <HI>bad</HI> one: But, my child, if you are undone by a good one, it mu&s;t be by your own fault, while nei|ther he nor his &s;i&s;ters give you encouragement.</P>
<P>I know, my dear, how the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions will hurt your delicacy: But then you mu&s;t doubly guard your|&s;elf; for the <HI>reality</HI> will be wor&s;e wounding to that delicacy, than the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ition</HI> ought to be. If there be but one man in the world that can <HI>undo</HI> you, will you not guard again&s;t him?</P>
<P>I long to fold my deare&s;t Harriet to my fond heart: But yet, this that follows, is the advice I give, as to the &s;ituation you are now in: Lo&s;e no opportunity of cul|tivating the friend&s;hip of his amiable &s;i&s;ters [By the way, if Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on gue&s;&s;es at your mind, &s;he is
<PB N="121" REF="122">
not &s;o generous in her raillery as is con&s;i&s;tent with the re&s;t of her amiable character]. Never deny them your company, when they reque&s;t it. Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on has promi&s;ed you the hi&s;tory of their family. Exact the performance of that promi&s;e from her. You will thus come at further lights, by which you may be guided in your future &s;teps.&mdash;In particular, you will find out, whether the &s;i&s;ters e&s;pou&s;e the in|tere&s;t of any other woman: tho' Sir Charles's re&s;erv|edne&s;s, even to them, may not let them know the &s;ecrets of his heart in this particular. And if they do not e&s;pou&s;e any other per&s;on's intere&s;t, why may they not be made <HI>your</HI> friends, my dear?&mdash;As to for|tune, could we have any hint what would be expect|ed, we would do every thing in our power to make that matter ea&s;y; and mu&s;t be content with moderate &s;ettlements in your favour.</P>
<P>But as I approve of your aunt's having forborn to write, as you would have had her, to Lady D. What &s;hall we do in that affair? It will be a&s;k'd.</P>
<P>What? Why thus: Lady D. has made it a point, that you are di&s;engaged in your affections: Your aunt has &s;ignified to her that your are: You have given that Lady an hint, which, you &s;ay, overclouded her brow. She will be here on Saturday next. Then will &s;he, no doubt, expect the opene&s;t dealing.&mdash;And &s;he ought to have it. Her own frankne&s;s demands it; and the cha|racter we have hitherto &s;upported, and I hope always &s;hall &s;upport, requires it. I would therefore let Lady D. know the whole of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen's attempt [You, my dear, was &s;o laudably frank as to <HI>hint</HI> it to her] and of the generous protection given you by Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. Truth never leaves room for &s;elf-reproach. Let your aunt Selby then own, that you had written to her; declining, with the mo&s;t re|&s;pectful gratitude, the honour intended you: Which &s;he could no otherwi&s;e account for, than by &s;uppo&s;ing, and indeed believing, that you would prefer Sir Charles
<PB N="122" REF="123">
Grandi&s;on, from motives of gratitude, to any other man: But that you knew nothing of his engagements; nor had rea&s;on to look upon any part of his behaviour to you, but as the effect of his general politene&s;s; nor that his &s;i&s;ters meant more by calling you <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> than their <HI>brother</HI>'s &s;i&s;ter, as well as <HI>theirs.</HI></P>
<P>All this &s;hall be mentioned to Lady D. in <HI>&s;trict con|fidence.</HI> Then will Lady D. know the whole truth. She will be enabled, as &s;he <HI>ought,</HI> to judge for her&s;elf. You will not appear in her eye as guilty of affectation. We &s;hall all act in character. If Lady L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on did (as you &s;uppo&s;e) acquaint Lady D. that you were not addre&s;&s;ed by their brother, they will be found to have &s;aid the truth; and you know, my dear, that we &s;hould be as ready to do ju&s;tice to others vera|city, as to our own. She will &s;ee, that your regard for Sir Charles (if a regard you have, that may be an ob|&s;tacle to her views) is owing to a laudable gratitude for his protection given to a young woman, who&s;e heart was <HI>before</HI> ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged.</P>
<P>And what will be the con&s;equence?&mdash;Why, either that her Lady&s;hip will think no more of the matter; and then you will be ju&s;t where you were; or, that &s;he will intere&s;t her&s;elf in finding out Sir Charles's en|gagements: And as you have communicated to Lady L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on the letters that have pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Lady D. and your aunt, together with the con|tents of yours, &s;o far as relates to the propo&s;al; and as Lady D. is acquainted with tho&s;e two ladies; &s;he will probably inform her&s;elf of <HI>their</HI> &s;entiments in re|lation to the one affair and the other; and the matter on every &s;ide, by this means, will &s;ooner come to a deci&s;ion, than probably it can any other way.</P>
<P>I don't know whether I expre&s;s my&s;elf clearly. I am not what I was: But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, that I am what I am! I did not think, that, in &s;o little a time, I could have written &s;o much as I have. But my dear Harriet is my &s;ubject; and her happine&s;s is, and has
<PB N="123" REF="124">
ever been, my only care, &s;ince I lo&s;t the hu&s;band of my youth, the dear man who divided with me that, and all my cares; who had a love for you equal to my own; and who, I think, would have given ju&s;t <HI>&s;uch</HI> advice. What would Mr. Shirley have thought? How would he, in the like ca&s;e, have acted? are the que&s;tions I always a&s;k my&s;elf, before I give my opinion in any material ca&s;es, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e which relate to you.</P>

<P>Good young creature, hold fa&s;t your principles, whatever befalls you. Look upon this world as you have been taught to look upon it. I have lived to a great age: Yet to look backward to the time of my youth, when I was not a &s;tranger to the hopes and fears that now agitate you, what a &s;hort &s;pace does it &s;eem to be! Nothing with-holds my wi&s;hes to be re|lea&s;ed, but my de&s;ire of &s;eeing the darling of my heart, my &s;weet orphan-girl, happy in a worthy man's pro|tection. O that it could be in&mdash;But &s;hall we, my dear, pre&s;cribe to Providence? How know we what <HI>that</HI> has de&s;igned for Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? <HI>His</HI> wel|fare is the concern of hundreds, perhaps. He, com|pared to us, is as the public to the private. I hope we are good people: <HI>Comparatively,</HI> I am &s;ure, we are good. That, however, is not the way by which we &s;hall be judged hereafter. But yet, to him, we are but as that private.</P>
<P>Don't think, however, my be&s;t Love, that I have lived too long to be &s;en&s;ible of what mo&s;t affects you. Of your plea&s;ures, your pains, I can and do partake. Your late hara&s;&s;ings, &s;o tender, &s;o lovely a blo&s;&s;om, co&s;t me many a pang; and &s;till my eyes bear witne&s;s to my &s;en&s;ibility, as the cruel &s;cenes are at times read to

me again, or as I recall them to memory. But all I mean is, to arm you again&s;t feeling too &s;en&s;ibly, when it <HI>is</HI> known, the event which is now hidden in the bo|&s;om of Providence, &s;hould it, as is but too likely, prove unfavourable.</P>
<P>You have a great deal of writing upon your hands. We cannot di&s;pen&s;e with any of that. But if you write to your aunt Selby (as the time till next Satur|day is &s;hort) that will be writing to us both.</P>

<P>I HAVE the favour of yours, and of my dear grand|mamma's, ju&s;t brought me. The contents are &s;o affecting, that, tho' in full a&s;&s;embly, as I may &s;ay, in this delightful family, I begged to be permitted to with|draw, to write to them. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;aw my con|fu&s;ion, my puzzle, what &s;hall I call it? To be charged &s;o home, my dear aunt!&mdash;<HI>Such apparent &s;truggles</HI>&mdash;And were they, madam, &s;o <HI>very</HI> apparent?&mdash;A <HI>young,</HI> a <HI>new pa&s;&s;ion!</HI>&mdash;And &s;o <HI>vi&s;ibly increa&s;ing!</HI>&mdash;Pray, ma|dam, if it be <HI>&s;o,</HI> it is not at its height&mdash;And is it not, while but in its progre&s;s, conquerable?&mdash;But have I been guilty of <HI>affectation?</HI> of <HI>re&s;erves?</HI>&mdash;If I have, my uncle has been very merciful to the <HI>aukward</HI> girl.</P>
<P>And you think it impo&s;&s;ible, madam, but <HI>he</HI> has &s;een women whom he could love, before he &s;aw me? Very likely! But was it kind to turn the word <HI>gratitude</HI> upon me in &s;uch a manner?</P>
<P>I do &s;ee what an amiable openne&s;s of heart there is
<PB N="125" REF="126">
in Lady D. I admire her for it, and for her other matronly qualities. What can <HI>you</HI> do, madam? What can <HI>I</HI> do? That is the que&s;tion, called upon as I am, by my grandmamma, as well as by you, to &s;peak &s;till plainer, plain as in your opinion I <HI>had</HI> &s;po|ken, and indeed in my own, now I read the free &s;en|tence, drawn out and &s;eparated from the re&s;t of the letter. My grandmamma forgives, and even prai&s;es me, for this &s;entence. She encourages me to &s;peak &s;till plainer. It is no di&s;grace, &s;he &s;ays, for a woman of virtue to be in Love with a worthy man. Love is a natural pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he tells me: Yet cautions me again&s;t &s;uffering it to triumph over my rea&s;on; in &s;hort, not to love till there &s;hall be a certainty of re|turn.&mdash;And &s;o I can love <HI>as I will, when</HI> I will, nay, <HI>whom</HI> I will; for if <HI>he</HI> won't have me, I am de&s;ired not to re&s;olve again&s;t marrying &s;ome other; Lord D. for example, if <HI>he</HI> will be &s;o good as to have me!</P>
<P>Well, but upon a full examination of my heart, how do I find it, now I am called upon by my two mo&s;t venerable friends, to <HI>undraw the curtain,</HI> and to <HI>put off the di&s;gui&s;es,</HI> through which every <HI>child in love|matters</HI> finds me out? Shall I &s;peak my whole heart?&mdash;To &s;uch <HI>&s;ympathizing</HI> friends &s;urely I ought. Well, then, I own to you, my honour'd grandmamma and aunt, that I cannot think of encouraging any other addre&s;s. Yet have I no hope. I look upon my&s;elf as pre&s;umptuous: Upon him as too excellent, and too con&s;iderable; for he has a great e&s;tate, and &s;till greater expectations: And as to per&s;onal and intellec|tual merit, what woman can de&s;erve him?&mdash;Even in the article of fortune only, you think that, in pru|dence, a man &s;o munificent &s;hould look higher.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed therefore, madam, in conformity to my grandmamma's advice, to tell Lady D. from me, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">'That I think her laudable openne&s;s de&s;erves like openne&s;s: That your Harriet <HI>was</HI> di&s;engaged in her affections, ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged, when you told her

What would I give to &s;ee Mr. Orme married to &s;ome very worthy woman, in whom he could be happy!</P>
<P>Finally, be&s;peak for me her Lady&s;hip's favour and friend&s;hip; but <HI>not</HI> to be renewed till my Lord is married&mdash;And may his nuptials be as happy as wi&s;hed to be by a mother &s;o worthy!

<P>But tell Lady D. all this in confidence, in the &s;trict|e&s;t confidence; among more general rea&s;ons regard|ing the delicacy of our &s;ex, for fear the family I am with, who now love, &s;hould hate, and, what would be &s;till wor&s;e, de&s;pi&s;e, your Harriet, for her pre&s;umption!&mdash;I think I could not bear that!&mdash;Don't mind this great blot&mdash;Forgive it&mdash;It <HI>would</HI> fall&mdash;My pen found it, before I &s;aw it.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Colnebrooke,</HI> <DATE><HI>Tue&s;day, March 7.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE I am, my dear Lucy, returned to this happy a&s;ylum: But with what different emotions from the fir&s;t time I enter'd it! How did my heart flutter, when one of Sir Charles's &s;ervants, who attended us on hor&s;eback, pointed out to us, at the command of the Ladies, the very &s;pot where the two chariots met, and the conte&s;t began. The recollection pained me: Yet
<PB N="128" REF="129">
do I not owe to that terrifying incident the friend&s;hip I am admitted into with &s;o amiable a family?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, ever obliging, has indulged me in my choice of having a room to my&s;elf. I &s;hall have the more lei&s;ure for writing to you, my dear friends.</P>
<P>Both &s;he and Lady L. are very urgent with me to &s;hew them &s;ome of the letters in our corre&s;pondence; and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;ays, if that will encourage me to oblige them, they will &s;hew me &s;ome of their brother's.&mdash;Who would not be tempted by &s;uch an ex|change? I am more than half-afraid&mdash;But &s;urely, in &s;uch an heap of &s;tuff as I have written, there is &s;ome|thing that I can <HI>read</HI> to them. Shall I be permitted, do you think, to have my letters returned me for this pur|po&s;e? The remarks of the&s;e Ladies on what I &s;hall think fit to &s;hew them, will be of great u&s;e in helping to &s;ettle my judgment. I know I have thrown out many things at random; and, being a young creature, and not pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>age of fancy,</HI> have, in all tho&s;e &s;en|timents which are not borrowed, been very &s;uperfici|al. How can it be otherwi&s;e?</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation in the coach turned upon their own family (for I put in my claim to Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on's former promi&s;e on that head); from which I ga|ther'd the following particulars.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on was one of the hand&s;ome&s;t men of his time: He had a great notion of magnifi|cence in living; and went deep into all the fa&s;hionable diver&s;ions, except gaming with cards and dice; tho' he ran into one as expen&s;ive, but which he called a nobler vice; valuing him&s;elf upon his breed of race-hor&s;es and hunters, and upon his kennel; in both which ar|ticles he was extravagant to profu&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>His</HI> father, Sir Charles, was as frugal as Sir Thomas was profu&s;e. He was a purcha&s;er all his life; and left his &s;on, be&s;ides an e&s;tate of 6,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year in England, and near 2,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year in Ireland, rich in money.</P>
<P>His Lady was of a noble family; &s;i&s;ter to Lord W.
<PB N="129" REF="130">
She was, as you have already been told, the mo&s;t ex|cellent of women. I was delighted to &s;ee her two daughters bear te&s;timony to her goodne&s;s, and to their own worth, by their tears. It was impo&s;&s;ible, in the character of &s;o good a woman, not to think of my own mamma; and I could not help, on the remem|brance, joining my tears with theirs.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois al&s;o wept, not only from tenderne&s;s of nature, and &s;ympathy, but, as &s;he owned, from re|gret, that &s;he had not the &s;ame rea&s;on to rejoice in a living mother, as we had to remember affectionately the departed.</P>
<P>What I have written, and &s;hall farther write, to the di&s;advantage of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on, I gather'd from what was dropt by one Lady, and by the other, at different times; for it was beautiful to ob&s;erve with what he&s;itation and reluctancy they mentioned any of his failings, with what plea&s;ure his good qualities; heightening the one, and extenuating the other. O my Lucy, how would their hearts have overflowed in his prai&s;es, had they had &s;uch a faultle&s;s father, and excellent man, as was my father! Sweet is the remembrance of good parents to good children!</P>
<P>Lady Grandi&s;on brought a great fortune to Sir Tho|mas. He had a fine poetical vein, which he was fond of cultivating. Tho' his fortune was &s;o ample, it was his per&s;on, and his ver&s;es, that won the Lady from &s;e|veral competitors. He had not, however, <HI>her</HI> judg|ment. He was a poet; and I have heard my grand|father &s;ay, that to be a poet, requires an heated ima|gination, which often runs away with the judgment.</P>
<P>This Lady took the con&s;ent of all her friends in her choice; but here &s;eemed an hint to drop from Lady L. that they con&s;ented, <HI>becau&s;e</HI> it was her choice; for Sir Thomas, from the day he enter'd upon his e&s;tate, &s;et out in a way that every-body concluded would di|mini&s;h it.</P>
<P>He made, however, a <HI>kind</HI> hu&s;band, as it is called,
<PB N="130" REF="131">
His good-&s;en&s;e and his politene&s;s, and the pride he took to be thought one of the be&s;t-bred men in Eng|land, &s;ecured her <HI>complai&s;ant</HI> treatment. But Lady Grandi&s;on had qualities that de&s;erved one of the be&s;t and tendere&s;t of men. Her eye and her ear had cer|tainly mi&s;led her. I believe a woman, who choo&s;es a man whom every-body admires, if the man be not good, mu&s;t expect that he will have calls and inclina|tions, that will make him think the character of a dome&s;tic man beneath him.</P>
<P>She endeavoured, at &s;etting out, to engage his <HI>com|panionablene&s;s</HI>&mdash;&s;hall I call it? She was fond of her hu&s;band. He had rea&s;on to be, and <HI>was,</HI> proud of his wife: But when he had &s;hew'd her every-where, and &s;he began to find her&s;elf in circum&s;tances which ought to dome&s;ticate a wife of a much gayer turn than Lady Grandi&s;on pretended to have, he gave way to his pre|dominant bya&s;s; and after a while, leaving the whole family-care to her, for her excellence in every branch of which he was continually prai&s;ing her (He did her that ju&s;tice) he was but little at home in the &s;ummer; and, in the winter, was generally engaged four months in the diver&s;ions of this great town; and was the common patron of all the performers whether at plays, operas, or concerts.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;etting out in this way, he was &s;olicitous to carry his Lady with him to town. She always chear|fully accepted of his invitation, when &s;he &s;aw he was urgent with her to go. She would not give a pre|tence for &s;o gay a man to throw off that regard to ap|pearances, which pride made him willing to keep up. But afterwards, his invitations growing fainter and fainter, and &s;he finding that her pre&s;ence lengthened the time of his &s;tay in town, and added greatly to his expences (for he never would abate, when they were together, of that magnificence in which he delighted to live in the country) &s;he declined going up: And having by this time her three children, &s;he found it was
<PB N="131" REF="132">
as agreeable to Sir Thomas, as to her&s;elf, that &s;he &s;hould turn her thoughts wholly to the dome&s;tic du|ties. Lady Grandi&s;on, when &s;he found that &s;he could not bring Sir Thomas to le&s;&s;en his great expences &s;up|po&s;ed it to be wi&s;dom to endeavour, to the utmo&s;t of her power, to enable him to &s;upport them without di&s;credit to him&s;elf, or vi&s;ible hurt to his family. The children were young, and were not likely to make demands upon him for many years to come.</P>
<P>Here was a mother, my dear! Who will &s;ay, that mothers may not be the <HI>mo&s;t</HI> u&s;eful per&s;ons in the fa|mily, when they do their duty, and their hu&s;bands are defective in theirs? Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on's delights centred in him&s;elf, Lady Grandi&s;on's in her hu&s;band and children. What a &s;uperiority, what an inferio|rity!</P>
<P>Yet had this Lady, with the be&s;t oeconomy, no nar|rowne&s;s in her heart. She was beloved for her gene|ro&s;ity and benevolence. Her poor neighbours adored her. Her table was plenteous. She was ho&s;pitable, as well from the largene&s;s of her own heart, as to give credit to her bu&s;band; and &s;o far to accommodate her|&s;elf to his ta&s;te, as that too great a difference might not be &s;een between his ab&s;ence and pre&s;ence. As oc|ca&s;ions offer'd, &s;he would confer benefits in the name of an hu&s;band, whom, perhaps, &s;he had not &s;een of months, and knew not whether &s;he might &s;ee for months to come. She was &s;atisfied, tho' hers was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> merit, with the <HI>&s;econd</HI> merit reflected from that &s;he gave him: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I am but Sir Thomas's almoner: I know I &s;hall plea&s;e Sir Thomas by doing this: Sir Thomas would have done thus: Perhaps he would have been more bountiful had he been pre&s;ent."</Q></P>
<P>He had been once ab&s;ent from this admirable wife &s;ix whole months, when he left her but for one: He de&s;igned only an excur&s;ion to Paris when he &s;et out; but, when in company as gay as him&s;elf, while he was there, he extended his tour; and, what was &s;till more
<PB N="132" REF="133">
inexcu&s;able, he let his Lady hear from him by &s;econd|hand only. He never wrote one line to her with his own; yet, on his return, affected to &s;urpri&s;e her by a &s;udden appearance, when &s;he knew not that he was in England.</P>
<P>Was not this intollerably vain in him? The mo|ment he appeared, &s;o &s;ecure was he of his Lady's unmerited Love, that he &s;uppo&s;ed the joy &s;he would break out into, would bani&s;h from her thoughts all memory of his pa&s;t unkindne&s;s.</P>
<P>He a&s;k'd her, however, after the fir&s;t emotions (for &s;he received him with real joy) If &s;he could ea&s;ily for|give him?&mdash;Forgive you, Sir?&mdash;Yes, if you can for|give your&s;elf.</P>
<P>This he called &s;evere. Well he might; for it was ju&s;t. Lady Grandi&s;on's goodne&s;s was founded in principle; not in tamene&s;s or &s;ervility.</P>
<P>Be not &s;erious, Sir Thomas, &s;aid my Lady; and flung her arms about him. You know, by your que|&s;tion, you were unkind. Not one line from your own hand neither&mdash;But the &s;eeing you now &s;afe and well, compen&s;ates me for all the anxieties you have given me in the pa&s;t &s;ix tedious months&mdash;Can I &s;ay they were not anxious ones? But I pity you, Sir, for the plea&s;ure you have lo&s;t by &s;o long an ab&s;ence: Let me lead you to the nur&s;ery; or let the dear prattlers come down to receive their father's ble&s;&s;ing. How delightful is their dawning rea&s;on! Their improvements exceed my hopes: Of what plea&s;ure do you deprive your&s;elf by the&s;e long ab&s;ences!</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, let me write on. I am upon a &s;weet &s;ubject. Why will you tear me from it? Who, Lucy, would not almo&s;t wi&s;h to be the wife, the half-&s;lighted wife, of a gay Sir Thomas, to be a Lady Grandi&s;on?</P>
<P>One reflexion, my dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, let me make, before I attend you; left I &s;hould lo&s;e it: What man who now, at one view, takes in the whole gay,
<PB N="133" REF="134">
fluttering life of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on, tho' young, gay, and flutterring, him&s;elf, can propo&s;e to be more happy than Sir Thomas thought him&s;elf? What wo|man, who, in like manner, can take in the whole, u&s;eful, prudent, &s;erene, benevolent, life of Lady Gran|di&s;on, whatever turn to plea&s;ure, le&s;s &s;olid, and more airy, &s;he may have, &s;ees not, from this imperfect &s;ketch, all that they &s;hould wi&s;h to be; and the tran|&s;itory vanity of the one, and the &s;olid happine&s;s that mu&s;t attend the other, as well here as hereafter?</P>
<P>Dear Lady!&mdash;had you not hurried me &s;o, how much better &s;hould I have expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf!</P>
<P>I come. I come.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In continuation.</HEAD>
<P>MISS Grandi&s;on has been making me read aloud &s;ome part of the letter I had ju&s;t writ to you, Lucy. We know, &s;aid &s;he, it is about <HI>us;</HI> but we &s;hall think what you have written, greatly to our di&s;|advantage, if we cannot hear &s;ome of it. Then &s;he in&s;i&s;ted (&s;he is an arbitrary dear creature) on my giv|ing the company [It was at tea, and Lord L. pre&s;ent] &s;uch hi&s;tories as &s;he &s;hould call for of my own family. On this condition only, &s;aid &s;he, will we con&s;ent to be made fully known, as I find we &s;hall, if I do not &s;teal away your pen and ink, to <HI>our</HI> grandmother Shirley, <HI>our</HI> aunt Selby, and even to <HI>our</HI> Lucy.</P>
<P>Do not you think, Lucy, I ran on with plea&s;ure in de&s;cribing the per&s;ons and tempers of my father and mother, and relating their fortunes, loves, difficul|ties; as my grandmamma and aunt had enabled me to do, from what they u&s;ed to recount in many a long &s;ummer-day, and in many a winter-evening, as we girls &s;at at work&mdash;Happy memorials!&mdash;Ay, but do
<PB N="134" REF="135">
you believe &s;he did not que&s;tion me about later events? She did, indeed, call upon me for two other hi&s;tories.</P>
<P>And of whom? methinks you a&s;k.</P>
<P>I won't tell <HI>you,</HI> Lucy: But if my <HI>aunt</HI> &s;hould be &s;o|licitous to know, and &s;hould <HI>gue&s;s</HI> that my uncle's and hers (&s;o entertaining and in&s;tructive) was one of them; and if you, Lucy, &s;hould <HI>gue&s;s</HI> that the hi&s;tory of a young lady, who&s;e di&s;cretion got the better of her Love, and who cannot be dearer to her&s;elf than &s;he is to me, is the other&mdash;Why, perhaps neither my aunt nor you, my dear, may be much mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>Methinks I would fain ri&s;e now-and-then to my former <HI>&s;erene-pertne&s;s</HI> [Allow you of the words &s;o connected?]: But my heart is heavy.</P>
<P>They were delighted with a certain gentleman's hu|mourous character and court&s;hip; with his lady's pru|dence and goodne&s;s, in the one &s;tory; and in the other, with the young Lady's victorious di&s;cretion. They wi&s;h to be per&s;onally acquainted with each, and with my grandmamma. <HI>All</HI> the worthies in the world, my dear, are not in the Grandi&s;on-family!</P>
<P>BEFORE I re&s;ume the continuation of the Ladies family-hi&s;tory, let me a&s;k; Don't you think, my dear, that God has ble&s;&s;ed the&s;e happy children, for the &s;ake of their excellent mother? And who knows, but for their duty to their le&s;s-de&s;erving father? It is my no|tion, that one per&s;on's remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in duty, where there is a reciprocal one, does not ab&s;olve the other party from the performance of his. It is difficult, indeed, to love &s;o well a faulty or remi&s;s parent, as a kind and good one. But our duty is indi&s;pen&s;able; and where it is paid, a ble&s;&s;ing may the rather be expected, as the parent has not done his. If, <HI>when you do well and &s;uffer for it,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>ye take it patient|ly, this is acceptable with God.</HI>&mdash;Not to mention one con&s;ideration, which, however, ought not to be left out of the account; that a good child will be no

le&s;s benefitted by the <HI>warning,</HI> as Sir Charles no doubt is, from his father's unhappy turn; than by the <HI>exam|ple;</HI> as he is from that of his excellent mother.</P>
<P>Lady L. referred to the paper given in by the &s;hort|hand writer, for the occa&s;ion (as mentioned by Sir Charles) to which the&s;e three worthy Children owed the lo&s;s of &s;uch a mother <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Letter IV. p. 56.</NOTE>: And this drew her into a melancholy relation of &s;ome very affecting particu|lars. Among other things, &s;he &s;aid, her mother re|gretted, in her la&s;t hours, that &s;he had no opportu|nity that &s;he could think ju&s;t and honourable, to lay by any thing con&s;iderable for her daughters. Her jewels, and &s;ome valuable trinkets, &s;he hoped, would be theirs: But that would be at their father's plea|&s;ure. I wi&s;h, &s;aid &s;he, that my dear girls were to have between them the tenth part of what I have &s;aved&mdash;But I have done but my duty.</P>
<P>I have told you, Charlotte, &s;aid the Counte&s;s, what my mother &s;aid to me, a few hours before &s;he died; and I will repeat it to Mi&s;s Byron. After having up|on general principles, recommended filial duty, and brotherly and &s;i&s;terly love to us all; and after my bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter had withdrawn; My dear Careline, &s;aid &s;he, let me add to the general arguments of the duty I have been enforcing upon you all, one re&s;pecting your <HI>intere&s;t,</HI> and let your &s;i&s;ter know it. I am afraid there will be but a &s;lender provi&s;ion made for my dear girls. Your papa has the notion rive&s;ed in him, which is common to men of antient families, that daughters are but incumbrances, and that the &s;on is to be every|thing. He loves his girls: He loves you dearly: But he has often declared, that, were he to have entire all the fortune that de&s;cended to him from his father, be would not give to his daughters, marry whom they would, more than 5,000 <HI>l.</HI> apiece. Your brother loves you: He loves me. It will be in <HI>his</HI> power, &s;hould he
<PB N="136" REF="137">
&s;urvive your father, to be a good friend to you.&mdash;Love your brother.</P>
<P>To my brother afterwards &s;he &s;aid &s;omething: I believe, recommending his &s;i&s;ters to him; for we coming in, boy as he was in years, but man in be|haviour and under&s;tanding, he took each of our hands&mdash;You remember it, Charlotte [Both &s;i&s;ters wept] and kneeling down, and putting them in my mother's held-out dying hands, and bowing his face upon all three&mdash;All, madam&mdash;All, my deare&s;t be&s;t of mamma's, that you have enjoin'd&mdash;</P>
<P>He could &s;ay no more; and our arms were wet with with his tears.&mdash;Enough, enough, my &s;on; I di&s;tre&s;s you!&mdash;And &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her own arm&mdash;The&s;e are pre|cious tears&mdash;. You embalm me, my &s;on, with your tears&mdash;O how precious the balm!&mdash;And &s;he lifted up her head to ki&s;s his cheek, and to repeat her ble&s;&s;ings to the darling of her heart.</P>
<P>Who could refrain tears, my Lucy, on the repre|&s;entation of &s;uch a &s;cene?&mdash;Mi&s;s Jervois and I wept, as if we had been pre&s;ent on the &s;olemn occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But, my Charlotte, give Mi&s;s Byron &s;ome brief ac|count of the parting &s;cene between my father and mother. She is affected as a &s;i&s;ter &s;hould be&mdash;Tears, when time has matured a pungent grief into a &s;weet melancholy, are not hurtful: They are as the dew of the morning to the green herbage.</P>
<P>I cannot, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on&mdash;Do <HI>you,</HI> Lady L.</P>
<P>Lady L. proceeded&mdash;My father had long kept his chamber, from the unhappy adventure, which co&s;t him and us all &s;o dear. My mother, till &s;he was forced to take to her bed, was con&s;tantly his attendant: And <HI>then</HI> was grieved &s;he could not attend him &s;till.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, the moment, happy to her, long dreaded by us, the relea&s;ing moment, approached. One la&s;t long farewel &s;he wi&s;h'd to take of the man, who had been <HI>ever</HI> dear to her; and who had co&s;t her <HI>&s;o</HI> dear. He was told of her de&s;ire to be lifted to his bed-&s;ide in

<P>I have endeavour'd, &s;aid my mother, in broken &s;entences&mdash;It was my wi&s;h&mdash;It was my pride: In|deed, my chiefe&s;t pride, to be a good wi&s;e!&mdash;</P>

My father looked earne&s;tly to us all&mdash;He could not &s;peak.</P>

<P>My father began to accu&s;e him&s;elf. My brother, with the piety of the patriarch's two be&s;t &s;ons, retired, that he might not hear his father's confe&s;&s;ion. We followed him to the farther end of the room. The manly youth &s;at down between us, and held an hand of each between his: His noble heart was &s;often'd: He two or three times li&s;ted the hand of each to his lips.

<P>My mother retained to the la&s;t that genero&s;ity of mind which had ever di&s;tingui&s;hed her. She would not permit my father to proceed with his &s;elf&punc;accu&s;ation: Let us look forward, my deare&s;t, my only Love, &s;aid &s;he. I have a ble&s;&s;ed hope before me: I pity as well

<P>She turned her head from him, &s;unk upon her pil|lows, and fainted, and &s;o &s;aw not, had not the <HI>grief</HI> to &s;ee, the &s;tronger heart of my father overcome; for he fainted away, and was carried out in his chair by the &s;ervants who brought him in.

<HEAD>LETTER XIII. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;on was incon&s;olable upon his mother's death. He loved his father, but next to adored his mo|ther. His father, tho' he had given &s;o little attention to his education, was exce&s;&s;ively fond of him: And, no doubt, but he the more ea&s;ily &s;atisfied him&s;elf on this head, as he knew his remi&s;&s;ne&s;s was &s;o well &s;up|plied by his lady's care, which mingled with the cares of the ma&s;ters of the &s;everal &s;ciences, who came home to him, at her de&s;ire.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="142">
A deep melancholy having &s;eized the young gentle|man on a lo&s;s &s;o irreparable, his father, who him&s;elf was greatly grieved, and the more, as he could not but reproach him&s;elf as having at lea&s;t ha&s;ten'd that lo&s;s, was alarmed for his &s;on; and yielded to the entreaties of General W. brother of Lord W. to permit him to travel. The General recommended for a governor to the young gentleman, an officer under him, who had been wounded, and obliged to quit the military &s;er|vice. Sir Thomas allowed his &s;on 800 <HI>l.</HI> a year, from the day of his &s;etting out on his travels, which he aug|mented afterwards to 1,000 <HI>l.</HI> Sir Charles was about &s;eventeen when his mother died.</P>
<P>The two daughters were taken by Lady W. But &s;he dying in about twelve-months after Lady Grandi|&s;on, they returned to their father; who, by that time, had pretty well got over his grief for the lo&s;s of his Lady, and was quite recovered of the wounds which he received in the duel that co&s;t her her life.</P>
<P>He plac'd over his daughters, as governe&s;s (though they both took exceptions at that title, &s;uppo&s;ing them|&s;elves of age to manage for them&s;elves) the widow of one of his gay friends, Oldham by name, who&s;e for|tune had not held out as Sir Thomas's had done. Men of &s;trong health, I have heard my grandfather &s;ay, and of a riotous turn, &s;hould not, in mere <HI>compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> keep company with men of feebler con&s;titutions, and make them the companions of their riots. So may one &s;ay, I believe, that extravagant men, of great and &s;mall fortunes, are equally ill-&s;uited; &s;ince the ex|pences which will but &s;hake the one, will quite de|moli&s;h the other.</P>
<P>Mrs. Oldham had fine qualities, and was an oeco|nomi&s;t. She de&s;erved a better hu&s;band, than had fal|len to her lot; and the young Ladies having had a foundation laid by a &s;till more excellent manager, re|ceived no &s;mall advantage from her &s;kill in family af|fairs. But it was related to me with reluctance, and
<PB N="142" REF="143">
as what I mu&s;t know on a further acquaintance with their family, if they did not tell it to me, that Sir Thomas was grateful to this Lady in a way that co&s;t her her reputation. She was obliged, in &s;hort, in little more than a twelvemonth, to quit the country, and to come up to town. She had an indi&s;po&s;ition, which kept her from going abroad for a month or two.</P>
<P>Lady L. being then about nineteen, and Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on about &s;ixteen, they had &s;pirit enough to oppo&s;e the return of this Lady to her charge. They under|took them&s;elves to manage every-thing at the capital &s;eat in Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas had another &s;eat in E&s;&s;ey. Thither, on the reluctance of the young Ladies to receive again Mrs. Oldham, he carried her; and they, as well as every-body el&s;e, for &s;ome time, apprehended they were actually married. She was hand&s;ome; well de|&s;cended; and tho' &s;he became &s;o unhappily &s;en&s;ible of the favours and pre&s;ents by which Sir Thomas made way to her heart, &s;he had an untainted character when he took her as a governe&s;s to the young La|dies.</P>
<P>Was not Sir Thomas very, very faulty, with re|gard to this poor woman?&mdash;She had already &s;uffered enough from a bad hu&s;band, to whom &s;he remark|ably well perform'd her duty.&mdash;Poor woman!&mdash;The example to his own daughters was an abominable one. She was the relict of his friend: She was under his protection: Thrown into it by her unhappy circum|&s;tances.&mdash;Were not the&s;e great aggravations to his crime? Happy for tho&s;e parents who live not to &s;ee &s;uch cata&s;trophes as attended this child! This dar|ling, it &s;eems: Not unde&s;ervedly &s;o; and whom they thought they had not unhappily married to Mr. Old|ham&mdash;And he, poor man! thought him&s;elf not un|happy in Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on's acquaintance; tho' it ended in his emulating him in his expences, with a
<PB N="143" REF="144">
much le&s;s e&s;tate; in the ruin of his fortune, which indeed was his own fault; and in the ruin of his wife's virtue, which was more Sir Thomas's than hers.&mdash;May I &s;ay &s;o?&mdash;If I may not (&s;ince women, who&s;e glory is their cha&s;tity, mu&s;t not yield to temptation) had not the hu&s;band, however, &s;omething to an&s;wer for, who, with his eyes open, lived at &s;uch a rate, again&s;t his wife's dutiful remon&s;trances, and better example, as reduced her (after his death) to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of dependence on another's favour, and <HI>&s;uch</HI> another!</P>
<P>Sir Thomas was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with his daugh|ters, for re&s;i&s;ting him in the return of their governe&s;s. He had thought the rea&s;on of her withdrawing a &s;e|cret, becau&s;e he wi&s;h'd it to be one: And yet her di&s;|grace was, at the time, every-where talked of, but in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>This woman is &s;till living. She has two children by Sir Thomas, who are al&s;o living; and one by Mr. Oldham. I &s;hall be told more of her hi&s;tory, when the Ladies come to give me &s;ome account of their brother's</P>
<P>Sir Thomas went on in the &s;ame gay fluttering way that he had done all his life. The Love of <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> as it is called, was wrought into his habit. He was a <HI>&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ve</HI> to it, and to what he called <HI>freedom.</HI> He was deemed one of the be&s;t companions among men, and one of the gallante&s;t men among women. His advan|tages of per&s;on and mind were &s;nares to him. Mrs. Oldham was not the only one of her &s;ex with whom he was intimate: He had another mi&s;tre&s;s in town, who had a ta&s;te for all its gaieties, and who even a&s;|&s;umed his name.</P>
<P>He would row-and then, by way of excur&s;ion, and to &s;urpri&s;e the young Ladies, vi&s;it Grandi&s;on-hall; but tho' it was once the &s;eat he mo&s;t delighted in, neither gave, nor &s;eamed to receive, much plea&s;ure there; hurrying away on a &s;udden, as if he had e&s;caped from
<PB N="144" REF="145">
it; tho' never father had more rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the conduct and duty of daughters: And this he often declared, boa&s;ting of them in their ab&s;ence; but &s;nubbing, chiding, and &s;tudying to find fault with them, when pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>But what equally &s;urpri&s;ed and affected them, was, that his &s;on had not been a year abroad, when he pro|hibited them to write to, or corre&s;pond with him; and, by their brother's di&s;continuing to write to them, from about the &s;ame time, they &s;uppo&s;ed that he was under the &s;ame prohibition: And &s;o, it &s;eems, he was.</P>
<P>They pre&s;umed, their father's rea&s;on for this un|kind prohibition was, his fear that his gaieties would have been one of the &s;ubjects of the corre&s;pondence; and the rather, as tho&s;e gaieties were &s;o likely to af|fect all three in their fortunes.</P>
<P>The young Ladies, however, for &s;ome time, con|tinued writing to their brother. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, in mentioning this, &s;aid, in her u&s;u&s;al &s;prightly manner, that &s;he never had any notion of obeying unrea&s;onable commands; commands &s;o evidently unrea&s;onable as to be unnatural: And &s;he called upon me to ju&s;tify her in her notion. The Counte&s;s al&s;o de&s;ired me to &s;peak my mind on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I am apprehen&s;ive, &s;aid I, of children's <HI>partiality</HI> in this re&s;pect: If they make them&s;elves their own judges in the performance or non-performance of a duty, <HI>in|clination,</HI> I am afraid, will too often be their guide, rather than right rea&s;on. They will be too apt, per|haps, to call tho&s;e commands unnatural, which are not &s;o unnatural as this &s;eems to be.</P>
<P>But, Harriet, a&s;ked Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, would not you have written on, in the like circum&s;tances?</P>
<P>I believe not, replied I; and partly for this rea&s;on; becau&s;e I &s;hould have had no doubt but my brother would have the &s;ame prohibition; and I &s;hould only have &s;hewn my brother, as well as my father (were

<P>Your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ower regards the policy of the thing, Har|riet, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: But ought an unnatural command&mdash;</P>
<P>There &s;he &s;topt: Yet by her looks expected me to &s;peak.</P>
<P>I &s;hould have thought it hard; but that it was more meritorious to &s;ubmit, than the contrary. I believe I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed, that my father might have rea|&s;ons which might not appear to me. But pray, La|dies, how did your brother&mdash;</P>
<P>O, he was implicit&mdash;</P>
<P>Will you forgive me, ladies?&mdash;I &s;hould have been concerned, I think, that my brother, in a point of duty, tho' it were one that might be <HI>di&s;putable,</HI> &s;hould be more <HI>nice,</HI> more <HI>delicate,</HI> than I his &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>Well, you are a good girl, a very good girl, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: <HI>That,</HI> whether your doctrine be ju&s;t or not, is out of di&s;pute.</P>
<P>This prohibition gave the &s;i&s;ters the more &s;en&s;ible concern, as they were afraid it would lay a foundation for di&s;tance and indifference in their brother to them; on whom as their mother had pre&s;aged, they were likely, if he &s;urvived their father, to have a too great dependence; but more particularly at that time, as their brother had promi&s;ed, at his taking leave of them, to write a regular account of all that befel him, and of all that was curious, and worthy notice, in the courts and places he vi&s;ited: and had actually begun to do &s;o; and as he had a&s;ked their advice in relation to his governor, who proved not &s;o proper a per&s;on for that employment, as was expected; and to which they had an&s;wered, without knowing, for &s;ome time, what was the re&s;olution he took.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="147">
They a&s;ked their father, from time to time, after the welfare of their brother. He would an&s;wer them with plea&s;ure, and &s;ometimes with tears in his eyes, He is all that is <HI>dutiful, brave, pious, worthy:</HI> And would &s;ometimes add, <HI>God reward him!</HI> I <HI>cannot.</HI> But when he mentioned the word <HI>dutiful,</HI> he would look at them, as if he had in his thoughts their re&s;i&s;t|ing him in his intention of rein&s;tating their govern|e&s;s; the only time, they could recollect, that they had given him the &s;hadow of di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Ladies went on, and &s;aid, that Sir Thomas, in all companies, gloried in his &s;on. And once Lord W. who him&s;elf, on his Lady's death, openly indulged him&s;elf in liberties which before he was only &s;u&s;pected to take [O my Lucy! how rare a character, in this age, is that of a virtuous man!] told &s;ome gentlemen, who wonder'd that Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on could per|mit a &s;on &s;o beloved to be ab&s;ent from him &s;o many years, that the rea&s;on Sir Thomas gave was, that his &s;on's morals and his own were &s;o different, that he &s;hould not be able to bear his own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, if he con&s;ented to his return to England. The unhappy man was &s;o habituated to vice, that he could talk fa|miliarly of his gaieties to his intimates, &s;eeming to think them too well known for him to endeavour to conceal them; but, however, would add &s;ometimes, I intend to &s;et about altering my cour&s;e of life; and then will I &s;end for my &s;on. But, alas! Sir Thomas went on from year to year, only <HI>intending:</HI> He lived not to begin the promi&s;ed <HI>alteration,</HI> nor to &s;ee his &s;on.</P>
<P>Yet one awakener he had, that made him talk of be|ginning the alteration of his way of living out of hand, and of &s;ending for his &s;on; which la&s;t act was to be the fore-runner of his reformation.</P>
<P>It happen'd, that Mrs. Farnborough the woman he lived with when in town, was &s;truck with the &s;mall|pox, in the height of her gaiety and plea&s;ure; for &s;he
<PB N="147" REF="148">
was taken ill at the opera, on &s;eeing a Lady of her ac|quaintance there, who&s;e face bore too &s;trongly the marks of the di&s;temper, and who, it &s;eems, had made her fir&s;t vi&s;it to that place, rather than to a better. The malady, aided by her terror, proved mortal; and Sir Thomas was &s;o much affected with the warning, that he left town, and, in pur&s;uance of his temporary good re&s;olutions, went down to his daughters; talked of &s;ending for his &s;on; and, for &s;ome few months, lived like the man of &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding he was known to be.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON,</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>LORD L. returned from his travels about the time that Mrs. Farnborough was taken ill. He had brought &s;ome pre&s;ents to Sir Thomas from his &s;on, who took all opportunities to &s;end him over curi|o&s;ities, &s;ome of con&s;iderable value; which &s;erved at the &s;ame time to &s;hew his oeconomy, and his duty. He forgot not, in this way, his &s;i&s;ters, tho' his ac|companying letters were &s;hort, and merely polite, and &s;uch as required no other an&s;wer than thanks: Only they could di&s;cover by them, that he had warm wi&s;hes to be allowed to return to England, but &s;uch a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his father's plea&s;ure, as entirely to give up his own.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas &s;eemed fond of Lord L. And, &s;etting out, on Mrs. Farnborough's death, for Grandi&s;on|hall gave him an invitation to vi&s;it him there; for he would li&s;ten with plea&s;ure, an hour together, to him, or to any one, who would talk, and give him &s;ome account of his &s;on. How predominant mu&s;t tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e habits, be in his heart, which could take place of a Love &s;o laudably paternal!</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of this invitation, Lord L. attended
<PB N="148" REF="149">
him at the Hall; and there fell in Love with the elde&s;t of the young Ladies. He revealed his pa&s;&s;ion to her. She referred her&s;elf wholly to her father. Sir Tho|mas could not be blind to their mutual affection. Every-body &s;aw it. Lord L's pa&s;&s;ion was of the ar|dent kind; and he was too hone&s;t to wi&s;h to conceal it. But yet Sir Thomas would not &s;ee it. He be|haved, however, with great freedom and civility to my Lord; &s;o that the heart of the young Lady was in&s;en&s;ibly engaged; but he avoided &s;everal opportu|nities which the Lover had lain in wait for, to open his mind, and make propo&s;als.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, my Lord de&s;ired an audience of Sir Tho|mas, as upon a &s;ubject of the la&s;t importance. The Baronet, after &s;ome little delays, and not without &s;ome inau&s;picious reluctance, granted it: And then my Lord revealed his pa&s;&s;ion to him.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas a&s;ked him, if he had made it known to his daughter? And yet mu&s;t have &s;een, on an hundred occa&s;ions, at breakfa&s;t, at dinner, at tea, at &s;upper, how matters &s;tood with both the Lovers, if Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's plea&s;ant account of the matter may be depended upon.</P>
<P>Lord L. owned he had; and that he had a&s;ked her leave to make propo&s;als to her father, to whom &s;he wholly referred her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas &s;eemed unea&s;y; and oddly an&s;wer'd, he was &s;orry for it: He wi&s;h'd his Lord&s;hip had not put &s;uch notions in the girl's head. Both his daughters would now be &s;et a romancing, he &s;uppo&s;ed. They were, till now, mode&s;t young creatures, he &s;aid. Young women &s;hould not too &s;oon be &s;et to look out of them&s;elves for happine&s;s&mdash;He had known ma|ny quiet and orderly girls &s;et a madding by the no|tice of men. He did not know what bu&s;ine&s;s young fellows had to find out qualifications in other mens daughters, that the parents of tho&s;e daughters had not given them&s;elves lei&s;ure to di&s;cover. A daughter of
<PB N="149" REF="150">
<HI>his,</HI> he hoped, had not encouraged &s;uch di&s;coveries. It was to him but as <HI>ye&s;terday,</HI> when they were crow|ing in the arms of their nur&s;es; and now, he &s;uppo&s;ed, they would be &s;et a crowing after wedlock.</P>
<P>What an <HI>odd</HI> father was Sir Thomas, my Lucy!&mdash;His own life, it is evident, had pa&s;&s;ed away very plea&s;antly.</P>
<P>Indeed he could hardly bear to think, he added, of either of his daughters as marriagaeble yet. They have not been nur&s;ed in the town hot-beds, my Lord. They are &s;ober country-girls, and good hou&s;ewives. I love not that girls &s;hould marry before they have done growing. A young wife makes a vapouri&s;h mother. I forget their age&mdash;But twenty-&s;ix or twen|ty-eight is time enough for a woman, either for the &s;ake of mode&s;ty or di&s;cretion, to marry.</P>
<P>We may like <HI>gay</HI> men for <HI>husbands,</HI> my dear: Some of us do: But, at this rate, tho&s;e daughters mu&s;t be very good girls, who can make their be&s;t courte&s;ies to their mothers, and thank them for their <HI>fancies;</HI> or the fathers mu&s;t be more attentive to their growth than Sir Thomas was to that of his daughters.&mdash;What have I &s;aid?&mdash;I am here afraid of my uncle.</P>
<P>My Lord was &s;urpri&s;ed; and well he might. Sir Thomas had forgot, as Lady L. ob&s;erved, that he him&s;elf thought Mi&s;s <HI>W.</HI> was not too young at &s;even|teen, to be <HI>Lady Grandi&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord was a mode&s;t Man: He was begging (as it may be called) the young woman, whom of all the women in the world he loved be&s;t, of her father, who was a man that knew the world, and had long made a con&s;iderable figure in it, and who, for rea&s;ons which would have held with him, had he lived to &s;ee her <HI>forty,</HI> had no mind to part with her. Yet my Lord pleaded his pa&s;&s;ion, her great and good qualities, as acknowledged by him&s;elf; and mode&s;tly hinted at the unexceptionablene&s;s of his own character, and the favour he &s;tood in with his &s;on; not &s;aying the lea&s;t
<PB N="150" REF="151">
word of his birth and alliances, which &s;ome Lovers of his rank, would not have forgot: And, it &s;eems, he was right in forbearing to make the&s;e accidents a plea; for Sir Thomas valued him&s;elf upon his an|ce&s;try; and u&s;ed to &s;ay, that his progenitor, in James the Fir&s;t's time, di&s;graced it by accepting the title of Baronet.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas allowed &s;omething to the plea of his &s;tanding well with his &s;on: Let me tell you, my Lord, &s;aid he, that I &s;hall take no &s;tep in a family|affair of this con&s;equence, without con&s;ulting with my &s;on; and the rather, as he is far from expecting &s;o much of my con&s;ideration for him. He is the pride of my life.</P>
<P>My Lord de&s;ired, that his &s;uit might be put upon the i&s;&s;ue of his &s;on's approbation.</P>
<P>But pray, my Lord, what fortune do you expect with my girl? Well as you love her, I &s;uppo&s;e the return of her Love for yours, which you &s;eem not to doubt, will not be enough. Can the poor girl be a Counte&s;s without a confounded parcel of dro&s;s fa&s;ten'd to her petticoat, to make her weight in the other &s;cale?</P>
<P>My circum&s;tances, &s;aid my hone&s;t Lord L. permit me not, in di&s;cretion, to make that compliment to my Love, which my heart would with tran&s;port make, were they better: But I will lay them faithfully before you, and be determined by your genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>I could not but expect, from a young man of your Lord&s;hip's good-&s;en&s;e, &s;uch an an&s;wer as this: And yet I mu&s;t tell you, that we fathers, who know the world, expect to make &s;ome advantage of a knowledge that has co&s;t us &s;o much. I &s;hould not di&s;like a little more romancing in Love, from a man that a&s;ks for my daughter, tho' I care not how little of it is &s;hewn by my &s;on to another man's. Every father <HI>thinks</HI> thus, my Lord; but is not &s;o hone&s;t as to <HI>own</HI> it.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure Sir Thomas, that you would not think a man worthy of your daughter, who had no regard to
<PB N="151" REF="152">
any-thing, but the gratification of his own wi&s;hes; who could think, for the &s;ake of that, of involving a young Lady in difficulties, which &s;he never knew in her father's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Why, this, my Lord, is well &s;aid. You and I may afford to make hand&s;ome compliments to one another, while compliments only are expected. I have a good &s;hare of health: I have not quitted the world &s;o en|tirely, nor think I ought, as to look upon my&s;elf as the nece&s;&s;ary tool of my children, to promote their happine&s;s at the expence of my own. My Lord, I have &s;till a &s;trong reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures of this world. My daughters <HI>may</HI> be women grown: Your Lord&s;hip &s;eems to have <HI>found out,</HI> that they <HI>are;</HI> and has per|&s;uaded one of them, that &s;he <HI>is;</HI> and the other will be ready to think &s;he is not three years behind her. This is an inconvenience which you have brought upon me. And as I would be glad to live a little longer for my|&s;elf, I wi&s;h you to withdraw your &s;uit; and leave me to do as well as I <HI>can</HI> with my daughters. I propo&s;e to carry them to town next winter. They &s;hall there look about them, and &s;ee whom they could like, and who could like them, that they may not be liable to after-repentance, for having taken the fir&s;t man that offer'd.</P>
<P>My Lord told Sir Thomas, that he hoped there could not be rea&s;on to imagine, that any-thing could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from his addre&s;s, that &s;hould be incom|patible with the happine&s;s of a father&mdash;And was going on in the &s;ame rea&s;onable &s;train; but Sir Thomas in|terrupted him&mdash;</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not, my Lord, &s;uppo&s;e I can be a &s;tran|ger to whatever may be urged by a young man on this &s;ubject. You &s;ay you are in Love: Caroline is a girl that any-body may love: But I have not a mind &s;he &s;hould marry &s;o &s;oon. I know the inconvenience of early marriages. A man's children treading upon his heels, and <HI>&s;houldering him</HI> with their &s;houlders: In
<PB N="152" REF="153">
&s;hort, my Lord, I have an aver&s;ion to be called a grandfather, before I am a <HI>grey</HI> father [Sir Thomas was not put to it to try to overcome this aver&s;ion]. Girls will &s;tart up, and look up, and parents cannot help it: But what father, in the vigour of his days, would not <HI>wi&s;h</HI> to help it? I am not fond of their part|ner&s;hip in my &s;ub&s;tance. Why &s;hould I divide my fortune with novices, when, making the hand&s;ome allowances to them, that I do make, it is not too much for my&s;elf? My &s;on &s;hould be their example. He is within a year as old as my elde&s;t girl. On his future alliances I build, and hope to add by them to the con|&s;equence of all my family [Ah! Lucy!]. Girls are &s;aid to be women &s;ooner than boys are men. Let us &s;ee that they are &s;o by their di&s;cretion, as well as by &s;tature.&mdash;Let them &s;tay&mdash;</P>
<P>And here Sir Thomas abruptly broke off the con|ver&s;ation for that time; to the great di&s;tre&s;s of Lord L. who had rea&s;on to regret, that he had a man of wit, rather than a man of rea&s;on, to contend with.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas went directly into his clo&s;et, and &s;ent for his two daughters; and, tho' not ill-naturedly, ralli|ed t em both &s;o much on their own <HI>di&s;coveries,</HI> as he wickedly phra&s;ed it, and, on admitting Lord L. into the &s;ecret, that neither of them could hold up their heads, for two or three days, <HI>in</HI> his pre&s;ence: But, <HI>out</HI> of it, Mi&s;s Caroline Grandi&s;on found that &s;he was in Love; and the more for Lord L.'s generous attachment, and Sir Thomas's not &s;o generous di&s;|couragement.</P>
<P>My Lord wrote over to young Mr. Grandi&s;on, to favour his addre&s;s. Lady L. permitted me to copy the following an&s;wer to his Application.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honour of your Lord&s;hip's letter of the 17th. Never brother loved his &s;i&s;ters better than I do mine. As the natural effects of that Love.
<PB N="153" REF="154">
I receive with plea&s;ure the notification of your great regard for my elder &s;i&s;ter. As to my&s;elf, I cannot have one objection: But what am I in this ca&s;e? She is wholly my father's.

I am, my Lord, with equal affection and e&s;teem,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Lord&s;hip's faithful and obedient Servant.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Both &s;i&s;ters rejoiced at the peru&s;al of this affection|ate letter; for they were afraid, that the unnatural prohibition of corre&s;pondence between them and their brother had e&s;tranged his affections from them.</P>
<P>The particulars of one more conver&s;ation I will give you between my Lord and Sir Thomas, on this important &s;ubject; for you mu&s;t believe, Lord L. could not permit a matter of &s;uch con&s;equence to his own happine&s;s to go ea&s;ily off; e&s;pecially as neither of the two daughters were able to &s;tand their father's con|tinual raillery, which had bani&s;hed from the cautious eyes, and apprehen&s;ive countenances, of both Ladies, all indications of Love, tho' it reigned with the more ab&s;olute power in the heart of Mi&s;s Caroline, for that concealment.</P>
<P>In this conver&s;ation, my Lord began with a little more &s;pirit than he fini&s;hed the former. The Coun|te&s;s lent me my Lord's minutes of it; which he took for her to &s;ee, and to judge of all that pa&s;&s;ed at the time.</P>
<P>On my Lord's lively, but re&s;pectful addre&s;s to Sir Thomas on the occa&s;ion, the Baronet went directly into the circum&s;tances of my Lord, and his expecta|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="155">
Lord L. told him frankly, that he paid intere&s;t for 15000 <HI>l.</HI> for &s;i&s;ters fortunes; three of whom were living and &s;ingle: That he believed two of them would &s;oon be advantageou&s;ly married; and he &s;hould wi&s;h to pay them their portions on the day; and was contriving to do &s;o, by increa&s;ing the incumbrance that his father had left upon the fine&s;t part of his e&s;tate, to the amount of 5,000 <HI>l;</HI> which, and his &s;i&s;ters for|tunes, were all that lay upon a clear e&s;tate of 5,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year. After he had thus opened him&s;elf, he refer|red the whole to Sir Thomas's con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>My advice, my Lord, is this, &s;aid the Baronet; That you &s;hould by no means think of marriage till you are clear of the world. You will have 10,000 <HI>l.</HI> to pay directly: You will have the intere&s;t of 10,000 <HI>l.</HI> more to pay: And you men of title, on your mar|riages, whather you like o&s;tentation or not, mu&s;t be o&s;tentatious. Your equipages, your hou&s;es, your fur|niture&mdash;A certain increa&s;e of expence&mdash;By no means, my Lord L. think of marriage till you are quite clear of the world, unle&s;s you could meet with &s;ome rich widow or heire&s;s, who could do the bu&s;ine&s;s at once.</P>
<P>Lord L. could only, at fir&s;t, urge his pa&s;&s;ion, [He dur&s;t not his daughter's affection and the happine&s;s of both, which were at &s;take]. Sir Thomas oppo&s;ed di&s;cretion to that plea. Poor <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> Lucy, would be a&s;hamed to &s;ee the &s;un, if <HI>di&s;cretion</HI> were always to be attended to, in treaties of this kind.</P>
<P>Afterwards he told Sir Thomas, that he would ac|cept the Lady upon his own terms. He be&s;ought his con&s;ent to their nuptials. He would wait his own time and plea&s;ure. He would be content, if he gave not Mi&s;s Caroline a &s;ingle &s;hilling.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas was fretful&mdash;And &s;o, Lover-like, you would involve the girl you profe&s;s to love, in difficul|ties. I will a&s;k her, if &s;he wants for any-thing with me, that a mode&s;t girl can wi&s;h for? But, to be &s;erious, it is a <HI>plaguy</HI> thing for a man to be obliged, by the offi|cious
<PB N="155" REF="156">
<HI>Love,</HI> as it is called, of a pretender to his daugh|ters, to open his affairs, and expo&s;e his circum&s;tances to &s;trangers. I wi&s;h, my Lord, that you had let my girls alone. I wi&s;h you had not found them out in their country-retirement. I &s;hould have carried them to town, as I told you, in a few months. Women &s;o brought up, &s;o qualified, and hand&s;ome girls, are &s;uch rarities in this age, and men worth having are &s;o affrighted at the luxury and expen&s;ivene&s;s of the mo|dern women, that I doubted not but the characters of my girls would have made their fortunes, with very little of my help. They have <HI>family,</HI> my Lord, to value them&s;elves upon, tho' but &s;pin&s;ters. And let me tell you, &s;ince I &s;hall be thought a more unnatural man than I am, if I do not obey the pre&s;ent demand upon me to open my circum&s;tances, I owe my &s;on a great deal more than 30,000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>I don't under&s;tand you, Sir Thomas.</P>
<P>Why, thus, my Lord, I explain my&s;elf: My father left me what is called rich. I le&s;&s;en'd the ready mo|ney, which he had got together for a purcha&s;e he lived not to complete, a great deal. That I looked upon as a deodand: So was not an&s;werable for it: And as I was not married, my &s;on had no right in it. When I was married, and he was given me&mdash;</P>
<P>Forgive me, Sir Thomas: Your &s;on a <HI>right</HI>&mdash;And had not your other children&mdash;</P>
<P>No, my Lord: They were girls&mdash;And as to them, had I increa&s;ed my fortune by penuriou&s;ne&s;s, in&s;tead of living <HI>like a man,</HI> I was determined as to their for|tunes&mdash;</P>
<P>But, as I was &s;aying, when Lady Grandi&s;on died, I think (tho' every father does not; nor &s;hould I, were he not the be&s;t of &s;ons, and did he <HI>expect</HI> it) the pro|duce of her jointure, which is very con&s;iderable, &s;hould have been my &s;on's. As to what I annually allowed him, <HI>that</HI> it was my duty to allow him, as my &s;on, and
<PB N="156" REF="157">
for my own credit, had his mother not brought me a &s;hilling.&mdash;Then, my Lord, I have been obliged to take up money upon my Iri&s;h e&s;tate; which being a family|e&s;tate, my &s;on ought to have had come clear to him. You &s;ee, my Lord, how I expo&s;e my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You have a generous way of thinking, Sir Thomas, as to your &s;on. But a man of your &s;pirit would de|&s;pi&s;e me, if I did not <HI>&s;ay,</HI> that&mdash;</P>
<P>I have not &s;o generous a way of thinking for my daughters&mdash;I will &s;ave your Lord&s;hip the trouble of &s;peaking out, becau&s;e it is more agreeable from my|&s;elf than it would be for any other man to do it. But to this I an&s;wer, that the late Earl of L. your Lord&s;hip's father, had one &s;on and three daughters&mdash;I have one &s;on, and two. He was an Earl&mdash;I am but a &s;imple Baronet&mdash;If 5,000 <HI>l.</HI> apiece is enough for an Earl's daughters, half the &s;um ought to do for a Baronet's.</P>
<P>Your fortune, Sir Thomas&mdash;And in England, where e&s;tates&mdash;</P>
<P>And where living, my Lord, will be five times more expen&s;ive to you than it need to be, if you can content your&s;elf to live where your e&s;tate lies.&mdash;As for me, I have lived nobly. But had I been as rich as my father left me, 5,000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;hould have done with a daughter, I a&s;&s;ure you. You, my Lord, have <HI>your</HI> notions: I have <HI>mine.</HI> Money and a girl you expect from me: I a&s;k nothing of you.

Let me beg of you, ever-dear and ever-honour'd Sir, that you will not &s;uffer any difficulties, that I can join to remove, to oppre&s;s your heart with doubts for one moment. Are you not my <HI>father?</HI>&mdash;And did you not give me a mother, who&s;e memory is my glory? That I <HI>am,</HI> under God, is owing to you. That I am <HI>what I am,</HI> to your indulgence. Leave me not any-thing! You have given me an education, and I derive from you a &s;pirit, that, by God's ble&s;&s;ing on my duty to you, will enable me to make my own fortune: And, in that ca&s;e, the foundation of it will be yours! and you will be entitled, for that foundation, to my warme&s;t gratitude. Permit me, Sir, to add, that, be my income ever &s;o &s;mall, I am re&s;olved to live within it. And let me be&s;eech you to remit me but one half of your pre&s;ent bounty. My reputation is e&s;tabli&s;hed; and I will engage not to di&s;credit my father. All I have ever aimed at, is, to be in condition rather to lay, than to receive an obligation. <HI>That</HI> your goodne&s;s has always enabled me to do: And I am rich, thro' your munificence; richer, in your favour.</P>
<P>Have you any thought, Sir, of commanding me to attend you at Paris, or at the Hague; according to the hopes you gave me in your la&s;t?&mdash;I will not, if you do me this honour, <HI>pre&s;s</HI> for a return with you to my native country: But I long to throw my&s;elf at your feet; and, where-ever the opportunity of that happine&s;s &s;hall be given me, to a&s;&s;ure you per&s;onally of the in|violable duty of</P>

Mu&s;t not &s;uch a letter as this, Lucy, have &s;tung to the heart a man of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on's pride? If not, what <HI>was</HI> his pride?&mdash;Sir Thomas had as good an education as his &s;on: Yet could not live within the compa&s;s of an income of upwards of 7,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year. His &s;on called him&s;elf rich with 800 <HI>l.</HI> or 1,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year; and tho' abroad in foreign countries, de&s;ired but half that allowance, that he might contribute, by the other half, to le&s;&s;en the difficulties in which his fa|ther had involved him&s;elf by his extravagance.</P>
<P>His father, Lady L. &s;ays, <HI>was</HI> affected with it. He wept: He ble&s;&s;ed his &s;on; and re&s;olved for his &s;ake, to be more cautious in his wagerings than he had hi|therto been.

<P>MY Lord <HI>repeated</HI> his reque&s;t, that he might have Sir Thomas's con&s;ent to his nuptials, up|on his own terms; and promi&s;ed never to expect a &s;ingle &s;hilling in dowry, but to leave the whole of that to time, and to his own convenience and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>We know, &s;aid Sir Thomas, what all this means. You talk, my Lord, like a young man. You ought not to think (You once &s;aid it your&s;elf) of involving a young woman you love, as well as your&s;elf, in difficul|ties. I know the world, and what is be&s;t to be done, if you will think no more of my daughter. I hope &s;he has di&s;cretion. <HI>Fir&s;t Love</HI> is generally <HI>fir&s;t Folly.</HI> It is &s;eldom <HI>fit</HI> to be encouraged.

wife from the city. And the city now is as genteel, as polite, as the court was formerly. The wives and daughters of citizens, poor fellows! are apes of us gentry; and &s;ucceed pretty well, as to outward ap|pearance, in the mimickry. You will, by this means, &s;hake off all your father's &s;ins. I &s;peak in the lan|guage of young fellows, who expect a father to live &s;olely for them, and not for him&s;elf. Some &s;ober young men of quality and fortune, affrighted at the gaiety and extravagance of the modern women, will find out my girls: Who, I hope, will have patience. If they have not, let them pur&s;ue their inclinations: Let them take their <HI>fill of Love,</HI> as Solomon &s;ays; and if they run their heads into an hedge, let them &s;tick there by the horns, with all heart!</P>
<P>See, my dear, what a man a raki&s;h father is!&mdash;O my good Lady Grandi&s;on, how might your choice have puni&s;hed your children!</P>
<P>I pray to God, Sir Thomas, &s;aid my Lord, bowing, but angry; I pray to God, to continue me in a diffe|rent way of thinking from yours, if this <HI>be</HI> yours. Give me leave to &s;ay, you are too young a gentleman to be a father of grown-up children. But I mu&s;t love Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on; and &s;till if po&s;&s;ible, poor young Lady! more than ever, for what has pa&s;&s;ed in this conver|&s;ation. And &s;aying this he withdrew.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas was very angry at this &s;pirited &s;peech. He &s;ent for his daughter and forbad her to receive my Lord's addre&s;&s;es. He order'd her never to think of him: And directing Mi&s;s Charlotte to be call'd in, repeated his commands before her; and threatened to turn them both out of his hou&s;e, if they pre&s;umed to encourage any addre&s;s, but with his knowledge. And don't think, &s;aid he, of going on to <HI>engage your affecti|ons,</HI> as a &s;en&s;ual forwardne&s;s is called, and then hope to take advantage of <HI>my</HI> weakne&s;s, to countenance <HI>your own.</HI> I know the world: I know your &s;ex.&mdash;Your &s;i&s;ter, I &s;ee Charlotte, is a whining fool: See how
<PB N="160" REF="161">
&s;he whimpers! Begone from my pre&s;ence, Caroline! And remember Charlotte (for I &s;uppo&s;e this imperti|nent Lord's addre&s;s to your &s;i&s;ter will go near to &s;et you agog) that I expect, whether ab&s;ent or pre&s;ent, to know of any application that may be made to you, before your liking has taken root in Love, as it is cal|led, and while my advice may have the weight that the permi&s;&s;ion or di&s;&s;ent of a father ought to have.</P>
<P>They both wept, courte&s;ied, and withdrew.</P>
<P>At dinner, Mi&s;s Caroline begged to be excu&s;ed at|tending her gay and arbitrary father, being exce&s;&s;ive|ly grieved, and unfit, as &s;he de&s;ired her &s;i&s;ter to &s;ay, to be &s;een. But he commanded her attendance.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Charlotte Grandi&s;on told me what this wick|ed man [Shall I call Sir Charles Grandi&s;on's father &s;o?] &s;aid on the occa&s;ion: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Womens tears are but, as the Poet &s;ays, the &s;weat of eyes. Caroline's eyes will not mi&s;become them. The more &s;he is a&s;hamed of her&s;elf, the le&s;s rea&s;on will &s;he give me to be a&s;hamed of her.&mdash;Let me &s;ee how the fool looks, now &s;he is con&s;cious of her folly. Her ba&s;hful behaviour will be an half-confe&s;&s;ion; and this is the fir&s;t &s;tep to amendment. Tell her, that a woman's grief for not having been able to carry her point, has always been a plea&s;ure to me. I will not be robbed of my plea&s;ure. She owes it me for the pain &s;he has given me."</Q></P>
<P>Lord L. and &s;he had parted. He had, on his knees, implored her hand. He would not, he &s;aid, either a&s;k or expect a &s;hilling of her father: His e&s;tate would and &s;hould work it&s;elf clear, without injury to his &s;i&s;|ters, or po&s;tponing their marriage. Her prudence and genero&s;ity he built upon: They would enable him to be ju&s;t to every one, and to pre&s;erve his own credit. He would not, he generou&s;ly &s;aid, for the beloved daughter's &s;ake, utter one reflecting word upon her fa|ther, after he had laid naked facts before her. Tho&s;e, however, would too well ju&s;tify him, if he did. And
<PB N="161" REF="162">
he again urged for her hand and for a private mar|riage. Can I bear to think with patience, my deare&s;t Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, added he, that you and your &s;i&s;ter, according to Sir Thomas's &s;cheme, &s;hall be carried to town, with minds nobler than the minds of any wo|men in it, as adventurers, or <HI>female</HI> fortune-hunters, to take the chance of attracting the eyes and hearts of men, whether worthy or unworthy, purely to &s;ave your father's pocket? No, madam: Believe me, I love you not for my own &s;ake merely, tho' heaven knows you are dearer to me than my life, but for yours as well: And my whole future conduct &s;hall convince you, that I do. My Love madam, has <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> for its ba&s;is; and your worthy brother, once, in an argument convinced me, that Love might be <HI>&s;elfi&s;h?</HI> that <HI>friend|&s;hip</HI> could not; and that in a pure flame they could not be di&s;united; and when they were, that Love was a cover only to a ba&s;ene&s;s of heart, which taught the pretender to it to &s;eek to gratify his own pa&s;&s;ion, at the expence of the happine&s;s or duty of the object pretend|ed to be beloved.</P>
<P>See, my Lucy!&mdash;Did we Girls ever think of this nice, but ju&s;t, di&s;tinction before? And is not <HI>friend|&s;hip</HI> a nobler band than <HI>Love?</HI>&mdash;But <HI>is</HI> not Lord L. a good man? Don't you love him, Lucy?&mdash;Why have I not met with the&s;e notions before in the men I have known?</P>
<P>But Mi&s;s Caroline was not le&s;s generous than my Lord L. No &s;cheme of my father's &s;hall make me forget, &s;aid &s;he the merits of Lord L. Your Lord|&s;hip's affairs will be made ea&s;ier by time. I will not embarra&s;s you. Think not your&s;elf under any obliga|tion to me. Whenever any opportunity offers to make you ea&s;y all at once (for a mind &s;o generous ought not to be laid under difficulties) embrace it: Only let me look upon you as my <HI>friend,</HI> till envy to an happier woman, or other unworthine&s;s in Caroline Grandi&s;on, make me forfeit your good opinion.</P>

Generous creature! &s;aid my Lord. Never will I think of any other wife while you are &s;ingle.

<P>YOU may gue&s;s what were my Lord's a&s;&s;urances on this generous confidence in him. They agreed upon a private corre&s;pondence by letters.&mdash;Ah! Lady L. was this <HI>quite</HI> right, tho' it came out happily in the event? Does not concealment always imply &s;omewhat wrong? Ought you not to have done <HI>your</HI> duty, whether your father did <HI>his</HI> or not?

Remember you not who &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye &s;hall take it patient|ly? But if, when ye do well, and &s;uffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with God."</Q>&mdash;
<PB N="163" REF="164">
But you, Lady L. had lo&s;t your excellent mother ve|ry early.</P>
<P>The worthy young Lady would not, however, be prevailed upon to con&s;ent to a private marriage; and my Lord took leave of her. Their parting was ex|tremely tender; and the amiable Caroline, in the &s;oft|ne&s;s of her heart, overcome by my Lord's prote&s;ta|tions of everla&s;ting Love to her, in preference to all the women on earth, voluntarily a&s;&s;ured him, that &s;he never would receive any other propo&s;al, while he was living, and &s;ingle.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas &s;hew'd him&s;elf &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ed with Lord L. for the freedom of his la&s;t &s;peech, that my Lord cho&s;e not to de&s;ire another audience of him; and yet, being unwilling to widen the difference, he took polite leave of the angry Baronet in a letter, which was put into his hands ju&s;t before he had com|manded Mi&s;s Caroline to attend him at dinner, which &s;he had begged to be excu&s;ed doing.</P>
<P>Don't you pity the young Lady, Lucy, in this &s;itu|ation? Lord L. having but a little before taken leave of her, and &s;et out for London.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Charlotte told her &s;i&s;ter, that, were it &s;he, &s;he &s;hould hardly have &s;uffer'd Lord L. to go away by <HI>him&s;elf</HI>&mdash;Were it but to avoid an interview with a fa|ther who &s;eem'd to have been too much u&s;ed to wo|mens tears to be moved by them; and who had &s;uch a &s;atyrical vein, and &s;uch odd notions of Love.</P>
<P>I was very earne&s;t to know what pa&s;&s;ed at this dinner-time.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;aid, It is be&s;t for <HI>me</HI> to an&s;wer Mi&s;s Byron's curio&s;ity, I believe; as I was a &s;tander-by, and only my father and &s;i&s;ter were the players.</P>
<P><HI>Players!</HI> repeated Lady L.&mdash;It was a cruel &s;cene. And I believe, Mi&s;s Byron, it will make you not won|der, that I liked Lord L. much the better for being rather a man of under&s;tanding than a man of wit.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on began as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="165">
I went up with my father's <HI>peremptory,</HI> as I may call it, to my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>O my dear mamma! &s;aid Caroline, when &s;he found &s;he mu&s;t go down, on what a new occa&s;ion do I want your &s;weet mediation! But, Charlotte, I can neither <HI>walk</HI> nor <HI>&s;tand</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>You mu&s;t then lean upon me, my dear, and <HI>creep:</HI> Love will creep, they &s;ay, where it cannot go.</P>
<P>Wicked girl! interrupted Lady L. I remember that was what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>I &s;aid it to make you &s;mile, if I could, and take courage: But you know I was in tears for you, not|with&s;tanding,</P>
<P>You thought of what might befal your&s;elf, Char|lotte.</P>
<P>So I did. We never, I believe, <HI>properly</HI> feel for others, what does not touch our&s;elves.</P>
<P>A compa&s;&s;ionate heart, &s;aid I, is a ble&s;&s;ing, though a painful one: And yet there would be no &s;upporting life, if we felt quite as poignantly for others as we do for our&s;elves. How happy was it for my Charlotte, that &s;he could &s;mile, when the father's apprehended lecture was intended for the u&s;e of both!</P>
<P>I thank you for this, Harriet. You will not be long my creditor&mdash;But I will proceed.</P>
<P>Caroline took my advice. She leaned upon me; and creep, creep, creep, down &s;he crept. A fre&s;h &s;tream of tears fell from her eyes, when &s;he came to the dining-room door. Her tremblings were increa|&s;ed: And down &s;he dropt upon a window-&s;eat in the pa&s;&s;age: I can go no further, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>In&s;tantly a voice, that we knew mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, alarmed our ears&mdash;Where are you, Caroline! Char|lotte? Girls! where are you? The hou&s;ekeeper was in hearing, and ran to us: Ladies! Ladies! Your papa calls!&mdash;And we, in &s;pite of the weakne&s;s of the one, and the unwillingne&s;s of the other, recovered our feet; and, after half a dozen creeping motions more,
<PB N="165" REF="166">
found our&s;elves within the door, and in our father's &s;ight, my &s;i&s;ter leaning upon my arm.</P>
<P>What devil's in the wind now! What tragedy-movements are here!&mdash;What mea&s;ured &s;teps!&mdash;In &s;ome ca&s;es, all women are natural actre&s;&s;es. But come, Caroline, the play is over, and you mi&s;take your cue.</P>
<P>Good Sir!&mdash;Her hands held up&mdash;I wept for her; and for my own remoter ca&s;e, if you will, Mi&s;s Byron.</P>
<P>The prologue is yours, Caroline, Charlotte, I doubt not, is ready with her epilogue. But come, come, it is time to clo&s;e this farce&mdash;Take your places, girls; and don't be fools.&mdash;A pretty caution, thought I, &s;aid Mi&s;s Charlotte, when you make us both &s;uch!</P>
<P>However, the &s;ervants entering with dinner, we hemm'd, handkerchief'd, twinkled, took up our knives and forks, laid them down, and took them up again, when our father's eye was upon us; piddled, &s;ipped; but were more bu&s;y with our elbows than with our teeth. As for poor &s;i&s;ter Caroline, love &s;tuck in her throat. She tried to &s;wallow, as one in a quin&s;ey; a wry face, and a &s;train'd neck, denoting her difficulty to get down but a lark's mor&s;el&mdash;And what made her more aukward (I am &s;ure it did me) was a pair of the &s;harpe&s;t eyes that ever were &s;een in a man's head, and the man a father (the poor things having no mother, no aunt, to &s;upport their &s;pirits) ca&s;t fir&s;t on the one, then on the other; and now-and-then an overclouded brow, adding to our aukwardne&s;s: Yet &s;till more apprehen&s;ive of dinner-time being over, and the with|drawing of the &s;ervants.</P>
<P>The &s;ervants loved their young Ladies. They at|tended with very &s;erious faces; and &s;eemed glad when they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Then it was that Caroline aro&s;e from her &s;eat, made her courte&s;y, aukwardly enough; with the air of a boarding-&s;chool Mi&s;s, her hands before her.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="167">
My father let her make her honours, and go to the door, I ri&s;ing to attend her; but then called her back; I dare &s;ay, on purpo&s;e to enjoy her aukwardne&s;s, and to puni&s;h her.</P>
<P>Who bid you go? Whither are you going. Caro|line? Come back, Charlotte.&mdash;But it will be always thus: A father's company is de&s;pi&s;ed, when a girl gets a Lover into her head. Fine encouragement for a fa|ther to countenance a pa&s;&s;ion that &s;hall give him&s;elf but a &s;econd or third place, who once had a fir&s;t, in his childrens affections! But I &s;hall have rea&s;on to think my&s;elf fortunate, perhaps, if my children do not look upon me as their enemy.&mdash;Come back when I bid you.</P>
<P>We crept back more aukwardly than we went from table.</P>
<P>Sit down&mdash;We cro&s;s'd our hands, and &s;tood like a couple of fools.</P>
<P>Sit down when I bid you. You are confoundedly humble. I want to talk with you.</P>
<P>Down &s;at the two &s;impletons, their faces and necks all awry, and on the edge of their chairs.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on then gave the following dialogue. She humourou&s;ly, by her voice (an humble one for her &s;i&s;ter, a le&s;s meek one for her&s;elf, an imperious one for Sir Thomas) marked the &s;peakers. I will pre|fix their names.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Thomas.</HI> What &s;ort of leave has Lord L. taken of you, Caroline? He has &s;ent <HI>me</HI> a Letter. Has he &s;ent <HI>you</HI> one? I hope he did not think a per&s;onal leave due to the daughter, and not to the father.</P>
<P><HI>Charlotte.</HI> He thought you were angry with him, Sir, &s;aid I [Poor Caroline's an&s;wer was not ready].</P>
<P><HI>Sir Tho.</HI> And &s;uppo&s;ed that your &s;i&s;ter was <HI>not.</HI> Very well! What leave did he take of you, girl? woman? What do you call your&s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>Charlotte.</HI> Sir, my Lord L. I dare &s;ay, intended no di&s;re&s;pect to&mdash;</P>
<P>I might as well have been &s;ilent, Harriet.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="168">
<HI>Sir Tho.</HI> I like not your preface, girl, interrupted he&mdash;Tell me not what <HI>you</HI> dare &s;ay. I &s;poke to your &s;i&s;ter.&mdash;Come, &s;it upright.

A promi&s;ing pro&s;pect before me, with you <HI>both!</HI> But tell me, Caroline, do you love Lord L.? Have you given him hope that you will be his, when you can get the cro&s;s father to change his mind; or, what is &s;till better, out of your way for ever?

<P><HI>Caroline</HI> (weeping, at his &s;evere &s;peech). Whan can I &s;ay, Sir, and not di&s;plea&s;e you?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Tho.</HI> What!&mdash;Why, that you are all obedi|ence to your father. Cannot you &s;ay <HI>that?</HI> Sure you can &s;ay <HI>that.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Car.</HI> I may behave like a fool, Sir, but not unduti|fully. You frighten me, Sir. I am unable to hold up my head before you, when you are angry with me.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Tho.</HI> Tell me that you have broken with Lord L. as I have commanded you. Tell me, that you will never &s;ee him more, if you can avoid it. Tell me, that you will not write to him&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Car.</HI> Pardon me, Sir, for &s;aying, that Lord L.'s behaviour to me has been ever uniformly re&s;pectful: He reveres my papa too: How can I treat him with di&s;re&s;pect?&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>MISS Caroline aro&s;e: Four creeping &s;teps, her handkerchief at her eyes, brought her within her father's reach. He &s;natched her hand, quicken'd her pace, and brought her clo&s;e to his knees. Poor &s;i&s;ter Caroline! thought I: O the <HI>ty</HI>&mdash;And I had like at the time, to have added the &s;yllable <HI>rant</HI> to my&s;elf.&mdash;He pulled the other hand from her eye. The handkerchief dropt: He might &s;ee that it was wet and

heavy with her tears. Fain would &s;he have turn'd her blubber'd eye from him. He held both her hands, and bur&s;t out into a laugh&mdash;</P>
<P>And what cries the girl for? Why, Caroline, you <HI>&s;hall</HI> have a hu&s;band, I tell you. I will ha&s;ten with you to the London market. Will you be offer'd at Ranelagh market fir&s;t? the concert or breakfa&s;ting?&mdash;Or &s;hall I &s;hew you at the opera, or at the play? Ha, ha, hah!&mdash;Hold up your head, my amorous girl! You &s;hall &s;tick &s;ome of your mother's jewels in your hair, and in your bo&s;om, to draw the eyes of fellows. You mu&s;t &s;trike at once, while your face is new; or you will be mingled with the herd of women, who pro&s;titute their faces at every polite place. Sweet impatient &s;oul!&mdash;Look at me, Caroline. Then he laughed again.</P>
<P><HI>Car.</HI> Indeed, Sir, if you were not my father&mdash;</P>
<P>Well &s;aid, Caroline! thought I; and trod on her toe.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Tho.</HI> Hey-day! But what then?</P>

<P><HI>Car.</HI> I am not kindly u&s;ed. Indeed, Sir, you don't u&s;e me kindly. I hope I am <HI>not</HI> an <HI>amorous</HI> crea|ture, as you call me. I am <HI>not</HI> in ha&s;te to be marri|ed.

If I am di&s;po&s;ed to railly you, Ca|roline; if I am willing to pa&s;s off, in a plea&s;ant manner, a forwardne&s;s that I did not expect in my daughter; and for which, in my heart, I have de&s;pi&s;ed the daughters of other men, tho' I have not told the wenches &s;o; I will

<P><HI>Sir Tho.</HI> And is it nece&s;&s;ary for you to withdraw, to recollect your <HI>duty?</HI>&mdash;But you &s;hall an&s;wer my que&s;tion&mdash;How &s;tand you and Lord L.? Are you re|&s;olved to have him, and none other?&mdash;Will you wait for him, will he wait for you, till death has numbered me with my ance&s;tors?</P>
<P><HI>Car.</HI> O Sir! And &s;he look'd down after her dropt handkerchief. She wanted it; and would have with|drawn one of her hands to reach it; and when &s;he could not, the big tears running down her cheeks [Yet &s;he look'd pretty] down &s;he dropt on her knees&mdash;Forgive me, Sir&mdash;I dread your di&s;plea&s;ure&mdash;But mu&s;t &s;ay, that I am not an <HI>amorous</HI> girl: And, to con|vince you that I am not, I will never marry any man living, if it be not Lord L.</P>
<P>I all this time was in agitations for my poor &s;i&s;ter. I tired three chairs; and now look'd at her; now from her; then at my fingers ends, wi&s;hing them claws, and the man an <HI>husband,</HI> in&s;tead of a father. Indeed, Mi&s;s Byron, I could not but make Caroline's treat|ment my own; and, in fancy, not &s;o very remote, as you imagin'd, Lady L. Once I &s;aid to my&s;elf, If &s;ome Lord L. tenders him&s;elf to me, and I like him, I will not &s;tand all this. The fir&s;t moon-light night, if he urge me heartily, and I am &s;ure the par&s;on is ready, I will be under another protection, de&s;picably as I have always thought of runaway daughters!&mdash;Should I have done right, Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P>The example, Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! replied I&mdash;Such a mamma as you were ble&s;&s;ed with! The world that would have &s;at in judgment upon the flight of the daughter, would not have known the cruel treatment of the father. I believe, my dear, you are glad you

had not the trial: And you &s;ee how Lady L. is re|warded for her patient duty.</P>
<P>That's my good Harriet! &s;aid Lady L. I love you for your an&s;wer. But, Si&s;ter, you leave me in too much di&s;tre&s;s. You mu&s;t relea&s;e me from my knees, and &s;end me up to my chamber, as fa&s;t as you can.</P>
<P>A little patience, Lady L.&mdash;But what &s;ay my mi|nutes?&mdash;Mi&s;s Byron &s;eems all attention. This is a new &s;ubject to her. She never had any-body to con|troul her.</P>
<P>I think I could have borne any-thing from a father or mother, &s;aid I, had it plea&s;ed God to continue to me &s;o dear a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Fine talking, Harriet! &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. But let me &s;ay, that a witty father is not a de&s;irable cha|racter&mdash;By the way, ours was as cruel (Shall I &s;ay it, Lady L.? You are upon your knees, you know) to two very worthy &s;i&s;ters of his own: One of them ran away from him to a relation in York&s;hire, where &s;he lives &s;till, and as worthy an old maid &s;he is as any in the county: The other died before &s;he could get her fortune paid, or &s;he would have been married to a man &s;he loved, and who loved her: But &s;he left every &s;hilling of her fortune to her maiden &s;i&s;ter, and no|thing to my father.</P>
<P>It is well my brother is not in hearing, &s;aid Lady L. He would not have borne the hundredth part of what we have &s;aid. But &s;ufferers will complain. Re|member, however, Charlotte, that I am &s;till upon my knees.</P>
<P>See, my Lucy! Raki&s;h men make not either good hu&s;bands, or good fathers; nor yet good brothers.&mdash;But, no wonder! The narrow-hearted creatures centre all their delight in them&s;elves.&mdash;Finely do women choo&s;e, who, taken in by their &s;pecious airs, vows, prote&s;tations, become the abject properties of &s;uch wretches! Yet, a reformed rake, they &s;ay, makes the be&s;t hu&s;band&mdash;Again&s;t general experience this is &s;aid&mdash;
<PB N="176" REF="177">
But by whom? By the vulgar and the incon&s;iderate only, &s;urely!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on proceeded.</P>

<P>Yet you &s;hall not go, holding both her hands. And dare you thus declare your&s;elf?&mdash;What option, I again a&s;k you, is left me?&mdash;And yet Lord L. and you, as you pretended ju&s;t now, were determined only on a <HI>conditional</HI> court&s;hip as I &s;hould, or &s;hould not, <HI>approve</HI> of it!

<P>Poor Mi&s;s Caroline! &s;aid I, Lucy, to them both&mdash;I expected this cruel retort.</P>
<P>I fore&s;aw it, replied Lady L. And this kept me off &s;o long from declaring my preference of Lord L. to all the men in the world; as in ju&s;tice to his merit, my heart &s;everal times bid me do without &s;cruple.</P>
<P>Begone from my pre&s;ence, &s;aid Sir Thomas, pro|ceeded Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on&mdash;Yet he &s;till held her hands&mdash;That little witch!

I am now, from this hour, to be looked upon as your enemy, and not your father. But I will renounce you both; and permit your brother, the joy of my life, and the hope of my better days, to come over: And he &s;hall re|nounce you, as I do, or I will renounce him: And, in that ca&s;e, I &s;hall be a father without a child; yet three living by the be&s;t of women.

<P>Do you give me the lye, bold-face?&mdash;</P>
<P>Pray your honour&mdash;Good your honour&mdash;intreated hone&s;t Beckford: never were mode&s;ter young Ladies. They are noted all over the county for their mode&s;ty and goodne&s;s&mdash;</P>
<P>Woman, woman, argue not with me. Mode&s;ty never forgets duty. Caroline loves not her father. Lord L. has &s;tolen away her affections from me. Charlotte is of her party: And &s;o are you, I find. But take my commands in &s;ilence&mdash;A week longer they &s;tay not in this hou&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Beckford, throwing her&s;elf on her knees, repeated&mdash;Good your honour&mdash;</P>
<P>We both aro&s;e, and threw our&s;elves at his feet&mdash;</P>
<P>Forgive us! I be&s;eech you, forgive us!&mdash;For my mamma's &s;ake, forgive us!&mdash;&s;aid Caroline&mdash;</P>
<P>For my mamma's &s;ake, for my brother's &s;ake, dear Sir, forgive your daughters! cried I, in as rueful an accent.</P>
<P>And we each of us took hold of his open'd coat, both in tears; and Beckford keeping us company.</P>
<P>Unmoved he went on&mdash;I intend you a <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> girls. I know you want to be freed from my autho|rity. You are women-grown. The man who has daughters knows not di&s;comfort with them, till bu&s;y fellows bid them look out of their father's hou&s;e for that happine&s;s, which they hardly ever find but in it.</P>
<P>We are yours, my papa, &s;aid I&mdash;We are nobody's el&s;e&mdash;Do not, do not, expo&s;e your children to the
<PB N="180" REF="181">
cen&s;ures of the world. Hitherto our reputations are un&s;ullied&mdash;</P>
<P>Dear Sir, cried Caroline, throw us not upon the world, the wide world! Dear Sir, continue us in your protection. We want not to be in any other.</P>
<P>You &s;hall try the experiment girls&mdash;I am not fit to be your coun&s;ellor. Lord L. has di&s;tanced me with the one: The other calls upon her departed mo|ther to appear, to &s;hield her from the cruelty of an unnatural father. And Lord L. has the in&s;olence to tell me to my face, that I am too young a father to take upon me the management of women-grown daughters. And &s;o I find it. Blubber not, Beck|ford; a&s;&s;i&s;t your young Ladies for their departure. A week is the longe&s;t time they have to &s;tay in this hou&s;e. I want to &s;hut it up: Never more to enter its gates.</P>
<P>We continued our pleadings.</P>
<P>O Sir, &s;aid Caroline, turn not your children out of doors. We are <HI>daughters.</HI> We never more wanted a father's protection than now.</P>
<P>What have we done, Sir, cried I, to de&s;erve being turned out of your doors?&mdash;For every offen&s;ive word we beg your pardon. You &s;hall always have dutiful children of us. Permit me to write to my brother&mdash;</P>
<P>So, &s;o! You mend the matter. You want to intere&s;t your brother in your favour&mdash;You want to appeal to him, do you? and to make a &s;on &s;it in judg|ment upon his father!&mdash;Prate not, girls! Intreat not!&mdash;Get ready to be gone. I will &s;hut up this hou&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P>Where-ever you are, Sir, intreated I, there let us be&mdash;Renounce not your children, your penitent children.</P>
<P>He proceeded. I &s;uppo&s;e Lord L. will as &s;oon find out your per&s;on, Caroline, as he has your inclina|tions; &s;o contrary to my liking. As to you, Char|lotte, you may go down to your old aunt <HI>Prue</HI> in

York&s;hire: [He calls their aunt Eleanor &s;o, from the word <HI>Prude</HI>&mdash;Yet we have &s;een, Lucy, it was owing to him that this Lady did not marry]: She will be able to in&s;truct you, that patience is a virtue; and that you ought not to be in ha&s;te to take a fir&s;t offer, for fear you &s;hould not have a &s;econd.</P>
<P>Poor &s;i&s;ter Caroline! He look'd di&s;dainfully at her.</P>
<P>You are my father, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. All is welcome from you: But you &s;hall have no cau&s;e to reproach me. I will not be in ha&s;te. And here on my knees, I promi&s;e, that I will never be Lord L.'s, without your con&s;ent. I only beg of you, Sir, not to propo&s;e to me any other man.</P>
<P>My father, partly relented [partly, Harriet]: I take you at your word: And I in&s;i&s;t that you &s;hall not corre&s;pond with him, nor &s;ee him.&mdash;You an&s;wer not to that. But you know my will. And once more, an&s;wer or not, I require your obedience. Beckford, you may go. Ri&s;e, Caroline</P>
<P>And am <HI>I</HI> forgiven, Sir? &s;aid I&mdash;Dear Sir, forgive your Charlotte&mdash;[Yet, Mi&s;s Byron, what was my crime?]</P>
<P>Make the be&s;t u&s;e of the example before you, Charlotte: Not to imitate Caroline, in engaging your affections unknown to me&mdash;Remember <HI>that.</HI> She has <HI>her</HI> plagues in giving <HI>me</HI> plague. It is fit &s;he &s;hould. Where you cannot in duty follow the example, take the warning.</P>
<P>Beckford was withdrawn. He graciou&s;ly &s;aluted each girl: And thus triumphantly made them expre&s;s &s;orrow for&mdash;Do you know for what Harriet?</P>
<P>I wi&s;h thought I to my&s;elf, Lucy, that the&s;e boi&s;terous &s;pirits, either fathers or hu&s;bands, were not generally mo&s;t ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>But was Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's &s;pirit &s;o ea&s;ily &s;ubdued? thought I.</P>
<P>You &s;mile, Harriet. What do you &s;mile at?</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="183">
Will you forgive me, if I tell you?</P>
<P>I don't know.</P>
<P>I depend on your good-nature. I &s;miled to think, Lady L. how finely Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on has got up &s;ince that time.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> O the &s;ly girl!&mdash;Remember you not, that I was before your debtor?</P>
<P>A good hit, I prote&s;t! &s;aid Lady L. Yet Char|lotte was always a pert girl out of her father's pre&s;ence. But I will add a word or two to my &s;i&s;ter's narrative.</P>
<P>My father kept us with him till he read Lord L.'s Letter, which he open'd not till then, and plainly, as I &s;aw, to find &s;ome new fault with him and me on the occa&s;ion. But I came off better than I apprehended I &s;hould at the time; for I had not &s;een it. Here is a copy of it.</P>
<P>Lady L. allow'd me, Lucy, to take it up with me, when we parted for the night.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>PERMIT me, Sir, by pen and ink, rather than in per&s;on, as I think it will be mo&s;t acceptable to you, to thank you, as I mo&s;t cordially do, for the kind and generous treatment I have received at your hands, during a whole month's re&s;idence at Gran|di&s;on-hall, whither I came with intent to &s;tay but three days.</P>
<P>I am afraid I &s;uffer'd my&s;elf to be &s;urpri&s;ed into an undue warmth of expre&s;&s;ion, when I la&s;t went from your pre&s;ence. I a&s;k your pardon, if &s;o. You have a right in your own child. God forbid that I &s;hould ever attempt to invade it! But what a happy man &s;hould I be, if my Love for Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, and that right, could be made to coincide! I may have ap|peared to have acted wrong in your apprehen&s;ion, in applying my&s;elf fir&s;t to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: I beg, Sir, your pardon for that al&s;o.</P>
<P>But perhaps I have a &s;till greater fault to atone for. I need not indeed acquaint you with it; but had rather
<PB N="183" REF="184">
intitle my&s;elf by my ingenuou&s;ne&s;s to your forgivne&s;s, than wi&s;h to conceal any thing from you in any article of this high importance, whether you grant it me or not. I own then, that when I la&s;t departed from your angry pre&s;ence, I directly went to Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on, and on my knees implored her hand. I pre&s;umed that an alliance with me was not a di&s;graceful one; and a&s;&s;ured her, that my e&s;tate &s;hould work it&s;elf clear without any expectation from you; as it will, I hope, in a few years, by good management, to which I was &s;ure &s;he would contribute. But &s;he refu&s;ed me, and re&s;olved to await the good plea&s;ure of her father; yet giving me, I mu&s;t hone&s;tly add, conde&s;cending hopes of her favour, could your con&s;ent be obtained.</P>
<P>Thus is the important affair circum&s;tanced.</P>
<P>I never will marry any other woman, while there is the lea&s;t &s;hadow of hope, that &s;he can be mine. The conver&s;ation of the be&s;t of young men, your &s;on, for two months, in Italy, and one before <HI>that</HI> in &s;ome of the German courts, has made me ambitious of following &s;uch an example in every duty of life: And if I might obtain, by your favour, &s;o dear a wife, and &s;o worthy a brother, as well as &s;o amiable a &s;i&s;ter as Mi&s;s Charlotte, the happie&s;t man in the world would then be,</P>

<P>Yet my father, &s;aid Lady L. called it an artful Let|ter; and ob&s;erved, that Lord L. was very &s;ure of me, or he had not offer'd to make a propo&s;al to me, that de&s;erved not to be excu&s;ed.

Swift, for often painting a dunghil, and for his abominable Yahoe &s;tory, was complimented with this knowledge: But I hope, that the character of human nature, the character of creatures made in the image of the deity, is not to be taken from the overflowings of &s;uch dirty imagi|nations.</P>
<P>What company, my dear, mu&s;t tho&s;e men be &s;up|po&s;ed to have generally kept? How are we authori&s;ed to wi&s;h (only that good is often produced out of evil, as is in&s;tanced in two &s;uch daughters, and &s;uch a &s;on) that a man of this ca&s;t had never had the honour to call a Lady Grandi&s;on by his name!

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>THUS far had the Ladies proceeded in their inte|re&s;ting &s;tory, when the Letters of my grand|mamma and aunt were brought me by a man and hor&s;e from London. By my an&s;wer you will &s;ee how much I was affected by the contents. The Ladies &s;aw my unea&s;ine&s;s, and were curious to know the cau&s;e. I told them from whence the Letters came, and what the &s;ubject was; and that my aunt was to give for me, next Saturday, an an&s;wer to Lady D. in per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="187">
I then retired to write. When I had di&s;patched the me&s;&s;enger, the Ladies wi&s;hed to know the re&s;o|lution I had come to. I told them I had confirmed my negative.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, with archne&s;s, held up her hands and eyes. I was vexed &s;he did. Then, Charlotte, &s;aid I, &s;pitefully, <HI>you</HI> would not have declined accept|ing this propo&s;al.</P>
<P>She looked earne&s;tly at me, and &s;hook her head. Ah, Harriet, &s;aid &s;he, you are an unaccountable girl! You will tell the truth; but not the whole truth.</P>
<P>I blu&s;hed, as I felt; and believe looked &s;illy.</P>
<P>Ah, Harriet, repeated &s;he; looking as if &s;he would look me through.</P>
<P>Dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on! &s;aid I.</P>
<P>There is &s;ome Northampton&s;hire gentleman, of whom we have not yet heard.</P>
<P>I was a little ea&s;ier then. But <HI>can</HI> this Lady mean any-thing particular? She cannot be &s;o ungenerous, &s;urely, as to play upon a poor girl, if &s;he thought her <HI>entangled.</HI> All I am afraid of, is, that my temper will be utterly ruined. I am not &s;o happy in my&s;elf, as I u&s;ed to be. Don't you think, Lucy, that taking one thing with another, I am in a &s;ituation that is very teazing?&mdash;But let me find a better &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE Ladies, at my reque&s;t, pur&s;ued their FAMI|LY-HISTORY.</P>
<P>Lord L. and Mi&s;s Caroline went on, hoping for a change in Sir Thomas's mind. He would, no doubt, they &s;aid have been overcome by the young Lady's duty, and my Lord L.'s genero&s;ity, had he not made it inconvenient to him&s;elf, to part with money.</P>
<P>He went to town, and carried his daughters with him; and, it is thought, would not have been &s;orry, had the Lovers married without his con&s;ent; for he prohibited anew, on their coming to town, my Lord's vi&s;its; &s;o that they were obliged to their &s;i&s;ter, as &s;he
<PB N="187" REF="188">
plea&s;antly had told Lady L. for contriving to for|ward their interviews.</P>
<P>Mean time, my Lord's affairs growing urgent, by rea&s;on of his two &s;i&s;ter's marrying, he gave way to the offers of a common friend of his and Lord W's, to engage that nobleman, who approved of the match, to talk to Sir Thomas on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Lord W. and the Baronet met. My Lord was earne&s;t in the cau&s;e of the lovers. Sir Thomas was not plea&s;ed with his interfering in his family affairs. And indeed a more improper man could hardly have been applied to on the occa&s;ion: For Lord W. who is immen&s;ely rich, was always de&s;pi&s;ed by Sir Tho|mas for his avarice; and he as much di&s;liked Sir Thomas for what he called his profu&s;ion.</P>
<P>High words pa&s;&s;ed between them. They parted in pa&s;&s;ion; and Sir Thomas re&s;enting Lord L's ap|peal to Lord W. the &s;i&s;ters were in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than before; for now, be&s;ides having incurred the in|dignation of their father, their uncle, who was always afraid that Sir Thomas's extravagance would reduce the children to the nece&s;&s;ity of hoping for his a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, made a pretence of their father's ill treatment of him, to di&s;claim all acts of kindne&s;s and relation to them.</P>
<P>What concern'd the &s;i&s;ters &s;till more, was, my Lord's declared antipathy to their brother; and that for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e his father (who, he was &s;ure, he &s;aid, could neither love nor hate in a right place) doated on him.</P>
<P>In this &s;ad &s;ituation were the&s;e Lovers, when over|tures were made to Sir Thomas for his younger daughter: But tho' Mi&s;s Charlotte gave him no pre|tence to accu&s;e <HI>her</HI> of beginning a Love-affair un|known to him; yet tho&s;e overtures never came to her knowledge from him, tho' they did from others: And would you have wondered, Harriet, &s;aid &s;he, with
<PB N="188" REF="189">
&s;uch treatment before my eyes as Caroline met with, if I had been provoked to take &s;ome ra&s;h &s;tep?</P>
<P>No provocation, reply'd I, from a father, can ju&s;tify a ra&s;h &s;tep in a child. I am glad, and &s;o, I dare &s;ay, are you, that your prudence was your &s;afeguard, when you were deprived of that which &s;o good a child might have expected from a father's indulgence, e&s;pecially when a mother was not in being.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on coloured, and bit her lip. Why did &s;he colour?</P>
<P>At la&s;t Sir Thomas took a re&s;olution to look into and regulate his affairs, preparative to the leave he in|tended to give to his beloved &s;on to come over. From <HI>his</HI> duty, di&s;cretion, and good management, he was &s;ure, he &s;aid, he &s;hould be the happie&s;t of men. But he was at a lo&s;s what to do with Mrs. Oldham and her two children. He doubted not, but his &s;on had heard of his guilty commerce with her: Yet he cared not, that the young gentleman &s;hould find her living in a kind of wife-like &s;tate in one of the family|&s;eats: And yet &s;he had made too great a &s;acrifice to him, to be unhand&s;omely u&s;ed; and he thought he ought to provide for his children by her.</P>
<P>While he was meditating this change of mea&s;ures, that he might &s;tand well with a &s;on, who&s;e character for virtue and prudence made his father half afraid of him, a propo&s;al of marriage was made to him for his &s;on by one of the fir&s;t men in the kingdom, who&s;e daughter, accompanying her brother and his wife, in a tour to France and Italy, &s;aw and fell in Love with the young Gentleman at Florence: And her brother gave way to his &s;i&s;ter's regard for him, for the &s;ake of the character he bore among the peo|ple of prime con&s;ideration in Italy.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas had &s;everal meetings on this &s;ubject, both with the brother, and the Earl his father; and was &s;o fond of bringing it to bear, that he had thoughts of re&s;erving to him&s;elf an annuity, and
<PB N="189" REF="190">
making over the whole of his e&s;tate to his &s;on, in fa|vour of this match: And once he &s;aid, He &s;hould by this means do as Victor Amadeus of Savoy did, rid him&s;elf of many incumbrances; and being not a <HI>king,</HI> was &s;ure of his &s;on's duty to him.</P>
<P>The Ladies found a Letter of their brother's among Sir Thomas's loo&s;e papers, which &s;hewed that this offer had been actually made him. This is a copy of it.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear and ever-honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a&s;toni&s;hed at the contents of your la&s;t favour. If the propo&s;al made in it, aro&s;e from the natural greatne&s;s of your mind, and an indulgence which I have &s;o often experienced, what &s;hall I &s;ay to it? I cannot bear it. If it proceed from propo&s;als made to you, God forbid that I &s;hould give your name to a woman, how illu&s;trious &s;oever in her de&s;cent, and how high &s;oever the circum&s;tances of her family, who&s;e friends could propo&s;e &s;uch conditions to my father.</P>
<P>I receive with inexpre&s;&s;ible joy &s;o near an hope of the long wi&s;hed-for leave to throw my&s;elf at your feet in my native country. When I have this hap|pine&s;s granted me, I will unbo&s;om my whole heart to my father. The credit of your name, and the knowledge every one has of your goodne&s;s to me, will be my recommendation whenever you &s;hall wi&s;h me to enlarge the family connexions.</P>
<P>Till I have this honour, I be&s;eech you, Sir, to di&s;|continue the treaty already begun.</P>
<P>You are plea&s;ed to a&s;k my opinion of the Lady, and whether I have any objection to her per&s;on. I re|member, I thought her a very agreeable woman.</P>
<P>You mention, Sir, the high &s;en&s;e the Lady, as well as Lord and Lady N. have of the civilities they received from me. My long re&s;idence abroad gave me the power of doing little offices for tho&s;e of my country, who vi&s;ited France and Italy. Tho&s;e &s;er|vices
<PB N="190" REF="191">
are too gratefully remember'd by my Lord and the Ladies.</P>
<P>I am extremely concern'd that you have rea&s;on to be di&s;plea&s;ed with any part of the conduct of my &s;i&s;ters. Can the daughters of &s;uch a mother as you had the happine&s;s to give them, forget them&s;elves? Their want of con&s;ideration &s;hall receive no counte|nance from me. I &s;hall let them know, that my Love, my e&s;teem, if it be of con&s;equence with them, is not founded on relation, but merit: And that, where duty to a parent is wanting, all other good qualities are to be &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>You a&s;k my opinion of my Lord L. and whether he has &s;ought to engage me to favour his addre&s;s to your Caroline. He wrote to me on that &s;ubject: I inclo&s;e his Letter, and a copy of my an&s;wer. As to my opi|nion of him, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I have not met with any Briti&s;h man abroad, of who&s;e di&s;cretion, &s;obriety, and good-nature, I think more highly than I do of Lord L.'s. Ju&s;tice requires of me this te&s;timony. But as to the affair between him and my &s;i&s;ter, I &s;hall be extremely &s;orry, if Lord L.'s <HI>fir&s;t</HI> impropriety of behaviour were to you; and if my &s;i&s;ter has &s;uffer'd her heart to be engaged again&s;t her duty.</P>
<P>You have the goodne&s;s to &s;ay, that my return will be a &s;trengthening of your hands: May my own be weaken'd; May I ever want the power to do good to my&s;elf, or to tho&s;e I love, when I forget, or depart from, the duty owing to the mo&s;t indulgent of fa|thers, by</P>

<P>The above Letter came not to the hands of the young Ladies till after their father's death, which happen'd within a month of his receiving it, and be|fore he had actually given permi&s;&s;ion for the young gentleman's return. You may &s;uppo&s;e they were ex|ce&s;&s;ively affected with the bad impre&s;&s;ions their father had &s;ought to make in their brother's heart, of their conduct; and when he died, were the more appre|hen&s;ive of their force.</P>
<P>He had &s;u&s;pended the treaty of marriage for his &s;on till the young gentleman &s;hould arrive. He had per|plexed him&s;elf about his private affairs, which, by long neglect, became very intricate, and of con&s;equence mu&s;t be very irk&s;ome for &s;uch a man to look into. He was re|&s;olved therefore to leave it to each &s;teward (having per|&s;uaded him&s;elf, again&s;t appearances, to have a good opinion of both) to examine the accounts of the other; not only as this would give the lea&s;t trouble to him&s;elf, but as they had &s;everal items to charge, which he had no mind &s;hould be explained to his &s;on. Nor were tho&s;e gentlemen le&s;s &s;olicitous to obtain di&s;charges from him; for being appri&s;ed of his rea&s;on for look|ing into his affairs, they were afraid of the in&s;pection of &s;o good a manager as their young ma&s;ter was known to be.</P>
<P>Mr. Filmer, the &s;teward for the Iri&s;h e&s;tate, came over, on this occa&s;ion, with his accounts: The two &s;tewards acted in concert; and on the report of each, Sir Thomas examined totals only, and order'd relea&s;es to be drawn for his &s;igning.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="193">
What a degrader even of <HI>high</HI> &s;pirits, is vice! What meanne&s;s was there in Sir Thomas's pride! To be afraid of the eye of a &s;on, of who&s;e duty he was always boa&s;ting!</P>
<P>But who &s;hall an&s;wer for the re&s;ormation of an habitual libertine, when a temptation offers? Ob|&s;erve what followed:</P>
<P>Mr. Filmer, knowing Sir Thomas's frailty, had brought over with him, and with a view to en&s;nare the unhappy man, a fine young creature, not more than &s;ixteen, on pretence of vi&s;iting her aunt who lived in Pallmall, and who was a relation of his wife. She was innocent of actual crime: But her parents had no virtue, and had not made it a part of the young woman's education; but had, on the contrar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, brought her up with a notion that her beauty would make her fortune; and &s;he knew it was all the for|tune they had to give her.</P>
<P>Mr. Filmer, in his attendances on Sir Thomas, was always prai&s;ing the beauty of Mi&s;s Obrian; her gen|teel de&s;cent, as well as figure, her innocence [Inno|cence! the Attractive equally to the attempts of Rakes and Devils!] But the Baronet, intent upon pur&s;uing his better &s;chemes, for &s;ome time, only gave the artful man the hearing. At la&s;t, however (for curio&s;ity|&s;ake) he was prevailed upon to make the aunt a vi&s;it. The niece was not ab&s;ent. She more than an&s;wered all that Filmer had &s;aid in her prai&s;e, as to the beauty of her per&s;on. Sir Thomas repeated his vi&s;its. The girl was well tutored; behaved with prudence, with re&s;erve rather; and, in &s;hort, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on his heart, that he declared to Filmer that he could not live without her.</P>
<P>Advantage was endeavoured to be taken of his in|&s;atuation. He offered high terms: But for &s;ome time the aunt in&s;i&s;ted upon his marrying her niece.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas had been too long a <HI>leader</HI> in the free world, to be &s;o <HI>taken-in,</HI> as it is called. But at la&s;t, a
<PB N="193" REF="194">
propo&s;al was made him, from no part of which, the aunt declared &s;he would recede, tho' the poor girl, (who, it was pretended, loved him above all the men &s;he had ever &s;een) were to break her heart for him. A fine piece of flattery, Lucy, to a man who num|bered near three times her years; and who was &s;till fond of making conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>The terms were: That he &s;hould &s;ettle upon the young woman 500 <HI>l.</HI> a year for her life; and on her father and mother, if they could be brought to con|&s;ent to the (infamous) bargain, 200 <HI>l.</HI> a year for their joint and &s;eparate lives: That Mi&s;s Obrien &s;hould live at one of Sir Thomas's &s;eats in England; be allowed genteel equipages, his livery; and even for her credit-&s;ake, in the eye of her own rela|tions, who were of figure, to be connived at in taking his name. The aunt left it to his genero&s;ity to reward her for the part &s;he had taken, and was to take, to bring all this about with the parents and girl.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas thought the&s;e demands much too high: He &s;tood out for &s;ome time; but artifice being u&s;ed on all &s;ides to draw him on, <HI>Love,</HI> as it is called (pro&s;ti|tuted word!) obliged him to comply.</P>
<P>His whole concern was now, how to provide for this new expence, without <HI>robbing,</HI> as he called it, his &s;on (daughters were but daughters, and no part of the que&s;tion with him); and to find excu&s;es for conti|nuing the young gentleman abroad,</P>
<P>Mrs. Oldham had, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, been unea&s;y her&s;elf, and made him &s;o, by her compunction on their guilty commerce; and now lately, on Sir Tho|mas's communicating his intention to recal his &s;on, had hinted her wi&s;hes to be allowed to quit the hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex, and to retire both from that and him; for fear of making the young gentleman as much her enemy, as the two &s;i&s;ters avowedly were.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="195">
Mrs. Oldham's propo&s;al, now that he was acquaint|ed with Mi&s;s Obrian, was better reli&s;hed by Sir Thomas, than when it was fir&s;t made. And before he actually &s;igned and &s;ealed with the aunt, for her niece, he thought it was be&s;t to &s;ound that unhappy woman, whether &s;he in earne&s;t de&s;ired to retire; and if &s;o, what were her expectations from him: Re|&s;olving, in order to provide for both expences, to cut down timber, that, he &s;aid, groaned for the ax; but which hitherto he had let &s;tand as a re&s;ource for his &s;on, and to enable him to clear incumbrances that he had him&s;elf laid upon a part of his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he &s;et out for his &s;eat in E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>THERE, while he was planning future &s;chemes of living, and reckoning upon his &s;avings in &s;e|veral articles, in order the better to &s;upport an ex|pence &s;o guiltily to be incurred; and had actually be|gun to treat with Mrs. Oldham; who agreed, at the fir&s;t word, to retire; not knowing but his motive, (poor man!) as well as hers, was reformation. There was he attacked by a violent fever; which in three days deprived him of the u&s;e of that rea&s;on which he had &s;o much abu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Bever, his Engli&s;h &s;teward, po&s;ted down, on the fir&s;t news he had of his being taken ill, hoping to get him to &s;ign the ready-drawn up relea&s;es. But the eagerne&s;s he &s;hewed to have this done, giving cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion to Mrs. Oldham, &s;he would not let him &s;ee his ma&s;ter, tho' he arrived on the &s;econd day of Sir Thomas's illne&s;s, which was before the fever had &s;eized his brain.</P>
<P>Mr. Filmer had been to meet, and conduct to Lon|don, Mrs. Obrian the mother of the girl, who came over to &s;ee the &s;ale of the poor victim's honour com|pleted [Could you have thought, Lucy, there was &s;uch a mother in the world?]; and it was not till the fifth day of the unhappy man's illne&s;s that he got to him, with his relea&s;es al&s;o ready drawn up, as well
<PB N="195" REF="196">
as the articles between him and the Obrians, in hopes to find him well enough to &s;ign both. He was in a vi&s;ible con&s;ternation when he found his ma&s;ter &s;o ill. He would have &s;taid in the hou&s;e to watch the event; but Mrs. Oldham not permitting him to do &s;o, he put up at the next village, in hopes of a favourable turn of the di&s;temper.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth day, the phy&s;icians giving no hopes of Sir Thomas's recovery, Mrs. Oldham &s;ent to acquaint the two young Ladies with his danger; and they in|&s;tantly &s;et out to attend their father.</P>
<P>They could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to love Mrs. Oldham; and, taking Mr. Grandi&s;on's advice, who accompa|nied them, they let the unhappy gentlewoman know, that there was no farther occa&s;ion for her attendance on their father. She had prudently, before, that &s;he might give the le&s;s offence to the two Ladies, removed her &s;on by her former hu&s;band, and her two children by Sir Thomas; but in&s;i&s;ted on continuing about him, and in the hou&s;e, as well from motives of ten|derne&s;s, as for her own &s;ecurity, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be charged with embezlements; for &s;he expected not mercy from the family, if Sir Thomas died.</P>
<P>Poor woman! what a tenure was that by which &s;he held!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Caroline con&s;ented, and brought her &s;i&s;ter to con&s;ent, that &s;he &s;hould &s;tay; ab&s;olutely again&s;t Mr. Grandi&s;on's advice; who, libertine as he was him|&s;elf, was very zealous to puni&s;h a poor Magdalen, who, <HI>tho'</HI> faulty, was not &s;o faulty as him&s;elf. Wick|ed people, I believe, my dear, are the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hers of tho&s;e wicked people, who admini&s;ter not to their own particular gratifications. Can mercy be expected from &s;uch? Mercy is a <HI>virtue.</HI></P>
<P>It was &s;hocking to the la&s;t degree to the worthy daughters to hear their raving father call upon nobody &s;o often, as upon Mi&s;s Obrian; tho' they then knew nothing of the girl, nor of the treaty on foot for her;
<PB N="196" REF="197">
nor could Mrs. Oldham inform them, who or what &s;he was. Sometimes, when the unhappy man was quiete&s;t, he would call upon his &s;on, in words gene|rally of kindne&s;s and Love. Once in particular, cry|ing out&mdash;O &s;ave me! &s;ave me! my Grandi&s;on, by thy pre&s;ence! I &s;hall be con&s;umed by the fire that is already lighted up in my boiling blood.</P>
<P>On the ninth day, no hope being left, and the phy&s;icians declaring him to be a dying man, they di|&s;patched a Letter by a me&s;&s;enger to ha&s;ten over their brother, who (having left his ward, Mi&s;s Emily Jer|vois, at Florence in the protection of the worthy Dr. Bartlett) was come to Paris, as he had written, in expectation of receiving there his father's permi&s;&s;ion to return to England.</P>
<P>On the eleventh day of his illne&s;s, Sir Thomas came a little to him&s;elf. He knew his daughters. He wept over them. He wi&s;h'd he had been kinder to them. He was &s;en&s;ible of his danger. Several times he lifted up his feeble hands, and dying eyes, repeat|ing, God is ju&s;t. I am, I have been, very wicked! Repentance! Repentance! how hard a ta&s;k! &s;aid he once to the mini&s;ter who attended him, and who&s;e prayers he de&s;ired.&mdash;And Mrs. Oldham once coming in his &s;ight&mdash;O Mrs. Oldham! &s;aid he, what is this world now? What wou'd I give&mdash;But repent, re|pent&mdash;Put your good re&s;olutions in practice, le&s;t I have more &s;ouls than my own to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>Soon after this his delirium return'd; and he ex|pired about eleven at night, in dreadful agonies. Unhappy man!&mdash;Join a tear with mine, my Lucy, on the awful exit of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on, tho' we knew him not.</P>
<P>Poor man! in the pur&s;uit&mdash;Poor man!&mdash;He lived not to &s;ee his beloved &s;on!&mdash;</P>
<P>The two daughters, and Mr. Grandi&s;on, and Mrs. Oldham (for her own &s;ecurity) put their re&s;pective &s;eals on every place, at that hou&s;e, where papers, or
<PB N="197" REF="198">
any-thing of value were &s;uppo&s;ed to be repo&s;ited: And Mr. Grandi&s;on, a&s;&s;uming that part of the ma|nagement; di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Mrs. Oldham from the hou&s;e; and would not permit her to take with her more than one &s;uit of cloaths, be&s;ides tho&s;e &s;he had on. She wept bitterly, and complained of har&s;h treat|ment: But was not pitied; and was referred by Mr. Grandi&s;on to his ab&s;ent cou&s;in for &s;till more rigorous ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>She appealed to the ladies; but they reproach'd her with having lived a life of &s;hame, again&s;t better knowledge; and &s;aid, That now &s;he mu&s;t take the con&s;equence. Her puni&s;hment was but beginning. Their brother would do her &s;trict ju&s;tice, they doubted not: But a man of his virtue, they were &s;ure, would abhor her. She had mi&s;-led their father, they &s;aid. It was not in his temper to be cruel to his children. She had lived upon their fortunes; and now they had nothing but their brother's favour to depend upon.</P>
<P>Daughters &s;o dutiful, my Lucy, did right to excu&s;e their father all they could: But Mrs. Oldham &s;uf|fer'd for all.</P>
<P>I AM &s;o much intere&s;ted in this important hi&s;tory&punc; that I have not the heart to break into it, to tell you how very agreeably I pa&s;s my time with the&s;e ladies, and Lord L. in tho&s;e parts of the day, when we are all a&s;&s;embled. Mi&s;s Emily has a fine mind; gentle, delicate, innocently childi&s;h beyond her &s;tature and womanly appearance; but not her years. The two Ladies are very good to her. Lord L. is an excellent man.</P>
<P>This is Friday morning: And no Sir Charles! <HI>Canterbury</HI> is &s;urely a charming place. Was you ever at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> Lucy?</P>
<P>To-morrow, Lady D. is to vi&s;it my aunt. My letter to my aunt will be in time, I hope. I long to

know&mdash;Yet why &s;hould I?&mdash;But Lady D. is &s;o <HI>good</HI> a woman! I hope &s;he will take kindly my denial, and look upon it as an ab&s;olute one.</P>
<P>I have a great deal more of the family-hi&s;tory to give you: I wi&s;h I could write as fa&s;t as we can talk. But, Lucy, concerning the Lady, with who&s;e father Sir Thomas was in treaty for his &s;on? Don't you want to know &s;omething more about her?&mdash;But, ah, my dear, be this as it may, there <HI>is</HI> a Lady, in who&s;e favour both &s;i&s;ters intere&s;t them&s;elves. I have found that out. Nor will it be long, I &s;uppo&s;e, before I &s;hall be in|formed who &s;he is; and whether or not Sir Charles encourages the propo&s;al.</P>
<P>Adieu, my Lucy! You will &s;oon have another Letter from</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="19" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER XIX. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>YOU &s;ee, my dear, how many important mat|ters depended on the conduct and determination of the young Baronet</P>
<P>Lord I was at this time in Scotland, where he had &s;een married two of his three &s;i&s;ters; and was bu&s;ying him&s;elf in putting his affairs in &s;uch a way, as &s;hould enable him to depend the le&s;s, either on the ju&s;tice or genero&s;ity of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on, who&s;e beloved daughter he was impatient to call his.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Charlotte was ab&s;olutely dependent upon her brother's genero&s;ity; and both &s;i&s;ters had rea&s;on to be the more unea&s;y, as it was now, in the worldly|wi&s;e way of thinking, become his <HI>intere&s;t</HI> to keep up the di&s;tance which their unhappy father had been &s;ol|licitous to create between them, from a policy low, and entirely unworthy of him.</P>
<P>The unhappy Mrs. Oldham had already received a &s;evere in&s;tance of the change of her fortune; and
<PB N="199" REF="200">
had no rea&s;on to doubt, but that the &s;i&s;ters, who had always, from the time &s;he was &s;et over them as their governe&s;s, look'd upon her with an evil eye; and afterwards had but too ju&s;t a pretence for their aver|&s;ion; would incen&s;e again&s;t her a brother, who&s;e fortune had been le&s;&s;en'd by his father's profu&s;ion. The few relations &s;he had living, were people of honour, who renounced all corre&s;pondence with her, from the time &s;he had thrown her&s;elf &s;o ab&s;olutely into the power of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on: And &s;he had three &s;ons to take care of.</P>
<P>Bever and Filmer, the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h &s;tewards, were attending Sir Charles's arrival with great impa|tience, in hopes he would &s;ign tho&s;e accounts of theirs; to which they had no rea&s;on to que&s;tion but his father would have &s;et his hand, had he not been taken &s;o &s;uddenly ill, and remained delirious almo&s;t to the end of his life.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Obrian, her mother and aunt, I &s;hall men|tion in another place.</P>
<P>Lord W. had a great di&s;like to his nephew, for no other rea&s;on, as I have &s;aid, than becau&s;e he was his father's favourite. Yet were not his nieces likely to find their uncle more their friend for that. He was indeed almo&s;t entirely under the management of a woman, who had not either the birth, the education, the &s;en&s;e, or moderation of Mrs. Oldham, to put in the con|trary &s;cale again&s;t her lo&s;t virtue; but abounded, it &s;eems, in a low &s;elfi&s;h cunning, by which &s;he never failed to carry every point &s;he &s;et her heart upon: For, as is u&s;ual, they &s;ay, with the&s;e keeping men, Lord W. would yield up, to avoid her teazing, what he would not have done to a wife of fortune and family, who might have been a credit to his own: But the <HI>real &s;lave,</HI> imagined him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his <HI>liberty;</HI> and &s;at down &s;atisfied with the &s;ound of word.</P>
<P>The &s;u&s;pended treaty of marriage with Lord N.'s &s;i&s;ter was al&s;o to be taken into con&s;ideration, either
<PB N="200" REF="201">
to be proceeded with, or broken off, as &s;hould be concluded by both parties.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ituation of affairs in the family, when Sir Charles arrived.</P>
<P>He return'd not an an&s;wer to his &s;i&s;ter's notification of his father's danger; but immediately &s;et out for Calais, and the &s;ame day arrived at the hou&s;e of his late father in St. James's Square. His &s;i&s;ters con|cluded, that he would be in town nearly as &s;oon as a Letter could come. They therefore every hour, for two days together, expected him.</P>
<P>Judge, my dear, from the foregoing circum&s;tances (&s;i&s;terly Love out of the que&s;tion, which yet it could not be) how awful mu&s;t be to them, after eight or nine years ab&s;ence, the fir&s;t appearance of a brother, on whom the whole of their fortunes depended; and to whom they had been accu&s;ed by a father, now &s;o lately departed, of want of duty; their brother's duty unque&s;tionable!</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;ame</HI> moment he alighted from his po&s;t|chai&s;e, the door was open'd; he enter'd; and his two &s;i&s;ters met him, in the hall.</P>
<P>The graceful youth of &s;eventeen, with fine curling auburn locks waving upon his &s;houlders; delicate in complexion; intelligence &s;parkling in his fine free eyes; and good humour &s;weetening his lively features; they remembred: And, forgetting the womanly beau|ties into which their own features were ripen'd in the &s;ame &s;pace of time, they &s;eemed not to expect that manly &s;tature and air, and that equal vivacity and in|trepidity, which every one who &s;ees this brother, ad|mires in his noble a&s;pect: An a&s;pect then appearing more &s;olemn than u&s;ual; an unburied and beloved father in his thoughts.</P>
<P>O my brother! &s;aid Caroline, with open arms: But, &s;hrinking from his embrace; <HI>May</HI> I &s;ay, my brother?&mdash;and was ju&s;t fainting. He cla&s;ped her in his arms, to &s;upport her&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="202">
Charlotte, &s;urpri&s;ed at her &s;i&s;ter's emotion, and af|fected with his pre&s;ence, ran back into the room they had both quitted, and threw her&s;elf upon a &s;ettee.</P>
<P>Her brother followed her into the room, his arm round Mi&s;s Caroline's wai&s;t, &s;oothing her; and, with eyes of expectation, my Charlotte! &s;aid he, his in|viting hand held out, and ha&s;tening towards the &s;ettee. She then found her feet; and, throwing her arms about his neck, he folded both &s;i&s;ters to his bo&s;om: Receive, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ters, receive your bro|ther, your friend; a&s;&s;ure your&s;elves of my unabated Love.</P>
<P>That a&s;&s;urance, they &s;aid, was balm to their hearts; and when each was &s;eated, he, &s;itting over again&s;t them, look'd fir&s;t on one, then on the other; and taking each by the hand; Charming women! &s;aid he: How I admire my &s;i&s;ters! You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> have minds an&s;werable to your per&s;ons. What plea&s;ure, what pride, &s;hall I take in my &s;i&s;ters!</P>
<P>My dear Charlotte! &s;aid Mi&s;s Caroline, taking her &s;i&s;ter's other hand, has not our brother, now we &s;ee him near, all the brother in his a&s;pect? His goodne&s;s only looks &s;tronger, and more perfect: What was I afraid of?</P>
<P><HI>My</HI> heart al&s;o &s;unk, &s;aid Charlotte; I know not why. But we feared&mdash;Indeed, Sir, we both feared&mdash;O my brother!&mdash;Tears trickling down the cheeks of each&mdash;we meant not to be <HI>undutiful</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Love your brother, my &s;i&s;ters, as he will endeavour to de&s;erve your Love. My mother's daughters could not be undutiful! Mi&s;take only! Unhappy mi&s;ap|prehen&s;ion! We have all &s;omething&mdash;Shades as well as lights there mu&s;t be!&mdash;A kind, a dutiful veil&mdash;</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed the hand of each with his lips, aro&s;e, went to the window, and drew out his handkerchief.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t he have in his thoughts! No doubt, but his father's unhappy turn, and recent departure! No wonder, that &s;uch a &s;on could not, without pious
<PB N="202" REF="203">
emotion, bear the reflexions that mu&s;t croud into his mind, at that in&s;tant!</P>
<P>Then, turning towards them, permit me, my dear &s;i&s;ters, &s;aid he, to retire for a few moments. He turn'd his face from them. My father, &s;aid he, demands this tribute. I will not a&s;k <HI>your</HI> excu&s;e, my &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>They joined in the payment of it; and waited on him to his apartment, with &s;ilent re&s;pect. No cere|mony, I hope, my Caroline, my Charlotte. We were true &s;i&s;ters and brother a few years ago. See your Charles as you &s;aw him then. Let not ab&s;ence which has increa&s;ed my Love, le&s;&s;en yours.</P>
<P>Each &s;i&s;ter took a hand, and would have ki&s;&s;ed it. He cla&s;ped his arms about them both, and &s;aluted them.</P>
<P>He ca&s;t his eye on his father's and mother's pic|tures with &s;ome emotion, then on them; and again &s;aluted each.</P>
<P>They withdrew. He waited on them to the &s;tair|head. Sweet obligingne&s;s! Amiable &s;i&s;ters! In a quarter of an hour I &s;eek your pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Tears of joy trickled down their cheeks. In half an hour he joined them in another dre&s;s, and re-&s;a|luted his &s;i&s;ters, with an air of tenderne&s;s, that bani&s;hed fear, and left room for nothing but &s;i&s;terly love.</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on came in &s;oon after. That gentle|man: who (as I believe I once before mentioned), had affected, in &s;upport of his own free way of life, to talk how he would laugh at his cou&s;in Charles, when he came to England, on his <HI>pious</HI> turn, as he called it; and even to boa&s;t, that he would enter him into the town-diver&s;ions, and make a <HI>man</HI> of him; was &s;truck with the dignity of his per&s;on, and yet charmed with the freedom of his behaviour. Good God! &s;aid he to the Ladies afterwards, what a fine young man is your brother!&mdash;What a &s;elf-denier was your father!&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="204">
The Ladies retiring, Mr. Grandi&s;on enter'd upon the circum&s;tances of Sir Thomas's illne&s;s and death; which, he told the &s;i&s;ters, he touch'd <HI>tenderly:</HI> As ten|derly, I &s;uppo&s;e, as a man of his unfeeling heart could touch &s;uch a &s;ubject. He inveighed again&s;t Mrs. Oldham; and with &s;ome exultation over her, told his cou&s;in what they had done as to her; and exclaim'd again&s;t her for the &s;tate &s;he had lived in; and the difficulty &s;he made to re&s;ign Sir Thomas to his daugh|ters care in his illne&s;s; and particularly for pre&s;uming to in&s;i&s;t upon putting her &s;eal with theirs to the cabi|nets and clo&s;ets, where they &s;uppo&s;ed were any va|luables.</P>
<P>Sir Charles heard all this without &s;aying one word, either of approbation or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Are you not plea&s;ed with what we have done, as to this vile woman, Sir Charles?</P>
<P>I have no doubt, cou&s;in, replied Sir Charles, that every thing was de&s;ign'd for the be&s;t.</P>
<P>And then Mr. Grandi&s;on, as he told the &s;i&s;ters, ridiculed the unhappy woman on her grief, and mor|tified behaviour, when &s;he was obliged to quit the hou&s;e, where, he &s;aid, &s;he had reigned &s;o long Lady Paramount.</P>
<P>Sir Charles a&s;k'd, If they had &s;earch'd for or found a will?</P>
<P>Mr. Grandi&s;on &s;aid. They had look'd in every probable place; but found none.</P>
<P>What I think to do, cou&s;in, &s;aid Sir Charles, is, to interr the venerable remains (I mu&s;t always &s;peak in this dialect, Sir) with tho&s;e of my mother. This I know, was his de&s;ire. I will have an elegant, but not &s;umptuous monument erected to the memory of both, with a mode&s;t in&s;cription, that &s;hall rather be matter of in&s;truction to the living, than a panegyric on the departed. The funeral &s;hall be decent, but not o&s;tentatious. The difference in the expence &s;hall be privately applied to relieve or a&s;&s;i&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="204" REF="205">
hou&s;ekeepers, or &s;ome of my fathers poor tenants, who have large families, and have not been wanting in their hone&s;t endeavours to maintain them. My &s;i&s;ters, I hope, will not think them&s;elves neglected, if I &s;pare them the pain of conferring with them on a &s;ubject that mu&s;t afflict them.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;entiments were new to Mr. Grandi&s;on. He told the &s;i&s;ters what Sir Charles had &s;aid. I did not contradict him, &s;aid he: But as Sir Thomas had &s;o magnificent a mind, and always lived up to it, I &s;hould have thought he ought to have been honoured with a magnificent funeral. But I cannot but own, however, that what your brother &s;aid, had &s;omething great and noble in it.</P>
<P>The two Ladies, on their brother's hinting his in|tentions to them, acquie&s;ced with all he propo&s;ed; and all was performed according to directions which he him&s;elf wrote down. He allowed of his &s;i&s;ters compliance with the fa&s;hion: But he in per&s;on &s;aw performed, with equal piety and decorum, the la&s;t offices.</P>
<P>Sir Charles is noted for his great dexterity in bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Were I to expre&s;s my&s;elf in the language of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, I &s;hould &s;ay, that a &s;un-beam is not more penetrating. He goes to the bottom of an af|fair at once, and wants but to hear both &s;ides of a que&s;tion to determine; and when he determines, his execution can only be &s;taid by perver&s;e accidents, that lie out of the reach of human fore&s;ight: And when he finds <HI>that</HI> to be the ca&s;e, yet the thing right to be done, he changes his methods of proceeding; as a man would do, who finding him&s;elf unable to pur&s;ue his journey by one road, becau&s;e of a &s;udden inundation, takes another, which, tho'a little about, carries him home in &s;afety.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;olemnity was over, Sir Charles, leaving every thing at Grandi&s;or-hall as he found it, and the &s;eals unbroken, came to town, and, in the
<PB N="205" REF="206">
pre&s;ence of his &s;i&s;ters, broke the &s;eals that had been affixed to the cabinets and e&s;crutoires in the hou&s;e there.</P>
<P>The Ladies told him, that their bills were ready for his in&s;pection; and that they had a balance in their hands. His an&s;wer was, I hope my dear &s;i&s;ters, we &s;hall have but one intere&s;t. It is for you to make the demands upon me, and for me to an&s;wer them as I &s;hall be able.</P>
<P>He made memorandums of the contents of many papers, with &s;urpri&s;ing expedition; and then locked them up. He found a bank note of 350<HI>l.</HI> in the private drawer of one of the bureaus in the apartment that was his father's. Be plea&s;ed, my &s;i&s;ters, &s;aid he, pre&s;enting it to Mi&s;s Caroline, to add that to the mo|ney in your hands, to an&s;wer family calls.</P>
<P>He then went with his &s;i&s;ters to the hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex. When there, he told them, it was nece&s;&s;ary for Mrs. Oldham (who had lodgings at a neighbouring farm|hou&s;e) to be pre&s;ent at the breaking of the &s;eals, as &s;he had hers affixed; and accordingly &s;ent for her.</P>
<P>They de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed &s;eeing her.</P>
<P>It will be a concern to me, &s;aid he, to &s;ee her: But what <HI>ought</HI> to be done, <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be done.</P>
<P>The poor woman came with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>You will not Lucy, be di&s;plea&s;ed with an account of what pa&s;&s;ed on the occa&s;ion. I was very attentive to it, as given by Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, who&s;e memory was aided by the recollection of her &s;i&s;ter. And, as I am u&s;ed to aim at giving affecting &s;cenes in the very words of the per&s;ons, as near as I can, to make them appear lively and natural, you will expect, that I &s;hould attempt to do &s;o in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, not expecting Mrs Oldham would be there &s;o &s;oon, was in his &s;tud with his groom and coachman, looking upon his hor&s;es: For there were mo&s;t of the hunters and racers, &s;ome of the fine&s;t bea&s;ts in the kingdom,</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="207">
By mi&s;take of Mi&s;s Caroline's maid, the poor wo|man was &s;hewn into the room where the two Ladies were. She was in great confu&s;ion; courte&s;ied; wept; and &s;tood, as well as &s;he could &s;tand; but leaned again&s;t the tape&s;try-hung wall.</P>
<P>How came this? &s;aid Mi&s;s Caroline to her maid. <HI>She</HI> was not to be &s;hewn in to us.</P>
<P>I beg pardon; courte&s;ying, and was for withdraw|ing; but &s;topt on Charlotte's &s;peech to her&mdash;My <HI>bro|ther</HI> &s;ent for you madam&mdash;Not <HI>we,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you&mdash;He &s;ays it is nece&s;&s;ary, as you thought fit to put your &s;eal with ours to the locked-up places, that you &s;hould be pre&s;ent at the breaking them. Yet he will &s;ee you with as much pain as you give us. Prepare your&s;elf to &s;ee him. You &s;eem mighty unfit&mdash;No wonder!</P>
<P>You have heard Lucy, that Charlotte attributes a great deal of alteration for the better in her temper, and even in her heart, to the example of her brother.</P>
<P>Indeed, I am unfit, <HI>very</HI> unfit, &s;aid the poor wo|man. Let me, Ladies, be&s;peak your genero&s;ity: A little of your pity: A little of your countenance. I am, indeed, an unhappy woman!</P>
<P>And &s;o you de&s;erve to be.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure we are the &s;ufferers, &s;aid Caroline.</P>
<P>Lord L. as &s;he owned, was then in her head, as well as heart.</P>
<P>If I may withdraw without &s;eeing Sir Charles I &s;hould take it for a favour. I find I cannot bear to &s;ee him. I in&s;i&s;t not upon being pre&s;ent at the breaking the &s;eals. I throw my&s;elf upon your mercy, Ladies, and upon his.</P>
<P>Cruel girls! &s;hall I call them, Lucy? I think I will&mdash;<HI>Cruel</HI> girls! They a&s;k'd her not to &s;it down, tho' they &s;aw the terror &s;he was in: And that &s;he had the mode&s;ty to forbear &s;itting in their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>What an humbling thing is the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having lived faultily, when calamity &s;eizes upon the
<PB N="207" REF="208">
heart!&mdash;But &s;hall not virtue be appea&s;ed, when the hand of God is acknowledged in the words, counte|nance, and behaviour, of the offender? Yet, per|haps, it is hard for &s;ufferers&mdash;Let me con&s;ider&mdash;Have I, from my heart, forgiven Sir Hargrave Pol|vexfen? I will examine into that another time.</P>
<P>And &s;o you have put your&s;elf into mourning, ma|dam?</P>
<P>Shall I &s;ay, that Caroline &s;aid this, and what follows? Yet I am glad it was not Charlotte, methinks; for Caroline thought her&s;elf a &s;ufferer by her, in an e&s;pe|cial manner&mdash;However, I am &s;orry it was either.</P>
<P>Pretty <HI>deep</HI> too! Your weeds, I &s;uppo&s;e, are at your lodgings&mdash;</P>
<P>You have been told, Lucy, that Mrs. Oldham by many was called Lady Grandi&s;on&punc; and that her birth, her education, good &s;en&s;e, tho' all was not &s;ufficient to &s;upport her virtue again&s;t nece&s;&s;ity and temptation (poor woman!) might have given her a claim to the title.</P>
<P>Indeed, Ladies, I am a <HI>real</HI> mourner&punc; But I never my&s;elf a&s;&s;umed a character, to which it was never in my thought to &s;olicit a right.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>madam,</HI> the world does you inju&s;tice, <HI>ma|dam,</HI> &s;aid Charlotte.</P>
<P>Here, Ladies are the keys of the &s;tores; of the confectionary; of the wine-vaults: You demanded them not, when you di&s;mi&s;&s;ed me from this hou&s;e. I thought to &s;end them&punc; But by the time I could pro|vide my&s;elf with a lodging, you were gone; and left only two common &s;ervants, be&s;ides the groom and helpers: And I thought it was be&s;t to keep the keys, till I could deliver them to your order, or Sir Char|les's. I have not been a bad manager, Ladies, con|&s;ider'd as an hou&s;ekeeper. All I have in the world is under the &s;eals. I am at yours and your brother's mercy.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters order'd their woman to take the keys,
<PB N="208" REF="209">
and bring them to the foot of their thrones. Dear Ladies, forgive me, if you &s;hould, by &s;urprize, &s;ee this. I know that you think and act in a different manner now.</P>
<P>Here comes my brother! &s;aid Caroline.</P>
<P>You'll &s;oon know, Madam, what you have to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to from <HI>him,</HI> &s;aid Charlotte.</P>
<P>The poor woman trembled, and turned pale. O how her heart mu&s;t throb, I warrant!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In continuation.</HEAD>
<P>SIR Charles enter'd. She was near the door. His &s;i&s;ters were at the other end of the room.</P>
<P>He bowed to her&mdash;Mrs. Oldham, I pre&s;ume, &s;aid he&mdash;Pray, Madam, be &s;eated. I &s;ent to you, that you might &s;ee the &s;eals&mdash;Pray, Madam, &s;it down.</P>
<P>He took her hand, and led her to a chair not far di&s;tant from them; and &s;at down in one between them and her.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ters owned, they were &s;tartled at his com|plai&s;ance to her. Dear Ladies! they forgot, at that moment, that <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> are &s;i&s;ter-graces, and cannot be &s;eparated in a virtuous bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Pray, madam, compo&s;e your &s;elf; looking upon her with eyes of angui&s;h and pity mingled, as the Ladies &s;aid, they afterwards recollected with more ap|probation than at the time. What, my Lucy, mu&s;t be the reflexions of this humane man, re&s;pecting his father, and her, at that moment!</P>
<P>He turn'd to his &s;i&s;ters, as if to give Mrs. Oldham time to recover her&s;elf. A flood of tears relieved her. She tried to &s;uppre&s;s her audible &s;obs, and, mo&s;t con|&s;iderately, he would not hear them. Her emotions attracting the eyes of the Ladies, he took them off, by a&s;king them &s;omething about a picture that hung on the other &s;ide of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="210">
He then drew his chair nearer to her, and again taking her trembling hand&mdash;I am not a &s;tranger to your melancholy &s;tory, Mrs. Oldham&mdash;Be not di&s;|compo&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topt to give her a few moments time to reco|ver her&s;elf&mdash;Re&s;uming; See in me a friend, ready to thank you for all your pa&s;t good offices, and to for|get all mi&s;taken ones.</P>
<P>She could not bear this. She threw her&s;elf at his feet. He rai&s;ed her to her chair.</P>
<P>Poor Mr. Oldham, &s;aid he, was unhappily carele&s;s! Yet I have been told he loved you, and that you me|rited his Love&mdash;Your misfortunes threw you into the knowledge of our family. You have been a faithful manager of the affairs of this hou&s;e&mdash;By written evi|dences I can ju&s;tify you; evidences that no one here will, I am &s;ure, di&s;pute.</P>
<P>It was plain, that his father had written in her prai&s;e, as an oeconomi&s;t; the only light in which this pious &s;on was then willing to con&s;ider her.</P>
<P>Indeed, I have&mdash;And I would &s;till have been&mdash;</P>
<P>No more of that, madam. Mr. Grandi&s;on, who is a good-natured man, but a little ha&s;ty, has told me that he treated you with unkindne&s;s. He owns you were patient under it. Patience never yet was a &s;oli|tary virtue. He thought you wrong for in&s;i&s;ting to put your &s;eal: But he was mi&s;taken. You did right, as to the thing; and I dare &s;ay, a woman of your prudence did not wrong in the manner. No one can judge of another, that cannot be that very other in imagination, when he takes the judgment-&s;eat.</P>
<P>O my brother! O my brother!&mdash;&s;aid both Ladies at one time&mdash;half in admiration, tho' half-concern'd, at a goodne&s;s &s;o eclip&s;ing.</P>
<P>Bear with me my &s;i&s;ters. We have <HI>all</HI> &s;omething to be forgiven for.</P>
<P>They knew not how far they were concern'd, in his opinion, in the admonition, from what their
<PB N="210" REF="211">
father had written of <HI>them.</HI> They owned, that they were mortified: Yet knew not how to be angry with a brother, who, tho' more than an equal &s;ufferer with them, could pre&s;erve <HI>his</HI> charity.</P>
<P>He then made a motion, dinner-time, as he &s;aid, not being near, for chocolate; and referred to Mrs. Oldham to direct it, as knowing be&s;t where every|thing was. She referred to the deliver'd-up keys. Caroline called in her &s;ervant, and gave them to her. Sir Charles de&s;ired Mrs. Oldham to be &s;o good as to direct the maid.</P>
<P>The Ladies ea&s;ily &s;aw, that he intended by this, to relieve the poor woman by &s;ome little employment; and to take the opportunity of her ab&s;ence, to en|deavour to reconcile them to his intentions, as well as manner of behaving to her.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he was gone out of the room, he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the Ladies:</P>
<P>My dear &s;i&s;ters, let me beg of you to think fa|vourably of me on this occa&s;ion. I would not di&s;|oblige you for the world. I con&s;ider not the ca&s;e of this poor woman, on the foot of her own merits, with regard to us. Our father's memory, is concern'd. Was <HI>he</HI> accountable to us, was <HI>&s;he,</HI> for what each did?&mdash;Neither of them was. She is intitled to ju&s;tice, for its own &s;ake: To genero&s;ity for ours: To kindne&s;s, for my father's. Mr. Grandi&s;on accu&s;ed her of living in too much &s;tate, as he called it. Can that be &s;aid to be <HI>her</HI> fault? With regard to <HI>us,</HI> was it <HI>any-body</HI>'s? My father's magnificent &s;pirit is well known. He was often at this hou&s;e. Where-ever he was, he lived in the &s;ame ta&s;te. He prai&s;es to me Mrs. Oldham's oeconomy in &s;everal of his Letters. He had a right to do what he would with his own fortune. It was not <HI>ours</HI> till now. Whatever he <HI>has</HI> left us, he might have &s;till le&s;&s;en'd it. That oeconomy is all that con|cerns us in intere&s;t; and that is in her favour. If any act of kindne&s;s to my &s;i&s;ters was wanting from
<PB N="211" REF="212">
the parent, they will rejoice, that they <HI>de&s;erved</HI> what they hoped to meet with from him: And where the parent had an option, they will be glad, that they acquie&s;ced under it. He could have given Mrs. Old|ham a title to a name that would have commanded our re&s;pect, if not our reverence. My &s;i&s;ters have enlarged minds: They are daughters of the mo&s;t charitable, the mo&s;t forgiving, of women. Mr. Grandi&s;on (it could not be <HI>you)</HI> has carried too &s;evere an hand towards her. Yet he meant &s;ervice to us all. I was willing, before I commended this poor woman to your <HI>mercy</HI> (&s;ince it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ee her) to judge of her behaviour. Is &s;he not humbled enough? From my &s;oul I pity her. She loved my father; and I have no doubt but mourns for him in &s;ecret; yet dares not own, dares not plead, her love. I am wil|ling to con&s;ider her only as one who has executed a principal office in this hou&s;e: It becomes us &s;o to behave to her, as that the world &s;hould think, we con|&s;ider her in that light only. As to the <HI>living proofs</HI> (unhappy innocents!) I am concern'd, that what are the delight of other parents, are the di&s;grace of this. But let <HI>us</HI> not, by re&s;entments, publi&s;h faults that could not be <HI>hers only</HI>&mdash;Need I &s;ay more?&mdash;It would pain me to be obliged to it. With pain have I &s;aid thus much&mdash;The circum&s;tances of the cafe are &s;uch, that I cannot give it its full force. I a&s;k it of you as a favour, not as a right (I &s;hould hate my&s;elf, were I capable of exerting to the utmo&s;t any power that may be devolved upon me) that you will be &s;o good as to leave the conduct of this affair to me. You will greatly oblige me, if you can give me your chearful acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P>They an&s;wer'd by tears. They could not &s;peak.</P>
<P>By this time Mrs. Oldham returned; and, in an humble manner, offer'd chocolate to each young lady. They bent their necks, not their bodies, with cold ci|vility, as they owned; each extending her &s;tately hand,
<PB N="212" REF="213">
as if &s;he knew not whether &s;he &s;hould put it out or not.</P>
<P>Methinks I &s;ee them. How could &s;uch gracious girls be &s;o ungracious, after what Sir Charles had &s;aid?</P>
<P>Their brother, they &s;aw, &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed. He took the &s;alver from Mrs. Oldham. Pray, madam, &s;it down, &s;aid he, offering her a di&s;h, which &s;he de|clined, and held the toa&s;ted bread to his &s;i&s;ters; who then were ready enough to take each &s;ome&mdash;And when they had drank their chocolate; Now, Mrs. Oldham, &s;aid he, I will attend you&mdash;Si&s;ters, you will give me your company.</P>
<P>They aro&s;e to follow him. The poor woman courte&s;ied, I warrant, and &s;tood by while they pa&s;&s;ed: And methinks I &s;ee the dear girls bridle, and walk as &s;tately and as upright, as dutche&s;&s;es may be &s;uppo&s;ed to do in a coronation-proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on acknowledged, that &s;he grudged her brother's extraordinary complai&s;ance to Mrs. Old|ham; and &s;aid to her &s;i&s;ter, as arm in arm they went out, Politene&s;s is a charming thing, Caroline!</P>
<P>I don't quite under&s;tand it, replied the other.</P>
<P>They did not intend their brother &s;hould hear what they &s;aid: But he did; and turned back to them (Mrs. Oldham being at a di&s;tance, and on his &s;peak|ing low, dropping &s;till further behind them): Don't you, my &s;i&s;ters, do too little, and I will not do too much. She is a gentlewoman. She is unhappy from <HI>within.</HI> Thank God, <HI>you</HI> are not. And &s;he is not now, nor ever was, your &s;ervant.</P>
<P>They reddened, and looked upon each other in &s;ome confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>He pre&s;&s;ed each of their hands, as in Love. Don't let me give you concern, &s;aid he; only permit me to remind you, while it is yet in time, that you have an opportunity given you to &s;hew your&s;elves Gran|di&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="214">
When they came to the chamber in which Sir Tho|mas died, and which was his u&s;ual apartment, Mrs. Oldham turned pale, and begged to be excu&s;ed at|tending them in it. She wept. You will find every|thing there, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, to be as it ought. I am ready to an&s;wer all que&s;tions. Permit me to wait in the adjoining drawing-room.</P>
<P>Sir Charles allow'd her reque&s;t.</P>
<P>Poor woman! &s;aid he: How unhappily circum|&s;tanced is &s;he, that &s;he dares not, in <HI>this</HI> company, &s;hew the tenderne&s;s, which is the glory, not only of the female, but of the human nature!</P>
<P>In one of the cabinets in that chamber they found a beautiful little ca&s;ket, and a paper wafer'd upon the back of it; with the&s;e words written in Sir Thomas's hand, <HI>My wife's jewels,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The key was tied to one of the &s;ilver handles.</P>
<P>Had you not my mother's jewels divided between you? a&s;k'd he.</P>
<P>My father once &s;hew'd us this ca&s;ket at Grandi&s;on|hall, an&s;wer'd Caroline. We thought it was &s;till there.</P>
<P>My dear &s;i&s;ters, let me a&s;k you: Did my father forbear pre&s;enting the&s;e to you, from any declared <HI>mi&s;apprehen&s;ion</HI> of your want of duty to him?</P>
<P>No, replied Mi&s;s Caroline. But he told us, they &s;hould be ours when we married. You have heard, I dare &s;ay, that he was not fond of &s;eeing us dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t have been <HI>mi&s;apprehen&s;ion</HI> only, had it been &s;o. You could not be undutiful to a <HI>father.</HI></P>
<P>He would not permit it to be open'd before him: But, pre&s;enting it to them, Receive your right, my &s;i&s;ters. It is heavy. I hope there is more than jewels in it. I know that my mother u&s;ed to depo&s;it in it her little hoard. I am &s;ure there can be no di&s;pute between &s;uch affectionate &s;i&s;ters, on the partition of the contents of this ca&s;ket.</P>

<P>WHEN Sir Charles and his &s;i&s;ters had look'd over every other place in his father's apartment, they followed Mrs. Oldham to hers.</P>
<P>A very hand&s;ome apartment upon my word!</P>
<P>How <HI>could</HI> Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on&mdash;She knew the &s;ituation the unhappy woman had been in: Mi&s;tre&s;s of that hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Her brother look'd at her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Oldham &s;hewed them which of the furniture and pictures (&s;ome of the latter valuable ones) &s;he had brought into the hou&s;e, &s;aved, as &s;he &s;aid, from the wreck of her hu&s;band's fortune&mdash;But, &s;aid &s;he, with the con&s;ent of creditors. I, for <HI>my part,</HI> did not wrong any-body.</P>
<P>In that clo&s;et, Sir, continued &s;he, pointing to it, is all that I account my&s;elf worth in the world. Mr. Grandi&s;on was plea&s;ed to put his &s;eal upon the door. I be&s;ought him to let me take 50<HI>l.</HI> out of it; having but very little money about me: But he would not: His refu&s;al, be&s;ides the di&s;grace, has put me to &s;ome &s;hifts. But, weeping, I throw my&s;elf upon your mercy, Sir.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters frankly owned, that they harden'd each other by fault-finding. They whi&s;per'd, that &s;he ex|pected no mercy from <HI>them,</HI> it was plain. O what a glory belongs to goodne&s;s, as well in its influences, as in it&s;elf! Not even the&s;e two amiable &s;i&s;ters, as Mi&s;s Charlotte once acknowleged, were &s;o noble in them|&s;elves before their brother's arrival, as they are now.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf of ju&s;tice, madam, &s;aid Sir Charles. Mr. Grandi&s;on is ha&s;ty: But he would have done you ju&s;tice, I dare &s;ay. He thought he was acting for a tru&s;t.&mdash;You may have letters, you may have things,
<PB N="217" REF="218">
here in this clo&s;et, that we have no bu&s;ine&s;s with&mdash;Then, breaking the &s;eal; I leave it to you, to &s;hew us any-thing proper for us to take account of. The re&s;t I wi&s;h not to &s;ee.</P>
<P>My Ladies, Sir&mdash;They will be plea&s;ed to&mdash;</P>
<P>YES, Mrs. Oldham, &s;aid Caroline: And was put|ting her&s;elf before her brother, and &s;o was her &s;i&s;ter, while Sir Charles was withdrawing from the clo&s;et: But he took each by her hand, interrupting Caroline&mdash;</P>
<P>No, <HI>Mrs. Oldham</HI>&mdash;Do you lay out things as you plea&s;e: We will &s;tep into the next apartment.</P>
<P>He accordingly led them both out.</P>
<P>You are very generous, Sir, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>I <HI>would</HI> be &s;o, Charlotte. Ought not the private drawers of women to be &s;acred?</P>
<P>But &s;uch a creature, Sir&mdash;&s;aid Mi&s;s Caroline&mdash;</P>
<P>Every creature is intitled to ju&s;tice&mdash;Can Ladies forget decorum? You &s;ee &s;he was &s;urpri&s;ed by Mr. Grandi&s;on. She has &s;uffer'd di&s;grace: Has been put to &s;hifts.</P>
<P>Well, Sir, if &s;he will do ju&s;tice&mdash;</P>
<P>Remember (with looks of meaning) who&s;e <HI>hou&s;e|keeper</HI> &s;he was.</P>
<P>They owned they were daunted [And &s;o, dear La|dies, you ought to have been] but not convinced at that in&s;tant. It is generous to own this; becau&s;e the acknowledgment makes not for your glory, Ladies.</P>
<P>Mrs. Oldham, with tears in her eyes, came cour|te&s;ying to the Ladies and their brother, offering to conduct them into her clo&s;et. They found, that &s;he had &s;pread on her table in it, and in the two win|dows, and in the chairs, letters, papers, laces, fine linen, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e papers, Sir, &s;aid &s;he, belong to you. I was <HI>bid</HI> to keep them &s;afe [Poor woman! &s;he knew not how to &s;ay, <HI>by whom</HI> bid.] You will &s;ee, Sir, the &s;eals are whole.</P>
<P>Perhaps a <HI>will;</HI> &s;aid he.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="219">
No, Sir, I believe not. I was told they belonged to the Iri&s;h e&s;tate. Alas! and &s;he wiped her eyes, I have rea&s;on to think, there was not time for a will&mdash;</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, Mrs. Oldham, you urged for a will&mdash;&s;aid Mi&s;s Charlotte.</P>
<P>Indeed, Ladies, I often did; I own it.</P>
<P>I don't doubt it, &s;aid Mi&s;s Caroline.</P>
<P>And very <HI>prudently,</HI> &s;aid Sir Charles. I my&s;elf have always had a will by me. I &s;hould think it a kind of <HI>pre&s;umption</HI> to be a week without one.</P>
<P>In this drawer, Sir, are the money and notes, and &s;ecurities, that I have been getting together. I do a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, very hone&s;tly&mdash;pulling out a draw|er in the cabinet.</P>
<P>To what amount, Mrs. Oldham, if I may be <HI>&s;o bold?</HI> a&s;k'd Caroline.</P>
<P>No matter, &s;i&s;ter Caroline, to what amount, &s;aid Sir Charles. You hear Mrs. Oldham &s;ay, they are hone&s;tly got together. I dare &s;ay, that my father's bounty enabled even his meane&s;t <HI>&s;ervants</HI> to &s;ave mo|ney. I would not keep one, that I thought did not. I make no compari&s;ons, Mrs. Oldham: You are a gentlewoman.</P>
<P>The two Ladies only whi&s;per'd to each other, as they owned, <HI>So we think!</HI>&mdash;Were there ever &s;uch perver&s;e girls? I am afraid my uncle will think him|&s;elf ju&s;tified by them on this occa&s;ion, when he a&s;&s;erts, that it is one of the mo&s;t difficult things in the world to put a woman right, when &s;he &s;ets out wrong. If it be generally &s;o with us, I am &s;ure we ought to be very careful of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;And has he not &s;aid, Lucy, that the be&s;t women, when wrong, are mo&s;t tenacious? It may be &s;o: But then I hope, he will allow, that at the time they <HI>think</HI> them&s;elves right.</P>
<P>I believe there is near 1200 <HI>l.</HI> &s;aid Mrs. Oldham, and look'd, the Ladies ob&s;erved, as if &s;he was afraid of their cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>Near 1200 <HI>l.</HI> Mrs. Oldham! &s;aid Mi&s;s Charlotte.
<PB N="219" REF="220">
&mdash;Lord, &s;i&s;ter, how glad would we have been &s;ome|times of as many &s;hillings between us!</P>
<P>And what, Caroline, what Charlotte, young Ladies as you were, but growing up into women, and in your father's hou&s;e, would you have done with more than current money? Now you have a claim to indepen|dency, I hope that 1200 <HI>l.</HI> will not be the &s;um of ei|ther of your &s;tores.</P>
<P>They courte&s;ied, they &s;aid; but yet thought 1200 <HI>l.</HI> a great &s;aving&mdash;Dear Ladies! how could you forget, and what a pain would it have been for your brother to have reminded you, that Mrs. Oldham had <HI>two</HI> children; to &s;ay nothing of a third!</P>
<P>Trembling, as they owned, Here, &s;aid &s;he, in this private drawer, are &s;ome pre&s;ents&mdash;I di&s;claim them. If you believe me, Ladies, I never wi&s;h'd for them. I never was &s;een in them but once. I never &s;hall wear them&mdash;offering to pull out the drawer.</P>
<P>Forbear, Mrs. Oldham. Pre&s;ents are yours. The money in that drawer is yours. Never will I either di&s;parage or dimini&s;h my father's bounty. He had a right to do as he plea&s;ed. Have not we to do as we plea&s;e? Had he made a will, would they not have been yours?&mdash;If you, Mrs. Oldham, if you, my &s;i&s;|ters, can tell me of any-thing he but intended or in|clined to do by any one of his people, that intention will I execute with as much exactne&s;s, as if he had made a will, and it was part of it. Shall we do no|thing but <HI>legal</HI> ju&s;tice?&mdash;The law was not made for a man of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Lord ble&s;s me, my Lucy! what &s;hall I do about this man?</P>
<P>HERE (would you believe it?) I laid down my pen; ponder'd, and wept, for <HI>joy;</HI> I think, it <HI>was</HI> joy, that there is &s;uch a young man in the world; for what el&s;e could it be?&mdash;And now, with a wa'try eye, twinkle, twinkle, do I re&s;ume it.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="221">
His &s;i&s;ters owned, they were confounded; but that &s;till the time was to come when they were to ap|prove, from their hearts, of what he &s;aid and did.</P>
<P>Mrs. Oldham wept at his goodne&s;s. She wept, I make no doubt al&s;o, as a penitent.&mdash;If my Ladies, &s;aid &s;he, will be plea&s;ed to&mdash;And &s;eemed to be about making an offer to them&mdash;of the jewels, as I &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ters, Mrs. Oldham, &s;aid Sir Charles, inter|rupting her are Grandi&s;ons. Pray, madam&mdash;holding in her hand, which was extended to the drawer&mdash;</P>
<P>She took out of another drawer 40 <HI>l.</HI> and &s;ome &s;il|ver. This, Sir, is money that belongs to you. I re|ceived it in Sir Thomas's illne&s;s. I have &s;ome other moneys; and my accounts wanted but a few hours of being perfected, when I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. They &s;hall be completed, and laid before you.</P>
<P>Let this money, Mrs. Oldham, be a part of tho&s;e accounts; declining, then, to take it.</P>
<P>There are Letters, Sir, &s;aid &s;he. I would with|hold nothing from you. I know not, if, among &s;ome things, that I wi&s;h not <HI>any-body</HI> to &s;ee, there are not concerns, that you ought to be made acquainted with relating to per&s;ons and things, particularly to Mr. Bever and Mr. Filmer, and their accounts. I hope they are good men.&mdash;You mu&s;t &s;ee the&s;e Let|ters, I believe.</P>
<P>Let me de&s;ire you, Mrs. Oldham, to make &s;uch extracts from tho&s;e Letters, or any others, as you think will concern me; and as &s;oon as you can: For tho&s;e gentlemen have written to me to &s;ign their ac|counts, which, they hint, had my father's appro|bation.</P>
<P>She then told Sir Charles (as I have already relat|ed) how earne&s;t Mr. Bever was to get to the &s;peech of Sir Thomas; and how mortified Mr. Filmer was to find him incapable of writing his name; which both &s;aid was all that was wanted.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t man, &s;aid Sir Charles, fears not in|&s;pection.
<PB N="221" REF="222">
They &s;hall want no favour from me. I hope nothing but ju&s;tice from them.</P>
<P>She then &s;hewed him &s;ome other papers; and while he was turning them over, the Ladies and &s;he withdrew to another apartment, in which, in two mahogany che&s;ts, was her wardrobe. They owned they were curious to in&s;pect it, as &s;he had always made a great figure. She was intending to oblige them; and had actually open'd one of the che&s;ts, and, tho' reluctantly, taken out a gown, when Sir Charles enter'd.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed di&s;plea&s;ed; and, taking his &s;i&s;ters a&s;ide, Tell me, &s;aid he, can what this poor woman &s;eems to be about, proceed from her own motion? I beg of you to &s;ay, you put her upon it. I would not have rea&s;on to imagine, that any woman, in &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances, could make a di&s;play of her apparel.</P>
<P>Why, the motion is partly mine, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, an&s;wer'd Charlotte.</P>
<P><HI>Wholly,</HI> I hope; and the compliance owing to the poor woman's mortified &s;ituation. You are young wo|men. You may not have con&s;ider'd this matter. Do you imagine, that your curio&s;ity will yield you plea&s;ure? Don't you know what to expect from the magnificent and bountiful &s;pirit of him, to who&s;e me|mory you owe duty?</P>
<P>They recollected them&s;elves, blu&s;hed, and de&s;i|red Mrs. Oldham to lock up the che&s;t. She did; and &s;eemed plea&s;ed to be excu&s;ed from the mortify|ing ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Ah, my Lucy, one thing I am afraid of; and that is, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, politely as he behaves to us all, thinks us women in general very pitiable creatures. I wi&s;h I knew that he did; and that for two rea&s;ons: That I might have &s;omething to think him blameable for: And to have the pride of a&s;&s;uring my&s;elf, that he would be convinced of that fault, were he to be acquainted with my grandmamma, and aunt.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="223">
But, do you wonder, that the &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e minds were thus open'd and enlarged by the example of &s;uch a brother, blazing upon them all at once, as I may &s;ay, in manly goodne&s;s, on his return from abroad, whither he &s;et out a &s;tripling, &s;hould, on all occa&s;ions, break out into raptures, whenever they mention THEIR brother?&mdash;Well may Mi&s;s Grandi|&s;on de&s;pi&s;e her Lovers, when &s;he thinks of him and of them at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday.</HI> Sir Charles is in town we hear: Came thither but la&s;t night&mdash;Nay for that matter, his &s;i&s;ters are more vexed at him than I am.&mdash;But what pre|tence have I to be di&s;turbed? But I &s;ay of him, as I do of Lady D.: He is &s;o good, that one would be willing to &s;tand well with him.&mdash;Then he is my <HI>Brother,</HI> you know.</P>

<P>AFTER Sir Charles had in&s;pected into every|thing in this hou&s;e, and taken minutes of papers, letters, writings, &amp;c. and lock'd up the plate, and other valuables, in one room, he order'd his &s;ervants to carry into Mrs. Oldham's apartment all that be|longed to her; and gave her the key of that; and di|rected the hou&s;e-keeper to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to her in the removal of them, at her own time and plea&s;ure, and to &s;uffer her to come and go, at all times, with free|dom and civility, as if &s;he had never <HI>left the hou&s;e,</HI> were his words.</P>
<P>How the poor woman courte&s;ied and wept, I war|rant! The dear girls, I am afraid, then envied her&mdash;and perhaps expre&s;&s;ed a grudging &s;pirit; for they &s;aid, This was their brother's addre&s;s to them at that time:</P>
<P>You may look upon the ju&s;tice I aim at doing to
<PB N="223" REF="224">
per&s;ons who can claim <HI>only</HI> ju&s;tice from me, as an earne&s;t, that I will do <HI>more</HI> than ju&s;tice to my beloved &s;i&s;ters: And you &s;hould have been the fir&s;t to have found the fruits of the love I bear you, had I not been afraid, that prudence would have narrowed my intentions. The moment I know what I can do, I will do it; and I reque&s;t you to hope, largely: If I have ability, I will exceed your hopes.</P>
<P>My dear &s;i&s;ters, continued he, and took one hand of each, I am &s;orry, for your <HI>&s;pirits</HI> &s;ake, that you are left in my power. The be&s;t of women was al|ways afraid it would be &s;o. But the moment I can, I will give you an ab&s;olute independence on your brother, that your actions and conduct may be all your own.</P>
<P>Surely, Sir, &s;aid Caroline (and they both wept) we mu&s;t think it the highe&s;t felicity, that we <HI>are</HI> in the power of &s;uch a brother. As to our <HI>&s;pirits,</HI> Sir&mdash;</P>
<P>She would have &s;aid more; but could not; and Charlotte took it up where her &s;i&s;ter left off: Be&s;t of brothers, &s;aid &s;he&mdash;Our <HI>&s;pirits</HI> &s;hall, as much as po&s;&s;ible (I can an&s;wer for both) be guided hereafter by yours.

<P>We will talk of the&s;e matters, replied he, when we can do <HI>more</HI> than talk. I will a&s;k you, Caroline, after your inclinations; and you, Charlotte, after <HI>yours,</HI> in the &s;ame hour that I know what I can do for you both, in the way of promoting them. Enter, mean time, upon your mea&s;ures: Reckon upon my be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Bani&s;h &s;u&s;pen&s;e. One of my fir&s;t plea&s;ures will be, to &s;ee you both happily married.</P>
<P>They did not <HI>&s;ay,</HI> when they related this to me, that they threw them&s;elves at his feet, as to their better father, as well as brother: But I fancy they <HI>did.</HI></P>
<P>He afterwards, at parting with Mrs. Oldham, &s;aid,
<PB N="224" REF="225">
I would be glad to know, madam, how you di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf: Every unhappy per&s;on has a right to the good offices of tho&s;e who are le&s;s embarra&s;s'd.

<P>And pray, and pray, a&s;k'd I of the Ladies, what &s;aid Mrs. Oldham? How did &s;he behave upon this?&mdash;</P>
<P>Our Harriet is &s;trangely taken with Mrs. Old|ham's &s;tory, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on&mdash;Why, &s;he wept plentifully, you may be &s;ure. She cla&s;ped her hands, and kneeled to pray to God to ble&s;s him, and all that&mdash;She could not do otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>See, Lucy!&mdash;But am I, my grandmamma; am I, my aunt, to blame? Is it incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;trict|e&s;t virtue to be charmed with &s;uch a &s;tory?&mdash;May not virtue it&s;elf pity the lap&s;ed?&mdash;O yes, it may! I am &s;ure, you, and Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, will &s;ay it may. A while ago, I thought my &s;elf a poor creature, compared to the&s;e two Ladies: But now I <HI>believe</HI> I am as good as they in &s;ome things.&mdash;But <HI>they</HI> had not &s;uch a grandmamma and aunt as I am ble&s;s'd with: <HI>They</HI> lo&s;t their excellent mother, while they were young; and their brother is but lately come over: And his &s;uperior excellence, like &s;un|&s;hine, breaking out on a &s;udden, finds out, and brings to &s;ight, tho&s;e &s;pots and freckles, that were hardly before di&s;coverable.</P>
<P>Sir Charles de&s;ired Mrs. Oldham would give in writing what &s;he propo&s;ed to do for her&s;elf, and for tho&s;e <HI>who were under her care.</HI> She did, at her fir&s;t opportunity. It was, That &s;he purpo&s;ed going to London, for the &s;ake of the young people's education: Of turning into money what jewels, cloaths, and plate, &s;he &s;hould think above her then &s;ituation in life:
<PB N="225" REF="226">
Of living retired in a little genteel hou&s;e: And &s;he gave in an e&s;timate of her worth: To what amount the Ladies know not: but this they know, that their brother allows her an annuity, for the &s;ake of her &s;ons by his father: And they doubt not but he will be &s;till kinder to them, when they are old enough to be put into the world.</P>
<P>This the Ladies think an encouragement to a guilty life. I will not dare to pronounce upon it, becau&s;e I may be thought partial to the generous man: But &s;hould be glad of my uncle's opinion. This, how|ever, may be &s;aid, That Sir Charles Grandi&s;on has no vices of his own to cover by the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his charity and beneficence, and if it be not good|ne&s;s in him to do thus, it is greatne&s;s; and this, if it be not prai&s;e-worthy, is the fir&s;t in&s;tance that I have known goodne&s;s and greatne&s;s of &s;oul &s;eparable.</P>
<P>The brother and &s;i&s;ters went down, after this, to Grandi&s;on-hall; and Sir Charles had rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the good order in which he found every-thing there.</P>

<P>I will not aim at being very particular in this part of the family-hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>When Sir Charles found that his father had left the in&s;pection of each &s;teward's account to the other, he enter'd into the examination of the whole him&s;elf, and tho' he allowed them &s;everal di&s;putable and un|proved charges, he brought them to acknowledge a much greater ballance in his favour, than they had made them&s;elves debtors for. This was the u&s;e he made of detecting them, to his &s;i&s;ters&mdash;You &s;ee,
<PB N="226" REF="227">
&s;i&s;ters, that my father was not &s;o profu&s;e as &s;ome people thought him. He had partners in his e&s;tate; and I have rea&s;on to think that he often paid intere&s;t for his own money.</P>
<P>On his &s;ettling with Filmer, the treaty with Mi&s;s Obrien came out. Mr. Filmer had, by &s;urprize, brought that beautiful girl into Sir Charles's pre&s;ence; and he owned to his &s;i&s;ters, that &s;he was a very lovely creature.</P>
<P>But when the mother and aunt found, that he only admired her as a man would a fine picture, they in|&s;i&s;ted that Sir Thomas had promi&s;ed to marry Mi&s;s Obrien privately; and produced two of his Letters to her, that &s;eemed to give ground for &s;uch an expecta|tion. Sir Charles was grieved for the &s;ake of his fa|ther's memory, at this tran&s;action; and much more on finding that the unhappy man went down to his &s;eat in E&s;&s;ex, his head and heart full of this &s;cheme, when he was &s;truck with his la&s;t fatal illne&s;s.</P>
<P>A meeting was propo&s;ed by Filmer, between Sir Charles, the mother, the aunt, and him&s;elf, at the aunt's hou&s;e in Pallmall. Sir Charles was very de|&s;irous to conceal his father's frailty from the world. He met them: But before he enter'd into di&s;cour&s;e, made it his reque&s;t to be allowed half an hour's con|ver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Obrien by her&s;elf; at the &s;ame time, prai&s;ing, as it de&s;erved, her beauty.</P>
<P>They were in hopes, that &s;he would be able to make an impre&s;&s;ion on the heart of &s;o young and &s;o lively a man; and complied. Under pretence of preparing her for &s;o unexpected a vi&s;it, her aunt gave her cue; But, in&s;tead of her captivating him, he brought her to &s;uch confe&s;&s;ions, as &s;ufficiently let him into the ba&s;ene&s;s of their views.</P>
<P>He returned to company, the young woman in his hand. He repre&s;ented to the mother the wickedne&s;s of the part &s;he had come over to act, in &s;uch &s;trong terms, that &s;he fell into a fit. The aunt was terrified.
<PB N="227" REF="228">
The young creature wept; and vowed that &s;he would be hone&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Charles told them, That if they would give him up his father's two Letters, and make a &s;olemn promi&s;e never to open their lips on the affair, and would procure for her an hone&s;t hu&s;band, he would give her 1000<HI>l.</HI> on the day of marriage; and, if the made a good wi&s;e, would be further kind to her.</P>
<P>Filmer was very de&s;irous to clear him&s;elf of having any hand in the blacker part of this plot. Sir Charles did not &s;eem &s;olicitous to detect and expo&s;e him: But left the whole upon his con&s;cience. And having made before &s;everal objections to his account, which could not be &s;o well obviated in England, he went over to Ireland with Filmer; and there very &s;peedily &s;ettled every thing to his own &s;atisfaction; and, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing him more genteelly than he de&s;erved, took upon him|&s;elf the management of that e&s;tate, directing &s;everal obvious improvements to be made, which are likely to turn to great account.</P>
<P>On his return, he heard that Mi&s;s Obrien was ill of the &s;mall-pox. He was not, for her own &s;ake &s;or|ry for it. She &s;uffer'd in her face, but &s;till was pretty and genteel: And &s;he is now the hone&s;t and happy wife of a trade&s;man near Golden-&s;quare who is very fond of her. Sir Charles gave with her the promi&s;ed &s;um, and another 100 <HI>l.</HI> for wedding-cloaths.</P>
<P>One part of her happine&s;s and her hu&s;band's is, that her aunt, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he had di&s;graced her&s;elf by this match, never comes near her: And her mother is re|turn'd to Ireland to her hu&s;band, greatly di&s;&s;atisfied with her daughter on the &s;ame account.</P>
<P>While the&s;e matters were agitating, Sir Charles forgot not to enquire what &s;teps had been taken with regard to the alliance propo&s;ed between him&s;elf and Lady Frances N.</P>
<P>He paid his fir&s;t vi&s;it to the father and brother of that Lady.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="229">
All that the &s;i&s;ters know of this matter, is, that the treaty was, on this fir&s;t vi&s;it, entirely broken off. Their brother, however, &s;peaks of the Lady, and of the whole family, with great re&s;pect. The Lady is known to e&s;teem him highly. Her father, her brother, &s;peak of him every-where with great re|gard: Lord N. calls him the fine&s;t young gentleman in England. And &s;o, Lucy, I believe he is. Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, Lord N. once &s;aid, knows better by non-compliance, how to create friend&s;hips, than mo&s;t men do by compliance.</P>
<P>Lady L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, who, as I have be|fore intimated, have another Lady whom they favour, once &s;aid to him, that the Earl and his &s;on Lord N. were &s;o con&s;tantly &s;peaking in his prai&s;e, that they could not but think that it would at la&s;t be a match between him and Lady Frances. His an&s;wer was, The Lady is infinitely de&s;erving: <HI>But it cannot be.</HI></P>
<P>I am ready to wi&s;h, he would &s;ay, what <HI>can</HI> be, that we need not&mdash;Ah, Lucy!&mdash;I know not what I would &s;ay: But &s;o it will always be with &s;illy girls, that di&s;tingui&s;h not between the <HI>would</HI> and the <HI>&s;hould.</HI> One of which, is</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL proceed with the family-hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Sir Charles forgot not, on his arrival in Eng|land, to pay an early vi&s;it to Lord W. his mother's brother, who was then at his hou&s;e near Wind&s;or.</P>
<P>I have told you, that my Lord had conceived a di&s;like to him; and that for no other rea&s;on, but be|cau&s;e his father loved him. Lord W. was laid up with the gout when he came: But he was in&s;tantly admitted to his &s;tately pre&s;ence. The fir&s;t &s;alutations,
<PB N="229" REF="230">
on one &s;ide, were re&s;pectful; on the other coldly civil. My Lord often &s;urvey'd his kin&s;man from head to foot, as he &s;at; as if he were loth to like him, I &s;uppo&s;e; yet knew not how to help it. He found fault with Sir Thomas. Sir Charles told him, That it was a very ingrateful thing to him to hear his father &s;poken &s;lightly of. He de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip to for|bear reflections of that &s;ort. My father, &s;aid he, is no more. I de&s;ire not to be made a party in any di&s;|putes that may have happen'd between him and your Lord&s;hip. I come to attend you as a duty which I owe to my mother's memory, and I hope this may be done without wounding that of my father.</P>
<P>You &s;ay well, &s;aid my Lord; but I am afraid, kin&s;man, by your air and manner, and &s;peech too, that you want not your father's proud &s;pirit.</P>
<P>I revere my father for his &s;pirit, my Lord. It might not always be exerted as your Lord&s;hip, and his other relations, might wi&s;h: But he had a manly one. As to my&s;elf, I will help your Lord&s;hip to my character at once. I am, indeed, a very proud man. I cannot &s;toop to &s;latter, and, lea&s;t of all men, the great and rich: Finding it difficult to re&s;train this fault, it is my whole &s;tudy to direct it to laudable ends; and I hope, that I am too proud to do any|thing unworthy of my father's name, or of my mo|ther's virtue.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, (and look'd at him again from head to foot) your father never in his whole life &s;aid &s;o good a thing.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip knew not my father as he de&s;erved to be known. Where there are mi&s;under&s;tandings between two per&s;ons, tho' relations, the character of either is not to be taken from the other. But, my Lord, this is, as I &s;aid before, a vi&s;it of duty: I have nothing to a&s;k of your Lord&s;hip, but your good opi|nion; and that no longer than I de&s;erve it,</P>
<P>My Lord was di&s;plea&s;ed. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You have nothing to a&s;k
<PB N="230" REF="231">
of me!"</Q>&mdash;repeated he. Let me tell you, <HI>independent</HI> Sir, that I like not your &s;peech. You may leave me, if you plea&s;e. And when I want to &s;ee you again, I will &s;end for you.</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, my Lord, and let me &s;ay, that I will not again attend you, till you do. But <HI>when</HI> you do, the &s;ummons of my mother's brother &s;hall be chearfully obeyed, when perhaps this unkind treat|ment of Lord W. might be remembred.</P>
<P>The very next day, my Lord hearing he was &s;till at Wind&s;or, viewing the curio&s;ities of the place, &s;ent to him: He directly went. My Lord expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf highly plea&s;ed with his readine&s;s to come, and apologized to him for his behaviour of the day before. He called him nephew, and &s;wore, that he was ju&s;t &s;uch a young man as he had wi&s;h'd to &s;ee. Your mo|ther u&s;ed to &s;ay, proceeded he, that you could do what you would with her, &s;hould you even be unrea|&s;onable! And I beg of you to a&s;k me no favour, but what is fit for me to grant, for fear I &s;hould grudge it after I had granted it; and call in que&s;tion, what no man is willing to do, my own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>He then a&s;k'd him about the methods he intended to take with regard to his way of life. Sir Charles an&s;wered, That he was re&s;olved to di&s;po&s;e of his racers, hunters, and dogs, as &s;oon as he could: That he would take a &s;urvey of the timber upon his e&s;tate, and fell that which would be the wor&s;e for &s;tanding; and doubted not but that a part of it in Hamp&s;hire would turn to good account: But that he would plant an oakling for every oak he cut down, for the &s;ake of po&s;terity: He was determined, he &s;aid, to let the hou&s;e in E&s;&s;ex; and even to &s;ell the e&s;tate there, if it were nece&s;&s;ary, to clear incumbrances; and to pay off the mortgage upon the Iri&s;h e&s;tate; which he had a notion was very improvable.</P>
<P>What did he propo&s;e to do for his &s;i&s;ters; who were left, he found, ab&s;olutely in his power?</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="232">
Marry them, my Lord, as &s;oon as I can. I have a good opinion of Lord L. My elder &s;i&s;ter loves him. I will enquire what will make him ea&s;y: And ea&s;y I will make him, on his marriage with her, if it be in my power. I will endeavour to make the younger happy too. And when the&s;e two points are &s;ettled, but not before, becau&s;e I will not deceive the family with which I may engage, I will think of my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Bravo! bravo! &s;aid my Lord; and his eyes, that were brimful &s;ome moments before, then ran over. As I hope to be &s;aved, I had a good mind to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;And there he &s;topt.</P>
<P>I a&s;k only for your approbation, my Lord, or cor|rection if wrong. My father has been very regard|ful of my intere&s;ts. He knew my heart, or he would perhaps have been more &s;olicitous for his daughters. I don't find that my circum&s;tances will be very nar|row: And if they <HI>are,</HI> I will live within compa&s;s, and even lay up. I endeavour to make a virtue of my pride, in this re&s;pect: I cannot live under obliga|tion. I will endeavour to be ju&s;t; and then, if I can, I will be generous. That is another &s;pecies of my pride. I told your Lord&s;hip, that if I could not conquer it, I would endeavour to make it innocent at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Bravo! bravo! again cried my Lord&mdash;And threw his arms about his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed his cheek, tho' he &s;creamed out at the &s;ame time, having hurt his gouty knee with the effort.</P>
<P>And then, and then&mdash;&s;aid my Lord, you will marry your&s;elf. And if you marry with di&s;cretion, good Lord, what a <HI>great</HI> man you will be!&mdash;And how I &s;hall love you!&mdash;Have you any thoughts of marriage, kin&s;man?&mdash;Let me be con&s;ulted in your match,&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;you will va&s;tly oblige me. Now I believe, I &s;hall begin to think the name of Grandi&s;on has a very agreeable &s;ound with it. What a fine thing it is, for a young man to be able to clear
<PB N="232" REF="233">
up his mother's prudence &s;o many years after &s;he is gone, and le&s;&s;en his father's follies! Your father did not u&s;e me well; and I mu&s;t be allowed &s;ometimes to &s;peak my mind of him.</P>
<P>That, my Lord, is the only point on which your Lord&s;hip and I <HI>can</HI> differ.</P>
<P>Well, well, we <HI>won't</HI> differ&mdash;Only one thing, my dear kin&s;man: If you &s;ell, give me the preference. Your father told me, that he would mortgage to any man upon God's earth &s;ooner than to me. I took that very heinou&s;ly.</P>
<P>There was a mi&s;under&s;tanding between you, my Lord. My father had a noble &s;pirit. He might think, that there would be a &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s in the appear|ance, had he a&s;k'd of your Lord&s;hip a favour. Little &s;pirited men &s;ometimes choo&s;e to be obliged to rela|tions, in hopes that payment will be le&s;s rigorou&s;ly exacted, than by a &s;tranger.&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah kin&s;man! kin&s;man!&mdash;That's the white &s;ide of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed, my Lord, that would be a motive with me to avoid troubling your Lord&s;hip in an exigence, were it to happen. For mi&s;tru&s;ts will ari&s;e from po&s;&s;ibilities of being ungrateful, when perhaps there is no room, were the heart to be known, for the &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Well &s;aid, however. You are a young man that one need not be afraid to be acquainted with. But what would you do as a lender? Would you think hardly of a man that wanted to be obliged to <HI>you?</HI></P>
<P>O no!&mdash;But in this ca&s;e I would be determined by prudence. If my friend regarded <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as the fir&s;t per&s;on in the friend&s;hip; <HI>me</HI> but as the &s;econd, in ca&s;es that might hurt my fortune, and di&s;able me from acting up to my &s;pirit, to other friends; I would then let him know, that he thought as meanly of my un|der&s;tanding as of my ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Lord W. was delighted with his nephew's notions. He over and over prophe&s;ied, That he would be a great man.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="234">
Sir Charles, with wonderful di&s;patch, executed tho&s;e de&s;igns, which he had told Lord W. he would carry into effect. And the &s;ale of the timber he cut down in Hamp&s;hire, and which lay convenient for water-carriage, for the u&s;e of the government, fur|ni&s;hed him with a very con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
<P>I have mentioned, that Sir Charles, on his &s;etting out from Florence to Paris, to attend his father's leave for his coming to England, had left his ward Mi&s;s Jervois, at the former place, in the protection of good Dr. Bartlet. He &s;oon &s;ent for them both over, and placed the young Lady with a di&s;creet widow-gen|tlewoman, who had three prudent daughters; &s;ome|times indulging her with leave to vi&s;it his &s;i&s;ters, who are very fond of her, as you have heard. And now let me add, That &s;he is an humble petitioner to me, to procure her the felicity, as &s;he calls it, to be con|&s;tantly re&s;ident with Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. She will be &s;he &s;ays, the be&s;t girl in the world, if &s;he may be allowed this favour: And not one word of advice, either of her guardian, or of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, or of Lady L. &s;hall be lo&s;t upon her&mdash;And be&s;ides, as good women, &s;aid &s;he, as Mrs. Lane and her daughters <HI>are,</HI> what protection can women give me, were my unhappy mother to be trouble&s;ome, and re&s;olve to <HI>have me,</HI> as &s;he is continually threatening?</P>
<P>What a new world opens to me, my Lucy, from the acquaintance I am permitted to hold with this fa|mily! God grant that your poor Harriet pay not too dearly for her knowledge!&mdash;She <HI>would,</HI> I believe you think, were &s;he to be <HI>entangled in an hopele&s;s Love,</HI></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXV. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON,</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>LORD L. came to town from Scotland within two or three months of Sir Charles's arrival in England. His fir&s;t vi&s;it was to the young Baronet; who, on my Lord's avowing his pa&s;&s;ion for his &s;i&s;ter, and her acknowledging her e&s;teem for him, introduced him to her, and put their hands together, holding them between both his: With plea&s;ure, &s;aid he, I join hands where hearts &s;o worthy are united. Do me, my Lord, the honour, from this moment, to look upon me as your brother. My father, I find, was a little embarra&s;&s;ed in his affairs. He loved his daugh|ters, and perhaps was loth that they &s;hould too early claim another protection: But had he lived to make him&s;elf ea&s;y, I have no doubt, but he would have made them happy. He has left that duty upon me&mdash;And I will perform it.</P>
<P>His &s;i&s;ter was unable to &s;peak for joy. My Lord's tears were ready to &s;tart.</P>
<P>My father, proceeded Sir Charles, in one of his Letters to me, acquainted me with the &s;tate of your Lord&s;hip's affairs. Reckon upon my be&s;t &s;ervices: Promi&s;e, engage, undertake. The brother, my Lord, hopes to make you ea&s;y: The &s;i&s;ter, will make you happy.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Charlotte was affected with this &s;eene; and &s;he pray'd, with her hands and eyes lifted up, that God would make his power as large as his heart: The whole world would then, &s;he &s;aid, be benefited either by his bounty, or his example.</P>
<P>Do you wonder now, my dear Mr. Reeves, that Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, Lady L. and Lord L. know not how to contain their gratitude, when this beneficent-minded brother is &s;poken of?</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="236">
And has not my Charlotte, &s;aid he, turning to|wards her, and looking at Mi&s;s Caroline, &s;ome happy man, that &s;he can di&s;tingui&s;h by her Love? You are <HI>equally</HI> dear to me, my &s;i&s;ters. Make me your con|fident, Charlotte. Your inclinations &s;hall be my choice.</P>
<P>Dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, why did you mi&s;lead me by your boa&s;ts of unre&s;ervedne&s;s? What room was there for re&s;erve to &s;uch a brother?&mdash;And yet it is plain, you have not let him know all your <HI>heart;</HI> and he &s;eems to think &s;o too. And now you are unea&s;y at an hint he has thrown out of that nature.</P>
<P>Two months before the marriage, Sir Charles put into his &s;i&s;ter's hands a paper &s;ealed up. Receive the&s;e, my Caroline, &s;aid he, as from your father's bounty, in compliance with what your mother would have wi&s;h'd, had we been ble&s;s'd with her life. When you oblige Lord L. with one hand, make him, with the other, this pre&s;ent: And intitle your&s;elf to all the gratitude, with which I know his worthy heart will overflow, on <HI>both</HI> occa&s;ions. I have done but my duty. I have performed only an article of the will, which I have made in my mind for my father, as time was not lent him to make one for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He &s;aluted her, and withdrew, before &s;he broke the &s;eal: And when &s;he did, &s;he found in it bank notes for 10,000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>She threw her&s;elf into a chair, and was unable for &s;ome time to &s;tir; but recovering her&s;elf, hurried out to find her brother. She was told, he was in her &s;i&s;ter's apartment. She found him not there, but Charlotte in tears. Sir Charles had ju&s;t left her. What ails my Charlotte?</P>
<P>O this brother, my Caroline!&mdash;There is no bear|ing his generous goodne&s;s. See that deed. See that paper that lies upon it. She took it up; and the&s;e were the contents of the paper:</P>

<P>Caroline found out her brother: But when &s;he ap|proached him, could not utter one word of what &s;he had meditated to &s;ay: But, dropping down on one knee, ble&s;&s;ed him, as &s;he owned, in her heart, both for Lord L. and her&s;elf; but could only expre&s;s her gra|titude by her lifted up hands and eyes.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he had rai&s;ed and &s;eated her, enter'd to them the equally grateful Charlotte. He placed her next her &s;i&s;ter, and drawing a chair for him&s;elf, taking an hand of each, he thus addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to them:</P>

<P>O my aunt! Be &s;o good, as to let the &s;ervants prepare my apartment at Selby-hou&s;e. There is no living within the blazing glory of this man!

This fault is <HI>pride.</HI> Do you mind <HI>what</HI> a &s;tre&s;s he lays now-and-then on the Family-name? and, as above, <HI>Dignity,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that becomes my &s;i&s;ters!</HI>&mdash;Proud mortal!&mdash;O my Lucy! he <HI>is</HI> proud, <HI>too</HI> proud, I doubt, as well as <HI>too</HI> con&s;iderable in his for|tunes&mdash;What would I &s;ay?&mdash;Yet, I know who would <HI>&s;tudy</HI> to make him the happie&s;t of men&mdash;Spare me, &s;pare me here, my uncle; or rather &s;kip over this pa&s;&s;age, Lucy.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, at the end of eight months from his father's death, gave Caroline, with his own hand, to Lord L.</P>
<P>Charlotte had two humble &s;ervants, Lord G. and Sir Walter Watkyns, as you have &s;een in my former Letters; but likes not either of them.</P>
<P>Lord L. carried his Lady down to Scotland, where
<PB N="238" REF="239">
&s;he was greatly admired and care&s;&s;ed by all his rela|tions. How happy for your Harriet was their criti|cally-propo&s;ed return, which carried down Sir Charles and Mi&s;s Charlotte to prepare every-thing at Colne|brooke for their reception!</P>
<P>Sir Charles accompanied my Lord and Lady L. as far on their way to Scotland as York; where he made a vi&s;it to Mrs Eleanor Grandi&s;on, his father's maiden|&s;i&s;ter, who re&s;ides there. She, having heard of his goodne&s;s to his &s;i&s;ters, and to every-body el&s;e with whom he had concerns, longed to &s;ee him; and on this occa&s;ion rejoiced in the opportunity he gave her to congratulate, to ble&s;s, and applaud, her nephew.</P>
<P>What multitudes of things have I farther to tell you, relating to this <HI>&s;trange</HI> man! <HI>Let</HI> me call him names.</P>
<P>I enquired after the hi&s;tory of the good Dr. Bartlett: But the Ladies &s;aid, As they knew not the whole of it, they would refer me to the Doctor him&s;elf. They knew however enough, they &s;aid, to reverence him as one of the mo&s;t worthy and mo&s;t pious of men. They believed, that he knew all the &s;ecrets of their brother's heart.</P>
<P>Strange, methinks, that the&s;e &s;ecrets lie &s;o <HI>deep!</HI></P>
<P>Yet there does not &s;eem any thing &s;o <HI>very</HI> forbidding, either in Sir Charles or the Doctor, but that one might a&s;k them a few innocent que&s;tions. And yet I did not u&s;e to be &s;o very curious neither. Why &s;hould I be more &s;o than his &s;i&s;ters?&mdash;Yet per&s;ons coming &s;trangers into a family of extraordinary merit, are <HI>apt,</HI> I believe, to be more inqui&s;itive about the affairs and particularities of that family, than tho&s;e who make a part of it: And when they have no other motive for their curio&s;ity, than a de&s;ire to applaud and imitate, I &s;ee not any great harm in it.</P>
<P>I was al&s;o very anxious to know, what, at &s;o early an age (for Sir Charles was not then eighteen) were the faults he found with the governor appointed for
<PB N="239" REF="240">
him. It &s;eems, the man was not only profligate him&s;elf, but, in order to keep him&s;elf in countenance, laid &s;nares for the young gentleman's virtue; which, however, he had the happine&s;s to e&s;cape; tho' at an age in which youth is generally unguarded. This man was al&s;o contentious, quarrel&s;ome, and a drinker; and yet (as Sir Charles at the time acknowledged to his &s;i&s;ters) it had &s;o very indifferent an appearance, for a young man to find fault with his governor, that, as well for the appearance-&s;ake, as for the man's, he was very loth to complain, till he became in&s;upport|able. It was mentioned, as it ought, greatly to the honour of the young gentleman's frankne&s;s and mag|nanimity, that when, at la&s;t, he found him&s;elf obliged to complain of this wicked man to his father, he gave him a copy of the letter he wrote, as &s;oon as he &s;ent it away. You may make, Sir, &s;aid he, what u&s;e you plea&s;e of the &s;lep I have taken. You &s;ee my charge. I have not aggravated it. Only, let me caution you, that, as I have not given you by my own mi&s;conduct any advantage over me, you do not make a &s;till wor&s;e figure in my reply, if you give me occa&s;ion to ju&s;tify my charge. My father loves his &s;on. I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be his &s;on. An altercation cannot end in your favour.</P>
<P>But, on enquiry into the behaviour of this bad man (who might have tainted the morals of one of the fine&s;t youths on earth), which the &s;on be&s;ought the father to make before he paid any regard to his com|plaints, Sir Thomas di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, and made a com|pliment to his &s;on, that he &s;hould have no other go|vernor, for the future, than his own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jervois's hi&s;tory is briefly this:</P>
<P>She had one of the be&s;t of fathers: Her mother is one of the wor&s;t of women. A termagant, a &s;wearer, a drinker, uncha&s;te&mdash;Poor Mr. Jervois!&mdash;I have told you, that he (a meek man) was obliged to abandon his country, to avoid her. Yet &s;he wants to have her
<PB N="240" REF="241">
daughter under her own tuition&mdash;Terrible!&mdash;Sir Charles has had trouble with her. He expects to have more&mdash;Poor Mi&s;s Jervois!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Emily's fortune is very great. The Ladies &s;ay, Not le&s;s than 50,000 <HI>l.</HI> Her father was an Italian and Turky merchant; and Sir Charles, by his manage|ment, has augmented it to that &s;um, by the recovery of &s;ome thou&s;ands of pounds, which Mr. Jervois had thought de&s;perate.</P>
<P>AND thus have I brought down, as briefly as I was able, tho' writing almo&s;t night and day (and greatly indulged in the latter by the Ladies, who &s;aw my heart was in the ta&s;k,) the hi&s;tory of this family, to the time when I had the happine&s;s (by means, however, mo&s;t &s;hockingly unde&s;irable) to be fir&s;t acquainted with it.</P>
<P>And now a word or two to pre&s;ent &s;ituations.</P>
<P>Sir Charles is not yet come down, Lucy. And this is Monday!&mdash;Very well!&mdash;He has made excu&s;es by his cou&s;in Grandi&s;on, who came down with my cou&s;in Reeves on Sunday morning; and both went up together ye&s;terday&mdash;Va&s;tly bu&s;y, no doubt!&mdash;He will be here to-morrow, I <HI>think,</HI> he &s;ays. His ex|cu&s;es were to his &s;i&s;ters and Lord L. I am glad he did not give him&s;elf the importance with your Harriet, to make any to her on his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on complains, that I open not my heart to her. She wants, &s;he &s;ays, to open hers to me; but as &s;he has intricacies that I cannot have, I mu&s;t <HI>begin.</HI> She knows not <HI>how,</HI> &s;he pretends. What her &s;ecrets may be, I pre&s;ume not to gue&s;s: But &s;urely I cannot tell a &s;i&s;ter, who, with <HI>her</HI> &s;i&s;ter, favours another woman, that I have a regard for her brother; and that before I can be &s;ure he has any for me.</P>
<P>She will play me a trick, &s;he ju&s;t now told me, if I will not let her know who the happy man in North|ampton&s;hire
<PB N="241" REF="242">
is, whom I prefer to all others. That there <HI>is</HI> &s;uch a one <HI>&s;omewhere,</HI> &s;he &s;ays, &s;he has no doubt: And if &s;he find it out, before I tell her, &s;he will give me <HI>no quarter,</HI> &s;peaking in the military phra&s;e; which &s;ometimes &s;he is apt to do. Lady L. &s;miles, and eyes me with great attention, when her &s;i&s;ter is raillying me, as if &s;he, al&s;o, wanted to find out &s;ome rea&s;on for my refu&s;ing Lord D. I told them an hour ago, that I am be&s;et with their eyes, and Lord L.'s; for Lady L. keeps no one &s;ecret of her heart, nor, I believe, any body's el&s;e that &s;he is mi&s;tre&s;s of, from her Lord. Him, I think, of all the men I know (my uncle not excepted) I could &s;oon|e&s;t intru&s;t with a &s;ecret. But, have I, Lucy, any to reveal? It is, I hope, a &s;ecret to my&s;elf, that never will be unfolded, even <HI>to</HI> my&s;elf, that I love a man, who has not made profe&s;&s;ions of Love to me. As to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on&mdash;But have done, Harriet! Thou ha&s;t named a name, that will lead thee&mdash;Whither will it lead me?&mdash;More than I am at pre|&s;ent my own, I am, and will be ever, my dear Lucy.</P>

<P>I WILL now tell you, who the Lady is, to whom the two &s;i&s;ters have given their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>It is Lady Anne S. the only daughter of the Earl of S. A va&s;t fortune, it &s;eems, independent of her father; and yet certain of a very great one from him. She is to be here this very afternoon, on a vi&s;it to the two Ladies. With all my heart. I hope &s;he is a very agreeable Lady. I hope &s;he has a capacious mind. I
<PB N="242" REF="243">
hope&mdash;I don't know what to hope&mdash;And why? Be|cau&s;e I find my&s;elf out to be a &s;elfi&s;h wretch, and don't wi&s;h her to be &s;o fine and &s;o good a woman, as I <HI>&s;ay</HI> I do. Is Love, if I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> own Love, a narrower of the Heart?&mdash;I don't know whether, while it is in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and is only on one &s;ide, it be not the parent of jealou&s;y, envy, di&s;&s;imulation; making the per&s;on pretend genero&s;ity, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and I cannot tell what; but &s;ecretly wi&s;hing, that her rival may not be &s;o worthy, &s;o lovely, as &s;he pretends to wi&s;h her to be.&mdash;Ah! Lucy, were one <HI>&s;ure,</HI> one could afford to be <HI>generous:</HI> One might then look down with pity upon a rival, in&s;tead of being mortified with appre|hen&s;ions of being looked down upon.</P>
<P>But I will be ju&s;t to the education given me, and the examples &s;et me. Whatever I &s;hall be able to do, or to wi&s;h, while I am in <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;e;</HI> when any happy wo|man becomes the wife of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, I will revere her; and wi&s;h her, for his &s;ake as well as her own, all the felicities that this world can afford; and if I cannot do this from my heart, I will di&s;own that heart.</P>
<P>The two Ladies &s;et upon Mr. Grandi&s;on on Sun|day, to get out of him the bu&s;ine&s;s that carried Sir Charles &s;o often of late to Canterbury. But tho' he owned, that he was not injoined &s;ecrecy, he affected to amu&s;e them, and &s;trangely to romance; hinting to them a &s;tory of a fine woman in love with <HI>him,</HI> and he with <HI>her;</HI> yet neither of them thinking of mar|riage: Mr. Grandi&s;on valued not truth, nor &s;crupled &s;olemn words, tho' ludicrou&s;ly uttered, to make the mo&s;t improbable &s;tuff perplexing and teazing; and then the wretch laughed immoderately at the &s;u&s;pen&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed he had cau&s;ed.</P>
<P>What witle&s;s creatures, what mere nothings, are the&s;e beaux, fine fellows, and laughers, of men!&mdash;how &s;illy mu&s;t they think us women!&mdash;And how
<PB N="243" REF="244">
&s;illy indeed are &s;uch of us, as can keep in counte|nance, at our own expence, their folly!</P>
<P>He was left alone with me for half an hour la&s;t night; and, in a very &s;erious manner, be&s;ought me to receive his addre&s;&s;es. I was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed with the two &s;i&s;ters; for I thought they intended to give him this opportunity, by their manner of withdrawing. Surely, thought I, I am not &s;unk &s;o low in the eyes of the Ladies of &s;uch a family as this, as to be thought by them a fit wi&s;e to the only worthle&s;s per&s;on in it, becau&s;e I have not the fortune of Lady Anne S. I will hear, thought I, what Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;ays to this; and, altho' I had made excu&s;es to my cou&s;in Reeves's, at <HI>their</HI> reque&s;t, for &s;taying here longer than I had intended, I will get away to town as fa&s;t as I can. Proud as they are of the name of Grandi&s;on, thought I, the name <HI>only</HI> won't do with Harriet Byron. I am as proud as they.</P>
<P>I &s;aid nothing of my re&s;entment: But told both La|dies, the moment I &s;aw them, of Mr. Grandi&s;on's declaration. They expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves highly di&s;|plea&s;ed with him for it; and &s;aid, they would talk to him. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;aid, She wondered at his <HI>pre|&s;umption.</HI> His fortune was indeed very con&s;iderable, &s;he &s;aid, notwith&s;tanding the extravagance of his youth: But it was an high degree of confidence, in a man of &s;uch free principles, to think him&s;elf intitled to countenance from&mdash;in &s;hort, from &s;uch a Lady, as your Harriet, Lucy; whatever you may think of her in the&s;e days of her humiliation.</P>
<P>She added the goodne&s;s of my heart to her com|pliment. I hope it is not a bad one. <HI>Then</HI> it was that I told them of my thoughts of going to town on the occa&s;ion: And the two Ladies in&s;tantly went to their cou&s;in, and talked to him in &s;uch a manner, that he promi&s;ed, if no more notice were taken of the matter, never again to give occa&s;ion for them to re|primand him on this &s;ubject. He had indeed, he
<PB N="244" REF="245">
owned, no very <HI>&s;trong a&s;pirations</HI> after matrimony; and had balanced about it a good while, before he could allow him&s;elf to declare his pa&s;&s;ion &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly: But only, as it was probable, that he might at one time or other enter the <HI>pale,</HI> he thought he never in his life &s;aw a woman with whom he could be &s;o happy, as with me.</P>
<P>But you &s;ee, Lucy, by this addre&s;s of Mr. Gran|di&s;on, that nothing is thought of in the family of <HI>an|other</HI> nature. What makes me a little more affected than otherwi&s;e I believe I &s;hould be, is, That all you, my dear friends, are &s;o much in love with this really great, becau&s;e good, man. It is a very happy cir|cum&s;tance for a young woman, to look forward to a change of condition with a man, of whom every one of her relations highly approves. But what can't be, can't. I &s;hall &s;ee what merit Lady Anne has by-and-by. But if fortune&mdash;Indeed, my dear, were I the fir&s;t prince&s;s on earth, I would have no other man, if I might have him. And &s;o I &s;ay&punc; that am but poor Harriet Byron. By this time Lady D. will have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures, I hope, as will not di&s;turb me in my re&s;olution. It is <HI>fixed,</HI> my dear. I cannot help it. I <HI>mu&s;t</HI> not, I <HI>ought</HI> not, I therefore will not, give my <HI>hand,</HI> whatever has pa&s;&s;ed between that Lady and my aunt, to any man living, and leave a pre&s;erence in my <HI>heart</HI> again&s;t that man. Gratitude, Ju&s;tice, Vir|tue, Decency, all forbid it.</P>
<P>And yet, as I &s;ee no hope, nor trace for hope, I have begun to attempt the conque&s;t of my <HI>hopele&s;s</HI>&mdash;What &s;hall I call it?&mdash;<HI>Pa&s;&s;ion?</HI>&mdash;Well, if I mu&s;t call it &s;o, I mu&s;t. A <HI>child in love-matters,</HI> if I did not, would <HI>find me out,</HI> you know. Nor will I, how|ever <HI>hopele&s;s,</HI> be a&s;hamed of owning it, if I can help it. Is not rea&s;on, is not purity, is not delicacy, with me? Is it <HI>per&s;on</HI> that I am in love with, if I <HI>am</HI> in love? No: It is virtue, it is goodne&s;s, it is genero|&s;ity, it is true politene&s;s, that I am captivated by; all
<PB N="245" REF="246">
centred in this one <HI>good man.</HI> What then have I to be a&s;hamed of?&mdash;And yet I <HI>am</HI> a little a&s;hamed now-and-then, for all that.</P>
<P>After all, that Love, which is founded on fancy, or exterior advantages, is a Love, I &s;hould think, that may, and oftentimes <HI>ought</HI> to be overcome: But that which is founded on interior worth; that blazes out when charity, beneficence, piety, fortitude, are &s;ig|nally exerted by the object beloved; how can &s;uch a Love as that be re&s;trained, damped, &s;uppre&s;s'd? How can it, without damping every &s;park of generous goodne&s;s, in what my partial grandmamma calls a <HI>fellow-heart,</HI> admiring and longing to promote and &s;hare in &s;uch glorious philantropy?</P>
<P><HI>Philantropy!</HI>&mdash;Yes, my uncle: Why &s;hould wo|men, in compliance with the petulance of narrow|minded men, forbear to u&s;e words that &s;ome &s;eem to think above them, when no other &s;ingle word will equally expre&s;s their &s;en&s;e? It will be &s;aid, They need not <HI>write.</HI> Well then, don't let them <HI>read:</HI> And carry it a little farther, and they may be forbidden to <HI>&s;peak.</HI> And every lordly man will then be a Grand Signor, and have his mute attendant.</P>
<P>But won't you think my heart a little at ea&s;e, that I can thus trifle? I would &s;ain have it be at ea&s;e; and that makes me give way to any chearful idea that ri&s;es to my mind.</P>
<P>The Ladies here have made me read to them &s;eve|ral pa&s;&s;ages out of my Letters to you before I &s;end them. They are more generous than I think I wi&s;h them to be, in allowing me to &s;kip and pa&s;s over &s;en|tences and paragraphs as I plea&s;e: For is not this al|lowing that I have &s;omething to write, or have writ|ten &s;omething, that they think I <HI>ought</HI> to keep from their knowledge; and which they do not <HI>de&s;ire</HI> to know? With all my heart. I will not be mean, Lucy.</P>
<P>WELL, Lucy, Lady Anne has been here, and is
<PB N="246" REF="247">
gone. She is an agreeable woman. I can't &s;ay but &s;he is <HI>very</HI> agreeable. And were &s;he actually Lady Grandi&s;on, I think I could re&s;pect her. I <HI>think</HI> I could&mdash;But O, my dear friends, what an happy creature was I, before I came to London!</P>
<P>There was a good deal of di&s;cour&s;e about Sir Charles. She owned, that &s;he thought him the hand&s;ome&s;t man &s;he ever &s;aw in her life. She was in love with his great <HI>character,</HI> &s;he &s;aid. She could go no-where, but he was the &s;ubject. She had heard of the affair between him and Sir Hargrave; and made me an hundred compliments on the occa&s;ion; and &s;aid, That her having heard, that I was at Clone|brooke, was one inducement to her, to make this vi&s;it.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, &s;he told Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, That &s;he thought me the prettie&s;t creature &s;he ever beheld.&mdash;<HI>Creature</HI> was her word&mdash;We are all creatures, 'tis true: But I think I never was more di&s;plea&s;ed with the &s;ound of the word <HI>Creature,</HI> than I was from Lady Anne.</P>
<P>MY aunt's Letter relating to what pa&s;&s;ed between her and Lady D. is ju&s;t brought me.</P>
<P>And &s;o Lady D. was greatly chagrined!&mdash;I am &s;orry for it. But, my dear aunt, you &s;ay, that &s;he is not di&s;plea&s;ed with me in the main, and commends my &s;incerity. That, I hope, is but doing me ju&s;tice. I am very glad to find, that &s;he knew not how to get over my prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in favour of another man. It was worthy of her&s;elf, and of my Lord D.'s character. I &s;hall always re&s;pect her. I hope this affair is quite over.</P>
<P>My grandmamma regrets the uncertainty I am in: But did &s;he not &s;ay her&s;elf, that Sir Charles Grandi&s;on was too con&s;iderable in his fortune; in his merit? That we were but as the private, he the public, in this particular? What room is there then for regret?
<PB N="247" REF="248">
Why is the word <HI>uncertainty</HI> u&s;ed? We may be <HI>certain</HI>&mdash;And there's an end of it.

"Lady Anne S. has a va&s;t for|tune."</Q> Is not that &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What hope can <HI>you</HI> have, Harriet Byron?"</Q>&mdash;Well, I don't care: This life is but a pa&s;&s;age, a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age, to a better: And let one jo&s;tle, and another elbow; another pu&s;h me, becau&s;e they know the weake&s;t mu&s;t give way; yet I will endeavour &s;teadily to pur&s;ue my cour&s;e, till I get thro' it, and into broad and open day.</P>
<P>One word only more on this &s;ubject&mdash;There is but one man in the world, whom I can hone&s;tly marry, my mind continuing what it is.

<P>SIR Charles is come at la&s;t! He came time enough to breakfa&s;t, and with him the good Dr. Bartlett. My philo&s;ophy, I doubt, is gone again, quite gone; for one while at lea&s;t. I mu&s;t take &s;anctuary, and that very &s;oon, at Selby-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Every word that pa&s;&s;es now, &s;eems to me worth repeating. There is no de&s;cribing how the pre&s;ence of this man animates every one in company. But take only part of what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="249">
We were in hopes, Sir Charles, &s;aid Lord L. that we &s;hould have had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you before now.</P>
<P>My heart was with you, my Lord: And (taking my hand; for he &s;at next me, and bowing) the more ar|dently, I mu&s;t own, for the plea&s;ure I &s;hould have &s;hared with you all, in the company of this your lovely gue&s;t.</P>
<P>[What bu&s;ine&s;s had he to take my hand? But in|deed, the character of <HI>brother</HI> might warrant the freedom.]</P>
<P>I was engaged mo&s;t part of la&s;t week in a very me|lancholy attendance, as Mr. Grandi&s;on could have informed you.</P>
<P>But not a word of the matter, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on, did I tell the Ladies; looking at his two cou&s;ins. I amu&s;ed them, as they love to do all mankind, when they have power.</P>
<P>The Ladies, I hope, cou&s;in, will puni&s;h you for this reflexion.</P>
<P>I came not to town till Saturday, proceeded Sir Charles; and found a billet from Sir Hargrave Pol|lexfen, inviting him&s;elf, Mr. Merceda, Mr. Bagen|hall, and Mr. Jordan, to pa&s;s the Sunday evening with me at St. James's-&s;quare. The company was not &s;uitable to the day, nor the day to the purpo&s;ed meeting. I made my excu&s;es, and de&s;ired them to favour me at breakfa&s;t on monday morning. They came. And when we were all in good humour with one another, I propo&s;ed, and was &s;econded by Mr. Jordan, that we would make a vi&s;it&mdash;You will hardly gue&s;s to whom, Mi&s;s Byron&mdash;It was to the widow Awberry at Paddington.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted, and even trembled. What I &s;uffered there, was all in my mind.</P>
<P>He proceeded then to tell me, that he had, tho' not without &s;ome difficulty on Sir Hargrave's part, en|gaged him to draw upon his banker for the 100<HI>l.</HI> he had promi&s;ed Wil&s;on; on Mr. Merceda on his banker
<PB N="249" REF="250">
for 50 <HI>l.</HI> and he him&s;elf generou&s;ly added 50 <HI>l.</HI> more; and, giving, as he &s;aid, the air of a frolick to the performance of a promi&s;e, they all of them went to Paddington. There &s;atisfying them&s;elves of the girl's love for Wil&s;on, and of the widow's opinion of Wil&s;on's good intentions by the girl; they let them know, that the &s;um of 200 <HI>l.</HI> was depo&s;ited in Sir Charles's hands to be paid on the day of marriage, as a portion for the young woman; and bid them de|mand it as &s;oon as they thought fit. Neither Wil&s;on nor the widow's &s;on was there. The widow and her daughters were overjoy'd at this unexpected good news.</P>
<P>They afterwards &s;hew'd Sir Charles, it &s;eems, every &s;cene of my di&s;tre&s;s; and told him, and the gentlemen, all but Sir Hargrave (who had not patience to hear it, and went into another room) my whole &s;ad &s;tory. Sir Charles was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, That he was &s;o much affected with it, that he had &s;ome little difficulty, on joining Sir Hargrave, to be as civil to him as he was before he heard the relation.</P>
<P>To one condition, it &s;eems, the gentlemen in&s;i&s;ted Sir Charles &s;hould con&s;ent, as an inducement for them to comply with his propo&s;al. It was, that Sir Charles &s;hould dine with Sir Hargrave and the company at his hou&s;e on the fore&s;t, &s;ome one day in the next week, of which they would give him notice. They all in&s;i&s;ted upon it; and Sir Charles &s;aid, he came the more readily into the propo&s;al, as they declared, it would be the la&s;t time they &s;hould &s;ee him, for at lea&s;t a twelvemonth to come; they being determined to pro&s;ecute their intended tour.</P>
<P>Wil&s;on and young Awberry waited on Sir Charles the &s;ame evening. The marriage is to be celebrated in a few days. Wil&s;on &s;ays, that his widow-&s;i&s;ter in Smithfield will, he is &s;ure, admit him into a partner|&s;hip with her, now that he &s;hall have &s;omething to carry into the &s;tock; for &s;he loves his wi&s;e-elect; and
<PB N="250" REF="251">
the &s;aving both of body and &s;oul, will be owing, he declared (with tran&s;port that left him &s;peechle&s;s) to Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Every-body was delighted with the relation he gave. Dear Sir Charles, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on, let me be al|lowed to believe the Roman Catholic doctrine of Su|pererogation; and let me expre&s;s my hope, that I your kin&s;man may be the better for your good works. If all you do, is but nece&s;&s;ary, the Lord have mercy upon me!</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on &s;aid, if I had written to my friends the account of what I &s;uffered from the vile at|tempt of Sir Hargrave, as &s;he doubted not but I had, Lady L. as well as her&s;elf, would take it for a parti|cular mark of my confidence, if they might be allowed to peru&s;e it,</P>
<P>When I am favoured, reply'd I, with the return of my Letters, I will very chearfully communicate to you, my dear Ladies, my relation of this &s;hocking affair.</P>
<P>They all expre&s;&s;ed a plea&s;ure in my frankne&s;s. Sir Charles &s;aid, he admired me beyond expre&s;&s;ion, for that noble criterion of Innocence and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>There, Lucy!</P>
<P>I think there is nothing in that part, but what they may &s;ee.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>THE two &s;i&s;ters and Lord L. were then &s;olicitous to know what was the occa&s;ion, which he called melancholy, that had engaged his attendance &s;o many days at Canterbury.</P>
<P>It is <HI>really</HI> a melancholy occa&s;ion, reply'd he. You mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed, my Lord; nor you, my &s;i&s;ters, if you &s;ee me in mourning in a few days. His &s;i&s;ters
<PB N="251" REF="252">
&s;tarted. And &s;o, <HI>truly,</HI> mu&s;t I. But I am his third &s;i&s;ter, you know. He &s;eemed in ha&s;te to explain him|&s;elf, left he &s;hould keep us in painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e. My journeyings to Canterbury have been occa&s;ioned by the melancholy nece&s;&s;ity of vi&s;iting a &s;ick friend, who is now no more.</P>
<P>You had all &s;uch an opinion, &s;aid Mr. Grandi&s;on, that I could keep no &s;ecret, that&mdash;</P>
<P>You were re&s;olved, interrupted Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, to &s;ay any-thing but the truth. Indeed, cou&s;in, you had better have been &s;ilent at this time&mdash;Is there a nece&s;|&s;ity, brother, for <HI>us</HI> to go into mourning?</P>
<P>There is not. I had a true value for the departed. But cu&s;tom will oblige me to mourn outwardly, as an <HI>executor</HI> only. And I have given orders about that, and other nece&s;&s;ary matters.</P>
<P>Did we know the decea&s;ed gentleman, brother? &s;aid Lady L.</P>
<P>No. His name was Danby. He was an eminent merchant; an Engli&s;hman; but, from his youth, &s;ettled in France. He had for months been in a lan|gui&s;hing &s;tate of health; and at la&s;t, finding his re|covery de&s;perate, was de&s;irous to die in his native country. He landed at Dover about two months ago: But his malady &s;o greatly increa&s;ed, that he was obliged to &s;top at Canterbury in his way to town; and there at la&s;t he yielded to the common de&s;tiny. The body was to be brought to town as this night. I have order'd it to an undertaker's. I mu&s;t lock my&s;elf up for a day or two, when I go to town. His concerns are large; but he told me, not intricate. He de&s;ired, that his will might not be opened 'till after his interrment; and that that might be private. He has two nephews, and a niece. I would have had him join them in the tru&s;t with me: But he refu&s;ed to do &s;o. An attempt once had been made upon his life, by villains &s;et at work by a wicked brother, father of tho&s;e nephews, and that niece, of which they were innocent: They
<PB N="252" REF="253">
are worthy young people. I had the happine&s;s to &s;ave his life: But had no merit in it; for my own &s;afety was involved in his. I am afraid he has been too grateful.</P>
<P>But, my good brother, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, were you not a little re&s;erved on this occa&s;ion? You went and returned, and went and returned, to Canterbury, and never &s;aid one word to us of the call you had to go thither. For my part, I thought there was a La|dy in the ca&s;e, I do a&s;&s;ure you.</P>
<P>My re&s;erve, as you call it, Charlotte, was rather accidental, than de&s;igned; and yet I do now-and-then treat your agreeable curio&s;ity as mariners are &s;aid to do a whale; I throw out a tub. But this was too melancholy an occa&s;ion to be &s;ported with. I was affected by it. Had the gentleman lived to come to town, you would all have been acquainted with him. I love to communicate plea&s;ure, but not pain; when, e&s;pecially, no good end can be an&s;wered by the commu|nication. I go to different places, and return, and hardly think it worth troubling my &s;i&s;ters with every movement. Had I thought you had any curio&s;ity a|bout my little journeyings to Canterbury, you &s;hould have had it an&s;wered. And yet I know my &s;i&s;ter Charlotte loves to puzzle, and find out &s;ecrets where none are intended.</P>
<P>She blu&s;h'd; and &s;o did I. Your &s;ervant, Sir, was all &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>But, Charlotte, proceeded he, you thought it was a <HI>Lady</HI> that I vi&s;ited: You know not your brother. I never will keep a &s;ecret of that nature from <HI>you,</HI> my good Lord, nor from <HI>you,</HI> my &s;i&s;ters, when I find my&s;elf either encouraged or inclined to make a &s;econd vi&s;it. It is for <HI>your</HI> Sex, Charlotte to be very chary of &s;uch &s;ecrets; and rea&s;on good, if you have any doubt, either of the man's worthine&s;s, or of your own con&s;equence with him.</P>
<P>He looked very earne&s;tly at her, but &s;miled.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="254">
So, my brother! I thank you, humourou&s;ly rubbing one &s;ide of her face (tho' &s;he needed not to do &s;o, to make both cheeks glow) this is another box on the &s;ame car. I have been unea&s;y, I can tell you, Sir, at an hint you threw out before you la&s;t went to Can|terbury, as if I kept you from &s;omething that it beho|ved you to know. Now, pray, Sir, will you be plea&s;ed to explain your&s;elf?</P>
<P>And, &s;ince you put it &s;o &s;trongly to me, Charlotte, let me a&s;k you, Have you not?</P>
<P>And let me a&s;k you, Sir&mdash;Do you think I have?</P>
<P>Perhaps, Charlotte, your &s;olicitude on this &s;ubject, now, and the alarm you took at the time, on a very &s;light hint, might warrant&mdash;</P>
<P>No <HI>warrants,</HI> brother!&mdash;Pray be &s;o good as to &s;peak all that lies on your mind.</P>
<P>Ah, Charlotte! and looked, tho' &s;milingly, with meaning.</P>
<P>I will not bear this <HI>Ah, Charlotte!</HI> and that mean|ing look.</P>
<P>And are you willing, my dear, to try this cau&s;e?</P>
<P>I demand my tryal.</P>
<P>Charming innocence! thought I, at the time&mdash;Now &s;hall I find &s;ome fault, I hope, in this almo&s;t perfect brother. I triumphed in my mind, for my Charlotte.</P>

<P>I would not give that creature any advantage over me.</P>

<HI>Sir Ch.</HI> And that I might either provide the mo|ney that I thought due to her as my &s;i&s;ter, or take time to pay it, according to the circum&s;tances of her engagement; and take from her all apprehen&s;ions of controul, in a ca&s;e that might affect the happine&s;s of her life&mdash;The&s;e, and brotherly Love, were the mo|tives of my enquiry.</P>

But worth|le&s;s as tho&s;e are, to whom, for the &s;ake of the name, my father's e&s;tate is pa&s;&s;ed, I never grudged it to them till I came acquainted with the&s;e Grandi&s;ons.</P>

<P>Indeed, Lucy, I did pity her: Every one did; and &s;o did her judge, I dare &s;ay, in his heart. But ju&s;tice, my Lucy, is a &s;evere thing.

Lord G. made his court to her likewi&s;e; and applying to me, re|ceived the &s;ame an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I enter'd, however, into &s;erious talk with my &s;i&s;ter upon this &s;ubject. She a&s;k'd me what I thought of each gentleman. I told her frankly.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> And pray, brother be &s;o good as to re|peat what you &s;aid of them. Let Mi&s;s Byron be judge whether either of the portraits was very in|viting.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I told her, Mi&s;s Byron, that Sir Walter would, I pre&s;umed, be thought the hand&s;omer man of the two. He was gay, lively, genteel; and had that courage in his air and manner, that Ladies were &s;el|dom di&s;plea&s;ed with. I had not, however, di&s;covered any great depth in him. My &s;i&s;ter, I imagined, if &s;he married him, would have the &s;uperiority in good &s;en&s;e: But I que&s;tion'd whether Sir Walter would ea&s;ily find that out; or allow it, if he did. He
<PB N="260" REF="261">
was a bri&s;k man for an hour, and might have wit and &s;en&s;e too; but indeed I hardly ever &s;aw him out of Ladies company; and he &s;eemed to be of opinion, that fla&s;h rather than fire, was what would recom|mend him to them. Sometimes I have thought, I told her, that women of &s;en&s;e &s;hould puni&s;h &s;uch men with their contempt, and not reward them with their approbation, for thus indirectly affronting their un|der&s;tandings: But that I had known women of &s;en&s;e approve a man of that character; and each woman mu&s;t determine for her&s;elf, what appeared mo&s;t a|greeable to her.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> (whi&s;pering) Well, Harriet&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Har.</HI> (whi&s;pering) Don t interrupt him.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> You remember, my dear Charlotte, that it was in this kind of way I &s;poke about Sir Walter Watkyns; and added, That he was independent; in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the family-e&s;tate, which I believed was a good one; and that he talked hand&s;omely to me of &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>I do remember this, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on; and whi&s;pering me, I am afraid, &s;aid &s;he, he knows too much; but the <HI>per&s;on</HI> he cannot know.&mdash;Well, Sir, and pray be plea&s;ed to repeat what you &s;aid of Lord G.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Lord G. told you, was a gay-dre&s;&s;ing man, but of a graver ca&s;t than the other. The fa&s;hi|on, rather than his inclination, &s;eemed to govern his outward appearance. He was a mode&s;t man, and I feared had too much doubt of him&s;elf to appear with that dignity in the eye of a lively woman, which &s;hould give him a fir&s;t con&s;equence with her.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Your &s;ervant, Sir.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I believed he would make a good hu&s;band: So perhaps might Sir Walter: But the one would <HI>bear,</HI> and the other perhaps mu&s;t be <HI>borne with.</HI> Ladies, as well as men, I pre&s;umed, had &s;ome &s;oibles, that they would not care to part with. As to fortune, I added,
<PB N="261" REF="262">
that Lord G. was dependent on his father's plea&s;ure. He had, indeed, his father's entire approbation, I found, in his addre&s;s: And I hoped that a &s;i&s;ter of mine would not wi&s;h for any man's death, for the &s;ake of either title or fortune. You have &s;een Lord G. Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P><HI>Har.</HI> What, Sir Charles, was Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's an&s;wer?</P>
<P>I did not care to give any opinion, that might either <HI>hurt</HI> or <HI>humour</HI> my Charlotte.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Charlotte told me, in &s;o many words, That &s;he did not approve of either. Each gentleman, &s;aid I, has be&s;ought me to be his advocate: A ta&s;k that I have not undertaken. I only told them, That I would talk to my &s;i&s;ter upon the &s;ubject: But did not think a brother ought to expect an influence over a &s;i&s;ter, where the gentlemen &s;u&s;pected their own. You will remember, &s;aid I to my &s;i&s;ter, that women cannot choo&s;e where they will; and that the &s;ame man can|not be every-thing&mdash;She de&s;ired me to tell her, which of the two <HI>I</HI> would prefer?&mdash;Fir&s;t, &s;aid I&punc; let me re|peat the que&s;tion I have more than once put to you&mdash;Have you any the lea&s;t &s;hadow of a preference in your heart, to any third per&s;on?&mdash;What was my &s;i&s;ter's an|&s;wer? She &s;aid, She had not. And yet, had I not had the private intelligence I hinted at, I &s;hould have been apt to imagine, that I had &s;ome rea&s;on to repeat the que&s;tion, from the <HI>warmth,</HI> both of <HI>manner</HI> and <HI>accent,</HI> with which &s;he declared, that &s;he approved of neither. Women, I believe, do not, with <HI>earne&s;tne&s;s,</HI> reject a man who is not <HI>quite</HI> di&s;agreeable, and to who&s;e qua|lity and fortune there can be no objection, if they are ab&s;olutely unprejudiced in another's favour.</P>
<P>We women look'd upon one another. I have no <HI>doubt,</HI> thought I, but Sir Charles came <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> by his knowlege of us. The dear Charlotte &s;at unea&s;y. He proceeded.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="263">
However, I now made no que&s;tion but my &s;i&s;ter's affections were ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged. My dear Char|lotte, &s;aid I, I would rather be excu&s;ed telling you, which gentleman's &s;uit I &s;hould incline to favour, le&s;t my opinion &s;hould not have your inclination with it; and your mind, by that means, &s;hould &s;uffer any em|barra&s;ment. She de&s;ired to know it.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You were very generous, Sir; I owned you were, in this point, as well as in all others.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I then declared in &s;avour of Lord G. as the man who would be mo&s;t likely to make her happy; who would think him&s;elf mo&s;t obliged to her for her favour: And I took the liberty to hint, that tho' I ad|mired her for her vivacity, and even, when her wit carried its keene&s;t edge, loved to be awakened by it, and wi&s;hed it never to lo&s;e that edge; yet I imagined that it would <HI>hurt</HI> &s;uch a man as Sir Walter. Lord G. it would <HI>enliven:</HI> And I hoped, if &s;he took plea&s;ure in her innocent fallies, that &s;he would think it <HI>&s;ome|thing,</HI> &s;o to choo&s;e, as that &s;he &s;hould not be under a nece&s;&s;ity of repre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e &s;prightly powers, that <HI>very &s;eldom</HI> were to be wi&s;hed to be reined in.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> True, Sir. You &s;aid, <HI>very &s;eldom.</HI> I re|member.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I never will flatter either a prince, or a Lady; yet &s;hould be &s;orry to treat either of them rudely. She then a&s;ked me after my <HI>own</HI> inclinations. I took this for a de&s;ire to avoid the &s;ubject we were upon; and would have <HI>withdrawn;</HI> but not in ill|humour. There was no rea&s;on for it. My &s;i&s;ter was not obliged to follow me in a &s;ubject that was not agreeable to her: But I took care to let her know that <HI>her</HI> que&s;tion was not a di&s;agreeable one to <HI>me:</HI> But would be more properly an&s;wered on &s;ome other oc|ca&s;ion. She would have had me to &s;tay.&mdash;For the &s;ake of the former &s;ubject, do you a&s;k me to &s;tay, Charlotte? No, &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="264">
Well then, my dear, take time to con&s;ider of it; and at &s;ome other opportunity we will re&s;ume it. Thus tender did I <HI>intend</HI> to be, with regard to my &s;i&s;ter's inclinations.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on wiped her eyes&mdash;And &s;aid, but with an accent that had a little peevi&s;hne&s;s in it, You wanted not, Sir, all this preparation. Nobody has the &s;hadow of belief, that <HI>you</HI> could be wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> If this, Charlotte, be well &s;aid; if, in that accent, it be <HI>generou&s;ly</HI> &s;aid; I have done&mdash;And from my heart acquit you, and as cordially condemn my|&s;elf, if I have appeared in your eye to intend to rai&s;e my own character, at the expence of yours.

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Pardon me, brother. You can add for|givene&s;s to the other obligations under which I la|bour. I was petulent.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I do; mo&s;t cordially I do.</P>

<P><PB N="264" REF="265">
<HI>Sir Ch.</HI> My dear Charlotte, I have &s;aid enough to point your fault to your own heart. If you know it, <HI>that,</HI> I hope, is &s;ufficient.&mdash;Do not imagine, my dear, that I want to controul you&mdash;But&mdash;He &s;topt.</P>

<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> That there is a man whom you can approve of&mdash;notwith&s;tanding&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> All I have &s;aid to the contrary. Well, Sir, if there be, it is a great fault to have denied it.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> That is all I mean&mdash;It is no fault in you to prefer one man to another. It is no fault in you to give this preference to any man, without con&s;ulting your brother. I propo&s;ed that you &s;hould be entirely mi&s;tre&s;s of your own conduct and actions. It would have been ungenerous in me, to have &s;uppo&s;ed you ac|countable to me, who had done no more than my duty by you. Dear Charlotte, do not imagine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> capable of laying &s;uch a load on your free will: But I &s;hould not have been made to pronounce to Lord G. and even to the Earl his father (on their enquirie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, whether your affections were or were not engaged&punc; in &s;uch a manner as gave them hopes of &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Are you &s;ure, Sir?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> O my &s;i&s;ter, how hard fought (now mu&s;t I &s;ay?) is this battle!&mdash;I can urge it no farther. For <HI>your</HI> &s;ake, I can urge it no farther.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Name your man, Sir!&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Not <HI>my</HI> man, Charlotte&mdash;Captain Ander|&s;on is not <HI>my</HI> man.</P>
<P>He aro&s;e; and, taking her motionle&s;s hand, pre&s;&s;ed it with his lips:&mdash;Be not too much di&s;turbed, &s;aid he I am di&s;tre&s;s'd, my &s;i&s;ter, for your di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;I think,
<PB N="265" REF="266">
more than I am for the error: And, &s;aying this, bow|ing to her, he withdrew.</P>
<P>He &s;aw and pitied her confu&s;ion. She was quite confounded. It was very good of him to withdraw, to give her time to recover her&s;elf. Lady L. gave her her &s;alts. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on hardly ever wanted &s;alts before.</P>
<P>O what a poor creature am I, &s;aid &s;he, even in my own eyes! Don't de&s;pi&s;e me, Harriet&mdash;Dr. Bartlett, can you excu&s;e me for &s;o <HI>&s;turdy</HI> a per&s;everance?&mdash;My Lord, forgive me;&mdash;Lady L. be indulgent to a &s;i&s;ter's fault. But my brother will always &s;ee me in this de|preciating light! "A battle hard fought," indeed! How one error, per&s;i&s;ted in, produces another!</P>
<P>When Sir Charles heard her voice, as talking, every one &s;oothing, and pitying her, he returned. She would have ri&s;en, with a di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemingly, as if &s;he would have humbled her&s;elf at his feet: But he took her folded hands in one of his, and with the other drew a chair clo&s;e to her, and &s;at down: With what &s;weet maje&s;ty, and mingled com|pa&s;&s;ion in his countenance! Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's <HI>con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s</HI> made it terrible <HI>only</HI> to her&mdash;Forgive me, Sir! were her words.</P>
<P>Dear Charlotte, I do. We have all &s;omething to be forgiven for. We pity others then mo&s;t cordially, when we want pity our&s;elves. Remember only, in the ca&s;es of other per&s;ons, to &s;often the &s;everity of your virtue.</P>
<P>He had Mrs. Oldham in his thoughts, as we all af|terwards concluded.</P>
<P>We know not, &s;aid he, to what <HI>inconveniencies</HI> a &s;mall departure from principle will lead: And now let us look forward. But fir&s;t, Had you rather &s;hew me into your dre&s;&s;ing-room?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I have now no wi&s;h to conceal any|thing from the per&s;ons pre&s;ent. I will only withdraw for a few moments.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="267">
She went out. I followed her. And then, want|ing &s;ome-body to divide her fault with the dear Char|lotte blamed my <HI>na&s;ty</HI> &s;cribbling again: But for that, &s;aid &s;he, I &s;hould have told you all.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIX. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>MISS Grandi&s;on de&s;ired me to return to the company. I did. She &s;oon followed me; took her &s;eat; and, with an air of mingled dignity and concern, deliver'd her&s;elf after this manner.</P>

<P><HI>Sir. Ch.</HI> I would &s;pare my &s;i&s;ter the&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s.

You,
<PB N="267" REF="268">
Harriet, would no more excu&s;e me, than my brother, if I failed in either.</P>
<P>I bowed, and blu&s;hed. Sir Charles look'd at me with a benign a&s;pect.</P>
<P>My <HI>father,</HI> proceeded &s;he, thought fit to be, or to <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be, di&s;plea&s;ed with &s;omething that pa&s;&s;ed be|tween him and Lord L. on the application made by my Lord to him for my &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> He was not willing, perhaps that a treaty of marriage &s;hould be begun but at his own fir&s;t mo|tion, however unexceptionable the man, or the propo&s;al.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Every one knows that my father had great abilities; and they were adorned with vivacity and &s;pirit, that, where-ever pointed, there was no re&s;i&s;ting. He took his two daughters to ta&s;k upon this occa&s;ion; and, being de&s;irous to di&s;courage in them, at that time, any thoughts of marriage, he exerted, be&s;ides his authority, on this occa&s;ion (which I can truly &s;ay, had <HI>due</HI> weight with us both) that vein of humour and raillery for which he was noted; in&s;o|much that his poor girls were confounded, and unable to hold up their heads. My &s;i&s;ter, in particular, was made to be a&s;hamed of a pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;urely no young woman, the object &s;o worthy, ought to be a&s;hamed of. My father al&s;o thought &s;it (perhaps for wi&s;e rea|&s;on) to acquaint us, that he de&s;igned for us but &s;mall fortunes: And this depreciated me with my&s;elf. My &s;i&s;ter had a &s;tronger mind, and had better pro&s;pects. I could not but apprehend from what my &s;i&s;ter &s;uffer'd, what mu&s;t be <HI>my</HI> &s;ufferings in turn; and I thought I could be induced to take any &s;tep, however ra&s;h, where virtue was not to be wounded, rather than un|dergo what &s;he underwent from the raillery of a man &s;o lively, and &s;o humorous, and who &s;tood in &s;o ve|nerable a degree of relation to me. While the&s;e im|pre&s;&s;ions were &s;trong in my mind, Captain Ander&s;on, who was quarter'd near us, had an opportunity to fall
<PB N="268" REF="269">
into my company at an a&s;&s;embly. He is a &s;prightly man, and was well received by every-body; and par|ticularly a favourite of three young ladies, who could hardly be civil to each other, on his account: And this, I own, when he made a&s;&s;iduous court to me, in preference to them, and to every other woman, gave him &s;ome con&s;equence with me: And then being the principal officer in that part of the country, he was care&s;&s;ed, as if he were a general. A daughter of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on was deemed a prize worthy of his ambition, by every-body, as well as by him&s;elf: While this poor daughter, dreading the difficulties that her &s;i&s;ter had met with, and being led to think, by what her father declared to both &s;i&s;ters, that two or three thou&s;and pounds would be the height of her fortune, had only to apprehend, that a captain either of hor&s;e or foot, who had been perhaps for years a frequenter of public places, both in town and coun|try, in hopes of rai&s;ing his fortune, would think him|&s;elf but poorly paid for his pains (were &s;he even to obtain her father's pardon) &s;hould &s;he engage without waiting for his con&s;ent; as &s;he was urged to do, by letter, which he found ways un&s;uspectedly to &s;end her.&mdash;I hope, Sir, I hope, my Lord, and you, my two &s;i&s;ters, that you will <HI>now,</HI> from what I have &s;aid, acquit me of in&s;incerity, tho' you cannot of <HI>pa&s;t</HI> in|di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, my pride at times was piqued: Sometimes I declared off; at other times was pre|vailed upon by arts which men are ma&s;ters of, to go on again; till I found my&s;elf entangled, and at a lo&s;s to know how to go either backward or forward. The gentleman was indeed of a genteel family: But the ob|ject of my &s;i&s;ter's regard had &s;o much to be &s;aid for <HI>him;</HI> &s;tood &s;o well with my brother; and even with my father; was &s;o much the man of quality, in every re&s;pect, that a ra&s;h &s;tep in me would be look'd upon as the more di&s;graceful, on that account: And I could
<PB N="269" REF="270">
not but apprehend, that if I married Captain Ander|&s;on, I mu&s;t be pitied, rejected, &s;corned, for one while, if not for ever.</P>
<P>And what title, often thought I, when I permitted my&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to think, have I to give my father a <HI>&s;on,</HI> my brother, my &s;i&s;ter, my Lord L. (&s;hould he and my &s;i&s;ter marry) a <HI>brother,</HI> whom they would not have cho&s;en, nor will probably own?&mdash;Have they not a <HI>right</HI> to reject him, as <HI>their</HI> relation? And &s;hall Charlotte Grandi&s;on, the daughter of the mo&s;t pru|dent of mothers, take a &s;tep that &s;hall make her be looked upon as the di&s;grace of her family? Shall <HI>&s;he</HI> be obliged to follow a &s;oldier's fortune into different quarters, and perhaps to di&s;tant regions?</P>
<P>Such as the&s;e were, at times, my rea&s;onings; and per|haps they wouldhave had the le&s;s force with me, had I, in giving my&s;elf an <HI>hu&s;band,</HI> had none of the&s;e rela|tions living, on whom to obtrude a new one, to their di&s;like, by my marriage.</P>
<P>Hence I could not bear to reveal the matter to my &s;i&s;ter, who, in <HI>her</HI> choice, had &s;o much advantage over me. I thought within the&s;e few weeks pa&s;t, I could reveal it to my new-found &s;i&s;ter: and it was one of my motives to come hither, at your invitation, Lord and Lady L. when you told me &s;he was &s;o obliging as to accompany you down: But &s;he was <HI>everla&s;tingly</HI> writing; and I was &s;hy of <HI>forcing</HI> an opportunity, as none agreeably offer'd.</P>

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> (bowing to her brother) Captain Ander|&s;on <HI>is</HI> in town. I have &s;een him twice. I was to have &s;een him at the play, had I not come down to Colnebrooke. Not a tittle of the truth will I hide from you. Now I have recover'd the right path, not one wry &s;tep will I again willingly take. I have &s;uffer'd enough by tho&s;e I had taken, tho' I endea|vour'd to carry it off as well as I could (even &s;ome|times by a &s;pirit of bravery) when it lay heavy <HI>here</HI>&mdash;putting her hand to her heart.</P>
<P>Sir Charles ro&s;e from his &s;eat; and taking one of his &s;i&s;ter's hands between both his, Worthy &s;i&s;ter! Amiable Charlotte! After this noble frankne&s;s, I mu&s;t not permit you to accu&s;e your&s;elf. An error gracefully acknowledged, is a victory won. If you think Captain Ander&s;on worthy of <HI>your</HI> heart, he
<PB N="271" REF="272">
&s;hall have a place in <HI>mine;</HI> and I will u&s;e my intere&s;t with Lord and Lady L. to allow of his relation to <HI>them.</HI> Mi&s;s Byron and Dr. Bartlett will look upon him as their friend.</P>
<P>He &s;at down again; his countenance &s;hining with brotherly love.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> O Sir, what &s;hall I &s;ay? You add to my difficulties by your goodne&s;s. I have told you how I had entangled my&s;elf. Captain Ander&s;on's addre&s;s began with hopes of a great fortune&punc; which he ima|gined a daughter of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on could not &s;ail, fir&s;t or la&s;t, to have. That this was his principal motive, has been, on many occa&s;ions (on too many for his advantage) vi&s;ible to me. <HI>My</HI> allowance of his addre&s;s, as I have hinted, was owing to my ap|prehen&s;ions, that I &s;hould not be a fortune worthy of a more generous man. At that time, our life was a confined one; and I girli&s;hly wi&s;hed for Liberty&mdash;MATRIMONY and LIBERTY&mdash;Girli&s;h connexion! as I have &s;ince thought.</P>
<P>We could none of us help &s;miling at this lively fally: But &s;he went on more &s;eriou&s;ly.</P>
<P>I thought at fir&s;t, that I could break with him when I would: But he holds me to it; and the more, &s;ince he has heard of your goodne&s;s to me; and builds great hopes of future preferment on the alliance.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> But do you not love Captain Ander&s;on, my &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I believe I love him as well as he loves me. His principal view, as I have &s;aid, has come out, avowedly, to be my fortune. If I regulate my e&s;teem for him by his for me, I ought not, for the very rea&s;on that he likes me, to approve of him.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I do not wonder that the Captain is &s;erious to <HI>hold you to it,</HI> to u&s;e your words: But, my dear Charlotte, an&s;wer me, Have you had le&s;s liking to Captain Ander&s;on &s;ince your fortune is a&s;certained, and ab&s;olutely in your own power, than you had before?</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="273">
<HI>Mi&s;s. Gr.</HI> Not on <HI>that</HI> account, if I know my heart: But he has been a much more earne&s;t &s;uiter &s;ince your goodne&s;s to me was generally known, than before When public report had made me ab&s;olutely dependent on my brother; and dimini&s;hed (beyond the truth, as it has proved) the circum&s;tances of the family; and when my &s;i&s;ter and I were unhappy be|tween our fears and our hopes; I then heard but little from Captain Ander&s;on; and that little was <HI>&s;o</HI> pru|dent, and <HI>&s;o</HI> cold&mdash;But I had found out the man before.</P>
<P>Lord and Lady L. with warmth of voice, called him unworthy man. I thought him &s;o; and &s;o, by his looks, did Dr. Bartlett.</P>
<P><HI>Sir. Ch.</HI> Poor man!&mdash;He &s;eems to have been too prudent, to tru&s;t even to providence. But what, my &s;i&s;ter, <HI>are now</HI> your difficulties?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> They proceed from my folly. Captain Ander&s;on appeared to me at fir&s;t, a man of &s;en&s;e, as well as an agreeable man in his per&s;on and air. He had a lively and ea&s;y elocution. <HI>He</HI> &s;poke without doubt; and <HI>I</HI> had therefore the le&s;s doubt of his un|der&s;tanding. The man who knows how to &s;ay agree|able things to a woman, in an agreeable manner, has her vanity on his &s;ide; &s;ince, to doubt his veracity, would be to que&s;tion her own merit. When he came to <HI>write,</HI> my judgment was even &s;till more engaged in his favour than before. But when he thought him&s;elf on a <HI>&s;afe footing</HI> with me, he then lo&s;t his hand|writing, and his &s;tile, and even his orthography. I blu&s;h to &s;ay it; and I then blu&s;hed to &s;ee it.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Men will be men. It is natural for us, when we find out our imperfections, to endeavour to &s;upply them, or to glo&s;s them over to tho&s;e, who&s;e good opinion of us we wi&s;h to engage. I have known men who are not &s;o <HI>ready</HI> as the Captain &s;eems to have been, to find out their own defects. Captain Ander&s;on, perhaps, lo&s;t his letter-writer, by
<PB N="273" REF="274">
the &s;hifting of quarters. But it is &s;trange that a man of family, as the Captain is, &s;hould be &s;o very illi|terate.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> His early wildne&s;&s;es, as I afterwards heard, made him run from &s;chool, before he had ac|quired common &s;chool-learning. His friends bought him a pair of colours. That was all they would ever do for him: And his father marrying a &s;econd wife, by whom he had children, con&s;idered not him as one. This came out to be his &s;tory. But he di&s;played him|&s;elf to me in very different lights. He pretended to have a pretty e&s;tate, which, tho' not large, was well|conditioned, and capable of improvement; be&s;ides very con&s;iderable expectations. A mind that would not impo&s;e on another, mu&s;t lea&s;t bear to be impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf: But I could not help <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing</HI> him, when I found my&s;elf &s;o gro&s;ly impo&s;ed upon, by the letters he had procured to be written for him; and that he was not either the man of &s;en&s;e, or learning, that he would have had me think him.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> But what was the <HI>&s;afe footing,</HI> my &s;i&s;ter, that he thought he was upon with you?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> O Sir! while all the&s;e good appearances held in his favour, he had teazed me into a promi&s;e. And when he had gained that point&punc; <HI>then</HI> it was, or <HI>&s;oon after,</HI> that he wrote to me with his own hand. And yet, tho' he convinced me by doing &s;o, that he had <HI>before</HI> employed another, it was a point agreed upon, that our intercour&s;e was to be an ab&s;olute &s;e|cret; and I trembled to find my&s;elf expo&s;ed to his &s;cribe, a man I knew not; and who mu&s;t certainly de&s;pi&s;e the lover whom he helped to all his agreeable flouri&s;hes, and, in de&s;pi&s;ing <HI>him,</HI> mu&s;t probably de&s;|pi&s;e <HI>me.</HI> Yet I <HI>will</HI> &s;ay, that my letter were &s;uch as I can &s;ubmit to the &s;evere&s;t eye. It was indeed giving him encouragement enough, that I an&s;wered him by pen and ink; and he pre&s;umed enough upon it, or he
<PB N="274" REF="275">
had never dared to teaze me, for a promi&s;e, as he did for months before I made him one.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Women &s;hould never be drawn-in to fetter them&s;elves by promi&s;es. On the contrary, they ought always to de&s;pi&s;e, and directly to break with the man, who offers to exact a promi&s;e from them. To what end is a promi&s;e of this kind endeavoured to be ob|tained, if the urger &s;u&s;pects not the fitne&s;s of his ad|dre&s;&s;es in the eyes of tho&s;e who have a right to be con|&s;ulted; and if he did not doubt either his own merit, or the lady's honour and di&s;cretion?&mdash;Therefore wanted to put it out of her own power to be dutiful; or (if &s;he had begun to &s;werve, by li&s;tening to a clande&s;tine addre&s;s) to recover her&s;elf? Your father, my dear (but you might not know that) could have ab&s;olved you from this promi&s;e <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxx. 3, 4, 5.</NOTE>. You have not now, however, any-body to controul you: You are ab&s;olutely your own mi&s;tre&s;s: And I &s;ee not but a promi&s;e&mdash;But, pray, of what nature was this pro|mi&s;e?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> O my folly!&mdash;I declared, that I never would marry any other man without his con&s;ent, while he was &s;ingle. By this means (to my confu&s;ion) I own, that I made him my father, my guardian, my brother; at lea&s;t, I made the influences over me, of &s;uch of them as had been living, of no avail, in the mo&s;t material article of my life; teazed, as I told you, into it; and again&s;t my judgment.</P>
<P>Soon after, he let me know, as I &s;aid, in his own hand-writing, what an illiterate, what a mere &s;uper|&s;icial man I had entered into treaty with. And ever &s;ince I have been endeavouring by pen, as well as in per&s;on, to get him to ab&s;olve me from my ra&s;h pro|mi&s;e: And this was my view and endeavour before I had a title to the independence, in which, Sir, you was &s;o good as to e&s;tabli&s;h me.</P>
<P>I once thought, proceeded &s;he, that he would
<PB N="275" REF="276">
ea&s;ily have complied, and have look'd out el&s;ewhere for a wife; for I &s;ought not to <HI>fetter</HI> him, as you ju&s;tly call it: He was not of &s;o much con&s;equence with me; and this renders me, perhaps, the le&s;s ex|cu&s;eable:&mdash;But you held me not long enough in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, as to the great things you intended to do for me, to enable me to obtain that relea&s;e from Captain Ander&s;on, which I was meditating to procure, before he knew what tho&s;e were.</P>
<P>All this time I kept my own &s;ecret. I had not confidence enough in the &s;teps I had &s;o ra&s;hly taken (indeed had not <HI>humility</HI> enough) to make any living creature acquainted with my &s;ituation: And this was the rea&s;on, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I never was gue&s;&s;ed at, or found out. The proverb &s;ays&punc; <HI>Two can keep a &s;ecret, when one is away:</HI> But my Harriet knows [I bowed] that I very early, in my knowledge of her, dropt hints of an <HI>entanglement,</HI> as I ludicrou&s;ly called it; for I could not, with ju&s;tice, &s;ay <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sir. Ch.</HI> Charming frankne&s;s! How do your virtues &s;hine thro' your very mi&s;takes!&mdash;But there are many women who have &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be wor&s;e en|tangled, even beyond recovery, when they have not had to plead the apprehen&s;ions which you had at en|tering into this affair.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You are Sir <HI>Charles Grandi&s;on,</HI> Sir: I need no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ay more. We often dread, in ra&s;h encoun|ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> to make tho&s;e communications, which only can be means to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">ricate us from the difficulties into which we have plunged our&s;elves. Had I, for the la&s;t &s;ix or &s;even years of my life, known my brother as I now know him; had I been indulged in a corre&s;pon|dence with him in his ab&s;ence; not a &s;tep would I have taken, but with his approbation.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Perhaps I was too implicit on this occa&s;ion: But I always thought it more safe in a di&s;putable ca&s;e, to check than to give way, to an inclination. My fa|ther knew the world. He was not an ill-natured man.
<PB N="276" REF="277">
He loved his daughters. I had not the vanity to ima|gine, that my &s;i&s;ters, the <HI>younge&s;t</HI> near as old as my|&s;elf, would want my advice, in material articles: And to break thro' a father's commands, for the &s;ake merely of gratifying <HI>my&s;elf</HI>&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;But I could <HI>not</HI> do it: And as a con&s;iderate per&s;on, when he has lo&s;t a dear friend, and more particularly a parent, is apt to recollect with plea&s;ure tho&s;e in&s;tances in which he has given joy to the departed, and with pain the contrary; methinks I am the more &s;atisfied with my|&s;elf, for having obeyed a command, that however, at the time, I knew not how to account for.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You are happy, brother, in this recol|lection. I &s;hould be more unhappy than I am (on your principles) had I vexed my father in this affair. Thank God, he knew nothing of it. But now, Sir, I have told you the whole truth. I have not aggra|vated the failings of Captain Ander&s;on; nor wi&s;h to do &s;o; for the man that once I had but the &s;hadow of a thought to make one day my neare&s;t relation, is in|titled, I think, to my good <HI>wi&s;hes,</HI> tho' he prove not quite &s;o worthy, as I once believed him.</P>
<P>Permit me, however, to add, that Captain An|der&s;on is pa&s;&s;ionate, overbearing: I have never of late met him, but with great reluctance: Had I not come to Colnebrooke, I &s;hould have <HI>&s;een</HI> him, as I confe&s;&s;ed; but it was with the re&s;olution that I had for a con&s;iderable time pa&s;t avowed to him, Ne|ver to be his; and to be a &s;ingle woman all my life, if he would not di&s;engage me of my ra&s;h, my fooli&s;h promi&s;e. And now be plea&s;ed (looking round her to every one pre&s;ent) to advi&s;e me what to do.</P>
<P><HI>Lord. L.</HI> I think the man utterly unworthy of you, &s;i&s;ter Charlotte. I think you are right to re&s;olve ne|ver to have him.</P>

<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> A very proper que&s;tion.</P>

I would not to him, I never did, plead <HI>mine;</HI> tho' his example would excu&s;e me, if I did.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Was the promi&s;e given in writing, &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Indeed it was. She looked down.</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> May I be pardon'd, madam?&mdash;The &s;ub|&s;tance of your promi&s;e was, That you would never marry any other man without his con&s;ent, while he remained unmarried&mdash;Did you promi&s;e, that if ever you did marry at all, it &s;hould be to him?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> No. He wanted me to promi&s;e that; but I refu&s;ed. And now, my Harriet, what is your advice?</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> I beg to hear Dr. Bartlett's opinion; and yours, Sir (to Sir Charles) before I pre&s;ume to give mine.</P>
<P>Sir Charles looked at the Doctor. The Doctor referred him&s;elf to him.</P>

As to what Lord L. has &s;aid, I think with his Lord&s;hip, that Captain Ander&s;on appears not, in any of his conduct, to be worthy of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on: And in truth, I don't know many who are. If I am partial excu&s;e the <HI>brother.</HI></P>
<P>She bowed. Every one was plea&s;ed, that Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on was enabled to hold up her head, as &s;he did, on this compliment from her brother.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I think al&s;o, if my &s;i&s;ter e&s;teems him not, &s;he is in the right to re&s;olve never to be his. But what &s;hall we &s;ay, as to her promi&s;e, <HI>Never</HI> to be the wife of any other man without his con&s;ent&punc; while he re|mains unmarried? It was made, I apprehend, while her father was living; who might, I believe, Doctor, you will allow, have ab&s;olved her from it: But then, her very treating with him &s;ince to di&s;pen&s;e with it, &s;hews, that in her own con&s;cience &s;he thinks her&s;elf bound by it.</P>
<P>Every one being &s;ilent, he proceeded.</P>
<P>Lady L. is of opinion, that he acts ungenerou&s;ly and unworthily, to endeavour to hold her to an un|equal promi&s;e. But what man, except a <HI>very</HI> gene|rous one indeed, having obtained an advantage over &s;uch a woman as Charlotte [She redden'd] would not try to hold it? Mu&s;t he not, by giving up this advantage, vote again&s;t him&s;elf? Women &s;hould be &s;ure of the men in whom they place a confidence that concerns them highly. Can you think, that the man who engages a woman to make a promi&s;e, does not <HI>intend</HI> to hold her to it? When he <HI>teazes</HI> her to make it, he as good as tells her he <HI>does,</HI> let what will happen to make her wi&s;h &s;he had not.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> O my brother! The repetition of that word <HI>teazes!</HI>&mdash;Are you not raillying me?&mdash;Indeed I de&s;erve it.</P>

<HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> O my brother, what &s;hall I do, if you railly me on my folly?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> I mean not to railly you.

<P>She is apprehen&s;ive of blame on this head: But her &s;ituation will be con&s;ider'd: I <HI>mu&s;t not</HI> repeat the cir|cum&s;tances.

<P>As to the Captain's artifice to obtain a footing by letters of another man's writing; that was enough in|deed to make a woman, who her&s;elf writes finely, de&s;pi&s;e him when &s;he knew it.

Madam Maintenon, it is re|ported, was employed in this way, by a favourite mi&s;tre&s;s of Louis XIV.

<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, after &s;ome he&s;itation, replied, In|deed, Sir, Captain Ander&s;on is <HI>not</HI> worthy of being called your brother. I will not enter into the parti|culars of his unworthine&s;s; becau&s;e I am determined not to have him. He knows I am: Nor does my promi&s;e engage me to be his. Had he virtue, had he genero&s;ity&mdash;But indeed he has not either, in the de|gree that would make me re&s;pect him, as a woman &s;hould re&s;pect her hu&s;band.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Well then, Charlotte, I would have you excu&s;e your&s;elf, if you have given him hope of meet|ing him; let him know, that you have acquainted me with all that has pa&s;&s;ed between you; and that you refer your&s;elf wholly to me; but with a re&s;olution (if &s;uch <HI>be</HI> your re&s;olution) never to be his.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s. Gr.</HI> I &s;hall dread his violent temper.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Dread nothing! Men who are violent to a woman, when they have a point to carry by being &s;o, are not always violent to men. But I &s;hall treat him civilly. If the man ever hoped to call you his, he will be unhappy enough in lo&s;ing &s;uch a prize. You may tell him, that I will give him a meeting where|ever he plea&s;es. Mean time, it may not be ami&s;s, if
<PB N="282" REF="283">
you have no objection, to &s;hew me &s;ome of the letters that have pa&s;&s;ed between you; of tho&s;e particularly, in which you have declared your re&s;olution not to be his; the farther backward, the better, if from the date of &s;uch you have <HI>always</HI> been of the &s;ame mind.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You &s;hall &s;ee the copies of <HI>all</HI> my letters; and <HI>all</HI> his, if you plea&s;e. And you will gather from both, Sir, that it was owing to the unhappy &s;ituation I thought my&s;elf in, from the unkind treatment my &s;i&s;ter met with, and to the being forbidden to expect a fortune that would intitle me to look up to a man of figure in the world, that I was ever approachable by Captain Ander&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Sir. Ch.</HI> Unhappy! But let us look forward. I will meet Captain Ander&s;on. If there are any letters, in which he has treated my &s;i&s;ter undhand&s;omely, you mu&s;t not let me &s;ee them. My motive for looking into <HI>any</HI> of them, is &s;ervice to you, Charlotte, and not curio&s;ity. But let me, neverthele&s;s, &s;ee all that is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the que&s;tion, that I may not, when I meet him, hear any-thing from him, that I have not heard from you; and which may make for him, and again&s;t you. I do a&s;&s;ure you, that I will allow in his favour, all that &s;hall appear favourable to him, tho' again&s;t my &s;i&s;ter. I may meet him <HI>prejudiced,</HI> but not <HI>deter|mined:</HI> And I hope you &s;ee by my behaviour to you, Charlotte, that were you and he to have been fond Lovers in your letters, you need not be afraid of my eye. I never am &s;evere on Lovers foibles. Our pa&s;&s;ions may be made &s;ub&s;ervient to excellent purpo|&s;es. Don't think you have a &s;upercilious brother. A &s;u&s;ceptibility of the pa&s;&s;ion called <HI>Love,</HI> I condemn not as a fault; but the contrary. Your <HI>brother,</HI> La|dies (looking upon all three) is no Stoic.</P>
<P>And have you been in love, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on? thought I to my&s;elf&mdash;Shall I, Lucy, be &s;orry, or &s;hall I be glad, if he <HI>has?</HI>&mdash;But after all, is it not &s;trange, that in all this time one knows &s;o little of his hi&s;tory
<PB N="283" REF="284">
while he was abroad?&mdash;And yet, he &s;aid, That he was not angry at his &s;i&s;ter for que&s;tioning him on the &s;ubject. Had I been his &s;i&s;ter, que&s;tions of that &s;ort would not have been to be <HI>now</HI> a&s;ked.</P>
<P>But here is a new ta&s;k for her brother. I &s;hall long to know how this affair will end.</P>
<P>The tryal of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, as &s;he called it, be|ing thus happily over, and Mi&s;s Emily and Mr. Gran|di&s;on de&s;ired to walk in, Sir Charles took notice, with &s;ome &s;everity on our &s;ex, on the general liking, which he &s;aid women have for military men. He did not know he &s;aid, whether the army were not beholden to this approbation, and to the gay appearance officers were expected to make, rather than to a true martial &s;pirit, for many a gallant man.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you, Emily? &s;aid he? Do not a cockade and a &s;carlet coat, become a <HI>fine gentleman,</HI> and help to make him &s;o, in your eyes?</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed, Sir, to tell me how &s;uch a one &s;hould look in my eyes, and I will endeavour to make them conform to your le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>He bowed to the happy girl: For my part, &s;aid he, I cannot but &s;ay, that I di&s;like the life of a &s;oldier in general; who&s;e trade is in blood; who mu&s;t be as much a &s;lave to the will of <HI>his</HI> &s;uperiors in command, as he is almo&s;t <HI>obliged</HI> to be a tyrant to tho&s;e under him.</P>
<P>But as to the Sex, if it were not, that Ladies, where Love and their own happine&s;s interfere, are the mo&s;t incompetent judges of all others for them&s;elves&mdash;Pardon me&mdash;</P>
<P>Your &s;ervant, Sir, &s;aid Lady L.&mdash;And we all bow|ed to him.</P>
<P>How can a woman, proceeded he, who really loves her hu&s;band, &s;ubject her&s;elf of <HI>choice,</HI> to the nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;ences, to the continual apprehen&s;ions, which &s;he mu&s;t be under for his &s;afety, when he is in the height of what is emphatically called his DUTY? He &s;topt.
<PB N="284" REF="285">
No an&s;wer being made, Perhaps, re&s;umed he, i may be thus accounted for: Women are the mo&s;t de|licate part of the creation. Con&s;cious of the weak|ne&s;s of their &s;ex, and that they &s;tand in need of pro|tection (for apprehen&s;ivene&s;s the child of prudence&punc; is as characteri&s;tic in them, as courage in a man) they naturally love brave men&mdash;And are not all military men &s;uppo&s;ed to be brave?</P>
<P>But how are they mi&s;taken in their main end, &s;up|po&s;ing this to be it!</P>
<P>I honour a good, a generous, a brave, and humane &s;oldier: But were &s;uch an one to be the brave&s;t of men, how can his wife expect con&s;tant protection from the hu&s;band who is le&s;s his <HI>own,</HI> and con&s;equently le&s;s <HI>hers,</HI> than almo&s;t any other man can be (a <HI>&s;ailor</HI> ex|cepted); and who mu&s;t therefore, oftener, than any other man, leave her expo&s;ed to tho&s;e in&s;ults, from which &s;he &s;eems to think he can be&s;t defend her?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> (&s;miling) But may it not be &s;aid, Sir, that tho&s;e women who make &s;oldiers their choice, de&s;erve in &s;ome degree, a rank with heroes; when they can part with their hu&s;bands for the &s;ake of their country's glory?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Change your word <HI>glory</HI> for <HI>&s;afety,</HI> Lady L. and your que&s;tion will be &s;trengthen'd. The word and thing called <HI>Glory,</HI> what mi&s;chief has it not oc|ca&s;ioned!&mdash;As to the que&s;tion it&s;elf, were you <HI>&s;erious,</HI> let every one, I an&s;wer, who can plead the <HI>motive,</HI> be intitled to the <HI>prai&s;e</HI> that is due to it.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> There is &s;o much weight in what my brother has &s;aid, that I thank Heaven, I am not in danger of being the wife of a &s;oldier.</P>
<P>We, who knew what &s;he alluded to, &s;miled at it; and Mr. Grandi&s;on looked about him, as if he wanted to find more in the words, than they could import to him: And then was very earne&s;t to know how his cou&s;in had come off.</P>

<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> You have nothing new to fear, Mr. Grandi&s;on, I a&s;&s;ure you. I have been detected in real faults. I have been generou&s;ly treated; and re|pent of my fault. Let me have an in&s;tance of like ingenuou&s;ne&s;s in you; and I will &s;ay, there are hopes of us both.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> Your &s;ervant, cou&s;in. <HI>Either</HI> way I mu&s;t have it. But were you to follow the example by which you own your&s;elf amended, I might have the better chance, perhaps, of coming up to you in ingenuou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Upon my word, &s;i&s;ter Charlotte, Mr. Grandi&s;on has &s;aid a good thing.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I think &s;o too, my Lord. I will put it down. And if you are wi&s;e, Sir (to him) a&s;k me to &s;ew up your lips 'till to-morrow dinner-time.</P>

<P><HI>Sir. Ch.</HI> Fie, Charlotte!</P>
<P>I am glad, thought I, my good Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, that you have not lo&s;t much &s;pirit by your tryal!</P>
<P>MISS Grandi&s;on has &s;hewed me &s;ome of the letters that pa&s;&s;ed between Captain Ander&s;on and her. How mu&s;t &s;he have de&s;pi&s;ed him, had &s;he been drawn in to give him her hand! And the more for the poor figure he would have made as a brother to <HI>her</HI> brother! How mu&s;t &s;he have blu&s;hed at every civility paid him in &s;uch a family! Yet from pa&s;&s;ages in his letters, I dare &s;ay, he would have had the higher opinion of him&s;elf; fir&s;t for his &s;ucce&s;s with her, and for every civility paid him afterwards by her relations.</P>
<P>And thus had Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on, with all his pride, like to have thrown his daughter, a woman of

high character, fine under&s;tanding, and an exalted mind, into the arms of a man, who had neither for|tune, nor education, nor yet good &s;en&s;e, nor gene|ro&s;ity of heart, to countenance his preten&s;ions to &s;uch a Lady, or her for marrying beneath her&s;elf.</P>

<P>SIR Charles has already left us. He went to town this morning on the affairs of his executor|&s;hip. He breakfa&s;ted with us fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Dr. Bartlett, with whom already I have made my&s;elf very intimate, and who, I find, knows his whole heart, tells me he is always fully employed. <HI>That</HI> we knew before&mdash;No wonder then, that he is not in love. He
<PB N="287" REF="288">
has not had lei&s;ure, I &s;uppo&s;e to attend to the calls of &s;uch an idle pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>You will do me the ju&s;tice to own, that in the round of employments I was engaged in at Selby|hou&s;e, I never knew any-thing of the matter: But indeed there was no Sir Charles Grandi&s;on; fir&s;t to engage my gratitude; and then, my heart. So it is: I mu&s;t not, it &s;eems, <HI>deny</HI> it. If I did, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a child in Love-matters would detect me,"</Q></P>
<P>O MY Lucy! I have been hard &s;et by the&s;e &s;i&s;ters. They have found me out; or rather, let me know, that they long ago found me out. I will tell you all as it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I had been &s;o bu&s;y with my pen, that tho' accu&s;|tomed to be fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ed, where-ver I was, I was now the la&s;t. They entered my dre&s;&s;ing-room arm in arm; and I have &s;ince recollected, that they look|ed as if they had mi&s;chief in their hearts; Mi&s;s Gran|di&s;on e&s;pecially. She had &s;aid, She would play me a trick.</P>
<P>I was in &s;ome little hurry, to be &s;o much behind|hand, when I &s;aw them dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on would do me the honour of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing me, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Jenny, who had but ju&s;t come in to offer her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>She called me charming creature twice, as &s;he was obligingly bu&s;y about me; and the &s;econd time &s;aid, Well may my brother, Lady L. &s;ay what he did of this girl!</P>
<P>With too great eagerne&s;s, What, what, &s;aid I&mdash;I was going to add&mdash;<HI>did he &s;ay?</HI>&mdash;But catching my|&s;elf up, in a tone of le&s;s &s;urprize&mdash;de&s;igning to turn it off&mdash;WHAT <HI>honour you do me, madam, in this your kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance!</HI></P>
<P>Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on leered archly at me; then turning to Lady L. This Harriet of ours, &s;aid &s;he, is more than half a rogue.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="289">
Puni&s;h her then, Charlotte, &s;aid Lady L. You have, tho' with much ado, been brought to &s;peak out your|&s;elf; and &s;o have acquired a kind of right to puni&s;h tho&s;e who affect di&s;gui&s;es to their be&s;t friends.</P>

vouch&s;afed, each, to pre&s;s with her lips the pa&s;&s;ive hand each held.</P>
<P>Be not afraid to &s;peak out, my dear, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. A&s;&s;ure your&s;elf of my love; my true <HI>&s;i&s;terly</HI> love. I once intended to lay the way to the opening of your heart by the di&s;covery of my own, before my brother, as I hoped, could have found me out&mdash;But nothing can be hid&mdash;</P>
<P>Madam! Ladies! &s;aid I, and &s;tood up in a hurry, and, in as great a di&s;compo&s;ure, &s;at down again&mdash;Your brother has not, could not&mdash;I would die be|fore&mdash;</P>

The friends of that Lady have heen very &s;olicitous with us&mdash;And Lady Anne is not aver&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Har.</HI> Dear Ladies! withdrawing the hand that Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on held, and taking out my handker|chief; you &s;ay, you love me!&mdash;Won't you de&s;pi&s;e whom you love?&mdash;I do own&mdash;</P>
<P>There I &s;topt; and dried my eyes.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> What does my Harriet own?&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Har.</HI> O madam, had I a greater opinion of my own merit, than I have rea&s;on to have (and I never had &s;o little an one, as &s;ince I have known you two) I could open to you, without re&s;erve, my whole heart&mdash;But one reque&s;t I have to make you&mdash;You mu&s;t grant it.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="294">
They both in a breath a&s;ked what that was.</P>
<P><HI>Har.</HI> It is, That you will permit your chariot to carry me to town this very afternoon&mdash;And long &s;hall not that <HI>town</HI> hold your Harriet&mdash;Indeed, indeed, La|dies, I cannot now ever look your brother in the face&mdash;And you will al&s;o both de&s;pi&s;e me! I know you will!</P>
<P>Sweet, and as <HI>&s;ea&s;onable</HI> as &s;weet (for I was very much affected) were the a&s;&s;urances they gave m of their continued love.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> We have talked with our brother this morning&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Har.</HI> About me! I hope he has not a notion, that&mdash;There I &s;topt.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> You were mentioned: But we intend not to alarm you farther. We will tell you what pa&s;&s;ed. Lady Anne was our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I was all attention.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> We a&s;ked him if he had any thoughts of marriage? The que&s;tion came in properly enough, from the &s;ubject that preceded it. He was &s;ilent: But &s;ighed, and looked grave [Why did Sir Charles Grandi&s;on &s;igh, Lucy?] We repeated the que&s;tion. You told us, brother, &s;aid I, that you do not intend to re&s;ume the treaty begun by my father for Lady Frances N. What think you of Lady Anne S.? We need not mention to you how con&s;iderable her for|tune is; what an enlargement it would give to your power of doing good; nor what her di&s;po&s;ition and qualities are: Her per&s;on is far from being di&s;agree|able: And &s;he has a great e&s;teem for you.</P>
<P>I think Lady Anne a very agreeable woman, replied he: But if &s;he honours me with a preferable e&s;teem, &s;he gives me regret: becau&s;e it is not in my power to return it.</P>
<P>Not in your <HI>power,</HI> brother?</P>
<P>It is not in my power to return it.</P>
<P>O Lucy! how my heart &s;lutter'd! The ague-&s;ir
<PB N="294" REF="295">
came on again; and I was hot and cold as before, almo&s;t in the &s;ame Moment.</P>
<P>They told me, they would not teaze me further. But there are &s;ubjects, that cannot be touch'd upon without rai&s;ing emotion in the bo&s;om of a per&s;on who hopes, and is uncertain. O the cruelty of &s;u&s;pen&s;e! How every new in&s;tance of it tears in pieces my be|fore almo&s;t bur&s;ting heart!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> My brother went on&mdash;You have often hinted to me at a di&s;tance this &s;ubject. I will not, as I might, an&s;wer your que&s;tion, now &s;o <HI>directly</HI> put, by &s;aying, that it is my wi&s;h to &s;ee you, Charlotte, happily married, before I engage my&s;elf. But, per|haps, I &s;hall be better enabled &s;ome time hence, than I am at pre&s;ent, to return &s;uch an an&s;wer as you may expect from a brother.</P>
<P>Now, my Harriet, we are afraid, by the words, <HI>Not in his power;</HI> and by the hint that he cannot at pre|&s;ent an&s;wer our que&s;tion as he may be enabled to do &s;ome time hence; we are afraid, that &s;ome foreign Lady&mdash;</P>
<P>They had rai&s;ed my hopes; and now, exciting my fears by &s;o well-grounded an apprehen&s;ion, they were obliged for their pains to hold Lady L's &s;alts to my no&s;e. I could not help expo&s;ing my&s;elf, my heart having been weaken'd too by their teazings before. My head dropt on the &s;houlder of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. Tears relieved me.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired their pity. They a&s;&s;ured me of their love; and called upon me, as I valued their friend|&s;hip, to open my whole heart to them.</P>
<P>I pau&s;ed. I he&s;itated. For words did not imme|diately offer them&s;elves. But at la&s;t, I &s;aid, Could I have thought my&s;elf intitled to your&punc; excu&s;e, Ladies, your Harriet, honoured, as &s;he was, from the fir&s;t, with the appellation of <HI>&s;i&s;ter,</HI> would have had no re|&s;erve to <HI>her</HI> &s;i&s;ters: But a ju&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of my wn unworthine&s;s, overcame a temper that I will

&s;ay, is naturally frank and unre&s;erved. Now, howe|ver&mdash;</P>
<P>There I &s;topt and held down my head.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Speak out, my dear,&mdash;What <HI>Now</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr. What</HI> Now, however&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Harriet.</HI> Thus called upon; thus encouraged&mdash;And I lifted up my head as boldly as I could (but it was not, I believe, very boldly) I will own, that the man, who by &s;o &s;ignal an in&s;tance of his bravery and goodne&s;s engaged my gratitude, has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my whole heart.</P>
<P>And then, almo&s;t unknowing what I did, I threw one of my arms, as I &s;at between them, round Lady L's neck, the other round Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's; my glowing face &s;eeking to hide it&s;elf in Lady L.'s bo&s;om.</P>
<P>They both embraced me, and a&s;&s;ured me of their united intere&s;t. They &s;aid, They knew I had al&s;o Dr. Bartlett's high regard: But that they had in vain &s;ought to procure new lights from him; he con&s;tantly, in every-thing that related to their brother, referring him&s;elf to him: And they a&s;&s;ured me, that I had like|wi&s;e the be&s;t wi&s;hes and Intere&s;t of Lord L. to the fulle&s;t extent.</P>
<P>This, Lucy, is &s;ome&mdash;con&s;olation&mdash;mu&s;t I &s;ay?&mdash;&s;ome ea&s;e to my pride, as to what the <HI>family</HI> think of me: But yet, how is that pride mortified, to be thus obliged to rejoice at this &s;trengthening of hope to obtain an intere&s;t in the heart of a man, of who&s;e engagements none of us know any-thing! But if, at la&s;t, it &s;hall prove, that that worthie&s;t of hearts is di&s;engaged; and if I <HI>can</HI> obtain an intere&s;t in it, be pride out of the que&s;tion! The man, as my aunt wrote, is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>I was very earne&s;t to know, &s;ince my eyes had been &s;uch tell-tales, if their brother had any &s;u&s;picion of my regard for him.</P>
<P>They could not, they &s;aid, either from his words or behaviour, gather that he had. He had not been &s;o
<PB N="296" REF="297">
much with me, as they had been. Nor would they wi&s;h that he <HI>&s;hould</HI> &s;u&s;pect me. The be&s;t of men, they &s;aid, loved to have difficulties to conquer. Their brother, generous as he was, was a <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, Lucy, I thought at the time of what he &s;aid at Sir Hargrave Pollexfen's, as recited by the &s;hort|hand writer&mdash;That he would not marry the greate&s;t prince&s;s on earth, if he were not a&s;&s;ured, that &s;he loved him above all the men in it.</P>
<P>I fancy, my dear, that we women, when we love, and are doubtful, &s;uffer a great deal in the apprehen|&s;ion, at one time, of di&s;gu&s;ting the object of our pa&s;&s;ion, by too forward a Love; and, at another, of di&s;|obliging him by too great a re&s;erve. Don't you think &s;o?</P>
<P>The Ladies &s;aid, They were extremely &s;olicitous to &s;ee their brother married. They wi&s;hed it were to me, rather than to any other woman; and kindly add|ed, That I had their hearts, even at the time when Lady Anne, by a kind of previous engagement had their voices.</P>
<P>And then they told me what their brother &s;aid of me, with the hint of which they began this alarming conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>When my brother had let us know, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, that it was not in his power to return a preferable e&s;teem for a like e&s;teem, if Lady Anne ho|noured him with it; I &s;aid&mdash;Had Lady Anne as many advantages to boa&s;t of, as Mi&s;s Byron has, could you then, brother, like Lady Anne?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Byron, replied he, is a charming woman.</P>
<P>Lady L. (&s;lily enough, continued Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on) &s;aid, Mi&s;s Byron is one of the prettie&s;t women I ever beheld. I never &s;aw in any face, youth, and dignity, and &s;weetne&s;s of a&s;pect, &s;o happily blended:</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, Lucy, my vanity may, I hope, revive, &s;o long as I <HI>repeat</HI> only, and repeat ju&s;tly.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Forgive me, Lady L. replied my brother&mdash;But

<P>They made me fine compliments: But they would <HI>indeed</HI> have been fine ones, could they have made them from their brother.</P>
<P>Well, but, Lucy, don't you think, that had Sir Charles Grandi&s;on meant any-thing, he would have expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his &s;i&s;ters in &s;uch high terms, be|fore he had &s;aid <HI>one</HI> very di&s;tingui&s;hing thing to me?

<HEAD>LETTER XXXI. Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI> In Continuation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Wedne&s;day, March 15.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WILL not let you lo&s;e the &s;ub&s;tance of a very agreeable conver&s;ation, which we had la&s;t night after &s;upper. You may be &s;ure I thought it the more agreeable, as Sir Charles was drawn in to bear a con|&s;iderable part in it. It would be impo&s;&s;ible to give you more than pa&s;&s;ages, becau&s;e the &s;ubjects were various, and the tran&s;itions &s;o quick, by one per&s;on a&s;king this que&s;tion, another that, that I could not, were I to try, connect them as I endeavour generally to do.</P>
<P>Of one &s;ubject, Lucy, I particularly <HI>owe</HI> you &s;ome account. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, in her lively way (and lively &s;he was, notwith&s;tanding her trial &s;o lately o|ver) led me into talking of the dete&s;ted ma&s;querade. She put me upon recollecting the giddy &s;cene, which tho&s;e dreadfully intere&s;ting ones that followed it, had made me wi&s;h to blot out of my memory.</P>
<P>I &s;pared you at the time, Harriet, &s;aid &s;he. I a&s;ked you no que&s;tions about the ma&s;querade, when you flew to us fir&s;t, poor frighted bird! with all your gay plumage about you.</P>
<P>I coloured a deep crim&s;on, I believe. What were Sir Charles's fir&s;t thoughts of me, Lucy, in that fan|ta&s;tic, that hated dre&s;s? The &s;imile of the bird too, was <HI>his,</HI> you know; and Charlotte looked very archly.</P>
<P>My dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;pare me &s;till. Let me
<PB N="300" REF="301">
forget, that ever I pre&s;umptuou&s;ly ventured into &s;uch a &s;cene of folly.</P>
<P>Do not call it by har&s;h names, Mi&s;s Byron, &s;aid Sir Charles. We are too much obliged to it.</P>
<P>Can I, Sir Charles, call it by <HI>too</HI> har&s;h a name, when I think, how fatal, in numberle&s;s ways, the event might have proved? But I do not &s;peak only with reference to that. Don't think, my dear Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, that my di&s;like to my&s;elf, and to this fooli&s;h diver&s;ion, &s;prings altogether from what befel <HI>me:</HI> The &s;ame &s;hocking villainy might have been at|tempted by the &s;ame vile man from a more laudable and rea&s;onable diver&s;ion. I had on the &s;pot the &s;ame contempts, the &s;ame di&s;dain of my&s;elf, the di&s;like of all tho&s;e who &s;eemed capable of joy on the light, the fooli&s;h occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>My good Charlotte, &s;aid Sir Charles &s;miling, is le&s;s timorous than her younger &s;i&s;ter. <HI>She</HI> might be per|&s;uaded, I fancy, to venture&mdash;</P>
<P>Under your conduct, Sir Charles. You know, Lady L. and I, who have not yet had an opportunity of this &s;ort, were trying to engage you again&s;t the next &s;ub&s;cription-ball.</P>
<P>Indeed, &s;aid Lady L. our Harriet's di&s;tre&s;s has led me into reflexions I never made before on this kind of diver&s;ion; and I fancy her account of it, will per|fectly &s;atisfy <HI>my</HI> curio&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Proceed, good Mi&s;s Byron. I am as cu|rious as your &s;i&s;ters, to hear what you &s;ay of it. The &s;cene was quite new to you. You probably expected entertainment from it. Forget for a while the acci|dental con&s;equences, and tell us how you were at the time amu&s;ed.</P>
<P>Amu&s;ed! Sir Charles!&mdash;Indeed I had no opinion of the diver&s;ion, even before I went. I knew I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e it. I knew I &s;hould often wi&s;h my&s;elf at home before the evening were over. And &s;o indeed I did. I whi&s;pered my cou&s;in Reeves more than once, O ma|dam!

<P>Yet you &s;ee, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, however Lady L. is, or &s;eems to be, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly informed, there were <HI>two,</HI> who would gladly have been there: The more, you may be &s;ure, for its having been a diver|&s;ion prohibited to us, at our fir&s;t coming to town.

I was di&s;gu&s;ted at the freedoms taken with me, tho' but the common freedoms of the place, by per&s;ons who &s;ingled me from the throng, hurried me round the rooms, and engaged me in fifty idle conver&s;ations; and to whom, by the pri|vilege of the place, I was obliged to be bold, pert, &s;aucy, and to aim at repartee and &s;martne&s;s; the cur|rent wit of that witle&s;s place. They once got me into a country-dance. No prude could come, or if &s;he came, could be a prude, there.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Were you not plea&s;ed, Mi&s;s Byron, with the fir&s;t coup d'oeil of that gay apartment?</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="303">
A momentary plea&s;ure: but when I came to re|flect, the bright light, &s;triking on my tin&s;el dre&s;s, made me &s;eem to my&s;elf the more con&s;picuous fool. Let me be kept in countenance as I might, by &s;cores of &s;till more ridiculous figures, what, thought I, are other people's follies to me?

<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> It is contrary to decorum for &s;uch &s;hock|ing characters to be a&s;&s;umed at all: But might it not, Sir Charles, &s;o regulated, be a rational and an almo&s;t in&s;tructive entertainment?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> You would &s;carcely be able, my dear &s;i&s;ter, to collect eight or nine hundred people, all wits, and all ob&s;ervant of decorum. And if you could, does not the example reach down to tho&s;e who are capa|ble of taking only the bad and dangerous part of a diver&s;ion; which you may &s;ee by every common news-paper is become dreadfully general?</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> Well, Sir Charles, and why &s;hould not the poor devils in <HI>low life</HI> divert them&s;elves as well as their betters? For my part, I rejoice when I &s;ee ad|verti&s;ed
<PB N="303" REF="304">
an eighteen-penny ma&s;querade, for all the pretty 'prentice &s;ouls, who will that evening be Ar|cadian Shepherde&s;&s;es, Godde&s;&s;es, and Queens.</P>
<P>I blu&s;hed at the word <HI>Arcadian;</HI> yet Mr. Grandi|&s;on did not &s;eem to have my ma&s;querade dre&s;s in his thoughts.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> What low profligate &s;cenes could&s;t thou expatiate upon, good man! if thou wert in proper company! I warrant tho&s;e Godde&s;&s;es have not want|ed an adorer in our cou&s;in Everard.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> Dear Mi&s;s Charlotte, take care! I pro|te&s;t, you begin to talk with the &s;pite of an old maid.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> There, brother! Do you hear the wretch? Will not you, knight-errand like, defend the cau&s;e of a whole cla&s;s of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed dam&s;els, with our good York&s;hire aunt at the head of them?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Tho&s;e general prejudices and a&s;per&s;ions, Charlotte, are indeed unju&s;t and cruel. Yet I am for having every-body marry. Bachelors, cou&s;in Everard, and maids, when long &s;ingle, are looked upon as hou&s;es long empty, which no-body cares to take. As the hou&s;es in time, by long di&s;u&s;e, will be thought by the vulgar haunted by evil &s;pirits, &s;o will the other, by the <HI>many,</HI> be thought po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by no good ones.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ition was &s;ome-how made from hence to the equitablene&s;s that ought to be in our judgements of one another. We mu&s;t in the&s;e ca&s;es, &s;aid Sir Charles, throw merit in one &s;cale, demerit in the o|ther; and if the former weigh down the latter, we mu&s;t in charity pronounce to the per&s;on's advantage. So it is humbly hoped we &s;hall finally be judged our|&s;elves: For who is faultle&s;s?</P>
<P>Yet, &s;aid he, for my own part, that I may not be wanting to prudence, I have &s;ometimes where the merit is not very &s;triking, allowed per&s;ons, at fir&s;t ac|quaintance, a &s;hort lea&s;e only in my good opinion; &s;ome for three, &s;ome for &s;ix, &s;ome for nine, others for twelve months, renewable or not, as they an&s;wer
<PB N="304" REF="305">
expectation. And by this meane I leave it to every one to make his own character with me; I pre&s;erve my charity, and my complacency; and enter directly, with frankne&s;s, into conver&s;ation with him; and ge|nerally continue that freedom to the end of the re|&s;pective per&s;on's lea&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> I wonder how many of your lea&s;es, bro|ther, have been granted to Ladies?</P>
<P><HI>Sir Ch.</HI> Many, Charlotte, of the friendly &s;ort: But the kind you archly mean, are out of the que&s;tion at pre&s;ent. We were talking of e&s;teem.</P>
<P>They in&s;en&s;ibly led the conver&s;ation to Love and Court&s;hip; and he &s;aid [What do you think he &s;aid, Lucy?] That he &s;hould not, perhaps, were he in Love, be over-forward to declare his pa&s;&s;ion by words; but rather &s;hew it by his a&s;&s;iduities and veneration, unle&s;s he &s;aw, that the &s;u&s;pen&s;e was painful to the ob|ject; and in this ca&s;e it would be equally mean and in&s;olent not to break &s;ilence, and put him&s;elf in the power of her, who&s;e honour and delicacy ought to be dearer to him than his own.</P>
<P>What &s;ay you to this, Lucy?</P>
<P>Some think, proceeded he, that the days of court|&s;hip are the happie&s;t days of life. But the man, who, as a Lover, thinks &s;o, is not to be forgiven. Yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that <HI>hope</HI> gives an ardour which &s;ub&s;ides in certainty.</P>
<P>Being called upon by Lord L. to be more explicit:</P>
<P>I am not endeavouring, &s;aid he, to &s;et up my par|ticular humour for a general rule. For my own &s;ake, I would not, by a too early declaration, drive a Lady into re&s;erves; &s;ince that would be to rob my&s;elf of tho&s;e innocent freedoms, and of that complacency, to which an honourable Lover might think him&s;elf entitled; and which might help him (Don't be af|frighted, Ladies!) to develop the plaits and folds of the female heart.</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="306">
This developement &s;tuck with us women a little. We talked of it afterwards. And Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on then &s;aid, It was well her cou&s;in Everard &s;aid not that. And <HI>he</HI> an&s;wered, Sir Charles may with more &s;afety <HI>&s;teal an hor&s;e,</HI> than I <HI>look over the hedge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Ay, cou&s;in Grandi&s;on, that is becau&s;e you are a Rake. A name, believe me, of at lea&s;t as much reproach, as that of an Old Maid.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Gr.</HI> A&s;per&s;ing a whole cla&s;s at once, Mi&s;s Charlotte! 'Tis contrary to your own maxim; And a cla&s;s too (this of the Rakes) that many a generous|&s;pirited girl choo&s;es out of, when &s;he would di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf and her fortune.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> How malapert this Everard!</P>
<P>What Sir Charles <HI>next</HI> &s;aid, made him own the character more decently by his blu&s;hes.</P>
<P>The woman who choo&s;es a Rake, &s;aid he, does not con&s;ider, that all the &s;prightly airs for which &s;he preferred him to a better man, either vani&s;h in ma|trimony, or are &s;hewn to others, to her mortal di&s;quiet. The agreeable will be carried abroad: The di&s;agree|able will be brought home. If he reform (and yet bad habits are very difficult to &s;hake off) he will pro|bably, from the reflexions on his pa&s;t guilty life, be an un&s;ociable companion, &s;hould deep and true con|trition have laid hold on him: If not, what has &s;he cho&s;en? He married not from hone&s;t principles: A Rake de&s;pi&s;es matrimony: If &s;till a Rake, what hold will &s;he have of him? A Rake in <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> is not a Rake in <HI>Love.</HI> Such a one can &s;eldom be in Love: From a laudable pa&s;&s;ion he cannot. He has no deli|cacy. His Love de&s;erves a vile name: And if &s;o, it will be &s;trange, if in his eyes a common woman ex|cel not his mode&s;t wife,</P>
<P>What he &s;aid, was openly approved by the Gentle|men: tacitly by the Ladies.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject changing to marriages of per&s;ons of unequal years; I knew, &s;aid Lord L. a woman of cha|racter,
<PB N="306" REF="307">
and not reckoned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">, who married at twenty a man of more than fif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">y in hopes of bu|rying him; but who lived with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eward of twenty years; and then dying, &s;he is now in treaty with a young Rake of twenty-two. She is rich! and, poor woman! hopes to be happy. Pity, Sir Charles, &s;he could not &s;ee the picture you have been dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ng.</P>
<P>Retribution, &s;aid Sir Charles, will frequently take its cour&s;e. The Lady, keeping in view one &s;teady purpo&s;e; which was, That &s;he would marry a young man, whenever death removed the old one, forgot, when &s;he lo&s;t her hu&s;band, that &s;he had been growing older for the la&s;t twenty years; and will now very probably be the de&s;pi&s;ed mate to the young hu&s;band, that her late hu&s;band was to her. Thirty years hence, the now young man will perhaps fall into the error of his predece&s;&s;or, if he outlive the wife he is going to take, and be puni&s;hed in the &s;ame way. The&s;e are what may be called puni&s;hments in kind. The vio|lators of the &s;ocial duties are frequently puni&s;hed by the &s;ucce&s;s of their own wi&s;hes. Don't you think, my Lord, that it is &s;uitable to the divine benignity, as well as ju&s;tice, to lend its &s;anctions and puni&s;hments in aid of tho&s;e duties which bind man to man?</P>
<P>Lord L. &s;aid &s;ome very good things. Your Harriet was not a mute: But you know, that my point is, to let you into the character and &s;entiments of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on: And whenever I can do them tolerable ju&s;tice, I &s;hall keep to that point. You will promi&s;e for me, you &s;ay, Lucy&mdash;I know you will.</P>
<P>But one might have expected that Dr. Bartlett would have &s;aid more than he did, on &s;ome of the &s;ubjects: Yet Mr. Grandi&s;on, and he, and Mi&s;s Emily, were almo&s;t equally, and attentively, &s;ilent, till the la&s;t &s;cene: And then the Doctor &s;aid, I mu&s;t &s;hew you a little tran&s;lation of Mi&s;s Emily's from the Italian. She blu&s;hed, and looked as if &s;he knew not whether &s;he &s;hould &s;tay or go. I &s;hall be glad to &s;ee
<PB N="307" REF="308">
any-thing of my Emily's, &s;aid Sir Charles. I know &s;he is a mi&s;tre&s;s of that language, and elegant in her own. Pray, my dear, (to her) let us be obliged, if it will not pain you.</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed, and bowed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t fir&s;t tell you, &s;aid the Doctor, that I was the occa&s;ion of her choo&s;ing &s;o grave a &s;ubject, as you will find that of the &s;onnet from which hers is taken.</P>
<P>A &s;onnet! &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on. My dear little POETESS, you mu&s;t &s;et it, and &s;ing it to us.</P>
<P>No indeed, madam, &s;aid Mi&s;s Jervois, blu&s;hing &s;till more, Dr. Bartlett would by no means have me a <HI>Poete&s;s,</HI> I am &s;ure: And did you not, dear madam, &s;peak that word, as if you meant to call me a name?</P>
<P>I think &s;he did, my dear, &s;aid Sir Charles: Nor would I have had my Emily di&s;tingui&s;hed by any name, but that of a di&s;creet, an ingenious, and an amiable young woman. The title of <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Poete&s;s,</HI> has been di&s;graced too often by Sappho's and Corrinna's an|cient and modern. Was not this in your head, &s;i&s;ter? But do not be di&s;turbed, my Emily [the poor girl's eyes gli&s;tened]. I mean no check to liveline&s;s and mo|de&s;t ingenuity. The ea&s;y productions of a fine fancy, not made the bu&s;ine&s;s of life, or its boa&s;t, confer no denomination that is di&s;graceful, but very much the contrary.</P>
<P>I am very glad, for all <HI>that,</HI> &s;aid Mi&s;s Jervois, that my little tran&s;lation is in plain pro&s;e: Had it not, I &s;hould have been very much afraid to have it &s;een.</P>
<P>Even in that ca&s;e, you need not to have been afraid, my dear Mi&s;s Jervois, &s;aid the good Dr. Bartlett: Sir Charles is an admirer of good poetry: And Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on would have recollected the Philomelas, the Orinadas, and other excellent names among her own &s;ex, who&s;e fine genius does it honour.</P>
<P>Your diffidence and &s;weet humility, my dear Emily, &s;aid Lady L. would, in you, make the mo&s;t envied accompli&s;hments amiable.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXII. Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>GRANDISON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday March 17.</HI></DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Charlotte,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE already &s;een Captain Ander&s;on. Richard Saunder, whom I &s;ent with your Letter&punc; as &s;oon as I came to town, found him at his lodgings near Whitehall. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, on re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ding it be|fore the &s;ervant, with <HI>indiferent</HI> warmth. I would not make minute enquiries after his words, becau&s;e I intended an amicable meeting with him.</P>
<P>We met at four ye&s;terday afternoon, at the Cocoa-tree in Pall-mall: Lieut. Col. Mackenzie, and Major Dillon, two of his frienda, with whom I had no ac|quaintance, were with him. Ths Captain and I withdrew to a private room. The two gentlemen enter'd it with us.</P>
<P>You will on this occa&s;ion, I know, expect me to be particular: Yet mu&s;t allow, that I had no good cau&s;e to manage; &s;ince tho&s;e points that had mo&s;t weight (and which were the ground of your objecti|ons to him, when you &s;aw him in a near light) could not be pleaded without affronting him; and if they were, would hardly meet with his allow|ance; and could therefore have no force in the argument.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="311">
On the two gentlemen entering the room with us, without apology or objection, I a&s;k'd the Captain, If they were acquainted with the affair we met upon? He &s;aid, They were his dear and in&s;eparable friends, and knew every &s;ecret of his heart. Perhaps in this ca&s;e, Captain Ander&s;on, returned I, it were as well they did not.</P>
<P>We are men of honour, Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, &s;aid the Major bri&s;kly.</P>
<P>I don't doubt it, Sir. But where the delicacy of a Lady is concern'd, the hearts of the principals &s;hould be the whole world to each other. But what is done, is done. I am ready to enter upon the affair before the&s;e gentlemen, if you choo&s;e it, Captain.</P>
<P>You will find us to be gentlemen, Sir Charles, &s;aid the Colonel.</P>
<P>The Captain then began, with warmth, his own &s;tory: Indeed he told it very well. I was plea&s;ed, for my <HI>&s;i&s;ter's &s;ake</HI> (pardon me, Charlotte) that he did. He is not contemptible, either in per&s;on or un|der&s;tanding. He may be &s;aid, perhaps, to be an illi|terate, but he is not an ignorant man; tho' not the per&s;on whom the friends of Charlotte Grandi&s;on would think worthy of the fir&s;t place in her heart.</P>
<P>After he had told his &s;tory (which I need not repeat to you) he in&s;i&s;ted upon your promi&s;e. And his two friends declared in his favour, with airs, each man, a little too peremptory. I told them &s;o; and that they mu&s;t do me the ju&s;tice to con&s;ider me as a man of &s;ome &s;pirit, as well as them&s;elves. I came hither with a friendly intention, gentlemen &s;aid I. I do not love to follow the lead of ha&s;ty &s;pirits. But if you expect to carry any point with me, it mu&s;t not be either by rai&s;ed voices, or heightened complexions.</P>
<P>Their features were all at once changed. And they &s;aid, they meant not to be warm.</P>
<P>I told the Captain, That I would not enter into a minute defence of the Lady, tho' my &s;i&s;ter; I owned,
<PB N="311" REF="312">
that there had appeared a precipitation in her conduct. Her treatment at home, as &s;he aprehended, was not an&s;werable to her merits. She was young, and knew nothing of the world. Young Ladies were often &s;truck by appearances. You, Captain Ander&s;on, &s;aid I, have advantages in per&s;on and manner, that might obtain for you a young Lady's attention. And as &s;he believed her&s;elf circum&s;tanced in her family, I wonder not that &s;he lent an air to the addre&s;s of a gallant man; who&s;e command in that neighbourhood, and, I doubt not, who&s;e behaviour in that com|mand, added to his con&s;equence. But I take it for granted, Sir, that you met with difficulties from her, when &s;he came to reflect upon the di&s;reputation of a young woman's carrying on clande&s;tinely a corre&s;pond|ence with a man, of who&s;e addre&s;s her father, then living, was not likely to approve. There was none of that violent pa&s;&s;ion on either &s;ide, that precludes rea|&s;on, di&s;cretion, duty. It is no wonder then, that a woman of Charlotte Grandi&s;on's known good &s;en&s;e, &s;hould reflect, &s;hould con&s;ider: And perhaps the le&s;s, that you &s;hould therefore &s;eek to engage her by pro|mi&s;e. But what <HI>was</HI> the promi&s;e? It was not the promi&s;e that, it &s;eems, you &s;ought to engage her to make; To be ab&s;olutely yours, and no other man's: But it was, That &s;he would not marry any other man without your con&s;ent, while you remained &s;ingle. An unrea&s;onable promi&s;e, however, I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, either to be propo&s;ed, or &s;ubmitted to.</P>
<P><HI>Sir!</HI> &s;aid the Captain; and looked the Soldier.</P>
<P>I repeated what I la&s;t &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Sir!</HI> again &s;aid the Captain; and looked upon his friends, who pointed each his head at the other, and at him, by turns&mdash;as if they had &s;aid, Very free language!</P>
<P>For, Sir, proceeded I, did it not give room to think, that you had either &s;ome doubts of your own merit with the Lady, or of her affection and &s;teadi|ne&s;s
<PB N="312" REF="313">
And in either ca&s;e, ought it to have been pro|po&s;ed? ought it to have been made? For my part, I &s;hould di&s;dain to think of any woman for a wife who gave me rea&s;on to imagine, that &s;he was likely to ba|lance a moment, as to her choice of me, or any other man.</P>
<P>Something in that! &s;aid the Colonel.</P>
<P>As you explain your&s;elf, Sir Charles, &s;aid the Major&mdash;</P>
<P>The Captain, however, &s;at &s;welling. He was not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>Your motive, we are not to que&s;tion, Captain, was Love. Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on is a young woman whom any man may love. By the way, where a man is a&s;&s;ured of a return in Love, there is no occa&s;ion for a pro|mi&s;e. But a promi&s;e <HI>was</HI> made. My &s;i&s;ter is a wo|man of honour. She thinks her&s;elf bound by it; and &s;he is content to lead a &s;ingle life to the end of it, if you will not acquit her of this promi&s;e. Yet &s;he leaves, and at the <HI>time</HI> did leave, <HI>you</HI> free. You will have the ju&s;tice, Sir, to allow, that there is genero&s;ity in her conduct to you, which remains for you to &s;hew to her, &s;ince a promi&s;e &s;hould not be made but on equal terms. Would you hold her to it, and be not held your&s;elf? She de&s;ires not to hold you. Let me tell you, Captain, that if I had been in your &s;ituation, and had been able to <HI>prevail upon my&s;elf</HI> to endeavour to bring a Lady to make me &s;uch a promi&s;e, I &s;hould have doubted her love of me, had &s;he not &s;ought to bind me to her by an equal tie. What! &s;hould I have &s;aid to my&s;elf, Is this Lady dearer to <HI>me</HI> than all the women upon earth? Do I &s;eek to bind her to me by a &s;olemn promi&s;e, which &s;hall give me a power over <HI>her?</HI> And has &s;he &s;o little regard for me, as not to va|lue, whether I marry any other woman?</P>
<P>The Gentlemen looked upon one another; but were &s;ilent. I proceeded.</P>
<P>Le us &s;et this matter in its true light. Here is a
<PB N="313" REF="314">
young woman, who had &s;uffered her&s;elf to be embar|ra&s;&s;ed in a treaty, that her whole heart, &s;he a&s;&s;ures me, was never in, <HI>This was her fault.</HI> But know we not how inextricable are the entanglements of <HI>Love,</HI> as it is called, when young women are brought to enter into corre&s;pondence with men? Our Sex have oppor|tunities of knowing the world, which the other have not. Experience, gentlemen, engaging with inexpe|rience, and perhaps to the difference of twice the number of years [Sir! &s;aid the Captain!] the com|bat mu&s;t be too unequal. How artfully do men endea|vour to draw in the women whom they think it worth their while to pur&s;ue!&mdash;But would any man here wi&s;h to marry a woman, who declares that &s;he was in&s;en|&s;ibly drawn in beyond her purpo&s;e? Who &s;hewed, when &s;he refu&s;ed to promi&s;e that &s;he would be his, in preference to all other men, that &s;he did not love him above all other men? Who, when &s;he was pre|vailed on to fetter her&s;elf, made him not of con&s;e|quence enough to her&s;elf to bind <HI>him?</HI> And, in a word, who has long ago declared to him, and &s;teadi|ly per&s;i&s;ts in the declaration, That &s;he <HI>never</HI> will be his?&mdash;You &s;eem, gentlemen, to be men of &s;pirit. Would you wi&s;h to marry the fir&s;t woman on earth on the&s;e terms, if you <HI>could</HI> obtain her?&mdash;which, how|ever, is not the ca&s;e; &s;ince Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on's promi&s;e extends not &s;o far as to oblige her to marry Captain Ander&s;on.</P>
<P>The Captain did not, he told me, like &s;ome part of what I had &s;aid, and &s;till le&s;s &s;ome of the words I had u&s;ed;&mdash;And &s;eemed to be di&s;po&s;ing his features to take a livelier turn than became the occa&s;ion. I interrupted him therefore: I meet you not, Captain, &s;aid I, either to hear, or to obviate, cavils upon words. When I have told you, that I came with an amicable inten|tion, I expect to be believed. I intend not offence. But let us be <HI>men.</HI> I am perhaps a younger man by ten years, than any one pre&s;ent; but I have &s;een the
<PB N="314" REF="315">
world, as much as any man of my age; and know what is due to the character of a Gentleman, whe|ther it be captain Ander&s;on's, or my own: And ex|pect not wilful mi&s;con&s;tructions.</P>
<P>All I mean is, Sir, &s;aid the Captain, that I will not be treated contemptuou&s;ly, no, not even by the brother of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>The brother of Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, Sir, is not ac|cu&s;tomed to treat any man contemptuou&s;ly. Don't treat your&s;elf &s;o, and you are &s;afe from unworthy treatment from me. Let me add, Sir, that I permit every man to &s;ix his character with me, as he plea&s;es. I will venture to &s;ay, I have a large charity; but I extend it not to tamene&s;s: But yet will always al|low a third per&s;on to decide upon the ju&s;tice of my in|tentions and actions.</P>
<P>The Captain &s;aid, That he a&s;cribed a great deal of my &s;i&s;ter's <HI>po&s;itivene&s;s in her denial of him</HI> (tho&s;e were his words) to the time of my arrival in <HI>England;</HI> and he doubted not, that I had encouraged the propo&s;als, either of Sir Walter Watkyns, or of Lord G. becau&s;e of their quality and fortunes: And hence his difficul|ties were encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>And then up he ro&s;e, &s;lapt one hand upon the table, put the other on his &s;word, and was going to &s;ay &s;ome very fierce things, prefacing them with damning his blood, when I &s;tood up: Hold, Captain; be calm, if po&s;&s;ible&mdash;Hear from me the naked truth; I will|make you a fair repre&s;entation; and, when I have done, do you re&s;ume, if you think it nece&s;&s;ary, that angry air you got up with, and &s;ee what you'll make of it.</P>
<P>His friends interpo&s;ed. He &s;at down, half out of breath with anger. His &s;welled features went down by degrees.</P>
<P>The truth of the matter is &s;trictly and briefly this.</P>
<P>All my &s;i&s;ter's difficulties (which, perhaps, were greater in apprehen&s;ion than in fact) ended with my
<PB N="315" REF="316">
father's life. I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s, on my arrival, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to a&s;certain my &s;i&s;ter's fortunes. Lord. L. married&punc; the elder. The two gentlemen you have mentioned, made their addre&s;&s;es to the younger. I knew nothing of you, Captain Ander&s;on. My &s;i&s;ter had wholly kept the affair between you and her, in her own brea&s;t. She had not revealed it, even to her &s;i&s;ter. The rea&s;on &s;he gives, and to which you, Sir, could be no &s;tranger, was, That &s;he was determined never to be yours. The &s;ubject requires explicitne&s;s, Cap|tain Ander&s;on: And I am not accu&s;tomed to palliate, whenever it does. She hoped to prevail upon you to leave her as generou&s;ly free, as &s;he had left you. I do a&s;&s;ure you, upon my honour, that &s;he favours not either of the gentlemen. I know not the man &s;he <HI>does</HI> favour. It is I, her brother, not her&s;elf, that am &s;o|licitous for her marrying. And, upon the indifference &s;he expre&s;&s;ed to change her condition, on terms to which no objection could be made, I &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he mu&s;t have a &s;ecret preference to &s;ome other man. I was afterwards informed, that letters had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween her and you, by a Lady, who had it from a Gentleman of your acquaintance. You have &s;hewn me, Sir, by the pre&s;ence of the&s;e Gentlemen, that you were not &s;o careful of the &s;ecret, as my &s;i&s;ter had been.</P>
<P>I charged my &s;i&s;ter, upon this di&s;covery, with re|&s;erve to me: But offered her my &s;ervice in her own way; a&s;&s;uring her, that if her heart were engaged, the want of quality, title, and fortune, &s;hould not be of weight with me; and that whom&s;oever &s;he ac|cepted for her hu&s;band, him would I receive for my brother.</P>
<P>The colonel and the Major extravagantly applaud|ed a behaviour on this occa&s;ion, which de&s;erved no more than a common approbation&punc;</P>
<P>She &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured me, proceeded I, that altho' &s;he held her&s;elf bound by the promi&s;e which youth,
<PB N="316" REF="317">
inexperience, and &s;olicitation, had drawn her in to make, &s;he re&s;olved to perform it by a perpetual &s;ingle life, if it were in&s;i&s;ted upon. And thus, Sir, you &s;ee, that it depends upon you to keep Charlotte Grandi&s;on a &s;ingle woman, till you marry &s;ome other Lady (A power let me tell you, that no man ought to &s;eek to obtain over any young woman) or, generou&s;ly to ac|quit her of it, and leave her as free as &s;he has left you.&mdash;And now, gentlemen (to the Major and Colonel) if you come hither not &s;o much parties as judges, I leave this matter upon your con&s;ideration; and will with|draw for a few moments.</P>
<P>I left every mouth ready to bur&s;t into words; and walked into the public room. There I met with Co|lonel Martin, whom I had &s;een abroad: and who had ju&s;t a&s;ked after Major Dillon. He, to my great &s;urprize, took notice to me of the bu&s;ine&s;s that brought me thither.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my &s;i&s;ter, the con&s;equences you were of to Captain Ander&s;on. He had not been able to forbear boa&s;ting of the honour which a daughter of Sir Tho|mas Grandi&s;on had done him, and of his enlarged pro&s;pects, by her intere&s;t. Dear Charlotte&mdash;How unhappy was the man, that your pride &s;hould make you think your&s;elf concern'd to keep &s;ecret an affair that he thought a glory to him to make known to ma|ny! For we &s;ee (&s;hall I not &s;ay, to the advantage of this gentleman's character) that he has many <HI>dear</HI> and <HI>in&s;eparable friends,</HI> from whom he <HI>concealed not any &s;ecret of his heart.</HI></P>
<P>Colonel Mackenzie came out &s;oon after, and we withdrew to the corner of the room. He talked a great deal of the &s;trength of the captain's pa&s;&s;ion; of the hopes he had conceived of making his fortune, thro' the intere&s;t of a family to which he imputed con&s;ideration: He made me a great many compli|ments. He talk'd of the great detriment this long|&s;u&s;pended affair had been to his friend; and told me,
<PB N="317" REF="318">
with a grave countenance, that the Captain was grown as many years older, as it had been in hand; and was ready to rate very highly &s;o much time lo&s;t in the prime of life. In &s;hort, he a&s;cribed to the Captain the views and the di&s;appointments of a mili|tary fortune-hunter too plainly for his honour in my eye; had I been di&s;po&s;ed to take <HI>proper</HI> notice of the meaning of what he &s;aid.</P>
<P>After having heard him out, I de&s;ired the Colonel to let me know what all this meant, and what were the Captain's expectations.</P>
<P>He paraded on again, a long time; and a&s;ked me, at la&s;t, If there were no hopes that the Lady&mdash;</P>
<P>None at all, interrupted I. She ha &s;teadily de|clared as much. Charlotte Grandi&s;on is a woman of fine &s;en&s;e. She had great qualities. She has in&s;upe|rable objections to the Captain, which are founded on a more perfect knowledge of the man, and of her own heart, than &s;he could have at fir&s;t. It is not my in|tention to depreciate him with his friend: I &s;hall not, therefore, enter into particulars. Let me know, Co|lonel, what the gentleman pretends to. He is pa&s;|&s;ionate, I &s;ee: I am not a tame man. But God for|bid, that Captain Ander&s;on, who hoped to be bene|fited by an alliance with the daughter of Sir Thomas Grandi&s;on, &s;hould receive hurt, or hard treatment, from her brother!</P>
<P>Here Colonel Martin, who had heard &s;omething of what was &s;aid, de&s;ired to &s;peak with Colonel Macken|zie. They were not &s;o di&s;tant, but my ear unavoid|ably caught part of their &s;ubject. Colonel Martin ex|patiated, in a very high manner, on my character, when I was abroad. He imputed bravery to me (a great article among military men, and with you Ladies) and I know not how many good qualities&mdash;And Colonel Mackenzie took him in with him to the other two gentlemen: Where, I &s;uppo&s;e, every|thing that had pa&s;&s;ed was repeated.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="319">
After a while, I was de&s;ired by Colonel Martin. in the name of the gentlemen, to walk in; he him&s;elf &s;itting down in the public room.</P>
<P>They received me with re&s;pect. I was obliged to hear and &s;ay a great many things, that I had &s;aid and heard before: But at la&s;t two propo&s;als were made me; either of which, they &s;aid, if complied with, would be taken as laying the Captain under very high obligation.</P>
<P>Poor man! I had compa&s;&s;ion for him, and clo&s;ed with one of them; declining the other for a rea&s;on which I did not give to them. To &s;ay truth, Char|lotte, I did not choo&s;e to promi&s;e my <HI>intere&s;t</HI> in behalf of a man, of who&s;e merit I was not a&s;&s;ured, had I been able to challenge any, as perhaps I might by Lord W.'s means; who &s;tands well with proper per&s;ons. A man ought to think him&s;elf, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ac|countable for <HI>warm</HI> recommendations; e&s;pecially where the public is concerned: And could I give my promi&s;e, and be cool as to the performance? And I &s;hould think my&s;elf al&s;o an&s;werable to a worthy man, and to every one connected with him, if I were a means of lifting one le&s;s worthy over his head. I cho&s;e therefore to do that &s;ervice to him, for which I am re&s;pon&s;ible only to <HI>my&s;elf.</HI> After I have &s;aid this, my &s;i&s;ter mu&s;t a&s;k me no que&s;tions,</P>
<P>I gave a rough draught, at the Captain's reque&s;t, of the manner in which I would have relea&s;es drawn. Colonel Martin was de&s;ired to walk in. And all the gentlemen promi&s;ed to bury in &s;ilence and all that had ever come to their knowlege, of what had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween Charlotte Grandi&s;on, and Captain Ander&s;on.</P>
<P>Let not the mentioning to you the&s;e mea&s;ures, hurt you, my &s;i&s;ter. Many young Ladies of &s;en&s;e and fa|mily have been drawn into &s;till greater inconveni|encies than you have &s;uffered. Per&s;ons of eminent abilities (I have a very high opinion of my Charlotte's) &s;eldom err in <HI>&s;mall</HI> points. Mo&s;t young women who
<PB N="319" REF="320">
begin a corre&s;pondence with our de&s;igning Sex, think they can &s;top when they will. But it is not &s;o. We, and the dark &s;pirit that &s;ets us at work, which we &s;ometimes mi&s;-call Love, will not permit you to do &s;o. Men and Women are Devils to one another. They need no other tempter.</P>
<P>All will be completed to morrow; and your writ|ten promi&s;e, of con&s;equence, given up. I congratu|late my &s;i&s;ter on the happy conclu&s;ion of this affair. You are now your own mi&s;tre&s;s, and free to choo&s;e for your&s;elf. I &s;hould never forgive my&s;elf, were I, who have been the means of freeing you from one controul, to endeavour to lay you under another. Think not either of Sir Walter or of Lord G. if your heart declare not in favour of either. You have &s;ometimes thought me <HI>carne&s;t</HI> in behalf of Lord G. But I have never &s;poken in his favour, but when you have put me upon an&s;wering objections to him, which I have thought in&s;ufficient: And indeed, Charlotte, &s;ome of your objections have been &s;o &s;light, that I was ready to believe, you put them for the plea&s;ure of having them an&s;wered.</P>
<P>My Charlotte need not doubt of admirers, where&mdash;ever &s;he &s;ets her foot, And I repeat, that whoever be the man &s;he inclines to favour, &s;he may depend upon the approbation and good offices of</P>

<P>I SEND you inclo&s;ed (to be returned by the fir&s;t opportunity) Sir Charles's Letter to his &s;i&s;ter, ac|quainting her with the happy conclu&s;ion of the affair between Captain Ander&s;on and her. Her brother, as
<PB N="320" REF="321">
you will &s;ee&punc; acquits her not of precipitation. If he did, it would have been an impeachment of this ju&s;tice, O the dear Charlotte! how her pride is piqued at the meanne&s;s of the man! But no more of this &s;ubject, as the Letter is before you.</P>
<P>And now, my dear and honoured friends, let me return you a thou&s;and thanks for the great pacquet of my Letters, ju&s;t &s;ent me, with a mo&s;t indulgent one from my aunt, and another from my uncle.</P>
<P>I have already put into the two Ladies, and my Lord's, without re&s;erve, all the Letters that reach to the ma&s;querade affair, from the time of my &s;etting out for London, and when they have heard tho&s;e, I have promi&s;ed them more. This confidence has greatly obliged them; and they are employed, with no &s;mall earne&s;tne&s;s, in peru&s;ing them.</P>
<P>This gives me an opportunity of pur&s;uing my own devices&mdash;And what, be&s;ides &s;cribling, do you think one of them is&mdash;A kind of per&s;ecution of Dr. Bartlett; by which, however, I &s;u&s;pect, that I my&s;elf am the greate&s;t &s;ufferer. He is an excellent man; and I make no difficulty of going to him in his clo&s;et; en|couraged by his a&s;&s;urances of welcome.</P>
<P>Let me &s;top to &s;ay, my Lucy, that when I approach this good man in his retirement, &s;urrounded by his books, his table generally covered with tho&s;e on pious &s;ubjects, I, in my heart, congratulate the &s;aint, and inheritor of future glory; and in that great view am the more de&s;irous to cultivate his friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>And what do you think is our &s;ubject? Sir Charles, I &s;uppo&s;e, you gue&s;s&mdash;And &s;o it is, either in the mid|dle or latter end of the few conver&s;ations we have yet had time to hold: But, I do a&s;&s;ure you, we begin with the &s;ublime&s;t; tho' I mu&s;t &s;ay, to my &s;hame, that it has not &s;o much of my heart, at pre&s;ent, as once it had, and I hope again it will one day have&mdash;The great and glorious truths of Chri&s;tianity, are this &s;ubject; which <HI>yet,</HI> from this good Dr. Bartlett,
<PB N="321" REF="322">
warms my heart, as often as he enters into it. But this very &s;ubject, &s;ublime as it is, brings on the other, as of con&s;equence: For Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, with|out making an o&s;tentatious preten&s;ion to religion, is the very Chri&s;tian in practice, that the&s;e doctrines teach a man to be. Mu&s;t not then the doctrines in|troduce the mention of a man who endeavours hum|bly to imitate the Divine example? It was upon good grounds he once &s;aid, That as he mu&s;t one day die, it was matter of no moment to <HI>him,</HI> whether it were to-morrow, or forty years hence.</P>
<P>The Ladies had referred me to the Doctor him&s;elf for a more &s;atisfactory account than they had given me, how Sir Charles and he fir&s;t came acquainted. I told him &s;o, and a&s;ked his indulgence to me in this enquiry.</P>
<P>He took it kindly. He had, he &s;aid, the hi&s;tory of it written down. His nephew, whom he often employs as his amanuen&s;is, &s;hould make me out, from that little hi&s;tory an account of it, which I might &s;hew, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, to &s;uch of my &s;elect friends, as I entru&s;ted with the knowlege of my own heart.</P>
<P>I &s;hall impatiently expect the ab&s;tract of this little hi&s;tory; and the more, as the Doctor tells me, there will be included &s;ome particulars of Sir Charles's be|haviour abroad in his younger life, and of Mr. Beau|champ, whom the Doctor &s;peaks of with love, as his patron's deare&s;t friend, and whom he calls a &s;econd Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>SEE, my Lucy, the reward of frankne&s;s of heart. My communicativene&s;s has been already encouraged with the peru&s;al of two Letters from the &s;ame excel|lent man to Doctor Bartlett; to whom, from early days (as I &s;hall be &s;oon more particularly informed) he has given an account of all his conduct and move|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="323">
The Doctor drew him&s;elf in, however, by reading to Lord L. and the Ladies, and me, a paragraph or two out of one of them: And he has even allowed me to give my grandmamma and aunt a &s;ight of them. Return them, Lucy, with the other Letter, by the very next po&s;t. He &s;ays, he can deny me no|thing. I wi&s;h I may not be too bold with him&mdash;As for Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, &s;he vows, that &s;he will not let the good man re&s;t till &s;he gets him to communicate what he &s;hall not ab&s;olutely declare to be a &s;ecret, to <HI>as</HI> three &s;i&s;ters, and my Lord L. If the fir&s;t man, &s;he &s;ays, could not re&s;i&s;t <HI>one</HI> woman, how will the Doctor deal with <HI>three,</HI> not one of them behind-hand with the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in curio&s;ity? And all loving him, and whom he pro&s;e&s;&s;es to e&s;teem? You &s;ee, Lucy, that Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on has pretty well got up her &s;pirits again.</P>
<P>JUST now Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on has related to me a con|ver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed between my Lord and Lady L. her&s;elf, and Doctor Bartlett: In which the &s;ubject was their brother and me. The Ladies and my Lord are entirely in my intere&s;ts, and regardful of my punctilio. They roundly told the Doctor, That, be|ing extremely earne&s;t to have their brother marry, they knew not the per&s;on living, whom they wi&s;hed to call his wife preferably to Mi&s;s Byron; could they be &s;ure, that I was ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged. Now, Doctor, &s;aid Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, tell us frankly, What is your opinion of our choice for a more than nomi|nal &s;i&s;ter?</P>
<P>I will make no apologies, Lucy, for repeating all that was repeated to me of this conver&s;ation.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Ay, my good Doctor Bartlett, let us have your free opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> Mi&s;s Byron (I pronounce upon knowledge, for &s;he has more than once &s;ince I have been down, done me the honour of entering into very free and &s;erious conver&s;ations with me) is one of the mo&s;t ex|cellent of women.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="324">
And then he went on, prai&s;ing me for ingenuou&s;|ne&s;s, &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, chearfulne&s;s, and for other good qualities, which his partiality found out in me: And added, Would to heaven that &s;he were neither more nor le&s;s than Lady Grandi&s;on!</P>
<P>God ble&s;s him! thought I&mdash;Don't you join, my Lucy, to &s;ay, at this place, you who love me &s;o dearly, God ble&s;s you, Doctor Bartlett?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Well, but, Doctor, you &s;ay that Mi&s;s By|ron talks freely with you; cannot you gather from her, whether &s;he is inclined to marriage? Whether &s;he is ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged? Lady D. made a pro|po&s;al to her for Lord D.; and in&s;i&s;ted on an an&s;wer to this very que&s;tion: That matter is gone off. As our <HI>gue&s;t,</HI> we would not have Mi&s;s Byron think us im|pertinent. She is very delicate. And as &s;he is &s;o amiably frank-hearted, tho&s;e things &s;he choo&s;es not to mention of her own accord, one would not, you know, officiou&s;ly put to her.</P>
<P>This was a little too much affected. Don't you think &s;o, Lucy? The Doctor, it is evident by his an&s;wer, did.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> It is not likely that &s;uch a &s;ubject can ari&s;e between Mi&s;s Byron and me: And it is &s;trange, me|thinks that Ladies calling each other &s;i&s;ters, &s;hould not be ab&s;olutely mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of this que&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L</HI> Very right, Doctor Bartlett. But Ladies will, in the&s;e points, take a compa&s;s before they ex|plain them&s;elves. A man of Doctor Bartlett's pene|tration and uprightne&s;s, Ladies, &s;hould not be treated with di&s;tance. We are of opinion, Doctor, that Mi&s;s Byron, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;he is ab&s;olutely di&s;en|gaged, could make no difficulty to prefer my brother to all the men in the world. What think you?</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> I have no doubt of it: She thinks her&s;elf under obligations to him. She is goodne&s;s it&s;elf. She mu&s;t love goodne&s;s. Sir Charles's per&s;on, his vivacity, his addre&s;s, his under&s;tanding&mdash;What woman would
<PB N="324" REF="325">
not prefer him to all the men &s;he ever &s;aw? He has met with admirers among the Sex in every nation in which he has &s;et his foot [Ah! Lucy!]. You, La|dies, mu&s;t have &s;een, forgive me (bowing to each) that Mi&s;s Byron has a more than grateful re&s;pect for your brother.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> We think &s;o, Doctor; and wanted to know if <HI>you</HI> did: And &s;o, as my Lord &s;ays, fetched a little compa&s;s about; which we &s;hould not have done to <HI>you.</HI> But you &s;ay, That my brother has had numbers of admirers&mdash;Pray, Doctor, is there any <HI>one</HI> Lady (We imagine there is) that he has preferred to another, in the different nations he has travelled through?</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Ay, Doctor, we want to know this; and if you thought there were <HI>not,</HI> we &s;hould make no &s;cruple to explain our&s;elves, as well to Mi&s;s Byron, as to my brother.</P>
<P>Don't you long to know what an&s;wer the Doctor returned to this, Lucy? I was out of breath with impatience, when Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on repeated it to me.</P>
<P>The Doctor he&s;itated&mdash;And at la&s;t &s;aid; I wi&s;h with all my heart, Mi&s;s Byron could be Lady Gran|di&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> COUD be?&mdash;<HI>Could</HI> be, &s;aid each.</P>
<P>And COULD be? &s;aid the fool to Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, when &s;he repeated it, her heart quite &s;unk.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> (&s;miling) You hinted, Ladies, that you are not <HI>&s;ure</HI> that Mi&s;s Byron is ab&s;olutely di&s;engaged. But, to be open and above-board, I have rea&s;on to believe, that your brother would be concerned, if he knew it, that you &s;hould think of putting &s;uch a que&s;tion as this to any-body but him&s;elf. Why don't you? He once complained to me, that he was afraid his &s;i&s;ters looked upon him as a re&s;erved man; and conde&s;cended to call upon me to put him right, if I thought his appearance &s;uch as would give you grounds for the &s;urmi&s;e.

affairs of intricacy that he engaged in, and particu|larly one, that hangs in &s;u&s;pence; and he would not be fond, I believe, of mentioning it, till he can do it with certainty: But el&s;e, Ladies, there is not a more frank-hearted man in the world, than <HI>your</HI> brother.</P>
<P>See, Lucy, how cautious we ought to be in pa&s;&s;ing judgment on the actions of others, e&s;pecially on tho&s;e of good men, when we want to fa&s;ten blame upon them; perhaps with a low view (envying their &s;upe|rior worth) to bring them down to our own level!&mdash;For are we not all apt to mea&s;ure the merits of others by our own &s;tandard, to give prai&s;e or di&s;prai&s;e to actions or &s;entiments, as they &s;quare with their own?</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> Perhaps, Doctor Bartlett, you don't think your&s;elf at liberty to an&s;wer, whether the&s;e particular affairs are of &s;uch a nature, as will interfere with the <HI>hopes</HI> we have of bringing to effect a marriage between my brother and Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> I had rather refer to Sir Charles him&s;elf on this &s;ubject. If any man in the world de&s;erves from prudence and integrity of heart to be happy in this life, that man is Sir Charles Grandi&s;on. But he is not <HI>quite</HI> happy.</P>
<P>Ah, Lucy!&mdash;The Doctor proceeded. Your bro|ther, Ladies, has often &s;aid to me, That there was hardly a man living who had a more &s;incere value for the Sex than he had; who had been more di&s;tingui&s;hed by the favour of worthy women; yet who had paid dearer for that di&s;tinction than he had done.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Paid dearer! Good Heaven!</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> How could that be?</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> I always abroad heard the Ladies reckon upon Sir Charles, as their own man. His vivacity, his per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, his politene&s;s, his gene|ro&s;ity, his bravery!&mdash;Every woman who &s;poke of him, put him down for a man of gallantry. And is he not a <HI>truly</HI> gallant man?&mdash;I never mentioned it
<PB N="326" REF="327">
before&mdash;But a Lady Olivia, of Florence was much talked of, when I was in that city, as being in love with the hand&s;ome Engli&s;hman, as our brother was commonly called there&mdash;</P>
<P>Lady Olivia! Lady Olivia! repeated each &s;i&s;ter; and why did not your Lord&s;hip?&mdash;</P>
<P>Why? Becau&s;e, tho' &s;he was in love with him, he had no thoughts of her. And, as the Doctor &s;ays, &s;he is but <HI>one</HI> of tho&s;e who admired him where-ever he &s;et his foot.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s me, thought I, what a black &s;wan is a good man!&mdash;Why (as I have often thought, to the credit of our Sex) will not all the men be good?</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> My Lord, you mu&s;t tell us more of this Lady Olivia.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> I know very little more of her. She was reputed to be a woman of high quality and fortune, and great &s;pirit. I once &s;aw her. She is a fine figure of a woman. Dr. Bartlett can, no doubt, give you an account of her.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> Ah, Doctor! What an hi&s;tory could you give us of our brother, if you plea&s;ed!&mdash;But as there is no likelihood that this Lady will be any|thing to my brother, let us return to our fir&s;t &s;ubject.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> By all means. Pray Dr. Bartlett, do you know what my brother's opinion is of Mi&s;s Byron?</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> The highe&s;t that man can have of woman.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> As we are &s;o very de&s;irous to &s;ee my bro|ther happily married, and think he never could have a woman &s;o likely to make him happy, would you ad|vi&s;e us to propo&s;e the alliance to him? We would not to <HI>her,</HI> unle&s;s we thought there were room to hope for his approbation, and that in a very high degree.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> I am under &s;ome concern, my dear Ladies, to be thought to know more of your brother's heart, than &s;i&s;ters do whom he loves &s;o dearly, and who equally love him. I be&s;eech you, give me not &s;o
<PB N="327" REF="328">
much more con&s;equence with him than you imagine you have your&s;elves. I &s;hall be afraid, if you do, that the favour I wi&s;h to &s;tand in with you, is owing more to your brother's di&s;tinction of me, than to your own hearts.</P>
<P><HI>Lord L.</HI> I &s;ee not why we may not talk to my bro|ther directly on this head. Whence is it that we are all three in&s;en&s;ibly drawn in, by each other's example, to this di&s;tance between him and us?&mdash;It is not <HI>his</HI> fault. Did we ever a&s;k him a que&s;tion, that he did not directly an&s;wer, and that without &s;hewing the lea&s;t affectation or re&s;erve?</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> He came over to us all at once &s;o perfect, after an eight or nine years ab&s;ence, with &s;o much power, and &s;uch a will, to do us good, that we were awed into a kind of reverence for him.</P>
<P><HI>Lady L.</HI> Too great obligations from one &s;ide, will indeed create di&s;tance on the other. Grateful hearts will always retain a &s;en&s;e of favours heaped upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. B.</HI> You would give pain to his noble heart, did he think, that you put &s;uch a value upon what he has done. I do a&s;&s;ure you&punc; that he thinks he has hardly performed his duty, by his &s;i&s;ters. And, as occa&s;ions may &s;till offer, you will <HI>find</HI> he thinks &s;o. But let me beg of you to treat him without re&s;erve or diffidence; and that you would put to him all tho&s;e que&s;tions which you would wi&s;h to be an&s;wered. You will find him, I dare &s;ay, very candid, and very explicit.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;s Gr.</HI> That &s;hall be my ta&s;k, when I next &s;ee him. But, dear Doctor Bartlett, if you love us, com|municate to us all that is proper for us to &s;ee, of the corre&s;pondence that pa&s;&s;es between him and you.</P>
<P>The Doctor, it &s;eems, bowed; but an&s;wered not.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee, Lucy, upon the whole, that I have no great <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to build &s;o much, as my uncle, in his la&s;t Letter, imagines I do, on the intere&s;t of the&s;e Ladies and my Lord L. with their brother. <HI>Two or three</HI>

<P>I HAVE had the plea&s;ure of a vi&s;it from my god|father Deane. He dined with us this day in his way to town. The Ladies, Doctor Bartlett, and my Lord L. are charmed with him. Yet I had pain mingled with my plea&s;ure. He took me a&s;ide, and charged me <HI>&s;o</HI> home&mdash;He was <HI>too</HI> inqui&s;itive. I never knew him to be &s;o <HI>very</HI> urgent to know my heart. But I was frank: Very frank: I &s;hould hardly have been ex|cu&s;eable, if I had not, to &s;o good a man, and &s;o dear a friend. Yet he &s;carce knew how to be &s;atisfied with my frankne&s;s.</P>
<P>He will have it, that I look thinner and paler than I u&s;ed to do. That may very well be. My very <HI>&s;oul,</HI> at times&mdash;I know not how I am&mdash;Sir Charles is in &s;u&s;pen&s;e too, from &s;omebody abroad. From my heart I

Why did he not di&s;&s;uade me?&mdash;Neither fortune nor merit an&s;werable!&mdash;A man who knows &s;o well what to do with fortune!&mdash;The Indies, my dear, ought to be his!

<P>But what do you think, Lucy?

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. Sir <HI>CHARLES GRANDISON,</HI> To Dr. <HI>BARTLETT.</HI> [Inclo&s;ed in the preceding.]</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>Friday, Mar. 17.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LAST night I &s;aw interred the remains of my worthy friend Dr. Danby. I had cau&s;ed his two nephews and his niece to be invited: But they did not attend.</P>
<P>As the will was not to be opened till the funeral
<PB N="331" REF="332" MS="y">
was over, about which the good man had given me verbal directions; apprehending, I believe, expo&s;tu|lations from me, had I known the contents; I &s;ent to them this morning to be pre&s;ent at the opening.</P>
<P>Their Attorney, Mr. Sylve&s;ter, a man of character, and good behaviour, brought me a Letter, &s;igned by all three, excu&s;ing them&s;elves on very &s;light pretences, and de&s;iring that <HI>he</HI> might be pre&s;ent for them. I took notice to him, that the behaviour of his principals over-night and now, was neither re&s;pectful to the me|mory of their uncle, nor civil, with regard to me. He hone&s;tly owned, that Mr. Danby having ac|quainted his two nephews, a little before he died, that he had made his will, and that they had very little to expect from him, they, who had been educated by his direction, and made merchants, at his expence, with hopes given them, that he would, at his death, do very hand&s;omely for them, and had never di&s;oblig|ed him, could not be pre&s;ent at the opening of a will, the contents of which they expected to be &s;o morti|fying to them.</P>
<P>I opened it in pre&s;ence of this gentleman. The preamble was an angry one; giving rea&s;ons for his re&s;entment again&s;t the father of the&s;e young per&s;ons, who (tho' his brother) had once, as I hinted to you at Colnebrooke, made a very &s;hocking attempt upon his life. I was hurt, however, to find a re&s;entment carried &s;o far as again&s;t the innocent children of the offender, and into the la&s;t will of &s;o good a man; that will &s;o lately made, as within three weeks of his death; and he given over for three months before.</P>
<P>Will the tenderne&s;s due to the memory of a friend permit me to a&s;k, where would that re&s;entment have &s;topt, had the private man been a monarch, which he could carry into his la&s;t will?</P>
<P>But &s;ee we not, on the other hand, that the&s;e
<PB N="332" REF="333">
children, had they power, would have puni&s;hed their uncle, for di&s;po&s;ing, as he thought fit, of his own fortune; no part of which came to him by inhe|ritance?</P>
<P>They had been educated, as I have &s;aid, at his expence; and, in the phra&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s, well put out. Expences their carele&s;s father would not have been at: He is, in every light, a bad man. How much better had the&s;e children's title been to a more con&s;iderable part of their uncle's e&s;tate than he has bequeathed to them, had they been thankful for the benefits they had actually received! Benefits, which are of &s;uch a nature, that they cannot be taken from them.</P>
<P>Mr. Danby has bequeathed to each of the three, one thou&s;and pounds; but on expre&s;s condition, that they &s;ignify to his executor, within two months after his demi&s;e, their acceptance of it, in full of all demands upon his e&s;tate. If they do not (tender being duly made) the three thou&s;and pounds are to be carried to the u&s;es of the will.</P>
<P>He then appoints his executor; and makes him re|&s;iduary legatee; giving for rea&s;on, that he had been the principal in&s;trument in the hand of Providence, of &s;aving his life.</P>
<P>He bequeaths &s;ome generous remembrances to three of his friends in France; and reque&s;ts his executor to di&s;po&s;e of three thou&s;and pounds to charitable u&s;es, either in France or England, as he thinks fit, and to what particular objects he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>And, by an inventory annexed to the will, his ef|fects in money, bills, actions, and jewels, are made to amount to upwards of thirty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>Mr. Sylve&s;ter complimented me on this great <HI>wind|fall,</HI> as he called it; and a&s;&s;ured me, that it &s;hould be his advice to his clients, that each take his and
<PB N="333" REF="334">
her legacy, and &s;it down contented with it: And he believed, that they the rather would, as, from what their uncle had hinted, they apprehended, that the &s;um of an hundred pounds each, was all they had to hope for.</P>
<P>I enquired into the inclinations and views of the three; and received a very good general account of them; with an hint, that the girl was engaged in a Love-affair.</P>
<P>Their father, after his vile attempt upon his bro|ther's life, was dete&s;ted by all his friends and relations, and went abroad; and the la&s;t news they heard of him, was, that he was in a very ill &s;tate of health, and in unhappy circum&s;tances, in Barbadoes: And very probably by this time is no more.</P>
<P>I de&s;ired Mr. Sylve&s;ter to advi&s;e the young people to recollect them&s;elves; and &s;aid, That I had a di&s;|po&s;ition to be kind to them: And as he could give me only general accounts of their views, pro&s;pects, and engagements, I wi&s;h'd they would, with marks of confidence in me, give me particular ones: But that, whether they complimented me as I wi&s;hed, or not, I was determined, for the &s;ake of their uncle's memory, to do all rea&s;onable &s;ervices to them. Tell them, in a word, Mr. Sylve&s;ter, and do you forgive the &s;eeming vanity, That I am not accu&s;tomed to &s;uffer the narrowne&s;s of other people's hearts to con|tract mine.</P>
<P>The man went away, very much plea&s;ed with what I had &s;aid; and in about two hours, &s;ent me a note, in the names of all his clients, expre&s;&s;ing gra|titude and obligation; and reque&s;ting me to allow him to introduce them all three to me this afternoon.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary things to do, and per&s;ons to &s;ee, in relation to my decea&s;ed friend, which will be di&s;patched over a di&s;h of tea. And therefore I have invited the hone&s;t attorney, and his three clients, to &s;up with me.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="335">
I will not &s;end this to Colnebrooke, where I hope you are all happy (All mu&s;t; for are they not all good? And are not <HI>you</HI> with them?) till I accompany it with the re&s;ult of this evening's conver&s;ation.

<P>MR. Sylve&s;ter, an hone&s;t plea&s;ure &s;hining in his countenance, pre&s;ented to me, fir&s;t, Mi&s;s Dan|by; then, each of her brothers; who all received my welcome with a little con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, as if they had &s;omething to reproach them&s;elves with, and were generou&s;ly a&s;hamed to be overcome. The &s;i&s;ter had the lea&s;t of it: And I &s;aw by that, that &s;he was the lea&s;t blameable, not the lea&s;t mode&s;t; &s;ince I dare &s;ay &s;he had but followed her brothers lead; while they looked down and ba&s;hful, as having all that was done ami&s;s to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Danby is a very pretty, and very genteel young woman. Mr. Thomas and Mr. Edward Dan|by, are agreeable in their per&s;ons and manners, and want not &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t moment I di&s;&s;ipated all their unea&s;ine&s;s; and we &s;at down together with confidence in each other. The hone&s;t attorney had prepared them to be ea&s;y after the fir&s;t introduction.</P>
<P>I offer not to read to you, &s;aid I, the will of your uncle. It is &s;ufficient to repeat what Mr. Sylve&s;ter has no doubt, told you; That you are each of you entitled by it to a thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="336">
They all bowed; and the elder brother &s;ignified their united con&s;ent to accept it upon the terms of the will.</P>
<P>Three thou&s;and pounds more are to be di&s;po&s;ed of to charitable u&s;es, at the di&s;cretion of the executor: Three other legacies are left to three different gentle|men in France: And the large remainder, which will not be le&s;s than four-and-twenty thou&s;and pounds, falls to the executor, as re&s;iduary legatee, equally un|expected and unde&s;ired.</P>
<P>The elder brother &s;aid, God ble&s;s you with it, Sir. The &s;econd &s;aid, It could not have fallen to a worthier man. The young Lady's lips moved: But words proceeded not from them. Yet her eyes &s;hewed that her lips made me a compliment:</P>
<P>It is ungenerous, Dr. Bartlett, to keep expecting minds in &s;u&s;pence, tho' with a view of obliging in the end. The &s;urprize intended to be rai&s;ed on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, carries in its appearance an air of in&s;ult. I have, &s;aid I, a great de&s;ire to do you &s;ervice. Now let me know, gentlemen (I will talk to the young Lady &s;ingly, perhaps) what your expectations were upon your uncle; what will do for each of you, to enable you to enter the world with advantage, in the way you have been brought up; and, as I told your worthy friend, Mr, Sylve&s;ter, I will be ready to do you all rea&s;onable &s;ervice.&mdash;But, hold, Sir; for Mr. Thomas Danby was going to &s;peak; you &s;hall con&s;ider before you an&s;wer me. The matter is of im|portance. Be explicit. I love openne&s;s and &s;incerity. I will withdraw, till you have con&s;ulted together. Command me in when you have determined.</P>
<P>I withdrew to my &s;tudy: And, in about a quarter of an hour, they let me know, that they were ready to attend me. I went in to them. They looked upon one another. Come, gentlemen don't fear to &s;peak: Con&s;ider me, for your uncle's &s;ake, as your brother.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="337">
The elder brother was going to &s;peak; but, he&s;i|tating, Come, &s;aid I, let me <HI>lead</HI> you into the mat|ter&mdash;Pray, Sir, what is your pre&s;ent &s;ituation? What are your pre&s;ent circum&s;tances?</P>
<P>My father, Sir, was unhappy&mdash;My father&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, Sir, no more of your father&mdash;He <HI>could</HI> do nothing for you. Your whole dependence, I pre|&s;ume, was upon your uncle.</P>
<P>My uncle, Sir, gave us all our education&mdash;My uncle gave each brother a thou&s;and guineas for put|ting out each to a merchant; five hundred only of which &s;ums were &s;o employed; and the other five hundred guineas, are in &s;afe hands.</P>
<P>Your uncle, Sir, all reverence to his memory, was an excellent man.</P>
<P>Indeed, Sir, he was,</P>
<P>And what, Sir, is the bu&s;ine&s;s you were brought up to?</P>
<P>My ma&s;ter is a We&s;t-India merchant.</P>
<P>And what, Mr. Danby, are your pro&s;pects in that way?</P>
<P>Exceeding hopeful, Sir, they would have been&mdash;My ma&s;ter intended to propo&s;e to my uncle, had he lived to come to town, to take me in a quarter-partner with him directly; and, in a twelvemonth's time, an half-partner.</P>
<P>A very good &s;ign in your favour, Sir. You mu&s;t have behaved your&s;elf well. And will he now do it?</P>
<P>Ah! Sir&mdash;And was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Upon what terms, Mr. Danby, would he have propo&s;ed to your uncle to take you in a quarter-partner?</P>
<P>Sir&mdash;he talked of&mdash;</P>
<P>Of what?</P>
<P>Four thou&s;and pounds, Sir. But my uncle never gave us hopes of more than three thou&s;and guineas each, be&s;ides the thou&s;and he had given: And when he had &s;o much rea&s;on to re&s;ent the unhappy &s;teps of
<PB N="337" REF="338">
my father, he let us know, that he would not do <HI>my-thing</HI> for us: And, to &s;ay truth, the thou&s;and pounds left us in the will, is more than we expected.</P>
<P>Very ingenuous. I love you for your &s;incerity. But, pray, tell me, Will four thou&s;and pounds be well laid out in a quarter-partner&s;hip?</P>
<P>To &s;ay truth, Sir, my ma&s;ter had a view, at the year's end, if nothing unexpected happened to pre|vent it, to give me his niece in marriage; and then to admit me into a half of the bu&s;ine&s;s, which would be equivalent to a fortune of as much more.</P>
<P>And do you love the young woman?</P>
<P>Indeed I do.</P>
<P>And does &s;he countenance your addre&s;s?</P>
<P>If her uncle&mdash;I don't doubt if <HI>her</HI> uncle could have prevailed upon <HI>my</HI> uncle&mdash;</P>
<P>Well, Sir, I am your uncle's executor. Now, Sir, (to Mr. Edward Danby) let me know your Situation; your pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>Sir, I was put to a French wine-merchant. My ma&s;ter is in years. I am the &s;ole manager of his bu|&s;ine&s;s; and he would leave off to me, I believe, and to his nephew, who knows not &s;o much of it as I do, nor has the acquaintance, either in France or Eng|land, that I have; could I rai&s;e money to purcha&s;e half the &s;tock.</P>
<P>And what, Sir, is nece&s;&s;ary for that purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>O Sir! at lea&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and pounds. But had my uncle left me the three thou&s;and we once hoped for, I could have got the other half at an ea&s;y intere&s;t; for I am well beloved, and have always borne a good character.</P>
<P>What did you &s;uppo&s;e your uncle would do with the bulk of his fortune (you judged it, I &s;uppo&s;e, to be large) if you expected no more than three thou|&s;and guineas each at the mo&s;t, be&s;ides what he had given you?</P>
<P>We all thought, Sir, &s;aid Mr. Edward Danby, it
<PB N="338" REF="339">
would be <HI>yours,</HI> from the time that he owed his life to your courage and conduct. We never entertained hopes of being his heirs general: And he &s;everal times told me, when I was in France, that <HI>you</HI> &s;hould be his heir.</P>
<P>He never hinted that to me. What I did was as nece&s;&s;ary to be done for my own Safety, as for his. He much over-rated my &s;ervices. But what are your pro&s;pects, Mr. Edward Danby, in the French wine|trade?</P>
<P>O Sir, very great!</P>
<P>And will your ma&s;ter leave off to you and his ne|phew, think you?</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay he would, and be glad of retiring to En|field, where he has a hou&s;e he is &s;o fond of, that he would be continually there, by his good-will.</P>
<P>And have you, Sir, any pro&s;pect of adding to your circum&s;tances by marriage?</P>
<P>Women are a drug, Sir. I have no doubt of of|fers, if once I were my own ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;tarted. His &s;i&s;ter looked angry. His brother was not plea&s;ed: Mr. Sylve&s;ter, who, it &s;eems, is an old bachelor, laughed&mdash;</P>
<P>A <HI>true</HI> merchant this already! thought I.</P>
<P>Well, now, &s;hall I have your con&s;ents, gentlemen, to take your &s;i&s;ter a&s;ide?&mdash;Will you tru&s;t your&s;elf with me, Mi&s;s Danby? Or had you rather an&s;wer my que&s;tion in company?</P>
<P>Sir, your character, your goodne&s;s, is &s;o well known, I &s;cruple not to attend you.</P>
<P>I took her hand, and led her to my &s;tudy, leaving the door open, to the drawing-room in which they were. I &s;eated her. Then &s;at down, but &s;till held her hand.</P>
<P>Now, my dear Mi&s;s Danby, you are to &s;uppo&s;e me, as the executor of your uncle, his repre&s;entative. If you had that good uncle before you, and he was urg|ing you to tell him what would make you happy, with
<PB N="339" REF="340">
an a&s;&s;urance, that he would do all in his power to|wards it; and if you would open your mind freely to him; with equal freedom open it to me. There was only this difference between us: He had re&s;entments again&s;t your father, which he carried too far, when he extended them to his innocent children [But it was an atrocious attempt, that embitter'd his otherwi&s;e benevolent &s;pirit]: I have no re&s;entment; and am armed with his power, and have all the will he ever could have, to &s;erve you. Aud now, let me know, what will effectually do it?</P>
<P>The worthy girl wept. She looked down. She &s;eemed as if &s;he were pulling threads out of her hand|kerchief. But was unable to return any other an|&s;wer, than what her eyes, once ca&s;t up, as if to Hea|ven, made for her.</P>
<P>Give me, my good Mi&s;s Danby (I would not di&s;tre&s;s you) give me, as your brothers did of <HI>their</HI> Situation, &s;ome account of <HI>yours.</HI> Do you live with either of your brothers?</P>
<P>No, Sir. I live with an aunt: My mother's &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Is &s;he good to you?</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, very good. But &s;he has children; and cannot be &s;o good as &s;he would be to me. Yet &s;he has always been kind; and has made the be&s;t of my un|cle's allowance for my education: And my fortune, which is unbroken, is the &s;ame &s;um that he gave my brothers: And it is in good hands: And the inter|e&s;t of it, with my aunt's additional goodne&s;s and ma|nagement, enables me to make a genteel figure: And, with my own hou&s;ewifry, I never have wanted &s;ome little matters for my pocket.</P>
<P>Good girl, thought I!&mdash;Mercantile carle! thy bro|ther Edward, pretty one! How dared he to &s;ay, that women are drugs?&mdash;Who, in their oeconomy, &s;hort as their power is, are generally &s;uperior to men!</P>
<P>Your uncle was very good to put you upon a foot with your brothers, in his bounty to them; as now he
<PB N="340" REF="341">
has al&s;o done in his will: And a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf, that his repre&s;entative, will be equally kind to you as to your brothers. But &s;hall I a&s;k you, as your uncle would have done&mdash;Is there any one man in the world, whom you prefer to another?</P>
<P>She was &s;ilent; looked down; and again picked her handkerchief.</P>
<P>I called in her elder brother (not the drug-mer|chant) and a&s;ked him, What he knew of his &s;i&s;ter's affections?</P>
<P>Why, my good Dr. Bartlett, are the&s;e women a&s;hamed of owning a laudable pa&s;&s;ion? Surely there is nothing &s;hameful in <HI>di&s;creet</HI> Love.</P>
<P>Her brother acquainted me with the &s;tory of her Love; the good girl blu&s;hing, and looking down all the while, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;weet thief, who had &s;tolen a heart, and being required to re&s;tore it, had been guilty of a new cheat, and given her own in&s;tead of it.</P>
<P>The &s;on of Mr. Galliard, an eminent Turkey merchant, is the man with whom &s;he has made this exchange. His father, who lives in the neighbour|hood of her aunt, had &s;ent him abroad, in the way of his traffick; partly with a view to prevent his mar|rying Mi&s;s Danby, till it &s;hould be &s;een whether her uncle would do any-thing con&s;iderable for her: And he was but ju&s;t returned; and, in order to be allowed to &s;tay at home, had promi&s;ed his father never to marry without his con&s;ent: But neverthele&s;s loved his &s;i&s;ter, Mr. Danby &s;aid, above all women; and de|clared that he never would be the hu&s;band of any other.</P>
<P>I a&s;ked, whether the father had any objections, but tho&s;e of fortune, to his &s;on's choice; and was an|&s;wered, No. He <HI>could</HI> have no other, the young man, like a brother, &s;aid: There was not a more vir|tuous and di&s;creet young woman in the kingdom than his &s;i&s;ter, tho' he &s;aid it, that &s;hould not &s;ay it.</P>
<P>Tho' you &s;ay it, that <HI>&s;hould</HI> &s;ay it. Is not our
<PB N="341" REF="342">
relation intitled to the &s;ame ju&s;tice that we would do to another?</P>
<P>We mu&s;t not blame indi&s;criminately, continued I, all fathers who expect a fortune to be brought into their family, in &s;ome mea&s;ure equivalent to the benefit the new-comer hopes to receive from it; e&s;pecially in mercantile families, if the young man is to be ad|mitted into a &s;hare with his father; who, by the way, <HI>may</HI> have other children&mdash;</P>
<P>He has&mdash;</P>
<P>Something by way of equivalent for the part he gives up, &s;hould be done. Love is a &s;elfi&s;h Deity. He puts two per&s;ons upon preferring their own in|tere&s;ts, nay, a gratification of their pa&s;&s;ion often <HI>a|gain&s;t</HI> their intere&s;ts, to tho&s;e of every-body el&s;e; and rea&s;on, di&s;cretion, duty, are frequently given up in a competition with it. But Love, neverthele&s;s, will not do every-thing for the ardent pair. Parents know this: And ought not to pay for the ra&s;hne&s;s they wi&s;h to prevent, but cannot.</P>
<P>They were attentive. I proceeded, addre&s;&s;ing my|&s;elf to both in the mercantile &s;tyle.</P>
<P>Is a father, who by his prudence, has weathered many a &s;torm, and got &s;afe into port, obliged to re|embark in the voyage of Life, with the young folks, who perhaps in a little while, will con&s;ider him as an incumbrance, and grudge him his cabin? Parents (tho' a young man, I have always thought in this manner) &s;hould be indulgent; but children, when they put them&s;elves into one &s;cale, &s;hould allow the parent his due weight in the other. You are angry at this father, are you not, my dear Mi&s;s Danby?</P>
<P>I &s;aid this, to hear what an&s;wer &s;he would return.</P>
<P>Indeed I am not. Mr. Galliard knows be&s;t his own affairs, and what they require. I have &s;aid &s;o twenty and twenty times: And young Mr. Galliard is convinced, that his father is not to be blamed, having other children. And, to own the truth (look|ing
<PB N="342" REF="343">
on the floor, we both &s;it down, and wi&s;h together, now-and-then: But what &s;ignifies wi&s;hing?</P>
<P>My &s;i&s;ter will now have two thou&s;and pounds: Perhaps when old Mr. Galliard &s;ees, that his &s;on's affections&mdash;</P>
<P>Old Mr. Galliard, interrupted I, &s;hall be a&s;ked to do nothing inconvenient to him&s;elf, or that is not &s;trictly right by his other children: Nor &s;hall the niece of my late worthy friend enter into his family, with di&s;credit to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Notice being given, that &s;upper was ready, I took the brother and &s;i&s;ter each by the hand; and, enter|ing the drawing-room with them, Enjoy, &s;aid I, the little repa&s;t that will be &s;et before you. If it be in my power to make you all three happy, happy you &s;hall be.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t give great plea&s;ure, my dear Dr. Bartlett, you will believe, to a man of my lively &s;en&s;ations, to &s;ee three very different faces in the &s;ame per&s;ons, from tho&s;e they had entered with. I imagined more than once, as the grateful eyes of the &s;i&s;ter, and tongues of the brothers, expre&s;&s;ed their joy, that I &s;aw my late worthy friend looking down upon us, delighted, and not with di&s;approbation, upon his choice of an executor, who was determined to &s;upply the defects, which the frailty of human nature, by an ever-&s;trong re&s;entment on one hand, and an overflowing grati|tude on the other, had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>I told Mr. Thomas Danby, that be&s;ides his legacy, he might reckon upon five thou&s;and pounds, and enter accordingly into treaty for and with his ma&s;ter's niece.</P>
<P>Mr. Edward Danby, I commi&s;&s;ioned, on the &s;trength of the like additional &s;um, to treat with the gentle|man he had &s;erved.</P>
<P>And you, my good Mi&s;s Danby, &s;aid I, &s;hall ac|quaint your favoured Mr. Galliard, That, be&s;ides the two thou&s;and pounds already yours, you will have five
<PB N="343" REF="344">
thou&s;and pounds more at his &s;ervice. And if the&s;e &s;ums an&s;wer not your full purpo&s;es, I expect you will let me know; &s;ince, whether they do or not, my re|&s;pect to the memory of your worthy uncle &s;hall be &s;hewn to the value of more than the&s;e three &s;ums to his relations. I never will be a richer man than I ought to be: And you mu&s;t inform me, what other relations you have, and of their different &s;ituations in life, that I may be enabled to amend a will, made in a long and painful &s;ickne&s;s, which might four a di&s;po|&s;ition that was naturally all benevolence.</P>
<P>They wept; looked at one another; dried their eyes; and wept again. Mr. Sylve&s;ter al&s;o wept for joy. I thought my pre&s;ence painful to them; and withdrew to my Study; and &s;hut the door, that I might not add to their pain.</P>
<P>At my return&mdash;Do you&mdash;Do you, referred each brother to the other: And Mr. Thomas Danby get|ting up to &s;peak, I &s;ee, my friends, &s;aid I, your grate|ful hearts in your countenances. Do you think my plea&s;ure is not, at lea&s;t, equal to yours? I am <HI>more</HI> than rewarded in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having en|deavoured to make a right u&s;e of the power entru&s;ted to me. You will each of you, I hope (thus &s;et forward) be eminent in his particular bu&s;ine&s;s. The merchants of Great Britain are the mo&s;t u&s;eful mem|bers of the community. If I have obliged you, let me recommend to you, each in his &s;everal way, ac|cording to his ability, and as opportunity may offer, to rai&s;e tho&s;e worthy hearts, that inevitable calamities &s;hall make &s;piritle&s;s. Look upon what is done for you, not as the reward of any particular merits in your&s;elves, but as your debt to that Providence, which makes it a principal part of your religion, To do good to your fellow-creatures. In a word, let me enjoin you, in all your tran&s;actions, to <HI>remember mercy,</HI> as well as <HI>ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>The brothers with folded hands, declared, that
<PB N="344" REF="345">
their hearts were opened by the example &s;et them; and, they hoped, would never be &s;hut. The &s;i&s;ter <HI>looked</HI> the &s;ame declaration.</P>
<P>Mr. Sylve&s;ter, rai&s;ed with this &s;cene of gratitude, tears in his hone&s;t eyes, &s;aid, That he &s;hould be im|patient till he had looked into his affairs, and thro' his acquaintance, in order to qualify him&s;elf to do &s;ome little good, after &s;uch a <HI>&s;elf-rewarding</HI> example.</P>
<P>If a private man, my dear Dr. Bartlett, could be a means of expanding thus the hearts of four per&s;ons, none of them unworthy, what good might not princes, and tho&s;e who have princely fortunes, do?&mdash;Yet, you &s;ee, I have done nothing but mere ju&s;tice. I have not given up any-thing that was my own, before this Will gave me a power, that perhaps was put into my hands, as a new trial of the integrity of my heart.</P>
<P>But what poor creatures are we, my dear friend, that the very avoiding the occa&s;ion of a wrong action, &s;hould gladden our hearts, as with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;omething meritorious?</P>
<P>At parting, I told the nephews, That I expected to hear from them the moment any-thing &s;hould be brought to effect; and let their ma&s;ters and them agree, or not, I would take the &s;peedie&s;t methods that could be fallen upon, to transfer to them, and to their &s;i&s;ter, &s;uch actions and &s;tocks, as would put them in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they were intitled to, as well by my promi&s;e, as by their uncle's will.</P>
<P>I was obliged to injoin them &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Their &s;i&s;ter wept; and when I pre&s;&s;ed her hand at taking leave of her, gratefully returned the pre&s;&s;ure; but in a manner &s;o mode&s;t (recollecting her&s;elf into &s;ome little confu&s;ion) that &s;hewed gratitude had po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her whole heart, and &s;et her above the forms of her &s;ex.</P>
<P>The good attorney, as much rai&s;ed, as if he were one of the per&s;ons benefited, joined with the two bro|thers in invoking ble&s;&s;ings upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="346">
So much, my dear Dr. Bartlett, for this night. The pa&s;t day is a day that I am not di&s;plea&s;ed with.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI. Dr. <HI>BARTLETT,</HI> To Mi&s;s <HI>BYRON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March 18.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Pre&s;ent to you, madam, the account you de&s;ired to &s;ee, as extracted by my kin&s;man from my pa|pers. You &s;eemed to wi&s;h it to be ha&s;tened for you: It is not what it might have been; but more facts, I pre&s;ume, will an&s;wer your intention. Be plea&s;ed, therefore, to accept it with your u&s;ual goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>"DR. Bartlett went abroad as governor of a young man of quality; Mr. Lorimer, I am to call him, to conceal his real name. He was the very re|ver&s;e of young Mr. Grandi&s;on. He was not only rude and ungovernable; but proud, ill-natured, ma|licious, even ba&s;e.</P>
<P>"The Doctor was exceedingly aver&s;e to take upon him the charge of the wicked youth abroad; having had too many in&s;tances of the badne&s;s of his nature while in England: But he was prevailed upon by the &s;olicitations of his father (who repre&s;ented it as an act of the greate&s;t charity to him and his family) as well as by the &s;olemn promi&s;es of good behaviour from the young man; for he was known to regard the ad|vice of Dr. Bartlett more than that of any other per|&s;on.</P>
<P>"The Doctor and Mr. Lorimer were at Turin, when young Mr. Grandi&s;on (who had been &s;ome months in France) for the fir&s;t time arrived in that city; then in the eighteenth year of his age.</P>
<P>"Dr. Bartlett had not a more profligate pupil, than Mr. Grandi&s;on had a governor; tho' recommended by General W. his uncle by the mother's &s;ide. It
<PB N="346" REF="347">
u&s;ed to be ob&s;erved in places where they made but a few days re&s;idence, that the young gentleman ought to have been the governor, Mon&s;ieur Creutzer the go|verned. Mr. Grandi&s;on had, in &s;hort, the happine&s;s, by his prudence, to e&s;cape &s;everal &s;nares laid for his virtue, by a wretch, who hoped, if he could betray him into them, to &s;ilence the remon&s;trances of the young man, upon his evil conduct; and to hinder him from complaining of him to his father.</P>
<P>"Mr. Grandi&s;on became acquainted with Dr. Bartlett at Turin: Mon&s;ieur Creutzer, at the &s;ame time, commenced an intimacy with Mr. Lorimer; and the two former were not more united from good qualities, than the two latter were from bad.</P>
<P>"Several riotous things were done by Creutzer and Lorimer, who, whatever the Doctor could do to &s;eparate them, were hardly ever a&s;under. One of their enormities fell under the cognizance of the civil magi&s;trate; and was not made ea&s;y to Lorimer with|out great intere&s;t and expence: While Creutzer fled to Rome, to avoid condign puni&s;hment; and wrote to Mr. Grandi&s;on to join him there.</P>
<P>"Then it was, that Mr. Grandi&s;on wrote (as he had often ineffectually threatened to do) to repre&s;ent to his father the profligacy of the man; and to re|que&s;t him to appoint him another governor; or to permit him to return to England till he had made choice of one for him; begging of Dr. Bartlett, that he would allow him, 'till he had an an&s;wer from his father, to apply to him for advice and in&s;truction.</P>
<P>"The an&s;wer of his father was, That he heard of his prudence from every mouth: That he was at liberty to chu&s;e what <HI>companion</HI> he plea&s;ed: But that he gave him no <HI>governor</HI> but his own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>"Mr. Grandi&s;on then, more earne&s;tly than be|fore, and with an humility and diffidence, &s;uited to his natural genero&s;ity of temper, that never grew upon indulgence, be&s;ought the Doctor's direction:
<PB N="347" REF="348">
And when they were obliged to &s;eparate, they e&s;ta|bli&s;hed a corre&s;pondence which never will end but with the life of one of them.</P>
<P>"Mr. Grandi&s;on laid before the Doctor all his plans; &s;ubmitting his conduct to him, as well with regard to the pro&s;ecution of his &s;tudies, as to his tra|vels: But they had not long corre&s;ponded in this manner, when the Doctor let him know, that it was needle&s;s to con&s;ult him <HI>aforehand;</HI> and the more &s;o, as it often occa&s;ioned a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of excellent re&s;olu|tions: But he be&s;ought him to continue to him, an ac|count of all he undertook, of all he performed, and of every material incident of his life; not only as his narrations would be matter of the highe&s;t entertain|ment to him; but as they would furni&s;h him with le&s;&s;ons from example, that might be of greater force upon the unhappy Lorimer, than his own precepts.</P>
<P>"While the Doctor was pa&s;&s;ing thro' but a few of the cities in Lombardy, Mr. Grandi&s;on made al|mo&s;t the tour of Europe; and yet gave him&s;elf time to make &s;uch remarks upon per&s;ons, places, and things, as could hardly be believed to be the ob&s;erva|tions of &s;o young a man. Lorimer, mean time, was engaged in &s;hews, fpectacles, and in the diver&s;ions of the places in <HI>which he lived,</HI> as it might be &s;aid, ra|ther, than <HI>thro' which he pa&s;&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>"The Doctor, at one time, was the more patient with the&s;e delays, as he was willing that the carnival at Venice &s;hould be over, before he &s;uffered his pupil to go to that city. But Lorimer, &s;u&s;pecting his in|tention, &s;lipt thither unknown to his governor, at the very beginning of it; and the Doctor was forced to follow him. And when there, had the mortification of <HI>hearing</HI> of him (for the young man avoided his go|vernor as much as po&s;&s;ible) as one of the mo&s;t riotous per&s;ons there.</P>
<P>"In vain did the Doctor, when he &s;aw his pupil, &s;et before him the example of Mr. Grandi&s;on; a
<PB N="348" REF="349">
younger man. All the effect the Letters he u&s;ed to read to him had upon him, was, to make him hate the more both his Governor and Mr. Grandi&s;on. By one Letter only did he do him&s;elf temporary credit. It was written &s;ome months before it was &s;hewn him, in which Mr. Grandi&s;on de&s;cribed &s;ome places of note, thro' which he had pa&s;&s;ed, and thro' which the Doc|tor and his charge had al&s;o more lately pa&s;&s;ed. The mean creature contrived to &s;teal it; and his father having often urged for a &s;pecimen of his &s;on's ob|&s;ervations on his travels, he copied it almo&s;t verbatim, and tran&s;mitted it as his own to his father; only let|ting the Doctor know, after he had &s;ent it away; that he <HI>had</HI> written.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Doctor doubted not, but Lorimer had ex|po&s;ed him&s;elf; but was very much &s;urpri&s;ed, when he received a congratulatory Letter from the father on his &s;on's improvements, mingled with &s;ome little a&s;perity on the Doctor, for having &s;et out his &s;on to his di&s;ad|vantage: "I could not doubt," &s;aid the fond father, "that a &s;on of mine had genius: He wanted no|thing but to apply,"&mdash;And then he gave orders for doubling the value of his next remittance.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Doctor took the young gentleman to ta&s;k about it. He owned what he had done, and gloried in his contrivance. But his governor thought it incum|bent upon him to undeceive the father, and to &s;ave him the extraordinary part of his remittance.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The young man was enraged at the Doctor, for <HI>expo&s;ing</HI> him, as he called it, to his father, and for the check he was continually giving to his lawle&s;s ap|petites; and falling into acquaintance with a cour|tezan, who was infamous for ruining many young tra|vellers by her &s;ubtle and dangerous contrivances, they joined in a re&s;olution to revenge them&s;elves on the Doctor, whom they con&s;idered as their greate&s;t enemy.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Several projects they fell upon; One, in parti|cular,
<PB N="349" REF="350">
was, to accu&s;e him, by a third hand, as con|cerning him&s;elf with affairs of &s;tate in Venice; A crime, which in that jealous republic, is never over|looked, and generally ends fatally for the accu&s;ed; who, if &s;eized, is hardly ever heard of afterwards. From this danger he narrowly e&s;caped, by means of his general good character, and remarkable inoffen|&s;ivene&s;s, and the profligatene&s;s of his accu&s;ers: Nor knew he his danger till many months afterwards. The Doctor believes, that he fared the better for be|ing an Engli&s;hman, and a governor to the &s;on of a Briti&s;h nobleman, who made &s;o con&s;iderable a figure in England; becau&s;e the Italians in general reap &s;o much advantage from the travellers of this nation, that they are ready to favour and encourage them a|bove tho&s;e of any other.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The Doctor had been very &s;olicitous to be ac|quitted of his ungracious charge. In every Letter he wrote to England, this was one of his prayers: But &s;till the father, who knew not what to do with his &s;on at home, had be&s;ought his patience; and wrote to his &s;on in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, after reproaching him for his ungraciou&s;ne&s;s, to pay an implicit obedi|ence to the Doctor.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The father was a learned man. Great pains had been taken with Lorimer, to make him know &s;omething of the antient Greek and Roman hi&s;tories. The father was <HI>very</HI> de&s;irous, that his &s;on &s;hould &s;ee the famous places of old Greece, of which he him|&s;elf had read &s;o much: And with great difficulty, the Doctor got the young man to leave Venice, where the vile woman, and the diver&s;ions of the place, had taken &s;candalous hold of him.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Athens was the city, at which the father had de|&s;ired they would make &s;ome &s;tay; and from thence vi&s;it other parts of the Morea. And there the young man found his woman got before him, according to private agreement between them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="351">
<Q REND="inline">"It was &s;ome time before the Doctor found out that the very woman who had acted &s;o abandoned a part with Lorimer at Venice, was his mi&s;tre&s;s at Athens: And when he did, he applied, on &s;ome fre&s;h enormities committed by Lorimer, to the tribunal which the Chri&s;tians have there, con&s;i&s;ting of eight venerable men cho&s;en out of the eight quarters of the city, to determine cau&s;es among Chri&s;tians; and they taking cognizance of the facts, the wicked woman &s;uborned wretches to accu&s;e the Doctor to the Cadi, who is the Turki&s;h judge of the place, as a dangerous and di&s;affected per&s;on; and the Cadi being, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed, corrupted by pre&s;ents, got the Vayvode, or Governor, to interfere; and the Doctor was &s;eized, and thrown into pri&s;on: His Chri&s;tian friends in the place were forbidden to interpo&s;e in his favour; and pen and ink, and all acce&s;s to him were prohibited.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"The vile woman, having concerted mea&s;ures with the per&s;ons &s;he had &s;uborned, for continuing the Doctor in his &s;evere confinement, &s;et out with her paramour for Venice; and there they rioted as before.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Beauchamp, a young man of learning and fine parts, happened to make an acquaintance with Mr. Grandi&s;on in the i&s;land of Candia, where they met as countrymen, which, from a &s;ympathy of minds, grew immediately into an intimacy that will hardly ever end. This young gentleman, in the cour&s;e of his travels, vi&s;iting Athens, about this time, was informed of the Doctor's misfortune, by one of the eight Chri&s;tians, who con&s;tituted the tribunal a|bove-mentioned, and who was an affectionate friend of the Doctor, tho' forbidden to bu&s;y him&s;elf in his cau&s;e: And Mr. Beauchamp (who had heard Mr. Grandi&s;on &s;peak of the Doctor with an uncommon af|fection) knowing that Mr. Grandi&s;on was then at Con&s;tantinople, di&s;patched a man on purpo&s;e, to ac|quaint him with the affair, and with all the particu|lars he could get of the ca&s;e, authenticated as much as the nature of the thing would admit.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="351" REF="352">
<Q REND="inline">"Mr. Grandi&s;on was equally grieved and a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the information. He in&s;tantly applied to the Engli&s;h emba&s;&s;ador at the Porte, as al&s;o to the French mini&s;ter there, with whom he had made an acquaintance: They to the Grand Vizir: And an order was i&s;&s;ued for &s;etting the Doctor at liberty. Mr. Grandi&s;on, in order to urge the di&s;patch of the Chiaux, who carried it, accompanied him, and arri|ved at Athens, ju&s;t as the Vayvode had determined to get rid of the whole affair in a private manner (the Doctor's finances being exhau&s;ted) by the bow|&s;tring. The danger endeared the Doctor to Mr. Grandi&s;on; a relief &s;o &s;ea&s;onable endeared Mr. Grandi&s;on to the Doctor; to them <HI>both</HI> Mr. Beau|champ, who would not &s;tir from Athens, till he had &s;een him delivered; having bu&s;ied him&s;elf in the in|terim, in the be&s;t manner he could (tho' he was ob|liged to u&s;e caution and &s;ecrecy) to do him &s;ervice, and to &s;u&s;pend the fatal blow.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Here was a cement to a friend&s;hip (that had been begun between the young gentlemen from likene&s;s of manners) between them and the Doctor, whom they have had the goodne&s;s ever &s;ince to regard, as their father: And to this day it is one of the Doctor's de|lights to write to his worthy &s;on Beauchamp all that he can come at, relating to the life and actions of a man, whom the one regards as an example; the other as an honour to the human race.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"It was &s;ome time before the Doctor knew for certain, that the ungracious Lorimer had been con|&s;enting to the &s;hocking treatment he had met with; for the wretches whom the vile woman had &s;uborned, had made their e&s;cape from Athens before the arrival of Mr. Grandi&s;on and the Chiaux; the flagitious youth had written to his father, in terms of the deepe&s;t &s;orrow, an account of what had befallen his governor; and his father had taken the be&s;t mea&s;ures that could be fallen upon at &s;o great a di&s;tance, for
<PB N="352" REF="353">
the Doctor's &s;uccour and liberty: But in all probabi|lity, he would have been lo&s;t before tho&s;e mea&s;ures could have taken effect.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lorimer's father, little thinking that his &s;on had connived at the plot formed again&s;t his governor, be|&s;ought him, when he had obtained his liberty, not to leave his &s;on to his own devices. The Doctor, as little thinking then, that Lorimer had been capable of a ba&s;ene&s;s &s;o very villainous, in compa&s;&s;ion both to father and &s;on, went to Venice, and got him out of the hands of the vile women; and then to Rome: But there, the unhappy wretch continuing his profli|gate cour&s;es, became at la&s;t a &s;acrifice to his di&s;&s;olute|ne&s;s; and his death was a deliverance to his Family, to the Doctor, and to the Earth.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"On his death-bed he confe&s;&s;ed the plot, which the infamous courtezan had meditated again&s;t the Doctor at Venice, as well as his connivance at that which &s;he had carried into execution at Athens. He died in horror not to be de&s;cribed; begging for longer life, and promi&s;ing reformation on that condition. The manner of his death, and the crimes he confe&s;|&s;ed him&s;elf guilty of, by the in&s;tigation of the mo&s;t a|bandoned of women, be&s;ide tho&s;e committed again&s;t his governor, &s;o &s;hocked and grieved the Doctor, that he fell ill, and his Recovery was long doubted of.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mean time Mr. Grandi&s;on vi&s;ited &s;ome parts of A&s;ia and Afric, Egypt particularly; corre&s;ponding all the time with Dr. Bartlett, and allowing the corre|&s;pondence to pa&s;s into the hands of Mr. Beauchamp; as he did that which he held with Mr. Beauchamp, to be communicated to the Doctor.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"When Mr. Grandi&s;on returned to Italy, find|ing there his two friends, he engaged the Doctor to accompany Mr. Beauchamp in that part of his tour into &s;ome of the Ea&s;tern regions, which he him&s;elf had been particularly plea&s;ed with, and, as he &s;aid, wanted to be more particularly informed of: And
<PB N="353" REF="354">
<HI>therefore</HI> in&s;i&s;ted, that it &s;hould be taken at his own expence. He knew that Mr. Beauchamp had a &s;tep|mother, who had prevailed on his father to take off two-thirds of the allowance he made him on his travels.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Beauchamp very reluctantly complied with the condition &s;o generou&s;ly impo&s;ed on him by his be|loved friend; another of who&s;e arguments was, That &s;uch a tour would be the mo&s;t likely means to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the health of a Man equally dear to both.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Grandi&s;on never was at a lo&s;s for arguments to keep in countenance the per&s;ons whom he benefit|ed; and to make their acceptance of his favours ap|pear not only to be their duty, but an obligation laid on him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Grandi&s;on him&s;elf, when the two gentle|men &s;et out on their tour, was engaged in &s;ome af|fairs at Bologna and Florence, which gave him great embarra&s;ment.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Dr. Barlett and Mr. Beauchamp, vi&s;ited the principal i&s;lands of the Archipelago: After which, the Doctor left the young gentleman pur&s;uing his cour&s;e to Con&s;tantinople, with intention to vi&s;it &s;ome parts of A&s;ia, and took the opportunity of a ve&s;&s;el that was bound for Leghorn, to return thither.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"His health was happily e&s;tabli&s;hed: And, know|ing that Mr. Grandi&s;on expected the long-de&s;ired call from his father to return to England, and that it was <HI>likely</HI> that he could be of u&s;e to his ward Mi&s;s Jervois, and her affairs, in her guardian's ab&s;ence, he was the more de&s;irous to return to Italy.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Mr. Grandi&s;on rejoiced at his arrival: And &s;oon after &s;et out for Paris, in order to attend there the expected call; leaving Emily, in the interim, to his care.</Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"Lorimer's father did not long &s;urvive his &s;on. He expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in his la&s;t hours highly &s;en&s;ible of the Doctor's care of his unhappy boy; and earne&s;tly
<PB N="354" REF="355">
de&s;ired his Lady to &s;ee him hand&s;omely rewarded for his trouble. But not making a will: and the Lady having, by her early over-indulgence, ruined the mo|rals of her child (never &s;uffering him to be either cor|rected or chidden, were his enormities ever &s;o flagrant) &s;he bore a &s;acred grudge to the Doctor for his hone&s;t repre&s;entations to her Lord of the young man's im|moralities: And not even the interpo&s;ition of a Sir Charles Grandi&s;on has hitherto been able to procure the lea&s;t acknowledgment to the Doctor; though the lo&s;s as well, of his reputation, as life, might have been the con&s;equence of the faithful &s;ervices he had endea|voured to render to the profligate youth, and in him to the whole family."</Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII. Dr. <HI>BARTLETT.</HI> In Continuation. [Inclo&s;ing the preceding.]</HEAD>
<P>THUS far, dear Mi&s;s Byron (delight of every one who is &s;o happy as to know you!) reach my kin&s;man's extracts from my papers. I will add &s;ome particulars in an&s;wer to your enquiries about Mr. Beauchamp, if writing of a man I &s;o greatly love, I can write but a few.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp is a fine young man in his per&s;on: When I call him a &s;econd Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, you and the Ladies, and my Lord L. will conceive a very high idea of his under&s;tanding, politene&s;s, and other amiable qualities. He is of an ancient family. His father, Sir Harry Beauchamp, tenderly loves him, and keeps him abroad equally again&s;t both their wills; e&s;pecially again&s;t Mr. Beauchamp's, now his beloved friend is in England. This is done to humour an imperious, vindictive woman, who, when a widow, had ca&s;t her eyes upon the young gentleman for a
<PB N="355" REF="356">
hu&s;band; imagining, that her great wealth (her per|&s;on not di&s;agreeable) would have been a temptation to him. This, however, was unknown to the father; who made his addre&s;&s;es to her much about the time that Mr, Beauchamp had given an ab&s;olute denial (perhaps with too little ceremony) to an overture made to him by a friend of hers. This enraged her. She was re&s;olved to be revenged on him; and knowing him to be ab&s;olutely in his father's power, as to for|tune, gave way to Sir Harry's addre&s;&s;es; and on her obtaining &s;uch terms as, in a great mea&s;ure, put both father and &s;on in her power, &s;he married Sir Harry.</P>
<P>She &s;oon gained an ab&s;olute a&s;cendant over her hu&s;band. The &s;on, when his father fir&s;t made his addre&s;&s;es to her, was allowed to &s;et out on his travels with an appointment of 600 <HI>l.</HI> a year. She never re&s;ted till &s;he had got 400 <HI>l,</HI> a year to be &s;truck off; and the remaining 200 were &s;o ill remitted, that the young gentleman would have been put to the greate&s;t difficulties, had it not been for the truly friendly a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of Mr. Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>Yet it is &s;aid, that this Lady is not de&s;titute of &s;ome good qualities, and in ca&s;es where the <HI>&s;on</HI> is not the &s;ubject, behaves very commendably to Sir Harry: But being a managing woman, and Sir Harry loving his ea&s;e, &s;he has made her&s;elf his receiver and trea&s;ur|er; and by that means has put it out of his power, to act as paternally by his &s;on as he is inclined to do, without her knowing it.</P>
<P>The Lady and Sir Harry both, however, profe&s;s to admire the character of Sir Charles Grandi&s;on, from the Letters Mr. Beauchamp has written from time to time to his father; and from the general report in his favour: And on th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">s, as well I, as Mr. Beauchamp, found our hope, that if Sir Charles, by &s;ome un|&s;u&s;pected way, can make him&s;elf per&s;onally ac|quainted
<PB N="356" REF="357">
with the Lady, he will be able to induce her to con&s;ent to her &s;on-in-law's recall; and to be reconciled to him; the rather, as there is no i&s;&s;ue by this marriage; who&s;e intere&s;ts might &s;trengthen the Lady's animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>Mr. Beauchamp, in this hope, writes to Sir Charles, that he can, and will, pay all the due re&s;pect to his father's wife, and, as &s;uch, treat her as his mother, if &s;he will con&s;ent to his return to his native country: But declares, that he would &s;tay abroad all his life, rather than his father &s;hould be made unhappy, by allowing of his coming over again&s;t the con&s;ent of &s;o high-&s;pirited a woman. In the mean time he pro|po&s;es to &s;et out from Vienna, where he now is, for Paris, to be near, if Sir Charles, who he thinks can manage any point he undertakes (and who in this, will be &s;econded by his father's love) can prevail with his mother-in-law.</P>
<P>I long, Ladies, to have you all acquainted with this other excellent young man. You, Mi&s;s Byron, I am &s;ure, in particular, will admire Sir Charles Grandi|&s;on's, and my Beauchamp: Of &s;pirit &s;o manly, yet of manners &s;o delicate&mdash;I end as I began; He is a &s;e|cond Sir Charles Grandi&s;on.</P>
<P>I &s;hall think my&s;elf, Ladies, very happy, if I can find it in my power to oblige you, by any communi|cations you would wi&s;h to be made you. But let me once more recommend it to you, Lady L. Lord L. and Mi&s;s Grandi&s;on, to throw off all re&s;erves to the mo&s;t affectionate of brothers. He will have none to you, in ca&s;es which he knows will give you plea&s;ure. And if he forbears of his own accord to acquaint you with&s; ome certain affairs, it is, becau&s;e the i&s;&s;ue of them is yet hidden from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As to Lady Olivia, mentioned to you by good Lord L. &s;he never can be more to my patron than &s;he now is.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="358">

<P>HOW is this Lucy? Let me collect &s;ome of the contents of the&s;e Letters. "If Sir Charles for|bear, of his own accord, to acquaint his &s;i&s;ters with &s;ome certain affairs&mdash;"I&s;&s;ue hidden from him&s;elf." "Engaged in &s;ome affairs at Bologna and Florence, that embarra&s;s him"&mdash;<HI>[Is,</HI> or <HI>was</HI> &s;o engaged, means the Doctor?] "Sir Charles not re&s;erved; yet re|&s;erved."&mdash;How is all this, Lucy?</P>

<P>But, dear Lucy, have you any &s;pite in you?
