<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The following poem repre&s;ents Commerce as the child of Neptune, and born on the coa&s;t of Libya in an i&s;land, celebrated in fabulous antiquity for its fruitfulne&s;s and plenty during the fir&s;t uncultivated ages, whence the new divinity is &s;uppo&s;ed to convey the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings round the world. Her birth is attended by many of the Gods, who endow her with their &s;everal gifts: among the re&s;t Apollo appoints her to be the inventre&s;s of letters; Sir I&s;aac Newton's opinion being here alluded to, that merchandize gave ri&s;e to this wonderful di&s;covery. Commerce is then de&s;cribed as making her fir&s;t appear|ance to the world among the Phoenicians, the earlie&s;t people, who exercis'd an exten&s;ive trade. From thence &s;he proceeds to vi&s;it other parts of the globe, and endea|vours to erect her principal empire at Carthage, &s;ituated in Libya, the country a&s;&s;ign'd for her nativity. Upon the de&s;truction of that city &s;he again removes from place to place; but at length, allured by the vigour and &s;ingular re&s;olution of the Dutch in throwing off the Spani&s;h yoke, &s;he takes up her re&s;idence with that inde|fatigable people. La&s;tly, by the good laws, which have been made from time to time for the encouragement of trade among us, e&s;pecially by the act of navigation, which has transferred a great part of the Dutch traf|fick to our&s;elves, &s;he is &s;uppos'd on our invitation to choo&s;e England for her chief abode, more particularly London, our principal emporium, as well as capital

city. And upon this occa&s;ion an enquiry is made, how it has come to pa&s;s, that, notwith&s;tanding the great wealth and power attending Commerce, the cour&s;e of trade &s;hould &s;o often have &s;hifted its &s;eat; and the means, conceived mo&s;t effectual to fix this wanderer here, are pointed out.</P>
