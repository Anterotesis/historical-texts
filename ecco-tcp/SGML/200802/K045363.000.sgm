<P>THE following petite piece, which is taken from Marmontel, was originally acted at Dr. Lane's Theatre, in the year 1775. It had then the good fortune of having its principal character repre&s;ented by that ac|compli&s;hed actre&s;s Mrs. Abington, who has &s;ince very frequently performed the &s;ame on Covent Garden Stage. A new candidate for fame having undertaken to appear in this very agreeable and lively part; and the piece being often called for; it has been thought proper to give the Public an opportunity of peru&s;ing in the clo&s;et what has &s;o long delighted on the &s;tage.</P>

<P>When fir&s;t I came within the&s;e walls, I found my&s;elf a &s;lave; and the thoughts of being &s;hut up for ever here, terrified me to death: my tears flowed in|ce&s;&s;antly: Solyman was moved with them, and &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to re&s;tore me to my liberty, my parents, and my country.</P>

<P>That's a poor excu&s;e.&mdash;Had the man I lov'd but a cottage, I would gladly partake it with him; would &s;ooth his vexations, and &s;often his cares: but, were he ma&s;ter of a throne, I &s;hould expect to &s;hare it with him, or he has no love for me.</P>

<L>LORD, how I tremble! every atom &s;haking.</L>
<L>What! &s;peak an Epilogue of my own making!</L>
<L>A ta&s;k for me&mdash;pre&s;umptuous and ab&s;urd&mdash;</L>
<L>But I have promis'd, and mu&s;t keep my word.</L>
<L>Yes, I did promi&s;e, with a &s;olemn face,</L>
<L>Tadare&s;s my patrons here, and &s;ue for grace;</L>
<L>For your pa&s;t favours had &s;o warm'd my heart,</L>

<L>You can a&s;&s;i&s;t me, Sir, for wit's your trade.</L>
<L>When of your epilogues I &s;peak a line,</L>
