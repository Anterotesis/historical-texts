<HEAD>SECTION I. <HI>The</HI> DESIGN.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are two Cau&s;es, e&s;&s;entially di&s;tinct, though often interwoven, by which a free State may peri&s;h. The&s;e are, <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal</HI> Violence: <HI>Inva&s;ions</HI> from Abroad, or <HI>Di&s;&s;entions</HI> at Home: The Rage of foreign <HI>War,</HI> or do|me&s;tic <HI>Faction.</HI></P>
<P>After a dangerous and exhau&s;ting War, Victory hath at length re&s;tored Peace to our bleeding Country. But in vain the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Sword of War is &s;heathed, if in Time of Peace the Poignard of <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Faction</HI> is drawn, and madly level'd by many of our Countrymen, at the Brea&s;ts of their Fellow-Subjects.</P>
<P>To prevent the fatal Con&s;equences of this deluded or deluding Spirit, is the Purpo&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay: In which the Writer will endeavour to trace the pre&s;ent State of Things to its general Foundations: By pointing out the real Ba&s;is and genuine Characteri&s;tics of true Liberty; by unma&s;|quing the Pretences, and laying open the &s;ecret <HI>Sources</HI> and di&s;tinctive <HI>Marks</HI> of <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Faction.</HI></P>
<P>As the political Principles here laid down and inforced, will be found &s;trictly connected with Religion and Morals; no Apology will be made for endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h the public Happine&s;s of Mankind on the &s;olid Ba&s;is of <HI>Virtue,</HI> which is the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Religion it&s;elf.&mdash;</HI>In this Point the Writer confirms him&s;elf on the Authority of an excellent and learned Prelate, who&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="10">
political Re&s;earches were of like Tendency. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"As the Sum of human Happine&s;s is &s;up|po&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t in the Goods of Mind, Body, and Fortune, I would fain make my Studies of &s;ome U&s;e to Mankind, with Regard to each of the&s;e three Par|ticulars; and hope it will not be thought faulty or indecent in any Man, of what Profe&s;&s;ion &s;oever, to offer his Mite to|wards improving the <HI>Manners</HI> (I will add, the <HI>Religion) Health,</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;pe|rity</HI> of his Fellow-Creatures. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Berkley</HI>'s Mi&s;c. p. 118.</NOTE>"</Q></P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Of the Nature of Civil Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;ome it will doubtle&s;s appear a &s;uperfluous Labour, to fix the true Idea of <HI>civil Liberty,</HI> in a Country which boa&s;ts it&s;elf <HI>free.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11">
Yet the Writer e&s;teems it a nece&s;&s;ary though obvious Ta&s;k: Not only that he may appeal to his Idea of it, thus e&s;tab|li&s;hed; but al&s;o, becau&s;e in the <HI>Conduct</HI> (at lea&s;t) if not in the <HI>Writings</HI> of his Countrymen, it &s;eems to have been &s;ome|times mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The <HI>natural Liberty</HI> of Man, con&s;idered merely as a &s;olitary and &s;avage Individual, would generally lead him to a full and unbounded Pro&s;ecution of all his Appe|tites. Some Savages there are, though few, who live nearly, if not altogether, in this <HI>brutal</HI> State of <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, are inadequate to their Subject: For &s;uch a State of Man is wor&s;e than that of Brutes, and in the &s;trict Sen&s;e, is al&s;o <HI>contrary</HI> to <HI>Nature.</HI> For Brutes are en|dowed with unerring In&s;tincts, which Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth not: Therefore &s;uch a &s;olitary and wretched State is &s;trictly <HI>unnatural;</HI> becau&s;e it prevents the Exertion of tho&s;e Powers, which his <HI>Nature</HI> is <HI>capable</HI> of <HI>at|taining:</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
But tho&s;e <HI>Powers Society</HI> alone can <HI>call forth</HI> into <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>Man is therefore formed for <HI>Society:</HI> That is, Man is formed for Intercour&s;e with Man: Hence, through the natural Deve|lopement of the human Powers, a Variety of new <HI>Wants,</HI> a Nece&s;&s;ity for mutual <HI>Aids</HI> and di&s;tinct <HI>Properties,</HI> mu&s;t ari&s;e: From the&s;e, a new <HI>Acce&s;&s;ion,</HI> as well as a frequent <HI>Di&s;agreement</HI> and <HI>Cla&s;hing</HI> of <HI>De&s;ires</HI> mu&s;t inevitably en&s;ue. Hence the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>curbing</HI> and <HI>fixing</HI> the <HI>De&s;ires</HI> of Man in the &s;ocial State; by &s;uch <HI>equal Laws,</HI> as may compel the <HI>Appetites</HI> of each <HI>Individual</HI> to yield to the <HI>common Good</HI> of <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>From this &s;alutary <HI>Re&s;traint, civil Li|berty</HI> is derived. Every natural De&s;ire which might in any Re&s;pect be incon&s;i&s;t|ent with the general Weal, is given up as a voluntary Tax, paid for the higher, more la&s;ting, and more important <HI>Benefits,</HI> which we reap from <HI>&s;ocial Life.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="section">
<PB N="14" REF="13">
<HEAD>SECT. III. Of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Faction.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the Nature of civil Liberty, thus delineated, the Nature of <HI>Licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> will ea&s;ily be fixed: Being indeed no other than <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Every De&s;ire carry'd into Action, which in any Re&s;pect violates tho&s;e equal Laws, e&s;tabli&s;hed for the common Benefit of the Whole."</Q></P>
<P>Thus, an <HI>unlimited Indulgence</HI> of Appe|tite, which in the <HI>&s;avage</HI> State is called <HI>natural Liberty,</HI> in the <HI>&s;ocial</HI> State is &s;tiled <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> when its immediate Object is That of <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"thwarting the Ends of civil Liberty,"</Q> is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of <HI>Faction.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Una&s;&s;i&s;ted Laws no permanent Foundation of Civil Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Remarks are obvious; and clear to every Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the common Degrees of Under&s;tanding. Let us now con&s;ider, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What are the <HI>perma|nent Foundations</HI> of civil Liberty:"</Q>That is, in other Words,  <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What are the effec|tual Means by which every Member of Society may be uniformly &s;way'd, im|pelled, or induced, to &s;acrifice his pri|vate De&s;ires or Appetites, to the Welfare of the Public."</Q>&mdash;This is a Subject, which de&s;erves a particular Elucidation, becau&s;e in our own Country, and our own Times, it &s;eems to have been <HI>much</HI> and <HI>dangerou&s;ly</HI> mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>It hath been affirmed as a fir&s;t Principle by certain Writers, and hath been artfully or weakly &s;ugge&s;ted by others, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the
<PB N="16" REF="15">
coercive Power of human Laws is &s;uffi|cient to &s;u&s;tain it&s;elf: That the Legi&s;lator or Magi&s;trate hath properly no Concern with the private Opinions, Sentiments, or Operations of the Mind: And that <HI>Actions</HI> alone fall under the legal Cog|nizance of tho&s;e in Power."</Q></P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Fable of the Bees</HI> hath boldly laid down this; which, as a ruling Principle, pervades his whole Work. He profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf the Friend of Liberty: He derides private Virtue, as the Offspring of Flattery, begotten upon Pride: He di&s;cards Religion, as a political Fable; he treats the Principle of Honour, as an empty Chimera; he recommends private Vices as public Be|nefits; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fable of the Bees,</HI> pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE> and having thus level'd the whole Fabric of <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Principles;</HI> what, do you think, is the grand Arcanum of his Policy, for the Prevention of &s;uch Crimes as would indanger the Grandeur and Stability of the State? Why;&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;e|vere

Laws, rugged Officers, Pillories, Whipping-Po&s;ts, Jails, and Gibbets."</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Charity Schools.</NOTE></P>
<P>This Principle, of the Sufficiency of hu|man Laws to &s;u&s;tain their own Efficacy and Power, without Regard to the Opi|nions or Principles of Men, hath been, at lea&s;t, indirectly held forth by other Writers.</P>
<P>An Author, who although a <HI>&s;incere,</HI> was certainly an <HI>imprudent</HI> Friend of Liberty, &s;peaks in the following ambigu|ous Stile; which, if not de&s;igned to im|pre&s;s the Principle here called in Que&s;tion, is at lea&s;t very liable to be interpreted into it. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"It is fooli&s;h to &s;ay, that Govern|ment is concerned to meddle with the <HI>private Thoughts</HI> and Actions of Men, while they injure neither the Society, nor any of its Members. Every Man is in Nature and Rea&s;on, the <HI>Judge</HI> and <HI>Di&s;|po&s;er</HI> of his own <HI>dome&s;tic Affairs;</HI> and according to the <HI>Rules</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> and
<PB N="18" REF="17">
<HI>Equity,</HI> every Man mu&s;t carry <HI>his own Con&s;cience:</HI> So that neither has the Magi|&s;trate a Right to <HI>direct</HI> the <HI>private Be|haviour</HI> of Men; nor has the Magi&s;trate, or any Body el&s;e, any Manner of Power to <HI>model</HI> People's <HI>Speculations,</HI> no more than their <HI>Dreams.</HI> Government being intended to <HI>protect</HI> Men from the <HI>Injuries</HI> of one another, and not to direct them in <HI>their own Affairs;</HI> in which <HI>no one is intere&s;ted but them&s;elves,</HI> it is plain, that their <HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>dome&s;tic Concerns</HI> are <HI>exempted</HI> entirely from its Juri&s;dic|tion: In Truth, Men's <HI>Thoughts</HI> are not &s;ubject to <HI>their own Juri&s;diction."</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes"><HI>&mdash;"Let People alone,</HI> and they will <HI>take Care of them&s;elves,</HI> and do it <HI>be&s;t:</HI> And if they do not, a &s;ufficient <HI>Puni&s;hment</HI> will <HI>follow</HI> their <HI>Neglect,</HI> without the <HI>Magi&s;trate's Interpo&s;ition</HI> and <HI>Penalties.</HI> It is plain, that &s;uch bu&s;y Care and offi|cious <HI>Intru&s;ion</HI> into the <HI>per&s;onal Affairs,</HI> or <HI>private Actions, Thoughts,</HI> and <HI>Imagina|tions</HI> of Men, has in it more <HI>Craft</HI> than

<HI>Kindne&s;s:&mdash;</HI>To <HI>quarrel</HI> with any Man for his <HI>Opinions, Humours,</HI> or the Fa&s;hion of his Cloaths, is an <HI>Offence</HI> taken without being given."</Q>&mdash;<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"True and impartial Li|berty is therefore the Right of every Man, to pur&s;ue the <HI>natural, rea&s;onable,</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> Dictates of his own Mind: To <HI>think what he will,</HI> and <HI>act as he thinks,</HI> provided he <HI>acts not</HI> to the <HI>Pre|judice</HI> of another. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cato</HI>'s Letters, No. 62.</NOTE>"</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions are crude, inaccurate, and ambiguous; leaving the thoughtful Reader at a Lo&s;s for the Author's preci&s;e and determined Meaning. For, fir&s;t, they may po&s;&s;ibly imply, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the Magi&s;trate hath no Right to violate the Laws of what is commonly called <HI>religious Tole|ration</HI> or <HI>chri&s;tian Liberty;</HI> but that every Man hath an unalienable Right to wor|&s;hip God in that <HI>Manner</HI> which accords to the Dictates of his own Con&s;cience."</Q>&mdash;In this Sen&s;e they are rational and true:

And to this Truth the Writer hath more than once born public Te&s;timony. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. of Sermons, Serm. 4, 5, 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>But, &s;econdly, they may imply, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that Thoughts, Speculations, Opinions, Prin|ciples, however received and imbibed by the Mind of Man, have no Connexion with his Actions; at mo&s;t, no Con|nexion &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and &s;trong as to give the Magi&s;trate a Right to <HI>regulate</HI> them by <HI>any Means</HI> whatever. That no Di|rection is to be given either to the <HI>grown</HI> or the <HI>infant Mind;</HI> that as every Member of Society hath a Right to hold what Opinions and Principles he plea|&s;eth, &s;o he hath the &s;ame Privilege to communicate them to his <HI>Family</HI> and <HI>Children:</HI> That they are to think what they will, becau&s;e Thoughts and Opi|nions are a private and per&s;onal Affair: That the Magi&s;trate is only concerned to regulate their Actions."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="22">
This is not only a po&s;&s;ible Interpretation, but in all Appearance, the more natural of the two. For it is not here once &s;ug|ge&s;ted by this Author, that <HI>Opinions</HI> have any <HI>Influence</HI> on <HI>Actions;</HI> but rather, that they concern <HI>nobody</HI> but <HI>Him</HI> who <HI>holds</HI> them. 'Tis true, he &s;peaks of them as being <HI>rea&s;onable,</HI> and <HI>religious:</HI> But if they be the mere Re&s;ult of private and fortui|tous Thought, unaided by the Regulations of civil Policy, I &s;ee not why they may not more probably be <HI>unrea&s;onable</HI> and <HI>irreli|gious:</HI> Becau&s;e they are more likely to be model'd by <HI>ruling Appetites</HI> than <HI>rational Deduction.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame Time, it is but Ju&s;tice to this Author to &s;ay, that he certainly meant not (like the Author of the <HI>Fable of the Bees)</HI> to di&s;card all <HI>moral</HI> Principles as groundle&s;s and chimerical; whatever his Intentions were with Regard to <HI>Religion.</HI> But his Expre&s;&s;ions are <HI>ambiguous,</HI> and have been laid hold of by Men of the mo&s;t libertine Opinions: Therefore in
<PB N="22" REF="23">
whatever Sen&s;e they were <HI>written,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e them, in that Sen&s;e in which they have been <HI>received.</HI></P>
<P>And farther, this is certain: That the Principle implied in this &s;econd Interpreta|tion hath pa&s;&s;ed into a general Maxim in this Kingdom, among tho&s;e who pique them&s;elves on <HI>unlimited Freedom</HI> of <HI>Thought.</HI> The&s;e Men have long and openly derided every <HI>Regulation</HI> of <HI>Opinion</HI> and <HI>Principle;</HI> have di&s;carded all <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>religious In|&s;truction,</HI> under the de&s;pi&s;ed Idea, of <HI>Pre|judice of Education;</HI> have laid it down as their fundamental Maxim, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that you are to think what you will: Only to act ho|ne&s;tly."</Q> Not attending to that e&s;&s;ential Connexion which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between <HI>Thoughts, Opinions, Principles,</HI> and ACTIONS.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s, any Society of Men, aiming at the E&s;tabli&s;hment of civil Liberty, have a Right to unite them&s;elves on what Con|ditions they plea&s;e. But it is the Purpo&s;e of this E&s;&s;ay, to prove, by Rea&s;onings confirmed by Facts, that a free Commu|nity
<PB N="23" REF="24">
built on the Maxims above delivered, cannot be of <HI>long Duration:</HI> That the mere <HI>coercive Power</HI> of <HI>human Laws</HI> is not &s;uf|ficient to <HI>&s;u&s;tain it&s;elf:</HI> That there is a &s;trong and unalterable <HI>Connexion</HI> between <HI>Opinions</HI> and <HI>Actions:</HI> That a certain <HI>Regu|lation</HI> of Principles is nece&s;&s;ary to check the &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions of Man; and prevent <HI>Liberty</HI> from degenerating into <HI>Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s:</HI> And that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a certain Sy&s;tem of Manners and Principles, mutually &s;up|porting each other, and pervading the whole Community, are the only perma|nent Foundation on which true civil Li|berty can ari&s;e."</Q></P>
<P>The natural Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions, and De&s;ires of Man, are the univer&s;al Foun|tain of his Actions: Without the Impul&s;e which he receives from <HI>tho&s;e,</HI> he would be at once unfeeling and inactive. Con&s;e|quently, according to the State and Cha|racter of his De&s;ires, his Actions will <HI>natu|rally</HI> be good or evil; innocent, u&s;eful, or de&s;tructive.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="25">
Were the&s;e De&s;ires univer&s;ally coincident with the Welfare and Happine&s;s of others, no coercive Power would be wanting, as the Means of producing and &s;ecuring perfect Liberty.</P>
<P>But the acknowledged Nece&s;&s;ity of penal Laws affords an inconte&s;table Proof, that the <HI>unbridled De&s;ires</HI> of Man are utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Welfare and Happi|ne&s;s of his Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>Whatever Means, therefore, are mo&s;t effectual in curbing and <HI>&s;ubduing</HI> the &s;elfi&s;h <HI>De&s;ires</HI> of Man, are the mo&s;t effec|tual Means of <HI>regulating</HI> his <HI>Actions,</HI> and e&s;tabli&s;hing civil Liberty on its mo&s;t per|manent Foundations.</P>
<P>The mere coercive Power of human Laws, without an a&s;&s;i&s;tant Regulation of the Pa&s;&s;ions and De&s;ires, is utterly inade|quate to the great Ends either of <HI>private</HI> Happine&s;s or <HI>public</HI> Liberty.</P>
<P>It cannot produce <HI>private</HI> Happine&s;s to the Individual, becau&s;e while it leaves his Mind open to be <HI>infe&s;ted</HI> by every <HI>unruly</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="26">
<HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> that may ari&s;e, it <HI>forbids</HI> him the <HI>Gratification:</HI> Thus it &s;ets the di&s;tracted Soul at Variance with it&s;elf. The be&s;t Con&s;equence that can be hoped for, is a continued Conflict of <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Appetite;</HI> of a <HI>Dread</HI> of human <HI>Laws,</HI> warring with inordinate and <HI>&s;el&s;i&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be a <HI>permanent</HI> Foundation of public Liberty; becau&s;e while the Pa&s;&s;ions are thus left without an inward Controul, they will often be too &s;trong for <HI>Fear,</HI> even where a legal Puni&s;hment is the cer|tain Con&s;equence: For as they are &s;uffered to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in their full Vigour, and when kindled in the Soul are blind and head|long, they will often carry away the whole Man; will bear him down in their Gratification, even to unavoidable De|&s;truction.</P>
<P>Still farther, and chiefly: Human Power cannot penetrate the &s;ecret Rece&s;&s;es of the Soul, nor reach the dark Intentions of the Heart of Man, nor always be of Weight to combat the Strength of Indi|viduals:

<HEAD>SECT. V. Virtuous Manners and Principles the only permanent Foundation of civil Liberty.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT, then, are the <HI>permanent Foun|dations,</HI> on which perfect Liberty can ari&s;e?&mdash;I an&s;wer, it can only ari&s;e on the Power of &s;uch a Sy&s;tem of <HI>Man|ners</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> effectually impre&s;&s;ed on the human Mind, as may be an <HI>in|ward Curb</HI> to every inordinate De&s;ire; or rather, &s;uch as may &s;o frame and model the Human Heart, that its ruling De&s;ires
<PB N="27" REF="28">
may corre&s;pond, coincide, or coale&s;ce, with all the great and e&s;&s;ential Appoint|ments of public Law.</P>
<P>The Nature of Man admits of this Im|provement, though not in a perfect, yet in a con&s;iderable Degree. He is born with Appetites &s;uited to his own Pre&s;er|vation, and the Continuance of his Spe|cies: Beyond this, he is by Nature at once <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> and <HI>&s;ocial; compa&s;&s;ionate</HI> and <HI>re&s;entful; docile,</HI> either to <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil;</HI> and hence, capable of acquiring <HI>new Ha|bits,</HI> new Pa&s;&s;ions, new De&s;ires, either to the <HI>Welfare</HI> or <HI>De&s;truction</HI> of his Fellow-Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>Virtuous Manners</HI> I call &s;uch acquired Habits of Thought and corre&s;pondent Action, as lead to a &s;teady Pro&s;ecution of the general Welfare.</P>
<P><HI>Virtuous Principles</HI> I call &s;uch as tend to confirm the&s;e Habits, by &s;uperinducing the Idea of <HI>Duty.</HI></P>
<P>Virtuous Manners are a permanent Foundation for civil Liberty, becau&s;e they
<PB N="28" REF="29">
lead the Pa&s;&s;ions and De&s;ires them&s;elves to coincide with the Appointments of public Law. The infant Mind is preg|nant with a Variety of Pa&s;&s;ions: But it is in the Power of tho&s;e who are in|tru&s;ted with the Education of Youth, in a con&s;iderable Degree, to determine the Bent of the na&s;cent Pa&s;&s;ions; to fix them on &s;alutary Objects, or let them loo&s;e to &s;uch as are pernicious or de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>Here, then, lie the fir&s;t Foundations of civil Liberty: In forming the Habits of the youthful Heart, to a <HI>Coincidence</HI> with the <HI>general Welfare:</HI> In checking every ri&s;ing Appetite that is contrary to This, and in forwarding every Pa&s;&s;ion that may promote the Happine&s;s of the Community: In implanting and improv|ing Benevolence, Self-Controul, Humility, Integrity, and Truth; in preventing or &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the contrary Habits of Selfi&s;h|ne&s;s, Intemperance, Pride, Di&s;hone&s;ty, and Fal&s;ehood: In teaching the young Mind to <HI>delight,</HI> as far as is po&s;&s;ible, in
<PB N="29" REF="30">
every Virtue for its own Sake: In a Word, in &s;o forming the Plea&s;ures and Di&s;plea&s;ures of the opening Heart, that they may coale&s;ce and harmonize with the Laws of public Freedom.</P>
<P>Above all, <HI>This</HI> will give Stability to civil Liberty, if the &s;ocial Pa&s;&s;ions of In|dividuals can be &s;o far extended, as to include the Welfare of the <HI>whole</HI> Com|munity, as their <HI>chief</HI> and <HI>primary</HI> Ob|ject. This Affection is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name of <HI>public Spirit,</HI> or the <HI>Love</HI> of our <HI>Country;</HI> the highe&s;t Pa&s;&s;ion that can &s;way the human Heart, con&s;idered as a permanent Foundation of true Liberty.</P>
<P>But in &s;ome Minds the &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;trong, and the &s;ocial ones weak or wanting: And in the be&s;t formed Heart incidental Temptations may ari&s;e, and overturn its pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed Habits: There|fore it is a nece&s;&s;ary Mea&s;ure for the Se|curity of private Virtue and public Free|dom, that <HI>virtuous Principles</HI> be likewi&s;e implanted in the Heart. Such Principles,
<PB N="30" REF="31">
I mean, as may <HI>&s;trengthen</HI> the good Ha|bits of Thought and Action already con|tracted, by &s;uperinducing the Idea of <HI>Duty.</HI></P>
<P>Of the&s;e there are but <HI>three,</HI> which can &s;way the Manners of Men, and confirm the Foundation of civil Liberty. The&s;e are <HI>Religion, Honour,</HI> and natural <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI> The fir&s;t has the <HI>Deity</HI> for its Object; the &s;econd, the <HI>Applau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Men;</HI> the third, the <HI>Approbation</HI> of our own <HI>Heart.</HI> The Frame and Situation of Man admits of no other <HI>Principle,</HI> from whence the Idea of <HI>Duty</HI> can ari&s;e.</P>
<P>The Principle of <HI>Religion</HI> tends to this End of confirming civil Liberty, as it in|duces the Idea of <HI>Duty;</HI> and urges the Per|formance of it, on the Belief of a ju&s;t, omnipotent, and all-&s;eeing GOD; who approves and condemns, will reward or puni&s;h, according as our Thoughts and Actions are Good or Evil.</P>
<P>But, as the Means of rendering <HI>Reli|gion,</HI> a firm <HI>Ally</HI> and <HI>Support</HI> of <HI>Liberty,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="32">
it is nece&s;&s;ary that their <HI>Dictates</HI> &s;hould be <HI>coincident:</HI> That is, that the Thoughts and Actions which Religion pre&s;cribes as Duties, and forbids as Sins, &s;hould coin|cide with the Dictates and Appointments of public Law. In free Countries, this is the natural State of Religion; which commonly either bends to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of the Community, or moulds them into its own Genius and Complexion.</P>
<P>The Principle of <HI>Honour</HI> affords a con|comitant Support of civil Liberty, when properly directed. It works by a power|ful and univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"our Fondne&s;s for the Applau&s;e of Men:"</Q> But in free Countries, this Principle is much more liable to abu&s;e than that of Religion: Becau&s;e it is apt be be warped by the fa&s;hionable and ruling Manners of the Times: For whatever is fa&s;hionable is apt to draw Re&s;pect and Applau&s;e: Whatever is unfa&s;hionable is for the pre&s;ent intitled only to Contempt. Hence the Principle of <HI>Honour</HI> becomes <HI>fluctuating</HI> and <HI>uncer|tain</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="33">
in its Nature, and therefore in its <HI>Effects:</HI> A <HI>Regulation</HI> of this Principle, therefore, is of the mo&s;t important Con|&s;equence; becau&s;e, if left to its own fan|ta&s;tic Dictates, it will often <HI>endanger</HI> in|&s;tead of <HI>&s;trengthening</HI> the Foundations of public Freedom.</P>
<P>The third Principle, that of natural <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> which tends to confirm the E&s;tabli&s;hment of Liberty, is founded in the Approbation of our own Heart. This Principle is in one Re&s;pect independent on the other two, but in another Re&s;pect &s;eems to &s;tand intimately related to them. It is independent of them, as it neither looks out for the Approbation of God, nor the Applau&s;e of Men: It &s;eems inti|mately related to them, becau&s;e on a &s;trict Examination of the human Frame, as well as the Hi&s;tory of Mankind, it ap|pears generally to be the Re&s;ult of the <HI>one,</HI> or <HI>other,</HI> or <HI>both.</HI> We tran&s;plant the acknowledged <HI>Approbation</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> and the <HI>Applau&s;e</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> into our own <HI>Heart;</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="34">
and from this, through the fertile Power of <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> &s;prings a new Principle of <HI>Self-Approbation</HI> and <HI>Self-Reproof,</HI> as an additional <HI>Regulator</HI> of our Thoughts and Actions.</P>
<P>'Tis true, many Writers have re&s;olved the <HI>particular</HI> Dictates of natural Con&s;ci|ence into an <HI>unchangeable</HI> Principle of Right and Wrong, ari&s;ing univer&s;ally in the human Heart. There is no Doubt, but the <HI>general</HI> Principle of Self-Appro|bation or Self-Rebuke ari&s;eth in an <HI>uni|ver&s;al</HI> Manner, in &s;ome Degree or other: But as it appears from the Hi&s;tory of human Nature, that the <HI>particular</HI> Dic|tates of this Con&s;cience <HI>vary</HI> with the other received Principles of the Mind, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to debate or dwell on this &s;peculative Point: We may take it as a Truth confirmed by Facts, that the <HI>particular</HI> Dictates of natural <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> will generally be founded on tho&s;e of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
Hence, then, it appears, that this Prin|ciple of Con&s;cience &s;tands in Need of a <HI>Guide,</HI> in the &s;ame Degree as tho&s;e Prin|ciples on which it is founded. If it be founded on the <HI>Religion</HI> of a free State, it will generally <HI>coincide</HI> with the Prin|ciples of <HI>Freedom:</HI> If its Foundations are laid in the mere Principle of <HI>Honour,</HI> its Dictates will be <HI>fanta&s;tic</HI> as tho&s;e of its Parent; and will therefore require a pa|rallel <HI>Regulation.</HI></P>
<P>Each of the&s;e Principles, &s;ingly taken, is of Power, in <HI>&s;ome</HI> Degree or other, to &s;trengthen the Ba&s;is of civil Liberty. On their <HI>united</HI> Influence, added to the Force of pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed Habits of Thought and Manners, public Freedom might &s;eem to ari&s;e on immoveable and everla&s;ting Foun|dations.</P>
<P>But as the Nature of Man, even in his mo&s;t virtuous State, is <HI>imperfect</HI> and <HI>in|con&s;i&s;tent;</HI> &s;o, in Spite of the mo&s;t &s;alutary In&s;titutions, &s;ome <HI>Defects</HI> will intrude. Hence, from an unavoidable Alloy of
<PB N="35" REF="36">
Vice, civil Liberty mu&s;t ever be <HI>imper|fect:</HI> A certain Degree of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s (that is, of private Will, oppo&s;ing the Public) will always mix it&s;elf, and in &s;ome Degree contaminate the Purity of every Commonwealth.</P>
<P>Yet, while virtuous Manners and Prin|ciples clearly predominate in their Effects, a State may &s;till be ju&s;tly called <HI>free.</HI></P>
<P>But in Proportion as the&s;e Manners and Principles decay, and their Contraries ri&s;e into Power and Action, public Freedom mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily decline. For in that Ca&s;e, the Pa&s;&s;ions and Powers of the human Mind are all &s;et in Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Dictates of public Law. Hence un|bridled Pa&s;&s;ions will have their Cour&s;e; every Man's Heart and Hand will be &s;et again&s;t his Brethren; and the general Cement of Society, which bound all to|gether, being thus di&s;&s;olved; even with|out any external Violence offered, the Commonwealth through its <HI>internal Cor|ruption</HI> mu&s;t fall in Pieces.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI. An Objection con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>DOubtle&s;s, it will be objected (nay, it <HI>hath</HI> been objected) by the Patrons of unlimited Freedom of Thought, that This is indeed a Sy&s;tem of <HI>Slavery;</HI> that it is building civil Liberty on the <HI>Servi|tude</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> and &s;hackling the in|fant Soul with <HI>early Prejudice.</HI></P>
<P>In An&s;wer to this plau&s;ible Objection, the Writer replies (what he hath el&s;e|where advanced <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sermons on Education, &amp;c. p. 62, &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That a Prejudice doth not imply, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed, the Fal&s;ehood of the Opinion in&s;tilled, but only that it is taken up, and held, without its proper Evidence.

<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
Farther: The infant Mind cannot re|main in a State of Indifference and In|action, either with Regard to Habits of Conduct, or Principles and Opinions. Ha|bits, Impre&s;&s;ions, Beliefs, Principles, of one Kind or other, the growing Mind will inevitably contract, from its Communica|tion with Mankind: If therefore rational Habits and Principles be not infu&s;ed, in order to preclude Ab&s;urdities; it is Odds, but Ab&s;urdities will get the Start, and preclude all rational Habits and Opi|nions. The Pa&s;&s;ions and the Rea&s;on of a Child will put them&s;elves in Action, however wretched and incon&s;i&s;tent; in the &s;ame Manner, as his Limbs will make an Effort towards <HI>walking,</HI> however awk|ward and ab&s;urd. The &s;ame Objection, therefore, that lies again&s;t in&s;tilling &s;a|lutary Habits and Principles, will ari&s;e again&s;t teaching him to <HI>walk erect:</HI> This being indeed a Violation of the natural <HI>Freedom</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> as the other is of the natural <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Pa&s;&s;ions and
<PB N="38" REF="39">
the <HI>Mind.</HI> The Con&s;equences, too, are of the &s;ame Nature: For &s;ure, a Child left to the Direction of his own Appetites and Rea&s;on would &s;tand the &s;ame Chance to grovel in Ab&s;urdities, as to crawl on Hands and Knees, and wallow in the Mire.</P>
<P>Neither is there any Difference, with Re&s;pect to the real and internal Freedom of the Mind, between <HI>Opinions in&s;tilled,</HI> and <HI>Opinions caught by Accident.</HI> For in Truth, the Mind cannot be <HI>compelled</HI> to receive any Habit of Thought, Principle, or Opinion. The&s;e may indeed be offered to the infant Mind, but the Reception of them is its own voluntary Act; and is e|qually &s;o, whether they be pre&s;ented by fortuitous Incidents, or de&s;igned In&s;truc|tion. All the Difference is, that in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e &s;uch a Sy&s;tem of Habits and Opinions will certainly ari&s;e, as tend to the De&s;truction of Society: In the &s;econd, &s;uch a Sy&s;tem of Habits and Opinions may be infu&s;ed into the free Mind, as

<P>Nay, if any Difference could ari&s;e, with Re&s;pect to the true <HI>Freedom</HI> of the <HI>Mind;</HI> &s;urely, <HI>That Mind</HI> ought, in the Eye of Rea&s;on, to be adjudged <HI>mo&s;t free,</HI> which adopts a Sy&s;tem of Thought and Action, founded on the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the agreeing <HI>Society;</HI> rather than <HI>That</HI> which is &s;uf|fered to be incurably tainted with the <HI>vague</HI> and <HI>random</HI> Conceptions of <HI>untu|tor'd Infancy.&mdash;</HI>This, at le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t, is con&s;o|nant with the old Stoic Principle, that <Q REND="inline">"The wi&s;e Man alone is free. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Solus Sapiens liber.</NOTE>"</Q></P>
<P>Much hath been &s;aid in our Times, indeed, concerning the Force of <HI>una&s;&s;i&s;ted</HI> human <HI>Rea&s;on:</HI> The Writer would not willingly either flatter or degrade its Powers. But to Him it appears, that they are &s;uperficially informed of the Frame and Tenor of the human Mind, who think that <HI>mere Rea&s;on</HI> (as it exi&s;ts in Man) is more than a Power of di&s;|cerning
<PB N="40" REF="41">
and chu&s;ing the <HI>propere&s;t Means</HI> for obtaining his <HI>de&s;ired Ends,</HI> whether the&s;e Ends be <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil.</HI> The Pa&s;|&s;ions, pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed Habits, and infu&s;ed Principles of the Soul are the univer&s;al Motives to human Action. Where the&s;e point not to an <HI>End de&s;ired,</HI> Rea&s;on may indolently exerci&s;e its Eye; but can never find nor create an Object, of Force &s;uf|ficient to put the Powers of the Soul and Body in Motion. Hence, human Rea&s;on mu&s;t always receive its particular Ca&s;t and Colour from the pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed Pa&s;|&s;ions, Habits, and Principles; will ever form its ruling Ideas of Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t, from the&s;e great Fountains of human Action.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of human Nature con|firms this Truth: Hence it is, that this boa&s;ted human Rea&s;on is indeed &s;o poor and unprofitable a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; being warped and moulded into that particular Form, which the varying Accidents of Cli|mate, Soil, e&s;tabli&s;hed Manners, Religion,

Policy, bodily Frame, or prevailing Pa&s;|&s;ions and Principles, chance to give it.</P>
<P>Hence, then, it appears, that the private Freedom of the infant Mind is not <HI>vio|lated</HI> but only <HI>directed</HI> to its <HI>be&s;t End,</HI> by early and &s;alutary In&s;truction. Hence it appears to be the proper De&s;tination of Man, that he &s;hall not be left to the Fol|lies of his own weak Under&s;tanding and na&s;cent Pa&s;&s;ions; that he &s;hall not be left <HI>fortuitou&s;ly</HI> to imbibe the Maxims of corrupt Times and Manners; Maxims which, &s;etting a&s;ide all Regard to their &s;peculative Truth or Fal&s;ehood, do lead to the Di&s;&s;olution of Law and Freedom: But that he &s;hall be conducted voluntarily to adopt tho&s;e Habits and Principles, which have been con&s;ecrated by the Approba|tion of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Men, in every Age and Nation; &s;uch, in particular, as are &s;uitable to the Laws, the Cu&s;toms, the Genius, of his own free Country; &s;uch, in a Word, as are a <HI>&s;ecure Foun|dation</HI> of <HI>public Liberty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. A Confirmation of the&s;e Principles, drawn from the Hi&s;tory of free States.</HEAD>

<P>THESE Rea&s;onings, founded on the Nature and Con&s;titution of Man, will receive a &s;trong and unan&s;werable Con|firmation from the Hi&s;tory of free States. Hence we &s;hall obtain the cleare&s;t Evi|dences of Fact, that while virtuous Man|ners and Principles retained their Efficacy and Power, civil Liberty remained un|&s;haken: That as the&s;e decayed, Liberty declined: That as &s;oon as the&s;e were lo&s;t, Liberty was no more; Licentiou&s;ne&s;s crept in; Faction triumphed; and overwhelmed the&s;e degenerate States in one common Ruin.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e I &s;hall briefly analyze the Genius of the three mo&s;t eminent
<PB N="43" REF="44">
<HI>Republics</HI> that are recorded in Story: Tho&s;e of SPARTA, ATHENS, and ROME. The Events are &s;ufficiently known to tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant in ancient Hi&s;tory: But the fundamental and leading <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> of the&s;e Events de&s;erve a particular Inve&s;|tigation: They will form a concurrent Proof of the Principles here given.</P>
<P>The Republic of SPARTA claims the fir&s;t Place; both on Account of its Antiquity, and Perfection. By its Perfection is meant, not the moral Perfection of its <HI>particular In&s;titutions,</HI> but of the <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> by which <HI>The&s;e</HI> In&s;titutions were &s;ecured.</P>
<P>The leading In&s;titutions which LYCUR|GUS fixed as the E&s;&s;ence of his Common|wealth, were the&s;e which follow.</P>
<P>1. He e&s;tabli&s;hed a Senate of <HI>twenty-eight,</HI> as an <HI>intermediate Power</HI> between that of <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>People...</HI> 2. He made an equal Partition of Lands and Goods, among the free Members of the Community... 3. He introduced the U&s;e of Iron Money, in&s;tead of Gold and Silver... 4. He bani&s;hed or
<PB N="44" REF="45">
prevented all the Arts of Commerce, Ele|gance, and Luxury... 5. He ordained, that all the Members of the Society &s;hould eat together, and partake alike of the &s;ame coar&s;e Fare... 6. He e&s;tabli&s;hed an occa&s;ional Community of Wives: So that a Wife was not &s;o much the Pro|perty of her Hu&s;band, as of the Repub|lic, to the End of Population... 7. With a parallel View, he ordained a Kind of Community of Children: By This, no Father had the Care of his own Child; which, on its Birth, was immediately de|livered over to the Officers of the State; and was either pre&s;erved or de&s;troyed ac|cording to their Decree... 8. A conti|nued Attention to the Pre&s;ervation of the State, and an unremitted Preparation and Readine&s;s for defen&s;ive War, formed the chief Employment of the <HI>Spartan</HI> State... 9. He committed the Cultivation of their Lands to a large Body of Slaves, who dwelt in the &s;urrounding Country, were deprived of all the natural Rights
<PB N="45" REF="46">
of Men, and were often laid in Wait for, and butchered in cold Blood by the young Men of SPARTA. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Enormity, practi&s;ed with Impunity by the young Men of Sparta, hath been held unaccountable: But &s;eems to have been allowed on the &s;ame warlike Principle with That other Allowance <Q REND="inline">"of &s;tealing Vic|tuals."</Q> Both were probably e&s;tabli&s;hed as the Means of preparing them for the Exerci&s;e of <HI>Stratagem</HI> in War.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e were the public and e&s;&s;ential In|&s;titutions of the Spartan Republic: Many of them &s;trange in their Nature: Yet formed for long Duration, through the Means and Principles on which they were e&s;tabli&s;hed: Which we &s;hall find to be con&s;i&s;tent with, and corroborative of the Principles of civil Liberty above laid down.</P>

deepe&s;t and mo&s;t effectual Manner, by the Mode of <HI>Education</HI> which he pre|&s;cribed to the <HI>Spartan</HI> Youth.</P>
<P>No Father had a Right to educate his Children according to the Caprice of his own Fancy. They were delivered to pub|lic Officers, who initiated them early in the Manners, the Maxims, the Exerci&s;es, the Toils, in a Word, in all the mental and bodily Acquirements and Habits, which <HI>corre&s;ponded</HI> with the <HI>Genius</HI> of the <HI>State.</HI> Family Connexions had no Place: The fir&s;t and leading Object of their Af|fection, was the general Welfare.

<P>The&s;e &s;evere Manners were confirmed by all the Principles that could &s;trengthen them in the Mind of Man.</P>
<P>The Principle of <HI>Religion</HI> laid at the very Foundation of the State: For LY|CURGUS expre&s;sly modeled his Common|wealth on the Pretence of a divine Au|thority.

Now this &s;eems to be fairly weighed down by the internal Evidence ari&s;ing from the Na|ture of the E&s;tabli&s;hment it&s;elf.

<P>The Fate of AGIS, their patriot King, confirms this Solution.

<P N="2">2. If the Argument here alledged be ju&s;t, concerning the fir&s;t In&s;titution of this

<P N="4">4. It appears, that the In&s;titutions of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Republic were admirably cal|culated for each other's Support, while

<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"But &s;uppo&s;ing an Inroad made into any one of its capital In&s;titutions, the Ruin of the Whole was inevitable."</Q> For its &s;everal Parts receiving their Strength from each other, were therefore mutually <HI>dependent;</HI> and the Whole being an au|&s;tere Contradiction to the natural Appe|tites of Man, the lea&s;t Inroad of Indul|gence naturally led on to more forcible Temptations.

<P>Yet even amid&s;t the <HI>Decays</HI> of this Re|public, the Force of a rigorous Education e&s;&s;entially mixed with the Principles of

<HI>Roman</HI> Liberty: It aro&s;e even into a fero|cious Pride of Virtue, independent of all outward Te&s;timony, which hath di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the great Names of ancient ROME, from Tho&s;e of every other People upon Earth.</P>
<P N="5">5. To the&s;e we mu&s;t add the <HI>Equality</HI> of Property, the <HI>Mediocrity</HI> of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of Life, which prevailed in early ROME; all the&s;e were the Outworks that guarded the internal Strength of Man|ners and Principles; and &s;eemed, like the In&s;titutions of SPARTA, to promi&s;e an Eternity of Freedom.</P>
<P>But in Spite of all the&s;e Foundations of civil Liberty, there were three fatal Cir|cum&s;tances, admitted into the very E&s;&s;ence of the Republic, which contained the <HI>Seeds</HI> of <HI>certain Ruin:</HI> While the <HI>Tree</HI> &s;eemed to <HI>flouri&s;h</HI> in its full Growth and Vigour, <HI>The&s;e,</HI> like <HI>Canker-Worms,</HI> lay <HI>eat|ing</HI> at the Root.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e was the Neglect of in&s;tituting public Laws, by which the
<PB N="71" REF="72">
<HI>Education</HI> of their Children might have been <HI>a&s;certained.</HI> This is ju&s;tly charged by PLUTARCH, as a capital Defect in NUMA's Legi&s;lation: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, Sect. vii.</NOTE> This Defect, when once admitted into the E&s;&s;ence of the State, could not ea&s;ily be rectify'd in &s;ucceeding Times: The Principle could only have been effectually infu&s;ed, at the general Formation of the whole Ma&s;s. In Con&s;equence of this Error in the fir&s;t Concoction, the &s;upporting Prin|ciples of Freedom were vague and fluc|tuating: For Want of this <HI>preventing</HI> Power, the incidental Vices of a Parent were naturally tran&s;mitted to his Chil|dren, and thence to future Ages. The rigorous Education of SPARTA was a &s;trong Check to the Pronene&s;s of human Nature towards Degeneracy and Corrup|tion: Through This, every incidental Vice dy'd with its fir&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: While the more lax In&s;titution of the <HI>Roman</HI> Repub|lic, &s;uffered every original Taint in Man|ners

<P><PB N="73" REF="74">
The third Principle of inevitable De|&s;truction, which &s;eems to have been in|wrought into the very E&s;&s;ence of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Republic, was the fatal Principle of <HI>Change:</HI> This is a Cau&s;e not &s;o obvious; and therefore may require a farther Inve&s;|tigation.</P>

<P>For altho' in the early Periods, when Manners were &s;imple, and concurrent Prin|ciples were &s;trong, this Spirit of <HI>Adoption</HI> was confined to Cu&s;toms that were <HI>better</HI> than their own; yet in the &s;ucceeding Pe|riods,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
when Manners grew more relaxed, and Principles were weakened, the &s;ame Spirit of <HI>Adoption</HI> opened a Door for the Admi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> that were <HI>pernicious.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Admi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Change,</HI> which in the virtuous Ages led to the <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> in &s;ucceeding Times brought on the <HI>De&s;truc|tion</HI> of the Republic.</P>
<P>The &s;agacious Romans &s;oon found the Con&s;equences of this Defect: They &s;aw, that through a Want of original, <HI>preven|tive,</HI> and &s;alutary In&s;titutions, bad Man|ners were creeping in&s;en&s;ibly on the State. Hence the Creation of the <HI>Cen&s;ors</HI> had its Ri&s;e: An Office, which immediately took Cognizance of the Manners of the <HI>Ci|tizens.</HI></P>
<P>But this high Office was ineffectual in its End; becau&s;e it had not Power univer|&s;ally to <HI>prevent, but</HI> only in Part to <HI>remedy</HI> the Evil. Hence, while <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>detected Offences</HI> only, could be puni&s;hed by the <HI>Cen&s;or,</HI> the <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> of the People were laid open to a <HI>general Cor|ruption,</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="76">
from the fatal Principle of <HI>No|velty</HI> and <HI>Adoption.</HI></P>
<P>The Danger ari&s;ing from this Principle manife&s;tly increa&s;ed with the increa&s;ing Empire: That <HI>Identity</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> of Manners and Principles, which is the Soul and Security of every free State, gave Way to Manners and Principles wholly <HI>di&s;&s;imi|lar.</HI> New Maxims of Life, new Principles of Religion and Irreligion, of Honour and Di&s;honour, of Right and Wrong, picked up indi&s;criminately among the Nations which they conquered, by Degrees infu&s;ed them&s;elves into the Heads and Hearts of the <HI>Roman</HI> Citizens.</P>
<P>Here, then, we &s;ee the original Founda|tion of all the Mi&s;ery and Ruin which en&s;ued.

<HEAD>SECT. X. How far the&s;e Facts can properly be ap|ply'd to the political State of Great Britain.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Study of Hi&s;tory be of|ten in&s;tructive and u&s;eful, yet, in one Re&s;pect, it becomes the Source of fre|quent Error, even when it is written with Impartiality and Truth. This ari&s;eth from a mi&s;taken Application of hi&s;torical Facts. Errors of this Kind are apt to creep in|to all Rea&s;onings, on every Subject, where Men and Manners are concerned: But they are liable to infect <HI>political</HI> Rea&s;on|ings, above all others.</P>
<P>As the political Intere&s;ts of Men form the principal Subject of Hi&s;tory, the Rea|&s;oner on this Subject hath Recour&s;e to Facts, as the be&s;t Support of his Ar|gument. Yet, the Politician &s;eems, of all others, mo&s;t liable to be mi&s;taken in the Application of Hi&s;tory to his own
<PB N="79" REF="80">
Purpo&s;e; becau&s;e the political Connex|ions and Intere&s;ts of Men are, above all others, <HI>complicated</HI> and <HI>various.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, as no two political Con&s;titutions were ever the <HI>&s;ame</HI> in <HI>all</HI> their Circum|&s;tances, though <HI>&s;imilar</HI> in <HI>many;</HI> &s;o, all Arguments drawn from a <HI>partial</HI> Re|&s;emblance, mu&s;t be inadequate and incon|clu&s;ive; unle&s;s when it appears, that no other Circum&s;tances took Place, by which That <HI>partial</HI> Re&s;emblance might be <HI>coun|teracted,</HI> and its Effects de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Yet, it hath been a Practice too com|mon among political Rea&s;oners, from a <HI>partial</HI> Re&s;emblance between two States, to infer a <HI>total</HI> one; and becau&s;e they have been <HI>like</HI> in <HI>&s;ome</HI> Re&s;pects, to draw Conclu&s;ions, as if they had been <HI>like</HI> in <HI>all.</HI></P>
<P>Much Caution, therefore, is nece&s;&s;ary, in the Application of hi&s;torical Facts: Without This, we &s;hall run into perpe|tual Error. Let us, then, remark &s;ome of the mo&s;t <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> Circum&s;tances, in which the Con&s;titution of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> State

differs from tho&s;e of SPARTA, ATHENS, and ROME; and then draw &s;uch Con|clu&s;ions, as may be con&s;i&s;tent with the&s;e Di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may lay it down as a funda|mental Truth generally acknowledged, that the <HI>political</HI> Con&s;titution of GREAT BRI|TAIN, in its <HI>main Outline,</HI> is <HI>better modeled</HI> than tho&s;e of SPARTA, ATHENS, or ROME. The legi&s;lative and executive Powers are more equally balanced, and more clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed. Now, if Laws could &s;upport them&s;elves, it would follow, that this political State mu&s;t <HI>therefore</HI> be of <HI>longer Duration.</HI> But as it hath been made appear, that the Duration of free States depends not &s;o much on their mere <HI>Form,</HI> as on the <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Principles</HI> which &s;upport them; &s;o, nothing can be decided concerning the <HI>Duration</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> State, from its mere <HI>external Model.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, e&s;tabli&s;hed in BRITAIN, is, in its own Nature, far
<PB N="81" REF="82">
&s;uperior to that of the&s;e ancient Com|monwealths. The ab&s;olute Perfection and glorious Attributes of the Deity; the great Principle of univer&s;al Charity; the parti|cular Duties of Man to Man, thence re|&s;ulting; the Sanctions of future Reward and Puni&s;hment; all the&s;e tend to purify and exalt the Soul, far beyond the Rites of ancient Pagani&s;m: For This, even in its be&s;t Forms, was ever built on the Hi&s;tory and Examples of deify'd Men, who&s;e Lives had often been blotted with the mo&s;t flagrant Crimes; and therefore, could never exalt the Heart of Man, be|yond this weak Principle of Elevation.&mdash;But as the <HI>Power</HI> of a <HI>Religion</HI> depends, not only on its <HI>excellent Genius,</HI> but on its being <HI>effectually impre&s;&s;ed</HI> on the Mind; &s;o, no Con&s;equence can be ju&s;tly drawn, from the mere <HI>un-apply'd</HI> Excellence of its Nature.</P>

found in that of BRITAIN. For the fir&s;t was the entire Work of a &s;ingle Legi&s;la|tor, &s;truck out at one Heat; all its In|&s;titutions con&s;piring to one End, and centering (like the Radii of a Circle) in one &s;ingle Point: To This, the outward Form of Government, the internal State of Education, of Religion, Manners and Principles, were uniformly &s;ubordinate. But at the Time of the <HI>Revolution,</HI> which was the fir&s;t Aera of BRITAIN'S Free|dom, many prior In&s;titutions and E&s;tab|li&s;hments, both in Religion and Policy, Manners and Principles, had taken Place: The&s;e had been formed on the fortuitous Events of Time; and had re&s;ulted from a Variety of contending Parties; of <HI>Power,</HI> fluctuating at different Periods, between the <HI>Kings,</HI> the <HI>Nobles,</HI> the <HI>Prie&s;thood,</HI> and the <HI>People.</HI> All the&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible for human Art to remove and new-model, without &s;haking the State to its Founda|tions: Hence, though the Form of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution, civil and religious, be of
<PB N="83" REF="84">
unrivaled Excellence; yet in its very Birth it came attended with unalterable Weak|ne&s;s.&mdash;It wanted that general Self-Con|&s;i&s;tence, that entire Unity of Parts, as well as of e&s;tabli&s;hed Habits, Manners and Principles, &s;uited to the Genius of the State, which was the very Spirit and Sup|port of the <HI>Spartan</HI> Commonwealth. In this Circum&s;tance, it appears likewi&s;e in|ferior to the <HI>Roman</HI> Commonwealth; yet, perhaps, &s;uperior to that of <HI>Athens.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Sy&s;tem of Polity and Religion, perfect in its leading Parts, but imperfectly united and &s;upported, is not upheld in its native Power (like that of SPARTA) by corre&s;pondent and effectual Rules of Education. The Fundamental Laws of our Country, the Principles and Duties of Chri&s;tianity, are indeed occa&s;i|onally explained and taught, in a certain Manner and Degree: But it is in the Power of every Private Man to educate his Child, not only without a Reverence for The&s;e, but in an ab&s;olute Contempt

of them. It is much in every Parent's Option, whether he will impre&s;s his Chil|drens Hearts with &s;uch Habits and Prin|ciples as accord to the Genius of the State, or with Impunity &s;uffer them to contract &s;uch Manners and Opinions as tend to its Di&s;&s;olution. A Circum&s;tance pregnant with Danger to this free State: For hence, Manners and Principles, its chief Support, are liable to be incurably perverted in the Heart, at that Time of Life, in which alone they can be effec|tually impre&s;&s;ed.</P>

<P>In Point of <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Ability,</HI> the Difference was great between the <HI>Nobles</HI> and the <HI>People,</HI> in the&s;e ancient States: In BRITAIN, the <HI>Nobles</HI> and the <HI>People</HI> (in their <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> Capacity) are fairly on a <HI>Level.</HI> When ALCIBIADES addre&s;&s;ed the legi&s;lative Body of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Peo|ple, he addre&s;&s;ed <HI>Coblers, Bra&s;iers, Tanners, Tent-Makers.</HI> When the People of ROME retired in Di&s;content to the &s;acred Moun|tain, they were appea&s;ed by the Fable of the <HI>Belly, Head,</HI> and <HI>Hands.</HI> A <HI>Lord</HI> of Parliament would make but a &s;orry Fi|gure,

<P>Again: In each of the&s;e ancient Re|publics, the collective Body of the <HI>Peo|ple</HI> were much of one uniform Character; being Inhabitants of the &s;ame City, and nearly on a Level with Re&s;pect to Em|ployment and Property.

The People of SPARTA were intentionally virtuous: Tho&s;e of ATHENS were corrupt: Tho&s;e of ROME were of a mixed Character. As the&s;e free States voted not by Repre&s;entatives, the Pre&s;ence of the People was nece&s;&s;ary, in all Deci&s;ions of a public Nature: Hence, &s;uch a People from their Ignorance, Wants, collective Pre&s;ence, and Pride of Power, mu&s;t ever and &s;uddenly be

<P>But the <HI>collective</HI> Body of the People of BRITAIN are of a Nature and Cha|racter le&s;s uniform, and e&s;&s;entially diffe|rent.

<P>The <HI>religious</HI> Principle of <HI>Prote&s;tant Chri&s;tianity</HI> &s;eems to have taken the Lead, even of the Love of civil Freedom.

<HEAD>SECT. XII. Of the Changes in Manners and Principles, through the &s;ucceeding Times.</HEAD>
<P>THE Acce&s;&s;ion of GEORGE the Fir&s;t &s;eemed the Aera of perfect Freedom. And if an excellent King, at the Head of an unrivaled Con&s;titution, could have &s;ecured Liberty; it had now been fixed on immoveable Foundations.</P>
<P>The Alloy of <HI>licentious Manners</HI> and <HI>contradictory Principles</HI> which had tarni&s;hed the preceding Reign, &s;till maintained their Influence: But the declared and zealous Advocates for Liberty now a&s;&s;umed the Reins of Power, and began more effectu|ally to combat tho&s;e <HI>fal&s;e Principles</HI> which were at <HI>Enmity</HI> with the <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="96">
Would to God, the&s;e intentional Friends of public Liberty had been as much the Friends of private Virtue and Religion! They would not, then, have undermined the Foundations, while they were building the Super&s;tructure of civil Freedom.</P>
<P>The Seeds of Irreligion had for &s;ome Time been privately fermenting: But they did not break forth into open Growth till about this Period.&mdash;'Tis remarkable, that BURNET, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Conclu&s;ion of his Hi&s;tory.</NOTE> enumerating the Dangers by which the State was threatened in the Year 1708, makes no Mention of <HI>Irre|ligion,</HI> as an Evil worth being obviated. But &s;oon after, this Pe&s;tilence came on, with a terrible Swiftne&s;s and Malignity.</P>
<P>The &s;lavi&s;h Principle of ab&s;olute <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> and an <HI>independent Hierarchy,</HI> were &s;till prevalent in Part, e&s;pecially among the <HI>Clergy.</HI> To combat <HI>the&s;e,</HI> and expo&s;e them to the public Contempt, cer|tain Writers were encouraged by Tho&s;e

<P>They a&s;&s;ailed <HI>Super&s;tition</HI> with &s;uch Wea|pons as de&s;troyed <HI>Religion:</HI> They oppo&s;ed <HI>Intolerance</HI> by Arguments and Ridicule which tended to &s;weep away all public <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hments:</HI> While they only aimed (perhaps) to contend for <HI>Freedom</HI> of <HI>Thought,</HI> they unwarily &s;apped the Foun|dation of all &s;alutary <HI>Principles.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Div.

<P>CATO's <HI>Letters,</HI> and the <HI>Independent Whig,</HI> among many other Tracts of le&s;s Note, &s;eem palpable In&s;tances of this Truth: The one was written in Defence of <HI>civil,</HI> the other, of <HI>religious</HI> Liberty. Yet both tended, in their general Tour, to relax tho&s;e Principles by which alone Freedom, either civil or religious, can be &s;u&s;tained: By their intemperate In&s;ults on religious In&s;titutions; by their public and
<PB N="97" REF="98">
avowed Contempt of all Opinions, Prin|ciples, (or, if you plea&s;e) Prejudices, in|&s;tilled into the infant Mind, as the nece&s;|&s;ary Regulators of human Conduct: By exalting unaided human Rea&s;on, far be|yond the Rank &s;he holds in Nature: By deba&s;ing all tho&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances which the Wi&s;dom of Ages had pre&s;cribed and con|&s;ecrated, as the nece&s;&s;ary Means of correct|ing her vague and wandering Dictates.</P>
<P>While The&s;e Authors made this ill|judged, and perhaps unde&s;igned Attack, on the Foundations of civil Liberty; others made a &s;till bolder and more fatal Inroad; and opened a wider Door for <HI>Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s,</HI> by an Attack on <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In this Li&s;t of Enemies to their Coun|try, it mu&s;t be a Mortification to every Friend of Virtue and Liberty, to find the noble Author of the <HI>Characteri&s;tics.</HI> His Morals were unblemi&s;hed, his Love of Virtue and Freedom indi&s;putable: But by confounding two Things, which he &s;aw <HI>accidently united,</HI> though in their Nature

<P>There is no Doubt, but that the cur|rent Rea&s;onings of the Times had brought him to a Habit of Belief, that all This was harmle&s;s Pa&s;time.

ruling Principle of the Times; when <HI>Opi|nions</HI> and <HI>Doctrines</HI> began to be derided as Things <HI>indifferent.</HI> The noble Writer was naturally led to embrace this grow|ing Error of the Times, by a too flat|tering Opinion which he had imbibed concerning una&s;&s;i&s;ted human Nature; as being &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to e&s;tabli&s;h the unerring Practice of Virtue, unle&s;s before|hand &s;ophi&s;ticated by &s;ervile In&s;titutions.</P>
<P>The noble Writer, indeed, attempts a Vindication of this licentious Conduct, by an Appeal to the Practice of ancient GREECE and ROME.

<P>But beyond This, a famous Mini&s;ter a&s;|&s;umed, and long held the Reins of Power. There &s;eems not the lea&s;t Foundation for the Charge laid again&s;t him by his Ene|mies, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"That his De&s;ign was to in&s;lave his Country."</Q> Neither had he any

natural Inclination to corrupt Practices: Yet he rather cho&s;e to rule by The&s;e, than to re&s;ign his Power.

Far|ther, perhaps, he judged This the only po&s;&s;ible Expedient for prolonging a <HI>Peace,</HI> which He thought <HI>nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> till Time &s;hould wear out the fal&s;e Principles, on which the expelled Family &s;till held their Influence in the Minds of the People.&mdash;From <HI>&s;ome</HI> or <HI>all</HI> of the&s;e Motives, He not only <HI>gave Way</HI> to Corruption, but <HI>encouraged</HI> it.

<P>Such is the Sum of this Gentleman's Argument: To which, the following Ob|&s;ervations are offered, as a Reply.</P>
<P>There have been two different Pictures given of <HI>Man,</HI> by different Writers, dia|metrically oppo&s;ite to each other. By &s;ome, the human Species hath been re|pre&s;ented

as a natural Society of Angels; by others, as a Crew of Devils.

<P>Were Mankind of the fir&s;t of the&s;e Characters, they would need no Law! Were they of the latter, no Law could unite or bind them. The Truth is, they are a Mixture of Both.

As the&s;e &s;ocial Pa&s;&s;ions and Regards are &s;trong or weak, frequent or uncommon; the Character of a Nation is good or bad, hone&s;t or corrupt, upright or profligate.

A Variety of Proofs hath been given of the&s;e different Degrees of moral Charac|ter, in the preceding Parts of this E&s;&s;ay. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, Sect. vii, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P>But that we may not &s;eem to build on a Principle which this Author admits not, we hear him virtually declaring all This him&s;elf in another Part of his Book. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Here <HI>He (Man)</HI> has an Opportunity given him of <HI>improving</HI> or <HI>deba&s;ing</HI> his Nature, in &s;uch a Manner as to render him&s;elf <HI>fit</HI> for a Rank of <HI>higher Per|fection</HI> and Happine&s;s; or to <HI>degrade</HI> him&s;elf to a State of <HI>greater Imperfec|tion</HI> and Mi&s;ery. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Origin of Evil, p. 93.</NOTE>"</Q> Again, he &s;peaks of a <HI>Reformation</HI> of <HI>Manners,</HI> as a Thing <HI>practicable:</HI> And recommends it, as the only Remedy for political Evil. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ib. 149.</NOTE></P>

<P>Here, then, this Maxim of the ab&s;olute and unconditional Nece&s;&s;ity of Political Corruption appears in all its Nakedne&s;s and Deformity: For it is founded on <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;uppo&s;ed incurable Wickedne&s;s of Man:"</Q> An Error too glaring to need a Confutation; and which there is &s;till the le&s;s Occa&s;ion to confute, becau&s;e this Au|thor him&s;elf admits the contrary.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVI. Of the chief and e&s;&s;ential Remedy.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the&s;e may be regarded as tempo|rary and concomitant Supports of Freedom. But the chief and e&s;&s;ential Re|medy to Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Faction, the fundamental Means of the la&s;ting and &s;e|cure E&s;tabli&s;hment of civil Liberty, can only <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"lie in a general and pre&s;cribed Im|provement of the Laws of Education."</Q></P>
<P>We have &s;een above, that upright Man|ners and Principles are the only Ba&s;is of true Liberty; that the infant Mind, if left to its own untutored Dictates, inevitably wanders into &s;uch Follies and Vices, as tend to the De&s;truction of it&s;elf and others. We have &s;een, that the early and continued Culture of the Heart can alone produce &s;uch upright Manners and Principles, as are nece&s;&s;ary to check and &s;ubdue the &s;elfi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions of the Soul; and that Li|berty
<PB N="157" REF="158">
can only ari&s;e from a general Subor|dination of The&s;e, to the public Welfare. We have &s;een the&s;e Truths confirmed, by an Appeal to the State of three famed Re|publics, which by Turns <HI>aro&s;e</HI> and <HI>fell,</HI> on the very Principles here delivered. We have &s;een the Defects, as well as Excellen|cies, of our own public Con&s;titution, both <HI>civil</HI> and <HI>religious:</HI> That its Form is excel|lent and unrivaled; but that the practical <HI>Application</HI> of this unrivaled Excellence is attended with Defects incurable: That it hath all along been inevitably counterwork|ed by Manners and Principles di&s;cordant with its Genius, and di&s;cordant with each other: That for Want of a pre&s;cribed Code of Education, to which all the Members of the Community &s;hould legally &s;ubmit, the Manners and Principles on which alone the State can re&s;t, are ineffec|tually in&s;tilled, are vague, fluctuating, and &s;elf-contradictory.</P>
<P>Nothing, then, is more evident, than that &s;ome Reform in this great Point, is
<PB N="158" REF="159">
nece&s;&s;ary, for the Security of public Free|dom. Till this be effected, in Spite of all temporary Remedies, Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Faction, tho' checked for a Time, will ever be gathering new Strength, and return|ing to the Charge with redoubled Fury.</P>
<P>This Reform, to &s;ome, may appear ea&s;y to effect: By others it will be de|rided, as wholly impracticable. Perhaps the Truth may lie between the&s;e two Opinions: To throw the Manners and Principles of a Nation into any new Chan|nel, is certainly a Work of no &s;mall Dif|ficulty.&mdash;On the other Hand, we &s;eem to have many Materials lying round us, ready to be converted into the Means of this great Work. A pure and rational Religion; a generous Sy&s;tem of Policy, founded on that Religion; Manners, tho' apparently degenerating, yet by no Means generally profligate; much true Religion, Integrity, and Honour among the <HI>middle</HI> Ranks; many In&s;tances of <HI>dome&s;tic Worth</HI> among the <HI>higher;</HI> and in Spite of the
<PB N="159" REF="160">
Temptations that &s;urround the <HI>Great,</HI> true <HI>Piety,</HI> and the <HI>moral Virtues</HI> adorning the <HI>mo&s;t exalted Station.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, without dreaming of the perfect Republic of PLATO;&mdash;and fairly acknowledging the incurable Defect of our political State, in not having a cor|re&s;pondent and adequate Code of Educa|tion inwrought into its fir&s;t E&s;&s;ence;&mdash;we may yet hope, that in a &s;econdary and inferior Degree, &s;omething of this Kind may be &s;till <HI>inlaid:</HI> It cannot have that perfect Efficacy, as if it had been originally <HI>of the Piece:</HI> Yet, if well con|ducted, it may &s;trengthen the weak Parts; and <HI>alleviate</HI> Defects, though not com|pleatly <HI>remove</HI> them.</P>
<P>Among <HI>what Ranks,</HI> in the Writer's Opinion, the&s;e <HI>Defects</HI> in <HI>Education</HI> chiefly <HI>lie,</HI> may be &s;ufficiently collected from &s;ome of the preceding Sections. But as to the mo&s;t <HI>effectual Methods</HI> of <HI>relieving</HI> the&s;e <HI>Defects,</HI> he pretends not at pre&s;ent to attempt &s;o great a Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">
This, however, he is well per&s;waded of; that till &s;omething of the Kind be attempted and performed; all the la|boured Harangues that can be given from the <HI>Bench,</HI> the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> or the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> will be of little Avail: They may tend <HI>occa|&s;ionally</HI> to <HI>obviate</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Evils</HI> of <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> but never can <HI>radically cure them.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. XXVII. The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THESE Remedies, however <HI>ju&s;t</HI> in their <HI>Nature,</HI> can only be <HI>effectual</HI> through a proper Application: And this can only lie <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"in a zealous and unfeigned Union of the <HI>Hone&s;t</HI> among all <HI>Ranks</HI> and <HI>Parties,</HI> for the <HI>Accompli&s;hment</HI> of <HI>the&s;e Ends,</HI> again&s;t the Patrons and In&s;truments of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Fac|tion."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
This Union, at fir&s;t View, &s;eems of &s;uch a Nature as could hardly need to be inforced: Yet it is frequently retarded by &s;everal Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Great,</HI> this rational Union is often counteracted by the Ties of fal&s;e Honour; a dangerous Principle, which we have already noted, as being produc|tive of Party-Rage and Faction. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, p. 92.</NOTE> This Principle, even in hone&s;t Minds, will &s;ometimes prevail over the Dictates of Re|ligion and private Virtue. On this fal&s;e Foundation, political Connexions are often maintained, in Defiance of a ju&s;t Sen&s;e of public Utility: While the unhappy Man who acts on this mi&s;taken Motive, is inwardly rent by two contrary and con|tending Powers. Severe Morali&s;ts may perhaps di&s;card &s;uch a Character from the Li&s;t of the <HI>Hone&s;t:</HI> But it &s;hould &s;eem, that he is rather an Object of Clemency than Indignation. Remove but the unhappy Prejudice from his Brea&s;t;
<PB N="162" REF="163">
And &s;uch a Character would pre&s;s for|ward among the fir&s;t, towards the <HI>Goal</HI> of <HI>public Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>Again: This rational and &s;alutary Union may be retarded by Connexions of <HI>Friend|&s;hip, Gratitude,</HI> or <HI>Blood.</HI> This Cau&s;e tends to confirm and extend the Influence of the former. <HI>Fathers, powerful Friends,</HI> and <HI>Patrons,</HI> connect them&s;elves with Par|ties, and cleave to them on a mi&s;taken Principle: <HI>Sons, obliged Friends,</HI> and <HI>De|pendents,</HI> are naturally inli&s;ted in their Party; and are rivetted in it, not only by <HI>fal&s;e Honour,</HI> but <HI>Education, Gratitude, Affection.</HI> How peculiarly unfortunate is this Circum&s;tance; that the <HI>generous Pa&s;|&s;ions</HI> &s;hould ever become the <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> of <HI>public Virtue!</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame fal&s;e Attachment to Friends, Patrons, and Relations, naturally prevails, in a certain Proportion, among the mid|dle Ranks of the Kingdom. Their In|tere&s;ts, Pa&s;&s;ions, and Prejudices, are not &s;o immediately concerned as Tho&s;e of the higher Ranks; and therefore 'tis natural
<PB N="163" REF="164">
to &s;uppo&s;e, that their mutual Attachments of mi&s;taken Honour or private Affection, will upon the Whole be more moderate and le&s;s culpable. Yet &s;till, while the&s;e fal&s;e Attachments are prevalent among the <HI>Great,</HI> the <HI>People</HI> mu&s;t in &s;ome De|gree catch the Infection, from the various Relations which they bear to their Supe|riors. Hence untractable Prejudices ari&s;e, and are maintained: While <HI>Mea&s;ures</HI> are le&s;s regarded, than the <HI>Party</HI> which <HI>adopts</HI> them.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides This, another Circum&s;tance ari&s;eth, which inevitably tends to <HI>di&s;unite,</HI> and <HI>di&s;tract</HI> the <HI>Hone&s;t</HI> among the <HI>People;</HI> even when their per&s;onal Attachments are conquered by their Integrity. Their <HI>Di&s;|per&s;ion</HI> in the Country hath already been remarked, as a Circum&s;tance worthy of At|tention. Here it meets us again, as a Cau&s;e of their frequent <HI>Di&s;union.</HI> We have &s;een how naturally (under the pre&s;ent State of Things) every factious Clamour that ri|&s;eth in the Capital, is tran&s;mitted with aggravated Circum&s;tances, through the
<PB N="164" REF="165">
whole Kingdom. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See above, Sect. xix, p. 130.</NOTE> And the People of the Villages being ea&s;y of Belief, becau&s;e not &s;u&s;pecting the abandoned Profligacy of the&s;e <HI>Town-Defamers,</HI> are apt to receive every in&s;inuated <HI>per&s;onal Slander,</HI> as a <HI>Truth.</HI> The&s;e Calumnies being &s;eldom contradicted by the injured Party, take Root in the Minds of the le&s;s knowing. Hence Doubts ari&s;e; Surmi&s;es and Di&s;|likes are &s;pread; Facts, though void of all Foundation, are alledged and per&s;i&s;ted in; the more credulous Part are mi&s;led: Thus an hone&s;t People are divided; and not only a <HI>Province</HI> or a <HI>Village,</HI> but even an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> often &s;et at Variance with|in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The&s;e Contentions <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> ari&s;e to a Degree which is ridiculous: And have for|merly been &s;o de&s;cribed <HI>without Exception,</HI> by the Tools of Faction. Notwith&s;tanding This, every Friend of Liberty ought to grieve, if a <HI>free,</HI> an <HI>hone&s;t,</HI> and a <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> PEOPLE &s;hould ever de&s;i&s;t (were it po&s;&s;i|ble)

to debate on Affairs of Government. Tho' they may be occa&s;ionally alarmed and mi&s;led on &s;light Occa&s;ions, yet their mature and collective Judgment on im|portant Subjects, will <HI>&s;eldom</HI> be <HI>erroneous.</HI> On this Foundation, MONTESQUIEU'S Re|mark is &s;olid: <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tell me not, that &s;uch a People will &s;ometimes <HI>rea&s;on ill:"</HI></Q> 'Tis &s;ufficient, <Q REND="inline">"that <HI>they rea&s;on.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">L'E&s;prit des Loix.</NOTE>"</Q></P>
<P>The Guilt and ill Con&s;equences, then, ari&s;e from the malevolent Clamours of the Capital, tran&s;mitted thence to the Provinces. The&s;e Clamours, though not of Power to &s;educe an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> PEOPLE into actual Sedition, are yet often &s;uffi|cient to <HI>alarm</HI> and <HI>divide</HI> them. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See above, Sect. xiii. p. 114.</NOTE></P>
<P>Much Caution, therefore, ought to be u&s;ed by the Inhabitants of the <HI>Country,</HI> how they give Credit to the <HI>political</HI> Ru|mours of the <HI>Town;</HI> which are &s;eldom &s;pread without De&s;ign; and are in ge|neral &s;pread mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly by the Malevolent.

<PB N="166" REF="167">
are apt to tru&s;t to the native Force of Truth: The Patrons of Fal&s;e|hood are con&s;cious of a Defect <HI>here;</HI> and therefore endeavour to &s;upply it by a mi&s;apply'd Diligence and Cunning.</P>
<P>One Mark of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Fac|tion is peculiarly applicable to the&s;e Cla|mours from the Metropolis: If they are fraught with <HI>per&s;onal Calumny,</HI> and at|tack private Characters, they a&s;&s;uredly come from the <HI>Enemies</HI> of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Freedom.</HI></P>
<P>All The&s;e, therefore, a <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> and <HI>ho|ne&s;t</HI> PEOPLE will learn to <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> and <HI>de|ride.</HI> This Foundation once laid, they will not be far from a <HI>general Union</HI> again&s;t the <HI>hidden De&s;igns</HI> of <HI>Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Faction.</HI></P>
<P>In Conclu&s;ion, therefore, let the <HI>Hone&s;t</HI> among every <HI>Rank</HI> and <HI>Party</HI> recollect; that their fir&s;t and highe&s;t Obligations are to God, their King, and Country.
