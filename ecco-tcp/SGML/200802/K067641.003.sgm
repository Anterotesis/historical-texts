THE LIVES OF THE POETS.</HEAD>

<HEAD>Sir JOHN DENHAM.</HEAD>
<P>_AN eminent poet of the 17th century, was the only &s;on of Sir John Den|ham, knight, of Little Hor&s;ley in E&s;&s;ex, and &s;ome time baron of the Exchequer in Ireland, and one of the lords ju&s;tices of that kingdom. He was born in Dublin, in the year 1615<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ath. Oxon. vol. ii.</NOTE>; but was brought over from thence very young, on his father's being made one of the barons of the Exchequer in England 1617.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5">
He received his education, in grammar learning, in London; and in Michaelmas term 1631 he was entered a gentleman commoner in Trinity College, Oxford, being then 16 years of age; where, as Wood expre&s;&s;es it, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'being looked upon as a &s;low dreaming young man, and more addicted to ga|ming than &s;tudy, they could never imagine he could ever enrich the world with the i&s;&s;ue of his brain, as he afterwards did.'</Q></P>
<P>He remained three years at the univer&s;ity, and having been examined at the public &s;chools, for the degree of bachelor of arts, he entered him|&s;elf in Lincoln's-Inn, where he was generally thought to apply him&s;elf pretty clo&s;ely to the &s;tudy of the common law. But notwith&s;tanding his application to &s;tudy, and all the efforts he was capable of making, &s;uch was his propen&s;ity to gaming, that he was often &s;tript of all his money; and his father &s;everely chiding him, and threatning to abandon him if he did not reform, he wrote a little e&s;&s;ay again&s;t that vice, and pre|&s;ented it to his father, to convince him of his re&s;olution again&s;t it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood.</NOTE>. But no &s;ooner did his fa|ther die, than being unre&s;trained by paternal autho|rity, he rea&s;&s;umed the practice, and &s;oon &s;quan|dered away &s;everal thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>In the latter end of the year 1641 he publi&s;hed a tragedy called the Sophy, which was greatly ad|mired, and gave Mr. Waller occa&s;ion to &s;ay of our author, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That he broke out like the Iri&s;h rebellion, three&s;core thou&s;and &s;trong, when no body was aware, nor in the lea&s;t expected it.'</Q> Soon after this he was pricked for high &s;heriff for the county of Surry, and made governor of Farnham-Ca&s;tle for the King; but not being well &s;killed in military affairs, he &s;oon quitted that po&s;t and retired to his Maje&s;ty at Oxford,
<PB N="3" REF="6">
where he publi&s;hed an excellent poem called Coo|per's-hill, often reprinted before and &s;ince the re|&s;toration, with con&s;iderable alterations: it has been univer&s;ally admired by all good judges, and was tran&s;lated into Latin ver&s;e, by Mr. Mo&s;es Pengry of Oxford.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden &s;peaking of this piece, in his de|dication of his Rival Ladies, &s;ays, that it is a poem, which, for the Maje&s;ty of the &s;tile, will ever be the exact &s;tandard of good writing, and the noble author of an e&s;&s;ay on human life, be&s;tows upon it the mo&s;t lavi&s;h encomium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the preface to 2d edition, 1736, 4to.</NOTE>. But of all the evidences in its favour, none is of greater authority, or more beautiful, than the following of Mr. Pope, in his Wind&s;or Fore&s;t.<Q><L>Ye &s;acred nine, that all my &s;oul po&s;&s;e&s;s,</L>
<L>Who&s;e raptures fire me, and who&s;e vi&s;ions ble&s;s;</L>
<L>Bear me, O bear me, to &s;eque&s;ter'd &s;cenes,</L>
<L>The bow'ry mazes, and &s;urrounding greens;</L>
<L>To Thames's bank which fragrant breezes fill,</L>
<L>Or where the mu&s;es &s;port on Cooper's-hill.</L>
<L>(On Cooper's hill eternal wreaths &s;hall grow,</L>
<L>While la&s;ts the mountain, or while Thames &s;hall flow.)</L>
<L>I &s;eem thro' con&s;ecrated walks to rove,</L>
<L>I hear &s;oft mu&s;ic die along the grove,</L>
<L>Led by the &s;ound, I roam from &s;hade to &s;hade,</L>
<L>By god-like poets venerable made:</L>
<L>Here his la&s;t lays maje&s;tic Denham &s;ung,</L>
<L>There the la&s;t numbers flow'd from Cowley's tongue.</L></Q></P>
<P>In the year 1647 he was entru&s;ted by the Queen with a me&s;&s;age to the King, then in the hands of
<PB N="4" REF="7">
the army, and employed in other affairs relating to his Maje&s;ty. In his dedication of his poems to Charles II. he ob&s;erves, that after the delivery of the per&s;on of his royal father into the hands of the army, he undertook for the Queen-mother, to get acce&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, which he did by means of Hugh Peters; and upon this occa&s;ion, the King di&s;cour&s;ed with him without re&s;erve up|on the &s;tate of his affairs. At his departure from Hampton-court, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The King commanded me to &s;tay privately in London, to &s;end to him and receive from him all his letters, from and to all his corre&s;pondents, at home and abroad, and I was furni&s;hed with nine &s;everal cyphers in order to it. Which I tru&s;t I performed with great &s;afety to the per&s;ons with whom we corre&s;|ponded; but about nine months after being di&s;|covered by their knowledge of Mr. Cowley's hand, I happily e&s;caped both for my&s;elf and tho&s;e who held corre&s;pondence with me.'</Q></P>
<P>In April 1648 he conveyed away James duke of York, then under the tuition of Algernon earl of Northumberland, from St. James's, and carried him into France, to the prince of Wales and Queen|mother. This circum&s;tance is related by Wood, but Clarendon, who is a higher authority, &s;ays, that the duke went off with colonel Bamfield only, who contrived the means of his e&s;cape. Not long af|ter, he was &s;ent emba&s;&s;ador to the King of Poland, in conjunction with lord Crofts, to whom he ad|dre&s;&s;es a poem written on their journey; from whence he brought ten thou&s;and pounds for his Maje&s;ty, by the decimation of his Scotti&s;h &s;ub|jects there.</P>
<P>About the year 1652, he returned into England, and was well received by the earl of Pembroke at Wilton, and continued with that nobleman a|bout a year; for his own fortune by the expence he was at during the civil war, and his uncon|querable
<PB N="5" REF="8">
itch of gaming was quite exhau&s;ted. From that year to the re&s;toration, there are no accounts of our author; but as &s;oon as his Ma|je&s;ty returned, he entered upon the office of &s;ur|veyor of his Maje&s;ty's buildings, in the room of Inigo Jones, decea&s;ed; and at the coronation of King Charles II. was created a knight of the Bath. Upon &s;ome di&s;content ari&s;ing from his &s;e|cond marriage he lo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, but &s;oon reco|vering from that di&s;order, he continued in great e&s;teem at court for his poetical writings. In the dedication of his poems to King Charles II. he tells us that he had been di&s;couraged by King Charles I. from writing ver&s;es.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'One morning (&s;ays he) when I was waiting up|on the King at Cau&s;ham, &s;miling upon me, he &s;aid he could tell me &s;ome news of my&s;elf, which was that he had &s;een &s;ome ver&s;es of mine the evening before (being tho&s;e to Sir Robert Fan|&s;haw) and a&s;king me when I made them, I told him two or three years &s;ince; he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that having never &s;een them before, he was afraid I had written them &s;ince my return into Eng|land; and though he liked them well he would advi&s;e me to write no more: alledging, that when men are young, and having little el&s;e to do, they might vent the over-flowings of their fancy that way, but when they were thought fit for more &s;erious employments, if they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in that cour&s;e, it would look as if they minded not the way to any better; whereupon I &s;tood corrected as long as I had the honour to wait upon him.'</Q> This is a &s;trong in&s;tance of his duty to the King; but no great compliment to his Ma|je&s;ty's ta&s;te: nor was the public much obliged to the Monarch for this admonition to our author.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="9">
But King Charles II. being of an humour more &s;prightly than his father, was a profe&s;&s;ed encou|rager of poetry, and in his time a race of wits &s;prung up, unequalled by tho&s;e of any other reign.</P>
<P>This monarch was particularly delighted with the poetry of our author, e&s;pecially when he had the happine&s;s to wait upon him, in Holland and Flanders; and he was plea&s;ed &s;ometimes to give him arguments to write upon, and divert the evil hours of their bani&s;hment, which now and then, Sir John tells us, he acquitted him&s;elf not much &s;hort of his Maje&s;ty's expectation.</P>
<P>In the year 1688 Sir John Denham died, at his office in Whitehall, and was interred in We&s;t|min&s;ter-Abbey, near the tombs of Chaucer, Spen|&s;er, and Cowley.</P>

<ITEM>25. Cato Major of old Age, a Poem: It is taken from the Latin of Tully, though much alter'd from the original, not only by the change of the &s;tile, but by addition and &s;ubtraction. Our author tells us, that intending to tran&s;late this piece into pro&s;e (where tran&s;lation ought to be &s;trict) &s;inding the mat|ter very proper for ver&s;e, he took the liberty to leave out what was only nece&s;&s;ary, to that age and place, and to take or add what was proper to this pre&s;ent age and occa&s;ion, by laying the &s;cene clearer and in fewer words, according to the &s;tile and car of the times.</ITEM>

In the year 1666 there were printed by &s;tealth, in octavo, certain Poems, intitled Directions to a Painter, in four copies or parts, each dedicated to king Charles the IId. They were very &s;atyrically written again&s;t &s;everal per&s;ons engaged in the Dutch war, in 1661. At the end of them was a piece enti|tled Clarendon's Hou&s;ewarming; and after that his Epitaph, both containing bitter reflexions again&s;t that earl. Sir John Denham's name is to the&s;e pieces, but they were generally thought to be written by Andrew Marvel, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Merry Droll in Charles the IId's Parliaments, but &s;o very hone&s;t, that when a mini&s;ter once called at his lodgings, to tamper with him about his vote, he found him in mean apartments up two pair of &s;tairs, and though he was obliged to &s;end out that very morning to bor|row a guinea, yet he was not to be corrupted by the mini&s;ter, but denied him his vote. The printer of the&s;e poems being di&s;covered, he was &s;entenced to &s;tand in the pillory for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>We have met with no authors who have given any account of the moral character of Sir John Denham, and as none have mentioned his virtues, &s;o we find no vice imputed to him but that of gaming; to which it appears he was immoderately addicted. If we may judge from his works, he was a good natur'd man, an ea&s;y companion, and in the day of danger and tumult, of un&s;haken loyalty to the &s;uffering in|tere&s;t

Killegrew was a man of very great humour, and frequently diverted king Charles II. by his lively &s;pirit of mirth and drollery. He was frequently at court, and had often acce&s;s to king Charles when ad|mi&s;&s;ion was denied to the fir&s;t peers in the realm. Among&s;t many other merry &s;tories, the following is related of Killegrew. Charles II. who hated bu&s;i|ne&s;s as much as he loved plea&s;ure, would often di&s;|appoint the council in vouch&s;afing his royal pre&s;ence when they were met, by which their bu&s;ine&s;s was nece&s;&s;arily delay'd and many of the council much offended by the di&s;re&s;pect thrown on them: It hap|pened one day while the council were met, and had &s;at &s;ome time in expectation of his maje&s;ty, that the duke of Lauderdale, who was a furious ungovernable man, quitted the room in a pa&s;&s;ion, and accidentally met with Killegrew, to whom he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf irreverently of the king: Killegrew bid his grace be calm, for he would lay a wager of a hundred pounds, that he would make his maje&s;ty come to council in le&s;s than half an hour. Lauderdale being a little heated, and under the influence of &s;urprize, took him at his word;&mdash;Killegrew went to the king, and without ceremony told him what had happened, and added, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I know that your maje&s;ty hates Lauder|dale, tho' the nece&s;&s;ity of your affairs obliges you to behave civilly to him; now if you would get rid of a man you hate, come to the council, for Lauderdale is a man &s;o boundle&s;ly avaritious, that rather than pay the hundred pounds lo&s;t in this wager, he will hang him&s;elf, and never plague you more."</Q> The king was plea&s;ed with the arch|ne&s;s of this ob&s;ervation, and an&s;wered, <Q REND="inline">'then Kille|grew I'll po&s;itively go,'</Q> which he did.&mdash;It is like|wi&s;e related, that upon the king's &s;uffering his mi&s;|tre&s;&s;es to gain &s;o great an a&s;cendant over him as to &s;acrifice for them the intere&s;t of the &s;tate, and neglect the mo&s;t important affairs, while, like another Sarda|napalus, he wa&s;ted his hours in the apartments of

<HEAD>Mrs. APHRA BEHN,</HEAD>
<P>A Celebrated poete&s;s of the la&s;t age, was a gentlewoman by birth, being de&s;cended, as her life-writer &s;ays, from a good family in the city of Canterbury. She was born in Charles I&s;t's reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs prefixed to her Novels, by a lady.</NOTE>, but in what year is not known. Her father's name was John&s;on, who&s;e relation to the lord Willoughby engaged him for the advantage|ous po&s;t of lieutenant general. of Surinam, and &s;ix and thirty i&s;lands, to undertake a voyage, with his whole family, to the We&s;t-Indies, at which time our poete&s;s was very young. Mr. John&s;on died at &s;ea, in his pa&s;&s;age thither; but his family arrived at Surinam, a place &s;o delightfully &s;ituated, and abounding with &s;uch a va&s;t profu&s;ion of beauties, that, according to Mrs. Behn's de&s;cription, nature &s;eems to have joined with art to render it perfect|ly elegant: her habitation in that country, called St. John's Hill, &s;he has challenged all the gar|dens in Italy, nay, all the globe of the world, to &s;hew &s;o delightful a rece&s;s. It was there our po|ete&s;s became acquainted with the &s;tory and per&s;on of the American Prince Oroonoko, who&s;e adven|tures &s;he has &s;o feelingly and elegantly de&s;cribed in the celebrated Novel of that name, upon which Mr. Southern has built his Tragedy of Oroonoko, part of which is &s;o entertaining and moving, that it is almo&s;t too much for nature. Mrs. Behn tells us, that &s;he her&s;elf had often &s;een and conver&s;ed with that great man, and been a witne&s;s to many of
<PB N="18" REF="21">
his mighty actions, and that at one time, he, and Imoinda his wife, were &s;carce an hour in a day from her lodgings; that they eat with her, and that &s;he obliged them in all things &s;he was capa|ble of, entertaining them with the lives of the Ro|mans and great men, which charmed him with her company; while &s;he engaged his wife with teaching her all the pretty works &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of, relating &s;tories of Nuns, and endeavouring to bring her to the knowledge of the true God. This intimacy between Oroonoko and Mrs. Behn oc|ca&s;ioned &s;ome reflexions on her conduct, from which the authore&s;s of her life, already quoted, ju&s;tified her in the following manner; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Here, &s;ays &s;he, I can add nothing to what &s;he has given the world already, but a vindication of her from &s;ome unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions I find are in&s;inu|ated about this town, in relation to that prince. I knew her intimately well, and I believe &s;he would not have concealed any love affair from me, being one of her own &s;ex, who&s;e friend&s;hip and &s;ecrecy &s;he had experienced, which makes me a&s;|&s;ure the world that there was no intr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gue be|tween that Prince and A&s;traea. She had a ge|neral value for his uncommon virtues, and when he related the &s;tory of his woes, &s;he might with the De&s;demona of Shake&s;pear, cry out, That it was pitiful, wondrous pitiful, which ne|ver can be con&s;trued into an amour; be&s;ides, his heart was too violently &s;et on the everla&s;ting charms of his Imoinda, to be &s;hook with tho&s;e more faint (in his eye) of a white beauty; and A&s;trea's relations there pre&s;ent kept too watchful an eye over her, to permit the frailty of her youth, if that had been powerful enough.'</Q></P>
<P>After this lady's return to London, &s;he was mar|ried to Mr. Behn, a Merchant there, but of Dutch extraction. This marriage &s;trengthening her intere&s;t, and, perhape, re&s;toring her character, gave her an op|portunity
<PB N="19" REF="22">
of appearing with advantage at court. She gave King Charles II. &s;o accurate and agreeable an account of the colony of Surinam, that he con|ceived a great opinion of her abilities, and thought her a proper per&s;on to be entru&s;ted with the management of &s;ome important affairs, during the Dutch war; which occa&s;ioned her going into Flanders, and re&s;iding at Antwerp. Here, by her political intrigues, &s;he di&s;covered the de&s;ign formed by the Dutch, of &s;ailing up the river Thames, and burning the Engli&s;h &s;hips in their harbours, which &s;he communicated to the court of England; but her intelligence, though well grounded, as appear|ed by the event, being only laughed at and &s;light|ed, &s;he laid a&s;ide all other thoughts of &s;tate af|fairs, and amu&s;ed her&s;elf during her &s;tay at Ant|werp with the gallantries in that city. But as we have mentioned that &s;he di&s;covered the de&s;ign of the Dutch to burn our &s;hips, it would be inju&s;tice to the lady, as well as to the reader, not to give &s;ome detail of her manner of doing it. She made this di&s;covery by the intervention of a Dutchman, whom her life-writer calls by the name of Vander Albert. As an amba&s;&s;ador, or negociator of her &s;ex could not take the u&s;ual means of intelligence; of mixing with the multitude, and bu&s;tling in the cabals of &s;tate&s;men, &s;he fell upon another way, perhaps more efficacious, of working by her eyes. This Vander Albert had been in love with her before her marriage with Mr. Behn, and no &s;oon|er heard of her arrival at Antwerp, than he paid her a vi&s;it; and after a repetition of his for|mer vows, and ardent profe&s;&s;ions for her &s;ervice, pre&s;&s;ed her to receive from him &s;ome undeniable proofs of the vehemence and &s;incerity of his pa&s;|&s;&s;ion, for which he would ask no reward, 'till he had by long and faithful &s;ervices convinced her that he de&s;erved it. This propo&s;al was &s;o &s;uita|ble to her pre&s;ent aim in the &s;ervice of her coun|try,
<PB N="20" REF="23">
that &s;he accepted it, and employed Albert in &s;uch a manner, as made her very &s;erviceable to the King. The latter end of the year 1666, he &s;ent her word, by a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger, that he would be with her at a day appoinced, at which time, he revealed to her, that Cornelius de Wit, who, with the re&s;t of that family, had an impla|cable hatred to the Engli&s;h nation and the hou&s;e of Orange, had, with de Ruyter, propo&s;ed to the States the expedition abovementioned. This pro|po&s;al, concurring with the advice which the Dutch &s;pies in England had given them, of the total neglect of all naval preparations, was well receiv|ed, and was re&s;olved to be put in execution, as a thing neither dangerous nor difficult. Albert hav|ing communicated a &s;ecret of this importance, and with &s;uch marks of truth, that &s;he had no room to doubt of it: as &s;oon as the interview was at an end, &s;he di&s;patched an account of what &s;he had di&s;covered, to England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoires ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But we cannot conclude Mrs. Behn's gallantries at Antwerp, without being a little more particular, as we find her attacked by other lovers, and thought &s;he found means to pre&s;erve her innocence, yet the account that &s;he her&s;elf gives of her affairs there, is both humorous and entertaining.</P>
<P>In a letter to a friend &s;he proceeds thus, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My other lover is about twice Albert's age, nay and bulk too, tho' Albert be not the mo&s;t Barbary &s;hape you have &s;een, you mu&s;t know him by the name of Van Bruin, and he was introduced to me by Albert his kin&s;man, and was obliged by him to furni&s;h me in his ab&s;ence, with what money and other things I &s;hould plea&s;e to command, or have occa&s;ion for.

I replied that I was &s;urprized to hear a friend of Albert's making an intere&s;t in me for another, and that if love were a pa&s;&s;ion, I was any way &s;en&s;ible of, it could never be for an old man, and much to that purpo&s;e. But all this would not do, in a day or two I received this eloquent epi&s;tle from him.'</Q> Here Mrs. Behn in&s;erts a tran&s;lation of Van Bruin's letter, which was wrote in French; and in a mo&s;t ridiculous &s;tile, telling her, he had often &s;trove to reveal to her the tempe&s;ts of his heart, and with his own mouth &s;cale the walls of her affec|tions; but terrified with the &s;trength of her fortifica|tions, he concluded to make more regular ap|proaches, to attack her a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> a farther di&s;tance, and try fir&s;t what a bombardment of letters would do; whether the&s;e carca&s;&s;es of love thrown into the &s;con|ces of her eyes, would break into the mid&s;t of her brea&s;t, beat down the out-guard of her aver&s;ion, and blow up the magazine of her cruelty, that &s;he might be brought to a capitulation, and yield upon rea&s;onable terms. He then con&s;iders her as a goodly &s;hip under &s;ail for the Indies; her hair is the pennants, her fore-head the prow, her eyes the guns, her no&s;e the rudder. He wi&s;hes he could once &s;ee her keel bove water, and de&s;ires to be her pilot, to &s;teer thro' the Cape of Good-Hope, to the Indies of love.</P>
<P>Our ingenious poete&s;s &s;ent him a &s;uitable an&s;wer to this truly ridiculous and Dutchman like epi&s;tle. She rallies him for &s;etting out in &s;o unprofitable a voyage as love, and humorou&s;ly reckons up the ex|pences

of the voyage; as ribbons, and hoods for her pennants, diamond rings, lockets, and pearl-neck-laces for her guns of offence and defence, &s;ilks, holland, lawn, cambric, &amp;c. for her rigging.</P>
<P>Mrs. Behn tells us &s;he diverted her&s;elf with Van Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">in in Albert's ab&s;ence, till he began to a&s;&s;ume and grow trouble&s;ome to her by his addre&s;&s;es, &s;o that to rid him&s;elf of him, &s;he was forced to di&s;clo&s;e the whole affair to Albert, who was &s;o enraged that he threatened the death of his rival, but he was pacified by his mi&s;tre&s;s, and content to upbraid the other for his treachery, and forbid him the hou&s;e, but this &s;ays Mrs. Behn, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'produced a very ridiculous &s;cene, for my Ne&s;torian lover would not give ground to Albert, but was as high as he, challenged him to &s;niker &s;nee for me, and a thou&s;and things as co|mical; in &s;hort nothing but my po&s;itive command could &s;atisfy him, and on that he promi&s;ed no more to trouble me. Sure as he thought him&s;elf of me, he was thunder-&s;truck, when he heard me not only forbid him the hou&s;e, but ridicule all his addre&s;&s;es to his rival Albert; with a countenance full of de&s;pair, he went away not only from my lodgings, but the next day from Antwerp, unable to &s;tay in a place where he had met &s;o dreadful a defeat.'</Q></P>
<P>The authore&s;s of her life has given us a farther account of her affairs with Vander Albert, in which &s;he contrived to pre&s;erve her honour, without injuring her gratitude. There was a woman at Antwerp, who had often given A&s;traea warning of Albert's fickle|ne&s;s and incon&s;tancy, a&s;&s;uring her he never loved after enjoyment, and &s;ometimes changed even before he had that pretence; of which &s;he her&s;elf was an in&s;tance; Albert having married her, and de&s;erted her on the wedding-night. Our poete&s;s took the op|portunity of her acquaintance with this lady to put an hone&s;t trick upon her lover, and at the &s;ame time do ju&s;tice to an injured woman. Accordingly &s;he
<PB N="23" REF="26">
made an appointment with Albert, and contrived that the lady who&s;e name was Catalina, &s;hould meet him in her &s;tead. The plot &s;ucceeded and Catalina infinitely plea&s;ed with the advanture, appointed the next night, and the following, till at la&s;t he di&s;|covered the cheat, and re&s;olved to gratify both his love and re&s;entment, by enjoying A&s;traea even again&s;t her will. To this purpo&s;e he bribed an elderly gentlewoman, whom Mrs. Behn kept out of charity, to put him to bed dre&s;t in her night-cloaths in her place, when A&s;traea was pa&s;&s;ing the evening in a merchant's hou&s;e in the town. The merchant&punc;s &s;on and his two daughters waited on A&s;traea home; and to conclude the evening's mirth with a frolick, the young gentle|man propo&s;ed going to bed to the old woman, and that they &s;hould all come in with candles and &s;urprize them together. As it was agreed &s;o they did, but no &s;ooner was the young &s;park put to bed, but he found him&s;elf acco&s;ted with ardour, and a man's voice, &s;aying, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'have I now caught thee, thou malicious charmer! now I'll not let thee go till thou ha&s;t done me ju&s;tice for all the wrongs thou ha&s;t offered my doating love.'</Q> The re&s;t of the company were extremely &s;urprized to find Albert in A&s;traea's bed in&s;tead of the old woman, and Albert no le&s;s &s;urprized to find the young &s;park in&s;tead of A&s;traea. In the conclu&s;ion, the old woman was di&s;|carded, and Albert's fury at his di&s;appointment ap|pea&s;ed by a promi&s;e from Mrs. Bhen, of marrying him at his arrival in England; but Albert returning to Holland to make preparations for his voyage to England, died of a Fever at Am&s;terdam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>. From this adventure it plainly appears, that the ob&s;erva|tion of a Dutchman's not being capable to love is fal&s;e; for both Albert, and the Ne&s;torian wooer, &s;eem to have been warm enough in their addre&s;&s;es.</P>

After pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome time in this manner at Antwerp, &s;he embarked at Dunkirk for England; and in her pa&s;&s;age, was near being lo&s;t, for the &s;hip being driven on the coa&s;t, foundered within &s;ight of land, but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of boats from the &s;hore, they were all &s;aved; and Mrs. Behn arriving in London, dedicated the re&s;t of her life to plea&s;ure and poetry. Be&s;ides publi&s;hing three volumes of mi&s;cel|lany poems, &s;he wrote &s;eventeen plays, and &s;ome hi&s;tories and novels.

<HEAD>Sir GEORGE ETHEREGF,</HEAD>
<P>A Celebrated wit in the reign of Charles and James II. He is &s;aid to have been de&s;cend|ed of an ancient family of Oxford&s;hire, and born about the year 1636; it is thought he had &s;ome part of his education at the univer&s;ity of Cam|bridge, but in his younger years he travelled into France, and con&s;equently made no long &s;tay at the univer&s;ity. Upon his return, he, for &s;ome time, &s;tudied the Municipal Law at one of the Inns of Court, in which, it &s;eems, he made but little progre&s;s, and like other men of &s;prightly genius, abandoned it for plea&s;ure, and the gayer accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>In the year 1664 the town was obliged with his fir&s;t performance for the &s;tage, entitled the Comi|cal Revenge, or Love in a Tub, the writing where|of brought him acquainted, as he him&s;elf inform|ed us, with the earl of Dor&s;et, to whom it is by the author dedicated. The fame of this play, to|gether with his ea&s;y, unre&s;erved conver&s;ation, and happy addre&s;s, rendered him a favourite with the leading wits, &s;uch as the duke of Buckingham, Sir Charles Sedley, the earl of Roche&s;ter, Sir Car Scroop. Being animated by this encouragement, in 1668, he brought another comedy upon the &s;tage, entitled She Would if She Could; which gained him no le&s;s applau&s;e, and it was expected, that by the continuance of his &s;tudies, he would poli&s;h
<PB N="34" REF="37">
and enliven the theatrical ta&s;te, and be no le&s;s con|&s;tant in &s;uch entertainments, than the mo&s;t a&s;&s;idu|ous of his cotemporaries, but he was too much addicted to plea&s;ure, and being impelled by no nece&s;&s;ity, he neglected the &s;tage, and never writ, 'till he was forced to it, by the importunity of his friends. In 1676, his la&s;t comedy called the Man of Mode, or Sir Fopling Flutter, came on the &s;tage, with the mo&s;t extravagant &s;ucce&s;s; he was then a &s;ervant to the beautiful duche&s;s of York, of whom Dryden has this very &s;ingular-expre&s;&s;ion, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that he does not think, that at the general re|&s;urrection, &s;he can be made to look more charm|ing than now.'</Q> Sir George dedicates this play to his Royal Mi&s;tre&s;s, with the mo&s;t courtly turns of compliment. In this play he is &s;aid to have drawn, or to u&s;e the modern cant, taken off, &s;ome of the contemporary coxcombs; and Mr. Dryden, in an Epilogue to it, has endeavoured to remove the &s;u&s;picion of per&s;onal &s;atire, and &s;ays, that the character of Flutter is meant to ridicule none in particular, but the whole fraternity of fini&s;hed fops, the idolaters of new fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>His words are,<Q><L>True fops help nature's work, and go to &s;chool,</L>
<L>To file and fini&s;h God Almighty's fool:</L>
<L>Yet none Sir Fopling, him, or him, can call,</L>
<L>He's Knight o'th' Shire, and repre&s;ents you all.</L></Q></P>
<P>But this indu&s;try, to avoid the imputation of per|&s;onal &s;atire, but &s;erved to heighten it; and the town &s;oon found out originals to his characters. Sir Fopling was &s;aid to be drawn for one Hewit, a beau of tho&s;e times, who, it &s;eems, was &s;uch a creature as the poet ridiculed, but who, perhaps, like many other coxcombs, would never have been
<PB N="35" REF="38">
remembered, but for this circum&s;tance, which tran&s;|mits his memory to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>The character of Dorimant was &s;uppo&s;ed to repre|&s;ent the earl of Roche&s;ter, who was incon&s;tant, faith|le&s;s, and undetermined in his amours; and it is likewi&s;e &s;aid, in the character of Medley, that the poet has drawn out &s;ome &s;ketch of him&s;elf, and from the authority of Mr. Bowman, who played Sir Fopling, or &s;ome other part in this comedy, it is &s;aid, that the very Shoemaker in Act I. was al&s;o meant for a real per&s;on, who, by his impro|vident cour&s;es before, having been unable to make any profit by his trade, grew afterwards, upon the public exhibition of him, &s;o indu&s;trious and notable, that he drew a crowd of the be&s;t cu&s;tomers to him, and became a very thriving trade&s;man. Whether the poet meant to di&s;play the&s;e characters, we cannot now determine, but it is certain, the town's a&s;cribing them to &s;ome particular per&s;ons, was paying him a very high compliment, and if it proved no more, it at lea&s;t demon&s;trated, a clo&s;e imitation of nature, a beauty which con&s;ti|tutes the greate&s;t perfection of a comic poet.</P>
<P>Our author, it &s;eems, was addicted to &s;ome gay ex|travagances, &s;uch as gaming, and an unlicen&s;ed in|dulgence in women and wine, which brought &s;ome &s;atirical reflexions upon him. Gildon in his Lives of the Dramatic Poets, &s;ays, that upon marrying a fortune, he was knighted; the circum&s;tances of it are the&s;e: He had, by his gaming and extravagance, &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed his affairs, that he courted a rich widow in order to retrieve them; but &s;he being an ambitious woman, would not conde&s;cend to marry him, unle&s;s he could make her a lady, which he was obliged to do by the purcha&s;e of a knight|hood; and this appears in a Con&s;olatary Epi&s;tle to captain Julian, from the duke of Buckingham, in which this match is reflected on. We have no ac|count
<PB N="36" REF="39">
of any i&s;&s;ue he had by this lady, but from the information of Mr. Bowman we can &s;ay, that he cohabited. for &s;ome time, with the celebrated Mrs. Barry the actre&s;s, and had one daughter by her; that he &s;ettled 5 or 6000 l. on her, but that &s;he died young.</P>
<P>From the &s;ame intelligence, it al&s;o appears, that Sir George was, in his per&s;on, a fair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biogr. Brit. p. 1844.</NOTE>, &s;lender, genteel man, but &s;poiled his countenance with d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">inking, and other habits of intemperance. In his deportment he was very affable and courteous, of a generous di&s;po&s;ition, which, with his free, lively, and natural vein of writing, acquired him the ge|neral character of gentle George, and ea&s;y Ethe|rege, in re&s;pect of which qualities, we often find him compared to Sir Charles Sedley. His court|ly and ea&s;y behaviour &s;o recommended him to the Duche&s;s of York, that when on the acce&s;&s;ion of King James II. &s;he became Queen, &s;he &s;ent him amba&s;&s;ador abroad, Gildon &s;ays, to Hamburgh; but it is pretty evident, that he was in that reign a mini&s;ter at Ratisbon, at lea&s;t, from the year 1686, to the time his maje&s;ty left this kingdom, if not later, but it appears that he was there, by his own letters wrote from thence to the earl of Mid|dleton</P>
<P>After this la&s;t comedy, we meet with no more he ever wrote for the &s;tage; however, there are pre&s;erved &s;ome letters of his in pro&s;e, pub|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hed among a collection of Familiar Letters, by John earl of Roche&s;ter; two of which, &s;ent to the duke of Buckingham, have particular merit, both for the archne&s;s of the turns, and the acutene&s;s of the ob&s;ervation. He gives his lord&s;hip a humorous de&s;cription of &s;ome of the Germans, their exce&s;&s;ive drunkenne&s;s; their plodding &s;tupidity and offen&s;ive indelicacy; he complains that he has no compani|on

He men|tions, however, one Mon&s;ieur Hoffman, who mar|ried a French lady, with whom he was very great, and after the calamitous accident of Mr. Hoffman's being drowned, he plea&s;antly de&s;cribes the grief of the widow, and the methods he took of removing her &s;orrow, by an attempt in which he &s;ucceeded.

<HEAD>WILLIAM MOUNTFORD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman, who was very much di&s;tin|gui&s;hed as a player, was born in the year 1659, but of what family we have no account, farther than that they were of Stafford&s;hire; the extraordinary circum&s;tances of Mr. Mountford's death, have drawn more attention upon him, than he might otherwi&s;e have had; and though he was not very con&s;iderable as a poet, yet he was of great eminence as an actor. Mr. Cibber, in his Apology for his own Life, has mentioned him with the greate&s;t re&s;pect, and drawn his character with &s;trong touches of admiration. After having deline|ated the theatrical excellences of Kyna&s;ton, Sand|ford, &amp;c. he thus &s;peaks of Mountford. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Of per|&s;on he was tall, well made, fair, and of an agree|able a&s;pect, his voice clear, full, and melodious; in tragedy he was the mo&s;t affecting lover with|in my memory; his addre&s;&s;es had a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s recommendation from the very tone of his voice, which gave his words &s;uch &s;oftne&s;s, that as Dry|den &s;ays,'<Q><L>&mdash; ' Like flakes of feather'd &s;now,</L>

the de&s;pairing, the tran&s;ported, and the a|miable, in the highe&s;t perfection. In comedy he gave the true&s;t life to what we call the fine gentleman; his &s;pirit &s;hone the brighter for be|ing poli&s;hed by decency. In &s;cenes of gaiety he never broke into the regard that was due to the pre&s;ence of equal, or &s;uperior characters, tho' inferior actors played them; he filled the &s;tage, not by elbowing and cro&s;&s;ing it before others, or di&s;concerting their action, but by &s;urpa&s;&s;ing them in true and ma&s;terly touches of nature; he never laughed at his own je&s;t, unle&s;s the point of his raillery upon another required it; he had a particular talent in giving life to bons mots and repartees; the wit of the poet &s;eemed al|ways to come from him extempore, and &s;harp|ened into more wit from his brilliant manner of delivering it; he had him&s;elf a good &s;hare of it, or what is equal to it, &s;o lively a plea&s;ant|ne&s;s of humour, that when either of the&s;e fell into his hands upon the &s;tage, he wantoned with them to the highe&s;t delight of his auditors. The agreeable was &s;o natural to him, that even in that di&s;&s;olute character of the Rover, he &s;eemed to wa&s;h off the guilt from vice, and gave it charms and merit; for though it may be a re|proach to the poet to draw &s;uch characters, not only unpuni&s;hed, but rewarded, the actor may &s;till be allowed his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e prai&s;e in his excellent per|formance; and this was a di&s;tinction which, when this comedy was acted at Whitehall, King William's Queen Mary was plea&s;ed to make in favour of Mountford, notwith&s;tanding her di&s;ap|probation of the play; which was heightened by the con&s;ideration of its having been written by a lady, viz. Mrs. Behn, from whom more mo|de&s;ty might have been expected.' <P>'He had, be&s;ides all this, a variety in his ge|nius, which few capital actors have &s;hewn, or per|haps have thought it any addition of their me|rit

<P>Mr. Cibber further ob&s;erves, that if, &s;ome years after the death of Mountford, he him&s;elf had any &s;ucce&s;s in tho&s;e parts, he acknowledges the advan|tages he had received from the ju&s;t idea, and &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions from Mountford's acting them. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Had he been remembered (&s;ays he) when I fir&s;t at|tempted them, my defects would have been more ea&s;ily di&s;covered, and con&s;equently my favoura|ble reception in them mu&s;t have been very much, and ju&s;tly abated. If it could be remem|bered, how much he had the advantage of me in voice and per&s;on, I could not here be &s;u&s;pected of an affected mode&s;ty, or overvaluing his ex|cellence: for he &s;ung a clear, counter-tenor, and had a melodious, warbling throat, which could not but &s;et off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t &s;cene of Sir Courtly with uncommon happine&s;s, which I, alas! could only &s;truggle through, with the faint excu&s;es, and real confidence of a fine &s;inger, under the imperfection of a feigned, and &s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eaming treble,

<P>This is the amiable repre&s;entation which Mr. Cibber makes of his old favourite, and who&s;e judgment in theatrical excellences has been ever indi&s;puted. But this fini&s;hed performer did not live to reap the advantages which would have ari&s;en from the great figure he made upon the &s;tage.</P>
<P>He fell in the 33d year of his age, by the hand of an a&s;ia&s;&s;in, who cowardly murdered him, and fled from ju&s;tice. As we imagine it will not be unplea&s;ing to the reader to be made acquaint|ed with the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances relating to that affair, we &s;hall here in&s;ert them, as they appear on the trial of lord Mohun, who was ar|raigned for that murder, and acquitted by his peers. Lord Mohun, it is well known, was a man of loo&s;e morals, a rancorous &s;pirit, and, in &s;hort, reflected no honour on his titles. It is a true ob&s;ervation, that the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of a man may be more accurately known by the com|pany he keeps, than by any other means of read|ing the human heart: Lord Mohun had con|tracted a great intimacy with one captain Hill, a man of &s;candalous morals, and de&s;picable life; and was &s;o fond of this fellow, whom, it &s;eems, nature had wonderfully formed to be a cut-throat, that he entered into his &s;chemes, and became a par|ty in promoting his mo&s;t criminal plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>This murderer had long entertained a pa&s;&s;ion &s;or Mrs. Bracegirdle, &s;o well known, as an ex|cellent actre&s;s, and who died not many years ago, that it would be &s;uperfluous to give a particular account of her; his pa&s;&s;ion was re|jected with di&s;dain by Mrs. Bracegirdle, who did not think &s;uch a heart as his worth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. The contempt with which &s;he u&s;ed captain
<PB N="44" REF="47">
Hill fired his re&s;entment; he valued him&s;elf for being a gentleman, and an officer in the army, and thought he had a right, at the fir&s;t on&s;et, to triumph over the heart of an actre&s;s; but in this he found him&s;elf mi&s;erably mi&s;taken: Hill, who could not bear the contempt &s;hewn him by Mrs. Bracegirdle, conceived that her aver&s;ion mu&s;t proceed from having previou&s;ly engaged her heart to &s;ome more favoured lover; and though Mr. Mountford was a married man, he became j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">a+lous of him, probably, from no other rea&s;on, than the re&s;pect with which he ob&s;erved Mr. Mountford treat her, and their frequently playing together in the &s;ame &s;cene. Confirmed in this &s;u&s;picion, he re&s;olved to be revenged on Mount|ford, and as he could not po&s;&s;e&s;s Mrs. Bracegir|dle by gentle means, he determined to have re|cour&s;e to violence, and hired &s;ome ruffians to a&s;|&s;i&s;t him in carrying her off. His chief accomplice in this &s;cheme was lord Mohun, to whom he communicated his intention, and who concurred with him in it. They appointed an evening for that purpo&s;e, hired a number of &s;oldiers, and a coach, and went to the playhou&s;e in order to find Mrs. Bracegirdle, but &s;he having no part in the play of that night, did not come to the hou&s;e. They then got intelligence that &s;he was gone with her mother to &s;up at one Mrs. Page's in Drury-Lane; thither they went, and fixed their po&s;t, in expecta|tion of Mrs. Bracegirdle's coming out, when they intended to have executed their &s;cheme again&s;t her. She at la&s;t came out, accompanied with her mother and Mr. Page: the two adventurers made a &s;ign to their hired bravo's, who laid their hands on Mrs. Bracegirdle: but her mother, who threw her arms round her wai&s;t, preventing them from thru&s;ting her immediately into the coach, and Mr. Page gaining time to call a&s;&s;i&s;tance, their attempt was
<PB N="45" REF="48">
fru&s;trated, and Mrs. Bracegirdle, her mother, and Mr. Page, were &s;afely conveyed to her own hou&s;e in Howard-&s;treet in the Strand. Lord Mohun and Hill, enraged at this di&s;appointment, re&s;olved, &s;ince they were un&s;ucce&s;sful in one part of their de|&s;ign, they would yet attempt another; and that night vowed revenge again&s;t Mr. Mountford.</P>
<P>They went to the &s;treet where Mr. Mountford lived, and there lay in wait for him: Old Mrs. Bracegirdle and another gentlewoman who had heard them vow revenge again&s;t Mr. Mountford, &s;ent to his hou&s;e, to de&s;ire his wife to let him know his danger, and to warn him not to come home that night, but unluckily no me&s;&s;enger Mrs. Mountford &s;ent was able to find him: Captain Hill and lord Mohun paraded in the &s;treets with their &s;words drawn; and when the watch made enquiry into the cau&s;e of this, lord Mohun an&s;wered, that he was a peer of the realm, and dared them to touch him at their peril; the night-officers being in|timidated at this threat, left them unmole&s;ted, and went their rounds. Towards midnight Mr. Mountford going home to his own hou&s;e was &s;aluted in a very friendly manner, by lord Mohun; and as his lord&s;hip &s;eemed to cary no marks of re&s;entment in his behaviour, he u&s;ed the freedom to a&s;k him, how he came there at that time of night? to which his lord&s;hip replied, by a&s;king if he had not heard the affair of the woman? Mountford a&s;ked what woman? to which he an&s;wered Mrs. Bracegirdle; I hope, &s;ays he, my lord, you do not encourage Mr. Hill in his attempt upon Mrs. Bracegirdle; which however is no concern of mine; when he uttered the&s;e words, Hill, behind his back, gave him &s;ome de&s;pe|rate blows on his head, and before Mr. Mountford had time to draw, and &s;tand on his defence, he ba&s;e|ly run him thro' the body, and made his e&s;cape; the alarm of murder being given, the con&s;table &s;eized lord Mohun, who upon hearing that Hill had e&s;|caped
<PB N="46" REF="49">
expre&s;&s;ed great &s;atisfaction, and &s;aid he did not care if he were hanged for him: When the evi|dences were examined at Hick's-Hall, one Mr. Ben|croft, who attended Mr. Mountford, &s;wore that Mr. Mountford declared to him as a dying man, that while he was talking to lord Mohun, Hill &s;truck him, with his left hand, and with his right hand run him thro' the body, before he had time to draw his &s;word.</P>
<P>Thus fell the unfortunate Mountford by the hand of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, without having given him any provocation; &s;ave that which his own jealou&s;y had rai&s;ed, and which could not rea&s;onably be imputed to Mountford as a crime.</P>
<P>Lord Mohun, as we have already ob&s;erved, was tried, and acquitted by his peers; as it did not ap|pear, that he immediately a&s;&s;i&s;ted Hill, in perpetra|ting the murder, or that they had concerted it be|fore; for tho' they were heard to vow revenge again&s;t Mountford, the word murther was never mentioned. It &s;eems abundantly clear, that lord Mohun, however, if not active, was yet acce&s;&s;ary to the murther; and had his crime been high trea|&s;on, half the evidence which appeared again&s;t him, might have been &s;ufficient to co&s;t him his head. This nobleman him&s;elf was killed at la&s;t in a duel with the duke of Hamilton<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The foundation of the quarrel between lord Mohun and the duke (however it might be improved by party &s;ugge&s;tions) was a law &s;uit between the&s;e noblemen, on account of part of the earl of Macclesfield's e&s;tate, which Mr. Savage would have been heir to, had not his mother, to facilitate her de|&s;igned divorce from that earl (with the plea&s;ing view of having her large fortune re&s;tored to her, and the no le&s;s plea&s;ing pro|&s;pect of being freed from an uncomfortable hu&s;band) declared unhappy Savage to be illegitimate, and natural &s;on of the then earl Rivers.

<P>THIS celebrated poet-laureat was de&s;cended of a very antient family in Stafford&s;hire; the elde&s;t branch of which has enjoyed an e&s;tate there of five-hundred pounds per ann. He was born about the year 1640, at Stanton-Hall in Norfolk, a &s;eat of his father's, and educated at Caius College in Cambridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Dictionary. See the article Shadwell.</NOTE>, where his father had been likewi&s;e bred; and then placed in the middle Temple, to &s;tudy the law; where having &s;pent &s;ome time, he travelled abroad. Upon his return home he became acquainted with the mo&s;t celebrat|ed per&s;ons of wit, and di&s;tingui&s;hed quality, in that age; which was &s;o much addicted to poetry and polite literature, that it was not ea&s;y for him, who had no doubt a native reli&s;h for the &s;ame ac|compli&s;hments, to ab&s;tain from the&s;e the fa&s;hionable &s;tudies and amu&s;ements of tho&s;e times. He applied him&s;elf chiefly to the dramatic kind of writing, in which he had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s. At the revolution, Mr. Dryden, who had &s;o warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the oppo&s;ite intere&s;t, was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his place of Poet Laureat, and Mr. Shadwell &s;ucceeded him in it, which em|ployment he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed till his death. Mr. Shadwell has been illu&s;trious, for nothing &s;o much as the quarrel which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and Dryden, who held him in the greate&s;t contempt. We cannot di&s;cover what was the cau&s;e of Mr. Dryden's aver&s;ion to Shadwell, or how this quarrel began, unle&s;s it was
<PB N="49" REF="52">
occa&s;ioned by the vacant Laurel being be&s;towed on Mr. Shadwell: But it is certain, the former pro&s;e|cuted his re&s;entment &s;everely, and, in his Mac Fleck|noe, has tran&s;mitted his antagoni&s;t to po&s;terity in no advantageous light. It is the nature of &s;atire to be biting, but it is not always its nature to be true: We cannot help thinking that Mr. Dryden has treated Shadwell a little too unmercifully; and has violated truth to make the &s;atire more pungent. He &s;ays, in the piece abovementioned,<Q><L>Others to &s;ome faint meaning make pretence,</L>
<L>But Shadwell never deviates into &s;en&s;e.</L></Q></P>
<P>Which is not &s;trictly true. There are high authorities in favour of many of his Comedies, and the be&s;t wits of the age gave their te&s;timony for them: They have in them fine &s;trokes of humour, the characters are often original, &s;trongly mark'd, and well &s;u&s;tained; add to this, that he had the greate&s;t expedition in writing imaginable, and &s;ometimes produced a play in le&s;s than a month. Shadwell, as it appears from Roche&s;ter's Se&s;&s;ion of the Poets, was a great favourite with Otway, and as they lived in intimacy together, it might perhaps be the occa&s;ion of Dryden's expre&s;&s;ing &s;o much contempt for Otway; which his cooler judgment could never have directed him to do.</P>
<P>Mr. Shadwell died the 19th of December 1692, in the fifty-&s;econd year of his age, as we are informed by the in&s;cription upon his monument in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey; tho' there may be &s;ome mi&s;take in that date; for it is &s;aid in the title page of his funeral &s;ermon preached by Dr. Nicholas Brady, that he was in|terred at Chel&s;ea, on the 24th of November, that year. This &s;ermon was publi&s;hed 1693, in quarto, and in it Dr. Brady tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That our author was a man of great hone&s;ty and integrity, an inviolable

<HEAD>Sir WILLIAM KILLEGREW.</HEAD>
<P>THE elde&s;t &s;on of Sir Robert Killegrew, Knt chamberlain to the Queen, was born at the Manor of Hanworth, near Hampton-Court, in the month of May, 1605. He became a gentleman commoner in St. John's College in Mid&s;ummer term 1622; where continuing about three years he tra|velled beyond &s;eas, and after his return, was made governor of Pendennis ca&s;tle, and of Falmouth ha|ven in Cornwall, with command of the militia in the we&s;t part of that county. After this he was cal|led to attend King Charles I. as one of the gentle|men u&s;hers of his privy chamber; in which employ|ment he continued till the breaking out of the great rebellion; and had the command given him of one of the two great troops of hor&s;e that guarded the King's per&s;on, during the whole cour&s;e of the was between his Maje&s;ty and his Parliament. Our author was in attendance upon the King when the court re&s;ided at Oxford, and was created doctor of the civil laws 1642; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood, Athen.

<P>Upon the re&s;toration of King Charles II. he was the fir&s;t of his father's &s;ervants that he took any notice of, and made him gentleman-u&s;her of his privy chamber: the &s;ame place he enjoyed under the decea&s;ed King.

<P>All the&s;e plays were printed together in folio, Oxon 1666. There is another play a&s;cribed to our author, called the Imperial Tragedy, printed in 1699; the chief part was taken out of a Latin play, and much altered by him for his own diver&s;ion; tho' upon the importunity of his friends, he was prevailed upon to publi&s;h it, but without his name. The plot is founded upon the hi&s;tory of Zeno, the 12th emperor of Con&s;tantinople after Con|&s;tantine.

<HEAD>Sir ROBERT HOWARD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was a younger &s;on of Tho|mas earl of Berk&s;hire, by Elizabeth his wife, one of the daughters and coheirs of William lord Burghley, and received his education at Magdalen|college, Oxford, under the tuition of Dr. E. Drope. During the civil wars, he &s;uffered with the re&s;t of his family, who maintained their loyalty to the unfortunate King Charles I. Upon the re&s;to|ration, our author was made a knight, and was cho&s;en one of the burge&s;&s;es for Stockbridge in Hamp&s;hire, to &s;erve in the Parliament which be|gan at We&s;tmin&s;ter 8th of May 1661; he was quickly preferred to the place of auditor of the Exchequer, then worth &s;ome thou&s;and pounds per annum, and was reckoned one of King Charles's creatures, whom he advanced, on account of his faithful &s;ervices in cajoling the Parliament for Mo|ney.</P>
<P>In the year 1679 he was cho&s;en burge&s;s for Ca&s;tle-ri&s;ing in Norfolk, to &s;erve in that Parliament which began at We&s;tmin&s;ter on the 17th of Octo|ber 1680.

and di&s;claimed all manner of conver&s;ation and inter cour&s;e with any of that character. He is &s;aid to have been a man extremely po&s;itive, and a pretender to a more general under&s;tanding than he really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. His ob&s;tinacy and pride procured him many enemies, among&s;t whom the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ke of Buckingham was the fir&s;t; who intended to have expo&s;ed Sir Robert under the name of Bil|boa in the Rehear&s;al; but the plague which then prevailed occa&s;ioned the theatres to be &s;hut up, and the people of fa&s;hion to quit the town.

<P>Thomas Shadwell the poet, tho' a man of the &s;ame principles with Sir Robert, concerning the revolution and &s;tate matters, was yet &s;o angry with the knight for his &s;upercilious domineering manner of behaving, that he points him out under the name of Sir Po&s;itive At All, one of his cha|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">cters in the comedy called the Sullen Lovers, or the Impertinents; and among&s;t the &s;ame per|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ons is the lady Vain, a Courtezan, which the wits then under&s;tood to be the mi&s;tre&s;s of Sir Ro|bert Howard, whom he afterwards thought pro|per to marry.</P>
<P>In February 1692, being then in the decline of life, he married one Mrs Dives, maid of ho|nour to the Queen.

<P>Had Sir Robert been a man of any parts, he had &s;ufficient advantages from his birth and for|tune to have made a figure, but the highe&s;t notice which he can claim in the republic of letters, is, that he was brother in law to Dryden.</P>

<P>We have no account of any extraordinary indi|cations of genius given by this great poet, while in his earlier days; and he is one in&s;tance how little regard is to be paid to the figure a boy makes at &s;chool: Mr. Dryden was turned of thirty before he introduced any play upon the &s;tage, and his fir&s;t, called the Wild Gallants, met with a very indifferent reception; &s;o that if he had not been im|pelled by the force of genius and propen&s;ion, he had never again attempted the &s;tage: a circum&s;tance which the lovers of dramatic poetry mu&s;t ever have regretted, as they would in this ca&s;e have been de|prived of one of the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t ornaments that ever adorned the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rofe&s;&s;ion.</P>

That Mr. Dryden had at this time no fixed prin|ciples, either in religion or politics, is abundantly evident, from his heroic &s;tanza's on Oliver Cromwel, written after his funeral 1658; and immediately upon the re&s;toration he publi&s;hed A&s;traea Redux, a poem, on the happy re&s;toration of Charles the IId; and the &s;ame year, his Panegyric to the king on his coronation: In the former of the&s;e pieces, a re|markable di&s;tich has expos'd our poet to the ridicule of the wits.<Q><L>An horrid &s;tillne&s;s fir&s;t invades the ear,</L>

<P>The critics have remarked, that as to tragedy, he &s;eldom touches the pa&s;&s;ions, but deals rather in pompous language, poetical flights, and de&s;crip|tions; and too frequently makes his characters &s;peak better than they have occa&s;ion, or ought to do, when their &s;phere in the drama is con&s;idered: And it is peculiar to Dryden (&s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on) to make his per&s;onages, as wi&s;e, witty, elegant and polite as him&s;elf. That he could not &s;o intimately affect the tender pa&s;&s;ions, is certain, for we find no play of his, in which we are much di&s;po&s;ed to weep; and we are &s;o often inchanted with beautiful de&s;crip|tions, and noble flights of fancy, that we forget the bu&s;ine&s;s of the play, and are only attentive to the poet, while the characters &s;leep. Mr. Gildon ob|&s;erves in his laws of poetry, that when it was re|commended to Mr. Dryden to turn his thoughts to
<PB N="67" REF="70">
a tran&s;lation of Euripides, rather than of Homer, he confe&s;&s;ed that he had no reli&s;h for that poet, who was a great ma&s;ter of tragic &s;implicity. Mr. Gildon, further ob&s;erves, as a confirmation that Dryden's ta&s;te for tragedy was not of the genuine &s;ort, that he con&s;tantly expre&s;&s;ed great contempt for Otway, who is univer&s;ally allowed to have &s;ucceeded very hap|pily in affecting the tender pa&s;&s;ions: Yet Mr. Dryden, in his preface to the tran&s;lation of M. Du Fre&s;noy, &s;peaks more favourably of Otway; and after men|tioning the&s;e in&s;tances, Gildon a&s;cribes this ta&s;te in Dryden, to his having read many French Romances.&mdash;The truth is, if a poet would affect the heart, he mu&s;t not exceed nature too much, nor colour too high; di&s;tre&s;sful circum&s;tances, &s;hort &s;peeches, and pathetic ob&s;ervations never fail to move in|finitely beyond the highe&s;t rant, or long declamations in tragedy: The &s;implicity of the drama was Otway's peculiar excellence; a living poet ob&s;erves, that from Otway to our own times,<Q><L>From bard to bard, the frigid caution crept,</L>
<L>And declamation roar'd while pa&s;&s;ion &s;lept.</L></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Dryden &s;eems to be &s;en&s;ible, that he was not born to write comedy; for, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I want that gaiety of humour which is required in it; my con|ver&s;ation is &s;low and dull, my humour &s;aturnine and re&s;erved.

The tragedies of Otway, Lee and Southern, are irre&s;i&s;tibly moving, but they convey not &s;uch grand &s;entiments, and their lan|guage is far from being &s;o poetical as Dryden's; now, if one dramatic poet writes to move, and an|other to enchant and in&s;truct, as in&s;truction is of greater con&s;equence than being agitated, it follows naturally, that the latter is the mo&s;t excellent writer, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the greate&s;t genius.</P>
<P>But perhaps our poet would have wrote better in both kinds of the drama, had not the nece&s;&s;ity of his circum&s;tances obliged him to comply with the po|pular ta&s;te. He him&s;elf, in his dedication to the Spani&s;h Fryar, in&s;inuates as much. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I remember, &s;ays he, &s;ome ver&s;es of my own Maximin and Almanzor, which cry vengeance upon me for their extravagance.

<P>In 1671 Mr. Dryden was publicly ridiculed on the &s;tage, in the duke of Buckingham's comedy, called the Rehear&s;al, under the character of Bays: This character, we are informed, in the Key to the Rehear&s;al, was originally intended for Sir Robert Howard, under the name of Bilboa; but the repre|&s;entation being put a &s;top to, by the breaking out of the plague, in 1665, it was laid by for &s;everal years, and not exhibited on the &s;tage till 1671, in which interval, Mr. Dryden being advanced to the Laurel, the noble author changed the name of his poet, from Bilboa to Bays, and made great altera|tions in his play, in order to ridicule &s;everal dramatic performances, that appeared &s;ince the fir&s;t writing it. Tho&s;e of Mr. Dryden, which fell under his grace's la&s;h, were the Wild Gallant, Tyrannic Love, the Conque&s;t of Granada, Marriage A-la-Mode, and Love in a Nunnery: Whatever was extravagant, or too warmly expre&s;&s;ed, or any way unnatural, the author has ridiculed by parody.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden affected to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;atire levelled at him in the Rehear&s;al, as appears from his dedica|tion of the tran&s;lation of Juvenal and Per&s;ius, where &s;peaking of the many lampoons, and libels that had been written again&s;t him, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I an&s;wered not to the Rehear&s;al, becau&s;e I knew the author &s;at to him&s;elf when he drew the pic|ture, and was the very Bays of his own farce; becau&s;e al&s;o I knew my betters were more con|cerned than I was in that &s;atire; and la&s;tly, be|cau&s;e

<P>In 1679 came out an E&s;&s;ay on Satire, &s;aid to be written jointly by Mr. Dryden and the earl of Mul|grave; this piece, which was handed about in ma|nu&s;cript, containing Reflexions on the Duche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, and the Earl of Roche&s;ter; who &s;u&s;|pecting, as Wood &s;ays, Mr. Dryden to be the au|thor, hired three ruffians to cudgel him in Wills's coffee-hou&s;e at eight o'clock at night. This &s;hort anecdote, I think, cannot be told without indigna|tion. It proved Roche&s;ter was a malicious coward, and, like other cowards, cruel and in&s;olent; his &s;oul was incapable of any thing that approached towards genero&s;ity, and when his re&s;entment was heated, he pur&s;ued revenge, and retained the mo&s;t la&s;ting hatred; he had always entertained a prejudice again&s;t Dryden, from no other motive than envy: Dryden's plays met with &s;ucce&s;s, and this was enough to fire the re&s;entment of Roche&s;ter, who was naturally envious. In order to hurt the cha|racter, and &s;hake the intere&s;t of this noble poet, he recommended Crown, an ob&s;cure man, to write a Ma&s;que for the court, which was Dryden's pro|vince, as poet-laureat, to perform. Crown in this &s;ucceeded, but &s;oon after, when his play called the Conque&s;t of Jeru&s;alem met with &s;uch extra|vagant applau&s;e, Roche&s;ter, jealous of his new favourite, not only abandoned him, but com|menced from that moment his enemy.</P>
<P>The other per&s;on again&s;t whom this &s;atire was le|velled, was not &s;uperior in virtue to the former, and all the nation over, two better &s;ubjects for &s;atire

<P>In 1680 came out a tran&s;lation of Ovid's Epi|&s;tles in Engli&s;h ver&s;e, by &s;everal hands, two of which were tran&s;lated by Mr. Dryden, who al&s;o wrote the preface. In the year following our au|thor publi&s;hed Ab&s;alom and Achitophel. It was fir&s;t printed without his name, and is a &s;evere &s;atire again&s;t the contrivers and abettors of the oppo&s;i|tion again&s;t King Charles II. In the &s;ame year that Ab&s;alom and Achitophel was publi&s;hed, the Medal, a Satire, was likewi&s;e given to the public. This piece is aimed again&s;t &s;edition, and was occa&s;ioned by the &s;triking of a medal, on account of the indictment again&s;t the earl of Shaft&s;bury for high trea&s;on being found ignoramus by the grand jury, at the Old Bailey, November 1681: For which the Whig party made great rejoicings by ringing of bells, bonfires, &amp;c. in all parts of Lon|don. The poem is introduced with a very &s;ati|rical epi&s;tle to the Whigs, in which the author &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have one favour to de&s;ire you at parting, that when you think of an&s;wering this poem, you would employ the &s;ame pens again&s;t it, who have combated with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t Ab&s;alom and Achitophel, for then you may a&s;|&s;ure your&s;elves of a clear victory without the lea&s;t reply.

Mr. Elkanah Settle wrote an an&s;wer to this poem, entitled the Medal Re|ver&s;ed. However contemptible Settle was as a poet, yet &s;uch was the prevalence of parties at that time, that, for &s;ome years, he was Dryden's rival on the &s;tage. In 1682 came out his Religio Laici, or a Layman's Faith; this piece is intended as a defence of revealed religion, and the excellency and authority of the &s;criptures, as the only rule of faith and manners, again&s;t Dei&s;ts, Papi&s;ts, and Pre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">yterians. He acquaints us in the preface, that it was written for an ingenious young gen|tleman, his friend; upon his tran&s;lation of Father Simons's Critical Hi&s;tory of the Old Te&s;tament, and that the &s;tile of it was epi&s;tolary.</P>
<P>In 1684 he publi&s;hed a tran&s;lation of M. Maim|bourg's Hi&s;tory of the League, in which he was employed by the command of King Charles II. on account of the pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n parallel between the trou|bles of France, and tho&s;e of Great Britain. Upon the death of Charles II. he wrote his Threnodia Augu&s;talis, a Poem, &s;acred to the happy memory of that Prince. Soon after the acce&s;&s;ion of James II. our author turned Roman Catholic, and by this extraordinary &s;tep drew upon him&s;elf abun|dance of ridicule from wits of the oppo&s;ite faction; and in 1689 he wrote a Defence of the Papers, written by the late King of ble&s;&s;ed memory, found in his &s;trong box.

the reformation in England, which he affirms was erected on the foundation of lu&s;t, &s;acrilege, and u&s;urpation. Dr. Stillingfleet hereupon an|&s;wered Mr. Dryden, and treated him with &s;ome &s;everity. Another author affirms, that Mr. Dry|den's tract is very light, in &s;ome places ridi|culous; and ob&s;erves, that his talent lay towards controver&s;y no more in pro&s;e, than, by the Hind and Panther, it appeared to do in ver&s;e. This poem of the Hind and Panther is a direct defence of the Romi&s;h Church, in a dialogue between a Hind, which repre&s;ents the Church of Rome, and a Panther, which &s;upports the character of the Church of England. The fir&s;t part of this poem con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t in general characters and narration, which, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have endeavoured to rai&s;e, and give it the maje&s;tic turn of heroic poetry.

<P>This poem was attacked by Mr. Charles Monta|gue, afterwards Earl of Hallifax, and Mr. Matthew Prior, who joined in writing the Hind and Panther, tran&s;ver&s;ed to the Country Mou&s;e, and City Mou&s;e, Lond. 1678, 4to. In the preface to which, the author ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that Mr. Dryden's poem natural|ly falls into ridicule, and that in this burle&s;que, nothing is repre&s;ented mon&s;trous and unnatural, that is not equally &s;o in the original.'</Q> They af|terwards remark, that they have this comfort under the &s;everity of Mr. Dryden's &s;atire, to &s;ee his abili|ties equally le&s;&s;ened with his opinion of them, and that he could not be a fit champion again&s;t the Pan|ther till he had laid a&s;ide his judgment.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been engaged in tran&s;lating M. Varillas's Hi&s;tory of Here&s;ies, but to have dropped that de&s;ign. This we learn from a pa&s;&s;age in Burnet's reflexions on the ninth book of the fir&s;t volume of M. Varillas's Hi&s;tory, being a reply to his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here give the picture the Dr. has drawn of this noble poet, which is, like a great many of the doctor's other characters, rather exhibited to
<PB N="75" REF="78">
plea&s;e him&s;elf than according to the true re&s;em|blance.</P>
<P>The doctor &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I have been informed from England, that a gentleman who is famous both for poetry, and &s;everal other things, has &s;pent three months in tran&s;lating Mr. Varillas's hi&s;tory; but as &s;oon as my reflexions appeared, he di&s;|continued his labours, finding the credit of his author being gone. Now if he thinks it is re|covered by his an&s;wer, he will, perhaps, go on with his tran&s;lation; but this may be, for ought I know, as good an entertainment for him, as the conver&s;ation he has &s;et on foot between the Hinds and Panthers, and all the re&s;t of the animals; for whom M. Varillas may &s;erve well enough as an author; and this hi&s;tory and that poem are &s;uch extraordinary things of their kind, that it will be but &s;uitable to &s;ee the author of the wor&s;t poem become the tran&s;lator of the wor&s;t hi&s;tory, that the age has produced. If his grace and his wit improve &s;o proportionably, we &s;hall hardly find, that he has gained much by the change he has made, from having no religion, to chu&s;e one of the wor&s;t. It is true he had &s;ome|what to &s;ink from in matter of wit, but as for his morals, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for him to grow a wor&s;e man than he was. He has lately wreaked his malice on me for &s;poiling his three months la|bour; but in it he has done me all the honour a man can receive from him, which is to be railed at by him. If I had ill-nature enough to prompt me to wi&s;h a very bad wi&s;h for him, it &s;hould be that he would go and fini&s;h his tran&s;lation. By that it will appear whether the Engli&s;h nation, which is the mo&s;t compe|tent judge of this matter, has upon &s;eeing this debate, pronounced in M. Varillas's favour or me. It is true, Mr. Dryden will &s;uffer a little by it; but at lea&s;t it will &s;erve to keep him in from
<PB N="76" REF="79">
other extravagancies; and if he gains little ho|nour by this work, yet he cannot lo&s;e &s;o much by it, as he has done by his la&s;t em|ployment.'</Q></P>
<P>When the revolution was compleated, Mr. Dry|den having turned Papi&s;t, became di&s;qualified for holding his place, and was accordingly di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; and it was conferred on a man to whom he had a confirmed aver&s;ion; in con|&s;equence whereof he wrote a &s;atire again&s;t him, called Mac Flecknoe, which is one of the &s;e|vere&s;t and be&s;t written &s;atires in our language.</P>
<P>Mr. Richard Flecknoe, the new laureat, with who&s;e name it is in&s;cribed, was a very indifferent poet of tho&s;e times; or rather as Mr. Dryden ex|pre&s;&s;es it, and as we have already quoted in Fleck|noe's life.<Q><L>In pro&s;e and ver&s;e was own'd without di&s;pute,</L>

<P>This poem furni&s;hed the hint to Mr. Pope to write his Dunciad; and it mu&s;t be owned the latter has been more happy in the execution of his de&s;ign, as having more lei&s;ure for the per|formance; but in Dryden's Mac Flecknoe there are &s;ome lines &s;o extremely pungent, that I am not quite certain if Pope has any where exceeded them.</P>
<P>In the year wherein he was deprived of the laurel, he publi&s;hed the life of St. Francis Xavier, tran&s;lated from the French of father Dominic Bouchours. In 1693 came out a tran&s;lation of Juvenal and Per&s;ius; in which the fir&s;t, third, &s;ixth, tenth, and &s;ixteenth &s;atires of Juvenal, and Per&s;ius entire, were done by Mr. Dryden, who prefixed a long and ingenious di&s;cour&s;e, by way of dedication, to the earl of Dor&s;et. In this addre&s;s our author takes occa&s;ion a while to drop his reflexions on
<PB N="77" REF="80">
Juvenal; and to lay before his lord&s;hip a plan for an epic poem: he ob&s;erves, that his genius never much inclined him to the &s;tage; and that he wrote for it rather from nece&s;&s;ity than inclina|tion. He complains, that his circum&s;tances are &s;uch as not to &s;uffer him to pur&s;ue the bent of his own genius, and then lays down a plan up|on which an epic poem might be written: to which, &s;ays he, I am more inclined. Whether the plan propo&s;ed is faulty or no, we are not at pre|&s;ent to con&s;ider; one thing is certain, a man of Mr. Dryden's genius would have covered by the rapidity of the action, the art of the de&s;ign, and the beauty of the poetry, whatever might have been defective in the plan, and produced a work which have been the boa&s;t of the nation.</P>
<P>We cannot help regretting on this occa&s;ion, that Dryden's fortune was not ea&s;y enough to enable him, with convenience and lei&s;ure, to pur&s;ue a work that might have proved an honour to him|&s;elf, and reflected a portion thereof on all who &s;hould have appeared his encouragers on this occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>In 1695 Mr. Dryden publi&s;hed a tran&s;lation in pro&s;e of Du Fre&s;noy's Art of Painting, with a pre|face containing a parallel between painting and poetry. Mr. Pope has addre&s;&s;ed a copy of ver&s;es to Mr. Jervas in prai&s;e of Dryden's tran&s;lation. In 1697 his tran&s;lation of Virgil's works came out.

<P>Dr. Trap charges Mr. Dryden with gro&s;sly mi&s;|taking his author's &s;en&s;e in many places; with ad|ding or retrenching as his turn is be&s;t &s;erved with either; and with being lea&s;t a tran&s;lator where he &s;hines mo&s;t as a poet; whereas it is a ju&s;t rule laid down by lord Ro&s;common, that a tran&s;|lator in regard to his author &s;hould

Mr. Dryden, he tells us, frequently acts the ve|ry rever&s;e of this precept, of which he produces &s;ome in&s;tances; and remarks in general, that the fir&s;t &s;ix books of the Aeneis, which are the be&s;t and mo&s;t perfect in the original, are the lea&s;t &s;o in the tran&s;lation. Dr. Trap's remarks may po&s;|&s;ibly be true; but in this he is an in&s;tance how ea&s;y it is to di&s;cover faults in other men's works, and how difficult to avoid them in our own.</P>
<P>Dr. Trap's tran&s;lation is clo&s;e, and conveys the author's meaning literally, &s;o con&s;equently may be fitter for a &s;chool-boy, but men of riper judgment, and &s;uperior ta&s;te, will hardly approve it; if Dry|den's is the mo&s;t &s;pirited of any tran&s;lation, Trap's is the dulle&s;t that ever was written; which proves that none but a good poet is fit to tran&s;late the works of a good poet.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the original pieces and tran&s;lations hitherto mentioned, Mr. Dryden wrote many others, publi&s;h|ed in &s;ix volumes of Mi&s;cellanies, and in other col|lections. They con&s;i&s;t of tran&s;lations from the Greek
<PB N="79" REF="82">
and Latin poets, Epi&s;tles to &s;everal per&s;ons, pro|logues, and epilogues to &s;everal plays, elegies, epi|taphs, and &s;ongs. His la&s;t work was his Fables, an|cient and modern, tran&s;lated into ver&s;e from Homer, Ovid, Boccace, and Chaucer. To this work, which is perhaps, one of his mo&s;t imperfect, is prefixed by way of preface, a critical account of the authors, from whom the fables are tran&s;lated. Among the original pieces, the Ode to St. Cecilia's day is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t elevated in any language. It is impo&s;&s;ible for a poet to read this without be|ing filled with that &s;ort of enthu&s;ia&s;m which is pe|culiar to the in&s;pired tribe, and which Dryden largely felt when he compo&s;ed it. The turn of the ver&s;e is noble, the tran&s;itions &s;urprizing, the lan|guage and &s;entiments ju&s;t, natural, and heighten|ed. We cannot be too lavi&s;h in prai&s;e of this Ode: had Dryden never wrote any thing be&s;ides, his name had been immortal. Mr. Pope has the following beautiful lines in its prai&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on Critici&s;m.</NOTE>.<Q><L>Hear how Timotheus varied lays &s;urprize,</L>

Henry Sheers, and the Preface to the Dialogue concerning Women, by William Wal&s;h, E&s;quire.</P>
<P>Before we give an account of the dramatic works of Dryden, it will be proper here to in&s;ert a &s;tory concerning him, from the life of Con|greve by Charles Wil&s;on e&s;quire, which that gen|tleman received from the lady whom Mr. Dryden celebrates by the name of Corinna, of whom it appears he was very fond; and who had the rela|tion from lady Chudleigh. Dryden with all his under&s;tanding was weak enough to be fond of Judicial A&s;trology, and u&s;ed to calculate the nativity of his children. When his lady was in labour with his &s;on Charles, he being told it was decent to withdraw, laid his watch on the table, begging one of the ladies then pre&s;ent, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, to take exact notice of the very minute the child was born, which &s;he did, and acquainted him with it. About a week after, when his lady was pretty well recovered, Mr. Dryden took occa&s;ion to tell her that he had been calcu|lating the child's nativity, and ob&s;erved, with grief, that he was born in an evil hour, for Jupiter, Venus, and the &s;un, were all under the earth, and the lord of his a&s;cendant afflicted with a hateful &s;quare of Mars and Saturn. If he lives to arrive at his 8th year (&s;ays he) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he will go near to die a violent death on his very birth-day, but if he &s;hould e&s;cape, as I &s;ee but &s;mall hopes, he will in the 23d year be under the very &s;ame evil di|rection, and if he &s;hould e&s;cape that al&s;o, the 33d or 34th year is, I fear'</Q>&mdash;here he was in|terrupted by the immoderate grief of his lady, who could no longer hear calamity prophecy'd to befall her &s;on. The time at la&s;t came, and Augu&s;t was the inau&s;picious month in which young Dryden was to enter into the eighth year of his age. The court being in progre&s;s, and Mr. Dryden at lei&s;ure, he was invited to the country &s;eat of the earl of Berk|&s;hire,
<PB N="81" REF="84">
his brother-in-law, to keep the long vacation with him in Charlton in Wilts; his lady was invited to her uncle Mordaunt's, to pa&s;s the remainder of the &s;ummer. When they came to divide the chil|dren, lady Elizabeth would have him take John, and &s;uffer her to take Charles; but Mr. Dryden was too ab&s;olute, and they parted in anger; he took Charles with him, and &s;he was obliged to be con|tent with John. When the fatal day came, the an|xiety of the lady's &s;pirits occa&s;ioned &s;uch an effer|ve&s;cence of blood, as threw her into &s;o violent a fever, that her life was de&s;paired of, till a letter came from Mr. Dryden, reproving her for her womani&s;h credulity, and a&s;&s;uring her, that her child was well, which recovered he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;pirits, and in &s;ix weeks after &s;he received an ecclairci&s;&s;ement of the whole affair. Mr. Dryden, either thro' fear of being reckoned &s;u|per&s;titious, or thinking it a &s;cience beneath his &s;tudy, was extremely cautious of letting any one know that he was a dealer in A&s;trology; therefore could not excu&s;e his ab&s;ence, on his &s;on's anniver&s;ary, from a general hunting match lord Berk&s;hire had made, to which all the adjacent gentlemen were invited. When he went out, he took care to &s;et the boy a double exerci&s;e in the Latin tongue, which he taught his children him&s;elf, with a &s;trict charge not to &s;tir out of the room till his return; well knowing the ta&s;k he had &s;et him would take up longer time. Charles was performing his duty, in obedience to his father, but as ill fate would have it, the &s;tag made to|wards the hou&s;e; and the noi&s;e alarming the &s;ervants, they ha&s;ted out to &s;ee the &s;port. One of them took young Dryden by the hand, and led him out to &s;ee it al&s;o, when ju&s;t as they came to the gate, the &s;tag be|ing at bay with the dogs, made a bold pu&s;h and leaped over the court wall, which was very low, and very old; and the dogs following, threw down a part of the wall ten yards in length, under which Charles
<PB N="82" REF="85">
Dryden lay buried. He was immediately dug out, and after &s;ix weeks langui&s;hing in a dangerous way he recovered; &s;o far Dryden's prediction was fulfill|ed: In the twenty-third year of his age, Charles fell from the top of an old tower belonging to the Vati|can at Rome, occa&s;ioned by a &s;wimming in his head, with which he was &s;eized, the heat of the day being exce&s;&s;ive. He again recovered, but was ever after in a langui&s;hing &s;ickly &s;tate. In the thirty-third year of his age, being returned to England, he was un|happily drowned at Wind&s;or. He had with another gentleman &s;wam twice over the Thames; but re|turning a third time, it was &s;uppo&s;ed he was taken with the cramp, becau&s;e he called out for help, tho' too late. Thus the father's calculation proved but too prophetical.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden died the fir&s;t of May 1701, and was interred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abby. On the 19th of April he had been very bad with the gout, and eri&s;ipelas in one leg; but he was then &s;omewhat recovered, and de&s;igned to go abroad; on the Friday following he eat a partridge for his &s;upper, and going to take a turn in the little garden behind his hou&s;e in Gerard-&s;treet, he was &s;eized with a violent pain under the ball of the great toe of his right foot; that, unable to &s;tand, he cried out for help, and was carried in by his &s;ervants, when upon &s;ending for &s;urgeons, they found a &s;mall black &s;pot in the place affected; he &s;ubmitted to their pre&s;ent applications, and when gone called his &s;on Charles to him, u&s;ing the&s;e words. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I know this black &s;pot is a mortification: I know al&s;o, that it will &s;eize my head, and that they will at|tempt to cut off my leg; but I command you my &s;on. by your filial duty, that you do not &s;uffer me to be di&s;membered:'</Q> As he foretold, the event proved, and his &s;on was too dutiful to di&s;obey his father's commands.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">
On the Wedne&s;day morning following, he breath|ed his la&s;t, under the mo&s;t excruciating pains, in the 69th year of his age; and left behind him the lady Elizabeth, his wife, and three &s;ons.

<P>John, another of his &s;ons, died of a fever at Rome; and Charles as has been ob&s;erved, was drowned in the Thames; there is no account when, or at what place Harry his third &s;on died.</P>
<P>Charles Dryden, who was &s;ome time u&s;her to pope Clement II. was a young gentleman of a ve|ry promi&s;ing genius; and in the affair of his father's funeral, which I am about to relate, &s;hewed him|&s;elf a man of &s;pirit and re&s;olution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Congreve.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The day after Mr. Dryden's death, the dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;ent word to Mr. Dryden's widow, that he would make a pre&s;ent of the ground, and all other Abbey-fees for the funeral: The lord Halifax likewi&s;e &s;ent to the lady Elizabeth, and to Mr. Charles Dryden, offering to defray the ex|pences of our poet's funeral, and afterwards to be|&s;tow 500 l. on a monument in the Abbey: which generous offer was accepted. Accordingly, on &s;un|day following, the company being a&s;&s;embled, the corp&s;e was put into a velvet hear&s;e, attended by eighteen mourning coaches. When they were ju&s;t ready to move, lord Jefferys, &s;on of lord chancellor Jeffreys, a name dedicated to infamy, with &s;ome of his raki&s;h companions riding by, a&s;ked who&s;e funeral it was; and being told it was Mr. Dryden's, he prote&s;ted he &s;hould not be buried in that private manner, that he would him&s;elf, with the lady Eliza|beth's leave, have the honour of the interment, and would be&s;tow a thou&s;and pounds on a monument in
<PB N="84" REF="87">
the Abbey for him. This put a &s;top to their pro|ce&s;&s;ion; and the lord Jefferys, with &s;everal of the gentlemen, who had alighted from their coaches, went up &s;tairs to the lady, who was &s;ick in bed. His lord&s;hip repeated the purport of what he had &s;aid below; but the lady Elizabeth refu&s;ing her con&s;ent, he fell on his knees, vowing never to ri&s;e till his reque&s;t was granted. The lady under a &s;ud|den &s;urpri&s;e fainted away, and lord Jeffery's pre|tending to have obtained her con&s;ent, ordered the body to be carried to Mr. Ru&s;&s;el's an undertaker in Cheap&s;ide, and to be left there till further orders. In the mean time the Abbey was lighted up, the ground opened, the choir attending, and the bi&s;hop waiting &s;ome hours to no purpo&s;e for the corp&s;e. The next day Mr. Charles Dryden waited on my lord Halifax, and the bi&s;hop; and endeavoured to excu&s;e his mother, by relating the truth. Three days after the undertaker having received no orders, waited on the lord Jefferys; who pretended it was a drunken frolic, that he remembered nothing of the matter, and he might do what he plea&s;ed with the body. Upon this, the undertaker waited on the lady Elizabeth, who de&s;ired a day's re&s;pite, which was granted. Mr. Charles Dryden imme|diately wrote to the lord Jefferys, who returned for an&s;wer, that he knew nothing of the matter, and would be troubled no more about it. Mr. Dryden hereupon applied again to the lord Halifax, and the bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter, who ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to do any thing in the affair.</P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s, Dr. Garth, who had been Mr. Dryden's intimate friend, &s;ent for the corp&s;e to the college of phy&s;icians, and propo&s;ed a &s;ub&s;cription; which &s;ucceeding, about three weeks after Mr. Dryden's decea&s;e, Dr. Garth pronounced a fine l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tin oration over the body, which was conveyed from the college, attended by a numerous train of
<PB N="85" REF="88">
coaches to We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, but in very great di&s;order. At la&s;t the corp&s;e arrived at the Abbey, which was all unlighted. No organ played, no anthem &s;ung; only two of the &s;inging boys preced|ed the corp&s;e, who &s;ung an ode of Horace, with each a &s;mall candle in their hand. When the fune|ral was over, Mr. Charles Dryden &s;ent a challenge to lord Jefferys, who refu&s;ing to an&s;wer it, he &s;ent &s;everal others, and went often him&s;elf; but could neither get a letter delivered, nor admittance to &s;peak to him; which &s;o incen&s;ed him, that finding his lord&s;hip refu&s;ed to an&s;wer him like a gentleman, he re&s;olved to watch an opportunity, and brave him to fight, though with all the rules of honour; which his lord&s;hip hearing, quitted the town, and Mr. Charles never had an opportunity to meet him, though he &s;ought it to his death, with the utmo&s;t application.</P>

But not to dwell on the&s;e contro|ver&s;ies about his character, let us hear what Mr. Congreve &s;ays in the dedication of Dryden's works to the duke of Newca&s;tle: Congreve knew him in|timately, and as he could have no motive to de|ceive the world in that particular; and being a man of untainted morals, none can &s;u&s;pect his authority; and by his account we &s;hall &s;ee, that Dryden was indeed as amiable in private life, as a Man, as he was illu&s;trious in the eye of the public, as a Poet.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden (&s;ays Congreve) <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'had per&s;onal qualities, to challenge love and e&s;teem from all who were truly acquainted with him.

had read. He was not more po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of know|ledge, than he was communicative of it; but then, his communication of it was by no means pedan|tic, or impo&s;ed upon the conver&s;ation, but ju&s;t &s;uch, and went &s;o far, as by the natural turns of the di&s;cour&s;e in which he was engaged, it was nece&s;&s;arily prompted, or required. He was ex|tremely ready and gentle in the correction of the errors of any writer, who thought fit to con&s;ult him, and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehen&s;ion of others in re&s;pect of his own over|&s;ight or mi&s;takes. He was of a very ea&s;y, I may &s;ay, of very plea&s;ing acce&s;s; but &s;omething &s;low, and as it were diffident in his advances to others. He had &s;omething in his nature that abhorred intru&s;ion in any &s;ociety what&s;oever; and indeed, it is to be regretted. that he was rather blameable on the other extreme. He was of all men I ever knew, the mo&s;t mode&s;t, and the mo&s;t ea&s;y to be di&s;countenanced in his approaches, either to his &s;uperiors or his equals.&mdash;As to his writings&mdash;I may venture to &s;ay in general terms, that no man hath written in our language &s;o much, and &s;o various matter; and in &s;o various manners &s;o well. Another thing I may &s;ay, was very pecu|liar to him, which is, that his parts did not de|cline with his years, but that he was an improv|ing writer to the la&s;t, even to near 70 years of age, improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment, witne&s;s his Ode on St. Cecilia's Day, and his fables, his late&s;t perform|ances. He was equally excellent in ver&s;e and pro&s;e: His pro&s;e had all the clearne&s;s imaginable, without deviating to the language or diction of poetry, and I have heard him frequently own with plea&s;ure, that if he had any talent for writing pro&s;e; it was owing to his frequentl hav|ing read the writings of the great archbi&s;hop Til|lot&s;on. In his poems, his diction is, wherever his

<ITEM>15. Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida; or Truth found too late; a Tragedy, acted at the duke's theatre, and printed in 4to. 1679.

This play was originally Shake&s;pear's, and revi&s;ed, and altered by Mr. Dryden, who added &s;everal new &s;cenes.&mdash;The plot taken from Chaucer's Troilus and Cre&s;|&s;ida, which that poet tran&s;lated from the original &s;tory written in Latin ver&s;e, by Lollius, a Lom|bard.</ITEM>

There is pre|fixed to it the Life of Cleomenes, tran&s;lated from Plu|tarch by Mr. Creech. This play was fir&s;t prohibited by the lord Chamberlain, but upon examination being found innocent of any de&s;ign to &s;atirize the government, it was &s;uffered to be repre&s;ented, and had great &s;ucce&s;s. In the preface, the author tells us, that a fooli&s;h objection had been rai&s;ed again&s;t him by the &s;parks, for Cleomenes not accepting the favours of Ca&s;&s;andra. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'They (&s;ays he) would not have refu&s;ed a fair lady; I grant they would not, but let them grant me, that they are no he|roes.'</Q></ITEM>

<HEAD>Sir CHARLES SEDLEY, Bart.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman, who obtained a great name in the world of gallantry, was &s;on of Sir John Sedley, of Aylesford in Kent. When our author was about the age of 17, he became a fellow of Wadham college 1656, but he took no degree. When he quitted the univer&s;ity, he retired into his own country, and neither went to travel nor to the inns of cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t. As &s;oon as the re|&s;toration was effected, Sir Charles came to London,
<PB N="95" REF="98">
in order to join in the general jubilee, and then commenced wit, courtier, poet, and gallant.</P>
<P>He was &s;o much applauded in all conver&s;ations that he began to be the oracle of the poets; and it was by his judgment every performance was ap|proved or condemned; which made the King je&s;t with him, and tell him, that nature had given him a patent to be Apollo's viceroy. Lord Ro|che&s;ter bears te&s;timony to this, when he puts him &s;oremo&s;t among the judges of poetry.<Q><L>I loath the rabble, tis enough for me,</L>
<L>If Sedley, Shadwell, Shepherd, Wycherly,</L>
<L>Godolphin, Butler, Buckhur&s;t, Buckingham,</L>
<L>And &s;ome few more, whom I omit to name,</L>
<L>Approve my &s;en&s;e, I count their cen&s;ure fame.</L></Q></P>
<P>It happened by Sir Charles, in re&s;pect of the king, as is &s;aid of the famous cardinal Richlieu, viz. That they who recommended him to the Royal fa|vour, thereby &s;upplanted them&s;elves, and afterwards envied him; but with this difference between the Cardinal and Sir Charles, that the latter was never ungrateful. When he had a ta&s;te of the court, as the King never would part with him, &s;o he never would part from the King; and yet two things proved particularly detrimental to him in it, fir&s;t his e&s;tate, &s;o far from being improved was dimini&s;h|ed; and &s;econdly his morals were debauched. The King delighted in his conver&s;ation, and he was the dearer to his Maje&s;ty on this account, that he never a&s;ked a favour; whereas &s;ome other courtiers by their bold importunity exhau&s;ted that prince's trea|&s;ures, who could not deny a man who craved, tho' he hated his forwardne&s;s; nor could remember the &s;ilent indigence of his friend, tho' he applauded the mode&s;ty of it. He was deeply immer&s;ed in the public di&s;tractions of the times, and is &s;aid to have
<PB N="96" REF="99">
committed many debaucheries, of which the fol|lowing in&s;tance has been recorded.</P>
<P>In the month of June 1663 our author, Charles lord Buckhur&s;t, and Sir Thomas Ogle, were con|vened at a public hou&s;e in Bow-&s;treet, Covent-Garden, and being enflamed with &s;trong liquors, they went up to the balcony belonging to that hou&s;e, and there &s;hewed very indecent po&s;tures, and gave great offence to the pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;treet by very unmannerly di&s;charges upon them; which done, Sedley &s;tripped him&s;elf naked, and preached to the people in a gro&s;s and &s;candalous manner; whereupon a riot being rai&s;ed, the mob became very clamorous, and would have forced the door next to the &s;treet; but being oppo&s;ed, the preacher and his company were driven off the balcony, and the windows of a room into which they retired were broken by the mob. The frolic being &s;oon &s;pread abroad, and as per&s;ons of fa&s;hion were concerned in it, it was &s;o much the more ag|gravated. The company were &s;ummoned to appear before a court of ju&s;tice in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, where being indicted for a riot before Sir Robert Hyde, lord chief ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, they were all fined, and Sir Charles being &s;entenced to pay 500 l. he u&s;ed &s;ome very impertinent expre&s;&s;ions to the judge; who thereupon a&s;ked him if he had ever read a book called the Compleat Gentleman; to which Sir Charles made an&s;wer, that he had read more books than his lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The day for payment being appointed, Sir Charles de&s;ired Mr. Henry Killegrew, and another gentle|man to apply to his Maje&s;ty to have the fine remit|ted, which they undertook to do; but in place of &s;upplicating for it, they repre&s;ented Sir Charles's
<PB N="97" REF="100">
frolic rather in an aggravating light, and not a farthing was abated.</P>
<P>After this affair, Sir Charles's mind took a more &s;erious turn, and he began to apply him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of politics, by which he might be of &s;ome &s;ervice to his country. He was cho&s;en, &s;ays Wood, a recruiter of that long parliament, which began at We&s;tmin&s;ter the 8th of May 1661, to &s;erve for New Romney in Kent, and &s;at in three &s;ucceeding Parli|ments &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of that.</P>
<P>Sir Charles, con&s;idered as an author, has great delicacy in his turns, and Eachard ob&s;erves in his dedication of Plautus's three come|dies to Sir Charles, that the ea&s;ine&s;s of his &s;tile, the politene&s;s of his expre&s;&s;ions in his Bellamira, and even tho&s;e parts of it which are purely tran|&s;lation, are very delightful, and engaging to the reader.</P>
<P>Lord Roche&s;ter, in his imitation of the 10th &s;atire of the fir&s;t book of Horace, has the following ver|&s;es in his commendation.<Q><L>Sedley has that prevailing gentle art,</L>
<L>That can with a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s charm impart</L>
<L>The loo&s;e&s;t wi&s;hes to the cha&s;te&s;t heart:</L>
<L>Rai&s;e &s;uch a conflict, kindle &s;uch a fire,</L>
<L>Betwixt declining virtue and de&s;ire;</L>
<L>That the poor vanqui&s;h'd maid di&s;&s;olves away</L>
<L>In dreams all night, in &s;ighs and tears all day.</L></Q></P>
<P>Before we give an account of our author's works, it will not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that he was ex|tremely active in effecting the revolution, which was thought the more extraordinary, as he had received favours from King James II. That Prince, it &s;eems, had fallen in love with a daughter of Sir Charles's, who was not very hand&s;ome; for James was remarkable for dedicating his affections
<PB N="98" REF="101">
to women who were not great beauties; in con|&s;equence of his intrigue with her, and in order to give her greater lu&s;tre in life, he created Mi&s;s Sedley counte&s;s of Dorche&s;ter. This honour, &s;o far from plea&s;ing, greatly &s;hocked Sir Charles. How|ever libertine him&s;elf had been, yet he could not bear the thoughts of his daughter's di&s;honour; and with regard to this her exaltation, he only con&s;ider|ed it as rendering her more con&s;picuou&s;ly infamous. He therefore conceived a hatred to James, and rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ily joined to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him of his throne and do|minions.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked one day, why he appeared &s;o warm again&s;t the King, who had created his daughter a Counte&s;s? It is from a principle of gra|titude I am &s;o warm, returns Sir Charles; for &s;ince his Maje&s;ty has made my daughter a Counte&s;s, it is fit I &s;hould do all I can to make his daughter a Queen.</P>
<P>Our author's works are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Mulberry Garden, a Comedy, acted by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants at the theatre-royal 1668, dedi|cated to the duche&s;s of Richmond and Lennox.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Anthony and Cleopatra, a Tragedy, acted at the Duke of York's theatre 1667. This play was acted with great applau&s;e. The Story from Plu|tarch's Life of Anthony.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Bellamira; or the Mi&s;tre&s;s, a Comedy, acted by his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervants, 1687. It is taken from Terence's Eunuch. While this play was acting, the roof of the play-hou&s;e fell down, but very few were hurt, except the author: who&s;e merry friend Sir Fleetwood Shepherd told him, that there was &s;o much fire in the play, that it blew up the poet, hou&s;e and all: Sir Charles an&s;wered, No, the play was &s;o
<PB N="99" REF="102">
heavy it brought down the hou&s;e, and buried the poet in his own rubbi&s;h.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Beauty the Conqueror; or the Death of Mark Anthony, a Tragedy.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e plays, Mr. Coxeter &s;ays, he is au|thor of the two following, which were never printed till with his works in 2 vols. 8vo. 1719. dedicated by Bri&s;coe the book&s;eller to the duke of Chandois.<LIST>
<ITEM>The Grumbler, a Comedy of three acts, &s;cene Paris.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Tyrant King of Crete, a Tragedy.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Sedley's poems, however amorou&s;ly tender and delicate, yet have not much &s;trength; nor do they afford great marks of genius. The &s;oftne&s;s of his ver&s;es is denominated by the Duke of Bucking|ham, Sedley's Witchcraft. It was an art too &s;ucce&s;sful in tho&s;e days to propagate the immo|ralities of the times, but it mu&s;t be owned that in point of cha&s;tity he excels Dor&s;et, and Ro|che&s;ter; who as they conceived lewdly, wrote in plain Engli&s;h, and did not give them&s;elves any trouble to wrap up their ribbaldry in a dre&s;s tol|lerably decent. But if Sedley was the more cha&s;te, I know not if he was the le&s;s pernicious writer: for that pill which is gilded will be &s;wallowed more readily, and with le&s;s reluctance, than if ten|dered in its own di&s;gu&s;tful colours. Sedley in&s;inu|ates gently into the heart, without giving any alarm, but is no le&s;s fraught with poi&s;on, than are tho&s;e who&s;e deformity be&s;peaks their mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>It would be tedious to enumerate here all the poems of Sir Charles Sedley; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that they are printed in two &s;mall volumes along with his plays, and con&s;i&s;t of tran&s;|lations of Virgil's Pa&s;torals, original Pa&s;torals, Pro|logues,
<PB N="100" REF="103">
Songs, Epilogues, and little occa&s;ional pieces.</P>
<P>We &s;hall pre&s;ent the reader with an original pa&s;toral of Sir Charles's, as a &s;pecimen of his works.</P>
<P>He lived to the beginning of Queen Anne&punc;s reign, and died at an age near 90; his wit and humour continuing to the la&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN CROWNE</HEAD>
<P>WAS the &s;on of an independent mini&s;ter, in that part of North America, which is called Nova Scotia. The vivacity of his genius made him &s;oon grow impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country; which he therefore quitted in order to &s;eek his fortune in England; but it was his fate, upon his fir&s;t arrival here, to engage in an employment more formal, if po&s;&s;ible, than his American education. Mr. Dennis, in his Letters, vol. i. p. 48, has given us the be&s;t ac|count of this poet, and upon his authority the a|bove, and the &s;ucceeding circum&s;tances are related. His nece&s;&s;ity, when he fir&s;t arrived in England, was extremely urgent, and he was obliged to be|come a gentleman u&s;her to an old independent la|dy; but he &s;oon grew as weary of that preci&s;e of|fice, as he had done before of the di&s;cipline of Nova Scotia. One would imagine that an educa|tion, &s;uch as this, would be but an indifferent pre|parative for a man to become a polite author, but &s;uch is the irre&s;i&s;table force of genius, that neither this, nor his poverty, which was very de|plorable, could &s;uppre&s;s his ambition: a&s;piring to reputation, and di&s;tinction, rather than to fortune and power. His writings &s;oon made him known to the court and town, yet it was neither to the favour of the court, nor to that of the earl of Roche&s;ter,
<PB N="105" REF="108">
that he was indebted to the nomination the king made of him, for the writing the Ma&s;que of Ca|lyp&s;o, but to the malice of that noble lord, who de&s;igned by that preference to mortify Mr. Dry|den.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking out of the two parties, af|ter the pretended di&s;covery of the Popi&s;h plot, the favour he was in at court, and the gaiety of his temper, which inclined him to join with the fa|&s;hion, engaged him to embrace the Tory party. About that time he wrote the City Politicks, in or|der to &s;atirize and expo&s;e the Whigs: a comedy not without wit and &s;pirit, and which has obtained the approbation of tho&s;e of contrary principles, which is the highe&s;t evidence of merit; but after it was ready for the &s;tage, he met with great embarra&s;&s;|ments in getting it acted. Bennet lord Arlington (who was then lord chamberlain, was &s;ecretly in the cau&s;e of the Whigs, who were at that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="3 letters">e potent in Parliament, in order to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t the power of lord trea&s;urer Danby, who was his declared enemy) u&s;ed all his authority to &s;uppre&s;s it. One while it was prohibited on account of its be|ing dangerous; another while it was laid a&s;ide up|on pretence of its being flat and in&s;ipid; till Mr. Crowne, at la&s;t, was forced to have recour&s;e to the King him&s;elf, and engage him to lay his ab&s;o|lute commands on the lord chamberlain to have it no longer delayed. This command he was plea&s;ed to give in his own per&s;on, for Charles II. loved comedy above all other amu&s;ements, except one which was both more expen&s;ive, and le&s;s innocent, and be&s;ides, had a very high opinion of Mr. Crowne's abilities. While he was thus in favour with the King and court, Mr. Dennis declares, he has more than once heard him &s;ay, that though he had a &s;incere affection for the King, he had yet a mortal hatred to the court. The promi&s;e of a
<PB N="106" REF="109">
&s;um of money made him &s;ometimes appear there, to &s;ollicit the payment of it, but as &s;oon as he received the &s;um, he vani&s;hed, and for a long time never approached it.</P>
<P>It was at the latter end of King Charles's reign, that Mr. Crowne, tired wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">h the fatigue of writing, &s;hocked with the uncertainty of theatrical &s;ucce&s;s, and de&s;irous to &s;helter him|&s;elf from the re&s;entment of tho&s;e numerous ene|mies he had made by his City Politics, im|mediately addre&s;&s;ed the King him&s;elf, and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty to e&s;tabli&s;h him in &s;ome of|fice, that might be a &s;ecurity to him for life: the King an&s;wered, he &s;hould be provided for; but added, that he would fir&s;t &s;ee another comedy. Mr. Crowne endeavouring to excu&s;e him&s;elf, by telling the King he plotted &s;lowly and awkwardly, his Maje&s;ty replied, that he would help him to a plot, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o put in his hand the Spani&s;h Comedy called Non Poder E&s;&s;er. Mr. Crowne was obliged immediately to go to work upon it, but after he had written three acts of it, found, to his &s;ur|prize, that the Spani&s;h play had &s;ome time before been tran&s;lated, and acted and damned, under the title of Tarugo's Wiles, or the Coffee-Hou&s;e: yet, &s;upported by the King's command, he went bri&s;kly on, and fini&s;hed it.</P>
<P>Mr. Crowne, who had once before obliged the commonwealth of ta&s;te, with a very agreeable comedy in his City Politics, yet, in Sir Courtly Nice went far beyond it, and very much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; for though there is &s;omething in the part of Crack, which borders upon farce, the Spani&s;h author alone mu&s;t an&s;wer for that: for Mr. Crowne could not omit the part of Crack, that is, of Ta|rugo, and the Spani&s;h farce depending upon it, without a downright affront to the King, who had given him the play for his ground-work. All
<PB N="107" REF="110">
that is of Engli&s;h growth in Sir Courtly Nice is admirable; for though it has neither the fine de|&s;igning of Ben John&s;on, nor the ma&s;culine &s;atire of Wycherley, nor the grace, delicacy, and courtly air of Etherege, yet is the dialogue lively and &s;pi|rited, attractively diver&s;ified, and adapted to the &s;everal characters. Four of the&s;e characters are entirely new, yet general and important, drawn truly, and graphically and artfully oppo&s;ed to each other, Surly to Sir Courtly, and Hot-head to Te&s;timony: tho&s;e extremes of behaviour, the one of which is the grievance, and the other the plague of &s;ociety and conver&s;ation; exce&s;&s;ive ceremony on the one &s;ide, and on the other rudene&s;s, and bru|tality are finely expo&s;ed in Surly and Sir Courtly: tho&s;e divi&s;ions and animo&s;ities in the two great par|ties of England, which have &s;o long di&s;turbed the public quiet, and undermined the general intere&s;t, are happily repre&s;ented and ridiculed in Te&s;timony and Hot-head. Mr. Dennis, &s;peaking of this co|medy, &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that though he has more than twenty times read it, yet it &s;till grows upon him, and he delivers it as his opinion, that the greate&s;t co|mic poet, who ever lived in any age, might have been proud to have been the author of it.'</Q></P>
<P>The play was now ju&s;t ready to appear to the world. Every one that had &s;een it rehear&s;ed, was highly plea&s;ed with it. All who had heard of it conceived great expectations, and Mr. Crowne was delighted with the flattering hope of being made happy for the remaining part of his life, by the performance of the King's promi&s;e: But upon the very la&s;t day of the rehear&s;al, he met Underhill coming from the playhou&s;e, as he him&s;elf was going towards it, upon which the poet reprimanding the player for neglecting &s;o con|&s;iderable a part as he had in the comedy, and on a day of &s;o much con&s;equence, as the very
<PB N="108" REF="111">
la&s;t of the rehear&s;al. Oh Lord, &s;ays Underhill, we are all undone! how! &s;ays Crowne, is the Play|hou&s;e on fire? the whole nation, replies the player, will quickly be &s;o, for the King is dead; at the hearing of which di&s;mal words, the au|thor was thrown almo&s;t into di&s;traction; for he who the moment before was ravi&s;hed with the thought of the plea&s;ure he was about to give the King, and the favours which he was afterwards to receive from him, this moment found, to his un&s;peakable &s;orrow, that his Royal patron was gone for ever, and with him all his hopes. The King indeed re|vived from this apoplectic fit, but three days af|ter died, and Mr. Crowne by his death was re|plunged into the deepe&s;t melancholly.</P>
<P>Thus far Mr. Dennis has traced the life of Crowne; in the &s;ame letter he promi&s;es a further account of him upon another occa&s;ion, which, it &s;eems, never occurred, for we have not been able to find that he has any where el&s;e mentioned our author.</P>
<P>The King's death having put a period to Mr. Crowne's expectations of court-favour (for the reign of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or was too much hurried with party de&s;igns, to admit of any lei&s;ure to reward poeti|cal merit, though the Prince him&s;elf, with all his er|rors about him, was a man of ta&s;te, and had a ve|ry quick di&s;cernment of the power of genius) he, no doubt, had recour&s;e to writing plays again for bread, and &s;upporting him&s;elf the be&s;t way he could by his wits, the mo&s;t unplea&s;ing, and precarious manner of life, to which any man can be expo&s;ed. We cannot be ab&s;olutely certain when Mr. Crowne died; Mr. Coxeter in his notes &s;ays, he was alive in the year 1703, and as he mu&s;t then have been much advanced in years, in all probability he did not long &s;urvive it.</P>

He had only to &s;hew his intrepidity and diligence, in exe|cuting the orders of his commander, when called on; as he had no plans of operation to take up his thoughts why not write a &s;ong? there was neither indecency, nor immorality in it: I doubt not, but with that chearfulne&s;s of mind he com|po&s;ed him&s;elf to re&s;t, with as right feelings, and as proper an addre&s;s to his maker, as any one of a more melancholly di&s;po&s;ition, or gloomy a&s;pect.</P>

<P>After his fatigues at &s;ea, during the remainder of the reign of Charles the IId, he continued to live in honourable lei&s;ure. He was of the bed-chamber to the king, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only his ma&s;ter's favour, but in a great degree his familiarity, never leaving the court but when he was &s;ent to that of France, upon &s;ome &s;hort commi&s;&s;ion, and emba&s;&s;ies of com|pliment; as if the king de&s;igned to rival the French in the article of politene&s;s, who had long claimed a &s;uperiority in that accompli&s;hment, by &s;hewing them that one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed gen|tlemen in Europe was his &s;ubject; and that he un|der&s;tood his worth &s;o well, as not to &s;uffer him to be long out of his pre&s;ence.

<P>Having buried his fir&s;t lady, Elizabeth, daughter of Harvey Bagot, of Whitehall in the county of Warwick, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> widow of Charles Berkley, earl of Falmouth, without any i&s;&s;ue by her, he married, in the year 1684, the lady Mary, daughter of James Compton, earl of Northampton, famed for her beauty, and admirable endowments of mind, who was one of the ladies of the bed-chamber to Queen Mary, and left his lord&s;hip again a widower, Augu&s;t 6, 1691, leaving i&s;&s;ue by him one &s;on, his grace Lionel now duke of Dor&s;et, and a daughter, the lady Mary, married in the year 1702 to Henry Somer&s;et duke of Beaufort, and dying in child-bed, left no i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The earl of Dor&s;et appeared in court at the trail of the &s;even bi&s;hops, accompanied with other noblemen, which had a good effect on the jury, and brought the judges to a better temper than they had u&s;ually &s;hewn.

When prince George of Denmark de&s;erted King James, and joined the prince of Orange, the prin|ce&s;s Anne was in violent apprehen&s;ions of the King's di&s;plea&s;ure, and being de&s;irous of with|drawing her&s;elf, lord Dor&s;et was thought the pro|pere&s;t guide for her nece&s;&s;ary flight<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Hi&s;t. of his own times.</NOTE>.

<P>After the mi&s;guided monarch had withdrawn him&s;elf, lord Dor&s;et continued at London, and was one of tho&s;e peers who &s;at every day in the Council-chamber, and took upon them the go|vernment of the realm, in this extremity, till &s;ome other power &s;hould be introduced. In the de|bates in Parliament immediately after this confu&s;i|on, his lord&s;hip voted for the vacancy of the throne, and that the prince and prince&s;s of Orange &s;hould be declared King and Queen of England, &amp;c. When their Maje&s;ties had accepted the crown of the&s;e realms, his lord&s;hip was the next day &s;worn of the privy-council, and declared lord chamberlain of the hou&s;hold, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'A place, &s;ays Prior, which he eminently adorned by the grace of his per&s;on, the finene&s;s of his breeding, and the knowledge and practice of what was decent and magnificent.'</Q> It appears by the hi&s;tory of Eng|land, that he had the honour to &s;tand godfather, with King William to a &s;on of the prince and prin|ce&s;s of Denmark, born at Hampton-court, the 24th of July 1689, and chri&s;tened the 27th by the name of William, whom his Maje&s;ty declared duke of Glouce&s;ter. When the King had been earne&s;tly entreated by the States of Holland, and the con|federate princes in Germany, to meet at a gene|ral congre&s;s to be held at the Hague, in order to concert matters for the better &s;upport of the confederacy, and thereupon took &s;hipping the 16th of January 1692, his lord&s;hip was among the peers, who to honour their King and Country, waited on their &s;overeign in that cold &s;ea&s;on.

When they were two or three leagues off Goree, his Maje&s;ty having by bad weather been four days at &s;ea, was &s;o impatient to go on &s;hore, that taking boat, and a thick fog ri&s;ing &s;oon after, they were &s;urrounded &s;o clo&s;ely with ice, as not to be able either to make the &s;hore, or get back to the &s;hip; &s;o that lying twenty-two hours, enduring the mo&s;t bitter cold, and almo&s;t de&s;pairing of life, they could hardly &s;tand or &s;peak at their landing; and his lord&s;hip was &s;o lame, that for &s;ome time he did not recover; yet on his return to England, he neither complained of the accident nor the expence.</P>
<P>On the 2d of February 1691, at a chapter of the mo&s;t noble order of the garter, held at Ken|&s;ington, his lord&s;hip was elected one of the knights companions of this order, with his highne&s;s John-George, the fourth elector of Saxony, and was in|&s;talled at Wind&s;or on the February following. He was con&s;tituted four times one of the regents of the kingdom in his Maje&s;ty's ab&s;ence. About the year 1698, his health &s;en&s;ibly declining, he left pub|lic bu&s;ine&s;s to tho&s;e who more delighted in it, and appeared only &s;ometimes at council, to &s;hew his re&s;pect to the commi&s;&s;ion which he bore, for he had already ta&s;ted all the comfort which court favour could be&s;tow; he had been high in office, re&s;pected by his &s;overeign and the idol of the peo|ple; but now when the evening of life approach|ed, he began to look upon &s;uch enjoyments with le&s;s veneration, and thought proper to dedicate &s;ome of his la&s;t hours to quiet and meditation. Being advi&s;ed to go to Bath for the recovery of his health, he there ended his life on the 29th of January 1705-6, and was buried at Wi|tham on the 17th of February following.</P>

<P>WAS de&s;cended of a family of no mean rank in the North of Ireland; we have been in|formed that his father was dean of Armagh, but we have not met with a proper confirmation of this circum&s;tance; but it is on all hands agreed, that he was the &s;on of a clergyman; and born at London Derry in that kingdom, in the year 1678, as appears from Sir James Ware's account of him. There he received the rudiments of education, and di&s;covered a genius early devoted to the Mu&s;es: Before he was ten years of age he gave &s;pecimens of his poetry, in which, force of thinking, and elegance of turn and expre&s;&s;ion are manife&s;t; and if the auther who has wrote Memoirs of his life, may be credited, the following &s;tanza's were written by him at that age,<Q><LG>

<P>His parents, it is &s;aid, had a numerous family, &s;o could be&s;tow no fortune upon him, further than

a genteel education. When he was qualified for the univer&s;ity, he was, in 1694, &s;ent to Trinity College in Dublin: here, by the progre&s;s he made in his &s;tudies, he acquired a con&s;iderable reputa|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Wilks by Obrian, Svo. 1732.</NOTE>, but it does not appear, that he there took his degree of bachelor of arts; for his di&s;po&s;ition being volatile and giddy, he &s;oon grew weary of a dull collegiate life; and his own opinion of it, in that &s;en&s;e, he afterwards freely enough di&s;played in &s;everal parts of his comedies, and other writings: Be&s;ides, the expence of it, without any immediate pro&s;pect of returns, might be incon&s;i&s;tent with his circum&s;tances. The polite entertainments of the town more forcibly attracted his attention, e&s;pe|cially the diver&s;ions of the Theatre, for which he di&s;covered a violent propen&s;ion. When Mr. A&s;hbury, who then was manager of Dublin Theatre, had recruited his company with the ce|lebrated Mr. Wilks (who had for &s;ome fea&s;ons en|gaged with Mr. Chri&s;topher Rich at Drury-Lane, from whom his encouragement was not equal to his merit) Farquhar having acquaintance with him, Mr. Wilks, was &s;oon introduced upon the &s;tage by his means, where he did not long continue, nor make any con&s;iderable figure. His per&s;on was &s;uf|ficiently advantageous, he had a ready memory, proper ge&s;ture, and ju&s;t elocution, but then he was unhappy in his voice, which had not power enough to rou&s;e the galleries, or to rant with any &s;ucce&s;s; be&s;ides, he was defective in point of a&s;&s;urance, nor could ever enough overcome his natural timidity. His more excellent talents however might, perhaps, have continued the player at Dublin, and lo&s;t the poet at London; but for an accident, which was likely to turn a feigned tragedy into a real one: The &s;tory is this.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="129">
Mr. Farquhar was extremely beloved in Ireland; having the advantage of a good per&s;on, though his voice was weak; he never met with the lea&s;t re|pul&s;e from the audience in any of his perform|ances: He therefore re&s;olved to continue on the &s;tage till &s;omething better &s;hould offer, but his re&s;olution was &s;oon broke by an accident. Being to play the part of Guyomar in Dryden's Indian Emperor, who kills Va&s;quez, one of the Spani&s;h generals; and forgetting to exchange his &s;word for a foil, in the engagement he wounded his bro|ther tragedian, who acted Va&s;quez, very danger|ou&s;ly; and though it proved not mortal, yet it &s;o &s;hocked the natural tenderne&s;s of Mr. Farquhar's temper, that it put a period to his acting ever after.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Mr. Wilks received from Mr. Rich a propo&s;al of four pounds a week, if he would return to London (&s;uch was the extent of the &s;alaries of the be&s;t players in that time, which, in our days, is not equal to that of a &s;econd rate performer) which he thought proper to accept of; and Mr. Farquhar, who now had no inducement to remain at Dublin, accompanied Mr. Wilks to London, in the year 1696. Mr. Wilks, who was well acquainted with the humour and abilities of our author, cea&s;ed not his &s;ollici|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tion 'till he prevailed upon him to write a play, a&s;&s;uring him, that he was con&s;idered by all who knew him in a much brighter light than he had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> yet &s;hewn him&s;elf, and that he was fitter to exhibit entertaining compo&s;itions for the &s;tage, than to eccho tho&s;e of other poets upon it.</P>
<P>But he received &s;till higher encouragement by the patronage of the earl of Orrery, who was a di&s;|corner of merit, and &s;aw, that as yet, Mr. Farquhar's went unrewarded. His lord&s;hip conferred a lieu|tenant's commi&s;&s;ion upon him in his own regiment

<P>In the year 1698, his fir&s;t Comedy called Love and a Bottle appeared on the &s;tage, and for its &s;prightly dialogue, and bu&s;y &s;cenes was well re|ceived by the audience, though Wilks had no part in it.

Towards the latter end of this year we meet with Mr. Farquhar in Holland, probably upon his military duty, from whence he has given a de&s;cription in two of his letters dated that year from Brill, and from Leyden, no le&s;s true than hu|morpus, as well of tho&s;e places as the people; and in a third, dated from the Hague he very face|tiou&s;ly relates how merry he was there, at a treat made by the earl of We&s;tmoreland, while, not only him&s;elf, but king William, and other of his &s;ubjects were detained there by a violent &s;torm, which he has no le&s;s humorou&s;ly de&s;cribed, and has, among his poems, written al&s;o an ingenious copy of ver&s;es to his mi&s;tre&s;s on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Whether this mi&s;tre&s;s was the &s;ame per&s;on he calls his charming Penelope, in &s;everal of his love-letters addre&s;&s;ed to her, we know not, but we have been informed by an old officer in the army, who well knew Mr. Farquhar, that by that name we are to under|&s;tand Mrs. Oldfield, and that the per&s;on meant by Mrs. V&mdash; in one of them, &s;aid to be her bedfellow, was Mrs. Verbruggen the actre&s;s, the &s;ame who was &s;ome years before Mrs. Mountfort, whom Mrs. Oldfield &s;ucceeded, (when Mrs. V&mdash; died &s;ome years after in child-bed) with &s;ingular com|mendation, in her principal parts; and from &s;o bright a flame it was no wonder that Farquhar was more than ordinarily heated.

<P>It is &s;aid, &s;ome of the letters of which we have been &s;peaking, were publi&s;hed from the copies re|turned him at his reque&s;t, by Mrs. Oldfield, and
<PB N="132" REF="135">
that &s;he delighted to read them many years after they were printed, as &s;he al&s;o did the judicious e&s;&s;ay at the end of them, which is called a Di&s;|cour&s;e upon Comedy, in Reference to the Engli&s;h Stage; but what gives a yet more natural and lively repre&s;entation of our author &s;till, is one among tho&s;e letters, which he calls the Picture, containing a de&s;cription and character of him&s;elf, which we &s;hould not now omit tran&s;cribing, if his works were not in every body's hands.</P>
<P>In 1703 came out another Comedy, entitled the Incon&s;tant, or the Way to Win Him, which had &s;ufficient merit to have procured equal &s;ucce&s;s to the re&s;t; but for the inundation of Italian, French, and other farcial interruptions, which, through the intere&s;t of &s;ome, and the depraved ta&s;te of others, broke in upon the &s;tage like a torrent, and &s;wept down before them all ta&s;te for compo&s;itions of a more intrin&s;ic excellence. The&s;e foreign mon&s;ters obtained partizans among&s;t our own countrymen, in oppo&s;ition to Engli&s;h humour, genuine wit, and the &s;ublime efforts of genius, and &s;ub&s;tituted in their room the airy entertainments of dancing and &s;ing|ing, which conveyed no in&s;truction, awakened no generous pa&s;&s;ion, nor filled the brea&s;t with any thing great or manly. Such was the prevalence of the&s;e airy nothings, that our author's comedy was neglected for them, and the tragedy of Phaedra and Hippolitus, which for poetry is equal to any in our tongue, (and though Mr. Addi&s;on wrote the prologue, and Prior the epilogue) was &s;uffered to langui&s;h, while multitudes flocked to hear the warblings of foreign eunuchs, who&s;e highe&s;t excel|lence, as Young expre&s;&s;es it, was,<Q><L>' Non&s;en&s;e well tun'd with &s;weet &s;tupidity.'</L></Q></P>
<P>Very early in the year 1704, a farce called the Stage Coach, in the compo&s;ition whereof he was
<PB N="133" REF="136">
jointly concerned with another, made its fir&s;t appear|ance in print, and it has always given &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Mr. Farquhar had now been about a twelve|month married, and it was at fir&s;t reported, to a great fortune; which indeed he expected, but was mi&s;erably di&s;appointed. The lady had fallen in love with him, and &s;o violent was her pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;he re&s;olved to have him at any rate; and as &s;he knew Farquhar was too much di&s;&s;ipated in life to fall in love, or to think of matrimony unle&s;s advantage was annexed to it, &s;he fell upon the &s;tra|tagem of giving her&s;elf out for a great fortune, and then took an opportunity of letting our poet know that &s;he was in love with him. Vanity and intere&s;t both uniting to per&s;uade Farquhar to mar|ry, he did not long delay it, and, to his immor|tal honour let it be &s;poken, though he found him|&s;elf deceived, his circum&s;tances embarra&s;&s;ed, and his family growing upon him, he never once up|braided her for the cheat, but behaved to her with all the delicacy, and tenderne&s;s of an indulgent hu&s;band.</P>
<P>His next comedy named the Twin-Rivals, was played in 1705.</P>
<P>Our poet was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his commi&s;&s;ion in the army when the Spani&s;h expedition was made under the conduct of the earl of Peterborough, tho' it &s;eems he did not keep it long after, and tho' he was not em|barked in that &s;ervice, or pre&s;ent at the defeat of the French forces, and the conque&s;t of Barcelona; yet from &s;ome military friends in that engagement, he received &s;uch di&s;tinct relations of it in their epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence, that he wrote a poem upon the &s;ubject, in which he has made the earl his hero. Two or three years after it was writ|ten, the impre&s;&s;ion of it was dedicated by the au|thor's widow to the &s;ame nobleman, in which
<PB N="134" REF="137">
are &s;ome ful&s;ome &s;trains of panegyric, which per|haps her nece&s;&s;ity excited her to u&s;e, from a view of enhancing her intere&s;t by flattery, which if ex|cu&s;able at all, is certainly &s;o in a woman left de&s;ti|tute with a family, as &s;he was.</P>
<P>In 1706 a comedy called the Recruiting Officer was acted at the theatre-royal. He dedicates to all friends round the Wrekin, a noted hill near Shrew&s;bury, where he had been to recruit for his company; and where, from his ob&s;ervations on country-life, the manner that &s;erjeants inveigle clowns to enli&s;t, and the behaviour of the officers towards the milk-maids and country - wenches, whom they &s;eldom fail of debauching, he collected matter &s;ufficient to build a comedy upon, and in which he was &s;ucce&s;sful: Even now that comedy fails not to bring full hou&s;es, e&s;pecially when the parts of Captain Plume, Captain Brazen, Sylvia, and Serjeant Kite are properly di&s;po&s;ed of.</P>
<P>His la&s;t play was the Beaux - Stratagem, of which he did not live to enjoy the full &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Of this plea&s;ing author's untimely end, we can give but a melancholy account.</P>
<P>He was oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome debts which o|bliged him to make application to a certain no|ble courtier, who had given him formerly many profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip. He could not bear the thought that his wife and family &s;hould want, and in this perplexity was ready to embrace any expedient for their relief. His pretended patron per&s;uaded him to convert his commi&s;&s;ion into the money he wanted, and pledged his honour, that in a very &s;hort time he would provide him ano|ther. This circum&s;tance appeared favourable, and
<PB N="135" REF="138">
the ea&s;y bard accordingly &s;old his commi&s;&s;ion; but when he renewed his application to the noble|man, and repre&s;ented his needy &s;ituation, the latter had forgot his promi&s;e, or rather, perhaps, had never re&s;olved to fulfil it.</P>
<P>This di&s;tracting di&s;appointment &s;o preyed upon the mind of Mr. Farquhar, who &s;aw nothing but beggary and want before him, that by a &s;ure, tho' not &s;udden declen&s;ion of nature, it carried him off this worldly theatre, while his la&s;t play was acting in the height of &s;ucce&s;s at that of Drury|lane; and tho' the audience be&s;towed the loude&s;t applau&s;es upon the performance, yet they could &s;carce forbear mingling tears with their mirth for the approaching lo&s;s of its author, which hap|pened in the latter end of April 1707, before he was thirty years of age.</P>
<P>Thus having attended our entertaining dramati&s;t o'er the contracted &s;tage of his &s;hort life, thro' the various characters he performed in it, of the player, the lover, and the hu&s;band, the &s;oldier, the critic, and the poet, to his final cata&s;trophe, it is here time to clo&s;e the &s;cene. However, we &s;hall take the liberty to &s;ubjoin a &s;hort character of his works, and &s;ome farther ob&s;ervations on his genius.</P>
<P>It would be injurious to the memory of Wilks not to take notice here, of his generous behaviour to|wards the two daughters of his decea&s;ed friend. He propo&s;ed to his brother managers, (who readily came into it) to give each of them a benefit, to ap|prentice them to mantua-makers; which is an in|&s;tance among&s;t many others that might be produced, of the great worth of that excellent comedian.</P>
<P>The general character which has been given of Mr. Farquhar's comedies is, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That the &s;ucce&s;s of the mo&s;t of them far exceeded the author's ex|pectations; that he was particularly happy in the choice of his &s;ubjects, which he took care to
<PB N="136" REF="139">
adorn with a variety of characters and incident: his &s;tyle is pure and unaffected, his wit natural and flowing, and his plots generally well contrived. He la&s;hed the vices of the age, tho' with a merciful hand; for his mu&s;e was good-natured, not abound|ing over-much with gall, tho' he has been blamed for it by the critics: It has been objected to him, that he was too ha&s;ty in his productions; but by &s;uch only who are admirers of &s;tiff and elabo|rate performances, &s;ince with a per&s;on of a &s;pright|ly fancy, tho&s;e things are often be&s;t, that are &s;truck off in a heat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs, ubi. &s;upra.</NOTE>. It is thought that in all his heroes, he generally &s;ketched out his own character, of a young, gay, raki&s;h &s;park, ble&s;&s;ed with parts and abilities. His works are loo&s;e, tho' not &s;o gro&s;sly libertine, as &s;ome other wits of his time, and leave not &s;o pernicious impre&s;|&s;ions on the imagination as other figures of the like kind more &s;trongly &s;tampt by indelicate and heavier hands.'</Q></P>
<P>He &s;eems to have been a man of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gerius rather &s;prightly than great, rather flow'ry than &s;olid; his comedies are diverting, becau&s;e his characters are natural, and &s;uch as we frequently meet with; but he has u&s;ed no art in drawing them, nor does there appear any force of thinking in his performances, or any deep penetration into nature; but rather a &s;uperficial view, plea&s;ant e|nough to the eye, though capable of leaving no great impre&s;&s;ion on the mind. He drew his ob&s;ervations chiefly from tho&s;e he conver&s;ed with, and has &s;eldom given any additional heightening, or indelible marks to his characters; which was the peculiar excellence of Shake&s;pear, John&s;on and Congreve.</P>
<P>Had he lived to have gained a more general knowledge of life, or had his circum&s;tances not
<PB N="137" REF="140">
been &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aitened, and &s;o prevented his mingling with per&s;ons of rank, we might have &s;een his plays embelli&s;hed with more fini&s;hed characters, and with a more poli&s;h'd dialogue.</P>
<P>He had certainly a lively imagination, but then it was capable of no great compa&s;s; he had wit, but it was of &s;o peculiar a &s;ort, as not to gain ground upon con&s;ideration; and it is certainly true, that his comedies in general owe their &s;ucce&s;s full as much to the player, as to any thing intrin&s;i|cally excellent in them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If he was not a man of the highe&s;t genius, he &s;eems to have had excellent moral qualities, of which his behaviour to his wife and tenderne&s;s to his children are proofs, and de&s;erved a better fate than to die oppre&s;&s;ed with want, and under the calamitous apprehen&s;ions of leaving his fami|ly de&s;titute: While Farquhar will ever be re|membered with plea&s;ure by people of ta&s;te, the name of the courtier who thus inhumanly ruined him, will be for ever dedicated to infamy.</P>

<HEAD>EDWARD RAVENSCROFT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman is author of eleven plays, which gives him a kind of right to be named in this collection. Some have been of o|pinion, he was a poet of a low rate, others that he was only a wit collector; be this as it may, he acquired &s;ome di&s;tinction by the vigorous oppo|&s;ition he made to Dryden: And having cho&s;en &s;o powerful an antagoni&s;t, he has acquired more ho|nour by it, than by all his other works put together; he accu&s;es Dryden of plagiary, and treats him &s;everely.</P>
<P>Mr. Dryden, indeed, had fir&s;t attacked his Mama|mouchi; which provoked Raven&s;croft to retort &s;o har&s;hly upon him; but in the opinion of Mr. Langbain, the charge of plagiari&s;m as properly belonged to Raven&s;croft him&s;elf as to Dryden; tho' there was this e&s;&s;ential difference between the plagiary of one and that of the other; that Dryden turned whatever he borrowed into gold, and Raven&s;croft made u&s;e of other people's mate|rials, without placing them in a new light, or giving them any graces, they had not before.</P>
<P>Raven&s;croft thus proceeds again&s;t Mr. Dryden: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That I may maintain the character of impartial, to which I pretend, I mu&s;t pull off his di&s;gui&s;e, and di&s;cover the politic plagiary that lurks under

it. I know he has endeavoured to &s;hew him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the art of &s;wift writing, and would per|&s;uade the world that what he writes is extempore wit, currente calamo. But I doubt not to &s;hew that tho' he would be thought to imitate the &s;ilk worm that &s;pins its webb from its own bowels. yet I &s;hall make him appear like the leech that lives upon the blood of men, drawn from the gums, and when he is rubbed with &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t, &s;pues it up again. To prove this, I &s;hall only give an account of his plays, and by that little of my own knowledge, that I &s;hall di&s;cover, it will be manife&s;t, that this rickety poet, (tho' of &s;o ma|ny years) cannot go without others a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for take this prophecy from your humble &s;er|vant, or Mr. Raven&s;croft's Mamamouchi, which you plea&s;e,'<Q><L>' When once our poet's tran&s;lating vein is pa&s;t,</L>
<L>' From him, you can't expect new plays in ha&s;te.</L></Q></Q></P>
<P>Thus far Mr. Raven&s;croft has cen&s;ured Dryden; and Langbain, in order to prove him guilty of the &s;ame poetical depredation, has been indu&s;trious to trace the plots of his plays, and the &s;imilarity of his characters with tho&s;e of other dramatic poets; but as we &s;hould reck on it tedious to follow him in this manner, we &s;hall only in general take notice of tho&s;e novels from which he has drawn his plots.</P>
<P>We cannot a&s;certain the year in which this man died; he had been bred a templer, which he for&s;ook as a dry unentertaining &s;tudy, and much beneath the genius of a poet.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN PHILIPS,</HEAD>
<P>A POET of very con&s;iderable eminence, was &s;on of Dr. Stephen Philips, arch-deacon of Salop, and born at Brampton in Oxford&s;hire, Decem|ber 30, 1676. After he had received a grammatical education at home, he was &s;ent to Winche&s;ter &s;chool, where he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Latin and Greek languages, and was &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed for an happy imitation of the excellences which he di&s;covered in the be&s;t cla&s;&s;ical authors. With this foundation he was removed to Chri&s;t's Church in Oxford, where he performed all his univer&s;ity exerci&s;es with applau&s;e, and be&s;ides other valuable authors in the poetical way, he became particularly ac|quainted with, and &s;tudied the works of Milton. The ingenious Mr. George Sewel, in his life and character of our author, ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that there was not an allu&s;ion in Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t, drawn from the thoughts and expre&s;&s;ions of Homer or Virgil, which Mr. Philips could not immediately refer to, and by that he perceived what a peculiar life and grace their &s;entiments added to Engli&s;h poetry; how much their images rai&s;ed its &s;pirit, and what weight and beauty their words, when tran&s;lated, gave to its language: nor was he le&s;s curious in ob&s;erving the force and elegance of his mother tongue; but by the example of his darling Milton, &s;earched backwards into the
<PB N="144" REF="147">
works of our old Engli&s;h poets, to furni&s;h him with proper &s;ounding, and &s;ignificant expre&s;&s;ions, and prove the due extent, and compa&s;s of the language. For this purpo&s;e he carefully read over Chancer and Spen&s;er, and afterwards, in his writings, did not &s;cruple to revive any words or phra&s;es which he thought de&s;erved it, with that mode&s;ty, and liberty which Horace allows of, either in the coining of new, or the re&s;tor|ing of ancient expre&s;&s;ions.'</Q> Our author, how|ever, was not &s;o much enamoured of poetry, as to neglect other parts of literature, but was very well acquainted with the whole compa&s;s of natu|ral philo&s;ophy. He &s;eems in his &s;tudies, as well as his writings, to have made Virgil his pattern, and often to have broken out with him in the fol|lowing rapturous wi&s;h, in the Second Book of the Georgics, which, for the &s;ake of the Engli&s;h read|er, we &s;hall give in Mr. Dryden's tran&s;lation.<Q><L>' Give me the ways of wand'ring &s;tars to know,</L>

<P>Mr. Philips was a pa&s;&s;ionate admirer of nature, and it is not improbable but he drew his own character in that de&s;cription which he gives of a philo&s;ophical and retired life, at the latter end of the fir&s;t Book of his Cyder.<Q><L>&mdash;He to his labour hies,</L>

<P>While Mr. Philips continued at the univer&s;ity, he was honoured with the acquaintance of the be&s;t and polite&s;t men in it, and had a particular intima|cy with Mr. Edmund Smith, author of Phaedra and Hippolitus. The fir&s;t poem which got him reputa|tion, was his Splendid Shilling, which the author of the Tatler has &s;tiled the be&s;t burle&s;que poem in the Engli&s;h Language; nor was it only, &s;ays Mr. Sewel, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the fine&s;t of that kind in our tongue, but handled in a manner quite different from what had been made u&s;e of by any author of our own, or other nation, the &s;entiments, and &s;tile being in this both new; whereas in tho&s;e, the je&s;t lies more in allu&s;ions to the thoughts and &s;ables of the ancients, than in the pomp of expre&s;&s;ion.

Out of that variety of circum&s;tances, which his fruitful invention mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t to him, on &s;uch a &s;ubject, he has not cho&s;en any but what are diverting to every reader, and &s;ome, that none but his inimitable dre&s;s could have made di|verting to any: when we read it, we are betrayed into a plea&s;ure which we could not expect, tho' at the &s;ame time the &s;ublimity of the &s;tile, and the gravity of the phra&s;e, &s;eem to cha&s;ti&s;e that laughter which they provoke.'</Q> Mr. Edmund Smith in his beautiful ver&s;es on our Author's Death, &s;peaks thus concerning this poem;<Q><L>' In her be&s;t light the comic mu&s;e appears,</L>

The &s;tile &s;eems to be unnatural for a poem which is intended to rai&s;e laughter; for that laboured gravity has rather a contrary influence; di&s;po&s;ing the mind to be &s;erious: and the di&s;ap|pointment is not &s;mall, when a man finds he has been betrayed into &s;olemn thinking, in reading the de&s;cription of a trifle; if the gravity of the phra&s;e cha&s;ti&s;es the laughter, the purpo&s;e of the poem is defeated, and it is a rule in writing to &s;uit the language to the &s;ubject.

<P>Our author's coming to London, we are in|formed, was owing to the per&s;ua&s;ion of &s;ome great per&s;ons, who engaged him to write on the Battle of Blenheim; his poem upon which introduced him to the earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> afterwards lord vi&s;count Bolingbroke, and other noble patrons.

<P>The next poem of our author was his Cyder, the plan of which he laid at Oxford, and afterwards compleated it in London. He was de|termined to make choice of this &s;ubject, from the violent pa&s;&s;ion he had for the productions of nature, and to do honour to his native country. The poem was founded upon the model of Virgil's Georgics, and approaches pretty near it, which, in the opinion of critics in general, and Mr. Dry|den in particular, even excels the Divine Aeneid: He imitates Virgil rather like a pur&s;uer, than a follower, not &s;ervilely tracing, but emulating his beauties; his conduct and management are &s;uperior to all other copiers of that original, and even the admired Rapin (&s;ays Dr. Sewel) is much be|low

<HEAD>WILLIAM WALSH, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS poet was the &s;on of Jo&s;eph Wal&s;h, of Aberley in Worce&s;ter&s;hire. He became a gentleman-commoner of Wadham-College Ox|ford, in Ea&s;ter-Term, 1678, when he was only fifteen years of age; he le&s;t it without a degree, re|tired to his native county, and &s;ome time after went to London. He wrote a Dialogue concerning Wo|men, being a Defence of the Fair-Sex, addre&s;&s;ed to Eugenia, and printed in the year 1691. This is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of our author's productions, and it will be &s;omewhat nece&s;&s;ary to take further notice of it, which we cannot more effectually do, than by tran&s;cribing the words of Dryden in its commendation.&mdash;That great critic thus characteri&s;es it. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The peru&s;al of this dialogue, in defence of the Fair-Sex, written by a gentleman of my ac|quaintance, much &s;urpri&s;ed me: For it was not ea&s;y for me to imagine, that one &s;o young could have treated &s;o nice a &s;ubject with &s;o much judg|ment. It is true, I was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious, and that he had improved him&s;elf by travelling; and from thence I might rea&s;onably have expected, that air of gallantry which is &s;o vi&s;ibly diffu&s;ed through the body of the work, and is, indeed, the &s;oul that animates all things of this nature; but &s;o much variety of reading, both in antient and modern authors, &s;uch dige&s;tion of that reading, &s;o much ju&s;tne&s;s of thought, that it leaves no room for affectation or pedantry; I may venture to &s;ay, are not over com|mon among&s;t practi&s;ed writers, and very rarely to

be found among&s;t beginners. It puts me in mind of what was &s;aid of Mr. Waller, the father of our Engli&s;h numbers, upon the &s;ight of his fir&s;t ver&s;es, by the wits of the la&s;t age; that he came out into the world forty-thou&s;and &s;trong, before they had heard of him. Here in imitation of my friend's apo&s;trophes, I hope the reader need not be told, that Mr. Waller is only mentioned for honour's &s;ake, that I am de&s;irous of laying hold on his memory on all occa&s;ions, and thereby ac|knowledging to the world, that unle&s;s he had written, none of us all could write.

I am not &s;o pre&s;uming, as to think my opinion can either be his touch-&s;tone, or his pa&s;s|port; but, I thought I might &s;end him back to Ario&s;to, who has made it the bu&s;ine&s;s of almo&s;t thirty &s;tanza's, in the beginning of the thirty-&s;eventh book of his Orlando Furio&s;o; not only to prai&s;e that beautiful part of the creation, but al&s;o to make a &s;harp &s;atire on their enemies; to give mankind their own, and to tell them plainly, that from their envy it proceeds, that the virtue and great actions of women are purpo&s;ely conceal|ed. and the failings of &s;ome few among&s;t them expo&s;ed, with all the aggravating circum&s;tances of malice. For my own part, who have always been their &s;ervant, and have never drawn my pen again&s;t them, I had rather &s;ee &s;ome of them prai&s;ed extraordinarily, than any of them &s;uffer by detraction, and that at this age, and at this time particularly, wherein I find more he|roines, than heroes; let me therefore give them joy of their new champion: If any will think me more partial to him, than I really am, they can only &s;ay, I have returned his bribe; and

the wor&s;t I wi&s;h him is, that he may receive ju|&s;tice from the men, and favour only from the ladies.'</Q></P>
<P>This is the opinion of Mr. Dryden in favour of this piece, which is &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h its repu|tation. Mr. Wood, the antiquarian, ob&s;erves, that this Eugenia was the mi&s;tre&s;s of Wal&s;h, but for this he produces no proof, neither is it in the lea&s;t material whether the circum&s;tance is true or no. Mr. Wal&s;h is likewi&s;e author of &s;everal occa&s;ional poems, printed 1749, among&s;t the works of the Minor Poets, and which he fir&s;t publi&s;hed in the year 1692, with &s;ome letters amorous and gal|lant, to which is prefixed the following addre&s;s to the public.<Q><L>Go, little book, and to the world impart</L>

Mr. Wal&s;h was of an amorous complexion, and in one of his letters mentions three of his amours, in pretty &s;ingular terms.

However, from this time forward, upon what follies &s;oever you fall, be plea&s;ed, for my &s;ake, to &s;pare tho&s;e of love; being very well &s;atisfied there is not one folly of that kind (excepting marriage) which I have not already committed. I have been, without raillery, in love with the beauty of a woman whom I have never &s;een; with the wit of one whom I never heard &s;peak, nor &s;een any thing &s;he has written, and with the heroic vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tues of a woman, without knowing any one action of her, that could make me think &s;he had any; Cupid will have it &s;o, and what can weak mortals do again&s;t &s;o potent a god?'</Q> Such were the &s;entiments of our author when he was about 30 years of age.</P>

In the year 1714 the public were obliged with a &s;mall po&s;thumous piece of Mr. Wal&s;h's, entitled Ae&s;culapius, or the Ho&s;pital of Fools, in imitation of Lucian. There is printed among&s;t Mr. Wal&s;h's other performances, in a volume of the Minor Poets, an E&s;&s;ay on Pa&s;toral Poetry, with a Short Defence of Virgil, again&s;t &s;ome of the reflexions of M. Fontenell&eacute;. That critic had cen&s;ured Virgil for writing his pa&s;torals in a too courtly &s;tile, which, he &s;ays, is not proper for the Doric Mu&s;e; but Mr. Wal&s;h has very judiciou&s;ly &s;hewn, that the Shepherds in Virgil's time, were held in greater e&s;timation, and were per&s;ons of a much &s;uperior figure to what they are now. We are too apt to figure the ancient countrymen like our own, lead|ing a painful life in poverty, and contempt, with|out wit, or courage, or education; but men had quite different notions of the&s;e things for the fir&s;t four thou&s;and years of the world. Health and &s;trength were then more in e&s;teem, than the refinements of plea&s;ure, and it was accounted more honourable to till the ground, and keep a flock of &s;heep, than to di&s;&s;olve in wantonne&s;s, and effeminating &s;loth.</P>

<P>ALMOST every circum&s;tance relating to the life of this celebrated actor, is expo&s;ed to di&s;|pute, and his manner of fir&s;t coming on the &s;tage, as well as the action of his younger years have been controverted. He was &s;on of Mr. Betterton, under|cook to king Charles the I&s;t, and was born in Tothill|&s;treet We&s;tmin&s;ter, &s;ome time in the year 1635. Having received the rudiments of a genteel educa|tion, and di&s;covering a great propen&s;ity to books, it was once propo&s;ed he &s;hould have been educated to &s;ome learned profe&s;&s;ion; but the violence and con|fu&s;ion of the times putting this out of the power of his family, he was at his own reque&s;t bound appren|tice to a book&s;eller, one Mr. Holden, a man of &s;ome eminence, and then happy in the friend&s;hip of Sir William Davenant. In the year 1656 it is pro|bable Mr. Betterton made his fir&s;t appearance on the &s;tage, under the direction of Sir William, at the Opera-hou&s;e in Charter-hou&s;e-yard. It is &s;aid, that going frequently to the &s;tage about his ma&s;ter's bu&s;i|ne&s;s, gave Betterton the fir&s;t notion of it, who &s;hewed &s;uch indications of a theatrical genius, that Sir William readily accepted him as a performer. Im|mediately after the re&s;toration two di&s;tinct compa|nies
<PB N="157" REF="160">
were formed by royal authority; the fir&s;t in virtue of a patent granted to Henry Killegrew <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> called the king's company, the other in virtue of a patent granted to Sir William Davenant, which was &s;tiled the duke's company<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cibber's Apology.</NOTE>. The former acted at the theatre royal in Drury-lane, the other at that in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. In order that the theatres might be decorated to the utmo&s;t advantage, and want none of the embelli&s;hments u&s;ed abroad, Mr. Betterton, by command of Charles II. went to Paris, to take a view of the French &s;tage, that he might the better judge what would contribute to the improvement of our own. Upon his return, Mr. Betterton introduced moving &s;cenes into our theatre, which before had the &s;tage only hung with tape&s;try. The &s;cenes no doubt help the repre&s;enta|tion, by giving the &s;pectator a view of the place, and increa&s;e the di&s;tre&s;s, by making the deception more powerful, and afflicting the mind with greater &s;en&s;ibility. The theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields being very inconvenient, another was built for them in Dor&s;et-Garden, called the duke's theatre, to which they removed and followed their profe&s;&s;ion with great &s;ucce&s;s, during all that reign of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The &s;tage at this time was &s;o much the care of the &s;tate, that when any di&s;putes aro&s;e, they were generally decided by his maje&s;ty him&s;elf or the duke of York, and &s;requently canva&s;&s;ed in the circle. Mr. Cibber a&s;&s;igns very good rea&s;ons, why at this time, theatrical amu&s;ements were &s;o much in vogue; the fir&s;t is, that after a long eclip&s;e of gallantry during the rage of the civil war, people returned to it with double ardour; the next is, that women were then introduced on the &s;tage, their parts formerly being &s;upplied by boys, or effeminate young men, of which the famous Kyna&s;ton po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the capital parts. When any art is carried to perfection, it &s;el|dom happens, that at that particular period, the

profits ari&s;ing from it are high; and at this time the advantages of playing were very incon&s;iderable: Mr. Hart the greate&s;t performer at the king's thea|tre, had but three pounds a week, and Mr. Better|ton, then but young, very probably had not &s;o much, and be&s;ides, benefits then were things unheard of.</P>
<P>In 1670 Mr. Betterton married a gentlewoman on the &s;ame &s;tage, one Mrs. Saunder&s;on, who ex|celled as an actre&s;s, every thing but her own con|duct in life.

<P>After Sir William Davenant's death, the patent came into the hands of his &s;on, Dr. Charles Dave|nant, &s;o well known to the world by his political writings; but, whether his genius was le&s;s fit than his father's for &s;uch an admini&s;tration, or the king's company were really &s;uperior to his in acting, we cannot determine; but they gained upon the town, and Dr. Davenant was obliged to have recour&s;e to the dramatic opera, rich &s;cenes, and fine mu&s;ic, to &s;upport the &s;tage on which Betterton played. The Dr. him&s;elf wrote the Opera of Circe, which came fir&s;t on the &s;tage in 1675, and was received with &s;uch applau&s;e, as gave hopes of &s;ucceeding in this new way. The &s;ame year a Pa&s;toral, called Cali&s;ta, or the Cha&s;te Nymph, written by Mr. Crowne, at the de&s;ire of queen Katherine, was repre&s;ented at court; and the ladies, Mary and Anne, daughters to the duke of York, played parts in it. On this occa|&s;ion Mr. Betterton in&s;tructed the actors, and Mrs. Betterton gave le&s;&s;ons to the prince&s;&s;es; in grateful remembrance of which queen Anne &s;ettled a pen&s;ion of 100 l. per annum upon her. During this time an emulation &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two companies, and
<PB N="159" REF="162">
a theatrical war was proclaimed aloud, in which the town reaped the advantage, by &s;eeing the parts per|formed with the greater life. The duke's company however maintained it's &s;uperiority, by means of the new invented artillery, of mu&s;ic, machines, and &s;cenery, and other underhand dealings, and bribing of actors in the oppo&s;ite faction from performing their duty. By the&s;e mea&s;ures, a coalition was ef|fected, and the two companies joined together, and being united formed one of the perfecte&s;t that ever filled a &s;tage, in 1682. It was in this united com|pany that the merit of Betterton &s;hone with unri|valled lu&s;tre, and having &s;urvived the great actors on who&s;e model he had formed him&s;elf, he was at liberty to di&s;cover his genius in its full extent, by re|placing many of them with advantage in the&s;e very characters, in which, during their life-times, they had been thought inimitable; and all who have a ta&s;te for &s;cenical entertainments cannot but thank the pre&s;ent laureat, for pre&s;erving for them &s;o lively a portrait of Betterton, and painting him in &s;o true a light, that without the imputation of blind adulation, he may be ju&s;tly &s;tiled the Briti&s;h Ro&s;cius.</P>
<P>This account is too important and picture&s;que to be here omitted; and it would be an injury to Bet|terton not to &s;hew him in that commanding light, in which the be&s;t judge of that &s;pecies of excellence has placed him. <Q REND="inline"><P>"Betterton was an actor, as Shake&s;pear was an author, both without competitors! form'd for the mu|tual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and illu&s;tration of each others genius! how Shake&s;pear wrote, all men who have a ta&s;te for nature may read, and know&mdash;but with what high|er rapture would he &s;till be read, could they con|ceive how Betterton play'd him! then might they know, the one was born alone to &s;peak what the other only knew to write! Pity it is, that the mo|mentary
<PB N="160" REF="163">
beauties flowing from an harmonious elocu|tion cannot, like tho&s;e of poetry, be their own re|cord! that the animated graces of the player can live no longer than the in&s;tant breath and motion that pre&s;ents them; or at be&s;t can but &s;aintly glimmer through the memory, or imperfect atte&s;tation of a few &s;urviving &s;pectators. Could how Betterton &s;poke, be as ea&s;ily known as what he &s;poke; then might you &s;ee the mu&s;e of Shake&s;pear in her tri|umph, with all their beauties in their be&s;t array, ri&s;ing into real life, and charming her beholders. But alas! &s;ince all this is &s;o far out of the reach of de&s;cription, how &s;hall I &s;hew you Betterton? Should I therefore tell you, that all the Othellos, Hamlets, Hot&s;purs, Mackbeths, and Brutus's, whom you may have &s;een &s;ince his time have fallen far &s;hort of him: This &s;till would give you no idea of his parti|cular excelience. Let us &s;ee then what a particular compari&s;on may do! whether that may yet draw him nearer to you?</P>
<P>You have &s;een a Hamlet perhaps, who, on the fir&s;t appearance of his father's &s;pirit, has thrown him&s;elf into all the &s;training vociferation requi&s;ite to expre&s;s rage and fury, and the hou&s;e has thundered with ap|plau&s;e; tho' the mi&s;guided actor was all the while (as Shake&s;pear terms it) tearing a pa&s;&s;ion into rags&mdash;I am the more bold to offer you this particular in|&s;tance, becau&s;e the late Mr. Addi&s;on, while I &s;ate by him, to &s;ee this &s;cene acted, made the &s;ame ob|&s;ervation, a&s;king me with &s;ome &s;urprize, if I thought Hamlet &s;hould be in &s;o violent a pa&s;&s;ion with the Gho&s;t, which though it might have a&s;toni&s;hed, it had not provok'd him? for you may ob&s;erve that in this beautiful &s;peech, the pa&s;&s;ion never ri&s;es be|yond an almo&s;t breathle&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment, or an im|patience, limited by filial reverence, to enquire into the &s;u&s;pected wrongs that may have rais'd him from his peaceful tomb! and a de&s;ire to know what a &s;pi|rit &s;o &s;eemingly di&s;tre&s;t, might wi&s;n or enjoin a &s;or|rowful
<PB N="161" REF="164">
&s;on to execute towards his future quiet in the grave? this was the light into which Betterton threw this &s;cene; which he open'd with a pau&s;e of mute amazement! then ri&s;ing &s;lowly, to a &s;olemn, trem|bling voice, he made the Gho&s;t equally terrible to the &s;pectator, as to him&s;elf! and in the de&s;criptive part of the natural emotions which the gha&s;tly vi&s;ion gave him, the boldne&s;s of his expo&s;tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ation was &s;till governed by decency, manly, but not braving; his voice never ri&s;ing into that &s;eeming outrage, or wild defiance of what he naturally rever'd. But alas! to pre&s;erve this medium, between mouthing, and meaning too little, to keep the attention more plea|&s;ingly awake, by a tempered &s;pirit, than by meer vehemence of voice, is of all the ma&s;ter-&s;trokes of an actor the mo&s;t difficult to reach. In this none yet have equall'd Betterton. But I am unwilling to &s;hew his &s;uperiority only by recounting the errors of tho&s;e, who now cannot an&s;wer to them; let their farther failings therefore be forgotten! or rather &s;hall I in &s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;e them? for I am not yet &s;ure, that they might not be as much owing to the fal&s;e judgment of the &s;pectator, as the actor. While the million are &s;o apt to be tran&s;ported, when the drum of their ear is &s;o roundly rattled; while they take the life of elocution to lie in the &s;trength of the lungs, it is no wonder the actor, who&s;e end is applau&s;e, &s;hould be &s;o often tempted, at this ea&s;y rate, to excite it. Shall I go a little farther? and allow that this extreme is more pardonable than its oppo&s;ite error. I mean that dangerous affectation of the monotone, or &s;olemn &s;amene&s;s of pronuncia|tion, which to my ear is in&s;upportable; for of all faults that &s;o frequently pa&s;s upon the vulgar, that of flatne&s;s will have the fewe&s;t admirers. That this is an error of ancient &s;tanding &s;eems evident by what Hamlet &s;ays, in his in&s;tructions to the players, viz.<Q><PB N="162" REF="165">
Be not too tame, neither, &amp;c.</Q></P>

<P>The Actor, doubtle&s;s, is as &s;trongly ty'd down to the rule of Horace, as the writer.<Q><L>Si vis me flere, dolendum e&s;t</L>
<L>Primum ip&s;i tibi&mdash;</L></Q> He that feels not him&s;elf the pa&s;&s;ion he would rai&s;e, will talk to a &s;leeping audience: But this never was the fault of Betterton; and it has often amaz'd me, to &s;ee tho&s;e who &s;oon came after him, throw out in &s;ome parts of a character, a ju&s;t and graceful &s;pirit, which Betterton him&s;elf could not but have applauded. And yet in the equally &s;hining pa&s;&s;ages of the &s;ame character, have heavily dragg'd the &s;en|timent along, like a dead weight; with a long ton'd voice, and ab&s;ent eye, as if they had fairly forgot what they were about: If you have never made this ob&s;ervation, I am contented you &s;hould not know where to apply it.</P>
<P>A farther excellence in Betterton, was that he could vary his &s;pirit to the different characters he acted. Tho&s;e wild impatient &s;tarts, that fierce and fla&s;hing fire, which he threw into Hot&s;pur, never came from the unruffled temper of his Brutus (for I have more than once &s;een a Brutus as warm as Hot|&s;pur) when the Betterton Brutus was provoked, in his di&s;pute with Ca&s;&s;ius, his &s;pirit flew only to his eye; his &s;teady look alone &s;upply'd that terror, which he di&s;dain'd, an intemperance in his voice &s;hould ri&s;e to. Thus, with a &s;ettled dignity of con|tempt, like an unheeding rock, he repell'd upon him&s;elf the foam of Ca&s;&s;ius. Perhaps the very words of Shake&s;pear will better let you into my meaning:<Q><PB N="163" REF="166"><L>Mu&s;t I give way, and room, to your ra&s;h choler?</L>
<L>Shall I be frighted when a madman &s;tares?</L></Q> And a little after,<Q><L>There is no terror, Ca&s;&s;ius, in your looks! &amp;c.</L></Q> Not but, in &s;ome part of this &s;cene, where he re|proaches Ca&s;&s;ius, his temper is not under this &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion, but opens into that warmth which becomes a man of virtue; yet this is that ha&s;ty &s;park of anger, which Brutus him&s;elf endeavours to excu&s;e.</P>
<P>But with whatever &s;trength of nature we &s;ee the poet &s;hew, at once, the philo&s;opher and the heroe, yet the image of the actor's excellence will be &s;till imperfect to you, unle&s;s language cou'd put colours in our words to paint the voice with.</P>
<P>Et &s;i vis &s;imilem pingere, pinge &s;onum, is enjoin|ing an impo&s;&s;ibility. The mo&s;t that a Vandyke can arrive at, is to make his portraits of great per&s;ons &s;eem to think; a Shake&s;pear goes farther yet, and tells you what his pictures thought; a Betterton &s;teps beyond 'em both, and calls them from the grave, to breathe, and be them&s;elves again, in feature, &s;peech, and motion. When the &s;kilful actor &s;hews you all the&s;e powers united, he gratifies at once your eye, your ear, and your under&s;tanding. To conceive the plea&s;ure ri&s;ing from &s;uch harmony, you mu&s;t have been pre&s;ent at it! 'tis not to be told you!"</P></Q></P>
<P>Thus was Betterton happy in his fortune, in the notice of his &s;overeign, in his fame and character, and in a general re&s;pect of all ranks of life; thus happy might he have continued, had he not, been per&s;uaded to attempt becoming rich, and unluckily engaged in a &s;cheme that &s;wept away all his capital, and left him in real di&s;tre&s;s. This accident fell out in 1692; and is of too particular a kind to pa&s;s un|noticed.
<PB N="164" REF="167">
Mr. Betterton had a great many friends among&s;t the wealthy traders in the city, and &s;o amiable was his private life, that all who knew him were concerned, and intere&s;ted in his &s;ucce&s;s: A|mong&s;t the&s;e, there was a gentleman, who&s;e name the author of his life thinks proper to conceal, who entered into the &s;tricte&s;t amity with this actor. This gentleman in the year 1692 was concerned in an adventure to the Ea&s;t-Indies, upon the footing then allowed by the company's charter, which ve&s;&s;els &s;o employed were &s;tiled interlopers. The project of &s;ucce&s;s was great, the gain unu&s;ually high; and this induced Mr. Betterton, to whom his friend offered any &s;hare in the bu&s;ine&s;s he plea&s;ed, to think of &s;o large a &s;um as eight-thou&s;and pounds; but it was not for him&s;elf, as he had no &s;uch &s;um in his power: and whoever con&s;iders the &s;ituation of the &s;tage at that time will need no other argument to convince him of it. Yet he had another friend whom he was willing to oblige, which was the famous Dr. Rad|cliffe; &s;o Mr. Betterton advanced &s;omewhat more than two-thou&s;and pounds, which was his all, and the Dr. made it up eight-thou&s;and. The ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and made as pro&s;perous a voyage as tho&s;e concerned in her could wi&s;h, and the war with France being then very warm, the captain very prudently came home north about, and arrived &s;afe in Ireland; but in his pa&s;&s;age from thence he was taken by the French. His cargo was upwards of 120, 000 l. which ruined Mr. Betterton, and broke the fortune and heart of his friend in the city: As for doctor Radcliffe, he expre&s;&s;ed great concern for Mr. Betterton, but none for him&s;elf; the Dr. merrily con&s;oled him&s;elf with ob&s;erving, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that it was only trotting up 200 pair of &s;tairs more, and things are as they were.'</Q></P>
<P>This accident, however fatal to Mr. Betterton's fortune, yet proved not &s;o to his peace, for he bore it without murmur, and even without mention; &s;o
<PB N="165" REF="168">
far from entertaining re&s;entment again&s;t his friend in the city, who doubtle&s;s meant him well, he con|tinued his intimacy till his death, and after his de|cea&s;e took his only daughter under his protection, and watched over her education till &s;he thought pro|per to di&s;po&s;e of her&s;elf in marriage to Mr. Bowman the player, who&s;e behaviour was &s;uch, as to gain the e&s;teem of all that knew him; he has not been many years dead, and reflected credit on the re|ports of the excellency of the old &s;tage.</P>
<P>Such the virtue, &s;uch the honour of Mr. Betterton! who in his private character was as amiable as any he borrowed from the poets, and therefore was always de&s;ervedly con&s;idered as the head of the theatre, though ve&s;ted there with very little power. The managers, as the companies were now united, exerci&s;ed the mo&s;t de&s;potic &s;tage-tyranny; and o|bliged our author to remon&s;trate to them the hard|&s;hips they inflicted on their actors, and repre&s;ent that bad policy of the few, forgetting their obliga|tions to the many. This language in the ears of the theatrical mini&s;try, &s;ounded like trea&s;on; and therefore, in&s;tead of con&s;idering how to remedy the mi&s;chiefs complained of, they bent their thoughts to get rid of their monitor: as if the not hearing of faults was equivalent to mending them. It was with this view they began to give away &s;ome of Betterton's fir&s;t parts to young actors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cibber's Life.</NOTE>, &s;uppo&s;ing this would abate his influence. This policy ruined them, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him: The public refented their having plays ill acted when they knew they might have better.</P>
<P>The be&s;t players attached them&s;elves wholly to Betterton, and de&s;ired him to turn his thoughts on &s;ome method of procuring him&s;elf and them ju&s;tice. Thus theatrical de&s;poti&s;m produced its own de|&s;truction, and the very &s;teps taken to render Better|ton
<PB N="166" REF="169">
de&s;perate, pointed out the way for his de|liverance. Mr. Betterton, who had a general acquaintance with people of fa&s;hion, repre&s;ent|ed his ca&s;e to them, and at la&s;t by the interpo|&s;ition of the earl of Dor&s;et, a patent was grant|ed him for building a new play-hou&s;e in Lin|coln's-Inn-Fields, which he effected by a &s;ub&s;crip|tion. The patentees, in order to make head again&s;t them, got over to their party Mr. Williams, and Mrs. Mountford, both eminent players; they had al&s;o recruits from the country, but with all the art of which they were capable, they continued &s;till unequal to Mr. Betterton's company. The new theatre was opened in 1695, with very great advan|tages: Mr. Congreve accepted of a &s;hare with this company, as Mr. Dryden had formerly with the king's; and the fir&s;t play they acted was Congreve's Comedy of Love for Love. The king honoured it with his pre&s;ence, there was a large and &s;plendid audience, Mr. Betterton &s;poke a Prologue, and Mrs. Bracegirdle an Epilogue &s;uited to the occa&s;ion, and it appeared by the reception they met with, that the town knew how to reward the merit of tho&s;e the patentees u&s;ed &s;o ill. But with all the&s;e va&s;t advantages, Betterton's company were not able to maintain this flow of pro&s;perity, beyond two or three &s;ea&s;ons: Mr. Congreve was a &s;low writer, Vanbrugh, and Mr. Cibber, who wrote for the other hou&s;e, were more expeditious; and if they did not fini&s;h, they at lea&s;t writ plea&s;ing Comedies.</P>
<P>The frequency of new-pieces, however, gave &s;uch a turn in their favour, that Betterton's company with all their merit, had been undone, had not the Mourning Bride, and the Way of the World, come like reprieves, and &s;aved them from the la&s;t ga&s;p<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cibber's Life.</NOTE>. In a few years however, it appearing plainly, that without a new &s;upport from their friends, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for them to maintain their &s;uperiority, or
<PB N="167" REF="170">
independance; the patrons of Mr. Betterton &s;et about a new &s;ub&s;cription, for building a theatre in the Hay-market, under the direction of Sir John Vanbrugh, which was fini&s;hed in 1706<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Vanbrugh's Life.</NOTE>; and was to be conducted upon a new plan; mu&s;ic and &s;cenery to be intermixed with the drama, which with the novelty of a new hou&s;e, was likely to retrieve Mr. Betterton's affairs. This favour was kindly received by Mr. Betterton; but he was now grown old, his health and &s;trength much impaired by con&s;tant application, and his fortune &s;till wor&s;e than his health; he cho&s;e therefore (as a mutinous &s;pirit, occa&s;ioned by di&s;appointments, grew up among&s;t the actors) to decline the offer, and &s;o put the whole de&s;ign under the conduct of Sir John Vanbrugh, and Mr. Congreve, the latter of whom &s;oon abandoned it entirely; and Mr. Bet|terton's &s;trength failing, many of the old players dying, and other accidents intervening, a reunion of the companies became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;oon after took place.</P>
<P>Hitherto, Betterton is con&s;idered as at the head of his company, and the affairs of the &s;tage are na|turally connected with his, as the tran&s;actions of a nation are interwoven with the life of a prince. After our author reached &s;eventy, his infirmities grew upon him greatly, his fits of the gout were more la&s;ting, and more &s;evere: His circum&s;tances al&s;o, which had not been mended &s;ince he took up|on him the conduct of the theatre, grew more ne|ce&s;&s;itous, and all this joined to his wife's ill &s;tate of health, made his condition melancholy, at a time when the highe&s;t affluence could not have made them chearful. Yet under all the&s;e pre&s;&s;ures, he kept up his &s;pirit, and though le&s;s active, was as &s;erene as ever. The public in tho&s;e days, had a grateful remembrance of the plea&s;ure Betterton had given
<PB N="168" REF="171">
them, and would not &s;uffer &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed, and &s;o de&s;erving a man, after fifty-years &s;ervice, to with|draw, till he had received from them &s;ome marks of their favour.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1709 a benefit was granted to Mr. Betterton, and the play of Love for Love was acted for that purpo&s;e. Two of the be&s;t actre&s;&s;es that ever graced the &s;tage appeared on it upon that occa|&s;ion, tho' they had long quitted it, to render the bene|fit more advantageous: The part of Valentine was performed by Mr. Betterton, Angelica by Mrs. Bracegirdle, and Mrs. Barry performed that of Frail. The epilogue was written by Mr. Rowe. Mrs. Bracegirdle, Mrs. Barry, and Mr. Betterton, ap|peared on the &s;tage together, and the ladies taking hold of him, repre&s;ented his infirmities of age, and pleaded his ancient merit, in a very natural and moving manner: This epilogue is exqui&s;ite in its kind. The profits ari&s;ing from that benefit, we are told, amounted to 500 l. He had al&s;o a promi&s;e that the favour &s;hould be annually continued.</P>
<P>The&s;e extraordinary acts of public gratitude had a proper effect upon Mr. Betterton; who in&s;tead of indulging him&s;elf on their bounty, exerted the &s;pirit given by this genero&s;ity, in their &s;ervice, and appeared and acted as often as his health would permit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the &s;tage.</NOTE>. On the 20th of September following, in particular, he performed the part of Hamlet, with &s;uch vivacity, as well as ju&s;tice, that it gave ample &s;atisfaction to the be&s;t judges. This activity in the winter kept off the gout longer than u&s;ual, but the fit returning in the &s;pring, was the more unlucky, as it happened at the time of his benefit, when the &s;ucce&s;s of his play was &s;ure to depend in a great mea&s;ure upon his own performance. The play he made choice of was the Maid's Tragedy, in
<PB N="169" REF="172">
which he acted the part of Melantius; and notice was accordingly given by his good friend the Tatler; but the fit intervened; and that he might not di&s;|appoint the town, Mr. Betterton was forced to &s;ub|mit to outward applications, to reduce the &s;welling of his feet: Which had &s;uch an effect, that he was able to appear on the &s;tage, though he was obliged to u&s;e a &s;lipper. He acted that day, &s;ays the Laureat, with unu&s;ual &s;pirit, and bri&s;kne&s;s, by which he obtained univer&s;al applau&s;e; but this could not prevent his paying a very dear price for the&s;e marks of approbation, &s;ince the gouty humour, repelled by fomentations, &s;oon &s;eized upon the nobler parts; which being perhaps weakened by his extraordinary fatigue on that occa&s;ion, he was not able to make a long re&s;i&s;tance: But on the 28th of April, 1710, he paid the debt to nature; and by his death occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t undi&s;&s;embled mourn|ing among&s;t people of rank and fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>His behaviour as a man, and his abilities as a player, rai&s;ed his character, and procured him the e&s;teem of all worthy and good men; and &s;uch honours were paid his memory, as only his memory could de&s;erve.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of May, his corp&s;e was with much ceremony interred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, and the excellent author of the Tatler, has given &s;uch an account of the &s;olemnity of it, as will outla&s;t the Abbey it&s;elf. And it is no &s;mall mor|tification to us, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with our propo&s;ed bounds, to tran&s;cribe the whole: It is writ with a noble &s;pirit; there is in it an air of &s;olemnity and grandeur; the thoughts ri&s;e natu|rally from one another; they fill the mind with an awful dread, and con&s;ecrate Mr. Betterton to im|mortality, with the warmth of friend&s;hip, heightened by admiration.</P>
<P>As to the character of this great man in his profe&s;|&s;ion, the reader need but reflect on Mr. Colley Cib|ber's account here in&s;erted, who was well qualified
<PB N="170" REF="173">
to judge, and who, in his Hi&s;tory of the Stage, has drawn the mo&s;t &s;triking pictures that ever were ex|hibited; even the famous lord Clarendon, who&s;e great excellence is characteri&s;ing, is not more hap|py in that particular, than the Laureat; no one can read his portraits of the players, without ima|gining he &s;ees the very actors before his eyes, their air, their attitudes, their ge&s;ticulations.</P>
<P>Mr. Betterton was a man of great &s;tudy and application; and, with re&s;pect to the &s;ubjects that employed his attention, he was as much a ma&s;ter of them as any man. He was an excellent critic, more e&s;pecially on Shake&s;pear, and Fletcher. Mr. Rowe, who was a good judge, and al&s;o &s;tudied the &s;ame authors with deep attention, gives this te&s;timony in his favour, and celebrates, in the warme&s;t manner, Betterton's critical abilities. His knowledge of Shake&s;pear's merit, gave him &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o perfect an e&s;teem for him, that he made a pilgrimage into Stafford&s;hire to vi&s;it his tomb, and to collect whatever particulars tradition might have pre&s;erved in rela|tion to his hi&s;tory; and the&s;e he freely communi|cated to the &s;ame friend, who candidly acknow|ledges, that the Memoirs of Shake&s;pear's Life he publi&s;hed, were the produce of that journey, and freely be&s;towed upon him by the collector. Mr. Booth, who knew him only in his decline, fre|quently made mention of him, and &s;aid, he never &s;aw him either off, or on the &s;tage, with|out learning &s;omething from him; he frequently ob&s;erved, that Mr. Betterton was no actor, but he put on his part with his clothes, and was the very man he undertook to be, 'till the play was over, and nothing more. So exact was he in following nature, that the look of &s;urprize he a&s;&s;umed in the character of Hamlet &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed Booth (when he fir&s;t per&s;onated the Gho&s;t) as to di&s;able him for &s;ome moments from going on. He was &s;o com|municative, that in the mo&s;t capital parts, he would
<PB N="171" REF="174">
enter into the grounds of his action, and explain, the principles of his art. He was an admirable ma&s;ter of the action of the &s;tage, con&s;idered as in|dependent of &s;entiment; and knew perfectly the connection, and bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;cenes, &s;o as to attract, pre&s;erve, and &s;atisfy the attention of an audience: An art extremely nece&s;&s;ary to an actor, and very difficult to be attained.</P>
<P>What demon&s;trated his thorough &s;kill in dramatic entertainments, was, his own performance, which was &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h a high reputation, independ|ent of his other merit. As he had the happine&s;s to pa&s;s through life without reproach, a felicity few at|tain, &s;o he was equally happy in the choice of a wife, with whom he &s;pent his days in dome&s;tic quiet, though they were of very different tempers; he was naturally gay and chearful, &s;he of a me|lancholy re&s;erved di&s;po&s;ition. She was &s;o &s;trongly affected by his death, which was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;udden, that &s;he ran di&s;tracted, tho' &s;he appeared rather a prudent and con&s;tant, than a fond and pa&s;&s;ionate wife: She was a great ornament to the &s;tage, and her death, which happened &s;oon after, was a public lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The Laureat, in his Apology, thus characteri&s;es her: <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'She was, &s;ays he, though far advanced in years, &s;o great a mi&s;tre&s;s of nature, that even Mrs. Barry, who acted Lady Macbeth after her, could not in that part, with all her &s;uperior &s;trength, and melody of voice, throw out tho&s;e quick and carele&s;s &s;trokes of terror, from the di&s;order of a guilty mind, which the other gave us, with a facility in her manner that rendered them at once tremendous and delight&s;ul. Time could not impair her &s;kill, though it brought her per&s;on to decay: &s;he was to the la&s;t the admiration of all true judges of nature, and lovers of Shake&s;pear, in who&s;e plays &s;he chiefly excelled, and without a rival. When

&s;he quitted the &s;tage, &s;everal good actre&s;&s;es were the better for her in&s;truction. She was a woman of an unblemi&s;hed and &s;ober life, and had the honour to teach Queen Anne, when Prince&s;s, the part of Semandra in Mithridates, which &s;he acted at court in King Charles's time. After the death of Mr. Betterton, that Prince&s;s, when Queen, ordered her a pen&s;ion for life, but &s;he lived not to receive more than the fir&s;t half year of it.'</Q> Thus we have &s;een, that it is not at all impo&s;&s;ible for per&s;ons of real worth, to transfer a reputation acquired on the &s;tage, to the characters they po&s;&s;e&s;s in real life, and it often happens, as in the words of the poet,<Q><L>That &s;cenic virtue forms the ri&s;ing age,</L>
<L>And truth di&s;plays her radiance from the &s;tage.</L></Q></P>
<P>The following are Mr. Betterton's dramatic works;<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Woman made a Ju&s;tice; a Comedy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Unju&s;t Judge, or Appius and Virginia; a Tragedy, written originally by Mr. John Web&s;ter, an old poet, who lived in the reign of James I. It was altered only by Mr. Betterton, who was &s;o cautious, and re&s;erved upon this head, that it was by accident the fact was known, at lea&s;t with certainty.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Amorous Widow, or the Wanton Wife, a Play, written on the plan of Moliere's George Dandin. The Amorous Widow has an under-plot interwoven, to accommodate the piece to the pre|vailing Engli&s;h ta&s;te. Is was acted with great applau&s;e, but Mr. Betterton, during his life, could never be induced to publi&s;h it; &s;o that it came into the world as a po&s;thumous performance.
<PB N="173" REF="176">
The chief merit of this, and his other pieces, lies in the exact di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;cenes; their ju&s;t length, great propriety, and natural connexions; and of how great con&s;equence this is to the fate of either tragedy or comedy, may be learned from all Banks's plays, which, though they have nothing el&s;e to recommend them, yet never fail to move an audience, much more than &s;ome ju&s;tly e&s;teemed &s;uperior. Who ever &s;aw Banks's earl of E&s;&s;ex re|pre&s;ented without tears; how few be&s;tow them upon the Cato of Addi&s;on.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e pieces, Betterton wrote &s;everal occa|&s;ional Poems, tran&s;lations of Chaucer's Fables, and other little exerci&s;es. In a word, to &s;um up all that we have been &s;aying, with regard to the character of this extraordinary per&s;on, as he was the mo&s;t perfect model of dramatic action, &s;o was he the mo&s;t unblemi&s;hed pattern of private and &s;ocial qualities: Happy is it for that player who imitates him in the one, and &s;till more happy that man who copies him in the other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We acknowledge a mi&s;take, which we committed in the life of Marloe, concerning Betterton. It was there ob&s;erved that he formed him&s;elf upon Alleyn, the famous founder of Dulwich-Ho&s;pital, and copied his theatrical excellencies: which, upon a review of Betterton's life, we find could not po&s;&s;ibly happen as Alleyn was dead &s;everal years before Betterton was born: The ob&s;ervation &s;hould have been made of Hart.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>JOHN BANKS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was bred a lawyer, and was a member of the &s;ociety at New Inn. His genius led him to make &s;everal attempts in dramatic poetry, in which he had various &s;uc|ce&s;s; but even when he met with the greate&s;t en|couragement, he was very &s;en&s;ible of his error, in quitting the profitable practice of the law, to pur&s;ue the entertainments of the &s;tage; but he was fired with a thir&s;t of fame, which reconciled to his mind the many unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, to which the pre|carious &s;ucce&s;s of his plays, and the indigence of his profe&s;&s;ion naturally expo&s;ed him: Mr. Banks no doubt has gained one part of his de&s;ign by commencing poet, namely, that of being remem|bered after death, which Pope &s;omewhere calls the poor e&s;tate of wits: For this gentleman has here a place among&s;t the poets, while nine tenths of the lawyers of his time, now &s;leep with their fathers &s;ecure in oblivion, and of whom we can only &s;ay, they lived, and died.</P>
<P>Mr. Banks's genius was wholly turned for tra|gedy; his language is certainly unpoetical, and his numbers unharmonious; but he &s;eems not to have been ignorant of the dramatic art: For in all his plays he has very forcibly rouzed the pa&s;&s;ions, kept the &s;cene bu&s;y, and never &s;uffered his characters to langui&s;h.</P>
<P>In the year 1684 Mr. Banks offered a tragedy to the &s;tage called the I&s;land Queens, or the Death
<PB N="175" REF="178">
of Mary Queen of Scots, which, it &s;eems, was re|jected, whether from its want of merit, or motives of a political kind, we cannot now determine, but Mr. Banks thought proper then to publi&s;h it. In the year 1706, he obtained the favour of Queen Anne to command it to be acted at the Theatre-Royal, which was done with &s;ucce&s;s, for it is really a very moving tragedy. It has been often revived, and performed at the Theatres, with no incon&s;iderable applau&s;e.</P>
<P>His dramatic works are,<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Rival Kings, or the Loves of Oroon|dates and Statira, a Tragedy, acted at the The|atre-Royal 1677. This play is dedicated to the Lady Catherine Herbert, and is chiefly formed on the Romance of Ca&s;&s;andra.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The De&s;truction of Troy, a Tragedy, acted 1679. This play met with but indifferent &s;ucce&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Virtue Betrayed, or Anna Bullen, a Trage|dy, acted 1682. This play has been often acted with applau&s;e.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Earl of E&s;&s;ex, or the Unhappy Favou|rite, acted 1682, with the mo&s;t general applau&s;e. Mr. Dryden wrote the Prologue, and Epilogue. It will be naturally expected, that, having men|tioned the earl of E&s;&s;ex by Banks, we &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of a Tragedy which has appeared this year on the Theatre at Covent-Garden, of the &s;ame name. We cannot but acknowledge, that Mr. Jones has improved the &s;tory, and heightened the incident in the la&s;t act, which renders the whole more moving; after the &s;cene of parting between E&s;&s;ex, and Southampton, which is very affecting, Rutland's di&s;tre&s;s upon the melancholy occa&s;ion of parting from her hu&s;band, is melting to the la&s;t degree. It is in this &s;cene Mr. Barry excells all his cotemporaries in tragedy; he there &s;hews his power
<PB N="176" REF="179">
over our pa&s;&s;ions, and bids the heart bleed, in every accent of angui&s;h. After E&s;&s;ex is carried out to execution, Mr. Jones introduces the queen at the tower, which has a very happy effect, and her manner of behaving on that occa&s;ion, makes her appear more amiable than ever &s;he did in any play on the &s;ame &s;ubject. Mr. Jones in his lan|guage (in this piece) does not affect being very poeti|cal;&mdash;nor is his ver&s;ification always mellifluent, as in his other writings;&mdash;but it is well adapted for &s;peaking: The de&s;ign is well conducted, the &s;tory ri&s;es regularly, the bu&s;ine&s;s is not &s;u&s;pended, and the characters are well &s;u&s;tained.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The I&s;land Queens, a Tragedy, of which we have already given &s;ome account; the name of it was afterwards changed to the Albion Queens.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The Innocent U&s;urper, or the Death of La|dy Jane Gray, a Tragedy, printed 1694. It was prohibited the &s;tage, on account of &s;ome groundle&s;s in&s;inuations, that it reflected upon the government. This play, in Banks's own opinion, is inferior to none of his former. Mr. Rowe has written likewi&s;e a Tragedy on this &s;ubject, which is a &s;tock play at both hou&s;es; it is as much &s;u|perior to that of our author, as the genius of the former was greater than that of the latter.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Cyrus the Great, a Tragedy. This play was at fir&s;t rejected, but it afterwards got upon the &s;tage, and was acted with great &s;ucce&s;s; the plot is taken from Scudery's Romance of the Grand Cyrus.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>We cannot a&s;certain the year in which Banks died. He &s;eems to have been a man of parts; his characteri&s;tic fault as a writer, was aiming at the &s;ublime, which &s;eldom failed to degenerate in|to
<PB N="177" REF="180">
the bomba&s;t; fire he had, but no judgment to manage it; he was negligent of his poetry, nei|ther has he &s;ufficiently marked, and di&s;tingui&s;hed his characters; he was generally happy in the choice of his fables, and he has found a way of drawing tears, which many a &s;uperior poet has tried in vain.</P>

<HEAD>LADY CHUDLEIGH</HEAD>
<P>WAS born in the year 1656, and was daugh|ter of Richard Lee of Win&s;lade, in the county of Devon, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> She had an education in which literature &s;eemed but little regarded, being taught no other language than her native tongue; but her love of books, ince&s;&s;ant indu&s;try in the reading of them, and her great capacity to im|prove by them, enabled her to make a very con|&s;iderable figure in literature.</P>
<P>She was married to Sir George Chudleigh of A&s;hton in the county of Devon, Bart, by whom &s;he had i&s;&s;ue Eliza Maria, who died in the bloom of life, (much lamented by her mother, who poured out her griefs on that occa&s;ion, in a Poem entitled a Dialogue between Lucinda and Mari&s;&s;a) and George, who &s;ucceeded to the title and e&s;tate, Thomas, and others.</P>
<P>She was a lady of great virtue, as well as un|der&s;tanding, and &s;he made the latter of the&s;e sub&s;ervient to the promotion of the former, which was much improved by &s;tudy; but though &s;he was enamoured of the charms of poetry, yet &s;he de|dicated

&s;ome part of her time to the &s;everer &s;tu|dy of philo&s;ophy, as appears from her excellent e&s;&s;ays, which di&s;cover an uncommon degree of piety, and knowledge, and a noble contempt of tho&s;e vanitie which the unthinking part of her &s;ex &s;o much regard, and &s;o eagerly pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>The works which this lady produced, are,</P>
<P>The Ladies Defence, or the Bride-Woman's Coun&s;ellor an&s;wered, a Poem; in a Dialogue be|tween Sir John Brute, Sir William Loveall, Me|li&s;&s;a, and a Par&s;on.

<HEAD>THOMAS CREECH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was born near Sherborne in Dor&s;et&s;hire, and bred up at the free &s;chool in that town, under Mr. Carganven, a man of eminent character, to whom in gratitude he in&s;cribes one of the Idylliums of Theocritus, tran|&s;lated by him. His parents circum&s;tances not being &s;ufficient to be&s;tow a liberal education upon him, colonel Strangeways, who was him|&s;elf a man of ta&s;te and literature, took notice of the early capacity of Creech, and being wil|ling to indulge his violent propen&s;ity to learning, placed him at Wadham College in Oxford, in the 16th year of his age, anno 1675, being then put under the tuition of two of the fellows. In the year 1683 he was admitted ma&s;ter of arts, and &s;oon elected fellow of All-&s;oul's College; at which time he gave di&s;tingui&s;hed proofs of his cla&s;&s;ical learning, and philo&s;ophy, before tho&s;e who
<PB N="187" REF="190">
were appointed his examiners. The fir&s;t work which brought our author into reputation, was his tran&s;lation of Lucretius, which &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that Mr. Creech had a party formed for him, who ventured to prefer him to Mr. Dryden, in point of genius. Mr. Dryden him&s;elf highly com|mended his Lucretius, and in his preface to the &s;econd volume of Poetical Mi&s;cellanies thus cha|racteri&s;es it. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I now call to mind what I owe to the ingenious, and learned tran&s;lator of Lucre|tius. I have not here de&s;igned to rob him of any part of that commendation, which he has &s;o ju&s;tly acquired by the whole author, who&s;e frag|ments only fall to my portion. The ways of|our tran&s;lation are very different; he follows him more clo&s;ely than I have done, which be|came an interpreter to the whole poem. I take more liberty, becau&s;e it be&s;t &s;uited with my de|&s;ign, which was to make him as plea&s;ing as I could. He had been too voluminous, had he u&s;ed my method, in &s;o long a work; and I had certainly taken his, had I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to tran&s;late the whole. The preference then is ju&s;tly his; and I join with Mr. Evelyn in the con|fe&s;&s;ion of it, with this additional advantage to him, that his reputation is already e&s;tabli&s;hed in this poet; mine is to make its fortune in the world. If I have been any where ob&s;cure in following our common author; or if Lucretius him&s;elf is to be condemned, I refer my&s;elf to his excellent annotations, which I have often read, and always with &s;ome plea&s;ure.'</Q></P>
<P>Many poets of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, of tho&s;e times, addre&s;&s;ed Mr. Creech in commendatory ver&s;es, which are prefixed to the tran&s;lation of Lucretius: but this &s;udden blaze of reputation was &s;oon ob|&s;cured, by his failing in an arduous ta&s;k, which the &s;ucce&s;s of his Lucretius prompted him to attempt. This was a tran&s;lation of the works of Horace,
<PB N="188" REF="191">
an author more diver&s;ified, and con&s;equently more difficult than Lucretius. Some have in&s;inuated, that Mr. Dryden, jealous of his ri&s;ing fame, and willing to take advantage of his vanity, in order to &s;ink his reputation, &s;trenuou&s;ly urged him to this undertaking, in which he was morally certain Creech could not &s;ucceed. Horace is &s;o various, &s;o ex|qui&s;ite, and perfectly delightful, that he who culls flowers in a garden &s;o repleni&s;hed with nature's productions, mu&s;t be well acquainted with her form, and able to delineate her beauties. In this attempt Creech failed, and a &s;hade was thrown over his reputation, which continued to ob&s;cure it to the end of his life. It is from this circum&s;tance al|ledged, that Mr. Creech contracted a melancholy, and moro&s;ene&s;s of temper, which occa&s;ioned the di&s;|inclination of many towards him, and threw him into habits of reclu&s;ene&s;s, and di&s;content. To this &s;ome writers likewi&s;e impute the ra&s;h attempt on his own life, which he perpetrated at Oxford, in 1701. This act of &s;uicide could not be occa&s;ioned by want, for Mr. Jacob tells us, that ju&s;t before that accident, he had been pre&s;ented by the college to the living of Welling in Hertford&s;hire. Mr. Bar|nard in his Nouvelles de la Republiques de Lettres, a&s;&s;igns another cau&s;e be&s;ides the diminution of his fame, which might occa&s;ion this di&s;a&s;trous fate. Mr. Creech, though a melancholy man, was yet &s;ubject to the pa&s;&s;ion of love. It happened that he fixed his affections on a lady who had either previou&s;ly engaged hers, or who could not be&s;tow them upon him; this di&s;appointment, which was a wound to his pride, &s;o affected his mind, that, unable any longer to &s;upport a load of mi&s;ery, he hanged him&s;elf in his own chamber. Which ever of the&s;e cau&s;es induced him, the event was melancholy, and not a little heightened by his being a clergyman, in who&s;e heart religion &s;hould have taken deeper root, and maintained a more &s;a|lutary
<PB N="189" REF="192">
influence, than to &s;uffer him thus to &s;tain his laurels with his own blood.</P>
<P>Mr. Creech's works, be&s;ides his Lucretius alrea|dy mentioned, are chiefly the&s;e,<LIST>
<ITEM>The Second Elegy of Ovid's Fir&s;t Book of Ele|gies. The 6th, 7th, 8th, and 12th Elegies of Ovid's Second Book of Elegies. The 2d and 3d Eclogue of Virgil. The Story of Lucretia, from Ovid de Fa&s;tis. B. ii. The Odes, Satires, and Epi&s;tles of Horace already mentioned, dedicated to John Dryden, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> who is &s;aid to have held it in great contempt, which gave &s;uch a &s;hock to Mr. Creech's pride. The author in his preface to this tran&s;lation has informed us, that he had not an ear capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing one note in mu|&s;ic, which, were there no other, was a &s;ufficient objection again&s;t his attempting the mo&s;t mu&s;ical poet in any language.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The &s;ame year he publi&s;hed his Tran&s;lation of the Idylliums of Theocritus, with Rapin's Di&s;|cour&s;e on Pa&s;torals, as al&s;o the Life of Phelopidas, from the Latin of Cornelius Nepos.</ITEM>
<ITEM>In Dryden's Tran&s;lation of Juvenal and Per&s;ius, Mr. Creech did the 13th Satire of Juvenal, and &s;ubjoined Notes. He al&s;o tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h, the ver&s;es before Mr. Quintenay's Compleat Gar|diner. The Life of Solon, from the Greek of Plutarch. Laconic Apophthegms, or Remarkable Sayings of the Spartans, printed in the fir&s;t Vo|lume of Plutarch's Morals. A Di&s;cour&s;e concern|ing Socrates's Daemon. The two Fir&s;t Books of the Sympo&s;iacs.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The&s;e are the works of Mr. Creech: A man of &s;uch parts and learning, according to the accounts of all who have written of him, that, had he not by the la&s;t act of his life effaced the merit of his labours, he would have been an or|nament
<PB N="190" REF="193">
as weil to the clerical profe&s;&s;ion, as his country in general. He well under&s;tood the an|cients, had an unu&s;ual penetration in di&s;cover|ing their beauties, and it appears by his own tran&s;lation of Lucretius, how elegantly he could cloath them in an Engli&s;h attire. His judgment was &s;olid; he was perfectly acquainted with the rules of critici&s;m, and he had from nature an extraordinary genius. However, he certainly over|rated his importance, or at lea&s;t his friends deceiv|ed him, when they &s;et him up as a rival to Dryden; but if he was inferior to that great man in judgment, and genius, there were few of the &s;ame age to whom he needed yield the palm. Had he been content to be reckoned only the &s;e|cond, in&s;tead of the fir&s;t genius of the times, he might have lived happy, and died regreted and reverenced, but like Cae&s;ar of old, who would ra+ther be the lord of a little village, than the &s;econd man in Rome, his own ambition overwhelmed him.</P>
<P>We &s;hall pre&s;ent the reader with a few lines from the &s;econd Book of Lucretius, as a &s;pecimen of our author's ver&s;ification, by which it will be found how much he fell &s;hort of Dryden in point of har|mony, though he &s;eems to have been equal to any other poet, who preceded Dryden, in that par|ticular.<Q><L>'Tis plea&s;ant, when the &s;eas are rough, to &s;tand,</L>

<HEAD>ARTHUR MAYNWARING, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman di&s;tingui&s;hed both for poetry and politics, as well as the gay accom|pli&s;hments of life. He was born at lghtfield, in the year 1668, and educated at the grammar-&s;chool at Shrew&s;bury, where he remained four or five years; and at about &s;eventeen years of age, was removed to Chri&s;t's Church in Oxford, under the tuition of Mr. George Smalridge, afterwards bi&s;hop of Bri&s;tol. After he removed from Oxford, he went into Che&s;hire, where he lived &s;everal years with his uncle, Mr. Francis Cholmondley, a gen|tleman of great integrity and honour; but by a po|litical prejudice, very aver&s;e to the government of William the IIId, to whom he refu&s;ed to take the oaths, and in&s;tilled anti-revolution principles into his nephew<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oldmixon's Life of Maynwaring.</NOTE>, who embraced them warmly; and on his fir&s;t entry into life, reduced to practice what he held in &s;peculation. He wrote &s;everal pieces in favour of James the IId's party: among&s;t which was a Panegyric on that King. He wrote another intitled the King of Hearts, to ridicule lord Dela|mere's entry into London, at his fir&s;t coming to town after the revolution. This poem was &s;aid to be Dry|den's, who was charged with it by Mr. Ton&s;on; but
<PB N="194" REF="197">
he di&s;owned it, and told him it was written by an in|genious young gentleman, named Maynwaring, then about twenty-two years of age.</P>
<P>When our author was introduced to the acquaint|ance of the duke of Somer&s;et, and the earls of Dor&s;et, and Burlington, he began to entertain (&s;ays Old|mixon) very different notions of politics: Whether from the force of the arguments made u&s;e of by tho&s;e noblemen; or, from a de&s;ire of preferment, which he plainly &s;aw lay now upon the revolution intere&s;t, cannot be determined; but he e&s;pou&s;ed the Whig mini&s;try, as zealou&s;ly as he had formerly &s;truggled for the exiled monarch.</P>
<P>Our author &s;tudied the law till he was five or &s;ix and twenty years old, about which time his father died, and left him an e&s;tate of near eight-hundred pounds a year, but &s;o incumbred, that the intere&s;t money amounted to almo&s;t as much as the revenue. Upon the conclu&s;ion of the peace of Ry&s;wick, he went to Paris, where he became acquainted with Mon&s;ieur Boileau, who invited him to his country hou&s;e, entertained him very elegantly, and &s;poke much to him of the Engli&s;h poetry, but all by way of enquiry; for he affected to be as ignorant of the Engli&s;h Mu&s;e, as if our nation had been as bar|barous as the Laplanders.</P>
<P>A gentleman, a friend of Mr. Maynwaring, vi&s;it|ing him &s;ome time after, upon the death of Mr. Dryden, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Boileau, &s;aid that he was wonderfully plea&s;ed to &s;ee by the public papers, that the Engli&s;h nation had paid &s;o extraordinary honours to one of their poets, burying him at the public charge;'</Q> and then a&s;ked the gentleman who that poet was, with as much indifference as if he had never heard Dryden's name; which he could no more be unacquainted with, than our country was with his; for he often frequented lord Monta|gue's hou&s;e, when he was emba&s;&s;ador in France,
<PB N="195" REF="198">
and being al&s;o an intimate friend of Mon&s;ieur De la Fontaine, who had &s;pent &s;ome time in England, it was therefore impo&s;&s;ible he could be ignorant of the &s;ame of Dryden; but it is peculiar to that na|tion to hold all others in contempt. The French would as fain monopolize wit, as the wealth and power of Europe; but thanks to the arms and genius of Britain, they have attempted both the one and the other without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Boileau's pretending not to know Dryden, to u&s;e the words of Milton, <Q REND="inline">'argued him&s;elf unknown.'</Q> But perhaps a rea&s;on may be a&s;&s;igned, why the wits of France affected a contempt for Mr. Dryden, which is this. That poet, in many of his Prefaces and De|dications, has unan&s;werably &s;hewn, that the French writers are really deficient in point of genius; that the correctne&s;s for which they are remarkable, and that even pace which they maintain in all their dramatic compo&s;itions, is a proof that they are not capable of &s;ublime conceptions; that they never ri&s;e to any degree of elevation, and are in truth unin&s;pired by the mu&s;es:&mdash;Judgment they may have to plan and conduct their de&s;igns; but few French poets have ever found the way of writing to the heart. Have they attained the &s;ublime height of Shake|&s;pear, the tenderne&s;s of Otway, or the pomp of Rowe? and yet the&s;e are names which a French ver&s;ifier will pretend, with an air of contempt, ne|ver to have heard of.</P>
<P>The truth is, our poets have lately done the French too much honour, by tran&s;lating their pieces, and bringing them on the &s;tage; as if our own &s;tock was exhau&s;ted, and the Briti&s;h genius had failed: But it is &s;ome &s;atisfaction, that the&s;e attempts &s;eem now to be di&s;couraged; we have &s;een a late play of theirs (we call it a play, for it was neither a tragedy, nor a comedy) tran&s;lated by a languid poet of our own, received with the coolne&s;s it de|&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="199">
But to return to Mr. Maynwaring. Upon his arri|val in England, from France, he was made one of the commi&s;&s;ioners of the cu&s;toms, in which po&s;t he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his &s;kill and fidelity.

He died at St. Albans, November the 13th, 1712, having &s;ome time before made his will; in which he left Mrs. Oldfield, the celebrated actre&s;s, his executrix, by whom he had a &s;on, named Arthur Maynwaring. He divided his e&s;tate pretty equally between that child, Mrs. Oldfield, and his &s;i&s;ter. Mr. Oldmixon tells us, that Mr. Maynwaring loved this actre&s;s, for nine or ten years before his death, with the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion: It was in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to his in&s;tructions that &s;he became &s;o fini&s;hed a player; for he under&s;tood the action of the &s;tage as well as any man, and took great plea&s;ure to &s;ee her excell in it. He wrote &s;everal Prologues and Epilogues for her, and would always hear her rehear&s;e them in private, before &s;he &s;poke them on the &s;tage. His friends of both &s;exes quarrelled with him for his attachment to her, and &s;o much re|&s;ented it, that Mrs. Oldfield frequently remon&s;trated to him, that it was for his honour and intere&s;t to break off the intrigue: which frankne&s;s and friend|&s;hip of hers, did, as he often confe&s;&s;ed, but engage him the more firmly; and all his friends at la&s;t gave over importuning him to leave her, as &s;he gained more and more upon him.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. THOMAS BROWN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS humorous poet was the &s;on of a con&s;iderable Farmer of Shiffnall, in Shrop|&s;hire, and educated at Newport-&s;chool in that coun|ty, under the reverend and learned Dr. Edwards, a gentleman who had the honour to qualify many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction for the univer&s;ity. Under the tuition of this ma&s;ter, he attained a knowledge of the Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and Spani&s;h languages, and his exerci&s;es were generally &s;o well performed, that the Dr. was filled with admiration of his parts. From Newport &s;chool he removed to Chri&s;t's-Church College in Oxford, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf there for his ea&s;y attainments in literature; but &s;ome little irregularities of his life would not &s;uffer him to continue long at the univer&s;ity. It is probable he became &s;ick of that di&s;cipline, which they who &s;pend their life in the reclu&s;ene&s;s of a col|lege, are in &s;ome mea&s;ure obliged to &s;ubmit to. The father of Mr. Brown, who intended to have him educated to &s;ome profe&s;&s;ion, was not made ac|quainted with his de&s;ign of quitting the univer&s;ity, and having remitted him a &s;um of money, to be appropriated for the promotion of his &s;tudies, his &s;on thought proper to defeat his kind intentions.</P>
<P>With this money, our author plann'd a &s;cheme of going to London, which he &s;oon after executed, not very advantageou&s;ly.&mdash;<Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'My fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ays he, was to apply my&s;elf to tho&s;e few friends I had there, who conjecturing I had left the univer&s;ity, exclu&s;ive of my father's know|ledge, gave but &s;lender encouragement to a young
<PB N="205" REF="208">
beginner. However, no whit daunted (my fir&s;t re&s;olution &s;till &s;tanding by me) I launched forth into the world, committing my&s;elf to the mercy of fortune, and the uncertain temper of the town. I &s;oon acquired a new &s;ett of acquaintance; and began to have a reli&s;h of what I had only ta&s;ted before by hear&s;ay; and indeed, every thing &s;erved to convince me, I had changed for the better, except that my &s;lender &s;ub&s;i&s;tance began to wa&s;te extremely; and ruminating upon the difficulty of obtaining a &s;upply, I was then laid under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of thinking what cour&s;e to &s;teer. I knew how ju&s;tly I had incurred the di&s;plea&s;ure of an indulgent father, and how far I had put my&s;elf from retrieving his favour. Amid&s;t this &s;erous contemplation! I re&s;olved to go through &s;titch with my enterprize, let what will come on't: However, that I might u&s;e di&s;cretion, to palliate an unfore&s;een event, I determined 'twere better to tru&s;t to the flexibility of a father's temper, than to lay too great a &s;tre&s;s upon the humanity of for|tune, who would let a man of morals &s;tarve if he depended on her favours. Therefore, without more ado (having taken my &s;orrowful leave of my la&s;t guinea, and reduced Carolus Secundus, from a whole number, to decimal fractions) I di&s;patched a letter into the country, full of excu&s;e, and penitence, baited with all the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive elo|quence imaginable. In the mean time, I was no le&s;s &s;edulous to find out &s;ome employment, that might &s;uit with my genius, and with my depen|dancies at home, render my life ea&s;y.'</Q></P>
<P>Whether his father was touched by the epi&s;tle which our author in con&s;equence of this re&s;olution wrote to him, we cannot a&s;certain, as there is no mention made of it. Soon after this, we find him &s;chool ma&s;ter of King&s;ton upon Thames, and happy for him, had he continued in that more certain em|ployment,
<PB N="206" REF="209">
and not have &s;o &s;oon exchanged it for beggary and reputation. Mr. Brown, impatient of a reclu&s;e life, quitted the &s;chool, and came again to London; and as he found his old com|panions more delighted with his wit, than ready to relieve his nece&s;&s;ities, he had recour&s;e to &s;cribbling for bread, which he performed with various &s;ucce&s;s. Dr. Drake, who has written a defence of our au|thor's character, prefixed to his works, informs us, that the fir&s;t piece which brought him into reputa|tion, was an account of the conver&s;ion of Mr. Bays, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ialogue, which met with a reception &s;uitable to the wit, &s;pirit, and learning of it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ut though this rai&s;ed his fame, yet it added very little to his profit: For, though it made his company exceed|ingly covet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and might have recommended him to the great, as well as to the ingenious, yet he was of a temper not to chu&s;e his acquaintance by intere&s;t, and &s;lighted &s;uch an opportunity of recommending him&s;elf to the powerful and opulent, as, if wi&s;ely improved, might have procured him dignities and preferments. The &s;tile of this dialogue, was like that of his ordinary conver&s;ation, lively and faceti|ous. It di&s;covered no &s;mall erudition, but managed with a great deal of humour, in a burle&s;que way; which make both the rea&s;oning and the exten&s;ive reading, which are abundantly &s;hewn in it, ex|tremely &s;urprizing and agreeable. The &s;ame man|ner and humour runs through all his writings, whether Dialogues, Letters, or Poems.</P>
<P>The only con&s;iderable objection, which the critics have made to his works is, that they want delicacy. But in an&s;wer to this, it may be affirmed, that there is as much refinement in his works, as the nature of humorous &s;atire, which is the chief beauty of his compo&s;itions, will admit; for, as &s;atire requires &s;trong ideas, the language will &s;ometimes be le&s;s poli&s;hed. But the delicacy &s;o
<PB N="207" REF="210">
much demanded, by &s;oftening the colours weakens the drawing. Mr. Brown has been charged with inequality in his writings: which is in&s;eparable from human<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty.</P>
<P>Our author's letters, though written carele&s;ly to private friends, bear the true &s;tamp and image of a genius. The variety of his learning may be &s;een in the Lacedaemonian Mercury, where abundance of critical que&s;tions of great nicety, are an&s;wered with much &s;olidity and judgment, as well as wit, and humour. But that de&s;ign expo&s;ing him too much to the &s;cruples of the grave and re&s;erved, as well as to the cen&s;ure, and curio&s;ity of the impertinent, he &s;oon di&s;continued it. Be&s;ides, as this was a periodi|cal work, he who was totally without &s;teadine&s;s, was very ill qualified for &s;uch an undertaking. When the pre&s;s called upon him for immediate &s;upply, he was often found debauching him&s;elf at a tavern, and by exce&s;&s;ive drinking unable to perform his engagements with the public, by which no doubt the work con&s;iderably &s;uffered.</P>
<P>But there is yet another rea&s;on why Mr. Brown has been charged with inequality in his writings, viz. that mo&s;t of the anonymous pieces which hap|pened to plea&s;e the town, were fathered upon him. This, though in reality an injury to him, is yet a proof of the univer&s;ality of his reputation, when whatever plea&s;ed from an unknown hand was a&s;cribed to him; but by the&s;e means he was reputed the writer of many things unworthy of him. In poetry he was not the author of any long piece, for he was quite unambitious of reputation of that kind. They are generally Odes, Satires, and Epi|grams, and are certainly not the be&s;t part of his works. His Tran&s;lations in Pro&s;e are many, and of various kinds. His &s;tile is &s;trong and ma&s;culine; and if he was not &s;o nice in the choice of his authors, as might be expected from a man of his ta&s;te, he
<PB N="208" REF="211">
mu&s;t be excu&s;ed; for he performed his tran&s;lations as a ta&s;k, pre&s;cribed him by the Book&s;ellers, from whom he derived his chief &s;upport. It was the misfortune of our author to appear on the &s;tage of the world, when fears, and jealou&s;ies had &s;oured the tempers of men, and politics, and polemics, had almo&s;t driven mirth and good nature out of the nation: &s;o that the carele&s;s gay humour, and negligent chearful wit, which in former days of tranquility, would have recommended him to the conver&s;ation of princes, was, in a gloomy period, lo&s;t upon a people incapable of reli&s;hing genuine humour.</P>
<P>An anonymous author who has given the world &s;ome account of Mr. Brown, ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that it was not his immorality that hindered him from climbing to the top of poetry, and preferment; but that he had a particular way of &s;inning to him&s;elf. To &s;peak in plain Engli&s;h (&s;ays he) Tom Brown had le&s;s the &s;pirit of a gentleman than the re&s;t of the Wits, and more of a Scholar, Tom thoughts him&s;elf as happy with a retailer of damnation in an ob&s;cure hole; as another to have gone to the devil with all the &s;plendour of a fine equipage. 'Twas not the brightne&s;s of Cae|lia's eyes, nor her gaudy trappings that attract|ed his heart. Cupid might keep his darts to him&s;elf; Tom always carried his fire about him. If &s;he had but a mouth, two eyes, and a no&s;e, he never enquired after the regularity of her dre&s;s, or features. He always brought a good &s;tomach with him, and u&s;ed but little ceremony in the preface. As of his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;o he was very negligent in the choice of his compani|ons, who were &s;ometimes mean and de&s;picable, a circum&s;tance which never fails to ruin a man's reputation. He was of a lazy temper, and the Book&s;ellers who gave him credit enough as to his capacity, had no confidence to put in his
<PB N="209" REF="212">
diligence.'</Q> The &s;ame gentleman informs us, that though Tom Brown was a good-natured man, yet he had one pernicious quality, which eternally procured him enemies, and that was, rather to lo&s;e his friend, than his joke.</P>
<P>One of his lampoons had almo&s;t co&s;t him a proce&s;&s;ion at the cart's tail; nor did he either &s;pare friend or foe, if the megrim of abu&s;e once &s;eized him. He had a particular genius for &s;candal, and dealt it out liberally when he could find occa&s;ion. He is famed for being the author of a Libel, fix|ed one Sunday morning on the doors of We&s;tmin|&s;ter-abbey, and many others, again&s;t the clergy and quality. As for religion, Brown never profe&s;&s;ed any, and u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he under&s;tood the world better than to have the imputation of righteou&s;|ne&s;s laid to his charge: and the world, to be even with him, really thought him an Athei&s;t. But though Brown never made any profe&s;&s;ions of reli|gion, yet it proceeded more from affectation than conviction. When he came upon his death-bed, he expre&s;&s;ed remor&s;e for his pa&s;t life, and di&s;co|vered at that period, &s;entiments which he had never before &s;uffered to enter his mind. This penitential behaviour, in the opinion of &s;ome, was the occa&s;ion why all his brethren neglected him, and did not be&s;tow on his memory one elegiac &s;ong, nor any of the rites of ver&s;e. We find no encomiums upon him, but what appeared in a Grub&s;treet Journal, which, however, are much &s;u|perior to what was u&s;ually to be found there.<Q><L>&mdash;A mournful mu&s;e from Albion &s;wains pro|duce,</L>

Towards the latter end of our author's life, we are informed by Mr. Jacob, that he was in favour with the earl of Dor&s;et, who invited him to din|ner on a Chri&s;tmas-day, with Mr. Dryden, and &s;ome other gentlemen, celebrated for ingenuity, (according to his lord&s;hip's u&s;ual cu&s;tom) when Mr. Brown, to his agreeable &s;urprize, found a Bank Note of 50 l. under his plate, and Mr. Dryden at the &s;ame time was pre&s;ented with another of 100 l. Acts of munificence of this kind were very com|mon with that generous &s;pirited nobleman.</P>
<P>Mr. Brown died in the year 1704, and was interred in the Cloy&s;ter of We&s;tmin&s;ter-abbey, near the re|mains of Mrs. Behn, with whom he was in|timate in his life-time.

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Bear it with no little concern to find my&s;elf &s;o &s;oon forgot among ye; I have paid as con&s;tant attendance to po&s;t-hours, in expectation to hear from ye, as a hungry Iri&s;h Man (at twelve) to a three-penny ordinary, or a decayed beau for nice eating to a roa&s;ting-cook's. No amorous-keeping fool, bani&s;hed from his Chloris in town, to his country &s;olitude, has waited with greater impati|ence for a kind epi&s;tle from her, than I for one from you. I have &s;earched all private packets, and examined every &s;tragling gho&s;t that came from your parts, without being able to get the lea&s;t in|telligence of your affairs. This is the third &s;ince my arrival in the&s;e gloomy regions, and I can give my&s;elf no rea&s;on why I have received none in an|&s;wer, unle&s;s the packet-boat has been taken by the French, or that &s;o little time has quite excluded me from your memories. In my fir&s;t I gave you an account of my journey hither, and my recep|tion among the ingenious in the&s;e gloomy regions.</P>
<P>I arrived on the Banks of Acheron, and found Charon &s;cooping his wherry, who &s;eeing me ap|proach him, bid me &s;it down a little, for he had been hard worked lately, and could not go with a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;enger: I was willing enough to embrace the propo&s;al, being much fatigued and weary. Having fini&s;hed what he was about, he ca&s;t his rueful a&s;pect up to the clouds, and demon&s;trating from thence (as I &s;uppo&s;e) it was near dinner-time, he took from out a locker or cupboard in the &s;tern of his pinnace, &s;ome provender pinned

He m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ttered &s;omething to him&s;elf, which might be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ce as far as I know; but if it were, 'twas as &s;hort as that at an Aucti|on-dinner, nor did he devour what was before him with le&s;s application than I have &s;een &s;ome there. For my part, I could not but contemplate on his &s;haggy locks, his wither'd &s;un-burnt coun|tenance, together with the mightine&s;s and &s;anctity of his beard; but above all, his brawny chopt knuckles employed my attention: In &s;hort, hav|ing &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">fied the cormorant in his guts, he had time to ask me what country-man I was? to which I &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively an&s;wered, an Engli&s;h-man: O, &s;ays he, tho&s;e Engli&s;h-men are merry rogues, and love mi&s;chief; I have &s;ometimes a diverting &s;tory from thence: What news have you brought with you? truly I told his highne&s;s I came away a little di&s;&s;atisfied, and had not made any remarks on the world for &s;ome time before my death; and for news I had not lei&s;ure to bring any thing of moment. But ere we had talked much more, we &s;aw two other pa&s;&s;engers approach us, who, by their often turning to one another, and their lay|ing down arguments with their hands, &s;eemed to be in warm debate together; which was as we conjectured; for when they drew nearer to us, they proved to be a termagant High-Flyer, and a puritanical Scripturian, a fiery Scotchman: Oc|ca&s;ional Conformity was their &s;ubject; for I heard the Scot tell him 'twas all popery, downright popery, and that the inqui&s;ition in Spain was chri&s;tianity to it, by retarding the &s;ons of grace from partaking of the gifts of the Lord; he &s;aid it was the bui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ding of Babel, and they were con|fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nded in the works of their hands by the confu|&s;ion

<P>Thou the &s;on of grace, &s;ays the other, thou art a &s;on of Satan, and ha&s;t preached up iniqui|ty; ye are the evil tares, and the land can never pro&s;per 'till ye are rooted out from among the good corn.</P>
<P>Thou art an inventer of lies, &s;aid the di&s;ciple of John Calvin, and the truth is not in thee; ye are bloody minded wretches, and your &s;ury is the on|ly &s;ign of your religion, as the &s;teeple is to the church; your organs are the prophane tinkling of the cimbals of Satan, that tickle the ears with vanity.</P>
<P>Thus the di&s;pute la&s;ted till they came to us, and getting into the boat, they jo&s;tled for pre-emi|nence, which might have proved a &s;harp conflict, had not the old fellow took up a &s;tretcher and parted them. After which we pa&s;&s;ed peaceably over to the other &s;ide: being landed, the Scot and I took our way together, and left the furious churchman to vent his &s;pleen by him&s;elf. We had not travelled long before we came to a po|pulous village, where, from the various multitude, our eyes encountered at a di&s;tance, we might ea|&s;ily conjecture that &s;omething more than ordinary had gathered them together in that manner; it re|&s;embled (as near as I can de&s;cribe it) that famous place called Sherrick-fair, or a Stafford&s;hire-Wake. While we were applying our admiration that way, we arrived at a &s;mall hut erected for that pur|po&s;e, where Nero the tyrant, like a blind fidler, was &s;urrounded by a confu&s;ed tribe of all &s;orts and &s;exes, like another Orpheus among the bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The various remarks I made (&s;ome dancing, &s;ome prancing; &s;ome clapping, &s;ome knapping; &s;ome drinking, &s;ome winking; &s;ome ki&s;&s;ing, &s;ome pi&s;&s;ing; &s;ome reeling, &s;ome &s;tealing) urged my curio&s;ity to enquire for what it was po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e

But the&s;e things that I took to be diverting, &s;o elevated the &s;pleen of my Puritan companion, that he began loudly to exclaim agnin&s;t tho&s;e prophane exerci&s;es: he &s;aid, they were impure, and lifted up the mind to lewd|ne&s;s; that tho&s;e that followed them, were the &s;ons of Belial. and wore the mark of the bea&s;t in their foreheads. I endeavoured to pacify the &s;anc|tified brother, by putting h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m in mind where we were, and that his ra&s;hne&s;s might draw us into danger, being in a &s;trange place; but all was in vain, I but &s;tirred up his fury more; for, turning his rebukes upon me, he told me, I was my&s;elf one of the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">cked, and did rejoice in my heart at the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ds of darkne&s;s: no, &s;ays he, I will not be pacified, I will roar aloud to drown their in|cantations; yea, I will &s;et out a throat even as the bea&s;t that belloweth! &s;o that perceiving the mob gather about him, I thought it prudence to &s;teal off, and leave him to the fury of tho&s;e, who&s;e di&s;|plea&s;ure he was about to incur.</P>
<P>I had not gone far, but I'&s;pied two brawney champions at a rubbers of cuffs, which by the dexterity of their heads, hands, and heels, I judged could be no other than Engli&s;hmen: nor were my &s;entiments groundle&s;s, for pre&s;ently I heard the mob cry out, O! rare Jo!

<P>But mo&s;t of all I was obliged to admire my friend Millington, who, by his powerful knack of eloquence, to the wonder of the whole company, &s;old Cave's Lives of the Fathers to Solomon the Magnificent, and the Scotch Directory to the Prie&s;ts of the Sun; nay, he &s;old Archbi&s;hop Laud's Life to Hugh Peters, Hob's Leviathan to Pope Boniface, and pop'd Bunyan's Works upon Bellarmine for a piece of unrevealed Divinity.

<HEAD>The Revd. Mr. JOHN POMFRET.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman's works are held in very great e&s;teem by the common readers of poe|try; it is thought as unfa&s;hionable among&s;t peo|ple of inferior life, not to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the po|ems of Pomfret, as among&s;t per&s;ons of ta&s;te not to have the works of Pope in their libraries. The &s;ubjects upon which Pomfret wrote were po|pular, his ver&s;ification is far from being unmu&s;i|cal, and as there is little force of thinking in his writings, they are level to the capacities of tho&s;e who admire them.</P>
<P>Our author was &s;on of the rev. Mr. Pomfret, rector of Luton in Bedford&s;hire, and he him&s;elf was preferred to the living of Malden in the &s;ame coun|ty. He was liberally educated at an eminent grammar &s;chool in the country, from whence he was &s;ent to the univer&s;ity of Cambridge, but to what college is not certain. There he wrote mo&s;t of his poetical pieces, took the degree of ma&s;ter of arts, and very early accompli&s;hed him|&s;elf in mo&s;t kinds of polite literature. A gentle|man who writes under the name of Philalethes, and who was an intimate friend of Pomfret's, has cleared his reputation from the charge of fanati|ci&s;m, which &s;ome of his malicious enemies brought again&s;t him. It was &s;hortly after his leaving the univer&s;ity, that he was preferred to the living of Malden abovementioned, and was, &s;ays that gen|tleman,
<PB N="219" REF="222">
&s;o far from being tinctured with fanati|ci&s;m, that I have often heard him expre&s;s his ab|horrence of the de&s;tructive tenets maintained by that people, both again&s;t our religious and civil rights. This imputation it &s;eems was ca&s;t on him by there having been one of his &s;ur-name, though not any way related to him, a di&s;&s;enting teacher, and who publi&s;hed &s;ome rhimes upon &s;piritual &s;ub|jects, as he called them, and which &s;ufficiently proved him an enthu&s;ia&s;t.</P>
<P>About the year 1703 Mr. Pomfret came up to London, for in&s;titution and induction, into a very con&s;iderable living, but was retarded for &s;ome time by a di&s;gu&s;t taken by dr. Henry Compton, then bi&s;hop of London, at the&s;e four lines, in the clo&s;e of his poem entitled The Choice.<Q><L>And as I near approach'd the verge of life,</L>
<L>Some kind relation (for I'd have no wife)</L>
<L>Should take upon him all my worldly care,</L>
<L>While I did for a better &s;tate prepare.</L></Q></P>
<P>The parenthe&s;is in the&s;e ver&s;es was &s;o malici|ou&s;ly repre&s;ented to the bi&s;hop, that his lord&s;hip was given to under&s;tand, it could bear no other con&s;truction than that Mr. Pomfret preferred a mi|&s;tre&s;s before a wife; though the words may as well admit of another meaning, and import no more, than the preference of a &s;ingle life to marriage; unle&s;s the gentlemen in orders will a&s;&s;ert, that an unmarried Clergyman cannot live without a mi&s;tre&s;s. But the bi&s;hop was &s;oon convinced that this a&s;per|&s;ion again&s;t him, was no more than an effort of malice, as Mr. Pomfret at that time was really married. The oppo&s;ition which his enemies made to him, had, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, its effect; for by the ob&s;tructions he met with, he was obliged to &s;tay longer in London than he intended, and as the Small-pox then raged in the metropolis, he &s;ickened of
<PB N="220" REF="223">
them, and died in London in the 36th year of his age.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned friend of Mr. Pomfret, has likewi&s;e &s;hewn the ungenerous treatment he met with in regard to his poetical compo&s;itions, in a book entitled Poems by the Earl of Ro&s;com|mon, and Mr. Duke, printed 1717, in the pre|face to which, the publi&s;her has peremptorily in&s;erted the following paragraph. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In this col|lection, &s;ays he, of my lord Ro&s;common's poems, care has been taken to in&s;ert all I po&s;&s;ibly could procure, that are truly genuine, there having been &s;everal things publi&s;hed under his name, which were written by others, the au|thors of which I could &s;et down if it were ma|terial. 'Now, &s;ays the gentleman, this arrogant editor would have been more ju&s;t, both to the publ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">c, and to the earl of Ro&s;common's memory, in telling us what things had been publi&s;hed un|der his lord&s;hip's name by others, than by con|cealing the authors of any &s;uch gro&s;s impo&s;iti|ons. In&s;tead of which, he is &s;o much a &s;tran|ger to impartiality, that he has been guilty of the very crime he exclaims again&s;t; for he has not only attributed the pro&s;pect of death to the earl of Ro&s;common, which was wrote by Mr. Pom&s;ret, after the decea&s;e of that lord; but likewi&s;e another piece entitled the Prayer of Jeremy Paraphra&s;ed, prophetically repre&s;enting the pa&s;&s;ionate grief of the Jewi&s;h people, for the lo&s;s of their town, and &s;anctuary, written by Mr. Southcot, a gentleman who publi&s;hed it in the year 1717, &s;o that it is to be hoped, in a future edition of the earl of Ro&s;common's, and Mr. Duke's poems, the &s;ame care will be taken to do the&s;e gentlemen ju&s;tice, as to prevent any other per&s;on from hereafter injuring the memory of his lord&s;hip.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pomiret publi&s;hed his poems in the year 1699, to which he has prefixed a very mode&s;t and
<PB N="221" REF="224">
&s;en&s;ible preface, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'I am not &s;o fond of fame, &s;ays he, as to de&s;ire it from the injudicious many; nor as &s;o morti&s;ied a temper as not to wi&s;h it from the di&s;cerning few.

Kirk, who was that Prince's general again&s;t the duke of Monmouth, was &s;ollicited by a beautiful lady in behalf of her hu&s;band, who then lay under &s;entence of death. The inhuman general con&s;ented to grant his fair petitioner her reque&s;t; but at no le&s;s a price than that of her innocence. The lady doat|ed on her hu&s;band, and maintained a hard &s;trug|gle between virtue, and affection, the latter of which at la&s;t prevailed, and &s;he yielded to his guilty em|braces. The next morning Kirk, with unparal|leled brutality, de&s;ired the lady to look out at the window of his bedchamber, when &s;he was &s;truck with the horrid &s;ight of her hu&s;band upon a &s;caffold, ready to receive the blow of the executioner; and before &s;he could reach the place where he was, in order to take a la&s;t embrace, her hu&s;band was no more.
<P>How far the lady may be ju&s;tified in this con|duct, is not our bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;cu&s;s: if it is called by the name of guilt, none ever had more pre&s;|&s;ing motives; and if &s;uch a crime could admit of an excu&s;e, it mu&s;t be upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion.</P></ITEM>

<ITEM>4. Upon the Divine Attributes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. A Pro&s;pect of Death.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Upon the General Conflagration, and the en&s;u|ing Judgment. There were two pieces of our au|thor's, publi&s;hed after his death by his friend Phi|lalethes; the fir&s;t of the&s;e entitled Rea&s;on, was wrote by him in the year 1700, when the debates concerning the doctrine of the Trinity were carried on with &s;o much heat by the Clergy one again&s;t another, that the royal authority was interpo&s;ed in order to put an end to a controver&s;y, which could never be &s;ettled, and which was pernicious in its con&s;equences. This is a &s;evere &s;atire, upon one of the parties engaged in that di&s;pute, but his not in&s;erting it among&s;t his other poems when he collected them into a volume, was, on ac|count of his having received very particular fa|vours, from &s;ome of the per&s;ons therein men|tioned. The other is entitled Dies Novi&s;&s;ima, or the La&s;t Epiphany, a Pindaric Ode on Chri&s;t's &s;econd Appearance to judge the World. In this piece the poet expre&s;&s;es much heart-felt piety: It is animated, if not with a poetical, at lea&s;t with &s;o devout a warmth, that as the Guardian has ob&s;erv|ed of Divine Poetry, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'We &s;hall find a kind of re|fuge in our plea&s;ure, and our diver&s;ion will be|come our &s;afety.'</Q></ITEM>

<P>This is all the account we are favoured with of the life and writings of Mr. Pomfret: A man not de&s;titute either of erudition or genius, of un|exceptionable morals, though expo&s;ed to the ma|lice of antagoni&s;ts. As he was a prudent man, and educated to a profe&s;&s;ion, he was not &s;ubject to

<HEAD>Dr. WILLIAM KING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS ingenious gentleman, was &s;on of Ezekiel King, of London. He received the rudiments of his education in We&s;tmin|&s;ter-&s;chool, under Dr. Bu&s;hy, and was removed from thence to Chri&s;t's-Church in Oxford, in Michaelmas term, 1681, when at the age of eigh|teen. He &s;tudied the civil law, and practi&s;ed it at Doctor's-Commons, with very great reputation; but the natural gaiety of his temper, and the love of company, betrayed him into tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which were incompatible with his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our author, by the reputation of his abilities obtained a patron in the earl of Pembroke, who upon his being appointed lord Lieutenant of Ireland, pre&s;s'd him to go over to that kingdom.</P>
<P>Upon Dr. King's arrival in Ireland, his excel|lency appointed him judge advocate, &s;ole commi&s;|&s;ioner of the prizes, and record keeper. There, he was well received, and countenanced by per&s;ons of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, and could he have changed his di&s;po&s;ition with the climate, had then an opportunity of making his fortune; but &s;o far was he from improving this occa&s;ion to the purpo&s;es of his intere&s;t, that he returned back to England, with no other trea&s;ure, than a few merry Poems, and humorous E&s;&s;ays. He was naturally of a cour|teous behaviour, and very obliging: His conver&s;a|tion was chearful, and his wit plea&s;ant and enter|taining. But at length he chiefly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on his fellow&s;hip in Chri&s;t's Church College: Before this
<PB N="229" REF="232">
time, he had publi&s;hed his mo&s;t ingenious Poem, called the Art of Cookery, in imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry, with &s;ome Letters to Dr. Li&s;ter and others; occa&s;ioned principally by the title of a book, publi&s;hed by the Dr. being the works of Apicius Coelius, concerning the &s;oups and &s;auces of the ancients, with an extract of the greate&s;t curi|o&s;ities contained in that book. Among&s;t his Letters, is one upon the Denti Scalps, or Tooth-picks of the Antients: Another contains an imitation of Horace: Epi&s;t. 5. Book I. being his invitation of Torquatus to &s;upper. And a third, contains re|marks on lord Grim&s;ton's play, called the Lawyer's Fortune; or Love in a Hollow-Tree.</P>
<P>At his lei&s;ure hours he wrote likewi&s;e, The Art of Love, an imitation of Ovid, De Arte Amandi. To which he prefixed an account of Ovid. In the latter part of his life, about the year 1711, he pub|li&s;hed an Hi&s;torical Account of the Heathen Gods and Heroes, for the u&s;e of We&s;tmin&s;ter, and other &s;chools; for the better and more ea&s;y under&s;tanding of the Cla&s;&s;ics. Be&s;ides the&s;e performances, we likewi&s;e find three numbers of a project, entitled, the Tran&s;actioner, or, U&s;eful Tran&s;actions: Con|taining a great number of &s;mall pieces, which it would be tedious here to enumerate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The de&s;ign of this work, was to ridicule Sir Hans Sloan's writings, in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions of the Royal-Society; of which Dr. Sloan was &s;ecretary. This work, of Dr. King's, which is now become very &s;carce, is one of the &s;evere&s;t and merrie&s;t Satires that ever was written in Pro&s;e.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We have already ob&s;erved, that our author while in Ireland, neglected the be&s;t opportunity of en|crea&s;ing his fortune; and the circum&s;tance which occa&s;ioned it we find to be this: He had contracted an intimacy which &s;oon grew into friend&s;hip, with judge Upton, a man of the &s;ame temper with him&s;elf, who delighted in retirement and poetical amu&s;ement. He had a country villa
<PB N="230" REF="233">
called Mountown, near Dublin, where he and Dr. King u&s;ed to retire, and &s;pend mo&s;t of their time without any regard to their public offices; and by the&s;e means neglecting to pay court to the lord lieutenant, they fell under his di&s;plea&s;ure. The&s;e two poetical companions, indulged no other thoughts but tho&s;e of living and dying in their rural retreat. Upon this occa&s;ion, Dr. King wrote a Pa&s;toral Poem, called Mully of Mountown: Mully was the name of a Red-Cow which gave him milk, whom he made the chief &s;ubject of his Poem; which at that time the critics would have impo&s;ed upon the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d as a political allegory, tho' this was a manner of writing, with which the Dr. was totally unac|quainted.</P>
<P>When Dr. King, after his return from Ireland, had retired to live upon his fellow&s;hip at Oxford, he was &s;ollicited by the earl of Angle&s;ey to come to town, and undertake a cau&s;e of his, then before the Hou&s;e of Lords, (in relation to &s;ome cruelties he was accu&s;ed of u&s;ing to his lady) back'd by the violent pro&s;ecution of his mother-in-law, the coun|te&s;s of Dorche&s;ter. Upon this occa&s;ion the Doctor &s;hook off the indolence of his nature, and &s;o &s;trenu|ou&s;ly engaged in the cau&s;e of his patron, that he gained the reputation of an able lawyer as well as a poet. He naturally hated bu&s;ine&s;s, e&s;pecially that of an advocate; but when appointed as a delegate, made a very di&s;cerning and able judge, yet never could bear the fatigue of wrangling. His chief plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ted in trifles, and he was never happier, than when hid from the world. Few people plea&s;ed him in conver&s;ation, and it was a proof of his liking them, if his behaviour was tolerably agreeable. He was a great di&s;&s;embler of his natural temper, which was &s;ullen, moro&s;e, and peevi&s;h, where he dur&s;t &s;hew it; but he was of a timorous di&s;po&s;ition, and the lea&s;t &s;light or neglect offered to him, would throw him into a melancholy de&s;pondency. He
<PB N="231" REF="234">
was apt to &s;ay a great many ill-natur'd things, but was never known to do one: He was made up of tenderne&s;s, pity, and compa&s;&s;ion; and of &s;o femi|nine a di&s;po&s;ition, that tears would fall from his eyes upon the &s;malle&s;t occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>As his education had been &s;trict, &s;o he was always of a religious di&s;po&s;ition, and would not enter upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, till he had performed his devotion, and read &s;everal portions of &s;cripture out of the P&s;alms, the Prophets, and the New-Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>It appears from his loo&s;e papers, which he calls Adver&s;aria, that he had been &s;uch an a&s;&s;iduous &s;tu|dent, that before he was eight-years in the univer&s;ity, he had read over and made reflections on twenty|two thou&s;and books and manu&s;cripts; a few of which we &s;hall give as &s;pecimen, in order to let the rea|der into the humour and ta&s;te of our author.<Q><P>'Diogenes Laertius, Book I.&mdash;Thales, being a&s;ked how a man might mo&s;t ea&s;ily brook misfor|tunes? an&s;wered, if he &s;aw his enemies in a wor&s;e condition.

That no &s;eal-graver &s;hould keep the &s;eal of a ring that was &s;old: That, if any man put out the eye of him who had but one, he &s;hould lo&s;e both his own: That, where a man never planted, it &s;hould be death to take away: That, it &s;hould be death for a ma|gi&s;trate to be taken in drink.'</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="235">
'Solon's letters at the end of his life, in Laertius, give us a truer Idea of the man, than all he has written before, and are indeed very fine: Solon's to Crae&s;us are very genteel; and Pitaccus's on the other &s;ide, are rude and philo&s;ophical: However, both &s;hew Crae&s;us to have been a very good man.

<P>The above notes are &s;ufficient to &s;hew that he read the ancients with attention, and knew how to &s;elect the mo&s;t curious pa&s;&s;ages, and mo&s;t de&s;erving the reader's ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>About the year 1711 the Dr. publi&s;hed a piece called the Briti&s;h Palladium, or a welcome of lord Bolingbroke from France. Soon after this, Dr. Swift, Dr. Friend, Mr. Prior, with &s;ome others of lord Bolingbroke's adherents, paid a vi&s;it to Dr. King, and brought along with them, the key of the Gazetteer's office, together with another key for the u&s;e of the paper office. The day following
<PB N="233" REF="236">
this friendly vi&s;it, the Dr. entered upon his new po&s;t; and two or three days after waited on his benefactor lord Bolingbrooke, then &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</P>
<P>The author of the Doctor's life, publi&s;hed by Curl, has related an in&s;tance of inhumanity in alder|man Barber, towards Dr. King. This magi&s;trate was then printer of the Gazette, and was &s;o cruel as to oblige the Dr. to &s;it up till three or four o'clock in the morning, upon tho&s;e days the Gazette was publi&s;hed, to correct the errors of the pre&s;s; which was not the bu&s;ine&s;s of the author, but a corrector, who is kept for that purpo&s;e in every printing-office of any con&s;equence. This &s;lavery the Dr. was not able to bear, and therefore quitted the office. The alderman's &s;everity was the more unwarrantable, as the Dr. had been very kind in obliging him, by writing Examiners, and &s;ome other papers, gratis, which were of advantage to him as a printer. Tho&s;e writings at that juncture made him known to the mini&s;try, who afterwards employed him in a &s;tate paper called the Gazettee.</P>
<P>About Mid&s;ummer 1712 the Dr. quitted his em|ploy, and retired to a gentleman's hou&s;e on Lambeth &s;ide the water; where he had diverted him&s;elf a &s;ummer or two before: Here he enjoyed his lov'd tranquility, with a friend, a bottle, and his books; he frequently vi&s;ited lord Clarendon, at Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, as long as he was able. It was the autumn &s;ea&s;on, and the Dr. began in&s;en&s;ibly to droop: He &s;hut him&s;elf up entirely from his neare&s;t friends, and would not &s;o much as &s;ee lord Clarendon; who hearing of his weak condition, ordered his &s;i&s;ter to go to Lambeth, and fetch him from thence to a lodging he had provided for him, in the Strand, over again&s;t Somer&s;et-hou&s;e where next day about noon he expired, with all the pati|ence, and re&s;ignation of a philo&s;opher, and the true devotion of a chri&s;tian; but would not be per&s;uaded

<HEAD>THOMAS SPRAT (Bi&s;hop of RO|CHESTER)</HEAD>
<P>WAS de&s;cended from a very worthy, though ob&s;cure family, being the &s;on of a private country mini&s;ter; but his great merit rai&s;ed him to that eminent &s;tation in the church, wherein he long pre&s;ided, and was de&s;ervedly accounted one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his time. The Oxford antiquary informs us, that on the 16th of January 1654, he was entered in Wadham-College, where he pur&s;ued his &s;tudies with the clo&s;e&s;t application, and di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his prudent and courte|ous behaviour.</P>
<P>On the 3d of July 1669, Mr. Sprat took his ma&s;ter of arts degree, and the &s;ame day, commenced doctor in divinity. He had not long been in holy orders, till he was introduced at court, and by a happy power in conver&s;ation, &s;o attracted the re|gard of Charles the IId. that he was con&s;idered as a man &s;tanding fair for preferment. In 1683, broke out the Rye-hou&s;e Plot, a relation of the particulars of which, Charles the IId. commanded Dr. Sprat to draw up. This the Dr. in a letter to lord Dor&s;et, informs us, he did with great unwillingne&s;s, and would have been impelled by no other con&s;idera|tion, that that of a royal command. The rea&s;on he executed the&s;e orders with &s;o much reluctance, was, becau&s;e many of the mo&s;t popular men in the nation were either concerned them&s;elves, or had &s;ome relations engaged, &s;o that an account of a plot thus

&s;upported, mu&s;t expo&s;e he writer to partial or popular re&s;entments.</P>
<P>He reque&s;ted the king, that he might be permit|ted to &s;pare &s;ome names, and to repre&s;ent the be|haviour of others in as candid a light as po&s;&s;ible, in which reque&s;t his maje&s;ty indulged him; but not|with&s;tanding all the candour he ob&s;erved, and the mo&s;t di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate repre&s;entation of facts, yet his compo&s;ing this relation, was brought again&s;t him as a crime, for which an oppo&s;ite party endeavoured, and had almo&s;t effected his ruin. This work, tho' fini&s;hed in the year 1683 was not publi&s;hed till 1685, when it came into the world, under the im|mediate direction of king James the IId. It was no doubt in con&s;equence of this court &s;ervice, that he was made dean of We&s;tmin&s;ter, Anno 1683; and bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ter the year following. Another &s;tep he took in the &s;hort reign of king James, like|wi&s;e expo&s;ed him to the re&s;entment of that power which took place at the revolution, which was his &s;itting in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion. By this he drew upon him&s;elf almo&s;t an univer&s;al cen&s;ure, which he acknowledges to be ju&s;t; as appears by a letter he wrote upon that occa&s;ion to the earl of Dor&s;et, in the year 1689; which thus begins.<LETTER>

His crime in this particular was &s;omewhat alle|viated, by his renouncing the commi&s;&s;ion, when he perceived the illegal practices they were going to put in execution. His offences were &s;treunou&s;ly urged again&s;t him, and had not the earl of Dor&s;et warmly e&s;pou&s;ed his intere&s;t, he had probably been &s;tript of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments. His lord|&s;hip charged the ill-conduct of both the&s;e affairs upon king James and his mini&s;try; and thereby brought the bi&s;hop's opponents to a perfect reconci|liation with him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this accommodation, &s;uch was the inquietude of the times, that his lord&s;hip had not long enjoyed this tranquility, before there was hatched a mo&s;t villainous contrivance; not only to take away his life, but, the lives of archbi&s;hop Sancroft, lord Marlborough, and &s;everal other per&s;ons of honour and di&s;tinction; by forging an in&s;trument under their hands, &s;etting forth, that they had an intent to re&s;tore king James, and to &s;eize upon the per&s;on of the prince&s;s of Orange, dead or alive; to &s;urprize the tower, to rai&s;e a mighty army; and to bring the city of London into &s;ubjection. This black con&s;piracy to murther &s;o many innocent per&s;ons, was by the providence of God &s;oon detected; and his lord&s;hip drew up, and publi&s;hed an account of it, under this title, A Rela|tion of the Wicked Contrivance of Stephen Black|head, and Robert Young, again&s;t the Lives of &s;e|veral Per&s;ons, by forging an A&s;&s;ociation under their Hands.

The &s;econd, being an Account of the two Authors of the Forgery; printed in quarto, in the year 1692.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip was honourably acquitted; and he ever after looked upon this e&s;cape, as one of the mo&s;t remarkable ble&s;&s;ings of his life. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'In &s;uch

<P>Hitherto, we have con&s;idered Dr. Sprat in his epi&s;copal, and public character; in which if he fell into &s;ome errors, he has a right to our candour, as they &s;eem rather to have proceeded from mi&s;infor|mation, and exce&s;s of good-nature, than any male|volent, or &s;elfi&s;h principle: We &s;hall now take a view of him as an author.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t appearance in that &s;phere, was in the year 1659, when in concert with Mr. Waller, and Mr. Dryden, he printed a Pindarique Ode, to the Memory of the mo&s;t renowned Prince, Oliver, Lord Protector, &amp;c. printed in quarto, which he dedica|ted to the reverend Mr. Wilkin's, then warden of Wadham-College; by who&s;e approbation and re|que&s;t, it was made public, as the author de&s;igned it only for a private amu&s;ement. This was an unfa|vourable circum&s;tance for our author, as it more particularly &s;hews the ficklene&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition in &s;tate-matters, and gave him le&s;s credit with tho&s;e parties he afterwards e&s;pou&s;ed.</P>
<P>His next production in poetry, was an Ode on the Plague of Athens; which happened in the &s;econd year of the Peloppone&s;ian war, fir&s;t de&s;cribed by Thucydides, afterwards by Lucretius: This Mr. Sprat dedicated to his worthy and learned friend, Dr. Walter Pope. The performance &s;tood the te&s;t of the &s;evere&s;t critics; and in the opinion of the be&s;t judges, the manner of his great original was judi|ciou&s;ly imitated. Soon after this, he proceeded to give the public a &s;pecimen of his abilities in another kind, and &s;ucceeded with the greate&s;t applau&s;e; which was his Ob&s;ervations on Mon&s;ieur de Serbiere's

<P>Mr. Sprat in the beginning of his letter acquaints the Dr. with the motives of his engaging with Mon&s;ieur Serbiere, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Having now (&s;ays he) under my hands, the hi&s;tory of the Royal-Society, it will be in vain for me to try to repre&s;ent its de&s;ign to be advantageous to the glory of England, if my countrymen &s;hall know, that one who calls him&s;elf a member of that &s;ociety, has e&s;caped un|an&s;wered in the public di&s;graces, which he has ca&s;t on our whole nation.'</Q>&mdash;In this performance Mr. Sprat has given an undeniable proof, that the &s;trength and &s;olidity of an Engli&s;h pen, is infinitely &s;uperior to the gallant air of a French author, who is &s;prightly without propriety, and po&s;itive without truth.</P>

Soon after this, Mr. Sprat lo&s;t his amiable and much e&s;teemed friend Mr. Abraham Cowley, who by his will recommended to the care of his reverend friend, the revi&s;ing of all his works that were printed, and the collecting of tho&s;e papers which he had de&s;igned for the pre&s;s. This tru&s;t Mr. Sprat faithfully di&s;|charged, and to the new edition of Mr. Cowley's Works, he prefixed an account of his life and writ|ings, addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Martin Clifford.

<P>This life of Cowley, by Dr. Sprat has been e&s;teemed one of the mo&s;t elegant compo&s;itions in our language; there are &s;everal extracts from it in our account of the life of that amiable Poet.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the mo&s;t material performances of Dr. Sprat: a man, who was early introduced into an elevated &s;tation in life, which he held not without enemies to his dying moments. Villiers duke of Buckingham was his fir&s;t patron, who notwith&s;tand|ing his ficklene&s;s, and incon&s;i&s;tent levity, never for|&s;ook him; a circum&s;tance which has induced many to believe, that that nobleman owed much to the refinement of our author; and that his Rehear&s;al had never been &s;o excellent, nor &s;o pungent a &s;atire, had it not fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed under Dr. Sprat's peru&s;al.</P>
<P>This learned prelate died of an apoplexy, May the 20th, 1713, at his epi&s;copal &s;eat in Bromly in Kent, in the 79th year of his age; and was interred in the Abbey-Church of We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>CHARLES MONTAGUE (Earl of HALLIFAX)</HEAD>
<P>WAS born the 16th of April 1661, and re|ceived the rudiments of his education at We&s;tmin&s;ter-&s;chool: From thence he was removed to Trinity-College in Cambridge, where by the bright|ne&s;s of his parts he was early di&s;tingui&s;hed; and coming to town &s;oon after the death of king Charles the IId. he contracted an intimacy with the earl of Dor&s;et, Sir Charles Sedley, and other wits of the age.

In 1694 he was made chancellor and under trea&s;urer of the exchequer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collins's Peerage. See Article Hallifax.</NOTE>. In the year 1695, when the nation was di&s;tre&s;s'd, by the ill-&s;tate of the current coin of this kingdom, he pro|jected the new coining of the &s;ilver money; and by his great prudence, and indefatigable indu&s;try brought it to bear.

<P>On the acce&s;&s;ion of queen Anne, he was con|cerned in vindicating the memory of king William, and on all occa&s;ions &s;hewed a di&s;intere&s;ted zeal in the &s;ervice of his country.

And further, to &s;trengthen the intere&s;t of the Whigs, which he thought was e&s;&s;entially connected with the pro|te&s;tant religion, his lord&s;hip propo&s;ed the bill for the naturalization of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Hanover, and for the better &s;ecurity of the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the prote&s;tant line; which being pa&s;s'd into an act, her maje&s;ty made choice of him to carry the news to our late &s;overeign; and to inve&s;t his &s;on with the en&s;igns of the mo&s;t noble order of the Garter. On his arrival at Hanover, he was received with extraordina|ry marks of di&s;tinction, and honour.

<P>On her maje&s;ty's death, our author was one of the regency nominated by king George the 1&s;t. till his arrival; who was no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the crown, but he &s;hewed him di&s;tingui&s;ing marks of his favour, having &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly promoted his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the Briti&s;h throne. He had his maje&s;ty's leave to re&s;ign his po&s;t of auditor of the exchequer, to his nephew the honourable George Montague; and after being made fir&s;t lord commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury, and &s;worn of the privy-council, he was advanced to the dignity of earl of Hallifax, and

<HEAD>WILLIAM WYCHERLEY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS Gentleman was &s;on of Daniel Wycherley, of Cleve in Shrop&s;hire, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and was born (&s;ays Wood) in the year 1640.</P>
<P>When he was about fifteen years of age, he was &s;ent to France, in the we&s;tern parts of which he re&s;ided upon the banks of the Charante; where he was often admitted to the conver&s;ation of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed ladies of the court of France, parti|cularly madam de Montau&s;ieur, celebrated by mon&s;. Voiture in his letters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dennis's Letters, vol. i. p. 213.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A little before the re&s;toration of Charles the IId, he became a gentleman commoner of queen's col|lege in Oxford, and lived in the provo&s;t's lodgings; and was entered in the public library, under the title of philo&s;ophiae &s;tudio&s;us, in July 1660. He quitted the univer&s;ity without being matriculated, having, according to the Oxford antiquary, been re|conciled to the prote&s;tant religion, which he had renounced during his travels, probably by the per|&s;wa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">on of tho&s;e gay ladies, with whom he conver&s;ed in France. This circum&s;tance &s;hews how dangerous it is to engage in a debate with a female antago|ni&s;t, e&s;pecially, if that antagoni&s;t joins beauty with under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Mr. Wycherley afterwards entered him&s;elf in the Middle-Temple; but making his fir&s;t appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n town, in a reign when wit and gaiety were the fa|vourite
<PB N="249" REF="252">
di&s;tinctions, he relingui&s;hed the &s;tudy of the law, and engaged in pur&s;uits more agreeable to his own genius, and the gallant &s;pirit of the times.</P>
<P>Upon writing his fir&s;t Play, entitled Love in a Wood, or St. James's Park; and acted at the Theatre-royal, in 1672, he became acquainted with &s;everal of the mo&s;t celebrated wits, both of the court and town; and likewi&s;e with the duche&s;s of Cleveland. Mr. Dennis, in his Letters quoted above, has given a particular relation of the begin|ning of his acquaintance with this celebrated beauty of the times, which is &s;ingular enough.&mdash;One day Mr. Wycherley riding in his chariot through St. James's Park, he was met by the duche&s;s, who&s;e chariot jo&s;tled with his, upon which &s;he looked out of her chariot, and &s;poke very audibly, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"You Wycherley, you are a &s;on of a whore,"</Q> and then bur&s;t into a fit of laughter. Mr. Wycherley at fir&s;t was very much &s;urprized at this, but he &s;oon re|covered him&s;elf enough to recollect, that it was &s;poke in allu&s;ion to the latter end of a Song in his Love in a Wood;<Q><L>When parents are &s;laves,</L>
<L>Their brats cannot be any other;</L>
<L>Great wits, and great braves,</L>
<L>Have always a punk for their mother.</L></Q></P>
<P>During Mr. Wycherley's &s;urprize, the chariots drove different ways, they were &s;oon at a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance from each other; when Mr. Wycherley recollecting, ordered his coachman to drive back, and overtake the lady. As &s;oon as he got over a|gain&s;t her, he &s;aid to her, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Madam, you was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow a title upon me, which generally be|longs to the fortunate. Will your lady&s;hip be at the play to night? Well, &s;he replied, what if I &s;hould be there? Why then, an&s;wered he, I will be there to wait on your lady&s;hip, though I di&s;|appoint
<PB N="250" REF="253">
a fine woman, who has made me an a&s;|&s;ignation. So, &s;aid &s;he, you are &s;ure to di&s;appoint a woman who has favoured you, for one who has not. Yes, he replied, if &s;he who has not favour|ed me is the finer woman of the two: Put he who will be con&s;tant to your lady&s;hip, till he can find a finer woman, is &s;ure to die your captive."</Q></P>
<P>The duche&s;s of Cleveland, in con&s;equence of Mr. Wycher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ey's compliment, was that night, in the fir&s;t row of the king's box in Drury-Lane, and Mr. Wycherley in the pit under her, where he enter|tained her during the whole play; and this was the beginning of a corre&s;pondence between the&s;e two per&s;ons, which afterwards made a great noi&s;e in the town.</P>
<P>This accident, was the occa&s;ion of bringing Mr. Wycherley into favour with George duke of Buck|ingham, who was pa&s;&s;ionately in love with that lady, but was ill-treated by her, and who believed that Mr. Wycherley was his happy rival. The duke had long &s;ollicited her, without obtaining any favour: Whether the relation between them &s;hocked her, for &s;he was his cou&s;in-german; or, whether &s;he apprehended that an intrigue with a per&s;on of his rank and character, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in a &s;hort time come to the king's ears; whatever was the cau&s;e, &s;he refu&s;ed &s;o long to admit his vi&s;its, that at la&s;t indignation, rage, and di&s;dain took place of love; and he re&s;olved to ruin her. When he took this re&s;olution, he had her &s;o narrowly watched by his &s;pies, that he &s;oon di&s;covered tho&s;e whom he had rea&s;on to believe were his rivals; and after he knew them, he never failed to name them aloud, in order to expo&s;e the lady to all tho&s;e who vi&s;ited her; and among others, he never failed to mention Mr. Wycherley. As &s;oon as it came to the know|ledge of the latter, who had all his expectations from court, he apprehended the con&s;equences of
<PB N="251" REF="254">
&s;uch a report, if it &s;hould reach the King; and applied him&s;elf therefore to Wilmot earl of Roche&s;|ter, and Sir Charles Sedley, entreating them to remon&s;trate to the duke of Buckingham, the mi&s;|chief he was about to do to one who had not the honour to know him, and who had not offended him. Upon opening the matter to the duke, he cried out immediately, that he did not blame Wycherley, he only accu&s;ed his cou&s;in. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Ay, but they replied, by rendering him &s;u&s;pected of &s;uch an intrigue, you are about to ruin him; that is, your grace is about to ruin a man, who&s;e conver&s;ation you would be plea&s;ed with above all things.'</Q></P>
<P>Upon this occa&s;ion, they &s;aid &s;o much of the &s;hining qualities of Mr. Wycherley, and the charms of his conver&s;ation, that the duke, who was as much in love with wit, as he was with his cou&s;in, was impatient, till he was brought to &s;up with him, which was in two or three nights. After &s;upper, Mr. Wycherley, who was then in the height of his vigour, both in body and mind, thought him&s;elf o|bliged to exert his talents, and the duke was charmed to that degree, that he cried out with tran&s;port, and with an oath, <Q REND="inline">'My cou&s;in's in the right of it,'</Q> and from that very moment made a friend of a man he before thought his rival.</P>
<P>In the year 1673 a comedy of his called the Gentleman Dancing-Ma&s;ter, was acted at the duke's Theatre, and in 1678 his Plain Dealer was acted with general applau&s;e. In 1683 his Country Wife was performed at the &s;ame Theatre. The&s;e Plays rai&s;ed him &s;o high in the e&s;teem of the world, and &s;o recommended him to the favour of the duke of Buckingham, that as he was ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, and colonel of a regiment, he be&s;towed two places on Wycherley: As ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, he made him one of his equeries; and as colonel of a regi|ment,
<PB N="252" REF="255">
a captain lieutenant of his own company. King Charles likewi&s;e gave our author the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of favour, perhaps beyond what any &s;overeign prince had &s;hewn before to an author, who was only a private gentleman: Mr. Wycherley happened to be ill of a fever, at his lodgings in Bow-Street, Covent-Garden; during his &s;ick|ne&s;s, the king did him the honour of a vi&s;it; when finding his fever indeed abated, but his body ex|tremely weakened, and his &s;pirits mi&s;erably &s;hatter|ed, he commanded him to take a journey to the &s;outh of France, believing that nothing could con|tribute more to the re&s;toring his former &s;tate of health, than the gentle air of Montpelier, during the winter &s;ea&s;on: at the &s;ame time, the king a&s;&s;ur|ed him, that as &s;oon as he was able to undertake that journey, he would order five-hundred pounds to be paid him, to defray the expences of it.</P>
<P>Mr. Wycherley accordingly went to France, and returned to England the latter end of the &s;pring fol|lowing, with his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">alth entirely re&s;tored. The king received him with the utmo&s;t marks of e&s;teem, and &s;hortly after told him, he had a &s;on, whom he re|&s;olved &s;hould be educated like the &s;on of a king, and that he could make choice of no man &s;o proper to be his g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vernor as Mr. Wycherley; and, that for this &s;ervice, he &s;hould have fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">teen-hundred pounds a year allotted him; the King al&s;o added, that when the time came, that his office &s;hould cea&s;e, he would take care to make &s;uch a provi&s;ion for him, as &s;hould &s;et him above the malice of the world and fortune. The&s;e were golden pro&s;pects for Mr. Wycherley, but they were &s;oon by a cro&s;s accident da&s;hed to pieces.</P>
<P>Soon after this promi&s;e of his maje&s;ty's, Mr. Dennis tells us that Mr. Wycherley went down to Tunbridge, to take either the benefit of the waters, or the diver&s;ions of the place; when walking one day upon the wells-walk, with his friend Mr. Fair|beard
<PB N="253" REF="256">
of Grey's-Inn, ju&s;t as he came up to the book&s;eller's, the counte&s;s of Drogheda, a young widow, rich, noble and beautiful, came to the book&s;eller, and enquired for the Plain Dealer. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Madam, &s;ays Mr. Fairbeard, &s;ince you are for the Plain Dealer, there he is for you,'</Q> pu&s;hing Mr. Wycherley towards her. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'Yes, &s;ays Mr. Wycherley, this lady can bear plain dealing, for &s;he appears to be &s;o accompli&s;hed, that what would be a compliment to others, when &s;aid to her, would be plain dealing.&mdash;No truly Sir, &s;aid the lady, I am not without my faults more than the re&s;t of my &s;ex; and yet, notwith|&s;tanding all my faults, I love plain dealing, and never am more fond of it, then when it tells me of a fault:'</Q> Then madam, &s;ays Mr. Fairbeard, you and the plain dealer &s;eem de&s;igned by heaven for each other. In &s;hort, Mr. Wycherley acompa|nied her upon the walks, waited upon her home, vi&s;ited her daily at her lodgings whil&s;t &s;he &s;tayed at Tunbridge; and after &s;he went to London, at her lodgings in Hatton-Garden: where in a little time he obtained her con&s;ent to marry her. This he did by his father's command, without ac|quainting the king; for it was rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that the lady having a great independent e&s;tate, and noble and powerful relations, the acquainting the king with the intended match, would be the likelie&s;t way to prevent it. As &s;oon as the news was known at court, it was looked upon as an affront to the king, and a contempt of his maje&s;ty's orders: and Mr. Wycherley's conduct after mar|riage, made the re&s;entment fall heavier upon him: For being con&s;cious he had given offence, and &s;el|dom going near the court, his ab&s;ence was con|&s;trued into ingratitude.</P>
<P>The counte&s;s, though a &s;plendid wife, was not formed to make a hu&s;ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d happy; &s;he was in her nature extremely jealous, and indulged it to
<PB N="254" REF="257">
&s;uch a degree, that &s;he could not endure her hu&s;|band &s;hould be one moment out of her &s;ight. Their lodgings were in Bow-&s;treet, Covent-Gar|den, over again&s;t the Cock Tavern; whither if Mr. Wycherley at any time went, he was obliged to leave the windows open, that his lady might &s;ee there was no woman in the company.</P>
<P>This was the cau&s;e of Mr. Wycherley's di&s;grace with the King, who&s;e favour and affection he had be|fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a degree The counte&s;s &s;ettled all her e&s;tate upon him, but his title being di&s;puted after her death, the expence of the law, and other incumbrances, &s;o far reduced him, that he was not able to &s;atisfy the impatience of his creditors, who threw him at la&s;t into pri&s;on; &s;o that he, who but a few years before was flouri&s;hing in all the gaiety of life, flu&s;hed with pro&s;pects of court preferment, and happy in the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive reputation for wit and parts, was condemn|ed to &s;uffer all the rigours of want: for his father did not think proper to &s;upport him. In this &s;evere extremity, he fell upon an expedient, which, no doubt, was dictated by his di&s;tre&s;s, of applying to his Book&s;eller, who had got con&s;iderably by his Plain Dealer, in order to borrow 20 l. but he applied in vain; the Book&s;eller refu&s;ed to lend him a &s;hilling; and in that di&s;tre&s;s he langui&s;hed for &s;even years: nor was he relea&s;ed 'till one day King James go|ing to &s;ee his Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">n-Dealer performed, was &s;o charmed w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">th it, that he gave immediate orders for the payment of the author's debts, adding to that bounty a pen&s;ion of 200 l. per annum, while he con|tinued in England. But the generous intention of that Prince to him, had not the de&s;igned effect, pure|ly through his mode&s;ty; he being a&s;hamed to tell the earl of Mulgrave, whom the King had &s;ent to de|mand it, a full &s;tate of his debts. He laboured un|der the weight of the&s;e difficulties 'till his father
<PB N="255" REF="258">
died, and then the e&s;tate that de&s;cended to him, was left under very unea&s;y limitations, he being only a tenant for life, and not being allowed to rai&s;e money for the payment of his debts: yet, as he had a power to make a jointure, he married, almo&s;t at the eve of his days, a young gentlewo|man of 1500 l. fortune, part of which being ap|plied to the u&s;es he wanted it for, he died eleven days after the celebration of his nuptials in Decem|ber 1715, and was interred in the vault of Co|vent-Garden church.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the plays already mentioned, he publi&s;h|ed a volume of poems 1704, which met with no great &s;ucce&s;s; for, like Congreve, his &s;trength lay only in the drama, and, unle&s;s on the &s;tage, he was but a &s;econd rate poet. In 1728 his po&s;thu|mous works in pro&s;e and ver&s;e were publi&s;hed by Mr. Lewis Theobald at London in 8vo.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennis, in a few words, has &s;ummed up this gentleman's character; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'he was admired by the men for his parts, in wit and learning; and he was ad|mired by the women for tho&s;e parts of which they were more competent judges.'</Q> Mr. Wycher|ley was a man of great &s;prightline&s;s, and vivaci|ty of genius, he was &s;aid to have been hand&s;ome, formed for gallantry, and was certainly an idol with the ladies, a felicity which even his wit might not have procured, without exterior advantages.</P>
<P>As a poet and a dramati&s;t, I cannot better exhi|bit his character than in the words of George lord Lan&s;downe; he ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that the earl of Ro|che&s;ter, in imitation of one of Horace's epi&s;tles, thus mentions our author;'<Q><L>' Of all our modern wits none &s;eem to me,</L>

<L>' Shadwel's unfini&s;h'd works do yet impart</L>
<L>' Great proofs of nature's force; tho' none of art.</L>
<L><PB N="256" REF="259">
' But Wycherley earns hard whate'er he gains,</L>
<L>' He wants no judgment, and he &s;pares no pains.</L></Q> 'Lord Lan&s;downe is per&s;waded, that the earl fell into this part of the character (of a laborious writer) merely for the &s;ake of the ver&s;e; if ha&s;ty, &s;ays he, would have &s;tood as an epithet for Wycherley, and &s;low, for Shadwel, they would in all probability have been &s;o applied, but the ver&s;e would have been &s;poiled, and to that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit. Tho&s;e, who would form their judgments only upon Mr. Wycherley's writings, without any per&s;onal acquaintance with him, might indeed be apt to conclude, that &s;uch a di|ver&s;ity of images and characters, &s;uch &s;trict en|quiries into nature, &s;uch clo&s;e ob&s;ervations on the &s;everal humours, manners, and affections of all ranks and degrees of men, and, as it were, &s;o true and perfect a di&s;&s;ection of humankind, delivered with &s;o much pointed wit, and force of expre&s;&s;ion, could be no other than the work of extraordinary diligence, labour, and application; but in truth, we owe the plea&s;ure and advan|tage of having been &s;o well entertained, and in|&s;tructed by him, to his facility of doing it; if it had been a trouble to him to write, I am much mi&s;taken if he would not have &s;pared that trou|ble. What he has performed, would have been difficult for another; but a club, which a man of an ordinary &s;ize could not lift, was a walking &s;taff for Hercules. To judge by the &s;harpne&s;s, and &s;pirit of his &s;atires, you might be led into another mi&s;take, and imagine him an ill-natur'd man, but what my lord Roche&s;ter &s;aid of lord Dor&s;et, is applicable to him, the be&s;t good man with the wor&s;t natured mu&s;e. As pointed, and &s;evere as he is in his writings, in his temper he had all the &s;oftne&s;s of the tendere&s;t di&s;po&s;ition; gentle and inoffen&s;ive to every man in his par|ticular

character; he only attacks vice as a pub|lic enemy, compa&s;&s;ionating the wound he is un|der a nece&s;&s;ity to probe, or grieving, like a good natured conqueror, at the occa&s;ions which provoke him to make &s;uch havock. King Charles II. a nice di&s;cerner of men, and him&s;elf a man of wit, often cho&s;e him for a companion at his lei&s;ure hours, as Augu&s;tus did Horace, and had very advantageous views for him, but un|luckily an amorous inclination interfered; the lover got the better of the courtier, and ambi|tion fell a &s;acrifice to ove, the predominant pa&s;|&s;ion of the noble&s;t mind. Many object to his ver&s;ification; it is certain he is no ma&s;ter of num|bers, but a Diamond is not le&s;s a Diamond for not being poli&s;hed&punc;'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Pope, when very young, made his court to Mr. Wycherley, when very old; and the latter was &s;o well plea&s;ed with the former, and had &s;uch an opinion of his ri&s;ing genius, that he entered into an intimate corre&s;pondence with him, and &s;ubmitted his works to Mr. Pope's correction.

<HEAD>NAHUM TATE</HEAD>
<P>WAS born about the middle of the reign of Charles II. in the kingdom of Ireland, and there received his education. He was a man of learning, courteous, and candid, but was thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s no great genius, as being defi|cient in what is its fir&s;t characteri&s;tic, name|ly, invention.

<HEAD>Sir SAMUEL GARTH.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was de&s;cended from a good family in York&s;hire; after he had pa&s;&s;ed through his &s;chool education, he was removed to Peter-hou&s;e in Cambridge, where he is &s;aid to have continued till he was created Dr. of Phy&s;ic July 7, 1691<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Biog.

<P>In 1696 Dr. Garth zealou&s;ly promoted the erect|ing the Di&s;pen&s;ary, being an apartment in the college for the relief of the &s;ick poor, by giving them advice gratis, and di&s;pen&s;ing medicines to them at low rates. This work of charity having expo&s;ed him, and many other of the mo&s;t eminent Phy&s;icians to the envy and re&s;entment of &s;everal per&s;ons of the &s;ame faculty, as well as Apothe|caries, he ridiculed them with peculiar &s;pirit, and vivacity, in his poem called the Di&s;pen&s;ary in 6 Cantos; which, though it fir&s;t &s;tole into the world a little ha&s;tily, and incorrect, in the year 1669, yet bore in a few months three impre&s;&s;ions, and was afterwards printed &s;everal times, with a dedi|cation

to Anthony Henley, e&s;quire. This poem, gained our author great reputation; it is of the burle&s;que &s;pecies, and executed with a degree of humour, hardly equal'd, unle&s;s in the Rape of the Lock.</P>
<P>Our author's poetical character, joined with his &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, his agreeable conver&s;ation, and unaffected good nature, procured him va&s;t practice, introduced him to the acquaintance, and e&s;tabli&s;hed him in the e&s;teem of mo&s;t of the no|bility and gentry. Much about the &s;ame time he gave a di&s;tingui&s;hing in&s;tance of his profound knowledge in his profe&s;&s;ion, his perfect acquain|tance with antiquity, and correct ta&s;te in Roman eloquence by a Latin oration, pronounced before the Faculty in Warwick-La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e, September 17, 1697, to the great &s;atisfaction of the audience, and the rai&s;ing his own reputation, as the college re|gi&s;ter te&s;tifies. Pieces of this kind are often com|po&s;ed with peculiar attention to the phra&s;e, the &s;ound of the periods in &s;peaking, and their effect upon the ear; the&s;e advantages were by no means neglected in Dr. Garth's performance, but the &s;en|timents, the &s;pirit, and &s;tile appeared to &s;till great|er advantage in the reading; and the applau&s;e with which it was received by its hearers, was ecchoed by tho&s;e who peru&s;ed it; this in&s;tance is the more &s;ingular, as few have been di&s;tingui&s;hed both as ora|tors and poets.</P>
<P>Clcero, who was not heard by his cotempora|ries with greater applau&s;e, than his works are now read with admiration, attempted poetry without &s;ucce&s;s; reputation in that kind of writing the Roman orator much de&s;ired, but never could com|po&s;e a line to plea&s;e him&s;elf, or any of his friends.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="268">
Upon the death of Dryden in May 1701, by a ve|ry &s;trange accident his burial <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dryden's Life.</NOTE> came to depend on the piety of Dr. Garth, who cau&s;ed the body to be brought to the College of Phy&s;icians, propo&s;ed and encouraged by his generous example a &s;ub&s;crip|tion for defraying the expence of the funeral, and after pronouncing over the corp&s;e a &s;uitable oration, he attended the &s;olemnity to We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, where at la&s;t the remains of that great man were interred in Chaucer's grave. For this memorable act of tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity, tho&s;e who loved the per&s;on, or who honoured the parts of that ex|cellent poet, expre&s;&s;ed much gratitude to Dr. Garth. He was one of the mo&s;t eminent mem|bers of a famous &s;ociety called the Kit-Kat Club, which con&s;i&s;ted of above thirty noblemen and gen|tlemen, di&s;tingui&s;hed by their zealous affection to the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the Hou&s;e of Hanover<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of the Stewarts, vol. ii. p. 479.</NOTE>. October 3, 1702 he was elected one of the Cen|&s;ors of the College of Phy&s;icians. In re&s;pect to his political principles, he was open and warm, and which was &s;till more to be valued, he was &s;teady and &s;incere. In the time of lord Godol|phin's admini&s;tration, nobody was better received of his rank than Dr. Garth; and nobody &s;eemed to have a higher opinion of that mini&s;ter's integrity, and abilities in which he had, however, the &s;atis|faction of thinking with the public.</P>
<P>In 1710, when the Whig mini&s;try was di&s;carded, and his lord&s;hip had an opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing his own friends, from tho&s;e which were only the friends of his power, it could not fail of giving him &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure to find Dr. Garth early de|claring for him, and among&s;t the fir&s;t who be|&s;towed upon him the tribute of his mu&s;e, at a time when that nobleman's intere&s;t &s;unk: A &s;itua|tion

which would have &s;truck a flatterer dumb.

In order to form a judg|ment both of the Critici&s;m, and the Defence, it will be nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t of all to read the poem to which they refer, more e&s;pecially as it is very &s;hort, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written &s;uddenly, and, at lea&s;t, as much from the author's gratitude to his noble patron, as a de&s;ire of add|ing to his reputation.<Q><LG>

<P>The&s;e ver&s;es, however they may expre&s;s the gra|titude, and candour of the author, and may con|tain no more than truth of the per&s;onage to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed, yet, every reader of ta&s;te will perceive, that the ver&s;es are by no means equal to the re&s;t of Dr. Garth's poetical writings. Re|marks upon the&s;e ver&s;es were publi&s;hed in a Let|ter to the Examiner, September 7, 1710. The author ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'That there does not appear either poetry, grammar, or de&s;ign in the com|po&s;ition of this poem; the whole (&s;ays he) &s;eems to be, as the &s;ixth edition of the Di&s;pen&s;ary, happily expre&s;&s;es it, a &s;trong, unlaboured, impotence of thought. I freely examine it by the new te&s;t of good poetry, which the Dr. him&s;elf has e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. Plea&s;ing at fir&s;t &s;ight: Has this piece the lea&s;t title even to that? or if we compare it to the only pattern, as he thinks, of ju&s;t writing in this kind, Ovid; is there any thing in De Tri&s;ti|bus &s;o wild, &s;o childi&s;h, &s;o flat? what can the ingenious Dr. mean, or at what time could he write the&s;e ver&s;es? half of the poem is a pane|gyric on a Lord Trea&s;urer in being, and the re&s;t a compliment of condolance to an Earl that has lo&s;t the Staff. In thirty lines his patron is a ri|ver,

the primum mobile, a pilot, a victim, the &s;un, any thing and nothing. He be&s;tows in|crea&s;e, conceals his &s;ource, makes the machine move, teaches to &s;teer, expiates our offences, rai&s;es vapours, and looks larger as he &s;ets; nor is the choice of his expre&s;&s;ion le&s;s exqui&s;ite, than that of his &s;imilies.

The Dr. has a happy talent at in|vention, and has had the glory of enriching our language by his phra&s;es, as much as he has improved medicine by his bills.'</Q> The critic then proceeds to con&s;ider the poem more minutely, and to expo&s;e it by enumerating particulars. Mr Ad|di&s;on in a Whig Examiner publi&s;hed September 14, 1710, takes occa&s;ion to rally the fierce over|bearing &s;pirit of the Tory Examiner, which, he &s;ays, has a better title to the name of the execu|tioner. He then enters into the defence of the Dr's. poem, and ob&s;erves, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that the phra&s;e of pa&s;&s;ions being poized, and retrieving merit from depen|dence, cavi'led at by the critics, are beautiful and poetical; it is the &s;ame cavilling &s;pirit, &s;ays he, that finds fault with that expre&s;&s;ion of the Pomp of Peace, among Woes of War, as well as of Offering una&s;ked.'</Q> This general piece of raillery which he pa&s;&s;es on the Dr's. con&s;idering the trea&s;urer in &s;everal different views, is that which might fall upon any poem in Waller, or any other writer who has diver&s;ity of thoughts and allu&s;ions, and though it may appear a plea&s;ant ridicule to an ignorant reader, is wholly ground|le&s;s and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on's An&s;wer is, however, upon the whole, rather a palliation, than a defence. All the &s;kill of that writer could never make that
<PB N="269" REF="272">
poetical, or a fine panegyric, which is in its own nature removed from the very appearance of poetry; but friend&s;hip, good nature, or a coincidence of party, will &s;ometimes engage the greate&s;t men to combat in defence of trifles, and even again&s;t their own judgment, as Dryden finely expre&s;&s;es it in his Addre&s;s to Congreve,<Q>" Vindicate a friend."</Q></P>
<P>In 1711 Dr. Garth wrote a dedication for an in|tended edition of Lucretius, addre&s;&s;ed to his late Maje&s;ty, then Elector of Brun&s;wick, which has been admired as one of the pure&s;t compo&s;itions in the Latin tongue that our times have produced.</P>
<P>On the acce&s;&s;ion of that King to the throne, he had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him by his Maje&s;ty, with the duke of Marlbo|rough's &s;word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chronol. Diary for A. D. 1714-15.</NOTE>. He was likewi&s;e made Phy|&s;ician in ordinary to the King, and Phy&s;ician General to the army. As his known &s;ervices pro|cured him a great intere&s;t with tho&s;e in power, &s;o his humanity and good nature inclined him to make u&s;e of that intere&s;t, rather for the &s;upport, and encouragement of men of letters who had me|rit, than for the advancement of his private for|tune; his views in that re&s;pect having been always very moderate. He lived with the great in that degree of e&s;teem and independency, and with all that freedom which became a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperi|or genius, and the mo&s;t &s;hining and valuable ta|lents. His poem entitled Claremont, addre&s;&s;ed to the duke of Newca&s;tle, printed in the 6th vo|lume of Dryden's Mi&s;cellanies, met with great ap|probation.

<P>Dr. Garth is &s;aid to have been a man of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive benevolence; that his hand and heart went always together: A circum&s;tance more valuable than all the lu&s;tre which genius can confer. We can|not however, &s;peak of his works with &s;o much warmth, as the author ju&s;t quoted &s;eems to indulge. His works will &s;carce make a moderate volume, and though they contain many things excellent, judicious, and humorous, yet they will not ju&s;tify the writer, who dwells upon them in the &s;ame rap|turous &s;train of admiration, with which we &s;peak of a Horace, a Milton, or a Pope. He had the happine&s;s of an early acquaintance with &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful, wi&s;e&s;t, and wittie&s;t men of the age in which he lived; he attached him&s;elf to a party,

which at la&s;t obtained the a&s;cendant, and he was equally &s;ucce&s;sful in his fortune as his friends: Per&s;ons in the&s;e circum&s;tances are &s;eldom prai&s;ed, or cen&s;ured with moderation.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een how warmly Addi&s;on e|&s;pou&s;ed the Dr's. writings, when they were at|tacked upon a principle of party, and there are many of the greate&s;t wits of his time who pay him compliments; among&s;t the re&s;t is lord Lan&s;|downe, who wrote &s;ome ver&s;es upon his illne&s;s; but as the lines do no great honour either to his lord&s;hip, or the Dr. we forbear to in&s;ert them.</P>
<P>The following pa&s;&s;age is taken from one of Pope's Letters, written upon the death of Dr. Garth, which, we dare &s;ay, will be more acceptable. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The be&s;t natured of men (&s;ays he) Sir Samuel Garth has left me in the true&s;t concern for his lo&s;s.

<P>Our author was cen&s;ured for his love of plea&s;ure, in which perhaps it would be ea&s;ier to excu&s;e than defend him; but upon the whole, his character appears to have been very amiable, particularly, that of his bearing a tide of pro&s;perity with &s;o much evenne&s;s of temper; and his univer&s;al benevolence, which &s;eems not to have been cramped with party principles; as appears from his piety towards the remains of Dryden.</P>

Mr. Rowe could trace his an|ce&s;tors in a direct line up to the times of the ho|ly war, in which one of them &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf, that at his return he had the arms given him, which the family has born ever &s;ince, that being in tho&s;e days all the reward of military virtue, or of blood &s;pilt in tho&s;e expeditions.</P>
<P>From that time downward to Mr. Rowe's father, the family betook them&s;elves to the frugal manage|ment of a private fortune, and the innocent plea|&s;ures of a country life. Having a hand&s;ome e&s;tate, they lived beyond the fear of want, or reach of envy. In all the changes of government, they
<PB N="273" REF="276">
are &s;aid to have ever leaned towards the &s;ide of public liberty, and in that retired &s;ituation of life, have beheld with grief and concern the many en|croachments that have been made in it from time to time.</P>
<P>Our author was born at Little Berkford in Bed|ford&s;hire, at the hou&s;e of Ja&s;per Edwards, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> his mother's father, in the year 1673<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Welwood's preface to Rowe's Lucan.</NOTE>. He began his education at a private grammar-&s;chool in Highgate; but the ta&s;te he there acquired of the cla&s;&s;ic authors, was improved, and fini&s;hed un|der the care of the famous Dr. Bu&s;by of We&s;t|min&s;ter &s;chool; where, about the age of 12 years, he was cho&s;en one of the King's &s;cholars. Be&s;ides his &s;kill in the Latin and Greek languages, he had made a tolerable proficiency in the Hebrew; but poetry was his early bent, and darling &s;tudy. He compo&s;ed, at different times, &s;everal copies of ver&s;es upon various &s;ubjects both in Greek and Latin, and &s;ome in Engli&s;h, which were much ad|mired, and the more &s;o, becau&s;e they were pro|duced with &s;o much facility, and &s;eemed to flow from his imagination, as fa&s;t as from his pen.</P>
<P>His father, who was a Serjeant at Law, de&s;ign|ing him for his own profe&s;&s;ion, took him from that &s;chool when he was about &s;ixteen years of age, and entered him a &s;tudent in the Middle Tem|ple, whereof him&s;elf was a member, that he might have him under his immediate care and in&s;tructi|on. Being capable of any part of knowledge, to which he thought proper to apply, he made very remarkable advances in the &s;tudy of the Law, and was not content to know it, as a collection of &s;tatutes, or cu&s;toms only, but as a &s;y&s;tem founded upon right rea&s;on, and calculated for the good of mankind. Being afterwards called to the bar, he promi&s;ed as fair to make a figure in that profe&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="274" REF="277">
as any of his cotemporaries, if the love of the Belles Lettres, and that of poetry in particular, had not &s;topped him in his career. To him there appeared more charms in Euripides, Sophocles, and Ae&s;chilus, than in all the records of an|tiquity, and when he came to di&s;cern the beau|ties of Shake&s;pear and Milton, his &s;oul was cap|tivated beyond recovery, and he began to think with contempt of all other excellences, when put in the ballance with the enchantments of poetry and genius. Mr. Rowe had the be&s;t opportunities of ri&s;ing to eminence in the Law, by means of the patronage of Sir George Treby, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, who was fond of him to a very great degree, and had it in his power to promote him; but being overcome by his propen&s;ion to poetry, and his fir&s;t tragedy, called the Ambitious Step-mother, meeting with univer&s;al applau&s;e, he laid a&s;ide all thoughts of the Law. The Ambitious Step mother was our author's fir&s;t attempt in the drama, written by him in the 25th year of his age, and dedi|cated to the earl of Jer&s;ey. <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'The purity of the language (&s;ays Mr. Welwood) the ju&s;tne&s;s of his characters, the noble elevation of the &s;entiments, were all of them admirably adapted to the plan of the play.'</Q></P>
<P>The Ambitious Step-mother, being the fir&s;t, is con|ducted with le&s;s judgment than any other of Rowe's tragedies; it has an infinite deal of fire in it, the bu|&s;ine&s;s is precipitate, and the characters active, and what is &s;omewhat remarkable, the author never after wrote a play with &s;o much elevation. Critics have complained of the &s;amene&s;s of his poetry; that he makes all his characters &s;peak equally elegant, and has not attended &s;ufficiently to the manners. This uniformity of ver&s;ification, in the opinion of &s;ome, has &s;poiled our modern tragedies, as poetry is made to &s;upply nature, and declamation cha|racters.
<PB N="275" REF="278">
Whether this ob&s;ervation is well found|ed, we &s;hall not at pre&s;ent examine, only remark, that if any poet has a right to be forgiven for this error, Mr. Rowe certainly has, as his cadence is the &s;weete&s;t in the world, his &s;entiments cha&s;te, and his language elegant. Our author wrote &s;everal other Tragedies, but that which he valued him&s;elf mo&s;t upon, &s;ays Welwood, was his Tamerlane; acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and dedicated to the marquis of Hartington.</P>
<P>In this play, continues Welwood, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'He aimed at a parallel between the late king William and Tamerlane, and al&s;o Bajazet, and a monarch who is &s;ince dead. That glorious ambition in Tamer|lane, to break the chains of en&s;laved nations, and &s;et mankind free from the encroachments of law|le&s;s power, are painted in the mo&s;t lively, as well as the mo&s;t amiable colours. On the other &s;ide, his manner of introducing on the &s;tage a prince, who&s;e chief aim is to perpetuate his name to po&s;|terity, by that havock and ruin he &s;catters through the world, are all drawn with that pomp of hor|ror, and dete&s;tation, which &s;uch mon&s;trous actions de&s;erve. And, &s;ince nothing could be more calculated for rai&s;ing in the minds of the audience a true pa&s;&s;ion for liberty, and a ju&s;t abhorrence of &s;lavery, how this play came to be di&s;couraged, next to a prohibition, in the latter end of queen Anne's reign, I leave it to others to give a rea&s;on.'</Q></P>
<P>Thus far Dr. Welwood, who has endeavoured to point out the &s;imiliarity of the character of Tamerlane, to that of king William. Though it is certainly true, that the Tamerlane of Rowe con|tains grander &s;entiments than any of his other plays; yet, it may be a matter of di&s;pute whether Tamer|lane ought to give name to the play; for Tamerlane is victorious, and Bajazet the &s;ufferer. Be&s;ides the
<PB N="276" REF="279">
fate of the&s;e two monarchs, there is likewi&s;e con|tained in it, the Epi&s;ode of Mone&s;es, and Arpa&s;ia, which is of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently di&s;tre&s;sful to make the &s;ubject of a tragedy. The attention is diverted from the fall of Bajazet, which ought to have been the main de&s;ign, and bewildered in the fortunes of Mone&s;es, and Arpa&s;ia, Axalla and Selima: There are in &s;hort, in this play, events enough for four; and in the variety and importance of them, Tamerlane and Bajazet mu&s;t be too much neglected. All the cha|racters of a play &s;hould be &s;ubordinate to the leading one, and their bu&s;ine&s;s in the drama &s;ub&s;ervient to promote his fate; but this performance is not the tragedy of Bajazet, or Tamerlane only; but likewi&s;e the tragedies of Mone&s;es and Arpa&s;ia, Axala and Selima. It is now performed annually, on the 4th and 5th of November, in commemoration of the Gun-powder Trea&s;on, and the landing of king Wil|liam in this rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">m, when an occa&s;ional prologue is &s;poken.</P>
<P>Another tragedy of Mr. Rowe's is the Fair Penitent, acted at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; and dedicated to the duche&s;s of Ormond; This is one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed performances of our author. The character of Sciolto the father is &s;trongly marked; Horatio's the mo&s;t amiable of all characters, and is &s;o &s;u&s;tained as to &s;trike an audience very forcibly. In this, as in the former play, Mr. Rowe is guilty of a mi&s;-nomer; for his Cali&s;ta has not the lea&s;t claim to be called the Fair Penitent, which would be better changed to the Fair Wanton; for &s;he di&s;covers not one pang of remor&s;e till the la&s;t act, and that &s;eems to ari&s;e more from the external di&s;tre&s;s to which &s;he is then expo&s;ed, than to any compunctions of con&s;cience. She &s;till loves and doats on her ba&s;e betrayer, though a mo&s;t in&s;ignificant creature. In this character, Rowe has been true to the &s;ex, in drawing a woman, as &s;he generally is, fond of her &s;educer; but he has not
<PB N="277" REF="280">
drawn a Penitent. The character of Altamont is one of tho&s;e which the pre&s;ent players ob&s;erve, is the harde&s;t to repre&s;ent of any in the drama; there is a kind of meanne&s;s in him, joined with an un|&s;u&s;pecting hone&s;t heart, and a doating fondne&s;s for the fal&s;e fair one, that is very difficult to illu&s;trate: This part has of late been generally given to performers of but very moderate abilities; by which the play &s;uffers prodigiou&s;ly, and Altamont, who is really one of the mo&s;t important per&s;ons in the drama, is beheld with neglect, or perhaps with contempt; but &s;eldom with pity. Altamont, in the hands of a good actor, would draw the eyes of the audience, notwith&s;tanding the blu&s;tering Lothario, and the &s;uperior dignity of Horatio; for there is &s;omething in Altamont, to create our pity, and work upon our compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>So many players failing of late, in the this cha|racter, leaves it a matter of doubt, whether the actor is mo&s;t mi&s;taken in his performance; or the manager in the di&s;tribution of parts.</P>
<P>The next tragedy Mr. Rowe wrote was his Uly&s;&s;es, acted at the queen's Theatre, in the Hay-Market, and dedicated to the earl of Godolphin. This play is not at pre&s;ent in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage, though it de&s;erves highly to be &s;o, as the character of Pene|lope, is an excellent example of conjugal fidelity: Who, though her lord had been ten years ab&s;ent from her, and various accounts had been given of his death, yet, notwith&s;tanding this, and the addre&s;&s;es of many royal &s;uitors, &s;he pre&s;erved her heart for her Uly&s;&s;es, who at la&s;t triumphed over his enemies, and re&s;|cued his faithful queen from the per&s;ecution of her wooers.&mdash;This play has bu&s;ine&s;s, pa&s;&s;ion, and tragic propriety to recommend it.&mdash;</P>
<P>The next play Mr. Rowe brought upon the &s;tage, was his Royal Convert, acted at the queen's Theatre, in the Haymarket, and dedicated to the earl of Hallifax.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="281" MS="y">
His next was the Tragedy of Jane Shore, writter in imitation of Shake&s;pear's &s;tile; acted at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, and dedicated to the duke of Queen&s;berry and Dover. How Mr. Rowe could imagine that this play is written at all in imitation of Shake&s;pear's &s;tile, we cannot con|ceive; for &s;o far as we are able to judge, it bears not the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to that of Shake&s;pear. The conduct of the de&s;ign is regular, and in that &s;en&s;e it partakes not of Shake&s;pear's wildne&s;s; the poetry is uniform, which marks it to be Rowe's, but in that it is very different from Shake&s;pear, who&s;e excellency does not con&s;i&s;t merely in the beauty of &s;oft language, or nightingale de&s;crip|tions; but in the general power of his drama, the boldne&s;s of the images, and the force of his characters.</P>
<P>Our author afterwards brought upon the &s;tage his Lady Jane Grey, dedicated to the earl of Warwick; this play is ju&s;tly in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;tage likewi&s;e. Mr. Edmund Smith, of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;t's-Church, author of Phaedra and Hyppolitus, de&s;igned writing a Tra|gedy on this &s;ubject; and at his death left &s;ome loo&s;e hints of &s;entiments, and &s;hort &s;ketches of &s;cenes. From the la&s;t of the&s;e, Mr. Rowe acknow|ledges he borrowed part of one, and in&s;erted it in his third act, viz. that between lord Guilford, and lady Jane. It is not much to be regretted, that Mr. Smith did not live to fini&s;h this, &s;ince it fell into the hands of one &s;o much above him, as a dramati&s;t; for if we may judge of Mr. Smith's abilities of writing for the &s;tage, by his Phaedra and Hyppolitus, it would not have been &s;o well executed as by Rowe. Phaedra and Hyppolitus, is a play without pa&s;&s;ion, though of inimitable ver&s;ification; and in the words of a living poet,
<PB N="279" REF="282">
we may &s;ay of it, that not the character, but poet &s;peaks.</P>
<P>It may be ju&s;tly &s;aid of all Rowe's Tragedies, that never poet painted virtue, religion, and all the relative and &s;ocial duties of life, in a more alluring dre&s;s, on the &s;tage; nor were ever vice or im|piety, better expo&s;ed to contempt and abhorrence.</P>
<P>The &s;ame principles of liberty he had early imbibed him&s;elf, &s;eemed a part of his con&s;titu|tion, and appeared in every thing he wrote; and he took all occa&s;ions that fell in his way, to make his talents &s;ub&s;ervient to them: His Mu&s;e was &s;o religiou&s;ly cha&s;te, that I do not remember, &s;ays Dr. Welwood, one wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d in any of his plays or writings, that might admit of a double meaning in any point of decency, or morals. There is nothing to be found in them, to flatter a depraved populace, or humour a fa&s;hionable folly.</P>
<P>Mr. Rowe's Plays were written from the heart, He practi&s;ed the virtue he admired, and he never, in his gaye&s;t moments, &s;uffered him&s;elf to talk loo&s;e|ly or lightly upon religious or moral &s;ubjects; or to turn any thing &s;acred, or which good men reverenced as &s;uch, into ridicule.</P>
<P>Our author wrote a comedy of three acts, called the Biter. It was performed at the Theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields; but without &s;ucce&s;s, for Rowe's genius did not lie towards Comedy.&mdash;In a conver&s;ation he had with Mr. Pope, that great poet advi&s;ed him to re&s;cue the queen of Scots, from the hands of Banks; and to make that lady to &s;hine on the &s;tage, with a lu&s;tre equal to her character. Mr. Rowe ob&s;erved in an&s;wer to this, that he was a great admirer of queen Elizabeth; and as he could not well plan a play upon the queen of Scots's &s;tory, without introducing his favourite prince&s;s, who in that particular makes but an indifferent figure, he cho&s;e to decline it: Be&s;ides, he knew that if he favoured the northern lady, there was a &s;trong party
<PB N="280" REF="283">
concerned to cru&s;h it; and if he &s;hould make her appear le&s;s great than &s;he was, and throw a &s;hade over her real endowments, he &s;hould violate truth, and incur the di&s;plea&s;ure of a faction, which though by far the minority, he knew would be yet too powerful for a poet to combat with.</P>
<P>The late duke of Queen&s;berry, when &s;ecretary of &s;tate, made Mr. Rowe &s;ecretary for public affairs; and when that nobleman came to know him well, he was never more delighted than when in his com|pany: After the duke's death, all avenues were &s;topt to his preferment; and during the re&s;t of queen Anne's reign, he pa&s;&s;ed his time with the Mu&s;es and his books, and &s;ometimes with the conver&s;ation of his friends.</P>
<P>While Mr. Rowe was thus without a patron, he went one day to pay his court to the earl of Oxford, lord high trea&s;urer of England, then at the head of the Tory faction, who a&s;ked him if he under&s;tood Spani&s;h well? He an&s;wered no: but imagining that his lord&s;hip might intend to &s;end him into Spain on &s;ome honourable commi&s;&s;ion, he pre&s;ently added, that in a &s;hort time he did not doubt but he &s;hould pre|&s;ently be able, both to under&s;tand it, and &s;peak it. The earl approving of what he &s;aid, Mr. Rowe took his leave, and immediately retired out of town to a private country farm; where, within a few months, he learned the Spani&s;h tongue, and then waited again on the earl to give him an account of his diligence. His lord&s;hip a&s;king him, if he was &s;ure he under&s;tood it thoroughly, and Mr. Rowe an|&s;wering in the affirmative, the earl bur&s;t into an ex|clamation; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'How happy are you Mr. Rowe, that you can enjoy the plea&s;ure of reading, and under|&s;tanding Don Quixote in the original!'</Q></P>
<P>This wanton cruelty inflicted by his lord|&s;hip, of rai&s;ing expectations in the mind, that he never intended to gratify, needs only be told to excite indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="284">
Upon the acce&s;&s;ion of king George the I&s;t. to the throne, Mr. Rowe was made Poet-Laureat, and one of the &s;urveyors of the cu&s;toms, in the port of London. The prince of Wales conferred on him, the place of clerk of his council, and the lord chancellor Parker, made him his &s;ecretary for the pre&s;entations, the very day he received the &s;eals, and without his a&s;king it.</P>
<P>He was twice married, fir&s;t to a daughter of Mr. auditor Par&s;ons; and afterwards to a daughter of Mr. Deveni&s;h of a good family in Dor&s;et&s;hire. By his fir&s;t wife, he had a &s;on, and by his &s;econd a daughter.</P>
<P>Mr. Rowe died the 6th of December 1718, in the 45th year of his age, like a chri&s;tian and a philo&s;o|pher, and with an unfeigned re&s;ignation to the will of God: He pre&s;erved an evenne&s;s of temper to the la&s;t, and took leave of his wife, and friends, immediately before his la&s;t agony, with the &s;ame tranquility of mind, as if he had been taking but a &s;hort journey.</P>
<P>He was interred in We&s;tmin&s;ter-Abbey, over again&s;t Chaucer; his body being attended with a va&s;t number of friends, and the dean and chapter officiating at the funeral. A tomb was afterwards erected to his memory, by his wife, for which Mr. Pope wrote an epitaph, which we &s;hall here in&s;ert; not one word of which is hyperbolical, or more than he de&s;erves.<Q><PB N="282" REF="285">Epitaph on ROWE, by Mr. POPE.

him&s;elf a volunteer in the &s;econd Dutch war; and accordingly was in that famous naval engagement, where the duke of York commanded as admiral, on which occa&s;ion his lord&s;hip behaved him&s;elf &s;o gal|lantly, that he was appointed commander of the royal Katherine, a &s;econd rate man of war.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip in his own Memoirs, tells us, that when he entered him&s;elf a volunteer under his royal highne&s;s the duke of York, he was then deeply engaged, and under the &s;oft influence of love: He &s;ays, he never &s;hall forget the tenderne&s;s of parting from his mi&s;tre&s;s. On this account double honour is due to him:&mdash;To enter the bu&s;tle of war, without any other call, but that of honour, at an age when mo&s;t young noblemen are under the tuition of a dancing ma&s;ter, argued a generous intrepid nature; but to leave the arms of his mi&s;|tre&s;s, to tear him&s;elf from her he doated on, in order to &s;erve his country, carries in it yet a higher degree of merit, and ought to put all young men of fortune to the blu&s;h, who would rather meanly riot in luxurious ea&s;e at home, than do honour to them&s;elves and their country, by endeavouring to &s;erve it.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip acknowledges in the above-menti|oned Memoirs, that the duke of York did wonders in the engagement; and that he was as intrepid in his nature, as &s;ome of his enemies &s;uppo&s;ed him to be of an oppo&s;ite character; though, &s;ays he, alluding to what afterwards happened, misfortunes, age, and other accidents, will make a great man differ from him&s;elf. We find our young nobleman while he was aboard a &s;hip, amid&s;t the noi&s;e of the crew, could yet indulge his genius for poetry. One would imagine that the ocean is too boi&s;terous an element for the Mu&s;es, who&s;e darling wi&s;h is for ea&s;e and retirement; yet, we find him amid&s;t the roaring of winds and waves, open his Poem with the&s;e &s;oothing lines.<Q><PB N="287" REF="290"><L>Within the &s;ilent &s;hades of &s;oft repo&s;e,</L>

<P>As Tangier was in danger of being taken by the Moors, he offered to head the forces which were to defend it; and accordingly he was appointed com|mander of them. He was then earl of Mulgrave, and one of the lords of the bed-chamber to king Charles the IId. In May 28, 1674, he was in&s;talled knight of the Garter.</P>
<P>As he now began to be eminent at court, it was impo&s;&s;ible but he mu&s;t have enemies, and the&s;e ene|mies being mean enough to hint &s;tories to his pre|judice, in regard to &s;ome ladies, with whom the king was not unconcerned; his lord&s;hip's command was not made &s;o agreeable as it otherwi&s;e would have been. The particulars of this affair have been di&s;puted by hi&s;torians, &s;ome have imagined it to refer to &s;ome celebrated courtezan, who&s;e affections his lord&s;hip weaned from the king, and drew them to him&s;elf; but Mrs. Manly, in her new Atalantis, and Boyer, in his Hi&s;tory of queen Anne, a&s;&s;ign a very different cau&s;e.

Orgueil. Boyer &s;ays, &s;ome years before the queen was married to prince George of Denmark, the earl of Mulgrave, a nobleman of &s;ingular accompli&s;h|ments, both of mind and per&s;on, a&s;pired &s;o high as to attempt to marry the lady Anne; but though his addre&s;&s;es to her were checked, as &s;oon as di&s;covered, yet the prince&s;s had ever an e&s;teem for him.</P>
<P>This account is more probably true, than the former; when it is con&s;idered, that by &s;ending the earl to Tangier<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Dictionary. See Article Sheffield.</NOTE>, a &s;cheme was laid for de&s;troying him, and all the crew aboard the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el. For the &s;hip which was appointed to carry the general of the forces, was in &s;uch a condition, that the captain of her declared, he was afraid to make the voyage. Upon this repre&s;entation, lord Mulgrave applied both to the lord admiral, and the king him|&s;elf: The fir&s;t &s;aid, the &s;hip was &s;afe enough, and no other could be then procured. The king an|&s;wered him coldly, that he hoped it would do, and that he &s;hould give him&s;elf no trouble about it. His lord&s;hip was reduced to the extremity either of going in a leaky &s;hip, or ab&s;olutely refu&s;ing; which he knew his enemies would impute to cowardice, and as he abhorred the imputation, he re&s;olved, in oppo&s;ition to the advice of his friends, to hazard all; but at the &s;ame time advi&s;ed &s;everal volunteers of quality, not to accompany him in the expedition, as their ho|nour was not &s;o much engaged as his; &s;ome of whom wi&s;ely took his advice, but the earl of Plymouth, natural &s;on of the king, piqued him|&s;elf in running the &s;ame danger with a man who went to &s;erve his father, and yet was u&s;ed &s;o &s;trangely by the ill-offices of his mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Providence, however defeated the mini&s;terial &s;cheme of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, by giving them the fine&s;t weather during the voyage, which held three weeks,
<PB N="289" REF="292">
and by pumping all the time, they landed &s;afe at la&s;t at Tangier, where they met with admiral Her|bert, afterwards earl of Torrington, who could not but expre&s;s his admiration, at their having performed &s;uch a voyage in a &s;hip he had &s;ent home as unfit for &s;ervice; but &s;uch was the undi&s;turbed tranquility and native firmne&s;s of the earl of Mulgrave's mind, that in this hazardous voyage, he compo&s;ed the Poem, part of which we have quoted.</P>
<P>Had the earl of Mulgrave been guilty of any offence, capital, or otherwi&s;e, the mini&s;try might have called him to account for it; but their con|triving, and the king's con&s;enting to &s;o bloody a purpo&s;e, is methinks &s;uch a &s;tain upon them, as can never be wiped off; and had that nobleman and the &s;hip's crew peri&s;hed, they would have added actual murther, to concerted ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the approach of his lord&s;hip's forces, the Moors retired, and the re&s;ult of this expedition was, the blowing up of Tangier. Some time after the king was appea&s;ed, the earl forgot the ill offices, that had been done him; and enjoyed his maje&s;ty's favour to the la&s;t. He continued in &s;everal great po&s;ts during the &s;hort reign of king James the IId, till that prince abdicated the throne. As the earl con&s;tantly and zealou&s;ly advi&s;ed him again&s;t &s;everal imprudent mea&s;ures, which were taken by the court, the king, &s;ome months before the revolution, began to grow cooler towards him; but yet was &s;o equitable as not to remove him from his preferments: And after the king lo&s;t his crown, he had the inward &s;atisfaction, to be con&s;cious, that his councils had not contributed to that prince's misfortunes; and that him&s;elf, in any manner, had not forfeited his honour and integrity.</P>
<P>That his lord&s;hip was no violent friend to, or promoter of, the revolution, &s;eems to appear from his conduct during that remarkable aera;
<PB N="290" REF="293">
and particularly from the unfini&s;hed relation he left concerning it, which was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed &s;ome years ago, by order of the government.</P>
<P>In a pa&s;&s;age in his lord&s;hip's writings, it appears he was unwilling that king James &s;hould leave England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. p. 106.</NOTE>. Ju&s;t as the king was &s;tepping into bed the night before his going away, the earl of Mul|grave came into the bed-chamber, which, being at &s;o late an hour, might po&s;&s;ibly give the king &s;ome apprehen&s;ions of that lord's &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">pecting his de&s;ign, with which he was re&s;olved not to tru&s;t him, nor any prote&s;tant: He therefore &s;topped &s;hort, and turned about to whi&s;per him in the ear, that his commi&s;&s;ioners had newly &s;ent him a very hope|ful account of &s;ome accommodation with the Prince of Orange; to which that lord only replied with a que&s;tion, a&s;king him if the Prince's army halted, or approached nearer to London? the King owned they &s;till marched on; at which the earl &s;hook his head, and &s;aid no more, only made him a low bow, with a dejected countenance, hum|bly to make him under&s;tand that he gave no cre|dit to what the King's hard circum&s;tances at that time obliged him to di&s;&s;emble. It al&s;o appears that the earl of Mulgrave was one of tho&s;e lords, who, immediately after the King's departure, &s;ent letters to the fleet, to the abandoned army of King James, and to all the con&s;iderable garri&s;ons in Eng|land, which kept them in order and &s;ubjection, not only to the pre&s;ent authority, but that which &s;hould be &s;ettled afterwards.</P>
<P>To his lord&s;hip's humanity was owing the pro|tection King James obtained from the Lords in London, upon his being &s;eized, and in&s;ulted by the populace at Fever&s;ham in Kent; before which time, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the Peers &s;at daily in the council

chamber in Whitehall, where the lord Mulgrave one morning happened to be adverti&s;ed pri|vately that the King had been &s;eized by the an|gry rabble at Fever&s;ham, and had &s;ent a poor countryman with the news, in order to procure his re&s;cue, which was like to come too late, &s;ince the me&s;&s;enger had waited long at the coun|cil door, without any body's being willing to take notice of him. This &s;ad account moved him with great compa&s;&s;ion at &s;o extraordinary an in&s;tance of worldly uncertainty; and no cautions of offending the prevailing party were able to re&s;train him from &s;hewing a little indignation at &s;o mean a proceeding in the council; upon which, their new pre&s;ident, the marquis of Hallifax, would have adjourned it ha&s;tily, in order to pre|vent him. But the lord Mulgrave earne&s;tly conjured them all to &s;it down again, that he might acquaint them with a matter that admitted no delay, and was of the highe&s;t importance ima|ginable. Accordingly the Lords, who knew no|thing of the bu&s;ine&s;s, could not but hearken to it; and tho&s;e few that gue&s;&s;ed it, and &s;aw the con&s;equence, yet wanted time enough for con|certing together about &s;o nice, and very impor|tant a matter, as &s;aving, or lo&s;ing a King's life. The Lords then &s;at down again, and he repre|&s;ented to them what barbarity it would be, for &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly's conniving at the rabble's tear|ing to pieces, even any private gentleman, much more a great Prince, who, with all his popery, was &s;till their Sovereign; &s;o that mere &s;hame o|bliged them to &s;u&s;pend their politics awhile, and call in the me&s;&s;enger, who told them with tears, how the King had engaged him to deli|ver a letter from him to any per&s;ons he could find willing to &s;ave him from &s;o imminent a danger. The letter had no &s;uper&s;cription, and was to this effect;'<P><PB N="292" REF="295">
'To acquaint the reader of it, that he had been di&s;covered in his retreat by &s;ome fi&s;hermen of Kent, and &s;ecured at fir&s;t there by the gentry, who were afterwards forced to re&s;ign him into the hands of an in&s;olent rabble.'</P>
<P>'Upon &s;o pre&s;&s;ing an occa&s;ion, and now &s;o very publickly made known, the council was &s;urprized, and under &s;ome difficulty, for as there was danger of di&s;plea&s;ing by doing their duty, &s;o there was no le&s;s by omitting it, &s;ince the Law makes it highly criminal in &s;uch an extremity; be&s;ides that mo&s;t of them as yet unacquainted with the Prince of Orange, imagined him prudent, and con&s;equently capable of puni&s;hing &s;o ba&s;e a de&s;ertion, either out of genero&s;ity, or policy. The&s;e found afterwards their caution needle&s;s, but at pre&s;ent it influenced the council to &s;end 200 of the life guards under their captain the earl of Fever&s;ham; fir&s;t to re&s;cue the King from all danger of the common people, and afterwards to attend him toward the &s;ea &s;ide; if he continued his re&s;olution of retiring, which they thought it more decent to connive at. than to detain him here by force.'</P></Q></P>
<P>Whoever has the lea&s;t &s;park of genero&s;ity in his nature, cannot but highly applaud this tender con|duct of his lord&s;hip's, towards his Sovereign in di&s;tre&s;s; and look with contempt upon the &s;low|ne&s;s of the council in di&s;patching a force to his relief, e&s;pecially when we find it was only out of dread, le&s;t they &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e the Prince of Orange, that they &s;ent any: this &s;hewed a mean|ne&s;s of &s;pirit, a want of true honour, to &s;uch a degree, that the Prince of Orange him&s;elf could not, con&s;i&s;tently with good policy, tru&s;t tho&s;e wor|&s;hippers of power, who could hear, unconcerned, that their late Sovereign was in the hands of a vile rabble, and intreating them in vain for re&s;cue.</P>

The earl of Mulgrave made no mean compli|ances to King William, immediately after the re|volution, but when he went to pay his addre&s;&s;es to him, he was well received; yet did he not accept of a po&s;t in the government till &s;ome years after.</P>
<P>May 10, in the 6th year of William and Mary, he was created marquis of Normanby, in the county of Lincoln. When it was debated in Par|liament, whether the Prince of Orange &s;hould be proclaimed King, or the Prince&s;s his wife reign &s;olely in her own right, he voted and &s;poke for the former, and gave the&s;e rea&s;ons for it. That he thought the title of either per&s;on was equal; and &s;ince the Parliament was to decide the matter, he judged it would much better plea&s;e that Prince, who was now become their Protector, and was al|&s;o in it&s;elf a thing more becoming &s;o good a Prince&s;s, as Queen Mary, to partake with her hu&s;|band a crown &s;o obtained, than to po&s;&s;e&s;s it entire|ly as her own. After long debates in Parliament, the crown at la&s;t was &s;ettled upon William and Mary. Burnet lord bi&s;hop of Sali&s;bury, who&s;e af|fection for the revolution none I believe can doubt, freely acknowledges that the King was re&s;olved not to hold the government by right of his wife; he would not think of holding any thing by a|pron &s;trings:' he was jealous of the friends of his wife, and never forgave them; and, la&s;t of all, he threatened to leave them in the lurch, that is, to retire to Holland, with his Dutch army; &s;o re&s;tle&s;s, &s;ays Mulgrave in another place, is ambition, in its highe&s;t &s;cenes of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>During the reign of King William however, he enjoyed &s;ome con&s;iderable po&s;ts, and was generally pretty well in his favour, and con|fidence. April 21, 1702, he was &s;worn Lord Pri|vy Seal, and the &s;ame year appointed one of the commi&s;&s;ioners to treat of an union between Eng|land and Scotland, and was made Lord Lieute|nant, and Cu&s;tos Rotulorum for the North Rid|ing

of York&s;hire, and one of the governors of the Charterhou&s;e.</P>
<P>March 9, 1703, he was created duke of Nor|manby, having been made marquis of Normanby by King William, and on the 19th of the &s;ame m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nth duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uckingham.

<P>In 1710 the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">hig mini&s;try began to lo&s;e ground, and Mr. Harley, &s;ince earl of Oxford, and the Lord Trea&s;urer made the proper u&s;e of tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, yet wanting &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, applied to the duke of Buckingham. The duke, who was not then on good terms with Mr. Harley, at fir&s;t &s;lighted his propo&s;al, but afterwards joined with him and others, which produced a revolution in the mini&s;try, and &s;hook the power of the duke and duche&s;s of Marlborough, while Mr. Harley, the earl of Shrew&s;bury, lord Bolingbroke, &amp;c. came into the admini&s;tration. The duke was attached to Tory principles. Her Maje&s;ty offered to make him chancellor, which he thought proper to refu&s;e. He was out of employment for &s;ome time, during which, he did not &s;o much as pay his compliments at court, 'till he married his third wife, and then went to ki&s;s her Maje&s;ty's hand.</P>
<P>The duke of Buckingham, though reckoned haughty, and ill natured, was yet of a tender, com|pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;po&s;ition; but as the be&s;t charac|ters have generally &s;ome allay, he is allowed to have been very pa&s;&s;ionate; but after his warmth &s;ub|&s;ided, he endeavoured to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">one for it by acts of kind|ne&s;s and beneficence to tho&s;e upon whom his pa&s;&s;ion had vented it&s;elf.

Among&s;t his poems, an E&s;&s;ay on Poetry, which contains excel|lent in&s;tructions to form the poet, is by far the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed.

<P>His grace was a great lover of the polite arts in general, as appears from the fondne&s;s he expre&s;&s;es for them in &s;everal parts of his works; particular|ly Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture; of the two former he made &s;everal cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ious collections, and his hou&s;e, built under his direction in St. James's Park, &s;peaks him not unacquainted with the lat|ter.

Dryden in &s;everal of his De|dications, while he expre&s;&s;es the warmth of his gra|titude, fails not to convey the mo&s;t amiable idea of his lord&s;hip, and repre&s;ents him as a noble writer.

I &s;hall add but one other te&s;timony of his me|rit, which if &s;ome &s;hould think unnece&s;&s;ary, yet it is plea&s;ing; the lines are delightfully &s;weet and flowing. In his Mi&s;cellanies thus &s;peaks Mr. Pope;<Q><L>' Mu&s;e 'tis enough, at length thy labour ends,</L>

<P>The two plays of Julius Cae&s;ar, which he altered from Shake&s;pear, are both with Choru&s;&s;es, after the manner of the Ancients: The&s;e plays were to have been performed in the year 1729, and all the Choru&s;&s;es were &s;et to mu&s;ic by that great ma&s;ter in compo&s;ition, Signor Bononcini; but Engli&s;h voices being few, the Italians were applied to, who demanded more for their nightly performance, than the receipts of the hou&s;e could amount to at the u&s;ual rai&s;ed prices, and on that account the de|&s;ign was dropt.</P>
<P>It appears that our noble author had conceived a great regard for Mr. Pope, on his earlie&s;t ap|pearance in the literary world; and was among the fir&s;t to acknowledge the young bard's merit, in commendatory ver&s;es upon his excellence in poetry.

<HEAD>CHARLES COTTON, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS ingenious gentleman lived in the reigns of Charles and James II. He re&s;ided for a great part of his life at Beresford in the county of Stafford. He had &s;ome reputation for lyric po|etry, but was particularly famous for burle&s;que ver&s;e. He tran&s;lated from the French Mon&s;ieur Corneille's Horace, printed in 4to. London 1671, and dedicated to his dear &s;i&s;ter Mrs. Stanhope Hutchin&s;on. This play was fir&s;t fini&s;hed in 1665, but in his prefatory epi&s;tle he tells us, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'that nei|ther at that time, nor for &s;everal years after, was it intended for the public view, it being written for the private diverti&s;ement of a fair young lady, and, ever &s;ince it had the honour fir&s;t to ki&s;s her hands, was &s;o entirely hers, that the author did not re&s;erve &s;o much as the Brouillon to him&s;elf; however, &s;he being prevailed upon, though with &s;ome difficulty, it was printed in 8vo. 1670.'</Q> As to the merit of this play in the origi|nal, it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the critics have allowed it to be the be&s;t tragedy of Corneille, and the author him&s;elf is of the &s;ame opinion, provid|ed the three la&s;t acts had been equal to the two fir&s;t. As to the tran&s;lation by Mr. Cotton, we have very con&s;iderable authority to pronounce it better than that of Mrs. Katherine Philips, who could not number ver&s;ification among her qualities. The plot of this play, &s;o far as hi&s;tory is concerned, may be

read in Livy, Florus, Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;eus, &amp;c. Our &s;tage has lately had a play founded up|on this &s;tory, added to the many it has received, called the Roman Father, by Mr. W. Whitehead.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this tran&s;lation, Mr. Cotton is author of many other works, &s;uch as his poem called the Won|ders of the Peak, printed in 8vo. London 1681<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. . Cotton's works are printed together in one volumo, 12mo. The thirteenth edition is dated 1751.</NOTE>. His burle&s;que Poem, called Scarronides, or Virgil Trave&s;tie, a mock Poem, on the fir&s;t and fourth Books of Virgil's Aeneid, printed in 8vo. London 1678. Though the title &s;eems to imply as if his poem was in imitation of Scarron, who has tran|&s;lated eight books of Virgil in the &s;ame manner, yet they who will compare both the&s;e pieces, will po&s;&s;ibly find, that he has not only exceeded the French, but all tho&s;e who have made any attempts on that kind of poetry, the incomparable author of Hudibras excepted. Mr. Cotton likewi&s;e tran&s;lated &s;everal of Lucian's Dialogues into burle&s;que ver&s;e, printed in 8vo. London 1675, under the title of the Scoffer Scoff'd. In 1689 a volume of poems, with Mr. Cotton's name prefixed, was publi&s;hed in London: on the&s;e poems colonel Lovelace, Sir A&s;ton Cockaine, Ro|bert Harrick, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Mr. Alexander Brome, complimented the author by copies of ver&s;es pre|fixed; but Mr. Langbain ob&s;erves, that the true&s;t picture of Mr. Cotton's mind is to be &s;een in a little piece publi&s;hed at the end of the&s;e poems called Retirement; but the chief of Mr. Cotton's production, &s;eems to be his tran&s;lation of Mon|taigne's E&s;&s;ays, dedicated to George Lord Saville, Marquis of Hallifax; his lord&s;hip in a letter to him, thus expre&s;&s;es his e&s;teem for the tran&s;lator, and admiration of his performance.

<P>We cannot be certain in what year our author died, but it was probably &s;ome time about the revolution.

<HEAD>The Right Honourable JOSEPH ADDISON, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS elegant writer, to whom the world owes &s;o many obligations, was born at Mil|ton near Ambro&s;bury in the county of Wilts (of which place his father, Mr. Lancelot Addi&s;on, was then rector) on the 6th of May 1672; and be|ing not thought likely to live, was baptized on the &s;ame day, as appears from the church regi&s;ter. When he grew up to an age fit for going to &s;chool, he was put under the care of the rev. Mr. Nai&s;h at Ambro&s;bury. He afterwards removed to a &s;chool at Salisbury, taught by the rev. Mr. Taylor, thence to the Charter-hou&s;e, where he was under the tuition of the learned Dr. Ellis, and where he contracted an intimacy with Mr. Steel, afterwards Sir Richard, which continued as long as Mr. Ad|di&s;on lived. He was not above fifteen years old when he was entered of Queen's College, Oxford, in which his father had been placed: where he applied him&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely to the &s;tudy of cla&s;&s;ical learning, that in a very &s;hort time he became ma&s;ter of a very elegant Latin &s;tile, even before he arrived at that age when ordinary &s;cholars begin to write good Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>In the year 1687 a copy of his ver&s;es in that tongue fell into the hands of Dr. Lanca&s;ter dean of Magdalen College, who was &s;o plea&s;ed with them, that he immediately procured their author's election into that hou&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickell's Preface to Addi&s;on's works.</NOTE>; where he took the de|grees
<PB N="306" REF="309">
of bachelor, and ma&s;ter of arts. In the cour&s;e of a few years his Latin poetry was ju&s;tly admired at both the univer&s;ities, and procured him great reputation there, before his name was &s;o much as known in London. When he was in the 22d year of his age, he publi&s;hed a copy of ver&s;es addre&s;&s;ed to Mr. Dryden, which &s;oon procured him the no|tice of &s;ome of the poetical judges in that age. The ver&s;es are not without their elegance, but if they are much removed above common rhimes, they fall infinitely &s;hort of the character Mr. Addi|&s;on's friends be&s;towed upon them. Some little &s;pace intervening, he &s;ent into the world a tran&s;lation of the 4th Georgic of Virgil, of which we need not &s;ay any more, than that it was commended by Mr. Dryden. He wrote al&s;o that di&s;cour&s;e on the Georgics, prefixed to them by way of preface in Mr. Dryden's tran&s;lation, and cho&s;e to with|hold his name from that judicious compo&s;ition, be|cau&s;e it contained an untried &s;train of cri|tici&s;m, which bore hard upon the old profe&s;&s;ors of that art, and therefore was not &s;o fit for a young man to take upon him&s;elf; and Mr. Dryden, who was above the meanne&s;s of fathering any one's work, owns the E&s;&s;ay on the Georgics to have come from a friend, who&s;e name is not mentioned, becau&s;e he de&s;ired to have it concealed.</P>
<P>The next year Mr. Addi&s;on wrote &s;everal poems of different kinds; among&s;t the re&s;t, one addre&s;&s;ed to Henry Sacheverel, who became afterwards &s;o exceedingly famous. The following year he wrote a poem to King William on one of his Campaigns, addre&s;&s;ed to the Lord Keeper (Sir John Somers.) That excellent &s;tate&s;man received this mark of a young author's attachment with great humanity, admitted Mr. Addi&s;on into the number of his friends, and gave him on all occa&s;ions di&s;tingui&s;h|ing proofs of a &s;incere e&s;teem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickell.

While he was at the univer&s;ity, he had been pre&s;&s;ingly &s;ollicited to enter into holy orders, which he &s;eemed once re&s;olved on, probably in obedi|ence to his father's authority; but being con&s;cious of the importance of the undertaking, and de|terred by his extreme mode&s;ty, he relinqui&s;hed, &s;ays Mr. Tickell, all views that way; but Sir Ri|chard Steel in his letter to Mr. Congreve prefixed to the Drummer, who had a quarrel with Tickell, on account of an injurious treatment of him, &s;ays, that tho&s;e were not the rea&s;ons which made Mr. Addi&s;on turn his thoughts to the civil world, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'and as you were the inducement (&s;ays he) of his be|coming acquainted with my lord Hallifax, I doubt not but you remember the warm in&s;tances that noble lord made to the head of the college, not to in&s;i&s;t on Mr. Addi&s;on's going into orders; his arguments were &s;ounded on the general pra|vity and corruption of men of bu&s;ine&s;s, who wanted liberal education; and I remember, as if I had read the letter ye&s;terday, that my lord end|ed with a compliment, that however he might be repre&s;ented as no friend to the church, he would never do it any other injury than by keeping Mr. Addi&s;on out of it.'</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on having di&s;covered an inclination to travel, the abovementioned patron, out of zeal, as well to his country, as our author, procured him from the crown an annual pen&s;ion of 300 l. which enabled him to make a tour to Italy the latter end of 1699. His Latin poems dedicated to Mr. Montague, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, were printed before his departure, in the Mu&s;ae Angli|canae, and were as much e&s;teemed in foreign countries, as at home, particularly by that noble wit of France, Boileau. It is from Mr. Tickell we learn this circum&s;tance in relation to Boileau, and we &s;hall pre&s;ent it to the reader in his own words; <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'his country owes it to Mr. Addi&s;on, that

the famous Mon&s;ieur Boileau fir&s;t conceived an opinion of the Engli&s;h genius for poetry, by pe|ru&s;ing the pre&s;ent he made him of the Mu&s;ae Anglicanae. It has been currently reported, that this famous French poet, among the civilities he &s;hewed Mr. Addi&s;on on that occa&s;ion, affirmed, that he would not have written again&s;t Perrault, had he before &s;een &s;uch excellent pieces by a modern hand. The compliment he meant, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">, that the&s;e books had given him a very new idea of the Engli&s;h politene&s;s, and that he did not que&s;tion, but there were excellent comp &s;itions in the native language of a country, which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed the Roman genius in &s;o eminent a degree.'</Q> In 1701 Mr. Addi&s;on wrote an epi&s;tolary poem from Italy to lord Hallifax, which is much ad|mired as a fini&s;hed piece in its kind, and indeed &s;ome have pronounced it the be&s;t of Mr. Addi&s;on's performances. It was tran&s;lated by the Abbot An|tonio Mario Salvini, Greek Profe&s;&s;or at Florence into Italian ver&s;e, which tran&s;lation is printed with the original in Mr. Tickell's 4to. edition of Mr. Addi&s;on's works. This poem is in the high|e&s;t e&s;teem in Italy, becau&s;e there are in it the be&s;t turned compliments on that country, that, perhaps, are to be found any where: and the Italians, on ac|count of their familiarity with the objects it de&s;cribes, mu&s;t have a higher reli&s;h of it. This poem like|wi&s;e &s;hews his gratitude to lord Hallifax, who had been that year impeached by the Commons in Parliament, for procuring exorbitant grants from the crown to his own u&s;e; and further charged with cutting down, and wa&s;ting the timber in his Maje&s;ty's fore&s;ts, and with holding &s;everal offices in his Maje&s;ty's Exchequer, that were incon&s;i&s;tent, and de&s;igned as checks upon each other: The Commons had likewi&s;e addre&s;&s;ed the King to re|move him from his councils, and pre&s;ence for ever. The&s;e were the cau&s;es of his retiring, and Mr. Ad|di&s;on's
<PB N="309" REF="312">
addre&s;s at this time, was a noble in&s;tance of his fidelity, and &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s to his friends.</P>
<P>On his return to England, he publi&s;hed an ac|count of his travels, dedicated to lord Somers; he would have returned earlier than he did, had not he been thought of as a proper per&s;on to attend prince Eugene, who then commanded for the emperor in Italy, which employment would much have plea&s;ed him; but the death of king William intervening cau&s;ed a ce&s;&s;ation of his pen&s;ion and his hopes.</P>
<P>For a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time he remained at home, and as his friends were out of the mini&s;try, he had no opportunity to di&s;play his abilities, or to meet a competent reward for the honour his works had already done his country. He owed both to an accident: In the year 1704 lord trea&s;urer Godolphin happened to complain to the lord Halli|fax, that the duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim, had not been celebrated in ver&s;e, in the manner it de&s;erved, and told him, that he would take it kind, if his lord&s;hip, who was the patron of the poets, would name a gentleman capable of writing upon &s;o elevated a &s;ubject. Lord Hallifax replied with &s;ome quickne&s;s, that he was well ac|quainted with &s;uch a per&s;on, but that he would not name him; and ob&s;erved, that he had long &s;een with indignation, men of little or no merit, main|tained in pomp and luxury, at the expence of the public, while per&s;ons of too much mode&s;ty, with great abilities, langui&s;hed in ob&s;curity. The trea|&s;urer an&s;wered, very cooly, that he was &s;orry his lord&s;hip had occa&s;ion to make &s;uch an ob&s;ervation; but that in the mean time, he would engage his honour, that whoever his lord&s;hip &s;hould name, might venture upon this theme, without fear of lo&s;ing his time. Lord Hallifax thereupon named Mr. Addi&s;on, but in&s;i&s;ted the trea&s;urer &s;hould &s;end to him him&s;elf, which he promi&s;ed. Accordingly he prevailed upon Mr. Boyle, then chancellor of the
<PB N="310" REF="313">
exchequer, to go in his name to Mr. Addi&s;on, and communicate to him the bu&s;ine&s;s, which he did in &s;o obliging a manner, that he readily entered upon the ta&s;k<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Budgel's Memoirs of the Boyles.</NOTE>. The lord trea&s;urer &s;aw the Poem before it was fini&s;hed, when the author had written no far|ther than the celebrated &s;imile of the Angel, and was &s;o much plea&s;ed with it, that he immediately made him commi&s;&s;ioner of appeals, in the room of Mr. Locke, who was promoted to be one of the lords commi&s;&s;ioners for trade, &amp;c.</P>
<P>His Poem, entitled the Campaign, was received with loud and general applau&s;e: It is addre&s;&s;ed to the duke of Marlborough, and contains a &s;hort view of the military tran&s;actions in the year 1704, and a very particular de&s;cription of the two great actions at Schellemberg and Blenheim.</P>
<P>In 1705 Mr. Addi&s;on attended the lord Hallifax to Hanover; and in the &s;ucceeding year he was made choice of for under-&s;ecretary to Sir Charles Hedges, then appointed &s;ecretary of &s;tate. In the month of December, in the &s;ame year, the earl of Sunderland, who &s;ucceeded Sir Charles in that office, continued Mr. Addi&s;on in the po&s;t of under &s;ecretary.</P>
<P>Operas being now much in fa&s;hion, many people of di&s;tinction and true ta&s;te, importuned him to make a trial, whether &s;en&s;e and &s;ound were really &s;o incompatible, as &s;ome admirers of the Italian pieces would repre&s;ent them. He was at la&s;t pre|vailed upon to comply with their reque&s;t, and compo&s;ed his Ro&s;amond: This piece was in&s;cribed to the duche&s;s of Marlborough, and met with but indifferent &s;ucce&s;s on the &s;tage. Many looked upon it as not properly an Opera; for con&s;idering what numbers of mi&s;erable productions had born that title, they were &s;carce &s;atisfied that &s;o &s;uperior a piece &s;hould appear under the &s;ame denomination About

this time our author a&s;&s;i&s;ted Sir Richard Steel, in a play called the Tender Hu&s;band; to which he wrote a humorous Prologue. Sir Richard, who&s;e gratitude was as warm and ready as his wit, &s;urprized him with a dedication, which may be con&s;idered as one of the few monuments of prai&s;e, not unworthy the great per&s;on to who&s;e honour it was rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>In 1709 he went over to Ireland, as &s;ecretary to the marquis of Wharton, appointed lord lieutenant of that kingdom. Her maje&s;ty al&s;o, was plea&s;ed, as a mark of her peculiar favour, to augment the &s;a|lary annexed to the keeper of the records in that nation, and be&s;tow it upon him. While he was in Ireland, his friend Sir Richard Steel publi&s;hed the Tatler, which appeared for the fir&s;t time, on the 12th of April 1709: Mr. Addi&s;on (&s;ays Tickell) di&s;covered the author by an ob&s;ervation on Virgil he had communicated to him. This di&s;covery led him to afford farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in&s;omuch, that as the author of the Tatler well expre&s;t it, he fared by this means, like a di&s;tre&s;t prince, who calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid: that is, he was un|done by his auxiliary.</P>
<P>The &s;uperiority of Mr. Addi&s;on's papers in that work is univer&s;ally admitted; and being more at lei&s;ure upon the change of the mini&s;try, he continued a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the Tatler till 1711, when it was dropt.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Tatler laid down, but Sir Richard Steel, in concert with Mr. Addi&s;on, formed the plan of the Spectator. The fir&s;t paper appeared on the fir&s;t of March 1711, and in the cour&s;e of that great work, Mr. Addi&s;on furni&s;hed all the pa|pers marked with any Letters of the Mu&s;e CLIO; and which were generally mo&s;t admired. Tickell, who had no kindne&s;s for Sir Richard Steel, meanly &s;uppo&s;es that he marked his paper out of precaution again&s;t Sir Richard; which was an ill-natur'd in|&s;inuation; for in the conclu&s;ion of the Spectators, he acknowledges to Mr. Addi&s;on, all he had a right
<PB N="312" REF="315">
to; and in his letter to Congreve, he declares that Addi&s;on's papers were marked by him, out of tenderne&s;s to his friend, and a warm zeal for his fame. Steel was a generous grateful friend; it therefore ill became Mr. Tickell in the defence of Mr. Addi&s;on's honour, which needed no &s;uch &s;tra tagem, to depreciate one of his deare&s;t friends; and at the expence of truth, and his reputation, rai&s;e the character of his Hero. Sir Richard had oppo&s;ed Mr. Addi&s;on, in the choice of Mr. Tickell as his &s;ecretary; which it &s;eems he could never forget nor forgive.</P>
<P>In the Spectators, Sir Roger de Coverly was Mr. Addi&s;on's favourite character; and &s;o tender was he of it, that he went to Sir Richard, upon his pub|li&s;hing a Spectator, in which he made Sir Roger pick up a woman in the temple cloi&s;ters, and would not part with his friend, until he promi&s;ed to meddle with the old knight's character no more. However, Mr. Addi&s;on to make &s;ure, and to prevent any ab|&s;urdities the writers of the &s;ub&s;equent Spectators might fall into, re&s;olved to remove that character out of the way; or, as he plea&s;antly expre&s;&s;ed it to an intimate friend, killed Sir Roger, that no body el&s;e might murther him. When the old Spectator was fini&s;hed, a new one appeared; but, though written by men of wit and genius, it did not &s;ucceed, and they were wi&s;e enough not to pu&s;h the attempt too far. Po&s;terity mu&s;t have a high idea of the ta&s;te and good &s;en&s;e of the Briti&s;h nation, when they are informed, that twenty-thou&s;and of the&s;e papers were &s;ometimes &s;old in a day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickell's Preface.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Guardian, a paper of the &s;ame tendency, entertained the town in the years 1713 and 1714, in which Mr. Addi&s;on had likewi&s;e a very large &s;hare; he al&s;o wrote two papers in the Lover.</P>

In the year 1713 appeared his famous Cato. He entered into a de&s;ign of writing a Tragedy on that &s;ubject, when he was very young; and when he was on his travels he actually wrote four acts of it: However, he ret<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">uched it on his return, with|out any de&s;ign of bringing it on the &s;tage; but &s;ome friends of his imagining it might be of &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of liberty, he was prevailed upon to fini&s;h it for the theatre, which he accordingly did. When this play appeared, it was received with boundle&s;s admiration; and during the repre&s;entation on the fir&s;t night, on which its fate depended, it is &s;aid that Mr. Addi&s;on di&s;covered uncommon timi|dity; he was agitated between hope and fear, and while he remained retired in the green-room, he kept a per&s;on continually going backwards and forwards, from the &s;tage to the place where he was, to inform him how it &s;ucceeded, and till the whole was over, and the &s;ucce&s;s confirmed, he never ventured to move.</P>
<P>When it was publi&s;hed, it was recommended by many Copies of Ver&s;es prefixed to it, among&s;t which the &s;incerity of Mr. Steele, and the genius of Eu&s;den, de&s;erve to be di&s;tingui&s;hed: But, as I would not omit any particulars relative to this renowned play, and its great author, I &s;hall in&s;ert a letter of Mr. Pope's to Sir William Turnbull, dated the 30th of April 1713, in which are &s;ome circum&s;tances that merit commemoration.</P>

This was the ca&s;e too with the Prologue writer, who was clapp'd into a &s;taunch Whig at the end of every two lines. I believe you have heard, that after all the applau&s;es of the oppo&s;ite faction, my lord Bolingbroke &s;ent for Booth, who played Cato, into the box, between one of the acts, and pre&s;ented him with fifty guineas, in acknowledgment as he expre&s;&s;ed it, for defending the cau&s;e of liberty &s;o well again&s;t a perpetual dictator. The Whigs are unwilling to be di&s;tanced this way, and therefore de&s;ign a pre&s;ent to the &s;ame Cato very &s;peedily; in the mean time, they are getting ready as good a &s;en|tence as the former on their &s;ide, &s;o betwixt them it is probable, that Cato (as Dr. Garth expre&s;t it) may have &s;omething to live upon after he dies.'</Q></P>
</LETTER>
<P>Immediately after the publication of this Tra|gedy, there came abroad a pamphlet, entitled, Ob&s;ervations on Cato; written by the ingeni|ous Dr. Sewel: The de&s;ign of this piece was to &s;hew that the applau&s;e this Tragedy met with was founded on merit. It is a very accurate and
<PB N="315" REF="318">
entertaining critici&s;m, and tends to &s;ecure the poet the hearts of his readers, as well as of his au|dience. Our author was not however without ene|mies, among&s;t whom was Mr. Dennis, who attacked it, fir&s;t in a pamphlet, and then in a &s;ub&s;equent work, in which he employed &s;even letters in pulling it to pieces: In &s;ome of his remarks he is candid, and judicious enough, in others he is trifling and ill natur'd, and I think it is pretty plain he was agitated by e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">vy; for as the intent of that play was to promote the Whig intere&s;t, of which Mr. Dennis was a zealous abettor, he could not therefore di&s;e&s;leem it from party princi|ples. Another gentleman, who called him&s;elf a &s;cholar at Oxford, con&s;idered the play in a very dif|ferent light; and endeavoured to &s;erve his party by turning the cannon upon the enemy. The title of this pamphlet is, Mr. Addi&s;on turned Tory: It is written with great &s;pirit and vivacity. Cato was &s;peedily tran&s;lated into French by Mr. Boyer, but with no &s;pirit: It was tran&s;lated likewi&s;e into Italian.</P>
<P>Voltaire has commended, and condemned Mr. Addi&s;on by turns, and in re&s;pect to Cato, he ad|mires, and cen&s;ures it extravagantly. The princi|pal character he allows &s;uperior to any before brought upon the &s;tage, but &s;ays, that all the love|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">enes are ab&s;olutely in&s;ipid: He might have added unnece&s;&s;ary, as to the plot; and the only rea&s;on that can be a&s;&s;igned for the poet's intro|ducing them was, the prevalence of cu&s;tom; but it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that his lovers are the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, and addre&s;s each other in the be&s;t language, that is to be found in any love dialogues of the Briti&s;h &s;tage: It will be difficult to find a more &s;triking line, or more picture&s;que of a lover's pa&s;&s;ion, than this pathetic exclamation; <Q><PB N="316" REF="319">A lover does not live by vulgar time.</Q></P>
<P>Queen Anne was not the la&s;t in doing ju&s;tice to our author and his performance; &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ignify an inclination of having it dedicated to her, but as he intended that compliment to another, it came into the world without any de|dication. If in the &s;ub&s;equent part of his life, his lei&s;ure had been greater, we are told, he would pro|bably have written another tragedy on the death of Socrates; but the honours accruing from what he had already performed deprived po&s;terity of that pro|duction. This &s;ubject was &s;till drier, and le&s;s &s;u&s;|ceptible of poetical ornament than the former, but in the hands of &s;o great a writer, there is no doubt but genius would have &s;upplied what was wanting in the real &s;tory, and have covered by &s;hining &s;entiments, and noble language, the &s;implicity of the plot, and deficiency in bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Upon the death of the Queen, the Lords Ju&s;tices appointed Mr. Addi&s;on their &s;ecretary. This diverted him from the de&s;ign he had formed of compo&s;ing an Engli&s;h Dictionary upon the plan of a famous Italian one: that the world has much &s;uffered by this promotion I am ready to believe, and cannot but regret that our language yet wants the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;o great a ma&s;ter, in fixing its &s;tandard, &s;ettling its purity, and illu&s;trating its copiou&s;ne&s;s, or elegance.</P>
<P>In 1716 our author married the counte&s;s of Warwick; and about that time publi&s;hed the Free|holder, which is a kind of political Spectator. This work Mr. Addi&s;on conducted without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance, upon a plan of his own forming; he
<PB N="317" REF="320">
did it in con&s;equence of his principles, out of a de&s;ire to remove prejudices, and contribute all he could to make his country happy; however it pro|duced his own promotion, in 1717, to be one of the principal &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. His health, which had been before impaired by an a&s;thmatic di&s;order, &s;uffered exceedingly by an advancement &s;o much to his honour, but attended with &s;uch great fatigue: Finding, that he was not able to manage &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s as his &s;tation led him to, he re|&s;igned, and in his lei&s;ure hours began a work of a religious nature, upon the Evidence of the Chri|&s;tian religion; which he lived not to fini&s;h. He likewi&s;e intended a Paraphra&s;e on &s;ome of the P&s;alms of David: but a long and painful relap&s;e broke all his de&s;igns, and deprived the world of one of its brighte&s;t ornaments, June 17, 1719, when he was entering the 54th year of his age. He died at Holland-hou&s;e near Ken&s;ington, and left behind him an only daughter by the counte&s;s of Warwick.</P>
<P>After his decea&s;e, Mr. Tickell, by the au|thority and direction of the author, collected, and publi&s;hed his works, in four volumes 4to. In this edition there are &s;everal pieces, as yet un|mentioned, which I &s;hall here give account of in order; the fir&s;t is a Di&s;&s;ertation upon Medals, which, though not publi&s;hed 'till after his death, was begun in 1702, when he was at Vienna.</P>
<P>In 1707 there came abroad a pamphlet, under the title of The Pre&s;ent State of the War, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of an Augmentation Con&s;idered. The Whig Examiner came out September 14 1710, for the fir&s;t time: there were five papers in all at|tributed to Mr. Addi&s;on; the&s;e are by much the tarte&s;t things he ever wrote; Dr. Sacheverel,
<PB N="318" REF="321">
Mr. Prior, and many other per&s;ons are &s;everely treated. The Exam ner had done the &s;ame thing on the part of the Tories. and the avowed de&s;ign of this paper was to make repri&s;als.</P>
<P>In the year 1713 was publi&s;hed a little pam|phlet, called The Late Trial, and Conviction of Count Tariff; it was intended to expo&s;e the Tory mini&s;try on the head of the French Commerce Bill: This is al&s;o a &s;evere piece.</P>
<P>The following have likewi&s;e been a&s;cribed to cur author;</P>

<P>A Di&s;cour&s;e on Ancient and Modern Learning; the time when it was written is uncertain, but pro|bably as early as the former. It was pre&s;erved a|mong&s;t the manu&s;cripts of lord Somers, which, after the death of Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl, being publickly &s;old, this little piece came to be printed 1739, and was well received. To the&s;e we mu&s;t add the Old Whig, No. 1 and 2. Pamphlets written in Defence of the Peerage Eill: The &s;cope of the Bill was this, that in place of 16 Peers &s;itting in Par|liament, as Repre&s;entatives of the Peerage of Scot|land, there were for the future to be twenty five hereditary Peers, by the junction of nine out of the body of the Scotch nobility, to the then 16 &s;itting Peers; that &s;ix Engli&s;h Peers &s;hould be added, and the peerage then remain fixed; the crown being re&s;trained from making any new lords, but upon the extinction of families. This gave a great
<PB N="319" REF="322">
alarm to the nation, and many papers were wrote with &s;pirit again&s;t it; among&s;t the re&s;t, one called the Plebeian, now known to have been Sir Ri|chard Steele's. In an&s;wer to this came out the Old Whig No. 1. on the State of the Peerage, with &s;ome Remarks on the Plebeian. This controver&s;y was c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rried on between the two friends, Addi&s;on and Steele, at fir&s;t without any knowledge of one another, but before it was ended, it appears, from &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions, that the author of the Old Whig was acquainted with his antagoni&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus we have gone through the mo&s;t remark|able pa&s;&s;ages of the life of this great man, in admiration of whom, it is but natural to be an Enthu&s;ia&s;t, and who&s;e very enemies expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;like with diffidence; nor indeed were his ene|mies, Mr. Pope excepted, (if it be proper to reckon Mr. Pope Mr. Addi&s;on's enemy) in one particular ca&s;e, of any con&s;equence. It is a true, and an old ob&s;ervation, that the greate&s;t men have &s;ome|times failings, that, of all other human weakne&s;&s;es, one would not &s;u&s;pect them to be &s;ubject to. It is &s;aid of Mr. Addi&s;on, that he was a &s;lave to flat|tery, that he was jealous, and &s;u&s;picious in his temper, and, as Pope keenly expre&s;&s;es it,<Q><L>Bore, like the Turk, no rival near the throne.</L></Q> That he was jealous of the fame of Pope, many have believed, and perhaps not altogether without ground. He preferred Tickel's tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t Book of Homer, to Pope's. His words are, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'the other has more of Homer,'</Q> when, at the &s;ame time, in a letter to Pope, he &s;trenuou&s;ly advi&s;es him to undertake it, and tells him, there is none but he equal to it; which circum&s;tance has made &s;ome
<PB N="320" REF="323">
people conjecture, that Addi&s;on was him&s;elf the author of the tran&s;lation, imputed to Mr. Tickell: Be this as it may, it is unplea&s;ing to dwell upon the failings, and quarrels of great men; let us rather draw a veil over all their errors, and only admire their virtues, and their genius; of both which the author, the incidents of who&s;e life we have now been tracing, had a large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He added much to the purity of the Engli&s;h &s;tile in pro&s;e; his rhime is not &s;o flowing, nervous, or manly as &s;ome of his cotemporaries, but his pro&s;e has an original excellence, a &s;moothne&s;s and dignity peculiar to it. His poetry, as well as &s;en|timents, in Cato, cannot be prai&s;ed enough.</P>
<P>Mr. Addi&s;on was &s;tedfa&s;t to his principles, faith|ful to his friends, a zealous patriot, honourable in public &s;tations, amiable in private life, and as he lived, he died, a good man, and a pious Chri&s;tian.</P>

<HEAD>ANNE, Counte&s;s of WINCHELSEA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS lady, de&s;ervedly celebrated for her po|etic genius, was daughter of Sir William King&s;mill of Sidmonton, in the county of South|ampton. She was Maid of Honour to the Duche&s;s of York, &s;econd wife to King James II. and was afterwards married to Heneage earl of Winchel|&s;ea, who was in his father's life-time Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to the Duke of York.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of this lady's poems, is that upon the Spleen, publi&s;hed by Mr. Charles Gildon, 1701, in 8vo. That poem oc|ca&s;ioned another of Mr. Nicholas Rowe's, entitled an Epi&s;tle to Flavia, on the &s;ight of two Pindaric Odes on the Spleen and Vanity, written by a Lady to her Friend. This poem of the Spleen is writ|ten in &s;tanzas, after the manner of Cowley, and contains many thoughts naturally expre&s;&s;ed, and poetically conceived; there is &s;eldom to be found any thing more excellently picture&s;que than this poem, and it ju&s;tly entitles the amiable counte&s;s to hold a very high &s;tation among&s;t the in&s;pired tribe.

<HEAD>CHARLES GILDON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman was born at Gillingham near Shaft&s;hury, in the county of Dor&s;et. His parents, and family were all of the Romi&s;h per&s;ua&s;ion, but they could not in&s;til their principles into our author, who, as &s;oon as he began to rea&s;on, was able to di&s;cover the errors, and foppery of that church. His father was a member of the &s;ociety of Grays-Inn, and &s;uf|fered much for the Royal cau&s;e. The fir&s;t rudi|ments of learning Mr. Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">don had at the place of his nativity; thence his relations &s;ent him to the Engli&s;h college of &s;ecular prie&s;ts at Doway in Hainault, with a de&s;ign of making him a prie&s;t; but after five years &s;tudy there, he found his incli|nation direct him to a quite different cour&s;e of life. When he was nineteen years old he returned to England, and as &s;oon as he was of age, and ca|pable of enjoying the plea&s;ures of gaiety, he came to Londos, where he &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his paternal e&s;tate. At about the age of twenty|three, to crown his other imprudences, he married, without improving his reduced circum&s;tances thereby.</P>
<P>During the reign of King James II. he dedi|cated his time to the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">dy of the prevailing con|trover&s;ies, and he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">mewhere declares, it co&s;t him above &s;even years clo&s;e application to books, be|fore he could entirely overcome the prejudices of his education.

tenets of the church of Rome; nor could he em|brace the ridiculous doctrine of her infallibility: But as he had been taught an early reverence to the prie&s;thood, and a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive obedience to their authority, it was a long while before he a&s;&s;umed courage to think freely for him&s;elf, or declare what he thought.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t attempt in the drama, was not till he had arrived at his 32d year; and he him&s;elf in his e&s;&s;ays tells us, that nece&s;&s;ity (the general induce|ment) was his fir&s;t motive of venturing to be an author.</P>
<P>He is the author of three plays, viz.<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Roman Bride's Revenge, a Tragedy; acted at the Theatre-Royal 1697. This play was written in a month, and had the u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s of ha&s;ty productions, though the fir&s;t and &s;econd acts are well written, and the cata&s;trophe beautiful; the moral being to give us an example, in the puni&s;h|ment of Martian, that no con&s;ideration ought to make us delay the &s;ervice of our country.</ITEM>

Phaeton, or the Fatal Divorce; a Tragedy, acted at the Theatre-Royal 1698, dedicated to Charles Montague, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> This play is written in imitation of the ancients, with &s;ome reflexions on a book called a Short View of the Immorality of the Engli&s;h Stage, written by Mr. Collier, a Non|juring Clergyman, who combated in the cau&s;e of virtue, with &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t Dryden, Congreve, Dennis, and our author. The plot of this play, and a great many of the beauties, Mr. Gildon owns in his preface, he has taken from the Medea of Euripides.</ITEM>

He introduced the Play called the Younger Bro|ther, or the Amorous Jilt; written by Mrs. Behn, but not brought upon the &s;tage 'till after her de|cea&s;e. He made very little alteration in it.

<HEAD>THOMAS D'URFEY,</HEAD>
<P>WAS born in the county of Devon, and was fir&s;t bred to the law; but we have not heard from what &s;amily he was de&s;cended, nor in what year he was born. He has written upwards of thirty plays, with various &s;ucce&s;s, but had a genius better turned to a ballad, and little irregu|lar odes, than for dramatic poetry. He &s;oon for|&s;ook the pro&s;e&s;&s;ion of the law, and threw him&s;elf upon the public, by writing for the &s;tage.&mdash;That D'Urfey was a man of &s;ome abilities, and enjoyed the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of men of the greate&s;t parts in his time, appears from the favourable te&s;timony of the author of the Guardian: And as the de&s;ign of this work is to collect, and throw into one view, whatever may be found concerning any poet of eminence in various books, and literary records, we &s;hall make no &s;cru|ple of tran&s;cribing what that ingenious writer has humorou&s;ly &s;aid concerning our author.</P>

It is my opinion, that the above pills would be extremely proper to be taken with A&s;&s;es milk, and might contribute towards the renewing and re&s;toring decayed lungs.'</Q></P>
<P>Numb. 67. He thus &s;peaks of his old friend.&mdash;<Q REND="inline">'It has been remarked, by curious ob&s;ervers, that poets are generally long lived, and run beyond the u&s;ual age of man, if not cut off by &s;ome accident, or exce&s;s, as Anacreon, in the mid&s;t of a very merry old age, was choaked with a grape &s;tone. The &s;ame redundancy of &s;pirits that produces the poetical flame, keeps up the vital warmth, and ad|mini&s;ters uncommon fuel to life. I que&s;tion not but &s;everal in&s;tances will occur to my reader's me|mory, from Homer down to Mr. Dryden; I &s;hall only take notice of two who have excelled in Lyrics, the one an antient, the other a modern. The fir&s;t gained an immortal reputation by celebrating &s;eve|ral jockeys in the Olympic Games; the la&s;t has &s;ignalized him&s;elf on the &s;ame occa&s;ion, by the Ode that begins with&mdash;To hor&s;e brave boys, to New-market, to hor&s;e. The reader will by this time know, that the two poets I have mentioned are Pindar, and Mr. D'Urfey. The former of the&s;e is long &s;ince laid in his urn, after having many years together endeared him&s;elf to all Greece, by his tune|ful compo&s;itions.

think it de&s;erves a place among the fine&s;t of tho&s;e works, with which he obliged the world in his more early years.<P>'I am led into this &s;ubject, by a vi&s;it which I lately received from my good old friend and cotem|porary. As we both flouri&s;hed together in king Charles the IId's reign, we diverted our&s;elves with the remembrance of &s;everal particulars that pa&s;s'd in the world, before the greate&s;t part of my readers were born; and could not but &s;mile to think how in&s;en&s;ibly we were grown into a couple of venerable old gentlemen. Tom ob&s;erved to me, that after having written more Odes than Horace, and about four times as many Comedies as Terence; he was reduced to great difficulties, by the importunities of a &s;et of men, who of late years had furni&s;hed him with the acccommodations of life, and would not, as we &s;ay, be paid with a &s;ong. In order to ex|tricate my old friend, I immediately &s;ent for the three directors of the Play-hou&s;e, and de&s;ired they would in their turn, do a good office for a man, who in Shake&s;pear's phra&s;e, often filled their mouths; I mean with plea&s;antry and popular conceits. They very generou&s;ly li&s;tened to my propo&s;al, and agreed to act the Plotting Si&s;ters (a very taking play of my old friends compo&s;ing) on the 15th of next month, for the benefit of the author.</P>
<P>'My kindne&s;s to the agreeable Mr. D'Urfey, will be imperfect, if, after having engaged the players in his favour, I do not get the town to come into it. I mu&s;t therefore heartily recommend to all the young ladies my di&s;ciples, the ca&s;e of my old friend, who has often made their grand-mothers merry; and who&s;e Sonnets have perhaps lulled a&s;leep many a pre&s;ent toa&s;t, when &s;he lay in her cradle. The gentleman I am &s;peaking of, has laid obligations on &s;o many of his countrymen, that I
<PB N="334" REF="337">
hope they will think this but a ju&s;t return to the good &s;ervice of a vet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ran Poet.</P>
<P>'I my&s;elf, remember king Charles the IId. lean|ing on Tom D'Urfey's &s;houlder more than once, and humming over a &s;ong with him. It is certain, that monarch was not a little &s;upported, by joy to great Cae&s;ar; which gave the Whigs &s;uch a blow, as they were not able to recover that whole reign. My friend afterwards attacked Popery, with the &s;ame &s;acce&s;s, having expo&s;ed Bel armine, and Porto|carero, more than once, in &s;hort &s;atirical compo|&s;itions, which have been in every body's mouth. He made u&s;e of Italian Tunes and Sonato's, for promoting the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t; and turned a con&s;iderable part of the Pope's mu&s;ic again&s;t him|&s;elf. In &s;hort, he has obliged the court with poli|tical S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nnets; the country with Dialogues, and Pa&s;torals; the city with De&s;criptions of a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">d Mayor's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;t; not to mention his little Ode upon Stool-Ball; with many others of the like nature.</P>
<P>'Should the very individuals he has celebrated, make their appearance together, they would be &s;ufficient to fill the play-hou&s;e. Pretty Peg of Wind&s;or, Gilian of Croydon; with Dolly and Molly; and Tommy and Johny; with many others to be met with in the mu&s;ical Mi&s;cellanies, would make a great benefit.</P>
<P>'As my friend, after the manner of the old Lyrics, accompanies his works with his own voice; he has been the delight of the mo&s;t polite companies and conver&s;ations, from the beginning of king Charles the IId's reign, to our own times: Many an hone&s;t gentleman has got a reputation in his country, by pretending to have been in company with Tom D'Urfey.</P>
<P>'I might here mention &s;everal other merits in my friend, as his enriching our langauge with a multi|tade of rhimes, and bringing words together, that without his good offices, would never have been

acquainted with one another, &s;o long as it had been a tongue; but I mu&s;t not omit that my old friend angled for a trout, the be&s;t of any man in England.</P>
<P>'After what I have &s;aid, and much more that I might &s;ay, on this &s;ubject, I que&s;tion not but the world will think that my old friend ought not to pa&s;s the remainder of his life in a cage, like a &s;inging bird; but enjoy all that Pindaric liberty, which is &s;uitable to a man of his genius. He has made the world merry, and I hope they will make him ea&s;y, as long as he &s;tays among&s;t us. This I will take upon me to &s;ay, they cannot do a kindne&s;s, to a more diverting companion, or a more chearful, hone&s;t, good-natur'd man.'&mdash;</P></Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame author, Numb. 82. puts his readers in mind when D Urfey's benefit came on, of &s;ome other circum&s;tances favourable to him. <Q REND="inline">'The Plotting Si&s;ters, &s;ays he, is this day to be acted for the be|nefit of the author, my old friend Mr. D'Urfey. This comedy was honoured with the pre&s;ence of King Charles II. three of the fir&s;t five nights. My friend has in this work &s;hewn him&s;elf a ma&s;ter, and made not only the characters of the play, but al|&s;o the furniture of the hou&s;e contribute to the main de&s;ign. He has made excellent u&s;e of a table with a carpet, and the key of a clo&s;et; with the&s;e two implements, which would perhaps have been over|looked by an ordinary writer, he contrives the mo&s;t natural perplexities (allowing only the u&s;e of the&s;e hou&s;hold goods in poetry) that ever were repre|&s;ented on a &s;tage. He al&s;o made good advantage of the knowledge of the &s;tage it&s;elf; for in the nick of being &s;urprized, the lovers are let down, and e&s;cape at a trap door. In a word, any who have the curio&s;ity to ob&s;erve what plea&s;ed in the la&s;t generation, and does not go to a comedy with a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;olution to be grave, will find this evening am|ple

The ingenious Mr. Pinkethman is a ba&s;hful rake, and is &s;heepi&s;h, without having mode&s;ty with great &s;uc|ce&s;s. Mr. Bullock &s;ucceeds Nokes in the part of Bubble, and, in my opinion, is not much below him, for he does excellently that kind of folly we call ab&s;urdity, which is the very contrary of wit; but next to that is, of all things, propere&s;t to ex|cite mirth. What is fooli&s;h is the object of pity, but ab&s;urdity often proceeds from an op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">nion of &s;ufficiency, and con&s;equently is an hone&s;t occa&s;ion for laughter. The&s;e characters in this play, can|not but make it a very plea&s;ant entertainment, and the decorations of &s;inging and dancing, will more than repay the good-nature of tho&s;e, who make an hone&s;t man a vi&s;it of two merry hours, to make his following year unpainful.'</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e are the te&s;timonies of friend&s;hip and e|&s;teem, which this great author has given in favour of D'Urfey, and however his genius may be turned for the Sing-&s;ong, or Ballad, which is certainly the lowe&s;t &s;pecies of poetry, yet that man cannot be termed contemptible, who was thus loved, and, though in jocular terms, prai&s;ed by Mr. Addi&s;on.</P>
<P>There are few, or no particulars relating to the life of this poet pre&s;erved. He was attached to the Tory intere&s;t, and in the latter part of Queen Anne's reign frequently had the honour of di|verting her with witty catches, and &s;ongs of hu|mour &s;uited to the &s;pirit of the times. He died, according to Mr. Coxeter, February 26, 1723, in a good old age, and was buried in the Church-yard of St. James's, We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>ELKANAH SETTLE,</HEAD>
<P>SON of Jo&s;eph Settle of Dun&s;table in Bedford|&s;hire, was born there; and in the 18th year of his age, 1666, was entered commoner of Trinity College, Oxon, and put under the tuition of Mr. Abraham Champion, fellow of that hou&s;e; but he quitted the univer&s;ity without taking any degree, and came to London<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wood's Athen. Oxon. vol. ii. p. 1076.</NOTE>, where he addicted him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of poetry, in which he lived to make no incon&s;iderable figure. Finding the nation divided between the opinions of Whig and Tory, and being &s;en&s;ible that a man of parts could not make any con&s;iderable figure, unle&s;s he attached him&s;elf to one of the&s;e parties; Settle thought pro|per, on his fir&s;t &s;etting out in life, to join the Whigs, who were then, though the minor, yet a powerful party, and to &s;upport who&s;e intere&s;t he employed his talents.</P>
<P>About the year 1680, when the debates ran high concerning the exclu&s;ion of the Duke of York from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, on account of his religious princi|ples, our author wrote a piece called the Character of a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or, and what may be expected from &s;uch an one, humbly offered to the con&s;idera|tion of both the Hou&s;es of Parliament appointed to meet at Oxon, on March 21, 1681. This e&s;&s;ay it &s;eems was thought of con&s;equence enough to merit an an&s;wer, as at that time the Exclu&s;ion Bill employed the general conver&s;ation. The an|&s;wer
<PB N="346" REF="349">
to it was entitled The Character of a Re|bellion, and what England may expect from One; printed 1682. The author of this la&s;t piece, is ve|ry &s;evere on the character of Settle; he repre&s;ents him as an errant knave, a de&s;picable coward, and a prophane Athei&s;t, and &s;eems amazed that any par|ty &s;hould make choice of a champion, who&s;e mo|rals were &s;o tainted; but as this is only the lan|guage of party violence, no great credit is to be given to it.</P>
<P>The author of this pamphlet carries his zeal, and ill manners &s;till further, and informs the world of the meanne&s;s of our author's birth, and education, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'mo&s;t of his relations (&s;ays he) are Barbers, and of the ba&s;ene&s;s, fal&s;ene&s;s, and mutability of his nature, too many evidences may be brought. He clo&s;ed with the Whigs, contrary to the principles he formerly profe&s;&s;ed, at a time when they took occa&s;ion to pu&s;h their cau&s;e, upon the breaking out of Oates's plot, and was ready to fall off from, and return to them, for his own advantage.'</Q></P>
<P>To the abovementioned pamphlet, written by Set|tle, various other an&s;wers were publi&s;hed, &s;ome by writers of di&s;tinction, of which Sir Roger L'E&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ange was one; and to this performance of Sir Roger's, which was entitled The Character of a Papi&s;t in Ma&s;que|rade, &s;upported by Authority and Experience, Mr Settle made a Reply, entited The Character of a Popi&s;h Succe&s;&s;or Compleat; this, in the opinion of the critics, is the &s;marte&s;t piece ever written upon the &s;ubject of the Exclu&s;ion Bill, and yet Sir Roger, his antagoni&s;t, <Q REND="inline margSglQuotes">'calls it a pompous, wordy thing, made up of &s;hifts, and &s;uppo&s;itions, without &s;o much as an argument, either offered, or an&s;wered in &s;tre&s;s of the que&s;tion, &amp;c.'</Q> Mr. Settle's cau&s;e was &s;o much better than that of his antagoni&s;t's, that if he had not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed half the powers he really did, he mu&s;t have come off the conqueror, for,
<PB N="347" REF="350">
who does not &s;ee the immediate danger, the fatal chances, to which a Prote&s;tant people are expo&s;ed, who have the misfortune to be governed by a Popi&s;h Prince. As the King is naturally powerful, he can ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;e of the places of importance, and tru&s;t, &s;o as to have them filled with creatures of his own, who will engage in any enterprize, or pervert any law, to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of the reign|ing Monarch. Had not the nation an in&s;tance of this, during the &s;hort reign of the very Popi&s;h Prince, again&s;t whom Settle contended? Did not judge Jeffries, a name ju&s;tly devoted to everla&s;ting infa|my, corrupt the &s;treams of ju&s;tice, and by the mo&s;t audacious cruelty, pervert the forms of law, that the blood of innocent per&s;ons might be &s;hed, to gratify the appetite of a &s;u&s;picious ma&s;ter? Be&s;ides, there is always a danger that the religion which the King profe&s;&s;es, will imperceptibly diffu&s;e it&s;elf over a nation, though no violence is u&s;ed to pro|mote it. The King, as he is the fountain of ho|nour, &s;o is he the fountain of fa&s;hion, and as ma|ny people, who &s;urround a throne, are of no reli|gion in con&s;equence of conviction; it is but na|tural to &s;uppo&s;e, that fa&s;hion would influence them to embrace the religion of the Prince, and in James II's reign, this ob&s;ervation was verified; for the people of fa&s;hion embraced the Popi&s;h re|ligion &s;o very fa&s;t, in order to plea&s;e the King, that a witty knight, who then lived, and who was by his education, and principles, a Papi&s;t, being asked by a nobleman what news? he made an&s;wer, I hear no news my lord, only, God's Papi&s;ts can get no preferment, becau&s;e the King's Papi&s;ts &s;warm &s;o thick. This was a &s;ententious, and witty ob|&s;ervation, and it will always hold true, that the re|ligion of the King will become the religion of people of fa&s;hion, and the lower &s;tations ape their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>Upon the coronation of King James II. the two Parts of the Character of a Popi&s;h Succe&s;|&s;or,
<PB N="348" REF="351">
were, with the Exclu&s;ion Bill, on the 23d of April, 1685, burnt by the &s;ub-wardens, and fellows of Merton College, Oxon, in a public bonfire, made in the middle of their great qua|drangle. During the&s;e contentions, Mr. Settle al|&s;o publi&s;hed a piece called The Medal Revers'd, publi&s;hed 1681; this was an an&s;wer to a poem of Dryden's called The Medal, occa&s;ioned by the bill again&s;t the earl of Shaft&s;bury being found ignora|mus at the Old Baily, upon which the Whig par|ty made bonfires, and ordered a medal to be &s;truck in commemoration of that event. Shaft&s;bury, who was by his principles a Whig, and who could not but fore&s;ee the mi&s;eries which afterwards happen|ed under a Popi&s;h Prince, oppo&s;ed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion with all his power; he was a man of very great endowments, and being of a bu&s;tling tumultuous di&s;po&s;ition, was admirably fitted to be the head of a party. He was the leading man again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Duke of York, and argued in the Hou&s;e of Lords with great force again&s;t him, and what was more remarkable, &s;ometimes in the Duke's pre&s;ence. It is related, that at the Council-table, when his Maje&s;ty, and his Royal Brother were both pre&s;ent, &s;omething concerning the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was canva&s;&s;ed, when Shaft&s;bury, not in the lea&s;t intimidated, &s;poke his opinion with great vehe|mence again&s;t the Duke, and was an&s;wered with equal heat, but with le&s;s force, by the then lord chamberlain. During this debate, the Duke took occa&s;ion to whi&s;per the King, that his Maje&s;ty had a villain of a chancellor, to which the King mer|rily replied, oddsfi&s;h, York, what a fool you have of a chamberlain: by which it appears, his Ma|je&s;ty was convinced that Shaft&s;bury's arguments were the &s;tronge&s;t.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of Shaft&s;bury's violent oppo&s;ition to the Duke, and the court party, there was a Bill of Indictment of High Trea&s;on, read before his
<PB N="349" REF="352">
Maje&s;ty's Commi&s;&s;ioners of Oyer and Terminer in the Se&s;&s;ions-Hou&s;e at the Old Bailey, but the Ju|ry found it Ignoramus; upon which, all the party rejoiced at the deliverance of their head. The&s;e di&s;turbances gave Mr. Settle an opportunity to di&s;play his abilities, which he did not neglect to improve, by which means he procured &s;o formida|ble an antagoni&s;t as Mr. Dryden, who was obliged by his place of laureat, to &s;peak, and write for the court. Dryden had formerly joined Mr. Set|tle, in order to reduce the growing reputation of Shadwell, but their intere&s;t being now &s;o oppo&s;ite, they became poetical enemies, in which Settle was, no doubt, over-matched. He wrote a poem, how|ever, called Azaria and Hu&s;hai, in five &s;heets, 4to. de&s;igned as an an&s;wer to Mr. Dryden's poem called Ab&s;alom and Achitophel.</P>
<P>Soon after this, if we may credit the Oxford Antiquary, Settle changed &s;ides, and turned Tory, with as much violence as he had formerly e&s;pou&s;ed the intere&s;t of the Whigs. He publi&s;hed in 1683, in eight &s;heets in folio, a Narrative; the fir&s;t part of which is concerning him&s;elf, as being of the Tory &s;ide; the &s;econd to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency, and contradiction of Titus Oates's Narrative of the Plot of the Popi&s;h Party, again&s;t the Life of King Charles II. at the time when that Monarch intend|ed to alter his mini&s;try, to have con&s;ented to the exclu&s;ion of his brother, and taken mea&s;ures to &s;up|port the Prote&s;tant intere&s;t. This Oates was in the reign of James II. tried, and convicted of per|jury, upon the evidence chiefly of Papi&s;ts, and had a &s;evere &s;entence pronounced, and inflicted upon him, viz. Impri&s;onment for life, twice every year to &s;tand on the pillory, and twice to be &s;everely, whipt; but he received a pardon from King William, after &s;uffering his whippings, and two years im|pri&s;onment, with amazing fortitude, but was never allowed again to be an evidence.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="353">
While Settle was engaged in the Tory party, he is &s;aid, by Wood, to have been author of Animad|ver&s;ions on the La&s;t Speech and Confe&s;&s;ion of Wil|liam Lord Ru&s;&s;el, who fell a &s;acrifice to the Duke of York, and who&s;e &s;tory, as related by Burnet, never fails to move the reader to tears. Al&s;o Re|marks on Algernon Sidney's Paper, delivered to the Sheriffs at his Execution, London, 1683, in one &s;heet, publi&s;hed the la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">er end of December the &s;ame year. Algernon Sidney was likewi&s;e mur|dered by the &s;ame kind of violence, which popi&s;h bigotry had lifted up again&s;t the lives of &s;ome other Briti&s;h worthies.</P>
<P>He al&s;o wrote a heroic poem on the Coronation of the High and Mighty Monarch James II. Lon|don 1685, and then commenced a Journali&s;t for the Court, and publi&s;hed weekly an E&s;&s;ay in behalf of the Admini&s;tration. If Settle was capable of the&s;e mean compliances of writing for, or again&s;t a party, as he was hired, he mu&s;t have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very fordid mind, and been totally devoid of all principles of honour; but as there is no other au|thority for it than Wood, who is enthu&s;ia&s;tic in his temper, and often writes of things, not as they were, but as he would wi&s;h them to be, the read|er may give what credit he plea&s;es to the report.</P>

<P>Our poet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a pen&s;ion from the City Ma|gi&s;trates, for an annual Panegyric to celebrate the Fe&s;tival of the Lord Mayor, and in con&s;equence wrote various poems, which he calls Triumphs for the Inauguration of the Lord Mayors, which are pre&s;erved in his works, and which it would be needle&s;s to enumerate. Be&s;ides his dramatic pieces, he publi&s;hed many occa&s;ional poems, addre&s;&s;ed to his patrons, and &s;ome funeral elegies on the deaths of his friends. It is certain Settle did not want learning, and, in the opinion of &s;ome critics, in the early part of his life, &s;ometimes excelled Dry|den; but that was certainly owing more to a pow|er he had of keeping his temper unruffled, than any effort of genius; for between Dryden and Settle, there is as great difference, as between our modern ver&s;ifiers, and Pope.</P>
<P>Whatever was the &s;ucce&s;s of his poetry, he was the

be&s;t contriver of machinery in England, and for ma|ny years of the latter part of his life received an an|nual &s;alary from Mrs. Minns, and her daughter Mrs. Leigh, for writing Drolls for Bartholomew, and Southwark Fairs, with proper decorations. which were generally &s;o well cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ived, that they exceeded tho&s;e of their opponents in the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our author died in the Charterhou&s;e 1734; &s;ome months before his decea&s;e, he offered a play to the managers of the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, but he lived not to introduce it on the &s;tage; it was called The Expul&s;ion of the Danes from Britain.</P>
