<HEAD>BOOK V. FROM THE BIRTH OF SHAKESPEAR TO THE DEATH OF ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. STATE OF THE STAGE THROUGHOUT EUROPE AT THE BIRTH OF SHAKESPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>THERE cannot be a clearer truth than that the &s;tage knew nothing of &s;uperior merit, in tragedy, from EURIPIDES, and, in comedy, from MENAN|DER, till SHAKESPEAR. ROME imitated but did not invent, ITALY faintly copied the Romans imi|tations, SPAIN &s;ketched but could not paint, and FRANCE traced but could not draw. ENGLAND, continually fluctuating under the influence of va|rious fortunes, as cu&s;toms, manners, and circum|&s;tances prevailed, adopted the &s;tyle of other coun|tries,
<PB N="6" REF="4">
and added to theirs no mean degree of native genius; but the efforts were merely THESPIAN and required an AESCHYLUS to perfect them.</P>
<P>At the birth of SHAKESPEAR, ITALY had fairly &s;truggled with ENGLAND for pre-eminence in the dramatic art for nearly fifty years; and it cannot be denied that the oppo&s;ition was very formidable as to talents; for, during the life of LEO the tenth, which &s;ome of the critics have di&s;tingui&s;hed by the pomp|ous title of the Italian Augu&s;tan Age, led on by the prelate TRISSINO, and the cardinal BIBIENA, almo&s;t the whole of that groop of authors who were pa|tronized by LAURENCE of MEDICIS, joined their united labours again&s;t BUCKHURST, STILL, and other authors who followed HEYWOOD; and who, by their ingenious and meritorious labours gave the Engli&s;h theatre the fir&s;t lift towards regularity.</P>
<P>The reader by this &s;tatement will at fir&s;t &s;ight unequivocally decide in favour of ITALY; for when we reflect on the extraordinary merit of the great TASSO, who&s;e <HI>Rinaldo</HI> has been the admi|ration, and his <HI>Aminta</HI> the delight of the critics; who&s;e <HI>Gieru&s;alemme Liberata</HI> has been pronounced by many writers of ta&s;te to be the complete&s;t epic poem that ever graced literature; and who, as a phi|lo&s;opher, an orator, a logician, a critic, and a poet
<PB N="7" REF="5">
has merited and obtained the warme&s;t prai&s;e from the &s;obere&s;t and be&s;t informed judges.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the genius and fire of the wonderful ARIOSTO, who&s;e <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o</HI> alone has rai&s;ed to him a monument of fame on which every admirer of luxuriant fancy and extraordinary &s;trength of mind have, in their warm and &s;ponta|neous admiration, added an ornamental laurel; in &s;hort, when we con&s;ider that the&s;e and various other eminent authors, who&s;e abilities were indi&s;putably competent to carry the dramatic art into complete perfection, even at that period were not only the admiration of EUROPE, but candidates for dramatic fame, it &s;hould appear even ab&s;urd to put the En|gli&s;h &s;tage in competition with the Italian.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, can be truer than that, upon a compari&s;on, the Italian drama &s;unk to annihilation by the &s;ide of the Engli&s;h; for, whether the&s;e great authors wrote for the &s;tage merely to gratify an ec|centric propen&s;ity, though it is extremely difficult to conceive how a writer of great genius can feel indifferently while employed &s;o eligibly, or whether they wrote extravagantly, ridiculou&s;ly, and ab|&s;urdly, to gratify an extravagant, a ridiculous, and an ab&s;urd ta&s;te; it is unequivocally certain that the Italian theatre con&s;i&s;ted of nothing but the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="6">
buffoonery, and &s;unk into gradual contempt, while the Engli&s;h theatre began at that time to grow re|fined, and very &s;oon gave vi&s;ible &s;igns of its attain|ing that perfection of which it was capable, and to which it was regularly ha&s;tening.</P>
<P>One great rea&s;on for the decline of the Italian theatre was its &s;hocking impiety; for it never ad|mitted of merely profane &s;ubjects, except in operas, which certainly are the only &s;pecies of dramatic amu&s;ement in that country worthy attention; and even the&s;e were by no means perfect in their na|ture till early in the pre&s;ent century, when they found a kind of SHAKESPEAR in METASTASIO.</P>
<P>As to SPAIN, the theatre never, even to this mo|ment, boa&s;ted any thing like regularity; &s;pight of the a&s;toni&s;hingly fertile genius manife&s;ted in the multitudinous productions of the mo&s;t celebrated authors of that country. In SPAIN, as in ITALY, this may be accounted for by in&s;tancing the horrid impiety introduced into their <HI>Autos Sacramentales</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In one of the&s;e &s;trange pieces the audience are treated with the pro&s;pect of a church on fire. A knight is pre&s;ently di&s;covered, who, full of devotion, ru&s;hes into the flames, and at length, having re&s;cued the ho&s;t from the conflagration, which ought, by the bye, to be invulnerable, returns with it &s;afe and &s;ound in his hand; upon which the re&s;t of the actors accompany him in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ndango.</NOTE>,
<PB N="9" REF="7">
which in its place I have already given &s;ome ac|count of.</P>
<P>Small pieces, however, called <HI>Entreme&s;&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Jornados,</HI> evidently the &s;irventes and ten&s;ons of PRO|VENCE, and the ancient interludes of ENGLAND, were performed by a few actors, and appear to have been more like regular farces than tho&s;e exhibited in any other country at &s;o early a period. The&s;e, neverthele&s;s, were &s;oon on the decline, and when they were attempted again at the time of CAL|DERON, they were the mo&s;t wretched tra&s;h that can be imagined.</P>
<P>The&s;e trifles, however, &s;erved for the ground work of a better &s;ort of performances; for much about the time of HEYWOOD, they grew into &s;ome|thing more con&s;iderable, till LOPEZ de RUEDA, and NAVARA, &s;hortly after the birth of SHAKES|PEAR, began to &s;hape them into acts and give them a preci&s;e length. But the&s;e, though they were followed by CERVANTES, who&s;e <HI>Don Quixotte</HI> has immortalized him, and LOPEZ de VEGA with his fifteen hundred plays, both of whom were cotem|porary with SHAKESPEAR, never were able, even if we add to theirs the labours of CALDERON, SOLIS, SALAZAR, MOLINA, and many others to
<PB N="10" REF="8">
bring the Spani&s;h &s;tage to any thing better than the re&s;emblance of a crouded garden, overrun with weeds and inter&s;per&s;ed here and there with flowers of rare and peculiar beauty.</P>
<P>The German theatre, not as I have mixed it be|fore with the Dutch, but properly that theatre e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the principal cities of the empire, boa&s;ts a very early origin, a truth which may &s;erve to &s;trengthen tho&s;e conjectures which have been ven|tured concerning the antiquity of the Engli&s;h &s;tage.</P>
<P>Ancient GERMANY had its bards, doubtle&s;s the Druids, who compo&s;ed and &s;ung in honour of their heroes; and the&s;e are to be traced from a very early period till CHARLEMAGNE. They then began to exerci&s;e their profe&s;&s;ion more decidedly, and were called <HI>Ma&s;ter-Langer,</HI> or Ma&s;ter-Singers. The&s;e were protected by various monarchs; and, in particular, received great encouragement from OTHO the Great, and MAXIMILIAN the Fir&s;t.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this di&s;tingui&s;hed counte|nance, they grew more and more celebrated; and pre&s;ently MENTZ, STRASBOURG, NUREMBOURG, AUGSBOURG, and other cities boa&s;ted their different &s;ocieties of ma&s;ter-&s;ingers, who attended at tourna|ments, public meetings, and other &s;olemn ceremo|nies.
<PB N="11" REF="9">
Not long ago the &s;ociety of STRASBOURG was in exi&s;tence and enjoyed certain revenues, e&s;tabli&s;hed many ages in favour of that company, which was compo&s;ed of trade&s;men, &s;uch as taylors, &s;hoemakers, millers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus in the&s;e &s;ocieties of ma&s;ter-&s;ingers we have, not only, in the cleare&s;t manner, the troubadours and trouverres of PROVENCE; but in the &s;ociety of STRASBOURG we have the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the min|&s;trels of CHESTER. We find nothing, however, very celebrated in their productions, nor, till about the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, worth notice; at that time one HAANSSAHCS, who had by no means a de&s;picable genius, wrote &s;ome dramatic pieces in which he performed him&s;elf; but they are, like the pieces of other countries, taken from &s;acred hi&s;tory, and, therefore, cannot rank as repre|&s;entations of common manners.</P>
<P>The German theatre, however, was not al&s;o without pieces on profane &s;ubjects, and the authors of the&s;e, joined at length by HAANSSACHS, like the Children of Sans Souci in FRANCE, and the in|terluders in ENGLAND, began to prepare the theatre for the reception of regular tragedies and comedies.</P>
<P>This event, however, did not take place &s;o &s;oon
<PB N="12" REF="10">
as in ENGLAND, or in FRANCE; for the German regular theatre owes its origin to the Dutch, and the reader will remember that they had no theatre them&s;elves till 1584. In the year 1626, a com|pany of Dutch players went to HAMBOURG, and from that moment the German theatre altered its manner. The ma&s;ter-&s;ingers were &s;oon routed, a regular company of German actors turned them into contempt and ridicule, from this company &s;prung &s;everal others; and, having the example of ENGLAND, and by this time FRANCE before them, their poets wrote regular tragedies and comedies in tolerably correct ver&s;e.</P>
<P>The German tragedies and comedies, however, even to this hour, are clogged with the heavine&s;s and gloom of the Dutch, of which they were origin|ally imitations. Horrible noi&s;es, bloody &s;words, &s;pecties, flaming torches, magic hands, tombs, dun|geons, racks, and every other &s;ubject to excite terror, pervade their tragedies, one would think to divert the auditor from either &s;leeping or venting his indignation at their intolerable dullne&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus the only nation that held out the &s;hadow of a pretention to dramatic fame, even up to the time when SHAKESPEAR produced his fir&s;t play, was FRANCE. There, indeed, appeared a dawn of
<PB N="13" REF="11">
&s;omething like regularity, but it was cold, tame, and ob&s;cure; being a Greek and Roman mixture im|proved by ingredients taken from the Engli&s;h, who had been at the &s;ource before them.</P>
<P>LAZARE BAIF, and JODELLE, were the only authors of any con&s;ideration who wrote before SHAKESPEAR; GARNIER being his &s;ole rival during the fir&s;t half of his career, and HARDY during the la&s;t, for the great CORNEILLE did not bring out a &s;ingle play till nine years after the death of our immortal poet, by which time the united la|bours of SHAKESPEAR, JONSON, BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, MASSINGER, RANDOLPH, and the other authors of that time comprizing a ma&s;s of dra|matic excellence, &s;uch as no age nor country has ever produced, pa&s;&s;ed in review before Engli&s;h &s;pectators.</P>
<P>What then &s;hall we &s;ay of the French, who in the &s;ame breath boa&s;t of having taught ENGLAND the dramatic art, and call CORNEILLE the father of the &s;tage and &s;ucce&s;&s;or of AESCHYLUS, who in point of years might have been SHAKESPEAR's grand&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. SHAKESPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>GREAT and extraordinary objects naturally attract univer&s;al attention; unfortunately, however, human nature is compo&s;ed of &s;uch various and complicate materials, that it is extremely difficult in any ca&s;e to lift this attention into admiration. The &s;un that cheers and invigorates us, is a perpetual object of reproach. We feign to &s;ink under tho&s;e very rays that di&s;pel the mi&s;ts of contagion, that &s;weeten the provender for our cattle, that ripen the fruits which pamper our luxury, and that whiten the corn which compo&s;es our daily bread. We overlook the beauty, the maje&s;ty, the &s;plendor which &s;avages, more faith|ful to nature, and more ignorant of refinement, make their &s;ubject of adoration; which to enjoy co&s;t us nothing but the trouble of opening our eyes, and the admi&s;&s;ion of a little heart-felt gratitude. All the&s;e incomparable advantages, though e&s;&s;entially ma|terial to our very exi&s;tence, we take to our&s;elves as
<PB N="15" REF="13">
carele&s;sly and indifferently as any other common benefit of nature, without a remark, without thanks, without emotion, while we rack invention to devi&s;e a thou&s;and expen&s;ive operations to di&s;cover &s;pots which in the &s;cale of the univer&s;e are perfectly im|material; and which, but for this re&s;tle&s;s and in&s;atia|ble curio&s;ity, would for ever have been hidden from our ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEAR who&s;e writings are the offspring of an intuition that mocks de&s;cription, that &s;hames the &s;chools, and that a&s;certains &s;ublimity; who&s;e knowledge of human nature was profound, pene|trating and infallible; who&s;e morality and philo&s;o|phy confirm all that was good and wi&s;e in the an|cients; who&s;e words are in our mouths, and their irre&s;i&s;table influence in our hearts; who&s;e eulogium may be felt but cannot be expre&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e own pen alone was equal to the compo&s;ition of his epitaph: this SHAKESPEAR in the mouths of his fellow creatures is more known for a few incon&s;i|derable blemi&s;hes, &s;prung from redundant fancy and indi&s;pen&s;ible conformity, than for innumerable beauties, delightful as truth, and commanding as in&s;piration.</P>
<P>Look at the various authors who by way of com|pliment to their own &s;agacity have deigned &s;o far
<PB N="16" REF="14">
to honour biography and literature, as to point out all the blemi&s;hes, both as a man and as a writer, of him who&s;e virtue and who&s;e merit were either above their comprehen&s;ion, or el&s;e their tingling envy would not allow them to prai&s;e. Do we hear from them a word of his poli&s;hed manners that made up the delight of the court of ELIZABETH; that laughed EUPHUISM from the circle, and that en|deared him to the friends of lord SOUTHAMPTON, and various other patrons? Not a &s;yllable. They ju&s;t allow that he was a good kind of man, well in|tentioned, but they never fail, by way of a draw|back, to tell you that he was a bungler at wool combing, that he was a notorious deer &s;tealer, and that he turned out a very bad actor.</P>
<P>Have we any author who has had the fair di&s;in|tere&s;tedne&s;s, the noble candour, to indulge him&s;elf and gratify the world by any exclu&s;ive work that has in&s;tanced the various ways in which SHAKES|PEAR &s;o greatly commanded all the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul; in which, with a portraiture full of imagination and faithful as nature, he drew ambition, jealou&s;y, tenderne&s;s, piety, villainy, ra&s;hne&s;s, credulity, licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, and a hundred others with all their &s;hades and gradations? Not one. We have, however, a little myriad of critics and hyper-critics who have done his memory the credit to render his works pro|fitable
<PB N="17" REF="15">
to them&s;elves, by making holes as fa&s;t as tinkers in his reputation which, they fancy and en|deavour to per&s;uade the world they have adroitly mended by patching them up with dro&s;s of their own. Well did he &s;ay that men's perfections are written in &s;and their faults in marble.</P>
<P>In my province, I do not con&s;ider, if I were ever &s;o inclined, that I have a right to examine the private character of any man, farther than as it may have influenced his public conduct; nor even then, unle&s;s it &s;hould relate to his connection with the drama. If, by deduction, I can &s;hew that the world has been impo&s;ed on by a fal&s;e character given in favour of any man's works through patronage pro|cured by adulation, meanne&s;s, and the &s;awning arts of a &s;ycophant, it is very fair to place the public and private &s;entiments of that man by the &s;ide of each other, and to appeal to the world, be this or any other the de&s;cription of his mental blemi&s;hes, whether, by that criterion, they have purcha&s;ed gold or been impo&s;ed on by tin&s;el.</P>
<P>If, on the contrary, I can produce any in&s;tances where meekne&s;s and mode&s;ty have been borne down by rancour and envy, it will be my duty to dwell upon the virtues of him who may have had the pub|lic
<PB N="18" REF="16">
misfortune and the private happine&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e qualities; nor can I lay a claim to impartiality, the forwarde&s;t requi&s;ite of a hi&s;torian, if I neglect in &s;uch ca&s;es to deduce, from the heart of the man, the merit of the poet.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEAR's genius was &s;o brilliant, his know|ledge &s;o wide and univer&s;al, his conception &s;o true, and his &s;entiments &s;o godlike, that to meditate his character is to &s;uppo&s;e perfection. Yes, &s;ay the ca|villers, but his writings are full of faults; and how, as a private man, will he be able to &s;tand or fall upon a compari&s;on with them. Thus quaintne&s;s, in complai&s;ance to the time at which he wrote, temporary &s;atire then, perhaps, excellent, now ob|&s;olete, and other venial inaccuracies, for it is ex|tremely difficult to call them errors, which we ought not to condemn, or, if we ought, do we ea&s;ily know how, are quoted to deface his monument of marble, and tortured into as many &s;hapes as envy has &s;nakes, to ornament a &s;andy beap mi&s;taken by the ig|norant for the monument of his commentators.</P>
<P>But as I mean to allot a chapter to an exami|nation of tho&s;e gentlemen, who would have &s;ound it more to their honour to have excelled SHAKESPEAR by the beauty of their own writings, than to have expo&s;ed their ignorance in cavilling at his; who
<PB N="19" REF="17">
have &s;et about to filtrate air, to elucidate light, and every one of them by a different and con&s;tantly an impracticable proce&s;s; who are like gardeners that cut &s;hrubbery into the forms of birds, pyramids, va&s;es, and other unnatural objects, and call all tho&s;e fools who love to &s;ee nature in her real form, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent content my&s;elf with taking fir&s;t a general, and afterwards a particular view of the writings of SHAKESPEAR, not like a lounger in the boxes who critici&s;es upon fa&s;hions, nor an Ari&s;tarchus in the pit who &s;tretches one fault to hide a thou&s;and perfec|tions, but a &s;pectator in the two &s;hilling gallery, who goes to the play to be plea&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know that in this a&s;&s;ertion I have a right to anticipate a great deal of ridicule. It is a compliment, however, of which I am rather covetous. I have heard it frequently argued that education goes for &s;omething and I &s;hall have SHAKESPEAR's own remark turned again&s;t me,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that the applau&s;e of one of the judicious outweighs a whole theatre of others"</Q>
Certainly I am a great advocate for the advantages of education, though real genius requires but little, and in perver&s;e minds, naturally &s;terile, education generally pre|cludes candour. But education is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in theatrical critici&s;m than in any other. PARTIDGE's thinking BRANSBY the be&s;t actor and giving no merit to GARRICK, becau&s;e he was frightened at the gho&s;t exactly as he &s;hould have been had a gho&s;t appeared to him, is an indelible te&s;t of this. The ob&s;ervation was written by a con&s;um|mate judge of nature, and who, therefore, admired SHAKESPEAR and GARRICK. Education may a&s;certain the purity of diction, may pry into con&s;truction, may find out any violation of the unities, and judge of a poet's blank ver&s;e by the number of his dactyls and his &s;pondees; it has, however, very little of the heart, and will be more likely to &s;uppre&s;s than to &s;timulate tears and &s;miles. A play is, or ought to be, a repre&s;entation of nature, of which every &s;pectator is, as far as his under&s;tanding permits, a judge. Judgement then, not education, is the critical quality, which is le&s;s likely to be per|verted without than with education; and the deduction fairly is, that he who &s;its in a theatre determined to let whatever pa&s;&s;es before, him have its full effect on his pa&s;&s;ions without re&s;erve or abatement, is a fairer and therefore a better theatrical critic than he who weighs every thing in the ballance of con&s;ideration, and while he pau&s;es on the di&s;covery of a few blemi&s;hes, lo&s;es &s;ight of a number of beauties. The &s;pectator in the two &s;hilling gallery then &s;eems be&s;t to an&s;wer this de&s;cription, and it will be difficult to find an argument to prove that in this acceptation SHAKESPEAR did not u&s;e the word judicious.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="18">The writings of SHAKESPEAR take in &s;o large and &s;o wonderful an extent of compa&s;s, that, while we acknowledge that he wrote better, we are obliged to add that he wrote more than any other dramatic writer. One voluminous author writes tragedies for which he is de&s;ervedly celebrated, that after all contain only the repre&s;entations of a few pa&s;&s;ions placed in different points of view; another, equally voluminous, writes comedies, with the &s;ame ju&s;t right to celebration, in which a few follies and ab|&s;urdities are properly ridiculed; SHAKESPEAR goes infinitely beyond all this. He takes the whole round of the pa&s;&s;ions, bends them into every form in which they ought de&s;ervedly to be exhibited, expo&s;es them to contempt, holds them up to ridi|cule, commands for them admiration, conciliates pity, excites terror, and in &s;hort di&s;plays, in his
<PB N="21" REF="19">
faithful portraiture of them, every effect that can unlock the anxious mind, or gratify the &s;u&s;ceptible fancy; and, when &s;atisfied with exploring and laying open to view the motley group of affections that characterize nature in the beings of this world, he &s;tretches his comprehen&s;ive imagination and invents a new world, inhabited with beings the offspring of his own fancy, who in their allegorical character give a refinement to virtue, an aver&s;ion to vice, and a ridicule to folly, which no actual repre&s;entation of them could have had the force or the beauty to convey.</P>
<P>Thus SHAKESPEAR, by having left nothing un|repre&s;ented either as a po&s;itive and naked exhibi|tion of nature, or a deduced and figurative de&s;|cription of her, has gone unequivocally beyond all other writers; and were there nothing el&s;e to &s;anction his a&s;toni&s;hing merit and extend his wide fame, he would yet indi&s;putably &s;tand above all dramatic authors ancient and modern.</P>
<P>But, when we con&s;ider that there had been no &s;chool in which he might &s;tudy this art, that no dra|matic writer &s;ince AESCHYLUS, who&s;e &s;oul &s;eems as if it had tran&s;migrated till it was born anew in SHAKESPEAR, had been equal to the meritoroius ta&s;k of re&s;toring the glare of MELPOMENE's dagger
<PB N="22" REF="20">
and perfecting the poli&s;h on the mirror of THALIA; when we con&s;ider that the theatre in ten years, in the hands of SHAKESPEAR, attained all that perfection which it had lo&s;t for more than two thou&s;and, and boa&s;ted additional perfection never known to it be|fore in the cour&s;e of the world, it is impo&s;&s;ible to contemplate the character of this great man with a degree of wonder equal to its value, which I con|&s;ider as the highe&s;t climax of panegyric; and yet the&s;e con&s;iderations are never afforded, and all we can learn from writers, who&s;e geniu&s;es would be complimented by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a capacity to comprehend the genius of SHAKESPEAR, gives us no more than permi&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;ert, that he was an extraordinary man, when it was admitted that he had received but an indifferent education, and that, though there were pa&s;&s;ages in his works of great and wonderful beauty, there were, neverthele&s;s, nu|merous faults which never ought to be permitted.</P>
<P>As to the faults, I &s;hall &s;peak of them more par|ticularly hereafter, when I think it will not be very difficult to prove that they are not &s;o nu|merous not of &s;uch magnitude as the world is taught to believe by the critics; I do not care much what they them&s;elves believe on the &s;ubject, though I hope for the &s;ake of common &s;en&s;e and their own reputation, they do not believe half they a&s;&s;ert; as
<PB N="23" REF="21">
to the beauties, they are too indelibly impre&s;&s;ed on the heart of every one who has heard or read them to need explanation.</P>
<P>But a few words as to the education of SHAKES|PEAR, for though I am not writing his life I have a great pride in being the hi&s;torian of his mind. He received the common advantages of learning in what is called a grammar &s;chool; that is to &s;ay, a place where a boy of any tolerable genius may learn all that the ma&s;ter is capable of teaching him in &s;ix months, and where boys in general &s;tudy for years and at la&s;t know nothing.</P>
<P>Whether SHAKESPEAR learned little or much at this &s;chool makes nothing either for or again&s;t my argument. I can very willingly &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;cholar was very &s;oon able to teach the ma&s;ter. It was not in this grammar &s;chool where he received that education which has wrought his celebrity. It was in the &s;chool of nature, who conde&s;cended to be his in&s;tructre&s;s. The lady fell in love with him; was captivated; he was her ADONIS, her ENDY|MION, and both her beauty and her cha&s;tity yielded to the irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e; while he, with all the gal|lantry, yet the delicacy of an honourable lover, and a faithful knight, con&s;ecrated his life to the &s;ervice
<PB N="24" REF="22">
of his mi&s;tre&s;s, pleaded her cau&s;e, redre&s;&s;ed her wrongs, and with the true&s;t con&s;tancy and mo&s;t ar|dent gratitude, made her beauty the perpetual theme of his panegyric.</P>
<P>If AESCHYLUS, when, GOD knows, grammar &s;chools had nothing to do with learning, but when men were called wi&s;e becau&s;e they u&s;ed fir&s;t &s;o many words as &s;erved &s;imply to expre&s;s &s;uch ideas as na|ture taught them, and good, becau&s;e their minds adopted no ideas but what tended to promote ge|neral morality: if AESCHYLUS, &s;tudying in the &s;chool of nature, repre&s;ented the great actions and glorious atchievements of his countrymen, and felt emulou&s;ly and meritoriou&s;ly that by that means he &s;hould render GREECE and human nature a benefit, why &s;hould we deny the &s;ame merit to SHAKES|PEAR more than two thou&s;and years afterwards, when grammar &s;chools actually flouri&s;hed. But it would wrong my cau&s;e to wa&s;te too much anxiety about it; and nothing but a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;trong and in|controvertible argument to cope with the opinions of men, certainly great and reputable, except in their charitable warning to the world of faults in another which are not yet, however, generally di&s;|covered, and, after all, not of the magnitude of their own, would have induced me to dwell &s;o
<PB N="25" REF="23">
minutely on a theme that, with men of fair and candid di&s;crimination, recommends it&s;elf and &s;peaks its own eulogium.</P>
<P>The general merit of SHAKESPEAR manife&s;ts it&s;elf in a thou&s;and various ways. Take any one of the pa&s;&s;ions which he has moulded at will to &s;erve the general purpo&s;e of in&s;truction and amu&s;e|ment, and &s;ee to what an a&s;toni&s;hing pitch he has affected the human heart by a critical and intere&s;ting di&s;play of it.</P>
<P>Is the pa&s;&s;ion love? See how he has followed it through all its vici&s;&s;itudes. The delicate tender|ne&s;s, the fond impatience, the impetuous ardour, the noble con&s;tancy of ROMEO and JULIET, per|haps, has not a parallel in language. To youthful love every thing is po&s;&s;ible; and the exqui&s;ite non|&s;en&s;e that SHAKESPEAR has put into the mouth of the doating, enamoured, yet delicate JULIET, is full of poetic beauty, &s;o boundle&s;sly, &s;o extrava|gant, and yet &s;o truly natural, that we are equally captivated with her love and her innocence.</P>
<P>The love of ROMEO is no le&s;s admirably drawn, It is impetuous, thoughtle&s;s, and ra&s;h, yet manly,
<PB N="26" REF="24">
noble, and generous; but its characteri&s;tic is nature, He leaps the orchard wall and braves the re&s;entment of JULIET's relations, out of love, yet pre&s;ently, out of this very love, he becomes a coward and puts up with an in&s;ult from of tho&s;e relations; nor is he rou&s;ed out of this apathy till called upon to revenge the death of his friend.</P>
<P>In the garden &s;cene, &s;urely nothing can be &s;o beautiful as the enchanted, yet re&s;pectful, manner in which he li&s;tens to the unaffected tenderne&s;s, the timid hone&s;ty, the techy impatience of JULIET. His love, profound, and awful, recedes from his tongue to his heart; her's, incon&s;iderate and volatile, flies from her heart to her tongue, till, at length im|pelled to reply to her fond confe&s;&s;ion, which di&s;|dains all hypocri&s;y, and derides all &s;ubterfuge, they join in interchanging vows, tender and affectionate on her part, manly and honourable on his.</P>
<P>Ab&s;ence only renders more amiable the noble and exalted minds of tho&s;e lovers. His de&s;pair at hearing the &s;entence of bani&s;hment, his horror at the news of JULIET's death, and his &s;olemn deter|mination to follow her; and her re&s;igned compli|ance with the friar's &s;tratagem, her awful manner of executing it, and her de&s;troying her&s;elf, after every
<PB N="27" REF="25">
hope has failed her, are ma&s;terly pictures of ex|qui&s;ite love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MERCIER was &s;o charmed with ROMEO and JULIET, and &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed that the lovers &s;hould become victims to the unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable enmity of their families, that he has given the plot a new turn. The play never was performed, but it has all the de|licacy, fine&s;&s;e, and truth of that admirable author. BENVOLIO, having long fore&s;een the con&s;equence of this family hatred, does his utmo&s;t to excite the love of ROMEO and JULIET, in order to bring about a reconciliation. He finds both the families aver&s;e to his pro|ject, and, therefore, connives at a private marriage. Every thing happens as in SHAKESPEAR's play. BENVOLIO, however, in the place of the friar, having from his infancy &s;tudied chemi&s;try, ad|mini&s;ters a potion to JULIET; and, contriving that ROMEO &s;hould be informed of the death, furni&s;hes him with another. ROMEO opens the tomb and finding JULIET apparently dead, drinks the potion and falls down at her &s;ide. In the mean, BENVOLIO having alarmed the two fathers they pre&s;ently behold their two children in this &s;tate. After reading to them a &s;evere lecture, and reproaching them for their conduct and the dreadful con&s;equences of their mutual enmity, he hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;es that he has wrought all this; tel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters"> them that this &s;eeming death of the&s;e lovers is but a &s;leep; that he alone, however, knows the charm to revive them; and that, if they will di&s;card their unju&s;t anger and vow perpetual amity, their children &s;hall wake and revive the double plea&s;ure of being re&s;tored to life and to the arms of their parents; but that, if they he&s;itate, it will be too late. In that ca&s;e he knows he &s;hall be con&s;idered as their murderer, but that he would rather die than witne&s;s a rancour &s;o di&s;honourable to them&s;elves and &s;uch a &s;candal to human nature. The re&s;ult is obvious. The lovers revive, and their affection is crowned with the approbation and ble&s;&s;ing of their fathers. I &s;hall only add that the Frenchman merely alters the &s;tory; he does not attempt to improve upon SHAKESPEAR, who&s;e genius he reverences, and to who&s;e pro|ductions he had upon all occa&s;ions mo&s;t willingly paid a warm tri|bute of admiration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="26">Were I to go on inve&s;tigating the various ways in which SHAKESPEAR has treated this one pa&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould greatly exceed the limits I am obliged to pre&s;cribe for my&s;elf.

<HEAD>CHAP. III. SHAKESPEAR's PLAYS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Titus Andronicus</HI> is &s;aid by the regulation before alluded to to have been SHAKESPEAR's fir&s;t play, and printed in 1611, but performed in 1589<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To &s;hew how ea&s;y it is to cavil, I &s;hall in&s;tance a circum&s;tance here, which, though of &s;o little moment that to mention it as a thing of con&s;equence would be almo&s;t as ab&s;urd as to get involved in the cobweb enquiries of his commentators, will &s;hew that it is impo&s;&s;ible that SHAKESPEAR's fir&s;t play could have been produced in 1589; for in that very year in the mayoralty of HART, a thing extremely ea&s;y to a&s;certain, players of all de&s;criptions were ab&s;olutely put down upon the application of that magi&s;trate to the lord trea&s;urer. We &s;ee, however, that immediately after that year, playhou&s;es were created as by magic; and, as there can be no doubt, but all this aro&s;e from the extraordinary and unexpected excellence of the writings of SHAKESPEAR, it is more proper, though it is a pityful contention, to fix the appearance of his fir&s;t play one year, if not two years later. In which ca&s;e what becomes of that authority, which though I cannot bow to, I &s;hall adopt, merely becau&s;e a year &s;ooner or later in the production of a thing will not alter the &s;terling merit of the thing it&s;elf.</NOTE>. All this may be po&s;&s;ible, but the general accounts of it &s;ay
<PB N="31" REF="29">
that it was performed in 1594, by the &s;ervants of lord PEMBROKE, lord DERBY, and lord ESSEX. Much has been &s;aid to prove that this play was not written by our great poet; the arguments, however, to prove this are rather nugatory. RAVENSCROFT, who altered it and called it a tragedy of his own, might very naturally have had per&s;onal rea&s;ons for inducing the world to think that it was not SHAKES|PEAR's; but his argument, that it was brought to the theatre and touched up by SHAKESPEAR, is too ridiculous, for he was at that time only an actor and could not have taken the manager upon him to this degree.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e who reject this play as SHAKESPEAR's think it inferior to the re&s;t of his productions, the doubt is ea&s;ily cleared by recollecting that it was his fir&s;t effort. There are certainly &s;ome things in it equal to his happie&s;t &s;allies; and, as we know tho&s;e are &s;uperior to the writings of any man who ever lived, the que&s;tion to be a&s;ked is, and this will per|petually occur, if SHAKESPEAR did not write <HI>Titus Andronicus,</HI> who did?</P>
<P>THEOBALD, who after all is the mo&s;t pardonable of all SHAKESPEAR's commentators, has taken this play into his edition as genuine; and, notwith&s;tand|ing this opinion of his has been lu&s;tily combated by
<PB N="32" REF="30">
later conjecture, that, backed by the &s;trong writings, the di&s;crimination of character, and tho&s;e peculiar marks of genius which were worne &s;o indelibly by SHAKESPEAR, and which appear, not always, but very frequently in this play, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to believe, and therefore a&s;&s;ert that it is written by that great man with whom nature, a proud di&s;tinction, complimented this country.</P>
<P><HI>Love's Labour Lo&s;t,</HI> performed, at lea&s;t we will &s;o conclude, in 1591, has, as well as <HI>Titus Andro|nicus,</HI> been rejected as a genuine play of SHAKES|PEAR. The cabal again&s;t it, however, has not run &s;o high, and, therefore, all his editors, poor SHAKES|PEAR, Oh that admiration and pity &s;hould belong to the &s;ame man! have concurred right or wrong to admit it into their collections.</P>
<P>As <HI>Titus Andronicus</HI> was SHAKESPEAR's fir&s;t tragedy, &s;o <HI>Love's Labour Lo&s;t</HI> was his fir&s;t comedy, and thus the whole my&s;tery appears to be &s;olved. The&s;e plays are full of irregularities owing clearly to the inexperience of the author, the prejudices he had to combat, and the ta&s;te he had to create. When HERCULES cleared the Augean &s;table it was very unlikely that he came out clean him&s;elf. Why will not men be candid? Why not &s;ay at once that it is not in nature to attain perfection in a moment, if at
<PB N="33" REF="31">
all. If they would lament in&s;tead of condemn, and extol in&s;tead of commend, it would be the true cri|tici&s;m due to SHAKESPEAR.</P>
<P><HI>Love's Labour Lo&s;t</HI> abounds with beauties. The character of BIRON, con&s;idered as &s;o early an effort, is inimitable. The admirable brilliancy which per|vades the dialogue has no fault but playful redun|dancy, and though it has been objected to, by Dr. JOHNSON, as ob&s;cene and vulgar, and improper to have been performed before a maiden queen, who, by the way, had been accu&s;tomed to li&s;ten to much wor&s;e ob&s;cenity and vulgarity, for the ob&s;cenity of SHAKESPEAR is purity compared to tho&s;e who wrote before him, yet this great admirer of truth and &s;en|timent is compelled to allow that there is no play
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that has more evident marks of the hand of SHAKESPEAR."</Q></P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, SHAKESPEAR is &s;aid to have produced the fir&s;t part of <HI>Henry the Sixth,</HI> and in the following year the &s;econd and third parts of the &s;ame play; and, as there is a continuation of the &s;tory of that unhappy prince, I &s;hall con&s;ider them under one head.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEAR had hitherto indulged his pro|pen&s;ity
<PB N="34" REF="32">
for dramatic writing by treating &s;ubjects with which his principles as a patriot were not con|cerned. He had only con&s;ulted his feelings as a poet. If from de&s;ign, the election was judicious; if from impul&s;e, nature was working in him that maturity nece&s;&s;ary to atchieve the great de&s;igns &s;he was meditating for him, for now the time arrived when he was de&s;tined to prove him&s;elf the Engli&s;h AESCHYLUS; when the fancied prowe&s;s of foreign or imaginary heroes was to yield to the actual ex|ploits of his own countrymen; to be handed down by him as a faithful record of all the virtues and vices of the Engli&s;h nation for the imitation or ab|horrence of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>No pen but that of SHAKESPEAR was competent to undertake this ma&s;terly ta&s;k. To become the dramatic hi&s;torian of his own country became pe|culiarly his province, and there are more traits of real hi&s;tory at this moment remembered by the En|li&s;h through the medium of his plays than all that library of contradiction and ab&s;urdity, which, as an ingenius author &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;ome have been facetiou&s;ly plea&s;ed to call <HI>The Hi&s;tory of England.</HI>"</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e three plays contain mo&s;t wonderful proofs of SHAKESPEAR's great and extraordinary genius. The characters are drawn with correct truth and
<PB N="35" REF="33">
prodigious force. The timid HENRY led about by his turbulent queen, the bold WARWICK, the &s;ub|tle GLOUCESTER, who&s;e different ambitions and the means of attaining their end exhibit a mo&s;t com|manding and ma&s;terly judgment in the manner of throwing over that pa&s;&s;ion the different &s;hadows ne|ce&s;&s;ary to relieve it, are &s;o many confirmations of his gra&s;ping at all minds and at all motives.</P>
<P>The philo&s;ophy and re&s;ignation of HENRY is un|commonly admirable. The di&s;tinction between goodne&s;s and greatne&s;s, one the perfection of na|ture and an emulation of the deity; the other a mixture of artificial wants interwoven into our de|de&s;ires and actions by re&s;tle&s;s and ambitious &s;trug|gles for &s;uperiority, are exhibited ma&s;terly and happily in the contra&s;t between HENRY and MAR|GARET, both of whom are in nature and yet both out of their &s;phere. If SHAKESPEAR had written nothing but that wonderful &s;oliloquy uttered by the timid HENRY, while he &s;its upon the hill contem|plating the dreadful effects of that battle he has not the courage to witne&s;s, po&s;terity would have pointed out the page as a ma&s;ter piece of beauty and &s;ublimity.</P>
<P>But to dwell upon the &s;eparate merits of the&s;e
<PB N="36" REF="34">
plays would be to write a treati&s;e in&s;tead of a hi&s;tory. It would require an examination into all tho&s;e nice points of di&s;crimination in which nature taught SHAKESPEAR to develope the motives of the human heart. I &s;hall content my&s;elf, therefore, with no|ticing that SHAKESPEAR having thus far &s;hewn in what way the affections of the mind may be merit|oriou&s;ly wrought on to &s;timulate men to good and great actions, and in&s;tanced the&s;e truths by portray|ing manners at home, the &s;tage began to grow im|portant, the characters in common life as well as tho&s;e of kings and heroes became familiar by pa&s;&s;ing in review, and the conduct of mankind im|bibed new dignity from an attention to the le&s;&s;ons of SHAKESPEAR.</P>
<P><HI>Pericles</HI> was, as we are told, performed in 1592. It would be as difficult to pronounce that this play was wholly written by SHAKESPEAR as that it was not. That he had not a hand in it, or, as HEYWOOD calls it, at lea&s;t a main finger will hardly be a&s;&s;erted for it has tho&s;e marks of peculiar felicity which I cannot think any mind enjoyed in the &s;ame degree as that of SHAKESPEAR; but, as it is more natural that he &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t the labours of another than con|de&s;cend to permit another to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and, as at the time of <HI>Pericles</HI> there is not the &s;ame excu&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="35">
of inexperience as at the time of <HI>Titus Andronicus,</HI> it is certainly &s;ea&s;ible to join with the major part of tho&s;e who have been &s;o &s;olicitous to e&s;tabli&s;h a fact, not, however, very material, and allow that the opinion that <HI>Pericles</HI> is not entirely the pro|duction of SHAKESPEAR has certainly probability on its &s;ide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is one way of reconciling the mind to a belief of SHAKES|PEAR's having produced this play without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any au|thor then living. The &s;tory is very ancient and had been treated frequently before, and it is po&s;&s;ible, e&s;pecially as it mu&s;t have been very ha&s;tily written, SHAKESPEAR having in the &s;ame year brought forward his &s;econd and third parts of <HI>Henry the Sixth,</HI> that he merely dramatized the &s;tory from one or more of its hi&s;torians; and by throwing in his own excellent ingredients, gave it in &s;ome mea&s;ure that peculiar reli&s;h &s;o delicious to the ta&s;te of tho&s;e who love to banquet the mind with the whole&s;ome and nutrious food, furni&s;hed by nature and prepared by rea&s;on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Loerine</HI> produced in 1593, has &s;till fewer pre|tentions to be con&s;idered as a genuine play of SHAKESPEAR than <HI>Pericles.</HI> Indeed it has &s;carcely any ve&s;tiges by which it appears to have the ad|vantages of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;ome, however, there cer|tainly are, for in the edition of it, publi&s;hed in 1595, the title announces that it was
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"over&s;een and cor|rected by WILLIAM SHAKESPEAR,"</Q>
and this very unaffectedly e&s;tabli&s;hes a proof that it mu&s;t have been the production of &s;ome author of that
<PB N="38" REF="36">
time who was glad enough to benefit him&s;elf by &s;uch able a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>The two Gentlemen of Verona</HI> made its appear|ance in the &s;ame year. This piece di&s;plays a pro|digious variety of tho&s;e beauties which belonged only to SHAKESPEAR. The plot, which is taken from a novel, as far as it relates to the management of the &s;cenery is certainly very intricate and almo&s;t inexplicable, but con&s;idered merely as a &s;tory, it has great &s;implicity and nature. The characters are drawn with &s;trength and truth, and it is remarkable that in this play we have the fir&s;t idea of what has been &s;ince called genteel comedy. The elegance, yet the contra&s;t in VALENTINE and PROTHEUS, is a very &s;triking picture, not only of the etiquette, but the perfidy of polite life; for PROTHEUS is more corrupted by education than nature, of which his remor&s;e and his contrition are proofs, while VA|LENTINE has a mind &s;o correctly inclined to rec|titude that fa&s;hion and folly cannot corrupt it.</P>
<P>But this is not all. The two &s;ervants, LAUNCE and SPEED, who are the foils of their ma&s;ters, make the whole a complete re&s;emblance of that &s;ort of play which is the foundation of almo&s;t all the come|dies of both the Spaniards and the French; and as the&s;e plays did not obtain with them, at lea&s;t in this
<PB N="39" REF="37">
perfect form, till CALDERON, who was cotemporary with CORNEILLE, SHAKESPEAR may be &s;aid to have been the founder of this &s;pecies of comedy. We mu&s;t admit at the &s;ame time that the germ was in the Spaniards, but his mind was the only &s;oil which could expand and bring it to perfection.</P>
<P>The chronological order, which I pur&s;ue right or wrong in this accout of SHAKESPEAR's pro|ductions, even if it &s;hould he deficient in veracity, has certainly the appearance of good &s;en&s;e in its fa|vour, for it &s;eems to lay before the reader that &s;ort of rotation in which a well wi&s;her to his reputation would de&s;ire that he had written them. The re|dundant luxuriance, in which, in the wilds of SHAKESPEAR's abundant and productive imagi|nation, one cannot &s;ometimes &s;ee the wood for trees, begins as he goes on to be more and more got under. The underwood is better cleared out and the plants, intended to &s;well and enlarge, have more room and better air to accelerate their ap|proach to maturity.</P>
<P><HI>The two Gentlemen of Verona</HI> abounds with poeti|cal beauties &s;uch as we have not before been able to di&s;cover even in SHAKESPEAR. His towering fancy in this particular piece playfully a&s;cends to tho&s;e &s;ublime heights, dangerous to others but
<PB N="40" REF="38">
always familiar to him; &s;ometimes hazardous, but never alarming; often trackle&s;s, yet always a&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P><HI>The Winter's Tale</HI> was performed in 1594. When the grand objection in this play is got over which is the very long period of time it embraces, and the dif|ferent countries it traver&s;es, we turn our thoughts to the numerous and inimitable beauties in contains; which, whether con&s;idered on the &s;ide of character or language, are in the be&s;t &s;tyle of SHAKESPEAR. This play has been very judiciou&s;ly &s;eperated into two dramatic pieces; and, viewed in this advanta|geous light, it has very few faults of any de&s;cription. The &s;ubject of that which GARRICK brought for|ward as a tragedy in three acts under its original title, and in which, to do him ju&s;tice, he &s;acredly &s;teered clear of mutilation, as he did al&s;o in his al|teration of <HI>Romeo and Juliet,</HI> is great, natural, and affecting.</P>
<P>Jealou&s;y, of which turbulent pa&s;&s;ion SHAKES|PEAR has &s;o often evinced a mo&s;t critical judg|ment, for he has always given it a different mo|tive and a different di&s;crimination, is mo&s;t pathe|tically depicted in the character of LEONTES, and gives a lively and noble opportunity of bringing forward contra&s;t, the life of the drama, by the
<PB N="41" REF="39">
honourable and con&s;cious rectitude in the ju&s;tifi|cation of HERMIONE. The loves of FLORIZEL and PERDITA, which form the other piece, are &s;o &s;imple, &s;o pa&s;toral, &s;o tender, and &s;o delicate, that their force and their language are the de&s;cription of an amiable and meritorious pa&s;&s;ion, belonging to all ranks, and equally a ble&s;&s;ing to the pea&s;ant and the prince. In &s;hort, love and its vici&s;&s;itudes mark the various merits of this admirable piece, which SHAKESPEAR, here as every where el&s;e, has ex|plored at will, and turned to advantage at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><HI>A Mid&s;ummer's Night's Dream</HI> came out in 1595, SHAKESPEAR, having ranged &s;o far through the fields of nature, began now to feel an inclination to explore the regions of fancy; which he did to &s;o good a purpo&s;e, that all the critics, even the mo&s;t &s;arca&s;tic, have agreed, that in this wild and beautiful play, if the fairies do not &s;peak the language of common nature no one can pronounce that they do not &s;peak their own.</P>
<P>Every writer, equal to the ta&s;k, compliments his country by di&s;playing all the poetic fare of which his genius is capable. Here has SHAKESPEAR in one in&s;tance paid his country this compliment. Common tradition had fanciliarized the idea of
<PB N="42" REF="40">
fairies, and many a ballad and poem had made them the lares of the Engli&s;h. His fertile and creative fancy, therefore could not, to &s;hew its extent and variety, have been better employed. SPENSER had trod the ground before him, with prodigious felicity and &s;terling excellence; but SHAKESPEAR, born to &s;oar above all others, repre&s;ented what his great predece&s;&s;or only narrated.</P>
<P>We come now to con&s;ider SHAKESPEAR every moment in a &s;uperior light, for great and admirable as his talents have hitherto appeared, they are yet growing con&s;iderably into much more &s;trength and improvement.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo and Juliet</HI> his next play, which was pro|duced al&s;o in 1595, is a wonderful performance; and how we can po&s;&s;ibly under&s;tand that, &s;o &s;oon after his mind had been entangled in the labyrinths of enchantment, and his fancy frolicking over the imaginary beauties of Fairy land, he could calmly &s;et down exqui&s;itely to de&s;cribe literal nature, will be difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This play, which is founded on real hi&s;tory, is &s;o con&s;tantly in the mouths of its various &s;pectators and readers that to de&s;cribe particularly the tender|ne&s;s of the lovers, the rooted animo&s;ity of their
<PB N="43" REF="41">
parents, the different effects of re&s;entment in their relations, in &s;hort, the piety of the Friar, the loqua|city of the Nur&s;e, the wit of MERCUTIO, or tho&s;e other points that con&s;titute its beauty and make up its collective merit is certainly unnece&s;&s;ary; but, as every opportunity of paying a tribute of re&s;pect to the admirable genius of its incomparable author is with me irre&s;i&s;table, I &s;hall &s;peak of &s;ome things which have not probably yet been noticed.</P>
<P><HI>Romeo and Juliet</HI> is be&s;t known by that copy of it which is generally performed, and in which GAR|RICK has very judiciou&s;ly done little more than make SHAKESPEAR alter his own play, fitting the cata&s;trophe to the original invention of the noveli&s;t. The two grand points that GARRICK, by the advice of his friends, has in&s;i&s;ted on, are the expunging the idea of ROSALIND, and ROMEO's &s;udden incon|&s;tancy on the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of JULIET's &s;uperior beauty, and heightening the cata&s;trophe, by RO|MEO's fir&s;t &s;wallowing the poi&s;on, then in the ex|tacy of finding JULIET &s;urvive, forgetting the de&s;|perate act he had committed, and flattering him&s;elf with a delu&s;ive hope of future happine&s;s, and, again, the a&s;toni&s;hment and delight of JULIET at re|covering her lover, all which is in&s;tantly damped by a di&s;covery that her &s;allacious hopes are to be but momentary.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="42">It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed the&s;e alterations are more admi&s;&s;ible by common auditors, than the incidents as they originally &s;tood; not that they were forced or unnatural before, for violent love breeds with it incon&s;tancy, becau&s;e it is always incon&s;iderate, or, as JULIET &s;weetly expre&s;&s;es it,
<Q><SP>
<L>too ra&s;h, too unadvi&s;ed,</L>
<L>Too like the lightening, which doth cea&s;e to be</L>
<L>Ere one can &s;ay it lightens,</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>But this does not &s;eem to be all that SHAKES|PEAR intended in ROMEO's amorous apo&s;tacy. He has appeared to in&s;i&s;t upon this incident to give an awful grandeur to his plot, the great drift of which is, and this has been but little con&s;idered, the &s;olemn warning to MONTAGUE and CAPULET, by the dreadful &s;acrifice of their children, and in them to all other parents, of the horrid effects of dome&s;tic enmity.</P>
<P>To bring about this great and important end, is ROMEO made incon&s;tant; is JULIET, who had been taught all her life to hate the MONTAGUES, made as &s;uddenly to fall in love with her mortal enemy; or, as &s;he de&s;cribes it, her only love &s;prung from her only hate. The&s;e circum&s;tances di&s;cover a depth, a &s;olidity of which SHAKESPEAR is oftener capable than &s;u&s;pected. This love, &s;o
<PB N="45" REF="43">
born, he contrives with the pen of a poet and the hand of a ma&s;ter, in various ways and by various degrees, to warm and encourage, till he makes even the Friar con&s;ent to the union of the lovers, which it was po&s;itively his duty not to do, from a reflection that Providence, from this fortunate event, might &s;o open the eyes of the parents to the folly and in|ju&s;tice of their mutual and long-exi&s;ting animo&s;ity, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to turn their hou&s;es rancour to pure love."</Q></P>
<P>This very cata&s;trophe has even been attempted, but never with &s;ucce&s;s, for it could not be &s;o im|pre&s;&s;ive nor &s;o tragic. I have &s;hewn in the plot of MERCIER of how much it is capable, but SHAKES|PEAR did not look &s;o &s;uper&s;icially. Meritorious puni&s;hment has been clearly with him his decided drift. Even the lovers tender, delicate, and ho|nourable as they are, merit puni&s;hment; for their conduct is thoughtle&s;sly a deviation from the very principles they profe&s;s; it is born of imprudence, and nur&s;ed by deceit; and, in this point of view, it is better that ROMEO &s;hould have been incon|&s;tant, and JULIET at lea&s;t capricious.</P>
<P>Nay, the imprudence of the Friar, with all his wi&s;dom and &s;agacity, is mo&s;t admirably thrown in. Having in one in&s;tance, from the be&s;t motives in the world, done a po&s;itive wrong he is obliged to
<PB N="46" REF="44">
per&s;i&s;t, &s;till comforting him&s;elf with the purity of his intentions. He becomes the honourable pan|der of the lovers, he leagues with a chattering and perfidious &s;ervant, who&s;e hone&s;ty he fears, and who&s;e &s;ervility he ought to di&s;tru&s;t. In&s;tead of wi&s;ely attempting to apply a &s;olid remedy, in&s;tead of manfully &s;tepping forward and avowing the mar|riage of ROMEO and JULIET, at the moment &s;he is menaced with the hand of PARIS, and attempt|ing, through the mediation of the Prince, to bring about a reconciliation between the two families; he, timid, irre&s;olute, and one would almo&s;t think vain of his judgment in the conduct of intrigue, advi&s;es a de&s;perate and unwi&s;e means, not to bring about any wi&s;hed for end, but to proca&s;tinate and put off the evil day at the hazard of accumulated mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The &s;um of his danger is by this time &s;o a&s;cer|tained that he has cut off his own retreat. He, therefore, makes another confident in Friar JOHN, employs him to carry a letter, which mi&s;carrying, he &s;eizes his iron crow and romantically undertakes him&s;elf to relea&s;e JULIET from the vault of her ance&s;tors. All this folly is he guilty of, and yet you pity and almo&s;t admire him from beginning to end; but remember it is impo&s;&s;ible to commend him, and this is the nice di&s;tinction SHAKESPEAR
<PB N="47" REF="45">
has &s;o well drawn; pointing out, that in the be&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t, a &s;ingle deviation from the path of rectitude mu&s;t lead to remor&s;e and may, perhaps, to puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>As to the character of MERCUTIO, concerning which &s;o much has been &s;aid and written, SHAKES|PEAR has certainly introduced it to give fre&s;h force to the colouring his main de&s;ign. He repre&s;ents this young officer as an elegant man, a complete gentleman, and an accompli&s;hed wit, and that the characters in the play, and the &s;pectators at it, may look with additional horror at the family di&s;putes of the MONTAGUES and the CAPULETS, he is lo&s;t, to one, at a time of life when his brilliant talents and engaging manners are at their height, and, therefore, ardently cheri&s;hed by his friends, and, to the other, at the moment he has become their delight and admiration.</P>
<P>In the face of DRYDEN, who&s;e great talents I &s;hall have hereafter plenty of opportunity to &s;hew how &s;incerely I reverence, I look upon this to have been SHAKESPEAR's &s;ole motive for killing MER|CUTIO &s;o early in the play. It had been &s;aid by the critics that SHAKESPEAR had &s;o &s;urpa&s;&s;ed his own expectation in the character of MERCUTIO that he killed him in the third act, le&s;t, had be con|tinued
<PB N="48" REF="46">
him, he &s;hould have been killed by him; and this DRYDEN has affected to &s;mile at, under an idea that he was
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"no &s;uch formidable per&s;on, for that he might have lived through the play and died in his bed without any danger to a poet."</Q></P>
<P>This tradition, and this declaration are equally wrong. The trait of MERCUTIO's death, in the manner we witne&s;s it, is, for the rea&s;ons I have given above, a mo&s;t affecting circum&s;tance, and that SHAKESPEAR could not have carried on this cha|racter to the end of ten plays with the &s;ame force and &s;pirit is ridiculous to a&s;&s;ert. On the other hand; that DRYDEN, who was all candour and full of judg|ment, &s;hould think &s;o indifferently of the wit of MERCUTIO, is not very ea&s;ily under&s;tood, even with Dr. JOHNSON's mode of accounting for it, who &s;ays that, in this remark,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"DRYDEN was not in que&s;t of truth,"</Q>
and that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the &s;allies of MER|CUTIO were beyond his reach,"</Q>
for no man &s;earched more after truth than DRYDEN, and he has given &s;ufficient proof in his own admirable writings that the higher the &s;allies of any wit were elevated they would the more ea&s;ily come in contact with his genius.</P>
<P>But to put a&s;ide the curious que&s;tion of whe|ther or not SHAKESPEAR created a per&s;onage and
<PB N="49" REF="47">
then was &s;o terrified at his formidable appearance, that he watched an opportunity and gave him an unlucky blow under ROMEO's arm for fear of wor&s;e con&s;equences to him&s;elf; that great judge of na|ture, who violated propriety much &s;eldomer than has been generally admitted, had a motive for bringing about this premature death which does not &s;eem to have been noticed.</P>
<P>ROMEO, having killed TIBALT, it would have been manife&s;t inju&s;tice in the Duke not to have taken <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the forfeit life of ROMEO"</Q> had he not qualified his &s;entence of bani&s;hment with de&s;cribing TIBALT's crime to have been wor&s;e than ROMEO's. SHAKESPEAR, therefore, makes MERCUTIO the Duke's relation;
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"who, as his blood had i&s;&s;ued from MERCUTIO's wounds,"</Q>
who&s;e life ROMEO endeavoured to &s;ave, &s;ees the crime in a much more heinous light in TIBALT than in ROMEO, and, therefore, when MONTAGUE pleads for his &s;on &s;aying that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he but took the forfeit life of TIBALT,"</Q> the di&s;crimination of bani&s;hment is correctly con|&s;i&s;tent. Thus in perfect con&s;onance to dramatic con&s;truction, a &s;ubordinate character is di&s;po&s;ed of to give better opportunity of keeping a principal character in the fore ground; and this I believe is a rational way of accounting for this mighty circum|&s;tance
<PB N="50" REF="48">
which has created &s;o much cavil than to &s;up|po&s;e, admirable as the character of MERCUTIO is, that SHAKESPEAR was at all afraid of continuing it to the end with encrea&s;ed warmth, had propriety warranted this nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Before we leave <HI>Romeo and Juliet,</HI> we mu&s;t not forget to notice the Nur&s;e; a &s;ort of character in which SHAKESPEAR took particular delight, be|cau&s;e he delighted in every thing that was natural. He has made this talkative old woman full of &s;elf importance, and, therefore, &s;he is permitted to take liberties which no other de&s;cription of &s;ervants would dare to do; but having given her all the low and corrupted cunning of a thorough paced mercenary dome&s;tic, from her own depravity of mind and liquori&s;h vanity, &s;he endeavours to &s;e|duce that beauty and innocence which is the con|&s;tant theme of her prai&s;e; and having per&s;uaded her into &s;omething more than imprudence in her mar|riage with ROMEO, to avert the con&s;equences, &s;he does not he&s;itate to devi&s;e an infamous method of compounding the bu&s;ine&s;s by her marriage, never|thele&s;s, with PARIS.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of cunning which is coun|teracted by her ignorance, thus &s;he in&s;inuates her|&s;elf into the &s;ecrets of her young lady to gain over
<PB N="51" REF="49">
her an in&s;olent a&s;cendancy, and thus, a &s;tranger to the gratitude due to her benefactors, &s;he abu&s;es that indulgence, and betrays that confidence of which they them&s;elves ought to have known her unworthy.</P>
<P>There cannot be a properer le&s;&s;on to parents and children than this. Half, perhaps nine tenths of the various in&s;tances of family mi&s;ery happen through the improper confidence placed in &s;ervants; and thus SHAKESPEAR has made this nur&s;e, who after all may be in great mea&s;ure excu&s;ed on the &s;core of pampered indulgence which &s;he ignorantly takes to her&s;elf as her right, and implicit reliance which gives her a reprehen&s;ible importance, an in&s;tru|ment to &s;hew by what natural degrees the &s;malle&s;t neglect of prudence in parents may produce the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences to their children, and how a diviation of prudence in children may prove a &s;ource of mi&s;ery and regret to their parents.</P>
<P>Thus it is impo&s;&s;ible to blame any thing in the conduct or con&s;truction of this play. It is in vain to &s;ay that tragedy and comedy are unnaturally blended together, for the rever&s;e is the fact. The &s;tory is purely dome&s;tic; and familiar circum&s;tances, how|ever productive in the end of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, ought not to be treated otherwi&s;e than as SHAKES|PEAR
<PB N="52" REF="50">
has treated them; nay, in this play particu|larly, he has managed the comic part with a mo&s;t happy judgment; for, as the play advances and the intere&s;t it is intended to create becomes more and more important, the comic characters drop off and leave the mind at lei&s;ure, without mixture or inter|ruption, to attend to the plot as it approaches to, perhaps, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting cata&s;trophe ever repre|&s;ented to an audience; and here we have another proof of the great propriety of SHAKESPEAR's kil|ling MERCUTIO in the third act.</P>
<P><HI>The Comedy of Errors</HI> was produced the year after <HI>Romeo and Juliet.</HI> The objections that have been made to this play are that it outrages proba|bility, that the mi&s;takes are repeated till they tire, and that the cata&s;trophe is fore&s;een in the fir&s;t act.</P>
<P>Certainly probability is a good deal &s;tretched of the idea that the Twin Ma&s;ters and the Twin Servants &s;hould be &s;o remarkably alike, and this is all, for it is clearly po&s;&s;ible, and if the audience were only pre&s;ented with one of tho&s;e gemini no man could have cavilled at it, I am glad, however, that SHAKESPEAR gave us two, though not &s;trictly within the bounds of propriety, for the abundant opportunity it has given him of indulging that true vein of comic humour he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;uch an ex|traordinary
<PB N="53" REF="51">
degree overcomes, liberally taken, all objection.</P>
<P>The mi&s;takes are very frequently repeated, and at length they as certainly tire, but this is more owing to the impo&s;&s;ibility of properly repre&s;enting the play than the want of variety in its author. Could we get two Antipolu&s;es and two Dromios exactly alike, the audience, would be equally de|ceived with the characters and the equivoque would be complete.</P>
<P>As to the anticipation of the cata&s;trophe, my objection is not &s;o &s;trong to that as that the cata&s;tro|phe it&s;elf is a kind of vehicle, a kind of underpart, to &s;et off the detached &s;cenes. But I do not much in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e mind this. I know of eminent painters who are be&s;t known by their &s;ketches. Let us, therefore, con&s;ider <HI>The Comedy of Errors,</HI> though by the way there is a wonderful deal of fine pen|celling in it, as a &s;ketch; and let us not, becau&s;e every thing that comes from the hand of a great ma&s;ter cannot always be perfect, critici&s;e our&s;elves, in our examination of this play, out of the irre&s;i&s;ta|ble plea&s;ure it con&s;tantly affords us both on the &s;tage and in the clo&s;et.</P>
<P>If the objections of the critics to <HI>The Comedy
<PB N="54" REF="52">
of Errors</HI> require &s;o &s;trong a defence, what mu&s;t be the critical fate of <HI>Hamlet?</HI> Which, with all its tran&s;cendant beauties, its prodigious &s;trength, its fa|&s;cinating charms, its rivetting intere&s;t, and its extra|ordinary variety, has more faults than the critics have time to tell, or breath to give utterance.</P>
<P><HI>Hamlet</HI> was brought out in 1596; and, when we con&s;ider that this wonderful production, worth the reputation of twenty celebrated authors, and I &s;hould not be fearful of naming them, was written, together with the four la&s;t plays we have received, in two years, what words can the be&s;t ingenuity &s;upply us with equal to the de&s;cription of the a&s;to|ni&s;hing talents of this incomparable writer!</P>
<P>I know not if the objections to this play excite mo&s;t one's pity or one's indignation. I'll admit at once all the faults; but ju&s;tice, truth, common &s;en&s;e forbid, that this mi&s;t of faults &s;hould ob&s;cure, in any liberal mind, the &s;plendour they are ignorantly &s;aid to hide. I'll admit the tardine&s;s of HAMLET, I'll admit that the Gho&s;t is not revenged becau&s;e the in&s;trument of the revenge falls in accompli&s;hing the death of the adulterer, and the murderer; I'll admit that the death of the unoffending OPHELIA is revolting and unnece&s;&s;ary; that the amiable LAERTES, practi&s;ing again&s;t the life of HAM|LET
<PB N="55" REF="53">
by the treachery, is unbecoming, and even ignoble.</P>
<P>I will even admit with Mr. VOLTAIRE, who abu&s;ed this play and afterwards &s;tole it, that the grave diggers ought not to je&s;t in the pari&s;h church|yard of the palace, as he is plea&s;ed to call it; that a little curio&s;ity in POLLONIUS was not a crime of magnitude enough to de&s;erve death; and that the King certainly bids the cannon &s;ound before the in|vention of gunpowder. I'll admit all the&s;e foils that the diamond may appear more brilliant; but, when I have done &s;o, will the &s;oure&s;t critic who has malignantly enjoyed this di&s;covery lay his hand on his heart, nay, would VOLTAIRE him&s;elf with his hundred and twenty volumes, were he alive, and &s;ay that he would not rather be known by the tra|gedy of <HI>Hamlet</HI> alone, with all its faults, than his own productions, with all their perfections.</P>
<P>I will not undertake to &s;ay, in a general &s;en&s;e, that this is a fair way of arguing. Have the faults or perfections of other men any thing to do with this particular object of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion? And, if I admit they exi&s;t, how can I who profe&s;s my&s;elf a warm admirer of SHAKESPEAR, for as to an advocate he needs none, get rid of an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact? I do not want to get rid of it. I even blazoned it here
<PB N="56" REF="54">
to &s;hew its in&s;ignificance; to &s;hew how much oftener it has been mentioned than it ought, and how greatly it has been magnified, when the other fact, one would think more worthy their attention as candid and &s;ound critics, of the inumerable and exqui&s;ite beauties this faulty piece contains, obtains their ac|knowledgment in &s;o painful and laboured a manner that every extorted confe&s;&s;ion gives them a heart burn, and chokes their faint prai&s;e in its utterance.</P>
<P>Perhaps the&s;e gentlemen were charitable enough to notice the blemi&s;hes of SHAKESPEAR becau&s;e an enumeration of his perfections was unnece&s;&s;ary. It mu&s;t be &s;o; for, otherwi&s;e, what a &s;tain to their truth, and what a drawback on their reputation it mu&s;t have been that, while men of competent ta|lents, the lawgivers of literature pa&s;s over &s;uch ex|cellence, it would be known, felt, and under&s;tood, by every other man in the kingdom, however illi|terate. Let us then imitate their charity, and &s;up|po&s;e this to be the ca&s;e; and then a criterion will be e&s;tabli&s;hed, rather an Iri&s;h one to be &s;ure, that that the be&s;t way of finding out a man's merit is to &s;earch for his defects.</P>
<P>For my own part, I am &s;o content to take things as find them; and, have &s;o much plea&s;ure in re|peating over and over again what I like, that again&s;t
<PB N="57" REF="55">
all pre&s;ident, I &s;hall not &s;cruple to revive in my mind, by an examination of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> that delight I have &s;o frequently and &s;o warmly enjoyed. All men agree on the value of a guinea, the beauty of a fine day, the odour of a ro&s;e; nor does a repetition of the enjoyment re&s;ulting from their admiration abate, for it rather encrea&s;es the grateful &s;atisfaction. Upon this principle I &s;hall undertake a very wel|come ta&s;k; nor &s;hall I, becau&s;e my guinea may be a little &s;hort of weight, my day ob&s;cured by a pa&s;&s;ing cloud, or my ro&s;e armed with a few thorns, deduct from the real value of either, but fairly revel in all the plea&s;ures their be&s;t qualities are ca|pable of affording me.</P>
<P>In the conduct of <HI>Hamlet,</HI> SHAKESPEAR &s;eems more to have treated a &s;ubject than to have con|&s;tructed a play. Nothing can be finer, more moral, more intere&s;ting than the general de&s;ign, and, in the choice of it, is evinced a great mind, a &s;trong di&s;|crimination, and a correct cla&s;&s;ical judgment. The ground work is that fir&s;t of all moral obligations, &s;ilial piety, and the feelings belonging to that pa&s;&s;ion, known to all hearts, and under&s;tood by all ranks are rou&s;ed by every &s;ituation in which the mo&s;t fertile imagination and the mo&s;t con&s;ummate art could have placed them.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="56">HAMLET, finding his father prematurely cut off by the hand of death, a father dear to his family, beloved by his &s;ubjects, and an honour to humanity; would, in rea&s;on and religion, have found a con&s;o|lation, and have reconciled him&s;elf to this lo&s;s, dreadful and irreparable as it was, as a natural ca|&s;ualty, and the will of that being, in who&s;e hands are the lives of us all, did not a &s;ecret admonition warn him that all was not right; but this &s;u&s;picion, diffi|cult to be cheri&s;hed in a noble mind, requires &s;trong circum&s;tances to confirm it. His mother's wedding with his uncle, that followed &s;o hard upon the death of his father, though it excites his horror, does not exhibit &s;ufficient proof of a crime which &s;eems too abominable for belief; and this credulity on the &s;ide of virtue is the mo&s;t beautiful feature in the character of HAMLET.</P>
<P>Under the influence of this conflict is HAMLET mo&s;t judiciou&s;ly introduced as the only mourner in his uncle's &s;plendid court. With this grief the mo|ther is made unfeelingly to reproach him; hypo|critically repre&s;enting it as the breach of a religious duty which, had &s;he been &s;incere, would have been a fact. HAMLET, though not per&s;uaded, is over|ruled; and in this &s;tate he is left alone to examine his mind, and out of charity, if po&s;&s;ible, to find a motive for the &s;trange and unnatural conduct of his mother.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="57">Though no man ever threw action into &s;uch &s;trong &s;ituations as SHAKESPEAR, his &s;oliloquys are unque&s;tionably the fine&s;t part of his writings, and the fine&s;t of his &s;oliloquys are the deliberations of HAMLET. Being left alone, and feeling him&s;elf impelled to explore the bu&s;ine&s;s of his father's cruel death, and his mother's &s;udden and ince&s;tuous mar|riage, his mind &s;inks under the impending trial, and he wi&s;hes for annihilation rather than to undertake the awful ta&s;k.<Q><SP>

<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"but no more like my father than I to HERCULES."</Q>
The re&s;ult of this deliberation is that it cannot come to good; and while he is involved in a con&s;ideration of all the dreadful con&s;equences, likely to be &s;howered on the heads of this wicked pair, the fitte&s;t mood for the poet's purpo&s;e, HORATIO and MARCELLUS come to inform him that they have &s;een his father's gho&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="58">Nothing can be better prepared nor conducted than this &s;cene.

The cautious enquiries of HAMLET, his eagerne&s;s, his tenderne&s;s for his father, making HORATIO repeat over and over again how he looked, whether he was armed, and other fond circum&s;tances full of duty and re&s;pect, are in the be&s;t &s;tyle of dramatic manage|ment; till, at length, having a&s;certained the fact and felt the whole force of its importance, he ex|claims,

and then,

<P><PB N="61" REF="59">It now becomes a matter of bu&s;ine&s;s. He di&s;|patches his friends to wait for him; his &s;u&s;picions when alone grow &s;tronger and &s;tronger; he meets the gho&s;t; he is urged to revenge, the nature of his father's death is explained, and the powerful climax which this natural and gradual developement of &s;o material a circum&s;tance was meant to attain, comes out in the expre&s;&s;ion,
<Q><SP>

and &s;hews that, from the moment of his father's death, his &s;u&s;picions, which owing to his own noblene&s;s of heart he had unwillingly entertained, were in|fluenced by feelings which human nature could not controul.</P>
<P>As to the &s;cene of the gho&s;t, I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent enquire into the propriety of introducing a gho&s;t at all, nor examine the objections that have been made again&s;t it by the critics with Mr. VOL|TAIRE at their head, who, neverthele&s;s, was not content with bringing forward the gho&s;t of NINUS in his <HI>Semiramis,</HI> but he made him &s;talk forth at noon day, I &s;hall only &s;ay, that for the &s;ake of li|terature, to which this character is a &s;hining orna|ment, I am in common with many thou&s;ands very happy that SHAKESPEAR gave us this &s;ample of his incomparable abilities.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="60">Taking it for granted that the &s;cene between HAMLET and the gho&s;t is as natural as any thing el&s;e, I &s;hall venture a word as to its drift and ope|ration. When the awful novelty of his father's re|appearance has a little &s;ub&s;ided, when fa&s;cinating terror has given way to manly re&s;olution, and the gho&s;t finds HAMLET <Q REND="inline">"apt,"</Q> the horrid &s;tory comes out and he is told that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if he has nature in him not to bear it."</Q>
This he mo&s;t &s;olemnly vows and de|clares that, for the purpo&s;e of entertaining and practi&s;ing revenge, he &s;hall wipe away from his brain all trivial fond records.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be his motive, which is &s;aid to be a &s;hallow one, for his conduct to OPHELIA. It does not, however, de&s;erve &s;o much reprehen&s;ion as it has received. The bu&s;ine&s;s of HAMLET is to be thought mad, which di&s;po&s;ition, as he calls it, he puts on that he may the better a&s;k tho&s;e &s;ort of odd que&s;tions which, by being &s;atirically thrown in may obtain for him by their &s;hrewdne&s;s and ambiguity, &s;uch an&s;wers as may corroborate the intelligence he has received from the gho&s;t; and what can &s;o &s;ub&s;tantially confirm the opinion of tho&s;e around him that he is mad, as outrageous behaviour to her he mo&s;t loves, a thing generally under&s;tood as a cri|tetion of infanity.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="61">In fact, from the milkine&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, and that &s;trong &s;en&s;e of his moral duty that every where mark his character, he pants for better proofs than tho&s;e he has already received through the means of a &s;upernatural agent; and, when he finds that chance has thrown in his way an opportunity, through the medium of the players, of &s;earching the matter to the quick, his mind is materially re|lieved from his fears le&s;t he &s;hould have li&s;tened to a fiend who came to practice on his melancholy, and tempt him on to damn him&s;elf; and, to clear up this doubt, he is determined to have grounds more relative.</P>
<P>In his progre&s;s to this point, how a&s;toni&s;hingly has the poet, in HAMLET's different &s;oliloquys, in his &s;cenes with POLONIUS, with ROSENCRAUS and GUILDENSTERN, and with the players, indulged him&s;elf in all that beauty and exqui&s;ite variety of which he alone was capable.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. SHAKESPEAR's PLAYS CONTINUED.</HEAD>
<P><HI>King John,</HI> one of tho&s;e plays which have largely contributed to the general celebrity of SHAKES|PEAR, was produced in 1596. There is a boldne&s;s and a &s;trength in this tragedy which has &s;erved to hand down the character of the times both faithfully and meritoriou&s;ly, and &s;hewn how greatly the dramatic hi&s;torian, through the vehicle of repre&s;entation, has the advantage of him who merely narrates.</P>
<P>JOHN him&s;elf is portrayed in a mo&s;t ma&s;terly and commanding manner, and will ever remain a &s;triking le&s;&s;on to all monarchs how to &s;teer between the extremes of weakne&s;s and wickedne&s;s. The &s;cene with HUBERT has often been con&s;idered as one of the fine&s;t ornaments of the Engli&s;h language. Indeed it is difficult to &s;ay what part of its conduct mo&s;t demands our admiration. The tampering with the half villain HUBERT, the dread that the crime
<PB N="67" REF="65">
has been actually committed, and at length laying the blame upon the in&s;trument, and even catching at the excu&s;e of having &s;een the a&s;&s;a&s;in in his look, are powerful &s;trokes.</P>
<P>The gallant, noble, and carele&s;s FAUCOMBRIDGE is a mo&s;t happy portrait, and &s;peaks for it&s;elf as a true likene&s;s of RICHARD COEUR de LION. That mixture of courage and levity, which is &s;o faithfully the character of the &s;oldier, no one ever knew how to depict like SHAKESPEAR; and, notwith&s;tanding the critics, we have here a proof that he would have found no difficulty in continuing MERCUTIO to the la&s;t act, who is perfectly FAUCONBRIDGE, except the roughne&s;s and the blunt hone&s;ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a di&s;crimination that we always find mo&s;t critically attended to in SHAKESPEAR. Honour and hone&s;ty, e&s;&s;entially mean the &s;ame thing. The offence of both con&s;i&s;ts in &s;hunn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ng meanne&s;s and every other contemptible quality; but there is a peculiar frank|ne&s;s belonging to hone&s;ty with which honour may di&s;pen&s;e, and here is an erect dignity in honour which hone&s;ty is uncon&s;cious of. In &s;hort hone&s;ty is plain, and honour p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">&s;hed. This is the di&s;tinction &s;o happily hit in the characters of MERCUTIO and FAUCONBRIDGE. Both are hone&s;t, both are honourable; but let the mind chu&s;e the appropriate epithet to di&s;tingui&s;h them &s;ingly, and we &s;hall give hone&s;tly to FAUCONBRIDGE, and honour to MERCUTIO.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The other characters in this play are well &s;u&s;|tained, and SHAKESPEAR merits the thanks of po&s;|terity
<PB N="68" REF="66">
for bringing us intimately acquainted with that weak and wicked monarch, from who&s;e vice and folly, as light i&s;&s;ues out of darkne&s;s, or a calm be|comes more lovely from a contemplation of the &s;torm that preceded it, originated Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights.</P>
<P><HI>Richard the Second</HI> was performed in 1597. This play is &s;u&s;pected to have been only revi&s;ed by SHAKESPEAR. Certainly we cannot trace in it his u&s;ual force, either as to the characters or the lan|guage. The probability is that it was written in a hurry, which by the way is no excu&s;e, and, as the circum&s;tances are wholly taken from the hi&s;torians and chroniclers of that day, many pa&s;&s;ages may have been literally tran&s;planted from the hi&s;tory to the play. This having been done, the &s;ubject was found &s;o unproductive that the author never thought it worth his while to fini&s;h it; and then the utmo&s;t we can &s;ay is that SHAKESPEAR was to blame for letting a play come forward unworthy of his re|putation.</P>
<P>Alterations of this play have been frequently attempted but always without &s;ucce&s;s. One of the&s;e was by THEOBALD, who dedicated his piece to the earl of ORRERY, from whom he received a hundred pounds in a hand&s;ome &s;nuff box. Thus moths live
<PB N="69" REF="67">
upon books. If men can write why dont they produce books them&s;elves.</P>
<P>That SHAKESPEAR took very little pains with <HI>Richard the Second</HI> is the more probable from his having produced <HI>Richard the Third</HI> in the &s;ame year; a bold and mo&s;t extraordinary production. Perhaps there never was &s;o prominent a character produced as this, nor one thrown into &s;uch a variety of po&s;itions, every one calculated to accompli&s;h the end of truth and ju&s;tice, by warning the &s;pectators again&s;t the dreadful effects of inordinate pride, and lawle&s;s ambition.</P>
<P>RICHARD ma&s;ters all hearts, and controuls all minds; working to his purpo&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions and foi|bles of mankind at his plea&s;ure. He admini&s;ters to the pride of BUCKINGHAM; and, not only by that means accompli&s;h his ends, but makes him an in&s;trument in his own downfall. He &s;o avails him&s;elf of the vanity of lady ANN that &s;he con&s;ents to do the very thing &s;he dreads, and what &s;he knows mu&s;t prove her de&s;truction. What can be &s;uch a ma&s;ter piece as this &s;cene? On the very &s;pot where &s;he ac|companies her hu&s;band towards his grave, &s;he con|&s;ents to marry his murderer; and yet is this extra|ordinary change wrought in &s;o artful a manner that
<PB N="70" REF="68">
the mo&s;t fa&s;tidious critic will not venture to pro|nounce it unnatural. Well may he exclaim
<Q><SP>
<L>" So mourned the dame of EPHESUS her love."</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>In this manner, off or on the &s;cene, is he through|out the play pre&s;ent to the imagination; till, at length, having, like the Devil he &s;erves, left all tho&s;e to that fate to which his craft has lured them, he becomes the wor&s;t tool in his own mi&s;erable plot; the feeling at the fall of the re&s;t being pity, that at his fall execration.</P>
<P>Throughout the&s;e and other in&s;tances, with which this play is replete, has SHAKESPEAR mo&s;t artfully warned his &s;pectators, not only again&s;t vil|lainly it&s;elf but al&s;o the ri&s;k and danger of conniving at it. Many of the in&s;truments of RICHARD, de|ceived by his hypocri&s;y, are tempted to &s;werve from rectitude in hopes to work his conver&s;ion. Here has our poet &s;hewn him&s;elf a ma&s;ter in his art. The be&s;t motive in the world is no excu&s;e for committing a po&s;itive wrong; but the play is known and re|peated by heart; and it is a fact notorious to every one that there is no in&s;tance upon record of any thing which has &s;o forcibly operated with the En|gli&s;h nation to create a rooted aver&s;ion to tyranny as this very tragedy.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="69">Having noticed the production of <HI>Richard the Second,</HI> and &s;o extraordinary a play as <HI>Richard the Third</HI> in the &s;ame year, will it not appear a&s;toni&s;h|ing that it &s;hould al&s;o produce the fir&s;t part of <HI>Henry the Fourth;</HI> a play, be it for character, &s;ituation, writing, conduct, or any other dramatic requi&s;ite, that cannot be &s;ufficiently extolled. It is full of beautiful and rich nature from the beginning to the end; where, except in SHAKESPEAR, have met to|gether &s;o many characters, &s;o correctly natural, &s;o &s;trongly coloured, and &s;o judiciou&s;ly contra&s;ted.</P>
<P>The bold, yet apprehen&s;ive HENRY, who in plau&s;ibly maintaining the crown he had u&s;urped, fan|cies that it totters on his head; his volatile &s;on who &s;eems to be the &s;courge of his father's crime, but who has native honour enough in the end to correct the le|vity and folly of the Prince of Wales in the dignity and honour of the King of ENGLAND and FRANCE; the noble natured HOTSPUR, meditating revenge again&s;t the man whom he had rai&s;ed to a throne, and who ungratefully &s;purns tho&s;e offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance he no longer needs, a &s;erious le&s;&s;on to tho&s;e who even from the be&s;t motives &s;upport a wrong cau&s;e; the&s;e, as &s;trong and warm written characters, have a high and meritorious title to admiration.</P>
<P>What then &s;hall we &s;ay when we come to &s;peak
<PB N="72" REF="70">
of FALSTAFF? the mo&s;t inimitable character that ever was produced. Shall we any longer &s;ay that SHAKESPEAR could not have pur&s;ued the cha|racter of MERCUTIO? Let us &s;tay and &s;ee whether that can be po&s;&s;ibly be our opinion when we have followed the humourous knight through the braggart in this play, the morali&s;t in the &s;econd part of <HI>Henry the Fourth,</HI> the lover in the <HI>Merry Wives of Wind&s;or,</HI> and the knave in them all. The wit of FALSTAFF, or rather the broad humour which contains &s;ome|thing better than wit, is &s;o true, &s;o &s;triking, &s;o ir|re&s;i&s;tible, that the &s;evere&s;t cynic mu&s;t laugh and mu&s;t approve.</P>
<P>The &s;crapes he lies him into, and afterwards lies him&s;elf out of, ca&s;tigate the folly of lying by laughing at it to the highe&s;t pitch of perfection. But this humour, known &s;o well by all, and &s;o diffi|cult to be de&s;cribed by any, is every where electri|cal from the two men in buckram, onward to the de&s;cription of the ragged regiment, and fini&s;hing by the giving HOTSPUR a new wound in his thigh.</P>
<P>NYM, and BARDOLPH, and POINS, are al&s;o ad|mirably drawn; &s;o is the HOSTESS. The inci|dents are perfectly probable and extremely natural and the quelling HOTSPUR's rebellion makes out, as a hi&s;torical play, a very intere&s;ting cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="71"><HI>The Merchant of Venice</HI> came out the following year, and mo&s;t claims our attention; which the more we give it the more we &s;hall have cau&s;e for admira|tion, for the characters are perfectly natural, and draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> in a ma&s;terly manner, the writing is full of rare beauty and exqui&s;ite truth, and the conduct is cor|rect and judicious; for the virtue it protects is re|warded, and the rancour and revenge it expo&s;es are di&s;appointed and puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The characters are drawn in the mo&s;t glowing colours. The Jew is a&s;toni&s;hingly bold and vivid. His turbulent and un&s;atisfied pa&s;&s;ions are thrown into a conflicted tumult in every way of which they are &s;u&s;ceptible, and it is difficult to &s;ay where they are be&s;t agitated; whether in the meditated revenge on ANTONIO and his crafty bargain, in the &s;cene with TUBAL, chequered with alternate joy and vexation, or the trial, where his &s;anguinary hopes are lifted to the highe&s;t climax of expectation, to be &s;uddenly damped by di&s;appointment and di&s;may.</P>
<P>PORTIA is mo&s;t highly fini&s;hed. Genero&s;ity, native dignity, and greatne&s;s of mind are every where con&s;i&s;tently &s;een in her, from the ca&s;kets to the deci&s;ion again&s;t SHYLOCK; and the&s;e qualities are brought forward through the medium of unaf|fected
<PB N="74" REF="72">
&s;prightline&s;s, neat wit, and captivating elo|quence. The other characters all rank re&s;pectably; but the judgment of the author is particularly con|&s;picuous in their gradually declining in con&s;equence, the better to bring forward PORTIA and the Jew.</P>
<P>The writing of this play is full of beauty and &s;weetne&s;s, wit and humour, &s;trength and force. The ca&s;ket &s;cene is charmingly written; &s;o is the trial &s;cene, in which the celebrated eulogium on mercy is &s;o admirably introduced, &s;tamping by a &s;ingle trait, as it happens &s;o very frequently in SHAKES|PEAR, the fame of a poet. Nor can we conceive any think &s;weeter than the garden &s;cene of LORENZO and JESSICA, in which the charms of mu&s;ic are &s;o eloquently de&s;cribed; another &s;tanding quotation.</P>
<P>The words uttered by the Jew are throughout the whole play a&s;toni&s;hingly appropriate. It is one of tho&s;e many in&s;tances in SHAKESPEAR where every auditor, even of the meane&s;t intellectual in|telligence, becomes a correct critic and decides at once, that the character brought before him could not have &s;aid any more, nor any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>The comic part con&s;i&s;ts of that playfulne&s;s in which SHAKESPEAR delighted to wanton, and re|lieves the intere&s;t at intervals throughout the piece,
<PB N="75" REF="73">
from the &s;prightly GRATIANO to the trifling GOB|BOS; and thus the language is a natural and ea&s;y &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of every thing that can intere&s;t, plea&s;e, and divert.</P>
<P>As to the conduct of the Merchant of VENICE, we are willing not to look at it too critically, be|cau&s;e if we did we &s;hould lo&s;e much of our plea|&s;ure. The cruelty of the Jew is a bold, and for the &s;ake of humanity let us hope an unnatural cir|cum&s;tance, but it is &s;urely po&s;&s;ible; I don't argue particularly in a Jew, for we are actually told, how far truly I do not pretend to &s;ay, that it really hap|pened in a chri&s;tian; but, true or fal&s;e, natural or unnatural, if we agree to admit it, there is an end to objection.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been complained of that time and place are violated, and that the proper moment for the cata&s;trophe is at the end of the trial, and this la&s;t objection has &s;ome weight; but the conduct of this piece has one perfection which, perhaps, never was &s;o happily wrought before nor &s;ince, I mean the union of the two &s;tories; blended &s;o con&s;i&s;t|ently and brought about &s;o na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="5 letters">ly, that the trifling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> committed again&s;t time and place is much more than atoned for by this mo&s;t judicious attention
<PB N="76" REF="74">
to action. The unity SHAKESPEAR &s;eldom violated, which is infinitely more material than both the others put together.</P>
<P>Though I could every where dwell on the in|e&s;timable value of SHAKESPEAR's writings; yet as his pieces like tho&s;e of every other author are of cour&s;e unequal, it gives me plea&s;ure to examine more minutely &s;uch as are in the highe&s;t e&s;timation, though any candidate for dramatic fame might be content to &s;ub&s;i&s;t his reputation on the gleanings.</P>
<P>As <HI>All's Well that End's Well</HI> was one of three, &s;ome &s;ay four, plays, of which the <HI>Merchant of Venice</HI> was the fir&s;t that came out in the &s;ame year; it is not wonderful that it cannot rank with that admirable production. This, however, is in great mea&s;ure owing to its unfortunate plot; the an&s;wer to which is, that SHAKESPEAR out to have cho&s;en a better. There are, however, mo&s;t charming pa&s;&s;a|ges in this play, and &s;ome &s;trong and highly wrought circum&s;tances. The character of PAROLLES, which &s;eems to have &s;upplied the hint for BOBADIL, is in our delightful poet's be&s;t &s;tyle of humour; and from the mouth of HELEN we hear many of tho&s;e beautiful and fa&s;cinating pa&s;&s;ages which, in him, &s;pring from a &s;ource inexhau&s;tible.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="75"><HI>Sir John Oldca&s;tle</HI> is certainly not worthy to be ranked among the works of SHAKESPEAR, and it is with great propriety that it has been generally re|jected. It has, however, evident marks in places of &s;trong and &s;imilar genius, which might have ari&s;en from his having improved it; but even then they appear to be the &s;hadow of his writing rather than the writing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be &s;trongly confirmed by his bring|ing out in the &s;ame year <HI>The Second Part of Henry the Fourth;</HI> a play replete with wonderful writing. In this re&s;pect the character of FALSTAFF is even improved; for, though he is full of rich and lux|urious humour in the former part of this &s;ubject, his ob&s;ervations here have a pointed and deep &s;ubtilty which &s;eems to have been improved by keener and maturer ob&s;ervation. In &s;hort, he is a thief in the fir&s;t part, and a &s;windler in the &s;econd. Characters that require very different qualifications, though they are the &s;ame in principle.</P>
<P>The &s;ituations al&s;o that he is thrown into are &s;tronger and richer. The &s;cene with DOLL TEAR|SHEET is highly wrought, &s;o is that with SHALLOW and SILENCE, from his dry examination of the re|cruits, onward to his art in borrowing the thou&s;and
<PB N="78" REF="76">
pounds, and at la&s;t his ex&s;tacy at receiving from PISLOL the news of the king's death.</P>
<P>All the companions of FALSTAFF are al&s;o greatly heightened in this play, which is every where warm with incidents of the happie&s;t invention, and full of characters both intere&s;ting and entertain|ing; &s;hewing not more the fertility than the judgment with which SHAKESPEAR's a&s;toni&s;hing mind was fraught, and through which he delineated the features of human nature at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the following year came out <HI>Henry the Fifth,</HI> another wonderful production; but, indeed, every thing is wonderful in SHAKESPEAR. To recom|pence the auditor for the lo&s;s of FALSTAFF, the author has introduced FLUELLEN, who&s;e mixture of pride, quaintne&s;s, and courage, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to re&s;pect, and laugh at. PISTOL is in this play a fir&s;t rate part, and indeed all the characters and incidents in the comic part are in the true&s;t vein of plea&s;antry.</P>

<P><HI>Much Ado about Nothing</HI> came out in the &s;ame
<PB N="80" REF="78">
year. This play is &s;o witty, &s;o playful, &s;o abundant in &s;trong writing, and rich humour, that it has always attracted univer&s;al applau&s;e. The beauties it contains are innumerable, they are a clu&s;ter, and are &s;et &s;o thick that they &s;carcely afford one another relief, and yet the be&s;t critic would find it difficult to &s;ay which of them ought to be di&s;placed.</P>
<P>BENEDICK and BEATRICE, have created the leading characters in fifty comedies, and yet have never been excelled, not even by CONGREVE. Their friendly &s;parring con&s;i&s;ts of that extempora|neous repartee, which is better than wit, becau&s;e it is not &s;tudied, and better than humour becau&s;e it is not gro&s;s. In &s;hort what was genuine in SHAKES|PEAR by others has only been imitated, and there is one circum&s;tance relative to the&s;e characters which boa&s;ts con&s;iderable pre-eminence, becau&s;e all this wit, while its imitations have been introduced in general only to add a liveline&s;s to the &s;cene, is here the very pith and marrow of the plot, for it is the vehicle through which BENEDICK and BEA|TRICE, who had &s;eparately &s;worn to live &s;ingle, are actually made to fall in love with each other.</P>
<P>The critics, however, who cannot help nibbling, have endeavoured to repre&s;ent this wit are too licen|tious
<PB N="81" REF="79">
in BENEDICK, and too light in BEATRICE. In their &s;queami&s;h con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s, however, they forget that when the rein is thrown over the neck of wit it will be playful; but, &s;o it be not vicious, its curvettings ought to be pardoned. In the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e &s;o little is there of vice in the plea&s;antries of BENEDICK and BEATRICE, that they exhibit as exalted a picture of every quality that can con&s;ti|tute honour, genero&s;ity, and the noble nature of love and friend&s;hip, as, perhaps, the records of literature can furni&s;h.</P>
<P>There is not &s;imply conver&s;ation in the&s;e cha|racters, there is action; the be&s;t action: that which is intended to &s;erve truth and recommend morality. BEATRICE's friend&s;hip to her cou&s;in, and BENE|DICK's challenging CLAUDIO, are among the grand|e&s;t and noble&s;t incidents the dramatic art has to boa&s;t of. The circum&s;tance of laying the &s;ame trap both for BENEDICK and BEATRICE has been cen&s;ured with &s;ome colour of truth, but it is materially varied, and after all not worth a &s;ingle cavil.</P>
<P>All the circum&s;tances of the plot have relation to one another. Even DOGBERRY and his watch, who&s;e natural humour ari&s;es from an affectation of u&s;ing phra&s;es he does not under&s;tand, which has
<PB N="82" REF="80">
been played upon by &s;o many authors from that time to this, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the con|&s;truction of the piece; for without them DON JOHN's plot could not have been defeated. In &s;hort this comedy di&s;plays a fund of beauty which has never failed to give uncea&s;ing delight to all ranks of auditors; and if it has faults, &s;o has nature, to whom SHAKESPEAR was &s;o faithful, and in whom the notable critics, if they took it in their heads, would undertake to di&s;cover as many imperfections as they have affected to find in her favourite.</P>
<P><HI>As You Like It,</HI> produced in the &s;ame year, differs at all points, except general merit, from <HI>Much ado about Nothing.</HI> It is as full of wit, of beauty, of &s;weetne&s;s, and of moral, but the &s;tyle of the characters, the conveyance of the matter, and the &s;cene of action are the difference, and &s;erve to &s;hew that SHAKESPEAR could create intere&s;t, with equal facility, in a court or a fore&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>As You Like It</HI> boa&s;ts one unrivalled merit, for it is a model for dramatic pa&s;torals, and in vain do we place by the &s;ide of it the be&s;t productions of TASSO and GUARINI. This gives the wit, with all its brilliancy, a melancholy and grave air; for it does not con&s;i&s;t of &s;allies in con&s;equence of re|flections in manners that actually pa&s;s before you,
<PB N="83" REF="81">
but rather of moralizing on tho&s;e which have pa&s;&s;ed, and from which you are di&s;tant both as to time and place.</P>
<P>To the reputation of an author, therefore, I know not if this &s;pecies of writing be not the truer advantage. There appears to be more mind and more effort in producing it, not, however, in SHAKESPEAR, for his writings &s;eem every where to have produced them&s;elves, the &s;en&s;ible and &s;trong ob&s;ervation in the &s;weet prattle of ROSALIND, the beauty and good &s;en&s;e in the reflexions of JAQUES, and the dry humour and true hone&s;ty in the faithful TOUCHSTONE, could not have been &s;hewn to ad|vantage in any other &s;ituations.</P>
<P>How many pa&s;&s;ages in this play are known by heart and con&s;idered of that memorable de&s;cription that I have had &s;uch frequent occa&s;ion to notice. Quotations from the mouths of ROSALIND, and TOUCHSTONE, are in the recollection of every one, and that celebrated &s;peech, known by the name of <HI>Shake&s;pear's Seven Ages,</HI> has been, time out of mind, bawled by men, and li&s;ped by children.</P>
<P>As to the plot of the play, it has by &s;ome been con&s;idered as romantic, but this certainly con&s;titutes
<PB N="84" REF="82">
its e&s;&s;ence; for without it we &s;hould lo&s;e the heroic friend&s;hip of CAELIA, and the blunt fidelity of TOUSHSTONE; be&s;ides, if the characters are thrown into extraordinary &s;ituations, it has not ari&s;en from choice but compul&s;ion, and, therefore, they do not enjoy fanciful plea&s;ure ab&s;urdly cho&s;en by them&s;elves, they make the be&s;t of their unfortu|nate &s;ituations, and endeavour to turn that trouble that has been forced upon them into plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In this light, nothing can be more intere&s;ting nor affecting than the plot of <HI>As You Like It.</HI> The very circum&s;tance of the ladies &s;o &s;uddenly giving away their hearts, which doctor JOHNSON does not &s;eem to approve, is by no means for &s;uch a plot improper. They want protectors. Be&s;ides there is a parity in the fortunes of ORLANDO and ROSALIND, that begets a very natural &s;ympathy, and renders the in|cident beautiful and affecting. I will agree, how|ever, with the doctor that it would have been a mo&s;t admirable advantage to literature if SHAKES|PEAR had taken an opportunity of exerting his ex|traordinary powers by writing a &s;cene between the Hermit and the U&s;urper.</P>
<P>The next play we &s;hall have to examine will be <HI>The Merry Wives of Wind&s;or,</HI> which came out in 1601. This piece, take it as fair unadulterated na|ture,
<PB N="85" REF="83">
con&s;i&s;ting exactly of the very materials which con&s;titute the be&s;t &s;pecies of true comedy, mu&s;t be &s;o pronounced at lea&s;t equal to any thing in the Engli&s;h language. Such a variety of characters, all true unexaggerated nature, without quaintne&s;s, with|out affectation, &s;peaking in the manner and to the very letter of real life, every one as nece&s;&s;ary to the plot as the various compartments of a building, ju&s;t in proportion, e&s;&s;ential in utility, never better united together.</P>
<P>The plot is natural, &s;imple, and intere&s;ting; and, though an <HI>epi&s;ode</HI> grows out of it which begets much perplexity and true legitimate <HI>equivoque,</HI> no|thing from fir&s;t to la&s;t can be more per&s;picuous. Jealou&s;y has never been &s;o &s;trongly depicted, nor &s;o happily expo&s;ed to ridicule. The very blind|ne&s;s of FORD in being gulled out of his money and his &s;en&s;es by FALSTAFF, is in the happie&s;t ex|treme of true comedy; and though we have &s;een complaints that the &s;ituations of the &s;cenes might be tran&s;po&s;ed, and that the play might have been ended almo&s;t at any part of it, yet it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay that this could have been done with effect, becau&s;e the repetition of the &s;uppo&s;ed provocation is the very paroxy&s;m in which the fever finds a cure for it&s;elf; for otherwi&s;e, in SHAKESPEAR's own
<PB N="86" REF="84">
words in another place, it would but
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;kin and film the ulcerous part."</Q></P>
<P>We have al&s;o been told of FORD's ab&s;urdity in con&s;idering FALSTAFF as an object of jealou&s;y; but who that knows the blindne&s;s of that pa&s;&s;ion will not con&s;ider this as the cunning of the &s;cene. Mrs. FORD's ground is &s;ecure. She places a con|fidence in a valuable and approving friend, and the more loo&s;ely her conduct appears to her hu&s;band the &s;tronger is &s;ure to be his remor&s;e when he finds an amiable wi&s;e has conde&s;cended to go &s;uch lengths to cure him of his ungrateful &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>As to the epi&s;ode, in which all the &s;ubordinate characters are concerned, it is &s;trongly interwoven with all the main de&s;ign and the incidents that grow out of it are truly plea&s;ant and at the &s;ame time hold out a whole&s;ome moral.</P>
<P>As to the characters, the mo&s;t prominent of cour&s;e is FALSTAFF; though there is no &s;aying for the utility in their &s;ituations to which to give the preference. FALSTAFF is mo&s;t happily hit, even in the difficult light in which he is placed. We are told that queen ELIZABETH commanded SHAKES|PEAR to make FAISTAFF in love. It has been
<PB N="87" REF="85">
well ob&s;erved by doctor JOHNSON that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a man does not with great facility write to the ideas of another, and that love was not in FALSTAFF's na|ture."</Q>
SHAKESPEAR has, however, from his gro&s;s vanity, from his avarice, from his cunning, conjured up &s;omething much better than love in FALSTAFF, for he has made him fancy Mrs. FORD in love with him, which is truer comedy. This, his abu&s;e of what he fancies confidence in her, and his admini&s;|tering to the plea&s;ure of FORD under the name of BROOK, employ all the pa&s;&s;ions proper to FAL|STAFF, and at la&s;t make him the gro&s;&s;e&s;t dupe in his own plot.</P>
<P>This is the very e&s;&s;ence of comedy; and, as it &s;erves to throw FALSTAFF into all tho&s;e &s;ituations which call forth his peculiar humour, may be con&s;idered in a mo&s;t felicitous light. Who can re&s;i&s;t the de&s;cription of his being &s;ou&s;ed in the THAMES. His reading the letter, and various other circum&s;tances. His lu&s;cious ideas, his voluptuous mind, his &s;en&s;ual pa&s;&s;ions are all di&s;played in the highe&s;t colouring, which &s;hews in a mo&s;t extra|ordinary manner the wonderful re&s;ources that were to be met with in the genius of SHAKESPEAR.</P>
<P>FORD is a jealous character di&s;tinctly different
<PB N="88" REF="86">
from any other in SHAKESPEAR, OTHELLO is pro|voked to by a villain, and from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own unworthine&s;s, IACHIMO from ab&s;ence and fictitious te&s;timony, TROILUS from a con|viction that his wife was a wanton, and the re&s;t from other motives; but FORD is jealous through pride and from a belief that a mo&s;t unworthy object is preferred to him. This, as there is nothing &s;o mean as jealou&s;y, though nothing &s;o much to be pitied, puts him upon &s;hifts which make him almo&s;t as contemptible as his rivial; and, under the tricks played him by the merry wives, as they are called, perfectly laudable; whereas, were there not this &s;trong provocation, Mr. FORD's conduct would be reprehen&s;ible, if not unpardonable. In &s;hort, SHAKESPEAR knew that this was the only &s;pecies of jealou&s;y that could po&s;&s;ibly be laughed at, and, therefore, with that knowledge of human nature that has every where di&s;tingui&s;hed him, he has made it the ground work of &s;o entertaining and laudable a plot, that no portrait of jealou&s;y has &s;ince been drawn but this comedy has &s;itten for &s;ome of the features.</P>
<P>I could with great plea&s;ure go over the partilar merits of the other characters, they are &s;o various, and &s;o admirable; but it would only be de&s;cribing
<PB N="89" REF="87">
what every body knows, both in their own forms and in the imitations of them that have pervaded &s;o many other productions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been ob&s;erved that SHAKESPEAR &s;eems to have been original in characters that are particularly marked by foreign and provincial pronunciation, but that the merit of &s;uch characters is in the actor and not in the writer. This is the &s;trange&s;t of all a&s;&s;ertions, and I &s;hould not have noticed it had not the authority been re&s;pectable. The actor can do nothing if nothing is given him. Welchmen may &s;putter, Iri&s;hmen &s;peak the brogue, and Frenchmen clip Engli&s;h to all eternity, but this is not enough, it is the wit and humour conveyed by this vehicle and not the vehicle it&s;elf that begets attention, and though I have often &s;een actors who can from their excellent merit make a little go a great way, I never yet &s;aw one who could make a great deal out of nothing.</NOTE>, I &s;hall, therefore, apologize for every word I have written on the &s;ubject of this admirable play, becau&s;e every word, in truth, in rea&s;on, in public opinion, and in notoriety, is to|tally unnece&s;&s;ary; &s;o well does the heart know how to de&s;pi&s;e critici&s;m where the auditor has only to hear and admire.</P>
<P><HI>Henry the Eighth</HI> was al&s;o performed in 1601, and gives us another proof that there was nothing too mighty for the gra&s;p of our poet's genius. This is the la&s;t of SHAKESPEAR's hi&s;torical plays, and is evidently written in compliment to queen ELIZA|BETH. I cannot be of doctor JOHNSON's opinion
<PB N="90" REF="88">
that the genius of SHAKESPEAR in this play comes in and goes out with KATHERINE, and that every other part may be ea&s;ily conceived and ea&s;ily writ|ten. The &s;pecimen of the true and intere&s;ting pa|thetic which SHAKESPEAR has given us in the cha|racter of KATHERINE is peculiarly admirable, and among the be&s;t efforts of his inimitable talents; but are WOLSEY and HENRY only common characters? Or are they what they have been univer&s;ally al|lowed, &s;trong, powerful, and dramatic. Does BUCKINGHAM go for nothing? And are &s;uch exqui&s;ite lines as he utters when he is led to execu|tion ea&s;ily conceived? I wi&s;h they were, if for no other rea&s;on than that we might comprehend that &s;ecret of writing with which nature entru&s;ted our delicious poet. But the lines, which in another place the doctor has applied to DRYDEN,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"that in a pointed &s;entence more regard is commonly had to the words than the thought,"</Q>
&s;eem to hit him here particularly hard; but, as I mean hereafter to examine this gentleman as one of the critics of SHAKESPEAR, I &s;hall content my&s;elf at pre&s;ent with &s;aying that the world and doctor JOHNSON are of different opinions.</P>
<P><HI>Cromwell</HI> is one of tho&s;e plays rejected as SHAKESPEAR's, and certainly with great rea&s;on, for it has upon the whole le&s;s of tho&s;e marks of his
<PB N="91" REF="89">
genius and judgment than any of tho&s;e pieces that have been merely attributed to him. That he had &s;ome concern in it, however, cannot be doubted.

<P><HI>Troilus and Cre&s;&s;ida,</HI> the la&s;t play SHAKESPEAR produced in the reign of ELIZABETH, came out in 1602. A great deal has been &s;aid to prove that this was written after CHAPMAN produced his <HI>Ver&s;ion of</HI> HOMER, a fact by no means, however, &s;ub|&s;tantiated, or, indeed, if it were, would it materially alter the que&s;tion, for SHAKESPEAR and CHAP|MAN were not exactly of equal merit<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I think it pretty nearly amounts to a proof that SHAKESPEAR knew the Trojan War before CHAPMAN's <HI>Homer,</HI> by many pa&s;&s;ages in his works. For one in&s;tance he makes PISTOL &s;ay, &s;hall I Sir PANDARUS of TROY become?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEAR mu&s;t &s;ome how certainly have read the hi&s;tory of the Trojan War, perhaps, from CAXTON, and became intimately acquainted with
<PB N="92" REF="90">
the various qualities of the Grecian generals, for he has drawn their characters with full as much beauty and truth as HOMER, and one is apt to think that he only read the hi&s;tory and knew nothing of HOMER's particular manner of treating it; for, though the characters are the &s;ame, and may be known through the portraiture of both authors as likene&s;&s;es, there is a dignity and a &s;ublimity in the manner of their ex|pre&s;&s;ing their &s;entiments in this play, beyond any thing of that nature in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and is &s;o much better at any rate than a tran&s;lation, that without greci&s;ms the characters are critically Greeks, a di&s;crimination that SHAKESPEAR under&s;tood better than any au|thor that ever lived.</P>
<P>As to the other merits of this play, they are va|rious, but they are irregular and ha&s;tily put together. CRESSIDA and PANDARUS are characters vio|lently drawn, but they beget that &s;overeign and in|effable dete&s;tation of vice which it is the pecu|liar duty of the dramatic poet to excite. The bru|tality of THERSITES is well thrown in to mortify the wanton CRESSIDA, and the conduct in ISOI|LUS's detection of her fal&s;ehood and wickedne&s;s is ma&s;terly.</P>
<P>With this play I &s;hall at pre&s;ent take leave of SHAKESPEAR to look after his cotemporaries; la|menting
<PB N="93" REF="91">
my inability to do him ju&s;tice except in my feelings and my wi&s;hes, yet grateful for an op|portunity of expatiating on a theme which affords me the plea&s;ure of paying a tribute of re&s;pect, and admiration, to great, and extraordinary talents.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. JONSON.</HEAD>
<P>IN the li&s;t of tho&s;e dramatic poets who were cele|brated in the reigns of ELIZABETH and JAMES the Fir&s;t, JONSON claims immediate rank after SHAKESPEAR; and it is but fair to &s;ay that the &s;trong &s;en&s;e and &s;ober regularity of his writings were of infinite con&s;equence to tho&s;e other authors of that time, who&s;e pens, unlike the pen of SHAKES|PEAR, which never ventured in vain, required a ma&s;terly criterion for their regulation, &s;uch as JON|SON knew how to &s;et up.</P>
<P>Of this u&s;e was this &s;choolma&s;ter in literature, who&s;e pupils very often would have run riot had he not held up the rod of critici&s;m perpetually <HI>in terrorem.</HI> Not that JONSON did not know nature as well as erudition, for we have many &s;triking proofs in his dramatic writings that he did; but it was awk|ward
<PB N="95" REF="93">
nature, dry nature, &s;ententious nature, nature in &s;tilts and trammels; and, though faithful to truth as truth is to perfection, the proper proportion of amu&s;ement and in&s;truction was mi&s;taken, and the force of improvement was un&s;ounded in that ta&s;te|le&s;s, and often nau&s;eous vehicle, through which it was meant to be conveyed.</P>
<P>It might be invidious to place JONSON by the &s;ide of SHAKESPEAR, becau&s;e the lo&s;s to him in the compari&s;on would be infinite. It is indi&s;pen&s;i|ble, however, to notice, becau&s;e it is a hi&s;torical fact that he had the experience of nine years, during which time SHAKESPEAR was licking the &s;tage into form, before he brought forward a &s;ingle piece; and, this premi&s;ed, whatever the world in general may think of the matter, SHAKESPEAR mu&s;t have been the preceptor of JONSON.</P>
<P>We are told, indeed, that SHAKESPEAR fo&s;tered him and his works, and with &s;ome difficulty &s;o wrought his iron that at la&s;t it became maleable and a&s;&s;umed &s;omething like form; and we are al&s;o told that he was very ungrateful in return for this kind|ne&s;s; which circum&s;tance, if true, carries with it a proof of that remark which may invariably be ven|tured, that genius is naturally allied to liberality, and pedantry to envy.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="94">Indeed the whole life of JONSON &s;eems to have been a &s;eries of pride, meanne&s;s, &s;ourne&s;s, in&s;olence, and di&s;content<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How arrogantly ungrateful was his me&s;&s;age to CHARLES the Fir&s;t, who advanced him as poet laureat, and frequently loaded him with benefits; one of which, a hundred pounds, is acknowledged in an epigram. The king &s;ent him ten guineas upon hearing that he was poor. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"His maje&s;ty,"</Q> &s;aid JONSON to the bearer,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he &s;ent me ten guineas becau&s;e I am poor and live in an alley. Tell him his &s;oul lives in an alley."</Q></NOTE>. Turbulence threw him into the army, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s made him quit the army for the &s;tage, brutality hurried him to take away the life of a fellow creature, and capriciou&s;ne&s;s induced him to change his religion, all which circum&s;tances are mentioned, however, here only to corroborate what has been before a&s;&s;erted that the different features in the mind of the man often operate upon the la|bours of the writer.</P>
<P>JONSON was educated at We&s;tmin&s;ter &s;chool under the celebrated CAMDEN; but the narrow ideas of his father-in-law, who was a bricklayer, and who &s;aw no further u&s;e for in&s;truction than the level and the &s;quare, induced him to take JONSON from that learning, which he is &s;aid to have imbibed with great avidity, to teach him his own trade that he thought would build him a more &s;olid fortune than the trade of poetry. The young gentleman, how|ever, who had more ta&s;te for building ca&s;tles in the
<PB N="97" REF="95">
air than hou&s;es upon terra firma, treated this in|tended kindne&s;s with great contempt, and, leaving his family, went into the army in FLANDERS.</P>
<P>The &s;tudy of literature was more congenial to the feelings of JONSON than the &s;tudy of military tactics. He, therefore, took an early opportunity of leaving the army and repaired to CAMBRIDGE, where it &s;hould appear that he made no great &s;tay, owing to the narrowne&s;s of his finances, for we &s;oon find him an actor at the Curtain Theatre, Shore|ditch. Here, following the &s;teps of SHAKESPEAR, he tried his hand at writing plays, in which occupa|tion, however, he appears, for a time, to have been un&s;ucce&s;sful. At length he wrote <HI>Every Man in his Humour,</HI> a comedy beyond doubt of much &s;ter|ling excellence, and from that time his reputation began to be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>JONSON was perpetually &s;quabbling with all mankind, and among the re&s;t with SHAKESPEAR; who, in his own words, might have replied with perfect indifference,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Till thou can'&s;t rail the &s;eal from off the bond."</Q>
The&s;e, probably, might have been his &s;entiments, for we do not find that he conde&s;cended to notice a &s;lander that was born of ingratitude, and nur&s;ed by envy. JONSON did

not every where, however, fare &s;o well; for &s;ome of his malice drew on him a quarrel which fini&s;hed by his killing a man in a duel, for which he was im|pri&s;oned; but he procured his relea&s;e by changing his religion; and thus he exhibited that picture which, whatever merit it might have had, was not even in the lea&s;t degree like true genius, for it was wi&s;dom dre&s;&s;ed like folly, knowledge hid by vanity, and talents obliterated by arrogance; pre&s;enting at once a mind, powerful, mean, offen&s;ive, overbearing, and accommodating.</P>
<P>The different pieces which JONSON produced amount to about fifty-three in number, be&s;ides one or two which are attributed to him; but among the&s;e are only two tragedies, and ten comedies, the re&s;t being either ma&s;ques, or comic &s;atires, or el&s;e &s;ketches written to &s;erve &s;ome temporary purpo&s;e, and this &s;tatement alone may &s;erve to &s;hew how completely the works of JONSON kick the beam when poi&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e of SHAKESPEAR.</P>
<P>Yet was his merit great and exten&s;ive, and he &s;hall be allowed it to the letter, for it is not in his want of &s;ufficient talents, for one man, that we di&s;|cover the di&s;parity; it is in his rival's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the talents of twenty men.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="97">As to tragedy, JONSON is ab&s;olutely an Engli&s;h SENECA, but a much better writer. <HI>Sejanus</HI> has great virile &s;trength, and &s;ound &s;terling merit; but it is heavy, dull, and declamatory, and le&s;t any &s;chool boy &s;hould be mi&s;taken as to its origin, the author has been hone&s;t enough to &s;hew in what way he has quoted the ancients, even to &s;etting down all his authorities; &s;o that the fall of <HI>Sejanus,</HI> whatever it may be as a prompt-book, cannot be denied the merit of an excellent &s;chool-book.</P>

<P><PB N="100" REF="98">Some of the comedies of JONSON, however, have di&s;tingui&s;hed merit. <HI>Every Man in his Humour</HI> is admirably con&s;tructed, well managed, and full of tho&s;e characters which are the propere&s;t objects of comedy. I will not invidiou&s;ly &s;ay that the out|line of many of the parts may ea&s;ily be traced. <HI>The Braggart. The Jealous Man. The Simpleton.</HI> and <HI>The Plain Dealer,</HI> are fair and obvious game, and one poet has as great a right to pur&s;ue them as an|other. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that KITELY and BOBOADIL in this play are ma&s;terly characters, and the means taken to cure the folly of the one and and puni&s;h the cowardice of the other are well pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The &s;ubordinate characters through a very na|tural epi&s;ode in which they are them&s;elves con|cerned contribute to bring about the cata&s;trophe, in which nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s the proteus BRAINWORM is very active. This rounds the conduct &s;o art|fully that no per&s;onage, even to COB and TIB,
<PB N="101" REF="99">
is foi&s;ted in, but all contribute very poetically to aid the double plot.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the merits of this play, to which, in|deed. may be added the adroit manner in which JONSON has fitted a foreign &s;ubject to the Engli&s;h &s;tage. for the original plot is Italian, which may very ea&s;ily be di&s;cerned by the conduct of the intriguing BRAINWORM. As it is managed however here, no|thing can be more vernacular than the humour, the manners, and the intrigue, and yet, with all the&s;e ad|vantages, it has been with the utmo&s;t difficulty that this play has been able to keep ground; nor would it ever have held a reputable &s;ituation on the &s;tage had it not occa&s;ionally revived through a union of uncommon talents.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of this is obvious. Perfect wit and cha&s;te humour, as they are called, may be natural but they cannot be general, and nothing but what is general can univer&s;ally plea&s;e. The public do not want an author to write a play as if every &s;entence obnoxious to critici&s;m was a wound in his repu|tation; they would rather that he greatly &s;ucceeded in places even though he &s;ometimes relaxed; and why? Becau&s;e this is human nature, of which a a play ought to be the faithful repre&s;entative; and it is on this account that the hard, dry, though na|tural
<PB N="102" REF="100">
humour of JONSON, and the refined and po|li&s;hed wit of CONGREVE, though they beget parti|cular admiration, never attract general applau&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Every Man in his Humour</HI> is a chimerical in|&s;tance of JONSON's eccentricity as a playwright. It has in it &s;ome admirable writing, and the cha|racters are well drawn, but it is conveyed to the audience through the medium of a grex, or &s;et of &s;uppo&s;ed auditors, who &s;it on the &s;tage and explain what if it were properly written ought to explain it&s;elf. By this means the per&s;onages &s;mack off the old moralities and become pa&s;&s;ions rather than cha|racters; and thus JONSON, in&s;tead of bringing the &s;tage forward has rather endeavoured to throw it behind hand, and given one proof among many that, though he has much merit of every de&s;cription, yet it con&s;i&s;ts rather of di&s;tracted and &s;eparate parts, than a &s;ober and harmonious whole.</P>
<P>As <HI>Sejanus</HI> and the&s;e two comedies were all the dramatic pieces, except &s;ome of his ma&s;ques, that JONSON produced before the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t, by which time SHAKESPEAR had brought out twenty-four regular plays, I &s;hall defer any farther mention of this author till I have brought his co|temporaries up to that period and a general account of the &s;tage it&s;elf and every regulation concerning it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. CHAPMAN, THOMAS HEYWOOD, MARLOE, AND OTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>CHAPMAN in his way was a mo&s;t extraordinary character. I &s;hall not in relation to this author or any other exhibit any particular anxiety as to the town where he fir&s;t drew his breath, the college that boa&s;ted the honour of his education, or any other of tho&s;e adventitious circum&s;tances which by &s;ome biographers are con&s;idered as of much greater moment than whether they credited the place of their birth, or the &s;eminary where they were edu|cated.</P>
<P>CHAPMAN, whoever were his ance&s;tors, or wherever he was born, was a great credit to litera|ture, as far as correct cla&s;&s;ical knowledge can ren|der an author celebrated. He was born &s;even years before SHAKESPEAR; and began, as a &s;cholar, to be in full reputation very early in life. His fir&s;t
<PB N="104" REF="102">
play, however, did not make its appearance till the very year JONSON brought out <HI>Every Man in his Humour;</HI> therefore I can only notice in this place that, which was called <HI>The Blind Beggar of Alex|andria,</HI> and another produced the following year, under the title of <HI>The Humerores Day's Mirth,</HI> as the third dramatic effort of this author did not make its appearance till two years after the death of ELIZABETH.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, however, before I &s;peak of his plays, claim a right to mention CHAPMAN generally as an author; and it is not becau&s;e I have in another place in&s;i&s;ted that he is greatly inferior to SHAKES|PEAR, for indeed who is not? That I am to afford him only a niggardly portion of prai&s;e; for he was a formidable rival to JONSON, who took him by the hand as a friend, the more &s;ecurely to do him every po&s;&s;ible kind of injury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One in&s;tance of this is apparent in the play of <HI>Ea&s;tward Hoe,</HI> which was thought when it came forward to be the &s;ole production of CHAPMAN. JONSON, however, is known to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in it and to have introduced &s;ome &s;arca&s;tic pa&s;&s;ages again&s;t the Scots; which, operating, as he wi&s;hed and expected, upon JAMES, pro|duced the downfall of CHAPMAN at court, where he had great ex|pectations through the influence of the Prince of WALES, and the Earl of SOMERSET. Not had he any opportunity of rein&s;tating him|&s;elf through any explanation, for the Prince &s;oon after died, and the Earl was di&s;graced.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="103">CHAPMAN was certainly both a correct and an ele|gant &s;cholar. His manners we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e poli&s;hed, he enjoyed the countenance and protection of the great, and was the intimate friend of men of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed wit and ingenuity of that time. His plays have con|&s;iderable merit, and &s;ome of his other works are by no means a draw back on his fame; but his be&s;t efforts are his tran&s;lations, particularly tho&s;e from HOMER, which were a great help at that period to erudition.</P>
<P>The two comedies, that regularly fall under our notice in this place, are the mo&s;t indifferent of this authors works; being neither divided into acts, nor having any regular d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">amatic con&s;truction. The ut|mo&s;t therefore, that can be &s;aid of them is that they bore marks of genius and nature in the writing, and gave expectation of better productions which were to follow.</P>
<P>THOMAS HEYWOOD who has been already menti|oned, and who like, his cotemporaries. HARDY in France, and LOPEZ de VEGA in Spain, &s;eems to have derived all his merit from the number in&s;tead of the quality of his dramatic works, demands &s;ome men|tion here, though no more than two of his plays, at
<PB N="106" REF="104">
lea&s;t that we know of, appeared during the life of ELIZABETH.</P>
<P>This man, by &s;ome of the biographers, has been greatly extolled as a writer without any great appearance, however, of either truth or ju&s;tice; for the prodigious quantity he wrote, for which he ran|&s;acked the ancients without mercy, whatever might have been his real merit had he taken time to cor|rect and poli&s;h his works, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for him to turn any thing out of hand likely to &s;ecure him a &s;olid reputation; and thus we have a li&s;t of twenty-four pieces, out of two hundred and twenty which he him&s;elf &s;ays he either wrote or was con|cerned in, little more known at this moment than by their titles.</P>
<P>HEYWOOD was certainly a good cla&s;&s;ical &s;cholar, and as an actor he was pretty celebrated. Indeed the pur&s;uing this occupation, and his being perpe|tually in company, for we are ridiculou&s;ly told that he wrote his plays upon the backs of tavern bills, mu&s;t have left him but little opportunity to complete the difficult ta&s;k of writing plays, e&s;pecially &s;uch an immen&s;e number as are attributed to him.</P>
<P>MARLOE who brought out his fir&s;t play in 1590,
<PB N="107" REF="105">
probably for the rea&s;ons before given, the very year when SHAKESPEAR al&s;o produced his fir&s;t piece, was celebrated as an actor and well e&s;teemed as a writer. HEYWOOD calls him the be&s;t of poets, not recollecting, perhaps, that SHAKESPEAR was in exi&s;tence. He de&s;ervedly, however, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con|&s;iderable reputation; and, with all the ponderous merit of JONSON's tragedy writing, I &s;hould rather think the efforts of MARLOE, either in them&s;elves or the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they have afforded to others will have a longer and a better claim to the approbation of the public than tho&s;e of the theatrical lawgiver.</P>
<P>MARLOE wrote no comedy, and his two trage|dies of <HI>Tamberlane the Great,</HI> and his <HI>Edward the Second,</HI> are all that properly came before us here. The latter, however, did not make its appearance till 1598, during which lap&s;e, as SHAKESPEAR brought out &s;even hi&s;torical plays, he clearly made it his &s;tudy to derive every po&s;&s;ible advantage from &s;o advantageous a circum&s;tance, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that <HI>Edward the Second</HI> is by no means a bad play. The &s;ubject is well cho&s;en, and the piece di&s;plays the trouble&s;ome events of that mo|narch's reign, particularly the fall of GAVESTON in very lively colours.</P>
<P>MARLOE would very probably have en&s;ured to
<PB N="108" REF="106">
him&s;elf a much greater degree of reputation had he not been led away by GEORGE PEELE and that &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> already &s;poken of, who gave into all manner of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and were little better than athei&s;ts. The weakne&s;s of MARLOE's mind made him a prey to the folly and wickedne&s;s of the&s;e abominable doctrines; and in his pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2+ letters">gate moments, he wrote &s;everal tracts, the manife&s;t drift of which was to prove our SAVIOUR an impo&s;tor, and to &s;hew that the &s;criptures were full of idle &s;tories, and that re|ligion was only policy and prie&s;t craft.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e paroxy&s;ms of folly have prevailed on certain re&s;tle&s;s individuals in all ages, and have con|&s;tlly excited &s;ome curio&s;ity from their novelty, and as con&s;tantly dwindled into ju&s;t contempt and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ation. It &s;eems to have proceeded in MAR|LOE from fits of drunken phrenzy; for, in one of the&s;e he attempted to kill a footman whom he &s;u&s;|pected of having been too kindly received by one of his dulcineas, when the man in &s;elf defence di|ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ed the direction of the weapon; which, enter|ing into MARLOES head, killed him upon the &s;pot.</P>
<P>This &s;udden death was con&s;idered as a judgment from Heaven for his impiety, and tho&s;e who had before the weakne&s;s to admire his writings, going to the oppo&s;ite extreme, now abhorred him and blamed them&s;elves for then wickedne&s;s and credulity.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="107">MARSTON, who wrote two plays during the reign of ELIZABETH, was con&s;idered as an eminent poet. His particular merit was the purity and ele|gance of his &s;tyle, in which he carefully &s;hunned all kind of ribaldry, gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and ob&s;cenity; &s;o much &s;o, &s;ays an author, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what&s;oever even in the &s;pring of his years he pre&s;ented upon the private and public theatre, in his autumn and declining age he needed not to be a&s;hamed of."</Q></P>
<P>He had, however, more merit than this which would be pretty evident, had we not the te&s;timony of his writings, from the boiling envy it excited in JONSON; who, peaceable as MARSTON was, drew on him&s;elf, by his repeatedly provoking conduct, a large &s;hare of that poet's literary ca&s;tigation. They were a long time friends, and MARSTON dedicated his play of the <HI>Malcontent</HI> to JONSON in warm and hand&s;ome terms. Envious, however, of his ri&s;ing &s;ame, as we have &s;een in the ca&s;e of CHAPMAN, and which was the ca&s;e indeed with mo&s;t of his co|temporaries, JONSON &s;oon forfeited all preten&s;ions to friend&s;hip, and violently broke through every tie of honour and gratitude; holding up the man who loaded him with carre&s;&s;es to contempt and ridicule.</P>
<P>MARSTON provoked to the utermo&s;t retorted upon JONSON; and, in his epi&s;tle prefixed to his
<PB N="110" REF="108">
tragedy of <HI>Sophoni&s;ba,</HI> mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully ridiculed the pedantic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">oppery in his works, and detected tho&s;e thefts from the ancients with which he had &s;tuffed <HI>Sejanus and Catiline.</HI> MARSTON produced eight plays, which are now, indeed, but little known, but &s;ome of them have &s;erved as the ground work for the writings of &s;ucceeding authors.</P>
<P>DECKER, another poet, for a time in friend&s;hip with JONSON, and afterwards mo&s;t &s;everely &s;a|tirized by that drawcancer in literature, produced two plays before the reign of JAMES. What was the particular cau&s;e of the quarrel cannot now be known, but it is univer&s;ally agreed that JONSON's envy and rancour, not being able to bear a rival near the throne, was its origin. We may collect a very faithful idea of it from the di&s;pute between POPE and CIBBER; which, having originated in ran|cour on the &s;ide of POPE, every &s;troke he aimed at his adver&s;ary recoiled upon him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In JONSON's <HI>Poeta&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Dunciad</HI> of that time, DECKER, under the title of CRISPINUS, is mo&s;t &s;everely handled. This literary hawk, however, &s;o very fond of annoying &s;mall birds, had better, in this in&s;tance, have &s;oared on without having at|tempted to pounce upon DECKER; for, as it hap|pens with other hawks, that the very &s;parrows, who
<PB N="111" REF="109">
are afraid of them on the ground, attack them &s;uc|ce&s;sfully in the open air; &s;o the light and agile DECKER, pegged away at the clum&s;y and unweildy JONSON, to &s;o good a purpo&s;e, that he not only made his feathers fly but he galled him all over.</P>
<P>This he effected by writing a play called the <HI>Sa|tyroma&s;tix; or the untru&s;&s;ing the humerous Poet.</HI> Here, under the name of young HORACE, he has made JONSON the hero of the piece. The public were charmed with the circum&s;tance, and the play did wonders. Nay this was the foundation of DECKER's reputation, who&s;e writings were certainly not of the fir&s;t rate kind, yet, after his pride had been rou&s;ed by the favourable turn this controver&s;y took, he made up by a&s;&s;iduity what he wanted in talents, and, having become a good judge of dra|matic effect, he enjoyed a con&s;iderable degree of reputable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Old Fortunatus,</HI> which, perhaps, originally rou&s;ed the hornet JONSON, for, extravagant as the &s;tory is the piece has great merit, and <HI>Satyroma&s;tix</HI> are all the plays of this author that come under our no|tice here. He wrote &s;ingle eight others, &s;everal in conjunction with WEBSTER, DAY, and other poets, and three or four be&s;ides are attributed to him.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="110">To MIDDLETON very little more has been at|tributed but that he wrote in conjunction at times with JONSON, FLETCHER, MASSINGER, and others; and this has been quoted as a proof that he could not be de&s;titute of merit. A better proof, however, are his own plays, &s;ome of which are now in print, and well known; among the&s;e are <HI>A Mad World my Ma&s;ters, The Mayor of Queenborough,</HI> &amp;c. and they rank his reputation about upon a par with DECKER's.</P>
<P>From the production of SHAKESPEAR's fir&s;t play to the death of queen ELIZABETH, who, it &s;hould be mentioned tran&s;lated one of the tragedies of EURIPIDES, few known authors, except tho&s;e here enumerated, wrote for the &s;tage. EEDES is &s;aid to have written &s;everal plays but we know not even their titles. We are told that he wrote them in his youth, that they were mo&s;tly tragedies, and that, becoming in maturer years, a grave divine, a pre|bendary and chaplain to the queen, he &s;tuck alto|gether to the duties of his profe&s;&s;ion, and, perhaps, upon this account he would not &s;uffer his plays to be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>YARRINGTON wrote one play, &s;o did PORTER, &s;o did BRANDON, and BERNARD tran&s;lated the co|medies
<PB N="113" REF="111">
of TERENCE. Be&s;ides the&s;e there were about thirty plays written by anonymous authors, &s;o that during a period of fourteen years more than &s;eventy plays were produced, only forty of them legitimately owned, and, out of tho&s;e forty, twenty-five were certainly from the pen of SHAKESPEAR, and four others were attributed to him.</P>
<P>It will be &s;een by this what complete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion he had of the &s;tage during the latter end of ELIZA|BETH's reign, and that in the &s;hort period of four|teen years he brought it to a degree of perfection, beyond which it has not &s;ince gone, nor can it ever go.

<HEAD>CHAP VI. PLAY HOUSES AND ACTORS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already &s;een that noblemen retained players in their &s;ervice, and that no others were regu|larly tolerated, but that even this was not &s;ufficient to re&s;train their licentiou&s;ne&s;s, and, therefore, in 1589, the year in which SHAKESPEAR is &s;aid to have pro|duced his fir&s;t play, a circum&s;tance on this very ac|count highly improbable, players were altogether &s;ilenced till further notice.</P>
<P>Whether the influence of SHAKESPEAR revoked this mandate very &s;uddenly or not, it will be diffi|cult to &s;ay. It is certain, however, that his fir&s;t play reduced the theatrical &s;tate to &s;uch order that playhou&s;es began from that moment to multiply, and we find that, during the life time of this extraordinary man, no fewer than &s;eventeen were known; among the&s;e were St. Paul's &s;inging &s;chool, the Globe on the Bank&s;ide, Southwark, the Swan, the Hope, both al&s;o in Southwark, the Fortune, between White Cro&s;s

Street and Golden Lane, the Red Bull in St. John's Street, the Cro&s;s Keys in Grace Church Street, the Tuns, the Theatre, the Curtain, the Nur&s;ery in Bar|bican, the Playhou&s;e in Blackfriars, the Playhou&s;e in Whitefriars, the Playhou&s;e in Sali&s;bury Court, the Cock Pit, and the Phoenix.</P>
<P>We have here only &s;ixteen. It is in&s;i&s;ted upon, however, that there was another, a matter, however, of no great moment, nor ought we to under&s;tand that, though all the&s;e were built during the life time of SHAKESPEAR, they were, therefore, built on his account, for the Fortune, the Theatre, and the Cur|tain, were erected between 1570 and 1580; the Fortune, according to &s;everal writers, being the fir&s;t regular Engli&s;h theatre, though it is much more pro|bable to &s;uppo&s;e it was the Theatre, from its name, which &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e that it was the only theatre.</P>
<P>The term regular theatre u&s;ed here is vague enough, for theatres could not be called regular till they had &s;cenes, an advantage none of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">a&s;ted; though there cannot be a doubt but they had at times &s;ome &s;ort of decorations, for the&s;e, even at the time of the My&s;teries, are particularly de&s;cribed to us, and as to the Ma&s;ques, which were performed at public weddings, and at court, there is no doubt

but the fir&s;t architects and painters were employed to decorate them.</P>
<P>It is, however, certain that matted walls, or ta|pe&s;try at be&s;t, were all the decorations then of the theatre, and the&s;e the audience were to fancy gar|dens, towns, palaces, or whatever el&s;e the poet might think proper; be&s;ides which the performances were by day light, another draw-back on &s;tage effect, the nece&s;&s;ary deception of which was, of cour&s;e, by this circum&s;tance materially injured.</P>
<P>But the grand di&s;advantage, which mu&s;t have been a con&s;iderable check to the genius of SHAKES|PEAR, was that women's characters were performed by men. It is evident that from this circum&s;tance he kept many of his female characters in the back ground, and even the performance of tho&s;e which, from their con&s;equence in the piece, were obliged to be prominent, mu&s;t have been nece&s;&s;arily inferior to what they would have been had they been repre|&s;ented by women.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid that this objection holds good as to other authors as well as to SHAKESPEAR, and this is true; but, when in ju&s;tice we are obliged to allow his great &s;uperiority in point of merit, it will
<PB N="117" REF="117">
operate on that very account in a much &s;tronger degree to his di&s;advantage than any other.</P>
<P>The public were certainly glad enough to take things as they found them, and the rage mu&s;t have been very high indeed at that time for dramatic en|tertainments when &s;o many theatres, &s;o ill furni&s;hed with every requi&s;ite but good plays, could find means to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>As to actors, they mu&s;t have been numerous in|deed, and, upon con&s;ideration, we cannot help credit|ing they were performers of merit; for, as they, as well as the authors, mu&s;t have found their di&s;advan|tages in rafters for ornamented ceilings, pla&s;tered walls for woods, rocks, and palaces, and &s;ometimes neither ceilings nor walls at all, for in the Inn-yards they performed in the open air; there mu&s;t certainly have been a great deal of the true Ro&s;cian &s;tuff about the Engli&s;h actors at that time, for the le&s;s they had to help them out, the more they had to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>This merit will be the more ea&s;ily allowed when we recollect that the Engli&s;h authors, like the Gre|cian, were al&s;o actors; and that SHAKESPEAR, JON|SON, MARSTON, and MARLOE, enforced the effect of their writings by per&s;onating tho&s;e characters
<PB N="118" REF="118">
they delineated. We know not their exact merits upon the &s;tage, and we have been told, by way of detraction, that SHAKESPEAR never attained a higher rank than the performance of the Gho&s;t in his own <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and this may be a very good argument with tho&s;e who e&s;timate parts by their length&punc; I have &s;een GARRICK perform the Gho&s;t in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> and I &s;hould not think it an unfair argument to &s;up|po&s;e had GARRICK's merit preponderated on the &s;ide of his writing, which po&s;terity may know, in|&s;tead of his acting which it cannot, that this very circum&s;tance would be cited to prove the Engli&s;h ROSCIUS a very mediocre actor; &s;o careful are we before we allow men too much merit.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration does not weigh a feather in the argument. I cannot &s;ay that SHAKESPEAR was a capital actor, nor can any one demon&s;trate to me that he was a bad one. His le&s;&s;on to the prayers in <HI>Hamlet</HI> &s;hews pretty clearly that he knew what acting was; and it is not very likely that be would be either &s;o ignorant or &s;o vain as uncon&s;ciou&s;ly to write in this le&s;&s;on a &s;atire again&s;t him&s;elf. At any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> it is impo&s;&s;ible but that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the writers them|&s;elves mu&s;t have added material weight to the cele|brity of their pieces; and really one cannot but be charmed, even in the acting of the pre&s;ent day, ad|mirable as it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, when one &s;ees now
<PB N="119" REF="119">
and then a gleam of &s;en&s;e labouring to make its way through a <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"congregation of vapours,"</Q> by means of which film authors are mi&s;repre&s;ented, nature tor|tured into every &s;hape but her own, and ea&s;e and &s;implicity di&s;torted into affectation and caricature.</P>
<P>It will not be ea&s;ily credited, as the&s;e authors were al&s;o actors, that the profe&s;&s;ion of a dramatic performer was not in great e&s;timation at that time; nay, it is not clear to me but that it was then in much greater repute than it is now, or ever will be again; and the rea&s;on is there was more gratitude in the treatment they received, and a higher admiration of men that the public con&s;idered in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of talents &s;uperior to their own.</P>
<P>On this account, as it has often happened in other countries, men of the fir&s;t abilities, and in the highe&s;t &s;ituations, did not di&s;dain to become actors; for no tolerated profe&s;&s;ion is di&s;gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">ful unle&s;s the mem|bers them&s;elves di&s;grace it. Tho&s;e of this de&s;crip|tion who had talents them&s;elves, readily embraced it, tho&s;e who had not readily encouraged talents in others. Sir THOMAS MORE did not di&s;dain to turn actor, &s;o little did he fear that the di&s;repute of the profe&s;&s;ion could injure the morality of the man; and TARLETON, who was really a licentious cha|racter, was, neverthele&s;s, on account of his merit
<PB N="120" REF="120">
admired, and even honoured, till his profligacy &s;hut him out of that &s;ociety exactly as it mu&s;t have done out of any other.</P>
<P>There is another rea&s;on why the actors of that time mu&s;t have been de&s;ervedly celebrated. Good write|ing requires good acting; and when have we wit|ne&s;&s;ed &s;uch good writing as that of SHAKESPEAR? In him we have come to the perfection of the art. Have we had any thing &s;ince that demands the exertion nece&s;&s;ary for the performance of RICHARD, LEAR, HAMLET, OTHELLO, MACBETH, and many other parts that the reader will point out to me? Do not nineteen out of twenty actors chu&s;e a character for their fir&s;t appearance from SHAKESPEAR? Why? Becau&s;e the merit of the author a&s;&s;i&s;ts the reputation of the actor, and thus we are obliged to go back to the matter of that time before we can &s;hew what the exertions of actors at that time required.</P>
<P>We are told by various writers, decidedly, and without re&s;erve, that acting has gradually declined from the time of SHAKESPEAR, and that the art is lo&s;t. BURBAGE, who was the original RICHARD the third, LOWIN the fir&s;t HAMLET, and HENRY the eighth, and KEMPE, who was inimitable in the Clowns, are po&s;itively &s;aid to have as much &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="121" REF="121">
HART, LACY, MOHUN, SHATTERAL, and CLUN, who &s;ucceeded, as they did BETTERTON, and that &s;et.</P>
<P>If this be true, which, however, it is extremely difficult to vouch, the merit of an actor mu&s;t have been &s;uppo&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t at that time of all the force and power nece&s;&s;ary to be a&s;&s;umed, in order to give effect to the repre&s;entation of great characters, un|a&s;&s;i&s;ted by tho&s;e decorations which now frequently attract the public without acting at all; and this admitted, it was the acting of ROSCIUS, of AESOP, of tho&s;e Mimes, of who&s;e action alone we are told &s;uch prodigious things.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the Engli&s;h &s;tage po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the be&s;t merit of the Grecian. and the be&s;t merit of the Ro|man; for it was &s;upported by actors of both &s;orts. SHAKESPEAR and the other authors gave to acting a Grecian poli&s;h, following the &s;teps of AESCHYLUS, and BURBAGE, LOWIN, and the re&s;t, made it a profe&s;&s;ion &s;ingly, and emulated the Roman per|fection of ROSCIUS and AESOP.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, as &s;o many theatres exi&s;ted at that time, the number of actors mu&s;t have been im|men&s;e; but, as a minute enquiry into this would lead
<PB N="122" REF="122">
us only into conjecture, for, though a lamentable, one it is a certain fact that po&s;terity cares but little for that merit which does not &s;ub&s;tantiate it&s;elf, I &s;hall leave this &s;ubject till it can be better elucidated by a de&s;cription of tho&s;e plays and their repre&s;entation which to an a&s;toni&s;hing number did great credit to the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t during the life of SHAKESPEAR.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. STATE OF LITERATURE AT THE DEATH OF ELIZABETH.</HEAD>
<P>As it always happens that, while improvement in any one &s;tudy is going forward, a &s;en&s;ible &s;ympathy is felt in all the collateral parts, &s;o it will be found in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance that, while SHAKESPEAR was improving the &s;tage, the relative arts were every where verging nearer to perfection.</P>
<P>Poetry, painting, and mu&s;ic, in the reign of ELIZABETH, began as if by general con&s;ent to throw off barbari&s;m; and, though their various merits manife&s;ted them&s;elves in different parts of EUROPE, the general effect was electric; and while the Mu&s;es &s;eparately cho&s;e re&s;idences, the influence of all was diffu&s;ed from people to people.</P>
<P>ITALY, however, was the IDA. There the arts which had been fo&s;tered under the au&s;pices of LEO the tenth, now began to gain decided pre-eminence.
<PB N="124" REF="124">
Painting, however, which had reached to a &s;ublime height, and mu&s;ic which had acquired poli&s;h and refinement, &s;eemed to keep their ground firmer than the &s;tand made by literature; which, after the won|derful TASSO, and the charming GUARINI, yielded to the influence of the &s;plendid talents and great genius po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by poets of other nations.</P>
<P>The Spaniards, with CERVANTES at their head, began to grow very con&s;picuous in literature. MAL|HERBE about this time taught the French how to write poetry, MAMBRUN gave their language every poli&s;h that it could require from critical and gram|matical excellence, and the&s;e poets, MALHERBE in particular, &s;tampt a regulation and a criterion which overcame all the gothic barbari&s;m into which French erudition had been plunged, and refined it into that elegance and neat point for which it has been &s;ince &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated.</P>
<P>Engli&s;h erudition, at no time calculated for that which is light and &s;uperficial, but always for that which is &s;olid and true, had imbibed nothing more of Italian flight, of French point, of Spani&s;h &s;arca&s;m than &s;erved the purpo&s;e of enforcing the nece&s;&s;ary end to which the argument in que&s;tion tended. Ima|gery it had wide and comprehen&s;ive as the imagi|nations that produced it, but the flowers were not
<PB N="125" REF="125">
born to decay, but to illu&s;trate truth and picture na|ture by the beauty of their colouring, and the &s;weet|ne&s;s of their odour.</P>
<P>Should any one doubt this, let him range with SPENCER's <HI>Fairy Queen</HI> through all the wilds of fancy, the labyrinths of allegory, and the mazes of enchantment; and, as each new &s;light of imagination &s;urprizes him into wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment, let it al&s;o convince him into virtue and truth.</P>
<P>There would be no more difficulty by a review of the <HI>Shepherd's Calender</HI> to pronounce SPENCER a &s;uperior pa&s;toral poet to GUARINI, or any other writer back to THEOCRITUS, than to prove SHAKES|PEAR &s;uperior to any other dramatic author. Pa&s;toral poetry has but one character; and, whether we re|&s;ort to VIRGIL, to MAMBRUN, his imitator, or on|ward to any or all of tho&s;e various penners of &s;elf evident truths who have written of hills and dales and fondly fancied them&s;elves poets, the objects mu&s;t be obvious, &s;imple, and natural, and tho&s;e who have been &s;o fortunate, or rather ingenious to blend intere&s;t, inculcate moral, and afford plea&s;ure, with|out in&s;ipidity, dullne&s;s, or puerility, a charge in which many eminent pa&s;toral poets are unfortunately in|volved, are certainly the be&s;t writers of this de&s;|cription, and, therefore, I &s;hall not he&s;itate to pro|nounce

The famou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> ballad of SHEN|STONE, who, if he had imitated SPENCER as clo&s;ely in every thing el&s;e as he did in the Schoolmi&s;tre&s;s, would have held a higher re|putation, has a poorer recommendation to public favour than any thing which ever obtained it, and this is &s;aying a great deal, witne&s;s the following parody <Q REND="inline">"On my banks are all furni&s;hed with bees,"</Q> which is ju&s;t as good and not a whit more ridiculous than the original:
<Q><LG>
<L>My hives are all furni&s;hed with bees,</L>
<L>Quick&s;et hedges my fences adorn,</L>
<L>My woods are all crouded with trees,</L>
<L>And my fields yellow over with corn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I &s;eldom have found any tares,</L>
<L>Of &s;uch u&s;e are my harrow and plough,</L>
<L>In my orchard grow apples and pears,</L>
<L>In my dairy there's milk from the cow.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Had the ballad, of which this is part of a parody, never been publi&s;hed, the&s;e lines might have &s;tood with nine readers out of ten for good pa&s;toral poetry, for the images are as true, as appropriate, and as intere&s;ting as in the original; but as unfortunately they con|tain only a repre&s;entation of well known objects merely noticed and not wrought upon, nobody cares a hal&s;penny for the &s;hepherd's picture&s;que retreat, and the poetry &s;inks into quaintne&s;s and puerility. If he had &s;hewn how he trafficked with his honey, and that with the money it produced he brought up a growing family, or &s;olaced an aged parent; how his fences &s;erved to de&s;cribe him a worthy mem|ber of &s;ocial life by parting off his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from tho&s;e of his neigh|bour, and, therefore, preventing depredations on either &s;ide, how his trees yielded him firing and timber for u&s;e and profit, and kindly formed a &s;hade when fatigue courted him to repo&s;e. Had he, in &s;hort, &s;hewn the comforts derived from his little harve&s;t, the fruit of his indu&s;try; the advantage of his harrow and plough, and other agricultural inventions; the cyder, the perry, the butter, the chee&s;e, and other ble&s;&s;ings &s;pringing from the produce of his orchard and his dairy. Then would the feigned character of the pea&s;ant have &s;poken the beauty of the poet, and given the &s;imple&s;t of the&s;e objects a valua|ble intere&s;t. But this is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, even with the be&s;t writers; and, for readers, it is inconceivable how the correcte&s;t under&s;tandings are too often deceived into admiration by mere &s;ound. A gentle|man of &s;trong genius, fini&s;hed education, and true poetic fancy, who has long given up writing for no other rea&s;on than becau&s;e after taking unwearied pains, he could not meet with a liberal book|&s;eller, wrote a burle&s;que pa&s;toral which is &s;tark non&s;en&s;e from be|ginning to end, and yet it has been greatly admired as excellent poetry. I have heard &s;everal per&s;ons whole under&s;tandings rank high in the opinion of the world, &s;peak in rapture of the follow|ing lines.<Q><L>But hark what odours whi&s;per in the wind?</L>

<P>HALL, who was a very accompli&s;hed poet as well as a learned and &s;en&s;ible divine, &s;erved not only the cau&s;e of the church but literature in ge|neral; for, while his writings, under the title of <HI>Meditations,</HI> improved the mind, enlarged the un|der&s;tanding, inculcated the duties of religion, and de&s;cribed the beauty of virtue, proving that mo|de&s;ty, meekne&s;s, and piety, which he practi&s;ed, his <HI>Satires,</HI> which are full of admirable point, enlivened the imagination, and expo&s;ed the deformity of vice, to the deri&s;ion and contempt in which he him&s;elf held it.</P>

<P>DANIEL, poet laureat to queen ELIZABETH, was the fir&s;t who began to give hi&s;tory a proper poli&s;h as well as a nece&s;&s;ary per&s;picuity. DANIEL had a good deal of the poet in him, and the actions of the great and good are be&s;t delivered from a poetic mind. His relations of facts are brief and pointed, and his ob&s;ervations, both political and moral, inform and entertain.</P>

a preceptor in hi&s;tory of wonderful talents and en|dowments; a man who&s;e clearne&s;s, force, and na|tural elegance, had long given lu&s;tre to erudition. This will be acknowledged what I &s;ay that I mean BUCHANAN, that mixture of SALLUST and LIVY, who united brevity and per&s;picuity with grace and politene&s;s, and whom DANIEL &s;eems to have copied on this account.</P>
<P>BUCHANAN was much honoured in other coun|tries as well as in SCOTLAND, where he was born; and even MELVIL, his cotemporary and rival, who e&s;pou&s;ed oppo&s;ite opinions, who was the firm and faithful adherent of MARY Queen of Scots, which mi&s;guided woman, had not her weakne&s;s led her to li&s;ten to the advice of le&s;s able and le&s;s honourable coun&s;ellors, might have e&s;caped all her misfortunes, was not aver&s;e to do every ju&s;tice to the fame and talents of BUCHANAN.</P>
<P>Added to all the other admirable qualities po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by BUCHANAN, he was celebrated for the charms of his conver&s;ation, in which he &s;eems to have emulated the Greeks. for his ob&s;ervations were &s;hort, nervous, and pointed; full of truth, know|ledge, and experience; and might, had they been collected, have made a complete &s;tring of apo|thegms.

His &s;implicity, however, and deference led him into an attention to others more artful than him&s;elf, who impo&s;ed upon his credulity, e&s;pecially in religious matters.</P>
<P>By this means, though his fidelity remained un|&s;haken, he relied at la&s;t in his writings too much on the opinions of others; and, the&s;e having been ad|vanced too frequently to injure his reputation, he &s;ub|&s;cribed to the diminution of his own con&s;equence, little &s;u&s;pecting he was the dupe of an impo&s;ition which he him&s;elf would have di&s;dained to practi&s;e.</P>
<P>This and his popularity, lowered him de&s;ervedly in the judgment of the learned, for he grew carele&s;s and adopted any vulgar opinion &s;o it &s;erved to pro|cure him temporary admiration. Shewing that, dif|ficult as it is to attain fame, 'tis much more difficult to pre&s;erve it. The mo&s;t unfriendly, however, of his flatterers, who poi&s;oned the chalice of prai&s;e they held up to him for his refre&s;hment, and the mo&s;t inveterate of his more hone&s;t, becau&s;e more open enemies, have never, either by refined in&s;inua|tion, or envious a&s;&s;ertion, been able to withhold from him the impartial award of po&s;terity which has confirmed him a firm philo&s;opher, an elegant hi&s;|torian, a perfect morali&s;t, and a good man.</P>

<P>At length, his philanthropic and meritorious &s;er|vices having been felt and acknowledged, and the times demanding a more active exerci&s;e of &s;uch brilliant talents, he was called again into action; when, with the benignity and forgetfulne&s;s of injury only native in a great mind, he lo&s;t his anger in his patrioti&s;m, and ru&s;hed to &s;uccour his country.

<P>Putting by phy&s;ic, rhetoric, the mathematics, and all the relative literary &s;tudies, I &s;hall fini&s;h this &s;ubject by briefly touching on poetry of which, &s;peaking generally of the &s;ubject, I know not if SPENCER was not king. At any rate he felt him|&s;elf a monarch; but being no more than poetically &s;o, and, therefore, not able literally to command any &s;ubjects, he was determined figuratively to reign over more than all the monarchs of the earth. Thus
<PB N="142" REF="144">
whole legions of fairies, goblins, and mon&s;ters ap|peared and di&s;appeared at a &s;troke of that poetic &s;cep+tre his pen. Palaces, temples, and enchanted ca&s;tles were built in the compa&s;s of a di&s;tich; and, to make the empire large enough for its inhabitants, the whole regions of fancy were cho&s;en for his &s;cenes of action. The&s;e with great felicity, he wrought to the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of purpo&s;es; and in the rewards and puni&s;hments of his different &s;ubjects, according to their virtues and vices, he has given a &s;y&s;tem of morality that will ever be an ornament to po&s;terity. This moralily is particularly advantageous by being conveyed in a &s;tile of the mo&s;t brilliant fancy and mo&s;t perfect truth.</P>
<P>His genius has been the admiration of all tho&s;e who can feel and di&s;criminate; and what defects may be found in him were attributable only to the early times he wrote in; all that barbari&s;m having not yet been cleared away in which they were found by his predece&s;&s;or CHAUCER, in who&s;e &s;teps he trod; but being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more exalted abilities, he &s;hewed the great di&s;tinction of genius by improving upon mind, rather than manner; for SPENCER manife&s;ted all the great &s;oul of CHAUCER, without deigning &s;ervilely to confine him&s;elf to the contracted and narrow limits to which that great man had &s;ub|mitted: though, perhaps, more from nece&s;&s;ity than inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="145">The fortunes of SPENCER were truly poetical; they re&s;embled an April day, and were alternately chequered by clouds and &s;un&s;hine. It is true he wore a laurel crown, but it was &s;o barren, that it did not bear, for a con&s;iderable time, a &s;ingle leaf; and when his affairs mended, it was more owing to the &s;olicitations of tho&s;e individuals to whom he he was de&s;ervedly dear, than to his own per&s;onal merit.</P>
<P>Queen ELIZABETH, who accorded him his withering laurel, at length, by many &s;olicitations, accorded him al&s;o what enabled him for a time to live comfortably. Of this, however, this king was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and died in all the grief of low fortune and di&s;appointment. He has left, however, queen who &s;o &s;weetly &s;ings his departed merits, that the mi&s;ts of prejudice being now removed, his &s;ame will live when tho&s;e who have &s;ince attempted to endanger it, by vexations cavilling, are for|gotten.</P>

The very

colours could have flatly contradicted &s;o ab&s;urd a belief; be&s;ides, as painting is the very art which can never attain complete perfection, nature being ini|mitable, it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be, that in the barbarous age in which ALEXANDER ma&s;&s;acred &s;o many peace|able &s;trangers, who&s;e territories he laid in ruins, and who&s;e comfort he de&s;troyed, to gratify a frantic and u&s;ele&s;s ambition, that painting, which is a &s;ober, &s;tu|dious art, and which can only thrive in civilized &s;oil, could have attained any perfection, in &s;pight of the &s;tory of the birds and the curtain, or the famous &s;ay|ing that there were two ALEXANDERS one invinci|ble, &s;prung from the loins of PHILIP, and the other inimitable produced from the pencil of APELLES.</P>
<P>This cannot be better confirmed than by what actually happened in ITALY; where, previous to the incur&s;ions of the barbarians, painting flouri&s;hed to, perhaps, a higher degree of reputation than

poetry. In the latter times of the republic, and under the fir&s;t emperors, ROME had con&s;iderable ma&s;ters; but, when the barbarians, with almo&s;t as much ferocity as ALEXANDER and his army, in|undated ITALY, painting, &s;o far from boa&s;ting a &s;ingle APELLES, &s;hrunk into nothing and was re|duced to its primitive elements.</P>
<P>In the age of JULIUS the &s;econd, and LEO the tenth, it began again to revive, and this revolution has given ri&s;e to the di&s;tinction of ancient and mo|dern painting; the fir&s;t comprehending the Greek and Roman painters, and the other that &s;et who formed them&s;elves into &s;chools, and from whom alone, to &s;ay the truth, we have a right to date the perfection of this art. So that the u&s;ual mode of expre&s;&s;ing our&s;elves, according to this, is a perver|&s;ion of the original meaning; for we con&s;ider the painters who began to flouri&s;h under LEO the tenth as the ancients, which is in point of fact perfectly right; for, however, the art might before have been exerci&s;ed to the admiration of tho&s;e who were not civilized enough to judge of &s;o elegant a &s;tudy, and, however, it might have branced into partial &s;treams in GREECE and ROME, there was no &s;ource, no fountain head till it collected it&s;elf in ITALY.</P>
<P>CIMABUE in the thirteenth century with infinite
<PB N="148" REF="150">
diligence collected the materials of painting, the very idea of which had then &s;hrunk into ob&s;curity; and the difficulty with which he obtained a very &s;light knowledge of what the art had been in GREECE is quite enough to &s;hew, that what we pretend to know of it at pre&s;ent is built upon a &s;hallow foundation indeed.</P>
<P>Some Florentines &s;econded the labours of CI|MABUE, and to &s;o good a purpo&s;e, that, though rude in the profe&s;&s;ion them&s;elves, they knew &s;o well the elements of it that their &s;cholars &s;oon became celebrated; the perfection of painting therefore, may be dated from the latter part of the fifteenth century, at which time ANDREA PEROCCHIO was the ma&s;ter of LEONARDA de VINCI, PIETRO PE|RUGINO of RAPHAEL URBIN, and GHIRLANDAIO of MICHAEL ANGELO.</P>
<P>Soon after this, as all the world knows, paint|ing took &s;uch &s;trides towards perfection; that, owing to the &s;chools the&s;e great men e&s;tabli&s;hed, ANGELO having &s;et up his at FLORENCE, RAPHAEL at ROME, and VINCI at MILAN, it was carried to a pitch of excellence from which connoi&s;eurs in&s;i&s;t it has ever &s;ince been on the decline.</P>

He had many tempting offers both from FRANCE and EN|GLAND to leave his native country, but could never be prevailed upon; they were, therefore, obliged to be content with his pictures, which it may be ea&s;ily conceived, as they formed RUBENS, were admirable objects of imitation for the painters of a country, in which the art was yet in its infancy as to its na|tive arti&s;ts.</P>
<P>That it was known, however, and that very uni|ver&s;ally, cannot be doubted; for we are generally given to under&s;tand that no le&s;s than fifteen thou&s;and Flemi&s;h arti&s;ts of different de&s;criptions were &s;ettled in LONDON at the death of HENRY the eighth; and as at the head of the painters we have &s;een HOL|BEIN the principal &s;upport at that time of the Flemi&s;h &s;chool, it is impo&s;&s;ible but the art of paint|ing mu&s;t have been greatly admired, and of cour&s;e imitated.</P>

<P>HAVING already taking up the &s;ubject of GUIDO ARETINE, with a view to &s;hew that his di&s;coveries were the improvement, not the invention of mu&s;ic, I &s;hall now &s;peak of that theme, on which I always dwell with &s;o much plea&s;ure, by watching its pro|gre&s;s onward from that period to the death of of ELIZABETH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are four great men of the name of ARETINE. The fir&s;t GUIDO, is this inventor of mu&s;ic as he has been called. The &s;econd, LEONARD, was celebrated for eloquence, and had the&s;e words for an epitaph.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Since the death of LEONARD hi&s;tory is in mourning, eloquence is become mute. The Greek and Latin Mu&s;es cannot forbear &s;hedding tears."</Q>
The third, FRANCIS, was a great teacher, and &s;uch an expounder of law that he was called the Prince of Subtilties. He had &s;uch a vivacity of genius that his wit be|came a proverb. The fourth, PETER, was famous for his &s;atirical writings. He was &s;o bold as to venture invectives again&s;t kings; and, it was on this account that he got the title of the Scourge of Princes. He picqued him&s;elf on his lampoons, and &s;aid that they did more good to the world than &s;ermons, and this judgment as his &s;atire kept morality in view, obtained; but it at la&s;t led him into li|centiou&s;ne&s;s which proved fatal to him; and thus his enemies gained a complete triumph over him; for, being delighted with &s;ome ob|&s;cene and immoral conver&s;ation, he was &s;eized with &s;uch a violent fit of laughter, that, overturning the chair, on which he &s;at, he fell upon his head and received &s;uch a blow that he died upon the &s;pot.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="158">I have &s;hewn already that mu&s;ic is very ancient in this country; but, that there may be no conte&s;t as to what it was any where before ARETINE, or in what manner its influence was conveyed to the heart, I &s;hall now only take it up from his time, and keep to this &s;pot, except any allu&s;ions &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to throw a light on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity introduced mu&s;ic into ENGLAND.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"In tracing the progre&s;s of choral mu&s;ic in this country,"</Q>
&s;ays BEDE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is worthy of remark that as it was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in the cathedral of CANTERAURY, when the fir&s;t of the Roman &s;ingers &s;ettled on the conver&s;ion of the Engli&s;h to chri&s;tianity, &s;o that choir for a &s;eries of years pro|duced a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men di&s;tingui&s;hed for their excellence in it. Among the&s;e, THEODORE the archbi&s;hop, and ADRIAN the abott, his friend and coadjutor, are particularly noted."</Q></P>
<P>Thus mu&s;ic gained onward to WILLIAM the Conqueror, for this original e&s;tabli&s;hment of mu&s;ic at CANTERBURY was in the eighth century. In the
<PB N="157" REF="159">
reign of that monarch lived a man named OSBERN, though BALE places him a century backwarder, to whom is attributed as much as to ARETINE, nay, this author &s;ays that ARETINE was only his fol|lower. This man was much favoured by LAN|FRANC bi&s;hop of CANTERBURY, and is &s;poken of as one profoundly &s;killed in the &s;cience of mu&s;ic. He left behind him a treati&s;e which has thrown many new lights on harmony; but it is &s;o crude, in|dige&s;ted, and ab&s;tru&s;e, that, like many other things on that &s;ubject, it were better that it had never been written.</P>
<P>There can be no doubt, however, that, except the native and wild melodies which were the cha|racteric of the national mu&s;ic here as they were every where el&s;e, that what was called mu&s;ic &s;cien|tifically was little more than the gregorian chant, &s;o often mentioned, and which certainly made up the e&s;&s;ence of the recitative of LULLY.</P>
<P>St. BERNARD, who lived in the twelfth cen|tury, has endeavoured to &s;implify this &s;pecies of mu&s;ic, and, as he calls it,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"correct the folly of tho&s;e who depart from the rules of melody."</Q>
He complains, as any man of ta&s;te would do who lives at this day, of the foppery and irregularity of teachers, who promulgate ab&s;urdity and con&s;ecrate error.
<PB N="158" REF="160">
<Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> &s;ays he,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"they &s;ay it is done by a kind of mu&s;ical licence. What &s;ort of licence is this, which, walking in the region of di&s;&s;imilitude, in|troduces confu&s;ion and uncertainty, the mother of pre&s;umption and the refuge of error? I &s;ay what is this liberty which joins oppo&s;ites and goes beyond natural land marks; and which, as it im|po&s;es an inelegance on the compo&s;ition, offers an in&s;ult to nature."</Q></P>
<P>This man who knew and felt that nothing &s;e|conds devotion like mu&s;ic, did not wi&s;h that the prie&s;ts &s;hould introduce &s;chi&s;ms for the ears any more than for mind. Indeed his labours were in|defatigable to root out impo&s;ition in both; neither, however, &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h, though in both he wrought &s;ome reform, but impo&s;ition is the e&s;&s;ence of profe&s;&s;ors of &s;ciences as well as of religion; and while by deception money may be got little con|&s;cience will be made of pa&s;&s;ing off fallacy for truth, and art for nature.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ic was in the thirteenth century &s;o favourite a topic that it employed the pens of many eminent authors. WALTER MONK, of EVESHAM, a man as well of lively wit as of &s;incere devotion, for the&s;e qualities are certainly not incompatible, wrote a &s;en|&s;ible work which he called <HI>Of the Speculation of</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="161">
<HI>Mu&s;ic.</HI> The celebrated ROGER BACON, who was complimented on account of his extaaordinary ta|lents with the title of Magician, under a general be|lief that his tran&s;cendant abilities mu&s;t have been &s;upernatural, and who&s;e brazen head has &s;o often infu&s;ed terror into the minds of the ignorant, that he might leave no &s;cience untreated, wrote a work which he called <HI>De Valore Mu&s;ices.</HI></P>
<P>SIMON TAILLER, a dominican, and a Scotch|man, JOHANNES PEDIASIMUS, and &s;everal others, were al&s;o at this period mu&s;ical writers; but it would be trivial to notice more than that it was a part of the clerical duty to know the principles of harmony, and this clearly proves in what manner the Clerks who exhibited at Clerkenwell came to be qualified to repre&s;ent the My&s;teries, which con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;inging as well as dialogue.</P>
<P>But this is not all. Mu&s;ic was not only known to the laity, but taught them by the churchmen, who very &s;en&s;ibly and properly &s;oftened the more ri|gorous duties of religious wor&s;hip by permitting in|nocent relaxations of this kind, e&s;pecially among the youthful part of both &s;exes, who very naturally and laudably indulged in that vivacity which &s;oftened their labour and taught them to know content.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="162">Thus &s;uch &s;ongs and ballads as &s;uited their &s;itua|tions and talents, in ENGLAND as in every other country, became the delight and the &s;olace of the wretched, the luxury of the indolent, and the re|laxation of the thrifty; all which, were proof ne|ce&s;&s;ary, might be traced back to very remote times but we have no time nor occa&s;ion for the &s;earch.</P>
<P>To &s;hew, however, that nothing could be more common and familiar than mu&s;ic, it made up the delight of the people in the fourteenth century. The carpenter's wife in CHAUCER's <HI>Miller's Tale</HI> is courted to the mu&s;ic of the &s;autrie, by her lover NI|CHOLAS the &s;cholar of OXFORD. Her other lover, ABSOLON the pari&s;h clerk, &s;ings to his geterne, and his ribible. All this has been remarked by an in|genious author who &s;ays
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if &s;o many arts were ne|ce&s;&s;ary to win the heart of a carpenter's wife, what mu&s;ical accompli&s;hments mu&s;t be requi&s;ite to gain the affections of females in higher life."</Q></P>
<P>CAMDEN &s;peaks of the mu&s;ic of the&s;e times, and notices that the poetry, which was evidently comic, and which he calls <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"bobbing rhimes,"</Q> though they were levelled at the vices of the clergy, were written by clergymen. He tells us of WAL|TER de MASSES, and &s;ays that, though in the reign
<PB N="161" REF="163">
of HENRY the &s;econd, he filled all ENGLAND with his meriments, he was archdeacon of OXFORD; &s;o that poets of all de&s;criptions very &s;en&s;ibly contri|buted to the public amu&s;ement by courting the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance their writings could profit by.</P>
<P>In the fifteenth century the&s;e ditties were multi|plied into a prodigious number; CHAUCER's bal|lads, of which he compo&s;ed many, were in great vogue, as were al&s;o tho&s;e of LYDGATE, and other writers. JOHN SHIRLEY, in the year 1440, made a large collection of the&s;e which were publi&s;hed under the title of

<P>It is imagined that the tunes of the&s;e &s;ongs are all lo&s;t, but I cannot be induced to believe it, and I &s;hould not wonder on the contrary, if many of them were familiar to us at this moment.

Italian &s;chool, in its highe&s;t pro&s;perity, never pro|duced any thing, either for melody or harmony, more beautiful.</P>
<P>The earlie&s;t authority it is acknowledged that we have of a po&s;itive tune, and the name of its compo&s;er, is to a &s;ong of CHAUCER beginning,

It was compo&s;ed by CORNYSH in the reign of HENRY the eighth, but this weighs nothing with me. When I con&s;ider that one of the &s;weete&s;t combinations of melody and harmony that ever adorned the &s;weete&s;t of all &s;tudies was com|po&s;ed as nearly as po&s;&s;ible to that very time, I cannot be awake and believe that mu&s;ic, even in that reign, was not in the highe&s;t perfection, or at lea&s;t that there were not compo&s;ers that uncon&s;ciou&s;ly excelled the productions of ITALY; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to deny that it is a higher compliment to the reputation of a compo&s;er to be known by
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"How merrily we live,"</Q>
the glee that I allude to, than by the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e church compo&s;ition that ever was com|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is not therefore, certain, becau&s;e we know of no tunes written down and handed forward that we are not in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them. There cannot be a doubt but nur&s;es and other common people have learned them of one another from time immemorial;
<PB N="163" REF="165">
and, by the &s;ame token, when the beautiful melodies which are now our favourites, &s;hall be &s;ung familiarily and with plea&s;ure two hundred years hence by all tho&s;e who have hearts and ears, it will be little conjectured that they owe the de|light they receive to PURCELL, ARNE, and BOYCE.</P>
<P>According to this, I don't care for what is trea|&s;ured up, I care for what is univer&s;ally known; and my rea&s;on particularly is, that what is trea&s;ured up is &s;cientific, and what is univer&s;ally known is na|tural, one is ingenuity, and the other genius, one art, and the other nature; and thus, upon the &s;ame principle that oral tradition has done much more for hi&s;tory than record, &s;o memory mu&s;t infallibly have done more for mu&s;ic than notation, and if I am a&s;ked, having no chronicled proof of this a&s;&s;er|tion, how I can maintain it, I &s;hall an&s;wer that the fact is as unerring as any orher fixed criterion in na|ture; and that, though I did not &s;ee the &s;un &s;hine two hundred years ago, I can with &s;afety in&s;i&s;t that his beams were as radiant, and his career as glorious as at this moment.</P>

<P>It has been well noticed, by an ingenious and elegant writer, that nothing has given &s;o complete an in&s;ight into the character of mu&s;ic, at this remote period, as the writings of BOCCACE and CHAUCER. <HI>The Ten Tales</HI> of BOCCACE contained in his <HI>De|cameron,</HI> are not only entirely dramatic, but of that particular &s;pecies that might be immediately formed into operas; &s;o are the <HI>Canterbury Tales</HI> of CHAU|CER. The materials are perfectly adapted for mu&s;ic; and, to &s;hew how nearly poetry and mu&s;ic are allied, and in their nature bear the &s;ame locality, the &s;ub|jects BOCCACE has cho&s;en are elegant and refined, &s;uch would be&s;t &s;uit Italian mu&s;ic, at that time re|gular and &s;cientific, and tho&s;e of CHAUCER com|mon and natural, &s;uch as &s;uited the plain &s;implicity of Engli&s;h mu&s;ic, in which la&s;t character, by the bye, is &s;ometimes contained a &s;ublimity beyond &s;cience.</P>
<P>After a plague at FLORENCE, BOCCACE makes &s;even ladies, of noble birth and honourable princi|ples, propo&s;e to retire to a di&s;tance for fear of in|fection,
<PB N="165" REF="169">
and to deplore the misfortunes of the times; but, le&s;t they &s;hould too rigidly indulge their me|lancholy they determine to invite three gentlemen, al&s;o of birth and honour, to accomprny them. The &s;cheme is put into execution; their little retreat be|comes a perfect paradi&s;e; and, among other things, to beguile the time, they each relate a &s;tory.</P>
<P>But this is not all, we are told that this company &s;ung, danced, and played upon various in&s;truments; and we are given to under&s;tand that they introduced the &s;tory of <HI>Palamon and Arcite,</HI> which we may re|member &s;o delighted queen ELIZARETH, and other novels, and that they even called in their &s;ervants to per&s;onate the clowns and under parts, who ac|companied them&s;elves with the bagpipe, while others played the lute and the viol; hence we have clearly the origin of the Italian opera.</P>
<P>CHAUCER, who went for &s;implicity as BOCCACE did for elegance, cho&s;e a more common and more homely vehicle. He &s;uppo&s;es twenty-nine per&s;ons of both &s;exes, of as different employments and cha|racters as the mo&s;t fertile imagination could &s;ug|ge&s;t, together with him&s;elf, making in all thirty, who &s;et out from the Tabarde Inn in the Borough<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This inn was formerly the lodging of the abbot of HYDE near WINCHESTER, the &s;ign was a Tarbarde, a word &s;ignifying a &s;hort jacket, or &s;leevele&s;s coat, whole before, open on both &s;ides, with a &s;quare collar and hanging &s;leeves. STOW tells us that from the wearing of this garment &s;ome of tho&s;e on the foundation at Queen's College are called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1+ letters">aberdarii.

The ho&s;t of this inn at the time of CHAUCER was named BAILLIE. His character is admirably drawn, and the humour of it greatly heightened by his having a termagant for his wife. DRYDEN de|lights in this idea, and &s;ays that from the truth and variety thrown into the different de&s;criptions of CHAUCER's characters,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"he was enabled to form an idea of the humours, the features, nay the very dre&s;s of the pilgrims as di&s;tinctly as if he had &s;upped with them at the Tabarde at Southwark."</Q></NOTE>,

<P>Each of the&s;e characters is to tell two tales in the way to CANTERBURY, and two on their return.

Perhaps COWLEY would have liked him if he had introduced a few more expletives. The author, who&s;e work has put me in mind of this remark of DRYDEN, &s;peaks of another circum&s;tance equally as extraordinary, which is, that HANDEL make no &s;cruple of declaring him&s;elf in&s;en&s;ible as to the mu&s;ic of PURCELL.

<P>On this account tho&s;e compo&s;itions, for which Engli&s;h compo&s;ers have been &s;o celebrated, and particularly their madrigals, were not made known till early in the &s;ixteenth century; that is to &s;ay, in &s;uch a form as to be tran&s;mitted on to us, for that they were common and in high e&s;timation is in|dubitable, but being written in odd parts, without bars, and with ligatures, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to fix on them &s;o preci&s;e a character as to form any judg|ment of the melodies or the relation the parts have to each other.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, though we mu&s;t implicitly give credit to that genius and that knowledge which were as completely known in that early period in ENGLAND as every where el&s;e, yet no certainty as to their particular operation can attach to our a&s;|&s;ertions till HENRY the eighth; who, by de&s;troying the convents and with them the books and manu|&s;cripts found there, obliged mu&s;ic to &s;hift for it&s;elf; which, being a child of nature, acquired &s;trength and beauty from that emancipation.</P>
<P>We &s;hall be led, however, by this means to &s;ome
<PB N="171" REF="177">
certainty as to compo&s;ers in the fifteenth century; for not only the madrigals that were invented after the new notation were at that time printed, but many of the old ones were made to a&s;&s;ume this more per|fect form, and, therefore, are pre&s;erved even to this day. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Sumer is Icumen,</HI></Q> a celebrated madrigal for &s;ix voices, the manu&s;cript of which is now in the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, was compo&s;ed about 1460. SKEL|TON, in the reign of HENRY the &s;eventh, wrote &s;ongs, which were compo&s;ed in parts by CORNISH, and many others might be mentioned.</P>
<P>FRANCHINUS, who wrote a work which was printed at MILAN, gives &s;ome of the fir&s;t examples for the improvement of mu&s;ical notation, but the&s;e characters were cut out in blocks; the Germans, however, improved upon this practi&s;e, and that art &s;eems to have arrived to &s;omething like perfection about the year 1500, &s;o that this improvement &s;eemed ready for the u&s;e it was put to afterwards in ENGLAND; but it came to no perfection till about 1560, when a very indu&s;trious man, of the name of JOHN DAY, publi&s;hed the Church Service in four and three parts. His labours were a good deal ac|celerated by STERHOLD and HOPKINS; who, in addition to the novelty of introducing their New Ver&s;ion of the P&s;alms, brought forth the Cantiones of TALLIS and BIRD, two names of &s;ufficient con|&s;equence

to &s;hew the reputation of mu&s;ic at that time, their Anthems at this moment being held very highly in e&s;teem, as to their ingenuity, ad|mitted among the common cathedral &s;tock, and as well known as the works of any other church compo&s;ers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hi&s;tory of P&s;almody at that time &s;ets us perfectly clear as to the nature of the melodies then known and admired in ENGLAND. The P&s;alm tunes, or at lea&s;t many of them, came from the Ger|mans; and when STERNHOLD and HOPKINS publi&s;hed their Ver|&s;ion, with the tunes &s;et forth in types, they from them and from the Engli&s;h compo&s;ers got together a great number of tho&s;e tunes. The&s;e, up to this moment, fix the criterion of that melody which is the mo&s;t &s;imple, the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive, and the mo&s;t &s;ublime, be|cau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts of a few notes, and nothing can be advanced to in|validate the antiquity of tho&s;e tunes, becau&s;e, the be&s;t in the col|lection, the hundredth P&s;alm, was compo&s;ed by MARTIN LU|THER, and is literally a melody derived from in&s;piration, and clogged with no extraneous harmony, but merely a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch modulation as the melody it&s;elf dictated. So that, as far as it goes, we &s;ee the utmo&s;t of mu&s;ical perfection in LUTHER; for I'll venture to &s;ay, that we might name fifty mu&s;icians, and &s;ome that we have heard prai&s;ed too, who&s;e works altogether, in point of intrin&s;ic merit, are not equal in value to the hundredth P&s;alm. LUTHER died in 1546.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This DAY mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly and laudably, to|gether with another printer of the name of VAU|TROLLIER, brought to public view whatever could be found of value, and, therefore, I &s;hould not wonder, though the fact cannot be a&s;certained, that many of the madrigals, a&s;cribed to the com|po&s;ers
<PB N="173" REF="179">
of that time, are in fact of a much earlier date.</P>
<P>DAY and VAUTROLLIER were &s;ucceeded by THOMAS ESTE; who, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other, changed his name to SNODHAM. BIRD and MOR|LEY were afterwards granted a patent as &s;ole and exclu&s;ive printers of mu&s;ic. This patent was a&s;|&s;igned to others; but printed mu&s;ic came to no per|fection, except merely as to the form of the notes, till it was &s;tampt and engraved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The art of printing mu&s;ic with metal types obtained in ITALY about 1516, and was carried to &s;ome perfection by OTIAVIO de PE|TRICCI; and, in France, it was improved by PIERRE BALLARD. The Germans, however, were, no doubt, the inventors of types, although mu&s;ic had been long printed in ITALY with blocks, which, after all, gives the true&s;t idea of mu&s;ic as it is now printed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Gathering a&s;&s;i&s;tance from printing, writers on mu&s;ic were now better enabled to exemplify their arguments, and in con&s;equence we became more familiar with them and their works. Mu&s;icians took their degrees at the univer&s;ities, and their merit was known, and decided. German and Italian pro|ductions &s;pread over EUROPE, and it became then a po&s;itive and fixed point, as it has ever &s;ince re|mained, that ITALY was the &s;chool for vocal mu&s;ic, and Germany the &s;chool for in&s;trumental mu&s;ic.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="180">ENGLAND, in addition to its own native melodies; which, like the minds of its inhabitants, facinate by their open and unaffected manner of appealing to the heart, adopted whatever might &s;erve to a&s;&s;i&s;t mu&s;ic from foreign aid; and it has ever been a rule with all real mu&s;ical judges, that the vocal mu&s;ic of this country has received advantage from the Italian &s;chool, and the in&s;trumental from the German, and that whenever the contrary has been attempted, which has happened but too often, to the creation of &s;chi&s;ms and controver&s;ies out of number, ta&s;te has been vi|tiated, and nature and the heart have been &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of affectation and caprice.</P>
<P>The works of ARON, RAMIS, AGRICOLA, and other German writers, have dived into all the perplexity of harmony. AGRICOLA, in particular, &s;o lo&s;t him&s;elf in his own labyrinth, that, in the re|publication of his famous work, called <HI>Mu&s;ica In|&s;trumentales,</HI> he confe&s;&s;es to a friend that the fir&s;t edition was &s;o difficult to be under&s;tood, that few could read it to any advantage, and yet this author is &s;aid to have written for young beginners. He would not, however, have apologized to his friend if he had lived in the&s;e times; for the practice &s;till prevails, and young beginners are &s;et down to &s;tudy what nobody can under&s;tand without any apo|logy
<PB N="175" REF="181">
at all; but the be&s;t part of the &s;tory is that this ab&s;tru&s;e treati&s;e, publi&s;hed for the u&s;e of young be|ginners, which the author confe&s;&s;es that few could under&s;tand, is written in ver&s;e. It is a pity, while he was about it, but he had &s;et it to mu&s;ic, and &s;o joined impo&s;&s;ible precept with impracticable example.</P>
<P>The Italians, who were celebrated in the &s;ix|teenth century, have left behind them &s;everal works of con&s;iderable reputation. ZARLINO, PALES|TRINA, MARENZIO, NANINO, and ANERIO are among this number; and, to &s;hew that the fa&s;cinating power of mu&s;ic can level all di&s;tinctions, the Prince DI VENOSA was mu&s;ical rival and compe|titor to SETHUS CALVISIUS, the &s;on of a pea&s;ant. SALINAS and MORALES, though both Spaniards, as they knew nothing but what they imbibed from the Italian &s;chool, ought, properly &s;peaking, to be cla&s;&s;ed with the Italian writers.</P>
<P>ZARLINO, who was born in 1540, was intended by his parents for &s;ome learned profe&s;&s;ion, and by nature for any &s;tudy of which the human mind is capable; but mu&s;ic bounded his ambition. He was mae&s;tro di capella of St. MARK's Church, and com|po&s;ed &s;everal celebrated things, and in particular the rejoicings at VENICE upon the defeat of the Turks at LEPANTO.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="182">By having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much good &s;en&s;e and trea&s;ured up a fund of general knowledge, ZAR|LINO feit him&s;elf more competent to &s;peak on the &s;ubject of mu&s;ic than any writer of his time, and this is clearly proved by what he has given to the world, for he has entered into no pityful contro|ver&s;ies but gone at large into his theme. He at once traces mu&s;ic back to the Greeks, and from the Greeks to nature its original parent; and thus, while he &s;hews as much competency to argue as BOETIUS, and all the other Latin and Italian writers, he adds arguments of his own to &s;hew that the dig|nity of mu&s;ic is derived from its &s;implicity.</P>
<P>GALILEI the pupil &s;o ZARLINO, &s;et him&s;elf up again&s;t his ma&s;ter, calling him the corrupter of mu&s;ic, and ZARLINO an&s;wered GALILEI in a &s;train of cool irony, in which he calls him his loving di&s;ciple. The que&s;tion in di&s;pute was concerning the divi&s;ion of tones, which it would be both improper and un|nece&s;&s;ary to explain here. The e&s;&s;ence of the ar|gument was that ZARLINO was an advocate for nature and his pupil for art and it is remarkable that the partizans on each &s;ide have &s;ettled the que&s;tion in favour of mu&s;ic and ZARLINO, one by the &s;trength and the other by the weakne&s;s of their ar|guments, the fir&s;t of which has obtained to this day, and the latter long &s;unk into oblivion.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="183">SALINAS, who&s;e &s;oul was mu&s;ic, wrote very warmly on his favourite theme. The misfortune is that mu&s;ic is &s;o exten&s;ive an expre&s;&s;ion that you may apply it to any thing; and thus, by &s;tretching the qualities it really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, its admirers, out of zeal, attempt to fit them to what they cannot embrace; thus, at length, they quit mu&s;ic for proportion, and at la&s;t, proportion for calculation, &s;o that &s;ound, with|out which there cannot be mu&s;ic, is put out of the que&s;tion, and the argument becomes a mere wrangle upon paper.</P>
<P>SALINAS was blind, and he gives this as the rea&s;on for devoting him&s;elf to mu&s;ic. His own words are,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"From my very infancy I devoted my&s;elf to to the &s;tudy of mu&s;ic; for, as I had &s;ucked in blindne&s;s from the infected milk of my nur&s;e, and there remaining not the lea&s;t hope that I &s;hould ever recover my &s;ight, my parents could think of no employment &s;o proper for me as that which was now &s;uitable to my &s;ituation, as the learning nece&s;&s;ary for it might be acquired by the &s;en&s;e of hearing, that other be&s;t &s;ervant of a &s;oul endued with rea&s;on."</Q></P>
<P>PALESTRINA took a likely career to become a good mu&s;ician, not for &s;cholars, but for the world;
<PB N="178" REF="184">
for he &s;tudied under a &s;inger in the pontifical chapel, who e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;chool for vocal mu&s;ic, and thus having originally imbibed melody, he made it the ground work of all his &s;tudies.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This great genius,"</Q> &s;ays an Italian author,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"guided by a peculiar faculty, the gift of GOD, adopted a &s;tyle of harmony &s;o elegant, &s;o noble, &s;o learned, &s;o ea&s;y, and &s;o plea&s;ing, both to the connoi&s;eur and the ignorant, that in a ma&s;s, com|compo&s;ed on purpo&s;e, &s;ung before Pope MAR|CELLUS CERVINUS, and the &s;acred college of cardinals, he made that pontiff alter the intention he had of enforcing the bull of JOHN the twenty-&s;econd, which aboli&s;hed entirely church mu&s;ic, under the penalty of excommunication. This ingenious man, by his a&s;toni&s;hing &s;kill, and the di|vine melody of that ma&s;s, was appointed by PAUL the fourth, perpetual compo&s;er and director in the pontifical chapel; a dignity which has been vacant ever &s;ince his death. This ma&s;s was now and ever will be performed as long as there is a world in the &s;acred temples at ROME, and at all other places where they have been &s;o fortu|nate as to procure the compo&s;itions of &s;uch a wonderful genius, who&s;e works breathe divine harmony, and enable us to &s;ing in a &s;tyle &s;o truly &s;ublime the prai&s;es of our maker."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="185">PALESTRINA no doubt carried into better ef|fect the idea of ZARLINO, taking &s;implicity and nature for his guide; and I think there can be but little doubt that from this period the Italian and German &s;chools adopted the &s;tudies which have &s;ince &s;eparately di&s;tingui&s;hed them, PALESTRINA having in his works cured the Italians of ob&s;tru&s;ene&s;s by expo&s;ing the corrupt errors of the Germans, who having little genius &s;ub&s;tituted art for nature, and they, con&s;cious of their inability, having quietly ac|quie&s;ced in the deci&s;ion, and contented them&s;elves with phlegmatic harmonies, &s;quared and calculated, dive&s;ted of melody, and, therefore, like a body without a &s;oul, while rich melody and the &s;imple and dignified harmony that naturally belongs to it marked the productions of the Italians.</P>
<P>NANINO, was a fellow &s;tudent of PALESTRI|NA. They between them e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;chool for the &s;tudy of mu&s;ic, which was frequented by many eminent profe&s;&s;ors, and particularly by a younger brother of NANINO, who di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf as a wonderful genius, NANINO, the elder, publi&s;hed &s;ome very fine madrigals.</P>
<P>ANERIO, a di&s;ciple of NANINO, was the imme|diate &s;ucce&s;&s;or of PALESTRINA as compo&s;er to the pontifical chapel, the office of director having died
<PB N="180" REF="186">
with its exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. His profe&s;&s;ional cha|racter &s;tood very high, and he as well as VELETTRI, PONTIO, VECCHI, and others, produced many mu|&s;ical compo&s;itions of great celebrity.</P>
<P>But of all the Italian compo&s;ers in the &s;ixteenth century, MARENZIO is mo&s;t generally known to us, many of who&s;e madrigals were adapted to Engli&s;h words, and publi&s;hed by THOMAS WATSON in 1589, in a work called <HI>Mu&s;ica Tran&s;alpina</HI>; among the&s;e are <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Farewell cruel and unkind,"</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What doth my pretty darling,"</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sweet &s;inging AMA|RYLLIS,"</Q>
and <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I mu&s;t depart all haple&s;s."</Q> With MARENZIO I &s;hall fini&s;h this &s;ummary account of the Italian and German &s;chools, although there are are more than ninety other names behind of much celebrity.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that except ITALY, GERMANY, FLANDERS, and ENGLAND, mu&s;ic had made no con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the &s;ixteenth century. SPAIN had produced only MORALES and SALINAS, and the&s;e were fairly of the Italian &s;chool, and in FRANCE we hear of De PREZ, MOUTON, CRE|QUILLON, and CLAUDE, but nothing is known of them worthy of being recorded.</P>
<P>In ENGLAND, TYE, BIRD, BULL, and DOW|LAND,
<PB N="181" REF="187">
were long in &s;uch high e&s;timation that it has been contended they were equal to the be&s;t mu&s;i|cians of any country. MARBECK, however, was the earlie&s;t of the Engli&s;h compo&s;ers of any con&s;i|derable eminence; who, after having narrowly e&s;|caped the &s;take for here&s;y, or according to FOX, after having actually &s;uffered, he became inde&s;ati|gable to reform mu&s;ic with religion. Indeed the cathedral mu&s;ical &s;ervice of the Church of England was originally framed by MARBECK, and the notes of the preces, &s;uffrages, and re&s;pon&s;es, as they are at this day, were of his compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>TYE was brought up in the Chapel Royal, and mu&s;ical preceptor to the children of HENRY the eighth. He was a man of learning; and, after taking the degree of Doctor in Mu&s;ic at CAM|BRIDGE, was incorporated a member of the Uni|ver&s;ity of OXFORD. He was afterwards organi&s;t to the Chapel Royal of ELIZABETH, and was the fir&s;t who compo&s;ed anthems.</P>
<P>This was occa&s;ioned by a kind of accident. He &s;et the Acts of the Apo&s;tles to mu&s;ic; but, the &s;ub|ject being principally narrative and relation, it clearly had nothing to do with mu&s;ic, and, therefore, did not &s;ucceed. Correcting his error, he then turned his thoughts to &s;uch words in &s;cripture as
<PB N="182" REF="188">
might an&s;wer his purpo&s;e; and, recollecting that the P&s;alms of DAVID are full of that thank&s;giving, and that ebullition of the heart which mu&s;ic is &s;o parti|cularly calculated to expre&s;s, he made &s;ome e&s;&s;ays in this way, which were not only received with great encomiums by their hearers, but they have &s;erved ever &s;ince as a model for the imitation of compo&s;ers in that &s;tyle.</P>
<P>WOOD, &s;peaking of TYE, &s;ays his mu&s;ic was an|tiquated and of very little value; but BOYCE, with the true liberality of a real genius, refutes this calumny in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible way by publi&s;hing one of his anthems, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I will exalt thee,"</Q> which for melody, harmony, expre&s;&s;ion, contrivance, and general effect, is a perfect model of church compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>TALLIS followed TYE. He compo&s;ed wholly for the church; indeed he has been called the fa|ther of the cathedral &s;tyle, and con&s;idered by &s;ome as a better compo&s;er than PALESTRINA; who, as we have &s;een, was his cotemporary. This, however, mu&s;t not be allowed. No man could be more original than TALLIS, as we are told; but this is not the proper expre&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s originality may be defined an improvement on the labours of others, for TALLIS built his mu&s;ic upon the foundation of
<PB N="183" REF="189">
the old Engli&s;h cathedral compo&s;ers, and the Ger|mans, all of whom he excelled; but this cannot be con&s;idered as that &s;ort of originality which PALES|TRINA's biographer properly calls the gift of GOD; and thus it is that while TALLIS was lo&s;t in the an|cient modes, de&s;ignated by EUCLID and PTOLEMY, which are now exploded, PALESTRINA was in&s;pired with the melody of nature which will la&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>BIRD, in the earlier part of his life wholly com|po&s;ed church mu&s;ic; but, when madrigals became to be &s;o greatly in vogue that no per&s;on was e&s;teemed fa&s;hionable who could not take a part in them at &s;ight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MORLEY in his introduction makes a &s;cholar give this rea&s;on for learning mu&s;ic, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Being at a banquet,"</Q> &s;ays he,

<P><PB N="184" REF="190">Be&s;ides madrigals and merry &s;onnets, BIRD &s;eems to have been the fir&s;t who compo&s;ed le&s;&s;ons for the virginals, which con&s;i&s;ted of nothing more than variations on well known country dances; &s;o that the modern practice of compo&s;ers who adopt the melodies of others becau&s;e they have no invention them&s;elves, have done nothing new in palming this &s;econd hand ware upon their &s;cholars.</P>
<P>It was meritorious enough, however, in BIRD, for his bu&s;ine&s;s at that early time was to bring &s;imple melodies into fa&s;hion, and thus we &s;ee ladies of quality patronizing familiar mu&s;ic, till by and by it grew &s;o &s;implified that many of tho&s;e beautiful airs which we now admire in the <HI>Beggars Opera,</HI> fixed the criterion of the Engli&s;h ta&s;te.</P>
<P>In a collection of the&s;e le&s;&s;ons, which were de|dicated to lady NEVILLE, and compo&s;ed for her u&s;e, and which we are told, though produced at that early period, are very difficult to execute, he has rung the changes on <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"St. Leger,"</Q> or as it is com|monly called, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sellenger's Round,"</Q>

<PB N="185" REF="191">
BIRD mu&s;t have done a great deal towards poli&s;hing the general ta&s;te for mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>After all, however, church mu&s;ic and works of the learned ca&s;t were principally the favourite &s;tudy of BIRD; though, except in a few in&s;tances, po&s;terity will have more obligations to him for his lighter compo&s;itions, notwith&s;tanding many learned opinions to the contrary. His &s;ervice which, with a diligence honourable to him&s;elf and his profe&s;&s;ion, was pre|&s;erved by BOYCE, and &s;ome other compo&s;itions are greatly creditable to this compo&s;er.</P>
<P>But the production that has e&s;tabli&s;hed the re|putation of BIRD, I hope, upon a right foundation, is the famous Canon, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Non nobis Domine."</Q> The Italians po&s;itively &s;ay that it is the compo&s;ition of PALESTRINA; it is allowed on all hands that it has been long depo&s;ited in the Vatican Library, and tho&s;e who argue on this &s;ide of the que&s;tion main|tain their po&s;ition by &s;aying that the &s;ubject was wrought into a concerto and publi&s;hed at AMSTER|DAM by CARLO RICCIOTTI, with a note mention|ing that the fugue is taken from a Canon of PALES|TRINA. Now, unfortunately, this concerto is extant and the fugue is worked from Non nobis Domine; and, if the general ideas of an ingenious man may
<PB N="186" REF="192">
be adduced as evidence in his favour, the compo|&s;ition of PALESTRINA beginning
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Sicut cervus de&s;iderat,"</Q>
and the canon in que&s;tion &s;eem to have emanated from the &s;ame mind.</P>
<P>On the &s;ide of BIRD it is argued that HILTON has po&s;itively publi&s;hed this canon as his, and Dr. PEPUSCH, who&s;e re&s;earches certainly were very di|ligent and u&s;eful, has a&s;cribed it to him in a very unqualified manner, and be&s;ides this, collateral proof has been brought that it was the natural bent of BIRD's di&s;po&s;ition, and that, though he did now and then make variations upon country dances to oblige lady NEVILLE, church mu&s;ic and compo&s;itions of the more &s;erious kind were his be&s;t delight, and what he was mo&s;t qualified for. They are, how|ever, obliged to allow that it was never publi&s;hed in any of his works; which, as it is &s;o admirable a compo&s;ition is not only unfortunate but rather ex|traordinary, and thus it remains a moot point whe|ther BIRD or PALESTRINA was the compo&s;er of Non nobis Domine.</P>
<P>I &s;hall next mention FERABOSCO; who, though of Italian parents, was born in ENGLAND. MOR|LEY &s;peaks very highly of his merit and &s;ays that he and BIRD had many friendly trials of &s;kill in mu&s;ic. In two in&s;tances FERABOSCO bore away the palm,

one of the&s;e begins with the words,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The nightin|gale &s;o plea&s;ant and &s;o gay,"</Q>
and the other,

<P>Indeed Engli&s;h mu&s;ic has many obligations to this man, his &s;on, and another of his family. Many of our be&s;t melodies which PEPUSH &s;o judiciou&s;ly &s;elected for the Beggars Opera are &s;uppo&s;ed to have ari&s;en from that &s;ource, and tho&s;e in the minuet &s;tyle in particular have &s;o &s;imple and pure an ele|gance, that as long as there is a world, as PALES|TRINA's panegyri&s;t &s;ays, that world will be delighted with them.</P>
<P>BLITHEMAN, whom STOW in his &s;urvey not only has thought it worth his while to mention by name, but of whom he has printed the epitaph at length, was al&s;o celebrated at this time, but more as a teacher than a compo&s;er. The white&s;t feather, however, in his wing was his being preceptor to Dr. BULL, who&s;e chri&s;tian name, by the bye, was JOHN, He was a celebrated mu&s;ician admitted fir&s;t as Bachelor of Mu&s;ic at OXFORD, afterwards as Doc|tor at CAMBRIDGE, and, at length, appointed or|gani&s;t of the Queen's Chapel.</P>
<P>BULL was the fir&s;t Gre&s;ham profe&s;&s;or of mu&s;ic; being, however, as his chri&s;tian name be&s;peaks him
<PB N="188" REF="194">
a plain Engli&s;hman, he was unable to read his lec|tures in Latin. The queen, therefore, gave him an e&s;pecial permi&s;&s;ion to deliver them in Engli&s;h, for which &s;he has been ridiculed under an ab&s;urd idea that if he did not know Latin he could not know mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>JOHN, &s;till like a true Engli&s;hman, travelled for improvement; and, having heard of a famous mu|&s;ician at St. OMER's, he placed him&s;elf under him as a novice, but he &s;oon found, as is generally the truth in &s;uch ca&s;es, that he knew more than his ma&s;ter. Among other proofs of this, the mu&s;ician &s;hewed him a &s;ong that he had compo&s;ed in forty parts, telling him at the &s;ame time that he would defy all the world to produce any per&s;on capable of adding another part to his compo&s;ition. BULL de|&s;ired to be left alone and to be indulged for a &s;hort time with pen and ink, and in le&s;s than three hours added forty parts more to this &s;ong, upon which the Frenchman &s;wore in a great extacy that he mu&s;t be either the Devil or JOHN BULL.</P>
<P>Whether the mu&s;ician had heard of the &s;tory of ERASMUS and Sir THOMAS MORE, or whether as it has happened in many other ca&s;es he felt the influ|ence of JOHN BULL's &s;uperiority, has not exactly been a&s;certained, but the hi&s;torian in&s;i&s;ts that, though
<PB N="189" REF="195">
a prie&s;t, upon BULL's making him&s;elf known, he actually fell down and adored him.</P>
<P>DOWLAND, of whom SHAKESPEAR &s;peaks in one of his poems, was a good compo&s;er, and a fa|mous player on the lute. He was a great traveller, and his pa&s;&s;ion being mu&s;ic, he brought back the ta&s;te of other countries into this, and thus added &s;ome variety to the lighter compo&s;itions which were then the delight of all &s;ocieties.</P>
<P>PETER PHILIPS who becau&s;e he &s;tudied abroad italianized his name into PIETRO PHILIPPI, was con&s;idered as an admirable mu&s;ician. He certainly improved the Engli&s;h ta&s;te by &s;ending over airs from ITALY. Indeed ENGLAND was greatly obliged to the&s;e ramblers, for by importing now and then a little of the Italian ta&s;te they better guarded their countrymen again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Germans, who&s;e arithmetical mu&s;ic &s;ometimes gained ground, to the corruption of that truth and nature which in this country was at that time really felt and under&s;tood.</P>
<P>MORLEY, who was a pupil of BIRD, wrote a treati&s;e on mu&s;ic through which we get a good deal at the profe&s;&s;ors and admirers of that art, and their abilities and ta&s;te. It is written dialogue-wi&s;e; and
<PB N="190" REF="196">
in the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ations between the in|terlocutors, many particulars occur relative to the times, which clearly &s;hew the merit of mu&s;ic and the e&s;timation it was then held in.</P>
<P>MORLEY intends this treati&s;e for reproof as well as in&s;truction; for, knowing the inconvenience of &s;tudying &s;cientifically as it is called, how much it bewilders the imagination, and makes that a toil which only ought to be a plea&s;ure, he warns his &s;cholars again&s;t venturing too far.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"What would you learn?"</Q>
Says the ma&s;ter. The &s;cholar &s;ays he has heard a friend of his who is the be&s;t de&s;canter in the world, and begs he may be taught de&s;cant. The ma&s;ter an&s;wers that it will require time and pa|tience, that the word is hardly defined, and, in &s;hort, does what he can to di&s;&s;uade him from it, but to no purpo&s;e; de&s;cant was the foppery of mu&s;ic then, ju&s;t as cadence and the falcetto are now, and nothing will &s;atisfy the &s;cholar but de&s;cant.</P>
<P>What occa&s;ioned this treati&s;e was the madrigal, which was held in &s;uch e&s;timation that it was a reproach, as we have &s;een before, not to know how to take a part in it. Cards, and games of chance, were at that time totally unknown; and, without reproach to the pre&s;ent day, mu&s;ic was certainly a very inoffen&s;ive &s;ub&s;titute at lea&s;t. Thus innu|merable
<PB N="191" REF="197">
collections of the&s;e madrigals were given to the world by their re&s;pective authors, and this emulation, in the very way that was likely to make mu&s;ic generally known and admired, fixed its reputation.</P>
<P>MORLEY is very properly &s;evere on all tho&s;e innovators who, con&s;cious of their own ignorance, endeavour to prevent the true and natural operation of mu&s;ic. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Thus they go on,"</Q> &s;ays he, giving true definitions and fal&s;e examples; the example &s;till
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"importing the contrary to that which was &s;aid in the definition. But this is the world; every one will take upon him to write and teach others, none having more need of teaching than him&s;elf."</Q>
He fini&s;hes his treati&s;e with an account of thirty-nine different compo&s;ers, who had flouri&s;hed before and at the time of the reformation.</P>
<P>After the&s;e which I have mentioned, followed other mu&s;icians of eminence. BATHE wrote a trea|ti&s;e in which he did good towards the mea&s;urement of mu&s;ic. WEEKES and MUNDY compo&s;ed man|drigals which are yet known. FARNABY was a compo&s;er of &s;ome credit, and MILTON, the father of our celebrated epic poet, was from nature a mu|&s;ician. There are many things extant of his com|po&s;ition; among the re&s;t the celebrated p&s;alm tune
<PB N="192" REF="198">
called <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The York,"</Q> the melody of which is &s;o well known that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"half the nur&s;es in the kingdom,"</Q> &s;ays an author,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"have con&s;tantly u&s;ed it as a lullaby, and the chimes of many country churches have played it from time immemorial."</Q></P>
<P>BATESON, WYLBIE, BENNET, FARMER, and about thirteen others, al&s;o compo&s;ed and publi&s;hed madrigals, at the head of which &s;et ought to be placed ORLANDO GIBBONS, and MICHAEL ESTE, who&s;e particular merits may be re&s;orted to by a peru&s;al of &s;everal collections of madrigals, and in particular <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Triumphs of Oriana,"</Q> which was publi&s;hed in 1601.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. SCOTCH AND IRISH MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;o far digre&s;&s;ed to &s;peak of Engli&s;h mu&s;ic, I &s;hall, I hope, be pardoned if I take this opportu|nity of &s;aying &s;omething on the &s;ubject of Scotch and Iri&s;h mu&s;ic, in which I &s;hall take up, as briefly as po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome of the&s;e arguments which have been held out with a view to a&s;certain their origin, and add the be&s;t conjectures I have been able my&s;elf to form on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The common opinion as to the mu&s;ic of SCOT|LAND is that it was brought over from ITALY by RIZZIO. This cannot be altogether true, and yet I can &s;ee nothing to convince me that it is alto|gether fal&s;e. Tho&s;e who write in favour of this ar|gument &s;ay that RIZZIO, being retained in the &s;er|vice of the unfortunate MARY as a mu&s;ician, and finding the mu&s;ic of the country capable of improve|ment he &s;et him&s;elf down to give it poli&s;h and re|finement,
<PB N="194" REF="200">
keeping &s;till in view, as far as he could, without trenching on the rules of art, that imme|thodical and crude melody which he found in the country.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this it has been urged that the authority for the above a&s;&s;ertion re&s;ts merely on tradition, and that there is much written proof to refute it; that Sir JAMES MELVIL, who knew RIZZIO per|&s;onally, &s;ays he was nothing more than a merry fel|low and a good mu&s;ician; that he was drawn in &s;ometimes to &s;ing with the valets of the queen, and on that account, when her French &s;ecretary retired to FRANCE, RIZZIO was appointed &s;ecretary in his place.</P>
<P>MELVIL is obliged to allow however that RIZZIO engro&s;&s;ed the favour of the queen, that he was &s;u&s;|pected of being a pen&s;ioner to the Pope, and that by the part he took in all public tran&s;actions he gave ri&s;e to the troubles of SCOTLAND, and preci|pitated the ruin of his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>BUCHANAN confirms all this, and indeed goes more at large into the &s;ubject; and, from the&s;e premi&s;es it is inferred that the ambitious and intriguing &s;pirit of RIZZIO left him neither inclination nor opportunity for &s;tudy, and, therefore, that it was very unlikely
<PB N="195" REF="201">
he &s;hould attempt a reformation or improvement of the Scotch mu&s;ic, e&s;pecially as he had only two years to perform the ta&s;k in.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the&s;e arguments, as far as they have gone, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed there is nothing yet ad|vanced to &s;hew that RIZZIO did not improve the mu&s;ic of SCOTLAND. If MELVIL, who &s;peaking of his &s;uperficial character, finds him only a merry fellow and a good mu&s;ician is obliged to allow that he had this intriguing &s;pirit, that he was a pen&s;ioner of the Pope, and that he, in great mea&s;ure, occa|&s;ioned the troubles of SCOTLAND, is it very un|likely that his command over the queen aro&s;e from the opportunities he had of admini&s;tering to her plea|&s;ures, one of which was mu&s;ic? BUCHANAN &s;ays, that he became ab&s;orbed in the intrigues of the court, and ro&s;e to the highe&s;t degree of favour and confidence, in the management of which power he behaved with &s;uch arrogance and contempt, as to render him&s;elf odious to all about him.</P>
<P>During all this time, however, we do not find that he quitted his favourite lure, which little agreed with favour, confidence, and power. He was &s;till a &s;inger of madrigals and Scotch &s;ongs, and he was even at this employment when he was dragged from the queen and a&s;&s;a&s;inated.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202">But to go further with this examination. It is in&s;i&s;ted on that the origin of the Scotch melodies are to be derived from a higher &s;ource than RIZZIO without having recour&s;e to the Italians at all. I &s;hall tread this ground a little, though I fancy we &s;hall not find it very firm for the fir&s;t po&s;ition in which we &s;hall be obliged to &s;tand will be rather awkward, and what's wor&s;e dangerous.</P>
<P>We are told to believe an Italian writer who roundly a&s;&s;erts that &s;ome of the fine&s;t vocal mu&s;ic this country can boa&s;t of owes its merit, in a great mea&s;ure to its affinity with that of Scotland. He might have added, and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> becau&s;e none but exotic beauties are ever tran&s;planted. This argu|ment is &s;u&s;tained by a relation that JOHN, the arch|chanter from ROME, &s;ettled among the Northum|brians, and the propen&s;ity of that people to mu&s;ic, who&s;e &s;eque&s;tered &s;ituation, and the little intercour&s;e they mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have held with the ad|jacent countries, will account for a &s;tyle of mu&s;ic perfectly original, and which might, in proce&s;s of time, extend it&s;elf to the neighbouring kingdom.</P>
<P>Thus an Italian archchanter, who never in his life had heard a note of Scotch mu&s;ic, comes midway be|tween ENGLAND and SCOTLAND, delights the &s;e|que&s;tered inhabitants with a new kind of mu&s;ic he
<PB N="197" REF="203">
had brought with him, Italian of cour&s;e, and we are de&s;ired from this very clear account, given al&s;o by an Italian, to believe that not only the mu&s;ic he taught was natively Scotch, but that it &s;pread it&s;elf into ENGLAND, and improved the mu&s;ic there.</P>
<P>The real fact is evident and &s;tares us in the face. This archchanter to whom both nations are very much obliged, perfect in the principles of ZAR|LINO and PALESTRINO. improved both the native melodies of the Engli&s;h and the Scotch, which &s;ufficiently required it, and which could not take a brighter poli&s;h than from the Italian &s;chool.</P>
<P>A higher and more rational authority makes JAMES STUART, the fir&s;t of his name, and the hun|dred and &s;econd in the li&s;t of the kings of SCOT|LAND, author and compo&s;er of Scotch &s;ongs. BUCHANAN &s;ays that he was &s;killed in mu&s;ic more than was nece&s;&s;ary or fitting for a king, for there was no in&s;trument on which he could not play &s;o well as to contend with the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of the art in tho&s;e days.</P>
<P>That JAMES was a poet is univer&s;ally agreed; and, among many other authorities, ALESSANDRO TASSONI has this pa&s;&s;age in a work of his upon various &s;ubjects.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"We may reckon among the
<PB N="198" REF="204">
modern mu&s;icians JAMES, king of SCOTLAND, who not only compo&s;ed &s;acred poems &s;et to mu&s;ic, but al&s;o of him&s;elf invented a new melancholy and plaintive kind of mu&s;ic different from all other; in which he has been imitated by CARLO GESUALDO, prince of VENOSA, who in the&s;e our times has improved mu&s;ic with new and ad|mirable compo&s;itions."</Q></P>
<P>Now here is fairly a reciprocal intercour&s;e be|tween the Scotch and the Italian mu&s;ic, even back to the middle of the fifteenth century, when this poli&s;hed king could not be unknown to the family of ME|DICIS, or they to him. What does all this &s;ay, but that mu&s;ic, as well as every other &s;tudy is originally vernacular every where but, like intelligence of every kind, it acquires perfection by intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>JAMES did not invent Scotch mu&s;ic, nor did the archchanter, nor did RIZZIO, that is to &s;ay, the mu&s;ic which we at this moment call Scotch. The original mu&s;ic in SCOTLAND has been &s;imply but practically defined by every ma&s;ter who has, by way of a trick, taught his &s;cholar to hop over the &s;harps and the &s;lats of a harp&s;ichord. The accidental wildne&s;s with which this experiment impre&s;&s;es you I have no doubt gives a tolerably correct idea of the &s;tate of the Scotch mu&s;ic as it was found by JAMES;
<PB N="199" REF="205">
who, having natural ta&s;te, and an intercour&s;e with courts, refined it in &s;ome degree. After him comes JOHN, the archchanter, who rubs off a few more of the hardne&s;&s;es, and, at length, RIZZIO, who was an Italian mu&s;ician, and the &s;on of an Italian mu&s;ician, and he adds a new foreign poli&s;h in compliment to a queen who loved every thing that was foreign, and who was at that moment intriguing with foreign courts.</P>
<P>Thus I come to my fir&s;t po&s;ition, that the a&s;|&s;ertion of RIZZIO's have brought what is called Scotch mu&s;ic from Italy is not altogether true, nor altogether fal&s;e. The tunes which are be&s;t acknow|ledged and mo&s;t admired are clearly a mixture of Scotch and Italian. Have <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Tweed Side,"</Q> or
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"La&s;s of Patie's Mill,"</Q>
any thing in them of &s;kipping from &s;harps to flats? Nothing at all. They are &s;imple, beautiful, flowing melodies that, though grounded on the Scotch character, are treated in the Italian &s;tyle, which has benefited mu&s;ic all over the world, and will be ever the regulation for elegance in the hands of compo&s;ers, but of tho&s;e alone, who know to make u&s;e of Italian principles and not de&s;troy the native character of mu&s;ic in their own country.</P>
<P>As to the Iri&s;h mu&s;ic, there is no doubt but its
<PB N="100" REF="206">
native wildne&s;s has been in the &s;ame manner cor|rected by the introduction of Italian improvement, which it &s;eems to receive in even a more congenial manner than the Scotch. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Lango Lee,"</Q> and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The Dargle,"</Q>
are, as melodies, perhaps, equal to any thing in the world, but no one will a&s;&s;ert that any thing &s;o beautifully perfect, &s;o &s;atisfactory to the mind, can po&s;&s;ibly be natively Iri&s;h, crude and indige&s;ted; yet the Iri&s;h character is &s;o evident that without it all the true beauty of the air would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>It would be extremely ea&s;y to &s;hew, by in&s;tancing a number of airs, how the Engli&s;h and Scotch &s;tyle have been mixed together, the Scotch and Iri&s;h, the Iri&s;h and the Engli&s;h, and &s;ometimes all three, and with the &s;ame facility might it be made evident that the Italian &s;tyle has pervaded them all, but the attempt has hardly ever been undertaken by any man of real genius.</P>
<P>Thus having, by way of illu&s;trating my primary &s;ubject, a tre&s;pa&s;s for which I hope I &s;hall be par|doned, &s;hewn the &s;tate of the arts in ENGLAND at the death of ELIZABETH; when &s;cience, com|merce, and legi&s;lation, were at their highe&s;t pitch of grandeur, when divinity borrowed lu&s;tre from toleration, when law underwent regulation, when

<HEAD>CHAP. I. BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING &s;een how completely SHAKESPEAR &s;oared above all competition while he had only JONSON, CHAPMAN, MARLOE, MARSTON, and the re&s;t to encounter in the reign of ELIZABETH, let us &s;ee how well he kept his ground, when in addition to the&s;e, he had to cope with BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, MASSINGER, and other authors, who were candidates for dramatic fame during thirteen years of the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t, at the end of which time the world had the misfortune to lo&s;e our incomparable bard; a calamity which would have been irreparable had not po&s;terity lain its proud claim to his wonderful productions.</P>
<P>BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, with many fair preten&s;ions to theatrical reputation, never could
<PB N="204" REF="209">
fix a foundation &s;olid enough to e&s;tabli&s;h that &s;ort of fame which commands legitimate &s;uffiage upon the &s;pot, and challenges the award of po&s;terity. They were rather amateurs than writers, rather gen|tlemen than profe&s;&s;ors; yet has the &s;tage many ob|ligations to them which &s;hall be faithfully enu|merated.</P>
<P>BEAUMONT, who was well born and educated, was certainly a man of great talents and &s;ound judgment; which, however, would have been more manife&s;t in his works had not his career been all &s;peed without re&s;t. He died in 1615, a year be|fore the world lo&s;t SHAKESPEAR, at which time he had not attained his thirtieth year, and yet between 1607 and that time, a &s;pace of only eight years, he was concerned, as we are told, with FLETCHER in fifty-three plays.</P>
<P>FLETCHER was al&s;o well born and educated. He was ten years older than BEAUMONT, and lived ten years longer, but he does not &s;eem to have written any thing material either before or after his literary connection with that gentleman; for, in all we know of the works of the&s;e partners in fame, only a &s;ingle piece was written by each, that by BEAUMONT was called <HI>The Ma&s;que of Grays Inn,</HI> and that by FLETCHER, <HI>The Faithfull Shepherde&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="210">The &s;hare each took in their joint labours has been pretty well a&s;certained. BEAUMONT, who though the younge&s;t man had the &s;ounde&s;t judgment, formed and dige&s;ted the plots, wrote the more in|tere&s;ting and &s;erious parts, and pruned the lux|uriancies, of which there &s;eems to have been &s;uffi|cient need, for even at this moment when a revival of one of their plays is attempted it is obliged to be cut, even to mutilation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a well known anecdote which proves that FLETCHER had &s;ometimes a hand in forming their plots as well as BEAUMONT. Having concerted the plan of a tragedy over a bottle, they &s;ettled which part of the play they &s;hould re&s;pectively take; which, being perfectly adju&s;ted, <Q REND="inline">"Well,"</Q> &s;aid FLETCHER,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it &s;hall be &s;o, you manage the re&s;t and I'll undertake to kill the king."</Q>
The&s;e words being overheard by the waiter, they were pre&s;ently &s;urrounded and made pri&s;oners; but, their characters being well known, and their having it in their power ea&s;ily to prove that they only meditated the a&s;&s;a&s;ination of a theatrical monarch, the whole went off as a je&s;t.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Taken as dramatic productions, the works of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER can only be con&s;idered as having a partial claim to reputation. They have &s;trong particular merit, but, taking them altogether, there is &s;carcely a play but is extravagant, wild, and ill managed. Mo&s;t of the plots are Spani&s;h, and &s;eems as if they thought that when they had lopped off part of the luxuriance of <HI>Lopez de Vega,</HI> they had done enough, whereas they &s;hould not have left
<PB N="206" REF="211">
a twig, but have let the new &s;hoots have gained their &s;trength by &s;pringing at once from the &s;tock.</P>
<P>This, however, was not the ca&s;e. FLETCHER not only added to the extravagance of the Spaniard wild and excentric wit of his own, but perpetually tinctured it with ob&s;cenity, and the operation has been, that, whenever the manners at any period &s;ince that time have been loo&s;e and profligate, BEAUMONT and FLETCHER have been the reigning favourites, witne&s;s the e&s;timation in which they were held in the reign of CHARLES the &s;econd, when, an indelible di&s;grace to that monarch and his court, they obtained even to the exclu&s;ion of SHAKES|PEAR. But let us take a cur&s;ory review of their works.</P>
<P><HI>The Woman Hater,</HI> a comedy which appeared in 1607, is a play of &s;ome merit, it is &s;trange that two writers &s;hould &s;tart with a piece the principal cha|racter in which, if it is not, ought to be out of na|ture. BEAUMONT is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been almo&s;t wholly the author of this production. It was pretty &s;ucce&s;sful, both when it came out and afterwards when it was revived by &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT.</P>
<P><HI>The Knight of the burning Pe&s;tle,</HI> a &s;trange play which has &s;ome beauties and a thou&s;and defects,
<PB N="207" REF="212">
was produced in 1611. Its grand fault is, that, like JONSON <HI>Every Man out of his Humour,</HI> it was con|veyed to the audience through the medium of a grex. This play was revived after the re&s;toration with a new prologue &s;poken by NEL GWYN, at which time licentiou&s;ne&s;s was a &s;trong recommen|dation to public favour, but it had never any ma|terial &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Cupid's Revenge,</HI> a tragedy, performed by the Children of the Revels, contained &s;ome very good poetry, but the plot and machinery were &s;o ab|&s;urd and ridiculous that it had but very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>The Scornful Lady,</HI> a comedy brought out in 1616, is a production of &s;ome merit, and has more regularity than is generally found in the plays of the&s;e authors. There is &s;omething, however, very inartificial in the management of the plot, and parti|cularly the conver&s;ion of MORECRAFT the u&s;urer, which is certainly forced and unnatural.</P>
<P><HI>King and no King,</HI> a tragedy, performed in 1619, has been variou&s;ly critici&s;ed. RYMER has handled it very &s;everely, for which, taking it altogether as a play, he had but too much rea&s;on. DRYDEN has been, however, le&s;s har&s;h; and, indeed the general
<PB N="208" REF="213">
objections again&s;t the plays of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, being the extraneous matter and hu|mour introduced into their plots, and the licentiou&s;|ne&s;s of their wit, which DRYDEN, was obliged a good deal to conform to, might occa&s;ion him to be as merciful as po&s;&s;ible, and to &s;eperate the morali&s;t from the critic, le&s;t in ca&s;tigating them he &s;hould whip him&s;elf; while RYMER, who was bound by no &s;uch con&s;ideration, reprobated what was unworthy without he&s;itation.</P>
<P><HI>The Maid's Tragedy,</HI> produced in 1622. Its &s;ucce&s;s both then and &s;ince has been reputable. It has, however, &s;o much of that extravagance and ir|regularity for which the&s;e authors are remarkable, that it has been a &s;tranger to the &s;tage for many years.</P>
<P><HI>Thierry and Theodoret,</HI> performed in 1621. This is one of the&s;e hetrogeneous compo&s;itions of which there are too many in the works of the&s;e authors. It has ten blemi&s;hes for one beauty, and upon the whole is poorly con&s;tructed, and but indifferently written.</P>
<P><HI>Phila&s;ter.</HI> This tragedy came out in 1622, and added con&s;iderably to the reputation of the&s;e au|thors. Indeed it has always been ju&s;tly e&s;teemed
<PB N="209" REF="214">
a work of con&s;iderable merit, and by many has been thought the be&s;t in all the catalogue of their works. On this account it has been revived, with alterations by the bye, at various periods. DRYDEN wrote a prologue when it was performed wholly by women at Lincoln Inn Fields, and SETTLE re-wrote the two la&s;t acts and brought it out in 1695. But the be&s;t opportunity <HI>Phila&s;ter</HI> had for fame and &s;ucce&s;s was when COLMAN altered it to bring forward POWELL and Mrs. YATES, the particulars of which we &s;hall hereafter go into. With all the&s;e advantages, how|ever, <HI>Phila&s;ter,</HI> from its own merit, has never been able to keep the &s;tage for rea&s;ons of a piece with all the re&s;t, becau&s;e it is full of beauties and defects, becau&s;e there is not one regular &s;imple grand in|tere&s;t excited, and becau&s;e it is ingeniou&s;ly made up of pieces in&s;tead of being one general whole.</P>
<P><HI>The two Noble Kin&s;men.</HI> This play is &s;aid to have been written by SHAKESPEAR and FLETCHER, a circum&s;tance which the editor of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER &s;eems to be greatly concerned about, probably out of tenderne&s;s for the reputation of FLETCHER, but he need not have made him&s;elf in the &s;malle&s;t degree unea&s;y, for the play it&s;elf &s;uffi|ciently proves that SHAKESPEAR had no hand in it.
<PB N="210" REF="215">
Indeed there is not much reputation to be claimed by any body, for the &s;tory is CHAUCER<HI>'s Knights Tale,</HI> which we have &s;een already treated by ED|WARDS to the great delight of queen ELIZABETH. There is &s;omething, however, gaudy and fine in it; and, like mo&s;t of the works of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, it re&s;embles a parterre appearing &s;o full of colours that form, and &s;ymetry are not once thought of. This play is &s;aid to have been originally produced in 1634, an incongruity that is not very ea&s;ily reconcileable, becau&s;e BEAU|MONT died in 1615, and FLETCHER in 1625, and yet it is as difficult to believe that the plays pro|duced by the&s;e a&s;&s;ociates were performed during the life time of BEAUMONT, or even of FLETCHER, being fifty-three in number, and the term for the performance of them being only eight years in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and but eighteen in the la&s;t. I &s;hall &s;et down the dates, however, according to the be&s;t authorities, and the&s;e I take to be when they were fir&s;t publi&s;hed, not when they were fir&s;t performed.</P>
<P><HI>The Elder Brother,</HI> the date 1637. This play, which is originally Spani&s;h, is &s;trangely and wildly treated by BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, and indeed would have &s;unk long ago into oblivion had not CIBBER taken it for one of the plots of his <HI>Love</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="216">
<HI>makes a Man,</HI> a play we &s;hall hereafter examine. The ground work is good, but the whole merit is due to the original writer.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Thomas,</HI> the date 1639. Here we have &s;ome clue to &s;et us right as to the time the pieces of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER were performed, but we cannot much rely on any thing we learn of the&s;e authors, for fir&s;t we are told that they wrote con|jointly all the plays publi&s;hed in their works, except <HI>The Ma&s;que of Grays Inn,</HI> and <HI>The Faithful Shep|herde&s;s;</HI> we are afterward told that they were a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by SHAKESPEAR, by JONSON, by MID|DLETON, and other writers, and even this play FLETCHER is &s;aid to have written after the death of BEAUMONT. There is nothing, however, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance worth contending for. It is a very indifferent play, and, though publi&s;hed with great care by BROOME after FLETCHER's death, who dedicated it to COTTON, a great admirer of the author, and afterwards altered and got up by DURFEY, under the title of <HI>Trick for Trick,</HI> it never had &s;ucce&s;s. My drift is that, as this piece was originally brought out after the death of FLETCHER, &s;o very probably many of the other productions were al&s;o, and this would a good deal invalidate the a&s;&s;ertion that BEAUMONT was concerned in &s;o many
<PB N="212" REF="217">
of tho&s;e plays, writing as they did very often for the moment, and being both of them the &s;ort of character not very likely to lay in a &s;tore of ma|terials. This conjecture, however, we &s;hall have opportunity more clo&s;ely to examine as we go on.</P>
<P><HI>Wit without Money,</HI> the date 1639. This co|medy, being written with le&s;s extravagance and clo&s;er to nature than the pieces of the&s;e authors in general, it has longer kept the &s;tage. There is, how|ever, a flimzine&s;s in it that has always prevented it from being attractive. The comic mu&s;e that pre|&s;ided over the labours of the&s;e writers &s;eems to have been one of tho&s;e ladies who are for ever either &s;ad, or in hy&s;terics. She &s;eems to be unac|quainted with a &s;mile, the re&s;ult of feeling, and the recommendation of the heart, &s;he is either muzzed with a vapid &s;imper, or convul&s;ed with a broad grin, and under this influence, when the&s;e gentlemen have attempted at mere nature, they have not been able to pre&s;erve the milk in its native &s;tate; their a&s;perity having turned it, by which means their hu|mour is either hard like the curd, or mawki&s;h like the whey. This play is a proof of it, which is well conceived and full of nature, but the circum&s;tances are not wrought high enough, nor do the characters &s;ufficiently come out of the canva&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="218"><HI>Rollo Duke of Normandy,</HI> the date 1640. This tragedy is &s;aid to have been received with very great applau&s;e when it fir&s;t appeared. It has, how|ever, been long con&s;igned to oblivion, and in|deed ju&s;tly, for it is a turgid imitation of SENECA and JONSON, without fancy or &s;pirit, or, indeed, any thing but heavy, declamatory dialogue, una&s;|&s;i&s;ted by force or intere&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Rule a Wife and Have a Wife,</HI> the date 1640. This play is well known, being one of the very few of tho&s;e written by BEAUMONT and FLETCHER which are now upon the theatrical &s;tock li&s;t; intrin|&s;ically, however, this piece is no great acqui&s;ition to the theatre, and it is at the ri&s;k of a thin hou&s;e that it is ever performed, unle&s;s bol&s;tered up with a new LEON, or an ESTIFANIA. The plot of this play though admirably imagined is poorly treated. There is &s;omething very well, if it went no further, in re|claiming a vain coquette by placing her in the hands of a brave and manly hu&s;band, but MAR|GUERETTA is an avowed wanton, whom it would have been a di&s;grace to a man of &s;uch a de&s;cription to have married, and after all LEON's claim to the&s;e noble qualities is very ill grounded, for he is the brother of his wife's waiting maid, and he tricks MARGUERETTE into the marriage by per&s;onating
<PB N="214" REF="219">
an idiot, an art which a man of his &s;pirit and honour would have di&s;dained. This has evidently thrown the authors into an unplea&s;ant predicament towards the end of the play; for, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to excu&s;e them&s;elves naturally, they try to hu&s;h up both the infamy of their heroine, and their own want of judgment in a &s;ummary way. Thus after MARGUETTA has played a hundred indecent tricks, and endeavoured to make her hu&s;band's hou&s;e a brothel, with all the forgiving good nature in the world, he takes her up and
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"wears her next his heart."</Q></P>
<P>The &s;cenes of the COPPER CAPTAIN and ESTI|FANIA, have a better claim to prai&s;e. They are highly comic, and the equivoque of the hou&s;e which mixes the epi&s;ode with the main de&s;ign, is the happie&s;t thing in the piece. It is impo&s;&s;ible to pa&s;s over this article without uniting &s;ome degree, of pity with contempt at the fond idea of the&s;e authors, who in CACCAFOGO imagined they had outdone FALSTAFF.</P>
<P><HI>The Mad Lover.</HI> This play as well as <HI>Rule a Wife and Have a Wife,</HI> and all the re&s;t that will now follow, were collected into an edition and pub|li&s;hed in 1647, &s;o that it will be impo&s;&s;ible to know
<PB N="215" REF="220">
when they actually made their fir&s;t appearance, nor is it material.</P>
<P><HI>The Mad Lover,</HI> which play &s;ir ASTON COCKAIN has highly commended in a copy of ver&s;es, is never|thele&s;s a work of but mediocre merit, We know but little of its &s;ucce&s;s, and, indeed, it does not appear to have been at any time very familiar with the &s;tage. It is partly borrowed from <HI>Mundus and Paulina</HI> in <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Spani&s;h Curate.</HI> This play is a hetrogeneous jumble in the &s;ame &s;tyle of many others in this col|lection. It has been pruned, altered, and amended, and fitted to the &s;tage frequently by different au|thors, but never with any thing like &s;ucce&s;s, and yet there are good materials in it. It is taken from the <HI>Don John,</HI> and the <HI>Spani&s;h Curate,</HI> of GERARDO.</P>
<P><HI>The Little French Lawyer.</HI> This comedy is a mixture of the <HI>Spani&s;h Rogue,</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis de Ca&s;tro,</HI> and <HI>Don Roderigo de Montalva,</HI> which SCAR|RON has al&s;o treated in his <HI>Fruitle&s;s Precaution,</HI> and the <HI>Complai&s;ant Companion,</HI> but this could not have been early enough to have been of any u&s;e, as &s;ome imagine, to BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, BEAU|MONT having died when SCARRON was only five years old.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="221"><HI>The Cu&s;tom of the Country.</HI> This tragic-comedy, as it is called, has a&s;&s;i&s;ted other authors but never did any thing for its own. CIBBER u&s;ed part of it for <HI>Love makes a Man,</HI> and CHARLES JOHNSON formed out of it his <HI>Country La&s;&s;es.</HI> It is a &s;trange wild thing but full of good materials. Its great fault is ob&s;cenity. DRYDEN &s;ays in one of his pre|faces, by way of an&s;wer to tho&s;e who accu&s;ed him of indecency.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. CONTINUATION OF BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The Noble Gentleman.</HI> This comedy was little known till it was revived by DURFEY, under the title of <HI>The Three Dukes of Dun&s;table,</HI> and then it was only &s;tirred up to make its &s;tench more intolerable. &s;ir GEORGE ETHERIDGE, in a letter to the duke of BUCKINGHAM, &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"By my la&s;t packet from EN|GLAND, among a heap of nau&s;eous tra&s;h, I re|ceived the Three Dukes of Dun&s;table, which is really &s;o mon&s;trous and in&s;ipid that I am &s;orry LAPLAND, or LIVONIA, had not the honour of producing it; but, if I did pennance in reading it, I rejoice to hear that it was &s;olemnly interred to the tune of Cat Calls."</Q></P>
<P><HI>The Captain,</HI> a comedy of very &s;lender merit, has been &s;ometimes attempted on the &s;tage, but the effort was always &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful that it has long been lain by as unfit for &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223"><HI>Beggar's Bu&s;h.</HI> What &s;ucce&s;s this play had originally is not known. It was altered and brought out under the title of the <HI>Royal Merchant,</HI> by NORRIS, the comedian, in 1706, and in that &s;tate occa&s;ionally performed. In 1768 it was made into an opera by Mr. HULL, the mu&s;ic by Mr. LINLEY. It had no great &s;ucce&s;s, but the words and mu&s;ic of &s;ome of the &s;ongs were again brought forward and introduced into the <HI>Camp,</HI> an entertainment per|formed with great &s;ucce&s;s in 1778, and attributed to Mr. SHERIDAN; but, that every bird of Parna&s;&s;us may be allowed his own plumage, the &s;ongs above mentioned, which were con&s;idered as indifferently written at Covent Garden in the Royal Merchant, were found admirable afterwards at Drury Lane in the Camp, are not the production of Mr. SHERI|DAN, but of Mr. HULL.</P>
<P><HI>The Coxcomb.</HI> This comedy may rank with The Captain. Its revival has been attempted but to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>The Fal&s;e One.</HI> This tragedy is founded on CLEOPATRA's incon&s;tancy to JULIUS CAESAR in EGYPT, and taken from SUETONIUS, PLUTARCH, and other authors, who wrote of tho&s;e times. It has &s;ome &s;trong writing, but upon the whole it is a bad play.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="224"><HI>The Chances.</HI> This is a comedy borrowed from The Lady Cornelia of Cervantes, and has been by various authors altered and brought on the theatre. The duke of BUCKINGHAM's alteration was a very judicious one. He kept the hurry and perplexity of the plot much more clear than it had been originally, but after all it has much more to beget curio&s;ity than to create intere&s;t, and the indelicacy that per|vades the piece, and the libertini&s;m throughout the whole character of DON JOHN, render it a mo&s;t im|proper and reprehen&s;ible &s;ubject for the &s;tage; nor could GARKICK's incomparable performance of this character, though he had again weeded it, &s;carcely ju&s;tify our attention to it.</P>
<P><HI>The Loyal Subject.</HI> This tragedy is a poor pro|duction. It would not be worth while to examine it, and indeed it has lain &s;o long a&s;leep that it were pity to awake it. <HI>The Laws of Candy,</HI> a tragi-comedy by the&s;e authors, has been a great while in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and &s;o let it remain. <HI>The Lover's Progre&s;s</HI> has no better preten&s;ion to our notice. It is taken from a French romance called <HI>Ly&s;ander and Cali&s;ta,</HI> written by DAUDIGUIER, and to the &s;ame peaceful oblivion we may al&s;o con&s;ign the <HI>I&s;land Prince&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Humouous Lieutenant.</HI> This play has been
<PB N="220" REF="225">
performed at different times with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. The principal part of the plot is taken from PLU|TARCH's Life of DEMETRIUS, and the Lieutenant's refu&s;ing to fight after he has been cured of his wounds, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;tory of LUCULLUS's &s;oldier, related by HORACE. This is a play of that flighty kind which the&s;e authors &s;o frequently produced, and is neither full enough of intere&s;t or regularity to claim a permanent &s;ituation in the theatre.</P>
<P><HI>Nice Valour; or the Pa&s;&s;ionate Madman.</HI> This comedy is one of the wor&s;t pieces in the whole catalogue.</P>
<P><HI>The Maid in the Mill.</HI> This play has been &s;ometimes revived, but its &s;ucce&s;s has never repaid the pains of tho&s;e who have brought it forward. The plot of ANTONIO ISMENIA, and AMINTA, is borrowed from GIRARDO, and OTRANTE &s;eizing FLORIMEL, the &s;uppo&s;ed daughter of the miller, is taken from an Italian novel written by BANDELLO, which was afterwards tran&s;lated into French. There is much good writing in this piece; but there is &s;omething &s;o radically wrong in its con&s;truction that in&s;tead of mending it, the author, as the chair|man &s;aid to POPE,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"had better had made two new ones."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="226"><HI>The Prophete&s;s.</HI> This tragical hi&s;tory, as it is called, is founded on the well known &s;tory of DIOCIESIAN, to whom it was foretold by a pro|phete&s;s that he &s;hould be emperor of ROME when he &s;hould have killed a mighty boar; which pre|diction was fulfilled by his putting to death the tyrant APER. This extraordinary production has been brought on the &s;tage in a variety of &s;hapes, and in particular in the form of an opera by BET|TERTON, in 1690, embelli&s;hed by PURCELL's mu|&s;ic; but it has always been &s;ound &s;o undramatic, and &s;o little intere&s;ting, that upon the&s;e occa&s;ions all the expence has been thrown away.</P>
<P><HI>Bonduca.</HI> This queen of ICENE, who was indiffer|ently called by hi&s;torians BONDUCA, or BOADICEA, has been frequently the &s;ubject of a play. This of BEAUMONT and PLETCHER is the earlie&s;t and upon the whole the be&s;t; for it is full of pithy, nervous writing and good intere&s;t, the misfortunes of that ill fated prince&s;s being remarkably touching and well calculated for the &s;tage. It, however, has never done any thing material, even when it has been ju|diciou&s;ly altered. Mr. COLMAN, with great judge|ment and a proper tenderne&s;s for the reputation of the&s;e authors, brought it out on his theatre in the Haymarket, in 1778; but it has been &s;eldom re|&s;umed,
<PB N="222" REF="227">
and it is now lain by with but little pro&s;pect of being brought forward again.</P>
<P><HI>The Sea Voyage.</HI> The de&s;ign of this comedy is borrowed from SHAKESPEAR's Tempe&s;t, and has in it &s;ome good things, not good enough, however, to cope with the original; and, as if the failure was not di&s;graceful enough to the authors, DURFEY revived it with alterations which made it ten times wor&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>The Double Marriage</HI> is a very indifferent play. It has been frequently revived, but, though DU|FREY lent a hand to &s;poil it, nothing re&s;ulted from the attempt but di&s;appointment.</P>
<P><HI>The Pilgrim.</HI> This excentric comedy has a great deal of merit. It originally received great applau&s;e, and has been often &s;ucce&s;sfully revived. In 1700, &s;ir JOHN VANBRUGH brought it out at Drury Lane Theatre, with a Prologue and DRY|DEN's Secular Ma&s;que, which was the la&s;t of that great poet's works; but which, for what it is, abounds with brilliant poetry. It was revived again at Drury Lane without &s;ucce&s;s; but about the year 1762, it was brought out at Covent Garden with con&s;iderable reputation. Since that time it has been very &s;eldom repeated.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="228"><HI>The Woman's Prize; or, the Tamer tamed.</HI> This play, which is &s;aid to have been written by FLETCHER alone, after the death of BEAUMONT, &s;o that the reader will &s;ee how weak all the autho|rities are upon this &s;ubject, is intended as a &s;equel to SHAKESPEAR's Taming of the Shrew. CATHE|RINE being dead, PETRUCHIO is married to a young woman of a mild and gentle di&s;po&s;ition, who, in conjunction with &s;ome female companions, de|termine to break the temper of her hu&s;band, which is at length effected; in con&s;equence of which he blindly &s;ubmits him&s;elf to her will and &s;he rules him as &s;he thinks proper.</P>
<P>Nothing is &s;o ea&s;y as to &s;ee that a play cannot be framed upon wor&s;e principles. The conduct of PETRUCHIO though violent is laudable, becau&s;e rea&s;onable &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is not only the duty but en|&s;ures the comfort of a wife, and, therefore, a proper &s;ubject for a poet to treat. Blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in a hu&s;band, which mu&s;t render him ridiculous to his friends, and an object of contempt even to his wife, is upon the &s;ame principle very improper matter for the &s;tage; be&s;ides the author of this play has wholly mi&s;taken the character of PETRUCHIO. So far from being of a tyrannical temper, he is generous and noble; his violence is all put on, all a&s;&s;umed;
<PB N="224" REF="229">
and, from the moment he has carried his point and re&s;tored CATHERINE to her&s;elf, to him, and to her family, he <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"doffs the lordly hu&s;band."</Q> Time, however, who, as SHAKESPEAR &s;ays,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"tries all old offenders,"</Q>
has &s;ettled the di&s;pute, for, while the Tamer tamed lies quietly interred with many of the family, CATHERINE and PETRUCHIO lives to afford us in&s;truction and amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><HI>An Hone&s;t Man's Fortune,</HI> part of which is taken from HEYWOOD's hi&s;tory of Women, Love's Cure, and The Knight of Malta, are pieces which help to fill up the catalogue of the&s;e authors, but, though there is &s;ome good writing in each of them, they have very little claim to dramatic merit. To the&s;e may be added the <HI>Queen of Corinth</HI> which &s;tands in the &s;ame predicament.</P>
<P><HI>Women Plea&s;ed.</HI> The &s;ubject of this play has employed the pens of many authors, three of the different novels of BOCCACE having &s;omething to do with it; but the ground work is in CHAUCER's Wife of Bath's Tale, which VOLTAIRE has &s;ucce&s;s|fully treated under the title of <HI>Ce qui plait aux Dames.</HI> This was afterwards brought on the French &s;tage by FAVART, and called <HI>La Fee Urgelle,</HI> and and at length taken by GARRICK for the &s;ubject of
<PB N="225" REF="230">
&s;ubject of his <HI>Chri&s;tmas Tale.</HI> This is certainly a piece of merit; but as the &s;ubject has been fre|quently tried and never to any effect without the auxiliary a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;cenery and mu&s;ic, and, in|deed, romantic and fanciful tales are not at all cal|culated for comedy which &s;hould depict true, fair, and natural manners, <HI>Women Plea&s;ed,</HI> in the &s;tate it came out of the hands of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, has never been fortunate enough to plea&s;e an audience.</P>
<P><HI>A Wife for a Month.</HI> This tragi-comedy, a de&s;cription which always implies &s;omething hetro|geneous, has &s;ome good traits. It is partly bor|rowed from the hi&s;tory of SANCHO the eighth, of LEON. The misfortune of this &s;ort of production is that the two plots are &s;o di&s;tinct they cannot lend one another intere&s;t; and, take them &s;ingly, they have not &s;trength enough to &s;upport them&s;elves, therefore let them be written ever &s;o well they can|not have the effect of a play upon a &s;ubject in which if any thing is introduced it is kept &s;ubordinate, and &s;o con&s;tructed as to a&s;&s;i&s;t the general de&s;ign. Un|fortunately this does not happen to be the merit of this play, nor, indeed, &s;carcely any tragi-comedy written by the&s;e authors.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="231"><HI>The Fair Maid of the Inn</HI> is a tragi-comedy, and &s;tands in &s;omething like the &s;ame predicament as <HI>A Wife for a Month.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wit at &s;everal Weapons,</HI> in which there is &s;ome whim, did very little it&s;elf, but has &s;erved as ma|terials for other plays, particularly for &s;ir WILLIAM DAVENANT, who borrowed a good deal of it for his play called <HI>The Wits.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Valentinian.</HI> This is a tragedy, a &s;pecies of per|formance in which BEAUMONT and FLETCHER have been lea&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful; this tragedy, however, is &s;aid to have been well received when it fir&s;t came out.

fir&s;t of which may be called tragi-comedies, the third a tragedy, and the fourth an opera, are princi|pally taken from BOCCACE, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be performed before MANUEL, king of PORTUGAL, and his queen ISABELLA, at the celebration of their nuptials, the court being introduced as &s;pectators, and the king and queen making remarks on the re|pre&s;entation. It is, however, mo&s;t probable that this curious medley was never performed at all.</P>
<P><HI>The Wild Goo&s;e Cha&s;e.</HI> This play has con&s;iderable merit, but it is like the re&s;t ill conducted. The materials, however, have been found very u&s;eful; FARQUHAR has borrowed almo&s;t four acts of <HI>The Incon&s;tant</HI> from it.</P>
<P>The&s;e plays, <HI>The Widow, The Jeweller of Am&s;ter|dam, The Faithful Friend, A Right Woman,</HI> and <HI>The Hi&s;tory of Mador, King of Britain</HI> are all &s;aid to have been written by the&s;e wits, either &s;ingly, toge|ther, or in conjunction with others, but how they were actually employed on them remains a &s;ecret which will be, probably, never divulged, nor is it very material whether it be or not.</P>
<P>I &s;hall yet employ, however, a few words upon the &s;ubject of the&s;e authors, who&s;e labours, though they may have failed as to regularity, and have
<PB N="228" REF="233">
been weak on the &s;ide of judgment, are, notwith|&s;tanding, meritorious, and breathe in various in|&s;tances &s;pirit and genius. The mi&s;take &s;eems to have been an endeavour to &s;oar beyond what nature qualified them for. The genius of SHAKESPEAR, being exten&s;ive enough to gra&s;p at real and imagi|nary worlds, they vainly conceived they might endeavour at the &s;ame track; but, in their fond ne&s;s, they were Ixions, and in their pre&s;umption Phaetons.</P>
<P>BEAUMONT is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the cor|recte&s;t judgment of the two, and FLETCHER the &s;tronge&s;t genius, and we are even told, that JONSON u&s;ed to &s;ubmit his works to the opinion and cor|rection of BEAUMONT; this, however, after what we have witne&s;&s;ed of CHAPMAN, DECKER, and others whom this hard cynic envied and abu&s;ed, it is extremely difficult to believe; for, if BEAUMONT had &s;uch con&s;ummate judgment he certainly would have u&s;ed it in the con&s;truction of his own plays, the plots of which are the crude&s;t and mo&s;t indige&s;ted that can be po&s;&s;ibly be conceived; and, as to the judgment of JONSON, it is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay that it was his greate&s;t merit, and that there is more good &s;en&s;e in the con&s;truction of <HI>Every Man in his Hu|mour</HI> than in that of all the works of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER put together.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="234">All that is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay on the &s;ubject may be comprized in this. The indu&s;try with which BEAUMONT and FLETCHER explored the works of the Spaniards and others for dramatic materials has been of &s;uch benefit to the Engli&s;h &s;tage, that it not only lent material a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards bringing it into great forwardne&s;s, but &s;erved as a ground work for others, who have &s;ince derived much of their &s;ucce&s;s from having had recour&s;e to their labours.</P>
<P>As to their particular merits they were both good writers, and would have been better had they not perpetually tried to go beyond the bounds that nature and genius pre&s;cribed them, had they not written too ha&s;tily, had they not given into an un|bridled wit which grew to licentiou&s;ne&s;s and de&s;troyed the legitimate drift of their productions, had they not, in &s;hort, arrogated a fal&s;e con&s;equence and ri|diculou&s;ly fancied them&s;elves &s;uperior to a man, whom they might have been proud to have followed at an humble di&s;tance.</P>
<P>As to the &s;hare they had re&s;pectively in tho&s;e productions which are publi&s;hed with their joint names, I have already &s;hewn that whatever has been conjectured on the &s;ubject &s;eems to have a very falacious air. That BEAUMONT could have been concerned in fifty three plays in eight years appears
<PB N="230" REF="235">
to be impo&s;&s;ible. It is as certainly impo&s;&s;ible that &s;o large a number could have been brought out during that time, and it is very unlikely that BEAU|MONT left behind him, he who was a writer for the moment, materials for the greate&s;t part of the&s;e plays; but, as we have no proof that what has been a&s;&s;erted on this &s;ubject is fal&s;e, though it is a little contradictory, we are compelled &s;o far to acquie&s;ce as to give our verdict according to the evidence.</P>
<P>One proud fact, however, the labours of the&s;e writers and their cotemporaries have a&s;certained. All this contention for pre-eminence that was mani|fe&s;ted, all the&s;e valuable dramatic materials that were produced, and all this rapid improvement to which the &s;tage had ari&s;en, had been confirmed be|fore the French theatre, that has always arrogantly affected to lead ours, boa&s;ted a &s;ingle line from the great CORNEILLE, or any one of his &s;atelites and before MOLIERE and RACINE were born. Who then can deny that, having &s;o perfect a model be|fore them as the Engli&s;h &s;tage, they made it an ob|ject of their imitation? But that there may be no cavil this &s;hall hereafter be inconte&s;tibly proved.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. MASSINGER.</HEAD>
<P>IF, in BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, we lament that authors &s;ometimes attempt too much, in MAS|SINGER, we have a proof that they may do too little. This very charming writer has &s;eldom been allowed the merit he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, perhaps, becau&s;e he was a &s;tranger to pre&s;umption, vanity, and tho&s;e other qualities which often procure for an author more fame than he de&s;erves; po&s;terity, however, generally &s;ets the matter right; which, in the opi|nions of all judges of genius and ta&s;te, has placed MASSINGER very little behind JONSON, and far before BEAUMONT and FLETCHER.</P>
<P>MASSINGER, by the patronage of the earl of MONTGOMERY, under whom his father had an ho|nourable employ, and afterwards the earl of PEM|BROKE, was encouraged in his youth to pur&s;ue polite literature; which, coming in con&s;onance with a beautiful and refined genius which he inherited from
<PB N="232" REF="237">
nature, he &s;oon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the qualities for a writer of correct ta&s;te and brilliant fancy.</P>
<P>The &s;tage attracted his attention, and was, in|deed, the very field for the exerci&s;e of his abilities. He had invention and ingenuity, he knew nature and character; his &s;tyle, while it was warm and &s;ervid, was, neverthele&s;s, pure and decorous, and even went beyond the times in which he wrote for poli&s;h and refinement; for he was as &s;trong as JONSON without being dull, and as elegant as WALLER with|out being mawki&s;h; but, to give the proude&s;t proof of the genius of MASSINGER, you &s;ee a great deal of the mind of SHAKESPEAR in him, though he has never &s;ervilely imitated him, nor arrogantly at|tempted to &s;oar after him to tho&s;e heights which his genius alone could reach. But let us examine his plays.</P>
<P><HI>The Virgin Martyr.</HI> This play was fir&s;t acted, as we are told, in 1622, at which time MASSINGER was thirty-eight years old. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by DECKER in this production, which, perhaps, might better have been let alone, but his mode&s;ty too often prevented him from feeling his own con&s;e|quence. <HI>The Virgin Martyr</HI> is taken from the <HI>Mar|tylogies of the per&s;ecution in the time of</HI> DIOCLESIAN; and, though there is &s;ome fine writing in it, it is evi|dently
<PB N="233" REF="238">
a work of inexperience, and, therefore, had no great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>The Duke of Milan.</HI> Here our author had fairer play for his genius. This tragedy was per|formed in 1623 with good &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;cene where in&s;tructions are given by SFORZA to his fa|vourite FRANCISCO for the murder of MARCELIA, is wrought up very ma&s;terly, and I have no doubt but this very play has a&s;&s;i&s;ted the various <HI>Mariamnes</HI> of the French &s;tage, from TRISTAN to VOLTAIRE, that &s;tory from the Hi&s;tory of the Jews having been the foundation of <HI>The Duke of Milan.</HI> Indeed the circum&s;tances are &s;o &s;imilar that Mr. CUMBER|BERLAND very laudably was induced to blend this play and FENTON's <HI>Mariamne</HI> together; but pro|bably from his unwillingne&s;s to encroach upon the writing of either of the&s;e authors, it appeared not to be of a piece, and, therefore, did not &s;ucceed.</P>
<P><HI>The Bondman,</HI> acted at the Cock Pit, Drury Lane, 1623. This is a tragedy of great merit. The plot is full of truth and con&s;i&s;tency, and the writing is &s;trong and nervous. The incident of bringing back the rebellious &s;laves to their duty with whips, is in the true&s;t &s;pirit of the drama, and is here u&s;ed to great advantage. <HI>The Bondman</HI> has been fre|quently
<PB N="234" REF="239">
revived, and particularly by Mr. CUMBER|LAND in 1779, at Covent Garden theatre. This was certainly a very judicious alteration, and it was highly &s;poken of by the critics, but it did not &s;ucceed to the degree that was rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P><HI>The Roman Actor</HI> was performed at Black Friars in 1629. It was MASSINGER's greate&s;t favourite among all his works, and the writers of that time were &s;o far of the &s;ame opinion that no le&s;s than &s;ix copies of commendatory ver&s;es were prefixed to it. Indeed its &s;ucce&s;s was very decided, both originally and when it was revived by BETTERTON, who ren|dered him&s;elf very celebrated in the principal cha|racter. There is certainly a dignity in the conduct of the piece, and the language is charming.</P>
<P><HI>The Renegado.</HI> This is a tragi-comedy and was performed in 1630, at Drury Lane. This play was recommended by complimentary ver&s;es like the former, and certainly has much merit, but it has the fault of all tragi-comedies. The plots hang in|congruou&s;ly together, and, therefore, each deprives the other of the approbation that would el&s;e be due to them.</P>
<P><HI>The Picture,</HI> performed in 1630, at the Globe, and Black Friars. This admirable production,
<PB N="235" REF="240">
which is called a tragi-comedy, ought to be deno|minated a play, for it con&s;i&s;ts of a plot and an epi|&s;ode that have immediate relation to each other. There are objections to this piece, one of which cannot be got over, becau&s;e it is particularly wrong to call in magic to a&s;&s;i&s;t what ought to be a repre|&s;entation of nature. BATISTA's reading, therefore, in nature's hidden &s;ecrets, and having thereby formed a portrait of SOPHIA which appears to the eyes of MATHIAS beautiful or deformed, according as &s;he is loyal or di&s;loyal, is certainly revolting, and inad|mi&s;&s;ible; but it has this admirable effect: The poet by placing his characters in &s;o forcible a &s;itua|tion, is obliged to give them a language adequate to it, and thus the pa&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y acquires a peculiar kind of turbulence and agitation which, from mere conjectural proofs, could not have be|longed to it.</P>
<P>Of this difficult and delicate ta&s;k, MASSINGER has acquitted him&s;elf wonderfully; &s;o that, if you can bring your&s;elf to pardon the deception, it will encrea&s;e your admiration of the author. Novelty was, probably, his excu&s;e, and he has &s;o availed him&s;elf of it, that, perhaps, there cannot in lan|guage be found any thing &s;tronger than the effect it has produced.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="241">It is impo&s;&s;ible here to go into the different merits of this piece; but whether you take it for conduct, for character, or any other requi&s;ite, but e&s;pecially for language, a few &s;pots excepted, it is certainly a con&s;tellation in literature.</P>
<P><HI>The Emperor of the Ea&s;t</HI> was performed in 1632. This is a tragi-comedy, and taken from the Life of the younger THEODOCIUS. We &s;hould have known more at pre&s;ent, perhaps, of this piece in its original form had not LEE, that mad, but beautiful writer, taken &s;ome of the mo&s;t forcible parts of it for his tragedy of <HI>Theodocius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Maid of Honour,</HI> performed in 1638, is a work of con&s;iderable merit. It has been revived, and particularly within a few years at Drury Lane theatre; but productions by men of &s;uch eminence as MASSINGER &s;hould never be touched but by authors of fir&s;t rate abilities. In its original &s;tate <HI>The Maid of Honour</HI> could not now be produced to advantage, but it had better have remained in its original &s;tate than have appeared as it did at Drury Lane theatre.</P>
<P><HI>The Fatal Dowry,</HI> which was brought out in 1632, is a tragedy, and would probably, have po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="237" REF="242">
more merit if MASSINGER had not been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by FIELD. It has, however, enough to have materially a&s;&s;i&s;ted both ROWE and VOLTAIRE; for it has furni&s;hed the mo&s;t material parts of the <HI>Fair Penitent,</HI> and the character of NERESTAN in <HI>Zara.</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s of this play becau&s;e I like MASSINGER be&s;t when he &s;tands upon his own ground.</P>
<P><HI>A New Way to Pay Old Debts,</HI> is a comedy full of admirable materials. It came out in 1633, and was prefaced by two copies of commendatory ver&s;es, one by &s;ir HENRY MOODY, and the other by &s;ir THOMAS JAY. This play has been con&s;i|dered by mo&s;t of the critics as the be&s;t in all the works of MASSINGER. It is difficult to &s;ay this; but it is certainly drawn with great nature and force, and written with &s;trength and nerve. The over|reaching of &s;ir GILES OVERREACH,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"both a lion and a fox in his proceedings,"</Q>
is ma&s;terly, and the di&s;mi&s;&s;al of his creature MARRALL, is moral and poetic. There are many other parts of this play full of &s;terling merit. It has been &s;everal times re|vived, particularly at Drury Lane, and &s;ince at Covent Garden, to a&s;&s;i&s;t HENDERSON, who per|formed &s;ir GILES OVERREACH with judgment; but injudicious pruning always wounds a good tree,
<PB N="238" REF="243">
and this kind of &s;tab did the reputation of MAS|SINGER &s;u&s;tain in both this ca&s;e and in other ca&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>The Great Duke of Florence.</HI> This piece, like <HI>The Guardian,</HI> is called a comical hi&s;tory. It had great &s;ucce&s;s, and is recommended by ver&s;es written by DONNE and FORD. The &s;tory of EDGAR and ELFRIDA, is &s;aid to have been taken from this play; and certainly the circum&s;tance of SANNASARRO's giving the Count a fal&s;e account of LYDIA's beauty, has a re&s;emblance to that part of it; but that &s;tory was known before MASSINGER, therefore, RYMER, who took his materials from <HI>William of Malme&s;bury,</HI> RAVENSCROFT who profitted of both, and HILL, who&s;e <HI>Athelwold,</HI> and al&s;o MASON's <HI>Elfrida,</HI> were taken from hi&s;tory, could not have had the lea&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity to re&s;ort to the <HI>Duke of Florence</HI> for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>The Unnatural Combat,</HI> performed in 1639, is a tragedy of very great merit. This merit, however, lies more in the a&s;toni&s;hing manner in which the au|thor has treated this &s;trange &s;ubject than in the con|duct of the piece it&s;elf. To fancy revolting circum|&s;tances, which it is dreadful to admit may be natural, and operate upon them as if they were generally &s;o, is begging the que&s;tion, and cannot be excu&s;ed, however forcibly it may &s;peak the merit of that
<PB N="239" REF="244">
author who can write well upon &s;uch extraordinary occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The mutual accu&s;ations of the father and &s;on, which are the cau&s;e of the combat, the artful man|ner in which the Elder MALEFORT impo&s;es upon the Count by acting the BRUTUS, and the delicate, yet determined tone of the Younger, who accu&s;es his father of an ince&s;tuous crime which he &s;carcely dares to hint, is executed with &s;uch &s;ound judg|ment, &s;uch &s;hrewd art, and &s;uch con&s;ummate ad|dre&s;s, that I cannot think there is any thing in lan|guage to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">val it, but, though the&s;e have been con|&s;idered, from AESCHYLUS to us, as the proper &s;ub|jects to excite terror, and &s;o they are in one &s;en&s;e, I never will allow they are the legitimate, fair ob|jects of the drama.</P>
<P>At any rate let there be qualification. The ince&s;t of HAMLET's father, cau&s;ed by ambition, is an ad|mi&s;&s;ible &s;ubject for an author, the ince&s;t of MALE|FORT's father, without a motive but barely wicked|ne&s;s, is not admi&s;&s;ible; and, under the&s;e circum|&s;tances much as the writing of <HI>The Unnatural Com|bat</HI> may captivate, I believe no real well wi&s;her to the intere&s;t of the drama will wi&s;h to &s;ee it brought forward on the &s;tage.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="245"><HI>The Guardian,</HI> performed in 1655, is a comedy of very great merit; and, two or three trifling par|ticulars excepted, I &s;ee nothing to prevent its hold|ing a regular rank on the &s;tage. It is full of well managed equivoque, which is judiciou&s;ly heightened at the end of the third act, and naturally developed at the fini&s;h of the play. The writing is of that fluent and ea&s;y kind that, neverthele&s;s, has &s;trength and force, and that gives to manline&s;s, and greatne&s;s of mind, the unaffected expre&s;&s;ion of nature; but this is the peculiar beauty of MASSINGER; who, let his &s;ubjects be ever &s;o common, never de&s;cends.</P>
<P><HI>The Ba&s;hful Lover,</HI> a tragi-comedy, which was produced at the Private Theatre, at Black Friars, in 1655, de&s;erves mention only on account of many beauties that are &s;cattered up and down in different parts of it; for it is not con&s;tructed with the u&s;ual correctne&s;s of MASSINGER, nor is the drift of the plots &s;o intere&s;ting as any of his other pieces.</P>
<P><HI>The Very Woman,</HI> is another tragi-comedy. It was performed al&s;o in 1655, and has merit; but neither that nor &s;ir ASTON COCKAINE's <HI>Ob&s;tinate Lady,</HI> from which it is borrowed, has a good claim to any material reputation. The more you read MASSINGER the more you admire him, and, there|fore,
<PB N="241" REF="246">
even in this play, we trace a true genius and an elegant writer; but it is, neverthele&s;s, unequal to many of his other productions.</P>
<P><HI>The Old Law,</HI> a comedy brought out in 1656, is by no means a good play, though parts of it are ad|mirable. MASSINGER was here a&s;&s;i&s;ted by MID|DLETON and ROWLEY. Perhaps it would have better if he had been let alone; certainly nei|ther of the&s;e writers was by any means equal to MASSINGER.</P>
<P><HI>The City Madam,</HI> produced in 1659. This co|medy, which has a mo&s;t laudable drift, is worked up with great art and addre&s;s. The folly of the chil|dren of indu&s;try and &s;obriety, who &s;purn at that happine&s;s they legitimately po&s;&s;e&s;s, and that &s;table con&s;equence by which they are the &s;upport of the commercial intere&s;t of the kingdom, and, therefore, the ba&s;is of its wealth, for the tran&s;itory and frivolous plea&s;ures of the court, has been properly con&s;idered by the dramati&s;t as the be&s;t materials for the ex|erci&s;e of his genius.</P>
<P>MASSINGER here has handled this &s;ubject in a ma&s;terly &s;tyle. His portraits are faithful to nature,
<PB N="242" REF="247">
his manners are correctly appropriate, and his di&s;|crimination is nice and critical.</P>
<P>Haughty, puffed up beauty, full of vanity and ambition, is as natural as it is contemptible; grovling ideas and riches wre&s;ted from the un&s;u&s;pecting and nece&s;&s;itous, are in&s;eperable, and a di&s;tinction be|tween folly and crime, weakne&s;s and wickedne&s;s, is, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, the duty of an author. Thus has MASSINGER made his <HI>City Madam</HI> and her daughters arrogant and overbearing to be &s;everely puni&s;hed and afterwards pardoned, and thus he has made that fo&s;tered &s;nake the dependant brother the in&s;trument of temporary puni&s;hment to others who&s;e crimes were within the limits of pardon; till, at la&s;t, his arts recoil upon him&s;elf, and he is confounded in that ruin he had meditated for others.</P>
<P>This is the grand outline of the play, and very fine it is; there are &s;ubordinate particulars, however, which might have been better managed, &s;ir JOHN, LACY, and PLENTY might have been more judi|ciou&s;ly di&s;gui&s;ed and have come with a more pro|bable tale, con&s;idering the con&s;ummate art of the man they had to deal with, and the magic at la&s;t, after the di&s;repute poor STARGAZE had thrown it into, is a poor contrivance to awe a libertine, and an
<PB N="243" REF="248">
unbeliever; and, even if it had been in other re|&s;pects admi&s;&s;ible, it is a blameable vehicle for a dra|matic plot, but particularly for a comedy. We pa&s;s over a gho&s;t in a tragedy, we are even charmed with a &s;pectre in a romance, and we have no ob|jection to changing of the wives in the <HI>Devil to Pay,</HI> becau&s;e it is a farce, though none of the&s;e are cri|tically right, but producing ORPHEUS, CERBERUS, CHARON, and twenty other fanta&s;tic &s;pirits in a &s;ober citizen's hou&s;e would not have impo&s;ed upon LUKE, nor ought it to have impo&s;ed upon the audience.</P>
<P>The faults, however, in this comedy after all are but trivial, and were they judiciou&s;ly removed, and the denouement brought about by a more na|tural means, there are few pieces on the &s;tage that could challenge a fairer claim to reputation.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the play already mentioned, there were others, written by MASSINGER, of which we have different accounts. Of the&s;e <HI>The Noble Choice, The Judge, or Believe as you Li&s;t, The Spani&s;h Viceroy, Minerva's Sacrifice, The Tyrant, Philenzo and Hippolita, Antonio and Vallia,</HI> and <HI>Fa&s;t and Welcome,</HI> were lo&s;t to the world by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of a &s;ervant belonging to Mr. WARBURTON, the SOMERSETSHIRE Herald.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="249">Three others under the titles of <HI>The Wandering Lovers, The Italian Night Piece,</HI> and <HI>The Pri&s;oner,</HI> were performed but never printed. The&s;e, there|fore, that have been here enumerated with a &s;light account of their different merits, may be con&s;idered as the theatre of MASSINGER; and here it is im|po&s;&s;ible to help noticing that I cannot in my con|&s;cience agree to the dates of the&s;e plays which I have &s;et down, by the concurrent authorities of various writers, exactly as I found them.</P>
<P>To &s;et up any criterion of my own, founded only on probable circum&s;tances, as to the dates, would be to combat errors, which, to a mon&s;trous number, are con&s;idered as dramatic go&s;pel. Com|mon &s;en&s;e will not permit us to credit the date of any play between 1635 and the Re&s;toration; for PRYNN and Puritani&s;m &s;o attacked the &s;tage, that, though it lifted its head for a &s;hort time, its own ruin was involved at length in the ruin of the con&s;titution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This PRYNN who was a barri&s;ter of Lincoln's Inn, and an enthu&s;ia&s;tic puritan, publi&s;hed in 1633, a work which he called <HI>Hi&s;trio Ma&s;tix, or Player's Scourge.</HI> This was a mo&s;t ab&s;urd, illi|beral, and wanton abu&s;e of plays, players and all who favoured them. It was an&s;wered judiciou&s;ly enough by a publication of as many old plays as could be &s;ound, the drift of which did not ap|pear to be of that immoral tendency that PRYNN had repre&s;ented; other circum&s;tances concurred al&s;o to render this bigot unpopular. He &s;ays in his book that

This was con&s;idered as a reflection on the king and queen, who publicly frequented plays. He vents his antipathy to mu&s;ic in terms as unqualified, and, in particular, he calls church mu&s;ic <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The bleating of brute bea&s;ts,"</Q> and &s;ays,

The fir&s;t of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages reflecting upon the king and nobles, and the other on the church, it was deemed an infamous libel on every branch of the &s;tate, and ordered to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman: and, in addition to this, his own &s;entence was to be put from the bar, to be excluded the Society of Lincoln's Inn, and degraded by the Univer&s;ity of OXFORD; to &s;tand in the pillory in We&s;tmi&s;ter and Cheap&s;ide, to lo&s;e an ear at each place, and &s;tand w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">th a paper in his hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4+ letters">ing his offence to be a libel again&s;t both their maj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="4 letters">es and the govern|ment, to be fined five thou&s;and pounds, and to &s;uffer perpetual im|pri&s;onment; the whole of which &s;entence was put into execution to the letter.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. CHAPMAN, HEYWOOD, DECKER, MARSTON, AND OTHERS.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now go into all that it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay on the &s;ubject of CHAPMAN and other writers, who, though they were con&s;idered as a &s;ubordinate cla&s;s, were, neverthele&s;s, men of abilities; and, hav|ing done this, and al&s;o noticed what more I may conceive my&s;elf bound to &s;ay of JONSON, I &s;hall pur&s;ue the willing ta&s;k of dwelling a little more on the plays of SHAKESPEAR.</P>
<P>Before JAMES the fir&s;t, CHAPMAN produced two plays. In 1605 he brought out a comedy called <HI>All Fools,</HI> which was taken from TERENCE, and which received con&s;iderable applau&s;e. <HI>Ea&s;t|ward Hoe,</HI> performed in the &s;ame year, is more celebrated for the predicament into which it plunged its &s;uppo&s;ed authors, CHAPMAN, JONSON, and MARSTON, as the reader will recollect, than for any merit the piece it&s;elf contained. HOGARTH,
<PB N="248" REF="253">
however, took from it the plan of his <HI>Idle and In|du&s;trious Apprentices,</HI> and it was revived many years &s;ince as a proper &s;ub&s;titute on Lord Mayor's Day, for that di&s;grace to the &s;tage, <HI>The London Cuckolds,</HI> TATE again brought it forward and called it <HI>The Cuckold's Haven,</HI> and Mrs. LENOX al&s;o brought it out with alterations under the title of <HI>Old City Manners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Gentleman U&s;her,</HI> a comedy produced in 1606, had its parti&s;ans, but it is indifferently &s;poken of, and there is a doubt whether it was ever acted, <HI>Mon&s;ieur D'Olive,</HI> performed in the &s;ame year, re|ceived &s;ome prai&s;e, and we are told was performed with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Bu&s;&s;y D'Ambois</HI> made its appearance in 1607. It was the fir&s;t tragedy produced by CHAPMAN, and thought by &s;ome to be the be&s;t of his works. It kept the &s;tage for a time with con&s;iderable repu|tation, but at length, that eternal mutilater of good authors, DURFEY laid his iron hand on it, from which time it became &s;o crampt that it has ever &s;ince been laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ar and Pompey</HI> was performed in the &s;ame year with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s. The <HI>Con&s;piracy,</HI> and <HI>Tra|gedy of Charles Duke of Byron, Mar&s;hal of France</HI>
<PB N="249" REF="254">
came out in 1608, and con&s;i&s;ts of two plays which relate to the hi&s;tory of FRANCE in the time of HENRY the fourth.</P>
<P><HI>May Day,</HI> a comedy, was brought out at Black Friars in 1613. There is nothing material known of this piece, but <HI>The Widow's Tears,</HI> produced in 1612, is well &s;poken of The &s;ubject is evidently <HI>The Ephe&s;ian Matron,</HI> but in the other parts there are &s;ome well wrought &s;cenes, and &s;everal affecting and intere&s;ting incidents. CHAPMAN is every where a man of learning, but he has in this play &s;hewn him|&s;elf a writer of ta&s;te and genius.</P>
<P><HI>The Revenge of Bu&s;&s;y D'Ambois,</HI> is a bad attempt at following up a good &s;ubject, for it is not &s;o clo&s;e to hi&s;tory as the former play, nor does it create &s;o much intere&s;t. The <HI>Ma&s;que of the Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn.</HI> This was no more than a tem|porary piece to celebrate the marriage of the Count PALATINE, of the RHINE, with the Prince&s;s ELIZABETH. It was performed before the Royal Family at Whitehall, and co&s;t the &s;ocieties of the&s;e courts two thou&s;and four hundred pounds. The machinery and decorations were de&s;igned and con|ducted by INIGO JONES.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="255"><HI>Two Wi&s;e Men and all the re&s;t Fools.</HI> It is doubtful whether this curious piece was written by CHAPMAN; but, as it has never been a&s;cribed to any other author, we always find it in his catalogue. It was performed, or, perhaps, only printed, in 1619, and is remarkable for having a prologue and epilogue in pro&s;e, and for its being extended to &s;even acts; but as the&s;e are inovations of no kind of con|&s;equence, the intelligent reader would have been better &s;atisfied if an account had been pre&s;erved of its merits as to character, incident, and &s;ituation.</P>
<P><HI>Revenge for Honour,</HI> The <HI>Fatal Love,</HI> The <HI>Tra|gedy of a York&s;hire Gentlewoman and her Son,</HI> and The <HI>Second Maiden's Tragedy,</HI> are al&s;o from the pen of CHAPMAN, but they do not appear to have been printed, and, therefore, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay any thing of their merits with certainty. What we do know of this author, who was, as is univer&s;ally admitted, a man of &s;ound erudition, in the character of a dramati&s;t is at lea&s;t honourable to his fame, which cannot, perhaps, receive a &s;tronger proof than his being con&s;idered a re&s;pectable cotemporary writer with SHAKESPEAR, and an object of envy to JONSON.</P>
<P>HEYWOOD's dramatic works, after the death of
<PB N="251" REF="256">
ELIZABETH, next claim our attention. <HI>If you Know not me you Know Nobody,</HI> was performed in 1606. This production con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, and relates to circum&s;tances which happened during the reign of ELIZABETH, but how the building of the Royal Exchange can be dramatized is really more than one can ordinarily conceive. Upon the whole it was a &s;trange incomprehen&s;ible thing, which the author allows, but he &s;hields him&s;elf from cen|&s;ure by a declaration that it was printed without his con&s;ent, and to prove that this copy, which is full of irregularity, and not even divided into acts, might be modified and amended, he produced what he conceived a perfect piece on the &s;ame &s;ubject, which, however, met as bad a fate as the original.</P>
<P><HI>The Fair Maid of the Exchange,</HI> of which men|tion is only made of the title, <HI>The Golden Age,</HI> and <HI>The Silver Age,</HI> two pieces crammed full of cir|cum&s;tances from the Heathen Mythology without order, or coherence, as is al&s;o his next piece called The <HI>Brazen Age,</HI> and <HI>The Four Apprentices of Lon|don,</HI> with the <HI>Conque&s;t of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which is taken from the exploits of GODFREY of BOLLOGNE, a mo&s;t romantic &s;ubject for a play, are al&s;o among HEYWOOD's dramatic productions.</P>
<P>After this we met with <HI>A Woman killed with</HI>
<PB N="252" REF="257">
<HI>Kindne&s;s,</HI> a piece, though upon a mo&s;t extravagant and over&s;trained &s;ubject, certainly written in a &s;trong and ma&s;terly &s;tyle. The incidents are per|plexed, owing to their number, but the relation they bear to one another is perfectly dramatic, ex|cept the quarrel of MONTFORD and ACTON, which had better have been out of the piece. There is &s;omething revolting in the conduct of Mrs. FRANK|FORD, but her contrition, and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her not de&s;erving that lenity which her forgiving hu&s;band, in con&s;equence of her repentence, hu|manely &s;hews her, and which produces the remor&s;e that is the cau&s;e of her death, exhibits a mo&s;t forci|ble moral. It &s;eems to reprobate by anticipation the dangerous doctrines of lord CHESTERFIELD, and is, in fact, whether de&s;ignedly or not, the ground work of Mr. PRATT's admirable pro|duction The <HI>Pupil of Plea&s;ure.</HI> The&s;e are the worthie&s;t purpo&s;es to which the &s;tage can be applied, and if this play were well modernized, and well acted, it could not fail of brilliant &s;ucce&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As I conceive it a duty to lift the Engli&s;h &s;tage, wherever I properly may, into con&s;equence, I &s;hall never omit any material proof that it has been of &s;ervice to foreigners. I have no doubt but DODSLEY's twelve volumes of Old Plays have created half the re|putation of the German theatre. It is a pity, however, that the German authors con&s;tantly pervert the morality of the&s;e plays; for, upon the &s;ooting that their &s;tage is now con&s;tructed, their characters are any thing but natural and moral; which may be proved in many in&s;tances. I &s;hall only, however, adduce one proof, which I do upon fair and liberal ground, conceiving it a po&s;itive duty I owe the public to warn them again&s;t the introduction of fal&s;e ta&s;te. The proof I mean is the <HI>Stranger,</HI> a play recently performed at Drury Lane, which is evidently taken from <HI>A Woman killed with Kindne&s;s,</HI> with this difference, that in the fir&s;t the hu&s;band receives an adultre&s;s to his bed, a thing which an audience ought not to tolerate, and in the other, however the imbecility of nature may plead for the guilty wife, the hu&s;band true to his own honour, nay, to her honour, to the honour of his children, for there are children in both plays, &s;olemnly allots her a &s;ituation worthy of his wife, where &s;he may repent at lei&s;ure, but re&s;olves to have no further intercour&s;e with her, all which &s;he beautifully calls <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"a mild &s;entence."</Q> There, &s;ince nothing but death can obliterate her crime, her remor&s;e and his complicated kindne&s;s put an end to her exi&s;tence; and why has the poet done this? That the wife may be forgiven and pitied, that the hu&s;band's honour may be re&s;tored, and that the children taught by &s;o &s;olemn an example, may walk in the paths of virtue. This is moral, and poetic; but would any of the&s;e ends be attained were the hu&s;band, forgetful of him&s;elf, and of &s;ocial and moral duty, to pardon her frailty, to con&s;ecrate adultery, and to imprint on the young minds of his children that happine&s;s is to be earned by in|famy? The&s;e are facts, and I &s;hall make no further comment on them than to &s;ay, that &s;uch perverted exhibitions are traps for virtue, and that the better they are written the more they will prove &s;eductive.</P>
<P>I cannot re&s;i&s;t tran&s;cribing a &s;hort &s;cene, to &s;hew how exqui&s;itely natural, yet difficult, the conduct of the hu&s;band is.</P>
<P>After &s;he has &s;aid, fearing her hu&s;band's ju&s;t anger, that &s;he de|&s;erves a thou&s;and deaths, but entreats that, for the &s;ake of her &s;ex, to which &s;he was once an ornament, but then a reproach, he would not deform her, nor wound her but let her body go perfect to her grave, he an&s;wers:<Q><SP>

<P><HI>The Iron Age.</HI> The&s;e fanciful kind of pieces are very ill calculated for the &s;tage but, now and then incongruities plea&s;e be&s;t.

<PB N="257" REF="262">
ver&s;es before it, and <HI>Fortune by Sea and Land,</HI> in which ROWLEY a&s;&s;i&s;ted, are all the dra|matic productions we know of, out of the prodi|gious number which HEYWOOD, like HARDY, is &s;aid, and, perhaps with equal truth, to have written.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e pieces few will be found regular, taking them by any denomination. <HI>A Woman killed with Kindne&s;s,</HI> is beyond mea&s;ure the be&s;t production of this author, and yet there is much good writing, and there are many beauties in &s;ome of his other produc|tions; but they were upon &s;uch &s;trange, fanciful &s;ub|jects that they could come into no cla&s;s; and, as to the immen&s;e labour he is &s;aid to have be&s;towed on them, his great merit &s;eems to have been a good memory, for he has &s;o thrown together what he had conned at &s;chool, that, in&s;tead of being original him&s;elf, he was little more than the amanuen&s;is of the ancients.</P>
<P>DECKER, after the death of queen ELIZABETH, produced the following pieces. The <HI>Hone&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> performed in 1604. The different opinions con|cerning this play &s;hew how little we know, with any certainty, of the works of authors at that period. A biographer tells us confidently, that neither this play nor the &s;equel to it is divided into acts; but
<PB N="258" REF="263">
this is &s;o far from the truth that DODSLEY has printed it in his collection of old Plays, where it not only appears in a very regular &s;tate, but gives good proof that DECKER had con&s;iderable merit. The &s;econd part, appears to have been a num|ber of &s;cenes thrown together, but it was never dige&s;ted into a regular play.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;tward Hoe.</HI> This play was brought on in 1607. WEBSTER a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the writing of it, as he did of <HI>Northward Hoe,</HI> and we are told they had both &s;ucce&s;s, probably more owing to the titles caught from the <HI>Ea&s;tward Hoe,</HI> which we have &s;een &s;o popular in con&s;equence of having involved its authors in &s;uch di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whore of Babylon,</HI> written expre&s;sly in compliment to queen ELIZABETH, with a view to expo&s;e the de&s;igns of the Je&s;uits, and &s;et forth their dangerous plots, from which the queen e&s;caped, was printed in 1607, but it is mo&s;t probable it never was performed. The queen is repre&s;ented under the character of TITIANA, which name SPENCER originally gave her, and which was adopted by SHAKESPEAR in his <HI>Mid&s;ummer Night's Dream.</HI> There were other characters of that time per&s;onified, all tending to de&s;cribe and illu&s;trate the virtues of
<PB N="259" REF="264">
ELIZABETH, a proper tribute to her exalted merit, and a laudable mode of &s;timulating the loyalty of the people.</P>
<P><HI>If it be not good the Devil's in it.</HI> This play is founded on MACHIAVAL's Marriage of BELPHE|GOR, and is a poor attempt at wit from the title to the la&s;t word. The title, indeed, is &s;o contemptible a quibble that as the Devil is actually in the play, &s;o the author gives it under his hand that it is not good; this flimzy &s;tuff has, however, been fre|quently copied, and once mo&s;t mi&s;erably under the title of a <HI>Comic Opera,</HI> at Drury Lane.</P>
<P><HI>Match me in London.</HI> To this play the different writers have given different merits; but, as it is im|po&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould be excellent, poor, tolerable, and good, at the &s;ame time, which words I copy, we may fairly take it that it had merit and defects.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all the dramatic works the world gives to DECKER. He is &s;aid, however, to have written, in conjunction with DAY, The <HI>Jew of Venice,</HI> not printed, <HI>Guy, Earl of Warwick,</HI> of which various writers have conjectured a good deal but have known nothing, <HI>Gu&s;tavus, King of Swithland,</HI> of which the world is nearly as ignorant, and the <HI>Tale</HI>
<PB N="260" REF="265">
<HI>of Jocondo and A&s;tolpho,</HI> taken probably from the &s;ame &s;tock as LA FONTAINE's <HI>Joconde,</HI> a circum|&s;tance not, however, to be a&s;certained, this play hav|ing been de&s;troyed, together with &s;o many others, by WARBURTON's &s;ervant.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, DECKER cannot be ranked with CHAPMAN and HEYWOOD, and it is very probable that he would not have been half &s;o well re&s;pected as he was, had not the envy of JONSON, who had he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an atom of good &s;en&s;e would have &s;miled and pa&s;&s;ed by him, li&s;ted him into a con&s;equence, not only fancied by him but credited by the world.</P>
<P>MARSTON, who wrote in all but eight plays, produced &s;ix of them after the death of ELIZA|BETH. The <HI>In&s;atiate Counte&s;s,</HI> performed in 1604, is one of them, and contains under feigned titles the hi&s;tory of JOAN, the fir&s;t queen of JERUSALEM, NAPLES, and SICILY, who&s;e &s;tory had been pretty well handled before, both for the &s;tage and as a novel. The reader will remember that BEREN|GER de PARASOLS was poi&s;oned for making free with this lady's character, and this queen is intended by ANNE, duche&s;s of ULME, in GOD's revenge again&s;t adultery. Very little is known as to the real merit of this play.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="266">The <HI>Malcontent,</HI> produced in 1604. This is the play which MARSTON, as we have &s;een, dedicated with &s;uch warmth to JONSON, with whom he had afterwards &s;o &s;evere a quarrel. Some of MARSTON's enemies endeavoured to induce a general belief that this piece was intended as a &s;atire on particular characters, which invidious report JONSON is &s;up|po&s;ed &s;ecretly to have &s;econded, and the probability is that this gave ri&s;e to the di&s;pute which made the breach between the&s;e authors. There does not ap|pear, however, the &s;malle&s;t ground for this impu|tation; for by &s;everal writers, but particularly LANGBAINE, we are a&s;&s;ured the <HI>Malcontent</HI> was a fair, manly, general &s;atire; be&s;ides, we are capable of a&s;certaining this our&s;elves, and &s;o far we mu&s;t vouch in favour of the author, who&s;e piece cer|tainly goes to the times both then and now; but this does not preclude the po&s;&s;ibility that particular per&s;ons &s;at for their portraits, for &s;atire was cer|tainly the vein of MARSTON, and it is impo&s;&s;ible to be critically &s;atirical without fitting the cap &s;omewhere.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch Curtizan.</HI> This comedy is full of the intrigue of tho&s;e times, and mu&s;t certainly have had &s;ucce&s;s, for The <HI>Revenge; or, a Match in New|gate,</HI> which is attributed to BETTERTON, and which
<PB N="262" REF="267">

<P><HI>Pari&s;ita&s;ter; or the Fawn,</HI> performed in 1606, is taken partly from The <HI>Decameron</HI> of BOCCACE, and partly from <HI>Ovid.</HI> It has particular merit, but is not &s;o good a play as any other of the productions of MARSTON.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wonder of Women; or, Sophoni&s;ba,</HI> pro|duced in 1606. This play is rather imitated than copied from hi&s;tory, for the author him&s;elf &s;ays that he has not laboured in it to tye him&s;elf to relate every thing as a hi&s;torian, but to enlarge every thing as a poet.</P>
<P><HI>What you Will,</HI> a comedy, was brought out in 1607. This piece, which did but little it&s;elf, has provided materials for other dramatic productions &s;ince. It appears to be taken from PLAUTUS, but the equivoque of mi&s;taking one per&s;on for another cannot properly be &s;aid to belong to any particular author; it has been u&s;ed in all times, and by all
<PB N="263" REF="268">
writers; and &s;o the circum&s;tances vary it may be con&s;idered always as a novelty.</P>
<P>MARSTON having con&s;ulted regularity and cor|rectne&s;s in the conduct of his plays, and be&s;ides having written them naturally, and both with hu|mour and pathos, mu&s;t rank before DECKER, and e&s;&s;entially, upon a par with CHAPMAN and HEY|WOOD, e&s;pecially when we are told that his poems rendered him &s;till more celebrated than his plays. Being, however, a &s;evere &s;atiri&s;t, his cotemporaries were not willing to allow him his due portion of prai&s;e, and po&s;terity cannot properly judge of his whole merit. What we know of him, however, ranks him very re&s;pectfully as a writer.</P>
<P>MARLOE, in the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t, wrote The <HI>Ma&s;&s;acre of Paris,</HI> a &s;ubject which has em|ployed the pens of &s;o many able writers. LEE wrought it into a play; but, without &s;ome intere&s;t|ing private &s;tory, the &s;ubject is too &s;hocking for an audience. MERCIER in his <HI>Bi&s;hop of Li&s;ieux</HI> has hit upon exactly the method to give it effect. He &s;uppo&s;es a Prote&s;tant family protected by a Catholic bi&s;hop, who ri&s;ks his &s;ituation and his life for their &s;uccour; in con&s;equence of which the &s;oldiery re|volt from their inexorable duty, and the ravages of
<PB N="264" REF="269">
CHARLES the ninth and his pro&s;tigate court are put a &s;top to. Neither MARLOE nor LEE did any thing like this, and, therefore, this play is little known.</P>
<P>The tragical hi&s;tory of <HI>Dr. Fau&s;tus</HI> is &s;poken of in &s;uch vague terms, that, though it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay there was &s;uch a play, it is u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ay more. The <HI>Jew of Malta</HI> was u&s;hered into the world by HEYWOOD, and is &s;aid to have been greatly re|ceived. <HI>Lu&s;t's Dominion</HI> was well received at fir&s;t, and was afterwards altered by Mrs. BEHN, a cir|cum&s;tance all in the lady's way. We &s;hall examine it hereafter under the title of <HI>Abdelazar; or, the Moor's Revenge.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e, with <HI>Dido,</HI> and The <HI>Shepherd's Holiday,</HI> in the fir&s;t of which he joined NASH, and in the other DAY, are all we know of MARLOE. It is very probable he wrote more, and that he could have written better; but, with a mind divided by pro&s;tigacy and debauchery, from that nece&s;&s;ary &s;tudy and nece&s;&s;ary rectitude, by the bye, for the meritorious ta&s;k of inculcating morality, indi&s;pen|&s;ible in a dramatic writer, it is wonderful we have &s;o much to prai&s;e in his public character from which
<PB N="265" REF="270">
his private conduct obliges us &s;o largely to deduct.</P>
<P>MIDDLETON, who produced one play in the reign of ELIZABETH, wrote &s;ixteen dramatic pro|ductions afterwards, and in &s;ix more he was con|cerned with JONSON, FLETCHER, ROWLEY, and others.</P>

<P><HI>A Mad World my Ma&s;ters</HI> performed in 1608, was al&s;o a popular play.

Mrs. BEHN, however, had no objection to this rich vein of humour, and has borrowed &s;ome of the mo&s;t lu&s;cious parts of it for her <HI>City Heire&s;s,</HI> and CHARLES JOHNSON, who, however, was contented with that part which was le&s;s offen&s;ive, availed him&s;elf of a part of the plot for his <HI>Country La&s;&s;es.</HI> Other authors have al&s;o gone to this &s;ource for materials.</P>

But the &s;pirit of this will be ea&s;ily given me when we con&s;ider MIDDLETON as a cotemporary of SHAKESPEAR and not of DRY|DEN. In this particular in&s;tance LANGBAINE bears me out, who thinks all MIDDLETON's plays were performed before the civil wars&mdash;and &s;o no doubt were MASSINGER's&mdash;particularly <HI>Any thing for a quiet Life,</HI> and the rea&s;on he gives for this opinion is that it was publi&s;hed, as well as the <HI>Phooenix,</HI> the <HI>Game of Che&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Family of Love,</HI> by KIRK|MAN, who knew &s;o much of the plays performed at that time and was &s;o careful to attribute each to its proper owner.</P>
<P>The pieces in which MIDDLETON was joined by other writers are The <HI>Roaring Girl,</HI> The <HI>Fair Quarrel,</HI> The <HI>Widow,</HI> The <HI>Changling,</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h Gip&s;ey,</HI> and The <HI>Old Law;</HI> all which, except the <HI>Changling,</HI> which we are told met with con&s;iderable applau&s;e, are very little &s;poken of by the various writers on the drama.</P>

<P>IT will yet be nece&s;&s;ary to mention a third cla&s;s of dramatic poets; which, though inferior to tho&s;e noticed already, were con&s;idered as men of talents.</P>
<P>WEBSTER, who frequently wrote in conjunction with DECKER, MARSTON, and ROWLEY, ventured now and then to go alone. There are &s;ix plays pub|li&s;hed with his name to them, under the titles of The <HI>White Devil,</HI> The <HI>Devil's Law Ca&s;e,</HI> The <HI>Duche&s;s of Malfy, Appius and Virginia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a play called <HI>Appius and Virginia,</HI> entered in the books of the Stationer's Company, by RICHARD JONNES, in 1577, the title page of which de&s;cribes the conduct of VIRGINIA,

<P><PB N="272" REF="277">The fir&s;t of the&s;e plays we have no particular account of, the &s;econd which is partly borrowed from the &s;tory of PHAEREUS JASON, in <HI>Velerius Maximus,</HI> and partly from the <HI>Hi&s;toires admirable of</HI> GAULART, met with applau&s;e; the third, taken from LOPEZ de VEGA, GOULART, and BONDELLO, had al&s;o &s;ucce&s;s; the fourth was revived and altered by BETTERTON, and the fifth, and &s;ixth, in which &s;ome &s;ay ROWLEY had a hand, were both received with applau&s;e. WEBSTER, however, does not appear at any time to &s;o much advantage as in tho&s;e pieces wherein he laboured with others, his be&s;t knack be|ing more to find out materials for his a&s;&s;ociates than to give form to them, for he was a pari&s;h clerk, and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant at a &s;chool, neither of which occupations &s;eems very much calculated to give his genius &s;cope, whatever talents he might po&s;&s;e&s;s,</P>
<P>ROWLEY was an actor as well as an author. He was very much e&s;teemed, and, in his man|ners, and being intimately acquainted with all the wits of his time, and carre&s;&s;ed by per&s;ons of the fir&s;t fa&s;hion, he a good deal re&s;embled the French actor RAISIN, of whom I have already &s;poken, and to whom, for his wit, for his elegance, and for his gen|tlemanly qualities, I could find a fini&s;hed likene&s;s in an actor now living who&s;e abilities would honour
<PB N="273" REF="278">
any merit, and who&s;e intimacy would throw a lu&s;tre upon any rank.</P>
<P>It is very probable that the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ROWLEY were of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice to the in|ferior authors of that day; his part of their con|junctive ta&s;k being of cour&s;e to fit the work to the &s;tage, of which department he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have had a better judgment than them.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e plays in which he was connected with others have been mentioned already. There are, however, &s;ix, which he is &s;aid to have written with|out a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Their titles are, <HI>New Wonder; or, a Woman never Vexed, All's Lo&s;t by Lu&s;t, A Match at Midnight, A Shoemaker is a Gentleman,</HI> The <HI>Birth of Merlin,</HI> and the <HI>Witch of Edmonton.</HI></P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the&s;e plays there are diverting cir|cum&s;tances. They are generally taken from old Novels, which he &s;eems to have been well able to dramatize. DODSLEY has printed the <HI>Match at Mid|night</HI> in his old Plays, which is full of very plea&s;ant intrigue, and, in the <HI>Birth of Merlin,</HI> SHAKESPEAR is &s;aid to have lent ROWLEY a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which, though the opinion is not ill &s;upported, &s;eems very
<PB N="274" REF="279">
unlikely. The &s;u&s;picion, however, is greatly ho|nourable to ROWLEY, if it was begotten by a peru&s;al of his writings, but even then it depends upon who were the judges, for till the world at large give their never failing deci&s;ion upon occa&s;ions of &s;uch nice di&s;crimination, the cono&s;cente are too often mi&s;erably gulled out of their rea&s;on by their own con&s;ent; a lamentable truth, of which we have had recent proof.</P>
<P>DAY, who appears to have been well educated, had a hand in &s;ome of the plays produced early in the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t, with DECKER, ROW|LEY, and others, particularly The <HI>Travels of three Engli&s;h Brothers, Guy Earl of Warwick,</HI> and The <HI>Maiden's Holiday.</HI> He al&s;o wrote, una&s;i&s;ted, The <HI>I&s;le of Gulls,</HI> which is taken from &s;ir PHILIP SIDNEY's <HI>Arcadia,</HI> and had &s;ucce&s;s; <HI>Humour out of Breath,</HI> of which we know nothing but the title; <HI>Law Tricks,</HI> which one author calls an admirable play, though no other appears able to give any account of it; The <HI>Parliament of Bees,</HI> which was nothing more than conver&s;ations between twelve per&s;onages, &s;omething in the &s;tyle of the Moralities; and the <HI>Blind Beggar of Bethnel Green,</HI> from which DODS|LEY took the materials for his ballad farce under the &s;ame title.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="280">Lord STIRLING ro&s;e by his merit, from ob|&s;curity to a coronet. During the minority of JAMES the &s;ixth of SCOTLAND, he improved by a polite and elegant education, tho&s;e brilliant parts he inherited from nature. He obtained the patronage of the earl of ARGYLE, who&s;e favour he won in quality of tutor while they were abroad, and, this introducing him to court, he was carre&s;&s;ed, admired, and con&s;ulted by the fir&s;t ranks; till, by able con|duct, great merit, and a &s;eries of fortunate circum|&s;tances, he was made Secretary of State, created afterwards a vi&s;count, and at length an earl. His dramatic works are <HI>Darius, Crae&s;us,</HI> The <HI>Alex|andrian Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e tragedies was a mere juvenile effort and can never be con&s;idered in a perfect light, as it was full of Scotti&s;ms, and by no means calculated for the &s;tage. The &s;econd has a much better claim to attention, but it is wholly borrowed from <HI>Herodotus</HI>; and, indeed, all the works of this author are an imitation of the ancients, and parti|cularly of the phlegmatic SENECA. The third, in which the gho&s;t of ALEXANDER is the principal part, and which is founded upon the differences that aro&s;e among the chiefs of ALEXANDER as to who was to &s;ucceed him, is &s;till more extravagant.
<PB N="276" REF="281">
When he bequeathed his crown
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to the mo&s;t worthy,"</Q>
perhaps he had it in view to perplex the world as much after his death as he had done while living. He &s;ucceeded at any rate with this author, for the &s;ubject is &s;o complicate for a play, that with a great deal of good writing, aed much cla&s;&s;ical knowledge, it was not in his power to bring the council of MELEAGER and PERDICIAS to any rational conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The fourth piece, <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> is a &s;ubject &s;o familiar to every reader, that it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more than that lord STIRLING has &s;hewn in it a competent knowledge of the Roman Hi&s;tory, and commented on that part of it with &s;ound judgment; but this play is not more regular nor better con|&s;tructed than any one of the others, and indeed the author &s;eems not to have gone &s;o much for perfect dramatic pieces, as for mere erudite productions, for he calls them very emphatically four monarchic tragedies, and, his bringing in the chorus between the acts, and dre&s;&s;ing up the matter in all the heavy and turgid pomp of SENECA, &s;hews that it was his ambition more to be admired in the clo&s;et than on the &s;tage.</P>
<P>Sir FULK GREVILLE, lord BROOK, who&s;e life
<PB N="277" REF="282">
may be read at large in FULLER's <HI>Briti&s;h Worthies,</HI> who was born the &s;ame year with &s;ir PHILIP SID|NEY, who was a great favourite of queen ELIZA|BETH, by whom he was created a lord, and who was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his learning and his courage, has a claim to notice here in con&s;equence of his having written two tragedies called <HI>Alaham,</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;tapha.</HI> They were, however, never acted, being upon the model of tho&s;e of lord STIRLING, full of decla|mation, and explained by choru&s;es. Lord BROOK, however, if he was not witty him&s;elf was the cau&s;e of wit in others; for, like his friend, he was a mo&s;t liberal patron and benefactor to the dra|matic writers.</P>
<P>This amiable and celebrated character was mur|dered at the age of &s;eventy-four by one of his de|pendants named HAYWOOD; who, not thinking his &s;ervices &s;ufficiently requited, mortally &s;tabbed his ma&s;ter, and afterwards, to avoid an ignominious death, de&s;troyed him&s;elf. This was in Brook Hou&s;e, Holborn, where Brook Street now &s;tands. On his monument in WARWICK Church, lord BROOK is &s;tyled &s;ervant to queen ELIZABETH, coun&s;ellor to king JAMES, and friend to &s;ir PHILIP SIDNEY.</P>
<P>FIELD, of whom a good deal is conjectured,
<PB N="278" REF="283">
becau&s;e but little is known, wrote two plays, called <HI>Women is a Weathercock,</HI> and <HI>Amends for the Ladies.</HI> The&s;e plays LANGBAINE tells us will &s;till bear reading. I rather think, however, it mu&s;t be by tho&s;e who are endowed with patience. They have neverthele&s;s good materials but are full of &s;trange irregularities.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is dedicated to any woman who is not a weathercock, by which the author means quaintly to in&s;inuate that it is dedicated to nobody. It is warmly commended by CHAPMAN. The &s;econd is an apology, or, as the author calls it, an amends to the fair &s;ex, for having written a &s;atyr again&s;t them in his fir&s;t play. It is imitated from the <HI>Curious Imper|tinent</HI> in DON QUIXOTE, which has been &s;ince treated on the French &s;tage both by BROSSE and DESTOUCHES, and is al&s;o the &s;ubject of The <HI>City Night Cap,</HI> The <HI>Amorous Prince,</HI> and The <HI>Curious Hu&s;band.</HI></P>
<P>It is not &s;ettled whether FIELD the author, and FIELD the actor were the &s;ame per&s;on. We hear of a letter written by ROBERTS, the actor, to POPE, wherein he a&s;&s;erts that the FIELD in que&s;tion was the &s;ame who&s;e name is always joined with HEM|MINGS, BURBAGE, and CONDEL, and the re&s;t of that
<PB N="279" REF="284">
company, placed before the folio edition of SHAKES|PEAR's works, and al&s;o in the dramatis per&s;onae pre|fixed to the <HI>Cynthia's Revels</HI> of JONSON, but &s;ay tho&s;e who quote this authority,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"it is more probable that the FIELD, who was a fellow of New College, OXFORD, was the author."</Q>
This, however, does not, with me, clear up the point at all; a good edu|cation being no more an impediment to good acting than to good writing.</P>
<P>FORD was one of the a&s;&s;ociates of ROWLEY and the re&s;t. He al&s;o wrote eleven plays without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, one of which, '<HI>Tis a pity She's a Whore,</HI> DODSLEY has printed in his collection of old Plays, and which, of cour&s;e, is the be&s;t, as no man knew how to &s;elect with more judgment. He has, how|ever, cho&s;en it, no doubt, for the writing, which is in many parts, &s;trong and poetical, for nothing can be more revolting than the &s;ubject; and, therefore, the warmer and more glowing the pictures of love are worked up, the more reprehen&s;ible is the au|thor, becau&s;e the deeper is the wound given to ho|nour, and to decorum.</P>
<P><Q REND="inline">"But,"</Q> &s;ay the critics,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the title bears out the the author, and the cata&s;trophe is &s;o &s;hocking that that all tho&s;e who may be inclined to practi&s;e

Nothing can be more fal&s;e than &s;uch argument. No warning, no cata&s;trophe can deter &s;uch wretches as are here de&s;cribed; and, as to the title, Is ANNA|BELLA merely a &s;trumpet? No; &s;he is the &s;trumpet of her brother. And is &s;he to be pitied for that? Such rea&s;oning is equally mon&s;trous, ridiculous, and &s;upererogate, and of cour&s;e reprehen&s;ible; for it is not the province of a dramatic writer to &s;eek for mon|&s;ters, and to record prodigies; is it his duty to repro|bate &s;uch vices as are commonly known, and often practi&s;ed, in which catalogue, for the honour of human nature, ince&s;t without a motive has no place; but if it had, it ought to be introduced as a deed of darkne&s;s which could not be pleaded for or ar|gued on, even by the wretches them&s;elves, therefore, all we can &s;ay in favour of FORD is, to wi&s;h be had employed his beautiful writing to a more laudable purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lover's Melancholy.</HI> This was a tragi co|medy, and we find it highly commended by ver&s;es from different friends. The mo&s;t remarkable cir|cum&s;tance concerning it, however, was its &s;ucce&s;s, and its con&s;equence. It came out in the &s;ame week that JONSON produced his <HI>New Inn,</HI> and was re|ceived warmly, while the other was damned, both
<PB N="281" REF="286">
owing in great mea&s;ure to the enemies that JONSON had conjured up, as we &s;hall &s;ee by and by more particularly. This cynical, pedantic churl, who could not bear &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s in a young author, for it was FORD's fir&s;t play, among other ridiculous conduct, charged him with having &s;tolen his ma|terials from SHAKESPEAR's papers, with the con|nivance of HEMMINGS and CONDEL; and this, together with other forene&s;&s;es, brought about JON|SON's ears a thou&s;and &s;quibs, one of which was called, <HI>Old Ben's light heart made heavy by young John's Melancholy Lover.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Love's Sacrifice,</HI> The <HI>Broken Heart, Perkin Warbeck,</HI> The <HI>Fancies Cha&s;te and Noble,</HI> and The <HI>Ladies Tryal,</HI> are &s;poken of as having had &s;ucce&s;s. They were well patronized, and highly commended by different poets, who were, perhaps, as happy to &s;ee the envious JONSON nettled, as the mode&s;t un|a&s;&s;uming FORD carre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Beauty in a Trance,</HI> The <HI>Royal Combat, An ill beginning has a good End,</HI> and The <HI>London Merchant,</HI> are al&s;o &s;aid to have &s;ucceeded; but they are lo&s;t to the world through the &s;ame carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of Mr. WARBURTON's &s;er|vant, by which we were deprived of &s;o many of MASSENGER's plays.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="287">DANIEL, had his dramatic writings being equal to his hi&s;toric, would have claimed a forwarder place in this work. He was born two years before SHAKESPEAR, and embelli&s;hed the reign of ELI|ZABETH, as we have &s;een by giving to hi&s;tory a poli&s;h which till then was unknown to it. The ac|counts concerning him are very contradictory, &s;ome averring that he only lived fifty-&s;even years, and others eighty. The&s;e are points, however, which I always &s;teer clear of inve&s;tigating, fearing to imitate tho&s;e who are anxious to tell their readers how long an author lived, rather than to &s;hew whether he lived to any good purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The dramatic pieces of DANIEL are &s;ix in num|ber; among which, <HI>Cleopatra</HI> was e&s;teemed a well written production, but not well calculated for re|pre&s;entation; The <HI>Queen's Arcadia,</HI> a compliment to queen ANNE, con&s;ort of JAMES the fir&s;t, is &s;aid to have been borrowed from QUINAULT's <HI>Comedie Sans Comedies,</HI> and RANDOLPH's <HI>Amyntas,</HI> which is &s;o far from the truth, that at the time this play came out, RANDOLPH was in his cradle, and QUINAULT was not born till nearly &s;eventy years afterwards. <HI>Tethy's Fe&s;tival</HI> was a thing merely writ|ten in honour of the unfortunate CHARLES, when he was created Prince of Wales, <HI>Hymen's Triumph</HI> was
<PB N="283" REF="288">
al&s;o an occa&s;ional thing on the nuptials of lord ROXBOROUGH, and The <HI>Vi&s;ion of the Twelve God|de&s;&s;es</HI> was again complimentary, DANIEL having written it as an allegorical repre&s;entation of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace enjoyed under JAMES the fir&s;t. So that it is plain he wrote his dramatic pieces in quality of poet laureat, and that he worked hard for his But of Sack.</P>
<P>This, indeed, is the wor&s;t trait in the character of DANIEL, for the &s;ubjects of his productions were little worthy the ver&s;es be&s;towed upon them, and indeed, were we to take all we know of hi&s;tory, we &s;hould find upon a compari&s;on that the wor&s;t vices of bad men have been often glo&s;&s;ed over by good poets, while the be&s;t virtues of good men have pa&s;&s;ed unrecorded; and the rea&s;on is evident. Vice needs the able&s;t talents to defend it; virtue is its own advocate; and thus it is only that, by a col|lective review of various exertions, characters are accorded legitimate fame.</P>
<P>The other play of DANIEL, called <HI>Philotas,</HI> is &s;aid to have very nearly jo&s;tled him out of his &s;eat as poet laureat on account of a report, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been connived at by JONSON who &s;ucceeded to that honourable po&s;t after him. This report was that DANIEL, in the character of PHILOTAS, had
<PB N="284" REF="289">
brought forward the unfortunate earl of ESSEX, a &s;ubject certainly of too tender a nature to touch on at that time, and the con&s;equences became &s;o &s;erious that he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of vindi|cating him&s;elf in an apology printed at the end of the play.</P>
<P>The fact of this report having been propagated there can be no doubt of, but the ground on which it is &s;uppo&s;ed that JONSON connived at it is not firm, for it is pre&s;umed upon under an idea that the play made its fir&s;t appearance in 1606, which is the period ad|mitted by every writer that I have looked into; but it has not the lea&s;t probability to &s;upport it. I have no doubt the mi&s;take has ari&s;en from a &s;uppo|&s;ition that DANIEL was only laureat to JAMES the fir&s;t, whereas he &s;ucceeded to that &s;ituation at the death of SPENCER, four years before the death of ELIZABETH, during which time no doubt he brought out this play. Hence the predicament into which his enemies attempted to plunge him, and this &s;peaks for it&s;elf; for what did JAMES care about the earl of ESSEX?</P>
<P>I do not, however, mean to &s;ay that this excul|pates JONSON, who&s;e envy was no doubt as tingling in the reign of ELIZABETH as in the reign of JAMES, and the hateful bent of who&s;e private cha|racter
<PB N="285" REF="290">
needs not this trait to magnify its deformity. My intention is only to give an added proof how little dates are to be relied upon, and to rectify fal&s;e <HI>ip&s;e dixits</HI> by detecting them through circum|&s;tances. The fact upon this principle as to DAN|IEL's plays is, that <HI>Philotas,</HI> which is allowed on all hands to be his fir&s;t, he wrote in the reign of ELI|ZABETH; and, having had a ta&s;te of that danger he was likely to run among his enemies at court, he deferred his other dramatic writings till the next reign; when, in order to keep on the &s;afe &s;ide of the po&s;t, he went into the other extreme and quitted &s;atire for adulation.</P>
<P>BREWER has been con&s;idered by all authors as a dramatic writer, and by many as a man of talents nearly equal to SHAKESPEAR, and yet &s;ome of them give him credit but for two plays of which they &s;u&s;pect one was written by &s;omebody el&s;e. From &s;uch materials as the&s;e are writers obliged to collect hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>As the particulars of this di&s;pute are a little extra|ordinary I &s;hall go into them in &s;ome degree by way of a le&s;&s;on to credulous readers. BREWER is &s;aid, by tho&s;e who are willing to allow him, perhaps, more than the full extent of his merit, to have written &s;ix
<PB N="286" REF="291">
plays under the titles of <HI>Landgartha, Love's Do|minion, Love's Load&s;tone, Lingua,</HI> The <HI>Country Girl,</HI> and The <HI>Love Sick King,</HI> and tho&s;e who accord him this portion of fame. if it be any, among whom are WINSTANLEY, and PHILLIPS, &s;ay al&s;o that he was a man of mo&s;t extraordinary genius, which is recorded in a poem, called <HI>Steps to Parna&s;&s;us,</HI> where he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have the magic power of calling in the Mu&s;es to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; thus be|coming to SHAKESPEAR that &s;ort of rival that HESIOD is &s;aid to have been to HOMER.</P>
<P>LANGBAINE, JACOB, GILDON, and others, however, allow him to have been author of only the la&s;t two, and LANGBAINE &s;u&s;pects one of the&s;e not to have belonged to him becau&s;e it was pub|li&s;hed with the initials T. B. whereas had it been BREWER's, it mu&s;t have been A. B. which con|jecture certainly has probability enough to &s;up|port it.</P>
<P>The re&s;t, who have been at &s;ome pains to a&s;cer|tain the truth in this bu&s;ine&s;s, congratulate them|&s;elves upon having DODSLEY's po&s;itive authority that, in addition to the&s;e two plays, BREWER wrote <HI>Lingua.</HI> Now this happens not to be the truth, for DODSLEY gives no po&s;itive opinion on the
<PB N="287" REF="292">
&s;ubject, but &s;ays merely that WINSTANLEY has given this play to BREWER, but that LANGBAINE will not allow it to belong to him, which is all perfecly right in DODSLEY, his bu&s;ine&s;s being to collect old plays belong to whom they might. He, therefore, pledges him&s;elf to none of the&s;e opinions; but, on the contrary, &s;ays that CROM|WELL, having performed at CAMBRIDGE the part of TACTUS in the play, which is a contention among the &s;en&s;es for a crown, it has been fooli&s;hly &s;aid, by WINSTANLEY, LANGBAINE, and the re&s;t, to have in&s;pired him with ambition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As this anecdote is rather curious, and has found its way into mo&s;t of the accounts of this author, improbable as it is, it may not be ami&s;s to notice that the part of TACTUS, or TOUCH, which was allotted to CROMWELL, has in it this extraordinary &s;peech:
<Q><SP>
<L>Ro&s;es, and bays, pack hence! this crown and robes,</L>
<L>My brows, and body, circles and inve&s;ts:</L>
<L>How gallantly it fits me!&mdash;&s;ure the &s;lave</L>
<L>Mea&s;ured my head that wrought this coronet.&mdash;</L>
<L>They lie that &s;ay, complexions cannot change!</L>
<L>My blood's enobled, and I am transform'd</L>
<L>Unto the &s;acred temper of a king.</L>
<L>Methinks I hear my noble para&s;ites</L>
<L>Stiling me CAESAR, or great ALEXANDER,</L>
<L>Licking my feet, &amp;c.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>This he is &s;aid to have &s;poken and felt with &s;uch force and energy that it bred in him the fir&s;t ideas of that &s;anguinary ambition which began with blood, was &s;upported by terror, and which, at length, calmed into melioration.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="293">To &s;hew the reader, however, how far this au|thor merits &s;o much contention, and to what a de|gree he was &s;o dangerous a rival to SHAKESPEAR, <HI>Lingua,</HI> though it has &s;ome good writing, is little better than one of the Moralties; The <HI>Country Girl</HI> is not known enough for any author to give a de&s;cription of it, and The <HI>Love Sick King</HI> was only pre&s;erved to be altered into a very poor piece, called The <HI>Perjured Nun</HI>; and as to the other three plays, the very &s;ame authors, who in&s;i&s;t they were written by BREWER, give <HI>Landgartha</HI> to BURRELL, <HI>Love's Dominion</HI> to FLECKNOE, and as to <HI>Love's Load&s;tone</HI> it has &s;o lo&s;t its attraction, if it ever had any, they have not been able to find it at all: &s;o completely have they de&s;erted the &s;ame of their their favourite and their own con&s;i&s;tency; which, that it may be all of a piece, has been &s;o correct that they do not even know when BREWER wrote, for they make OLIVER CROMWELL act originally in <HI>Lingua,</HI> who mu&s;t have been but eight years old when that play, if it may be called &s;o, was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e authors I have, perhaps, given a more particular account than their merits or my limits warranted. I had a mind, however, to notice as much of their celebrity as would &s;erve to &s;trengthen the reputation which the &s;tage held in this early yet
<PB N="289" REF="294">
remarkable era; but there were many other dra|matic writers &s;ome of whom I &s;hall &s;lightly mention.</P>
<P>BARNES, who was the &s;on of a bi&s;hop, and &s;erved in the army under the celebrated and un|fortunate earl of ESSEX, wrote a play called The <HI>Devils's Charter,</HI> in which he has endeavoured to hand down to execration that mo&s;t contemptible of all characters Pope ALEXANDER the &s;ixth. He has framed his play upon the model of PERICLES, Prince of TYRE, for having taken his &s;tory from GUICCIARDINI, he makes him his interlocutor ex|actly as the other author conjures up GOWER, the old Engli&s;h bard, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>TO BASKER, of whom we have little certain in|telligence, is attributed a play called The <HI>Bloody Banquet,</HI> but with very little propriety perhaps, be|cau&s;e the initials J. D. are prefixed to it. BEL|CHIER DRAWBRIDGECOURT wrote or tran&s;lated a &s;trange thing called <HI>Hans Beer Pot's invi&s;ible Co|medy</HI>; &s;o uncertain, however, is all the intelligence we procure concerning &s;uch authors, particularly as they get more in&s;ignificant, that this piece has been a&s;cribed to NASH.</P>
<P>BROWNE, who&s;e works were collected and
<PB N="290" REF="295">
publi&s;hed &s;omething more than twenty years ago, wrote, in 1623, a dramatic piece called The <HI>Inner Temple Ma&s;que.</HI> CAMPION, a phy&s;ician in the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t, was author of two compli|mentary pieces in the &s;tyle of tho&s;e written by DANIEL. COOK wrote a comedy which DODS|LEY has thought it worth his while to publi&s;h in his old Plays. It was called <HI>Green's Tu Quoque,</HI> and written in compliment to an actor who had a me|thod of jeering, or as it is called at this day, of quizzing, his friends, by uttering comically tho&s;e words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HEYWOOD, in his preface to the play, gives this actor the following character.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"There was not an actor of his nature in his time, of better ability in his performance of what he undertook, more applauded by the audience, of better grace at court, or of more general love in the city."</Q>
On the back of the title is this di&s;tich, which &s;hews that the actor, as well as the author, was then dead.
<Q><L>How fa&s;t bleak Autumn changeth FLORA's dye!</L>
<L>What ye&s;terday was GREEN, now's fear and dry.</L></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>TAILOR wrote The <HI>Hog hath lo&s;t his Pearl,</HI> a &s;trange comedy, that DODSLEY has, however, to give an idea of the contra&s;t between different early writers, publi&s;hed al&s;o in his twelve volumes. TOMKIS certainly wrote well, and probably more than was attributed to him. We can point to no|thing, however, but <HI>Albumazar,</HI> from which DRY|DEN
<PB N="291" REF="296">
has accu&s;ed JONSON of having pil&s;ered his <HI>Alchymi&s;t.</HI> This fact has been warmly di&s;puted upon the old rotten ground of relying upon dates, which, in mo&s;t of the writers, &s;ub&s;tantiate that the <HI>Alchymi&s;t</HI> was performed four years before <HI>Albu|mazar</HI>; but we have &s;een how vague the&s;e &s;ort of authorities generally are and it is very unlikely that DRYDEN &s;hould commit him&s;elf upon this &s;ub|ject without being perfectly &s;atisfied of what he a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>MASON wrote a tragedy called <HI>Melea&s;tes the Turk,</HI> of which nothing is noticed but that the au|thor had a better opinion of it than it de&s;erved. MACHIN, who&s;e name has been re&s;cued from oblivion by DODSLEY, who publi&s;hed his comedy called The <HI>Dumb Knight,</HI> hardly de&s;erved that compliment, for it is one of the wor&s;t in the col|lection. SHARPMAN is &s;carcely known, and the poor glimmering of his merit that has reached us is through a borrowed light in the &s;hape of a comedy called The <HI>Fliere,</HI> which he &s;tole from MARSTON's <HI>Para&s;ita&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>GOSSON wrote three pieces, one of which was a Morality. They were not printed, and what we know of them from report is vague and unim|portant. TOURNEUR al&s;o wrote three pieces
<PB N="292" REF="297">
which we know as little about. A cotemporary has of him this notable remark.<Q><L>His fame unto that pitch was only rai&s;ed,</L>
<L>As not to be de&s;pi&s;ed, nor over prai&s;ed.</L></Q></P>
<P>WILKINS wrote a piece called The <HI>Mi&s;eries of enforced Marriage,</HI> which was very little celebrated, although Mrs. BEHN thought it worth while to &s;teal from it the plot of her comedy called The <HI>Town Fop.</HI> LEGG wrote two plays which were performed at CAMBRIDGE, where he was twice Vice Chan|cellor, &s;o there can be but little doubt of their having &s;ucceeded. They were not printed, how|ever, nor can any account be given of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e authors DYMOCK, BARRY, and others, make up all who, during the time of SHAKESPEAR and JONSON, were publicly known as dramatic writers; but there were anonymous plays produced to the number of about thirty, be&s;ides tho&s;e already mentioned, &s;ome of which are now known, and two or three of them are in DODSLEY's collection; and now, having pretty well cleared my ground, I &s;hall have better opportunity of giving fair play to JONSON; a review of the remainder of who&s;e works await the reader's attention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. JONSON RESUMED.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL now proceed to a final examination of the works of JONSON; who, after the death of ELIZA|BETH, produced one tragedy and nine comedies, be&s;ides a great variety of occa&s;ional complimentary ma&s;ques, principally in quality of poet laureat.</P>
<P><HI>Volpone; or the Fox,</HI> was performed in 1605, and has been generally con&s;idered as JONSON's be&s;t production. Certainly the plot is upon a very meritorous principal, and the characters are forcibly drawn. A knave who feigns illne&s;s in order to im|po&s;e upon knaves, and cheat them of their money by working up their credulity into a belief that each &s;hall become his heir, is one of the bolde&s;t ideas of a character that can be conceived, and yet moral ju&s;tice is rendered more complete by making that knave impo&s;ed upon by another of yet &s;uperior cunning; &s;hewing that the machinations of the wicked, be they ever &s;o &s;ubtle, are con&s;tantly coun|teracted by the &s;ame devil that in&s;pired them.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="299">The groop of characters that are introduced to work up tho&s;e materials, are full of contra&s;t, &s;trength, and nature; would not one think it, therefore, very extraordinary that this piece, even &s;upported by ad|mirable acting, has never greatly &s;ucceeded? No|thing, con&s;idered &s;uper&s;icially, can be &s;o unaccounta|ble; but, when the &s;ubject is fairly inve&s;tigated, no|thing can be more clearly comprehended. Quaint, dry, &s;tudied correctne&s;s, un&s;upported by quickne&s;s, &s;pirit, and fire, can never &s;atisfy. The author in this piece conducts us into a uniform and pro|tionable building, pre&s;ents us with an entertain|ment, and introduces us to company, but the apart|ments are cheerle&s;s vaults, the viands are carved marble, and the gue&s;ts are &s;tatues.</P>
<P>The &s;ame objections lie again&s;t the <HI>Silent Woman,</HI> though upon the whole, perhaps, it is a better play for general approbation; but it mu&s;t not be denied that with the &s;ame faults it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es at lea&s;t the &s;ame perfections. This piece is partly taken from OVID, partly from JUVENAL, and partly from PLAUTUS, and, therefore, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the merit of an excellent imitation; a quality JONSON was better acquainted with than invention. DRYDEN, has gone at large into an examination of this play, but nothing can prove that it has that &s;terling attraction which begets for a dramatic production univer&s;al &s;atisfaction; not even
<PB N="295" REF="300">
that judicious and &s;en&s;ible alteration of it by COL|MAN, which was brought out, yet not with very warm &s;ucce&s;s, in 1776, at Drury Lane.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ca&s;e is Altered,</HI> performed in 1609, is one of the poore&s;t of this author's productions. It is in &s;ome re&s;pects borrowed from PLAUTUS, but does no great credit either to the original or the imitator; in &s;hort, it is one of tho&s;e in&s;tances which we notice through all his works how bounded and contracted JONSON's talent's were; which &s;eldom reached to nature or her be&s;t imitators the Greeks, but were &s;atisfied with copying tho&s;e clum&s;y apes of them the Romans. What &s;hould we &s;ay of a &s;culptor who contentedly made MICHAEL ANGELO, admirable as he was, the exclu&s;ive model of his imi|tation, forgetting, or perhaps not knowing, that &s;uch an arti&s;t ever exi&s;ted as PHIDIAS.</P>
<P>The <HI>Alchymi&s;t</HI> was performed in 1610. This comedy, which was laudably written to ridicule a prevailing folly, mu&s;t, no doubt, have been greatly &s;ucce&s;sful originally, &s;ince we have &s;een it very much followed and admired during the time GAR|RICK ornamented the &s;tage. His incomparable performance, however, of ABEL DRUGGER was a con&s;iderable drawback from the proper reputation of the author, and in great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of the
<PB N="296" REF="301">
&s;ucce&s;s of the play; at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that the be&s;t acting can do nothing with|out good materials, with which certainly the <HI>Alchy|mi&s;t</HI> abounds.</P>
<P>JONSON's be&s;t po&s;ition as the foundation of his plays has been the old proverb,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"when knaves fall out hone&s;t men come by their own,"</Q>
and this he has often &s;ucce&s;sfully played upon. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance his knaves, by not being very great rogues, and by employing their art only to work upon cre|dulity, beget an uncommon intere&s;t, and the au|dience almo&s;t applaud the waggery of FACE, and the dry humour of SUBTLE, upon principle. The <HI>Alchymi&s;t,</HI> however, will probably never again be celebrated; but this is more owing to the &s;ubject, which of cour&s;e grows every day in a greater degree ob&s;olete, than to any deficiency in its dramatic re|qui&s;ites, although the in&s;uperable objection to JON|SON in a degree prevails here as well as every where el&s;e; for though his comic characters do not actually wear the bu&s;kin, yet the &s;ock has &s;uch high heels and is made of &s;uch &s;tiff materials, that the cha|racters &s;talk in&s;tead of trip, and thus we have quaint|ne&s;s for nature, affectation for grace, and awkward|ne&s;s for ea&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The farther we &s;earch, the more we &s;hall have rea&s;on to &s;upport DRYDEN in his opinion that the characters of the <HI>Alchymi&s;t</HI> was borrowed from <HI>Albumazar.</HI> LANGBAINE chu&s;es to be neuter upon this &s;ubject, but he does re&s;ort to the &s;illy doctrine of dates to defend either opinion. After all, however, we cannot doubt but DRYDEN would never have made &s;o po&s;itively and in &s;uch un|qualified terms, an a&s;&s;ertion of this kind without the cleare&s;t proof; but, if there were any material doubt, COXETER pretty well &s;ettles it by &s;hewing that <HI>Albumazar</HI> was written at a very early period but that it was common, on account of the manu&s;cript being kept un|printed in the hands of the actors, to date a play from the time it fir&s;t made its way into the world from the pre&s;s, in&s;tead of the period when it was originally performed, e&s;pecially the productions of ob&s;cure authors, and this ea&s;ily fini&s;hes the bu&s;ine&s;s; for TOMKIS, being very little known, found it difficult to get his play publi&s;hed, while JONSON took care, no doubt, to bring forward his productions, not only immediately on their fir&s;t appearance, but with all po&s;&s;ible pomp. The lines in DRYDEN's prologue are the&s;e:
<Q><L>SUBTLE was got by our ALBUMAZER,</L>
<L>That ALCHYMIST by that A&s;trologer;</L>
<L>Here he was fa&s;hion'd, and we may &s;uppo&s;e</L>

<P><PB N="297" REF="302"><HI>Bartholomew Fair,</HI> performed in 1614. This &s;trange play, out of which might be framed the hu|mour of half a dozen farces, is fuller, perhaps, of comic characters than any thing that ever appeared on the &s;tage. We are given to under&s;tand that JONSON wrote it purpo&s;ely to ridicule the age in which he lived, for the prevalent preference given to low wit, in&s;tead of poli&s;hed and refined writing. If this was his motive he has outwitted him&s;elf,

<P>He was one of tho&s;e, who, having no virtue in them&s;elves, hate virtue in others, for he never could bear to be upon terms with any but tho&s;e whom he de&s;pi&s;ed while he flattered, and who, &s;ucked in the nutriment for their vanity through his pro&s;tituted pen.</P>

not here, manife&s;ted &s;ound &s;en&s;e in his judgment of SHAKESHEAR's plays, &s;ays that the &s;erious language of <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure</HI> has more labour than ele|gance. If he looked in his own Dictionary for the etymology of elegance, which is there defined to be beauty without grandeur, he is right, for this lan|guage is &s;weetly beautiful and unaffectedly grand. The noble virtue, the true greatne&s;s, and the fe|minine honour of ISABELLA, are every where con|veyed through &s;entiments of re&s;pon&s;ive eloquence, and the great and commanding ju&s;tice of the Duke, who learns the temper of his &s;ubjects to govern them, and who chu&s;es for a wife the mo&s;t amiable of tho&s;e &s;ubjects, are dre&s;&s;ed in language no le&s;s con&s;onant. This &s;urely is grandeur of language, and, therefore, according to the Doctor, not ele|gance. I hope he was aware of the compliment this negative prai&s;e would pay SHAKESPEAR<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To &s;hew how little credit is to be attached to the <HI>ip&s;e dixits</HI> of great characters, beauty is here, by the Doctor, applied to language, and in his Dictionary he applies it only to objects. Thus, to prove that there is no &s;uch thing as human infallibility, celebrated opinions are perpetually at variance with general acceptations. Thus do Lord Chancellors rever&s;e their own decrees, and thus does even doctor JOHNSON contradict his own authority, being in this in&s;tance, if we quote him&s;elf, wrong in the application of two common words.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He al&s;o &s;ays the plot is more intricate than
<PB N="315" REF="320">
artful. This is &s;urely a contradiction in terms. Can there be intricacy without art, and is not a dramatic poet's be&s;t art to keep his plot intricate? But the&s;e are the critici&s;ms of tho&s;e who deal in epithets who weigh in&s;tead of feel, and who, in a fancied con&s;i|deration of what they are unequal to them&s;elves, &s;et up an imaginary &s;tandard of excellence for men who&s;e genius is &s;uperior to their comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>The plot of <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure</HI> is admirable both as a public and a private moral. The language is beautiful in the &s;erious parts, and ea&s;y and full of vicacity in the comic. The characters are perfectly natural and well con&s;tructed; and, were the unity of time correctly ob&s;erved, a matter however, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, of no moment, it would be at all points a complete dramatic production.</P>
<P><HI>Cymbeline,</HI> performed in 1604. Again&s;t this wonderful production has the pen of doctor JOHN|SON blurted out a mo&s;t unqualified and thought|le&s;s denunciation. His words are:
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"To remark the folly of the fiction, the ab&s;urdity of the con|duct, the confu&s;ion of the names, and manners of the different times, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of the events in any &s;y&s;tem of life, were to wa&s;te cri|tici&s;m upon unre&s;i&s;ting imbecility, upon faults
<PB N="316" REF="321">
too evident for detection, and too gro&s;s for aggravation."</Q></P>
<P>How much ea&s;ier it is to &s;ay this, than to de|fend it; and how much more do the&s;e &s;our, ha&s;ty, envious &s;trictures &s;peak the &s;narling cynic than the candid critic. Suppo&s;e every word of this chari|table declaration to be truth, ought a man to be tried only by his faults? Will doctor JOHNSON &s;ubmit to this ordeal? Are there no beauties in <HI>Cymbeline?</HI> Did not doctor JOHNSON know that when GARRICK performed POSTHUMUS, and for &s;ome years afterwards, particularly when POWELL came forward, that it was the delight of the public? And will SAMUEL JOHNSON &s;o far imitate his ex|emplar BEN as to &s;ay the public are a &s;et of &s;tupid idiots becau&s;e they do not admit the infallibility of his <HI>ip&s;e dixit?</HI> But let us &s;ee if the facts to which the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions relate will bear the doctor out.</P>
<P>The characteri&s;tic of that fiction which &s;erves the be&s;t purpo&s;es of morality, which teaches &s;uffer|ing innocence to wait patiently its recompence, which puni&s;hes vice and rewards virtue, is not <Q REND="inline">"folly;"</Q> that conduct by which the&s;e ends are accompli&s;hed is not <Q REND="inline">"ab&s;urdity;"</Q> tho&s;e events on which that con|duct is founded are not <Q REND="inline">"impo&s;&s;ibilities,"</Q> therefore
<PB N="317" REF="322">
&s;o far the Doctor is un&s;upported by truth. No|thing can be more moral, more intere&s;ting, more po&s;&s;ible than the plot of <HI>Cymbeline.</HI></P>
<P>If the puni&s;hment of the pre&s;umptuous IACHIMO, the fool CLOTEN, and the wicked &s;tepmother Queen, the reward of the &s;weetly enduring IMOGEN, and the generou&s;ly mi&s;taken POSTHUMUS, the re&s;to|ration of the di&s;gui&s;ed Princes to their father, who had been deceived and mi&s;led, and the kingdom to peace and to happine&s;s, is not moral and truly tho&s;e very circum&s;tances which con&s;titute the be&s;t pur|po&s;es of the drama, what is?</P>
<P>Such events as the&s;e may be conducted by means too intricate, and I am the fir&s;t to confe&s;s that the&s;e are the faults of this play; but to &s;ay that they are &s;o <Q REND="inline">"gro&s;s,"</Q> &s;o unpardonable, as we are taught by doctor JOHNSON to believe, and that <HI>Cymbeline</HI> is therefore a ma&s;s of <Q REND="inline">"unre&s;i&s;ting imbecility,"</Q> would be to write a libel upon the whole kingdom; many of whom have the &s;tory, bad as it is, rivetted in their memories, and can repeat numberle&s;s of the mo&s;t beautiful pa&s;&s;ages in it by heart. Even VOL|TAIRE is obliged to allow this; why will not doctor JOHNSON?</P>
<P>The &s;tory of <HI>Cymbeline</HI> is uncommonly dra|matic,
<PB N="318" REF="323">
and after all the cavilling in the world the utmo&s;t that can be &s;aid about it is, that, though the play has but one plot, it has &s;everal epi&s;odes. The outline of the plot, however, is perfectly &s;imple, and attempts at no more than, what SHAKESPEAR has accompli&s;hed in his <HI>Mea&s;ure for Mea&s;ure</HI> and other plays, the re&s;toration of private happine&s;s and public tranquility.</P>
<P>The tree it mu&s;t be granted has many branches and yet it is extremely difficult to know where to lop, le&s;t not only deformity &s;hould &s;ucceed &s;myetry, but that &s;ome vital part &s;hould be wounded; pruning therefore was all that could be found practicable, and this was &s;o well done by GARRICK, in a con|&s;ultation of his friends, that I believe it would be a difficulty to find a play on the &s;tage that now, as well as at the time doctor JOHNSON &s;aw it, could be entitled to a greater degree of reputation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le&s;t I &s;hould unequivocally commit my&s;elf as one of tho&s;e Engli&s;hmen who, according to VOLTAIRE, can admire nothing but proce&s;&s;ions, boxing, and bull-baiting, and who in particular, on the &s;tage, are for daggers, &s;kulls, gho&s;ts, and other objects of horror, or they &s;leep, I beg leave to &s;ay that though I may have plea&s;ure now and then in baiting a bear, or cha&s;ti&s;ing a monkey, I am an inveterate enemy to all auxiliary helps, and think the &s;tage poluted by &s;uch mon&s;trous and unnece&s;&s;ary introductions; and I have no objection to &s;ay that I am &s;o fond of real dignity and &s;imple greatne&s;s that, were it not in places unnece&s;&s;arily tame, I &s;hould con&s;ider <HI>Zara</HI> as a per|fect model for correct tragedy; but is this a rea&s;on that becau&s;e there are &s;ubjects in their nature complex they are entirely to be thru&s;t from the &s;tage? On the contrary if plots are not inexplicable, where grandeur is intended, no matter how much the author goes for an expan&s;ion of the mind; and this is not a proof that the phleg|matic tempers of the Engli&s;h require to be rou&s;ed by affecting ob|jects, but that their minds are capacious enough to admit whatever is intere&s;ting and grand, in&s;tead of being &s;atisfied with vapidity and refinement.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="324">The <HI>London Prodigal,</HI> performed in 1605. As this play has with one voice been voted not to have been written by SHAKESPEAR, my <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> could be of little con&s;equence were I to give a contrary opinion which, however, no man can do who takes the trouble to peru&s;e it.</P>
<P>It has been remarked that two things are extra|ordinary relative to this play; one, that it &s;hould be publicly acted at SHAKESPEAR's own theatre with his name affixed to it, and the other, that he &s;hould be &s;o negligent of his fame as to &s;uffer &s;uch an im|putation to pa&s;s unnoticed. The fir&s;t, if true, would be extraordinary enough; but there is no ma|terial proof of its truth and, again&s;t mere report, which I have frequently &s;hewn has been &s;eldom upon the&s;e occa&s;ions to be relied on, we have the po&s;itive evidence of our &s;en&s;es that it would be im|po&s;&s;ible for SHAKESPEAR to have admitted of a
<PB N="320" REF="325">
&s;purious piece that would either ri&s;k or a&s;&s;i&s;t his reputation, the &s;plendor of his talents, and the recti|tude of his conduct giving the lie completely to &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition; and for the la&s;t, if it was only imagined by the world in general to have been written by SHAKESPEAR it would have been an im|peachment of tho&s;e talents and that rectitude, had he for a &s;ingle moment thought it worth his while to refute the calumny.</P>
<P><HI>King Lear,</HI> produced in 1608. To dwell upon beauties that all the world knows and feels is nei|ther novel, nor nece&s;&s;ary. As it is, however, im|po&s;&s;ible to withhold one's admiration of any thing &s;ingularly meritorious we are not only entitled to pardon but thanks for endeavouring, by fre&s;h ob&s;er|vation, to revive a &s;ubject that has given and will for ever give univer&s;al delight.</P>
<P>Upon this principal, if we only bring to public recollection tho&s;e beauties in this a&s;toni&s;hing play, on which they have &s;o often dwelt, and with &s;o much plea&s;ure, offering the &s;ame pro&s;pects yet al|tering the lights and the &s;hadows, the merit of the &s;ubject may recommend the portrait to notice.</P>
<P>In <HI>King Lear</HI> the three grand ends of tragedy are completely effected. Pity, terror, and delight, have
<PB N="321" REF="326">
an equal &s;hare of this admirable compo&s;ition and &s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes another, and often all of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are excited, in a manner ma&s;terly even to a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Can pity be more beautifully awakened than in the &s;ufferings of the loyal and venerable GLOSTER, the mi&s;eries unnaturally inflicted on the tender, cre|dulous, choleric, but noble LEAR, or the unavailing filial piety of the angelic CORDELIA? Can terror be more tremendou&s;ly rou&s;ed than by the wicked|ne&s;s of GONERIL and REGAN, or the blind adop|tion of EDMUND by GLOSTER? Can delight be more legitimately gratified than by the conque&s;t of &s;truggling virtue over inordinate vice?</P>
<P>If the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are called forth with all this ve|hemence, with all this art, and with all this truth, how much mu&s;t we admire the judgment with which they are applied. It is not in tragedy who dies, but who dies lamented, and who execrated. Here are a knot of virtue's be&s;t votaries, of honour's true&s;t advocates; they live to behold the di&s;com|fiture of their enemies, but it is then too late to re|pair that ruin of which their imprudence had been the cau&s;e. On the other hand the infamous &s;et who
<PB N="322" REF="327">
had dared to put nature, honour, and decency at defiance, fall execrated even by one another.</P>
<P>LEAR, in mind an angel, in temper a man, hopes, by exerci&s;ing an act of unparalleled genero&s;ity, to be thanked and admired by all the world; and in particular by tho&s;e on whom he has conferred this extraordinary benefit. He finds him&s;elf di&s;appointed at &s;etting out by the ob&s;tinacy of that daughter whom mo&s;t he loved, and from whom he expected the mo&s;t unequivocal obedience. He is naturally choleric, and, from that moment to the end of his life, meet|ing with nothing but contradiction and provocation, which is wound up to a paroxy&s;m at lo&s;ing CORDE|LIA, who&s;e duty he had ju&s;t recognized, and who comes to deliver him from his enemies, life becomes a torment, and his death is inevitable, and conveys in a mo&s;t &s;olemn moral, how much mi&s;chief may be cau&s;ed by one &s;ingle act of imprudence. GLOSTER is in the &s;ame predicament.</P>
<P>The rapidity, yet the collectedne&s;s, with which the mind accompanies the author from one &s;ituation to another is re&s;i&s;tle&s;s, and the conduct of the ac|tion is &s;o correct and &s;pirited that it does not &s;ink for a &s;ingle moment. As for the di&s;crimination, the &s;ingle circum&s;tance of the di&s;tinction between the
<PB N="323" REF="328">
feigned madne&s;s of EDGAR and the real madne&s;s of LEAR, is enough to &s;tamp the judgment of the poet with &s;uperlative reputation.</P>
<P>But what pen &s;hall do ju&s;tice to the language? None but his own; nor can any thing but quotations from SHAKESPEAR ever illu&s;trate him. When LEAR corrects his ha&s;tine&s;s, and flatters him&s;elf that CORN|WALL's rea&s;on for not &s;eeing him is indi&s;po&s;ition, not arrogance, how charming are the&s;e lines.<Q><SP>
<L>may be, he is not well;</L>

<L>Whereto our health is bound; we are not our&s;elves,</L>
<L>When nature being oppre&s;&s;ed, commands the mind</L>
<L>To &s;uffer with the body.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The epithet <Q REND="inline">"commands"</Q> is exqui&s;ite. How greatly maje&s;tic is the language of LEAR in the &s;torm? How grand are the fir&s;t &s;ix words?<Q><SP>
<L>Blow winds, and crack your cheeks!</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The image conveyed in calling the fla&s;hes of lightening, in the &s;ame &s;peech,
<Q><SP>
<L>vant-couriers to oak-rending thunderbolts</L>
</SP></Q>
is greatly poetic. The next &s;peech in which he deprecates the elements, yet accu&s;es them with joining with his daughters again&s;t a head &s;o old
<PB N="324" REF="329">
and white as his, is facinating as well as the beau|tiful tran&s;ition
<Q><SP>
<L>No, I will be the pattern of all patience,</L>
<L>I will &s;ay nothing.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Further on, where he dares the guilty to face the &s;torm and bear the admonitions of their own gnawing con&s;ciences, is another happy and bold object in the groupe, which again changes mo&s;t fe|licitou&s;ly to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own rectitude, in the words
<Q><SP>
<L>I am a man</L>
<L>More &s;inned again&s;t than &s;inning.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>As the reflections are more and more en|duced by the objects of horror that &s;urround him, they become more and more poignant, noble, and profound. What for &s;implicity, for truth, for grandeur, and for conviction can exceed this?<Q><SP>
<L>Filial ingratitude!</L>
<L>Is it not as this mouth &s;hould tear this hand,</L>
<L>For lifting food to it?</L>
</SP></Q> And then how melting is the following exclamation;
<Q><SP>
<L>In &s;uch a night</L>

</SP></Q>
afterwards, upon the approach of another mi&s;erable

<P>The&s;e are a very few of the beauties of <HI>Lear;</HI> a play that might erect a monument of fame, not only for the author him&s;elf, but for the country in which he wrote. In &s;hort the faults of this play
<PB N="326" REF="331">
are trivial, the merits are magnificent; and the fair judgment on it may be reduced to this. It is as its &s;tands equal to any thing for the clo&s;et, for even the fool, though he retards the action, is full of ex|qui&s;ite wit, and with a very few judicious alterations it would make a mo&s;t complete tragedy for the &s;tage. The piece, however, is certainly injured by the admitted alteration by TATE, becau&s;e it takes away from the grandeur of the original plot and the ju&s;tice of the cata&s;trophe. COLMAN brought out at Covent Garden a better alteration, but the idea of &s;eeing the play end happily, which is from the pur|po&s;e of tragedy, has now obtained, and, TATE hav|ing the voice of the public in his favour, it is very unlikely that any other alteration will be attempted.</P>
<P><HI>Macbeth,</HI> brought forward in 1606. When we look at the many, the extraordinary, the exqui&s;ite beauties of <HI>Lear,</HI> it is &s;omething more than won|derful that on the following year SHAKESPEAR could produce <HI>Macbeth,</HI> a tragedy &s;o well invented, &s;o greatly conducted, and &s;o inimitably written. <HI>Lear</HI> unites many intere&s;ts, and intere&s;ts many pa&s;&s;ions; <HI>Macbeth</HI> illu&s;trates one pa&s;&s;ion alone, from which many intere&s;ts i&s;&s;ue; and in this it is &s;uperior to <HI>Lear,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ingle moral enforced is never ab&s;ent from the mind.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="332">Where &s;hall we find ambition, its terrible and de&s;tructive con&s;equences, and its dreadful and head|long downfall &s;o vividly de&s;cribed? Here, indeed, is terror laudably and &s;trongly excited. 'Tis little to &s;ay that there is nothing in literature equal to it. We have &s;een mon&s;ters in nature, going from one ferocity to another, deface countries, depopulate nations, and &s;tand like in&s;atiate tygers grinning over their trembling prey; but it was re&s;erved for SHAKESPEAR to mould a man who had bought <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"golden opinions of the world"</Q> into a mon&s;ter, and gradually plunge him into &s;uch iniquity that his example one &s;hould think would bani&s;h ambition from the world for ever.</P>
<P>Thus the principal character in the picture is con&s;tantly held up to you, always in a different at|titude, and each attitude more terrific than that which went before it. When MACBETH returned from the field, where he had gloriou&s;ly ju&s;tified his &s;overeign and pre&s;erved his country, his mind was occupied with reflections too noble to have hailed the honours that were thickening about him, other|wi&s;e than by their fair and legitimate title; nor, till the Devil, in the &s;hape of the weird &s;i&s;ters, tempted him to his ruin, and in&s;pired his wife to forward their infernal purpo&s;e, did he in the &s;malle&s;t degree &s;hrink from his fealty.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="333">How beautifully manife&s;t is this in his conflicts with him&s;elf. He is fir&s;t timid, then wavering, then determined, then guilty; and, what is ma&s;terly, even to wonder, he neither &s;ees his actual danger, nor que&s;tions the ambiguity of his tempters, till he has atchieved the end of his ambition. Thus he hurries from de&s;peration to de&s;peration; yet, &s;till retaining &s;ome faint colour of his original nature through his numerous and &s;anguinary villanies, he deplores his wickedne&s;s with philo&s;ophy, and holds his courage to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>As to keep up the con&s;tant excitement of terror and to warn the &s;pectator into virtue, is the great object of this tragedy, &s;o the means to attain that object are as a&s;toni&s;hingly pur&s;ued as they are various and material. The prophe&s;y of the witches on the barren heath, the temptation of lady MACBETH, the ap|pearance of BANQUO's gho&s;t, lady MACBETH's con|fe&s;&s;ing her crimes in her &s;leep, the deception of the witches in the cavern, which opens his mind to the folly of his tru&s;ting the Devil that had deceived him, are the &s;teps that gradually lead to that height of de&s;pair from which he can neither advance nor retreat; and the few grains of pity at his fall, which are mixed with univer&s;al execration, make the example more terrible, for they remind us that this fiend was a human creature.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="334">As to the language of MACBETH take it for na|ture, for truth, for grandeur, for pathos, or indeed for any other particular excellence, to read it is to rivet the attention, and to ta&s;te it to compliment the under&s;tanding. It would take a volume to de&s;cribe its beauties, and when the willing ta&s;k were performed it would be as vain and as u&s;ele&s;s as to de&s;cribe daylight.</P>
<P>The imputed fault of this play is that its au|thor has called in &s;upernatural agents; but, though there are &s;ome writers that had better avoid this, I believe all readers of ta&s;te will pardon it in SHAKESPEAR. Certainly credulity might have been played on through the medium of dreams, and various other means; but SHAKESPEAR has in <HI>Macbeth</HI> given us a Scotti&s;h &s;tory, and, therefore, introduced us to people who had a &s;trong belief in witches, &s;econd &s;ight, and who indulged them&s;elves in other &s;uper&s;titious whims; be&s;ides to warn the weak and credulous again&s;t illu&s;ive predictions was here mo&s;t laudable, and this even doctor JOHNSON defends, who &s;ays SHAKESPEAR was right to do this, though &s;ome parts of this expedient may now &s;eem improbable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not the only place where the Doctor has inclined to|wards a belief of the real exi&s;tence of &s;upernatural beings and their influence over mankind. In his <HI>Prince of Aby&s;&s;inia,</HI> and his <HI>Tour to the Hebrides,</HI> it is pretty manife&s;t; and, indeed, however he may in different places have abu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ible and &s;ometimes beautiful pa&s;&s;ages in SHAKESPEAR, he has generally forgiven his &s;lights to fairy land, and tho&s;e truly happy creations which though in doctrine they inculcate illu&s;ion in writing plea&s;e and a&s;toni&s;h the fancy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="335">But let me be forgiven for indulging my&s;elf in a few quotations. I &s;hall not follow any chain but take them at random. MACBETH thus argues with him&s;elf.<Q><SP>

<P>In the fifth act, when MACBETH, driven to the toil and hopele&s;s, begins to feel the approaches of de&s;pair, and looks every where in vain for a re|&s;ource, he deplores his mi&s;pent life in the&s;e words:

</SP></Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall here re&s;train my plea&s;ure, and leave the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages from MACBETH warm with the reader, to &s;peak its commendation.</P>
<P>After &s;o much violent exerci&s;e of the mind, no wonder SHAKESPEAR &s;hould, in his next production, feel him&s;elf inclined to treat a comic &s;ubject. The <HI>Taming of the Shrew</HI> came out the &s;ame year as <HI>Macbeth,</HI> on which comedy I &s;hall have the le&s;s to &s;ay, having already de&s;cribed its merits when I &s;poke of it in oppo&s;ition to FLETCHER's play of the <HI>Woman's Prize.</HI> It has great merit, as the world can witne&s;s for me, but its grand fault is that there are in it two plots in&s;tead of a plot and an epi&s;ode, and therefore the whole play never had brilliant &s;ucce&s;s. The comedy, however, which we know under the title of <HI>Catherine and Petruchio,</HI> and which is an alteration by GARRICK from SHAKES|PEAR, is perfect in all its parts, and will no doubt be con&s;tantly a favourite with the public as long as true humour is con&s;idered as a requi&s;ite in comedy.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> which play SHAKESPEAR pro|duced the following year, the critics have com|plained
<PB N="334" REF="339">
becau&s;e that warrior's death did not make up the cata&s;trophe of the piece. Had this been the ca&s;e, however, the author mu&s;t have u&s;ed in every re&s;pect different materials, and have wrought his piece upon an entirely different plan; for it was not his intention merely to &s;hew the workings of the con&s;piracy, till its meditated con&s;ummation and there leave it, but to di&s;play the con&s;equences of that a&s;&s;a&s;ination.</P>
<P>As the&s;e, however, are fairly wrought up, and productive of great intere&s;t and variety, I believe there are few who regret that SHAKESPEAR took this cour&s;e. For one thing it would have been a pity to have lo&s;t the &s;peeches of BRUTUS and AN|TONY over the body of CAESAR, which contain perhaps, &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;terling oratory to be found in any language, not excepting the con|tention of AJAX and ULYSSES for the armour of ACHILLES.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed the unities are all broken, and there is much extraneous matter brought into the piece, but the inimitable beauties that &s;o thickly pervade it &s;pring out of the&s;e circum&s;tances, nor do we &s;o much incline to cavil at this inconguity, &s;ince we &s;ee through it trea&s;on di&s;comfitted, and the death of CAESAR revenged.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="340">But if, upon the whole, the features of this tragedy are more ma&s;&s;ed than &s;haped, we are greatly recom|penced by peculiar beauties, however extraneous. The &s;cene of BRUTUS and PORTIA, though it comes to nothing, is very fine; &s;o is that of CAESAR and CALPHURNIA; and, perhaps, there never was a grander picture of the infirmity of human nature than the quarrel and reconciliation of BRUTUS and and CASSIUS. The very gho&s;t of CAESAR is awful in the extreme; and, &s;o intimidates the army of the con&s;pirators, that it may properly be &s;aid CAESAR is his own avenger.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, con&s;ider this play as a regular tragedy, it is faulty in many points, con&s;ider it as hi&s;torical it is &s;upportable; but, con&s;ider it as an effort of genius, and it is incomparable.</P>
<P><HI>A York&s;hire Tragedy,</HI> produced in 1608; is by &s;ome attributed to SHAKESPEAR; as however all his commentators, except Mr. STEEVENS, have agreed to reject it, to avoid unnece&s;&s;ary cavil, we will agree &s;o far with them as to &s;ay that it &s;eems to &s;tand in a predicament &s;omething between <HI>Pericles,</HI> and <HI>Locrine</HI>; for though there are evidently many images which appear to have emanated from the mind of SHAKESPEAR, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages &s;eem rather
<PB N="336" REF="341">
to have been written for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another than that the whole belonged to him&s;elf. Let the belief, however, re&s;t either way, the merit of it can|not a&s;&s;i&s;t any more than the imperfections of it can dimini&s;h his reputation.</P>
<P><HI>Anthony and Cleopatra</HI> was performed 1608. This play from which was formed the materials for DRYDEN's <HI>All for Love,</HI> a tragedy of mo&s;t inimi|table beauty, in many in&s;tances however tran&s;cends it, and would never probably have been touched by that exqui&s;ite poet, had not the unities been &s;o ill pur&s;ued in SHAKESPEAR that the mind cannot ac|commodate it&s;elf to &s;uch a &s;tretch of probability.</P>
<P>SHAKESPEAR's play takes in part of the life of FULVIA, her death, ANTHONY's return to ROME, his marriage with OCTAVIA, his return to CLEO|PATRA, the battle of ACTIUM, ANTHONY's death, and CLEOPATRA's captivity and death; and, if the que&s;tion had been for an author to have wrought intere&s;t out of complexity, SHAKESPEAR has greatly accompli&s;hed this end; for, in the words of doctor JONSON,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the continual hurry of the action, the variety of incidents, and the quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of one per&s;onage to another call the mind forward without intermi&s;&s;ion from the fir&s;t act to the la&s;t."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="342">It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed this intere&s;t is more extraneous than collected, or rather there are a number of broken intere&s;ts which &s;pring more from novelty than reflection; thus, though there are many great and admirable particular beauties, the conduct is disjointed, and the plea&s;ure we receive it di&s;tracted by perpetual interruption.</P>
<P>The characters of the piece are well drawn. You &s;ee in ANTONY, in ROME, the &s;ame artful orator that &s;tirred the Romans again&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of CAESAR, and, in EGYPT, the fond, the doating, the credulous lover that lo&s;t his world by gazing. The imbecility of LEPIDUS, is as powerfully drawn, and &s;o is the cunning of OCTAVIUS CAESAR, who depo&s;es LEPIDUS at plea&s;ure, and makes the in|juries of his &s;i&s;ter a pretence to de&s;troy his more noble but infatuated rival.</P>
<P>CLEOPATRA is drawn in a yet more ma&s;terly &s;tyle; and, le&s;t we &s;hould &s;ail to lo&s;e her enticing image for a moment, the de&s;cription of ANTONY's meeting her upon the river CYDNOS, &s;peaks a hi&s;tory of her and all &s;uch voluptuous &s;yrens. The bur|ni&s;hed gold that burnt on the water, the flutes that kept time to the oars, the purple &s;ails, the &s;ilk tack|ling, &s;he reclining in her pavillion, the boys like
<PB N="338" REF="343">
&s;miling Cupids fanning her, her nymphs like Ne|reides, the incen&s;e that perfumed the air, all com|bine to conquer the conqueror ANTONY.</P>
<P>This is her fir&s;t &s;troke of art. Afterwards by how many matchle&s;s graces does &s;he en&s;lave him; and, unfortunately every way for ANTONY, his fir&s;t wife was ugly, and his &s;econd he married merely to patch up a truce with OCTAVIUS CAESAR; who, afterwards con&s;olidated the empire in him&s;elf, and acquired the title of AUGUSTUS by working on the different weakne&s;&s;es of ANTONY and LEPIDUS.</P>
<P>The whole of CLEOPATRA's conduct is con|&s;i&s;tently worked up; the &s;ame ingredients are every where infu&s;ed; and ardent love, quick jealou&s;y, unconquerable pride, con&s;cious dignity, and con|&s;cious levity, are evident in every look, word, and motion, and therefore her language is made to con&s;i&s;t of rapture, reproach, haughtine&s;s, eloquence, and blandi&s;hment. This portrait of her we receive at the hands of SHAKESPEAR; and, whether we &s;ee her parting from ANTONY, &s;tudying to endure his ab&s;ence, receiving the news of his &s;econd marriage, greeting him on his return, provoking him to fight by &s;ea at ACTIUM, con&s;oling him on his defeat, playing him fal&s;e with CAESAR's amba&s;&s;ador, luring him into &s;ecurity, helping him on with his armour,
<PB N="339" REF="344">
congratulating him on his victory by land, endur|ing his death, re&s;olving her own; each &s;cene, each &s;peech, has a &s;hare of the&s;e and other corre&s;pond|ing qualities.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome admirable &s;ubordinate points mo&s;t nobly introduced; among the&s;e are CAESAR's cool reception of tho&s;e friends who have fallen off from ANTONY, the apo&s;tacy and compunction of ENOBARBUS, and that exqui&s;ite trait of honour in POMPEY; who, when he is per&s;uaded by MENAS aboard the galley, to di&s;po&s;e of ANTONY, CAESAR, and LEPIDUS, and be conqueror of the world, greatly rejects the offer, becau&s;e they are his gue&s;ts, in the&s;e words:
<Q><SP>
<L>All this tho&s;e &s;hould'&s;t have done</L>
<L>And not have &s;poke of it! In me 'tis villany,</L>
<L>In thee it had been good &s;ervice.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>But tho&s;e who would know the admirable and various beauties of this greatly meritorious pro|duction mu&s;t read it, and it will then be found that, whatever general faults it may have in its component parts as one piece, it has particular excellence enough to furni&s;h materials for the whole reputation of any rea&s;onable author.</P>
<P><HI>Coriolanus</HI> performed in 1609. Men of extra|ordinary
<PB N="340" REF="345">
genius chu&s;e &s;ometimes unproductive &s;ub|jects to work upon, in order to &s;hew with what art and management they can conquer the mo&s;t irre|concileable difficulties. To reduce the hi&s;tory of CORIOLANUS into a play was one of tho&s;e labours, which our dramatic Hercules has atchieved in a mo&s;t wonderful manner; but after all, the labour is &s;carcely worth the pains, for, except the &s;ingularly noble character of CORIOLANUS, there is nothing correctly great in the piece.</P>
<P>The high &s;pirit of VOLUMNIA is neither great|ne&s;s nor dignity; it is merely loftine&s;s. She con|ceives her&s;elf a Spartan mother, and would &s;acrifice every thing to her &s;on's honour, and &s;he per&s;uades him to deba&s;e him&s;elf by flattering the people to ob|tain the con&s;ul&s;hip; and when, upon nobly di&s;dain|ing to follow &s;uch unworthy advice, he is bani&s;hed that country which he had pre&s;erved, and driven by its ingratitude to take up arms again&s;t it, &s;he once more tries her influence over him by which means a &s;lavi&s;h peace is patched up for ROME, which ter|minates in the triumph of his enemies and the ac|compli&s;hment of his death by the ungrateful Vol|cians, whom he had imprudently &s;erved.</P>
<P>Thus there is nothing effectual nor ju&s;tifiable, taken upon poetic ground, in the cata&s;trophe.
<PB N="341" REF="346">
MENENIUS, with all his friend&s;hip and good na|ture, is &s;et down where he was taken up, he neither does good nor harm. The tribunes, SICINIUS, and BRUTUS, who de&s;erve more the Tarpeian death than CORIOLANUS does bani&s;hment, in&s;tead of being puni&s;hed, live and are happy, and VOLUMNIA, VIR|GILIA, and her children exi&s;t to deplore the death of the &s;on, the hu&s;band, and the father, and the folly of having intruded on him their officious, weak, and unavailing virtue.</P>
<P>If SHAKESPEAR had departed from hi&s;tory, this play with a very little trouble to him would have been complete even to perfection. Who does not &s;ee that, if the Volcians had bravely re&s;i&s;ted the calumny of AUFIDIUS, puni&s;hed him for his per|fidy, and made the re&s;toration of CORIOLANUS to his country the terms of a la&s;ting and honourable peace, the cata&s;trophe would have been correctly poetical, and that a mo&s;t patriotic moral would have been inculcated.</P>
<P>As it is, however, one very &s;trong le&s;&s;on is en|forced; that it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;erve the ungrateful, and that the puni&s;hment of the wicked may be &s;afely tru&s;ted to the hands of fate.</P>
<P>For the language; the beauties of SHAKES|PEAR
<PB N="342" REF="347">
are always re&s;plendant, and his diction always appropriate; which we &s;hall con&s;tantly find in this play; whether we trace the mind of the truly no|ble CORIOLANUS, the fondly proud VOLMUNIA, the da&s;tardly envious AUFIDIUS, the &s;imply hone&s;t MENENIUS, or the ra&s;cally artful Tribunes, who&s;e ba&s;e minds never could forgive &s;uch taunts as the&s;e.<Q><SP>

</SP></Q></P>
<P>But I &s;hall not have &s;pace for extracts, and mu&s;t therefore refer the reader to the play.</P>
<P>We have next in <HI>Timon of Athens,</HI> which was brought out in 1610, a kind of <HI>Coriolanus</HI> of an|other &s;pecies, as fortunately handled, and more hap|pily conceived, becau&s;e private and dome&s;tic virtue is more a &s;ubject for the heart than public and pa|triotic. The ingratitude of which CORIOLANUS has to complain is from his country, that of TIMON is from his friends; one &s;ubject therefore is grand, the other pathetic, one great, the other intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>It is on this account that <HI>Timon of Athens</HI> arre&s;ts the attention to a degree of facination, and yet
<PB N="343" REF="348">
TIMON is not &s;o much pitied as that ingratitude is deplored; for there is a degree of oftentation an|nexed to his character, and therefore his liberality has a &s;pecies of prodigality in it, and his genero&s;ity is rather &s;plendour than munificence.</P>
<P>All the&s;e &s;hades of di&s;tinction SHAKESPEAR has mo&s;t beautifully pre&s;erved, and, indeed, it &s;eems every where to have been his darling &s;tudy rather to warn men again&s;t imprudence, which may be avoided, or at lea&s;t remedied, than the vices i&s;&s;uing from it, which when once committed are hopele&s;s and without remedy.</P>
<P>TIMON gives; but we hear nothing of his re|lieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of hone&s;t poverty, nece&s;&s;itous virtue, or unrewarded merit, and, therefore, he is not munificent; he is vulnerable to flattery and pays the price of it, he gives to tho&s;e who have enough already, he lavi&s;hes till his coffers are empty, and his lands mortgaged to pamper tho&s;e he knows to be unde&s;erving; this is not munificence.</P>
<P>But this is not all. He is aware of the ruin he &s;eeks, he falls by choice; nor is it nece&s;&s;ary, his follies are &s;o glaring, &s;o palpable, &s;o known to him|&s;elf, that his amiable and friendly &s;teward &s;hould
<PB N="344" REF="349">
per&s;uade him, or the blunt APEMANTUS rail him out of his imprudence.</P>
<P>This, however, does not palliate the infamy of their ingratitude who, pampered and enriched by his bounty, de&s;ert him in his di&s;tre&s;s. The &s;tamp of their apo&s;tacy, of their villany, of their meanne&s;s is indelible. They are, as TIMON him&s;elf &s;tyles them,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"courteous de&s;troyers, affable wolves, meek bears, trencher friends, time's flies, cap and knee &s;laves, vapours and minute jacks."</Q></P>
<P>Thus all the puni&s;hments and rewards are equi|table. TIMON &s;uffers for his imprudence; he is ruined by prodigality and folly, and requited by vexation and di&s;appointment. The Athenians are &s;courged and are &s;unk into &s;hame and remor&s;e at the recollection of their ingratitude to TIMON, and ALCIBIADES, the de&s;truction of who&s;e mutual ene|mies is in&s;i&s;ted on, as the guarantee of peace with ATHENS. Nay even their own gold, which they had penuriou&s;ly hid, is made the in&s;trument of their cha&s;ti&s;ement at the very hands of tho&s;e they had wronged, for it is found by TIMON, and applied to encourage the army of ALCIBIADES.</P>
<P>The warmth and &s;pirit of the language, in many
<PB N="345" REF="350">
places, has no parallel even in SHAKESPEAR; but its great beauty is its con&s;i&s;tency. TIMON, always in extremes, execrates the whole human race for in|gratitude he has experienced only from the Athe|nians, while APEMANTUS, con&s;titutionally a mi&s;an|thrope, makes no di&s;tinction between TIMON in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, but rails at his folly in both &s;ituations, and tells him rude but hone&s;t truths.</P>
<P>When TIMON, in the fir&s;t act, tells him he is proud, he &s;ays he is proud of nothing &s;o much as that he is not like TIMON. When he a&s;ks him to dine; no, &s;ays he, <Q REND="inline">"I eat not Lords!"</Q> and after|wards to the poet, &s;peaking of TIMON,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"He is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy labour; he that loves to be flattered is worthy of the flatterer."</Q>
He &s;ays to TIMON at the dinner:
<Q><SP>
<L>I &s;corn thy meat; 'twould choke me for I &s;hould</L>
<L>Ne'er flatter thee.</L>
</SP></Q>
and then, for proof of his &s;incerity, he thus apro&s;|trophizes.<Q><SP>
<L>O you Gods what a number</L>
<L>Of men eat TIMON and he &s;ees them not!</L>
<L>It grieves me to &s;ee &s;o many dip their meat</L>
<L>In one man's blood; and all the madne&s;s is</L>
<L>He cheers them up too.</L>

<P>The language of TIMON is all blandi&s;hment in pro&s;perity, all execration in adver&s;ity, and SHAKES|PEAR has done well in making APEMANTUS &s;ay to him,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"The middle of humanity thou never knewe&s;t."</Q></P>

<P>Numberle&s;s traits of this nature may be &s;ound in this admirable piece of exqui&s;ite writing, with one more of which I mu&s;t content my&s;elf. When TIMON, through the repre&s;entation of his &s;teward, finds him&s;elf reduced to ruin, he exclaims, with a&s;toni&s;hment:

<P>We come next to the be&s;t play upon the whole of SHAKESPEAR, and &s;aying this it naturally follows that it is the be&s;t the world can produce. <HI>Othello</HI> was performed in 1611. Works of great merit, which carry with them the criterion of excellence, &s;oar &s;o far above prai&s;e that the able&s;t pens and the warme&s;t inclinations are inadequate to do them ju&s;tice, and even doctor JOHNSON has hand&s;omely allowed, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the beauties of this play impre&s;s them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly upon the reader that they draw no aid from critical illu&s;tration."</Q></P>
<P>The more re&s;plendant, however, great and a&s;toni&s;hing objects are, and the admiration of them is diffu&s;ed and general, the more do they extort from us involuntary prai&s;e. They are like our common &s;alutations on the ble&s;&s;ings of health and the beauty of the weather; which, though they are &s;imple and &s;elf evident, are always eloquent, becau&s;e they are &s;incere and heartfelt.</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe the noble, vivid, and hone&s;t mind of the honourable and abu&s;ed OTHELLO; violent in his love, &s;low in his &s;u&s;picious, and terrible in his revenge, mu&s;t be done invariably by every writer in the &s;ame language, for there cannot be
<PB N="350" REF="355">
two ways of explaining what every body have agreed upon.</P>
<P>The &s;ubtle, fullen, &s;tudied villany of the cold blooded IAGO; in&s;en&s;ible to honour, friend&s;hip, and gratitude; who laughs at con&s;cience, &s;purns at genero&s;ity, and wounds virtue; and the &s;weetly innocent DESDEMONA; who, having in the choice of her hu&s;band given proof of boundle&s;s confidence and di&s;intere&s;tne&s;s, and, therefore, cannot conceive the po&s;ibility in nature of her being &s;u&s;pected, are known and acknowledged for characters as critically natural, and as warmly intere&s;ting, as they are ma&s;terly drawn.</P>
<P>Even the &s;ubordinate characters are full of in|tere&s;t. The brave and generous CASSIO, who little &s;u&s;pects any ill effects from the confidence he un|warily places in an in&s;idious villain, is made &s;ub|&s;ervient to the malignant plot again&s;t OTHELLO's peace of mind; in which RODERIGO is the plyant tool that his credulity and vanity completely fit him for; nor is AEMILIA without a con&s;iderable &s;hare of con&s;equence in the groupe; for, without her, the infamous purpo&s;es of her diabolical hu&s;band would not be completed, nor his detection accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, for truth of character, knowledge of hu|man
<PB N="351" REF="356">
nature, intere&s;t, gradually developed and greatly wrought up, that continually varies, occupies, and attracts, and that leaves the mind &s;atisfied, and the judgment convinced, there never has been among all the critics worth notice more than one voice upon the &s;ubject of this play, and the utmo&s;t that has been advanced at all again&s;t it is the infraction of the unities, which it is agreed would have been &s;ufficiently remedied if the &s;cene had been lain in CYPRUS; for my own part, and I believe I am not &s;ingular in my opinion, as the &s;cene of OTHELLO and DESDEMONA before the Senate contains in|tere&s;t and language which has been the delight and wonder of all hearers and readers, I am very well content that the unities in OTHELLO, broken as they are, &s;hould remain as we find them in SHAKESPEAR,</P>
<P>As for the language; I dare not tru&s;t my&s;elf with an examination of it for fear of getting into un|warrantable length. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to know and feel its merit mu&s;t read the whole play, for there is &s;carcely a pa&s;&s;age in it that has not &s;ome remarkable beauty, I &s;hall however be excu&s;ed, perhaps, for noticing a few of the mo&s;t admired &s;cenes.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of the Senate, where OTHELLO de|livers his round unvarni&s;hed tale, is for declamation
<PB N="352" REF="357">
one of the fine&s;t things in the world, which might ea&s;ily be proved by a compari&s;on with the ancients, but that it would be too elaborate for my purpo&s;e. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to make the experiment will when the ta&s;k is accompli&s;hed range on my &s;ide; and to go to the fountain head, for truth, for glow, for &s;trength, for nature, they will not find a cau&s;e &s;o pleaded throughout the whole <HI>Iliad,</HI> admirable as that poem is; and, this admitted, what a glorious thing it would have been for literature had SHAKESPEAR written an epic poem in blank ver&s;e!</P>
<P>SHAKESPEAR in this &s;cene does not blink the que&s;tion, he admits the &s;trange improbability that
<Q><SP>
<L>A maiden never bold,</L>
<L>Of &s;pirit &s;o &s;till and quiet, that her motion</L>
<L>Blu&s;hed at her&s;elf&mdash;</L>
<L>Should fall in love with what &s;he feared to look on.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Thus it is not wonderful BRABANTIO &s;hould conceive that OTHELLO had practi&s;ed witchcraft upon her; but, when with hone&s;t unaffected truth he has related that he won her by an artle&s;s tale of the danger he had pa&s;t which &s;he &s;aid
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"was pitiful, was wonderous pitiful!"</Q>
and the Duke in&s;tantly exclaims
<Q><SP>
<L>I think this tale would win my daughter too,</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="358">With perfect good &s;en&s;e he utters the&s;e words:
<Q><SP>

<L>De&s;truction on my head if my bad blame</L>
<L>Light on the man.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>But when DESDEMONA in mo&s;t unqualified terms confe&s;&s;es that &s;he loves OTHELLO, that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"her heart was &s;ubdued even to the very quality of her lord,"</Q>
that <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"&s;he &s;aw OTHELLO's vi&s;age in his mind,"</Q> and that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"to his honours, and his valiants parts, &s;he con|&s;ecrated her &s;oul, and fortune,"</Q>
no circum&s;tance of objection remains.</P>
<P>This, however, is the foundation of what is to follow. Nothing can get over a degree of capriciou&s;|ne&s;s in the conduct of DESDEMONA, for &s;ays IAGO, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"what delight can &s;he have to look upon the Devil,"</Q> and it is impo&s;&s;ible but a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a di&s;parity between them mu&s;t often occur to OTHELLO; who, though not <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"ea&s;ily jealous,"</Q> by <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"trifles light as air,"</Q> that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"are confirmations &s;trong as proofs of holy writ,"</Q>
is at length <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"perplexed in the extreme."</Q> A pre&s;cience of all this BRABANTIO &s;eems to have had, when he parts from them.<Q><SP>

<L>She has deceived her father, and may thee.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e words are &s;poken in the pre&s;ence not only

of OTHELLO, but IAGO, who afterwards makes a a notable u&s;e of them; and, though OTHELLO an&s;wers

<L>My life upon her faith,</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>Yet that they &s;ink into his mind, and remain latent there, till they come in contact and are called into action by IAGO's arts is evident; for, when IAGO remarks that in her not affecting
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"many propo&s;ed matches of her own clime, complexion and degree, whereto we &s;ee in all things nature tends, one may &s;mell in &s;uch, a will mo&s;t rank, foul di&s;proportion, thoughts unnatural."</Q>
OTHELLO after having &s;truggled with his &s;u&s;picions, exclaims, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Why did I marry?"</Q> So that in this play SHAKES|PEAR has again inculcated that grand le&s;&s;on for hu|man nature, to beware of imprudence.</P>
<P>Never was any thing managed with &s;uch art and nicety as the circum&s;tances which create the jealou&s;y of OTHELLO. SHAKESPEAR knew he had a noble mind to overthrow, and he has managed it by artful, gradual, and natural means. CASSIO is pitched upon by IAGO as the principal tool, to whom RODERIGO and AEMILIA are &s;ubordinate.</P>
<P>CASSIO is noble, generous, brave, and hand|&s;ome. He was privy to the loves of OTHELLO
<PB N="355" REF="360">
and DESDEMONA, and has out&s;tept IAGO in pro|motion. Who then &s;o proper to be the in&s;trument of his intere&s;t, his hatred, and his revenge? But this were not enough, if RODERIGO did not pro|voke him to quarrel, and AEMILIA to &s;teal the handkerchief. Upon the&s;e confirmed facts IAGO ventures to a&s;&s;ert others; till at length the Moor, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"perplexed in the extreme,"</Q> like
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"the ba&s;e Ju|dean throws a pearl away richer than all his tribe."</Q></P>
<P>When he &s;ees CASSIO &s;teal away from DESDE|MONA, out of con&s;cious &s;hame for the fault that he was betrayed into by IAGO, the artful villain ex|claims, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"I like not that!"</Q> And this fir&s;t rou&s;es the &s;u&s;picions of OEHELLO, who is uncon&s;ciou&s;ly from that moment jealous; the quick progre&s;s of which pa&s;&s;ion he &s;trongly feels in his notice that IAGO echoes him.<Q><SP>
<L>By heaven he echoes me!</L>
<L>As if there was &s;ome mon&s;ter in his thought</L>
<L>Too hideous to be &s;hewn. Thou did'&s;t mean &s;omething:</L>
<L>I heard thee &s;ay but now, thou lik'd&s;t not that,</L>
<L>When CASSIO left my wife; what did'&s;t not like?</L>
<L>And, when I told thee he was of my coun&s;el</L>
<L>In my whole cour&s;e of wooing, thou cried'&s;t, Indeed!</L>
<L>And did'&s;t contract and pur&s;e thy brow together,</L>
<L>As if thou had'&s;t &s;hut up in thy brain</L>
<L>Some horrible conceit.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="361">How well, immediately afterwards, does the noble un&s;u&s;pecting nature of OTHELLO bur&s;t forth as he de&s;cribes uncon&s;ciou&s;ly both what IAGO is, and what he thinks him:
<Q><SP>
<L>I know thou art full of hone&s;ty,</L>
<L>And weigh'&s;t thy words before thou giv'&s;t them breath,</L>
<L>Therefore the&s;e &s;tops of thine fright me the more;</L>
<L>For &s;uch things, in a fal&s;e di&s;loyal knave,</L>

<P>IAGO takes this very hint; and, le&s;t he &s;hould be taken for &s;uch a knave, which knave he is though OTHELLO cannot &s;u&s;pect him to be &s;o, he &s;ays, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Perhaps his thoughts are vile,"</Q> that

<P>Wrapt up in his be&s;t &s;ecuritys OTHELLO's good

opinion, he cautions him to beware of jealou&s;y, and having at length &s;et him upon the rack, appears, as if put to the torture him&s;elf, to be wrought upon by his friend&s;hip to a reluctant confe&s;&s;ion of what it was all along his aim to make OTHELLO draw from him. He then opens his pretended &s;u&s;picions, hints his doubts of CASSIO, bids OTHELLO remember, quoting BRABANTIO's words, that DESDEMONA had deceived her father, marrying him; and, when by the&s;e and other infidious arguments, he has &s;hook the whole &s;oul of the brave Moor, he mo&s;t artfully utters with affected &s;implicity and compa&s;&s;ion
<Q><SP>

<Q><SP>
<L>Not a jot, not a jot,</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>The whole &s;cene is wrought up in the &s;ame ma&s;terly manner, till IAGO has made &s;uch an inroad to OTHELLO's heart that it is vulnerable every where, and trifles light as air corrode and burrow in it. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of circum&s;tances, that gra|dually heighten the plot from this moment, are ma|nagement it&s;elf. OTHELLO is confirmed in every thing but the truth. IAGO <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"is a fellow of exceed|ing hone&s;ty,"</Q> and DESDEMONA's to be
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"whi&s;tled

She comes and he exclaims that
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"if &s;he be fal&s;e Heaven mocks it&s;elf!"</Q></P>
<P>Next he is on the rack and vents his fury again&s;t IAGO who at lea&s;t he thinks officious.<Q><SP>
<L>What &s;en&s;e had I of her &s;tollen hours of lu&s;t?</L>
<L>I found not CASSIO's ki&s;&s;es on her lips;</L>
<L>He that is robbed, not knowing what is &s;tolen,</L>
<L>Let him not know it, he's not robbed at all.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P>And again, in de&s;pair,
<Q><SP>
<L>Oh now for ever</L>
<L>Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,</L>
<L>That make ambition virtue!</L>
</SP></Q></P>

<L>To hang a doubt on, or woe upon thy life.</L>
</SP></Q>
<P>In this paroxy&s;m he rages higher and higher, till IAGO, knowing his right cue, undertakes to give him the proof he requires; and the dream, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the handkerchief, work him to &s;uch a pitch that again&s;t CASSIO he exclaims
<Q><SP>
<L>Oh that the &s;lave had forty thou&s;and lives!</L>
<L>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.</L>
</SP></Q></P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="364">This calls up an apo&s;trophe to vengeance, and the conclu&s;ion is that IAGO undertakes the death of CASSIO, and OTHELLO goes apart to furni&s;h him&s;elf

The bu&s;ine&s;s was apparently to make DESDEMONA give CASSIO &s;ome pre&s;ent, and the merit lay in its being a trifle, for any thing of more con&s;equence would have brought on a &s;erious refutation. There is an anecdote which has been told in &s;upport of tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to treat this circum&s;tance lightly. Two Frenchmen were at Drury Lane to &s;ee BARRY in OTHELLO; and, when he &s;poke, in this &s;cene with DESDEMONA, the following words, which he did mo&s;t admirably,
<Q><SP>
<L>There is magic in the web of it;</L>

<P>One of the Frenchmen a&s;ked the other whether he could di&s;|cover what had put the actor in &s;uch an extacy; the other, who ju&s;t under&s;tood Engli&s;h enough to know the circum&s;tance, but not to ta&s;te the application, replied
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Mais, mon Dieu, Mon&s;ieur, il a perdue &s;on mouchoir.</HI>"</Q>
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>Ah, ha,</HI>"</Q> &s;aid the other, with great gravity, <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"<HI>ce'&s;t bien Dommage.</HI>"</Q> Upon &s;pectators as ignorant of the drift of this admirable circum&s;tance as the&s;e Frenchmen it might be thrown away; but, had they known for what purpo&s;e it was introduced, they would have been forward to have acknowledged its propriety for the happie&s;t effects on the French theatre are all produced by trifles light as air.

DESDEMONA a fre&s;h opportunity of &s;oliciting their reconciliation. This he cannot bear. He &s;truggles with the conflict, till, provoked beyond his rea|&s;on, he &s;trikes her.

<P>DESDEMONA's &s;cene with AEMILIA, and after|wards with the inexorable villain IAGO, are beau|tifully tender and irre&s;i&s;tibly melting. Her &s;weet lamentations are exqui&s;ite.

<P><PB N="365" REF="370">There are yet two plays of SHAKESPEAR to be examined, The <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> which appeared in 1612, and <HI>Twelfth Night,</HI> produced in 1614. The fir&s;t is a fre&s;h in&s;tance of the creative fancy of this in|comparable writer, and the other a fair and mo&s;t humourous de&s;cription of natual manners.</P>
<P>Perhaps nothing can be &s;uperior to the great di|ver&s;ity, exten&s;ive variety, the oppo&s;ition of in|telligent to vulgar characters, acriel to earthly, the admirable judgment, the philo&s;ophic grandeur, and the &s;trong ju&s;tice that mark the <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> or the elegant nature, the true humour, the whim&s;ical equivoque, the neat point, the irre&s;i&s;tible plea&s;antry that characterize <HI>Twelfth Night.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> the noble revenge of PROSPERO, the fallen ambition of ALONZO and ANTONIO, and the union of FERDINAND and MIRANDA are &s;trong circum&s;tances, and as greatly treated as they are poetically conceived. The magic is of that kind which in SHAKESPEAR we are impelled to call natural, and the di&s;tinction between the &s;prite ARIEL, and the mon&s;ter CALIBAN, could origina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e from no other mind.

<P><PB N="366" REF="371">As to the language; I could, with much plea|&s;ure, and without any difficulty, get my&s;elf into the &s;ame &s;crape as I did in the examination of <HI>Othello;</HI> but I mu&s;t put a curb on my inclination; not, how|ever, without noticing that from this play the critics have very judiciou&s;ly &s;elected the propere&s;t &s;peech in the works of SHAKESPEAR, or, indeed, in the em|pire of letters, to &s;erve for his epitaph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As I wi&s;h as much that the errors of SHAKESPEAR, when they appear to be material, or have generally been con&s;idered &s;o, &s;hould meet inve&s;tigation, as to have his beauties, were it po&s;&s;ible, enumerated, I think it highly nece&s;&s;ary to notice here the cen&s;ure that has been pa&s;t on his ignorance of nautical terms, as they are ap|plied in this play, which cen&s;ure has been played off as un&s;paringly as ignorantly. I agree that DRYDEN's &s;ea terms are much more correct, and even more poetical than tho&s;e of SHAKESPEAR, and whoever reads his <HI>Annus Mirabiles</HI> mu&s;t acknowledge that he even ex|ceeds in many places the celebrated poem of the <HI>Shipwreck,</HI> by FAL|CONER, not, however, without having run him&s;elf into quaintne&s;s; but navigation was a very different thing at the time of DRYDEN, and of SHAKESPEAR. In that interval we had been taught in great mea&s;ure nautical tactics by the French, which again we had im|proved upon, and I very much que&s;tion whether a young po&s;t captain made at this time, though in every re&s;pect an admirable &s;eaman, would be able to de&s;cribe in what manner &s;ir WALTER RALEIGH manoeuvred a fleet. If this be true it will be extremely difficult to to detect inaccuracy in mere techenical words, which in every pro|fe&s;&s;ion are perpetually varying. We are told that SHAKESPEAR talks of the ma&s;ter's whi&s;tle, although there is a boat&s;wain aboard; but there is not &s;o much impropriety in this upon examination, for as there are different grades in the army, from the en&s;ign to the colonel, and the &s;erjeant to the major, &s;o there are in the navy, from the mid&s;hipman to the admiral, and the under mates of different de&s;criptions to the ma&s;ter; and to prove the immediate connection between the ma&s;ter and the boat&s;wain, the French have no other term for boat&s;wain but <HI>contre-maitre.</HI> Thus the whi&s;tle is effectively the whi&s;tle of the ma&s;ter, &s;ince it is as much u&s;ed by his command as the drum is by the command of the major when he takes out the battalion; and to which we may add that different nations have different modes. The ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion belonged to NAPLES, and tis known that there we find brigantines, &s;chooners, xebecs, bilanders, galliots, and others that go in the catalogue for &s;hips, and that they have different &s;ails and con&s;equently different officers. This ap|parent mi&s;take, therefore, however it might &s;hock the ears of a mid&s;hipman of the pre&s;ent day, might for ought we know to the contrary be both figuratively and literally right at the time of SHAKESPEAR, for the re&s;t of his phra&s;es, though not fa&s;hionable, are ea&s;ily under&s;tood. <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Take in the top&s;ail"</Q> is a very good phra&s;e, e&s;pe|cially as the wind encrea&s;es, and it is a good preparation for <Q REND="inline margQuotes">"down with the topma&s;t,"</Q> which is the next word of command.

<P>With this play, which fini&s;hed the brilliant ca|reer of SHAKESPEAR, I have brought up my ac|count of that a&s;&s;emblage of dramatic talents that ornamented the reign of JAMES the fir&s;t; an era, not|with&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid again&s;t it, which certainly has no parallel, and when we take in the con&s;ideration of the &s;hort time the theatre had eman|cipated from the rude&s;t barbari&s;m and arrived to a degree of perfection it never knew before through|out the world, and which I am afraid it will never know again; and, al&s;o that this perfection was &s;olely and entirely owing to SHAKESPEAR, the proud con|clu&s;ion for the honour of this country is too decided to need an ob&s;ervation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I come to examine the wits of CHARLES the &s;econd, I &s;hall fulfil an unwilling duty by &s;hewing how unju&s;tly SHAKESPEAR and his cotemporaries are a&s;per&s;ed to &s;et off the dramatic writings of that time, when general poetry had certainly advanced into great reputation, but dramatic poetry had proportionably fallen off. DRYDEN, who in this in&s;tance lo&s;t &s;ight of all candour and liberality, caluminated what he could not equal; for he was hardly ever great without rhime, which, however it might have been agreeable to CHARLES the &s;econd, who was ju&s;t arrived from FRANCE, and rapt up in CORNEILLE, and the re&s;t, is not the language of nature; and this proves that it is one thing to be a poet, and another thing to be a dramatic poet.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. PLAYHOUSES AND ACTORS.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE &s;hewn that about &s;eventy plays were pro|duced in the interval between 1589 and 1603. From that time to the death of JAMES the fir&s;t, a period of twenty two years, there were probably about one hundred and ninety pieces brought out which were acknowledged by their authors, and about thirty, of which the authors were concealed, indeed we have accounts of a larger number but I think the remainder, amounting to about twenty-five, were performed between the death of JAMES and the commencement of the troubles of CHARLES the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>We may, however, &s;et down fairly that ten plays, on an average, be&s;ides two, or perhaps three ma&s;ques, in a year, during that period, were pre|&s;ented to the public, and this induces us fully to believe that theatres multiplied very fa&s;t owing to the various contentions of &s;o many authors; but it
<PB N="372" REF="377">
is not, therefore, to be taken for granted that they had all regular companies, or that plays were acted in them all at one time; but rather that they were &s;ome of them &s;ubordinate to the re&s;t, or that the companies of performers &s;hifted about occa&s;ionally to them, as it might from various cau&s;es &s;uit their convenience,</P>
<P>We hear of no regular licence, under the Privy Seal, to any per&s;on or &s;et of per&s;ons except that granted in the fir&s;t year of JAMES, to SHAKESPEAR, FLETCHER, BURBAGE, HEMMINGS, CONDEL, and others, and as this authorized them not only to ex|hibit plays at their u&s;ual hou&s;e the Globe, on the Bank Side, but wherever el&s;e they thought proper, it is po&s;&s;ible, for they were not then encumbered with &s;cenes, that they might perform at different places for the better accommodation of tho&s;e who lived in the vicinities of the re&s;pectives theatres.</P>
<P>We know that SHAKESPEAR's company occu|pied the Globe and Blackfriers, and al&s;o a winter and &s;ummer hou&s;e, at either of which when they per|formed they were called the King's Servants, &s;o that here are four hou&s;es belonginging to one concern. The company at the Phoenix in Drury Lane, were called the Queen's Servants, and the private theatre in Sali&s;bury Court, were called the Prince's Servants,
<PB N="373" REF="378">
but there is nothing that leads us to a knowledge of who the actors were that made up the&s;e two com|panies, whereas almo&s;t the whole of SHAKESPEAR's company are not only known by name but we have already &s;een a good deal of their re&s;pective merits.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ix theatres, the Red Bull, in St. John's Street, and the Fortune, near White Cro&s;s Street, &s;eem to have attracted the principal notice at the time of which we are &s;peaking; the fir&s;t being ap|propriated for the reception of genteel companies, and the latter for citizens and the inferior de&s;crip|tion of per&s;ons. It is po&s;&s;ible the Curtain, and the Theatre, which had been built a great many years before, were at this time &s;hut up, and what induces us to believe this is, that ALLEYN, when he became manager of the Fortune, was obliged to take it down and rebuild it; at which time he is &s;aid to have di&s;|covered that trea&s;ure with which he erected and en|dowed Dulwich Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>This ridiculous report has been credited on no other ground than that it is not ea&s;y, in any rational way, to account for ALLEYN's having ama&s;&s;ed the very large riches he is &s;aid to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which had they amounted to no more than the eight hun|dred a year, the endowment of Dulwich, would have been at that time an immen&s;e fortune for a per&s;on

in his &s;ituation. He is &s;aid to have been an ex|cellent actor, and to have been very &s;ucce&s;sful; but who was at that time &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as SHAKESPEAR? and yet he died in no &s;tate, though the world &s;ub|&s;cribes to his prudence, to keep his family above mediocrity, much le&s;s to build and endow an ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>ALLEYN's fortune no doubt proceeded partly from marrying three wives each of whom brought a hand&s;ome portion, partly from the &s;ucce&s;s of his theatre, partly from his being keeper of the king's wild bea&s;ts and ma&s;ter of the Royal Bear Garden, and partly from his being a mo&s;t rigid and penurious economi&s;t, which character he &s;o &s;trictly enjoined him&s;elf that he was the fir&s;t pen&s;ioner in his own charity; probably in imitation of RAHERE, who founded, as we have &s;een, St. Bartholomew's Priory, in which he became the fir&s;t prior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>However ALLEYN procured his fortune, and whatever were his motive for building his ho&s;pital, he de&s;erves for ever the thanks of his own fraternity for perpetuating a trait that reflects the highe&s;t honour on that profe&s;&s;ion which fools only have con&s;idered as di&s;|honourable. His influence mu&s;t have been very great; for he ob|tained liberty to endow his charity, notwith&s;tanding the repre&s;en|tation of the great Chancellor BACON, who wrote upon this occa&s;ion the following letter to the marquis of BUCKINGHAM.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I now write to give the king an account of a patent I have &s;tayed at the &s;eal: it is of licence to give in mortmain eight hun|dred pound land, though it be of tenure in chief, to ALLEN that was a player, for an ho&s;pital. I like well that ALLEN playeth the la&s;t act of his life &s;o well; but if his maje&s;ty give away thus to amortize his tenures, his court of wards will decay; which I had well hoped &s;hould improve. But that which moved me chiefly, is that his maje&s;ty now lately did ab&s;olutely deny &s;ir HENRY SAVILE for two hundred pounds, and &s;ir EDWARD SANDYS for one hundred pounds, to the perpetuating of two lectures, the one in OXFORD, the other in CAMBRIDGE, foun|dations of &s;ingular honour to his maje&s;ty, and of which there is great want; whereas ho&s;pitals abound, and beggars abound never a whit the le&s;s.

<P><PB N="375" REF="380">The Fortune Theatre did very well but it was only frequented, as we have &s;een, by tho&s;e who could afford to pay low prices; and, in other re&s;pects, could not be in &s;uch repute as tho&s;e places over which SHAKESPEAR pre&s;ided; for none of the plays in great e&s;timation were brought out there but on the contrary they were all performed either at the Globe, or Blackfriers, or at the Phoenix, and as we hear very little of any of the other theatres by which we can de&s;cribe their &s;ucce&s;s and the nature

of their entertainments by any e&s;tabli&s;hed criterion. I do not think it improbable, if they were not u&s;ed occa&s;ionally by the e&s;tabli&s;hed company, that they were either appropriated to the acting of plays for the amu&s;ement of noblemen who kept their re|&s;pective actors, or el&s;e their amu&s;ements con&s;i&s;ted like Sadler's Wells of &s;omething inferior to tho&s;e of the regular theatres, e&s;pecially as Ma&s;ques were &s;o much the fa&s;hion in tho&s;e times.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. CLOSE OF JAMES THE FIRST.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the arts, from the clo&s;e of HENRY the eighth's reign, had been making a progre&s;s towards perfection; though every encouragement was given to genius and talents by ELIZABETH, and to the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible purpo&s;e and effect, as we have &s;een; yet when the kingdom lo&s;t her energy in ruling, many pur&s;uits of ingenuity relaxed.</P>
<P>JAMES, from principle and the prejudice of education, con&s;idered his right to rule as tran&s;mitted from heaven; and, under this abu&s;e of the idea that the king can do no wrong, which is a beautiful fact taken in its right &s;en&s;e, he con&s;idered him&s;elf as in|fallible as a Pope, and thus throughout his whole reign there were con&s;tant &s;truggles between the pri|veleges of the people, and the prerogative of the king.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant religion having drawn a&s;ide that
<PB N="381" REF="386">
veil of &s;uper&s;tition in which mens minds had been entangled, and inveloped, the people began to think for them&s;elves; and, though they were willing to al|low every honour and re&s;pect due to the chief ma|gi&s;trate that had by legitimate right been permitted to rule over them, yet they &s;couted the idea of his being next to a &s;acred mi&s;&s;ionary, and heaven's vicegerent.</P>
<P>The was completely owing to the folly of their ruler. They never dreamt of this with ELIZA|BETH; their obedience to her, though in&s;i&s;ted on, was neither exacted, nor enforced; it was nece&s;&s;ary repre&s;entation on her &s;ide, and whole&s;ome compli|ance on the theirs. Thus her reign being conducted with equal wi&s;dom and re&s;olution, became admired and popular, and &s;he was permitted to po&s;&s;e&s;s pre|rogative to its utmo&s;t &s;tretch, becau&s;e &s;he was not &s;o unwi&s;e as to let it trench on the priveleges of the people.</P>
<P>In this critical juncture, when it required in a &s;overeign &s;trong determination on one &s;ide, and &s;trict impartiality on the other, nothing could be &s;o difficult as to reign in ENGLAND without great, &s;trenuous, and decided talents. The&s;e JAMES un|fortunately did not po&s;&s;e&s;s; he did not even know the character of the people whom he came to go|vern;
<PB N="382" REF="387">
and, &s;eeing this, they were determined to know them&s;elves, and create their own re&s;ources.</P>
<P>This in&s;tantly cleft the kingdom in two, and pri|velege, and prerogative, which, like the right hand and the left were formed for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other, became the &s;ignal of &s;o much &s;chi&s;m and di&s;|union that there can be no doubt but every mea&s;ure during this reign, in which was conceived the no|torious gunpowder plot, in which the upright OVERBURY was poi&s;oned, in which the gallant RA|LEIGH was unju&s;tly executed, and in which the great BACON was ca&s;hiered for bribery, was &s;ome act of preparation for erecting the &s;caffold where the unfortunate CHARLES lo&s;t his head.</P>
<P>Every period, in which a kingdom is involved in di&s;quiet and turbulence, is naturally unfavourable to the arts, and the monarch who neglects the for|tunes of wife and noble coun&s;ellors, accu&s;tomed under his predece&s;&s;ors to de&s;erve, by great and able conduct, the affection and countenance of their fellow &s;ubjects, will never be looked up to as the patron of the ingenious, and the enlightened.</P>
<P>JAMES &s;elected his favourites from low &s;itua|tions. They were weak, ignorant, and illiterate, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed minds congenial to his own. The&s;e
<PB N="383" REF="388">
men were employed to execute mea&s;ures and con|duct expeditions of which they were incapable. Such were ill calculated to encourage merit, and thus it happened that the re&s;t of EUROPE, in general literature, and in many of the arts infinite out&s;tript ENGLAND.</P>
<P>It cannot however be &s;aid that they laid more than dormont. Study was preparing them for that celebrity which patronage was afterwards to con|firm. In the mean time general poetry waited for COWLEY and MILTON, and painting for RUBENS and VANDYKE; mu&s;ic and dramatic poetry were neverthele&s;s in full reputation; and this was owing to the gallantry introduced at court by the king's favourites.</P>
<P>The court of JAMES was full of every &s;pecies of dramatic recreation; an indulgence the people were willing enough to take advantage of; who, while JONSON, invading DANIEL's province, pro|vided tho&s;e &s;uperficial entertainments at court un|der the title of Ma&s;ques, the principal merit of which was owing to the ingenuity of INIGO JONES, followed the more rational pur&s;uits of receiving in|in&s;truction and amu&s;ement from the labours of SHAKESPEAR, and tho&s;e admirable poets who&s;e merits we have already examined.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="389">The&s;e ma&s;ques, however, were particularly fa|vourable to the cau&s;e of mu&s;ic, which, being thus unre&s;trained received, very fa&s;t, particular counte|nance and protection. The great CAMDEN, who&s;e mandate the &s;chools of every de&s;cription were glad enough to obey, had from his infancy made mu&s;ic his favourite &s;tudy, for he was originally a choiri&s;ter at Magdalen College, OXFORD.</P>
<P>CAMDEN, thus partial to mu&s;ic, and determined to give it every advantage in his power made a re|&s;olution to revive a lecture&s;hip at OXFORD that had been founded by ALFRED. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent a mu&s;ical friend, of the name of HEYTHER, with the deed of endowment, for which he had ob|tained permi&s;&s;ion to doctor PIERS, who was then Vice Chancellor, and who was &s;o plea&s;ed with the circum&s;tance, as well as to have an opportunity of obliging CAMDEN, that he obtained the degree of Docor in Mu&s;ic for HEYTHER, and ORLANDO GIBBONS; who were both created by that title on the eigthteenth of May, 1622<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writers in general a&s;&s;ert that GIBBONS never took the de|gree of Doctor in Mu&s;ic; but the following letter from doctor PIERS, the Vice Chancellor, to CAMDEN, will &s;hew that they are completely mi&s;taken.<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The univer&s;ity returns her humble thanks to you with this letter. We pray for your health and long life, that you may &s;ee the fruits of your bounty. We have made Mr. HEYTHER a doctor in mu&s;ic; &s;o that now he is no more ma&s;ter, but Doctor HEYTHER; the like honour for your &s;ake we have conferred upon Mr. ORLANDO GIBBONS, and made him a doctor too, to accompany Dr. HEY|THER. We have paid Mr. Dr. HEYTHER's charges for his jour|ney, and likewi&s;e have given him the OXFORD courte&s;ie, a pair of gloves for him&s;elf, and another for his wife. Your honour is far above all the&s;e things. And &s;o de&s;iring the continuance of your loving favour to the univer&s;ity, and to me your &s;ervant, I take my leave.</P>

<P><PB N="385" REF="390">Be&s;ides the&s;e advantages, which mu&s;ic boa&s;ted from the con&s;equence and the merit of its profe&s;&s;ors, it had every po&s;&s;ible encouragement under the pa|tronage of the great, and the protection of the king, who&s;e children were all in&s;tructed in that art by the able&s;t ma&s;ters. Prince CHARLES was a &s;cholar of COPERARIO, of whom he learnt the viol da gambo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLAYFORD &s;peaks as follows of the mu&s;ical ta&s;te of CHARLES.
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"Nor was his late &s;acred maje&s;ty and ble&s;&s;ed martyr king CHARLES the fir&s;t, behind any of his predece&s;&s;ors in the love and promotion of this &s;cience, e&s;pecially in the &s;ervice of Almighty God, and with much zeal he would hear reverently performed, and often appointed the &s;ervice and anthems him&s;elf, e&s;pecially that &s;harp &s;ervice compo&s;ed by Dr. WILLIAM CHILD, being by his know|ledge in mu&s;ic a competent judge therein; and would play his part exactly well on the ba&s;s-violl, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e incomparable fancies of Mr. COPERARIO to the organ."</Q></NOTE>.
<PB N="386" REF="391">
Prince HENRY al&s;o learnt mu&s;ic, and was a warm patron of mu&s;icians. He had fifteen mu&s;icians on his hou&s;ehold e&s;tabli&s;hment, among whom were doctor BULL, CUTTING<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A good player on the lute was at that time con&s;idered as a great acqui&s;ition. The fame of CUTTING reached to the ears of CHRISTIAN the fourth, king of Denmark; who, having been for&s;aken by DOULAND whom he had invited to his court after hearing him in England, felt him&s;elf &s;o di&s;graced at being without a good luteni&s;t that he entreated lady ARABELLA STUART, in who&s;e &s;ervice CUT|TING was, before he was retained by HENRY, to &s;pare him that celebrated performer. There were &s;ome letters, which are among the Harleian collection, that pa&s;&s;ed upon the occa&s;ion; and, after a great deal of ceremony and con&s;ultation, the lute player went to fill up this cha&s;m in CHRISTIAN's court. He, however, liked the &s;ituation no better than DOULAND had; for, in a very few years afterwards, we find him in the &s;ervice of Prince HENRY.</NOTE>, the famous luteni&s;t, JONES, and ANGELO.</P>
<P>It does not appear, however, that &s;acred mu&s;ic was &s;o much encouraged at that time as familiar and light airs, particularly &s;uch as promoted dancing; an amu&s;ement in which JAMES &s;o delighted that he was more anxious for his children to learn it than any thing in the world. There is extant a letter to his &s;ons where he enjoins them to keep up their dancing, even though they &s;hould be obliged to whi&s;tle and &s;ing to one another for mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>This ta&s;te, however, did &s;ervice to the cau&s;e of
<PB N="387" REF="392">
mu&s;ic, for it accu&s;tomed the ear to familiar melody, that required only to be methodized by LAWES and PURCELL to &s;tamp it with that character which is known by the term true Engli&s;h mu&s;ic; a &s;pecies of &s;ound that &s;o effects the mind, and &s;o appeals to the heart, that the meane&s;t hearer, with feeling and &s;en&s;ibility, will be as capable of ta&s;ting its beauty and deciding upon its merit as the mo&s;t learned critic.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means public amu&s;ements became a matter of &s;ingular con&s;equence. The people tired of fruitle&s;s controver&s;y, were glad enough to ta&s;te &s;o rational a relaxation as the theatre afforded them; and JAMES, by &s;hews and &s;pectacles, hugged him|&s;elf under an idea that he was hiding his own frivo|lous folly, ingratiating him&s;elf with his nobles, and throwing out a tub to the popular whale.</P>
<P>Thus animo&s;ity and mutual recrimination were laughed off and forgotten, through the medium of a comedy or a ma&s;que; and, while the people con|tented them&s;elves with adopting mode&s;t yet manly means to &s;upport their own privileges, the court was &s;o full of fanta&s;tic &s;ports and romantic diver&s;ions that it at length actually became like an enchanted ca&s;tle, whence CHARLES, as a knight, and BUCK|INGHAM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the famous BUCKINGHAM who was afterwards a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inated by FELTON. His conduct in Spain was &s;tark madne&s;s; and if he had wi&s;hed to create the eternal enmity of that nation to his royal ma&s;ter, he could not have managed it more adroitly. Be|&s;ides adventures, intrigues, &s;erenades, duels, and every other in&s;ult likely to exa&s;perate &s;o jealous and &s;o grave a people, nothing could &s;atisfy him but making open love to the duche&s;s of OLIVAREZ, and affronting her hu&s;band. The match was in con&s;equence broken off, and it was a great proof of the good &s;en&s;e and moderation of the Spani&s;h court that they required no &s;erious retribution.</NOTE>, <PB N="388" REF="393">
as his &s;quire, &s;allied forth to gain the affections of a Prince&s;s at the court of SPAIN; but CHARLES having fallen in love with the Prince&s;s HENRIETTA of FRANCE, whom he afterwards mar|ried, and who did &s;o much injury to this country by in&s;tilling the principles of popery into her children, they overturned their whole &s;cheme and came home in di&s;grace.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the imbecility of the king of ENGLAND was at lea&s;t matched by that of the king of FRANCE. The great HENRY had &s;carcely been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by RAVILIAC<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tue conduct of DAUBIGNY &s;eems to have been very doubtful in this bu&s;ine&s;s; who, when confronted by RAVILIAC denied hav|ing had any conver&s;ation with him. Indeed it appears by many circum&s;tances, particularly the fal&s;e and contradictory accounts the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in gave of tho&s;e things that were &s;ound in his pocket, that he was a dupe to the Je&s;uits, on who&s;e ab&s;olution probably he relied; and, for one very &s;trong circum&s;tance to prove that he had accom|plices, the Provo&s;t of PLUVIERS had openly declared, at &s;ix miles di&s;tance from PARIS, on the day the murder happened,
<Q REND="inline margQuotes">"This day the king will be either &s;lain, or dangerou&s;ly wounded."</Q>
He was on this account &s;ent pri&s;oner to PARIS; but, before he could be ex|amined, he hanged him&s;elf.</NOTE>&mdash;which murder, in the
<PB N="389" REF="394">
opinion of many hi&s;torians, notwith&s;tanding he confe&s;&s;ed nothing, was committed either at the in|&s;tance of &s;ome of the nobles, who envied the vir|tues of HENRY, or by the emi&s;&s;aries of SPAIN&mdash;when the duke of SULLY re&s;igned, and the queen regent gave the government of the kingdom into the hands of an Italian chambermaid, who&s;e hu&s;|band. CONCHINI, &s;oon afterwards created Mar&s;hal d'ANCRE, was pre&s;ently made the victim to her ab|&s;urd and unbecoming ambition; for, as &s;oon as the king a&s;&s;umed the government, which he did at the age of fourteen, fir&s;t having married ANNE of AUSTRIA, fearing that, as the power of this man had been derived from one a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, he might wi&s;h to encrea&s;e it by another, employed VITRY, who was afterwards made Mar&s;hal of FRANCE to di&s;po&s;e of his enemy; he was murdered by hire|lings, and his limbs given up to the fury of that populace who were but too ju&s;tly incen&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate was the court of LOUIS; a monarch,
<PB N="390" REF="395">
timid, weak and illiterate, when CHARLES married the prince&s;s HENRIETTA, for though RICHLIEU, then bi&s;hop of LUCON, had reconciled the king and his mother, and began to imagine all tho&s;e advan|tages for the kingdom which were &s;o well planned and carried into execution afterwards, yet nothing but &s;en&s;ele&s;s folly and fanta&s;tic intriguing, cha|racterized court manners.</P>
<P>We have &s;een RICHELIEU a great dramatic pa|tron, and this fancy might, perhaps, have ari&s;en from the nece&s;&s;ity, at the time of LOUIS the thirteenth, of giving into &s;ome weakne&s;&s;es in order to get hold of more &s;ub&s;tantial power. Children cannot be cured entirely by &s;everity. But it is curious that he, who originally merely permitted lighter amu&s;ements, &s;hould at length grow &s;o inordinately fond of them as to admire them more than any other pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>It had been the fa&s;hion to dedicate dramatic pieces; and TROTEREL, BERTRAND, FAUCO|NIER, De la GRANGE, and many others, in&s;ignifi|cant writers by the bye, had already cho&s;en their &s;eperate protectors, not forgetting BILLARD who wrote a tragedy called <HI>Henri le Grand,</HI> which he dedicated to the queen regent.</P>
<P>Thus did the two courts vie with each other in
<PB N="391" REF="396">
dramatic amu&s;ements; and this is the moment to prove, which may be done in a few words, that the celebrity of the ENGLISH &s;tage, for celebrity &s;urely is more legitimately due to intrin&s;ic merit than to &s;hew and &s;pectacle, was as decidedly &s;uperior to that of FRANCE as an animal is to a vegetable, or a piece of mechani&s;m. One had pa&s;&s;ive life, the other active. One was wound up and &s;et a going, the other went of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>A reperu&s;al of the fifth number of this work will confirm this fact, for we &s;hall there find that, except JODELLE, GARNIER, and HARDI, the French &s;tage had boa&s;ted no name of celebrity before COR|NEILLE, who&s;e fir&s;t play, <HI>Melite,</HI> came out in the very year in which JAMES the fir&s;t died.</P>
<P>This proves that the emancipation of the En|gli&s;h from tho&s;e mi&s;ts of opinion which had begun and been encouraged in the reign of ELIZABETH, and had gradually &s;trengthened and been confirmed throughout the life of JAMES, yielded mo&s;t rati|onally to the be&s;t relaxation that could recreate the fancy, without injury to the mind; and this &s;olid &s;en&s;e, and found judgment, taught them to cheri&s;h in SHAKESPEAR the greate&s;t genius the world has produced; for, in the mid&s;t of the &s;quabbles and bickerings during his life, in which there is nothing
<PB N="392" REF="397">
arrogant, bold, or a&s;piring, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that ad|miration he never courted, and received every te&s;ti|mony of grateful re&s;pect from his fellow creatures, whom he had taught and delighted. Not the leader of a party, or the minion of a court, but the advo|cate of virtue, and the favourite of human nature.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e premi&s;es I gather this conclu&s;ion. That, as the meritorious labours of the drama re|ceived very little &s;upport but from the people, as the &s;tage had not known the great variety of ad|vantages introduced to it afterwards, as all the col|lateral arts were in a &s;upine &s;tate; and, in &s;hort, as it was obliged to &s;tand or fall by its own intrin&s;ic and individual merit; the number of admirable tragedies and comedies that were produced at that time, for the&s;e are its true criterion, give dramatic fame, be|yond calculation, a decided &s;uperiority over every thing it ever boa&s;ted, either before, or &s;ince.</P>
