<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAving recommended this Play to the Town, and delivered the Copy of it to the Book&s;eller, I think my &s;elf oblig'd to give &s;ome Account of it.</P>
<P>It had been &s;ome Years in the Hands of the Author, and falling under my Peru&s;al, I thought &s;o well of it that I per&s;uaded him to make a few Additions and Alterations to it, and let it appear upon the Stage. I own I was very highly plea&s;ed with it, and lik'd it the better, for the want of tho&s;e &s;tudyed Similes and Repartees, which we, who have writ before him, have thrown into our Plays, to indulge and gain upon a fal&s;e Ta&s;te that has prevailed for many Years in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Theatre. I believe the Au|thor would have fallen into this Way a little more than he has, had he, before the writing of it, been often pre&s;ent at Theatrical Repre&s;entations, and ob&s;erv'd the Effect that &s;uch Ornaments generally have upon the Town. I was confirmed in my Thoughts of the Play, by the Opi|nion of better Judges to whom it was Communicated, who ob&s;erved that the Scenes were written very much after <HI>Moliere</HI>'s Manner, and that an ea&s;ie and natural Vein of Humour ran through the whole.</P>
<P>I do not que&s;tion but the Reader will di&s;cover this, and &s;ee many Beauties that e&s;cape the Audience; the Tou|ches
<PB REF="5">
being too delicate for every Ta&s;te in a Popular A&s;|&s;embly. My Brother-Sharers were of Opinion, at the fir&s;t reading of it, that it was like a Picture in which the Strokes were not &s;trong enough to appear with Advan|tage at a Di&s;tance. As it is not in the common way of Writing, the Approbation was at fir&s;t Doubtful, but has ri&s;en every time it has been Acted, and has given an Opportunity in &s;everal of its Parts for as ju&s;t and good Action as I ever &s;aw on the Stage.</P>
<P>The Reader will con&s;ider that I &s;peak here as the Pa|tentee, for which Rea&s;on I forbear being more particular in the Character of this Play, lea&s;t I &s;hould appear like one, who cries up the Wares of his own Shop to draw in Cu&s;tomers.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE came another Coach to Town la&s;t Night, that brought a Gentleman to enquire about this &s;trange Noi&s;e, we hear in the Hou&s;e. This Spirit will bring a power of Cu&s;tom to the <HI>George</HI>&mdash;If &s;o be he continues his Pranks, I de&s;ign to &s;ell a Pot of Ale, and &s;et up the Sign of the Drum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll give Madam warning, that's flat&mdash;I've always liv'd in Sober Families. I'll not di&s;parage my &s;elf to be a Servant in a Hou&s;e that is haunted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll e'en marry <HI>Nell,</HI> and rent a bit of Ground of my own, if both of you leave Madam; not but that Madam's a very good Woman&mdash;if Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> did not &s;poil her&mdash;come, here's her Health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a very hard thing to be a Butler in a Hou&s;e, that is di&s;turb'd. He made &s;uch a Racket in the Cellar la&s;t Night, that I'm afraid he'll &s;ower all the Beer in my Barrels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, <HI>John,</HI> we ought to take it off as fa&s;t as we can. Here's to you&mdash;He rattled &s;o loud under the Tiles la&s;t Night, that I verily thought the Hou&s;e wou'd have fallen over our Heads. I dur&s;t not go up into the Cock-Loft this Morning, if I had not got one of the Maids to go along with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought I heard him in one of my Bed-Po&s;ts&mdash;I marvel, <HI>John,</HI> how he gets into the Hou&s;e when all the Gates are &s;hut.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look ye <HI>Peter,</HI> your Spirit will creep you into an Augre-Hole:&mdash;he'll whisk ye through a Key-Hole, without &s;o much as ju&s;tling again&s;t one of the Wards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Madam is mainly frighted that's certain, and ve|rily believes 'tis my Ma&s;ter that was kill'd in the la&s;t Campaign.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out of all manner of Que&s;tion, <HI>Robin,</HI> 'tis Sir <HI>George.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Abigal</HI> is of Opinion it can be none but his Honour; he always lov'd the Wars, and you know was mightily pleas'd from a Child with the Mu&s;ick of a Drum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder his Body was never found after the Battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Found! Why, ye Fool, is not his Body here about the Hou&s;e? Do&s;t thou think he can beat his Drum without Hands and Arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis Ma&s;ter as &s;ure as I &s;tand here alive, and I verily believe I &s;aw him la&s;t Night in the Town-Clo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! how did he appear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like a White-Hor&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pho, <HI>Robin,</HI> I tell ye he has never appear'd yet but in the Shape of the Sound of a Drum,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>This makes one almo&s;t afraid of one's own Shadow. As I was walking from the Stable t'other Night without my Lan|thorn, I fell a-cro&s;s a Beam, that lay in my way, and Faith my Heart was in my Mouth&mdash;I thought I had &s;tumbled over a Spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou might'&s;t as well have &s;tumbled over a Straw; why, a Spirit is &s;uch a little little Thing, that I have heard a Man, who was a great Scholar, &s;ay, that he'll dance ye a <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Horn-Pipe upon the point of a Needle&mdash;As I &s;at in the Pantry la&s;t Night counting my Spoons, the Candle methought burnt blue, and the &s;pay'd Bitch look'd as if &s;he &s;aw &s;omething.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay poor Cur, &s;he's almo&s;t frighten'd out of her Wits.</P>
</SP>

<P>My Lady mu&s;t have him Laid, that's certain, whatever it co&s;t her.</P>

<P>Pugh, this is all froth! you under&s;tand nothing of the Matter&mdash;the next time it makes a Noi&s;e, I tell you what ought to be done,&mdash;I wou'd have the Steward &s;peak Latin to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay that wou'd do, if the Steward had but Courage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you have it&mdash;He's a fearful Man. If I had as much Learning as he, and I met the Gho&s;t, I'd tell him his own! but alack what can one of us poor Men do with a Spirit, that can neither Write nor Read?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art always cracking and boa&s;ting, <HI>Peter,</HI> thou do&s;t not know what Mi&s;chief it might do thee, if &s;uch a &s;illy Dog as thee &s;hould offer to &s;peak to it. For ought I know, he might flea thee alive, and make Parchment of thy Skin to cover his Drum with.</P>

<P>I verily believe thee, keep thy Temper, <HI>Peter</HI>; after Supper we'll drink each of us a double Mug, and then let come what will.</P>

<P>Why wilt thou needs have it to be my Husband? he never had any rea&s;on to be offended at me. I always lov'd him while he was living, and &s;hou'd prefer him to any Man, were he &s;o &s;till.

<P>That's a likely matter indeed; did you ever hear of a Wo|man who had Power over a Man, when &s;he was his Wife, that had none while &s;he was his Mi&s;tre&s;s! Oh! there's nothing in the World improves a Man in his Complai&s;ance like Mar|riage!</P>

<SPEAKER>Vel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, my good Ma&s;ter, I am as much rejoiced to &s;ee you alive, as I was upon the Day you were born. Your Name was, in all the News-Papers, in the Li&s;t of tho&s;e that were &s;lain.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir G.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have not Time to be particular. I &s;hall only tell thee in general, that I was taken Pri&s;oner in the Battle, and was under clo&s;e Confinement for &s;everal Months. Upon my Relea&s;e, I was re&s;olv'd to &s;urprize my Wife with the News of my being alive. I know, <HI>Vellum,</HI> you are a Per&s;on of &s;o much Penetration, that I need not u&s;e any further Arguments to con|vince you that I am &s;o:</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm only afraid &s;he &s;hou'd be convinc'd of it to her Sorrow. Is not &s;he pleas'd with her imaginary Widowhood? Tell me truly, was &s;he afflicted at the Report of my Death?</P>
</SP>

<P>Women who have been happy in a fir&s;t Marriage, are the mo&s;t apt to venture upon a &s;econd. But for my part, I had a Husband &s;o every way &s;uited to my Inclinations, that I mu&s;t entirely forget him, before I can like another Man. I have now been a Widow but fourteen Months, and have had twice as many Lovers, all of 'em profe&s;t Admirers of my Per&s;on, but pa&s;&s;ionately in love with my Jointure. I think it is a Revenge I owe my Sex to make an Example of this worthle&s;s Tribe of Fellows, who grow impudent, dre&s;s them&s;elves fine, and fancy we are oblig'd to provide for 'em. But of all my Captives, Mr. <HI>Tin&s;el</HI> is the mo&s;t extraordinary in his kind. I hope the Diver&s;ion I give my &s;elf with him is unblameable. I'm &s;ure 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to turn my Thoughts off from the Memory of that dear Man, who has been the greate&s;t Happine&s;s and Affliction of my Life.

<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay marry that's good News indeed; But where is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>He's lock'd up with the Steward in his Office, they are laying their Heads together very clo&s;e. I fancy they are ca&s;ting a Figure.</P>

<P>Prithee <HI>John,</HI> what &s;ort of a Creature is a Conjurer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he's made much as other Men are, if it was not for his long grey Beard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye <HI>Peter,</HI> it &s;tands with rea&s;on, that a Conjurer &s;hou'd have a long grey Beard&mdash;for did ye ever know a Witch that was not an Old Woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="29">
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why! I remember a Conjurer once at a Fayr, that to my thinking was a very Smock-fac'd Man, and yet he &s;pew'd out fifty Yards of green Ferret. I fancy, <HI>John,</HI> if thou'd&s;t get him into the Pantry and give him a Cup of Ale, he'd &s;hew us a few Tricks. Do'&s;t think we cou'd not per&s;uade him to &s;wallow one of thy Ca&s;e-Knives for his Diver&s;ion? He'll certainly bring it up again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Peter</HI>! thou art &s;uch a Wi&s;e-acre! Thou do'&s;t not know the Difference between a Conjurer and a Jugler. This Man mu&s;t be a very great Ma&s;ter of his Trade. His Beard is at lea&s;t half a Yard long, he's dre&s;s'd in a &s;trange dark Cloak, as black as a Cole, your Conjurer always goes in Mourning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is he a Gentleman, had he a Sword by his Side?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he's too grave a Man for that, a Conjurer is as grave as a Judge,&mdash;but he had a long white Wand in his Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may be &s;ure there's a good deal of Vertue in that Wand&mdash;I fancy 'tis made out of Witch Elm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant you if the Gho&s;t appears, he'll whisk ye that Wand before his Eyes, and &s;trike you the Drum-&s;tick out of his Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; the Wand, look ye, is to make a Circle, and if he once gets the Gho&s;t in a Circle, then he has him&mdash;let him get out again if he can. A Circle, you mu&s;t know, is a Conjurer's Trap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what will he do with him, when he has him there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then he'll overpower him with his Learning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he can once compa&s;s him, and get him in Lobs-Pound, he'll make nothing of him, but &s;peak a few hard Words to him, and perhaps bind him over to his good Behaviour, for a Thou|&s;and Years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, hell &s;end him packing to his Grave again with a Flea in his Ear, I warrant him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>But.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I wou'd advi&s;e Madam to &s;pare no Co&s;t. If the Conjurer be but well paid, he'll take pains upon the Gho&s;t, and lay him, look ye, in the Red-Sea&mdash;and then he's laid for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay marry, that wou'd &s;poil his Drum for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="23" REF="30">
<SPEAKER>Gard.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>John,</HI> there mu&s;t be a power of Spirits in that &s;ame Red-Sea&mdash;I warrant ye they are as plenty as Fi&s;h.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Coach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I wi&s;h after all that he may not be too hard for the Conjurer; I'm afraid he'll find a tough bit of work on't.</P>

<P>I wi&s;h the Spirit may not carry a Corner of the Hou&s;e off with him.</P>
