<HEAD>INTRODUCTION TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Author of this Poem had begun one, on the Subject, many Years ago: but, doubting whether in the Plan he was proceeding on he had enough expre&s;s'd the Sen&s;e of one who had the Ble&s;&s;ing to be born and educated in a Land of <HI>Liberty,</HI> he had Di&s;cretion to &s;top &s;hort: and has po&s;tpon'd its Publication, for above three Times the Space pre&s;crib'd by <HI>Horace</HI> for impartial Re-examination of a Poet's fir&s;t Conceptions.&mdash;He now finds, from the Re&s;ult of this Deliberation, that, tho' his General Purpo&s;e then was right, as but preferring the <HI>Monarchic,</HI> to the <HI>Popular</HI> Forms of Government; yet, had he, at That Time, gone through his Work, He was in Danger to have <HI>err'd,</HI> in one particular Point, of mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Con&s;equence: re&s;training Monarchy to its <HI>too &s;imple Species</HI>&mdash;where It verges to, and looks like, Tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="4">Early Prejudices are imbib'd too deeply to be rooted out at once. Experience, and Reflection, have, &s;ince, taught him, to <HI>conjoin,</HI> Ideas, which, before, &s;eem'd <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent:</HI> and to know and own, as he now does, that Monarchy is there mo&s;t nobly con&s;tituted, where Crowns inve&s;t their Wearers with the mo&s;t exten&s;ive Power to <HI>guard,</HI> the Public Liberty: without Inducement to expect Increa&s;e of Happine&s;s, or Glory, from Attempts to <HI>violate</HI> it.</P>
<P>There is <HI>That</HI> Difference, and no other, between the fir&s;t, and pre&s;ent, Purpo&s;e of the Poem.&mdash;The Fabric is the &s;ame, as formerly: but It has firmer Ground, for its Foundation. &mdash;The <HI>Hebrew Sy&s;tem</HI> is, and mu&s;t be, <HI>Monarchy:</HI> but It is <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Monarchy, as GOD may be &s;uppos'd, without Affront to his be&s;t Attributes, to have e&s;tabli&s;h'd at the Head of a <HI>Free</HI> People: whom he would not, by a Wa&s;te of <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> Miracles, have brought up out of Slavery to an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Tyrant; to have left 'em <HI>Slaves again,</HI> in a wor&s;e Country, under Tyrants, of their own Fraternity.</P>
<P>The Plan, as it now &s;tands, is &s;trictly con&s;onant to This Idea: And &s;o little Difference could ari&s;e from the mi&s;taken <HI>Species,</HI> where the <HI>Genus</HI> was <HI>monarchical,</HI> that almo&s;t every thing, in the <HI>Poetic</HI> View, retains its Place, as in its fir&s;t Production: with Exception only to That nobler Ta&s;te of <HI>Freedom</HI>; which the Writer ow'd to a di&s;intere&s;ted, &s;ilent, and &s;incere Attachment, never confe&s;s'd, till now, to the uncon&s;cious Object of it. Here, fir&s;t, and much too late, his touch'd Heart call'd upon him to record the Obligation.</P>
<P>It has been thought advi&s;able to publi&s;h only Three Books at a Time: and with the fir&s;t the Notes belonging to it. Partly by way of Specimen: but chiefly becau&s;e relative to the De&s;ign, and general Con&s;titution, of the <HI>Epic Species.</HI> &mdash;The Notes to All the Books, will, la&s;t, be publi&s;h'd, by
<PB N="7" REF="5">
Them&s;elves: and may be bound di&s;tinct from the Poetic Part: or be annex'd to Each Book relatively; making, &s;o, <HI>Two</HI> Volumes; at Election of the Reader: who may al&s;o, in this Method, chu&s;e to take, or leave, the <HI>Notes,</HI> at his own Plea&s;ure.&mdash;The Remaining Three Parts, of the Poem, will be publi&s;h'd in like manner as This Fir&s;t: and at the &s;horte&s;t Di&s;tances which can con&s;i&s;t with Care, in the Revi|&s;al and Correction of &s;o large a Work, and where Variety of Subjects claim the clo&s;e&s;t Application, of a Writer, not in|&s;en&s;ible with what a Reverence Men &s;hould appear before the Public Eye; who dare a&s;pire to being held in View, be|yond the Dimne&s;s of a pre&s;ent Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>He pre&s;umes to call his pre&s;ent Pro&s;pect but a <HI>dim</HI> one, without Arrogance, or Satire: being equally remote from dreaming too <HI>&s;ublimely,</HI> or too <HI>de&s;picably,</HI> of the Age and Nation he was doom'd to take his Fate in.&mdash;He, but too well, knows 'em not the be&s;t di&s;pos'd, in any Kind, for <HI>giving Fame to Epic Poetry:</HI> yet, mu&s;t prote&s;t again&s;t &s;o far misjudging his Cotemporaries as to &s;u&s;pect it po&s;&s;ible, that many &s;hould not now be living, as completely qualify'd, as in whatever other Time, or Country, to know how far a Poet has de&s;erv'd their Notice: and refu&s;e it only, where It ought not to be granted.</P>
<P>For the Re&s;t, he ca&s;ts his Hopes upon <HI>Futurity:</HI> and, having but a &s;hort Re&s;erve of per&s;onal Claim to <HI>Time,</HI> tran&s;|fers his Expectation of Survival, to this Child of Lei&s;ure, His <HI>Poetic Repre&s;entative.</HI></P>
<P>He has nothing further, here, to add, concerning it, the <HI>Notes</HI> being very circum&s;tantial, and explanatory: only, that the Work (which is of <HI>Epic,</HI> or <HI>Heroic,</HI> Species), had for Object, the chief Virtues of a People: <HI>Intrepidity,</HI> in foreign <HI>War</HI>&mdash;and Spirit of dome&s;tic <HI>Liberty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="6">As for the <HI>Notes,</HI> they are not merely of <HI>poetical,</HI> or <HI>critical,</HI> Intention: but con&s;i&s;t, occa&s;ionally, of enlarg'd Di&s;cour&s;es upon different Subjects, drawn from old and modern <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>; to elucidate and give Examples, to, <HI>poli|tical</HI> Deductions, which ari&s;e from <HI>Incidents,</HI> remark'd upon. They are, al&s;o, <HI>Military, Geographic,</HI> and <HI>Commercial:</HI> and include Variety of other Subjects: as the Reader will di&s;|cover in their Progre&s;s.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e Reflections, it may po&s;&s;ibly give Satisfaction to the Learn'd and Reverend Body of our <HI>Clergy,</HI> in par|ticular, to &s;ee the following three Points touch'd, in the new Lights here given them.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, That the fine <HI>Theocracy,</HI> of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> In&s;titution, was de&s;troy'd, in its Progre&s;&s;ion, but by natural Con&s;equence of one political Defect (that has not been enough adverted to, by Writers on that Subject), <HI>the Military Care disjoin'd from the Imperial.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly, That the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Form of Government was never, as it has by Mr. <HI>Harrington</HI> (and almo&s;t generally) been &s;up|pos'd, <HI>a Popular Republic:</HI> but a plain <HI>Hereditary Monar|chy:</HI> the &s;overeign Power whereof was ve&s;ted in the <HI>High-Prie&s;t</HI>'s Per&s;on.</P>
<P>And 3dly, That, with Exception only to this la&s;t <HI>peculiar</HI> Circum&s;tance, there ari&s;e great Probabilities, toward finding in the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd <HI>Hebrew Model,</HI> the Original of All the manly <HI>Celtic Forms:</HI> and, in particular, of That, which con&s;titutes the <HI>pre&s;ent Sy&s;tem in Great Britain</HI>;&mdash;not relax|ing from its, known, &s;ound Principles.</P>
<P>Thus much &s;eem'd needful to premi&s;e. What re&s;ts, will follow, with the <HI>Notes,</HI> conjunctively: Tho&s;e on the fir&s;t Book being publi&s;h'd previou&s;ly, becau&s;e explanatory of the <HI>General</HI> Purpo&s;e.</P>

It requires great Images, and yet a greater Wit to form them.&mdash;Finally, there mu&s;t be a Judgment &s;o &s;olid, a Di&s;cernment &s;o exqui&s;ite, &s;uch perfect Knowlege of the Language, in which he writes, &s;uch ob&s;tinate Study, profound Meditation, and va&s;t Capacity, that &s;carce whole Ages can produce One Genius fit for an <HI>Epic Poem.</HI> And it is an Enterprize &s;o bold, that it cannot fall into a wi&s;e Man's Thoughts but it mu&s;t affright him.</Q></P>
<P>By this Time, it grows needful, that I ha&s;ten to cry out, and own, that the mo&s;t <HI>vain,</HI> and empty Wretch in Nature, would be &s;uch a <HI>Poet</HI> as, conceiving the tenth Part of the&s;e prodigious Difficulties in his Way, which the <HI>French</HI> Critic had, by overheating his Imagination, taught him&s;elf to think were really there, &s;hould, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch Belief, have Arrogance enough to undertake a Work, &s;o terribly beyond his Compa&s;s!&mdash;under which nece&s;&s;ary Shield of hone&s;t Truth, I will dare venture yet a little farther,&mdash;into what our own Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> has declar'd on the &s;ame Subject.</P>
<P><Q>I am apt (&s;ays he, in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay</HI> upon the Art we are con&s;idering) to believe &s;o much, of the Genius of Poetry, and of its Elevation, in <HI>Homer</HI>'s and <HI>Virgil</HI>'s EPIC Works, that I know not, whether, of all the Numbers of Mankind, who live within the Compa&s;s of a thou&s;and Years, for One Man that is born, capable of making &s;uch a Poet, there may not be a thou&s;and born,
<PB N="39" REF="47">
capable of making as Great Generals of Armies, or Mini&s;ters of State, as any the mo&s;t renown'd in Story.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Caveats,</HI> &s;o high-&s;trained as The&s;e, have made it nece&s;&s;ary for an Epic Un|dertaker to &s;ay &s;omething, That may ju&s;tify his Mode&s;ty. A Definition of it, therefore, in the humbler Light I &s;ee it by, may hope to &s;hew it a le&s;s arduous Adventure; and demon&s;trate, that the Difficulty, however certainly con&s;iderable, is by no means &s;o in&s;uperable, as The&s;e Gentlemen appear to think it. Critical Sy&s;tems reconcile two contradictory Extremes: and are, at once, too <HI>va&s;t,</HI> and too <HI>re&s;trictive.</HI> The Cau&s;e is, they lean with a too partial Bia&s;s, toward a few Great Names: to who&s;e Example they would chain down Nature.</P>
<P>Many Friends of Fancy, on the other Side, mi&s;take for Epic Poems, any Story, told in Ver&s;e, containing a wild Series of Romantic Incidents, related of &s;ome Hero, whom the Piece takes Name from. But there are &s;carce two Things in Nature, which more widely differ, than the&s;e Hi&s;tories in Ver&s;e, from <HI>Epic Poetry.</HI>&mdash;I wi&s;h I could have &s;atisfied my&s;elf with <HI>Bo&s;&s;u</HI>'s Definition: It had &s;av'd me the Pre&s;umption of attempting one, my&s;elf. But <HI>His</HI> appearing to be neither <HI>full,</HI> nor <HI>clear</HI>; and having never &s;een a better; I am forc'd on the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of hazarding a new one, of my own; which will, I fear, be, &s;till, de|fective.</P>
<P>I take an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> then, to mean &s;ome noble Le&s;&s;on in Morality, delivered under Colour of <HI>One Action,</HI> which mu&s;t be illu&s;trious and important, in It&s;elf, and in its Per&s;onages, intere&s;t &s;upernatural Powers in its Succe&s;&s;es, and be pro|bably, delightfully, and &s;urpri&s;ingly de&s;cribed, in Ver&s;e; with ornamental <HI>Epi|&s;odic Parts,</HI> depending on, and ri&s;ing naturally out of the main Tendency. Throughout all which the Poet keeps no view before him, but to &s;trengthen, by Example, That one moral Le&s;&s;on, he propo&s;es to imprint, upon his Reader's Admiration.</P>
<P>To explain This Definition, by enlarging its Particulars.&mdash;A Man, who un|dertakes an <HI>Epic Poem,</HI> is not to write a <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI>; but to propagate a <HI>Moral. Homer,</HI> for Example, had conceiv'd &s;uch Purpo&s;e.&mdash;It was not his De&s;ign to write the <HI>Fall</HI> of <HI>Troy</HI>; That Story was already known; and could have brought no Novelty, but in the Plea&s;ure of the Ver&s;es.&mdash;Plea&s;ure was not his chief End: He aim'd to give <HI>Advice.</HI> His Pro&s;pect was, to teach the <HI>Greeks,</HI> &s;plit into little independent States, that <HI>Union could recover Victory, when Di&s;cord had transferr'd it to an Enemy.</HI> The <HI>Grecian's</HI> Triumph over <HI>Troy</HI> was then di&s;|cours'd of with much Vanity, through all their inconfederate Divi&s;ions. <HI>Homer</HI> ob&s;erv'd this Sen&s;e of <HI>General Glory,</HI> and deriv'd a Story from it, that would be&s;t enforce the Moral, he prepar'd to teach 'em: borrowing Names, and Incidents from that remember'd, and high-boa&s;ted War; but giving 'em a new, and proper Turn, for the Conveyance of his Moral only.&mdash;Had <HI>Homer</HI> not been born, till <HI>Alexander</HI> had made <HI>Greece</HI> one Monarchy, the Moral he would then have cho&s;en had been the <HI>pro&s;perous Effect of Power in one wi&s;e, and brave Man's Hand: and what &s;ure Benefits accrue from Subjects Loyalty.</HI> As, we &s;ee, <HI>Virgil,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="48">
living in a Time, when the Republic of the <HI>Romans</HI> had given Place to Monarchy, made it the Purpo&s;e of his Poem, to reconcile his Countrymen to &s;ingle Sovereignty in the Per&s;on of <HI>Augu&s;tus:</HI> under Fiction of a Prince, brave, wi&s;e, and pious, who, being guided by the favouring <HI>Gods,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd, on the Ruins, of the old, a new Foundation, for Dominion of &s;o much more Potency, that the whole Empire of the World was, by Decree of Heaven, to be included in it.&mdash;From That new Empire, then po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by Tho&s;e he writ to, All his Readers had deriv'd their Glory: &s;o that it was ea&s;y to induce them to confide in, and to look for, the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ings from <HI>their</HI> Change of Government, which their great <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> had gain'd, by Change of Country.</P>
<P>To impre&s;s the Moral forcibly, &s;ome <HI>Action</HI> is to be related, pointing out an In&s;tance, in as &s;trong a Light as po&s;&s;ible, where this in&s;inuated Moral was prov'd good by an <HI>Example.</HI>&mdash;The Action mu&s;t be <HI>&s;uitable:</HI> That is, of Dignity adapted to the Greatne&s;s of Events wrought into it, as Steps toward the Re&s;ult la&s;t pur|pos'd. It mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ingle:</HI> That is, unmix'd with other Actions of detach'd, or independent Tendency. There may be Incidents producing Incidents, the more Variety the better: but they mu&s;t be &s;uch, as &s;erve but to bring forward, and illu&s;trate, the One final Action, which intends Example from the Work. Neither is <HI>this</HI> Re&s;triction any Nicety deduc'd from the particular Opinion of This Critic, or of That: It is a natural Nece&s;&s;ity; and a Law of Rea&s;on; becau&s;e Actions not producing one another, as Effects from Cau&s;es, rai&s;e unpointed, and con|fus'd Reflections; and divert, and weaken an Attention, which it is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of This Poem to bind down to one &s;trong Object. An Epic Poet, of the <HI>Ario&s;tine</HI> Model, is a Traveller, who, if his Road lay &s;trait through <HI>Crete,</HI> would take the <HI>Labyrinth,</HI> in his Journey.</P>
<P>The Action may be <HI>feign'd,</HI> or <HI>real:</HI> If no Story, fam'd in Hi&s;tory, can be directly levell'd to the Poet's Purpo&s;e, He may, then, invent one, to his Liking: For the <HI>Truth,</HI> here nece&s;&s;ary, con&s;i&s;ts not in the Reality of the Events, but in the natural Veracity exi&s;ting in the <HI>Moral.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Epi&s;odes</HI> are nece&s;&s;ary Members of extended Action: which, without them, would appear too &s;hort, and general.

<P>In general, the Note mo&s;t capable of height'ning our Regard to, and elucida|ting the a&s;&s;erted Force of <HI>Epic Poetry,</HI> is from a Recollection, that it comes down recommended to us by a Choice and Practice, that to Rea&s;on, joins the <HI>be&s;t</HI> AUTHORITY.&mdash;<HI>And without</HI> a Parable, <HI>&s;poke He not to them.</HI> Being a&s;k'd by his Di&s;ciples, WHY <HI>&s;peake&s;t thou to Them in Parables?</HI> His An&s;wer is, <HI>Becau&s;e to</HI> YOU <HI>it is given to under&s;tand the My&s;teries of the Kingdom of Heaven; but to</HI> THEM <HI>it is</HI> NOT <HI>given.</HI> That is, the Ob&s;tinacy of the&s;e People's Minds, mi&s;led by Habitudes of Evil, makes it nece&s;&s;ary, that the Doctrine, I would teach them, &s;hould be cover'd, and approach attractively: where, el&s;e, the Pride, that alienates their Hearts, would ri&s;e again&s;t <HI>Conviction,</HI> pre&s;s'd too plainly, and pro|pos'd <HI>without Di&s;gui&s;e</HI>; as Humble Men like <HI>you</HI> are willing to receive it.</P>
<P>It is probable, the <HI>Hebrews</HI> carried with 'em, out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> this delightful Way of teaching; It is clear, at lea&s;t, that they arriv'd to great Perfection in it, be|fore <HI>Greece</HI> grew civiliz'd from rude Barbarity. So far is it from true, that <HI>Homer,</HI> or &s;ome other Poet of his Country, was Inventer of the <HI>Epic</HI> Species. All the Books of the Old Te&s;tament abound with In&s;tances, which prove the Skill of <HI>Hebrew Poets.</HI> And the Six hundred thou&s;and Volumes in the <HI>Ptolemaic Library</HI> could hardly fail to have contain'd &s;ome of their Poems of this Kind, in their due Length and Dignity.</P>
<P>To &s;hew how little Difference there is, except in Ornament, and Size, between the Epic Poem, as above defined, and the &s;hort Parables, I have been &s;peaking of, I will &s;elect <HI>Two</HI> only: the fir&s;t, taken from the Mouth of <HI>Chri&s;t Him&s;elf.</HI> The other I will go &s;o far more backward for, as to the Reign of <HI>David,</HI> who was King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;o &s;oon after the <HI>Trojan War,</HI> that he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have liv'd before the Time of <HI>Homer,</HI> to whom <HI>Greece</HI> would partially a&s;cribe the Merit of poetically teaching moral Truth by Fable. I &s;hall give more In&s;tances than one, of the unwarrantable Pre&s;umption of tho&s;e <HI>Grecians</HI> Vanity, in arro|gating to Them&s;elves a Prai&s;e for Arts they borrow'd from the <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> People; and the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> in particular.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="50">The Per&s;ecution of the Prophets, by the <HI>Jewi&s;h Prie&s;ts,</HI> was what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> pur|pos'd to <HI>reprove:</HI> but knew, their Power was great; and that the Pride, It had in&s;pir'd 'em with, would render a di&s;ta&s;teful Doctrine little Fruit, if not en|gagingly in&s;inuated. Under this Conviction, the Divine Reprover thus addre&s;&s;es them. <Q>There liv'd, &s;ays he, in a far Country, a powerful Land-owner, who had planted Vineyards, rais'd Inclo&s;ures, and built habitable Farms, on a de|tach'd Part of his Territory. He let out The&s;e to Hu&s;bandmen; and went, Him&s;elf, to where his chief Seat &s;tood; upon a very di&s;tant Tract of his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.&mdash;When the proper Sea&s;on came, the Lord &s;ent Servants to demand his Rents grown due.

&mdash;The Auditors inflam'd to an impatient Indignation, interrupt the Story, in this Part of it, and cry out angrily&mdash; <Q>The Lord &s;hould have de&s;troyed Tho&s;e wicked Wretches, and let out his Vineyard to hone&s;ter Hu&s;bandmen.</Q>
And, there, condemn'd by their own Sentence, and &s;truck dumb by con&s;cious Shame, they catch the <HI>Application,</HI> before <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> pro|ceeds to make it: for, as the Text expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>They con&s;ider'd his Parable, and perceiv'd, that he &s;poke of</HI> Them.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd In&s;tance, <HI>Nathan</HI> reproaches <HI>David,</HI> who had robb'd <HI>Uriah</HI> of his Wife, and caus'd the Hu&s;band to be murder'd. But the Prophet, under|&s;tanding well the Danger of the King's Re&s;entment, ca&s;ts about to take him by Surprize, and does it under this Di&s;gui&s;e of <HI>Parable.</HI> <Q>I am come, &s;ays he, to a&s;k Relief from Royal Ju&s;tice, in Revenge of a poor Sufferer's Di&s;tre&s;s, again&s;t the Cruelty of his Oppre&s;&s;or. Two Men liv'd together: one rich, the other poor. The rich Man had exceeding many Flocks and Herds; but the poor Man had nothing, &s;ave one little Ewe-Lamb, which he had bought, and nouri&s;h'd up: and it grew up together with Him, and with his Children. It eat of his own Meat, and drank of his own Cup, and lay in his Bo&s;om, and was unto him as a Daughter. And there came a Traveller to the Rich Man: and he &s;par'd to take of his own Flock, but took the Poor Man's Lamb, and dre&s;s'd it, for the Man, that was come to him.</Q></P>
<P>What Effect this little Story pre&s;ently produc'd the Sequel tells us. <HI>And</HI> David<HI>'s Anger was greatly kindled again&s;t the Man: And he &s;aid to</HI> Nathan, <HI>As the Lord liveth, the Man, that has done This Thing, &s;hall &s;urely die, becau&s;e he had no Pity.</HI> And <HI>Nathan</HI> &s;aid to <HI>David,</HI> THOU <HI>art the Man.</HI> He, then, pro|ceeded, &s;afely, and reproached him, that he had tyrannically given way to an ille|gal Impul&s;e of De&s;ire; forcing away the only Wife, of a mo&s;t faithful Subject, notwith&s;tanding the unlimited Variety of Women, who were All His own. Had

<HI>Nathan</HI> &s;poke the Truth thus plainly, at its opening, It had prov'd, perhaps, of dangerous Con&s;equence to his own Life: but the Cloud of the Invention &s;hielded him; and the King's Pa&s;&s;ions having fir&s;t been artfully &s;ecur'd in the Reproacher's Intere&s;t, the Reproach'd, who had confe&s;s'd a generous Sen&s;e of the Di&s;hone&s;ty, while not con&s;ider'd as his own, became a&s;ham'd to di&s;avow his Virtue, when the Guilt laid Claim to his Confe&s;&s;ion. So <HI>David</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Nathan,</HI> <Q>&mdash;I have &s;inn'd again&s;t the Lord.</Q>
&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to produce a livelier, or more pathetic, Proof, both of the Nature and the Power of <HI>Epic Poetry:</HI> For it is evident, that the&s;e Two <HI>Parables</HI> differ in nothing, but their Want of Names, Extent, and Paint of Circum&s;tance, from the <HI>Poems</HI> of That Nomination.</P>
<P>From their general Nature, I proceed to the particular Con&s;ideration of this new Attempt, upon the Plan of <HI>Gideon.</HI></P>
<P>A Poet, in an Age &s;o factious as the La&s;t has been, mu&s;t have been blind, not to di&s;cern the U&s;efulne&s;s of recommending <HI>Quiet,</HI> to a &s;tormy Generation. It were &s;aying nothing to the Purpo&s;e, to object, that we are now remote from <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s Ca&s;e, under no Yoke of Conque&s;t, and above all Danger from a foreign Enemy. Civil Conte&s;t will be always the mo&s;t likely Means of calling in, and aid|ing the Attempts of, &s;uch an Enemy. We have &s;een too recent Proofs, to doubt that Certainty. But, not to dwell unnece&s;&s;arily upon our pre&s;ent happy Pro&s;pects, our invaded Ance&s;tors, too often, felt the Weight of &s;uch a Situation, as had made a <HI>Gideon</HI> the mo&s;t welcome Public Ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;Could they have <HI>found</HI> him, and could all his <HI>Miracles</HI> have &s;erv'd but to unite them in <HI>one</HI> Wi&s;h, and <HI>one</HI> Endeavour, far le&s;s la&s;ting, and le&s;s bloody, had Tho&s;e various In&s;ults, then, been repre&s;ented, under the Di&s;grace whereof our Hi&s;tory blu&s;hes, while it tells the Triumphs of &s;o many Conque&s;ts over us,&mdash;by <HI>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</HI> and <HI>Normans!</HI>&mdash;Where, therefore, is the Nation to be found, that better ought to like, than Ours, a &s;trong <HI>Example,</HI> to &s;o &s;ound a Moral, as, that <HI>tho' Di&s;union &s;hould en&s;lave a People, joint Attachment to the Legal Government could &s;oon recover, and protect lo&s;t Liberty?</HI></P>
<P>To cloathe this Moral in an <HI>Action,</HI> &s;ome &s;uch di&s;united People was to be made Choice of, &s;uff'ring under foreign Conque&s;t, from Effect of their Divi&s;ions, and, when every human Hope had fail'd 'em, rais'd, at once, from their De&s;pair, by Union of an incon&s;iderable Number, under a Re&s;torer of their Laws and Freedom.</P>
<P>This being what the Critics call the Allegorical, or General, Plan, I never could have found a fitter <HI>Action</HI> to illu&s;trate it, than the Redemption of the <HI>He|brews,</HI> under <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Conduct, from the Yoke of foreign Conque&s;t, as impos'd with infinite Contempt and Cruelty, by a confederate Body of <HI>Arabian</HI> Princes; whom the &s;acred Writ di&s;tingui&s;hes by the joint Name of <HI>Midianites.</HI> For the Events of this great War are, <HI>there,</HI> &s;o comprehen&s;ively related, as to &s;uit at once with the De&s;ign, they are &s;elected for, and leave &s;ufficient Scope for bold Invention, and Embelli&s;hment, in the particular Deduction. Whereas the Scripture Hi&s;tory of <HI>David</HI> (Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>'s Choice) was a <HI>completed</HI> one, as Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> has objected to it, and is &s;o circum&s;tantially de&s;crib'd, as to re&s;train a

Poet's Fancy. Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> for this Rea&s;on, could not have &s;ucceeded, in That favourite De&s;ign of His, for forming a new Epic Poem from the Story of our Civil Wars in the la&s;t Century. Yet, I remember he has &s;omewhere told us, that King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, whom he had acquainted with his Purpo&s;e, very much approv'd it: notwith&s;tanding which, I take it to have been to the Advan|tage of That Great Man's Memory, that his De&s;ign was never executed. The Story was too recent, to be treated, as it ought; and the &s;ublime&s;t Beauties of Invention would have lo&s;t their Force on Readers, in whom &s;ad and deep Impre&s;|&s;ions, from the Mi&s;ery of the real Facts, mu&s;t needs have made All Fiction &s;eem too <HI>&s;portive,</HI> and an unbecoming Freedom taken with their &s;olemn Sorrow. It was the very Ca&s;e of <HI>Lucan</HI>; and his Subject barring out all Aids of the Poetic Kind, at lea&s;t Tho&s;e warm ones, which let loo&s;e Imagination, his <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI> gain'd no Rank but among <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI>; and <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> indeed, is all the Right of That great Work to be con&s;ider'd, as a <HI>Poem.</HI></P>
<P>The Mention, here, of Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> leads me to remember an Objection, which, I think, he has unju&s;tly made to Mr. <HI>Cowley</HI>'s Choice of Subject, merely as a foreign one: as if it were a Violation of that natural Re&s;pect, a Poet owes his Country, to look out of it, for a great Character! If Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI> had no better Rea&s;on for this Cen&s;ure, than that &s;ince <HI>Homer</HI> was a <HI>Grecian,</HI> and has writ of <HI>Greeks,</HI> and <HI>Virgil,</HI> being a <HI>Roman,</HI> writ of <HI>Romans,</HI> therefore, Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> as an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> &s;hould have approv'd no other than an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hero, the Argu|ment appears, to me, to be a very narrow, and mean-&s;pirited one.&mdash;Nature is Nature every-where; and I &s;hould never look for any Force of manly Rea&s;oning, from a Soul not large enough, to comprehend Mankind as One Fraternity.&mdash; However, more is to be &s;aid, in Favour of a <HI>Hebrew</HI> Subject, than of All, or Any of, the Re&s;t, whatever.&mdash;The Reverence, we conceive, from the Old Te&s;tament, for Tho&s;e Objects of God's more immediate Care, has made Them <HI>Every Body's Countrymen.</HI> Be&s;ides, the many <HI>Miracles,</HI> &s;o terribly di&s;play'd among them, are peculiar Helps, to a Poetic Fancy; and adorn their Hi&s;tory, above that of <HI>Any</HI> other Nation. Their Country was the Scene, too, of our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Life, and Sufferings, a Reflection, which entitles it to Veneration, from All <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> And, to add one &s;maller Circum&s;tance, that &s;till gives Strength|'ning to their Claim, They were Inventers, or, at lea&s;t, Improvers, and great Practi&s;ers, of <HI>Poetry.</HI> The <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> their fir&s;t Leader, li&s;ts Him early in the Number.&mdash;<HI>Miriam, Deborah, David, Solomon,</HI> and innumerable other of their Nation, were fine Poets. And This ought, methinks, to recommend their Memory to the Re&s;pect of &s;uch, who would be thought &s;o, after them.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, the Reader, I believe, will hardly be di&s;pleas'd to &s;ee a <HI>Specimen</HI> of <HI>Hebrew Poetry.</HI> We meet with many noble ones, in the Old Te&s;ta|ment; but they have the Misfortune to lie &s;hadow'd under ob&s;olete Tran&s;lation. &mdash;One of our Critics has done Ju&s;tice to the noble Images of the&s;e Originals, when he declares, that <HI>there is nothing, &s;o &s;oft, &s;o tender, and pathetic, and at
<PB N="45" REF="53">
the &s;ame Time, nothing &s;o grand, &s;o maje&s;tic, &s;o terrible; and &s;o barmonious, as the Poetic Part of the Bible: to which All the Heathen Ver&s;e is flat, and low.</HI></P>
<P>I look upon the <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, was written in <HI>Hexameter Ver&s;e,</HI> to have been a Kind of <HI>Lyric Ode,</HI> becau&s;e it &s;eems to have been &s;ung, to &s;ome String-Mu&s;ic, and to certain mea&s;ur'd Motions of the Body. This is plainly gather'd from the Text. <Q>And <HI>Miriam</HI> the Prophete&s;s, the Si&s;ter of <HI>Aaron,</HI> took a <HI>Timbrel</HI> in her Hand, and all the Women follow'd her, with <HI>Timbrels,</HI> and with <HI>Dances.</HI></Q>
&mdash;And, when <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the male Singers, had open'd the Ode, <HI>Miriam,</HI> and the Women, an&s;wer'd, as a <HI>Chorus,</HI> <Q>Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumph'd gloriou&s;ly: The Hor&s;e, and his Rider, hath he thrown into the Sea!</Q></P>

<P>What they have objected may, I think, be &s;umm'd up in the&s;e few Particulars. <HI>Rhyme</HI> was a <HI>Goth,</HI> and came in with the <HI>Runic</HI> Impolitene&s;s: Rhyme is <HI>unnatural:</HI> becau&s;e it puts Con&s;traint upon Expre&s;&s;ion: Rhyme is <HI>needle&s;s</HI>; becau&s;e Blank Ver&s;e has nobler Harmony, and gives complete Delight without it.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of The&s;e, 'tis quite mi&s;taken.

Its Frame contains from 50 to 100 Ladies: the two leading Ver&s;es rhyme together, and the Re&s;t alternatively, ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ping&punc; throughout, but two Rhymes only.

<P>They call Rhyme <HI>unnatural,</HI> becau&s;e it puts Con&s;traint upon Expre&s;&s;ion; which, however, is <HI>not true</HI>; for Poets have not only Liberty of <HI>changing</HI> &s;tubborn Rhymes for ductile ones, but are <HI>oblig'd to do it,</HI> till they find &s;uch new ones, as <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> the Sen&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;tiffening, or ob&s;curing it.

<P>Rhyme, then, is neither <HI>newer,</HI> in its Practice, nor le&s;s <HI>natural,</HI> in its U&s;e, than other Licences to Ver&s;e, which, yet, its Enemies are very partially attach'd to.&mdash;We will &s;ee, in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Charge, whether It ought to be held <HI>needle&s;s,</HI> from Superiority of Harmony, or any nobler, or more ma&s;culine Perfection in <HI>Blank Ver&s;e</HI>&mdash;or Mea&s;ure without Con&s;onance.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Ro&s;common,</HI> one of the fir&s;t Fallers in with the Applau&s;e of <HI>Milton</HI> (newly, in <HI>His</HI> Time, beginning to attract Con&s;enters), writes his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on tran&s;|lated Ver&s;e,</HI> in the be&s;t <HI>Rhyme</HI> he found Him&s;elf at Lei&s;ure to afford it: But, drawing near the End, and growing out of Humour with his Choice, breaks out at once into a rapturous Declamation, again&s;t <HI>Rhyme,</HI> and <HI>Bondage</HI>; in a Specimen, which he picks, here and there, and pieces artfully together, out of &s;ome of the &s;ublime&s;t Parts of <HI>Paradi&s;e lo&s;t,</HI> to recommend Blank Ver&s;e, where He, Him&s;elf, had ju&s;t been di&s;regarding it. I think this Manner of proceeding not a fair one: The &s;trong Images, which animate the glowing Lines, he there &s;elected, would have made <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> Poetry. They &s;hake the Fancy, and allow no Lei&s;ure to the Judgment to examine <HI>Numbers.</HI>&mdash;We are hurried on by the Exaltedne&s;s of Thought, and ri&s;e above Perception of the Mechani&s;m!

<P>But now, to let the Reader &s;ee, what Kind of Ver&s;e it is, the&s;e Gentlemen would &s;ub&s;titute in Place of Rhyme, I take the following Pattern from the men|tion'd Lord's Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Ars Poetica.</HI></P>

What has been hinted, of <HI>Italian,</HI> will effectually include the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI>; the <HI>German</HI> mu&s;t be own'd worth great Regard for its Antiquity, and Manline&s;s; but will content it&s;elf with That ju&s;t Prai&s;e, and claim no Merit from its Harmony. Whatever Roughne&s;s <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> may be thought to have retain'd, is but of <HI>Saxon Origin</HI>; and, to acknowlege a too obvious Truth, Poetry in <HI>High-Dutch,</HI> is like the <HI>Nile</HI> among its <HI>Cataracts:</HI> It may be rapid, and deep; but 'tis tumbling, and terrible: It has its Cour&s;e ob&s;tructed, every-where, by Mountains it mu&s;t clamber over.&mdash;To carry Poetry &s;till further North, would be but drag|ging her to &s;eek for Friends, among her Enemies, the <HI>Goths,</HI> and <HI>Vandals.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> then, of modern Tongues, is fitted be&s;t for Poetry. Its copious Choice of <HI>Mono&s;yllables</HI> (which many have been ra&s;h enough to call a <HI>Blemi&s;h</HI>) make it &s;trong, &s;ignificant, and comprehen&s;ive. Its Derivatives, from <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> have adorn'd it with Variety of Cadences; and intermix'd its ma&s;culine Exce&s;s of Con&s;onants with a melodious Fluency, from interpo&s;ing Vowels.&mdash;It adorns, and is adorn'd by, <HI>Rhyme</HI>; yet takes it in but as a Subject, not obeys it, as her Tyrant: It is grave, &s;low, &s;tately, &s;oft, &s;wift, wanton, or maje&s;tic. It
<PB N="58" REF="66">
has all the Lentor of Complaint and Pity; yet has all the Tran&s;port of excur&s;ive Energy: It is an inexhau&s;tibly full Trea&s;ury, &s;upplied from the &s;elected Tributes of whatever was mo&s;t excellent, in other Speeches; but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es them with &s;o improv'd an Aptitude, as to have made <HI>That</HI> HONEY, which was raw <HI>Juice,</HI> in the Flowers It drew it from.</P>
<P>But I digre&s;s too far from what I had begun to &s;ay, upon the Structure of my Ver&s;e, which differs little from a Species, Mr. <HI>Cowley,</HI> toward the Clo&s;e of the la&s;t Century, fir&s;t reduc'd to Practice, and mi&s;nam'd <HI>Pindaric:</HI> But if he conceiv'd a <HI>Greek</HI> Name nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>Dithyrambic</HI> had, I think, expre&s;s'd his Pur|po&s;e better. From the Latitude of &s;o diver&s;ify'd a Numero&s;ity, there mu&s;t ari&s;e a fuller Harmony, than can con&s;i&s;t with common Mea&s;ure. El&s;e, a Concert can be equall'd by a &s;ingle In&s;trument: our u&s;ual Couplet-writing &s;ooner &s;atiates, by too frequent, and too limited Returns, of the &s;ame Mea&s;ure. Whereas, in this perpetual Change of Cadence, and new Cour&s;e of Numbers, the Attention is beat up, provok'd, and render'd lively; the Ear, every-where, reliev'd; and Images of Actions, Sounds, or Things, how different &s;oever they may be, are cloath'd with Words, be&s;t &s;uited to their Nature.</P>
<P>The Compa&s;s, and the Freedom of this Range of Ver&s;e, have recommended its Attempt to many Practi&s;ers in <HI>Odes,</HI> and &s;uch brief Sallies; but, too generally, with bad Succe&s;s: They check'd the Gracefulne&s;s of Stepping, by too vi&s;ible a <HI>Fear</HI> to <HI>fall.</HI> Like Children, who, fir&s;t learn to go alone, they took &s;hort, tottering Starts; and hung upon, and re&s;ted at, All &s;topping Places, they could &s;tretch their Hands to. They confin'd their Mu&s;e, too humbly, to a <HI>Lyric</HI> Length of Leading-&s;trings: and gave the &s;nug, &s;et, round-head <HI>Crop,</HI> to Stanzas, that &s;hould flow out <HI>cavalierly. Pindaric,</HI> in &s;hort Mea&s;ure, is a Woman of Quality, in Knee-deep Petticoats; &s;he may have very well-&s;hap'd Feet: but they can never be &s;o fine, as to atone the <HI>Indecorum. Lyric</HI> Numbers carry &s;ong-like and familiar Levity, quite incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Epic</HI> Gravity. A few bold Writers of <HI>Pindaric Odes</HI> have ventur'd, now-and-then, as far as the <HI>Hexameter:</HI> but hardly dar'd &s;o much as dream of the <HI>Heptametrical</HI> &s;even-footed Line, of fourteen Syllables: Indeed the &s;horte&s;t Mea&s;ure is too long, unle&s;s That Length is fill'd with Meaning. For nothing can be more ridiculous, than a weak lan|gui&s;hing Extent of Ver&s;e without proportion'd Vigour in the Sentiment: Such Ver&s;e plays loo&s;e, like &s;ome va&s;t main Sail of a Ship, that flags, and flutters heavily upon the Pro&s;pect of a Breeze, but pre&s;ently falls back again&s;t the Ma&s;t, for want of <HI>Wind,</HI> to &s;well it into Energy. It is in Poems &s;uch as The&s;e, where, as was paintedly expre&s;s'd by Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> (but might have been <HI>&s;till more &s;o,</HI> by his length'ning out his &s;econd Ver&s;e to the <HI>Heptameter</HI> Extent ju&s;t mentioned, and hereunder given it by an Addition only of the <HI>two</HI> &s;mall Words, in <HI>Roman</HI> Cha|racters)</P>

<P>This Line begins the PROPOSITION, (and the Progre&s;s of the Section &s;pecifies the ACTION, of the Poem.)&mdash;In its Opening, it is <HI>general</HI>&mdash;to teach, in the Ex|ample of the Leader nam'd, that the In&s;pir'd by Heaven are to apprehend no Danger, from the mo&s;t unequal Oppo&s;ition: all <HI>divided</HI> Power becoming weaker, on Exertion; while <HI>united</HI> moves <HI>direct,</HI> and &s;till grows &s;tronger, in That Motion.

<P>In the fir&s;t Place, I can &s;ee no Rea&s;on, why, becau&s;e One Man has undertaken to de&s;cribe a War, and prov'd not equal to his Enterprize, Another therefore &s;hould be <HI>arrogant,</HI> in but propo&s;ing the &s;ame Subject. And, as to <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> of Propo&s;ition, for the want of which the Writer is here treated ill by <HI>Horace,</HI> and accus'd of <HI>Noi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>O&s;tentation,</HI> I am frank enough to dare confe&s;s, that the <HI>Immode&s;ty,</HI> if there is Any here, lies too conceal'd for my Di&s;cernment. Pray, what could any Author, who de&s;ign'd That Subject, have contriv'd to &s;ay upon it, <HI>le&s;s,</HI> when he was entering on the Propo&s;ition of it? Where is the too much <HI>Fire</HI> in his Beginning? Smoke in the Progre&s;s can be nothing to our Purpo&s;e: why is there more of <HI>Pomp</HI> expre&s;s'd, or why more Expectation rais'd, from a plain Promi&s;e to de&s;cribe the Ruin of <HI>one Town,</HI> and Death of <HI>one Man,</HI> than to &s;hew the <HI>Manners</HI> of <HI>many Men,</HI> and treat on the Affairs of <HI>many Cities?</HI> If we were not to expect Accounts, of not alone the Things <HI>Uly&s;&s;es &s;aw,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>why</HI> he &s;aw them, to what End then did <HI>Homer</HI> promi&s;e any thing about 'em, in his Propo&s;ition? If we were to entertain That Expectation, certainly our Hopes are higher rais'd by <HI>Homer,</HI> who a&s;&s;ures us, we &s;hall hear of many Cities, and of many Men, than by the <HI>other,</HI> who propos'd to &s;et before us but the Ruin of one City, and one Man's De&s;truction.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Narrowne&s;s</HI> in the&s;e implicit Reverencers. They under&s;tand, and follow in their Author's Rear, with a too creeping, and too blind Servility. Who <HI>reads,</HI> and is not <HI>Horace</HI>'s Admirer? and yet, <HI>who</HI> &s;hall be afraid of &s;aying, He would better have in&s;tructed us, by &s;ome intelligible plain Precept, on this Point, of <HI>Propo&s;itions,</HI> than by Two ill-under&s;tood, and wide Examples?&mdash;To conclude with my own humble Notion of the Matter, He certainly propo&s;es well, who comprehends within his Propo&s;ition, the Extent of his whole Meaning, and adds nothing further: And <HI>He errs,</HI> as certainly, who, being &s;crupulou&s;ly terrified, by Words without a Rea&s;on, is kept back by groundle&s;s Fear of &s;aying more, than This or That Man would have &s;aid upon the Subject, and &s;ays <HI>le&s;s,</HI> than his own Meaning calls for.</P>

<P>Sect. VII. L. 5.&mdash;<HI>To The&s;e old</HI> Amalek <HI>her Standards join'd.</HI></P>
<P>This numerous and mighty Nation will have Place at large, among the Notes of the &s;ucceeding Book. They were the <HI>Hebrew's fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;ure&s;t</HI> Enemies: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e, <HI>They,</HI> fir&s;t, attack'd 'em, in their March; when they were <HI>beaten,</HI> under <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI>&mdash;And <HI>&s;ure&s;t,</HI> as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> receiv'd particular Command from GOD, never to make Peace with the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> but pur&s;ue, till they had quite eradica|ted them. And this, at la&s;t, they very nearly had accompli&s;h'd, after many hundred Years were pa&s;t, fir&s;t. What, in this Affair, I find lea&s;t comprehen&s;ible, is, GOD's remembring, for a People, who Them&s;elves had long forgot, this Right to Vengeance. They appear to have de&s;erv'd it very little: it being <HI>after</HI> their <HI>Rejection</HI> of His Care concerning them. I am at &s;ome Lo&s;s, therefore, to account for the &s;urpri&s;ing Rigour of the Cur&s;e denounc'd on <HI>Saul,</HI> by <HI>Samuel,</HI> three hundred and fifty Years after the Injury receiv'd: in Puni&s;hment of but a generous <HI>Pity,</HI> &s;hewn to <HI>Agag,</HI> when his Pri&s;oner.

<P>The <HI>Hebrews,</HI> after <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was dead, concluded only a &s;light War, of little Con&s;equence, in the South Parts of <HI>Judah,</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Phinehas</HI>; and then, with one concurrent Lap&s;e from any further Application to their in&s;tituted Modes of military Practice under general Attachment to <HI>dependent Regulation,</HI> threw That Care, in a <HI>divided</HI> Tru&s;t, to their provincial Heads of Tribes: who, now, had their allotted <HI>Severalties,</HI> in Territory, and in Civil, and <HI>Palatinate</HI> Preten&s;ions: and fell in with the whole People's Di&s;po&s;ition to improve, and cul|tivate their <HI>Lands</HI>; drinking (as the Text expre&s;&s;es this De&s;ertion of the Public Duty, for the private Intere&s;t) <HI>Every Man under his own Vine, and</HI> eating <HI>under his own Fig-tree.</HI></P>
<P>This univer&s;al Spirit of Defection met too little Oppo&s;ition, from a Want of due Attention in their <HI>prie&s;tly Sovereigns,</HI> to the <HI>Civil</HI> Branch of their Prerogative, and of the <HI>Military</HI> &s;till more willingly; as from their Turn of Education, le&s;s adapted to its Duties.

<P>The Knot had long been loo&s;ening; but Love of Ea&s;e, and Ta&s;te of Luxury, now all at once di&s;&s;olv'd it.&mdash;Till this fatal Lure, in their detach'd Divi&s;ions of the <HI>Land,</HI> the Want of Property among Particulars &s;u&s;tain'd no other than the

<P>Plenty in Ea&s;e was the fir&s;t Step toward Anarchy: It drew on Di&s;regard of public Happine&s;s: The next was Wealth with Luxury; to which &s;ucceeded Pride; and That, in natural Con&s;equence, produc'd Contempt of Law; &s;oon follow'd by Defiance of Authority.

<P>The Progre&s;s of all This was natural.&mdash;It help'd 'em little, that they &s;till had Strength enough, to have repuls'd their Enemies. The <HI>Feet</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> like Tho&s;e in the Old Fable, of <HI>Menenius Agrippa,</HI> thought it hard, that they &s;hould work to <HI>feed</HI> the <HI>Stomach:</HI> and de&s;troy'd them&s;elves in not &s;u&s;taining, what they were <HI>&s;u&s;tain'd by.</HI>&mdash;While tho&s;e proud <HI>Hebrews</HI> multiplied their Claims into lean <HI>Inde|pendencies, Exemptions,</HI> and <HI>Immunities,</HI> they were pluck'd, One by One, away, like the Hairs of <HI>Sertorius</HI>'s <HI>Hor&s;e-Tail,</HI> which if pull'd at, <HI>All together,</HI> had been found irradicable.&mdash;It is in Bodies Politic the &s;ame, as in a Body Natural: In the Rapidity of &s;ome wild Race, a Man perceives a gaping <HI>Pit,</HI> before him; what a Happine&s;s, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, to have the Seat of Coun&s;el, and of Power, the &s;ame!

The <HI>Romans</HI> call'd it <HI>Pilum,</HI> and became &s;o fond of it, that they affected to be thought Inventors of its U&s;e: &s;o much is certain, that they met no Enemy, who us'd this Weapon; for what el&s;e can <HI>Lucan</HI> mean, when, in de&s;cribing the <HI>Phar&s;alian War,</HI> he tells us that <HI>Piles threatened Piles?</HI> Had other Nations been <HI>&s;o</HI> arm'd, This might have been the Ca&s;e, in <HI>any</HI> of their Wars. But &s;ince the U&s;e was proper to the <HI>Romans,</HI> to &s;ay <HI>Javelins</HI> again&s;t <HI>Javelins</HI> &s;erv'd as &s;trongly to expre&s;s a <HI>Civil</HI> War, as if he had &s;aid <HI>Romans</HI> again&s;t <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>The People of <HI>Rome</HI> could not have borrow'd it from <HI>Greece,</HI> becau&s;e we find in <HI>Livy,</HI> that They us'd it before any Intercour&s;e had yet been open'd with That Nation. And be&s;ide, the <HI>Greeks</HI> them&s;elves had, then, di&s;us'd the Javelin: and been train'd to the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Practice, of long <HI>Pikes,</HI> of four and twenty Foot; in Bodies, which con&s;i&s;ted of a Thou&s;and in the Front, and Sixteen Men in File: &s;ometimes, reduc'd to only <HI>Eight</HI> in Depth, the Ranks thereby extending to a double Length, when they would &s;hun the Danger of being charg'd in <HI>Rear,</HI> by Enemies, who might <HI>out-wing</HI> them. In this Order, they compos'd a firm, im|penetrable, and, on plain Ground, &s;carce re&s;i&s;tible oblong Figure, call'd a <HI>Pha|lanx:</HI> where the Soldiers, arm'd defen&s;ively with Helmets, Ta&s;&s;ets, Cor&s;lets, Bra&s;s-Boots, and Targets, clo&s;ing Ranks, and propping and &s;u&s;taining one another, with their Pikes pre&s;ented over the preceding Shoulders, like the <HI>Quills</HI> of <HI>Porcu|pines,</HI> 'tis ea&s;y to imagine what Impre&s;&s;ion &s;uch a well-compacted Weight was capable of making; and how firmly It &s;upported Charges from an Enemy; unle&s;s where Ditches, Hills, or other Inequalities of Ground, di&s;turb'd, and broke their Order into little Gaps, or Intervals, at which (as in the Example of <HI>Aemilius,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Per&s;es,</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Pydna</HI>) the <HI>Roman</HI> Legionary <HI>Maniples</HI> forc'd Entrance, and a&s;&s;aulting them in <HI>Flank,</HI> with their &s;hort Swords, gain'd frequent, and con&s;iderable Victories.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Pilum,</HI> 'tis mo&s;t probable the <HI>Romans</HI> had it, with their <HI>Trojan</HI> Found|ers, who no doubt brought into <HI>Italy,</HI> All Weapons they had been accu&s;tom'd to, before their Emigration. <HI>Vegetius</HI> and <HI>Polybius,</HI> Both, de&s;cribe this <HI>Pilum,</HI> but a little <HI>differently.</HI> As far as can be gather'd out of <HI>Roman Tactics,</HI> It was a Staff, of weighty Wood, of four Foot long, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Steel,</HI> one End of it was fa&s;ten'd into. This Steel Head was triangular, in Length two Foot, and very &s;harply edg'd, and pointed; &s;o that the whole Length of the Javelin was about <HI>Six Foot:</HI> It was large&s;t, where remote&s;t from the Iron (though &s;ometimes

they are de&s;crib'd as double-headed): The poizing Place, for Gra&s;p, was com|monly about an Inch and a Quarter in Diameter.</P>
<P>The Legionary Foot, All, carried this peculiar mi&s;&s;ile Weapon: and could hurl it with &s;urpri&s;ing Aim, and Force, again&s;t an Enemy. The Manner of their ca&s;ting it was thus&mdash;When the fir&s;t Rank ob&s;erv'd the Di&s;tance within Reach, they threw their Javelins, point-blank, and &s;unk immediately upon one Knee, to give the &s;econd Rank uninterrupted Sight, who, then, threw al&s;o, and knelt down, to give the &s;ame Advantage to the <HI>Third.</HI> And thus, when <HI>Ten</HI> whole Ranks had thrown &s;ucce&s;&s;ively (which was di&s;patch'd with an uncea&s;ing Swiftne&s;s, and Agility), They &s;tarted up together, with a general Shout, drew All their Swords at once, and &s;o ru&s;h'd in upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>What terrible Effects have been produc'd by Javelins, we have innumerable In&s;tances in Hi&s;tory: but none more worthy Notice, than That Great one, at <HI>Phar&s;alia</HI>; where <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> with his u&s;ual Skill, fore&s;eeing, that <HI>Pompey's Hor&s;e,</HI> compos'd of the mo&s;t warm, and fiery Spirits of the <HI>Roman</HI> Youth of the Patrician Hou&s;es, would be endeavouring to fall in upon his Rear, on That Wing, where his own few Hor&s;emen were exceedingly out-reach'd, by <HI>Pompey</HI>'s, He plac'd, in oblique Line, extending from behind the &s;o-expos'd and threatened Flank of Cavalry, &s;ix cho&s;en Cohorts of his veteran <HI>Foot</HI> (which made about Three thou&s;and Men) and order'd The&s;e, when they receiv'd the Squadrons in their coming round upon 'em, to aim All their Javelins <HI>at the Faces only</HI> of Tho&s;e gay young Chargers. It &s;ucceeded, to his Wi&s;h. The Hor&s;e came furiou&s;ly <HI>about:</HI> but &s;tarting unexpectedly on this Re&s;erve of &s;uch experienc'd Wounders, were receiv'd with &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Showers of <HI>Javelins,</HI> in their Eyes, Cheeks, Necks, and Foreheads, that unable to &s;upport the Horror of &s;uch maim'd, and mi&s;erable Faces (for the Hor&s;e had no <HI>Vant-braces</HI> to their Helmets), they All turn'd their Backs precipitately, and di&s;ordering their own <HI>Foot,</HI> lo&s;t <HI>Pompey</HI> that important Day; and gave the World to <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>

<P>Such a Light enlarg'd the Influence of <HI>Gideon</HI>'s Virtues. It is not from the Merit of the Truths, he has been recommending, that the Senators derive their Warmth of Admiration.

<P>It is probable, in actual Truth, that The&s;e ten Servants, who, the Text &s;ays, aided <HI>Gideon,</HI> in the Night (for Fear of the Inhabitants of <HI>Ophra,</HI> and the Re&s;t of their own Family), were Per&s;ons, whom He had engag'd to his particular Intere&s;t, by Effect of &s;ome uncommon Obligation; It being impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould not have <HI>fore&s;een</HI> the Uproar and Re&s;entment, which attended their Pre&s;umption: and no Ordinary Temptation had prevail'd on Men of Their expos'd Condition, to pro|voke &s;o vi&s;ible a Hazard.</P>

The Truth is, It is not a long String of &s;uch &s;hort Words, that makes Ver&s;e <HI>jar</HI> upon the Ear.&mdash;Short Syllables, when they are <HI>Words,</HI> may, by judicious Intermixture of the <HI>Vowels,</HI> with the Con&s;onants, &s;ucceed Each other with as &s;mooth a Cadence, as can Syllables, which are but <HI>Parts</HI> of Words.&mdash;The &s;tudied Roughne&s;s, in this Ver&s;e of Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, ari&s;es only from a refluent Relu|ctance of its Accents to concur, in That <HI>In&s;ertion</HI> into one Another, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to make Words harmonious.

But, in Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s, the Words are purpo&s;ely &s;o <HI>cho&s;en,</HI> that Each Syllable requires <HI>Emphatical Expan&s;ion:</HI> and, in That Ca&s;e, there can be no <HI>Mu&s;ic,</HI> for the very Rea&s;on, that makes Difference betwixt the <HI>Tolling out one Bell,</HI> and ringing a whole <HI>Belfry.</HI></P>
